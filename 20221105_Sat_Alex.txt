[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  It's Saturday, November 5th, 2022.
[00:09.000 --> 00:15.000]  This is an emergency Saturday transmission on Alice Jones.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  Coming up, he's about to be in studio with us.
[00:26.000 --> 00:29.000]  We're going to do an in-depth two-hour interview.
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  Commercial free with Dr. Peter McCullough,
[00:32.000 --> 00:37.000]  completely vindicated, predicting the lab origins of the deadly virus
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.000]  and the even more deadly shot.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  Uncensored, unfiltered, what the enemy fears above all else
[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  is real information.
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  It's coming up in mere minutes on this special Saturday transmission.
[00:51.000 --> 00:54.000]  Whether you're watching this at Infowars.com, the streams,
[00:54.000 --> 00:56.000]  whether you're listening to it on the radio stations,
[00:56.000 --> 01:01.000]  go to band.video and take this archive once the show has streamed out
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  and share it, band.video.
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07.000 --> 01:10.000]  Wow, so much to talk about, so many big developments.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  You know, I said earlier in the week,
[01:12.000 --> 01:15.000]  I was going to come in here on Saturday.
[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000]  I had so many Elon Musk questions.
[01:17.000 --> 01:21.000]  I had so many Kanye West questions.
[01:21.000 --> 01:22.000]  Are they good?
[01:22.000 --> 01:23.000]  Are they bad?
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.000]  I'll spend some time on that, but they're a bigger fish to fry.
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  I just know this.
[01:29.000 --> 01:32.000]  The power structure is coming after Kanye West, yay.
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  They're coming after Elon Musk.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  I'm not saying Elon Musk is a great guy.
[01:37.000 --> 01:43.000]  I just know the ADL, George Soros, they're boycotting,
[01:43.000 --> 01:45.000]  they're censoring, they're attacking.
[01:45.000 --> 01:48.000]  Twitter had to fire 50% of its employees
[01:48.000 --> 01:53.000]  or then get news like this that yay in a conversation last night
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  told me and no one broke this, but info wars.com
[01:56.000 --> 02:01.000]  that he has been suspended for seven days on Twitter.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  And the question is, did Elon Musk do this?
[02:03.000 --> 02:05.000]  No, Elon Musk is not even in control of the company yet.
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  Now down the road, if he doesn't restore him,
[02:07.000 --> 02:09.000]  we know there's censorship going on and that's wrong,
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  but that's the big exclusive news on that front.
[02:13.000 --> 02:22.000]  But we've got the midterms now in just three days.
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  The polls open in 64 hours,
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  and we know there's the biggest red wave in history,
[02:29.000 --> 02:31.000]  a total political realignment,
[02:31.000 --> 02:33.000]  but just like we just saw in Brazil,
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  they are going to try to steal it like Lula has done from Bolsonaro.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  But Bolsonaro is not backing down
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  and that country is in full revolution.
[02:44.000 --> 02:45.000]  So this is do or die time.
[02:45.000 --> 02:47.000]  And I'll obviously be back tomorrow night,
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  four to six p.m. myself.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  I'll enjoy your six to eight p.m. with Sunday Live.
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  I'll be back weekday mornings.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  Bradford Harris and Smith in American Journal at 8 a.m.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  We're live at 11 a.m.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  And Tuesday, we're going to have live coverage
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  right through to the wee hours of this historic election,
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  which in key battleground states,
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  Federman and Obama, 2.0, Biden,
[03:11.000 --> 03:14.000]  have all told us are going to be held up
[03:14.000 --> 03:15.000]  because they've got to have time
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  to get all those special ballots they've got ready
[03:19.000 --> 03:22.000]  stuffed in to the situation.
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.000]  So that's all coming up today
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  and tonight on the Special Emergency Broadcast.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  But I wanted to talk about the big picture
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  of the Cuban tyranny
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  and how the globalists are begging for mercy
[03:36.000 --> 03:37.000]  and saying they want to cover the amnesty
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  while they still try to inject our children
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  with poison shots.
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  They know we're a massing group of people worldwide,
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  including a lot of top scientists and doctors
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  that know what's really happening.
[03:48.000 --> 03:49.000]  And they know they're beginning to lose.
[03:49.000 --> 03:50.000]  So now they want to claim,
[03:50.000 --> 03:52.000]  we're not going to attack us with bio weapons anymore,
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  but we know that's not the case.
[03:54.000 --> 03:55.000]  They're going to come back with them
[03:55.000 --> 03:58.000]  over and over and over again.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  And so now more than ever,
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  we cannot give amnesty to these monsters.
[04:03.000 --> 04:04.000]  We'll be talking about it
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  with Dr. Peter McCulloch coming up.
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  But I wanted to play a clip, clip two,
[04:08.000 --> 04:09.000]  from Russell Brand,
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  who I've known for 15 years.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  He's been on the show many times.
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  I've met with him before here in Austin
[04:15.000 --> 04:17.000]  for some reason about a contact with him for five years.
[04:17.000 --> 04:18.000]  Can't get on a show.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  Can't get him on,
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  even though he said nice things about me on Joe Rogan.
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  But he did a great analysis of the new
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  so-called UK Prime Minister
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  and the Mega Digital Bank Cashless Society.
[04:30.000 --> 04:31.000]  They're pushing.
[04:31.000 --> 04:32.000]  Here's a clip of Russell Brand.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  Central Bank Digital Currencies, CBDCs.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  Central Bank Digital Currencies
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  could be a digital version of money,
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  a bit like a digital banknote.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  I like it, exactly.
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  I've got a broad concept.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  What if this person's an idiot,
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  which we think that they are?
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  It's like a digital penny
[04:50.000 --> 04:51.000]  for your digital money box,
[04:51.000 --> 04:53.000]  for your digital shithole that you live in.
[04:53.000 --> 04:54.000]  You will owe nothing.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  You will be happy.
[04:56.000 --> 04:59.000]  That could be used alongside physical notes and coins.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.000]  For now, till we phase them out,
[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  have you started any little tracker protests?
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.000]  Oh, where's my money gone?
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  The digital piggy bank is broken, I'm afraid.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  Start being a bit more cooperative.
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  Unlike most of the digital money people use daily today,
[05:13.000 --> 05:16.000]  it would be issued directly by a central bank,
[05:16.000 --> 05:18.000]  like the Bank of England in the UK.
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.000]  That's good, a central bank.
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000]  Nothing wrong with centralized authority,
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.000]  centralized power, globalist decrees coming down from on high,
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  avoiding democracy.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.000]  That's exactly what we want.
[05:28.000 --> 05:29.000]  Keep talking.
[05:29.000 --> 05:31.000]  Governments and central banks across the world
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  are working together.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  Oh, really? They're working together?
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  That's just such great news.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  The IMF, the World Bank.
[05:39.000 --> 05:41.000]  Why do we involve the WEF and the WHO?
[05:41.000 --> 05:45.000]  What we need are unelected global bodies
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  that have been able to co-opt political power,
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  respond to financial power,
[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000]  and ignore and oppress ordinary people.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  Whether it's the recent medical emergency
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  or the cost of living crisis,
[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000]  we're seeing the benefits all around us.
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  I can't wait for your next policy.
[05:59.000 --> 06:01.000]  You're going to take our money now. This is great.
[06:01.000 --> 06:03.000]  Looking into what having a digital currency
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.000]  might mean in practice.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  I think I know what it means in practice.
[06:07.000 --> 06:09.000]  More power for you, no power for us.
[06:09.000 --> 06:11.000]  This includes issues that people care about,
[06:11.000 --> 06:15.000]  such as ensuring users' money would be safe and secure,
[06:15.000 --> 06:17.000]  that it could work with other ways to pay,
[06:17.000 --> 06:18.000]  would be energy efficient.
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  It's going to be energy efficient.
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.000]  I was about to say, is it energy efficient?
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.000]  Is it energy efficient?
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  I've got to make sure.
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  A few other questions.
[06:27.000 --> 06:30.000]  You wouldn't use this ever would you to implement control
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  or to advance social credit type systems
[06:33.000 --> 06:36.000]  or to shut down the bank accounts of people you disagree with
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.000]  or to surveil people and have a surveillance network
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  that you've developed in conjunction with Big Tech
[06:41.000 --> 06:43.000]  and now a financial arm that you're developing
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  so that you can lock, step together,
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  and gridlock us in a digital prison of surveillance tyranny.
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  That's just off the top of my...
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  And of course, the new public prime minister says,
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  I am at World Bank, but no.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  Russell Brown says, oh, are we going to have the WEF involved?
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  No, the WEF and Bill Gates have given the money to it
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  to create the new digital world ID.
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  It's not coming, it's here.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  Here's a very powerful report just premiered
[07:11.000 --> 07:13.000]  at Band-Aid video,
[07:13.000 --> 07:25.000]  Bolsonaro election fraud in the big red wave from Gregory's.
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  Before his first election,
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  the radical opposition attempted to assassinate Jair Bolsonaro.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  Jair Bolsonaro has been left
[07:34.000 --> 07:36.000]  in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  This after being stabbed
[07:38.000 --> 07:41.000]  while drumming up support ahead of next month's vote.
[07:41.000 --> 07:44.000]  Hospital officials say it could take two months
[07:44.000 --> 07:46.000]  for him to recover.
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  They failed, and President Bolsonaro went on to become
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  today's leading model of what a world leader should be,
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  a man of the people.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  He spoke out against the COVID pandemic hoax
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.000]  from the very beginning.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  Brazil's right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  said he will not take a coronavirus vaccine
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  calling it his, quote, right.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  He made statements live on social media Thursday,
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  adding that Congress was not likely to require
[08:13.000 --> 08:15.000]  Brazilians to take a vaccine.
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  He thanked the farmers of Brazil for not shutting down
[08:19.000 --> 08:33.000]  and declared every single Brazilian as being essential.
[08:33.000 --> 08:50.000]  And now the world is realizing that Bolsonaro was right.
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  No matter how much the media tries to smear him,
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  the people of Brazil love him.
[08:55.000 --> 09:16.000]  The awakening masses in Brazil,
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  like everywhere else in the world today,
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  were expecting election fraud.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  Paul showed Bolsonaro still trailing behind left-wing
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  former leader, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.000]  Paul's are lying.
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  If Lula is really the frontrunner, where is he?
[09:33.000 --> 09:34.000]  Where are his crowds?
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  We are here to show that Bolsonaro represents the majority.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  He will only lose the election if there is fraud,
[09:40.000 --> 09:42.000]  and the people will take to the streets
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  to stop that from happening.
[09:43.000 --> 09:45.000]  And they have taken to the streets.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  All over Brazil, the people are not willing
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  to go the way of Joe Obama.
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.000]  The way of the World Economic Forum.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  What will it take for the people to be represented?
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  And what will America do if the anticipated red wave is stolen?
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  The President's office may have conceded a defeat,
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  but many of Jair Bolsonaro's millions of supporters have not.
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.000]  They took to the streets of São Paulo in their thousands.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  The national flag waved above the crowds
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  as they gathered outside the headquarters
[10:20.000 --> 10:23.000]  of the military's southeastern command.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  They're calling for an intervention.
[10:25.000 --> 10:30.000]  Put simply, they want a military coup.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  They despise the leftist policies of Lula da Silva,
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  and they want him out by any means.
[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  I think the red wave that's coming
[10:40.000 --> 10:42.000]  is going to be like the elevator doors
[10:42.000 --> 10:49.000]  opening up in the shining.
[10:49.000 --> 10:55.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Reese.
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  We are now only 63 hours out from the midterms.
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  We'll be here covering it all live.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, globalist art, a complete satanic joke.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  All right, we're going to go to break.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  We're going to come back.
[11:12.000 --> 11:14.000]  Dr. Peter McCall is ready to get in here
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  and be in the studio for two hours.
[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  They do not want you to hear this.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  This man is vindicated.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  They're trying to strip his medical licenses.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  He's going to expose the crowds against humanity,
[11:23.000 --> 11:25.000]  and he told me the gloves are off.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  He's going to tell you everything he knows.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  So that's coming up here in just a moment.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  Please don't forget, we've launched the biggest sale of the year.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  Things build in October and in November.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  They always peak in November with our Black Friday comes early.
[11:39.000 --> 11:40.000]  But a lot of stuff will sell out.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  So the products are basically all in.
[11:42.000 --> 11:43.000]  Most of them are still there.
[11:43.000 --> 11:45.000]  X3 is about to sell out.
[11:45.000 --> 11:49.000]  And you'll be able to get up to 60% off the promo code 1776
[11:49.000 --> 11:50.000]  until the stuff sells out.
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  We need the war chest to fund ourselves.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  Plus, these are amazing products you need.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  X3, Vita Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus,
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus,
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  the double fizzy magnesium product.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  All of it at infowarstore.com.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  I want to thank you for your past support.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  This is the fight. We're in the fight.
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  And we wouldn't be here without you.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  Plus, these are great products you need.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  So we're going to go to Dr. Peter McCullough,
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  then I'm going to come back with an Alan Watt interview.
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  A listener pointed this out on Friday.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  This interview 12 years ago,
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.000]  a group of interviews for a film that never got made.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  He died a few years ago.
[12:32.000 --> 12:35.000]  But talk about a Gen 21, Gen 2030,
[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  the whole New World Order.
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.000]  This guy was as smart as myself or David Iker
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  or anybody who may be smarter.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  So the full two-plus hour interview
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  is on Band-Aid video right now.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  We had it reposted on the Saturday.
[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  Alan Watt, they got that you're programming.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  But 30-minute excerpt of that is coming up at the end today.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.000]  So please stay with us. We'll be right back.
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  I'm pointing my finger at you.
[13:01.000 --> 13:03.000]  And I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[13:05.000 --> 13:07.000]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[13:07.000 --> 13:09.000]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  You forget to take DX3.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  And you know it makes your life better.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  And you know it makes you healthier.
[13:16.000 --> 13:17.000]  And you constantly forget.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  And when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  This stuff will blow you away.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  Plus it funds our operation.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  We have the biggest settle that you're going right now

[13:52.000 --> 14:02.000]  This is infowarstore.com.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  It was the best of times.
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  It was the worst of times.
[14:26.000 --> 14:27.000]  A tale of two cities.
[14:27.000 --> 14:31.000]  Dr. Peter McCullough is totally, absolutely vindicated
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  in his work in the last two and a half plus years
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  questioning where the virus came from
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  and then pointing out the dangers
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  of the so-called experimental vaccines.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.000]  Because he's been, probably, arguably,
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  the most effective, accurate, truthful person
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  all over Fox News, all over international media,
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  all over talk radio, topping the charts
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  on some of the biggest podcasts in history with Joe Rogan.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  He is being targeted to have his medical credential stripped.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  And they even had to change the rules to try to do this.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  This is outrageous.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  At the same time, we have the deep state
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  through their mouthpiece, The Atlantic, coming on on Monday,
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.000]  saying, let's declare a pandemic amnesty.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  And saying, we made mistakes. We're sorry. We're wrong.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  No, basically, they lied at every front.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  In fact, there was an article came out on Friday
[15:20.000 --> 15:25.000]  that the DHS already had a whole plan
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  for a pandemic and lockdowns, and the entire operation,
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  years before Trump even got into office,
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  and it was developed by John Hopkins,
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  by Bill and Linda Gates, and by the UN.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  So this is all a strategic operation.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  They're preparing to try to roll it out again.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  We also had the big news break last week
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.000]  in the intercept that under Obama,
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  and then under Trump, but it was kept from him,
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  and then under Biden, DHS,
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  coordinating with Democrat Party think tanks
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  and private groups with government orders,
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  illegally telling big tech what to censor,
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  and paramount was people like Dr. Peter McCullough
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  and others, not just election fraud,
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  not just open borders, but lockdowns
[16:09.000 --> 16:12.000]  and forced injections, and the Afghan withdrawal.
[16:12.000 --> 16:15.000]  So this is the government directly colluding with big tech
[16:15.000 --> 16:18.000]  and private think tanks to censor the American people,
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  and Dr. Peter McCullough is taking the gloves off now.
[16:20.000 --> 16:22.000]  He knows exactly what he's being targeted with.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  He's going to roll through it all with us
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.000]  in this extended commercial-free transmission
[16:27.000 --> 16:28.000]  with him in studio with us.
[16:28.000 --> 16:30.000]  Dr., thank you so much for being here.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  Alex, thanks for having me. The gloves are off.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  And I can tell you, America should be outraged
[16:38.000 --> 16:41.000]  with the developments we've seen over the last few weeks,
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  certainly over the last few months.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  The mind-blowing reality that the U.S. government,
[16:47.000 --> 16:50.000]  multiple agencies working internationally
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.000]  with global agencies are conducting operations
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  against their own people. It's astonishing.
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  And we have a situation now where it's all in the open.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  Authors have captured this.
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  Peter Bragan, COVID-19, the global predators,
[17:07.000 --> 17:08.000]  he had captured this.
[17:08.000 --> 17:11.000]  Scott Atlas and his book about the White House
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  are part of it. Pam Popper, a whole variety.
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  John Leake and myself encouraged to face COVID-19.
[17:17.000 --> 17:20.000]  There is a biopharmaceutical complex,
[17:20.000 --> 17:26.000]  which is a complex syndicate that is working together
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  in order to conduct an operation worldwide on people.
[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  And what's central to it, Alex, is mass vaccination.
[17:33.000 --> 17:37.000]  We talked a lot before we began taping this special Saturday broadcast.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  So just please repeat what you were telling me
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  and start at the beginning and walk through
[17:41.000 --> 17:42.000]  wherever you'd like to begin.
[17:42.000 --> 17:45.000]  The attack on you, the so-called request,
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.000]  declare an amnesty, and what they're planning next.
[17:49.000 --> 17:54.000]  Dr. Emily Oster from Brown University in the Atlantic
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  put out an essay, and the title of it is
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  Let's Declare a Pandemic Amnesty.
[18:00.000 --> 18:02.000]  Not let's consider it, let's declare it.
[18:02.000 --> 18:04.000]  So let's get the words right here.
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  When there is wrongdoing by those in positions of authority,
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  that's called malfeasance.
[18:10.000 --> 18:14.000]  And the wrongdoing that we can point clear examples
[18:14.000 --> 18:20.000]  that have occurred, obvious examples, irrefutable examples,
[18:20.000 --> 18:27.000]  led to lockdowns, loss of business, people losing their jobs,
[18:27.000 --> 18:34.000]  careers being ended, isolation, schools being disrupted,
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  educational development of children, permanently impaired,
[18:39.000 --> 18:44.000]  hospitalization and death that was avoidable.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  These are collectively crimes against humanity.
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  And when there is such massive wrongdoing,
[18:53.000 --> 18:57.000]  the steps would be actually repenting,
[18:57.000 --> 19:00.000]  having regret for what's being done,
[19:00.000 --> 19:03.000]  some admission for what's being done,
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.000]  seeking forgiveness and then ultimately amnesty.
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000]  Because the crimes are so great and the injuries are so vast,
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  there must be investigation, there must be justice that is served,
[19:18.000 --> 19:21.000]  and then at the very end of the day,
[19:21.000 --> 19:23.000]  considerations for amnesty.
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  We had some great monologues this week on this.
[19:26.000 --> 19:30.000]  One is by Laura Ingram on the Ingram Angle Fox News.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  And so let's go ahead and play a few minutes of that 18-minute report.
[19:33.000 --> 19:37.000]  You can find it on Rumble on Dr. Peter McCullough's account.
[19:37.000 --> 19:38.000]  We'll watch the whole thing.
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.000]  Here's a few minutes of what she said about this show called amnesty.
[19:42.000 --> 19:43.000]  No amnesty.
[19:43.000 --> 19:48.000]  That's the focus of tonight's angle.
[19:48.000 --> 19:49.000]  All right, how convenient.
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  Now that we see just how wrong the COVID experts were
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.000]  on everything from school shutdowns to vax mandates,
[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  those same experts are telling us that it's just time to move on.
[20:00.000 --> 20:01.000]  Move on.
[20:01.000 --> 20:03.000]  Nothing to see here.
[20:03.000 --> 20:06.000]  Please disperse.
[20:06.000 --> 20:08.000]  Nothing to see here.
[20:08.000 --> 20:09.000]  Please.
[20:09.000 --> 20:13.000]  Writing in The Atlantic, Brown University economist Emily Oster
[20:13.000 --> 20:17.000]  argues that we need to let bygones be bygones on the COVID debate
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  and not relitigate the past.
[20:19.000 --> 20:23.000]  We have to put these fights aside and declare a pandemic amnesty,
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  forgiving the hard calls that people had no choice but to make
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  with imperfect knowledge.
[20:28.000 --> 20:31.000]  LA County closed its beaches in the summer of 2020.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  Now ex post facto, this makes no sense,
[20:34.000 --> 20:39.000]  but we need to learn from our mistakes and then let them go.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  Nice try, but no way.
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  First off, there is little sign that those responsible
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  for the disastrous decisions actually learn much, if anything at all.
[20:49.000 --> 20:53.000]  Where were the maya culpas from the shutdown fanatics like Anthony Fauci
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  and Deborah Birx?
[20:55.000 --> 20:58.000]  First, they gave horrendous advice to Donald Trump that led to his
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  decision to shut down the entire country.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  This never should have happened.
[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  It did enormous damage to our children, our economy,
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  our constitutional rights, and the American psyche that we're still
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  seeing play out today.
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  Almost everything they advocated, other than maybe washing your
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.000]  hands and covering your face when you sneeze, was wrong, like this.
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  If you're never more than, if you're never within six feet
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  of any single individual, then you've controlled the virus.
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  We're asking the young people to help us with this mitigation
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.000]  strategy by staying out of the bars, staying out of the restaurants,
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  really trying to distance yourself.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  Don't get the attitude, well, I'm young, I'm invulnerable.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  Do you realize that social distancing was never grounded in
[21:47.000 --> 21:48.000]  science?
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.000]  Never.
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  It was all made up.
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  Single-costliest recommendation that CDC made that you had to
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  maintain six feet of distance that wasn't based on good judgment
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  and good science.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  They were wrong about the vaccine stopping transmission, too.
[22:05.000 --> 22:11.000]  Our data from the CDCs today suggest, you know, that vaccinated
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  people do not carry the virus, don't get sick.
[22:16.000 --> 22:17.000]  Whoops, false.
[22:17.000 --> 22:20.000]  Most Americans thought the vaccine would stop you from getting
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  COVID altogether.
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  Well, of course, we know that was wrong.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  You also could transmit the virus if you had the vaccine.
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  The CDC director Walensky has been vaxxed and boosted, I think,
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  a total of what, five times?
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  And she has COVID again.
[22:37.000 --> 22:40.000]  They were wrong to dismiss natural immunity as well.
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  It turns out acquired immunity through previous infection does
[22:44.000 --> 22:48.000]  in fact provide durable immunity from future infection, and it
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  certainly lessens your symptoms if you get it again.
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  And do you remember what CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta on the rest of
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  the medical cartel had Americans doing?
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  We do know the virus can live on surfaces, for example,
[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  stealing plastic for up to three days.
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  I've used a little glitter here for my kids to show you what
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  the virus might be like.
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  I'm just going to clean all the virus off here.
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  I don't need to do too much.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  It's a pretty sensitive virus.
[23:14.000 --> 23:17.000]  You don't need to use any kind of specific wipe either.
[23:17.000 --> 23:20.000]  Any household cleaner will do.
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  OK, I forgot that one.
[23:22.000 --> 23:25.000]  A few weeks later, CNN had to explain that, no,
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.000]  you don't actually need to wipe down your box of spaghetti or leave
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  your Amazon packages in the garage.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  How embarrassing.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  But these people were drunk on their own power.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  Anthony Fauci even wanted to control your holiday plans.
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  If you get vaccinated and your family's vaccinated,
[23:44.000 --> 23:49.000]  you can feel good about enjoying a typical Thanksgiving
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  Christmas with your family and close friends.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  You've got to be careful when you go into large public indoor
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  spaces where there are a lot of people there.
[23:58.000 --> 24:01.000]  And that's the reason why you should be wearing a mask under
[24:01.000 --> 24:02.000]  those circumstances.
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  I mean, obvious the N95 is the best.
[24:05.000 --> 24:10.000]  But as regular surgical mask as well as a cloth mask is fine.
[24:10.000 --> 24:11.000]  Wait a second.
[24:11.000 --> 24:12.000]  It's fine.
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  Is he talking about those filthy masks hanging on everyone's
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  rear view mirrors, the mask that they grabbed before they
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  dashed into a store?
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  Perhaps the worst part of all of this was the vicious campaign
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  to smear and deplatform anyone who questioned their
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  pronouncements, including world-renowned doctors and
[24:31.000 --> 24:32.000]  researchers.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  Remember the Great Barrington Declaration.
[24:34.000 --> 24:38.000]  The top academic institutions, they even blacklisted people.
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  These people have been threatened and excommunicated by
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  medical associations and, of course, social media platforms.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  And despite how wrong the so-called experts were on a
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  myriad issues, the retribution against dissident doctors
[24:52.000 --> 24:55.000]  continues to this day in the name of protecting public health
[24:55.000 --> 24:59.000]  and combating the spread of dangerous disinformation.
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  How ironic, since they're the worst purveyors of it at all.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  Fame cardiologist, a member of my medicine cabinet, Peter
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  McCullough, could even lose his board certification for what
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  he said over the last two-plus years.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  He told MedPage that he's appealing the recommendation
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  by the American Board of Internal Medicine, and he's
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  persecuted for stating the truth that the government was
[25:23.000 --> 25:27.000]  playing with math on the virus's true lethality.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  That was another issue of his.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  Well, now we see that he and others who spoke about the
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  lethality of the virus were right.
[25:35.000 --> 25:39.000]  A new analysis of COVID deaths shows that early on, before
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  vaccines were available, the infection fatality rate for
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  people younger than the age of 70 was below 1%.
[25:47.000 --> 25:56.000]  And for those under the age of 19, it was.0003%.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  Now, given the analysis we just read, it's less lethal
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  than the flu to a majority of the population.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  That is stunning.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  So-called public health officials duped America.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  All right, Doc.
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  So you wanted to play that.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  I'm glad we played that.
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  And quite frankly, Loringham does a great job.
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  It's a lot of courage.
[26:16.000 --> 26:19.000]  But the example she used are nothing compared to sending
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.000]  people sick with COVID into nursing homes and putting them
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  on ventilators, but then not letting families go see
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  their loved ones.
[26:26.000 --> 26:30.000]  And just, you know, all the other lies that we were told,
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  it's just staggering.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  Or if you have the shot, you can't spread COVID.
[26:34.000 --> 26:38.000]  I mean, it's just, but then everything you said has been
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  proven right.
[26:39.000 --> 26:40.000]  So that's why you're being targeted.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  So it's like they gave Obama who launched all these wars
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  a peace prize.
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  So it turns the Nobel peace prize into a joke.
[26:47.000 --> 26:50.000]  So instead of getting a peace prize now, when these guys
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  come after you, that's like winning the Oscar because
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  that shows that you're the good guy.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  I mean, this is a joke.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  I mean, I know it's hard to have them saying you're bad
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  coming after you try to take your license, but they want
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  amnesty for all their lies and corruption and debt they've
[27:04.000 --> 27:07.000]  caused, but then they're still trying to target people that
[27:07.000 --> 27:08.000]  force the truth out.
[27:08.000 --> 27:09.000]  You won.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  We won.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  People now know almost no one's taking these dangerous
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  shots.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  And so now they want to retroactively come back and
[27:15.000 --> 27:16.000]  quietly punish doctors.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  So other doctors in the future, when they try it again,
[27:19.000 --> 27:20.000]  don't speak up.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  Well, let's pick a couple of examples, Alex, even before
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.000]  the vaccines.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  First one, Remdesivir, the intravenous polymerase inhibitor.
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  By November of 2020, the World Health Organization declares
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  do not use Remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  because it doesn't reduce mortality and it causes
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  complications like kidney damage and liver damage.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  This is an obvious example.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  So when our Department of Health and Human Services and
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  Center for Medicare Medicaid Services gives enhanced
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  reimbursement to American hospitals to encourage the use
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.000]  of Remdesivir, when it shouldn't be used is a clear
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  example.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  The World Health Organization followed up with an analysis
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  in May of 2022 in the Lancet and confirmed they were right
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  back in November of 2020.
[28:09.000 --> 28:12.000]  Remdesivir should have never been used.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  That is a clear cut example.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  I'll give you another one.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  October 4th, 2020, as Laura Ingram points out, the Great
[28:19.000 --> 28:23.000]  Barrington Declaration is published by Jay Bhattachar
[28:23.000 --> 28:27.000]  from Stanford, Martin Kaldor from Harvard, Sinitia Gupta
[28:27.000 --> 28:28.000]  from Oxford.
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  It's signed by nearly a million scientists and people in my
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  circles saying that we should only take special protective
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  measures for our seniors and high-risk individuals.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  The rest of society go on normally, no lockdowns, no
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  changes with schools, no changes.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  And that's staggering.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  So a million doctors and scientists and health care
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  providers go and do this, it's totally ignored.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  And then now they're trying to take your license for joining
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  a million people with the truth.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  In fact, not only was it ignored, but later on, Naya,
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  director Anthony Fauci directly attacks Jay Bhattachara,
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.000]  who's a frequent contributor on Fox News as I am, for
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  crafting the Great Barrington Declaration.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  And you're right, now there's the hunting of doctors who have
[29:13.000 --> 29:16.000]  come out and tried to help their patients directly in their
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  practices by treating patients and also bringing America the
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  truth.
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.000]  What happened for me was the American Board of Internal
[29:24.000 --> 29:32.000]  Medicine, which is only role is to certify and credit my
[29:32.000 --> 29:34.000]  residency and fellowship training.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  So I completed residency for three years in medicine and
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.000]  three years cardiology fellowship.
[29:39.000 --> 29:42.000]  They are a standard by which they indicate that I've
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.000]  completed the criteria and that I have passed examinations for
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  internal medicine.
[29:48.000 --> 29:52.000]  I've passed four life and career determining internal
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  medicine examinations.
[29:53.000 --> 29:56.000]  So how do they then punish you by going back decades to pull
[29:56.000 --> 29:57.000]  tests you passed?
[29:57.000 --> 29:59.000]  That's like saying we're going to pull your college degree.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  No, listen, I've passed, listen, I met all the clinical
[30:01.000 --> 30:05.000]  criteria for internal medicine, four sets of exams through
[30:05.000 --> 30:09.000]  four decades now of practice and cardiology, three sets of
[30:09.000 --> 30:10.000]  exams.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  So my clinical track record is perfect.
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  The ABIM.
[30:13.000 --> 30:15.000]  That's like taking somebody's driver's license when they
[30:15.000 --> 30:16.000]  have a perfect driving record.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  Right.
[30:17.000 --> 30:22.000]  So anyhow, so I have the clinical, complete clinical dossier
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  as a highly qualified doctor.
[30:24.000 --> 30:25.000]  It's untouchable.
[30:25.000 --> 30:31.000]  What the ABIM does, Alex, in September of 2021, they declare
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  that they are going to have a COVID misinformation campaign
[30:35.000 --> 30:36.000]  that they announced.
[30:36.000 --> 30:39.000]  They never define what information or misinformation is.
[30:39.000 --> 30:41.000]  They don't offer any teaching modules.
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.000]  And that's run by the secret DHS Disinformation Governance
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  Board that it says specifically intercept this week targets
[30:48.000 --> 30:51.000]  doctors that question the official narrative.
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.000]  Right here, ladies and gentlemen.
[30:52.000 --> 30:55.000]  Almost certainly these government agencies directly
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  started to work with the Federation of State Medical
[30:57.000 --> 31:00.000]  Boards, the various accrediting bodies like the American
[31:00.000 --> 31:02.000]  Board of Internal Medicine.
[31:02.000 --> 31:03.000]  But listen to this, Alex.
[31:03.000 --> 31:06.000]  And so in September, they declare this campaign without
[31:06.000 --> 31:09.000]  giving doctors any type of guidance of what they can do
[31:09.000 --> 31:10.000]  or can't do.
[31:10.000 --> 31:15.000]  Then for me, they go back in time ex post facto to March
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.000]  of 2021 in my Senate testimony in the Texas Senate, where
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  under oath, I'm giving my best estimates of what is going on
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.000]  in the pandemic.
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  I'm using standard CDC equations.
[31:27.000 --> 31:30.000]  I'm answering questions for the Committee on Health
[31:30.000 --> 31:31.000]  and Human Services.
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  And they take statements that I've made in the Texas Senate
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  and they declare them misinformation.
[31:37.000 --> 31:42.000]  They put a letter out to me in May of 2022 saying this,
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  among other things, we have declared as misinformation.
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  They give me a chance to respond.
[31:47.000 --> 31:50.000]  I generate a tremendous response document as Americans
[31:50.000 --> 31:52.000]  have grown to know me.
[31:52.000 --> 31:54.000]  I cite every single piece of information.
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  I do not free will or guess on anything.
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  Everything is completely factual.
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  I give this response letter back to the American Board
[32:01.000 --> 32:02.000]  of Internal Medicine.
[32:02.000 --> 32:07.000]  I just received a letter October 19, 2022 stating,
[32:07.000 --> 32:10.000]  we don't think anything you said, Dr. McCullough,
[32:10.000 --> 32:11.000]  is compelling.
[32:11.000 --> 32:14.000]  So therefore, we have convicted you of misinformation.
[32:14.000 --> 32:17.000]  We are recommending that your entire residency and fellowship
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.000]  are stripped.
[32:18.000 --> 32:21.000]  Your board certifications are stripped from you.
[32:21.000 --> 32:24.000]  Basically, essentially taking six years of my life away
[32:24.000 --> 32:25.000]  and leaving.
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  By the way, California is trying to pass a law under Newsom
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  that if their government board says something just info
[32:32.000 --> 32:34.000]  like vitamin D3 protects you a lot from viruses,
[32:34.000 --> 32:36.000]  you will be stripped as well.
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  So it doesn't matter what your real medical training says.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  If you don't follow the corporate announcement,
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  as a doctor, we're going to strip you.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  California AB 2098 has actually been signed into law by Gavin Newsom.
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.000]  It's not in effect yet until January of 2023.
[32:50.000 --> 32:53.000]  There, the California Medical Board, again,
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  declaring misinformation and information,
[32:56.000 --> 32:59.000]  but without giving any guidance of what it is,
[32:59.000 --> 33:01.000]  no teaching modules, no guidance.
[33:01.000 --> 33:03.000]  It's a magic wand.
[33:03.000 --> 33:06.000]  It's just whatever we say, but again,
[33:06.000 --> 33:08.000]  you're being punished for being accurate.
[33:08.000 --> 33:10.000]  I know you don't want to do a victory lap,
[33:10.000 --> 33:13.000]  but look at your record of what you wrote and what you said
[33:13.000 --> 33:15.000]  as a well-known doctor and also a guy that done a lot of
[33:15.000 --> 33:18.000]  clinical trials and run government research programs
[33:18.000 --> 33:20.000]  where you were right.
[33:20.000 --> 33:22.000]  If anything, I think you underestimated how bad the
[33:22.000 --> 33:23.000]  experimental shots were.
[33:23.000 --> 33:25.000]  If you were wrong in any way, it was underestimating how bad
[33:25.000 --> 33:27.000]  it was.
[33:27.000 --> 33:30.000]  Yeah, I held myself out as being a reasonable doctor
[33:30.000 --> 33:33.000]  in the exam room with patients.
[33:33.000 --> 33:37.000]  The same way I carry myself with patients in my practice
[33:37.000 --> 33:40.000]  is the way I carried myself before the public
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  through two sets of extensive U.S. Senate testimony,
[33:43.000 --> 33:47.000]  two sets of Texas Senate testimony, multiple other states,
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  innumerable high-level media interviews.
[33:51.000 --> 33:58.000]  And when I was wrong or learned new details about
[33:58.000 --> 34:03.000]  the pandemic, I quickly acknowledged it and updated
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  the information database.
[34:05.000 --> 34:06.000]  I'll give you an example.
[34:06.000 --> 34:07.000]  That's how science works. It's a process.
[34:07.000 --> 34:08.000]  Yes, I'll give you an example.
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.000]  I went to Joe Rogan's studio in December of 2022,
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  and this is before the Omicron outbreak,
[34:14.000 --> 34:15.000]  and I was convinced that natural...
[34:15.000 --> 34:16.000]  2021.
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  2021, right, thank you.
[34:18.000 --> 34:21.000]  That the natural immunity was holding out.
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  And it was like two days later, the news broke that,
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  actually, Omicron broke through the natural immunity.
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  I went on national TV that night, and I said,
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.000]  listen, this is an update.
[34:29.000 --> 34:30.000]  Watch out.
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  You really can get COVID multiple times.
[34:32.000 --> 34:33.000]  Omicron broke through.
[34:33.000 --> 34:36.000]  And quickly, you know, the Joe Rogan audience,
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  you know, were messaging me.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  They quickly said, okay, we understand.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  Dr. McCullough is fair and reasonable.
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  And that's how people have characterized me.
[34:44.000 --> 34:51.000]  This relentless pursuit of me as a public figure now,
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  who has basically, as a doctor and doctors in my circle,
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  worked to save as many lives as possible,
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  worked globally to bring truthful information forward
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  on the pandemic.
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  This is part of the overall government operation.
[35:09.000 --> 35:12.000]  And we talked before we went on air about,
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  you've done the deep dive, and so have we.
[35:14.000 --> 35:15.000]  It's on record.
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  DARPA is pushing the mRNA.
[35:17.000 --> 35:18.000]  It's not a vaccine.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  They're using Pfizer and Moderna as front groups,
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  even Gates as a front group.
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  I want to start getting into some of the mechanics of that
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  and where you see all this going,
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  because we can see them warming up for a new virus,
[35:29.000 --> 35:30.000]  a new push.
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  And as you said, this is a military weapon
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  being used against the people.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  To set the understanding here,
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  so the National Institutes of Health
[35:39.000 --> 35:43.000]  has had a longstanding interest in biological threats
[35:43.000 --> 35:46.000]  to populations, and the division dealing with this
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  is called BARDA.
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  I've chaired Data Safety and Monitoring Board
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  in the past four BARDA on a program,
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  so I'm very familiar with it.
[35:53.000 --> 35:57.000]  On the military side, the research organization is DARPA.
[35:57.000 --> 35:58.000]  DARPA.
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  And these two work in concert to identify
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  and work on biological threats and work on answers,
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  like vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, drugs,
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  other things that can be done,
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  largely to protect the military,
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  but there has been an interest in the public in large.
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  Now, on the DARPA website is a program
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  called the ADEPT-P3 program.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  The ADEPT-P3.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  ADEPT-P3 program on their website.
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.000]  And in that program,
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  for many years now, they have described
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  that DARPA is working with messenger RNA.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  And in one of their perspectives,
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  they actually, for the U.S. government,
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  they have a figure where they declare
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.000]  that they can use messenger RNA technology
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  to end a pandemic within 60 days.
[36:50.000 --> 36:56.000]  And this was sold to American military government leaders
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  that messenger RNA was going to be the future
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  to approach for many years.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  So this was long before we heard about Pfizer
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  and BioNTech and Moderna and Johnson Johnson AstraZeneca.
[37:08.000 --> 37:13.000]  The messenger RNA was actually part of government interests
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  from a military biological research perspective.
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  And I remember videos from 2017 with Fauci and others
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  on C-SPAN, they were saying,
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  we've got all this mRNA, it's going to cure everything,
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.000]  but we've got to blow up the old approval system
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  that takes 5, 10 years first,
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  and maybe a virus out of China will allow us to do that.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  That's a chilling video.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  You picked up an important point.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  So the key here was to have a global and national emergencies.
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  Emergencies, and note that our current President Biden
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  has extended this recently again, the never-ending emergency.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  As long as an emergency is declared,
[37:50.000 --> 37:54.000]  emergency use authorization and emergency countermeasures
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  are enabled. This is very important.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  Under emergency use authorization,
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  it's actually debatable whether or not
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  FDA approval is even needed in many ways.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  The FDA and their pronouncements on the vaccines
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  are theater, this largely theater.
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  Well, that was the report I saw Friday,
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  which, guys, I put in the commentary
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  and I forgot to get out of the big stack from Friday.
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  I didn't cover it. I remember the headline.
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  It was like linked to the Daily Mail.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  The headline was, National Security Council
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  had already developed a secret plan
[38:26.000 --> 38:30.000]  that was implemented for COVID and was in full control
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  under national emergency.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  The point is, we already know that.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  It's just what you're saying is, this was all pre-programmed and ready.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  It was pre-programmed and ready.
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  And when the vaccines rolled out,
[38:40.000 --> 38:43.000]  the very initial document that was presented to a public
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  was signed by Alex Azar,
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
[38:47.000 --> 38:51.000]  and the Department of Defense, HHS and DOD.
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.000]  So we really just need the Secretary of the Health and Human Services
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  to sign off on this. This is a necessary measure.
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  And then the military to go ahead and carry this out.
[39:01.000 --> 39:04.000]  On my podcast this weekend, playing today and tomorrow,
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  I interview Sasha Ladipova,
[39:07.000 --> 39:11.000]  who is a vaccine and pharmaceutical expert.
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  She's an investigative journalist now.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  And we do a deep dive into this, Alex.
[39:16.000 --> 39:20.000]  The vaccines are largely produced by military contractors.
[39:20.000 --> 39:23.000]  That Pfizer and Moderna and the other companies,
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  they're basically shields.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  There's some type of, like a figurehead, if you will, of what's going on.
[39:28.000 --> 39:31.000]  But importantly, the final fill and finish,
[39:31.000 --> 39:34.000]  that is pouring the vials of the vaccine.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  That's done by defense contractors.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  Under EUA, Alex, there's no inspection for safety, purity,
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  or for quality.
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  And now they're targeting six-month-olds and up,
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  only country in the world doing it.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  You have this 35,000-foot view,
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  back of this amnesty.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  We have another clip from Del Bigtree,
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  which is very important to get to.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  You don't speculate. You've just stuck to the facts.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  But privately, we've talked about this going back a year ago,
[40:02.000 --> 40:05.000]  and now, before we went on there today.
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  I mean, big picture. This is very cold-blooded.
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  They know these shots are hurting people.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  They're trying to cover it up,
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  and they're still trying to make our troops take it.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  Obviously, the average person in the military is a great person,
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  but when we talk about defense contractors,
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  this is just the biggest budget we have.
[40:20.000 --> 40:23.000]  It's a lot of special interests that are in control
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  of the Defense Department that are doing this.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  Obviously, they know what they're doing,
[40:27.000 --> 40:30.000]  hitting us with what I would call as a weapon.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  And then after we get back into them wanting amnesty,
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  you've got to play that clip.
[40:35.000 --> 40:39.000]  I want to talk about the motives for rolling something out
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  that hurts and kills as many people.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  How do they think they're getting away with it?
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  How could governments conduct operations
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  against their own people worldwide?
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  I see this fraction of response country by country.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  Americans know something is wrong.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  Let me give you some important data points.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  The Zogby Survey Company, a reliable survey company,
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  did a survey of Americans,
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.000]  found that two-thirds had taken a COVID vaccine.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  Of those, 15% have some new medical problem
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  that they're seeing a doctor for.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  85% are fine.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  Sashi Latapova on my podcast this weekend
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  with a color report indicates that those who are fine
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  probably have gotten relatively inert shots
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  of degraded messenger RNA or low concentration messenger RNA.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  Those who are injured are getting what's called hotlots.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  We know that 35% of the deaths with...
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  I'm sorry, 80% of the deaths with Pfizer
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  and 35% of the deaths with Moderna
[41:37.000 --> 41:40.000]  are within 20% of the lots.
[41:40.000 --> 41:45.000]  And Americans know from that perspective
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  that people are talking to other people.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  A survey from Michigan State,
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  Ditmore and colleagues, 22% of Americans
[41:52.000 --> 41:55.000]  know somebody who's been injured or died after a vaccine.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  So we don't need social media, Alex.
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  We don't need major media to broadcast as much
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  as people are talking to one another.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  If the camera will get on my screen right now,
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  I am on the CDC website, the COVID Data Tracker,
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  and notice on the right corner here, vaccinations.
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  What is the percent of individuals over age 5
[42:15.000 --> 42:18.000]  with an updated booster dose?
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  Answer, 8.4%.
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  These boosters, the bivalent boosters,
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  which are still 50% of the original legacy vaccine,
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  which is obsolete,
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.000]  and 50% of the Omicron BA4, BA5 subvariant,
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  the homologous epitope of those,
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.000]  that that vaccine had no human data.
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  There were no clinical trials.
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  It was tested in a small number of mice.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  It failed in stopping the infection,
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  and there was a false rise in the antibodies,
[42:50.000 --> 42:53.000]  a false surrogate, if you will.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  And so, importantly, that is, I think,
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  prima facie evidence that the FDA
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  actually doesn't need to approve these.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  They don't need to apply any standards.
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  It's also evidence that the FDA has no power
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  to pull these off the market
[43:07.000 --> 43:10.000]  or tell any of the companies through the DOD
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  and the manufacturers to pull these off this market.
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  Essentially, this is a freight train
[43:15.000 --> 43:17.000]  moving forward on the American people.
[43:17.000 --> 43:19.000]  The only thing that will stop this
[43:19.000 --> 43:21.000]  is people rejecting it,
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  and right now, we're at 92% of Americans
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  are rejecting any more vaccination.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  Let's talk about, there's so much to hit here,
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  but let's talk about real numbers.
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  Let's talk about insurance actuaries.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  We see a lot of other prominent doctors
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  coming out and saying we're seeing a lot of extra deaths,
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  these weird blood clots,
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  all sorts of autoimmune problems,
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  microcarditis, heart attacks.
[43:45.000 --> 43:48.000]  I mean, there's record-level deaths happening,
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  but the numbers you've seen
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  with the sudden death syndrome they're talking about,
[43:53.000 --> 43:55.000]  how do we quantify that?
[43:55.000 --> 43:57.000]  What's the real numbers there?
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.000]  Let's go to the openvares.com data overlay.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  It's on my screen right now.
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  Oh, you got it up.
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  This is not disputed.
[44:07.000 --> 44:11.000]  This is a weekly update of code
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  written against and equaries the CDC database.
[44:15.000 --> 44:19.000]  Now, VAERS includes domestic, U.S.,
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  and then some ex-U.S. sources
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  that get reported in through pharma,
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  and then go in here, including Japan and Germany.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  So the overall numbers, 31,696,
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  astronomical number of deaths,
[44:30.000 --> 44:33.000]  are American, so we toggle this button here at the top,
[44:33.000 --> 44:36.000]  toggle over, now there's American numbers.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  14,920 as of October 21st.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  These are deaths.
[44:43.000 --> 44:46.000]  Now, let's look at where they occur.
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  If we take 96 hours or at four days,
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  the vast majority of the deaths
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  occur within four days of people taking the shot.
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  We know from an analysis by McLaughlin and colleagues,
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  who's dying? Our seniors.
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  Our senior citizens are dying
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.000]  at an astronomical rate after taking the vaccines,
[45:06.000 --> 45:07.000]  and it's relatively silent.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  It's happening in our nursing homes,
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  happening in independent living.
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  It's not just statistics, we see it in the news.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  My mom took it, my dad took it,
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  my daughter took it, my husband took it,
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  my wife, and then they're dead in three, four days.
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  Absolutely. The same story over and over again.
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  And look at here, look at the number.
[45:22.000 --> 45:27.000]  70,633 Americans hospitalized
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  105,040 urgent care visits.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  We know from the ICANN data
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  that from the V-safe data,
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  you can pull this up if you can find it
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  on the ICANN ICANN website,
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  that's an NGO through legal action,
[45:44.000 --> 45:48.000]  lead attorney Aaron Seary prosecuted the CDC
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  and said we must see the V-safe data.
[45:50.000 --> 45:53.000]  V-safe is what people can report on their cell phones
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  after they take the vaccine and what happens to them.
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  The CDC wanted to block release
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  of this important source of data to Americans.
[46:02.000 --> 46:05.000]  Finally, Seary and ICANN get it and it's a bombshell.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  Actually, Aaron Seary went on Fox News that night
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.000]  when it broke a few weeks ago.
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  This is what we've learned, Alex.
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  25% of people who take the vaccine
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  are incapacitated the next day.
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  They can't go to work or school.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  7% to 8% of them are so sick
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  that they end up in the hospital or worse.
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  And I've seen, whether it's in the U.K. or here,
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  when they die of it, they call it a COVID.
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  Well, the attribution of death to the vaccine
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  has been a consistent problem.
[46:37.000 --> 46:39.000]  Let's talk about it.
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  Jessica Rose, a very, very well-respected epidemiologist,
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  estimates for death that the underreporting factor is about 31.
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  We know from a prior Harvard study in 2018
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  that it could be as much as 100-fold underreported.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  So think about 100-fold.
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.000]  That's 1.4 million people.
[46:59.000 --> 47:03.000]  31-fold underreported would be somewhere
[47:03.000 --> 47:07.000]  around 500,000 to 600,000 individuals.
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  Just in the U.S.?
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  Just in the U.S.
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  Now, the World Council for Health,
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  World Council for Health,
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  an international organization,
[47:16.000 --> 47:21.000]  an umbrella organization for about 70 individual organizations,
[47:21.000 --> 47:25.000]  June 11th of 2022,
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  issues of Pharmacovigilance Report.
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  Not only just on VAERS, but on the U.K. Yellow Card,
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  the EU UDRS system, and the WHO Vigisay system,
[47:35.000 --> 47:39.000]  and they declare vaccines are unfit for human use,
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  pull them off the market, they had stern warnings.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  I give credit to a French lab, actually, in March of 2021.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  They were the first ones to say, listen, in March,
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  pull these off the market.
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  I was on a paper with Bruno and colleagues,
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.000]  May of 2021, 57 authors, 17 countries,
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  where we declared, we put it to every single government
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  in the world, and we said, we have serious safety concerns.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  If this can't be rectified immediately,
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.000]  pull them off the market.
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  So I can tell you, Alex, we were, within a few months,
[48:09.000 --> 48:12.000]  as you pointed out, we were all neutral to the vaccines,
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  which we should be at first.
[48:14.000 --> 48:17.000]  But once things started to turn bad, looking backwards,
[48:17.000 --> 48:21.000]  knowing that Pfizer knew about 1,223 deaths
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  within 90 days of release of their vaccine,
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.000]  looking backwards, a responsible FDA in Pfizer
[48:27.000 --> 48:30.000]  should have pulled Pfizer off the market
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  before February 1st of 2021,
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  and Moderna and Johnson & Johnson never should have come out.
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  And now they've got a tiger by the tail,
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  so they're paradoxically trying to persecute you
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  and other Sherry, Tim, Penny, and others
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.000]  who are vindicated and don't want to be superstars,
[48:45.000 --> 48:48.000]  but are people realizing you were so dead on?
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  Separately going, give us amnesty.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  We're sorry we lied to you.
[48:52.000 --> 48:53.000]  We're sorry everything was fake.
[48:53.000 --> 48:56.000]  We're sorry the CDC's own document, October 2000,
[48:56.000 --> 48:57.000]  predicted all this.
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  It's another question, how did they know that?
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  The first people to do it was a government warning on it.
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.000]  I guess it was whistleblowers inside, maybe.
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  So what do you make of this paradox
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  where you're being persecuted even though you're vindicated,
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  the system's been caught lying at every level,
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  what does that quantify,
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  and what do you think they're going to do next?
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  Because I think it's fair to say maybe you disagree,
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  this has blown up in their face spectacularly,
[49:21.000 --> 49:24.000]  and it has woken up more people
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  across the political spectrum worldwide
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  than any issue ever, and it's not going away,
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.000]  and as we see continued shock waves from the shots
[49:33.000 --> 49:37.000]  and what's happening, they've got a tiger by the tail.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  Absolutely, I mean, look at the evidence
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  I've shared with you despite a massive two-year campaign
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.000]  of incessant ads, public health messaging,
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  complete censorship and distortion of social media
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  through Twitter and Facebook, press briefings,
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  corporate mandates, school mandates, military mandates.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  Look at the data on my screen.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  92% of Americans are saying no more.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  I mean, this is astonishing, it's blown up in their face.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  You know what's really happened too
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  is that the band-aid has been ripped off
[50:15.000 --> 50:18.000]  the entire vaccine agenda, Alex,
[50:18.000 --> 50:21.000]  and this is now doctors like myself are reexamining
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.000]  the whole rationale for when I was born,
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  there were three vaccines, three.
[50:27.000 --> 50:31.000]  A child today now faces something like 72 injections.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  Do you know that children at the day they're born
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  are given hepatitis B antigen vaccine
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  and one-year-olds are given influenza vaccine?
[50:39.000 --> 50:45.000]  People are starting to question this aggressive vaccination schedule,
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  actually vaccinating for easily treatable illnesses
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  like bacterial infections like diphtheria and pertussis.
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  People are starting to question the whole thing.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  I'm talking to more and more parents that say,
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  you know what, we've lost our trust in vaccines overall.
[50:58.000 --> 51:01.000]  Well, remember back in late 2019,
[51:01.000 --> 51:07.000]  they had an emergency meeting of the UN regulators in Switzerland.
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.000]  And it was like a two-day meeting, it was 16 hours,
[51:11.000 --> 51:14.000]  we watched it here, we had to plan about two hours of it on air.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  And they went down the whole row of scientists,
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  including the chief vaccine advisor,
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  and they said, look, even our own scientists and frontline doctors
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  don't want to give it anymore, we're giving too many,
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  we don't do any testing, these are quotes,
[51:24.000 --> 51:27.000]  we're given what Big Pharma tells us,
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  and that's being made by the Defense Department in the U.S.,
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  they even said that, and we just give it to people,
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  and then it hurts a bunch of people,
[51:35.000 --> 51:39.000]  and the villagers don't trust us, the rural populations,
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.000]  these urban populations, the educated populations,
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  we've got a crisis, and they went on to say,
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  we're about to see total confidence loss in the vaccine program,
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  which we believe done properly and executed correctly
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  for real threats is a real science.
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  They said, we've got us, and then boom, COVID comes in.
[51:55.000 --> 51:56.000]  I'm sure you've seen those clips,
[51:56.000 --> 51:59.000]  but even the UN zone head regulatory board
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  is hitting the panic button going,
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  and then boom, COVID comes in.
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  That's true, confidence was eroding.
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  Landmark year was 1986 when the vaccine injury
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  indemnification program came through for the manufacturers.
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  People were already starting to get concerns
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  that this whole vaccine agenda was getting out of control,
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  and there are rare side effects,
[52:21.000 --> 52:24.000]  but there was a trend, a growing trend at that time
[52:24.000 --> 52:27.000]  to understand that some neuropsychiatric syndromes,
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  such as Asperger's disease,
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  and others could be related
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  as an idiosyncratic reaction to vaccines.
[52:34.000 --> 52:37.000]  I remember famed Dr. Andrew Wakefield,
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  who came forward and brought this concern.
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  With any product, it's fair and reasonable to be concerned.
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  Doctors who come forward should not be crushed,
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.000]  and what's happened over time, this is before COVID.
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  The science is about questions.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  We're asking questions, but listen, this is about vaccines,
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  and the history of vaccines not being questioned
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  and not being allowed to have any discourse.
[53:01.000 --> 53:02.000]  This is before COVID.
[53:02.000 --> 53:06.000]  Dr. Paul Thomas in Oregon
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  starts to feel uncomfortable with how this whole vaccine agenda
[53:09.000 --> 53:12.000]  is rolling out over the decades,
[53:12.000 --> 53:15.000]  and he declares in his pediatric practice
[53:15.000 --> 53:18.000]  that the parents can decide what vaccines the children get,
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  as opposed to following this authoritative schedule.
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  And the Oregon Medical Board gets wind of this.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  They pull his license.
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  They said, you can't practice.
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  He goes, listen, I'm giving people freedom of choice.
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  You know what Paul did in the time
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  where he was basically out of medicine?
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  He commissioned a study of his patients,
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  half of whom took all the vaccines,
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  half of them didn't,
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  and the ones who didn't take the vaccines to the children,
[53:42.000 --> 53:43.000]  they were healthier.
[53:43.000 --> 53:47.000]  They had lower rates of all types of disorders,
[53:47.000 --> 53:51.000]  asthma, urticaria, various forms of hay fever,
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.000]  asperger's and other neuropsychiatry.
[53:54.000 --> 53:57.000]  It's definitely linked to allergies increasing.
[53:57.000 --> 54:00.000]  The Thomas data, I think, are very compelling.
[54:00.000 --> 54:05.000]  It's one of the few controlled data sets that we can look at.
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  The vaccines have rolled out,
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  and this has been a big issue with the ICANN group
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  led by Dell Big Tree and others,
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  is that vaccines have come out unquestioned
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  without adequate randomized possible controlled trials.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  And there's just been an assumption
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  that they're safe and effective.
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.000]  And so as a layperson, what I see is this,
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  you've got the military industrial complex,
[54:25.000 --> 54:26.000]  people getting rich off of it,
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  big pharma, the politicians,
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  people that want a magic bullet, the general public,
[54:30.000 --> 54:33.000]  you know, take any drug that they put on the market,
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  and we've seen the carnage is caused by that.
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  And now, as the opposition mounted,
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  they said, let's give them the miracle mRNA,
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  and let's show them how magic it is,
[54:43.000 --> 54:46.000]  and let's forget all the attacks
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  that we did previously with this great miracle
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  that'll make everybody love us,
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  and then it's 10 times worse.
[54:51.000 --> 54:56.000]  That, I think, is the shmuckish view,
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  because I get the average person
[54:58.000 --> 54:59.000]  that works the medical system,
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  cares and loves people so they can't believe
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  there's other evil people above them.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  But if we know, and it's so many of the 20 years,
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  the trials they've done with mRNA,
[55:07.000 --> 55:08.000]  that it works a lot of the time,
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  but part of the time kills you, or mames you,
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  or liquefies your liver,
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  then they obviously weren't stupid
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  and had done my studies and others,
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  and knew this was gonna have some big, big problems.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  And so, you're smart, I'm smart.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  Obviously, the folks that run things aren't stupid.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  Doctor, do you think they were just mistaken?
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  Or at a higher level, is there some organized evil here?
[55:29.000 --> 55:33.000]  There is a continued love affair
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  in pursuit of messenger RNA.
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  Now, messenger RNA, remember, is the genetic code
[55:38.000 --> 55:41.000]  for part of a virus or an organism.
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  It has nucleoside analog caps at the 3 prime and 5 prime.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  It means they're indestructible.
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  The paper from Stanford by Rulkin and colleagues has proven.
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  You can spray them on people.
[55:52.000 --> 55:53.000]  It's indestructible.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  Remember the Pentagon report they wanted to do with China?
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  They wanted to spray the caves with it.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  Yeah, the body doesn't break this stuff down.
[55:59.000 --> 56:00.000]  This stuff is indestructible,
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  so every shot is permanent in human body now.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  We have very good understanding.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  But can't it be aerosols too?
[56:06.000 --> 56:07.000]  There are attempts to do this.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  I'm not an expert in all the routes of administration,
[56:09.000 --> 56:14.000]  but a review paper that's summarized in my sub-stack this morning
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  has indicated that, you know, the history of this is not good.
[56:17.000 --> 56:20.000]  Messenger RNA vaccine for HIV completely failed,
[56:20.000 --> 56:24.000]  caused way too much inflammation inside effects.
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  Now we had COVID-19 vaccines.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  It's just been a disaster.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  And guess what's coming?
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  MNRA vaccines for influenza.
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  And both Pfizer and Pfizer-Moderna have announced these,
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  and it's going to be combined with the bivalent COVID booster,
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  and we're going to talk about this in more detail.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  I think let's hear a record that's going to interrupt you.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  I just saw it two days ago.
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  They've gone, hey, since there's no approval anymore,
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  we've got a new thing we're rolling out.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  So it's like the door's blown open.
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  Pandora's box is open.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  And they just go, now you'll have a higher uptake.
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  We're going to mix the new manipulation of mRNA
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  for COVID with the influenza.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  So tell us how many.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  You got that.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  So as long as the COVID is under emergency use authorization,
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.720]  And now there's a congenar of the COVID-19
[57:13.720 --> 57:17.520]  bivalent vaccine and a messenger RNA influenza vaccine.
[57:17.520 --> 57:20.280]  I imagine that Pfizer-Moderna are gonna attempt
[57:20.280 --> 57:22.480]  to get this in under the EUA umbrella.
[57:22.480 --> 57:23.320]  So they can-
[57:23.320 --> 57:26.440]  So it's a loophole for their influenza, their cancer,
[57:26.440 --> 57:28.040]  their anything.
[57:28.040 --> 57:29.640]  As long as they add COVID,
[57:29.640 --> 57:31.120]  oh, we have emergency authorization.
[57:31.120 --> 57:34.720]  Well, if it, Alex, for a new genetic product,
[57:34.720 --> 57:39.200]  it needs five years of development observation, five years.
[57:39.200 --> 57:41.120]  They're talking about trying to put these together
[57:41.120 --> 57:42.120]  in a few months.
[57:42.120 --> 57:45.080]  NTD News had Professor David Weismanon,
[57:45.080 --> 57:49.480]  former J&J scientist, actually won many awards there.
[57:49.480 --> 57:52.920]  He made it clear this is going to be a complete disaster
[57:52.920 --> 57:55.040]  because side effects are gonna be amplified.
[57:55.040 --> 57:57.360]  Now we're installing the genetic code,
[57:57.360 --> 58:01.400]  not only for the COVID-19 lethal spike protein,
[58:01.400 --> 58:04.760]  but also dangerous parts of the influenza antigens.
[58:04.760 --> 58:06.920]  And people are gonna get very sick,
[58:06.920 --> 58:09.760]  produce many abnormal proteins in the human body
[58:09.760 --> 58:12.520]  with no control over the duration or quantity.
[58:12.520 --> 58:15.320]  And our proteins, abnormal proteins associated with
[58:16.440 --> 58:18.440]  spongiform encephalopathy type diseases?
[58:18.440 --> 58:19.280]  Well, absolutely.
[58:19.280 --> 58:22.280]  We know that abnormal proteins can fold,
[58:22.280 --> 58:26.840]  so they can become a prion-like and cause mad cow,
[58:26.840 --> 58:30.720]  various forms of spongiform encephalopathy in theory.
[58:30.720 --> 58:33.400]  We also know that the amylogenic, the spike protein,
[58:33.400 --> 58:35.880]  recent paper I've published with Stephanie Sanoff
[58:35.880 --> 58:38.160]  has clearly shown this, that they're amylogenic,
[58:38.160 --> 58:41.040]  meaning they're rubbery, Alex, amyloid.
[58:41.040 --> 58:44.760]  Think about amyloid as a rubbery, biologic substance.
[58:44.760 --> 58:48.280]  No surprise now, the spike protein has been found
[58:48.280 --> 58:52.040]  within blood clots of people who've taken the vaccine,
[58:52.040 --> 58:54.760]  and the morticians have been reporting this
[58:54.760 --> 58:56.920]  for a long time now.
[58:56.920 --> 58:59.240]  When someone dies, the blood is liquefied,
[58:59.240 --> 59:00.520]  it's called undergolysis,
[59:00.520 --> 59:04.080]  and the morticians actually drain the blood out of the body.
[59:04.080 --> 59:05.080]  And now they can.
[59:05.080 --> 59:06.520]  There's just all these giant.
[59:06.520 --> 59:07.880]  Right, so that's the problem.
[59:07.880 --> 59:08.720]  They actually drain.
[59:08.720 --> 59:09.840]  It's like noodles are being pulled out.
[59:09.840 --> 59:11.920]  Right, so they're used to draining the body
[59:11.920 --> 59:14.040]  and then infusing the preservative
[59:14.040 --> 59:16.160]  in order to preserve the body.
[59:16.160 --> 59:17.440]  But now the blood doesn't drain,
[59:17.440 --> 59:18.960]  and so they had to dissect the vessels,
[59:18.960 --> 59:23.400]  and they're pulling out ginormous, rubbery, long can.
[59:23.400 --> 59:24.760]  And again, it's only countries
[59:24.760 --> 59:26.440]  that have given these experimental shots,
[59:26.440 --> 59:27.920]  whether it's Germany, whether it's France,
[59:27.920 --> 59:29.240]  the UK, Canada, the US,
[59:29.240 --> 59:31.360]  they're seeing the exact same things.
[59:31.360 --> 59:33.960]  I've had personal conversations with US,
[59:33.960 --> 59:36.080]  so Dr. Whatty, I know you did tell us something.
[59:36.080 --> 59:37.360]  What is that?
[59:37.360 --> 59:41.000]  That is a cast of a blood vessel.
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  They normally try to access the carotid artery.
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.440]  So there's probably the carotid artery,
[59:45.440 --> 59:48.360]  and they access the blood vessels,
[59:48.360 --> 59:49.480]  and it's easier to access.
[59:49.480 --> 59:51.160]  Yeah, he just pulled that out of a blood vessel.
[59:51.160 --> 59:52.360]  Right, and there's ones, Alex,
[59:52.360 --> 59:53.480]  you can see them on.
[59:53.480 --> 59:54.320]  The foot long.
[59:54.320 --> 59:55.960]  Oh yeah, so.
[59:55.960 --> 59:57.320]  This is tame what they put up.
[59:57.320 --> 59:58.800]  What the hell is that?
[59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.360]  This is like a science fiction movie.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.680]  It's like a science fiction movie,
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.880]  but let me tell you in practice,
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.080]  I have patients who have developed blood clots,
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.120]  and they're alive,
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.240]  and there are large ones in their legs and extremities,
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.440]  and one patient in my practice,
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.920]  we've actually had to remove the first rib,
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.840]  and actually physically pull it out
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.120]  of a blood vessel in the arm.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:18.960]  Good God.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.440]  Another one has, it's still in her leg now,
[01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.080]  it's over a year, and it's not dissolving
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.720]  as I'm administering blood thinner.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.760]  As a normal blood thinner.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.600]  Right.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:29.840]  So what do we know what they're made of?
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.720]  They are made of blood clotting elements,
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.800]  loaded with the Wuhan spike protein,
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.720]  which causes folding,
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:40.600]  what's called amylogenic changes.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:42.400]  So your cells are producing spike proteins
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.680]  that then mix with the.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.520]  Blood.
[01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.360]  With the platelets,
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.280]  and then it's creating these quasi-synthetic clots.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.320]  That's correct.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.480]  Wow.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.680]  I interrupted you though,
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.600]  I'm bad at that, but there's so many points.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.600]  You were saying you're talking to the coroners.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.600]  Well, I pray personal conversations with coroners
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.240]  on this to learn the process,
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.120]  and is it objective?
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:05.600]  John O'Looney in the UK has just gone out,
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:06.640]  he's gone viral, and he said,
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.240]  listen, this is going on,
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.320]  and he's describing what he's seen.
[01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.600]  Ryan Cole, pathologist in Idaho, examining these.
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:16.960]  I've recently published in the journal,
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:19.480]  Neurologic Disorders with Stephanie Sennoff,
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.440]  and Tony Karagakis from Greece, and Greg Nye.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.160]  Clearly the rationale for why this is happening,
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.280]  this explains why simultaneously
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.400]  there's neurodegenerative disease
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.000]  that there is a blood clotting going on.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.120]  In my practice in the last week, Alex,
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.720]  I saw two cases of blood clots
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.320]  forming 18 months after the last shot.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:43.240]  Wow.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.960]  18 months after the last shot.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.160]  And what's going on is there's some intervening COVID.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.120]  So getting the respiratory illness
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.160]  even further juices the system for more blood clotting.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.680]  So in theory, the best would be get COVID,
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:59.160]  get early treatment, get little systemic exposure,
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.200]  never take a vaccine, and limit the blood clotting risk.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.480]  Yeah, I just saw a big study at some of the stack here,
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.680]  where they looked at all the different countries
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.400]  and the ones that didn't take the shots
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.560]  and didn't have lockdowns, they got over it very quickly.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.160]  Those that didn't are still having problems.
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.720]  Yeah, you'd want to be in Haiti,
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.600]  or you'd want to be in Central Africa.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.160]  You know, those countries simply just didn't have
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:20.440]  the resources in their treasures to buy these vaccines.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.280]  And they did great.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.880]  Think about the living conditions in Haiti,
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.000]  and they've had virtually no COVID, COVID deaths,
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.600]  and they certainly have zero vaccine deaths
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.280]  because they haven't given any vaccines.
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:35.440]  So bottom line, this is a, almost like a,
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.920]  what's the term, something that goes into a solution
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.960]  and causes a chain reaction,
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.760]  and then somehow the spike protein interfaces
[01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.080]  with the blood and gels it.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:52.080]  In a sense like a catalyst, what we know is
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.160]  if the spike protein is physically in the clots,
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.000]  there was some studies actually before the vaccines
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.680]  showing spike protein alone could induce clotting
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:02.480]  in the absence of platelets, which is very interesting,
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.880]  meaning that fibrin and the other elements
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:05.880]  really seem to interact.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.280]  It doesn't even need your platelets to do it.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.320]  Right, and so the platelets do add on,
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.000]  obviously in human being, the platelets add on to this,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.320]  but this is a very unique blood clot.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:19.600]  It's very unique, and the blood clotting that happens,
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.880]  it happens in areas where there's sluggish flow,
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:26.000]  like the venous adrenus system in the brain,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:29.160]  the portal vein in the abdomen,
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:33.760]  but a remarkable paper by Burhild and colleagues in JAMA
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.160]  from three Nordic countries.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.000]  This is stunning, absolutely stunning.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.600]  They describe within 28 days of the vaccines,
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:42.720]  and they have Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.720]  and they rule out any COVID,
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.720]  but in three small countries, Alex, 7,750 devastating
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.480]  neurologic strokes and blood clots.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.000]  It's absolutely astonishing what these vaccines
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.480]  are doing on a population level.
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:02.000]  I want to go ahead, and not just air three minutes
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.920]  like you wanted to, it's so good,
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.800]  and Dale's good for us to air it.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.880]  I wanna just take a break and air,
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.800]  it's a 70 minute clip that's on your rumble account,
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.120]  it's also over at Del Big Tree's Highwire, it's excellent,
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:19.520]  and I wanna air most of this clip
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.040]  where they're calling for amnesty,
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.720]  but they're not giving us amnesty,
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.080]  they're not paid for what they've done,
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.000]  and they're still targeting schoolchildren
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.280]  with this federal authorization,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.320]  trying to make it mandatory in schools.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.400]  So we'll talk about that with Dr. Peter McCullough
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.240]  on the other side,
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.640]  and we have a very important announcement as well
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:38.120]  on how people can get prepared and deal with this.
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.000]  We'll also get your latest analysis
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.640]  on how we can naturally try to bolster our defenses.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.480]  That's all coming up.
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.840]  Please stay with us on the special Saturday transmission,
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.240]  and please share the live feed of this
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.120]  when we're streaming it out,
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.520]  and share the archive,
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.560]  the band of video, like our lives depend on it,
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.320]  because we can have Dr. Peter McCullough with his courage,
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.440]  and him being attacked,
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:00.400]  and all these other great people,
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.080]  and we can have this operation, this great crew,
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.840]  but if you, who are awesome, don't share it,
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.200]  it's like a tree falls in the forest,
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.080]  nobody heard it, so it didn't make a sound, okay?
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.200]  I mean, I cannot stress enough that people are like,
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.600]  oh, Dr. McCullough, you're so great,
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.640]  or Alex, you're so good, or, you know, no, no.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.080]  Literally, it'd be like if I had a box of matches
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.120]  and trying to build a fire, the freezing cold,
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:23.400]  I don't have kindling, or wood to do it,
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:24.600]  we don't get the fire.
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.800]  Yes, this broadcast is the match,
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.640]  we have the evidence, got the match right over here,
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.080]  but we've got to have the kindling,
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.480]  and we got to have the logs
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.200]  to set this brush fire in the minds of people,
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.760]  so, literally, I don't want to just strike matches here
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.080]  in 100 mile an hour wind,
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.200]  we get like 500,000 people tune in, you know, live,
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.480]  when we stream this, if all of you simply
[01:05:43.480 --> 01:05:45.200]  share the video from Band of Video,
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.800]  we'll get five, 10 million views,
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.600]  that'll be cut up, chain reaction, 100 million views,
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.080]  and we'll go break some more than the globalist ribs, okay?
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.920]  Because I'm not doing this to lose, I'm doing it to win.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.400]  So, we've got the truth, we're gonna stop them,
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.360]  they're coming back with a new attack soon,
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.720]  we're not gonna give them amnesty
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.160]  until they've had an Nuremberg trial,
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.000]  and we'll pray for them when they're getting hauled up there
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.320]  after a jury, after they've been found guilty,
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:10.160]  before we hang their asses for crimes against humanity.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.480]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:13.960]  Check out this headline.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:15.960]  You probably saw this in the Atlantic.
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:19.520]  Let's declare a pandemic amnesty.
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:22.120]  We need to forgive one another for what we did,
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.680]  and said we were in the dark about COVID.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.760]  See, this is that insanity plea I'm talking about.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.200]  Let's read some of this article,
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.480]  cause it's fascinating.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.040]  We have to put these fights aside
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.840]  and declare a pandemic amnesty.
[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.920]  We can leave out the will for purveyors
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.560]  of actual misinformation information, really?
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:41.800]  So, we're gonna leave out Tony Fauci, and the NIH,
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.000]  and the CDC, and the FDA that all lied to us,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.920]  while forgiving the hard calls that people had no choice
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.520]  but to make with imperfect knowledge.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.920]  Oh, so there it is.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.760]  No, let's forgive them.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.040]  They were making hard calls.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.720]  They didn't have the information.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.520]  Los Angeles County closed its beaches
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.040]  in summer 2020 ex post facto.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:59.560]  This means makes no more sense
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.680]  than my family's mass hiking trips.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.560]  But we need to learn from our mistakes and then let them go.
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.480]  We need to forgive the attacks too.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.240]  Okay, well let's think about it.
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.080]  Let's go on.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.480]  All this gloating and defensiveness continues
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.440]  to gobble up a lot of social energy
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.960]  and to drive the culture wars,
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.440]  especially on the internet.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.520]  These discussions are heated, unpleasant,
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.040]  and ultimately unproductive.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.400]  In the face of so much uncertainty,
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:26.440]  getting something right had a hefty element of luck.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.640]  Oh, so it's luck that the high wire was right
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.800]  like 99.999% of the time.
[01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.240]  And similarly, getting something wrong
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.880]  wasn't a moral failing.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.000]  Oh, wasn't it?
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.480]  The standard saying is that those who forget history
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.400]  are doomed to repeat it.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.480]  I agree with that.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:43.800]  But dwelling on the mistakes of history
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:46.600]  can lead to a repetitive doom loop as well.
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.200]  Let's acknowledge that we made complicated choices
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.200]  in the face of deep uncertainty
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.960]  and then try to work together to build back and move forward.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.480]  Well, look, there's some of that sentiment
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.440]  that I agree with.
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.400]  I've told you on this show we've got to learn to forget.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.920]  We've got to start having these conversations
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:03.080]  with our families again.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.800]  Thanksgiving's right around the corner.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:06.600]  Here comes Christmas.
[01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:07.840]  Even though we were all banned
[01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:11.120]  from the Thanksgiving table and Christmas table last year
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.520]  like we had leprosy or something,
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.680]  let's be the ones that forgive so we can go back.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:17.880]  But do we forget?
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.200]  Where are we at?
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.800]  So I want to discuss this for a moment
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:23.760]  because the concept of amnesty, which is like,
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.320]  let's just drop hands or forget it ever happened,
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.280]  really is on the back of a concept I would say
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.200]  called forgiveness.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.440]  So I think in some ways, what's being asked of us
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.600]  is to forgive, to forgive our families
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.720]  that banned us from the tables and were mean to us
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.560]  and said they never wanted to see us or our children again.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.520]  And I think forgiveness is a good thing.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.160]  But in order to forgive,
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.400]  there's something that has to happen.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.200]  First of all, I would really like to take this moment
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.360]  for everyone out there that thought they were opposed
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.320]  to the things that I was saying
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.480]  and were really down with censoring the highway
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.120]  and all those other things.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.040]  Could you please articulate for me
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.600]  exactly what it is that we are supposed to forgive?
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.560]  You see, because I don't know.
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.760]  I don't know what you know and what you don't know
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.480]  and what you don't know that you don't know.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.040]  And I think that that's important
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.240]  in this place of forgiveness.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.400]  So what are we supposed to forgive?
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.520]  Are we supposed to forgive the fact that, you know,
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.880]  you locked down and took away our jobs,
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:22.720]  our dreams of having a future that in that process
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.120]  you destroyed our economy, not just in America,
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.440]  but around the world, we're supposed to forgive that movement.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:32.920]  We're supposed to forgive all the sanitizing and the spraying
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.520]  and the invasive destruction of our not nasal passages
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:39.800]  as you tested us with a product that in itself
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.520]  couldn't even test properly.
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:43.720]  And how about all those that died
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.280]  and weren't treated right in hospitals
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.920]  and we couldn't even get to them to say goodbye,
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.360]  our loved ones, our elderly, our aunts, our uncles,
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.080]  our mothers, our fathers.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.840]  Instead, we were left outside and they were left alone.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.720]  We couldn't go to a funeral.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:59.360]  And how about all the suicides that took place
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:02.360]  and the child abuse and domestic abuse and drug abuse
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.360]  or turning our children into hypochondriacs?
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.040]  Are they going to forgive us for that,
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.480]  for destroying their education
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:11.000]  and putting them behind in reading and math?
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.480]  Are we forgiving for all of these reasons
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.960]  or will our children forgive us?
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.320]  And how about denying people transplants
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.560]  because they didn't want an experimental vaccine
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.320]  that might cause a very problem they needed to transplant for
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.480]  and then the police brutality,
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:27.320]  attacking those people that were standing in their truth,
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.720]  that wanted to watch their child play in a sports event
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.880]  without wearing a mask because they knew,
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.760]  as we now know, masks don't work.
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:36.040]  Should we forgive the president who promised us
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.200]  that he wouldn't force a vaccine upon us,
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.320]  then took away jobs from the military,
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.920]  from police officers, from frontline doctors
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:45.520]  and firefighters leaving them with nowhere to go
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.960]  and then the injuries.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.120]  People suffering from all sorts of seizures
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:51.920]  that are unexplained, being left in hospitals
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.400]  and the lies that were done by the pharmaceutical industry
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.640]  saying that these things never happened.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.920]  And then those problematic vaccines,
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.040]  not only are they hurting people,
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.200]  but they're still being mandated on our children.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:05.040]  Do we forgive why we're continuing to give this product
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.280]  to our innocent children that aren't at risk?
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.400]  And how many headlines of athletes crashing into the floor,
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.600]  unable to ever play again, maybe dead,
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.160]  or all of the people, the performers, and the singers
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.480]  that can't get through a concert
[01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.680]  or can't do a concert any longer.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:21.720]  This brand new normal,
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.440]  is this what we're supposed to forgive and forget
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:28.440]  and have amnesty for while it's happening right now?
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.880]  And most importantly,
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:32.440]  as you talk about the luck factor, I guess,
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.640]  well, if you got this right, you were lucky.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.320]  No, I have to be very clear.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.120]  We've said many times and shown you proof
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.880]  that we told you that they did not test
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.440]  whether or not the vaccine could stop transmission.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:48.360]  During the trials, this is now known to everybody,
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.760]  but we knew it because it was written
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.680]  in our own emergency use authorization
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:53.960]  in the very beginning.
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:55.400]  We didn't get lucky.
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.720]  We were reading the science
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.480]  when you were quoting experts that ended up being liars.
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.840]  But how about those doctors that weren't liars?
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:05.680]  How about the inventor of the mRNA technology?
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.000]  Did he get lucky?
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.840]  Did Robert Malone get lucky
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.880]  when he warned the world I invented this technology
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.440]  and it's not being used correctly
[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.000]  and it's gonna cause serious harm?
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:15.840]  Really?
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.720]  The inventor got lucky?
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:19.520]  No, what he got was censored.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.920]  He got shut down by the very people
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.440]  that we're being asked now to give amnesty to.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.520]  Oh, how convenient.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.760]  Or what about the doctors
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:30.200]  that still have their licenses under attack
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.040]  by laws that just got passed in California
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.440]  and are being written in other states,
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.200]  California law to set, regulate,
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:39.000]  dissemination of misinformation related to COVID-19,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.360]  meaning if you said any of the things
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:43.000]  that now proved to be true,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.880]  like the vaccine doesn't work
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.000]  or this virus has a very low death rate
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.680]  or maybe you should try ivermectin
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.080]  or hydroxychloroquine, you could lose your license.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.400]  Or in the case of the most world-renowned
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.040]  heart doctor in the world, Dr. Peter McCullough,
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.400]  he now has his board certifications
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.240]  that make him a cardiologist being taken away.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.120]  Why?
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.040]  Because he's been quoting the science
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:08.480]  from around the world on blood clots,
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.400]  on thrombocytopenia, on myocarditis,
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.480]  the swelling of the heart,
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:15.600]  which is something he knows better than anyone else about.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.360]  But still, no, in the moment
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.160]  where his license is being removed
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.600]  and he is under attack
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.920]  and where his certifications are being taken away,
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.760]  we're supposed to give amnesty right now.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.280]  You see, this is the problem.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.160]  We are not even through this situation.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.040]  And I have not heard you articulate.
[01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.280]  I'm still listening.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.440]  I'm still listening for exactly what it is
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.320]  you understand I'm supposed to forgive you for.
[01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.360]  Because there's a word that goes along with forgiveness
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.120]  if we're going to look at sort of the biblical
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:47.480]  or spiritual nature of this.
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:50.200]  And that word is repent.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.800]  You see, in order to deserve to be forgiven,
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:55.960]  you must articulate what you're being forgiven for.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.440]  That's called repenting.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:01.560]  Or how about, you know, when we think of a court case,
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.000]  where's your remorse?
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.480]  What are your remorseful for?
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.080]  Please explain to me what you think you did wrong here.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:10.200]  Because in the Nuremberg trials,
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.960]  which is what may be about to happen,
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.720]  should we get a new sentence in Congress
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.720]  here in the United States of America,
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.760]  the doctors did not repent.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.760]  They did not say we made a mistake.
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.040]  What they said was, we didn't know better.
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:24.760]  There was no way for us to know we were following orders.
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:27.400]  We were just doing what we were told.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.680]  There was no way to know better.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.520]  The science changed on us.
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.320]  As it turns out now, obviously sitting in this courtroom,
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:36.360]  it wasn't okay to test on innocent children products
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.280]  that hadn't been properly safety tested.
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:42.200]  It wasn't okay to avoid the proof of myocarditis
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:45.920]  and blood clotting and thrombocytopenia and anaphylaxis
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.640]  and all the things that we were seeing with the products.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:50.520]  Okay, yes, benefit of hindsight now.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.200]  Maybe you could say that, but we didn't know it then.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:56.840]  Therefore, we must be forgiven.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.760]  Well, I'm all about forgiveness,
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.480]  but I'm not even ready for that conversation
[01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.320]  until I hear those that made this mistake,
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.160]  those that continue to censor,
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:08.920]  those that continue to attack,
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.120]  and those that will not admit
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:15.120]  that these are not sudden adult dead syndrome deaths.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.600]  We are not randomly seeing the rise of death
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.800]  and excess mortality around the world
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:22.680]  because maybe we locked down for the wrong reasons.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.960]  No, when you stop being mystified by this rise in death
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.040]  and get to the reality that you gave an unproven,
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.160]  untested pharmaceutical product
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.440]  that was killing every animal in the animal trials
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.280]  prior to giving it to human beings,
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:40.320]  when you admit that just maybe it's the vaccine
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.280]  that is now killing all of us around the world
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.040]  that are dying and collapsing on fields
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:47.220]  and collapsing on stages.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:49.840]  It seems to me we're a long ways away from that.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.380]  When I think about where Jimmy Kimmel stood
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.240]  in the middle of this,
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.600]  shall we forgive him for saying things like this?
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:59.560]  Dr. Fauci said that if hospitals get any more overcrowded,
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.760]  they're gonna have to make some very tough choices
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.560]  about who gets an ICU bed.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:05.640]  I know that choice doesn't seem so tough to me.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.480]  Vaccinated person having a heart attack?
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.360]  Yes, come right on in.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:09.400]  We'll take care of you.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.440]  Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo.
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:13.760]  Rest in peace, Weezy.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:18.760]  I mean, we still got a lot of pandemwits out there.
[01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:24.640]  I guess it's ironic that he said,
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:28.520]  you know, vaccinated guy having a heart attack,
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.440]  which is exactly what appears to be happening
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.640]  to the vaccinated people around the world.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.800]  But if you're unvaccinated and have any need
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.680]  for the hospital, screw you, I want you to die.
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.880]  You know, they're harsh words.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:40.560]  It doesn't mean that just harsh words
[01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:42.000]  that we shouldn't forgive them.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.360]  And I suppose that there's those
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.480]  that went through the Holocaust
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:47.080]  that have to deal with themselves and ask themselves,
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.400]  should I forgive the doctors that were ended up,
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.280]  you know, being hung after the Nuremberg trials?
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.800]  After the courts decided it wasn't okay,
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.000]  just because that's what you were told to do,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.920]  just because you thought you were doing what was right.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:03.040]  In the end, it was wrong and you should have known better.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.520]  How do we know you know better
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.120]  when you tell us what you did wrong
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.760]  and that you actually know better?
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.960]  It's time to repent.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:13.120]  When you're ready to repent, I'm ready to forgive.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:15.720]  And in that moment, and then and only then,
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:18.240]  will we consider amnesty.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:19.960]  It's November 2022.
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.000]  And that means our historic biggest sale of the year

[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.040]  You're insane with all the stuff going on in this world.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.600]  If you don't boost your immune system,
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.400]  plus it keeps us on air, a win-win.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:42.080]  Alright, we're about to talk about something central
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.080]  to winning the war against tyranny.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.520]  And that's realizing why they target people like myself,
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:50.120]  why they target people like Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:52.200]  It's not about stopping us at the end of the day.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:54.360]  It's about intimidating others.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.960]  Because I was just asking him during that tape
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.560]  we just played of Del Bigtree,
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.120]  how are you doing through all this?
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.320]  What do you think their in-game is?
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:03.440]  And he basically said what I just said on air,
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.840]  because he's been through the same stuff we have.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.680]  He understands it.
[01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.000]  But for you to understand this is critical.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.760]  And for other doctors and scientists and researchers,
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.880]  but also mothers and fathers and daughters
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.040]  and sons and people speaking out
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.600]  about what they've witnessed, having your voice heard,
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:23.120]  this corruption, this evil can't take place
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.280]  unless they can silence us.
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.600]  So talk about what you've been through personally
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:30.480]  in this saga and your advice to others about where we are.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:32.840]  Because clearly we're winning the fight for hearts
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.920]  and minds right now.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.440]  The folks that launched this attack are in deep trouble.
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:39.040]  I think that's very fair to say,
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.960]  but understanding how they're striking back
[01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:44.360]  is key to our eventual total victory.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.560]  I agree.
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.960]  As a practicing internist and cardiologist
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.120]  trained in epidemiology at University of Michigan,
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.200]  I'm the most published person in my field
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.200]  in the world in history
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.160]  in terms of heart kidney interactions.
[01:19:56.160 --> 01:20:00.200]  I now have 60 peer-reviewed publications in COVID-19.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:03.800]  I've made myself a COVID-19 expert.
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.960]  Essentially now have three years of on-the-job training,
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:09.120]  scholarship, fellowship.
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.760]  And I've published the seminal approaches
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.000]  to how to treat the illness,
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.120]  collaborated with doctors all over the world.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.960]  My commentary and my analysis,
[01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:20.320]  my testimony has been beyond reproach
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:22.920]  in terms of precision and citation.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:27.280]  And what has occurred to me is not about me.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:30.480]  It's actually about trying to silence others,
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.800]  to hold me out as an example.
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.120]  So I've now lost two jobs.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:40.960]  Alex, on Friday, I was terminated from my practice job
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:44.160]  in Dallas without due process,
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.160]  without any clear reason.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.200]  It's the uncomfortableness in the room
[01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.360]  is that neither the people doing the termination nor me
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.440]  wanted the termination.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:58.000]  It was pretty obvious that something is going on.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.720]  I've been stripped of two editor ships
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.320]  where the impact factor was rising.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.040]  My track record as an editor at two major journals,
[01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:06.520]  reviews in cardiovascular medicine
[01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.720]  and cardioreal medicine was, again, beyond reproach.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.480]  By certified letter or email with no explanation.
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.240]  I've been stripped of two professorships
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.520]  here in the state of Texas.
[01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:19.880]  One with a follow-up letter that said,
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:23.880]  if we see our name next to yours, we're gonna sue you.
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:26.160]  So a preemptive lawsuit letter.
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.480]  I have a crushing lawsuit against me
[01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.160]  by the biggest health system in Texas
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:33.560]  with motions are not heard by the judge.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.240]  I paid for mediation, a mediation office.
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:37.920]  Mediation doesn't solve it in a day.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:41.280]  It is endless in the lawsuit that keep adding additional things
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.320]  into some type of settlement agreement.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.240]  I have had an entire society.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.160]  I was the president of the society,
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.680]  the Cardio Reno Society of America, Alex.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:54.360]  It was dissolved.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:58.840]  My society was dissolved, 600 members without any,
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.760]  none of these events occurred without any due process.
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.320]  There was no courtesy phone call.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.000]  There was no board meeting.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.880]  So when a police officer rides you a ticket
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.800]  for driving 10 miles over the speed limit,
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:11.320]  you have a day in court and they tell you what you did.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.680]  It's very cough to ask.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:15.040]  They won't even tell you what you've supposedly done.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.000]  No, these are one or two sentence letters.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.600]  A professor of medicine status is a status
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.320]  that's hard earned after decades of scholarship
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.520]  and work clinical care.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.400]  When there is a problem, there is a due process.
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.840]  There's faculty senate and there is a discussion
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.600]  of what was said and who agrees and who disagrees.
[01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:39.400]  When there's a journal, there's an editorial board meeting
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.320]  and there's a discussion if there's an outgoing editor.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.280]  Well, we know who's behind it.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:45.040]  It's DHS and the Disinformation Governance Board.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.600]  That broke a week ago, confirmed documents that they are
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:51.000]  targeting and harassing scientists and doctors
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.240]  that challenge the official story
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:55.880]  because the official story is a lie.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:59.800]  It's reasonable to assume that powerful government agencies
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.120]  or working through intermediaries, consultants actually try,
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.680]  you know, mechanisms to cover.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:05.520]  That's what it says.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:08.520]  They use the boards and think tanks and NGOs to carry it out.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.360]  Right, right.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.520]  They probably are working through intermediaries
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.560]  and there's likely money is being transferred
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.200]  as emergency countermeasure funding.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:17.920]  I can't verify any of this, but I am telling you,
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:21.760]  this has the look and feel of a government operation
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:24.080]  against its own people, targeting people
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.360]  of very high profile like yourself and myself.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.600]  And again, the message is actually not for us.
[01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:33.280]  We actually get stronger and louder.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.520]  We're perfectly fine.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:37.920]  In fact, this is very similar to that Star Wars scene
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.160]  where Darth Vader's gonna strike down Obi-Wan Kenoban
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.880]  and he says, Darth, if you strike me down,
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.040]  I'll come back even more powerful.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:45.960]  And it's true.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.520]  It's not about us, Alex.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:50.160]  It's about silencing everybody else.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.120]  And that is the key.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.520]  So let's talk about building our new-owned economies.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.600]  Let's talk about a great law that Trump passed
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.480]  that allowed doctors with licensure
[01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.800]  to operate all over the United States.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.040]  I know Tucker Carlson covered this a week ago.
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:10.960]  Foster Coulson headed up by you.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.920]  There are a lot of great telephonic medicine,
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.080]  a lot of great online medicine,
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:17.120]  but you guys have launched a wellness company,
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.160]  which I am so proud to be promoting,
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:20.680]  which is gonna be a big part of the show now
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.160]  because there's a lot of other great groups out there.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.920]  But I know you're the best.
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:27.520]  I know that Foster Coulson is a great manager
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.400]  and really done great companies before.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:32.880]  You guys are putting the very best groups together.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:35.440]  People can find out about it at onlinehealthnow,
[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:38.400]  one word, onlinehealthnow.com,
[01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:42.520]  and we'll put that URL up on screen there in your name key.
[01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:45.200]  But tell us about this because this is exciting.
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:47.960]  When big pharma and medicine is being bought off,
[01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:50.040]  we still have free market rights
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:52.920]  to go out and choose the market where we see fit
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.640]  and basically displace this tyranny.
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.040]  What's occurred over the last three years
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:02.240]  has taught Americans that trust is everything
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:06.840]  in their healthcare providers, doctors, nurses,
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.920]  nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.320]  other allied health professionals.
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:15.360]  Among our team was started to be fracturing
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.320]  where people walked off the job
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.640]  because it didn't like what they were seeing was going on.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.640]  Many felt the oppression of the vaccines.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:25.560]  And we've said for a while
[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.160]  that there must be an alternative.
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:29.920]  There must be something else
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.920]  than this authoritarian, totalitarian takeover of medicine
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.640]  and e-commerce juggernaut, Foster Coulson out of Canada
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:44.040]  has really, really stepped up
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:46.520]  and he's been working favoritously for months.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.920]  He reached out to myself and we formed actually
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.160]  a what's called chief medical board.
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.800]  I'm the chief scientific officer of the company.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.480]  I've taken a board position.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.680]  Richard Amerling, formerly dean of a school of medicine,
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:02.920]  a very, very renowned nephrologist
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:06.640]  is heading up the medical affairs.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.360]  Heather Gessling, a family physician from Missouri,
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.040]  leading up the clinical details.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.240]  And then we have Harvey Risch,
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.720]  who's recently retired from Yale University
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.560]  in epidemiology.
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.400]  He is our chief epidemiologist.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:20.720]  He's not a practicing doctor,
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.880]  but he's been a frequent contributor with me
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:25.440]  on Fox News now for several years.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.680]  To quantify how big this is, you have a license,
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:32.120]  they have license, the system's trying to stop it.
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.960]  What happens when real doctors and scientists
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.240]  get together and create their own systems?
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:39.800]  That is the absolute libertarian way to counter this.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.840]  Because we have the power
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.680]  of not only creating websites and apps,
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.200]  but creating what's called verticals.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.120]  The verticals, there is an entire vertical of healthcare
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:53.120]  of telemedicine doctors, many of them,
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.880]  the groups are working in coalescing to provide
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.720]  24 by seven healthcare through your phone.
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.560]  So bottom line, there's a massive attack
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:05.280]  on doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses,
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:07.640]  scientists, researchers.
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.000]  They're all looking for a home.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.960]  We get top names with top funding
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.960]  to then create the new future.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.360]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.640]  And so the doctors are coming on board,
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.920]  issues like malpractice and electronic records
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.880]  and all of that now is doctors are being relieved of that
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:26.800]  through this new system.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.840]  That's something great Trump did.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.920]  Let's go back to the beginning.
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.120]  Trump passed this law getting this done.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.200]  I give him a lot of credit.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:36.000]  He moved quickly on many aspects of the pandemic,
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:37.240]  but this one was big.
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:39.080]  This was part of some of the relief measures
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.640]  where doctors then had so much more freedom
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:44.240]  in terms of their practice using telemedicine.
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:46.280]  The telemedicine technology got better.
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:49.440]  But it's the practice of medicine, Alex,
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.680]  that can actually be integrated with labs
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:52.640]  taken in the home.
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:53.920]  So someone comes out to the home,
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.640]  can get a blood sample.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:58.360]  We now have integration with diagnostics
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.480]  so people can get x-rays, ultrasounds, et cetera.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.520]  Sure, we can use the technocracies new economy
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.080]  against them that everything's integrated.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:05.920]  Right.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.600]  And so the integration part is key.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.720]  Another key part is pharmacies.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.720]  You know, we have the big brand name pharmacies
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.680]  that worked against patients and doctors.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.520]  That's CVS, Walgreens, and others.
[01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:19.320]  But the community pharmacies, they were the heroes.
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.680]  Now the community pharmacies are aligned
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:24.560]  in this type of approach as a vertical.
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:25.400]  There are-
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.720]  So that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:30.040]  The hell of the last three years, though,
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:33.160]  with resistance is producing the future of our health.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.000]  That's right.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  And with no, absolutely no impediment
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.720]  to receiving high quality care,
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.520]  receiving the medicines that people need,
[01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.320]  and getting it in a timely fashion.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.600]  There's verticals for health coaches
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.120]  and other allied health personnel,
[01:28:52.120 --> 01:28:53.680]  nutraceuticals and supplements.
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:55.480]  So there's an online store.
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:59.000]  Foster Colson got into this actually helping
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.160]  the Zelenko Foundation, Zav Zelenko,
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.400]  and his innovation with the Z-Stack.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:07.720]  And now the wellness company has been born.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:12.440]  It literally, the doors, it just hit its opening,
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.120]  if you will, just a few weeks ago.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.720]  Foster Colson came down.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.520]  He was in the Tucker Carlson studio,
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:22.000]  did an hour long program with Tucker, very, very dynamic.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:22.840]  And-
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:24.280]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:26.960]  And there have been other great groups trying this.
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:29.720]  They saved so many lives with therapeutics.
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.960]  We saw so many of the big pharmacies gouging people,
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.160]  not giving them Avramectin, Hydroxychlorica,
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.600]  not giving them the steroid aerosolizers.
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.080]  But it was the online folks that got around it
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:40.920]  and really saved millions of lives.
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:43.960]  And now you guys with the top people in real funding
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.160]  are now launching this to really be the future of medicine
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.720]  and a counter to the free market,
[01:29:49.720 --> 01:29:53.280]  to Big Pharma's takeover of much of our medical system.
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.920]  That's completely correct.
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.920]  And you know, let's give credit to these groups
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.300]  that really got things going.
[01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:01.400]  So we had Ben Marble and MyFreeDoctor.com,
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:02.760]  basically a charity service.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:05.480]  Ben's delivery carry, under testimony in the US Senate,
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.600]  Ben indicated he has treated with his group
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:09.560]  300,000 Americans with COVID.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:11.760]  I mean, this is a stunning accomplishment.
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:12.960]  Frontline Critical Care Network-
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.680]  It almost no deaths.
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:16.120]  Yeah, just a handful of deaths.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:18.280]  Frontline Critical Care Network,
[01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:20.840]  Paul Merrick and Pierre Corey,
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.680]  FLCC is a delivery mechanism,
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:25.400]  American Frontline Doctors, Simone Gold.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.000]  Give credit to these, speak with an MD was another one.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.560]  These organizations, many-
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.400]  I can tell you, look, I got COVID
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.640]  and I've had flu, I've had other stuff
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.800]  and I'm a pretty healthy guy.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.480]  I've been sick every three or four years.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.340]  Felt like a gorilla was on my chest,
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:41.560]  almost killed my dad and my mom.
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:43.600]  My wife is like an athlete
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:44.680]  and she was like, I need to go to the hospital,
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:45.520]  I can't breathe.
[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:47.560]  And then I got involved with one of the telephonic doctors
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.240]  we had on the show and they got me.
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.940]  And within hours, I felt a lot better within a day,
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.040]  almost completely better.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.400]  It was like night and day.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:56.000]  And if I had gone to a mainline doctor,
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.840]  I'd been in the hospital on a ventilator dead.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:58.880]  Absolutely.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:01.120]  And you know, the US government and the agencies
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:04.120]  and all the countermeasure money didn't give a penny
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:05.680]  to these telemedicine services.
[01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:09.000]  They gave 50,000 plus bucks to put some on a ventilator.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:09.840]  That's true.
[01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.640]  It was all counterproductive.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:14.600]  These telemedicine companies were heroes.
[01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:17.320]  Many of them I think will probably be very attracted
[01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.840]  to fold in with the wellness company
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:22.200]  and be well supported.
[01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.960]  I'm really proud of the effort.
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.760]  I know my practice will be migrating onto the platform.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.520]  I'm gonna be much more flexible.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:32.120]  I'll have the alacrity to do what I need to do
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.040]  because patients nowadays, they expect to get a doctor
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:38.920]  by their cell phone and have a communication
[01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:42.120]  and be able to head off some disaster before it happens.
[01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:43.440]  The only way we can do it is to be...
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.160]  So this is educated doctors and researchers and pharmacists
[01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.160]  that are ready to deliver.
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:49.680]  And again, we'll put that back on screen,
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.840]  the official website,
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.840]  but when you go to onlinehealthnow.com,
[01:31:53.840 --> 01:31:55.440]  I'm working to get them,
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:57.800]  but I'm doing it right now to support it as a sponsor
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.040]  because I totally trust Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:02.520]  I know how great the funding is of this.
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.160]  All the folks are getting involved in.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.440]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.440]  It is so important that you have access to real doctors,
[01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:13.560]  real pharmacists, real folks that can send you
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.720]  to other trusted doctors in your area,
[01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.320]  nurse practitioners in your area,
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:21.160]  testing facilities that are really trying to help you,
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.840]  onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.400]  Because again, this isn't just online.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.520]  This is creating a network of the future.
[01:32:26.520 --> 01:32:27.600]  It's true.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.800]  Initially it has to start out online,
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:31.880]  but I may be able to, in Dallas,
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:34.600]  actually have the first kind of physical installation
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:37.040]  of the company and MBO.
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:37.880]  You were telling me off there,
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:39.160]  you're feverishly working on that.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.640]  We're working on this very hard.
[01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:43.840]  It needs to happen because Americans right now
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.800]  have lost their trust.
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.160]  I have so many patients that say,
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:50.120]  listen, my doctor has actually forced this vaccine on me
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:51.640]  and I'm not gonna take it.
[01:32:51.640 --> 01:32:54.560]  Other patients, Alex, have been discharged.
[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.520]  They've been thrown out of their doctor's office
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.600]  because they won't take a vaccine.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.760]  I know people in Austin that have children
[01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:04.320]  and their pediatricians are firing their patient
[01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.480]  because they won't give their seven-year-old a shot.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:08.760]  I mean, that is, can you speak to that?
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.280]  You know, I can tell you that is an abrogation
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:13.400]  of the Hippocratic Oath.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.520]  It's an abrogation of the Declaration of Helsinki
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.960]  in terms of full informed consent.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:22.200]  These COVID-19 vaccines are still fully experimental.
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:24.560]  No one can receive any pressure, coercion,
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:26.000]  or threat of reprisal.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.640]  According to the Nuremberg Code,
[01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:31.240]  these doctors have trampled all over the code of ethics.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.560]  They've lost their minds.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.920]  We were talking during the break
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.720]  when we were airing that Del Bigtree piece about who runs.
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:39.160]  We know the Davos scripts the mouthpiece,
[01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:42.360]  but why would the people that did this
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:43.480]  run something out like this?
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:45.160]  They had to know it was gonna cause these problems.
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.360]  They weren't stupid.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.000]  I guess depopulation, it's so reckless.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.760]  Destroy faith in the system causes societal collapse.
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:55.040]  We know they want to post-industrial worlds in 2030.
[01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.640]  In our book Courage to Face COVID-19
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.160]  investigative true crime author,
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:03.760]  John Leek spends some time on the World Economic Forum,
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:06.320]  led by Klaus Schwab.
[01:34:06.320 --> 01:34:10.040]  And within a few months of the COVID-19 crisis emerging,
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:13.480]  you know, he publishes a book, COVID-19 and the Great Reset.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.960]  What John Leek says is take it seriously.
[01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:17.440]  He wrote the book.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.600]  Take the book seriously.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:22.280]  He says this is a very narrow window of time
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:27.280]  that is available to achieve a new world order.
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:30.600]  He's been writing about the fourth industrial revolution.
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:33.840]  The fourth industrial revolution is not changing industry.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:36.160]  It's about changing human beings
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.800]  and changing the nature of populations, Alex.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:42.960]  This is a diabolical scheme and it's in the open.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.160]  And that's why they have the SCGs and all this UN control.
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.960]  Once they get these digital currencies in,
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:49.680]  deciding where you can spend money.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:51.040]  That's why it's a revolutionary act,
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:53.000]  not just to get independent medicine,
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.040]  independent prescriptions and real diagnoses.
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:57.800]  We have to build the new systems.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.040]  That's why onlinehealthnow.com,
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:01.920]  the wellness company is so critical,
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.840]  is when we got some of the Clinton Foundation documents
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.840]  six, seven years ago when World End Daily sued and got them,
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.520]  the Clintons when they first got elected
[01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.040]  were obsessed with shutting down populist,
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.480]  conservative and nationalist infrastructure.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:17.920]  They didn't want an online newspaper.
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:19.320]  They didn't want filmmaking.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:21.480]  They didn't want doctors that were conservative
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.960]  because then people are gonna gravitate towards that.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.720]  This is how we build the new world is the new economy.
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.560]  It's true.
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:32.560]  It's a situation with the institutions are so corrupt.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.920]  They've been so distorted.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:39.920]  The thinking of the mind, Alex, is so far gone.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.040]  Let me give an example.
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:44.880]  I was at a live program yesterday
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.840]  at the University of Texas in Dallas.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.680]  I was about to say, I'm gonna stop right now
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.320]  and I'm gonna give you the floor for the next 20 minutes
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.880]  because you really get my brain fire
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.640]  and we've covered so many wild topics.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.160]  We've hit at every different, so many different angles,
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:57.120]  but I'm gonna shut up now.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:59.000]  You're gonna host the show for 20 minutes here
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.160]  and just start over with everything you haven't hit
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:02.880]  because they're trying to suppress what you're saying.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.160]  They're more scared of you than anybody in medicine.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:08.560]  So we need to hear unfiltered Dr. Peter McCuller right now.
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.160]  I wanted to get started out with an example
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.880]  of how the human mind is being distorted.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:17.120]  We've covered COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, the virus,
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:19.080]  the COVID-19, the illness,
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.720]  and this distortion of human thought that has occurred.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.960]  And it's been described as mass formation
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:29.960]  or a fear-driven trance that people are in,
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:33.320]  but the human mind is changing rapidly.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:35.400]  Thought patterns are contagious,
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:37.760]  spreading from one person to another,
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.560]  and it's not just regarding COVID-19.
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:42.560]  I'll give an example.
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:47.560]  There is a relative sudden confusion regarding gender,
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:49.800]  man or woman.
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:52.920]  And in 2021, the American Medical Association
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:57.520]  launched a campaign stating that doctors should no longer
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:00.480]  put the gender assignment on a birth certificate.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.400]  So for the millennia of understanding gender,
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.160]  man versus woman, suddenly that was all out the window.
[01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:13.400]  The entire industry of knowing the gender before birth
[01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:18.240]  and having a nursery be pink or blue out the window.
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:20.600]  This is in 2021.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:24.680]  I was at a live program last night in Richardson, Texas,
[01:37:24.680 --> 01:37:26.880]  at the University of Texas at Dallas
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:31.040]  with Senator Bob Cole and Bob Hall.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.400]  And we had many prominent doctors there.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.680]  We were honoring him and we gave speeches,
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:39.960]  but right next door to us was an event.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:42.560]  It was actually a retirement party
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.720]  in the Alumni Center there.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.560]  But the person leading the event was a large man,
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.080]  clearly over six feet tall,
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.200]  but he was fully dressed as a woman.
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:59.200]  And there appeared to be with makeup and a dress
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.720]  and all the accompaniments there.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.720]  And there were alumni there, conservatively dressed,
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:09.400]  nodding their heads and listening to what he had to say.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:14.200]  And it was just a snapshot in my mind
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:16.520]  that I'm probably not gonna forget,
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:20.840]  but of how universities have changed as an institution,
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:22.840]  how things have changed.
[01:38:22.840 --> 01:38:27.000]  There's been a clear promotion of gender ambiguity,
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.720]  gender change, transsexualism.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:32.160]  There is a promotion, there's no doubt about it.
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.400]  Everyone's aware of the Vanderbilt University
[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:38.560]  now center for gender change surgery.
[01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:40.720]  And as a doctor, I can tell you
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:45.720]  that the vast majority of individuals are either XX,
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.200]  that they're women or they're XY and they're men.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:51.080]  There's a few hemathridites in between,
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.680]  but it's extremely rare.
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:56.760]  This large shift towards gender confusion,
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.840]  or in fact, not assigning gender
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:02.520]  and then having a child try to decide their gender
[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.840]  before puberty and undergo surgery and hormonal manipulation.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:11.840]  In my conservative interpretation as a doctor,
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.720]  that that is distorting the human body,
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:19.520]  the God-given gift that we all have.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.760]  There's a distortion of that through this
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.720]  relatively sudden gender confusion
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:28.920]  that's fallen down on human beings.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:33.480]  So through a series of destabilizing events,
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.400]  and what has occurred now with disrupted
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:43.400]  presidential administrations, contested elections,
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:47.920]  this injection of gender confusion, COVID-19 pandemic,
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:51.040]  we're under an emergency for COVID-19 now,
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.920]  yet people don't see any emergency around them.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:57.160]  We're actually under an emergency for a monkeypox emergency.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:00.160]  President Biden declared a national monkeypox emergency.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.000]  The World Health Organization declared
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.480]  a national monkeypox emergency.
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:05.760]  When we look around ourselves,
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.440]  we don't see any emergency.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.000]  There's no perception that there's a calamity
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.400]  occurring anywhere.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:18.760]  What we see is a series of intentional events.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.880]  These are intentional events.
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:22.440]  They're global.
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:25.440]  They appear to be coordinated.
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:28.360]  And in our book, Courage to Face COVID-19,
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:33.680]  the website is courage-to-face-covid.com.
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:38.080]  We outline, there is a biopharmaceutical complex.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:41.880]  And at the top, we believe it's the World Health Organization,
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:46.040]  the World Economic Forum, the Gates Foundation,
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.000]  the Rockefeller Foundation, the Wellcome Trust,
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.640]  the entity they formed called CEPI,
[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:55.600]  the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:59.800]  CEPI funded as a vaccine incubator
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.920]  that the only response to a pandemic
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:04.560]  would be mass vaccination.
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.040]  And then a coordination with all the major health authorities,
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:12.360]  CDC, NIH, and FDA in the United States,
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:17.360]  the MHRA in the UK, TGA in Australia, EMA in Europe.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.080]  With the major pharmaceutical industry,
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.760]  and I think Americans have gotten this confused,
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:25.920]  Americans have pointed out that big pharma is the villain,
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:29.520]  that really Pfizer or Moderna is the villain.
[01:41:29.520 --> 01:41:31.920]  Well, as we understand it in our book,
[01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.560]  Pfizer and Moderna, Johnson & Johnson,
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:36.040]  AstraZeneca outside the United States,
[01:41:36.040 --> 01:41:38.200]  now Novavex inside the United States,
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.760]  they are suppliers, and in a sense,
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:43.440]  they're almost figurehead suppliers.
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:45.160]  Under the EUA products,
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:49.240]  and I can tell you this is for sure with anthrax
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:53.240]  through smallpox, monkeypox, and with SARS-CoV-2,
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:58.240]  for sure, these are military products, military products.
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:01.800]  And on my website now on America Outlaw Talk Radio,
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:06.800]  McCullough Report, you can find the most recent podcast
[01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:08.880]  that's going viral right now that I conducted
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.520]  with Alexandria Sasha Ledipova.
[01:42:12.520 --> 01:42:17.520]  And we outline here a clear fact pattern
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:23.520]  that the COVID-19 vaccines and the other related products
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:27.520]  are military products, that this is a military operation,
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:31.520]  that DARPA, the military research unit,
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:34.520]  and then BARDA, the NIH unit, they work in concert,
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:38.520]  they had a plan to use messenger RNA technology,
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:42.520]  stated many years in advance that they were gonna use
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.520]  this technology, here's the graphic right here,
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:47.520]  this is the ADEPT P3 program.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:52.520]  Look at this, 60 days to stop a pandemic,
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:56.520]  60 days to stop a pandemic, it even has an email.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:00.520]  This was up in 2017, look at the date, 2017,
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.520]  the program starts years before that.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.520]  Another piece to the puzzle is the movement
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:11.520]  of billionaires, so people are very familiar with Bill Gates
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.520]  and how through antitrust and the browser controversy
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:21.520]  that he quits being a software juggernaut
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:23.520]  and becomes a philanthropist.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:27.520]  Well, all of his same tendencies as,
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:31.520]  in terms of antitrust, in terms of collusion,
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:34.520]  are transferred into the Gates Foundation,
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:38.520]  which becomes very predatory, pushing mass vaccination
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.520]  all over the world.
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:43.520]  Another billionaire is Stefan Bainzell,
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:48.520]  who was leading BioMiru in BioMiru under Jacques Chirac,
[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:53.520]  commissions the construction of the Wuhan Institute
[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:57.520]  of Virology Biosecurity Lab Level 4, the BSL Level 4.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:03.520]  That's Stefan Bainzell, a billionaire working for BioMiru.
[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:07.520]  What happens in 2011 after he finishes construction
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.520]  of the lab in Wuhan, China, 2011?
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:14.520]  He leaves his giant company and joins a one-person company
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:17.520]  in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Moderna,
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:20.520]  and then he starts working with the NIH
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:24.520]  on crafting the patent for the Moderna vaccine.
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.520]  This starts in 2011 and the vaccine comes forward.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.520]  What I'm telling you is the COVID-19 vaccines
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:36.520]  are a product of incredible collaboration,
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:40.520]  collusion, if you will, between a syndicate that is formed.
[01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:43.520]  This occurred long before President Trump.
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:46.520]  These vaccines were not developed under Operation Warp Speed.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.520]  Operation Warp Speed became a moniker
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:56.520]  for getting these quickly through any type of regulatory hurdles,
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:01.520]  but the concept of messenger RNA was born a long time ago.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:04.520]  We have a situation where the biopharmaceutical complex
[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:09.520]  now is so powerful that nothing can stop it,
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.520]  that it has full cooperation from the intelligence community,
[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:18.520]  has full cooperation through all the public health agencies.
[01:45:18.520 --> 01:45:21.520]  As we peel back the onion here,
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.520]  and every time it's either through a court action and discovery
[01:45:26.520 --> 01:45:30.520]  or through the FOIA mechanism, the Freedom of Information Act mechanism,
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:32.520]  we get evidence of this.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:36.520]  So, for instance, American First Legal through FOIA
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:40.520]  has the fact pattern and the evidence that the CDC
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:44.520]  and government agencies were regularly meeting with Twitter
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.520]  and with Facebook to craft the government false narrative.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.520]  How were they crafting the narrative?
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:54.520]  They were suppressing certain users who were bringing information
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:58.520]  forward on the early treatment of COVID-19.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:02.520]  They were deleting certain accounts or banning accounts
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:07.520]  to kind of tailor how the messaging would be heard globally on the platform,
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:11.520]  and then they were promoting pro-vaccine messaging
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:14.520]  throughout the social media network.
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:19.520]  A whole variety of units arose that were fact-checking units
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.520]  that had funding that was trackable back to the biopharmaceutical complex.
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:26.520]  These fact-checkers were mainly anonymous,
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.520]  and they put out false counterclaims.
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.520]  So, if I made a particular statement and I cited the evidence,
[01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.520]  a fact-checker would come out anonymous and say,
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:38.520]  Dr. McCull is wrong.
[01:46:38.520 --> 01:46:40.520]  Well, based on what?
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:45.520]  There was no justification for or nor any authority
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.520]  for this fact-checker to put out a false counterclaim.
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:55.520]  These almost invariably trace back to the biopharmaceutical complex.
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:00.520]  This is, and that's the reason why the show is so aptly named, Info Wars.
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:03.520]  It is a war of information out there.
[01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:05.520]  Then there's disruptive forces.
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:07.520]  So, I'll give you one disruptive force.
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.520]  He's right here in Austin, Texas, Joe Rogan.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:12.520]  Joe Rogan starts to bring people on,
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:16.520]  and with his large audience, far larger than mainstream TV,
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:19.520]  starts to initially brought on Brett Weinstein and Pierre Corrie
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:24.520]  talking about the virus and Ivor Mectin because Joe had received it.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:26.520]  Then he brings me on in December.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:31.520]  I give a full outline of the virus, early treatment, and the vaccines.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:34.520]  Then he brings on Dr. Robert Malone and not a clinician,
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:36.520]  but someone who's been a vaccine consultant.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:38.520]  Malone builds this out.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:42.520]  And the jaw-dropping Rogan interview occurs in January of 2022
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:45.520]  when he brings on Majid Nawaz from the UK.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:48.520]  And when he brings on Majid Nawaz,
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:51.520]  Rogan's jaw is dropped on the table because Majid says,
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.520]  yes, this is part of a bigger plan.
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.520]  This is about digital currency.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:01.520]  It's about these global digital passports,
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:03.520]  social credit scores,
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:07.520]  a global method of human control
[01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:11.520]  that tracks all the way up to the World Economic Forum
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:15.520]  and what Klaus Schwab has put out as the fourth industrial revolution.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:19.520]  It's clear this is all falling into place.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:22.520]  It's a mind-blowing reality.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:25.520]  And when I was Steve Bannon recently,
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:28.520]  who is a terrific individual, I've got a chance to know him.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.520]  I have tremendous respect for him,
[01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.520]  and I'm not a hardcore right-wing person at all.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.520]  I'm very much a political moderate, and I've told Steve that.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:37.520]  But what Steve said is, thank God you guys wrote the book.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.520]  Alex Jones has got a terrific new book out, reset.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:44.520]  Thank God you wrote the books because you can hang on to them.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:47.520]  They have citations, and they're not going to be corrupted.
[01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:49.520]  But what Bannon says is, you can already see it,
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:52.520]  that the corruption of the electronics is happening.
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:55.520]  And the disruptive forces are people like myself.
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:48:57.520]  Alex Jones, I'll tell you, Joe Rogan, I'll tell you another one.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:48:58.520]  Elon Musk.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.520]  Elon Musk buying Twitter is disruptive
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:06.520]  because now this entire global censorship and false narrative plan
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:09.520]  has now gotten a ripple in the matrix.
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:15.520]  This is almost like a dark force where now there's a disruption that's occurred.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:18.520]  Hero doctors all over the world have come forward,
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:21.520]  and we've seen medical censorship for the first time.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:24.520]  What you've heard today as a prominent doctor
[01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.520]  with a spotless clinical and research track record,
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.520]  I could be the first doctor in history
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:33.520]  stripped of my residency and fellowship in my credentials
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.520]  for purely political reasons
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.520]  by operatives that almost certainly are government operatives
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:43.520]  that are trying to advance a false narrative.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:45.520]  But I don't see that as a sign of their strength.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.520]  I see it as a sign of their weakness.
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:49.520]  It's entirely possible.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.520]  What we're seeing is we're seeing signs of cracking.
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:54.520]  Cracking.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:55.520]  Look, give me an example.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:58.520]  Just having Ron DeSantis have a narrow win
[01:49:58.520 --> 01:50:00.520]  with Ron bringing in Joe Ledappo.
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:01.520]  Joe and I published.
[01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.520]  Oh, and he's devastating him.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.520]  And he has been in Florida.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.520]  He's been absolutely devastating.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:07.520]  I'll tell you another one.
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.520]  Disruptive force.
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:10.520]  She spoke at CPAC just after me.
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.520]  Corry Lake running for governor of Arizona.
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:17.520]  Trump and Steve Bannon were very gracious to Corry.
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:18.520]  Well, that's the good news.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.520]  As negative as their attacks are,
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.520]  it's only triggered the world to wake up.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:23.520]  Absolutely.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.520]  We have governor races.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:27.520]  I've mentioned Lake and Arizona,
[01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:30.520]  but also Scott Jensen, a physician in Minnesota.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:32.520]  Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania.
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.520]  I've had a chance to meet all of them.
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.520]  Senator Ron Johnson is up for reelection.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.520]  He's been our strongest US senator by far.
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:40.520]  National hero.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:43.520]  And you know, there are 47 congressmen, Alex,
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.520]  that wrote a letter to Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense.
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.520]  These 47 congressmen are heroes.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.520]  They told Lloyd Austin, drop the mandates,
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:54.520]  drop the vaccines.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:55.520]  They're not safe.
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:56.520]  They're not effective.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:58.520]  Call back our soldiers who are dismissed
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.520]  and give them back pay.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:00.520]  Wow.
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.520]  Well, we've been going over an hour and a half here with you.
[01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:06.520]  And again, you go on Fox two, three minutes here and there.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.520]  Make great little points.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:11.520]  People don't get to hear the full analysis you're engaged in.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:16.520]  In closing, other key points you think viewers and listeners
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:17.520]  should be aware of.
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:20.520]  I think people at this point in time,
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:23.520]  and I said at my new substack courageous discourse today,
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:26.520]  my issue at the end, I always give patients something to do.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:27.520]  The public something to do.
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:29.520]  The next time you're approached with a vaccine
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.520]  and I'm not anti-vaccine, I've taken every single vaccine
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:34.520]  up to the COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:35.520]  I didn't skip a one.
[01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.520]  My mom had me take them.
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:38.520]  My kids took them.
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:40.520]  I am not an anti-vaccine doctor.
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.520]  But let me tell you this.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:43.520]  I'm courageous discourse.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:46.520]  I, at the bottom of that substack, I tell you, listen,
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:48.520]  you're going to go into the doctor.
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.520]  If you're going to take another vaccine,
[01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:54.520]  you better ask if messenger RNA is in it because it's clear
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:57.520]  they've already signaled that they are going to try
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:00.520]  to have messenger RNA become a product line
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:02.520]  that's going to get into our body.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:03.520]  Without approval.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:07.520]  Without any type of proper oversight, development,
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:08.520]  or approval.
[01:52:08.520 --> 01:52:10.520]  And this is permanent.
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:13.520]  Everything we can tell, this is permanent.
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:15.520]  This permanently changes the human body.
[01:52:15.520 --> 01:52:16.520]  The message.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:17.520]  This is a revolution over our bodies.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.520]  A revolution over choice.
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:21.520]  And it's just what Klaus Schwab talked about.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.520]  Changes.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:24.520]  We must take over the bodies.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:27.520]  Yeah, he, you know, in our substack,
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:29.520]  John Leek wrote a really fun piece.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.520]  And I did one at Laura Ingraham too.
[01:52:31.520 --> 01:52:37.520]  Klaus Schwab reminds us of Ernst Stavos Blofeld,
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:40.520]  the head of specter in the Bond movie.
[01:52:40.520 --> 01:52:43.520]  If you can get a picture of Blofeld,
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:45.520]  the head of specter in Bond,
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:47.520]  that's what that's who Schwab reminds us of.
[01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.520]  And Schwab doesn't.
[01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:50.520]  Well, they usually don't ever show Blofeld.
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:51.520]  They show the cat.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.520]  Yeah, but, you know, they show Blofeld.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:57.520]  You know, Schwab doesn't conceal it.
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:52:59.520]  There's some, there's some footage of him
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.520]  wearing almost like a Darth Vader,
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:04.520]  a black shield type.
[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:05.520]  Playing on outfits.
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:06.520]  Yeah.
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.520]  You can't, you can't make this stuff up.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.520]  He's talking about changing the human body.
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.520]  He's had a love affair.
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.520]  He says it's a revolution.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.520]  They're taking our bodies over.
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:16.520]  And so is his high priest.
[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:18.520]  Noah, you all Harari.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:19.520]  Well, yeah, I tell you,
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:21.520]  most people can't watch Harari.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:22.520]  And I can tell you,
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.520]  my Christian friends and,
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.520]  and relatives in close circles
[01:53:26.520 --> 01:53:28.520]  say they can't look at them
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:30.520]  because he is a demon.
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:31.520]  Yeah.
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:33.520]  He is a representation of evil.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.520]  They are definitely making a run
[01:53:34.520 --> 01:53:36.520]  in humanity right now.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:38.520]  With the pedophilia and the open borders
[01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:40.520]  and the currency evaluation.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:42.520]  We just have to mobilize and say no to it.
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:44.520]  But I'm going to say this again.
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:46.520]  If you go to online health now,
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:49.520]  that's one word online health now.com.
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:51.520]  There are so many great telephonic medicine
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:52.520]  and so many groups out there,
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:54.520]  but you're with heavy hitters.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.520]  You are the platinum standard of this.
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:57.520]  And I'm so excited.
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:58.520]  For people to call in,
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:00.520]  get real medical help,
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:01.520]  real prescriptions,
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:03.520]  real diagnoses,
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:05.520]  online health now.com.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.520]  Speak a little bit more about that.
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:08.520]  Well, I'm very proud to be the
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:09.520]  chief scientific officer
[01:54:09.520 --> 01:54:10.520]  for the wellness company.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:12.520]  I took that board position
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.520]  led by e-commerce juggernaut
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.520]  from Canada, Foster Colson.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.520]  Just had a exclusive interview
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:19.520]  on Tucker Carlson.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:21.520]  Very dynamic young man
[01:54:21.520 --> 01:54:23.520]  who's really making it happen.
[01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:25.520]  Open for business now and growing.
[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.520]  Taking on doctors, other healthcare providers
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:29.520]  on the platform.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.520]  But very importantly,
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:33.520]  people sign up for a very low monthly fee
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:34.520]  and they get the access.
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:36.520]  They get the on demand that they want.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:38.520]  We will never have another ivermectin
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:41.520]  or hydroxychloroquine prescription blocked ever.
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:43.520]  And again, credit goes to Trump.
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:45.520]  He greenlit all this medical stuff.
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:47.520]  Some was good, some was bad.
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:48.520]  The Regeneron was good.
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.520]  You know, he promoted vitamin D,
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:53.520]  vitamin C, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.520]  I mean, he was just saying,
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.520]  I trust the doctors do it,
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.520]  but trusting doctors of America
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:58.520]  getting that law passed
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.520]  before you guys couldn't do this.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:01.520]  It's true.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:04.520]  So he enabled the enablement of telemedicine
[01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.520]  and to give Trump credit,
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:08.520]  I think Trump has always had an eye
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:09.520]  for therapeutics.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:11.520]  He was incredibly undermined
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.520]  by the White House Task Force,
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.520]  the head of the National Immunology
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:20.520]  Allergy Division, Dr. Anthony Fauci.
[01:55:20.520 --> 01:55:22.520]  There were so many in the deep state,
[01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:25.520]  Alex, who are responsible for this catastrophe
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:26.520]  that happened.
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:28.520]  I estimate now that,
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:30.520]  of course, there was a learning curve
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:31.520]  on how we did this,
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:35.520]  that two-thirds of 10 million hospitalizations
[01:55:35.520 --> 01:55:38.520]  and two-thirds of a million lives lost
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:39.520]  could have been spared
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:42.520]  if we would have had the doctors
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:44.520]  be able to step into action
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.520]  and save America.
[01:55:45.520 --> 01:55:47.520]  And now it's happening with online health.
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:49.520]  Now, the wellness company,
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:51.520]  you seem more empowered than ever.
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:53.520]  Their attacks haven't worked on you.
[01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:55.520]  Don't let attacks on Dr. Peter McCullough
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:57.520]  make you as a doctor or a scientist.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:55:58.520]  Shut up.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:55:59.520]  We're winning.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:00.520]  We've been vindicated.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:01.520]  And I don't see in closing
[01:56:01.520 --> 01:56:03.520]  how the power structure recovers from this.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.520]  I know Trudeau and Canada is talking about
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.520]  new lockdowns.
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:07.520]  We don't take shots.
[01:56:07.520 --> 01:56:09.520]  I know they're talking about new lockdowns in Australia.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:11.520]  I know that China is the model.
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:12.520]  They're still in their lockdowns.
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:14.520]  This is their new governance model,
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.520]  which is how they bring in the QR codes,
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:18.520]  universal basic income,
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.520]  the social credit score,
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.520]  the carbon tax.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:22.520]  This is their big assault.
[01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:23.520]  This is the big issue.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:26.520]  And COVID is just the shoehorn
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.520]  or the foot in the door
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:31.520]  to the beachhead.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:33.520]  It appears to be the case.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:35.520]  And the world is looking at America
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:38.520]  as really the battleground for this.
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.520]  The battleground between totalitarianism
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.520]  and freedom.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:43.520]  And if there's one thing Americans
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:45.520]  can galvanize around is freedom.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.520]  I think there's elections coming up.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:49.520]  Alex on Tuesday are going to be absolutely pivotal
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:51.520]  in terms of a shift.
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:53.520]  Every candidate ought to come out
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:55.520]  and tell Americans where they stand on health freedom,
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:56:57.520]  where they stand on freedom of choice,
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.520]  where they stand on these vaccines,
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.520]  lockdowns, masking and other things.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:03.520]  That's, I think, the issue on the table.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.520]  What you just said is so huge.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:06.520]  We have the most draconian pushes
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:07.520]  for mandatory shots
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:09.520]  and targeting six-month-olds and up
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:12.520]  and trying to make school kids take them
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:15.520]  and just ridiculous mandates.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:17.520]  But we have the biggest awakening against it as well.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:19.520]  It is so true.
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:21.520]  And so many times this is what it takes,
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:24.520]  a time of crisis where great people rise forward.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:26.520]  I mentioned many of them.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.520]  The reason why this is so important
[01:57:28.520 --> 01:57:30.520]  is because the rest of the world is looking at America.
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:34.520]  There are countries so far down the road on this.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:36.520]  And Australia comes to mind.
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:38.520]  Canada, New Zealand.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:39.520]  Italy.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.520]  Italy.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:43.520]  This is extraordinary that we have an opportunity
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:46.520]  to turn the tables before things get worse.
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:48.520]  A lot of instability in Brazil right now
[01:57:48.520 --> 01:57:50.520]  with Bolsonaro.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:51.520]  Oh, they definitely stole that.
[01:57:51.520 --> 01:57:53.520]  I mean, that's it.
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:56.520]  If they can't set the precedent now with this,
[01:57:56.520 --> 01:57:57.520]  they're going to lose.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:59.520]  I mean, this is their full assault.
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:00.520]  It's true.
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:02.520]  And people ask, you know, who are these people?
[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.520]  What is in their mindset?
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:05.520]  And we mentioned what we think
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:08.520]  the biopharmaceutical complex, people at the top.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.520]  But how could the human mind become so distorted?
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.520]  Not everybody's getting kickbacks on this.
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:16.520]  Not everybody's getting their pockets filled.
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:19.520]  But the human mind is not thinking correctly.
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:21.520]  It's mob psychology.
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:22.520]  Yeah.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:24.520]  And it's basically, I think there is some truth
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:25.520]  to mass formation.
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:27.520]  You know, there's a lot of discussion.
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:29.520]  Is it a PSI-OP?
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:31.520]  And I think the answer is yes.
[01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:33.520]  I have a stack of articles I didn't even get to.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:35.520]  Military groups admit that it's a PSI-OP.
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:38.520]  It is a PSI-OP, a psychological operation on the people.
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:41.520]  But the psychopathology that's happening
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:44.520]  from person to person is mass formation.
[01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:45.520]  No, I agree.
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:47.520]  I mean, it's a mix of all of them, absolutely.
[01:58:47.520 --> 01:58:49.520]  So, again, onlinehealthnow.com,
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:52.520]  onlinehealthnow.com, check it out, folks,
[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.520]  and move away from the power structure,
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:56.520]  the CREP system, you know, Dr. Peter McCullough,
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:58:58.520]  who we should champion and support
[01:58:58.520 --> 01:59:00.520]  and lift up as the example,
[01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:02.520]  like the Elon Musk of medicine,
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:04.520]  to build our new system, our new world,
[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:06.520]  our new Atlantis.
[01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:08.520]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:09.520]  Thank you.
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:10.520]  Incredible that you came to town.
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:12.520]  We really appreciate you, and God bless you,
[01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:13.520]  Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:14.520]  Thank you.
[01:59:14.520 --> 01:59:15.520]  All right, folks, I'm going to come back
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.520]  with some final news stories and close this out.
[01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:20.520]  In an excerpt of that bombshell interview from now,
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:22.520]  12 years ago of Alan Watt,
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:24.520]  where he predicted the whole Great Reset
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:25.520]  and the new Elulder.
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:26.520]  He died a few years ago,
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:29.520]  but there's a multi-hour interview we did with him years ago,
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:31.520]  which now resurfaces going viral.
[01:59:31.520 --> 01:59:33.520]  It's also posted at infowars.com for free.
[01:59:33.520 --> 01:59:35.520]  We're going to air an excerpt of it coming back.
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:37.520]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:59:37.520 --> 01:59:41.520]  I'm pointing my finger at you,
[01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:43.520]  and I'm also pointing it right back at myself.
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:45.520]  You forget to take your multivitamins.
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:47.520]  You forget to take your vitamin D3.
[01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:49.520]  You forget to take your Brain Force Plus.
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.520]  You forget to take DNA Force Plus.
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:53.520]  You forget to take DX3,
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.520]  and you know it makes your life better,
[01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:56.520]  and you know it makes you healthier,
[01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:57.520]  and you constantly forget,
[01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:59.520]  and when you remember to do it, you're a lot healthier.
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:01.520]  This stuff will blow you away,

[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:05.520]  We have the biggest settle of the year going right now

[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.520]  This is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:42.520]  Right now, I got a few words for some of our brothers
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:44.520]  and sisters in the occupied zone.
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:46.520]  The chair is against the wall.
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:48.520]  John has a long mustache.
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:51.520]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:54.520]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory,
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:57.520]  and for all of you out there on or behind the lines,
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.520]  this is your song.
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:17.520]  What a transmission this evening.
[02:01:17.520 --> 02:01:19.520]  I just hope everybody shares the live link,
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:22.520]  and I hope you share the archive that will be posted soon
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:24.520]  at Bandai Video.
[02:01:24.520 --> 02:01:27.520]  Dr. Peter McCullough, all the information we've covered
[02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:31.520]  is simply amazing, but I wanted to go back to a guy
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:34.520]  that was just so well researched and so amazing,
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:36.520]  who's gone on to be with the Lord.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:38.520]  That's Alan Watt here in just a moment,
[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:42.520]  and then we're going to re-stream this until 4 p.m. tomorrow
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:44.520]  under the live Sunday show,
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:46.520]  but I hope you'll join us for it,
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:48.520]  and I hope that you will share.
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:51.520]  But separately, I knew that Dr. Peter McCullough
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:53.520]  was doing this a few months ago,
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:56.520]  so I've been approached by a lot of telephonic medicine
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.520]  and groups, and I was waiting until they actually launched it.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.520]  He didn't even want to talk about it today when he was on,
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:04.520]  but this is revolution, funding independent healthcare,
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:06.520]  funding patriots, funding groups
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:09.520]  that'll actually give you therapeutic care during an emergency.
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:13.520]  Go to one group that will actually give you the care you need,
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:16.520]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.520]  OnlineHealthNow.com.

[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:23.520]  Have your subscriber that's just posted constantly
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:29.520]  and then all the products and medical advice you need to get
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:32.520]  and just everything right there in one spot.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.520]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:37.520]  All right, I'm going to end this transmission.
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:39.520]  A lot of those I didn't get to, a lot I will get to
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:42.520]  tomorrow night, 4 p.m. Central.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:44.520]  I want to thank the crew for the great job they've done.
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:47.520]  Here's an excerpt of the two-plus hour breakdown
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.520]  that's on Band-Aid video right now
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:52.520]  late, late Alan Watts.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:57.520]  I'm Alan Watts and I'm an author and researcher
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:00.520]  into geopolitics, really, and history.
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.520]  I follow where the world has been.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:05.520]  The techniques were used to bring them to those stages
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.520]  and I plan them to where we are today
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:10.520]  and where, how the future is planned.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.520]  I've researched so many books.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:14.520]  I've got a library of my own.
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.520]  I like paperback books or at least hardback books
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:20.520]  because they're permanent records of the past
[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:22.520]  and if you can't understand the past,
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:24.520]  you understand the present or the future.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.520]  I've also been in the music business
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:29.520]  heavily involved for years
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:32.520]  and I saw how culture and creation
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:35.520]  worked from the top
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.520]  and how generations were swayed
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:40.520]  into new fashions, new ideas.
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.520]  I've been following the histories
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:44.520]  of what's now called the New World Order
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:47.520]  for many, many years
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:50.520]  and I tried to go into the books
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:52.520]  written by the big players,
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:54.520]  the technocrats themselves,
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:03:57.520]  those famous people like the Kissinger's,
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:03:59.520]  the Brzezinski's and so on,
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:02.520]  the Huxleys, the Lord Bertrand Russell's
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:06.520]  who all worked for the same organizations
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:08.520]  and I came to the conclusion, really,
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.520]  there was only one big organization
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:13.520]  with many sub-categories.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:16.520]  These boys tended to publish the world
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:19.520]  that they saw coming into view
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:21.520]  and they wrote it in their own hand basically.
[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:24.520]  They told us where they were taking the world
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:26.520]  and when you start studying these things
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:29.520]  about the age of 14, 15 or even younger
[02:04:29.520 --> 02:04:32.520]  and reading their books and you live long enough,
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:35.520]  you will see that the world has turned out exactly
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:37.520]  as they planned.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:40.520]  This can't be coincidence
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:43.520]  and who can really write up a wish list
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:45.520]  and make it happen globally,
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:48.520]  unless there is an organization,
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:51.520]  very, very powerful, probably the only organization
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:53.520]  really on the planet,
[02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:56.520]  an organization that can fund all sides,
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:59.520]  all oppositions and using the synthesis
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:02.520]  of conflicting parties,
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:05.520]  they can literally make the world come into view
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:07.520]  as they planned.
[02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:10.520]  They plan in centuries and the astonishing thing
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:13.520]  is when you go into the United Nations,
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:16.520]  which was loosely based on the Soviet system,
[02:05:16.520 --> 02:05:19.520]  they plan certain parts of their agenda
[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:23.520]  in 50-year plans, some in 100-year plans
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:26.520]  and some even in 150-year plans
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.520]  for different aspects of it.
[02:05:28.520 --> 02:05:30.520]  The Russells, the Huxleys and so on,
[02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:33.520]  Brzezinski's also use the same terminology
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:35.520]  with their long-term plans
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.520]  and you've got to understand too
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.520]  that nothing in culture comes out from the grassroots.
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:44.520]  Even Plato talked about that thousands of years ago.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:47.520]  He said that if it was a grassroots movement
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:50.520]  really coming from the people,
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:53.520]  then those in charge, the dominant minority,
[02:05:53.520 --> 02:05:55.520]  would lose control.
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:57.520]  Therefore, every change in culture,
[02:05:57.520 --> 02:05:59.520]  right down to fashion and music,
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:02.520]  and this was written 2,300 years ago,
[02:06:02.520 --> 02:06:05.520]  had to be authorized from the top and promoted from the top
[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:10.520]  if it fitted with the continuance of control over the public.
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:14.520]  And these are sciences which were taught down through the ages,
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:17.520]  are still taught today to the big players
[02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:20.520]  and they've used it to the full in the 20th century,
[02:06:20.520 --> 02:06:22.520]  now into the 21st century
[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:26.520]  with the use of television, mass communications, radio, etc.
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:28.520]  Everything has been given to us
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:32.520]  for the appropriate time and stage in the actual planning.
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:37.520]  And for those who are coming into this kind of study,
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:40.520]  it's best to go into the books, as I say, written by
[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.520]  the big players themselves.
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:44.520]  They love to boast.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:46.520]  Kissinger's got lots of books out there.
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:48.520]  So has Brzezinski.
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:51.520]  These are probably two of the master players in geopolitics
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:54.520]  trying to stay away from all the conspiracy books.
[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:58.520]  And they're also put out there on purpose, very fascinating books.
[02:06:58.520 --> 02:07:03.520]  But the legion circles forever without giving you the overall picture
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:07.520]  to the fact that every generation has a purpose
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.520]  up until this present time.
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:13.520]  And in a post-industrial era, these big boys have decided,
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:17.520]  and their masters too, that we are simply superfluous
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.520]  and they no longer need us.
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:24.520]  Hence, we have big foundations coming forward
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:27.520]  and organizations like the Optimum Population Trust
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:30.520]  who have decided to come out openly
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:34.520]  and demand that government start radically reducing the populations.
[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:39.520]  We are now the useless eaters, as Lord Breton Russell called us.
[02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:44.520]  Our ideas, our opinions on everything, our worldview,
[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:46.520]  even to do with population,
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:49.520]  and the fake view that we're overpopulated
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:52.520]  is all projected to us by the mainstream media
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:55.520]  working in concert for their masters.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:59.520]  And we begin to parrot what we hear through repetition.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:00.520]  And that's so important.
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:05.520]  It's repetition with slogans and catchphrases.
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:07.520]  And once you hear it happening in your own local group,
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:10.520]  your milieu, then you know it's working.
[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:14.520]  And the camera can make anything appear to be true.
[02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:16.520]  You'll see that in India, for instance,
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:20.520]  they always use the same streets of Bombay
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:23.520]  to make you think that you're massively overcrowded,
[02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:26.520]  and that's the impression people think of the entire Indian continent.
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:30.520]  The Indian continent is huge with thousands and thousands of miles
[02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:33.520]  of forest where no one lives.
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:36.520]  It's the same in Africa too.
[02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:40.520]  China, being the model state for the world, for instance,
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:45.520]  put into effect the United Nations policy to the extreme
[02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:47.520]  with its population reduction
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:51.520]  and the movements of people off of the rural areas into cities.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:53.520]  They started that years ago.
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:57.520]  Right now, they're in the process of moving 200 million more people off
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:09:00.520]  into the major cities, and that's the major newspapers.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:03.520]  The cities appear to be crowded
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:05.520]  because everyone's being moved into them.
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:11.520]  In the Western world since the 1950s, again under the term
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:14.520]  of urban sprawl and stopping urban sprawl,
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:17.520]  the Western countries also signed agreements
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:22.520]  to do no more building in the outskirts and off of major cities.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:27.520]  All existing buildings have to be used or else not done
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:29.520]  replaced with even higher ones.
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:33.520]  But regardless with the immigration and the free flow of people now
[02:09:33.520 --> 02:09:38.520]  from third world countries, the Western countries appear to be overcrowded.
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:43.520]  And yet the UN's own statistic show and sort of the national census show
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:47.520]  that the Europeans, for instance, Canadians and Americans
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:52.520]  who have been here for a couple of hundred years are actually in decline.
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:57.520]  So the overpopulation problem is simply an image projected by the media
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.520]  as more and more people are crammed into the same cities
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:03.520]  and they bring more immigrants into film.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:07.520]  But I also realized the system of schooling when I was going to school
[02:10:07.520 --> 02:10:12.520]  was bogus. The histories were bogus and I was very, very lucky
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:18.520]  to have access to very old libraries, very old libraries, time libraries.
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:24.520]  Some of them had reference books going back into the 1700s, written at the time.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:28.520]  When you compared the histories I was being taught in school
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:32.520]  to the histories that were written at the time, they were completely different.
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:38.520]  You had a deeper understanding of how geopolitics had been used in the past
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:41.520]  to even populate the country of Canada.
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:46.520]  London couldn't get immigrants to go off into the new colonies.
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:50.520]  What they did for Australia was to create so many laws
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:53.520]  that you couldn't help but break them and poverty
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:56.520]  and therefore stealing a loaf of bread to feed you or your family
[02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:00.520]  would get you deported to Australia with your family.
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:03.520]  That's how they populated Australia, crime.
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:05.520]  They created the laws for crime.
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:09.520]  With Scotland, they had a rebellion which could have been rigged
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:13.520]  and I often think it was, and the whole of Scotland was punished
[02:11:13.520 --> 02:11:17.520]  and they deported millions of the Scots off to the Americas
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:19.520]  to populate the Americas.
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:23.520]  This is geopolitics in action. That's how it works.
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:27.520]  And whole peoples are often moved from their land
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:32.520]  because the elite masters want them elsewhere to be productive
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:35.520]  for them themselves, the masters.
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:39.520]  When you look at the strategy for the US and Canada,
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:43.520]  again long-term strategy, long-term planning,
[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:47.520]  you'll find that the big corporations of their day,
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:50.520]  the Hudson's Bay companies, the Fraser companies,
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:55.520]  were given charters to own the land before Canada was Canada
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:57.520]  or US was the US.
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:11:59.520]  They were simply called the Americas.
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.520]  These were private international corporations
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:05.520]  that had the power of life and death
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:08.520]  over everyone who lived within their areas.
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:12.520]  The Queen or the King had a consulate in every country,
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:15.520]  Lieutenant General or Governor General in the column.
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:19.520]  We still have one in Canada today who represents the Queen.
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:23.520]  We have all the powers over life and death of subjects
[02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:26.520]  under that Governor.
[02:12:26.520 --> 02:12:29.520]  How these stopped rebellion in the past
[02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:32.520]  was to give us an idea of what they called democracy.
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:35.520]  They knew from the Chartist movement in Britain,
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:37.520]  for instance, and elsewhere in other countries,
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:40.520]  people were demanding rights for the first time.
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:44.520]  And so once again, they gave us champions to speak on our behalf,
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:48.520]  which calmed the people down thinking for the first time in history
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:52.520]  that the people were involved in their own destiny creation
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:54.520]  and nothing was further from the truth.
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:58.520]  Because the planners knew that once you bring people into a country
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:01.520]  or a consulate, create real wealth for them
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.520]  and get businesses going, clear the land, drain the swamps,
[02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:08.520]  and so on, they can take it all away from you through laws
[02:13:08.520 --> 02:13:10.520]  200 years down the road.
[02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:13.520]  And that's what's happening now.
[02:13:13.520 --> 02:13:16.520]  Long-term geopolitics once more.
[02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:18.520]  And if you think I'm kidding about this,
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.520]  go into the history books written at the time.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:22.520]  They're still there in some of the libraries.
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:25.520]  And you can also go into the art of geopolitics.
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:28.520]  There's even videos on YouTube on Brzezinski
[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:33.520]  boasting about how he set up the Taliban in Afghanistan.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:36.520]  You'll see him encourage them to fight the Soviets
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:39.520]  at that time in the 1970s.
[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:43.520]  And he actually says, yours is a holy war.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:46.520]  This man, who obviously believes in nothing but himself
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:49.520]  and his own peer group, is encouraging another people
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:51.520]  to go and fight a holy war that he had.
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:54.520]  And he uses these terms against the Soviets.
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:58.520]  Knowing full well, once it was set up and it was backed by the CIA,
[02:13:58.520 --> 02:14:02.520]  that 10, 15 years down the road, they'd be a problem.
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:05.520]  And then they'd have to go to war with a very group
[02:14:05.520 --> 02:14:07.520]  that created to fight the Soviets.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:09.520]  That's what's happening today.
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:11.520]  Long-term strategies.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:15.520]  Well, that's how history has always been run.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:19.520]  If you can go into the books where you find the British Home Office
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:23.520]  is mentioned, study the history of the diplomatic corps.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:27.520]  Because the diplomats were spies.
[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:30.520]  They would go into territory, set up embassies,
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:33.520]  collect intelligence data for future invasions.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:35.520]  Their job was also to try and grab the rights
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:39.520]  of minerals, gold, silver, et cetera, across the planet.
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:43.520]  All natural resources and find ways, long-term strategy
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:47.520]  to either bribe it off the present rulers of those countries
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:51.520]  or else create an ultimate war with them
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:55.520]  and simply steal it under the guise of occupation.
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:58.520]  We're living through a stage today, as I say,
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:01.520]  where this is all coming to a culmination.
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:03.520]  This is the post-industrial era.
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:08.520]  We're post-technical almost in the West.
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:11.520]  It's all done in other countries, all the technical stuff.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:16.520]  And Brzezinski himself talks about the technocratic era
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.520]  where the future will be for an elite
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:22.520]  with a highly trained bureaucracy underneath them
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.520]  and scientific elite
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:28.520]  who will not need the human labor that they've needed in the past.
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:32.520]  Human labor that is excessive and is unemployed
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:36.520]  and is hungry is now a threat to that established elite.
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:40.520]  So now they're doing something which they can only do
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:41.520]  to the human species.
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:43.520]  They don't need to do this with animals.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:46.520]  With animals, just go out and hunt them and kill them.
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.520]  We are the only species that has to be convinced
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:53.520]  to allow ourselves, for the good of all,
[02:15:53.520 --> 02:15:56.520]  to be sterilized and bring down the population
[02:15:56.520 --> 02:16:00.520]  through abortion on one end and euthanasia on the other
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:02.520]  under the guise to save the planet.
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:06.520]  And unfortunately with a massive propaganda campaigns
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:10.520]  that are all over media in every country at the same time
[02:16:10.520 --> 02:16:14.520]  with all the big foundations backing them with unlimited financing.
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:18.520]  Remember the two, the foundations are owned
[02:16:18.520 --> 02:16:22.520]  by the international bankers themselves.
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:24.520]  Then they can pull all of this off
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:27.520]  and unfortunately it really is working.
[02:16:27.520 --> 02:16:30.520]  In kindergarten now, you walk into kindergarten
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:32.520]  anywhere in Europe or America's
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:36.520]  and you'll see the rainbow inside every single one of them.
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:38.520]  You'll see all the terms about the world.
[02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:40.520]  Here's the globe, we're all global.
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:43.520]  And you'll see the greeting messages everywhere, everywhere.
[02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:46.520]  And how sacrifice will have to be made
[02:16:46.520 --> 02:16:48.520]  to save the world and the planet
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:51.520]  and future generations of society.
[02:16:51.520 --> 02:16:53.520]  Sacrifice.
[02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:57.520]  You tie that together with the institutions
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:01.520]  that were comprised of the Fabian society
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:04.520]  as a member of the Royal Institute for International Affairs
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:06.520]  as one society.
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.520]  The Council on Foreign Relations is also the same thing
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:12.520]  as the Royal Institute for International Affairs.
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:15.520]  They are what Thatcher and Professor Carla
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:18.520]  quickly called the parallel government.
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:21.520]  They have told us where the future is going to be.
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:23.520]  Some of their members have even written books
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:26.520]  about the need to cull off massive amounts of the population
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:29.520]  by any means possible.
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:32.520]  And so we see this final stage being pushed
[02:17:32.520 --> 02:17:35.520]  as they convince us that we are the problem.
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:38.520]  The Club of Rome that also belongs to the same group.
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:42.520]  In the 1990s, the two founders said
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:45.520]  that back in the 1970s at the Club of Rome,
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:48.520]  they were given the task as a premier think tank
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:50.520]  for the globe, this global society.
[02:17:50.520 --> 02:17:55.520]  The task to find ways of reducing the population
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:59.520]  and controlling the people to go along with this,
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:02.520]  convincing the public how to go along with it.
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:05.520]  And they said they looked at all possible means of doing so.
[02:18:05.520 --> 02:18:07.520]  What had worked before?
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:10.520]  Again, geopolitics, strategy.
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:14.520]  Under warfare conditions, the public will give up freedom.
[02:18:14.520 --> 02:18:18.520]  The public will be directed by governments, bureaucracies,
[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:21.520]  and police, military, etc.
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:25.520]  Under warfare, the public sacrifice, they'll have less food.
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:27.520]  They'll ration stuff.
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:29.520]  They go along with it to save themselves.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:32.520]  Therefore, they'd have to find a warfare strategy,
[02:18:32.520 --> 02:18:34.520]  a reason for war.
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:40.520]  And what they came up with was that man was the enemy of the planet.
[02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:45.520]  They said the idea that global warming could be created
[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:49.520]  and blamed upon mankind would fit the bill.
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:51.520]  These are the words they used.
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:55.520]  That would fit the bill, written in the 1970s,
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:58.520]  and decided that the think tanks, then,
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:02.520]  and published by the guys involved in a book
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:04.520]  called The First Global Revolution.
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:05.520]  Well worth reading.
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:08.520]  When they hit upon an idea from a premier think tank,
[02:19:08.520 --> 02:19:11.520]  they will never change that agenda.
[02:19:11.520 --> 02:19:14.520]  I've said before, it wouldn't matter if ruptured eyes and snow
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:18.520]  all year round, it will still stick to global warming.
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:20.520]  That's the agenda.
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:23.520]  Now, of course, they've changed it slightly to climate change,
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:26.520]  which simply means changes in the weather.
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:29.520]  And they're in the process now of convincing the general public
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:33.520]  to be afraid of summer, for instance.
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:38.520]  It's all done through the alteration and distortion of perceptions.
[02:19:38.520 --> 02:19:43.520]  Massive psychology is used on all of this.
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:49.520]  And they certainly understand mass psychology of the general public.
[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:51.520]  These boys don't simply announce things,
[02:19:51.520 --> 02:19:54.520]  or make up a wish list of the future,
[02:19:54.520 --> 02:19:57.520]  and send up the chimney to Santa Claus.
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:02.520]  When they come up with an idea, they implement it.
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:06.520]  I've followed the United Nations Department of Statistics
[02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:10.520]  as they announce every single year the sparement count
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:16.520]  of the western mail, which has been falling drastically since 1950s.
[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:21.520]  They say that it's down by about 75, 85 percent.
[02:20:21.520 --> 02:20:23.520]  Now, when something like that's happened
[02:20:23.520 --> 02:20:28.520]  across the whole of Europe and Americas in 50 years,
[02:20:28.520 --> 02:20:31.520]  and they suddenly started noticing it, 50 years ago,
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:36.520]  a sudden onset, and there's no crisis made about it.
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:41.520]  There's no comeback after announcing the statistics.
[02:20:41.520 --> 02:20:43.520]  They just tell you the cold, hard statistics
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:45.520]  and go off to the next statistic on some other topic.
[02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:47.520]  That means it's part of the agenda.
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:49.520]  Otherwise, it would be a crisis.
[02:20:49.520 --> 02:20:52.520]  If this wasn't planned and part of the agenda, believe me,
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.520]  it would be a crisis if they didn't authorize it.
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:21:01.520]  And now they tell us that the average American has less than 20 percent sperm
[02:21:01.520 --> 02:21:04.520]  and only about 15 percent is motile.
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:06.520]  That's not a coincidence.
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:09.520]  What happened in the 1950s to start out this ball rolling?
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:19.520]  In the 1950s, they suddenly put all the known female synthetic estrogens
[02:21:19.520 --> 02:21:21.520]  into food supply.
[02:21:21.520 --> 02:21:23.520]  They put it in baby foods.
[02:21:23.520 --> 02:21:25.520]  Procter and Gamble were the first one to admit
[02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:29.520]  after investigation 40 years later
[02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:33.520]  that they were using a rinse to supposedly sterilize the baby bottles.
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:38.520]  And it contained bisphenol A.
[02:21:38.520 --> 02:21:43.520]  An odd thing to rinse baby bottles with when bisphenol A
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:48.520]  is the very thing that attacks young male children at that age
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:51.520]  and stops the testes from developing properly.
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:21:54.520]  You go back even further into more detail
[02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:59.520]  and you find out that the cosmetic industry was using insufflatants.
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:05.520]  Insufflation is a technique where certain carriers are put into the creams themselves
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:11.520]  and these creams then absorb into the skin carrying other chemicals with them.
[02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:16.520]  They're almost like they carry the payloads into the target in the bloodstream.
[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:22.520]  We find that the women were highly toxic with the artificial bisphenol A
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:24.520]  and other ingredients.
[02:22:24.520 --> 02:22:29.520]  And therefore within the first 8 to 12 weeks of pregnancy with a male child
[02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:32.520]  there's a very good chance that male would grow up to be
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:38.520]  either almost completely sterile or to say maybe have some motile sperm.
[02:22:38.520 --> 02:22:41.520]  This was all understood 50 years ago.
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:45.520]  Bisphenol A for instance was discovered in the 1890s
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:50.520]  and the properties it had against humans, especially males, was known then too.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:55.520]  Now it's in all the beer cans, great target males again.
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:57.520]  They line the cans with it.
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:01.520]  There's been many exposés on it now.
[02:23:01.520 --> 02:23:05.520]  The CBC in Canada, which is a government owned television station,
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:08.520]  it's the BBC basically of Canada,
[02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:13.520]  did a documentary series called The Disappearing Male
[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:19.520]  and it goes through all of that in that particular talk with proof.
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:24.520]  So we go back to the writings of Lord Bertrand Russell and Julian Huxley
[02:23:24.520 --> 02:23:29.520]  and Aldo Huxley, who were also related to the Darwin's by the way.
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:35.520]  You'll find that they talked about ways to sterilize the populations
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:39.520]  in the 30s, 40s and 50s.
[02:23:39.520 --> 02:23:44.520]  But of course, and even said they would use the needle to create a compliance
[02:23:44.520 --> 02:23:49.520]  with the pliable population, meaning to dumb down the people
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.520]  and also to bring down the fertility rates.
[02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:59.520]  In the 1950s, across Europe and the Americas, what came out?
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:02.520]  Under vast promotion, what came out?
[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:05.520]  The polio vaccine came out.
[02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:10.520]  That was the first one ever to come out through a mass fear campaign,
[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:13.520]  a massive fear campaign.
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:17.520]  Polio was very, very rare.
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:21.520]  Yet if you go back to the old path, black and white newsreels,
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:24.520]  that they showed all over the world at the time,
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:28.520]  they showed you the same one boy in the iron lung
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:31.520]  and that terrified the whole world.
[02:24:31.520 --> 02:24:34.520]  How many polio cases were actually there?
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:36.520]  Was it really polio?
[02:24:36.520 --> 02:24:40.520]  We do know from those first shots, those injections,
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:46.520]  the generation that got them all, end up with carrying a hundred simian viruses.
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:53.520]  Live simian viruses in the shot and simian 40 only had one function
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.520]  according to the maker, the discoverer of the vaccine,
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:00.520]  and that was to cause cancer.
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:07.520]  And I also have a copy of the discussion with this particular man
[02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:10.520]  and his staff admitting that.
[02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:12.520]  They knew that at the time.
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:16.520]  What they said was they thought the risks outweighed the bad benefits
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:18.520]  that might come along down the road.
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:21.520]  That was their excuse.
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:25.520]  Since then, we've been trained to accept more and more inoculations
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:30.520]  until babies now get something like 30 inoculations before they're at the hospital.
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:34.520]  When you look into the big manufacturers of inoculations,
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:39.520]  like the Baxter Laboratories that were in the news recently
[02:25:39.520 --> 02:25:47.520]  because they sent out live flu virus along with the bird flu virus mixed together
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:51.520]  and were caught by another country who tested it on ferrets and the ferrets all died.
[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:55.520]  They had done the very thing that they say that they're worried about happening in nature
[02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:00.520]  where the common flu is mixed with a killer flu and becomes highly contagious.
[02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:05.520]  I actually did it by mistake, we're told, but go back into Baxter Laboratories even further
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:12.520]  and you'll find Baxter Laboratories was part of IG Farben Group in World War II.
[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:18.520]  They were responsible for creating chemicals and so on that were used as gas.
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:22.520]  And they were also used in other medical experiments on prisoners.
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:27.520]  That's in the records of the choir they went on into IG Farben.
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:31.520]  A good book to read is The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben.
[02:26:31.520 --> 02:26:36.520]  What does it mean when you read that a vitamin or a mineral is essential?
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:39.520]  Well, it means that without it you die.
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.520]  Without water you die on average in about five days.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:45.520]  Without food you die on average in about a month.
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:46.520]  But what's in the food?
[02:26:46.520 --> 02:26:49.520]  The vitamins and the minerals and the trace elements
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:53.520]  and the energy that your body needs to not just survive but thrive.
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.520]  And in this insane environment today, it is now more important than ever
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:00.520]  to boost your body's natural defenses.
[02:27:00.520 --> 02:27:07.520]  It's been sold out for months, it's back in stock, a very high quality, organic based multivitamin.
