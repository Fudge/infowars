[00:00.000 --> 00:04.760]  everything that they own away from. So this Paragon Foundation is absolutely dedicated
[00:04.760 --> 00:08.920]  to protecting those rights and protecting those properties that you have. And I don't
[00:08.920 --> 00:12.840]  know of another organization across the country that offers some of the things that we offer.
[00:12.840 --> 00:13.840]  I'm proud of it.
[00:13.840 --> 00:21.880]  So pick up the telephone and dial toll-free, 1-877-847-3443 and join the Paragon Foundation
[00:21.880 --> 00:30.040]  today, online at Paragon Foundation.
[00:30.040 --> 00:40.200]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:40.200 --> 00:47.240]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:47.240 --> 00:56.520]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:56.520 --> 01:08.160]  We're going to have wide-open phones today. It is the 26th of February, 2007. We've almost
[01:08.160 --> 01:13.960]  exhausted the second month of 2007.
[01:13.960 --> 01:19.320]  As we fight the New World Order toe-to-toe in mortal combat for this Republic.
[01:19.320 --> 01:25.040]  All right. Big broadcast lined up today. Wide-open phones. We only have one guest joining us from
[01:25.040 --> 01:29.760]  the Project for New American Citizen briefly at the bottom of the next hour to talk about
[01:29.760 --> 01:36.720]  how 9-11 Truth went out last Friday to confront Barack Obama. And they basically took the
[01:36.720 --> 01:42.280]  little speech over with a giant banner. And there were several other signs in the crowd
[01:42.280 --> 01:46.400]  and the media was flipping them off and cussing at them and getting extremely mad. It did
[01:46.400 --> 01:52.080]  make the news. But several of the other newscasts shot him from weird angles so that the signs
[01:52.080 --> 01:58.200]  wouldn't be evident. And then the Project for New American Citizens, a local UT group,
[01:58.200 --> 02:03.400]  went out yesterday to the destruction of the Intel building that never got completed when
[02:03.400 --> 02:10.280]  Intel pulled out of Austin in 1999 during the dot-com bust. It's going to be a new super-federal
[02:10.280 --> 02:15.560]  command bunker. I guess you could call it a globalist embassy. That's all these federal
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.160]  command centers are, are to basically command and control the enslavement, the tracking,
[02:20.160 --> 02:24.000]  the domination, the destruction of the country. They're going to build one of those there,
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.040]  but they blew up the old Intel building, the husk of it, and they couldn't even blow it
[02:30.040 --> 02:34.840]  up. Controlled demolitions, planted for weeks. I can't believe I hadn't heard about it.
[02:34.840 --> 02:38.600]  I got back to town yesterday. I went out of town for a few days with a family. But we
[02:38.600 --> 02:43.440]  did have some folks down there with cameras, I'm told, and the PNAC boys. And I can't
[02:43.440 --> 02:47.520]  wait to see that footage. We did see it on the news, and they bombed it with controlled
[02:47.520 --> 02:52.680]  demolitions and couldn't bring it down. And then that happens, I'm told, about one time
[02:52.680 --> 02:59.400]  out of 10. So even when you have precision and have weeks to plant the bombs, it's hard
[02:59.400 --> 03:07.360]  to bring them down. But Fire magically did it on Tower 12 and 7 on 9-11. We have the
[03:07.360 --> 03:15.840]  NIST engineer later that I'm going to be getting to. In fact, they played this clip when PNAC
[03:15.840 --> 03:21.720]  put on. The big speech I gave at UT to a packed house of over 900 people, over 100 turned
[03:21.720 --> 03:26.360]  away, it was a great event. Again, they're so active. This is exactly the type of leadership
[03:26.360 --> 03:30.760]  we need against the globalist. They played this clip before my speech and coming up later,
[03:30.760 --> 03:38.160]  we'll play the head of NIST, National Institute of Standards and Technology, saying there
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.080]  was no molten steel, but then we played video of the molten steel and video firefighters
[03:42.080 --> 03:45.680]  saying there was molten steel. And then have him saying they didn't even do any scientific
[03:45.680 --> 03:50.800]  investigation because they know it would cause it to collapse. Pretty amazing we'll be playing
[03:50.800 --> 03:57.440]  that when one of the PNAC gentlemen joins us, Project for New American Citizen, kind of
[03:57.440 --> 04:04.400]  a pun on Project for New American Century. Huge Oklahoma City developments at the end
[04:04.400 --> 04:08.920]  of the week and over the weekend we now have portions of the sealed federal documents that
[04:08.920 --> 04:14.600]  have been unsealed. Huge reports up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now. We'll be going
[04:14.600 --> 04:21.720]  over that in the second hour as well. In the meantime, Friday they met and we have the
[04:21.720 --> 04:25.880]  aftermath of it as well as a Ludobs report that will analyze this out of the Canadian
[04:25.880 --> 04:32.520]  Free Press. North American political leaders meet in Ottawa this time for a public SPP
[04:32.520 --> 04:38.960]  meeting. We'll be breaking it down and going over their deceptions. The White House is
[04:38.960 --> 04:43.760]  gearing up for an attack on Iran. Headline U.S. generals will quit a Bush orders Iran
[04:43.760 --> 04:50.640]  attack. American Armada prepares to take on Iran. U.S. funds terror groups to sow chaos
[04:50.640 --> 04:56.240]  in Iran. These are all mainstream headlines. U.S. funds terror groups to sow chaos in
[04:56.240 --> 05:01.440]  Iran. U.S. forces in Iraq say they found more Iranian-made weapons, but the thing they announced
[05:01.440 --> 05:08.680]  three weeks ago turned out to be a fraud. This is probably another fraud. Also, report
[05:08.680 --> 05:14.360]  three Gulf states agree to IAF overflights in route to Iran for an attack. Democrats
[05:14.360 --> 05:21.480]  reinforce war on terrorism live. Iran fired a research rocket and they tried to claim
[05:21.480 --> 05:28.920]  it was a weapon the media did. Our troops left to suffer in these mortuaries that double
[05:28.920 --> 05:39.800]  as VA hospitals. It's all coming up today. Masters of news and info. It's here after
[05:39.800 --> 05:45.080]  a year in production and traveling the distant lands. My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[05:45.080 --> 05:48.480]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[05:48.480 --> 05:53.680]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them. Terror Storm
[05:53.680 --> 05:58.920]  proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried
[05:58.920 --> 06:02.960]  out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in
[06:02.960 --> 06:09.360]  Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture,
[06:09.360 --> 06:13.960]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive guide
[06:13.960 --> 06:18.800]  to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes. Terror
[06:18.800 --> 06:23.520]  Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get your copy

[06:38.880 --> 06:43.720]  but would you be prepared during an accident? During nuclear disasters, great amounts of
[06:43.720 --> 06:50.000]  radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[06:50.000 --> 06:54.560]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most
[06:54.560 --> 06:59.440]  feared consequence of a nuclear accident. Radioactive poisoning. Potassium iodate can
[06:59.440 --> 07:05.080]  protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine. This shields
[07:05.080 --> 07:10.120]  the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine. Potassium
[07:10.120 --> 07:15.560]  iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs
[07:15.560 --> 07:21.680]  in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets. Order the official potassium iodate for only
[07:21.680 --> 07:30.920]  $24 and save $5 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438. Call now and get pre-shipping.
[07:30.920 --> 07:37.520]  That's 888-803-4438. How are you feeling today? I asked because

[08:34.960 --> 08:42.960]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:42.960 --> 08:49.520]  Alright, since we interviewed the lawyer who went and interviewed Terry Nichols, one
[08:49.520 --> 08:54.680]  of the supposed co-conspirators in the Oklahoma City bombing, there have been major new developments
[08:54.680 --> 08:58.960]  that is coming up at the start of the next hour. We'll also have wide open phones throughout
[08:58.960 --> 09:05.320]  three hours today. We've gotten sealed federal documents, portions of them now unsealed. We
[09:05.320 --> 09:13.000]  broke that Friday on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and a special report is out today
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.080]  on it. Target Iran is really heating up. The preparations are getting clearer and clearer
[09:19.080 --> 09:24.560]  with Israel making preparations to go ahead and strike the Islamic State. We will be going
[09:24.560 --> 09:31.560]  over that for you. Also, a bunch of really important big brother on steroids news and
[09:31.560 --> 09:35.920]  a ton of clips that we're going to be covering on a host of issues, including a 60 minutes
[09:35.920 --> 09:41.000]  piece I want to break down and analyze several clips from where they interviewed soldiers
[09:41.000 --> 09:47.200]  last night who were current enlisted soldiers who were decrying the war. You'd think it
[09:47.200 --> 09:52.880]  was anti-war, but only to a certain level, so we'll analyze and decipher this propaganda
[09:52.880 --> 10:00.840]  as well. But let me tackle this now. I did take off Friday to go spend a couple days
[10:00.840 --> 10:05.040]  with my family. I basically have to just leave town to spend any time with my wife and children,
[10:05.040 --> 10:10.560]  so I do that every month or so. But I ended up working because I had to get online and
[10:10.560 --> 10:15.920]  read about the SPP meeting. I had to, of course, sit there and read lawsuits and declassified
[10:15.920 --> 10:22.840]  documents and unsealed federal records and I had to call lawyers and find out that indeed
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.160]  he had gotten the judge's authorization to release some of this. I'm not whining. I'm
[10:28.160 --> 10:33.760]  explaining why we're just now getting to this. We get so busy in this office that somehow
[10:33.760 --> 10:41.960]  only jonesreport.com covered in any way that the SPP was meeting on Friday. We learned
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.760]  of this with our guest on Thursday. It had just broken that day, but they were planning
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.520]  to have this meeting. It was done very covertly, but it was semi-public and some demonstrators
[10:52.520 --> 10:57.160]  did rush the stage and basically exposed the whole thing. As a fraud, they were there
[10:57.160 --> 11:03.880]  in Ottawa, seen of last year's Bilderberg Group meeting, basically trying to sell us
[11:03.880 --> 11:09.600]  on this North American Union. So let me go ahead and go through the best report I've
[11:09.600 --> 11:18.360]  seen of what? There's 10 different newspaper reports, several TV reports out of Canada,
[11:18.360 --> 11:24.320]  almost no news coverage in the United States other than Lou Dobbs on CNN Friday and that
[11:24.320 --> 11:31.120]  clip's coming up in just a few minutes. Headline, North American political leaders met in Ottawa.
[11:31.120 --> 11:40.720]  Now before I go any further, there are three leaders in cabinet positions of each nation
[11:40.720 --> 11:47.080]  that go and chair the governmental meeting. That is generally the Secretary of State or
[11:47.080 --> 11:51.840]  their counterpart in the other government. Like here, it's called Secretary of State
[11:51.840 --> 11:56.600]  and it's the same in Canada and Mexico, but then they have Homeland Security Director
[11:56.600 --> 12:03.880]  and then they call that Security Affairs in Canada, but it's the counterparts of the
[12:03.880 --> 12:07.360]  military, of Homeland Security and of the Secretary of State.
[12:07.360 --> 12:13.520]  Of the three governments, under the SPP documents that we were able to get via FOIA request
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.960]  that were released in January from the September meeting last year, the first agenda, go read
[12:18.960 --> 12:24.640]  it at judicialwatch.org. The first agenda was secrecy and how to keep the secret from
[12:24.640 --> 12:31.800]  the public and how to stop it from leaking. It did leak one individual who was there sworn
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.080]  to secrecy, a press reporter because they let in a few of them, tried to coopt him, refused
[12:36.080 --> 12:40.360]  to go along with it with a whistle. So we learned of the secret meeting with over 200
[12:40.360 --> 12:47.800]  CEOs and large delegations from each government. It was a governmental meeting setting policy.
[12:47.800 --> 12:54.880]  Secretly, remember the President signed this in March of 2005 with Fox and Martin of Mexico
[12:54.880 --> 13:02.400]  and Canada and the SPP agreement is still classified and FOIA request have been ignored
[13:02.400 --> 13:07.640]  under national security reasons. So Congress, when you call them and they say, we know nothing
[13:07.640 --> 13:13.040]  about it, some of them are telling the truth. I mean, most bills are not even read. In
[13:13.040 --> 13:20.720]  fact, our own downsized DC show that's on weekends here on Genesis, Mr. Babka, his
[13:20.720 --> 13:28.080]  main focus is trying to get legislation passed. He is a slash lobbyist is to make them have
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.160]  a law where they've got to read the bills. They passed 5,000 page bills. No one's read
[13:33.160 --> 13:38.320]  that the insurance companies or big pharma right or in the case of animal ID that's written
[13:38.320 --> 13:42.800]  up by Monsanto and a few others. They literally write the law, come in and give it to the
[13:42.800 --> 13:49.400]  politicians. It's not read, it's put into action. And then moron, dumb down, civil servants
[13:49.400 --> 13:57.480]  go out and enforce it. It's just off the charts. But I'm already digressing. The point is,
[13:57.480 --> 14:03.120]  when we read this, it's literally nothing but lies, but still the lies are so transparent
[14:03.120 --> 14:09.200]  this is a good article. It is 10 pages long from the Canadian Free Press, big national
[14:09.200 --> 14:17.600]  publication. Headline, American, North American political leaders meet in Ottawa. United States,
[14:17.600 --> 14:21.640]  Secretary of State Congress writes, chats with and shakes hands with Canadian Foreign
[14:21.640 --> 14:26.280]  Affairs Minister Peter McKay before they start the security and prosperity partnership meeting
[14:26.280 --> 14:33.440]  in Ottawa Friday, February 23rd, 2007. That's the photograph under it. This is by Jennifer
[14:33.440 --> 14:41.120]  Ditchburn. Top North American ministers deflected criticism that they had consulted only big
[14:41.120 --> 14:46.400]  businesses for their talks on trade and security rules suggesting Friday there are different
[14:46.400 --> 14:52.600]  venues for public interest in labor groups to raise their concerns and suggestions. This
[14:52.600 --> 14:57.680]  is because they had the secret meeting last year and literally the CEOs go in and then
[14:57.680 --> 15:05.120]  they basically have it all written up to aid them and aid in monopolies and consolidation.
[15:05.120 --> 15:10.680]  And we have the documents on that as well. And then suddenly every TV ad you see everything
[15:10.680 --> 15:17.800]  in the culture is Miss North America or oh, the new North American Excellence Award, GM
[15:17.800 --> 15:21.680]  Saturn, just everything's down. North America, North America, North American Union, North
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.360]  American integration. Now just suddenly they're all parroting it. They all get together, they
[15:25.360 --> 15:30.360]  go on the same page, they go out and push the agenda. It's all about consolidation,
[15:30.360 --> 15:34.880]  the opposite of free trade, the opposite of a free market, the opposite of middle classes,
[15:34.880 --> 15:39.200]  that is their sworn enemy. Let's continue. The security and prosperity
[15:39.200 --> 15:45.120]  partnership SVP is an ongoing dialogue between Canada, the United States and Mexico. Oh,
[15:45.120 --> 15:50.360]  it's a dialogue to find more common ground on issues ranging from border security to
[15:50.360 --> 15:55.720]  emergency preparedness. That's martial law. The group has an arm of business leaders that
[15:55.720 --> 16:02.520]  provides myriad recommendations. The CFR wrote up the SPP plan. In early 2005 it was
[16:02.520 --> 16:08.200]  implemented word for word from the documents we've gotten. So they write it up and it becomes
[16:08.200 --> 16:13.360]  law. Just like the Hart-Rubman Commission wrote up the plan for Homeland Security and
[16:13.360 --> 16:21.600]  their 51 recommendations have all been implemented. They wrote that up a year before 9-11. They
[16:21.600 --> 16:25.880]  get up on TV and they say we need to use this disaster for a new world order. They are the
[16:25.880 --> 16:29.600]  government. They write the laws and then it's given to Congress or the parliament and it's
[16:29.600 --> 16:34.480]  passed, period. No discussion. Or if the Congress won't pass it, they just have agreements and
[16:34.480 --> 16:40.800]  have the presidents get together and sign a secret agreement. It's just done anyways.
[16:40.800 --> 16:44.800]  The average cop on the street doesn't even know what the, say, Seventh Amendment is,
[16:44.800 --> 16:48.240]  so they'll go off and enforce it. There's no law there. Just like there's no law, you
[16:48.240 --> 16:52.240]  got to take vaccines. They'll still come snatch your children and feel good about it while
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.840]  they do it. The group has an arm of business leaders that provides myriad recommendations
[16:57.840 --> 17:03.400]  but has no form and formal mechanism for consulting the public at large. The first agenda was
[17:03.400 --> 17:07.800]  secrecy. Go read the World Net Daily article. It's the best one I've seen from January
[17:07.800 --> 17:12.480]  that boiled down the secret documents that were released under four year. Or go to your
[17:12.480 --> 17:18.520]  homework and read the hundreds of pages at judicialwatch.org.
[17:18.520 --> 17:24.800]  The SPP was struck by the leaders of the three countries in 2005 to enhance the continent's
[17:24.800 --> 17:30.400]  competitiveness. Oh, what's wrong with competitiveness? Just like NAFTA and GATT are so competitive.
[17:30.400 --> 17:36.200]  But for at least the first year to see little attention with their dry talk of regulations
[17:36.200 --> 17:43.720]  and cutting down on paperwork. Writing all the new regulations in secret. Recently, nationalist
[17:43.720 --> 17:47.400]  groups and politicians in Canada and the United States have raised alarm bells over the lack
[17:47.400 --> 17:53.920]  of formal consultation with either civil society or legislatures. And it continues, some of
[17:53.920 --> 17:58.480]  the issues ministers discussed during the meetings included finalizing a North American plan
[17:58.480 --> 18:02.800]  on dealing with flu pandemic and another for common regulatory environment in all three
[18:02.800 --> 18:09.280]  countries. So new environmental laws, environmental crime laws, environmental tax laws, fossil
[18:09.280 --> 18:20.280]  fuel tax, that was in the four year documents. This is just off the charts. And then notice
[18:20.280 --> 18:25.800]  if you go read the pandemic flu plans or the SARS plan or the anthrax plan from top off
[18:25.800 --> 18:32.800]  two and the dark winter drills they had in 2000, you will learn that it means foreign
[18:32.800 --> 18:38.880]  troops in all three countries from each other's nations and UN troops and mass quarantines.
[18:38.880 --> 18:45.280]  This is martial law. This is unifying their martial law grid. So some of the issues the
[18:45.280 --> 18:49.640]  ministers discussed during their meetings included finalizing a North American plan on dealing
[18:49.640 --> 18:54.320]  with a flu pandemic and another on a common regulatory environment in all three countries.
[18:54.320 --> 18:58.600]  Remember Army Times a few months ago reported, oh, if we're attacked by terrorists, yes,
[18:58.600 --> 19:03.200]  the Mexican troops will come into America. See, this is all part of that too. But North
[19:03.200 --> 19:10.000]  comms now over the whole North American continent. It continues, that could include common food
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.760]  safety rules. That means European style super stringent controls to consolidate, regulate
[19:15.760 --> 19:22.480]  animal ID, you name it. Listen to this, Canada currently has more stringent rules for fortified
[19:22.480 --> 19:27.520]  products. That means vitamins, Codex Alimentarius, restricting vitamins folks. See, there it
[19:27.520 --> 19:33.720]  is. Insiders say the value of the SPP is that it puts the weight of ministers and national
[19:33.720 --> 19:37.800]  leaders behind projects that might normally languish for years among bureaucrats. Well,
[19:37.800 --> 19:42.760]  when they say bureaucrats folks, they mean they're using the bureaucracies unelected to
[19:42.760 --> 19:49.920]  do this through executive power. This is actually shutting off the legislatures and the people
[19:49.920 --> 19:56.760]  and due process and the constitutions. So see, the average person reads that, oh, it gets
[19:56.760 --> 20:02.560]  rid of those bad bureaucrats. No, it puts the bureaucrats in command. The issue of public
[20:02.560 --> 20:06.800]  consultation was at least identified during their meetings and a final statement released
[20:06.800 --> 20:11.800]  by ministers, they said that they discussed the importance of transparency and communications
[20:11.800 --> 20:16.920]  with stakeholders in the public. No, in the four year request from last year's meeting,
[20:16.920 --> 20:23.440]  the first thing was how to keep it secret. Go read it. See, everything they say, it's
[20:23.440 --> 20:27.720]  the opposite. They say it's to stop bureaucrats. It puts the bureaucrats and the corporations
[20:27.720 --> 20:36.400]  in control. They say it's too, it's just incredible. We'll be right back.

[21:37.440 --> 21:45.520]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources, the real money folks. Let's review a few things
[21:45.520 --> 21:53.880]  from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004. The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300,
[21:53.880 --> 21:59.680]  a 5 percent increase. The dollars value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against
[21:59.680 --> 22:05.960]  the euro, a 24 percent decrease in spending power against the gold back euro. Gold has
[22:05.960 --> 22:12.640]  gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16 percent increase in real money. Precious metals are
[22:12.640 --> 22:18.040]  the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace. To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar,
[22:18.040 --> 22:26.720]  call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237. Remember gold is liquid, private and portable.

[24:36.400 --> 24:50.080]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation. It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[24:50.080 --> 24:54.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time. We're here live.
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.400]  Your calls are coming up the next segment. I'm going to play this short Lou Dobbs clip
[24:57.400 --> 25:02.320]  concerning the SPP muting. But let's go back to the Canadian Free Press and go over this
[25:02.320 --> 25:11.120]  report. This is so important. The issue of public consultation was at least identified
[25:11.120 --> 25:15.640]  during their meetings. In the final statement released by the ministers, this is last Friday,
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.840]  they said that they discussed the importance of transparency and communication with stakeholders
[25:20.840 --> 25:27.280]  and the public. We also heard the word common ground. This is all Delphi corporate technique
[25:27.280 --> 25:31.200]  developed in the 60s. This is where they tell you they're listening to you, but then you
[25:31.200 --> 25:36.200]  have absolutely no input. They just say they're listening to you. When you hear stakeholders,
[25:36.200 --> 25:43.200]  that means global corporations. Oh, they have a vote too. Yeah, they own the government.
[25:43.200 --> 25:48.520]  The NDP leader, Jack Layton, raised the issue during Friday's question period in the Commons.
[25:48.520 --> 25:53.120]  By the way, we do have this tape from C-Spanel to air any later in the week. The fact is
[25:53.120 --> 25:57.640]  these discussions were worrisome to all Canadians. They have been incredibly secret from the
[25:57.640 --> 26:03.400]  get-go, and there has been no public input. Repeat, no public input, Layton said. The
[26:03.400 --> 26:08.800]  government has not sought out the opinion of the parliamentarians. That's the elected
[26:08.800 --> 26:13.560]  representatives or the public on it. Of course, the conservatives think they know best. See,
[26:13.560 --> 26:16.920]  they make it a conservative liberal thing because it's the new conservative government.
[26:16.920 --> 26:21.800]  The liberal government did the same thing. The SPP's business arm. Oh, there's a business
[26:21.800 --> 26:27.120]  arm to the new government. No one elected the bureaucrats and the politicians were bought
[26:27.120 --> 26:34.680]  and paid for by the business arm, so it literally runs the show. Oh, the business arm. See, they
[26:34.680 --> 26:40.480]  have something to say. They're criticizing everyone. The business arm. The non-governmental
[26:40.480 --> 26:48.980]  organizations. This is all agenda 21. All you in. The SPP's business arm, called the
[26:48.980 --> 26:55.600]  North American Competitiveness Council, rejected the criticism as misguided. Oh, you're misguided.
[26:55.600 --> 27:00.520]  Saying that there was nothing secretive about their work or that of the partnership, Tom
[27:00.520 --> 27:06.840]  Aquino of the Canadian Council of Chief Executive said, there hasn't been public input because
[27:06.840 --> 27:12.400]  most people aren't clued into the issues. Oh, we're just stupid and don't. We're stupid
[27:12.400 --> 27:19.240]  because in our society, this is never covered because by design, we've been made ignorant.
[27:19.240 --> 27:23.760]  How do we take a lot of issues that are really quite important, but frankly, quite boring?
[27:23.760 --> 27:27.280]  They're not terribly exciting. Again, this is boring. Don't be involved. And bring those
[27:27.280 --> 27:31.320]  to the public light so that people will discuss them. All I can say is that the more of the
[27:31.320 --> 27:36.840]  discussions that we have, the better and probably the faster than it will be to get results.
[27:36.840 --> 27:40.920]  The council tabled a series of recommendations to the ministers. Many of them were moving
[27:40.920 --> 27:46.520]  and revolving around the situation at the borders. And see, they had a big propaganda
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.920]  event because you read the SPP Fourier releases. And again, the best article I've seen is
[27:51.920 --> 27:56.440]  written by Farah of WorldNet Daily in January. I'm saying that because Steve Watson's listening.
[27:56.440 --> 28:00.680]  He's going to write a big report on this. He uses my research and his own research.
[28:00.680 --> 28:04.120]  We collaboratively don't even have time to talk to each other on the phone. So we do
[28:04.120 --> 28:09.760]  it here on air. This isn't just for the audience. It's a very weird radio, but people like it.
[28:09.760 --> 28:14.040]  This is real war room, folks. We're actually here in the war room breaking this down. So
[28:14.040 --> 28:18.200]  Paul and Steve, I forget the exact headline on that. I read it two weeks ago on air. It
[28:18.200 --> 28:22.800]  came out about a month ago. It was extremely powerful. And the reason I say that, because
[28:22.800 --> 28:26.840]  it was bullet point by bullet point, I went and read most of the Fourier released hundreds
[28:26.840 --> 28:32.480]  of pages of documents. But for you, just get the WorldNet Daily. You had most of it and
[28:32.480 --> 28:38.920]  then integrate it with this new info. But then also link to the judicialwatch.org subsection
[28:38.920 --> 28:44.960]  that has two different filings and releases of Fourier documents. The reason I say that
[28:44.960 --> 28:49.840]  is SPP says, oh, we need to be publicly want to be public. But the first thing they did
[28:49.840 --> 28:55.360]  again was say, this is all got to be secret. And they were clearly running the meeting.
[28:55.360 --> 28:59.200]  How do we take a lot of issues that are really quite important, but frankly, quite boring?
[28:59.200 --> 29:02.840]  They're not terribly exciting and bring those the public light so that people will discuss
[29:02.840 --> 29:07.440]  them. All I can say is that the more of this discussion that we have, the better and probably
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.440]  the faster that it will be to get results. The council tabled a series of recommendations
[29:12.440 --> 29:17.520]  to ministers, many of them revolving around the situation at the borders. They were critical.
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.240]  The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, the American plan that will require passports
[29:23.240 --> 29:26.760]  at all the ports of entry. The report urged the governments to come up with a low cost
[29:26.760 --> 29:31.440]  secure alternative for continental security goes on, which was the plan all along, which
[29:31.440 --> 29:36.480]  the UN has announced, which the Homeland Security has announced a continental security border
[29:36.480 --> 29:44.400]  with a mix of Mexican, Canadian and US customs with no internal borders. That's the plan.
[29:44.400 --> 29:49.640]  But again, they grandstand it at the public meeting claiming the whole meeting was about
[29:49.640 --> 29:55.160]  helping the economy and stopping terrorist. That's all they're trying to do. But you read
[29:55.160 --> 29:58.760]  the four year documents, none of it has to do with quote terrorist. It's all about how
[29:58.760 --> 30:02.960]  to consolidate wealth, how to destroy the middle class, how to keep the North American Union
[30:02.960 --> 30:09.520]  secret. So there's my basic analysis of that big report coming out on info wars dot net
[30:09.520 --> 30:13.320]  or prism hunter dot com. I'm not sure which one tomorrow on this integrating at all. We're
[30:13.320 --> 30:17.480]  going to come back and give you Lou Dobbs research on this and even interviewed Ron
[30:17.480 --> 30:27.360]  Paul as his expert, the presidential candidate will be right back. We're on the March, the
[30:27.360 --> 30:38.520]  empires on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. Hey, Jane, how's it going?
[30:38.520 --> 30:43.160]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well. Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood
[30:43.160 --> 30:48.480]  sugar is way out of control. Oh, Jane, I'm sorry to hear that. I have to monitor my blood
[30:48.480 --> 30:52.920]  sugar again. If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood
[30:52.920 --> 30:58.920]  sugar that really works. Have you tried sucreblast? For millions of Americans who can't keep their
[30:58.920 --> 31:04.280]  high blood sugar levels off their minds, there's sucreblast. Sucreblast is the all-natural

[31:35.920 --> 31:42.880]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[31:42.880 --> 31:46.400]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American Empire instead
[31:46.400 --> 31:50.960]  of what's fair for the American people. The only antidote to the poison of globalism
[31:50.960 --> 31:56.000]  is nationalism. Start reading The Nationalist Times each month. The Nationalist Times promotes

[32:35.800 --> 32:40.000]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[32:40.000 --> 32:44.400]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp. According to the
[32:44.400 --> 32:49.160]  company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air. I was so amazed.
[32:49.160 --> 32:53.320]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light. Both my husband and
[32:53.320 --> 32:58.040]  I could tell the difference. Soleil Wellness dot com is a unique company that offers salt
[32:58.040 --> 33:02.800]  wellness products from around the world. So, I went back to the site and ordered their
[33:02.800 --> 33:07.120]  Soleil simple natural cleaning products. Also made with Himalayan salt. I figured it would
[33:07.120 --> 33:12.040]  clean really well. The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[33:12.040 --> 33:16.640]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with. Plus,
[33:16.640 --> 33:20.040]  the service was great. If you're interested in natural homeopathic
[33:20.040 --> 33:26.840]  time-tested remedies, visit soleilwellness.com. That's S-O-L-A-Y wellness dot com or call

[33:54.640 --> 34:16.040]  That's too much confusion. I can't get no relief. I tell you, I got depressed yesterday.
[34:16.040 --> 34:24.080]  I rarely get depressed. But again, it was just the beauty of just the happy people I
[34:24.080 --> 34:31.360]  see as I drive down the road. Again, the moon, up during the day, the blue skies, all the
[34:31.360 --> 34:37.160]  good things in life and all of the meek things and the ignorant things and the defenseless
[34:37.160 --> 34:48.600]  things who I just want to warn. I got depressed over getting these sealed FBI documents, the
[34:48.600 --> 34:53.280]  filing that's now been unsealed concerning evidence of the government being involved
[34:53.280 --> 34:58.280]  in the attacks. We've always known it, but you take out and get happy as we prove it
[34:58.280 --> 35:03.160]  and nail it down and get more and more evidence. But it's depressing. I mean, there's people
[35:03.160 --> 35:08.960]  who will blow up daycare centers, who will kill children, and then there's all these
[35:08.960 --> 35:14.160]  stupid, ignorant individuals who work for the government and work for these corporations
[35:14.160 --> 35:22.080]  that are doing this, who are compartmentalized and bottom-liner part of the problem. They're
[35:22.080 --> 35:27.600]  just so cowardly, they won't admit what they're part of. And look, this is what we do. This
[35:27.600 --> 35:31.600]  is what we research. We don't set about to prove our point of view on something. We
[35:31.600 --> 35:40.720]  wish we were wrong. And it's just so horrible what we're facing. None of us are safe while
[35:40.720 --> 35:43.840]  these globalists are in power. We're always going to have corruption. There's always going
[35:43.840 --> 35:46.840]  to be evil in the hearts of men. There's always going to be problems. But this current
[35:46.840 --> 35:51.760]  crop of elites, their fathers and grandfathers and mothers, literally funded linen and
[35:51.760 --> 35:58.000]  Stalin and Mao and Hitler, and they literally have engineered a world of just control and
[35:58.000 --> 36:03.360]  domination. And that's why they're in power, because they're ruthless. And I just, it's
[36:03.360 --> 36:09.680]  such a curse on humanity. And now Americans have gotten fat, dumb and happy and very decadent.
[36:09.680 --> 36:13.640]  And my fellow Americans may know they're being lied to, but I don't think they realize just
[36:13.640 --> 36:17.920]  how serious things have gotten. We're going to go to Mark and Mike and Ron and Alakai
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.440]  and Mike and others here in just a moment. But here's Lou Dobbs, Friday night talking
[36:22.440 --> 36:27.640]  about the security and prosperity partnership, having a public PR stunt meeting where they
[36:27.640 --> 36:31.960]  claim it's about stopping terrorists and helping the economy. When you read the globalization
[36:31.960 --> 36:37.040]  documents, it's about consolidating and lowering standard of living. It's about annihilating
[36:37.040 --> 36:43.080]  any competition to the elite. It's about securing their monopoly of power and control over humanity
[36:43.080 --> 36:48.360]  and putting a high tech casual society surveillance grid into place designed by the Pentagon and
[36:48.360 --> 36:54.600]  MIT with behavioral recognition cameras on every street corner in your house and on your
[36:54.600 --> 36:59.560]  computers. The Houston police chief again calling for cameras and everyone's homes. I mean,
[36:59.560 --> 37:05.480]  cameras and bathrooms everywhere. It's just it's it's it. This is not freedom. Here's
[37:05.480 --> 37:10.040]  Lou Dobbs. We'll analyze this clip and go to your Coles.
[37:10.040 --> 37:15.560]  Mexican truckers apparently will soon be hitting American highways. The US Department of Transportation
[37:15.560 --> 37:20.840]  announcing a plan that allows Mexican trucking companies to begin making deliveries in the
[37:20.840 --> 37:27.400]  United States. That is, if the Bush administration has its way and follows through on an announcement
[37:27.400 --> 37:33.000]  made not in the United States, but in Monterey, Mexico. Bill Tucker's here to tell us it may
[37:33.000 --> 37:41.560]  be one more example of trade, trumping security and national interest. Load up in Mexico and
[37:41.560 --> 37:46.680]  just keep trucking past the border crossing into the heart of America. It will be the
[37:46.680 --> 37:52.400]  first time Mexican trucks and truckers will be allowed on our roads since 1982. And for
[37:52.400 --> 37:59.520]  the first time ever, US truckers will also be allowed the same access to Mexico's highways.
[37:59.520 --> 38:04.320]  Foreign Secretary Mary Peters making the announcement today, saying the authority to launch the
[38:04.320 --> 38:10.200]  program is granted to the DOT under the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is not a
[38:10.200 --> 38:13.720]  program that sits well with the leader of the Teamsters Union.
[38:13.720 --> 38:19.880]  What's happening here is that the Bush administration is buckling to the pressure of Mexican business
[38:19.880 --> 38:26.040]  and the Mexican government and US business to have cheaper trucks and cheaper truck drivers
[38:26.040 --> 38:32.080]  on the highway at the sacrifice of American safety on the highway so that corporations
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.080]  can make more money. The pilot program is scheduled to be a year
[38:36.080 --> 38:42.080]  long and to begin in roughly 60 days. Democrats in Congress have no intention of letting the
[38:42.080 --> 38:48.240]  program proceed unchecked. Representatives Peter DeFazio and James Oberstar, who lead
[38:48.240 --> 38:53.680]  the House Transportation Committee, put out a statement saying, quote, under NAFTA, the
[38:53.680 --> 39:00.240]  US has consistently compromised its environmental and labor standards. Now we're being asked
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.400]  to risk the safety of citizens on highways and in communities where these trucks will
[39:05.400 --> 39:11.520]  travel. DOT officials respond, saying, Mexican drivers will be required to meet the same
[39:11.520 --> 39:17.760]  regulations as American truckers and truck companies. Both congressmen are promising
[39:17.760 --> 39:23.640]  hearings. On the Senate side, Senator Patty Murray sits on the Senate Transportation Subcommittee
[39:23.640 --> 39:27.800]  and she's promising hearings on the DOT's actions as well.
[39:27.800 --> 39:33.000]  Now the announcement does have one significant concession from the Mexican government. For
[39:33.000 --> 39:37.800]  the first time ever, US inspectors will be allowed into Mexico to conduct inspectors'
[39:37.800 --> 39:43.280]  inspections of trucks there. And under the terms of the pilot program, DOT officials
[39:43.280 --> 39:49.360]  lure promising that 100% of the trucks involved in this program will be inspected to see if
[39:49.360 --> 39:57.440]  they meet safety requirements. I can't say that I, as I think about this, this government,
[39:57.440 --> 40:02.000]  this administration, and what it is doing to American working men and women in this
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.280]  country and their families, the way they're proceeding with the North American Union,
[40:07.280 --> 40:13.880]  this integration so-called security and prosperity partnership. What this administration is doing,
[40:13.880 --> 40:18.800]  I wouldn't believe a word anyone in this administration said about anything. And there's
[40:18.800 --> 40:23.040]  significant questions about whether they can, in fact, the United States, we can inspect
[40:23.040 --> 40:29.120]  all of those trucks because of roughly 17,500 truck crossings every year, Lou.
[40:29.120 --> 40:34.400]  This is, it's unconscionable. And the way this administration is behaving, its conduct
[40:34.400 --> 40:42.600]  is rising to a level of recklessness and disregard for the American people that I think is bordering
[40:42.600 --> 40:43.800]  on the unacceptable.
[40:43.800 --> 40:49.560]  Well, Tucker, thank you very much. Top-level meetings in Ottawa today to hammer out changes
[40:49.560 --> 40:56.320]  in border security, the energy grid and regulations among the United States, Canada, and Mexico,
[40:56.320 --> 41:02.400]  that too part of an effort to integrate the economies of the three nations by 2010. The
[41:02.400 --> 41:07.800]  plan is moving quickly at the highest levels of our government and, of course, at the highest
[41:07.800 --> 41:13.760]  level of corporate America, with that congressional oversight and certainly without, in most cases,
[41:13.760 --> 41:20.160]  public knowledge and certainly without public approval. Christine Romans now examines the
[41:20.160 --> 41:28.240]  agenda of today's meeting and the implications for the United States as a nation.
[41:28.240 --> 41:31.480]  It's called the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[41:31.480 --> 41:38.920]  This is a broad agenda that is going to make life better for people. It is the only way
[41:38.920 --> 41:44.120]  that we can achieve security and prosperity for people through this cooperation.
[41:44.120 --> 41:52.000]  We recognize today that the issue of security is intrinsically linked with economic and
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.560]  trade flows.
[41:53.560 --> 41:56.120]  It's all about cooperation amongst our neighbors.
[41:56.120 --> 42:01.600]  Three governments working closely with 30 big corporations called the North American Competitiveness
[42:01.600 --> 42:07.800]  Council. This diverse group of companies presented a wish list to its governments. Quote, improving
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.240]  the secure flow of goods and people within North America. From breakfast cereal to food
[42:12.240 --> 42:17.440]  safety inspections, cutting red tape, quote, minimizing minor differences between standards
[42:17.440 --> 42:23.360]  and regulations between three countries. Another priority, integrating the energy grid. Business,
[42:23.360 --> 42:29.320]  a driving force in the SPP. The Canadian Public Safety Minister was asked, where was the input
[42:29.320 --> 42:31.720]  from the citizens of the three countries?
[42:31.720 --> 42:37.160]  That type of thing happens in different venues on a host of other occasions.
[42:37.160 --> 42:41.920]  Other concerns in the U.S. It's a process designed to move forward without congressional
[42:41.920 --> 42:48.160]  approval. SPP architects maintain it's not necessary. Some members of Congress disagree.
[42:48.160 --> 42:53.040]  They may well be doing something decent and good. Who knows? Maybe there are some benefits
[42:53.040 --> 42:57.200]  of these things they're suggesting. But to me, it's sort of a collusion between secret
[42:57.200 --> 43:01.040]  government and big business, and I don't like what I see coming.
[43:01.040 --> 43:05.360]  Key and other border security advocates see a move toward open borders. They point to
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.600]  business community statements like today's, quote, any tightening of the borders between
[43:09.600 --> 43:14.960]  Canada, Mexico, and the United States threatens to erode the North American advantage created
[43:14.960 --> 43:16.800]  by NAFTA.
[43:16.800 --> 43:21.880]  The criticism of the SPP and its mission spans the political spectrum. Here, conservative
[43:21.880 --> 43:25.280]  groups like Judicial Watch fear an attack on the sovereignty of these countries, and
[43:25.280 --> 43:29.760]  they'd like more transparency into the process. On the left, in Canada, are those who fear
[43:29.760 --> 43:34.160]  a move to undermine their health care and their food safety rules in favor of lower
[43:34.160 --> 43:37.680]  common standards between all three of these countries, Lou?
[43:37.680 --> 43:43.800]  There is, of course, a wide range of choices to make here when one talks about examples
[43:43.800 --> 43:49.760]  of the arrogance of this administration and the abuse of power by this government in a
[43:49.760 --> 43:56.320]  nation that is, after all, a representative democracy or at least it once was. But for
[43:56.320 --> 44:04.120]  that minister, the Canadian minister to respond, that happens in other venues. And on the
[44:04.120 --> 44:10.280]  other occasions, the fact is, there is no role for the consent of the government in
[44:10.280 --> 44:11.280]  this process.
[44:11.280 --> 44:14.720]  And that's exactly what the critics are saying. They'd like to know where their role is in
[44:14.720 --> 44:19.480]  this, especially since it's designed to transcend politics. No matter who's in government, no
[44:19.480 --> 44:23.360]  matter who we vote in, this is something that's meant to move along on its own, and that's
[44:23.360 --> 44:25.120]  something that concerns people.
[44:25.120 --> 44:32.280]  It should more than concern. It should infuriate. It should mobilize. Anyone who cares about
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.680]  something as archaic as a nation state called the United States of America. This is absolutely
[44:38.680 --> 44:45.920]  reprehensible conduct into what level it rises will depend upon, I suppose, to the extent
[44:45.920 --> 44:50.960]  they can get away with it, what happens next. Christine, thank you. Christine Romans. That
[44:50.960 --> 44:53.880]  brings us to the subject of our poll tonight.
[44:53.880 --> 44:57.320]  And then, of course, in the high 90s, people are against it, just like we're against the
[44:57.320 --> 45:01.200]  toll roads and existing roads, just like we're against the open borders, just like we're
[45:01.200 --> 45:06.480]  against the Iraq war. And they just say, we don't care. Shut up. We have men in black
[45:06.480 --> 45:10.160]  uniforms and black masks. If you give us a problem, they'll microwave gun you down on
[45:10.160 --> 45:14.440]  the streets. They'll come to your houses and blow your guts all over the wall. Do you understand?
[45:14.440 --> 45:19.400]  Shut up. We're the new world order. We run things. Take your vaccines. Eat your GMO food
[45:19.400 --> 45:21.760]  and shut up.
[45:21.760 --> 45:30.120]  Okay, fine. Enjoy it, ladies and gentlemen, because it's going to get worse and worse.
[45:30.120 --> 45:34.040]  You like globalization? Do you devalue them the dollar by almost half? Do you like globalization
[45:34.040 --> 45:35.480]  destroying your country?
[45:35.480 --> 45:46.040]  All right, let me start at the beginning with the trucks. Number one, the trucks have been
[45:46.040 --> 45:52.560]  here for at least four or five years. Okay, driving on I-37 or I-35, there's Mexican trucks
[45:52.560 --> 45:59.800]  all over the place. Period. That's the bottom line. You can see it everywhere. I've been
[45:59.800 --> 46:05.480]  on airplanes flying to Chicago, and I'm sitting next to a guy who's sitting there before we
[46:05.480 --> 46:11.440]  take off from Chicago back to Austin, and he's sitting there for 30 minutes while the
[46:11.440 --> 46:15.640]  plane waits on a cell phone giving orders to his Mexican truckers. And I say, where
[46:15.640 --> 46:19.240]  are you based? I'm based in New York. How many trucks you got? It was, I forget, hundreds.
[46:19.240 --> 46:23.480]  And he goes, yeah, they're all Mexican. It's based in Mexico, and they drive up through
[46:23.480 --> 46:28.200]  Texas all the way to New York in all points between. And he was just laughing about it.
[46:28.200 --> 46:34.160]  Oh, see, the bush is now going to do it. You're now going to get a national ID card. You've
[46:34.160 --> 46:38.560]  had one since the early 90s. You're now going to have an North American Union. It's been
[46:38.560 --> 46:45.680]  going into place for decades. You're now going to, it's just on and on and on. And the sick
[46:45.680 --> 46:50.520]  freaks are trying to make mandatory new vaccines in Canada, the U.S. and England, where the
[46:50.520 --> 46:55.560]  live virus attacks your brain so that you never could use drugs again because it won't
[46:55.560 --> 46:59.680]  make you feel good. But yeah, because it ate holes in your brain. I know I just threw
[46:59.680 --> 47:03.640]  that in. It's because, I mean, it's twilight zone. I mean, they're talking about making
[47:03.640 --> 47:09.400]  us take vaccines that eat holes in our brain. It's mainstream news. And we're all just acting
[47:09.400 --> 47:10.400]  like it's normal.
[47:10.400 --> 47:17.760]  All right, let me get back into what I was saying. Number one, the trucks are already
[47:17.760 --> 47:23.880]  here. They say that U.S. trucks will be allowed into Mexico. Oh, really? Last year I was down
[47:23.880 --> 47:29.720]  in Costa Maya, Mexico. We took a bus trip to see some of the pyramids. And we got stopped
[47:29.720 --> 47:34.000]  in the bus driver had to pay off the military with machine guns. And they were stopping
[47:34.000 --> 47:39.600]  another bus coming the other way. Okay, that's how Mexico is. Oh, yes, our inspectors will
[47:39.600 --> 47:43.240]  be down there and our trucks will go down there. And you know what, when they take the
[47:43.240 --> 47:48.160]  trucks wholesale and just steal them, it won't be on the news. It just won't be. And
[47:48.160 --> 47:54.080]  maybe Ludobs, oh, that's our friends to the south. And they say it's a pilot program.
[47:54.080 --> 47:57.560]  Again, nothing pilot about it. By the way, you notice it says our inspectors will be
[47:57.560 --> 48:01.440]  down there. Yes. And under the North American Union, SPP, they'll be up here. In fact, they'll
[48:01.440 --> 48:05.600]  be a port at Kansas City, where the Mexican government will search the goods coming in
[48:05.600 --> 48:10.440]  from southern Mexico all the way to the U.S. Again, this is globalization. Our regulators
[48:10.440 --> 48:15.160]  are down there. Their regulators are up here. Vice versa with Canada. And this is the new
[48:15.160 --> 48:22.600]  world order, ladies and gentlemen. And so that's the bottom line on that. Notice con
[48:22.600 --> 48:28.040]  Lisa Rice said it's the only way we're going to have security and economic success is if
[48:28.040 --> 48:33.360]  we have this integration. It's the only way we're going to be safe. It's a security and
[48:33.360 --> 48:39.040]  prosperity. It's just, by the way, it makes it harder for citizens of Mexico, Canada and
[48:39.040 --> 48:44.440]  the U.S. if they do it legally to migrate back and forth. Unless it's a selected worker
[48:44.440 --> 48:48.520]  group out of Mexico or any of the third world nation who are allowed to come in on unlimited
[48:48.520 --> 48:53.280]  work visas under the plan. So see, under this plan, is it easier to go to Canada? Is it easier
[48:53.280 --> 49:01.440]  to get into the U.S. now if you're above board? Oh, no, it's a nightmare. So again, more controls
[49:01.440 --> 49:05.680]  over us, more regulations over us, but the illegal aliens, you don't have to show ID
[49:05.680 --> 49:11.600]  to get a bank account, housing loan or car loan. It's a joke. But don't worry, the state
[49:11.600 --> 49:16.280]  police are out there with their radar guns everywhere, you know, keeping us safe on roads
[49:16.280 --> 49:21.120]  designed to drive 90 miles an hour. So you got to drive 70 all bunched in in big packs
[49:21.120 --> 49:25.560]  of cars wrecking everywhere. They've done German studies at Safer to actually drive
[49:25.560 --> 49:28.840]  and stay away from other cars. Now they give you tickets if you're driving in the fast
[49:28.840 --> 49:33.040]  lane, not not even blocking anybody. They're just out there radar gunning everyone feeling
[49:33.040 --> 49:38.160]  good because they tell the agencies there's no money. There's a deficit. We've got a increase
[49:38.160 --> 49:44.080]  in enforcement. New York in the last three years has upped its quote spot checks and
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.880]  searches five times from 90 something thousand to over 500,000. Every other state is more
[49:49.880 --> 49:55.800]  than doubled. All the small things don't wear seatbelt go to jail. Seen smoking go to jail
[49:55.800 --> 50:00.400]  in your car. Seen on a cell phone go to jail. Cameras everywhere scanning us. It's going
[50:00.400 --> 50:05.160]  to be maximum enforcement on everybody and making things that were civil. Now criminal
[50:05.160 --> 50:10.480]  penalty penalties. You're going to have point systems already going in three tickets. They
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.080]  randomly take your license or charge you thousands of dollars. They don't even tell
[50:14.080 --> 50:19.280]  you exactly what they'll do. Just just hellish micro management kids getting frisk and checked
[50:19.280 --> 50:23.280]  got to show ID and be thumb scanned to get a lot of the schools now thumb scanning for
[50:23.280 --> 50:27.960]  school lunches thumb scanning for library books being searched being controlled cameras
[50:27.960 --> 50:35.160]  in the bathrooms. Our journey to enslavement is now heating up. We're getting deeper into
[50:35.160 --> 50:41.680]  the murk now deeper into the tyranny deeper into the control. And the illegal aliens are
[50:41.680 --> 50:45.760]  exempt because they're part of the North American Union. Again, I don't even blame them. They
[50:45.760 --> 50:48.400]  just want a better life. But the point is it's part of the globalist plan to drive down
[50:48.400 --> 50:54.600]  wages and break this country up. And they selectively enforce what sheriffs in Vermont
[50:54.600 --> 50:58.520]  and Tennessee and other places go. Yeah, we arrest the illegals. The state police arrest
[50:58.520 --> 51:03.760]  the illegals and the it's catching release. They're just given a form and under any fake
[51:03.760 --> 51:07.880]  name and release and they haven't ended that they've expanded that you can't get board
[51:07.880 --> 51:14.200]  of patrol to come pick them up because there isn't the funding. But the state police will
[51:14.200 --> 51:18.840]  pull you over boy need to do a search your children's safety seats to make sure they're

[51:48.720 --> 51:53.920]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them. Terror storm
[51:53.920 --> 51:59.160]  proves that not only was 9 11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7 7 in London were carried
[51:59.160 --> 52:03.200]  out by British intelligence. Terror storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in
[52:03.200 --> 52:09.560]  Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture,
[52:09.560 --> 52:14.160]  the latest 9 11 information and much, much more. Terror storm is the definitive guide

[52:44.600 --> 52:49.040]  they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems. They can purify
[52:49.040 --> 52:54.680]  raw untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes
[52:54.680 --> 53:00.600]  and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene and mtbe. These elements also reduce
[53:00.600 --> 53:05.680]  unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum. Unbelievably, they even remove
[53:05.680 --> 53:10.080]  small micro particulate from water like food coloring particles. Yet they leave in the
[53:10.080 --> 53:14.520]  nutritional minerals that your body needs. Moreover, because they are recleanable, black

[38:10.100 --> 55:25.360]  Welcome back. All right, I know I haven't gone to your calls. You're
[55:25.360 --> 55:28.240]  going to do that now. Coming up, I'm going to give you a brief report on Barack Obama
[55:28.240 --> 55:34.080]  getting confronted at a bigger rally on 9-Eleven Truth here in Austin Friday. Then yesterday,
[55:34.080 --> 55:38.200]  they blew up the Intel building and well, the control demolitions couldn't even blow
[55:38.200 --> 55:44.800]  the whole thing up. But oh, 9-Eleven, excellent job they did. Let's go ahead and go to Alkai
[55:44.800 --> 55:48.880]  in Hawaii, then Mark, Mike, Ron, Mike and others. Go ahead, Alkai.
[55:48.880 --> 55:54.480]  Hey, yo, Alex. You, I think you pronounced my name right. What would you say again?
[55:54.480 --> 55:58.160]  Alkai, is that correct? Yeah, I called you like, I don't know, five
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.440]  years ago, six years ago. Remember me? Probably not, right? I don't know about you. What's
[56:03.440 --> 56:05.600]  on your mind? Oh, I was just going to say, I think these
[56:05.600 --> 56:09.600]  are the two strongest arguments. Like, these are the two top smoking guns that truthers
[56:09.600 --> 56:15.000]  should push when they get onto like Fox News or CNN or talk radio or other media outlets
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.880]  trying to talk about 9-Eleven. Because these are like, I think these are the two best arguments
[56:18.880 --> 56:25.720]  in my mind. You know, the New York firefighters, the police
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.000]  officers and the first responders that have gone public saying they were told get back,
[56:30.000 --> 56:36.160]  7 is going to be brought down. That's the first point. And the second one is the hijackers
[56:36.160 --> 56:43.080]  being trained at US bases. I think those are the two ones that I think have the best chance
[56:43.080 --> 56:46.560]  at actually convincing people. And by the way, both of those are admitted.
[56:46.560 --> 56:51.680]  The hijackers admittedly were trained and covered operations secretly. The heads of
[56:51.680 --> 56:55.720]  bases have gone public, but they came out of the mainstream news, but they never got
[56:55.720 --> 56:59.280]  covered again. Yeah, I know. Like, those are the ones that
[56:59.280 --> 57:03.480]  you actually have names of people. You know what? I tend to agree with you.
[57:03.480 --> 57:07.640]  I've said that I think the hijacker issue has been way overlooked, and I try to make
[57:07.640 --> 57:11.440]  that a central issue. All right. Oh, and that's basically all I want
[57:11.440 --> 57:18.440]  to say, but also something else. I'm tired of, what is that? You know about MSG. It's
[57:18.440 --> 57:23.000]  like in almost every food now, MSG. Oh, listen, you can hardly find potato chips
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  that don't have it. You can hardly find any processed food that doesn't have it, and it's
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.160]  horrible. I've searched the whole store, and I couldn't
[57:31.160 --> 57:36.080]  find anything. It's a deadly poison when you give it to cats or dogs or mice. Their
[57:36.080 --> 57:41.240]  brains go hyperactive and produce massive amounts of the hormone that causes your
[57:41.240 --> 57:47.480]  body to produce more fat cells, and it even kills your brain cells by making them go
[57:47.480 --> 57:51.000]  hyperactive. I know. It's an excitotoxin. But, you know,
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.360]  we've had top scientists on. Don't believe them. Shell phones are good. MSG's good. GMO
[57:55.360 --> 57:58.880]  foods are good. It doesn't matter if all the reports say it kills. You just enjoy it.
[57:58.880 --> 58:03.000]  The government loves you. Thanks for the call, Al Kai. Good to hear from you.
[58:03.000 --> 58:06.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark and Atlanta Jojo. Go ahead, sir.
[58:06.680 --> 58:13.920]  I believe it's an Ezekiel that it is told that, you know, like Ezekiel, you're a watchman
[58:13.920 --> 58:20.720]  on the wall, and you're sending out warning, and if the people don't heed it, then their
[58:20.720 --> 58:25.720]  blood is on their own. You are discharging your duty. So, you know, you've called out
[58:25.720 --> 58:31.640]  a warning, and the warning is that the enemy is within our own gates, that it's not out
[58:31.640 --> 58:39.640]  there, and you're routinely in my prayers. And I was wondering, what can I help Ron Paul?
[58:39.640 --> 58:46.520]  I've been trying to get in touch with other people about the DVD. I've got a DVD burner
[58:46.520 --> 58:52.080]  active back with a DVD player on my desktop, which is handy for me. And I want to see about
[58:52.080 --> 58:55.240]  getting something that promotes Ron Paul and what he's about.
[58:55.240 --> 58:59.560]  Well, here's the thing. He has a small office and a small staff. They're doing the exploratory
[58:59.560 --> 59:03.400]  committee now. He's going to run. He's just trying to get everything lined up. He's got
[59:03.400 --> 59:08.840]  to jump through all these regulatory hoops. He's going to be running. Anything else you
[59:08.840 --> 59:09.840]  want to add?
[59:09.840 --> 59:16.040]  Do you love Jesus.org? Let her you and I'll stay there. I'll just come back to you.
[59:16.040 --> 59:23.040]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-376-45.
[59:23.040 --> 59:31.720]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks, anthrax
[59:31.720 --> 59:36.480]  and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic. Alarming words for our time. But how do you
[59:36.480 --> 59:38.880]  protect your family during such a crisis?
[59:38.880 --> 59:43.240]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical and
[59:43.240 --> 59:48.000]  radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LaBaron, a health physicist who has served
[59:48.000 --> 59:52.880]  as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases and has worked as a nuclear specialist
[59:52.880 --> 59:56.680]  for the U.S. government. Anyone can follow the simple instructions. It's presented by
[59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.440]  us as a prepared home as a shelter. If you're not the type who waits till it's too late,
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.960]  then you need the video sheltering in place. Get the critical information you need now
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:12.520]  for only $29 plus shipping by calling new millennium at triple late 803-4438 and tell
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:25.200]  them Alex Jones sent you at triple late 803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:37.080]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:45.760]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:54.760]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:58.680]  Already into hour number two, I'm going to recap and get into some of the new developments
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.800]  concerning the clear evidence that Oklahoma City was an inside job. We've gotten sections
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:12.520]  of the now unsealed federal lawsuit and the deposition of Terry Nichols concerning Oklahoma
[01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:19.800]  being, quote, an FBI operation. We've got a bunch of news on target. I ran. We've got
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:24.080]  a guest coming up for about 10, 15 minutes at the bottom of the shower. Talk about confronting
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.960]  Barack Obama on 9-11 and a controlled demolition they had here in Austin yesterday. But right
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.520]  now, let's continue with your calls. Mike and Atlanta, you were trying to finish something
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:40.400]  up before the break cut you off. Oh, okay. Well, a friend of mine in the John Burke society
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.560]  is of the view that we will fight and ultimately lose to the Antichrist. The good news is that
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:52.280]  after our heads are reattached to our shoulders, we will reign with Christ for years. And to
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.920]  me, that makes it all worth it. I'd rather lose in a good fight than win on the fight
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:04.080]  of evil, right? I agree. And I appreciate your call. What would it profit a man to gain
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:12.560]  the whole world and lose his soul? The problem is, well, I don't want to get off into a big
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.280]  debate about theology, but they, but for about 100 years, they've been telling Christians,
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:24.640]  lay down, go along with evil, don't fight it because the world's just going to end.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.520]  And you know, regardless of when the Antichrist stands up and when all this happens, we have
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.040]  a duty to go, hey, Dinecore is running child kidnapping rings. Here it is in the Chicago
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:37.400]  Tribune. We better stand up and try to defend these people. They're being raped and tortured
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:43.120]  and killed right now. Hey, there, these genetically modified potatoes that most of us eat every
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.240]  day kill over half the rats in just a month after they start eating them because it has
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:52.200]  artificial, you know, new amino acids in them and it really hurts humans. Hey, we better
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.400]  talk about that. Hey, Rick Perry wants to try to lie and claim that girls have to take
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:02.280]  an experimental vaccine. We need to fight it. Hey, we were lied into Iraq by design to
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.080]  make the world hate us and shut the US up for a fall. Now that's completely evident.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:14.200]  Hey, we've got a job to warn people. And so duty is ours. Consequence belongs to God.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:20.200]  I mean, I may not have a snowball chance in hell of defeating the New World Order and
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.040]  defeating this current manifestation. It doesn't matter. I'm going to fight them and
[01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.720]  try to defend. I know if we lay down, they're just going to win that much quicker and have
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:32.200]  that much more fun. I mean, let's say a couple lions had me cornered and they were about
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.600]  to eat me. I'm going to fight them. May not have a chance before they grab me around the
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:43.480]  neck and break my neck, but I'm going to attack. I'm going to fight back. By the way, statistically,
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:47.240]  that's happened to people not just with mountain lions, but with a real deal. A lot of times
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.080]  they see something charge them back, something fight them back. They end up running off.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.120]  Same thing with grizzly bears. It's not like you could actually win that fight if they
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.560]  really fought you 110%. But the point is, it's the initiative. Are they willing to get
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.640]  hurt in the process of killing you? Are you going to act like a prey animal, like a bunny
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:08.080]  rabbit or a gazelle? No, you want to kill me. I'm going to bite you back. I'm going
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:16.200]  to fight you with everything I've got. It's that simple. You're going to get hurt in
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.780]  the process. Do you think you're the boss? Do you think I'm your slave? You're an evil
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:25.840]  piece of garbage that thinks you can just go on and go on and go on? No. And history
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:32.560]  shows more often than not, if the good stand up, the evil get trounced. I'm starting to
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:39.880]  rant. We're going to break and I'm going to hurry through calls. Okay, 1-800-25-99-231.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:45.040]  Just the callers all bring up such good points. Mike in Pennsylvania, Ron in California, Mike

[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.520]  you'll visit all the sites today. And I hope that while you're there, you'll look at all

[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:46.480]  government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:52.200]  own populations as a pretext to enslave them. Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:57.200]  an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.400]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to

[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:38.240]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:50.600]  a war on for your mind. Continuing with your phone calls, let's go ahead and go to Mike
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:55.400]  in Pennsylvania. Thanks for holding your on the air. Hey Alex, how you doing? Good sir.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.960]  Okay, first of all I'd like to give you my internet nickname because I often write you
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:04.080]  news tips and stuff like that. Would that be okay? Sure. I call myself Mike and I put
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:08.400]  it in front of his rack attack so I don't know if you've ever read any of my emails to you,
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:14.000]  but that's who I am. One main question that I have to ask you, you kind of had ESP, is
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.400]  about this virus, this life of virus that attacks your brain. That's the main question
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.160]  that I wanted to ask you about. I want to ask you about more details about that. What's
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.280]  the name of it and stuff like that? Okay, I've been covering it for two years. It's
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:31.880]  a whole class of vaccines and I'm actually doing the research now to collate all that
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:41.520]  again and put it in a film I'm making. It's a whole class of vaccines and it's a psychoactive
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:48.680]  class of viruses that go in and attack the receptors that would take on the molecules
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:55.440]  of opiates, narcotics, nicotine because those all plug in basically the same type of receptor
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:04.400]  sites. The virus then plugs in, there's an autoimmune response, a plaque is created and
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:13.080]  then you can no longer absorb the quote drugs. The problem is that drugs mimic hormones and
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:19.040]  endorphins and chemicals, compounds that are in the body that make us feel good when we
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.920]  see a sunrise or we get to date with the girl we've had a crush on for a year or we make
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:29.560]  the big sale in business or we help an old lady across the street, we are designed to
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:35.440]  have good feelings and our brain rewards us for following the code that God designed into
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:40.600]  us or even if you don't believe in God, it's science has shown that when you follow basic
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:46.480]  human code of doing the right thing, being good to the tribe, good to the community that
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.920]  you get a rewarding feeling. When we break a big story, when we expose evil, I'll get
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:54.840]  really euphoric and excited. Sometimes I get depressed after because I realize just how
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:00.800]  bad things are once we confirm things. But you ask the name of the vaccine, they got
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.360]  approval for several of them in England. It was in the London Independent, it was in
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:12.200]  the London Times, it was in the BBC two years ago with, it's all over in Full Wars and Prison
[01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.000]  Planet. I can't remember the exact titles of the articles, but it was headlines like
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.960]  New Vaccine to Cure Smokers, New Vaccine to Stop Drug Use. Just type that in, New Vaccine
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:29.400]  to Stop Drug Use or a headline like Government wants all school children to take new anti-drug
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:35.000]  vaccine or new anti-smoking vaccine. There were probably, I don't know, 15, 20 articles
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:39.160]  we read on air over and over again two years ago. The point is, now those companies are
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:44.560]  here, they're pushing it, there's several companies that are doing it. I don't have
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:51.320]  it here in front of me. So when I raised the point about the Merck Human Papilloma Virus,
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:59.160]  HPV, when I talk about that, it's the same class. It's a live virus that goes into the
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:04.080]  body and engages in different programming functions and then supposedly causes an autoimmune response
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:10.600]  and then you're cured. That's not even as bad as the live viruses that actually create
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:16.400]  plaques in the brain. Does it actually kill brain cells? Yes, it kills them. Okay. Bottom
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:25.240]  line, 11. Let's be clear. They're neurons and they have receptor ganglia. It's neurons
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:31.080]  form to create receptor sites and then when the chemical goes in, it fires an electrochemical
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:40.440]  jolt through that neuron to larger strands and ganglia. I don't claim to be a neurobiologist
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.600]  or anything, but we've had the scientists on, we've covered what it does and we've
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:50.280]  also shown what mercury does in the receptors. Mercury, when it hits receptors, causes an
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.720]  electrochemical explosion. All other heavy metals simply block them up and kill the cells
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:01.840]  that come in contact with. Mercury causes a surge and causes massive blowouts and kills
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.800]  large areas and then the mercury starts eating through like acid and doesn't stop. It's the
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:11.320]  gift that keeps on giving. That's why it's so particularly deadly and it also causes
[01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:16.800]  autoimmune inflammation that causes brain tissue death as well.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:18.800]  Can I continue? Yeah.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.600]  About 9-11, you have BBC hippies and other debunkers and stuff like that and this guy
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.800]  just called a little while ago saying there's just things that cannot be debunked. One
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.960]  of the things I think is super, it really can't be debunked is these record put options
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.400]  that were put on the main airlines of 9-11.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:44.200]  Just American and United at many, many times, previous record levels. The all-time record
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:50.240]  by leaps and bounds, I think it's what, six times the record level and you've got to watch
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.800]  my films with the actual news articles and then it led back to Alex and Brown and their
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:01.760]  former head, Buzzy Cromgaard, executive director of the CIA at the time, but instead of burning
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:06.920]  down, they burned two low-level FBI agents who just made a few mill locally in New York
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.480]  off of it, they did go to prison.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:14.560]  Two more quick things up. The insurance companies that paid off Larry Silverstein, I did some
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:15.560]  research on it.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.560]  One of them is German.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:20.520]  Yeah, there's like five different insurance companies that dealt with that. Anyway, why
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:26.560]  isn't the insurance companies raising a heck about this and investigating it themselves
[01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.080]  because it would seem that since they're paying it off.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:33.600]  Who do you think owns the major shares in the dominant insurance companies?
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.840]  You had corruption everywhere.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:40.000]  Well, no. Yeah, it's the central Federal Reserve Bank, Bank of England, Buddhist Bank. I appreciate
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.840]  your call. That was brought up. The German bank slash insurance company that paid, I
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.880]  think it was 1.3 billion of the 7 plus billion, Larry Silverstein, the leaseholder has been
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:57.880]  paid on a $190 million investment made two months before the attacks, quite a return.
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:03.880]  If you look at that German company, they did take testimony on seven, but nothing ever
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.160]  came of it. This is how it works. The airlines, too.
[01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:11.320]  At that level of the power structure, these CEOs and individuals, that's why they chose
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:16.640]  Silverstein. I guarantee that's why they chose those insurers because they were in the loop.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.520]  They'll just be paid off through other investments and other government deals and $7 million sounds
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:24.120]  like a lot. It's just chicken feed.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:28.680]  I don't believe the attacks were carried out because they wanted $7 million. They just
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:33.320]  do a cost-benefit analysis, and that was the perfect location because of the things Silverstein
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:38.640]  has already been involved in. Then, of course, that's part of his payout then, a large profit
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:43.200]  for being involved with the attacks. Those are all great questions. Let's go to Ron
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.480]  in California. Ron, go ahead.
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:53.120]  Good morning, Alex, for I guess afternoon now. I want to go through a few things, quick
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:16:00.000]  things. First, I want to start off with a word of encouragement from the Bible, Proverbs
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:07.680]  11-6. The treacherous will be caught by their own greed. Verse 19, And he who pursues evil
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:14.520]  will bring about his own death. In verse 21, And surely the evil man will not go unpunished.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:23.920]  Your work will bring about results. The Lord will make sure that what you're doing and
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:31.160]  all the others out there are doing to stop the New World Order will come to fruition.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:36.520]  But one thing I wanted to ask you is, you've got the Google search bar on your front page
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.960]  of PrismPlanet.com. You start of changing that to Yahoo or Dark Power or one other
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:47.000]  thing. They're all bad. They're all bad. It's all New World Order and we use their tools
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  against them.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:52.840]  Okay. I was just wondering why you had that because you talk about Google quite a bit.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:56.560]  Yeah, no. I mean, we openly expose them, how they've tried to censor us, how they've
[01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:02.640]  erased our numbers of views to keep us off the top 100 with the video. But again, that's
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:08.520]  where the action is. That's where the battlefield is. Just like we might link to a Fox News
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:14.720]  propaganda piece. Every day we've got links to what they're saying. We want you to know.
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.880]  We don't just link the stuff we agree with.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:24.000]  Right. Okay. One thing, I listen to Mike Molloy every night and there's one organization,
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.240]  I think it's 911accountability.org, the running ads on his show. Have you thought of running
[01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:32.720]  ads on his show in other liberal talk shows?
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:39.240]  Well, frankly, I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, but this show is just a totally
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.480]  dwarfs programs of that nature, sir.
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.920]  Oh, okay. So you don't think it would be that much?
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.520]  Yeah. And we're not even geared towards profit here. We probably should be to fund and expand
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:53.960]  what we're doing. But we grow organically and I don't have the capital to go out and
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.600]  do big advertising campaigns. If somebody wants to go produce ads to promote infowars.com
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:05.720]  or prismplanet.com and you want to pay for them, I think that's even better. I can run
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:10.200]  my own ads on this network. I'm so busy I never cut new ads. I mean, I just insane.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.720]  And I have to hire more people. I've got to make more money so I can get a better organization
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:20.240]  together because everybody here has worked to the limit. And sir, there's a thousand
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:22.640]  things we want to do and we're trying to do them all.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:28.000]  Well, one thing I'm interested in doing, who can have contact on your staff to do volunteer
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.280]  work for you? Who's the best? Well, here's the problem. We don't have
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.400]  people. I mean, literally, Kevin ends up not being able to get a lot of his work done because
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:39.720]  he just sits there on the phone with people. And then a lot of folks want to volunteer.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.760]  I'm not saying you want to do this, but they really want to drink coffee and hang out. And
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.160]  they find out that I know you don't want to do that. But my point is, I don't have the
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:53.200]  organization. I'm not set up to deploy volunteers. And then I would be liable for what volunteers
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:58.320]  did. It also opens us up to infiltration. And I'm not saying you would want to infiltrate.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:03.880]  It's just that with the type of work we do, it's good to stay small and lean. And then
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:11.080]  basically I have to try to micromanage everything. But we're going to be creating something soon
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:18.520]  that is meant to turn volunteers loose, that is meant to empower you. And so we'll be talking
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.520]  about that in the near future.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:24.520]  I was thinking if you just had a research project that maybe you could...
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.880]  No, stuff like that is great, but here's the deal. I've got so much research and documents
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.080]  myself, I can't even cover it all. But I don't want to say don't do research because you
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:39.680]  guys discover new stuff all the time. And so, I mean, what area would you like to research?
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.080]  How would you like to help us?
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:45.960]  Well, anything. You know, if you've got a research project you want, like I can line
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:54.160]  up people for interviews, contact people that you want to contact and get a hold of and
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.160]  try and...
[01:19:55.160 --> 01:20:00.960]  Here's the thing about that. In the time it takes me to interface with you to get those
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:05.840]  people in the vet and confirm those interviews, I can do those interviews. We can set that
[01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:10.840]  up. So a lot of it's interface. You know what you need to do? Get Terror Storm, get martial
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:15.800]  law. I'm telling you, make copies of them. Spread links on the web. Don't wait for orders
[01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.020]  from headquarters. Go to the sound of the guns. But listen, I'm honored by your request
[01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:28.640]  to want to volunteer. I'm also not big on volunteering. I like to pay people because, you know, then
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:34.480]  there's no hard feelings.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:39.040]  The war on terrorism. Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home? If you
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:43.520]  are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter. So
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.480]  what do you do? Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout

[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:41.080]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book. The commodity markets like gold,
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:45.960]  silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year. This is a glaring testimony
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:51.840]  of how quickly the US dollar can be devalued. Many have turned to precious metals to provide
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:56.840]  a safe haven while increasing the potential profits. Though accumulating precious metals
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:01.320]  has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:06.200]  the market you are getting into. Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:11.760]  for only $27.95. The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:19.760]  coins. Call for your copy today. It's 800-686-2237. If you have already accumulated or applied
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.600]  to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:32.840]  Call 800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.

[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:43.840]  chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership? Did you know that the United Nations seeks
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:49.160]  power to control the environment, population, children and the whole world? They want to
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:54.320]  dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights. We would like to help you understand why these

[01:24:45.960 --> 01:25:09.960]  Thank you for watching.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:26.160]  Let's go to Mike in Texas now, and I'm going to talk about individual activism in the next
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:30.000]  segment to kind of expound on what Ron was saying.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.280]  Mike in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280]  Go ahead.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.480]  Yeah, first of all, I just wanted to say, Alex, I can't get your radio transmission
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.480]  here in South Austin.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.120]  I've been getting it for the last two and a half years on the same radio, and it's not
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.120]  coming through.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:47.680]  Those are the micro-FMs that, often on for like nine years, pick up different programs,
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.800]  and those are not on right now, but so that's the basics on that.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.240]  I really can't tell you anything else about it because I don't know.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.240]  Okay, that's fine.
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.240]  I'm just getting on my phone.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:59.600]  I recently emailed all my family and friends what I thought about the new old order, sort
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:02.640]  of came out of the closet, if you will, and George was saying, and of course, it's upset
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.640]  my father.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:10.000]  He sent me back an email from his, he's a priest, I mean a minister, and he sent back an email
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.120]  that's going around with him and his friends about this demonstration in London of a bunch
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.720]  of right out of central casting these Muslim extremists who are dressed up in the usual
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.160]  outfits holding the awkwardly worded sign.
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:25.720]  By the way, the government will never kick them out when they're saying, kill the police,
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:26.720]  kill everyone.
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.680]  Every time it gets exposed, they really work for British intelligence, but then they use
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.360]  the new laws to restrict everybody else's free speech.
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.840]  Right, and I'm trying to email my father back to my explanation of this, which is not going
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.760]  to believe it, but they're holding up signs that say, free them, go to hell, you know,
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:46.200]  and, you know, just, the Muslim is the only way.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:53.080]  Send him the article with the Nazi rally that they had in Florida a week and a half
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:59.400]  ago, there in Orlando being led by the FBI, and you can find other articles where these,
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:04.640]  quote, emoms, and we're not saying there aren't bad Muslims and bad groups out there either.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.160]  The point is, the globalists are funding and empowering and shepherding these groups.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:10.160]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:15.120]  I've got something I want to say to people that, I always have this, this is the basic
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.120]  thing.
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.480]  I can't believe that George Bush, to look how they smile, I can't believe they'd be
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:22.640]  doing anything like this in Bill Crystal and all, and you've got to say, have you ever
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:27.920]  spent time in a car lot with a used car salesman, I mean, of course they're going to smile
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:31.520]  and do, and of course they're going to be seemingly, well, I mean, there have been lots
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.600]  of serial killers that wear suits and ties and have short haircuts.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:38.760]  And that doesn't mean that they're good people, you have to look at their real actions.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:41.720]  Thank you for the call, Mike, I appreciate you holding.
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.240]  Let's talk to Alex in Florida.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.240]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.240]  Yes.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.240]  Go ahead.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.760]  Oh, okay, Alex, couple of quick points.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:51.440]  First of all, I want to thank you for all the work you've done on this Gardasil research.
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:52.440]  Thank you.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:57.440]  Using that research convinced my sister not to let my nieces get the injection, despite
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:02.400]  the urging of their so-called know-it-all pediatrician, and it was kind of funny because
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.480]  the day after she had had the argument with the pediatrician about getting it, they did
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:14.040]  an article on the ABC No News Tonight where their medical editor, Kim Johnson, was harping
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:18.320]  about how wonderful this thing is and how many lives it was going to save and if he
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:22.440]  had a daughter, he wouldn't hesitate to get her shot up with the stuff, and we all had
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:25.520]  a big laugh out of that because it's such transparent propaganda.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:28.920]  Good, so you're saving people's lives.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.360]  By the way, I have a newscast.
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:34.920]  We probably won't have time to play, but I hadn't seen it before.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.600]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:42.600]  Whoever did it played Pink Floyd music over it, and that's why we can't really play it.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.600]  Number one, it's too long.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.400]  Number two, the Pink Floyd Pink Floyd music's really too loud for radio, but you can still
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:55.000]  go watch it on Prison Planet, and it's Perry going, cancer killed 44,000 Texans.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  We've got to have this vaccine.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.760]  It's killed 44,000 in Texas.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.400]  But listen, this is how it works.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:11.840]  It really killed less than 200 in Texas, and that's the official number in the Associated
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.680]  Press in 2006, but this is how the lie works.
[01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.440]  All forms of cancer killed that many.
[01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:21.880]  You see, this is really a very rare cancer.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:25.600]  The amazing thing about guys like Perry is not that they're for sale, is that they're
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.600]  for sale so cheaply.
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:36.360]  Well, there were only 9,600, and I forget the exact number, it was 9,600 and something,
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.160]  total infections of the cancer in 2006.
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.160]  That was in the AP.
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.160]  Let me think.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:51.760]  2,000, excuse me, 9,617, 9,617 cases, the CDC reported, in the whole country.
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.880]  And less than 4,000 deaths.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:54.880]  Absolutely.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:58.640]  Well, the main thing I want to talk about is just a little bit of activism.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.040]  We started last night at my house.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:06.040]  My wife had her annual Academy Awards party, and we ended up not watching Academy Awards
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:09.400]  because a couple of the people started talking about this new video they saw on the Internet
[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:13.800]  called Lose Change, so I popped out my copy, and we all stopped watching that.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.440]  When it was time for the Academy Awards, I said, well, why don't you look at this?
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.240]  I brought out my new Terror Storm.
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:22.960]  Okay, there, I want to hear about this on the other side.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.240]  We're on the march.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:26.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:32.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:37.000]  The disciples asked Jesus and Matthew 24, what shall be the signs of thy coming and the end
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000]  of the world?
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.920]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, for nations shall rise against nations and
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:46.640]  kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:48.840]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:52.800]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom, but
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.960]  without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:31:00.600]  Second Peter says, we have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed,
[01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:05.200]  but first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:09.960]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, the Unholy Alliance.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:14.480]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.120]  You will receive information regarding America in Prophecy, Tyrants and Wars, the New World
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:20.640]  Order and much more.
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:23.360]  As always these materials are shipped to you with no charge.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:32.800]  Please call 1-888-211-1715, that's 1-888-211-1715 and ask for Packet B.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:37.200]  It's a fact, you can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been fraudulently created
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:42.480]  by the banks, since its creation in 1913 the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible
[01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.800]  for its own debt.
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:47.280]  So why should you the hardworking American be harassed for yours?
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.640]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt and unlike the
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:54.720]  Federal Reserve the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:59.640]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.160]  calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:04.840]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.200]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:13.440]  eliminated their credit card debt, instead of living each day in fear.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:15.520]  It's time to turn your life around.
[01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:28.920]  Call Day of Jubilee, open 9am-5pm CST at 920-293-8024, that's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert, don't
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:34.160]  wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:38.960]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network and I have an urgent message for our
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:39.960]  listeners.
[01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:44.240]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the
[01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.240]  world.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.240]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:52.400]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:57.240]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[01:32:57.240 --> 01:33:01.000]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:04.760]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:15.720]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238, that's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:24.480]  free reports, U.S. Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash, call 888-Zanadu, that's
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:35.440]  1-888-Xanadu, ask for George.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:58.680]  Welcome back, I want to let Alex and Florida finish up, Mario to Jessica, Mike, many others
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:02.280]  after we talked to Matt Dayton of Project Free American Citizens.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:05.560]  I just walked out during the break and told my radio producer, I said, hey, I don't have
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:06.560]  time to search for it.
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:12.480]  A caller earlier in the hour had asked about the name of the vaccines that are a live virus
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:16.880]  and attacks the brain to, quote, cure you of cigarette smoking, cure you of cocaine,
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:19.760]  methamphetamine, any type of narcotic.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.160]  They all hit the same receptor areas.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.880]  And he said, oh, I didn't hear you talk about that, but that was on the news last night.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.880]  Take the new vaccine.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.880]  It's approved.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.880]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:33.320]  It'll cure cigarette smoking.
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:35.080]  And I said, well, Kevin, what was it on?
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.400]  He said, local news.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:39.440]  So he thought it was on KVU.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.320]  He's off trying to, again, we're wallowing in this.
[01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:45.200]  And a caller called and asked, where is it?
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:46.200]  Where's the evidence?
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.680]  I've got him printing a bunch of articles about it right now.
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:53.600]  We type it into Google and just pages just popped up of it, how wonderful and how we
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.440]  all need it.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.600]  But then you read deeper, it's a live virus that attacks your brain.
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:02.480]  Yes, I said it correctly, a live virus that attacks your brain.
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:04.160]  Again, it's just reported calmly.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.080]  Oh, it's like mother's milk.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:09.440]  It's so good.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.440]  We are entering the ninth circle of hell.
[01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:15.440]  I mean, if you think it's bad now, folks, it's going to get crazier and weirder and
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:19.360]  nuttier by the minute.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.360]  And they have vaccine immunity.
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.880]  It doesn't matter how many tens of millions have got autism now.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:25.600]  It doesn't matter how many tens of millions get Alzheimer's from the aluminum and the
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:26.600]  rest of it.
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:27.600]  Doesn't matter.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.600]  Why?
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:33.160]  Because people won't wake up and stop trusting these killers.
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:37.120]  A lot of people just want to laugh at us and it's all funny.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.120]  Fine.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:41.720]  Go give your children a live virus vaccine for cancer.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:45.640]  Give them a live virus vaccine so they won't use drugs that the government ships in to
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:46.640]  begin with.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.560]  They're ruthless killers that funded Hitler in control.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.480]  They're using fancy high-tech PR to sell you.
[01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:56.280]  We're in a crisis.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.160]  Real fast, Alex in Florida.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:01.040]  So they heard a loose change, just why I love it.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:05.320]  And then you use that as a doorway to put Terror Storm on at this party instead of watching
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:06.600]  the Oscars.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.600]  What ended up happening?
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.600]  Well, I ended up giving away all five of my new copies of Terror Storm that I ordered
[01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.880]  a couple of weeks ago and now I've got to get some new ones.
[01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:17.840]  But I hear people calling all the time, Alex, what can I do?
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:18.840]  How can I help?
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.840]  It's real simple.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:24.560]  For 50 bucks, you can get five copies of Terror Storm with a nice DVD cover and a pretty
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.560]  graphics.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:28.200]  All you could do is get some of those and get them away.
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:32.680]  Making copies is great, but I tell you what, people, when they see the nice graphics and
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:39.200]  the professional cover and the beautifully pressed DVD, it elevates the credibility just
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.200]  that much more.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.200]  Well, it does.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.320]  And then we end up making a few bucks off that when you buy them at $9.95 a piece.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:48.400]  I still haven't paid off the cost of that film.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:52.080]  And if I keep going like this, I've looked in about a year and a half, I'll be broke,
[01:36:52.080 --> 01:36:54.920]  but I probably just put out the next film for free, too.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:00.280]  But it just doesn't, I just want to get it out to people and folks like you, Alex, that
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:04.600]  do buy five copies or 10 copies, you make it all possible.
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:08.880]  You fund, I mean, look, I've been so busy today, I spent, what, 30 seconds at the start
[01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:11.280]  of the shower saying, hey, buy our video, support us.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:13.520]  I've gotten around, I don't even plug our products anymore.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:17.800]  I'm so busy wanting to interview all these people and talk to you and warn folks and
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:18.800]  cover the news.
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.360]  So yes, go to infowars.com and get a bunch of copies of Terror Storm, American Freedom
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.400]  to Fascism, you name it, thank you, Alex.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:26.400]  You're welcome.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:27.400]  Thank you.
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.520]  And that's the type of activism we need right there.
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:33.960]  And again, for earlier callers who want to help us, I just don't have the capacity to
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:37.000]  tell volunteers what to do or have it be effective.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.200]  And just the interfacing with you and talking, I don't have time to hardly see my family.
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:42.560]  I'm not whining about it.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:47.840]  We don't do as good a job we could because it just gets crazy.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.200]  So much is going on.
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:53.200]  That's why here's the deal.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.560]  Chairman Keen came to town last year of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, and I could have
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.920]  gone up there and made big headlines and asked the best questions and yelled at him about
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:06.280]  covering up the implosion of WTC7, and I knew it'd be big, but I just sent a couple of my
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:10.000]  guys here from the office there and Bob Dacey went, and then that's going to be in a loose
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.960]  change final edition.
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:14.160]  And I knew full well that'd be an important video.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.920]  David Gergen's coming to town this Thursday.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.760]  I don't think I'm going to go down and confront him.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.160]  That's for other people to do, other people to get the spotlight, other people to be leaders,
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:23.160]  other people to rise.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.040]  That's what we have to do to win here.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.560]  I don't relish the spotlight.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.280]  I don't relish having to do all this.
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:35.200]  I'll be on the air eight hours today doing interviews, two hours of TV, three hours here,
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:39.080]  two hours of rents, and another hour, eight hours.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:45.360]  And again, I do that because it's having an effect, but I try to get my people that work
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.320]  here to do interviews and they don't like it.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:49.360]  I try to get Paul Watson to do them.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.640]  Again, I'd like to see you start a website and then see you doing interviews and you
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.280]  getting linked and you having an effect.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:58.280]  That's how we're going to win.
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.800]  If it's just a couple of us, they can beat us.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.360]  They can kill our leadership.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:03.600]  This is an idea.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:06.240]  Ideas are bulletproof, as V says.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:08.360]  You cannot stop an idea.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:13.320]  And to see two young college students who in the last year, I guess, from founding project
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:19.600]  for New American Citizen, have had, I don't know, 20, 30 rallies, huge polls filled with
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:23.080]  500 to 900 people, massive effect.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:24.640]  They've been all over the news.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:29.720]  They did two things this weekend, Friday and Sunday, and joining us is Matt Dayton to talk
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:31.720]  about what they did.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.200]  And again, and they've gone in and helped us research Bilderberg Group and helped get
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:38.760]  us news articles for this film I'm making.
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:42.920]  They give us some of the photos and video graciously and then we combine and collaborate
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.280]  and get it up on the website.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:47.200]  This is the type of volunteering I need.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:50.840]  Where here it is, not just the raw footage, it's been boiled down to 10 minutes.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:52.160]  Here's the photos.
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:53.160]  Here's an article.
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.880]  Write articles for us, folks, if they're decent, I'll post them.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.480]  Give us material.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:59.600]  We'll try to build you up.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.880]  Let me go to Matt Dayton, who I know is down there at college right now.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:03.880]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:07.200]  Matt, tell us what happened Friday with Barack Obama.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:09.440]  This is round three as we're exposing him.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.320]  And then tell us about the demolition of the Intel building and how you guys use that as
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.320]  another platform to expose 9-Eleven.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.440]  Oh, well, first let me thank for bringing me on again, Alex.
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.280]  Yeah, I'll start with the Barack event.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:28.360]  Well, I mean, we knew cameras were going to be there.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:34.040]  We knew it was going to be a huge event and I decided it would be a good idea to just
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:38.320]  take a sign down there and see if I could get it on camera.
[01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:40.480]  So basically, that's what I did.
[01:40:40.480 --> 01:40:43.520]  I saw where all the video cameras were lined up.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.560]  I saw where Barack was going to be speaking.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:54.400]  And so I positioned myself in between and sort of put my neck out there, alienate myself
[01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:56.760]  from the masses of people.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:59.280]  I don't know if you've seen the pictures, but it's just...
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:04.800]  Yes, thousands of people in a sea of Barack Obama signs handed out to them all scripted.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:08.160]  Here's this huge Investigate 9-Eleven poster right in front of him.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:13.720]  Yeah, I mean, and what images are the most powerful thing that we have, it's all about...
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.320]  I mean, that's what they use against us, these photo ops, these PR events.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:25.440]  And so if we can just do that in reverse and sort of stage events like the Barack Obama
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.960]  and get photos like that out there, I think it can be effective.
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.080]  And my mom did a fantastic job taking the pictures and my friend did the filming and
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:44.800]  it was on News 8 and thousands of people saw the banner and it was a great experience.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.200]  And I encourage...
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:51.280]  I would really like for people out there to try and go to those rallies and whenever
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:55.160]  Barack Obama or any other candidate come to their town, just bring banners, find where
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160]  the cameras are.
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.040]  Obviously, he's a total new world order.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:41:59.320]  People are like, is he good?
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:03.520]  If the national media is telling you he's the man, he's bad news, just like Hillary
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.160]  or Newt Gennrich or any of them.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.600]  But tell folks what happened with the media hissing at you, flipping you off, getting
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:10.600]  mad.
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:11.600]  Tell folks what happened.
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:17.320]  Well, I planned to put up a sign right when he was coming out because I knew that's when
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:20.200]  that was going to be the most usable footage for them.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:25.080]  And so right when he was coming out, I just put my banner up and just held it there for
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:26.240]  a couple of minutes.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:32.560]  And I was just looking at all the news media people and just see their faces turning red.
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:36.680]  One lady was pointing towards the ground, get your sign out of the way.
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:39.520]  Another lady was fumbling with her camera and flicking me off.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.080]  It was actually quite hilarious.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.760]  Now let's be clear.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:47.920]  At a rally where people could bring whatever signs they wanted, the mindset of the average
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.000]  American and the media is hissing how dare you not be part of the group thing, how dare
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.160]  you ruin something precious.
[01:42:55.160 --> 01:43:02.080]  You need to stop your speech, stop your communication, stop your First Amendment.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:04.400]  Stop being able to express yourself.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:10.160]  How dare you, Matt Dayton, engage in such al-Qaeda-esque activity.
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.160]  This is so un-American.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.840]  And so, yeah, I kept doing it.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:19.120]  I would put it up every time they would put up all the Barack Obama banner would go up.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.360]  And finally, some lady came down there and was just like, your sign is really, really
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.360]  in the way.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:28.560]  And I was like, I know, she's like, well, we're just trying to do our job.
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:29.880]  And I was like, so am I.
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:34.600]  Yeah, lady, you're the media there to not control the event.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:38.440]  You're the media there to shoot video of what happened.
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:40.640]  Don't you understand that?
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.640]  Don't you understand?
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:43.040]  I mean, what's wrong with them?
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.040]  Yeah.
[01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:45.040]  So she...
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.360]  What news station was this idiot with?
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:49.320]  I'm not sure what she was, but she was a photographer.
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:52.240]  So she stepped in front of me because she couldn't get any good pictures.
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:53.240]  Now let's understand.
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:43:56.720]  You're about three, four people back from the stage.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.240]  I'd say you have to sign up about as high as his knees.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:05.760]  You weren't blocking the precious dear freshman senator, junior senator.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.760]  You were there engaging in the First Amendment.
[01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:09.480]  How dare you?
[01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:12.640]  I'm surprised they didn't come over and say there's a free speech zone over here.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:14.640]  We decide which is speech and which isn't.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:21.360]  Yeah, people, you could hear the sort of murmur around me and somebody mentioned something
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:25.520]  to me, but I was like, good thing I live in America that I can do this just real sarcastically
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:28.000]  because they were basically attacking me like...
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:34.280]  I'm happy, I'm lucky, he's communicating, oh my gosh, we've got to shut down the First
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:35.280]  Amendment.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:39.040]  And Newt Gingrich is saying, man, the First Amendment, all over national TV, they're saying
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:43.440]  arrest all of us, we're traitors, members of Congress who have an opinion on the war,
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.080]  evil, you're not supposed to have opinions, just submit to them.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.840]  Submit to the new America.
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:50.840]  Yeah, good.
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.000]  And then after that lady came down, she stepped in front of me, got her pictures, and then
[01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:00.480]  another guy came down and was just, we really can't get any good pictures, can you take
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.480]  it down?
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:04.840]  And I'll think about it.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:10.920]  Of course, I would put it down and then put it back up, I didn't want to be mobbed.
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:15.200]  But that would have been better, but that's what fake liberals do, they kind of come and
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.240]  peck on you and start grabbing on you, come on, let's be friends, let's talk about it
[01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:23.200]  out of here, come on, it's all right, it's all, come on, I've seen them at 9-11 events
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.480]  where they're having world can't wait stuff, and somebody tries to ask a question, they
[01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:32.280]  all mobbing, stop being, get him, body snatchers, don't let him, but you ought to be around
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:37.200]  the icons, they'll start going, get out of here, call me, you ought to be put in a camp,
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.200]  I'll listen to Savage.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:45.680]  Well, then I did it again, and the lady who had come down at the beginning tried to physically
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.840]  force my arms down, and I think-
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.640]  You should have called the police there at that time.
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:55.240]  No, I just smiled, it was on News 8, you can see her trying to pull my arms down, and
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.040]  we just, laughing because it was very-
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:01.160]  We're going to post that in an article about this, so now you have them physically grabbing
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:04.120]  on you, who was she with?
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.240]  I'm not sure, it was the same lady who came down, it was-
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:15.560]  Stop him, he's defaming our leader, who saved us from Bush, what else happened?
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:21.960]  That's about it, we put the banner up every time the other signs came up, and we were
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:26.920]  pretty successful as far as getting the pictures that we wanted, and getting the video that
[01:46:26.920 --> 01:46:32.720]  we sent over to y'all, and then News 8, I got tons of people calling me, like, so you
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.720]  on News 8?
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:38.560]  Yeah, all the other news, because we watched it, my staff did, was able to shoot from weird
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:41.800]  angles and cut the banner out.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:45.400]  Now there was some other 9-11 banners, we saw one that said 9-11's an inside job, that
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:46.400]  was a pretty good one.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:51.600]  Right, I didn't even see that guy, I mean, there was very few people there, who had any
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:54.360]  sort of 9-11 true banners, but-
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.240]  What did you say when this woman started grabbing you?
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.040]  I want to say that's assault, and that gets their hands off you real quick, and so you
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:03.760]  want to be firm with them because they'll go ahead and assault you, and then call the
[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:08.680]  cops out, and then say you assaulted them, so it's very important to say that's assault,
[01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:13.320]  stop now before you go to jail, and just talk to them like children, they're children, they'll
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:17.160]  take the brain-eating vaccine, they'll do whatever they're told.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.840]  They would march into gas chambers, man, they'll do whatever they're told.
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:25.640]  Now let's shift gears and talk about, well, anything else that happened at that event,
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:28.800]  because then I want to talk about the control demolition downtown when they blew up the
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:29.800]  building.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:37.400]  No, I mean, I think that's about it, we got help getting a press pass to get up and get
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:39.160]  those pictures from that angle.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:47.080]  Yeah, you're right in front of the big computer building that they never finished because
[01:47:47.080 --> 01:47:52.840]  Intel pulled out, so they just built the big concrete steel skeleton, and it's been there
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:58.120]  since the dot-com bus in the late 90s, and so you've got images of a big sign saying
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:47:59.120]  control demolition.
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:02.120]  Tell folks what signs you had, what happened there.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.480]  Well we just, we brought a one that says control demolition, real big, bold letters, and underneath
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:11.760]  it it says Wilter Center 1, Wilter Center 2, and Wilter Center 7, and so me and another
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:17.720]  guy named Clayton grabbed that banner and held it up in front of the whole crowd, walked
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:21.560]  up and down the crowd, showing that banner before the demolition.
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.040]  Did you get video of that?
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.920]  Yes, I believe we do.
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:28.360]  Clayton's got to get it over here, I'm salivating.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:31.840]  We've got to get that video up ASAP, man, come on, bring it down.
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:36.840]  Okay, I'd like to play that on my TV show tonight, because I'll be live on TV tonight,
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.520]  if you could drop that by, it shows earlier now, it's 6 to 7, if you could get over there
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.000]  by like 5.30 or so, if it was on a mini-DV or a format I could play, we would just play
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  it raw off the tape.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:51.040]  Yeah, I need to see, I haven't actually gone back and looked at the footage since I was
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:52.640]  holding the banner, so...
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:58.480]  Well I've seen the stills and you've got the building blowing up with the signs, and that's
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:48:59.480]  it.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:00.480]  Tell folks about your website.
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:08.080]  Our website is PNACitizens.org, it's just a blog right now, we're working on a...
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.640]  PNACitizens.org, and we're grabbing all that and posting it on jonesreport.com, the Obama
[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:17.000]  footage is going up too, that'll be up by this evening as well.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:21.560]  And speaking of confrontations, I just wanted to let everyone know that Carl Rove is actually
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:32.400]  going to be speaking at the Texas State University at 11 a.m., I believe in Evans Auditorium,
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.640]  so that's tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.840]  Now that's the one in Georgetown, right?
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:38.720]  In Georgetown, no, in San Marcos.
[01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:43.120]  Okay, I got them backwards, they changed the name of the San Marcos one, I'm brain dead.
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:46.920]  Okay, so what's the name again?
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:47.920]  That is Evans Auditorium.
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:50.800]  So they don't call it Southwest Texas anymore, they call it...
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.800]  Texas State, I believe.
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.800]  That's why I got confused, yeah.
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:57.280]  Okay, and that's at Evans Auditorium at 11 a.m. tomorrow?
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:58.280]  Are you going to be down there?
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:00.200]  I'm going to try to make it.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.920]  I want to get another...
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:05.680]  What I originally wanted to do with the Bill Crystal event was do the same thing that we
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:10.560]  did with Obama and just get that image of a banner, something with him in the background,
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.200]  you know, just maybe like Tyrant.
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:16.840]  Well, you also want to yell 9-11's an inside job and hear one of the architects.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:18.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:23.240]  Because those guys put on this arrogant front that they control reality and we're all just
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.720]  sitting on the sidelines.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.720]  That's not the case.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.280]  Tomorrow, 11 a.m. folks, everybody get in there with your little video cameras, get
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.960]  them out and people need to be there tomorrow.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:35.960]  Austin's becoming...
[01:50:35.960 --> 01:50:39.320]  And this whole Central Texas is becoming such a mecca for politics.
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:42.080]  I tell you, these snakes are here almost every week now.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:45.560]  So yeah, we just got to capitalize on those events.
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:50.160]  You know, I was on the news two times in one weekend and all you have to do is just enter
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:54.640]  and get out there and know where the stories are happening.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:57.000]  One good thing to do is you can just have a little bullhorn them.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.320]  When they go to live news feed, you can also bullhorn them.
[01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:02.320]  That upsets them.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:03.320]  Absolutely.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:08.320]  One time they were having a fake bio attack and I, down at the DPS when I went down there
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.640]  and told them it was staged, they had to admit it was staged later.
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:12.640]  They didn't like that.
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:16.440]  All right, so what were people saying and doing as you held up big signs saying controlled
[01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:17.440]  demolition?
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:21.960]  Oh, well, we actually got a good, we got a good response for, you know, at the beginning,
[01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:25.880]  we got several claps, but then after we were holding it up for a while, people were going
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:31.440]  boo, don't hold that kind of, you're blocking our view of the real controlled demolition.
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:32.440]  They didn't want to...
[01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.440]  Stay there.

[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:40.240]  This year, after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, mighty film Terror Storm
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:41.240]  is complete.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:44.960]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:49.640]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:54.640]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.040]  London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:53:01.320]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:07.960]  disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information and much,
[01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:08.960]  much more.
[01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:12.800]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.040]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:19.520]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:04.520]  it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:54:04.520 --> 01:54:08.320]  It even reduces radon 2-22 lead and other heavy metals.
[01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:12.600]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one
[01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:15.680]  to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:54:15.680 --> 01:54:18.160]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:57.640]  From the next hour I'm going to play the clip of the NIST director saying that they haven't
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:01.040]  done any scientific research about why the towers fell because they know why they fell.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:05.400]  There was no molten steel, and we cut to all these clips of firefighters saying it.
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:08.800]  And it was Matt Dayton and his colleagues that put that together as well, and they played
[01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:12.600]  that before I spoke to a packed house over 900 at UT.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:15.360]  So this is how you take action.
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:18.800]  What else happened whenever you held up the big sign that said control demolition?
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:19.920]  And I haven't been watching the news.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:20.920]  You're saying that also?
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.920]  Made it on the news?
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:30.040]  Yeah, there was some live footage going on at the event, and I had my investigate 9-11.
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:33.240]  I haven't actually seen the footage, but some people said they could definitely see it in
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:35.160]  the background holding up our sign.
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.640]  So I know they didn't play that footage again.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:41.880]  Everywhere they go, every opportunity that's all they see is 9-11 truth, and it's happening
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:43.200]  all over the nation.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.680]  But we're leading the fight here.
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:46.560]  You're on the vanguard, my friend.
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:47.560]  Absolutely.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.560]  Absolutely.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:53.880]  I also wanted to let you listeners know that tonight we're having an event in the UT Union
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:54.880]  Ballroom at 7.30.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:01.720]  We're screening a film called Truth Be Told, and also with a short lecture by Hank Gilbert.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:05.840]  So if anyone's interested in that, that'll be 7.30 tonight in the Union.
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:07.360]  What's the truth be told about?
[01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:17.320]  Truth be told about is, I guess it's basically exposing the trans-Sexus Corridor and the
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:23.280]  Toll Road, but I believe it features mostly in San Antonio, but just getting information
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:25.400]  out there to people about that.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:26.400]  Good.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:32.160]  Hey, great job, and I hope that somebody gets down there to confront his lordship, the real
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:38.200]  head of the White House, Carl Rowe, tomorrow, and then we've got here at UT David Gergen
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:39.440]  coming up on Thursday.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:40.440]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:41.440]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:42.440]  You bet.
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:45.000]  We also have some clips from 60 Minutes Concerning the War.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  I want to get into Iran.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.280]  I'll get through all these callers that have been holding the longest first, like Jessica,
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:56.840]  Mike, Melody, Dan, Johnny, and others, but I've got to move quick, so be ready with
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:57.840]  your calls.

[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:38.400]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:39.400]  You want answers?
[02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:48.880]  Well so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:49.880]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:49.880 --> 02:00:55.640]  All right, this third hour will be completely jam-packed, massive Iran news, multi-faceted
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:56.640]  report.
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:03.840]  I also want to report on Iraq and place some clips from a spin piece off 60 Minutes and
[02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:05.680]  so much more.
[02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:08.720]  Right now though, let's get calls out of the way they've been holding the longest.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:11.440]  Jessica in Utah, thanks for holding.
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:12.440]  You're on the air.
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.800]  Hi, I actually wanted to thank you first for waking me up.
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:21.400]  I had just like barely watched her storm a couple weeks ago and I ended up having to
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:26.840]  go buy five copies and give them away, but I'm really having problems with people watching
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:27.840]  it.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:30.840]  They just don't seem interested.
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:36.600]  Tell them it's video of Jessica Simpson shaving her head in the water.
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:40.320]  Yeah, and it's just like amazing.
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.520]  Are you trying to get family to watch it?
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.360]  I told my brother about the website and I've passed it along a couple coworkers, but it
[02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:50.120]  just seems like they're just not interested.
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:51.800]  What kind of business do you work in?
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:56.040]  I actually work with fasteners, nuts, bolts, and screws.
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:59.240]  Well, I mean, look, a lot of people are just thinking about what they're going to drink
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:03.200]  at the bar tonight or how to give more money to drive a more fancy car because that will
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:06.200]  fulfill them, they think.
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:11.000]  You'll find pockets of either we get a caller saying, everybody's waking up, I talked to,
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.320]  or they're saying nobody's waking up and it just seems the luck of the draw, which area
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:17.320]  you're in.
[02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:23.160]  I mean, I go on stations like Ktalk and every caller calls in agreeing, they have huge 9-11
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:25.720]  truth meetings up there in Utah.
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:26.720]  Where are you in Utah?
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:28.720]  I'm actually in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:32.280]  Yeah, I mean, it may just be who you're around.
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:33.280]  How do you approach them?
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:36.720]  Do you say, hey, here's a film about the government being behind 9-11?
[02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:41.880]  And, you know, that there's other facts in it, too, about, you know, the Gulf of Tonka
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:46.760]  and just, you know, other things that I think they should know about, but it's kind of,
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:48.120]  I guess, not that important.
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:53.320]  Well, a lot of people also take some, I mean, if you just talk about politics, a lot of
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:55.920]  people go, what are you doing trying to show off?
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:58.000]  Look, we got one that can read.
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:02:59.000]  Yeah.
[02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:04.200]  Look, she even walks on her hind legs, not bent over like a gorilla.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:05.200]  Yeah.
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:06.200]  She's probably with Alcada.
[02:03:06.200 --> 02:03:12.560]  So, I would just move on, I mean, it's unfortunate to run it, I mean, all five people you approached
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:13.560]  didn't want to see it.
[02:03:13.560 --> 02:03:17.960]  Well, one hasn't returned the video yet, but I haven't, not sure if they watched it, and
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:18.960]  I've given nine others one.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:21.240]  And the other just said, no, no, no, that's...
[02:03:21.240 --> 02:03:23.760]  Yeah, that it's not real, you know, it's not believable.
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:26.760]  Well, that's because deep down they're afraid.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:30.320]  And so, you might just try another approach and say, man, these are really interesting
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:31.320]  film.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:32.320]  You ought to check it out.
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.800]  But look, things are so bad that you have to have that attitude.
[02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:42.320]  You see, if you're not going to fight this and you're not going to admit that we're losing
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:46.440]  our freedoms in America's in bad shape, I mean, I know Yuppies email me and I've heard
[02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:47.440]  them on the street.
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:54.680]  They go, the dollar's not devalued, you know, sure it is, Alex, oh, and the Martian's going
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:55.680]  to get me.
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:02.160]  And I go, no, no, here's the Times of London, oh, sure it is, oh, yeah.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:08.680]  You know, again, their cowards, deep down they know it's true, they can't deal with
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:14.920]  that, they're so afraid that they just go, no, no, no, no, no, so just move on.
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:21.760]  Now, I hope this is okay with you, but I have InfoWars and Prism Planet posted in my car
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:22.760]  window.
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:23.760]  Good, of course it's okay.
[02:04:23.760 --> 02:04:28.840]  And it says 9-11 is an inside job and to visit this website and I get so many different
[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.360]  looks and I think it's getting somewhere.
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:34.560]  Do people ever honk or wave at you?
[02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:40.640]  Oh, no, no, unfortunately, no, but I do see in the rear view of people writing it down
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:44.560]  or, you know, really reading it, I've seen people roll their eyes, so.
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:50.720]  No, she thinks the government might be bad, how on America, no.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:54.560]  But I was just wondering if that's okay to post your websites like that.
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:58.400]  Number one, even if I didn't want you to, which I do want you to, it's a free country,
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:03.480]  free speech, you can post whatever you want, please do it.
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:06.320]  But people call me all the time and say, is this okay?
[02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:08.120]  Of course it's okay.
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:11.840]  But even if I didn't want you to, it's your right to do it, please do it.
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:17.040]  And I'm sorry to hear that you're having bad luck there, but just continue, a lot of people
[02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:22.520]  that laugh at you now, later when the cops beat their kid up or something, they'll come
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:23.520]  back to you.
[02:05:23.520 --> 02:05:26.640]  Okay, they just think they're part of the system right now, they haven't woken up yet,
[02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:28.640]  we'll be right back.
[02:05:28.640 --> 02:05:37.160]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.160]  is complete.
[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:41.880]  Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:46.560]  terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:51.560]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:54.000]  London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.280]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:04.600]  disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information,
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:05.600]  and much, much more.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.720]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:11.920]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:16.440]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:34.600]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with a Sport Berkey filtration bottle,
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:39.400]  ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in
[02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:44.920]  your glove box so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:48.240]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:52.200]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:56.360]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:07:01.600]  it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:07:01.600 --> 02:07:05.380]  It even reduces radon 222 lead and other heavy metals.
[02:07:05.380 --> 02:07:09.680]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:12.760]  to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:34.520]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine
[02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:35.520]  glass?
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:37.160]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:07:37.160 --> 02:07:40.800]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the
[02:07:40.800 --> 02:07:43.880]  vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:47.560]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Reif discovered that disease organisms can
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:50.120]  be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:07:50.120 --> 02:07:54.720]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:57.800]  of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:03.040]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:06.800]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:10.680]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:13.360]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:15.920]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:21.560]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:25.240]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:30.240]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:32.680]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:41.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:54.440]  During the break, we were googling for articles concerning vaccines that quote, cure you of
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:09:00.680]  drug addiction because they burn holes in your brain to put it lightly.
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:07.160]  Here's the Associated Press though, this is FDA OK's Pfizer anti-smoking pill and this
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.680]  creates a protein that blocks it in the brain but it also blocks your normal endorphins.
[02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:20.400]  We did find an article here, this is a press release from news-medical.net put out by the
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:29.080]  Pharmacological News by Zenova Group, PLC, new vaccine to stop cocaine addiction.
[02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:32.840]  The good articles are the London Independent and the London Telegraph, remember those, we've
[02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:33.840]  got to find them.
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:37.760]  When something's two years old, it's like buried and searched, you know, 30 or something
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:46.080]  deep in there but has announced the presentation of results of two-dose escalation phase two
[02:09:46.080 --> 02:09:51.280]  studies of TACD, it has its experimental name, a vaccine being developed with a treatment
[02:09:51.280 --> 02:09:57.320]  of cocaine addiction at the College on Problems of Drug Dependence, 66th annual scientific
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:05.120]  meeting in Puerto Rico, June 12th at the 17th presentation by Dr. Bridgett Martwell and
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:12.320]  this is all just a scientific write-up on it and what it does.
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:18.960]  And it says, results from both studies show that the maximum mean antibody response occurred
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:24.800]  between 70 and 90 days post-vaccination with specific cocaine antibodies persisting for
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:26.680]  at least 16 months.
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:31.440]  What happens is it causes an autoimmune response in the brain and so plaques form blocking
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:34.080]  it and it kills those cells.
[02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.960]  Eight subjects also received a booster, 15 to 18 months post-vaccination, all of them
[02:10:37.960 --> 02:10:42.720]  showed an increased levels of antibodies so that's their proof.
[02:10:42.720 --> 02:10:45.960]  That's a basic sign, the best one was in the independent, I remember two years ago and
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:51.280]  it talked about how it attacked the brain, that was quite useful but we'll dig all those
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:53.680]  up and repost them because I said we would.
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:59.280]  I know they're in our format on our own sites, you've got to remember the exact headline
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:03.320]  name and Kevin was in there for like an hour trying because he didn't have the exact headline.
[02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:10.040]  I came up with the exact headline from memory but found newer articles that people use the
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:15.520]  same headline with, like new vaccine to stop cocaine addiction, try new vaccine to stop
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:23.360]  drug addiction, new vaccine promises to fight drug use, there's a bunch there that go from
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:24.360]  memory on.
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:28.360]  Alright, let's go back to the calls as promised.
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:34.560]  Let's go ahead now and take a call from Mike in Toronto, Canada, go ahead sir.
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:39.480]  Hey Alex, great to talk to you, a long time listener, first time caller.
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:40.480]  Welcome.
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:44.800]  There's been some big news that I'm surprised that none of your other callers have mentioned
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:50.480]  and it concerns Building 7 and the fact that the BBC on their World Service reported that
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:58.960]  Building 7 had collapsed at 4.57pm which of course is a full 23 minutes before it actually
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:11:59.960]  did.
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:00.960]  Do you have that clip?
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:01.960]  I do.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:07.600]  All you need to do is go to Google Video, type in Building, the number 7 and BBC.
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:09.000]  Hold on, let me write this down.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:17.120]  It's very simple, just type in Building, then a space, the digit 7 and then BBC and you
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:18.120]  will get a clip.
[02:12:18.120 --> 02:12:19.120]  Okay, you're good.
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:20.120]  Go slower.
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:22.240]  Go slower so I can write this down.
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:23.240]  Okay.
[02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:24.240]  Okay.
[02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:25.240]  Google Video.
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:28.120]  Yeah, Google Video, then what do you type in?
[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:29.120]  Building.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.120]  Okay.
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:32.240]  Then a space, the number 7.
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.640]  So a space, no dash.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:35.040]  Nope, just a space.
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.040]  Okay, Building 7.
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:37.040]  And another space, BBC.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:46.520]  If you touch that, you will find a rather interesting clip that was taken from the big, huge internet
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:52.600]  archive that has apparently just been made public of all sorts of media coverage of that
[02:12:52.600 --> 02:12:53.600]  day.
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:59.200]  And someone, and I don't know who, has gone and just watched all the BBC coverage from
[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:02.920]  that day and was astonished to see that they reported that Building 7, and they refer to
[02:13:02.920 --> 02:13:07.000]  it as the Solomon Salomon Brothers building.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.040]  That's how it was also known.
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:13.920]  And what's even more incredible is that at the top of the clock, at 5 o'clock, they continue
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:19.040]  to announce that Building 7 has collapsed, and they go to a live hit with a BBC reporter,
[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:22.840]  a woman in New York with the skyline behind her.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:25.720]  And she continues to say that Building 7 has collapsed.
[02:13:25.720 --> 02:13:26.720]  And you can see it.
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:28.480]  You can see Building 7 right behind her.
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:29.480]  This is massive.
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:30.480]  This is massive.
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:31.480]  This is massive.
[02:13:31.480 --> 02:13:32.480]  Hey, Kevin, get Aaron in here.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:34.560]  In case he's not listening, I'm going to have him grab it.
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:35.880]  In fact, the network can.
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:41.560]  John, can you go to Google, click on the video link and type in Building 7 BBC?
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:43.520]  Oh, he already had it.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.760]  How far in does this happen?
[02:13:45.760 --> 02:13:46.760]  Or is it a medium?
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:51.960]  Well, the clip that you'll get as your first hit on Google video is a little kind of explanation
[02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.480]  of this that someone has put together with an introduction and everything.
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.680]  And it just points out where Building 7 is as the woman is telling you it's collapsed.
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:00.680]  At 5.15...
[02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:03.080]  How long has this been up?
[02:14:03.080 --> 02:14:04.080]  Since yesterday.
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:05.080]  Okay.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:06.080]  That's why someone would mention it.
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:07.080]  Okay.
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:09.960]  Call Watson, get an article out on ASAP, emergency article, emergency.
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:15.720]  A guy named, who goes by the name of Shure, nicknamed Shure, his name is Jeff and he lives
[02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:19.000]  up in Sudbury, I think, up here in Canada.
[02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:20.480]  He's already called the BBC.
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:23.000]  Oh, he's already called their Lordships.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.720]  I wonder how they'll deal with this.
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:28.440]  He's asked them, can you account for the fact that you announced that Building 7 had collapsed
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:30.760]  23 minutes before it actually did?
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:32.640]  And of course, they're just totally flustered.
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:36.400]  Well, this is the type of call we need because we're not omnipresent.
[02:14:36.400 --> 02:14:37.560]  People think we know everything.
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:38.760]  We don't know very much.
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:43.360]  We're always trying to learn more and it's almost always you, the listeners, that point
[02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:44.360]  all this out to us.
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:45.360]  But let me just go back.
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:48.680]  This fits in with what I've already confirmed before I ever saw the clip, which we're about
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:49.680]  to play.
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:52.520]  You can just stream it right off there if you want, John.
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:53.520]  I'm going to have to save it.
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.760]  Go ahead and save it afterwards.
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:57.000]  And folks, grab that.
[02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:58.880]  Grab it before they take it down.
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:02.480]  But because believe me, they'll try to sponge this very quickly if it's accurate as you're
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.600]  saying and I didn't believe you because this is what happened.
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:06.840]  Well, let me just finish.
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:10.680]  I mean, this is a really important call, but I want to elaborate and then tell you finish
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:12.200]  your point, then I'll say something.
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:13.200]  Okay.
[02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:18.320]  Just very quickly, this guy, Jeff, in Sudbury had actually called the BBC, asked them about
[02:15:18.320 --> 02:15:20.560]  this because he saw it early this morning.
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:24.080]  And he has now put the recording of his phone call to the BBC on the net.
[02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:26.000]  So people are really onto this.
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:30.200]  The thing that needs to be made clear is that even if they take this particular clip off
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:37.040]  Google video, the source of the video itself is from the big internet archive.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:39.800]  All right, I'm calling Paul Watson right now as you talk.
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:40.800]  Just continue.
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:41.800]  Okay.
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:46.840]  So in other words, although it's too late, I mean, the cat is out of the bag, someone
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:49.440]  may try and take this particular, it's a 25.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:51.160]  Hold on one second.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.440]  I got Paul Watson here.
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.560]  Hey, Paul, the BBs, you're already listening?
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:00.000]  You were already listening or did you already know about it?
[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000]  Well done.
[02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:02.000]  I'll call you back.
[02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000]  Get it up.
[02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000]  Get a blurb up.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  ASAP.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  Get it in our format before they snatch it.
[02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000]  Thank you.
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000]  Yeah.
[02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  All right.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000]  We want to link to the Google video.
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000]  It's a 25 minute and 43 second clip.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:15.320]  This particular assembly, but the original clip is like all the internet archive clips
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:16.320]  of footage that day.
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:17.320]  No, I understand.
[02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:22.480]  Just back on September 11th, the BBC singing in all of them, quote, release their entire
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:23.480]  archives.
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:26.160]  Sir, I appreciate your call and I appreciate the info.
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:27.160]  All right.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:30.160]  Let me comment on what he just said.
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:34.160]  The reason this makes sense is in any of you, and we're still developing this big special
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:38.960]  with all these first responders and eyewitnesses and all the clips, the problem is we're now
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:41.600]  with over 70 clips.
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:46.360]  And so I've got to spend hours and hours collating them and telling the network which clips to
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:47.360]  play in an order.
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:48.600]  I rarely script shows.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:52.760]  I'll have to heavily script it because I'll be go to clip one, go to clip two, go to clip
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:53.760]  three.
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:55.920]  There's a lot of the clips the network hasn't gotten yet.
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:58.200]  They've got to put it all in one folder.
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.560]  We literally have 70 plus clips of them saying, get back, they're going to blow the building
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:04.200]  up, get back, firefighters saying they're going to blow it.
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:10.440]  They said, get back, police saying it, people saying it after the fact.
[02:17:10.440 --> 02:17:11.640]  This is the problem.
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:14.560]  And this goes back to 9-11.
[02:17:14.560 --> 02:17:16.200]  I get a call.
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:17.200]  I'm in the shower.
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:20.440]  I tend to get up, do research, then take a shower.
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.720]  It was like, you know, eight something in the morning, the first plane it hit.
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:25.920]  I get a call.
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:28.000]  I come running out, dripping.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.480]  I turn on the television.
[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:30.480]  There it is.
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:33.040]  I start calling people going, it's a terror attack.
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:36.120]  Another plane slams in right after that.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:37.120]  And I'm running around.
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:38.120]  I'm going, this is the attack.
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:39.120]  This is Northwoods.
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:40.960]  I get everybody ready.
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:42.560]  You know, they may try something any time.
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:46.200]  I think a bio attack is going to follow this in the next month, which by the way, the ADL
[02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:49.560]  then attacked me and said I was crazy, saying the government would probably launch an anthrax
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:50.560]  attack.
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:55.960]  I didn't think the ADL for ever enshrining that prediction I made on the radio.
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:57.360]  I just know how they work, folks.
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:59.520]  My head is in the game.
[02:17:59.520 --> 02:18:02.280]  And then I did solid Genesis broadcasting.
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:03.440]  I was on Derry Brownfield.
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:04.440]  I was on David Joyce.
[02:18:04.440 --> 02:18:05.440]  I was on Derry Brownfield.
[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:07.000]  I did three hours of my own show.
[02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:09.440]  I did Michael Trudeau's show next.
[02:18:09.440 --> 02:18:13.320]  And I broadcast right up until midnight that night, because I was doing two shows a day
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:16.720]  then, completely nuts, six hours a day on the Genesis network.
[02:18:16.720 --> 02:18:21.160]  Now we did a rebroadcast nine to midnight.
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:26.080]  But my girlfriend said, hey, why don't you go out and get some food at the grocery store
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:29.760]  and I'll sit here and answer the phone at that time, my office, out of my house.
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:30.760]  So I jetted over.
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:33.080]  I don't know why I'm telling this story.
[02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:37.640]  The point is, I'm driving in the car and I'm flipping between news stations.
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:39.440]  It's continual coverage.
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:42.960]  And I don't know if it was CBS or whether it was ABC.
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:44.040]  Memory fails.
[02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:46.480]  But they announced it was like 430.
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:50.680]  Well building seven could damage other buildings and so they may demolish it.
[02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:51.760]  They may bring it down.
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:55.560]  They're saying they may bring it down.
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:58.400]  And I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks.
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:03.000]  And then I started covering building seven, the first to really focus on it.
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.120]  But there it was.
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:08.120]  And then I went to New York in 2004 and these cops are walking up and emergency workers
[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:09.120]  are walking up.
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:12.880]  They're in martial law and they're going, yeah, they told us to get back from the building.
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:14.520]  It's going to be brought down.
[02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:17.080]  And then now we found all the firefighter and police tapes folks.
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:19.160]  We've got them on this.
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:20.160]  We've got them.
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.160]  We've got them.
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:23.800]  We've got them.
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:30.080]  I looked it up for over a month because in the first hour I said, when they blew up the
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:33.200]  Intel building yesterday here in Austin, it took weeks to set it up.
[02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:34.880]  I just said that.
[02:19:34.880 --> 02:19:36.600]  I knew it took at least two weeks.
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:37.600]  We went and looked it up.
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:39.440]  It was in the paper.
[02:19:39.440 --> 02:19:43.640]  More than a month ago, they began drilling the columns and getting ready to plant the
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:44.720]  bombs.
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:48.640]  They wrote up the plans a year ago to demolish it.
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:53.360]  So over a year of planning and over a month to rig it and the building didn't completely
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:54.360]  fall.
[02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:56.160]  And they said, that's no big deal.
[02:19:56.160 --> 02:19:57.160]  This happens quite often.
[02:19:57.160 --> 02:19:59.520]  We'll just blow up the other parts.
[02:19:59.520 --> 02:20:00.520]  Absolutely true.
[02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:04.360]  I should have been there yesterday, but I was getting ready for my Sunday show.
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:05.360]  I do.
[02:20:05.360 --> 02:20:08.280]  I literally am like a dog in a butcher shop folks.
[02:20:08.280 --> 02:20:09.560]  It's just, there's so much evidence.
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:11.440]  I don't know which to bite into.
[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:14.320]  So thank you, caller, for the heads up on that.
[02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:16.640]  We are going to blast it out big time.
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:19.000]  Everybody, this will be up in prison plan in the next hour.
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:20.000]  Get it.
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:21.000]  Get it out to everyone now.
[02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:23.040]  We're going to play the clip coming up.
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:29.760]  We'll continue with your calls and get to all the other clips as we defeat the terrorists.

[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:33.040]  Hello Ted Anderson, listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:35.440]  and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:39.720]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:43.360]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:47.720]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve
[02:21:47.720 --> 02:21:49.360]  for immediate withdrawal.
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:53.360]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:56.200]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:21:56.200 --> 02:22:00.760]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity
[02:22:00.760 --> 02:22:01.760]  for depositors.
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:06.040]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:07.040]  inflation.
[02:22:07.040 --> 02:22:11.240]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:15.000]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.680]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value
[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:21.480]  for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:21.480 --> 02:22:29.040]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237 that's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:32.160]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:35.960]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:39.480]  Ronald Reagan administration called REX 84?
[02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:43.960]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deans and enemy
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:44.960]  of the state.
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:49.640]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a
[02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:54.360]  program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it so he declared
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:58.000]  it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:01.600]  You would like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering

[02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:41.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, as we spoke, Google jerked the video, but info warriors reloaded
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:42.080]  it.
[02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:47.400]  We're grabbing the clip now as they fight to pull it down and stop us from exposing
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:48.400]  the murderers.
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:53.480]  We're never going to stop you killers, you murderers.
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:57.360]  We're going to expose you for Oklahoma City, we're going to expose you for 9-11, we're
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:00.280]  going to expose you for everything.
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:05.520]  Jason Burmese of Loose Change calling in, he got the clip this morning, they had jerked
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.800]  it, it's back up again, he's seen it, describe this to people.
[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:15.280]  This is from the unedited live archive, seven minutes into the clip, and we're trying to
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:19.720]  grab it right now, folks, we have to do this in real time, seven minutes into the clip,
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:24.360]  they talk about how Building 7 has been brought down, been demolished, and then Burmese is
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:28.400]  thinking, well, they've just got a time issue, maybe they've got their time zones off, because
[02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:33.120]  it really happened at 5.20, not 4.20, but no, they got their script off, then they
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:36.880]  cut to the reporter live, and there she is with the building smoking behind her.
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:40.360]  Burmese, tell us, you've seen the video, what does it show?
[02:25:40.360 --> 02:25:44.640]  It basically, it does what you just said, at like 4.57, it goes to a news report, at
[02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:50.240]  a desk, at the BBC world, and it basically says Building 7 has fallen due to fire, and
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:51.240]  I don't know what I said.
[02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:53.240]  Now wait a minute, you said seven minutes in, is it four or is it seven, because we're
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:54.240]  grabbing it?
[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:58.400]  Well, I'm on the website right now, actually, and it won't load for me, so I can't tell,
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:04.480]  but it is, if you type in World Trade Center 7, 23 minute warning, it's up there.
[02:26:04.480 --> 02:26:07.080]  And like you said, I thought it was just a time error.
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.880]  Well then they go to New York City, and the woman reporting, you can kind of see Building
[02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:15.000]  7 in the background, but you're like, there's no way, it's too good to be true, it can't
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.600]  be, it's still 15 minutes till the building collapses, and then all of a sudden they focus
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:24.560]  in on New York City, and it's clear as day, for over two minutes, that World Trade Center
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:31.200]  Building 7 is still standing, and that somehow this got on the APY or beforehand.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:36.440]  This is incredible, well that's the script, it's like when Powell, days before they attacked
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:43.200]  Iraq, he goes before the Senate, and he says, it's on Al Jazeera right now, Bin Laden says
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:47.360]  he works with Saddam, which of course wasn't true, and everybody ran out of the room and
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:50.240]  they came back and said Al Jazeera doesn't have that, and he said, well they will later
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:51.240]  today.
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:54.120]  Again, they get their times off.
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:56.680]  And I'm here right now, it looks like they're pulling it, Alex.
[02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:59.920]  It had 1,087 views, and right now it is down.
[02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:05.480]  Okay, so they pulled one, and then another one went up, and then they pulled that.
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:07.440]  What about the original BBC archive?
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:11.080]  Well, what we're doing right now is getting the raw video, and hopefully by tonight it's
[02:27:11.080 --> 02:27:15.040]  a large file, it's over a gig, we're going to YouTube it, and we're going to post it
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:16.040]  everywhere we can.
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:18.720]  We'll be MV it, we're going to get it out to people, and we're going to make it so
[02:27:18.720 --> 02:27:19.720]  good.
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:20.720]  We are too.
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:21.720]  Where is it on the BBC site?
[02:27:21.720 --> 02:27:22.720]  I guess it's live footage from the day.
[02:27:22.720 --> 02:27:23.720]  What section?
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:27.800]  I think it's actually archive.org, but I have to ask Dylan, we're going to actually be
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:31.560]  hosting Deadline Live after your show today, so we'll have complete updates on this and
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:35.160]  where people can get it, because they're not going to be able to censor this, Alex.
[02:27:35.160 --> 02:27:37.520]  Okay, we've got it queued up.
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:39.760]  Where do you have it queued to, John?
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:45.960]  Okay, but then we need the second clip, how many minutes after the first clip did they
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:48.760]  then go to the reporter?
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:52.280]  It's about a two or three minute news clip, and then finally they go to New York City,
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:58.920]  so it's in between him reporting it at 4.57 and around 5.05.
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:03.320]  Before they jerked it for the second time, again, operatives battling us in real time
[02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:08.640]  right now, ladies and gentlemen, continual coverage, John, were you able to get the second
[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:11.080]  part of the clip?
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:16.240]  Okay, check the other machine, wasn't able to get it.
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:19.240]  It is so, thank God we got the download.
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:20.240]  Yes.
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:21.240]  Awesome.
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:22.240]  Aha!
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:23.960]  Man, I tell you, I just love the battle.
[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:24.960]  What about you?
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:30.360]  I am digging it, Alex, and this is just another example about it in New York City.
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:34.280]  They're going to prison, they're not going to stop the Republic.
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:37.920]  That's right, and you know, as long as we keep confronting people like Obama Barak and
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:42.120]  great guerrilla tactics from Project for a New American Citizen and others, we're going
[02:28:42.120 --> 02:28:46.600]  to take these guys down, we're going to make 9-11 Truth the issue of 2008.
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:50.880]  If it comes out fully, the new order will fall.
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:51.880]  Absolutely.
[02:28:51.880 --> 02:28:56.200]  Oh my gosh, I tell you.
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:59.600]  So you've gotten four minutes in, are you still recording to get the next part so we
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:01.840]  can play that after the break, John?
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:04.920]  Okay, we should have this after the break.
[02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:10.200]  You know what, I'll definitely chime in and pop in during deadline with you guys as we
[02:29:10.200 --> 02:29:15.360]  continue to analyze this, Jason, and we really appreciate the fine work you've been doing.
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:18.040]  Alright, thanks so much, Alex, and I can't wait to hear from you there.
[02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:19.040]  You bet.
[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:20.040]  Tell folks about your Saturday transmission.
[02:29:20.040 --> 02:29:25.600]  Oh, yeah, that's on GCN from 9-11 Central Times, Saturday mornings, me and Dylan, Loud
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:26.600]  of the Words Radio.
[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:28.960]  Alright, thank you so much.
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:29.960]  Thank you.
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:34.880]  Oh man, I tell you, this is just, I meant to get into Iraq and I ran Attack News.
[02:29:34.880 --> 02:29:39.720]  And we're going to try to do that as well, but I know we had loaded phone lines and I
[02:29:39.720 --> 02:29:43.880]  want to get to all your calls, but again, this show is so fluid.
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:46.040]  We got the unsealed federal documents.
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:51.040]  They were completely sealed concerning the FBI being involved in orchestrating the bombings.
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:53.200]  We have all that that we can break.
[02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:55.520]  I covered it over the weekend on Sunday.
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:56.520]  New developments there.
[02:29:56.520 --> 02:29:59.240]  We've got Jesse trying to do the lawyer coming back on soon.
[02:29:59.240 --> 02:30:00.760]  We've got come dead in rights there.
[02:30:00.760 --> 02:30:01.760]  We've got this.
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:04.840]  It's just, it's just so much is happening.
[02:30:04.840 --> 02:30:06.640]  And this is a war room.
[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:10.920]  And these are the issues we're focused on, and that's why we're having an effect.
[02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:14.360]  And I just want to say that John Harmon's doing a great job there at the network, like
[02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:19.800]  an octopus doing 10 different jobs, who'll be right back on the other side.
[02:30:19.800 --> 02:30:21.080]  We're on the march.
[02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:23.520]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:27.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:30.840]  Shall I, you look ex-
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:32.640]  Oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:35.520]  Well, I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:38.400]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that's squeaky voice.
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:39.880]  Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:42.640]  What's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night?
[02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:44.120]  I could do something like that.
[02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:47.840]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night, and you know how I am about doing
[02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:49.400]  that hormone therapy thing.
[02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:51.200]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:53.680]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:30:53.680 --> 02:30:54.680]  I guess you're right.
[02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:55.960]  Why don't we try it?
[02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:58.000]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:01.680]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer, and all the money we can save on
[02:31:01.680 --> 02:31:02.680]  air conditioning.
[02:31:02.680 --> 02:31:04.760]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:08.080]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a
[02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:09.080]  good night's sleep.

[02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:30.920]  What is the secret of the sea?
[02:32:30.920 --> 02:32:35.920]  It's the exciting food from the sea and it can be yours with nature's original superfood
[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:36.920]  from walkers.

[02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:43.880]  minerals and vitamins.

[02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:54.560]  You would need almost 20 pounds of alfalfa, 10 pounds of spirulina and 40 pounds of wheat
[02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:59.760]  to get the same nutritional value found in only one pound of walkers exclusive blend
[02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:00.760]  of sea plants.

[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:42.120]  Alright, enemy forces pulled it earlier, real time they pulled it again on us but not before
[02:33:42.120 --> 02:33:45.800]  our computers had seized it.
[02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:49.840]  Whoever uploaded it needs to continue uploading, we're now getting reports that the BBC site
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:51.680]  itself is taking it down.
[02:33:51.680 --> 02:33:57.560]  If this is an evidence of ongoing cover up, I don't know what is, just like Terry Nichols
[02:33:57.560 --> 02:34:02.000]  tries to reach out to Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2004 from his maximum security
[02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.720]  prison in Colorado and then all media being able to visit with Nichols is suddenly terminated
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:16.600]  under an order, then the feds instantly seal the filing but literally a day after.
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:21.920]  This is unbelievable, it's the same MO over and over again, we now have the clips for
[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:22.920]  you.
[02:34:22.920 --> 02:34:26.800]  I hope they don't cut our satellites off, they've done this once or twice before when
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.480]  something's this big but you're not going to stop us murderers.
[02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:38.800]  This is 440N from live BBC archive of the day, 440N to this clip, they're talking about
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:45.960]  Building 7 has collapsed and we fast forward to roughly 1520 as they cut to her, the BBC
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:51.400]  reporter talking about how Building 7 has collapsed and right behind her there is Building
[02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:56.280]  7 smoking, unbelievable, they're reporting on this.
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:02.560]  An hour before, excuse me, about 25 minutes before it truly did collapse, getting off
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:06.560]  in their scripting, exactly what I heard that day and it's going to come out.
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:09.320]  We're going to end up finding the ABC News piece where they said that oh there's been
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:13.000]  an order to blow it up, it's just all going to start coming out because people now with
[02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.040]  the web are scanning everything.
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:20.280]  We are a private organic intelligence operation against the New World Order, millions of you
[02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:27.160]  out there crawling all over everything, get out there, find it, bring it to us, oh we're
[02:35:27.160 --> 02:35:31.480]  going to expose these murderers, I'm just getting so excited here because I've committed
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:35.560]  my life to this, I've risked my life in this, I want to bring these killers to justice,
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:37.880]  we will bring them to justice.
[02:35:37.880 --> 02:35:42.240]  440 BBC live from that day, here it is.
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:47.880]  Well, you and I might think that but some people don't look at the world in that way,
[02:35:47.880 --> 02:35:52.760]  if people say the only thing that works is force, that works in both directions.
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:58.920]  We'll leave it there for the moment, we've got some news just coming in actually that
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:05.720]  the Salomon Brothers building in New York, right in the heart of Manhattan, has also
[02:36:05.720 --> 02:36:07.760]  collapsed.
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:13.040]  This does fit in with a warning from the British Foreign Office a couple of hours ago to British
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:20.320]  citizens that there is a real risk, let me get the exact words, the British Foreign Office,
[02:36:20.320 --> 02:36:25.240]  the Foreign Department of the British Government said there was a strong risk of further atrocities
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:31.400]  in the United States and it does seem as if there now is another one with the Salomon
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:38.240]  Brothers building collapsing, we've got no word yet on casualties, one assumes that the
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:41.240]  building would have been virtually deserted.
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:46.680]  One of this latest collapse is going to influence the President who we heard about a few moments
[02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:54.240]  ago, was expected to be heading from Nebraska back to Washington, we don't know.
[02:36:54.240 --> 02:37:00.760]  Dan Klesch, what do you think this is going to do to that crucial equation between on
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.640]  the one hand freedom and on the other hand security, the balance is going to change I
[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:09.440]  would have guessed radically in the United States after this.
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:15.240]  Americans pride themselves on their freedom but I think we will see a real crackdown on
[02:37:15.240 --> 02:37:22.000]  the security front particularly for access and travelling around in America on domestic
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:26.200]  airlines which notoriously have been very, very open.
[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:31.160]  What will this do to the American psyche, you know them well, you've lived there.
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:37.800]  I think the idea that Americans will just retreat into themselves is nonsense, that
[02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:43.320]  was the Japanese hope when they attacked Pearl Harbor but of course the Americans responded
[02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:45.200]  massively to that.
[02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:50.960]  America I think will engage the world, we have to see whether they do it strongly.
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:57.640]  Dan Klesch for the moment, thank you.
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:01.240]  Okay does it continue or should we continue John?
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:05.080]  Let's go to the next, this is 15 and let's back it up a little bit where he introduces
[02:38:05.080 --> 02:38:06.080]  her.
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:09.200]  He's on the scene, John's up there, he just saw it, I haven't even seen the show.
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:13.520]  John's seen it, John Harmon at the network, Jason Bermas has seen it, Paul Watson has
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:15.920]  seen it all confirming that this happens.
[02:38:15.920 --> 02:38:21.040]  It shows them saying the building's collapsed then it for two minutes zooms in on the building,
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:22.760]  nothing's collapsed.
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:29.600]  This is, it is building seven with that brick red colour in the black windows, the big spook
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.760]  base that they blew up, now again we have all the firefighters, the police, the witnesses
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:40.320]  but here's the news announcing early it collapsed because of the script, you got off script
[02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:41.320]  didn't you?
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:43.200]  Here it is.
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:47.600]  Now more on the latest building collapse in New York, you might have heard a few moments
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:52.600]  ago it was talking about the Salomon Brothers building collapsing and indeed it has, apparently
[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:57.840]  that's only a few hundred yards away from where the World Trade Center towers were and
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:02.480]  it seems that this was not a result of a new attack, it was because the building had been
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:07.720]  weakened during this morning's attacks, we'll probably find out more now about that from
[02:39:07.720 --> 02:39:09.640]  our correspondent, Jane Stanley.
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:14.280]  Jane what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:20.360]  Well, only really what you already know details are very very sketchy, there's almost a sense
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:26.920]  down town in New York behind me down by the World Trade Centers of just an area completely
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:32.440]  closed off as the rescue workers try to do their job but this isn't the first building
[02:39:32.440 --> 02:39:38.480]  that has suffered as a result, we know that part of the Marriott Hotel next to the World
[02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:45.520]  Trade Center also collapsed as a result of this huge amount of falling debris from 110
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:49.360]  floors of the two Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:54.520]  As you can see behind me the Trade Center appears to be still burning, we see these
[02:39:54.520 --> 02:40:01.360]  huge clouds of smoke and ash and we know that behind that there's an empty piece of what
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:09.160]  was a very familiar New York skyline, a symbol of the financial prosperity of this city but
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:15.320]  completely disappeared now and New York is still unable to take on board what has happened
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:16.720]  to them today.
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:21.120]  Presumably there were very few people in the Salomon building when it collapsed, I mean
[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:26.280]  there were I suppose fears of possible further collapses around the area.
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:31.840]  That's what you would hope because this whole downtown area behind me has been completely
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:38.680]  sealed off and evacuated apart from the emergency workers, that was done by the Mayor Rudy Giuliani
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:43.720]  much earlier today because of the course the dreadful collapse of the Twin Towers of the
[02:40:43.720 --> 02:40:49.760]  World Trade Center but New York very much a city still in chaos, the phones are not
[02:40:49.760 --> 02:40:54.480]  working properly, the subway lines are not working properly and we know that down there
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:41:00.000]  near the World Trade Center there are three schools that are being turned into triage
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:05.720]  centers for emergency treatment and I know that over in New York Harbour where the famous
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:11.240]  statue of liberty is there's a field hospital where 1500 people are being treated and we
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:17.160]  have heard though it's unconfirmed as yet that a hundred New York City police officers
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:22.720]  have been taken there as well for treatment but we do need to confirm those figures for
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:23.720]  the officers.
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:28.000]  When it goes on keep listening John will play more there's more important areas.
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:34.320]  Now again the video is John let's just bring you up you've seen the video I don't allow
[02:41:34.320 --> 02:41:38.280]  myself to have a computer here in studio because it becomes a distraction I print stuff off
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:43.000]  it's in the other rooms they've seen it you've seen it Watson's seen it Burmese has seen
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:48.080]  it but it goes along with the descriptions you've seen the video again they've jerked
[02:41:48.080 --> 02:41:52.960]  it again that's twice they're moving quickly this is unprecedented we're told they've
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:59.160]  jerked it off the BBC site that is the source of this we'll see if it's on archive.org
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:04.080]  or they've been able to pull that I want everybody in my staff scrambling get it secure it here's
[02:42:04.080 --> 02:42:12.560]  the problem here's the problem we would put out clips of my films for free in the past
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:17.000]  and we would find places like archive.org and put them out because we couldn't pay for
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:20.200]  the bandwidth I've tried to put a film out for free on the web before even a 10 minute
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:25.400]  clip that time that bribery at the capital and they were paying people off to give testimony
[02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:29.840]  against the second amendment we caught video of it hundreds of thousands watched it I got
[02:42:29.840 --> 02:42:34.320]  some like nine thousand dollar bill this was like seven eight years ago and I had to take
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:39.760]  it down so thanks to YouTube Google and some of the other places we've been able because
[02:42:39.760 --> 02:42:43.880]  they've got the bandwidth to have millions of people watch our films hundreds of thousands
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:50.600]  watch the clips I have just secured more servers I've got a lot of bandwidth now and in fact
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:53.840]  I'm about to do something in the next few months that's going to cost a lot of money
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:57.560]  but I'm going to the great a bandwidth most people don't even know it exists at that
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:43:03.240]  level it's like 10% the cost of everybody else pays but you got to buy masses of it
[02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:07.960]  we will post this if we're able to it may crash the sites I don't know what we're going
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:13.960]  to do but that way they can't pull it will love and we'll just have them come after us
[02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:18.360]  I don't care we will expose the crimes but John turn your microphone off kick anybody
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:23.080]  out of studio it's noisy in there John Harmon that runs the show a real hero does such a
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:27.880]  good job the show's gotten so much better since I've had him doing things the last few years
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:35.240]  John you've seen the video describe what you see well there's a BBC female reporter and
[02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:39.760]  basically she's talking about how building seven collapse and the towers collapse but
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:45.200]  actually you can see right behind her building sevens still standing and that was what twenty
[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:49.680]  five minutes before it actually did collapse yes and the clock you know they start reporting
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:53.560]  this thirty something minutes and by the time she's up there it's what twenty four twenty
[02:43:53.560 --> 02:43:59.720]  five minutes till it collapses nothing's collapsed there's smoking building seven and it's just
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:03.720]  amazing I wonder how they're going to try to spend this so so so that's how it's been
[02:44:03.720 --> 02:44:08.200]  described to me by you and everybody else describe exactly what you see Burma said for
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:12.880]  like two minutes while she's talking they zoom past her shoulder in on the building seven
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:17.080]  yeah they zoom right in on it she's talking about how they all collapsed and you can see
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:22.840]  it clears day and they someone whoever made the video actually pointed in an arrow saying
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:27.480]  oops it's still there someone messed up I try this is the copy that somebody grabbed
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:31.640]  with the BBC and then added this to we need to get the raw original that I'm told is at
[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:36.240]  the BBC website I'm told it may be pulled down or an archive dot org we've got to go
[02:44:36.240 --> 02:44:42.240]  absolutely ape and everybody's got to grab this immediately John what is it like doing
[02:44:42.240 --> 02:44:46.560]  this job seeing these clips here in the video I mean I mean seeing the clips you know hearing
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:50.960]  the audio from these videos knowing it yeah I mean you live in the middle of this what's
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:57.320]  it been like working here for you well this is just another day in the jungle and it's
[02:44:57.320 --> 02:45:03.320]  definitely I'm totally convinced and I mean day after day we place clips about you know
[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:10.240]  firefighters and eyewitnesses and I mean this is video evidence I mean there's no if fans
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:14.640]  or bucks you can't debate that well everybody I talked to me literally hundreds in New York
[02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:19.120]  go oh yeah they were on NPR and they were on ABC said they were going to bring down building
[02:45:19.120 --> 02:45:23.400]  seven for everybody safety and then they blew it up and Silverstein slipped up and said they
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:29.480]  pulled it and people try to spin that I heard it in my car that afternoon and I was listening
[02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:34.120]  to W.O.A.I. and K.O.B.J. back and forth I think it was ABC on K.O.B.J. they down carry
[02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:40.200]  Fox I can't remember though the point is now we have all this video all this audio and
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:45.480]  now we have this where they're showing that it's 20 something minutes before the collapse
[02:45:45.480 --> 02:45:49.760]  and they're and it shows how they follow the script how mindless these reporters are there
[02:45:49.760 --> 02:45:54.760]  is in that it's the Solomon Brothers building folks it's just designated number seven in
[02:45:54.760 --> 02:45:59.480]  the complex we call it seven it's its proper name was the Solomon Brothers building and
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:03.280]  we have the maps of it in the tenants and who was in it and there they are zooming in
[02:46:03.280 --> 02:46:08.080]  on it saying this how are they going to spend this John they cannot I mean they did that
[02:46:08.080 --> 02:46:12.880]  with the uh... bullet clip with Larry Silverstein saying oh they're gonna pull the firefighters
[02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:17.320]  out but the firefighters have never been there that day exactly there everyone was already
[02:46:17.320 --> 02:46:22.680]  evacuated and so you know exactly well then the same documentary they cut to them months
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:28.360]  later demolishing six and they go get ready to ball bail in six yep and then they define
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:34.440]  what pull it means it's a demolition term I haven't seen it but I've got a call by one
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:38.600]  of my friends he said on one of the local newscast they said getting ready to pull it that's
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:43.280]  the term pulling in ten seconds maybe they'll tell them not to use that term now what to
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:48.440]  change the meaning of it well I mean how are they gonna spend this and you know it's gonna
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:52.360]  start coming out I can't wait to hear that NPR that literally hundreds of New Yorkers
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:56.920]  told me about I can't wait to hear all this I can't wait we've got to go dig it out I've
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:01.760]  tried to get it from NPR New York and they say they're not releasing it I mean how do
[02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:06.920]  these people work in these jobs knowing the government did this how do you as reporters
[02:47:06.920 --> 02:47:14.760]  go along regurgitating the lie John let's play some of those clips again to back this
[02:47:14.760 --> 02:47:18.080]  up let's play the CNN where the two cops are saying get back building sevens coming down
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:23.280]  they're gonna bring it down it's gonna blow up and then let's play silver screen saying
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:29.240]  pull it and then let's play the firefighters talking about the molten steel just just play
[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:33.120]  the clips whenever order you want it doesn't even matter do you have the CNN one we need
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:37.280]  to pull these in one file yep I need a fight no I sent you like 40 something more the other
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:41.600]  weekend I don't know what you've done with those but that's another thing now we found
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:52.200]  like it's more than 70 clips total we have now and I found 44 news articles AP Reuters
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:57.200]  with firefighters saying yeah we pulled building seven we got I'm not just we were told to
[02:47:57.200 --> 02:48:02.120]  demolish it I mean I'm just wallowing in this evidence I don't even know what the what the
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:07.880]  point is anymore but it's like when Perry comes out and says it's the law you've got to take
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:11.960]  vaccines and I say he's on the Merck payroll and it's in the Associated Press people email
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:18.000]  me going you're a liar he hasn't been lobbied by Merck I mean how far does your denial stretch
[02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:26.120]  out there do you have the next clip molten steel here it is you get down below and you
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:32.200]  see molten steel molten steel running down the channel rails like you're in a foundry
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:38.760]  like a lot of people like a lot of them okay I'm screaming there wasn't a lot of yelling
[02:48:38.760 --> 02:48:42.520]  okay so there's New York firefighters New York TV saying molten steel like lava like
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:48.640]  a foundry impossible jet fuel can't even melt steel okay what about the CNN clip with the
[02:48:48.640 --> 02:48:51.560]  cops are saying get back they're gonna pull it it's gonna come down it's gonna be brought
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:49:21.400]  down it's gonna blow up yeah here's Silverstein okay we're able to find the CNN
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:27.040]  you know it's you know the CNN one where they're saying get back get back it's gonna fall they're
[02:49:27.040 --> 02:49:33.400]  gonna bring it down you know that clip with the cops running in front of seven I know
[02:49:33.400 --> 02:49:40.880]  here on the here on the go that's the problem going through all these clips again the evidence
[02:49:40.880 --> 02:49:47.920]  shows the BBC archive of a live broadcast that day 30 minutes plus before they start announcing
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:56.000]  that building sevens fallen then 20 plus minutes it says says well they've got all the clock
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:01.400]  numbers go back give me those clock numbers again they say that it's gonna collapse oh
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:06.360]  no they say it has collapsed and then they cut to hers talking about how it collapsed
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:30.880]  and there it is smoking behind her for two minutes CNN's ready here it is
[02:50:30.880 --> 02:50:35.080]  just in the last few seconds another building building number seven one of the building
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:39.120]  okay so the cops are saying it's about to be brought down it's about to blow up it's
[02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:44.280]  about to fall and I've talked to the cops the police they're on record there is a countdown
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:51:00.840]  there was a 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 pull boom goes down and it takes weeks to plant bombs
[02:51:00.840 --> 02:51:09.560]  they didn't do it that day they did it beforehand 9 11's an inside job 9 11's an inside job
[02:51:09.560 --> 02:51:17.280]  9 11 is an inside job 9 11 is an inside job how dumb are all the servants of the system
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:21.280]  gonna feel who weren't even on the payroll but you've lied for the system you've lied
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:27.440]  to yourselves about it it's all going to come out God has promised that every lie will be
[02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:36.840]  exposed it's here after a year in production traveling to distant lands my new film terror
[02:51:36.840 --> 02:51:41.480]  storm is complete shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:46.560]  orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them

[02:54:59.800 --> 02:55:04.720]  you the listeners out there analyzing the clips going through the archives finding this material
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:09.520]  the globalist play the old game where they could kill presidents and stage attacks and
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:16.520]  fund dictators in the dark now they're being exposed and I think it's poetic justice the
[02:55:16.520 --> 02:55:22.960]  BBC would construct that nauseatingly juvenile hit piece against us two weeks ago that this
[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:30.280]  come out of their own mouths they're gonna have a lot of trouble spinning this because
[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:35.840]  why is it important it shows that they put out this was on the AP wire we've now learned
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:40.840]  that they had pulled it they got it early that because when you script stuff you're
[02:55:40.840 --> 02:55:45.920]  gonna have screw ups no modern steel building had ever fallen one and two had fallen seven
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:50.920]  had small fires in it not hit by a plane and they told everybody get back we're going to
[02:55:50.920 --> 02:55:55.920]  pull it we're going to blow it up we're going to bring it down we've got all these witnesses
[02:55:55.920 --> 02:56:03.200]  now we have BBC sitting there scripting it go and screwing up the script and they're
[02:56:03.200 --> 02:56:08.040]  so brain dead there's building seven behind her they zoom right in on it hasn't collapsed
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:12.760]  and twenty something minutes before she collapses she's saying and we've got the news anchors
[02:56:12.760 --> 02:56:19.800]  back at the BBC thirty something minutes before it collapses saying it's collapsed there's
[02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:23.960]  another clip of it up on Google right now people are uploading it everybody needs to
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:28.440]  go upload it under other names you know how to upload out there go grab it yourself start
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:32.840]  uploading it at different places put it on YouTube put it on hundreds of different areas
[02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:39.480]  under hundreds of different names and that's how we're going to beat them because they've
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:43.240]  got people in there right now I mean normally you put up some clip they don't want to take
[02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:48.600]  some weeks to get it down this is boom boom boom this is high level takedowns which is
[02:56:48.600 --> 02:56:53.680]  just more evidence of how they're scrambling to stop this information from getting out
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:59.880]  you cannot let it get out they will be a detailed report next hour on prisonplanet.com it will
[02:56:59.880 --> 02:57:04.880]  be mirrored on all the sites we are getting this up this is vitally important and help

[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:14.440]  other links to previous stories and video clips and documents get the basic blurb up
[02:57:14.440 --> 02:57:19.320]  there five six paragraphs then under it put the archive on building seven in there so
[02:57:19.320 --> 02:57:23.520]  people just can't see this one piece of evidence and try to engage in double think because
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:27.400]  the average person has been brainwashed to just use their brain to get around things
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:34.240]  and rationalize and make excuses they blew building seven up in front of everybody people
[02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:37.960]  say well folks would talk cops and firemen are on record going yeah they said they were
[02:57:37.960 --> 02:57:42.160]  going to blow it up they come on the radio we play the clips we interview them people
