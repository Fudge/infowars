[00:00.000 --> 00:10.960]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[00:10.960 --> 00:18.680]  does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:18.680 --> 00:32.200]  Alex Jones it's one thing to know what the globalists are planning more than a
[00:32.200 --> 00:40.000]  decade out it's another thing to live to see it unfolding I marvel and I know
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.240]  many of you are marveling as well ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday the
[00:44.240 --> 00:50.360]  final day of July 2013 and we're going to be here for the next three hours
[00:50.360 --> 00:57.320]  broadcasting worldwide Steve Jolly who I had a chance to meet out in the UK is
[00:57.320 --> 01:03.680]  known as the CCTV man and he wears big CCTV cameras on his head paper mache
[01:03.680 --> 01:10.520]  and he is single-handedly caused a national debate about it and had federal
[01:10.520 --> 01:15.600]  and local courts rule recently that indeed especially the license plate
[01:15.600 --> 01:22.560]  reading cameras are a Big Brother invasive unconstitutional system in
[01:22.560 --> 01:28.400]  the United Kingdom the most surveilled Big Brother society on the planet
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.160]  Terra firma today he'll be popping in for 30 minutes at the start of the next
[01:33.160 --> 01:37.600]  hour and then of course Leanne McAdoo is going to be coming on the broadcast
[01:37.600 --> 01:43.640]  dealing with the real depths of child and an underage sex slave trafficking
[01:43.640 --> 01:51.280]  because we've seen in the last few days big news articles out dealing with
[01:51.280 --> 01:58.440]  sweeps that have been done across the country with these underage prostitutes
[01:58.440 --> 02:04.480]  some as young as 12 years old and the FBI and others have gone and arrested 150
[02:04.480 --> 02:08.800]  plus disgusting degenerate pimps need to have their brains blown out but of
[02:08.800 --> 02:12.760]  course that won't happen they'll be let out of jail quickly hope somebody beats
[02:12.760 --> 02:16.960]  their brains out in prison but the whole point is I'm sorry I have to control
[02:16.960 --> 02:21.280]  myself the point is I wish they would get the death penalty is that it's much
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.440]  worse than that and most the government is against this type of stuff but they're
[02:25.440 --> 02:30.360]  compartmentalized there are groups at the top involved this has come out before in
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.360]  the really bad stuff of little children including snuff films and I saw an
[02:35.360 --> 02:38.520]  article today if I should add that to the stack we're home or homeland security
[02:38.520 --> 02:46.600]  high-level director deputy director was caught passing along sadomasochistic
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.000]  torture of small children this is exactly the top of stuff the new
[02:51.000 --> 02:55.840]  orders into so we're going to be looking at that at the start of the third
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.000]  hour today for a couple segments and then David Knight who's been really
[03:00.000 --> 03:07.160]  helping me honcho kind of try to process the 600 plus entries to the

[08:35.920 --> 08:39.960]  the surveillance cameras reading license plates Steve jolly will be joining us at

[08:44.200 --> 08:51.040]  britainia then leon macadoo will join us to expose the whitewash that the federal
[08:51.040 --> 08:55.760]  government's trying to stop the trafficking in women and children as sex
[08:55.760 --> 09:00.520]  slaves so we're going to be breaking that down as well and david night will
[09:00.520 --> 09:05.440]  pop in in the last 30 minutes of this worldwide transmission today to announce
[09:05.440 --> 09:12.280]  the $100,000 winner that i have chosen and most of my crew concurred that it
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.840]  was in the second or first place i'll tell you right now that the maker of
[09:17.840 --> 09:24.720]  american drone who won second place $10,000 prize probably would have beaten
[09:24.720 --> 09:29.000]  the first place winner that will be announced maybe 50-50 i'd probably have
[09:29.000 --> 09:33.920]  to flip a coin it's that close with his film the futurist that we've put up on
[09:33.920 --> 09:38.080]  my youtube channel that i suggest everyone see that we posted on info
[09:38.080 --> 09:43.200]  wars dot com yesterday it it's really powerful but i want to tell you a dream
[09:43.200 --> 09:46.920]  revered we want to talk to you soon and work with you as soon as obama
[09:46.920 --> 09:53.360]  deception too is done in october it's coming out early november we want to
[09:53.360 --> 10:00.160]  talk to really the top 10 that we're trying to select internally we're gonna
[10:00.160 --> 10:08.160]  try to talk to you to produce films with us so again it was very hard to pick
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.400]  whether it would be political earth or a dream revered and regardless though i
[10:14.400 --> 10:17.880]  just i start thinking about it we spent a lot of time i don't know we'll do
[10:17.880 --> 10:22.040]  another one of these contests though because getting 600 entries has been
[10:22.040 --> 10:26.560]  very successful it has bogged us down the last few months it is really and i
[10:26.560 --> 10:33.840]  knew it would be a monumental task but it has been it has been really intensive
[10:33.840 --> 10:39.600]  watching 600 videos here for the crew and honing them down to 300 and then
[10:39.600 --> 10:48.200]  200 and 150 and then 35 and the top 10 or so but that now is completed today and
[10:48.200 --> 10:51.320]  we pay everybody out the hundred fifteen thousand dollar in prizes and then we
[10:51.320 --> 10:57.000]  move on to the real game plan promoting all the films that hit every
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.520]  different angle you can imagine to wake people up and then trying to then work
[11:02.520 --> 11:07.680]  with us some of the filmmakers there and you know let's say maybe you were in the
[11:07.680 --> 11:11.920]  top hundred or so but you did good reporting well look for us maybe to
[11:11.920 --> 11:16.560]  try to hire you as a part-time auxiliary reporter i mean i'm just looking for the
[11:16.560 --> 11:21.440]  raw talent that's out there in humanity that's what my gut and my spirit and my
[11:21.440 --> 11:24.200]  intellect tells me to do and that's what i'm that's what i'm trying to do so
[11:24.200 --> 11:28.320]  that's coming up in the last 25 30 minutes of the transmission today that's
[11:28.320 --> 11:39.120]  said ladies and gentlemen i got up today and saw a daily caller article with the
[11:39.120 --> 11:49.560]  headline attention alex jones get ready for behavioral insight team and then
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.040]  they make a joke about me in here kind of but say oh it is what alex said was
[11:54.040 --> 12:00.320]  coming the conspiracy theorist look mainstream news fox news msnbc you name
[12:00.320 --> 12:05.200]  it are all reporting that they're going to hire trendies as front people with
[12:05.200 --> 12:09.920]  government funding for every niche group out there to push basically the
[12:09.920 --> 12:16.720]  surveillance state the tyranny now imagine i love how mainstream media posing
[12:16.720 --> 12:20.400]  as as libertarian media and they do some good work so i want to be too mean but
[12:20.400 --> 12:23.160]  they're always attacking me so i mean turnabouts fair play at some level
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.560]  about how they're telling me about it in fact i saw an article last week going
[12:27.560 --> 12:31.920]  oh look alex jones will want to see this they're launching blimps with face
[12:31.920 --> 12:38.360]  scanning cameras and ground penetrating radar over major cities to watch you they
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.240]  launched those back in the 1990s as a test and officially launched them in
[12:42.240 --> 12:48.040]  2002 i mean it's just ridiculous it's like i'm more discredited as
[12:48.040 --> 12:52.960]  everything i say comes true and they have to make jokes about all of it hey
[12:52.960 --> 12:57.400]  let me tell you something the jokes on you bud and me too if we don't do
[12:57.400 --> 13:00.320]  something about this because let me tell you something the other stuff i've been
[13:00.320 --> 13:06.080]  warning you about it's all true too there were mainstream news articles in the
[13:06.080 --> 13:11.440]  last week about yeah 98 million americans did get a deadly cancer virus put in
[13:11.440 --> 13:14.560]  them and that was in the first phase and then a couple hundred million more in the
[13:14.560 --> 13:20.080]  decades after that and yeah tens of millions probably died from it a sv40 but
[13:20.080 --> 13:24.920]  you know what so what let's move on to how scary al-qaeda is you got double the
[13:24.920 --> 13:28.720]  chance of honeybees killing each year but and the government runs them too but
[13:28.720 --> 13:32.360]  isn't it scary yeah we got to have them with black uniforms and armored vehicles
[13:32.360 --> 13:35.720]  and face scanning cameras and listen to all your phone calls because of them yeah
[13:35.720 --> 13:40.760]  right i mean you're not in Kansas anymore folks i'm talking to the
[13:40.760 --> 13:43.920]  establishment people that think they're they're gonna be on the winning team
[13:43.920 --> 13:48.920]  nobody's a winner in this deal every time people think they can cheat and bring
[13:48.920 --> 13:54.920]  an evil because they want to dominate everybody else in some you know hyper
[13:54.920 --> 14:02.000]  psychopathic dominance based mania some type of psychopathic narcissism
[14:02.000 --> 14:08.120]  hyper psychopathic control freakism coupled with a mass Stockholm syndrome
[14:08.120 --> 14:15.520]  overton window moved to hell i mean i don't know what to do here but they've
[14:15.520 --> 14:20.520]  got the social security administration the Pentagon the Department of Justice
[14:20.520 --> 14:25.600]  all the major media networks financial taxpayer money for a news core is too by
[14:25.600 --> 14:29.760]  the way they get federal money that's on record to push carbon taxes and crud in
[14:29.760 --> 14:33.600]  their entertainment shows not Fox News that's the niche to keep conservatives
[14:33.600 --> 14:38.280]  on a reservation but then you've got all the other anti-gun anti-family pro
[14:38.280 --> 14:44.680]  torture pro secret arrest anti-male role model pro carbon tax garbage on Fox TV
[14:44.680 --> 14:51.600]  and Fox movies and I've dealt with Fox Searchlight where they came to Richard
[14:51.600 --> 14:56.200]  Linklater and said we're not gonna we're not gonna distribute this as much this
[14:56.200 --> 15:01.360]  this Philip K. Dick movie Alex Jones is in yours truly produced with Tommy
[15:01.360 --> 15:11.440]  Pallotta if if you show that cop blowing somebody's brains out and Rick Linklater
[15:11.440 --> 15:14.160]  said i'm not gonna change it that's kind of stuff you never hear about he
[15:14.160 --> 15:16.960]  probably doesn't want that public they never told me not to tell anybody but i
[15:16.960 --> 15:21.920]  sat there hearing about this we're not gonna promote that movie if you do if you
[15:21.920 --> 15:25.560]  show and it was a bunch of other stuff they wanted cut and Rick Linklater said
[15:25.560 --> 15:31.160]  I'm not gonna do that and I'm gonna rush and get it done because if you do it late
[15:31.160 --> 15:35.360]  then they take the final cut control away I mean that's an honorable person
[15:35.360 --> 15:38.840]  right there ladies and gentlemen and they wanted some stuff I consulted on
[15:38.840 --> 15:42.360]  taken out of there I was I'm more proud of being a consultant on a scanner darkly
[15:42.360 --> 15:51.480]  that's got a bunch of big stars in it then I am being in it but I don't know
[15:51.480 --> 15:57.800]  ladies and gentlemen that's got Winona Ryder Woody Harrelson in it Robert
[15:57.800 --> 16:04.440]  Downey Jr. Keanu Reeves I'll tell you Winona Ryder is a very interesting
[16:04.440 --> 16:09.080]  person all right ladies and gentlemen so I've talked about that I've already
[16:09.080 --> 16:18.560]  dealt ladies and gentlemen I've already dealt with my whole media operation for
[16:18.560 --> 16:25.160]  18 years I've experienced the censorship the manipulation the people fighting
[16:25.160 --> 16:28.880]  back against it I know now most people in Hollywood just say I'll do whatever
[16:28.880 --> 16:34.360]  you say and they go well instead of you having a $10 million budget and basically
[16:34.360 --> 16:38.200]  all those stars being in the film for nothing I think they got paid like $30,000
[16:38.200 --> 16:40.880]  a piece or something because they wanted to be in it instead of 20 million a piece
[16:40.880 --> 16:47.040]  like I normally get or 10 million a piece I mean Robert Downey Jr. is what
[16:47.040 --> 16:50.520]  the highest-paid actor out there they give me like $500 million last year my
[16:50.520 --> 16:54.720]  whole point here is ladies and gentlemen that that's the type of control
[16:54.720 --> 16:58.480]  going on most people in Hollywood say we'll do whatever you say and they go
[16:58.480 --> 17:05.120]  $300 million budget Department of Defense is funding 100 mil boom 100 mil
[17:05.120 --> 17:10.840]  taxpayer BAM because if they've got the printing presses ladies and gentlemen
[17:10.840 --> 17:15.520]  and they're buying up all the talent they came to me 12 13 years ago 10 years
[17:15.520 --> 17:19.520]  ago seven years ago through media executives and said how'd you like 10
[17:19.520 --> 17:27.360]  million dollars a year you play ball with us you get it and that's what the
[17:27.360 --> 17:32.920]  general naive public doesn't get ladies and gentlemen they don't understand how

[24:29.560 --> 24:36.320]  standard time and I am your host Alex Jones hailing from deep in the heart of
[24:36.320 --> 24:45.480]  Texas Austin broadcasting worldwide from the info wars dot com studios and we
[24:45.480 --> 24:52.880]  are accelerating to attack speed against the globalists you're thinking like a
[24:52.880 --> 24:58.840]  fool because all it takes is you and I and the fortune that I am seeking is
[24:58.840 --> 25:08.920]  liberty in my time and in the future I want a society based on truth and
[25:08.920 --> 25:14.600]  justice and what you build and what you stand for not how good a bsr and liar
[25:14.600 --> 25:20.520]  you are not how delusional you are see the corrupt groups that get control
[25:20.520 --> 25:24.880]  throughout history always follow the same pattern it varies slightly but it
[25:24.880 --> 25:30.200]  goes the same direction and they are basically making every federal and state
[25:30.200 --> 25:35.520]  agency secret police and giving them a counter insurgents spy training
[25:35.520 --> 25:41.840]  propaganda training but all it does is fully discredit all these people as they
[25:41.840 --> 25:45.960]  go out because then they just start all lying to each other and then they're
[25:45.960 --> 25:51.160]  just a joke but but see the movies the culture it's sycophantic wear a black
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.760]  uniform wear a black mask raid people's houses set up checkpoints that's like the
[25:55.760 --> 26:01.040]  new culture not rockets to the moon not Marilyn Monroe not science not
[26:01.040 --> 26:06.240]  technology not the highest test scores not wealth not building construction
[26:06.240 --> 26:11.440]  projects not beautiful art it's just a bunch of thugs standing around acting
[26:11.440 --> 26:16.960]  tough who don't have a brain cell in their little noggin's that's the culture
[26:16.960 --> 26:22.200]  not breaking the sound barrier not splitting the atom not cyclotrons not
[26:22.200 --> 26:27.320]  curing cancer no it's giving people cancer it's giving them GMO it's
[26:27.320 --> 26:32.680]  dumbing them down it's poisoning them it's manifesting a fraud ahead of the
[26:32.680 --> 26:37.000]  singularity where we won't be needed anymore and already in China at Foxcom
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.480]  and all the other big factories are putting in the orders or have already
[26:41.480 --> 26:48.160]  gotten delivery of millions of robots a month to replace the billion 300 million
[26:48.160 --> 26:54.640]  Chinese and all the establishment white papers and publications that are public
[26:54.640 --> 26:58.560]  because they think you're so stupid it's public say that when they get done and
[26:58.560 --> 27:02.040]  put the robots in place they're only meant to supplant you so you're not
[27:02.040 --> 27:07.920]  needed so they have a automated combat system of autonomous drones and ground
[27:07.920 --> 27:14.560]  drones and surface water drones and underwater sub drones and and and smart
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.320]  dust drones and nano tech drones and the minute it's in place and the
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.440]  actuaries and the war game show that they've got a very high probability of
[27:23.440 --> 27:27.720]  winning they're gonna launch a skynet attack on any countries or groups or
[27:27.720 --> 27:33.240]  people that they haven't already wiped out with bio weapon attacks and I just
[27:33.240 --> 27:36.680]  want everybody to know that's what this is and that's where all this is going
[27:36.680 --> 27:41.160]  and you can laugh all you want and not read Club of Rome documents and not
[27:41.160 --> 27:44.600]  read futurist public stuff out of raker as well and all the big globalist
[27:44.600 --> 27:47.600]  meetings they're having where they talk about how once they merge with the
[27:47.600 --> 27:52.400]  machines you're gonna be like a bug to them and they're gonna sit on you you're
[27:52.400 --> 27:56.200]  not even gonna be a concern now again whether that happens or not they think
[27:56.200 --> 28:00.520]  that and that's the crazy stuff the ruling establishment is pushing and
[28:00.520 --> 28:06.720]  building right now now I guess acting trendy isn't that important anymore huh
[28:06.720 --> 28:11.240]  but see they want to make you trendy and the White House is announcing hiding
[28:11.240 --> 28:16.080]  in plain view every federal agency is gonna launch models and trendies

[34:14.240 --> 34:19.360]  they'll probably get a Pulitzer prize or something and continuing the Hollywood
[34:19.360 --> 34:26.160]  reporter is reporting right here the chilling history of how Hollywood helped
[34:26.160 --> 34:32.800]  Hitler oh you mean Time Magazine saying what a wonderful man he was in 1939 and
[34:32.800 --> 34:38.720]  and Hitler was told by US intelligence groups and British intelligence
[34:38.720 --> 34:45.320]  groups to launch attacks on Poland and then on France and and others and Danzig
[34:45.320 --> 34:50.600]  before that and of course Austria and then was set up again I don't think
[34:50.600 --> 34:55.880]  Hitler was a good guy it's just it's declassified folks that he was created
[34:55.880 --> 35:04.040]  funded and then just like Saddam Hussein and then double-crossed Saddam Hussein
[35:04.040 --> 35:08.520]  was told by the US government on record to attack Iran and for seven years
[35:08.520 --> 35:13.480]  funded he was told to nerve gas the Kurds and the CIA was there with weather
[35:13.480 --> 35:19.320]  reports telling him when to spray it and how so it wouldn't blow back I'm gonna
[35:19.320 --> 35:22.560]  be getting into that again it's not the US government it's the big offshore

[36:07.000 --> 36:14.080]  called our uncle in our media for decades how loving he was how we needed to be
[36:14.080 --> 36:21.000]  under people like Stalin Stalin the man of steel oh and two articles the
[36:21.000 --> 36:26.320]  chilling history of how Hollywood helped Hitler really and who were the people

[37:12.960 --> 37:16.320]  by the government show documents I tell you they've already launched blimps that
[37:16.320 --> 37:20.840]  are tethered to surveil you and and look right through your walls give all the
[37:20.840 --> 37:26.320]  documents I say that Hollywood and the British and US banks created Hitler and
[37:26.320 --> 37:31.080]  I show all the documents and proof before it was in the London Guardian two
[37:31.080 --> 37:34.960]  years later and they said they broke it they didn't break it it was in mainline
[37:34.960 --> 37:41.240]  Nuremberg documents that came out in 1946 and 47 this stuff I've interviewed
[37:41.240 --> 37:45.000]  Anthony Sutton folks I've interviewed the congressional committee heads who
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.040]  were there when all this came out I've interviewed Pete staffers who were
[37:48.040 --> 37:55.440]  involved in the McCormick-Dickstein committee back in the 1930s that
[37:55.440 --> 37:59.040]  particular lawyers dead now just like I interviewed Admiral Moore chairman of the
[37:59.040 --> 38:04.160]  joint chiefs of staff who was there when the president came over the radio and
[38:04.160 --> 38:08.960]  ordered the Mediterranean fleet to stand down at the USS Liberty while it was
[38:08.960 --> 38:13.160]  being attacked for over two hours I mean I just it's a treasure trove of who
[38:13.160 --> 38:16.800]  we've interviewed and I mean I've interviewed not just Admiral Moore but
[38:16.800 --> 38:24.880]  the other admirals fleet admirals that were there was it flag admirals the one
[38:24.880 --> 38:31.960]  out front if I and I've interviewed the rare admirals that were here in the
[38:31.960 --> 38:35.400]  communiques I mean I've literally interviewed on the USS Liberty alone
[38:35.400 --> 38:42.320]  probably more than 10 admirals the captain before he died McGonigal the
[38:42.320 --> 38:47.440]  first mate the doctor the just I mean I know everything about that I've
[38:47.440 --> 38:52.720]  interviewed dozens of people who heard LBJ when they refused the order of the
[38:52.720 --> 38:57.160]  Secretary-Defense McNamara to turn the jets back they had aircraft carriers just
[38:57.160 --> 39:01.880]  60 miles away when the president came on and said that GD ships go into the
[39:01.880 --> 39:06.920]  bottom and that's an order we're blaming that on Egypt which is an operation
[39:06.920 --> 39:13.760]  with Israel to false flag now you follow my orders and you stand down I just
[39:13.760 --> 39:17.280]  quoted what the admirals heard imagine in the ready room you think Benghazi's
[39:17.280 --> 39:21.640]  bad ordering a stand down so they could kill the ambassador I've interviewed all
[39:21.640 --> 39:25.440]  the people that were there and heard the president say that ships going to the
[39:25.440 --> 39:31.400]  GD bottom well guess what the most highly decorated ship in US history that
[39:31.400 --> 39:36.280]  got hit by torpedoes thousands of rounds of heavy caliber machine gun
[39:36.280 --> 39:41.240]  hundreds of rockets they could not sink it and so those guys got back to port and
[39:41.240 --> 39:45.560]  were told you will be court-martialed and executed under national security if
[39:45.560 --> 39:48.720]  you ever talk to anybody about what happened I've interviewed the people
[39:48.720 --> 39:52.240]  that were marched on the aircraft carrier and the and the admiral came out
[39:52.240 --> 39:56.440]  and said tell me your story they told the story and he said you will be
[39:56.440 --> 40:03.560]  executed they said we will kill you kill you kill you kill you kill you kill you
[40:03.560 --> 40:07.800]  kill you if you ever tell anybody I've interviewed the people that were there
[40:07.800 --> 40:14.240]  on the admiral said we will kill you you will be killed just like SEAL Team 6 is
[40:14.240 --> 40:17.640]  being killed ladies and gentlemen how many of the SEAL Team 6 at the fake

[40:45.080 --> 40:48.440]  probably sending retired SEALs that have been sheep dipped to kill them that's
[40:48.440 --> 40:57.920]  what you do in America you kill Navy SEALs for the foreign banks USA USA USA I
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.240]  mean this is all a load of bull ladies and gentlemen our country's been taken
[41:02.240 --> 41:06.040]  over by foreign banks and they think you're such a joke that you won't wake
[41:06.040 --> 41:10.880]  up and do anything about it I told you two weeks after the helicopter blew up
[41:10.880 --> 41:16.320]  how long go to the helicopter blow up killing 23 SEALs then they never it was
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.480]  almost two years ago now and I and then I talked to a family friend who is a
[41:21.480 --> 41:25.440]  Navy SEAL we know him through his father but known the Navy SEAL for over a
[41:25.440 --> 41:30.440]  decade before he was in the Navy my dad knew him back when he was in high school
[41:30.440 --> 41:35.120]  and they said no we know they blew up the helicopter some of the guys think
[41:35.120 --> 41:38.440]  Al Qaeda got a bomb on there but there's no way they could and they never put us
[41:38.440 --> 41:41.560]  all on this you look like that and we weren't going on a rescue mission it
[41:41.560 --> 41:45.400]  turned out that was all fake so they think it's a setup by Obama well of
[41:45.400 --> 41:48.160]  course she what are we doing oh what's the mission just you're gonna you're
[41:48.160 --> 41:53.280]  going somewhere I mean I shouldn't laugh about this it's so sick and then they
[41:53.280 --> 41:57.760]  just fly it out and blow it up you're going where Pat Tillman went he died
[41:57.760 --> 42:03.760]  charging an Al Qaeda machine gun nesting those SEALs all died those SEALs all
[42:03.760 --> 42:10.600]  died going to fight Al Qaeda and rescue and rescue Army Rangers the truth is
[42:10.600 --> 42:14.560]  there was a bomb on board that's known and the entire Navy knows it there the
[42:14.560 --> 42:19.560]  Navy's freaked out about it it blew up but they survived the helicopter made
[42:19.560 --> 42:23.840]  it the ground when they got out guess what happened they were surrounded by
[42:23.840 --> 42:29.880]  waiting groups at long distance killing them with 50 caliber rifles and then you
[42:29.880 --> 42:33.920]  know who has 50 caliber rifles don't you and by the way you know they're gonna
[42:33.920 --> 42:37.800]  kill the contractors that killed the SEALs right you know you're all dead too
[42:37.800 --> 42:42.520]  morons that's what I love about all this see you're going on a mission to
[42:42.520 --> 42:46.680]  make sure no SEALs escape from the fake bin Laden raid and then you're gonna kill
[42:46.680 --> 42:53.120]  Navy SEALs because you're a tough guy contractor because you were under armor
[42:53.120 --> 42:57.680]  and stand around when they're real when they're leading Bradley Manning around
[42:57.680 --> 43:03.320]  you're a you're a contractor above the special forces let me just fools you can

[43:13.240 --> 43:20.760]  you're stupid and that's exactly what Michael Hastings said he said it's time
[43:20.760 --> 43:24.360]  to stop not releasing so-called national security stuff when it's
[43:24.360 --> 43:29.640]  government crime it's time for the press to declare war on the corrupt groups
[43:29.640 --> 43:35.680]  that have taken over and they blew his car up they blew his car up and now it
[43:35.680 --> 43:38.160]  does look like the real surveillance footage has been released he's driving
[43:38.160 --> 43:47.200]  along as a witness to say boom you see a flash then it goes off the road and you
[43:47.200 --> 43:50.520]  know I flip out on air you know I don't mean to because just the enormity of
[43:50.520 --> 43:54.800]  of what we're under hits me and I start freaking out because I know they can come
[43:54.800 --> 43:58.560]  kill me anytime I know they can kill my whole family I realize how real this is
[43:58.560 --> 44:03.800]  and I get very angry at the public who is sitting there with their thumbs you
[44:03.800 --> 44:10.760]  know where having no idea how bad this is ladies and gentlemen and that a
[44:10.760 --> 44:14.240]  conscious decision has been made to bring in pure evil and eradicate
[44:14.240 --> 44:17.960]  liberty in this country and reeducate what's left of this nation and it's in
[44:17.960 --> 44:21.400]  the army manuals it's all documented it's all on record and now they're
[44:21.400 --> 44:26.000]  everywhere going yeah we're gonna send psyops into to the public schools to
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.880]  make sure your kids go along with the agenda of anti-gun that's in the news
[44:28.880 --> 44:31.560]  today and we're gonna have the social security administration carry out
[44:31.560 --> 44:35.320]  psychological warfare ops on the public and we're gonna have every other federal
[44:35.320 --> 44:39.880]  agency do it and we're watching you and we're going to finance all media and
[44:39.880 --> 44:42.880]  we're gonna buy off all the bloggers they've already bought them off I know
[44:42.880 --> 44:46.560]  all sorts of people that got paid and start attacking me in line about me and
[44:46.560 --> 44:50.320]  you know saying vote for Obama and you know stuff like that I mean it's so
[44:50.320 --> 44:54.760]  obvious I mean if I've been offered money before people go why don't you tell
[44:54.760 --> 44:58.600]  us who offered it you never get news again or offers if you see people say
[44:58.600 --> 45:02.160]  this is a meeting we'd like to hire you talk about you coming to work for this

[45:06.480 --> 45:10.720]  disclosure agreements and then if you ever go and talk about something like
[45:10.720 --> 45:16.800]  that then it it's you know then you never get offers or info again it's very
[45:16.800 --> 45:23.360]  simple my word is my my my bond I've got to get when I get emotional I've got to
[45:23.360 --> 45:31.600]  get better about not blurting things out last week I talked about how Judge
[45:31.600 --> 45:35.520]  Andrew de Palatano you know was told by news corps don't go back on Alex Jones's
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.760]  show and then I was told by another executive separately that like look we
[45:39.760 --> 45:43.440]  know what's going on we're awake but you know Eric Holder could just come arrest
[45:43.440 --> 45:46.600]  a bunch of people at news corps and that's being held over our head not
[45:46.600 --> 45:51.680]  with any concerns with trying to hire me that was just a whole side issue I want
[45:51.680 --> 45:55.160]  to make that make sure that's clear it was it and I told you two or three years
[45:55.160 --> 45:59.760]  ago they they're gonna threaten to arrest Rupert Murdoch and then that came
[45:59.760 --> 46:06.400]  out last week in the news they're looking at arresting him Holder for the
[46:06.400 --> 46:09.880]  supposed phone hacking and stuff which went on certainly of course they knew
[46:09.880 --> 46:13.120]  about it that's standard procedure and media at that level that's what Murdoch
[46:13.120 --> 46:16.480]  got recorded saying he's being set up folks he's got intelligence ops all
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.280]  over him they've got Navy SEALs f-former FBI guys guarding all the top Fox
[46:21.280 --> 46:24.920]  people Glenn Beck's got like a security team of 20 people on average I mean

[46:28.320 --> 46:31.520]  stuff get to him and it's not that Murdoch's even some good guy he's just
[46:31.520 --> 46:34.840]  been playing a double game and now these mafias are trying to knock each other
[46:34.840 --> 46:40.360]  off you know I told you that the Navy SEALs thought they were killed their
[46:40.360 --> 46:44.080]  families and now we reprint me that we had it on info or if I want to read his
[46:44.080 --> 46:47.720]  name now one of the fathers of one of the SEAL team six guys that died who by
[46:47.720 --> 46:51.080]  the way was in on the bin Laden raid has gone public saying oh yeah the SEALs
[46:51.080 --> 46:54.200]  think they blew the helicopter up and killed them out there and then it was a
[46:54.200 --> 46:57.680]  setup and the mission wasn't real what did I tell you a year and a half ago when
[46:57.680 --> 47:03.080]  that happened what did I tell you what did I tell you within a few I told you
[47:03.080 --> 47:10.280]  that exact thing folks I don't make this stuff up you know I said why don't you
[47:10.280 --> 47:13.920]  come on the air and they said are you kidding I'd be arrested immediately for
[47:13.920 --> 47:17.920]  even talking about operations and all they would say was is yeah no they think
[47:17.920 --> 47:20.720]  there was a bomb on board and then they were waiting for them when there were
[47:20.720 --> 47:25.440]  survivors and that's what the family of SEAL team six members are now saying and
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.080]  that's the press conference they had yeah that's the one with Billy Vaughn the

[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.840]  ladies and gentlemen we are now into hour number two
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.840]  on this Wednesday Worldwide Transmission
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.840]  coming up in the next segment Steve Jolly
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:48.840]  is a campaigner journalist and spokesman
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.840]  for the campaign group NoCCTV
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.840]  and they've been having victories in the courts
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.840]  saying it's unconstitutional in England to have them up
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.840]  and by the way I don't see those articles in this big stack
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.840]  they may be there can we print up that we're a court rules that
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.840]  CCTVs do violate rights in England I want to show that he's been able to do that
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.840]  Steve Jolly pop it in for a couple segments
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:15.840]  and then we'll open the phones up and take your phone calls
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.840]  you know I kind of went hyperbolic
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.840]  I guess you could call it that in the last hour
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:26.840]  just because it flips me out
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.840]  how people serve the most dark evil things they can
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.840]  and kind of a mass Stockholm syndrome that I talk so much about
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:36.840]  but even the contractors the black water type people
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.840]  they think it's so sexy to kill their own mother if ordered to
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.840]  they don't realize how that makes them have no future
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.840]  their children have no future when no one has honor
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.840]  it's manly and strong to have a code of ethics
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:51.840]  and I remember when it first came out about black water
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:54.840]  and other groups who would be like on cocaine naked
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.840]  running around the streets of Baghdad shooting up people's cars
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.840]  and we'd hear the reports later confirmed in federal documents
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:04.840]  and just people that are so self-destructive
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.840]  because they know they have no future they know they've ruined themselves
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.840]  they know they've been typecast and chosen because they're losers
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.840]  and so they just go out and try to wallow in it
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.840]  and then they're just basket cases later
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:20.840]  and then we all bow down to it because anything in a uniform is God
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:24.840]  and that's how you get Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Malice, China
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:30.840]  and now you have the authoritarian rollout
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.840]  if you just joined us all over the news
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.840]  youth corps rolling out
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:40.840]  every federal administration
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.840]  every federal agency
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:48.840]  Social Security announcing PSYOP brigades
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.840]  and then now if I go to any festival
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.840]  they'll have different youth groups, FEMA youth
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.840]  there was under a secure core FEMA youth deal
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.840]  my wife went to a marathon in Waco
[01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:06.840]  and she's there and she's like goes over and talks to people
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.840]  these youth in like camouflage uniforms
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.840]  and then they had adults come over and go don't talk to them
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.840]  they're part of the security
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.840]  and it was like kids sitting on a walkie-talkie
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.840]  looking at people and just like man this is how it happens
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.840]  people are like what's wrong with them
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.840]  it's like Civil Air Patrol they're learning
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.840]  you know in ROTC yeah but the ROTC grapes
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.840]  this wasn't ROTC this was high schoolers
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:32.840]  they train for decades in scenarios to fight the militias and gun owners
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.840]  I mean the government I can show you New York Times
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.840]  scouts train to fight terrorists and more
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.840]  and it says you know the veteran won't turn in the guns
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.840]  the scouts move in and take him out
[01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.840]  and then it shows dozens and dozens of photos
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.840]  of the this is like four years ago now
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.840]  the Boy Scouts killing the veteran
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.840]  the Boy Scouts in the Explorer Scout program
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.840]  train to kill gun owners
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.840]  and come to our houses and kill us
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.840]  and I saw the guys going ah train the military
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.840]  five years Marines
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.840]  I'm not scared of these 14 year olds you better be
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.840]  because they're always stupid they make the best soldiers
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.840]  and anybody that knows about real warfare knows that

[01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.840]  it's another thing to see the entire situation now unfolding
[01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:08.840]  as every federal agency comes out and announces that they're going to be engaging
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:11.840]  in brainwashing and deceiving the American people
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.840]  Psyops
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:16.840]  and the first Psyops is the Pentagon telling you they're not going to lie to you anymore

[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.840]  reason.com
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.840]  Social Security Administration now hiring for counterintelligence operations
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:50.840]  that was in the New York Daily News a few weeks ago that police trained at the public are all insurgents
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:56.840]  MIT, again, I take MIT magazine after I'd seen it a few times and read it
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:04.840]  and in it, it's almost every issue is like the system in Fallujah of biometric scanning and control
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.840]  of the population including security groups that ask questions of the population
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:15.840]  and then feed the messages of freedom down to the locals was developed in the warfare program at MIT
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:21.840]  with the control grid and then works with the psychology department from the Harvard department of psychology and psychiatry
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:27.840]  these systems are also being deployed in a softer fashion in the United States for continued security
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:33.840]  I mean they're using our money and all the science to jack us up folks
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.840]  face scanning cameras license plate reading cameras stores now using cameras to know if you have more money
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:43.840]  to then gouge you and charge you more this is all coming out everything I told you
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.840]  you're like why doesn't the hide let them well why then do you not put your home address and what you own on Facebook
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:55.840]  because when you do thieves use it to rob you well what about the organized thieves that run the government
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:02.840]  what about Facebook selling your data Twitter selling your data Google selling your data see see it's not that you had something to hide
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:09.840]  why don't have a glass house then leave your doors open in the middle of Detroit or Chicago because there's bad people out there
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:16.840]  you need some walls to protect you but you don't get those government gets those and all its crimes are hidden under national security
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:22.840]  you don't aim a camera at them it's espionage you don't get a camera on the street the police they don't film us will arrest you
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:30.840]  there's not even a law they still do it from Austin Texas to Chicago Illinois from Los Angeles California to Manhattan in New York
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:41.840]  the Big Apple because it's authoritarianism but now they're saying it's freedom to be a slave and the Social Security Administration
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:48.840]  joining the Defense Department effort to downplay negative news and lie and then the Daily Caller makes a joke
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:56.840]  attention Alex Jones get ready for behavioral insight teams to manipulate us but it's still funny it's still funny
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:03.840]  they're gonna have youth course coming after us arrogantly bossing us around on TV everywhere and forced messages on our phones
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:10.840]  and in the public schools it's alright though it's alright to everywhere I go now they have different federally funded groups of kids
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:21.840]  in uniforms bossing people around with walkie talkies I mean that's not bad just where I live in central Texas I run into it every month now
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:31.840]  first time I ever saw it was footage we got in Hebron Maryland in 1998 school children the Boy Scouts training to rat out their parents for guns
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.840]  the parents had agreed to have them part of this training to have the Marines come to Hebron Maryland have their guns taken
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:40.840]  we have footage of it in police state 2000 you might want to see the film it's free online
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.840]  let me get it on the trilogy on DVD in higher quality if you want to support us at m4store.com
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:51.840]  you know it just kind of freaks you out when you go the Marines are training with the Boy Scouts to confiscate guns door to door
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:58.840]  and then you just get article after article after video after video and you confirm it and then now it's in the New York Times
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:05.840]  in articles like Scouts Train to Fight Terrorist and more and you're like well that's that's that's the Soviet youth corps
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:12.840]  that's the malice youth corps that's the Hitler Eugen but enough from me let's go to our guests we're gonna be getting into all that
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.840]  Steve Jolly is a campaigner and journalist and spokesman for the campaign group No CCTV
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:22.840]  his successful campaign against project champion of police surveillance operation in Birmingham UK
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:29.840]  forced the chief constable to publicly apologize scrap the scheme and remove 216 surveillance cameras from parts of the city
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:38.840]  he was nominated for the Human Rights Award in 2010 and appeared for the UK parliament to give evidence of the protection of freedoms bill about CCTV law
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:47.840]  Steve gives radio television interviews and it's truthjustice.co.uk truthjustice.co.uk and I got to work it's a truth juice excuse me
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:55.840]  truthjuice.co.uk I did a Freudian slip and just have justice on the mind truthjuice.co.uk I do that sometimes
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:04.840]  and he goes around wearing a big paper mache CCTV camera on his head and it really gets the attention and it's a great way
[01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:10.840]  and I got a chance to work with him covering Bilderberg 2013 in the UK and have dinner with him a few times
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:18.840]  and with other reporters like Shilkey and Paul Watson and everybody else Steve Watson you name it and it's good to have you on with us
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:25.840]  and there's been other victories now in the UK and in Australia so you guys are certainly on the March we salute what you're doing
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:28.840]  well thank you very much for having me on this show Alex
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:35.840]  well get into it tell people about your saga why you got involved what you've been able to do and some of your greatest hits that others can
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:38.840]  hopefully duplicate and imitate
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:47.840]  okay I became an activist almost by accident really when this massive surveillance operation was mounted it just appeared overnight
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:55.840]  literally overnight in the dead of night hundreds of cameras appeared all over residential neighborhoods in my home city of Birmingham in the UK
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:15:06.840]  and nobody knew anything about it and we quickly discovered that it wasn't anything to do with community safety or low level local crime and policing
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:14.840]  it was an MI5 surveillance spying operation targeting those parts of the city that were deemed to have a lot of Muslims living there
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:18.840]  and obviously this caused a lot of upset and outcry at the time
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:26.840]  and basically there was a major backlash a lot of media attention and the police force were on the back foot from day one
[01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.840]  they didn't even finish installing the cameras before they had a major PR crisis on their hands
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:38.840]  and to cut a long story short the Chief Constable of West Midlands Police ended up having to publicly apologize on TV
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.840]  to the people of Birmingham and remove all of those cameras and scrap the scheme
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:48.840]  so that was how I got involved in fighting against Big Brother
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:59.840]  but I didn't stop there I chose to carry on because I'd found out a lot about the expansion and the proliferation of the surveillance state in its various forms
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:07.840]  and not enough people were really fully aware of how insidious and how extensive it is
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:17.840]  and so I decided to carry on and challenge not just that particular scheme in one place but the whole lot across the whole country
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:26.840]  and further afield and the whole network of number plate scanning cameras that you mentioned earlier
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:36.840]  is a major surveillance scheme we used to refer to it as the biggest surveillance grid that you've never heard of
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.840]  but people are starting to hear of it now people are starting to get concerned about it
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:49.840]  and we're having victories so what I'm hoping to show is that people, individual, ordinary people can challenge it and can have successes
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:59.840]  when you try you can see how powerful you can be so hopefully that's the message we'll get across today
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:06.840]  absolutely and I tell you it was very empowering to see thousands of people out demonstrating against the Bilderberg group
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:14.840]  but still there's the system protecting them when none of us had done anything wrong when we know the people inside of the ones committing the real crime
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:19.840]  so I love how the government's all secretive and these corporate combines are all secretive
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:24.840]  and Eric Schmidt of Google is secretive with a literal harem of women
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:32.840]  he has wear masks like Michael Jackson slaves but at the same time none of us were supposedly have any privacy
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:40.840]  well that's it when we're at the Bilderberg protest I couldn't help but notice that the police had erected a temporary surveillance camera
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:47.840]  on a huge telescopic pole sticking out of a police van that was parked by the entrance simply to film the photographers
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:52.840]  who were trying to get pictures of the attendees arriving in their blacked out limos
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:59.840]  so it was the reporters and the photographers who were under surveillance simply for wanting to know what the conference was about
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:04.840]  who was attending and what were they discussing in there so the people trying to uncover the truth they were under surveillance
[01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:13.840]  while the people going in and making these huge decisions about global policy were ushered in behind smoke glass
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:18.840]  and they were covering their faces with newspapers so they get the privacy they get the anonymity we get none of it
[01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:24.840]  we get the surveillance and we get our faces filmed and indeed we were told we weren't allowed to cover our faces
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:30.840]  because obviously if you were the police then to them that implies some criminal intent
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:37.840]  and I deliberately went there with as you say a cardboard model of a CCTV camera to stick on my head
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:46.840]  just to make that point that who's watching these people and also that the constant surveillance that we have to put up with
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:53.840]  really isn't right isn't normal and we've got to challenge that
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:58.840]  well you're an example of what a person in the right can do standing up against wrongs
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:06.840]  and there's so many examples we had yesterday the gentleman on who was told he had to have all this insurance
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.840]  and have home inspections and be harassed and had to have a disaster plan
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:17.840]  he'd had his rabbits for 20 plus years as a magician and he finally stood up to them
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:22.840]  so now they're backing off on all this harassment over what they were telling him to do to have a rabbit
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:25.840]  when it wasn't even the law it was their fake regulations
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:32.840]  it's just an example of how like international groups transferring bio weapons have it written whether there's no regulations on them
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:39.840]  but then they're saying that we have no privacy to have blimps over us looking through our walls with ground penetrating radar
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:47.840]  Steve Jolly is our guest and he has the group in the UK fighting against the surveillance grid
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:51.840]  I want to talk about how serious this grid has gotten with him on the other side

[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:23.840]  Steve Jolly is a very effective and successful civil liberties campaigner in the UK
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.840]  and he's been imitated worldwide I've got articles here about him removing him in Australia you name it
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:34.840]  but I mean here's the deal just like you've seen people in federal cases and state cases
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:40.840]  though I want my NSA records to prove where I was to prove where I was driving
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.840]  and the police and the government aren't wanting to let people use the face scanning networks
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:51.840]  the license plate reading networks all over the western world these have been put in for at least 15-20 years
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:58.840]  because it's not meant to stop crime it's meant to stop people that aren't paying their cut
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:03.840]  their Mordito their their kickback to the system
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:07.840]  and that's all this is for I've talked to the military it's come out congressional hearings
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:12.840]  well they'll sit there with the radar and the tail beacon you know the beacon on the aircraft going
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:18.840]  let that aircraft in don't let that one in depending on whose drugs it is
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:25.840]  and they use this to manage the whole criminal network and to give the criminals that run the government the leg up
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:31.840]  and they always sell it oh we're just putting cameras in the neighborhoods looking at the houses of the Muslims bull
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:35.840]  it's everybody you see the tapes where one's in the backyard of some guy and he's walking in
[01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:40.840]  and he's put something his own trash and the CCTV camera says what are you doing there
[01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:45.840]  answer my questions I mean literal telescreens now so talking to Steve Jolly Steve
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:53.840]  England it's been said is the most advanced in this system of beyond 1984
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:58.840]  go over some of the horrors that you guys are under
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:08.840]  well we started before anybody else really you know Britain began the rollout of CCTV decades ago
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:14.840]  and we've we've had we've really pursued it with vigor and you know recent guesstimates
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:20.840]  of estimated that we've got something like almost six million of these surveillance cameras
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.840]  nobody really knows how many but we know that the number keeps rising
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:33.840]  we've got some the automatic number plate recognition system which is even worse in my view
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:39.840]  because it's linked to it's linked to a back office system there's software there
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:44.840]  that's a huge database for gathering intelligence and data mining
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:51.840]  and I just want to just focus in for me a little bit on that because this is this is really rolling out in America now
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:57.840]  and it a NPR or ALPR as you call it there automatic license plate recognition cameras
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:03.840]  it's the fastest growing police technology in the States and they're rolling it out like there's no tomorrow
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:09.840]  they're installing it in police cars and it won't be long I'm sure before they're installed on motorway bridges
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:18.840]  and on poles and this allows them to harass certain people it allows I mean it is just unbelievably beyond Big Brother
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:24.840]  well what it is it's a system of internal checkpoints vehicle checkpoints
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.840]  you don't have to stop your vehicle you don't have to produce your papers
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.840]  and wait while a policeman or a soldier gets on the phone to check you out and then says okay you can carry on
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:40.840]  it's all done as you drive by and you don't see it you don't see the police state you don't notice it
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:48.840]  it's digital it's automatic it's invisible but it's effectively creating a series of internal borders and checkpoints
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:55.840]  and they're going to use it to tax everybody that's already begun in Germany the Siemens company IBM
[01:27:55.840 --> 01:28:01.840]  England starting it they're on record saying they're going to track everything you do and use it for carbon taxing
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:08.840]  well that's right the Rothschild plan as it's known was presented to the three main parties here in the UK before the election
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:14.840]  and that recommended that they sell off all our road network to Chinese state companies and they're going to be toll roads
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:22.840]  and you can look this up oh yeah I forgot about that and your data mining in the UK is run by a communist Chinese party control deal
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:30.840]  well I can give you an example as to why these number plate cameras are worse than people realize it's not just about toll roads
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:38.840]  and raising revenue and issuing fines one of the main companies in the US that's manufacturing these ALPR cameras
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:46.840]  is a company called plate scan now they are a technology partner with Incutel who is you know the CIA
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:54.840]  yeah it's the venture capital and technology arm of the CIA so it's the central intelligence agency so this is a huge intelligence
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:02.840]  gathering exercise and so the police say oh well you we just want to recover stolen vehicles and we're just looking for
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:12.840]  wanted criminals who are on the run no this is the googling of reality where they're putting really the smart dust scanning grid out there
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:18.840]  to totally control everything and feed it into these giant NSA systems on record
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:26.840]  yeah and you know these cameras because they link to software which is linked to various databases they investigate you in real time
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:36.840]  so every time you drive past one you're run through 34 different databases and also the software that stores and records and just logs
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:42.840]  every journey you make can have intelligence files attached to stay there I want to come back and finish up with this with our guest
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:48.840]  but of course it'll never be used to stop the guys really committing the crimes they run the cameras
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:58.840]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:28.840]  you know the reason I start hyperventilating on air is that all I do study this stuff and I know the people running it are eugenicist anti human people that are building a very dark world
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:42.840]  and I get desperately frustrated for just humanity in general to know that we're paying for our own enslavement and I'm gonna break down some key final facets with our guest and just talk about what the license plate reading systems are
[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:53.840]  I mean we're all basically wearing numbers like the IBM numbers that Jews had in the camps that's what this is and it's run by the people that created Hitler and I have articles on that today
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:34:05.840]  Hitler wasn't controlled by the new world order he was created and pointed like a wind up toy we're gonna get to that in a moment but people a decade from now 20 years from now
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:17.840]  if we don't turn this around are gonna look back on these type of broadcast as as just emergency distress signals and why didn't you listen because there's no debate I'm absolutely right
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:41.840]  no debate in fact I cannot with my intellect and semantical repertoire display verbally with the powers of oratory convention what we are facing in its total panoptagonic atomic and subatomic dimensions
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:53.840]  it is the synthesis the scientific deployment of sadism now before we go back to our guest to conclude with him and then I'm open the phones up for any of the news we've covered today
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:35:01.840]  what do you think of the announcement every federal agency to have psyops counter insurgent operations you were seen as an insurgent by Social Security Administration

[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:33.840]  we're going to break all that down after our guest leaves us but briefly some of the sponsors that make this show possible I only endorse what I believe in and private internet access dot com is simply amazing

[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:16.840]  alike it's pretty amazing as human beings one was short little fat the other tall but the faces look a lot similar and the point is it's all about divide
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:23.840]  and conquer sure that story is all blown over this is about the science of trying to create race war and divide and conquer and that's not all that is covered
[01:37:23.840 --> 01:37:32.840]  in the 60 page glossy magazine a federal government plans to persecute Zimmerman we get into that it's got a big film the police poster in the
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:43.840]  middle and it's just got scores of articles throughout the magazine on the Russian troops in America on how they're setting up the bombing
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:54.840]  patsy as the supposed bomber we get into the fact there's no blood coming out his throat I mean just a whole bunch of really important articles a bunch of great

[01:38:52.840 --> 01:39:06.840]  we found the actual price that we set this morning and then get 100 stickers with the 10 yeah it is a 1495 for a 10 pack and that will have 100 bumper stickers in it to bomb your area legally
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:14.840]  with that info weapon you heard the Navy seal calling yesterday that woke up because somebody spray painted on a billboard info wars dot com outside the seal base
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:22.840]  and a lot of other seals woke up from just going and checking it out well let's not spray paint on billboards unless they're government billboards there are the enemies that have taken over
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:31.840]  propagandizing us in our face but I'm not telling you to do it I think I might do it myself though the whole point is is the time for games is really getting to be over here
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:49.840]  the point is is that put them on your own property these bumper stickers info wars store dot com or call 8882533139 or 8882533139 to get the July issue before it sells out with a 10 free bumper stickers in each one
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:40:00.840]  or to get the new August issue to really wake people up that are programmed by the left right paradigm and the whole race war garbage okay plugging done ladies and gentlemen that's what funds our operation and gets the word out
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:14.840]  let us now go back for the points he was making about the license plate scanning cameras face scanning cameras stores putting them in hooked into the database bars putting them in hooked into the driver's license database
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:31.840]  they're getting all the companies to share in it face book kiosk where you walk by it knows who you are in New York L.A. they are bum rushing us with this and this is the bad guys running the system imagine what Hitler would have done with a system like this
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  it is absolutely amazing but when you go to DC or other cities you try to film anywhere the cops come over and threaten to arrest you outside of law because you're scum you can't film how many people taking photos of their family the cops come over anywhere
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:41:03.840]  and they want to peck you like North Korea they've been told to break your will going back to Steve Jolly is one of the most successful anti CCTV camera folks out there will actually give you his website as well it's truthjuice.co.uk you've got the floor
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:18.840]  sir for the next five minutes or so to finish the points you were just making thanks Alex truthjuice is another organization actually I'm with no CCTV that's no hyphen CCTV I just butcher that over and over again that's just what I had on my site
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:31.840]  tell me about truthjuice who are those folks that were put on my page that's that's an organization that's growing around the UK that's a meetups and talks you are associated with it then somehow
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:41.840]  ah yeah there are groups all over I really apologize for butchering that give out your correct website for us yeah well give out your correct website for us sir
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:42:02.840]  okay it's no dash cctv.org.uk and there's a lot of information there if you want to find out the truth about the CCTV I mean Britain as I say it's had 30 years to to study it and its effects on crime and obviously what we're being told about that isn't the truth
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:12.840]  it's had no significant effect on crime but everyone believes that it must be affected because they keep telling us that but it's just simply a myth it's a lie
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:26.840]  we've also started an international group we're branching out further around the world so you know this isn't purely a UK thing obviously it's a global big brother problem
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:35.840]  there's now an international working group and you can find our blog there at wgs.wordpress.com
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:46.840]  that's the international working group on video surveillance so we're looking for groups around the world particularly in America now because that's really at the forefront of the expansion of the surveillance grid
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:56.840]  in the early stages but now you're going straight in with the new high tech stuff at rapid speed so if any groups in America want to contact us and join us in the fight then please do
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:05.840]  one of the lessons here I think is that when individuals or individual activists take a stand and challenge these things they can be really successful
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:18.840]  it's a mistake to think that the big brother surveillance state or the surveillance industrial complex is so vast and big and there's nothing you can do and it's dreadful but you can, you can challenge it, you can stop it
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:22.840]  but you have to challenge every little bit of it and you can't be everywhere at once
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:30.840]  I mean what about my analogy of the Jews had the IBM number put on them to track and control their calories and when to kill them or when not
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:38.840]  and others in Nazi Germany I mean now we're all our faces have been turned into numbers our fingerprints now they want to get on an iPhone they're going to make you
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:48.840]  IBM's announcing that Apple's announcing it Microsoft I mean it's time I've got to say people are going to just start bashing these out with baseball bats
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:56.840]  people are already shooting them out spray painting them out people kept sabotaging them in Arizona the libertarian groups did until they took them down
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:05.840]  I mean it's time to get aggressive now and I've never been like this but what about how they admit they're using this data to persecute groups they don't like
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.840]  this is illegal I mean this is wrong
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:27.840]  yeah absolutely just you know we mustn't we mustn't think that there's nothing we can do although there are you know as you say they're bringing facial recognition technology which seems to be getting more and more reliable in their view
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:37.840]  and that is basically a number plate for the face it's a number it's a barcode it's a face print there's something called face watch which is a wanted poster scheme that's really developing quite fast
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:45.840]  and in various countries around the world and that seems to be morphing into a global facial recognition database and that's one to keep an eye on
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:54.840]  but if I could go back to the number plate scanning cameras because that's a really major part of the surveillance grid the overall panopticon
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:45:09.840]  and we challenge the the whole ampere system in the UK by focusing on a small town called Royston in Cambridgeshire Hertfordshire the border of those those counties and basically we put in a formal legal complaint to the UK's
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:24.840]  governing body the information commissioner he really sort of enforces the data protection act which is a pretty pretty weak law but it's the only thing that we have to go on that relates to surveillance and the data gathered
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:33.840]  and even under that weak law we prove that what they were doing in this small town was unlawful they've encircled it with a ring of steel of number plate scanning cameras so you can't get in or out
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:46.840]  and that's precisely what they did in Birmingham they encircled two residential neighbourhoods two communities so that that was surrounded by a digital moat and everything crossing that virtual border was under surveillance
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:57.840]  and this seems to be what they want to do they want to put these cameras around kept towns cities counties and the motorway network and we're challenging the whole thing so when we when we challenged the cameras in Royston
[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:09.840]  that was really a way in to challenge the whole network of over 10,000 cameras and the UK's information commissioner agreed with us they took him two years to investigate and liaise with Hertfordshire police
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:28.840]  but after two years he came out and said you're right it's unlawful you know there's no lawful justification or excuse for doing it you know there's no intelligence there's no justifiable reason for surveilling
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:44.840]  there's no reasonable suspicion there's no probable cause under Magna Carta under common law and it's totally illegal and look at the US and in the UK they've caught MI6 and MI5 spying on parliament using your NSA systems they've caught them doing it here
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:57.840]  the cloakroom of the House and Senate have been bugged that came out and got no attention a month ago they're using it against pro-liberty groups that they call right wing they're not even right wing they're just pro-liberty constitution groups
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:10.840]  and we're being persecuted already there's more news out today how they use the IRS on pro-life groups I mean obviously this is being used they already have cops using ISIS plate cameras to harass good looking women
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:24.840]  there's been cases of that I mean we're giving these government and corporate people the corporate system is in bed look at the hundreds of billions of dollars made in the UK and the US the last 20 years on these spy grids
[01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:37.840]  I saw two billion was spent in Boston the last decade putting in cameras and it's incredible same thing in New York what about the defense contractors sucking us dry putting in our own enslavement system
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:54.840]  yeah it's the surveillance industrial complex you know we've long referred to the surveillance state but now with the privatization of everything and the massive boom in the drone industry and the whole military industrial complex surveillance is part of that it's big business
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:48:11.840]  so and we got you know when we were a builder but we had we had Google there right at the forefront of the surveillance industrial complex and what we're seeing is really the the idea of the citizen being thrown away and being recast as the suspect so everyone's a suspect so
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:25.840]  except the government that historically is out of control and super dangerous Steve Jolly thank you so much for the time I look forward to getting you on from time to time when you have new developments on the radio show and info wars nightly news and we salute you
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:29.840]  for the success that you've been having sir thank you so much
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:43.840]  thanks for having me on all right and folks I start getting really upset when I talk about this because I understand the type of people that run our government that run the EU and that run the UK they are more sophisticated than the communist more sophisticated than the Nazis
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:58.840]  more sophisticated than Mao Zedong they put them all in power look it up our government put Mao in power declassified six years ago we already knew that from the John Burt society but now it's public because John Burt's was there as an army intelligence guy and saw it all happening they killed him
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:13.840]  we know that's why it's named that we know about them creating Hitler we know about them creating Saddam Hussein creating Osama bin Laden I want to show you some articles of your radio listener pull these up but I'm showing these to TV viewers that are watching us on
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:41.840]  prisonplanet.tv Bank of England helped in sale of looted Nazi gold this is breaking and coming out today the Bank of England helped in the sale of stolen gold stolen by Nazis after the 1939 invasion of Czechoslovakia and then it goes on they helped right through and after the war of course they were out in 30 plus
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:59.840]  30 plus thousand top Nazis to run England and the United States to be the bosses over every department that's on record not just NASA but the CIA everything everyone the university heads would have a shadow chancellor who would be a Nazi officer
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:13.840]  I'm not looking up I mean just they're like yes you did the best you did a great job we promised you that after you did this we would bring you back over they help train them help fund them just like the Saddam Hussein's people and then they can have little fake wars with them basically
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:30.840]  so that's the BBC today now this is today Hollywood reporter the chilling history of how Hollywood helped Hitler in devastating detail an excerpt from a controversial new book reveals of the big studios desperate to protect German business let Nazi

[01:54:58.520 --> 01:54:59.520]  Welcome.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:00.520]  Hello, Alex.
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:01.520]  Hey, buddy.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:02.840]  Hey, well, let's see.
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:06.400]  First of all, I want to thank you so much for the Tangy Tangerine 2.0.
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:09.120]  I'm a 55-year-old newlywed.
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:13.920]  My wife and I have both been taking Vicodin for years for our backseat as arthritis.
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:15.720]  I was in a car wreck.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:21.880]  Even 10 days of taking the Tangy Tangerine 2.0, I was not taking any pain medicine whatsoever.
[01:55:21.880 --> 01:55:23.480]  So thank you so much.
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:25.920]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.200]  And the reason I was calling is I hope you can help me with relieving my heartache every
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:32.040]  day that I wake up.
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:39.360]  Ever since I saw the broadcast by the BBC of the World Trade Center 7 Building collapsing,
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:44.800]  which it didn't at the time, they were reporting it, somewhere down the line, someone had to
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:46.960]  hand that reporter a script.
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:49.320]  And that script had to come from somewhere up above.
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:50.760]  Oh, no, we know where it came from.
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:55.560]  We first broke when they uploaded the archives of the BBC of their two channels, saying Building
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:56:00.560]  7 has fallen in its own footprint from fire 26 minutes before it fell, turned out seeing
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.400]  it in an hour before.
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:03.720]  And I predict it would be Reuters.
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:08.760]  I found out Reuters fed them their scripts, and they just jumped the gun with the cover
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.280]  story early.
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:13.160]  And then we even have cops saying, get back, they're going to blow it up.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:16.360]  And I'm not saying the cops were involved, they just were told, get back, they're going
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:17.360]  to blow it up.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.360]  And they did blow it up.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.600]  And it was CIA headquarters, I should add.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:25.520]  And so, yeah, no, I mean, they said they blew it up, but that's what they do.
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:29.080]  Down the chain, there had to have knowledge, and that is conspiracy.
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:32.560]  I'm not a policeman or anything, but it's a clear case of conspiracy, and there should
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:36.000]  be an easy trail to follow to where that information came from.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000]  Why hasn't that been done?
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.040]  I tried to get a hold of Greg Palast, and I thought maybe you could talk to Mike Zillow
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.280]  about it.
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:49.840]  Well listen, I've made three films that Building 7's in, and I have talked about it, and we've
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:54.840]  got YouTube videos with millions of views, people looking at it, and it's the third building
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:57:00.800]  that fell that day, and I was driving to get a pizza at like 425 Central, 525 Eastern when
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.920]  it supposedly fell, and I heard CBS Radio, back when they still had CBS Radio, I guess
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:09.280]  they still have it, but it was on local station, say that the decision's been made for the
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:13.680]  control demolition, and people heard it on NPR, and now all those tapes have been found,
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:17.040]  and when you bring it up, they go, no, that was never on the news, you're like, we have
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:21.800]  the video, and the BBC first said, no, that's not real video, then they admitted it was
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:26.640]  real video, then they said, yeah, we were told by Reuters it had fallen, so Reuters did
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:33.000]  that, and then even the owner of the building who bought it a few months before, and he's
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:38.480]  made like 8 billion, he wants billions more now for a $100 million investment, he has
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:43.600]  Larry Silverstein has come out, and said, well, we gave the order to pull it, and then
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.800]  watch the building come down, and then we have the same PBS documentary where they're
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:52.760]  blowing up the wreckage of the other building saying, getting ready to pull building 6,
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:58.800]  and then they blow it up, so yeah, they blow it up in front of everybody, kind of like
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:03.480]  the globalist stage, all this other stuff, and that's just the way it is, what do you
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.480]  think about that?
[01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:08.960]  Well, I guess I think there should be a way to follow the trail to find out where that
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:13.040]  information came from, Reuters who and Reuters did it, you know, there's got to be certain
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:15.320]  individuals that are responsible for this.
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:20.520]  Well, sir, I just suggest you take more vaccines and drink more fluoride water, and Snort depleted
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:23.680]  uranium because they say it's good for him being sarcastic, I mean I just think the government
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:28.840]  loves us, and you know, so what have they blow up building, so what if we had the emergency
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:34.800]  management deputy head on, saying they blew it up, and then two weeks later he died, and
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:40.040]  the family was threatened, I mean, everything's okay.

[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:33.800]  All right, we're going to get into a report on the FBI sweeping child prostitution rings
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:37.960]  up around the country, but putting the kids right back with the foster homes that we've
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:41.680]  seen over and over again are the ones pimping the kids out. And then you can pull up where
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:46.520]  there's thousands of missing kids per state CPS has had. I mean, it's just unbelievable
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:49.600]  because that's the type of people that want to be in control of the kids. I mean, that's
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:56.160]  just a fact. And unfortunately, the NSA grid isn't going to protect those children. These
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:59.640]  are kids that the government couldn't get aborted and couldn't sell their body parts
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:04.920]  for $10,000 a piece as we covered yesterday. And they're just upset. So they want to kill
[02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:09.880]  their soul as fast as possible. Let's talk to Frank in North Carolina. Frank, you're
[02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:11.120]  on the air. Welcome.
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:18.720]  Thanks, Alex. Good tool out there and out of the Hollywood pop, waking up, I think, young
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.360]  veterans in particular. I think you referenced the movie yesterday. I don't know if I've
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:29.440]  ever heard you reference it before, but I think you actually said that the name of
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:32.640]  the movie was the shooter, but it's shooter from 2007.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:36.480]  Yeah, Mark Wahlberg, we put it on screen. We put the IMDb up.
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.360]  Okay. Yeah, I didn't know if you'd critique that movie. I know you like to critique, you
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.440]  know, movies that put out a lot of truth in our fictional setting.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:46.560]  No, I need to do that. That's a good idea. You know, I tend to review films that are
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:50.800]  coming out or have just come out just because there's more interest in it. And then we can
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:02:00.480]  reach more people. But yeah, the film is absolutely anti-New World Order, shows a false flag,
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:04.480]  talks about the government killing Kennedy, talks about how the corporate combines work.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.880]  It's a really first rate film.
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:10.280]  First rate all the way and it gets out a lot of truth. Can I give a quick shout out to
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:14.120]  our local mainstream radio guy here? He's a big fan of yours. You can plug in your show
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:15.120]  for years.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:16.120]  Sure, great.
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:22.000]  Keith Larson and Charlotte, North Carolina at a 50,000 watt station, WBT 1110 AM. He's
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:26.200]  a big fan. He's been plugging it forward.com for years and he's a big fan of yours.
[02:02:26.200 --> 02:02:29.360]  Well, thank you. I'm a fan of all the folks out there fighting for freedom because we're
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:30.360]  in big trouble.
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:31.360]  All right, thanks.
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:37.240]  Thank you, Frank. Good to hear from you, brother. Bo in Virginia, you're on the air. Go ahead,
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:38.240]  Bo.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:44.120]  Yes, Alex. It's good to talk to you. I've finally been awake since about April of this
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:52.800]  year and I had a question about the Anonymous and if that is a CIA style or if it's real
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:55.520]  or what you can tell me about it.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.640]  Specifically, quantify that. What's your question? I'm sorry.
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:03.200]  About the Anonymous. I've seen them on YouTube.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:08.600]  Sure, sure. Anonymous could be anybody. I could go do a video and say it was Anonymous.
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:13.800]  Then it's a perfect cut out for government to do bad things and then say it's Anonymous.
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:20.080]  But Anonymous just means lone wolf. I'm doing something and not asking for credit for it.
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.400]  And so I think there's a lot of good people operating as Anonymous. There's also globalist
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:29.920]  doing bad things, trying to then false flag Anonymous. But as long as you're aware of
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:35.520]  the real code of real Anonymous, open information, liberty, freedom, justice, the things that
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:40.160]  Adam Schwartz stood for, it was really part of Anonymous and they murdered him and they
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:44.360]  came and killed him because he was fighting him and exposing him and helped kill Syspa
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:50.040]  and some of the other internet freedom killing things.
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:57.160]  So I overall support Anonymous, but I support actions of Anonymous. It should be called individual
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:04:03.920]  Anonymous because it really means individual, lone wolf individual. I support the ethical
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:11.360]  operations of Anonymous, but Anonymous is inherently diversified and is inherently individuals.
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:13.720]  So it's not one group. Do you see what I'm saying?
[02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:21.040]  Yes. Yes, I understand. Okay, I have one more little point I need to make with you. I was
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:29.800]  born with Huntington's disease and of course, it's a malformed chromosome in the brain and
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:37.000]  as you get older, you kind of imagine, you see things and with this disease, I'm having
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.480]  a very, very hard time getting the word out because they all think I'm losing my mind.
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:46.840]  That sounds kind of like for people pay to get drugs to be able to do that. I'm not being
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:51.360]  sarcastic, but kind of make a lemonade with the lemons. What kind of stuff do you see?
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:57.960]  Well, it's just started on me. It always is in our family and males. It starts about
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:01.040]  the same. Hold on. Hold on. We'll come back to you. Introduce.

[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:29.560]  All right, we are going to continue with your phone calls. David Knight is coming up to
[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:36.080]  announce the first place winner in the $115,000 film contest Operation Paul Revere and Incredible
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:37.080]  Success.
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:40.960]  I want to salute all of you that were involved. We've got a lot of other economic news and
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:48.840]  new emails showing the FEC IRS targeting conservative groups, real libertarian constitutional
[02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:53.800]  groups like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. Every day when I watch C-SPAN, I'm now seeing Rand
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:58.000]  Paul and they're battling the globalist, battling our government funding al-Qaeda. I was just
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:02.440]  watching that earlier during a break. He's been on for hours giving a speech. It's got
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:05.840]  to be hours. He's walking by and it's still Rand Paul in there. I'm going to get him back
[02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:11.360]  on the show and his dad as well. The whole point is that there are good people out there.
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:15.160]  I know Rand Paul. I know he's good. I can't tell you how good it is to know he's bucking
[02:09:15.160 --> 02:09:20.440]  the whole system. He's got the neocons, the mainline Republicans, the liberals, the socialists,
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:25.920]  the commies, the foreign banks coming after him. But still, he gets more and more popular.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:28.920]  Again, we can turn the tide against this insanity.
[02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:33.280]  Now, speaking of turning the tide, I happen to know there are a lot of good FBI agents
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:38.760]  and a lot of good DEA agents and a lot of good federal marshals and a lot of good people
[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:42.040]  because they've given me a lot of breaking news that's been national news as you know
[02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:48.480]  over the years, just bombshell stuff, Navy Seals, you name it. But compartmentalization
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:55.760]  is the word that everybody needs to understand. You can have 90% of people being good in an
[02:09:55.760 --> 02:10:01.360]  organization, 95% generally, but it's those top people just like in a corporation. It's
[02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:06.040]  the CEO or the comp troll that's doing the fraud. It's called controller fraud. The people
[02:10:06.040 --> 02:10:10.320]  that are at that nexus of a bunch of different info and different departments, they're the
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:15.760]  ones and that's where you find the hardcore money laundering, the drug dealing, you name
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:21.360]  it, but it's not just that. Every vice tends to get run by the alpha criminals and last
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:26.080]  hour I covered BBC and the Hollywood Reporter, how the British government worked to get Nazi
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:30.080]  gold out. Of course, they got pieces of it. I don't think they brought over 10,000 Nazis
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:34.840]  to England after the war and put them in top positions and 30 plus thousand of the US because
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.760]  they had all the stolen loot of like eight different or more European countries. I mean,
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:45.640]  they had just just caves full of art and gold and diamonds and rubies and just just thousands
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:50.600]  of years of loot that they had stolen in those few short years that have been hoarded up
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:55.360]  in Europe. They even double crossed the Rothschilds and killed a bunch of them in France and stole
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:59.520]  their goodies. So it's in the news today that the British government worked with them. Of
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:03.080]  course they did because they knew where all the treasure was buried and then the Hollywood
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:07.720]  Reporter comes out the chilling history of how Hollywood helped Hitler. Well, yeah, Hitler
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:14.080]  was on the cover of Time Magazine when a great guy was twice. My grandfather and his, his
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:17.600]  dad, you know, they were German. They spoke German, been here in Texas since it started,
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:22.680]  but they can still speak German, a lot of German communities here. They would play on
[02:11:22.680 --> 02:11:30.120]  the main channels in German. Hitler's speeches on the English channels and my grandfather's
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:34.760]  dad was freaked out by it because he was a smart guy and they knew the German community
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:39.600]  who in the buildup to World War Two in Dallas and in Austin was having money sucked out
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:43.360]  of them, threatening to kill their families in Germany. They didn't. These were Germans.
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:47.840]  These weren't Jews folks. They were going after everybody. So I know Hitler was bad
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:54.000]  because I was told about it by my grandfather. Okay, William Hammond. Now continuing here,
[02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.800]  ladies and gentlemen, that's how evil our government was back then or elements of it.
[02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:02.880]  Press got Bush and others on record part of it running. And that's where all the bushes
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:06.680]  got their original money and came from nowhere to Senator and all the rest of it. He was the
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:12.720]  head of the Brown Brother Harriman and got a lot of the loot went through him to Argentina
[02:12:12.720 --> 02:12:18.080]  and places like that. Now, expanding on this and I'm not even seeing one of the bushes
[02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:22.360]  out. I mean, it was like Hitler was a rock star folks for seven years here in the U.S.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:26.960]  I mean, he was on the cover of, you know, gardening magazines and vegetarian magazines
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:33.440]  and dog fancy magazines. Now, imagine how corrupt we are today. Dinkor, Halliburton have all
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:36.400]  been caught running child sex slave rings. We're going to show you mainstream news articles
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:40.600]  in a moment. We've got all this stuff going on. So I see an article on Monday. We mentioned
[02:12:40.600 --> 02:12:45.800]  it, but I wanted to get back into it nationwide. Child prostitution sweep rescues 105 kids
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:50.480]  arrest 150 pimps from 70 cities, including Atlantic City. And let's show some of these
[02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:54.440]  degenerate pimps. Let's type in pimps in a child prostitution rate. I want to show
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:59.320]  some of these scumbags on screen. But the point is, is that the FBI talks about what
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:02.640]  a great job they're doing. And I'm sure these units that were allowed to go after these
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:07.280]  guys, you know, have done a good job. But I've analyzed that these are lower level kind
[02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:13.320]  of retail pimps with these child sex slaves, but they came out of foster care in Houston,
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:17.040]  you name it. And they went right back to those. And then we have the reports where a lot of
[02:13:17.040 --> 02:13:21.680]  those foster care things are admitted to have child molesters in them. Who do you think
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:26.800]  gets into all this stuff? And so I just want people to know the rest of the story, three
[02:13:26.800 --> 02:13:33.360]  day FBI raid rescues 105 children from prostitution and 150 arrested. And then we're going to
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:37.240]  get Leanne McAdoo in this segment, the next, then we'll go to your calls and have David
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:40.880]  Knight in here break down. Cause I had her just go pull up some of the other news on
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:44.800]  this today. There's literally thousands of articles. Leanne McAdoo, infowars, not only
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:50.560]  news reporter, tell folks about what you've discovered digging into this case.
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:56.360]  Right. Well, a lot of the articles really did not highlight the vulnerability of foster
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:02.720]  children in the sex trafficking sting that took place. 60% of the runaways who are victims
[02:14:02.720 --> 02:14:09.280]  of sex trafficking were in the custody of social services. So it's a lot like the girl
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:14.800]  here that, um, in Austin, just that was raped by the 13 illegal aliens. Just this a few
[02:14:14.800 --> 02:14:20.640]  weeks ago, she was in custody of social services. So, and then they just took her and put her
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:26.760]  right back because, you know, these are, are these children, they don't have families necessarily
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:31.120]  that are, you know, reporting them missing. Uh, they're, they're vulnerable. So these
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:35.160]  are the targets. And so the police, they, the FBI, they rescue them, but then where
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:41.080]  do they put them? They put them exactly back in the system that, you know, basically sets
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:46.000]  these kids up here. I have a report that, uh, an audit found that sex offenders were
[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:52.320]  living and working in foster care homes. The addresses of more than a thousand registered
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:57.680]  sex offenders match the addresses of licensed foster care facilities in homes. Absolutely.
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:02.080]  That's a Sacramento B. I remember about seven years ago, it came out that over 3000 children
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:07.360]  were missing in Florida from foster care and some were found dead in snuff film operations,
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.400]  even CNN reported on this. And then suddenly it got shut down and it turned out the director
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:17.200]  of Florida and his top three underlings were actually convicted child rapist. And then
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:22.200]  I found out most the Texas youth commission, same deal. The truth is a cult of child predators
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:27.360]  has pretty much, it's not just the Catholic church folks. They've taken everything over.
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:31.040]  They've taken, I mean, it's all over the place and people need to understand it's not just
[02:15:31.040 --> 02:15:34.680]  the Catholic church. And I'm not Catholic and I'm not defending the Catholic church.
[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:39.920]  I found statistically it's even worse in government. Oh yeah. I mean, but no one wants to talk
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:46.680]  about that. Oh yeah. Well, you have the DineCourt and, uh, you and peacekeepers who are involved.
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:50.360]  There's the, you've got mainstream articles on that. Exactly. The Franklin scandal, which
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:55.800]  was the nationwide pedophile ring, Republican party. Exactly. There were two Republican
[02:15:55.800 --> 02:16:02.880]  power brokers who use the boy town, uh, organization as kind of like a pedophilic reservoir to
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:08.840]  and, and, and I had John DeCamp and others who blew the whistle on that on years before
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:14.400]  and he said, Oh, the big nest is at Penn state on record. It freaked out the media. Years
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:18.240]  later it came out. They knew about that. Cause by the way, Sandusky was selling the
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:23.480]  kids to everybody. That's why he was raping children at noon on a Monday in the field
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:27.680]  house. I mean, that's like an aircraft carrier at noon. I mean, I played football. It's just
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:31.960]  people are in there 24 seven in the middle of the day. They were publicly raping children.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:36.480]  Again, they do whatever they want. Right. It's like, uh, in England, all these BBC guys
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:41.140]  are getting caught with kids. Exactly. And the, the, here's a report from the United
[02:16:41.140 --> 02:16:47.400]  Nations office on drugs and crime. And there is a whole, um, basically just a whole thing
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:52.000]  about the opportunities for corruption and trafficking in persons. And the, where they're
[02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:58.560]  really drawing it where it starts is the corrupt actors are police, customs officers, border
[02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:05.000]  control authorities, uh, government officials, parliamentarians. So they know it's, it's
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:11.680]  the, yeah, let me show viewers on document cam, uh, this actual, uh, UNO DC United Nations
[02:17:11.680 --> 02:17:15.280]  office of drugs and crime. And it's funny cause they're the worst that they're the
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:19.400]  main movers. Well, diplomatic community. And then they report on themselves and get more
[02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:25.120]  power countering themselves when the UN aircraft land, I mean, anywhere, they don't just rape
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:30.680]  the kids. You can type in UN peacekeepers, roast children and eat them. I'm not joking.
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:37.800]  It will show them roasting 10 year old boys on spits. They eat them. You don't get, in
[02:17:37.800 --> 02:17:41.480]  fact, you've got the reports where men and women in the UN peacekeepers get kicked out
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:44.680]  because they won't be part of it. You've got the whistleblower info right there. Right.
[02:17:44.680 --> 02:17:49.360]  Exactly. I mean, and I'm saying this listeners, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm, I'm actually,
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:54.600]  this is real. Right. It's right here. It says organized trafficking requires systemic
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:59.600]  corruption. Corruption is central to the success of traffickers and therefore criminals considered
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:06.480]  a necessary investment. So they're bribing politicians, policemen, and they're getting,
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:11.640]  they're getting to use the goods, so to speak. So they cover it up and then they go in and
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:18.280]  get the little boys and little girls and the women and just turn, turn a blind eye.
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:21.200]  You're absolutely right. And it's totally disgusting. We're going to go to break and
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:24.880]  come back and play a clip from a congressional hearing back when Cynthia McKinney was still
[02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:29.120]  there where she brings up Dinecore running kidnapped women and children. And he doesn't
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:32.640]  deny it. It's a real case, but then he says they didn't get in trouble.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:35.320]  Right. And then boy, they went after her after they
[02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:37.120]  say what you want about that lady. She has courage.
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:42.000]  Oh yeah. Oh my gosh. I was loving watching that clip of her. And I have the last clip
[02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:47.960]  of Rumsfeld face. He's just like, and then he gets, then they get into the Norad stand
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:52.120]  down. They admit that. Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's like an hour long grilling, grilling
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:53.120]  them.
[02:18:53.120 --> 02:18:57.720]  They've got some Dr. Evil guy. He goes, Dr. Chew is the head auditor. What's going on
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:02.040]  with that? And he's, and they're like, we will not discuss it. It's like a bad guy from
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:06.240]  a James Bond movie. I mean, it is just like, well, Dr. Chew says
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:11.920]  Dr. Chew says, that's just because the guy looks like the bad guy and Dr. No. I mean,
[02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:15.920]  it's like, you expect you to have like underground bases with nuclear reactors. I guess he does.
[02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:20.040]  I mean, it's like, it's like Dr. Evil, man, but we joke about it. And then they talk about
[02:19:20.040 --> 02:19:24.120]  deadly vaccines killing people and they're not denying any of it. Well, yes, they do
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:27.640]  run John child kidnapping rings, but we're not going to do anything to them. Yes, we
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:30.840]  do kill people that, you know, it's just like, right, that was actually the, when McKinney
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:34.560]  was grilling him, she's like, well, Dinecore is now creating these vaccines and they're
[02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:39.320]  also, you know, so why are they continuing to be given these? They're they're known criminals
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:43.040]  and he's like, well, I'll just have to look into that. I was, well, they were in the penalty
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:47.560]  box for one year and she's like, no, they weren't the penalty boxes. They don't get
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:51.840]  more contracts for kids. And the whistleblowers said they pull up and there's like babies
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:56.440]  and two year olds being loaded on C 130s to be taken to have their brains blown out on
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:20:02.920]  camera. I mean, it's just like snuff filming children to thank you for being a loyal listener.

[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:36.640]  Alright we only got a six minute segment here and we're going to finish up with this. We'll
[02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:40.560]  be more on the nightly news the next few nights. David Knight's doing a big report on this.
[02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:43.440]  And folks you talk about the hair on the back of your neck standing up especially if you
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:46.880]  have children. You got to understand when they're like busting people or saying there's
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:50.920]  child porn or somebody downloaded it. That's just a few people to make it look like they're
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:55.360]  doing something or when good people in the police departments are able to go out and
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:25:00.400]  actually stop them. But overall the high level operators are being protected and again you
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:05.680]  have mainstream news, Sacramento B, AP, UN's own reports. Read that part about the small
[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:09.880]  children being most prized because they can rape them over and over again and then sell
[02:25:09.880 --> 02:25:14.880]  them to other people or sell them to non-suspecting people for adoption. Not knowing they're
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:19.560]  getting some four year old that's been brutally raped 150 times. Exactly. This one is from
[02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:24.480]  the Vanguard's Global Center for Women and Justice. They say human trafficking is a business
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:29.080]  that is far more lucrative in the sale of drugs or arms because the children involved
[02:25:29.080 --> 02:25:36.080]  are considered reusable assets. And so this is just something that you know people will
[02:25:36.080 --> 02:25:43.240]  take these kids. They can a Texas couple for $30 a month. They had over 70,000 people
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:49.840]  that signed up to watch them take pornographic pictures. And see people like that where it's
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:54.640]  100% proven need to be killed. Exactly. And my whole issue is if you're in government
[02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:57.720]  or wherever and this stuff's going on and nothing will be done, it's time to take the
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:01.520]  law into your own hands. I mean it's time to start protecting these children and I'm
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:04.520]  sorry. I see somebody abusing a child with a cops won't do anything. I'm going to beat
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:09.200]  your brains out. Okay? So I mean I'm just, I'm not trying to talk tough. People are
[02:26:09.200 --> 02:26:12.720]  just putting up with this crap and I've had enough of it. Someone's got to protect them
[02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:17.160]  and that's why I really appreciated McKinney when she took Rumsfeld to task because here
[02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:23.200]  are people they're they're known buying little children, little children and they're you
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:29.320]  know government contractors. But there are troops saving us. Here let's go to that clip.
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:36.440]  This is the clip with Cynthia McKinney. Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush deliver
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:43.240]  a moving speech in Congress seven years ago, September 2003, in which he mentioned he mentioned
[02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:48.600]  the crisis of the sex trade. The president called for the punishment of those involved
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:54.840]  in this horrible business. But at the very moment of that speech, Dinecore was exposed
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:27:00.040]  for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children. While
[02:27:00.040 --> 02:27:05.160]  all of this was going on, Dinecore kept the Pentagon contract to administer the small
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:09.440]  pots and anthrax vaccines. That killed a bunch of people too. It is now working on a plague
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:15.320]  vaccine. Every day they do kill people. It's just like saying. Mr. Secretary, is it policy
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:22.040]  of the US government to reward companies that traffic and women and little girls? Thank
[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:30.040]  you, Representative. The answer to your first question is no, absolutely not. The policy
[02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:38.400]  of the United States government is clear, unambiguous and opposed to the activities
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:47.480]  that you described. The second question. How do you explain the fact that Dinecore and
[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:54.600]  its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:28:00.800]  I would have to go and find the facts, but there are laws and rules and regulations with
[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:05.640]  respect to government contracts. And there are times that corporations do things they
[02:28:05.640 --> 02:28:10.480]  should not do, in which case they tend to be suspended for some period. There are times
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:16.600]  then that under the laws and the rules and regulations passed by the Congress and implemented
[02:28:16.600 --> 02:28:22.720]  by the executive branch, that corporations can get off of the out of the penalty box,
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:29.520]  if you will, and be permitted to engage in contracts with the government. They're generally
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:36.720]  not barred in perpetuity. This company was never in the penalty box. If you could proceed
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:41.280]  to my second question, please. On your first question, I'm advised by Dr.
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:46.120]  Chu that it was not the corporation that was engaged in the activities you characterized,
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:51.560]  but I'm told it was an employee of the corporation. And it was some years ago in the Balkans
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:54.640]  that that took place. It's my understanding that that continues
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:58.800]  to take place. Is that right? Yes, but you can give me information
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:01.200]  to that effect. I'm sure you are interested in all of the
[02:29:01.200 --> 02:29:04.120]  information that I have, and I'll be more than happy to provide it to you.
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:06.680]  Good, thank you. But I would also like to get information
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:11.280]  from you. For example, the information that I just requested about who it is.
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:14.640]  That's good. The full interview, stop in, Cynthia McKinney, Grylls-Rumsfeld, it's all
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:21.920]  over YouTube, but I mean, it's on thousands of articles, BBC, AP, just that company, others,
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.000]  women, children, huge amounts, children that ended up dead, you name it, and then just
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.680]  look how they all likely, they don't know anything about it.
[02:29:27.680 --> 02:29:32.560]  Well, that's one of the most profitable things. Leigh Ann, I want to stay on this story and
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:35.040]  just keep hammering this issue. Good job. Thank you.
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:39.040]  Well, there I'd back, ladies and gentlemen, with David Knight and the winner of the Paul

[02:33:56.160 --> 02:34:02.060]  to get to a couple of the other runners up or honorable mention films from the Info
[02:34:02.060 --> 02:34:08.280]  Wars.com Paul Revere contest with David Knight. And we will conclude the contest today with
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:12.840]  the $100,000 winner. But I'll also going to get the second place winner on the night.
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:16.520]  And then sometime this week tomorrow or Friday, we'll try to get on the first place winner
[02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:23.200]  that we're going to announce here in just a few minutes. But I just cannot stress enough
[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:27.360]  how exciting this is. So we're going to be talking about that in just a moment. First
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:32.760]  off, ladies and gentlemen, so much of the poison that our bodies build up is in the
[02:34:32.760 --> 02:34:38.800]  water table, the pesticides, the herbicides, the chemicals, the garbage, the things they
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:44.680]  add, the hydrofluorosilic, sodium fluoride, the mercury, the lead, the arsenic, all of
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:51.840]  it. And then the runoff from all the drugs people are taking in the sewage and the chemtrail,
[02:34:51.840 --> 02:34:55.440]  barium, salts, aluminum dioxide, all this stuff is in the water table. Even if you're
[02:34:55.440 --> 02:34:59.160]  on a well, you should have the water tested, there's usually some issues. And I'm on well
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:04.600]  water myself and I have rainwater, but I still put it through a pro-pure stainless steel
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:10.720]  system. We also have a reverse osmosis sometimes my wife's cooking and I don't want to dump
[02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:16.720]  the well water into the pro-pure. And they have the pro one that even cuts out the fluoride.
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:22.320]  Most systems can't do that. And the hydrofluorosilic acid and several other things I can't pronounce.
[02:35:22.320 --> 02:35:26.240]  The point is it is the very best system. I went out for years, researched because I wasn't
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:29.840]  happy with the other gravity-fed filters. The quality went down or they were hard to
[02:35:29.840 --> 02:35:34.040]  get or they were hard for availability or I didn't like it being shipped in from China
[02:35:34.040 --> 02:35:39.520]  on and on and on. So I went out, spent several years, used pro-pure, looked at the studies
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:42.980]  and have been promoting them the last few years. So you notice we didn't sell filters
[02:35:42.980 --> 02:35:46.600]  for a couple of years because I just couldn't find anything. Now I found pro-pure and several
[02:35:46.600 --> 02:35:50.960]  other brands that we really think are great and the life straw for emergencies and out
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:57.520]  in the field. So whatever you see in infowars store is one word. Infowarsstore.com are the
[02:35:57.520 --> 02:36:02.320]  very best filtration system starting with pro one and the pro-pure system. Look at the

[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:57.360]  that they're going to be getting into their bodies, reducing that toxic load, increasing
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:02.080]  lifespan health, you name it. Undoubtedly clean water is essential to civilization and
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:06.800]  the globalist has cast Sunstein and well the head of science are. John P. Holdren said

[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:29.240]  to take the funds that come in here and pour it into resistance. That's my dream. Some
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:33.240]  guys are into cars, which I don't blame. I like cars too. Some people are into, you
[02:37:33.240 --> 02:37:37.480]  know, having a good time, travel, whatever. I'm into liberty. Some people are into status.
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:42.640]  I'm not into that. I'm into fighting globalist scum. I take it personally. I hate them. I
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:46.120]  have dreams about defeating the new world order. You know, I eat, drink and sleep this.
[02:37:46.120 --> 02:37:50.560]  And so please give me the power financially to throw everything I've got against them.
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:54.880]  Doesn't mean here at Infowars we'll defeat them, but together with that spirit and spreading
[02:37:54.880 --> 02:38:00.160]  that spirit of liberty, we will. So please financially support us. Become a PrisonPlanet.tv

[02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:19.680]  going to happen by you taking action. I know many of you have. So I salute you.
[02:38:19.680 --> 02:38:25.640]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, the big announcement is here and David Knight was actually pretty
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:30.280]  excited coming in here. One of our info wars reporters and he's also helped us out with
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:35.960]  administrative stuff trying to organize the site info wars.com for slash Paul Revere or
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:42.920]  just Paul will get you there and the top 35 in the top three. Now we've given you the
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:49.720]  third place and second place a political earth was third place and then American drone was
[02:38:49.720 --> 02:38:55.880]  second place. And in a few minutes, we're going to give you the first place winner.
[02:38:55.880 --> 02:38:59.320]  And I wonder if people can guess what this is going to be. Actually, a lot of people
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:05.640]  have guessed because I think it's clearly the first or second entry. And again, the
[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:11.800]  top 10 or so were so close. It was all just fractions of who's going to win and also remember
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.360]  people that win this $100,000 for taxes will be like 70. The point is then they're obviously
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:23.080]  going to be able to go do that and make more films. So let's go to David Knight. David,
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:26.320]  this is a momentous moment we're about to get to. But first off, we've got a few of the
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:32.240]  other honorable mentions here. Tell us about those and then the drum roll for the winner.
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:35.720]  You know, Alex, the whole purpose of this contest is you wanted to put some of the money
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:39.440]  that you've made out there and try to encourage people to get active and involved because
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:42.840]  in the 21st century, you're not going to change people's minds by handing out literature
[02:39:42.840 --> 02:39:47.160]  tracks. It doesn't work that way. How did you learn about me through documentaries
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:50.240]  and then found you on the radio? And even though we didn't get radio, we got you on
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:56.040]  the iPhone app and we're able to stream that. But we want people to learn how to communicate
[02:39:56.040 --> 02:39:59.920]  more effectively in a 21st century manner. And so the very first entry that we're going
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:05.720]  to be highlighting today is a healthy distrust. This is from Mike Adamski. And this is what
[02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:09.840]  he said, I'm just one guy with a camera and a passion to resist tyranny at all costs while
[02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:14.360]  already working more than 40 plus hours a week at multiple jobs. I found time to travel
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:19.400]  from Springfield, Massachusetts to Boston, to King, New Hampshire, Philadelphia and Washington
[02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:24.560]  D.C. And I found like-minded individuals all over the place. And again, they all win by
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:30.200]  the passionate exercise of liberty. And we've had incredible feedback. People have been
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:34.240]  so positive. Almost all of them have been great sports. A few people are real mad they
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:38.640]  haven't won. And clearly they didn't have the best films. So why enter a contest? It's
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:43.280]  about you're in the arena. Or do they go political or didn't have info wars at the start? Well,
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:47.520]  our copy we uploaded, you're not, you're not, you're bad, but you know, that's my mistake.
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:52.400]  Well, but you're doing the work, but on their side, it does have info wars. But the contest
[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:56.120]  says, I can give it to whoever I want. Right. Try to follow these guidelines. But people
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:00.120]  are just some of them. I'm really sad for them. Yeah. And, and you know, we saw this
[02:41:00.120 --> 02:41:04.520]  also in another entry. It was becoming Paul Revere. These are a bunch of guys who met up
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:08.160]  during the reporter contest. They didn't win the reporter contest, but they were in different
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:13.240]  areas all over the country. They linked together and created this online news organization,
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:16.920]  the media speaks, and they did a documentary about how they came together based on the
[02:41:16.920 --> 02:41:21.440]  reporter contest. So these types of things, these types of relationships, this type of
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:27.680]  growth is what we're looking for. Let's take a look at what Micodansky did in his spare
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:31.480]  time quote unquote, after he's working more than 40 hours a week. And this is the healthy
[02:41:31.480 --> 02:41:38.880]  distrust. Yes. Here it is. Right. We're not going to have any rights. The federal government's
[02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:45.160]  onslaught on our personal civil liberties and civil rights is absolutely a bipartisan
[02:41:45.160 --> 02:41:52.320]  affair. There is complete continuity from the Bush administration to the Obama administration.
[02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:55.320]  That sounds like a crazy conspiracy theory to me. I don't know. Meanwhile, there are
[02:41:55.320 --> 02:41:59.280]  new disturbing developments out of Washington tonight regarding the president's belief
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:03.800]  that he has the legal authority to assassinate US citizens. Three Americans now have been
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:07.520]  on the list. They've been assassinated, but they don't talk about the second one because
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:12.480]  the second one happened to be a 16 year old son of a locket. You're not even to acknowledge
[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:17.840]  the drone program. You're not even to discuss that it exists. You know what? As long as
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:22.480]  it's our team that's in office, I feel a little more secure than if it's the Republicans
[02:42:22.480 --> 02:42:27.880]  in office. The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:42:27.880 --> 02:42:35.200]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition. Staggering pile of 1.6 billion
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:42.600]  rounds. The time has come, America, to step up and ban these weapons. We will not disarm.
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:49.600]  We will not comply, and we will resist. 1776 will commence again if you try to take our
[02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:53.400]  firearms. Doesn't matter how many lemons you get out there on the street. All right, so
[02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:56.640]  that's a healthy distrust. I think it's like 19 minutes long. It's just a short minute
[02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:02.560]  and a half clip. Very powerful. Let's talk about a New World Order, United We Stand,
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:06.560]  which probably would have been the winner, maybe if he had been in the top two or three,
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:07.560]  but got it in late.
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:10.800]  That's right. He didn't get that in until June 23rd. So we wanted to put this on the
[02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:16.080]  website because it's a great piece of work. This is a guy, Tom Antos, and he does tutorials
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:20.680]  on YouTube. So for all you people who entered, we hope, number one, that you're going to
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:25.040]  hook up with other people that have a complimentary skill set. Nobody has all the skills.
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:26.800]  This is a networking thing for liberty.
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:28.800]  Exactly. So we want you to collaborate with the people.
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:29.800]  Not just for us.
[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:34.840]  You want to get your game up in terms of how to shoot and how to do camera flyovers. Look
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:39.880]  at this guy's tutorials, Tom Antos. And his film is New World Order, United We Stand.
[02:43:39.880 --> 02:43:44.120]  And I'll just give you a little bit of introduction. It says it's 2018 and Earth is under attack.
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:47.000]  Nuclear weapons devastate several developing countries. Weaker governments look to the
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:51.400]  U.S. to take on world military leadership. Soon Russia and other powers consider joining
[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:52.400]  the alliance.
[02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:56.040]  In humanity's darkest moments, the dreams of a United World seem to be finally coming
[02:43:56.040 --> 02:44:01.400]  true. What will it take to unite the world government? And here's his short film, part
[02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:03.400]  of it, just a couple of minutes.
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:07.400]  Michigan, USA, year 2018.
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:16.240]  When a war is waged, the question most often asked is why. And we find plenty of reasons
[02:44:16.240 --> 02:44:23.920]  whether they're real or not. But perhaps the question we should be asking is not why,
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:30.200]  but who.
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:31.200]  The Loving Drone.
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:37.320]  He's got some great special effects. You've got to see this, please, James.
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:44.880]  And he actually recovered mission underway. We are Oscar Mike. He actually launched his
[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:45.880]  own little drone.
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:50.560]  To understand this war, we have to go back. Further than any of us could have anticipated.
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:45:02.560]  That's troops hunting down militias. You've got to go see it. New Oriana, we stand. It's
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:03.560]  on infowords.com.
[02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:12.080]  My living, as tragic as it was, brought about the unwavering unity of the American people.
[02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:14.160]  But what would it take to unite the entire world?
[02:45:14.160 --> 02:45:16.080]  He did that shot with his own little drone.
[02:45:16.080 --> 02:45:23.520]  Perhaps we need some outside universal threat. If suddenly there was a threat to this world
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:29.920]  from some other species from another planet outside in the universe.
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:31.640]  That's Project Bluebeam.
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:39.280]  I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:42.080]  alien threat from outside this world.
[02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:43.960]  We are. It's called the New World Order.
[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:50.960]  And yet, I ask you, is not an alien force already amongst us?
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:54.160]  United, we stand. New World Order.
[02:45:54.160 --> 02:45:58.800]  Yeah. The production values there look like something out of Hollywood. But this is stuff
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:01.160]  that you can do as an indie filmmaker.
[02:46:01.160 --> 02:46:04.480]  And he actually runs these free online tutorials. What a great guy. He's showing people how
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:05.800]  to do it. What an amazing person.
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:10.440]  Fine work from Tom Antos. This next one is from a comedy group called Joy Camp. And this
[02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:12.960]  is a quick commercial spoof of big pharma commercials.
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:16.240]  And they were almost third place or second place. And we definitely want to work with
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:20.840]  them. They're great people. But it's just so hard to choose. But they're definitely
[02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:21.840]  a runner up.
[02:46:21.840 --> 02:46:26.280]  So this is a big pharma type commercial parody for an RFID chip.
[02:46:26.280 --> 02:46:29.120]  Let's go ahead and go to that.
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:32.120]  To think something so small could control you.
[02:46:32.120 --> 02:46:33.120]  A pill.
[02:46:33.120 --> 02:46:34.120]  And everything you do.
[02:46:34.120 --> 02:46:35.120]  Looks like a pill.
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:36.120]  And they've now come out with pills that actually do this.
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:37.120]  Yeah.
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:38.120]  That are RFID.
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:44.640]  They're on the line. The RFID chip is always with you. Threatening your privacy. Causing
[02:46:44.640 --> 02:46:49.320]  severe risk to your health and personal safety. And killing you if you do not obey rogue government
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:51.920]  demands.
[02:46:51.920 --> 02:46:56.560]  Because I want to increase my risk of cancer.
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:47:02.400]  Because I want to live in a cash free society.
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:07.720]  Because now the government is looking out for us.
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:12.360]  Because I have the mark of the beast. But it doesn't have me.
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:14.560]  Oh trendy.
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:18.760]  Ask your doctor how to get your chip implanted today.
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:21.560]  By CIA.
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:25.480]  Because we want to track your every move.
[02:47:25.480 --> 02:47:30.200]  And again in the piece they submitted there's like five or six each one amazing. And I just
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:33.640]  wish I had money to make them the you know the winner. But I definitely want to try to
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:37.480]  work with those guys. And I've already been for years a fan of just the I don't know fifty
[02:47:37.480 --> 02:47:42.320]  sixty I don't know scores of films they've made that are just amazing. And quite frankly
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:45.840]  some of the films they've made probably would have been first place but they made them before.
[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:50.240]  So just I mean definitely a talented talented crew of filmmakers.
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:51.240]  That's right.
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:53.120]  Now this this is the winner coming up.
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:55.040]  Hold on we're going to break before we do this.
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:56.040]  All right.
[02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:58.120]  I mean I'm not trying to build it up. I just don't think we're going to have time to get
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:47:59.120]  to it.
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:02.080]  You know what let's just not make them wait. Let's just go ahead and give it to them now.
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:05.560]  Well we can tell a little bit about why why we picked what we did and what we were trying
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:10.760]  to do in the contest. Which is to try to get people to use different types of techniques.
[02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:15.400]  We've done documentaries. We do news broadcasts. We do magazines. We're trying to hit an every
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:19.960]  type of medium to to get to the public to wake people up. Some people are going to wake
[02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:23.360]  up from one type of thing. Many people are going to wake up from another type of thing.
[02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:28.080]  And also there's different ways to present the information even if you go to a video
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:29.560]  or to a movie.
[02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:35.400]  So we wanted people to act things out and I think this grand prize winner is really shows
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:41.560]  that it we've told people about what's happening with this and with this situation. I'm still
[02:48:41.560 --> 02:48:46.560]  trying to keep it vague because I've announced it after the break right. But we want it.
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:51.520]  It's very powerful when you see people actually acting out what we've been telling people
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:53.760]  is happening inside the government.
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:59.000]  And what's crazy is is that so much of it is accurate to what they're really doing.
[02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.600]  And you know they kind of quantified at one point saying then they're going to use the
[02:49:01.600 --> 02:49:06.200]  robots to get rid of us. I mean maybe they should have said you know hindsight 20 20
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:10.720]  then they're bringing in the autonomous drones and systems to take humans out of the decision
[02:49:10.720 --> 02:49:11.720]  making process.
[02:49:11.720 --> 02:49:12.720]  Right.
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:18.240]  But again we're talking about who we want to work with in the future also for the production
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:23.640]  quality all of it the message the gutsiness of it because people see this and it shows
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:28.040]  feds being killed. But they're not feds. They're they're foreign globalist and they use the
[02:49:28.040 --> 02:49:32.520]  art type you know of a German. I'm starting to give it away here. They don't know who
[02:49:32.520 --> 02:49:33.520]  the winner is.
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:34.520]  We'll tell everybody when we come back.
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:35.520]  Exactly.
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:36.520]  We come back. Yeah.
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:37.520]  All right.
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:40.080]  But well most people probably weren't tuned in that day so most people probably don't
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:44.080]  know who the winner is. People say oh that's the archetypal bad guy. But that's meant
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:49.440]  designed to get to the general public to say the country's been hijacked. We can get Russians
[02:49:49.440 --> 02:49:54.800]  taken over the Nazis taken over. We don't get bankers corporate takeover. And that's
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:58.640]  happened to the government and everything else the film is really going on. They really
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:02.360]  have paper targets of kids are trying to shoot and old ladies and women and showers and old
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:07.520]  men and veterans and John Deere you know farmers. They they they really are bad mounting the
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:10.960]  founding fathers. They really are preparing a purge list. That's come out officially.
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:11.960]  Absolutely.
[02:50:11.960 --> 02:50:16.000]  And it just shows they're trying to normalize this evil and just everybody go with it like
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:21.720]  yeah the CIA's involved and we're doing counterinsurgency brainwashing and all the agencies are you
[02:50:21.720 --> 02:50:25.320]  know going to take over now and we are going to have checkpoints and we're just supposed
[02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:31.320]  to go oh so when you tell people this that's one thing but when they see it acted out when
[02:50:31.320 --> 02:50:35.400]  they see it visually they're part of it. That's a very powerful thing. So that's why with
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:40.080]  this film contest we wanted to people to not only do documentaries but to try to do action
[02:50:40.080 --> 02:50:41.600]  and dramas and that sort of thing.
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:47.040]  The $100,000 winner on the other side of this break and I love being able to do stuff like
[02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:51.960]  this ladies and gentlemen. And don't be in via some of you out there somebody that won

[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:42.920]  Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater
[02:52:42.920 --> 02:52:46.240]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army. Ted Anderson, I'm placing

[02:54:04.800 --> 02:54:09.840]  By the way, Don Salazar's done it really funny. He's going to have some line hearted stuff.
[02:54:09.840 --> 02:54:14.800]  Top 20 jokes about Wiener Gate. I took him about two days to put it together. It's Wiener
[02:54:14.800 --> 02:54:20.000]  stands up despite criticism, ladies and gentlemen. It's got all the jokes, all the late night
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:23.960]  jokes, all of it. It's important to laugh at this scumbag because he arrogantly thinks
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:31.520]  he can continue to do all his sexting and all his bathroom stuff and all of his weirdness.
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:38.880]  That article's up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com. We've got some of the drudge jokes on there.
[02:54:38.880 --> 02:54:47.880]  Wiener, rise again. Wiener plunges and it's a shrinkage. Younger women love Wiener. Clinton's
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:56.400]  pissed. Tina Brown in the, I'm not going to say that on there, erection update. Unbelievable.
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:57.400]  Unbelievable.
[02:54:57.400 --> 02:55:00.800]  But you know it's important to have people of character, right?
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:01.800]  Absolutely.
[02:55:01.800 --> 02:55:04.000]  This guy is a character. He doesn't have character.
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:08.880]  Well, I saw somebody complaining. Look at Alex coming more like TMZ. Hey, we got to have
[02:55:08.880 --> 02:55:13.280]  some fun occasionally. There's some comedies that did great like the third place winner.
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:19.000]  I mean, you know, all work and no play makes Jack crazy. I guess I am crazy. Listen, we're
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:25.080]  going to have drumroll, please. The first place winner for 100,000 Federal Reserve
[02:55:25.080 --> 02:55:35.840]  Notes. The Purge, Michael Dornan. There you go. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one that you were
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:38.840]  talking about just before the break. And some of the people who've seen excerpts, we played
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:43.560]  it on the nightly news. We played excerpts from it. We've also done it on the radio.
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:48.360]  And it's a really fine reenactment of what's been going on in DHS for quite a while. And
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:51.320]  it's a very powerful thing to see that acted out as opposed to just telling people.
[02:55:51.320 --> 02:55:55.160]  I mean, some of this has really happened where feds and state police have gotten mad in these
[02:55:55.160 --> 02:55:59.520]  meetings. What do you, the founders are bad Christians are the enemy. That's right. Yeah.
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:03.160]  So it's a very powerful thing. We got a real quick excerpt from it. Just one minute from
[02:56:03.160 --> 02:56:09.040]  it. It's kind of from the Purge, the winner of the Paul Revere Contest 100,000 Federal
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:14.840]  Reserve Notes. Here's a one minute clip. Department of Homeland Security had. We're
[02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:19.240]  going to continue to purchase ammunition to keep it off the open market. This prevents
[02:56:19.240 --> 02:56:23.280]  these extremists from getting ammunition in their hands. Additionally, we've purchased
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:28.680]  7,000 assault weapons. These weapons will be issued to newly formed FEMA youth corps
[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:33.440]  brigades. It's apparent that the world has entered into a currency crisis and trade
[02:56:33.440 --> 02:56:38.920]  disputes that could actually lead to civil unrest and armed conflict. Now, in the past,
[02:56:38.920 --> 02:56:43.440]  extremists were easy to identify. They were skinheads, KKK members, radical political
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:48.680]  ideologists. Well, now it's become a little more difficult. This group includes anti-abortionists,
[02:56:48.680 --> 02:56:55.240]  pro-constitutionalists, believers in biblical end times, gun owners, and most importantly,
[02:56:55.240 --> 02:57:00.960]  military veterans. Excuse me, but military veterans are not extremists. In believers
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:06.320]  in end times, that's like every Christian in America. That's millions and millions
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:17.560]  of people. And they're good people. And again, they really get it for the average American
[02:57:17.560 --> 02:57:21.080]  to say, see, it's a foreign takeover. And no, it's not German. It's globalist. It's
[02:57:21.080 --> 02:57:25.600]  new world order. But the point is, it really gets it across. And that film has been seen
[02:57:25.600 --> 02:57:28.800]  hundreds of thousands of times, well, on their channel, on our channel. It needs to be seen
[02:57:28.800 --> 02:57:34.880]  millions of times, infowars.com, forward slash paul. You've got 600 films linked on there,
[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:39.320]  about 300 something on the side, but more online. All there on every subject, documentary
[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:45.520]  comedy, to wake people up. That was our goal. It was a test. But really, phase two is regardless
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:51.560]  is trying to work with some of these people to then finance them to make future films
[02:57:51.560 --> 02:57:52.560]  with us.
[02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:55.760]  And let me tell you a story in terms about waking people up. We had one of the contestants
[02:57:55.760 --> 02:57:59.880]  who made the finalists send us a letter and say that for the longest time, he's tried
[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:02.160]  to explain what's going on to his parents.
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:03.160]  You showed me that letter.
[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:07.520]  Yeah. And because he became a finalist, she went to the Operation Paul Revere site and
[02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:10.720]  he said his mom was up to like two or three in the morning and called him the next morning.
[02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:14.600]  She had been looking at all these different topics and she got it because she saw the
[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:19.040]  variety of what was produced and because of the way that it was presented. So hats off
[02:58:19.040 --> 02:58:22.520]  to all the people who did something here, their work is having an effect and we're
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:27.480]  going to continue to showcase their work on our site and on the nightly news and talk
[02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:28.480]  about it.
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:31.360]  Oh yeah. For months, you're going to see stuff we haven't aired on the nightly news,
[02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:35.960]  on the radio and all of you can watch it right now. Great job, David. Great job, contestants.
[02:58:35.960 --> 02:58:39.560]  Great job makers of the purge. You can get 100,000 fellow reserve notes. Of course,
[02:58:39.560 --> 02:58:41.560]  part of it will get taxed out and sent to the farm banks.
[02:58:41.560 --> 02:58:42.560]  Thank you for listening.
[02:58:42.560 --> 02:58:45.760]  This is part of the slavery, but you understand it's part of the purge, but we'll be sending
[02:58:45.760 --> 02:59:15.520]  you that. We'll be getting you on the radio show.
