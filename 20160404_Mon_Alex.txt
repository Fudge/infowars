[00:00.000 --> 00:07.880]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[00:09.240 --> 00:13.160]  This is a Monday global broadcast original transmission
[00:13.160 --> 00:21.600]  We are live get locked in loaded strapped in because this is gonna be another roller coaster transmission of mass awakening as we
[00:22.040 --> 00:25.200]  Shake the sleeping giant out of its catatonic brain dead
[00:25.200 --> 00:33.480]  Mine controlled state one of the top survivalists writers researchers in the world also best-selling fiction author
[00:34.160 --> 00:38.120]  James Wesley Rawls formerly with army intelligence
[00:38.640 --> 00:42.520]  And I'm just your average army intelligence, but let's just say he saw quite a bit of stuff
[00:42.520 --> 00:48.360]  I've run into some really high-level people and they go oh you have James Leslie Rawls on like generals and people they go
[00:48.360 --> 00:49.880]  He did a lot of good work for this country
[00:49.880 --> 00:58.760]  So he's a very interesting guy knows what he's talking about. He'll be coming on in the second hour into the third hour today
[00:59.400 --> 01:06.640]  The last 30 minutes of the three hours that I host because then David Knight comes into the fourth hour as we expand transmission here
[01:07.920 --> 01:11.920]  We're going to have Rob do from Wisconsin and we're gonna have also
[01:13.800 --> 01:19.440]  Our investigative journalist on the ground from another state Richard Reeves joining us with an update
[01:19.440 --> 01:24.280]  on campaign 2016 that is the most highly covered
[01:25.200 --> 01:30.840]  Campaign in the US worldwide. We've ever seen such a huge deal obviously with the populist
[01:31.520 --> 01:33.120]  anti-globalist Trump
[01:33.120 --> 01:39.680]  Causing seismic shifts and huge pangs of fear in the robber baron kleptocratic
[01:40.400 --> 01:42.400]  oligarchal
[01:42.600 --> 01:44.600]  Legion of globalism
[01:44.600 --> 01:50.320]  So David Knight coming up in the fourth hour fourth hour is important and we've added it because then there's a lot of news breaking during
[01:50.320 --> 01:54.760]  The show a lot of special reports a lot of special guests a lot of days the fourth hour
[01:54.760 --> 01:59.200]  I think is just as good and informative sometimes more so than the first second or third hour
[01:59.520 --> 02:03.720]  And we also have seven o'clock every night the nightly news because so much is happening in this world
[02:03.920 --> 02:08.040]  We need to add more reporters more investigative journalists more people on the ground
[02:08.040 --> 02:12.800]  That's why I've for eight years been doing the Sunday show four to six p.m. As well did that live yesterday
[02:12.800 --> 02:14.800]  Okay
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.600]  Where to begin obviously when we come back, I'm gonna kick off into all of this
[02:21.400 --> 02:26.600]  There are big new developments when it comes to the big steel of election 2016
[02:27.520 --> 02:29.640]  Casey and others are mainlining that idea
[02:31.240 --> 02:33.240]  The establishment
[02:34.200 --> 02:39.680]  Frontrunner is obviously in second place. That's Ted Cruz with the bushes fully running him now
[02:39.680 --> 02:44.520]  they always did it turns out that's been confirmed, but now they're totally sock puppeting him and
[02:45.680 --> 02:47.680]  they are coming out and
[02:48.960 --> 02:52.840]  Stealing the delegates not just in Tennessee not just in Louisiana, but now in Nevada
[02:53.400 --> 02:57.720]  Doesn't matter that Trump won those states Ted Cruz is to be given those states
[02:58.520 --> 03:04.000]  And now that there's not a bigger uproar and that they're officially preparing to steal it all at the convention
[03:04.400 --> 03:06.400]  they are stealing it before that and
[03:06.400 --> 03:10.040]  The mainstream media has combined all of its forces
[03:10.320 --> 03:17.160]  Against the American people forget who Trump is against the American people in our popular vote and are stealing it from us in broad
[03:17.600 --> 03:19.600]  daylight at high noon
[03:20.040 --> 03:26.520]  So that is coming up as well today. I just can't leave. I'm actually reading this headline here
[03:27.440 --> 03:32.640]  Where they just calmly report Cruz staring Trump Arizona delegates isn't that just special?
[03:32.640 --> 03:40.720]  And this will tie into mr. Rawls joining us China jitters could trigger global market bloodbath
[03:41.480 --> 03:43.480]  IMF warrants
[03:44.960 --> 03:50.000]  China jitters could trigger global market bloodbath IMF warrants
[03:51.480 --> 03:57.360]  Well, that's always been the plan hasn't it and they'll use this new crisis for a whole new round of banker bailouts
[03:57.360 --> 04:05.760]  Consolidation you name it gun owners of America claims victory over Bloomberg billions very exciting article from right Bart
[04:05.760 --> 04:08.040]  We're gonna be getting later this week
[04:08.640 --> 04:14.200]  Larry Pratt of gun owners of America on to discuss the latest battle and the state of the war
[04:14.640 --> 04:20.240]  To defend the Second Amendment against the operatives of foreign banking cartels like
[04:21.080 --> 04:23.080]  former mayor bloom Burgess
[04:23.440 --> 04:25.440]  supremus tyrannous
[04:25.440 --> 04:28.760]  Then coming up early in this hour
[04:29.760 --> 04:35.380]  My first approximation getting up Sunday morning and hearing about the biggest data leak ever in history
[04:35.880 --> 04:37.880]  Thousands of times the size of WikiLeaks
[04:38.960 --> 04:40.960]  devastating information
[04:41.440 --> 04:47.880]  What's gonna happen the world's rich and famous snared the global elite caught? Oh my gosh
[04:49.440 --> 04:52.480]  It's the big data leak of Swiss bank accounts. No, it's not
[04:52.480 --> 04:57.080]  It's the globalist striking at other groups. They don't control
[04:59.880 --> 05:04.720]  There's no doubt that our country is in serious trouble right now
[05:05.240 --> 05:08.760]  And if you're wondering how on earth we ever got in this situation
[05:09.400 --> 05:13.520]  Well, I'll tell you how when the Democrats showed their true colors
[05:13.520 --> 05:19.720]  You got angry and you elected Republicans and then when the Republicans showed their true colors
[05:19.720 --> 05:28.040]  You got angry and elected Democrats and when anyone suggested to you that both parties were corrupt and that neither side
[05:28.040 --> 05:32.560]  We're looking out for your best interest you acted like they were crazy
[05:33.080 --> 05:41.200]  But the real definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results
[05:41.320 --> 05:47.480]  That's why it is vitally important that you wake up America and break the matrix
[05:47.480 --> 05:55.560]  Info wars calm prison planet TV and the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind

[09:16.560 --> 09:18.560]  Wow, where to start okay?
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.800]  There is obviously this huge story that broke saturday night in europe
[09:24.800 --> 09:27.920]  In one of germany's biggest newspapers
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.920]  Now keep me in to do this. Will you guys give me the stack of news from last week from the german newspapers?
[09:34.400 --> 09:41.040]  With the headline top german reporters cia runs everything and then they also the the the chinese
[09:42.160 --> 09:45.840]  News out of england where they admit that it's all state run there
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.080]  I mean that's no secret and then i want to take those articles and integrate it in
[09:50.080 --> 09:54.720]  And with oh my gosh the biggest data leak on the elite ever
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.720]  Oh my gosh, this is devastating
[09:59.040 --> 10:02.080]  This is going to bring down all of the elite
[10:02.800 --> 10:07.280]  Of the world that aren't paying their taxes and it's going to stop tax havens
[10:07.360 --> 10:11.440]  And it's really going to show us who the big spider is at the center of the web
[10:12.640 --> 10:19.600]  And as soon as I read this 20-something page german newspaper article in english yesterday from nz
[10:19.600 --> 10:21.600]  I guess is the name of the big paper
[10:22.000 --> 10:24.000]  And I looked into some of its background
[10:26.640 --> 10:30.160]  It all just clicked and I went on air yesterday before they'd done all this and I said
[10:30.560 --> 10:33.360]  Notice they put it out not saying what they found in it yet
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.080]  But that for a year they've had hundreds of other newspapers working with them
[10:38.480 --> 10:45.360]  That means hundreds of other operatives inside other newspapers when you hear hundreds of other newspapers working together and none of them scooped each other
[10:45.360 --> 10:53.200]  No, nobody leaked boy when you hear that you know that means operatives inside the newspapers from german intelligence british intelligence
[10:53.840 --> 10:55.840]  us intelligence nato intelligence
[10:56.400 --> 10:58.160]  Interpol intelligence
[10:58.160 --> 11:05.280]  Hundreds of I mean i'm sitting there reading this 20 page like 19 page article and it's red flag red flag red flag red flag red flag red flag
[11:05.760 --> 11:09.360]  So I came on air yesterday four to six p.m. I'm not bragging. I just know what i'm talking about
[11:09.360 --> 11:15.120]  And I said you watch they are going to burn russian networks where they are basically
[11:16.080 --> 11:21.520]  Giving loans to countries to work with them on a smaller scale than what the imf and world bank on the globalist
[11:22.240 --> 11:25.440]  And you're going to find all sorts of russians with swiss bank accounts and
[11:25.840 --> 11:28.560]  uh bank accounts in the camons and bank accounts in
[11:29.520 --> 11:32.480]  Panama and bank accounts basically everywhere else
[11:33.840 --> 11:38.640]  And they're going to have a huge big announcement that putin's a money launderer and putin's a criminal
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.800]  I mean it was so obvious where this was going
[11:41.840 --> 11:43.840]  And they announced the international soccer
[11:43.920 --> 11:48.720]  You know football association that that's the top of the corruption. Look at the shock headline
[11:49.200 --> 11:55.200]  Russian bank chief denies putin link to two billion in offshore loans. Oh my gosh
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.040]  Our government's given five billion dollars
[11:59.040 --> 12:08.800]  Last time they admitted it last year to overthrowing ukraine through the state department funding people with machine guns
[12:09.680 --> 12:12.800]  That's five billion ukraine how about five billion
[12:13.280 --> 12:18.560]  Last time they gave us a number a year and a half ago given to the quote moderate rebels
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.760]  They spent what was it five hundred and something million trying to train some and trained four
[12:25.760 --> 12:30.400]  Of course, they didn't train four. That's the cut out front office
[12:30.720 --> 12:36.720]  The weapons get delivered to the front office with guys with short beards going. Hi. We were trained in america. Hey special forces
[12:36.720 --> 12:40.320]  We like you the troops are like, uh-huh giving them the stinger missiles the tow missiles
[12:40.720 --> 12:46.800]  And then it gets delivered in trucks down the road to al-qaeda that only started three years ago because the special forces
[12:47.920 --> 12:52.880]  NATO countries us you name it would land c-130s and guys would pull up with black flags
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.160]  With al-qaeda symbols and the troops would go what in the what I mean, they were standoffs
[12:58.160 --> 13:01.360]  You name it. They're like you got orders from the state department deliver the weapons
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  So they started this whole deal off where the
[13:07.200 --> 13:13.200]  Missiles and high impact weapons artillery you name it are delivered two guys wearing hawaiian shirts
[13:13.200 --> 13:18.320]  I've seen it on the news. They've shown mccain meeting with them. Oh, hi. I'm wearing a hawaiian shirt. Hey guys come on in
[13:18.640 --> 13:21.200]  Load the weapons in the warehouse. See you later. Thanks
[13:21.200 --> 13:26.240]  All right, yeah, I'm gonna get the Saudi ambassador on the line. Yes, sir the weapons have been delivered
[13:28.320 --> 13:34.080]  And that's why they killed the ambassador to get just three warehouses full of weapons that was just part of the invasion goodies
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.600]  Because you go back four years ago, which we first broke four years ago
[13:39.840 --> 13:46.960]  The pentagon knew the whole time and led by the u.s. Army. They refused to give the weapons to al-qaeda
[13:46.960 --> 13:51.440]  And ambassador stevens refused to give the weapons to al-qaeda
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  And so he had to die didn't he?
[13:57.040 --> 14:03.040]  And you've heard that from tosh plumley. You've heard that from colonel shaffer. You've heard that from the marine core lieutenant colonel
[14:04.160 --> 14:06.160]  We had on last week
[14:07.200 --> 14:09.440]  I mean, this is what's going on and the weapons
[14:09.440 --> 14:18.320]  Get shipped down into mexico now to fence them. That's a new thing in the last two years when they've been doing fast and furious
[14:18.880 --> 14:23.040]  Before obama even got in office. That's come out. That's why the parties are leaving alone
[14:23.040 --> 14:25.040]  But it got bigger under obama to blame the second amendment
[14:25.120 --> 14:28.480]  That was just a blowback deal though where they used that as a way to frame the second amendment
[14:28.560 --> 14:31.600]  But for the last few years they've been shipping most of the arms now through mexico
[14:33.360 --> 14:35.360]  U.s. Army issued
[14:35.360 --> 14:44.160]  What do they call it 5 5 6 the military I call it 2 2 3 the point is nato rounds 3 o.a. Full auto hang grenades rocket launchers 50 caliber Barrett's
[14:45.360 --> 14:49.760]  And colonel matt smith mech talked about all of that was last week
[14:50.320 --> 14:56.640]  This is all out in the open. It's so huge. Oh, and of course it's in the news that the french leadership and the socialist have all been caught
[14:56.640 --> 15:03.680]  Basically not paying taxes the eu bureaucrats exempt themselves from eu taxes and have swiss bank accounts lupson burg
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.640]  bank accounts Monte Carlo bank accounts in the trillions of dollars
[15:09.760 --> 15:11.760]  Trillions the world
[15:12.240 --> 15:19.200]  Currency market every day is in the multi trillions. There is 2.2 last time the government admitted it four years ago
[15:19.200 --> 15:24.880]  It's grown since then quadrillion 2.2 quadrillion in fake counterfeit
[15:25.440 --> 15:27.440]  Fred it default swaps
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.160]  And and and other counterfeit instruments
[15:30.160 --> 15:32.160]  This is so huge
[15:34.160 --> 15:37.280]  Worldwide and oh my gosh, ladies and gentlemen
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.960]  Did you hear vladimir putin and the russians are connected to 2 billion in loans
[15:44.080 --> 15:48.400]  To countries around the world to get better deals for russian affiliated businesses
[15:49.200 --> 15:54.720]  That's what the IMF and the world bank does with the u.s. Taxpayer money that we we get more than half the money of the IMF and world bank
[15:54.720 --> 15:58.720]  They go in to african-latin american asian countries you name it and say
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.640]  We're going to give you a loan but your government has to agree it all goes back to our subsidiary company
[16:04.640 --> 16:11.120]  And then most of the time they don't even build anything in the third world country. They just send the taxpayer money back to themselves
[16:12.640 --> 16:14.640]  So i'm not defending the russians
[16:14.640 --> 16:22.720]  But when you see german major investigative journals telling you that they're exposing the biggest thing in the world bank
[16:22.720 --> 16:29.040]  That they're exposing the biggest thing in the world. That's because people are so ignorant remember merkel was criticizing the nsa
[16:29.440 --> 16:35.600]  Turned out merkel has like double the spying on the germans of anybody else. I mean no one is spot on like germans
[16:35.840 --> 16:37.120]  It's the worst
[16:37.120 --> 16:39.680]  It's it's just over and beyond anything you've ever seen
[16:40.320 --> 16:42.640]  That's just been going on since world war two. It never stopped
[16:44.960 --> 16:50.160]  That's no secret. I mean all of germany just became stasi run basically facebook works with the stasi now
[16:50.160 --> 16:55.040]  They've resurrected it that's in the associated press with a straight face. I mean this is what's going on
[16:55.280 --> 17:03.440]  This is what's happening the german press is the most lying most corrupt most deceptive most out of control. I'll tell you why
[17:04.720 --> 17:08.160]  The russians in the united states killed 21 million germans
[17:08.160 --> 17:12.720]  That was more than a third of them took over and killed anybody didn't play ball at the world war two
[17:13.040 --> 17:18.960]  Germany is run by the globalist 100 percent. That's why their policies of open borders are the same as obamas
[17:18.960 --> 17:27.440]  They're carbon copies the politically correct language everything germany is occupied germany is controlled germany is captured
[17:27.520 --> 17:31.200]  There's only one country in europe that isn't globalist run
[17:32.320 --> 17:37.600]  One country and that's france and they are pathetic. They are corrupt. They are ridiculous
[17:37.680 --> 17:38.560]  They are nuts
[17:38.560 --> 17:44.160]  But general de gaulle when he was president had french troops go in and there were even firefights around
[17:44.160 --> 17:51.440]  Around france that people never heard about with nato. You can look it up and took the french nuclear weapons that were quote assigned to them
[17:51.680 --> 17:53.520]  took the nato nukes
[17:53.520 --> 17:58.720]  And france became sovereign again, then they sent in british special forces the jackal and others to try to kill him
[18:00.800 --> 18:02.800]  Then they make movies about it
[18:03.120 --> 18:07.360]  Where it doesn't point out that it's i mean they point out it's british commando, but not that it's british government
[18:07.840 --> 18:12.560]  I mean so the french are the only country in europe that isn't completely run by the globalist
[18:12.560 --> 18:19.760]  And they're just as bad and horrible the whole thing comes from france with the jacobas and the french revolution. I'm not defending them
[18:21.040 --> 18:25.360]  But you've got some infighting by these power structures, so i'm gonna get more into that later, but it is just
[18:26.080 --> 18:32.560]  Ridiculous that as soon as I got up this morning. I knew what I'd read. Oh the international football league. Oh the international
[18:33.440 --> 18:37.200]  organizations of this and that anything russia has any play in
[18:38.320 --> 18:40.320]  And anything that has any media power
[18:40.320 --> 18:48.160]  The anglo-american establishment is taking it over with scandals and investigations to bring it in the fbi's and dieting basically everybody
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.840]  Internationally just the fbi comes your hotel in germany, but it doesn't matter throws a bag over your head
[18:55.760 --> 18:58.640]  Remember remember how when they thought stud was coming into germany or other places
[18:58.800 --> 19:01.360]  They had fighter jets in the air and everything nato did
[19:02.080 --> 19:04.080]  I mean that's all occupied folks
[19:04.480 --> 19:06.480]  That's occupied
[19:06.480 --> 19:08.480]  And
[19:10.080 --> 19:14.560]  It's just incredible that that's what's really going on. This is a major war with russia
[19:14.800 --> 19:18.320]  There's economic war military war proxy war
[19:18.880 --> 19:20.880]  in internal infiltration
[19:20.960 --> 19:22.400]  sabotage
[19:22.400 --> 19:27.040]  Currency wars going on and now they're going to go after the entire russian network
[19:27.600 --> 19:32.400]  Internationally at the same time roll up millions of people that went to set up legal
[19:33.120 --> 19:35.120]  tax offshore
[19:35.120 --> 19:39.440]  Accounts that the globalists allowed under law, but they don't want the general public to have it
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.080]  And and then when you have jury trials when when people fight to get them
[19:44.160 --> 19:48.640]  They'll say they were in a russian network. They were in a russian offshore, which isn't even true
[19:49.200 --> 19:53.600]  You see it's just multinational groups that the russians were working in so that's all this is
[19:53.920 --> 19:58.720]  That's why the quote data dumps the biggest ever because it's right down to people with 20 000 dollars

[24:22.640 --> 24:24.960]  We need that scene towards the end of
[24:25.680 --> 24:27.680]  Scarface with alpachino
[24:28.400 --> 24:30.880]  The movie i use as a cultural lexicon
[24:30.880 --> 24:32.880]  Because it's got so many lessons in it
[24:33.520 --> 24:38.720]  And he's sitting there in the fine french restaurant in a tuxedo with all these old rich people
[24:40.160 --> 24:43.440]  And he's being a little bit loud and so the major D comes over and goes sir and he goes
[24:44.160 --> 24:47.200]  So that's what it is. This is what it is. You know you've
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.480]  You've got a bag for a belly. Your wife is so drugged out. She can't even have a kid
[24:53.120 --> 24:55.280]  You're in here with a bunch of these mummies drinking
[24:55.280 --> 25:02.160]  Fancy wine who are dead already? And then all of you fake people that stole your money or screwed folks over or whatever
[25:02.400 --> 25:11.200]  Need to be able to point your finger at me and say there's the bad guy. Well, say good night to the bad guy
[25:15.520 --> 25:17.520]  Is this the last time you're going to see me like this
[25:18.640 --> 25:20.640]  What he means is i'm not coming back to your french restaurant
[25:20.640 --> 25:26.480]  I don't need your acceptance. I don't want your upper class. You stink. You're a joke
[25:27.680 --> 25:33.680]  That's a very empowering moment when you don't need the boat bigger than the next guy or the car better than the next guy
[25:33.840 --> 25:37.600]  When somebody pulls up in their car and it's faster than yours. You're like great dude. I don't care
[25:39.680 --> 25:44.320]  But it's that moment when you sit there and you instantly look at a news article
[25:45.120 --> 25:50.160]  You go, oh my gosh, it's the germans. Oh, yeah, it's a it's an intelligence agency affiliated group
[25:50.160 --> 25:53.440]  Oh, they worked for over a year with hundreds of other newspapers
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.080]  With key people to vet it all that was to go through it and get permission that it didn't burn any other clandestine
[26:00.400 --> 26:02.720]  Western affiliated group to cherry pick
[26:04.880 --> 26:11.120]  An entire giant complex of law firms robbed through nsa technology back doors
[26:11.360 --> 26:18.480]  There's the big crime to selectively blackmail over the last year and roll up foreign intelligence networks
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.520]  And to get them to turn and flip to work for you. So you won't get prosecuted
[26:24.480 --> 26:30.880]  And then you have the nerve to put it out there like you've exposed the biggest money laundering network in history
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.280]  $2 billion. Oh my gosh, and it's russian loans
[26:37.440 --> 26:40.400]  Boy, I tell you those you know what russia should be blown off the map
[26:40.560 --> 26:46.160]  Everyone should be executed in russia for $2 billion in loans. I agree. They're they're the worst criminals on earth
[26:46.160 --> 26:52.720]  Anyone worse needs to be getting more trouble. Oh wait, our government's run by criminals that have created thousands of quadrillion
[26:53.840 --> 26:55.440]  thousands of trillions
[26:55.440 --> 27:00.880]  Have I mean I could play the cnn pieces even I used to cover this 15 16 years ago, and I couldn't believe
[27:01.520 --> 27:04.480]  The court filings I was covering on air that weren't on the news
[27:04.560 --> 27:10.720]  I was having lawyers in to talk about it in like 1998 1999. I would have lawyers on
[27:10.720 --> 27:18.000]  And pro say people that had the rulings where they would have a deed to their 50 acre ranchette that they'd had for decades
[27:18.240 --> 27:22.400]  That they'd paid cash for and then bank of america was usually bank of america
[27:23.760 --> 27:29.600]  Some cases Wells Fargo, you name it would come along and just say we're foreclosing we own it and they'd go that you don't have a deed
[27:29.600 --> 27:31.600]  I own this they go. No, we have the deed
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.840]  And a lot of times it wasn't even their fault at Wells Fargo or Bank of America
[27:35.840 --> 27:41.120]  They'd been sold it by some other bank who bought it from some other bank and no one even knew where it came from
[27:41.120 --> 27:43.120]  I've got cnn pieces
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.240]  That I've aired. I mean if you're doubting this, it's incredible and believe me. I doubted it too, but but everybody's heard about this now
[27:51.280 --> 27:56.000]  Where a family in florida had a million dollar home. They built themselves 20 years before
[27:57.040 --> 28:00.640]  This is like in 2009 all this came out member the sub prime deal
[28:00.640 --> 28:05.440]  They built the house on cash. They themselves were developers. It was their house
[28:06.560 --> 28:09.680]  And bank of america had bought the loan and since sold it
[28:10.400 --> 28:12.400]  There was like 18 times again
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.360]  And then they came and took their house
[28:15.840 --> 28:19.920]  And then other banks came to take the house. There was never a loan. There was never a note
[28:20.560 --> 28:22.560]  They paid for the house outright
[28:23.040 --> 28:27.120]  Their name was just thrown in with their deed and stolen
[28:27.120 --> 28:34.160]  And bank of america went ahead to court and in the first round took the house finally it got bumped up to another judge
[28:34.160 --> 28:36.160]  The judge heard it that was finally a hearing
[28:36.800 --> 28:42.000]  And ordered bank of america to give them their house and their money back for the cost that they had fighting it
[28:42.480 --> 28:47.120]  A couple hundred thousand dollars. This is on cnn and then they go in
[28:49.360 --> 28:53.920]  Six months later bank of america won't pay them back won't give them the house so the judge orders
[28:53.920 --> 28:59.280]  The people's court. That's what it is the constables to go with the sheriff's department and
[29:00.960 --> 29:06.320]  Take the money out of the vault or order them to write a cashier's check and at that point they folded and did it
[29:06.800 --> 29:09.360]  That is the mega arrogant total
[29:10.320 --> 29:15.680]  Absolute corruption together to sweet justice of florida couple foreclosure on bank of america. There it is. They guys found it
[29:16.720 --> 29:18.720]  June 6 2011
[29:19.280 --> 29:23.040]  This stuff's coming sort of coming out in 2009. I was covering it in the 90s
[29:23.040 --> 29:25.040]  and
[29:25.360 --> 29:27.360]  Oh, but the russians two billion dollars
[29:27.440 --> 29:32.160]  This what I mean folks the whole system the interest rates the currency rates the stock market
[29:32.160 --> 29:39.840]  They admitted last week is 98 fraud run by the federal reserve the last decade. It's all fraud all insider trading 99 98 of it. I mean
[29:40.880 --> 29:42.880]  This is literally satan
[29:42.960 --> 29:47.680]  Telling you that casper the friendly ghost is the most powerful demon in the galaxy. Okay
[29:48.320 --> 29:51.280]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[29:51.280 --> 29:54.960]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[29:59.680 --> 30:04.080]  Who do you prefer barack obama for george w. Bush?
[30:04.560 --> 30:10.320]  Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, these guys are corporate spokesmen. They're not leaders
[30:10.480 --> 30:17.120]  I mean, they both started illegal wars. Hell. They both tortured people. They bailed out criminal corporations
[30:17.120 --> 30:23.200]  And they spied on you. They both violated the constitution and they even committed war crimes
[30:23.440 --> 30:27.200]  So what's it gonna take? I mean, what will it take to finally wake you up?
[30:27.360 --> 30:28.160]  Think about it
[30:28.160 --> 30:34.160]  If joseph stallin ran for president as a democrat and adolf hitler ran as a republican
[30:34.320 --> 30:39.120]  One of them would end up leading our country its elephants and asses
[30:39.520 --> 30:46.000]  Screwing the masses and your choice between the two parties is a myth because in reality

[33:43.120 --> 33:48.640]  But if you actually go back to the history books over 150 years there was a period of time when it was snowing in the caribbean
[33:49.520 --> 33:52.240]  There are reports 400 years ago in british
[33:52.960 --> 33:56.480]  fleet journals in historical books. I've read about snow
[33:57.360 --> 33:59.440]  in the summer
[33:59.440 --> 34:01.440]  in the caribbean
[34:01.680 --> 34:03.680]  in the early summer
[34:04.640 --> 34:08.000]  That's because the only thing that's constant is change in the climate
[34:08.000 --> 34:14.320]  That's why they talk about climate stability and stopping climate change. Just a few years ago. It was global warming
[34:15.440 --> 34:19.440]  But then the warming it turned out stopped 18 years ago and we started
[34:20.240 --> 34:25.120]  Cooling the last six or seven because of sunspot activity. The sun is not generating so much heat
[34:25.680 --> 34:29.680]  You know the un voted five years ago at the un summit in covet hanging denmark
[34:29.680 --> 34:33.600]  They're trying to push a world government treaty for carbon taxes. They said well
[34:33.600 --> 34:38.960]  We voted because a group of scientists worldwide are saying it's the sun that controls most our weather
[34:39.360 --> 34:43.760]  They voted though the un voted and said that the sun does not affect climate
[34:44.400 --> 34:48.240]  Just like the pope I guess said 600 years ago that the earth was the center of the universe
[34:49.920 --> 34:52.880]  And the sun orbited it of course, that's not true
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.720]  But the un you know, they they they tell us the polar bear population
[34:58.720 --> 35:04.960]  Is uh endangered? Well, you can use that word all day
[35:05.440 --> 35:07.920]  It's not a endangered species folks
[35:07.920 --> 35:13.760]  Its numbers are up five fold in northern europe and about four fold in the northern
[35:15.120 --> 35:16.880]  united states and canada
[35:16.880 --> 35:19.600]  You talk about alaska and over into canada and you can just pull those numbers up
[35:19.840 --> 35:22.800]  Polar bears are five fold up on average globally
[35:24.400 --> 35:26.400]  And expanding their ranges
[35:26.400 --> 35:32.160]  So there are more human human interactions. There's more interactions with polar bears and grizzlies as well
[35:32.400 --> 35:34.400]  They're finding a lot of grizzly kills
[35:34.400 --> 35:38.320]  Because the polar bears are about twice as more powerful just rip their heads off
[35:38.880 --> 35:44.240]  Uh, and so we can all enjoy that now the little sweet polar bears and the coca-cola commercials that are all dead
[35:44.320 --> 35:46.320]  And oh when the penguins can't swim
[35:46.640 --> 35:48.800]  This is how dumb they think they are
[35:50.000 --> 35:54.400]  Of course, I kept saying polar bears could swim 300 miles. I was wrong longest polar bear swim recorded
[35:54.400 --> 35:56.400]  426 miles straight
[35:56.480 --> 35:58.480]  They hunt beluga and walrus
[35:59.120 --> 36:03.600]  In the spring and summer and then swim back to the rocky uh escarpments
[36:04.160 --> 36:05.760]  Uh for the winter
[36:05.760 --> 36:10.000]  And then have their babies in the den and then emerge in the spring. That's that's how they operate
[36:10.800 --> 36:13.920]  And uh, but you've seen the newscast saying they are
[36:14.560 --> 36:16.160]  you know out there
[36:16.160 --> 36:18.160]  Drowned in the ocean
[36:18.240 --> 36:21.200]  Because they can't they can't swim and there's no ice and
[36:21.200 --> 36:27.760]  How many shows this polar bear desperately looks for a place to sleep the night but can't find it and it'll show
[36:27.760 --> 36:29.760]  I'm like paddling
[36:29.760 --> 36:36.160]  These penguins are under the same assault. I mean, that's how dumb they think you are now those are in children's shows
[36:37.280 --> 36:42.640]  Children's for discovery children Nickelodeon. It's not on the regular nature shows for adults
[36:46.240 --> 36:49.840]  The most powerful land animal may also be the most powerful sea animal
[36:49.840 --> 36:52.720]  Swimming more than 300 miles to hunt whale
[36:53.520 --> 36:56.160]  With one arm it holds in and of a thousand pound
[36:56.720 --> 36:58.240]  beluga bull
[36:58.240 --> 37:00.000]  boom drags it in
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  onto the onto the ice
[37:02.640 --> 37:09.360]  One arm boom just drags it right up like it's nothing swimming 400 miles. We now know 400 miles
[37:09.600 --> 37:12.160]  And they show the famous photo of one perched on
[37:12.960 --> 37:14.160]  a
[37:14.160 --> 37:16.160]  floating piece of ice
[37:16.160 --> 37:23.520]  That that has been in autobahn societies and in thousands of publications and the cover of calendars save the earth
[37:23.920 --> 37:29.760]  Stop global warming. Look the juvenile polar bear. It can't live. Just look at those forearms
[37:31.600 --> 37:33.600]  Look at those back legs
[37:33.760 --> 37:35.760]  Look at that amazing creature
[37:35.840 --> 37:37.840]  It's up there hunting whales
[37:38.400 --> 37:40.400]  Hunting seals hunting
[37:41.440 --> 37:43.440]  walrus
[37:43.440 --> 37:50.240]  But according to the magic intellectual liberals that want to control what language we can use because they're so liberal that
[37:51.360 --> 37:54.160]  Is the last hours as the ice melts
[37:55.680 --> 37:57.680]  And they can point cameras every year
[37:58.400 --> 38:03.840]  In the spring and summer at the collapsing glaciers saying look the ice is melting. It always melts
[38:04.080 --> 38:06.080]  It snows in the winter. It piles up
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.080]  It flows out as ice and in the spring and summer it melts
[38:10.080 --> 38:16.000]  It contracts in the warm months expands in the cold months in the Arctic and Antarctic
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.880]  I mean, I'm stating things that are known facts here
[38:21.200 --> 38:24.320]  But you see I don't have access to kids in public school or the colleges
[38:26.960 --> 38:30.240]  I don't have access to them you've got access to them as their parents
[38:31.040 --> 38:32.160]  or
[38:32.160 --> 38:36.880]  You know, maybe as the football coach or whatever. I mean just somehow warn them about how they're being lied to
[38:36.880 --> 38:41.360]  Okay, I literally have hundreds of hundreds of bombshell articles. I'm not getting to them. I apologize
[38:42.640 --> 38:46.720]  When James Wesley Rawls joins us for the next hour, I'm going to get into the state of the world economy
[38:46.720 --> 38:51.840]  I'm going to get in the state of the attack on guns from his intel his sources. He's got a lot of amazing sources
[38:55.440 --> 38:57.440]  Inside
[38:58.080 --> 39:00.080]  Connections will sleep with that
[39:00.480 --> 39:04.880]  On what's going on clearly trying to start a race war clearly trying to start a class war
[39:04.880 --> 39:10.480]  Clearly, they're accelerating to steal the election. What does James Wesley Rawls one of the top survivalist experts out there?
[39:10.480 --> 39:12.080]  One of the most respected
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.440]  Joining us for an hour and a half today. We'll also open the phones up in the second half by the interview with him
[39:19.200 --> 39:24.720]  But before I go any further, let's just get into the latest Donald Trump news
[39:25.680 --> 39:28.160]  And election 2016 news it is huge
[39:28.880 --> 39:33.840]  The steel is even getting more nasty more flagrant more unabashed
[39:33.840 --> 39:35.840]  More
[39:35.840 --> 39:37.840]  hubris hoodspub
[39:38.480 --> 39:40.480]  bravada
[39:43.280 --> 39:45.280]  A plum, I mean, I don't know what word
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.840]  Confidence game just just just total con game. It's like a guy in a fur coat with jewels all over him
[39:52.560 --> 39:54.240]  peacock him
[39:54.240 --> 39:56.000]  And studies show it may look ridiculous
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.040]  Maybe out of control
[39:57.040 --> 40:00.960]  But if you're really confident and walk into a bar with some of the most beautiful women out there
[40:00.960 --> 40:05.200]  You're going to leave as many of them as you can put on your arm because peacocking works
[40:05.760 --> 40:07.760]  And that's what these guys do
[40:08.560 --> 40:10.560]  They just act confident
[40:11.520 --> 40:13.760]  As they rob everybody but I've noticed in this culture
[40:14.720 --> 40:20.480]  Peacocking isn't enough so many men peacock in business and life when they don't really have the goods
[40:20.800 --> 40:23.760]  They don't have the horsepower under the hood. They don't have the brains
[40:24.400 --> 40:27.360]  They don't have the ingenuity. They don't have the background the connections
[40:27.360 --> 40:31.600]  All they got is acting smart keeping their mouth shut and acting confident
[40:33.440 --> 40:37.920]  I remember being about 15 16 and noticing like the bullies and the thugs acted like they were tough
[40:37.920 --> 40:40.400]  They acted like they were smart, but there was nothing under the hood
[40:41.680 --> 40:43.680]  It's all talk no action
[40:46.640 --> 40:49.680]  And that's what our society is that's why I'm still against this elite
[40:50.240 --> 40:52.320]  Because they're not just con men that have taken over
[40:52.320 --> 40:58.720]  They're in competition with other wealth and other ideas and art and literature and culture
[40:58.880 --> 41:01.280]  So they want to stun it and make it ugly and dumb
[41:02.080 --> 41:06.480]  And mentally ill so they can rule us really that's our rulers really
[41:07.120 --> 41:09.120]  really
[41:09.120 --> 41:15.040]  I mean, I wouldn't want rulers to begin with but these are the nastiest and ugliest and wickedest and
[41:16.240 --> 41:18.480]  most spiritually twisted
[41:18.480 --> 41:21.440]  Hunchbacked I've ever seen
[41:23.920 --> 41:26.480]  And I think that goes to say why they hate us so much
[41:27.200 --> 41:31.600]  Because you may not think anything of yourself, but because you are a moral loving soul
[41:32.320 --> 41:34.320]  These devils don't like you
[41:36.400 --> 41:43.120]  Because they see what a bright beautiful creature you are they don't like it. Okay, let's get into the trump situation. Uh, first off
[41:43.120 --> 41:50.560]  Anthroplex has many of the same herbs that are in super male or super female vitality. The two things don't compete with each other
[41:50.640 --> 41:52.640]  They augment each other
[41:53.200 --> 41:58.480]  And quite frankly, I went to dr. Group and I went to other big top labs and I said I want something better than super male vitality
[42:00.320 --> 42:04.960]  And they said why this is a really good formula. It's cold press. It's excellent. You have great reviews and I said well
[42:05.680 --> 42:09.520]  People just like more products and I said quite frankly. I want something that costs less money
[42:09.520 --> 42:18.000]  That has a lot of the same herbs that are high quality non-gmo fresh but are dry because that costs less
[42:21.040 --> 42:23.040]  And then dr. Group said well, you know what I can do
[42:23.040 --> 42:26.080]  There's a few things that don't work in the formula with super male or super female
[42:26.320 --> 42:31.440]  That don't work to be cold press that I would have added. I'll have this added to this and then it's a great base
[42:32.240 --> 42:37.360]  For somebody to add super male or super female vitality on top of or you could take it by itself and quite frankly
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.080]  I get incredible results. It's very sure everybody and we don't sell it as an aphrodisiac
[42:42.240 --> 42:45.040]  But that really is the most noticeable thing. I'll just tell you right now
[42:45.600 --> 42:48.000]  And so, uh, it's got a five star five
[42:48.560 --> 42:54.640]  Pure five star rating. That's the highest we've got usually it's 4.9 4.7 third party review site power reviews
[42:56.320 --> 42:58.320]  Five star review
[42:58.640 --> 43:00.880]  And it's unbelievable and quite frankly
[43:02.640 --> 43:04.640]  Well, just just try it out for yourself
[43:04.640 --> 43:08.560]  It works in women too. I don't know why we ended up just coming out targeting men
[43:09.680 --> 43:14.240]  But it works in men and women and it is selling out. We won't have more for a couple weeks
[43:14.240 --> 43:16.640]  Just want to give you a heads up on that sign up for auto ship
[43:19.040 --> 43:20.880]  And by that say when you want to be delivered again
[43:20.880 --> 43:26.640]  You can cancel any time you get 10 off and on orders above 50 dollars 50 dollars or more you get free shipping
[43:26.640 --> 43:34.240]  That's free shipping on orders of 50 dollars or more and you get 10 off when
[43:35.440 --> 43:39.840]  You sign up for auto ship on any of the products that could be hillary for present t-shirts. You name it
[43:41.040 --> 43:45.760]  Molan lobby shirts. You name it. So excited to see so many great listeners out there
[43:45.760 --> 43:47.040]  We have those live feeds
[43:47.040 --> 43:51.200]  It's really made our tv viewers and radio listeners excited when they tune in info wars.com
[43:51.200 --> 43:55.680]  Ports last show or different tv stations around the country like houston and others and they're able to
[43:56.480 --> 43:58.480]  Actually go down a line of trump
[43:58.400 --> 44:03.840]  Folks or people going into a trump rally and maybe one in ten. That's conservative is wearing an info wars.com shirt
[44:04.800 --> 44:07.760]  An exciting part is some of the shirts are homemade. They're not shirts. I may
[44:09.360 --> 44:12.160]  So there's a whole industry out there of folks putting on info war shirts
[44:12.720 --> 44:14.960]  And as people have learned that I haven't come after them for that
[44:15.920 --> 44:18.640]  Uh, it's really proliferated all I want to just get the word out
[44:18.640 --> 44:23.360]  And so there are a lot of cool designs out there on the web. I'll tell you that aren't ours
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.880]  I'm gonna start doing something though where I'm gonna reach out to people that have made really cool info war shirts
[44:29.200 --> 44:32.960]  And license them from them their design and and pay them a little bit
[44:33.440 --> 44:39.040]  But the hillary for present t-shirt till the end of time is the sold out limited edition when the people got so mad
[44:39.040 --> 44:42.000]  We quit selling so I changed it so it's a new limited edition
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.520]  But technically it's it's almost a white line because it's almost the same shirt
[44:45.520 --> 44:51.760]  But it's it's enough different. Look, it's back by popular demand. I've had six or seven other limited editions never brought them back
[44:52.000 --> 44:59.360]  People really got upset by us taking it off. And so it's back with red lettering on the back info wars.com legalized freedom
[45:00.160 --> 45:01.440]  And on the front
[45:01.440 --> 45:07.360]  It's the same except it says hillary for present 2016 and then a small stamp under it till the end of time
[45:08.880 --> 45:11.120]  That we should probably come in the next segment with magic moment
[45:11.120 --> 45:16.800]  Because it ties into the magic moment. She actually gets indicted or the fbi director resigns because the justice department won't indict her
[45:16.880 --> 45:20.800]  That is going to bring these people so close to being arrested. Oh and finally
[45:21.360 --> 45:25.600]  We've introduced the new product that I know is going to be the ultimate game changer
[45:27.360 --> 45:31.680]  The fields are depleted the food is depleted the soil is depleted. You're not getting all the minerals you need
[45:31.920 --> 45:36.400]  You're not getting all the vitamins you need. You're not getting the amino acids you need. This just got everything
[45:36.400 --> 45:41.760]  I'm so proud of it. It tastes so good. It's fruit punch flavored naturally flavored by what's already in it
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.480]  It's got a thousand percent of what you need a vitamin c the proper organic form. It's got everything
[45:46.480 --> 45:48.480]  I'm so proud of this product
[45:49.120 --> 45:57.360]  And again, we promote other great products not just arts, but info wars life.com has the amazing new vitamin mineral fusion available
[45:57.600 --> 46:02.960]  They'll watch the informational video read about it. It's amazing and it will sell out within the next three days
[46:02.960 --> 46:06.560]  I just want to tell everybody we will hold some back for folks that sign up for auto ship
[46:06.720 --> 46:11.760]  So you can always sign up for anything that's sold out for auto ship and still get it because we always hold back enough
[46:11.920 --> 46:13.920]  to cover the orders we have and then
[46:14.880 --> 46:18.720]  We have an algorithm for what we think other orders will be so we hold back enough to make sure
[46:19.040 --> 46:23.600]  Nothing is ever sold out when you sign up for auto ship and you get 10 off. So another reason to do that
[46:25.040 --> 46:28.240]  But we're so proud of this and again, you can take it with other multi vitamins
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.040]  You can take it with other great products that are clean
[46:31.040 --> 46:34.720]  I mean, you can't take it with other synthetic multi vitamins
[46:34.720 --> 46:42.400]  But you can take it with beyond tangy tangerine original and 2.0 that are both excellent as well and game changers at info wars health.com
[46:42.800 --> 46:46.960]  Because they're both of types that are natural so you're able to absorb it
[46:47.120 --> 46:50.880]  But the synthetic stuff stay away from that do your own research. This is not synthetic
[46:51.280 --> 46:55.520]  So info wars team.com info wars health.com for beyond tangy tangerine
[46:55.920 --> 47:00.240]  And for our vitamin mineral fusion that is just so delicious and I absolutely love
[47:00.240 --> 47:02.960]  Uh, you know, my kids love it. You can go to info wars
[47:05.120 --> 47:10.640]  Life.com but the two do not compete with each other. They augment each other. I want to be absolutely clear about that
[47:10.960 --> 47:12.960]  secret 12 the highest quality
[47:12.960 --> 47:16.880]  Organic methyl cabalamin vitamin b12 be taken under the tongue. It was sold out for months
[47:17.120 --> 47:22.240]  It is back the reason it keeps selling out folks is these are so organic so pure so laboratory grade
[47:22.640 --> 47:28.480]  That it's hard to do and it's hard to pass california standards and and most people, you know say do not pass california standards
[47:28.480 --> 47:33.520]  But we're so neurotic that all of our products except I think one of them because they don't accept loyal silver
[47:34.320 --> 47:36.800]  Our california standards. I mean that is so hard to do so
[47:37.280 --> 47:42.160]  Test batches get thrown out triple testing by us after his triple tested at the manufacturer
[47:42.640 --> 47:46.160]  Nobody goes to our level because we want to bring you the best quality
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.640]  But also we have a lot of enemies folks in government not a government. We're not stupid
[47:50.800 --> 47:54.640]  So they want to crucify us. It's going to be without sin when it comes to these products
[47:54.640 --> 48:01.440]  I certainly said in my life, and I'm not perfect, but you come to as close to the purest best products as you can get
[48:01.840 --> 48:04.000]  They're so good. We don't have them half the time
[48:04.960 --> 48:06.800]  I mean nobody does that
[48:06.800 --> 48:11.200]  Nobody there's a reason people have dumbed down products full of a bunch of garbage because that's easier
[48:11.840 --> 48:14.000]  And then you put all their money into marketing. We don't do that
[48:14.560 --> 48:19.360]  Our money is on the product in forward's life.com. All right, uh, whether you're listening to us in
[48:19.760 --> 48:21.920]  Rochester, New York on dr. Wolfe stations
[48:21.920 --> 48:26.960]  Whether you're listening to us on mr. Aragorn stations out there in albuquerque, New Mexico
[48:28.000 --> 48:33.840]  I separately want you to become a local sponsor support the local sponsors pay for local newspaper ads internet ads
[48:34.160 --> 48:36.560]  Go on craigslist. Everybody about the local stations
[48:38.080 --> 48:44.400]  Any one of our 180 plus stations across the country and become a sponsor put up a billboard the fight is now the fight is on
[48:44.560 --> 48:48.880]  That's also key to supporting the transmission. So I want to thank you for that. Okay. Let me stop right there
[48:48.880 --> 48:50.880]  Let me start getting into trump
[48:53.280 --> 48:59.760]  Kasek has predicted an open convention for months smug little arrogant creature that he is george soros funded that's been confirmed
[49:00.560 --> 49:04.400]  It's going to be so much fun. He told abc news to steal the vote
[49:05.280 --> 49:07.440]  So he's out acting like it's fun
[49:08.320 --> 49:10.320]  He's out acting like it's a great thing
[49:11.600 --> 49:12.560]  Let's go ahead
[49:12.560 --> 49:16.480]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of that and then we're going to come back and play trump's response
[49:16.480 --> 49:18.880]  But this is hiding the theft of the election
[49:19.600 --> 49:23.440]  Out in the open it's like opening a door and a babysitter is having sex with your 10 year old daughter
[49:23.920 --> 49:26.320]  And you want to beat their brains out and they say it's no big deal
[49:26.560 --> 49:29.360]  This is this is hiding this stuff in plain view. Here it is
[49:29.760 --> 49:35.920]  But I expect that we're going to be gaining momentum picking up delegates and heading into the convention and george
[49:35.920 --> 49:41.680]  Look the strongest. There's two strong things I have going for me. Number one. I beat hillary clinton in virtually every poll
[49:41.680 --> 49:48.560]  I'm the only one that does it on the republican side and secondly when they look at the record when they look at the record of job growth
[49:48.640 --> 49:53.600]  The record of uh of international uh foreign policy knowledge and experience
[49:54.080 --> 49:58.400]  I believe that a convention will look at somebody like me and that's why I think I'm going to be the nominee
[49:58.400 --> 50:01.680]  We just have to keep going and we're going to have an open convention and george
[50:02.320 --> 50:06.640]  You're the guy that gets open conventions. It's going to be so much fun kids will spend less time
[50:06.640 --> 50:12.640]  Focusing on beaver and Kardashian and more more time focusing on how we elect presidents. It'll be so cool
[50:13.360 --> 50:17.840]  This guy has almost no delegates in a indy 500 race
[50:19.200 --> 50:22.000]  He is behind by 400 miles
[50:23.040 --> 50:25.040]  When trump finishes
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.560]  If his card didn't blow up before then but he's he's gone 50 miles. There's 450 miles left
[50:30.560 --> 50:36.160]  Trump is a hundred miles from the finish line. He is 350 miles behind right now
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.200]  Trump is a hundred miles out 200 miles behind him is
[50:42.640 --> 50:44.320]  Cruz
[50:44.320 --> 50:46.320]  And they're all announcing that he's losing
[50:46.880 --> 50:49.920]  I mean trump could slow down to a hundred miles an hour
[50:50.720 --> 50:57.600]  Not 180 and win this race right now, but they're spinning it that no no no winning the indy 500 doesn't mean you get the trophy
[50:57.600 --> 51:05.120]  Are you concerned about the power grid about the new war on the power grid?
[51:05.120 --> 51:09.440]  If so, this will be the most important radio message you will ever hear and the most valuable

[54:46.960 --> 54:48.960]  You like being slaves folks

[54:54.480 --> 54:57.760]  Why shouldn't they ship your jobs to china and get paid off by chinese generals?
[54:59.040 --> 55:05.040]  Why shouldn't foreign leaders tell us we can't have trump aren't we the politically correct nation that bends over when we're told to?
[55:07.760 --> 55:14.160]  Slaves until the end of time. Oh, isn't it cute isn't it sweet?
[55:14.160 --> 55:18.320]  Me i'm not going quietly into the night. What about you?
[55:20.800 --> 55:24.800]  The globalist want countries bankrupt and control they've done it to argentina
[55:24.800 --> 55:29.360]  That's the closest model of the us as wealthy as the us on average or more
[55:29.840 --> 55:35.280]  Until about 65 years ago when they took the country down when the globalists came in and set up the same scams they're doing here
[55:37.040 --> 55:41.360]  Why should you have a country that produces when you could just be megabanks that come in and run the country into the ground?
[55:41.520 --> 55:43.520]  we're going into bondage
[55:43.520 --> 55:45.120]  And now
[55:45.120 --> 55:48.720]  They get up there on tv and go like case it's going to be a lot of fun
[55:50.480 --> 55:57.840]  Let's use not a formula one car analogy of the indy 500. Let's use the Daytona 500 for nascar

[56:05.120 --> 56:07.120]  And second place

[56:09.200 --> 56:13.280]  He is 180 miles behind you. That's where this is looking
[56:14.560 --> 56:16.560]  Maybe 200 miles case it is
[56:17.520 --> 56:19.520]  375 miles if he does well

[56:25.360 --> 56:27.840]  They've never done something like this before
[56:28.800 --> 56:33.360]  But they're selling hoping we're ignorant going of course your popular vote doesn't count silly
[56:35.760 --> 56:37.520]  Silly kids
[56:37.520 --> 56:44.640]  Votes aren't for voting all the media making billions of dollars off the ratings and washing in the debates and you choose
[56:45.040 --> 56:48.400]  Your vote and oh, this state goes to trump. This state goes to
[56:48.960 --> 56:52.640]  Texas goes to cruise. Oh does trump come take his delegates? Oh, no, no, no
[56:54.080 --> 56:57.280]  But tennessee goes to trump and the state goes to cruise
[56:57.680 --> 57:01.840]  Louisiana goes to trump. It goes to cruise. Arizona goes to trump goes to cruise
[57:01.840 --> 57:07.760]  And cruise gets up there and talks slower and slower like obama now and goes
[57:09.040 --> 57:13.040]  You know, I've got jeb bush supporting me now. He's like trying to act like
[57:13.840 --> 57:16.320]  John wane or something. It's this fake manly thing they do
[57:17.920 --> 57:23.280]  Well, you know, I've got the republicans behind me now jeb bush and others and

[58:00.800 --> 58:04.400]  It's in the bush bank account. It's in the bank account
[58:05.440 --> 58:08.880]  And he heard that johnny cash song. He's in the jailhouse now
[58:09.280 --> 58:13.360]  He's in the jailhouse now not the jailhouse. He's in the banker house now
[58:13.760 --> 58:19.760]  With the big giant rooms full of gold and diamonds and art and rubies. That's where it all went to these guys and they run the country

[59:50.880 --> 59:53.600]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.680]  From his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.360]  It's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:19.120]  So john casick who almost has no delegates like i said if he was in the daytona
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.160]  Speedway, you know race he would
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.040]  He'd be like maybe a hundred miles at the end of the race into it
[01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.720]  With uh trump at 500 ted Cruz at 300 or so
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:37.360]  And they're just trying to spin the idea that all this is okay, and then trump responded to that as ted Cruz
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:43.840]  Comes out and they say is set to win arizona. You know weeks ago trump won's by a huge percentage doesn't matter
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:51.360]  Because the republican establishment already had the quote super delegates in there so they bring the delegates together and then they just say okay
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.360]  Well, we're gonna go for cruise now
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.960]  and then
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.960]  cnn msnbc they all ask
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:05.520]  Why do we even have elections then and they go that's a good good good question just permanent rule like china by the
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.520]  Interparty they appoint their successors
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.880]  And then they even have msnbc and others acting like i'm a cuck there were
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.720]  I don't want to exaggerate. I saw 10 articles in buzzfeed and alternat and
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.200]  Y'all all the usual media matters all the usual suspects
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.880]  Basically implying i'm crazy that i don't want them to take it from trump and that it's normal
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.440]  And that i want riots or something with riots
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.000]  That i want riots or something with roger stone
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:43.280]  Oh, how dare i say we're gonna go be at cleveland because they're announcing they're gonna steal it and then protest that can you imagine
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:50.000]  Having our popular vote stolen and we would engage in the first amendment. Oh, I guess that never existed either, right?
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.360]  Just like millions of people millions of people the last 20 years
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.680]  This is going on when i first got on air people bring me the court filings they'd show me mr. Jones
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:08.720]  My mother owned the house when she died. She gave it to me. I've lived there with my wife 10 years around these people on look
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.320]  The deed was paid off in 1972
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.760]  This bank never had a deed
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:18.960]  It's
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:22.560]  Homesteaded under state of texas and they came and they took the house
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:29.200]  It's a fraud mr. Jones. They file fraudulent. They take houses and i'd have these guys in with their lawyers
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.800]  And i'd be reading and i'd show it to my dad i'd show it to lawyers and
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.600]  Lawyers like you don't want to mess with that boy those those courts are yeah when you get into property
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.120]  I'm gonna stay out of that
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.120]  We'd go down to the county tax assessor
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.280]  And an interviewer catch her in the hallway
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.000]  Nailed a well out of spears was her name and we go you're taking old people's houses
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:52.240]  She goes we don't take houses and i'd cut people having their houses taken i go
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:55.040]  Will you sell them on the courthouse steps? She goes we don't do that
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:01.520]  No, we don't mr. Jones, and i go well you're allowing banks to take houses. They don't even have the deed to no we don't
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.960]  And then running down the hall here'd come to swat team
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.360]  They did up against me for bumping into me
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.280]  In fact that's on video my cancer. I want to dig that stuff out
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.400]  Swat team running up bumping into me
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.240]  And then i would go up in their office and preach out a couple times and then by the end of it
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.680]  They were apologized and then of course though they fired to have the swat team
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.680]  That's brought in somebody else
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.720]  But who knows he might be a nice guy one time i was eating in the cafeteria by myself and the
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.640]  Travis county swat team head guy came over and goes, Alex, how you doing talking to me?
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.480]  I was just like whatever man. I don't want your job. That's all i know
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:40.880]  Anyways, i don't mean to digress. Let's go to this donald trump clip responding to case that here it is
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.440]  Why is a guy allowed to run?
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.160]  All he's doing is just he goes from place to place and loses and he keeps running
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:53.120]  Well, why doesn't mark a rubio do that? Why doesn't jebush do that? Why didn't all of them do that?
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:59.360]  After it was their time now if he wants to go and have his name put in nomination in the conventions in the convention
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:02.480]  He can do that. He doesn't have to run and take my votes
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:06.720]  Because he's taking my votes. He's not taking cruiser's votes. He's taking my votes
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.640]  And again, that's that trump doing an impromptu cafe tv interview
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.040]  I love the fact that i'll just randomly let some lady or guy with an i-thode interview him for two minutes
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:20.480]  I mean that's a really positive positive positive thing about trump
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.040]  Look at this headline and i've told folks about this is i've read about it
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:25.200]  i've experienced and i've seen it down there at the guatemal and border but
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.800]  mexico tortures migrat citizens in effort to slow
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:35.040]  Central american surge they actually give you six months to a year hard labor and they torture you
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.480]  Mexico says we've got to let everybody in
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.160]  Hey, i'm all for letting folks in they just can't get babies paid for for free and stuff
[01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.760]  i mean mexico doesn't let you do that china doesn't let you do that but see
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.760]  You got

[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:43.760]  Entitled digging through the bulls is written by donald trump senior advisor barry bennett who said the mainstream media in washington establishment are working together like never before to bash the trump campaign as the networks have labeled last week the worst week ever for donald trump and they are proclaiming that the end is near for his presidential campaign the memo goes on to point out the disconnect between trump's rising popularity and the media talking about the

[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:16.760]  Ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:36.760]  Lick memo reveals how the Donald Trump campaign really feels about mainstream media and the government we're going to be breaking that down in this hour we also have a lot of really really big reports out there that we're going to be going over dealing with this so-called
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:51.760]  Biggest wiki leaks style data dump ever when I first saw this yesterday I said it's going to be low level groups trying to protect their money it's going to be the Russian networks as soon as I saw that they were going after that soccer that international football group
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:09:10.760]  This is the big mega banks that control trillions that create trillions and derivatives that engage in all forms of drug dealing money laundering child kidnapping white slavery overthrow governments five billion to overthrow Ukraine five billion to the rebels in Syria
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:28.760]  This is the most corrupt group you can imagine simply leaking this to the Germans handing it out to 100 different newspapers or more in the last year to quote vet it know that was to make sure that it didn't connect to any western operations and to cherry pick what to go after
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:41.760]  And sure enough it's in the news today they're saying this is a selective leak by the West against other networks they don't control this is how it works you get Arthur Anderson previously or now it's another big accounting firm that the former attorney general runs
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:55.760]  Then you can have offshore accounts then you cannot pay taxes they certify it and the government doesn't touch it because it's full of vice presidents former presidents on their boards former attorney generals former FBI directors
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:07.760]  There's only two or three of these firms in DC like Arthur Anderson and then you're left alone now the law says you can have an offshore bank account the law says you can go to the Cayman Islands or Switzerland or Luxembourg
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:21.760]  But when they want to they will come and shake you down and arrest you this is a model of global government where you have the FBI going out and arresting the leadership of the International Football League of the International Soccer League
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:30.760]  This is global governance and I'm going to go over that later in the hour with our guest and get his view on it because he's an expert on people going offshore and more
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:37.760]  But WikiLeaks reveals IMF plan to cause a credit event in Greece and destabilize Europe don't forget that
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:52.760]  The French elite where it went wrong financial time submitting they don't pay taxes themselves French billionaire to salt to face trial for tax fraud Chinese newspaper editor resigns over media control Associated Press will have fully cooperated with the Nazis to show how they're controlled
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:11:06.760]  Top German journalist admits mainstream media is completely fake. We quote all live for the CIA in Germany. It's a whole bunch of their biggest reporters coming out. Why is that important because when it comes out of Germany particularly
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:23.760]  People see Germany is like oh modern liberal you can really trust it. It's the worst garbage you'll ever find some of their news is accurate if you research it but but general scandal news is really coming out of the CIA out of the
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:32.760]  MI6 out of Israel out of other groups but they fence it through Germany because somehow they have credibility they never got over being occupied
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:45.760]  High earners say goodbye to France so again they want this international tax grab tax traders widen division in belt tightening France and now they're trying to blame Russia for $2 billion in the quote
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:57.760]  Biggest scandal ever with this Panama data dump the Panama papers 2 billion I mean that is nothing you know how many trillions exchange hands in the currency markets every day
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:12.760]  The rig stock markets the rig credit default swaps the rigged currency the the the rigged interest rates the all of it is it's it they admit it's all rigged is what's crazy just like they've tried to steal elections they manipulated
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:28.760]  them before but never come right out and said we're going to put Paul Ryan in this is Carl Rove last week even if he doesn't have one delegate and case it is showing his where saying you know doesn't matter if he's only got a few he deserves to win
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:44.760]  I don't know what you call this coming out in the open is this really the fall of America the fall of the West or is this a psi up to prepare us for just anything because when things get this crazy in history you go over the edge of a cliff are we going over the edge of the
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:58.760]  cliff right now have we reached the event horizon we're going to talk geopolitics we're going to talk Syria we're going to talk Iran we're going to talk Ukraine we're going to talk Obama we're going to talk black lives matter on the destabilization program
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:14.760]  we're going to talk the entire waterfront 2016 and beyond but first off I don't know his view I follow his articles but he's pretty libertarian conservative a political though he just does analysis of the world bestselling nonfiction author bestselling fiction
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:30.760]  author James was he rolls is American novelist and blogger who is best known for his recently completed Patriots novel series rolls the former US Army intelligence officer he is the founder of the senior editor of survival blog.com which is one of the top sites in the world with
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:44.760]  millions of visitors a month for the past 10 years he's covered survival and preparedness topics from a constitutional Christian libertarian perspective his latest novel is titled land of promise got another one coming out to the first book and the counter caliphate
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:56.760]  Chronicle series this novel set two decades in the future describes the establishment of a Christian nation under siege now I could do three hours with this guy because I got a lot to say a lot of angles of cover he's only on to the bottom of the next
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:10.760]  back in a few weeks for a part two for two full hours because he was willing to do it today he's a busy guy because I've got my reporters popping in for the last 30 minutes the next hour I may push them though up to David Knight though we'll see how this goes but
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:24.760]  I just throughout that menu of what I want to cover but front and center is what is this caliphate plan why would the West be bold enough to bring in 5 million people they know many of which are middle military aged men and our jihadis
[01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:38.760]  still they carry out attacks and then martial law comes in like areas of Europe have already done and how are our political elite get away with bringing them in and then having them attack us is that part of this victory over logic and common sense
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:56.760]  just like in effect they're suspending the election by stealing Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump's delegates openly I mean we're really entering a new phase is this bravada is this arrogance is this megalomania or is this a desperate attempt to look confident I've thrown out a lot there
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:07.760]  James Wesley Rawls survival blog.com we're going to break here in about 15 minutes you've got the floor tell us where you want to start first and what you think is currently happening
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:33.760]  well Alex I think looking at it from a 30,000 foot view what we have in the global geopolitical realm is with the end of the cold war the powers that be needed to have a continued destabilization as an excuse for carrying on with all of their banking shenanigans
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:53.760]  their massive military buildups and so forth they in effect through Osama bin Laden and other Islamic leaders that they supported the CIA and some created ISIS as you pointed out many times
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:16:14.760]  they want destabilization they are hoping that they can walk the tightrope of destabilization to the point where they can continue to consolidate power with massively centralized government with a electronic currency replacing
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:33.760]  physical currency and with the whole status agenda by building up the Islamic threat and then hoping to encounter that threat all the time accumulating more power and wealth for themselves
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:49.760]  but what I'm afraid is going to happen is that they are going to over destabilize and they will in effect create their own downfall and perhaps the downfall of all the western nations in the process
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:17:07.760]  they are hoping that they can kind of lock that tightrope and carry on year after year after year but I'm afraid it's going to come back and blow up in their face because a lot of these terrorist groups that they have created
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:29.760]  don't have any compunctions at all against using true weapons of mass destruction so that Wall Street itself may be the next ground zero and the best laid plans of these totalitarian one of these is going to come back and halt them
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:43.760]  well you just crystallized it perfectly I want you to continue but I just want to back up sir what you were just saying obviously I know you're retired you talked a lot of your sources in government I have amazing sources high level in government but also out
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:59.760]  people say well I mean how do you do that they're going for whistleblowers things are so bad now that mainly the US Army strangely enough that's just a historical one of the oldest institutions in this country has been the main group inside the Pentagon saying no to Syria no to all these events no to double
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:15.760]  crossing Egypt and they are basically telling the neocons the left and the socialists you better stop it and there's such a socialist vein in this godless atheist neural order culture that really the only ideology they have is destroy the better
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:31.760]  destroy the farms collectivize everything under corporate control you know type of high tech fascist great leap forward not communist but fascist more like and that they're blowing the engine that made the globalist have a major command base
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:45.760]  and that the military not even because the top brass and statisticians are angels but because they want to keep playing golf and don't want their grandkids killed they're saying stop it right now you're about to bring civilization down by crisis
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:59.760]  creation because you keep getting more power out of crises but at a certain point this black hole is going to swallow you now that message you just kind of threw out is the message I've been getting for about six years from high level Pentagon people and others that obviously use this show as a conduit to
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:15.760]  warn people but now even down to low level enlisted officers they know the military basically has been warned about 90% of the armies on board about 60% of Marines are on board about 60% of the Navy knows what's going on for whatever reason the Navy is not doing too good waking up
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:31.760]  that's just kind of a dead reckoning number but this is really a big deal where you almost have a Mexican standoff between institutions in our government newer more corrupt private contractor institutions and delusional people like Hillary and Samantha Powers and Obama
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:42.760]  who have no idea what they're doing and watch Sports Center all day at least Hitler was in a bunker when he was endangering his whole country and doing super dangerous stuff and knew he could lose and had been in the military
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:50.760]  and these people are completely out of their minds and it really is frightening to see them not knowing what they're doing and is that what you're basically coming down to
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:20:14.760]  yes I agree with you Alex that there is a level of self delusion that now exists amongst the powers that be that's unprecedented and the their level of control over the economy over the stock markets manipulating the derivatives market manipulating the precious metals market which is a very thin market
[01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:26.760]  the level of control they have is frightening and again it's likely to come back and blow up in their faces and it's the law of unintended consequences so
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:45.760]  for many years you've talked about the Hegelian dialectic and it's been employed heavily for the last seven years under the Obama administration and my fear is that regardless of who comes in in the next administration
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:21:01.760]  we're probably going to see a statist of some sort who's going to want to continue playing the same game playing the same political games playing pressure groups off of one another
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:18.760]  trying to increase divisiveness within our own country by bringing in almost uncontrolled immigration of Islamists who are not going to be properly vetted at all
[01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:42.760]  and in fact right now there seems to be a preference within the US State Department to bring in Islamists rather than persecuted Christians so what does that tell us it tells us that they want a lack of stability they want to put people at odds with one another
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:22:04.760]  to create friction and out of that friction their you know it's a Hegelian dialectic again they create the crisis and out of that crisis comes their solution which is all stage managed to fill their coffers and build political power
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:19.760]  and then under their agenda 21 depopulation program they codify the cosmology of us being poor and them being rich as their guardians getting rid of the scourge of humanity all perfectly scripted where they play savior of the earth
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:41.760]  while they literally block industrialization block systems that would set up a two child family with all the actuaries we know that lead towards stabilization global prosperity and a new Renaissance and they themselves going back even to Bertrand Russell
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:56.760]  and the nonfiction books of a she wells and Galton all the rest of them admit 100 years ago that they were going to have to block a new Renaissance and quote kill a lot of beautiful and gallon gallon people to quote a she wells to get their new world order
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:16.760]  and even wrote the book and had the movie things to come the movie came out in the early 30s where they set up a world government run by a UN that flies around in giant B2 style bombers actually shows B2 bombers nerve gassing nation states and taking the guns from the people and depopulating the planet
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:29.760]  I mean these people are completely out of their minds but the thing is they've got control because the British Empire got behind them and funded this wild dream and Mr Rawls looks like they're pretty much getting there do you think they'll succeed
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:50.760]  it seems like it you mentioned a she wells and things to come he was a socialist but he was very prescient about what might happen and you'll notice that in this in the storyline of things to come the way that they were able to create their global governance was out of the the
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:24:02.760]  aftermath of a global socio economic collapse following war after war after war it looks a lot like what we're seeing right now
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:19.760]  and that's why his boss as you know if I can look this up the letters the writings are public the man that basically took the British Empire and folded it into the US Empire Cecil Rhodes and the Rhodes scholars envision the whole plan we're currently living under
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:42.760]  yeah and if the ironically the the legacy of Cecil Rhodes was is now being protested in South Africa they don't want anything to do with with any of the colonialist
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:25:02.760]  any of that history they wanted their take their literally tearing down statues in as in South Africa at the universities right now Cecil Rhodes really had had a view not just for the African continent not just as they said in those days Cape to Cairo
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:28.760]  but for the whole world and his a lot of his protege's ended up creating organizations like the CFR and the trilateral commission and so forth years later it's all been an almost uninterrupted chain of this quest for global dominance global control and they
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:49.760]  they very wisely co-opted the educational system the mass media and the banking system and let's be clear no further again that you're getting the inside scooper listeners Cecil Rhodes all the rest of it they even said and he wrote you can read it 100 years ago we will then even finally get rid of the
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:26:04.760]  trappings of the empire the flags the statues the parades the uniforms and it'll be invisible through our corporate interlocking directorates like the Royal Institute of International Affairs the council on farm relations and it'll be multinational and now that's why at at Oxford
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:23.760]  in places they're supporting you know pulling down bust of the Queen and that's why Obama sent back the bust of Churchill is because they're going to even let the socialists and leftist pull that down and believe they've defeated it when they've actually are helping it bring in the next phase the end of free speech
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:50.760]  I mean these folks are so sophisticated it is indeed and it's it's a a it's worth mentioning that 20 years ago the socialists in England turned their own flag the Union Jack into a supposed symbol of racism and colonialism
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:27:15.760]  and they declared that the Union Jack couldn't be used in political rallies and protests that's right the fact the police are arresting right that was 20 years ago and at the time I was in shock and disbelief that that could happen but right now in America we're on the verge of that happening with our own American flag
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:27.760]  exactly they start with the rebel battle flag it doesn't do with slavery but ignorant people are told so so what if some toothless races drive around whether it's not what it symbolizes and then now they want the American flag and to expand on that
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:48.760]  it's that was only one symbol of empire the globalists have conquered the Rothschild's others have conquered England they're using that model and the people they use to enforce it upon the world it's moved on from England it's still based there to a certain extent but now they're demonizing anything western when it's England that ended slavery worldwide
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:28:06.760]  it's England that brought forward the abolitionist movement and now in the ultimate victory while slavery goes on in more than 10 Muslim nations today and women are slaves and hundreds of nations it's okay because the greatest evil on earth is England where we got Magna Carta and the beginning of the Renaissance
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:30.760]  you're so right Alex it's it's just almost a sweet irony to see that the the symbols of what really stand for freedom are being stood on their head and the institutions that really stand for individual liberty are being denigrated
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:40.760]  well everything that represents statism control collectivism socialism
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:51.760]  are being lifted up by people like the Obama administration by all the socialists of Europe and so forth
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:29:07.760]  right now we are living in what I refer to as the age of deception and betrayal where our basic institutions are that anything that stands for freedom is being cast in a bad light

[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:19.760]  a leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment an internal memo leaked to the Washington Post reveals the level of disdain that Trump has for the political establishment and their talking heads in the mainstream media the memo entitled digging through the bulls is written by
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:39.760]  Donald Trump senior advisor Barry Bennett who said the mainstream media in Washington establishment are working together like never before to bash the Trump campaign as the networks have labeled last week the worst week ever for Donald Trump and they are proclaiming that the end is near for his presidential campaign
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:58.760]  the memo goes on to point out the disconnect between Trump's rising popularity and the media talking points another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates and causes you can learn more right now at info wars dot com

[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:16.760]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:33.760]  they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:48.760]  i personally counter this onslaught with anthroplex anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body

[01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:15.760]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:21.760]  never look at it listen to her howl and go

[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:47.760]  ladies and gentlemen i don't get up here and say all these things have a sensational show believe me reality is sensation reality is dangerous it's crazy it's real and i never imagined 21 years ago going on air local access and local radio i'd be here with tens of millions of people every week conservatively
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:59.760]  it's way more than that it's ridiculous tuning in all over the world but the good news is the facts we're covering are what the real insiders good and bad know what's going on
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:08.760]  the elite have been so arrogant for decades they've admitted so much of their plan so their own people could understand it thinking you'd never go look it up
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:21.760]  they've been making preparations to resist to slow this down it's over 15 years behind most experts agree but now they're accelerating we're going to talk to mr. Rawls about where this system of betrayal is going
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:30.760]  the caliphate they're setting up clearly the elite are allied with radical Islam turning it loose to take over the rest of Islam and to bring it into our countries that that's happening
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:41.760]  it's one area i underestimated it's so bold it's so over the top that i would hear people like rawls saying this 10 years ago and i thought yeah i could see that down the road but you know not in 1020 years well it's happening quicker
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:56.760]  so i gotta say that we're going to really be focusing on this a lot obviously before i go any further the soils as you know are depleted in most areas so a lot of the food you eat a lot of the vegetables you eat just don't have the trace elements all the different vitamins and minerals you need

[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.760]  We're going to talk about preparedness with Mr Rawls as well coming up survival blog dot com.
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:28.760]  Again formerly with army intelligence and of course nobody in the army ever brags about the stuff they did but I ran into a colonel.
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:39.760]  And then to another lieutenant colonel that we talked to and then I ran into another gentleman who I met before but looked up he's in civilian life now developing stuff.
[01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:47.760]  For different agencies and he told me his name and gave me his card I forget it's at home but but.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:55.760]  I was out the court I was taking care of something and he was saying oh you know Rawls used to work for me as a great guy so that three different people who tune into the show.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:39:02.760]  You're just talking about the great stuff Mr Rawls has done for America which which we'll never hear about you know the quiet professionals but he just really knows what he's talking about.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:13.760]  And we love having him on I want to get into the caliphate your latest novel which is a smart way to educate people obviously they seem to listen to stuff that's fiction even though it's real versus stuff that's real they seem to ignore it.
[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:21.760]  But we'll talk about that as well but survival the economy where you think Obama's going the rest of it but.
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:33.760]  As we went to break Mr Rawls you brought up the situation with the age of deception the age of betrayal is this the beginning of the fall.
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:41.760]  Why are they so naked now what do you think of Donald Trump why are they so scared of him because quite frankly I didn't trust him a year ago.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:53.760]  He's involved in casinos and things and I'm not into really being super flashy it kind of turns me off but but at the same time he was against him get 20 years ago he is a nationalist I know people that know him.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:40:04.760]  Before he ever ran for office that said oh you didn't know Donald Trump's anti New World Order and so all this click for me about six seven months ago that they're scared of him for some reason.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:21.760]  This couldn't be a foil this couldn't be a double cross could it but I want your real view on that as well but let's get into the age of betrayal the age of deception where you think the world is right now and then into this election and and into the caliphate.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:39.760]  Well Alex I think that Donald Trump I think is popular because he represents at least an outsider to the political system and people are definitely fed up with insider after insider after insider being offered up as as candidates.
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:51.760]  And while I don't think Donald Trump is a perfect candidate I think that he at least resonates with a lot of people as representing.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:41:14.760]  Old school American nationalism national sovereignty and as a counterbalance to the forces of international banking. Now unfortunately he he has some compromises in his in his background that make him kind of suspect.
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:33.760]  Because of the actually connections to the Clintons of all people and his many business connections with the bankers so I find it really difficult to believe that he's a true outsider but he certainly represents more of an outsider.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:52.760]  And then certainly the Hillary or Sanders. Let me ask you this and the all hands on deck scenario and I agree with what you just said the all hands deck scenario from the communist Chinese government the Mexican government the former president the British government to the pope to you name it coming every
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:42:06.760]  every newspaper coming out against him. I see real hysteria and real hate and real concern and the big billionaires getting together and given hundreds of millions to beat him. I see that as them legitimately hitting the panic button because they see the nationalism he's saying
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:20.760]  even if he's not really a good guy is irrevocable damage to them but it also shows how arrogant they are to think we can have all these foreign governments lecture us how deep into globalist colonialism we really are.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:40.760]  Yeah, the the amount of victory all that's being directed against him is evidence that the powers that be are feeling very nervous very anxious that they're losing control of the political process because for years and years we've had
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:58.760]  political party a versus political party B and low and behold the candidates for both of those parties have been insiders they've all been CFR or trilateral commission related individuals.
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:18.760]  Every time we we've been given a so called choice on the ballot that really isn't a choice is either political insider a or political insider B and for them to see Trump on the horizon is truly truly frightening to them to see anything outside of their
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:32.760]  stage managed operation we're seeing a de facto response to populism whether he be real or not it's kind of like you know putting up a fake owl to scare away crows they just see an owl and are upset they don't know if it's real or not they're
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.760]  trying to figure out of its real but it scares them.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:52.760]  Yes, that's that's essentially it the the the folks that want to control the the whole the whole game really they want to control us economically politically in every at every sphere basically.
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:44:06.760]  Look at people like Donald Trump as wildcards and because they're out he's outside of their control he's and he is unpredictable.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:12.760]  It really throws a monkey wrench into their plans do you think he realizes how much danger he's in.
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:23.760]  Probably not anyone who goes up against Hillary Clinton ought to be really really worried.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:47.760]  At body temperature to the to the election, I would say are actually fairly small. I would not be surprised to see that he mysteriously dies of an aneurysm or a heart attack or or or you know something anything but his the chances of him making the election I think are small.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:58.760]  If if he's truly is the threat that they think he is. Have you ever in your decades of being politically involved 30 years or so since you got on the army have you ever.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:06.760]  Mr Rawls James Jose Rawls survival blog.com joining us from the top most respected survivalist and global security experts out there.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:17.760]  The general public with the Pentagon you name it everybody really respects him and I know. Have you ever seen a more dangerous time not just for America but the world I mean this is just for me looking at this is unprecedented.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:21.760]  The amount of dominoes lined up the amount of triggers being thrown.
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:29.760]  The elite scurrying around building armored redoubts I mean government all over the world is acting like something big is coming.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:37.760]  It's truly unprecedented because if you look at the mountain of debt and the scale of the derivatives that have built up.
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.760]  That's one huge threat.
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:49.760]  And meanwhile geopolitically we see a regional war in Syria that could very well blow up in World War three and we see tension in the sites in the South China
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:46:02.760]  that could very well blow up into another world war. We are truly in uncharted waters here. We have a situation that where the global economy is teetering on the brink.
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:13.760]  We have the central banks are right now in the process of going to sub zero interest rates which is an absolute panic move.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:21.760]  They have basically run out of ammunition in the economic that's like injecting adrenaline directly into the heart.
[01:46:21.760 --> 01:46:38.760]  Yeah I think that at this at this point we are teetering on the brink of either economic collapse or global war as as kind of the final option for the insiders to have their way.
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:43.760]  Because without either of those we're just simply going to see the truth come out.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:57.760]  What's happened with the Panama Papers I think is just one's little glimpse of the extent of the international financial web that exists.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:05.760]  Well from what I've seen it looks like it's a Western attempt to just go after Putin and certainly Putin's involved in a bunch of stuff but it seems selective to some mid level networks.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:20.760]  It's highly selective yes. And if you'll notice they're mainly pointing the pointing the finger at African dictators for example with these these trust arrangements with you know bearer want bearer number.
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:24.760]  Number one or bearer number two for example.
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:43.760]  As the beneficiaries the serious money the big money is being traded in the hot markets every day it's not these these tiny little you know I say relatively tiny these billion dollar trusts that are being set up by the.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:57.760]  And to benefit that the children of Middle Eastern and African dictators are small change compared to the trillions of dollars that are that are flowing internationally.
[01:47:57.760 --> 01:48:09.760]  The manipulation is going on in the currency markets the you mentioned earlier credit default swaps people have no idea about the the scope of the derivatives trading that goes on.
[01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:28.760]  A CDS a credit default swap is a form of derivative and that is so well refined as a derivative that a movement as small as one tenth of one percent of an interest rate.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:46.760]  Can put a major shock wave through the system and unfortunately the way this derivatives casino has built up it's so finely tuned that when a big swing does happen where interest rates move a whole percentage point or two percentage points it's going to absolutely collapse the system.
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:49.760]  Well James I want to talk triggers with you I want to get into caliphate.
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:58.760]  I just want to go ahead I'm going to have you through the whole next hour we're going to have reporters on in the fourth hour with David 90 is another guest popping in as well but looking at this.
[01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:10.760]  Here's a telegraph article China jitters to trigger global market bloodbath IMF warrants I love how the very progenitors of this whole scam warn us and then you know the former head of the Fed that helped give us the derivatives with Clinton.
[01:49:10.760 --> 01:49:20.760]  Greenspan warns us of irrational exuberance is like selling a kid a bag full of crack and giving him a pipe and saying look out this might be addicting but it's.
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:28.760]  Just amazing but but getting back to things I see as problems that nobody talks about it and I'm not bragging when I say.
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:43.760]  One thing that launched our show on the nose to me like 19 years ago as I put out some police state films show in the military training for gun conversation and things domestically and then the army and Marines said don't watch out shows videos and don't go to his website.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:49.760]  Well that meant I suddenly had this huge audience of the military tune in what was the establishment thinking.
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:58.760]  My audience probably quadrupled overnight when they started doing that that actually launched us was them saying don't go here so they seem like they're smart but they also seem like they're dumb.
[01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:10.760]  Now I was totally unpolished them still aren't but but knew more than the average person so the show got very popular I became a source because then all these people sort of giving me stuff because nobody else would would talk about it.
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:22.760]  Here we are 20 years later and the military listens to the show foreign governments listen to it they listen to others like it but shows how bad the rest of media is is that we're some of the you know best it's out there I'm not bragging.
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:34.760]  But to know that most the military is aware of what's going on says they're not going to go along with the globalist takeover that's got a really cause a problem and I'm not saying I'm behind this I'm one small part of it but I'm.
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:48.760]  A gauge because I interface with these people on the street you name it so I know how awake they are does the establishment realize that they still currently say don't go to infowars dot com and don't go to your site and a bunch of others as you know.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:58.760]  Don't they understand that's backfiring with the Streisand effect squared we'll be back with James Wesley Rawls survival blog dot com I'm Alex Jones with the answer.

[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:26.760]  Okay we're going to get back to that point that Mr. Rawls got cut off on as we went to break where I was asking the question about the military.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:34.760]  And I'm not branding them as the heroes or anything these are people that have actually been in the real world on average they know about the corruption they know about the system.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:41.760]  And that's always been the problem of dictators or oligarchies is the security services turning against them and look at Operation Valkyrie and Hitler.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:45.760]  The problem is this is an oligarchy it's a whole bunch of people it's not one guy.
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:48.760]  So we're going to talk about that briefly start the next hour but here's an example.
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:50.760]  I get up Saturday.
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:56.760]  I'll see a headline Muslim woman run over by right wing nationalist in Molan beat.
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:02.760]  And I read the article from the Daily Mail and it never says who they are they've been caught.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.760]  That doesn't sound right that sounds like a false flag because the radical Muslims are experts at this.
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:13.760]  She runs out and it looks staged and jumps in front of the car.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.760]  Just like they you know stage the dead baby on the beach in Greece and all that.
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:28.760]  I go to the comments everybody's mad thinking we're the ones saying this will go to our go to our info wars and I'll show you horrific moment Muslim woman is mowed down by grinning driver who then stops to take picture.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:34.760]  Oh they changed the headline look when this came out now.
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:44.760]  Right Bart Molan big far right hit and run was Muslim on Muslim attack.
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:55.760]  A local drunk youth named Muhammad it hit and run by Muslim woman and Molan big this week blamed on far right anti-Islam administrators was in fact perpetrated by an allegedly drunk local youth named Muhammad.
[01:55:55.760 --> 01:56:03.760]  So I don't mean to just divert off but it's this constant lying and then saying German men rape the women in Cologne and all this.
[01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:08.760]  They're almost all military age men they invaded Syria they're coming in.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:16.760]  Now Europe's bringing in we're going to talk about that at the start of the next hour with Mr Rawls but the time we have sir in the short segment getting back to you in the next four minutes.
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:30.760]  Specifically with my military question what are they thinking when they say don't visit Patriot sides don't you know George Washington's bad the founding fathers are bad they actually as you know teach the military that that's actually woken the military up.
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:32.760]  What are the globalist thinking.
[01:56:32.760 --> 01:56:46.760]  Well they're hoping that they can control the military but the problem is even with a dumb down electorate dumb down populace that's reaching military age.
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:54.760]  Even with that people still have basic common sense and they can see what's going on in the world around them.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:57:03.760]  They get curious they now turn to the Internet it used to be newsletters and magazines and that sort of thing but they turn to the Internet to seek the truth.
[01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:20.760]  And they're hoping that they can control access to that knowledge to keep that knowledge out of the hands of the people that they want to have as their foot soldiers.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:33.760]  It's not working they tried firewalling more than a thousand Patriot websites at the Pentagon two years ago and there was a quiet rebellion that went on.
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:42.760]  Where first people were saying well you can't firewall us or if you firewall us only firewall us.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:52.760]  Firewall us during working hours but we want to have unlimited Internet access before working hours on our lunch hour and after work.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:58:05.760]  And the IT staff at the Pentagon back down they actually relented because there was such there were so many people at the Pentagon that were upset about.
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:12.760]  And that's what I'm getting at. Don't they understand that when they tried to blacklist you and myself and others that just made everybody come check out what we're saying.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:15.760]  They hear we're telling the truth and it backfired didn't it.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:34.760]  What happened was people were using VPN virtual private networks or web surfing from at home or web surfing from wireless networks literally from their mobile devices in the parking lot of the Pentagon.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.760]  This is so exciting. Stay there.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:39.760]  Back in 70 seconds. This is a microcosm of everything.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.760]  They're not invincible folks. The globalist can be defeated if you realize you have the power.
[01:58:44.760 --> 01:59:08.760]  You are the resistance back in 70. Stay with us.

[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:26.760]  It's a changing war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:38.760]  All right, coming up at about 24 after we're going to start opening the phones after the balance of the hour for James Leslie Rawls, our guest also want to hit a bunch of other news items with him and get his get his take on it.
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:47.760]  The toll free number to join us is eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one that was a short segment.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:49.760]  This is a short segment in the long segment.
[02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:59.760]  We're going to get into the caliphate his latest novel and what the next big shoot a drop in his brain is with the man that heads up survival blog dot com James Leslie Rawls.
[02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:04.760]  I'm Alex Jones of info wars dot com and present planet dot com.
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:11.760]  But getting back to what you were just saying, to me, this is key because I used to get mad at police and some of the police state stuff.
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:14.760]  I realize that's what they're being trained to do is we should change it above them.
[02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:16.760]  That's our political job.
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:20.760]  But on average, cops tend to be more awake than the general public.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:26.760]  And I mean, some jurisdictions are very corrupt, but others are pretty good folks overall.
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:31.760]  And so that's why you've got the Black Lives Matter, the UN strong cities initiative coming in to take over.
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:34.760]  I mean, it's actually happening.
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:37.760]  And so we also have the military even more awake.
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:41.760]  So they're saying the number one domestic enemy will be returning veterans and gun owners.
[02:01:41.760 --> 02:01:47.760]  Well, that woke up military training to take on domestic terrorists that are being taught are themselves.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:50.760]  So there's a major disconnect in the elites.
[02:01:50.760 --> 02:01:59.760]  And if they would have disconnects like not realizing when you tell Marines and army troops on bases across the country, don't go to info wars dot com.
[02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:01.760]  That they're all going to go to info wars dot com.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:10.760]  Or when they get up there and bad mount the founders and Christians and gun owners and make the men wear red high heel shoes, that it's not demoralizing them.
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:12.760]  It's turning them against their controllers.
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:19.760]  There's you take a bunch of socialist engineers, give them ROTC merit, give them an officers commission, stick them in the military.
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:22.760]  It's so alien, they've caused the total wake up.
[02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:25.760]  I mean, I really see this as one of the biggest missteps ever.
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.760]  Go ahead, sir, and give me your view on that.
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:41.760]  We are in a situation where the controllers are losing control because there's so many different channels of media now available.
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:44.760]  They basically can't stop the signal.
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:46.760]  The truth is out there.
[02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:59.760]  It's people like you and bloggers and podcasters and journalists, non mainstream journalists that are who are waking people up to the truth.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.760]  And a lot of those people are in military organizations.
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:15.760]  There are people, as I mentioned before, at the Pentagon, for example, people who are on general staff, people who are in military intelligence.
[02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:29.760]  And most people don't realize that there's as many people in military intelligence with the different military services as there are with the CIA and the NSA and the NRO, for example.
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:38.760]  And there is from my sources, I'm not saying they're perfectly good, but the army groups and others are basically battling the foreign interests that have come in and taken over the CIA.
[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:50.760]  And there's been a decades-long war now emerging where more and more army officers are even able to go on air now and actively bad-mount the corrupt system, which, for folks that don't know, is basically mutiny.
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:54.760]  But it's not mutiny because the military realizes the country's now been captured.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:55.760]  Right.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:04.760]  There's definitely different competing camps within the intelligence agencies and within the military.
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:21.760]  A lot of the really conservative libertarian and freedom-minded general officers were purged during the seven years of the Obama administration.
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:35.760]  But there's still a lot of people in the enlisted ranks, warrant officers, junior officers that up into the field-grade officers who have a concept of American liberty.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.760]  And they cannot quench that.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.760]  They can't.
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:39.760]  They can't.
[02:04:39.760 --> 02:04:42.760]  They just can't put that fire out.
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:43.760]  This is the key to everything.
[02:04:43.760 --> 02:04:44.760]  Stay there.
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:45.760]  I want you to come back and speak to this at length.
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:47.760]  Then get into the caliphate, survivalblog.com.
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:48.760]  This is the key.
[02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:55.760]  They've already decapitated the federal government brought in their operatives, but the people that actually run the military are still there and they're awake now.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:57.760]  This is a key time.
[02:04:57.760 --> 02:05:22.760]  A leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment.
[02:05:22.760 --> 02:05:29.760]  This is something that the mainstream media and Washington establishment are working together like never before to bash the Trump campaign.
[02:05:29.760 --> 02:05:34.760]  As the networks have labeled last week the worst week ever for Donald Trump.
[02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:39.760]  And they are proclaiming that the end is near for his presidential campaign.
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:46.760]  The memo goes on to point out the disconnect between Trump's rising popularity and the media talking points.
[02:05:46.760 --> 02:05:54.760]  Another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates and causes.
[02:05:54.760 --> 02:06:23.760]  You can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:30.760]  We drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple-blue crystals to extract the ultra-pure iodine.

[02:06:37.760 --> 02:06:41.760]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield, nascent iodine,
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:50.760]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.

[02:07:57.760 --> 02:08:17.760]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:30.760]  About 160 years ago, 165 years ago, the British Crown was having trouble expanding and maintaining its empire.
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:35.760]  So they financed their top side. This is all in books that have been published at the time and since then.
[02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:38.760]  They come up with social engineering and social control.
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:48.760]  And to develop machines that can track and trace everyone, and to develop cultural systems of what they called mind war.
[02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:55.760]  That was actually a British term, and then it was picked up by the Germans. It's what they called Psiops or psychological warfare.
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:09:02.760]  But what happens when people in the end game realize that they're the target of it as well?
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:05.760]  You see, globalism isn't just taken over because it's a better system.
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:10.760]  That would just take over by adoption, free market.
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:16.760]  It's taking over to end all competition. It's taking over to end the family, to end our culture as you know it.
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:19.760]  Go read the book, things to come.
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:25.760]  Go see what the head of the Fabian Socialist said they were going to do.
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:28.760]  He wrote more nonfiction books than he wrote fiction.
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:32.760]  I've probably read seven or eight nonfiction books by H.G. Welleson.
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:37.760]  I'll be honest, I can't read any more of them. I used to read all their books and stuff and Carol quickly.
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:44.760]  And I've already know their plan. It's really scary to actually read them saying it and licking their lips and stuff.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:47.760]  Folks, these people really don't like you, okay?
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:59.760]  And you need to understand they're the same people that used the people of Ireland and Scotland and England who were strong to build their world tyranny.
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:06.760]  They were colonialized by the Romanian and Habsburg, who weren't even really German,
[02:10:06.760 --> 02:10:14.760]  criminals that had learned how to control the final spice trade coming in out of the Middle East there in what's Transylvania today.
[02:10:14.760 --> 02:10:18.760]  And they perfected torture and political manipulation and really a lot of bad stuff.
[02:10:18.760 --> 02:10:25.760]  Not that Western Europe was perfect, but they brought all that in, they took over and God help us, man.
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:32.760]  And notice now the West gets the blame for what these people have used us to build for them.
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:35.760]  And they're now moving into their endgame.
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:38.760]  So here in terms of communist fascist socialists, those are all the confusion.
[02:10:38.760 --> 02:10:44.760]  They're different forms of command and control that the elites want because they can manage command and control because it's centralized.
[02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:46.760]  Read, tragedy and hope. We sell the book.
[02:10:46.760 --> 02:10:55.760]  M4warstore.com, back in print, written by this guy that published it so the State Department's own people could understand what they're doing.
[02:10:55.760 --> 02:10:59.760]  We fund communists and fascists and socialists and we want dictators, we don't want freedom.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:10.760]  And it's 1100 page book explaining to them that none of this means anything that we're taking over and that we're the new British Empire and that we know best, so just do it.
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:14.760]  And you'll be taken care of.
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:16.760]  They're so arrogant, they published it.
[02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:19.760]  People actually started reading it though, so they took it out of print.
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:20.760]  That's where this goes.
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:24.760]  James Wesley Rawls and I are not up here giving you our opinion.
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.760]  Do you understand that?
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:31.760]  The thousands of quotes, the statements, the admissions, it's far worse than I can tell you.
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:38.760]  Prince Philip, Prince Charles, constantly talking about how they want to kill everybody and bring in world government to forcibly inoculate you, you know, cancer viruses.
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:43.760]  They mean business.
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:51.760]  And the fact that some whacked out Transylvanian royalty wants a world government to run your life.
[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:56.760]  And they're always, you know what, they're always digging up on the castle properties and the rest of it, little kids.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.760]  I mean, folks, you cannot make up how evil these people are.
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:00.760]  I'm going to stop right there.
[02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:02.760]  But again, it's legends.
[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:04.760]  They're not physical vampires.
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:07.760]  They're a bloodline of psychotics.
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:09.760]  And they're not even running the show.
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.760]  They just kicked off and funded science.
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:16.760]  You know, there was major science in the 1850s, folks.
[02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:18.760]  They focused on the science of control.
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:19.760]  And this has been copied.
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:20.760]  It's been exported.
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:21.760]  It's been refined.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:22.760]  There's all these new systems.
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:23.760]  I'm ranting.
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:24.760]  I'm going to go back to our guest.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:26.760]  You just have to understand what we face.
[02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:38.760]  The terms you want to know is the fact that globalism is really totally corrupt, scientific colonialism by multinational mega banks and institutions.
[02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:45.760]  And institutions that are above the law enter the new royalty with the powered attacks, but are exempt from it.
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:49.760]  Letter of Mark given to their operatives, their mercenaries.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:56.760]  And they're reversing the Western invasion where they'd say, you're going to put on a ship or we're going to kill you.
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:06.760]  I mean, you think it was fun when, you know, like the 1600s, more than half of crews died routinely, usually about a third on an African or South American voyage.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.760]  I think they weren't slaves.
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:16.760]  And the West then tried to end slavery, but within the West was growing this great evil.
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:28.760]  And so now you're facing scientific colonialism at a multinational above the state level, playing the states off against each other.
[02:13:28.760 --> 02:13:30.760]  The individuals against each other.
[02:13:30.760 --> 02:13:48.760]  The great game times a thousand and nested in the heart of this nested in the core of this is then using the giant third world populations with promises of their own colonialism to come to the West and get the free welfare and the free goodies to be
[02:13:48.760 --> 02:13:57.760]  brought here to be programmed with liberation theology, hate the West theology, and then you conquer the third world and the West by playing them off against each other.
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:02.760]  And that is their admitted plan. You have been given the enemy's blueprint. What are you going to do about it?
[02:14:02.760 --> 02:14:06.760]  Now, Mr. Rawls, I'm going to try to shut up and give you the floor now, but I want to set the table here.
[02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:10.760]  Getting back into the military waking up, the bureaucrats waking up.
[02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:19.760]  A lot of people understanding now as we near the end game that the Patriots were right the last 60 plus years from Barry Goldwater up to you and others, warning people.
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:22.760]  And so now how does that affect the battle space?
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:23.760]  Where does this go?
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:34.760]  And why is Islam, as I think you correctly predicted over a decade ago, the secret skeleton key weapon that they're going to use to finish their world government takeover?
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:42.760]  Well, Alex, the goal obviously is control. They want to consolidate power.
[02:14:42.760 --> 02:15:03.760]  They want to institute a global system and all the pieces are in place right now to make that happen with the Internet, with the possibility of going cashless for the world currencies and soon to be just a single currency.
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:16.760]  I think that's definitely their goal. They have this game plan and they are indeed, just as you said, playing one group off of another to make all this happen.
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:33.760]  And as I mentioned at the beginning of the last hour, the real tool that's being used right now following the end of the Cold War is using radical Islam as a pawn.
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:49.760]  And as I mentioned before, I think that that pawn may actually be a knight or a queen in hiding. It's going to turn against them with dramatic results when all is said and done.
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:16:08.760]  We are seeing this all play out and the pace at which change is taking place is getting faster and faster and faster. And they're trying to manipulate this whole game by keeping people in the dark.
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:27.760]  They're failing at that. And at this point, it's going to come down to crisis, whether it's a global pandemic, whether it's a global economic collapse or whether it's a global war, they're going to have to play the crisis card very soon because they basically lost control economically.
[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:34.760]  And they have lost, they don't realize it yet, but they have lost the information war.
[02:16:34.760 --> 02:16:49.760]  People like you have woken up too many people. And at this point, the only arrow left in their quiver is absolute crisis.
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:59.760]  That's right. And we're now going into it. Hillary admitted they're losing the information war four years ago to Congress.
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:05.760]  But I don't think she even realizes how much they've lost the information war.
[02:17:05.760 --> 02:17:22.760]  Is there any way to get these cornered rats to not destroy everything to keep power? Couldn't the states get together in a first run constitutional convention just to have letters of demand and basically tell the top operatives stop their anti-American activities?
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:34.760]  Don't shut down power plants. Don't let China have unfair trade deals. Start there and then give them a year to exit the United States.
[02:17:34.760 --> 02:17:42.760]  I mean, that of course, as you know, is a student of history, Mr. Rawls, has been done before with corrupt elites who are like a cancer and are too hard to dislodge.
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:49.760]  I mean, could some type of through the system armistice happened and just have these people flake off?
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:18:00.760]  That is possible. And I think one venue for that may be the upcoming Republican National Convention because they don't control all of those individual delegates.
[02:18:00.760 --> 02:18:18.760]  And once a party convention is in a lot of ways like a constitutional convention, once the floor is open, if enough people call for discussion of a particular topic,
[02:18:18.760 --> 02:18:28.760]  it can't be stopped. And I think that at the upcoming Republican National Convention, a lot of these fundamental issues may be raised.
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:37.760]  And we may see another very Goldwater moment for our nation coming up and it could very well happen there.
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:47.760]  That's right, because when they engage in this open theft, it is going to be a huge wake-up call on top of the wake-up call that's already happening and people are really going to see through it.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:55.760]  Do you think it's arrogance overall or fear that they're just nakedly going, yeah, your vote doesn't count, you're used to it, all over TV?
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:19:13.760]  Well, the level of arrogance is just horrendous to think that they can attempt to stage-manage an entire political convention by manipulating the rules of that convention.
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:19.760]  I think it may backfire on them. I think a lot of two things are going to happen.
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:28.760]  Either there's going to be absolute pandemonium on the floor or there's going to be a walkout of a lot of delegates.
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:35.760]  They may just walk to a hotel across the street and start their own convention.
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:43.760]  That's the idea. I'm going to call Roger Stone right now because obviously his former business partner now is pretty much the head of the campaign. They've still got Lew and Dowsky over there on the side.
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:52.760]  But wow, that is a great idea. And I kind of think that's what may be actually planned, but it's funny you brought that up.
[02:19:52.760 --> 02:20:06.760]  Well, again, things are spinning out of control. And at this point, again, I think it's going to come down to a massive crisis of some sort as kind of a last-ditch effort for them to maintain their control.
[02:20:06.760 --> 02:20:24.760]  If things get more out of control, it's going to get more out of control and more out of control. Let's say on a scale of 1 to 100, 100 being the most out of control, full-on nuclear war happening, and it's total insanity, and zero being volholic, pastoral utopias.
[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:26.760]  Where are we on that scale, sir?
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:52.760]  Well, I'd say we're somewhere in the 80s or in the 90s here right now. They're losing control. And at this point, unless they have a crisis that they can use as the excuse to collapse the stock market, cause a banking crisis, and institute a global currency,
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:21:02.760]  they'll need something of that scale to continue to consolidate power. Otherwise, power is going to slip through their grasp.
[02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:10.760]  And so what you keep hammering is they're going to pull a crisis, they're going to false flag, or they're going to wind somebody up, and they're going to create a crisis to be the saviors.
[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:18.760]  It's so huge it diverts from stealing elections and everything else.
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:46.760]  Yeah, they'll probably have a preplanned event on a grand scale. It won't just be something like Sandy Hook, okay? It's going to be more like a major assassination, say, for example, of a key political figure or a key candidate that they'll then try to pin on the patriot movement, for example.
[02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:57.760]  That's right. So they could false flag and kill Donald Trump and blame it on the patriots, or they could do it to Obama. That's what my guts have been telling me is we're entering the season of a political assassination to be pinned on one group or the other.
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:01.760]  It won't matter if it ever gets proven. It'll just cause war on the streets.
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:20.760]  Yes, and there literally will be blood in the streets if that happens. And again, getting back to the political conventions, the party conventions, coming out of the Democratic convention or more likely out of the Republican convention, we could see a huge uproar,
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:34.760]  especially if they attempt to broker this convention and put an insider in, in place of one of the two perceived outsiders.
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:49.760]  And that's the only way, I mean, look, I'll be honest, I don't want to scare people. They could do stuff like a low yield nuke in Cleveland, and then, you know, to have Obama declare a civil emergency saying to, you know, a year now, we're going to have an election.
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:23:01.760]  And then basically, I mean, all the preparations I see is if they're planning something humongous. And I don't want to speculate here, but I said before 9-11, look for them to blow up the World Trade Centers and blame it on their asset bin Laden.
[02:23:01.760 --> 02:23:10.760]  I'm not saying there isn't radical Islam. They're obviously Saudi Arabia, 28 pages. I was just saying I could see the preparation. I could see them beta testing. I could see them getting everybody ready.
[02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:24.760]  And then I called it exactly as they did it. And I'm telling you, I've never seen such frightening rhetoric. Obama's hyping nuclear terror. Everybody else is saying, oh, mushroom cloud over Manhattan in your gut and your sources.
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:32.760]  What are some of the false flag triggers you think that the activating the ISIS al Qaeda sleeper cells they have all over the U.S.? What do you think it could be?
[02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:46.760]  It could very well be ISIS here in the United States or another major event in Europe. But I think they, at this point, see the need to step things up a notch.
[02:23:46.760 --> 02:24:04.760]  So it won't just be guys pulling out AK-47s and hand grenades and shouting al-Huwa Akbar. It's going to be more like nuclear dirty bombs or even nuclear devices that reach critical mass, actual nuclear weapons,
[02:24:04.760 --> 02:24:22.760]  or biological warfare agents or massive use of chemical agents in a confined but heavily populated space. And by that, I mean something like a subway or a stadium full of people where there wouldn't just be
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:41.760]  dozens of deaths or hundreds of deaths. There could be thousands of simultaneous deaths. And that is the level. They want to step things up to that level because it's only out of that level of crisis that they can call for something like martial law.
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:48.760]  Wow. And they've already got quote, several emergencies in Germany and France suspending people's rights. It's amazing.
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:57.760]  What do we do? I mean, I guess we call mainstream media. We do our own shows. Everybody does videos. Everybody comes their own activists and says we don't want nuclear terror.
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:07.760]  If there's nuclear Islamic terror, we hold you responsible, Mr. President. You know, we know you're cooking something. You know, hey, ugly, we know you're cooking.
[02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:15.760]  You know, don't cook it up for me to reverse what Hank Williams said. I mean, this is, what do we do to stop it?
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:26.760]  I really don't, I really don't know an ideal solution other than to continue to wake people up and encourage people to not give up completely on the political process.
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:36.760]  I hear so many people who say it's all over. We can't do anything. No matter who gets into office, they're going to pack the Supreme Court, blah, blah, blah.
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:45.760]  No, I think there still is hope for the political process. So people need to be aware. They need to be politically active. They need to be incredibly vocal.
[02:25:45.760 --> 02:26:01.760]  And don't be buffaloed. There's going to be a lot of changes going on in our country in the next five years where they're going to use hate speech laws to try to silence people.
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:07.760]  I agree. In the end, I want to talk about that next because the answer is everybody use your speech or lose it. They're openly announcing it.
[02:26:07.760 --> 02:26:12.760]  And I want to come back and go to calls. But separately, James Wesley Rawls, survivalblog.com, again, joining us here.
[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:26.760]  If you just tuned in, I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com, syndicated radio slash TV, transmission every day, 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern, looking at this and looking at the different things that they're pulling.
[02:26:26.760 --> 02:26:33.760]  I also think it's important to reach out to some of the bots and some of the mainline liberals who come out to protest Trump.
[02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:38.760]  And once they actually talk to the Trump supporters, I see a lot of videos where people are actually coming together.
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:41.760]  That's not getting a lot of coverage in the media, but it's happening.
[02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:47.760]  I mean, when Lewis Farrakhan says, we don't need to bring more Muslims in because they're going to blow stuff up and then regular Muslims are going to get blamed.
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:57.760]  Nobody covered that because it makes Trump look so common sense. And so I really see them being afraid of doing this crisis. Everybody trying to reach out to each other.
[02:26:57.760 --> 02:26:59.760]  I mean, I think that's a big part of this.
[02:26:59.760 --> 02:27:20.760]  Yeah, if their goal is to divide groups and the groups throw that back in their face by actually showing some cohesiveness and a unity of voice saying, yes, we want less government, we want less control, we want more individual freedom.
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:24.760]  That's going to really throw a monkey wrench into their into their plans.
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:39.760]  Sure. And you they want to continue to divide and conquer. And if if we can actually find some common ground with people on the other end of the political spectrum, it's going to thwart their plans.
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:43.760]  Separately, you bring up don't give them the political process.
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:52.760]  It's become fake. It's become a fraud. But as we get involved, we expose the voting machines as as as we run for office, good people get elected.
[02:27:52.760 --> 02:28:02.760]  It's a battle. We're fighting crooks. Good men and women always trump them, pun intended, when we finally take action. It may take 10 years, may take 30 years, may take six months.
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:10.760]  You never know how it's going to work. We have the moral high ground. And by going there and forcing them to steal the nomination, that only accelerates the awakening.
[02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:13.760]  People think, oh, it's correct. Give up. You can't fix it.
[02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:24.760]  You know, I've always said resistance is victory because in my own life, but also studying history, it's the animating contest of liberty that empowers our liberty muscles. Mr. Rawls.
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:32.760]  I agree with you, Alex. The the political process still has hope.
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:38.760]  It's still at least a kernel of hope there for America and we cannot give up on the process.
[02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:41.760]  Look at how fast people are waking up right now.
[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:47.760]  People are indeed waking up and seeing what comes out of the Republican convention.
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:58.760]  If it is, if they do their broker deal and they have that they do their when it really comes down to his power brokering and people see that.
[02:28:58.760 --> 02:29:10.760]  I think they can't stop people from waking up to what's really going on and people who have called themselves Republicans for many, many years are going to suddenly stop calling themselves Republicans.
[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:14.760]  If they see that the convention is right, it's a Democratic Party plan. They're the dominant party.
[02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:18.760]  The Republicans since the Rockefeller days just just just you play along.
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:26.760]  They're preparing to finally go ahead and kill the party entirely and create one party rule with a vestigial Republican Party in the south.
[02:29:26.760 --> 02:29:29.760]  This is the true fall of America. I want to get your take on that. James Wesley Rawls.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:40.760]  We'll talk about the caliphate and then go right to calls. Talk about your new novel straight ahead that folks can find in bookstores everywhere.
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:58.760]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:03.760]  Going out and protesting Islamophobia. Guess what you've probably been looking for.
[02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:07.760]  Sharia friendly social networks for Muslims are now on the rise.
[02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:29.760]  A month ago, while attending the startup Turkey conference in Antalya, I had the chance to talk to Sharia Fadi, CEO and co-founder of the social networking platform.
[02:30:29.760 --> 02:30:47.760]  He was there to pitch to potential investors his website, which also offers prayer times, job postings, a total locate your nearest mosque and another button to help find your spouse.

[02:32:12.760 --> 02:32:23.760]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.

[02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:26.760]  On mainstream media, government coverups. You want answers? Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:26.760 --> 02:33:52.760]  Look, I don't want to get up here on a high horse, but I grew up in a family that was heavily informed about politics and what was really going on in the world, and I didn't think anything big dealable when I was a kid. Now talk about this, people use it as a discrediting point, act like it's a secret and play a clip from the show. I'm saying it on my show that there were a lot of people that were army officers, a lot of people that worked at intelligence agencies, people that knew about what was going on.
[02:33:52.760 --> 02:34:04.760]  They were all like Mr. America, like Superman characters, just like Mr., I mean, absolutely change old ladies' tires, go give blood, go to the Salvation Army on Christmas. Good Christian people.
[02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:15.760]  And they were manipulated into this whole system. And by the time I was a little kid, I mean, people come over, family come over and stuff, I would just hear about the Federal Reserve, the takeover, and the Communists, and they're going to break up the family.
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:25.760]  I can't believe what these people are doing, and just people sitting around the coffee table, just like Dallas cops coming in and FBI agents and people running around just freaking out.
[02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:37.760]  And I'm like five years old watching all this, and family getting blown up in Guatemala, having shipped in on a C-130, and just all sorts of stuff.
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:46.760]  I mean, Buckley works here, and his dad was down there, and they were routinely attacked by rebels in the government districts, and their house blown up, they were in, because they had all the antennas on the roof.
[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:55.760]  I mean, I'm not going to get into the whole deal. Just the point is that I sit here, and I know this is all real. I know they're coming after us, and you need to understand something.
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:09.760]  The globalist, they love Third World, they love radicalism, they love authoritarianism, because it's like them. They hate Christians, they hate America, they hate free market, they hate all of it.
[02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:15.760]  And they wanted totalitarianism to have their way with us.
[02:35:15.760 --> 02:35:28.760]  They're really bad news people, and you need to understand, people think it's brave to fight them. I'd be the most brave person in the world to not resist the globalist.
[02:35:28.760 --> 02:35:42.760]  If I'm out on a sailboat in the middle of a great lake, and all of a sudden a huge leak forms, and the boat's going to sink, and it's freezing water, I'm going to be bailing as fast as I can to get back to shore, not because I have courage.
[02:35:42.760 --> 02:35:58.760]  I'm going to be busting my butt because I want to live. So that's why, don't call up and say I'm a hero. Do not call up and say how great I am. Folks, it's normal to fight this. It's abnormal not to.
[02:35:58.760 --> 02:36:03.760]  These people are really bad, and humanity deserves not to go through this anymore.
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:12.760]  You've seen all the tyrannies, and most governments are horrible and oppressive, and now you see the way we're going, it's bad news. I want to go back and get into a new novel, take your phone calls.
[02:36:12.760 --> 02:36:25.760]  I'm not going to belabor this, but you need to understand that the reason I can be on the same page with somebody like Rawls, or the same page as the Colonel Schaefer, or the same page as the Tosh Plumlee whistleblower, or the same page as the Lieutenant Marine Corps Colonel,
[02:36:25.760 --> 02:36:36.760]  or the same page as everybody else, or the same page as congressmen that come on the show, like Walter Jones, is because it's a real page. It's like the Sammy Hagar song.
[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:45.760]  It's a fact, not my point of view, and you know it's true. And so, debate's over.
[02:36:45.760 --> 02:36:55.760]  We have a scientific tyranny coming in that's very easy to defeat, because it's so big, and stinking, and open, and it's been so arrogant.
[02:36:55.760 --> 02:37:04.760]  Because all the other tyrannies came as tanks, or weapons, or troops, so they thought, oh, we're corporate, we're sophisticated, the hillbillies won't look at what we're doing.
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:11.760]  Well, the hillbillies wouldn't look when everything was still pretty nice. Now they're looking and they're finding out you did it. You're not getting away with this.
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:23.760]  You won't be safe anywhere with your money. I don't have some big raging thing to prove to want to war with you. I'm not an idiot. I want to stop this now.
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:29.760]  So I hope listeners and people understand this isn't a game.
[02:37:29.760 --> 02:37:44.760]  And when I say tell your friends and family about the show, infowars.com, infowars.com, forward slash show. When I tell you go to infowars.com, forward slash show and download the free iPhone out of the droid app or to send out articles or to send out podcasts,
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:50.760]  some people go, well, the government will get me if I do that. We're the government. We're the people. The military is ignoring all these threats.
[02:37:50.760 --> 02:37:58.760]  Just like Rawls said, they're coming after our free speech. Now is the time to stand, to protest, to demonstrate. You think I want to go to Cleveland?
[02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:02.680]  three little kids. You think I really want to get up there? You think I really want to be all over
[02:38:02.680 --> 02:38:12.200]  the streets? I'm going to be there because I'm afraid of letting these people win. A lot more than
[02:38:12.200 --> 02:38:18.680]  I'm afraid will happen to me. Stuff in the game, people. These people want to hurt you and your
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:22.760]  family. Okay, you understand that? They hate you because you're a good person. They want to dominate
[02:38:22.760 --> 02:38:31.400]  you. Where is your instinct that God gave you to resist these people? Get up and take action.
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:36.840]  I want to see our stories, our videos, Rawls material, everything plastered everywhere.
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:42.600]  This is a war. I have climbed up on the billboards at night personally. I have put the
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:46.600]  fires everywhere. I have flown around on airplanes. I've done stuff I don't even talk about on air
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:50.600]  and I'm not going to get into it here today. I do it at the grocery store. I do it at church
[02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:57.240]  everywhere because I'm fighting for my life. You understand that? You're in a fight for your life
[02:38:57.240 --> 02:39:01.800]  and your children's future. You need to act like it and I'm not bitching anybody, but they've put
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:06.520]  us into a trance, myself included, and I need people to go to m4warstore.com and get to Hillary
[02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:11.800]  for present t-shirts, to get the mola and lube, to meet like-minded people, and to spread the word
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:16.760]  and support the transmission. We brought the Hillary for present shirt back. It's been augmented.
[02:39:16.760 --> 02:39:21.400]  It's a new edition, but it looks pretty much the same. We also have the new vitamin mineral fusion.
[02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:25.400]  You absolutely need that with your diet to boost your health, everything else. It's a game changer.
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:31.240]  X2, super male vitality, the methylcobalamin, vitamin B12, secret 12s back in m4warslife.com,
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:38.360]  m4warstore.com, or call toll 3888-2533139. I want the money to have more reporters be able to go
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:43.080]  and cover everything and not spend all my time jacking around trying to get sponsors and I'm
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:49.880]  not complaining, but we need fuel in this war. We need to be strong to face the enemy in the storm,
[02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:53.960]  and I thank you all for your support. I know it's rough out there. Thank you for your prayers,
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:57.560]  first and foremost. All right, Mr. Rawls, I want to give you the floor for about six, seven,
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:00.680]  eight minutes, because I just get really excited talking about all this stuff, because things
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:05.000]  are so earnest now. It's all happening now. We've been proven right. I know it's, how does it feel
[02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:10.120]  for you writing for 30 years to now see it all proven right and to see that your work has become
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:14.600]  basically prescient. I mean, I don't personally, I'm not excited about the fact I've been proven
[02:40:14.600 --> 02:40:19.000]  right. It's a very sick feeling, but at least we've been proven right. So more people pay attention
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:24.040]  now, and then let's get into the caliphate. Sure. Well, it is gratifying to see that,
[02:40:25.640 --> 02:40:31.320]  you know, back in 1990, when I wrote the first draft of my first novel, people were saying that
[02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:39.400]  it was absolutely inconceivable to see a stock market collapse and a collapse in the US dollar
[02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:46.600]  as a currency unit. And now people aren't saying that anymore. They recognize that it really is
[02:40:46.600 --> 02:40:52.920]  a possibility. And it is gratifying to see that people are waking up. But beyond that,
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:41:02.840]  it's important that as people wake up, they're politically active. They don't hold back from
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:10.120]  sharing this knowledge with their friends and that they are fully committed to the fight ahead
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:15.480]  of them. You know, the old joke is that when the farmer was putting together breakfast,
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:26.040]  the chicken was involved, but the pig was committed. And that's the stage that we're at
[02:41:26.040 --> 02:41:35.800]  right now, where we have to be fully committed to this because the battle is on. It's right before
[02:41:35.800 --> 02:41:43.240]  us. And what I'm trying to do with my new novel series, the counter caliphate series, is to wake
[02:41:43.240 --> 02:41:50.120]  people up to the big picture of what's going on geopolitically and to point out to them that
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:42:01.080]  we are not just victims of our circumstances. We can actually make a change as individuals
[02:42:01.720 --> 02:42:07.320]  that we can individually push for the establishment of a Christian nation of refuge,
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:10.760]  for instance. That's what I put forth in the first novel in the series.
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:19.640]  That kind of change can take place. And because we are a globally interconnected
[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:32.040]  society where individuals can make an enormous difference, the individual efforts of waking
[02:42:32.040 --> 02:42:40.200]  people up, organizing and creating alternatives to the current system can happen. They will happen.
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:48.360]  With God's help, these kind of changes will take place. And just like cockroaches scurrying away
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:53.080]  from the light, you turn enough lights on, like you're doing with all your educational
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:43:03.400]  quests, the roaches are going to go scurrying for cover. And people will realize
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:10.760]  that they individually can make a difference and they can truly change things. That's the
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:16.760]  encouraging thing. And that's why as a Christian and as a patriot, I hold out a lot of hope.
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:26.440]  Because I think in the long run, we are bound to win. As your promo says, we are on the march.
[02:43:26.440 --> 02:43:34.040]  We will prevail in the long run. And that's very encouraging. So I do encourage people to
[02:43:35.880 --> 02:43:41.160]  get active and to share this knowledge as much as they can with others.
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:45.720]  No one knows who said it. Last time I checked, it's
[02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.800]  author unknown of the statement. There are no atheists and foxholes.
[02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:56.120]  But it is true that armies throughout history know about Providence. They know about trying
[02:43:56.120 --> 02:44:01.240]  to purify themselves. They know about trying to seek God. And that's because they've learned,
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:07.880]  even the most arrogant atheists, that you laugh at God. It's very unlucky. But you talk about
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:13.400]  George Washington and others. Providence is a real thing. And I've experienced it in my life.
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.920]  And I just feel sorry for people that really think that this world is a joke and who don't
[02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:24.760]  think there aren't good and evil forces active in the world. Those people are so spiritually
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:27.800]  blind. They have no idea what's coming or what they're about to face.
[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:38.120]  Well, that's our real hope, really, is in Christ. And as we look at this whole global
[02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:46.760]  political mess that's developed, we can have hope in the certain knowledge of our salvation.
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:52.120]  And we can be absolutely fearless with that knowledge in the fight ahead,
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:57.560]  knowing that we know our destination. If we're going to heaven, they can't take that away from us.
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:02.440]  So we can be fearless in this fight. Other tidbits, other tidbits before we go to calls
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:04.200]  that you'd like to relay to the listeners today.
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:16.200]  Yeah, his Skype was breaking up and we just lost his audio. It should come back in a moment.
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:23.560]  The Skype completely disconnect. Okay, James, can you hear us? Yeah, I have you.
[02:45:24.120 --> 02:45:27.720]  Okay. Any other little tidbits you want to add before we go to some calls?
[02:45:29.880 --> 02:45:39.320]  Well, I just want to encourage people to wake up individually, wake up their friends. It's time to
[02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:47.960]  to stock up, team up, and train up. Because we're far beyond just politics with this now.
[02:45:47.960 --> 02:45:54.920]  And the problems that have been created are going to affect us on a physical level. I mean,
[02:45:54.920 --> 02:46:02.840]  in terms of individual sustenance, in terms of individual, you know, just personal security
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:09.640]  of staying alive. So you need to you need to have food storage, you need to have training,
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:17.000]  you need to have alternative currency, whether it's precious metals or ammunition for barter.
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:24.280]  It's actually come to that time where if you don't stock up, if you don't team up with your
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:30.280]  friends who are like-minded, and if you don't train up, because those supplies just by themselves
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:34.680]  are kind of useless, unless you know exactly what you're doing with them. There's a learning
[02:46:34.680 --> 02:46:40.760]  curve with all of these things. It's time truly, folks, to stock up, team up, and train up to be
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:45.640]  ready for the dark days ahead. And it only runs from bad to worse. We're not trying to be negative
[02:46:45.640 --> 02:46:49.880]  here, folks. They plan to collapse Western civilization to bring in social engineering,
[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:53.960]  they need to make you very poor and desperate to do that. They do it in every communist takeover.
[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:58.840]  This is not a communist program, but the globalists are using communist reeducation tools,
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:03.400]  and even communist terminology now in army manuals that are declassified. So this is very,
[02:47:03.400 --> 02:47:07.560]  very dangerous. They use what's worked before. They've been preparing the ground here for a
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.560]  while. Tim in Wyoming has a question for our guest, Mr. Rawls. Go ahead, Tim.
[02:47:13.160 --> 02:47:17.800]  Yes, yes. Hello. Thanks for taking my call. My question for you, Mr. Rawls, is
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:23.720]  Alec asked this question of listeners yesterday, and I never got a chance to call in and say what
[02:47:23.720 --> 02:47:31.560]  my line of the sand was. What is your line in the sand for when we should basically stand up and
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:36.840]  be counted, so to speak? Because I mean, I'm already doing as much as I can possibly do
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:40.440]  in my small town in Wyoming. I think a lot of that's targeting. I mean, the people around you are
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:44.600]  just minions of the systems. Going after them doesn't do anything. That's why I'm defensive.
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:47.720]  At least I have this somebody's attacking me. I know they're in the wrong, but a lot of this is
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:52.120]  just exposing the operatives so that if everything does go to a shooting war, people know who the
[02:47:52.120 --> 02:47:54.440]  foreign enemy is. But Mr. Rawls, your comments.
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:04.600]  Right. Well, I think everybody has to draw their own individual line, as it were, because for
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:11.560]  someone who is a single person, for example, without a family, without children to worry about,
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:16.680]  that line in the sand might be a lot farther out than someone who has a large family to worry about
[02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:26.680]  that they're going to lock and load at a much later date than someone who doesn't have that level
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:32.120]  of responsibility for a family. That's right. My line in the sand is protect my family, protect my
[02:48:32.120 --> 02:48:38.040]  community, not be offensive. I'm offensive with information and then try to be defensive like
[02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:44.040]  a mother hen. But then at what point then do you go aggressive? And boy, once the people that are
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:47.720]  in a mother hen position go aggressive, that's when heads really roll historically correct.
[02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:55.960]  Yes. And again, people have to be wise as serpents and meek as doves as the Bible teaches.
[02:48:56.600 --> 02:49:03.320]  Right now, if you look at what happened with the Bundy Ranch and with the Malheur Wildlife Refuge,
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:11.800]  people who stood up too early, too vocally, and who made some tactical mistakes in terms of committing
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:19.400]  felonies on federal property, are now feeling the wrath of the federal government with multiple,
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:25.880]  multiple felony charges against them. They walk into a trap. Yes, big time. And unfortunately,
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:33.000]  they all did it on camera, gave their names, and were seen on camera with weapons and the site of
[02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:40.520]  those weapons alone was used as felony charges of use of firearms to the commission of a felon.
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:44.760]  And they thought just because they were in the right on a few issues, they didn't know about the
[02:49:44.760 --> 02:49:52.200]  optics. It was very, very foolish. Right. And so people have to be wise about that sort of thing.
[02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:57.080]  You have to be, you have to pick your fights. You have to choose your battles wisely. Don't tilt
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:02.840]  at windmills. That's one reason I've never gotten involved. And even though the tax system in the
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:08.520]  United States is inherently wrong, I chose not to fight the tax battle because I saw what happened
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:13.960]  to too many tax processes. Exactly. We're fighting the general globalist occupied takeover, that it's
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:18.520]  a worldwide takeover. It's illegitimate. We're occupied. We're not fighting each tentacle.
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:23.240]  We're exposing to everyone that this is an illegitimate takeover that's now more naked than
[02:50:23.240 --> 02:50:33.560]  ever. Right. So again, choose your, choose your battles wisely. And when you go to a public protest,
[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:39.480]  you need to think very seriously about how far away you park your car, for example, so your
[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:45.960]  license plate number won't be photographed. And whether or not you're going to disguise yourself,
[02:50:46.520 --> 02:50:52.680]  but don't be buffaloed into not attending at all. Well, either choose to be totally public or be
[02:50:52.680 --> 02:50:56.280]  underground. That's, that's the model. I think people should be completely underground or totally
[02:50:56.280 --> 02:51:07.240]  out in the open. I'm totally out in the open. December 7, 1941, a date which will live and

[02:53:05.560 --> 02:53:10.840]  to sit down. I was tired and lethargic, but after taking hard and body extract, my energy level

[02:55:09.960 --> 02:55:16.360]  itself and Islam for a full hour or more in the near future, but right now let's just go ahead
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:21.160]  and go back to calls. Speaking of the Caliphate, more in Texas. You're on the air with James
[02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:27.640]  Wesley Rawls. Hi y'all going today. My question and I don't want to be long-winded, but my question
[02:55:27.640 --> 02:55:34.120]  is the original founder of Islam was black people and it wasn't Arab. But my question is
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:41.240]  that the Europeans actually helped with the Arab in charge. Is it kind of like, I don't want to
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:47.240]  say just it, but is it payback for them outlying with Arabs instead of black people as they should
[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:52.760]  have allied with? That's my question. All right. Well, let me try to throw about, I mean, I get
[02:55:52.760 --> 02:55:57.400]  what you're saying that it is true that the British Empire and others kind of set up Islam,
[02:55:57.400 --> 02:56:01.880]  put the Wahhabis in control, the worst sect obviously, who did say that black people weren't
[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:07.880]  humans in their, not the Korean, they wrote that afterwards and kill all the blacks they find in
[02:56:07.880 --> 02:56:12.040]  areas of Africa. That's why I don't get so many blacks, you know, joining that form of Islam.
[02:56:12.040 --> 02:56:14.680]  But Mr. Rawls, you've studied this. What's your take on what he said?
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:23.800]  Well, to begin with, I think the whole concept of race is spurious. I think there's only one race
[02:56:23.800 --> 02:56:32.360]  and that's the human race. Yes. And for many, many years, kings and princes and parliaments
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:39.960]  have been trying to divide people by putting labels on the so-called races and to, to drive
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:47.400]  a wedge between people to create conflict, which they can then manage to their, to meet their
[02:56:47.400 --> 02:56:53.160]  goals. So I reject the whole concept of racism to begin with, at races and races.
[02:56:53.160 --> 02:56:55.800]  Volcanization. Thank you more. But it's an interesting question. Well, I mean, here's
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:57:00.840]  Mexico, six months to a year hard labor, they torture you, they shock you, they beat you.
[02:57:00.840 --> 02:57:04.360]  That's in the Guardian. I said just last week, they beat you up. They tear, I mean,
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:09.320]  Mexico has some of the most draconian rules and, but they can't have huge third world
[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:13.480]  populations coming in. They'll collapse even worse. I'm not saying what they're doing is good.
[02:57:13.480 --> 02:57:16.840]  How are we supposed to take all these people though and give them everything free? I'm not
[02:57:16.840 --> 02:57:21.160]  against these poor Latin Americans, but the globalists are bringing them in, turning them
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:26.920]  into a tribal racial based group, even if that's a fraud to then ally with the socialist and vote
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:34.920]  our guns away. What do we do then, Mr. Rawls? Well, we need to reject racism. We need to
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:41.720]  point out when it's being used as a psychological weapon. And we can't, we can't fall for the
[02:57:41.720 --> 02:57:51.400]  race baiting. It's important that we recognize that as American citizens, we represent the,
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:57.080]  the end result of what our founding fathers had in mind. And it, it actually worked remarkably
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:03.560]  well for many, many generations. And yeah, granted, we're, we're in, in dire straits right now,
[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:11.080]  and we've run up a huge national debt, but they cannot extinguish the spirit of individual liberty
[02:58:11.080 --> 02:58:15.240]  that still exists in this. I totally agree, but, but we can't have totally open borders and just
[02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:24.280]  bring people in and sign them up with a socialist. No, that we have to, we have to be very protective
[02:58:24.280 --> 02:58:32.760]  of our borders, but for people who are American citizens, we have to fully bring them up in the
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:37.560]  culture. Absolutely. I mean, to bring them into the renaissance, 70 seconds. Thank you, Mr. Rawls.
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:42.200]  Stay there. We'll be back with more calls, Matt and others in full wars.com is the tip of the spear,

[02:59:51.160 --> 02:59:55.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:55.160 --> 03:00:15.800]  The Hitman comes. He knows that he's been cheated on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live
[03:00:15.800 --> 03:00:24.120]  on the front lines of the info war. The song says it all. When the Hitman comes,
[03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:28.840]  he knows he's been cheated. Imagine a Hitman not knowing where he's been sent to a city.
[03:00:29.720 --> 03:00:32.920]  They realize when he gets there, he's gonna be given the picture of who's gonna be killing
[03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:40.680]  and when. When they give him the photo, it's his son or daughter. Same thing, you're killing your
[03:00:40.680 --> 03:00:48.040]  future. You're lying to yourself. You think you're winning. Don't be part of it. But also a lot of
[03:00:48.040 --> 03:00:52.600]  good people get guilted by the fact they've been involved in evil. And so then they just say it's
[03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:56.520]  my lot. I'm supposed to stay with it. I'm a horrible person and they drink themselves to death
[03:00:56.520 --> 03:01:02.600]  or whatever the case is. No, repent. Get out of it. Realize you were lied to. I know most people
[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:06.360]  out there aren't government Hitmen, but that's just a parallel to what we're talking about.
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:13.400]  Because I knew one and a family member and they were so sad and were just really upset people
[03:01:13.400 --> 03:01:18.040]  until the day they died. And they just said incrementally they got into it and the evil and
[03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:21.640]  by the time they got out of it, it had wrecked them for the rest of their life. That's another big
[03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:25.320]  lie. You never get out of this stuff. That's not true. A lot of people get out of the evil folks,
[03:01:25.320 --> 03:01:29.720]  but it's time to just stop being so naive. Survivalblog.com, the new book that I want to
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:32.360]  do a whole hour on. I want to read it. I haven't read it yet. It's got great reviews
[03:01:33.240 --> 03:01:36.360]  from a constitutional Christian libertarian perspective is land of promise.
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:41.080]  James Wesley Rawls kind of given commentary ride the shot. I don't want to say it's been great.
[03:01:41.080 --> 03:01:46.680]  Matt, you're on the air. Go ahead with our guests. Hey, just a quick couple of comments
[03:01:46.680 --> 03:01:51.720]  wishing you both health and strength. Alex, you mentioned yesterday in terms of the Cleveland
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:57.800]  Convention protest. Be sure to make sure that folks know the dates, the dates that that convention
[03:01:57.800 --> 03:02:04.760]  is going on is on July 18th. Also in terms of Ohio, people will vote for Trump because what
[03:02:04.760 --> 03:02:10.760]  you've got in Ohio speaking as an Ohioan is that the manufacturing based cities, places like
[03:02:10.760 --> 03:02:16.760]  Dayton obviously stole. We're almost out of time, but a quick question. Yes, we're going to have websites,
[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:19.000]  the date, the demonstrations, believing the next few days we're coming. I'm going to be at the
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:22.120]  top of the spear with Roger Stone. Get ready. You have any quick questions for our guests?
[03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:27.960]  Just a quick note. You know, for whatever it's worth, they have an announcement the other day
[03:02:27.960 --> 03:02:33.720]  in one of the regional newspapers in Northwest Ohio that Toledo, Ohio is basically one hot summer
[03:02:33.720 --> 03:02:41.000]  day away from a Flint like water crisis. I don't know if you guys. That's another question. The
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:44.920]  elites have been stealing the money, not upgrading our infrastructure. That's another big issue,
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:53.080]  Mr. Rawls. Yes, we have an infrastructure in our country that's crumbling, and it's incumbent
[03:02:53.080 --> 03:03:00.440]  upon individuals at this point to step up and provide for their own families. Every family
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:06.680]  should have a good quality water filter, in fact, actually two. You need a compact filter,
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:11.960]  and you need a full size filter like a big Berkey. If you don't have that for your family,
[03:03:11.960 --> 03:03:19.800]  you have failed your family because obviously you cannot depend on civic water supplies,
[03:03:20.520 --> 03:03:25.720]  and it's incumbent upon you as the head of a family to provide for your family. Absolutely.
[03:03:25.720 --> 03:03:31.240]  And from the tests that are out there, the best stuff is Pro Pure, the G2, also the Alexa Pure
[03:03:31.240 --> 03:03:35.560]  Excellent. There's some other excellent gravity feds out there. We have 10% off promo code water,
[03:03:35.560 --> 03:03:41.480]  and then he said a compact one like the live straw of the survival spring that makes ponds and stuff
[03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:45.560]  safe to drink. What he's saying is essential. What else do folks need, Mr. Rawls?
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:57.240]  Well, I want to reiterate that people need to stay active politically. They need to wake up
[03:03:57.240 --> 03:04:06.600]  and again, stock up, team up, train up, and do support Alex's advertisers and his own store
[03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:13.480]  because that keeps this message alive. It keeps the message out there, and don't fall down on your
[03:04:13.480 --> 03:04:18.280]  own responsibility as a head of a family to provide for your family because we're going to
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:24.840]  see a lot of disruption in the years to come. So you need to think in terms of nutrition,
[03:04:26.120 --> 03:04:33.560]  water storage, and water filters, and first aid, medical equipment, and self-defense.
[03:04:34.840 --> 03:04:41.000]  You've got to cover all those bases systematically for the dark days ahead.
[03:04:41.000 --> 03:04:44.680]  Even mainstream media says we're going into a global depression. Has it already begun in 10
[03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:50.600]  seconds? Well, yeah, I think we are on the cusp of a global depression. And at this point,
[03:04:50.600 --> 03:04:56.200]  it's just a matter of being physically prepared for it because that's right. The handwriting is
[03:04:56.200 --> 03:05:00.920]  on the wall. Yes, sir. Thank you so much. We'll talk to you soon. A leaked memo reveals how the
[03:05:00.920 --> 03:05:07.640]  Trump campaign really feels about the establishment. An internal memo leaked to the Washington Post
[03:05:07.640 --> 03:05:14.200]  reveals the level of disdain that Trump has for the political establishment and their talking heads
[03:05:14.200 --> 03:05:19.640]  in the mainstream media. The memo entitled, Digging Through the Bulls**t, is written by
[03:05:19.640 --> 03:05:24.520]  Donald Trump's senior advisor, Barry Bennett, who said the mainstream media and Washington
[03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:30.600]  establishment are working together like never before to bash the Trump campaign. As the networks
[03:05:30.600 --> 03:05:36.520]  have labeled last week the worst week ever for Donald Trump, and they are proclaiming that the
[03:05:36.520 --> 03:05:42.600]  end is near for his presidential campaign. The memo goes on to point out the disconnect between
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:49.400]  Trump's rising popularity and the media talking points. Another pathetic display by the so-called
[03:05:49.400 --> 03:05:55.720]  experts who line their pockets at the expense of our candidates and causes. You can learn more

[03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:31.320]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host for this fourth hour. We're
[03:08:31.320 --> 03:08:36.280]  going to be joining many of our reporters on the road. We've got Rob Dew, Richard Reeves,
[03:08:36.280 --> 03:08:40.040]  they're both in Wisconsin. They're looking at the various rallies that are going on there. Richard
[03:08:40.040 --> 03:08:47.800]  Reeves has a special report about the media hypocrisy with Hillary Clinton's response to
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:53.000]  someone who questioned her on fossil fuel donations, basically got in his face. She also had another
[03:08:53.000 --> 03:09:00.840]  blow-up this weekend. That was her gaffe on abortion. And of course, there's been no discussion of that
[03:09:00.840 --> 03:09:05.160]  really by the mainstream media. It was highlighted on the Drudge Report, but the mainstream media has
[03:09:05.160 --> 03:09:12.120]  done very little to talk about how she stepped over the line and used terms that were inappropriate
[03:09:12.120 --> 03:09:17.720]  for the abortion industry, terms like an unborn child. No, no, no, no, no. It's a fetus. We've
[03:09:17.720 --> 03:09:22.440]  told you over and over again, Hillary. It is a fetus. You can't refer to it as an unborn child
[03:09:22.440 --> 03:09:28.680]  or as a person. And of course, they had this discussion whether or not there were constitutional
[03:09:28.680 --> 03:09:35.880]  rights for this non-entity that is being carried. Half of them, women. Think about that. And of
[03:09:35.880 --> 03:09:41.160]  course, she talked about it being aborted, not terminated. We have to remember the correct
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:48.520]  phrases are terminated fetus. Just like the military has collateral damage. He's not killing
[03:09:48.520 --> 03:09:54.200]  innocent people. It's collateral damage. And we don't have assassination hit lists. We have a
[03:09:54.200 --> 03:09:59.800]  disposition matrix. All of these things are very important. The public could get very upset if
[03:09:59.800 --> 03:10:05.560]  they realize how we're murdering people from the time even before they're born. So we have to use
[03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:12.280]  the right terminology to keep the people in line. Now, as you look at Wisconsin tonight, understand
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:18.520]  that tomorrow's election is really just the establishment's push-pull. As we pointed out
[03:10:18.520 --> 03:10:25.320]  before, look at the core of the GOP establishment, the RNC chair, previous, the Speaker of the House,
[03:10:25.320 --> 03:10:31.160]  Paul Ryan, and of course, Scott Walker, who was their great white hope back at the very beginning,
[03:10:31.160 --> 03:10:36.520]  who they found out had absolutely no pulse and was a piece of wood. So he disappeared. And I would
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:43.000]  say that previous essentially is a piece of wood as well. This guy, I don't know what's
[03:10:43.000 --> 03:10:46.440]  the matter with him. And of course, the GOP establishment, especially previous,
[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:53.080]  is really doesn't understand how this is being perceived by the general public. I think they're
[03:10:53.080 --> 03:10:58.920]  absolutely tone deaf and brain dead. When you're out there bragging about the fact
[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:05.080]  that you're going to throw out millions of votes and you're going to change the delegates up and
[03:11:05.080 --> 03:11:10.840]  all this, I don't see how they think that's going to help the GOP. We've gone from a situation where
[03:11:11.720 --> 03:11:16.840]  election after election, they have put key issues out there, campaigned on these issues,
[03:11:16.840 --> 03:11:22.120]  issues like we're going to stop the Obamacare mandate, we're going to fix the borders that are
[03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:28.840]  totally uncontrolled. And yet, as we elect these people, they throw our issues away immediately.
[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:33.720]  Absolutely not even pretending that they're going to do anything about it. Look at what our new
[03:11:33.720 --> 03:11:39.560]  Speaker of the House did with the Obama climate change treaty that was negotiated in Paris. We
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:45.080]  had people in the Senate bravely saying senators, GOP senators saying, well, we're going to have
[03:11:45.080 --> 03:11:50.760]  something to say about that climate change treaty within three days. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell
[03:11:50.760 --> 03:11:55.880]  had pushed through the omnibus bill, completely funded that, completely funded the Obamacare
[03:11:55.880 --> 03:12:02.440]  mandate, the open borders, left them absolutely no leverage with Obama. They passed everything,
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:08.760]  gave him a blank check essentially, and of course increased the debt significantly,
[03:12:08.760 --> 03:12:13.400]  raised the debt ceiling, they did all of that for us. These are the people who are now after they
[03:12:13.400 --> 03:12:18.600]  have betrayed the Republican voters, campaigning on all these issues, then immediately throwing
[03:12:18.600 --> 03:12:24.040]  these issues out and doing exactly the opposite, just like Marco Rubio doing exactly the opposite.
[03:12:24.040 --> 03:12:28.040]  Now they come to the point where the American voters have said,
[03:12:28.040 --> 03:12:33.080]  you know what, we don't trust these GOP politicians anymore. Let's get a non-politician,
[03:12:33.080 --> 03:12:38.680]  a true outsider. That's why Donald Trump is ahead in the polls. That's why he's ahead
[03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:42.680]  in the votes. And then they come in and say he's got absolutely nothing but a bunch of voters.
[03:12:42.680 --> 03:12:48.040]  And now they're going to not only throw out our issues, they're talking about throwing out our
[03:12:48.040 --> 03:12:52.760]  votes. That is the betrayal of this organization. Now let's look at what's going to be happening
[03:12:52.760 --> 03:13:00.280]  after this. Of course, Wisconsin, it is close, Cruz is ahead. But after this, it's not going to be
[03:13:00.280 --> 03:13:05.720]  very competitive for Mr. Cruz. This is a recent poll that's come out. They're looking at Ted Cruz
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:13.400]  and Wisconsin ahead of Trump 43.37. However, after this, it moves to New York and it moves to
[03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:19.880]  Pennsylvania. How's that looking? Well, not so good for Cruz and Kasich. In New York, Trump has a
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:30.200]  31% lead. Not 31%, a 31% lead over Cruz and Kasich. He's at 52%. Cruz is at 21%.
[03:13:30.200 --> 03:13:36.360]  Kasich is at 20% in New York. I guess Cruz wishes he hadn't made that comment about
[03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:41.400]  he doesn't share New York values. He doesn't value New Yorkers. Okay, then in Pennsylvania,
[03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:47.320]  it doesn't look any better for him. Okay, you've got Trump at 47. Cruz and Kasich are at 29 and
[03:13:47.320 --> 03:13:53.400]  22. Not much better. And of course, most of these that are coming up are winner take all
[03:13:53.400 --> 03:13:57.240]  primaries. So it doesn't look very good for them. There's a lot of primaries that are going to be
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:02.040]  moving into the Northeast. It is not friendly territory for Ted Cruz. Of course, he was telling
[03:14:02.040 --> 03:14:07.080]  everybody his best areas were going to be in the South and yet he lost the popular vote in the
[03:14:07.080 --> 03:14:11.480]  South. He's stealing the delegates, but he lost the popular vote in the South. And of course,
[03:14:11.480 --> 03:14:17.000]  those delegates are going to be there for the first round, no matter what Ted Cruz does. I guess
[03:14:17.000 --> 03:14:22.520]  they could change the rules on that as well. Why not? You know, everything is up for grabs with
[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:28.280]  this corrupt bunch of lawyers. But now we also have a new poll out of California. Now, California
[03:14:28.280 --> 03:14:34.600]  is the very last day of the primaries. It is the very last primary and it is a huge primary.
[03:14:34.600 --> 03:14:41.000]  It has the most number of delegates. Texas is second and then a close third to Texas are the
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:49.240]  super delegates of the GOP. But California has, I think, is about 170 to 175, something like that.
[03:14:49.240 --> 03:14:53.320]  Donald Trump leads the Republican field in California. It's now two months out before
[03:14:53.320 --> 03:15:00.920]  this last primary in California. Trump leads at 37%. Cruz is behind at 30 and Kasich is at 12.
[03:15:00.920 --> 03:15:06.920]  It's not looking too good for John Kasich, the man who needs more than 100% of the delegates
[03:15:06.920 --> 03:15:12.360]  in order to win the nomination up front, honestly and squarely. Of course, it's not looking too
[03:15:12.360 --> 03:15:18.520]  good for Ted Cruz either when he needs to have 90% of the delegates coming up.
[03:15:19.160 --> 03:15:22.600]  They say that Cruz gains on Trump and makes it a closer race. When you look at those that are
[03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:27.160]  most likely to vote in the June 7th primary in California, Trump and Cruz are then neck and neck
[03:15:27.160 --> 03:15:33.640]  earning 36% and 35% support respectively. And remember, this is a closed primary. If you want
[03:15:33.640 --> 03:15:40.440]  to vote in that primary and you are an independent or a Democrat, you need to change your registration
[03:15:40.440 --> 03:15:46.120]  before the primary date. Very important for those people in California to understand that they need
[03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:50.280]  to register as Republican. They can't walk in. It's not an open primary. Some of these states
[03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:54.760]  you can walk in and they ask you, do you want a Democrat ballot or do you want a Republican ballot?
[03:15:54.760 --> 03:16:00.680]  And some of these states, however, like California, you have to be registered with the party by a date
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:04.680]  certain before the primary begins. And they're not going to waive those rules for you.
[03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:11.080]  Okay, they'll waive the rules for John Kasich to get on the ballot in Pennsylvania. He missed the
[03:16:11.080 --> 03:16:15.800]  deadline. He missed the total number of people that he needed, signatures he needed to get on the
[03:16:15.800 --> 03:16:21.320]  ballot. And this is something that's critical to his path, presumably. That's what he's been
[03:16:21.320 --> 03:16:25.880]  telling everybody. I'm going to do really well in Pennsylvania. And yet he couldn't be bothered
[03:16:26.600 --> 03:16:33.800]  to get 2000 verified signatures to legally get on the ballot in Pennsylvania. So they just waived
[03:16:33.800 --> 03:16:39.800]  the requirements for him because he's an insider with the GOP. They don't waive the requirements
[03:16:39.800 --> 03:16:44.040]  for anybody who's an independent, anybody who's a third party candidate. I can guarantee you that.
[03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:50.760]  I've seen just the opposite happen. I've seen them take it to the nth degree to keep people they
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:54.760]  don't want off the ballot. And I've seen them waive the rules just like they waive the rules for
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:17:00.600]  Hillary and Bernie in Washington, D.C. when the Democrat party failed to turn in their
[03:17:01.240 --> 03:17:06.280]  signatures and their information to get on the ballot in Washington, D.C. They missed their
[03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:11.880]  deadline. They did absolutely nothing about it except one person tried to keep Bernie Sanders
[03:17:11.880 --> 03:17:15.560]  off the ballot. And they said, no, no, no, we'll just waive that and keep both of them on.
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:20.280]  I'll also point out to you, of course, there's some things we're going to be covering tonight
[03:17:20.280 --> 03:17:28.440]  on the nightly news at 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern. We're going to be talking about the new Supreme
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:33.480]  Court decision in Pennsylvania. The state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania has said that they're going
[03:17:33.480 --> 03:17:38.120]  to waive the requirements and they're going to let Ted Cruz be on the ballot there that he is
[03:17:38.120 --> 03:17:43.080]  eligible to run for president even though he's born in Canada and he only had one parent who was
[03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:47.880]  an American citizen and he didn't revoke his Canadian citizenship until the time he started
[03:17:47.880 --> 03:17:52.200]  to run for president, no problem. We're just going to let that go. So we're going to do a report
[03:17:52.200 --> 03:17:56.040]  on that tonight on the nightly news. We're going to talk about the fact that you may not have
[03:17:56.040 --> 03:18:01.480]  realized this, but between 2003 and 2008, there were no less during that five-year period,
[03:18:01.480 --> 03:18:07.880]  there was no less than eight attempts within Congress to try to strike the term natural-born
[03:18:07.880 --> 03:18:14.440]  citizen out of the constitutional language or to redefine it or to say that, well, we're not
[03:18:14.440 --> 03:18:18.120]  going to say anything about where you were born. We don't really care where you're born, we don't
[03:18:18.120 --> 03:18:22.840]  care if you have a connection to this country, if your parents were American citizens, we're
[03:18:22.840 --> 03:18:28.440]  going to waive that and there's a reason that the founders put that in. There was a logic for that,
[03:18:28.440 --> 03:18:32.440]  there was a purpose for that requirement and of course we know what that requirement means.
[03:18:32.440 --> 03:18:36.120]  We can go back and we can find what the original language said just as we know
[03:18:36.120 --> 03:18:41.720]  what the original language meant with militia and of course they like to play with the definition
[03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:48.360]  of terms to try to get what they want, but they've tried eight times to throw that out and say,
[03:18:48.360 --> 03:18:53.080]  well, we're just going to let people who have been here, regardless of where they were born,
[03:18:53.080 --> 03:18:57.080]  if they lived in America and they were a citizen for 35 years, we're going to let them run for
[03:18:57.080 --> 03:19:02.360]  president or if they were here for 20 years or whatever. They did that multiple times,
[03:19:02.360 --> 03:19:06.760]  it was a bipartisan effort. Some of these eight attempts to remove natural-born
[03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:12.440]  citizen were done by Republicans, some were done by Democrats and this was before Obama
[03:19:12.440 --> 03:19:19.160]  became president and it's absolutely amazing to me that so many people who had an issue
[03:19:19.160 --> 03:19:24.920]  with Barack Obama have no issue with Ted Cruz's not being a natural-born citizen.
[03:19:25.800 --> 03:19:28.200]  Now, according to the official story, if we believe it,
[03:19:30.600 --> 03:19:35.640]  Obama had an American parent, one American parent, it was born on American soil.
[03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:40.200]  Well, Ted Cruz wasn't even born on American soil according to this official story.
[03:19:40.200 --> 03:19:44.680]  So, but we give him a pass because he's part of the GOP establishment,
[03:19:44.680 --> 03:19:49.480]  but they're going to betray him in a brokered convention. They're already talking about how
[03:19:49.480 --> 03:19:53.240]  they're going to throw Ted Cruz out if you let them get away with this. Stay with us,
[03:19:53.240 --> 03:19:55.240]  we'll be right back with the reporters on the road.
[03:19:55.240 --> 03:20:08.440]  December 7th, 1941. A date which will live in infamy.
[03:20:08.440 --> 03:20:14.280]  75 years ago, America suffered one of the worst moments in American history,

[03:22:04.920 --> 03:22:10.440]  select quote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance. A while back, a man called me who had
[03:22:10.440 --> 03:22:15.720]  had prostate cancer. He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had
[03:22:15.720 --> 03:22:21.720]  given him. I said, let me see. Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly
[03:22:21.720 --> 03:22:27.240]  rated price competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium
[03:22:27.240 --> 03:22:33.240]  way below what he had been quoted. When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches
[03:22:33.240 --> 03:22:39.320]  select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price

[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:05.960]  Coast Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying
[03:23:05.960 --> 03:23:11.560]  the young bucks in head to head fitness tests. How is this even possible? Turns out the old guys in
[03:23:11.560 --> 03:23:16.200]  this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain a youth drink
[03:23:16.200 --> 03:23:21.400]  called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers
[03:23:21.400 --> 03:23:26.520]  that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack of energy a thing in the past. Previously,
[03:23:26.520 --> 03:23:32.520]  this drink was only available to elite military units. But for a limited time, the creator Patriot
[03:23:32.520 --> 03:23:38.360]  Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs specifically for our conservative
[03:23:38.360 --> 03:23:42.920]  friends. But you must act fast. Due to the high demand from members of the Coast Guard,
[03:23:42.920 --> 03:23:48.280]  our supply is extremely limited right now. To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens,

[03:23:57.320 --> 03:24:18.440]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on this fourth hour. We're
[03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:22.520]  going to be going to our reporters in Wisconsin. We've got Rob Dew, Richard Reeves lined up to
[03:24:22.520 --> 03:24:28.360]  talk to us. We also have Joe Biggs coming up. And of course, he's been on the East Coast looking at
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:35.080]  the much discussed democracy spring. Turns out it was a total flop. He's going to tell us about that
[03:24:35.080 --> 03:24:41.000]  as well as the Amtrak train derailment that was nearby. He's got some information about that. And
[03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:46.200]  an interview with the father of one of the Bin Laden seal team. All that is coming up with Joe
[03:24:46.200 --> 03:24:50.120]  Biggs. And of course, we're going to be going to Rob Dew and Richard Reeves in Wisconsin
[03:24:50.120 --> 03:24:55.080]  in just a moment. Before we do, I want to let you know about the new products that we've got. Of
[03:24:55.080 --> 03:24:58.920]  course, this was just introduced, I think it was last week, our vitamin mineral fusion. Now,

[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:33.640]  in Wisconsin. I think Rob do. We've got him on first, so he's in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Rob, are you
[03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:40.920]  there? Yes, I'm here. We're in southern Milwaukee right now in our hotel, just uploading more videos.
[03:26:40.920 --> 03:26:45.960]  We shot a lot of video footage yesterday, including a kind of a two-part series that we put on the
[03:26:45.960 --> 03:26:52.600]  Alex Jones channel, where these, after all the Trump supporters went inside some militant black,
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:58.600]  their group is called F Your Flag, hashtag F Your Flag. They came over, brought American flag,
[03:26:58.600 --> 03:27:04.200]  set it in front, on the grass, started spitting on it and stomping on it. And then they saw me
[03:27:04.200 --> 03:27:10.440]  as an infowars reporter and they wanted to talk to me. They were mad that we had
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:15.000]  Professor Griff on the show. They called names and some of the other people we've had on the show
[03:27:15.000 --> 03:27:18.760]  asked them about Minister Farrakhan. They said, well, I'm not a, I'm not a nation of Islam, so I
[03:27:18.760 --> 03:27:22.280]  don't care. Did they want to talk to you or do they want to throw you on the ground and spit on
[03:27:22.280 --> 03:27:27.480]  you like the flag? No, I actually did about an 11-minute interview that people can watch and
[03:27:27.480 --> 03:27:32.280]  see for themselves. You know, the one thing I didn't have in my back pocket was the article
[03:27:32.920 --> 03:27:38.680]  by who Paul Joseph Watson came out May 5th of 2015, black crime facts that the white liberal
[03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:44.600]  media dare not talk about. And one of which, because I asked him about black on black crime and why
[03:27:44.600 --> 03:27:50.200]  it's so high. And he said, well, that's just because blacks are around each other. And what I
[03:27:50.200 --> 03:27:57.640]  didn't have was the fact, despite being outnumbered by whites five to one, blacks commit eight times
[03:27:57.640 --> 03:28:02.920]  more crimes against whites than vice versa, according to FBI statistics from 2007. The
[03:28:02.920 --> 03:28:07.880]  black male is 40 times as likely to assault a white person as in reverse. And these facts
[03:28:07.880 --> 03:28:11.640]  that doesn't really, you know, his first thing is, well, it's just because we're around each other.
[03:28:11.640 --> 03:28:18.280]  I mean, that's not much of a defense to say that. I'm going to get the guy, I'm a criminal,
[03:28:18.280 --> 03:28:22.120]  so I'm going to hit the person closest to me. I mean, that's not much of a defense, is it?
[03:28:23.000 --> 03:28:30.440]  I agree. It's not. And a couple of veterans, they were trying to grab the flag from them off the
[03:28:30.440 --> 03:28:36.280]  ground. And, you know, the police actually had to come in and break it, break it up before it got
[03:28:36.280 --> 03:28:40.120]  worse. But then before the Trump rally got out, they picked up their flag and they,
[03:28:40.120 --> 03:28:46.200]  and they walked off there. They were done after, you know, they, because they knew if, if a bunch
[03:28:46.200 --> 03:28:51.880]  of veterans came out, like the veterans I talked to before they went in, I talked to a bunch of
[03:28:51.880 --> 03:28:55.400]  veterans. And, you know, if those guys would have came out, I think it would have been a different
[03:28:55.400 --> 03:29:00.600]  story. And, you know, not that I'm calling for violence in any way. But, you know, when you
[03:29:00.600 --> 03:29:04.520]  go there with that kind of provocateur reaction, you will get a reaction you may not like.
[03:29:04.520 --> 03:29:10.280]  That's right. That's right. It's not simply about, when I covered this in Washington, D.C.,
[03:29:11.080 --> 03:29:14.520]  they weren't there to exercise their free speech. They're standing there chanting
[03:29:14.520 --> 03:29:19.880]  three words repetitively. And I tell you, the police that were protecting, that were separating them
[03:29:19.880 --> 03:29:24.200]  from the crowd going into that event, if they were not Trump supporters by the end,
[03:29:25.240 --> 03:29:29.720]  nothing would convert them because it drives people away from your point of view. You're not
[03:29:29.720 --> 03:29:34.120]  trying to persuade anybody. You're simply trying to shut down free speech. You're trying to annoy
[03:29:34.120 --> 03:29:38.760]  people. You're not. It's not anything that's persuasive at all. I don't understand why they
[03:29:38.760 --> 03:29:42.280]  think this is going to be a very effective tactic. Stay with us. We're going to be right back with
[03:29:42.280 --> 03:29:51.160]  our reporters Rob Do, Richard Reeves, and Wisconsin. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.960 --> 03:29:54.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:29:54.840 --> 03:30:05.000]  A leaked memo reveals how the Trump campaign really feels about the establishment.
[03:30:05.000 --> 03:30:10.920]  An internal memo leaked to the Washington Post reveals the level of disdain that Trump has
[03:30:10.920 --> 03:30:17.000]  for the political establishment and their talking heads in the mainstream media. The memo entitled
[03:30:17.000 --> 03:30:22.360]  Digging Through the Bulls**t is written by Donald Trump senior advisor Barry Bennett,
[03:30:22.360 --> 03:30:27.160]  who said the mainstream media and Washington establishment are working together like never
[03:30:27.160 --> 03:30:34.040]  before to bash the Trump campaign. As the networks have labeled last week, the worst week ever for
[03:30:34.040 --> 03:30:40.040]  Donald Trump, and they are proclaiming that the end is near for his presidential campaign. The memo
[03:30:40.040 --> 03:30:46.680]  goes on to point out the disconnect between Trump's rising popularity and the media talking points.
[03:30:46.680 --> 03:30:53.000]  Another pathetic display by the so-called experts who line their pockets at the expense of our
[03:30:53.000 --> 03:31:18.120]  candidates and causes. You can learn more right now at infowars.com.

[03:33:20.840 --> 03:33:24.040]  Reeves, our reporters in Wisconsin. We're just talking to Rob Dew. We're going to go back to
[03:33:24.040 --> 03:33:28.600]  them just a moment. And then we're going to talk to Joe Biggs, our reporter who is on the east coast
[03:33:28.600 --> 03:33:34.360]  in Pennsylvania, covering the democracy spring. But he also got some footage of the Amtrak
[03:33:34.360 --> 03:33:39.720]  train derailment. And he had an interview there with a father of one of the Bin Laden seal teams.
[03:33:39.720 --> 03:33:43.400]  So we're going to be talking to Joe Biggs after our reporters in Wisconsin. Let's go back to
[03:33:43.960 --> 03:33:48.680]  Rob Dew and Richard Reeves in Wisconsin. Rob, tell us about this video that you've got the one
[03:33:48.680 --> 03:33:54.520]  lonely Trump protester. Yeah, that's correct. It's got about 30,000 views. The mainstream local
[03:33:54.520 --> 03:34:00.760]  media showcases single Trump supporter. And it happened after the rally in Wasu, which is the
[03:34:00.760 --> 03:34:06.440]  central part of Wisconsin. And when we pulled up, we saw three people protesting with signs.
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:12.600]  And we go inside and there's at least a thousand people just listening to Trump that didn't even
[03:34:12.600 --> 03:34:17.640]  get into the rally. Well, then the rally ends, people start pouring out, we're interviewing people,
[03:34:17.640 --> 03:34:21.400]  talking to them. Did you see any protesters? No, I haven't seen any. I haven't seen any protesters
[03:34:21.400 --> 03:34:25.960]  anywhere. Have you ever seen this many people at this place before? No, never. The line extended
[03:34:25.960 --> 03:34:31.960]  all the way around this giant mall. And then as we're leaving, we're driving by and the local
[03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:36.840]  media has a shot set up. And yeah, you can see the photo right there. That's the mainstream
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:41.720]  media on the other side of that tree with their shot set up. And I even go to their
[03:34:41.720 --> 03:34:45.880]  new shot in the video, you can go see their new shot and they have it set up where that one
[03:34:45.880 --> 03:34:51.480]  protester is there. So they want to show that. And then there was an article from
[03:34:52.520 --> 03:34:57.800]  some local newspaper. They kind of had the USA Today outline. So I think they're affiliated
[03:34:57.800 --> 03:35:04.840]  with USA Today. And they have all their photos set up. Hardly any of them show Trump supporters.
[03:35:04.840 --> 03:35:09.240]  There might be one or two that they show. And then it shows like an empty parking lot.
[03:35:09.240 --> 03:35:13.720]  And then it goes to a couple more little shots of, but you can see like one or two people,
[03:35:13.720 --> 03:35:19.400]  not the thousands of people that were lined up, no lines around the block. Like I've seen at every
[03:35:19.400 --> 03:35:23.640]  Trump rally I've gone to lines around the block. I have yet I've talked to people have gone to
[03:35:23.640 --> 03:35:28.040]  Ted Cruz rallies. They have yet to say any of them. There was over a thousand people at a rally.
[03:35:28.040 --> 03:35:33.320]  So I don't understand how one. No, there was a there was a rally just recently Rob where they
[03:35:33.320 --> 03:35:39.240]  had Heidi Cruz and Carly Fiorina and they couldn't get more than 50 people to show up to listen to
[03:35:39.240 --> 03:35:43.320]  the two of them. And that's typically what you see in these kind of political events. I've
[03:35:43.320 --> 03:35:47.560]  covered a lot of these at the state and local level, even races that are at the top of the ticket,
[03:35:47.560 --> 03:35:53.240]  races for Senate, races for governor and even presidential races. You don't get that many
[03:35:53.240 --> 03:35:58.360]  people to show up. It's amazing to see thousands of people show up. And we've only seen that a
[03:35:58.360 --> 03:36:03.800]  few times. You saw that for Obama. We saw it for Ron Paul. We see it for Trump. There's our shot
[03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:09.000]  there. Yeah, there you go. An hour after we got there. That was the whole hour after we got there.
[03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:13.400]  I mean, after the event started, we got there at four, the event started at three. And there were
[03:36:13.400 --> 03:36:18.680]  still thousands of people hanging out listening to Trump. And they weren't even in the arena.
[03:36:18.680 --> 03:36:22.920]  They were just listening in the hallway. And we saw the same thing in Jamesville.
[03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:27.480]  We see I saw the same thing in Washington, D.C. They had the Verizon Center there where APAC was
[03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:32.840]  going on. Now that was not a Trump rally. There is the one guy that was not a Trump rally. It was
[03:36:32.840 --> 03:36:38.040]  an APAC convention that he and other presidential candidates were speaking at. But of course,
[03:36:38.040 --> 03:36:42.920]  the drive by media goes up and says, look at this, there's thousands of protesters. There were not
[03:36:42.920 --> 03:36:48.520]  thousands of protesters. There were maybe 50. And they were surrounded by the police. So it's very
[03:36:48.520 --> 03:36:53.240]  easy to identify who they were if you actually looked at it. There was a crowd of 15,000 people
[03:36:53.240 --> 03:36:57.480]  going into that arena. And they were being snaked back and forth in a very long line.
[03:36:58.360 --> 03:37:03.160]  Like you see people being controlled going into a riot at Disney World, for example. But if you
[03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:08.120]  just take a still picture of that and put that up on the internet, it looks like a mass crowd of
[03:37:08.120 --> 03:37:12.280]  people. But it was a very distinct difference between these protesters who are dressed like
[03:37:12.280 --> 03:37:17.560]  your standard hippies holding signs and the people who are wearing suits and ties and Yamakas going
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:22.280]  into APAC. It was very easy to distinguish those two. You couldn't get that mixed up if you were
[03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:29.000]  the media unless you really wanted to get it mixed up. Yeah. And yesterday at Nathan Hale
[03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:34.200]  High School, during the show, I was showing Alex, look, here's all the people lined up for Trump.
[03:37:34.200 --> 03:37:39.880]  You turn around mainstream media cameras all at the group. And by that time, it was a very small
[03:37:39.880 --> 03:37:45.720]  group of protesters, probably 25. And I'm being generous by saying 25. Now, by the end, there
[03:37:45.720 --> 03:37:49.560]  were more protesters, especially when people were coming out, they were screaming at them and stuff
[03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:55.560]  like that. And then you had the militant blacks coming in doing their protest. So people are
[03:37:55.560 --> 03:38:00.120]  taking advantage of this opportunity where Trump's going to speak to try to get whatever their message
[03:38:00.120 --> 03:38:04.680]  is out. And it's not a very clear message. I talked to some young kids who are in high school,
[03:38:04.680 --> 03:38:09.960]  had no idea the IRS carries guns. They didn't believe me. And I said, we've interviewed a gun
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:14.760]  carrying IRS agent, kids. Okay. And guess what? They kill people if you don't pay taxes. Go look
[03:38:14.760 --> 03:38:19.480]  it up. Go look it up. Don't believe me. Please don't believe me. And then I'm surprised. You've
[03:38:19.480 --> 03:38:24.680]  got the BLM that kills people if you're going to a meeting to explain to people how you ought to
[03:38:24.680 --> 03:38:29.000]  have different kind of policies to manage the lands that they claim that they own.
[03:38:29.000 --> 03:38:32.520]  Well, that's one kind of media hypocrisy. I want to talk to Richard Reeves. He's got a different
[03:38:32.520 --> 03:38:40.040]  kind of media hypocrisy, basically given Hillary Clinton a pass when she engages somebody at a rally
[03:38:40.040 --> 03:38:42.840]  that asked her a hostile question. Richard, tell us about that.
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:47.640]  Well, I think many people have probably seen that video already. Hopefully you've got it there
[03:38:47.640 --> 03:38:51.640]  where you can show it where Hillary really blew up at a little green piece activist.
[03:38:51.640 --> 03:38:58.120]  I guess it was Thursday or Friday of last week. And Hillary got up in this young lady's face,
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:03.000]  pointing a finger at her, really angry, saying, I'm tired of the Bernie Sanders people lying
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:10.120]  about the fossil fuel money, et cetera. And had that been Donald Trump, having an episode like
[03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:15.960]  that, getting up in a young girl's grill and wagging a finger and getting angry like that,
[03:39:15.960 --> 03:39:19.240]  we'd probably hear that out of the mainstream media for a month.
[03:39:19.240 --> 03:39:22.760]  Yeah. Hang on, Richard. Let's play that clip. They've got that cute up. Let's play that clip.
[03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:25.400]  So people are watching this and people on the radio can hear that.
[03:39:43.320 --> 03:39:46.760]  Well, she really got angry. I had not seen that clip before. And of course,
[03:39:46.760 --> 03:39:51.480]  people are watching that, people who aren't watching that. She gets frowned on her face
[03:39:51.480 --> 03:39:56.040]  and puts her finger right in that young lady's face and is laughing or like that.
[03:39:56.040 --> 03:40:00.280]  So yeah, if Trump had done that, you can bet that would have been the leading news everywhere.
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:05.880]  But of course, Richard, they gave her a pass this weekend too. When she stuck her foot in it,
[03:40:05.880 --> 03:40:12.120]  as far as the abortion people are concerned, she was asked if an unborn child had constitutional
[03:40:12.120 --> 03:40:16.040]  rights and she continued on with that. She didn't correct him and say it's not a child.
[03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:22.920]  It's a fetus. And so they let that go. And of course, that is anathema to the abortionists.
[03:40:22.920 --> 03:40:27.560]  They don't want the child referred to as a child. They don't refer to as a person.
[03:40:27.560 --> 03:40:31.720]  And yet she was using that terminology and even talking about abortion and that connection
[03:40:31.720 --> 03:40:35.400]  when it's supposed to be terminating a fetus. Understand it's terminating a fetus.
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:39.960]  Right. And that's exactly what I was going to say is she did use that terminology. It was just
[03:40:39.960 --> 03:40:45.320]  yesterday on one of the Talking Head Sunday programs when she said that basically an unborn
[03:40:45.320 --> 03:40:50.360]  person does not have constitutional rights. That's not the exact verbiage. But basically,
[03:40:50.360 --> 03:40:55.320]  that was the question. Does an unborn child have constitutional rights with the question?
[03:40:55.320 --> 03:41:00.040]  And she answered it. Basically, no, an unborn person does not have those rights.
[03:41:00.040 --> 03:41:04.040]  And that's the whole crux of it is personhood. That's what they have said about that. And we're
[03:41:04.040 --> 03:41:08.280]  going to break that down in detail tonight because she goes through all the talking points.
[03:41:08.280 --> 03:41:12.600]  She talks about, well, we've modified the Constitution with the Supreme Court. It's
[03:41:12.600 --> 03:41:18.200]  now the law of the land. And it's like baloney. Look at the process for modifying the Constitution.
[03:41:18.200 --> 03:41:21.800]  There's nothing about Supreme Court decisions. And we've had the Supreme Court come in and say,
[03:41:21.800 --> 03:41:26.840]  hey, you got to turn back runaway slaves. You don't have First Amendment rights if you have a
[03:41:26.840 --> 03:41:31.880]  movie. We've had all kinds of nonsense come out of the Supreme Court that has subsequently been
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:37.800]  reversed. It is not amending the Constitution. They don't write law. They're supposed to apply
[03:41:37.800 --> 03:41:43.240]  the law and judge the law. They aren't supposed to write it and aren't supposed to amend the
[03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:47.800]  Constitution. But we treat it that way. We need to expose that language because it's very important
[03:41:47.800 --> 03:41:53.640]  how they use the language just as important as using terms like child and person to say that it
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:58.760]  is now the law of the land, that it is now the constitutional process. It's very important to
[03:41:58.760 --> 03:42:02.600]  expose that. Well, thank you, Richard. And Rob, before we run out of time, I want to get to Joe
[03:42:02.600 --> 03:42:08.360]  Biggs. He's waiting for us in Pennsylvania. We'll be checking back in with you guys in Wisconsin.
[03:42:09.560 --> 03:42:15.240]  Thanks. Let's go to Joe Biggs now in Philadelphia. Actually, somewhere in Pennsylvania, I guess he's
[03:42:15.240 --> 03:42:19.400]  not in Philadelphia anymore. Joe, where are you? Yeah, I'm in Philadelphia. I'm actually on the
[03:42:19.400 --> 03:42:27.320]  Rocky steps. If you actually pan over here and look, you can see up here, they actually took
[03:42:27.320 --> 03:42:31.160]  down the Rocky statue. I guess there's no love for Rocky in Philadelphia anymore. They actually
[03:42:31.160 --> 03:42:35.400]  moved him to the bottom of the stairs off over here in a construction area. So I thought that was
[03:42:35.400 --> 03:42:39.880]  kind of interesting. That's kind of low achieving if he's not at the top of the steps, right?
[03:42:39.880 --> 03:42:44.280]  Yeah, I know. But you know, Philadelphia is going to be, you know, Pennsylvania is going to be an
[03:42:44.280 --> 03:42:51.720]  interesting state because we saw earlier this month, 46,000 Democrats switched over to Republican
[03:42:51.720 --> 03:42:57.320]  simply to vote for Donald Trump this election. And in Massachusetts, you have 20,000 Democrats
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:01.160]  who did the exact same thing. So everything that you're seeing being portrayed in the mainstream
[03:43:01.160 --> 03:43:06.360]  media is mostly false because there are tons of people in record numbers who love Trump.
[03:43:06.360 --> 03:43:11.640]  Even the union guys, the teamster guys who can't even come out publicly saying it yet,
[03:43:11.640 --> 03:43:16.120]  but they really do like Trump. I spoke with a bunch of guys the other day. There's some guys
[03:43:16.120 --> 03:43:20.920]  that even said that if Trump even comes out and mentions how he supports unions, he supports the
[03:43:20.920 --> 03:43:25.080]  teamsters, these guys are going to switch over from Democrat, they're going to vote Republican,
[03:43:25.080 --> 03:43:29.960]  they're going to vote Donald Trump in Pennsylvania because, hey, you've got Philadelphia and you
[03:43:29.960 --> 03:43:35.880]  got Pittsburgh, two huge union cities in the state, then you got Boston, you got all these
[03:43:35.880 --> 03:43:40.280]  other places. So if he comes out and supported that, Donald Trump's going to get a lot more
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:45.720]  votes in these states as well. We haven't seen this kind of movement of blue collar Democrats
[03:43:45.720 --> 03:43:51.400]  since Ronald Reagan. And at this time, when Ronald Reagan was running 36 years ago,
[03:43:51.400 --> 03:43:56.760]  at this time in the election, he was 15 points behind an incumbent president.
[03:43:56.760 --> 03:44:01.320]  And everybody was saying, Ronald Reagan can't win. But Ronald Reagan did win,
[03:44:01.320 --> 03:44:05.720]  mainly because of the migration of people who understood how they were being screwed by the
[03:44:05.720 --> 03:44:11.720]  system. And it's far worse now because now we've got NAFTA that's been in place for 23 years.
[03:44:11.720 --> 03:44:15.960]  And we've got these Trans-Pacific, Transatlantic partnerships that are coming up. People need
[03:44:15.960 --> 03:44:23.080]  to understand that Ted Cruz wrote an op-ed piece a year ago, April 2015, with Paul Ryan talking
[03:44:23.080 --> 03:44:29.560]  about how that was free trade, how it was essential. He shut down the efforts by Senator Session to
[03:44:29.560 --> 03:44:36.040]  stop the movement of the Trade Promotion Authority, which essentially denied the constitutional process
[03:44:36.040 --> 03:44:41.560]  to ratify these treaties. Ted Cruz says he's a constitutionalist, and yet he pushed to shut
[03:44:41.560 --> 03:44:51.080]  down the TPA, which says we're not going to have a 67 vote majority to push forward a treaty.
[03:44:51.080 --> 03:44:55.240]  We're simply going to have a majority in both houses, and we're not going to have any amendments.
[03:44:55.240 --> 03:44:59.080]  We're not going to have any discussion. We're not going to have any filibustering. Ted Cruz,
[03:44:59.080 --> 03:45:03.560]  Mr. Constitution, voted to shut that down. Of course, the second vote that they had,
[03:45:03.560 --> 03:45:07.880]  they didn't need his vote. So he switched his vote so he could say, well, he voted against the TPA.
[03:45:07.880 --> 03:45:12.440]  But that's the kind of lying lawyer that manipulates everything that Ted Cruz is,
[03:45:12.440 --> 03:45:16.920]  and people need to understand that he is with the establishment of both parties
[03:45:16.920 --> 03:45:21.640]  who want to push through these trade agreements. And I think even though Bernie Sanders says
[03:45:21.640 --> 03:45:25.960]  that he's against the TPP and the TTIP, I have absolutely no confidence
[03:45:25.960 --> 03:45:31.960]  that he has the force of personality where he can oppose the establishment of both the Democrats
[03:45:31.960 --> 03:45:35.720]  and the Republicans who want to get these through, even if he were elected president.
[03:45:35.720 --> 03:45:40.200]  I believe that Trump could, and I believe Trump would because he would use the people.
[03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:44.600]  Tell us what you saw there in terms of the Amtrak derailment, Joe.
[03:45:45.160 --> 03:45:51.320]  Well, yesterday I got out there about an hour and a half after the crash happened,
[03:45:51.320 --> 03:45:56.760]  and I was able to, I mean, you could see from a mile away what was going on. Cops everywhere,
[03:45:56.760 --> 03:46:02.520]  you know, union workers, people on the track, Amtrak workers, investigation trucks and things
[03:46:02.520 --> 03:46:06.120]  like that, people out there conducting all these investigations. And they had that whole area
[03:46:06.120 --> 03:46:10.840]  essentially locked down, but I was able to find a walkway between two houses and get up on the
[03:46:10.840 --> 03:46:14.520]  railroad and get a little bit of footage for a minute before I kind of got chewed away.
[03:46:14.520 --> 03:46:22.680]  But, you know, this is 2016. It's a railroad. It goes one way, you know, back and forth.
[03:46:22.680 --> 03:46:27.960]  You can't tell me that in 2016, we don't have a way to devise to notify these workers that
[03:46:27.960 --> 03:46:32.120]  that's going to be a so-called hot track where there's going to be a train coming through
[03:46:32.120 --> 03:46:36.600]  and to not have that equipment on there. You know, this thing moves at over a hundred miles
[03:46:36.600 --> 03:46:40.760]  an hour through that location in Chester, Pennsylvania, and that's through a very rural
[03:46:40.760 --> 03:46:44.760]  area. There's a lot of homes and everything through there. So that train was going fast through there
[03:46:44.760 --> 03:46:49.400]  and it hit these two guys. One of the guys was working for Amtrak for 40 years. The other guy,
[03:46:49.400 --> 03:46:55.320]  20 years, these guys had experience. Maybe that experience made them complacent. I don't know,
[03:46:55.320 --> 03:46:59.800]  but this is definitely something fishy going on and seeing this how not even a year ago,
[03:46:59.800 --> 03:47:05.720]  30 miles north of that, actually in Philly, you have that deadly train crash that happened as well.
[03:47:07.560 --> 03:47:12.360]  You know, Joe, when we look at this and we'll get to the report about Ben Laden,
[03:47:12.360 --> 03:47:16.440]  the SEAL team father, probably in the next segment, when we look at this and we look at how
[03:47:17.000 --> 03:47:24.360]  hard the government is pushing the self-driving car network, that's a far more complex situation.
[03:47:24.360 --> 03:47:29.880]  As you pointed out, we got a train on tracks and they can't control that. And yet the government
[03:47:29.880 --> 03:47:35.320]  wants to control every single one of our cars and control all these events that are going to be
[03:47:35.320 --> 03:47:39.640]  coming onto the road, people that are not cars or pedestrians, various other things that are
[03:47:39.640 --> 03:47:45.720]  going to be happening. That ought to make everybody very, very concerned just about the safety issues
[03:47:45.720 --> 03:47:50.440]  there. But of course, the reason the government is promoting this and the reason the government is
[03:47:50.440 --> 03:47:55.240]  giving Google a pass, even though the state of California says we're not too happy with Google's
[03:47:55.240 --> 03:47:58.840]  record with a smart car, so we're going to put some restrictions on them. Now they go to the
[03:47:58.840 --> 03:48:02.680]  federal government so they can get these state restrictions off. They're not concerned about
[03:48:02.680 --> 03:48:07.400]  your safety. They're concerned about two things. The corporation wants profits and the government
[03:48:07.400 --> 03:48:12.360]  wants control of your movement. It is a control grid that they're trying to impose on people.
[03:48:12.360 --> 03:48:17.960]  And so they're willing to sacrifice your safety. When they can't even manage, in this day and age,
[03:48:17.960 --> 03:48:22.840]  they can't even manage a railroad situation. Whereas you pointed out is simply a train moving
[03:48:22.840 --> 03:48:28.200]  down some tracks. Exactly. You know, another interesting thing as well though, Bernie Sanders
[03:48:28.200 --> 03:48:33.720]  supporters, you know, the reason I'm in Philadelphia is for the fact that on Saturday, there was the
[03:48:33.720 --> 03:48:38.920]  democracy spring was supposed to be the largest civil uprising in America. There was, you know,
[03:48:38.920 --> 03:48:44.520]  thousands of people who went on democracyspring.org and pledged to be here and not move unless
[03:48:44.520 --> 03:48:49.400]  they were arrested until their demands are met. And Saturday, the democracy spring started
[03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:54.520]  and there were about 300 people. Those guys marched to Ridley Park police station,
[03:48:54.520 --> 03:48:59.640]  which is 15 miles south and it got cold that night, dropped into the 30s. And in the middle of the
[03:48:59.640 --> 03:49:05.720]  night, 90% of those people bolted and went home. I guess he's Bernie Sanders supporters figured
[03:49:05.720 --> 03:49:11.240]  that some other people were actually going to show up for them protests and march for them to DC.
[03:49:11.240 --> 03:49:14.760]  And they figured maybe they could just show up there on the 11th and, you know, sit there and
[03:49:14.760 --> 03:49:19.320]  have a little occupy movement and camp out and get all smelly and start infighting and
[03:49:19.320 --> 03:49:22.360]  look ridiculous at the end of the day. You know, it doesn't seem like they have,
[03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:27.640]  I mean, here they got 300 people. And as Rob was just pointing out in Wisconsin,
[03:49:27.640 --> 03:49:32.920]  they got 1000 more people that could fit into the venue, standing there listening to the speeches.
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:39.560]  It's amazing when you look at the disparity and support between the democracy spring and the
[03:49:39.560 --> 03:49:44.920]  leftist, the Black Lives Matter people and the people who want to take our country back
[03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:50.040]  from these multinational globalists who are shutting us down by opening up the borders,
[03:49:50.040 --> 03:49:56.520]  by negotiating these trade agreements and having our trade managed offshore by a commission.
[03:49:56.520 --> 03:50:02.120]  That's what both of these trade agreements are going to do. And then also setting up an international
[03:50:02.120 --> 03:50:08.440]  global tax and calling it saving the world with a climate treaty. It's absolutely amazing to see
[03:50:08.440 --> 03:50:12.200]  that there's absolutely no support for this other side pushing that.
[03:50:12.200 --> 03:50:15.480]  And yet there's a lot of people who really understand what's going on with Donald Trump.
[03:50:16.600 --> 03:50:21.080]  Yeah, exactly. I mean, you know, when you come out to these events and you
[03:50:22.200 --> 03:50:25.960]  talk to these people, you know, I met a lot of common ground. I found a lot of common ground
[03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:29.720]  with a lot of these Bernie supporters and I broke down. I was like, how a lot of these guys are
[03:50:29.720 --> 03:50:33.720]  very similar. And I was like, what are you going to do if Hillary Clinton essentially stills this
[03:50:33.720 --> 03:50:38.520]  from the more popular vote on the Democrat side, which would be Bernie, because he has more people
[03:50:38.520 --> 03:50:42.520]  showing up. Obviously, people are showing up in mass numbers. You don't see large groups of people
[03:50:42.520 --> 03:50:45.720]  with Hillary Clinton t-shirts running around. You see large groups of people with Hillary for
[03:50:45.720 --> 03:50:51.320]  prison t-shirts running around, you know, you know, so you're right. The DNC is going to be held
[03:50:51.320 --> 03:50:55.960]  here in Philadelphia and it's two weeks apart, I believe, from the RNC. Stay there. We're going
[03:50:55.960 --> 03:50:59.400]  to come right back to you, Joe. We'll be right back with Joe and he's going to tell us about the
[03:50:59.400 --> 03:51:05.320]  father of bin Laden, SEAL team. And at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack and was

[03:54:04.600 --> 03:54:09.160]  Watchman! David Knight here for the Alex Jones show. This is our final segment. We're going to
[03:54:09.160 --> 03:54:14.600]  be going back to Joe Biggs in Philadelphia in just a moment. He conducted an interview earlier with a
[03:54:15.720 --> 03:54:19.880]  father of one of the Bin Laden SEAL team. And we're going to talk to him about that.
[03:54:19.880 --> 03:54:23.800]  Before we go back to Joe, I just want to let you know that we still have Anthroplex,

[03:54:55.080 --> 03:55:01.640]  of our new limited run. That's infowhereslife.com. Joe, we've talked about a lot of things that
[03:55:01.640 --> 03:55:06.440]  you were there. Of course, you went to cover the Democracy Spring and of course, only about 300
[03:55:06.440 --> 03:55:13.080]  people showed up. It was a big flop there, but you also saw the Amtrak derailment. We talked
[03:55:13.080 --> 03:55:18.360]  about that, but you interviewed one of the fathers of one of the members of the Bin Laden
[03:55:18.360 --> 03:55:23.000]  Seal Team Six. Tell us what he had to say. Yeah, it's a really interesting story. I mean,
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:28.600]  people really need to go and look into Extortion 17. If you haven't already done so thus far,
[03:55:28.600 --> 03:55:32.680]  you know, I had an opportunity. There's a guy who actually hit me up on Twitter the other day
[03:55:32.680 --> 03:55:36.760]  and says, hey, do you know about Extortion 17? I said, yeah, of course. He goes, well, I know the
[03:55:36.760 --> 03:55:42.760]  father of one of the guys. I'm going to put you in touch with him. And his name is Charlie Strange.
[03:55:42.760 --> 03:55:49.480]  His son was Michael Strange. He was a code breaker in the Navy. And he actually was with
[03:55:49.480 --> 03:55:54.760]  Seal Team Six in the Bin Laden raid. And he was part of the mission, the Extortion 17,
[03:55:54.760 --> 03:56:02.440]  when the Chinook went down, killing 15 Seal Team Six members. Another group of Navy guys
[03:56:02.440 --> 03:56:09.640]  from the West Coast, his son, Charlie, I mean, his son, Michael, and a group of other army guys,
[03:56:09.640 --> 03:56:14.760]  reservists, and some other elite people as well. You know, it's an interesting situation. They
[03:56:14.760 --> 03:56:21.080]  were going to try to save these Rangers who were being held down by a combat of fire.
[03:56:21.080 --> 03:56:25.480]  And they decided to do something which is really weird, which is why it makes a whole Bin Laden
[03:56:25.480 --> 03:56:29.880]  thing look strange, why it makes this whole situation look strange. They took some of the top
[03:56:29.880 --> 03:56:36.040]  elite tier operators and put them on one helicopter. That's ridiculous. There was a helicopter flying
[03:56:36.040 --> 03:56:40.280]  behind them that had no one in it. You would think you would take this kind of people,
[03:56:40.280 --> 03:56:46.200]  the Seal Team Six guys are most elite soldiers in the military. These guys are the top. And you
[03:56:46.200 --> 03:56:51.720]  would think you would separate them in case an RPG hits a helicopter. It takes down only some of the
[03:56:51.720 --> 03:56:55.880]  group. I interviewed Charlie Strange a couple of years ago, and I remember him talking about how
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:57:01.960]  they violated all the protocol rules. But then what really got him started on this investigation
[03:57:01.960 --> 03:57:09.960]  was the fact that they covered up evidence and pictures that eventually surfaced showing some
[03:57:09.960 --> 03:57:13.240]  of these guys that they said had died in the crash, though it showed that they had been
[03:57:13.240 --> 03:57:17.000]  shot and other things had happened with them. And they gave them a book, if I remember correctly,
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:24.760]  that had blanked out pages in it and altered narrative as to what had happened. And so I
[03:57:24.760 --> 03:57:28.280]  remember talking to Charlie Strange, you've got a new interview with him that we've got up on our
[03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:35.960]  site, and people really need to take a look at this. They need to understand what is going on
[03:57:35.960 --> 03:57:42.120]  and how the government has operated in this cover-up mode and how they have betrayed these people
[03:57:42.120 --> 03:57:47.880]  that were in Seal Team Six and also dumped on their families. It's absolutely shameful.
[03:57:47.880 --> 03:57:51.560]  They believe that they knew something because the entire narrative behind the
[03:57:51.560 --> 03:57:56.040]  bin Laden thing is kind of wishy-washy. You're going after the most wanted man in the world,
[03:57:56.040 --> 03:58:00.680]  and then all of a sudden, you just dump them off in the ocean. I think these guys were going to
[03:58:00.680 --> 03:58:05.240]  say something. They got them all on one helicopter, and then they ended it right there. And now you
[03:58:05.240 --> 03:58:09.400]  know this is set up because I actually got to see the documents. I got to see all the stuff that
[03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:13.800]  no one gets to see. There were IEDs set up in that area. That was an ambush waiting to happen. That
[03:58:13.800 --> 03:58:18.760]  was planned. Yes, that's what surfaced with his investigation. And of course, we got a new interview
[03:58:18.760 --> 03:58:23.160]  with him. That's Joe Biggs got that up on our site. And there was another interview that we had a
[03:58:23.160 --> 03:58:27.480]  couple of years ago. It was Larry Klayman was representing him at the time. Join us tonight
[03:58:27.480 --> 03:58:48.920]  at 7 Central, 8 p.m. Eastern for the nightly news. Thanks, Joe.
