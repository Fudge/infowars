[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:10.440]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Bend Soap Company.
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:14.440]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:06.440]  Aaron Fullen here. As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access,
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:13.440]  not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt and kefir.
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:20.440]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria. But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:28.440]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:36.440]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:43.440]  From good news, self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes,
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:46.440]  since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:51.440]  For more information, check out fermentationfactor.com. That's fermentationfactor.com.
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:07:00.440]  It's easy to create your own powerful fermented foods, and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com. That's www.fermentationfactor.com.
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:06.440]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest half-year on record.
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:15.440]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions. Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:20.440]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:27.440]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now.
[02:07:27.440 --> 02:07:31.440]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have to raise prices too.
[02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:33.440]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:37.440]  I recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we have all known this was coming.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:40.440]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:47.440]  The fact is, you can eat at any time to save money today, and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:53.440]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to e-foodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:58.440]  You can bet your life on e-foods direct.
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:28.440]  E-foods direct.
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:35.440]  E-foods direct.

[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:46.440]  He gave you a phone?
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:47.440]  How do you give you a phone?
[02:08:47.440 --> 02:08:51.440]  You're trying up a gir... you on full stamps you on social security
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:54.440]  You got low income, you disability
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:55.440]  Hey, I have a question
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.440]  Okay, what's wrong with Romney again?
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:58.440]  Romney? He sucks
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:00.440]  Hey!
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.440]  Obama
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.440]  You got Obama phone?
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:06.440]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland, low minority got Obama phone

[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:10.440]  He gave us a phone
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.440]  He gave you a phone?
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:12.440]  How do you give you a phone?
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:16.440]  You're trying up a gir... you on full stamps you on social security
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:19.440]  You got low income, you disability
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:20.440]  Hey, I have a question
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:21.440]  Obama
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.440]  Obama phone
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:23.440]  Yes, everybody in Cleveland
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:26.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, Elmo, Elmo gone bad
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:28.440]  I'm in president, you know?
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:31.440]  Literally, guys, can we pull up Elmo real quick?
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:34.440]  Just a short clip of Elmo, because I don't mean to be mean
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:37.440]  But I'm sorry, this woman sounds like a demonic Elmo
[02:09:37.440 --> 02:09:40.440]  Everybody get Obama phone!
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:41.440]  I can't even do it
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:46.440]  And I've got the guys finding him, we're compiling a bunch of people
[02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:49.440]  A bunch of different ones that you're not hearing anywhere on talk radio
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:51.440]  Because I remembered him, we're finding some of them
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:53.440]  Listeners are sending him to us, there's dozens of these things
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.440]  With people going, oh, thank you, Mr. President
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:58.440]  I'm going to get a free car and a free house in Florida and women going
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:10:00.440]  Mr. President, I want a free house
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:03.440]  He's like, alright, I'll get it for you, don't worry, absolutely
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:05.440]  Oh, you're going to fight there, baby cakes
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:06.440]  Remember that four years ago?
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:07.440]  I don't do a very good Obama
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:09.440]  I can do a Bill Clinton
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:13.440]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:15.440]  We do have Elmo
[02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.440]  Listen to her carefully, because
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:19.440]  Go ahead
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:20.440]  Petunia
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:21.440]  No
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:22.440]  No, okay
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:24.440]  Sesquipadeli
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:25.440]  No
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:27.440]  It's not really Elmo
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:30.440]  I'm telling you, that woman sounds like
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:33.440]  The Grouch, I don't know, it sounds like some muppet
[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:35.440]  I've let my kids watch Sesame Street a few times
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:37.440]  It does
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:40.440]  I'm sorry, I just love that woman's voice
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:43.440]  I guarantee you, we need to find her as a talent search
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:45.440]  I could give her comedy lines
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.440]  She would be the biggest sensation in the country
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:52.440]  Yeah, who's that?
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:55.440]  Oscar the Grouch
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:57.440]  It's like Oscar the Grouch
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:59.440]  It's like Oscar the Grouch
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:01.440]  It's like Oscar the Grouch
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:03.440]  It's like Oscar the Grouch
[02:11:03.440 --> 02:11:05.440]  It's like Oscar the Grouch
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:07.440]  It's like Oscar the Grouch
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:09.440]  It means Cookie Monster
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:12.440]  It means, I don't know, I'm done, turn it off
[02:11:12.440 --> 02:11:14.440]  Oh man, I can't handle it anymore
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:16.440]  You know why the globalists take talk radio?
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.440]  Because it's unscripted
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:21.440]  Coming up at the end of the hour, we're going to air excerpts
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:24.440]  Of the NSA report that's up at prisonplanet.tv
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:27.440]  InfoWars reporters confronted by NSA and San Antonio
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:29.440]  You heard the former CNN journalist, the whistleblower
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:31.440]  About the cover-ups
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:33.440]  She was just on saying, somebody ought to go
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:35.440]  Show these big NSA buildings
[02:11:35.440 --> 02:11:37.440]  Everybody's talking about the new big one in
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:40.440]  Utah, spawned on everybody
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.440]  What about down in San Antonio?
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:44.440]  They arrest reporters and take their film
[02:11:44.440 --> 02:11:47.440]  Not us, we were there with the printout
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:49.440]  Where they lost a lawsuit in Maryland over this
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:51.440]  Saying journalists couldn't take video or photos
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:53.440]  Of their base there
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:55.440]  We were like to the cops and the NSA feds with them
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:57.440]  Here you go, get ready for the lawsuit
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:59.440]  And they didn't arrest them
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:02.440]  They only snatch and grab people they think are dumb
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:04.440]  Because they think you're dumb and won't know
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:06.440]  How to defend yourself in court
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:08.440]  I'm telling you, this whole road to tyranny
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.440]  Is paved with ignorance
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:12.440]  And that's why they want you dumbed down
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:14.440]  And dependent on government
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:15.440]  So that's about a four-minute report
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:16.440]  We'll be airing at the end of the show
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:18.440]  Also, I'm going to air the Judge Dredd
[02:12:18.440 --> 02:12:20.440]  Jacari Jackson report that ties into the drones
[02:12:20.440 --> 02:12:22.440]  And the police state
[02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:24.440]  And why are so many movies about dystopias
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:26.440]  While they're conditioning us in the culture
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:28.440]  In the last 50 years, they call it predictive
[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:30.440]  Programming to just accept
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:32.440]  This new future, this agenda 21
[02:12:32.440 --> 02:12:34.440]  Mega city future
[02:12:34.440 --> 02:12:36.440]  Now, I wanted to get him on
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:38.440]  Because I know that he has railed
[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.440]  About this on his own popular
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:42.440]  California syndicated radio show
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:44.440]  He's on some of our affiliates
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:46.440]  KSCO and others out there
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:48.440]  And he joins us now
[02:12:48.440 --> 02:12:50.440]  Because he had been on, I don't know, a month or two
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:52.440]  And he's backed by popular demand
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:54.440]  Dr. Corey Gold
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:56.440]  Has his doctorate and dental surgery
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:12:58.440]  From the University of California
[02:12:58.440 --> 02:13:00.440]  San Francisco in 1988
[02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:02.440]  He's got a bunch of other degrees
[02:13:02.440 --> 02:13:04.440]  In biology and a minor in chemistry
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:06.440]  He's got a bachelor in biology
[02:13:06.440 --> 02:13:08.440]  And a minor in chemistry from California State University
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:10.440]  Fuller Tender received a bachelor's degree
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:12.440]  In dental sciences from the University of California
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:14.440]  San Francisco, he's the co-founder
[02:13:14.440 --> 02:13:16.440]  And president of pro-Java
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:18.440]  International and noted
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:20.440]  Product formulator
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:22.440]  And it just goes on and on
[02:13:22.440 --> 02:13:24.440]  And he's exposed, but a pioneer exposing
[02:13:24.440 --> 02:13:26.440]  What's happening with the families
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.440]  Of children with autism, spectrum disorders
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:30.440]  And more. I wanted to get him on
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:32.440]  About the new big French study
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:34.440]  But there's a bunch of others showing rats fed
[02:13:34.440 --> 02:13:36.440]  Monsanto corn
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:38.440]  One type alone had
[02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:40.440]  70% of them died
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:42.440]  Young, one of the females
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:44.440]  50% of the males
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:46.440]  Giant tumors growing
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.440]  Twice as fast
[02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:50.440]  More tumors. This is what a lot of other studies show
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:52.440]  I wanted to get into that with him
[02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:54.440]  But first, Doc, because I know you cover other stuff
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:56.440]  What do you make
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:58.440]  Of all these videos coming out
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:00.440]  Of Obama supporters
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:02.440]  Running around thinking they're going to get
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:04.440]  Free goodies, free phones
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.440]  Which he's done. And now
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:08.440]  They go, and there's more. I'm going to get
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:10.440]  More free stuff
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:12.440]  As soon as Obama gets in
[02:14:12.440 --> 02:14:14.440]  I mean, that's what Benjamin Franklin talked about
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:16.440]  Democracy is
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:18.440]  Two wolves and a sheep
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:20.440]  Voting on what's for dinner
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:22.440]  And then people say, how dare you be against democracy
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.440]  We're a republic
[02:14:24.440 --> 02:14:26.440]  You might want to tell folks what that is
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:28.440]  It means that 51% say
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:30.440]  Hey, we voted to kill the other 49
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:32.440]  Sorry, you can't do that. There's basic
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:34.440]  Liberties that are enshrined
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:36.440]  Rule of law. But hey, you know
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.440]  She's like, hey, take everybody's stuff
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:40.440]  I want Obama phone
[02:14:40.440 --> 02:14:42.440]  But it's worse than that. You've got
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:44.440]  A lot of other corporate welfare people
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:46.440]  The big megabanks
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:48.440]  They're not out there saying I want my Obama phone
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:50.440]  Like a muppet, but they are
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:52.440]  In terms of our taxpayer money
[02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:54.440]  Dr. Gold, give us your take on this
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:56.440]  First off, Elmo
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.440]  Free phone was just priceless
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:15:00.440]  And by the way, that's what it's like out there
[02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:02.440]  To some degree. It's like, please reelect Obama
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:04.440]  Because we didn't get enough stuff in the last
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:06.440]  Four years. I still want my iPad
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:08.440]  I want my Obama iPad. I need my
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:10.440]  Obama laptop. I need my Obama
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.440]  You know, SUV
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:14.440]  I need my Obama stuff
[02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:16.440]  She literally thinks everybody in her city is going to get free gear
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.440]  If they reelect Obama
[02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:20.440]  It's priceless
[02:15:20.440 --> 02:15:22.440]  And it's scary
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.440]  That that is so prevalent in the community out there
[02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:26.440]  It's just so amazing
[02:15:26.440 --> 02:15:28.440]  That they're voting thinking
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:30.440]  If I vote for this individual
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:32.440]  I'm going to get a bunch of free electronic gear
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:34.440]  And that's why she vote for somebody
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:36.440]  It's not about education
[02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:38.440]  It's not about the security of your nation
[02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:40.440]  It's not about your independence and liberty
[02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:42.440]  It's about, can I get some free electronic gear
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:44.440]  It's like going to fries electronics
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:46.440]  Can I get some free electronics if I vote for you
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:48.440]  In the NFL Wars magazine
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.440]  We have subscriptions available at
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:52.440]  InfoWarsStore.com
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:54.440]  Evil, evil capitalism
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:15:56.440]  Folks where you support
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:58.440]  Ideas that you think are important and free speech
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:00.440]  Freely
[02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:02.440]  By free association
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:04.440]  Not MSNBC getting a half billion dollars
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:06.440]  In taxpayer stimulus money
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:08.440]  To give raises
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:10.440]  To their little globalist minions
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:12.440]  No, no, we don't come with a gun
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:14.440]  Like the government and make you buy
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:18.460]  But I break down in here the technocracy where MIT and others are saying soon
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:22.160]  They're just gonna have a brain implants that they're gonna say treat
[02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:28.720]  Depression where your wire heads Philip K. Dick wrote about this 30 years ago where you'll have unlimited pleasure centers
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:33.780]  Stimulated, but it'll be a government controlled chip and we're not very far away from this
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:37.000]  You know 20 years ago. They had remote control cockroaches now
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.180]  They've got vaccines that go in and reprogram the brain so that you're never depressed again
[02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:45.340]  They reprogram it by eating areas of the brain that are associated with depression
[02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:50.440]  I mean, we're really here in a brave new world and that segues us in to
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:58.400]  the cancer studies the the in the rats so these aren't the first but now the Russians are banning GMO corn
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:02.120]  The French are going crazy burning down the crops that have been planted
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:09.040]  But but but here we're in a giant test tube doc as you know, and we're leading the world in cancer and
[02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:13.140]  Well, every other disorder break down what you think's really going on here
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:18.520]  Well, Fran and some companies in France did studies on the GMO corn by Monsanto
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:23.880]  And it showed that over a two-year period of time that the rats had had that food source
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:30.200]  Did much more poorly than the rats that had regular corn. In fact, they had a higher rate of cancer and many other things and
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:36.000]  So a lot of those are reading those studies and saying we don't want this, you know, we don't want to eat this food
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000]  I can't get Obama phone
[02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:45.200]  Yeah, your Obama phone, but but then Monsanto's response was wait a second your studies weren't long enough
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:52.340]  To show any damage the studies done to show damage were two years long. The safety studies were 90 days long
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:56.240]  It's just hilarious. Your studies weren't long enough to show damage
[02:17:56.280 --> 02:18:01.840]  They were two years and the studies that said that was safe was 90 days by Monsanto
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:08.200]  And by the way, I got by the way funded by Monsanto people they admit on that study at the bottom that it was funded by Monsanto
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.640]  Right, so the Russians, you know, you can say what's the will about them, but they can read the data and they're like
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:18.800]  I don't think we want this, you know, just getting rapid cancers not something we want to take a risk on and
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:23.600]  By the way, I got all three of my topics before my topics all involved Monsanto
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:30.680]  Monsanto today is the number one donor in the state of California to defeat proposition 37
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:36.800]  Proposition 37 in California says that if GMOs are in foods, it should be on the labels and
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:43.920]  25 million dollars has been spent to defeat this and only about a million dollars to support it because you know
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.400]  It's just grassroots and you look at the supporters. I mean like who is supporting this ban
[02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:54.640]  You know, you think this openness, you know, wasn't Barack Obama supposed to be all about fairness and openness and a more
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:57.560]  You know, we're gonna all be telling the truth society
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:02.960]  Monsanto four million dollars to make sure you don't know that GMOs are in your food in California
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:09.680]  DuPont over four million dollars to make sure that you don't know GMOs are in your food in California Pepsi BASF
[02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:20.560]  Goes on Coca-Cola Nestle Bay or Dow all spending millions of dollars in the state of California to tell you that you shouldn't have the
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:22.280]  choice to know
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:27.920]  That GMOs are in your food. They're gonna try to convince you with millions of dollars in the state of California
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:34.720]  That you should not have the right to know if GMOs are not matters if I get an Obama phone
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:37.640]  Right, you know, it's like do you want to know about GMOs or not?
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:43.840]  If you don't you get an Obama phone like well in that case, you know, what the heck Cheryl Crowe says the cell phone gave her a brain
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:47.160]  Trim around the study show that too, but whatever as long as you get an Obama phone
[02:19:47.160 --> 02:19:53.360]  All right, we'll be right back with dr. Corey gold to break down his four topics. I wanted him on I said did what do you want?
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:55.320]  Come on about I said, whatever you want to cover, bro
[02:19:55.320 --> 02:20:00.280]  I know you're really informed about all this so he's gonna break down Monsanto and a lot more
[02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:05.540]  Aaron full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers
[02:20:05.760 --> 02:20:09.160]  Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:13.600]  But the healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir
[02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:17.640]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria
[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:22.880]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history
[02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:28.880]  With archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today
[02:20:29.040 --> 02:20:31.760]  Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges
[02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:35.920]  Koreans eat kimchi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:36.960]  But here's some good news
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:43.000]  South for lion Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes
[02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:49.280]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself for more information check out fermentation factor calm

[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:08.560]  I want you to know some very important information in 1985
[02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:15.840]  President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class
[02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:17.440]  Healer now

[02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:27.220]  On the nightly news tonight, I'm gonna play a bunch of
[02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:31.000]  Clips of people thinking they're gonna get free houses free cars from Obama
[02:24:31.760 --> 02:24:35.880]  Listeners are finding them all over the place mainstream media is only running two or three of them
[02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:40.960]  We've got a whole bunch of them. It'll be on the nightly news tonight and in this Sunday four to six
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:45.680]  I'll be live with a Sunday radio show. I'm gonna air this report
[02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:50.160]  But we're putting together the problem is there's just too many of them and you're watching this stuff
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:55.120]  You think it's a joke folks. It isn't a joke. It's like we run America now. We're getting free stuff
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:24:57.520]  We're gonna take your money. I mean
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:01.440]  That's just everything the founders warned us about now. Let's shift gears
[02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000]  Back to dr. Corey gold
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:10.440]  Monsanto and others. What is it like 20 million now? They've spent in California Monsanto and others together. It's like 19 million a few days ago
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:11.880]  Now it's 20 million
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:17.360]  Two weeks ago was like 16 million. It's growing millions every week to not let you have the food labeled
[02:25:17.360 --> 02:25:22.040]  In Europe now, they're restricting getting vitamins South Korea. You can't get vitamins
[02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:27.840]  I was told this by guy who lived in South Korea. I wouldn't looked it up. It's true unless you go to a pharmacy and get a prescription
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:34.280]  They're trying to go after everything now. I mean these people are killing us. There's no doubt that
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:41.840]  Look, this isn't an accident every major GMO food that gets studied of its cross species is reducing fertility and that stuff added to it
[02:25:41.840 --> 02:25:48.480]  Then there's no way it could always be bad. I mean, I'm not even against some genetic manipulation if it's properly tested
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:50.640]  There's no way this is an accident doc
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:57.400]  Well, I mean the whole irony of it is is we have a president in the office right now who came with hope and change and
[02:25:57.960 --> 02:26:02.960]  Transparency and so in California. We said, hey, how about being transparent and just tell us what's in the food
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:06.160]  We're not even saying ban it. We're just saying tell us if it's in there
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:07.480]  We'll make our own
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.480]  Decisions, you know what to do like maybe a pink like you do for peanut labeling and other things
[02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:16.200]  You tell us what kind of fats are in food just those GMOs are there or not and we'll make a decision ourselves
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:19.720]  And they're saying no we'll tell you if there's peanuts in the food
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:22.160]  but we won't tell you if there's GMO in the foods and
[02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:27.520]  You know, they're actually paying 25 million stuff to almost 26 million dollars right now
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:31.280]  So that you won't have the ability to make decisions for yourself
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:36.040]  You won't have the ability to go look at and save yourself, you know, I've done the research myself
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:41.280]  I don't want that food. I've done the last time I saw was 20 mil. It's now 26 mil
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:45.680]  It's 26 million as of today and the and the group supporting it
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:48.320]  Which is just you know average everyday people, you know
[02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:52.840]  They got a million million and a half and that's just from like people like you and I donating 50 bucks a pop
[02:26:52.880 --> 02:26:57.360]  The average donation right now to defeat proposition 37 is like
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:04.080]  $600,000 so you're not talking everyday people only 44 donations have been made
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:09.960]  44 companies have made donations to defeat proposition 37 so they're all a coca-cola and Pepsi
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:12.840]  Conagra Pepsi when I saw this two years ago
[02:27:12.840 --> 02:27:18.000]  I didn't believe that Pepsi go had a division making flavoring out of dead babies in China
[02:27:18.040 --> 02:27:20.440]  Because they got to do something with them and it was true
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:25.840]  And then they ruled this year that shareholders can't even go to the meeting and demand it be taken out
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:33.320]  I mean these it's just they have suicide nets around the Apple factories in China and have forced abortions on the site
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:41.480]  I mean we're in a science fiction nightmare and when these so-called liberals get in control all hell breaks loose because they're not
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:46.520]  Liberals, they're not trying to domesticate us to help us. They want to control us
[02:27:46.920 --> 02:27:51.760]  Well your freedom to know what you what you want to know as long as it's what the government wants you to know
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:54.000]  I mean you would think that the government would say listen
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:59.440]  We want an educated, you know group of people you make decisions yourself. We're telling you how much fats in the food
[02:27:59.440 --> 02:28:01.000]  We're telling you how much carbohydrates in the food
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.440]  We're gonna tell you if there's GMO or not. Well, no wait a second
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:07.680]  You can't know if there's GMO because we be afraid that if you knew there was GMO in the food
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:09.800]  You would elect not to purchase it
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:16.120]  Therefore you cannot know because we don't want you having a decision not to buy something you don't want
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:19.760]  That's what it is. They know that if you know you'll avoid it
[02:28:19.760 --> 02:28:23.760]  In fact, they say this is the like the battleground if California bans
[02:28:23.760 --> 02:28:30.840]  Oh allows GMO labeling on the food that would wipe out the GMO industry because nobody in California will be a ban
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:36.760]  By by voting with the dollars, right? It's over. We're just not gonna buy their crud anymore, right?
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:40.880]  In Japan right now it's required China right now it requires it France now requires it
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:48.280]  But the United States, you know, they're trying to block you knowing something that's so we're such a joke because we think we're so free
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:50.280]  We're becoming totally enslaved
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:52.280]  well about this
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:57.880]  Report out by a public public citizen organization, which I'm not part of in any way. It's and that's a public group
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:03.160]  It's not it related to the Republican or Democratic Party. They just did a study that 30 billion dollars
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:08.080]  Has been fined to big pharma over the last 20 years and they say that's only
[02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.480]  Basically, they they had to pay fines worth about 2% of the profits
[02:29:13.480 --> 02:29:16.640]  They made on illegal marketing tactics in other words
[02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:22.000]  They were telling you that certain drugs were good for you for certain things that they were never proven to be good for
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:25.920]  In other words, take this drug for this condition, but we have no evidence to support you
[02:29:25.920 --> 02:29:29.960]  We even need it or it turned out they knew that it was actually bad for you. Oh, yeah
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:33.720]  We got that too with a bad. Let's break that down when we get back folks
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:41.960]  They get a 2% fine for knowingly putting HIV in your factor 8 blood product for 11 years that killed hundreds of thousands
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:49.200]  And then the documents came out. They knew and liked it. They like killing you. They're eugenicists. I'll be right back
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:57.120]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:13.160]  Cheeses but to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir
[02:32:13.160 --> 02:32:17.200]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria
[02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:23.040]  But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:29.800]  Archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso
[02:32:29.800 --> 02:32:35.400]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living
[02:32:35.520 --> 02:32:36.720]  But here's some good news

[02:33:00.220 --> 02:33:02.220]  you
[02:33:30.220 --> 02:33:38.220]  The stage is setting out, pay the price, it's an eco-post, don't think twice.
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:41.220]  Technology, the battle's unfair.
[02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:44.220]  Yeah, technology, the battle's unfair.
[02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:48.220]  And humans are seen as animals by the globalist.
[02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:54.220]  And they've got the drones, the technology, the soft kill weapons and the food and the water.
[02:33:54.220 --> 02:34:01.220]  And they're hitting us and hitting us hard, but not only can you avoid the poisons,
[02:34:01.220 --> 02:34:08.220]  you could also use the building blocks, the key full-spectrum vitamins, minerals and trace elements
[02:34:08.220 --> 02:34:13.220]  to empower your body to reverse a lot of this and the science is there.
[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:19.220]  And yes, I've got Dr. Corey Gold on the breakdown of the news, he's a great syndicated talk show host
[02:34:19.220 --> 02:34:24.220]  of presentations in his own right, but he's also, look at this right here.
[02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:26.220]  I almost forgot to plug this.
[02:34:26.220 --> 02:34:35.220]  He's also one of the most successful developers as a chemist, biologist, dentist, doctor
[02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:40.220]  of some of the best-selling products in the world, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:48.220]  That's why I was so honored when I said, hey, I'd like to work with you on something that is branded to Alex Jones.
[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:52.220]  I'm so proud of the products you developed, all my favorite products are the ones he developed.
[02:34:52.220 --> 02:34:53.220]  And he said, well, it's funny.
[02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:57.220]  I'm thinking about doing a berry-flavored pollen burst that has even more antioxidants,
[02:34:57.220 --> 02:35:02.220]  along with all the B vitamins and minerals and the pollen extract that's in there.
[02:35:02.220 --> 02:35:03.220]  It's so incredible.
[02:35:03.220 --> 02:35:04.220]  And I'm like, are you kidding?
[02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:06.220]  Pollen burst is my favorite.
[02:35:06.220 --> 02:35:07.220]  I don't like energy drinks.
[02:35:07.220 --> 02:35:08.220]  They make me feel weird.
[02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:12.220]  This doesn't do it because it does it with the vitamins and the minerals and it's got the caffeine,
[02:35:12.220 --> 02:35:15.220]  I guess from a natural, what is it, green tea in there.
[02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:19.220]  And it gives me more of a boost than three cups of coffee, even though it has a lot less caffeine,
[02:35:19.220 --> 02:35:21.220]  because it synergistically works.
[02:35:21.220 --> 02:35:28.220]  And when you purchase it at MFullWarsHealth.com or MFullWarsTeam.com or anywhere else for that matter,
[02:35:28.220 --> 02:35:31.220]  it supports the broadcast and what we're doing.
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:37.220]  So as you can see on the packaging, as featured on the Alex Jones show, it's a win-win-win-win-win.
[02:35:37.220 --> 02:35:38.220]  I promote gold.
[02:35:38.220 --> 02:35:41.220]  That was at $245 an ounce 11 years ago.
[02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:46.220]  And I said it would go up because of global currency devaluation when they detonated the derivatives bomb.
[02:35:46.220 --> 02:35:48.220]  Exactly as I said it happened.
[02:35:48.220 --> 02:35:49.220]  Not a rocket scientist.
[02:35:49.220 --> 02:35:50.220]  I've studied history.
[02:35:50.220 --> 02:35:53.220]  I know about why my republics in Bobway, Argentina 12 years ago.
[02:35:53.220 --> 02:35:54.220]  I know where we're going.
[02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:56.220]  I said Europe would be in flames.
[02:35:56.220 --> 02:35:57.220]  It's begun.
[02:35:57.220 --> 02:36:00.220]  And I say, you know, filter your water.
[02:36:00.220 --> 02:36:01.220]  Don't drink fluoride.
[02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:03.220]  Harvard admits gives you brain damage and bone cancer.

[02:37:51.220 --> 02:37:54.220]  but the Alex Pack is up there discounted.
[02:37:54.220 --> 02:37:56.220]  It is all right there.

[02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:14.220]  Catherine at infowars.com.
[02:38:14.220 --> 02:38:22.220]  MZ at infowars.com and just a lot of other ways to get in touch with us there on the site.
[02:38:22.220 --> 02:38:27.220]  877-551-1301, infowarshealth.com.
[02:38:27.220 --> 02:38:31.220]  Doc, I want to get into all the other attacks and the battle that's joined
[02:38:31.220 --> 02:38:35.220]  and all these new medical reports and the cancer connected to the GMOs.
[02:38:35.220 --> 02:38:37.220]  But first off, let's do a little more plugging here.
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:40.220]  We're midair refueling and funds are freedom.
[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:45.220]  Not the government who comes with a gun and takes money and then uses it to finance anti-family globalist garbage.
[02:38:45.220 --> 02:38:47.220]  And I want to get into the attack on the family.
[02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:51.220]  Michelle Obama running what your kids eat all over the country now.
[02:38:51.220 --> 02:38:53.220]  Not just it started in Illinois three years ago.
[02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:59.220]  There's Chicago mafia model where evil parents can't pack lunches for their children as the state owns them.
[02:38:59.220 --> 02:39:01.220]  Now that's spreading nationwide.
[02:39:01.220 --> 02:39:03.220]  I mean, a real dark age here happening.
[02:39:03.220 --> 02:39:09.220]  But before we do that, tell people about why Polymers Plus and Polymers is so special and so revolutionary.
[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:12.220]  Well, by the way, thank you for all those kind words.
[02:39:12.220 --> 02:39:16.220]  Yeah, in some ways, we're not even parents of our children anymore.
[02:39:16.220 --> 02:39:18.220]  We kind of just keep them in our houses as well.
[02:39:18.220 --> 02:39:22.220]  The government allows us to and they tell us what to do and we just kind of do it for them.
[02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:27.220]  Polymers, it's a fantastic product that we started creating several years ago with.
[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:32.220]  We wanted a drink product that people would enjoy taking, not a medicine product.
[02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:40.220]  People would enjoy taking that would have a wide spectrum of essential minerals, vitamins, amino acids, and it would.
[02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:42.220]  And it would also give them natural energy.
[02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:46.220]  So if you mentioned we have the green tea extracts in there and that has an energy component to it.
[02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:52.220]  But it also has these great things called ECGCs, which are naturally very powerful polyphenols, which are antioxidants.
[02:39:52.220 --> 02:39:55.220]  And your body loves antioxidants.
[02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:59.220]  Plus it has something in there called SOD, superoxide dismutase.
[02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:02.220]  And your body loves SOD.
[02:40:02.220 --> 02:40:04.220]  In fact, your body makes SOD.
[02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:06.220]  It's the chemical that your body makes.
[02:40:06.220 --> 02:40:09.220]  It's one of three antioxidants that your body naturally makes on its own.
[02:40:09.220 --> 02:40:17.220]  We have the only proven source of SOD that can be taken through a drink or a pill product and be absorbed into the body.
[02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:19.220]  It's not something we say.
[02:40:19.220 --> 02:40:24.220]  It's something that's been scientifically proven and actually patented and we're very proud that we're using it.
[02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:27.220]  It's difficult to use and we're proud that we're using it well.
[02:40:27.220 --> 02:40:31.220]  So your body can really absorb that SOD and gets great antioxidant benefit.
[02:40:31.220 --> 02:40:37.220]  And most of the listeners know that SOD and antioxidants are really important in your immune system,
[02:40:37.220 --> 02:40:44.220]  preventing sun damage, helping cells repair, and trying to keep away things like cancer and other things like that.
[02:40:44.220 --> 02:40:47.220]  In addition to that, you've got your vitamin D.
[02:40:47.220 --> 02:40:50.220]  We all need vitamin D, more and more evidence coming out on that.
[02:40:50.220 --> 02:40:54.220]  And we're not sprinkling just tiny little bits of things to put them into the label.
[02:40:54.220 --> 02:40:57.220]  We're actually putting functional doses into them.
[02:40:57.220 --> 02:41:00.220]  We have all the B vitamin D spectrum, vitamin A.
[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:03.220]  We have the flower pollen micronutrient complex in there.
[02:41:03.220 --> 02:41:05.220]  We're very proud of what's in there.
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:07.220]  And it's low in calories.
[02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:08.220]  It tastes great.
[02:41:08.220 --> 02:41:13.220]  Your kids will enjoy taking it and they'll think they're getting something that's a treat as opposed to a punishment.
[02:41:13.220 --> 02:41:16.220]  And you just feel natural energy when you take it.
[02:41:16.220 --> 02:41:17.220]  And I'm an adult.
[02:41:17.220 --> 02:41:23.220]  I don't want to feel like some of these drinks do where I feel jittery or I don't want to feel like I'm getting hot and sweaty.
[02:41:23.220 --> 02:41:25.220]  I don't want to feel like I can't go to sleep.
[02:41:25.220 --> 02:41:33.220]  I want to feel I have empowered with natural energy so I can sweep my garage if I want to or I can sit down and read a book if I want to.
[02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:36.220]  That's the kind of energy I want.
[02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:42.220]  Now let's shift gears back into what you were breaking down there, Dr. Corey Gold here.
[02:41:42.220 --> 02:41:49.220]  We got cut off by the break and you were starting to get into, well, just the full spectrum of what's going on.
[02:41:49.220 --> 02:41:53.220]  Well, we were talking before about $30 billion in fines to big pharma.
[02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:57.220]  And that includes like GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Abbott Labs.
[02:41:57.220 --> 02:42:04.220]  Those pharmaceutical companies make about two-thirds of that $30 billion or about $20 billion in fines.
[02:42:04.220 --> 02:42:07.220]  But those fines are a drop in the bucket.
[02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:08.220]  Think about this.
[02:42:08.220 --> 02:42:10.220]  Glaxo had a drug called Avandia.
[02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:18.220]  And they had research on Avandia that showed it had a huge increase in heart attack and other fatal risk side effects.
[02:42:18.220 --> 02:42:20.220]  And they didn't tell anybody.
[02:42:20.220 --> 02:42:29.220]  And now they're estimating, public citizens is estimating that 50,000 to 100,000 people may have died prematurely by taking this drug.
[02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:32.220]  And yet they only had to pay a very small fee.
[02:42:32.220 --> 02:42:40.220]  If you or I were to do something and cause the deaths of some people or the harm to people, we go to jail.
[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:42.220]  But nobody in their group is going to jail.
[02:42:42.220 --> 02:42:47.220]  They pay a small percentage of their profit back and happily they keep working.
[02:42:47.220 --> 02:42:49.220]  It's kind of like they're paying off the government.
[02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:51.220]  Hey, listen, you did some really bad things.
[02:42:51.220 --> 02:42:53.220]  You pushed them drugs that didn't work.
[02:42:53.220 --> 02:42:55.220]  Some of them may have killed some people.
[02:42:55.220 --> 02:42:58.220]  Some may have not been right for that particular disease entity.
[02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:00.220]  Some may have been overpriced.
[02:43:00.220 --> 02:43:01.220]  Who knows what?
[02:43:01.220 --> 02:43:04.220]  Just give us a couple percentage points back and keep on going into business.
[02:43:04.220 --> 02:43:05.220]  So you help fund us.
[02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:06.220]  We help fund you.
[02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:08.220]  We all merely go along.
[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:09.220]  It's crazy.
[02:43:09.220 --> 02:43:16.220]  You would think that if somebody put knowingly hid a scientific evidence that could have saved lives, they'd be in jail.
[02:43:16.220 --> 02:43:20.220]  But instead, they're just busily making their next drug.
[02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:22.220]  It's crazy.
[02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:24.220]  You're right.
[02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:36.220]  I want to shift gears into an area here because we now have all over the United States, the federal government coming in and saying GMOs are good.
[02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:38.220]  We want you to drink fluoride that kills you.
[02:43:38.220 --> 02:43:41.220]  Harvard studies, that's all admitted.
[02:43:41.220 --> 02:43:45.220]  We want to force all these inoculations on you.
[02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:48.220]  We want to put Ritalin and Prozac in you.
[02:43:48.220 --> 02:43:51.220]  We want to let big pharma kill you on record.
[02:43:51.220 --> 02:43:53.220]  Gardasil killed a bunch of people in the trials.
[02:43:53.220 --> 02:43:57.220]  So they have government mandated to give vaccine liability protection.
[02:43:57.220 --> 02:43:59.220]  But all that's okay.
[02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:08.220]  Michelle Obama, they say, decides what you eat and now parents can't pack the lunches from Denver, Colorado to Chicago, Illinois.
[02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:11.220]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:44:11.220 --> 02:44:14.220]  Where is all this going?
[02:44:14.220 --> 02:44:16.220]  Oh, it's just starting.
[02:44:16.220 --> 02:44:27.220]  For all of us who are maybe over the age of 40, when we remember back the happy days of our lives, our kids will not believe and our grandkids will not believe the kind of lives that we've led.
[02:44:27.220 --> 02:44:30.220]  Because they're not going to be able to go to the store and buy whatever they want.
[02:44:30.220 --> 02:44:33.220]  They're going to be buying what the government tells them to buy.
[02:44:33.220 --> 02:44:40.220]  Right now, if I was to hand my kid a lunch in Chicago, it's very likely it might be confiscated from that child.
[02:44:40.220 --> 02:44:44.220]  They told you your parents aren't qualified to make you a school lunch, a home lunch.
[02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:47.220]  Therefore, you have to eat what school gives you.
[02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:49.220]  But I discovered it's happening nationwide.
[02:44:49.220 --> 02:44:55.220]  And so they're even arresting kids for chalking the street at their own house, hopscotching.
[02:44:55.220 --> 02:44:58.220]  They're arresting Amish, front yard, backyard gardens.
[02:44:58.220 --> 02:45:00.220]  I mean, this government's a lunatic.
[02:45:00.220 --> 02:45:09.220]  Well, if they can take your kid's lunch away at school that you made as their parent, what's to say they can't tell you what you have to serve them for breakfast and dinner?
[02:45:09.220 --> 02:45:18.220]  No, no, no. The Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture, they said 10 years ago, I covered it.
[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:20.220]  They said, we're going to decide what you eat.
[02:45:20.220 --> 02:45:22.220]  You're going to have a national smart card.
[02:45:22.220 --> 02:45:23.220]  There's not going to be any more cash.
[02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:25.220]  We're going to track everything you do.
[02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:26.220]  We're going to tax you.
[02:45:26.220 --> 02:45:29.220]  And now Bloomberg's proposing all this.
[02:45:29.220 --> 02:45:30.220]  Well, yeah.
[02:45:30.220 --> 02:45:38.220]  I mean, in the whole vein of helping you out, they're going to take away your decision making because you're too stupid to make decisions.
[02:45:38.220 --> 02:45:42.220]  And if we let you make your own breakfast, lunch, and dinner, who knows what you might do?
[02:45:42.220 --> 02:45:45.220]  Therefore, for your own protection, we're going to put cameras in your homes.
[02:45:45.220 --> 02:45:48.220]  We're actually going to put barcodes on all your foods.
[02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:52.220]  We're going to weigh you every few weeks to make sure that you're weighing the right amount.
[02:45:52.220 --> 02:45:57.220]  And if your cholesterol goes up, we're going to mandate you take cholesterol-reducing medications.
[02:45:57.220 --> 02:46:04.220]  We are now basically your brain, and you're basically a walking vessel, and your children are not your own.
[02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:08.220]  You get to keep them as long as you play by our rules, which is do exactly what we say.
[02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:10.220]  So do I think we're going that way?
[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:13.220]  Unfortunately, I think we are.
[02:46:13.220 --> 02:46:14.220]  It's amazing.
[02:46:14.220 --> 02:46:21.220]  And, you know, you tell people the UN wants to ban all vitamins and minerals over the counter, even the adulterated crowd, most places to sell.
[02:46:21.220 --> 02:46:24.220]  And they're like, oh, that's not happening, even though it's on record.
[02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:27.220]  Codex momentary, you can go read it on the UN website.
[02:46:27.220 --> 02:46:33.220]  But I think the tyrants are rushing everything now because they know they followed the trajectory.
[02:46:33.220 --> 02:46:39.220]  They know that overall people that still aren't completely brain damaged are waking up and saying no.
[02:46:39.220 --> 02:46:42.220]  They can see their time of tyranny is coming to an end.
[02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:44.220]  The pendulum's starting to swing the other way.
[02:46:44.220 --> 02:46:52.220]  So they're racing in to try to clamp down now, and that's only backfiring on a more.
[02:46:52.220 --> 02:46:54.220]  I don't think they're going to get away with this.
[02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:55.220]  Well, I hope not.
[02:46:55.220 --> 02:47:01.220]  And you would think that people would instinctually somewhere in their gut start getting angry and say, wait a second, you got a song.
[02:47:01.220 --> 02:47:02.220]  We aren't going to take this anymore.
[02:47:02.220 --> 02:47:03.220]  One of my favorite songs.
[02:47:03.220 --> 02:47:06.220]  We're not going to take it.
[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:13.220]  You think it somewhere would rise up inside you and say, wait a second, you're actually proposing we don't know that GMOs are a food.
[02:47:13.220 --> 02:47:14.220]  Really?
[02:47:14.220 --> 02:47:16.220]  You're kidding me right now.
[02:47:16.220 --> 02:47:17.220]  That one you went too far on.
[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:20.220]  Really, you're telling us that it's bad for us to know.
[02:47:20.220 --> 02:47:27.220]  But so I think at some point, you know, right now you can go to some schools and they'll give you the morning after pill and they won't tell the parents.
[02:47:27.220 --> 02:47:33.220]  So, I mean, at some point, the parents have to say, wait a second, you can't be dealing with my 13 year old daughter that way.
[02:47:33.220 --> 02:47:43.220]  Those are family decisions, not your decision as a school to make about a morning after pill or driving a child to get an abortion or giving those kind of decisions.
[02:47:43.220 --> 02:47:44.220]  That should be a family decision.
[02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:47.220]  You live in California where they're already shooting them up without parental consent as young as what?
[02:47:47.220 --> 02:47:48.220]  Eleven.
[02:47:48.220 --> 02:47:49.220]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:54.220]  That is criminal to have a punk government saying, oh, your kid gave consent.
[02:47:54.220 --> 02:47:56.220]  You don't have consent till 18.
[02:47:56.220 --> 02:48:03.220]  I mean, that is the criminal's creed that, oh, you know, the kid gave consent to whatever the case was.
[02:48:03.220 --> 02:48:08.220]  Well, my younger one can't give consent to anything because she's not old enough to make consent.
[02:48:08.220 --> 02:48:09.220]  She's not a legal adult.
[02:48:09.220 --> 02:48:11.220]  And she doesn't even have a background to make those decisions.
[02:48:11.220 --> 02:48:20.220]  How can you have, even in the criminal court, say if somebody doesn't have the mental faculties, they can't be considered to be guilty because they didn't know what they were doing.
[02:48:20.220 --> 02:48:25.220]  How can my 16 year old have the mental capability or the background to know those decisions of that ramification?
[02:48:25.220 --> 02:48:27.220]  She can't.
[02:48:27.220 --> 02:48:28.220]  It's unbelievable.
[02:48:28.220 --> 02:48:32.220]  Well, we've got to have you back up very, very soon, Doc.
[02:48:32.220 --> 02:48:38.220]  Briefly spend a few minutes, though, here because, you know, we're not the government taking people's money and then using it against them.
[02:48:38.220 --> 02:48:41.220]  We know we're here free market promoting what we believe in.
[02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:48.220]  Voting with our dollars, buying organic with those who are voluntarily labeling it and getting it certified.
[02:48:48.220 --> 02:48:52.220]  And others move to not let milk companies say there's no GMO or no growth hormone.
[02:48:52.220 --> 02:48:56.220]  I mean, they don't even want you to be able to voluntarily say, hey, we're natural.
[02:48:56.220 --> 02:48:58.220]  Of course, natural doesn't mean anything.
[02:48:58.220 --> 02:49:02.220]  Now, you know, we're actually organic pesticide, herbicide, GMO free.
[02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:03.220]  There's that move.
[02:49:03.220 --> 02:49:09.220]  That's why now it's more important than ever to know who the best vitamin and mineral supplement companies are out there.
[02:49:09.220 --> 02:49:15.220]  Why is pollen bursts and things like Beyond Tangy Tangerine available at mfallwarshealth.com?
[02:49:15.220 --> 02:49:16.220]  Why is that?
[02:49:16.220 --> 02:49:21.220]  I mean, literally, heads above the rest compared to the competition out there.
[02:49:21.220 --> 02:49:23.220]  What makes it so special?
[02:49:23.220 --> 02:49:29.220]  And one of the types of things that these products can do for different degenerative problems and things that are out there.
[02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:36.220]  I mean, it really is a cornucopia of just miraculous things because your body is designed to run off this stuff.
[02:49:36.220 --> 02:49:39.220]  And there's the big secret hiding in plain view.
[02:49:39.220 --> 02:49:42.220]  Well, I'm one of those Bible Quingers that believes that we were divinely created.
[02:49:42.220 --> 02:49:48.220]  And I believe that our body was given, you know, innate abilities to do a lot of things to help heal it.
[02:49:48.220 --> 02:49:51.220]  Not everything, but most things.
[02:49:51.220 --> 02:49:53.220]  Your body has an intelligence to it.
[02:49:53.220 --> 02:49:58.220]  And if it's given the right minerals, I mean, it's almost crazy when you think about it.
[02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:01.220]  If somebody says, listen, you need to have your 60 essential minerals.
[02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:03.220]  You need to have your 60 essential vitamins.
[02:50:03.220 --> 02:50:05.220]  You need to have your 12 amino acids.
[02:50:05.220 --> 02:50:07.220]  You need to have your three omega oils.
[02:50:07.220 --> 02:50:10.220]  And somebody would say, you're crazy for listening to these people.
[02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:12.220]  You need to be on drugs and medications.
[02:50:12.220 --> 02:50:15.220]  You need to be on, you know, Aspartame.
[02:50:15.220 --> 02:50:17.220]  You need to be taking your Diet Coca-Cola.
[02:50:17.220 --> 02:50:19.220]  You need to be doing these things.
[02:50:19.220 --> 02:50:23.220]  And somebody out there says, listen, vitamins and minerals and amino acids are good for you.
[02:50:23.220 --> 02:50:24.220]  Those are the crazy folks.
[02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:26.220]  When I went to school, they said, listen, you are what you eat.
[02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:27.220]  That's right.
[02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:28.220]  Exactly.
[02:50:28.220 --> 02:50:31.220]  Fetal cells of dead babies and Pepsi good.
[02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:33.220]  You know, vitamins and minerals bad.
[02:50:33.220 --> 02:50:34.220]  Right.
[02:50:34.220 --> 02:50:40.220]  The people are telling you to eat well and eat organic and have pure water and try to have pure oxygen in your home
[02:50:40.220 --> 02:50:45.220]  and filtration and to have vitamins and minerals and to lower your gluten ratios.
[02:50:45.220 --> 02:50:46.220]  Those are the crazy people.
[02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:50.220]  Those of you are going and having like the fat substitutes and the sugar substitutes
[02:50:50.220 --> 02:50:52.220]  and going and having your vaccinations.
[02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:54.220]  Those are the same people.
[02:50:54.220 --> 02:50:58.220]  And somewhere along the way, people are going to have to say, it's 1984 all over again.
[02:50:58.220 --> 02:51:00.220]  I'm hearing crazy talk in my head.
[02:51:00.220 --> 02:51:04.220]  And eventually the light bulb has to go on and say, how can it be bad to supplement really?
[02:51:04.220 --> 02:51:05.220]  How can that be bad?
[02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:06.220]  Exactly.
[02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:11.220]  While we've done what the MDs say and the big pharma and we're leading the world in every horrible disease and cancer
[02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:12.220]  and you name it.
[02:51:12.220 --> 02:51:13.220]  Dr. Gold, thank you so much for the time.
[02:51:13.220 --> 02:51:14.220]  All right.
[02:51:14.220 --> 02:51:15.220]  Thank you, sir.
[02:51:15.220 --> 02:51:18.220]  All right, folks, as promised, we're going to skip this network break here.
[02:51:18.220 --> 02:51:21.220]  I'm really bad about this because I want to get the info out.
[02:51:21.220 --> 02:51:26.220]  Here is a report where I sent Melissa Melton and Jakari Jackson down to the NSA.
[02:51:26.220 --> 02:51:31.220]  They got another report coming up tonight on the RFID where they're making the kids wear RFIDs in San Antonio.
[02:51:31.220 --> 02:51:33.220]  This is a base almost as big.
[02:51:33.220 --> 02:51:39.220]  It's one of the biggest in the US as the one in DC, the one in Maryland, the one out in Utah.
[02:51:39.220 --> 02:51:40.220]  And no one talks about it.
[02:51:40.220 --> 02:51:45.220]  And they take the film of major newspaper and TV reporters, not ours.
[02:51:45.220 --> 02:51:46.220]  You know why?
[02:51:46.220 --> 02:51:49.220]  Because we presented them with a lawsuit they lost in Maryland.
[02:51:49.220 --> 02:51:52.220]  We presented them with that and got their attention.
[02:51:52.220 --> 02:51:56.220]  Hey, we're here to let you know what you're doing and there's illegal.
[02:51:56.220 --> 02:51:57.220]  Here's that report.
[02:51:57.220 --> 02:51:59.220]  Then we'll play the judge's dread breakdown.
[02:51:59.220 --> 02:52:01.220]  Here it is.
[02:52:01.220 --> 02:52:14.220]  We're here in San Antonio, Texas, about to cover a student RFID protest in just mere moments.
[02:52:14.220 --> 02:52:17.220]  We stopped here at this neighborhood Walmart to check for directions.
[02:52:17.220 --> 02:52:23.220]  And as you can see, we're surrounded by not only a Walmart, a GameStop, a Staples office supply store,
[02:52:23.220 --> 02:52:27.220]  but also a NSA data mining center.
[02:52:27.220 --> 02:52:34.220]  They got footage of them driving around the facility, which anybody can tape.
[02:52:34.220 --> 02:52:37.220]  But they come up and get in their face and threaten them and stuff.
[02:52:37.220 --> 02:52:39.220]  The audio is not that good.
[02:52:39.220 --> 02:52:42.220]  But you can see it if you're watching at PrismPlanet.tv.
[02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:45.220]  And we have it posted in the FullWars.com as well.
[02:52:45.220 --> 02:52:50.220]  And it's all about intimidation that, hey, we're going to spy on you illegally and you're not going to show video of us.
[02:52:50.220 --> 02:52:52.220]  What do you think this is, America?
[02:52:52.220 --> 02:52:56.220]  You know, you're all suspects, but we the government at the stage 9-11 and everything else.
[02:52:56.220 --> 02:53:01.220]  We're the good guys. Now take some cancer shots and your vaccines because we love you.
[02:53:01.220 --> 02:53:05.220]  Now, in 2008, and I wouldn't be surprised if it has happened again since then,
[02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:10.220]  a journalist was detained for 45 minutes for filming the then under construction NSA data mining center.
[02:53:10.220 --> 02:53:14.220]  We have been able to avoid detention here and we are not going to press our luck.
[02:53:14.220 --> 02:53:17.220]  This is Jakari Jackson for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[02:53:17.220 --> 02:53:21.220]  But a few minutes later driving away, they did get grabbed.
[02:53:21.220 --> 02:53:25.220]  Good to press your luck and then exercise your freedom of a free American and a free human.
[02:53:25.220 --> 02:53:32.220]  NSA, if you decide to confiscate this tape, we are truly looking for the visitor center and we would like to take a tour.
[02:53:32.220 --> 02:53:38.220]  They even said that on tape in case they took it. They would then watch him talking to them.
[02:53:38.220 --> 02:53:43.220]  Yeah, we're trying to find the visitor center. Do you guys do guided tours here? No, we don't.
[02:53:43.220 --> 02:53:46.220]  Do you guys have any like information we can take home or anything like that?
[02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:48.220]  Information as far as we're going.
[02:53:48.220 --> 02:53:52.220]  I mean, just like what do you guys do here? Because like you guys do have a visitor center. Is that correct, sir?
[02:53:52.220 --> 02:53:54.220]  We can't get that information out.
[02:53:54.220 --> 02:53:56.220]  You didn't say, sir, to the scum American.
[02:53:56.220 --> 02:53:58.220]  Are we being detained officer? Absolutely not.
[02:53:58.220 --> 02:54:04.220]  They had him locked in. You're not detained. You can't leave. Give me your ID.
[02:54:04.220 --> 02:54:07.220]  Give me your ID. Enemy American.
[02:54:07.220 --> 02:54:09.220]  Why do I need to give you my ID?
[02:54:09.220 --> 02:54:12.220]  Enemy American. Is you're an enemy American?
[02:54:12.220 --> 02:54:16.220]  Okay, what is it that you want to know? Because you understand this is restricted government property in this area?
[02:54:16.220 --> 02:54:22.220]  Well, sir, I got said there's a sign right here that states no electrical equipment, no video camera, no filming.
[02:54:22.220 --> 02:54:24.220]  Okay, sir, we'll be happy to leave.
[02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:26.220]  Let's stop right there. Can you confirm?
[02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:31.220]  You watch the whole video online. I'm out of time here on that, but listen, here's the deal.
[02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:37.220]  They got a tiny sign saying you can't film. Maybe they got a sign saying I got to come mow their lawn on Saturday mornings.
[02:54:37.220 --> 02:54:40.220]  Maybe they got a sign saying they can have sex with my wife.
[02:54:40.220 --> 02:54:43.220]  Maybe they got a sign saying I got to stick my hand in a meat grinder.
[02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:49.220]  Maybe they got a sign, you don't have Jack Crap. You worked for foreign banks that took over the stage 9-11 and run Al-Qaeda.
[02:54:49.220 --> 02:54:56.220]  I've had enough of it. Anyways, they give them the little, oh, here's an article about you losing a lawsuit over this.
[02:54:56.220 --> 02:54:58.220]  But again, we've got to exercise our rights or lose it.
[02:54:58.220 --> 02:55:03.220]  The whole video is like five more minutes of it up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com for everybody.
[02:55:03.220 --> 02:55:06.220]  That's the type of stuff that's on InfoWars Nightly News every night.
[02:55:06.220 --> 02:55:09.220]  So much of it. We don't have time for here on the radio.
[02:55:09.220 --> 02:55:13.220]  You've got to become subscribers and support us because it's amazing, 7 o'clock central every night.
[02:55:13.220 --> 02:55:16.220]  By the way, huge breaking news at infowars.com.
[02:55:16.220 --> 02:55:21.220]  We confirm this. Talk to the ATF today. The recording is going up there now. We have all the documents.
[02:55:21.220 --> 02:55:27.220]  ATF is racially profiling Hispanic gun owners. This is breaking now.
[02:55:27.220 --> 02:55:32.220]  I was buying guns a few weeks ago and it said, are you Hispanic or Latino?
[02:55:32.220 --> 02:55:36.220]  And I said, what's that mean? They go, we don't know. It's separate from the other race questions.
[02:55:36.220 --> 02:55:44.220]  They want to know. And it's because they run you through the ATF admitted a database of Mexican cartel.
[02:55:44.220 --> 02:55:47.220]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, the country is 37% Hispanic.
[02:55:47.220 --> 02:55:54.220]  You've got in children, it's about 50% and adults 16.3. But overall, it's about 37%.
[02:55:54.220 --> 02:56:02.220]  And I mean, the idea is all Hispanics are criminals because Mexico has a drug war in it and our government ships guns in.
[02:56:02.220 --> 02:56:10.220]  It's incredible article. ATF racially profiling Hispanic gun owners that just went up minutes ago at infowars.com
[02:56:10.220 --> 02:56:14.220]  and investigated a report by Adon Salazar and Matt T. Williams and myself.
[02:56:14.220 --> 02:56:19.220]  So that's up there with all the documents. The audio or the interview with the ATF spokesperson is going to be added as well.
[02:56:19.220 --> 02:56:23.220]  We recorded the phone call. That's being processed and transferred over right now.
[02:56:23.220 --> 02:56:27.220]  It's all up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. We'll cover more on the news tonight.
[02:56:27.220 --> 02:56:34.220]  But here's Jacari Jackson's report on another movie about dystopic future.
[02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:39.220]  Everybody ready for this forever? Here's the Judge Dredd review by our own Jacari Jackson.
[02:56:39.220 --> 02:56:48.220]  And then we will continue here on air with the retransmission.
[02:56:48.220 --> 02:56:59.220]  Judge Joseph Dredd has come to the screens once again. This time the adaptation simply titled Dredd.
[02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:06.220]  I'm Jacari Jackson for the Infowars Nightly News. Let's analyze this trailer to find the fact behind the fiction of this new film.
[02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:16.220]  Spoiler alert.
[02:57:16.220 --> 02:57:21.220]  The Judge Dredd storyline takes place in 2070 after war has devastated the majority of the United States,
[02:57:21.220 --> 02:57:30.220]  leaving only a few large sections of land known as megacities inhabitable.
[02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:34.220]  Megacities are full of cramped skyscrapers that house the city's population.
[02:57:34.220 --> 02:57:40.220]  Agenda 21 highlights include the destruction of the family unit in the name of sustainable development,
[02:57:40.220 --> 02:57:45.220]  with people being forced to live in tight compact cities and high-rise stackem and packham apartments
[02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:48.220]  no bigger than this 16 by 16 foot space.
[02:57:48.220 --> 02:58:00.220]  See any similarities?
[02:58:00.220 --> 02:58:06.220]  There we saw drones patrolling the city skies. Now this is probably the least futuristic aspect of the entire trailer,
[02:58:06.220 --> 02:58:10.220]  mainly because there are drones patrolling the US skies right now.
[02:58:10.220 --> 02:58:14.220]  It wasn't long ago that it was said that drones in the US would be unarmed,
