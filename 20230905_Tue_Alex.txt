[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]  Glad I live in a country made of laws.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.800]  As Chris Gleason, reporting for the Gateway Pundit, reported, a bombshell investigation
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.180]  has uncovered jaw-dropping connections between Fannie Willis and a sprawling web of election
[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.140]  fraud and money laundering activities.
[00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.000]  You know, she's raised 92% of her funding out of 44 states outside of Georgia, and
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.200]  only 8% came out of that local area, so that tells you what's going on.
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.840]  The investigation, which spans across multiple states and multiple jurisdictions, has revealed
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.320]  a complex network of illicit operations aimed at undermining the very foundation of
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.520]  our constitutional republic and the rule of law.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.640]  The first local elected official identified as part of this ongoing money laundering
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.320]  operation was New York DA Alvin Bragg.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.760]  We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.540]  Exposed by James O'Keefe and his people at O'Keefe Media Group, Alvin Bragg received
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.920]  massive numbers of campaign finance contributions from this network of individuals who had
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.960]  been identified as Smurfs.
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.880]  FEC data shows that some senior citizens across the U.S. have been donating thousands
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.240]  of times per year.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:46.880]  The investigation into Alvin Bragg also helped to uncover the use of prepaid credit
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.440]  and debit cards in the structuring of the campaign finance contributions and the payment
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.240]  to ballot-harvesting mules.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.940]  Illicit campaign finance funds were also identified in the campaigns of the Wisconsin
[00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.580]  Supreme Court race of Janet Protasiewicz and Senator Ralph Warnock, and spread to
[00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.120]  states such as Missouri, Maryland, Wisconsin, Arizona, and then into every single state
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.480]  in the United States.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:21.080]  We have videotape of Jackie Amos going into boxes, bringing in thumb drives, bringing
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.520]  in ballots to be inserted into machines.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.880]  This is the opportunity to stop corruption and to stop fraud when it comes to elections
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.320]  in the state of Mississippi.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.840]  This is what Fannie Willis and the Democrats have created in Atlanta.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.320]  Boarded up in abandoned homes everywhere.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.480]  Crack houses for blocks and blocks.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.160]  Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, another inmate died in custody.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.360]  Five inmates in the last month, all black.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360]  Why?
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.720]  Let me see here.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.040]  You got a black mayor, you got a black prosecutor, you got a black sheriff, and black
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.600]  people are dying at the jail.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]  Where's Al Sharpton?
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.200]  Where's Kamala Harris?
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680]  Where's Joe Biden?
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680]  Nowhere to be found.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.880]  Where's Black Lives Matter?
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.000]  My father is a former, and I guess always, a black panther.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.320]  I take a lot of pride in being black in America.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.480]  Do you think that you were personally singled out by Fannie Willis and others to set
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.480]  an example?
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.480]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.360]  She wanted to send a message to black folks.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.500]  You know, there's a huge trend amongst African American men leaning towards President
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.080]  Trump and looking more into conservatism, and you know, they definitely don't want
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]  that.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.800]  Some say he's racist and tweets like a kid, while overlooking all the good shit
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.800]  that he did.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.800]  I ain't ashamed of my president a little bit.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.560]  I'd rather have an alpha male than a little bitch.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.920]  It was recently discovered that 222 contributions to Atlanta DA Fannie Willis' campaign had zero
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.320]  donor information, while one of the out-of-state Fannie Willis campaign contributors had made
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.480]  over 9,178 individual contributions just at the federal level since 2018.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.400]  Meanwhile, this nationwide money laundering Rico enterprise is making more and more contributions
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.740]  to PACs, and these PACs in turn are financing local candidates.
[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.560]  This Rico operation is at the heart of the Democrat Party's ability to retain power,
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.440]  a full-fledged organized crime operation with strong ties to a myriad of Soros-connected
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.640]  organizations, operating within a one-world government agenda framework to destroy the
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.120]  United States.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:57.100]  Now delivered on a silver platter to an unwilling Congress ushering in its own demise, John
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.920]  Bowne reporting.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.480]  It's just a mask.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.320]  It's just six feet.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.860]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.280]  It's just non-essential workers.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.840]  It's just until we work it out.
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.360]  It's just a bar.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.520]  It's just a restaurant.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.440]  It's just nursing homes.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.280]  It's just schools.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.600]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.180]  It's just until the cases go down.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.440]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.240]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.680]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.280]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.760]  It's just churches and mosques.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.460]  It's just singing.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.120]  It's just travel.
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.560]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.560]  It's just for the greater good.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.320]  It's just fact-checking, not censorship.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.320]  It's just mandatory.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.200]  It isn't just at all.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.680]  Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.640]  And it's time for you to stand up in the info war
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.080]  and say, I don't know what's going
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.600]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight,
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.720]  you better believe you've got one.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.400]  From the front lines of the information war,
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.800]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.480]  All right, this weekend, a lot of big developments happened,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.600]  as you obviously know.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.400]  A long weekend.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.800]  And we're going to be here laying it all out today
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.600]  on this Tuesday, September 5, 2023.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.560]  Must watch transmission.
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.600]  One of the best political analysts out there,
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.640]  former Naval Intelligence Officer, Jack Posobick,
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.160]  is going to be able to spend a whole hour with us coming up
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.880]  in about 25 minutes from now to cover the waterfront.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.720]  The Ukrainians have now, admittedly,
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.720]  completely collapsed on the battlefield,
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.240]  despite all the NATO forces and weapons.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.880]  And so they've fired most of the command of the Ukrainians.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.920]  Zelensky has.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.120]  That means NATO has.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.360]  And things are deteriorating very, very quickly.
[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.760]  And we're also seeing a lot of the soldiers coming back
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.880]  to the United States, who were
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.240]  sheep-dipped into the Ukrainian forces by the CIA.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.000]  And I would look for some of those groups
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.580]  to be some of the organizations that
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.960]  are going to stage some of the false flags here in America.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.320]  We know that they were heavily involved.
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.400]  Some of the Azov people at the US Capitol
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.800]  on January 6 in Charlottesville.
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.100]  So they're using them as cutouts,
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.780]  kind of like they use the Cubans from the Bay of Pigs
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:20.580]  that survived to be part of the Kennedy assassination.
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.900]  So it's a rerun of all of that.
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.180]  Very, very dangerous time.
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.100]  But I would look for some of these Ukrainian forces
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.620]  to launch terror attacks inside the United States
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.260]  to be blamed on Biden's opposition that
[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.020]  follows historic parallels.
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.940]  And we also have the different synthetic Nazi organizations
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.140]  now popping up everywhere across the United States
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.500]  ahead of, I believe, false flag terror attacks
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.660]  to be blamed on Trump supporters.
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.780]  That's what the pre-programming of the narrative is.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:54.100]  We'll be looking at that in depth.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.440]  And Elon Musk has come out and said what I told you years ago.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:05.660]  The ADL is a multinational Mossad, CIA, MI6 group
[00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.780]  that has private intelligence officers in most
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.740]  your police departments, even in small towns.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.340]  They put in a lot of the judges.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.780]  And their job is converting America
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.620]  into an absolute tyranny.
[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.440]  They're heavily involved in the new UN treaty
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.460]  that ends free speech as we know it.
[00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.460]  I have a giant stack.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.260]  I've been promising a deep dive on that.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.860]  But it's really ripe in the last few days.
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.120]  Elon Musk came out and said, it looks like we have no
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.420]  choice but to file a defamation lawsuit
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.580]  against the India Defamation League.
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.180]  They discovered internally that the ADL was basically
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.700]  running Twitter as a go-between for the FBI and CIA.
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.460]  Musk has promised to release those documents next week.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.300]  A lot of them have already come out in Congress.
[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.420]  This is totally illegal.
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.380]  It also came out in mainstream news this weekend
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.620]  like it was no big deal that the ADL has AI chatbot systems
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.860]  installed under agreements with many of the telecommunications
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.500]  companies right down to some of the top online video
[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.620]  consoles, video game consoles, and is recording everything
[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.620]  you see in your house and transcribing it.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:14.460]  So that broke, can't make that up.
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.300]  That is just the unbelievable magnitude of this.
[00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.220]  So while you're playing Call of Duty or World of Warcraft,
[00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.140]  it's listening to everything you're saying
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.640]  and creating a file on you.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.100]  Now we know a lot of other companies are doing this
[00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.300]  as well but the ADL is the first to come out
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:39.460]  and admit they're doing it and say they're proud of it.
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.620]  So the Alexa in your house is listening to you,
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.780]  the Google assistants are, and it turns out the ADL
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.820]  basically programs it and controls it.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.980]  So that's why I say it's the most Nazi thing
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.220]  I've ever seen.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:57.540]  The Nazi surveilled people, censored people,
[00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:02.300]  boycotted people, put the Jews and other people
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.420]  in ghettos, wouldn't let them have businesses.
[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.900]  They de-bank the Jews and I didn't do anything
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.140]  to the Jews or the ADL and I don't deserve
[00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.500]  to be treated like I'm a Jew in Nazi Germany.
[00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.620]  And so when people finally take the blinders off
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:20.020]  and see this, this is just insane.
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.820]  But again, it's a globalist crime syndicate,
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.060]  it's a mafia that simply hides the entire New World
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:29.460]  or takeover behind a civil rights organization.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.220]  I mean the crimes they're committing, folks,
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.820]  I mean I gotta say the chutzpah here is pretty spectacular.
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.020]  But again, it came out in the 70s and 80s,
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.580]  the ADL got caught all over the country
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.780]  posing as white supremacist groups
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.140]  and it came out in their own documents
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.020]  from lawsuits and criminal charges against the ADL
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.260]  and I've got some of those articles here to review later
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.260]  that the main Nazi leaders were mainly Jewish.
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.500]  And of course it's the same today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:04.260]  It's LARPing, it's live action role playing
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.660]  and then they'll also get some mentally ill
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.780]  white prison gang folks to be on the payroll
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.340]  who are dumber than a box of rocks
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.980]  and they'll run around highling Hitler everywhere.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.420]  But it comes out in every case later
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.140]  that it's either Southern Poverty Law Center,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.020]  let's not just blame the ADL,
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:25.700]  the ADL or the FBI and direct control or the CIA.
[00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.020]  So I thought we'd review some of that
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:28.340]  after Jack Posobick leaves us
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.100]  in about an hour and a half from now.
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.260]  It's a very large stack.
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.140]  And guys, the ADL came out last week
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.140]  and announced how proud they were
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.340]  of all of this.
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.180]  So we're going to be going over
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.580]  some of those video clips and more.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.100]  And I've also dredged up some newscasts
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.580]  and things from the 80s and 90s
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.940]  where the ADL got caught
[00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:51.100]  commanding the white supremacist organizations.
[00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.100]  And of course, Oklahoma City was run
[00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.300]  by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.980]  That came out in federal court
[00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.900]  under sworn testimony by US informants and federal agents.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:01.860]  They were commanding
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.660]  the Elohim City white supremacist compound
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.580]  where they then of course helped McVeigh
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.700]  cook up the diversionary truck bomb with Larry Nichols.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.700]  So very dangerous people, very dangerous.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.580]  And so people need to be aware of that
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.180]  and understand that.
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.740]  But that's why they had German intelligence
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.620]  involved with them as well.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.060]  It's been even the one in Guardian
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.500]  that most of the white supremacist groups in Germany
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.300]  it turned out are led by the German government.
[00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.020]  So this is how they divide and conquer us.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.860]  And it's truly disgusting.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.220]  And Elon Musk has come out.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.420]  I've got his tweets right here.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.620]  And he said, look, we got the documents.
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.740]  They were already running Twitter
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.980]  and all the other big tech companies before it.
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.060]  And they told us to do whatever they say politically
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.620]  and basically let them run the company still
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.640]  or they would destroy us.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.220]  And now they've got all the documents
[00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.860]  that they've lost more than half their sponsors
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.660]  at Twitter in the Western world.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.900]  The Asians, Musk said, aren't intimidated.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.180]  They don't even listen to it.
[00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.060]  If they advertise something and it sells there,
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.020]  they just advertise there.
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.060]  But with US audiences and US companies, European companies,
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.280]  they don't want the ADL coming after them.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.460]  So the ADL calls up and says,
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.960]  hey, you're advertising with Elon Musk.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.020]  He's a white supremacist or whatever.
[00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.100]  And the truth is, is that they were censoring
[00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.940]  hundreds of millions of people on Twitter,
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:23.780]  same thing on Google and Facebook,
[00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.220]  billions of posts about COVID.
[00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.100]  And the ADL has now been caught
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.500]  along with the feds and the CIA
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.380]  and the congressional hearings,
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.580]  targeting people to be shadow bans.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.860]  You don't know you've been banned, but you have been.
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.380]  If you think the Afghan withdrawal was bad,
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.780]  or if you don't want new lockdowns,
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.580]  or you don't open borders,
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.680]  or you criticize Joe Biden vacationing too much,
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.780]  the ADL has AI algorithms that flag you
[00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.380]  and then no one can see you.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.700]  And then they'll go further and just have you deleted.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.600]  So you talk about racketeering.
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.300]  You talk about criminal activity.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.400]  You talk about an intelligence operation,
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.820]  but you notice that even the congressional hearings
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.620]  in the last few months about all this,
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.940]  they show the justice department, CIA documents,
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.120]  and they show different leftist organizations interfacing,
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.360]  but very little about the ADL.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.060]  And you know, Tucker, who I love to death,
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.380]  came out and did an interview with Megyn Kelly.
[00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.480]  And he said, well, we'll play the clip later,
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.500]  but he said, oh, it's such a wonderful organization.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.940]  It's such a great mission, the ADL.
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.220]  Now it's run by a guy that,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.940]  basically just a Democratic Party operative
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.860]  and wants to silence their opposition.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:38.060]  Sorry, the ADL's never been good, okay?
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.740]  The ADL is a protection racket,
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.540]  and it's been exposed by other Jewish groups
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.340]  that we'll play clips of later.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.460]  They want anti-Semitism and persecution of Jews, duh,
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.260]  because then they get more money.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.700]  So they're creating a dialectic,
[00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.940]  and they're working for some very evil groups.
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.980]  So if you love Hitler, you love the ADL.
[00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.420]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really,
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.380]  really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.220]  really, really good news,
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:06.820]  because it's a great product you love,
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.380]  and people want it, and it funds our Operation 360 win.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.740]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula,
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.820]  the strongest you're going to find anywhere,
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.060]  jam-packed, a big old giant bottle of stuff
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.620]  that destroys inflammation,
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.260]  that empowers your neurological system, you name it.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.260]  I mean, it's just so amazing.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.500]  God gave it to us,
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.700]  and it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.140]  Other leading brands are like 70% curcuminoid.
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.500]  Most brands are 5% curcumin,
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.820]  and that still does a great thing for you.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:40.700]  This is the strongest anybody makes, 95% curcuminoid.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.260]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.180]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.060]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.

[00:17:12.649 --> 00:17:18.570]  ban it. And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.

[00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:07.710]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:22.240]  Again, Jack Mesovic coming up next segment. You know, Jack is very, very popular on TV
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:29.280]  and very, very popular on Twitter, and I think he's underrated, and he's not really underrated.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.720]  I'm not saying he's underrated. I'm saying he should be rated even better because he's
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.400]  one of the smartest people when it comes to really piercing through the propaganda and
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.320]  the noise and cutting right to the signal, so I really look forward to him joining us
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:47.040]  for a full hour. We're going to cover so many critical subjects with him, and I remember
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:54.360]  when he tried to come to work here like five years ago, and I just said, no, Jack,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:58.500]  you're going to be more successful not working here because I knew that we were under such
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:05.120]  incredible attack and that he was so smart that that would have damaged him, and that's
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.480]  how I think, big picture, now we've gotten back up on our feet. We're going to be working
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:12.400]  with a lot of people and trying to actually expand things, but I can see the trajectory
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.620]  we're going through at that time that I was about to be put through a meat grinder
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.440]  and anybody close to me would be hurt by it, and that's really a great satisfaction
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.760]  I have now is to see not just people that are already awake like Jack Mesovic being
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.480]  so huge now, and he's been big forever ever since he showed up on the political
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.160]  scene and has been an advisor to Trump, you name it, but to now see Tucker Carlson
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:40.800]  fully awake and so many others, again, that's a real bellwether to let everybody know just
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.400]  how close we are to beating this thing, but that means the globalists are going to throw
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:52.100]  the kitchen sink at us, and that means false flags, attempts at race war, new viral
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.440]  releases and so much more. So I came across some research yesterday and went down a rabbit
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:06.800]  hole and have done about probably six hours of research on Saturday afternoon when I discovered
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:14.400]  a little clip on Twitter that I'm going to play when Jack joins us, and we'll talk
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.640]  some about this subject with him because he's one of the few people out there that
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:23.120]  can really add a lot to the big picture because not a lot of people know about this.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:26.720]  I talked to him this morning and I said, would you like to talk about this? What's
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.000]  your view on this? Just send him a clip. Boom, boom, boom, boom. All this cutting
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.640]  edge angles that I'd thought of and hadn't thought of that just totally clicked. So
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.320]  we're going into race specific bio weapons, including down to the individual and head
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:51.840]  DARPA leaders and heads of neuroscience divisions of major universities giving presentations
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:23:01.400]  on soon nanotech prions will be released that look like hemorrhagic fever that'll
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:09.800]  cause massive blood clots, heart attacks and strokes. And these are clips from 2017
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:16.820]  at the Pentagon. I got a bunch of them right here from just one hour long lecture
[00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:24.020]  that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. And that's the thing. I don't
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.900]  care if you are black. I don't care if you're a Muslim, white, Christian, Jewish. I love
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:36.620]  everybody as an individual. And that's why I really grieve that we have organizations
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:43.420]  like the ADL that knowingly are creating division and are knowingly breaking down society.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.980]  And when I refreshed my research last week as the ADL thing came to the surface like
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.860]  a cold sore, people want me to cover it. So we are covering it forever. We've been
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:57.140]  persecuted by it forever. I've been persecuted by the ADL for at least 25 years viciously.
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:04.860]  And I started reviewing what they put out in colleges and in public schools, even
[00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:12.540]  down to elementary schools. And the ADL is the main group that puts out the curriculum
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.700]  that is picked up everywhere, that white people are inherently bad, that Christians are bad
[00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:21.900]  and that, well, there's no whites getting killed in South Africa. And just all of it.
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:27.700]  It's just so nasty. A group operating on racial division, a group wanting tyranny,
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:32.260]  a group wanting censorship, a group spying on you. When I said it's the most Hitler-like
[00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.180]  thing I've ever seen in the West, I'm not saying they actually hail Hitler like Hitler.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:47.300]  I'm saying that they act the same and are just horrible, horrible organization.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.340]  And it's refreshing to see people stand up to it and say, you know,
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:56.139]  we're sick of being called things we're not. I mean, Hitler was a loser.
[00:24:56.139 --> 00:25:04.139]  Both my grandfathers dropped bombs on Germany and I'm sad for the Germans that got killed.
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:11.780]  It was terrible for everybody. But I mean, just I don't deserve to sit here as an American
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:17.300]  and have the ADL swing 80-year-old hatred of the Nazis from World War II that happened
[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:23.500]  80 years ago onto us. And that's my identity. And then you can't shake a stick at the
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:30.580]  people around the ADL who aren't actually servants of Hitler. Soros, of course, but
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.139]  and that's the thing that real Jewish organizations have exposed.
[00:25:34.139 --> 00:25:37.820]  I covered this decades ago. We need to bring it back up in the history of it.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:41.620]  Did you know there were rich, powerful Jews like Madeleine Albright's father?
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:47.220]  It wasn't even national news about this a decade ago. She was on 60 Minutes
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.500]  and people saw all this famous art that was from famous Jews killed in the death
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:59.260]  camps that her father stole from them. Because there was a whole enterprise of rich
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:05.180]  Jews. Soros down at the bottom, he was a bloodhound, would go find Jews up to the top
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:11.940]  like Madeleine Albright's father. So, I mean, it's just like you've got Nazi,
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:17.620]  you've got stolen art from murdered Jews on your wall, but it's okay because you're Jewish.
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.620]  No, it's not. Or you're Madeleine Albright says, yeah, we killed 500,000 Iraqi kids.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:27.700]  I tripled the sanctions. I'd do it again. And say, oh, oh, you're a Jewish woman.
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.540]  So you're allowed to brag about killing 500,000 kids. I don't care if you're Jewish,
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.780]  German, Chinese, man. You do crap like that, you're evil.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:46.260]  So the arrogance is disgusting. And the truth is the ADL was not founded
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:52.500]  out of Nazi collaborators. It was founded in a disputed case of a girl that was killed
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.620]  in a factory. And they said by the Jewish owner, and then he got lynched.
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.460]  Whatever the truth of that case was, that's how it got founded.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:06.139]  And then after World War II, all these rich Jews that had made a deal with
[00:27:06.139 --> 00:27:09.980]  Hitler to send the Jews to Palestine that never got fully implemented, I mean,
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:15.740]  that was all agreed on. And there were all these powerful Jews there
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.460]  robbing the Jews of their money to try to get out of Germany and Europe.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:29.020]  And the ADL is a representation of those people. They prey on Jews by listing all
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:34.180]  this tyranny as run by a Jewish organization and the censorship and surveillance,
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.540]  and that white people are inherently bad, and that Catholic conservatives are
[00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:40.780]  bad people. And then there's all these conservatives, Christians in America,
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.620]  that have been very pro-Jew, very pro-Israel. I was brought up very
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.220]  pro-Israel. I still don't hate Israel, but I don't lionize it and think
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.139]  it's perfect. It's like our government's out of control, too.
[00:27:50.139 --> 00:27:54.940]  But it's very offensive to grow up hating Nazis and to grow up both your grandfathers
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.780]  in the Army Air Corps and all the rest of it, and to then think of yourself
[00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:03.700]  as like Captain America, and then have some group lie about you and be mean to you
[00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.380]  and persecute you. And Sacha Baron Cohen gets up and says,
[00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.540]  we're going to put Mark Zuckerberg in prison if he doesn't do what we say,
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:13.900]  and we're going to put Alex Jones in prison? And they're all clapping about it?
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.620]  You want to hurt me. You're hurting me. I didn't do anything to you.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:21.340]  I know you know that. You don't care. You're cold-blooded.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:25.020]  But there are a lot of good Jews and other people that need to understand how
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:29.820]  the ADL's setting you up. The ADL is very sophisticated,
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.820]  Hegelian dialectic, and there is massive reassurance of anti-Semitism
[00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.100]  because of the ADL. They're the ones driving the whole thing.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.740]  Now you see how powerful they're going to get out of that.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.940]  Hell, if there was a new Nazi takeover of America, I bet you money the ADL would round
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.420]  up the Jews, help the Germans, help whoever, and then take the money from them,
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.620]  and then the ADL would run off with the cash.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.020]  That's the type of people who run the ADL. You understand that?
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.020]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.420]  I didn't realize this was back this week. I thought it was next week.
[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.820]  I come in this morning. It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.420]  Body's ultimate memory formula. And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:17.940]  Overhead shot, please. Look how full this model is.
[00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:26.740]  Right to the top, folks. Right to the top with these 95% curcumin oil.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.020]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10%.
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:37.420]  The other strongest brands are 75%. This is 95%.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.100]  Super constant. It's like taking one pill. It's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.100]  It's that powerful. Or more.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:48.100]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.100]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.100]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:07.100]  coffee has not been available, and that's because the prices went up too high for
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.780]  the raw beans, and the quality had gone down some.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.780]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:17.780]  But now, we have brought back the coffee, and it's even better from a

[00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:35.030]  Well, you can find his daily shows that are very successful and popular and informative
[00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.030]  at humanevents.com.
[00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:39.430]  And of course you can find him where he dominates Twitter.
[00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:43.310]  Jack Posobick joins us for a full hour.
[00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:47.030]  Very appreciative of that because he's one of the smartest people I know when it comes
[00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:52.150]  to geopolitical systems and he has a wide knowledge of a lot of different areas and
[00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.510]  few people have that.
[00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:57.510]  So Jack, your research is always invaluable.
[00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.750]  I'm a daily viewer, great to have you here with us.
[00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.750]  It's also been great to be on your show as well.
[00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.150]  I talked to you during the break, I said, what's front and center?
[00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.510]  We talked a lot this morning about different topics, Grant.
[00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:14.750]  You said obviously the, in your words, complete collapse of the, well, I said of the Ukrainian
[00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:15.750]  military.
[00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.670]  You said, well, it's a complete collapse of their system, period.
[00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:23.830]  We've had the Democrats obviously try to deny that there's any corruption going on,
[00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.150]  but they're heavily involved, ended up with their eyeballs.
[00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:30.270]  Now it's coming out in the mainstream news, the New York Times, so a major, major shift
[00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.270]  here.
[00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:33.950]  I'd like you to give us your analysis on that and what you think is coming next.
[00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:38.590]  Then we'll look at the massive censorship wars and, and the ADL and this big fight
[00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:42.830]  with Elon Musk and the weaponization committee hearings that we've seen.
[00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.630]  And then of course we're going to get into the latest on the Georgia Secretary of State
[00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.990]  testimony blows up in Fannie Willis's case, turns out it was all lies.
[00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:53.710]  What Trump said was true there.
[00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:58.950]  We're going to cover the waterfront literally here with Jack Posoback today.
[00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.950]  So thanks Jack.
[00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.990]  Well, it's always a pleasure to be on.
[00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.230]  And Tanya asked me to say that we and the family are praying for you.
[00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.830]  We're praying for your family.
[00:35:08.830 --> 00:35:09.830]  We're supporting you.
[00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.430]  We're hoping that God is with you and on your side as you continue your fight to
[00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:19.310]  bring the truth, to bring freedom and to liberate the minds of the American people
[00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.250]  and really people across the world.
[00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:24.430]  She asked me to say that to you when I was coming on today, so I wanted to put
[00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:25.430]  that out there.
[00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.770]  Look, you know, and Alex, you and I sat next to each other at the Twitter hearing when
[00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:37.010]  Jack Dorsey came in five years ago now to Capitol Hill, Washington, DC, and he claimed
[00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:38.570]  there'd be no censorship, nothing.
[00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:43.130]  But then you go and look at what has happened to Twitter X now that, uh, now that
[00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:47.970]  Elon has taken it over and it directly ties back to what we see going on in Ukraine
[00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:48.970]  on the battlefield.
[00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:53.330]  Now, all of this is inextricably linked and I can explain.
[00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:58.770]  So one of the ways that Twitter under the old regime was conducting censorship is they
[00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:03.490]  had all of these partners on their essentially censorship council, which they called the
[00:36:03.490 --> 00:36:05.070]  trust and safety commission.
[00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:09.910]  So on trust and safety, you would have people at one point that were actually from
[00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:10.910]  the FBI.
[00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:16.210]  So you had actual FBI agents that were coming to Twitter from intelligence and law
[00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.690]  enforcement sources in Ukraine.
[00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.770]  And then who are they targeting?
[00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:21.330]  They were targeting journalists.
[00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:22.650]  They were targeting activists.
[00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:27.810]  They were targeting just random accounts, random people on Twitter and claiming if you spoke
[00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:31.250]  out against what was happening in Ukraine, if you said, Oh, you got the photo of us.
[00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:37.930]  If you spoke out about what was going on on the ground, if you, that was just different
[00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.450]  from the mainstream media narrative, whether it's New York times, whether it's CNN, et
[00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.450]  cetera.
[00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:43.770]  Remember at the time they told us it was all together.
[00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.250]  Oh, they said, uh, you know, Ukraine's going to be in the middle of this counter
[00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:48.250]  offensive.
[00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.090]  They're going to be taken, uh, Mariupol back.
[00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:51.090]  They're going to be taken political.
[00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.930]  They're going to be punching through the Ukraine, the, uh, the Russian land bridge all
[00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:54.930]  the way down.
[00:36:55.050 --> 00:37:00.930]  of Crimea is at hand when the actual truth of the matter is that it's been a complete
[00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:01.930]  opposite.
[00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:08.130]  NATO has been dealt a crushing blow on the banks of this counter offensive.
[00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.650]  Uh, they attempted to use these blitzkrieg style tactics.
[00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.730]  They've been a complete failure on the battlefield because why?
[00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.850]  Well, the Russians know how to fight against blitzkrieg.
[00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:19.210]  It did the entire thing in world war II.
[00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:22.690]  Maybe some people could look it up because I guarantee you the Russian generals definitely
[00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:26.370]  when they go through their military academy, they study the battles of world war II where
[00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:30.330]  they defeated the Wehrmacht on this, by the way, on the very same terrain where they're
[00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.490]  fighting right now in the Donbas.
[00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:36.930]  And so the fact that NATO has seen this huge collapse of their forces on the backs
[00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:42.070]  of the Ukrainian people has left a lot of people even inside Ukraine looking around
[00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:45.130]  pointing fingers saying, so Linsky, where are the heads going to roll?
[00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.330]  This is why we've seen Alex just in the last week.
[00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:54.710]  Ukraine has arrested, arrested the main oligarch Igor Kolomoisky who was completely
[00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:59.490]  behind the rise of Zelensky to begin with all the way back in 2019 when he ran for
[00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:03.850]  office, even before then when he had his TV show, same exact oligarch, Igor Kolomoisky
[00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.970]  was funding Zelensky's TV show.
[00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:12.170]  He then funded his, uh, his party, this, this, um, uh, this party that he set up
[00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:17.050]  to run with all the way back in 2019 when he decided that he's not going to be a TV
[00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:18.050]  star anymore.
[00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:22.730]  Now he's going to be a political, uh, political force makes up a new party.
[00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:28.730]  The very oligarch Igor Kolomoisky has just been arrested in Ukraine over corruption
[00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:29.730]  charges.
[00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:30.730]  Then what do we find out today?
[00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:34.650]  The Ukrainian minister of defense has just been fired.
[00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:38.050]  And he was the same guy that just four months ago said, oh, we're not just going
[00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.890]  to push the Russians out in one month.
[00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.370]  We're going to invade and roll into Moscow.
[00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.010]  Just delusional statements.
[00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.410]  No, all the way into Moscow.
[00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:48.410]  Everything's coming apart.
[00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:49.610]  Send us another a hundred billion.
[00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:50.610]  Everything will be great.
[00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:55.450]  Well, it turns out that guy comes out and, and, and Alex, it's amazing how suddenly
[00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:59.410]  when the minute that somebody falls out of favor, the minute that somebody has a
[00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.290]  little bit of problems on the battlefield, a lot of when somebody becomes a little
[00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.970]  bit expendable, then they suddenly discovered that this person's been corrupt all
[00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:06.970]  the time.
[00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:11.730]  So now even the Ukrainians are admitting that this guy was essentially siphoning off money
[00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.130]  that the United States and NATO were sending to you.
[00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.450]  And that was my next question.
[00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:16.450]  How big is it?
[00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:17.450]  It ain't just him.
[00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.450]  It's all of them.
[00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:24.290]  So what does it signify now from your research and your great sources that the New York
[00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:29.050]  Times and the Biden regime is turning on Zelensky, Zelensky's sacking all these
[00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:32.950]  different chiefs, having a major reorganization.
[00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.710]  Does that signify that NATO is going to escalate support and they're trying to just
[00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.770]  get people in that they think will follow their orders or does it signify they're
[00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.930]  going to start backing up and then maybe make a peace deal with Putin?
[00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:47.529]  Well, Alex, NATO is going to continue and John Mearsheimer, the great professor Mearsheimer
[00:39:47.529 --> 00:39:50.170]  is just published in a very lengthy essay.
[00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.570]  I read it last night on his sub stack where he states, it's very simple what's
[00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:56.290]  going on.
[00:39:56.290 --> 00:40:02.730]  Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian men, Ukrainian blood is being sacrificed so that NATO can
[00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.770]  take out Russian soldiers.
[00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:06.130]  This isn't about Ukraine.
[00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:08.170]  It's not about liberating the people of Ukraine.
[00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.890]  They don't care about the women and children.
[00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:11.890]  They don't care about the children being trafficked.
[00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.370]  They're being caught up on the borders and they've arrested people for this.
[00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:15.770]  The organs being trafficked out of there.
[00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:19.010]  They don't care about that because it's about degrading Russia.
[00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:25.370]  It is a proxy war on Russia being fought with the military blood of Ukraine.
[00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:32.090]  Therefore, they will continue escalating in Ukraine until they don't think that they're
[00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:37.090]  basically killing enough Russians, which is something that you've heard even high-level
[00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.090]  members of the United States government.
[00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:44.650]  The Secretary of Defense said, so did Milly, they said, oh, this is just a degrade Russia.
[00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:46.730]  So this isn't going for many years.
[00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:47.730]  Right.
[00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:52.730]  So we need to understand that when we talk about the thousands of deaths of Ukrainians
[00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:56.410]  in the counter offensive, when they talk about potentially 400,000 heroes, right?
[00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:57.410]  That's the Ukrainian.
[00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.650]  One Ukrainian broadcaster recently slipped up and said, oh, we have 400,000 heroes since
[00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:02.650]  the beginning of Ukraine.
[00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:03.650]  400,000 deaths?
[00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.490]  Is that what they're talking about?
[00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.330]  Almost a half a million people.
[00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:13.010]  We're talking World War One scale numbers going into World War Two scale numbers.
[00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.770]  This is stuff that the United States has never seen.
[00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:20.930]  But of course, we are the ones pushing it because the elites continue to succeed off
[00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:21.930]  of it.
[00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.170]  They continue to benefit and gain off of it.
[00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.529]  That's why you're going to see, Alex, I actually predict that you're going to see
[00:41:27.529 --> 00:41:32.290]  now more direct NATO control of the Ukrainian government, more direct NATO control of
[00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.210]  the Ukrainian military, more CIA involvement.
[00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:40.330]  And yes, we are going to see more escalation, perhaps even escalation to the point of attacks
[00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:44.890]  like we saw the Nord Stream two bombing that bridge that connects Crimea to the to
[00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:45.890]  the rest of Russia.
[00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:50.730]  I predict that bridge will be attacked in the next probably two to four months.
[00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:51.730]  I totally agree.
[00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:55.490]  And that's what I see from this is this is not NATO pulling back.
[00:41:55.490 --> 00:42:00.730]  This is NATO reshuffling the card deck here.
[00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:01.730]  Well that's right.
[00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:08.210]  And it's funny you mention that has a story of today about how the FBI created a card
[00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.850]  deck of January six defendants, not even defendants at the time.
[00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.490]  They were just suspects of thirty six hundred cards there.
[00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:20.490]  You are now seeing the takedown of people who had power from the previous regimes in
[00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.490]  Ukraine.
[00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.569]  Anyone who's installed now is going to be a complete puppet.
[00:42:24.569 --> 00:42:29.010]  Anyone who's installed now is going to be someone that's only there at the remit of
[00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:33.890]  people like Victoria Nuland, people like Jake Sullivan, people like Tony Blinken.
[00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:36.250]  These guys are the ones actually running this thing.
[00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.210]  And oh, by the way, they were the very same ones who are running it all the way
[00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.790]  back during the Maidan coup of 2014.
[00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:46.250]  What should Republicans do as the impeachment begins to move forward against Biden?
[00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:51.690]  I think the money and the hundreds of billions and all the corruption should be front and
[00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:52.690]  center.
[00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:55.970]  And I see that as a good way of making the deep state back down, making NATO back
[00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.250]  down and then making a deal with Putin.
[00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:02.090]  Obviously, all he wants is that security zone that he already has.
[00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:06.170]  And then we can move back from the brink here instead of the clear escalation ladder
[00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:12.490]  that we're following up with F-16 pilots being trained with huge munitions factories
[00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:14.529]  being built in Poland.
[00:43:14.529 --> 00:43:15.970]  And they're talking about a 10 year war.
[00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:16.970]  NATO is.
[00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:17.970]  I mean, this is madness.
[00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:21.090]  And the Russians, as you know, are just beginning to scale up.
[00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.130]  So how do we put pressure to end this?
[00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:24.770]  Do you think that will be successful?
[00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:27.370]  And then if we're not successful, how do you see this escalating?
[00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.370]  What's the timeline?
[00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:34.370]  Well, Alex, unfortunately, I think it's I think it's worse than people realize, because
[00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:39.490]  I know you and you've done fantastic reporting on the reintroduction of covid, this push
[00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.650]  to reintroduce covid lockdowns.
[00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:46.130]  Jill Biden coming out today and saying that she has tested positive.
[00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:51.569]  You directly predicted through your TSA whistleblower that mid-September and here we are September
[00:43:51.569 --> 00:43:56.290]  25th that that these introductions would begin to take place.
[00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:03.569]  However, Tucker Carlson also floated a new idea, and that is, could they possibly push
[00:44:03.569 --> 00:44:11.490]  for full scale war with Russia, a hot war with Russia to essentially claim war powers?
[00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:15.450]  And we've already seen the normalization of this in Ukraine, where Ukraine has said
[00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:20.330]  we will not hold elections because we are at wartime.
[00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:25.890]  Is that potentially the setting the stage to normalize the idea of even the United States
[00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:29.450]  not being able to hold elections because we are in a hot war with Russia?
[00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.790]  Alex, the way I'm looking at things, that's exactly the way the dominoes are falling
[00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:34.790]  right now.
[00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:39.210]  They follow as a direct chain between the indictment of Trump, the attempts to remove
[00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:44.890]  Trump from the ballot, going after key Trump lieutenants.
[00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.810]  The trial of Bannon, Peter Navarro goes on trial today.
[00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:51.330]  The impeachment of Ken Paxton down in Texas is going on today.
[00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.290]  The Freedom Truckers, that's going on trial today.
[00:44:53.290 --> 00:45:01.890]  We are seeing full spectrum legal warfare from the overstate, from the regime on the
[00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:03.830]  forces of populism today.
[00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:07.730]  And it's setting the stage that any of these pie level dissidents, any powerful dissidents,
[00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:11.569]  whether going after you, Alex, whether going after me, so many others, Charlie Kirk.
[00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:15.930]  The reason that they're doing this is so that any voice of dissent will be taken
[00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.610]  out before this potentiality can come to pass.
[00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:24.270]  And if we let it gain critical mass, if we let it gain critical mass, then they will
[00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:27.890]  absolutely institute a hot war with Russia.
[00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:31.290]  And I tweeted this last week, and I got a lot of pushback on it from the neocons
[00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:35.810]  in DC because not only would they want to go to war with Russia for all those reasons,
[00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:39.450]  but at the same time, who are the people most likely to go and serve?
[00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:43.529]  Even if there was a draft or the volunteers, it would be people that are more likely to
[00:45:43.529 --> 00:45:47.850]  be conservative, more likely to be libertarian, more likely to be Trump supporters, more likely
[00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:48.850]  to be dissidents.
[00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:50.930]  They're going to be sending you guys all over to fight in Russia.
[00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.810]  They're going to be sending you a fight over for the freedom of Australia.
[00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:56.850]  And there's nothing they love more than seizing conservative institutions and using
[00:45:56.850 --> 00:45:57.850]  us for their will.
[00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:02.730]  And that's exactly my next point I wrote down before you went there, because, again,
[00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:03.970]  it's all interconnected.
[00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:05.630]  So roll through this.
[00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:08.569]  And Senator Josh Hawley about a month ago said, look, the Democrats are trying to outlaw
[00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:09.930]  the Republican Party.
[00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:11.450]  They're creating a one party state.
[00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:15.250]  And now the Democrats are actually talking about the Republicans being like a vestigial,
[00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:20.690]  ceremonial, regional party, even though populist-wise and numbers-wise, the Republican Party's
[00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:21.690]  exploding.
[00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:24.970]  So the Democrat Party is in a desperate position.
[00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:26.090]  They're losing public support.
[00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:27.090]  They're losing black support.
[00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:28.670]  They're losing Hispanic support.
[00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:29.850]  The world's seeing through them.
[00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:33.090]  There's a global awakening against the globalist.
[00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.569]  Their war is not going well, but they're not going to give up.
[00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:39.850]  They're going to double down, hence the indictments, hence the censorship, hence the
[00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:41.850]  UN treaties on health.
[00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:43.569]  And I totally agree with Tucker Carlson.
[00:46:43.569 --> 00:46:47.370]  I believe COVID, them trying to bring it back, is just to see if they can.
[00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:49.210]  I don't believe they'll be successful.
[00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:54.130]  Yes, they're now canceling concerts and closing high schools and colleges, and they've
[00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:55.210]  got a new booster route.
[00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:58.730]  And now they're scaring people with, oh, you know, the view host wasn't there.
[00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.730]  They're sick.
[00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.770]  They're clearly trying to see if they can get it.
[00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.450]  At least they'll get some more Pfizer shot money.
[00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:08.770]  At least they'll be able to lock down some more Democrat areas.
[00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:13.170]  They may try to do mail-in ballots in some key states because of kind of lingering COVID
[00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:14.170]  fear.
[00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:19.650]  But I agree, that's second fiddle now to being all in for escalation with war.
[00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:22.130]  And I get this question on the street.
[00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.130]  People ask Alexa this.
[00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:27.569]  It came out last week, and Alexa is just AI that scrapes the common knowledge.
[00:47:27.569 --> 00:47:32.290]  And whether it's right or not, Alexa said, no, there will be no election next year
[00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.930]  because of a permanent one-party system under the Democratic Party because of war with
[00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:36.930]  Russia and China.
[00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:41.410]  And then when you look at the real world, that's where they're shooting for, is a crisis
[00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:42.410]  so big.
[00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:43.930]  What's bigger than an expanded war?
[00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:46.069]  So break that down more.
[00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:49.250]  And then what do you think our messaging should be to warn the people?
[00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:52.529]  What should Congress do to get ahead of this madness?
[00:47:52.529 --> 00:47:55.690]  Alex, that's exactly right.
[00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.930]  And it is, you know, people will say, oh, it's just Alex Jones saying this.
[00:47:58.930 --> 00:47:59.990]  It's just Jack Posobick.
[00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.990]  It's Infowars.com.
[00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:01.990]  No.
[00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:06.490]  Strauss, how, when they did their generational theory all the way back in the 1990s, the
[00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:10.610]  original book, even earlier than that, they talked about the concept of turnings and
[00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:14.410]  the fourth turning of which we are currently in right now, the crisis phase.
[00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:19.790]  And Neil Howe is out with a new update saying the fourth turning is here.
[00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:22.130]  This book was just released a couple of weeks ago.
[00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:27.790]  And in the new book, Neil Howe actually predicts that the end of the crisis phase
[00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:33.210]  will not constitute for probably another 10 to 12 years.
[00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:37.450]  We may not see the end of the fourth turning until 2030, 2032, 2035.
[00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:44.290]  And by the way, the RAND Corporation has their own historical cycle template, but it matches
[00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.290]  that one.
[00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:48.690]  And the RAND Corporation, as you know, people that don't know, is basically the highest
[00:48:48.690 --> 00:48:53.130]  level of the Anglo-American brain.
[00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.130]  The RAND Corporation, that's all controlled releases.
[00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:59.490]  When you're reading a RAND Corporation release, you have to understand they speak with the
[00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.370]  voice of the world brain, right, from Brave New World.
[00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:03.810]  They are the world state.
[00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:08.710]  And so what Neil Howe has predicted that we have yet to actually see the beginning
[00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.370]  of the crisis yet.
[00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:15.210]  And so when you look at 9-11, when you look at the post 9-11 wars, when you look
[00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:21.029]  at the liquid national gas wars that have gone on, when you look at the financial
[00:49:21.029 --> 00:49:22.029]  crisis.
[00:49:22.029 --> 00:49:26.370]  So the financial crisis parallels the Great Depression, the global financial crisis parallels
[00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:27.569]  the Great Depression.
[00:49:27.569 --> 00:49:32.190]  However, the crisis itself has yet to actually begin.
[00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:38.710]  And they predict we are either headed for a global conflict throughout the world or a
[00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:42.590]  civil war inside the United States.
[00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.310]  These are the people that have been doing this for years.
[00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.790]  They're predicting this cycle all the way back to the glorious revolution of England
[00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:49.790]  in the 1600s.
[00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:52.590]  They predict that now to take place.
[00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:59.250]  And so if that were to take place, it is incumbent upon us to be on the side that
[00:49:59.250 --> 00:50:00.250]  wins it.
[00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:02.770]  So you have two doors, you have two doors.
[00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:04.630]  One door is the door of freedom.
[00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:05.630]  It is the door of liberty.
[00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.970]  It is the door of the establishment of a new American republic.
[00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:14.390]  And over at Human Events, we go through the nuts and bolts of that every single day.
[00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:20.090]  But the other door, Alex, this is the totalitarian superstate, the overstate that you have
[00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:23.569]  been discussing for so many years here, walking through.
[00:50:23.569 --> 00:50:27.490]  And I remember those great clips of Alex Jones from the 1990s saying NATO was going to
[00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:29.170]  be used as the world police force.
[00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:31.850]  And they said that was crazy and they said it was tinfoil.
[00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:33.810]  And now you look at what's going on around the world.
[00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:41.569]  You look at every single push by the way that these regimes have pushed themselves
[00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:42.569]  around the world.
[00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:46.290]  But then because of the rise of social media, because of the ability of social media
[00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:51.730]  to disintermediate those narratives, independent journalism, independent sites, InfoWars.com,
[00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:55.890]  Band.video, humanevents.com, now we have the tools to fight back.
[00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:59.090]  And Elon Musk, you know, love him or hate him.
[00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:05.730]  He's put $44 billion on the line and is at least giving people a fighting chance.
[00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:10.109]  And Alex, I think he should bring you back, but we're now also hearing stories that
[00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:14.970]  Elon Musk is facing pressure to ban people, to have advertisers pull out of the site.
[00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.370]  You have groups like the ADL doing this, but it's not just the ADL.
[00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:21.450]  And people need to understand that this isn't just one of these left-wing pressure groups.
[00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:26.890]  You've got the SPLC, you've probably got the CIA and FBI pulling the strings back there.
[00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.130]  All of these groups are doing everything they can to push back.
[00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:35.010]  And it's interesting, isn't it Alex, that suddenly right when Elon buys Twitter, all of a sudden
[00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:38.770]  these reports come out saying, oh, there's been a rise of extremism on Twitter.
[00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:41.109]  The hate speech is on the rise on Twitter.
[00:51:41.109 --> 00:51:42.529]  Hate is driving up.
[00:51:42.529 --> 00:51:43.609]  It's all coming up.
[00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:46.250]  It's all coming up and it's all Elon Musk's fault.
[00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.210]  So then what else do they do?
[00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:49.770]  Then they go after his other corporations.
[00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:51.130]  Now they're going to go after SpaceX.
[00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:52.130]  Now they're going to go after Tesla.
[00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:55.210]  They've got the Justice Department and the other agencies going after them all.
[00:51:55.210 --> 00:52:00.690]  So let me give you a big piece of intel and give the listeners this intel.
[00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:04.810]  And I learned this in the last few weeks and I just haven't been ready to talk about
[00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:11.390]  it yet because it's so big that I was really postulating to myself how to explain
[00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:12.390]  it the best.
[00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:13.690]  It would probably take an hour to go through it all.
[00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:17.290]  But I live here in Austin and I know some people that know Elon Musk very, very well.
[00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:19.490]  And I'm not going to say any names.
[00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:20.490]  But let's just say this.
[00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:24.410]  I've run into high-level Musk people, I've had some meetings with some people, and then
[00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:28.970]  I had a long conversation with one of his friends who's a very well-known podcaster.
[00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.090]  And I got just a lot of intel the last few months building up to this.
[00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:36.410]  And then I saw news articles that basically mirrored what I was being told.
[00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:40.390]  But they said, no, Elon is 100% pissed at The Globalist.
[00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:44.690]  He doesn't like the things they've done to him and other people.
[00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:46.050]  He's really upset about it.
[00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:49.250]  And he's got his people around him saying, back off.
[00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.970]  And he's going, no, I'm not backing off.
[00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:51.970]  These people are dangerous.
[00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:57.810]  So just like we see Bill Maher sounding like Jack Posobick now, or we see Tucker Carlson
[00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:01.450]  sounding like Alex Jones now, people that know him well go, no, no, no.
[00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:02.450]  It's not an act.
[00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:04.690]  It's not him trying to get both sides to like him.
[00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:06.470]  They've messed with him a bunch.
[00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:08.010]  And they're literally getting ready.
[00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:11.010]  His firstborn son is converting to a girl.
[00:53:11.010 --> 00:53:12.010]  He's trying to stop it.
[00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:16.010]  They're getting ready to chop, chop to having your son's testicles cut off will piss you
[00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:17.010]  off.
[00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:22.650]  Also, he had another baby that he believes died from sudden death syndrome that was really
[00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:23.650]  a vaccine.
[00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:27.810]  His brother almost died from the COVID shot, and a bunch of his employees got sick from
[00:53:27.810 --> 00:53:28.810]  it.
[00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:32.450]  And so I've had meetings, people that have had meetings with Musk, with him at dinner,
[00:53:32.450 --> 00:53:37.790]  with him at his house, at his factory, and Musk is literally ranting and raving.
[00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:42.569]  It was described by two people that, man, he sounds more wild than you.
[00:53:42.569 --> 00:53:47.730]  They said he will now, he's got a guy that does this, start ranting and get red-faced
[00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:48.970]  about these people.
[00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.410]  One description was, you know, hopping mad.
[00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:52.930]  So it's not a joke.
[00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:58.250]  And if they're going to kill anybody, I think Trump should really be saying his prayers,
[00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.250]  and so should Elon Musk.
[00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:03.250]  So I'm here officially saying, from my intel and what I've seen and the globalist attack
[00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:08.730]  on Musk, I believe he's come fully over to our side, Jack Pszczorek.
[00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:14.250]  Well, and it really is amazing, because you've also seen Elon Musk finally, I think, really
[00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:20.930]  start to open his eyes more towards the impact of ChatGPT, of AI, of OpenAI, these things
[00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:22.730]  that he's funded in the past.
[00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:24.130]  He started to turn his back on it.
[00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:29.250]  And really, I think when you're attacked by groups like the ADL, groups like the SPLC,
[00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:31.730]  groups like GLAD, the ACLU, I mean, we all know the list, right?
[00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:33.250]  We all know the list.
[00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.609]  And it's these pro-censorship groups.
[00:54:35.609 --> 00:54:40.569]  They're all part of the regime's censorship arm.
[00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:46.970]  Them attacking Elon Musk was a strategic mistake on their part, because Elon has the
[00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:51.810]  resources, has the wherewithal, and more importantly, has the mass support, the critical
[00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:56.569]  mass of support out in the public, because of his decade of goodwill that is out there.
[00:54:56.569 --> 00:54:57.569]  And sure, he has his detractors.
[00:54:57.569 --> 00:55:02.650]  And as you know, he just tweeted a week ago, they took my son away from me, the communist
[00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:03.650]  took my son.
[00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:04.650]  Yes.
[00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:05.690]  Yes.
[00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:06.690]  Right.
[00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.770]  What they've done is they've provoked him.
[00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:13.970]  And so I think that he's now starting to open his eyes to a lot of these organizations.
[00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:18.010]  I hope that he opens his eyes as well next to the Chinese Communist Party and
[00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:22.310]  stops dealing with them and is able to call them out on their abuses, on the way
[00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:24.550]  that they're completely tied into all of this.
[00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:25.770]  And look, I get it, Alex.
[00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:29.529]  I've seen people that were asleep that have now become woken.
[00:55:29.529 --> 00:55:33.490]  And I'm hoping, I'm hoping that what we're viewing and potentially what you're saying
[00:55:33.529 --> 00:55:36.930]  is, is that he has gone through an awakening.
[00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:39.330]  Has Elon Musk gone through an awakening?
[00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:45.410]  And if he has, he could become the most powerful enemy of the regime and defender
[00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:50.690]  of freedom, champion of freedom since, dare I say it, the start of Infowars.com.
[00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:55.130]  Why doesn't, why don't the ADL and Democratic Party and people get soft power come a lot
[00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:56.130]  further?
[00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:59.609]  Why do they come out and just attack people right off the bat that have done nothing
[00:55:59.609 --> 00:56:00.609]  to them?
[00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:04.490]  I guess because it works on some people and they just bow down, but they've got to know
[00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.930]  statistically, a lot of folks aren't going to bow down to threats.
[00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:09.950]  Look, Alex, this is what always worked in the past.
[00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:14.130]  Before they, before we had the ability to disintermediate their signal, remember, these
[00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:15.730]  people controlled the universe.
[00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:17.090]  These were the masters of the universe.
[00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:19.730]  If they wanted you to be, you know, before we had the word for it, if they wanted
[00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:21.090]  you canceled, you were canceled.
[00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:23.470]  If they wanted a candidate that was gone, they were gone.
[00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:26.130]  If you're Richard Nixon and you're saying you're not going to, you know, you're
[00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:29.330]  going to pull out Vietnam, you're going to do all this other stuff, then done, fine.
[00:56:29.330 --> 00:56:30.330]  He's out.
[00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.170]  He's going to be out and he's going to be dirtied up by the Wall Street Journal, excuse
[00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:34.730]  me, the Washington Post.
[00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:37.569]  He's going to be done by Deep Throat, who was the assistant director of the FBI.
[00:56:37.569 --> 00:56:39.830]  If you're JFK, well, we know what happened to him.
[00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:41.390]  So the same thing with Trump.
[00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:47.210]  They are used to be able to taking out people using these practices that were perfected
[00:56:47.210 --> 00:56:52.450]  by the East German Stasi because they realized that after the 1960s, that in the era
[00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:55.790]  of mass media, you can't just go around assassinating people or throwing people
[00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:56.790]  into the gulag.
[00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:58.430]  So what do you have to do?
[00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:00.310]  Assassination by character.
[00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:03.310]  Assassination by destroying someone's reputation.
[00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:05.390]  Destroy someone in the public eye.
[00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:09.230]  And you have killed by killing the idea of the man, then you have killed the man
[00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:10.230]  himself.
[00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:11.230]  But now we're going to break.
[00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.990]  Jack was our guest 31 minutes.
[00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:16.630]  But now the globalist state is so discredited, so hated.
[00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:18.310]  Everybody just thinks the opposite of whatever they say.
[00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.430]  So in a way, they're running out of propaganda bullets.
[00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:22.590]  They're losing their power.
[00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:27.190]  And this and this is why you are seeing the full spectrum legal dominance on display
[00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:28.190]  right now.
[00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:32.510]  Now they have to bring back the show trials because they've lost all of their soft power.
[00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:35.750]  That's why Ken Paxson is on show trial, Trump's going on show trial, you had your
[00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:36.750]  show trial.
[00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:37.750]  We're all going to be given.
[00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.630]  Everyone's getting their show trial these days because that's all they have left.
[00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:44.830]  Hard power to go after the American people and to go after patriots.
[00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:46.750]  Wow, Jack Pacific, same with us, we'll be right back.
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:53.960]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.400]  really, really, really good news.

[00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:01.320]  of 360 Wind.

[00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:57.810]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:16.810]  All right, I was just talking to Jack during the break, Jack DeSobic, humanevents.com,
[01:00:16.810 --> 01:00:20.930]  and I was saying, what do you want to hit next, shall we get into the Nazis, obviously
[01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:27.090]  National Front's Fed run, this new ridiculous group that basically are Red Devil outfits.
[01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:30.690]  It's got Fed written all over it, but let's do that next segment when some stations
[01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:32.490]  join us.
[01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:35.110]  I want to get back into what you were talking about earlier, because the song Mission
[01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:37.130]  Impossible made me think of this.
[01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:40.510]  This is not a Mission Impossible, you're totally right, we're at a fork in the road, there's
[01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:41.990]  two doors.
[01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:45.310]  And the globalists in their own white papers, as you know, say they're in trouble, they're
[01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:49.590]  losing control, there's counter narratives of freedom and liberty and renaissance, and
[01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:50.590]  all of this.
[01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:53.810]  They're not going to be able, during this liquefaction period, where things are
[01:00:53.810 --> 01:00:59.630]  frozen in normal cycles, then for a decade or so, they liquefy politically, so things
[01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:02.430]  will be moved and changed, a revolutionary period.
[01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:05.070]  Well that, it's like Super Mario Brothers, when he gets the mushroom, he's like
[01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:06.870]  a Superman for a little while.
[01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:12.190]  Later in that phase, the enemy has superpowers, we have superpowers, during this little flux
[01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:16.430]  phase, but if we just sit there and are passive spectators, they'll be able to rework the
[01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:18.890]  world in Klaus Schwab's ridiculous view.
[01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:21.430]  But if we just challenge it, then it's game over.
[01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:25.270]  So I think it's important to give people some hope, and can you elaborate on that thought,
[01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:27.070]  and then what do we do to stop this?
[01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:33.370]  Right Steve, because keep in mind that the leaders of the globalist American order,
[01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:37.290]  the leaders of the overstate, as I call it, because it goes beyond government, right,
[01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:41.310]  as you've outlined, it goes completely beyond government, they are now considering,
[01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:47.290]  at this point, ways in which they can degrade the Russia-China alliance, the rise
[01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:48.290]  of BRICS.
[01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:55.210]  This is all precipitated by the decline of the petrodollar, the US dollar, the threats
[01:01:55.210 --> 01:02:00.890]  to the US dollar, and if you think the US government is corrupt and incompetent
[01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:07.130]  and incapable, okay sure, but watch what the US government does when the petrodollar
[01:02:07.130 --> 01:02:08.650]  is threatened.
[01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:10.070]  Look what happened to Gaddafi.
[01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:13.530]  Look at the way they bayoneted him to death.
[01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:15.770]  Look at the way they went after Assad.
[01:02:15.770 --> 01:02:20.710]  Look at by inadvertently creating ISIS, or perhaps deliberately, shall we say.
[01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:26.970]  This is exactly the kind of discussions that are going on right now behind closed doors.
[01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:33.730]  Does the G7 essentially declare economic and then military war against BRICS?
[01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:38.490]  And so when we talk about war against Russia, hot war against Russia, understand
[01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:43.450]  that this isn't because they believe that Russia represents some kind of existential
[01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:44.570]  threat to the United States.
[01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:45.570]  They don't.
[01:02:45.570 --> 01:02:46.570]  They're not threatening us.
[01:02:46.570 --> 01:02:50.810]  I don't know anyone in my family or my area that's been killed by Russians, at least
[01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:56.650]  not in this century, or we can talk about World War II, but you know what I mean.
[01:02:56.650 --> 01:03:03.550]  The point being is, the point being is, they represent a threat to the order.
[01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:04.550]  This is what I'm talking about.
[01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:07.650]  They represent a threat to the order because you've got three superpowers in the world
[01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.650]  right now.
[01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:11.610]  You've got the United States, which is in decline, West is completely in decline,
[01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:13.790]  and I'm sick of even arguing with people about it.
[01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.970]  We are in decline.
[01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:15.970]  Dollar is in decline.
[01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:18.370]  We have inflation like absolute crazy right now.
[01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:20.450]  You go to Asia, you can go to some of these countries where people don't have the
[01:03:20.450 --> 01:03:23.130]  inflation like we do, and you can see how people live.
[01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.770]  It is not like it is here, and it's not.
[01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:25.770]  It's just not.
[01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:28.930]  The order of living is so much higher, even across most of Europe.
[01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:33.410]  Then you've got China and you've got Russia, China, the most populous nation, Russia, the
[01:03:33.410 --> 01:03:38.690]  nation that has, again, massive oil reserves and the world's largest nuclear supply.
[01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:42.290]  So when you're in a situation like that, the situation for us geopolitically speaking
[01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:43.770]  is very simple.
[01:03:43.770 --> 01:03:45.610]  Even Kissinger understood this.
[01:03:45.610 --> 01:03:51.770]  Do you want the worst possible thing you could do is have the two other superpowers
[01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:55.350]  aligned together against you?
[01:03:55.350 --> 01:04:01.750]  The goal of United States foreign policy should be to separate those two powers, isolate
[01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:08.110]  them, and then be willing to work to number one, calm tensions, work with unilateral trade
[01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:13.270]  agreements in various areas, break apart a system of globalization, stop pushing this
[01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:19.910]  insane agenda of globalization, but Steve, or excuse me, Alex, what they're doing,
[01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:21.630]  what they're doing is the opposite.
[01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:24.630]  They're putting the West on war footing.
[01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:27.910]  Why do you think they're taking control of the production lines?
[01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:30.630]  Why do you think they want to introduce the COVID lockdowns?
[01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:35.750]  I would even, I would even challenge you, Alex, do you think they're reintroducing
[01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:42.990]  the COVID mandates, reintroducing the policies because it actually sets up the United States
[01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:45.030]  to be on war footing on a national level?
[01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:46.830]  Oh, I think you're totally right.
[01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:51.630]  And then that's what we see is, is them bringing us into the permanent crisis ahead
[01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:53.510]  of a major expansion of the war.
[01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:59.390]  Back in 60 seconds with Jack Pishove at human events.com.
[01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:00.950]  It's just a mask.
[01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:02.770]  It's just six feet.
[01:05:02.770 --> 01:05:05.310]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:07.750]  It's just non-essential workers.
[01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:10.270]  It's just until we work it out.
[01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:11.830]  It's just a bar.
[01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:13.990]  It's just a restaurant.
[01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:15.910]  It's just nursing homes.
[01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:17.710]  It's just schools.
[01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:21.070]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:23.670]  It's just until the cases go down.
[01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.910]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.750]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:31.170]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:35.750]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:38.230]  It's just churches and mosques.
[01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.950]  It's just singing.
[01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:42.590]  It's just travel.
[01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:45.070]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:47.070]  It's just for the greater good.
[01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:50.950]  It's just fact checking, not censorship.
[01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:52.790]  It's just mandatory.
[01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:54.670]  It isn't just at all.
[01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:58.150]  Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
[01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:10.190]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:14.310]  it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines
[01:06:14.310 --> 01:06:17.350]  of the Infowar.
[01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:19.550]  Well, Human Events is an awesome organization.
[01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:22.270]  They've been subscribing to it for 30 plus years.
[01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.830]  And they've done a great job launching their multimedia TV
[01:06:24.830 --> 01:06:25.330]  program.
[01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:27.630]  And their main anchor, Jack Posobick, is with us.
[01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:30.710]  He's got a great political background advising Trump
[01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:32.790]  and really breaking so many big stories.
[01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:34.270]  And of course, he's also a naval intelligence
[01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:36.230]  that lived in China and has had a lot of experience
[01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.230]  with what's happening.
[01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:39.110]  And he's dead on with what he's saying.
[01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:42.830]  So we were talking about the fact that the West is declining.
[01:06:42.830 --> 01:06:45.790]  And instead of trying to make deals and work with people
[01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:47.910]  and trying to split China and Russia, which has always
[01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:50.790]  been the US policy since the end of World War II
[01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:53.350]  or since Mao came to power in 49,
[01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:54.910]  instead they've aligned them.
[01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:56.550]  Kissinger says it's a bad idea.
[01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:58.670]  General Flynn told him not to do it.
[01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:00.870]  So there's a lot of insane arrogance here.
[01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:02.390]  And then having Biden stumble around,
[01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:05.550]  even though he doesn't run things, the rest of the world
[01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:07.810]  sees that and thinks we're very, very weak.
[01:07:07.810 --> 01:07:09.150]  And then we see pre-programming.
[01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.470]  I asked Jack during the one-minute break.
[01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:12.390]  I said, are you worried about false flags?
[01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:13.950]  He said, absolutely, they're going
[01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:16.870]  to pull something big and claim right-wing Trump supporters
[01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:17.870]  are doing it with Russia.
[01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:20.270]  Now, there's no evidence of that, but that's the narrative.
[01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:23.810]  I immediately remembered the FBI has come out and said,
[01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:26.110]  oh, white supremacists with no evidence
[01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:28.190]  are attacking the power grid, and they're
[01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:30.830]  going to do it in a cyber attack with the Russians.
[01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:33.350]  Now, no evidence of that, completely ridiculous,
[01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.630]  but you can take down part of the power grid, blame it
[01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:38.350]  then on Trump supporters.
[01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:41.310]  Or you can assassinate Biden and blame it on Trump supporters.
[01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:43.250]  And they've really fired up the National
[01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:47.210]  Front and these other clearly synthetic globalist-fed fake
[01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:50.610]  faux Nazi groups to the point of I've run into them twice
[01:07:50.610 --> 01:07:53.450]  in Austin in just the last three months,
[01:07:53.450 --> 01:07:57.130]  doing a banner hang on 35, driving around recklessly,
[01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.530]  yelling at people out of the backs of trucks, big groups
[01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:02.530]  of them, clearly obviously synthetic, a lot of them
[01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:04.650]  been connected to the feds, proven to be fed.
[01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:07.250]  So we see them warming this up and firing it up
[01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.770]  to create the illusion that this army
[01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:11.490]  of white supremacist Trump supporters
[01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:15.290]  exist ahead of, I believe, a major false flag event.
[01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:17.090]  What could it be, Jack Pacific?
[01:08:18.450 --> 01:08:20.730]  Well, Alex, I think that's exactly right
[01:08:20.730 --> 01:08:24.650]  because what will happen is there will be
[01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:27.950]  a power grid attack, a cyber attack.
[01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:30.590]  Remember that those power grids, the power generators
[01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.590]  outside of Fort Bragg or whatever they call it now,
[01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:35.930]  were attacked last year.
[01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.010]  Part of the base lost power.
[01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:40.150]  And when they looked at it, they said,
[01:08:40.150 --> 01:08:41.650]  this thing has been shot.
[01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:43.530]  This was an act of sabotage.
[01:08:43.570 --> 01:08:47.210]  Now, look, we have to be clear-eyed about this.
[01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:52.210]  If Russia wants to insert sabotage teams inside U.S. soil
[01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:54.170]  and conduct attacks like this,
[01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:56.370]  they're very capable of doing that.
[01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:58.970]  They're very capable of hitting the U.S. power grid.
[01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:01.010]  And you've seen the Chinese have been hitting
[01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:03.290]  U.S. bases for years now.
[01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:04.570]  Wall Street Journal's did a piece on this,
[01:09:04.570 --> 01:09:05.570]  but they've been doing it for years,
[01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:07.810]  coming on bases, oh, we're just a bunch of tourists.
[01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:11.350]  We're not here scoping out all of your installations,
[01:09:11.350 --> 01:09:12.290]  all of your infrastructure.
[01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:14.330]  We're not going after your Dyson networks.
[01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:15.290]  We're not going after all those.
[01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:18.690]  Of course, China's all the way in on our SIPR terminals.
[01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:20.330]  China's all the way in on so many
[01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:21.770]  of the U.S. intelligence programs,
[01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:23.450]  not to mention our bioweapons programs
[01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:24.290]  and everything else.
[01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.290]  So there's no question that we are easily
[01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:29.050]  penetrated by China and Russia
[01:09:29.050 --> 01:09:31.370]  because we don't take our security seriously.
[01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:32.930]  We don't take any of this seriously.
[01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:35.450]  The problem, actually, though,
[01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:37.690]  for if there would be some false flag,
[01:09:37.690 --> 01:09:38.590]  they blame it on Russia.
[01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:40.730]  They claim Trump supporters and Russia working together.
[01:09:40.730 --> 01:09:43.570]  Of course, that has been predictive programming
[01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:45.130]  for about a decade at this point.
[01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:48.650]  The problem for them is that prior to
[01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:50.290]  the current era, if you will,
[01:09:50.290 --> 01:09:53.650]  in the initial iteration of the Maidan coup
[01:09:53.650 --> 01:09:58.170]  between with Ukraine and working with international groups
[01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.450]  like this Azov group and white supremacists
[01:10:00.450 --> 01:10:02.090]  is that they were actually bringing in
[01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:05.130]  many of the same people that you see associated
[01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:06.850]  with these neo-Nazi groups, Alex,
[01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:09.390]  that you're talking about here, Right Sector and others,
[01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:10.990]  that they were bringing them to fight,
[01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:12.990]  not for Russia, they were bringing them to fight
[01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:15.770]  on behalf of Ukraine and Russia.
[01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:18.110]  And so this is where you're running into
[01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:21.190]  these problems for the narrative,
[01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:24.670]  which of course are being exploited by Russian TV
[01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:26.190]  and others to say, well, wait a minute,
[01:10:26.190 --> 01:10:29.510]  these neo-Nazis are on the side of Ukraine.
[01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:30.670]  They're not on the side of Russia.
[01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:34.030]  They're actually being used by the U.S. government
[01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:37.550]  and maybe we're seeing the regime reallocating assets
[01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.430]  to go from, well, the counter offense
[01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:40.990]  has been a complete failure in Ukraine,
[01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:43.050]  so now we're gonna drag them all the way back
[01:10:43.050 --> 01:10:44.550]  to the United States.
[01:10:44.550 --> 01:10:45.890]  And I would be skeptical, by the way,
[01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:48.630]  of any of the direct claims of these people
[01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:51.910]  as to when exactly they were there, what exactly they did
[01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:54.630]  but I would also say, Alex,
[01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:56.870]  that these are the very same people,
[01:10:56.870 --> 01:11:00.750]  the very same people that the feds love to work with.
[01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:02.790]  You get somebody who's an extremist,
[01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:06.070]  somebody who's into online culture, LARPing,
[01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:08.070]  this guy that you just showed there, Boneface,
[01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:10.590]  was a former rapper, his rap career didn't take off,
[01:11:10.590 --> 01:11:13.190]  he ended up catching some charges, went to jail,
[01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:15.030]  that's exactly who you wanna go after,
[01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:16.710]  someone that you have leverage over
[01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:18.230]  and then you go to them and make a deal
[01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:20.110]  and you say, well, if you do this for us,
[01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:20.950]  we'll get you out.
[01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:22.650]  Well, exactly, if you look at these guys,
[01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:25.790]  they look like a white supremacist gang out of a prison
[01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:26.630]  and that's what they do
[01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:28.670]  and then the currency the feds have is,
[01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:31.190]  we won't charge you or we'll drop charges
[01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:34.630]  if you go out and act like a complete lunatic and do this.
[01:11:34.630 --> 01:11:36.630]  Yeah, they'll catch you for meth dealing,
[01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:37.830]  they'll catch you for whatever it is
[01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:39.750]  and they say, okay, now you're gonna be our guy,
[01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.230]  you're gonna be our group
[01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.830]  and of course, they'll do it in the name of saying,
[01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:45.430]  well, if one of these groups were to start,
[01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:46.870]  by the way, they did this with the Muslims
[01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.830]  all throughout the War on Terror,
[01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:50.030]  all throughout the War on Terror.
[01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:51.150]  So many of these cells
[01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:53.110]  were completely controlled by the FBI.
[01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:55.070]  You can see the guy actually in the background right there.
[01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:56.670]  So these are the same types of groups
[01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:59.270]  that the FBI loves to, not only,
[01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:00.310]  and this is what people need to understand,
[01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:02.290]  they're not just infiltrating these groups,
[01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:05.330]  they are actually creating them in many cases,
[01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:07.210]  just like that militia up in Michigan.
[01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:10.330]  These are actually creations of the FBI,
[01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:12.890]  meant to, they're called fed plants or fed pots.
[01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:16.730]  They are created to bring in people
[01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:19.250]  that may otherwise not have done any of these things.
[01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:22.690]  And so what does this signify that,
[01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:24.650]  that suddenly we're seeing a giant proliferation
[01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:26.850]  of these groups with the pre-programming
[01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:28.970]  that Trump supporters are white supremacists
[01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:30.210]  and they're about to attack you.
[01:12:30.370 --> 01:12:33.190]  But I see black folks on Twitter and everywhere,
[01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:34.570]  not just a few of the majority
[01:12:34.570 --> 01:12:35.850]  seeing right through this.
[01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:37.810]  So it doesn't look like it's working.
[01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:42.910]  Well, Alex, remember, it's not about us buying it,
[01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:45.670]  it's about whether or not we actually do anything about it
[01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:47.650]  because the question then becomes
[01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:51.090]  for the Republican Party, which many times is up there,
[01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:52.170]  we could put them in office,
[01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:54.590]  and the question is, what do they actually do for us?
[01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:56.010]  Well, in the state of Texas right now,
[01:12:56.010 --> 01:12:57.750]  they're going after Ken Paxton
[01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.890]  rather than actually investigating
[01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:01.290]  any of these people for their crimes
[01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:03.930]  or any of these agencies or people in high power.
[01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:07.450]  Instead, what we see is the Republicans get in
[01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:09.850]  and aren't actually going after the money,
[01:13:09.850 --> 01:13:12.290]  aren't actually putting out the receipts
[01:13:12.290 --> 01:13:14.530]  that we need to be able to lock up
[01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:15.990]  the other side of the regime
[01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.830]  because that's the only way
[01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:17.890]  the law fair is gonna stop, Alex.
[01:13:17.890 --> 01:13:20.850]  The only way it stops is if we put Democrats behind bars.
[01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:21.970]  And it's as simple as that.
[01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:23.410]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:13:23.410 --> 01:13:24.610]  Oh, that's crazy.
[01:13:24.610 --> 01:13:26.370]  But you have to do this.
[01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:28.370]  And Republican DAs and Republican AGs,
[01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:29.850]  that's why they're going after Paxton right now
[01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:32.410]  because he would be the first one to step up and do this
[01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:33.610]  if he wasn't being impeached
[01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:36.130]  and on trial right now in Austin.
[01:13:36.130 --> 01:13:37.690]  Instead, you've got groups like this
[01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:40.690]  running around rampant because the regime will use them,
[01:13:40.690 --> 01:13:44.810]  and then they will claim this is all Trump supporters.
[01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:46.770]  They will smear it the same way they incited a riot
[01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:48.370]  on January 6th to stop.
[01:13:48.370 --> 01:13:49.650]  And it remains to be said,
[01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:51.210]  and we have to say it over and over,
[01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:55.290]  the riot was incited by the feds on January 6th
[01:13:55.290 --> 01:13:57.530]  because they did not and they could not
[01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:00.410]  let that debate take place in the well of the Senate
[01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:03.850]  about the corruption of the 2020 election,
[01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:05.010]  the rigging of that election.
[01:14:05.010 --> 01:14:06.130]  They couldn't let it happen.
[01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:08.010]  And Alex, that's why I always post that video
[01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:10.090]  of you standing atop, I think it's a car.
[01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:13.050]  You're up there telling people, go away from the Capitol.
[01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:14.930]  Do not give them what they want.
[01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:16.890]  And all the times they try to smear you about it.
[01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:19.250]  And I just post that video over and over again
[01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:23.410]  because you saw the psychological operation in real time.
[01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:26.530]  Now we're trying to call it ahead of the,
[01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:28.770]  ahead of the actual operation itself.
[01:14:28.770 --> 01:14:31.170]  We're seeing the pieces put in place
[01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:34.490]  for a massive escalation against Trump supporters,
[01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:37.010]  against conservatives, against patriots,
[01:14:37.010 --> 01:14:38.930]  tying us all directly to Russia,
[01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:41.770]  and then using the power of the national security state
[01:14:41.770 --> 01:14:42.610]  against all of us.
[01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:45.570]  So Alex, it's not about whether the American people buy it.
[01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:47.730]  It's about whether or not the American people
[01:14:47.730 --> 01:14:49.730]  do something to stop it.
[01:14:49.730 --> 01:14:50.570]  I agree with you.
[01:14:50.570 --> 01:14:53.010]  So you brought up Ken Paxson, a great guy,
[01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:54.170]  done absolutely nothing wrong.
[01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:56.930]  They're claiming a guy that was a donor, that's a builder,
[01:14:56.930 --> 01:15:00.730]  that he paid him to redo his bedroom or bathroom.
[01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:03.810]  I mean, that's his best thing they've got here.
[01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:07.330]  But we see a tactic by the feds and by the Democrats
[01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:12.170]  to swarm Trump with a bunch of indictments,
[01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:15.090]  not just to pin Trump down, but to also,
[01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.970]  so we can't just go investigate one of the DAs
[01:15:17.970 --> 01:15:21.210]  or one of the prosecutors who all have huge corruption,
[01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.930]  bad histories of being overturned, you name it.
[01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:27.330]  And so we see their thinking.
[01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:28.970]  They know Paxson's the only,
[01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:30.410]  other than now a few other attorney generals,
[01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:32.530]  Louisiana and Missouri,
[01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:34.090]  and I guess look for indictments against them
[01:15:34.090 --> 01:15:36.210]  or impeachment against them,
[01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:39.970]  to actually go after the UN cutting off our power,
[01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.770]  go after BlackRock,
[01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:44.330]  go after all the things the Democrats are doing
[01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:45.530]  and standing up for Trump.
[01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:47.530]  So they say, hey, make an example out of him.
[01:15:47.530 --> 01:15:50.370]  But if more Republican leaders, governors,
[01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:52.610]  attorney generals, you name it,
[01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:54.610]  said, you know what, we're not cowards.
[01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:56.650]  We're all gonna have our own criminal indictments,
[01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:58.490]  our own investigations.
[01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:59.850]  You can't get us all.
[01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:01.010]  That's really the answer
[01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:02.690]  because the Republicans aren't corrupt
[01:16:02.690 --> 01:16:04.890]  at 1-100 the level of Democrats.
[01:16:04.890 --> 01:16:07.210]  Almost all these charges and investigations
[01:16:07.210 --> 01:16:08.770]  are completely made up and fake
[01:16:08.770 --> 01:16:10.610]  as we know with Trump and Paxton.
[01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:12.330]  And so we just need to see some courage,
[01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:14.490]  but it is the average Republican leader,
[01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:15.890]  even in Congress,
[01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:17.730]  is scared because they know the power
[01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:19.530]  of the Justice Department to set them up.
[01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:20.930]  How do we get past that?
[01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:24.050]  Well, Alex, that's where it's incumbent
[01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:27.130]  upon the members of your audience, of my audience.
[01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:31.450]  We must face them with firm resolve in our hearts
[01:16:31.450 --> 01:16:35.010]  to understand that they're only doing this
[01:16:35.010 --> 01:16:37.170]  because we have brought them
[01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:39.250]  to the point of this desperation.
[01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:41.210]  They are lashing out like this
[01:16:41.210 --> 01:16:45.370]  because our patriot movement has brought their anger,
[01:16:45.370 --> 01:16:47.170]  has brought their evil,
[01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:49.330]  has brought their corruption to the forefront.
[01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:50.890]  They've gone full mask off, Alex.
[01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:52.050]  Full mask off.
[01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:53.450]  They're not the side that cares.
[01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:54.730]  They're not the side that's tolerant.
[01:16:54.730 --> 01:16:56.290]  No, they're the side that wants
[01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:58.490]  to mutilate your children sexually
[01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:00.130]  and the side that wants to groom them
[01:17:00.130 --> 01:17:02.170]  plus put dissidents in jail.
[01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:03.010]  That's who they are.
[01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:04.330]  That's who they've always been.
[01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:06.010]  We know these people are scum.
[01:17:06.010 --> 01:17:08.690]  And so in order to continue, Alex,
[01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:10.330]  all we gotta do is finish the job.
[01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:13.810]  We are 85, 90% of the way there.
[01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:15.770]  That is why they're lashing out
[01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:18.530]  because they don't have anything left.
[01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:20.290]  That's why, whether it takes us going
[01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:21.690]  and calling these Republicans,
[01:17:21.690 --> 01:17:23.810]  whether it takes us voting them out of office,
[01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:26.410]  primarying Republicans that refuse to do their job,
[01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:27.890]  I'm for all of it.
[01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:30.690]  And I will always be harder on Republicans
[01:17:30.690 --> 01:17:31.930]  because that's my side.
[01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:33.770]  That's the side that says,
[01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:35.850]  I'm gonna get up and represent you
[01:17:35.850 --> 01:17:37.010]  and represent your beliefs.
[01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:38.970]  And you're gonna use my phrases.
[01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:40.250]  You're gonna use my words.
[01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:41.410]  You're gonna go after my people
[01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:43.530]  for contributions, for support, for the time.
[01:17:43.530 --> 01:17:44.370]  No more.
[01:17:44.370 --> 01:17:47.090]  I say cut off all financial support
[01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:49.250]  to Republicans who refuse to go in with this.
[01:17:49.290 --> 01:17:51.530]  Cut off all financial support to organizations
[01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:52.730]  that are on board with this,
[01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:53.570]  who don't understand.
[01:17:53.570 --> 01:17:54.410]  No, Jack, you're right.
[01:17:54.410 --> 01:17:55.250]  You're right.
[01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:57.690]  The real power we have is to clean up our own house
[01:17:57.690 --> 01:17:59.330]  and make Republicans do their job,
[01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:00.490]  which is starting to happen.
[01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:01.490]  We only got about 10 minutes left,
[01:18:01.490 --> 01:18:02.610]  so I want to shift gears.
[01:18:02.610 --> 01:18:03.930]  There's something you're really an expert on,
[01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:05.050]  and that's race specific
[01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:07.550]  and race individual bio weapons
[01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:08.930]  and a lot of this big news coming out
[01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:10.490]  that I'm gonna be breaking throughout the week.
[01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:12.190]  This is gonna be absolutely huge.
[01:18:12.190 --> 01:18:13.850]  This is so incredibly important.
[01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:15.010]  But I want to go back to what you just said
[01:18:15.010 --> 01:18:16.970]  in closing on this subject.
[01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:18.690]  You're not a guy, and neither am I,
[01:18:19.170 --> 01:18:20.690]  that's gonna tell people about pie in the sky
[01:18:20.690 --> 01:18:23.350]  or stuff that doesn't exist.
[01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:24.690]  We're winning hearts and minds.
[01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:26.710]  We have the initiative.
[01:18:26.710 --> 01:18:28.370]  The globalists are masked off.
[01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.210]  They're desperate.
[01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:30.290]  They're doing this out of weakness,
[01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:32.170]  but it's so tyrannical.
[01:18:32.170 --> 01:18:33.410]  They're gambled so crazy.
[01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:36.090]  If we bow down or don't resist,
[01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:37.250]  they could convert us
[01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:39.450]  to a pure permanent one-party dictatorship.
[01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:42.050]  So, as you said, door number one, door number two.
[01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.250]  We're at the crossroads,
[01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:44.250]  but a lot of people go,
[01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.470]  well, then we better just shut up.
[01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:46.310]  We're not gonna stop this.
[01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:48.370]  No, what they're doing is so outrageous,
[01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:49.770]  and so destructive.
[01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:50.770]  They're failing on every front.
[01:18:50.770 --> 01:18:52.970]  They have whistleblowers coming on everywhere.
[01:18:52.970 --> 01:18:54.130]  And that's why I think you're right.
[01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:54.950]  And Tucker's right.
[01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:56.250]  They'll probably just go full war.
[01:18:56.250 --> 01:18:59.410]  And that's their final, insane card of death ace card.
[01:18:59.410 --> 01:19:00.750]  But just people need to know,
[01:19:00.750 --> 01:19:02.610]  it's bad any way we do it.
[01:19:02.610 --> 01:19:05.030]  It's much better if we resist still a rough road.
[01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:06.970]  If we lay down historically,
[01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:08.870]  these people are not gonna give us any quarter.
[01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:10.730]  These are real scum.
[01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:11.990]  Give me your view in 60 seconds
[01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:13.370]  before we hit this other big topic
[01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:16.610]  on the mindset of these entitled Ivy League globalists,
[01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:17.730]  because they couldn't fight their way
[01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:18.810]  to have a wet paper bag,
[01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:21.650]  but they can distribute responsibility
[01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:23.850]  where they never get individually held accountable.
[01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:26.250]  So they have this feeling of invincibility
[01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:27.410]  that is so dangerous,
[01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:28.810]  because they've never actually been
[01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:30.690]  on the street in the game.
[01:19:30.690 --> 01:19:32.630]  Anybody I know that's actually been around the world,
[01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:33.470]  done real things,
[01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:36.250]  they have respect for how dangerous the world is.
[01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:37.170]  They're not arrogant.
[01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:38.290]  They're not full of hubris.
[01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:40.270]  But these Ivy Leaguers,
[01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:43.210]  Victoria Nuland can't probably wipe her ass,
[01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:45.390]  but she's like, yeah, let's have nuclear war.
[01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:47.930]  It just smells of destruction.
[01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:51.070]  Well, Alex, remember,
[01:19:51.070 --> 01:19:53.230]  they don't care about our children.
[01:19:53.230 --> 01:19:55.030]  They don't care about our families.
[01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:57.070]  In fact, they want our children
[01:19:57.070 --> 01:19:58.990]  and our families to be dead.
[01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:00.990]  They don't care if they will go
[01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:03.590]  and enforce and incite violence
[01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:06.950]  against Republicans, conservatives, others.
[01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:08.150]  They see you.
[01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:10.070]  Remember, this is religious for them.
[01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:11.310]  This is theological.
[01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:14.430]  They believe they are Marxists
[01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:17.750]  pushing the vein of the progress of history.
[01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:22.030]  They are the state-sponsored acolytes
[01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:24.750]  and priests and deacons
[01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:29.350]  of this global state that Marx believed in.
[01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:32.710]  So it's not the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, right?
[01:20:32.710 --> 01:20:37.710]  It is the state, the idea, and the social spirit.
[01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:39.330]  And so this is why, to them,
[01:20:39.330 --> 01:20:41.790]  they will say LGBT,
[01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.390]  they'll say this is a sacred,
[01:20:43.430 --> 01:20:45.350]  a sacred individual, trans is sacred.
[01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:46.470]  It's all sacred to them
[01:20:46.470 --> 01:20:48.630]  because they believe it is all sacred.
[01:20:48.630 --> 01:20:50.670]  And so when I say false flag incoming,
[01:20:50.670 --> 01:20:52.950]  it's very clear, it's very clear.
[01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:56.110]  White supremacists tied to Russia
[01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:58.990]  conducting an attack inside the United States.
[01:20:58.990 --> 01:21:00.230]  Remember, Joe Biden,
[01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:03.070]  the guy's on vacation for 40, 50% of the time.
[01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:05.390]  They come up, what was the one speech he gave last week
[01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:07.090]  was to remind us that white supremacy
[01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:08.710]  is the largest threat in the United States.
[01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:09.710]  White supremacy is a threat.
[01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:10.550]  White supremacy is a threat.
[01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:13.190]  Why do they keep saying this over and over and over?
[01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:14.670]  You can look at the statistics.
[01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:15.490]  You can look at homicide.
[01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:16.330]  You could say, wait a minute,
[01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.150]  no, there's all sorts of stuff going on.
[01:21:17.150 --> 01:21:18.310]  There's crime on the rise,
[01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:19.670]  but there's lots of groups doing it.
[01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:21.430]  And this one, nowhere near number one.
[01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:22.810]  And he says it over and over
[01:21:22.810 --> 01:21:25.130]  because it's predictive programming.
[01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.390]  They will launch an attack.
[01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:28.190]  It will justify the rhetoric
[01:21:28.190 --> 01:21:31.350]  about white supremacists being public enemy number one,
[01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:33.210]  and they will smear all conservatives
[01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:35.590]  and dissidents as racists.
[01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:36.870]  And then this is the next part, Alex.
[01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:38.290]  This is the crucial part
[01:21:38.290 --> 01:21:41.750]  because if you are not willing to send your children,
[01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:42.950]  your sons and daughters,
[01:21:43.670 --> 01:21:44.830]  and I'm talking about mobilizing women
[01:21:44.830 --> 01:21:46.810]  over in Ukraine right now,
[01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:47.650]  and they're gonna say,
[01:21:47.650 --> 01:21:49.310]  we have to liberate the Crimean Tatars,
[01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:51.830]  and this is why they've just appointed a Crimean Tartar
[01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:53.670]  as now the new Ministry of Defense.
[01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:54.930]  They always find one group,
[01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:56.630]  and they say, oh, it's about the Kurds.
[01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:57.950]  We gotta liberate the Kurds.
[01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:59.270]  We gotta liberate the Tatars, right?
[01:21:59.270 --> 01:22:00.910]  It's all about the Crimean Tatars.
[01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:03.650]  If you're not willing to mobilize your children,
[01:22:03.650 --> 01:22:06.150]  if you're not willing to take your children
[01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:07.710]  and send them to their death
[01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:09.830]  on the killing fields of the bloodlands
[01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:11.430]  of Ukraine and Eastern Europe,
[01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:12.350]  you are a traitor,
[01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:14.910]  and you could be locked up and thrown in jail.
[01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:16.550]  We know they're willing to kill kids.
[01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:17.830]  We know they're willing to do worse,
[01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:18.890]  and they will do so more
[01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:21.710]  because they don't leave you as people.
[01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:23.310]  They've been positioning us for war
[01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:25.190]  with Russia for a decade,
[01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:28.270]  and anybody that just wants to have a basic life
[01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:30.090]  and doesn't want to turn their kids over to them,
[01:22:30.090 --> 01:22:31.510]  well, they're the anti-Russian,
[01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:34.070]  so being in opposition to them with open borders
[01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:36.470]  or anything, oh, you're now with the Russians,
[01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:37.590]  and now we're gonna lock you up
[01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:39.150]  because we're in a full war with Russia.
[01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:39.970]  That's their plan.
[01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:40.910]  I concur with you.
[01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:44.390]  They will inter-patriots the same way
[01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:46.730]  they inter-Japanese in World War II.
[01:22:46.730 --> 01:22:47.830]  This is life and death, folks.
[01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:48.750]  We take everything from us.
[01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:50.550]  We can't roll over to this.
[01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:51.950]  We only have about six minutes left.
[01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:53.070]  We can spend an hour on this,
[01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:54.350]  and I'm gonna be talking about it more
[01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:55.590]  after you're gone.
[01:22:55.590 --> 01:22:57.070]  It's a huge deal,
[01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:59.510]  but we have original articles like this one.
[01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:02.750]  Wuhan scientists plan to release coronavirus particles
[01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:03.890]  into cave bats.
[01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:06.070]  Leaked paper reveals London Telegraph, but it's not.
[01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:08.910]  It's nanotech spike protein
[01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:12.430]  that now we have top Pentagon DARPA officials
[01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:17.110]  and university heads all admitting before the virus
[01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:18.630]  that they were going to basically,
[01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:20.850]  and warning that this was gonna be released
[01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:25.330]  as a social control to basically hit America and stun us
[01:23:25.330 --> 01:23:27.550]  and make us so sick that we can't fight back.
[01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:30.470]  They actually say this in 2017,
[01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:33.830]  so just give us your gestalt of this story
[01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:35.630]  that we're gonna be developing and breaking
[01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:37.470]  here in the hours and days to come.
[01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:43.350]  I mean, you're by no means the first person
[01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:48.350]  that's brought up this idea of designer bioweapons,
[01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:50.630]  so this idea that,
[01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:52.370]  so a bioweapon is hard to use,
[01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:55.250]  and one of the reasons that they were so terrible
[01:23:55.250 --> 01:23:57.430]  and the most widespread use of chemical weapons
[01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:58.630]  that we saw, of course, in the battlefield
[01:23:58.630 --> 01:24:00.030]  was World War I.
[01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:02.490]  In fact, the same German scientist that created
[01:24:02.490 --> 01:24:04.730]  a lot of the artificial fertilizers
[01:24:04.730 --> 01:24:07.870]  also created some of the original chemical weapons,
[01:24:07.870 --> 01:24:09.110]  and he said, well, in peace time,
[01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:11.570]  I'm a patriot, in war time, I'm a patriot, right?
[01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:14.630]  And so we can see the same science
[01:24:14.630 --> 01:24:17.050]  is used for death and for life.
[01:24:17.050 --> 01:24:19.910]  So in this instance, what we're seeing now
[01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:23.190]  is all the DNA testing that's going on out there.
[01:24:23.190 --> 01:24:24.750]  We know the Chinese are conducting
[01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:29.430]  massive bio databases of genetic genomes.
[01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:32.210]  They're working with 23andMe to collect your data.
[01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:34.150]  Why do you think it's only 25 bucks, folks?
[01:24:34.150 --> 01:24:36.990]  Because China's underwriting it so they can get your DNA.
[01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:40.390]  New York Times has reported this, has been widely reported.
[01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:43.670]  We also saw at the Aspen Security Forum
[01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:48.670]  in 2021, or early 2022,
[01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:53.070]  where Crow and others were talking about the fact
[01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:54.910]  that China and Russia, and this is what they always say,
[01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:55.990]  they say it's China and Russia,
[01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:57.490]  but of course we're doing the exact same thing,
[01:24:57.490 --> 01:25:01.510]  that China and Russia are creating bioweapons
[01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:03.390]  that are able to be targeted,
[01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:08.070]  not based on just the human condition,
[01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:10.630]  but actually targeting specific DNA.
[01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:11.670]  What does this mean?
[01:25:11.670 --> 01:25:14.730]  This means that I can ingest the bioweapon,
[01:25:14.730 --> 01:25:16.710]  and then I can go around Alex Jones,
[01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:17.650]  and then I just breathe.
[01:25:17.650 --> 01:25:19.270]  Like that scene in Dune where he cracks the tooth,
[01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:21.950]  and I just breathe, and I take out Baron Harkonnen,
[01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.190]  but it only takes out one person in the room.
[01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:25.550]  It takes out you.
[01:25:25.550 --> 01:25:27.270]  This is why, by the way, and you think up,
[01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:28.770]  and you say, oh, that's nuts, that's crazy,
[01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:29.610]  that's an image, right?
[01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:31.190]  No, no, you warned of this three and a half years ago,
[01:25:31.190 --> 01:25:33.130]  and it's since then been admitted
[01:25:33.730 --> 01:25:36.570]  that they've been selling the COVID swab test
[01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:38.210]  to DNA companies.
[01:25:38.210 --> 01:25:41.010]  For the genomes, Emmanuel Macron,
[01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:43.170]  when Emmanuel Macron went to Russia,
[01:25:43.170 --> 01:25:45.210]  remember the long table, the giant long table
[01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:46.910]  that Emmanuel Macron had with Russia,
[01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:48.610]  and they said, why does he have the long table?
[01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:49.930]  What's the long table about?
[01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:51.610]  Why are they sitting so far apart?
[01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:55.150]  And they said Emmanuel Macron refused to take a COVID test
[01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:58.250]  before he met with Putin, and he actually said,
[01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:00.350]  and this is Reuters.com has it up,
[01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:02.290]  he refused to take the test
[01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.610]  because he was worried about Russia
[01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:07.970]  obtaining Macron's DNA genome.
[01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:11.490]  Why did Macron not want Russia to have his DNA?
[01:26:11.490 --> 01:26:14.130]  It's very simple, because he didn't want them
[01:26:14.130 --> 01:26:16.610]  to be able to design a bioweapon
[01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:18.290]  that could be used to take him out.
[01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:21.670]  Now, why would he think that the Russians have that?
[01:26:21.670 --> 01:26:24.130]  Because he knows that the West has that.
[01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:25.450]  It's very simple.
[01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:28.650]  This is the biological arms race
[01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.650]  that is actually going on behind the scenes,
[01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:33.210]  and it spills out every once in a while
[01:26:33.210 --> 01:26:34.810]  in stories like this.
[01:26:34.810 --> 01:26:36.530]  That's why they had the long table.
[01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:38.490]  That's why he wouldn't take the COVID test,
[01:26:38.490 --> 01:26:40.650]  because these weapons are real.
[01:26:40.650 --> 01:26:44.370]  This biological weapons race, biological arms race,
[01:26:44.370 --> 01:26:46.770]  at the same time going on concurrently
[01:26:46.770 --> 01:26:49.730]  with the AI arms race is actually
[01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:52.370]  the new nuclear arms race of the 21st century,
[01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:55.010]  because it isn't about killing indiscriminately.
[01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.850]  It's about killing anyone you want,
[01:26:56.850 --> 01:26:58.850]  anywhere you want, anytime you want,
[01:26:58.890 --> 01:27:01.690]  and not having any fingerprints tracking back to you.
[01:27:02.890 --> 01:27:05.170]  Exactly, and here I am watching these DARPA.
[01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:08.290]  These are DARPA leaders, DARPA heads.
[01:27:08.290 --> 01:27:09.810]  I've probably watched five hours since
[01:27:09.810 --> 01:27:11.370]  I found this yesterday, and again,
[01:27:11.370 --> 01:27:12.210]  I already knew about some of it,
[01:27:12.210 --> 01:27:13.030]  but I didn't understand.
[01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:15.470]  This was 2017, 2018.
[01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:19.210]  They're saying specifically, we now have rapid systems.
[01:27:19.210 --> 01:27:22.690]  This is not classified that can gene edit something
[01:27:22.690 --> 01:27:24.050]  for a specific person.
[01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:25.330]  That's total gain of function.
[01:27:25.330 --> 01:27:28.170]  It's illegal, and then these head scientists go,
[01:27:28.210 --> 01:27:29.810]  we are discreet, we're doing it here,
[01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:30.870]  because it's not really legal,
[01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:32.410]  but in China, it's legal,
[01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:34.110]  so they're probably way ahead of us,
[01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:36.170]  and they're there in these conferences
[01:27:36.170 --> 01:27:38.170]  at the Pentagon admitting it all.
[01:27:38.170 --> 01:27:39.010]  It's-
[01:27:39.010 --> 01:27:41.230]  The test centers are all in China, of course.
[01:27:41.230 --> 01:27:42.770]  Wow.
[01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:43.690]  We only got a minute left.
[01:27:43.690 --> 01:27:44.650]  Check the subject.
[01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:45.670]  They used the test centers there,
[01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:47.890]  which, by the way, and I'm going to throw it out again,
[01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:52.370]  why did you see the murder of a researcher,
[01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:55.090]  a Chinese student killed a Chinese researcher
[01:27:55.090 --> 01:27:58.090]  at, I think it was UNC Chapel Hill, last week?
[01:27:58.090 --> 01:27:59.890]  Why did you see that last week?
[01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:01.850]  The same time we saw University of Pittsburgh
[01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:04.410]  go after a guy who was directly tied to the COVID-19,
[01:28:04.410 --> 01:28:05.890]  another Chinese researcher.
[01:28:05.890 --> 01:28:07.130]  Murder suicide, they call it.
[01:28:07.130 --> 01:28:08.090]  Murder suicide.
[01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:09.010]  I'm going to just leave it there.
[01:28:09.010 --> 01:28:10.090]  I'm going to just leave it there.
[01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:12.170]  Jack, most other people can find you
[01:28:12.170 --> 01:28:15.690]  with your great show every day at humanevents.com.

[01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:17.970]  Amazing interview.
[01:28:17.970 --> 01:28:18.930]  It's hard to get you on.
[01:28:18.930 --> 01:28:19.890]  I know you're a busy man,
[01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:21.010]  so do your wife and family,
[01:28:21.010 --> 01:28:23.530]  and everybody, we love you, brother.
[01:28:23.530 --> 01:28:24.350]  God bless, Alex.
[01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:25.190]  Always appreciate it.
[01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:27.230]  Yeah, humanevents.com will be up in just a couple of minutes.

[01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:30.510]  We're doing the Candace Owens show on Friday.
[01:28:30.510 --> 01:28:33.150]  She has a huge anti-Netflix documentary
[01:28:33.150 --> 01:28:34.910]  that's coming out, Counter-Journalism.
[01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:35.750]  I love it.
[01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:36.590]  Convicting a murderer.
[01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:37.990]  Can't wait to see that on Friday.
[01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:39.590]  Alex, if you're around, we'd love to have you, man.
[01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:40.870]  Have me whenever you want.
[01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:42.550]  My producers will talk to you right now.
[01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:45.230]  Jack Musselby, thank you so much.
[01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:46.070]  All right, we're going to come back
[01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:47.430]  and get into this bio weapon stuff.
[01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:48.270]  Stay with us.
[01:28:48.270 --> 01:29:00.270]  Bodies is back.

[01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:04.590]  has returned to Infowarsstore.com

[01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:15.370]  Hundreds of peer reviewed scientific articles
[01:29:15.370 --> 01:29:17.470]  are published every year on the chemistry
[01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:19.390]  and therapeutic potential of turmeric
[01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:20.990]  and its active components.

[01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:37.230]  contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[01:29:37.230 --> 01:29:40.030]  but our super powerful extract using bodies

[01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:45.230]  No other product can compare

[01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:51.250]  to the test, then look no further.

[01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:10.830]  It's just a bar.
[01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:13.030]  It's just a restaurant.
[01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:14.910]  It's just nursing homes.
[01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:16.790]  It's just schools.

[01:30:20.110 --> 01:30:22.670]  It's just until the cases go down.
[01:30:22.670 --> 01:30:24.910]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:27.750]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.

[01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:38.910]  It's just singing.
[01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:41.630]  It's just travel.
[01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:44.110]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[01:30:44.110 --> 01:30:46.030]  It's just for the greater good.
[01:30:46.030 --> 01:30:49.910]  It's just fact checking, not censorship.
[01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:51.910]  It's just mandatory.
[01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:53.790]  It isn't just at all.

[01:30:58.630 --> 01:31:01.510]  The Infowars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver
[01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:03.150]  has finally returned.

[01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:59.470]  You wanted to plug Rainforce.
[01:31:59.470 --> 01:32:00.470]  Do you like Rainforce?
[01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:02.990]  Yeah, so my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:05.230]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:32:05.230 --> 01:32:07.150]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mankiewicz,
[01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:09.250]  four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:11.550]  and now two books with Alex Jones.
[01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:14.950]  That's because I use Brainforce every day.
[01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:17.230]  What I always need is I always need
[01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:18.990]  some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:32:18.990 --> 01:32:22.150]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well,
[01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:22.990]  take good vitamins,
[01:32:22.990 --> 01:32:25.590]  but the one thing that I have really found
[01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:28.430]  that makes a difference is Brainforce.
[01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:30.750]  I'll take Brainforce in the morning,
[01:32:30.750 --> 01:32:32.590]  right before I go to my computer,
[01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:35.150]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours
[01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:36.150]  writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:37.990]  So it really is true
[01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:40.630]  that Brainforce is something I use every day
[01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:42.270]  and it helps me with my writing.
[01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:43.110]  All right, we love you.
[01:32:43.110 --> 01:32:43.950]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:46.070]  Get your Brainforce Plus, Brainforce Ultra,

[01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:50.350]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[01:32:50.350 --> 01:32:54.350]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:56.350]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:19.309]  The globalists' worst nightmare and the Patriots' best friend, Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.309 --> 01:33:24.790]  Alright, we cover a lot of hardcore stuff here.
[01:33:24.790 --> 01:33:27.470]  We're risking our lives to do it because we know we're all going to get destroyed in
[01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:31.590]  the end and we don't stand up now.
[01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:36.670]  But 16, 17 days ago, I came on air and I said I talked to a high-level whistleblower
[01:33:36.670 --> 01:33:39.830]  and then I made some other calls and confirmed what I was told.
[01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:42.930]  And I said, you're going to see the rollout of the testing and the cancelled concerts
[01:33:42.930 --> 01:33:49.150]  and the schools being closed again and them telling you to wear a mask again.
[01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:50.870]  And it's all there, okay?
[01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:55.030]  And of course, they denied it because they don't want us to say, hey, we don't want
[01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:56.030]  it.
[01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:57.309]  And we go, oh, we're not doing that, we're not doing that.
[01:33:57.309 --> 01:33:59.910]  Nobody's going to ban your gas-powered stoves and they introduce it and now they've
[01:33:59.910 --> 01:34:00.910]  done it.
[01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:03.389]  We're not going to ban your light bulbs, now they've done it.
[01:34:03.389 --> 01:34:07.590]  We're not going to take your cows, now they're doing it all over the Europe.
[01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:13.349]  So my hope was to get enough opposition to it to get them to stop the rollout.
[01:34:13.349 --> 01:34:16.790]  Instead, they're just continuing the rollout and you're like, well, that's incredibly
[01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:17.790]  unpopular.
[01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:18.790]  Well, since when do they care?
[01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:21.150]  So I have stacks of news.
[01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:22.950]  Oh, Metallica cancels a concert.
[01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:24.309]  Oh, first lady tests positive.
[01:34:24.309 --> 01:34:25.870]  Oh, all these other schools shut down.
[01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:33.190]  Oh, these colleges say you've got to have this new booster or you can't go to school.
[01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:36.309]  Now they're trying to make the military take it again when we already beat that once.
[01:34:36.309 --> 01:34:37.309]  It's experimental.
[01:34:37.309 --> 01:34:38.309]  It's illegal.
[01:34:38.309 --> 01:34:42.370]  Yes, under U.S. law, you can make the military, one group, take shots.
[01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:43.370]  It's wrong.
[01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:46.070]  You can't make them take experimentals.
[01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:53.269]  That's a whole other subject, but the globalists are setting the precedent for total control.
[01:34:53.269 --> 01:35:00.830]  So I got up here two and a half weeks ago and I said, for 45 minutes, I wouldn't
[01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:02.750]  tell you what the story was.
[01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:07.230]  And I said, if I make a big deal about this, I told you in 45 minutes, we'll publish an
[01:35:07.230 --> 01:35:08.230]  article.
[01:35:08.230 --> 01:35:10.990]  And if you make it go viral, it'll be the top story.
[01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:14.790]  And then it'll really hurt their rollout, which it has done.
[01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:22.950]  Now if I tell you this next story, which I just want to get to and cover, it's incredible.
[01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:26.230]  It's horrifying.
[01:35:26.230 --> 01:35:33.349]  But if I just get up here and cover this, a couple of million people will see it.
[01:35:33.349 --> 01:35:39.870]  But if you get excited and you tell everybody to tune in and once this is archived, demand
[01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:44.990]  out a video, if you share it like it's an event, because it is, then hundreds of
[01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:47.790]  millions will see it and then we can start beating the enemy.
[01:35:47.790 --> 01:35:50.870]  Because I'm not like the mainstream media that'll say, come on up, shark attack.
[01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:55.130]  And then you watch like a 45 minute into a show and they finally, last segment, show
[01:35:55.130 --> 01:35:56.970]  the shark attack.
[01:35:56.970 --> 01:35:58.309]  That's how you get people to tune in and get to watch.
[01:35:58.309 --> 01:36:00.309]  I don't do tricks.
[01:36:00.309 --> 01:36:03.730]  That's why when I did the trick, I said, okay, I'm doing a trick here.
[01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:07.090]  I'm the type of guy, just top stories, top story, and it's the start of the show
[01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:09.590]  and I tell you whatever is most important.
[01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:11.430]  But it's weird human psychology.
[01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:16.410]  It doesn't have as big an effect, not one tenth as big, if I don't hype it up.
[01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:17.710]  So you know what?
[01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:19.410]  I'm not going to cover it.
[01:36:19.410 --> 01:36:27.370]  I have the most incredible footage, the most incredible documents, the most insane information.
[01:36:27.370 --> 01:36:39.769]  I'm taking it and I'm putting it aside and I'm going to cover it Friday.
[01:36:39.769 --> 01:36:43.389]  And then 200 million will see it instead of 5 million.
[01:36:43.389 --> 01:36:44.389]  That's what victory takes.
[01:36:44.389 --> 01:36:46.570]  That's what victory gets.
[01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:49.410]  But actually it's too dangerous for my life actually to not cover it now.
[01:36:49.410 --> 01:36:55.370]  Oh, this is the type of thing that might just go, you know that son of a bitch.
[01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:58.250]  Say it's a carjacking, kill his ass today.
[01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:59.250]  Roll the team.
[01:36:59.250 --> 01:37:00.809]  And they got a team sitting by right now in Austin.
[01:37:00.809 --> 01:37:01.809]  We know that.
[01:37:01.809 --> 01:37:02.809]  I'm serious.
[01:37:02.809 --> 01:37:07.550]  I mean, because they know this, you, they know you're too powerful when you take action.
[01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:10.710]  They know when you get upset.
[01:37:10.710 --> 01:37:20.150]  They know when you get engaged that it goes mega viral and then we get ahead of the enemy
[01:37:20.150 --> 01:37:21.150]  and we win.
[01:37:21.150 --> 01:37:23.750]  So I'm going to split the baby.
[01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:32.470]  I've got all this other incredible news that I'm going to hit first.
[01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:40.430]  And then in about 50 minutes from now, we come in at the 20 after.
[01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:47.230]  So about 50 minutes from now, I'm going to play you the most insane stuff you've ever
[01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:48.230]  seen.
[01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:54.670]  I mean, I found this yesterday and I already knew a lot about this, but man, I went down
[01:37:54.670 --> 01:37:55.670]  a rabbit hole.
[01:37:55.670 --> 01:38:00.430]  I've done like six, seven hours of research on this.
[01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:08.269]  And I mean, I've watched like five of these Pentagon briefings and you know, you go to
[01:38:08.269 --> 01:38:11.670]  YouTube, they got 5,000 views, 30,000 views.
[01:38:11.670 --> 01:38:13.630]  There's like no comments on it.
[01:38:13.630 --> 01:38:20.710]  No one even cares that the most insane crap, the Pentagon going, well, we're going
[01:38:20.710 --> 01:38:24.910]  to mind control all Americans for their own good and we're going to put chips in
[01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:25.910]  your brains.
[01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:30.630]  And you know, if we don't, the Chinese will mind control you.
[01:38:30.630 --> 01:38:31.630]  That's always the excuse.
[01:38:31.630 --> 01:38:32.630]  That's how evil works.
[01:38:32.630 --> 01:38:38.670]  Well, the unjustifies the means and they go, yeah, we may just have to hit the public
[01:38:38.670 --> 01:38:43.630]  with a weapon of mass disruption to break down society and medicalize them.
[01:38:43.630 --> 01:38:48.210]  So people are so sick, they can't resist us because here at the Pentagon, we have
[01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:53.150]  our interests and they're the American people and you know, we're our own group
[01:38:53.150 --> 01:38:58.349]  and we're just going to go ahead and make them so sick with protein crystals that
[01:38:58.349 --> 01:39:02.510]  they can't even get out of bed because we're going to stop violence because
[01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:05.670]  what you're doing is horrible and evil and you know, we're going to finally
[01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:09.030]  resist having you take our sons and cut their dicks off.
[01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:13.630]  And so the Pentagon's like, well, it's our job to make sure they don't ever resist
[01:39:13.630 --> 01:39:14.630]  that.
[01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:21.710]  So we'll just poison everybody and you get into their sick thinking, their self-appointedness
[01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:24.550]  and that's why they want a full drone military.
[01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:29.309]  That's why drag queen story time and critical race theory and oh, the Gadsden flag,
[01:39:29.309 --> 01:39:33.070]  you know, the Navy can't have that no more, even though it's its original flag.
[01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:37.750]  First flag of the US Navy, Gadsden flag, John Paul Jones, is to get the
[01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:42.710]  good people to quit and then those that don't quit, they implant you with deadly
[01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:45.750]  shots to slowly kill you.
[01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:50.190]  So by means of elimination, you'll only end up having the biggest morons ever
[01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:56.090]  in the military, other than the controllers on top.
[01:39:56.090 --> 01:40:03.670]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:40:03.670 --> 01:40:07.910]  There's so many, you know, this isn't a big enchilada.
[01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:11.150]  This is like 85,000 trays of enchiladas.
[01:40:11.150 --> 01:40:12.150]  Okay.
[01:40:12.150 --> 01:40:14.750]  I mean, I've already cracked the code on this.
[01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:19.290]  I went for like a five mile hike this morning and I re-listened to one of these
[01:40:19.290 --> 01:40:24.610]  hour-long lectures and it was just, not even read between the lines, they were
[01:40:24.610 --> 01:40:27.970]  admitting it all, but if you don't know the words they're using, and I've been
[01:40:27.970 --> 01:40:31.889]  saying this for a long time and I barely could follow it, it's horrible.
[01:40:31.889 --> 01:40:36.610]  I mean, I mean, they are, they are, they are sitting back, you know, head
[01:40:36.610 --> 01:40:43.410]  DARPA director, head neurology department, just, just, I mean, they are just
[01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:51.889]  talking about total destruction of everybody and how, and it's just, it's funny to them.
[01:40:51.889 --> 01:40:52.889]  And I get it.
[01:40:52.889 --> 01:40:58.170]  To one of these guys that's got 170 IQ, but is missing a soul, you see people in
[01:40:58.170 --> 01:41:01.250]  traffic and dumb people at the grocery store and you're just like, let me just kill
[01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:02.250]  all these people.
[01:41:02.250 --> 01:41:06.090]  You know that big old fat woman over there, just kill her ass, you know, cause, cause
[01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:09.010]  if you can't figure this out, they think you deserve to die.
[01:41:09.010 --> 01:41:13.130]  Well here's a little newsflash you guys, my children don't deserve to die and I do.
[01:41:13.130 --> 01:41:16.450]  I am as smart as you and I know what you're doing and I have something you
[01:41:16.450 --> 01:41:17.450]  don't have though.
[01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:22.190]  I got a soul on top of it.
[01:41:22.190 --> 01:41:28.450]  So you want to sit there and play God and do all this stuff and you think
[01:41:28.450 --> 01:41:30.050]  you're so smart.
[01:41:30.050 --> 01:41:32.950]  You do this stuff, it'll destroy the planet.
[01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:35.510]  No one's ever going to get out of this.
[01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:41.050]  If they go much further, any moron that knows history would know this.
[01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:43.050]  So these people are their own worst enemies.
[01:41:43.050 --> 01:41:44.730]  They can't help it.
[01:41:44.730 --> 01:41:47.570]  And you know what's even more insane?
[01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:53.610]  The main working group under DARPA with the US army, do you know what their
[01:41:53.610 --> 01:42:00.370]  organization is called and what they call themselves?
[01:42:00.370 --> 01:42:01.370]  Got a wild guess.
[01:42:01.370 --> 01:42:07.490]  Just like the most horrible global ID bills, whether it's in the EU or the
[01:42:07.490 --> 01:42:13.250]  UN or the US Congress are always 666, just to let you know, the name of
[01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:16.490]  this bill for global government and to buy or sell you got to have
[01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:19.690]  this digital mark 666.
[01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:27.130]  Guess what they call the main Pentagon consortium group between the
[01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:33.110]  different branches of the military that coordinates this stuff.
[01:42:33.110 --> 01:42:39.210]  They call it the mad scientist group.
[01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:46.710]  They call themselves the mad scientists because they are stark raving mad.
[01:42:46.710 --> 01:42:49.269]  Just because you can do something doesn't mean you do it.
[01:42:49.269 --> 01:42:51.870]  We can create a black hole now with fission fusion.
[01:42:51.870 --> 01:42:52.870]  They can do it.
[01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:53.870]  They know how to do it.
[01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:57.110]  Let's just make one destroy the planet because we can make it.
[01:42:57.110 --> 01:42:58.110]  Yeah.
[01:42:58.110 --> 01:43:02.930]  For everything the global has hit us with, God through mother nature has given us the
[01:43:02.930 --> 01:43:03.930]  answer.
[01:43:03.930 --> 01:43:07.730]  I don't have to sell you on CBD oil, full spectrum of CBD oil, the incredible
[01:43:07.730 --> 01:43:11.690]  things it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological
[01:43:11.690 --> 01:43:15.530]  system for your nervous system, particularly everybody knows it's
[01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:16.530]  incredible.
[01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:17.530]  It works.
[01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:20.730]  We have the strongest, best CBD oil you're going to find anywhere at the
[01:43:20.730 --> 01:43:21.730]  lowest price.
[01:43:21.730 --> 01:43:27.290]  Yes, you can find this same CBD oil for 30% more because that's who we're
[01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:31.130]  getting it from made right here in central Texas.

[01:43:34.769 --> 01:43:40.250]  Rebels Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country
[01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:43.250]  that's based right here in Texas and we're giving it to you at 30% off.
[01:43:43.250 --> 01:43:47.030]  Here's what's even crazier, 30% off of what they're selling it for.
[01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:50.370]  They're selling theirs for 30% off what their competitors are.
[01:43:50.370 --> 01:43:54.570]  This is the highest rated, already the lowest price, not even a lower price.

[01:43:58.370 --> 01:44:03.650]  A lot of people have asked me, why is mfullworthstore and mfullworthlife not in a probiotic for more

[01:44:59.809 --> 01:45:05.250]  I want to thank Alex Jones and Infowars for offering scholarships to River University.
[01:45:05.250 --> 01:45:10.809]  Maybe you're watching Infowars today and you don't know what to do with the problems
[01:45:10.809 --> 01:45:12.889]  that we faced in the world today.
[01:45:12.889 --> 01:45:19.410]  You've been through COVID-19, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023, but here at River University,
[01:45:19.410 --> 01:45:24.410]  not only do we show you what the problem is, but we show you how to deal with it.

[01:46:04.330 --> 01:46:08.570]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not
[01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:14.010]  get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[01:46:14.010 --> 01:46:18.570]  But now we've got it 30 parts per million from the top lab, we've got a limited

[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.540]  We are running some old friends.
[01:47:24.540 --> 01:47:25.540]  Is she alright?
[01:47:25.540 --> 01:47:26.540]  Seems okay if we can get to it.
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:35.540]  If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could possibly imagine.

[01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:32.540]  So, coming up in about 45 minutes or less, 40 minutes, I'm going to take you to the DARPA command center,
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:40.540]  where they're openly talking about hitting you with weapons to make you sick so you can't resist them with soft kill.
[01:48:41.540 --> 01:48:50.540]  And they talk specifically about protein prion replicating nanotech in 2017.
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:53.540]  And that's just one of the clips.
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:55.540]  Oh, it gets a lot worse.
[01:48:55.540 --> 01:49:08.540]  And again, Max Planck, 130 years ago, theoretically envisioned the equations for the atomic bomb.
[01:49:08.540 --> 01:49:11.540]  They had equations by the 30s for the hydrogen bomb.
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:17.540]  So, they didn't make those to the 50s or the big ones, they called them, the super.
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:24.540]  They had equations in the 60s for creating strangelets and artificial black holes,
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:34.540]  but they didn't have the fission-fusion reactors like you saw China and Japan do in public the last few years.
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:37.540]  The United States in the 80s did it.
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:41.540]  I remember my dad one Saturday was very excited PBS was going to have it.
[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:43.540]  He literally had popcorn out.
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:45.540]  And so his buddies came over.
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:47.540]  And there it was on PBS.
[01:49:47.540 --> 01:49:52.540]  They created an artificial sun inside this warehouse facility the Pentagon did.
[01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:58.540]  And they thought, well, there's less than a 10% chance it will explode and blow the U.S. off the map.
[01:49:58.540 --> 01:50:02.540]  There's maybe a half a percent that it will create a black hole and destroy the earth.
[01:50:02.540 --> 01:50:07.540]  But they still did it, just like Operation Fishbowl.
[01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:12.540]  Look up Operation Fishbowl in the early 1960s.
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:20.540]  Hundreds of hydrogen bombs detonated in the upper atmosphere to see if they could ignite the planet's atmosphere.
[01:50:20.540 --> 01:50:25.540]  And blow holes in the Van Allen radiation belt.
[01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:33.540]  So the reason I raise all that is the nanotech, the ray-specific weapons, all the things they're creating,
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:37.540]  they go, well, because we can create it, we must create it.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:40.540]  And if we create it, we must use it.
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:49.540]  Like General Jack T. Ripper and Dr. Strangelove based on Curtis LeMay, a composite of Curtis LeMay and L.L. Lemitzer.
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:55.540]  In the 1980s, they had that great movie, Spies Like Us, that's kind of a ripoff of that.
[01:50:55.540 --> 01:51:06.540]  But a good ripoff, great comedy, where at the end, the U.S. government, a rogue group is sending these spies.
[01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:08.540]  They all get captured or killed.
[01:51:08.540 --> 01:51:13.540]  So the decoy idiots actually get in and launch the ICBM at the U.S.
[01:51:13.540 --> 01:51:17.540]  so that the Pentagon can go ahead and have an excuse for nuclear war.
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:23.540]  And the head general saying, our studies show that an unused weapon is a useless weapon.
[01:51:23.540 --> 01:51:25.540]  These were real statements.
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.540]  That was back when Hollywood didn't want nuclear war.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:32.540]  Now they love it. Sean Penn loves it. It's fun.
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:38.540]  So, guys type in China creates artificial sun and they launch it at the beach.
[01:51:38.540 --> 01:51:41.540]  This big sun just goes up, gets bigger and bigger, and then dissipates.
[01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:42.540]  Could have kept growing.
[01:51:43.540 --> 01:51:44.540]  That was on the news like a year ago.
[01:51:44.540 --> 01:51:47.540]  They said, oh, this is a big, giant, artificial sun China just launched.
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:50.540]  YouTube it, guys. China launches its artificial sun.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:53.540]  Well, there's a chance it might just keep expanding and burn the whole planet up.
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:54.540]  Let's just go ahead and do it.
[01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:58.540]  Oh, there's a chance we fire hydrogen bombs in the atmosphere and ignite it and kill everybody.
[01:51:58.540 --> 01:52:00.540]  Let's just do it.
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:06.540]  Oh, there's a chance that Hadron superconducting supercollider is going to create a black hole and kill everybody.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:09.540]  Or a whole bunch of other little nasty things.
[01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.540]  Like a strange look that's another type of black hole.
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:17.540]  It's like a mass triggering implosion of matter.
[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:19.540]  And that's just who I am.
[01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:24.540]  I'm sitting here going, you know, I could, just for no reason, I would never do this.
[01:52:24.540 --> 01:52:29.540]  Just like, you know, I could go over and kill my neighbors and hang them up with that chain and eat them.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:32.540]  When the last time I said that years ago and it went viral.
[01:52:32.590 --> 01:52:41.030]  The media spun and said, oh Jones, really, you know, absolutely wants to kill his neighbors.
[01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:46.790]  No, I said, you collapse civilization, that's the type of world that you bring us into.
[01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:48.910]  Yeah, yeah, fast forward to the actual sun they launched.
[01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:49.910]  Here it is.
[01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:53.310]  Oh, here, let's just, we're not going to launch rockets, let's create an artificial
[01:52:53.310 --> 01:52:57.850]  sun and just launch it in the atmosphere.
[01:52:57.850 --> 01:53:03.070]  So they can create stuff trillions of times more dangerous than that.
[01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:05.070]  And they're doing it.
[01:53:05.070 --> 01:53:09.130]  You know, at least the quote US government did it in an underground bunker under a mountain
[01:53:09.130 --> 01:53:19.050]  a mile under stone in a warehouse with giant energy field compressors to try to hold the
[01:53:19.050 --> 01:53:22.650]  sun in control so that it wouldn't expand.
[01:53:22.650 --> 01:53:24.410]  And it was still very dangerous.
[01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:28.950]  The Chinese were like, oh, the communists were like, here, let's just go to the beach
[01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:32.210]  and create one, just launch it and see what it does.
[01:53:32.210 --> 01:53:37.730]  And again, it gets enough gas, just like, you know, gasoline fire or something.
[01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:40.150]  You ever put too much lighter fluid on something and it blows up and burns your
[01:53:40.150 --> 01:53:41.150]  hair off?
[01:53:41.150 --> 01:53:47.890]  Well, just imagine the mindset of these gremlin people, these mad scientists everywhere that
[01:53:47.890 --> 01:53:51.850]  call themselves mad scientists.
[01:53:51.850 --> 01:53:52.850]  There it is.
[01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:57.770]  China's artificial sun breaks record, making latest milestone in quest for efficient thermonuclear
[01:53:57.770 --> 01:54:00.690]  fusion reactors.
[01:54:00.690 --> 01:54:05.530]  And I always love how the media is like, China cloned humans for the first time.
[01:54:05.530 --> 01:54:08.130]  China created fission fusion for the first time.
[01:54:08.130 --> 01:54:09.650]  China created the first.
[01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:11.290]  No, they didn't.
[01:54:11.290 --> 01:54:17.730]  The United States did it all 30, 40 years ahead of everyone else.
[01:54:17.730 --> 01:54:27.250]  And then the crazy people at Los Alamos laboratory in 1949 gave the Russians how to do it.
[01:54:27.250 --> 01:54:30.870]  I mean, look, if you're going to make something this deadly, how about you not hand
[01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:38.050]  it out to people, but their argument is, well, if they can blow us up and we can
[01:54:38.050 --> 01:54:42.010]  blow them up, then nobody will do it.
[01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:43.010]  Yeah.
[01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:44.010]  Yeah, right.
[01:54:44.010 --> 01:54:49.630]  But then meanwhile, you're constantly testing it, admitting it will statistically at some
[01:54:49.630 --> 01:54:51.630]  point get out of control.
[01:54:51.630 --> 01:54:55.150]  This is beyond playing with fire.
[01:54:55.150 --> 01:54:58.390]  This is the definition of satanic lunacy.
[01:54:58.390 --> 01:55:01.470]  And I'm not against progress.
[01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:05.670]  In the future, if some big corporation or group or some religious group who can raise
[01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:11.910]  the money wants to like go off in a big orbiting space station that has gravity,
[01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:18.850]  and you want to fly off, you know, to 20 light years away and do this, you go do it.
[01:55:18.850 --> 01:55:22.850]  But we should have our own government here on the earth to tell anybody you do any of
[01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:27.130]  this stuff here, we're going to blow your ass out of the air.
[01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:31.610]  You do anything like this in the solar system, you're, and you know what the argument
[01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:32.610]  is?
[01:55:32.610 --> 01:55:36.890]  Well, then somebody also launched the level two civilization, and they'll go out, you
[01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:40.990]  know, 10 light years or five light years out, and they'll build the weapons and come
[01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:43.610]  back and conquer us.
[01:55:43.610 --> 01:55:49.830]  We're already conquered by our own insanity making all of this stuff.
[01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:50.830]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[01:55:50.830 --> 01:55:54.730]  I mean, weather modification has been around for 100 years.
[01:55:54.730 --> 01:55:59.510]  It's been declassified, they're chemtrailing, manipulating the weather at the adult table.
[01:55:59.510 --> 01:56:02.010]  But for kids, they go, Oh, kids, it doesn't exist.
[01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:05.930]  Just like all this nanotech and the stuff I'm going to cover next hour that they've
[01:56:05.930 --> 01:56:10.090]  released us and they explain why they're doing it.
[01:56:10.190 --> 01:56:17.310]  But they don't respect you because the general public goes, well, laser beams are movies.
[01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:19.630]  We don't have those.
[01:56:19.630 --> 01:56:22.190]  And they just have no idea.
[01:56:22.190 --> 01:56:23.190]  We're going to break.
[01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:24.190]  I've done two hours.
[01:56:24.190 --> 01:56:25.190]  Now that plug.
[01:56:25.190 --> 01:56:26.190]  If I don't plug, we won't be here.
[01:56:26.190 --> 01:56:27.190]  I'm our biggest problem.
[01:56:27.190 --> 01:56:28.190]  The listeners are great.

[01:56:32.190 --> 01:56:33.190]  But I'll get on Jags and not plug for the whole show.
[01:56:33.190 --> 01:56:35.390]  And then no funds come in and then we're going to shut down.
[01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:37.950]  But that's not why you need the products.
[01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:38.950]  That's part of it.

[01:58:23.570 --> 01:58:27.650]  This is 95%.
[01:58:27.650 --> 01:58:28.650]  Super constant.

[01:59:02.730 --> 01:59:03.730]  it.
[01:59:03.730 --> 01:59:08.690]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega threes.
[01:59:08.690 --> 01:59:14.370]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[02:00:04.310 --> 02:00:09.590]  As Chris Gleason reporting for the Gateway Pundit reported, a bombshell investigation
[02:00:09.590 --> 02:00:15.990]  has uncovered jaw dropping connections between Fannie Willis and a sprawling web of election
[02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:18.950]  fraud and money laundering activities.
[02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:24.650]  You know, she's raised 92 percent of her funding out of 44 states outside of Georgia
[02:00:24.650 --> 02:00:28.450]  and only 8 percent came out of that local area.
[02:00:28.450 --> 02:00:30.010]  So that tells you what's going on.
[02:00:30.010 --> 02:00:36.450]  The investigation, which spans across multiple states and multiple jurisdictions, has revealed
[02:00:36.450 --> 02:00:43.090]  a complex network of illicit operations aimed at undermining the very foundation of our
[02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:46.130]  constitutional republic and the rule of law.
[02:00:46.130 --> 02:00:53.230]  The first local elected official identified as part of this ongoing money laundering operation
[02:00:53.230 --> 02:00:55.930]  was New York DA Alvin Bragg.
[02:00:55.930 --> 02:01:01.390]  We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct.
[02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:06.150]  Exposed by James O'Keefe and his people at O'Keefe Media Group, Alvin Bragg received
[02:01:06.150 --> 02:01:11.510]  massive numbers of campaign finance contributions from this network of individuals who had
[02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:13.670]  been identified as Smurfs.
[02:01:13.670 --> 02:01:18.450]  FEC data shows that some senior citizens across the U.S. have been donating thousands
[02:01:18.450 --> 02:01:19.810]  of times per year.
[02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:22.250]  You did donate to AtBlue, right?
[02:01:22.250 --> 02:01:25.530]  Yes, once in a while, yes.
[02:01:25.530 --> 02:01:27.530]  What about $18,850?
[02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:29.530]  I doubt that.
[02:01:29.530 --> 02:01:37.290]  18,672 different contributions that total an amount of $170,000 and 221 cents.
[02:01:37.290 --> 02:01:40.150]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:01:40.150 --> 02:01:45.490]  The investigation into Alvin Bragg also helped to uncover the use of prepaid credit
[02:01:45.490 --> 02:01:51.130]  and debit cards in the structuring of the campaign finance contributions and the payment
[02:01:51.130 --> 02:01:53.830]  to ballot-harvesting mules.
[02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:59.530]  Illicit campaign finance funds were also identified in the campaigns of the Wisconsin
[02:01:59.530 --> 02:02:05.610]  Supreme Court race of Janet Protasowitz and Senator Ralph Warnock, and spread to states
[02:02:05.610 --> 02:02:11.270]  such as Missouri, Maryland, Wisconsin, Arizona, and then into every single state in the United
[02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:12.270]  States.
[02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:19.670]  We have videotape of Jackie Amos going into boxes, bringing in thumb drives, bringing
[02:02:19.670 --> 02:02:24.130]  in ballots to be inserted into machines.
[02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:31.470]  This is the opportunity to stop corruption and to stop fraud when it comes to elections
[02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:32.910]  in the state of Mississippi.
[02:02:32.910 --> 02:02:38.530]  This is what Fannie Willis and the Democrats have created in Atlanta, boarded up in abandoned
[02:02:38.530 --> 02:02:42.090]  homes everywhere, crack houses for blocks and blocks.
[02:02:42.090 --> 02:02:49.770]  Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, another inmate died in custody.
[02:02:49.770 --> 02:02:53.850]  Five inmates in the last month, all black.
[02:02:53.850 --> 02:02:54.850]  Why?
[02:02:54.850 --> 02:02:56.330]  Now, let me see here.
[02:02:56.330 --> 02:03:02.130]  You got a black mayor, you got a black prosecutor, you got a black sheriff, and black people
[02:03:02.130 --> 02:03:05.230]  are dying at the jail.
[02:03:05.230 --> 02:03:06.750]  Where's Al Sharpton?
[02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:08.910]  Where's Kamala Harris?
[02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:11.270]  Where's Joe Biden?
[02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:12.270]  Nowhere to be found.
[02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:13.470]  Where's Black Lives Matter?
[02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:17.630]  My father is a former and I guess always a black panther.
[02:03:17.630 --> 02:03:20.950]  I take a lot of pride in being black in America.
[02:03:20.950 --> 02:03:26.950]  Do you think that you were personally singled out by Fannie Willis and others to set an
[02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:27.950]  example?
[02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:28.950]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:30.990]  She wanted to send a message to black folks.
[02:03:30.990 --> 02:03:36.130]  You know, there's a huge trend amongst African American men leaning towards President
[02:03:36.130 --> 02:03:40.730]  Trump and looking more into conservatism and, you know, they definitely don't want
[02:03:40.730 --> 02:03:41.730]  that.
[02:03:41.730 --> 02:03:44.730]  Some say he's racist and tweets like a kid, while overlooking all the good sh-t
[02:03:44.730 --> 02:03:45.730]  that he did.
[02:03:45.730 --> 02:03:46.730]  I am ashamed of my president a little bit.
[02:03:46.730 --> 02:03:54.730]  I'd rather have an alpha male than a little bitch.
[02:03:55.070 --> 02:04:04.550]  It was recently discovered that 222 contributions to Atlanta DA Fannie Willis' campaign had zero
[02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:09.950]  donor information, while one of the out-of-state Fannie Willis campaign contributors had made
[02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:17.270]  over 9,178 individual contributions just at the federal level since 2018.
[02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:23.030]  Meanwhile, this nationwide money laundering Rico enterprise is making more and more contributions
[02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:28.370]  to PACs, and these PACs in turn are financing local candidates.
[02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:34.210]  This Rico operation is at the heart of the Democrat Party's ability to retain power,
[02:04:34.210 --> 02:04:41.090]  a full-fledged organized crime operation with strong ties to a myriad of Soros-connected
[02:04:41.090 --> 02:04:47.270]  organizations, operating within a one-world government agenda framework to destroy the
[02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:53.730]  United States, now delivered on a silver platter to an unwilling Congress ushering in its
[02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:55.690]  own demise.
[02:04:55.690 --> 02:04:58.770]  John Baum reporting.
[02:04:58.770 --> 02:05:00.330]  It's just a mask.
[02:05:00.330 --> 02:05:02.150]  It's just six feet.
[02:05:02.150 --> 02:05:04.690]  It's just non-essential businesses.
[02:05:04.690 --> 02:05:07.130]  It's just non-essential workers.
[02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:09.670]  It's just until we work it out.
[02:05:09.670 --> 02:05:11.210]  It's just a bar.
[02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:13.370]  It's just a restaurant.
[02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:15.290]  It's just nursing homes.
[02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:17.090]  It's just schools.
[02:05:17.090 --> 02:05:20.350]  It's just to keep from overwhelming medical services.
[02:05:20.350 --> 02:05:22.910]  It's just until the cases go down.
[02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:25.150]  It's just to flatten the curve.
[02:05:25.150 --> 02:05:27.990]  It's just to keep others feeling safe.
[02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:30.470]  It's just for a few more weeks.
[02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:35.030]  It's just gyms, salons, spas, and sporting events.
[02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:37.470]  It's just churches and mosques.
[02:05:37.470 --> 02:05:39.150]  It's just singing.
[02:05:39.150 --> 02:05:41.870]  It's just travel.
[02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:44.350]  It's just until we get a vaccine.
[02:05:44.350 --> 02:05:46.230]  It's just for the greater good.
[02:05:46.250 --> 02:05:50.170]  It's just fact checking, not censorship.
[02:05:50.170 --> 02:05:52.170]  It's just mandatory.
[02:05:52.170 --> 02:05:54.090]  It isn't just at all.
[02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:57.730]  Visit defendjones.com to help fight back today.
[02:05:59.890 --> 02:06:03.970]  Get ready.
[02:06:06.050 --> 02:06:09.330]  Lockdown 310 is here.
[02:06:09.330 --> 02:06:19.430]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:25.590]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:25.590 --> 02:06:28.190]  All right.
[02:06:28.190 --> 02:06:33.510]  I got a lot of big breaking news to cover here before we get into the wildest stuff ever.
[02:06:33.510 --> 02:06:36.710]  Coming up here in about 15, 20 minutes.
[02:06:36.710 --> 02:06:37.790]  I'm going to do it at the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:38.530 --> 02:06:44.490]  So everybody you know, please go to infowars.com and please share the links because we're about
[02:06:44.490 --> 02:06:49.730]  to make some really big announcements and some big news here.
[02:06:49.730 --> 02:06:52.050]  And again, dog doesn't hunt without you.
[02:06:52.050 --> 02:06:53.050]  You're not the tail.
[02:06:53.050 --> 02:06:54.490]  You're the whole dog and the tail.
[02:06:54.490 --> 02:06:59.130]  You're the tip of the nose, the ears, the eyes, it's back and shoulders, it's front
[02:06:59.130 --> 02:07:04.050]  legs, it's chest, it's back and stomach, it's back legs, it's tail.
[02:07:04.050 --> 02:07:07.550]  From the tip of the tail to the tip of the nose.
[02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:08.550]  You're everything.
[02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:10.910]  I just don't know how to explain that to you when you call in and thank me.
[02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:12.110]  I want to beat these people.
[02:07:12.110 --> 02:07:13.270]  Thank you for tuning in.
[02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:15.110]  We're all in the same boat here.
[02:07:15.110 --> 02:07:16.930]  All right.
[02:07:16.930 --> 02:07:17.930]  And I'm not against being thanked.
[02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:19.430]  It was, oh, I know you hate being thanked.
[02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:21.910]  No, it's ass backwards.
[02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:22.910]  We're all in this fight together.
[02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:24.590]  I want to thank you.
[02:07:24.590 --> 02:07:26.190]  I'm the one asking you for money.
[02:07:26.190 --> 02:07:27.670]  I'm the one asking you for prayer.
[02:07:27.670 --> 02:07:31.990]  I'm the one asking you to spread the word because I know I'm right, folks.
[02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:39.030]  I knew when I got up here, 16, 17 days ago, and I said, they're bringing lockdowns back.
[02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:42.950]  I didn't just believe somebody I've known for a long time that's high level TSA.
[02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:43.950]  I made other phone calls.
[02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:44.950]  They said, yeah, how'd you know that?
[02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:45.950]  We just got told yesterday.
[02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:52.190]  It's coming back mid September, new shots, new mask and lockdowns, the public events
[02:07:52.190 --> 02:07:57.110]  being closed, all of it, and it's here, everywhere.
[02:07:57.110 --> 02:07:58.710]  They're canceling concerts all over.
[02:07:58.710 --> 02:08:00.350]  They're closing public schools.
[02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:01.870]  They're demanding more shots.
[02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:06.310]  They're telling New Yorkers, you know, this weekend wear a mask.
[02:08:06.310 --> 02:08:08.370]  But they came out and said, oh, Alex Jones is wrong.
[02:08:08.370 --> 02:08:09.550]  The White House says he's wrong.
[02:08:09.550 --> 02:08:11.230]  Oh, the CDC says he's wrong.
[02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:12.710]  The NIH says he's wrong.
[02:08:12.710 --> 02:08:15.510]  Oh, the TSA says he, nobody said that.
[02:08:15.510 --> 02:08:19.030]  We're not bringing anything back because they didn't want us to hit them and point out
[02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:24.870]  was BS before they did the fear campaign to try to get the sheeple to do it without
[02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:25.870]  having to debate.
[02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:27.270]  And they're like, oh, look, there's mask everywhere.
[02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:28.910]  See, it's real.
[02:08:29.630 --> 02:08:30.630]  Well, guess what?
[02:08:30.630 --> 02:08:39.110]  I just got a hand during the break.
[02:08:39.110 --> 02:08:48.830]  The gaslighting queen, Ms. Pierre, says Biden will be wearing masks indoors again.
[02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:54.950]  We'll play the club at the moment, but it's the sire.
[02:08:54.990 --> 02:09:00.110]  Through the corporations, through the colleges, through the power structure, through the hotels,
[02:09:00.110 --> 02:09:03.990]  through the Uber, they're all being told, wear your mask again.
[02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:09.230]  And they are so angry that we got the jump on them and could get our people moving to
[02:09:09.230 --> 02:09:14.050]  say, hell no, they'd rather just slip it back in again.
[02:09:14.050 --> 02:09:16.130]  And then a lot of like, oh, Jones, I'll never do that.
[02:09:16.130 --> 02:09:22.230]  It's so unpopular in your conservative populist bubble where you're around same people tuned
[02:09:22.230 --> 02:09:25.990]  in the same shows, you know, that sounds ridiculous.
[02:09:25.990 --> 02:09:31.870]  Well, so does them teaching millions of kids to sign up to be put on puberty blockers
[02:09:31.870 --> 02:09:36.070]  or hundreds of thousands to have their penises cut off.
[02:09:36.070 --> 02:09:39.790]  They're a cult, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:39.790 --> 02:09:40.790]  So yeah.
[02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:49.370]  And, you know, I wish we formed enough opposition, like I said, 16, 17 days ago to have them
[02:09:49.370 --> 02:09:50.370]  just back off.
[02:09:50.410 --> 02:09:53.130]  And I said, you know, this is what will happen.
[02:09:53.130 --> 02:09:55.450]  It'll form our opposition, we'll beat it.
[02:09:55.450 --> 02:09:57.610]  They won't get it all done because of this.
[02:09:57.610 --> 02:09:59.250]  But I said, they're not going to stop.
[02:09:59.250 --> 02:10:00.750]  They've been given their orders.
[02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:02.250]  They got their new booster rolling out.
[02:10:02.250 --> 02:10:05.430]  They want to poison more people.
[02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:07.690]  And I said, I believe they're still going to do it.
[02:10:07.690 --> 02:10:09.050]  And then what's going to happen?
[02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:12.530]  Credibility of the show goes straight up again.
[02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:19.930]  See, only way I'd lose would be not telling you the truth.
[02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:23.370]  I knew full well when I came out and said that it was true.
[02:10:23.370 --> 02:10:26.770]  And I knew full well they were still going to do it.
[02:10:26.770 --> 02:10:32.130]  But now they're going to have to do the mind control from Germany to Canada, the
[02:10:32.130 --> 02:10:33.130]  US to Australia.
[02:10:33.130 --> 02:10:34.970]  It's the same script, UN.
[02:10:34.970 --> 02:10:36.810]  Nobody ever locked you down.
[02:10:36.810 --> 02:10:39.330]  Nobody ever made you take a shot.
[02:10:39.330 --> 02:10:41.370]  And nobody ever said the shots work.
[02:10:41.370 --> 02:10:45.230]  In fact, if you had the old shots, it makes you get sicker.
[02:10:45.230 --> 02:10:46.950]  So you need this new shot.
[02:10:46.950 --> 02:10:49.090]  The CDC said Friday.
[02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:50.650]  I got that article.
[02:10:50.650 --> 02:10:52.770]  How big of a whopper is that?
[02:10:52.770 --> 02:10:53.970]  Did you just hear what I said?
[02:10:53.970 --> 02:10:55.130]  I'll show you the article.
[02:10:55.130 --> 02:10:56.810]  Hell, it's all in the news.
[02:10:56.810 --> 02:10:58.130]  You don't need to be hiding under a rock.
[02:10:58.130 --> 02:11:00.050]  You know about it.
[02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:04.530]  People that have been previously vaccinated for COVID-19 are at more of a risk for
[02:11:04.530 --> 02:11:05.330]  the new variant.
[02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:06.050]  Wow.
[02:11:06.050 --> 02:11:07.090]  We already knew that.
[02:11:07.090 --> 02:11:09.970]  But what world is this?
[02:11:09.970 --> 02:11:13.970]  They're using the fact that the last shot erased your immune system to claim
[02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:15.970]  this new one's going to make it better.
[02:11:15.970 --> 02:11:22.170]  Talk about gaslighting, like Pierre last week.
[02:11:22.170 --> 02:11:26.930]  Biden did the most incredible response to Maui ever and did a perfect job.
[02:11:26.930 --> 02:11:34.370]  Do you need me to tell you that's the biggest load of horsemen I've ever seen?
[02:11:34.370 --> 02:11:42.330]  So the good news is, as long as you resist them, they fail.
[02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:44.450]  But if we just sat here and went, oh, I don't know.
[02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:45.690]  I don't know if they're going to do it.
[02:11:45.690 --> 02:11:47.530]  I don't know if Alex tells me the truth.
[02:11:47.530 --> 02:11:48.770]  I mean, who knows?
[02:11:48.770 --> 02:11:53.810]  As if I get up here and make a prediction that wasn't based on intel.
[02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:55.330]  I want to be tomorrow's news today.
[02:11:55.330 --> 02:11:56.730]  I want to be right.
[02:11:56.730 --> 02:11:58.210]  I want to beat them.
[02:11:58.210 --> 02:12:01.090]  I don't like them.
[02:12:01.090 --> 02:12:02.890]  Truth makes you win.
[02:12:02.890 --> 02:12:05.690]  Lies make you fail.
[02:12:05.690 --> 02:12:09.930]  Now, I've made mistakes and I've been given bad intel before, but very rarely.
[02:12:09.930 --> 02:12:12.290]  And even the stuff I thought was bad intel, now that I've been through a
[02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:13.850]  bunch of stuff, you know what I'm talking about?
[02:12:13.850 --> 02:12:22.690]  Now, I'm like, actually, once I experienced the CIA attacks and the whole thing, I'm like,
[02:12:22.690 --> 02:12:27.530]  wow, they really got some big balls, man.
[02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:31.650]  Like, Jussie Smollett got in trouble because he went and staged something
[02:12:31.650 --> 02:12:32.490]  without the full backing.
[02:12:32.490 --> 02:12:36.530]  They're like, hey, son, you don't go do freelance false flags.
[02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:38.210]  You do them with us.
[02:12:38.210 --> 02:12:39.330]  Let's do that.
[02:12:39.330 --> 02:12:42.010]  That's it.
[02:12:42.010 --> 02:12:50.690]  So colleges, public schools shut down, masking, hospitals demanding mask,
[02:12:50.690 --> 02:12:54.410]  demanding you take a new shot.
[02:12:54.410 --> 02:12:55.810]  Yeah, they're going to do it all.
[02:12:55.810 --> 02:12:57.810]  They're going to start in mid-September.
[02:12:57.810 --> 02:13:00.610]  We're not even there yet.
[02:13:00.610 --> 02:13:05.450]  We're 10 days away from when I told you this was going to begin.
[02:13:05.450 --> 02:13:07.490]  And you see the buildup.
[02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:08.850]  And you know, they can't help it.
[02:13:08.850 --> 02:13:13.130]  I told you, September 15th, they'll announce the new shot.
[02:13:13.130 --> 02:13:20.210]  A week and a half later, she gets up there and says, on September 15th, they start the new shot.
[02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:24.450]  Because I got briefed by the feds that we're in the meetings.
[02:13:24.450 --> 02:13:27.250]  Precise, like shooting a missile.
[02:13:27.250 --> 02:13:29.530]  It's an analogy, down somebody's chimney.
[02:13:29.530 --> 02:13:35.370]  Precision guided, folks.
[02:13:35.370 --> 02:13:37.650]  Now, can we admit they're trying it and say no?
[02:13:37.650 --> 02:13:42.690]  Or we have to keep debating whether they're trying it or not.
[02:13:42.690 --> 02:13:43.770]  I'll use a gross analogy.
[02:13:43.770 --> 02:13:51.490]  It's like if your next door neighbor five years ago, for no reason, just tackled your wife in the front yard and raped her.
[02:13:51.490 --> 02:13:53.210]  And then witnesses see it.
[02:13:53.210 --> 02:13:55.650]  The neighbor goes on trial, gets five years in prison.
[02:13:55.650 --> 02:13:58.170]  And then the son of a bitch moves back in next door.
[02:13:58.170 --> 02:14:01.650]  Let's say his wife still lives there.
[02:14:01.650 --> 02:14:04.810]  And then he says, I'm going to rape your wife again.
[02:14:04.810 --> 02:14:09.130]  And then you're sitting there when she walks out of the car and you're sitting there in your front room drinking coffee.
[02:14:09.130 --> 02:14:17.330]  And you see the neighbor run over and tackle your wife again and pull his genitals out and put her legs back and punch her in the face.
[02:14:17.330 --> 02:14:19.650]  You're like, he's raping my wife again.
[02:14:19.650 --> 02:14:23.410]  Do you need him to get it done to know what's happening?
[02:14:23.410 --> 02:14:26.370]  Joe Biden has tackled the American people again.
[02:14:26.370 --> 02:14:28.010]  He's pulled down his pants.
[02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:32.090]  He's got an erect penis sticking out.
[02:14:32.090 --> 02:14:34.690]  And it's trying to mount us again.
[02:14:34.690 --> 02:14:36.530]  Do we have to have him do it to go?
[02:14:36.530 --> 02:14:38.290]  Well, he's got an erection.
[02:14:38.290 --> 02:14:39.730]  He punched my wife in the face.
[02:14:39.730 --> 02:14:41.650]  He's got her legs back behind her ears.
[02:14:41.650 --> 02:14:42.890]  I'm sorry about the gross analogy.
[02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:45.170]  This is because they're about to rape us with shots, folks.
[02:14:45.170 --> 02:14:55.290]  They're about to rape us with our kids having to wear a mask again and do all the same biological medical rape.
[02:14:55.290 --> 02:14:58.130]  I mean, that's the set of them.
[02:14:58.130 --> 02:14:59.730]  It'd be better if it was just that, right?
[02:14:59.730 --> 02:15:05.490]  No, they got their shots with their prions and their heart attack causing poison ready to rape us again.
[02:15:05.490 --> 02:15:06.570]  They got the shots out.
[02:15:06.570 --> 02:15:07.530]  They got a new one.
[02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:08.650]  They were on their mask.
[02:15:08.650 --> 02:15:09.850]  They're locking stuff down.
[02:15:09.850 --> 02:15:11.290]  They're canceling concerts.
[02:15:11.290 --> 02:15:14.370]  They're shutting down schools and they're shutting down football games.
[02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:18.530]  And they got the needle out again in their hand.
[02:15:18.530 --> 02:15:22.050]  It's not Joe Biden's rotting pecker that's hanging out.
[02:15:22.050 --> 02:15:29.370]  It's a big old poisonous shot.
[02:15:29.410 --> 02:15:30.690]  I got to control myself.
[02:15:30.690 --> 02:15:31.370]  I'm so mad right now.
[02:15:31.370 --> 02:15:37.410]  I'm sorry for being a little gross here, but I'm trying to get you in the mindset of rape here because this is raping your rights.
[02:15:37.410 --> 02:15:40.170]  And they got a huge UN treaty to take over all your freedoms.
[02:15:40.170 --> 02:15:41.970]  I got a giant stack on that.
[02:15:41.970 --> 02:15:43.410]  ADL quarterbacking it.
[02:15:43.410 --> 02:15:45.210]  I mean, it's just insane.
[02:15:45.210 --> 02:15:46.730]  They're rapists.
[02:15:46.730 --> 02:15:47.730]  They want to own us.
[02:15:47.730 --> 02:15:49.010]  They want to run us.
[02:15:49.010 --> 02:15:50.850]  They want to control us.
[02:15:50.850 --> 02:15:57.610]  How much of this are we going to put up with, people?
[02:15:57.650 --> 02:16:04.530]  Coffee has not been available at infowarsetour.com for two years because the price went up too high and the quality was starting to go down.
[02:16:04.530 --> 02:16:08.770]  I turned out so many other producers that wanted to partner with us.
[02:16:08.770 --> 02:16:13.010]  But when the folks at Minuteman came to me a year ago and I began to try their coffees, I was blown away.
[02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:18.450]  We finally have three great coffees that are the best they have to offer available to you right now.
[02:16:18.450 --> 02:16:20.730]  This is the best coffee I've ever tasted.
[02:16:20.730 --> 02:16:24.530]  It smells amazing and it's some of the strongest coffee I've ever drank.
[02:16:24.530 --> 02:16:32.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, these three single-source Colombian coffees are now available at infowarsetour.com exclusively.
[02:16:32.090 --> 02:16:34.490]  Escape the Prison Planet Light Roast.
[02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:35.330]  Tastes great.
[02:16:35.330 --> 02:16:37.450]  It's the strong one, really strong.
[02:16:37.450 --> 02:16:39.130]  But these are all close second and thirds.
[02:16:39.130 --> 02:16:41.930]  Medium Roast, Wake of America, whoo!
[02:16:41.930 --> 02:16:43.290]  That's what my go-to.
[02:16:43.290 --> 02:16:49.010]  Dark Roast, Tip of the Spirit, tastes the best and is amazing and is still very, very strong, gives you that pep.
[02:16:49.010 --> 02:16:53.050]  They're all three available at infowarsetour.com and they fund our operation.
[02:16:53.050 --> 02:16:56.170]  And each order gets a pocket Constitution Citizen Rollbook.
[02:16:57.250 --> 02:17:02.130]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[02:18:18.530 --> 02:18:20.050]  We haven't had it in stock for years.

[02:19:03.090 --> 02:19:12.650]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.

[02:19:55.810 --> 02:20:08.850]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:08.850 --> 02:20:15.689]  On March 6th, 2001, Alex Jones first predicted the September 11th attack on the World Trade
[02:20:15.689 --> 02:20:16.689]  Center.
[02:20:16.689 --> 02:20:23.050]  You've got an element of the FBI and these war game scenarios where they can remote control
[02:20:23.050 --> 02:20:26.810]  a 747 and they're going to crash it into the World Trade Center.
[02:20:26.810 --> 02:20:32.130]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now, Infowars tells you the truth
[02:20:32.130 --> 02:20:34.090]  about what's happening next.
[02:20:34.090 --> 02:20:52.330]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:20:52.330 --> 02:20:59.090]  I love this music from like 50 years ago, the graphic cartoon of Beowulf.
[02:20:59.090 --> 02:21:08.130]  I think this energy signifies our energy, relentless against the storm, with the storm, rowing into
[02:21:08.130 --> 02:21:09.130]  it.
[02:21:09.130 --> 02:21:10.130]  Yes, yes.
[02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:11.130]  Throw more of me, I'm getting stronger.
[02:21:11.130 --> 02:21:24.890]  You'll kill a lot of us in the end, you'll fall.
[02:21:24.890 --> 02:21:32.689]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:21:32.689 --> 02:21:36.970]  Well the sick Machiavellian part of me, it was like 5% of me and it's a little
[02:21:36.970 --> 02:21:40.050]  dabble and I'm like shut up and stop it all the time.
[02:21:40.050 --> 02:21:45.529]  I mean it's there though and it's like and when you come out and tell them there's
[02:21:45.529 --> 02:21:49.369]  a new lockdown coming, the globalists aren't going to stop and you'll be proven right
[02:21:49.369 --> 02:21:50.369]  again.
[02:21:50.369 --> 02:21:55.890]  I'm like shut up, I want to stop it.
[02:21:55.890 --> 02:22:00.609]  But throw me in the briar patch, they're going to do the whole thing and again they
[02:22:00.609 --> 02:22:04.890]  lose credibility, we gain credibility and it just gets worse for them by the minute
[02:22:04.890 --> 02:22:07.090]  because we don't give up.
[02:22:07.090 --> 02:22:12.449]  Yeah they harass our families, yeah they harass us, yeah they put us through hell,
[02:22:12.449 --> 02:22:17.010]  but you know what, I like it.
[02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:21.650]  I didn't ask for it, I'm not a sadist, but I kind of am now.
[02:22:21.650 --> 02:22:28.570]  You see, if they make you stare into the abyss so long, it's Nietzschean.
[02:22:28.570 --> 02:22:34.730]  What did Donna Brazile say over the weekend, I played her on the Sunday show.
[02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:38.109]  She said there's never been a movement this powerful in modern American history, everything
[02:22:38.109 --> 02:22:40.769]  we do only makes you stronger, we're in deep trouble.
[02:22:40.769 --> 02:22:44.170]  She's literally going eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.
[02:22:44.170 --> 02:22:45.170]  That's right.
[02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:46.170]  Alarm.
[02:22:46.170 --> 02:22:52.410]  It's exactly, you're piles of garbage.
[02:22:52.410 --> 02:22:55.449]  We're done being your slaves.
[02:22:55.449 --> 02:23:02.130]  And that's why I play that Nanzig song, we'll play it coming in the next segment.
[02:23:02.130 --> 02:23:09.810]  If you want to bang heads with me, I'll show you what it's like till you're bleeding.
[02:23:09.810 --> 02:23:11.609]  And I'll be bleeding too.
[02:23:11.609 --> 02:23:14.289]  But you just seem to not know when to back off.
[02:23:14.289 --> 02:23:16.449]  I don't want to run your life, New World Order.
[02:23:16.449 --> 02:23:20.869]  I don't want to be in control of you, you clowns.
[02:23:20.869 --> 02:23:23.930]  But you want to run my life, don't you?
[02:23:23.930 --> 02:23:24.490]  Show.
[02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:34.320]  If you want to find hell with me, I can show you what it's like.
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:40.680]  If you want to bang heads with me, till you all bleed in, then that's the way it is.
[02:23:40.680 --> 02:23:46.199]  We didn't ask for the fight, we didn't look for the fight, but we're way more intelligent
[02:23:46.199 --> 02:23:47.199]  than the globalists.
[02:23:47.199 --> 02:23:49.859]  We just don't want power because we're confident.
[02:23:49.859 --> 02:23:50.859]  You're happy.
[02:23:50.859 --> 02:23:52.760]  You're happy with your life and what you're doing.
[02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:54.080]  You just want to be a normal person.
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.560]  You don't want to run people's life.
[02:23:55.560 --> 02:24:01.519]  You got your own life, but see, that's because you're not a degenerate.
[02:24:01.519 --> 02:24:07.480]  But I'll tell you this, if you don't recognize this scum for what they are and start opposing
[02:24:07.480 --> 02:24:10.859]  them, you're worse than they are.
[02:24:10.859 --> 02:24:15.400]  And that's all I ask people to do, is to not roll over to this scum.
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:17.500]  Isn't that easy to ask for?
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:18.840]  And yeah, they're going to come after you.
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:22.400]  They're coming after you anyway.
[02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:25.039]  Why not give them what they're looking for?
[02:24:25.039 --> 02:24:26.160]  They want to bang heads.
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:28.840]  I banged heads plenty for real.
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:35.160]  And almost everybody starts crying for mommy real fast because when you're ready to break
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:43.480]  your bones on them, they've never run into somebody that doesn't have a governor.
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:46.640]  And it's those of us that are good that do have governors.
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:48.359]  We understand our dark side.
[02:24:48.359 --> 02:24:51.160]  We're trying to be good people, but you know what?
[02:24:51.160 --> 02:24:52.920]  These aren't good people we're up against.
[02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:59.300]  So stop laying down and living on your knees and at least let these bastards know verbally
[02:24:59.300 --> 02:25:01.880]  you're not submitting to them.
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:08.160]  And then in every way, in every day, you pull out your support from them.
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:18.100]  Now we got, this news we've got is so dizzyingly insane and so documented and so evil
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:28.580]  and so ridiculous that I just, I just, I just can't do it justice and I want to do it justice.
[02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:39.160]  I don't even, it's something this, I mean, I've got five hours of Pentagon lectures
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:43.699]  at the head of DARPA, the head of universities, the head of federal programs, the head of
[02:25:43.699 --> 02:25:49.939]  air force programs, the head of army programs, just literally saying the most evil crap you've
[02:25:49.939 --> 02:25:50.939]  ever heard.
[02:25:50.939 --> 02:25:54.580]  And the problem is if I even try to like play this, I would sit there and listen
[02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:55.939]  to it like an hour up this morning.
[02:25:55.939 --> 02:25:58.980]  I was like, I was like, I'll be stopping the tape every five seconds.
[02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:09.060]  I mean, the admissions and what they're really saying is just insanely evil, but it is what
[02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:14.619]  it is because I'm here trying to tell you about trillions of dollars of mind control
[02:26:14.619 --> 02:26:18.100]  funding on a radio show, TV show.
[02:26:18.100 --> 02:26:20.380]  I'm trying to give you the real depth of it.
[02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:29.420]  And my brain can barely even grasp the industrial giant gargantuan behemoth colossus level
[02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:30.980]  of this.
[02:26:30.980 --> 02:26:33.580]  And I mean, and it's such a conviction.
[02:26:33.580 --> 02:26:35.600]  It's such a slam dunk.
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:38.000]  It's so horrible.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.519]  And then it ties into everything else they've done.
[02:26:40.519 --> 02:26:42.920]  And then you're just like, what the hell?
[02:26:42.920 --> 02:26:48.439]  I mean, do these people, do they realize what they've done?
[02:26:48.439 --> 02:26:53.359]  And the answer is no, they got a bunch of old, powerful, rich families that want
[02:26:53.359 --> 02:26:54.359]  to live forever.
[02:26:54.359 --> 02:26:58.960]  And they even admit that they go, when we create these biological crises, out of that
[02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:02.560]  will come incredible new technologies for us to basically live forever.
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:06.760]  And we can put a simple small chip in your brain, it's declassified right now, where
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:11.320]  you can see full spectrum and all the radiation in the universe.
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:13.840]  And it's going to be a great augmentation for the public.
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:25.400]  And it just goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:32.119]  But I'll take my first look at it when we come back.
[02:27:32.119 --> 02:27:36.560]  Right now I mentioned it, so let's just go ahead and play this clown.
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:43.519]  The press secretary, Biden will be wearing a mask indoors again.
[02:27:43.519 --> 02:27:47.680]  Ten days before I told you they were all at the new shot, before they announced that,
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:49.480]  did I not deliver?
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:50.480]  All glory to God.
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:55.600]  I mean, the people that question me, like, I mean, anything I say, I think's the truth.
[02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:58.920]  I'm wrong sometimes, but rarely, but let me tell you something, there's something coming
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:27:59.920]  out of this mouth.
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:02.840]  Who gets up here and says horrible things about themselves?
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:06.039]  Horrible thing, I have aborted babies, I've killed my children because I need to be totally
[02:28:06.039 --> 02:28:07.039]  truthful with you.
[02:28:07.039 --> 02:28:08.039]  I'm repenting of that.
[02:28:08.039 --> 02:28:13.519]  The point is, if I'm telling you something, I absolutely believe it and I'm right 95%
[02:28:13.519 --> 02:28:14.519]  of the time.
[02:28:14.519 --> 02:28:19.480]  Do you understand on my soul, on my children, on the souls of my grandchildren, I hope
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:21.439]  to have.
[02:28:21.439 --> 02:28:23.980]  These people are out to destroy you and your family.
[02:28:23.980 --> 02:28:27.480]  They think they're God and somebody's got to call them on it.
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:31.080]  Go to the clap.
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:36.519]  President Biden tested negative last night for COVID-19 and tested negative again today.
[02:28:36.519 --> 02:28:41.279]  He's not experiencing any symptoms as far as the steps that he is taking.
[02:28:41.279 --> 02:28:45.760]  Since the president was with the first lady yesterday, he will be masking while indoors
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:49.779]  and around people in alignment with CDC guidance.
[02:28:49.779 --> 02:28:54.800]  And as has been the practice in the past, the president will remove his mask when
[02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:57.119]  Sufficiently distance from others.
[02:28:57.119 --> 02:28:58.800]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:28:58.800 --> 02:28:59.800]  Thought it was next week.
[02:28:59.800 --> 02:29:00.800]  I come in this morning.
[02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:04.260]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[02:29:04.260 --> 02:29:06.359]  Body's ultimate term reformula.
[02:29:06.359 --> 02:29:10.240]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:12.119]  Overhead shot please.
[02:29:12.119 --> 02:29:16.359]  Look how full this bottle is.
[02:29:16.359 --> 02:29:19.400]  Right to the top, folks.
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:25.199]  Right to the top with these 95% humanoids.
[02:29:25.199 --> 02:29:29.240]  Again most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:32.000]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:36.080]  This is 95%.
[02:29:36.080 --> 02:29:37.080]  Super constant.
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:38.080]  It's like taking one pill.
[02:29:38.080 --> 02:29:40.720]  It's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:41.720]  It's that powerful.
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:42.720]  Or more.
[02:29:42.720 --> 02:29:47.039]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:30:57.240 --> 02:31:01.340]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality
[02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:05.359]  coffee has not been available, and that's because the prices went up too high for
[02:31:05.359 --> 02:31:07.760]  the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:13.000]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us, but now we have brought
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:19.100]  back the coffee, and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned
[02:31:19.100 --> 02:31:20.519]  and veteran operated.
[02:31:20.519 --> 02:31:23.760]  It's powered by the company, Minuteman Coffee.

[02:31:57.320 --> 02:32:01.560]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:03.760]  5G or the GMO crops.
[02:32:03.760 --> 02:32:08.599]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and
[02:32:08.599 --> 02:32:10.140]  industry to use.
[02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:13.480]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:17.119]  The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply
[02:32:17.119 --> 02:32:22.720]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:23.880]  Look it up.
[02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:25.099]  Don't let them do this to your family.

[02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:56.439]  You need this filter.
[02:32:56.860 --> 02:33:08.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.860 --> 02:33:13.760]  On March 20th, 2003, the United States invaded Iraq.
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:18.860]  Exactly one year before the invasion, Alex Jones predicted it.
[02:33:18.860 --> 02:33:21.860]  So now everybody's going, wow, it really was the Iraqis.
[02:33:21.860 --> 02:33:23.860]  That's just because they're getting ready to invade Iraq.
[02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:25.860]  What a beautiful setup.
[02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:28.860]  While other networks lie to you about what's happening now,
[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:32.860]  InfoWars tells you the truth about what's happening next.
[02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:37.860]  Visit infowars.com forward slash show and share the link today.
[02:33:55.860 --> 02:33:58.860]  Alex!
[02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:12.860]  Kill y'all bleeding!
[02:34:25.860 --> 02:34:29.860]  Fly!
[02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:39.860]  Our species is destined to be the stars of the odd.
[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:45.860]  This is our great test before we graduate to a point one civilization.
[02:34:45.860 --> 02:34:50.860]  I want to put my full will into the people of Earth.
[02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:52.860]  We are an extension of our ancestors,
[02:34:52.860 --> 02:34:55.860]  and now their strength is shining through.
[02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:03.860]  I want to be a capacitor just like you need to be.
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:05.860]  Bring God's will into the universe
[02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:09.860]  and do the incredible things we are destined to do together.
[02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:11.860]  Woo!
[02:35:22.860 --> 02:35:24.860]  Woo!
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:40.860]  All right, we are live Tuesday, September 5th, 2023.
[02:35:40.860 --> 02:35:43.860]  I'll be hosting some of the next hour before Maria Zetec's over.
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:46.860]  And I am fired up!
[02:35:53.860 --> 02:35:55.860]  All right, we kind of hit that break hard.
[02:35:55.860 --> 02:35:58.860]  I didn't get to play all the clip, and I want to play it again.
[02:35:58.860 --> 02:36:01.860]  Once, without stopping it.
[02:36:01.860 --> 02:36:03.860]  Then I want to play it again, stopping it,
[02:36:03.860 --> 02:36:07.860]  because they tell you everything in this clip.
[02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:11.860]  She says,
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:15.860]  We're going back to the usual protocol.
[02:36:17.860 --> 02:36:20.860]  We're the White House press secretary.
[02:36:21.860 --> 02:36:28.860]  We're going back to the usual that we did in the last three and a half years.
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:30.860]  The White House press secretary just said,
[02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:32.860]  It's no big deal.
[02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:34.860]  Don't form an opposition.
[02:36:34.860 --> 02:36:36.860]  Don't say no.
[02:36:36.860 --> 02:36:39.860]  We're just going back to little kids wearing masks
[02:36:39.860 --> 02:36:42.860]  and placing shots and stores locked down
[02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:48.860]  and vaccine passports like the California state website announced last week.
[02:36:49.860 --> 02:36:51.860]  While they gaslight and say,
[02:36:51.860 --> 02:36:54.860]  Oh, you didn't like what happened in the last three and a half years?
[02:36:54.860 --> 02:36:56.860]  It's not happening.
[02:36:56.860 --> 02:37:00.860]  We're just going back to the standard we did before.
[02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:02.860]  Say it again.
[02:37:02.860 --> 02:37:06.860]  New lockdowns, new cover controls aren't happening.
[02:37:08.860 --> 02:37:12.860]  We're just going back to the way it was before
[02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:15.860]  the last time we did this.
[02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:17.860]  Let that sink in.
[02:37:17.860 --> 02:37:19.860]  No, no.
[02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:22.860]  All the big federal, TSA, White House,
[02:37:22.860 --> 02:37:25.860]  AP Reuters, Alex Jones is a liar.
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:27.860]  Nobody's coming out with a new shot.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:29.860]  Nobody's coming out with masks.
[02:37:29.860 --> 02:37:32.860]  Nobody's coming back the way it was.
[02:37:34.860 --> 02:37:36.860]  No.
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:38.860]  That's ridiculous.
[02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:41.860]  We're just going back to the way it was.
[02:37:44.860 --> 02:37:46.860]  We're not going back the way it was.
[02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:48.860]  We're going back the way it was.
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:51.860]  We're not going back to the way it was.
[02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:53.860]  We're just going back the way it was.
[02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:55.860]  You understand?
[02:37:55.860 --> 02:37:58.860]  We're not going back to the way it was.
[02:37:58.860 --> 02:38:00.860]  My earpiece fell out here.
[02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:03.860]  We're not going back the way it was.
[02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:05.860]  We're going back the way it was.
[02:38:05.860 --> 02:38:08.860]  I can say that Trump had a great comment with Tucker
[02:38:08.860 --> 02:38:10.860]  in an interview he did a few weeks ago.
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:13.860]  He goes, Man, you got to love the Vice President Kamala Harris.
[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:16.860]  The way she says things like, the bus is a bus,
[02:38:16.860 --> 02:38:18.860]  so the bus does what a bus does,
[02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:21.860]  so it is a bus because after all, you know it's a bus.
[02:38:21.860 --> 02:38:23.860]  That's almost as crazy as,
[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:26.860]  come on, we're not going back the way it was.
[02:38:26.860 --> 02:38:28.860]  We're just going back the way it was.
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:30.860]  Well, glad you told me.
[02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:32.860]  Thank you very much for that.
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:35.860]  Don't listen to the conspiracy theorists, though.
[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:39.860]  So go ahead and roll Raggedy in here.
[02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:42.860]  President Biden tested negative last night for COVID-19
[02:38:42.860 --> 02:38:44.860]  and tested negative again today.
[02:38:44.860 --> 02:38:47.860]  He's not experiencing any symptoms.
[02:38:47.860 --> 02:38:49.860]  As far as the steps he is taking
[02:38:49.860 --> 02:38:52.860]  since the President was with the First Lady yesterday,
[02:38:52.860 --> 02:38:55.860]  he will be masking while indoors and around people
[02:38:55.860 --> 02:38:58.860]  in alignment with CDC guidance.
[02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:01.860]  And as has been the practice in the past,
[02:39:01.860 --> 02:39:03.860]  the President will remove his mask
[02:39:03.860 --> 02:39:06.860]  when sufficiently distanced from others indoors
[02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:08.860]  and while outside as well.
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:12.860]  As he has done it in the past,
[02:39:12.860 --> 02:39:15.860]  we will follow the past thingy.
[02:39:17.860 --> 02:39:19.860]  It's so ridiculous.
[02:39:19.860 --> 02:39:21.860]  It's so crazy.
[02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:27.860]  You know, I had like big national talk shows
[02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:29.860]  call me up like two weeks ago.
[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:31.860]  They go, Alex, this is a really big story.
[02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:33.860]  No one believes they're going to break lockdowns.
[02:39:33.860 --> 02:39:35.860]  Now, you really have a source.
[02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:37.860]  I'm like, no, I just come on the air
[02:39:37.860 --> 02:39:38.860]  and say stuff I just, you know,
[02:39:38.860 --> 02:39:39.860]  yeah, I just make it up.
[02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:40.860]  Yeah, right.
[02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:44.860]  And I was like, do you not already see him doing it?
[02:39:44.860 --> 02:39:45.860]  Well, I actually am seeing that.
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:48.860]  Yeah, I'm not making it up.
[02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:50.860]  You know, punch you in the nose.
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:54.860]  I mean, I didn't enjoy what we just went through.
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:56.860]  And at least most of us didn't die here.
[02:39:56.860 --> 02:39:58.860]  Suicide, a lot of old folks getting killed.
[02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:01.860]  But nothing compared to the third world
[02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:04.860]  that just enjoyed
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:07.860]  mass death, 80 plus million star deaths.
[02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:08.860]  You know, those are real numbers.
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:09.860]  Look it up.
[02:40:10.860 --> 02:40:12.860]  So I am beyond pissed right now.
[02:40:12.860 --> 02:40:15.860]  I am just in redonkula world.
[02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:22.860]  But, you know, again, the talking point,
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:23.860]  I meant to play this last week.
[02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:25.860]  I had the clubs together.
[02:40:25.860 --> 02:40:26.860]  I think I had them Sunday too.
[02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:28.860]  Can you guys go back to Sunday or Friday's clubs?
[02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:31.860]  And I had a bunch of compilations
[02:40:32.860 --> 02:40:35.860]  from Australia to the US.
[02:40:35.860 --> 02:40:36.860]  Again, it's the same.
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:37.860]  That's key.
[02:40:37.860 --> 02:40:38.860]  People go, why do you keep saying it
[02:40:38.860 --> 02:40:39.860]  from Australia to the US,
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:41.860]  from New Zealand to Canada?
[02:40:41.860 --> 02:40:44.860]  Because it's global from the UN.
[02:40:44.860 --> 02:40:45.860]  They got a UN treaty.
[02:40:45.860 --> 02:40:46.860]  I got it right here.
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:53.860]  And it's all unified BS.
[02:40:55.860 --> 02:40:57.860]  And I've got the UN treaty.
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:40:58.860]  I keep trying to get to the ADL
[02:40:58.860 --> 02:41:00.860]  because they're heavily involved in it.
[02:41:00.860 --> 02:41:01.860]  I mean, I don't just have this stack here.
[02:41:01.860 --> 02:41:03.860]  It's like, oh, look, he's got a big stack.
[02:41:03.860 --> 02:41:04.860]  He's really informed.
[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:05.860]  This is a prop up here.
[02:41:05.860 --> 02:41:08.860]  Every one of these articles is totally insane.
[02:41:08.860 --> 02:41:09.860]  Just like this over here.
[02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:11.860]  I've got this entire stack
[02:41:11.860 --> 02:41:13.860]  of the most insane satanic garbage
[02:41:13.860 --> 02:41:14.860]  you've ever seen.
[02:41:15.860 --> 02:41:16.860]  And I guess I got to control myself
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:17.860]  and get to it now.
[02:41:17.860 --> 02:41:19.860]  The truth is I'm exhausted.
[02:41:19.860 --> 02:41:21.860]  I'm so sick of looking at the head of the ADL.
[02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:23.860]  I'm so sick of looking at Biden.
[02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:25.860]  I'm so sick of these clubs.
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:27.860]  I'm so sick of these criminals.
[02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:28.860]  I'm so sick.
[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:29.860]  I'm sick.
[02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:31.860]  I don't want to look at them.
[02:41:31.860 --> 02:41:32.860]  You know, when you really hate somebody,
[02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:33.860]  you don't want to think about them.
[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:34.860]  You know what I mean?
[02:41:34.860 --> 02:41:37.860]  Indifference is the greatest form of resistance,
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:39.860]  except when they're the ruling class
[02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:41.860]  raping the daylights out of your patootie.
[02:41:47.860 --> 02:41:48.860]  I know a lot of people
[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:50.860]  tuned in to hear this news.
[02:41:53.860 --> 02:41:54.860]  And I'm not doing this to build it up.
[02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:57.860]  I don't know if I can give this justice right now.
[02:41:58.860 --> 02:42:00.860]  Because I'm beyond angry.
[02:42:00.860 --> 02:42:03.860]  I just, I can't even do the show anymore.
[02:42:08.860 --> 02:42:09.860]  You know, I saw a meme,
[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:11.860]  and I'm not saying do this,
[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:13.860]  but I meant to show it on Sunday's show,
[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:14.860]  and I didn't.
[02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:15.860]  Maybe you guys could dig through the stuff I sent you,
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:17.860]  but I sent these poor people, like,
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:20.860]  hundreds of things a day to print and get.
[02:42:20.860 --> 02:42:21.860]  They almost get me everything,
[02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:22.860]  but sometimes they forget.
[02:42:22.860 --> 02:42:24.860]  But they printed it, and I didn't cover it Sunday.
[02:42:24.860 --> 02:42:26.860]  And it was a woman with a cup of tea,
[02:42:26.860 --> 02:42:27.860]  or a cup of coffee.
[02:42:27.860 --> 02:42:28.860]  You know, cup.
[02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:29.860]  And she says,
[02:42:29.860 --> 02:42:30.860]  they're doing it again
[02:42:30.860 --> 02:42:32.860]  because you didn't hang them last time.
[02:42:32.860 --> 02:42:34.860]  And you know, I looked at that for a long time,
[02:42:34.860 --> 02:42:35.860]  Sunday,
[02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:36.860]  when I sent it,
[02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:37.860]  and I was just like,
[02:42:37.860 --> 02:42:38.860]  you know,
[02:42:38.860 --> 02:42:39.860]  I don't want to hang these people
[02:42:39.860 --> 02:42:41.860]  because they'll turn into a civil war,
[02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:43.860]  and the public's not awake yet to fully do that.
[02:42:43.860 --> 02:42:44.860]  We went to Nuremberg trials,
[02:42:44.860 --> 02:42:45.860]  and then,
[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:46.860]  I mean, I'm not a violent person.
[02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:47.860]  I'm not an addictive person,
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:49.860]  but we do need to hang a bunch of these people
[02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:50.860]  that created a weapon,
[02:42:50.860 --> 02:42:51.860]  gained a function,
[02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:52.860]  released it,
[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:53.860]  blocked therapeutics,
[02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:54.860]  did all this.
[02:42:54.860 --> 02:42:55.860]  Yeah, they need to die.
[02:42:55.860 --> 02:42:56.860]  Okay?
[02:42:56.860 --> 02:43:00.860]  We need to do it by taking the system back
[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:02.860]  because we don't turn them into victims.
[02:43:02.860 --> 02:43:03.860]  Right now, they're losing politically.
[02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:07.860]  They're losing culturally.
[02:43:07.860 --> 02:43:10.860]  And that's some of the clips I've got from the Pentagon
[02:43:10.860 --> 02:43:12.860]  where they're just up there calmly.
[02:43:12.860 --> 02:43:15.860]  Go ahead and go to the break.
[02:43:15.860 --> 02:43:16.860]  I'm not going to skip this break.
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:18.860]  I need to take a few minutes off
[02:43:18.860 --> 02:43:20.860]  to decide whether I'm going to even do this.
[02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:21.860]  Because again,
[02:43:21.860 --> 02:43:22.860]  I'm not building this up,
[02:43:22.860 --> 02:43:23.860]  though I said I was.
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:24.860]  I mean, I need to build things up,
[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:25.860]  but it's not the reason
[02:43:25.860 --> 02:43:27.860]  I'm not covering it right now.
[02:43:27.860 --> 02:43:31.860]  This stuff is so horrible and so insane.
[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:33.860]  And each clip of what they're admitting
[02:43:33.860 --> 02:43:36.860]  and each document is so bombshell,
[02:43:36.860 --> 02:43:38.860]  it'd be like in Raiders of the Lost Ark,
[02:43:38.860 --> 02:43:39.860]  they show up to find the Ark of the Covenant,
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:41.860]  and they find like 50 of them.
[02:43:41.860 --> 02:43:42.860]  You see what I mean?
[02:43:42.860 --> 02:43:45.860]  It's like almost weird
[02:43:45.860 --> 02:43:47.860]  to be on air talking about this.
[02:43:47.860 --> 02:43:49.860]  Like this stuff's so crazy.
[02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:52.860]  They've incrementally got us in this position.
[02:43:52.860 --> 02:43:54.860]  It's just hard to even believe this is real.
[02:43:54.860 --> 02:43:56.860]  I mean, it's so nuts
[02:43:56.860 --> 02:43:58.860]  that they're bringing back all the controls
[02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:00.860]  while saying they're not doing it,
[02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:03.860]  and they've got the Pentagon running around
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:05.860]  creating all these horrible bioweapons
[02:44:05.860 --> 02:44:06.860]  and bragging and saying,
[02:44:06.860 --> 02:44:10.860]  well, we may use it against the American people
[02:44:10.860 --> 02:44:11.860]  so that we make them so sick
[02:44:11.860 --> 02:44:14.860]  they can't stand up to us.
[02:44:14.860 --> 02:44:16.860]  And that's the attitude.
[02:44:17.340 --> 02:44:23.100]  Of the ivy league scum that have hijacked this country, they're like, well they're fighting
[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:28.020]  us and they're not doing well, we'll just create a vaccine regimen with a spike protein protein
[02:44:28.020 --> 02:44:32.700]  crystal and then we'll just send poison shots to all the red areas, sure it'll kill some
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:37.860]  democrats in the area but it'll kill them, yeah they'll never know what we did, it's
[02:44:37.860 --> 02:44:40.220]  so cool man.
[02:44:40.220 --> 02:44:44.460]  They just murdered 20 million people and it's all funny to them and it's just like what
[02:44:44.460 --> 02:44:46.460]  the hell?
[02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:50.220]  And you're sitting here watching them murder everybody and you're supposed to sit on
[02:44:50.220 --> 02:44:55.460]  there and talk about it and then in all their law fare and lawsuits they go, why don't
[02:44:55.460 --> 02:44:56.460]  you care?
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:57.460]  Why aren't you upset?
[02:44:57.460 --> 02:45:00.100]  And it's like, they're going to kill all of you too?
[02:45:00.100 --> 02:45:01.100]  What the hell?
[02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:08.020]  I mean it's like literally watching someone cry over spilt milk while your house is burning
[02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:09.020]  down.
[02:45:09.020 --> 02:45:16.220]  It's like you run out of your house and you trip over a six pack of coca cola in
[02:45:16.220 --> 02:45:19.940]  one can bust while your house is burning with your kids in it and the fire department
[02:45:19.940 --> 02:45:24.060]  gets there and you're like, got a coca cola can and you're like, I lost the coca
[02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:28.180]  cola and you're crying and the fire department goes, your kids all just died in the
[02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:31.760]  fire and you're like, I don't care, I lost the coca cola.
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:34.980]  It's kind of like that, it's just like what?
[02:45:34.980 --> 02:45:40.740]  And then you're kind of like, well maybe we should just kill everybody starting with
[02:45:40.740 --> 02:45:45.980]  the people that are doing it all and I'm not saying do that, but I am kind of like
[02:45:45.980 --> 02:45:50.940]  saying well, just should God just go ahead and blow it up before we let him capture
[02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:51.940]  and torture all the kids?
[02:45:51.940 --> 02:45:53.060]  I'm not saying do that.
[02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:56.900]  Last time I said that Jones wants God to blow the earth up.
[02:45:56.900 --> 02:46:00.620]  It's an intellectual discussion.
[02:46:00.620 --> 02:46:05.720]  No, God shouldn't blow it all, but I don't want to blow it all up.
[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:11.340]  We should change it and we should stop it and we should do something about it.
[02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:15.620]  So millions are tuned in right now and they're saying, what is the big news?
[02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:18.340]  Do you really even want to know?
[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:20.460]  Because I just cover it, no one's going to care.
[02:46:20.460 --> 02:46:24.500]  But if I sit here for three or four days and build it up, I can get more clips and
[02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:28.860]  do more research and be more focused and do a better job and then it's a big national
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:31.820]  story and a big world story and then we hurt them.
[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:35.580]  And what I'm saying there is the moral of the story is this.
[02:46:35.580 --> 02:46:38.540]  We have to take ourselves more serious.
[02:46:38.540 --> 02:46:39.540]  We have been right.
[02:46:39.540 --> 02:46:40.540]  You have been right.
[02:46:40.540 --> 02:46:43.100]  Back in this broadcast, you've been correct.
[02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:46.060]  We've been the folks that were truthful.
[02:46:46.060 --> 02:46:49.260]  We're running out of conspiracy theories, they all came true.
[02:46:49.260 --> 02:46:52.780]  And so I wouldn't have a swagger.
[02:46:52.780 --> 02:46:58.100]  I wouldn't be arrogant or full of bravada or chutzpah or hubris.
[02:46:58.100 --> 02:47:05.500]  And hubris and chutzpah are the same thing.
[02:47:05.500 --> 02:47:10.140]  But I would be aggressive and I would be knowing you're confident you're in the right.
[02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:14.060]  And I think that's the attitude you got to have with all these globalists and all
[02:47:14.060 --> 02:47:18.540]  their minions and people is this time when they're wearing the mask, this time they're
[02:47:18.540 --> 02:47:22.220]  locking the schools down, this time don't put up with their crap, this time they're
[02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:23.660]  blocking therapeutics.
[02:47:23.660 --> 02:47:25.780]  Because here's the big secret.
[02:47:25.780 --> 02:47:30.580]  These injections create the mutations of prions.
[02:47:30.580 --> 02:47:32.080]  These are not regular viruses.
[02:47:32.080 --> 02:47:38.500]  They turn the people that take the shots into giant shedding engines, they're bombs.
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:42.180]  And they admit that depending on the report I've got right here.
[02:47:42.180 --> 02:47:44.180]  From five years ago.
[02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:48.540]  They're going to inject you with a prion creation system and make everybody sick and
[02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:51.020]  no one's going to know and they're going to say it's a virus and it's going to make
[02:47:51.020 --> 02:47:54.380]  the whole country sick so you're so sick you can't resist.
[02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:57.580]  And then the government that hit you with the weapon is going to pose as the savior
[02:47:57.580 --> 02:48:06.160]  and then I have the Pentagon bragging about it.
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:07.160]  And why not?
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:08.160]  They're mad scientists.
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:09.980]  They talk to behavioral psychologists.
[02:48:09.980 --> 02:48:13.980]  They war game it with the Rockefellers and Bill Gates and they go, let's hit these
[02:48:13.980 --> 02:48:14.980]  bastards.
[02:48:14.980 --> 02:48:16.200]  They don't want to turn their guns in.
[02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:18.020]  They don't want to cut their son's dicks off.
[02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:19.540]  They don't want to worship world government.
[02:48:19.540 --> 02:48:23.420]  They don't want to have drag queen pitot time, hit them with a bio weapon and we'll
[02:48:23.420 --> 02:48:28.620]  have our leftist minions be the bombs that take the shots and then slough all this
[02:48:28.620 --> 02:48:34.060]  off on us and it's all cute and funny to them.
[02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:35.980]  Now what I just said is not rhetoric.
[02:48:35.980 --> 02:48:38.620]  What I said is what they're doing.
[02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:45.740]  How am I supposed to sit here and act normal on air and talk about this like I'm talking
[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:49.500]  about the price of tea in China?
[02:48:49.500 --> 02:49:03.860]  You know what I'm kind of doing before I cover this, I'm putting like 5,000 exclamation
[02:49:03.860 --> 02:49:04.860]  points out behind it.
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:13.180]  I'm taking a big old yellow highlighter and I'm saying this is important.
[02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:15.220]  This is big.
[02:49:15.220 --> 02:49:20.280]  Top neuro-ethics professor, the head of the program at Georgetown University raises alarm
[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:26.920]  on how the release of nanoparticles can cause stroke epidemics, but he doesn't really
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:30.860]  do that.
[02:49:30.860 --> 02:49:40.640]  You can cause him, you can say he's raising the alarm.
[02:49:40.640 --> 02:49:44.040]  That's like calling the fire department after you douse your house in gasoline and reporting
[02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:52.520]  it.
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:53.520]  You know what?
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:59.440]  I'm not somebody that doesn't deliver, so I won't give it justice and I'm going
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:04.160]  to spend a lot of the week on it, do special reports, I'm going to do it all, but just
[02:50:04.160 --> 02:50:09.520]  air a promo, air something and I'm going to go splash some water on my face and then
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:12.640]  I'm going to come back and I'll do like 15 minutes the next hour and hit some
[02:50:12.640 --> 02:50:17.980]  of those, but I don't know if people are going to know what they're listening to
[02:50:17.980 --> 02:50:21.160]  and I don't mean that because you're a bad person, you're not smart.
[02:50:21.160 --> 02:50:25.880]  I've been immersed in this for 35 years, immersed, I've been on here 29.
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:32.640]  Hell, I've been immersed in it longer than that and when you know what they're
[02:50:32.640 --> 02:50:38.560]  talking about because you know the lingo, it's horrific and they're little scientists
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:43.160]  laughing and giggling on a power trip because they're playing with hand grenades.
[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:49.480]  They're like monkeys playing with hand grenades and that's really all I can describe
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:55.640]  it as and there's evil powerful groups that have unlimited funding to do all this
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:51:00.580]  and so they're doing it and we sit here while they talk about these Pentagon videos
[02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:06.080]  and of course we're gene editing viruses to make them more powerful, totally illegal,
[02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:10.600]  death penalty, just sitting there doing it and then they lie in front of Congress
[02:51:10.600 --> 02:51:13.880]  while they have all these conferences admitted and we sit there and watch them.
[02:51:13.880 --> 02:51:22.320]  Man, I got a family dude, I don't like you doing that and they don't care
[02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:26.040]  their own families are going to get destroyed by this because there's the power trip
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:28.380]  like a Mazda flame.
[02:51:28.380 --> 02:51:32.560]  That's really what they are, they're Mazda flame, they're not conscious, you can't
[02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:37.920]  blame them but you've got a responsibility to stop them.
[02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:48.960]  They're clowns, from the Rothschilds all the way down to the bottom, from King Charles
[02:51:48.960 --> 02:51:51.560]  to you name it, they're idiots.
[02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:56.800]  Who believes you can break all these intergalactic rules, you can break all these common sense
[02:51:56.800 --> 02:51:59.120]  things of chivalry and that you're going to be protected.
[02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:02.400]  Well they believe they're insulated, they believe they're all powerful, they believe
[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:08.920]  they're God, they believe their manifest destiny is to do all this to us and again
[02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:12.880]  anybody with half a brain can analyse the trajectory of this and know it's certain
[02:52:12.880 --> 02:52:15.040]  destruction for everybody including them.
[02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:19.960]  I mean they're not going to kill all 8 billion of us and when they've done all
[02:52:19.960 --> 02:52:23.920]  this they'll be hunted down no matter what, I don't even care to hunt them down,
[02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:26.880]  they're garbage to me, God's going to destroy them.
[02:52:26.880 --> 02:52:31.440]  God will destroy their souls, God will contend with their essence, their energy, their
[02:52:31.480 --> 02:52:34.800]  bodies mean nothing to me, I don't want to fight them, I don't want to destroy them
[02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:40.080]  but I have to fight them, I have to destroy them because they're not stopping attacking
[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:46.040]  our people and they can kill our bodies folks but they can manipulate and get our
[02:52:46.040 --> 02:52:50.880]  children convinced to be led by them to the dark side and that is what we cannot
[02:52:50.880 --> 02:52:56.240]  allow them to do is corrupt the youth and they've done it and we've sat there and
[02:52:56.240 --> 02:53:00.680]  the deception and the evil being poured out and the satanic energy is incredibly intense,
[02:53:00.680 --> 02:53:08.800]  believe me I know, I'm tempted by it but in the temptation I get the devil cannot help
[02:53:08.800 --> 02:53:16.720]  it but contend and try to force the will and staring into those eyes we are able to
[02:53:16.720 --> 02:53:20.720]  get the enemy's operation by staring into the abyss, yes you can become the abyss
[02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:24.520]  but you can also stare into the abyss and then you get the knowledge of the enemy
[02:53:24.520 --> 02:53:29.160]  by contending with it and oh the Holy Spirit do I have the power to do that and it's
[02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:36.240]  not me but yes I am able to tune in the frequency of the Luciferian force and it is
[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:45.680]  a prideful out-of-control false messianic transmission and it is alluring when you're
[02:53:45.680 --> 02:53:50.520]  young and don't have wisdom but later becomes disgusting I hate tuning over to the
[02:53:50.520 --> 02:53:55.660]  Satan channel but I'm tuned into it right now and that's why I can hardly talk because I'm
[02:53:55.660 --> 02:54:05.980]  just like oh my god this is horrible and forgive them father they do not what they
[02:54:05.980 --> 02:54:19.860]  do, they know not what they do, just air a promo we'll go to break I'll come back

[02:59:58.220 --> 03:00:10.740]  alright I'm not gonna do this justice right now but I'm going to cover it
[03:00:10.740 --> 03:00:17.380]  your piece keeps coming unclipped and then I'm gonna start the show tomorrow
[03:00:17.380 --> 03:00:22.260]  with us when I'm loaded for bear ready to go 11 a.m. central Mara I'm
[03:00:22.260 --> 03:00:26.700]  gonna cover the waterfront on it all right so there's endless clips from the
[03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:31.740]  Pentagon and DARPA and MIT and they're the other head groups admitting all
[03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:34.460]  this now they're going to create new viruses and they'd be released and
[03:00:34.460 --> 03:00:37.820]  they take control and we've played a lot of that before and so the more I
[03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:40.100]  think about these stories and a lot of play that clip wanna play this
[03:00:40.100 --> 03:00:44.700]  clip and just we can make a 10-hour documentary about this but we ran
[03:00:44.700 --> 03:00:49.300]  across a bunch of high-level DARPA meetings I did yesterday
[03:00:49.460 --> 03:01:03.540]  haphazardly where 2017 1819 they were talking about hey we're already
[03:01:03.540 --> 03:01:06.620]  microchipping the troops we already can give them supervision to see full
[03:01:06.620 --> 03:01:10.580]  spectrum stuff and we got to make them disabled after that because it
[03:01:10.580 --> 03:01:13.780]  brain damages them and we've already got these super soldier programs which we
[03:01:13.780 --> 03:01:16.900]  already know about but they're admitting all this at the Pentagon
[03:01:17.060 --> 03:01:20.740]  and I've never even seen all this stuff and that's just part of it I mean it's
[03:01:20.740 --> 03:01:25.420]  crazy and I think I think that's it it's like trying to watch five hours of
[03:01:25.420 --> 03:01:28.660]  this it would take you a year to write a book about it I mean it's it's
[03:01:28.660 --> 03:01:33.900]  it's it's mind-blowing and and they keep saying and this is just what's
[03:01:33.900 --> 03:01:40.580]  declassified and remember my dad like in 1983 because he was a pioneer in
[03:01:40.580 --> 03:01:45.160]  implants dental surgery the Pentagon tried to hire him and a bunch the top
[03:01:45.200 --> 03:01:50.040]  implant doctors to go work in Maryland at some underground base with some secret
[03:01:50.040 --> 03:01:54.000]  program in cybernetics and my dad they never gave him the full thing my mom
[03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:56.120]  didn't want to go we didn't go there it was a lot of money he didn't
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:02:00.360]  do it I just heard about it at the dinner table so imagine how big this
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:04.920]  project is and that's my own personal experience but you don't need to
[03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:12.320]  hear from Alex Jones here's the Pentagon admitting all of this I mean
[03:02:12.520 --> 03:02:22.960]  listen to these clips I've got dozens of these we just grabbed today you know
[03:02:22.960 --> 03:02:29.080]  what let's play clip let's play clip 9 first where they introduce it at DARPA
[03:02:29.080 --> 03:02:36.000]  and the army are running this joint deal multi-quote level highest level
[03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:45.440]  with the directors are there and they call it the mad scientists meeting
[03:02:45.440 --> 03:02:49.960]  here it is so if you love if you love the army mad scientist team because
[03:02:49.960 --> 03:02:54.680]  you're on it I hope you do love it you want to connect to past content and
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:58.380]  why does this why is this related to our next presenter because the way
[03:02:58.380 --> 03:03:03.400]  this works is is we're connected every day to bright people who are
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:07.640]  thinking about things maybe the Army's not hearing all the time and that's how
[03:03:07.640 --> 03:03:17.640]  we came across dr. giardina and you saw it on the screen there the mad
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:25.080]  scientist conference so here here here's the head neurologist neuro
[03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:34.240]  ethics professor at Georgetown University giardano talking about weapons
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:40.560]  of mass disruption and how governments could release he goes on pry on
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:45.560]  crystals and other things to make everybody sick then you think it's a
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:49.960]  reoccurring virus but really you've been soft killed and they even call it
[03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:55.560]  soft weapons well here it is you can develop a variety of different drugs
[03:03:55.560 --> 03:03:59.280]  that can be used in war fighting scenarios now what I want to make sure
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:03.400]  you understand is that these drugs can not only enhance the warfighter with
[03:04:03.400 --> 03:04:07.880]  regard to maximizing their particular capability but can also be used to
[03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:12.320]  maximize war fighting capability by then affecting others so clearly I can
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:16.480]  affect others by either what I'm doing making me better or what I do to
[03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:21.840]  them making them quote less better or at very very least not wanting to fight in
[03:04:21.840 --> 03:04:27.680]  the main these are indeed weapons of mass disruption not destruction and the
[03:04:27.680 --> 03:04:30.560]  reason that I mentioned this to you is that that absence of mass
[03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:34.160]  destruction has in some cases veiled them for closer scrutiny but the
[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:37.680]  disruptive effect can be huge so for example one of the things that we
[03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:41.680]  can do is we can use a variety of these new forms of drugs that target
[03:04:41.680 --> 03:04:45.040]  specific functions of the nervous system such things like affiliation
[03:04:45.040 --> 03:04:49.680]  amelioration attitudes behaviors and cognitions and we can target key
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:58.320]  individuals early this morning we had general spoke to all when I tell you
[03:04:58.320 --> 03:05:02.320]  we have the ultimate bone broth hands down this is the most concentrated
[03:05:02.320 --> 03:05:07.280]  high quality bone broth there is concentrated chicken broth patented
[03:05:07.280 --> 03:05:11.120]  amazing then a huge dose of chaga mushroom a massive dose of meat
[03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:16.160]  pollen a gigantic dose of highest quality tumeric and then it just gets
[03:05:16.160 --> 03:05:20.080]  crazier from there it's about to sell out we haven't had it in stock for years
[03:05:20.080 --> 03:05:24.920]  this first new run is about to sell out get it discounted right now 40% off

[03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:09.040]  worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex Jones
[03:06:09.720 --> 03:06:17.680]  so here's one of the directors of major Air Force Pentagon operations the head
[03:06:17.680 --> 03:06:24.080]  of the Georgetown University mind control operation and then there's
[03:06:24.080 --> 03:06:28.080]  countless videos of these I watched five hours this is yesterday this is
[03:06:28.080 --> 03:06:33.380]  DARPA level top-level directors okay at the Pentagon this is the army
[03:06:33.380 --> 03:06:41.220]  hosting this and here he's talking about in 2017 five years ago six years
[03:06:41.220 --> 03:06:48.380]  ago nanomatter in the brain that causes strokes that is a nanoparticle
[03:06:48.380 --> 03:06:53.260]  well what do they admit COVID is it's just a nanoparticle it you can get
[03:06:53.260 --> 03:06:56.260]  it from the COVID but much worse from the shot they just pollute everything
[03:06:56.260 --> 03:07:00.300]  with it and then it degrades society and breaks you down they're bombing us
[03:07:00.300 --> 03:07:04.380]  with it go ahead and roll the tape moreover you heard earlier about the
[03:07:04.380 --> 03:07:08.860]  idea of nanoparticulate matter that can be utilized in a weaponizable way and
[03:07:08.860 --> 03:07:12.100]  here too we're looking very very strongly at what nanoparticulate matter
[03:07:12.100 --> 03:07:15.540]  can do to the nervous system some ongoing studies with our colleagues in
[03:07:15.540 --> 03:07:18.780]  the medical branches of NATO have in fact shown that the use of
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:22.620]  nanoparticulate matter in a scatter arrangement can be used to incur what
[03:07:22.620 --> 03:07:27.180]  looks to be broad scale epidemiological stroke epidemics so we're able to do
[03:07:27.180 --> 03:07:30.380]  here is infiltrate the brain space with nanoparticulate matter that
[03:07:30.380 --> 03:07:34.420]  aggregates insight to on-site in the brain and there's one of two things
[03:07:34.420 --> 03:07:39.380]  either penetrates from the vascular space gets into the bloodstream gets in
[03:07:39.380 --> 03:07:43.220]  through the nose through the mucosa or infiltrates the vascular space and
[03:07:43.220 --> 03:07:46.240]  clogs it what is the result what's called a nanoparticulate stroke or a
[03:07:46.240 --> 03:07:50.500]  hemorrhagic diathesis fancy word for it's a predisposition to individuals
[03:07:50.500 --> 03:07:54.420]  having brain bleeds demonstrated oh absolutely we're able to show animal
[03:07:54.420 --> 03:07:56.740]  models of same in the Italian group has done a fair amount of work
[03:07:56.740 --> 03:08:00.380]  demonstrating that nanoparticulate matter can be highly disruptive not only
[03:08:00.380 --> 03:08:03.780]  a brain vascularity but brain function you may not necessarily incur
[03:08:03.780 --> 03:08:06.380]  a stroke which going to begin to disrupt the network properties of the
[03:08:06.380 --> 03:08:10.340]  brain and as a result engage something more of a long wars effect through the
[03:08:10.340 --> 03:08:12.600]  use of these types of matters where you now begin to influence the
[03:08:12.600 --> 03:08:17.140]  population in increasingly concentric circles of expansion and they go on to
[03:08:17.140 --> 03:08:19.700]  say if a country's not doing what you want you just release this and make
[03:08:19.700 --> 03:08:24.060]  them all sick so I've got all the clips you know what I may just do four
[03:08:24.100 --> 03:08:29.940]  hours tomorrow and just play one of his one hour events and just analyze each
[03:08:29.940 --> 03:08:33.340]  piece of as we go because that's how evil this is I mean it's got to be
[03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:37.140]  looked at every aspect of it and believe they're gonna like us looking
[03:08:37.140 --> 03:08:40.740]  at it believe their alarms going off right now they're not up there
[03:08:40.740 --> 03:08:43.580]  they're not happy they think we're animals they're at the big person
[03:08:43.580 --> 03:08:46.300]  table we're at the little kid table like Thanksgiving we're not supposed to
[03:08:46.300 --> 03:08:48.900]  be hearing all this you're not supposed to be reading the white papers
[03:08:48.900 --> 03:08:55.940]  you're not supposed to know about it but notice what else he said there it
[03:08:55.940 --> 03:09:01.140]  looks like it's a biological virus but really we've sprayed people with a
[03:09:01.140 --> 03:09:06.900]  prion that may not kill you right away with a stroke but is gonna cause
[03:09:06.900 --> 03:09:14.460]  Alzheimer's like effects that's a long war long COVID remember long COVID
[03:09:14.460 --> 03:09:19.220]  and and remember I was sitting there when we went to like challenge the
[03:09:19.220 --> 03:09:30.620]  election in Arizona it was in late November 2020 and I landed in in Phoenix
[03:09:30.620 --> 03:09:35.020]  and I get out and I go protest at night and I'm I go outside to shoot a
[03:09:35.020 --> 03:09:38.820]  report outside the hotel and a bus drives by saying young people now have
[03:09:38.820 --> 03:09:43.660]  strokes we've got video of that and then another bus drives by like three
[03:09:43.660 --> 03:09:49.620]  moments later it says heart attacks are now normal in young people then
[03:09:49.620 --> 03:09:56.900]  another bus drives by nanotech soon will protect you from new diseases so
[03:09:56.900 --> 03:10:05.140]  before the shot even came out just like as in the December or October 2020
[03:10:05.140 --> 03:10:09.180]  FDA report they said oh it's gonna cause myocarditis heart attacks blood
[03:10:09.180 --> 03:10:14.540]  clot strokes they already had the buses out to subconsciously ready hey
[03:10:14.540 --> 03:10:19.300]  kids have heart attacks now kids have strokes it's normal you didn't know
[03:10:19.300 --> 03:10:21.660]  everybody has work problems like people never used to have cancer was
[03:10:21.660 --> 03:10:24.620]  super rare now it's everybody's got it it's like so the buses are
[03:10:24.620 --> 03:10:26.940]  driving around like I'm in the Twilight Zone episode I mean they
[03:10:26.940 --> 03:10:32.580]  live like heart attacks and strokes are quite normal in children but we've got
[03:10:32.580 --> 03:10:36.580]  nanotech to save you and we get the videos I made him sit out there for
[03:10:36.580 --> 03:10:41.020]  like an hour I'm sitting there drinking coffee and like oh my skin again
[03:10:41.020 --> 03:10:45.140]  remember we got the video I'm like look look look the CDC they're telling
[03:10:45.140 --> 03:10:47.940]  you and then there was ads and newspapers oh it's normal to have
[03:10:47.940 --> 03:10:54.860]  strokes it's normal to have heart attacks oh it's it's everywhere now so
[03:10:54.860 --> 03:10:58.660]  they hit you with the weapon and then they sit back and tell you oh it's
[03:10:58.660 --> 03:11:03.940]  normal everybody has heart attacks now it's a conspiracy theory that people
[03:11:03.940 --> 03:11:08.820]  used to live to 70 or 80 or 90 no no you live to 20 now oh yeah it is true
[03:11:08.820 --> 03:11:12.020]  the sperm counts down 90% it is true most people are infertile it's just
[03:11:12.020 --> 03:11:21.300]  normal enjoy the atrazine so they know we're nice people and they know we
[03:11:21.300 --> 03:11:24.020]  would never think of something like this I mean just even think about it
[03:11:24.020 --> 03:11:31.900]  it's just like what but it's real I have five hours of this and I'm telling
[03:11:31.900 --> 03:11:35.820]  you it's all just as horrible I played like two minutes of it are you not
[03:11:35.820 --> 03:11:39.740]  blown away would you like to hear more
[03:11:40.060 --> 03:11:48.140]  this is just one of these people and what did Peter Dasik specifically go
[03:11:48.140 --> 03:11:53.060]  to the Pentagon in 2017 at the same time this guy's given conferences to
[03:11:53.060 --> 03:12:01.660]  the Pentagon at the army for DARPA at the mad scientist conference what do
[03:12:01.660 --> 03:12:16.780]  they say they say the public will never know what hit them and it talks about
[03:12:16.780 --> 03:12:20.300]  how they're gonna mind control us
[03:12:23.700 --> 03:12:28.700]  desert weapons of mass disruption defunding the police opening the borders
[03:12:28.700 --> 03:12:35.020]  human smuggling fentanyl devaluing the dollar inflation all weapons of mass
[03:12:35.020 --> 03:12:41.540]  disruption because you were bad folks you didn't want drag queen pedophile time
[03:12:41.540 --> 03:12:45.740]  you didn't want to devalue the dollar you didn't want war with Russia well
[03:12:45.740 --> 03:12:51.420]  then you've got to be hit as he said he goes on the full conference to say
[03:12:51.420 --> 03:12:55.100]  you can hit armies you can hit foreign countries you can even target
[03:12:55.100 --> 03:12:59.100]  individuals that raise specific weapons but the best thing is just to hit a
[03:12:59.100 --> 03:13:05.740]  whole population and then out of the crisis we'll be able to study what
[03:13:05.740 --> 03:13:10.180]  happens to these people and get new advances for ourselves and he says for
[03:13:10.180 --> 03:13:15.780]  military interests he doesn't talk about American interest or his
[03:13:15.780 --> 03:13:24.340]  children's interest or your interest he talks about the military's interest
[03:13:25.940 --> 03:13:31.180]  all right here's how I'm gonna do
[03:13:36.500 --> 03:13:41.420]  what's my clip for he talks about electromagnetic you know he gets into
[03:13:41.420 --> 03:13:44.780]  oh we have microwaves we're already mind controlling people with that I mean
[03:13:44.780 --> 03:13:51.060]  they talk about weaponized insects and he says this is not theoretical this is
[03:13:51.060 --> 03:13:57.820]  what's declassified this isn't what she got currently going on operational
[03:13:57.820 --> 03:14:03.260]  you've got classified and you've got theoretical he's like oh no everything
[03:14:03.260 --> 03:14:08.820]  I'm telling you here everything he says you look up is operational blood
[03:14:08.820 --> 03:14:14.020]  blood for the idea of neurosensory devices and a whole host of transit
[03:14:14.020 --> 03:14:17.580]  intracranial pulse stimulators and of course these can be used for a
[03:14:17.580 --> 03:14:21.380]  variety of things with key individuals once again particularly when it comes to
[03:14:21.380 --> 03:14:25.100]  trans and intracranial devices I'm not looking for this to be weapons of mass
[03:14:25.100 --> 03:14:28.980]  use I'm looking to target key individuals who may then be influential
[03:14:28.980 --> 03:14:32.740]  to relative aspects of their representative groups I can affect
[03:14:32.740 --> 03:14:35.860]  individuals brain functions in a variety of different ways both
[03:14:35.860 --> 03:14:39.860]  positively and negatively by engaging or disengaging nodes and networks of the
[03:14:39.860 --> 03:14:42.900]  brain that therefore affect their cognitions emotions and ultimately
[03:14:42.900 --> 03:14:46.220]  their behaviors moreover by understanding the way the brain
[03:14:46.220 --> 03:14:50.580]  works as nodes and networks and not as key sites that are doing any particular
[03:14:50.580 --> 03:14:55.540]  thing I can also utilize various forms of electromagnetic radiation and
[03:14:55.540 --> 03:14:59.380]  energy to be able to disrupt brain function the brain is electromagnetic
[03:14:59.380 --> 03:15:03.340]  organ and like any other electromagnetic substance the integrity of those
[03:15:03.340 --> 03:15:06.740]  networks is reliant upon the electromagnetic pulses that flow in
[03:15:06.740 --> 03:15:11.260]  between them utilizing electromagnetic sensory and disruptive devices in this
[03:15:11.260 --> 03:15:15.580]  way with ever greater fidelity and with ever greater granularity can be used
[03:15:15.580 --> 03:15:20.060]  as not only an organ against individuals but against groups and in fact this is
[03:15:20.060 --> 03:15:23.060]  some of the work that we've seen that has been conducted previously in what
[03:15:23.060 --> 03:15:27.140]  was the Soviet Union now Russia and also China is looking very very deeply
[03:15:27.140 --> 03:15:30.700]  into what electromagnetic pulse generation can do to the brain with
[03:15:30.700 --> 03:15:34.860]  regard to treating diseases and also incurring certain disease states and
[03:15:34.860 --> 03:15:38.860]  individuals who may then be susceptible will may be exposed to such pulses
[03:15:38.860 --> 03:15:42.860]  yeah so they can basically just give you cancer or you know make you think you have asthma or anything
[03:15:43.100 --> 03:15:48.980]  look we only scratched the surface of this tomorrow 11 a.m. central we're gonna lay it all
[03:15:48.980 --> 03:15:51.580]  out everybody you know tune in this is really important

[03:19:53.900 --> 03:20:04.580]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:05.900 --> 03:20:17.539]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host Maria Z, coming to you live
[03:20:17.539 --> 03:20:23.859]  from the Brightion Studios. They've been gracious enough to give me a studio to use during my
[03:20:23.859 --> 03:20:28.880]  travels and let me tell you something guys, I work in the alternative media world. I've
[03:20:28.880 --> 03:20:35.520]  met a lot of people that do independent media, but there's very, very few that really stand
[03:20:35.520 --> 03:20:42.119]  out to me. And of course, this could be just my opinion, but I've seen the Infowars team,
[03:20:42.119 --> 03:20:48.020]  I've been there in studio, I've seen how dedicated and hardworking these people are, how seriously
[03:20:48.020 --> 03:20:53.240]  they take this. Brightion is very much the same, you all know Mike Adams and the team
[03:20:53.240 --> 03:20:58.359]  here, I mean just hardworking people that are committed to bringing the truth in
[03:20:58.359 --> 03:21:05.720]  real time. And I'm just so, so grateful to be working alongside these amazing people that are
[03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:10.600]  working with integrity. And when we say independent media, we truly mean independent. There isn't a
[03:21:10.600 --> 03:21:15.619]  board of directors, there isn't a group paying them and telling them what to say. When you're
[03:21:15.619 --> 03:21:20.760]  watching either Brightion or Infowars or Z Media, you are watching truly independent media,
[03:21:20.760 --> 03:21:26.039]  so that is crucial. That is crucial, especially because of the times that we are about to go
[03:21:26.039 --> 03:21:31.880]  into. And I'm so glad that Alex played those clips from Dr. James Giordano, I hope he plays more
[03:21:31.880 --> 03:21:37.359]  of that tomorrow, he said he's going to. I've watched quite a few of this man's presentations,
[03:21:37.359 --> 03:21:42.160]  let me tell you, it will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. And I think it's
[03:21:42.160 --> 03:21:47.080]  very, very timely that Alex is talking about this. I mean, we've spoken, I've spoken about
[03:21:47.080 --> 03:21:51.960]  Dr. Giordano here on this broadcast in the past, I think when I had guest Celeste
[03:21:51.960 --> 03:21:57.720]  Solomon and he talks about the fact that they can essentially hypnotise entire populations,
[03:21:57.720 --> 03:22:06.720]  demoralise them, they can completely manipulate the minds of the population to even stop an
[03:22:06.720 --> 03:22:13.600]  uprising. He talks about being able to meet with the leader of a resistance movement, put
[03:22:13.600 --> 03:22:21.400]  something on the top of his pen that he just touches and then goes back to his resistance
[03:22:21.400 --> 03:22:28.520]  movement, changes his mind about the bad guys and completely dismantles the entire resistance
[03:22:28.520 --> 03:22:35.400]  movement. This is the kind of stuff, as Alex said, that is declassified. So you can imagine
[03:22:35.400 --> 03:22:41.160]  the classified stuff and what their capabilities actually are. And I think that we have grossly,
[03:22:41.160 --> 03:22:47.320]  grossly underestimated just how far these people will go to stop the resistance,
[03:22:47.600 --> 03:22:53.600]  but they have grossly underestimated how powerful the resistance is because do you know what happens
[03:22:53.600 --> 03:22:59.279]  when you crush people, when you censor people, when you make it near impossible for them to
[03:22:59.279 --> 03:23:05.720]  continue getting the truth out? Those people become more resilient. We haven't weakened under
[03:23:05.720 --> 03:23:11.240]  your tactics. We haven't weakened under tyranny. We've grown stronger and we're going to keep
[03:23:11.240 --> 03:23:18.520]  getting stronger and stronger as the days go on. So you can't bank on that. You can't bank on us
[03:23:18.520 --> 03:23:23.840]  giving up. We are not going to give up. That is a personal promise, from me at least, and I believe
[03:23:23.840 --> 03:23:29.480]  I speak for everyone at Infowars and Brightion when I say that as well. But today I want to
[03:23:29.480 --> 03:23:35.199]  talk to you about what's happening at Burning Man, the Marburg, Ebola, PsyOp, the imminent threat
[03:23:35.199 --> 03:23:40.760]  of a cyber attack, nanotech in the injections, mandates returning. Trump has actually come out
[03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:46.760]  with a statement regarding injection injuries and Twitter is now admitting to harvesting your
[03:23:46.760 --> 03:23:50.880]  data. We've got a lot to cover today. I want to talk about what the WEF has said about the
[03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:55.039]  cyber attack, but I want to break down the current state of affairs for you today. As I'm
[03:23:55.039 --> 03:24:01.119]  traveling across the United States, I'm gathering intel from all of the various people that we're
[03:24:01.119 --> 03:24:08.359]  meeting with and it's becoming more and more clear how serious and dangerous the position
[03:24:08.400 --> 03:24:13.400]  that we are in right now is. And when I talk about the danger of the position, it may seem
[03:24:13.400 --> 03:24:18.440]  like I'm contradicting myself when I'm saying we're not going to give up, we're stronger than
[03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:26.240]  ever, but we are at serious risk. No. The two go hand in hand because when you're a realist
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:32.000]  and you acknowledge the severity and just how serious the position that you're in and how
[03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:36.640]  real the threat is and you assess every threat from every side and you prepare accordingly,
[03:24:36.720 --> 03:24:42.400]  that is a stronger position than pretending that threat doesn't exist. So we're going to break
[03:24:42.400 --> 03:24:47.080]  down some of those threats today based on what I'm hearing, what information I'm gathering and
[03:24:47.080 --> 03:24:51.359]  from what I can see coming down the pipeline. And it's very different when you're on the other
[03:24:51.359 --> 03:24:57.160]  side of the world. And although I've been screaming from the rooftops for years now and I
[03:24:57.160 --> 03:25:02.320]  know that many of the media's listeners and the Infowars audience are aware of how serious
[03:25:02.320 --> 03:25:06.160]  this is and the fact that it hasn't calmed down just because you can go outside and have
[03:25:06.199 --> 03:25:12.039]  a picnic now without your death shot doesn't mean the New World Order's just gone away.
[03:25:12.039 --> 03:25:16.840]  They've just given you breathing space so that you can go and try and enjoy life as normal and
[03:25:16.840 --> 03:25:21.359]  not pay so much attention anymore. Meanwhile, the laws that they're bringing in, the
[03:25:21.359 --> 03:25:25.880]  declarations that they're bringing in, Alex alluded to the UN declaration, they are signing
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:31.680]  the political declaration this month which will turn the UN into a world dictatorship.
[03:25:32.600 --> 03:25:37.800]  That is what we are on the precipice of a one-world government and most people don't even know it.
[03:25:37.800 --> 03:25:46.000]  And in May of next year, we've got the World Health Organization, the medical,
[03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:54.520]  military, martial law arm of the United Nations wanting to finalise the international
[03:25:54.520 --> 03:25:58.920]  health regulations. That in the initial proposal said that in the next pandemic they will not
[03:25:58.920 --> 03:26:04.359]  consider your human rights, your dignity or your fundamental freedoms. They'll do whatever
[03:26:04.359 --> 03:26:10.039]  it takes to get these death shots in your arm which aren't just about killing you by the way,
[03:26:10.039 --> 03:26:15.600]  they're about controlling your brain. And I've done so many stories on this but if I can
[03:26:15.600 --> 03:26:19.400]  direct people right now on the Stu Peters Network on Uncensored, I've got a four-part
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:25.440]  series airing called Agenda 2045 AI Apocalypse. It's also up on zmedia.com. Please go
[03:26:25.440 --> 03:26:31.080]  and watch it because we have grossly underestimated AI and nanotechnology and that's all I'll say on
[03:26:31.080 --> 03:26:36.720]  that for now. Everyone in the world needs to see that. But what we have right now is
[03:26:36.720 --> 03:26:43.560]  the propaganda coming back thick and fast about mandates, new COVID shots and this is converging
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:49.080]  with the timeline of the UN and the WHO when they want to become the dictators of the world.
[03:26:50.039 --> 03:26:57.840]  We have just a few short months before the WHO becomes the medical martial law enforcers
[03:26:57.840 --> 03:27:03.160]  of the world and they have said for countries that don't comply in future with their shot
[03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:10.440]  requirements, they will send enforcement from other countries. So what you have is the ones
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:18.039]  that are completely sold out like Australia, yes our government is for the most part,
[03:27:18.039 --> 03:27:24.480]  the ones who are completely sold out to the New World Order, they'll comply but what about the
[03:27:24.480 --> 03:27:30.279]  ones that don't? They will send enforcement from the countries that do comply to ensure
[03:27:30.279 --> 03:27:36.320]  they do comply with punishments in tow. This is out of the mouth of the World Health
[03:27:36.359 --> 03:27:41.119]  Assembly themselves. So everything that you're seeing right now, the COVID propaganda,
[03:27:41.119 --> 03:27:45.920]  everything is preparing us for that moment. I sent the team a picture of Jill Biden,
[03:27:45.920 --> 03:27:50.720]  an official statement if they can bring up that statement, she's got COVID again apparently
[03:27:50.720 --> 03:27:55.920]  and we know that Joe Biden said he's going to release a new injection that works,
[03:27:55.920 --> 03:28:02.279]  that actually works. Yes, statement of the first lady's communications director,
[03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:09.840]  she's currently experiencing mild symptoms and will remain in her home and apparently Joe
[03:28:09.840 --> 03:28:17.160]  Biden does not have COVID. None of these people have COVID. Do you remember in the height of the
[03:28:17.160 --> 03:28:20.960]  mandates and the pandemics, thank you for bringing that up guys, in the height of the
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:26.680]  mandates and the shots, they were getting celebrities and politicians to come out all the
[03:28:26.680 --> 03:28:32.400]  time and say oh I tested positive for COVID with a fake PCR test, it's going to return a false
[03:28:32.400 --> 03:28:38.039]  positive anyway and I'm injected to the eyeballs but here I am, I'm positive. Why? To normalise
[03:28:38.039 --> 03:28:44.080]  all the people that were getting sick from the shots and we have a very serious situation
[03:28:44.080 --> 03:28:49.000]  where people could start becoming very sick and I'm going to talk about that on the other side
[03:28:49.000 --> 03:28:52.560]  of the break and it's got to do with what's being programmed into the shots. Don't go
[03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:58.400]  anywhere, this is a power packed next half an hour. A lot of listeners have complained in the
[03:28:58.400 --> 03:29:03.199]  last two years that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available and that's because
[03:29:03.199 --> 03:29:07.960]  the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some. I turned down

[03:33:03.200 --> 03:33:04.760]  its alex jones
[03:33:06.400 --> 03:33:20.240]  So Fauci has said that he really really hopes that if mask recommendations return, he used
[03:33:20.240 --> 03:33:26.400]  the word recommendations, that people will comply.
[03:33:26.400 --> 03:33:29.160]  First of all, why are you speaking?
[03:33:29.160 --> 03:33:35.320]  You're done, your time is done, you told us you were retiring and you're really really
[03:33:35.320 --> 03:33:38.760]  worried about the fact that Americans won't comply.
[03:33:38.760 --> 03:33:39.760]  People won't comply.
[03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:41.440]  No, we won't comply.
[03:33:41.440 --> 03:33:43.199]  We will not comply.
[03:33:43.199 --> 03:33:47.440]  And here's the thing people, and I want to make this really clear, when Tedros came
[03:33:47.440 --> 03:33:54.840]  out with, if you recall, monkeypox, when COVID was done, the scare campaign with COVID
[03:33:54.840 --> 03:33:59.000]  was done, and so they said we need something new, let's do monkeypox.
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:03.600]  That was a test to test the public response and test the waters.
[03:34:03.600 --> 03:34:06.199]  And what happened was people laughed at it.
[03:34:06.199 --> 03:34:10.660]  And Tedros had an advisory board that said, we don't recommend that you declare this a
[03:34:10.660 --> 03:34:16.680]  public health emergency of international concern, and he overrode his advisory board in a show
[03:34:16.680 --> 03:34:20.600]  as to what will happen in future if the IHR amendments go through.
[03:34:20.600 --> 03:34:26.220]  He overrode those people and he said, I'm declaring it a fake anyway.
[03:34:26.220 --> 03:34:30.859]  That's how you read out the abbreviation of PHEIC, public health emergency of international
[03:34:30.859 --> 03:34:35.320]  concern, and it's hilarious that it's read out fake because that's what it is.
[03:34:35.320 --> 03:34:39.060]  So Tedros ignored the advisory board and made a dictatorial decision, and that's what
[03:34:39.060 --> 03:34:40.140]  he wants to do in future.
[03:34:40.140 --> 03:34:45.220]  But my point is, even though he did that, no one really went along with it, and monkeypox
[03:34:45.220 --> 03:34:47.619]  faded into oblivion.
[03:34:47.619 --> 03:34:52.060]  And that's exactly what's about to happen with COVID if we do the right thing and
[03:34:52.060 --> 03:34:53.060]  keep it up.
[03:34:53.060 --> 03:34:57.980]  And I'm seeing people all over social media mocking this, and that is exactly the response
[03:34:57.980 --> 03:34:58.980]  that is required.
[03:34:58.980 --> 03:34:59.980]  It should be mocked.
[03:35:00.100 --> 03:35:01.820]  It's ridiculous.
[03:35:01.820 --> 03:35:02.820]  It's ridiculous.
[03:35:02.820 --> 03:35:05.920]  I understand some people got sick for the most part, the people that I know had nothing
[03:35:05.920 --> 03:35:11.560]  more than the sniffles, some hot chicken soup and some aspirin, and they were okay.
[03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:17.740]  And for the ones who were really sick, the reason that they maybe died or had long-term
[03:35:17.740 --> 03:35:23.980]  suffering was because they were put on remdesivir, which is designed to kill you.
[03:35:23.980 --> 03:35:27.100]  I'm not downplaying when people get sick here, and I'm not telling people not to
[03:35:27.100 --> 03:35:35.300]  seek medical attention, but the scare campaign compared to the actual problem with COVID,
[03:35:35.300 --> 03:35:43.199]  which I think is under a 1% death rate, it's 0.03 something death rate, was completely
[03:35:43.199 --> 03:35:45.480]  blown out of proportion.
[03:35:45.480 --> 03:35:46.880]  So COVID's done.
[03:35:46.880 --> 03:35:52.020]  As far as I can see with the public, very few people wearing masks right now, although
[03:35:52.020 --> 03:35:56.740]  it is happening, and I know that some places are returning mandates, but the public is
[03:35:56.740 --> 03:35:57.740]  not going to have it.
[03:35:57.740 --> 03:36:02.340]  If we keep up that momentum and we laugh at this and we say, you've got to be kidding
[03:36:02.340 --> 03:36:09.000]  me, no, we're not doing this again, they will have to pivot to their new plans.
[03:36:09.000 --> 03:36:17.340]  And that is a real possibility, very, very important to assess things critically from
[03:36:17.340 --> 03:36:21.020]  a position of understanding that you are at war.
[03:36:21.020 --> 03:36:22.260]  So that's what we're doing right now.
[03:36:22.260 --> 03:36:25.060]  Now, I want to talk about Burning Man.
[03:36:25.060 --> 03:36:30.460]  I shared some reports that were being circulated across social media.
[03:36:30.460 --> 03:36:32.220]  Now, I'm not claiming any of these are fact.
[03:36:32.220 --> 03:36:36.060]  I want to tell you what social media reports were saying.
[03:36:36.060 --> 03:36:40.980]  So what we were hearing was people, it was a particular text exchange where someone
[03:36:40.980 --> 03:36:47.840]  was saying that his friend was vomiting coagulated blood, that white coats were on scene, that
[03:36:47.840 --> 03:36:52.100]  people weren't being allowed in or out, that's correct, and that people were being told
[03:36:52.100 --> 03:36:56.580]  to stay in their RVs and signs, notices were being passed around that if you were
[03:36:56.580 --> 03:37:01.520]  experiencing nausea, vomiting from the nose or mouth and all these other symptoms, do
[03:37:01.520 --> 03:37:03.619]  not leave your RV.
[03:37:03.619 --> 03:37:08.920]  We also had a social media user who was at LAX at the time of an evacuation who
[03:37:08.920 --> 03:37:14.380]  claimed that this was because a private jet came in from Burning Man at the time
[03:37:14.380 --> 03:37:18.340]  when no one was allowed in or out, and that is the reason that people were being
[03:37:18.340 --> 03:37:21.940]  evacuated while the media was saying no, no, no, it was a safety concern.
[03:37:21.940 --> 03:37:27.300]  Okay, any of these things are possible and they may not be true.
[03:37:27.300 --> 03:37:31.920]  What I did notice was that the media and fact checker frenzy immediately commenced
[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:36.580]  to discredit the information, but what I want to consider is that it may not actually
[03:37:36.580 --> 03:37:38.820]  be credible information.
[03:37:38.820 --> 03:37:41.940]  I think that what's going on here is that they're testing the waters and the public's
[03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:48.380]  response to a threat like Marburg or Ebola and that there's a reason why.
[03:37:48.380 --> 03:37:53.380]  The United States has already invested the money into a Marburg-style emergency with
[03:37:53.380 --> 03:38:00.900]  injections at the ready with a declaration of that emergency response expiring in August
[03:38:00.900 --> 03:38:02.320]  of 2025.
[03:38:02.320 --> 03:38:08.460]  It would be a huge waste of money if they didn't put their preparation to the test, and
[03:38:08.460 --> 03:38:14.760]  what I shared this morning in light of the Burning Man situation, it was very, very
[03:38:14.760 --> 03:38:15.760]  interesting timing.
[03:38:15.760 --> 03:38:21.940]  If the team can bring that up, NYC Health and Hospitals leads multi-agency training
[03:38:21.940 --> 03:38:27.720]  exercise for Marburg virus and Ebola-like disease.
[03:38:27.720 --> 03:38:31.560]  This was on the nychealthandhospitals.org website.
[03:38:31.560 --> 03:38:33.800]  If you guys have got it, please bring it up.
[03:38:33.800 --> 03:38:36.160]  If not, I'll just read it out.
[03:38:36.160 --> 03:38:40.800]  Patients simulated symptoms of Marburg virus to test healthcare providers' ability to
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:47.240]  quickly identify, isolate, and coordinate transport to New York City Health and Hospitals
[03:38:47.240 --> 03:38:48.240]  Bellevue.
[03:38:48.240 --> 03:38:53.359]  During the drill, healthcare and EMS workers donned appropriate personal protective equipment
[03:38:53.359 --> 03:38:58.460]  and followed strict protocols to protect against exposure to the simulated pathogen.
[03:38:58.460 --> 03:39:00.960]  This is as of August the 3rd.
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:04.359]  Now, they did say that the risk of Marburg coming to New York City is very low, but
[03:39:04.359 --> 03:39:07.600]  I did find the timing curious.
[03:39:07.600 --> 03:39:15.480]  Is it possible to create the symptoms of Marburg or an Ebola like a hemorrhagic fever
[03:39:15.480 --> 03:39:20.480]  through what's in the shots, the skies, the food, the water absolutely poisoning us
[03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:25.000]  from every single level, the nanotechnology that's coming into human beings from every
[03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:30.400]  angle and activate it via the 5G weapons system?
[03:39:30.400 --> 03:39:35.340]  Well, from the research that I've done, yes, it is.
[03:39:35.340 --> 03:39:39.119]  So I think this could have been a test to see how the public responds to that sort
[03:39:39.119 --> 03:39:40.119]  of a threat.
[03:39:40.119 --> 03:39:47.420]  They may have also tested on those people there at Burning Man who were sick and told
[03:39:47.420 --> 03:39:53.000]  them that, oh, you're vomiting because of the storm water or the rubbish or if you've
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:54.660]  got an upset tummy, it's this.
[03:39:54.660 --> 03:40:02.140]  But if you were a protester in Canberra, when we were told to go there and stay until
[03:40:02.140 --> 03:40:06.580]  the government lifts mandates and stops the injections.
[03:40:06.580 --> 03:40:14.380]  If you were a protester there and you experienced being microwaved, you would know that frequency
[03:40:14.380 --> 03:40:23.940]  attacks cause nausea, vomiting, headaches, burns under the clothing and we have confirmation
[03:40:23.940 --> 03:40:29.539]  that they did that to us now and I'll be speaking on that more very, very soon in
[03:40:29.539 --> 03:40:32.500]  an interview that's coming up.
[03:40:32.500 --> 03:40:41.140]  So they are very much capable of inflicting this type of invisible weapons system on people
[03:40:41.140 --> 03:40:47.660]  and the technology that's inside of people can be programmed in real time from what
[03:40:47.660 --> 03:40:51.580]  I'm hearing and the research that I've been doing.
[03:40:51.580 --> 03:40:56.060]  I interviewed Todd Callender and Lisa McGee, one of his researchers, quite some time ago
[03:40:56.060 --> 03:41:03.080]  who was looking through the patents and she was finding cesium in the shots, various
[03:41:03.080 --> 03:41:09.940]  types of yeast and other things that create the environment for this virus, that virus
[03:41:09.940 --> 03:41:13.859]  and we think that there is a potential for AI to program in real time.
[03:41:13.859 --> 03:41:20.380]  I know we're talking sci-fi stuff here, guys, but we're living in sci-fi times and it's
[03:41:20.380 --> 03:41:21.380]  not an understatement.
[03:41:21.380 --> 03:41:30.020]  Look at what Alex was talking about earlier about the AI, the weaponisation of AI by organisations
[03:41:30.020 --> 03:41:37.539]  like the ADL to pull down things that they say are offensive or they don't like and
[03:41:37.539 --> 03:41:40.460]  we have a similar thing with Twitter which we'll talk about on the other side of the
[03:41:40.460 --> 03:41:49.619]  break which I said from the start was a trap and it's proving to be true but we have
[03:41:49.619 --> 03:41:54.740]  a situation where there are invisible weapons that can be deployed at any moment against
[03:41:54.740 --> 03:41:56.600]  humanity.
[03:41:56.600 --> 03:42:01.740]  On top of that, we have the potential of a cyber attack as people become more aware.
[03:42:01.740 --> 03:42:04.279]  See, they're testing the waters now to see our response.
[03:42:04.279 --> 03:42:07.860]  For the most part, people are saying, no, you're not going to get away with this and
[03:42:07.860 --> 03:42:10.619]  on top of that, we're aware of your directed energy weapons.
[03:42:10.619 --> 03:42:14.619]  We're aware of how you destroy communities in order for BlackRock and Co to come and
[03:42:14.619 --> 03:42:15.900]  buy up the properties.
[03:42:15.900 --> 03:42:19.500]  We're aware of your smart city plans.
[03:42:19.500 --> 03:42:23.420]  I was just listening to a report about San Francisco insurance being cancelled.
[03:42:23.420 --> 03:42:29.460]  Well, where did they just buy up all of that land, that shadow company?
[03:42:29.460 --> 03:42:31.020]  Where did they just buy up all that land?
[03:42:31.020 --> 03:42:36.380]  Just in San Francisco, in California, outside of San Francisco, I believe it was.
[03:42:36.380 --> 03:42:39.340]  So why is all the insurance being cancelled?
[03:42:39.340 --> 03:42:43.860]  Because the area will be developed for that reason, very likely, just like they
[03:42:43.860 --> 03:42:46.460]  wanted to do in Maui.
[03:42:46.460 --> 03:42:51.619]  We talk more about what's coming down the pipeline and the cyber attacks on the other
[03:42:51.619 --> 03:42:52.619]  side of this break.
[03:42:52.619 --> 03:42:57.500]  It's very serious people.
[03:42:57.500 --> 03:42:58.500]  Bodies is back.
[03:42:58.500 --> 03:43:02.939]  The ultimate turmeric product on the market has returned to Infowarsstore.com and is
[03:43:02.939 --> 03:43:05.860]  now 25% off for a limited time.
[03:43:05.860 --> 03:43:10.460]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs
[03:43:10.460 --> 03:43:11.460]  today.
[03:43:11.460 --> 03:43:15.560]  Hundreds of peer reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry
[03:43:15.560 --> 03:43:19.640]  and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[03:43:19.640 --> 03:43:24.400]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,
[03:43:24.400 --> 03:43:29.439]  increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much
[03:43:29.439 --> 03:43:30.439]  more.
[03:43:30.439 --> 03:43:35.560]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[03:43:35.560 --> 03:43:41.240]  but our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[03:43:41.240 --> 03:43:42.240]  in turmeric.
[03:43:42.240 --> 03:43:45.680]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.
[03:43:45.680 --> 03:43:49.460]  So if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.
[03:43:49.460 --> 03:43:54.880]  Grab yourself a bottle today for 25% off at Infowarsstore.com and put your body
[03:43:54.880 --> 03:43:57.360]  at ease.
[03:43:57.360 --> 03:44:02.240]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire
[03:44:02.240 --> 03:44:04.119]  food supply.
[03:44:04.119 --> 03:44:08.720]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:44:08.720 --> 03:44:14.000]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, and there are two things
[03:44:14.000 --> 03:44:15.760]  we need to do about it.
[03:44:15.760 --> 03:44:19.100]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[03:44:19.100 --> 03:44:24.320]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[03:44:24.320 --> 03:44:29.939]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient
[03:44:29.939 --> 03:44:36.119]  amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet
[03:44:36.119 --> 03:44:38.000]  below the Earth's surface.
[03:44:38.000 --> 03:44:43.800]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[03:44:43.800 --> 03:44:49.960]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[03:44:49.960 --> 03:44:56.240]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism, get yours now at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:44:56.240 --> 03:44:57.760]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[03:44:57.760 --> 03:44:58.760]  Thought it was next week.
[03:44:58.760 --> 03:45:03.320]  I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[03:45:03.320 --> 03:45:06.920]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula, and the first thing I did was pop one of these
[03:45:06.920 --> 03:45:09.279]  bad boys.
[03:45:09.279 --> 03:45:11.160]  Overhead shot, please.
[03:45:11.160 --> 03:45:15.400]  Look how full this bottle is.
[03:45:15.400 --> 03:45:18.439]  Right to the top, folks.
[03:45:18.439 --> 03:45:23.279]  Right to the top with these 95% curcumin oil.
[03:45:23.279 --> 03:45:27.000]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:28.279]  Some are maybe 10.
[03:45:28.279 --> 03:45:31.039]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[03:45:31.039 --> 03:45:35.119]  This is 95%.
[03:45:35.119 --> 03:45:39.760]  Super constant, so like taking one pill, it's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:42.400]  It's that powerful, or more.
[03:45:42.400 --> 03:45:48.680]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com, Body's ultimate turmeric formula, sold out
[03:45:48.680 --> 03:45:56.560]  for almost eight months, back in stock at Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:56.560 --> 03:46:01.880]  The Infowars Live Silver Bullet Colloidal Silver has finally returned to celebrate this
[03:46:01.880 --> 03:46:04.560]  powerful product's long-awaited homecoming.

[03:46:57.240 --> 03:47:04.640]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:06.100 --> 03:47:19.100]  I really don't think they'll get away with another invisible threat, everyone. As in an invisible virus.
[03:47:19.100 --> 03:47:33.100]  The next thing that we see may very well be something where the symptoms are visible and serious, which is why I mentioned the ability to create symptoms through frequencies based on the activation of what's inside people right now.
[03:47:34.100 --> 03:47:48.100]  And I'm not just saying this to theorise here. I have interviewed countless people, experts, scientists, researchers who are confirming the same thing. Not to mention the intel I've gathered on the ground while I've been here.
[03:47:49.100 --> 03:47:57.100]  They may not go with that though. And this is why we're talking about it. Because when we discuss these things, we thwart their attempts like we did with monkeypox.
[03:47:57.100 --> 03:48:14.100]  We thwart their attempts. Don't ever underestimate the power of information in this war. It is an information war and the whole point is to get you to a point where you can't see, you can't distinguish between truth, psyops, fake information.
[03:48:14.100 --> 03:48:16.100]  But we're smarter than that.
[03:48:17.100 --> 03:48:27.100]  So try it on. The people are already aware of the different things that you may hit us with and we are prepared. That is the point of this broadcast.
[03:48:28.100 --> 03:48:45.100]  Now I want to talk about the fact that Donald Trump, if the guys can bring up the Gateway Pundit article, President Trump addresses vaccine adverse events for the first time, calls on Big Pharma to disclose safety data immediately.
[03:48:46.100 --> 03:49:03.100]  He did an interview with a former gubernatorial candidate, Tudor Dickson, and I have to say kudos to her. Out of all of the people that have interviewed President Trump, she's the only one that's had the courage to ask him about the shots.
[03:49:04.100 --> 03:49:06.100]  And to that, I really do commend her.
[03:49:06.100 --> 03:49:20.100]  And so Trump, essentially a lot of people, and the feedback that I'm seeing in my Telegram channel, which by the way is Z media, Z triple E media, one word, I'm in there almost every day except Sundays, but while I've been away, I've been in there every day, I want to stay in touch with people.
[03:49:22.100 --> 03:49:31.100]  They've said his response was weak, it was kind of evading the question. She asked about whether he would be helping and standing with the injection injured victims.
[03:49:31.100 --> 03:49:41.100]  In fact, she said to him, people are wanting you to support them. These people are expecting it and wanting to see you're supporting that. And he said, we'll stand for them in many ways. That was his response.
[03:49:42.100 --> 03:50:00.100]  So I agree there needs to be a stronger response from President Trump. And what I want to say is, if you care about your country, and if you care about your leaders, supporting them also means demanding a higher standard from them.
[03:50:01.100 --> 03:50:12.100]  Hey, Alex Jones did that when he called out for President Trump and gave him a timeline and said, please come out against the shots. That is the correct thing to do.
[03:50:13.100 --> 03:50:22.100]  Some people who are Trump supporters get upset with me over that. You shouldn't, because if you love someone and you want them to do well, you should hold them to a high standard.
[03:50:22.100 --> 03:50:36.100]  And that does mean correcting them. So he really does need to keep going on this path. He needs to stop speaking about how great Warp Speed was and really start talking about the corruption of Big Pharma and what these injections have done to people.
[03:50:37.100 --> 03:50:45.100]  This is a great start. And for people who say too little, too late, would you rather that or nothing? I am very grateful to this journalist.
[03:50:46.100 --> 03:50:58.100]  But another thing I want to talk to you about, going back to what I was saying before about the more the people wake up and the closer we get to the globalist being exposed, the more danger we're in. And I will go into that in a moment.
[03:50:59.100 --> 03:51:08.100]  But first, Twitter can now harvest your biometric information. If you guys can pull up that article from the Daily Mail, including fingerprint, face recognition, eye tracking data.
[03:51:08.100 --> 03:51:15.100]  Musk's site has quietly updated its terms and conditions for what they call safety purposes.
[03:51:16.200 --> 03:51:24.960]  Now, I've said this from the start, that this was masquerading as a free speech platform
[03:51:24.960 --> 03:51:29.900]  and Linda Yaccarino coming in saying, oh, freedom of speech but not freedom of reach.
[03:51:29.900 --> 03:51:32.100]  That's censorship, honey.
[03:51:32.100 --> 03:51:33.760]  It's the same thing.
[03:51:33.760 --> 03:51:37.760]  If people want to hear what I'm saying but you won't let them hear what I'm saying,
[03:51:37.760 --> 03:51:43.080]  whether you like the information or not, if you're limiting my reach, that is the same
[03:51:43.080 --> 03:51:45.160]  thing as deleting me.
[03:51:45.400 --> 03:51:51.720]  And you know how algorithms work.
[03:51:51.720 --> 03:51:59.000]  We have grossly underestimated AI and I think that it is much more in control of information
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:01.400]  right now than we realised.
[03:52:01.400 --> 03:52:08.279]  Which means that we are very much approaching the threat of cyber covid if the team can
[03:52:08.279 --> 03:52:12.520]  play that clip from the WEF and then I want to dissect it before we finish up today.
[03:52:13.000 --> 03:52:21.000]  The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken our economies and societies to the core and shown us how
[03:52:21.000 --> 03:52:26.040]  vulnerable we are to biological threats. In the digital world, similar risks are being
[03:52:26.040 --> 03:52:30.840]  overlooked right now. A cyber attack with COVID-like characteristics would spread faster
[03:52:30.840 --> 03:52:35.880]  and further than any biological virus. Its reproductive rate would be around 10 times
[03:52:35.880 --> 03:52:40.040]  greater than what we've experienced with the coronavirus. To give you an idea, one
[03:52:40.040 --> 03:52:46.440]  of the fastest worms in history, the 2003 Slamma Sapphire worm, doubled in size approximately every
[03:52:46.440 --> 03:52:54.680]  8.5 seconds, infecting over 75,000 devices in 10 minutes and almost 11 million devices in 24 hours.
[03:52:55.240 --> 03:53:00.280]  Fortunately, at least until now, cyber attacks have not impacted our health the way pandemics
[03:53:00.280 --> 03:53:05.080]  have, but the economic damages and therefore the impact they have had on our daily lives
[03:53:05.080 --> 03:53:10.680]  have been equal and sometimes even greater. You see, the only way to stop the exponential
[03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:15.080]  propagation of a COVID-like cyber threat is to fully disconnect the millions of vulnerable
[03:53:15.080 --> 03:53:21.160]  devices from one another and from the internet. All of this in a matter of days. A single day
[03:53:21.160 --> 03:53:26.280]  without the internet would cost our economies more than 50 billion US dollars and that's before
[03:53:26.280 --> 03:53:31.560]  considering the economic and societal damages should these devices be linked to essential services
[03:53:31.560 --> 03:53:37.160]  such as transport or healthcare. As the digital realm increasingly merges with our physical world,
[03:53:37.160 --> 03:53:41.400]  the ripple effects of cyber attacks on our safety just keep on expanding at a faster
[03:53:41.400 --> 03:53:46.280]  pace than what we're preparing for. COVID-19 was known as an anticipated risk,
[03:53:47.000 --> 03:53:52.440]  so is the digital equivalent. Let's be better prepared for that one. The time is now.
[03:53:54.120 --> 03:53:57.640]  All right, so that was a couple of years ago now that they released that,
[03:53:58.520 --> 03:54:04.840]  but I have replayed that clip and spoken about this since its release and the reason is
[03:54:04.840 --> 03:54:11.480]  because at any time, if too much truth comes out, if Trump starts speaking too much about
[03:54:11.480 --> 03:54:18.760]  the shots or if independent media continues to explode with information and audience at the
[03:54:18.760 --> 03:54:24.600]  rate that it is right now and it is growing, they could flick that switch and it is a switch
[03:54:24.600 --> 03:54:29.720]  and are we even at the point where AI is in self-preservation mode flicking the switch for
[03:54:29.720 --> 03:54:38.440]  itself? We don't know. We actually don't know. We see big tech and governments using AI.
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:44.760]  There was something about the UK government as well just the other day. They deployed AI during
[03:54:44.760 --> 03:54:49.880]  COVID. It was AI that was pulling information off. We thought it was a bunch of university
[03:54:50.600 --> 03:54:56.040]  students in India somewhere. Some of it was that. Some of it was AI.
[03:54:57.480 --> 03:55:04.200]  So we're already in a battle with AI. That's a very challenging battle to defeat and if it was
[03:55:04.200 --> 03:55:09.880]  to go into self-preservation mode or if the globalists were to go into self-preservation mode
[03:55:09.880 --> 03:55:17.480]  using AI and they went ahead with cyber COVID, the landscape would look very, very different
[03:55:17.480 --> 03:55:21.080]  on the other side of that. So very quickly, they say that the end result would be that
[03:55:21.080 --> 03:55:26.040]  millions of devices would be taken offline in a matter of days. When they say millions,
[03:55:26.040 --> 03:55:31.720]  they mean billions. They say the only way is to shut down all phones, all internet,
[03:55:31.720 --> 03:55:35.240]  all electricity, all communications so that you can't get the truth.
[03:55:35.240 --> 03:55:40.520]  All you have is the emergency broadcasting system which they've been testing constantly
[03:55:40.520 --> 03:55:47.640]  to hear their propaganda. You don't get access to the truth and I said this before.
[03:55:49.080 --> 03:55:54.920]  So many people say to me, oh, your broadcast or info wars or whatever got me through COVID
[03:55:54.920 --> 03:55:59.480]  and helped me be sure of my decision. What do you do? Are you strong enough? Ask yourselves
[03:55:59.480 --> 03:56:05.000]  right now, are you strong enough to withstand it? If something like this hits and we do have
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:09.960]  real blackouts and all you have is the EBS feeding you propaganda, are you strong enough?
[03:56:09.960 --> 03:56:11.720]  If you're not, you better get strong enough.
[03:56:11.900 --> 03:56:18.840]  I'm not saying this is going to happen tomorrow, but the risk is there and this is what we
[03:56:18.840 --> 03:56:20.420]  have to do when we're at war.
[03:56:20.420 --> 03:56:25.940]  We have to be real about the threats that we are facing and hopefully I've helped you
[03:56:25.940 --> 03:56:28.440]  with that today.
[03:56:28.440 --> 03:56:34.800]  They say, and Yuval Noah Harari has said this as well, when this cyber Covid, which
[03:56:34.800 --> 03:56:38.820]  they could name it anything when it happens, when it happens the only way to get back
[03:56:38.820 --> 03:56:42.600]  online is with a digital vaccine.
[03:56:42.600 --> 03:56:50.119]  This ties in very closely to the WHO, Global Health Certification Network, Digital ID,
[03:56:50.119 --> 03:56:52.980]  CBDC and the AI World Society.
[03:56:52.980 --> 03:56:55.480]  Please, I'm urging everyone, go and watch.
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:56:59.279]  If you can't find it on Rumble, just go to zmedia.com.
[03:56:59.279 --> 03:57:07.279]  Watch Agenda 2045 AI Apocalypse parts 1, 2 and 3 on the interviews page.
[03:57:07.300 --> 03:57:11.140]  You need to understand where these people are thinking.
[03:57:11.140 --> 03:57:12.580]  They're calling you objects.
[03:57:12.580 --> 03:57:17.699]  They're calling you objects in their AI World Society, which they're contracting you into
[03:57:17.699 --> 03:57:20.060]  without your consent.
[03:57:20.060 --> 03:57:23.539]  This could happen at any moment.
[03:57:23.539 --> 03:57:24.760]  Please prepare.
[03:57:24.760 --> 03:57:27.140]  Please share this broadcast with everyone.
[03:57:27.140 --> 03:57:31.060]  Tell your loved ones, remain strong, push back.
[03:57:31.060 --> 03:57:32.520]  Don't ever stop the pushback.
[03:57:32.520 --> 03:57:33.520]  We can win this.
[03:57:33.520 --> 03:57:38.740]  The New World Order always could have and still can be defeated by the people.
[03:57:38.740 --> 03:57:39.740]  God bless you.
[03:57:39.740 --> 03:57:40.740]  Thank you for joining me today.
[03:57:40.740 --> 03:57:41.940]  I'll see you very soon.
[03:57:41.940 --> 03:57:43.380]  Maria Z, signing out.
[03:57:44.000 --> 03:57:54.040]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[03:57:54.040 --> 03:58:00.520]  diet. They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it. And
[03:58:00.520 --> 03:58:07.680]  they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s. But the problem
[03:58:07.720 --> 03:58:14.280]  today is finding fish without a high mercury content. Your best option is our ultimate fish
[03:58:14.280 --> 03:58:22.480]  oil and ultimate krill oil at infowarsstore.com. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our
