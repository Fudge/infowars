[00:00.000 --> 00:29.640]  well was yesterday fun or what top to top of broadcast like yesterday but we're
[00:29.640 --> 00:40.200]  here anyway on this Thursday February 28th 2019 and Owen Schroyer filling in
[00:40.200 --> 00:46.200]  for Alex Jones today we will be hearing from Alex today and he will be
[00:46.200 --> 00:51.960]  obviously responding to the viral podcast that was the Joe Rogan experience
[00:51.960 --> 00:57.960]  yesterday as well as some other breaking news but you know it's pretty
[00:57.960 --> 01:08.680]  amazing that yesterday you had let me just go through it the Trump Kim summit
[01:08.680 --> 01:17.600]  in Vietnam you had Pakistan and India almost on the verge of full-out war you
[01:17.600 --> 01:26.680]  had the Michael Cohen testimony circus and in the middle of all that what was
[01:26.680 --> 01:31.400]  the number one story on social media what was the number one trend on social
[01:31.400 --> 01:38.800]  media what had everybody watching it by the end of the day Alex Jones on the
[01:38.800 --> 01:47.400]  Joe Rogan experience it's already up to 3 million views and that's just on the
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.480]  one YouTube page for Joe Rogan does Joe Rogan have Facebook or Twitter I don't
[01:53.480 --> 02:00.120]  know but you also take into account all of the clips that were put on Twitter
[02:00.120 --> 02:04.920]  and Facebook and YouTube and everywhere it's already probably got 10 million
[02:04.920 --> 02:10.720]  views but the full original on the YouTube Joe Rogan experience is about to
[02:10.720 --> 02:16.200]  hit 3 million views by the end of this broadcast and they were live for five
[02:16.200 --> 02:26.040]  hours and Alex Jones was classic Alex Jones and I don't even know what the
[02:26.040 --> 02:33.280]  takeaway from the fact that Alex Jones was trending above the Trump Kim summit
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.600]  almost a full-out war between India and Pakistan and the Michael Cohen hearing I
[02:39.600 --> 02:42.920]  really don't know what to take away from that I think there's a couple things to
[02:42.920 --> 02:55.360]  take away from that but isn't it isn't the real story how it just showed if
[02:55.360 --> 03:00.200]  you're watching right now we just have the video of Alex just I mean
[03:00.200 --> 03:07.200]  literally pumping his arms up and down for for three straight minutes flailing
[03:07.200 --> 03:13.400]  about as he's standing up for the unborn pretty incredible stuff and it was I
[03:13.400 --> 03:18.040]  mean Joe apparently had never heard of this new legislation the Democrats
[03:18.040 --> 03:26.760]  passed where if a baby's born and it's alive well you just let it die you don't
[03:26.760 --> 03:34.280]  give it treatment really sick stuff isn't that against the oath that doctors
[03:34.280 --> 03:41.680]  take I mean I'm already getting off on a jag but they banned Alex Jones on all
[03:41.680 --> 03:48.360]  the social media platforms yet I think that you could make the case that he's
[03:48.360 --> 03:55.960]  probably top three on social media and and doesn't the fact that he was
[03:55.960 --> 04:00.960]  trending yesterday above all of the other stuff that was breaking doesn't that
[04:00.960 --> 04:10.840]  prove it so it just shows you how committed these people are to censoring
[04:10.840 --> 04:20.720]  free speech and from stopping you from deciding for yourself stopping you from
[04:20.720 --> 04:27.880]  making up your own mind stopping you from getting the coverage that you want
[04:27.880 --> 04:37.920]  so I just thought that that was amazing and of course there is news breaking
[04:37.920 --> 04:42.960]  right now when it comes to the censorship that Facebook is engaged in we
[04:42.960 --> 04:48.120]  had James O'Keefe on yesterday we've got more video we're gonna air today is
[04:48.120 --> 04:53.360]  free speech dead in America folks well if they can censor Alex Jones then the
[04:53.360 --> 05:00.080]  answer is yes but this is the Alex Jones show and we'll be right back
[05:08.720 --> 05:15.080]  by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the
[05:15.080 --> 05:19.960]  world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with
[05:19.960 --> 05:24.960]  dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a
[05:24.960 --> 05:28.800]  quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects we
[05:28.800 --> 05:33.920]  have developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy energy
[05:33.920 --> 05:39.080]  drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's nothing else like it
[05:39.080 --> 05:43.640]  you must experience it it is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use
[05:43.640 --> 05:48.160]  packets to mix in fruit juice or water whatever you'd like warning though it's
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.000]  very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half pack at the first time you
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.480]  take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you
[05:55.480 --> 06:00.960]  into overdrive turbo force and in force live.com
[06:05.240 --> 06:14.680]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show and
[06:14.680 --> 06:24.160]  now your host Owen shroyer the stories on info wars.com ratings Alex Jones
[06:24.160 --> 06:31.480]  podcast more popular than Cohen hearing this is why they want Alex Jones
[06:31.480 --> 06:38.320]  censored and banned but strike me down now and I shall become more powerful than
[06:38.320 --> 06:49.960]  you ever imagined there is one thing I'm wondering why is Joe Rogan allowed to
[06:49.960 --> 06:57.440]  have Alex Jones on his podcast and why didn't YouTube censor it does this mean
[06:57.440 --> 07:02.200]  Alex Jones is loud back on YouTube does this mean Joe has exclusive privilege
[07:02.200 --> 07:10.640]  does this mean they're just gonna turn their head the other way but yes Alex
[07:10.640 --> 07:14.000]  was on the Joe Rogan experience yesterday and it was the number one trend on
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.240]  social media bigger than almost all out war between Pakistan and India bigger
[07:18.240 --> 07:23.080]  than the circus that was all hyped up and had the spotlight on it the Michael
[07:23.080 --> 07:27.960]  Cohen testimony bigger than the Trump Kim summit was Alex Jones on the Joe
[07:27.960 --> 07:34.560]  Rogan experience now look we highlight that because as they're trying to
[07:34.560 --> 07:39.840]  condense us and censor us it's just it's just nice to kind of get to stick
[07:39.840 --> 07:44.560]  your head out of the ground for once and look around and realize wow everybody's
[07:44.560 --> 07:51.600]  been looking for me and so it's like oh my gosh Alex Jones is back on YouTube
[07:51.600 --> 08:03.000]  everybody tunes in it peaked at two it was like 206,000 live audience with zero
[08:03.000 --> 08:11.160]  promotion zero we didn't promote it Rogan didn't promote it there were no
[08:11.160 --> 08:15.560]  graphics sent out there was no announcement made it was just fired up
[08:15.560 --> 08:24.920]  Alex Jones quarter million people tune in live now we'll see where this one
[08:24.920 --> 08:33.840]  ranks when it's all said and done I went and checked last night the Alex Jones
[08:33.840 --> 08:44.600]  Joe Rogan experience number 911 was number three on Rogan channel so we'll
[08:44.600 --> 08:49.880]  see where this one ends up when it's all said and done now this is just the
[08:49.880 --> 08:53.120]  YouTube channel we're talking about when I talk about all the people that add
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.480]  clips to Twitter and Facebook and their own YouTube channels or all the other
[08:58.480 --> 09:05.080]  places where the Rogan podcast is distributed I believe it's on iTunes so
[09:05.080 --> 09:15.760]  will iTunes ban that podcast because Alex Jones is on it very interesting
[09:15.760 --> 09:23.320]  stuff but it's weird that Alex is so popular and he has everybody talking
[09:23.320 --> 09:27.280]  about him yet he's able to just be totally erased off of the social media
[09:27.280 --> 09:35.640]  accounts how do they get away with that so we will be getting into some of that
[09:35.640 --> 09:40.000]  news and and there's other stuff that I haven't been able to get to that I'm
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.400]  gonna be able to get to today because we don't have many guests we do have
[09:43.400 --> 09:52.040]  Jacob wool coming on at 1130 central here in 20 minutes and he is having a
[09:52.040 --> 09:59.120]  press conference this afternoon he was in Minnesota with a team and Ali
[09:59.120 --> 10:04.000]  Alexander investigating Ilhan Omar they're now in DC with the team they're
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.960]  gonna have a press conference today announcing what they've discovered with
[10:08.960 --> 10:19.600]  Jack Berkman in their investigation into Ilhan Omar so Jacob wool will be
[10:19.600 --> 10:26.280]  joining us live to let us know where you can find that live stream and what
[10:26.280 --> 10:34.680]  exactly it is they were investigating it could go many ways but my guess is it's
[10:34.680 --> 10:43.560]  the documents of her marrying her brother that's just my guess that's not a
[10:43.560 --> 10:50.040]  tip or an inside information that's just my my guess Matt Bracken is gonna host
[10:50.040 --> 10:59.920]  the fourth hour and then I may just play the whole project Veritas video of the
[10:59.920 --> 11:04.480]  Facebook employee former employee talking about how they deboost
[11:04.480 --> 11:10.320]  conservatives well me they just erase Alex Jones they just erase info wars
[11:10.320 --> 11:21.000]  they just erase I'm honored thank you Facebook and I've been telling people
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.720]  about this for a long time but people are finally starting to do the deep
[11:26.720 --> 11:32.560]  research into it for themselves and so you're gonna find out what I have told
[11:32.560 --> 11:41.200]  you dozens of times here at info wars whenever CNN or MSNBC I don't know Fox
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.440]  News I've never seen any proof of it but I know they do it in MSNBC and CNN
[11:45.440 --> 11:51.280]  whenever they have a town hall the audience that you're seeing it's not all
[11:51.280 --> 11:53.760]  handpicked I mean they do have some people to get in there and they do have
[11:53.760 --> 11:58.200]  people from different sides but they handpick at least four people every time
[11:58.200 --> 12:04.000]  and give them a script and they're always right out of the Democrat Party and
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.760]  so finally people are starting to catch on to this and because of social media
[12:08.760 --> 12:14.360]  you can actually go find these people and so guess what they went and did
[12:14.360 --> 12:18.920]  research in the Bernie Sanders Town Hall this this this graphic is bad guys
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.000]  I'm sorry I should afford to do the tweet with all these images so that you
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.840]  could pull it up so that's my fault if you just search Bernie Sanders Town Hall
[12:26.840 --> 12:31.120]  like Democrat implants or something I'm sure you can find it it turns out that
[12:31.120 --> 12:37.600]  almost every person at the town hall featuring Bernie Sanders was a Democrat
[12:37.600 --> 12:47.920]  operative amazing amazing and they just take them they just oh okay here's this
[12:47.920 --> 12:53.720]  person and I don't know how these people do it it's like I mean the the
[12:53.720 --> 12:58.640]  Kekistan troll army on Reddit and 4chan like has mystical powers or
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.040]  something or access to something I've never seen or heard of because they
[13:03.040 --> 13:09.360]  find these people like in no time yeah there it is right there boom every
[13:09.360 --> 13:17.720]  single one of them a Democrat operative CNN does this every damn time CNN is the
[13:17.720 --> 13:26.120]  definition of fake news I mean these people suck all they want to do is
[13:26.120 --> 13:38.920]  deceive you that's all they want to do I can't even I it just it's I just wish
[13:38.920 --> 13:46.160]  people understood the levels the lengths that CNN goes to to deceive the
[13:46.160 --> 13:54.960]  public it's unbelievable so pull up the graphic again guys and just go through
[13:54.960 --> 14:01.400]  it I mean it because this this wakes this shocks people because you oh you know
[14:01.400 --> 14:06.040]  oh you're watching the town hall these are just regular Americans just like you
[14:06.040 --> 14:10.120]  and I they don't have an agenda they don't have a script no they do they
[14:10.120 --> 14:18.600]  literally do and so think about it if you're the producers at CNN and you're
[14:18.600 --> 14:22.520]  about to have a town hall and you're calling up all your Democrat operatives
[14:22.520 --> 14:25.840]  hey we got a town hall I need you asked this hey we got a town hall I need you
[14:25.840 --> 14:33.040]  asked this totally contrived totally manufactured nothing real nothing
[14:33.040 --> 14:40.640]  organic and then I got to give Bernie Sanders credit he did not win the
[14:40.640 --> 14:44.560]  nomination in 2016 he was never going to win it whether he realizes that or not
[14:44.560 --> 14:50.400]  I don't know I can't tell how dumb or dumb or smart the guy is but I do give
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.960]  him credit he got a haircut and he found a comb it was tough but I guess that
[14:55.960 --> 15:00.760]  means Bernie serious this time around last time he was just joking last time
[15:00.760 --> 15:03.800]  he was just in it to make a couple million bucks for himself get a new
[15:03.800 --> 15:12.960]  summer home get a new sports car but but this year this year yeah Bernie got
[15:12.960 --> 15:20.600]  the haircut he got the comb and he's even buttoning up his jacket so maybe
[15:20.600 --> 15:26.000]  Bernie Sanders is actually running to win this time boy wouldn't that be fun
[15:26.000 --> 15:37.360]  socialism versus capitalism 2020 yeah that's a that's a tough one right there
[15:37.360 --> 15:45.560]  socialism or capitalism folks which one do you want wow but don't worry because
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.440]  CNN will stack their town hall full of operatives to rig the whole thing and
[15:51.440 --> 15:56.280]  then make you think it's real because that's what CNN does total fake news
[15:56.280 --> 16:02.480]  we'll be right back pain in my neck back and shoulders has really gotten worse

[20:47.640 --> 20:52.680]  monument that you were waiting to see for an hour you're like oh where oh I
[20:52.680 --> 20:57.200]  was just driving down highway 70 where was that where was the arch like what we
[20:57.200 --> 21:07.200]  just passed the arch what and I realized so Jacob wool is going to be joining us
[21:07.200 --> 21:12.400]  in the next segment to make an announcement he's hosting a press
[21:12.400 --> 21:16.840]  conference later this afternoon he's going to talk to us about that and they
[21:16.840 --> 21:22.520]  went and they investigated Ilhan Omar and it just hit me the reason why they
[21:22.520 --> 21:31.400]  just ban Jacob wool is because he's about to out Ilhan Omar and so sometimes the
[21:31.400 --> 21:36.280]  answers are a lot simpler than we think because what are the two things right
[21:36.280 --> 21:40.520]  now on social media that will get you banned that well there's really we'll
[21:40.520 --> 21:44.840]  say the three main things using the phrase illegal immigration or talking
[21:44.840 --> 21:49.720]  about illegal immigration talking anything negative about Islam and then
[21:49.720 --> 21:58.160]  using the word trans or insulting trans in their view those are the three hot
[21:58.160 --> 22:09.160]  buttons right now so Jacob wool is going to investigate Ilhan Omar potentially
[22:09.160 --> 22:15.080]  marrying her brother illegally for a green card and they ban him on Twitter
[22:15.080 --> 22:18.560]  right before that he wasn't doing anything different than he ever does but
[22:18.560 --> 22:26.000]  see they know folks these you know it's like I have to tell people sometimes
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.440]  because they send me some personal stuff on Twitter messages and like hey don't
[22:31.440 --> 22:35.640]  realize we're not the only people reading these messages so you know be
[22:35.640 --> 22:44.480]  careful and you know that Twitter also has access to your camera your data your
[22:44.480 --> 22:53.200]  contacts your location oh yeah oh they all do go ahead and read the terms of
[22:53.200 --> 22:58.840]  service but I'm getting off track it's just because I just realized it's like
[22:58.840 --> 23:02.960]  they banned we all know that they banned Alex Jones because he was the big
[23:02.960 --> 23:07.120]  focal point in force is a big focal point we can change the narrative and so
[23:07.120 --> 23:13.520]  they they had to ban him too popular too powerful ban him then I was kind of
[23:13.520 --> 23:16.880]  still allowed to exist with the war room and then after we had all the
[23:16.880 --> 23:22.480]  exclusive Roger Stone coverage they banned the war room because you see
[23:22.480 --> 23:29.320]  that's not allowed to get out it's the same thing happening to Jacob he's
[23:29.320 --> 23:36.520]  investigating Ilhan Omar for whatever reason social media protects Muslims in
[23:36.520 --> 23:43.920]  this country actively or at least as far as content on social media is concerned
[23:43.920 --> 23:49.600]  so that might be the big reason now we'll find out from Jacob if he a agrees
[23:49.600 --> 23:56.000]  with that or B does have bombshell revelations coming this afternoon during
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.320]  the press conference now look in the middle of all this censorship we're
[23:59.320 --> 24:08.680]  forced to contract to the point that now it's just info wars comm slash show yes
[24:08.680 --> 24:12.440]  we exist on some other platforms out there I mean it's great bride on is
[24:12.440 --> 24:15.360]  out there it's great bit shoot is out there it's great these other places out
[24:15.360 --> 24:24.000]  there gab is out there but the traffic just isn't there and so info wars comm
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.200]  slash show is now the mothership where we have to drive all the traffic for our
[24:31.200 --> 24:37.560]  10 hours of live broadcast a day and it's not cheap to have all that bandwidth
[24:37.560 --> 24:44.000]  and have to have all this traffic coming here now and it also is basically
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.800]  like chopping off chopping off our arms and legs when it comes to being able to
[24:48.800 --> 24:53.200]  market ourselves expand our market reach and try to sell the products that we
[24:53.200 --> 25:00.120]  have at info wars store.com now thank God the info wars audience is loyal and

[33:25.840 --> 33:31.560]  and now your host Owen Troyer
[33:35.120 --> 33:44.560]  always on the troll all right Jacob Wool ladies and gentlemen had to reschedule
[33:44.560 --> 33:53.280]  no worries though he'll be joining us in 30 minutes from now to make the
[33:53.280 --> 33:59.000]  announcement or to tease what he's going to announce in his press conference
[33:59.000 --> 34:04.960]  as far as the investigation into Ilhan Omar marrying her brother is concerned
[34:04.960 --> 34:11.120]  and if you want the story on that you can go to jihadilhan.com that's jihad
[34:11.120 --> 34:20.000]  ilhan.com it's hosted by culture but that is the name of the site and you
[34:20.000 --> 34:27.760]  know it's sad that we have to send basically private investigators not
[34:27.760 --> 34:34.200]  official PIs but just citizen investigators to do these investigations
[34:34.200 --> 34:38.920]  because we get nothing from our government it's really a joke quite
[34:38.920 --> 34:42.680]  frankly but so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna cover some news in this
[34:42.680 --> 34:49.040]  segment in the next segment we're gonna be hearing from Alex Jones and he's
[34:49.040 --> 34:55.160]  gonna be responding to really the viral moment when he erupted over the fact
[34:55.160 --> 35:01.680]  the Democrats just say let that baby die so illegal I can't even really
[35:01.680 --> 35:06.360]  comprehend how this is happening quite frankly but that's the deal so that's
[35:06.360 --> 35:13.880]  what we have coming up and then I am going to my plan is to dedicate the
[35:13.880 --> 35:20.520]  entire third hour the entire one o'clock central hour to your phone calls I did
[35:20.520 --> 35:24.560]  not take enough phone calls yesterday on the war room and I know that the
[35:24.560 --> 35:29.000]  audience is chomping at the bit to respond to Alex Jones with Joe Rogan to
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.920]  respond to the Cohen testimony and to everything else that's going on right
[35:33.920 --> 35:39.080]  now so I'm planning on dedicating the entire one o'clock third hour to your
[35:39.080 --> 35:43.640]  phone calls we may even get to them before that but let me again just go
[35:43.640 --> 35:52.000]  through all of the news that I have here and then kind of lay the groundwork for
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.320]  where everything goes next now here were the big stories from yesterday the
[35:57.320 --> 36:04.600]  Trump Kim summit now apparently this deal did not go down and of course I'm
[36:04.600 --> 36:09.080]  gonna wait and see how it all shakes out and what the president's final
[36:09.080 --> 36:12.840]  comments are before I really decide whether this was a failure or not but
[36:12.840 --> 36:18.280]  today the headlines are saying it was not good yesterday headlines good today
[36:18.280 --> 36:24.840]  headlines not good but let's wait and see you had Pakistan and India almost get
[36:24.840 --> 36:30.680]  into a full-blown war and it almost barely really made the news airstrike
[36:30.680 --> 36:35.000]  airstrikes tanks heading to the border and planes shot down Indian Pakistan or
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.560]  in a state of war that's from Michael Snyder the AP this morning Pakistan
[36:38.560 --> 36:45.040]  pledges to release captive Indian fighter pilot to hopefully ease the tensions
[36:45.040 --> 36:52.200]  there then you had the Cohen testimony a big fat circus if you ask me a total
[36:52.200 --> 36:59.920]  Democrat deep state run event clearly and some of the highlights include
[36:59.920 --> 37:04.200]  Cohen hinting that the New York feds are probing Trump for undisclosed crimes
[37:04.200 --> 37:08.240]  folks you need to understand this is all hype if Trump if they had anything
[37:08.240 --> 37:12.120]  on Trump they'd already remove him from office they have nothing they have
[37:12.120 --> 37:18.680]  nothing oh and Cohen's afraid there won't be a peaceful transition of power see
[37:18.680 --> 37:22.200]  and then he also says that Trump behaves like a mobster so wait a second
[37:22.200 --> 37:27.280]  they're the ones Mueller's the one behaving like a mobster the Democrats are
[37:27.280 --> 37:33.680]  the ones behaving like a mobster go out and harass our enemies they're the ones
[37:33.680 --> 37:39.680]  that will not relinquish power it's the Democrats that lost power in the 2016
[37:39.680 --> 37:43.880]  election that are now resorting to violence do you see how they project
[37:43.880 --> 37:52.760]  everything they are it's almost I mean at this point I think there needs to be a
[37:52.760 --> 38:01.240]  new psychological issue here because this is this is there's pathological
[38:01.240 --> 38:06.600]  lying there's projection there's Stockholm syndrome there's all this stuff
[38:06.600 --> 38:13.520]  they it's like this is pathological projection that's what this is it's
[38:13.520 --> 38:19.320]  pathological perpetual projection not meaning to illiterate here but it's
[38:19.320 --> 38:26.040]  pathological perpetual projection they are constantly projecting who they are
[38:26.040 --> 38:32.800]  onto everyone else and it's perpetual it never stops and they believe it they
[38:32.800 --> 38:37.960]  can't even help themselves so pretty much anything you see from Democrats
[38:37.960 --> 38:44.200]  these days is them projecting Trump's a racist their racists Trump's gonna
[38:44.200 --> 38:49.880]  destroy the economy they want to destroy the economy Trump hates children they
[38:49.880 --> 39:00.360]  literally let babies die everything they do is projection but of course Alex
[39:00.360 --> 39:05.000]  Jones on the Joe Rogan podcast somehow topped all of it on social media yesterday
[39:05.000 --> 39:10.680]  I've already covered this but pull up the image again just because I'm telling
[39:10.680 --> 39:17.800]  you this is major major red pill territory right here and I know that most
[39:17.800 --> 39:22.720]  people no CNN is totally fake news even most people in the middle but when you
[39:22.720 --> 39:28.840]  actually see the fact that they plant all these people at these town halls you
[39:28.840 --> 39:33.160]  think you're having an organic event you think you're having a real event with
[39:33.160 --> 39:38.600]  real Americans asking real questions to real candidates it's all fake it's all
[39:38.600 --> 39:43.320]  fake the whole presentation is fake all the people that they have in these
[39:43.320 --> 39:48.120]  town halls are selected from Democrat and leftist activist groups ladies and
[39:48.120 --> 39:55.680]  gentlemen every damn time and this is the first time where I've really seen the
[39:55.680 --> 39:58.680]  internet pick this up and run with it because other people have done this
[39:58.680 --> 40:03.840]  before where they go and they find out who these people that CNN has on their
[40:03.840 --> 40:09.040]  town halls are and every time they find out they're damn Democrat donors every
[40:09.040 --> 40:15.480]  time and you know it's not quite like the issue you know what I'm not even
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.360]  gonna say it but you know it is odd how CNN interviews the same person multiple
[40:21.360 --> 40:27.800]  times at multiple different events but that's a separate issue that we're not
[40:27.800 --> 40:34.040]  allowed to talk about this is blatantly in your face and and to me the average
[40:34.040 --> 40:38.440]  American even that might not think CNN is that bad when you realize that CNN
[40:38.440 --> 40:43.680]  plants all their town hall participants when they select every single one of
[40:43.680 --> 40:48.240]  them from Democrat groups I mean if that doesn't show you how fake CNN actually
[40:48.240 --> 40:54.960]  is I don't know what will the whole thing is scripted folks but but I digress
[40:54.960 --> 41:00.560]  2020 Democrats are under pressure to embrace sweeping political reforms this
[41:00.560 --> 41:05.040]  is from a clashy so basically of all these people that are about to announce
[41:05.040 --> 41:10.480]  you know Biden probably or Rourke probably and they have to decide what
[41:10.480 --> 41:16.840]  they're going to do are you going to be going with the full-on socialist reform
[41:16.840 --> 41:21.440]  like Cortez and Sanders would like or are you going to retreat to real
[41:21.440 --> 41:27.800]  Americana and go back to actual jobs go back to actual issues and so the
[41:27.800 --> 41:33.600]  Democrats are kind of lost in no man's land right now how about this one though
[41:33.600 --> 41:38.120]  Dush challenges governor on police handling of illegal immigrants now that
[41:38.120 --> 41:43.080]  the original story broke early February and I just found it this morning the
[41:43.080 --> 41:50.320]  state of Pennsylvania has now made it a declaration basically that their state
[41:50.320 --> 41:56.160]  troopers are not allowed to enforce immigration law so if a state trooper
[41:56.160 --> 42:00.880]  pulls over an illegal immigrant they have to let him go literally I mean can
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.880]  you imagine if you got pulled over for a DUI do you get to be let go well if
[42:06.880 --> 42:13.080]  you're not a citizen yes so did you realize how ridiculous this so an area
[42:13.080 --> 42:17.000]  lawmaker said instructions given by the wolf administration to the state police
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.720]  of Pennsylvania forces our troopers to make Pennsylvania a de facto
[42:20.720 --> 42:26.040]  sanctuary state a statement that a spokesman for governor Tom Wolf was quick
[42:26.040 --> 42:34.320]  to dispute no no governor Wolf you made the declaration that state troopers are
[42:34.320 --> 42:37.880]  not allowed to enforce immigration law and if they have an illegal immigrant
[42:37.880 --> 42:42.320]  they're not allowed to do anything with it that was you so so I mean I've read
[42:42.320 --> 42:47.280]  the US code that's illegal you belong in jail the governor of Pennsylvania belongs
[42:47.280 --> 42:54.560]  in jail but don't expect that ladies and gentlemen don't expect any justice in
[42:54.560 --> 42:59.360]  this country don't you know we got Robert Muller running the show you know
[42:59.360 --> 43:03.560]  the worst part about getting old I'm still strong 45 is that I won't be there
[43:03.560 --> 43:07.220]  for my children someday that's why I need to make them strong now now I can be
[43:07.220 --> 43:11.760]  there for my children now I can make them strong now I can instruct them now
[43:11.760 --> 43:14.840]  I can teach them what I've learned but not once I'm gone you think of this
[43:14.840 --> 43:18.000]  digital age your words going forever but now there isn't better getting rid of
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.400]  what you said they were before it's so much easier to burn video or text or
[43:22.400 --> 43:26.640]  languages now that we have high tech book burning isn't it but I have joined
[43:26.640 --> 43:31.440]  my will to the resistance I can't be destroyed now as long as I realize I've
[43:31.440 --> 43:34.760]  done right and the longer the people know the truth and you can't be destroyed

[46:55.840 --> 46:59.080]  screw somebody over like one of these devil worshipers never enforce where
[46:59.080 --> 47:07.960]  I come you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:07.960 --> 47:35.080]  I've got a lot of hope for humanity and I'm gonna tell you why we know that the
[47:35.080 --> 47:40.240]  whole system works on compartmentalization and this dehumanization
[47:40.240 --> 47:45.880]  post-human project is rolling out its censorship its psychological
[47:45.880 --> 47:52.200]  manipulation because behind schedule it's it's it's ramped it up and
[47:52.200 --> 48:00.160]  accelerated it past what the controllers believe will actually work so you asked
[48:00.160 --> 48:04.520]  them are they doing it because we're beating them and so they're having to
[48:04.520 --> 48:12.240]  gamble and they are gambling that you're weak they're gambling that you're not
[48:12.240 --> 48:18.680]  gonna stay conscious and they're gambling that you're not able to
[48:18.680 --> 48:21.920]  differentiate all the different streams of data that are out there and the kind
[48:21.920 --> 48:29.000]  of fog or smoke screen that is being projected out there all the thousands of
[48:29.000 --> 48:34.040]  different voices all the millions of different pieces of disinformation so
[48:34.040 --> 48:38.240]  here's the really good news I've been friends with Joe Rogan for 20 years I
[48:38.240 --> 48:42.760]  got really mad at him and he does interview a lot of people and then you
[48:42.760 --> 48:45.160]  can make the connection to those people in the connection to him and say he's a
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.880]  bad guy but after I had a chance to talk to Joe and I'll talk more about this on
[48:49.880 --> 48:55.320]  the show later I understand what basically unfolded and what happened and
[48:55.320 --> 48:58.520]  we had a lot of private discussions last three weeks or so before I came on
[48:58.520 --> 49:04.400]  a show and most of that's private but the big thing was Joe was just caught up
[49:04.400 --> 49:10.080]  with his comedy and his podcast and all the other things he's doing in the UFC
[49:10.080 --> 49:14.560]  where he was working seven days a week the guy has a super work ethic I mean
[49:14.560 --> 49:21.960]  probably works more than I do and he just didn't want conflict and he just
[49:21.960 --> 49:26.440]  didn't want to be plugged into the fight against the loblas because that's not
[49:26.440 --> 49:32.080]  what he signed up for but things have gotten so bad and this whole crisis we've
[49:32.080 --> 49:38.080]  seen offensive ship forced him to not under my pressure to the right thing
[49:38.080 --> 49:42.480]  but forced him to pull back and reassess and I didn't just believe the
[49:42.480 --> 49:45.960]  things Joe told me I had actually been following what he was doing because I
[49:45.960 --> 49:49.480]  got real interested in it and trying to see whether he was a good guy or a bad
[49:49.480 --> 49:53.440]  guy and I and I saw him saying I'm cutting back on UFC I'm only gonna do
[49:53.440 --> 49:58.280]  major events not ESPN I'm I'm cutting back on other things you to spend time
[49:58.280 --> 50:03.080]  with my family and focus on the podcast so what he was telling me privately I
[50:03.080 --> 50:07.280]  was kind of cyber stalking him and was already saw him actually saying and
[50:07.280 --> 50:10.480]  doing his own life so I think if I did anything I kind of forced him to pull
[50:10.480 --> 50:16.840]  back and reassess what he was doing and he did apologize to me and then I felt
[50:16.840 --> 50:20.480]  guilty because I mean I went overboard Jesus didn't tell me to go after
[50:20.480 --> 50:25.400]  destroy your room I mean God the Holy Spirit does want me to wage war on the
[50:25.400 --> 50:34.240]  globalist and so and so by extension so by extension I was just labeling him the
[50:34.240 --> 50:36.320]  enemy
[50:37.240 --> 50:42.840]  so I'll break this down a moment now let me make the really big point this is a
[50:42.840 --> 50:51.280]  super good measure Joe did not know that they are keeping babies alive and
[50:51.280 --> 50:56.240]  harvesting their organs there in the US he didn't know that people like the
[50:56.240 --> 50:59.200]  governor of Virginia are trying to introduce after the public now because
[50:59.200 --> 51:03.840]  they know because of lawsuits under cover video it's coming out and it's such
[51:03.840 --> 51:08.040]  a huge crime hiding in plain view it will discredit the entire tyrannical
[51:08.040 --> 51:11.560]  medical system I'm not seeing all doctors are bad I'm talking about the
[51:11.560 --> 51:16.880]  administrators the system for the humanizing grid and so during the show
[51:16.880 --> 51:19.120]  and after the podcaster stay that's already on its way with the number one
[51:19.120 --> 51:24.640]  podcast in history Joe was completely freaked out by it was looking at it was
[51:24.640 --> 51:30.400]  talking about it we went to dinner for like two hours and he's totally flip
[51:30.400 --> 51:36.400]  his paradigm even more than how real all this is and again when I told you
[51:36.400 --> 51:41.920]  about human animal clones he looked it up and found on MIT he really didn't know
[51:41.920 --> 51:47.160]  all that he's a smart guy it was I was seeing him go through the same kind of
[51:47.160 --> 51:50.680]  awakening that we've all gone through and then he was talking about well then
[51:50.680 --> 51:54.400]  how do we take action because he understands he's got kids you can't
[51:54.400 --> 51:59.120]  just ignore this stuff and have it go away it's so bad that it makes you take
[51:59.120 --> 52:03.640]  action against it so it hit me this morning I woke up like 5 a.m. about to
[52:03.640 --> 52:10.520]  fly back to Texas we're at the airport as you hear and it just hit me how big
[52:10.520 --> 52:13.960]  the stakes are that I was thinking about other wars I was thinking about other
[52:13.960 --> 52:19.200]  things humanities gone through and I was thinking you know this is a war that I
[52:19.200 --> 52:22.960]  was talking a few hours later the producer of the show Daria and we were
[52:22.960 --> 52:26.360]  talking about how this really is a full spectrum war we're not just saying we're
[52:26.360 --> 52:31.360]  in a war when you realize that you said well who are the combatants they're
[52:31.360 --> 52:39.400]  unborn babies and now because they sold us on that now it's babies that have
[52:39.400 --> 52:44.000]  been born and we've seen all the case for killing granny and Newsweek and time
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.800]  and now they're wanting us to euthanize old people and we're literally being
[52:47.800 --> 52:52.720]  taught that we're just human resources and that we're crap and once we do
[52:52.720 --> 52:55.280]  humanize old people then it's unborn babies now it's babies after they're
[52:55.280 --> 52:59.680]  already born and everybody's sitting back going how is this possible it's
[52:59.680 --> 53:03.280]  illegal to kill a baby that's already born but that's why the governor is a
[53:03.280 --> 53:09.800]  medical doctor an organ harvester that's why he said oh we resuscitate the
[53:09.800 --> 53:13.520]  mother wants to keep it the baby's alive they're not considering it alive
[53:13.520 --> 53:18.200]  though they as a bioethics board playing God they wave a magic wand and say we
[53:18.200 --> 53:23.920]  resuscitate and then we're now saying wave a magic wand by the bioethics board
[53:23.920 --> 53:28.640]  you have life that's how they work and this is where doctors become gods that's
[53:28.640 --> 53:31.840]  why about 20 years ago they got rid of the credit goes in Europe they got over
[53:31.840 --> 53:35.600]  here 15 years ago in medical schools of apocryptics where you say do no harm
[53:35.600 --> 53:41.980]  they are literally now at the top a death cult teaching us all this and our
[53:41.980 --> 53:44.960]  babies that are already born you know I was sitting there talking one of my
[53:44.960 --> 53:49.280]  security guys at breakfast I said listen I'm not calling for people to go in and
[53:49.280 --> 53:53.120]  shoot up abortion clinics because that only turns them into the victims sure
[53:53.120 --> 53:55.520]  they're killing babies in there but their own weird world they're saying
[53:55.520 --> 54:03.520]  they're not but I said what happens what happens when when when people learn
[54:03.520 --> 54:07.280]  that they're killing babies as they're born they're totally healthy this is
[54:07.280 --> 54:11.760]  beyond eugenics this is just just taking their organs what's gonna happen if
[54:11.760 --> 54:15.200]  somebody goes after those folks and then they're on trial and the jury's hearing
[54:15.200 --> 54:20.040]  how it's an already born baby see see how that works so it's okay to kill the
[54:20.040 --> 54:25.280]  babies it's okay to kill the baby so it's okay to kill babies but if I even
[54:25.280 --> 54:29.080]  talk about somebody attacking an abortion clinic and say I don't even want
[54:29.080 --> 54:32.760]  to happen still take who that's human life don't even discuss someone taking
[54:32.760 --> 54:39.240]  action and I was talking my friend and he goes yeah well that's already happened
[54:39.240 --> 54:42.960]  and you know the courts the rule that wasn't right because you know the kids
[54:42.960 --> 54:47.520]  weren't human I said I know because they weren't born yet he goes oh yeah and see
[54:47.520 --> 54:52.080]  the slide again now it's already born New York's passed the law other states
[54:52.080 --> 54:56.320]  who passed the law and now because people are so taken back because it's over
[54:56.320 --> 54:59.760]  the top we're hit by something so out of control so evil we don't even know how
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.800]  to respond I mean it was Hitler that killed already born babies it was Hitler
[55:04.800 --> 55:08.680]  that put eugenics in place and would decide who lived and who died that's how
[55:08.680 --> 55:13.760]  this starts that's where this comes from that's what this is and and that's what
[55:13.760 --> 55:19.200]  we're paid so the answer is not to go out and be violent but the answer is to get
[55:19.200 --> 55:24.320]  super aggressive with information and truth because the enemy's making their
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.080]  move right now and they need radio silence they need us to not communicate
[55:28.080 --> 55:31.040]  and then they can try to condition everyone that to accept the new normal
[55:31.040 --> 55:34.520]  that we're all just a bunch of meat to the corporate establishment like
[55:34.520 --> 55:39.000]  communist China but no that's not gonna happen our humanity is coming back and
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.680]  even people out here in the middle of evil LA are having huge awakenings and
[55:42.680 --> 55:46.760]  choosing what side they're on because they're being challenged and they're
[55:46.760 --> 55:50.360]  being educated they're being informed so whether it's in person or there's
[55:50.360 --> 55:54.000]  calling to talk radio whether speaking at your church whether it's talking to

[56:50.040 --> 56:56.760]  damage to their product there and so now they just say oh that baby was born
[56:56.760 --> 57:01.840]  yeah just don't give it any treatment just let it die it'll be in perfect
[57:01.840 --> 57:07.200]  condition when we want to harvest its organs and harvest its blood and you

[57:35.520 --> 57:41.520]  just let babies die then you're not going to the next level with me if you

[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.960]  requesting comment on us spreading wild conspiracy theories about Democrats
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:30.200]  letting babies die and harvesting their organs why don't you go ahead and put
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:35.000]  the video of Ralph Ralph Northam talking about how they'll reset to
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  resuscitate the baby and then decide that's that's them saying and then let it
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.240]  die deciding to let it die and then why don't you also upload the video
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:50.280]  undercover tape which was just ruled in the court it was all real not doctored
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:55.480]  not edited Planned Parenthood doctors talking about selling baby parts so they
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:03.800]  can buy Ferraris and then this just came out today I mean just today Planned
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.200]  Parenthood doctors said she would break the baby's neck if born alive after
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:15.640]  abortion oh Newsweek oh I'll tell you what Newsweek go ahead and publish my

[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:55.640]  there's your comment Newsweek right there go ahead and look it up for yourself
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:03.280]  folks it's all real yeah you don't want to believe it because we're supposed to
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:08.120]  be we're supposed to be the most advanced civilization of all time right we
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.280]  don't engage in human sacrifice that's for the ancients no we're still doing it
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:19.240]  and there's a sick twisted mentality at the top they'll never admit to this but
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:25.080]  it's all about depopulation and I had another great revelation and I'll get to
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.520]  this later about why Bill Maher says that Middle America wishes they lived on
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:35.000]  the coast it's literally the exact opposite all of these progressive liberals
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.920]  that live in these hellholes that they've that they've created they are the
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.800]  ones that are jealous of Middle America they're the ones jealous of Middle
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.800]  America's lifestyle they're the one jealous of us having strong families
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:50.400]  that's them and and then they want to act like they're high and mighty and
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:54.760]  deny that there's any baby organs organ harvesting going on even though they
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:05:03.520]  know it's true this bar at its regular price is a little over $3 when we have
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:10.320]  it discounted it's about $2.50 a piece comparable bars between $5 and $7 a
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:15.920]  piece at Whole Foods this is high-end when you get one box you get them at
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.160]  basically $3 you get them for $2.50 or so when you get it the current launch
[01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:25.080]  discount this took over a year to get the top manufacturer developer in the
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.480]  country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.640]  make this it's available exclusively in fourslife.com it's simple you get the
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:37.880]  highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.120]  against the globalist and the attempt that we're engaged in to take the country
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:45.520]  back it's simple go shop with the good guys in four store.com and break the back
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.440]  of the globalist and get high quality super discounts or keep shopping with
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:53.120]  Jeff Bezos and Amazon and keep going to Whole Foods that are actually funding
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:56.480]  the Washington Post and the globalist to destroy this country it's that simple
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:17.440]  in fourslife.com you found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer ladies and gentlemen when the
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:23.480]  government doesn't do its job sometimes it's upon us to do it for ourselves and
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:28.440]  sometimes it may feel or seem fruitless but as I've said even the smallest
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:33.920]  actions can have the biggest effects now Jacob Wool got banned from Twitter
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:39.360]  about 48 hours ago and then we were all kind of we've been lulled into this
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:42.920]  comfort zone where yes we're all just getting banned for our political speech
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:48.360]  but there's actually a next level to this they banned Jacob Wool and they
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:52.040]  chose this moment because he's about to expose Ilhan Omar ladies and gentlemen
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:55.840]  that's the truth here now Jacob has a press conference coming up later this
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:07:02.480]  afternoon but he joins us now Jacob first just just tell the audience why
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:08.400]  you went up to Minnesota and what people can expect from your press conference
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:14.040]  this afternoon well Owen we put on a petition to remove Ilhan Omar she's
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:18.200]  made anti-Semitic remarks but that's the least of the concern she's made anti
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.760]  American remarks anti-Christian remarks just about everything you can imagine
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:27.280]  besides Islamists who she seems to love she speaks to Islamic relief she's
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:32.280]  backed by care she supported Hezbollah she called for ISIS terrorists to receive
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.280]  a more lenient sentence in a terror case wrote a personal letter and served as
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:40.680]  their character witness in a case so she is a terror sympathizer she's an
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:45.440]  anti-Semite she's anti-American and 200,000 Americans almost as many as
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.840]  voted for her agreed with us so we said we got to do something about this we put
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:54.160]  out fundraising emails we put out periscopes we crowd sourced an operation
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.640]  and we brought a 12 man team of military former military intelligence guys
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.480]  Laura Loomer the one of the top investigative journalists in the
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.720]  country myself who does this in a political and corporate realm and
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:08.240]  several others Ali Alexander who's on the show frequently and we went up to
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:12.520]  Minnesota and we just treated this like you know what the DHS isn't going to do
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:15.320]  their job the FBI is not going to do their job here so we're going to have to
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:19.080]  do it for him and we went on the ground and with the intent of figuring out
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:23.240]  did oh did Ilhan Omar marry her brother in other words she admitted to marrying
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:27.960]  this Elmi character the question became is that her brother so we went there we
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.440]  interviewed human sources we made it happen and today at 3 p.m. we're going
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:36.960]  to present our findings and a very meticulous dossier at the Gaylord at
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.120]  CPAC so it's going to be fantastic wow so there's gonna be a huge audience for
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:48.080]  this and the information is at jihad Ilhan dot com folks and I imagine that
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:50.840]  that's where people can also find the live streams where can they find the
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:54.720]  live streams of this press conference well it's I know it's gonna be on
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:58.560]  right-side broadcasting network RSBN and I'm sure you guys are free to take the
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.760]  stream as well for folks that are watching info wars I need to have to talk
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:04.680]  to them about that but and I'm sure it'll be on a variety of periscopes
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.320]  otherwise but I'd support right side if you're gonna watch something and don't
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.520]  watch one of these lefties periscopes because they're all there all the fake
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.880]  news journalists and they're gonna try to be tossing this thing down but we're
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.600]  gonna be right there in the main lobby at CPAC we'll lead a massive press
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.480]  conference and we're going to go over the facts and the Democrats are gonna
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:27.080]  have to decide either yes Ilhan Omar married her brother in a fraudulent
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:31.840]  scheme against the United States and so she has to resign or yes she did that but
[01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.120]  we're okay with it that's the only choice left they're going to have from a
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.640]  messaging standpoint after we present our findings and I have confirmed we will
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.040]  be airing your press conference here on the Alex Jones show folks so we will be
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.080]  carrying that as well and you know just to take a step back from this Jacob
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.360]  because you're going to be revealing really the gruesome details of this
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:56.200]  during the press conference but but just to take a step back the Democrats which
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:01.200]  were never officially you know involved with the women's March I mean yes
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.600]  obviously they were involved you know through people speaking and the
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:08.120]  political agenda everything but like as far as directly funding or doing any
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.160]  sort of you know fundraising they were never really involved in that well this
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.640]  year the DNC came out and made a statement disavowing the women's March
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.680]  for its anti-Semitism now obviously that involves Linda Sarsour and and her
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:26.880]  anti-Semitic remarks and her hate for America and Israel but what I'm a little
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.960]  perturbed at here it just shows you how the Democrats they can't even think in
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:34.000]  in multiple layers or multiple dimensions it's just like they can only
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.160]  think on one path it's like in a little box it's like uh-oh here's Linda Sarsour
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:42.440]  clearly anti-Semitic hate Israel we need to make a statement about this there's a
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.960]  lot of Jewish Americans that vote for us so we disavow the DNC says we disavow
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.880]  the Democrats disavow the women's March for its anti-Semitism but wait a second
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.120]  if they're gonna disavow the women's March for its anti-Semitism how come
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:11:02.200]  they haven't disavowed Ilhan Omar yeah exactly I mean she is as anti-Semitic
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:07.080]  as they come she could be a featured speaker at at a Hezbollah event and
[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.600]  she's refused to disavow that group by the way and she I mean look just last
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.680]  Saturday just last Saturday while we were in Minnesota in fact she flew down
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.240]  to Tampa for the night and she spoke to a group called Islamic Relief that's
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:23.920]  been sanctioned as a material supporter of terrorism namely groups like ISIS and
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.800]  Hamas alongside a gentleman or let's not call them a gentleman alongside an
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:33.200]  animal who has called for all Jews to be genocided speaks right alongside him
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:39.480]  featured speakers list you know but nobody's calling him Hitler no no Trump's
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.800]  the bad guy who's got you know Jewish grandchildren Jewish children you name it
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:49.680]  he's the Hitler was on Michael Savage yesterday he said Trump is basically
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:54.840]  Jewish yeah I agree I called him the first Jewish president the first giant
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.480]  Zionist president however people want to put it and of course when you expose
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.320]  Ilhan Omar this is now a pattern Laura Loomer comes out with bombshell
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:07.300]  reporting against Ilhan banned from Twitter after care lobbies them Jacob
[01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:10.880]  Engels who I know has been on this network worked on stop the steal works
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:15.600]  with Roger Stone you know Jacob Engels goes out and reports on Ilhan Omar
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:20.040]  banned just this last week and now myself and I was expecting this I knew
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.160]  this would happen and I told everybody they're gonna take me out of Twitter it's
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:27.200]  a matter of time but I'm gonna go out with a bang so what my last tweet was
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.320]  announcing these findings that are coming out Thursday coming out today at
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.920]  3 p.m. now and they banned me about two hours later and made up some excuse that
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.880]  I've run fake accounts I've only ran one account ever that wasn't you know an
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.640]  officially sanctioned individual or company account it was an experiment
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.880]  account to see how people would support Howard Schultz so this whole idea of
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.840]  running fake accounts it's just insanity they banned me because care lobbied
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.920]  them well that's just the whole thing they I've learned this I talked about
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.680]  this earlier that the left right now is engaged in a next next level of mental
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:05.480]  illness it's it's it's pathological perpetual projection and so here's
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.120]  thing as if first of all as if you creating some side account is even some
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:12.680]  big deal it's like okay I want to have an anonymous account or I want to have you
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.400]  know this account for posting this or whatever a ton of people do that it's
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.800]  perfectly normal AOC's got 600,000 bucks but that's my point they're the one
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:24.960]  that actually make fake accounts like they're the ones that actually do the
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.520]  whole botnet I mean they even admitted it during the Alabama race for the
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:33.280]  special election they're like oh oh we tested all of these bots to see how they
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.520]  would influence the election wait a second you're the ones complaining about
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:40.120]  it so they're that's just them perpetually projecting again they're the
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.680]  ones that have the fake accounts they're the ones that have all these fake
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.200]  followers and and they've actually learned something and I just figured this
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:50.560]  out I don't know what you know about this they've now figured out how to how to
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:55.880]  algorithm these bots into making it appear to be real now so when you audit
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.120]  their Twitter accounts they don't actually show up so they've got it all
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.400]  figured out they've mastered the art of fake Twitter accounts and then they have
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.160]  they have and I'm going to be exposing probably this next I've got this in
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.480]  motion but they've got right here in DC where I'm sitting down the street
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:18.680]  multiple floors and multi-million dollar operations that make the Internet
[01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:24.280]  research agency look like a couple of buffoons so this this the Democrats
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.800]  have botnets galore they needed an excuse to ban me so they took one out of
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.280]  context quote from a USA Today article about me and said sorry we had to get
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.280]  rid of Jacob we know the reality Tara lobbied them just like you do with
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.800]  Loomer they won't admit this but I'll figure it out and expose it one way or
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.640]  the other Tara lobbied them just like they lobby in every other case but you
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:43.760]  know what I get it Tara has invested millions of dollars of resources into
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.800]  Ilhan Omar and other people like her and now I'm about to make their investment
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.520]  fill up in smoke with this dossier with these findings with this
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.920]  investigation so I understand why they want to stop me I understand why they
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:59.680]  had private investigators care you know private investigators following us
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.600]  around in Minnesota that's fine but we're not gonna stop and just so they
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:06.400]  know if they try anything the reports coming out one way or the other it'll
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.320]  be dropped we've got a dead man switched on this thing so they're not gonna stop
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:14.000]  it now you know I gotta say you know Jacob I don't know how old you are I
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:20.200]  believe you're in your your young 20s right I'm 21 I gotta say folks look you
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.600]  know there's a lot of times where we can feel bad about America and and feel like
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:29.040]  the future is you know is not looking good and desperate but you know we have
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:32.600]  to be patient and realize the bigger picture here because folks let me tell
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:35.680]  you something when I was Jacob's age and you can see the talent in the drive I
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:40.000]  was in sports media and that's everything I wanted to do America is

[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:18.000]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:21.840]  iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.600]  us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.240]  nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:34.720]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:39.280]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemist scientists and others showed
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:43.440]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:50.200]  iodine and vitamin C it super charges it and makes it even more bio available
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.560]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:20:02.360]  incredible discovery x3 now available at enforce live com you're listening to
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:18.800]  the alex jones show
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:25.280]  they don't want you to know who illhan Omar really is and truth be told
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:30.000]  ladies and gentlemen the bigger picture here if you don't want to get into the
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.480]  identity politics and stuff which is not what I mean the point is that
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:41.600]  illhan Omar is now in Congress and is a total disruptor obstructionist
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:46.880]  anti-american who just wants to get in and literally destroy the fabric of
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.920]  America folks that's what this is all about there's a deep intense hatred of
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:55.960]  America amongst folks like illhan Omar okay and so whether she's wearing a
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:21:00.560]  hijab or marrying her brother or not the woman hates this country and
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.920]  fundamentally wants to change it and that's why on the cover of Rolling
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:09.680]  Stone you have the feature the women shaping America's future really a woman
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:14.360]  in a hijab the symbol of women's oppression Nancy Pelosi who can't even
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.840]  who can't even think her way out of a cardboard box a corrupt politician
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:25.000]  alexandra Cortez who in the next 20 years wants to bulldoze all sky scrapers
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.800]  and wants to eliminate air travel oh that's the future of America no that's
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:36.200]  a dystopian hellhole but that's what they're pushing that's who they really
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:41.280]  are and anyone exposing that gets censored like my guest Jacob wool so
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:46.280]  again Jacob major press conference coming up this afternoon we're gonna
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:51.280]  carry it here on the alex joneshow just again tell people what they can expect
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.320]  during this press conference what time it's at and and what motivated your
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:59.720]  whole investigation we put together a boots on the ground investigation
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:05.040]  because we couldn't continue to see a situation where on Saturday this
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:08.680]  congresswoman goes and speaks next to a guy who calls for kill genociding Jews
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:13.400]  and destroying America and on Monday she gets a classified briefing remember
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:16.760]  folks she's on the foreign affairs committee she gets briefed by the three
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:21.000]  letter agencies meanwhile she's called for abolishing DHS well we're about to
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.160]  show reason why she might want to abolish DHS and abolish ICE because she
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:32.120]  engaged in a fraudulent immigration scheme an illegal one a felony multiple
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.840]  felonies with her own brother married her own brother legally speaking we've
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.120]  got her dead to rights that's what we're gonna prove at 3 p.m. Eastern 12
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:45.600]  pacific and hopefully this leads the Democrats to at least I want her off of
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:48.240]  the foreign affairs committee this afternoon I don't want her getting
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:53.080]  another classified briefing I don't want her interrogating another foreign
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:57.280]  foreign affairs official like Elliot Abrams this is out of control you've
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.360]  got somebody who's called for abolishing ICE abolishing DHS and say
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.280]  whatever you want about DHS they've done some bad things and you guys have
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.520]  covered them and I've talked about him but overall I think of DHS as the last
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:13.080]  line of defense let's actually bear down on this for a second because this
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:17.440]  is actually key let's look we don't take things at face value here but let's
[01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.800]  actually take things at face value because that's where most the
[01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:24.480]  population is at here and so if you just take let's just take things at face
[01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:30.200]  value and logically parse them out here okay we were told face value here again
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.980]  September 11th 2001 radical Islamic terrorists engaged in the biggest
[01:23:35.980 --> 01:23:41.840]  terror act on this country's homeland ever 3,000 Americans died that day tens
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:45.400]  of thousands of Americans have died since in the aftermath okay now we're
[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.960]  told that this is from radical Islamic terror we went to war against radical
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:53.680]  Islamic terror and as far as we're concerned we're still at war with
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:59.680]  radical Islamic terror now here's Ilhan Omar which I think you can say is
[01:23:59.680 --> 01:24:03.520]  definitely I mean she's an Islamist whether you want to call her radical or
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.200]  not I guess that's your own opinion but here she is we're still in a war against
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:16.000]  radical Islam and here she is saying she wants to abolish DHS again if you just
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:21.360]  take that at face value how is that not considered a terrorist threat when we're
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.120]  at war with radical Islam Islamic terrorists here's an Islamist saying I
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:31.680]  want to eliminate America's last line of defense I mean again at face value how
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:37.640]  does America not look at that and say hmm something's doesn't add up here yeah
[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:42.160]  exactly and some of calls for abolishing ice she calls for abolishing the entire
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:46.520]  Department of Homeland Security that means TSA that means the folks at the
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:51.360]  ports that make sure people aren't shipping in a cesium 137 or radiological
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.680]  material she wants to abolish the whole thing and open up America to unlimited
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:59.280]  terror attacks and I can tell you having brought military intel guys with me
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:05.600]  having dealt with FBI sources both there and other places you will both DHS
[01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.040]  you're going to see a wave of terror attacks across the country they stopped
[01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:12.560]  terror attacks left and right you don't hear about it in the news you don't read
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:17.040]  about it but Ilhan Omar who gets classified briefings and does hear about
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:21.680]  this stuff as a part of those classified briefings says you know what DHS just
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:27.040]  foiled 14 terror attacks in the past 12 months I know let's abolish DHS that is
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.760]  subversive anti-American behavior and and it's got to be stopped she has got to
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:35.000]  be removed from that committee and she has got to be removed from Congress you
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.880]  cannot have somebody like that in the halls of power in this country
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:44.040]  unacceptable well and now you had the story out of bright part today travel
[01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:48.160]  ban ends nearly all immigration from terrorist sanctioned nations and then
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.960]  they actually have the the studies and the numbers in here with the data that
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:55.800]  basically the travel ban does work it stops terrorists from coming here and
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:59.720]  again they want to sit here and pin this thing on Trump the list was actually
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.960]  created by Obama these are just the eight countries Obama was bombing while
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.560]  he was in office so it's like wow yeah we were just bombing your country for
[01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:09.680]  eight years you don't think they might want to try to sneak someone in here to
[01:26:09.680 --> 01:26:12.880]  kill Americans of course they would that's why we have this travel ban
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:18.000]  that's why Trump resigned it and so it's like yeah here's the data when we
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.400]  actually do our due diligence and try to stop terrorists from coming in we can
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:26.120]  maybe stop terrorism or at least quell it and then here's Ilhan Omar who's
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.800]  trying to stop that whole process why isn't America asking why so again
[01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:34.320]  Jacob Wool he is hosting a press conference this afternoon folks and he's
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.160]  breaking down his research into Ilhan Omar but but we're kind of going beyond
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.040]  the pale here you're just getting you're trying to get a foot in the door for
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:46.760]  people's attention and just say hey look we just investigated this woman did she
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.560]  marry her brother are you going to accept that are we going to accept that or
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:53.640]  are we gonna do something about it or are you and so basically you're putting
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:56.880]  the Democrats in a position where they have to make a decision on Ilhan Omar
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:01.640]  either you're going to accept her anti-Semitism and her and her felonious
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:07.560]  behavior or you're gonna deny it that that's exactly right this woman is a
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:11.880]  felon she's a terrorist sympathizer she's an anti-Semite she's an anti-American
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.160]  and she has absolutely got to be removed from Congress and you know it's
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:20.680]  striking the way that the mainstream media quashed this story it was clear I
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:24.920]  mean even Snopes who would normally call this an anti-Islamic conspiracy theory
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.800]  says the claim that she married her brother is unverified well not after
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:32.120]  this afternoon at 3 p.m. at the Gaylord Plaza and CPAC but they will have to
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.720]  now say confirmed but they even say unverified in their leftist probably a
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:41.760]  CIA operation so even they admit that she probably married her brother but when
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:44.920]  they asked her when the Associated Press you know the far-right
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:50.400]  Associated Press asked her for a list of her siblings she refused to provide it
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:55.160]  and they said you know what that works for us story closed she refused to
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:01.000]  provide a list of her siblings it's remarkable it's uncanny well this is
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.320]  huge and I and again folks we're gonna be covering the press conference and
[01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:10.880]  again Jacob I just say it because you know people it's just like everybody
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:15.400]  has a role out there and I just I'm just so inspired by the role that you're
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.680]  playing the role that Ali is playing the role that's sort of it I mean
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:22.120]  everybody and it's like people want to sit here and in fight is like it's like
[01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:25.640]  I've also as long as we're all punching the same enemy and we all have the true
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.440]  same motivation which is just have freedom and prosperity in the West and

[01:32:54.360 --> 01:33:05.320]  store you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:16.000]  we now take you live to the central texas commenced over in the heart of the
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:29.360]  resistance and now your host
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:37.320]  trying to figure out where I want to go from here as new information is
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:49.200]  continuing to come in sometimes there's anomalies or glitches in the matrix
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:34:00.840]  where I think I think that it's like this weird thing where everyone is moving
[01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:08.000]  digital and so then you have this comfort level with digital activism but
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:12.200]  now that they're censoring digital activism and even eliminating digital
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.760]  activism it's like forcing us into the real world which is actually the
[01:34:16.760 --> 01:34:24.160]  solution so it's like they're actually giving us the solution to the problems
[01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:32.160]  that they're causing I mean it's like because I started the info wars army
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.400]  immediately after they banned alex jones off everything and now the info wars
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:41.920]  army is basically its own like living breathing operating body of people that
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:45.800]  go out and do street activism and and link up with fellow info warriors then
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:52.320]  we have the info comms which blows up now info comms.org we're info warriors
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:58.440]  go and communicate and organize events and that was all because they banned us
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:03.760]  off the digital platform and then you look at jaco bull they banned him on
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:09.680]  Twitter doesn't stop him he goes out into the physical world and engages in
[01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:15.920]  activism engages in investigation so it's like they had us they had us in their
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:22.240]  web like us like a spider has us in its in its web but because we were seeing
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:27.640]  there in the web warning all the other flies buzzing around hey don't get caught
[01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:32.520]  in this web they were like okay crap we got a release we got to release this one
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:36.840]  from our web it's it's it's too smart it's telling the other people were trying
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.440]  to catch about us so it then releases us and then we just go out into the real
[01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:49.640]  world and we're just buzzing around out there now so I just I'm telling you I
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:55.400]  can't quite put my finger on it yet but we're really in the midst of a cultural
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:00.520]  sea change and and I think the reason why I can't put my finger on it yet is
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:04.720]  because I don't know where it ends and that's because I don't even think where
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:11.080]  it ends exists yet we're still building where it ends we're still designing
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:20.760]  where it ends we're still figuring out where it ends but it doesn't end it
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:25.920]  doesn't end the way the globalist wanted to go because there's one thing
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:33.680]  about people in the West even the average uninformed individual they're
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:42.560]  fighters they're fighters and even now even even in this digital brainwashed
[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:54.200]  age those instincts will still kick in the gear and it'll be just the flood
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:37:00.280]  gates will open and it'll just be a rush and it's the old saying I can never
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:06.520]  quoted exactly but it's like nobody wants to be a patriot when the patriot is
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:10.000]  you know a scorned man but when the price of being a patriot is you know
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.040]  cheap everyone's a patriot I'm totally butchering the quote I don't know what
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:22.240]  it is but that's like where we're at because see once you've had everything
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:29.040]  once you've had everything taken from you you have no choice but to fight you
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:34.320]  see how that works and then once you realize that you'll have nothing left
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:42.040]  you have no choice but to fight and it's the old psychology you're not even
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:46.160]  thinking about any of this stuff you don't care about any of this stuff until
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:49.960]  it comes to your front door and it's coming to more and more Americans front
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:57.160]  doors and again I just look at a Jacob wall 21 years old when I was 21 man I
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:02.040]  thought I was so cool I was hanging out with professional athletes and I was on
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:07.440]  NFL football fields and you know in baseball clubhouses and locker rooms
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:13.480]  there so oh boy I'm so cool look at me what did that do for anybody nothing
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:22.040]  sure it's cool but but what I'm seeing is more and more Americans are learning
[01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:27.160]  and finding out it's cool to actually try to change the world it's cool to
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:31.400]  actually engage in something that's fulfilling substantial and has a
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:39.120]  lasting impact so that's that's the knob that's turning right now the heat is
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:45.040]  being turned up right now and once it reaches a certain degree American
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:50.720]  patriots like popcorn just start exploding out of the woodwork and so they
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.200]  want to chill free speech they want to chill the Second Amendment they want to
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:58.320]  chill our ability to communicate because they want to turn that heat down they
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:05.480]  don't want those kernels turning into popcorn but it's inevitable folks because
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:12.920]  it was already designed by God billions of years ago and it's probably already
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:19.480]  happened billions of times over so we're just sitting here ancient technology
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:26.040]  created by God experiencing this consciousness and you have people that
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:30.720]  think that they're in control it's kind of like how AOC and these Democrats
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.120]  think that they can control the climate you think you're more powerful than the
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:43.360]  Sun talk about the arrogance and it's the same thing you think you're more
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:48.760]  powerful than the the being the entity whatever it is that created all of this
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:40:01.720]  it's really outrageous truly mental illness and that is what it is if you
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:05.600]  think that you can control the climate or you have more of an impact on the
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:13.720]  climate than the Sun you're a lunatic if you really think you can control
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:22.040]  humanity and dictate everything on earth you're insane but it's an age-old
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:30.520]  story like I said played out billions of times over now I need to fuel our
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:34.480]  engines here at info wars you know about the censorship we're engaged in or
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.480]  that we're being engaged against us we're not allowed to exist on social media

[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.280]  brand broadcast in the West we just become the dark night and people that

[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.160]  go check us out an info store.com we hope that's the process but it does
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:04.840]  limit our availability to expand which is the sad truth but we're

[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:06.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:31.280]  you know my only regret here is that I just don't have enough time to get to
[01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:38.720]  all the content that we have I mean I want to play the whole project
[01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:42.200]  veritas video I simply won't have time because I promised and and we need to
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.360]  take your calls I mean I love hearing from the audience I know you want to
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:48.280]  react to everything that happened yesterday so I'm gonna open up the
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:51.520]  phone lines we're gonna I'm gonna dedicate the next hour to your phone
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:55.600]  call so that just means I'm preempting all of the clips from the Cohen
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:59.280]  testimony yesterday which is fine I mean you know what the deal is but there's
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.840]  powerful stuff in there quite frankly I need to air and I'm just preempting it
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:09.320]  so we can take your calls but but for example like Michael Cohen broke the
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:14.760]  law yesterday either when he filed his documents or when he testified because
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:20.240]  there were inconsistencies Mark Meadows points that out I mean so so I'm not be
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.800]  able to get to any of these clips I'm not gonna be able to get to any of the
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:26.880]  responses that were unbelievable in the mainstream media I'm not gonna be able to
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:32.240]  get to Trump calling the Cohen hearing a fake hearing and then there's other
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:35.480]  clips I need to get to Trump talking about the North Korea summit how he had
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:42.440]  to walk away I believe that this is basically China's doing North Korea has
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:46.720]  always kind of been China's junkyard dog in a way so my guess is this is
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:49.680]  because Trump is in this very intense trade talks with China right now so my
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:56.600]  guess is this is China yanking the leash on North Korea and basically saying
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:00.080]  Trump's not giving us what we want on these trade deals so so you're not gonna
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.960]  have these peace talks and get anything done with Trump either but that's just my
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:09.920]  geopolitical opinion on that you've got Don Jr. maybe I'll try to get to this
[01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:15.800]  talking about Alex Jones on Tucker Carlson I mean it's just it's so much
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:21.840]  news I wanted to play the whole really a documentary from Project Veritas talking
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:24.800]  about how Facebook is censoring conservatives won't have time for that
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:30.500]  I mean it's just like it's crazy you would think that four hours of the Alex
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:36.600]  Jones show would be enough to get to all the material have it's not it's not now
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:40.480]  I will be hosting the third hour of the war room and maybe I can get some of that
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:46.680]  stuff but here's what I'm gonna do the crew is saying it's Pompeo and Bolton
[01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:51.600]  you know I don't know about that I mean Bolton maybe because the guy wants war
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.680]  but he's fighting for war in Venezuela right now I mean I don't think he's
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:59.360]  really fighting for war in North Korea I think this is China basically saying
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:05.160]  using North Korea as leverage in the trade talks but hey if you want to call
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:09.680]  in on that I'll go ahead and put out the phone number 1-877-789-Aleks
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.880]  1-877-789-Aleks your response to everything that has happened last 24
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:20.520]  hours the Kim Trump summit the Cohen testimony the Rogan podcast featuring
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:25.160]  Alex Jones those are the big ones so go ahead we'll open up the phone lines
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:32.720]  1-877-789-Aleks and I'm not gonna say first-time callers but if you're a
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:36.920]  regular caller I just want to get some some new voices some new people on today
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:44.120]  so please respect that request all right now let me do a news blitz as the crew
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:48.840]  is aggregating your phone call so I'm just gonna just pile drive through this
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:57.960]  news majority of Americans favor a border wall over green new deal wow I
[01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:03.200]  gotta say folks I don't understand this why would Americans favor building
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.040]  something to protect this country instead of demolishing the whole country
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:12.000]  I mean really I don't understand this I mean wouldn't you rather have the green
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.820]  new deal that calls for literally tearing down skyscrapers and destroying
[01:51:15.820 --> 01:51:21.600]  America it'll cost us 93 trillion dollars and ending air traffic I mean I
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.400]  think that America really wants to destroy itself not build a wall and
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:32.520]  protect itself no of course I'm being sarcastic it's the exact opposite does he
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:37.720]  need a safe space Acosta loses it after Hanoi presser makes false claim about
[01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:43.640]  White House press so you got another video of Jim the bitch Acosta whining
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:47.600]  and complaining so so here's the deal with this all these media travel to
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:51.720]  Vietnam and they want the big video they want the big hit they want the big
[01:51:51.720 --> 01:51:54.560]  exclusive they want the big clip they want the big this the big that and
[01:51:54.560 --> 01:51:59.680]  Trump basically goes there and the media is not even an afterthought to him I
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:03.200]  don't even think he gives a damn about the media so he's not giving them the
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:07.600]  stuff that they want and he's basically kind of just ignoring them and so here's
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:12.080]  a castle like I've traveled all the way to Vietnam and the and the president
[01:52:12.080 --> 01:52:18.520]  won't even listen to me it's like dude he doesn't care about you you're a little
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:23.720]  bitch we talked about the Penn State troopers being told they're not allowed
[01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:29.560]  to enforce the law if they pull over an illegal immigrant so Penn State Penn
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.840]  Pennsylvania is now becoming a de facto sanctuary state that's literally against
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:36.320]  the wall all politicians involved with that belong in jail I've read the US code
[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:42.160]  they're all breaking the law folks Ilhan Omar claims dictator Trump impeachment
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:50.200]  inevitable boy oh boy really excited for the press conference we'll be airing
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:55.720]  where Jacob Bould is gonna expose Ilhan Omar but here's the frustrating thing we
[01:52:55.720 --> 01:53:01.440]  know what we know who Ilhan Omar is where will there be any results will
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:08.680]  they'll be where they'll where will there be any action to remove this anti-
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:15.840]  American scum from office and these foreign affairs committees house passes
[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:19.720]  sweeping gun legislation to expand background checks to cover virtually all
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:26.720]  states you know this is I think there's real debate to be had here if you're a
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:32.840]  purist then shall not infringe is being infringed but what are you gonna do
[01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:38.360]  folks you've got psychotics in this country and that's just the truth you
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:43.120]  got a bunch of pill heads I mean I don't know I think this this is a real
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:46.320]  debate I'm not gonna sit here and try to play one side or the other you know
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:54.640]  where I fall in the Second Amendment but part of the problem is I think it just
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:53:57.760]  forces the left to go farther to the left when you're just like oh yeah no
[01:53:57.760 --> 01:54:03.760]  rules on guns it's like well no wait a second let's have common sense when it
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:08.480]  comes to hey this guy has been put in jail for beating his wife on multiple
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:12.760]  occasions he's made death threats to his neighbors okay background check on him
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:20.600]  do we want him to have a gun Trump and GOP promised economic growth much better
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:24.440]  than Obama's that's not what happened well this is fake news this is the first
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:30.000]  quarter though where the the GDP growth did not reach three percent now keep in
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.160]  mind these are early returns that number could could actually end up being
[01:54:35.160 --> 01:54:39.880]  higher than what their first reporting that seems to be how it's been in the
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:44.360]  past but regardless even if even if the GDP growth doesn't at three percent it
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:49.120]  will be the first time it didn't for a quarter it barely ever hid I think it
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:54.840]  hit 3% for a quarter under Obama three or four times for a year zero times so
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.280]  Trump's already beat Obama when it comes to economic growth that's that's not
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:08.240]  even up for debate here's a scary one from CBS New York NYPD MS 13 planning to
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:16.320]  target off-duty cops at their homes now ask yourself this how would MS 13 get
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:23.640]  access to that type of personal information how would MS 13 be able to
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:31.360]  get the at-home addresses of off-duty cops just ask yourself that and ask
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:35.680]  yourself what type of politician would allow this to happen well this is New
[01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:40.280]  York so you got to look at Cuomo you got to look at de Blasio you can throw
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:49.520]  Cortez in there Schumer folks if this starts happening I mean if MS 13
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.200]  really is able to get the home addresses of off-duty New York police and
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:56:01.040]  start attacking them I mean this is like folks this could be next level stuff
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:07.560]  here because again ask yourself how they are getting that information and if
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:13.040]  this goes to the top and it's as corrupt as we think it is you don't think for
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:20.720]  one second there's politicians that want good police dead I mean I don't need to
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:25.200]  get into too much of it folks but there's a lot going on behind the scenes in
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:34.360]  New York right now and it's been going on and the same brave men and women that
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:39.680]  made sure Anthony Weiner went to jail it was not easy folks trust me on that it
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:44.440]  may have seemed like a clear and obvious case you'd be surprised at how hard it
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:49.160]  is even when you have the actual evidence that's the only reason why it went
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:51.840]  down is because the public got the evidence thanks to good men and women in
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:55.040]  the police if you don't think for one second there's politicians that want to
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:58.680]  snuff out police officers that actually do their job and won't cover up for
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:05.880]  crimes at the very top well you're not living on planet earth so this is this
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:11.760]  is a scary one here folks and a lot of people say the reason why people want
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:17.480]  MS-13 in this country is so they can carry out their their hits Facebook
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:21.360]  insider leaks documents explains debusting troll report and political
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:25.320]  targeting in video interview the full 20 minute video interview is on project
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:30.280]  veritas.com it's bombshell folks and again we told you this was going on
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:33.680]  before they even executed it we told you they were engaged in sensor media
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:37.520]  social media censorship before they even gauge on it info wars is tomorrow's
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:44.680]  news today and that's why they ban us off social media not deboost us the
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:50.520]  platform us I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:56.640]  censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:03.000]  censored the most buried the most suppressed and that's the videos where
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:07.600]  you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:12.480]  authoritarians like the young turds and others it's so but hurt when Trump won
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:16.760]  they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember what
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:22.120]  political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:26.920]  to shut info wars down this is a fight about taking your speech away not just
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:30.920]  my speech about taking your very sovereignty away this country is in a
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:35.520]  war so again I want to thank you for what you've done but I want to remind you
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:38.600]  if you don't spread the articles and videos and if you don't financially get
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:42.320]  the great products we have and fund us and the 360 win we're dead in the water
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:48.720]  I'm in your hands you're in my hands info or store com thank you defeat the
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:55.440]  globalist hashtag Alex Jones defeat the pedophiles hashtag Alex Jones defeat
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:59:00.640]  Alexander Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones defeat the
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:06.040]  censors with hashtag Alex Jones they've tried to ban us off every platform out
[01:59:06.040 --> 01:59:10.680]  there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag
[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:16.640]  Alex Jones I am patient zero in the massive banning but you can override the
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:21.040]  censors now and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones we
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:26.000]  are unstoppable together we've already changed the world together with our
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:31.000]  laser focus do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter on Facebook on
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.320]  Google on YouTube everywhere call-and-talk radio c-span shout it out loud and
[01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:39.840]  public hashtag Alex Jones that's the rallying cry to restore the First
[01:59:39.840 --> 01:59:41.840]  Amendment
[01:59:41.840 --> 02:00:03.200]  creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:28.800]  all right I am going to go to the phone calls here in this hour I do want to air
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:32.480]  a clip from tucker Carlson last night
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:42.560]  sure if I even want to mention this or not but it's like info wars because CPAC
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:49.280]  is going on right now and it's like info wars is the fight club and so here's
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:54.560]  what happens and look I'll just be honest with you folks because I was
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:58.480]  explaining this to a friend of mine last night who was asking me why I'm not at
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:05.920]  CPAC I don't even know if I should get into this in fact I'm not even going to
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:09.280]  get in this because it's just personal crap I'm just babbling but it's like
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:12.880]  info wars is literally the fight club so you got all these conservatives right
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:18.960]  now at CPAC and a lot of them are info wars listeners probably tuned in right
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:23.160]  now but they know with all these other conservatives around like they know like
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:27.360]  ooh like do I talk about info wars do I talk about Alex Jones because there's
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:30.440]  really really popular conservatives they're all high and mighty on
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:34.440]  themselves that get off on insulting info wars and laughing at info wars like
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:42.920]  we're some kind of joke and so it's just funny to me with CPAC happening right
[02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:50.120]  now and all these people wondering why I'm not there it's like it's almost like
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:53.640]  I don't even want to it's almost like I don't even want info wars to be present
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:58.080]  there because it almost divides it almost puts a wedge into conservatives
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:02.160]  because you're gonna have some of these main line conservatives like oh god
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:07.480]  info wars is here gross and then you're gonna have like most of people like yes
[02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:11.520]  info wars oh my gosh and so it's like I don't even want to be involved in that
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:15.920]  and then just overall like the whole DC thing it's just like it's like a social
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:18.560]  club and I was explaining to my friend I was like dude if I was in DC right now
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:22.200]  I'd have to be out and doing social things and you can go on social media and
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:24.920]  see everybody was out last night in DC doing the stuff instead I played
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:27.920]  basketball with my friends and that's what I'd rather be doing quite frankly
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:33.880]  when I get off air but here's Don Jr. on Tucker Carlson last night talking about
[02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:40.880]  the censorship on social media so free speech doesn't mean anything if people
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:45.520]  can't hear you speak and this alliance between the activist left and big
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:49.720]  corporations is preventing people from being heard so it is in effect an attack
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:54.000]  on free speech the media benefits from our freedom of speech they are the
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.520]  prime beneficiaries of the First Amendment and yet they don't even cover
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:02.280]  it and places like CNN actually encourage companies to de-platform voices
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:05.320]  they don't think should be there they're like the arbiters they're listening
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:08.680]  right now or maybe they don't listen anymore because they censored us the
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:13.920]  majority of the press are now left-wing activists they are on the side of that
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:18.160]  they are not with a 60 minutes reporter said stymie they're not on the side that
[02:03:18.160 --> 02:03:21.720]  is being oppressed you know guys like me again I can do this because I have a
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:25.160]  big platform I have a big soapbox I can get it out there but some of the little
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:29.080]  guys they can't they don't have that ability they just end up taking it and
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:33.520]  that's what's happened you've never seen someone on the left say huh it's weird
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:37.160]  Don all of a sudden I'm following Fox News I was never following that like many
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.360]  conservatives are complaining to me and saying that all of a sudden they're
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:44.600]  following these crazy left-wing accounts that they never signed up for this is
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:50.440]  happening it's a one-way systematic attack on free speech and to me it reads
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:54.840]  like it's a trial run for 2020 how are we gonna do it I'm not saying that every
[02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:59.520]  account is suppressed but you do it enough you take off x% of the top you
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:03.920]  cut the message in half you you get rid of some of the viral nature of what my
[02:04:03.920 --> 02:04:09.280]  father frankly did very well in 2016 he played monkey in the middle with the
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:13.760]  media and what they tried to do with messaging he went right to his people he
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:18.320]  went right to the people with his message he didn't allow them to manipulate
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:22.080]  it he went right over him I think to me it reads as though they're trying to
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:26.920]  figure out how to minimize that ability again and let the media which again what
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:32.520]  93 94% left-wing activists at this point and let them drive that narrative
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:37.000]  make sure that that is the only thing that regular hard-working Americans see
[02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:43.120]  and we got to call it out we have to hit it aggressively I mean why do I get the
[02:04:43.120 --> 02:04:48.920]  feeling that Don Jr. would be the president we wanted Don Sr. to be why
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:54.120]  do I get that feeling we'll take your call
[02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:11.080]  by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:15.960]  world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:20.960]  dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:24.800]  quick boost but burnout in just a few hours and have terrible side effects we
[02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:29.520]  have developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:34.680]  energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's nothing else
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:39.640]  like it must experience it it is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:43.960]  packets to mix it with fruit juice or water whatever you'd like warning though
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:47.980]  it's very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half packet the first time you
[02:05:47.980 --> 02:05:51.440]  take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:06:11.880]  into overdrive turbo force and enforce live calm defending the republic from
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:21.880]  enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones and now your host owin shroyer
[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:32.960]  all right this was just handed to me and I hope that everyone has the same
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:36.640]  instinctual reaction that I had when the producer handed this to me who had the
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:44.960]  same reaction a 10-year-old child pressured the donald duck comic book
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:50.600]  publisher into adding a gay couple into the next issue of the cartoon fena a
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:58.000]  girl with two lesbian mothers and two gay fathers wait what what the complaint
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:02.280]  about the lack of homosexuals in the donald duck comic book and then this
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:06.720]  10-year-old is apparently making statements my parents are gays and lesbians
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:10.760]  and I think it's important that that's portrayed as normal too but in duck city
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:14.720]  it looks like it does not exist at all who do you think prepared that statement
[02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:18.000]  for her see here's the thing first of all your instinctual reaction should be
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:23.200]  why is a 10-year-old even thinking about this but then I realized it the 10-year-old
[02:07:23.200 --> 02:07:27.640]  isn't thinking about this the parents are making the 10-year-old think about
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:31.760]  this the and then the parents are actually probably making these statements
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:35.120]  for the 10-year-old this is actually a next six let's see this is why it's
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:41.320]  actually child abuse folks now look you can sit here and have a debate if you
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:47.800]  want on whether it's normal or abnormal to have two gay male fathers and two
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:56.240]  gay female mothers I've never even heard of that but fine folks I'm sorry to say
[02:07:56.240 --> 02:08:02.640]  this because it's the same thing I'm not making a blanket statement
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:08.080]  whoever raising this this girl is mentally ill and that's not because
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:14.960]  they're gay they're mentally ill it's a totally separate thing so like here's
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:20.960]  they have become radicalized by their sexuality or whatever and I guess they
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:25.520]  don't feel normal in society I mean okay yeah biologically you're supposed to be
[02:08:25.520 --> 02:08:30.680]  with the opposite sex so sorry biology says you're abnormal but society doesn't
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:34.960]  but see they can't accept that they want their biology to be normal to be
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:39.000]  normal they that's why they want to erase the science of biology so what you
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:47.000]  have here is to radical sexualized whatever's who are now using their
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:53.520]  daughter as a political pawn to make their abnormal behavior normal to
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:08:58.440]  normalize that in the society folks and I'm telling you because of the
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:03.800]  politically correct culture we are letting mentally ill people dictate our
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:09.000]  society now that's what this is that's why the left is able to go out and
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:12.440]  harass and assault Trump supporters the fact I got two new stories today happens
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:17.160]  every day now happens every damn day now black high school student attacks
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:24.000]  white peer over MAGA hat 81 year-old Trump supporter assaulted over his
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:30.160]  MAGA hat do you know why the left gets away with these hate crimes because
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:36.560]  they're mentally ill and law enforcement knows it and we even know it that's why
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:42.200]  we let them do it to us because we know they're mentally ill but once they
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:48.040]  start running society what do you get folks a screwed up society and that's
[02:09:48.040 --> 02:09:53.960]  all this is parents who have biologically abnormal lives trying to
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:58.760]  normalize that on the society and because they're miserable in their own
[02:09:58.760 --> 02:10:02.360]  existence they want everyone else to be confused and miss and I'm not making
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:06.720]  blanket statements but that's how you get a 10-year-old saying why isn't there
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:12.600]  a gay Donald duck mommy or mommies and daddies has nothing to do with a 10-year-old
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:16.080]  that's not a 10-year-old thought process it's a 10-year-old instinct that's
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:23.000]  parents abusing their child using their child as a political pawn it's sick it's
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:26.720]  mental illness folks it's mental depravity that's who the left is I
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:31.440]  promise I take your phone calls that's where we're going now Malcolm in New
[02:10:31.440 --> 02:10:38.200]  Mexico wants to comment on Alex with Joe Rogan go ahead Malcolm hi I'm great to
[02:10:38.200 --> 02:10:44.280]  talk to you I've been a listener since 2004 I still have I actually bought a hat
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:48.720]  from Alex Jones while I was at UT Austin and I still wear it sometimes here
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:53.160]  it's got 9-11 was an inside job on the back and if the war is in the front and
[02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:56.160]  you ought to see the looks I get from Lemonsley liberals here instead of
[02:10:56.160 --> 02:11:01.680]  Bay I wore a MAGA hat here I probably have a black eye but anyway let's talk
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.600]  about what Alex Jones said about Alice the Crowley during this Joe Rogan
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.960]  interview first of all I'm a former initiate of OTO I was a
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:14.760]  Minerva degree initiate lasted one month at OTO is watch astrologer with them
[02:11:14.760 --> 02:11:21.360]  at Eula's Lodge Atlanta and just say that you you were with what I was with
[02:11:21.360 --> 02:11:26.680]  I was I was the Minerva degree initiate with OTO Lodge Eula's Lodge in Atlanta
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:31.600]  Georgia and what is the lesson what it was it's one of the chapters of OTO
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:35.120]  or the template are yet this which was an organization started by Alistair
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:42.840]  Crowley and Jack Parsons in 1947 and Crow Alex Jones frequently quotes OTO a
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:48.080]  lot I noticed but anyway he made a big error yesterday I was listening to a
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:53.840]  Joe Rogan interview first off he said that Alistair Crowley at first off his
[02:11:53.840 --> 02:11:57.480]  name is pronounced Crowley not Crowley I noticed everyone on Info Wars calls it
[02:11:57.480 --> 02:12:02.720]  Crowley I think you guys listen to Ocea Osborne too much but I have to say this
[02:12:02.720 --> 02:12:08.600]  is the first Alistair Crowley supporter I think we've ever had call in I'm not
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:12.440]  hey hey hey I'm not a supporter of him I would like I said I lasted one month I
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:17.920]  saw some things I did not want to see and I withdrew my membership from them so
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:23.480]  I'm not a supporter okay okay but he did but I did study with Eula's Lodge I did
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:27.800]  study some of the literature of Crowley while I was there along with some
[02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:33.000]  astrology aspects which I thought so what did you disagree with first okay
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:39.720]  first off Alex Jones said that Alistair Crowley had a vision of a gray alien
[02:12:39.720 --> 02:12:45.000]  inside a pyramid of Egypt that's not correct Crowley saw I was which was a
[02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.320]  winged emissary of the Egyptian god Horace in the pyramid what he was
[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:56.880]  what Alex Jones was referring to Alistair Crowley did a ritual and he saw
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:01.000]  a vision of what looked like a gray alien and Crowley called this gray alien
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.600]  long LAM but it was not inside the pyramid as Alex Jones claimed this was
[02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:10.040]  something completely outside okay okay all right that's good that's fine I gotta
[02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:13.200]  be honest with you I'm not I'm not trying to be disrespectful here just quite
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:17.400]  frankly I don't think the audience cares so much about that what I do think we
[02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:22.320]  care about which I am interested in what is it that you saw and experienced for
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:28.840]  that month that you were in the the Crowley group okay I'll tell you if you
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:34.080]  got time Alex Jones will love hearing this because it has a lot to do with the
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:41.720]  word Jesus okay anyway when I was initiated the moment that they made
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:45.840]  their pronouncement I saw the person the Lodge master whatever his face turned
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:51.240]  into a very outrageous collar something came outside and it looked like I guess
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:54.680]  you could say a demon something out of the another I just want to be clear on
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:58.880]  something are you are is there a hallucinogen involved in this are there
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:01.640]  any drugs involved in this are you saying you're sober and this is happening I
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:05.960]  was I was straight as a board absolutely I was straight as a board there was no
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:09.440]  hallucinogens and but when I was initiated to my
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:13.600]  mineral degree like I said the Lodge master made his pronouncement when he
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:17.800]  did he though he turned like a different color and this color came outside and it
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:21.880]  looked like something like something from another dimension and it looked like
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:25.600]  it tried to enter me but it could not enter me for some reason it was trying
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:29.640]  to enter me and it couldn't we have to agree the theory goes you have to accept
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:34.120]  it there has to be a metaphysical consciousness of acceptance oh yeah
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:37.280]  but then here's the thing is here's what you'll probably get a kick out of no
[02:14:37.280 --> 02:14:41.720]  Alex don't get a kick out of this later on I was dating someone who also left
[02:14:41.720 --> 02:14:44.840]  the watch because I mean there was a lot of craziness going on a lot of really
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:49.520]  you know it was not the contemporary not stick Egyptian masks that we were
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:54.320]  into anymore I mean they were into some very serious dark practices and that's
[02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:57.280]  the thing that I think too I think a lot of people get into this stuff maybe as
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.560]  an entertainment value or a curiosity value and then they see it firsthand and
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:07.520]  like whoa these people are serious well another person I know another another
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:12.160]  woman on the left and I told her what I saw when when it was initiated and she
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:15.800]  was sleeping that night at the lunch was like also part of like a house in
[02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.120]  Atlanta and she said that she saw what I described her she she
[02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:23.880]  her eyes just went up she said I saw exactly what you were so this is why
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:27.280]  this stuff gets so crazy but I got 30 seconds left I just want to ask you this
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:32.200]  when did how much of this like compares to spirit cooking's or what we know and
[02:15:32.200 --> 02:15:35.960]  hear about spirit cooking's it was nothing but let me just let me just
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:39.640]  finish this real quick so anyway she said this thing was trying to rape her
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:44.160]  and she called out I command you in the name of Jesus to get out of here and she
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:48.640]  said the bank backed off and disappeared I was like wow that actually worked she
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:52.520]  said yeah well that's why they fear Jesus that's why they fear Jesus these
[02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:56.840]  cultists hey thanks for the call Malcolm most of you know that heart disease is

[02:20:03.640 --> 02:20:29.440]  2 things I need to mention here before we go back out to your phone calls so
[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:35.560]  there is power in the name of Jesus it is the name above all names it's biblical
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:41.080]  and you know here's the thing too it's like it's really just I but I should
[02:20:41.080 --> 02:20:45.200]  just stop now before I start going off on this jag and talk about but but the
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:50.720]  name of Jesus is under attack right now and it's not just them wanting to censor
[02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:53.920]  conservatives or Christians and demonizing them they're actually trying
[02:20:53.920 --> 02:20:59.400]  to say oh no it's not actually Jesus the real name is Yahweh or the real name
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:10.520]  is Yeshua and so it's all this crap to remove the power of the name Jesus from
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:19.320]  earth and so just understand folks I mean you heard the last caller I really
[02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:26.440]  don't want to get off into a jag but Jesus is real Lucifer is real God the
[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:35.600]  creator of all that is seen and unseen is real and it's really sick this will be
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:42.720]  my final statement on this and I promise I'll move on the elites know all of this
[02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:51.720]  is real and the sickest thing about it is how they push the atheist agenda how
[02:21:51.720 --> 02:21:55.960]  the elites pretend to be atheist how they pretend like evolution is real
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:22:00.840]  thing and we evolved from you know a squirrel humping a monkey or something
[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:06.760]  they know it's all bullcrap that's what the biggest secret the biggest secret
[02:22:06.760 --> 02:22:11.240]  which we already know but the elites don't want you to know this is the
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:20.800]  biggest secret folks you were literally created by God divine creation in the
[02:22:20.800 --> 02:22:27.440]  middle of something that we cannot even comprehend yet here we are that's the
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:32.320]  big secret they don't want you to know that's why they push evolution and
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:38.960]  that's why all the elites pretend to be atheists they're not they're not they
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:43.960]  just don't want you to have the power of God they don't want you to have the
[02:22:43.960 --> 02:22:52.240]  protection of Jesus now Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan have just submitted a
[02:22:52.240 --> 02:23:02.920]  request to the Attorney General William Barr that Michael Cohen now face
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:09.720]  perjury charges for his testimony and here's the problem they have the

[02:23:55.480 --> 02:23:59.840]  to the question I asked before with regards to your false statement that
[02:23:59.840 --> 02:24:06.000]  you submitted to Congress on here it was very clear that it asked for contracts
[02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:11.280]  with foreign entities over the last two years have you had any foreign contract
[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:17.080]  with foreign entities whether it's Novars or the Korean airline or Kazakhstan
[02:24:17.080 --> 02:24:23.360]  BTA Bank your testimony earlier said that you had contracts with them in fact
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:28.000]  you went into detail believe it talks about lobbying I did no lobbying on top
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.240]  of your testimony I'm not asked about lobbying Mr. Cohen they are not
[02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:36.760]  government agencies do you have it do you have foreign contracts traded
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:41.080]  companies do you have foreign contracts I currently have no foreign did you have
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:46.720]  foreign contracts over the last two years foreign contracts contracts with
[02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:51.680]  foreign entities did you have a contract yes yes why didn't you put them on the
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:55.680]  form it says it's a criminal offense to not put them on this form for the last
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.280]  two years why did you not do that because those foreign companies that
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:05.080]  you're referring to are not government companies it says non-governmental Mr.
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:09.600]  Cohen you signed it they told not me is being non-governmental in right it says
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:14.960]  foreign agency it says foreign contracts do you want us to read it to you I read
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:19.160]  it and it was reviewed by my counsel and I am a non-government employee it was
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:23.600]  not lobbying and they are not it has nothing to do with lobbying it says it's
[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:30.560]  a criminal you got caught Cohen your rat all your foreign contracts that's what it says
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:34.320]  well then I'm gonna take a look at it before I leave no you've heard I will
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:38.400]  and hopefully I will amend it prior to leaving because that's not the way I read
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:42.320]  your document you know you'll take a look at it all right sample mr. Cohen of
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:47.960]  your skirting the truth okay I want to a known liar a convicted liar continues to
[02:25:47.960 --> 02:25:53.160]  lie and now faces perjury charges Keith in North Carolina wants to talk about
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:57.920]  this go ahead Keith oh and how are you a long time listener started listening
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:02.760]  2002 first-time caller big fan of your young David he'd been on that for three
[02:26:02.760 --> 02:26:06.000]  years on a roll look at stuff appreciate all that well we appreciate your
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.800]  support Keith thank you absolutely listening to Alex and even before I
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:13.720]  think I picked up on him and Glenn back around the same time about you know
[02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:19.120]  around the same time after 9-11 so anyway picked up on a TV watch the
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.320]  testimony and I happen to tune in right when Debbie Wasserman Schultz was I
[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:28.240]  guess asking some questions on my Cohen and it reminded me of hey you know we
[02:26:28.240 --> 02:26:32.800]  haven't heard from the Awam brothers lately remember actually Luke Rosiak
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:37.920]  just published his book which is his final report on his investigation in the
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:42.520]  Wan brothers I mean it's blatant criminal activity pay for play I mean it's
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:46.320]  really unbelievable how the Democrats get away with this crap I really can't
[02:26:46.320 --> 02:26:50.600]  even figure it out honestly and yet there she is right with some kind of
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.680]  authority you're representing the and the arrogance to I mean just a pompous
[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:59.120]  arrogance of this bitch excuse me that's it no that that made me think of that
[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:02.120]  but then it made me think you know taking us to higher level up and that's
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:04.720]  one of the things I think I really appreciate you guys you guys really I
[02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:08.280]  think kind of try to get to the source and not always just describe the symptoms
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:11.480]  of the corruption but maybe you know take it all the way up to where it comes
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:16.920]  from but it made me think about the whole Rosenstein debacle with Trump and I
[02:27:16.920 --> 02:27:20.600]  wanted to ask you if this is how you remember this if I'm not mistaken when
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:24.800]  everything was playing out and Comey was doing his thing and you know if I
[02:27:24.800 --> 02:27:28.120]  wasn't mistaken I thought I've heard or read an article saying it was actually
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:33.360]  Rod Rosenstein that was advising the president to fire Comey yes that is true
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:39.560]  Rosenstein suggested Mueller hired and he suggested Comey fired correct okay okay
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:44.200]  so that I'm on the right page now now add on to that what's the guy McCabe
[02:27:44.200 --> 02:27:47.880]  going around making his rounds and I was watching that interview and then I'm
[02:27:47.880 --> 02:27:51.760]  listening to him saying oh oh yeah you know Rosenstein as soon as he was a
[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:56.080]  point of whatever he started mobilizing and getting together a panel of people
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:28:01.640]  to go after Trump right yes and obviously these people you know soon
[02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:05.000]  with none of us have memories you know I can't connect the dots but basically
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.240]  what he said is about the same time Rod is advising Trump to fire Mueller on
[02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:12.600]  the other side of his mouth he's already getting putting together a panel of
[02:28:12.600 --> 02:28:17.520]  impeachers right yeah yeah so and I think you misspoke there you meant fire
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:22.840]  Comey right yes I'm sorry fire Comey yeah well it's all a big see but it's all
[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:26.000]  a big con game it's kind of like Wasserman Schultz up there posing
[02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:30.240]  arrogantly when she knows that she's she's a criminal but it's all about the
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:33.600]  confidence act it's all about the confidence act so it's like oh yeah oh
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:40.120]  mr. president fire Jim Comey he's out to get you he's no good and then but what
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:43.840]  is he really doing he's actually working on removing you from office so it's just
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:50.120]  this it's a big con game with these people from Wasserman Schultz to Rosenstein
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:56.700]  they're just they're just all bunch of con men number one international best

[02:32:55.720 --> 02:33:10.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show I've been everywhere man I've been
[02:33:10.200 --> 02:33:17.960]  everywhere man cross desert bear man I've read the mountain there man
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:24.360]  I've been everywhere a couple things to highlight here Michelle Malkin is now
[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:28.760]  being warned by Twitter to seek legal counsel because she violated Pakistani
[02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:38.560]  law Michelle Malkin lives in America so apparently Twitter now is Pakistani law
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:42.880]  enforcement and we're gonna try to get Michelle Malkin on air great
[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:48.520]  conservative commentator and has a syndicated column that she writes so
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:52.360]  Twitter's now telling her that she broke Pakistani law and she needs to seek
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:34:01.680]  legal counsel huh okay yesterday Alex Jones was on the Joe Rogan podcast and
[02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:07.360]  one of the I guess I guess he's a talking-headed commentator whatever over
[02:34:07.360 --> 02:34:14.840]  at the young Turks Hassan Piker said Joe Rogan is letting Alex Jones get away
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:20.680]  with everything right now you mean free speech Hassan you mean free speech
[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:24.800]  Piker so yes that's I mean we told you these people hate free speech now
[02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:28.480]  they're just openly admitting it I mean getting away with everything getting away
[02:34:28.480 --> 02:34:36.600]  with what free speech literally now jokingly Piker responded to me and said
[02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:40.360]  yes I expected the citizens rest and I told him come on the Alex Jones show
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:44.400]  we'll let you get away with everything too somehow I doubt he does I was even
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:48.600]  shocked that he responded to me I look even though we have political
[02:34:48.600 --> 02:34:50.800]  differences I wish we could at least come together it's like the same thing
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.080]  like if we could do political boxing it would actually be healthy it really
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:00.720]  would and it'd be massively popular it'd be massively profitable but you know who
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:06.480]  always avoids it the left just like they always avoid a debate they don't want
[02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:11.720]  to be in the same arena as us because they can't beat us now let's go back out
[02:35:11.720 --> 02:35:15.360]  to the phone lines where Josh is calling in from St. Louis Missouri go ahead
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:21.640]  Josh hey what's up Owen just wanted to touch base with you we're all proud of
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:26.400]  you out here in St. Louis and I just want to talk to you about the Joe Rogan
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:30.920]  podcast yesterday they shout out the shout out to St. Louis my hometown thank
[02:35:30.920 --> 02:35:35.560]  you go ahead Josh yeah we're gonna talk about the Joe Rogan podcast about how
[02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:39.280]  you know Alex was basically talking about how he thinks the Republicans are
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:42.680]  the ones that are you know fermenting this freedom of speech thing and how
[02:35:42.680 --> 02:35:46.040]  they're not doing anything and then you're talking to Jacob today and
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:50.920]  they're like where is the opposition research on the Republican side how does
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:54.560]  nobody look at this yearbooks for blackface how does no one know about
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:36:00.480]  this brother with this Muslim congresswoman in Minnesota like what
[02:36:00.480 --> 02:36:04.840]  are what are they doing like if any of that came out during the election a
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:08.760]  guarantee they wouldn't have got elected like what I can ask this is actually
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:14.000]  this is actually a great question now I disagree with your final comment which
[02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.880]  is how they probably wouldn't get elected I don't know about that I don't
[02:36:16.880 --> 02:36:21.280]  even know if I trust elections at all to be perfectly honest with you and the
[02:36:21.280 --> 02:36:28.080]  left doesn't care about their own crimes that's been proven however there's a
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:33.240]  couple responses this one you ask why doesn't the right or conservatives or
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:36.960]  Republicans do this and the easiest answer I can give you is because our
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:41.400]  hearts aren't filled with hate the reason why the left engages in spending
[02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:44.440]  all this time going through the background and tweets and all of this
[02:36:44.440 --> 02:36:48.000]  crap and trying to find anything they can drudge up on their opponents is
[02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:51.920]  because their heart is filled with hate and so when your heart is filled with
[02:36:51.920 --> 02:36:56.760]  hate you're not looking towards finding solutions you're looking on destroying
[02:36:56.760 --> 02:37:01.280]  and so in this instance they just look to destroy their political opponents
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:04.520]  instead of actually finding solutions of the problems they claim exists they
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:08.760]  just seek and destroy so that's motivated by hatred that's in their heart
[02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:14.240]  now the second aspect of this is that conservatives not motivated by hate
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:19.000]  hatred but by information intelligence and getting that out to the public they
[02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:22.160]  don't go after people's personal life they don't go through the dirt and the
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:27.600]  mud and try to find all this crap however this is starting to change Josh and
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:31.720]  that's why people like Jacob wool exist that's why people like Ali Alexander
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:35.680]  exist and and and even Mike Cernovich doing a lot of great work and you notice
[02:37:35.680 --> 02:37:39.960]  again you don't hear much about these people on television news maybe an
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:43.760]  instance they get a mention but it's very rare because it's just not what the
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:48.760]  right does I think it's changing I think that we're just beginning to see that
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:53.080]  tide turning and it'll be interesting to see what the left does because they
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:56.840]  know that they got all the skeletons in their closet they know that they're the
[02:37:56.840 --> 02:38:00.360]  dirtbags that's why they engage in these tactics to distract from their own
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:05.000]  nonsense that goes on their own blackface their own KKK comments their own
[02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:10.520]  the wife of route northern was handing out cotton on a field trip to black
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:15.520]  students the other day saying now you know how it feels I mean wow so so I
[02:38:15.520 --> 02:38:19.600]  don't know if that answers your question Josh but I do think I do think that
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:24.320]  trend is gonna change I sure hope to hope so because like it seems like they're
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:28.200]  not even trying and we're trying to take back our country and we're trying to
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:32.000]  vote for people that you know are I have the same values as we do and then if
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:36.520]  they're not gonna go and try their hardest and look into a yearbook of the
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:41.560]  guy that they're that they're you know going against like what what are they
[02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:45.200]  gonna do like we have that's very that's a very that's a very mundane level
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:49.600]  because these the corruption that we're fighting you know this it's been going on
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:52.960]  for I mean quite frankly centuries but I mean in modern history it's been going
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:56.800]  on for decades so I mean we're going up against corrupt courts we're going up
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:02.320]  up against corrupt FBI corrupt CIA corrupt DHS corrupt politicians so it
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:08.160]  takes a while to kind of get the clutter out of the way and be effective yeah I
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:11.720]  guess that's what happens when you have eight years of our probably more than
[02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:15.840]  that 20 years of trash in our in our total garbage and they have stayed
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:21.640]  behind networks operating actively right now yep it's just like what what's
[02:39:21.640 --> 02:39:25.120]  what's gonna look like after eight years of Trump you know like hopefully we get
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:29.840]  all well there you go exactly exactly all right Josh thank you so much for the
[02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:36.760]  phone call let's jump out to Brandon in Kentucky go ahead Brandon hey Owen how's
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.760]  it going good thanks for calling hey real quick my whole family does the
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:46.880]  super blue anti-move floor at two space and we all love it I'm 43 and I've
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:51.480]  never been on social media and I listen to you guys all day long and the reason
[02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:57.120]  I called I heard your comment about the gun control and I think that you're
[02:39:57.120 --> 02:40:01.360]  you're dealing you're thinking that we're deal with rational people and we're
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:05.360]  not dealing with rational people I don't feel like we should be given an inch to
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.360]  the leftist on anything ever fundamentally I agree with you hold on
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:13.680]  fundamentally I agree with you but I have kind of a I mean it's more of an
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:18.720]  intellectual thing where I realized that if we go with a a hard-line approach
[02:40:18.720 --> 02:40:23.880]  like that it just makes them go even harder to the left and so you have to
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:28.440]  you have to be at least reasonable in considering a debate on these topics
[02:40:28.440 --> 02:40:34.280]  that's my order to the left well I mean they're gonna they're gonna take our
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:37.640]  gun they're already openly saying they're gonna kill babies but that's what I'm
[02:40:37.640 --> 02:40:40.760]  saying but that's what I'm saying but I'm saying if we sit here and we just say
[02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:43.680]  shout out and friends everybody and anybody can get a gun then they're gonna
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:49.600]  say okay we have to you know call for total gunbans well I I don't feel that
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:53.480]  that's the right way to go about it I mean you have to I I feel like we have
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:59.320]  to come up with a way a means to fight these people legitimately I mean
[02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:05.120]  militantly without violence that's where I'm at I mean what what more what more
[02:41:05.120 --> 02:41:10.200]  can they do to us well here's what we find out do we even really have a vote
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:18.720]  anymore and if we don't and we we learn this and America learns this they're
[02:41:18.720 --> 02:41:28.360]  gonna be clinging to their guns for life go up wake up get rid of these these
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:32.920]  people that we've got represent this Mitch McConnell from my state is asking
[02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:38.040]  to go we need real people that are gonna look out for us and I agree with what
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:40.920]  you said about Don Jr. I'll jump off here because I know you got a lot of
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:46.560]  callers we appreciate you man that's it yeah every time I hear Don Jr. talk
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:52.040]  thanks for the call it feels like he would be the president we wanted Donald
[02:41:52.040 --> 02:41:56.520]  Trump to be and again look Donald Trump president Trump's done a lot of great
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:42:01.880]  things but and maybe it's because he's so inundated and then distracted to a
[02:42:01.880 --> 02:42:04.240]  certain extent he's got all these different things he's working on he just
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:08.360]  isn't moving fast enough on the issues that are big enough biggest to us but I
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:11.720]  just feel like Don Jr. gets in there he's not gonna put up with social media
[02:42:11.720 --> 02:42:16.160]  censorship he's gonna sick someone on that immediately but I don't know maybe
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:20.600]  time will tell I I mean it would appear that Don Jr. has presidential
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:25.000]  aspirations but again only time will tell and only time will tell if eight
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:30.320]  years of Trump will have the same effect on this country as far as just any
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:34.440]  effect as Obama's eight years did obviously it'd be pro-america unlike
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:37.880]  Obama anti-america all right folks we got a break coming up more calls on

[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:45.880]  welcome back to the alex jones show no you're not in the wonderful world of
[02:47:45.880 --> 02:47:53.720]  Oz but you might as well be because it's pretty trippy around here all right
[02:47:53.720 --> 02:47:58.280]  we're taking your phone calls here on the alex jones show I will be sticking
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:02.360]  around for the fourth hour I'm gonna be covering the jacob wool press conference
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:09.600]  airing some epic clips from alex jones on Joe Rogan yesterday and maybe taking
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:12.840]  some more of your calls but let's go back out of the phone lines now Victor
[02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:18.600]  from California has called in go ahead Victor hello and thank you for taking my
[02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:24.640]  call I'm a new listener I've been I just found out about info wars about a month
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:31.960]  ago and a war room a couple weeks ago right yeah I did yeah I was talking
[02:48:31.960 --> 02:48:36.640]  about Savannah and what a great job she did on your show if you remember and yeah
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:39.480]  I remember talking to you I remember you telling me how you discovered us and
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:42.800]  everything yeah go ahead Victor yeah exactly so I was watching you guys
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:48.880]  yesterday and then I saw you showing the clips from the Joe Rogan show so I
[02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:52.840]  watched the entire thing entire four and a half hours I gotta tell you man it was
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:58.760]  great it was informative entertaining and funny I didn't realize how funny Alex
[02:48:58.760 --> 02:49:03.640]  is it was here it was here was the magic one of the best shows I've ever seen in
[02:49:03.640 --> 02:49:08.920]  my life here was the magical thing about this to me and and we're showing the
[02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:15.920]  clip right now Eddie Bravo Alex Jones and Joe Rogan to me it's just three alpha
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:21.080]  males not censoring their free speech opening up their mind opening up their
[02:49:21.080 --> 02:49:25.600]  intellect and then just letting go and you don't get that enough in media
[02:49:25.600 --> 02:49:29.080]  anymore and that's why it was so refreshing because it's just three men
[02:49:29.080 --> 02:49:34.760]  who are friends alpha males who are just like we're just talking we're just
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:38.440]  having a conversation like we were sitting at the bar that's what talk
[02:49:38.440 --> 02:49:43.040]  radio used to be but now with political correctness and and then all the other
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:47.080]  garbage and people afraid of being censored you rarely get this anymore so
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.440]  that's why I think it was so refreshing in this age of censorship and in this age
[02:49:51.440 --> 02:49:55.640]  of attacking masculinity to just have three alpha males sitting around chumming
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:02.400]  it up talking about real stuff I agree it was it was amazing and there's they
[02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:06.680]  discussed so many topics so much so much new information that I didn't know
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:12.080]  about before it's hard to describe it so that's why I want everybody who didn't
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:15.680]  see it to go back and watch the entire thing one thing I was gonna mention
[02:50:15.680 --> 02:50:20.920]  Alex talked about his health and the stress he's under and how he stopped
[02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:25.200]  working out his diet is not as good as it used to be just because of all the
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:28.880]  stress that he's under it and I just wanted to encourage you if you talk to
[02:50:28.880 --> 02:50:34.160]  Alex please let him know that I support him as a new listener and he really
[02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:37.160]  needs to take care of himself man he needs to start working out what his
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:42.840]  dad maybe he can go work out with you and well you know I'm I'm really
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:47.680]  concerned about his health I just want to be as healthy as possible well thank
[02:50:47.680 --> 02:50:52.640]  you and I know that a lot of people pray for Alex and and you know do worry
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:59.040]  about his health but you know as far as that's concerned here's my thing I mean
[02:50:59.040 --> 02:51:04.400]  I endure some stress obviously and and whatever but I don't have a family and
[02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:09.040]  I don't run this company that has a hundred employees so I can't even imagine
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:14.640]  the levels of stress that Alex gets just just from those other you know things in
[02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:18.200]  his life that I can't even imagine so I'm not gonna sit here and be like hey
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:22.880]  Alex you know come work out with me two hours a night he's got kids and a wife
[02:51:22.880 --> 02:51:28.400]  to think about at home so I think that there's a certain level I think that the
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:33.360]  stress that Alex gets though more than anything if I could impart anything to
[02:51:33.360 --> 02:51:42.040]  Alex it's just that you know don't put so much pressure on yourself and I think
[02:51:42.040 --> 02:51:48.600]  that that is what drives Alex's stress more than anything is that he puts so
[02:51:48.600 --> 02:51:54.920]  much pressure on himself knowing the role he's in to just be totally efficient
[02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:58.240]  and effective which is impossible to be all the time I mean nobody bats a
[02:51:58.240 --> 02:52:02.640]  thousand in Major League Baseball the best baseball players in the history of
[02:52:02.640 --> 02:52:08.400]  the world failed you know 70% of the time they they they bat it so I mean I
[02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:12.240]  think that that's what what adds to Alex's stress more than anything other
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:16.000]  than the fact he's got all these these things on his shoulder is that he really
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:22.520]  does apply the pressure to himself to be as effective as possible and when you
[02:52:22.520 --> 02:52:25.720]  try to do that I mean it's like I can't even get all the information I want here
[02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:28.880]  in four hours of an Alex Jones show I can't imagine trying to accomplish
[02:52:28.880 --> 02:52:32.480]  everything that Alex wants to accomplish in 24 hours I can barely do it half the
[02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:37.040]  time but I'll tell you what just keep praying for Alex and I know that Alex
[02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:42.080]  appreciates that and I will put in a word to him and I'll say hey Alex you
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:46.600]  know let's let's maybe just recommit 30 minutes 40 minutes an hour a day to
[02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:50.800]  exercise the the audience the audience really wants you to be in the best
[02:52:50.800 --> 02:52:57.440]  health possible thank you Owen one more thing I was gonna mention I was thinking
[02:52:57.440 --> 02:53:00.680]  about buying some products you know I haven't bought anything from you guys
[02:53:00.680 --> 02:53:04.040]  yet but I wanted to get some books I wanted to get Roger Stone's book
[02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:09.480]  something else but then I heard all these reports about Chase Bank closing
[02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:12.440]  people bank accounts just because they're conservative like Martina
[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:16.840]  Marcota for example I have a chase credit card so now I'm afraid to use the
[02:53:16.840 --> 02:53:20.600]  chase credit card on your website because I'm afraid they may cancel my
[02:53:20.600 --> 02:53:24.640]  credit or close my account well I would say in the near future to be done about
[02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:28.040]  this yes I would say in the near future you're you're probably fine but but
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:31.280]  you're thinking forward in like I mean who knows where the country goes but
[02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:35.040]  maybe in a year two years four years five years they might look at you and
[02:53:35.040 --> 02:53:38.680]  say wow this person shopped at Info or store let's cancel his account that's
[02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:42.800]  what's coming next there's probably work around to that I mean you could get
[02:53:42.800 --> 02:53:47.200]  like a prepaid card or or you know I don't know I'm not gonna suggest you
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:50.400]  start another bank account or whatever but maybe that's what you have to do
[02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:55.600]  just ditch chase and tell them why you know be like hi I have to end my line
[02:53:55.600 --> 02:54:00.360]  of credit with you because of you know what I'm seeing you guys doing as far as
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:05.280]  political you know motivated which really I guess it's like financial
[02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:10.800]  censorship kind of but I don't know Victor that's that's a tough decision
[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:13.720]  that's one that's one obviously you're thinking about Victor thank you so much
[02:54:13.720 --> 02:54:17.920]  for calling and for considering going to Info or store for the first time let's
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:23.480]  go to Uncle Sam now in Louisiana Uncle Sam go ahead you're on the Alex Jones
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:30.320]  show hey God bless you there oh and it's talk to you always get to talk to you I
[02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:36.160]  got some great news for you good news anyway I was wearing my mega hat at the
[02:54:36.160 --> 02:54:40.960]  Uptown Whole Foods stores the other day and two people came up said like your
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:45.560]  hat and that's probably one of the most liberal areas of the city so I thought
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:49.360]  was pretty cool now now you're in New Orleans just so people know in case they
[02:54:49.360 --> 02:54:53.120]  don't know who the caller is Uncle Sam does videos on his YouTube channel he
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:54:57.680]  goes out in New Orleans and dresses like Uncle Sam and just does street
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:01.760]  conversations slash interviews he's actually won an Info Wars competition
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:09.680]  before and he get he gets some powerful footage on there too yeah so well
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:13.400]  it's no all into the streets and like you brought it up if you're gonna go out
[02:55:13.400 --> 02:55:17.320]  there and fight this war the front lines is the streets and that's where I've
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:22.400]  been for the past six years doing this and it was for the censorship they've
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:27.760]  been just knocking off subscribers off my site like crazy this week it's it's
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:32.320]  insane I can I won't post a video for four or five days and my subscriptions
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:37.800]  go up I start posting videos and all of a sudden I lose them it's weird and if
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:45.320]  anybody wants to go to it it's Michael the Barry DI capital B aRI on YouTube
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:50.560]  there and if that's subscribe button but that's one of the things I'm really
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:54.080]  kind of like you've been talking about it of course I can't wait till about three
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:56:02.200]  o'clock to get to see what title Omar the press conference is gonna say that's
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:06.160]  gonna be I'd love to see her go down yeah that'll actually be beginning here in
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:09.840]  about ten minutes it's actually three o'clock Eastern to clarify so two o'clock
[02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:14.200]  central here yeah but so you so yeah I just want to clarify that that'll be
[02:56:14.200 --> 02:56:18.400]  coming up here in ten minutes and one of when you mentioned the social media
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:24.880]  networks you guys have is there a place on your site they hit on them and you
[02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:29.800]  know to contact or to get on them because I can't find where you are are you
[02:56:29.800 --> 02:56:34.360]  talking about info comms yeah info comms yeah you can just go to yeah you can
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:41.520]  just go to info comms.org info comms.org is the website that's terrific yeah
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:46.240]  because I figured that's a great place to make some contacts on that one too one
[02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:50.240]  of the thing I didn't and you mentioned it briefly you brought it up and what the
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:55.560]  past week and it kind of stuck my craw because Trump's doing a lot of good
[02:56:55.560 --> 02:57:03.040]  positive things but the one thing that just really slammed in me into a walls
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:09.400]  when he came out started promoting that 5g yeah pushing for 6g even and yeah and
[02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:15.000]  this is to me you know just to try to understand where Trump is coming from I
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:20.280]  think Trump sees this as a technology breakthrough and to him that's economic a
[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:25.720]  positive thing it creates jobs it creates new technology so that's
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:30.160]  something that Trump I feel like is just built into his principles is just yes
[02:57:30.160 --> 02:57:35.280]  jobs yes creation yes innovation yes technology and my guess is there's just
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:39.800]  nobody in his ear saying hey president look at the studies on 5g hey president
[02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:43.800]  look at the studies of wireless radio waves so so I don't know if the president
[02:57:43.800 --> 02:57:46.560]  even knows what he's promoting
[02:57:53.680 --> 02:58:00.000]  my leaps and my bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the

[02:59:58.160 --> 03:00:07.720]  all right ladies and gentlemen we were worried we may not be able to connect
[03:00:07.720 --> 03:00:12.160]  with Matt Racken today he had a tech issue at his house but he is connected
[03:00:12.160 --> 03:00:16.000]  and he will now be hosting the fourth hour so we're looking forward to having
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:22.640]  him take over and we will be airing the Jacob wool press conference whenever
[03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:27.600]  that goes live and they make their conclusive statements upon the findings
[03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:32.800]  of their investigation into Ilhan Omar real quick for a new splits here
[03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:39.000]  lawmakers demand answers on surprise microphones inside the Google Nest oh
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:43.400]  okay so what you're gonna put Sundar Pachai back on the stand under oath so
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:48.120]  we can get away with perjury. FTC's new task force could be trouble for big tech
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:54.040]  today this one is out of the Wall Street Journal again the FTC has launched a new
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:59.640]  task force to look at monopolistic practices of big tech we'll see if that
[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:03.880]  rubber ever meets the road actress Jennifer Lawrence lays out a plan to
[03:01:03.880 --> 03:01:07.040]  save America so Jennifer Lawrence has it all figured out folks she's she's gonna
[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:13.040]  she's gonna take care of everything no the irony here is that Hollywood telling
[03:01:13.040 --> 03:01:18.000]  us how to run our lives is the most ridiculous thing ever and it's the
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:22.720]  arrogance of these people that they think we care we don't we're not even going to
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:27.840]  see your movies anymore and then this story made me realize the truth about
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:33.720]  Bill Maher statements the other day when he said that you know flyover country
[03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:38.600]  is jealous of the the coasts oh really we're jealous of feces and needles on the
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:42.480]  streets of San Francisco really we're jealous of taxes in New York that are so
[03:01:42.480 --> 03:01:46.880]  high people are leaving in droves no the truth is that Bill Maher and Jennifer
[03:01:46.880 --> 03:01:51.120]  Lawrence are jealous of flyover country that we actually live simple lives
[03:01:51.120 --> 03:01:55.440]  happy lives and we don't need all the glitz in the glamour to make us happy
[03:01:55.440 --> 03:02:01.400]  that's their misery projected on to us they're the ones that wish they live in
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:04.480]  flyover country they're the ones that can't stand the fact they live in these
[03:02:04.480 --> 03:02:11.040]  overcrowded literal hell holes covered in human feces but then they try to deny
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:17.280]  it and project it on to us like oh they're so jealous of us no we're not we
[03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:24.000]  can't stand you anymore this is from the Hollywood reporter look at this did the
[03:02:24.000 --> 03:02:29.320]  pressures and anxiety of modern fame play any role in Jesse Smollett's
[03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:36.680]  seemingly inexplicable behavior inexplicable the guy hated Trump and he
[03:02:36.680 --> 03:02:42.360]  hated white people there's his behavior explained but can you believe again I'm
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:46.840]  about to break Jesse Smollett and the pressure of Hollywood fame oh my gosh
[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:52.120]  it's so hard I'm a pampered actor that gets anything and everything I want and
[03:02:52.120 --> 03:02:57.960]  millions of dollars it's so hard on me oh feel bad for me America I just staged
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:02.600]  a hate crime a total hoax to try to start a race war in this country please
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:08.760]  feel bad for me and the liberal press goes along with it London blood soaked
[03:03:08.760 --> 03:03:13.480]  after five stabbings in 24 hours well you know who did that Netanyahu to be
[03:03:13.480 --> 03:03:17.720]  charged with bribery pending hearing that story has been floating for two
[03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:25.560]  years immigrants suspected of five rapes in Swedish ski village okay let's get a
[03:03:25.560 --> 03:03:30.280]  quick call in here let's go to D in New York D I'm sorry you got 60 seconds but
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:36.280]  go ahead hi Owen that's alright I just wanted to make a comment about that to
[03:03:36.280 --> 03:03:40.160]  leave woman from yesterday during the Cohen hearing when she called Mark
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:46.280]  Meadows a racist and Eliza Cummings you know like grain standard about how what
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:49.720]  great friends they are and yet you're the chairman of the committee and you
[03:03:49.720 --> 03:03:55.240]  allowed her to get away with it and you allowed that pathetic want to be apology
[03:03:55.240 --> 03:03:59.080]  that she lobbed out someone we know exactly who you meant honey we know
[03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:02.560]  you were talking to Mark Meadows I just wanted to get your opinion on what you
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:07.240]  thought you know Elijah Cummings is a really interesting case because he is
[03:04:07.240 --> 03:04:13.360]  like he's not like he has radical leftist instincts but like on a certain
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:17.240]  level he does play things down the middle I mean you can go back and if you
[03:04:17.240 --> 03:04:20.280]  go back and listen to the Daryl Issa hearings with Elijah Cummings he was
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:24.080]  all pissed off that Congress was trying to hide the truth about that and like you
[03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:28.920]  said I mean he is despite him and Jim Jordan you know bashing heads politically
[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:33.560]  they are good friends so it's this weird same thing with Van Jones Van Jones was
[03:04:33.560 --> 03:04:37.640]  at CPAC and he did an interview with some guys that were wearing Trump hats
[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:41.560]  totally cool inter exchange but when he goes on CNN it's like a totally
[03:04:41.560 --> 03:04:45.120]  different thing so so I don't really know if I can fully explain that but as
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:48.960]  far as this radical leftist claiming that Mark Meadows is racist she's
[03:04:48.960 --> 03:04:53.320]  probably a racist and so that's why she's projecting
[03:04:53.320 --> 03:04:58.360]  living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real
[03:04:58.360 --> 03:05:02.640]  drama can be found here in Lailania States but a lot of us on the big island
[03:05:02.640 --> 03:05:06.960]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:12.480]  volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the
[03:05:12.480 --> 03:05:17.520]  pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests
[03:05:17.520 --> 03:05:23.080]  for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact
[03:05:23.080 --> 03:05:28.200]  unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested
[03:05:28.200 --> 03:05:32.520]  the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal
[03:05:32.520 --> 03:05:37.800]  levels within safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as
[03:05:37.800 --> 03:05:43.760]  it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what
[03:05:43.760 --> 03:05:48.000]  we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater
[03:05:48.000 --> 03:06:05.480]  supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[03:06:07.480 --> 03:06:11.000]  all right ladies and gentlemen in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show we've
[03:06:11.000 --> 03:06:16.560]  got two things coming up the press conference where the findings in the
[03:06:16.560 --> 03:06:20.280]  investigation into Ilhan Omar that is going to be coming up shortly and Matt
[03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:24.680]  Bracken takes over the fourth hour now I'm about to hand the baton over to Matt
[03:06:24.680 --> 03:06:29.760]  and I want to hand it over in this fashion a lot of what you have predicted
[03:06:29.760 --> 03:06:32.680]  on the Alex Jones show has come to fruition we're not celebrating this
[03:06:32.680 --> 03:06:38.240]  it's just the truth and now seemingly every day there's a new attack on a
[03:06:38.240 --> 03:06:43.280]  Trump supporter by a radical leftist and as we predicted here yourself
[03:06:43.280 --> 03:06:49.080]  included the left is now staging crimes to blame Trump supporters Matt Bracken
[03:06:49.080 --> 03:06:52.760]  you predicted all about that all this you you wrote about it on your website
[03:06:52.760 --> 03:06:57.720]  enemies4nanddomestic.com you wrote about it in your books so I just want to hand
[03:06:57.720 --> 03:07:02.960]  the baton off to you and get you off racing to just comment on the fact
[03:07:02.960 --> 03:07:06.520]  that the left is becoming more unhinged trying to start a race war in this
[03:07:06.520 --> 03:07:11.960]  country and trying to frame crimes it's probably just gonna get worse on
[03:07:11.960 --> 03:07:15.840]  conservative so Matt Bracken enemies4nanddomestic.com he
[03:07:15.840 --> 03:07:21.880]  takes over he's got his exclusive intel Matt Bracken thanks Owen yeah it's um
[03:07:21.880 --> 03:07:26.360]  this is something that that resonated with me yesterday I or when I when I
[03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:32.760]  saw the Joe Rogan interview with Alex you know Joe said a lot of the stuff
[03:07:32.760 --> 03:07:37.440]  you've been predicting is turned out to be true too and and my response is the
[03:07:37.440 --> 03:07:41.080]  same as Alex's I don't want to be right about this stuff I'd rather be wrong
[03:07:41.080 --> 03:07:47.200]  you know who wants who wants this potential Civil War race war that we're
[03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:53.800]  lurching into nobody sane would want it so it's more in the in the in the manner
[03:07:53.800 --> 03:07:58.600]  of trying to warn people that are wondering is this can this really be
[03:07:58.600 --> 03:08:03.960]  happening and what should I do to prepare you know it's I don't like being a
[03:08:03.960 --> 03:08:09.200]  Cassandra I don't like being you know a preacher of doom and gloom I wish that I
[03:08:09.200 --> 03:08:13.720]  could just write you know genre detective fiction during the good old days
[03:08:13.720 --> 03:08:19.520]  you know the 60s 70s 80s I mean in paradoxically we had the looming threat
[03:08:19.520 --> 03:08:24.760]  of a global nuclear holocaust over the top of our heads but it never happened
[03:08:24.760 --> 03:08:30.400]  and the times were basically pretty good you maybe the technology wasn't as cool
[03:08:30.400 --> 03:08:34.400]  we didn't have smartphones you know you had pay phones that you had to find and
[03:08:34.400 --> 03:08:39.080]  put coins in if you can you you know youngsters can even imagine but now look
[03:08:39.080 --> 03:08:45.120]  at the look at the societal collapse around our heads when when you see the
[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:50.480]  major one of the two major parties defending and fantasize there's no
[03:08:50.480 --> 03:08:57.400]  other way to put it this this harkens back to to you know ancient ancient
[03:08:57.400 --> 03:09:03.600]  civilizations that went off the rails in such spectacular fashion that they're
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:08.960]  remembered you know down through the millennia you know like the Sodom and
[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:14.880]  Gomorrah's you know they they become such a spectacular fail that that it's
[03:09:14.880 --> 03:09:20.280]  it's preached in oral and then written tradition generation after generation
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:27.040]  these are societies that are are just glaring out to the world that they're
[03:09:27.040 --> 03:09:31.960]  about to collapse when you have the sexualizing of children you know when
[03:09:31.960 --> 03:09:38.440]  you have little boys in gay strip clubs doing the bump and grind in G strings
[03:09:38.440 --> 03:09:44.720]  yeah like 10 11 year old boys trans boys this is this is not a healthy
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:50.800]  society folks and you can say what you want about the Chinese and the Russians
[03:09:50.800 --> 03:09:55.880]  maybe even to some extent the Iranians you can say what you want about their
[03:09:55.880 --> 03:10:00.600]  cultures and societies even their religions but when they look at us they
[03:10:00.600 --> 03:10:06.320]  have to be shaking their heads and saying this is a society that is that is
[03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:12.800]  stumbling towards a collapse you know there's no there's no coincidence that
[03:10:12.800 --> 03:10:18.040]  two of our most high-tech destroyers burke class destroyers were hit by
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:25.200]  tankers this is a warning that our military even our military has lost its
[03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:31.800]  way political correctness in the United States has become the most important
[03:10:31.800 --> 03:10:38.800]  value there are naval captains and admirals who who are basically pretending
[03:10:38.800 --> 03:10:43.280]  that the naked emperor is wearing beautiful clothes they get up every day
[03:10:43.280 --> 03:10:48.800]  and they say political correctness is where it's at diversity is our strength
[03:10:48.800 --> 03:10:55.240]  they know it's a lie they know that our our best military units have become
[03:10:55.240 --> 03:11:01.240]  political correct clown shows this is this is not a way to run a military
[03:11:01.240 --> 03:11:05.440]  that's going to win any kind of a serious major war I'm not talking about
[03:11:05.440 --> 03:11:09.440]  drone wars where you know you can throw a couple elite troops on the ground and
[03:11:09.440 --> 03:11:14.520]  have predators circling you know to drop hellfires I'm talking about a grinded
[03:11:14.520 --> 03:11:21.480]  out on the ground like Korean War two or or war in Europe or or war in Southeast
[03:11:21.480 --> 03:11:29.520]  Asia a serious real war our present our present civilization our society would
[03:11:29.520 --> 03:11:34.080]  not support could not support a World War two today we would fold up like a
[03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:39.880]  cheap suit nobody would want to you know to join the military by the tens of
[03:11:39.880 --> 03:11:45.880]  thousands and go to fight at Iwo Jima and Okinawa a Normandy landing and we
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:51.280]  just couldn't do it and our enemies know it our country's becoming a very
[03:11:51.280 --> 03:11:57.680]  dangerous clown show and and now the latest thing is social media just
[03:11:57.680 --> 03:12:03.520]  absolutely putting the screws on with censorship this is because the left can't
[03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:09.840]  win an argument what they have to do is put the mute button on all other
[03:12:09.840 --> 03:12:15.400]  arguments other than the left this is why we've seen you know Tommy Robinson's
[03:12:15.400 --> 03:12:22.240]  unbelievable terrific video on the panorama ex the panorama BBC expose
[03:12:22.240 --> 03:12:27.240]  anybody who hasn't seen this really take an hour and watch this it's a it's a if
[03:12:27.240 --> 03:12:32.520]  you can imagine the British version of 60 minutes having the tables turned on
[03:12:32.520 --> 03:12:37.800]  them by a reverse sting so the conservative who's being set up as the
[03:12:37.800 --> 03:12:44.080]  as the Patsy in the documentary turns the tables and actually does an expose a
[03:12:44.080 --> 03:12:51.080]  160 minutes or BBC panorama well within within one less than one day of this
[03:12:51.080 --> 03:12:56.400]  video being out Tommy Robinson was completely banned from Facebook and
[03:12:56.400 --> 03:13:01.880]  Instagram where he had you know unbelievable numbers of followers now
[03:13:01.880 --> 03:13:06.400]  he's down to YouTube and he expects to disappear from YouTube at any minute so
[03:13:06.400 --> 03:13:11.760]  this is what's happening and leading into 2020 we're going to see this ramp up
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:17.760]  I mean I posted I posted about the Tommy Robinson video with a link to the
[03:13:17.760 --> 03:13:22.240]  YouTube video now it's legit on YouTube right it's still legit not banned on
[03:13:22.240 --> 03:13:28.400]  YouTube the Tommy Robinson panorama video I posted a link to it and I got
[03:13:28.400 --> 03:13:35.080]  another 30-day ban we're within hours I was given my eighth 30-day ban in the
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:40.360]  last 18 months so basically they give me a few weeks then they kick me off for
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:45.480]  another month well this is what they're doing across the board so not only is
[03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:51.160]  Tommy Robinson banned from Facebook now Facebook has has increased the
[03:13:51.160 --> 03:13:57.620]  censorship to where they don't permit you to post about banned people in a
[03:13:57.620 --> 03:14:02.760]  positive way so posting I think that Tommy Robinson got screwed over by
[03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:08.440]  Facebook gets you banned from Facebook I mean this is sounding like the Soviet
[03:14:08.440 --> 03:14:13.680]  Union and just imagine what's going to happen leading into 2020 with all of the
[03:14:13.680 --> 03:14:17.880]  you know you know that the Democrats are going to be doing the vote harvesting
[03:14:17.880 --> 03:14:21.480]  they're going to be harvesting out of the graveyards they're going to be you
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:27.200]  know stashing boxes of extra ballots to push over the close races like in
[03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:32.240]  Orange County or almost in Broward County and the social media is not going
[03:14:32.240 --> 03:14:37.720]  to let us talk about it they're going to to throttle or what do they call it
[03:14:37.720 --> 03:14:43.640]  the now it's called de-boosting so they use algorithms to essentially turn our
[03:14:43.640 --> 03:14:48.920]  volume down we have the illusion of free speech but if it's not really free
[03:14:48.920 --> 03:14:54.680]  speech if your volume is turned down and the left's volume is turned up I mean
[03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:58.320]  it's where we're really getting into a time where we need to start thinking
[03:14:58.320 --> 03:15:04.160]  about alternative social media anywhere that we can find it because you know I
[03:15:04.160 --> 03:15:09.000]  only stay on Facebook sort of to test their censorship and obviously you know
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:12.920]  as a as a guinea pig it's pretty illustrative you know eight months out
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:18.560]  of the last like 16 or 17 months I've been banned you know for nothing just for
[03:15:18.560 --> 03:15:24.120]  being a conservative basically not going along with the program alright when we

[03:21:32.480 --> 03:21:37.720]  know a breach in the relationship but I think the powerful moment for me out of
[03:21:37.720 --> 03:21:45.880]  that whole thing was the red pilling of Joe in regards to post birth infant side
[03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:50.480]  and how you know it's a shocking thing and I think you know I think Joe's gonna
[03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:56.560]  have an awakening when he starts seeing the extreme uncensored ridiculousness
[03:21:56.560 --> 03:22:02.040]  and hypocrisy that's going on and and get it unfiltered so just kudos for Alex
[03:22:02.040 --> 03:22:06.720]  for that on the line yeah that yeah that was that was very that was very big of
[03:22:06.720 --> 03:22:10.360]  both of them to I think that was very big of both of them to sit down together
[03:22:10.360 --> 03:22:16.520]  because it's easy for a few to take on a life of its own and and there's no gain
[03:22:16.520 --> 03:22:21.200]  out of that so go ahead yeah and I think the right thing to do there which they
[03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:27.280]  did was display the First Amendment for a period of time where all of a sudden
[03:22:27.280 --> 03:22:30.640]  things get breached when people have freedom to be able to communicate and
[03:22:30.640 --> 03:22:36.520]  talk and work things through and share ideas good things cannot but come out of
[03:22:36.520 --> 03:22:40.760]  that so so that's wonderful you know but I want to talk about just three quick
[03:22:40.760 --> 03:22:46.160]  points about hypocrisy you know it's the people in the media that make their
[03:22:46.160 --> 03:22:49.800]  living off the First Amendment that are attacking the First Amendment it's the
[03:22:49.800 --> 03:22:57.200]  beneficiaries of capitalism that want socialism and communism and final point
[03:22:57.200 --> 03:23:02.640]  the beneficiaries and this is the one that gets my blood boiling every single
[03:23:02.640 --> 03:23:09.360]  person who is against abortion and infancy is the direct beneficiary of
[03:23:09.360 --> 03:23:16.960]  someone making a pro-choice pro or pro-life excuse me decision and you know I
[03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:21.400]  hear these people crying about all you know I it's gonna cut into my my life
[03:23:21.400 --> 03:23:25.120]  and my entertainment dollars and stuff like that's why I need to have an
[03:23:25.120 --> 03:23:30.320]  abortion you know I watched a woman she was in a flood and I don't know the
[03:23:30.320 --> 03:23:34.720]  video exactly this she's in a flood and she climbed this tree she's nine months
[03:23:34.720 --> 03:23:40.520]  pregnant and she gives birth in the tree you know people have challenges in
[03:23:40.520 --> 03:23:45.320]  their life but you have to at some point man up and say I'm the beneficiary of
[03:23:45.320 --> 03:23:50.780]  all the generations before me and now I'm gonna take the stand of terminating
[03:23:50.780 --> 03:23:56.240]  the people's lives because I just have an inconvenience in my life it's hypocrisy
[03:23:56.240 --> 03:24:00.160]  to the nth degree and I want to say the people on the fence right now
[03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:09.560]  do not be a hypocrite any longer take well it's a take your take the one thing
[03:24:09.560 --> 03:24:15.880]  that God gave us is Jesus Christ and he is God and knowable form Jesus is God
[03:24:15.880 --> 03:24:20.320]  and everything is solved by that we had a caller earlier say that he was in a
[03:24:20.320 --> 03:24:26.240]  you know in a drug haze and and being attacked by demons and it called out in
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:30.320]  the name of Jesus that happened to me in my life and instantly the power over the
[03:24:30.320 --> 03:24:37.800]  demonic broke and that is the true God that is true Jesus Christ authority over
[03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:42.000]  these demons these people are filled with demons and they want a sense of the
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:46.560]  name of Jesus above everything don't be a hypocrite well that's it's even even
[03:24:46.560 --> 03:24:53.200]  in the Supreme Court with the the World War I Memorial Cross in Maryland you
[03:24:53.200 --> 03:24:58.960]  know the demonic forces have to drive God out of our society and when you see
[03:24:58.960 --> 03:25:03.760]  a society where you drop below replacement birth rates it's that's
[03:25:03.760 --> 03:25:08.800]  like a that's evidence right there of an unhealthy society you know even when
[03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:15.280]  biologists bring in a group of of animals from the wild to breed the sign
[03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:21.560]  of their health or lack of health is do they reproduce and we're not reproducing
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:27.200]  this is a very sick and unhealthy culture and I think that they're going
[03:25:27.200 --> 03:25:32.080]  to be calamities ahead of us and I think there will also be a revival and a
[03:25:32.080 --> 03:25:38.480]  rebirth because there are in opposition that there are the godly forces you can
[03:25:38.480 --> 03:25:44.160]  you can say Jesus Christ you know you can include a wider a wider scope for
[03:25:44.160 --> 03:25:49.360]  you know for godliness or natural law even if you're not a particularly
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:54.520]  religious person but the demonic forces are absolutely not only against
[03:25:54.520 --> 03:26:01.280]  Christianity they are against they are against natural law you know I think it
[03:26:01.280 --> 03:26:06.200]  was in the Gospel of Matthew where he's recording Jesus as saying you know it
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:11.240]  would be better for anyone that leads these children into sin to have a
[03:26:11.240 --> 03:26:16.320]  millstone put around their neck and cast them into a lake well our whole
[03:26:16.320 --> 03:26:21.880]  society right now is sexualizing children it's a very deviant and perverted
[03:26:21.880 --> 03:26:26.800]  culture and you know there's there's going to be a break I mean we've got
[03:26:26.800 --> 03:26:31.280]  these sexual deviants and Bolsheviks on the left and they're not going to quit
[03:26:31.280 --> 03:26:36.200]  you know they are they're in for this next race I think they're going to pull
[03:26:36.200 --> 03:26:41.120]  out all the stops to do what they did in Orange County California anything that's
[03:26:41.120 --> 03:26:45.480]  within a few percentage points they're just going to haul in truck loads of
[03:26:45.480 --> 03:26:51.320]  ballots and then say we won and that's it and you know I don't know at what
[03:26:51.320 --> 03:26:55.920]  point the the civil war starts but we're already seeing false flags
[03:26:55.920 --> 03:27:01.400]  Jesse Smallette was a classic false flag imagine if he had gotten away with
[03:27:01.400 --> 03:27:05.800]  it if he had not been quite as stupid if there had been video that they tried to
[03:27:05.800 --> 03:27:09.320]  get under the camera but the camera was pointing the wrong way if there had been
[03:27:09.320 --> 03:27:14.480]  video of quote-unquote Trump supporters beating up a black gay man I mean it
[03:27:14.480 --> 03:27:17.760]  would have we right now would be possibly in the middle of race riots
[03:27:17.760 --> 03:27:23.440]  already and his intention was to build up anger against white men Trump
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:27.560]  supporters you know this is this is a classic false flag and thank God it was
[03:27:27.560 --> 03:27:32.840]  revealed at the last moment we don't have really enough time for another call
[03:27:32.840 --> 03:27:37.160]  in this segment we are going to come back to calls but I just want to I just
[03:27:37.160 --> 03:27:42.360]  want to tell people this is the time now to prepare you know we don't know the
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:47.040]  day or the hour that we're gonna you know flip the light switch in the morning

[03:32:55.160 --> 03:33:16.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[03:33:16.920 --> 03:33:27.680]  worldwide it's alex jones and now your host Matt Bracken what a time to be
[03:33:27.680 --> 03:33:34.240]  alive yeah I was watching some of the Cohen hearings yesterday that Soviet
[03:33:34.240 --> 03:33:40.560]  style show trial media trial it was pretty pretty amazing at times not very
[03:33:40.560 --> 03:33:46.880]  surprising but the main takeaway that I get from it is what would you do
[03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:51.560]  if you know you weren't a perfect guy and maybe you had done a few scams here
[03:33:51.560 --> 03:33:56.360]  and here and there along the way but your real crime is being associated with
[03:33:56.360 --> 03:34:02.880]  Donald Trump and the feds come at you with full force and you're already over
[03:34:02.880 --> 03:34:08.960]  60 and they're gonna put you in a very hard federal penitentiary for 70 years
[03:34:08.960 --> 03:34:16.000]  that's what's on the table 70 years hard time in a hellhole federal pen or if
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:22.680]  you become a wind-up doll if you you know accept the you know the script
[03:34:22.680 --> 03:34:30.040]  you'll get three years in a in a club fed Otisville where instead of doing
[03:34:30.040 --> 03:34:36.360]  hard time you do card time you know playing gin with your buds in the open
[03:34:36.360 --> 03:34:44.080]  in the in the in the in the day room no cell doors easy days three years in
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:49.600]  club fed or die in a federal penitentiary you know maybe not even live
[03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:55.600]  out your life because you'll get shanked would you have the character to say no I
[03:34:55.600 --> 03:35:03.520]  won't do it and imagine the pressure right now on Jerome Corsi and and our
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:10.000]  own Roger Stone imagine the pressure that these men are under you know you're
[03:35:10.000 --> 03:35:16.920]  going to die in prison unless you become a purge a paid perjurer for corrupt
[03:35:16.920 --> 03:35:22.920]  DA's I hope that none of us are ever put in that position but I hope that we
[03:35:22.920 --> 03:35:29.640]  would have the the the integrity and the courage to never become a liar just to
[03:35:29.640 --> 03:35:34.200]  ease our own burden and you know there are people in prison languishing in
[03:35:34.200 --> 03:35:39.400]  prison that have been set up and totally you know legally raped not
[03:35:39.400 --> 03:35:44.240]  everybody in prison deserves to be there and you know I've heard from some of
[03:35:44.240 --> 03:35:49.560]  them and from some of their wives people who have been set up and crucified you
[03:35:49.560 --> 03:35:54.920]  know and and it makes you wonder what would happen if you know if you saw the
[03:35:54.920 --> 03:35:59.000]  fed swarm in your house at five in the morning and you knew what was coming
[03:35:59.000 --> 03:36:04.120]  after that would be eventually a choice between 70 years in prison dying a hard
[03:36:04.120 --> 03:36:10.480]  time fed pen or three years in a club fed what would you take what would be the
[03:36:10.480 --> 03:36:15.440]  price of your integrity and your honor and that's what we saw yesterday we saw
[03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:20.920]  one guy that he obviously took the easy deal and became a mouthpiece for the
[03:36:20.920 --> 03:36:28.400]  feds okay let's go back to the phones now I see Daniel in Missouri wants to
[03:36:28.400 --> 03:36:34.560]  talk about Joe Rogan what else go ahead Daniel yeah so I I just listened to the
[03:36:34.560 --> 03:36:42.000]  podcast with Joe Rogan there and I heard Alex talking about when he was
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:49.040]  having dreams as a child and kind of falling closing his eyes and falling
[03:36:49.040 --> 03:36:53.280]  back into a blackness of vortex I know this sounds crazy and I kind of feel
[03:36:53.280 --> 03:36:57.440]  silly talking about it but I've had I've had the same experiences I'm
[03:36:57.440 --> 03:37:03.280]  wondering who all if other people have had the same experiences and here's what
[03:37:03.280 --> 03:37:09.000]  my mind has gathered from it God has called us apart from this world early
[03:37:09.000 --> 03:37:14.360]  early in our lives and has prepared us all for this time and I'm just calling
[03:37:14.360 --> 03:37:20.880]  on all the men in this country to gather yourselves and calm yourselves and
[03:37:20.880 --> 03:37:27.160]  prepare yourselves consecrate yourselves and and and just get your house in order
[03:37:27.160 --> 03:37:31.920]  get your mind in order because you are women and our children are in desperate
[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:36.400]  need of us right now and I want to read something it this is not biblical it's
[03:37:36.400 --> 03:37:40.600]  not it's out of the meditations of Marcus Aurelius it really struck me
[03:37:40.600 --> 03:37:45.280]  yesterday the reason I'm reading this because when I try to communicate with
[03:37:45.280 --> 03:37:50.320]  people I get super emotional when I when I try to relay all this information
[03:37:50.320 --> 03:37:54.680]  right it makes me mad what they're doing to the babies makes me mad what
[03:37:54.680 --> 03:38:00.480]  they're doing to our psyche our minds when I think about it but we have to
[03:38:00.480 --> 03:38:04.880]  gather ourselves men out there that are here in my voice I want to read this to
[03:38:04.880 --> 03:38:11.280]  you and along with not getting angry at others try not to pander either both are
[03:38:11.280 --> 03:38:16.440]  forms of selfishness both of them will do you harm when you start to lose your
[03:38:16.440 --> 03:38:21.600]  temper remember there's nothing manly about rage it's courtesy and kindness
[03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:27.440]  that define a human being and a man that's who possesses strength and nerves
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:33.840]  and guts not angry whiners to react like that brings you closer to impassivity
[03:38:33.840 --> 03:38:39.880]  not so to strength pain is the opposite of strength and so is anger both things
[03:38:39.880 --> 03:38:43.560]  we suffer from and yield to
[03:38:43.560 --> 03:38:53.240]  go ahead we are going to have to guard ourselves for battle on many levels
[03:38:53.240 --> 03:39:01.160]  you know when you when you see such evil as infanticide being legalized you
[03:39:01.160 --> 03:39:06.520]  know fair all the way through third trimester and after and when you see you
[03:39:06.520 --> 03:39:14.840]  know young children being turned into into a transsexual you know props for
[03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:20.360]  deviance and this is praised and lauded on network television you know with a
[03:39:20.360 --> 03:39:26.320]  clapping studio audience you know I don't know where the big battle will be
[03:39:26.320 --> 03:39:30.120]  when you know the balloon goes up for all of us at once but all of us in our
[03:39:30.120 --> 03:39:33.920]  own time on our own days we're gonna have to be faced with these I would like
[03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:38.400]  to think that that if I was in a studio audience where they were you know
[03:39:38.400 --> 03:39:44.080]  cheering for you know transsexual strippers that are 11 years old that I
[03:39:44.080 --> 03:39:50.360]  would get up and shout do something we can't just hold our our peace or hold
[03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:55.960]  our silence not when evil is so rampant you know this is one of the points of
[03:39:55.960 --> 03:40:01.360]  of political correctness it political correctness is a way of forcing us to
[03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:07.000]  shut up about the evil that the left is doing by calling it hate any
[03:40:07.000 --> 03:40:14.200]  disagreement with the left whether it's infanticide or child deviancy if you
[03:40:14.200 --> 03:40:18.440]  protest against it you're called you're called a hater even Martina
[03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:23.640]  let Navratilova whose gay tennis player she's been you know kicked out of the
[03:40:23.640 --> 03:40:30.400]  left club for saying that it's not fair for biological men who claim that they're
[03:40:30.400 --> 03:40:35.680]  women to compete against women I mean we're in such a crazy time that we have
[03:40:35.680 --> 03:40:41.920]  you know grown adults on network television looking at a man and saying
[03:40:41.920 --> 03:40:46.860]  yes it's a woman this is Alice in Wonderland this is through the looking
[03:40:46.860 --> 03:40:51.840]  glass you know this is this is a very dark time and when a country becomes so
[03:40:51.840 --> 03:40:57.240]  delusional it's going to go off the rails in some other ways if the Democrats
[03:40:57.240 --> 03:41:05.000]  went in 2020 God help us I see total gun control I see all kind of of laws
[03:41:05.000 --> 03:41:09.600]  being passed that would push us toward you know some kind of a civil war because
[03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:16.280]  we won't just quit I'm sorry you have any final comment there Daniel point and
[03:41:16.280 --> 03:41:22.280]  all that so my circle is very low very small right I'm a family man I don't I

[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:32.200]  my me me bringing all that up is for all the men out here to my mind is kind of
[03:41:32.200 --> 03:41:36.800]  get my mind get my house in order right so when I speak to my wife or my
[03:41:36.800 --> 03:41:41.880]  family about things like this they when we get emotional and go over the top

[03:41:47.560 --> 03:41:55.280]  we we know we all can feel it's coming and right now I feel like it's a chance

[03:47:31.360 --> 03:47:36.880]  to be fair to everybody there's gosh a ton of people lined up we're gonna try
[03:47:36.880 --> 03:47:43.440]  to get more than one one or two calls in during a segment so I'm not gonna make
[03:47:43.440 --> 03:47:46.960]  it much of a conversation I'll just let people have to have a have a chance to
[03:47:46.960 --> 03:47:52.840]  speak wild in Wisconsin been hanging on for a while wants to discuss rogan and
[03:47:52.840 --> 03:48:01.680]  Jones go ahead yeah I wanted to drop some pieces in that that were kind of overlooked or not mentioned
[03:48:01.680 --> 03:48:08.280]  one thing that's important to remember is just how there was indoctrination camps
[03:48:08.280 --> 03:48:14.880]  previously for Marxism they're currently going on in the guise of music festivals
[03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:21.840]  whether if Vegas was involved in that I don't know but that's one thing to look
[03:48:21.840 --> 03:48:31.280]  at and secondly as George Norris said about his experience in South America
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:38.840]  is a difference between taking an intoxicant and having a trip or spiritual
[03:48:38.840 --> 03:48:44.680]  experience and a difference between near-death experiences and doing it
[03:48:44.680 --> 03:48:49.880]  without an intoxicant without an intoxicant obviously you're not intoxicated
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:55.040]  therefore where's this where's this is this coming around to Joe Rogan and Alex
[03:48:55.040 --> 03:49:08.000]  yeah because they were talking about a DMT trips and ceremonies like that yeah
[03:49:08.000 --> 03:49:14.840]  I personally I don't recommend tripping I know too many people that that burned
[03:49:14.840 --> 03:49:19.640]  themselves out you know you you hold those electrodes to your brain for too
[03:49:19.640 --> 03:49:26.160]  long and you're gonna absolutely fry some permanently so yeah I don't have a
[03:49:26.160 --> 03:49:32.840]  lot of experience with tripping I'm not ashamed to admit yeah Tracy and Georgia
[03:49:32.840 --> 03:49:37.640]  we're just gonna go down the line Tracy and Georgia what does it you say 9-11
[03:49:37.640 --> 03:49:44.320]  changed everything go ahead Tracy hey are you doing mr. Brackie I'm fine
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:49.560]  thanks I'm basically 9-11 to me put fear into the
[03:49:49.560 --> 03:49:55.080]  Americans heart simply after that that's when the political correct culture came
[03:49:55.080 --> 03:50:00.680]  that's when we were basically after our quote-unquote hatred for the Islamic
[03:50:00.680 --> 03:50:05.360]  state the Muslims and everything like that we kind of went backwards and the
[03:50:05.360 --> 03:50:12.760]  political correct culture came in and basically made it made us want to
[03:50:12.760 --> 03:50:24.240]  basically you be nice if you will well yeah that I am I see 9-11 as being part
[03:50:24.240 --> 03:50:29.560]  of something has been going on for 1400 years unbroken and you know there's a
[03:50:29.560 --> 03:50:34.760]  lot of great cultures and societies have thought Islam that's nothing to worry
[03:50:34.760 --> 03:50:39.800]  about who gives a damn and guess what now they're Islamic it happened in
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:43.760]  Christian Egypt it happened in Christian Turkey and you can go right down the
[03:50:43.760 --> 03:50:48.720]  list so that there's something about Islam that makes it very unique it's a
[03:50:48.720 --> 03:50:54.800]  very sinister and powerful formula for conquest you don't have to be the
[03:50:54.800 --> 03:50:59.680]  smartest you don't have to be the strongest it's like a a social virus
[03:50:59.680 --> 03:51:05.000]  that gets inside of a healthy society and gradually takes it over from within
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:10.280]  and from with it from without by making people afraid to resist it because always
[03:51:10.280 --> 03:51:13.360]  in the back of your mind you know there's the thought that somebody might
[03:51:13.360 --> 03:51:18.720]  come around you know with a knife or a bomb they'll use bribery they'll use
[03:51:18.720 --> 03:51:25.440]  lies anything so anybody that thinks that that puts something that's a thousand
[03:51:25.440 --> 03:51:30.000]  four hundred years old and very successful with very few setbacks only
[03:51:30.000 --> 03:51:35.320]  Spain and Israel our territories that have been reconquered from from you
[03:51:35.320 --> 03:51:40.440]  know from Islam once it's in it's in it's like it's got hooks that can't be
[03:51:40.440 --> 03:51:48.080]  pulled out so I see this commonly also with people who blame everything on the
[03:51:48.080 --> 03:51:52.800]  bankers or blame everything on the Jews it's a very simplistic worldview to say
[03:51:52.800 --> 03:51:58.840]  oh our country is fine and and the you know there is no Muslim threat well you
[03:51:58.840 --> 03:52:03.520]  know tell that to all you know that the many many countries that were strong and
[03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:08.920]  thriving and are now today Islamic they were all taken over by it it's a very
[03:52:08.920 --> 03:52:15.040]  serious threat you know Chris in Illinois let's go back to Joe Rogan go
[03:52:15.040 --> 03:52:21.400]  ahead Chris hey Matt good afternoon yeah that that was a great interview and I
[03:52:21.400 --> 03:52:25.600]  think what I think the thing that I find it's gonna be effective is sort of this
[03:52:25.600 --> 03:52:29.520]  coalition of conservatives and not even service of people that are you know
[03:52:29.520 --> 03:52:35.640]  allowing free speech such as Joe Rogan Alex going on Joe Rogan culture with
[03:52:35.640 --> 03:52:42.120]  Ali Alexander info wars you know all of these guys getting together and you know
[03:52:42.120 --> 03:52:45.760]  coming together and putting any differences aside just to sort of
[03:52:45.760 --> 03:52:51.080]  unite you know that makes sense yeah sure yesterday was massive I mean there's
[03:52:51.080 --> 03:52:56.480]  been more than three million views of a four hour and 40 minute podcast I mean
[03:52:56.480 --> 03:53:01.080]  imagine that that's that's got to make the network talking heads if they had
[03:53:01.080 --> 03:53:06.860]  any sense take notice those are huge numbers that are happening outside of
[03:53:06.860 --> 03:53:13.840]  the of their control you know Joe Rogan I've I'm not a huge fan but the fact
[03:53:13.840 --> 03:53:18.600]  that you know that they can get back together and I think Alex not only you
[03:53:18.600 --> 03:53:24.840]  know helped red pill Joe but I think that so many people watched the podcast
[03:53:24.840 --> 03:53:29.680]  that millions of more people were red-pilled yesterday and that's it's
[03:53:29.680 --> 03:53:34.480]  vital I mean that's that's huge it's huge and you know what you see is what
[03:53:34.480 --> 03:53:38.680]  you get with Alex he's he's he's unfiltered you know when he when he
[03:53:38.680 --> 03:53:44.040]  gets in front of a microphone like that it's what is he is thinking is what he
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:49.040]  is going to express sometimes obviously it gets him into trouble because he can
[03:53:49.040 --> 03:53:54.960]  he can go down a thought pattern you know where he's playing out permutations
[03:53:54.960 --> 03:54:01.320]  and it can and it can start sounding absurd but what he's doing is he's taking
[03:54:01.320 --> 03:54:06.560]  something to logical conclusions and this has him branded today as a
[03:54:06.560 --> 03:54:11.720]  conspiracy theorist but look at how many of the conspiracy theories turned out
[03:54:11.720 --> 03:54:16.400]  not to be conspiracy theories but actual true conspiracies or just hidden
[03:54:16.400 --> 03:54:21.160]  truth yep I'm sorry for taking your time you got a little more there Chris go
[03:54:21.160 --> 03:54:28.080]  ahead yeah so listen I'm in Chicago and I work for a food distributor and I'm
[03:54:28.080 --> 03:54:33.400]  telling you man during that cold snap we had to close for a day and we supplied
[03:54:33.400 --> 03:54:38.560]  a restaurant and I and after just after one day of pretty much shutting the
[03:54:38.560 --> 03:54:44.080]  city down the grocery stores were in bad shape you know these restaurants were in
[03:54:44.080 --> 03:54:50.480]  bad shape one day so I think to heed your advice to get everybody knowing
[03:54:50.480 --> 03:54:57.040]  their neighbors firearms training getting a bug out bag so on and so forth
[03:54:57.040 --> 03:55:01.120]  the other thing is I wanted to get your opinion on Joel Scow's and strategic
[03:55:01.120 --> 03:55:05.360]  relocation I wanted to you know I live in the Southwest numbers and I have a
[03:55:05.360 --> 03:55:10.920]  good exit strategy out of the Scotland area to get over to the Midwest where
[03:55:10.920 --> 03:55:17.800]  I have some family family property but you know what's your opinion on on that
[03:55:17.800 --> 03:55:23.080]  and any other good resources as far as mapping your way out of the large
[03:55:23.080 --> 03:55:29.400]  population centers well if there's a mass exodus from the cities because you
[03:55:29.400 --> 03:55:34.600]  know for example the stores were all looted and there's no food there's no
[03:55:34.600 --> 03:55:40.160]  sanitation and there's no water bugging out is going to be a really grim
[03:55:40.160 --> 03:55:46.160]  proposition I would advise anybody that's been considering it get away from
[03:55:46.160 --> 03:55:51.480]  big cities do it now even if there's a big cut in pay even if you can't work
[03:55:51.480 --> 03:55:56.360]  in your chosen profession at full salary I mean even if you've if you've got to
[03:55:56.360 --> 03:56:01.880]  take a major reduction in salary get away from the big cities you know when
[03:56:01.880 --> 03:56:08.840]  when the s hits the fan after the first few months there's going to be a vast
[03:56:08.840 --> 03:56:14.520]  reorganization of our country simply because the blue hives of the cities
[03:56:14.520 --> 03:56:21.360]  they'll be burning and they're going to be depopulating you know I hope that it
[03:56:21.360 --> 03:56:27.040]  never comes to this but looking at all of these social confluences and global
[03:56:27.040 --> 03:56:32.960]  global and social and cultural economic confluences I see us heading for
[03:56:32.960 --> 03:56:38.360]  something that's disastrous on an unparalleled in history scale and I
[03:56:38.360 --> 03:56:42.920]  don't want to be anywhere near a megapolis when it happens so that number
[03:56:42.920 --> 03:56:47.280]  one is I wouldn't plan on bugging out from Chicago you're just going to get
[03:56:47.280 --> 03:56:52.640]  caught in some massive gridlock you know where everybody's just at a choke
[03:56:52.640 --> 03:56:58.720]  point fighting each other for the you know until their cannibals are I get
[03:56:58.720 --> 03:57:03.280]  away from big cities is my biggest advice and anything else Chris as we
[03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:09.480]  finished out the hour well I can tell you the last word yes sir thank you for
[03:57:09.480 --> 03:57:14.240]  that the I have some friends that I've made contact with again I haven't hung
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:16.880]  out with him like ten years and we used to raise a lot of hell together and it's
[03:57:16.880 --> 03:57:21.920]  kind of weird how we're all sort of turning back to God shall we say you
[03:57:21.920 --> 03:57:26.480]  know because okay Chris like Chris we got I guess your point there we're
[03:57:26.480 --> 03:57:29.800]  running right right to the end of the hour I think people are seeing now how
[03:57:29.800 --> 03:57:34.680]  serious it is you know child deviancy and phantasy folks if this doesn't wake
[03:57:34.680 --> 03:57:38.760]  you up I don't know what it's gonna take you know it's prepare prepare your
[03:57:38.760 --> 03:57:44.240]  physical and your spiritual self prepare I've been doing a lot of research
[03:57:44.240 --> 03:57:50.680]  into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of
[03:57:50.680 --> 03:57:57.000]  video that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed and that's
[03:57:57.000 --> 03:58:03.440]  the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist
[03:58:03.440 --> 03:58:08.320]  authoritarians like the young turds and others it's so but hurt when Trump won
[03:58:08.320 --> 03:58:12.640]  they don't want us to have that victory they don't want us to remember what
[03:58:12.640 --> 03:58:17.960]  political action did and that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying
[03:58:17.960 --> 03:58:22.760]  to shut in fours down this is a fight about taking your speech away not just
[03:58:22.760 --> 03:58:26.760]  my speech about taking your very sovereignty away this country is in a
[03:58:26.760 --> 03:58:31.360]  war so again I want to thank you for what you've done but I want to remind you
