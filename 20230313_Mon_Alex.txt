[00:00.000 --> 00:10.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Monday, March 13th, 2023, and Biden is now executing one of the
[00:10.680 --> 00:15.640]  biggest bailouts in U.S. history and saying it's not a bailout.
[00:15.640 --> 00:20.120]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:20.120 --> 00:27.760]  All right, I am not what you call a banking financial expert on the nuts and bolts of
[00:27.760 --> 00:33.600]  it, but I am an expert compared, I guess, to the general public or even mainline analyst
[00:33.600 --> 00:36.960]  on studying the monetary system and who owns it and controls it, and how things really
[00:36.960 --> 00:39.760]  run and the history of it.
[00:39.760 --> 00:45.120]  And so I won't be using a lot of their technical terms here, but in general parlance, I have
[00:45.120 --> 00:46.120]  a very good handle.
[00:46.120 --> 00:50.640]  I've been doing a lot of studying since Friday on what's really happening with this big
[00:50.640 --> 00:54.160]  banking crisis that we're in, and it's big, okay?
[00:54.160 --> 00:58.760]  I don't think you should run and try to get your money out of the bank in most cases,
[00:58.760 --> 01:02.240]  and I'll break down some of the banks, obviously, that you need to get money out of.
[01:02.240 --> 01:07.800]  But if your bank stock is down 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, and hundreds of them are
[01:07.800 --> 01:13.200]  down right now, especially regional lending banks, then, yeah, you should get your money
[01:13.200 --> 01:14.200]  out of there.
[01:14.200 --> 01:16.320]  Mui pronto.
[01:16.320 --> 01:26.440]  And if Biden is saying that any deposit, not just over $250,000, is guaranteed.
[01:26.440 --> 01:29.920]  Now, the FDIC is out of money.
[01:29.920 --> 01:36.200]  It's already spent $300 billion since Friday, 170 something on SVBs, still a kind of alley
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.960]  bank and on a bunch of others, and as of today, it looks like it'll be hundreds of billions
[01:40.960 --> 01:41.960]  more.
[01:41.960 --> 01:45.480]  They're out of money, they only had $300 billion in there.
[01:45.480 --> 01:47.320]  So where's that going to come from?
[01:47.320 --> 01:49.320]  That is a bailout.
[01:49.320 --> 01:54.200]  And I understand on the surface, you've got to do that, or it'll bring down the entire
[01:54.200 --> 02:00.640]  system will be back to 1929, back to the future from the past, back to the future.
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.960]  So there's a lot of moving pieces here, and the globalists aren't in full control of this,
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.880]  but they'll definitely use it for their advantage and to bring in the central bank digital currencies,
[02:10.880 --> 02:11.880]  which they're already saying.
[02:11.880 --> 02:18.440]  So I have a stack here, I have several stacks here of over 100 articles that we're going
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.480]  to try our best to just go over these, cover different angles of it.
[02:23.480 --> 02:29.920]  But bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, this was absolutely caused by the Federal Reserve's
[02:29.920 --> 02:35.400]  quantitative easing that's been going on since 2008, just quadrillions pumped out mainly
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.640]  to themselves, then loaned out to the public, and now the Federal Reserve raising interest
[02:39.640 --> 02:41.360]  rates in the last year.
[02:41.360 --> 02:48.920]  And if they don't stop the rate hikes, they were set next week to raise them, they set
[02:48.920 --> 02:55.280]  again, and I think if they don't cut rates back about half what they've already done,
[02:55.280 --> 02:56.280]  that this is going to happen.
[02:56.280 --> 02:59.680]  And this is all because of rate hikes.
[02:59.680 --> 03:04.080]  And I understand we're going to have worse inflation if they don't do that, but we already
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.400]  had the inflation with the bank runs, it's stagflation, it's everywhere.
[03:09.400 --> 03:13.680]  This is just a zombie economy, ladies and gentlemen, where the ultra rich are making
[03:13.680 --> 03:16.480]  record profits and the general public can't even fill up their gas tank.
[03:16.480 --> 03:22.400]  So I'm going to do my best to cover this in the first hour in great detail.
[03:22.400 --> 03:27.600]  Then I just got this news when we went live, the judge suspended court Thursday and Friday
[03:27.600 --> 03:31.680]  in the Proud Boys case that affects us all, we're being branded as terrorists and we love
[03:31.680 --> 03:33.560]  America.
[03:33.560 --> 03:41.080]  And the judge said no misconduct by the feds with documents saying they destroyed evidence
[03:41.080 --> 03:44.760]  and actually handing over the documents to the Proud Boys defense.
[03:44.760 --> 03:48.640]  And the judge is declared national security and says that they're just allowed to engage
[03:48.640 --> 03:49.640]  in fraud.
[03:49.640 --> 03:53.840]  In any other case in history, you have a man coming on Bob in the next hour who was in
[03:53.840 --> 03:58.960]  a famous case with the Bundy ranch situation and their case was thrown out because the
[03:58.960 --> 04:02.080]  feds got caught destroying evidence.
[04:02.080 --> 04:04.960]  That is a default position, even with liberal judges.
[04:04.960 --> 04:08.120]  Well, this is a Republican Trump appointed judge that is doing this.
[04:08.120 --> 04:12.560]  It's very, very dangerous precedent, but look at my gangaroo cases.
[04:12.560 --> 04:16.280]  Literally the judges said I was guilty, so we handed over no documents and they proceeded
[04:16.280 --> 04:21.200]  to show all the documents out of context, twisted, and we couldn't even mount a defense
[04:21.200 --> 04:30.640]  when they would misrepresent gross sales of $400 million over 10 years as $400 million
[04:30.640 --> 04:33.640]  that I have.
[04:33.640 --> 04:36.960]  When at the time of the last court hearing I had about a million bucks, now I have less
[04:36.960 --> 04:37.960]  than that.
[04:37.960 --> 04:42.440]  I mean, just unbelievable levels of deception.
[04:42.440 --> 04:46.240]  It's all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:46.240 --> 04:48.440]  This is going to be a very important transmission.
[04:48.440 --> 04:51.600]  I don't think you need me to tell you that, but a lot of folks looking for the truth.
[04:51.600 --> 04:54.120]  They'll say, hey, you want to find out what's really going on?
[04:54.120 --> 05:01.840]  Get in the link right now to madmaxworld.tv.
[05:01.840 --> 05:05.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, is a historic
[05:05.800 --> 05:10.040]  book that documents the globals and their own words planned for our future, that is
[05:10.040 --> 05:11.040]  the hellish future.
[05:11.040 --> 05:14.920]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess, that are starting to ban them,
[05:14.920 --> 05:18.840]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[05:18.840 --> 05:23.120]  amazon, or m4chore.com, but you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[05:23.120 --> 05:28.080]  book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about 1,000 left of them right
[05:28.080 --> 05:29.080]  now.
[05:29.080 --> 05:34.360]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at m4chore.com.
[05:34.360 --> 05:38.280]  And there is a markup there, because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[05:38.280 --> 05:42.120]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book, you'll also know that
[05:42.120 --> 05:43.840]  you help keep m4chores on the air.
[05:43.840 --> 05:47.400]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned
[05:47.400 --> 05:52.640]  copies, but I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to m4chore.com and get
[05:52.640 --> 05:57.440]  a signed copy and buy a couple unsigned copies and go into the library or get them to the
[05:57.440 --> 05:58.440]  local school.
[05:58.440 --> 06:28.280]  This is an Info War, I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[06:29.360 --> 06:36.080]  Nuclear War, they always told us the New World Order was going to really be a bad thing.
[06:36.080 --> 06:38.600]  It sure sucks, doesn't it?
[06:38.600 --> 06:43.400]  But at least we've got our souls and a great God that loves us, and we'll just remember
[06:43.400 --> 06:49.360]  that God and go back to God and repent he will heal our land in our future.
[06:49.360 --> 06:59.440]  Okay, wow, I know exactly what's going on, not in some banking technical gobbledygut
[06:59.440 --> 07:03.600]  language nobody can understand, but just from studying history and monetary systems and
[07:03.600 --> 07:08.200]  what's happening, it's very simple.
[07:08.200 --> 07:14.960]  Since 2008, quadrillions of fiat currency has been pumped into the world economy by
[07:14.960 --> 07:20.520]  the major nations of the world, the United States has led that just in the first two
[07:20.520 --> 07:24.320]  years of the Biden administration.
[07:24.320 --> 07:31.960]  There were half as many dollars issued and printed as had ever been put out since the
[07:31.960 --> 07:37.080]  founding of the country 250 years ago.
[07:37.080 --> 07:43.320]  And then as soon as the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates, last year we began
[07:43.320 --> 07:45.360]  to see what's happening now.
[07:45.360 --> 07:56.360]  There's a lot of other factors that go into this, but there has been a bedlam like orgy
[07:56.360 --> 08:03.960]  of banks, mainly the big six global banks, buying up everything including the kitchen
[08:03.960 --> 08:12.880]  sink, infrastructure, intellectual property, farmland, every major and even small tech
[08:12.880 --> 08:17.720]  startup, this has been a vertical integration of vertical integrations.
[08:17.720 --> 08:21.560]  Now they're going to bring down the stock market in my view in the next few years, they're
[08:21.560 --> 08:25.800]  going to really squeeze the general population, their own words, to where they won't need
[08:25.800 --> 08:30.880]  to be an official lockdown, you won't have money to put gas in your car, much less even
[08:30.880 --> 08:31.880]  get food.
[08:31.880 --> 08:39.920]  So there's a lot of facets to this, but you know we've been predicting it like a parent
[08:39.920 --> 08:48.080]  on methamphetamine, I have just been chirping and quacking the fact that the next big move
[08:48.080 --> 08:57.040]  will be a financial crisis precipitated by bank failures and or a cyber attack on the
[08:57.040 --> 09:01.120]  Russians or the Chinese.
[09:01.120 --> 09:10.040]  And again I don't have some crucifile view of the Russians, but they're not even players
[09:10.040 --> 09:20.160]  when it comes to this, China and the people running the US and the EU are the big dogs.
[09:20.160 --> 09:27.800]  And I don't know yet if this was deliberately triggered last week at SVB, but it probably
[09:27.800 --> 09:34.240]  was because the head of the company took out $3.6 million three days before it imploded
[09:34.240 --> 09:42.600]  and they also took their bonuses on Friday right before the feds took the bank over.
[09:42.600 --> 09:47.320]  We know they've been in deep talks with the feds for months to prop the bank up, which
[09:47.320 --> 09:53.040]  would have cost a couple billion dollars, it's estimated, they're so leveraged, they could
[09:53.040 --> 10:01.080]  have leveraged that, instead now it's up to $300 billion, $170 billion of it, plus pumped
[10:01.080 --> 10:02.080]  into SVB.
[10:02.080 --> 10:08.040]  So again there's a lot of angles, a lot of facets to this, but when you have Joe Biden
[10:08.040 --> 10:11.920]  running around saying don't worry the economy is strong, don't worry it's the best of Superman,
[10:11.920 --> 10:16.240]  don't worry the banks are solvent, that does not create confidence because anything he
[10:16.240 --> 10:17.240]  says we know is the opposite.
[10:17.240 --> 10:22.240]  It's like I've got to play the clip Sunday, will you guys give me the Jim Kramer clip?
[10:22.240 --> 10:28.640]  It's Carlson talking about it, where Jim Kramer just two weeks ago said SVB is the best, it's
[10:28.640 --> 10:33.400]  the place to invest, he did that with Lehman Brothers right before it went under, he does
[10:33.400 --> 10:37.640]  this over and over again, his job is when the big guys are sucking the money out the
[10:37.640 --> 10:45.480]  back door, he gets more people in the front door, in my view, historically that's a fact.
[10:45.480 --> 10:50.000]  So let's go ahead and run down through this, but if you remember about a month ago we started
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.160]  pointing out there were already bank runs, it looked like happening that the media was
[10:53.160 --> 10:58.320]  covering up at Wells Fargo, at Bank of America and a lot of other places and that's really
[10:58.320 --> 11:08.200]  the biggest news today is dozens of large regional mainly lending banks, those are banks that
[11:08.200 --> 11:14.440]  still do what banks are supposed to do, they have had massive stock slides.
[11:14.440 --> 11:20.640]  So let's just go through some of these headlines, we'll try to comment on each one and then
[11:20.640 --> 11:25.200]  get to the meat potatoes on this and where I think this is going.
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.760]  US regulators say SVB customers will be made whole as second bank fails, by the way I wish
[11:30.760 --> 11:33.680]  I'd have broke this Friday, I called one of my banking connections, he's pretty high
[11:33.680 --> 11:38.520]  up, he said, I don't really have any big inside news but I can tell you signature failed,
[11:38.520 --> 11:42.440]  that didn't break until Sunday, he knew it had failed, I thought oh then everybody must
[11:42.440 --> 11:47.480]  know it failed, he just said it very matter of factly, but that news did not come out
[11:47.480 --> 11:51.000]  until Sunday.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.720]  So what's the big takeaway here, oh there's no bailout, just anybody over $20,000 or under
[11:56.720 --> 12:02.240]  that you'll be made whole, well that's potentially the biggest bailout ever heard of if these
[12:02.240 --> 12:11.880]  bank runs continue and the FDIC is already exhausted, it's funds it had reserved for ensuring
[12:11.880 --> 12:17.000]  people's deposits, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.040]  Here's another one ladies and gentlemen, beds and new backstop shields banks from 300 billion
[12:24.040 --> 12:29.640]  in losses, but that's just so far, they're out of money, Yahoo Finance, Biden vows to
[12:29.640 --> 12:34.720]  hold those responsible Silicon Valley bank failure fully accountable, so the Fox will
[12:34.720 --> 12:39.760]  hold the weasels accountable for attacking the in-house, outrageous Silicon Valley bank
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.080]  provided massive amounts of capital in Chinese tech ventures, now Biden FDIC and Federal
[12:44.080 --> 12:49.040]  Revenue are bailing it out, clearly Biden's working with China, yes it's a bailout, people
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.840]  are like Gateway Pundit says it's a bailout, no it's not, they promised no bailouts, Janet
[12:53.840 --> 13:00.000]  Yellen at the Federal Reserve said so, that's a bailout folks, they're doing it for everybody,
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.160]  not just people who had deposits of $200,000 but other people that were invested in the
[13:05.160 --> 13:06.160]  bank.
[13:06.160 --> 13:12.880]  The U.S. government moves to stop potential banking crisis, AP, U.S. regional banks remain
[13:12.880 --> 13:20.400]  under pressure as First Republic sinks, First Republic banks 67% drop in stock today, Western
[13:20.400 --> 13:28.480]  Alliance Bank Corp, 76%, biggest drop ever, PAC West Bank Corp was down 41, hitting a
[13:28.480 --> 13:37.080]  record low, here's a list of more of them, Key Core Bank down 28 plus percent, Zion's
[13:37.080 --> 13:48.800]  Bank 26%, First Republic 76, PAC West 47, it just goes on and on, Charles Swab is down
[13:48.800 --> 13:53.920]  16, normally the bank was down 5 points today, it's a huge deal, latest bank to collapse
[13:53.920 --> 14:02.480]  the same one that closed Trump's account after January 6, signature, and Donald Trump Jr.
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.120]  is making it a political issue, pointing out that the bank was heavily involved promoting
[14:08.120 --> 14:15.720]  trans-generism and the rest of it, here's the domino effect, e-commerce company Etsy
[14:15.720 --> 14:24.280]  warned sellers of delay in payment because of Silicon Valley bank collapse, SVB bank
[14:24.280 --> 14:30.040]  crash in U.S., when interest rates were zero, banks loaded up on long dated, seemingly
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.760]  low risk treasuries, as the Fed raises interest rates to find inflation, the value of those
[14:34.760 --> 14:41.400]  assets is falling, leaving banks sitting on unrealized losses.
[14:41.400 --> 14:46.920]  As Silicon Valley bank face collapsed, lenders were pushing woke LGBT nonsense, it's not
[14:46.920 --> 14:52.840]  nonsense, it's depopulation agenda, we got a video of Trump saying if Biden was elected
[14:52.840 --> 14:59.640]  we see another 1929 bank crash, remember that?
[14:59.640 --> 15:05.440]  Dominoes are falling, is this the next terror, the unleashing of people, I worry, will we
[15:05.440 --> 15:11.120]  be told the next banking crisis will be a bail in, not a bail out, the depositors cash
[15:11.120 --> 15:16.000]  will be taken, that's what the FDIC and the European Central Bank have said in videos
[15:16.000 --> 15:21.480]  we desperately played over and over again in the last two months, remember that?
[15:21.480 --> 15:26.200]  In fact, get those queued up, the one with the Federal Reserve, there's the European
[15:26.200 --> 15:29.640]  Central Bank one, there's the FDIC one, there's three of them, I meant to play all three last
[15:29.640 --> 15:35.640]  night on the Sunday show, I think I only played one of them, but you always know what to invest
[15:35.640 --> 15:43.400]  in when Kramer tells you, plus Forbes owned by the Chicoms, Forbes listed SVB as the best
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.400]  investment you could make for 2023, because they knew they were about to dump it, so hey,
[15:48.400 --> 15:54.720]  get in there immediately, Forbes said, they love you, they're trendy, I'm getting through
[15:54.720 --> 15:57.720]  the stack here, I'll tell you where I think it's all going, we'll be right back, stay
[15:57.720 --> 16:00.640]  with us.
[16:00.640 --> 16:04.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World is a historic
[16:04.600 --> 16:08.840]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, planned for our future, that is
[16:08.840 --> 16:12.920]  a hellish future, now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting
[16:12.920 --> 16:16.840]  to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World
[16:16.840 --> 16:20.960]  at bookstores, amazon or infowarshore.com, but you will never be able to get another
[16:20.960 --> 16:26.200]  signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out, and there's about a thousand
[16:26.200 --> 16:30.760]  left of them right now, so get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[16:30.760 --> 16:35.880]  a signed copy at infowarshore.com, and there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser
[16:35.880 --> 16:40.120]  to keep us on the air, so you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[16:40.120 --> 16:43.760]  you'll also know that you help keep info wars on the air, I'm going to thank those of you
[16:43.760 --> 16:47.520]  that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies, but I want to encourage

[18:49.880 --> 18:54.440]  to go to infowarstore. These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they

[19:01.280 --> 19:05.800]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had. I don't think anybody can deny
[19:05.800 --> 19:11.680]  it and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew
[19:11.680 --> 19:17.160]  at info wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have
[19:17.160 --> 19:21.840]  been the MVPs in this fight. And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the
[19:21.840 --> 19:28.520]  hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[19:28.520 --> 19:32.760]  So for myself, the whole info wars crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage
[19:32.760 --> 19:38.160]  you now to realize that info wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you
[19:38.160 --> 19:41.920]  spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But most
[19:41.920 --> 19:46.720]  viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich
[19:46.720 --> 19:51.240]  and empower your life. All at the same time, keep us on air. I know that less than 1% of
[19:51.240 --> 19:55.680]  our listeners actually go buy products at infowarstore.com. If just 1% more of you took
[19:55.680 --> 19:59.840]  action and went to infowarstore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action
[19:59.840 --> 20:00.840]  now.
[20:00.840 --> 20:11.680]  This is a meeting of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[20:11.680 --> 20:16.280]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show special Monday edition. So we've told you these financial
[20:16.280 --> 20:23.680]  crises are coming. The analogy I use is Thanksgiving. I use it all the time. This is the best analogy.
[20:23.680 --> 20:26.440]  You have the big table with the adults and you have a little card table with the kids
[20:26.440 --> 20:31.680]  or card tables with the kids. And the kids are over here talking about kids stuff. The
[20:31.680 --> 20:34.720]  adults are talking about the adult stuff. When you look at the universities and you
[20:34.720 --> 20:42.200]  look at the federal boards and you watch these clips of the UN, they just admit, I remember
[20:42.200 --> 20:49.360]  in December of 2019, we made a big deal about it when it happened. They had a big UN meeting
[20:49.360 --> 20:52.400]  about the vaccines and they said the vaccines aren't working. They're killing people. This
[20:52.400 --> 20:56.080]  is before the cover shots. And doctors around the world have turned against us and what
[20:56.080 --> 21:00.200]  are we going to do? They release something bigger than poses a savior. And they just
[21:00.200 --> 21:04.800]  sit there talking about it like we're not watching. I have dozens of clips. I'll play
[21:04.800 --> 21:10.440]  just a few of them. Of the FDIC and the private federal reserve meeting in the last two months
[21:10.440 --> 21:15.920]  saying the bail ins are coming, the banking system is going under, the bubble is popping.
[21:15.920 --> 21:22.040]  Do we tell the public? And they say, no, we don't tell them. I mean, it's not like I
[21:22.040 --> 21:27.640]  predicted this. They said they were going to do it. They knew damn well when they started
[21:27.640 --> 21:33.680]  raising interest rates, when they had a strung out on all this free credit and money, that
[21:33.680 --> 21:38.960]  it was going to pop the real estate market. But first, it's going to be car loans and
[21:38.960 --> 21:42.880]  a bunch of the biggest companies are going belly up. They already have two of them the
[21:42.880 --> 21:47.760]  last month. The word is some of the biggest are going belly up this week because they
[21:47.760 --> 21:55.120]  have record, not even since the depression, record defaults on car loans. That's the canary
[21:55.120 --> 21:58.400]  in the coal mine. So I'm not up here trying to create fear. General Flynn came on Saturday
[21:58.400 --> 22:02.600]  by the great point. He said, but it's not panic because they want that. But you're damned
[22:02.600 --> 22:05.960]  if you do, you're damned if you don't. This audience needs to know what's going on. I
[22:05.960 --> 22:09.680]  don't know how long this is going to go on for, but they plan on bringing the system
[22:09.680 --> 22:14.120]  down. Their old system, their old Ponzi scheme is it's over and bringing in their new one
[22:14.120 --> 22:17.960]  that's a thousand times worse, the central bank digital currencies that will run every
[22:17.960 --> 22:23.560]  facet of our lives, destroy small businesses, track and control everything and surveil every
[22:23.560 --> 22:29.400]  move you make. I mean, it is so horrible. I can't even believe how horrible it is. So
[22:29.400 --> 22:32.680]  let's play a couple of these clips back to back. First the FDIC and then the Federal
[22:32.680 --> 22:33.680]  Reserve meeting.
[22:33.680 --> 22:38.800]  I mean, it's a little bit conflicted, right? I mean, it's important that people understand
[22:38.800 --> 22:43.560]  they can be nailed in, but you don't want a huge run on the institution. But they have,
[22:43.560 --> 22:50.840]  I mean, they're going to be. And it could be an early warning signal to the FDIC and
[22:50.840 --> 22:57.760]  the primary regulators when these things happen. And there may be some other prices, similar
[22:57.760 --> 23:05.800]  to what Jay was saying, in the market that you can tell whether people understand who's
[23:05.800 --> 23:11.280]  going to be protected, who isn't going to be protected. It would be, I think, an interesting
[23:11.280 --> 23:18.520]  study to look at the evolution of market prices in a situation like March of 2020, for example,
[23:18.520 --> 23:20.920]  and see whether people understood what might happen.
[23:20.920 --> 23:26.240]  Should be accessible when people need to know. But I don't think you have much hope of reaching
[23:26.240 --> 23:32.880]  a public that doesn't have a professional need to know.
[23:32.880 --> 23:37.720]  I completely agree with that. I almost think you'd scare the public. If you put this out,
[23:37.720 --> 23:43.480]  like, why are they telling me this? Should I be concerned about my bank? Like, my insurance
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.080]  company doesn't tell me what they're doing with my assets if they just assume they're
[23:48.080 --> 23:54.320]  going to pay my claim, right? I think you've got to think of the unintended consequences
[23:54.320 --> 23:59.520]  of taking a public that has more full faith and confidence in the banking system than
[23:59.520 --> 24:04.680]  maybe people in this room do, that we want them to have full faith and confidence in
[24:04.680 --> 24:08.200]  the banking system. They know the FDIC insurance is there. They know it works. They put their
[24:08.200 --> 24:10.400]  money and they're going to get their money out.
[24:10.400 --> 24:16.560]  So there is a select crowd of people that are in the institutional side. And if they
[24:16.560 --> 24:19.320]  want to understand this, they're going to find a way to understand this. There's a
[24:19.320 --> 24:22.080]  bunch of law firms representing this room. There's a bunch of people that charge them
[24:22.080 --> 24:27.440]  by the hour. A lot of money to explain this all to them. And it's fine. I don't have
[24:27.440 --> 24:32.280]  a problem with that. And they all have huge staffs. But I would be careful about the unintended
[24:32.280 --> 24:36.760]  consequences of starting to blast too much of this out in the general public.
[24:36.760 --> 24:40.800]  Okay. So you noticed on Wednesday last week, I made a big deal about it, started the show
[24:40.800 --> 24:44.760]  with it. Biden put out his new big national directive. The last one was two years ago
[24:44.760 --> 24:49.640]  saying the American people are the enemy. They are the terrorist. The next segment, I'm
[24:49.640 --> 24:54.840]  going to play a video on Australia, put out on national news. The government's new military
[24:54.840 --> 25:01.520]  recruiting plan is be part of attacking citizens with police dogs and putting them in camps.
[25:01.520 --> 25:07.160]  You're like, why would you do that? Because they've got to go tell the regional Federal
[25:07.160 --> 25:11.760]  Reserve boards. There's 12 of them. And they've got to tell the FDIC board. That's the big
[25:11.760 --> 25:15.760]  central banks above this. This is coming. So they've been sitting around in these meetings
[25:15.760 --> 25:19.720]  for months saying, well, what do we do during the collapse? I mean, do we tell them it's
[25:19.720 --> 25:24.480]  coming so we have credibility or do we just sucker punch them? And the answer is they
[25:24.480 --> 25:30.000]  sucker punch you. So they tell you everything's fine. All your deposits are taken care of.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.440]  Everything's okay. And you think, oh, well, they tried to stop what's happening. Meanwhile,
[25:33.440 --> 25:37.120]  they're engineering the whole damn thing. And clearly that's what they're doing. Do
[25:37.120 --> 25:40.240]  I know exactly what they're going to pull, how they're going to pull it, when they're
[25:40.240 --> 25:44.320]  going to pull it? No, like I always say, I've looked over their shoulder. I know what cards
[25:44.320 --> 25:49.480]  they've got in their hand. I don't know how they're going to play those cards. This is
[25:49.480 --> 25:54.200]  a poker game, but they're going to play the damn cards. And so we're now down to the wire
[25:54.200 --> 26:01.360]  here on this. And the bottom line is this is a bail in. Because when you say we're going
[26:01.360 --> 26:07.600]  to protect all the deposits and the investors in these banks, then you're saying it's a
[26:07.600 --> 26:11.680]  bail in and you're signaling that and there isn't enough money even in the fiat system
[26:11.680 --> 26:17.800]  to pay it. So this brings down the monetary system worldwide. But don't worry, they've
[26:17.800 --> 26:23.720]  got it all fired up and all ready with Biden's plan that we know there was run by Bill Gates
[26:23.720 --> 26:28.360]  through the IMF and World Bank and through the UN where they've already standardized
[26:28.360 --> 26:35.920]  the SDRs. They've already standardized all of the new social credit score systems. They
[26:35.920 --> 26:42.960]  already standardized the central bank digital currencies. And now, right on time, I mean,
[26:42.960 --> 26:47.240]  I've been up here every day for two months saying I believe the banking crisis, the financial
[26:47.240 --> 26:51.480]  crisis is imminent. I believe it's imminent. Why? Because I watch all these regulatory
[26:51.480 --> 26:55.120]  meetings and they're like talking about it like it's a foregone conclusion. It's like
[26:55.120 --> 26:59.920]  doctors may learn you have cancer all over your body. Well, do we tell the patient they'll
[26:59.920 --> 27:05.560]  be dead in three months for sure? Maybe a month? Well, yeah, they tell you. But see, that's
[27:05.560 --> 27:09.960]  grandma and we know grandma was old and it's sad, but she's going to die. What do they
[27:09.960 --> 27:15.160]  do when they tell you we've got cancer financially all of us? They don't want you to know that
[27:15.160 --> 27:21.760]  because they want to preposition themselves to get their money out so they can be in charge
[27:21.760 --> 27:26.240]  when everything is devalued and they consolidate power. And that's what they do with these
[27:26.240 --> 27:31.400]  financial crises. They engineer every one of these. And you know why they do it? They
[27:31.400 --> 27:35.520]  know if they don't engineer it, it'll happen naturally because of the out of control nature
[27:35.520 --> 27:41.520]  of it. So they have control demolitions, just like Redidare invented over 100 years ago
[27:41.520 --> 27:46.120]  with a wheelbarrow dynamite going into an oil well that was on fire and the explosion
[27:46.120 --> 27:51.560]  would be so big he discovered how to put in oil. Oil fires used to burn for years sometimes.
[27:51.560 --> 27:58.400]  They got some oil fires in Russia, natural gas fires that have been burning for 50 years.
[27:58.400 --> 28:02.400]  They're still oil fires and gas fires they can't put out. Well, Redidare learned how
[28:02.400 --> 28:06.800]  to get rid of most of them with a big old thing of TNT. They give a bonus to whoever
[28:06.800 --> 28:12.040]  would run in there with it on a wheelbarrow and sit in it and haul ass for their life.
[28:12.040 --> 28:16.720]  Redidare's company made billions of dollars doing that. Well, that's what they do. But
[28:16.720 --> 28:22.360]  see, they ran the whole show. They're not just fixing a crisis. They engineer the crises,
[28:22.360 --> 28:27.800]  they ride up to the top in the stock market, and then they go back down to the bottom of
[28:27.800 --> 28:32.600]  their preposition, and they consolidate power. And what's happened the last 60 years? Vertical
[28:32.600 --> 28:37.880]  integration. 1955, the U.S. had half the wealth in the world and it was distributed to the
[28:37.880 --> 28:40.880]  biggest middle class the planet ever saw. The American middle class was bigger than
[28:40.880 --> 28:46.120]  all of the middle classes in the world combined. We're only 4% of the population. Now, 80 plus
[28:46.120 --> 28:51.440]  percent of the wealth is in the hands of one tenth of one percent, and soon it'll be 90%.
[28:51.440 --> 29:00.760]  But it's all liberal and trendy, so it's fun. And it's got transgenderism. It's cool.
[29:00.760 --> 29:06.560]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWarsTour.com
[29:06.560 --> 29:10.320]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system

[30:57.280 --> 30:59.880]  to enrich your life and keep us on air at InfoWarsTour.com.
[30:59.880 --> 31:05.480]  I've got some good news. Our high-quality supplements really work and we have about
[31:05.480 --> 31:11.320]  an 80% reorder rate with customers. That's the good news. They're amazing. The bad news
[31:11.320 --> 31:17.000]  is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to InfoWarsTour.com
[31:17.000 --> 31:21.280]  and ever actually buy the products. So you're missing out on these products plus it funds
[31:21.280 --> 31:26.520]  the InfoWars. Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying
[31:26.520 --> 31:32.920]  products. Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to InfoWarsTour.com
[31:32.920 --> 31:37.480]  and got some of these amazing products. I would recommend Turmeric 95 for your joints,
[31:37.480 --> 31:41.480]  your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects so you reorder it and see
[31:41.480 --> 31:47.160]  how great it is. Also, we've got the super high-quality full-spectrum CBD oil that's
[31:47.160 --> 31:51.640]  so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well. Or

[31:56.640 --> 32:02.000]  together. InfoWarsTour.com.
[32:02.000 --> 32:07.960]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane
[32:07.960 --> 32:12.520]  place. World War III has already started. Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[32:12.520 --> 32:16.280]  There's mass censorship. James O'Keefe been removed from Project Veritas. The list goes
[32:16.280 --> 32:19.480]  on and on of the bad things that are happening. But the good things that are happening is
[32:19.480 --> 32:24.960]  humanity is really accelerating its way. But those of us on the forefront are under more
[32:24.960 --> 32:29.040]  attack by the establishment than ever. That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word
[32:29.040 --> 32:33.120]  about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the air by getting
[32:33.120 --> 32:37.080]  great products at InfoWarsTour.com. And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all
[32:37.080 --> 32:40.840]  sold out, or the great reset in the world, or ultimate bone broth, finally back in stock
[32:40.840 --> 32:44.840]  after over two years, it's all available at InfoWarsTour.com. These are truly amazing
[32:44.840 --> 32:49.760]  products. So, get your InfoWars products at InfoWarsTour.com and enrich your life while
[32:49.760 --> 32:54.320]  keeping the broadcast on the air. It is your decision on whether or not we stay on air,
[32:54.320 --> 33:22.800]  so please take action now at InfoWarsTour.
[33:24.320 --> 33:53.800]  Isn't it rich? Isn't it queer? Isn't it queer? Losing my timing this late in my career.
[33:53.800 --> 34:01.000]  People are just like Sam Bankman-Freed. They're just bigger fish, so they think they're too
[34:01.000 --> 34:09.560]  big to fail, too big to go to prison, too big to ever be held to account. But we are holding
[34:09.560 --> 34:14.360]  to account every front. Their whole system is falling apart in front of us, and it's
[34:14.360 --> 34:18.960]  the InfoWars that's going to be aware of their operations and how to stop them. People like
[34:18.960 --> 34:24.040]  Kramer and people like Forbes go out and tell you invest in something right before it goes
[34:24.040 --> 34:35.560]  under. I'm not perfect, but in 2012, 2013, when gold started to go down, I said, J.P.
[34:35.560 --> 34:40.200]  Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and others internationally are naked shorting it, gold and silver. I've
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.720]  been telling you about gold and silver at that time for 15 years. I said, get out of
[34:44.720 --> 34:51.440]  it. A lot of people got mad at me saying, you're killing the market. I said, no, they're
[34:51.440 --> 34:54.000]  going to bring it down. You should get out of it. Now, I've been telling you the last
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.160]  few years, get back into it. You see where it's at. I think the next time, they're not
[34:58.160 --> 35:03.520]  going to be able to stop it going up. I go up 10,000 percent, both metals. I just go
[35:03.520 --> 35:08.760]  with the best information I have. Sometimes I make mistakes, but never on purpose. These
[35:08.760 --> 35:13.600]  people lie to you by design. Here is Jim Kramer a few weeks ago.
[35:13.600 --> 35:19.240]  Here is professional BS artist slash dumb person, Jim Kramer of CNBC telling his viewers
[35:19.240 --> 35:25.600]  to buy Silicon Valley Bank, even as it was in the process of going under. This is last
[35:25.600 --> 35:27.000]  month.
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.560]  SVB Financial, don't you want? This company's a merchant bank with a deposit base that Wall
[35:31.560 --> 35:35.800]  Street had been mistakenly concerned about. SVB and Silicon Valley Bank recently bought
[35:35.800 --> 35:39.080]  one of our favorite research firms, Boffat Native Inc., and it's become less dependent
[35:39.080 --> 35:42.880]  on private equity and venture capitalist offerings. Wait a second. Those trying to play
[35:42.880 --> 35:46.000]  a trick, they could come back. Long-term private equity and venture capital, they're not going
[35:46.000 --> 35:52.640]  away. Being a banker to these immense pools of capital has always been a very good business.
[35:52.640 --> 35:57.960]  SVB's nearly 40 percent rally this year is barely a drop in the bucket.
[35:57.960 --> 36:05.800]  SVB is great. If that guy ever endorses anything you're doing, move to the Canary Islands.
[36:05.800 --> 36:11.400]  Change your name because disaster is coming.
[36:11.400 --> 36:22.160]  There ain't coming. It's here. So, there are reports of bank runs all over the world.
[36:22.160 --> 36:28.480]  They want a crisis. They want to destroy the existing system. I don't think the timing's
[36:28.480 --> 36:31.600]  right for them to do it right now, but things got out of control. These people aren't all
[36:31.600 --> 36:36.400]  powerful. They want their central bank digital currencies. They're getting them all set up.
[36:36.400 --> 36:41.840]  They're almost ready, but they're not ready yet in most areas. They're just now getting
[36:41.840 --> 36:45.400]  it all standardized. I've got articles right here.
[36:45.400 --> 36:52.000]  This is definitely an attack on crypto as well. A lot of big crypto banks are going
[36:52.000 --> 37:02.720]  under right now. This is a you-know-what show, SH-T show, a big one. But I do know the people
[37:02.720 --> 37:08.280]  running the system make sure we get left holding the bag and they run off with all the power
[37:08.280 --> 37:15.520]  and the money. So, if we let them do it, they are the clowns. Here's a CNN piece actually
[37:15.520 --> 37:24.560]  telling the truth. It's not 300 billion. It's 620 billion, and that was as of this morning
[37:24.560 --> 37:29.560]  that the FDIC's already saying they're going to pay for it. It's already spent 300 plus
[37:29.560 --> 37:34.840]  billion. This is a bail-in, but I noticed there was a viral clip on Twitter. It's got
[37:34.840 --> 37:41.000]  like 600,000 views as of this morning when I saw it. Myself on Saturday for the emergency
[37:41.000 --> 37:47.440]  broadcast with General Flynn, and I say, this is going to be a huge bail-in, and they're
[37:47.440 --> 37:53.200]  going to push central bank digital currencies out of this. And then the comments, almost
[37:53.200 --> 38:01.040]  all of them under it are like, Jones is wrong again. Yellen and Biden say no bail-outs.
[38:01.040 --> 38:10.960]  How is it not a bail-out when they're guaranteeing the deposits above $250,000? How is that not
[38:10.960 --> 38:17.320]  a bail-out if people weren't smart enough to keep it below that? All I'm saying is the
[38:17.320 --> 38:24.320]  public just really likes to get hurt. Let's continue. This is what I was just talking
[38:24.320 --> 38:29.840]  about. Swift, one of the biggest international banking clearinghouses that works with thousands
[38:29.840 --> 38:41.120]  of banks and systems, to conduct more tests with CBDC project, the Banking Network is seeking
[38:41.120 --> 38:46.200]  to build a system that will connect the digital currencies of different countries, and they
[38:46.200 --> 38:51.880]  want to have it ready within a month, be able to operate with hundreds of different CBDCs
[38:51.880 --> 39:01.160]  even when other global currencies fail. See what I'm talking about? Oh no, more Silicon
[39:01.160 --> 39:10.280]  Valley bank fallout, Goldman Sachs backed Circle Stablecoin, USDC no longer pegged to
[39:10.280 --> 39:20.400]  the dollar, conversion to dollars halted, and that's backed by some of the largest globalist
[39:20.400 --> 39:29.640]  banks in the world like JP Morgan and others. Oh nothing to see here, just move along. Silicon
[39:29.640 --> 39:37.680]  Valley bank imploded in a single day, it could be just the tip of the iceberg, Yahoo News.
[39:37.680 --> 39:41.360]  So they tell you, officially everything's fine, but then they still try to hype the
[39:41.360 --> 39:46.160]  fear. So this is quite a tight rope to walk here. The government has 48 hours, billionaire
[39:46.160 --> 39:51.040]  investor Bill Ackerman calls on Biden to bail out, SVB on Monday morning, or face catastrophic
[39:51.040 --> 39:55.440]  market meltdown and loss of tens of thousands of jobs, and they did do the bailout but it's
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.960]  not being called a bailout. Silicon Valley bank employees receive bonuses hours before
[40:00.960 --> 40:08.000]  government takeover, CNBC. SVB fallout spreads around the world from London to Singapore,
[40:08.000 --> 40:14.560]  Yahoo News. British tech sector at serious risk and SVB collapse, government. Contagion
[40:14.560 --> 40:17.720]  spread just because customers line up outside of First Republic Bank to take their money
[40:17.720 --> 40:23.560]  out after SVB bank collapse and shock waves through the market. The Silicon Valley bank
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.520]  crisis will force the Fed to slash rates 100 basis points for event contagion, market
[40:27.520 --> 40:36.040]  guru says. I agree with that. Banking before the collapse Silicon Valley bank, SIVB, the
[40:36.040 --> 40:45.280]  CEO sold 3.57 million stocks within the last two weeks. Two year treasury yields plunge
[40:45.280 --> 40:52.720]  most since black Monday, gold sores as rate height, odds collapse. Future's tumble yields
[40:52.720 --> 40:58.360]  crater, banks plunge as market realizes latest bailout is insufficient. I want to say something
[40:58.360 --> 41:04.760]  about gold. Yeah, they've got gold where it's at, they're artificially suppressing
[41:04.760 --> 41:09.000]  up and it's still going up, same thing with silver, but when you actually try to go out,
[41:09.000 --> 41:14.360]  I talk to a lot of folks, I've gone and seen for myself, and try to find gold. Oh, sorry,
[41:14.360 --> 41:19.360]  we don't have gold at melt or 1% above, we got it at 10, 20% above, and then people try
[41:19.360 --> 41:23.960]  to buy it at that and they go, well, you want to buy that much? Sorry, we don't have it.
[41:23.960 --> 41:31.720]  Oh, sorry, you want to mint some silver coins? We don't have it. So you have all the fiat
[41:31.720 --> 41:35.640]  currency in the rig markets and the naked shorting to keep the old silver down, but
[41:35.640 --> 41:39.280]  it's still way up, but they're holding down the beach ball under the water, but then you
[41:39.280 --> 41:46.040]  can't find it because in reality, it's worth way more. That's like price fixing in the
[41:46.040 --> 41:50.680]  market in the Soviet Union or something where they say, oh, well, sausage and bread and this
[41:50.680 --> 41:54.600]  is all at this price and milk is this price, but at that price, you can't produce it.
[41:54.600 --> 42:01.880]  So it doesn't exist. But that's called how the real market works, not cuckoo land. Yellen,
[42:01.880 --> 42:08.480]  no federal bailout for collapsed Silicon Valley Bank. Really, what are you doing? And it goes
[42:08.480 --> 42:12.760]  on and on. Forbes listed Silicon Valley Bank as one of the America's best banks just weeks
[42:12.760 --> 42:19.000]  before collapse. Fatal distraction, senior SVB bank risk manager, oversaw LGBT programs.
[42:19.000 --> 42:25.720]  Well, yeah, we distract with all this BS while they rape your ass. And it goes on and on and
[42:25.720 --> 42:29.760]  on. I got a lot more to hit on that. We'll come back and get into it. I'm going to shift
[42:29.760 --> 42:33.880]  gears and all the other subjects and we've got a bunch of big guests today. I'll tell
[42:33.880 --> 42:37.280]  you about them coming up here a little bit later, but I want to just ask listeners a
[42:37.280 --> 42:40.720]  very important question when we return the other side of this break because you got a
[42:40.720 --> 42:46.440]  decision to make and so do I. But here's the good news and the bad news. Everybody's going
[42:46.440 --> 42:51.280]  to have to face reality and face God and face the consequences of all our actions. That's
[42:51.280 --> 42:56.600]  how the universe works, including the globalist, but including you and I. So think about that.
[42:56.600 --> 43:01.240]  We'll be right back.
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.040]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to info or store.com
[43:07.040 --> 43:10.840]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system
[43:10.840 --> 43:16.760]  and your body and keep us on air. I am humbly had in hand talking to the viewers and listeners
[43:16.760 --> 43:21.960]  that have tuned in many of you for years and never gone to info or store.com. We know the
[43:21.960 --> 43:27.360]  vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you never actually go to info or store.com and never
[43:27.360 --> 43:31.240]  experience these great products and never find the operation. Sure, you share a link,
[43:31.240 --> 43:34.920]  you share an article, you tell folks about the show. That's great. I thank you. But we
[43:34.920 --> 43:38.920]  need funds to operate. Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for
[43:38.920 --> 43:43.640]  people like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our sweet bait and our nitric oxide and
[43:43.640 --> 43:47.480]  our real red pill. Plus, all of these are really great products that keep us on air.
[43:47.480 --> 43:51.640]  Plus, you're missing out on these products. So get off the bench, get in the game, step
[43:51.640 --> 43:57.160]  to the plate and go to info or store.com right now and get these great info or products
[43:57.160 --> 43:58.160]  at info or store.com.
[43:58.160 --> 44:07.840]  Info wars, tomorrow's news today. This is their big move. So yeah, you say, why doesn't
[44:07.840 --> 44:13.320]  Biden address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job.
[44:13.320 --> 44:19.360]  He's not the president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[44:19.360 --> 44:25.880]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. And that's who we are.
[44:25.880 --> 44:33.840]  That's only to understand one word. No, no, no. Exactly. And that's why we say no to
[44:33.840 --> 44:40.440]  your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our businesses. We say no to you taking our
[44:40.440 --> 44:45.920]  firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say no to you selling us out to
[44:45.920 --> 44:50.200]  the World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into World War three. You're
[44:50.200 --> 44:56.400]  right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden. And we say no. And we say no to
[44:56.400 --> 45:07.560]  your war. Info wars, tomorrow's news today. This is their big move. So yeah, you say,
[45:07.560 --> 45:12.120]  why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States? He doesn't care. That's
[45:12.120 --> 45:16.840]  not his job. He's not the president of the United States. He's a puppet operating for
[45:16.840 --> 45:25.280]  the globalist. Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed. And that's
[45:25.280 --> 45:32.560]  who we are. Autocrats only understand one word. No, no, no. Exactly. And that's why
[45:32.560 --> 45:39.720]  we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our businesses. We say no to
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.840]  you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say no to you
[45:44.840 --> 45:49.440]  selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into World War
[45:49.440 --> 45:55.560]  three. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden. And we say no. And we
[45:55.560 --> 46:04.440]  say no to your war. Ladies and gentlemen, info wars has proven itself the last 28 years
[46:04.440 --> 46:08.000]  to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those
[46:08.000 --> 46:12.920]  times. And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners support while selling you great
[46:12.920 --> 46:16.880]  products at the same time. So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners of support to
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.520]  some of the years by spreading the word, praying for the broadcast and buying product. But I
[46:21.520 --> 46:24.760]  really want to encourage those of you that have been on the fence and never actually
[46:24.760 --> 46:30.920]  gone to info wars.com to go there and get the great books and films and supplements

[47:01.960 --> 47:21.400]  assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[47:21.400 --> 47:46.680]  You figured it out folks. This isn't a game. I'm not playing around. We're at war with
[47:46.680 --> 47:53.920]  the new world order. They know I'm at war with them. They know it's an info or the whole
[47:53.920 --> 48:01.280]  world with everything Alex Jones talked about now and everybody's paying attention. I know
[48:01.280 --> 48:07.080]  how to beat them. I've lived my whole life for the moment we're now in and so have you
[48:07.080 --> 48:15.960]  and we're going to win. We have to admit the facts. We have to admit that the globalists
[48:15.960 --> 48:24.920]  are out to get us. We got to knock their ideas dead. Knock them dead. We got to knock them
[48:24.920 --> 48:32.200]  dead because these people will take everything you've got and everything you'll ever have
[48:32.200 --> 48:42.360]  including all your freedoms and your soul to the scum of the earth.
[48:42.360 --> 48:49.960]  All right. Let me talk about the big decision everybody's got to make. There is no doubt
[48:49.960 --> 48:54.120]  info wars is doing the most important work we've ever done in 20 almost nine years on
[48:54.120 --> 49:02.280]  air and I thank you for your support and I appreciate you but I'm really concerned.
[49:02.280 --> 49:08.480]  I can either go 100% in this fight but it's so consuming and so exhausting that if you
[49:08.480 --> 49:13.600]  don't go 100% in a football game or anything else in life it's too hard. You got to go
[49:13.600 --> 49:19.680]  all the way and then it's easy. I got to fight or anything else or clean your house or plow
[49:19.680 --> 49:26.240]  in a field. Got to get into it and get it done and like it or it's hell. You got my
[49:26.240 --> 49:31.000]  commitment. Never give up but that means I've got to be honest with you because if I don't
[49:31.000 --> 49:37.480]  explain things to you that's a form of giving up a soft quitting and I've caught myself
[49:37.480 --> 49:41.440]  in the last three or four months doing that a little bit just because things are so overwhelming.
[49:41.440 --> 49:45.840]  We've been vindicated and then I kind of go okay I've done my part folks. I have this
[49:45.840 --> 49:50.480]  big burning responsibility. I know we've changed the world together and then God says no you've
[49:50.480 --> 49:59.600]  just begun your mission. Stop convincing yourself to go easy because you'll be in a position
[49:59.600 --> 50:04.280]  later wishing you'd done more and I know you're in the same place. So listen to me please
[50:04.280 --> 50:11.080]  and let it sink in hard. The most important thing you can do is get right with God and
[50:11.080 --> 50:19.360]  then get right with your family and then support broadcast and institutions and organizations
[50:19.360 --> 50:25.680]  that want to have a good future because I have a life force. I have instincts. I have
[50:25.680 --> 50:30.360]  a survival instinct. It's not heroic to fight the globalists. They're coming after us. It's
[50:30.360 --> 50:37.200]  not heroic. It's not oh amazing. We have to get past that type of thinking. That's bad
[50:37.200 --> 50:43.400]  thinking folks. This is not heroic what I'm doing. I'm not joining with these psychotics,
[50:43.400 --> 50:49.000]  these devil worshipers, these losers but if you don't fight them it's the same thing as
[50:49.000 --> 50:53.240]  joining them. In fact if you're going to go on with evil might as well join the club and
[50:53.240 --> 50:57.120]  you know just party as much as you can before you die and you know God gets ahold of your
[50:57.120 --> 51:03.960]  soul. So it's very simple. We have products you need. I do not need to be spending five
[51:03.960 --> 51:10.480]  hours a day trying to raise money. I need to be on air cutting special reports, funding
[51:10.480 --> 51:18.520]  operations, kicking new world order but. So it's very simple. You better decide what your
[51:18.520 --> 51:25.200]  priorities are and look I'm not a big fancy pants guy but in the past I bought an eight
[51:25.200 --> 51:30.520]  hundred dollar pair of cowboy boots and that's not a bad thing. I wanted them they were you
[51:30.520 --> 51:39.840]  know crocodile or whatever in black and look great but I bought those 10 years ago. I would
[51:39.840 --> 51:45.200]  not buy a pair of cowboy boots today. It's not bad. It funds the economy. It's wonderful.
[51:45.200 --> 51:48.360]  You know made right here in Texas. I'm not mad about it's got eight hundred dollar pair
[51:48.360 --> 51:55.720]  of cowboy boots. What I'm saying is in this world we're in and the priorities that are
[51:55.720 --> 52:00.200]  out there if I have wealth that should all be put towards the fight against the globalist.
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.640]  It doesn't mean I don't get a stake sometimes or like to drive a car that you know runs
[52:04.640 --> 52:10.080]  well. But at the end of the day the days of luxury the days of it's almost like an idle
[52:10.080 --> 52:15.560]  even care about something other than flesh and blood in our hearts and our souls. So
[52:15.560 --> 52:20.760]  I'm telling you you might want to cut that Vegas trip out. You might want to cut out
[52:20.760 --> 52:25.560]  all the little sad crap or go into the fancy restaurant because even if you're middle
[52:25.560 --> 52:32.080]  class in the days that are coming you're not going to be the parties over and I'm really
[52:32.080 --> 52:40.480]  concerned in the priority realm that info wars is barely paying the bills and successfully
[52:40.480 --> 52:46.520]  navigating a chapter 11 sub chapter five reorganization that if we can just reorganize and follow
[52:46.520 --> 52:51.960]  through they'll either settle with us for a reasonable amount so we can operate the future
[52:51.960 --> 52:56.920]  or we fight two three years of appeals and three years from now is like a million years
[52:56.920 --> 53:02.240]  from now and what's going to happen. So we are solvent we are operating we are there
[53:02.240 --> 53:07.680]  the only people that can decide to take us off air are you and we have incredible products
[53:07.680 --> 53:14.320]  you need I mean you need our open bone broth you need our prebiotic you need to get the
[53:14.320 --> 53:18.360]  great turmeric toothpaste these are great products you need to get basil beach you
[53:18.360 --> 53:22.680]  need to get fizzy magnesium you need to get our amazing CBD oil that's the highest grade
[53:22.680 --> 53:27.920]  out there for more than half off what they sell it for at clinics and things you need
[53:27.920 --> 53:32.160]  these products these will enrich your life and they keep us on air so I'm just asking
[53:32.160 --> 53:37.720]  you to make the commitment so I can spend time covering news and so I can spend time
[53:37.720 --> 53:42.560]  fighting the globalists and not spend time plugging on air and bringing on a bunch of
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.960]  sponsors and stuff that I don't want to do you know they're great sponsors I want less
[53:46.960 --> 53:53.360]  ads not more so just commit to go to infowarstore.com just make the decision because you're going
[53:53.360 --> 53:58.920]  to have to decide what your priorities are so am I in this world you're going to have
[53:58.920 --> 54:05.360]  to decide what is of value to you and I know you're I'm stating a very obvious point you're
[54:05.360 --> 54:12.320]  like next you're going to tell me again that the sky is blue exactly what are your priorities
[54:12.320 --> 54:18.600]  because the whole new world order system will succeed and all it's evil if shows like mine

[55:51.600 --> 55:56.120]  case that is so criminal in my view where the judge said no they're allowed to hold back
[55:56.120 --> 56:00.080]  evidence destroy evidence and provocateur and cover it all up and give secret documents
[56:00.080 --> 56:04.640]  over on accident and basically they've been given a license to kill steal and destroy
[56:04.640 --> 56:11.920]  by their father you know that is the old old old serpent old scratch and the red pajamas

[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:44.080]  because i'm alive
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:53.680]  come on baby gotta set me free because i'm your live wire i don't want to air great
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:01.680]  reasons report from january where we predicted all of us and then i'll tell you where i think
[01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.800]  it's going and how we can mitigate it and deal with it but all three of great reasons reports
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.680]  are incredibly important i'm having reposts into the live show feed today so you can share them
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:23.680]  and warn people about how this is premeditated all right let's go ahead and go to that report
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:33.840]  canadian veteran and political activist jeremy mckenzie known as the raging dissident was
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:39.200]  just notified that he can no longer do banking in canada as part of ending the relationship
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:44.880]  to us is today um you're not to visit any of the kosher bank branches their bank premises
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:50.800]  in person with their first getting uh written consent in advance from the bank from management so
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:57.920]  i'm banned from the bank but it doesn't matter if you are a political activist or an obedient sheep
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:03.520]  because the banks are planning on taking all of your money to pay off their debts i mean it's a
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:08.880]  little bit conflicted right i mean it's important that people understand they can be bailed in
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.240]  but you don't want a huge run on the institution but they have i mean they're going to be that's
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:22.560]  the fdic currently has less than 200 billion dollars in assets to ensure over nine trillion
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:29.360]  that's just 1.3 percent they know that a system collapse is coming and they are already planning
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:36.640]  for bail ins as trust begins to fail the people will begin to withdraw their funds which will only
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:45.120]  guarantee a banking collapse this is known as a bank run in 2012 the international monetary fund
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:52.000]  known for their reputation of coercion violence and extortion published staff discussion notes
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:59.840]  entitled from bailout to bail in mandatory debt restructuring of systemic financial institutions
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:07.360]  after the 2008 crisis the world learned what a bailout is trillions of taxpayer dollars printed
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:14.880]  out of thin air to pay off the bankers bad habits it was hugely unpopular but pales in comparison
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:22.640]  to a bail in so what exactly is a bail in it is officially obfuscated with elaborate equations
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:28.800]  but to put it simply it is when the bank steals your money directly from your account they called
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:36.080]  they called it haircuts when they did it in cyprus back in 2013 which the courts later ruled was
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:43.440]  legit and a recent video on tiktok shows that the new bail ins may have already begun so i'm a
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:48.880]  bank of america and everybody's missing money i'm also missing money over $1,300 and they're telling
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.920]  me to call customer service and they keep hanging up on people there's another plus in here he's
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:04:00.000]  also missing money so we're trying to see what's going on money's missing today and we need our
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.160]  money and they're telling us to call customer service and customer furthest some service ain't
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.560]  doing nothing about it so just to head top is anybody's experiencing this please let us know
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.200]  because this is not right i'm missing $1,400 from my account and they're telling me that
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:18.000]  there is no way they can help us this guy's missing money too this other person missing money too
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.320]  and he's like you miss the money too there you go so this is not something that's just one person
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:28.160]  this is everybody's happening to them and this is crazy this is very crazy yes bank of america
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:32.160]  just started to take people's money without their consent and we're asking what's going on and they

[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:47.520]  host alex emrick jones from deep in the heart of texas broadcasting worldwide well the public
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:54.160]  president's words did not lend any confidence to the markets as bank runs accelerate around the
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:59.200]  planet latest developments in a moment but first some from the pedophile chi-com agent
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:06.880]  americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe we must get the full accounting
[01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:13.760]  of what happened and why those responsible can be held accountable let's also take a look at a moment
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:19.200]  to put the situation in a broader context we've made strong economic progress in the past two years
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:24.240]  take home pay for workers is going up especially for lower and middle-income workers
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:28.640]  president what do you know right now about why this happened and can you assure americans that
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.520]  there won't be a ripple effect do you expect other banks to fail mr president should all
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:42.000]  depositors be protected at all banks all right thank you i shouldn't laugh it's laughing at myself
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.080]  laughing at the gallows here here's some of the latest articles on info wars dot com
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:54.720]  trump warren's of new great depression silicon valley bank crisis liquidity crunch
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:59.840]  we have predicted has now begun yeah raising the interest rates everything got a strung out
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:08.000]  on all the easy credit it is going down so what do we do if they don't bail out all these banks
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.360]  regional banks going under it'll accelerate to a total banking collapse so it's a gun to our head
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:19.520]  it's like then treasury secretary back at the time of 2008 famously said what do you want tanks
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.200]  driving around the streets but then even when they bail these out in the next few months in
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:30.800]  the next year or so because they're not totally ready for the central bank digital currencies
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:35.760]  yet not ready to get rid of the old system yet this is the process of that they're going to run
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:41.200]  out of money out of the treasury and the answer will be this whole new monetary system that they're
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:46.720]  getting the final touches done on they've built the foundation built the superstructure built the
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:52.240]  surrounding areas put the windows in the doors in they wired the electricity and now they're doing
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:58.400]  a few final touches on this tyranny and then it will be rolled out against us as you've all witnessed
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:06.400]  as we predicted so what do we do well we've been manipulated since 1913 here in the us and
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:12.720]  similarly around the world under this private bank cartel so we identify the private bank cartel
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:18.880]  like ron paul did in so many hearings and warned about for so long and we politically form a movement
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.280]  to say we're not doing central bank digital currencies a solution we're not doing universal
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.600]  basic incomes when half the public doesn't have jobs like they're doing in italy and spain right now
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:33.040]  and and we don't accept troops on the streets and we don't accept see defund the police collapse
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:38.720]  society put troops on the streets brings society down build back better destroy civilization
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.720]  with the great reset and then build back better on its assets we oppose the jenna 2030 we oppose the
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:51.200]  jenna 21 we oppose the transgender pedophile time we oppose the fentanyl we oppose the open
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:57.280]  borders we oppose every new order policy and we point out they are the ones that orchestrated this
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.280]  that's why they're saying oh we're bailing it out oh we're against it oh we're gonna find those
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:09.200]  responsible and we're gonna put them in jail no arrest some mid-level bank people as all these
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:15.520]  regional banks that actually still lend money the public go under we should talk about the ecosystem
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:21.360]  and the whole structure of what allowed this to happen it's an information war we have farmland
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:25.040]  we have infrastructure we have everything we need we have all the energy we need
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:32.080]  but we have to end the globalist policies of high taxation regulation and massive commitments
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:38.480]  overseas and spending and the 200 billion i'm so sick of hearing people with old numbers of 100
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:47.120]  billion 129 billion 150 billion it was 200 billion dollars a month ago that we know about 200 billion
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:56.720]  dollars and that's real infrastructure we're paying to not have to go blow stuff up in ukraine
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:02.800]  in a slavic shibble war that i have no part of almost none of you do nothing against the russian
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.720]  nothing against the ukrainians but you guys want to kill each other knock yourselves out i'm not part
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:12.400]  of this i'm not part of all this lunatic asylum garbage i'm not part of all these other groups
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:18.320]  that are the kkk and the mexican mafia and the freaking black supremacist and all of it i mean
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:24.960]  it's just all a bunch of morons we have unlimited resources and capacity if we work hard if we study
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:30.000]  and if we engage in civilization and we follow god's plan all the information shows that
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:41.280]  and strangely enough biden as you know killed the keystone pipeline one month after it was completed
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:48.640]  his first act they raced to finish it hoping trump would allow to open which trump was biden on day
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:55.040]  two administration killed that but now because the word is the oil will go to china not to us
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:01.520]  this is on info wars dot com by administrate approves by the administration approves alaska oil
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:07.120]  drilling project that's been held up for a decade the u.s. interior department said monday that it's
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:16.320]  approving three out of five drill sites proposed by conico philips as part of its willow master
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:24.880]  development plan of the national petroleum reserve in alaska the record of decision
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.920]  denies two of the five drill sites proposed by conico philips losing the project to drill pads
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:37.680]  40 of the interior department said in the statement the actions significantly scaled back the willow
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:43.680]  project within the constraints of valid existing rights under decades-old leases issued by prior
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.480]  administrations by administration decision to grant partial approval of the energy development
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:53.200]  project comes despite objections by environmentalist activists thought about saudi arabia who cite
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:58.960]  concerns about potential climate impacts by drilling activities yeah china and mexico and india
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:05.120]  everybody else can just crank up everything but oh we can't have anything preposterous
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.520]  the coal power plants put out nothing but water vapor and carbon dioxide that sounds scary we know
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:19.600]  plants breathe it so you know the rest of the story all right so you know i've talked about this
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.760]  i basically hit every angle of it we could open the phones up but i got a bunch of guests come
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.800]  up tomorrow we will i'm sure oh and we'll do that three p.m i almost canceled the guests today just
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.600]  take calls because i won't hear your take on this but would you rather have really bad inflation or
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:48.240]  would you have what they're doing here and bank runs we'll see the inflation exposes the monetary
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:54.720]  system bank runs they can blame these banks when as sure as the sun came up this morning and as
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:14:00.480]  sure as it'll set this evening everybody knows monetary policy did this by the raising of interest
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:12.720]  rates after how many years 2008 to now 13 15 years of just helicoptering money to the elites first
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:20.560]  that it trickles down to us and now that spigots been turned off what are the fed raises rates again
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:28.880]  so we've been maneuvered into this position and there is no easy way out of it other than
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.760]  having a referendum a movement on the public awakening to abolish the federal reserve
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.360]  have major real monetary hearings that bring us back to a growth economy that america is open
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:43.760]  for business again and we're not going to do the central bank digital currencies and the social
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.280]  credit scores and the carbon taxes and all the things that are the next phase because
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.880]  just like they give us bridges to nowhere oh we're going to be in gasoline and diesel cars
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:59.520]  and trucks but and lawnmowers and golf cars or anything else but and weed eaters but and tractors
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.960]  but we've got electric ones coming out that cost twice as much and there's not enough
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.600]  material the rarest minerals to build them and they admit that
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.840]  and there's not enough coal powers in a ratio to fund it to give it the energy
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:22.640]  they give you bridges to nowhere oh don't worry we got a we got a central bank digital currency
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.640]  oh we got a social credit score oh we got a carbon tax oh we got a universal basic income
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:31.680]  that will fix them blowing up the old system and then you look at it you're getting out of a nice big
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.000]  powerful ship that just has a leak and all you got is fix it and you're getting into
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:45.840]  an overloaded lifeboat that's guaranteed to sink that's the analogy of where we are

[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:40.960]  republicans something the russians never even did in upcoming us elections prompt the g.o.p
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.680]  calls for more aggressive action against drug cartels yeah the g.o.p said we should start
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:50.560]  targeting drug cartels as terrorists on the border and the president said well we'll just
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:55.760]  meddle in your election and get democrats elected wow talk about open meddling by a neighboring
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:04.560]  country in a brazen screed orbidor ripped into republicans and issued a threat that if they
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:12.960]  don't stop saying things like that he will lead an information campaign information war to ensure
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:18.080]  that the party receives not one vote from hispanics in the future so hispanic america's want open
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:24.080]  borders and human trafficking if we don't become a lawless country like mexico which we are this
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:28.400]  is disgraceful rhetoric from the leader of a deeply corrupt quasi-filled state that lacks
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:33.120]  operation of the chrome sovereignty over its own territory i agree with town halls analysis
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:38.400]  mexican president threatens republicans calling for u.s military to target drug cartels no no
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:41.680]  just let them target your own people and our people just let them run around and murder whatever
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:49.280]  they want meanwhile mexico too dangerous for spring break texas officials say spring breakers
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.200]  need to know though that yes there are many areas of mexico that aren't safe to go to but
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:24:01.120]  there are many areas of the united states like chicago and new york and hell miami for that matter
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:06.800]  let's not sit there and act like florida or tell me houston's a frickin war zone don't go anywhere
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.600]  near south dallas or downtown dallas i mean they won't give you any travel advisories there let me
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.680]  just tell you don't try to go to a museum in dallas unless you got armed bodyguards
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:22.800]  who the hell would send their people into something like that let me tell you the police by the way
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:29.120]  are very good at covering up crime austin texas is a war zone they've cut one third of the police
[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:36.960]  or more never really hits the nose it's bad carjacking's robberies every couple hours but
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:45.120]  almost no news coverage of it the only french benefit is there are almost no police out
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:50.320]  right in traffic tickets but you know right as i got older and stopped speeding i barely even
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.920]  speedy more or less i'm late and i still go like five miles over ten miles i was feeling
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:59.440]  like now i'm gonna go with the flow of traffic used to i was always hauling ass i guess my average
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:05.920]  speed is probably a hundred miles an hour but now i'm an old man or older i don't do that now
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:12.400]  there's no police i'm just like driving around like we're the police of it's a crazy world folks
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.520]  but it's not just police that aren't out dealing with reckless drivers never recklessly drove but
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:24.000]  they're certainly out there no it's biden and we knew this from the laptop we knew it from
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.600]  all his connections but it's as bad as we thought ccp money flowed to the biden family according
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:36.560]  to bank records doc was obtained by the gop house show directly from the chinese subsidiary
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:44.320]  organizations run by their government to biden and his disgusting family but what is the answer
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:52.560]  to all of this well eric swallows well the chinese communist agent on record
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:00.240]  wants to ban conservative news from the military starting with fox news yes that's his answer
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:08.480]  is make them watch cn don't even let them have watered down fox news what an authoritarian
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.680]  dirt bag and remember last week i showed you one in guardian headline where it said there are too
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.800]  many white people in the english hill country we need to get rid of them they're bad remember the
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:23.360]  headline it's disgusting to see all these white people in their own country where their ancestors
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:29.680]  were 10 000 years ago but don't try to do that in saudi arabia or somewhere or wherever else to
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:35.360]  get your ass killed plans to house 400 asylum seekers in one welch village of this 1 000
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:40.800]  500 people branded wholly unsuitable notice same progress but done in europe same thing here
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:45.600]  and these illegals that come in are brainwashed by the left and turned into political armies
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:50.400]  and i've got videos of what happens when white people try to go out and get
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.240]  a gallon of milk or whatever they literally howl and scream and go he's white he's white they stab
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:27:01.920]  him they kill him they rape the girls it's so liberal it's so loving because 90 percent of
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:08.160]  the asylum seekers in europe are military age men and they're both sit they just come running off
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:12.800]  screaming like it's a d-day invasion and they just run off howling into the countryside
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:24.400]  isn't that liberal isn't that loving oh but the globalist elites they live in their high rise
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:29.920]  apartments protected thinking they're all safe from the civilization they're preying on and they hate
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:33.040]  the average left to see somebody they can skin a buck and run a trot line and somebody with a
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:39.280]  bunch of kids and they they hate white people the white liberals and they're they just they see all
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:46.080]  the poor brown people as their minions they're just even though on average brown people in the
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:52.880]  united states per capita by population have more money than whites oh yeah because you didn't know
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:28:01.760]  asians and indians in many cities per capita have more money than anybody else let's see the left
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.560]  doesn't see them as an instinctive enemy because they've been playing race politics for hundreds
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.880]  years in this country and now they've got the majority being brown they can't help but go back
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:18.640]  to racial politics but it's pissing them off because second and third generation brown people here
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:23.360]  even first generation they're from india or other areas are actually adopting pro america they want
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.920]  guns they want security they want private property that they want it all they're like hey i want what
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:32.640]  america was i came here because because i want the security i want the gun i want the bank account
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.960]  i want to be able to travel i want to be able to worship where i want i want to be secure i'll
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:43.840]  take that looks like oh no no no the white people are bad you don't want your rights do you the second

[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.680]  but when we talk about the crew at info wars people behind the scenes the researchers the writers
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:20.720]  they really have been the mvps in this fight and we look at harris and smith and oh and shroyer and

[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:27.600]  all right so it's a massive bailout they're not calling it a bailout and right at the same time
[01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:34.240]  that you have the incredible information it's so over the top coming out that the head of the
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:40.160]  cdc said no they created a bio weapon it came out of the pentagon obama fouchy they're all behind it
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.560]  at the same time all the deep state collusion with all the agencies and corporations illegally
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:51.760]  spying and surveilling way past the first amendment i mean this is totally illegal at the same time
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:56.880]  the truth about the ukraine war is coming out at the same time the truth about the chai coms
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:02.240]  and hunter bidener coming out this father at the same time that every part of their agenda
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:12.800]  including january 6 is blowing up in their face magically this bank s bb silicon valley bank
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:17.840]  they've been messing with for months they decided to not fix it with a couple billion dollars they
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:23.280]  decided to let it go under and then now the crisis begins but they can pose as the saviors
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:26.640]  show pete santella there's a lot to cover you got the news right before i went on air
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:33.360]  outrageously with january 6 with all these documents the fbi accidentally gave over the
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:39.840]  defense last wednesday last tuesday broke last wednesday all now confirmed secret documents
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:48.880]  uh people in the crowd being feds uh provocaturing spying on the defense team the judge has said no
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:55.520]  harm no foul trial goes forward after cancelling trial thursday and friday we should probably
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:00.240]  tackle that right now because you've got your folks inside the trial following it because
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:06.400]  they're weaponizing this office this is a beta test a blueprint a test for all of us right now so
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:13.600]  let's tackle that first then let's plow through everything today alex thank uh thank you very
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.800]  much for having me yet that's right i have uh late breaking news actually coming out of the
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:25.840]  courtroom uh this morning and we were expecting the world was expecting that the you know the judge
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:34.400]  was going to to rule uh fairly weren't we just kidding that's of course not no uh alex we were
[01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:40.560]  expecting that the judge would see all of these motions that were very well prepared and these
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:45.600]  motions uh for those that like to read them like may i suggest you download them you can get them on
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.720]  pacer uh we'll have them published on our websites but basically what uh what they contend with is
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:55.680]  the attorneys have said this is outrageous government conduct and here are the following
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:01.680]  reasons why and they cite law now in previous cases we won't talk about the cases that i've been in
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:08.240]  but identically same issues it's called cases called janks giglio and brady those three things
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.800]  that you never break those rules when you're the government especially when somebody's at trial
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.680]  they want a jury seated well they in fact did that on top of everything else that we know
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:24.160]  that they were held uh from the uh from the defendants from the public uh they are basically
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:31.680]  right in front of the jury uh attempting to deceive the jury uh the fbi agent perjured
[01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:36.880]  uh herself on the stand uh they cited that they also cited uh some documentation where she was
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:43.600]  ordered to remove 338 lines of information now this is the update uh from the court this is
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:49.040]  what you would expect in a court of law but we have lawlessness and i would say that as of this
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:55.040]  morning alex i'm gonna have to call it what it is that judge kelly at this point uh is now
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:37:01.760]  complicit as part of uh this color revolutionary attempt to overthrow the united states of america
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:07.280]  by not doing the right thing and punishing the government and let's be clear in your case they
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:11.520]  got caught withholding evidence and it was you were set free because you were innocent in the
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:18.560]  whole bundy fiasco so this is very rare we talked this morning at like 8 a.m you thought the judge
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.920]  would have to do the right thing he didn't he said all this is wonderful yeah i don't only
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:31.120]  said all this is wonderful um he basically was not only dismissive but rushed uh rushed into
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:37.360]  i mean just stated over and over again shut down the uh the attorneys uh i mean i have just about
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:42.320]  the entire uh transcript highlighter i can give you a couple of things they they were contending with
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:52.560]  uh whether uh the agent miller uh had misrepresented stuff on the record um and and when we when i
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.520]  break this down if you want to get into the details i'm going to just give you the general
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.920]  highlights but this is what the judge did in opposition to what the judge normally would
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:07.600]  have to do under the law now i had a leftist obama appointed um harry reid supported uh
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:13.760]  la rosa judge her name was gloria navarro and when she encountered the same exact uh gross
[01:38:14.720 --> 01:38:19.920]  government misconduct she dismissed the case because when the government does this what
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:25.280]  they've done in the courtroom in this past week uh the punishment goes to the government regardless
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:31.520]  of what uh and let's just add this is now broken as an actual story this is all in the news uh the
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:36.560]  judiciary committee in the house is looking at an investigation of this the judge in the face of all
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:41.680]  that doesn't give a rat's ass because he's part of mordor the special judges they've got in dc
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:46.880]  does not as a matter of fact i'll give you a couple of quotes uh by the judge judge kelly
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:52.560]  everything you've mentioned so far uh is covered in my ruling i've ruled on this and just shuts it
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:57.360]  down i'll give you an example of what uh roger roach was asking the government contended that the
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:03.600]  330 lines that the fbi asian was ordered to remove oh that uh the government stated well that was
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:09.280]  regarding a different case and just glossed right over it well roger roose says uh something doesn't
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.480]  smell right about that what what is that case that uh that they're referring to can we at least get
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:20.960]  that information across examine and the judge said oh that's that's not necessary uh we we go
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:26.080]  ahead and trust your judge will carmen hernan has jumped out there and said why are you trusting
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:30.800]  that the government is doing this now let's go back alex if we could let's remember it says in
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:35.040]  there i've been ordered to destroy evidence that's always illegal they use the term destroy evidence
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:42.080]  the illegal that's that's exactly right and guess what they also not only glossed over okay but the
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:48.800]  agent was allowed once the jury was seated came back in under cross examination and gave hearsay
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:54.720]  testimony assuming that the document that was emailed to enrique terrio that was provided for
[01:39:54.720 --> 01:40:01.440]  or by the fbi informant uh she was just assuming that because she got a report that said that
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:07.840]  he edited modified or or copied it that it came from him literally so it's on a record
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:13.200]  that this lady connected to the cia and fbi brings them the 1770 document about i can't i plan to
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.040]  attack dc and so now they're even bringing in things and falsely testifying on things
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:26.880]  that are known not to be true that that's exactly right the the judge was heavily siding with uh
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:33.120]  with their prosecution um in opposition to the law now as i said i left this judge when the
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:39.520]  government commits such gross outrageous government misconduct they dismissed the case right there on
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:45.520]  the spot this is total total weaponization it is not only weaponization but uh i'm going to tell you
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:51.120]  something um uh they they they have asked for a special master to come in and take a look at
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:57.760]  certain items that's a reason we request uh to hold off on uh on the jury to put the jury out
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:03.760]  the judge refused to do that refused to see uh any evidence whatsoever said it was irrelevant
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:10.320]  i'm going to let this and shut these attorneys down uh as any tyrant would certainly do that's
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:15.280]  involved and complicit in a color revolutionary overthrow of the united states of america now
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:21.120]  alex here's the most important part uh i have been uh kind of quiet about it in the public
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.800]  because i was hoping it would flesh flesh out uh in the proud boys trial in the courtroom there
[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:32.800]  are whistleblowers internally uh that's tucker had indicated there was facial recognition
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.560]  of the individuals at that front line breach that first breach where the barricades were where the
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:43.360]  guy ryan samshell with the red hat was and ray epps was whispering in his ear they have
[01:41:43.360 --> 01:41:48.800]  internal whistleblowers who are uh they're prohibited from volunteering this information
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:54.800]  but if called to testify would certainly do that they found that the majority of the people at
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:00.880]  that first breach were feds in fact it was a difficult time finding people to prosecute the
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:06.960]  majority of them i will state now that will have to be stated by those whistleblowers if called
[01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:11.760]  to testify but in most cases the judges and this has been the pushback the attorney say
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:17.840]  the judge will shut it down because they're on a fishing expedition this evidence exists
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:23.360]  tucker carlson admitted to that last week there is plenty of evidence of all these federal agents
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.880]  quite a few of them why can't we see it because it might reveal that they were the ones that were
[01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.920]  in fact breaking the law and provocative touring and causing people to do things they normally
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:40.560]  wouldn't do there's so much overwhelming evidence of what these known agents up to and including by
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:47.280]  the way there were military personnel that were actually commandeered and used for special purposes
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:54.000]  on january 6 under the authority of a g rosen he unilaterally decided to set up a special
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.720]  command oh i stay right there let's talk about that we come back ladies and gentlemen info wars

[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:32.080]  all right reach out and how huge this is you're not bs seeing you are literally uh
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:38.320]  all over this with your sources inside the trial i can confirm what you're saying from my sources
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:42.960]  that they are not letting tucker corals and others have access to the face scanning but
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:46.720]  according to people that are ready to go public but under the law and under the regulations in
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.320]  four years and they're nondisclosures they've got to be called they can't even approach congress
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:56.560]  which is totally wrong uh but we know they've been blocking fbi whistleblowers at congress
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:48:01.440]  regardless that the facial recognition software and other systems confirm the majority of the
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:06.800]  people leading the first breach with ray epps directing it were military and fbi well we
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:11.520]  know there was hundreds of fbi and hundreds of military they admitted declassified documents
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:18.240]  there so this is outrageous please continue yeah now the uh remember there was a special forces
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.040]  team commandos fully outfitted they weren't in civilian clothes they were stationed through
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.840]  30 miles away in quantico uh for weapons of mass destruction because the president the vice
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:32.560]  president were on property for the event they were 30 miles away to deploy in the event something
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:39.520]  happens a g rosen on the morning of january 6 actually got quote unquote intel that the fbi
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:45.760]  was under threat of attack and the fbi uh through rosen without any congressional oversight or
[01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:52.480]  capital police knowledge deployed special forces in so they had military styles you know heavily
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:59.280]  armed uh special forces commandos would shoot to kill authority and there were civilian clothes
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:05.200]  military personnel joint terrorist terrorism task force members the reason why they do this
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:10.400]  alex is you don't want to know why each department has rules of engagement and laws that they can
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.600]  operate in under the law the reason why they have these joint terrorism tasks for us is because if
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:21.120]  the fbi has authority to do one thing they essentially meld them into their operating unit
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:25.040]  that way they cover the broad base of laws that they should ever decide to violate here's the
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.080]  bottom line we got to move to other issues but this is huge we'll cover it more soon
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:34.240]  in next hour with this another guest you're gonna ride shuck in with us but this could bring down the
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:38.560]  whole deep state they bet everything on this they're desperate to get rid of trump they're so scared
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:43.440]  they're suppressing things in this trial that's all coming out now but if they admitted it it would
[01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.640]  come out so they're just hoping they can suppress it now this is desperate this i'm going to say this
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:55.600]  exclusively right here on the in on info wars on the alex jones show they don't want anyone to see
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:00.160]  the facial recognition because there's a couple of people that i've already identified and have seen
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:06.240]  the facial recognition of ukranians that were on the ground azov battalion members that are
[01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:11.520]  associated and connected to john mccain lindsay graham dating all the way back to the overthrow
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:16.960]  that's why they don't want us to see the facial recognition those people were in the crowd evan
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:26.160]  newman uh was also a ukranian uh color revolutionary protester he was able to evade f behind they let
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:31.200]  him go actually and he escaped to belarus some complexities there more to come hopefully it'll
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:38.000]  get blown up in court the truth shall set us free of course that always comes out all right shifting
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:44.480]  gears everything's coming out the gain of function uh just so many big issues the illegal spying with
[01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:51.520]  censorship and now we have the banking crisis right on time you know i'm i'm going to call it
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:58.480]  what it is this is a um it is a a controlled demolition of our financial system what do
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:04.400]  they say qui bono who gains to benefit from the destruction of the dollar probably this guy right
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:10.800]  here that wrote executive order 14067 that number that general flinn spoke of just the other day
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:17.920]  14067 is a 17 page document i just held up that outlines the implementation of the central
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:24.560]  uh uh digital currency now here's another thing that we're not tying into this a lot of these banks
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:31.360]  as i'm being told by an internal u.s bank uh executive is that ftx had a lot to do
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:36.880]  uh with these banks that are defaulting these smaller banks associated with ftx and another
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:43.520]  company called tether guess who tether is and who they're connected to um we have been able to
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:50.160]  connect that a they don't have a good accounting nothing's on the books and b their central
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:56.560]  intelligence agency connected tether was responsible for a lot of this ftx stuff uh a lot
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:03.520]  of ukrainian money flowing back during the um uh during the campaign in 2022 but this mismanagement
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:11.120]  of the ftx fund with this uh uh this young group of loachards uh i think was helping and and pre
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:15.280]  planning this controlled demolition and they're right on schedule with this of course they're
[01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:22.160]  going to be acquiring these smaller banks like svb they go belly up for 200 billion dollars and i
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:27.440]  just found out this morning that hsbc bought the uk division for a buck something they're
[01:52:27.440 --> 01:52:31.920]  going to buy pennies on the dollar so what do they do take them down buy them up for pennies on
[01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:37.680]  the dollar and whisk away the evidence uh of tether's involvement and of course the black
[01:52:37.680 --> 01:52:43.280]  money involvement in bringing this banking system down for what purpose take down cryptocurrencies
[01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:49.360]  of course set up their own and come in with a new digital centralized uh controlled system
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:54.720]  man p you just crystallized in two minutes what i tried to say in the whole first hour
[01:52:55.360 --> 01:53:04.080]  incredible job here is axios now calling it the largest bank run in history uh but
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:08.800]  biden saying it's not a bailout but it is a bailout because he's guaranteeing all the deposits
[01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:13.920]  where do you see this going bank stocks tumble others rise on hopes for easier rates what do you
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:20.320]  think well i i not what i think what i know and i studied this uh that i'm not not to claim black
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:27.440]  bragging rights on this but i studied the subprime mortgage meltdown in 2008 the subprime lending
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.840]  debacle obama was behind that believe it or not it fueled this political campaign i did forensic
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:36.960]  audits of a lot of the mortgages he had come and that's a method of money laundering to these
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:42.960]  political campaigns to organize crime these organized criminals outside of the mortgage
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:47.440]  industry in the banking industry they know how to move money like this and they also know
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:51.680]  that all they had to do instead of going to congress for 800 billion dollars like they
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:54:00.160]  had to do in 2008 uh hank paulson that is well they implemented um the uh the dod uh uh frank
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:05.440]  bill which essentially allows them instead of going through congress and taking extra time
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:11.040]  why not just go with the uh deposits that are in the bank now there was going to be outrage
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:14.560]  initially any brajo biden mentioned at this morning he said oh it's not going to come from
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:19.520]  the taxpayers it's going to come from the fees well who's paying the fees i mean there's no
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:24.880]  robots that are generating these fees it's ultimately money that's coming from the consumer
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:32.880]  and fees are another word for bail ins fees are another word for bail this is a uh a bailout
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:38.880]  they they i think they got caught off guard surprised by the magnitude of the bank that
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:46.080]  was being taken down with uh svb svb over 250 billion dollars in assets that's a huge hit
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:50.880]  that's the type of thing that causes the contagion that results in trillions of dollars
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:56.080]  unraveling because there's downstream uh debtors and investors that are impacted by this when
[01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:59.760]  somebody can't pay exactly they've been getting fever see ready in all these hearings we've seen
[01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:04.400]  for a new banking crisis but they weren't ready yet to use it to get the central
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:09.600]  mechanism currencies it looks like they've been caught off guard they were caught off guard uh the
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:13.760]  fdic announced what they were going to do just weeks ago they said we're going to shut the banks
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:20.800]  out on a friday let the institutional investors get their money out well guess what the fdic
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:26.560]  only has 125 billion dollars to cover the remaining balance of all that stuff whether
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:32.880]  you're insured or not they call that they will call that an uninsured deposit and you're out of
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:39.040]  luck and your money is wiped out so this thing would have caused civil unrest if he did not uh
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.760]  basically lie to us as they normally do the question is ladies and gentlemen can you believe
[01:55:43.760 --> 01:55:48.560]  anything coming out of their mouths just go back a couple of years or remember 14 days of flatten a
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:52.960]  curve that should tell you everything you need to know and here's the last thing the people that
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.720]  are at the podium offering any solution those are the perpetrators of the crimes that's exactly
[01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:06.640]  how you ID who these people are behind the scenes taking our system down i know you've been a
[01:56:06.640 --> 01:56:10.960]  financial guy the whole time so you're an expert on this but you really just called it what can

[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:50.160]  agree how bad do you think this is going to get uh i think that uh we must prepare for and it is
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:55.840]  war it's economic warfare and psychological warfare being perpetrated upon us um if you
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:03.440]  remember the name larry graph wall uh he said early on when he was uh internally in the bedroom of
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.480]  or the living room of bill eras they were pre-planning this all these columbia university
[01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:14.640]  intellectuals said they would eventually just track trace profile us put us in education camps
[01:57:14.640 --> 01:57:19.840]  and then those that don't get along will exterminate and they'd use cloud and pivot and blow the
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:24.080]  economy to give us another thumb guys pull up larry graph wall clip we'll play it next hour
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:29.040]  where he talked about their columbia university with the weathermen uh where they were openly

[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:25.120]  dot com coming up p centelio centeli uh peter centeli dot com is here with us now
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:30.240]  other big issues that are out there for you on the radar right now peter centeli
[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:39.520]  you know uh we're in this major investigation going on uncovering the uh the the cartel deeply
[02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:45.120]  embedded in bribing public officials uh and this is not conspiracy theory even al capo through his
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.560]  through his testimony and also leaks through his attorney that these politicians have ever
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:55.200]  wondered why the system is so corrupt like the judges like kelly they're on the payroll they
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:01:00.240]  get bribed they get their trinkets on the side they get the these mortgage refinances we're
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:05.920]  investigating that and uh it's not a conspiracy theory because the president of mexico is on the
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:12.160]  payroll of the centelo cartel the uh fbi director was just uh brought up for trial but that is a
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:18.640]  major major investigation going on and it's easy to uh to to to to see the anomalies when you do
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:24.720]  open source research uh because mortgages and title is out in the open so we're going after
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:29.920]  we suspect uh are corrupt criminals we're going to expose them and by the way that was my next
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:34.080]  point it's like the season of exposure everything the globalists are doing right now is being exposed
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:38.560]  to the mexican president who literally is known to work for centelo cartel says if you target our
[02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:43.840]  cartels we'll throw your elections i mean they talk about russian collusion here's a head of state
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:50.080]  saying i'll control your election al chapo said out of his prison cell at adx in colorado several
[02:01:50.080 --> 02:01:55.040]  stories below ground that if it weren't for the american politicians on the payroll he would have
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:02:00.800]  never been as successful as he was that tells you everything you need to know but you know back
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:04.960]  back to the point you asked me a question as to what i think needs to be done where we're going
[02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:10.800]  they will they ought they have been planning for decades to categorize us get us reeducated those
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:16.480]  that won't uh like me uh that are belligerent won't comply uh they'll exterminate us that this is
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:21.280]  coming folks they've spoken of it they've even started it with releasing a bio weapon they have
[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:26.960]  no qualms with killing millions and millions of people uh wrapped in an american flag dressed as a
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:32.320]  medical industrial complex person so this is coming to us but what we can do is at the county and
[02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:36.800]  state level let's get with our sheriffs start prosecuting the people at these hospitals that
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:42.880]  have been killing people in our communities with remdesivir let's shut down these computer systems
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:48.880]  that are being controlled back end by companies that are foreign like ericsson corporation
[02:02:48.880 --> 02:02:54.240]  and i connectiv they have a way to technologically get into our systems and it's being run by a foreign
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:59.360]  corporation called ericsson and they were given the authority to do that by the fcc huge things
[02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:04.960]  we can do but it has to happen at the county level think your residents think your county
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:11.680]  think your state and guess what we can just opt out of that 10 square miles uh just as we did in
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:18.480]  1776 uh have a declaration of freedom and just basically don't even speak to them we will just
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.400]  do our own thing and do it right at the county level that's what i believe we need to do and
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:30.480]  stand in the gap peacefully i might add communist romania they wanted uh laszlo tokes the the pastor
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:35.200]  will chow chest you that communist dictator um wanted to come get him because he had a church
[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:41.520]  with some young people that were very vigorously um proclaiming their faith in jesus christ um
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:46.240]  the people stood in the gap uh a few started in the candlelight vigil said if you want our pastor
[02:03:46.240 --> 02:03:51.280]  you gotta come past us they stood there peacefully they say you know tens of millions of people
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:55.680]  joined and stood in the gap now of course some people died because chow chest you shot them
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:02.640]  because what communism will disintegrate the police the military the bureaucracy will disintegrate
[02:04:02.640 --> 02:04:09.840]  when we decide to just completely and totally become the most ungovernable batch of belligerents
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:14.240]  well that's right we have to call their bluff it'll be a thousand times worse if we don't
[02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:16.960]  we're gonna have to go through some pain here folks but we've got to do it

[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:34.480]  i brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:42.240]  you know we we become responsible then for administrating you know 250 million people
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:50.480]  and there was no answers no one had given any thought to economics how are you gonna
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:56.000]  clothe and feed these people the only thing that i could get was that they expected that the
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  cubans and the north vietnamese and the chinese and the russians would all want to occupy different
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:07.680]  portions of the united states they also believe that their immediate responsibility would be to
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:14.640]  protect against what they call the counterrevolution and they felt that this counterrevolution could
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:21.600]  best be guarded against by creating and establishing reeducation centers in the southwest
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.880]  where we would take all the people who needed to be reeducated into the new way of thinking
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:36.080]  and teach them how things were going to be i asked well what is going to happen to those
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:43.280]  people that we can't reeducate that are diehard capitalists and the reply was that they'd have
[02:07:43.280 --> 02:07:49.440]  to be eliminated and when i pursued this further they estimated that they would have to eliminate
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:57.680]  25 million people in these reeducation centers and when i say eliminate i mean kill 25 million
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:08:06.720]  people i want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people most of which have graduate degrees
[02:08:06.720 --> 02:08:17.120]  from columbia and other well-known educational centers and hear them figuring out the logistics
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:22.320]  for the elimination of 25 million people and they were dead serious
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:31.680]  and that all came on court all confirmed where grass wall green rave vietnam they recruited him
[02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:35.920]  in the weather underground he approached the FBI and said they want me to join this he did and he
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:39.920]  helped bring down the people that advised obama well it's been a long time since doug hagman's
[02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:44.560]  been on he's had a lot of stuff going on and we've been praying for him he's a great guy you know we
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:48.800]  really are going to reach out to him even though it's been a few years now for the death of his
[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:54.160]  son but he has been back in the saddle for quite a bit of time fighting hard and he's here with us
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:58.880]  he's a great researcher and a very well known successful private detective and even well
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:03.760]  more well known talk show host and he of course he also knows well pete santelli who'll leave us
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:07.520]  here in a couple segments but i wanted him to be able to pop in with things he can add to this
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:15.600]  investigation uh but uh mr hagman great to have you on with us hagman pi.com uh the
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:19.280]  subjects i wanted to get you on are the exact subjects you sent over you wanted to talk about
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:22.560]  what do you want to tackle first my friend and good to have you back on in fours
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:29.280]  elix thanks for having me on i appreciate it and uh i appreciate all you do uh pete i
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:33.440]  appreciate you i've been following your latest investigative work and i gotta tell you it's right
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:39.280]  and spot on i went through the paperwork of judge kelly and the in all of the
[02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:48.400]  rulings during the during that trial and i was surprised to hear i guess it was just breaking
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:57.120]  just moments ago or earlier today about the kelly's ruling so pretty i mean not surprising but but
[02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:03.520]  certainly um it's disconcerting at this day the least so thank you pete for what you're doing
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:08.000]  elix of course thank you for everything you've done and i appreciate being back on you were the
[02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:13.200]  first guy i heard about hunter biden's laptop from you'd heard about from the state police uh and
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:19.280]  that was gonna be coming out right here yeah copy uh i have a i have a copy of this hard drive right
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:23.680]  here i'm holding a copy of this hard drive i'm sorry about that i mean yeah i'm holding a copy
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:30.720]  of this hard drive i've got two copies one with and one without the uh uh shall i say personal
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:35.360]  things and well at the time you said it was pedophile stuff and everybody's like oh then
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:40.800]  later it came out and now it's just kind of normalized isn't it yeah yeah absolutely and
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.800]  that's the intent that was the intent of everything the normalization of pedophilia
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:50.080]  we see that taking place right now we we everything that that you and i've spoken about you've
[02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:56.800]  spoken about pete's been speaking about it has really come to pass and that is where we are right
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:02.240]  now should not be unexpected and of course you wrote about it in your book uh the great reset
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:08.160]  which i've got a copy a couple of copy uh copies i appreciate that as well so you know here we are
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:15.280]  january six by the way i think people are missing the boat on that i i i absolutely um uh i don't
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.280]  want to say can verify but i've heard the same thing pete centrally said about the official
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:26.160]  recognition and so on but a bigger aspect of that just very quickly is why you know what happened
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:33.200]  on january six and why it happened uh conservative treehouse did an analysis and i copied some of
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:40.160]  the analysis and put it up on my website but the fact is this was in an opera this was an operation
[02:11:40.160 --> 02:11:46.400]  in order to prevent congress from delaying the certification of the state electoral votes
[02:11:46.400 --> 02:11:54.320]  which required a crisis and that crisis or an emergency um invokes special house rules
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:12:01.680]  so about three minutes before uh they were going to vote or discuss the uh motion to
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:10.640]  uh delay certification of state electoral votes the top brass uh Pelosi Pence of course Schumer
[02:12:10.640 --> 02:12:16.320]  and mcconnell were escorted out of the chambers and that subject never came up again into the
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:20.800]  the night one two three in the morning so the bottom line is people are looking away from
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:28.560]  that that vote it delayed the vote and by delaying the vote i should add this it creates a position
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:35.920]  that takes away standing in the supreme court setting which is why none of the cases ostensibly
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:42.240]  why none of the cases went through the supreme court um didn't allow a smaller number of senators
[02:12:42.240 --> 02:12:49.600]  to vote and push it through well that too i mean there were a number of different facets but the
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:53.840]  bigger objective was accomplished and that was not to challenge the electoral votes
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:59.360]  so we all had a rally to say we don't believe the election wanted today investigation they
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:04.880]  hijacked part of our rally wanted to be far worse but still hyped it up as a pretext to
[02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:12.800]  them be able to go ahead and certify things about an investigation yeah i mean i mean the uh you
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:16.880]  would think that this could have been done another way but they exploited the situation Pelosi did
[02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:24.160]  primarily and then of course you had Schumer as well as mcconnell who's very guilty as well as
[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:30.080]  Pence um invoking an emergency status changing the rules and then of course uh preventing two
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:35.520]  motions that were about to be presented before congress requiring the speaker of the house
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:40.000]  and minority leaders and the president of the congress to be present and of course they were
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:44.160]  escorted from the chambers and the rest is history and that's the so it was mission
[02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:51.680]  accomplished in that respect wow please continue and then i want your take on where this is going
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:55.520]  because january six is clearly blown up their face they're very very scared of it
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:01.520]  and then it's your other point and then and then you're you're viewing where this is going
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:08.720]  well i i think that uh i think that you know i was listening to Pete during the uh earlier
[02:14:08.720 --> 02:14:15.280]  during the hour and i think what he said about kelly and about the infestation and the criminality
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:20.320]  of our of our we don't have a justice system we have a legal system that masquerades is a justice
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:28.080]  system i think that that is all playing into um the everything's connected the uh what we're
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:33.520]  seeing with the banks what we saw with uh the the lockdowns all of this is interrelated and i
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:41.040]  think people are have to take both a granular look at things but also a view from maybe cruising
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:47.680]  altitude 30 40 000 feet um so i think everything that we're seeing happen today with the banks
[02:14:47.680 --> 02:14:54.160]  with the bail ins and these are bail ins i mean for crying out loud call them what you want redefine
[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:59.280]  everything what you want um what we're seeing right now is this push and and you stated this
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:04.560]  and you wrote about it this push toward this digital monetary conopticon of surveillance
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:10.000]  and control uh digital currency central bank digital currency and i think that's where the
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:17.520]  objective is the next objective as we see more banks fall is there a way for us now that we're
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:22.640]  already in the jaws of this to mitigate it or can we just say we don't want the solution of
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:27.040]  the central bank digital currency and all the carbon taxes and social credit score that come
[02:15:27.040 --> 02:15:30.560]  with it i mean is this already too late to stop this when we come back we'll talk about it with
[02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:36.320]  both of you men or what can we do in this in this key time we're all living in right now

[02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:16.960]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones the answer to 1984 is 1776 great doug hagman and
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:21.280]  he sent tillie here riding shotgun with his pizza and leave it in this segment he's got a few
[02:20:21.280 --> 02:20:25.280]  comments to make i appreciate him holding over and i'm gonna continue on with doug hagman
[02:20:25.280 --> 02:20:31.440]  but but but but doug big picture i see trump coming out saying oh look signature bank
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:38.080]  banned him after january 6 and uh you know i see the effects of her pushing lgbtqp all that
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:41.600]  and i've had a few people call me and say oh isn't this really the good guys taking down the money
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:49.600]  laundering operation of sam bankman fried and what was happening with ftx is there anything to that
[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:55.680]  because the system does seem somewhat caught off guard by this we know they want to bring down the
[02:20:55.680 --> 02:21:00.480]  regional banks don't want lending but it does seem like they have their central bank digital
[02:21:00.480 --> 02:21:08.000]  currency ready i mean is there any silver lining to this well i i'd like to think there would be
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:15.360]  but i think a lot of that is hopium and and uh i'm not you know addicted to hopium um you know
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:21.840]  look i i don't know i don't have any specific information except that um i would say that
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:27.680]  you know what pete would pitcentilly said earlier who benefits uh we have to look at
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:33.920]  who benefits i mean look at the lockdowns um now i don't want to encroach on on peace time but look
[02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:39.040]  look at the lockdowns that we endured who benefited from that and of course at the end of the day i
[02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:44.640]  think the the globalist agenda is being pushed upon us and i think this is all part of it where
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:52.160]  you have the the banks are um well they're overextended bad loans bad the bad investments and
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:22:01.760]  the bad management i mean i mean the ceo of of the silicon bank he did admit me a culpa in a
[02:22:01.760 --> 02:22:09.040]  tracksuit from one of the one of the biggest and best golf resorts in scotland i mean for crying out
[02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:14.640]  loud you know um you can't make this stuff up so i don't know i'd like to see sir silver lining i
[02:22:14.640 --> 02:22:19.200]  don't think this has anything to do with good guys but then again like could be wrong i'd like to
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:22.160]  know i mean i mean i think you're right i want to get pete's take on that but i mean here's an
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:26.240]  example everybody oh sam bankman frat he's a crook he was laundering money for the democrats
[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:29.760]  that'll bring him down now it's bringing down all the crypto and the cryptos all were all a good
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:35.280]  idea and a good thing so the globalist set these people up for falls and because part of a globalist
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:39.600]  operation is being blown up that's more of a detonator blow us all up in my view beat santella
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:45.600]  your view on that and other comments you know uh if you recall just several weeks ago the ftx
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:51.440]  debacle had come about and guess what they always say follow the money follow the money well if you
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:59.200]  follow the money ftx uh had an international operation um spf said that the international
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:04.560]  operation brought uh ftx down well you tracked that all the way back to the ukraine the new world
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:12.080]  orders piggy bank and then you factor in a couple of things uh who benefits from the takedown of us
[02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:19.440]  belligerents that are out there trading uh crypto currencies in bitcoin um who benefits with that
[02:23:19.440 --> 02:23:25.360]  takedown and then you take a look at silvergate that just what two weeks ago was was the first
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:33.680]  canary in the coal mine as far as banks that unfolded well ftx the bank that held the ftx money
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:41.360]  was silverbank uh now of course uh this this c they're literally connected to the cia we
[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:49.360]  track them of course we don't have uh clearance but really shady shady um uh outfit uh known as
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:54.560]  tether tether doesn't have an accounting of anything they've already been fined in the millions of
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:24:00.240]  dollars by the sec for running roughshot they are at the top of the food chain uh as far as the
[02:24:00.240 --> 02:24:06.560]  cryptocurrencies are concerned well guess what tether is about to unravel um the uh the banking
[02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:11.440]  system that was holding ftx silvergate just unraveled and most of these banks that are unraveling
[02:24:11.440 --> 02:24:17.120]  right now are connected and heavily invested in cryptocurrency now marry that in parallel with
[02:24:17.120 --> 02:24:24.640]  of course joe biden's uh 17 page executive order to bring in a centralized uh digital currency
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:30.880]  um who benefits from the takedown of cryptocurrency outside of the centralized system you we know
[02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:37.040]  the centralized bankers uh deal they they want to basically destroy uh and have their own monopoly

[02:25:42.400 --> 02:25:46.400]  to get on so i want to get you want to talk about pouches a cost interview the pillaging or monetary
[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:55.120]  system uh and and more so start taking it away here well okay about the fouchie a cost interview
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:25:59.200]  i think it lasted nine and a half minutes i've looked at it from the prism or through the prism
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:06.800]  as an investigator um and i've seen i've done i've i've conducted a lot of interviews myself with
[02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:13.040]  criminal suspects with witnesses and such i've been on both sides of the glass so to speak
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:21.040]  in the interview rooms and i watched that and i watched him i watched found fouchie minimize his
[02:26:21.040 --> 02:26:27.280]  involvement first of all in the first part of this uh with respect to the release of the bioweapon
[02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:35.520]  known as SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 and then i watched as well uh and a lot of times when when when you
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:41.280]  have a a suspect or a person they minimize their involvement especially when they're guilty that's
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:47.600]  a tactic of the of the guilty i'm not saying that's a case here i'm saying it matches that that the
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:55.360]  context so when i saw that i thought my goodness you know this guy is telegraphing um his guilt
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:27:00.720]  right on national television and then as the interview progressed he's he was confronted with
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:05.920]  the fact well some people want you biocostas saying some people want to see you and and you know
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:16.880]  charged and put in jail and you know most innocent people um would be absolutely outraged and um
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:23.200]  the reaction would not be like fouchies was okay fouchies was tempered and saying for what you
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:31.520]  know and a complete denial again fitting a very very narrow um behavioral profile at least in my
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:36.240]  view based on my investigative analysis of the interview and i think this is perhaps one of the
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:44.000]  most telling interviews um even even the head-to-head between fouchie and ran paul in congress that
[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:51.040]  that was a very contentious situation this is fouchie in familiar territory friendly territory
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:56.080]  the cost is saying hey you know why not you know and take it easy don't it's okay you know you can
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:28:02.880]  almost see that back and forth and then for him to really number one again attempt to minimize his
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:13.120]  um um his role in the natural origin story and then to say well it could be both and twist
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:18.720]  himself in the pretzel um saying that trying to cover all the bases and the lies he told what he
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:22.720]  said now when we come back we'll talk more about this because you are a crime expert and and reading
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:27.520]  people but we have the former head of the cdc turning states evidence i'm sure you saw some of
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:33.120]  it saying no it was created here it was sent to china fouchie ran it he's lying uh this is the
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:38.960]  biggest uh you know bio leak ever gain a function they did it i mean redfield was the only got two
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:42.960]  years ago that wouldn't say it didn't come from a lab well it turns out he he knows so he's not
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:47.920]  going down with the ship how big is that and how do they contain that uh this is such a big deal

[02:32:54.480 --> 02:33:05.600]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:14.720]  oh
[02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:35.840]  oh
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:42.400]  all right doug hagman is our guest great researcher he sent me an article that's not to be
[02:33:42.400 --> 02:33:46.560]  here's how the government plans to stop more banks from crumbling and turning
[02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:52.880]  the second to a full-blown banking crisis let's let's continue along that line in a minute but
[02:33:52.880 --> 02:33:58.960]  first let's get back to Fauci we had cost to interview i saw that this weekend and i actually
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:03.600]  meant to play it sunday and i meant to get to it today because it's so incredible he gets up there
[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:09.600]  he says everyone agrees that it didn't come out of a lab then he goes on to say no we looked at
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:16.320]  both sides we we don't know where it came out of and so yeah this is like he's not being interrogated
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:22.160]  by an fbi agent or by a lawyer he has a friendly guy there with him and he just comes off as
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:26.800]  completely incredible plus we don't need to know he's incredible we have all the documents we
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:31.360]  know what went on we have the emails we have the whistleblowers so speak to that and then where you
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:36.480]  think this goes from here because i don't see how it comes out that the fbi framed people and
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:42.400]  destroyed evidence and then the judge just says i don't care i don't see how it comes out they had
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:46.720]  provocateurs and that the q shaman was let in and you know brought in and was taking selfies with
[02:34:46.720 --> 02:34:50.640]  the cops like he said but the judge wouldn't let his court case i don't see how it comes out they've
[02:34:50.640 --> 02:34:55.920]  opened the borders on purpose or shipped in fentanyl that's killed so many and you know of our of our
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:01.760]  families and just all of it's coming out the illegal spying with surveillance beyond the first
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:06.720]  amendment i'm not saying first amendment is important when i said friday that's a side issue
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:10.400]  we all know they're censoring violent first amendment and have a bunch of agencies with
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:15.600]  government and corporations and think tanks and dinosaur media and big tech in dashboard
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:20.640]  surveilling and censoring and shutting down quote the truth for monetary gain i mean
[02:35:20.640 --> 02:35:25.600]  it's the definition of organized crime and racketeering so here's my question i'm ranting
[02:35:25.600 --> 02:35:30.320]  why would you quantify the moment we're in because i think they're burning down in front of us but i
[02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:36.400]  think that makes them the most dangerous because they could they could do anything now no i agree
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:42.800]  with you 100 i think i think right now we're at a nexus we're the hinge moment in history we're
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:49.760]  at a nexus point where the uh they're lying we know they're lying they know we know they're lying
[02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:56.400]  and that makes them super dangerous the super dangerous because they don't care right now
[02:35:56.400 --> 02:36:05.520]  they really don't care if if their plans plots and schemes are are visible to everyone because
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:09.440]  they're the way they're looking at it is what the heck are you going to do about it
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:15.680]  you know so here we are we're going to advance this agenda and the agenda as we all know of
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:22.960]  course is open borders attack on our of course borders language culture as mark levin says
[02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:30.720]  us we see the intelligence community the doj weaponized against you and me and people like us
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:38.240]  moms at school boards dads and moms at council meetings we we what we we're seeing here and oh
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:47.440]  by the way all all of that is in somewhat of an artifact from barak hussein obama eric holder
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:54.000]  and people forget about so many headlines i mean people forget about the the chiro speech he made
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:59.360]  and people forget about you know going going back into oh wait the made on revolution the color
[02:36:59.360 --> 02:37:10.960]  revolution in ukraine cement the powers role and others so i mean victoria newland and obama
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:18.400]  the uh uh arab spring people are forgetting about the groundwork that's being laid heck people have
[02:37:18.400 --> 02:37:24.000]  even forgot about east palestine already which is just about an hour and a half south of me so
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:30.800]  with all of with everything that's coming forth right now i believe we are facing the most dangerous
[02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:36.000]  time or we are in the most dangerous time in in american history at least recent american history
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.880]  because and by the way i think that's all that that's an understatement i mean there's no doubt
[02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:46.320]  you're right it's it's so dangerous with russia and tactical nukes and just all of it it's
[02:37:46.320 --> 02:37:51.040]  historically a deflection point as you said or a nexus point where things cascade and then it's a
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:59.040]  chain reaction we're in the chain reaction right now exactly and and you know um yeah it's at this
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:05.200]  point you know to coin uh or to paraphrase uh hillary clinton what difference does it make i
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:11.120]  can hear her say that you know right now with respect to all of the revelations and as pete
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:18.240]  said and as you said earlier about um about the january 6th about what happened at that point i mean
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.680]  right now the department of justice they're still going after uh people from january 6th they're
[02:38:23.680 --> 02:38:32.000]  never going to admit the weaponization the plans the integration between the um fbi and yes what
[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:37.760]  what pete said yes i've got the same information about ukrainian assets on the ground in dc well
[02:38:37.760 --> 02:38:44.960]  that they've got they've got videotaped we see them what exactly so i mean but but to get the
[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:50.000]  average person to understand this which is again i'm thankful for for your show to get the average
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:54.960]  person to understand what's happening and how we are being played it's so difficult i don't know
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:39:02.480]  where this is going to go um but i can see um i can look i can see the the fact that russia china
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:09.040]  iran all of these countries look at us as very weak we are our financial system is based on
[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:16.720]  nothing modern monetary theory at best is is what we're seeing now with the banks uh and of course
[02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:24.400]  that's a kind of a bernie sanders aoc stefanie kelton author the book about that that goes back
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:31.360]  a few decades um so with all of this right now we know what's the next thing that's gonna what's
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:36.880]  the next shooter drop i don't know but uh it wouldn't surprise me to to hear that man hattons gone
[02:39:36.880 --> 02:39:42.480]  you know from manuka or something similar because they are advancing their agenda exactly if you
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:49.440]  look at the x if you look at the escalation curve it's parabolic it 100 yes and you hit
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:56.480]  that by the way again i i know i don't want this to sound uh trivial or tripe but but your book the
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:01.600]  great reset really got into that and i learned a lot from the great reset okay your book and i
[02:40:01.600 --> 02:40:07.440]  want to thank you for writing that you've already um i'll tell you what uh everyone should have a
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:14.160]  copy of that because it really outlines everything that you said um and every your your programs really
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:20.880]  for the past uh well since day one and i think that if people understood how big this is and the
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:26.240]  fact that the people in power are laughing at us and if that doesn't piss you off not not you but
[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:31.840]  the people off i i don't know why you know what's it gonna take to get people off the couch oh it
[02:40:31.840 --> 02:40:39.920]  does piss me off because because now it's all out in the open exactly it you know and and this
[02:40:39.920 --> 02:40:45.760]  mass formation psychosis a fancy name for just just being stupid i guess i i look i don't know i
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:53.360]  think people i i don't want to say stupid i i i guess just a sleep so thank you yeah drugged out
[02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:58.960]  and asleep indeed so and uh by the way i want to thank you very much i just want to say this you
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:05.520]  know um it's it's been a rough couple of years since my son died uh he he would be 40 this this
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:14.000]  month and he died three years ago leaving uh no my grandson who's three and a half um i i've got
[02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:22.320]  to say that uh uh that that was a murder scene by the way and i'm i i i thank you for everything
[02:41:22.320 --> 02:41:27.120]  that uh you know you've said and done but uh well i appreciate you i couldn't imagine i have a son
[02:41:27.120 --> 02:41:31.520]  and i know it was very suspicious it took you out of the game some but you know we're oh yeah i mean
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:36.080]  i know you've been here and there but we're we're really glad you're back dogs people need you well
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:43.040]  well thank you but but the the reason i mentioned that is because when i read well uh what really
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:48.160]  hampered me was the the fact that the crime scene was uh or the death scene was not secured and
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:53.120]  it was hampered with and uh things i found that afterwards and and the state of his body afterwards
[02:41:53.760 --> 02:42:01.280]  but but what killed him was fentanyl and i was able to trace the fentanyl from my town to the border
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:05.520]  i know exactly where it came in and i turned that information over to the department of justice
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:10.880]  and they have yet to do anything about that and that pisses me off and i'm sorry for sounding no no
[02:42:10.880 --> 02:42:15.520]  i i have so many friends and people whose kids think they're smoking a marijuana cigarette it's
[02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:20.080]  got fentanyl in them it just kills them i mean i know i know like 10 people who had their kids die
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:26.240]  from vape pens uh or from marijuana lace with it or uh some kid just gives them a pill and tells
[02:42:26.240 --> 02:42:32.560]  them it's nothing and they're dead an hour later which exactly which makes me really believe when
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:38.640]  i look at this and i see the numbers because i do receive um some briefings about the numbers of
[02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:42.880]  or the amount of fentanyl stay there dog stay we'll get into fentanyl this really hit home and killed
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:50.160]  your son it terrifies me because they're lacing everything with it folks babies are on playgrounds

[02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:17.760]  shout back in the devil's face the name of jesus christ folks all right doug hagman's here with
[02:47:17.760 --> 02:47:21.840]  us for a little bit the next hour obviously the war on today's gonna be hotter and hatties with
[02:47:21.840 --> 02:47:27.920]  all the news is breaking three p.m central jones lente always on fire but next hour but uh doug
[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:32.640]  hagman's son died with someone poisoning him with fentanyl and i know doug he'd take responsibility
[02:47:32.640 --> 02:47:37.680]  if that wasn't the case what's happened so much for people will drug people to rob him with fentanyl
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:42.320]  happens really bad in mexico it happens in the dominican republic it happens all over and i literally
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:48.080]  know so many people personally i know everybody listening to us who died of fentanyl uh and of
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:53.600]  course it's made by mit back in the 70s it's a hundred times stronger than the strongest heroin
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:48:00.720]  china is shipping it in mass and i remember i was my ex-wife was divorcing me and i in the
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:04.240]  divorce the money's locked up so i couldn't get another house but the only thing i could find
[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:09.520]  was the three bedroom condominium so i could see my kids i've been out about a month out of the house
[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:14.240]  and uh some friends came over and they said let's go to the sushi place over here i'm not really
[02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:18.720]  like sushi but we went to sushi place and some people were talking crap in the place that happens
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:24.000]  you know quite a bit and i only had one vodka and soda with my sushi so i hadn't been drinking one
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.040]  drink don't even feel that and i felt kind of sick and lightheaded and luckily my apartment was about
[02:48:29.040 --> 02:48:35.520]  300 yards away the apartment building and by the time i got the elevator i was on my knees i don't
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:40.480]  even remember getting to the bed well they also roofed one of my friends he passed out in his car
[02:48:40.480 --> 02:48:45.680]  because he lived another part of austin in the parking garage and woke up six hours later and
[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:49.760]  had the worst hangover ever so that's one problem when you're famous or a patriot people can poison
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:57.120]  you that happened uh and so it's just a you know a really crazy world we live in and and you were
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:00.480]  sitting before the break you tracked the fentanyl you said they left it on your son's keyboard as
[02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:05.360]  well i guess to attack whoever tried to get in there looks like i mean was this a political hit
[02:49:05.360 --> 02:49:10.320]  job or what was this targeting you because i know you got a lot of threats over helping bring down
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:15.920]  weiner you you you help break you know all so much of this stuff i know you were really concerned
[02:49:15.920 --> 02:49:20.160]  right around that time and you're not a drama queen do you think your son was targeted to get
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:27.440]  after you or what do you think happened now you know alex no i look my son was engaged in some uh
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:33.360]  he elevated his risk profile i'll just say it that way all right he was engaged in the activity
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:39.040]  he probably shouldn't have been engaged in with people that he really didn't know he invited
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:46.320]  people over it long story short invited people over along with somebody he knew very well uh
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:52.000]  suddenly he was injected with three times the lethal dose of fentanyl i've got the corners
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:57.760]  report i know about i know more about his body in death than i than i did in life which is not
[02:49:57.760 --> 02:50:04.240]  a good place for a father to be um they left they left him in his house for five hours
[02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:12.080]  roughly five hours um they they robbed him of his valuables they took his identification stole
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:18.480]  his identification and then did some other things um i pressed the district attorney to do a um
[02:50:18.480 --> 02:50:24.560]  to open a murder investigation sadly the crime scene was contaminated so i asked for an equivocal
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:30.720]  death investigation which i which i spearheaded and uh the resulted in one person going to jail
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:37.200]  for 180 days which actually if you look at it no that's not too bad on the on the uh in the scheme
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:42.720]  of things yeah the current atmosphere is they're letting mass shooters out in a week yeah i mean
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:48.640]  it's just ridiculous but but but the i guess the whole point of this is the fact that when you look
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:56.080]  at the fentanyl crisis um and you look at what's taking place we can stop and should stop this
[02:50:56.080 --> 02:51:01.120]  fentanyl coming from coming in because this is a biological weapon as much as if not more than
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:06.800]  the sars-covy too was um now if you're engaged in high-risk behavior i get it you know you're
[02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:11.040]  playing rush that's how the british broke up china was shipping opium in i mean this is not
[02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:18.720]  the first time this has been done no no it's not so uh for the boards we left open by china joe
[02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:27.520]  in in his in his regime um his the his handlers and backers of course this is part of the genics
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:31.440]  program that's a little larger view and that's a good point because this happened to your son
[02:51:31.440 --> 02:51:36.320]  under trump who was trying to control it i've seen numbers of fentanyl what three times what was just
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:44.080]  coming in now what was coming in before oh the numbers are outrageous you've got in one month
[02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:49.760]  they i think it was in november or december they interdicted enough fentanyl to kill every man
[02:51:49.760 --> 02:51:56.560]  moment in child in the united states all right that's how much of a threat that we face and your tv
[02:51:56.560 --> 02:52:03.760]  viewer that's the amount of pure fentanyl it causes to kill a 200 pound person exactly so so people
[02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:09.280]  have to realize that again whether it's the southern border whether it's a banking collapses
[02:52:10.960 --> 02:52:19.520]  you look at everything in kind of a um the entire scene the entire situation is a crime scene all
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:25.120]  by itself i mean this is one big crime scene and at the at the epicenter of this of course are the
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:31.360]  globalists the the china joe biden uh mr potato head whatever you want to call him and the son
[02:52:31.360 --> 02:52:37.280]  hunter the documents on the laptop which have been authenticated obviously uh show his relationship
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:42.080]  to communist china communist chinese party bringing in drugs into the united states to take us down
[02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:49.840]  from within fomenting discord i mean all of this is is all part of that reset great reset plan and
[02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:57.040]  that's in the chinese unconventional war for a document absolutely it is and again you know
[02:52:57.040 --> 02:53:03.760]  when you see a string of um a string of disasters happen and people say well gee whiz you know we've
[02:53:03.760 --> 02:53:10.160]  had fires at that these plants all forever well well no hold on a second you're looking at very
[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:17.520]  specific hub points well plus the trade organizations admit power plant attacks power relay system
[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:22.720]  attacks food plant attacks all of it is up several hundred percent above records this is not an accident
[02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:30.960]  no no and to say it's an accident look i get sometimes the things happen accidents do some of
[02:53:30.960 --> 02:53:38.400]  it is but most of it's right pre premeditated exactly and i think um for example just like on
[02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:43.520]  january 6 okay if you go back to january 6 it uh i don't want to seem like i'm jumping around but
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:49.600]  but the template is pretty much the same what about those pipe bombs on january 6 gee whiz
[02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:55.280]  why haven't we heard anything more about those pipe bombs well when you look at the that the mission
[02:53:56.400 --> 02:54:04.080]  of j6 what what the policy in my view the policy crime family and schumer and the rhinos and
[02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:12.080]  deep state what they had planned was to of course stop the motions of looking at the potentially
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:17.920]  fraudulent electoral electoral votes that was accomplished so they didn't need those pipe bombs
[02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:25.120]  that was more like an insurance policy to what happened on j6 so that just kind of went exactly
[02:54:25.120 --> 02:54:29.920]  they couldn't get people to bust in to just to stop the regular vote for an investigation have
[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:34.880]  the quick vote to certify they were going to detonate pipe bombs to to to to to evacuate the capital
[02:54:36.480 --> 02:54:42.960]  right and and i think again i think that people are waking up and the question i get most often
[02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:49.760]  is well what can we do about this well i'll tell you what um we're i know we're doing all we can
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:54.800]  that's by you know talking to people explaining what's going on but we have to do more and i
[02:54:54.800 --> 02:55:02.320]  think i think we have to uh really start at a local level and uh you know what else i'll just
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:08.800]  say this i don't see this coming to a happy conclusion i i don't see any way out of this i'm
[02:55:08.800 --> 02:55:17.520]  not advocating violence but i i see the options closing very rapidly and when the options close
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:25.040]  and and they continue to double and triple down on us you know where does that leave us so i i'm
[02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:32.720]  kind of pessimistic about the future in terms of the the solutions because they're they're taking
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:38.880]  away the solutions the avenues of redress um and the a the justice system is gone it's it's a legal
[02:55:38.880 --> 02:55:42.640]  system but no justice well you saw what happened to me and it's not about me folks when i say that
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:47.760]  it's about being selfless it's about you two weaponized trials where i was found guilty by judges
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:52.240]  and then juries were told i was guilty and then false financials are given to the juries to have
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:59.920]  giant uh verdicts it's it's it's they're weaponizing everything and they don't care even though they're
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:07.040]  destroying their own future as well you know i i watched that entire when it was what was made
[02:56:07.040 --> 02:56:16.160]  public i watched that entire proceeding and and to say that you were i mean i cannot believe that
[02:56:16.880 --> 02:56:24.000]  well i can't believe it but it it hurts my heart to see a once great country take a patriot
[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:33.040]  and to take away all of the legal forms of redress and um what happened to you was just
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:38.000]  unconscionable i just again um when i when i watched the whole thing it was just hard for
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:43.040]  me to believe you were guilty and we're going to work from there it was it was hard for me to
[02:56:43.040 --> 02:56:52.880]  believe in fact it was surreal man you know but again here we have j6 prisoners right so
[02:56:52.880 --> 02:56:58.480]  they're still in the gulags there's a lot of great talk from some of our congressmen congresswomen
[02:56:58.480 --> 02:57:07.520]  but they're still in the jails of dc uh so you know so if that's the case who's on our side i mean
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:11.600]  what are we gonna do if they're still there i mean why are they still there i'll tell you what the
[02:57:11.600 --> 02:57:16.640]  goodness is let's talk about this the final five minutes it's the whistleblowers and not just in
[02:57:16.640 --> 02:57:21.680]  government but at every level they're i see you agree and we'll talk about that uh because we want
[02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:26.480]  to demonize the fbi all day it's just a captured institution ty jacked it's not our enemy but it

[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:32.720]  let me see but when everything is a lie which it is now there's only one place to find the truth
[03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:39.200]  and it's not in government stats or government reports or declarations it's it's uh it's with
[03:00:39.200 --> 03:00:47.040]  god and i know you speak about that often and i believe we need and i heard steve quill my
[03:00:47.040 --> 03:00:53.040]  buddy steve quill look we need god more more than ever and i know that there are people listening
[03:00:53.040 --> 03:01:02.080]  perhaps i don't believe in god but i'm a big believer in um having faith um even though i'm
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:09.520]  rather pessimistic i do know how the book ends i know i know how the story ends and we do prevail
[03:01:09.520 --> 03:01:16.240]  justice right well there are exactly there are no atheists and foxholes yeah that's very true
[03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:24.640]  is so um but i i think you know i i just i'm looking at the situation i just want people

[03:01:31.520 --> 03:01:37.280]  that there are people out there thinking well you know what's left for me to do one of the things and
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:44.000]  again this is not a shame or this is not a plug uh or meant to be a plug um uh but you know we need

[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:41.920]  that things look bleak but we again we know how the story ends and i think look at everything that
[03:03:41.920 --> 03:03:49.840]  happens not through not with blinders but but with um in the context of a larger agenda think bigger
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:58.160]  look bigger and and look for the connections don't don't create them but look for connections
[03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:01.760]  and then put the pieces together well the good news is the the enemy's burning down there's the
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:06.720]  paradox they haven't fallen yet i use the analogy of that great movie the space of compositor stories
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:11.120]  force 10 from avarone where they blow up the dam it doesn't fall right away and they all panic
[03:04:11.120 --> 03:04:16.080]  the explosive expert goes watch it's gonna fall take about 20 minutes just watch and then i think
[03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:22.240]  we've already blown the enemy we just have to get ready and then stand back amen to that amen and

[03:06:37.520 --> 03:06:42.960]  and i'm very honored to be here with you on this live monday edition about the hand of a ton to
[03:06:42.960 --> 03:06:47.280]  one of the smartest guys i know gerald saloon to the top friends forecaster but i wanted to hit
[03:06:47.280 --> 03:06:55.200]  this story in in closing because it's very illustrative of things people ask why would the
[03:06:55.200 --> 03:06:59.040]  globals come right out and say they want to break up our families or destroy our borders or
[03:06:59.040 --> 03:07:04.160]  bankrupt us to control us you'll have nothing you'll own nothing you'll like it why would australia
[03:07:04.160 --> 03:07:09.200]  which is the model of the world for tyranny in the west right now have national tv drives
[03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:14.640]  showing we need people to join the military to take on other australians and we're going to beat
[03:07:14.640 --> 03:07:20.960]  them over the head with billy clubs and bite them with police dogs because there's a point where
[03:07:20.960 --> 03:07:26.720]  they've got to normalize it and it's got to emerge sure anybody my age or older grew up knowing when
[03:07:26.720 --> 03:07:33.360]  you see this you're in north korea and it's not to stop looters or criminals to stop people breaking
[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:40.400]  quarantines and lockdowns just last monday eight days ago they ran a full page article in the
[03:07:40.400 --> 03:07:45.840]  in the washington post we covered it saying man libertarians and and nationalists and conservatives
[03:07:45.840 --> 03:07:49.360]  won't let us have new lockdowns we need new lockdowns on a routine basis
[03:07:50.480 --> 03:07:55.440]  communist china just came out and said we want new lockdowns for the flu plus it's good you
[03:07:55.440 --> 03:08:00.800]  should not be in your house uh you know or outside your house at night time anyways and
[03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:05.440]  you should be locked in your house a couple you know weeks out of the month it's all a raw
[03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:12.240]  exercise of total power here's one of the news of australia outrage your proposal to lock down for
[03:08:12.240 --> 03:08:20.000]  the flu and it goes on to describe how china wants to lock down 13 million people in a city
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:27.440]  for a flu pandemic so all this is is a giant power grab here's another one doctors are baffled
[03:08:27.440 --> 03:08:33.600]  with a 70 year old girl summer's chronic arrest followed a cheer competition well i mean we we
[03:08:33.600 --> 03:08:41.360]  know what's going on so that's where we are is the normalization of tyranny but just what i said last
[03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:47.360]  hour with doug hagman the whole system's coming down the question is will we get crushed in the
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:52.240]  process and i'm so glad jerald's here because you know he's a best-selling author researcher was a
[03:08:52.240 --> 03:08:56.800]  big corporate advisor big lobbyist what he's really known for is predicting the markets and he's been
[03:08:56.800 --> 03:09:01.920]  predicting this just in this year's you know latest trends that they put out in december and
[03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:07.520]  january he predicted what's now happening with the banks you raise interest rates with with with
[03:09:07.520 --> 03:09:11.680]  all this free spending that's going on the quantitative easing for 15 years it's going to do this
[03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:18.800]  so here we are and we're in a dan review dan we don't scenario because if they don't it causes
[03:09:18.800 --> 03:09:23.440]  massive inflation so can't wait to hear what jerald has to say when i get off here in about three
[03:09:23.440 --> 03:09:28.800]  minutes and go eat some lunch and then and they get ready to continue working here at the office
[03:09:28.800 --> 03:09:33.920]  but i wanted to play this clip out of australia this isn't put out under some secret video this is
[03:09:33.920 --> 03:09:40.160]  put out by the australian government as a recruiting tool not to go fight china not to go fight some
[03:09:40.160 --> 03:09:46.400]  other country but to fight your own people now not even china puts out army recruiting ads
[03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:54.000]  to fight their own people it's all about fight america but this is the final stage of hey our
[03:09:54.000 --> 03:10:01.920]  domestic population is the enemy here it is third battalion the royal australian regiment
[03:10:05.680 --> 03:10:10.800]  get on there right for radio listeners bunch of us armored marines
[03:10:10.800 --> 03:10:23.200]  domestic army marching forward to fight their own people not shoot down hypersonic missiles
[03:10:23.200 --> 03:10:31.440]  not stop a chinese invasion but police dogs
[03:10:31.440 --> 03:10:41.040]  they say you get ready to fight realistic enemies
[03:10:44.800 --> 03:10:46.240]  and then they let them fight a
[03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:54.160]  group they can easily defeat to train them that this is your new enemies like to train the dog to
[03:10:54.160 --> 03:10:59.760]  attack people they're training the australian military to attack their own population yeah
[03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:03.360]  maintaining stability putting under the new world order
[03:11:17.760 --> 03:11:23.200]  that's the army australian army outrage is the australian army releases a chilling recruitment
[03:11:23.200 --> 03:11:26.800]  ad to insult us attacking civilians rather than foreign enemies now let me be very clear
[03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:30.640]  here i don't want any offensive attacks we lose if we do that up front
[03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:35.280]  they start a full blown war just like 1776 when they were marching on bunker hill
[03:11:35.280 --> 03:11:38.640]  and the captain of the militia said we don't look for a war but if they shoot first they're
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:43.200]  going to get one here today i want to just tell young people trying to join the military
[03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:46.400]  to be part of the new world order if that's what you want to be like that famous army clip from

[03:20:45.600 --> 03:20:52.880]  doug hagman and alex are just talking about again covid 19 is a police state virus and now
[03:20:52.880 --> 03:20:58.880]  what we're seeing is more and more the police state taking over again we forecast all this
[03:20:58.880 --> 03:21:06.000]  in our trends journal it's trendsjournal.com it's a grand total of like two dollars and 85 cents a
[03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:14.000]  week you know it's like a lousy cup of coffee in a joint you know i can't drink that stuff but anyway
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:21.440]  you know it's nothing and this week's is over 170 pages no ads so nobody tells us what to say we
[03:21:21.440 --> 03:21:25.360]  say what we say they're just like info wars you know they have their products that they're selling
[03:21:25.360 --> 03:21:32.000]  their products they're not somebody else you know they're doing what they can to give you the best
[03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:38.800]  they can so going back to our our trend forecasts you know we we were the first to come out with the
[03:21:38.800 --> 03:21:49.920]  covid war and you could go back to our magazine on january 28th 2020 the headline was coronavirus 106
[03:21:49.920 --> 03:21:56.560]  dead in china the next line was 1.4 billion still alive what are you telling me this crap for
[03:21:56.560 --> 03:22:03.360]  i'm mentioning this because in trend forecasting all things are connected so when you're looking at
[03:22:03.360 --> 03:22:07.920]  the covid war and then looking at what alex is talking about what's going on in australia this
[03:22:07.920 --> 03:22:14.640]  is all connected because what we said when this thing happened is covid war and they're calling
[03:22:14.640 --> 03:22:20.560]  it a pandemic it's not a pandemic again how many people do you know do you know personally
[03:22:20.560 --> 03:22:30.000]  that died from the coronavirus question number two how many of those people were elderly because
[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:34.240]  you know you're never going to die you know the average was that i think the average age in america
[03:22:34.240 --> 03:22:44.160]  is about uh 78 years old or something like that so now how many people you know that were elderly or
[03:22:44.160 --> 03:22:55.840]  or suffering from pre-existing comorbidities that killed them and not covid so it wasn't a pandemic
[03:22:56.640 --> 03:23:01.360]  and i'm mentioning this because all things are connected because this has a lot to do what's
[03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:14.400]  going on now in the bank stirb is going bust and this is not news to transjournal subscribers
[03:23:14.400 --> 03:23:22.240]  i've been saying on the air now since february and in the magazine since february watch out
[03:23:22.240 --> 03:23:33.760]  watch out from march economic madness we had forecast this we were the first ones
[03:23:35.520 --> 03:23:41.840]  it's one of the ways i made my name i was the first guy to come out with calling the um
[03:23:41.840 --> 03:23:52.160]  um crash of 1987 welstree journal did an article on it those days used to send out press releases
[03:23:53.520 --> 03:24:01.360]  and we sent out like 5 000 press releases in january of 1987 the year it will all collapse
[03:24:01.360 --> 03:24:10.240]  in our trends journal magazine in october 1999
[03:24:14.240 --> 03:24:26.240]  dot com bust we said it would bust by the second quarter of 2000 and bust it did now i'm going
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:32.880]  to go back because again all things are connected in trend forecasting about what alex was talking
[03:24:32.880 --> 03:24:39.840]  about the little military midgets you're all little military midgets to fight the people
[03:24:39.840 --> 03:24:47.440]  you're a little scum to fight the people who want freedom peace and justice so going back to that
[03:24:47.440 --> 03:24:55.360]  as i forecast when they launched the covet war they're going to destroy the lives and livelihoods
[03:24:56.800 --> 03:25:05.120]  of billions of people across the planet now so now when people lose everything and have
[03:25:05.120 --> 03:25:13.680]  nothing left to lose they lose it and they're taking to the streets and now the little clowns
[03:25:13.680 --> 03:25:22.080]  it wasn't a pandemic it was a political police state overtake you got arrogant little boys
[03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:30.720]  like gavin gruesome newsome closed down everywhere go in your house you can't go to the beach oh we

[03:49:13.200 --> 03:49:28.640]  the 20 banks that are sitting on huge potential security losses as was svb this is from market watch
[03:49:28.640 --> 03:49:36.480]  again this is old news and you go to jones trends.com and you take out a trends journal
[03:49:37.120 --> 03:49:43.600]  and you get a good deal and so we're doing everything we can give you the best we can
[03:49:45.600 --> 03:49:52.320]  the silicon valley bank fallouts start to spread across the world
[03:49:52.320 --> 03:49:59.680]  oh where'd that come from for the jerusalem post inside the silicon valley bank failure
[03:50:00.320 --> 03:50:05.040]  a tech industry in shock as it awaits a government response
[03:50:08.400 --> 03:50:16.560]  one after another this thing is serious the banks through bandits part is only one little
[03:50:16.560 --> 03:50:27.360]  element of it now let's look at the bigger picture the fed was going to raise interest rates
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:34.960]  about two weeks ago the guests on the street was that they would raise them 50 basis points
[03:50:34.960 --> 03:50:45.920]  and then it went down to 25 basis points
[03:50:47.360 --> 03:50:51.760]  and now is a question of whether or not they're going to raise them at all
[03:50:52.880 --> 03:50:59.440]  so here's the deal this is the trend forecast if they don't raise them at all
[03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:10.960]  all gold prices will skyrocket as we said they would and just before I took the break over here
[03:51:11.680 --> 03:51:13.760]  gold is up $50 today
[03:51:17.280 --> 03:51:22.160]  it's up over $80 since friday an ounce
[03:51:22.160 --> 03:51:32.960]  we said this was going to happen regardless of what the banksters do because the game is over
[03:51:35.360 --> 03:51:41.920]  if they raise interest rates 25 basis points gold will still go up
[03:51:41.920 --> 03:51:47.840]  and the economy will go down
[03:51:50.160 --> 03:51:55.040]  it takes a while before the high interest rate impact hits the economy
[03:51:55.920 --> 03:52:00.720]  so when you see numbers coming out that you know the GDP rose no no that this is phony stuff
[03:52:01.440 --> 03:52:06.480]  the the the increasing interest rates take several months before they they do the damage
[03:52:06.480 --> 03:52:10.560]  so in going back to gold
[03:52:13.600 --> 03:52:20.880]  you know it it's it's been flying high now it's above $1,900 an ounce
[03:52:23.680 --> 03:52:31.680]  we forecast that this year gold could well go well above $2,100 an ounce
[03:52:31.680 --> 03:52:40.480]  the globe is on the cusp of a global depression as we had said
[03:52:41.200 --> 03:52:45.920]  this will not be stagflation it will be dragflation
[03:52:47.920 --> 03:52:51.120]  the economy being dragged down as inflation goes up
[03:52:52.480 --> 03:52:57.680]  so now let's go back to the Fed what the Fed does is going to affect a lot of the world
[03:52:57.680 --> 03:53:04.960]  if they raise interest rates 50 basis points it's a collapse in front of your eyes like that
[03:53:06.960 --> 03:53:10.160]  all of these foreign nations which they call emerging markets
[03:53:11.440 --> 03:53:16.000]  they got a lot of dough borrowed in dollars so the stronger the dollar goes
[03:53:17.280 --> 03:53:20.320]  the lower their currencies go and the more dough they have to pay
[03:53:21.280 --> 03:53:26.320]  for their debt that's why you're seeing by the way protests taking place all around the world
[03:53:26.320 --> 03:53:30.240]  as people are taking to the streets because the lack of basic living standards
[03:53:30.960 --> 03:53:35.760]  government corruption crime and violence this is going to continue to escalate oh by the way
[03:53:36.480 --> 03:53:40.480]  all things are connected if you lived in one of these countries
[03:53:41.840 --> 03:53:46.640]  and things are going berserk that you think you want to get out oh then I forgot the Ukraine war
[03:53:47.280 --> 03:53:50.320]  oh yeah keep heating that up you get more and more of a refugee problem
[03:53:50.320 --> 03:53:55.040]  this thing is very serious
[03:53:58.000 --> 03:54:00.640]  so when you start putting all the fundamentals together
[03:54:04.480 --> 03:54:10.560]  this thing is going to go down big and hard and to me I don't give we do not give financial advice
[03:54:11.120 --> 03:54:16.080]  gold is the number one safe haven asset silver we rank as number two
[03:54:16.080 --> 03:54:22.320]  and we've been saying about playing the bitcoin bet even with things going down
[03:54:23.120 --> 03:54:28.080]  the cryptocurrency is pretty solid even though some of these other banks you know
[03:54:28.080 --> 03:54:33.840]  banks took deals we had you know crypto alliances with people looking for an alternative
[03:54:34.560 --> 03:54:39.600]  out of the crummy currencies that are worth nothing printed on nothing and backed by nothing
[03:54:39.600 --> 03:54:44.800]  so that's what you would say again you know to us
[03:54:47.120 --> 03:54:53.360]  gold is the number one safe haven asset and silver comes in number two silver two silver
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:55:02.160]  this is very important about silver when you have a gold why I say gold chain or a gold ring
[03:55:04.720 --> 03:55:08.960]  you don't throw it away when you're finished with it but you throw your cell phone away your
[03:55:08.960 --> 03:55:15.360]  computer whatever and that has silver in it the world is with this climate change they said like
[03:55:15.360 --> 03:55:20.000]  it or not they go in green there's a lot of silver in these solar panels and other things
[03:55:21.760 --> 03:55:26.240]  but once the silver once they throw the panels away the computers away they don't save it like
[03:55:26.240 --> 03:55:33.120]  they save gold they don't pile it up it's in the garbage it's in the dump there's going to be a
[03:55:33.120 --> 03:55:44.480]  shortage of silver at some point and it's also considered a currency so gold and silver and
[03:55:44.480 --> 03:55:51.840]  then if you want to gamble you played a bitcoin game and as we said if bitcoin breaks strongly
[03:55:51.840 --> 03:56:02.080]  above 25 000 a coin it could go another 25 k if it goes below 15 you looking for danger levels
[03:56:02.080 --> 03:56:09.200]  that's the hour forecast so going back to the economy the fed heads are going to meet
[03:56:11.520 --> 03:56:18.240]  next week and they're going to decide how much to raise interest rates this bank scare
[03:56:20.320 --> 03:56:25.840]  has put them on a downward trend so if they don't raise interest rates if they raise them
[03:56:25.840 --> 03:56:33.760]  only 25 basis points their inflation scam is going to continue it'll also slow down the economy
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:36.240]  and it'll be bullish for precious metals
[03:56:38.560 --> 03:56:47.840]  if they don't raise them at all gold skyrockets if they raise them 50 basis points economy crashes
[03:56:47.840 --> 03:56:56.080]  equity markets crash and gold prices go up because it's the ultimate safe haven asset
[03:56:56.080 --> 03:57:03.040]  the bank blow-ups right now this is only a tiny little part of the bigger picture
[03:57:04.320 --> 03:57:08.400]  as i said his interest rates go up you have a 31 trillion dollar debt in america
[03:57:08.960 --> 03:57:16.240]  31.7 you got to pay more in your interest and that goes across the board and around the world
