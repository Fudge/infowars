[01:19.280 --> 01:22.320]  into what happened in India and Pakistan two and a half weeks ago with the

[01:50.800 --> 01:55.280]  folks that call in because it brings up different angles different ideas
[01:55.280 --> 02:00.000]  different perspectives that I would have never thought of or in the heat of the
[02:00.000 --> 02:03.560]  radio show that I wouldn't have gotten to so we always enjoy spinning the wheel
[02:03.560 --> 02:08.440]  of fortune and taking your phone calls here on air for Tex Mars and Gerald
[02:08.440 --> 02:13.760]  Salente coming up today I've been aware of this for about a year and it's really
[02:13.760 --> 02:16.680]  concerned me and we've mentioned it a few times but I do want to spend a little
[02:16.680 --> 02:21.440]  bit of time on it today science daily reports boundary between Earth's upper
[02:21.440 --> 02:27.400]  atmosphere and space has moved to extraordinarily low altitudes NASA
[02:27.400 --> 02:34.080]  instruments show and I don't just believe NASA other private meteorological
[02:34.080 --> 02:40.320]  scientific institutions have reported at the same situation how does this tie
[02:40.320 --> 02:43.920]  into the chemtrails Paul Watson's doing an article on this today I'm going to
[02:43.920 --> 02:48.400]  break that down after the break and we've talked a lot about the Army War
[02:48.400 --> 02:51.840]  College the Defense Department the Pentagon openly saying that they're
[02:51.840 --> 02:54.760]  going to wage war on the American people that they're going to pull troops out of
[02:54.760 --> 02:59.040]  South Korea out of Iraq out of other places that are battle-hardened and
[02:59.040 --> 03:04.320]  particular from Iraq and close of a train to run checkpoints and go door to
[03:04.320 --> 03:09.240]  door confiscating firearms sometimes one unit may search over a hundred homes
[03:09.240 --> 03:15.400]  and one day very very very very brutal work and classical tyranny it being
[03:15.400 --> 03:19.520]  pointed at the American people but I had seen this article that Curt Nimmel
[03:19.520 --> 03:23.120]  emailed me yesterday out of the Phoenix Business Journal Arizona police say
[03:23.120 --> 03:26.960]  they're prepared as war college warrants military must prepare for unrest IMF
[03:26.960 --> 03:31.200]  warrants of economic riots but I only read the first few paragraphs yesterday
[03:31.200 --> 03:34.560]  on air I hadn't read the whole story last night I read it and there is a
[03:34.560 --> 03:43.920]  chilling nugget in here from the Arizona police from the Tucson police from the
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.480]  Phoenix police and others and that is that they have been secretly training
[03:49.480 --> 03:57.040]  now we already knew this but now it's admitted secretly training for years
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.200]  with Homeland Security to suppress the American people now when Bill Clinton
[04:02.200 --> 04:06.080]  first proposed Homeland Security in 93 it was proposed to engage in gun
[04:06.080 --> 04:12.680]  confiscation even set on MTV going into the housing prod projects and doing
[04:12.680 --> 04:16.600]  gun confiscations and quote things like that so they've been quietly building
[04:16.600 --> 04:19.880]  this up that's why they train the army the Marines they put them through these
[04:19.880 --> 04:23.320]  urban warfare drills to condition them and prepare them then they do urban
[04:23.320 --> 04:25.840]  warfare drills in major cities to condition the public and the police
[04:25.840 --> 04:29.960]  this is a long acclamation and now they admit they've been acclimating us so I
[04:29.960 --> 04:34.720]  want to go over that report as well before Gerald Salente joins us I've got
[04:34.720 --> 04:38.720]  a hurry also a Chrysler says they're gonna shut down all production for a
[04:38.720 --> 04:46.920]  month Reuters maybe longer a girl who gave two classmates Hall's cough drops is
[04:46.920 --> 04:51.640]  facing criminal charges right now they're considering criminal charges and
[04:51.640 --> 04:56.760]  Governor Bogovitch got his start as a bookie in a paid Chicago model of course
[04:56.760 --> 05:02.400]  he did hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's
[05:02.400 --> 05:05.760]  important to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we
[05:05.760 --> 05:09.480]  need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand
[05:09.480 --> 05:12.600]  in a red line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the
[05:12.600 --> 05:16.800]  Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:16.800 --> 05:20.320]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:20.320 --> 05:24.280]  for special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the
[05:24.280 --> 05:29.120]  telephones and email they voted to print $850 billion at least out of thin air
[05:29.120 --> 05:33.400]  this money now owns the American and European banks the exploding inflation
[05:33.400 --> 05:37.240]  that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the
[05:37.240 --> 05:41.400]  cost of assassins particularly food beyond many Americans reach in
[05:41.400 --> 05:45.560]  pre-Nazi Germany superinflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two
[05:45.560 --> 05:50.080]  days until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so
[05:50.080 --> 05:54.360]  fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging
[05:54.360 --> 05:57.680]  with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock
[05:57.680 --> 06:01.560]  their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business
[06:01.560 --> 06:05.680]  whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is
[06:05.680 --> 06:09.640]  zeroing in on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying food and
[06:09.640 --> 06:13.640]  paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get
[06:13.640 --> 06:17.280]  self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very important
[06:17.280 --> 06:20.640]  to understand that by having a supply of storeable food the government the new
[06:20.640 --> 06:24.640]  old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[06:24.640 --> 06:28.360]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in
[06:28.360 --> 06:32.200]  the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[06:32.200 --> 06:35.960]  storeable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or

[07:21.800 --> 07:26.600]  I want to get into this first so that I don't run out of time and not cover it
[07:26.600 --> 07:32.160]  I'm gonna go back over to Texmars coming up a few hours in studio the Phoenix
[07:32.160 --> 07:36.200]  Business Journal Arizona police say they are prepared as war college warns
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.040]  military must prep for unrest IMF warrants of economic riots and the whole
[07:41.040 --> 07:48.120]  article is written by Mike Sonix to sell you on the idea that this is okay this
[07:48.120 --> 07:53.120]  is good this is a wonderful thing to have troops on the streets of America a
[07:53.120 --> 07:57.760]  new report by the US Army War College talks about the possibility of Pentagon
[07:57.760 --> 08:02.280]  resources and troops being used should the economic crisis lead to civil
[08:02.280 --> 08:07.920]  unrest such as protest against business and governments or runs on beleaguered
[08:07.920 --> 08:12.640]  banks the poor bankers I want to steal your money and have already stolen most
[08:12.640 --> 08:18.360]  of your pension funds over 50% of the value the beleaguered see oh they're
[08:18.360 --> 08:23.920]  the good guys and the people are the bad guys that's how that paragraphs written
[08:23.920 --> 08:28.800]  the army just suddenly has this plan they suddenly are worried they've just
[08:28.800 --> 08:32.760]  been gearing up forever with the private banks that own our government
[08:32.760 --> 08:37.520]  criminally to take over I mean this just happens over and over again from Rome to
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.960]  Germany to China to Russia to third world countries every week it's just
[08:41.960 --> 08:45.240]  always the greatest danger of a tyrannical government using the military
[08:45.240 --> 08:49.400]  to take over but there's nothing set about that it's just all they just now
[08:49.400 --> 08:55.960]  got this idea no they've been training in secret for decades we've gone and
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.920]  videotaped it at great risk ladies and gentlemen remember once in Florida we
[09:00.920 --> 09:03.720]  were covering the military doing takeover drills they went around in the
[09:03.720 --> 09:07.280]  neighborhood saying don't talk to Alex Jones he's crazy before they did the
[09:07.280 --> 09:11.920]  drills and then they've somebody broken our hotel room and stole 800 bucks we
[09:11.920 --> 09:18.160]  had for the trip you know stuff like that cars following us around I don't know
[09:18.160 --> 09:23.760]  why we ran because we were in the woods videotaping their drills the railroad
[09:23.760 --> 09:27.120]  track area said no trespassing so we weren't going on the railroad track then
[09:27.120 --> 09:30.720]  we had these guys on dune buggies and locals witnessed it we also interview
[09:30.720 --> 09:36.080]  them chasing us through the woods at night and I don't know why we ran I just
[09:36.080 --> 09:39.240]  I didn't want to take my footage I guess because they'd already taken our
[09:39.240 --> 09:43.200]  footage in San Antonio one time at gunpoint and that ended up in World
[09:43.200 --> 09:47.920]  Net Daily but anyways widespread civil violence inside the United States
[09:47.920 --> 09:53.480]  would force would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities and
[09:53.480 --> 09:57.560]  extremes to defend basic domestic order and human security said the war college
[09:57.560 --> 10:00.760]  report and the report goes on to say engaging the American people
[10:00.760 --> 10:05.280]  engaging resistance and that's in the John Warren defense authorization act
[10:05.280 --> 10:11.760]  it's I mean it's in all these official battle funding two years ago but they're
[10:11.760 --> 10:15.800]  just now telling the public that oh this is something new because of the
[10:15.800 --> 10:20.600]  economic downturn the economic downturn has been triggered by design and the
[10:20.600 --> 10:24.240]  military is there as a vanguard to make sure the legitimate government the
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.520]  states the governors and the legislatures and the Congress aren't able to
[10:29.520 --> 10:33.280]  bring the criminals in the executive whether it's Obama or Bush they both
[10:33.280 --> 10:37.080]  work for the same people on record Obama's the biggest cheerleader for the
[10:37.080 --> 10:41.960]  banker takeover it's to make sure that Congress doesn't follow the Constitution
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.040]  and arrest these criminals that's why you have Congress being threatened with
[10:46.040 --> 10:50.280]  martial law repeatedly on record with two different congressmen and one
[10:50.280 --> 10:53.720]  senator on record saying they were threatened with martial law by the way
[10:53.720 --> 10:57.840]  that's in this article too but they spin it and say well you know Congress was
[10:57.840 --> 11:01.920]  told that that if the martial law may have to be declared if they didn't do the
[11:01.920 --> 11:06.880]  banker bill no it was you do this or we'll just overthrow you I mean this is
[11:06.880 --> 11:10.760]  a coup ladies and gentlemen the coup has succeeded and now they're stealing your
[11:10.760 --> 11:14.480]  pension funds do you understand I kept telling you years ago this was the plan
[11:14.480 --> 11:20.560]  this the study says economic collapse terrorism and loss of legal order are
[11:20.560 --> 11:23.920]  among possible domestic shocks that might require military action in the US
[11:23.920 --> 11:28.440]  well why is their loss of order because you've come in and destroyed the economy
[11:28.440 --> 11:32.960]  you've come in and cut off liquidity the economy so you can consolidate it the
[11:32.960 --> 11:37.840]  international monetary fund managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.440]  Wednesday of economy related riots and unrest in various global markets in the
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.320]  financial crisis is not addressed and lower-income households are hurt by
[11:47.320 --> 11:51.560]  credit constraints and rising unemployment US Senator James Inhofe
[11:51.560 --> 11:54.960]  Republican Oklahoma and US representative Brad Sherman that all broke
[11:54.960 --> 11:58.920]  here folks Democrat California both said the US Treasury Secretary Henry
[11:58.920 --> 12:03.600]  Paulson brought up a worst-case scenario as he pushed for the Wall Street bailout
[12:03.600 --> 12:06.920]  in September no he said you do this or we'll just do it without you
[12:06.920 --> 12:12.200]  Paulson's former Goldman Sachs CEO said that might even require a declaration of
[12:12.200 --> 12:17.600]  martial law the two noted and under the PDD 51 martial law that we've been under
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.160]  for over a year it says Congress isn't involved in the continuity government
[12:21.160 --> 12:24.800]  governors aren't involved only the president the National Security Council
[12:24.800 --> 12:30.880]  FEMA and Homeland Security and now when you see FEMA on TV it's generals and now
[12:30.880 --> 12:34.800]  when you see other federal department directors of non-military it's generals
[12:34.800 --> 12:38.640]  it's admirals they're taking over everything the major universities are
[12:38.640 --> 12:42.720]  predominantly run by former generals and admirals in some cases in uniform now
[12:42.720 --> 12:49.760]  this is military government it isn't common we're in it martial law is when
[12:49.760 --> 12:54.280]  the normal civil government is abolished and due process is abolished and then
[12:54.280 --> 12:58.720]  there's different degrees of it people think of physical martial laws troops
[12:58.720 --> 13:02.200]  all over the streets and secret arrest and burning buildings that is on a
[13:02.200 --> 13:09.640]  scale of 1 to 10 a number 10 we're now at about six and a half a seven and so
[13:09.640 --> 13:12.680]  you're starting to see troops at checkpoints troops at DWI checkpoints
[13:12.680 --> 13:17.440]  to condition troops at car wrecks quote helping for PR purposes to acclimate
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.960]  the population state and local police in Arizona say they have broad plans to
[13:22.960 --> 13:26.520]  deal with social unrest including trouble resulting from economic distress the
[13:26.520 --> 13:30.480]  security and police agencies declined to give specifics but said they would
[13:30.480 --> 13:34.440]  employ existing and generalized emergency response to civil unrest and
[13:34.440 --> 13:38.360]  race for any reason the Phoenix Police Department is not expecting any civil
[13:38.360 --> 13:42.440]  unrest at this time but we always train to prepare for civil unrest and those
[13:42.440 --> 13:45.960]  issues we have a tactical response unit that trains continually and has
[13:45.960 --> 13:49.600]  deployed on many occasions for any potential civil unrest issue said
[13:49.600 --> 13:55.720]  Phoenix police spokesman Andy Hill now here's the key we have well established
[13:55.720 --> 14:00.520]  plans in place for civil unrest said Scottsdale police spokesman Mark Clark
[14:00.520 --> 14:06.240]  Clark Hill and other police officials said the region did plenty of planning
[14:06.240 --> 14:10.960]  and emergency management training for the Super Bowl in February and Glendale
[14:10.960 --> 14:17.240]  we're prepared said Maricopa County Sheriff's Deputy Chief Dave Trombie
[14:17.240 --> 14:21.960]  citing his office's past dealings with immigration marches and major events
[14:21.960 --> 14:26.680]  then it goes on to say they've been working with Homeland Security to deal
[14:26.680 --> 14:30.840]  with the American people nothing to do with terrorism folks get that straight
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.800]  the whole battle plan the training the entire makeup and then their own
[14:34.800 --> 14:39.280]  directives say it's for the American people Super Bowl security efforts
[14:39.280 --> 14:42.760]  included personnel and resources from the US Department of Homeland Security and
[14:42.760 --> 14:46.200]  US Military Northern Command that's what's in control the real capital there
[14:46.200 --> 14:49.680]  in Colorado Springs which coordinated with Arizona officials the Northern
[14:49.680 --> 14:53.400]  Command was created after 9-11 to have troops in Defense Department resources
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.720]  ready to respond to security problems terrorism and natural disasters so see
[14:57.720 --> 15:01.200]  they use every big event to train the public with troops and military all
[15:01.200 --> 15:07.120]  merged and it goes on to talk about Northern Command basically running the
[15:07.120 --> 15:10.080]  country you can go read the rest of the article we have it linked up on info
[15:10.080 --> 15:16.280]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com it's very simple elites want to dominate

[15:45.920 --> 15:53.440]  control of your life now what happened to Serbia Serbia love them or hate them
[15:53.440 --> 15:57.200]  was encircled by the Croats and the Muslims who were continually attacking
[15:57.200 --> 16:03.120]  them with NATO and US funding they had Muslim extremists attack the nation
[16:03.120 --> 16:07.520]  repeatedly for two years the Serbs finally fought back NATO came in blew the
[16:07.520 --> 16:10.880]  country to bits bombed all their bridges and major infrastructure power plants
[16:10.880 --> 16:15.880]  water treatment TV stations because they were producing aircraft cars they
[16:15.880 --> 16:21.720]  were first world they were becoming a destination for tourists that was
[16:21.720 --> 16:25.600]  rivaling many other areas of Western Europe they had to be destroyed and the
[16:25.600 --> 16:29.360]  NATO documents have come out that it was about destroying any independent group
[16:29.360 --> 16:34.520]  that didn't have private globalist central banks in control Serbia wouldn't
[16:34.520 --> 16:38.240]  take a central bank owned by the Bank of England basically that's who owns it
[16:38.240 --> 16:43.720]  all who controls it same thing happened with Afghanistan a rogue country they
[16:43.720 --> 16:48.840]  didn't control the head control of the opium they went in there same thing
[16:48.840 --> 16:54.840]  happened in Iraq first world nation investments under another US earlier US
[16:54.840 --> 17:00.200]  policy from the 50s for stabilization they go in they fund Saddam to attack
[17:00.200 --> 17:03.760]  the Iranians when they're done with him they set him up tell him to invade
[17:03.760 --> 17:07.600]  Kuwait on record he invades they set him up 18 years later three million
[17:07.600 --> 17:11.320]  Iraqis are dead a million and a half in the last five and a half years total
[17:11.320 --> 17:19.200]  siege their crop production is down by over 80% of what it was pre Gulf War
[17:19.200 --> 17:25.720]  only GMO foods are allowed to be planted under law in Iraq the public's being
[17:25.720 --> 17:29.640]  forcibly inoculated if they want quote welfare checks that's all they can live
[17:29.640 --> 17:35.000]  off of huge social engineering and they've done this in country after
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.600]  country Iceland they're now doing it in Argentina imploding them by design they
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.000]  went from first world nation to third world nation within weeks in 2000 and
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.360]  it only gets worse and we have the IMF and World Bank documents they
[17:48.360 --> 17:52.800]  engineered all of that why am I mentioning this the same things being
[17:52.800 --> 17:57.240]  done here we are the wealthiest strongest most powerful country we've been
[17:57.240 --> 18:01.240]  sucked into the new world order we've been used by the new world order and now
[18:01.240 --> 18:06.000]  ladies and gentlemen they are done with us all the evils of the globalist system
[18:06.000 --> 18:09.520]  are being blamed on America's they go into the next phase all the tyranny
[18:09.520 --> 18:13.360]  the torture the corruption the wars the international banks get the oil the
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.640]  resources of Iraq and other nations the opium of Afghanistan the control of
[18:17.640 --> 18:25.000]  Kosovo we pay the bill and so now they're done with us and just as any other
[18:25.000 --> 18:30.040]  sovereign nation that has sovereign independent wealthy middle classes must
[18:30.040 --> 18:35.600]  be destroyed and we are now being destroyed and they have prepared for
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.400]  decades for what they are now doing and the poor troops and I got to say poor
[18:39.400 --> 18:43.000]  troops because I most of them are against shooting at U.S. citizens they
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.720]  have no idea what's happening they're gonna see the riots this will then set
[18:48.720 --> 18:51.960]  the precedent for using troops in the United States and then we'll have
[18:51.960 --> 18:55.520]  troops on the streets forever and then the secret arrest and the rest of it
[18:55.520 --> 19:01.240]  will begin a few years after that this is what we face we are being brought into

[24:06.280 --> 24:13.680]  moguls to set up hundreds of new environmental taxes that have nothing to

[25:10.920 --> 25:13.760]  Renaissance man we'll discuss this with Texas I'm almost out of time before
[25:13.760 --> 25:17.920]  Gerald Salente joins us science a daily boundary between Earth's upper
[25:17.920 --> 25:22.480]  atmosphere and space has moved extraordinarily low altitudes NASA
[25:22.480 --> 25:27.680]  instruments document and other independent groups are also documenting
[25:27.680 --> 25:30.840]  this observations made by NASA instruments on board an Air Force
[25:30.840 --> 25:34.240]  satellite have shown that the boundary between the Earth's upper atmosphere and
[25:34.240 --> 25:38.880]  space has moved extraordinarily low altitudes these observations were made
[25:38.880 --> 25:47.760]  by the couple ion natural dynamics investigation instrument suite which was
[25:47.760 --> 25:51.880]  launched aboard the U.S. Air Force's communications navigation outage
[25:51.880 --> 25:59.680]  forecast system satellite on April 16 2008 the CINDI suite which was built
[25:59.680 --> 26:04.840]  under the direction of the principal investigator Rod Healus of the
[26:04.840 --> 26:10.280]  University of Texas at Dallas includes both an ion and natural sensors and
[26:10.280 --> 26:18.360]  makes measurements of the variations in neutral and ion densities and drifts the
[26:18.360 --> 26:24.040]  discovery however that the ionosphere was not where it had been expected to be
[26:24.040 --> 26:28.640]  during the first months of the CINDI operations the transition between the
[26:28.640 --> 26:34.320]  ionosphere and space was found to be at about 260 miles above the earth altitude
[26:34.320 --> 26:38.600]  during the nighttime barely rising above 500 miles during the day these
[26:38.600 --> 26:41.920]  altitudes were extraordinarily low compared to the more typical values of
[26:41.920 --> 26:49.320]  400 miles during the nighttime at 600 miles during the day and it goes on to
[26:49.320 --> 26:55.200]  but where they talk about a 11-year solar cycle and when the Sun heats up it
[26:55.200 --> 26:59.240]  literally you know pumps in more ions in the atmosphere and that's a large part
[26:59.240 --> 27:08.240]  of cloud seating and cloud production and now that the Sun has basically
[27:08.240 --> 27:15.800]  cooled off they're saying it goes on the fact that the Sun has now has the
[27:15.800 --> 27:20.760]  least amount of Sunspot activity ever recorded and is and is ejecting less
[27:20.760 --> 27:27.960]  radiation in different forms of the light spectrum and a whole other field of
[27:27.960 --> 27:36.520]  other rays that the atmosphere itself is contracting this planet has a tiny
[27:36.520 --> 27:47.760]  ribbon of atmosphere around it only about 18 miles of it is even breathable
[27:47.760 --> 27:51.920]  for human beings and at that height you would get very sick and a lot of people
[27:51.920 --> 27:58.840]  would die but above 20,000 feet you are dead meat ladies and gentlemen very very
[27:58.840 --> 28:03.560]  quickly so we have an atmosphere covering this giant planetoid we live on
[28:03.560 --> 28:09.560]  cold earth called terra firma that is energized by the Sun and the Sun is
[28:09.560 --> 28:14.120]  cooling down right now in what they believe is part of its natural cycle
[28:14.120 --> 28:20.480]  and do you hear Obama saying you know we've got to tax people so that the Sun
[28:20.480 --> 28:28.520]  won't cool down no you hear him claiming that flatulence of cows and human
[28:28.520 --> 28:34.400]  respiration is causing this and it's just asinine ladies and gentlemen but
[28:34.400 --> 28:40.520]  later I want to tie this into dangerous things we know are going on by at least
[28:40.520 --> 28:46.640]  the US government manipulating the atmosphere worldwide that could be
[28:46.640 --> 28:53.080]  contributing to this because they admit they have very advanced weather weapons
[28:53.080 --> 28:59.320]  that are being employed against us of course we're on the March the Empire's

[32:58.640 --> 33:05.880]  forecast the future I have accurately forecasted the future on hundreds of
[33:05.880 --> 33:13.800]  occasions but somebody's been doing it a lot longer than I have and with
[33:13.800 --> 33:21.640]  amazing I'd say 95 plus percent accuracy is Gerald Salente now over a year ago
[33:21.640 --> 33:24.960]  the British Ministry of Defense basically forecasted everything they're
[33:24.960 --> 33:27.800]  doing right now and they admitted that they basically work for foreign offshore
[33:27.800 --> 33:32.640]  banks that it's a world government and that this is being done by design this
[33:32.640 --> 33:37.480]  year the military the Pentagon and the US put out a similar report but they know
[33:37.480 --> 33:40.640]  the general public is not reading these reports so a lot of this isn't even
[33:40.640 --> 33:45.600]  forecasting for myself it is going out and reading what the internal government
[33:45.600 --> 33:51.040]  documents are stating and if we do not face up to what's happening if we do
[33:51.040 --> 33:55.200]  not face up to what's unfolding it is only going to get worse now the
[33:55.200 --> 33:59.880]  military is is is broad paints with a broad brush when they talk about this
[33:59.880 --> 34:05.560]  Gerald Salente has been very specific that there would be worldwide riots
[34:05.560 --> 34:11.280]  starting and he said that about a year ago and now wallah we see it happening
[34:11.280 --> 34:15.760]  and now we see the IMF World Bank and others echoing this in the military
[34:15.760 --> 34:20.560]  saying that they are prepared to suppress the American people they also
[34:20.560 --> 34:23.440]  spin this in the media and say the Greeks are rioting because the police
[34:23.440 --> 34:28.760]  shot at 15 year old in the back but if you read the Greek websites the Greek
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.360]  news they're saying no everything's being privatized and that's not free
[34:33.360 --> 34:38.080]  market the roads the power plants the universities it's all being handed over
[34:38.080 --> 34:41.200]  to the IMF World Bank they're being looted they're being robbed they're
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.280]  losing all their jobs their their currency is being devalued the European
[34:47.280 --> 34:51.720]  Union is absorbing them and destroying them and just last week the Financial
[34:51.720 --> 34:55.720]  Times of London admitted that the new world order is anti-democratic and is
[34:55.720 --> 34:58.760]  tyrannical but said that's a good thing
[34:58.760 --> 35:03.760]  Evan Zandros Pritchard came out in the London Telegraph last Thursday and said
[35:03.760 --> 35:08.280]  that we're gonna see riots worldwide because of globalism and because it is
[35:08.280 --> 35:14.360]  tyrannical so here we have it it's it's unfolding but we're gonna get specific
[35:14.360 --> 35:19.920]  forecast the next hour and a half from Gerald Salente on what he specifically
[35:19.920 --> 35:23.040]  sees happening in the next month the next year the next two years the next
[35:23.040 --> 35:27.560]  three years and then some solutions how we prepare for it in his educated
[35:27.560 --> 35:32.880]  opinion you can go to his website trendsresearch.com and watch all the
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.120]  videos of him going back decades ago making accurate predictions years
[35:36.120 --> 35:42.960]  beforehand and of course CNN ABC Fox of all-coding you know the best predictor
[35:42.960 --> 35:48.920]  of future trends out there and so we're very very honored to have him on the
[35:48.920 --> 35:53.240]  show with us today mr. Salente it's good to have you back with us oh thanks so
[35:53.240 --> 35:57.880]  much for having me Alex you know what instead of Alex Jones throwing out a
[35:57.880 --> 36:01.340]  bunch of questions out of the gate what is most important to Gerald Salente
[36:01.340 --> 36:07.400]  right now one of the listeners need to know is coming up in the future according
[36:07.400 --> 36:13.080]  to your crystal ball well you really hit upon it it did we're going to see
[36:13.080 --> 36:18.440]  revolutions this whole system is falling apart there is no salvaging it
[36:18.440 --> 36:24.920]  when you look at the the steps that are being taken that we call it the Bernanke
[36:24.920 --> 36:29.280]  two-step after the Federal Reserve Chairman and that of course is either
[36:29.280 --> 36:33.880]  adjust interest rates which they've now adjusted to the point where they can't
[36:33.880 --> 36:41.440]  be adjusted anymore and or print more money and they've done both and neither
[36:41.440 --> 36:49.040]  of those two actions have stemmed the unraveling of the US economy or the
[36:49.040 --> 36:55.520]  world economy for that matter the governments the local state governments
[36:55.520 --> 36:58.400]  including of course the federal government as well they're only other
[36:58.400 --> 37:03.280]  solution that they're doing is they're squeezing the little people for more
[37:03.280 --> 37:07.560]  money back here in New York I'm sure it's making the national news as well
[37:07.560 --> 37:15.600]  they put taxes as much as 18% on soda pop 8% for a taxi ride they just
[37:15.600 --> 37:22.120]  increase the transit fares and in doing so they've decreased the amount of
[37:22.120 --> 37:27.400]  available subways cutting back on the buses they're even bringing in new
[37:27.400 --> 37:31.720]  subway cars now to really squeeze the little people just like they do in
[37:31.720 --> 37:37.880]  China they're taking out the seats so they could put push people in like cattle so
[37:37.880 --> 37:42.360]  we're going to see the little little people squeeze by the way is one of our
[37:42.360 --> 37:46.920]  top trends for 2009 well you were saying that a year ago now they've
[37:46.920 --> 37:52.040]  announced as you said 88 new taxes in New York State alone hundreds of other
[37:52.040 --> 37:56.280]  taxes all over the place the people just don't have the money to pay for all of
[37:56.280 --> 38:01.320]  this and so as the IMF and World Bank documents stated in late 2001 they want
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.800]  the people to riot so they can then bring in the army against them we've had
[38:05.800 --> 38:09.800]  decades of secret training by the military to take over the West now
[38:09.800 --> 38:13.120]  they're announcing from France to Germany to England to the United States to
[38:13.120 --> 38:18.160]  Canada that indeed you know it's in major papers martial law is good the
[38:18.160 --> 38:22.400]  troops will suppress you I mean this really is a financial coup we're
[38:22.400 --> 38:27.680]  witnessing can you speak to that well it's definitely a financial coup Wall
[38:27.680 --> 38:34.360]  Street is hijacked Washington in broad daylight and we now as we know of course
[38:34.360 --> 38:40.680]  you know the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is a Goldman Sachs man former
[38:40.680 --> 38:46.920]  CEO they're bringing in now Obama backtrack Obama we call him the man of
[38:46.920 --> 38:52.040]  change of course there's no change they're bringing in Timothy Geithner the
[38:52.040 --> 38:55.920]  Federal Reserve Chairman from the Federal Reserve President of the New York
[38:55.920 --> 38:59.880]  Federal the Federal Reserve Bank President of the New York Federal Reserve
[38:59.880 --> 39:04.920]  and you know they're just bringing the whole crew of Wall Street people running
[39:04.920 --> 39:10.160]  Washington so it's being done in broad daylight as well as these bailouts they
[39:10.160 --> 39:16.520]  may have all the plans in place and they may be very you know the the
[39:16.520 --> 39:22.920]  Illuminati so to speak may have their agenda laid out but when you see what's
[39:22.920 --> 39:29.680]  going on it has to be the Illuminati that's executing their plans because
[39:29.680 --> 39:34.440]  no matter what they do they're not going to be able to stop the amount of
[39:34.440 --> 39:40.000]  uprising that's going to pour forth you know I'm a Bronx boy originally and
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.680]  yeah you know what the city looks like and you know we have a saying here at
[39:46.680 --> 39:52.640]  the Trends Research Institute when people lose everything and they have
[39:52.640 --> 39:58.360]  nothing to lose they lose it and this is what these white shoe boys don't
[39:58.360 --> 40:03.040]  understand you know the Princeton Harvard Yale crowd you know that has had the
[40:03.040 --> 40:07.480]  silver spoon they're arrogant yuppies who think they're God and have disdain
[40:07.480 --> 40:12.080]  for everybody and they think it's cute they've stolen 8.5 trillion and that
[40:12.080 --> 40:15.640]  those numbers are two weeks old now folks it's over a trillion 300 billion
[40:15.640 --> 40:18.760]  they steal a week so it's over 10 trillion you watch the next week or two
[40:18.760 --> 40:23.480]  that number will come out but 8.5 trillion admittedly stolen and these
[40:23.480 --> 40:28.400]  arrogant yuppies these arrogant frat boys are telling Congress you don't get
[40:28.400 --> 40:32.160]  to know where the money went and we have the army standing by that's what
[40:32.160 --> 40:39.520]  Paulson told them I mean this is insane megalomaniacal hubris so so where is
[40:39.520 --> 40:44.200]  this going I mean is they just openly hijack everything steal everything and
[40:44.200 --> 40:49.080]  say we're going to squeeze you down to nothing exactly and what we're saying
[40:49.080 --> 40:54.760]  is it's going to be beyond their control this is the beginning of the
[40:54.760 --> 41:01.520]  second revolution and and it's going to be worldwide there's no stopping it so
[41:01.520 --> 41:07.600]  as the trends that we're looking at for 2009 the revolution is the third among
[41:07.600 --> 41:13.120]  them the first one is that's going to begin to precipitate this is the great
[41:13.120 --> 41:20.640]  collapse and as we as you well know in this exactly this time last year we
[41:20.640 --> 41:25.840]  came out with the panic of 08 we said Americans would wake up in 2008 and the
[41:25.840 --> 41:29.680]  financial markets would unravel there would be no stopping it now we're
[41:29.680 --> 41:36.360]  saying it's going to be the collapse of 09 and let me explain why in 2008 most of
[41:36.360 --> 41:40.000]  the focus of the media has been on the financial markets in the real estate
[41:40.000 --> 41:44.600]  markets of course they're intertwined now what we're going to see is the great
[41:44.600 --> 41:51.000]  retail crash come from a very very dismal Christmas as a result of that you're
[41:51.000 --> 41:56.200]  going to start seeing major chains going bankrupt after the Christmas holiday
[41:56.200 --> 42:01.760]  probably around January middle of January there's going to be some kind of a
[42:01.760 --> 42:06.800]  bit of euphoria because people are still hoping that their man of change will
[42:06.800 --> 42:11.200]  somehow miraculously bring about change and of course he said he was going to
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.720]  heal the nation and repair the world so Obama has great plans ahead and there
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.440]  are people that actually believe this stuff so we're going to wait till after
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.920]  the inauguration in June to a January 20th before the real pressure starts to
[42:25.920 --> 42:30.800]  to hit and when they find out that he is actually a bigger cheerleader than
[42:30.800 --> 42:36.280]  Bush for the banker takeover and that he is their man how long until the people
[42:36.280 --> 42:40.200]  become disillusioned with their new corporate savior well this is where
[42:40.200 --> 42:45.320]  we're going so now now February comes along things get really very cold and
[42:45.320 --> 42:50.480]  dismal and bleak we're going to start seeing as I said major retailers folding
[42:50.480 --> 42:56.720]  now let's think of what happens result we've already seen KB toys
[42:56.720 --> 43:03.360]  sharper image circuit city linens and things Steven Barry's go under it plus
[43:03.360 --> 43:06.680]  many more are you kidding half my favorite restaurants in Austin aren't
[43:06.680 --> 43:10.640]  there anymore they're not there anymore so now we're going to see major change
[43:10.640 --> 43:21.920]  start to fold who is going to rent these vacant spaces who nobody you're going
[43:21.920 --> 43:27.840]  to start seeing empty stores throughout malls throughout strip malls now let's
[43:27.840 --> 43:32.320]  bring it to another level and won't that further destroy confidence when people
[43:32.320 --> 43:37.680]  see the physical manifestation of a economy and cardiac arrest it precisely
[43:37.680 --> 43:43.480]  so the psychological the psychological impact is as great now let's move over
[43:43.480 --> 43:48.040]  to another sector of commercial we're already seeing the financial markets
[43:48.040 --> 43:54.560]  they've collapsed and empty buildings on and on and on people are being fired
[43:54.560 --> 44:00.000]  every day and we see the numbers what was Bank of America last week 52,000
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.600]  couple of weeks earlier city city group and I love it Bank of America they came
[44:05.600 --> 44:10.760]  out they said that these 52,000 would be fired over a three-year period yeah like
[44:10.760 --> 44:14.480]  they can look three years ahead of time they don't even they can't plan lunch
[44:14.480 --> 44:18.800]  you know so we get this straight these people are being fired right away the
[44:18.800 --> 44:23.840]  point being now you're going to have the next shoot of fall is going to be the
[44:23.840 --> 44:29.760]  commercial real estate sector which was leveraged far greater than the than the
[44:29.760 --> 44:35.280]  home real estate sector so now you're going to see the collapse the retail
[44:35.280 --> 44:41.520]  sector collapses commercial real estate collapses there is no body left to save
[44:41.520 --> 44:47.760]  anymore the crash keeps coming harder and harder and louder and louder so
[44:47.760 --> 44:53.120]  that's the second phase the third phase after the crash so first we had the
[44:53.120 --> 44:57.000]  panic then we had the collapse and now we're going to go into the greatest
[44:57.000 --> 45:01.360]  depression and it's going to be worse than the last depression although of
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.720]  course Bernanke and I was doing an interview and and the host said to me
[45:05.720 --> 45:10.440]  well well Fed Chairman Bernanke is a student of the of the Great Depression
[45:10.440 --> 45:16.100]  and he says there won't be one this time around and I say why would anybody
[45:16.100 --> 45:21.120]  believe anyone who hasn't predicted what was happening going to happen and has
[45:21.120 --> 45:25.840]  everything that they've said has come out false so why would anybody give any
[45:25.840 --> 45:29.440]  credence to this person that's right I happen to be watching Cavuto last night
[45:29.440 --> 45:35.720]  just briefly and he said the 15 Grand Puba financial experts he had on a year
[45:35.720 --> 45:40.300]  and a half ago said it was over we were going into green pastures everything was
[45:40.300 --> 45:44.360]  wonderful well what Cavuto won't tell you is those guys aren't stupid they're
[45:44.360 --> 45:48.720]  liars they've been busy positioning their money you know buying their private
[45:48.720 --> 45:52.840]  retreats in Dubai and Paraguay they've been busy getting their money off shore
[45:52.840 --> 45:57.480]  while they told the suckers to keep pumping their money in that's right
[45:57.480 --> 46:01.920]  and then that's what they do you know it's a suckers game these are Wall
[46:01.920 --> 46:07.720]  Street cons like Coney Island blockers so now what happens here's why it's
[46:07.720 --> 46:12.000]  going to be worse than the Great Great Depression and why we're calling it the
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.440]  greatest depression back in the 1930s most people didn't own homes so they
[46:17.440 --> 46:21.040]  weren't paying these mortgages they weren't paying insurance they weren't
[46:21.040 --> 46:26.320]  paying upkeep and all the other expenses it keeps the run a home number two there
[46:26.320 --> 46:30.960]  was no such thing as home equity loans matter of fact back then if somebody had
[46:30.960 --> 46:34.840]  what they called a second mortgage that meant that they were a loser and they
[46:34.840 --> 46:40.000]  needed money back then Americans didn't have credit cards they didn't exist so
[46:40.000 --> 46:46.720]  the people weren't $14 trillion in debt and back then we had a trade surplus we
[46:46.720 --> 46:51.800]  were not seven hundred billion dollars in the hole each year and we had budget
[46:51.800 --> 46:56.040]  surpluses what are we at this year two trillion one trillion a number keeps
[46:56.040 --> 47:00.000]  changing oh now the defense budgets over a trillion and not even counting the
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.320]  supplementals the Bush triple the size of government and and and all these other
[47:04.320 --> 47:09.000]  governments are just growing growing growing again don't they understand that
[47:09.000 --> 47:13.520]  they can only put so much weight on the donkey's back no they don't because
[47:13.520 --> 47:17.840]  they've never had difficult financial times in their lives and unless you've
[47:17.840 --> 47:21.360]  experienced that you don't know how to deal with so they live in these armored
[47:21.360 --> 47:26.520]  pampered palaces they have all their lives they've been pampered or but we
[47:26.520 --> 47:30.520]  all went to all of those of us that went to college we know who these guys are
[47:30.520 --> 47:34.560]  you know George Bush was the kind of guy that ran around you know with the
[47:34.560 --> 47:38.680]  with the cooler guys and then when trouble broke out and they got caught
[47:38.680 --> 47:43.680]  George Bush would rat him out and then he'd say no he didn't that's who George
[47:43.680 --> 47:47.960]  Bush was and Al Gore was that kind of guy you know well it's worse than that
[47:47.960 --> 47:53.200]  remember about those remember back in like 1991 George Bush senior was on
[47:53.200 --> 47:56.960]  national TV at a grocery store and he's he stepped back and he said what is that
[47:56.960 --> 47:59.960]  and they said well it's a scanner you know it'd been in for a decade he goes
[47:59.960 --> 48:04.760]  what is that what is that laser and they said sir this is how they scan the food
[48:04.760 --> 48:08.560]  I mean the guy never went and bought his own food he hadn't been in a grocery
[48:08.560 --> 48:13.680]  store exactly and it all these guys you know we know who they are and and and
[48:13.680 --> 48:18.080]  they're the only reason they're any hassles with it with an army you got
[48:18.080 --> 48:23.200]  but well put I have to use that one I'll credit you with it any hassle with an
[48:23.200 --> 48:28.200]  army perfect and Al Gore was that you know the kid that used to brown nose the
[48:28.200 --> 48:31.800]  teacher all the time you know I mean this is who these people he's a sack of
[48:31.800 --> 48:36.480]  crap he's a fake yeah and then that's who was so we all know who these people are
[48:36.480 --> 48:42.280]  in life so it's like it's still high school but now it's serious so in going
[48:42.280 --> 48:47.360]  back to this greatest depression so we already have the consumer in debt 14
[48:47.360 --> 48:50.720]  trillion the government in debt and why it's going to be worse than the greatest
[48:50.720 --> 48:55.040]  depression now let's add on some other things people are watching their whole
[48:55.040 --> 49:03.880]  lives unfolding in front of them as their their IRAs and 401ks dissolve they
[49:03.880 --> 49:10.360]  didn't have that back then and now they have another thing back then we were a
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.680]  very different country when we did get out of the depression it was the
[49:14.680 --> 49:19.600]  beginning of World War two and we were the world manufacturers bar none we
[49:19.600 --> 49:25.120]  don't have that anymore so now we're going into this mess in a worse mess
[49:25.120 --> 49:29.840]  than we've ever been and here's another big one back then we were in ascending
[49:29.840 --> 49:37.160]  society we were not a declining society we had a growing class of people that
[49:37.160 --> 49:42.360]  came in you know what people had dignity back then they weren't like they are
[49:42.360 --> 49:47.600]  and we weren't a not just economically declining we were not a physically age
[49:47.600 --> 49:52.040]  wise we're one of the oldest civilizations on earth and so very
[49:52.040 --> 49:56.640]  bad shape yes so we have an aging population a bunch of cops and black
[49:56.640 --> 50:01.040]  schemas strutting around working for Eddie Haskell you can't put perfume on a
[50:01.040 --> 50:08.280]  pig folks this whole thing is a rotten warm eaten husk stay with us with rising
[50:08.280 --> 50:12.400]  unemployment and an economy that continues to fail comes an increase in
[50:12.400 --> 50:17.160]  crime are you safe when you walk to your car are your kids safe when they go out
[50:17.160 --> 50:22.240]  everyone needs something to give that extra edge in case of an attack you need
[50:22.240 --> 50:28.080]  DPS pepper spray from mr. defense calm DPS is the strongest pepper spray on the
[50:28.080 --> 50:31.760]  market and is the same spray used by hundreds of law enforcement agencies

[53:52.560 --> 53:56.840]  two cents throughout that recap the first three or four phases and then get
[53:56.840 --> 54:01.240]  into the latter phase and they think they're going to use all these militarized
[54:01.240 --> 54:05.840]  police steroid head cops a lot of the cops are good they're openly saying
[54:05.840 --> 54:08.440]  they're not going to go along with this the military saying they don't want to
[54:08.440 --> 54:12.240]  shoot at Americans but they're now acclimating the public and telling us to
[54:12.240 --> 54:18.520]  get ready for it which means they intend to use them well yeah you know we put
[54:18.520 --> 54:24.680]  nothing past them of course I mean we're fighting a war now in Iraq for reasons
[54:24.680 --> 54:30.600]  that have been proven false whether or not you know they were known they were
[54:30.600 --> 54:35.840]  false as academic at this point the fact is they're false so killing innocent
[54:35.840 --> 54:40.440]  people for false reasons I mean where does it stop so you know there's nothing
[54:40.440 --> 54:44.720]  I would put past them you know read my lips no new taxes I didn't have sex with
[54:44.720 --> 54:49.320]  that woman Monica Lewinsky I smoked but I didn't inhale you know I mean it was
[54:49.320 --> 54:53.080]  thought of who's saying those weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda
[54:53.080 --> 54:58.320]  it's beyond me why anyone would believe anything that they say so of course you
[54:58.320 --> 55:02.760]  know they you know we expect the government to respond in the worst
[55:02.760 --> 55:09.440]  possible way and so the three phases are before revolution is that first we're
[55:09.440 --> 55:13.920]  going to see the collapse of 09 and that's going to be when the retail
[55:13.920 --> 55:17.560]  sector in a commercial real estate sector oh we and of course the credit
[55:17.560 --> 55:22.640]  card sector collapses too you know we're we're we're researchers and we're
[55:22.640 --> 55:28.800]  finding people for example in a cab cab rides now cab drivers are telling us
[55:28.800 --> 55:34.840]  that more and more people are putting cab rides on on on their credit cards
[55:34.840 --> 55:38.960]  because they they don't have the cash so the next shoot a fall after that is
[55:38.960 --> 55:43.160]  going to be the credit card crunch when people have been postponing their future
[55:43.160 --> 55:50.080]  by putting their their charges on their credit cards so after the collapse then
[55:50.080 --> 55:54.760]  we have the greatest depression people are going to be in the streets as we say
[55:54.760 --> 55:59.440]  you know when people lose everything and they have nothing to lose they lose
[55:59.440 --> 56:03.600]  it so we're going to go through the greatest depression obama ramen is
[56:03.600 --> 56:07.920]  going to be that that little grace period in there when the when the people
[56:07.920 --> 56:11.240]  think that they're going to have their their savior is going to come up with a
[56:11.240 --> 56:16.280]  great plan although they continue to ignore what the plan is and for just a
[56:16.280 --> 56:21.120]  moment I'd like to speak about the plan he's going to create new two point five
[56:21.120 --> 56:25.640]  million new jobs ostensibly and he's going to create this great works project
[56:25.640 --> 56:29.400]  where they're going to get the money from number one and they're going to print
[56:29.400 --> 56:34.880]  it of course and number two is so what 2.5 million jobs over how long we just
[56:34.880 --> 56:38.600]  lost two million this year so it's not going to make up anything and we have
[56:38.600 --> 56:43.600]  millions more coming online after that we're going to see the revolution those
[56:43.600 --> 56:47.840]  are the four big trends that we have under the 11 trends that we've come out
[56:47.840 --> 56:52.440]  with for the top 10 trends from those trends the rest is going to shape
[56:52.440 --> 56:57.960]  itself the revolution yourself people like myself we're talking about that
[56:57.960 --> 57:02.000]  most people are not prepared for it people are not but they weren't prepared
[57:02.000 --> 57:07.080]  for the recession I mean look we went on for a half a year more three quarters of
[57:07.080 --> 57:12.200]  the year with them debating whether or not we were in a recession so certainly
[57:12.200 --> 57:16.240]  they're not going to admit we're going to go into a depression and certainly
[57:16.240 --> 57:20.040]  they're not going to admit that we're ready for revolution well suddenly the
[57:20.040 --> 57:23.800]  IMF World Bank the Prime Minister of Canada Gordon Brown they are starting
[57:23.800 --> 57:27.920]  to talk about depression does that mean it's coming sooner rather than later I
[57:27.920 --> 57:32.600]  want to break down how this revolution will manifest itself what it will look
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.560]  like what the triggers are going to be I've said for years it's going to be
[57:36.560 --> 57:42.280]  police shooting a young person in the back look at what we just saw in Greece and
[57:42.280 --> 57:45.120]  then I feel sorry for the police and military because you're going to get

[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:26.120]  phases towards revolution and worldwide rioting and revolution that will be
[1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:31.400]  sustained the military is now saying that they are prepared to engage the
[1:00:31.400 --> 1:00:35.800]  American people the Army War College is saying this now there is no longer any
[1:00:35.800 --> 1:00:40.000]  doubt about that Gerald Salente how do you see the revolution kicking off how

[1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:57.600]  come the revolution we do not forecast a 1776 style revolution to spontaneously
[1:00:57.600 --> 1:01:03.680]  erupt it will happen in stages it will spread among the classes and be waged in
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:09.680]  many forms over the internet in town halls on the ballots as well as at the
[1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:15.400]  barricades what will be the spark that ignites it the final straw bailout
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:21.400]  another tax height disparaging entitlements or will be or will it be
[1:01:21.400 --> 1:01:27.120]  the ultimate quote let them eat cake policy that pushes people past the
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:32.920]  breaking point now this who will break first the former middle class that lost
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:40.480]  their jobs 401ks pensions and even their homes jobless blue collar and paycheck
[1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:45.560]  to paycheck workers their credit maxed out and heading toward homeless the
[1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:52.160]  young and restless with dead-end jobs or no jobs who believe their future had
[1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:58.400]  been stolen and want revenge the artist and intellectuals on one hand the
[1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:03.480]  hardcore conservatives and passion patriots on the other united in outrage
[1:02:03.480 --> 1:02:10.560]  at big brother's control of the entire socio-economic and political system one
[1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:16.680]  of the above some of the above all of the above who will fire the shot heard
[1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:24.240]  around the world so that's how we pose it and I tell the story in here of my
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:29.040]  meeting with John Connolly of course you know was the governor of Texas sitting
[1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:36.440]  in front of JFK and took the bullet in the back and it was in 1992 and Connolly
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:42.080]  had asked to meet me because in one of my early books the trend tracking in 1989
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:48.960]  I had forecast a new third-party and mentioned someone like Ross Perot so the
[1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:54.040]  Connolly John Connolly his wife Nellie through this fellow who put the the
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:58.960]  meeting together John Jay Hooker from Tennessee we went to the book depository
[1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:03.880]  and the Texas book school book depository and I have a photo it's in the
[1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:07.800]  transjournal of me Connolly and his wife Nellie standing in front of the book
[1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:13.800]  depository and and John Connolly was a dying man and I could see it and by the
[1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:19.560]  way this was their first time back 1992 since the assassination and he's telling
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:22.800]  us the story of what happened that day was we were parked out in front of
[1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:26.840]  limousine but that's the side by the way the shot that everyone sees of the
[1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:32.040]  book depository that's the side of the building and and I knew he was a dying
[1:03:32.040 --> 1:03:38.080]  man because he had these terrible purplish splotches on his on his hands
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:43.680]  he he was on massive doses of prednisone cortisone to to for his lung
[1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:50.360]  inflection and his lung infection and my father had died of same kind of
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:54.520]  disease Gerald Salente stay there we'll hear the John Connolly story former
[1:03:54.520 --> 1:03:58.600]  governor of Texas story when we get back from the grassy knoll and then we'll
[1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:02.600]  get more into how you see this revolution unfolding and how it will end how
[1:04:02.600 --> 1:04:06.400]  you see us coming out of it stay with us
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:10.800]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:14.080]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:17.640]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[1:04:17.640 --> 1:04:20.920]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:24.760]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:27.760]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:31.640]  bailout for a special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:35.160]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred and fifty
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:39.080]  billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:43.280]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:47.240]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:51.920]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[1:04:51.920 --> 1:04:55.920]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[1:04:55.920 --> 1:05:00.160]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:04.000]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.600]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:11.760]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:15.800]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans
[1:05:15.800 --> 1:05:19.480]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:23.640]  whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody
[1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:26.560]  out there listening it's very important for you understand that by having a
[1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:30.120]  supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot less control
[1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:34.360]  over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:37.520]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you
[1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:41.480]  you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storeable food that's safe from

[1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:49.520]  the rest of this hour trendsresearch.com a lot of people say I don't care
[1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:52.800]  about the future I don't you know care about anybody else but myself that's
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:57.480]  the most foolish statement in the world we are all in a sea of humanity together
[1:06:57.480 --> 1:07:01.520]  on this ship going through space that is planet Earth everything that we do
[1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:04.480]  affects others everything that other people do affects us I see so many
[1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:09.000]  foolish people two three years ago when I was saying they're going to implode the
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:13.040]  subprime markets I'd gone to Bilderberg I'd infiltrated they were saying they
[1:07:13.040 --> 1:07:16.800]  were going to implode the subprime market by design to start a derivatives
[1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:21.080]  crisis to have a global consolidation of wealth set up a world government set up
[1:07:21.080 --> 1:07:24.400]  a carbon tax paid directly to the private central banks that private
[1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:28.240]  central banks would issue their own quote government bonds which the fellow
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:31.160]  reserve announced last week in the New York Times they're going to be doing
[1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:35.400]  this is this is the private central banks becoming the world government
[1:07:35.400 --> 1:07:39.400]  openly now I believe they may have overplayed their hand and created such
[1:07:39.400 --> 1:07:44.480]  a Ponzi scheme and so many of their minions like Madoff may have been so
[1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:48.680]  greedy that it's even endangering their own architecture they are seeing that
[1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:51.840]  the financial times of London they're claiming that they've overdone it they
[1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:55.280]  said well this is good for us to consolidate banks and insurance companies
[1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:59.920]  and get power but this endangers our own system so I want to talk to Joel
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:04.400]  Salente about that whole issue after he finishes the story about former governor
[1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:09.000]  John Connolly he was shot in the car with JFK they're in the school book a
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:13.520]  depository building looking out the window please continue the story well
[1:08:13.520 --> 1:08:18.280]  what happened was we were going back and I noticed I'm sitting across from him
[1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:22.240]  that there were these splotches on his hands these big purplish splotches he was
[1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:27.320]  on Prendazone and it occurred to me you know that he was a dying man he ended
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:34.760]  up dying actually in June and this was in late October when we met and the as
[1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:38.840]  well we're going back into the Anatole hotel he said to me I read you read your
[1:08:38.840 --> 1:08:42.680]  book trend tracking and I know your heart is in the right place he said but
[1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:47.800]  you don't have a clue what's going on and neither do the American people because
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:55.040]  if they did there'd be a revolution in this country this was in 1992 and you
[1:08:55.040 --> 1:09:00.760]  know I I knew what he meant because I had been around long enough to have been
[1:09:00.760 --> 1:09:05.760]  I began my career I ran the number two guy running the mayoral campaign in
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:11.040]  Yonkers New York in 1971 and then they sent me up to Albany and I was an
[1:09:11.040 --> 1:09:16.480]  assistant to the secretary of the New York State Senate and I spent from 73 to
[1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:23.360]  79 in between DC and Chicago as a government affairs specialist and I had
[1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:27.400]  been you know for a trade association with chemicals being one of the fields
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:32.360]  so I had been around long enough spent time with Ronald Reagan and and I knew
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:36.360]  what the story looked like so when Connolly said that to me it didn't come
[1:09:36.360 --> 1:09:41.720]  as a shock and I know and I wondered you know when would it happen and now the
[1:09:41.720 --> 1:09:48.280]  when is now absolutely a napkin get everything designed to destroy the
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:53.360]  middle class to come to put all power not a free market economy not a vibrant
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:57.080]  economy because that's not good for monopolies at the expense of the economy
[1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:00.920]  at the expense of the public worldwide these internationalists have done
[1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:04.880]  everything they can to destroy the real economy and transfer everything into the
[1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:12.680]  fiat Las Vegas economy now expanding on that when we first came into the
[1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:18.560]  segment I made the point that they stated the the financial elite stated
[1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:22.200]  they were going to engineer a worldwide collapse to consolidate things they
[1:10:22.200 --> 1:10:25.680]  would then pose as the saviors and bring in open world government as the
[1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:31.200]  solution but now it appears that that they are mismanaging things and that
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:36.880]  this is spiraling out of control can you speak directly to that a and then be
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:42.680]  we've seen a flutella of hundreds and hundreds the media is festooned with the
[1:10:42.680 --> 1:10:47.400]  Wall Street Journal the Financial Times of London the French news agency
[1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:51.720]  Canadian papers saying yes we're in a world government yes it's tyrannical
[1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:55.840]  for your own good yes we're going to use troops on you yes we want to take your
[1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:01.960]  guns but it's for your own good so so a are is it out of their control now and
[1:11:01.960 --> 1:11:06.440]  b why are they trumpeting world government now it's totally out of their
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:11.080]  control as I said you know if there's an illuminati the illuminati are the
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:14.800]  people that are control are in control right now just let's look at the
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:19.960]  players for example we'll look at the in the United States I mean who are the
[1:11:19.960 --> 1:11:25.000]  congressional leaders law the Democrats you have what you have Pelosi read you
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:30.480]  have a Barney Frank Christopher Dodd Biden and on the Republicans we have
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:37.760]  Bond Bonner who else who was a big-name Republican at this time I mean how
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:42.720]  about rural and hardy and ebb and costel I mean look at these people there's
[1:11:42.720 --> 1:11:46.400]  anybody out there think that these politicians are smarter than them look
[1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:51.040]  at Bernanke I mean it looks like a sad beagle this guy what what brains are
[1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:56.600]  out there look at Paulson they think of the things that he said last year May
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:01.600]  7th he said that the worst of the economic crisis was behind us I mean
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:06.200]  one after another so who are the people in charge look at it go over to France
[1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:10.600]  what do you have Sarkozy you know the little American you have Berlusconi
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:15.560]  over in Italy he's like a rocky six movie you know he's been back so many
[1:12:15.560 --> 1:12:22.280]  times yeah Grandma Merkel over in Germany Gordon Brown over in England
[1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:28.040]  Gordon Brown another shade of beige you go around the world look at the leaders
[1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:33.720]  who are these people no it's going to be a let them eat cake time it's out of
[1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:39.240]  control there's nothing that they can do and as I said and I'll say it again when
[1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:44.880]  people lose everything and they have nothing to lose they lose it so for
[1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:51.000]  example we're seeing all these massive firings going on who's going to where
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.040]  how are people going to afford to pay their mortgages to pay their insurance
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:13:00.400]  they're not going to and this is the this is beyond this is beyond the pale
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:05.960]  of any belief they're raising taxes across the board property taxes school
[1:13:05.960 --> 1:13:12.000]  taxes now I'm not a stupid person so when they come to me and say Mr. Salenti
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:17.480]  we're raising the taxes on your building or your property whatever because the
[1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:23.960]  valuations have gone up well how about lowering them because the valuations
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:27.360]  have gone down well in cases where they're going to raise them well in
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:31.240]  cases where there are lowering them they're just doing one-time assessments
[1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:35.760]  in Texas Wyoming and all over the place cities just say well we got to build
[1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:40.280]  some new roads and curves so every house gets a 15 to 20 thousand dollar one-time
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:43.640]  assessment and the people are like I don't have a job I'm already about to
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:47.120]  lose my house where do you think the money is going to come from and the
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:52.000]  locals say look give us the money or a SWAT team's coming well and again this
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:56.040]  is where we're going to have the breakdown because people a date when you
[1:13:56.040 --> 1:14:01.040]  don't have it you can't squeeze more out of it people are going to become very
[1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:06.080]  ugly and very violent the ads that you are running on your show for lasers and
[1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:12.880]  and other kinds of things are going to be it's survival is going to be a big
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:17.560]  business I'm a close combat martial artist I've been practicing for over a
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:24.720]  quarter of a century I you know I'm armed I have my SKS and it's registered
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:30.320]  for you know anybody listening out there that thinks it's it's an illegal
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:37.120]  operation no no I will protect myself if I have to I haven't been put on this
[1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:40.840]  earth for somebody else to think that they're better than I am it could take
[1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:45.720]  my life Gerald Salante I want to run through a whole line of questioning with
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:48.760]  quick answers from you if I can because there's so much I want to pick your
[1:14:48.760 --> 1:14:53.040]  brain on but but but going back to my second question why are they trumpeting
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:56.120]  that yes we're setting up world government yes we've been setting it up
[1:14:56.120 --> 1:15:01.160]  in secret yes it's anti-democratic but it's for your own good well because
[1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:04.720]  these are the kind I mean because it's a takeover it's you know they as I said
[1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:08.480]  you know Washington's been taken over by Wall Street and they're going to keep
[1:15:08.480 --> 1:15:13.120]  saying it's for our own good but it's not going to do any good again the people
[1:15:13.120 --> 1:15:16.720]  that are in control it's out of their hands why are they killing the Golden
[1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:21.040]  Goose I mean they they have this system they have the system why do people get
[1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:25.760]  into politics you know Eisenhower had a great quote he said anybody that would
[1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:31.640]  want to run for president had to be crazy or or or psychologically you know
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:37.480]  do it derain their control freaks well yeah that's the crazy so you know he
[1:15:37.480 --> 1:15:42.160]  said if you're if you're called on to serve that's different but these people
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:46.040]  spend their whole lives trying to tell other people how to live so you know
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:51.600]  the system is breaking down the big story behind everything that's going on
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:56.920]  here and this is what we wrote back in 2002 the summer edition of the
[1:15:56.920 --> 1:16:04.120]  trends journal Empire America fading fast this isn't an economic crisis the
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:11.320]  empire is in decline we can see in the future these secessionist movements that
[1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:17.360]  are taking root gaining more and more strength as a matter of fact I spoke at
[1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:23.280]  one in Vermont this past November and it's one of the more active ones in the
[1:16:23.280 --> 1:16:27.320]  country well Gerald Gerald we have this huge trillion plus dollar a year
[1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:31.800]  military industrial complex it's imploding worldwide and appears that
[1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:35.560]  this whole apparatus this predatory system is going to implode back to the
[1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:40.840]  US only and then they're then going to preditate and feed on us here
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:45.480]  domestically I mean is that the plan I don't know what the plan is but I do
[1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:50.680]  know that they will do anything to keep the people in line and that our you know
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:55.920]  the freedoms I mean look what happens every time there's a political convention
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:17:00.520]  you know they bring in the stormtroopers you can't step out of line look what
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:04.280]  happened here in New York from the Republican and Democratic convention
[1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:08.560]  I think it was the Republican 2004 I was there I mean look at the videotape of
[1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:12.640]  the of the the police assaulting innocent people and rounding them up and
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:17.960]  pushing force charges on them and throwing them in jail this is America
[1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:21.440]  this isn't the America that I grew up to love and by the way they lost over a
[1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:25.520]  thousand lawsuits over that but they don't care they just pay them off with
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:28.800]  tax money Gerald Salente is our guest when we get back I want to quickly get
[1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:32.080]  into their attack on the internet they're moving to shut down the old web
[1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.960]  force us onto a highly regulated internet to that's part of Obama's big
[1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:40.720]  upgrade made off I mean this is the former head of the Nasdaq showing a
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:45.000]  window into the criminal class that's literally ruling us the Eddie Haskells
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:50.920]  with an army I want to get into the fact that the elites are all leaving the
[1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:54.640]  United States and leaving Israel and leaving other key areas why are the

[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:30.720]  all right Gerald Salente I want to go to calls in the next segment so let me go
[1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:35.760]  to these calls quickly if anybody was doubting how criminal Wall Street is
[1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:39.440]  made of they're now saying it could be over a hundred billion not fifty
[1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:45.960]  billion stolen from charities pension funds government pension funds Jewish
[1:22:45.960 --> 1:22:51.600]  groups ripping off his own sons I mean this is the type of kleptocracy that we
[1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:56.560]  have and it turns out the brokerage firms and banks were knowingly involved
[1:22:56.560 --> 1:23:00.640]  in all of this wedding that's what this derivative system is is a Ponzi scheme
[1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:06.280]  oh yeah yeah I don't think they should call her a Ponzi scheme anymore Ponzi
[1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:10.840]  was small change compared to these criminals you know let's call it a
[1:23:10.840 --> 1:23:17.800]  Matlock you know I mean you know if this thing is it's endemic it's throughout
[1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:23.560]  all of wall this is what Wall Street has become you know what's what's bad for
[1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:29.800]  Wall Street Alex is great for Main Street and I'll tell you why it's Wall
[1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:35.400]  Street that killed Main Street it's Wall Street we always snagling that allows
[1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:41.600]  these huge developers to borrow all of this money on leverage build these huge
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:48.640]  malls and then the criminals in hand the the politicians who get
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:54.400]  all these payoffs they call them campaign contributions then they give these huge
[1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:59.840]  developers all of these breaks you know these loan guarantees they give them
[1:23:59.840 --> 1:24:06.320]  access road building and and tax breaks and what they've done is they've put
[1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:13.840]  Main Street out of business this this belief that we need a Wall Street so
[1:24:13.840 --> 1:24:18.840]  that we can keep creating the ugliness that they've created I mean my god does
[1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:24.400]  anyone like driving down a street and seeing nothing but strip malls and
[1:24:24.400 --> 1:24:30.280]  malls compared to the old beautiful cities and by the way we're now in
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:36.640]  Kingston New York and appropriately without knowing it but it maybe we did
[1:24:36.640 --> 1:24:42.320]  at some level we're right off the most historic corner in the United States
[1:24:42.320 --> 1:24:47.200]  we're right on it the only corner in the US where there's a stone building on
[1:24:47.200 --> 1:24:54.120]  each corner dating back to the 1600s and also Kingston was one of the
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:59.440]  core hotspots of the revolution the Senate House is still here and it was
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:04.200]  the first capital of New York State we're here because it's a walking
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:11.240]  community we have all these beautiful old buildings and I we and we we support
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:18.720]  all the local people around that as this dies as this these giants fall we're
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:24.720]  going to start seeing a return to local and so because what we also do with the
[1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:28.960]  Trends Research Institute when we write the Trends Journal is we give people
[1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:35.920]  trend posts to follow to profit and to avoid dangers as this thing unfolds more
[1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:41.320]  and more the real estate buys and there will be but not yet are going to be in
[1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:45.760]  these kind of communities where people could live and where they work where they
[1:25:45.760 --> 1:25:50.200]  shop where they have a community the only thing that's going to save people
[1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:55.400]  during this greatest oppression is to build the strongest communities that
[1:25:55.400 --> 1:26:01.720]  they can not a federal or a state but a local that's where the survival is
[1:26:01.720 --> 1:26:06.320]  going to instead of vertical integration you know going back to local control and
[1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:09.840]  true diversity and sovereignty shifting gears back to something you said a few
[1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:16.480]  minutes ago they've weaponized the market these private brokerage firms and
[1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:21.200]  central banks can issue endless liquidity themselves they create the monsters
[1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:26.600]  like Walmart and others they consolidate the economy like a giant risk game
[1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:30.280]  until the final phase when there's nothing left and they're sitting there
[1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:33.920]  with all the currency all the power all the money but they destroyed their own
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:37.640]  markets and that's why Wall Street was aware of the criminal activity with
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:41.600]  their Ponzi schemes and that's why they moved in with the police state but again
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:45.960]  what is going to support the police state when there's no taxing base exactly
[1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:50.760]  as we said there's going to be high levels of anarchy and revolution and
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:54.640]  you know the other thing is that the other reason why we're at where we're
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:27:00.400]  at well we located here it's a very rich area in terms of agriculture
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:06.200]  academics manufacturing great transportation the Hudson River beauty
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:11.400]  the Hudson River Valley so it's going to be these kind of places and these kind
[1:27:11.400 --> 1:27:17.160]  of things something old is dying but something new will be born and you know
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:21.720]  I'm a world traveler and the one thing I can say and I mean this with all my
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:26.600]  heart is every way you go people are always envious of the United States
[1:27:26.600 --> 1:27:30.720]  because they still think that we have the freedoms of course that we don't have
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:36.920]  but what we do have that no one else does have is really an innovative spirit
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:41.800]  and an ability to think that isn't restricted by cultural norms so there
[1:27:41.800 --> 1:27:44.800]  are great opportunities and I'm gonna have you back on again in the near
[1:27:44.800 --> 1:27:51.200]  future next year if you'll do it to do a whole show on opportunities in this
[1:27:51.200 --> 1:27:55.400]  crisis not just to protect yourself but to thrive when we come back let's talk
[1:27:55.400 --> 1:28:00.680]  about how you see the revolution unfolding itself and then how you see us
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:05.920]  that the the the different avenues of how we will come out of it we're on the

[1:30:19.280 --> 1:30:22.880]  constantly asked me to give them the date as to when they should be finished
[1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:27.520]  stocking up on food we've been so beaten up by stock market banking housing and
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:31.040]  unemployment crashes that were desensitized and frozen and active like
[1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:35.440]  the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually increasingly hot water will
[1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:40.080]  snap out of it we now have a deadline Joe Biden said it's gonna happen former
[1:30:40.080 --> 1:30:44.600]  secretary of state Colin Powell went on CBS meet the press and pointed to about
[1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:48.440]  January 22nd is the time a major international incident would force the
[1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:52.680]  new president to make unpopular decisions while I take the general
[1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:56.480]  at his word my best advice is to have your food in your possession prior to

[1:31:01.400 --> 1:31:06.240]  deadline for disaster ask yourself is it better to have too much too soon or too
[1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:14.000]  little too late call 800-409-5633 or on the web e-foods direct dot com
[1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:36.200]  all we've got is the cards that life deals us but there's the question of
[1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:46.800]  how we play those cards the good news is we've been here for decades warning
[1:31:46.800 --> 1:31:50.840]  people about what was gonna happen and explaining just how it would unfold and
[1:31:50.840 --> 1:31:59.640]  exactly what we said is now happening so people are paying attention you know
[1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:05.040]  it's not tuning our horn it's just a fact to give the listeners an idea of how
[1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:11.480]  many people were reaching I have in the last few days been contacted by some of
[1:32:11.480 --> 1:32:15.840]  the biggest names in Hollywood that I didn't know some of the biggest names
[1:32:15.840 --> 1:32:20.040]  in television that I didn't know I've talked to other people I've known for a
[1:32:20.040 --> 1:32:24.400]  long time in Hollywood and they say that if we thought the Patriot Liberty 911
[1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:29.680]  truth move an anti-new order movement was big before with the producers and
[1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:36.000]  directors and writers and actors and actresses it is many times bigger now so
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:39.800]  fighting the new world order being aware of this is the hottest thing and it's not
[1:32:39.800 --> 1:32:43.920]  some trend it's not some new trendiness the establishment is trying to suppress
[1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:48.720]  it it is an underground movement that is bigger than the above-ground false
[1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:53.360]  mainstream media projection telling us that the establishment loves us and the
[1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:55.880]  establishment isn't corrupt and the establishment is going to take good care
[1:32:55.880 --> 1:33:01.880]  of us and so as their false reality begins to fall to the real reality we
[1:33:01.880 --> 1:33:05.520]  have a great opportunity to actually turn this thing around I have a few final
[1:33:05.520 --> 1:33:09.160]  questions for you Gerald Salenty and then I want to get to some phone calls but
[1:33:09.160 --> 1:33:13.240]  finishing up how do you see this I mean when does physical revolution I know you
[1:33:13.240 --> 1:33:17.240]  can't mark a date or a month but what a year out two years out a lot of experts
[1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:21.240]  we talked to you say about two years out some are now saying a year out some say
[1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:25.280]  three years out governments are saying two or three years out government Pentagon
[1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:30.480]  report saying two years out a year out when does the breakdown really occur and
[1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:37.400]  then how do you see it playing out well we have forecast 2012 that's that that's
[1:33:37.400 --> 1:33:42.880]  the year that we're pinpointing the revolution just as for example we're
[1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:47.000]  in a recession we're actually we're we're in the early stages of depression now
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:50.840]  but when you look at the real unemployment numbers as you well know
[1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:56.560]  they're they're ranging between what 12 to 14% that's even according to the
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:00.200]  government statistics when they put in the people that are no longer actively
[1:34:00.200 --> 1:34:06.320]  seeking jobs so just as they said for example that we were in a recession a
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:10.480]  year ago even though they weren't admitting it will be in revolution for a
[1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:15.400]  while and they won't admit it we believe the official date will come around 2012
[1:34:15.400 --> 1:34:19.720]  if not sooner we're going to start seeing the first signs of it we believe
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:24.840]  this winter there's going to be food riots is going to be housing riots
[1:34:24.840 --> 1:34:28.440]  there's going to be riots at many different levels and the form they take
[1:34:28.440 --> 1:34:34.520]  is very difficult you know for example we had you know in 2000 and it was
[1:34:34.520 --> 1:34:40.640]  December 14th 2000 USA Today ran our top trends and the first trend was they
[1:34:40.640 --> 1:34:46.120]  read 2001 won't be our year trends here says and we warned that a wave of
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:50.440]  anti-Americanism would sweep the globe and that Americans wouldn't be safe at
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:55.960]  home or abroad we didn't know for example that it would be 9 11 but we knew
[1:34:55.960 --> 1:35:00.920]  the flashpoint was there the flashpoint we believe is going to start happening
[1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:07.040]  become visible on the streets this winter is going to be uprisings they're
[1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:12.320]  going to be violent and they will be suppressed or try to be suppressed you
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:16.960]  know in my book trends 2000 which I wrote in 96 came out in January finished
[1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:23.080]  it in 96 came out in January in 97 we had this come the revolution but in that
[1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:29.080]  we wrote and you know it may be naively that we were in a third world country
[1:35:29.080 --> 1:35:35.040]  where the the military of the police would fire on their own people and we're
[1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:39.400]  hoping that you know hope is a hope is probably the most bankrupt word in the
[1:35:39.400 --> 1:35:44.680]  metaphysical language or dictionary but what but we would believe that we're
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:49.680]  greater than the troops firing on their own people so we saw the revolution
[1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:55.000]  coming a long time how do you see it playing out it's difficult again I
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:58.720]  would say the first thing with that the reality kind of things are going to be
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:04.080]  people being cold hungry and nowhere to sleep and what we can see rioting of
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:08.400]  maybe street riots food riots crime by the way is good that's going to be the
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:13.720]  false flag they're going to use crime as the example and an anarchist in the
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:17.960]  crowd and the public will will will beg for troops on the streets to save them
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:23.120]  exactly so they could do a false flag kind of operation like that and for
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:26.880]  example when we caught him in Denver the police was in Denver post attacking
[1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:30.440]  other police for the news cameras right what happened here in New York so and
[1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:34.800]  and the same thing by the way with these so-called anarchists you know these
[1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:38.800]  people that always have you know these black caps covering their faces and
[1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:43.120]  these these masks you know who have the time their their foundation run a mob
[1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:47.680]  together at the time their cops exactly so we don't know who they are so it can
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:53.400]  be that kind of a false flag but we we we those are the most likely scenario
[1:36:53.400 --> 1:36:57.160]  okay well I see that the and by the way one of the groups that people are not
[1:36:57.160 --> 1:37:01.000]  going to expect that going to be very violent and very upset well maybe they
[1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:07.000]  too are going to be all these college students that have 40 $50,000 worth of
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:12.400]  debt on their shoulders to being hounded to pay it and then they can't even get a
[1:37:12.400 --> 1:37:18.160]  job at Starbucks so that's going to be the revolutionary crowd because the you
[1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:23.440]  know the young people I mean I'm speaking for myself a person over 60
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:27.840]  days don't have the energy that you had before well mr. Salente in the time we've
[1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:34.440]  got I see the flashpoint at factories as we saw in the 20s and 30s and 40s or the
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:40.560]  bonus marchers that I see vets revolting I see college students I see
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:43.800]  government workers when they find out that they've had their pension funds
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:50.120]  stolen and that leads me to the big flashpoint 401ks down over 50% clearly
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:54.360]  going to continue what are the firemen and teachers and police and government
[1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:57.440]  people going to do when they find out that that that they've had their pension
[1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:02.920]  funds stolen by the bankers well again this is why we're looking at it as we're
[1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:08.960]  saying that these are only symptoms of a much greater trend and it's the decline
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:13.120]  in fall of empire America and I think we're gonna see a many police and
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:18.280]  military actually join the people we well we're well you know there's that one
[1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:22.040]  group and then there's the other group you know that you when you look at
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:26.840]  undeveloped countries and we're an undeveloping nation at this point you
[1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:32.680]  know that the police and the federalese are the most corrupt among anyone so you
[1:38:32.680 --> 1:38:39.160]  know we could have that core in there too we don't know absolutely okay a few
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:45.440]  final questions and I want to get to the phone calls staged terror you just
[1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:49.680]  mentioned false flag we see government stage terror attacks when they're in
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:38:54.120]  flooding economies to subconsciously at a primitive tribal level get the people
[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:59.280]  to rally around the government who will pose as their saviors so we see these
[1:38:59.280 --> 1:39:03.600]  government make work jobs this isn't like Roosevelt with building dams or
[1:39:03.600 --> 1:39:08.960]  building highway rest stops they're saying green core million man tattletale
[1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:15.320]  force million man domestic spy force I mean this is openly being announced so
[1:39:15.320 --> 1:39:19.720]  can you can you speak to false flags and then of course the type of make work
[1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:24.440]  that obama's promising well the well the false flags remember the main I mean
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:29.440]  the lucetania and there this is a report out now of course that the lucetania
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:35.720]  indeed was filled with armaments that they were bringing over using people as
[1:39:35.720 --> 1:39:40.040]  human shields to bring those over and of course the lucetania was one of the
[1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:44.680]  sparks that brought it u.s. into world war one which was by the way the most
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:50.200]  avoidable major war in modern history fought by you know brought about by
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:57.240]  fools and failing monarchies and and so we have a little bit of course I have
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:40:01.560]  to the Gulf of Tonkin incident that that never happened the way they said it did
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:06.360]  so there's one after another we don't know what they will be but we believe
[1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:12.600]  given the track record of what they've done in the past is no reason to rule out
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:17.560]  that they won't do it in the future and again we're fighting a war right now for
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:22.600]  reasons that are patently false Gerald Solente how do you see the attack on the
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:27.280]  web unfolding you know they've announced in in documents put up by internet to
[1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:31.040]  that private corporations in the government are going to take over the
[1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:35.640]  internet kill the old web basically and then force you onto a new internet where
[1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:40.160]  you have subdomains under their sites where you have no free speech and they
[1:40:40.160 --> 1:40:44.400]  can ban you or edit you or restrict you at will like YouTube and my space to when
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:48.080]  you have a sub account now Obama has announced he's going with that in the
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:51.920]  name of innovation he's created a new private council of the it heads and
[1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:56.320]  owners of the companies to work together and they have the violent radicalization
[1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:00.520]  act in congress where they say 9 11 truth works with al-qaeda and that they are
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:04.520]  going to ban these grips on the web and we're now seeing massive censorship of
[1:41:04.520 --> 1:41:08.640]  our work all over the internet info wars dot com prison planet dot com band and
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:14.480]  libraries government Wi-Fi systems how do you see that unfolding well I just
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:17.760]  before I jump into that because another thought came to my mind on the false
[1:41:17.760 --> 1:41:22.000]  flag issue and and the false leg will probably be we believe it'll be a
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:27.280]  Middle East and Iran being the most likely target that that would be where
[1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:33.720]  we would put our money on and also something oil related on on the Obama
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:39.200]  issue net neutrality it's going to be a very difficult one to control because
[1:41:39.200 --> 1:41:43.800]  there's a there's a whole cadre of people out there that are there are
[1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:48.840]  there are internet patriots that are going to do anything that they can not
[1:41:48.840 --> 1:41:54.480]  to make this happen and and of course it's it's the one card the freedom of
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:42:00.240]  the internet it's the major card I would say that could help free us from a
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:05.840]  global global dictatorship it's going to be a fight to the finish for the
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:11.480]  government to regulate the web we believe Gerald Solente projecting forward
[1:42:11.480 --> 1:42:15.000]  all the trends in your amazing track record of being accurate are you saying
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:20.320]  humanity will defeat the new world order and when will that come in 1213 1214
[1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:26.000]  you know we we believe that we're on the verge of a renaissance and I was as I
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:30.240]  was mentioning earlier we're the only country where we really do have this
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:34.960]  innovative freedom and I'm of Italian descent if I was born in Italy I would
[1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:39.120]  not be the trend forecaster I am I would have been too locked in to cultural
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:45.080]  norms and more ways we have that spirit what's happening is as you aptly point
[1:42:45.080 --> 1:42:50.000]  out that there's a globalization movement this bigger is better and as we
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:53.800]  know what's going on with the government with this whole banking system and as we
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:58.360]  saw from you know take the reports when they got this bailout money the banks
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:02.960]  were buying up smaller banks so they're going to create a national banking
[1:43:02.960 --> 1:43:08.200]  system with maybe three or four majors running it on the other hand we have
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:14.920]  breakdowns of businesses that hold their whole model Alex for instance a a
[1:43:14.920 --> 1:43:20.280]  big sporting goods or any of these kind of big chains may see they're built up
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:25.920]  of Starbucks they're built upon growth and expansion rather than more so I
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:31.200]  should say than increasing in store sales and an innovation and an innovation
[1:43:31.200 --> 1:43:35.320]  well I mean bottom line here people think that the New World Order is
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:39.560]  invincible Christians thought that Hitler was the antichrist in Europe and so
[1:43:39.560 --> 1:43:43.600]  they laid down to him and I'm a Christian but but modern Christians have been
[1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:47.280]  told lay down to corruption lay down to the chip lay down to big brother because
[1:43:47.280 --> 1:43:51.640]  it's invincible it's foretold regardless folks we have a duty to fight
[1:43:51.640 --> 1:43:55.520]  corruption you know duty is ours consequence belongs to God and I'm
[1:43:55.520 --> 1:43:59.360]  telling you these dinosaurs of the New World Order are rotten and can be
[1:43:59.360 --> 1:44:03.600]  defeated if people will just get up off their backsides and realize that they
[1:44:03.600 --> 1:44:07.320]  don't have a choice and I think with all this pain coming in a way it's going to
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:10.320]  be a good thing because it's going to force people to finally grow up and
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:14.720]  face reality what do you say to that you know something old is dying and
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:19.040]  ugly and corrupt it deserves to die as I said what's bad for Wall Street is
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:24.760]  wonderful for Main Street they kill this country they killed our communities
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:30.160]  they were the ones that funded these huge ugly developments not only in made
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:33.880]  office at the top of Wall Street I mean they're all a pack of crops at the top
[1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:36.680]  let's take some calls Ben in Virginia you're on the air with legendary
[1:44:36.680 --> 1:44:41.360]  trans forecaster Gerald Salente Ben go ahead in Virginia hey how you doing I
[1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:45.720]  love the show Alex I just wanted to ask where he thought banks like the free
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:50.000]  Lakota Bank is going to play out in this new conflict because the Lakota have
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:56.520]  actually started their own gold-based currency bank I think gold banks that
[1:44:56.520 --> 1:45:01.520]  come out and say that their assets your deposits are backed by gold are going to
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:06.240]  be one of the biggest businesses that anybody could ever imagine and because
[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:12.000]  that is well by the way here's a scenario that we're also doing relative to banks we
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:17.880]  believe that being that they're putting the mantle of FDR on on Obama it is very
[1:45:17.880 --> 1:45:24.480]  highly probable that they're going to call a bank holiday as FDR did also this
[1:45:24.480 --> 1:45:28.760]  after he was inaugurated is that the surprise is that the surprise Biden's
[1:45:28.760 --> 1:45:32.960]  saying that on the 21st or 22nd Obama's going to do something next month that
[1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:37.240]  people aren't going to like it could very well be because there's going to be
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:43.040]  we believe that the banking system it cannot sustain itself in its current
[1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:46.600]  form the way things are going now and a bank holiday for those that don't know
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:50.520]  means you can't get your money out and they devalue your money yeah and I love
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:55.760]  the words they use holiday you know like let's have a holiday the Patriot
[1:45:55.760 --> 1:46:01.920]  the new freedom initiative homeland security USA the fatherland anything
[1:46:01.920 --> 1:46:06.280]  else up in no that's just about it I just I really think that this free the
[1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:10.600]  code bank can be huge all right Darren in Maryland you're on the year with
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:17.080]  Gerald Solante God bless you gentlemen what do you how do you get playing out
[1:46:17.080 --> 1:46:25.040]  for those of us we're on state pensions or social security well it's going to be
[1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:29.000]  difficult and as Alex said you know when that when they close banks they
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:33.440]  devalue currencies so what you have going on here is that they're talking
[1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:37.880]  about a decline in commodity prices and how inexpensive things are becoming and
[1:46:37.880 --> 1:46:42.440]  that's very true but guess what your dollar is going to buy a lot less you
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:47.200]  know just in the last two weeks the dollars gone from against the euro the
[1:46:47.200 --> 1:46:53.080]  125 against the euro about two weeks ago to today's around 143 the dollars
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:57.560]  tanking the whole world knows what's going on the United States and they're
[1:46:57.560 --> 1:47:01.160]  not printing money I mean this is just digital money so yeah it's going to be
[1:47:01.160 --> 1:47:06.920]  very difficult for everyone absolutely happen with what's going to happen with
[1:47:06.920 --> 1:47:12.000]  food production with food you know well you know one of the things one of the
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:15.520]  trends that we're we're putting in the trends journal we're calling it well the
[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:19.320]  old victory gardens that they had during World War two people are going to start
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:23.360]  ripping up their useless lawns you know the growing grass that you can't eat or
[1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:27.280]  smoke you know the problem is the current delivery system for big
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:31.240]  agribusiness is going to break down and people are rapidly already converting to
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:35.200]  more locally grown produce is Gerald Salente has written about thank you
[1:47:35.200 --> 1:47:38.480]  Darren mark in Oregon trying to get everybody here mark in Oregon you're on
[1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:46.040]  the year yeah how do gentlemen I wanted to ask Gerald Joe have you any idea of
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:55.120]  the actual number of patriot militias that are in the United States and what
[1:47:55.120 --> 1:48:01.680]  will be the flash points which will bring these militias into the fray I I have
[1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:09.640]  no idea how many there are I think the flash point would be a an atrocity that
[1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:13.640]  would be committed by the I guess the redcoach you could call them at this
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:18.840]  point like us yeah it's something bigger you know we're we're you know
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:23.240]  Waco's what was the kind of thing where people wrote them off as a sex so you
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:28.120]  know yeah troops being overrun by protesters getting scared gunning down
[1:48:28.120 --> 1:48:31.640]  a crowd something that kind of thing you know something bigger than can state
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:35.360]  and then I wouldn't even say so much the militia most of those that are big and
[1:48:35.360 --> 1:48:39.120]  been infiltrated are being watched closely usually led by feds it's the
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:43.480]  groups you don't hear about it's the hunting club it's going to be those
[1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:47.080]  guys and then I really they're going to probably go out and target police and
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:50.200]  military that aren't even part of the larger operations and that's going to
[1:48:50.200 --> 1:48:53.920]  accelerate the crisis Gerald Salente stay right there I know you're a very

[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:26.720]  really flies when you're fighting the new world order Gerald Salenta is our
[1:52:26.720 --> 1:52:33.360]  guest for another 10 minutes and we have a very special guest in studio coming up
[1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:42.960]  text Mars Gerald I want to go back to as many of the calls as we can but I had
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:48.360]  one other question for you dealing with all of this again a lot of people are
[1:52:48.360 --> 1:52:54.040]  looking forward to having shooting wars the police and military and I believe
[1:52:54.040 --> 1:52:58.080]  the globalist actually looking forward to that because then that will destroy
[1:52:58.080 --> 1:53:02.720]  confidence further and then they can consolidate the economy even more but when
[1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:05.800]  the police are out confiscating guns and arresting people and shooting the
[1:53:05.800 --> 1:53:10.200]  public in the military is doing that what do they expect I mean I mean I know
[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:14.440]  I'm not relishing this I know you're not relishing this and I wonder what the
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:18.520]  rules of engagement for the American people should be through all of this
[1:53:18.520 --> 1:53:25.400]  well you know I think you hit upon one before when we were talking about who
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:29.760]  will be the first likely groups who will fire the first shots who will protest
[1:53:29.760 --> 1:53:36.480]  and what we saw in Chicago with those workers refusing to leave I think we're
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:40.120]  gonna see more of that kind of thing where people are just gonna say no I
[1:53:40.120 --> 1:53:44.160]  have nowhere else to go I'm staying here and hothead cops are gonna come in and
[1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:48.440]  crack their skulls and it's gonna start exactly as they said if it becomes a
[1:53:48.440 --> 1:53:53.160]  something that's that's overtly brutal look what happened with Katrina I mean
[1:53:53.160 --> 1:53:57.600]  look how it was covered up for so long I mean people forget how for days you know
[1:53:57.600 --> 1:54:02.600]  they kept saying that things were under under control and you know they and then
[1:54:02.600 --> 1:54:08.240]  when it when it came to see seeing how how inefficient and uncaring the
[1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:12.840]  government was the outrage set in I think we're going to see the same kind of
[1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:16.000]  thing happen that was actually a cold-blooded laboratory where they
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  shut off the power in the water jam the police radios cut their lines and the
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:24.600]  local parish in New Orleans had to come with guns and literally at gunpoint take
[1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:29.240]  FEMA off of the command centers that they were hijacking and and and cutting
[1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:32.920]  the lines because FEMA wanted it to be a disaster to get more funds I mean
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:36.280]  that's how cold-blooded these people are and I agree with you now that's what's
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:39.800]  gonna happen here let's talk to Mike in Wyoming you're on the air with Gerald
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:49.040]  Salente hello yes Mike go ahead yeah hi how you guys doing good yeah mr. Salente
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:56.080]  it sounds like to me that you believe that we will avoid the sort of
[1:54:56.080 --> 1:55:01.720]  technocratic orwellian nightmare that a lot of people think may come down the
[1:55:01.720 --> 1:55:09.320]  pipe here is pretty soon it also sounds like you also believe that we will avoid
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:13.920]  a mad max post-apocalyptic type of scenario and we're going to go back to
[1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:18.440]  more of this sort of regionalism you were talking about and and you know
[1:55:18.440 --> 1:55:25.480]  locally community-based you know lifestyle and I guess I'm wondering do
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:31.320]  you see the United States maintaining its territorial integrity you know we're
[1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:36.240]  gonna just you know go into sort of like a factionalism I think we're going to go
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:41.080]  into a factionalism and again you know the mad max scenario and the techno
[1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:45.760]  takeover they may happen you know we're not ruling that out completely but what
[1:55:45.760 --> 1:55:50.080]  we're saying for instance on the techno level is that you know did that there's
[1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:53.640]  too many independent people out there that are more skilled tech
[1:55:53.640 --> 1:55:58.440]  technologically than than the government people are in a lot of ways and
[1:55:58.440 --> 1:56:02.440]  they're more of them that could that could break down the systems of control
[1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:08.400]  and that's a possibility the the mad max it may turn into that in different
[1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:12.840]  parts of the country it may look like by the way the globalists have said they
[1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:16.600]  would like to use the crisis to break the country up so we have to watch out for
[1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:20.960]  false revolutions and false revolutionary leaders that actually call for that I do
[1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:24.520]  not want to break the United States up they've got top Russian people
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:27.960]  projecting that that's going to happen the Pentagon's protecting that could
[1:56:27.960 --> 1:56:32.640]  happen we don't want to let the US be broken up like China was 150 years ago
[1:56:32.640 --> 1:56:36.880]  by the European powers Gerald you agree I think we're gonna look more like when
[1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:43.280]  Russia broke up after communism more where the state start ruling themselves
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:48.160]  again there's still a central government but it implodes all right stay there
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:54.080]  final segment with Gerald Salente back in 70 seconds stay with us

[1:57:32.600 --> 1:57:38.720]  spying in and on the US I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:43.320]  in Laden's connections to the CIA the hijackers ties to the FBI the Saudi

[2:00:12.880 --> 2:00:16.120]  officials of the people fail to do the bidding on behalf of the people the
[2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:19.840]  people must mobilize Gerald I have a question for you have you done any
[2:00:19.840 --> 2:00:24.280]  trending on the mass acceleration and growth of the Patriot movement groups
[2:00:24.280 --> 2:00:29.400]  and the role they will play out in the future not on that particularly as I
[2:00:29.400 --> 2:00:33.040]  said what we have been looking at closely are these secessionist movements
[2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:38.000]  and we see those growing as well the people won't be mobilized until it
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:41.600]  hurts them in their pocketbook their heart their cold and their hungry yeah
[2:00:41.600 --> 2:00:45.240]  when their stomachs are empty look out appreciate the call moving fast Ron in
[2:00:45.240 --> 2:00:48.920]  Arizona you're on the air with Gerald Salenta go ahead
[2:00:48.920 --> 2:00:54.960]  Gerald good afternoon Gerald and Alex and your two million listeners I believe
[2:00:54.960 --> 2:01:00.760]  that the New World Order gang is putting clues into movies about future false
[2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:07.400]  flags I'll give you two examples 1996 the movie enemy of the state the
[2:01:07.400 --> 2:01:13.960]  character play by Gene Hackman hacks into the NSA database to find the info
[2:01:13.960 --> 2:01:19.480]  on John Boyd and his birthdays 9-11 and Fox ran the lone government where the
[2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:22.120]  government hijacks planes applied in the World Trade Center for martial law
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:25.920]  and attack Afghanistan six months before and the long kiss goodnight with the
[2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:29.600]  government bombs the World Trade Center in 93 and then and then wants to bomb it
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:33.240]  again for martial law yeah hundreds of it Gerald why do they put this in movies
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:37.600]  we know there's propaganda placement by the government in media why do we see
[2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:42.780]  them loving to flaunt what they're gonna do beforehand well you know I I would
[2:01:42.780 --> 2:01:48.000]  assume and I don't know you know but I would say to get the people prepared for
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.800]  it get prepared for the worst so so when somebody relates to a Mad Max they
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:57.680]  know what it looks like and see how ugly how ugly it is so you know again
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:02:02.480]  look what the movies did during the World War two I mean you know the
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:07.000]  propaganda money you know not negative propaganda maybe some yes maybe no
[2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:11.840]  notice there was all this war propaganda right before 9-11 all these big movies
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:17.560]  go ahead yeah no as I said you know 9-11 came as no surprise to us we had we've
[2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:22.080]  been predicting a major terrorist strike against the United States so again
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:29.760]  though but I don't think that that's the major the major flag and people
[2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:35.000]  forget things as well when there's chaos anything that they did before to
[2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:39.280]  control people it really all breaks down immediately absolutely well we're going
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:42.840]  into very interesting times thank you Ron sorry the other callers you can hold
[2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:47.080]  and talk to our next guest if you like Gerald Salente thank you for spending so

[2:02:59.360 --> 2:03:03.400]  goes Gerald Salente don't forget I'm Alex Jones live here Monday through
[2:03:03.400 --> 2:03:06.520]  Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. even if you don't have a local Amor FM in your
[2:03:06.520 --> 2:03:10.440]  area you can always listen for free at info wars.com and the daily free
[2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:16.480]  podcast at info wars.com hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a
[2:03:16.480 --> 2:03:19.560]  long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[2:03:19.560 --> 2:03:23.040]  important than ever we need to be independent and food and water is the
[2:03:23.040 --> 2:03:26.240]  key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:29.800]  you'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your
[2:03:29.800 --> 2:03:33.720]  family in any emergency if you simply prepare our elected representatives
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:37.160]  wanted a good old boy bailout for special interest so they ignored your
[2:03:37.160 --> 2:03:41.040]  screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print
[2:03:41.040 --> 2:03:44.840]  eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now
[2:03:44.840 --> 2:03:48.600]  owns the American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:52.440]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:57.240]  necessities particularly food beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:01.200]  super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it
[2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:05.600]  reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:09.480]  seems as if there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:12.680]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:16.360]  shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to stay in business
[2:04:16.360 --> 2:04:20.480]  whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and be ready everything is
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:24.440]  zeroing it on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying food and
[2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:28.440]  paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:32.080]  self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very important
[2:04:32.080 --> 2:04:35.240]  for you understand that by having a supply of storeable food the government
[2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:38.720]  the new-old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:42.200]  mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take
[2:04:42.200 --> 2:04:46.280]  care of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is

[2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:09.040]  prison planet TV streaming over the web for prison planet TV members going out
[2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:13.040]  on course on the free streams and info wars.com audio wise and summer cast on
[2:06:13.040 --> 2:06:17.680]  global shortwave and over 70 AM and FM affiliates as well as satellite and
[2:06:17.680 --> 2:06:21.040]  answer a few questions we're beta testing the studio right now we're also
[2:06:21.040 --> 2:06:24.720]  building a TV studio here in the building you know it took us a couple
[2:06:24.720 --> 2:06:27.600]  months to find a building when I announced I was gonna do this six months
[2:06:27.600 --> 2:06:31.920]  ago then a few months to get moved in build the studios we're almost done
[2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:38.200]  with that then we are going to start editing it down to I believe two
[2:06:38.200 --> 2:06:42.120]  different TV shows a week one in here radio style with the highlights of the
[2:06:42.120 --> 2:06:45.080]  guests and information we cover here throughout the week and then another one
[2:06:45.080 --> 2:06:49.920]  in there in the main TV studio and that'll take us a few months to get that
[2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:53.600]  home down and then start editing those and putting them together for air on
[2:06:53.600 --> 2:06:57.400]  dish network or direct TV we're talking to both groups about the best channel to
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:07:01.200]  air it on and the least expensive price obviously we're gonna have to be paying
[2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:06.800]  for that but it's inexpensive compared to what some people might have thought so
[2:07:06.800 --> 2:07:11.760]  we're developing all of this and that is what is unfolding right now this is our
[2:07:11.760 --> 2:07:18.720]  third official transmission out of the studios and three and a half years ago
[2:07:18.720 --> 2:07:24.520]  when I moved into my old tiny you know pocket studio office of about 2,500
[2:07:24.520 --> 2:07:28.440]  square feet with about 10 people in it we're now in an 8,000 square foot building
[2:07:28.440 --> 2:07:34.080]  the first guy who was our guest in studio was Tex Mars and then we just now
[2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:38.640]  noticed we had put two and two together that our first guest in the new studio
[2:07:38.640 --> 2:07:41.840]  so he's kind of like the bottle of champagne we bash on the front of the
[2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:46.760]  ship we have Tex by a rope swinging him into the new studio and so for the next
[2:07:46.760 --> 2:07:50.600]  hour and 50 minutes we are joined in studio to talk about a host of issues my
[2:07:50.600 --> 2:07:54.000]  good buddy Tex Mars Tex good to see you here with us hey Alex it's great to be
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:59.560]  with you in the studio too you know it's important you're the only one out

[2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:27.600]  truthful and we're not gonna cut any corners and we're not gonna say well we
[2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:32.560]  better not say this will get somebody angry at us or or we'll get audited or
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:38.440]  whatever whatever is the case I am ready to pull out all the stops now and let
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:42.280]  me tell you I'm known as a pretty nice guy but but I'm pretty angry I'm
[2:08:42.280 --> 2:08:48.200]  frustrated and I'm upset and I want to save America and I want to save our
[2:08:48.200 --> 2:08:51.960]  Constitution and we've got to do something and if I if I sound like an
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:57.160]  angry man well I am but I'm angry because I'm I'm indignant well seeing the
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:09:00.480]  destruction of your beloved Republic you know you were an Air Force officer
[2:09:00.480 --> 2:09:04.200]  Patriot and like everybody else you love this country and you've been telling
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:08.080]  people the systematic destruction and now we see this group of scam artists run
[2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:12.400]  by people like Maddof stealing tens of trillions of dollars and they are saying
[2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:16.240]  if we don't like it they'll just sick the military on us well they are they're
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:20.880]  gonna sick the military on us that that is their plan that's why they got US
[2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:25.480]  Army forces now stationed in America that have you know they're not just ready
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:29.000]  they're not using it as the staging grounds of preparation like we've done
[2:09:29.000 --> 2:09:34.240]  for over 200 years but they're ready to take on the American people now and they
[2:09:34.240 --> 2:09:38.740]  believe they believe there's going to be a significant number of American
[2:09:38.740 --> 2:09:44.400]  citizens angry enough to take up arms just like is happening now in Greece and
[2:09:44.400 --> 2:09:48.320]  in some other areas of the world now I believe we have to be smart about what
[2:09:48.320 --> 2:09:53.320]  we do things and not fall into the ditch here but the first thing to do is to
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:58.160]  educate people they've got to know what is really going on in Alex listen this
[2:09:58.160 --> 2:10:04.840]  is engineered chaos engineered chaos this isn't something that just suddenly
[2:10:04.840 --> 2:10:10.000]  happened it wasn't just a few banks Citibank Bear Stearns Lehman Brothers
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:16.560]  this is an engineered event they are in reinventing the world they're
[2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:22.760]  regenerating a Leninist Marxist paradise and we're going to be the victims
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:27.280]  this is what happened during the French Revolution with the Illuminati it's what
[2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:33.560]  happened in the in Russia with the Sovietization this is the Sovietization
[2:10:33.560 --> 2:10:40.360]  of America if you read 1984 by Orwell if you read Gulag archipelago by
[2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:45.600]  souls and needson this is it we're in the midst of it and I believe we're only
[2:10:45.600 --> 2:10:50.760]  about nine months from a total collapse of the economy and listen I did a
[2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:59.120]  program on my own shortwave frequency yesterday and I entitled it I smell war
[2:10:59.120 --> 2:11:09.040]  and there is a a specter that looms now Alex of a savage 2009 2010 so we're
[2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:15.000]  facing a great war we're facing bloodshed and death and we're facing the end of
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:21.280]  American sovereignty and all of these things are interrelated at once well I
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:25.520]  want to be nuanced about this people hear us talk about international
[2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:28.240]  communist conspiracies Marxist Leninist you know
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:32.280]  Sovietization they think of Russia they don't understand that the big New York
[2:11:32.280 --> 2:11:37.000]  and London banks want to enslave the population and they call feudalism
[2:11:37.000 --> 2:11:41.480]  communism saying it's a workers paradise when it's really giant death camps and
[2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:45.320]  and GRU arresting people and they don't understand that it was in the New
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:48.280]  York Times in the 30s when they thought the public wanted it they were going to
[2:11:48.280 --> 2:11:52.160]  merge Russia in the United States and bring in this big socialist system run
[2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:56.960]  by the central banks they socialize with medicine and your payment and your
[2:11:56.960 --> 2:12:02.560]  labor so they have full control over you so there's no private property in the
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:06.960]  general public's hands only in the hands of the super elite so so this isn't the
[2:12:06.960 --> 2:12:13.760]  classic communist conspiracy that's why people like McCarthy were useful until
[2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:17.920]  he found out all the armies running communism all the CFR and then they
[2:12:17.920 --> 2:12:21.960]  then they shut him down when it was just a communist conspiracy they liked him
[2:12:21.960 --> 2:12:25.160]  because it was being used to destroy the First Amendment and go after Americans
[2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:28.600]  and go after the left but as soon as he found out wait a minute banks are
[2:12:28.600 --> 2:12:32.680]  funding this which is now come out was totally true means now mainstream news
[2:12:32.680 --> 2:12:39.720]  that Mao was put in in 49 by the CIA sure and Warburg and the other Wall Street
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:49.040]  bankers sent Leon Bronstein renamed him a Trotsky and sent him linen into Moscow
[2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:54.520]  and to Russia in 1917 to lead a revolution so what I want people to
[2:12:54.520 --> 2:12:59.400]  understand is this you know Time Magazine just made Barack Obama man of the
[2:12:59.400 --> 2:13:02.880]  year person of the years they call it now but there was an interesting statement
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:07.400]  and inside the magazine and all of their hero worship calling him almost the new
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:13.560]  Messiah they basically said there is no such thing now as a Republican Party or
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:19.840]  a Democrat Party there's only Obama now this is what happened back in Nazi
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:24.840]  Germany you see they had political parties they had elections and suddenly
[2:13:24.840 --> 2:13:30.360]  there were no political parties there was only Hitler the same thing goes for
[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:35.160]  the Duma the Parliament of Russia you know they had political parties they
[2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:41.160]  had candidates for the Duma as well as the Tsar but suddenly there was only
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:46.160]  Vladimir Lenin so we've got a situation here what I want people to know is this
[2:13:46.160 --> 2:13:51.640]  this is a very interesting thing there is the Hegelian dialectic process that
[2:13:51.640 --> 2:13:56.560]  has been going on now for a hundred years but it's been escalating in our
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:14:01.520]  generation and Alex listen to this you said this is not classical communism
[2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:06.080]  you know I was I was making some notes and I and I looked at it and I let me
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:10.720]  explain something to people the the Illuminati elite the Wall Street
[2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:16.080]  bankers and their friends they are very flexible they are pragmatic and they
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:24.120]  have experimented for decades okay this entire century on how they can bring
[2:14:24.120 --> 2:14:30.880]  this process to its final conclusion Orto of KO that's the 33rd degree a
[2:14:30.880 --> 2:14:35.720]  Freemasonry look at the systems that they're using they use Masonism they
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:42.040]  use Zionism they use Nazism they use capitalism but it's an unbridled
[2:14:42.040 --> 2:14:48.040]  cartelism basically gay monopoly monopoly monopolistic they use fascism they
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:52.320]  use socialism but they they give it the euphemism of democracy anything that has
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:55.080]  vertical integration absolutely the isms are there
[2:14:55.080 --> 2:15:00.440]  Jesuitism but but basically that they have they have put all of these systems
[2:15:00.440 --> 2:15:06.040]  together even the classical communism of Lenin Trotsky and Marx they have put all
[2:15:06.040 --> 2:15:11.840]  these things in an entirely new form okay an entirely new form to create a
[2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:16.560]  global new world order I can only really best frame it and call it neo
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:21.680]  fascism by the way of course even conservatism was perverted and turned
[2:15:21.680 --> 2:15:27.160]  into neo conservatism but what they did is before they the British Empire created
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:30.720]  all these fake political terms they could give us false choices where they
[2:15:30.720 --> 2:15:35.880]  controlled like a sock puppet every one of the Little Apparition or the the
[2:15:35.880 --> 2:15:42.600]  Little Mechanisms before it was just liberty versus tyranny it was property
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:48.000]  rights and local control and elected councils and grand juries in our common
[2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:53.080]  law system and then it wasn't liberal or conservative so so they came in and
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:15:59.400]  created a whole false new vocabulary to confuse the whole issue well they did
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:03.200]  you know Rockefeller if you look back at Rockefeller who found a standard oil
[2:16:03.200 --> 2:16:08.760]  and really had a monopoly in the oil business back at the beginning of the
[2:16:08.760 --> 2:16:13.880]  20th century people call him a capitalist but but he was not going to
[2:16:13.880 --> 2:16:19.280]  broke any opposition he didn't want any other oil companies to be formed he
[2:16:19.280 --> 2:16:26.000]  wanted a total monopoly of standard oil company so so what we have here is not
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:31.480]  capitalism it's it's not the opposite it's not communism it's some kind of a
[2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:37.440]  of a hydra-headed monster and I want to just say let's just call it neo because
[2:16:37.440 --> 2:16:42.640]  it's new it's an entire new thing neo fascism now what they neo control
[2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:47.560]  frikism well neo dehumanization or two things technological enslavement
[2:16:47.560 --> 2:16:50.200]  grid that's right there are two things though we have to understand they
[2:16:50.200 --> 2:16:57.000]  oppose that we must be for because they're the only sane alternative for you
[2:16:57.000 --> 2:16:59.720]  and I and all our lists all right text we got a break let's come back with those
[2:16:59.720 --> 2:17:05.360]  two key things that they oppose right here on the GCN radio network and your

[2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:35.840]  world government is upon us the enemy is sending up problems and hundreds of the
[2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:39.760]  most prestigious papers from Japan to Germany to England the United States
[2:21:39.760 --> 2:21:43.040]  Australia they're saying world government is the answer to the world
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:47.320]  crisis when publicly the very central banks that are announcing they're going
[2:21:47.320 --> 2:21:51.000]  to be world government are the ones that engineered all of this professor of
[2:21:51.000 --> 2:21:56.680]  space and aeronautics former Air Force captain best-selling author many times
[2:21:56.680 --> 2:22:01.280]  over New York Times bestseller Tex Mars is with us and we'll go over some of his
[2:22:01.280 --> 2:22:05.720]  books and websites as well and take your phone calls so Texas is not classical
[2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:11.240]  communism this is a integration and a mix of all of these systems please
[2:22:11.240 --> 2:22:15.080]  continue with the two things they're attacking that we have to stand for it
[2:22:15.080 --> 2:22:19.760]  can be confusing if people you see they won't us to fight they want the left to
[2:22:19.760 --> 2:22:24.880]  fight the right wing and they want the Republicans versus the Democrats they
[2:22:24.880 --> 2:22:29.920]  won't working people versus the more wealthy this is what they do they break
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:35.040]  us into these little groups you see and and there is planned chaos there's plan
[2:22:35.040 --> 2:22:42.240]  dissension there's always friction in this Hegelian dialectic process and what
[2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:48.760]  what it should be called really is the alchemical processing of humanity they
[2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:53.680]  are reinventing the United States and the world now the first thing to do Alex
[2:22:53.680 --> 2:23:00.640]  okay this is this is literally been been been carefully engineered and planned
[2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:07.640]  meticulously first you must destabilize and destructure the world all right in
[2:23:07.640 --> 2:23:11.440]  other words you've got to push Humpty Dumpty off the wall you got to crack the
[2:23:11.440 --> 2:23:18.360]  egg and after it's cracked okay and you've got chaos then you can put Humpty
[2:23:18.360 --> 2:23:22.280]  Dumpty packed together again now the two things that I wanted to mention to
[2:23:22.280 --> 2:23:27.400]  people that are the enemy of the Illuminati elite first is individualism
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:32.880]  the right for you to be you an individual they hate that they're
[2:23:32.880 --> 2:23:38.320]  collectivist the and this is true of a national socialism which is what Nazis
[2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:46.640]  were it is was true of communism they hate individualism you to be you now the
[2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:50.880]  second thing they hate is personal freedom to be an individual and our
[2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:56.880]  Constitution you see provided for these things originally for the individual to
[2:23:56.880 --> 2:24:03.360]  have personal freedom and for the state to be unable to strip it from us so it's
[2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:07.120]  necessary for these people to totally destabilize
[2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:13.120]  destructure destroy America the entire American system and a way of thinking and
[2:24:13.120 --> 2:24:16.520]  I want to go back to the key giving us false choices instead of a debate of
[2:24:16.520 --> 2:24:20.640]  liberty versus tyranny right freedom versus slavery they make it well you
[2:24:20.640 --> 2:24:25.400]  can have the republican fascism you can have the Obama socialism communism but
[2:24:25.400 --> 2:24:29.000]  when you study the two face-scanning cameras police and black scheme ask
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:33.840]  high levels of taxes juries being abolished from Russia to England to
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:37.120]  Canada they're trying to get rid of them it's all the same system and even in
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:42.840]  Russia and in Japan or in Australia or the US the social service programs all
[2:24:42.840 --> 2:24:48.960]  have even the same names we just just have gone through a ridiculous two-year
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:54.840]  election process what did we end up with Obama who was supposedly according to
[2:24:54.840 --> 2:24:59.440]  the media at loggerheads with Hillary Rodham Clinton appointing her as
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:03.880]  Secretary of State what did we have a man who said I'll get you out of the
[2:25:03.880 --> 2:25:10.120]  Iraq war appointing George W. Bush's Secretary of Defense to be his
[2:25:10.120 --> 2:25:17.320]  Secretary of Defense the the old guard is still the new guard there is no change
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:21.040]  whatsoever there will never be with the Illuminati elite that are now
[2:25:21.040 --> 2:25:25.840]  controlling America now Alex what I want people to understand is this is planned
[2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:29.760]  it's an engineered chaos you know Gorbachev is one of these people
[2:25:29.760 --> 2:25:35.960]  Gorbachev the guy that supposedly brought glasnost and freedom to Russia but
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:41.720]  wait you know I've read Gorbachev's book perestroika perestroika is a Russian
[2:25:41.720 --> 2:25:49.320]  word meaning a new way of thinking in fact a revision it's the it's the repair
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:53.680]  of the world but first you must break something before you can fix it now
[2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:57.040]  that's alien to our way of thinking you say that's why we hear under the new
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:01.320]  environmental laws they're saying the old way is going away you're gonna have
[2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:05.640]  to have austerity right you're gonna have to have feudalism the change is we
[2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:11.720]  are going to lose our free market and and Obama's right we are the change and
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:16.640]  we are the change he expects us he is going to demand sacrifice from every
[2:26:16.640 --> 2:26:22.640]  American everyone in the world and we are going to make the changes okay under
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:28.000]  his messiah leadership now Obama of course and rom the cruel that's what I
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:33.600]  call him that's a good name for him rom the cruel Emmanuel are the two chosen
[2:26:33.600 --> 2:26:40.320]  saviors of the world and they are the really the working engineers they are
[2:26:40.320 --> 2:26:44.800]  up in the engine room of the train driving this thing but they have others
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:50.160]  more powerful than them behind the scenes but I want people to understand in
[2:26:50.160 --> 2:26:56.600]  the the Jewish cabala they have a a term for this it's called tikkun olam tikkun
[2:26:56.600 --> 2:26:59.680]  olam all right stay there stay there text we've got a break we're gonna come
[2:26:59.680 --> 2:27:03.480]  back and get into all of that with our guest text Mars in studio and take your
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:09.600]  calls at 1-800-259-9031 also want to get into how he sees all this breaking down
[2:27:09.600 --> 2:27:17.160]  and unfolding stay with us we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:24.680]  and the GCN radio network doctors around the world claim that cancer and other
[2:27:24.680 --> 2:27:29.120]  diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment but as you know most
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:33.920]  people are overly acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise pH
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:37.440]  balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well
[2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:41.560]  as prevention of disease people who alkalized the water they drink experience
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:45.760]  normalized blood sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for
[2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:49.880]  human beings to drink alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people
[2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:54.080]  are overly acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline
[2:27:54.080 --> 2:27:57.840]  environment fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular
[2:27:57.840 --> 2:28:02.600]  basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body

[2:30:49.660 --> 2:30:55.860]  let it all hang out cause we got a run to make the boys are first taking Atlanta and there's
[2:30:55.860 --> 2:31:05.300]  our guest in studio here in Austin Texas we're going into very horrific times the
[2:31:05.300 --> 2:31:10.580]  Neural Order crowd that gave you Nazism, Communism, publicly funded, the Maoist
[2:31:10.580 --> 2:31:14.940]  they are now looking to break down the United States to re-engineer it and
[2:31:14.940 --> 2:31:18.740]  break the back of the American people the people of the West to teach us to love
[2:31:18.740 --> 2:31:23.700]  world government it's just asinine to have the mainstream you know mainline
[2:31:23.700 --> 2:31:26.860]  media telling us the bankers are going to save us when they're the ones that
[2:31:26.860 --> 2:31:30.220]  have engineered this and openly saying world government of and by the
[2:31:30.220 --> 2:31:33.660]  international banking cartels now Texas we got cut off by the break you are
[2:31:33.660 --> 2:31:38.100]  getting into a form of cabala that speaks of this fusion and then let's get
[2:31:38.100 --> 2:31:41.820]  into what this is going to look like how this is going to unfold and how we fight
[2:31:41.820 --> 2:31:47.020]  back against it because it's going to be as unpopular as you know jumping off a
[2:31:47.020 --> 2:31:49.500]  cliff with people and I don't think it's going to go the same way it did in
[2:31:49.500 --> 2:31:54.140]  China or Russia because we have a history of rebellion and we are armed and we
[2:31:54.140 --> 2:31:59.100]  still have our Protestant ethic okay it's going to be a process this
[2:31:59.100 --> 2:32:05.340]  alchemical processing of humanity pressing them into this new world order
[2:32:05.340 --> 2:32:10.980]  yes the the Jewish cabala of course has its system called tikkun olam they're
[2:32:10.980 --> 2:32:16.300]  they're creating reinventing the world and pressing it into a new Zionist
[2:32:16.300 --> 2:32:21.340]  paradise at the same time though the commonest the socialist as Gorbachev
[2:32:21.340 --> 2:32:26.260]  expressed in his book perestroika they're also bringing forth this same
[2:32:26.260 --> 2:32:30.580]  thing now if you go back to the French Revolution they talked about change
[2:32:30.580 --> 2:32:35.500]  constantly change was the catchword for the Illuminati who brought out the
[2:32:35.500 --> 2:32:41.100]  guillotine and actually intended to massacre to have genocide of almost
[2:32:41.100 --> 2:32:45.500]  the mass population of France and the whole world and they said they kept
[2:32:45.500 --> 2:32:48.780]  saying perpetually that was a false revolution they admitted it was an
[2:32:48.780 --> 2:32:52.340]  occult they wanted a 10-day work week they openly wanted to worship occult
[2:32:52.340 --> 2:32:57.980]  environmentalism the whole bit going back to nature they claim and they
[2:32:57.980 --> 2:33:04.340]  kept saying we will reinvent the world but first we must destroy the world you
[2:33:04.340 --> 2:33:10.220]  must destroy at first destabilize destructure bring men back to a state
[2:33:10.220 --> 2:33:14.980]  of nature and then you can build them now Alex I you have studied this for
[2:33:14.980 --> 2:33:21.420]  years what what has happened in the CIA the Mossad the Canadian intelligent
[2:33:21.420 --> 2:33:26.740]  services this this MK ultra program the monarch program okay what they attempted
[2:33:26.740 --> 2:33:34.660]  to do with some moderate success was to use a means okay a processing did they
[2:33:34.660 --> 2:33:41.380]  not torture people did they not put them in sensory deprivation tanks they use
[2:33:41.380 --> 2:33:46.820]  shock treatment literally electric shock treatment they use torture they used
[2:33:46.820 --> 2:33:51.300]  women they would rape them they would beat people they broke down their minds
[2:33:51.300 --> 2:33:55.820]  and what they said was these these you know a doctor you and Cameron and these
[2:33:55.820 --> 2:34:02.300]  other CIA psychiatrist these monsters these terror people who were doing this
[2:34:02.300 --> 2:34:09.020]  and in these these secret psychological program all the associated press admitted
[2:34:09.020 --> 2:34:13.340]  that camp x-ray wasn't even really one of the real camps the black sites the
[2:34:13.340 --> 2:34:16.780]  ghost sites are in Europe and Eastern Europe and the Middle East of all
[2:34:16.780 --> 2:34:21.900]  places they said that it was a laboratory for interrogation and they
[2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:26.100]  would have the women come in menstruating and rape them in they would
[2:34:26.100 --> 2:34:30.020]  do satanic ceremonies was in the news oh yeah but they said just to freak out the
[2:34:30.020 --> 2:34:34.580]  Muslims no this is what they like why would they rape children according to
[2:34:34.580 --> 2:34:38.500]  general to goomba's own army report us army report they would rape people with
[2:34:38.500 --> 2:34:42.460]  large objects dripping with acid they would torture their children in front
[2:34:42.460 --> 2:34:48.180]  of them again this is about creating these wicked murdering cadres that's
[2:34:48.180 --> 2:34:51.740]  why they wouldn't take real al-qaeda al-syaa to the camps they would take
[2:34:51.740 --> 2:34:55.420]  young people innocent people from Iraq and Afghanistan and Europe in the US
[2:34:55.420 --> 2:35:01.420]  there because it was really about testing and creating these cadres that's why
[2:35:01.420 --> 2:35:05.020]  they brought innocent people there to be tortured and this has been a process
[2:35:05.020 --> 2:35:11.860]  especially since 1949 you know we can go back to Vietnam they had Operation
[2:35:11.860 --> 2:35:17.500]  Phoenix they put prisoners in in tiger cages and tortured them and so forth
[2:35:17.500 --> 2:35:23.700]  I hear here is the reason for this it was theorized by the CIA psychiatrist that
[2:35:23.700 --> 2:35:28.860]  they could create Manchurian candidates they could create really mind controlled
[2:35:28.860 --> 2:35:35.700]  slaves by first destroying a person's mind and after they destroyed the mind
[2:35:35.700 --> 2:35:40.140]  then they could build it back piece by piece and this is all declassified what
[2:35:40.140 --> 2:35:43.740]  you're saying came out congressional hearings with jolly in west and and
[2:35:43.740 --> 2:35:47.820]  Ewing Cameron and they would grab foster children in the US and be able with
[2:35:47.820 --> 2:35:52.100]  PCP and LSD and shock therapy within a year to create a complete mind control
[2:35:52.100 --> 2:35:56.020]  slave that's right now what they did then was to first destroy the mind now keep
[2:35:56.020 --> 2:36:01.420]  that in mind and then they would build the person back again a personality that
[2:36:01.420 --> 2:36:06.660]  they could control a mind control slave the Germans to the Germans 200 years
[2:36:06.660 --> 2:36:10.220]  ago when Prussia first developed this in the modern sense with the shaving the
[2:36:10.220 --> 2:36:15.060]  head sleep deprivation of the troops the goose stepping which is very painful
[2:36:15.060 --> 2:36:18.940]  long distances to literally break them down into automaton so that's another
[2:36:18.940 --> 2:36:22.860]  form of mind control now I want you to think of this they first did this to the
[2:36:22.860 --> 2:36:29.460]  individual now now we have the application okay we have the application
[2:36:29.460 --> 2:36:34.620]  to the entire world and to the United States mass mind control mass my whole
[2:36:34.620 --> 2:36:39.860]  world is a prison it is it is a form of shock therapy how do you shock people
[2:36:39.860 --> 2:36:43.180]  into a new system that's what the IMF calls its economic reforms that that's
[2:36:43.180 --> 2:36:47.820]  right shock therapy shock therapy first they did it with individuals so so now
[2:36:47.820 --> 2:36:50.460]  they're going to do it with the United States what must happen to the United
[2:36:50.460 --> 2:36:57.060]  States it must be broken down it must be disorganized destructured destabilized
[2:36:57.060 --> 2:37:02.220]  people must be totally brought down to third world status and they must become
[2:37:02.220 --> 2:37:06.140]  desperate now remember what Vicente Fox said on the Larry King show the former
[2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:10.700]  president of Mexico a person called in and said hey are we really going to have
[2:37:10.700 --> 2:37:14.980]  a North American Union and an Amaro are we going to bring these three countries
[2:37:14.980 --> 2:37:19.980]  together are we going to get rid of the US greenback and and and Vicente Fox
[2:37:19.980 --> 2:37:25.620]  said yes that's a little bit later but that's coming now Larry King on CNN said
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:29.220]  to President Fox he says well do you think the American people will really
[2:37:29.220 --> 2:37:34.140]  stand for that what was Fox's response this was only a year ago or so year and
[2:37:34.140 --> 2:37:38.980]  a half ago Fox who's part of this whole process the Illuminati Network Vicente
[2:37:38.980 --> 2:37:43.860]  Fox said this oh well right now they wouldn't stand for it but wait in a few
[2:37:43.860 --> 2:37:51.120]  years they'll be crying out for the Amaro from their economic misery they'll
[2:37:51.120 --> 2:37:56.860]  be crying out for it first they must be broken down they must be destructured
[2:37:56.860 --> 2:38:01.580]  and destabilized now this is what they've done to Iraq they never meant to
[2:38:01.580 --> 2:38:06.020]  rebuild Iraq again they were tearing it down to bring it down to forced
[2:38:06.020 --> 2:38:11.420]  inoculation CPS only GMO food crops are allowed to be planted under law they're
[2:38:11.420 --> 2:38:14.460]  making it into the modern system same thing with Serbia bombing and
[2:38:14.460 --> 2:38:18.060]  overthrowing it same thing with Afghanistan and now America is the big
[2:38:18.060 --> 2:38:22.100]  target now it's our turn everything we've seen with the police state so far
[2:38:22.100 --> 2:38:26.420]  and the breaking up of the families was only preparatory to put the capstone on
[2:38:26.420 --> 2:38:30.740]  and the capstone is mass murder FEMA camps starvation that's why they're
[2:38:30.740 --> 2:38:34.460]  bringing in this mega crisis now I want to get into where this mega crisis is
[2:38:34.460 --> 2:38:37.660]  going with you text I totally agree with your excellent analysis that you're
[2:38:37.660 --> 2:38:43.060]  even you know expanding on here I want to go back because you know I come on
[2:38:43.060 --> 2:38:45.700]  air and I criticize Israel for the horrible corrupt things they do and I
[2:38:45.700 --> 2:38:49.500]  also criticize Egypt and Germany and England and Russia because all these
[2:38:49.500 --> 2:38:54.340]  countries are run by the same wicked mindset and system how do you how do we
[2:38:54.340 --> 2:38:58.820]  explain to people that you know the top prince Philip and Prince Bernhard
[2:38:58.820 --> 2:39:03.500]  were our Nazis they hate black people then their writings you know they hate
[2:39:03.500 --> 2:39:10.420]  Jews but and then we have made off you're formally running the stock exchange
[2:39:10.420 --> 2:39:15.820]  in New York ripping off mainly Jewish charities and he's a Jewish guy and we
[2:39:15.820 --> 2:39:18.460]  always see the Zionist who actually helped put Hitler in power that's now
[2:39:18.460 --> 2:39:22.140]  been declassified in major university books written by Jews are out on it
[2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:25.220]  it's a big deal you know we knew about that decades ago but now it's mainstream
[2:39:25.220 --> 2:39:29.380]  news and where Hitler wanted to let all the Jews out and he was a bad guy but
[2:39:29.380 --> 2:39:32.780]  we're saying he wanted to get them all out and and the Zionist said no make
[2:39:32.780 --> 2:39:36.580]  them pay us a million dollars a piece and only send them to Palestine and so
[2:39:36.580 --> 2:39:40.100]  that's why they lobbied Roosevelt to not let Jews come into America but then
[2:39:40.100 --> 2:39:44.940]  Jews love Roosevelt or we have the Zionist getting billions of dollars
[2:39:44.940 --> 2:39:49.500]  from the US from 53 to 63 for the ringworm children to radiate and kill
[2:39:49.500 --> 2:39:54.860]  the the the Sephardic Jewish children so again it's this fusion when you get to
[2:39:54.860 --> 2:39:57.900]  the top of the New World Order it's weird cabala and I remember you over a
[2:39:57.900 --> 2:40:00.780]  decade ago saying Madonna was doing rituals it was cabalistic he wrote
[2:40:00.780 --> 2:40:04.220]  articles about it in your newsletter and then now she admits oh I've been doing
[2:40:04.220 --> 2:40:07.820]  cabala for decades on stage and she now admits that's what it is you you could
[2:40:07.820 --> 2:40:12.620]  see the ritual but she's not Jewish so so so explain this how do you because my
[2:40:12.620 --> 2:40:16.260]  own research when you get to the highest levels it's the Teutonic Knights it's
[2:40:16.260 --> 2:40:23.060]  this holy grail Merovingian Nazi idea so it's it's that's what Jordan Maxwell
[2:40:23.060 --> 2:40:28.020]  calls the calls it is Nazi Zionist and then Jewish Zionist and you know our
[2:40:28.020 --> 2:40:31.740]  whole society King Solomon the masons you know they're mainly white guys but
[2:40:31.740 --> 2:40:38.020]  that's cabalic so so explaining this is a system not even so much as it is about
[2:40:38.020 --> 2:40:42.460]  the Jews but why do we always see the top Jews actually working to kill and
[2:40:42.460 --> 2:40:48.900]  enslave Jews while posing that they're for Jews many Jews because of the nature
[2:40:48.900 --> 2:40:54.660]  of their culture and their society have basically been trained in these methods
[2:40:54.660 --> 2:40:58.780]  through their their Jewish Talmud through their cabala which is a system of
[2:40:58.780 --> 2:41:02.420]  Jewish magic Albert Pike former sovereign grand commander of free mason
[2:41:02.420 --> 2:41:06.940]  founder of the Klan was a follower well yeah well pike actually was one of the
[2:41:06.940 --> 2:41:11.460]  founders of the clan in his statue by the way honoring Albert Pike founder of
[2:41:11.460 --> 2:41:15.860]  the Ku Klux Klan it stands in front of the U.S. Justice Department building in
[2:41:15.860 --> 2:41:19.540]  Washington D.C. we video check it when we were in DC a few months ago and you
[2:41:19.540 --> 2:41:21.980]  notice amazing you don't hear Jesse Jackson saying take that down oh no
[2:41:21.980 --> 2:41:25.780]  Jesse Jackson's not gonna say this the guy found in the Ku Klux Klan in a
[2:41:25.780 --> 2:41:30.140]  statue is in front of the U.S. Justice Department building but he founds the
[2:41:30.140 --> 2:41:34.660]  clan but he's a cabala follower that's right and he also Solomon's keys he was
[2:41:34.660 --> 2:41:39.300]  also involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln and he fled to Canada
[2:41:39.300 --> 2:41:43.100]  and it was pardoned by a free mason president Andrew Johnson and that was
[2:41:43.100 --> 2:41:47.420]  the reason for his impeachment by the way the first president to be impeached
[2:41:47.420 --> 2:41:51.780]  right after Lincoln was assassinated Andrew Johnson a 33rd degree mason now
[2:41:51.780 --> 2:41:56.460]  you ask about the Jews now what we have to understand is their system is
[2:41:56.460 --> 2:42:00.820]  disposed for this not all the Jews of course there are many a secular Jews
[2:42:00.820 --> 2:42:03.540]  there are many that don't even know what we're talking about so the system I have
[2:42:03.540 --> 2:42:07.100]  about so they should so the system so so so our original foundation of
[2:42:07.100 --> 2:42:11.940]  everything is the Torah the Christian basis our laws that's good they go into
[2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:16.500]  Babylonian cacti captivity so the modern system that the Nazis and everybody
[2:42:16.500 --> 2:42:22.180]  else adopt whether it's Jewish or not is that Babylonian mystery school taken
[2:42:22.180 --> 2:42:25.460]  through the morning is you know I wrote this book mysterious monuments I'm not
[2:42:25.460 --> 2:42:29.100]  I'm not trying to promote my book I hope you do I sell it at info wars.com we need
[2:42:29.100 --> 2:42:32.940]  funding I hope but plus it's a great book people need to get it well here's the
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:37.260]  thing about by the way it's over 600 pages huge format one of the sections in
[2:42:37.260 --> 2:42:42.940]  it is entitled Rothschild's legacy or unholy legacy in the holy land I want
[2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:46.980]  you to think about this Alex you know in the Old Testament God told the Jews
[2:42:46.980 --> 2:42:53.220]  come out of Egypt right but what is what is Egypt what is the architecture that
[2:42:53.220 --> 2:42:56.860]  we see that by the way it's very symbolic and points all the way back to
[2:42:56.860 --> 2:43:02.380]  the ancient mystery religion of Babylon it's pyramids it's obelisk now if you go
[2:43:02.380 --> 2:43:07.060]  to Israel today you will see objects placed there by the Rothschilds the
[2:43:07.060 --> 2:43:12.140]  richest Illuminati dynasty in the world funded Hitler absolutely you will see
[2:43:12.140 --> 2:43:17.620]  for example at Hebrew University right in the courtyard and I have a picture of
[2:43:17.620 --> 2:43:23.940]  it in this book you will see a pyramid if you go to I lot Israel which is you
[2:43:23.940 --> 2:43:28.220]  know when you're coming from Egypt into Israel you enter in they actually have a
[2:43:28.220 --> 2:43:31.460]  boulevard I have a picture of that and again Hitler was into this too so it
[2:43:31.460 --> 2:43:34.780]  doesn't matter all ancient mystery pyramid you have the obelisk we're
[2:43:34.780 --> 2:43:40.740]  saying is the elites follow this no matter what color or surface they're
[2:43:40.740 --> 2:43:46.100]  going to use Zionism as a tool just like they will use Jesuitism of the
[2:43:46.100 --> 2:43:49.580]  Vatican that's what pike said pike said and they will and they will misuse
[2:43:49.580 --> 2:43:55.380]  capitalism okay they will use all these systems you see and and Zionism has
[2:43:55.380 --> 2:44:00.900]  created this system in which they are abusing okay in any any concepts of
[2:44:00.900 --> 2:44:06.020]  holiness that we find in the Old Testament and they will use this then to
[2:44:06.020 --> 2:44:12.660]  grip hold of the head you might say the hair or the scalp of the world so they
[2:44:12.660 --> 2:44:16.900]  will use all of these systems and it is a let's just say it is a the Kabbalah and
[2:44:16.900 --> 2:44:21.260]  the Talmud are very convenient systems here's why here's why because they teach
[2:44:21.260 --> 2:44:26.060]  that the Jews are the superior race that they should not marry these inferior
[2:44:26.060 --> 2:44:32.460]  gore them we they cannot assimilate now why is it that's why is it so sorry why
[2:44:32.460 --> 2:44:36.780]  is it bad when black nationalist or black Israelites say blacks only read with
[2:44:36.780 --> 2:44:41.180]  blacks why is that bad in the media or why when whites say white supremacists
[2:44:41.180 --> 2:44:45.180]  you know we should only marry other whites or you know when there's some
[2:44:45.180 --> 2:44:49.780]  Asian extremists who say we should only marry other Asians why is that all
[2:44:49.780 --> 2:44:53.980]  decried and bad but then our media tells us and never talks about how
[2:44:53.980 --> 2:44:58.660]  proselytizing Christianity is illegal in Israel and they make foreign it was in
[2:44:58.660 --> 2:45:01.940]  the Associated Press for years ago foreign Asian workers in Israel have to
[2:45:01.940 --> 2:45:06.900]  sign a pledge to not date Jewish women oh well of course because for example one
[2:45:06.900 --> 2:45:12.460]  of the so-called charitable education foundations who gave all their money to
[2:45:12.460 --> 2:45:18.460]  Madoff groups like Mortimer Zuckerman who was editor-in-chief of the US News and
[2:45:18.460 --> 2:45:23.820]  War Report you know lost 30 million look at these Jewish so-called charitable 501
[2:45:23.820 --> 2:45:29.140]  C3 education foundations what what kind of education are they involved in they
[2:45:29.140 --> 2:45:33.500]  teach Jewish youth that they are superior race they are God's chosen
[2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:37.700]  whatever they do to the Palestinians the Arabs is okay with God but in fact they
[2:45:37.700 --> 2:45:41.740]  should destroy the Arabs off the face of the earth they teach them that it is
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:47.620]  wrong for them to associate with to for example for their children to marry
[2:45:47.620 --> 2:45:53.180]  Gentiles and if they do they will disown them now these are racist bigoted
[2:45:53.180 --> 2:45:59.180]  organizations I want to say something though if we put this paint on all Jews
[2:45:59.180 --> 2:46:03.980]  are we not falling into the trap of bigotry ourself you see what I'm saying
[2:46:03.980 --> 2:46:08.060]  we have to be very careful here because I'm personally a Christian and what did
[2:46:08.060 --> 2:46:14.460]  Jesus say who so ever will may come who's so ever will that includes every
[2:46:14.460 --> 2:46:20.860]  race on earth so there's an opportunity here for a Jew or any other race to be
[2:46:20.860 --> 2:46:26.060]  a good person to be a humanitarian to be a Christian to be honest with you but
[2:46:26.060 --> 2:46:33.780]  my point is just like Hitler perverted the German nation just like Lenin who by
[2:46:33.780 --> 2:46:38.060]  the way was Jewish and the Lenin Museum you know where his body lies in state
[2:46:38.060 --> 2:46:43.540]  admits now both Lenin and Trotsky were Jews and Solzhenitsyn in his book 200
[2:46:43.540 --> 2:46:48.340]  years together exposed the fact that most of the common doubts of the Soviet
[2:46:48.340 --> 2:46:55.060]  Gulag prison camps were Jews now now why is this I believe they have been
[2:46:55.060 --> 2:47:00.300]  alienated from the nations and they purposely alienated themselves because
[2:47:00.300 --> 2:47:04.060]  they said we're superior and we will not be involved for example let's take
[2:47:04.060 --> 2:47:10.180]  Rom the cruel Emmanuel the first Persian Gulf War came about he wanted to be
[2:47:10.180 --> 2:47:14.860]  patriotic Rom you want to join the IDF well yeah well he wanted to be
[2:47:14.860 --> 2:47:20.420]  patriotic he was he was you know given all these great things here in America
[2:47:20.420 --> 2:47:24.900]  right even finally became a congressman he was paid over 17 million dollars for
[2:47:24.900 --> 2:47:30.140]  two years work on Wall Street with the Wasserstein group now he's going to be
[2:47:30.140 --> 2:47:33.900]  the White House Chief of Staff under Barack Obama he wanted to be patriotic
[2:47:33.900 --> 2:47:38.980]  all right to Israel and he went over there and joined the Israeli Defense
[2:47:38.980 --> 2:47:45.500]  Forces the Israeli military he wasn't patriotic to America he is a citizen of
[2:47:45.500 --> 2:47:50.740]  the nation of Israel what is he doing as White House Chief of Staff and by the
[2:47:50.740 --> 2:47:55.740]  way what we have in the United States I want people to understand this Obama and
[2:47:55.740 --> 2:48:03.500]  Rom the cruel Emmanuel are two servants are stooges of a Jewish mafia that's
[2:48:03.500 --> 2:48:07.540]  what Chicago is all about that's what Lagoya bitch was about listen even Dick
[2:48:07.540 --> 2:48:14.700]  Morris who is Jewish himself by the way exposed the fact that it was Obama and
[2:48:14.700 --> 2:48:19.780]  Rom Emmanuel who recruited Lagoya bitch I know and in Illinois say there we got
[2:48:19.780 --> 2:48:26.140]  right now the governor silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic this

[2:49:53.300 --> 2:49:58.300]  some Israeli citizens have been detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the

[2:51:48.140 --> 2:51:51.260]  going why you think they're now announcing yes it's a world government
[2:51:51.260 --> 2:51:54.980]  yes tyranny's good and the Financial Times of London I mean actually saying
[2:51:54.980 --> 2:52:01.140]  that this is amazing and where this whole neo-fascist system now as you were
[2:52:01.140 --> 2:52:07.100]  saying is going well well first of all people have to understand again that this
[2:52:07.100 --> 2:52:12.060]  is engineered chaos and and the first thing that they're they're doing is to
[2:52:12.060 --> 2:52:16.940]  destabilize and to destructure the United States of America we're the
[2:52:16.940 --> 2:52:20.940]  linchpin for the whole world so what happens here is going to reverberate
[2:52:20.940 --> 2:52:25.900]  across this globe now the first thing they started out with and by the way
[2:52:25.900 --> 2:52:30.420]  there's been years decades of preparation for these six important
[2:52:30.420 --> 2:52:35.700]  things that we need to look for the first is economic destabilization now
[2:52:35.700 --> 2:52:40.780]  remember the Hague alien process you've got to have the opposites you first start
[2:52:40.780 --> 2:52:46.780]  off with a crash a financial meltdown okay economic catastrophe we're in the
[2:52:46.780 --> 2:52:51.100]  midst of that we're about four to six months down the pike on that here's
[2:52:51.100 --> 2:52:57.420]  what has been happening first of all America's economy was broken when oil
[2:52:57.420 --> 2:53:01.740]  you know was shot up by the speculators at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and
[2:53:01.740 --> 2:53:09.420]  such on Wall Street to $147 a barrel okay $4 plus a gallon at the pump they
[2:53:09.420 --> 2:53:12.860]  broke the back of the American economy they drove up the price of real estate
[2:53:12.860 --> 2:53:17.260]  real estate to unparalleled heights gave money out to everybody credit cards
[2:53:17.260 --> 2:53:22.460]  loans etc so that there was this incredible inflation and then suddenly
[2:53:22.460 --> 2:53:27.860]  they whipsawed us and now we have a deleveraging of the economy we had a
[2:53:27.860 --> 2:53:35.940]  really we're now we're having a spiral downward a deflationary process okay now
[2:53:35.940 --> 2:53:41.340]  now this cannot last forever because it will drag the elite down with it now you
[2:53:41.340 --> 2:53:46.340]  and I may like it I like it I like gasoline being a $1.59 I like the fact
[2:53:46.340 --> 2:53:50.700]  they've had to take $10 or $15,000 off the price of a new car I like the fact
[2:53:50.700 --> 2:53:55.620]  that finally after food went up corn oats wheat everything went up you know a
[2:53:55.620 --> 2:53:59.700]  hundred percent suddenly they're back down again now and that's going to be
[2:53:59.700 --> 2:54:04.380]  showing up at our food stores everything is deflating very fast but the experts
[2:54:04.380 --> 2:54:07.820]  are saying it's going to go back up again oh yeah now now we have the whipsaw
[2:54:07.820 --> 2:54:13.100]  they hey galey and the other side okay and so they've done a great amount of
[2:54:13.100 --> 2:54:16.780]  damage they've created millions of foreclosures they've driven people out
[2:54:16.780 --> 2:54:20.820]  of their homes they've taken away people's pensions and retirements they
[2:54:20.820 --> 2:54:25.700]  frightened us entirely and there and now we're willing to do almost anything to
[2:54:25.700 --> 2:54:30.100]  get this economy stable again the next thing they must do and they will do is
[2:54:30.100 --> 2:54:35.820]  to reverse the process and now we're going to begin a period of hyper inflation
[2:54:35.820 --> 2:54:40.260]  now what so the real economy is imploding it's imploding is shrinking
[2:54:40.260 --> 2:54:45.260]  meanwhile there'll be less actual liquidity out there all the liquidity is
[2:54:45.260 --> 2:54:48.580]  for the big central banks so they can buy everything up when it's pennies on
[2:54:48.580 --> 2:54:51.580]  the dollar yeah you mentioned eight point four trillion dollars they
[2:54:51.580 --> 2:54:55.580]  certainly have spent that but they've given it to the nine largest banks Bank
[2:54:55.580 --> 2:54:59.900]  of America sure most of them are and they're telling Congress you have no
[2:54:59.900 --> 2:55:02.900]  authority you're basically under martial law and they had one of the Fed
[2:55:02.900 --> 2:55:07.180]  governors come out in Bloomberg and say that we are now under the war powers
[2:55:07.180 --> 2:55:11.020]  act did you see that well I can understand a Obama has already said his
[2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:15.140]  people have said he's going to begin day one we're talking about January the 20th
[2:55:15.140 --> 2:55:21.100]  or January the 21st and he's going to begin with a huge series of executive
[2:55:21.100 --> 2:55:25.180]  orders and they said it's going to be very popular by it's going to be very
[2:55:25.180 --> 2:55:29.860]  unpopular yeah people will not like this but it's necessary to save America
[2:55:29.860 --> 2:55:34.380]  now remember we have this economic destabilization first there's this
[2:55:34.380 --> 2:55:40.300]  incredible scary process of price deflation suddenly oil drops gold drops
[2:55:40.300 --> 2:55:45.660]  everything and then begins the hyperinflation now how can you how can
[2:55:45.660 --> 2:55:51.900]  you begin this process how can they stop this this deflationary we're going to

[2:57:40.940 --> 2:57:44.180]  you see happening in the economy and then being a you know former military
[2:57:44.180 --> 2:57:48.540]  officer yourself studying of teaching military science the University of
[2:57:48.540 --> 2:57:54.220]  Texas they militarize the police they brainwash the military they train them
[2:57:54.220 --> 2:57:57.060]  that well there's gonna be riots you've got to shoot the American people this is
[2:57:57.060 --> 2:58:01.500]  long-term secret strategic plan to get ready for this that I've covered you've
[2:58:01.500 --> 2:58:06.140]  covered the FEMA camps which they denied now we're public the CFR is
[2:58:06.140 --> 2:58:10.460]  openly on TV admitting they basically run the country this emergence because they
[2:58:10.460 --> 2:58:13.220]  have to get us ready for open world government because we're now to that
[2:58:13.220 --> 2:58:17.660]  point now you're talking about this the the the web saw of deflation inflation
[2:58:17.660 --> 2:58:22.020]  deflation inflation continue well what we have around the world as companies
[2:58:22.020 --> 2:58:26.620]  closing folding the tens of thousands millions of people around the world being
[2:58:26.620 --> 2:58:31.340]  laid off all right and we see every prices of everything going down every
[2:58:31.340 --> 2:58:37.180]  the economies are shrinking contracting we're having incredible storehouses
[2:58:37.180 --> 2:58:42.500]  warehouses full of food okay full of grains they can't find customers for
[2:58:42.500 --> 2:58:47.500]  we're having warehouses over in China listen they're afraid they're afraid in
[2:58:47.500 --> 2:58:51.900]  China they cannot lay off those tens of millions of workers so they keep them
[2:58:51.900 --> 2:58:55.740]  working at those factories building all these products to ship to Western Europe
[2:58:55.740 --> 2:58:59.740]  in the United States why because if they ever laid off all those people there'll
[2:58:59.740 --> 2:59:03.580]  be revolution over there but that means that we're going to see that when they
[2:59:03.580 --> 2:59:09.100]  have all these billions of items of products okay from iPods to whatever to
[2:59:09.100 --> 2:59:16.000]  clothing and etc from China they've got to do something with it now if the whole
[2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:21.900]  world is imploding there's only one way to stop the implosion inflate to inflate
[2:59:21.900 --> 2:59:26.540]  they've got to start reinflating now they began that with the money 8.4
[2:59:26.540 --> 2:59:31.540]  trillion unprecedented okay the 700 billion dollars was just a shock the
[2:59:31.540 --> 2:59:36.020]  American boy that's a little charade you know that's eight plus trillion just in
[2:59:36.020 --> 2:59:39.540]  the first six weeks the last two weeks we haven't gotten any new numbers the
[2:59:39.540 --> 2:59:44.700]  entire gross product of the United States annually is about 13 trillion well
[2:59:44.700 --> 2:59:47.540]  how could have we have gotten to the point where the private bankers tell
[2:59:47.540 --> 2:59:51.380]  Congress and the media we're not going to show you what we're doing I mean this
[2:59:51.380 --> 2:59:56.180]  is open dictatorship by the foreign banks well of course and remember rom
[2:59:56.180 --> 3:00:02.700]  Emanuel of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi thanked him when that 700 billion dollar
[3:00:02.700 --> 3:00:07.420]  bailout bill was approved she said I want to thank congressman Emanuel he
[3:00:07.420 --> 3:00:12.220]  haunched out it he got it passed the core and Obama Obama got the credit for
[3:00:12.220 --> 3:00:15.220]  being the one that finally with a manual that got it done and then these
[3:00:15.220 --> 3:00:19.260]  Obamanoids email me and say no Obama's against the bankers when he got five
[3:00:19.260 --> 3:00:24.020]  times the political contributions from Wall Street that McCain got Pelosi said
[3:00:24.020 --> 3:00:30.180]  on international television at that time she said it was Emanuel and his
[3:00:30.180 --> 3:00:35.260]  knowledge of Wall Street that made this bailout possible so this is a literal
[3:00:35.260 --> 3:00:39.500]  financial coup d'etat by the Bank of England by Wall Street over the entire
[3:00:39.500 --> 3:00:44.180]  economy and now they're saying they may get rid of UST bills and bonds and have
[3:00:44.180 --> 3:00:48.020]  the Federal Reserve issue them and you will buy your bonds government bonds
[3:00:48.020 --> 3:00:53.620]  from them and pay your carbon taxes to them and so they are going to pay for
[3:00:53.620 --> 3:00:56.980]  the issuance they are going to pay yes they said they're going to pay for the
[3:00:56.980 --> 3:01:02.220]  issuance of bonds with oil taxes with Tobin taxes with green taxes this is
[3:01:02.220 --> 3:01:06.140]  unbelievable tax well it is there's gonna be many more taxes to come we're
[3:01:06.140 --> 3:01:09.980]  gonna be a new ones in New York state yeah new that they call that the the tax
[3:01:09.980 --> 3:01:14.500]  hail to New York City but it's coming to all of America and they and they're
[3:01:14.500 --> 3:01:19.140]  going to do it for control over us now back to this economic situation we see
[3:01:19.140 --> 3:01:24.420]  the whipsaw the spiraling downward and the deflation the deleveraging of this
[3:01:24.420 --> 3:01:28.780]  800 trillion dollars that they squandered suddenly there will be the
[3:01:28.780 --> 3:01:31.940]  hyperinflation how does that begin but they will be the only ones with the
[3:01:31.940 --> 3:01:35.140]  money as they rush in to buy everything up oh well yeah well they've got all these
[3:01:35.140 --> 3:01:39.380]  toxic assets for one thing they've got to start building up things again now how
[3:01:39.380 --> 3:01:43.220]  do you do that what do they do during the Great Depression forget about the new
[3:01:43.220 --> 3:01:47.860]  deal and people working at the works project the WPA things billing highways
[3:01:47.860 --> 3:01:53.060]  and forget about that listen let me tell you how FDR okay solve the Great
[3:01:53.060 --> 3:01:58.260]  Depression it's called World War two it's called 50 million dying and
[3:01:58.260 --> 3:02:01.500]  perishing in flames and that's we got a break we got a break we'll come back
[3:02:01.500 --> 3:02:04.500]  with us that's what the Rand Corporation two months ago said shockwaves
[3:02:04.500 --> 3:02:08.020]  around the world saying we don't need a little war like Iraq or Afghanistan or
[3:02:08.020 --> 3:02:12.860]  Serbia we need a big war on the scale of World War two and now they're with
[3:02:12.860 --> 3:02:16.940]  false flag trying to start that between India and Pakistan we'll talk to
[3:02:16.940 --> 3:02:21.660]  the professor of space and aeronautics and military affairs text Mars hello
[3:02:21.660 --> 3:02:25.300]  friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[3:02:25.300 --> 3:02:28.380]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[3:02:28.380 --> 3:02:31.940]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[3:02:31.940 --> 3:02:35.180]  red line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the Super
[3:02:35.180 --> 3:02:39.060]  Dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[3:02:39.060 --> 3:02:42.060]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[3:02:42.060 --> 3:02:45.940]  bailout for the special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they
[3:02:45.940 --> 3:02:49.420]  turned off the telephones and email they voted to print eight hundred to fifty
[3:02:49.420 --> 3:02:53.340]  billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the American and
[3:02:53.340 --> 3:02:57.540]  European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[3:02:57.540 --> 3:03:01.500]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food
[3:03:01.500 --> 3:03:06.220]  beyond many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a
[3:03:06.220 --> 3:03:10.260]  loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[3:03:10.260 --> 3:03:14.460]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[3:03:14.460 --> 3:03:18.300]  in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[3:03:18.300 --> 3:03:21.900]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[3:03:21.900 --> 3:03:26.060]  but jack up prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[3:03:26.060 --> 3:03:29.580]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[3:03:29.580 --> 3:03:32.340]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[3:03:32.340 --> 3:03:36.860]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get
[3:03:36.860 --> 3:03:40.180]  food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand
[3:03:40.180 --> 3:03:43.420]  that by having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a
[3:03:43.420 --> 3:03:47.260]  lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[3:03:47.260 --> 3:03:50.980]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[3:03:50.980 --> 3:03:54.420]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[3:07:45.380 --> 3:07:49.860]  and the Pentagon saying they need it to get us to rally around them while they
[3:07:49.860 --> 3:07:53.580]  bring us into this new world order tell us a little bit about these books when

[3:08:06.620 --> 3:08:11.980]  with his books but briefly tell me about both these books tax well I think Codex
[3:08:11.980 --> 3:08:16.980]  Magica really made an impact now still making an impact because what Codex
[3:08:16.980 --> 3:08:22.500]  Magica does is explain the the the psychopathology of these people they
[3:08:22.500 --> 3:08:28.140]  are psychopaths and and and why are they doing what they do but there's more
[3:08:28.140 --> 3:08:33.340]  than that and you notice the grassroots psychopaths like the zodiac and others
[3:08:33.340 --> 3:08:36.860]  on the hillside strangled they're all into codes and numbers and symbols it
[3:08:36.860 --> 3:08:39.780]  always has an occult meaning and the psychiatrists just say well that's
[3:08:39.780 --> 3:08:42.860]  because they're nuts but why are they always into devil's room of course
[3:08:42.860 --> 3:08:48.620]  there's over a thousand photographs illustrations in Codex Magica over 600
[3:08:48.620 --> 3:08:54.020]  pages and it shows you that the hand signs the the ritualistic hand signs and
[3:08:54.020 --> 3:08:58.740]  symbols used by everything from corporations you're going to see
[3:08:58.740 --> 3:09:05.420]  television programs and commercials you'll see them using hand signs on the
[3:09:05.420 --> 3:09:11.140]  covers of magazines they're actually communicating ritual satanic rituals in
[3:09:11.140 --> 3:09:15.660]  plain sight and we're talking about everybody from president George W.
[3:09:15.660 --> 3:09:20.900]  Bush well their senator Clinton you say what is the meaning of that hand sign
[3:09:20.900 --> 3:09:25.540]  that she's doing on the front cover of Time magazine Pat Robertson it goes on
[3:09:25.540 --> 3:09:29.740]  on Joseph Stalin we go all the way back in history but we bring it up to date
[3:09:29.740 --> 3:09:35.660]  and you will see that they are communicating a sign language a symbolic
[3:09:35.660 --> 3:09:41.060]  all right Robertson yeah Pat Robertson he's giving the Masonic sign there there
[3:09:41.060 --> 3:09:46.660]  many Freemasonry we use the actual Masonic textbooks and we compare these
[3:09:46.660 --> 3:09:51.060]  hand signs handshakes there's Carl Marx doing the same thing that marks that's
[3:09:51.060 --> 3:09:55.220]  right that the Union generals are doing and and Stalin does the same one a
[3:09:55.220 --> 3:10:00.420]  linen gives that same hand sign is I call it the hidden sign of the men of
[3:10:00.420 --> 3:10:04.180]  Jobulon they worship a different God than we do and we talk about the
[3:10:04.180 --> 3:10:10.500]  religion of the Illuminati in the book mysterious monuments is a very important
[3:10:10.500 --> 3:10:16.700]  book it tells the story of how they're using architecture to build this new
[3:10:16.700 --> 3:10:22.540]  world this this grand design the perfect world that they have so we have codex
[3:10:22.540 --> 3:10:26.940]  magic and then we have the companion book mysterious monuments but mysterious
[3:10:26.940 --> 3:10:30.580]  monuments is more than just look at these incredible monuments and their true
[3:10:30.580 --> 3:10:35.740]  meaning their occult meaning but it explains exactly the process of the
[3:10:35.740 --> 3:10:42.580]  Illuminati and this reinvention of the world by first destroying the current
[3:10:42.580 --> 3:10:48.900]  world and then building back from order bringing order out here's here's Anton
[3:10:48.900 --> 3:10:52.460]  LeVay doing the same thing all the presidents and Masonic leaders and
[3:10:52.460 --> 3:10:55.780]  Communist leaders and Pat Robertson are doing yeah that's on the back cover of
[3:10:55.780 --> 3:11:00.740]  his satanic Bible and what is this particular what does the lion's paw mean
[3:11:00.740 --> 3:11:07.900]  well the lion's paw basically means that if I reveal the the oath that I've
[3:11:07.900 --> 3:11:15.740]  taken may my chest be torn open and my my beating heart be made the prey of
[3:11:15.740 --> 3:11:21.500]  vultures so again these are all there's another sign that indicates you know the
[3:11:21.500 --> 3:11:27.340]  neck may my throat be slit from ear to ear if I reveal the secrets of the order
[3:11:27.340 --> 3:11:32.220]  of the Illuminati and of the Masonic lodges so all of these things we have
[3:11:32.220 --> 3:11:37.900]  to understand Barack Obama by the way is a Prince Hall Mason Jesse Jackson is a
[3:11:37.900 --> 3:11:42.500]  33rd degree Mason and no doubt his son is so all of these people are member of
[3:11:42.500 --> 3:11:45.580]  these secret societies by the way the order of skull and bones there's the
[3:11:45.580 --> 3:11:49.580]  James game yeah Jesse James everybody thinks he was just a common robber oh
[3:11:49.580 --> 3:11:55.380]  no there they are given the the Masonic hand signs so so again there's a lot of
[3:11:55.380 --> 3:12:01.260]  secret history forbidden history that is revealed in the book codex magic and
[3:12:01.260 --> 3:12:05.620]  other is the magic codes of the Illuminati all right and the time we've
[3:12:05.620 --> 3:12:08.260]  got left cuz I want to go to calls and time just flies with you text so much
[3:12:08.260 --> 3:12:11.740]  information it's on record they want to start World War three how are they
[3:12:11.740 --> 3:12:16.500]  gonna get that done well there has to be of course just as 9 11 occurred just as
[3:12:16.500 --> 3:12:21.820]  Oklahoma City bombing there's got to be a false flag incident it could be a
[3:12:21.820 --> 3:12:27.820]  suitcase nuclear bomb it and they will blame it of course on the chosen the
[3:12:27.820 --> 3:12:33.860]  designated boogeyman enemy now right now we have the two the twin enemies of
[3:12:33.860 --> 3:12:40.700]  Pakistan and Iran and in fact Pakistan is being built up very fast into the new
[3:12:40.700 --> 3:12:45.980]  boogeyman the new enemy so we have these two Muslim nations we may have for
[3:12:45.980 --> 3:12:52.380]  example a United States naval vessel being sunk or damaged in the Persian
[3:12:52.380 --> 3:12:55.620]  Gulf now what happened well it came out the chain he was planning to stage that
[3:12:55.620 --> 3:12:59.300]  yeah they even came out of the New Yorker magazine and Sy Hirsch that he
[3:12:59.300 --> 3:13:03.220]  wanted to paint up patrol boats to look like Iranian boats and have Navy seals
[3:13:03.220 --> 3:13:09.180]  attack ships absolutely so this would be a false flag incident and they will
[3:13:09.180 --> 3:13:15.140]  blame this on terrorists okay maybe from Iran maybe from Pakistan and of course
[3:13:15.140 --> 3:13:19.700]  we've got to retaliate against these terrorists now now the minute this occurs
[3:13:19.700 --> 3:13:25.660]  the minute that there's war in the Middle East okay what happens well first of
[3:13:25.660 --> 3:13:31.180]  all the price of oil that has fallen from 147 dollars a barrel down to 38 as of
[3:13:31.180 --> 3:13:37.140]  today will suddenly begin to go back up fast we're gonna say 200 300 dollars a
[3:13:37.140 --> 3:13:42.220]  barrel oil but wait that's not all the the Illuminati for a long time many
[3:13:42.220 --> 3:13:47.860]  years decades have controlled the price of oil they wanted gold they wanted to
[3:13:47.860 --> 3:13:52.260]  keep the price of gold down I have never been one for saying buy gold I just said
[3:13:52.260 --> 3:13:56.660]  no because the Illuminati control it but hold on now they're changing course
[3:13:56.660 --> 3:14:01.420]  remember they're moving they're going to be moving from this deleveraging this
[3:14:01.420 --> 3:14:07.020]  deflationary spiral they want to hyper inflate things what better way to do it
[3:14:07.020 --> 3:14:15.340]  than oil gold and food agricultural commodities you're going to see an
[3:14:15.340 --> 3:14:23.500]  incredible explosion upward in the price of oil gold and food these are the three
[3:14:23.500 --> 3:14:27.980]  levers that they will use real estate takes too long the stock market well
[3:14:27.980 --> 3:14:33.620]  again we're that that takes too long but these three things can be sent upward
[3:14:33.620 --> 3:14:40.820]  overnight so I see once the the whistle goes war begins panic people will panic
[3:14:40.820 --> 3:14:44.020]  toward gold they see it as a safe paper that's already being reported that's
[3:14:44.020 --> 3:14:50.540]  happening oh yeah so I believe it's very possible again I'm a guy that I've had
[3:14:50.540 --> 3:14:56.420]  power of prophecy ministries for 23 years I have never said buy gold but
[3:14:56.420 --> 3:15:02.500]  today on your program this is the first time I'm telling people now might be the
[3:15:02.500 --> 3:15:10.500]  time why the Illuminati did not want okay inflation before from the days of Paul
[3:15:10.500 --> 3:15:14.540]  Volcker he gave us 22% interest rates to keep down inflation and now he's in
[3:15:14.540 --> 3:15:18.940]  charge of economic recovery former head of the Fed Paul Volcker he's the guy that
[3:15:18.940 --> 3:15:25.700]  gave America 22% interest rates but wait now they want that again now they want
[3:15:25.700 --> 3:15:29.740]  to bring up everything again hyperinflation but it all begins from
[3:15:29.740 --> 3:15:34.460]  war war will instantly bring the hyperinflation look at look at Pakistan
[3:15:34.460 --> 3:15:37.980]  India that was clearly staged and that's even come out in Indian papers that that
[3:15:37.980 --> 3:15:44.020]  was staged by Indian intelligence the day of the Mumbai killings there in India
[3:15:44.020 --> 3:15:48.300]  supposedly by Pakistani terrorists the day that occurred oil began to go our
[3:15:48.300 --> 3:15:55.340]  goal that that had fallen to 756 went up over 800 again you see this is the kind
[3:15:55.340 --> 3:16:01.020]  of thing that will swing go and drive the price up to unparalleled heights once
[3:16:01.020 --> 3:16:06.900]  the war kicks off then the Illuminati's process reverses the whipsaw of
[3:16:06.900 --> 3:16:12.620]  economic destabilization begin there are millions who are being destroyed by the
[3:16:12.620 --> 3:16:17.140]  the spiral downward through deflation okay checks we have millions more will
[3:16:17.140 --> 3:16:22.540]  be destroyed through the hyperinflation all right now I've got a few other
[3:16:22.540 --> 3:16:24.900]  questions I want to get into before you leave us we're just running out of time
[3:16:24.900 --> 3:16:31.620]  here but we're gonna come back and take phone calls on September 11th 2001 along

[3:22:21.100 --> 3:22:25.420]  been listening but my question is it got kind of got off the message I was going
[3:22:25.420 --> 3:22:31.380]  to call up about this war powers act there was a freedom site website that
[3:22:31.380 --> 3:22:39.780]  states that worry we're under war powers since 1933 well yes yes Roosevelt put
[3:22:39.780 --> 3:22:43.740]  us under war powers in 33 but now they fully engage it it's kind of like you
[3:22:43.740 --> 3:22:47.820]  have a car that has fifth gear but you're not always using fifth gear we've
[3:22:47.820 --> 3:22:50.900]  been put into fifth gear and Congress was told eight weeks ago you give us
[3:22:50.900 --> 3:22:54.380]  unlimited power the bill said can't be reviewed can't be looked at above the law
[3:22:54.380 --> 3:22:58.380]  they said you do this or we'll declare physical martial law and that was in the
[3:22:58.380 --> 3:23:02.500]  Arizona Phoenix Business Journal I mean that was in this article from yesterday
[3:23:02.500 --> 3:23:07.340]  admitting we are under war powers act Bloomberg reported that war powers act
[3:23:07.340 --> 3:23:10.180]  that even the other Fed governors aren't involved now it's all secret
[3:23:10.180 --> 3:23:14.980]  trillions disappearing I mean this is open Ponzi scheme scammers looting and
[3:23:14.980 --> 3:23:19.860]  raping us and threatening us with the military and police text I wanted to ask
[3:23:19.860 --> 3:23:22.980]  you that then we'll go back to Betty how do you see this unfolding though when
[3:23:22.980 --> 3:23:25.620]  they try to turn the police and military loose on the people I don't see that
[3:23:25.620 --> 3:23:31.220]  going too well well remember they first have to have this incredible 9 11 type
[3:23:31.220 --> 3:23:35.540]  incident in fact it's got to be a multiple of a hundred times as bad as 9
[3:23:35.540 --> 3:23:41.060]  11 so frightened people and then you set up people as the boogeymen okay
[3:23:41.060 --> 3:23:45.940]  patriots who own guns patriots who demand their constitutional rights they're
[3:23:45.940 --> 3:23:50.420]  gonna stage lots of little militia false flags and white supremacists absolutely
[3:23:50.420 --> 3:23:55.780]  and so we have the creation already of the national security state and we will
[3:23:55.780 --> 3:24:01.340]  see this fulfillment of the big brother process brought to its culmination but
[3:24:01.340 --> 3:24:06.140]  remember they must have enemies and I believe the everyday citizen out there
[3:24:06.140 --> 3:24:10.700]  the the people who still believe in the Constitution and individual rights and
[3:24:10.700 --> 3:24:14.660]  it doesn't matter if you're left or right wing believe me you are the enemy if
[3:24:14.660 --> 3:24:19.540]  you believe in personal freedom and individualism and we're going to be the
[3:24:19.540 --> 3:24:23.260]  enemy and they're gonna use the media to point the finger at us exactly and we
[3:24:23.260 --> 3:24:25.500]  already see it happening they're kind of going back to the old Clinton thing of
[3:24:25.500 --> 3:24:30.300]  militias gun owners Obama saying we're clinging to our Bibles and our guns go
[3:24:30.300 --> 3:24:35.340]  ahead and finish up what you were saying Betty yes and also the long line of the
[3:24:35.340 --> 3:24:39.980]  war is like the development of these chemical manufacturing plants all
[3:24:39.980 --> 3:24:45.140]  dotted across the United States and they're the nuclear bombs I'm I'm really
[3:24:45.140 --> 3:24:51.380]  scared for a world war three the capacity well they're looking to start a
[3:24:51.380 --> 3:24:55.700]  global crisis in Central Asia in the Middle East I don't know about you know
[3:24:55.700 --> 3:24:59.940]  things happening here but very serious Betty thank you for the call let's talk

[3:25:17.860 --> 3:25:21.500]  bring to the table some ideas of what I think might happen that I haven't heard
[3:25:21.500 --> 3:25:29.620]  anybody else talking about in World War two Hitler used he used a counterfeit
[3:25:29.620 --> 3:25:34.260]  as a means of weapon he was gonna fly over Europe and drop off a bunch of
[3:25:34.260 --> 3:25:38.660]  British notes is do you think that there might be a possibility that along with
[3:25:38.660 --> 3:25:44.540]  the inflation deflation scam that they might also kick up some kind of a huge
[3:25:44.540 --> 3:25:48.660]  counterfeit scam that might the Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve is
[3:25:48.660 --> 3:25:52.060]  counterfeit again when the money's first printed it takes only your take

[3:25:55.300 --> 3:25:57.860]  first print the money it has value they're not even printing it they're
[3:25:57.860 --> 3:26:02.180]  issuing zeros and ones and computers they buy up real assets then once it
[3:26:02.180 --> 3:26:08.580]  deflates in hyperinflation they give us all the debt and then they erect
[3:26:08.580 --> 3:26:13.580]  hundreds of new taxes through IMF World Bank shock therapy to squeeze us out of
[3:26:13.580 --> 3:26:16.940]  it what they do to third world countries they're now doing now stay there

[3:29:56.220 --> 3:30:01.620]  of the world government we could debate all day who exactly they are who has the
[3:30:01.620 --> 3:30:05.140]  most power regardless they've openly declared their world government against
[3:30:05.140 --> 3:30:08.340]  us they're openly coming after our liberties and freedoms we're gonna go
[3:30:08.340 --> 3:30:11.820]  back to Eric David Ben Pat Francis and others in a moment the text I wanted to
[3:30:11.820 --> 3:30:17.900]  ask you this question again why are they coming out and saying with this is
[3:30:17.900 --> 3:30:21.700]  world government it is tyrannical but tyranny is good sure you saw the
[3:30:21.700 --> 3:30:24.780]  financial times of London last week and the Wall Street Journal saying New
[3:30:24.780 --> 3:30:27.860]  World Order yeah you'll pay your taxes to the bank I keep going over this
[3:30:27.860 --> 3:30:30.540]  because we've been called kooks and nuts and crazies because we would read the
[3:30:30.540 --> 3:30:33.660]  documents and the government documents and their own reports and the white
[3:30:33.660 --> 3:30:37.180]  papers now it's all emerged which we knew they'd always have to do when they
[3:30:37.180 --> 3:30:41.500]  finally try to put the capstone on does this signal that we are really here at
[3:30:41.500 --> 3:30:45.300]  the big plunge we are really here at the culmination of all the plans you know
[3:30:45.300 --> 3:30:51.100]  the zero hour the d-day for the New World Order conflagration I mean does this
[3:30:51.100 --> 3:30:55.980]  signify the fact that they're uncloking themselves doesn't this signify that
[3:30:55.980 --> 3:31:01.300]  we're here we're seeing a crescendo now I mean everything is coming to
[3:31:01.300 --> 3:31:07.460]  culmination but remember that process when when Lenin and Trotsky were sent in
[3:31:07.460 --> 3:31:13.340]  you know to to Moscow and began the the great Soviet rebel revolution and
[3:31:13.340 --> 3:31:17.740]  remember more people died from communism and we're talking about over a hundred
[3:31:17.740 --> 3:31:23.060]  million people who died in gulags purges and so forth so so it takes a while
[3:31:23.060 --> 3:31:27.620]  though at first Lenin said we're going to bring freedom to people we're going
[3:31:27.620 --> 3:31:33.260]  to to throw out the the evil count change change a workers paradise we're
[3:31:33.260 --> 3:31:37.420]  going to reinvent things and help the workers and we are listen to this we are
[3:31:37.420 --> 3:31:41.260]  the we're a dictatorship but wait we're the dictatorship of the people of the
[3:31:41.260 --> 3:31:47.020]  proletariat we represent the people okay this will be the and the average rich
[3:31:47.020 --> 3:31:49.820]  people the rich people were running and they went destroyed the middle class and
[3:31:49.820 --> 3:31:54.060]  even poor farmers anybody that was somewhat self-sufficient and of course I
[3:31:54.060 --> 3:31:58.860]  mean you know these are public down the KGB files been released that you know as
[3:31:58.860 --> 3:32:03.580]  you've reported they would have the NKVD out in the country shot and they say
[3:32:03.580 --> 3:32:07.820]  okay we've killed half the town you know do we come back no no continue killing
[3:32:07.820 --> 3:32:13.420]  oh they wanted more and more blood in fact the linen demanded more blood more
[3:32:13.420 --> 3:32:17.580]  blood so we were gonna have this in America to work we're moving into a
[3:32:17.580 --> 3:32:23.060]  Leninist new world order now how are they going to do this first of all they
[3:32:23.060 --> 3:32:26.180]  couldn't use George W. Bush and Dick Cheney those guys are morons
[3:32:26.180 --> 3:32:31.820]  everybody laughs at them they're hated but now they've got a man that the whole
[3:32:31.820 --> 3:32:37.740]  world loves the whole world admires and he has the oratory skills they're going
[3:32:37.740 --> 3:32:45.260]  to use him he is biracial he represents the whole world across borders so they
[3:32:45.260 --> 3:32:50.660]  have the vehicle now and he they have a ruthless chief of staff behind him in
[3:32:50.660 --> 3:32:55.580]  wrong the cruel Emmanuel now this is a guy who in the Washington Post they had
[3:32:55.580 --> 3:33:00.900]  met that when Bill Clinton had had had just one re-election he for like ten
[3:33:00.900 --> 3:33:04.540]  minutes he listed people that hadn't gone against him and with a steak knife
[3:33:04.540 --> 3:33:10.660]  foaming at the mouse screaming die die just enough just just just every time
[3:33:10.660 --> 3:33:14.780]  you're a dead man for going against Clinton now I want people to understand
[3:33:14.780 --> 3:33:19.660]  something wrong the cruel Emmanuel was in the Clinton White House you're right
[3:33:19.660 --> 3:33:24.100]  and he haunch of the gun confiscation and his new Attorney General haunch
[3:33:24.100 --> 3:33:28.220]  showed the cover-up of okc he was the guy that brought Monica Lewinsky in so
[3:33:28.220 --> 3:33:32.140]  that they could blackmail Bill Clinton he brought Monica Lewinsky and that's why
[3:33:32.140 --> 3:33:35.500]  they love Obama because he's got all this dirt on him I mean look at him with
[3:33:35.500 --> 3:33:41.860]  Resko and Blagojevich and all of these guys and it's admitted now that he was
[3:33:41.860 --> 3:33:47.580]  a numbers racket runner working for the mob Blagojevich they had weekly
[3:33:47.580 --> 3:33:52.460]  meetings of Blagojevich with Obama and Rom Emmanuel and they groomed and trained
[3:33:52.460 --> 3:33:58.980]  him during his campaign for the governorship of Illinois so Blagojevich
[3:33:58.980 --> 3:34:03.940]  is part of that system now what we have to understand then is we have these two
[3:34:03.940 --> 3:34:11.100]  saviors Obama and Rom the Cruel Emmanuel and and the people of America are
[3:34:11.100 --> 3:34:15.580]  being now set up by Time Magazine Newsweek US News and War Report all of
[3:34:15.580 --> 3:34:21.260]  the the channels we're being set up to accept this new Messiah and a crisis
[3:34:21.260 --> 3:34:25.340]  came from Bush and all the horrible stuff to come just do what Obama says
[3:34:25.340 --> 3:34:29.060]  he'll save us the saviors are here and that's why they're saying he's like a
[3:34:29.060 --> 3:34:33.980]  Lincoln he's like Lincoln and Roosevelt rolled into one he will unify
[3:34:33.980 --> 3:34:37.340]  during the crisis he will be the strongman but but instead of make work
[3:34:37.340 --> 3:34:41.740]  brigades you know like we had that were bad enough socializing things under
[3:34:41.740 --> 3:34:45.660]  Roosevelt Franklin Delano nothing happens by accident in Washington it's all
[3:34:45.660 --> 3:34:52.180]  planned they're saying million man youth brigade million person domestic spy
[3:34:52.180 --> 3:34:55.860]  force as strong as the military and people said oh he didn't mean that and
[3:34:55.860 --> 3:35:00.540]  now on his change.gov they pulled it now saying yes you will have to serve
[3:35:00.540 --> 3:35:05.780]  including people up to 65 years of age all Americans will serve and then all
[3:35:05.780 --> 3:35:08.780]  collectivist and then all collectivist and then Rom Emmanuel was being
[3:35:08.780 --> 3:35:11.580]  questioned by the Newark Daily News about it and he said what you don't want to
[3:35:11.580 --> 3:35:14.580]  be put on the train started laughing well what does that mean what you don't
[3:35:14.580 --> 3:35:18.300]  want to be put on the trains and in the Soviet Union they had come some all the
[3:35:18.300 --> 3:35:21.940]  the so he's laughing they I mean they plan to do this of their ability they
[3:35:21.940 --> 3:35:26.700]  plan to do a red style Nazi style purge here they had come some all the
[3:35:26.700 --> 3:35:31.140]  the commonest youth in the Soviet Union but they have the Nazi youth of course
[3:35:31.140 --> 3:35:34.740]  as well so and no doubt and they're gonna by the way these youth are going to be
[3:35:34.740 --> 3:35:40.460]  rooting out and tattling on their parents and climate cops in the U.S.
[3:35:40.460 --> 3:35:45.180]  in England in the textbooks in the ads it they were red and black uniforms and
[3:35:45.180 --> 3:35:49.620]  arm bands and it says turn your parents in in the New York Times said these are
[3:35:49.620 --> 3:35:54.060]  about a month ago these are good parents and good children is in the parents
[3:35:54.060 --> 3:35:58.740]  were saying I'm so proud my child is reporting me and writing dossiers for
[3:35:58.740 --> 3:36:03.140]  the school no I'm not kidding you saw it probably yeah it was in 1984 I'm not
[3:36:03.140 --> 3:36:06.820]  kidding in the New York and listen now kids they're talking about arresting
[3:36:06.820 --> 3:36:09.940]  kids if they have a cough drop at school that was in the news and the news
[3:36:09.940 --> 3:36:14.620]  says maybe they need to be arrested maybe a cough drop see so so if you're some
[3:36:14.620 --> 3:36:17.940]  banker criminal you can still trillions but if a child has a over-the-counter
[3:36:17.940 --> 3:36:22.980]  cough drop in the candy section for their sore throat the SWAT team's coming
[3:36:22.980 --> 3:36:27.700]  oh yeah well it is a national security state they will they will they've already
[3:36:27.700 --> 3:36:31.660]  got the gulags they've already spent you know billions of dollars to build these
[3:36:31.660 --> 3:36:35.780]  gulags and now they're going to activate these things but now remember this
[3:36:35.780 --> 3:36:40.140]  they've got to have boogeymen they've got to have the Osama bin Laden's the
[3:36:40.140 --> 3:36:45.100]  Ockman and Agents and they've got to have the domestic terrorist so I believe
[3:36:45.100 --> 3:36:49.460]  there will be false incidents created and they will blame it on the domestic
[3:36:49.460 --> 3:36:55.060]  terrorist so you and I could be enemies remember George Bush when he right after
[3:36:55.060 --> 3:37:00.260]  9-11 he went to the United Nations and he said we cannot tolerate these
[3:37:00.260 --> 3:37:06.940]  conspiracy theorist okay concerning the attacks of 9-11 right then he talked
[3:37:06.940 --> 3:37:10.700]  about a dark cult of evil that feeds off human suffering at this weird little
[3:37:10.700 --> 3:37:15.700]  look on his face yeah well what an evil man that guy is but but now we have
[3:37:15.700 --> 3:37:21.820]  Obama much beloved with all these yeah like the portrait of Dorian Gray and
[3:37:21.820 --> 3:37:25.700]  then Obama looks like a nice guy and again the psychological engineers knew
[3:37:25.700 --> 3:37:29.300]  what they were doing they give us the evil corrupt idiot prince now they give
[3:37:29.300 --> 3:37:32.860]  us the golden boy the golden boy well Abner Mikva who was White House
[3:37:32.860 --> 3:37:37.460]  counsel under Bill Clinton he's a guy that covered up everything you know
[3:37:37.460 --> 3:37:41.140]  during the impeachment proceedings he was the White House counsel okay very
[3:37:41.140 --> 3:37:45.900]  wealthy multimillionaire Jewish former US congressman in the Chicago Tribune
[3:37:45.900 --> 3:37:52.300]  there's an article entitled Barack Obama the first Jewish president the first
[3:37:52.300 --> 3:37:57.300]  Jewish president remember remember that they called Bill Clinton the first
[3:37:57.300 --> 3:38:01.540]  black president and he relished being called it he said I've been called the
[3:38:01.540 --> 3:38:05.940]  first black president so so we're talking about people didn't like the
[3:38:05.940 --> 3:38:10.860]  undue influence of Israeli nationals and intelligence in the Bush White House
[3:38:10.860 --> 3:38:14.660]  it's now going to get worse but but what is the system going to do is top
[3:38:14.660 --> 3:38:18.180]  professors and many Jewish leaders as well come out and say that what Israel's
[3:38:18.180 --> 3:38:22.180]  doing in the US trying to control our foreign policy and domestic operations
[3:38:22.180 --> 3:38:27.340]  is out of control well the media is going to be very firmly control remember
[3:38:27.340 --> 3:38:29.700]  wrong that's why they're announcing they're going after the web
[3:38:29.700 --> 3:38:33.420]  absolutely the internet's the big they're already censoring internet
[3:38:33.420 --> 3:38:37.340]  shortly suddenly it's ready on that or the big problems right now because
[3:38:37.340 --> 3:38:41.660]  there's still all these websites like yours like info wars dot com or power
[3:38:41.660 --> 3:38:46.140]  prophecy dot com mine they're telling the truth we're going to be the enemy next
[3:38:46.140 --> 3:38:50.100]  and we're already being attacked no no suddenly Google everywhere we're being
[3:38:50.100 --> 3:38:53.580]  shut down you can't do bulletins you can't share videos they're banning sites
[3:38:53.580 --> 3:38:58.300]  for no reason and they're announcing of all places that the ADL literally is
[3:38:58.300 --> 3:39:01.900]  running YouTube now and it says whatever the ADL says you to know it's on the
[3:39:01.900 --> 3:39:05.660]  website yeah they have their own agents I believe I'm I believe I mean I mean
[3:39:05.660 --> 3:39:10.740]  YouTube says on its rules page we're using them that the ADL sits there and
[3:39:10.740 --> 3:39:14.900]  decides well so I mean I mean my god they're going to censor us there are
[3:39:14.900 --> 3:39:19.140]  things that come out be said what we've said on this program today people better
[3:39:19.140 --> 3:39:23.260]  audio tape or they better get a CD of your program because these things are
[3:39:23.260 --> 3:39:27.900]  not going to be allowed to be said and I think it's going to be just the good
[3:39:27.900 --> 3:39:32.260]  news is if everybody stands up and speaks against this fascist system the
[3:39:32.260 --> 3:39:36.260]  new world order I mean I mean I mean they can't silence everybody the you know
[3:39:36.260 --> 3:39:40.020]  the answer is we need to be bold we need to really say it like it is we need to
[3:39:40.020 --> 3:39:43.460]  go further when we're gone let's let's go back to the calls finishing up with
[3:39:43.460 --> 3:39:48.700]  Eric in Wisconsin finish up with your pointer well you know I agree with text
[3:39:48.700 --> 3:39:53.580]  that they're using certain tools as a weapons of money and gas and and food
[3:39:53.580 --> 3:39:58.460]  you know I think that what we need to do is to realize that we do have things
[3:39:58.460 --> 3:40:02.060]  that they don't have to and we have numbers and we do have our own money
[3:40:02.060 --> 3:40:05.060]  even though we're not stockpiling it the way they do but every time we buy
[3:40:05.060 --> 3:40:07.860]  something we make we choose whether we're going to shop at Walmart I take
[3:40:07.860 --> 3:40:12.300]  GMO food that's why GMO food is going out of a lot of the stores because people
[3:40:12.300 --> 3:40:17.340]  won't buy it right and and they even passed a law saying that organic food
[3:40:17.340 --> 3:40:20.780]  can now be stamped organic even if it's not a hundred percent organic so they're
[3:40:20.780 --> 3:40:23.460]  trying to end run I agree so so you're right we can vote with our dollars go
[3:40:23.460 --> 3:40:30.700]  ahead anything else I yeah you know the chain is only as strong as weakest link
[3:40:30.700 --> 3:40:33.300]  and I think that we need to strengthen our local economies I think we need to
[3:40:33.300 --> 3:40:35.940]  wake people up and you've been doing an awesome job and I really applaud that
[3:40:35.940 --> 3:40:41.220]  Alex thanks I appreciate you calling and saying that let's go ahead and talk to
[3:40:41.220 --> 3:40:49.140]  David in Michigan David you're on the air welcome hi yes how you doing this
[3:40:49.140 --> 3:40:54.580]  is Gordy's brother oh I'm that Gordy a few times nice guy how you doing pretty
[3:40:54.580 --> 3:41:00.860]  good how you doing good good he just kind of turned me on to your show by
[3:41:00.860 --> 3:41:07.980]  telephone I've been listening to you guys for a couple of weeks now that's
[3:41:07.980 --> 3:41:11.980]  right we have a if people can't listen on shortwave internet don't have a name
[3:41:11.980 --> 3:41:16.460]  an FM satellite in their area we have a number we put it on screen I'll read it
[3:41:16.460 --> 3:41:22.140]  out or we have a number where about 200 people can call and listen for free to
[3:41:22.140 --> 3:41:25.620]  the show over the phone and we and we have that in preparation for when they
[3:41:25.620 --> 3:41:29.900]  do shut down the web and things so we can feed micro FM's feed radio stations
[3:41:29.900 --> 3:41:32.820]  you know it's kind of an emergency backup we're gonna try to add more phones
[3:41:32.820 --> 3:41:35.980]  because it's not internet these are these are regular phone lines so that's why
[3:41:35.980 --> 3:41:39.100]  it costs us a few thousand dollars a month that's why sponsoring us is
[3:41:39.100 --> 3:41:42.420]  important but other than the way you're listening sir do you have any points you
[3:41:42.420 --> 3:41:49.100]  like to make yeah while listening to you guys I heard text talking about Albert
[3:41:49.100 --> 3:41:55.980]  Pike it's kind of funny because about six years ago I heard Jack Van Impey
[3:41:55.980 --> 3:42:04.900]  say that Albert Pike and Giuseppe Messina planned the three world wars back
[3:42:04.900 --> 3:42:10.460]  in the 1800s yeah the British Naval Museum has his letters to the masons
[3:42:10.460 --> 3:42:14.420]  over there and he wrote some about it in his book and and and he explained the
[3:42:14.420 --> 3:42:18.820]  three wars text why don't you briefly mention that the three wars you know how
[3:42:18.820 --> 3:42:21.460]  they would engineer these these three wars against humanity to bring in the
[3:42:21.460 --> 3:42:26.700]  Luciferian religion the final war would be a precipitated by a great crisis in
[3:42:26.700 --> 3:42:31.580]  the Middle East I remember this this plan for these three war 1878 yeah we've
[3:42:31.580 --> 3:42:35.020]  had World War one we've had World War two and now we have this incredible
[3:42:35.020 --> 3:42:39.460]  Middle East juggernaut that's facing and he wrote this in 1878 yeah and he said
[3:42:39.460 --> 3:42:44.420]  that the third one would be the final climactic one when all the religions
[3:42:44.420 --> 3:42:49.740]  would be destroyed and basically the Empire of Freemasonry and the
[3:42:49.740 --> 3:42:52.980]  Illuminati would be established and he also said I feel the power of Lucifer
[3:42:52.980 --> 3:42:59.340]  seething in my hands and when Rob the Grand Masonic Hall in DC you know gave
[3:42:59.340 --> 3:43:06.220]  him a tour and it was it was Lincoln huge statues it was huge statues of Albert
[3:43:06.220 --> 3:43:09.780]  Pike and I talked to local masons who are porch masons and they go oh no Albert
[3:43:09.780 --> 3:43:12.780]  Pike we're not involved with him yeah he was just a supreme commander of the
[3:43:12.780 --> 3:43:19.140]  whole world oh yeah well Fred Kleineck 33rd degree sovereign Grand Commander up
[3:43:19.140 --> 3:43:24.940]  until just a few years ago said that Pike's book morals and dogma is the
[3:43:24.940 --> 3:43:30.220]  crooks of all of Freemasonry he said we should use it as a daily guide for
[3:43:30.220 --> 3:43:35.020]  living so I think they're sovereign Grand Commander knows a lot more than
[3:43:35.020 --> 3:43:38.460]  just the some of the local masons who are just some of these guys are nice
[3:43:38.460 --> 3:43:43.100]  guys they've joined the gestures of the Shriners for whatever reasons business
[3:43:43.100 --> 3:43:47.540]  reasons of friendships and so actually I had no idea John can you dig that clip
[3:43:47.540 --> 3:43:50.780]  up where the masons going into the Shriners meaning and we have the video
[3:43:50.780 --> 3:43:55.180]  this and he says oh sweet Lucifer oh sweet oh yeah I've seen that hey John can
[3:43:55.180 --> 3:43:58.500]  you do that from a few months ago hey listen thanks thanks for the call David
[3:43:58.500 --> 3:44:02.340]  good to hear from you say hi to Gordy Ben in Tennessee you're on the air welcome
[3:44:02.340 --> 3:44:07.660]  Ben hey guys Alex I just want to thank you for everything that you do you've
[3:44:07.660 --> 3:44:13.220]  really inspired me to do everything that I can to just spread the info and get it
[3:44:13.220 --> 3:44:18.260]  out there my I we started an organization called Christian action
[3:44:18.260 --> 3:44:23.420]  against apathy because we believe that if the trip like I believe God's given you
[3:44:23.420 --> 3:44:27.900]  the knowledge that you have because he wants to prepare the church because when
[3:44:27.900 --> 3:44:32.220]  all this stuff collapses man if we are prepared then we are in a place that we
[3:44:32.220 --> 3:44:37.060]  can really truly minister to people and really give them God's love which is
[3:44:37.060 --> 3:44:41.100]  really the only hope that we have I agree well it was the churches that led the
[3:44:41.100 --> 3:44:45.540]  fight against King George the third and and that's why the establishment the
[3:44:45.540 --> 3:44:49.140]  war the the International Council of Churches and others as the Texas written
[3:44:49.140 --> 3:44:53.020]  about decades ago came in and took the churches over and text now we have 26
[3:44:53.020 --> 3:44:57.100]  thousand preachers secretly recruited by FEMA to teach their flocks to turn
[3:44:57.100 --> 3:45:00.980]  their guns in and go along with the New World Order and now it's admitted
[3:45:00.980 --> 3:45:05.340]  everything we told people about when it was secret is admitted now so thank God
[3:45:05.340 --> 3:45:11.020]  bless you for reaching out to the churches it's been going really well

[3:50:55.380 --> 3:51:03.900]  air go ahead yes welcome I just like to say to text Mars that the proverb of 24
[3:51:03.900 --> 3:51:11.620]  20 21 and 22 I believe is for Obama and his crew it says my son fear thou the
[3:51:11.620 --> 3:51:17.380]  Lord and the King and metal not with them that are given to change for their
[3:51:17.380 --> 3:51:23.580]  calamity shall rise suddenly and who knoweth the ruins of them both so I
[3:51:23.580 --> 3:51:31.580]  believe you know he wants change but we want to return to what we had but I think
[3:51:31.580 --> 3:51:36.300]  you know that scripture applies to them real easy since they're the ones that
[3:51:36.300 --> 3:51:41.020]  want change oh it's changed but it's like the change of Lenin and Hitler all
[3:51:41.020 --> 3:51:44.340]  created by the New World Order crew I mean they are just they're just
[3:51:44.340 --> 3:51:50.100]  absolutely wicked anything else Pat yeah I heard you talk about the pastors I
[3:51:50.100 --> 3:51:55.420]  have a niece and her husband and their pastors and they joined FEMA and Billy
[3:51:55.420 --> 3:52:01.380]  Graham's crew that organization two years ago so I just want to let them know
[3:52:01.380 --> 3:52:06.500]  that is true there's thousands of pastors getting ready to lead their
[3:52:06.500 --> 3:52:12.100]  people into gulag camps and talk them in to giving up their guns and taking their
[3:52:12.100 --> 3:52:17.860]  shots and whatever else that's called being a Judas goat yeah well I sent a
[3:52:17.860 --> 3:52:21.940]  big package of everything I could find to them about Billy Graham and and
[3:52:21.940 --> 3:52:27.340]  Hitler and what happened to the Catholic priest how they were he was the
[3:52:27.340 --> 3:52:30.940]  defender of the faith and how they took off their robes and put on uniforms I
[3:52:30.940 --> 3:52:35.300]  sent everything that I could find so I hope that they read it and I hope they
[3:52:35.300 --> 3:52:41.140]  pay attention absolutely you know I apologize to Francis and Roger and
[3:52:41.140 --> 3:52:44.820]  everybody else because I want to be able to give text Mars a chance to have

[3:53:22.260 --> 3:53:25.900]  amazing courage he's had text you got about two minutes to close it out sir
[3:53:25.900 --> 3:53:29.540]  with any other key points you want to add about the times we're going into
[3:53:29.540 --> 3:53:35.980]  well we're going into some very chaotic times it's an engineered chaos but but
[3:53:35.980 --> 3:53:42.300]  always keep this in mind okay there is a God there is absolutely a God and
[3:53:42.300 --> 3:53:46.660]  it's interesting Jesus one of Jesus greatest sayings was very simple fear
[3:53:46.660 --> 3:53:54.700]  not fear not so I believe the wonderful thing about America is that we have a
[3:53:54.700 --> 3:53:59.340]  lot of brave courageous people out there and you know I like we don't you and I
[3:53:59.340 --> 3:54:03.260]  don't have all the answers but I know this much we've got some people out
[3:54:03.260 --> 3:54:08.940]  there that care that won't change but what they want is the change that will
[3:54:08.940 --> 3:54:16.260]  bring us back to the the Constitution and this individual personal freedom now
[3:54:16.260 --> 3:54:20.260]  I think we can achieve that but we're gonna have to fight very very hard and
[3:54:20.260 --> 3:54:25.020]  by the way I think they're innovative ways we need to study you know back in
[3:54:25.020 --> 3:54:28.820]  history what happened with the Sovietization process and how people
[3:54:28.820 --> 3:54:32.860]  defeated it oh and how people have defeated that and and I think we can do
[3:54:32.860 --> 3:54:37.380]  the same thing here in America there there's a lot of us listen I believe we
[3:54:37.380 --> 3:54:42.020]  are the dominant force in American society and that's why they want to
[3:54:42.020 --> 3:54:46.540]  destroy us absolutely text Mars great having you thank you Alex God bless you
