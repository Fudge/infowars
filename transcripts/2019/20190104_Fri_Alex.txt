[00:00:05.757 --> 00:00:06.318]  We've got it.
[00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:12.803]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:17.006]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:22.891]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:24.612 --> 00:00:30.137]  President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tried tirelessly to get a border wall funded.
[00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:40.066]  With fingers in their ears, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer wouldn't hear any of it, deceptively claiming it was President Trump and the Republicans that brought the government to a stalemate.
[00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:43.469]  And even though the facts have been presented repeatedly,
[00:00:43.849 --> 00:00:47.211]  You hear a lot of talk that there are experts that say that walls don't work.
[00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.994]  I promise you that if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work.
[00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:54.795]  I worked in Naco, Arizona for 10 years.
[00:00:55.296 --> 00:01:01.819]  We didn't have physical barriers in Naco, and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.663]  We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially.
[00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:11.224]  The President has the support of the American people because they want to feel safe.
[00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:17.667]  The number one duty that the President has, and frankly that Congress shares with him, is to protect the people in this country.
[00:01:17.707 --> 00:01:19.748]  We have a national crisis at our border.
[00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:23.990]  We also have a humanitarian crisis at our border, and the President's not going to back off.
[00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:31.535]  Out of the 100 freshmen reporting for duty to the House and the 115th Congress, 64 of them were Democrats.
[00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:35.758]  But this is no longer a Democratic Party anyone recognizes.
[00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:43.403]  This new party touted the New Green Agenda, a multi-trillion dollar money pit focusing on a sure path to socialism
[00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:44.744]  People love you, and you win.
[00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:47.606]  And when your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won, bullies don't win.
[00:01:48.106 --> 00:01:49.047]  And I said, baby, they don't.
[00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.828]  Because we're going to go in there, we're going to impeach them all.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.923]  While Governor Cuomo echoed the rise of democratic socialism in his acceptance speech.
[00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:32.272]  Just as FDR turned the frustration of the economic depression into a movement to pass the New Deal, let New York use the frustration of the social depression to pass a new justice agenda advancing social, racial, and economic justice.
[00:02:32.632 --> 00:02:35.614]  And let us address our issues.
[00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:42.655]  Our very real issues with a progressive agenda, not a regressive agenda.
[00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:49.757]  An agenda that moves us up, forward, and united, not down, backwards, and divided.
[00:02:50.537 --> 00:03:05.300]  Blue Dog Democrat Tennessee Congressman Jim Cooper summed up the desperation among the eroding Democratic Party, tweeting, Today I voted present in the vote for Speaker of the House, consistent with my eight-year push for new Democratic leadership.
[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.824]  Now that we are back in the majority, I did not vote for a rival candidate because there are none.
[00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:22.892]  And even before Pelosi flubbed her speech and regained the gavel, the Associated Press reported Representative Brad Sherman intends to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump.
[00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:33.520]  The LA Times had reported that Sherman's measure will accuse Trump of obstruction of justice in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, among other things.
[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:47.410]  So making sure that he, too, is not above it in the way that he has fired his investigator, or the way he's tried to pick his judges, the way that he's tried to, you know, get rid of his attorney general, or put in place an attorney general that would try and end the Mueller investigation.
[00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:57.216]  So I think it's really explaining to the American people that investigations matter, whether it's upholding the Constitution, the rule of law, or issues that affect them at their kitchen table.
[00:03:57.477 --> 00:04:02.300]  President Trump reminded the American people that the case for the wall had not met defeat.
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.860]  You can call it a barrier.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.061]  You can call it whatever you want.
[00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:07.882]  But essentially, we need protection in our country.
[00:04:07.922 --> 00:04:09.322]  We're going to make it good.
[00:04:10.463 --> 00:04:12.063]  The people of our country want it.
[00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:26.628]  I have never had so much support as I have in the last week over my stance for border security, for border control, and for, frankly, the wall or the barrier.
[00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:35.255]  I have never had anything like it in terms of calls coming in, in terms of people writing in and tweeting and doing whatever they have to do.
[00:04:35.295 --> 00:04:36.776]  I've never had this much support.
[00:04:36.856 --> 00:04:42.681]  However, Pelosi and company passed a plan in the House to reopen the government without funding the wall.
[00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:45.785]  The fact is, a wall is an immorality.
[00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:48.049]  It's not who we are as a nation.
[00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:54.037]  And this is not a wall between Mexico and the United States that the president is creating here.
[00:04:54.498 --> 00:04:58.244]  It's a wall between reality and his constituents.
[00:04:58.704 --> 00:05:03.546]  Of course, Pelosi says this, knowing the immoral crimes against American citizens.
[00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:06.568]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits... Defeat the globalists.
[00:05:07.068 --> 00:05:08.248]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:09.869]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:11.430]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.612]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:17.252 --> 00:05:20.454]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:29.143]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:30.064 --> 00:05:39.434]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:42.137]  We've already changed the world together.
[00:05:42.958 --> 00:05:49.961]  With our laser focus, do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:54.283]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:57.605]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[00:05:57.745 --> 00:06:04.148]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:09.932]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:10.432 --> 00:06:15.654]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:25.337 --> 00:06:34.780]  Well, it's the first day of the full new Congress, and the addled, dementia-ridden crime boss
[00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:45.986]  Nancy Pelosi has wasted no time with her cohorts as the Democratic Party moves into high gear to start the impeachment process of President Trump.
[00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:50.589]  And of course that would start in the House with a vote for the indictment.
[00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.771]  And then that would go to the Senate.
[00:06:54.252 --> 00:06:57.394]  One branch of government trying to remove the head of another branch of government.
[00:06:58.775 --> 00:07:11.220]  And if President Trump doesn't take action against these criminals, and he has the authority, he has the executive, it's a battle between sections of government, then he will deserve to be removed by these criminals.
[00:07:14.002 --> 00:07:25.887]  But looking at that collection of garbage yesterday on the Democratic side, the clown suits that the people were wearing, the bizarre mentally ill faces,
[00:07:26.744 --> 00:07:39.707]  You would think that it was a collection of homeless people who had been taken to a shopping mall by some joke reality show and dressed up in cartoon fancy suits.
[00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:54.151]  I mean, the Republicans have got their own problems, but the Democrats are a group of low-IQ, mentally ill criminals who've been put in place by megacorporations that have bought and paid for them
[00:07:56.465 --> 00:07:59.367]  So that they know they will do their exact bidding.
[00:08:01.228 --> 00:08:08.573]  Now, I got to the office a while ago today, but I didn't come sit in the chair until the broadcast had already started.
[00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:19.661]  And that's because I've been doing a lot of research on the Globalist Master Plan.
[00:08:21.882 --> 00:08:23.804]  And I've studied it in great detail.
[00:08:24.528 --> 00:08:38.678]  Not just what they put on the surface, but what their founding documents are and what their real beliefs are and what they actually follow and what they actually stand for and what they actually believe.
[00:08:42.661 --> 00:08:49.947]  And I've told listeners that my biggest blind spot is that I don't watch a lot of movies.
[00:08:51.442 --> 00:08:53.043]  And I don't watch a lot of popular culture.
[00:08:53.083 --> 00:08:53.904]  I study news.
[00:08:54.644 --> 00:08:55.665]  I study technology.
[00:08:55.765 --> 00:08:56.645]  I study history.
[00:08:56.725 --> 00:08:57.726]  I study developments.
[00:09:00.028 --> 00:09:06.112]  But I tend to shy away from pop culture because there's so much programming in it.
[00:09:08.373 --> 00:09:13.256]  And it's so incredibly overt that it's painful.
[00:09:14.097 --> 00:09:20.201]  And the little bit of time that I'm not working, I choose not to look at it.
[00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:27.508]  Or I go into escapism and try to watch the good, the bad, and the ugly or something like that.
[00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:37.070]  I'm going to come in and work basically all day tomorrow for my children and for myself and for you.
[00:09:38.531 --> 00:09:40.771]  And I'm doing it not because I'm some wonderful hero.
[00:09:42.172 --> 00:09:47.533]  I'm doing it because I want to survive and I want to try to control my own destiny.
[00:09:47.673 --> 00:09:50.534]  And there is no doubt
[00:09:52.196 --> 00:10:12.588]  That there is a scientific elite on this planet who are in competition with each other, but only in their competition to become absolutely dominant and to then carry out the orderly extinction, they'd call it obsolete, of the species.
[00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:17.339]  And that's a fact.
[00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:24.542]  And so, we can play the bizarre, bug-eyed Democrat-Islamicist, saying we're going to impeach that mother-effer.
[00:10:24.963 --> 00:10:31.565]  And we can play the bizarre Nancy Pelosi daughter on TV saying, my mother will cut the President's head off and he'll never know it.
[00:10:32.786 --> 00:10:35.987]  We can go through all these incredibly interesting clips and show it.
[00:10:37.248 --> 00:10:38.088]  The huge train wreck.
[00:10:39.465 --> 00:10:53.174]  You know, women from Islamic countries coming here and waving Palestinian and Islamic flags on election night and not even allowed to serve in government in most Muslim countries or drive cars.
[00:10:53.355 --> 00:10:57.597]  And they don't come here to try to get us to put pressure on those nations to free women.
[00:10:57.677 --> 00:10:58.118]  No, no.
[00:10:58.738 --> 00:11:06.944]  They come here and wear hijabs and go to our public schools and teach our little girls how to wear them like it's a fetishized, cool, feminist thing.
[00:11:16.744 --> 00:11:17.464]  So it's a plan.
[00:11:19.085 --> 00:11:20.525]  Yeah, I remember what they reported on last week.
[00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:25.527]  Women's march in mostly white city canceled for being too white.
[00:11:26.467 --> 00:11:27.127]  Print me that again.
[00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:27.847]  I never covered that.
[00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:28.808]  I saw that last week.
[00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:42.792]  And the Islamic people that run it, like Linda Sorcerer, are such incredible racists that they said, you know, we're not having it because we've got a list of who's coming and they're almost all white and white people are inherently bad.
[00:11:45.489 --> 00:11:47.689]  That is total weaponization of culture.
[00:11:49.410 --> 00:12:03.173]  Linda Sorcerer's mother, of course, calls for... She writes top white papers legitimizing around the world the genital mutilation of little girls.
[00:12:07.253 --> 00:12:07.793]  Think about that.
[00:12:09.434 --> 00:12:13.795]  And that's... She's a feminist leader who doesn't say a word about the hijab.
[00:12:13.835 --> 00:12:15.115]  In fact, she criticized
[00:12:16.365 --> 00:12:30.858]  Women in an Iranian movement who took their hijabs off, because you can be beaten or killed for that, and she said, you're just trying to get attention, wow, valiantly against a regime that can kill them, and has killed many.
[00:12:31.438 --> 00:12:34.581]  She's saying, you get that hijab back on your head, woman.
[00:12:38.018 --> 00:12:42.542]  And of course, she's linked to the father of the New Mexico jihadi who allegedly trained kids to shoot up schools.
[00:12:42.882 --> 00:12:44.403]  But the police just let them all go.
[00:12:44.463 --> 00:12:46.324]  They said, oh, you got a dead kid in here.
[00:12:46.925 --> 00:12:48.426]  Witnesses said he was tortured to death.
[00:12:51.809 --> 00:12:52.569]  It's your religion.
[00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:53.150]  It's Islam.
[00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.532]  Just like in Europe, they say, you know, Muslims are allowed to rape little kids.
[00:12:56.612 --> 00:12:57.353]  It's their culture.
[00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:00.595]  But see, I'm digressing.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.621]  I'm digressing.
[00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.972]  Because all of this is just window dressing.
[00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:18.179]  I know what their master plan is.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.881]  I know exactly what it is.
[00:13:21.903 --> 00:13:26.388]  And I also know that they are going into the final phase before they go operational.
[00:13:27.409 --> 00:13:29.251]  Everything else we've seen just been a beta test.
[00:13:34.642 --> 00:13:40.425]  And we're going to see things unfold in civilization the likes of which we have never witnessed before.
[00:13:40.825 --> 00:13:44.306]  Now I want to be very, very clear about this when we come back.
[00:13:50.789 --> 00:13:58.132]  The globalist technocrats have a dashboard, a control panel of ongoing mass experiments.
[00:14:01.654 --> 00:14:02.114]  They have
[00:14:03.328 --> 00:14:07.732]  Crystal Ball Computer Systems, actually called Crystal Ball.
[00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:12.336]  Palantir is another name for Crystal Ball.
[00:14:15.078 --> 00:14:19.782]  Where they can predict the future with exact precision.
[00:14:21.343 --> 00:14:25.086]  That means they can also manipulate the future.
[00:14:25.106 --> 00:14:27.308]  And I've talked about that for 15 years.
[00:14:27.388 --> 00:14:28.289]  It's mainstream news now.
[00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:33.971]  That's only one facet to this.
[00:14:34.511 --> 00:14:36.954]  We know where they're taking us.
[00:14:37.054 --> 00:14:40.196]  We know what they're doing in San Francisco.
[00:14:41.017 --> 00:14:42.458]  We know the group they're in.
[00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:46.582]  We know the plan.
[00:14:47.403 --> 00:14:49.104]  We know what they're partaking of.
[00:14:51.487 --> 00:14:53.889]  And so tomorrow I'm going to expose
[00:14:55.461 --> 00:15:01.603]  The DMT cult in San Francisco that runs Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter, everything.
[00:15:02.764 --> 00:15:05.125]  And what their master plan for the earth is.
[00:15:05.165 --> 00:15:07.826]  Because the Muslims aren't the number one threat.
[00:15:08.486 --> 00:15:10.147]  The Chi-Coms aren't the number one threat.
[00:15:11.947 --> 00:15:21.251]  Silicon Valley, and who they work for, and who they are, and what they've done, and who they're in communication with, is the number one threat.
[00:15:22.792 --> 00:15:23.412]  Now let's be clear.
[00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:27.952]  That's who the entity chose to make contact with.
[00:15:30.474 --> 00:15:34.958]  That's why everybody else has got to bow to it, because the advanced technology is coming out of there.
[00:15:35.859 --> 00:15:37.040]  They got a dimensional gate.
[00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:43.625]  And China has been picked by this group to be the group that takes over the planet.
[00:15:45.647 --> 00:15:47.228]  They mean business.
[00:15:47.248 --> 00:15:49.811]  And their business
[00:15:51.676 --> 00:15:58.980]  Is absolutely dumbing you down, torturing you, sucking your psyche out, before you die a horrible death of cancer.
[00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:01.742]  That's Tim Cook's goal, is murdering you and your family.
[00:16:02.502 --> 00:16:04.763]  Bacon lovers, we ship free!
[00:16:06.384 --> 00:16:07.505]  We're ending the year.
[00:16:07.825 --> 00:16:09.586]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[00:16:09.666 --> 00:16:10.607]  It's been an insane year.
[00:16:11.907 --> 00:16:19.432]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming, and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else, because of one thing.
[00:16:20.552 --> 00:16:31.503]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers, understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[00:16:32.544 --> 00:16:36.588]  And that the globalists wouldn't be trying to shut us down.
[00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:40.692]  If we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[00:16:40.712 --> 00:16:46.175]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[00:16:46.735 --> 00:16:48.856]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[00:16:49.196 --> 00:16:51.157]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[00:16:52.818 --> 00:16:54.718]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[00:16:54.738 --> 00:16:57.099]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:00.601]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[00:17:01.961 --> 00:17:05.043]  But our aircraft didn't have radar.
[00:17:07.421 --> 00:17:18.528]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[00:17:18.748 --> 00:17:29.255]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[00:17:30.336 --> 00:17:36.360]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it, that they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:44.453]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[00:17:44.473 --> 00:17:50.475]  Footage we're showing is Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[00:17:50.895 --> 00:17:54.436]  That's a separate battle.
[00:17:54.656 --> 00:18:01.959]  And so, they would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[00:18:02.459 --> 00:18:05.200]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[00:18:06.107 --> 00:18:11.488]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flack, comes from that.
[00:18:12.348 --> 00:18:27.132]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flack is, and we find out where the biggest attack is, and what pisses them off the most, and lo and behold,
[00:18:28.949 --> 00:18:32.212]  That turns out to be the most accurate information.
[00:18:32.272 --> 00:18:36.115]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[00:18:37.225 --> 00:18:46.068]  I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[00:18:46.468 --> 00:18:47.849]  We've got whatever the best is.
[00:18:47.889 --> 00:18:59.493]  I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[00:18:59.693 --> 00:19:01.414]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:08.574]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out.
[00:19:09.429 --> 00:19:10.690]  Until January 1st.
[00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.191]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support.
[00:19:13.731 --> 00:19:16.613]  Selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[00:19:17.113 --> 00:19:20.595]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[00:19:21.335 --> 00:19:22.456]  Free shipping store-wide.
[00:19:22.476 --> 00:19:24.397]  50 to 75% off everything.
[00:19:25.237 --> 00:19:27.038]  Double Patriot points on your next order.
[00:19:27.418 --> 00:19:28.679]  And a free t-shirt with every order.
[00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:32.341]  That is extended, but only a few days left until...
[00:19:33.627 --> 00:19:34.447]  The end of this year.
[00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:47.134]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping, and a free t-shirt, and of course, so many other great items.
[00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:52.957]  And in fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver or something like that.
[00:19:52.997 --> 00:19:58.660]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there, a true 360 win.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.521]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:02.342]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:32.034]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:41.409 --> 00:20:50.695]  Let me give you a little hint that what I'm gonna be breaking down tomorrow when I come up here all day and work on a very special, say, 10-minute report that'll be airing Sunday.
[00:20:51.416 --> 00:20:53.917]  Or I may just decide to go live tomorrow and put it out.
[00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:58.921]  Just watch InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com as this breaks.
[00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:01.282]  But I've got enough of the pieces to be 100% sure
[00:21:03.184 --> 00:21:16.070]  And I'm ready to start getting into the next phase of what the Globals are going to do in specifics, who they are and what they want to build, and what I believe is going to be done to them after they have completed the project.
[00:21:19.412 --> 00:21:26.875]  But if you look at the heads of Google, the heads of Apple, the heads of Twitter, these are whacked out, drugged out prisoners.
[00:21:28.316 --> 00:21:30.997]  They are in a very serious drug cult.
[00:21:32.881 --> 00:21:40.083]  If you look at Heaven's Gate, he was a big computer programmer and involved with some of these people in the 60s and 70s that set this up.
[00:21:40.663 --> 00:21:43.784]  He just got whacked out and went and started his own cult.
[00:21:46.825 --> 00:22:01.369]  And it just shows that the drugs these people are taking, they have then communally had some type of mass hallucination or there's some type of psychological compressed
[00:22:03.462 --> 00:22:09.506]  It's an instinct in epigenetics that every culture and every group keeps manifesting this blueprint.
[00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.513]  But the whole thing's been hiding in plain view forever.
[00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:28.060]  And the 60s and everything we've seen since then has been the revolution of this system coming in to control.
[00:22:29.541 --> 00:22:31.863]  And you see it foreshadowed by Arthur C. Clarke
[00:22:32.793 --> 00:22:39.599]  In childhood's end, you see it foreshadowed by the Thabian Socialists and their future societies.
[00:22:41.921 --> 00:23:00.536]  And I've got to sit back here, 170 years into their project, about 168 years into the first declarations of the project, and I've got to say they've had incredible success and had incredible advanced technology and knowledge
[00:23:04.318 --> 00:23:06.079]  Which means one of two things.
[00:23:10.962 --> 00:23:11.883]  One of two things.
[00:23:16.006 --> 00:23:27.053]  It either means the species is from another planet and we have compressed ancestral memories that we're then manifesting again of something that went wrong.
[00:23:27.073 --> 00:23:28.014]  We're repeating history.
[00:23:34.213 --> 00:23:44.901]  Or the information is being beamed, being transmitted through another dimension, or through this dimension, into the mind.
[00:23:44.921 --> 00:23:51.926]  And I've talked a lot about this.
[00:23:51.986 --> 00:23:52.866]  You have to understand something.
[00:23:53.527 --> 00:23:56.229]  They never attack me on this in the news.
[00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.272]  They'll make stuff up and say that I say that there's slave colonies on
[00:24:02.324 --> 00:24:03.565]  Mars, never said that.
[00:24:04.446 --> 00:24:08.529]  They'll say that I'm sending people to Sandy Hook parents' houses to harass them.
[00:24:08.749 --> 00:24:09.289]  Never did that.
[00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:15.914]  I'm on the cover of Texas Monthly this month, and it's just a huge list of lies.
[00:24:16.895 --> 00:24:18.396]  And you say, why would they do that?
[00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:22.760]  Why would they say a bunch of things I never said or never did?
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:29.345]  And then pick a few things I did say, but then act like I'm lying about it.
[00:24:30.125 --> 00:24:31.046]  Why would they do that?
[00:24:31.146 --> 00:24:31.907]  And it's because
[00:24:37.907 --> 00:24:55.713]  I have been exposing, just obliquely, the psychedelic DMT cult, that obviously has tried to recruit me many times, and has offices right here in Austin, run by the CIA.
[00:24:59.834 --> 00:25:03.336]  I think tomorrow I'm just, for my own safety, I think I'm going to release it all.
[00:25:03.876 --> 00:25:04.136]  You know what?
[00:25:04.716 --> 00:25:07.257]  I don't think I'm going to release it all tomorrow.
[00:25:09.022 --> 00:25:09.402]  You know what?
[00:25:09.462 --> 00:25:10.583]  I might just do it today.
[00:25:14.966 --> 00:25:15.887]  Because here's what I'm getting at.
[00:25:16.267 --> 00:25:18.049]  I have thousands of data points.
[00:25:20.711 --> 00:25:28.797]  I know about the secret project of the University of Texas to produce advanced mind control drugs that they're already testing on the student population on the black market.
[00:25:31.439 --> 00:25:32.820]  I know who represents them.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.441]  I know the entire plan.
[00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.090]  You see, you can't get away from me.
[00:25:43.392 --> 00:25:44.912]  I don't need to have sources.
[00:25:46.033 --> 00:25:50.235]  I have the sources, and then I ask the questions and get the answers, because people know I know.
[00:25:54.418 --> 00:26:12.588]  Oh yeah, three months ago, it was all over the news, CIA accidentally releases hundreds of pages about microwave radiation towers they were planning to put up in the 70s and conceal on universities to test mind control.
[00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:21.313]  But instead they just hide them in plain view, that has a secondary service of digital data transfer, and then you pay for it.
[00:26:28.786 --> 00:26:36.371]  You know, I think, because now I've been in this long enough, that I might just tell people too, because it's an important piece of the public, all about Stanley Kubrick tomorrow.
[00:26:37.772 --> 00:26:55.605]  Maybe I'll just tell you why Stanley Kubrick knew all those things, and why he got visited by the Department of Defense and the CIA and others, and how they asked him to stop making movies about the things he saw.
[00:27:06.104 --> 00:27:24.359]  Kubrick was so psychic that he was able to know the exact name and codes of B-52 nuclear launch scrambler systems without ever being told, without ever seeing it.
[00:27:27.762 --> 00:27:29.624]  And the big secret was he saw it.
[00:27:41.224 --> 00:27:49.451]  So... I'm not going to put up with this crap anymore and I'm going to release everything.
[00:27:51.733 --> 00:27:52.533]  And I'm going to do it tomorrow.
[00:27:54.115 --> 00:27:54.595]  So get ready.
[00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:09.628]  And all these little subcults, all these little groups that think they're part of the winning team because you've joined the system, the globalists hate your guts and want to kill you.
[00:28:10.697 --> 00:28:11.478]  And they are killing you.
[00:28:13.899 --> 00:28:19.943]  And you look at the slaves they've got in Congress, those Democrats particularly, and you look at the slaves in Hollywood, everybody ought to be thanking God.
[00:28:20.564 --> 00:28:21.985]  You're not part of Silicon Valley.
[00:28:22.545 --> 00:28:23.846]  You're not part of the Chi-Coms.
[00:28:23.886 --> 00:28:24.967]  You're not part of the EU.
[00:28:25.988 --> 00:28:37.776]  Everybody who's been taught to feel inadequate because you're not part of the system, you ought to thank God every day that you're not part of this devil system, because you are going to inherit the Earth when this thing has been destroyed.
[00:28:38.136 --> 00:28:39.177]  And it will be destroyed.
[00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:44.331]  It only acts on our free will, tricking us to give it power.
[00:28:45.111 --> 00:28:46.833]  But we're going to defeat it together.
[00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:49.596]  It has a name.
[00:28:53.981 --> 00:28:56.524]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:28:57.004 --> 00:28:58.046]  Newswars.com.
[00:28:58.606 --> 00:28:59.687]  Infowars.com.
[00:29:00.168 --> 00:29:01.529]  Tomorrow's future, today.
[00:29:04.518 --> 00:29:08.860]  The last eight years we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[00:29:09.821 --> 00:29:15.744]  And the entire time I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[00:29:16.204 --> 00:29:25.649]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.330]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[00:29:27.891 --> 00:29:30.192]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[00:29:30.772 --> 00:29:46.921]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes, everybody knows about it on so many fronts, and helps a lot of people.
[00:29:47.742 --> 00:29:56.007]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear, and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[00:29:56.883 --> 00:30:16.769]  But now they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[00:30:17.529 --> 00:30:19.770]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation.
[00:30:20.788 --> 00:30:24.491]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[00:30:24.511 --> 00:30:25.171]  They're patriots.
[00:30:25.551 --> 00:30:36.859]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[00:30:37.399 --> 00:30:38.240]  You drop ship it.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:38.960]  You get it out.
[00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:40.041]  You have the website.
[00:30:40.662 --> 00:30:41.262]  I promote it.
[00:30:41.442 --> 00:30:42.323]  I send people there.
[00:30:42.603 --> 00:30:45.545]  And that way, they're getting the very best from the experts.
[00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:49.648]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[00:30:50.802 --> 00:31:00.424]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[00:31:01.184 --> 00:31:05.945]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:14.307]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[00:31:15.526 --> 00:31:25.636]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:27.759]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:28.359]  I've researched it.
[00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:33.865]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us the last six years.
[00:31:33.885 --> 00:31:35.286]  It's gotten really crazy the last two.
[00:31:36.107 --> 00:31:48.012]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[00:31:49.312 --> 00:31:57.176]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[00:31:57.856 --> 00:32:14.084]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all because they have more than 40 products.
[00:32:14.445 --> 00:32:17.206]  Now remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[00:32:17.406 --> 00:32:18.407]  They've tried to shut us down.
[00:32:19.207 --> 00:32:20.388]  They've tried to boycott us.
[00:32:20.428 --> 00:32:21.208]  They've tried to sue us.
[00:32:21.729 --> 00:32:28.212]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move, not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[00:32:28.432 --> 00:32:36.197]  We're still going to do that at themforwarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[00:32:36.297 --> 00:32:38.118]  And this is the first big one.
[00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:39.339]  So I'm very excited.
[00:32:39.379 --> 00:32:40.159]  Be sure and go there.
[00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:46.863]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[00:32:46.903 --> 00:32:49.365]  So, highest quality, the lowest prices.
[00:32:49.825 --> 00:32:55.589]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at WashingtonReserve.com, and you're helping fund the InfoWar the whole time.
[00:32:55.609 --> 00:32:59.832]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.021 --> 00:33:22.781]  Big Brother.
[00:33:24.142 --> 00:33:25.402]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:26.502 --> 00:33:28.023]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:29.503 --> 00:33:30.483]  You want answers?
[00:33:31.423 --> 00:33:32.404]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:33.324 --> 00:33:39.625]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.625 --> 00:33:43.406]  Alright, coming up...
[00:33:45.302 --> 00:33:48.367]  Around the time this broadcast ends today and the war room starts at 3 p.m.
[00:33:48.387 --> 00:33:53.275]  Central with Owen Schroer, Roger Shiller and others, I decided to do something I've never done before.
[00:33:53.295 --> 00:33:59.024]  I came in today, I was looking at all the news and I said I'm not gonna look at all the news right now.
[00:34:00.267 --> 00:34:06.349]  I want to have a meeting with just a few of the guys that were already meeting me here to shoot a special report on a whole other subject.
[00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:17.512]  And I said, come in here, record this, because I want to come up here tomorrow and do a big research project on this and get this maximum importance transmission out.
[00:34:19.793 --> 00:34:24.114]  And about 15 minutes of the 30-minute conversation, I said, I want you to dump this out raw.
[00:34:27.073 --> 00:34:30.336]  Because I was not intending halfway through to even have anybody ever hear it.
[00:34:30.356 --> 00:34:34.700]  But then I thought, you know, I'm just going to start putting our meetings out on air.
[00:34:36.621 --> 00:34:38.063]  Because there's nothing to hide around here.
[00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:45.589]  And the guys that were in the meeting were good with that.
[00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.751]  They all had a lot of good points they added.
[00:34:47.771 --> 00:34:50.633]  And the most important thing that got said was said by
[00:34:51.647 --> 00:35:05.329]  I think Rob do, he said, what'll be great about putting this out raw, ahead of our big complex report, that's all documentation heavy, is it'll spur everybody else to go look into what we're talking about, and they always find stuff even more incredible than we found.
[00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:06.290]  And that's true.
[00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:18.692]  And that's what our broadcast really did, was the first ever, going back, I wasn't even doing this 18 years ago, but the bandwidth got so expensive that I could only do it in limited times, before YouTube came along.
[00:35:19.725 --> 00:35:31.651]  Is I would have a webcam, but instead of you just watching me sit there and talk, I'd aim it at news articles or photos or play a clip off my DVD player with a TV and, you know, aim it at that.
[00:35:32.872 --> 00:35:38.375]  And that's kind of how this evolution started of making radio TV and TV radio.
[00:35:39.476 --> 00:35:40.476]  So it would be interactive.
[00:35:42.517 --> 00:35:45.359]  But then sometimes it's good to just talk and not put
[00:35:46.668 --> 00:35:55.393]  100 graphics or documents over because it almost, even though we're showing you the proof of what we're saying, it almost loses the depth because people know I'm not lying.
[00:35:55.413 --> 00:36:02.336]  That's why the whole corporate media tells you I'm a liar and I'm not for real and I'll betray you because they know I'm for real.
[00:36:04.077 --> 00:36:05.098]  And they know I can't be bought.
[00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:07.819]  And that really pisses them off.
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:14.583]  So, major foreshadowing today
[00:36:16.522 --> 00:36:17.342]  At the end of the show.
[00:36:18.662 --> 00:36:22.583]  And what crystallized all this was that it was already crystallized.
[00:36:23.483 --> 00:36:24.624]  I'd already shot a report.
[00:36:27.144 --> 00:36:28.204]  Last Friday.
[00:36:30.825 --> 00:36:33.545]  At the 360 bridge and a local park.
[00:36:34.906 --> 00:36:36.566]  Dealing with the very subject.
[00:36:38.066 --> 00:36:40.207]  And saying it's the most important project we've done.
[00:36:41.847 --> 00:36:42.307]  And then.
[00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:46.088]  This morning.
[00:36:49.761 --> 00:36:53.042]  I said, man, I'm sick of watching Fox News while I'm on the elliptical.
[00:36:54.182 --> 00:36:57.763]  Everybody keeps calling it dumb and stupid, but boy, they're all talking about it.
[00:36:57.823 --> 00:37:00.003]  And it's been seen like 60 million times now.
[00:37:00.803 --> 00:37:03.144]  Netflix and Bird Box.
[00:37:03.944 --> 00:37:05.704]  I know the inside baseball on Sandra Bullock.
[00:37:05.724 --> 00:37:06.825]  She's not a very nice person.
[00:37:07.065 --> 00:37:07.625]  Very fake.
[00:37:08.145 --> 00:37:09.205]  I don't really like Sandra Bullock.
[00:37:09.445 --> 00:37:11.426]  So I was like, I can't stand watching Sandra Bullock.
[00:37:12.326 --> 00:37:14.506]  But I said, let me watch it.
[00:37:15.687 --> 00:37:16.947]  And I was 10 minutes in.
[00:37:19.414 --> 00:37:24.135]  And I called my personal trainer up, and I said, have you seen this movie?
[00:37:24.195 --> 00:37:24.876]  And he said, yeah.
[00:37:27.236 --> 00:37:28.817]  And I said, it's really about this, isn't it?
[00:37:28.857 --> 00:37:29.897]  And he goes, well, yeah.
[00:37:30.557 --> 00:37:32.278]  And I said, let me guess, does this happen?
[00:37:32.538 --> 00:37:33.258]  And he goes, yeah.
[00:37:35.578 --> 00:37:36.919]  And he goes, how do you know that?
[00:37:36.939 --> 00:37:37.899]  Have you read the synopsis?
[00:37:37.939 --> 00:37:39.119]  And I said, no, I know.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.081]  So I haven't even seen it yet, and I know what it is.
[00:37:45.821 --> 00:37:47.302]  And everybody's asking, what's the mystery?
[00:37:47.322 --> 00:37:48.182]  What's killing everybody?
[00:37:52.496 --> 00:38:06.104]  I'll tell you, coming up today, but that's only, I'm going to use Bird Box as the carrier.
[00:38:06.904 --> 00:38:11.087]  Kind of like the black plague was on fleas that were on rats.
[00:38:12.344 --> 00:38:16.688]  And people saw cats around the black plague and they thought cats were causing the plague.
[00:38:16.708 --> 00:38:20.771]  No, it was the cats were actually killing the rats, but it didn't matter.
[00:38:21.952 --> 00:38:23.873]  Now, the globalists call me a disease.
[00:38:23.913 --> 00:38:26.596]  They call me a virus that must be stopped because I'm the cure to what they do.
[00:38:28.057 --> 00:38:29.178]  I reverse engineer what they've done.
[00:38:29.198 --> 00:38:32.020]  I've not decided to run and hide or join them.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.701]  Everybody else runs and hides or joins them.
[00:38:34.362 --> 00:38:35.443]  Runs and hides or joins them.
[00:38:36.764 --> 00:38:40.627]  But we've assembled a group, an audience who's not an audience, who cares.
[00:38:43.166 --> 00:38:49.447]  Who has a life force, has a connection to God, has discernment, and understands what we're up against.
[00:38:49.727 --> 00:38:52.128]  And the system is not like that at all.
[00:38:53.308 --> 00:38:57.949]  Just remember, it's got followers and weaklings that it chose to put in positions.
[00:38:59.309 --> 00:39:01.210]  It doesn't like honorable, strong people.
[00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:02.790]  It doesn't like strong men or women.
[00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.550]  It doesn't like people that are free thinkers.
[00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.871]  It wants compliant, pliable slaves.
[00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:10.320]  For what it's building.
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:18.663]  And it'll give you all the fancy cars and all the baubles and all the trinkets and all the earthly fake power of being a fake little king.
[00:39:19.263 --> 00:39:20.123]  But you won't be real.
[00:39:21.643 --> 00:39:25.965]  And only now, and I already know all this, but now I completely have proven it.
[00:39:27.165 --> 00:39:28.005]  It's documented.
[00:39:32.627 --> 00:39:33.687]  And long story short.
[00:39:36.108 --> 00:39:37.548]  They have the technology.
[00:39:39.622 --> 00:39:56.052]  Right now with regular flicker rates on televisions and regular cell phone radiation from the tower in certain proximity to make people kill themselves.
[00:39:56.252 --> 00:39:57.893]  Nasty classified and I'll be covering.
[00:40:00.075 --> 00:40:02.456]  But when 5G goes in every 5,200 yards
[00:40:06.756 --> 00:40:12.657]  It's all public fact that they're not just putting a spy grid in, this big public service of this 5G we all need.
[00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:24.919]  They are putting in the tested, perfected mind control towers, that by the way, on record, just like Bird Box, kills you.
[00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:28.400]  But you don't just kill yourself right away, it takes time.
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:36.321]  It scrambles your DNA, it scrambles your genome, and Wired Magazine, LA Times admits, it kills you.
[00:40:39.048 --> 00:40:39.588]  It kills you.
[00:40:41.269 --> 00:40:42.049]  And they even tell you.
[00:40:42.089 --> 00:40:44.651]  See, because metaphysically, they have one rule.
[00:40:46.351 --> 00:40:49.493]  Just like the Bible says, Satan has to go before God and say, can I do this?
[00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:50.013]  Can I do that?
[00:40:50.453 --> 00:40:54.795]  And God routinely says, no, because you've got to get them to do it through free will.
[00:40:56.176 --> 00:40:58.917]  So the devil is bound, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:00.898 --> 00:41:03.459]  And the devil can only trot, you know, the fallen ones.
[00:41:03.539 --> 00:41:04.600]  He fell on the planet.
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.720]  He can't get off.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.901]  He's in prison here with us.
[00:41:08.692 --> 00:41:20.802]  And he wants to get us to build a world government system with a cashless planetary system and a whole program of total control, but he needs us to opt in.
[00:41:24.725 --> 00:41:26.046]  And then he can't help himself.
[00:41:26.386 --> 00:41:31.370]  At the minute he cheats and stops using free will, he gets stopped.
[00:41:34.672 --> 00:41:34.993]  You're here.
[00:41:36.468 --> 00:41:37.769]  And so how could anyone not?
[00:41:37.789 --> 00:41:54.840]  I mean, I knew in three minutes watching Bird Box that it was shell phone 5G radiation that someone's hacked into and that after the grid falls, how they had to weaponize it, that a certain percentage got given a program to be hunter killers and cleanse the earth.
[00:41:59.127 --> 00:42:02.708]  And I was sitting there talking to Pat and I said, let me guess, it doesn't kill everybody.
[00:42:02.788 --> 00:42:06.009]  Some live and they're going around killing people to cleanse the earth.
[00:42:06.369 --> 00:42:08.350]  And he said, yeah, that's exactly how do you know that?
[00:42:08.370 --> 00:42:14.492]  And I said, well, it's in the New York Times, the Washington Post last week that we're going to cleanse the earth and kill all the humans and a great cleanse is coming.
[00:42:14.892 --> 00:42:21.754]  And so see, once the grid goes down, you'll need enough programmed people to go out and kill whoever's left.
[00:42:24.585 --> 00:42:25.666]  And see, that's a metaphor, too.
[00:42:25.686 --> 00:42:28.488]  If they just turn the power off, 90% will die within a few months.
[00:42:29.429 --> 00:42:31.710]  Because you'll have roving bands that kill everybody.
[00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:39.316]  Within 15 days, either 100% of people commit suicide, or they become cannibals and collapse the situation.
[00:42:41.437 --> 00:42:42.978]  So we don't need to mind-control people.
[00:42:43.018 --> 00:42:44.379]  Just turn the lights off for 15 days.
[00:42:44.419 --> 00:42:44.900]  You'll get that.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.482]  But see, the shape of things to come is here.
[00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:50.504]  And they're now doing final prep.
[00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:53.146]  But it doesn't mean they're going to launch that op.
[00:42:54.036 --> 00:42:56.977]  This past weekend, I traveled up to Omaha, Nebraska to visit my wife's father.
[00:43:12.295 --> 00:43:16.278]  And while I was there, I had a chance to read the Omaha World Herald Living Section.
[00:43:17.699 --> 00:43:22.502]  And the entire thing is an anti-family, anti-American diatribe.
[00:43:23.043 --> 00:43:25.304]  But it's all packaged very, very slickly.
[00:43:26.185 --> 00:43:36.492]  Here's just one example from the Sunday, December 23, 2018, Section E Living Area, which should be how to not live.
[00:43:37.253 --> 00:43:43.556]  It's all about how to spend time watching football with your family and how great that is, and how to set up the flicker ray on your television, right?
[00:43:44.096 --> 00:43:44.716]  I'm not kidding.
[00:43:45.677 --> 00:43:51.159]  But beneath that, there's an article, Breaking the Expectations of Boys Will Be Boys.
[00:43:52.339 --> 00:43:55.321]  It's a Washington Post editorial staff article.
[00:43:55.741 --> 00:43:58.122]  It's a very, very large syndicated column.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.121]  And I knew what I was going to read before I read it.
[00:44:01.682 --> 00:44:03.904]  Boys aren't graduating high school or college.
[00:44:03.964 --> 00:44:05.125]  And boys are depressed.
[00:44:05.205 --> 00:44:07.207]  And boys can't get jobs.
[00:44:07.307 --> 00:44:09.869]  And you know what the problem is?
[00:44:10.109 --> 00:44:11.130]  Boys are boys.
[00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:15.514]  We need to teach them how to wear pink nail polish and how to be in dance class.
[00:44:16.414 --> 00:44:16.675]  That's right.
[00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:18.656]  We need to teach them how to be like girls.
[00:44:20.396 --> 00:44:25.805]  Because girls have been more compliant with the changes in society, and that's how we fix the problem.
[00:44:26.025 --> 00:44:31.094]  He worries that the people they interview in here, that their son is playing with Nerf guns.
[00:44:32.822 --> 00:44:35.684]  And then it's just beyond sick.
[00:44:36.805 --> 00:44:40.308]  What they've done is build a world that's anti-male and anti-family.
[00:44:40.788 --> 00:44:45.071]  What they've done is target our boys with Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs.
[00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:51.936]  What they've done is set up systems that persecute the idea of masculinity, toxic masculinity.
[00:44:52.657 --> 00:44:58.581]  It's well known that when the Romans or any other group took over a population, they would kill all the men down to age 12 or so.
[00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:04.327]  Because women are compliant with an authoritarian takeover on average.
[00:45:04.347 --> 00:45:09.090]  And they would only allow little boys to go on and survive.
[00:45:10.549 --> 00:45:10.869]  I don't know.
[00:45:34.748 --> 00:45:36.809]  Made sure everybody stayed in line.
[00:45:37.169 --> 00:45:40.150]  And then you read this sick, sick evil.
[00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:44.912]  Where the system has set it up to put men into crisis and women as well.
[00:45:45.472 --> 00:45:47.153]  The whole human species is under attack.
[00:45:48.502 --> 00:45:55.405]  And the article by the end gets into gender and how we have to get rid of gender roles because that's why our boys are in trouble.
[00:45:56.185 --> 00:46:04.688]  The very same technocrats, the very same eugenicists who bragged in the 30s that they would set this up, people like
[00:46:06.593 --> 00:46:11.636]  Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, the very same people that bragged about it, have now brought us to that point.
[00:46:12.576 --> 00:46:26.024]  We're three or four generations into this and now those that helped create the crisis, those that helped saw off our legs, are now going to help saw off our arms and help chemically sterilize our young boys.
[00:46:26.885 --> 00:46:28.005]  That's how we're going to save them.
[00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:33.428]  Just like LBJ bragged 45 years ago that he'd have black people
[00:46:34.589 --> 00:46:40.411]  Voting Republican for 100 years by paying black women to not have men in the house or they wouldn't get their welfare.
[00:46:41.391 --> 00:46:42.391]  And that's how they operate.
[00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:46.632]  The article is sickening and it's titled, Breaking the Expectation of Boys Will Be Boys.
[00:46:47.193 --> 00:46:52.054]  Parents want their sons to be who he is, not what society should say it should be.
[00:46:52.174 --> 00:46:55.415]  But they're the ones saying that you're not really a boy.
[00:46:55.735 --> 00:46:59.016]  They're the ones destroying your identity while claiming they're protecting it.
[00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:03.397]  They're the ones telling you what to be while claiming they're defending your right to be what you want to be.
[00:47:06.596 --> 00:47:11.119]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.528 --> 00:47:30.812]  Live, raw, and unfiltered, it's The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:38.372]  Well, I'm getting ready in the next days and weeks to take everybody down to the deepest level of the rabbit hole.
[00:47:41.674 --> 00:47:52.479]  Rashida Tlaib, one of two new members, Islamic members of Congress, has wasted no time waving foreign flags at her celebration parties.
[00:47:52.599 --> 00:47:53.420]  Non-American flags.
[00:47:54.740 --> 00:48:00.363]  And, you know, we exported our factories and we imported the very most radical Muslims into the country.
[00:48:01.949 --> 00:48:06.870]  And surprise, surprise, the left and the fake family, you know, destroy the family feminists, love it!
[00:48:08.311 --> 00:48:11.391]  So you have a sickening alliance of hajib-wearing women.
[00:48:11.431 --> 00:48:25.595]  I mean, I go to restaurants, malls, North Austin, South Austin, West Austin, Hill Country, and I mean, I go in any restaurant now and there's women in full burqas taking spoonfuls of food and eating it under their... I mean, we're talking slits where their eyes are.
[00:48:26.513 --> 00:48:31.874]  Those are captured slaves who have had their genitals cut off, wearing a full slave outfit.
[00:48:33.854 --> 00:48:39.015]  If I walked in there in a Halloween mask of a gorilla, they'd ask me to leave.
[00:48:39.055 --> 00:48:40.035]  You're causing a disturbance.
[00:48:42.656 --> 00:48:44.396]  In fact, I got so many stunts I haven't pulled yet.
[00:48:44.776 --> 00:48:50.417]  I'm gonna start going to restaurants dressed like a gorilla, dressed like an alien, and then, you know, I'll be thrown out.
[00:48:50.617 --> 00:48:51.177]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:48:51.997 --> 00:48:55.158]  Those are... If you're watching on TV, that's a cross between a burka
[00:48:56.587 --> 00:48:57.187]  And a hijab.
[00:48:58.308 --> 00:49:01.869]  These women are wearing full burqas.
[00:49:04.809 --> 00:49:05.369]  All over Austin.
[00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.771]  And my daughters are with me a lot.
[00:49:09.791 --> 00:49:12.411]  I mean, they're with me 90% of the time.
[00:49:12.632 --> 00:49:14.192]  The media says I lost my kids, total lie.
[00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:21.174]  And... My daughters are like, what's that?
[00:49:25.339 --> 00:49:27.220]  I've even shot some video on my phone, I haven't aired it.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:28.781]  Everybody knows it, you see it everywhere.
[00:49:29.621 --> 00:49:30.162]  La Berka!
[00:49:35.985 --> 00:49:36.825]  La Nequib?
[00:49:37.506 --> 00:49:38.246]  La Hijib?
[00:49:39.127 --> 00:49:40.527]  That's a funny meme somebody put up.
[00:49:40.547 --> 00:49:43.609]  Yeah, it's for French, I get it.
[00:49:43.969 --> 00:49:45.190]  I tell ya, it's unbelievable.
[00:49:46.131 --> 00:49:53.975]  Yeah, the women I see in Austin are in between the total one, where it's like a fishnet over the face, and then breathing holes.
[00:49:55.868 --> 00:49:56.668]  And the one in the middle.
[00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:01.849]  And it's crazy, man.
[00:50:01.869 --> 00:50:04.250]  And you're sitting there eating dinner.
[00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:07.090]  A couple times they sat him right next to me.
[00:50:08.471 --> 00:50:14.372]  I mean, imagine if a Christian came in with his wife with a hood over their head.
[00:50:15.172 --> 00:50:22.074]  I mean, in fact, in Handmaid's Tale, that they've remade, it's the Christians that make women wear basically stuff over their hair and necks.
[00:50:22.374 --> 00:50:23.394]  And it's incredibly oppressive.
[00:50:24.212 --> 00:50:29.117]  So see, they create a simulation of what the Muslims do, projected onto Christians.
[00:50:29.237 --> 00:50:30.418]  I'm just so tired of it.
[00:50:31.139 --> 00:50:31.739]  Anyway, sorry.
[00:50:31.759 --> 00:50:35.763]  We have a lot of big guests coming up today.
[00:50:35.783 --> 00:50:42.129]  A lot going on, but new Congresswoman Talib goes off on Trump.
[00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:45.412]  We're going to impeach the mother effer.
[00:50:45.432 --> 00:50:46.193]  Here, let's go ahead and play that.
[00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:48.461]  I love you!
[00:50:48.922 --> 00:50:49.622]  And you win!
[00:50:50.042 --> 00:50:54.285]  And when your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won, bullies don't win.
[00:50:54.405 --> 00:50:55.666]  And I said, baby, they don't.
[00:50:55.946 --> 00:50:58.007]  Because we're going to go in there and we're going to impeach the mother******.
[00:50:58.548 --> 00:51:02.390]  But you won the Palestinian front.
[00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:06.272]  The night you won, and so did the other lady.
[00:51:07.193 --> 00:51:13.257]  And of course, they do, Islamists do, bottle their kids up with TNT and have them blow themselves up.
[00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:16.779]  So I guess when those bullies do kill innocent people, I guess they kind of win.
[00:51:18.871 --> 00:51:19.892]  So there's your new America.
[00:51:21.433 --> 00:51:25.196]  Empty burnout houses and 80% of the Muslims on welfare here.
[00:51:25.236 --> 00:51:28.239]  It's 90% in Europe and we owe them all something.
[00:51:28.759 --> 00:51:32.622]  By the way, I forgot to tell you guys, did you guys see the footage of the obese woman trying to climb over the wall yesterday?
[00:51:33.923 --> 00:51:34.524]  In California?
[00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:50.038]  It's just this, it's just this image of just the whole world's got to come here and we owe them something and that's the end of it and by golly, white people are bad, we're going to cancel the Lemons March because there's too many white people at it.
[00:51:51.159 --> 00:51:56.062]  And again, I'm not against people just because they're a Muslim or because they're black or because they're Hispanic or whatever.
[00:51:56.302 --> 00:52:05.588]  The point is the globalists, the Democrats are bringing these people in and green lighting them 100% to act however they want and do whatever they want and get away with whatever they want.
[00:52:07.481 --> 00:52:08.702]  And I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:52:08.722 --> 00:52:12.924]  And that's why I've been banned off all these platforms.
[00:52:12.944 --> 00:52:14.145]  But they'd already shadow banned me.
[00:52:20.129 --> 00:52:21.729]  And then we just got them to be honest about it.
[00:52:21.749 --> 00:52:32.556]  And then they thought, oh look, we were greenlit to get rid of Alex Jones, and now it's... Mainline Christians are being taken off Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and...
[00:52:33.553 --> 00:52:38.296]  Mainline conservative sites like PragerU have to file lawsuits and fight to even stay on YouTube.
[00:52:39.516 --> 00:52:41.117]  Franklin Graham, taken off.
[00:52:43.499 --> 00:52:48.281]  This is real authoritarianism, and the president's doing a lot of good things, and I'll talk about it next hour.
[00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:49.222]  He's done some bad things.
[00:52:49.782 --> 00:52:52.003]  But overall, you know a man by his enemies, he's a good guy.
[00:52:52.063 --> 00:53:00.248]  But I'll tell you, he's surrounded by traitors, and that's been illustrated by Kelly and Mattis leaving.
[00:53:01.297 --> 00:53:03.879]  Who won't execute anything he says?
[00:53:03.919 --> 00:53:22.235]  Well, of course, because there's the whole breakaway secret civilization out there and all the different myriad laboratories and research facilities that are doing all this illegal testing with DARPA and everything you can imagine that's beyond any science fiction horror movie you ever imagined.
[00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:28.647]  And if he ever gets to discover what's in all that, it's over.
[00:53:28.928 --> 00:53:31.410]  That's why they're blocking him on releasing classified information.
[00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:33.051]  He orders it, they just refuse.
[00:53:34.673 --> 00:53:38.936]  Because they've got a collection of traitors up there in Washington, in both parties.
[00:53:39.937 --> 00:53:46.022]  And the few people like Nunes or Jordan, who aren't cowards, get isolated and demonize themselves.
[00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:47.444]  How do you know when somebody's good?
[00:53:48.749 --> 00:53:51.090]  When they're trying like hell to get you cancelled.
[00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:52.470]  Michael Savage.
[00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:54.111]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:53:54.651 --> 00:53:55.351]  Alex Jones.
[00:53:55.731 --> 00:54:00.793]  Can't cancel Drudge unless you kill his URL, so they're always obsessing on him.
[00:54:00.833 --> 00:54:03.834]  But I've noticed the media's been being more friendly to Drudge now.
[00:54:03.854 --> 00:54:07.295]  I guess trying to court him or something, as they should have been doing the whole time.
[00:54:08.535 --> 00:54:10.756]  But this country is in a war for the future.
[00:54:11.136 --> 00:54:12.677]  This whole planet's in a war for the future.
[00:54:12.917 --> 00:54:13.717]  Let me stop right there.
[00:54:13.737 --> 00:54:16.278]  We have a special guest coming up I'll tell you about once we announce him.
[00:54:19.036 --> 00:54:29.962]  I have not really plugged the new products because there's no way to really do them justice.
[00:54:34.064 --> 00:54:35.285]  I think that's the best way to say it.
[00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:39.487]  The bottom line, just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[00:54:40.268 --> 00:54:46.031]  And if you support us at InfoWarsTore.com, you're going to get great products.
[00:54:47.788 --> 00:54:49.669]  And I see that as a byproduct.
[00:54:50.169 --> 00:54:57.531]  You're also going to get the main mission, somebody that's really going to take the globalist's task and really attack their core tenants.
[00:54:58.851 --> 00:55:05.613]  Even though when you do that, it's like beating a hive of vicious bees with a baseball bat.
[00:55:06.874 --> 00:55:09.155]  But I'm not just willing to do it.
[00:55:09.395 --> 00:55:13.656]  I want to, and not because I like pain, but because
[00:55:15.222 --> 00:55:17.863]  When I do this, my soul gets closer to God.
[00:55:20.184 --> 00:55:21.745]  When I don't do it, it gets further away.
[00:55:22.165 --> 00:55:26.948]  And I'm just swimming in this whole ether of consciousness towards that.
[00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:39.674]  And, you know, I think about the persecution I've gone through here in the third dimension, and it's
[00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:49.271]  Nothing, compared to what I've seen done to the people and the souls that have joined this evil.
[00:55:50.752 --> 00:55:54.332]  So, when I say that it's not even, people say, oh my God, how are you taking it?
[00:55:54.372 --> 00:55:54.932]  What's it like?
[00:55:55.272 --> 00:55:55.932]  It's really nothing.
[00:55:57.433 --> 00:56:04.834]  I mean, I have seen the dark side, let me tell you, and I'll do anything to be with God.
[00:56:09.895 --> 00:56:10.355]  Anything.
[00:56:14.665 --> 00:56:14.985]  Anything.
[00:56:18.147 --> 00:56:21.789]  You know, just like there's good things in the universe and there's bad things, everybody knows that.
[00:56:28.033 --> 00:56:29.294]  We have to be honest about it.
[00:56:30.294 --> 00:56:30.455]  So...
[00:56:31.687 --> 00:56:32.848]  I got a minute and a half till break.
[00:56:33.048 --> 00:56:34.469]  There's really not time to describe it.
[00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:36.651]  And I haven't even cut ads yet to do it justice.
[00:56:37.472 --> 00:56:43.697]  Um, we have told you they're trying to take away our capability, even sell products and to have our own shopping cart.
[00:56:43.737 --> 00:56:45.818]  They've not been successful, but they've tried like the devil.
[00:56:46.679 --> 00:56:47.220]  They are the devil.
[00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:47.840]  Wow.
[00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:48.461]  What a surprise.
[00:56:49.421 --> 00:56:50.422]  Fought like the devil.
[00:56:51.263 --> 00:56:54.606]  Got down on his level, but he gave up.
[00:56:56.627 --> 00:56:57.448]  Cause I never gave in.
[00:57:00.205 --> 00:57:02.647]  Got a bunch of the Keith Whitley song, but we should come back with that song.
[00:57:04.568 --> 00:57:06.530]  I fought like the devil, got down on his level.
[00:57:11.573 --> 00:57:22.982]  But I really don't have ways to describe how blessed we are that despite all the things they've done, I believe we'll only be stronger at the end of this.
[00:57:24.997 --> 00:57:27.698]  But I don't have the time to properly get into it.
[00:57:27.718 --> 00:57:30.959]  You should go do your own research and just know, whatever we bring you is the best.
[00:57:31.819 --> 00:57:38.301]  And you need to look up Washington's, with an S, washingtonsreserve.com.
[00:57:39.401 --> 00:57:43.642]  Because this is natural, organic, THC-free hemp.
[00:57:44.562 --> 00:57:49.144]  Extracted CBD oil for everything you can imagine under the sun.
[00:57:49.164 --> 00:57:50.064]  30 plus products.
[00:57:51.484 --> 00:57:52.245]  National company.
[00:57:52.425 --> 00:57:53.525]  Defeat the globalist!
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.522]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[00:58:01.882 --> 00:58:06.765]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[00:58:06.945 --> 00:58:08.666]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[00:58:08.766 --> 00:58:12.468]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[00:58:12.628 --> 00:58:14.630]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[00:58:14.690 --> 00:58:25.756]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[00:58:26.096 --> 00:58:28.718]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:29.938]  How about physical wealth?
[00:58:30.279 --> 00:58:32.340]  When I forget to pick my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.901]  We have X2.
[00:58:34.001 --> 00:58:39.264]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it to 12,000 feet.
[00:58:39.704 --> 00:58:41.245]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[00:58:41.425 --> 00:58:47.409]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize.
[00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:48.990]  And this other form of iodine,
[00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:51.852]  The other form, all three, so that it's better absorbable.
[00:58:51.932 --> 00:58:52.633]  That's X3.
[00:58:52.773 --> 00:58:54.234]  We have a limited supply of X2.
[00:58:54.275 --> 00:58:55.055]  It's our final run.
[00:58:55.315 --> 00:58:56.116]  But here are the headlines.
[00:58:56.677 --> 00:58:59.679]  How adding iodine to salt boosts an American IQ.
[00:58:59.899 --> 00:59:02.041]  That's Discovery Magazine, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:02.101 --> 00:59:03.803]  And then we've got the New York Times.
[00:59:04.003 --> 00:59:05.805]  Now again, this is from 12 years ago.
[00:59:06.405 --> 00:59:08.766]  Raising the world's IQ, the secret is salt.
[00:59:08.846 --> 00:59:09.307]  But it's not.
[00:59:09.327 --> 00:59:09.887]  It says right here.
[00:59:10.067 --> 00:59:12.488]  Adding ionized iodine to the salt.
[00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:14.309]  Boosted IQ, 10 to 20 points.
[00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:15.470]  Increased fertility.
[00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:18.952]  They put it in the water the kids are given at school in China.
[00:59:19.232 --> 00:59:20.073]  Why do I say that?
[00:59:20.193 --> 00:59:33.200]  Because in the 20s, we had major reproductive problems, major deformities, major retardation, major IQ reduction, not on the coastal areas where people got fresh fish that had some iodine in it, but in the Midwest.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:39.123]  You fund us, and you get atomic iodine with the other two types of iodine, so it's fully absorbable.
[00:59:39.243 --> 00:59:41.404]  That's why we have Survival Shield X3.
[00:59:41.484 --> 00:59:44.225]  I could keep selling X2 till the cows come home, and it's there.
[00:59:44.345 --> 00:59:45.686]  But this, this is the best.
[00:59:45.866 --> 00:59:46.326]  X3.
[00:59:46.506 --> 00:59:49.088]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or AAA.
[00:59:49.108 --> 00:59:49.208]  253-3139.
[00:59:49.288 --> 00:59:57.332]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:25.007]  I'm no stranger to the rain I'm a friend of thunder Friend is it any wonder lightning strikes me?
[01:00:28.269 --> 01:00:36.893]  I fought with the devil Got down on his level But I never gave in So he gave up on me
[01:00:39.622 --> 01:00:44.844]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[01:00:45.084 --> 01:00:53.347]  I can spot bad weather, and I'm good at finding shelter in a downpour.
[01:00:53.507 --> 01:01:04.111]  I've been sacrificed by brothers, crucified by lovers, but through it all, I've bested the pain.
[01:01:06.858 --> 01:01:16.562]  I'm no stranger to the rain But when I get that foggy feeling What am I feeling now?
[01:01:16.722 --> 01:01:31.329]  If I don't keep my head, I may drown But it's hard to keep believing I'll even come out even While the rain beats a hole in the ground
[01:01:33.664 --> 01:01:52.110]  And tonight it's me comin' down I'm no stranger to the rain But there'll always be tomorrow And I'll beg, steal, or borrow a little sunshine
[01:01:55.482 --> 01:01:57.763]  I'll put this cloud behind me.
[01:01:58.123 --> 01:02:00.864]  That's how the man designed me.
[01:02:01.064 --> 01:02:05.986]  To ride the wind and dance in the world again.
[01:02:06.886 --> 01:02:10.687]  I'm no stranger to rain.
[01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:12.768]  Oh no.
[01:02:15.129 --> 01:02:18.130]  I'm no stranger to pain.
[01:02:53.178 --> 01:03:05.285]  I don't believe in warning people.
[01:03:06.266 --> 01:03:09.488]  I believe caring about people builds a better civilization.
[01:03:09.548 --> 01:03:14.271]  So just like when Trump won, people stood there at the inauguration and went,
[01:03:16.297 --> 01:03:18.398]  When we go to these events, it's like they're toddlers.
[01:03:18.899 --> 01:03:21.240]  And by the way, I'm not defending minorities.
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:27.964]  Just a virtue signal.
[01:03:28.044 --> 01:03:32.327]  Most of the leadership of this weird mental illness are weird white kids of weird hippie parents.
[01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:56.177]  And they're just creating this totally race-based thing, where they say you're this horrible thing, so they're gonna yell and scream at you.
[01:03:56.357 --> 01:03:57.278]  The left is crazy.
[01:03:57.378 --> 01:03:58.538]  I was at Whole Foods yesterday.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.440]  My wife wanted me to go shop at Mother.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.541]  I don't tell her where to shop.
[01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:04.441]  She shops all over.
[01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:10.224]  She tries not to buy from Amazon or, you know, from other globalist groups that base us on Whole Foods.
[01:04:10.244 --> 01:04:11.885]  But she wanted some particular food there.
[01:04:13.066 --> 01:04:13.826]  And so we go there.
[01:04:13.986 --> 01:04:14.947]  It's right by our house, too.
[01:04:16.502 --> 01:04:25.486]  And like twice, dudes would walk over while I'm pushing the card and swing her face in like an inch and say like, you're a danger to America.
[01:04:26.726 --> 01:04:27.447]  I'm going left.
[01:04:28.767 --> 01:04:30.788]  One guy said, you're a danger to America.
[01:04:30.948 --> 01:04:31.809]  I'm going left.
[01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:34.730]  And then stomped away with his wife or his girlfriend.
[01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:37.951]  I'm like, okay, whatever that means.
[01:04:38.752 --> 01:04:41.753]  And then another guy, while I'm literally buying
[01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:47.032]  My daughter, a stuffed animal, because up at the front they had some stuffed animals.
[01:04:47.773 --> 01:04:50.594]  He walks over and he goes, hope you're proud of what you've done.
[01:04:51.495 --> 01:04:52.235]  Hope you're proud.
[01:04:53.336 --> 01:04:54.336]  We're ashamed of you.
[01:04:55.417 --> 01:04:55.837]  Like that.
[01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:57.618]  I'm like, okay, well you're a mental patient.
[01:04:58.739 --> 01:05:00.580]  But they didn't dump coffee on my head.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.340]  They didn't scream at me.
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:02.161]  They wouldn't take it.
[01:05:03.513 --> 01:05:07.917]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:05:08.998 --> 01:05:17.425]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[01:05:18.666 --> 01:05:26.673]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[01:05:27.654 --> 01:05:34.717]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[01:05:35.477 --> 01:05:37.838]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:05:38.578 --> 01:05:39.439]  It really is amazing.
[01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:46.222]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[01:05:46.682 --> 01:05:49.343]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:51.321]  Of InfoWars.
[01:05:52.141 --> 01:05:53.182]  So please, spread the links.
[01:05:53.442 --> 01:05:56.464]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:05:56.744 --> 01:05:59.446]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[01:06:00.047 --> 01:06:01.128]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:06:01.368 --> 01:06:02.489]  God bless you all, and thank you.
[01:06:08.693 --> 01:06:12.696]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:15.258 --> 01:06:19.181]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:26.767 --> 01:06:35.335]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:39.018 --> 01:06:51.169]  Well, we're blasting out on hundreds of radio stations and hundreds of TV stations and at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but not on Facebook, Twitter, all those other platforms that we officially try to put stuff out.
[01:06:51.189 --> 01:06:51.690]  We're blocked.
[01:06:52.495 --> 01:06:54.976]  And since then, they're going after Franklin Graham.
[01:06:55.016 --> 01:06:56.496]  They're kicking Gavin McInnes off.
[01:06:56.936 --> 01:07:06.359]  They're kicking thousands of prominent people off ahead of attempts to remove not just President Trump, but all other nationalist leaders around the world.
[01:07:06.399 --> 01:07:12.261]  Because globally, wherever you have free, open elections, wherever you have a free press, the globalists are losing.
[01:07:14.782 --> 01:07:16.622]  So, they're moving with censorship.
[01:07:16.682 --> 01:07:19.483]  They're moving with bullying, economic warfare, as you've seen.
[01:07:19.863 --> 01:07:21.344]  They're trying to plunge the stock market.
[01:07:24.008 --> 01:07:24.528]  It's crazy.
[01:07:25.189 --> 01:07:32.492]  The world is in a new type of economic war with big megacorporations waging war against the nation-states and the individuals.
[01:07:32.532 --> 01:07:40.496]  And most of the time, the big corporations are unified in their war against the nation-states and individuals for vertical integration.
[01:07:41.815 --> 01:07:49.236]  Anti-prosperity, anti-true progressivism, not the liberal progressivism like cancer, but true renaissance.
[01:07:49.737 --> 01:07:53.057]  That conflicts with the globalist goal of domination.
[01:07:53.657 --> 01:07:55.298]  But the globalists aren't monolithic.
[01:07:55.338 --> 01:07:56.458]  They compete with each other.
[01:07:58.038 --> 01:08:05.060]  And Trump is now bringing competition back in with the chi-coms and the EU and others, and it is upsetting them really, really big time.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.100]  We'll talk about that more
[01:08:07.148 --> 01:08:11.470]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, because our next guest has traveled all over the world.
[01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:17.973]  Now, I don't like getting him on the show because he's a four-time world champion kickboxer.
[01:08:18.653 --> 01:08:20.554]  I mean, I don't even really follow sports, but I know who he is.
[01:08:21.634 --> 01:08:28.177]  I'm getting him on because I was just telling the producers last week, I said, you know, we have all these great guests on once, we get busy and we forget.
[01:08:28.197 --> 01:08:30.218]  I said, we have a great guest on.
[01:08:30.318 --> 01:08:36.902]  I want to print out an image of their picture, their name, and hang it on the wall in the office.
[01:08:37.785 --> 01:08:38.406]  And down the hall.
[01:08:38.606 --> 01:08:40.327]  Because we have so many great guests that are great.
[01:08:40.347 --> 01:08:41.047]  So now they've done it.
[01:08:41.368 --> 01:08:42.308]  And his picture's up there.
[01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:45.931]  And then right on time, Paul Watson texted me a few days ago.
[01:08:45.951 --> 01:08:47.372]  He goes, hey, this guy's good.
[01:08:47.412 --> 01:08:48.092]  Why is he not on?
[01:08:48.112 --> 01:08:49.073]  I'm like, you're absolutely right.
[01:08:49.513 --> 01:08:50.694]  I had this guy on one time.
[01:08:50.714 --> 01:08:53.016]  I was blown away by how smart he is.
[01:08:53.496 --> 01:08:54.617]  And then said, let's get him on all the time.
[01:08:54.677 --> 01:08:55.578]  And we all just forget.
[01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.779]  And a year goes by like 10 seconds.
[01:08:57.299 --> 01:08:59.823]  So Andrew Tate is joining us.
[01:09:00.504 --> 01:09:03.628]  Interesting that he's a big champion, bare-knuckles boxer, all that.
[01:09:03.648 --> 01:09:05.211]  I'm not going to start a fight with him.
[01:09:05.731 --> 01:09:06.953]  But what I really like is his brain.
[01:09:07.594 --> 01:09:13.082]  Andrew is an American-British kickboxer from Chicago, Illinois, who competes in the cruiserweight and heavyweight divisions.
[01:09:14.127 --> 01:09:19.028]  He's three-time ISKA kickboxing world champion and Infusion Live champion.
[01:09:19.068 --> 01:09:30.171]  He is the son of the late chess master Emery Tate and also commentator for Real Extreme Fighting, the largest MMA promotion in Romania, where it's just bigger than the NFL.
[01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:41.134]  In 2016, Tate competed on the 17th season of the British version of the Dutch reality show Big Brother, YouTube Tate Speech, Twitter Tate Speech, and Instagram.
[01:09:41.974 --> 01:09:47.680]  Cobra Tate at Cobra Tate and Tate S-H-I-N-K-A-I dot net.
[01:09:48.041 --> 01:10:00.534]  So he joins us for the hour and you know I said what do you want to come on about because he's a smart guy he said well whatever you want to cover but first off we should get into the attack on quote masculinity toxic masculinity the attack on the family
[01:10:01.735 --> 01:10:14.745]  And all the other, the Islamification, you know, that's happening everywhere and what that's about and why the feminists would embrace that, I see, is the only form of toxic masculinity that's basically religious-run or state-run.
[01:10:15.406 --> 01:10:16.146]  It's just a fact.
[01:10:16.206 --> 01:10:18.068]  It's a group that will not assimilate.
[01:10:18.108 --> 01:10:19.128]  It will make us assimilate.
[01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:19.789]  It's like the Borg.
[01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.950]  You will assimilate.
[01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.770]  Resistance is futile.
[01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:24.212]  So, Andrew, great to have you on here in 2019.
[01:10:26.118 --> 01:10:26.538]  Absolutely.
[01:10:26.578 --> 01:10:27.739]  It's been a long time, sir.
[01:10:27.979 --> 01:10:28.700]  It's been a long time.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:29.380]  It's good to be here.
[01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:30.701]  That's a cool place you're in.
[01:10:30.741 --> 01:10:32.222]  That looks like a major chick magnet.
[01:10:32.923 --> 01:10:42.329]  Yeah, well, you know, I'm trying to behave myself, but yeah, I'm out here in Romania at the moment, which is pretty much... The women ain't bad looking in Romania.
[01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:44.331]  They're not bad.
[01:10:44.431 --> 01:10:45.251]  No, they're not bad.
[01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:50.252]  Eastern Europe is very ideologically different from Western Europe.
[01:10:51.173 --> 01:10:54.695]  Romania is far more likened to Poland or Slovakia or Hungary.
[01:10:55.215 --> 01:10:58.777]  So I was unhappy with Western Europe and I decided to move out to the East.
[01:10:58.877 --> 01:10:59.918]  So here I am.
[01:11:03.139 --> 01:11:05.781]  What's crazy is to find Western culture, you've got to go to the East now.
[01:11:06.894 --> 01:11:08.136]  Well, this is the most crazy thing.
[01:11:08.176 --> 01:11:14.825]  The craziest thing about Eastern Europe, the reason there's such a big cultural divide, is they tried socialism less than 20 years ago.
[01:11:15.245 --> 01:11:18.510]  Socialism's been tried, and within living memory has failed.
[01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:21.514]  And everyone knows how much better their life is under capitalism.
[01:11:22.094 --> 01:11:24.636]  As well as that, they're extremely nationalistic.
[01:11:25.096 --> 01:11:28.218]  In Romania, for example, 99% of people are Romanian.
[01:11:28.619 --> 01:11:32.521]  They're not open to the idea of having their culture diluted by people from anywhere else.
[01:11:33.061 --> 01:11:35.063]  They want a strong border around their country.
[01:11:35.443 --> 01:11:36.604]  They don't agree to Schengen.
[01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:40.887]  You can drive from England, through France, through Belgium, into Germany.
[01:11:41.167 --> 01:11:43.589]  As soon as you get to Romania, there's a nice big border check.
[01:11:43.609 --> 01:11:46.010]  They're not letting anyone in without checking who they are.
[01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:48.112]  They don't accept migrants and refugees.
[01:11:48.512 --> 01:11:51.674]  So they're completely different from the West.
[01:11:52.154 --> 01:11:57.376]  And it's very interesting, the European Union, obviously they've joined it and they're taking a whole ton of money from Germany.
[01:11:57.796 --> 01:12:03.258]  But at the same time, they're completely resisting the important legislation in regards to preserving their country.
[01:12:03.278 --> 01:12:04.298]  So I respect them for that.
[01:12:04.658 --> 01:12:05.738]  And it's really refreshing.
[01:12:05.778 --> 01:12:10.680]  I mean, the Christmas market here in Romania last month is right next to a main road.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.882]  It has no walls, no barriers, no armed police, and there's no threat of violence and nobody dies.
[01:12:17.682 --> 01:12:19.724]  But flesh that out for folks that aren't in Europe.
[01:12:19.764 --> 01:12:35.258]  They've had to build these so-called freedom barriers all over Germany, Sweden, France, because you have any gathering, especially a Christian gathering, there will be men in trucks running people over screaming Allah Akbar and the caliphate, but none of it has anything to do with Islam.
[01:12:36.072 --> 01:12:42.678]  Well, this is the most absolutely most crazy thing, because I was discussing this with somebody and I said, look, if it's nothing to do with Islam, my question is as follows.
[01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:44.739]  I'm not saying every Muslim is a terrorist.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.901]  I'm saying that every terrorist is a Muslim.
[01:12:47.261 --> 01:12:50.224]  So there must be some degree of link there.
[01:12:50.284 --> 01:12:54.167]  The fact that the book says we should all be killed must have something to do with it.
[01:12:54.247 --> 01:12:54.968]  That's the first thing.
[01:12:55.448 --> 01:13:04.280]  The second thing is, if Trump's wall is such a bad idea, why are we building walls around our own Christmas markets to prevent ourselves from being mowed down?
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:08.345]  Terrorists have moved on from bombs and things which are hard to acquire.
[01:13:08.725 --> 01:13:11.989]  They can now kill you with a knife from a kitchen drawer or a truck.
[01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:14.032]  It's impossible to police these things.
[01:13:14.412 --> 01:13:17.155]  So now we have to build a wall around any type of gathering.
[01:13:17.515 --> 01:13:21.038]  Every single street in London needs barriers along both sides.
[01:13:21.298 --> 01:13:25.141]  You're no longer safe to walk down a pavement, and we're building more wall than ever.
[01:13:25.662 --> 01:13:28.945]  However, when Trump says build a wall, all of a sudden that's a bad idea.
[01:13:28.965 --> 01:13:34.910]  You're supposed to let them in first, then try and wall yourself off from the danger, which is absolutely insane on every level.
[01:13:36.209 --> 01:13:37.951]  Well, you're on fire like last time.
[01:13:38.031 --> 01:13:40.314]  Why the hell has it been a year since this guy was on?
[01:13:42.097 --> 01:13:46.563]  Talking about toxic masculinity, the globalists are a bunch of hyper-aggressive dominant males.
[01:13:46.883 --> 01:13:48.365]  They put women in as their front groups.
[01:13:48.966 --> 01:13:51.669]  Clearly, any time a culture gets conquered, they kill all the males.
[01:13:52.130 --> 01:14:01.479]  This attack on males, even, it's in the WikiLeaks, it's in the university documents, to build their new world order, their new utopia, they must remove the role of the male from society.
[01:14:01.559 --> 01:14:06.664]  And men need to understand this, and women need to get this, that there's no separation between men and women.
[01:14:06.904 --> 01:14:08.346]  We are the damn species!
[01:14:09.447 --> 01:14:13.831]  Absolutely, and what happens is when you destroy the males, is there's no warriors left.
[01:14:14.545 --> 01:14:15.326]  This is the reality.
[01:14:15.386 --> 01:14:16.207]  The men do the fighting.
[01:14:16.247 --> 01:14:17.008]  Men are the warriors.
[01:14:17.488 --> 01:14:28.861]  So it's only when things really hit the fan, when things get at their absolute worst and chaos ensues, you need big strong men who are going to be capable of resisting absolute conquering.
[01:14:29.182 --> 01:14:30.643]  And that's why they intend to destroy us.
[01:14:30.683 --> 01:14:31.745]  And they intend to destroy us
[01:14:32.205 --> 01:14:44.829]  Through a slow, deliberate programming of just ensuring that anything we like which is overtly masculine, anything that allows us to indulge in a masculine fashion, is seen as absolutely evil in every way.
[01:14:44.909 --> 01:14:53.992]  Anything that builds our masculine power, because that's what's rewarding, it's what women want, it's what we want, anything that's fulfilling must be removed.
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:57.782]  Absolutely, because if you're not fulfilled, what do you have left?
[01:14:57.822 --> 01:14:59.884]  The only thing you have left is mindless consumerism.
[01:15:00.325 --> 01:15:11.114]  If you're not fulfilled and you can't get a girlfriend, and you're miserable within yourself with a low testosterone level, all that's left is sitting, finding a way to try and make some money, and spending it all on Amazon.com.
[01:15:11.494 --> 01:15:18.420]  All it does is make you a little slave to the dollar so you can spend as much as possible and just earn money in a cycle of nothing.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:20.402]  And you don't care about your country.
[01:15:20.622 --> 01:15:21.503]  You're not patriotic.
[01:15:21.523 --> 01:15:22.724]  You don't care about anyone but yourself.
[01:15:22.984 --> 01:15:24.866]  You just become a selfish consumer slave.
[01:15:25.086 --> 01:15:26.007]  There's nothing left to you.
[01:15:26.387 --> 01:15:27.288]  That's exactly what they want.
[01:15:27.308 --> 01:15:28.969]  They don't want big strong men who freethink.
[01:15:29.369 --> 01:15:31.371]  We're not good for the system because we can't be controlled.
[01:15:31.671 --> 01:15:33.393]  And we have the ability to resist a system.
[01:15:33.473 --> 01:15:34.093]  Well, let's take it.
[01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:43.235]  I mean, look, the DMTLSD addicts and the San Francisco cult that run this country now, they are all chicken-neck drug addicts in their own homosexual cult.
[01:15:43.655 --> 01:15:52.617]  And I'm not against them because they're gay, but the fact is they see men like us who actually, you know, are operating on the regular programming as an enemy to them.
[01:15:53.037 --> 01:15:57.378]  They think we make them weak by our very existence, and so they want to eradicate us.
[01:15:57.738 --> 01:15:58.518]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:58.538 --> 01:15:59.039]  Stay with us.
[01:15:59.059 --> 01:15:59.959]  There's a lot more to it.
[01:16:00.039 --> 01:16:00.599]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:03.306 --> 01:16:06.928]  Listeners and viewers know that every time we go to break, I pass the hat.
[01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:13.132]  I ask for your support, I ask for your prayers, I ask for your financial support buying products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:13.732 --> 01:16:15.293]  Because simply put, we're neck and neck.
[01:16:16.173 --> 01:16:21.857]  If you don't support us, Soros and Hillary and the globalist scumbags will be successful taking us down.
[01:16:22.817 --> 01:16:32.200]  If you do support us, we will, like a promontory with a lighthouse on it, in the thick of a hurricane or a typhoon, survive.
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:33.480]  It's that simple.
[01:16:34.161 --> 01:16:35.081]  So, it's epic.
[01:16:35.161 --> 01:16:35.781]  It's amazing.
[01:16:36.021 --> 01:16:37.522]  I can't believe we've lasted this long.
[01:16:38.082 --> 01:16:40.523]  In many ways, we've gotten stronger and some we've gotten weaker.
[01:16:42.123 --> 01:16:47.205]  This is the stuff of legends, and I just want listeners to continue to understand something, because it's the key.
[01:16:47.805 --> 01:16:50.126]  You are not just part of the info war.
[01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:51.346]  You're the core.
[01:16:51.386 --> 01:16:51.926]  You're the heart.
[01:16:52.047 --> 01:16:52.667]  You're everything.
[01:16:52.687 --> 01:17:06.612]  And it's that realization, understanding that, that will then push you to not just support us, but to support yourself by letters to the editor, calling into C-SPAN, starting your own local radio show, starting your own blog, starting your own...
[01:17:09.427 --> 01:17:17.733]  Whatever it is, just take action today and realize that we're going to win only if you take action.
[01:17:17.813 --> 01:17:19.294]  And again, I'm not here bitching at you.
[01:17:19.354 --> 01:17:19.974]  I love you.
[01:17:21.075 --> 01:17:21.876]  I appreciate you.
[01:17:21.896 --> 01:17:23.937]  You're like a life raft in the middle of an ocean.
[01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:25.699]  I feel like you are me.
[01:17:25.879 --> 01:17:27.400]  I mean, I'm just so humbled.
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:33.724]  I just want everybody to realize that of all the spectrums of knowledge and spectrums of information, almost all of it's disinfo.
[01:17:34.185 --> 01:17:35.125]  What we're covering is
[01:17:36.306 --> 01:17:38.887]  The blueprint of what the globalists are doing and how to stop it.
[01:17:39.267 --> 01:17:41.247]  And that's why it's so incredibly precious.
[01:17:41.667 --> 01:17:51.970]  So again, whatever you do and however you can help yourself and Infowars and our country and the world and our children, stand up against these control freaks, sociopaths, psychopaths and pedophiles.
[01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.610]  Do it.
[01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:54.850]  Because without you, we're going to lose this thing.
[01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:57.651]  And if you just keep taking action, we're not just going to win.
[01:17:57.691 --> 01:17:59.632]  We're going to build an incredible world together.
[01:17:59.852 --> 01:18:01.152]  So God bless you all and thank you.
[01:18:05.588 --> 01:18:17.491]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't have THC in it, and it's totally legal in all 50 states.
[01:18:18.491 --> 01:18:20.232]  This is where everybody's going.
[01:18:21.272 --> 01:18:23.693]  This is what your body actually needs.
[01:18:24.473 --> 01:18:35.615]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him, now legal and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[01:18:36.315 --> 01:18:42.977]  Now obviously there's been a giant marijuana legalization craze that Soros has funded the last 10 years.
[01:18:43.617 --> 01:18:44.797]  I've not been involved in that.
[01:18:46.161 --> 01:18:46.941]  It's a huge bubble.
[01:18:47.261 --> 01:18:48.482]  This is not marijuana.
[01:18:48.562 --> 01:18:50.082]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[01:18:50.302 --> 01:18:59.985]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes, but not the bad attributes that turn people into potheads in their basements picking and eating their boogers.
[01:19:00.945 --> 01:19:03.706]  This is the good CBD.
[01:19:04.426 --> 01:19:06.467]  From the organic hemp oil.
[01:19:06.907 --> 01:19:23.895]  And there are so many great products that you simply need to go to infowarsstore.com and link over to washingtonsreserve.com or simply go to washingtonsreserve.com yourself to look at all the products, to read about the history and to see the facts for yourself.
[01:19:24.255 --> 01:19:24.595]  It's a 360 win.
[01:19:26.659 --> 01:19:34.561]  There are different CBD rich hemp oil extractions for many, many, many different uses.
[01:19:35.081 --> 01:19:40.042]  You owe it to yourself to go look at this for yourself and to also understand it helps fund the Hemp Award.
[01:19:40.462 --> 01:19:42.043]  People wonder why I haven't gotten into CBD oil.
[01:19:42.523 --> 01:19:47.664]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it can get you arrested.
[01:19:48.084 --> 01:19:48.985]  This is not that.
[01:19:49.365 --> 01:19:50.465]  Legal in all 50 states.
[01:19:50.825 --> 01:19:53.006]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.
[01:19:53.366 --> 01:19:54.546]  It's totally legal.
[01:19:55.419 --> 01:20:01.927]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we can ship to all 50 states right now from the great website, washingtonsreserve.com.
[01:20:06.493 --> 01:20:09.117]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:35.379 --> 01:20:38.641]  By the way, it's not debated that they have huge op-eds.
[01:20:38.721 --> 01:20:43.624]  I covered one last week that was in the Washington Post about, we have to end masculinity.
[01:20:44.144 --> 01:20:45.525]  Men are bad, they're going to cause war.
[01:20:46.721 --> 01:20:49.564]  But, oh, the Chi-Coms, though, if you teach that over there, they execute you.
[01:20:50.505 --> 01:20:51.365]  But it's in the West.
[01:20:51.465 --> 01:20:53.267]  We must do this to demoralize everyone.
[01:20:53.728 --> 01:20:54.748]  Well, now, this just broke.
[01:20:54.788 --> 01:20:56.510]  It's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:59.052]  It's on the left-hand side of DrudgeReport.com.
[01:20:59.173 --> 01:20:59.973]  ABC News.
[01:21:00.334 --> 01:21:04.838]  Marine Corps integrates male and female platoons during boot camp for the first time.
[01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:11.384]  In almost any restaurant I go to now in Austin, you go walk in the bathroom, and there's women in there.
[01:21:12.882 --> 01:21:15.366]  And you know, I guess I'm a crude guy.
[01:21:15.386 --> 01:21:16.487]  I'm like, OK, screw it.
[01:21:16.527 --> 01:21:19.932]  And I go over and start, you know, right in front of these women.
[01:21:19.972 --> 01:21:21.294]  But then their kids are in there.
[01:21:21.514 --> 01:21:26.221]  And I tell you, it happened to me in Omaha and in Austin the last two weeks.
[01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:27.983]  And I walked out and just.
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:30.040]  Pissed in the parking lot, I'll be honest.
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:30.821]  No, I did it at home.
[01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:31.501]  I'm not gonna lie.
[01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:35.042]  The point is, is that I'm not going in the bathroom with little girls, man.
[01:21:35.522 --> 01:21:37.822]  But remember what Cuomo said, though, two years ago.
[01:21:37.863 --> 01:21:45.705]  He said, we're gonna let adult transgendered men, who think they're females, be in showers with your middle school daughters, or you're bigoted.
[01:21:46.205 --> 01:21:50.206]  And if your daughter sees a man's genitals as an offended, she's a bigot!
[01:21:52.401 --> 01:21:57.545]  So see, pedophilia is mainlined now where, well, he identifies as a woman.
[01:21:57.605 --> 01:21:59.306]  So this is their main attack.
[01:21:59.366 --> 01:22:09.715]  And I'm glad that Andrew Tate, a four-time world champion kickboxer, one of the main hosts of the top MMAs in the world, not afraid to come on this show.
[01:22:09.735 --> 01:22:10.715]  He wanted to get into this.
[01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:17.380]  First and foremost, and I want to be clear, a lot of guys get intimidated by, you know, somebody that's a world champion kickboxer.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.161]  They think, oh, well, that's a Superman.
[01:22:19.721 --> 01:22:23.344]  Or they get intimidated, you know, by somebody else because they've got a big radio show.
[01:22:24.044 --> 01:22:24.384]  To me...
[01:22:25.783 --> 01:22:31.506]  Male prowess means being a leader and doing what's right and working hard, standing up for your family.
[01:22:31.866 --> 01:22:34.467]  You could be a little skinny guy, you could be a big giant guy.
[01:22:34.507 --> 01:22:42.671]  It's about what's in your heart and your mind and not being a follower and standing up and being willing to fight, whether it's economic, political, physical.
[01:22:43.151 --> 01:22:46.533]  It's whatever you got to do, when you know it's the right thing to do, you execute.
[01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:50.695]  What is your definition of masculinity and good masculinity?
[01:22:51.516 --> 01:22:53.037]  I think you nailed it absolutely there.
[01:22:53.117 --> 01:23:02.103]  You nailed it on the fact that in the human condition, when society collapses, when everything falls apart and there's a hurricane, you need men.
[01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:14.971]  What's insane to me is they say, if you look at the reasons they say masculinity is toxic, I would love for them to be saying this when big strong men are risking their lives going into a burning building to save people.
[01:23:15.431 --> 01:23:30.070]  All the things they say about how we are more likely to take risks because of our testosterone, the fact that we value strength over empathy, all these things they say are toxic, yet at the absolute reality of the human condition, when shit really hits the fan, I apologize for my language.
[01:23:30.763 --> 01:23:31.864]  That's what you're going to need.
[01:23:32.124 --> 01:23:33.264]  You're going to need a big, strong man.
[01:23:33.304 --> 01:23:36.906]  And you're going to need a man who's going to be afraid, but is going to do it anyway.
[01:23:37.386 --> 01:23:38.987]  And this is the reality of being a man.
[01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:44.149]  It's about, I'm afraid to do such a thing, but I'm going to do it because I'm a man and it's my role to do so.
[01:23:44.529 --> 01:23:48.811]  When you try to remove masculinity, all you're doing is saying, well, you can just act out your feelings.
[01:23:49.151 --> 01:23:53.034]  If someone breaks into your house and you're afraid to do anything about it, don't worry.
[01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:55.035]  Just let them come and kill everyone in the house.
[01:23:55.395 --> 01:23:56.997]  Just sit upstairs and cry about it.
[01:23:57.297 --> 01:23:59.298]  And maybe you can go to a little safe space later.
[01:23:59.638 --> 01:24:01.200]  As a man, you don't believe in such things.
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:04.302]  You believe in the reality of the world, in an action and reaction.
[01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:07.124]  And sometimes when you're afraid, you have to do the right thing anyway.
[01:24:07.424 --> 01:24:08.925]  And this is the reality of the male condition.
[01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:10.266]  And let's expand on that.
[01:24:11.545 --> 01:24:22.533]  They're building, they admit, a world free of humans, where we're obsolete, where the robots are there, where everything's crap, where not just men are obsolete, but women, the whole species.
[01:24:23.093 --> 01:24:31.959]  And this is the whole push by the technocracy, because they're threatened by the ethos of manhood, of womanhood, and this ancient journey we have together.
[01:24:32.219 --> 01:24:33.060]  They're so scared of it.
[01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:34.838]  Absolutely.
[01:24:34.938 --> 01:24:37.199]  There's two things they fear most in the world.
[01:24:37.319 --> 01:24:40.660]  One of them is, like you said, the sacred relationship between men and women.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.521]  This is why they try and attack it from every single angle.
[01:24:44.841 --> 01:24:46.141]  I have nothing against gay people.
[01:24:46.261 --> 01:24:50.582]  I just don't see why being gay is promoted and seen as better than being a heterosexual.
[01:24:50.602 --> 01:24:52.363]  Oh yeah, it's like some new form of royalty.
[01:24:53.063 --> 01:24:53.643]  Absolutely.
[01:24:53.743 --> 01:25:01.245]  Like, why does Ellen get a bravery medal for having sex with a girl and a Navy SEAL has to get shot at?
[01:25:02.146 --> 01:25:03.006]  To get the same medal.
[01:25:04.206 --> 01:25:05.287]  It's insane to me.
[01:25:05.307 --> 01:25:07.347]  On what level are these the same events?
[01:25:07.407 --> 01:25:10.528]  How are these the same levels of bravery and courageousness?
[01:25:10.608 --> 01:25:12.348]  Obama gave Ellen a bravery award.
[01:25:12.688 --> 01:25:14.568]  And I was sitting there thinking, what has she done that's brave?
[01:25:15.528 --> 01:25:17.449]  I can name you right now, Alex.
[01:25:18.269 --> 01:25:20.449]  Everyone in my phone's had sex with a girl at some point.
[01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:21.809]  Where's our bravery medals?
[01:25:21.849 --> 01:25:23.950]  I don't understand how you can compare it to a Navy SEAL.
[01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:30.651]  So they're promoting it as it's above heterosexuality, which is insane because only heterosexuality produces something.
[01:25:31.131 --> 01:25:34.834]  You're only going to produce a child out of love with heterosexuality.
[01:25:36.115 --> 01:25:37.776]  Homosexuality doesn't lead anywhere.
[01:25:38.077 --> 01:25:39.598]  It's just a hedonistic spiral.
[01:25:39.678 --> 01:25:40.739]  And let's expand on that.
[01:25:41.099 --> 01:25:43.121]  And that's a fact.
[01:25:43.181 --> 01:25:50.046]  Highest rates of suicide, it's not that we're like, oh, two dudes, we can't, you know, it's so cool or so avant-garde we can't handle it.
[01:25:50.386 --> 01:25:57.832]  It's that highest levels of suicide, highest levels of being alone, and then they blame everyone outside of that culture for the fact that they're so unhappy.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.281]  Absolutely.
[01:25:59.881 --> 01:26:00.562]  It's criminal.
[01:26:00.802 --> 01:26:03.604]  And they want to come along and say, oh no, I'm happy because I'm persecuted.
[01:26:03.964 --> 01:26:07.067]  On what level are you genuinely persecuted for being gay in the West?
[01:26:07.107 --> 01:26:08.008]  You can be on TV.
[01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:09.048]  You can be famous.
[01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:10.249]  You can be open about it.
[01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:17.836]  Maybe you'll meet the odd psycho now and then, but I guarantee people like you and me run into more idiots than an openly gay person ever would.
[01:26:18.196 --> 01:26:20.778]  So there's nothing to do with a culture being against it.
[01:26:21.098 --> 01:26:21.859]  It's insane.
[01:26:21.999 --> 01:26:23.040]  On every level, it's insane.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:30.062]  And I don't understand why they're trying to promote it as a lifestyle choice which is superior to a heterosexual family.
[01:26:30.342 --> 01:26:31.742]  It's because they want to destroy the family.
[01:26:32.102 --> 01:26:35.143]  And the second thing that they're afraid of is patriotism.
[01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:39.104]  Because when you're patriotic, you care about something other than yourself.
[01:26:39.585 --> 01:26:40.985]  You care about where you're from.
[01:26:41.245 --> 01:26:42.785]  You care about other people like you.
[01:26:43.126 --> 01:26:48.007]  You care about the people... And when other people like that get together, it's powerful.
[01:26:48.971 --> 01:26:49.531]  Absolutely.
[01:26:49.831 --> 01:26:53.192]  So what they want to do is destroy patriotism and say, you shouldn't be patriotic.
[01:26:53.452 --> 01:26:54.173]  We're all the same.
[01:26:54.213 --> 01:26:55.433]  Everyone on the planet's the same.
[01:26:55.833 --> 01:26:58.114]  We're all going to be in one place and everyone's the same.
[01:26:58.174 --> 01:27:08.037]  And let's be clear though, they're getting rid of our identity because it's us who have our own country, our own ideas that join together that gives us real culture, a real tribe, a real group that transcends race or color.
[01:27:08.377 --> 01:27:10.238]  It is the nation that actually unifies us.
[01:27:11.072 --> 01:27:14.094]  Well, absolutely, and this is how they attack culture, you see.
[01:27:14.414 --> 01:27:16.876]  They attack culture by attempting to promote culture.
[01:27:17.236 --> 01:27:20.778]  They say, if we let in everyone from everywhere, there'll be more culture.
[01:27:21.098 --> 01:27:24.620]  But that is a lie, because culture can only be detected through nuance.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.601]  You can only detect culture through separation.
[01:27:26.962 --> 01:27:32.005]  You can tell the difference between the American culture and the Mexican culture because they're different and they're separate.
[01:27:32.325 --> 01:27:34.106]  If you let in everyone from everywhere,
[01:27:34.586 --> 01:27:40.531]  Like mixing around all your food on the plate into one big goo, you don't taste any of the individual flavors.
[01:27:40.851 --> 01:27:45.215]  You're left with a goo in the middle, nobody knows what's what, and you can't taste the cultures.
[01:27:45.475 --> 01:27:51.079]  So they're trying to destroy culture by just putting so much in the pot, you can't even detect who's what anymore.
[01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:51.519]  Exactly.
[01:27:51.559 --> 01:28:01.607]  It's like taking a hundred different beers, wines, and alcohols and putting them together and turning it into this bubbling green pish and telling us this is culture.
[01:28:01.667 --> 01:28:01.928]  No.
[01:28:02.288 --> 01:28:03.589]  What it is, is a nightmare.
[01:28:04.463 --> 01:28:04.924]  Absolutely.
[01:28:04.944 --> 01:28:06.806]  And they're like, oh, so we have all the cultures now.
[01:28:06.826 --> 01:28:07.647]  You can taste them all.
[01:28:07.667 --> 01:28:08.849]  And you say, I can taste nothing.
[01:28:09.169 --> 01:28:10.751]  I cannot taste one individual wine.
[01:28:10.771 --> 01:28:12.113]  I cannot taste one individual beer.
[01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:14.195]  We're left here with just this absolute mess.
[01:28:14.435 --> 01:28:20.623]  And this is how they attempt to attack patriotism on every level, because what they want you to be is selfish.
[01:28:21.024 --> 01:28:22.926]  If you're selfish, you will accept globalism.
[01:28:23.266 --> 01:28:29.469]  The reason we reject it so much is because we care about other people like us, we care about our lineage, we care about our families.
[01:28:29.769 --> 01:28:33.211]  But if they destroy patriotism, you don't care about the country you're in, the people you're with.
[01:28:33.231 --> 01:28:33.751]  You just said it, brother.
[01:28:33.771 --> 01:28:39.674]  We respect our ancestors and the strives they made to get us here, just as we will be ancestors one day.
[01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:45.537]  We respect people's independence and their right to be their own culture or not, instead of being forced to do this.
[01:28:45.557 --> 01:28:48.179]  So I'm going to ask when we come back to him, how do we challenge that?
[01:28:49.039 --> 01:28:50.040]  How do we fight the globalists?
[01:28:50.060 --> 01:28:51.040]  How do we get victory?
[01:28:51.341 --> 01:28:58.706]  Then we'll look at Trump and what's happening with the whole globalist operation and so much more with Andrew Tate, who's even more on fire than last time.
[01:28:58.726 --> 01:29:01.187]  I want this guy on all the time, anytime he wants to come on.
[01:29:19.299 --> 01:29:19.520]  Boom.
[01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:20.761]  Banned by Twitter.
[01:29:21.081 --> 01:29:22.083]  Banned by the App Store.
[01:29:22.403 --> 01:29:23.985]  Oh, but you still have a website.
[01:29:24.025 --> 01:29:25.867]  You still have InfoWars Store.
[01:29:25.907 --> 01:29:27.048]  You still have a shopfront.
[01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:27.989]  And then what do we see?
[01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:29.111]  Washington Post.
[01:29:29.631 --> 01:29:30.052]  Oh my God.
[01:29:30.092 --> 01:29:32.735]  Traffic to Alex Jones' InfoWars Store has increased by 50%.
[01:29:34.116 --> 01:29:37.218]  Maybe now we should look at that all the way down the line.
[01:29:37.238 --> 01:29:40.080]  They literally want to sabotage people's right to commerce.
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:45.804]  They will not stop, which is why we need your support right now by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:46.104 --> 01:29:53.089]  And again, we're not funded by giant fat checks from George Soros like Media Matters is to fund these deplatforming campaigns.
[01:29:53.429 --> 01:29:56.851]  We're not funded by Gulf state dictatorships like CNN is.
[01:29:57.092 --> 01:30:00.594]  We're only funded by you, by getting the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:30:09.534 --> 01:30:22.025]  I don't know where these markets are going to go, but if the globalists have their way, they're going to go straight down, along with your job, and along with your pay increase, and along with everything you hold dear, because these globalists want to economically capture you, and bankrupt you, and control you.
[01:30:23.567 --> 01:30:32.194]  But if you use the free energy of word of mouth, the most powerful thing in the universe, creativity, if you tell folks about InfoWars.com,
[01:30:33.968 --> 01:30:38.669]  Or NewsWars.com, or that local radio station that picks us up, or that local TV station that picks us up.
[01:30:38.769 --> 01:30:56.613]  If you spread the word about InfoWars.com, Ford's last show, if you go to InfoWarsStore.com and look at the amazing products on every front that make your life better, that make your children's life better, that make your family's life better, then you're stepping out of their control and using your economic and cultural power to smash them.
[01:30:56.893 --> 01:31:21.038]  So I would encourage everyone, Christmas ordering is over, but right through to the New Year, we have a store-wide clearance sale going, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points for your next order, a free t-shirt with every order, 50 to 75% off many of these items we lose money on, but I believe you're going to experience how great our fluoride-free, super blue toothpaste is, 4 to 5 with a little silver and iodine and other essential oils.
[01:31:21.238 --> 01:31:24.419]  I think you're going to experience how amazing it is, and you're going to want to reorder it.
[01:31:24.759 --> 01:31:35.122]  I think you're going to experience how amazing our colloidal silver bullet is, or how great RainForce Plus, our nootropic is, or how amazing our body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% cucuminoid.
[01:31:35.182 --> 01:31:36.283]  No one else even has that.
[01:31:36.363 --> 01:31:38.403]  The anti-inflammation powers are biblical.
[01:31:38.563 --> 01:31:42.764]  I believe in you, and I believe that you want freedom, and you want justice, and you want a future.
[01:31:42.905 --> 01:31:46.566]  And you understand that by financing InfoWars, you can't lose.
[01:31:46.906 --> 01:31:50.907]  Because you get products that are great for your family, you get a great deal, and you fund
[01:31:51.087 --> 01:31:59.556]  And support an organization totally and completely, absolutely turned over to the fight against the Globeless.
[01:32:00.256 --> 01:32:00.637]  Committed.
[01:32:01.077 --> 01:32:01.918]  Beyond commitment.
[01:32:02.539 --> 01:32:06.823]  Until my very individuality has been absorbed in the fight.
[01:32:07.183 --> 01:32:08.244]  And that's a damn good feeling.
[01:32:09.085 --> 01:32:12.686]  Because I'm the ultimate individualist, I'm the ultimate collectivist.
[01:32:13.186 --> 01:32:15.727]  The individual is powerful and is strong.
[01:32:16.167 --> 01:32:27.410]  When the individual chooses God and justice and joins the collective, it's a collective of individuals forming the true collective, not the false collective of the devil, Lucifer, whatever you want to call it that is slavery.
[01:32:27.690 --> 01:32:32.852]  Not a top-down collective, but a collective of common sense and the people that is transcendent.
[01:32:33.872 --> 01:32:38.734]  And it's in that true collective that humanity will reach the stars and go beyond.
[01:32:39.414 --> 01:32:49.937]  So as Christmas passes us, and 2018 goes into legend, into history, it's your chance to financially support the very tip of the spear of the fight against the globalists and get great products at the same time.
[01:32:50.457 --> 01:32:53.238]  A true 360 win, unless you don't take advantage of it.
[01:32:53.518 --> 01:32:54.019]  Please stay with us.
[01:33:05.996 --> 01:33:12.158]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.438 --> 01:33:28.942]  For the globalists, their arrogance has now dissolved into desperation.
[01:33:29.002 --> 01:33:30.482]  But now we face the counter-effect.
[01:33:41.334 --> 01:33:43.154]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:43.434 --> 01:33:46.255]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:52.876 --> 01:33:55.657]  Andrew Tate is a smart cookie and he's got a lot of courage.
[01:33:55.677 --> 01:33:57.858]  That's why he's been attacked, demonized, lied about.
[01:33:57.878 --> 01:34:01.138]  There's no reason to even get into lies they've told about him.
[01:34:01.158 --> 01:34:02.038]  I've gone and looked into it.
[01:34:02.078 --> 01:34:02.859]  It's all pure crap.
[01:34:03.219 --> 01:34:03.759]  Just like me.
[01:34:04.599 --> 01:34:09.020]  And you shouldn't take it as a bad thing when you're on the cover of newspapers and magazines
[01:34:11.246 --> 01:34:18.270]  Like the cover of the New York Times monthly magazine or weekly magazine with a cover of Texas Monthly just last few days.
[01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:20.292]  I've been on the New York Times cover.
[01:34:20.312 --> 01:34:22.553]  I've been on the Texas Monthly.
[01:34:22.593 --> 01:34:23.554]  A bunch of lies about me.
[01:34:24.414 --> 01:34:30.258]  And family calls up and says, my God, I'm at the grocery store and you're on the cover of the magazine with all this.
[01:34:30.418 --> 01:34:30.998]  How are you doing?
[01:34:31.018 --> 01:34:32.299]  And I'm like, I'm doing damn great.
[01:34:32.739 --> 01:34:34.380]  Why do you think I'm on the cover of the magazine?
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.041]  Because they're scared.
[01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:42.584]  So there's all these ideologies out there, but my ideology is common sense and history, and men and women, and a future.
[01:34:42.925 --> 01:34:44.825]  And that's Andrew Tate's ideology, I think.
[01:34:44.885 --> 01:34:50.468]  So, moving into other issues, but putting a footnote on this.
[01:34:52.768 --> 01:34:55.950]  I know this, and I've looked it up.
[01:34:55.970 --> 01:35:01.152]  It's funny how you know something, and later you actually read a Globalist even admitting it, exactly what you already knew they were doing.
[01:35:02.051 --> 01:35:07.798]  That they're afraid of men and women and everybody having rites of passage.
[01:35:08.518 --> 01:35:15.667]  Archetypal rites that they now have suddenly proven epigenetically open up instincts and things in us.
[01:35:17.054 --> 01:35:19.595]  and experiences that bring things out in us.
[01:35:20.056 --> 01:35:23.477]  They want us to have trauma and then give into it and be weak for the rest of our lives.
[01:35:23.898 --> 01:35:33.923]  Instead of having trauma, I look back on my life, and I'm not a guy that's into masochism, I don't like pain, but the worst traumas in my life because I overcame them are what made me who I am.
[01:35:33.943 --> 01:35:43.968]  And then I see the whole world's designed to keep you out of those traumas, create false traumas that are only psychological, and then basically imprison you in those traumas.
[01:35:44.048 --> 01:35:44.269]  And so,
[01:35:45.229 --> 01:35:48.211]  All the studies know that Prozac makes you commit suicide.
[01:35:49.672 --> 01:35:51.393]  So they changed the name of it a hundred times.
[01:35:51.933 --> 01:35:56.276]  But then hiking every day and lifting weights and going and helping people in the soup kitchen.
[01:35:56.516 --> 01:36:01.059]  They don't know why, but when you go help people, it's the most... Because we're designed to do it.
[01:36:01.419 --> 01:36:03.200]  Do what you're designed to do.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:05.361]  And they're battling that.
[01:36:05.401 --> 01:36:07.463]  They're trying to force us to not be who we are.
[01:36:07.483 --> 01:36:09.064]  A, do you agree with that?
[01:36:09.524 --> 01:36:14.627]  And where does Andrew Tate, four-time world champion kickboxer, think this whole thing's going and how do we stop it?
[01:36:15.666 --> 01:36:22.788]  Well, absolutely, because what happens is when you're depressed and when you're sad enough, is it's the ultimate form of selfishness.
[01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:24.528]  I've said this recently.
[01:36:24.608 --> 01:36:27.369]  I said, I don't care how bad my life goes.
[01:36:27.969 --> 01:36:29.709]  I don't care how sad I become.
[01:36:30.089 --> 01:36:36.891]  If I have a wife and I have children, I'm not going to kill myself because I have a duty to fulfill on the planet.
[01:36:37.211 --> 01:36:41.652]  So it doesn't matter how I feel because I'm a man and I have things to do.
[01:36:42.378 --> 01:36:52.585]  But what they try and do is they try and teach you that you must collapse to every single trial and tribulation in your life, and that it's okay to be weak, and that it's okay to give in, it's okay to cry.
[01:36:52.885 --> 01:36:56.747]  Because the further they push you down that rabbit hole, the more selfish you become.
[01:36:57.207 --> 01:37:10.496]  And when you're selfish and self-obsessed and self-centered, you have no time to focus on anything else, like how they're destroying us globally, how the terrible politics of a country, how they're destroying patriotism, how they're destroying our culture,
[01:37:10.816 --> 01:37:20.363]  How everything that's important, you're distracted by, because you feel sad, and you don't know, I'm sad today, and all I can think of is my, I can't see outside of myself.
[01:37:20.623 --> 01:37:25.947]  It's the ultimate selfishness, and they're trying to promote selfishness, but the same reason they're trying to destroy patriotism.
[01:37:26.187 --> 01:37:33.952]  They want every single person to be self-obsessed, consumerist, who cares about nothing other than just spending money on Amazon.com.
[01:37:34.092 --> 01:37:35.073]  That's all they're interested in.
[01:37:35.113 --> 01:37:36.474]  They don't care about anything else.
[01:37:36.894 --> 01:37:37.555]  It's insanity.
[01:37:38.235 --> 01:37:40.756]  If Andrew Tate was a preacher at a church, I'd go every Sunday.
[01:37:40.856 --> 01:37:55.403]  Andrew, it's all Veritas, because just as men, nothing special, just innate programming, why do you think we have resisted the programming when so many other men, even who play golf and act masculine, they don't engage in standing up to it, which is the real sign of a fake man?
[01:37:56.683 --> 01:37:57.843]  How do we get them to activate?
[01:37:57.863 --> 01:38:02.485]  Because I know a lot of really smart, powerful men, and they bow to these little weird nerds.
[01:38:03.145 --> 01:38:12.548]  And I'm not putting nerds down, but it does seem to be these little weird nerds that crave power, and then other men just grovel to them and try to serve them.
[01:38:12.568 --> 01:38:13.668]  I mean, do you agree with that?
[01:38:13.908 --> 01:38:14.068]  A?
[01:38:14.128 --> 01:38:14.368]  B?
[01:38:14.428 --> 01:38:15.609]  I mean, elaborate on it.
[01:38:16.029 --> 01:38:17.169]  What do we do about that?
[01:38:18.226 --> 01:38:18.967]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:38:19.027 --> 01:38:24.151]  I think that inside of every man, there is a instinct to be territorial.
[01:38:24.351 --> 01:38:26.113]  I think this is something that is a man's job.
[01:38:26.153 --> 01:38:28.194]  It's been a man's job since the dawn of time.
[01:38:28.515 --> 01:38:33.359]  Territory needed protecting, things needed protecting, and this was the male way.
[01:38:34.139 --> 01:38:38.523]  I think the problem is that a lot of these men have lost sight of what they should be protecting.
[01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:42.372]  So they still feel like they're protecting, like they feel like they're doing the right thing.
[01:38:42.392 --> 01:38:44.933]  Yeah, don't protect the Porsche and how big your job is.
[01:38:44.973 --> 01:38:48.675]  Protect your kids and your wife and your culture and your damn ideology.
[01:38:49.495 --> 01:38:50.195]  Exactly right.
[01:38:50.395 --> 01:38:54.537]  So they're sitting there thinking, ah, I'm doing the right thing as a man.
[01:38:54.577 --> 01:38:55.398]  I'm sticking up for this.
[01:38:55.418 --> 01:38:56.118]  I'm sticking up for that.
[01:38:56.378 --> 01:38:58.259]  You're sticking up for everything that's not important.
[01:38:58.999 --> 01:38:59.740]  It doesn't matter.
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.261]  What matters most is your ladies.
[01:39:01.281 --> 01:39:05.383]  And if you stick up for what's right, the dumb Porsches and jet airplanes come.
[01:39:05.763 --> 01:39:08.284]  Civilization's built on men not backing down.
[01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:10.077]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:39:10.177 --> 01:39:12.559]  Every single great civilization is built on exactly that.
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:21.447]  And the most scary thing is, if you ask someone to name a civilization from history that didn't have a warrior class, you can't.
[01:39:21.767 --> 01:39:26.411]  Because the second you get rid of a warrior class, the civilization and its history is annihilated.
[01:39:26.931 --> 01:39:28.473]  And we're now living in a modern time.
[01:39:29.053 --> 01:39:32.156]  America has more time than Western Europe, I can assure you.
[01:39:32.496 --> 01:39:34.518]  Western Europe has no warrior class left.
[01:39:34.978 --> 01:39:35.939]  They kill us at will.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.241]  They invade on boats.
[01:39:37.281 --> 01:39:38.182]  No one does anything.
[01:39:38.542 --> 01:39:41.966]  And we stand there and everyone just praising their own life.
[01:39:41.986 --> 01:39:43.208]  Something left in America.
[01:39:43.328 --> 01:39:44.769]  Eastern Europe's on fire awakening.
[01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:46.031]  Russia's awakened on fire.
[01:39:46.331 --> 01:39:47.873]  And you've got Europe collapsed in the middle.
[01:39:48.233 --> 01:39:49.515]  Why did Europe collapse?
[01:39:49.555 --> 01:39:50.876]  Because they fought the most wars?
[01:39:51.237 --> 01:39:52.038]  I mean, what happened to them?
[01:39:52.984 --> 01:39:54.325]  This is a really interesting question.
[01:39:54.365 --> 01:39:55.966]  I think it's a combination of things.
[01:39:56.286 --> 01:40:02.210]  The fact that Germany's in charge of everything and Germany has a hangover, it has a guilt hangover from the Second World War.
[01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:09.995]  What is frustrating about this is I had a great-grandfather who died to protect Europe from being under German control.
[01:40:10.395 --> 01:40:11.096]  And here we are,
[01:40:12.257 --> 01:40:15.359]  70 or 80 years later, with Germany in absolute control of Europe.
[01:40:15.399 --> 01:40:22.726]  So that was an... Think of all those brave men, and everything they went through, and it was absolutely a waste of time, and that upsets me on a personal level.
[01:40:22.806 --> 01:40:34.876]  And by the way, if you talk to Hollywood, it's come out even in leftist publications, they're pissed at the masculinity of Russia, and the fact that they're embracing the family and rejecting the leftists, where, you know, Bernie Sanders used to vacation.
[01:40:35.236 --> 01:40:38.159]  Your view on Russia and why the globalists are so upset with it?
[01:40:39.107 --> 01:40:45.268]  They're upset with it because Russia is a country that understands they have no problem in being openly nationalist.
[01:40:45.568 --> 01:40:48.409]  If you go to Moscow, they will have apartments.
[01:40:48.449 --> 01:40:50.049]  Let's say for apartments, you can rent apartments.
[01:40:50.449 --> 01:40:50.969]  I've been there.
[01:40:51.309 --> 01:40:54.090]  And some of the apartments say, we only rent to Russians.
[01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:55.290]  We only speak Russian.
[01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:56.390]  We only went to Russian.
[01:40:56.570 --> 01:40:58.250]  They're openly divisionist.
[01:40:58.450 --> 01:40:59.931]  They're openly like, this is our country.
[01:40:59.971 --> 01:41:00.691]  It's our rules.
[01:41:00.951 --> 01:41:02.031]  This is how we play by the rules.
[01:41:02.071 --> 01:41:03.671]  If you don't like it, get out.
[01:41:03.911 --> 01:41:07.292]  And they're exercising power, which they don't want people doing.
[01:41:08.243 --> 01:41:09.544]  Absolutely, they won't collapse.
[01:41:09.804 --> 01:41:11.644]  You cannot go to Russia and tell them how to be.
[01:41:12.165 --> 01:41:16.126]  This is the problem with... I don't have a problem with Muslims specifically, I have a problem with Islam.
[01:41:16.146 --> 01:41:17.727]  But they don't let us into their countries!
[01:41:18.127 --> 01:41:22.728]  This is a group that does not let you in, and we're supposed to spread our frickin' legs behind our ears.
[01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.949]  BS, man!
[01:41:25.032 --> 01:41:25.593]  Absolutely.
[01:41:25.893 --> 01:41:27.374]  The mayor of London is a Muslim.
[01:41:27.654 --> 01:41:30.656]  When will the mayor of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia be a white Christian?
[01:41:30.977 --> 01:41:31.377]  Never!
[01:41:31.757 --> 01:41:32.878]  It will never happen.
[01:41:33.198 --> 01:41:46.448]  So why is this unfair exchange in the name of liberalism happen where we think we can hand away our positions of power under some kind of deluded, they'll be nicer to us if we give our power away, with no reciprocation, no reciprocation whatsoever.
[01:41:46.749 --> 01:41:48.430]  And we think this is leading anything otherwhere.
[01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:49.991]  This is only leading to destruction.
[01:41:49.991 --> 01:41:51.971]  So how do we stop advocating our power and giving it away?
[01:41:51.991 --> 01:41:52.412]  What do people do?
[01:41:52.432 --> 01:41:54.372]  America still has some territorialism and some killer instinct.
[01:42:17.202 --> 01:42:17.622]  Absolutely.
[01:42:17.662 --> 01:42:22.485]  You can still go to an American on the street and say, we need to build the wall.
[01:42:22.745 --> 01:42:24.386]  And there'll be Americans who say, yes, we do.
[01:42:24.426 --> 01:42:25.146]  This is America.
[01:42:25.686 --> 01:42:41.494]  Whereas in London, you cannot find an English person who believes they need anything more, but then more unchecked, undocumented migrants, regardless of the fact that stabbing has gone through the roof, regardless of the terrorist attacks, regardless of everything you can name.
[01:42:41.514 --> 01:42:42.635]  Cow grooming.
[01:42:43.736 --> 01:42:50.884]  It's insane, and it doesn't matter how big a man you are, when five men come with a knife at once, by surprise, the game's over.
[01:42:53.246 --> 01:42:57.350]  Andrew Tate, four-time world champion kickboxer, is on fire.
[01:42:57.631 --> 01:43:01.415]  And I'll say, as great an exploit as his oratory, we gotta get this guy on more, man.
[01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.081]  We're ending the year.
[01:43:05.461 --> 01:43:06.422]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[01:43:06.522 --> 01:43:07.442]  It's been an insane year.
[01:43:08.743 --> 01:43:16.307]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[01:43:17.407 --> 01:43:28.353]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[01:43:29.393 --> 01:43:30.194]  And that the globalists
[01:43:31.315 --> 01:43:37.540]  Wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:42.965]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[01:43:42.985 --> 01:43:45.687]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[01:43:46.047 --> 01:43:48.009]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[01:43:49.670 --> 01:43:51.551]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[01:43:51.592 --> 01:43:53.953]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[01:43:54.814 --> 01:43:57.456]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[01:43:58.817 --> 01:44:00.198]  But our aircraft didn't have
[01:44:01.817 --> 01:44:04.118]  Radar.
[01:44:04.258 --> 01:44:15.364]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[01:44:15.584 --> 01:44:26.149]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[01:44:27.170 --> 01:44:29.151]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it,
[01:44:30.154 --> 01:44:33.197]  That they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[01:44:34.098 --> 01:44:41.346]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[01:44:42.047 --> 01:44:44.910]  Because we're showing Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[01:44:44.970 --> 01:44:46.752]  That's a separate battle.
[01:44:46.772 --> 01:44:46.992]  And so...
[01:44:54.042 --> 01:44:58.806]  They would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[01:44:59.307 --> 01:45:02.069]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:08.334]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flak, comes from that.
[01:45:09.215 --> 01:45:16.802]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flak is.
[01:45:18.735 --> 01:45:22.417]  And we find out where the biggest attack is and what pisses them off the most.
[01:45:23.197 --> 01:45:29.059]  And lo and behold, that turns out to be the most accurate information.
[01:45:29.119 --> 01:45:32.981]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[01:45:33.988 --> 01:45:42.912]  And I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[01:45:43.312 --> 01:45:56.317]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[01:45:56.517 --> 01:45:58.238]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:07.537]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out until January 1st.
[01:46:08.237 --> 01:46:13.440]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support, selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[01:46:13.961 --> 01:46:17.443]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[01:46:18.183 --> 01:46:25.527]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything, double Patriot points on your next order, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[01:46:26.007 --> 01:46:28.169]  That is extended, but only a few days left.
[01:46:28.810 --> 01:46:29.256]  I'm tailed.
[01:46:30.484 --> 01:46:31.264]  The end of this year.
[01:46:32.145 --> 01:46:43.971]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping, and a free t-shirt, and of course, so many other great items.
[01:46:44.032 --> 01:46:49.795]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item, like colloidal silver, or something like that.
[01:46:49.835 --> 01:46:55.498]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there, a true 360 win.
[01:46:55.898 --> 01:46:57.359]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:46:57.539 --> 01:46:59.160]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:47:06.832 --> 01:47:09.573]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.019 --> 01:47:22.120]  It's in the textbook!
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:24.301]  They want to end the pandemic.
[01:47:25.285 --> 01:47:29.926]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:30.206 --> 01:47:31.766]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:31.846 --> 01:47:36.507]  Well let me tell you, Andrew Tate, if he wants to be a radio talk show host, would be at the top.
[01:47:36.567 --> 01:47:42.409]  He's a smart cookie, and he's got his own videos he does all over the internet.
[01:47:43.089 --> 01:47:52.331]  So let's spend a few minutes talking about you, then I'm going to do a plug here, because I've been asking most of the questions here, but Andrew Tate, how do we find all the stuff you're doing for our listeners?
[01:47:53.717 --> 01:47:56.240]  Yes, so I have a YouTube channel.
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.483]  I'm still, it's the only place I haven't yet been de-platformed.
[01:47:59.923 --> 01:48:04.948]  I was de-platformed on Twitter, I was de-platformed on Facebook, I was de-platformed basically everywhere else.
[01:48:05.789 --> 01:48:10.554]  My YouTube still survives, which is youtube.com slash TateSpeech.
[01:48:11.403 --> 01:48:12.024]  Which is there.
[01:48:12.524 --> 01:48:16.388]  And then I have my own personal website, which is TateShinkai.net.
[01:48:16.448 --> 01:48:17.529]  You can see it there at the top.
[01:48:17.909 --> 01:48:21.513]  If I ever lose to YouTube, it'll be on TateShinkai.net that you can find me.
[01:48:21.853 --> 01:48:23.395]  I suffer exactly like you, Alex.
[01:48:23.555 --> 01:48:29.641]  People seem to think everything we say is wrong, but are afraid to debate with us, which is quite a convenient
[01:48:30.599 --> 01:48:32.120]  Uh, correlation between the two events.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:34.601]  There's nobody on this earth I'm afraid to debate with.
[01:48:35.041 --> 01:48:37.302]  I don't care how, what ideas you have.
[01:48:37.662 --> 01:48:40.543]  I'm open to discussion because I know that what I say is right.
[01:48:41.003 --> 01:48:45.005]  The reason they're trying to silence us so badly is because they cannot intelligently argue with us.
[01:48:45.505 --> 01:48:47.906]  So I suffer from exactly the same situation as you.
[01:48:47.926 --> 01:48:50.487]  I've lost my presence in many, many ways.
[01:48:50.527 --> 01:48:55.569]  I've been deeply platformed and it's very difficult for me to get my message out there and that's what's so great about your show.
[01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:59.431]  And they're sending a message to all the other people that are cucks.
[01:49:00.506 --> 01:49:03.128]  I mean, Howard Stern has said I should be taken off the air.
[01:49:03.808 --> 01:49:09.132]  Old friends, you know, have gone along with it, like Joe Rogan, because they're afraid of being deplatformed themselves.
[01:49:09.212 --> 01:49:12.194]  And it's not like I needed them to stand up for me.
[01:49:12.214 --> 01:49:15.896]  I needed them to stand up for themselves.
[01:49:16.356 --> 01:49:18.718]  So I'm not just trying, like in Hollywood, to climb higher.
[01:49:18.738 --> 01:49:27.304]  I mean, I don't want to get into inside baseball because it's off-record discussions, but I've been offered
[01:49:28.402 --> 01:49:30.083]  Obviously we have a big operation that brings a lot of money.
[01:49:30.103 --> 01:49:31.044]  Yeah.
[01:49:31.084 --> 01:49:33.026]  But we've been offered a lot of money to sell out.
[01:49:33.866 --> 01:49:34.247]  Of course.
[01:49:34.527 --> 01:49:38.630]  And I see these other people, they don't even, they're not even selling out for money.
[01:49:39.351 --> 01:49:41.352]  They're just afraid of the newspaper attacking them.
[01:49:41.673 --> 01:49:43.334]  I mean, these guys are real cucks.
[01:49:43.834 --> 01:49:45.536]  They act so damn tough all the time.
[01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.042]  Absolutely, but they're afraid to be disliked.
[01:49:48.482 --> 01:49:49.683]  They're afraid to be disliked.
[01:49:49.703 --> 01:49:51.866]  I can't say that someone may not like what I say.
[01:49:52.386 --> 01:49:55.269]  Well, the reality is as real as it gets.
[01:49:56.010 --> 01:49:58.332]  If you don't like reality, that's your problem.
[01:49:58.492 --> 01:49:59.433]  That's not my problem.
[01:49:59.734 --> 01:50:01.255]  It's my job to deliver the reality.
[01:50:01.916 --> 01:50:03.418]  I'm going to tell you the truth.
[01:50:03.838 --> 01:50:06.761]  If you can't handle the truth, you need to go look in the mirror and have your discussion.
[01:50:06.781 --> 01:50:08.503]  You don't need to come and talk to me about it.
[01:50:08.982 --> 01:50:17.369]  Because there are certain things which are so evident, so factually based, the fact that they're still being denied is literally on the level of... Yeah, like there's two genders.
[01:50:17.389 --> 01:50:18.549]  So, Andrew, let me ask you this question.
[01:50:19.971 --> 01:50:29.118]  The fact that they've got to censor everybody from you to myself to Gavin McGinnis to... They're trying to take... I mean, they've cut him down to one hour starting next week.
[01:50:30.994 --> 01:50:33.876]  People that are pro-Trump, like Michael Savage.
[01:50:34.336 --> 01:50:37.578]  The fact that they're doing all this, that's not a symbol that they're strong.
[01:50:37.958 --> 01:50:40.119]  The fact that they've had to do that shows they're weak.
[01:50:40.379 --> 01:50:45.242]  And people ought to get, wow, whatever it is they're trying to shut up, that must be the kryptonite.
[01:50:45.542 --> 01:50:46.403]  Don't people get that?
[01:50:46.423 --> 01:50:47.923]  People are like, how are you handling it?
[01:50:48.164 --> 01:50:48.764]  How are you taking it?
[01:50:49.004 --> 01:50:51.465]  How am I taking it, being in hundreds of articles a day?
[01:50:51.485 --> 01:50:54.287]  And all my enemies saying I'm the worst person ever?
[01:50:54.587 --> 01:50:55.708]  That's where I want to be!
[01:50:55.728 --> 01:50:57.769]  I mean, they don't get these fundamentals.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:03.624]  Absolutely, because if what we were saying wasn't true and had no relevance, they wouldn't want to shut us up.
[01:51:04.144 --> 01:51:05.125]  They'd just let us say it.
[01:51:05.566 --> 01:51:08.748]  It's the fact that we say it and we explain it in a way that makes people wake up.
[01:51:09.268 --> 01:51:13.432]  And that's the last thing they need is people awake and aware of the realities of life.
[01:51:13.972 --> 01:51:15.073]  Like you said, two genders.
[01:51:15.153 --> 01:51:18.375]  It cannot be disputed on any type of intelligent level.
[01:51:18.695 --> 01:51:21.857]  It's insanity to try and say anything otherwise.
[01:51:22.338 --> 01:51:24.539]  Same thing with rape statistics in Western Europe.
[01:51:24.959 --> 01:51:27.761]  The more refugees that come in, the higher the rape statistics.
[01:51:27.821 --> 01:51:28.902]  It shoots through the roof.
[01:51:29.182 --> 01:51:31.884]  I'm talking about five, six thousand percent increases.
[01:51:33.745 --> 01:51:36.407]  Where are you going to deny, how can you deny numbers?
[01:51:36.887 --> 01:51:43.350]  People are so deranged, they try and deny that a higher number is a higher value than a lower number.
[01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:48.131]  Well, it doesn't matter if it's gone up 7,000%, because how can that not matter?
[01:51:48.411 --> 01:51:50.972]  That's the level of programming some people are under.
[01:51:51.012 --> 01:51:51.973]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:51:52.233 --> 01:51:54.234]  And people like you and I will wake them up to this.
[01:51:54.874 --> 01:51:55.534]  And they're afraid.
[01:51:55.674 --> 01:51:57.255]  And they're afraid because what we say is true.
[01:51:57.595 --> 01:51:59.696]  So they deplatform us to absolutely every possibility.
[01:51:59.736 --> 01:52:00.316]  It's ridiculous.
[01:52:00.656 --> 01:52:01.656]  And let's expand on that.
[01:52:01.756 --> 01:52:03.317]  I don't want to speak for you, but I'll speak for myself.
[01:52:03.557 --> 01:52:05.578]  These people don't have historical instincts.
[01:52:06.513 --> 01:52:17.256]  They don't understand that at a gut level, I need to fight censorship, but at an intellectual level, I go, wait, if we all give into this, there's always more and more and more they're going to want until we're absolute slaves.
[01:52:17.916 --> 01:52:19.597]  I have to fundamentally do this.
[01:52:20.137 --> 01:52:21.577]  The West is all about free speech.
[01:52:22.237 --> 01:52:23.458]  So I think we've got a history.
[01:52:23.518 --> 01:52:24.718]  I think I got a chance of winning.
[01:52:25.118 --> 01:52:26.498]  But even if I don't, I got to do it.
[01:52:26.539 --> 01:52:27.679]  And then people sit back and go.
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:32.463]  Like I'm a sociopath like them and go, well, he could win or he could fail.
[01:52:32.983 --> 01:52:34.925]  Don't they get that I believe in them?
[01:52:34.985 --> 01:52:39.888]  But when they all get this sociopath attitude, we collapse into Guatemala or North Korea.
[01:52:40.288 --> 01:52:49.135]  I just don't, again, we have a shortage of men and they're all acting like candy asses trying to virtually signal to everybody and it's got to stop.
[01:52:49.595 --> 01:52:50.536]  It's got to stop.
[01:52:51.630 --> 01:52:56.932]  Absolutely it has to stop, and we live in a society now where a lot of people's sanity is open for sale.
[01:52:57.312 --> 01:52:58.053]  It's up for sale.
[01:52:58.073 --> 01:53:00.053]  If you want to work for a big company, you better shut up.
[01:53:00.494 --> 01:53:02.635]  If you want to have a Facebook and a Twitter, you better shut up.
[01:53:03.055 --> 01:53:05.016]  If you want to have this, that, whatever, you better shut up.
[01:53:05.056 --> 01:53:06.836]  Everyone's selling their sanity down the river.
[01:53:07.376 --> 01:53:14.739]  Sensible people, who know there's only two genders, are starting to say otherwise just to try and survive because they're not man enough to stand up to the oppression.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:18.461]  And if you'll put up with that crazy ass thing, you'll do anything!
[01:53:18.781 --> 01:53:20.562]  It's like saying gravity doesn't exist!
[01:53:21.982 --> 01:53:22.563]  What's next?
[01:53:22.903 --> 01:53:24.084]  And this is exactly it.
[01:53:24.144 --> 01:53:24.744]  What's next?
[01:53:24.804 --> 01:53:25.745]  How far will it go?
[01:53:26.185 --> 01:53:31.269]  It's gone so far in Western Europe now, the things I've said to you about Islam, I would be arrested for.
[01:53:31.789 --> 01:53:34.731]  I would go to jail for what I've said so far in this show.
[01:53:35.092 --> 01:53:35.972]  I can't even talk.
[01:53:36.213 --> 01:53:37.093]  You can't even tweet.
[01:53:37.253 --> 01:53:41.516]  You can't even say what you think in Western Europe because you will go to jail for it.
[01:53:41.937 --> 01:53:43.478]  This is the future for America.
[01:53:43.778 --> 01:53:49.022]  If they don't put things, if they don't resist, you're going to end up like England where the police will not catch
[01:53:50.168 --> 01:53:58.852]  Any more than 30% of the murderers who stab people to death, yet they will turn up at your door within an hour for a tweet which they deem hateful.
[01:53:59.272 --> 01:54:01.413]  And hateful is such a subjective term.
[01:54:01.693 --> 01:54:03.074]  Who decides what hateful is?
[01:54:03.174 --> 01:54:09.357]  Oh, Franklin Graham got taken off Facebook for dehumanizing, and it was an article about how great the family was.
[01:54:10.037 --> 01:54:18.444]  These godless, devil-worshipping, San Franciscan tech giants are so angry that they divorced humanity that they want to snuff it out.
[01:54:18.464 --> 01:54:20.766]  They're like blind men that don't want the light.
[01:54:21.487 --> 01:54:22.047]  It's insane.
[01:54:22.087 --> 01:54:22.307]  No!
[01:54:22.628 --> 01:54:23.348]  We exist!
[01:54:23.769 --> 01:54:24.449]  We are real!
[01:54:24.529 --> 01:54:25.610]  We love who we are!
[01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:27.552]  We love being men and women being women.
[01:54:27.572 --> 01:54:28.453]  We love our children.
[01:54:28.713 --> 01:54:30.775]  We love the natural order of things.
[01:54:31.375 --> 01:54:33.877]  And so, sorry, we're not going to bow to you.
[01:54:33.897 --> 01:54:34.498]  And I believe...
[01:54:35.848 --> 01:54:36.888]  They have reaped the whirlwind.
[01:54:37.769 --> 01:54:41.370]  I believe, from everything I've seen, that they have shut off a major chain reaction.
[01:54:44.191 --> 01:54:48.152]  Certainly in Eastern Europe, which I can speak for because I've lived in West, I've lived in the East.
[01:54:48.572 --> 01:54:51.453]  Eastern Europe is far more awakened than the Western Europe.
[01:54:51.793 --> 01:54:56.835]  Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, they are extremely aware of what's happened in Western Europe.
[01:54:56.855 --> 01:54:59.115]  Oh, we can see the web numbers out of Eastern Europe.
[01:54:59.135 --> 01:55:00.576]  They're off the chart for InfoWars.
[01:55:01.457 --> 01:55:02.098]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:55:02.359 --> 01:55:09.710]  If you go to Poland and you try one fraction of the garbage that goes down in London, it will not survive.
[01:55:09.730 --> 01:55:10.311]  Let's be clear.
[01:55:10.411 --> 01:55:13.176]  I know some folks, they will kill you.
[01:55:13.396 --> 01:55:14.398]  They won't be on the news either.
[01:55:14.438 --> 01:55:14.999]  You're just dead.
[01:55:16.125 --> 01:55:16.705]  Absolutely!
[01:55:16.965 --> 01:55:25.368]  There's no way you're gonna run around killing their children with bombs, and running over their wives with trucks, and then going to the mosque the next day, and nobody do anything about it!
[01:55:25.628 --> 01:55:27.049]  These people stand up for themselves!
[01:55:27.389 --> 01:55:29.389]  This is the difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe!
[01:55:29.669 --> 01:55:35.151]  I don't know if you're aware of this, but a couple days ago, a Romanian security guard was stabbed to death in London.
[01:55:35.451 --> 01:55:39.313]  He's a guy from Bucharest, from the city I'm currently in, and he was stabbed to death.
[01:55:39.573 --> 01:55:43.534]  He was killed by the son of an Islamic hate preacher, Amru Hamza's son.
[01:55:44.134 --> 01:55:49.279]  Abu Hamza used to walk around London preaching that anyone who's not a Muslim should die.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.361]  He was allowed to stay in the country.
[01:55:52.842 --> 01:55:55.824]  He's there under protection from the police with tax money.
[01:55:56.325 --> 01:56:01.609]  His son wanted to go into a, there was a party, some kind of sex party or something.
[01:56:02.010 --> 01:56:07.414]  I'm all advocating it, but his son tried to run into this party with his Muslim friends and kill everyone inside.
[01:56:07.795 --> 01:56:11.418]  And the Romanian security guard prevented them from going inside and got stabbed to death.
[01:56:11.838 --> 01:56:14.202]  Here in Romania, this is national news.
[01:56:14.642 --> 01:56:17.767]  In England, no one even mentions it because there's so many stabbings.
[01:56:17.847 --> 01:56:20.872]  Let's be clear, Poland hasn't had one Islamic terror attack.
[01:56:22.069 --> 01:56:22.549]  Not one.
[01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:27.032]  And when people call the Polish racist, they say, you don't care about refugees.
[01:56:27.392 --> 01:56:35.357]  The Polish accepted two million, two million Christian Ukrainian refugees during the... Let's expand on that.
[01:56:35.457 --> 01:56:39.220]  We know Romania and Hungary and Poland stopped over a hundred Islamic invasions.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:40.761]  So it's in their DNA.
[01:56:41.001 --> 01:56:42.502]  They know an invasion when they see it.
[01:56:42.922 --> 01:56:45.684]  They've been overrun by the Soviet Union previously and they're done.
[01:56:46.869 --> 01:56:51.254]  Absolutely, they fought the Ottoman Empire as long as the history books will go back.
[01:56:51.554 --> 01:56:54.257]  They were the border that resisted this for so long.
[01:56:54.558 --> 01:56:56.620]  And now they're refusing to assimilate on any level.
[01:56:57.021 --> 01:57:01.205]  And if you cannot say that Poland doesn't care about refugees, because they accept Christian white refugees,
[01:57:02.046 --> 01:57:06.848]  And by the way, we won't accept Pakistani refugees that have fatwas to kill them out of Pakistan.
[01:57:06.928 --> 01:57:10.629]  Women who are Christian are not allowed into England because Theresa May says it's hateful.
[01:57:10.829 --> 01:57:12.350]  We're going to go to break, do five more minutes with you.
[01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.910]  You're on fire.
[01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:18.172]  Andrew, I told him last time you were on a year ago, get as much as you want to come on any of the shows.
[01:57:18.212 --> 01:57:19.692]  David Knight, I know, wants to get you on.
[01:57:20.553 --> 01:57:22.613]  I know that Owen Schroer wants to get you on.
[01:57:23.073 --> 01:57:27.355]  Anytime you want to come on, brother, InfoWars is here for you and all the great work you're doing.
[01:57:27.555 --> 01:57:29.516]  I tell you, Andrew Tate is on fire.
[01:57:30.779 --> 01:57:31.760]  Didn't plug this whole hour.
[01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:32.541]  I gotta plug.
[01:57:32.681 --> 01:57:35.943]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, t-shirts, books, films.
[01:57:36.604 --> 01:57:38.746]  We've got washingtonsreserve.com.
[01:57:38.786 --> 01:57:43.870]  That's non-THC, CBD, highest quality oil out there with all the great health attributes.
[01:57:43.890 --> 01:57:45.912]  It's got washingtonsreserve.com.
[01:57:46.172 --> 01:57:47.654]  Whenever you do support us, we'll keep fighting.
[01:57:47.694 --> 01:57:48.254]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:48.294 --> 01:57:48.634]  Third hour.
[01:57:48.674 --> 01:57:49.035]  Stay with us.
[01:57:57.782 --> 01:57:59.523]  Let's go to Wild Man in Illinois.
[01:57:59.563 --> 01:58:01.865]  Thanks for holding and about to say Happy New Year.
[01:58:01.905 --> 01:58:02.185]  Go ahead.
[01:58:02.485 --> 01:58:11.972]  Alex, yeah, going into 2019, what Trump's got to do to save America, he's got to declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[01:58:12.032 --> 01:58:13.193]  That's how he saves America.
[01:58:13.253 --> 01:58:16.976]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hard-working, honest man, that's what I believe.
[01:58:17.216 --> 01:58:17.516]  I agree.
[01:58:17.616 --> 01:58:18.357]  Victory or death.
[01:58:18.417 --> 01:58:20.098]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[01:58:20.418 --> 01:58:21.899]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[01:58:22.459 --> 01:58:25.001]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[01:58:25.381 --> 01:58:27.743]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[01:58:27.763 --> 01:58:29.404]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[01:58:29.444 --> 01:58:29.984]  It's already begun.
[01:58:30.004 --> 01:58:32.066]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[01:58:32.086 --> 01:58:37.909]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[01:58:38.269 --> 01:58:38.890]  So just get ready.
[01:58:39.190 --> 01:58:39.650]  I'd say.
[01:58:39.710 --> 01:58:43.311]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[01:58:43.511 --> 01:58:45.992]  I'm a loyal supporter and thanks for great products.
[01:58:46.172 --> 01:58:47.193]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[01:58:47.273 --> 01:58:48.493]  I want to thank you.
[01:58:48.653 --> 01:58:56.016]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[01:58:56.636 --> 01:58:58.096]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[01:58:58.597 --> 01:58:59.557]  They're taking everything.
[01:59:00.277 --> 01:59:02.078]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[01:59:02.098 --> 01:59:05.200]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[01:59:05.260 --> 01:59:07.162]  That's why this is a war.
[01:59:07.702 --> 01:59:09.203]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[01:59:09.443 --> 01:59:10.744]  Which products do you like the best?
[01:59:10.884 --> 01:59:12.485]  Man, I use the bodies.
[01:59:12.565 --> 01:59:13.766]  I got so many t-shirts.
[01:59:13.786 --> 01:59:14.866]  It ain't even funny.
[01:59:14.906 --> 01:59:19.529]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, on my truck.
[01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:23.552]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[01:59:23.852 --> 01:59:24.993]  I spread the word about you.
[01:59:25.173 --> 01:59:28.255]  I wear your clothes, your hats, your shirts, you name it.
[01:59:28.875 --> 01:59:30.076]  Multitude of products.
[01:59:30.356 --> 01:59:34.059]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[01:59:34.079 --> 01:59:40.943]  Um, you know, it's, uh, people skeptical, but like, it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[01:59:40.984 --> 01:59:43.785]  I just, I guess so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[01:59:53.604 --> 01:59:57.687]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:58.208 --> 01:59:59.529]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.626 --> 02:00:31.607]  Our final segment with Andrew Tate, and to say he's on fire and fuego is an understatement.
[02:00:32.208 --> 02:00:34.348]  Absolutely on target, because it's what we're dealing with.
[02:00:34.368 --> 02:00:35.008]  It's reality.
[02:00:35.469 --> 02:00:40.670]  And that's why they want us off the air, because anybody tuning in knows at a cellular level we're telling the truth.
[02:00:41.430 --> 02:00:47.773]  So why do you literally, in waves, have hundreds of articles a day, sometimes a thousand, saying Jones is fake, he's an actor, he admits he's a liar.
[02:00:47.813 --> 02:00:48.833]  They never show where I said that.
[02:00:49.453 --> 02:00:53.354]  Because they're the liars, and they don't have their independence.
[02:00:53.574 --> 02:00:55.055]  Almost no one has their own platform.
[02:00:56.041 --> 02:01:00.522]  And that's why they hate InfoWars so much, and that's why it's so precious, and why you're so great supporting us.
[02:01:00.542 --> 02:01:03.143]  So in closing, Andrew, join us again next week.
[02:01:03.483 --> 02:01:04.263]  It's been a year.
[02:01:04.584 --> 02:01:06.584]  I wanted you on before stuff slips through.
[02:01:06.624 --> 02:01:07.224]  Please come on.
[02:01:07.865 --> 02:01:10.145]  But tell folks they can find your videos on YouTube for now.
[02:01:10.925 --> 02:01:14.347]  And, you know, obviously you host one of the biggest MMA deals in the world.
[02:01:14.367 --> 02:01:16.047]  I know it's super hot what you do.
[02:01:16.427 --> 02:01:20.648]  It's been getting demonized in the news as well because it's promoting sovereignty in Europe.
[02:01:21.809 --> 02:01:22.829]  So a lot of exciting things.
[02:01:22.849 --> 02:01:25.630]  But the four minutes we have left, what else would you like to tell folks out there?
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.923]  I'd just like to tell people that I think it's important from our standpoint that we are not quiet.
[02:01:33.003 --> 02:01:35.084]  I know sometimes it can be convenient to be quiet.
[02:01:35.444 --> 02:01:37.145]  Obviously, we have to be socially aware.
[02:01:37.225 --> 02:01:39.346]  We don't want to upset everyone we meet.
[02:01:39.846 --> 02:01:46.409]  But I make it very clear to most people I meet, I make it very clear when they say something ridiculous and completely liberal, I say that's simply not true.
[02:01:46.429 --> 02:01:51.431]  If you don't want to discuss it now, we don't have to, but it's just nice to let them know now and again that that's not true.
[02:01:51.751 --> 02:01:55.653]  The one thing the liberals and the left do have above us is that they are so petulant
[02:01:56.093 --> 02:01:56.554]  We're good to go.
[02:02:15.792 --> 02:02:16.732]  You really want the wall?
[02:02:16.952 --> 02:02:17.232]  Yes.
[02:02:17.512 --> 02:02:18.793]  Yes, I do want the wall.
[02:02:19.113 --> 02:02:22.433]  There's no such thing as a sovereign country without protecting its borders.
[02:02:22.813 --> 02:02:29.235]  If you go to any other country on Earth, they protect their borders outside of Western Europe, and that's become a mess.
[02:02:29.715 --> 02:02:31.255]  And I don't think there's anything wrong with a wall.
[02:02:31.495 --> 02:02:34.296]  Come into America, follow the rules, like everyone else.
[02:02:34.596 --> 02:02:37.296]  You don't get to choose the rules you like and the rules you don't like.
[02:02:37.656 --> 02:02:41.557]  If that was the case, I'd buy a Ferrari and speed all over the place, but I'm not allowed.
[02:02:41.897 --> 02:02:44.799]  You have to follow the rules regardless of whether you like them or not.
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:50.104]  So to just try and decide that some rules are not good enough for certain people, it's all garbage.
[02:02:50.464 --> 02:02:53.847]  And I just make it very, very clear to people how I think.
[02:02:54.227 --> 02:02:57.009]  And I remind them, you know, there's people out here who think a certain way.
[02:02:57.330 --> 02:03:01.293]  And it's not all just one big Google, Facebook, insane clown world.
[02:03:01.553 --> 02:03:07.117]  There's people out here who understand the reality of facts and look at life through a realistic lens.
[02:03:07.298 --> 02:03:08.779]  And I think that's important that everybody does that.
[02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:12.402]  And again, I saw your stuff about a year ago.
[02:03:12.482 --> 02:03:13.202]  Millions of views.
[02:03:13.242 --> 02:03:14.904]  They shadow ban you down to tens of thousands.
[02:03:14.924 --> 02:03:15.485]  It doesn't matter.
[02:03:15.885 --> 02:03:18.247]  Now you're talking to the absolute key people that matter.
[02:03:18.708 --> 02:03:19.488]  That's what we found.
[02:03:19.528 --> 02:03:21.270]  It was 99% of people never bought a product.
[02:03:22.091 --> 02:03:22.851]  Then they banned us.
[02:03:22.932 --> 02:03:24.273]  Even more people bought the product.
[02:03:24.293 --> 02:03:25.134]  We got even stronger.
[02:03:25.174 --> 02:03:28.277]  I hate to give the enemy the news that we're stronger than ever.
[02:03:28.337 --> 02:03:31.219]  We're going to get stronger thanks to our listeners and viewers understand.
[02:03:31.279 --> 02:03:33.502]  But my final message is
[02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:38.416]  Don't just think, oh, thank God that Andrew Tate's there or Alex Jones is there.
[02:03:38.436 --> 02:03:40.637]  I don't just say this to make you feel good, listeners.
[02:03:40.697 --> 02:03:41.618]  You're badass.
[02:03:42.359 --> 02:03:45.361]  And every little thing you do adds up to mountains of action.
[02:03:46.081 --> 02:03:49.344]  And so I go beyond just saying, hey, watch it.
[02:03:50.687 --> 02:03:56.611]  I chew these people out when they get in my face or I hear their crap because they're part of an oppressive, sickening, evil cult of followers.
[02:03:57.191 --> 02:03:58.332]  And the globalists, I'll give them this.
[02:03:58.352 --> 02:04:01.134]  Throughout history, big throngs of weak people were a liability.
[02:04:01.434 --> 02:04:07.138]  They figured out how to organize weak people, weaponize them, and point them at people that are actually trying to empower them.
[02:04:08.715 --> 02:04:11.097]  And so it's time to let these people know that we're not their slaves.
[02:04:11.377 --> 02:04:14.279]  And let me tell you, they think it's like a one-dimensional.
[02:04:14.299 --> 02:04:16.900]  They get in my face, I get back in their face, they can't believe I talked back.
[02:04:17.101 --> 02:04:19.082]  And they go, help me, help me, he's being mean.
[02:04:19.482 --> 02:04:22.524]  After they threaten me, they can't believe, I tell them back off.
[02:04:23.357 --> 02:04:29.299]  Isn't that insane that the world's got so twisted that liberals think they can get in a full-grown man's face and he won't say a thing back?
[02:04:29.559 --> 02:04:39.602]  Just before we leave quickly, just to show the differences between the West and the East, when I had my Twitter account and I was saying some of these things, uh, RxF who employ me to... Hold on, I gotta hear this.
[02:04:39.622 --> 02:04:40.302]  This is too good.
[02:04:40.322 --> 02:04:43.543]  And then we've got... I promise to bring folks on that disagree.
[02:04:44.224 --> 02:04:45.224]  None of... They're all cowards.
[02:04:45.284 --> 02:04:45.984]  None of them will do it.
[02:04:46.384 --> 02:04:47.865]  I'm very envious of Tucker Carlson.
[02:04:47.885 --> 02:04:48.625]  He can get these idiots on.
[02:04:49.778 --> 02:04:53.000]  But I do have Wayne Madsen, who I've known for 15 years or longer.
[02:04:53.521 --> 02:04:54.722]  He is coming on.
[02:04:54.782 --> 02:04:56.022]  I disagree with him big time.
[02:04:56.363 --> 02:04:57.263]  He's coming up too.
[02:04:57.363 --> 02:04:58.344]  Wayne Madsen.
[02:04:59.705 --> 02:05:01.046]  Trump's Hitler's coming on.
[02:05:02.607 --> 02:05:06.990]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:05:08.071 --> 02:05:16.477]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:05:17.725 --> 02:05:25.732]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:05:26.749 --> 02:05:33.791]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:05:34.551 --> 02:05:36.912]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:05:37.632 --> 02:05:38.493]  It really is amazing.
[02:05:39.113 --> 02:05:45.295]  That's why, as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:05:45.755 --> 02:05:48.356]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:05:49.679 --> 02:05:50.380]  Of InfoWars.
[02:05:51.221 --> 02:05:52.262]  So please spread the links.
[02:05:52.523 --> 02:05:55.546]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[02:05:55.827 --> 02:05:58.510]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:05:59.131 --> 02:06:00.192]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:06:00.432 --> 02:06:01.534]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:06:14.352 --> 02:06:20.327]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:46.377 --> 02:06:50.638]  Globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:06:51.718 --> 02:07:00.141]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:07:01.381 --> 02:07:09.383]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:07:10.384 --> 02:07:17.450]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:07:18.211 --> 02:07:20.573]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:07:21.294 --> 02:07:22.154]  It really is amazing.
[02:07:22.775 --> 02:07:28.960]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:07:29.421 --> 02:07:32.063]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:07:33.304 --> 02:07:34.045]  Of Infowars.
[02:07:34.886 --> 02:07:35.907]  So please spread the links.
[02:07:36.167 --> 02:07:39.190]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:07:39.491 --> 02:07:42.173]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:07:42.794 --> 02:07:43.855]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:07:44.095 --> 02:07:47.098]  God bless you all.
[02:07:52.299 --> 02:08:00.328]  I publicly asked Google employees to legally and lawfully take action, on air, the day I confronted Sundar Pichai.
[02:08:00.448 --> 02:08:02.811]  And you know, the damnedest things happened to her.
[02:08:04.605 --> 02:08:07.607]  And that's the thing is, is that we think of these things as monolithic enemies.
[02:08:07.627 --> 02:08:12.049]  A lot of the folks inside are our best friends and realize the crazy cult they're in.
[02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:14.070]  So finishing up with Andrew Tate.
[02:08:14.170 --> 02:08:15.130]  Andrew, you're awesome.
[02:08:15.170 --> 02:08:18.412]  Four-time world champion, kickboxer, and so much more.
[02:08:18.432 --> 02:08:20.833]  Big international host of it as well.
[02:08:20.953 --> 02:08:24.395]  Tate speech on YouTube, Twitter, Tate speech, Instagram, Cobra Tate.
[02:08:25.496 --> 02:08:26.136]  But I mean, look.
[02:08:26.977 --> 02:08:34.926]  I admire your physical prowess and your doggedness, but I really admire the political and pro-human stance that you sheds.
[02:08:34.946 --> 02:08:36.768]  You were getting into being banned in one final point.
[02:08:37.765 --> 02:08:39.747]  Yeah, my final point was just as follows.
[02:08:39.767 --> 02:08:43.791]  The difference between the West and Eastern Europe where I live now.
[02:08:44.151 --> 02:08:57.365]  When I was on Twitter saying the things I was saying, the MMA organization in Romania was getting about 30 emails a day from random upset liberals telling them that I was a racist and I was a sexist and I should be banned and I'm not fit for public
[02:08:57.805 --> 02:08:59.006]  And I shouldn't have my job.
[02:08:59.066 --> 02:09:02.248]  Try to make me lose my job like they do with everyone else in America.
[02:09:02.609 --> 02:09:08.613]  And when I went in to commentate one day, the owner of the organization, he had all these emails printed out and he said, what is this?
[02:09:08.673 --> 02:09:09.794]  And I said, this is the West.
[02:09:09.814 --> 02:09:11.015]  They're just, they're just children.
[02:09:11.415 --> 02:09:15.218]  And he laughed and he said, this is why they're being conquered and threw them in the bin.
[02:09:15.278 --> 02:09:16.419]  And I kept my job, of course.
[02:09:16.859 --> 02:09:21.702]  And this shows the massive ideological difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe.
[02:09:22.663 --> 02:09:24.945]  Dare I say, did you get promoted since then?
[02:09:25.802 --> 02:09:31.148]  Well yeah, we're best of friends and we've moved into some new things together and it changed absolutely nothing.
[02:09:31.168 --> 02:09:34.251]  Because I've seen that guy being demonized in the news too because he defends the family.
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:36.241]  Yeah, of course, absolutely.
[02:09:36.261 --> 02:09:38.902]  Anyone who defends the family on any level is the enemy.
[02:09:39.262 --> 02:09:40.402]  It's insanity.
[02:09:40.703 --> 02:09:46.345]  The only reason anyone who's watching this exists is because at some point a man and a woman was together.
[02:09:46.605 --> 02:09:47.306]  That's history.
[02:09:47.786 --> 02:09:56.690]  And don't corporations, because they do this on purpose to feed the fires of the pirates and the brigaders and the sleeping giant leftist Soros people,
[02:09:57.921 --> 02:10:00.943]  When you feed them and grovel like they've got power.
[02:10:01.063 --> 02:10:02.585]  Oh, I got an email or a call.
[02:10:04.186 --> 02:10:05.166]  Like, let me comply.
[02:10:05.226 --> 02:10:05.847]  I'll be safe.
[02:10:05.887 --> 02:10:08.889]  You just increase what the pirate wants next time.
[02:10:09.169 --> 02:10:12.572]  As Rudger Kipling said, these people have no instincts.
[02:10:13.533 --> 02:10:13.953]  Absolutely.
[02:10:13.993 --> 02:10:17.416]  You cannot surrender to absolute insanity because insanity knows no boundary.
[02:10:17.916 --> 02:10:19.177]  It's just they just up the game.
[02:10:19.497 --> 02:10:22.059]  They up the game like they did in England.
[02:10:22.159 --> 02:10:24.661]  Up the game, up the game, up the game to the point where you can't even talk.
[02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:27.950]  At first they say, oh, accept gay marriage, that's all we want.
[02:10:28.191 --> 02:10:31.171]  Now they want to walk around and put transgenders in our kids' classrooms.
[02:10:31.611 --> 02:10:35.772]  Every time you give them anything, they just take, give them an inch, they take a mile.
[02:10:36.112 --> 02:10:38.912]  I'm not going to apologize to anyone for anything I've ever said, because it's true.
[02:10:40.033 --> 02:10:42.613]  Well, have you seen, have you seen Desmond is amazing?
[02:10:42.653 --> 02:10:43.893]  They've had for like five years.
[02:10:44.233 --> 02:10:45.254]  The parents don't have jobs.
[02:10:45.314 --> 02:10:46.534]  The kid dances at gay clubs.
[02:10:46.554 --> 02:10:47.254]  They throw money at him.
[02:10:47.574 --> 02:10:53.275]  He talks about ketamine and roofie is all drugged out and is on TV with famous murderers that chop people up.
[02:10:53.815 --> 02:10:57.679]  I mean, the police haven't gotten involved, and this is all over the news.
[02:10:57.719 --> 02:11:00.162]  I mean, they're exercising power in our face.
[02:11:00.902 --> 02:11:04.586]  They're literally showing, we can do things you're not allowed to do.
[02:11:04.646 --> 02:11:08.310]  If you tried to do that with a girl, you'd be in jail so fast.
[02:11:08.771 --> 02:11:13.696]  But the fact there's homosexuality attached to it, and homosexuality is now above
[02:11:14.904 --> 02:11:17.345]  Above heterosexuality, it's seen as superior.
[02:11:17.545 --> 02:11:19.406]  They're literally, like you said, flexing power.
[02:11:19.626 --> 02:11:30.730]  The police won't stop us from literally promoting our child in a pedophilic manner, from promoting our child as a drug taker, using him to make money, destroying his mentality.
[02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:34.452]  I will say it right here and now, he's not going to grow up to be a happy, contented adult.
[02:11:34.812 --> 02:11:35.452]  It's impossible.
[02:11:35.452 --> 02:11:36.373]  Absolutely.
[02:11:36.413 --> 02:11:38.214]  Very great to be here and keep up the good work, Alex.
[02:11:38.254 --> 02:11:38.854]  I watch every day.
[02:11:38.894 --> 02:11:39.394]  Thank you, man.
[02:11:39.715 --> 02:11:40.875]  I appreciate you.
[02:11:40.915 --> 02:11:41.015]  Okay.
[02:11:41.035 --> 02:11:42.296]  I have told the producers of this show
[02:12:03.092 --> 02:12:05.694]  I want the type of people I see on Tucker Carlson.
[02:12:07.676 --> 02:12:08.737]  It's super entertaining.
[02:12:08.857 --> 02:12:11.179]  It's super illustrative of how crazy they love the star.
[02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:13.241]  And none of them will come on.
[02:12:14.902 --> 02:12:18.145]  And so, then I'm sitting back and I think, okay.
[02:12:18.925 --> 02:12:22.708]  Because I was following some links the other day and I saw some Wayne Madsen's website.
[02:12:23.509 --> 02:12:25.851]  And you know, Wayne has done work for us as a freelance guy.
[02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:27.592]  I've known Wayne for probably 16, 17 years.
[02:12:28.073 --> 02:12:29.194]  He's broke some big stories.
[02:12:30.595 --> 02:12:33.778]  And we covered the RNC three years ago together, two and a half years ago.
[02:12:34.618 --> 02:12:36.299]  And then it was never like he quit working with us.
[02:12:36.319 --> 02:12:42.864]  It was just kind of like, it just, it just, I mean, the reporting got, let's just say, in my view, sideways.
[02:12:43.905 --> 02:12:46.227]  And I hadn't really paid attention to much of it since then.
[02:12:46.727 --> 02:12:50.510]  But I saw it and I said, this is different because I like Wayne Madsen.
[02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:52.872]  He's a funny guy to have a glass of wine and eat a steak with.
[02:12:54.033 --> 02:12:54.833]  But my God.
[02:12:56.158 --> 02:12:59.740]  I personally think it's, if I bash Trump, I'd be the top of everything.
[02:12:59.761 --> 02:13:00.501]  I'd be promoted everywhere.
[02:13:00.861 --> 02:13:03.643]  If you don't, if you support Trump, you get banned.
[02:13:04.424 --> 02:13:07.266]  And I got some major criticisms of Trump, by the way, coming up in the next few days.
[02:13:08.086 --> 02:13:12.629]  But because it's the right thing to do, not because, and I'm not accusing Wayne of that.
[02:13:12.949 --> 02:13:19.314]  I just, going down the rat hole, him going from being a Trump supporter to Trump getting elected and being anti-Trump.
[02:13:20.234 --> 02:13:26.741]  I want to get his take on that rabbit hole, because I'm interested in it, and because he's one of the only Trump bashers who'll come on the show.
[02:13:27.301 --> 02:13:28.883]  So Wayne, it's good to have you on, buddy.
[02:13:29.944 --> 02:13:31.686]  Hi Alex, good to be back.
[02:13:32.526 --> 02:13:38.492]  I also want to preface my comment by wishing David Knight the best and a very speedy recovery.
[02:13:39.453 --> 02:13:40.554]  Wishing who a speedy recovery?
[02:13:43.277 --> 02:13:43.798]  David Knight.
[02:13:44.719 --> 02:13:48.040]  Oh yeah, he had a really bad, he had a really bad, but he's, he's getting better.
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:49.260]  Very, very excited.
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:50.321]  They got some stints in there.
[02:13:50.341 --> 02:13:52.841]  Hey, do you have an external mic you can plug in?
[02:13:55.102 --> 02:13:56.403]  External mic.
[02:13:56.763 --> 02:13:57.903]  Oh, you're better leaning forward.
[02:13:57.923 --> 02:13:58.863]  Your mic wasn't picking up.
[02:13:58.903 --> 02:14:00.704]  Let me, let me move closer to my mic.
[02:14:01.844 --> 02:14:02.784]  Well, you lost some weight.
[02:14:02.844 --> 02:14:03.605]  I've gained some weight.
[02:14:03.625 --> 02:14:04.345]  You're looking good.
[02:14:05.465 --> 02:14:07.706]  Well, under doctor's orders.
[02:14:08.466 --> 02:14:10.287]  So, I just got lazy with working out.
[02:14:10.307 --> 02:14:11.607]  I wonder if the cell phone wants to be even bigger.
[02:14:11.707 --> 02:14:14.308]  So, I started working out again last week, heavily.
[02:14:15.831 --> 02:14:17.172]  What happened with Trump?
[02:14:17.232 --> 02:14:18.513]  Let's talk about it.
[02:14:19.493 --> 02:14:29.879]  Well, you know, in the 2016 election, like most media organizations, you endorse candidates from both parties.
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:35.462]  And then in the general election, this was during the primary.
[02:14:35.802 --> 02:14:41.205]  And then during the general election, normally you'll endorse one or the other.
[02:14:41.730 --> 02:14:42.911]  Or maybe a third party.
[02:14:42.971 --> 02:14:49.934]  So I saw Trump as the non-Jeb Bush, the non, you know, it was some terrible people running.
[02:14:49.994 --> 02:14:57.078]  Lindsey Graham, Bobby Jindal, people that I have been covering and not in a very good way for years.
[02:14:58.018 --> 02:15:01.980]  And on the other side, I thought Bernie Sanders would have been the best candidate.
[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:05.522]  Now, in the general election, you know, I had my choice.
[02:15:07.036 --> 02:15:14.881]  I'll say I had already seen enough from Trump by that time that I was very, very, well, suspicious to say the least.
[02:15:15.121 --> 02:15:18.204]  And I think my suspicions have been proven correct.
[02:15:19.585 --> 02:15:19.945]  All right.
[02:15:19.965 --> 02:15:21.426]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[02:15:21.926 --> 02:15:23.147]  And you're a smart guy.
[02:15:23.167 --> 02:15:25.469]  You break a lot of big exclusive news that turns out to be accurate.
[02:15:26.570 --> 02:15:29.292]  But we'll talk about this gay obsession, too.
[02:15:30.367 --> 02:15:35.809]  Because I've known you for a long time and only lately, the last few years, everybody's gay and everything's a gay conspiracy.
[02:15:36.289 --> 02:15:37.390]  And that's when you kind of lost me.
[02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:42.572]  But I have seen Trump do some things I don't like, so I think it's fair to look at some of those areas.
[02:15:42.652 --> 02:15:43.912]  You'll have the floor to say whatever you want.
[02:15:43.952 --> 02:15:45.393]  We didn't do some pre-interview.
[02:15:45.433 --> 02:15:46.813]  I didn't tell Wayne Madsen what he could say.
[02:15:47.074 --> 02:15:47.434]  Hold on.
[02:15:47.474 --> 02:15:47.794]  Putin?
[02:15:47.814 --> 02:15:47.994]  Wait.
[02:15:49.294 --> 02:15:50.635]  Putin says get rid of Wayne Madsen.
[02:15:50.675 --> 02:15:51.235]  That's a joke.
[02:15:52.616 --> 02:15:58.358]  We'll be right back with Wayne Madsen, investigative journalist, NSA whistleblower, par excellence.
[02:16:02.290 --> 02:16:02.751]  Most of you.
[02:16:15.806 --> 02:16:23.388]  And the entire thing is an anti-family, anti-American diatribe, but it's all packaged very, very slickly.
[02:16:24.248 --> 02:16:34.591]  Here's just one example from the Sunday, December 23rd, 2018 Section E Living Area, which should be how to not live.
[02:16:35.331 --> 02:16:41.633]  It's all about how to spend time watching football with your family and how great that is, and how to set up the flicker ray on your television, right?
[02:16:42.193 --> 02:16:42.773]  I'm not kidding.
[02:16:43.753 --> 02:16:49.234]  But beneath that, there's an article, Breaking the Expectations of Boys Will Be Boys.
[02:16:50.415 --> 02:16:53.415]  It's a Washington Post editorial staff article.
[02:16:53.835 --> 02:16:56.216]  It's a very, very large syndicated column.
[02:16:57.736 --> 02:16:59.216]  And I knew what I was going to read before I read it.
[02:16:59.777 --> 02:17:05.258]  Boys aren't graduating high school or college, and boys are depressed, and boys can't get jobs.
[02:17:06.761 --> 02:17:07.942]  You know what the problem is?
[02:17:08.182 --> 02:17:09.203]  Boys are boys.
[02:17:09.243 --> 02:17:13.587]  We need to teach them how to wear pink nail polish and how to be in dance class.
[02:17:14.488 --> 02:17:16.770]  That's why we need to teach them how to be like girls.
[02:17:18.492 --> 02:17:23.897]  Because girls have been more compliant with the changes in society and that's how we fix the problem.
[02:17:24.117 --> 02:17:29.182]  He worries that the people interviewing here, that their son is playing with Nerf guns.
[02:17:30.911 --> 02:17:33.772]  And then it's just beyond sick.
[02:17:34.892 --> 02:17:38.393]  What they've done is build a world that's anti-male and anti-family.
[02:17:38.853 --> 02:17:43.154]  What they've done is target our boys with Ritalin and Prozac and all these drugs.
[02:17:43.174 --> 02:17:50.015]  What they've done is set up systems that persecute the idea of masculinity, toxic masculinity.
[02:17:50.735 --> 02:17:56.637]  It's well known that when the Romans or any other group took over a population, they would kill all the men down to age 12 or so.
[02:17:58.973 --> 02:18:02.397]  Because women are compliant with an authoritarian takeover on average.
[02:18:02.417 --> 02:18:07.161]  And they would only allow little boys to go on and survive.
[02:18:08.621 --> 02:18:09.382]  Along with little girls.
[02:18:10.302 --> 02:18:18.368]  And they would then set the women up as the intermediary between the Romans and the local slave colonies.
[02:18:18.388 --> 02:18:30.295]  You've all heard of this in the classic images of southern plantations and slavery where you'd have a large black woman who was in the house and the men were outside and she was the one that kept an eye out for master.
[02:18:31.036 --> 02:18:31.937]  She was the one that
[02:18:32.837 --> 02:18:34.919]  Made sure everybody stayed in line.
[02:18:35.259 --> 02:18:38.222]  And then you read this sick, sick evil.
[02:18:39.363 --> 02:18:42.986]  Where the system has set it up to put men into crisis and women as well.
[02:18:43.566 --> 02:18:45.328]  The whole human species is under attack.
[02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:53.454]  And the article by the end gets into gender and how we have to get rid of gender roles because that's why our boys are in trouble.
[02:18:54.275 --> 02:19:02.300]  The very same technocrats, the very same eugenicists who bragged in the 30s that they would set this up.
[02:19:02.341 --> 02:19:06.323]  People like Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley.
[02:19:06.904 --> 02:19:09.745]  The very same people that bragged about it have now brought us to that point.
[02:19:10.706 --> 02:19:19.952]  We're three or four generations into this and now those that helped create the crisis, those that helped saw off our legs, are now going to help saw off our arms.
[02:19:21.113 --> 02:19:24.116]  And help chemically sterilize our young boys.
[02:19:24.957 --> 02:19:26.078]  That's how we're going to save them.
[02:19:26.979 --> 02:19:38.491]  Just like LBJ Bragg, 45 years ago that he'd have black people voting Republican for 100 years by paying black women to not have men in the house or they wouldn't get their welfare.
[02:19:39.468 --> 02:19:40.488]  And that's how they operate.
[02:19:41.149 --> 02:19:44.710]  The article is sickening, and it's titled, Breaking the Expectation of Boys Will Be Boys.
[02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:50.172]  Parents want their sons to be who he is, not what society should say it should be.
[02:19:50.272 --> 02:19:53.494]  But they're the ones saying that you're not really a boy.
[02:19:53.814 --> 02:19:57.115]  They're the ones destroying your identity, while claiming they're protecting it.
[02:19:57.195 --> 02:20:01.537]  They're the ones telling you what to be, while claiming they're defending your right to be what you want to be.
[02:20:06.339 --> 02:20:08.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.294 --> 02:20:19.735]  All right, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:20:19.755 --> 02:20:25.717]  Vice President Mike Pence is speaking live as we speak on the border wall and some big developments.
[02:20:25.737 --> 02:20:28.698]  We'll play a few minutes of this, go right back to Wayne Madsen.
[02:20:28.738 --> 02:20:32.039]  But here is Vice President Pence with Trump in the Rose Garden at the White House.
[02:20:32.219 --> 02:20:37.401]  We are committed to achieving border security as we resolve this budget impasse.
[02:20:37.441 --> 02:20:42.122]  He made it clear that we are going to build a wall on our southern border.
[02:20:43.423 --> 02:20:46.804]  As I said, the conversations were constructive and substantive.
[02:20:47.577 --> 02:21:10.048]  And at the close of the meeting, the President directed me and Jared Kushner and Secretary Nielsen to meet with top-level staff of Democrat and Republican leadership in the House and Senate over the course of this weekend and see if we could build on the common ground that we identified in the discussions today.
[02:21:10.869 --> 02:21:16.792]  Our aim will be to find a solution, not just simply to end the government shutdown,
[02:21:17.796 --> 02:21:17.856]  The
[02:21:47.876 --> 02:21:57.443]  Not simply that we will end a budget shutdown, but that we will make, finally, meaningful progress on securing our southern border.
[02:21:57.463 --> 02:22:01.586]  I mean, we're a week and a half into the shutdown, and they're demonizing Trump.
[02:22:02.146 --> 02:22:03.047]  Wayne, let me ask you this question.
[02:22:03.067 --> 02:22:05.328]  You can get into why you don't like Trump, why you turn against him, that's fine.
[02:22:06.189 --> 02:22:07.049]  Say whatever you want.
[02:22:08.143 --> 02:22:09.004]  Come on, the U.N.
[02:22:09.064 --> 02:22:11.365]  is using giant migrant hordes to break down borders.
[02:22:11.425 --> 02:22:12.286]  You've written about that.
[02:22:12.646 --> 02:22:14.547]  They're using this to end our sovereignty.
[02:22:15.328 --> 02:22:16.889]  The entire media hates Trump.
[02:22:16.909 --> 02:22:17.990]  They're trying to remove him.
[02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:19.331]  They're doing all this.
[02:22:19.811 --> 02:22:26.535]  And then I read the articles you write, and it's like, he's the next Hitler, and he's the worst guy in the world, and he's going to destroy us.
[02:22:26.615 --> 02:22:29.457]  And I see the whole power structure against Trump.
[02:22:29.497 --> 02:22:31.138]  I mean, how do you navigate that?
[02:22:31.198 --> 02:22:37.903]  How are you not just pandering, and I'm trying to be mean here, to the Internet, you know, to the big tech giant censorship?
[02:22:38.643 --> 02:22:39.283]  Oh, and I'm not.
[02:22:39.424 --> 02:22:44.025]  And I don't agree with any attempt to control the internet.
[02:22:44.065 --> 02:22:53.249]  That's why I was against FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's decision to get rid of, it's probably a bad word, phrase, net neutrality.
[02:22:53.329 --> 02:22:55.470]  It's like universal access.
[02:22:55.510 --> 02:22:56.470]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:22:56.570 --> 02:23:03.873]  No, no, you're definitely right that Trump has acted like he's blowing his own feet off, almost like it's a conspiracy, letting all of us be censored.
[02:23:04.912 --> 02:23:05.152]  Yeah.
[02:23:06.313 --> 02:23:13.676]  I mean, I just listened to Pence's speech and I hear other people fall into this sort of rhetorical flourish.
[02:23:14.416 --> 02:23:17.278]  You know, Democrat is the adjective.
[02:23:17.518 --> 02:23:20.879]  The actual noun for the party is the Democratic Party.
[02:23:21.419 --> 02:23:26.001]  I know what they're doing because I think it goes back to people like Rush Limbaugh and others.
[02:23:26.482 --> 02:23:30.363]  They say Democrat because they emphasize the rat part.
[02:23:30.804 --> 02:23:31.184]  R-A-T.
[02:23:32.131 --> 02:23:44.938]  You know, if he wants to cut a deal with the Democratic-led House of Representatives, he should have not let that little pejorative slip into his rhetoric and his comments.
[02:23:45.359 --> 02:23:48.520]  But look, I looked at Trump.
[02:23:48.901 --> 02:23:50.642]  He said, I'm going to be a different kind of guy.
[02:23:50.662 --> 02:23:56.105]  I had my doubts when the Access Hollywood tape came out.
[02:23:56.305 --> 02:24:00.047]  And then, you know, he apologized for it.
[02:24:01.131 --> 02:24:06.974]  Um, but then there was some other issues right before on the eve of the election.
[02:24:07.675 --> 02:24:13.078]  Later, when he appoints Alex Acosta as Labor Secretary, Alex Acosta was a U.S.
[02:24:13.118 --> 02:24:16.860]  attorney for South Florida that cut Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:18.220]  No, that's true.
[02:24:18.361 --> 02:24:26.905]  That immunity deal, which not only gave immunity to Epstein for pleading a minor prostitution violation.
[02:24:26.925 --> 02:24:29.767]  Sure, and that's been pointed out, but why is the Miami Herald not pointing out
[02:24:30.347 --> 02:24:32.650]  Clinton on the airplanes with him and all of that.
[02:24:32.670 --> 02:24:34.993]  I mean, I get Trump comes in and says, who do I put in?
[02:24:35.033 --> 02:24:38.277]  They put in Republicans and he's been trying to fire a lot of them now.
[02:24:38.918 --> 02:24:39.779]  They've been working against him.
[02:24:39.799 --> 02:24:46.668]  But I don't think the fact that he brought in a bunch of Republicans that said that they would actually work for him then makes him Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:24:47.506 --> 02:24:55.369]  Yeah, but, yeah, okay, I looked at the flight manifest, and yes, Clinton took several trips because they were free.
[02:24:55.449 --> 02:24:58.070]  I mean, and politicians do that all the time.
[02:24:58.570 --> 02:25:02.272]  So, Bill Clinton's a good guy, but Trump's never on the plane.
[02:25:02.772 --> 02:25:03.492]  He's not, no.
[02:25:03.953 --> 02:25:08.554]  And look, I have critically covered presidents since Ronald Reagan.
[02:25:09.155 --> 02:25:09.595]  No, I get it.
[02:25:09.635 --> 02:25:11.015]  You're going to criticize them all.
[02:25:11.816 --> 02:25:12.496]  I'm at your right.
[02:25:14.033 --> 02:25:22.924]  I just don't get the going from being pro-Trump to totally against Trump and then like he's guilty for Epstein because somebody he puts in his government was involved at some level with it.
[02:25:23.465 --> 02:25:26.069]  When Trump keeps, he has the whole government rebelling against him.
[02:25:26.369 --> 02:25:27.691]  I mean they're not doing anything he says.
[02:25:28.592 --> 02:25:39.916]  The problem with Acosta, though, is that this non-prosecution agreement was infamous because it not only cleared Epstein, it cleared all of his associates.
[02:25:40.076 --> 02:25:45.679]  Oh no, I totally agree that he was protected, but isn't that Mueller higher up that was using him as an informant?
[02:25:47.439 --> 02:25:48.099]  Who, Epstein?
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:49.100]  Yes.
[02:25:50.051 --> 02:25:59.736]  Well, I mean, as part of his plea deal, there's a possibility that he agreed to do something for the feds, but I don't think... Well, let me ask you this, because you've got a lot of contacts.
[02:25:59.776 --> 02:26:06.799]  Why do you think Steve Bannon is hanging out, playing kissy fish at the Compound with Jeffrey Epstein in New York so much?
[02:26:09.023 --> 02:26:12.224]  Yeah, by the way, Bannon has a history.
[02:26:13.704 --> 02:26:22.166]  In one of his last divorce, his last wife, he rented her a house in North Miami, Florida.
[02:26:22.726 --> 02:26:31.769]  And neighbors later reported that there were kids coming in and out of that house all hours of the day, all hours of the night.
[02:26:32.849 --> 02:26:35.209]  There was damage done to the Jacuzzi.
[02:26:35.249 --> 02:26:37.390]  The thought is that they were cooking meth there.
[02:26:38.090 --> 02:26:47.196]  And so these children are coming in and out, and there were reports also that the house was being used to film pornographic movies.
[02:26:48.096 --> 02:26:49.217]  So what are you saying?
[02:26:51.198 --> 02:26:58.283]  Are you saying Bannon's doing this to compromise people, or are you saying Bannon is... Yeah, I think he's compromised himself.
[02:26:59.168 --> 02:27:10.514]  Um, look, we don't know the circumstances why he left the Navy as a Lieutenant JG back in the early 80s, but you know, he gets enrolled in the Harvard Business School.
[02:27:11.915 --> 02:27:13.996]  You know, I mean, what kind of deal was that?
[02:27:14.316 --> 02:27:14.656]  I mean, I
[02:27:16.357 --> 02:27:23.142]  After the Navy, I got the VA to pay for me to do an MBA, which I didn't complete at the University of North Florida.
[02:27:23.502 --> 02:27:25.103]  It's a little different than Harvard.
[02:27:26.144 --> 02:27:26.765]  A little different.
[02:27:26.785 --> 02:27:28.746]  So you're saying he's been shaped up by some people?
[02:27:29.326 --> 02:27:30.047]  I think so.
[02:27:31.108 --> 02:27:33.589]  You know, look, he went to work for Goldman Sachs.
[02:27:34.590 --> 02:27:37.992]  Then he got involved with Hollywood and all kinds of movies.
[02:27:38.092 --> 02:27:38.853]  One of his business...
[02:27:40.491 --> 02:27:52.595]  Well, I mean, look, I know Bannon's a slimeball.
[02:27:52.655 --> 02:27:53.755]  I've experienced it myself.
[02:27:53.795 --> 02:27:58.477]  He's got a campaign going against me and other people.
[02:27:59.197 --> 02:28:00.477]  So who the hell does he work for?
[02:28:00.497 --> 02:28:01.758]  Because Trump threw him out on his ass.
[02:28:02.817 --> 02:28:03.258]  I don't know.
[02:28:03.338 --> 02:28:13.347]  I mean, you know, here's a guy that, I mean, even, you know, the kindest thing you can say about him, and I think this was said by a Republican, he said the guy looks like a hobo.
[02:28:15.108 --> 02:28:16.389]  Sloppy, sloppy Steve.
[02:28:17.010 --> 02:28:18.031]  Sloppy Steve.
[02:28:18.791 --> 02:28:29.561]  But, you know, Acosta, Acosta got this deal, but left off the hook where, you know, when I started looking into the whole thing with Epstein and Trump,
[02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:36.666]  So there was a girl, well then a girl, now a woman, who said... Okay, I'm going to let you say all this.
[02:28:36.826 --> 02:28:48.836]  So we're going to come back and we're going to hear, because I got Clinton on the planes, I got it all over the place, I got Hillary representing pedophiles and famously, and her chief people at her foundation caught shipping kids out of Haiti that end up dead.
[02:28:49.316 --> 02:28:55.681]  They're in one piece of smoke or fire with Trump, but we're going to hear what you have to say about this Epstein thing with...
[02:28:56.682 --> 02:28:57.702]  Wayne Madsen on the other side.
[02:28:57.743 --> 02:28:58.403]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:58.503 --> 02:28:59.543]  Newswars.com.
[02:28:59.663 --> 02:29:02.004]  Newswars.com.
[02:29:02.324 --> 02:29:02.664]  Bacon.
[02:29:04.125 --> 02:29:05.986]  We're ending the year.
[02:29:06.366 --> 02:29:07.326]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[02:29:07.406 --> 02:29:08.347]  It's been an insane year.
[02:29:09.647 --> 02:29:17.210]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[02:29:18.311 --> 02:29:21.452]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers,
[02:29:23.146 --> 02:29:29.229]  Understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[02:29:30.289 --> 02:29:38.453]  And that the globalists wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[02:29:39.534 --> 02:29:43.876]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[02:29:43.896 --> 02:29:46.577]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[02:29:46.597 --> 02:29:48.818]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[02:29:50.569 --> 02:29:52.430]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[02:29:52.470 --> 02:29:54.892]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[02:29:55.692 --> 02:29:58.294]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[02:29:59.695 --> 02:30:05.059]  But our aircraft didn't have radar.
[02:30:05.199 --> 02:30:12.624]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe.
[02:30:13.891 --> 02:30:16.273]  And they weren't sure where to hit.
[02:30:16.493 --> 02:30:24.638]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit.
[02:30:25.318 --> 02:30:27.039]  Or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:34.104]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it, that they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:42.203]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[02:30:42.223 --> 02:30:48.225]  For as we're showing, it's Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[02:30:48.645 --> 02:30:52.206]  That's a separate battle.
[02:30:52.386 --> 02:30:59.729]  And so, they would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[02:31:00.209 --> 02:31:02.950]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[02:31:03.854 --> 02:31:09.235]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flack, comes from that.
[02:31:10.095 --> 02:31:24.879]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flack is, and we find out where the biggest attack is, and what pisses them off the most, and lo and behold,
[02:31:26.696 --> 02:31:29.960]  That turns out to be the most accurate information.
[02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:33.884]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[02:31:34.872 --> 02:31:43.799]  I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[02:31:44.219 --> 02:31:57.229]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[02:31:57.429 --> 02:31:59.171]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[02:32:00.157 --> 02:32:08.442]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out until January 1st.
[02:32:09.142 --> 02:32:14.345]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support, selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[02:32:14.865 --> 02:32:18.327]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job, too.
[02:32:19.087 --> 02:32:26.451]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything, double Patriot points on your next order, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[02:32:26.912 --> 02:32:29.073]  That is extended, but only a few days left.
[02:32:29.813 --> 02:32:32.175]  Until the end of this year.
[02:32:33.036 --> 02:32:41.182]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping and a free t-shirt.
[02:32:42.248 --> 02:32:44.870]  And of course, so many other great items.
[02:32:44.930 --> 02:32:50.694]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver or something like that.
[02:32:50.734 --> 02:32:55.017]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there.
[02:32:55.337 --> 02:32:56.398]  A true 360 win.
[02:32:56.798 --> 02:32:58.279]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:32:58.439 --> 02:33:00.140]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:33:06.405 --> 02:33:09.026]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:25.876 --> 02:33:28.037]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:33:28.458 --> 02:33:30.979]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:31.539 --> 02:33:33.961]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.481 --> 02:33:37.122]  So I see Trump trying to bring the economy back and having some success.
[02:33:37.162 --> 02:33:38.423]  They raise interest rates and spike it.
[02:33:39.044 --> 02:33:40.284]  I see Trump trying to bring factories back.
[02:33:40.304 --> 02:33:46.348]  I see Trump trying to unify America around nationalism and release a lot of suppressed cures for diseases.
[02:33:47.446 --> 02:33:48.586]  I see Trump being demonized.
[02:33:48.666 --> 02:33:56.609]  I see the heavens open up and lies and attacks and lawsuits about yours truly I've never even imagined for back in Trump.
[02:33:57.289 --> 02:34:01.810]  And now I see nationalists all over the world winning elections and kicking the globalists out and the big banks.
[02:34:01.890 --> 02:34:04.011]  I mean it's like good things are happening.
[02:34:05.011 --> 02:34:06.692]  And then Wayne Madsen he says well
[02:34:07.856 --> 02:34:20.207]  Trump's connected to Jeffrey Epstein because one of the thousands of people he's appointed in government was a federal prosecutor, and I agree with Wayne, he's right, that let Jeffrey Epstein absolutely skate like all the other rich and powerful.
[02:34:20.227 --> 02:34:23.570]  I mean, you've got the Clintons, all the rest of it.
[02:34:23.590 --> 02:34:25.452]  So, go there.
[02:34:25.752 --> 02:34:33.679]  Dump your, dump your dirt on Trump, if it's got any bona fides, and then tell me, Wayne,
[02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:38.853]  How we see the whole establishment against him, and believe me, it's not a faux attack.
[02:34:39.653 --> 02:34:41.555]  I mean, I've enjoyed it myself.
[02:34:41.855 --> 02:34:42.696]  It's definitely real.
[02:34:43.256 --> 02:34:45.157]  It's like getting hit upside the head with a two-by-four every day.
[02:34:45.498 --> 02:34:52.563]  And tell me, then, who the power structure is, and okay, if he's bad, then why is the power structure having a heart attack every five seconds about Trump?
[02:34:52.583 --> 02:34:57.686]  I mean, because you're a smart cookie, been in the Navy, worked for the NSA, wrote a lot of big stories.
[02:34:58.246 --> 02:34:59.707]  You've said a lot of stuff that turns out to be true.
[02:34:59.928 --> 02:35:01.649]  How am I missing the picture here?
[02:35:02.549 --> 02:35:07.713]  Okay, it's not that Acosta was appointed to, you know, any federal agency.
[02:35:08.013 --> 02:35:17.179]  The Labor Secretary is responsible for monitoring human trafficking, including human trafficking for sexual exploitation.
[02:35:17.579 --> 02:35:26.226]  Now the Justice Department prosecutes, but Labor, for some reason they put it in Labor, probably because of child labor laws, it's under their purview.
[02:35:26.286 --> 02:35:28.027]  So here you got a guy who cut Epstein
[02:35:28.567 --> 02:35:28.888]  We're good.
[02:35:38.118 --> 02:35:43.560]  Trump, unlike some of the others, was really a longtime friend.
[02:35:44.001 --> 02:35:47.722]  Trump even said, oh, I've known Jeff Epstein for 15 years.
[02:35:47.782 --> 02:35:48.603]  What a great guy.
[02:35:48.643 --> 02:35:51.004]  I've been over to his place in Palm Beach.
[02:35:51.984 --> 02:35:57.567]  I noticed some of the girls that hang out there are kind of on the young side, but I know he likes them young.
[02:35:58.487 --> 02:36:02.789]  Well, according to one lawsuit brought against Trump and Epstein in 2016,
[02:36:08.454 --> 02:36:18.370]  Both of them brutally sodomized a 13-year-old girl who uses a pseudonym, Katie Johnson, and a 12-year-old girl named Maria.
[02:36:20.148 --> 02:36:21.989]  All of those Jane Doe's turned out to be fake.
[02:36:22.049 --> 02:36:22.890]  That all got thrown out.
[02:36:22.910 --> 02:36:24.732]  We have Epstein caught bussing.
[02:36:24.752 --> 02:36:25.752]  We have him with Bill Clinton.
[02:36:26.053 --> 02:36:29.656]  We have the House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey on the plane.
[02:36:29.996 --> 02:36:32.058]  We have Hillary representing pedophiles.
[02:36:32.338 --> 02:36:33.419]  We have you exposing it.
[02:36:33.719 --> 02:36:37.182]  And then you're saying Trump's like, oh yeah, I've never seen a great guy at some event.
[02:36:37.542 --> 02:36:38.483]  He says that about everybody.
[02:36:38.803 --> 02:36:41.145]  That turns into, this is all real.
[02:36:41.185 --> 02:36:42.286]  Then where is that lawsuit?
[02:36:42.967 --> 02:36:48.069]  First of all, I recently attended a trial in West Palm Beach, a civil trial.
[02:36:48.089 --> 02:36:49.490]  Epstein settled.
[02:36:50.230 --> 02:36:56.032]  He brought suit against the lawyer who has been pro bono representing many of these victims.
[02:36:56.592 --> 02:37:00.414]  I discovered there's 104 Jane Does according to court filings.
[02:37:01.034 --> 02:37:05.357]  According to the attorney for these victims... Sure, all I'm telling you is I'm on air too.
[02:37:05.417 --> 02:37:06.357]  I follow this up every day.
[02:37:06.838 --> 02:37:08.419]  Epstein's been coming up for a decade.
[02:37:08.579 --> 02:37:13.502]  I never heard about Trump until the last few months of the election and then it turned out to be nothing.
[02:37:13.582 --> 02:37:14.943]  I'm not denying Epstein.
[02:37:15.003 --> 02:37:16.083]  I exposed him up front.
[02:37:16.443 --> 02:37:18.285]  I'm not denying the whole Clinton operation.
[02:37:18.925 --> 02:37:25.849]  To me, all those stories look like cover for the Clintons when we were hammering Epstein and hammering Pizzagate and hammering it.
[02:37:25.969 --> 02:37:28.531]  Suddenly, oh, Trump once was at a party.
[02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:33.603]  No, the Epstein and Trump Association was actually reported in 2002.
[02:37:34.004 --> 02:37:38.547]  Granted, we weren't looking closely at Trump or Epstein.
[02:37:38.587 --> 02:37:42.490]  In those lawsuits that Epstein just settled, there was no allusion to Trump in those.
[02:37:42.530 --> 02:37:50.116]  They were saying Epstein, that 15, 16-year-old girls would give him massages, and then he would try to push them to have sex, to groom them, to corrupt other men.
[02:37:50.937 --> 02:37:52.077]  So he settled that.
[02:37:52.298 --> 02:37:53.879]  There was not a damn word about Trump in there.
[02:37:54.574 --> 02:38:00.800]  Yeah, but Katie Johnson brought suit that named Epstein and Trump as her rapists in 1994.
[02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:08.606]  So what do you make then of other prominent lawyers, other Democrat lawyers, others that have been shanked into this?
[02:38:08.787 --> 02:38:12.790]  Well, there's certainly Alan Dershowitz has been named.
[02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:17.915]  Now he's a longtime supporter of the Democrats, but now he's one of Trump's most vocal defenders.
[02:38:20.762 --> 02:38:28.064]  In the lawsuit, Katie Johnson withdrew her suit just a few days before the election because there was supposed to be a news conference in L.A.
[02:38:28.465 --> 02:38:34.686]  and she cited the fact that there were threats against her, her family, people, docs, her grandparents.
[02:38:34.726 --> 02:38:35.687]  Okay, well let me ask you this.
[02:38:36.007 --> 02:38:41.308]  You know, I've had the press say things about me, that my children have been taken away, all these things that aren't true.
[02:38:41.328 --> 02:38:42.369]  So I've experienced the BS.
[02:38:43.249 --> 02:38:45.890]  I haven't seen any proof about Trump.
[02:38:46.310 --> 02:38:49.972]  I've seen a bunch of Democrat recycling and I don't see you writing articles about Hillary.
[02:38:50.372 --> 02:38:52.192]  I don't see you writing articles about Bill anymore.
[02:38:52.232 --> 02:38:53.313]  It's all about Trump.
[02:38:53.793 --> 02:39:01.456]  And I just, you know, Wayne, I just don't think that that's accurate with some Jane Doe's and all this other stuff with no proof, no evidence, no other claims of this.
[02:39:01.556 --> 02:39:02.676]  I know people that know Trump well.
[02:39:02.716 --> 02:39:04.237]  He likes full-grown women.
[02:39:04.537 --> 02:39:07.698]  It's just, I mean, if they had all this, they would have already used this.
[02:39:08.700 --> 02:39:14.362]  Well, there was another person cited, a 12-year-old named Maria, in the lawsuit.
[02:39:14.542 --> 02:39:16.663]  Another Jane Doe?
[02:39:16.683 --> 02:39:22.084]  Now, she's not been identified, actually, because she hasn't brought any suits.
[02:39:22.805 --> 02:39:29.667]  She was identified... Sir, do you know they've got people in the news saying, I wear Nazi tennis shoes and telepathically try to have gay sex?
[02:39:30.737 --> 02:39:34.018]  So what I'm telling you is I've experienced the BS myself.
[02:39:34.038 --> 02:39:39.621]  I don't listen to rumors either, but I go to court documents, I go to police reports.
[02:39:39.681 --> 02:39:40.421]  Yeah, Jane does.
[02:39:40.801 --> 02:39:44.743]  Wayne, I'm going to tell you right now, I think you are regurgitating, and I wanted to get you on to people to hear this.
[02:39:46.047 --> 02:39:48.809]  A total line of Democratic Party talking points.
[02:39:48.929 --> 02:39:50.250]  Where are the stories about Hillary?
[02:39:50.450 --> 02:39:51.891]  Where are the stories about the U.N.
[02:39:51.931 --> 02:39:52.671]  child trafficking?
[02:39:52.951 --> 02:39:57.894]  Where are the stories about bonafide Arab Spring and hundreds of thousands of women and children kidnapped and murdered?
[02:39:58.154 --> 02:39:59.255]  You used to report on that.
[02:39:59.315 --> 02:40:08.741]  Now it's all lawsuits that get dropped about all this trying to tie Trump to Epstein because Epstein's tied to Obama and Hillary and the Democrats.
[02:40:09.881 --> 02:40:14.586]  I gotta go where the clear and present danger lies right now.
[02:40:15.107 --> 02:40:24.057]  It lies in the White House, it lies at the Department of Labor, and if we see... So do you think Trump needs... So you agree with our new Islamic members of Congress, he should be impeached right now.
[02:40:24.157 --> 02:40:25.238]  He trumps the threat.
[02:40:26.075 --> 02:40:27.917]  Well, impeachment is a process.
[02:40:27.977 --> 02:40:29.179]  I believe in the process.
[02:40:29.799 --> 02:40:31.141]  Kind of like the Kavanaugh hearings?
[02:40:31.161 --> 02:40:33.003]  I'm asking you, who is to blame?
[02:40:33.263 --> 02:40:34.605]  Who is the bad guy?
[02:40:34.645 --> 02:40:36.106]  You said you've written a book.
[02:40:36.306 --> 02:40:36.907]  I forget the name.
[02:40:37.167 --> 02:40:37.708]  I didn't read it.
[02:40:38.609 --> 02:40:39.570]  Trump's the new Hitler?
[02:40:39.610 --> 02:40:40.111]  Or what is it?
[02:40:40.231 --> 02:40:42.934]  No, it's called Trump's Bananas Republic.
[02:40:43.904 --> 02:40:45.665]  Because it truly is bananas.
[02:40:45.885 --> 02:40:47.926]  It's bananas in Washington right now.
[02:40:48.867 --> 02:40:50.007]  Well, I did see some book.
[02:40:50.027 --> 02:40:51.668]  Did you sell a book about Trump?
[02:40:51.708 --> 02:40:53.429]  Or you wrote an article saying he's the new Hitler?
[02:40:53.970 --> 02:40:54.830]  Probably an article.
[02:40:54.890 --> 02:40:58.332]  But, you know, I wrote articles and made comments back...
[02:40:59.372 --> 02:41:03.454]  Sure, well let me ask you this then, let me ask you this.
[02:41:03.674 --> 02:41:15.399]  Why is Trump, does he even admit that child rings and sex rings have been cracked down on 10 times previous numbers, I'll put the graphs on screen, and that I want to get a passport for my 20 month old baby.
[02:41:15.559 --> 02:41:19.281]  It's like jumping through 100 hoops now, which is great, it's not so easy to do anymore.
[02:41:20.281 --> 02:41:31.006]  So, I mean, I see massive... I mean, Obama was bringing kidnapped kids through from the caravans and loading them on Democrat vehicles, the Senate report, that were going to sex dens and some were killed.
[02:41:31.126 --> 02:41:31.926]  That's confirmed.
[02:41:31.966 --> 02:41:32.827]  We have their names.
[02:41:33.387 --> 02:41:35.188]  So, Trump is stopping all that.
[02:41:35.268 --> 02:41:38.469]  How is he then this giant child molester mothership?
[02:41:39.679 --> 02:41:45.562]  Well, now you got children being separated at the border and put into camps where they die or they're molested.
[02:41:45.602 --> 02:41:48.244]  We know there's bona fide news reports about that.
[02:41:48.264 --> 02:41:52.306]  Obama is the one that started separating them under ACLU requests and put them in cages.
[02:41:52.606 --> 02:41:54.007]  Trump got rid of the cages.
[02:41:54.827 --> 02:41:56.468]  These are talking points, Wayne.
[02:41:57.169 --> 02:41:58.229]  I've seen the photos.
[02:41:58.349 --> 02:42:03.352]  I mean, you can call it a cage or you can call it a... No, no, those photos were from under Obama.
[02:42:04.099 --> 02:42:16.586]  A chain-link fence inside a warehouse, but the reason why this is serious with these two girls, Katie Johnson... Hey, we'll come back and talk about this when we come back, but I'm going to point-blank you.
[02:42:17.026 --> 02:42:18.767]  You can accuse me of working for whoever you want.
[02:42:18.807 --> 02:42:20.668]  You can't create any proof because it's not happening.
[02:42:20.708 --> 02:42:21.589]  I'm funded by our listeners.
[02:42:22.189 --> 02:42:28.632]  But I've got to ask you, the 180 you made after Trump got elected and the talking points you put out are the dyed-in-wool Democrat talking points.
[02:42:29.013 --> 02:42:33.355]  Are you taking any money from the Clinton Foundation or from MoveOn.org or any other group?
[02:42:34.096 --> 02:42:36.859]  Well, nobody's offered me any, but I wouldn't if they did.
[02:42:36.879 --> 02:42:39.021]  I believe in my independence.
[02:42:39.762 --> 02:42:48.151]  I used to work for a non-profit that was partly funded by Soros, Epic, years ago, but I left them in 2004.
[02:42:48.351 --> 02:42:50.994]  You think I'm working for somebody?
[02:42:52.609 --> 02:43:00.896]  I wouldn't think so because the one telltale sign is people who don't run advertising are getting that money from somewhere.
[02:43:01.016 --> 02:43:06.921]  So, if you run advertising... In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[02:43:07.902 --> 02:43:13.804]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[02:43:14.305 --> 02:43:23.708]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[02:43:24.208 --> 02:43:25.409]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[02:43:25.969 --> 02:43:28.270]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[02:43:28.850 --> 02:43:45.018]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes, everybody knows about it on so many fronts, and helps a lot of people.
[02:43:45.818 --> 02:43:54.102]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear, and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[02:43:54.972 --> 02:44:14.866]  But now they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[02:44:15.626 --> 02:44:17.868]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation.
[02:44:18.877 --> 02:44:22.580]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[02:44:22.620 --> 02:44:23.280]  They're patriots.
[02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:34.928]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[02:44:35.488 --> 02:44:36.329]  You drop ship it.
[02:44:36.429 --> 02:44:37.049]  You get it out.
[02:44:37.250 --> 02:44:38.130]  You have the website.
[02:44:38.751 --> 02:44:39.351]  I promote it.
[02:44:39.531 --> 02:44:40.412]  I send people there.
[02:44:40.692 --> 02:44:43.634]  And that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[02:44:44.334 --> 02:44:47.757]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[02:44:48.891 --> 02:44:58.517]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[02:44:59.278 --> 02:45:04.001]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[02:45:04.301 --> 02:45:12.407]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[02:45:13.598 --> 02:45:23.728]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[02:45:23.989 --> 02:45:25.831]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[02:45:25.871 --> 02:45:26.451]  I've researched it.
[02:45:26.471 --> 02:45:31.977]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us in the last six years.
[02:45:31.997 --> 02:45:33.378]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[02:45:34.179 --> 02:45:46.064]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[02:45:47.398 --> 02:45:55.264]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[02:45:55.944 --> 02:46:12.175]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all because they have more than 40 products.
[02:46:12.536 --> 02:46:15.298]  Now remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[02:46:15.498 --> 02:46:16.499]  They've tried to shut us down.
[02:46:17.279 --> 02:46:18.479]  They've tried to boycott us.
[02:46:18.499 --> 02:46:19.300]  They've tried to sue us.
[02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:26.302]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[02:46:26.522 --> 02:46:28.443]  We're still going to do that, then forwardslife.com.
[02:46:28.643 --> 02:46:34.285]  But we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[02:46:34.365 --> 02:46:36.186]  And this is the first big one.
[02:46:36.566 --> 02:46:37.426]  So I'm very excited.
[02:46:37.446 --> 02:46:38.227]  Be sure and go there.
[02:46:38.287 --> 02:46:44.949]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[02:46:45.169 --> 02:46:47.451]  Highest quality, the lowest prices.
[02:46:47.892 --> 02:46:53.677]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at WashingtonReserve.com, and you're helping fund the InfoWar the whole time.
[02:47:05.808 --> 02:47:08.451]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:43.304]  Roger Stone's gonna be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:47:43.344 --> 02:47:44.365]  I'm gonna coast a little bit with him.
[02:47:45.687 --> 02:47:47.289]  You know, Jeffrey Epstein's been a public figure.
[02:47:47.329 --> 02:47:48.790]  He's met tens of thousands of people.
[02:47:49.431 --> 02:47:52.996]  Here he is with theoretical physicist Lawrence M.
[02:47:55.436 --> 02:48:00.740]  Lawrence M. Krause and Steven Pinker that promote global social scores, all this other crap.
[02:48:01.081 --> 02:48:06.185]  Wherever you see these guys on, podcasts, anywhere, you know you're getting fed a lot of bull, but Doc McCam, shot please.
[02:48:06.705 --> 02:48:07.866]  There they are with Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:48:07.906 --> 02:48:13.110]  So, Jeffrey Epstein's in 24 flights we know of with the Clintons, going to this pedophile island.
[02:48:13.851 --> 02:48:17.073]  He's on there with all the rest of these people, but that's not what we've got to look at.
[02:48:17.173 --> 02:48:21.657]  It's Trump, socialite, shaking hands with people, saying he's been friends with people.
[02:48:22.847 --> 02:48:28.512]  You know, we were really worried about Epstein because we were covering it heavy and the Clintons and the WikiLeaks and all of it.
[02:48:28.592 --> 02:48:32.536]  Boy, then a couple Jane Doe's, Folsom things, that all gets deep six.
[02:48:33.717 --> 02:48:38.021]  And Wayne Madsen's here telling us it's Trump.
[02:48:38.502 --> 02:48:41.845]  You know, Wayne, I'm going to give you a few minutes here to finish up and I appreciate you coming on.
[02:48:44.733 --> 02:48:48.175]  Especially on the border wall, you got me, because that was a Democrat talking point.
[02:48:48.195 --> 02:48:50.156]  Look at the kids in cages wrapped in the tinfoil.
[02:48:50.477 --> 02:48:51.177]  That was Obama.
[02:48:51.197 --> 02:48:51.798]  That was confirmed.
[02:48:51.818 --> 02:48:52.918]  We can show some of those articles.
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:56.961]  Just answer me this, and you can say whatever you want.
[02:48:57.661 --> 02:49:01.544]  Why is the whole power structure running around like chickens with their heads cut off about Trump?
[02:49:02.404 --> 02:49:03.445]  Why are they so upset?
[02:49:03.485 --> 02:49:04.686]  Why are the CHICOM so upset?
[02:49:04.726 --> 02:49:05.606]  Why is the EU so upset?
[02:49:05.926 --> 02:49:08.708]  Why is the media out there, you know, saying, cut his head off?
[02:49:08.768 --> 02:49:11.330]  I mean, is that all just an elaborate ruse?
[02:49:12.256 --> 02:49:22.506]  Well, I think compared to other presidents, I think we've got somebody in office who's unsteady, who's insulting in the worst degree.
[02:49:22.866 --> 02:49:33.076]  But I just want to say about the other girl who was 12 years old, was abducted from her hometown and sold into the Epstein network.
[02:49:33.816 --> 02:49:37.978]  And she sat for an interview with ABC News before the election.
[02:49:38.038 --> 02:49:48.442]  But again, just like Katie Johnson and her family were threatened, ABC got threatened and the producers got threatened by somebody from the Trump Organization.
[02:49:48.822 --> 02:49:51.003]  So if all this is hearsay... Where's the proof of that?
[02:49:51.523 --> 02:49:56.084]  I mean, I'm showing Flight Manifest here with Bill Clinton and all these flights and the convictions.
[02:49:56.104 --> 02:49:56.945]  Where's proof of that?
[02:49:58.414 --> 02:50:04.059]  The proof is in two court filings, one of which was the latest one in New York City.
[02:50:04.079 --> 02:50:07.842]  Well, I mean, I've heard in court that I lost my kids and I'm an actor, but none of that's true.
[02:50:08.442 --> 02:50:10.524]  These are court filings where U.S.
[02:50:10.584 --> 02:50:19.531]  federal judge Ronnie Abrams decided there was enough merit to call Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump to a conference in her chambers.
[02:50:20.231 --> 02:50:24.093]  In the Southern District of New York, that was scheduled for December 16th.
[02:50:24.534 --> 02:50:29.036]  But in the interim, Katie Johnson, because of the threats, withdrew her lawsuit.
[02:50:30.097 --> 02:50:39.262]  Interestingly enough, December 16th was the day that the Electoral College certified Trump's... No, I remember Nancy Pelosi's daughter trying to stop Trump being seated and all that BS.
[02:50:39.682 --> 02:50:40.903]  Wayne, I gotta say it, man.
[02:50:41.323 --> 02:50:43.925]  You admitted you were funded by Soros previously.
[02:50:44.785 --> 02:50:47.106]  All I can tell you is I've never heard such talking points.
[02:50:47.647 --> 02:50:49.468]  If he's unstable, we need more unstable.
[02:50:49.508 --> 02:50:52.909]  We need somebody that stands up against countries that rip us off on trade.
[02:50:53.170 --> 02:50:55.511]  Somebody that pulls our troops out of major wars.
[02:50:55.931 --> 02:50:58.332]  Somebody that stands up to defend our country and take care of the veterans.
[02:50:58.793 --> 02:51:00.874]  Somebody that's got the lowest black unemployment ever recorded.
[02:51:00.994 --> 02:51:06.216]  I mean, I just, you know, I just don't hear anything substantive in what you've said.
[02:51:06.256 --> 02:51:08.918]  I've heard no, no, no proof of anything here.
[02:51:10.359 --> 02:51:13.263]  Well, I mean, look, I go to documentation.
[02:51:13.363 --> 02:51:14.724]  It's filed in the courts.
[02:51:15.325 --> 02:51:16.827]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:51:17.027 --> 02:51:18.369]  I've seen people stay in court.
[02:51:20.086 --> 02:51:23.028]  That I believe there's Martian slave children on Mars.
[02:51:23.188 --> 02:51:26.030]  Now, I never said that, but they tried to take my kids away using that.
[02:51:26.650 --> 02:51:29.072]  So, you're... I mean, I could go file an affidavit with the court.
[02:51:29.092 --> 02:51:37.817]  I could file a lawsuit on anybody I want and say that they took me up in a flying saucer and, you know, and anally probed me with the Easter Bunny.
[02:51:38.197 --> 02:51:39.298]  It doesn't mean it's true, right?
[02:51:39.338 --> 02:51:43.521]  You keep saying... Because I know they file these fake lawsuits on me, too, and say, oh, look, it's the court.
[02:51:43.781 --> 02:51:44.221]  It's the court.
[02:51:44.241 --> 02:51:48.784]  But the lawsuits get thrown out as fast as they're entered, because once it comes out that I didn't do that, they get thrown out.
[02:51:49.554 --> 02:51:52.777]  Well how many meet a merit threshold by a U.S.
[02:51:53.277 --> 02:51:54.278]  District Court judge?
[02:51:54.318 --> 02:51:58.762]  And that's what the case was with Katie Johnson and Maria.
[02:51:59.423 --> 02:52:05.708]  Maria, look, you know, she is a Puerto Rican girl.
[02:52:05.728 --> 02:52:07.610]  You mean she's a Jane Doe?
[02:52:08.413 --> 02:52:10.094]  This is just something somebody filed.
[02:52:10.674 --> 02:52:12.455]  She didn't she didn't file herself.
[02:52:12.495 --> 02:52:13.095]  She was named.
[02:52:13.175 --> 02:52:18.518]  I mean, you know, there's a woman in New Orleans says I was married to her 30 years and my name is Lafayette.
[02:52:18.598 --> 02:52:19.298]  We have babies.
[02:52:19.358 --> 02:52:19.918]  It ain't true.
[02:52:20.699 --> 02:52:25.161]  I went to the police station that originally investigated the kidnapping of this girl.
[02:52:25.581 --> 02:52:26.621]  I read the documents.
[02:52:27.082 --> 02:52:29.963]  It's clear she was trafficked into New York City.
[02:52:29.983 --> 02:52:30.843]  Where are those?
[02:52:30.883 --> 02:52:32.044]  The police just gave you these documents?
[02:52:33.563 --> 02:52:37.106]  Look, somebody tried to sit on it.
[02:52:37.326 --> 02:52:39.828]  They did not want to release them to us in the beginning.
[02:52:40.228 --> 02:52:44.972]  And then I find out that Donald Trump has real estate holdings in the particular city.
[02:52:45.072 --> 02:52:45.713]  Oh, my God.
[02:52:45.733 --> 02:52:51.277]  So Donald Trump is... People always say I work for Stratford because Stratford is based here in Austin.
[02:52:51.297 --> 02:52:52.518]  Stratford wouldn't give me the time of day.
[02:52:52.538 --> 02:52:53.839]  I'd have him on as a guest.
[02:52:54.679 --> 02:53:01.685]  But, I mean, those type of statements... Wayne, how much money did you take from George Soros?
[02:53:02.669 --> 02:53:03.489]  Uh, zero.
[02:53:04.209 --> 02:53:05.630]  Uh, look, he's still a bad guy.
[02:53:05.650 --> 02:53:07.690]  Wait, you said earlier you used to get money from George Soros.
[02:53:08.250 --> 02:53:10.391]  Oh, no, I left a group in 2004.
[02:53:11.291 --> 02:53:12.451]  He was one of their donors.
[02:53:12.531 --> 02:53:13.172]  It was a non-profit.
[02:53:13.232 --> 02:53:13.652]  I understand.
[02:53:13.672 --> 02:53:16.012]  You can't swing a stick in the dark and not get George Soros money.
[02:53:16.432 --> 02:53:22.794]  I'm not thinking you're a George Soros operative, but hey, if I came out and crapped all over Trump, man, I'd be the darling of YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, too.
[02:53:23.436 --> 02:53:29.738]  Yeah, Robert Mercer and Rebecca Mercer are my new targets in this investigating billionaires who have agendas.
[02:53:29.858 --> 02:53:35.860]  They were the big funders of Steve Bannon and Breitbart, and they deserve some very close scrutiny.
[02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:42.502]  Well, I am glad you said something true here, because it's on record they were the biggest funders of Breitbart and the turdling Bannon.
[02:53:44.918 --> 02:53:54.487]  Yeah, well, the Mercers I think are to me are just as reprehensible and worthy of an investigation as George Soros was.
[02:53:54.547 --> 02:53:56.790]  I think he's been defanged to some extent.
[02:53:57.150 --> 02:53:58.932]  Oh, I've been enjoying his defanging.
[02:54:00.017 --> 02:54:02.338]  Boy, I'm glad he's only got gums to bite me in the ass.
[02:54:02.378 --> 02:54:03.139]  It don't feel too good.
[02:54:03.439 --> 02:54:04.520]  Hey, Wayne Madsen.
[02:54:04.860 --> 02:54:06.201]  WayneMadsenReport.com.
[02:54:06.281 --> 02:54:11.504]  People can see what you have to write there, and I appreciate you joining us.
[02:54:11.524 --> 02:54:11.904]  Thank you.
[02:54:12.404 --> 02:54:12.724]  You bet.
[02:54:13.605 --> 02:54:14.385]  Oh, God.
[02:54:14.906 --> 02:54:15.466]  This country.
[02:54:17.607 --> 02:54:22.030]  You know, Wayne's been on the show a lot of times, and
[02:54:23.300 --> 02:54:27.746]  I guess he just suddenly reads Democratic talking points.
[02:54:28.227 --> 02:54:29.349]  Maybe they're not talking points.
[02:54:29.389 --> 02:54:31.972]  Maybe it's kind of like gambling.
[02:54:32.093 --> 02:54:34.396]  You know, you get royal flushes every 200, 300 poker games.
[02:54:37.557 --> 02:54:44.103]  Maybe he just says perfect Democrat talking points exactly as they are in those orders, accidentally.
[02:54:44.743 --> 02:54:45.364]  I think that's it.
[02:54:45.904 --> 02:54:46.845]  I don't think he's been paid.
[02:54:47.246 --> 02:54:48.427]  I don't think there's any talking points.
[02:54:48.947 --> 02:54:57.495]  I think he just dead set, hole in one, knocked it out of the park with Democratic talking points in their exact order, all by himself.
[02:55:01.298 --> 02:55:03.300]  But I'm going to start having the libtards on.
[02:55:03.460 --> 02:55:04.261]  He's not a libtard.
[02:55:05.208 --> 02:55:06.868]  He knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:55:07.448 --> 02:55:11.169]  Some may say it's mother's milk of Veritas, others can say it's poison of the witch's tit.
[02:55:12.449 --> 02:55:25.791]  All I can tell you is, my gut tells me DJT's good, but he's surrounded by traitors, and he's in over his head, and 5G's bad, the vaccine's being tainted as bad, him not declassifying all the dirt on the deep state's bad.
[02:55:26.912 --> 02:55:28.992]  He is just surrounded by traitors and cowards.
[02:55:30.372 --> 02:55:33.393]  You know, I think Pompeo's probably good, you know, I hope the leader of the House,
[02:55:34.889 --> 02:55:35.950]  Republican leaders, good.
[02:55:35.970 --> 02:55:37.712]  I don't know at this point.
[02:55:37.812 --> 02:55:38.873]  I'm not going to leave it up to Trump.
[02:55:40.555 --> 02:55:41.215]  It's up to us.
[02:55:41.336 --> 02:55:42.377]  We built this revolution.
[02:55:42.417 --> 02:55:43.318]  The audience built it.
[02:55:43.398 --> 02:55:43.918]  You built it.
[02:55:44.559 --> 02:55:45.660]  And I'm not even mad at Trump.
[02:55:46.381 --> 02:55:49.344]  I just... Oh, I didn't even get into our top story today.
[02:55:49.384 --> 02:55:50.485]  My God, am I a bad person.
[02:55:52.540 --> 02:56:00.472]  I'll do five minutes in the next hour, then a few minutes with Roger Stone about our top story about the hacking group.
[02:56:01.033 --> 02:56:04.538]  They did release the first of the five tranches
[02:56:05.911 --> 02:56:11.717]  Five pieces proving they've got internal secret documents from the government and lawsuits about stand-downs and more.
[02:56:12.058 --> 02:56:13.639]  They said, this is just proving we have it.
[02:56:14.440 --> 02:56:16.222]  Each tranche gets more devastating.
[02:56:16.262 --> 02:56:18.064]  They act for some paltry amount of money.
[02:56:18.484 --> 02:56:19.145]  That's the cover.
[02:56:19.245 --> 02:56:20.907]  This is an intelligence agency releasing this.
[02:56:21.447 --> 02:56:22.729]  Hell, this might be the Russians.
[02:56:23.129 --> 02:56:24.110]  All I can do is tell the truth.
[02:56:24.270 --> 02:56:25.692]  It's probably rogue U.S.
[02:56:25.732 --> 02:56:26.473]  intelligence groups.
[02:56:26.813 --> 02:56:27.374]  Probably Trump.
[02:56:28.763 --> 02:56:32.965]  And this is exactly what we need to see a lot of right now.
[02:56:34.006 --> 02:56:35.667]  Oh, Hillary's emails, they just got leaked.
[02:56:35.947 --> 02:56:37.548]  Who cares who got them, just release them.
[02:56:39.549 --> 02:56:40.110]  I'm all in.
[02:56:40.510 --> 02:56:41.811]  I'm not properly plugged today.
[02:56:42.951 --> 02:56:43.932]  It's not a sales gimmick.
[02:56:44.432 --> 02:56:45.933]  I've been so busy doing other things.
[02:56:45.973 --> 02:56:47.974]  I was gonna shoot a report on something this morning to something else.
[02:56:49.475 --> 02:56:54.378]  So, it's the third day I've said this, where I've been too busy to do the new special.
[02:56:55.751 --> 02:56:58.053]  Too busy to cut the new ads, too busy to do it.
[02:56:58.154 --> 02:57:05.581]  So, the New Year's, everything must go, 50-75% off, free shipping, free gift, double patriot points for your next order.
[02:57:05.601 --> 02:57:08.504]  It's been said in the last day for three days, not as sales gimmick.
[02:57:09.986 --> 02:57:15.612]  I'm going to go into meetings at the end of this broadcast, and I'm going to work like a digital beaver.
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:21.486]  To get the new ads cut that you will see throughout the weekend and next week on the new products and all the rest of it.
[02:57:21.506 --> 02:57:29.855]  I know these sales will be history, but my being tied up is your chance to push us over the edge and help us clear everything out at info war store dot com.
[02:57:29.875 --> 02:57:33.659]  Biggest sales of our history and the new website and our new sponsor.
[02:57:34.915 --> 02:57:38.439]  Washington's with an S. Washington's Reserve.
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:43.065]  Pure, organic, hemp-derived CBD oil from the biggest company in the nation.
[02:57:43.405 --> 02:57:44.246]  Private label by us.
[02:57:44.326 --> 02:57:46.869]  No THC, but nothing with incredible health benefits.
[02:57:47.650 --> 02:57:49.012]  More than 30 great products.
[02:57:49.092 --> 02:57:50.594]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:52.396 --> 02:57:52.936]  It's really hard.
[02:57:56.195 --> 02:58:08.111]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't have THC in it, and it's totally legal in all 50 states.
[02:58:09.133 --> 02:58:10.855]  This is where everybody's going.
[02:58:11.889 --> 02:58:14.310]  This is what your body actually needs.
[02:58:15.090 --> 02:58:26.214]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him, now legal and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[02:58:26.935 --> 02:58:33.597]  Now obviously there's been a giant marijuana legalization craze that Soros has funded the last 10 years.
[02:58:34.238 --> 02:58:35.418]  I've not been involved in that.
[02:58:36.772 --> 02:58:37.532]  It's a huge bubble.
[02:58:37.892 --> 02:58:39.093]  This is not marijuana.
[02:58:39.193 --> 02:58:40.674]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[02:58:40.914 --> 02:58:50.598]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes but not the bad attributes that turn people into potheads in their basements picking and eating their boogers.
[02:58:51.558 --> 02:58:55.920]  This is the good CBD from the organic
[02:58:56.240 --> 02:58:56.881]  I think so.
[02:59:17.273 --> 02:59:25.179]  There are different CBD rich hemp oil extractions for many, many, many different uses.
[02:59:25.700 --> 02:59:30.684]  You owe it to yourself to go look at this for yourself and to also understand it helps fund the Hemp Award.
[02:59:31.084 --> 02:59:32.665]  People wonder why I haven't gotten into CBD oil.
[02:59:33.145 --> 02:59:38.269]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it can get you arrested.
[02:59:38.730 --> 02:59:39.610]  This is not that.
[02:59:39.991 --> 02:59:41.092]  Legal in all 50 states.
[02:59:41.472 --> 02:59:43.654]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.
[02:59:43.994 --> 02:59:45.175]  It's totally legal.
[02:59:46.013 --> 02:59:52.537]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we can ship to all 50 states right now from the great website, washingtonsreserve.com.
[02:59:56.299 --> 03:00:00.602]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:00.802 --> 03:00:08.907]  He's pounding down, loaded up and trucking.
[03:00:09.487 --> 03:00:11.789]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done?
[03:00:12.629 --> 03:00:15.711]  We've got a long way to go and a short
[03:00:19.834 --> 03:00:30.819]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[03:00:30.859 --> 03:00:33.460]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:35.241]  Roger Stone's coming up.
[03:00:35.281 --> 03:00:37.742]  He's always loaded with key intel.
[03:00:38.642 --> 03:00:39.623]  Hosting this fourth hour.
[03:00:39.643 --> 03:00:41.103]  I also have two big stories.
[03:00:41.684 --> 03:00:44.465]  I'm going to briefly hit the start of the next segment.
[03:00:45.065 --> 03:00:46.346]  You'll want to stay with us for that.
[03:00:48.092 --> 03:00:58.857]  Uh, you know, that was very disturbing having Wayne Madsen on because all the other leftists won't come on because they follow talking points and they're directed not to do it because they get caught up just reading the talking points.
[03:00:59.377 --> 03:01:00.778]  They can't intellectually defend themselves.
[03:01:00.798 --> 03:01:03.439]  So at a rally, radio, TV, they won't come on here.
[03:01:05.860 --> 03:01:11.663]  But Wayne, it is my educated opinion that
[03:01:15.592 --> 03:01:24.777]  If he wasn't given a script by the Democrats to basically promote, then he somehow had a Vulcan mind meld with him.
[03:01:25.958 --> 03:01:27.899]  And you're like, okay, who cares about Wayne Madsen?
[03:01:28.780 --> 03:01:41.307]  The point is, is that in this economy and in this world, it's very refreshing to have a guest on like Andrew Tate.
[03:01:43.100 --> 03:01:47.521]  Who's lost a lot because he wouldn't back down, but also gained his soul.
[03:01:48.441 --> 03:01:57.963]  And somebody like Wayne, in my opinion, who was just cold-bloodedly going through those talking points in the hopes of getting some more traction with the establishment.
[03:01:58.683 --> 03:02:08.245]  And who wants to live like that, where you've got to go say things on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube that aren't you, so that they promote you?
[03:02:08.285 --> 03:02:11.586]  You know, here's something they've done, I've noticed, it gives you a little bit of the other mindset.
[03:02:12.955 --> 03:02:21.965]  I've always, once a month or so, I've done it less the last few years, done a comedic satire piece.
[03:02:23.787 --> 03:02:26.009]  And the media always misrepresents it and says,
[03:02:27.955 --> 03:02:32.077]  Jones really thinks he's a gay frog, or Jones really thinks he's the Joker, or whatever.
[03:02:32.397 --> 03:02:33.978]  And I always say, no, I'm being an actor.
[03:02:34.018 --> 03:02:35.138]  They go, oh, you're fake then!
[03:02:35.458 --> 03:02:36.219]  As if we're children.
[03:02:36.919 --> 03:02:40.040]  No, I believe what I'm saying, but when I do a joke skit, yeah, it's a gay frog.
[03:02:40.060 --> 03:02:41.241]  Yeah, I don't believe I'm a gay frog.
[03:02:41.481 --> 03:02:44.782]  I've got green paint on my face and a frog outfit on, and I'm hopping around the studio.
[03:02:44.822 --> 03:02:50.605]  Yeah, I think it's self-evident that I'm doing a joke to illustrate so that young people think it's funny.
[03:02:50.625 --> 03:02:51.625]  It's where we go super viral.
[03:02:51.925 --> 03:02:55.667]  More than adults, more than talk radio, more than, I mean, with the young people,
[03:02:56.897 --> 03:02:59.319]  I'm like in the top 10, barely.
[03:03:00.039 --> 03:03:04.042]  PewDiePie is up at the top, and I'm probably down at number 9 or 10.
[03:03:04.583 --> 03:03:05.183]  Very proud of that.
[03:03:05.844 --> 03:03:08.706]  And then they learn about it, and they find the regular show, and that's how we wake them up.
[03:03:08.726 --> 03:03:11.488]  And then I meet them five years later, and they're listeners.
[03:03:12.228 --> 03:03:13.509]  They go, oh, I saw that joke piece.
[03:03:13.529 --> 03:03:13.869]  That was funny.
[03:03:13.889 --> 03:03:16.431]  And then I started listening, and changed my whole life, and now blah, blah, blah.
[03:03:19.414 --> 03:03:21.455]  But they always go, Jones is really desperate.
[03:03:21.495 --> 03:03:25.278]  He did a gay frog bit, or he did a bit with a donkey hat on.
[03:03:27.421 --> 03:03:28.342]  I've always done that.
[03:03:29.122 --> 03:03:30.964]  I'm not changing what I do.
[03:03:31.564 --> 03:03:33.706]  In fact, I never did that consciously.
[03:03:34.987 --> 03:03:42.372]  Before memes were even the big thing, five, six years ago, people would be like, you know, you're a genius, saying all those memes and how you act stupid.
[03:03:43.453 --> 03:03:44.954]  And I'm like, I like to act stupid.
[03:03:49.710 --> 03:03:57.235]  I don't look at a Texas Monthly cover story of me as a crying, cowardly wimp with a tinfoil viking hat on and think, oh my god, I'm so serious!
[03:03:57.715 --> 03:03:58.776]  They're not taking me serious!
[03:03:59.136 --> 03:03:59.997]  I like it!
[03:04:01.497 --> 03:04:07.061]  I don't like the lies inside the article, but I understand that goes with the territory.
[03:04:08.862 --> 03:04:10.643]  But see, why is that important?
[03:04:10.683 --> 03:04:16.167]  Because to them, they think I'm geeking out and acting stupid
[03:04:17.438 --> 03:04:20.620]  To then get under the radar so that they leave me up.
[03:04:23.582 --> 03:04:29.646]  When I was never even trying to get under the radar, I was just having fun and also trying to illustrate to people.
[03:04:31.447 --> 03:04:37.791]  And some people I've talked to that are really smart, they go, Jones, would you stop telling them how this really works?
[03:04:37.911 --> 03:04:41.293]  I have a neurosis, I tell the truth.
[03:04:41.654 --> 03:04:42.294]  It's a neurosis.
[03:04:43.635 --> 03:04:44.636]  My wife says, you like this outfit?
[03:04:44.656 --> 03:04:44.956]  I go, no.
[03:04:46.847 --> 03:04:51.010]  I just have trouble lying to people.
[03:04:53.812 --> 03:04:56.495]  But that's what it comes down to.
[03:04:56.535 --> 03:04:57.496]  Roger Stone straight ahead.
[03:04:57.596 --> 03:04:58.476]  Two big stories.
[03:04:59.417 --> 03:05:00.879]  Believe me, they're big in 60 seconds.
[03:05:03.120 --> 03:05:04.021]  The globalists know.
[03:05:04.181 --> 03:05:05.341]  Defeat the globalists.
[03:05:05.842 --> 03:05:07.002]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:07.563 --> 03:05:08.643]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[03:05:09.084 --> 03:05:10.184]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:11.125 --> 03:05:15.387]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:16.028 --> 03:05:19.250]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:19.830 --> 03:05:27.895]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:28.815 --> 03:05:31.237]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[03:05:31.617 --> 03:05:38.183]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[03:05:38.883 --> 03:05:42.767]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[03:05:42.847 --> 03:05:48.732]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[03:05:48.792 --> 03:05:51.614]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[03:05:51.834 --> 03:05:53.075]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:05:53.335 --> 03:05:56.378]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:06:00.287 --> 03:06:02.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:36.086 --> 03:06:44.890]  On this Friday, January 4th, 2019 edition that Roger Stone's about to host his fourth hour, he wants to take your phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[03:06:46.050 --> 03:06:54.634]  So it's your chance to talk to the demonized man of the hour, evil Ruski agent with no evidence, Roger Stone!
[03:06:54.654 --> 03:06:54.694]  877-789-2539.
[03:06:54.714 --> 03:06:55.034]  877-789-Alex.
[03:06:55.054 --> 03:06:56.834]  Questions for Roger Stone, because I'm about to eject
[03:07:05.037 --> 03:07:12.469]  Out of this seat and get into the news, 877-789-2539 is the number to join Roger Stone on this Worldwide Friday Edition.
[03:07:12.849 --> 03:07:14.152]  Now, two big news items.
[03:07:14.172 --> 03:07:17.016]  Can we go to InfoWars.com for TV viewers, please?
[03:07:17.950 --> 03:07:28.698]  There's a live feed we did, which I never do, during my own show of a 30-minute interview or discussion I had with the crew today dealing with Bird Box.
[03:07:29.519 --> 03:07:32.261]  So, can we go to InfoWars.com front page?
[03:07:33.202 --> 03:07:36.785]  Alex Jones to release secret meaning of new Sandra Bullock film, Bird Box.
[03:07:39.039 --> 03:07:45.167]  And yes, I'm hijacking this number one film seen by 60 million people the last two weeks to break down its real meaning.
[03:07:45.367 --> 03:07:48.131]  I was watching it five minutes and could tell the real meaning.
[03:07:50.612 --> 03:07:55.636]  And then I called folks that had seen it, and I said, let me guess, this is how it ends.
[03:07:55.656 --> 03:07:56.817]  And they said, how do you know that?
[03:07:56.837 --> 03:07:58.659]  And I said, I know the script.
[03:07:59.319 --> 03:08:11.329]  In this 30-minute piece that I did today, just raw audio, they added a bunch of video to it, I break down this big issue of how they're rolling out, admitting their plan in this film and in the first Kingsman.
[03:08:11.929 --> 03:08:14.751]  And tomorrow, I'm coming down here, I'm going to be on here eight hours.
[03:08:15.728 --> 03:08:20.950]  Putting out a masterpiece detailing all this because it's a major epiphany to understanding what's going on.
[03:08:21.330 --> 03:08:22.330]  That's the first big story.
[03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:24.551]  Next up, you talk about hilarious.
[03:08:24.611 --> 03:08:27.312]  The video is up on InfoWars.com.
[03:08:28.132 --> 03:08:32.994]  Armed hippies lead We Will Not Comply resistance against gunman.
[03:08:35.475 --> 03:08:35.895]  That's right.
[03:08:36.635 --> 03:08:38.036]  Leptis hippies who helped to
[03:08:40.828 --> 03:08:45.193]  Happen to be gun owners are leading the resistance against a new gun ban in Boulder, Colorado.
[03:08:45.633 --> 03:08:52.882]  The city banned the possession and sale of numerous semi-automatic firearms back in June is now demanding residents who own such weapons turn them in.
[03:08:54.025 --> 03:08:55.406]  And now armed hippies.
[03:08:55.426 --> 03:08:56.287]  There's video of it.
[03:08:56.307 --> 03:08:57.367]  We're going to add that to the top.
[03:08:58.028 --> 03:09:00.830]  Maybe hit refresh on the article, guys, because I told them during the break to add that.
[03:09:01.290 --> 03:09:04.873]  They are now marching, armed liberals and hippies, arming themselves.
[03:09:04.913 --> 03:09:13.119]  Kind of like in Europe, we've got people that are socialists now against open borders because they get it is about bankrupting the country.
[03:09:13.579 --> 03:09:15.140]  And you can scroll down, you can see the video.
[03:09:16.802 --> 03:09:18.083]  They're on InfoWars.com.
[03:09:20.268 --> 03:09:24.149]  And NewsWars.com, and it's totally upsetting the leftist.
[03:09:26.670 --> 03:09:34.571]  Roger Stone, I don't want to go down this rabbit hole, this rat hole anymore, because my gut tells me it's not true, there's no evidence, and it's a Democrat talking point.
[03:09:34.591 --> 03:09:48.655]  But I had Wayne Madsen on earlier, and he said Trump is unhinged, Trump basically is Hitler, all Democratic talking points, and that there's these Jane Doe's that say that, you know, he and Epstein buggered them and all this with no evidence.
[03:09:49.682 --> 03:09:57.049]  And meanwhile, we've got Clinton on the plane 24 times, Hillary, all the different Democrats flying around on it.
[03:09:57.950 --> 03:10:01.633]  You've got Total Protection, Hillary's first job representing pedophiles.
[03:10:02.534 --> 03:10:04.676]  You've got the Podesta emails.
[03:10:04.716 --> 03:10:07.899]  You've got all their history of the UN caught doing it.
[03:10:08.380 --> 03:10:10.262]  And then I'm just hearing that Trump
[03:10:11.113 --> 03:10:16.801]  Uh, is, uh, with Epstein, with, with no evidence other than him at parties saying, oh, Epstein, he's a great guy.
[03:10:16.861 --> 03:10:18.904]  Trump says that about everybody, including me.
[03:10:19.364 --> 03:10:21.027]  So it's not about defending Trump.
[03:10:21.087 --> 03:10:24.772]  It's just that they're really scared of the Epstein stuff coming out.
[03:10:24.792 --> 03:10:28.477]  Uh, and, and, and so how does that tie into Sloppy Joe and the rest of this?
[03:10:29.775 --> 03:10:32.198]  Well Alex, first of all, you made a great point earlier.
[03:10:32.258 --> 03:10:41.827]  You know, it's so funny how the left loves Stephen Colbert and these late night comedians when they use parody and satire and humor to make a serious point.
[03:10:42.268 --> 03:10:47.613]  But when you do it, and you do it extremely effectively, oh, Jones is unhinged.
[03:10:48.054 --> 03:10:51.958]  It really is just another demonstration of leftist hypocrisy.
[03:10:52.678 --> 03:11:00.303]  I examined the whole question of Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump extensively for my book, The Clinton's War on Women.
[03:11:00.363 --> 03:11:02.404]  There's an entire chapter on it.
[03:11:02.744 --> 03:11:04.646]  Sorry, Wayne, you're wrong.
[03:11:04.966 --> 03:11:17.994]  The relationship between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein is essentially a financial one, only in the sense that Epstein pays $300,000 a year to belong to Donald Trump's very exclusive club in Palm Beach.
[03:11:19.223 --> 03:11:31.032]  Trump admits to going to Epstein's home one time because Epstein badgered him to go to a party at his palatial mansion in Palm Beach during daylight hours.
[03:11:31.592 --> 03:11:40.599]  Trump said to his driver as they pulled up and saw a bunch of kids frolicking in the pool, wow that Jeff Epstein's a nice guy letting the neighborhood girls
[03:11:41.027 --> 03:11:42.508]  And kids play in his pool.
[03:11:42.989 --> 03:11:51.616]  He went inside, became extremely uncomfortable over the fact that he was one of only three men there, and the rest were underage girls, and he left.
[03:11:52.196 --> 03:12:05.608]  If anyone, including Robert Morrow or Wayne Madsen, has any actual evidence of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein abusing underage children, put it forward, because it does not exist.
[03:12:05.888 --> 03:12:07.170]  Well, let's expand on that.
[03:12:08.331 --> 03:12:12.396]  Mueller, it's been reported in the news, used Epstein as a confidential informant.
[03:12:12.996 --> 03:12:15.299]  Mueller transferred uranium on the tarmac to the Russians.
[03:12:16.140 --> 03:12:18.383]  And when I brought that up to Wayne, he'd never heard of such a thing.
[03:12:19.754 --> 03:12:41.571]  The important thing to understand here is that the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, according to a bombshell new series of stories in the Miami Herald, only weeks ago documented the fact that Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked over 80 underage children of both sexes to his various pedophile friends around the globe.
[03:12:41.651 --> 03:12:44.133]  And the only Trump connection is, one of the U.S.
[03:12:44.173 --> 03:12:46.895]  prosecutors that whitewashed it, Trump, did a point.
[03:12:46.955 --> 03:12:49.237]  So, I think Trump should throw that person under the bus.
[03:12:50.026 --> 03:12:58.412]  I agree, but I have determined with absolute authority that Donald Trump was never told that this fellow Acosta had been the U.S.
[03:12:58.472 --> 03:13:00.493]  Attorney in the Epstein matter.
[03:13:00.593 --> 03:13:07.498]  The better question, the more important question is, why was Epstein allowed to plead to one count of soliciting a minor?
[03:13:07.958 --> 03:13:14.843]  Why did he serve only 13 months of a 15-month sentence in the air-conditioned Palm Beach County Jail?
[03:13:15.363 --> 03:13:19.646]  Could it be because he was an FBI informant for, yes, you guessed it,
[03:13:20.066 --> 03:13:21.166]  Robert Mueller.
[03:13:22.807 --> 03:13:23.587]  Wow, okay.
[03:13:23.767 --> 03:13:26.088]  I just crashed the show today to bring those points up.
[03:13:26.508 --> 03:13:28.189]  What else do you have coming up here, Roger?
[03:13:28.209 --> 03:13:29.469]  You're going to take calls, obviously.
[03:13:30.350 --> 03:13:37.012]  I am, but Alex, one of the things I want to point out is once again, we here at InfoWars have reported tomorrow's news today.
[03:13:37.672 --> 03:13:41.834]  I told you earlier that Mitt Romney's candidacy for the U.S.
[03:13:41.854 --> 03:13:47.055]  Senate in Utah was designed as a platform for a challenge to President Donald Trump.
[03:13:47.075 --> 03:13:48.616]  You said that over and over again for a year.
[03:13:49.822 --> 03:14:04.567]  And when Donald Trump endorsed Mitt Romney in the Republican primary over the state treasurer, who was a Trump supporter, and thinking of running, I said it was an egregious mistake and it would be... So this was pure treachery?
[03:14:05.589 --> 03:14:06.490]  Complete treachery.
[03:14:06.610 --> 03:14:07.311]  Let me say this.
[03:14:07.511 --> 03:14:08.532]  There's a lot going on.
[03:14:08.592 --> 03:14:10.113]  We'll get into it on the other side.
[03:14:10.613 --> 03:14:24.005]  But Romney, Flake, Kasich, and that cabal have a plan A and a plan B. Plan A is for one of them, most likely Romney, to challenge Donald Trump in the Republican primaries.
[03:14:24.385 --> 03:14:33.473]  The problem with that is a new round of polling, which has been leaked to me, shows that Donald Trump would crush any of them in the Republican primaries.
[03:14:33.493 --> 03:14:36.179]  Now let me guess what's happened to your head for TV viewers.
[03:14:36.219 --> 03:14:39.867]  Did somebody close the trunk door on your head?
[03:14:42.083 --> 03:14:43.024]  Actually, no.
[03:14:43.464 --> 03:14:47.929]  One of my dogs, because I have four of them who sleep in the bed with me, scratched me in the middle of the night.
[03:14:48.329 --> 03:14:49.330]  Boy, that's happened to me.
[03:14:49.430 --> 03:14:50.611]  That has certainly happened to me.
[03:14:51.552 --> 03:14:55.316]  My wife has two cats, and they were fighting and scratched the hell out of me.
[03:14:55.636 --> 03:14:56.757]  I saw that myself.
[03:14:56.897 --> 03:15:02.002]  So, no, I did not repel an attacker with a knife, although it's a hell of a good story.
[03:15:02.342 --> 03:15:04.725]  This was done by one of my Yorkshire Terriers.
[03:15:05.566 --> 03:15:07.668]  Alright, you're taking over with loaded phones.
[03:15:07.888 --> 03:15:08.949]  Roger Stone on the other side.
[03:15:08.989 --> 03:15:14.134]  Whatever you do, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:15:14.634 --> 03:15:16.716]  Folks, if you don't spread the links, nobody does.
[03:15:16.736 --> 03:15:17.276]  You've been doing it.
[03:15:17.296 --> 03:15:17.917]  We've been kicking butt.
[03:15:17.937 --> 03:15:18.437]  It's amazing.
[03:15:18.457 --> 03:15:20.199]  It's really making the globalists angry.
[03:15:20.699 --> 03:15:24.503]  But just the best videos, the best articles, whatever you think is most important, email it.
[03:15:25.143 --> 03:15:26.024]  Text it to your friends.
[03:15:26.344 --> 03:15:27.124]  Text it to your neighbors.
[03:15:27.565 --> 03:15:30.066]  Tell people about local radio stations at red lights.
[03:15:30.106 --> 03:15:31.947]  Hey, Alex Jones is verboten.
[03:15:32.207 --> 03:15:33.988]  Find out why he's on this local station.
[03:15:34.489 --> 03:15:40.693]  The power of you and word of mouth is the most powerful thing in the world in this age of social media.
[03:15:41.093 --> 03:15:43.474]  And you've been doing it, so I want to thank you.
[03:15:44.835 --> 03:15:46.456]  And we're saying to the globalists, there's censorship.
[03:15:46.916 --> 03:15:47.277]  Nine!
[03:15:48.334 --> 03:15:49.435]  It's okay to be a man.
[03:15:49.475 --> 03:15:50.397]  It's okay to be white.
[03:15:50.637 --> 03:15:51.518]  It's okay to be black.
[03:15:51.558 --> 03:15:52.539]  It's okay to be American.
[03:15:52.799 --> 03:15:53.921]  It's okay to be capitalist.
[03:15:53.941 --> 03:15:54.942]  It's okay to be Hispanic.
[03:15:55.202 --> 03:15:56.143]  It's okay to be human.
[03:15:56.684 --> 03:16:00.769]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone, your phone calls and more on the Friday edition.
[03:16:12.836 --> 03:16:15.018]  I'm now joined by Leo Zagami.
[03:16:15.659 --> 03:16:17.020]  LeoZagami.com.
[03:16:17.060 --> 03:16:19.662]  He's got a lot of great books that you can find there.
[03:16:19.682 --> 03:16:20.663]  A lot of great stories.
[03:16:20.923 --> 03:16:25.687]  And he is, for me, the resident expert when it comes to all things Vatican.
[03:16:25.727 --> 03:16:26.788]  So he joins me today.
[03:16:26.969 --> 03:16:31.893]  Now, the story here is, they're calling him a medium, miracle healer, whatever you want to say.
[03:16:32.133 --> 03:16:34.974]  Very famous in Brazil, known as Jao de Jus.
[03:16:35.174 --> 03:16:35.915]  John of God.
[03:16:36.035 --> 03:16:38.596]  He was interviewed once on the Oprah Winfrey Show.
[03:16:38.756 --> 03:16:40.357]  Treated President Bill Clinton.
[03:16:40.617 --> 03:16:47.120]  So, it comes out, though, that this guy was basically ritualistically abusing, apparently sexually assaulting women.
[03:16:47.400 --> 03:16:49.061]  Over 300, according to this report.
[03:16:49.081 --> 03:16:50.282]  It's a big story right now going on.
[03:16:50.422 --> 03:16:59.086]  And so, Leo, while they are basically interrogating this person, and they're interrogating him, Leo, and all of a sudden, weird, crazy stuff starts to happen.
[03:16:59.626 --> 03:17:12.616]  Circuits start to explode, computers start to take a mind of its own, and so now the police interrogating this person are basically like kind of going through like some sort of like let's say exorcism, and they're just having to remain extra focused just to even get this interrogation completed.
[03:17:12.656 --> 03:17:17.179]  But Leo, talk about how this is not something new and how this is something very real.
[03:17:17.239 --> 03:17:26.186]  I mean people can see this, you know, they talk about exorcism and stuff, but I mean these demons, these we'll call them interdimensional demons, a lot of people in Hollywood try to communicate with them, a lot of people in
[03:17:26.426 --> 03:17:30.749]  Already, I think over 10 years ago, this John of God appeared in various forums denounced as a pedophile.
[03:17:30.849 --> 03:17:33.991]  So why did they let him do what he has done up until now?
[03:17:51.701 --> 03:18:06.466]  Brazil is a place full of witch doctors and of black magic and I mean the extra dimensional powers that you are approaching with these rituals are taken very seriously especially in Brazil and so this explains you that there is a
[03:18:07.046 --> 03:18:07.667]  We're good.
[03:18:21.823 --> 03:18:33.046]  Thanks to specific places, because there is a sort of stargate, doors to unknown dimensions that have always been there since ancient times.
[03:18:33.106 --> 03:18:35.867]  But you have higher realms and lower realms.
[03:18:35.987 --> 03:18:44.630]  So you have the angelic beings on top, but you have also the demonic ones below that are the ones who actually control matter.
[03:18:45.150 --> 03:18:52.656]  So most of these Illuminati, if you want to define them as Illuminati, they are members of various secret societies.
[03:18:53.016 --> 03:19:00.682]  They base their power on low-level demons that they maintain control over for hundreds of years.
[03:19:00.782 --> 03:19:07.207]  And that means that their secret society has made a specific, maybe, deal with those demons or with that demon.
[03:19:07.668 --> 03:19:11.911]  And they maintain that relationship through sacrifices of various kinds.
[03:19:12.031 --> 03:19:25.944]  I actually met Catholic bishops who were linked to black magic, Brazilian sects, and they were involved in all these things that are well beyond the ordinary beacon magic.
[03:19:26.225 --> 03:19:33.632]  We're talking here about very serious forms of witchcraft based on ancient grimoires that are very dangerous.
[03:19:33.792 --> 03:19:40.359]  And I think that that is what probably the story is with this John of God, Jao de Jus, down in Brazil.
[03:19:40.580 --> 03:19:48.689]  He probably made some deals with the devil and these demons are trying to do whatever they can to disrupt God's justice coming to this man who has been accused of assaulting over 300 women.
[03:19:48.949 --> 03:19:50.010]  Leo Zegami, thank you so much.
[03:19:50.070 --> 03:19:51.432]  Great stuff as always, Leo.
[03:19:51.472 --> 03:19:53.334]  Get his new book, The Invisible Master.
[03:19:53.614 --> 03:19:55.116]  leozegami.com is his website.
[03:20:06.316 --> 03:20:08.908]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:28.803 --> 03:20:35.387]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:35.867 --> 03:20:38.749]  And now, your host, Roger Stone.
[03:20:41.630 --> 03:20:42.430]  Welcome back.
[03:20:42.870 --> 03:20:48.052]  You're on the Alex Jones Show, and as you heard previously, we're going to be taking your calls.
[03:20:48.492 --> 03:20:54.634]  So that number, 877-789-2539, with the enormous turmoil in Washington, with the Democrats taking control of the House, with Donald Trump holding tough for
[03:21:03.237 --> 03:21:03.477]  I think?
[03:21:21.020 --> 03:21:33.122]  I do want to mention that on New Year's Day, the 13th annual international best and worst dressed list that I produce every year hit the pages of the Daily Caller.
[03:21:34.063 --> 03:21:41.004]  And I'm happy to say that that in turn was picked up by the New York Post, which in turn was picked up by the Drudge Report.
[03:21:41.364 --> 03:21:48.966]  So a hearty thanks to both the New York Post and Richard Johnson, and of course to Matt Drudge and the Drudge Report.
[03:21:49.366 --> 03:21:50.606]  But most importantly,
[03:21:50.666 --> 03:21:51.548]  We're good.
[03:22:05.746 --> 03:22:12.635]  That means that he could be heading for the Lifetime Achievement Award, which is very coveted.
[03:22:13.476 --> 03:22:21.487]  Larry Kudlow, Shannon Sharp, Kimberly Guilfoyle, a small handful of those who are truly turned out.
[03:22:22.282 --> 03:22:25.405]  And everything we said about Owen Schroer is true.
[03:22:25.525 --> 03:22:29.448]  He's amazingly well turned out for a young man of his age.
[03:22:29.929 --> 03:22:33.172]  Today, he's referred to as an associate of Roger Stone.
[03:22:33.592 --> 03:22:38.496]  Someday, I will be referred to as an associate of Owen Schroer.
[03:22:38.916 --> 03:22:41.539]  So, now let's go to the phones, if we may.
[03:22:41.859 --> 03:22:44.301]  Let's start with Brad in Pennsylvania.
[03:22:44.661 --> 03:22:47.504]  Brad, you're on InfoWars and the Alex Jones Show.
[03:22:47.804 --> 03:22:48.725]  What's on your mind?
[03:22:49.870 --> 03:22:51.591]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Roger.
[03:22:51.611 --> 03:23:06.463]  I just wanted to mention, you pointed out Mitt Romney, and my feeling is, with all the... I want to get your opinion on this, but with all the elections recently, it just seems like they're just giving us the results.
[03:23:06.643 --> 03:23:08.745]  There's no honest elections anymore.
[03:23:08.765 --> 03:23:17.132]  They're just telling... I think they would have said Beto would have beaten Cruz, except for that stuff that Infowars came up with.
[03:23:17.924 --> 03:23:28.788]  Down there in Texas, if you guys wouldn't have broken that story about him buying whatever he was doing down there, I think they would have said he would have beat Cruz.
[03:23:28.808 --> 03:23:41.894]  I think they just make up this stuff and they're going to take Romney, just like you're pointing out, they're going to run him in the primaries and probably, like they used to do to Ron Paul, they're just going to say he beat Trump somehow and we're supposed to believe it.
[03:23:43.174 --> 03:23:47.156]  No, I think you raise an excellent point and this is my number one concern.
[03:23:47.196 --> 03:23:47.496]  You see,
[03:23:48.406 --> 03:23:51.348]  In 2016, we actually had an honest election.
[03:23:51.848 --> 03:23:58.472]  That's because the two-party duopoly that runs the election system and the government was overconfident.
[03:23:58.832 --> 03:24:05.036]  They were so certain that they had the election wired to be a face-off between Jeb Bush
[03:24:05.536 --> 03:24:11.279]  In Hillary Clinton, heads I win, tails you lose, there was no way for them to lose.
[03:24:11.759 --> 03:24:21.123]  Then, in the general election, where they unwisely regarded Donald Trump as some kind of cartoon character, they never saw it coming.
[03:24:21.463 --> 03:24:31.228]  Therefore, they did not go to the lengths that they went to in the most recent midterm elections, which I think were wracked with fraud and illegal voting.
[03:24:31.798 --> 03:24:36.520]  The president has two years and a Justice Department to do something about this.
[03:24:36.900 --> 03:24:38.180]  You're absolutely right.
[03:24:38.520 --> 03:24:41.181]  Donald Trump can win an honest election.
[03:24:41.221 --> 03:24:45.483]  In fact, I think he would wallop Mitt Romney in an honest election.
[03:24:45.543 --> 03:24:52.165]  In fact, polls that have been taken by the cabal, the the Kasich, Flake,
[03:24:52.965 --> 03:25:03.014]  Corker, Romney, Stewart, Stevens, Cabal showed that Donald Trump would wallop the Mormon from Utah in a head-to-head Republican primary.
[03:25:03.474 --> 03:25:14.643]  And that's why there are talks about running a third-party independent candidacy to try to split the Republican vote in an effort to elect a globalist Democrat.
[03:25:15.023 --> 03:25:17.545]  There's John Kasich, not looking too good.
[03:25:17.866 --> 03:25:20.508]  That's how you look when you stay up all night freebasing.
[03:25:21.368 --> 03:25:24.749]  This guy is one of the great hypocrites of all time.
[03:25:25.370 --> 03:25:43.636]  A guy who's a drug warrior and has so badly destroyed the legal process for medicinal marijuana in Ohio, which has been so badly mishandled that literally hundreds of thousands of Ohioans who are relying on cannabis as medicine
[03:25:44.116 --> 03:25:52.500]  Better than, say, opioids, are forced to wait because of an incompetent administration by John Kasich.
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:25:54.560]  Thank you very much for your call.
[03:25:55.381 --> 03:25:58.662]  Let's go to Joe in Colorado.
[03:25:58.742 --> 03:25:59.843]  Joe, what's on your mind?
[03:25:59.863 --> 03:26:02.144]  How you doing, Roger?
[03:26:03.044 --> 03:26:03.424]  Excellent.
[03:26:04.585 --> 03:26:05.445]  Good to hear it, buddy.
[03:26:05.565 --> 03:26:07.406]  Hey man, I just want to say that
[03:26:08.939 --> 03:26:10.241]  You're a real inspiration, man.
[03:26:10.281 --> 03:26:12.844]  I know you're going through a lot of crap and you're standing strong.
[03:26:13.686 --> 03:26:18.893]  I think I speak for all red-blooded Americans that you're a true inspiration.
[03:26:20.632 --> 03:26:22.013]  Well, that's very kind.
[03:26:22.033 --> 03:26:23.253]  I want to be honest with you.
[03:26:23.293 --> 03:26:30.857]  In December, I had to cancel my life and health insurance because I literally could not make the premium payments.
[03:26:31.397 --> 03:26:36.220]  That's because every penny that I can scrape together has to go to pay my lawyers.
[03:26:36.660 --> 03:26:44.404]  Because as you know, I am the subject of a witch hunt by Robert Mueller, a legal proctological examination in which
[03:26:44.944 --> 03:26:52.786]  Virtually every friend, current and former, that I have has been dragged either in front of the FBI or in front of the grand jury.
[03:26:53.226 --> 03:26:55.426]  My cleaning lady has been interrogated.
[03:26:55.566 --> 03:26:58.967]  FBI agents were seen rooting through my garbage.
[03:26:59.587 --> 03:27:03.608]  And they, of course, work closely with the mainstream media.
[03:27:03.668 --> 03:27:08.309]  So the special counsel, which allegedly doesn't leak, leaks like a sieve.
[03:27:08.849 --> 03:27:10.750]  That causes negative stories.
[03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:19.695]  If I had $100 for every story that predicted that I would be indicted tomorrow, I'd be able to pay my legal expenses easily.
[03:27:19.975 --> 03:27:21.536]  But unfortunately, I'm unable to.
[03:27:22.016 --> 03:27:25.778]  Those who want to help can go to stonedefensefund.com.
[03:27:28.659 --> 03:27:32.820]  Yes, I am accepting contributions and I will be grateful for them.
[03:27:33.300 --> 03:27:40.482]  Again, don't go to RogerStoneDefenseFund.com because that will take you to a Planned Parenthood site.
[03:27:40.882 --> 03:27:44.023]  It's StoneDefenseFund.com.
[03:27:44.463 --> 03:27:47.044]  Many thanks for your questions and your warm wishes.
[03:27:50.124 --> 03:27:55.446]  Why don't we go to, let's see, Carl in Pennsylvania.
[03:27:55.506 --> 03:27:56.706]  Carl, what's on your mind?
[03:27:58.015 --> 03:27:59.176]  How are you doing today, Roger?
[03:28:00.277 --> 03:28:00.617]  Excellent.
[03:28:00.657 --> 03:28:01.077]  Thank you.
[03:28:01.097 --> 03:28:02.799]  Excellent.
[03:28:02.859 --> 03:28:05.221]  Actually, not Pennsylvania, San Diego.
[03:28:06.001 --> 03:28:06.762]  I apologize.
[03:28:06.842 --> 03:28:07.863]  I got that wrong.
[03:28:07.923 --> 03:28:08.904]  But Carl, go ahead.
[03:28:09.764 --> 03:28:10.305]  Not a problem.
[03:28:10.325 --> 03:28:11.386]  Not a problem.
[03:28:11.946 --> 03:28:22.074]  First thing I wanted to just kind of briefly mention here is that I'm down here in San Diego, and I go back and forth across the border, you know, relatively often.
[03:28:22.895 --> 03:28:27.058]  And, you know, and one of my buddies has a house down there.
[03:28:27.941 --> 03:28:49.251]  So I show up you know and we're talking about the caravan and you know a lot of the people who are down there they're like you know what this whole thing is a mess we don't want these people here they're robbing they're looting you know and there's just hordes of them running around and the whole situation is just kind of a mess I mean this is for me being down there first hand to talk
[03:28:50.194 --> 03:28:54.359]  Carl, I'm going to ask you to hold that clock.
[03:28:54.819 --> 03:28:57.802]  I'm Roger Stone, you're on the Alex Jones Show, and we'll be right back.
[03:29:10.356 --> 03:29:22.869]  I don't know where these markets are going to go, but if the globalists have their way, they're going to go straight down, along with your job, and along with your pay increase, and along with everything you hold dear, because these globalists want to economically capture you, and bankrupt you, and control you.
[03:29:24.391 --> 03:29:33.019]  But if you use the free energy of word of mouth, the most powerful thing in the universe, creativity, if you tell folks about InfoWars.com,
[03:29:34.787 --> 03:29:39.489]  Or NewsWars.com, or that local radio station that picks us up, or that local TV station that picks us up.
[03:29:39.589 --> 03:29:57.634]  If you spread the word about InfoWars.com, Ford's last show, if you go to InfoWarsStore.com and look at the amazing products on every front that make your life better, that make your children's life better, that make your family's life better, then you're stepping out of their control and using your economic and cultural power to smash them.
[03:29:57.714 --> 03:29:59.595]  So I would encourage everyone, Christmas,
[03:30:00.015 --> 03:30:04.719]  Ordering is over, but right through to the new year, we have a store-wide clearance sale going.
[03:30:05.380 --> 03:30:21.855]  Store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points for your next order, a free t-shirt with every order, 50 to 75% off many of these items we lose money on, but I believe you're going to experience how great our fluoride-free, super blue toothpaste is, fortified with a little silver and iodine and other essential oils.
[03:30:22.075 --> 03:30:25.258]  I think you're going to experience how amazing it is, and you're going to want to reorder it.
[03:30:25.578 --> 03:30:35.944]  I think you're going to experience how amazing our colloidal silver bullet is, or how great RainForce Plus our nootropic is, or how amazing our body's ultimate turmeric formula, 95% cucuminoid.
[03:30:36.004 --> 03:30:37.105]  No one else even has that.
[03:30:37.205 --> 03:30:39.226]  The anti-inflammation powers are biblical.
[03:30:39.386 --> 03:30:43.588]  I believe in you, and I believe that you want freedom, and you want justice, and you want a future.
[03:30:43.729 --> 03:30:47.391]  And you understand that by financing InfoWars, you can't lose.
[03:30:47.731 --> 03:30:54.395]  Because you get products that are great for you and your family, you get a great deal, and you fund and support an organization totally.
[03:30:55.075 --> 03:31:00.357]  And completely, absolutely turned over to the fight against the Globeless.
[03:31:01.057 --> 03:31:01.457]  Committed.
[03:31:01.897 --> 03:31:02.718]  Beyond commitment.
[03:31:03.358 --> 03:31:07.599]  Until my very individuality has been absorbed in the fight.
[03:31:08.000 --> 03:31:09.060]  And that's a damn good feeling.
[03:31:09.900 --> 03:31:11.681]  Because I'm the ultimate individualist.
[03:31:12.401 --> 03:31:13.482]  I'm the ultimate collectivist.
[03:31:14.002 --> 03:31:16.543]  The individual is powerful and is strong.
[03:31:16.983 --> 03:31:28.228]  When the individual chooses God and justice and joins the collective, it's a collective of individuals forming the true collective, not the false collective of the devil, Lucifer, whatever you want to call it that is slavery.
[03:31:28.508 --> 03:31:33.671]  Not a top-down collective, but a collective of common sense and the people that is transcendent.
[03:31:34.691 --> 03:31:39.576]  And it's in that true collective that humanity will reach the stars and go beyond.
[03:31:40.256 --> 03:31:50.766]  So as Christmas passes us, and 2018 goes into legend, into history, it's your chance to financially support the very tip of the spear of the fight against the globalists and get great products at the same time.
[03:31:51.287 --> 03:31:54.069]  A true 360 win, unless you don't take advantage of it.
[03:31:54.350 --> 03:31:54.850]  Please stay with us.
[03:32:07.628 --> 03:32:09.529]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.

[03:33:06.201 --> 03:33:19.210]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.850 --> 03:33:29.397]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[03:33:29.957 --> 03:33:31.599]  It's Roger Stone.
[03:33:35.145 --> 03:33:35.905]  Welcome back.
[03:33:36.165 --> 03:33:39.366]  I'm Roger Stone sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:33:39.426 --> 03:33:44.648]  We've still got Carl from San Diego on the line and we're going to go back to him in one second.
[03:33:44.688 --> 03:33:49.349]  But in the meantime, I want to tell you the phone number for those who want to get through on the hotline is 877-789-2539.
[03:33:49.369 --> 03:33:52.750]  I'm taking your calls today on any subject you want to talk about.
[03:33:57.872 --> 03:33:59.273]  We've got a good lineup.
[03:33:59.353 --> 03:34:01.333]  Theodore, Malcolm, John in Wyoming.
[03:34:01.613 --> 03:34:03.694]  We're going to try to get to as many of you as possible.
[03:34:04.014 --> 03:34:05.755]  Carl, let's pick up where we left off.
[03:34:05.815 --> 03:34:06.235]  Go ahead.
[03:34:07.255 --> 03:34:07.755]  Yes, sir.
[03:34:07.835 --> 03:34:11.477]  Anyways, so that was my quick little point about the border.
[03:34:11.697 --> 03:34:17.259]  Moving on to the next point I want to make is I've been listening to you guys for about 10 years.
[03:34:17.279 --> 03:34:21.620]  And just being able to, you know, do my own research, like Alex always says,
[03:34:22.338 --> 03:34:22.758]  We're good to go.
[03:34:45.467 --> 03:34:47.893]  Everybody keeps saying impeach, impeach, impeach.
[03:34:48.394 --> 03:34:50.739]  These people couldn't impeach a ham sandwich.
[03:34:51.160 --> 03:34:55.170]  I mean, I know you could indict one all day long, but who's buying this narrative?
[03:34:56.829 --> 03:34:58.830]  Well, I wish I agreed with you.
[03:34:58.890 --> 03:35:12.198]  First of all, I think the House Democrats are about to have a giant internal rumble between their corporatist wing, which controls Nancy Pelosi, and their socialist wing, which is growing in force and size.
[03:35:12.859 --> 03:35:19.823]  The point is, they don't need real evidence, real facts, real proof, real anything to vote articles of impeachment.
[03:35:20.383 --> 03:35:22.124]  Then it would go to the U.S.
[03:35:22.164 --> 03:35:23.865]  Senate for an actual trial.
[03:35:24.406 --> 03:35:29.849]  Impeachment, I think, is widely misunderstood by the American people.
[03:35:30.269 --> 03:35:32.690]  To be impeached is to be accused.
[03:35:33.471 --> 03:35:34.371]  It's an indictment.
[03:35:34.671 --> 03:35:38.374]  Bill Clinton was impeached, but he was not convicted.
[03:35:38.794 --> 03:35:47.439]  President Andrew Johnson, who succeeded Abraham Lincoln, was impeached, but he was not convicted and therefore removed.
[03:35:47.919 --> 03:35:50.660]  It requires a two-thirds vote in the U.S.
[03:35:50.720 --> 03:35:52.541]  Senate for a conviction.
[03:35:52.981 --> 03:36:00.503]  Therefore, we'll be counting on senators like Mitt Romney, for example, which is what gives me pause.
[03:36:01.063 --> 03:36:15.208]  If you saw the kind of hysteria that the mainstream media was able to whip up regarding Judge Kavanaugh, based on absolutely nothing, you see the kind of hysteria they can whip up about
[03:36:15.968 --> 03:36:29.639]  Donald Trump and let's say campaign finance crimes that may not even exist because the chairman of the Federal Election Commission doesn't even believe what Michael Cohen alleges that Donald Trump did is a crime.
[03:36:30.580 --> 03:36:41.049]  So do not underestimate the hysteria that the mainstream media is able to generate and recognize the necessary backdrop of
[03:36:41.429 --> 03:36:46.373]  For any move to remove the president is to crash this economy.
[03:36:46.854 --> 03:36:54.340]  Well, the chairman of the Federal Reserve is doing his very best to do that, yet today's job numbers were really extraordinary.
[03:36:54.780 --> 03:36:57.803]  Unemployment at the lowest point in American history.
[03:36:58.183 --> 03:37:01.266]  A record number of jobs created in this quarter.
[03:37:01.746 --> 03:37:04.969]  African-American unemployment at the lowest point ever.
[03:37:05.790 --> 03:37:08.412]  This was not in the globalists' plan.
[03:37:09.312 --> 03:37:11.453]  Do not take impeachment lightly.
[03:37:11.914 --> 03:37:13.454]  They are going to try it.
[03:37:13.674 --> 03:37:14.855]  Mark my words.
[03:37:15.235 --> 03:37:16.656]  Thank you for your call.
[03:37:16.936 --> 03:37:21.879]  Let's go to Theodore in my home state of Florida, the Sunshine State.
[03:37:21.919 --> 03:37:23.359]  Theodore, what's on your mind?
[03:37:23.379 --> 03:37:29.482]  You there, Roger?
[03:37:30.023 --> 03:37:31.083]  Yes, Theodore, you with us?
[03:37:32.284 --> 03:37:33.084]  Yeah, I'm here, Roger.
[03:37:33.805 --> 03:37:34.445]  All right, shoot.
[03:37:35.791 --> 03:37:36.632]  Hey, Roger.
[03:37:37.012 --> 03:37:38.273]  I actually wrote a song for you.
[03:37:38.293 --> 03:37:43.497]  I was supposed to meet you December 18th in here in Clearwater, but you weren't feeling well.
[03:37:44.538 --> 03:37:48.361]  So anyways, I wrote a song for you.
[03:37:48.421 --> 03:37:54.185]  It's called A Stone Cold Truth, and it's on my website if you want to listen to it.
[03:37:56.327 --> 03:38:04.193]  The website address is hollywoodblacklist.com, and black is spelled B-L-A-K.
[03:38:05.017 --> 03:38:07.578]  Hollywoodblacklist.com, and it's on the first page.
[03:38:07.638 --> 03:38:08.979]  It's called The Stone Cold Truth.
[03:38:10.079 --> 03:38:15.301]  And I'm a constitutional conservative goth metal artist.
[03:38:15.822 --> 03:38:24.085]  And so basically, I've been writing songs lately about these deep state and far leftist nut jobs.
[03:38:24.765 --> 03:38:29.787]  I feel like that I'm not the only person that's like this.
[03:38:30.148 --> 03:38:33.469]  And quite frankly, I'm sick and tired of Alex Jones and
[03:38:34.306 --> 03:38:41.598]  You, Roger Stone, and other constitutional conservatives being persecuted for no reason.
[03:38:41.919 --> 03:38:46.467]  And so, you know, I wrote this song for you and I think you'll like it.
[03:38:47.509 --> 03:38:52.676]  Well, I am very honored and I am going to reschedule that appearance in Clearwater.
[03:38:53.297 --> 03:38:58.604]  You're right, I did have a doubt of the flu and I very much was disappointed.
[03:38:58.724 --> 03:39:02.950]  It's the first time that I've canceled a public event in many, many years.
[03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:04.052]  I spoke last night
[03:39:04.552 --> 03:39:08.695]  To the Indian River Republican Club just north of Jupiter.
[03:39:09.015 --> 03:39:14.939]  We had a terrific turnout and I want to thank everybody there for their warm hospitality.
[03:39:15.340 --> 03:39:17.881]  Strong, strong support for the President.
[03:39:18.742 --> 03:39:24.626]  I'm still getting over a touch of laryngitis as I think most of you could hear, but I was not going to cancel again.
[03:39:25.166 --> 03:39:26.648]  I am honored by your song.
[03:39:26.688 --> 03:39:29.651]  I'm going to download it and listen to it immediately after the show.
[03:39:30.231 --> 03:39:33.154]  And I will be in touch with you to tell you what I think.
[03:39:33.494 --> 03:39:35.997]  But I'm highly confident that I'm going to like it.
[03:39:36.437 --> 03:39:37.058]  Many thanks.
[03:39:37.138 --> 03:39:40.841]  Let's go to Malcolm in New Mexico.
[03:39:43.084 --> 03:39:44.665]  Roger, it's a great honor to talk to you.
[03:39:45.866 --> 03:39:46.327]  Thank you.
[03:39:46.667 --> 03:39:47.428]  What's on your mind?
[03:39:48.527 --> 03:39:51.089]  Well, just primarily compliments for right now.
[03:39:51.169 --> 03:39:53.170]  First off, I got your Bookstones rules.
[03:39:53.930 --> 03:39:55.171]  I recommend it to everyone.
[03:39:55.651 --> 03:40:02.375]  I particularly like your two rules, which is never be afraid of anyone or anything, and miracles do happen.
[03:40:02.395 --> 03:40:06.858]  I think the miracles happen should come after, though, the never be afraid of anyone or anything.
[03:40:06.878 --> 03:40:11.981]  I did do your Dixon Martini, and I liked it very much.
[03:40:12.982 --> 03:40:16.424]  My only difference is I put cashews in the tomatoes or the olives.
[03:40:16.524 --> 03:40:18.105]  It still came out very wonderful.
[03:40:19.242 --> 03:40:22.983]  And finally, I'm a registered nurse here in Santa Fe.
[03:40:23.103 --> 03:40:26.665]  I work at one of the most intense Catholic charity hospitals in the United States.
[03:40:26.925 --> 03:40:30.886]  I could not survive working there if it were not for the products from InfoWars.
[03:40:32.127 --> 03:40:33.107]  I don't know how I survived.
[03:40:33.267 --> 03:40:39.329]  I had to work Christmas and New Year's, had to charge one floor one of the days.
[03:40:39.389 --> 03:40:41.550]  It was an absolute, we had a winter storm.
[03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:42.670]  It was absolute hell here.
[03:40:43.451 --> 03:40:44.551]  I would not have survived.
[03:40:44.571 --> 03:40:46.752]  I will say this, I will not have survived
[03:40:47.392 --> 03:40:50.093]  Working that, if it were not for InfoWars products, and I mean that.
[03:40:51.594 --> 03:40:59.078]  Well, I know exactly what you mean, because without BrainForce+, this very broadcast would literally be impossible.
[03:40:59.578 --> 03:41:01.098]  So, let me say a couple things.
[03:41:01.139 --> 03:41:12.464]  First of all, never be afraid of anybody or anything is a rule that I lifted from the chairman of the board himself, none other than Frank Sinatra, and it is a rule to live by.
[03:41:13.064 --> 03:41:14.325]  Miracles do happen.
[03:41:14.365 --> 03:41:20.769]  That happened last November of 2016, when this country was veering off into a ditch.
[03:41:20.849 --> 03:41:31.577]  We were heading to a globalist America, and an improbable billionaire from New York, who no one thought could win, stepped forward and decided to save his country.
[03:41:32.217 --> 03:41:35.078]  Donald Trump did not run for president to be somebody.
[03:41:35.098 --> 03:41:36.579]  He already was somebody.
[03:41:36.919 --> 03:41:40.160]  He ran for president to do something, and he is doing it.
[03:41:40.561 --> 03:41:46.123]  And now the globalists are in overdrive in their efforts to destroy him and remove him.
[03:41:46.463 --> 03:41:52.085]  Thank you so much for your call, and I'm glad you enjoyed Dick Nixon's Silver Bullet.
[03:41:52.305 --> 03:42:00.949]  It is, as you know, a martini recipe handed down to our 37th president by none other than Winston Churchill himself.
[03:42:01.589 --> 03:42:07.371]  You can get your copy of Stone's Rules by going to the InfoWars.com store now.
[03:42:07.771 --> 03:42:13.233]  And in the next segment, we'll show you a special address where you can buy your copy, mail it to me.
[03:42:13.854 --> 03:42:17.715]  I will personalize it and sign it and mail it back to you at my own expense.
[03:42:18.155 --> 03:42:21.436]  But only if you buy it at the Infowars.com store.
[03:42:21.996 --> 03:42:22.976]  I'm Roger Stone.
[03:42:23.116 --> 03:42:25.137]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:25.477 --> 03:42:34.158]  This is the most talked about, the most censored, the most vilified and most honest show you'll find on the internet or on radio.
[03:42:34.498 --> 03:42:42.760]  We bring you the Stone Cold Truth every week and it is driving the globalists and the liberals and the communists crazy.
[03:42:43.200 --> 03:42:46.221]  I'll be right back to drive them even crazier.
[03:42:48.297 --> 03:42:52.424]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:42:53.165 --> 03:42:54.647]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:43:09.431 --> 03:43:11.153]  Let's go to Wildman in Illinois.
[03:43:11.193 --> 03:43:13.516]  Thanks for holding, and not to say Happy New Year.
[03:43:13.536 --> 03:43:13.816]  Go ahead.
[03:43:14.137 --> 03:43:23.629]  Alex, yeah, going into 2019, what Trump's got to do to save America, he's got to declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[03:43:23.689 --> 03:43:24.830]  That's how he saves America.
[03:43:24.910 --> 03:43:28.615]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hardworking, honest man, that's what I believe.
[03:43:28.835 --> 03:43:29.175]  I agree.
[03:43:29.255 --> 03:43:29.996]  Victory or death.
[03:43:30.056 --> 03:43:31.716]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[03:43:32.057 --> 03:43:33.537]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[03:43:34.097 --> 03:43:36.639]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[03:43:37.019 --> 03:43:39.300]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[03:43:39.320 --> 03:43:41.021]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[03:43:41.081 --> 03:43:41.621]  It's already begun.
[03:43:41.641 --> 03:43:43.722]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[03:43:44.222 --> 03:43:49.544]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[03:43:49.905 --> 03:43:50.525]  So just get ready.
[03:43:50.825 --> 03:43:51.285]  I'd say.
[03:43:51.365 --> 03:43:54.968]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[03:43:55.168 --> 03:43:57.630]  I'm a loyal supporter, and thanks for great products.
[03:43:57.810 --> 03:43:58.830]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[03:43:58.910 --> 03:44:00.111]  I want to thank you.
[03:44:00.752 --> 03:44:07.596]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[03:44:08.297 --> 03:44:09.718]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[03:44:10.838 --> 03:44:11.899]  They're taking everybody.
[03:44:11.939 --> 03:44:13.720]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[03:44:13.760 --> 03:44:16.882]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[03:44:16.922 --> 03:44:18.744]  That's why this is a war.
[03:44:19.344 --> 03:44:20.845]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[03:44:21.086 --> 03:44:22.387]  Which products do you like the best?
[03:44:22.527 --> 03:44:24.108]  Man, I use the bodies.
[03:44:24.188 --> 03:44:25.449]  I got so many t-shirts.
[03:44:25.489 --> 03:44:26.510]  It ain't even funny.
[03:44:26.550 --> 03:44:31.194]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, my truck.
[03:44:31.614 --> 03:44:35.197]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[03:44:35.498 --> 03:44:36.639]  I spread the word about you.
[03:44:36.799 --> 03:44:39.921]  I wear your clothes, your hat, your shirts, you name it.
[03:44:40.542 --> 03:44:41.703]  Multitude of products.
[03:44:42.043 --> 03:44:45.649]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[03:44:45.709 --> 03:44:52.579]  Um, you know, it's uh, people skeptical, but like it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 your way.
[03:44:52.639 --> 03:44:55.424]  I just, I guess so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[03:45:06.901 --> 03:45:10.183]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[03:45:10.484 --> 03:45:15.367]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[03:45:15.567 --> 03:45:17.288]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[03:45:17.388 --> 03:45:21.091]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[03:45:21.231 --> 03:45:23.252]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[03:45:23.312 --> 03:45:34.360]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[03:45:34.700 --> 03:45:37.341]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[03:45:37.461 --> 03:45:38.561]  How about physical wealth?
[03:45:38.902 --> 03:45:40.942]  When I forget to pick my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[03:45:41.462 --> 03:45:42.523]  We have Edge II.
[03:45:42.603 --> 03:45:47.865]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it to 12,000 feet.
[03:45:48.325 --> 03:45:49.845]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[03:45:50.025 --> 03:45:57.568]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize in this other form of iodine.
[03:45:57.748 --> 03:45:57.888]  Yeah.
[03:46:15.026 --> 03:46:17.387]  Raising the world's IQ, the secret is salt.
[03:46:17.467 --> 03:46:17.927]  But it's not.
[03:46:17.967 --> 03:46:21.108]  It says right here, adding ionized iodine to the salt.
[03:46:21.168 --> 03:46:24.069]  Boosted IQ, 10 to 20 points, increased fertility.
[03:46:24.169 --> 03:46:27.511]  They put it in the water the kids are given at school in China.
[03:46:27.851 --> 03:46:28.691]  Why do I say that?
[03:46:28.831 --> 03:46:42.036]  Because in the 20s, we had major reproductive problems, major deformities, major retardation, major IQ reduction, not on the coastal areas where people got fresh fish that had some iodine in it, but in the Midwest.
[03:46:42.336 --> 03:46:47.759]  You fund us, and you get atomic iodine with the other two types of iodine, so it's fully absorbable.
[03:46:47.860 --> 03:46:50.221]  That's why we have Survival Shield X3.
[03:46:50.341 --> 03:46:52.843]  I could keep selling X2 till the cows come home, and it's there.
[03:46:52.963 --> 03:46:54.283]  But this, this is the best.
[03:46:54.304 --> 03:46:56.585]  X3, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarswife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[03:46:56.605 --> 03:46:58.266]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:34.093 --> 03:47:39.877]  Evidently it's flashback Friday in the control room when we bring back a little disco for you there.
[03:47:40.737 --> 03:47:42.318]  We're going to go back to the phone lines.
[03:47:42.378 --> 03:47:49.963]  You're here at InfoWars, it's the Alex Jones Show, and we're standing up to the satanic pedophile army, and we need your help to do it.
[03:47:50.083 --> 03:47:57.428]  So please, remember to go to the InfoWars.com site now to go to the store and buy one of our terrific products.
[03:47:57.928 --> 03:48:00.871]  We are completely listener and viewer supported.
[03:48:01.211 --> 03:48:08.957]  There are no wealthy conservative fat cats standing in the wings writing giant checks to subsidize what we do here at InfoWars.
[03:48:09.278 --> 03:48:14.222]  We rely completely and totally on you for us to continue to thrive.
[03:48:14.462 --> 03:48:14.702]  Thank you.
[03:48:31.946 --> 03:48:38.089]  Please know that your loyal patronage is what keeps us not only afloat, but moving forward.
[03:48:38.369 --> 03:48:39.890]  Let's go back to the phones.
[03:48:39.930 --> 03:48:42.211]  How about John in Wyoming?
[03:48:42.291 --> 03:48:44.572]  John, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:48:44.812 --> 03:48:45.953]  What's on your mind?
[03:48:46.713 --> 03:48:48.894]  Roger, it's great to talk to you again, sir.
[03:48:49.535 --> 03:48:53.357]  I want to refer back to Barry Goldwater's wonderful 1979 book, With No Apologies.
[03:48:56.704 --> 03:49:03.907]  Not to be confused with that plagiarized title of No Apologies that Mitt Romney came out with a few years ago.
[03:49:04.527 --> 03:49:09.789]  This is With No Apologies by Barry Goldwater, Senator Barry Goldwater from 1979.
[03:49:11.450 --> 03:49:25.955]  And on the first page of Chapter 21, this is page 182, Goldwater named the four CFR, he didn't mention that they were CFR, but in fact they were, the four CFR Republicans who sold him out
[03:49:26.701 --> 03:49:41.890]  In the 1964 presidential campaign, they included Nelson Rockefeller, New York, William Scranton of Pennsylvania, Henry Cabot Lodge, and none other than George Romney of Michigan, Mitt Romney's father.
[03:49:42.490 --> 03:49:53.597]  He was a Judas who sold out Barry Goldwater's 64 presidential campaign and now 55 years later, his son, also a Judas,
[03:49:54.068 --> 03:49:58.171]  Mitt Romney is trying to sell out President Trump's administration.
[03:49:58.852 --> 03:50:03.255]  Now, Mitt Romney, during the Vietnam War, did he serve?
[03:50:03.435 --> 03:50:03.755]  No.
[03:50:03.775 --> 03:50:08.899]  Did his five sons serve in any branch of the armed forces?
[03:50:09.159 --> 03:50:09.459]  No.
[03:50:09.939 --> 03:50:17.465]  You see, Mitt Romney went to Paris and stayed in Paris during the Vietnam War as a Mormon missionary.
[03:50:18.010 --> 03:50:22.872]  Never mind that France has been a Catholic country for some 2,000 years.
[03:50:23.472 --> 03:50:27.614]  He thought that they needed his Mormon spiritual advice.
[03:50:28.554 --> 03:50:43.120]  So he got out of all military service, even non-combatant military service, during the Vietnam War by acting as a Mormon missionary going to France to supposedly civilize the masses.
[03:50:43.780 --> 03:50:45.781]  Now, this isn't the same Mitt Romney.
[03:50:46.420 --> 03:51:05.768]  Who told it during the 2012 presidential campaign, who told a middle-aged couple from New Hampshire that his five sons, Romney's five sons, working on his presidential campaign, were just as patriotic as their son serving in Afghanistan.
[03:51:06.368 --> 03:51:09.529]  I would have, had I been there, I would have spit in his face.
[03:51:10.129 --> 03:51:11.870]  He is that much of a sleaze.
[03:51:12.637 --> 03:51:29.343]  And now, as soon as he gets elected, even before he was sworn in the other day, he was trashing President Trump and bad-mouthing President Trump, despite receiving an endorsement for his campaign, which helped him get elected.
[03:51:30.083 --> 03:51:36.126]  So Mitt Romney is nothing but a liar and a sleaze and a coward.
[03:51:36.806 --> 03:51:39.207]  As a matter of fact, when he was speaking during the
[03:51:40.151 --> 03:52:05.165]  A campaign in 2012 that when he would insult a couple whose son was risking his life in Afghanistan and tell them that his five sons serving on his presidential campaign were just as patriotic as their son serving in Afghanistan, that man should not have been elected to anything.
[03:52:05.245 --> 03:52:08.247]  The only time that I would ever vote for Mitt Romney
[03:52:08.817 --> 03:52:17.149]  is if he ran for ambassador to Somalia and I guarantee you I would vote for him gladly in that position.
[03:52:17.961 --> 03:52:19.962]  So I get your drift.
[03:52:19.982 --> 03:52:21.123]  You know, it's very interesting.
[03:52:21.163 --> 03:52:31.488]  People don't realize that George Romney, much like his son, was not a Republican right up until the time that he switched to become a Republican and run for governor of Michigan.
[03:52:31.908 --> 03:52:35.069]  He refused to go to the Republican state headquarters.
[03:52:35.650 --> 03:52:39.892]  He refused to have Romney material available in the state headquarters.
[03:52:39.952 --> 03:52:44.194]  And as you correctly point out, he knifed Barry Goldwater in the back.
[03:52:44.654 --> 03:52:50.163]  Similarly, Mitt Romney was not a Republican until he decided to run for the U.S.
[03:52:50.183 --> 03:52:52.627]  Senate against Senator Ted Kennedy.
[03:52:52.667 --> 03:52:53.728]  And here's the great point.
[03:52:54.109 --> 03:52:56.032]  He ran to Ted Kennedy's left.
[03:52:56.730 --> 03:53:05.816]  Mitt Romney supported gay marriage, for example, prior to Ted Kennedy, who was long an opponent of it in an overwhelmingly Catholic state.
[03:53:06.277 --> 03:53:08.218]  Mitt Romney is not a conservative.
[03:53:08.298 --> 03:53:10.080]  Mitt Romney is not a Republican.
[03:53:10.140 --> 03:53:17.545]  Mitt Romney is a corporate capitalist who keeps changing the color and style of his hair, but believes in absolutely nothing.
[03:53:17.905 --> 03:53:21.948]  And what really drives him crazy is Donald Trump carried Michigan.
[03:53:22.546 --> 03:53:23.607]  But Mitt Romney didn't.
[03:53:23.887 --> 03:53:25.649]  Donald Trump carried Wisconsin.
[03:53:25.949 --> 03:53:27.110]  But Mitt Romney didn't.
[03:53:27.531 --> 03:53:29.292]  Donald Trump carried Pennsylvania.
[03:53:29.492 --> 03:53:30.653]  But Mitt Romney didn't.
[03:53:31.054 --> 03:53:32.655]  Donald Trump carried Ohio.
[03:53:32.915 --> 03:53:34.116]  But Mitt Romney didn't.
[03:53:34.437 --> 03:53:36.078]  Donald Trump carried Florida.
[03:53:36.298 --> 03:53:37.559]  But Mitt Romney didn't.
[03:53:37.920 --> 03:53:40.302]  So Mitt and Stuart Stevens, try it.
[03:53:40.402 --> 03:53:41.063]  Give it a shot.
[03:53:41.163 --> 03:53:42.344]  Come back one more time.
[03:53:42.664 --> 03:53:44.546]  You will get decimated yet again.
[03:53:45.146 --> 03:53:47.687]  The reason I knew that this was a setup was obvious.
[03:53:47.788 --> 03:53:50.689]  Mitt Romney's been an executive in everything he's ever done.
[03:53:51.129 --> 03:53:52.690]  Why would he want to go to the U.S.
[03:53:52.750 --> 03:53:59.093]  Senate to be a junior member of a body of 100 where his influence is absolutely zero?
[03:53:59.474 --> 03:54:03.716]  And why does he want to represent a state that he doesn't even live in?
[03:54:04.296 --> 03:54:04.736]  Utah.
[03:54:04.956 --> 03:54:07.598]  Because Mitt Romney lives in Massachusetts.
[03:54:08.118 --> 03:54:08.918]  He's a fraud.
[03:54:09.158 --> 03:54:10.499]  He's an obvious fraud.
[03:54:10.839 --> 03:54:12.960]  And his treachery was so predictable.
[03:54:13.280 --> 03:54:19.302]  So I'd like to know, who in the Trump White House urged Donald Trump to endorse him in the primary?
[03:54:19.682 --> 03:54:21.163]  Because I saw the polling.
[03:54:21.223 --> 03:54:24.824]  Mitt Romney could have been defeated by one simple move.
[03:54:24.884 --> 03:54:25.404]  Here it is.
[03:54:25.964 --> 03:54:27.185]  Mitt, you want to be our U.S.
[03:54:27.225 --> 03:54:27.585]  Senator?
[03:54:27.925 --> 03:54:33.347]  Pledge right now that you'll fill out the entire six-year term and you will not run for president.
[03:54:33.908 --> 03:54:34.949]  Go ahead, say it.
[03:54:35.389 --> 03:54:36.110]  And he wouldn't have.
[03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:46.838]  But unfortunately, and I don't know whether this was Jared Kushner or the White House political operation, suggested that the president might make peace with Romney by endorsing him for the Senate.
[03:54:47.298 --> 03:54:49.700]  He is indeed Judas Iscariot.
[03:54:49.860 --> 03:54:52.642]  What you expect from a pig, but a grunt.
[03:54:53.003 --> 03:54:55.064]  Thank you so much for your call.
[03:54:55.344 --> 03:54:57.446]  Let's go to Michael in Canada.
[03:54:57.746 --> 03:54:58.507]  Michael, you with us?
[03:54:58.547 --> 03:54:59.968]  We got about three minutes here.
[03:55:01.252 --> 03:55:02.213]  Yes, I'm here, Roger.
[03:55:02.233 --> 03:55:03.194]  Good to talk to you again.
[03:55:04.074 --> 03:55:07.817]  That was a very good insight on Mittens-Romney.
[03:55:08.157 --> 03:55:09.338]  He's just nothing but a sellout.
[03:55:10.219 --> 03:55:13.962]  But I'd like to talk to you briefly about the previous topic.
[03:55:14.022 --> 03:55:18.665]  I spoke with you, and it's the only way I see the special counsel being ended.
[03:55:19.866 --> 03:55:29.934]  And that would involve President Trump making an executive secret decision to send some heavy-hitting operators under the cover of night
[03:55:30.905 --> 03:55:37.108]  To go to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and extract Julian Assange.
[03:55:38.849 --> 03:55:49.594]  Once he is in front of the special counsel and he tells in secret who the emails came from, from the DNC, I think it's over.
[03:55:50.675 --> 03:55:53.316]  I think he is the key maker to everything.
[03:55:55.655 --> 03:55:57.376]  Well, it's an intriguing idea.
[03:55:57.616 --> 03:56:02.717]  Look, I am on record as saying that I think Julian Assange is a heroic journalist.
[03:56:02.817 --> 03:56:07.178]  I think that he does the same thing that the New York Times and the Washington Post do.
[03:56:07.238 --> 03:56:12.280]  He gets a cold of classified information or information that's embarrassing to the government.
[03:56:12.660 --> 03:56:15.741]  He verifies its authenticity and he publishes it.
[03:56:16.181 --> 03:56:20.562]  His problem is that he has embarrassed the deep state time and time again.
[03:56:21.162 --> 03:56:31.170]  In the 11 years that WikiLeaks has been in operation, nothing Julian Assange has ever published has been questioned in terms of its accuracy or its authenticity.
[03:56:31.750 --> 03:56:34.372]  Can the New York Times or the Washington Post say that?
[03:56:34.873 --> 03:56:35.013]  No.
[03:56:36.049 --> 03:56:40.932]  Now, we are being told over and over again that he is an asset for the Russians.
[03:56:41.332 --> 03:56:43.413]  That is unproven at best.
[03:56:44.053 --> 03:56:46.915]  I'm being sued by the Democratic National Committee.
[03:56:46.955 --> 03:56:50.417]  It's one of the things that is bankrupting me and my family.
[03:56:50.817 --> 03:57:03.904]  And I am the only plaintiff in the lawsuit who has told the DNC to preserve the servers in discovery so that my technical experts can examine them and we can determine whether the DNC was ever hacked at all.
[03:57:04.284 --> 03:57:06.165]  Your idea is an intriguing one.
[03:57:06.205 --> 03:57:11.427]  The problem with it is, of course, it would violate Julian Assange's journalistic ethics.
[03:57:11.807 --> 03:57:14.188]  Journalists do not reveal their sources.
[03:57:14.648 --> 03:57:24.813]  When he posted a reward for Seth Rich, when he said people who are our sources take their lives into their hands, I don't think he could have made it any clearer
[03:57:25.553 --> 03:57:28.914]  Uh, who his source was, without blurting out the name.
[03:57:29.235 --> 03:57:31.596]  Thank you very much for your insightful call.
[03:57:32.116 --> 03:57:35.977]  Uh, I'm Roger Stone, you've joined us on the Alex Jones Show.
