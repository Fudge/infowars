[00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:16.210]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.391]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.072]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:21.294]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.675]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:27.899]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:40.357]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a world exclusive.
[00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:57.601]  Infowars.com reporter, patriot, former chief advisor to Donald Trump, Roger Stone, was SWAT team raided in a disgusting act of police state theater by the now politicized arm of the deep state, the FBI.
[00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:06.930]  In a pre-dawn raid that CNN, of course, had been tipped off to, with a reporter lying on TV like a Cheshire Cat saying that he hadn't been.
[00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.535]  Well, Roger Stone last night predicted to me, he said, I think they're coming for me tomorrow.
[00:01:12.136 --> 00:01:16.000]  He said, I can just feel it, I can see it, all the preparation, everything.
[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.522]  And he sent me a text message saying,
[00:01:18.122 --> 00:01:21.363]  Alex, I can say I've had greater, better moments, better mornings, shall we say.
[00:01:46.164 --> 00:01:49.847]  Where should we start with how you were able to predict this last night over the phone?
[00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:51.048]  What happened this morning?
[00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:53.310]  What happened once they got into your house?
[00:01:54.191 --> 00:01:56.013]  And then what happened once you were in jail?
[00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:57.414]  And then what unfolded after that?
[00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:11.846]  Well, the important thing, I think, off the bat is that after a two-year investigation, none of these charges relate to Russian collusion or WikiLeaks collaboration or any other illegal act connected to the 2016 election.
[00:02:16.657 --> 00:02:24.282]  I'm leaving the Congress in my testimony on matters that are immaterial and in which there is no intent.
[00:02:24.702 --> 00:02:31.287]  Any error I did make would have been inconsequential and would have been inadvertent.
[00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:35.790]  Secondarily, there are false charges of witness intimidation.
[00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.116]  This is a politically motivated result, and what's particularly galling is the fact that
[00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:51.500]  The special counsel put out a press release prior to notifying my attorneys that I would be charged.
[00:02:52.761 --> 00:03:00.523]  And this morning, completely unnecessarily, 29 FBI.
[00:03:02.323 --> 00:03:04.524]  Roger, you're obviously getting a lot of calls on that phone.
[00:03:04.564 --> 00:03:05.124]  It's breaking up.
[00:03:05.164 --> 00:03:05.524]  Start over.
[00:03:05.544 --> 00:03:07.324]  You're saying 29 FBI?
[00:03:10.845 --> 00:03:13.986]  They terrorized not only my wife, but my dogs.
[00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:17.773]  Please describe what happened because your phone's been ringing up.
[00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:22.236]  Repeat, you said 29?
[00:03:22.276 --> 00:03:26.999]  29 FBI agents showed up at my home, pounded on the door.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.543]  I opened the door to, you know, pointed automatic weapons.
[00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:34.464]  I was handcuffed.
[00:03:35.264 --> 00:03:39.587]  There were, I don't know, 17 vehicles in the street with their lights on.
[00:03:40.757 --> 00:03:43.120]  They terrorized my wife and my dogs.
[00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:48.088]  They executed a search warrant to search the premises.
[00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.619]  And CNN was present, so clearly CNN was tipped off prior to my arrest.
[00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.565]  Unbelievable world exclusive, Roger.
[00:03:58.585 --> 00:04:01.928]  We're going to go to break in a moment and come back and let you walk through what happened after that.
[00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:12.938]  But the idea of 29 armed men in a pre-dawn raid, these are the same Democratic Party-run FBI that say that MS-13 are God's children and none of them should be checked coming across the border.
[00:04:12.978 --> 00:04:19.304]  But you, a man with no criminal record who's worked for multiple administrations, you get an El Chapo-level raid.
[00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.563]  Well, clearly they could have just contacted my attorneys and I would have voluntarily turned myself in.
[00:04:27.045 --> 00:04:30.969]  I was then taken to the FBI facility where I was fingerprinted.
[00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:34.992]  The FBI was extraordinarily courteous, had no complaints with them.
[00:04:36.193 --> 00:04:38.736]  But, you know, it was unnecessary.
[00:04:38.756 --> 00:04:41.819]  It was meant to intimidate me, but I am not intimidated.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.380]  You know, I
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.504]  I now obviously will be arraigned in D.C.
[00:04:48.544 --> 00:04:49.625]  sometime next week.
[00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:54.230]  And then I intend to vigorously fight the charges because they are false.
[00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.731]  Roger, stay right there.
[00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:57.173]  Back in 60 seconds.
[00:04:57.313 --> 00:04:59.255]  This is the time for listeners to spread the word.
[00:04:59.295 --> 00:04:59.876]  Everyone they know.
[00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:01.037]  World exclusive.
[00:05:01.057 --> 00:05:01.978]  Let this man speak.
[00:05:05.512 --> 00:05:08.833]  Now you've stayed vigilant, you've been pushing the site, and you've been helping us get it out there.
[00:05:08.913 --> 00:05:12.455]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[00:05:12.655 --> 00:05:16.837]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show, get that link out to everybody.
[00:05:16.957 --> 00:05:22.739]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil and krill oil, the highest quality.
[00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:23.419]  We're good to go.
[00:05:47.404 --> 00:05:54.908]  TurboForce is the ultimate vitamin mineral, total energy, fusion, next level, total mega package, nothing else is even near it.
[00:05:55.049 --> 00:06:00.812]  Get TurboForce today at InfoWarsLive.com, but I recommend you only take half a dose the first time.
[00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:02.793]  Beware the power of TurboForce!
[00:06:06.815 --> 00:06:08.937]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:09.437 --> 00:06:14.580]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:25.018 --> 00:06:35.185]  Ladies and gentlemen, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of reporters are queued up in Florida outside the courthouse trying to get an interview with Roger Stone.
[00:06:35.925 --> 00:06:43.510]  Well, he's here exclusively, global exclusive, and he's going to make them wait while literally hundreds and hundreds more pile up.
[00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.152]  One of the biggest press conferences in history, pre-dawn raid, 29 armed
[00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:51.435]  Paramilitary pointing guns at him and his wife, his dogs.
[00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:53.136]  He peacefully came to the door.
[00:06:53.616 --> 00:06:55.638]  He told me last night he thought they were coming in for the kill.
[00:06:55.938 --> 00:06:57.058]  I've released that text message.
[00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:58.419]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.661]  You're going to get to hear from him now in this segment and the next.
[00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.843]  And then he'll go out and face the circling sharks.
[00:07:04.643 --> 00:07:10.107]  But Roger, because your phone was breaking up earlier, repeat what happened again because it was clear during the break.
[00:07:10.387 --> 00:07:10.667]  Sure.
[00:07:10.687 --> 00:07:12.668]  At approximately the crack of dawn around just before 6 a.m.
[00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:44.317]  29 FBI agents with 17 vehicles with all of their lights flashing, pounded on the door, woke my wife and I up.
[00:07:45.537 --> 00:07:46.578]  I came to the door.
[00:07:46.758 --> 00:07:49.639]  They were pointing weapons at me, demanding that I open the door.
[00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:50.939]  The door has a window.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.560]  I did.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.661]  They took me outside where I was handcuffed.
[00:07:56.054 --> 00:07:58.555]  And then they went upstairs to find my wife.
[00:07:58.856 --> 00:08:01.357]  They scared the daylights out of her and the dogs.
[00:08:02.298 --> 00:08:04.460]  They asked me if I had any weapons in the home.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.220]  I do not.
[00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:18.570]  They allowed me to dress, and then I was taken to the FBI processing facility in Miami-Dade County, where I was fingerprinted.
[00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:24.214]  And the FBI was exceedingly courteous, I want to say, and they treated me very well.
[00:08:26.379 --> 00:08:36.702]  Then I was taken from there to the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, where I had to go to a bond hearing wearing shackles, hands and feet.
[00:08:38.922 --> 00:08:42.823]  No cameras were allowed in the proceeding.
[00:08:43.563 --> 00:08:46.384]  A representative from the Special Counsel's Office and the U.S.
[00:08:46.444 --> 00:08:50.825]  Attorney's Office and my attorneys jointly agreed to a $250,000 bond for which I will be released.
[00:08:56.303 --> 00:09:03.646]  I had to wait for, you know, in a cell, a holding cell for processing, and I have now just come out.
[00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:15.992]  It is, as you know, Alex, they have attempted to destroy me financially prior to this so that I, hopefully, they would like me to plead guilty to charges that are completely bogus.
[00:09:17.472 --> 00:09:21.594]  You know, there's no Russian collusion, there's no WikiLeaks collaboration, there's no
[00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:27.417]  Allegation that I received anything from WikiLeaks, or Julian Assange, or anyone else.
[00:09:28.997 --> 00:09:37.360]  And... Well, it's down to alleged false statements to the Congress.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.500]  And I contest all of them.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.382]  And in my testimony would be honest mistakes of memory, and they would be immaterial.
[00:09:46.442 --> 00:09:48.443]  They would be inconsequential.
[00:09:49.727 --> 00:09:54.171]  So, you know, it's a political, I think it's a politically motivated word.
[00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:56.534]  Well, Roger.
[00:09:57.882 --> 00:10:13.089]  I've talked to a lot of national members of the press today who are just flabbergasted right now because they've read the indictment and you have Randy Credico saying he was talking to Assange and that he was the go-between.
[00:10:13.109 --> 00:10:18.851]  I remember back at the time, this being discussed, you said you knew a talk show host that knew lawyers from WikiLeaks.
[00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:20.952]  Everybody was trying to talk to WikiLeaks.
[00:10:21.372 --> 00:10:22.733]  So again, we've talked about this a million times.
[00:10:23.173 --> 00:10:25.014]  This is making journalism
[00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:26.372]  Illegal.
[00:10:27.032 --> 00:10:30.976]  And if the press doesn't circle the wagons and see how dangerous this is, it's insane.
[00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:36.221]  And now, as you know, I've got Washington Times, Washington Post, AP, all these reports about...
[00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:43.011]  Witness and special counsel probe, former Stone Associate, collected payments from InfoWars through JobStoneArrange.
[00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:47.054]  I have my phone ringing off the hook saying, did you make the hush money?
[00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:48.256]  Are you going to prison?
[00:10:48.536 --> 00:10:59.606]  So now employing people and then giving them a severance pay that's in their contract, because that's what he wanted to work here, he made a pretty good deal for himself, but I had to let him go because I didn't like his writing anymore, it just wasn't accurate.
[00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:02.948]  Of course he now admits, okay, it was severance pay.
[00:11:03.528 --> 00:11:05.308]  Earlier he was saying, actually, it was something else.
[00:11:05.348 --> 00:11:07.549]  But the point is, they're now moving on to me and my father.
[00:11:07.869 --> 00:11:11.689]  And my spidey sense tells me they mean to move on us to take Infowars out.
[00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:18.411]  And to take any support for the President out, because they know we got President Trump elected.
[00:11:20.451 --> 00:11:21.111]  You're right.
[00:11:21.131 --> 00:11:23.392]  No, Alex, look, you're absolutely right.
[00:11:26.063 --> 00:11:27.965]  It's an absurdity.
[00:11:27.985 --> 00:11:30.648]  They've tried to hurt my position there at InfoWars.
[00:11:30.688 --> 00:11:35.853]  They've made false allegations regarding your compensation to Jerry Corsi.
[00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:41.218]  Yet none of that is reflected in the charges brought today.
[00:11:41.238 --> 00:11:44.401]  These charges are thin, to say the least.
[00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:46.642]  But they seek to destroy me.
[00:11:46.822 --> 00:11:50.064]  I need people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com now.
[00:11:50.204 --> 00:11:58.169]  I really need people's help, because I'm going to be facing a trial in the District of Columbia, and I intend to fight for my life.
[00:11:58.389 --> 00:12:01.811]  There's no circumstance under which I would plead guilty to these charges.
[00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:06.074]  There's no circumstance in which I would bear false witness against the president.
[00:12:06.634 --> 00:12:07.735]  I'm just not going to do that.
[00:12:08.993 --> 00:12:18.695]  Roger, I want to get into some news with you here and then we'll go to break, come back for a few minutes and then we'll go to that huge press conference, but most of them are the enemy and they're going to try to edit things out of context.
[00:12:18.715 --> 00:12:22.717]  So this is really your chance to have long form talk about the reality of what's unfolded here.
[00:12:22.777 --> 00:12:27.978]  But the president a few months ago said you have a lot of courage and it's good to hear that you won't lie for them.
[00:12:29.058 --> 00:12:34.920]  He also has pointed out this is the greatest witch hunt in history and of course there's no Russia collusion, no Russia nothing.
[00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.562]  They're saying that you lied to Congress that you didn't directly talk to Assange.
[00:12:40.142 --> 00:12:43.884]  Well I mean this is just the most insane crap ever and
[00:12:45.204 --> 00:12:46.285]  This is all they've got.
[00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.666]  It's just crazy, and it never seems to end.
[00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.887]  So, what does the President need to do?
[00:12:51.227 --> 00:12:54.068]  Mueller is this power to himself on tarmacs with uranium.
[00:12:54.668 --> 00:12:58.050]  Uranium One, the Clintons, billions of dollars, hundreds of millions for the uranium.
[00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.631]  They're all on these boards with Russian companies.
[00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:01.271]  Mueller is.
[00:13:01.731 --> 00:13:07.894]  And then meanwhile, you have no Russia connection, and you just bonded out for a quarter million dollars and are facing many years in prison.
[00:13:07.914 --> 00:13:09.775]  I mean, this is cartoonish.
[00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:11.575]  This is beyond a witch hunt.
[00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:12.436]  It's an inquisition.
[00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:33.964]  Well, and if people want to know exactly what's going on, if they want to see my full statement, if they want to keep up to date on what's going on, they should keep focused on InfoWars, because we will bring the whole story, the whole truth, unlike CNN and some of the censored, or I should say controlled, corporate media.
[00:13:35.583 --> 00:13:38.064]  Roger, there's a lot of points to make here in the limited time we have.
[00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:41.606]  What do you expect to come next in the wet shunt?
[00:13:41.626 --> 00:13:44.207]  You've been pretty accurate at guessing who's coming next.
[00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:51.011]  It looks like they're expanding the wet shunt, not contracting it, while telling the president that he's not the target when the internal documents show he is the target.
[00:13:52.557 --> 00:13:54.858]  Yeah, I still believe that that is the bottom line.
[00:13:55.418 --> 00:13:58.460]  My attorneys have not yet had conversations with the special counsel.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:03.202]  As you know, prior to my arrest this morning, we had no contact at all.
[00:14:04.943 --> 00:14:06.644]  So we kind of have to wait and see.
[00:14:06.984 --> 00:14:11.066]  I would predict that they want me to bear false witness against the president.
[00:14:11.186 --> 00:14:14.128]  I'm just telling you, that's something I'm not going to be pressured into doing.
[00:14:14.688 --> 00:14:18.730]  As long as I have a breath in my body and a dollar to pay a lawyer, I'm going to fight.
[00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:19.630]  I will fight.
[00:14:19.931 --> 00:14:20.591]  I will not quit.
[00:14:21.414 --> 00:14:22.715]  What is your statement to the President?
[00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:25.456]  He's undoubtedly going to be watching this, or is watching it.
[00:14:25.797 --> 00:14:27.598]  This is TopLinked on DrugsReport.com.
[00:14:28.178 --> 00:14:29.399]  What do you want to say to the President?
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:41.806]  Once again, there is no evidence of Russian collusion, WikiLeaks collaboration, and I'm not charged with doing anything inappropriate or illegal to assist in his election.
[00:14:42.667 --> 00:14:48.070]  Even though I think I'm being persecuted for being a 40-year friend and supporter of his.
[00:14:50.185 --> 00:14:53.468]  Now, Roger, we're told now there's over 500 reporters waiting for you.
[00:14:53.489 --> 00:14:59.635]  Let's let them keep waiting, like the President does, and build this up, because they can't stand your here, unedited, live.
[00:14:59.655 --> 00:15:10.967]  We're going to break, do five more minutes with us on the other side, and I'll let you talk to your lawyers, then get out there to the crowd, and hopefully get a cough drop, because I know you haven't had a lot of sleep, and you're exhausted, and you've been there with the FBI, but you said the FBI were very cordial.
[00:15:11.007 --> 00:15:11.668]  That's the good cop.
[00:15:12.188 --> 00:15:17.032]  The FBI SWAT team that came into the house and pointed guns at you, they terrorized you.
[00:15:17.492 --> 00:15:23.637]  And this has got a lot of law enforcement I know, including federal law enforcement, who are good guys calling me saying they're so disgusted right now.
[00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:32.623]  Look, every attorney I know who has read this indictment and been in touch with my lawyers think it is a joke.
[00:15:32.863 --> 00:15:34.865]  They think it is thin, to say the least.
[00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:45.134]  When we come back, let's specifically get into how you felt terrorized and then let's get into your defense fund because, yes, I know you've had to sell one of your places.
[00:15:45.634 --> 00:15:56.260]  I know for a fact that, because I demanded to see it, that you're out of money and that you're living paycheck to paycheck and trying to hold on to your home, that they've been terrorizing your wife, and so people need to go to your defense fund.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.541]  They need to donate for the First Amendment for America and for us all.
[00:16:00.082 --> 00:16:01.062]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[00:16:08.726 --> 00:16:17.470]  If the deep state and Robert Mueller and his allies now in the Democratic House succeed in destroying me, who will be next?
[00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.911]  You see, I've been targeted because I stood up for America.
[00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:24.953]  Because I stood up for our president and his reform agenda.
[00:16:25.373 --> 00:16:28.154]  And now I have no choice but to appeal to you.
[00:16:29.074 --> 00:16:35.837]  I am very grateful to all those Americans who have stepped forward to help me so far in this extraordinary legal struggle.
[00:16:36.138 --> 00:16:38.639]  But now I need your help as never before.
[00:16:39.099 --> 00:16:41.940]  Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.001]  Help me stand up for America.

[00:20:17.341 --> 00:20:19.526]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:20.027 --> 00:20:25.159]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:30.028]  CNN, Fox News, they're all having conniption fits.
[00:20:30.048 --> 00:20:32.470]  Because they're all part of the deep state at the top.
[00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.331]  And they want to hear Stone's statement.
[00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:36.272]  They want to misrepresent it.
[00:20:36.292 --> 00:20:40.114]  But here he is live, Roger Stone exclusively with us.
[00:20:40.794 --> 00:20:44.636]  Only DrugsReport.com would dare link to actually hear what he has to say.
[00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:46.257]  DrugsReport.com has it top-linked.
[00:20:46.677 --> 00:20:48.158]  Infowars.com has it top-linked.
[00:20:48.178 --> 00:20:52.960]  And you better believe later today, during the war room, you're going to get more exclusives with Roger Stone.
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.241]  But this is the one that counts.
[00:20:54.901 --> 00:21:07.884]  We have the entire corporate media trying to take us off the air, trying to silence us, all these Soros-funded lawsuits, battling to shut down InfoWars, battling to destroy Roger Stone because we got Stone elected.
[00:21:08.324 --> 00:21:09.965]  I mean, we got President Trump elected.
[00:21:10.405 --> 00:21:12.546]  Roger Stone, this operation, our listeners.
[00:21:12.906 --> 00:21:13.646]  And that's a fact.
[00:21:13.666 --> 00:21:21.608]  So we're being destroyed in slow motion and being lynched by the corporate media who claim that they are actually journalists.
[00:21:22.441 --> 00:21:24.283]  Because they're all part of this system.
[00:21:24.303 --> 00:21:28.167]  So, Roger, you have the floor to the real world right now to make the statements.
[00:21:28.187 --> 00:21:29.268]  They're encamped at your house.
[00:21:29.308 --> 00:21:32.511]  The FBI's put a big tarp up so the helicopters can show it.
[00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:36.455]  They're moving in to your home, looking for anything they can.
[00:21:36.515 --> 00:21:37.416]  Obviously, there's nothing.
[00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:38.757]  This is so historic.
[00:21:38.777 --> 00:21:42.721]  So, Roger, world exclusive, your thoughts about what's happening, what's unfolding.
[00:21:48.973 --> 00:21:49.513]  Get him back on.
[00:21:50.254 --> 00:21:51.755]  And his phone has people calling it.
[00:21:51.835 --> 00:21:54.016]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:21:54.797 --> 00:21:56.938]  And I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't break into it and cut it off.
[00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:58.079]  We've had a lot of that go on.
[00:21:58.099 --> 00:22:02.622]  I mean, my phone all the time starts dialing people and going places and doing things.
[00:22:02.682 --> 00:22:03.202]  It's insane.
[00:22:03.222 --> 00:22:05.323]  It's absolutely insane.
[00:22:09.506 --> 00:22:10.847]  Okay, Roger is back.
[00:22:10.887 --> 00:22:11.827]  Roger, your phone dropped.
[00:22:12.288 --> 00:22:14.389]  Roger, the whole world's watching and listening right now.
[00:22:14.649 --> 00:22:17.431]  What do you want to tell the world about what's happening with your fake indictment?
[00:22:18.482 --> 00:22:21.825]  Well, first of all, Alex, you wouldn't believe the scene I'm looking at outside.
[00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:24.507]  There must be five, six hundred reporters out there.
[00:22:25.348 --> 00:22:27.590]  But we're exclusive here at InfoWars.
[00:22:28.374 --> 00:22:48.171]  Um, you know, I predicted for many months that I would be framed on some process charge, that they would find no evidence of Russian collusion or witch leaks collaboration, that they would take things that are clearly activities on my part, which are covered by the First Amendment, and try to criminalize them, in essence criminalizing political activity.
[00:22:48.531 --> 00:22:54.537]  What people need to understand is that I am innocent, that the whole Russian collusion investigation is a
[00:22:54.957 --> 00:22:59.058]  It's a distraction from the real crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas.
[00:23:00.039 --> 00:23:10.082]  But I need people's help more than ever if they want me to fight, and I intend to fight, to clear my name against these politically motivated charges and these politically motivated prosecutors.
[00:23:10.542 --> 00:23:13.363]  I need folks to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:23:14.043 --> 00:23:18.184]  This is going to be, you know, they project my legal costs to be $2 million.
[00:23:19.725 --> 00:23:20.805]  But I intend to fight.
[00:23:21.085 --> 00:23:22.786]  I need every patriot to stand with me.
[00:23:23.973 --> 00:23:25.634]  And Roger, I want to be very clear about this.
[00:23:27.454 --> 00:23:34.937]  BuzzFeed gets $300 million a year and doesn't have the traffic of InfoWars with our combined network.
[00:23:35.518 --> 00:23:40.259]  We sell $40-$50 million a product, but it's literally marked down to half cost.
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.121]  So then that's gross $20 million.
[00:23:44.161 --> 00:23:50.783]  Well, no, gross $40, then when he keeps $20, then you hire all the crew, pay all the services, pay for the bandwidth, do everything.
[00:23:50.843 --> 00:23:54.204]  I'm left with a couple million, and then it literally all goes to lawyers.
[00:23:54.724 --> 00:23:56.324]  And so InfoWars needs to be supported.
[00:23:56.364 --> 00:23:58.665]  Everyone needs to double down and go buy the products.
[00:23:59.245 --> 00:24:05.427]  BuzzFeed gets $300 million pure cash and still loses $100 million a year and just laid off 15%.
[00:24:06.747 --> 00:24:11.131]  They're cutting us off because we're popular, because we tell the truth, because we were growing and expanding.
[00:24:11.191 --> 00:24:12.633]  Now we're to the point of contracting.
[00:24:12.973 --> 00:24:16.597]  So yes, InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, go get products.
[00:24:16.897 --> 00:24:21.822]  And yes, Roger, people need to commit now to go get a t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:24:22.082 --> 00:24:22.763]  We're good to go.
[00:24:42.866 --> 00:24:45.268]  All together now, three million dollars the last two years.
[00:24:45.668 --> 00:24:50.171]  I mean, they are literally destroying us, but the listeners have us in their hands.
[00:24:50.492 --> 00:24:52.073]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:24:52.293 --> 00:25:00.580]  Let's send Mueller and all the rest of them a very strong message that people believe in the press, they believe in America, they wanted people to stand up to Hillary, they wanted people to stand up to the globalists.
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:02.461]  We won fair and square.
[00:25:02.581 --> 00:25:08.626]  They're pissed, and they're sending a message that if populist nationalists try to stand up to the globalists, we will destroy you.
[00:25:08.846 --> 00:25:10.967]  But Roger, as you said, you're not going to be intimidated.
[00:25:10.987 --> 00:25:12.128]  I'm very proud to know you.
[00:25:12.448 --> 00:25:13.389]  I'm honored to know you.
[00:25:13.709 --> 00:25:14.890]  You're fun to talk to every day.
[00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:19.893]  You're a good friend of mine now that I've known you the last, I met you like five years ago, but I've gotten to know you the last three or three and a half.
[00:25:20.454 --> 00:25:23.055]  And it's just an amazing thing that we're in together, my friend.
[00:25:23.476 --> 00:25:30.540]  And so just talk about again, the pre-dawn raid, your wife, what she's going through.
[00:25:31.161 --> 00:25:32.121]  They're moving into your house.
[00:25:32.141 --> 00:25:32.802]  We'll show the footage.
[00:25:32.822 --> 00:25:34.123]  They've got big tarps going up.
[00:25:34.523 --> 00:25:35.804]  I mean, this is just incredible, Roger.
[00:25:43.331 --> 00:25:46.052]  There's no doubt they're going in and dropping the phone.
[00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:48.113]  All these phones are tapped.
[00:25:48.133 --> 00:25:50.714]  I mean, hell, they admit there's taps out on them.
[00:25:50.754 --> 00:25:55.796]  So you better believe they are so pissed right now that we're able to talk to Roger.
[00:25:55.816 --> 00:25:57.497]  They are so upset this is going on.
[00:25:58.889 --> 00:26:00.410]  80% chance they're cutting the feed.
[00:26:01.391 --> 00:26:09.816]  20% chance there's so many reporters and so many digital cell phones and so much stuff out there, now it looks like a thousand reporters, that that can also make things drop.
[00:26:09.836 --> 00:26:13.199]  You ever been in a huge traffic jam and you notice your phone keeps dropping?
[00:26:13.219 --> 00:26:14.700]  Because there's so many people on their phones.
[00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.301]  Did Roger answer?
[00:26:18.242 --> 00:26:19.583]  Keep calling him until you get him.
[00:26:20.799 --> 00:26:25.644]  And we'll obviously have Roger as this unfolds throughout the day, but you can hear that his voice is almost gone.
[00:26:25.664 --> 00:26:27.826]  He's been up all night long.
[00:26:28.307 --> 00:26:30.569]  We have his exclusive statement up on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:33.312]  We'll obviously take the audio and the video of this right now.
[00:26:33.412 --> 00:26:35.454]  Roger Stone's exclusive interview.
[00:26:36.555 --> 00:26:38.196]  First interview after being released from jail.
[00:26:38.216 --> 00:26:45.141]  We're going to post this immediately to Infowars.com to the exclusive first statement from Roger Stone after his arrest.
[00:26:45.741 --> 00:26:48.823]  Stone slams Mueller as a rogue prosecutor.
[00:26:48.843 --> 00:26:52.025]  Sent text message last night said they're setting me up for the kill.
[00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:59.349]  The last thing he sent me was a meme somebody made of myself, Faith Goldie and Roger saying the
[00:27:01.195 --> 00:27:02.676]  The unpersoned, the disappeared.
[00:27:03.657 --> 00:27:06.278]  And he said, I think they're going to probably arrest me tomorrow.
[00:27:06.879 --> 00:27:09.120]  And I had a long conversation with him yesterday and I said, how do you know?
[00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.561]  And he goes, I can just see it.
[00:27:10.621 --> 00:27:14.384]  He goes, there's all these puff pieces about how I've been treated bad and it's kind of mean.
[00:27:14.864 --> 00:27:16.365]  And that's the media knowing it's coming.
[00:27:16.385 --> 00:27:18.687]  They don't want to look like bad guys for demonizing him.
[00:27:19.227 --> 00:27:23.870]  So CNN reporter admits he was waiting outside Roger Stone's house an hour before the arrest.
[00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.991]  He's still not picking up?
[00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:29.674]  Well, this is just driving me absolutely crazy.
[00:27:30.629 --> 00:27:38.434]  Well, at least we got the world exclusion, but he had a lot more to add and able to reach out to the President and tell the President what he thinks the President obviously needs to do.
[00:27:42.077 --> 00:27:44.098]  And I just got IT just called.
[00:27:44.698 --> 00:27:46.920]  They said we're being hit with denial of service attacks.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:48.621]  There are definitely denial of service attacks.
[00:27:48.641 --> 00:27:49.362]  It's not just traffic.
[00:27:50.302 --> 00:27:53.324]  So they're attacking the feeds right now in 4's life.
[00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:59.863]  Again, and the cell phone to Grant Smith, his lawyer, cut out repeatedly.
[00:28:00.143 --> 00:28:01.343]  That's not Roger doing that.
[00:28:02.444 --> 00:28:04.024]  Hello, this is Grant Smith.
[00:28:04.044 --> 00:28:08.366]  So that may be, that may be, again, all the bandwidth being sucked up out of there.
[00:28:08.786 --> 00:28:10.747]  I'm going to text Grant, tell him to call us via landline.
[00:28:10.847 --> 00:28:12.847]  I'm going to text Grant right now.
[00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:17.569]  Okay.
[00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.131]  Okay, let's go to Roger Stone.
[00:28:22.151 --> 00:28:22.691]  He came outside.
[00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:22.991]  Here it is.
[00:28:25.094 --> 00:28:25.734]  He's going to speak.
[00:28:26.255 --> 00:28:27.515]  He speaks for himself.
[00:28:27.976 --> 00:28:32.178]  You know that Roger Stone has always spoken for himself.
[00:28:32.238 --> 00:28:36.181]  He's never been shy about telling his story.
[00:28:37.161 --> 00:28:38.122]  He is innocent.
[00:28:38.502 --> 00:28:41.924]  We're going to defend this case and we're going to win this case.
[00:28:41.984 --> 00:28:47.808]  But let me start out by saying that the spectacle this morning was completely unnecessary.
[00:28:48.388 --> 00:28:50.630]  Everyone knows where Roger Stone is.
[00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.151]  He's not in hiding.
[00:28:52.811 --> 00:28:56.894]  The spectacle this morning with a SWAT team breaking into his house.
[00:28:56.974 --> 00:28:58.675]  Alright, we got this DVR and it's live.
[00:28:58.695 --> 00:28:59.596]  We'll be back in three minutes.
[00:28:59.616 --> 00:28:59.996]  Stay with us.
[00:29:08.666 --> 00:29:17.412]  If the Deep State and Robert Mueller and his allies now in the Democratic House succeed in destroying me, who will be next?
[00:29:17.873 --> 00:29:24.877]  You see, I've been targeted because I stood up for America, because I stood up for our president and his reform agenda.
[00:29:25.298 --> 00:29:28.080]  And now I have no choice but to appeal to you.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.765]  I am very grateful to all those Americans who have stepped forward to help me so far in this extraordinary legal struggle.
[00:29:36.065 --> 00:29:38.567]  But now I need your help as never before.
[00:29:39.047 --> 00:29:41.869]  Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:29:42.209 --> 00:29:43.971]  Help me stand up for America.
[00:29:44.091 --> 00:29:47.293]  Because if they get Roger Stone, you may be next.
[00:29:48.033 --> 00:29:55.018]  The real truth can be found at InfoWars.com, StoneColdTruth.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:29:56.471 --> 00:29:57.191]  InfoWars.
[00:29:57.812 --> 00:29:59.452]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:03.874]  Here's the thing.
[00:30:03.934 --> 00:30:05.294]  I know how metaphysics works.
[00:30:05.394 --> 00:30:06.535]  I know how the universe works.
[00:30:07.195 --> 00:30:09.256]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:30:10.456 --> 00:30:14.057]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:30:14.657 --> 00:30:17.098]  There is no set stasis.
[00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:19.859]  There is no managed system.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:21.400]  There is no
[00:30:23.829 --> 00:30:24.510]  Uncontinual.
[00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.993]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:30:31.034 --> 00:30:39.540]  So... I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.161]  And that would be a very true statement.
[00:30:43.002 --> 00:30:49.146]  If I don't have the will... InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[00:30:50.227 --> 00:30:51.668]  If I fight as hard as I can...
[00:30:53.464 --> 00:30:55.104]  And people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[00:30:56.585 --> 00:31:01.706]  You support us and get creative and get fired up, we won't just be here a hundred years, we'll be here forever.
[00:31:02.086 --> 00:31:03.206]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:31:04.366 --> 00:31:12.568]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are gonna look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[00:31:12.948 --> 00:31:18.389]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[00:31:18.429 --> 00:31:19.870]  Like Christ said, I have other flocks.
[00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:21.230]  It's a lot of...
[00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:23.038]  God's big.
[00:31:23.118 --> 00:31:24.579]  God makes a lot of stuff, you know?
[00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:26.800]  And, you know, I want to be on the winning team.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.841]  I want to like, hey, hey, come on in.
[00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:29.601]  You made it.
[00:31:29.961 --> 00:31:30.561]  Good to have you here.
[00:31:31.242 --> 00:31:37.724]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:31:38.725 --> 00:31:40.405]  And so this is playland.
[00:31:40.485 --> 00:31:41.566]  This is baby town.
[00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:42.846]  This is dressed up.
[00:31:42.866 --> 00:31:45.628]  This is like little boys playing soldier in the woods.
[00:31:46.268 --> 00:31:49.209]  All I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:51.190]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:31:52.236 --> 00:31:55.598]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[00:31:56.038 --> 00:31:57.159]  Not these devil worshippers.
[00:31:57.199 --> 00:31:59.880]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:00.901]  I want life!
[00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:02.341]  I want Jesus!
[00:32:02.802 --> 00:32:08.825]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:32:09.185 --> 00:32:11.807]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[00:32:12.407 --> 00:32:15.829]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:32:16.109 --> 00:32:18.190]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years.
[00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.351]  It is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:32:20.791 --> 00:32:24.072]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:32:24.953 --> 00:32:35.197]  Our pure tumeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:32:35.957 --> 00:32:44.500]  Regular tumeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our tumeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[00:32:46.121 --> 00:32:54.665]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.
[00:32:55.185 --> 00:32:59.447]  Try Bodies today at infowarslife.com or call us at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:32:59.467 --> 00:33:00.747]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:47.199 --> 00:33:49.821]  All right, I warned Roger Stone off-air earlier.
[00:33:49.921 --> 00:33:52.744]  I said, when you go out there, they're gonna heckle you and shout you down.
[00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:54.045]  He said, really?
[00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.006]  This is during the break?
[00:33:55.026 --> 00:33:59.830]  And I said, yeah, you need to stand with us as long as possible, so you'll have a clear broadcast to get out what you want.
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.580]  They're going to cherry pick this.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.641]  Now, this is near live.
[00:34:02.701 --> 00:34:05.121]  We went to break three minutes ago, four minutes ago.
[00:34:05.601 --> 00:34:09.382]  We've got it paused on the DVR in there from the CNN feed.
[00:34:10.063 --> 00:34:12.323]  We've also got his lawyer coming on later.
[00:34:12.403 --> 00:34:16.304]  Roger will be back on later with us once he gets in the car, goes home, takes a shower.
[00:34:16.724 --> 00:34:20.905]  You'll get global exclusives here at Infowars.com on the live feeds, the war room, you name it.
[00:34:21.405 --> 00:34:24.026]  But he went out and here's the left screaming over him.
[00:34:24.286 --> 00:34:26.747]  Don't let a man that's just been indicted have his voice.
[00:34:27.407 --> 00:34:28.108]  Shut him down!
[00:34:28.228 --> 00:34:29.169]  Shut him off the web!
[00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:30.290]  Shut him off the internet!
[00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.651]  Shut him down off TV!
[00:34:31.932 --> 00:34:33.793]  Let's go to his live press conference.
[00:34:33.813 --> 00:34:34.174]  Here it is.
[00:34:35.094 --> 00:34:36.215]  He's not in hiding.
[00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:45.622]  The spectacle this morning with a SWAT team breaking into his house, searching the house, scaring his wife, scaring his dogs.
[00:34:46.162 --> 00:34:47.583]  Completely unnecessary.
[00:34:47.983 --> 00:34:51.966]  A telephone call would have done the job, and Mr. Stone would have appeared.
[00:34:52.366 --> 00:34:55.008]  But let me let Roger speak for himself.
[00:34:55.108 --> 00:34:56.249]  He has nothing to hide.
[00:34:56.269 --> 00:34:57.690]  He has nothing to hide.
[00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:00.512]  And he's spoken before, and he'll speak to you now.
[00:35:00.612 --> 00:35:00.933]  Roger?
[00:35:05.296 --> 00:35:06.236]  Thank you.
[00:35:06.757 --> 00:35:07.437]  Thank you.
[00:35:07.497 --> 00:35:07.817]  Well?
[00:35:08.398 --> 00:35:09.378]  Thank you.
[00:35:09.578 --> 00:35:11.300]  Thank you very much.
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.441]  I think it's cussed out everywhere in Florida.
[00:35:14.522 --> 00:35:15.642]  Things thrown at him, assaulted.
[00:35:15.662 --> 00:35:22.887]  As I have always said, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.
[00:35:22.927 --> 00:35:23.988]  Don't let him speak!
[00:35:24.148 --> 00:35:24.828]  That's the left!
[00:35:25.629 --> 00:35:27.250]  Two-year inquisition.
[00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:39.283]  The charges today relate in no way to Russian collusion, WikiLeaks collaboration, or any other illegal act in connection with the 2016 campaign.
[00:35:39.323 --> 00:35:41.325]  This is beyond a movie.
[00:35:41.565 --> 00:35:49.094]  This is a mad mob, no Russia, trying to take his speech and put him in prison like they're doing the Infowars.
[00:35:49.774 --> 00:35:57.421]  Any error I made in my testimony would be both immaterial and without intent.
[00:35:57.521 --> 00:36:04.707]  I find it disturbing that the special counsel's office released a press release
[00:36:05.868 --> 00:36:11.132]  Prior to informing my attorneys that I would be charged today.
[00:36:11.773 --> 00:36:30.127]  This morning, at the crack of dawn, 29 FBI agents arrived at my home with 17 vehicles, with their lights flashing, when they could simply have contacted my attorneys, and I would have been more than willing to surrender voluntarily.
[00:36:31.528 --> 00:36:34.571]  They terrorized my wife, my dogs.
[00:36:35.472 --> 00:36:43.219]  I was taken to the FBI facility, although I must say the FBI agents were extraordinarily courteous.
[00:36:45.641 --> 00:36:47.323]  Not guilty to these charges.
[00:36:48.004 --> 00:36:49.946]  I will defeat them in court.
[00:36:50.647 --> 00:36:54.551]  I believe this is a politically motivated investigation.
[00:36:55.512 --> 00:36:59.776]  I am troubled by the political motivations of the prosecutors.
[00:37:00.897 --> 00:37:04.862]  And as I have said previously, there is no circumstance
[00:37:05.482 --> 00:37:15.256]  Whatsoever, under which I will bear false witness against the President, nor will I make up lies to ease the pressure on myself.
[00:37:15.857 --> 00:37:19.502]  I look forward to being fully and completely vindicated.
[00:37:26.408 --> 00:37:34.474]  Since I was not contacted prior to the charges today, my lawyers have not talked to the special prosecutors.
[00:37:34.514 --> 00:37:40.679]  I don't want to address that question, but I have made it clear I will not justify against the president.
[00:37:40.699 --> 00:37:43.681]  Because I would have to bear false witness against him.
[00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:45.883]  I will be appearing for an arraignment in DC.
[00:37:51.287 --> 00:37:54.130]  Next week, and I'll address those questions at that time.
[00:37:58.834 --> 00:38:00.415]  Well, I intend to tell the truth.
[00:38:00.535 --> 00:38:09.663]  I have told the truth through this entire proceeding, and I will prove that in a court of law.
[00:38:09.824 --> 00:38:11.245]  I am one of his oldest friends.
[00:38:11.865 --> 00:38:15.088]  I am a fervent supporter of the president.
[00:38:15.569 --> 00:38:18.071]  I think he is doing a great job of making America
[00:38:18.371 --> 00:38:18.831]  Great again.
[00:38:18.871 --> 00:38:22.693]  Roger, did anyone tell you to contact, in the Trump campaign, to contact WikiLeaks?
[00:38:23.314 --> 00:38:23.814]  Uh, no.
[00:38:23.994 --> 00:38:25.015]  I've addressed that before.
[00:38:25.055 --> 00:38:26.435]  That is incorrect.
[00:38:26.636 --> 00:38:32.459]  If you were convicted, do you think the President would pardon you?
[00:38:32.519 --> 00:38:32.939]  Pardon me?
[00:38:33.479 --> 00:38:36.121]  If you were convicted, do you think the President would pardon you?
[00:38:36.141 --> 00:38:39.963]  The only person I have advocated a pardon for is Marcus Garvey.
[00:38:41.063 --> 00:38:42.304]  I'm from NBC News, sir.
[00:38:42.324 --> 00:38:50.210]  My question is, did you in any way work with the Russians to help President Trump?
[00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.431]  Categorically?
[00:38:51.771 --> 00:38:53.413]  Categorically not, no.
[00:38:53.753 --> 00:38:54.393]  Absolutely not.
[00:38:54.613 --> 00:38:57.255]  And the lawsuits you had, they're very special.
[00:38:57.275 --> 00:38:58.656]  So see, this is our title.
[00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:10.781]  This is emblematic of, hey Roger, you go out there to those thousands of reporters, they're going to shout you down, and you're not going to hear a damn word you say, and then it's going to be you deny that you're a Russian.
[00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:12.102]  There is no Russia.
[00:39:12.363 --> 00:39:16.347]  There is nothing except Mueller and Hillary, who were desperate to cover up their Russia ties.
[00:39:18.359 --> 00:39:21.522]  Biggest joke ever.
[00:39:21.922 --> 00:39:24.804]  Roger will be back on the show this hour, next hour.
[00:39:25.345 --> 00:39:27.887]  He will be here live, so you will hear Roger Stone.
[00:39:28.628 --> 00:39:42.019]  He's going to think I literally am Nostradamus or Karnak when I call him up as soon as I get him on the damn line because I told him, I said, you march out there, they are going to scream and yell over you, including the reporters themselves.
[00:39:42.039 --> 00:39:42.960]  They're a bunch of political activists.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.561]  Go back to that feed.
[00:39:44.384 --> 00:39:46.444]  And they're going to do all this.
[00:39:46.565 --> 00:39:50.165]  You've got to go out and you've got to say this is a war on the press.
[00:39:50.685 --> 00:39:52.106]  This is a war on free speech.
[00:39:52.126 --> 00:39:57.307]  A man whose dirty tricks in politics goes back to the Nixon years in American politics.
[00:39:57.627 --> 00:40:00.187]  Roger Stone denying emphatically the charges.
[00:40:00.247 --> 00:40:02.128]  He said he has not had a chance to read the indictment.
[00:40:02.428 --> 00:40:08.789]  He says he will not testify against the president because doing so, Roger Stone's words would require... Let me tell you what dirty tricks are.
[00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:11.770]  Dirty tricks is teaching five-year-old boys how to put dresses on.
[00:40:13.117 --> 00:40:18.861]  Dirty tricks is what the mainstream corporate media does, saying that Trump took the bust of Martin Luther King out of the White House.
[00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:21.542]  Jim Acosta, that's the dirty tricks.
[00:40:21.562 --> 00:40:23.864]  Here's some more of the crap coming out of their mouths.
[00:40:24.838 --> 00:40:36.263]  ...under investigation, but I was talking to, you know, Roger Stone's friends in the last couple of days, and they said they've watched what happened, that Roger Stone has watched what happened to Paul Manafort, and he does not want the same thing to happen again.
[00:40:36.283 --> 00:40:37.283]  No, that's right, he's not going to keep quiet.
[00:40:37.303 --> 00:40:41.885]  He says he looks at what happened to Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman... That's not very... Yeah, no Russian collusion!
[00:40:42.465 --> 00:40:44.286]  Income tax stuff from 15 years ago.
[00:40:44.646 --> 00:40:46.627]  Same thing with the idiot Michael Cohen.
[00:40:47.908 --> 00:40:49.488]  Let's go to this feed here of Stone.
[00:40:49.528 --> 00:40:51.809]  Let's hear this live feed of Stone walking down the steps.
[00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:53.190]  I guess this is from when he came down earlier.
[00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:56.778]  He makes that joke and does that Nixonian thing.
[00:40:56.798 --> 00:40:58.119]  I don't think any of that's funny.
[00:40:58.919 --> 00:41:00.680]  I mean, I like Roger and everything.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.681]  He said that the FBI is just the way they came.
[00:41:02.701 --> 00:41:04.963]  He said, if they just called me, I would have come in.
[00:41:05.143 --> 00:41:06.183]  Are there guidelines?
[00:41:06.323 --> 00:41:06.644]  Yes.
[00:41:06.704 --> 00:41:12.006]  Are there reasons that the FBI, that's what I'm going to get to, that they had some reason to believe... That's enough from CNN.
[00:41:12.067 --> 00:41:14.728]  They did that to make him look like a guilty criminal.
[00:41:15.388 --> 00:41:16.829]  I've told you this a thousand times.
[00:41:17.249 --> 00:41:19.311]  They'll have like year-long stings I've seen.
[00:41:20.402 --> 00:41:25.464]  on Amish people who don't even sell milk or cheese.
[00:41:25.564 --> 00:41:35.047]  But the government wants their property, in a famous case in Pennsylvania, another one in Michigan, between a federal and state park.
[00:41:35.067 --> 00:41:36.708]  They wanted that land to build a road.
[00:41:37.288 --> 00:41:38.048]  A couple hundred acres.
[00:41:38.388 --> 00:41:40.189]  I've had the lawyers for them on years ago.
[00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:43.030]  Well, several Amish groups.
[00:41:44.312 --> 00:41:49.361]  And so for like a year, these neighbors move in and they keep begging, please sell us cheese.
[00:41:50.062 --> 00:41:53.808]  And finally the Amish guy goes, I'll just give you cheese.
[00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.821]  And they go, great, I'm going to give it to my cousin in the next state.
[00:41:57.941 --> 00:41:59.962]  Well, give it to whoever you want, sonny.
[00:42:00.703 --> 00:42:02.604]  Interstate crime now.
[00:42:02.884 --> 00:42:04.025]  Got an Amish guy.
[00:42:04.645 --> 00:42:07.126]  He didn't wipe his butt properly at age two.
[00:42:07.726 --> 00:42:09.087]  That's a real criminal you got there.
[00:42:09.147 --> 00:42:09.907]  Real El Chapo.
[00:42:10.548 --> 00:42:13.789]  And then they come in with SWAT teams, guns, shove their heads down, everything.
[00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:18.172]  But see, the average jury thinks, well, they must be bad if they did this.
[00:42:18.232 --> 00:42:19.572]  Instead, no, this is bad.
[00:42:20.293 --> 00:42:20.873]  This is bad.
[00:42:22.754 --> 00:42:24.335]  Now, here's my plug, because I barely plug.
[00:42:25.185 --> 00:42:26.846]  And I'm not trying to write myself into the story.
[00:42:26.886 --> 00:42:27.987]  Believe me, I wish this would stop.
[00:42:28.447 --> 00:42:29.548]  Here's the Washington Post.
[00:42:29.588 --> 00:42:30.288]  Here it all is.
[00:42:30.769 --> 00:42:39.034]  We're under investigation for fake hush money to Corsi, who we've been working with for 16 years, saying paying him is hush money.
[00:42:39.515 --> 00:42:41.896]  And I've got reporters calling up saying, are you the next to be indicted?
[00:42:41.956 --> 00:42:44.298]  And Mueller has the grand jury talking about this.
[00:42:44.358 --> 00:42:45.759]  So you're like, well, that makes sense.
[00:42:45.779 --> 00:42:46.259]  That's crazy.
[00:42:46.519 --> 00:42:47.620]  That's how witch hunts work.
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.401]  So I need money to fight this period.
[00:42:49.902 --> 00:42:54.825]  They've been trying to curtail us, shut us down, censor us ahead of the setup.
[00:42:55.325 --> 00:42:56.866]  So, this is the Waterloo.
[00:42:56.886 --> 00:42:58.207]  If you don't do it, we're done.
[00:42:58.227 --> 00:42:59.448]  We need massive funding.
[00:42:59.689 --> 00:43:00.689]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:00.749 --> 00:43:01.330]  Go there now!
[00:43:03.732 --> 00:43:04.753]  Somebody had to do it.
[00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:16.557]  Somebody had to stand up against Hillary Clinton and the globalist deep state crime cartel that was running America into the ground and trying to bankrupt our nation and demoralize our people.
[00:43:17.958 --> 00:43:18.438]  And I've done it.
[00:43:18.978 --> 00:43:20.118]  People like Roger Stone have done it.
[00:43:20.719 --> 00:43:22.499]  The listeners and viewers of this broadcast have done it.
[00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:28.301]  You have stood up, you have taken action, you have ignited a global awakening to the New World Order.
[00:43:28.921 --> 00:43:34.543]  And its system, from the corrupt EU to the UN to the globalists here in the US, is falling apart.
[00:43:35.472 --> 00:43:40.454]  But now, they're striking and attacking all the major leaders of the resistance.
[00:43:41.214 --> 00:43:43.515]  They've tried to put Marie Le Pen in prison twice.
[00:43:44.575 --> 00:43:47.836]  They've tried to kill people like Nigel Farage at least five times.
[00:43:48.536 --> 00:43:53.318]  They're desperately trying to set us up and get people to lie about Infowars to put us in prison.
[00:43:53.718 --> 00:43:54.678]  That's now admitted.
[00:43:55.178 --> 00:43:56.619]  I've told you it's been going on for two years.
[00:43:57.259 --> 00:43:59.400]  And now Roger Stone has been indicted.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:13.348]  Zero Russia connection, zero Russia collusion, supposedly lying with no evidence to Congress about the fact that he wasn't in direct contact with Julian Assange, which he wasn't.
[00:44:14.497 --> 00:44:16.579]  Now being a journalist is a crime in this country.
[00:44:16.999 --> 00:44:25.565]  First they silence you off the internet, first they restrict your voice, and then they put you in prison, and historically, then they start killing people.
[00:44:26.226 --> 00:44:28.908]  First they silence, then they imprison, then they kill.
[00:44:29.188 --> 00:44:30.409]  It's here, it's happening now.
[00:44:30.749 --> 00:44:32.331]  I think Americans aren't cowards.
[00:44:32.431 --> 00:44:45.886]  I think Americans are going to stand up and see this clear and present day for what it is and understand that Robert Mueller and others are rogue, out of control, governments under themselves, working for the deep state, who themselves are the real traitors who are trying to sell America out to globalism itself.
[00:44:46.326 --> 00:44:50.492]  Whatever you do, the Quickenings here are going to try to take down Trump now and Infowars.
[00:44:50.733 --> 00:44:55.460]  So pray for us and financially support us at InfowarsStore.com today and be part of history.
[00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:58.364]  Thank you again, but now is the time to spread the word.
[00:44:58.705 --> 00:45:00.027]  Now is the time to get aggressive.
[00:45:00.307 --> 00:45:01.950]  Now is the time to join the Infowar.
[00:45:08.517 --> 00:45:17.245]  If the deep state and Robert Mueller and his allies now in the Democratic House succeed in destroying me, who will be next?
[00:45:17.725 --> 00:45:20.628]  You see, I've been targeted because I stood up for America.
[00:45:20.908 --> 00:45:24.731]  Because I stood up for our president and his reform agenda.
[00:45:25.152 --> 00:45:27.934]  And now I have no choice but to appeal to you.
[00:45:28.855 --> 00:45:35.598]  I am very grateful for all those Americans who have stepped forward to help me so far in this extraordinary legal struggle.
[00:45:35.898 --> 00:45:38.419]  But now I need your help as never before.
[00:45:38.879 --> 00:45:41.700]  Please go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.741]  Help me stand up for America.
[00:45:43.921 --> 00:45:46.962]  Because if they get Roger Stone, you may be next.

[00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:21.832]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:23.995]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:49:23.991 --> 00:49:25.672]  Special Report.
[00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:28.212]  Now reporting, George Stephanopoulos.
[00:49:28.793 --> 00:49:29.353]  Good morning.
[00:49:29.373 --> 00:49:32.534]  We are coming on the air right now with breaking news in the Russia investigation.
[00:49:32.574 --> 00:49:36.955]  Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted longtime Trump associate Roger Stone.
[00:49:37.055 --> 00:49:41.177]  We have some major breaking news in the Mueller investigation.
[00:49:41.357 --> 00:49:47.459]  Roger Stone, who advised President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, has been arrested.
[00:49:47.739 --> 00:49:52.341]  Roger Stone is under arrest in Florida, that according to special counsel Robert Mueller's office.
[00:49:52.461 --> 00:49:57.283]  Former Trump advisor Roger Stone has been arrested in Fort Lauderdale.
[00:49:57.363 --> 00:50:02.445]  Roger Stone arrested following an indictment, we're told, that was yesterday, but he was just arrested this morning.
[00:50:02.505 --> 00:50:05.426]  Mr. Stone was arrested in Fort Lauderdale today.
[00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:13.929]  This is what the first sounds that Roger Stone woke up to this morning was the FBI pounding on his door and shouting this.
[00:50:14.009 --> 00:50:15.230]  I want to just play this for a moment.
[00:50:19.275 --> 00:50:26.965]  He is facing the prospect of a lengthy jail term where he to be convicted of all the charges that he faces.
[00:50:27.105 --> 00:50:28.627]  One count of obstruction of justice.
[00:50:28.807 --> 00:50:31.210]  One count of obstruction of an official proceeding.
[00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:33.213]  Five counts of making false statements.
[00:50:33.273 --> 00:50:34.695]  Obstruction and false statements.
[00:50:34.835 --> 00:50:35.556]  Witness tampering.
[00:50:35.876 --> 00:50:40.518]  Five counts of giving false statements and one count of witness tampering.
[00:50:40.818 --> 00:50:52.801]  It will, it ought, no longer be possible for Donald Trump and his supporters to say that the Robert Mueller probe has found no evidence of collusion in the 2016 election campaign.
[00:50:55.973 --> 00:50:58.177]  My first reaction is real simple.
[00:50:58.197 --> 00:51:02.483]  This has nothing to do with the president and certainly nothing to do with the White House.
[00:51:03.325 --> 00:51:09.454]  This is something that has to do solely with that individual and not something that affects us here in this building.
[00:51:10.225 --> 00:51:11.506]  Nothing to do with the President.
[00:51:11.827 --> 00:51:24.980]  On this show, a couple months ago, Corey Lewandowski, who was one-time campaign manager to then-candidate Donald Trump, used to tell me it would make him crazy when then-candidate Trump would talk to Roger Stone on the phone, and it would happen a lot.
[00:51:25.060 --> 00:51:29.425]  So there is a connection between Roger Stone and the now-President of the United States.
[00:51:29.445 --> 00:51:30.246]  You would concede that.
[00:51:31.065 --> 00:51:48.654]  Look, Roger Stone is somebody who's been a consultant for dozens of Republican presidents and candidates and members of Congress, but conversations between those individuals have nothing to do with the fact of what these charges are about, and that's about whether or not he made false statements.
[00:51:49.074 --> 00:51:50.635]  We'll let the courts make that decision.
[00:51:50.935 --> 00:51:59.640]  I think a bigger question is, if this is the standard, will this same standard apply to people like Hillary Clinton, James Comey?
[00:52:00.581 --> 00:52:10.756]  Okay, so here's your big breaking global news.
[00:52:11.177 --> 00:52:15.463]  Roger Stone's been indicted, SWAT team raided in a pre-dawn operation.
[00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:24.273]  I told him, I said, when you march out to that big crowd of people, over a thousand reporters, they're going to shout you down, including the reporters, because these aren't reporters now.
[00:52:24.333 --> 00:52:30.135]  Corporate media is about strangling speech, strangling America, and shutting down any competition.
[00:52:31.435 --> 00:52:33.496]  That's what mainstream media is, or gatekeepers.
[00:52:34.497 --> 00:52:36.957]  I said, you go out there, they're going to shut your whole speech down.
[00:52:37.798 --> 00:52:40.379]  You should make it about the attack on free speech when they do it.
[00:52:40.879 --> 00:52:42.620]  Walked out, they did it, Roger didn't do it.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:43.180]  Fine!
[00:52:44.195 --> 00:52:47.336]  You know, when total victory is just handed to you, why the hell take it?
[00:52:47.536 --> 00:52:48.516]  But I love Roger to death.
[00:52:49.237 --> 00:53:07.163]  Then, I've asked our wonderful crew of on-target, focused, awake people, they are awesome, which they're doing, to take all three of those segments with Roger on with us and say Roger Stone's exclusive global statement on his indictment.
[00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:09.690]  That they don't want you to hear or see.
[00:53:10.431 --> 00:53:15.953]  Because you heard him come out, and I said when he first came on, in fact, let's get the first five minutes.
[00:53:16.813 --> 00:53:17.613]  That's what we'll do.
[00:53:18.053 --> 00:53:21.335]  We'll just re-air all of what Roger said next hour.
[00:53:21.975 --> 00:53:23.575]  And Roger's gonna be popping back on with us.
[00:53:24.016 --> 00:53:30.918]  But imagine my frustration knowing the next move they're gonna make, generaling, proving we can get people elected and defeat the globalists.
[00:53:31.338 --> 00:53:32.339]  What do I know, though?
[00:53:32.639 --> 00:53:33.419]  I'm an idiot.
[00:53:33.679 --> 00:53:34.639]  I'm a moron.
[00:53:34.659 --> 00:53:34.699]  So.
[00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:46.299]  We're going to come back in the next hour and play the three segments, that means the three segments, one, two, and three of the last hour when Roger Stone was on.
[00:53:46.319 --> 00:53:46.879]  Because why?
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:54.964]  Because when he went out to a thousand plus so-called journalists and reporters and TV cameras, they booed and screamed him down.
[00:53:56.205 --> 00:53:58.507]  And videos coming out, they couldn't help themselves.
[00:53:59.414 --> 00:54:00.514]  They're so out of control.
[00:54:00.574 --> 00:54:01.295]  They're so crazy.
[00:54:01.535 --> 00:54:10.657]  The only place that linked to the one place you could actually hear Roger Stone was DrudgeReport.com outside of InfoWars.com.
[00:54:10.977 --> 00:54:12.598]  That's the only place.
[00:54:13.158 --> 00:54:17.039]  They all, with great discipline, were all angry, were getting upset.
[00:54:17.399 --> 00:54:20.360]  We had people in the crowd going, oh my God, he's on with Alex Jones.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:21.601]  Well, yeah, he works here.
[00:54:21.981 --> 00:54:23.922]  They're trying to indict me, indict my dad.
[00:54:23.962 --> 00:54:24.802]  They're coming after me.
[00:54:24.982 --> 00:54:26.883]  They asked about me in the grand jury for a year and a half.
[00:54:27.303 --> 00:54:36.488]  They're trying to say that I pay employees, that I'm involved in hush money for your stupid Russia crap, when it's Mueller and Hillary and you globalists that have the Russians up your rear ends.
[00:54:36.508 --> 00:54:46.793]  So I'm a little wound up today, but we will get you, not a piece of Roger, the entire interview aired live in the next hour.
[00:54:47.739 --> 00:54:51.142]  We're gonna air it 1, 2, 3, Swedish Pie.
[00:54:51.923 --> 00:55:01.872]  So you can hear what Roger Stone actually had to say in one of the biggest media frenzies, if not the biggest, the world's ever seen, where they piranha-like have no Russia collusion.
[00:55:02.713 --> 00:55:06.597]  They're totally trying to set journalists up, ending all basic freedom in this country.
[00:55:08.737 --> 00:55:17.482]  And they drowned him out where he can't even talk when he's got a giant press conference, because they had Democratic operatives all looking at their phones saying, shut him up!
[00:55:17.622 --> 00:55:18.963]  Don't let him talk when he comes out!
[00:55:19.243 --> 00:55:20.624]  Don't let him have this giant crowd!
[00:55:20.644 --> 00:55:21.704]  Because they've all got to cover it!
[00:55:22.245 --> 00:55:28.748]  What they wanted was him being booed and shut down, and so he was, in a big disgusting coup for the deep state bastards!
[00:55:29.368 --> 00:55:30.529]  Absolute bastards!
[00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:33.631]  So, here we are ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:35.049 --> 00:55:43.172]  Covering this all, witnessing it, watching it happen in slow motion, watching the public drool and not know, kind of addle around, and not know what's going on.
[00:55:43.192 --> 00:55:43.653]  But you know what?
[00:55:45.473 --> 00:55:47.634]  I'm awake, and I'm here, and I'm covering it.
[00:55:47.794 --> 00:55:48.935]  And I'm going to just say this right now.
[00:55:50.638 --> 00:55:51.919]  You want the globalists to win?
[00:55:52.359 --> 00:55:55.780]  They've already successfully basically stopped the expansion plans here at InfoWars.
[00:55:55.961 --> 00:55:56.861]  That's a huge victory for them.
[00:55:57.221 --> 00:55:58.142]  I'm not going to lie, that's their victory.
[00:55:58.482 --> 00:56:11.648]  The lawsuits, taking our sponsors, taking our platforms, harassing the living hell out of us, ahead of silencing us, which they failed to do, ahead of the coup de grace, taking Trump out, and all those little establishment minions around him that are lying to him.
[00:56:12.148 --> 00:56:13.710]  They're going to flush them down the toilet as well.
[00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:19.175]  So we're here as an emergency, warning the public, exposing globalists of doing it, and I need your financial support.
[00:56:19.516 --> 00:56:21.158]  I need you to get products you already need.
[00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:36.380]  Like the great nootropic brain force, or the great new product we have, TurboForce, that's beyond a pre-workout, beyond the ultimate energy drink with all the vitamins, minerals, all the great co-factors, five different types of natural slow-burning caffeine, so instead of going five hours, it lasts ten hours without the crash.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.621]  The ultimate!
[00:56:38.201 --> 00:56:39.122]  The ultimate!
[00:56:39.142 --> 00:56:40.603]  Just like our information's the ultimate!
[00:56:41.063 --> 00:56:41.824]  The ultimate!
[00:56:42.384 --> 00:56:46.267]  TurboForce, energy, metabolic system, alertness.
[00:56:48.246 --> 00:56:48.726]  Focus.
[00:56:48.906 --> 00:56:49.426]  Everything.
[00:56:49.587 --> 00:56:50.507]  It is incredible.
[00:56:50.527 --> 00:56:53.428]  There are other brands that cost twice as much that aren't even as good.
[00:56:53.508 --> 00:56:54.868]  It's 33% off out of the gates.
[00:56:55.149 --> 00:56:58.290]  And that's how I fund this operation.
[00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:00.751]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:01.491 --> 00:57:02.571]  Newswars.com.
[00:57:03.111 --> 00:57:05.872]  Tomorrow's news today, but I need every listener to understand.
[00:57:07.053 --> 00:57:09.654]  Roger Stone was silenced at his press conference.
[00:57:11.144 --> 00:57:14.025]  So see his official uncensored statement.
[00:57:14.105 --> 00:57:14.806]  I mean, that's it.
[00:57:15.626 --> 00:57:21.969]  You saw the spectacle of those anti-free speech monsters not wanting you to hear what he had to say.
[00:57:21.989 --> 00:57:22.509]  Well, guess what?
[00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:30.593]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and DreadReport.com still has the link up there at the very damn top.
[00:57:32.003 --> 00:57:32.864]  InfoWarsLive.
[00:57:33.424 --> 00:57:34.745]  You should probably switch that out for the audio.
[00:57:34.766 --> 00:57:35.826]  Links to scratch for servers.
[00:57:36.407 --> 00:57:39.310]  But the point is, is that there it is.
[00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:43.013]  You'll be able to hear the exclusive interview coming up on the other side of this break.
[00:57:43.233 --> 00:57:45.655]  They don't want this man being framed and set up to have a voice.
[00:57:46.276 --> 00:57:47.497]  They want to shut our funding off.
[00:57:47.517 --> 00:57:52.141]  So flood us with capital now at InfoWarsStore.com if you want America to live!
[00:57:55.325 --> 00:57:58.027]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:57:58.368 --> 00:58:04.272]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:58:04.813 --> 00:58:16.803]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:05.230]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:09.751]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:59:10.192 --> 00:59:13.433]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:59:14.353 --> 00:59:24.580]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:33.886]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:59:35.527 --> 00:59:44.071]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:59:55.077 --> 01:00:00.980]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.783 --> 01:00:35.846]  All right, I have talked to Roger and his lawyer.
[01:00:35.926 --> 01:00:36.967]  He's going to come back on.
[01:00:37.848 --> 01:00:41.432]  They were literally thrown out of the courthouse the first time the phone cut out.
[01:00:41.452 --> 01:00:47.900]  The next time they grabbed the phone away and hung it up and threw them out because they were so scared of the thousands showing up.
[01:00:48.801 --> 01:00:49.362]  That's them again.
[01:00:50.263 --> 01:00:50.463]  Hello?
[01:00:53.561 --> 01:00:54.041]  Hey, let me do this.
[01:00:54.081 --> 01:00:54.681]  I'll call you right back.
[01:00:55.242 --> 01:00:59.423]  Anyways, Roger Stone's coming right back on, probably in 15-20 minutes.
[01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.304]  I've got his lawyer also ready to come on.
[01:01:02.724 --> 01:01:06.226]  And again, if I'm a little hyped up here with the crew, I'm just ready to win here.
[01:01:06.666 --> 01:01:07.586]  I'm ready to expose this.
[01:01:07.646 --> 01:01:09.167]  And I'm going to tell you, when I'm on, I'm on.
[01:01:09.187 --> 01:01:12.468]  I said, Roger, you're going to go out there, and they're going to drown you out.
[01:01:12.788 --> 01:01:14.589]  And they're going to, they're going to, they're going to, they're going to.
[01:01:14.669 --> 01:01:18.250]  And I said, all you can say is, oh, now you're against free press.
[01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:19.211]  You won't let me have my speech.
[01:01:19.411 --> 01:01:20.131]  I pulled him!
[01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:21.631]  And then it happened!
[01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:22.632]  I know the enemy!
[01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.591]  So, we're going to be looking at all the angles of that today.
[01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:30.292]  And we do have his exclusive, where he got to speak!
[01:01:31.012 --> 01:01:36.354]  Imagine someone charged with this anti-free speech, anti-journalism, garbage, no Russian collusion.
[01:01:36.634 --> 01:01:37.694]  He actually got to speak.
[01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:48.057]  So, coming up the start of the next segment, I am going to play what Roger said last hour so that everybody gets to see it and hear it again.
[01:01:48.077 --> 01:01:52.099]  And then we're going to take the interview as soon as we can and post it to InfoWars.com.
[01:01:52.119 --> 01:01:52.999]  It's being uploaded right now.
[01:01:53.939 --> 01:01:56.380]  But there's your headlines, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.420]  Roger Stone completely shut down.
[01:01:59.501 --> 01:02:01.421]  Not allowed to have any free speech.
[01:02:02.141 --> 01:02:05.683]  Roger Stone drowned out by lock him up chants while giving press conference.
[01:02:07.703 --> 01:02:08.723]  I told him it was going to happen.
[01:02:08.763 --> 01:02:10.284]  This was his chance to respond.
[01:02:11.204 --> 01:02:16.586]  And now he needs to come on air and talk about how this has happened and how he's had his speech taken.
[01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:18.126]  Because that's what this whole thing is.
[01:02:18.146 --> 01:02:20.067]  These people can't beat us politically.
[01:02:20.087 --> 01:02:23.148]  So they want to silence us, then frame us, then put us in jail.
[01:02:24.139 --> 01:02:26.862]  Silence us, frame us, put us in jail.
[01:02:27.383 --> 01:02:29.885]  Silence us, frame us, put us in jail.
[01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:32.728]  Silence us, frame us, put us in jail.
[01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:35.752]  Silence us, frame us, put us in jail.
[01:02:37.335 --> 01:02:43.239]  And he tries to go out and give a press conference, and the press itself, they were involved, because they're not the press.
[01:02:43.439 --> 01:02:44.620]  They're a bunch of Jim Acostas.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:54.407]  They shout him down his big opportunity in front of every damn news entity going out globally, because that was hundreds of millions of dollars of publicity.
[01:02:54.607 --> 01:02:56.509]  That was him getting to say he could do something.
[01:02:56.889 --> 01:02:57.749]  Roger Stone's back on?
[01:03:01.012 --> 01:03:01.292]  Live?
[01:03:03.253 --> 01:03:04.514]  Okay, let's bring Roger back up.
[01:03:04.574 --> 01:03:06.756]  Roger, did I not predict they drowned you out, my friend?
[01:03:07.682 --> 01:03:08.422]  Well, they tried.
[01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:29.452]  Yeah, no, the best thing about it, Alex, was that they were furious, furious that we were talking on InfoWars and made them cool their heels.
[01:03:30.212 --> 01:03:42.897]  CNN, MSNBC, Fox, all bombarding my lawyers with text messages and phone calls, going crazy because we were live and exclusive on InfoWars, so I'm very grateful for that.
[01:03:43.857 --> 01:03:46.378]  Um, you know, just to recap, uh, at
[01:03:47.795 --> 01:03:50.457]  Literally, the rise of the sun this morning.
[01:03:51.137 --> 01:03:56.601]  I had gotten up from bed to the pounding on the door.
[01:03:57.381 --> 01:04:04.125]  I looked down on the street and there were 17 vehicles, all with their lights on.
[01:04:05.266 --> 01:04:07.548]  I went to the front door, which has glass in it.
[01:04:07.848 --> 01:04:12.631]  There were two FBI agents pointing semi-automatic weapons at me.
[01:04:13.471 --> 01:04:16.552]  Shouting at the top of their lungs, open the door, open the door.
[01:04:17.192 --> 01:04:17.892]  I opened the door.
[01:04:17.972 --> 01:04:19.352]  They said, are you Roger Stone?
[01:04:19.392 --> 01:04:20.112]  They said, yes.
[01:04:20.812 --> 01:04:21.993]  They said, you're under arrest.
[01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:23.333]  Please step out of the house.
[01:04:24.033 --> 01:04:25.693]  I stepped out of the door.
[01:04:25.813 --> 01:04:27.094]  They put handcuffs on me.
[01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.114]  And they took me out in the front yard.
[01:04:30.874 --> 01:04:35.235]  They asked me if there were any weapons in the house.
[01:04:35.435 --> 01:04:36.075]  There are not.
[01:04:36.735 --> 01:04:38.916]  They asked me about my dogs.
[01:04:39.016 --> 01:04:39.836]  I said, they're harmless.
[01:04:40.501 --> 01:04:42.521]  They asked me who else was in the house.
[01:04:42.642 --> 01:04:43.442]  I said my wife.
[01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:44.202]  They said who else?
[01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:46.062]  I said my wife.
[01:04:46.162 --> 01:04:47.383]  They said but there's someone else.
[01:04:47.443 --> 01:04:48.463]  I said there is no one else.
[01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:49.723]  And there wasn't.
[01:04:50.243 --> 01:04:50.603]  Hold on.
[01:04:50.643 --> 01:04:51.363]  Stay right there.
[01:04:51.464 --> 01:04:52.084]  Don't hang up.
[01:04:52.564 --> 01:04:53.284]  World exclusive.
[01:04:53.344 --> 01:04:59.125]  Roger Stone not allowed with a thousand plus media to have his speech drowned out by members of the press.
[01:04:59.565 --> 01:05:01.106]  He'll have his speech straight ahead.
[01:05:01.666 --> 01:05:02.026]  Stay with us.
[01:05:04.878 --> 01:05:05.859]  Now you've stayed vigilant.
[01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:06.961]  You've been pushing the site.
[01:05:07.001 --> 01:05:08.202]  You've been helping us get it out there.
[01:05:08.282 --> 01:05:11.827]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[01:05:12.027 --> 01:05:15.131]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:05:15.251 --> 01:05:16.213]  Get that link out to everybody.
[01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:20.258]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil.
[01:05:20.498 --> 01:05:21.138]  It's turbo force!
[01:05:46.773 --> 01:05:49.195]  TurboForce is the ultimate vitamin mineral.
[01:05:49.275 --> 01:05:51.517]  Total energy fusion next level.
[01:05:51.577 --> 01:05:53.038]  Total mega package.
[01:05:53.098 --> 01:05:54.279]  Nothing else is even near it.
[01:05:54.419 --> 01:06:00.164]  Get TurboForce today at InfoWarsLive.com, but I recommend you only take half a dose the first time.
[01:06:00.284 --> 01:06:02.146]  Beware the power of TurboForce!
[01:06:05.057 --> 01:06:05.958]  You got it.
[01:06:06.138 --> 01:06:11.886]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:11.946 --> 01:06:14.068]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:18.233]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.334 --> 01:06:22.018]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:25.058 --> 01:06:26.921]  Alan Dershowitz says Trump is the target.
[01:06:27.081 --> 01:06:27.562]  Yeah.
[01:06:28.263 --> 01:06:32.910]  Mueller, Comey, Rosenstein all lied to Congress and said Trump wasn't the target.
[01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.671]  They lied.
[01:06:33.711 --> 01:06:34.372]  He was the target.
[01:06:34.412 --> 01:06:35.273]  They did wear wires.
[01:06:35.774 --> 01:06:36.455]  Trump's a patriot.
[01:06:36.475 --> 01:06:37.677]  They're the ones in the Russian payroll.
[01:06:38.197 --> 01:06:40.881]  Roger Stone was on with us for 25 minutes at the start of the show.
[01:06:42.097 --> 01:06:49.421]  He told me earlier, they came in, grabbed the phone away, the courthouse said there's thousands out there, it's too dangerous, they're too angry, get out there, repeat all that.
[01:06:49.721 --> 01:06:58.105]  So Roger Stone goes out, he did a great job, but they drowned him out mainly, they had to end the press conference, media just shouting questions incoherently, you all saw the footage.
[01:06:58.665 --> 01:07:02.627]  So now Roger Stone, thanks to info we're still existing, we're supposed to already be gone.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.363]  I can't tell you the stuff they've done behind the scenes and publicly, but they have fought like the devil to try to take us down.
[01:07:08.383 --> 01:07:13.967]  But thanks to you, listeners, and thanks to your prayers and your support, we are still here.
[01:07:14.067 --> 01:07:18.070]  And Roger is still here when he'll tell you the only place to support him was in full force.
[01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:20.551]  Even though it put an albatross around my neck.
[01:07:20.611 --> 01:07:22.633]  Hey, I already put that thing on before I ever met Roger.
[01:07:22.913 --> 01:07:29.197]  So, Roger, you've got the floor right now to lay out exactly what happened and then have your statement.
[01:07:29.217 --> 01:07:33.720]  And then what happened with that howling crowd of so-called press trying to silence you?
[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:48.724]  Alright, well, so to pick up the narrative, they then, the FBI, told me they had a warrant to search my home, to seize all my computers, my cell phone, my iPad, so on.
[01:07:49.264 --> 01:07:56.746]  They also had warrants to seize the InfoWare studio, which is in Oakland Park, and to inspect
[01:07:58.889 --> 01:08:02.712]  Uh, my apartment in New York, uh, they showed up at both of those locations.
[01:08:03.332 --> 01:08:10.337]  They did ask for the key for the InfoWars studio, so they didn't have to break the door down, which I gave them.
[01:08:10.898 --> 01:08:12.139]  There's nothing there to find.
[01:08:12.659 --> 01:08:22.506]  See, the irony of this, of course, is that they're searching for records they already have, since we know they have been monitoring my email, text messages, and phone calls for over two years.
[01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:24.167]  Two and a half years.
[01:08:25.108 --> 01:08:27.569]  Uh, then, uh, they took me, still handcuffed, to, uh,
[01:08:28.914 --> 01:08:31.135]  to the FBI processing center.
[01:08:31.855 --> 01:08:41.299]  The individual FBI agents were very courteous, very respectful, got me some water, got me a protein bar, let me use the bathroom.
[01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.540]  And then I was fingerprinted.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.141]  They took mug shots.
[01:08:46.621 --> 01:08:53.304]  And then they transferred me from there to the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale, about a 40 minute drive.
[01:08:54.604 --> 01:09:01.129]  Uh, there we went into the garage because the media, um, maelstrom was beginning.
[01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:04.452]  There were probably 300 reporters there when I arrived.
[01:09:05.233 --> 01:09:06.654]  That crowd just grew.
[01:09:06.734 --> 01:09:12.699]  There was also a throng of supporters and a throng of, of, uh, protesters.
[01:09:13.739 --> 01:09:17.843]  Uh, and then, um, I was, uh, put into a holding cell.
[01:09:18.763 --> 01:09:19.424]  Oh, pardon me.
[01:09:19.444 --> 01:09:20.685]  It's not true.
[01:09:20.885 --> 01:09:23.227]  I, I was then shackled, hand and foot.
[01:09:23.885 --> 01:09:24.145]  I think so.
[01:09:49.233 --> 01:09:50.733]  They let me see my attorneys.
[01:09:51.074 --> 01:10:01.296]  My attorneys told me that the government had agreed to a bond of $250,000, but then that I would be brought before a judge.
[01:10:02.537 --> 01:10:07.618]  I went before the judge, still shackled, a room full of press but no cameras.
[01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:10.131]  It was very brief.
[01:10:10.531 --> 01:10:16.553]  The government and my lawyers both agreed to allow me a bond.
[01:10:17.173 --> 01:10:23.135]  Right now, my travel restrictions are Washington, D.C., New York City, and South Florida.
[01:10:23.955 --> 01:10:29.777]  If I want to come to Austin, which I do, I have to get permission, but my attorneys think that is doable.
[01:10:31.308 --> 01:10:33.489]  So, I am restricted in where I can go.
[01:10:33.509 --> 01:10:39.354]  I am ordered to take more substance abuse testing, which they tell me is standard.
[01:10:40.975 --> 01:10:41.816]  That's about it.
[01:10:41.936 --> 01:10:47.400]  At this moment, there is no press gag on me, but I will be brought before a magistrate.
[01:10:47.881 --> 01:10:50.603]  The thing here is, is why are they treating me like the OG?
[01:10:51.123 --> 01:10:55.066]  They're treating me like Pablo Escobar, when all they had to do was
[01:10:55.987 --> 01:10:58.808]  Well, Ross, I gotta say, you look great in a t-shirt.
[01:11:11.614 --> 01:11:14.616]  Now let's stop right there, because they don't want you to be able to speak.
[01:11:14.656 --> 01:11:23.041]  And I know what you were planning to say at the press conference after you talked about your innocence and the war on the press and how this is a war on the president, which you've accurately predicted.
[01:11:23.081 --> 01:11:23.981]  Dershowitz agrees with you.
[01:11:24.001 --> 01:11:27.363]  So let's move on to what comes next now, because they don't want you to have speech.
[01:11:27.903 --> 01:11:29.944]  They've had the press shouting you down, not just hecklers.
[01:11:30.245 --> 01:11:31.886]  Over a thousand people, more showing up.
[01:11:32.606 --> 01:11:35.267]  So for people that don't know,
[01:11:36.388 --> 01:11:36.988]  What's happening.
[01:11:37.409 --> 01:11:38.889]  Tell them what's coming next.
[01:11:38.909 --> 01:11:45.053]  You've been very very accurate and the war on the press, the things we talked about off air that you were going to say at the press conference that they stopped you from saying.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:12:02.512]  Well, what was most disconcerting about the press scrum is that some of the people were, of course, just loudmouthed left-wing demonstrators, but some of the alternative left-wing media type were, you know, shouting out, you know, did you collude with the Russians?
[01:12:02.593 --> 01:12:03.573]  Are you a Russian?
[01:12:03.593 --> 01:12:04.554]  Do you work with the Russians?
[01:12:04.614 --> 01:12:09.418]  I mean, it was really ridiculous, because anyone who's read this indictment knows that's not the case.
[01:12:10.398 --> 01:12:28.671]  And anyone that knows when, I mean this is a world exclusive, bigger than OJ, literally, three or four times the number, this is the biggest press conference hysteria I've ever seen, literally, and they won't shut up screaming, are you a Russian, are you a Russian, are you a Russian, where you can't even give a damn statement like everybody does and then takes questions.
[01:12:28.691 --> 01:12:31.513]  They ran you off rather than get questions in.
[01:12:32.234 --> 01:12:33.555]  This only went like six minutes.
[01:12:33.595 --> 01:12:34.616]  This was insane!
[01:12:35.829 --> 01:12:41.453]  Well, that's because I wanted, in all honesty, to tell the full story here at InfoWars, and it was just untenable.
[01:12:41.893 --> 01:12:44.214]  They wouldn't shut up long enough for me to take questions.
[01:12:44.695 --> 01:12:47.176]  I was barely able to make a statement, and here's what I said.
[01:12:47.857 --> 01:12:52.740]  After two years of intense scrutiny, this is what the government comes up with.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:59.444]  No Russian collusion, no WikiLeaks collaboration, no legal act regarding the 2016 election.
[01:12:59.564 --> 01:13:02.926]  All process crimes fabricated, manufactured,
[01:13:04.967 --> 01:13:09.389]  I'm accused of being less than truthful in my testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.
[01:13:09.969 --> 01:13:10.810]  That's just false.
[01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:14.672]  To the extent that I've made errors, they're inconsequential.
[01:13:14.732 --> 01:13:16.673]  They're not material to anything.
[01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:18.894]  They don't hide anything.
[01:13:18.934 --> 01:13:22.556]  They would be honest errors of memory.
[01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:25.401]  And in one case, they're absolutely right.
[01:13:25.481 --> 01:13:31.984]  I did forget text messages that were entirely exculpatory and proved that everything I had told them was true.
[01:13:32.004 --> 01:13:41.728]  So, you know, Adam Schiff and Eric Swallow as well and their allies put ungodly pressure on Robert Mueller to bring this indictment.
[01:13:42.588 --> 01:13:43.129]  And they did.
[01:13:43.489 --> 01:13:45.531]  These are crumped up, phony charges.
[01:13:46.031 --> 01:13:47.913]  I haven't intimidated any witnesses.
[01:13:48.033 --> 01:13:49.534]  I haven't obstructed justice.
[01:13:50.035 --> 01:13:51.376]  I did not work with the Russians.
[01:13:51.476 --> 01:13:56.560]  And this has nothing to do with Donald Trump, other than the fact that you asked me what the next step is.
[01:13:56.580 --> 01:13:58.161]  The next step, I think, is pretty clear.
[01:13:58.822 --> 01:14:03.606]  This is where they promised to go light on me if I'll just help them nail Donald Trump.
[01:14:04.086 --> 01:14:06.248]  That's the next step, and that's not going to happen.
[01:14:07.315 --> 01:14:13.880]  Well, I hate to raise this, but they're encamped at your house, digging over everything, hoping to find a crooked toenail or something, nothing related to Russia.
[01:14:15.141 --> 01:14:18.403]  I said last night, I said, I hope they don't put you into the jail like, like, you know, Manafort.
[01:14:19.805 --> 01:14:30.393]  So, so, you know, looking into the eyes of history, looking into real destiny here, Roger, what do you expect them to do next week when you're arraigned in D.C.? ?
[01:14:31.536 --> 01:14:37.417]  Well, I'll have a statement then, because I believe when you are falsely accused, it's vitally important that you respond.
[01:14:38.757 --> 01:14:43.458]  And I know InfoWars will be there to cover it, so I know that people will hear what I actually have to say.
[01:14:45.019 --> 01:14:52.600]  I'll be available for the war room today, although we have our veteran show, so people can get a blow-by-blow of what happened.
[01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.281]  Do we have Friday veterans call-ins?
[01:14:55.301 --> 01:14:57.061]  I think they'll understand it's preempted today.
[01:14:59.346 --> 01:15:00.166]  Yes, we're going to print that.
[01:15:00.226 --> 01:15:04.528]  Roger, I can tell people are talking to you and telling you to go, but this is a world exclusive.
[01:15:04.928 --> 01:15:06.148]  They've tried to silence you.
[01:15:06.428 --> 01:15:10.169]  I want you to just hold on for five more minutes on the side and then pop in on the war room today.
[01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:11.810]  I know you're very exhausted.
[01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:13.110]  You've been up since 5 a.m.
[01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:14.170]  when the SWAT team raided you.
[01:15:14.671 --> 01:15:18.792]  But just now and going to break, what does the president need to do?
[01:15:18.852 --> 01:15:20.452]  This is beyond McCarthyism now.
[01:15:20.472 --> 01:15:22.153]  None of this is Russiagate.
[01:15:22.193 --> 01:15:25.434]  It's run by a guy who gives uranium to Russians on tarmacs.
[01:15:25.474 --> 01:15:26.994]  His name ought to be Vlad Muller.
[01:15:27.394 --> 01:15:28.975]  I mean, what the hell's going on here?
[01:15:34.164 --> 01:15:35.385]  And they grabbed the phone away again.
[01:15:36.325 --> 01:15:36.806]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:15:37.026 --> 01:15:37.626]  Oh, you're there.
[01:15:37.706 --> 01:15:37.826]  OK.
[01:15:37.886 --> 01:15:38.907]  There's so much call waiting.
[01:15:38.927 --> 01:15:39.688]  Roger, don't hang up.
[01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:40.808]  You've got to go to break.
[01:15:40.848 --> 01:15:41.188]  No, I didn't.
[01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:43.290]  I moved to a different room so I could get more quiet.
[01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.690]  No, it's OK.
[01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:44.090]  Go ahead.
[01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:46.172]  We're going to go to break, my friend.
[01:15:46.192 --> 01:15:46.912]  I'll talk to you during the break.
[01:15:46.952 --> 01:15:47.372]  Don't hang up.
[01:15:47.392 --> 01:15:48.013]  Come back.
[01:15:48.113 --> 01:15:49.434]  One more segment, global exclusive.
[01:15:49.734 --> 01:15:51.315]  Think of all the things we talk about off air.
[01:15:51.355 --> 01:15:53.016]  You're so interesting off air, on air, too.
[01:15:53.496 --> 01:15:57.939]  All the things you want to say, because they don't, especially next week you go in, they might throw you into the jail.
[01:15:58.379 --> 01:16:00.281]  So what does Roger want the world to know really happened?
[01:16:00.301 --> 01:16:00.661]  Stay with us.
[01:16:03.443 --> 01:16:07.644]  Imagine if Infowars hadn't been here to expose global government.
[01:16:08.465 --> 01:16:12.446]  To expose their plan to implode national sovereignty and nation's borders.
[01:16:13.566 --> 01:16:21.288]  Imagine if the lights had been turned off all those years and the incredibly important topics we talk about hadn't been discussed.
[01:16:22.868 --> 01:16:26.489]  But it's because of you doing that over the years that we're here.
[01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:29.850]  And that's not some platitude, that's not some pat on the back.
[01:16:31.075 --> 01:16:36.959]  That is the humble recognition that you are the sea on which all of us sail.
[01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.220]  I'm the sea.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:39.981]  You're the sea.
[01:16:40.541 --> 01:16:41.101]  I'm the wind.
[01:16:42.702 --> 01:16:43.363]  You're the wind.
[01:16:43.483 --> 01:16:45.824]  We are all the sails together in this.
[01:16:45.884 --> 01:16:53.689]  But if you hadn't resonated with what we talked about and what we did, if you hadn't prayed for us and spread the word and supported us, we wouldn't be here.
[01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:56.051]  If you hadn't been faithful,
[01:16:57.665 --> 01:17:08.108]  In our shared destiny together, we wouldn't have already had these successes and nationalism exploding across the world, and all the incredible positive things happening that have unfolded.
[01:17:09.808 --> 01:17:11.028]  But because of you, we've done that.
[01:17:11.949 --> 01:17:12.689]  There's an equation.
[01:17:13.749 --> 01:17:18.830]  If you spread the word about InfoWars, and the articles, the videos, the links, we get around the enemy.
[01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:21.431]  And if you fund
[01:17:22.694 --> 01:17:25.576]  The information we're producing, it all comes together.
[01:17:26.216 --> 01:17:28.177]  But it comes down to that, chicken or the egg.
[01:17:29.158 --> 01:17:39.784]  If you don't fund the seed money to keep Infowars on the air and to fight against the fake lawsuits and the attacks of Soros and Hillary and others, we won't have the information to put on air for all of you to spread.
[01:17:40.644 --> 01:17:47.748]  So each one is just as important, but the most critical point the enemy understands is cutting the funding off.
[01:17:49.069 --> 01:17:52.171]  They don't want to have us be live on air while all this unfolds.
[01:17:53.663 --> 01:17:59.506]  They don't want to have us be here while the globalists push their entire world government agenda and everything we've talked about comes true.
[01:18:00.026 --> 01:18:06.310]  They don't want us here where they try to assassinate nationalist and populist leaders and while they overrun Christian countries with radical Islamists.
[01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:07.510]  They want us off the air.
[01:18:09.531 --> 01:18:12.633]  And that's why I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[01:18:13.033 --> 01:18:16.855]  If I give up, if I back down, if I waver, it's a big victory for the globalists.
[01:18:17.696 --> 01:18:21.098]  And if you back down, if you waver, it's a big victory for them as well.
[01:18:22.307 --> 01:18:25.068]  It's truly a life and death struggle.
[01:18:25.649 --> 01:18:27.210]  So all I'm going to say in closing is this.
[01:18:28.210 --> 01:18:29.651]  Our destinies are bound forever.
[01:18:31.252 --> 01:18:31.392]  And...
[01:18:33.092 --> 01:18:37.294]  Doing something this epic almost feels sick to say, hey, come give me your money.
[01:18:38.095 --> 01:18:39.676]  But you've seen what I've done with your money.
[01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:43.058]  I have waged war, fearlessly and tirelessly.
[01:18:43.198 --> 01:18:44.919]  I have dominated globalists.
[01:18:44.999 --> 01:18:46.439]  I have overrun their emplacements.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:51.522]  We have spread the message of liberty in 1776 worldwide, and we are committed to that destiny.
[01:18:52.002 --> 01:18:54.624]  And so with pride, I tell you, financially support us.
[01:18:55.364 --> 01:18:59.406]  Any other war chief in a fight for freedom would just say, support me, give me the funding now.
[01:18:59.426 --> 01:18:59.987]  I say,
[01:19:01.499 --> 01:19:07.282]  Get products of the best out there, win-win situation, fund us, and we're going to stop altogether.
[01:19:07.842 --> 01:19:11.184]  If we don't do that, there's no future, and we have no shared destiny.
[01:19:12.205 --> 01:19:19.669]  I'm very sad that Supermill Vitality, our flagship product, is no longer available when this sells out, because we can't get the wild, crafted herbs.
[01:19:20.169 --> 01:19:24.612]  The process it goes through is so organic, like making of wine, that it can't be produced anymore.
[01:19:25.372 --> 01:19:26.473]  So that's why it's the last run.
[01:19:27.483 --> 01:19:32.730]  It's available 50% off, even though it's our last run, at m4shore.com because I want you to experience it before it's gone.
[01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:40.968]  But whatever you do, pray for InfoWars, spread the articles, spread the links, spread the videos, because without you, we are going to basically be destroyed.
[01:19:41.468 --> 01:19:44.070]  But with your support, together we all go into the future.
[01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:53.055]  Whatever you do, just remember that the power of you, via word of mouth, speaking out and taking action, is the most powerful thing in the universe, next to God.
[01:19:53.816 --> 01:20:01.300]  And for your support, and your undying prayers, I thank you, and I salute you, but more importantly, we are bound, and I love you.
[01:20:01.841 --> 01:20:02.241]  So thank you.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:18.366]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.887 --> 01:20:25.170]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:33.335]  You know, I learned 30-plus years ago from their own documents that a group of multinational corporations
[01:20:34.804 --> 01:20:41.345]  Allied with the Chi-Coms and others, plan to take over every free nation in the world and turn us into tyrannies.
[01:20:42.545 --> 01:20:44.146]  And I began to fight it 25 years ago.
[01:20:45.566 --> 01:20:48.226]  All over the world now, nationalists and patriots are getting elected.
[01:20:49.507 --> 01:20:52.007]  And everywhere they're being elected, they turn the tide of tyranny.
[01:20:52.607 --> 01:20:54.147]  But then the deep state tries to indict them.
[01:20:55.087 --> 01:20:56.868]  Roger Stone was the chief advisor to Trump.
[01:20:56.888 --> 01:21:00.288]  He got him to run exploratory in 2000, again in 2014 or so for 2016.
[01:21:05.137 --> 01:21:18.126]  He's been targeted for two and a half years with this BS, so have I. We've laughed about it a lot until it got down to the wire, that trying to talk to WikiLeaks is criminal and Russian collusion when they're not even Russian.
[01:21:18.746 --> 01:21:22.508]  And all the rest of the media could talk to him, including the Washington Post, the New York Times, CNN.
[01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:33.796]  And now, CNN's camped outside his house, gets the tip, they're there, 29 SWAT team raid, and then Roger gets out, goes and gives a press conference after he talks to us exclusively,
[01:21:35.563 --> 01:21:39.126]  And there's so many reporters screaming, you're a Russian, you're a Russian, you can't hear anything.
[01:21:40.267 --> 01:21:44.510]  Because obviously they all got there to shout him down so that he wouldn't get a statement.
[01:21:44.530 --> 01:21:46.912]  Well, you're going to get his statement here right now.
[01:21:46.952 --> 01:21:50.134]  What he thinks the president should do, where this country's going.
[01:21:50.194 --> 01:21:53.917]  Dershowitz is now saying the sky's blue and warning the president that he is the target.
[01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:55.538]  This is made up.
[01:21:55.999 --> 01:21:57.720]  Appoint a special prosecutor.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.563]  You keep, you've got the president's ear right now more than ever, Roger.
[01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:02.844]  Your 44 years of friendship.
[01:22:03.304 --> 01:22:04.906]  The White House is watching right now, Roger.
[01:22:05.805 --> 01:22:07.887]  Specifically, what's happening big picture?
[01:22:07.987 --> 01:22:09.128]  What does the President need to do?
[01:22:09.449 --> 01:22:12.031]  What does America need to do to understand the real threat we face?
[01:22:12.472 --> 01:22:15.134]  The Deep State's taking down the First Amendment and everything right now.
[01:22:16.135 --> 01:22:25.864]  Well, I think they demonstrated today that they treat the President's advisors, they treat the President's friends like gangsters.
[01:22:26.505 --> 01:22:30.369]  I did not expect to wake up and be looking down the barrel with two guns this morning.
[01:22:31.235 --> 01:22:31.935]  We're good to go.
[01:22:50.583 --> 01:22:55.527]  To examine the FISA warrants, he needs to declassify them immediately.
[01:22:56.247 --> 01:23:03.693]  That, I think, brings the whole globalist Obama-Clinton house of cards down.
[01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:16.163]  It is the single most important thing that he can do, and then it will give a special counsel of his appointment, of the new Attorney General's appointment, or even the acting Attorney General's appointment, a roadmap.
[01:23:16.183 --> 01:23:18.625]  And that roadmap needs to be followed.
[01:23:19.425 --> 01:23:30.192]  There's no doubt in my mind that this isn't about Roger Schoen, other than the fact that this indictment is so dead, so incorrect, has so many distortions in it.
[01:23:30.252 --> 01:23:32.013]  My lawyers are aghast.
[01:23:32.053 --> 01:23:39.298]  First of all, they're aghast that they weren't called, that CNN knew of my arrest before they did, which is unheard of.
[01:23:39.959 --> 01:23:40.419]  Unheard of!
[01:23:41.039 --> 01:23:44.942]  They actually put out a press release prior to my lawyers being notified.
[01:23:45.515 --> 01:23:45.655]  Sure.
[01:24:18.138 --> 01:24:21.781]  I have no stocks, no bonds, no real estate.
[01:24:22.421 --> 01:24:26.324]  You know, thank God for InfoWars, because you guys have kept me alive.
[01:24:27.365 --> 01:24:30.288]  I have a couple other very small gigs, but not much.
[01:24:30.728 --> 01:24:36.893]  Facebook and their war of censorship against InfoWars and against me has really hurt my book sales.
[01:24:37.713 --> 01:24:44.379]  So the idea is to put you under such intense financial pressure
[01:24:44.867 --> 01:24:51.869]  You're forced to plead guilty to something you didn't do, and then in turn, to turn on President Michael Cohen-style.
[01:24:52.355 --> 01:24:54.557]  And let's be clear, let's be clear, let's be clear.
[01:24:55.397 --> 01:24:57.839]  You make that statement, but they're making their move now.
[01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.080]  They're going to move on the president.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.521]  Dershowitz is smart.
[01:25:00.861 --> 01:25:01.561]  He's admitted it.
[01:25:01.942 --> 01:25:03.042]  But let's just talk about this.
[01:25:03.503 --> 01:25:04.723]  They need us to be the demons.
[01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:08.666]  They need somebody to say, OK, we're Russians when there's no proof.
[01:25:09.046 --> 01:25:09.947]  And again, nothing here.
[01:25:09.987 --> 01:25:17.072]  So that's why if people support InfoWarStore.com, if they support, because I support you, if they support Stone Defense Fund,
[01:25:19.553 --> 01:25:20.653]  This is the revolution.
[01:25:20.693 --> 01:25:22.934]  This is 1776 Part 2.
[01:25:23.794 --> 01:25:25.935]  This is standing against the whole system.
[01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:32.558]  So yes, everyone should send a strong message at StoneDefenseFund.com and go make donations there right now.
[01:25:32.578 --> 01:25:39.941]  And everyone should go to InfoWarsTore.com and get your books and get your t-shirt because part of that proceeds goes to you because as you know, Roger,
[01:25:41.058 --> 01:25:42.179]  We're next in the hopper.
[01:25:42.619 --> 01:25:51.143]  We told everybody they were going to try to frame my dad for hush money because Corsi signed a contract where he'd get paid out unless it was for cause.
[01:25:52.082 --> 01:25:56.785]  So to be nice, we paid out the last six months of his contract that just so happens to end in January.
[01:25:57.045 --> 01:25:59.546]  That's when it was signed two years ago, so it's rented every year.
[01:25:59.866 --> 01:26:03.949]  And I've got my phone ringing off the hook like, are you going to jail next for your hush money?
[01:26:03.989 --> 01:26:07.151]  So now paying your reporters is hush money.
[01:26:07.211 --> 01:26:11.073]  I mean, these people are going for broke, but put them on the defense.
[01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:19.559]  They're in Uranium One, hundreds of millions from the Russians, Mueller at Tarmac, Uranium, the foundations, the kidnapped kids in Haiti.
[01:26:19.919 --> 01:26:22.821]  I mean, Trump doesn't ever go on the offense.
[01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:25.763]  And it's insane as they creep up towards him.
[01:26:25.783 --> 01:26:29.546]  Your emergency message to the President, again, what are you saying to the President right now?
[01:26:30.186 --> 01:26:36.653]  Appoint a special counsel immediately to investigate Uranium One and the crimes of the Clintons and the Obamas.
[01:26:37.174 --> 01:26:40.217]  Secondarily, declassify all of the documents.
[01:26:40.617 --> 01:26:46.404]  Who else was subject to an illegal, unconstitutional FISA warrant besides Carter Page?
[01:26:46.764 --> 01:26:49.387]  Because I believe that I was subject to one.
[01:26:50.508 --> 01:26:53.371]  Get to the bottom of who has been surveilled.
[01:26:53.771 --> 01:27:03.902]  Alex, there's no doubt that they've come for me, and I really believe they are coming for you, based on this trumped-up nonsense coming from Jerry Corsi and... Well, let's be clear.
[01:27:05.023 --> 01:27:09.830]  Michael Caputo and others a year and a half ago, or a year ago, got asked about Alex Jones.
[01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:10.711]  We never made that up.
[01:27:10.731 --> 01:27:12.433]  You think I want to be in the crosshairs of this?
[01:27:12.934 --> 01:27:14.436]  It just shows how asinine it is.
[01:27:14.516 --> 01:27:22.667]  Now I'm the Russian agent, and if they find something to indict me for made up, it won't be Russia again, because everyone knows I bleed red, white, and blue.
[01:27:23.946 --> 01:27:25.127]  It's an absurdity.
[01:27:25.147 --> 01:27:30.849]  Look, I'm a guy who had family members mowed down by Russian tanks in Budapest in 1956.
[01:27:30.929 --> 01:27:34.951]  I hate the Russians and their system.
[01:27:35.111 --> 01:27:41.593]  I'm a patriotic American, so accusing me of collusion with the Russians is about the greatest single insult you could have.
[01:27:42.094 --> 01:27:51.277]  You're married to the daughter of a famous Cuban capitalist and fighter, and you help round up a bunch of Russians in the 80s for Reagan.
[01:27:51.317 --> 01:27:52.498]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:27:53.409 --> 01:27:55.331]  Exactly, which is why I intend to fight.
[01:27:55.411 --> 01:27:56.532]  I will fight these charges.
[01:27:57.193 --> 01:27:58.674]  This is what they would let me say today.
[01:27:58.914 --> 01:27:59.575]  I am innocent.
[01:28:00.035 --> 01:28:01.977]  These charges are bogus.
[01:28:02.017 --> 01:28:03.479]  They are fabricated.
[01:28:04.019 --> 01:28:05.721]  None of them relate to Russian collusion.
[01:28:05.781 --> 01:28:09.264]  None of them relate to any collaboration with the WikiLeaks.
[01:28:09.624 --> 01:28:18.593]  The idea that you or I, or anyone we know, got documents from WikiLeaks and gave them to the Trump campaign is categorically false.
[01:28:19.533 --> 01:28:23.794]  This is a political indictment as part of a political witch hunt.
[01:28:24.934 --> 01:28:26.074]  And I will not bend.
[01:28:26.194 --> 01:28:27.155]  I will not falter.
[01:28:27.315 --> 01:28:28.335]  I will not fold.
[01:28:28.375 --> 01:28:30.115]  And I'm not going to testify against Trump.
[01:28:30.615 --> 01:28:36.617]  Roger, I know you've got five lawyers and literally 50 chase cars chasing you wherever you went to.
[01:28:37.057 --> 01:28:38.557]  We need you on The War Room today.
[01:28:39.317 --> 01:28:41.118]  The whole world wants to distort what you said.
[01:28:41.158 --> 01:28:42.018]  They tried to boo you.
[01:28:42.058 --> 01:28:43.298]  They tried to block you from having a speech.
[01:28:43.338 --> 01:28:44.798]  You have it here for now.
[01:28:44.838 --> 01:28:47.759]  Thanks to the listeners supporting us and building this platform to fight.
[01:28:48.519 --> 01:28:49.739]  Now in America's Darkest Hours.
[01:28:49.799 --> 01:28:55.441]  So, promise me that you'll pop in at the start of the War Room, 3 o'clock Central, 4 o'clock Eastern today, okay?
[01:28:56.481 --> 01:28:58.802]  Uh, probably be 5 o'clock, my normal clock.
[01:28:59.562 --> 01:29:00.362]  Okay, perfect.
[01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:01.562]  Let me talk to you during the break, though.
[01:29:01.582 --> 01:29:01.902]  Stay there.
[01:29:02.342 --> 01:29:02.983]  Know someone?
[01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:13.025]  We've spent two years
[01:29:14.710 --> 01:29:24.256]  And had to pay top formulators and scientists from the top labs in the country to make what they believed was the best energy drink replacement.
[01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:50.557]  I said, what would happen if we sold something for $50 and it had $20 of product in it?
[01:29:50.577 --> 01:29:53.160]  And they said, that's not even done.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.001]  That's impossible.
[01:29:55.171 --> 01:29:56.672]  It's just not, it's not done.
[01:29:56.992 --> 01:29:58.813]  So you have to understand how my brain works.
[01:29:58.873 --> 01:30:01.335]  How, how, how, how I operate.
[01:30:01.615 --> 01:30:09.159]  I said, I want the strongest, most powerful, cleanest, healthiest system with all of the key upload enzymes in it.
[01:30:09.259 --> 01:30:22.847]  Because the body, it doesn't matter how much energy drink you drink after a while, it depletes vitamins and minerals and cofactors and key chemicals that are needed to actually get it through the blood, through the blood-brain barrier, and to the cells in a healthy way without the crash.
[01:30:23.467 --> 01:30:26.430]  So imagine if there was an energy drink without the crash.
[01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:30.974]  Imagine if there was an energy drink without the toxicity and the sugar and all the garbage.
[01:30:31.415 --> 01:30:38.361]  Imagine if there was an energy drink that actually had everything that was really a vitamin and mineral fusion with everything else.
[01:30:38.401 --> 01:30:39.682]  Well, we've done it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:39.802 --> 01:30:42.445]  And I'll tell you right now that it is next level.
[01:30:42.645 --> 01:30:43.246]  TurboForce.
[01:30:43.526 --> 01:30:49.291]  Energy, metabolism, alertness, and if you look at the back of the box, it goes into everything it's got, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:49.411 --> 01:30:59.641]  And it's got the herbal energy blend that are all these different types of naturally occurring systems within chemicals that are naturally occurring in the plants to help upload it naturally.
[01:30:59.781 --> 01:31:00.341]  And it's all there.
[01:31:00.501 --> 01:31:06.287]  This is someone going to a bunch of top research, we went to four different groups, and saying, give us your plan of the
[01:31:06.687 --> 01:31:10.710]  Next level muscle car in natural, healthy energy.
[01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:15.133]  And again, Brain Force Plus is mainly a nootropic with a little bit of clean energy.
[01:31:15.193 --> 01:31:15.813]  People love it.
[01:31:15.953 --> 01:31:20.356]  This is ultimate pre-workout, but ultimate start your day or take in the middle of the day.
[01:31:20.576 --> 01:31:26.520]  I quite frankly, Brain Force works so good on me, I can barely take it, but I need to stay up all night because it goes to and pop one at 10 o'clock at night.
[01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:27.241]  I'm good at midnight.
[01:31:27.301 --> 01:31:27.861]  I'm up all night.
[01:31:27.961 --> 01:31:29.802]  And then I go to sleep and don't crash from it the next day.
[01:31:29.902 --> 01:31:34.224]  So this complements Brain Force Plus, but this is a packet form.
[01:31:34.404 --> 01:31:40.106]  And quite frankly, I said make it one of the strongest out there on the market, but make it clean and make it good.
[01:31:41.267 --> 01:31:44.909]  Most people, I would suggest you take a quarter packet the first time you take it.
[01:31:44.969 --> 01:31:52.192]  Because when we got prototypes of this a few months ago, man, everyone was bouncing off the walls and we can't even believe this is legal.
[01:31:52.372 --> 01:31:54.273]  Bouncing off the walls.
[01:31:54.533 --> 01:31:59.135]  Because it has a spectrum of every natural form of caffeine there is.
[01:31:59.315 --> 01:32:04.558]  But stuff that has a 4-hour burn rate, a 3-hour burn rate, a 2-hour burn rate, a 1-hour burn rate.
[01:32:04.658 --> 01:32:09.901]  It's got all of these different enzymes that upload it so you get a way bigger response.
[01:32:10.101 --> 01:32:10.821]  I think this is good.
[01:32:11.361 --> 01:32:12.042]  And I'm proud of it.
[01:32:12.602 --> 01:32:14.384]  And you'll use it responsibly.
[01:32:14.744 --> 01:32:18.969]  But I said, give us the most powerful, clean, healthy thing, but in this genre.
[01:32:19.069 --> 01:32:21.091]  And I cannot believe we even produced this.
[01:32:21.191 --> 01:32:22.993]  I mean, this is insane.

[01:32:26.797 --> 01:32:29.200]  Why don't you get up in the morning and try this instead of your coffee?
[01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:33.161]  It's hard to even get into why this is so good, because there's so many ingredients.
[01:32:33.361 --> 01:32:35.442]  I mean, there's just a ton of ingredients in this, baby.
[01:32:35.582 --> 01:32:36.402]  A ton of ingredients.
[01:32:36.422 --> 01:32:39.323]  This took two years to develop, and it's to the moon without a rocket.

[01:32:44.845 --> 01:32:45.505]  No reviews yet.
[01:32:45.525 --> 01:32:45.505]  $39.95.
[01:32:45.545 --> 01:32:47.046]  Blows away everything on the planet.
[01:32:47.166 --> 01:32:48.506]  This is the ultimate.
[01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:10.896]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:27.804 --> 01:33:28.725]  President Trump.
[01:33:30.066 --> 01:33:31.746]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:32.167 --> 01:33:33.707]  Because there is a war on.
[01:33:34.148 --> 01:33:35.028]  Or you're mine.
[01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:43.972]  Well, the corporate media is everywhere announcing that they're going to have the first exclusive with Roger Stone.
[01:33:43.992 --> 01:33:45.812]  Because InfoWars, we don't exist.
[01:33:46.673 --> 01:33:53.255]  Except with our millions of listeners that are going to get the word out and share these videos, because this is now them making the move on the president.
[01:33:53.295 --> 01:33:53.775]  This is it.
[01:33:55.742 --> 01:34:00.826]  The president came out, he's already compromised once on DACA, which he did a year ago and they said no to.
[01:34:01.786 --> 01:34:03.968]  And now he's saying even more compromise and they're refusing.
[01:34:04.588 --> 01:34:14.095]  But they're claiming they've come to a short interim temporary government shutdown restart.
[01:34:14.535 --> 01:34:15.196]  That's coming up.
[01:34:15.296 --> 01:34:20.220]  We've got one of his lawyers, Tyler Nixon, very smart guy, popping in here in a moment.
[01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:24.302]  We've also got some of the reporters that were there today covering this.
[01:34:24.322 --> 01:34:24.723]  But Roger,
[01:34:26.058 --> 01:34:34.380]  They fought hard at your press conference to block you out and scream you're a Russian agent, including a lot of the press, the so-called media, who are now murderers of the truth.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.481]  So this is your chance to encapsulate it all in like three, four minutes.
[01:34:39.061 --> 01:34:42.021]  And I'm going to run this every day for the next two weeks so people know the truth.
[01:34:42.321 --> 01:34:47.703]  Because next week, like Paul Manafort, you could disappear into a spider hole, which I hope doesn't happen because I'm next.
[01:34:47.743 --> 01:34:48.763]  We're all in this together, brother.
[01:34:50.461 --> 01:34:57.144]  Here's your chance to the President, the world, everybody, while InfoWars is still standing, bleeding, but in the fight.
[01:34:58.385 --> 01:35:05.048]  Thanks to the prayers of our supporters, here's your chance to communicate your statement about the war on the press, the war on your family.
[01:35:05.489 --> 01:35:06.889]  There's no Russia collusion in this.
[01:35:06.969 --> 01:35:07.830]  It's so insane.
[01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:10.631]  They're trying to put you in prison for decades for being a journalist.
[01:35:10.931 --> 01:35:12.052]  The indictment is insane.
[01:35:12.632 --> 01:35:14.753]  What does it all signify, Roger Stone?
[01:35:15.594 --> 01:35:17.795]  Well, Alex, America is under attack.
[01:35:18.631 --> 01:35:20.237]  InfoWars is under attack.
[01:35:20.518 --> 01:35:22.185]  I am under personal attack.
[01:35:23.312 --> 01:35:34.461]  In order to weaken me, they spread lies about the settlement of a lawsuit weeks ago, pushing the headline, Roger Stone admits pushing lies on InfoWars, which is not what I said.
[01:35:34.481 --> 01:35:42.667]  In fact, I'll be very clear, I've never reported anything at InfoWars or any other platform that I didn't believe to be true at the time I reported it.
[01:35:43.268 --> 01:35:48.352]  That was an effort to shape my credibility with the public as a setup for what happened today.
[01:35:49.506 --> 01:35:51.187]  They want to treat me like a gangster.
[01:35:51.247 --> 01:35:52.529]  They think I'm the OG.
[01:35:53.710 --> 01:35:59.856]  They could have just called my lawyers and I would have voluntarily surrendered wearing a suit and tie.
[01:35:59.916 --> 01:36:06.843]  Instead, they kick in the door of my house at 5 o'clock in the morning, 5.50, guns drawn.
[01:36:07.384 --> 01:36:11.008]  They handcuff me like I'm a drug dealer.
[01:36:11.928 --> 01:36:36.182]  They pump up completely fabricated, non-Russian collusion, no WikiLeaks collaboration, no evidence of any crime that pertains to the election of Donald Trump in the 2015 election, allegations pushed by Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell that I was less than truthful in my House Intelligence Committee testimony, which I was not.
[01:36:36.722 --> 01:36:47.411]  To the extent that I've made any errors, it would be honest errors of memory, and it would be irrelevant, I mean, inconsequential, immaterial, as the law would require for a perjury charge.
[01:36:48.012 --> 01:37:00.642]  What they did to me today was an effort to intimidate me, to humiliate me, putting me in shackles in the federal courthouse, parading me in front of a courtroom full of reporters.
[01:37:01.543 --> 01:37:02.484]  But I won't bend.
[01:37:02.504 --> 01:37:03.765]  I won't break.
[01:37:04.634 --> 01:37:05.715]  I won't fade.
[01:37:05.735 --> 01:37:06.737]  I won't quit.
[01:37:07.438 --> 01:37:13.585]  I'm not going to testify against Donald Trump and make up lies as they suggest to ease the pressure on myself.
[01:37:13.905 --> 01:37:15.127]  I will fight these charges.
[01:37:15.783 --> 01:37:17.244]  I have excellent lawyers.
[01:37:17.804 --> 01:37:20.166]  I have my deep belief in God.
[01:37:20.186 --> 01:37:25.008]  I have the strong support of not only my family, but the InfoWars family.
[01:37:25.549 --> 01:37:28.870]  I do need people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:37:29.431 --> 01:37:33.173]  My lawyers project that my defense can cost as much as $2 million.
[01:37:33.493 --> 01:37:37.155]  Right now, I'm struggling to pay the rent, to pay my taxes.
[01:37:37.175 --> 01:37:38.616]  I had to sell my car.
[01:37:39.537 --> 01:37:41.279]  I lost my health and life insurance.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:53.152]  You know, it is part of their plan to squeeze you financially, to make you plead guilty to something you didn't do, and to try to leverage you to testify against our great president.
[01:37:53.672 --> 01:37:55.054]  I'm just not going to do that.
[01:37:55.154 --> 01:38:02.799]  It's called siege, so America's fighting for its life, and all these so-called fake journalists cheerleading, shutting down your speech at the press conference, they should be ashamed of themselves.
[01:38:02.819 --> 01:38:04.960]  They're not journalists, they're killers of the truth now.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.985]  That's their new job, and America is falling to real tyranny if the president doesn't take action, appoint the special counsel in Uranium One, and so much more.
[01:38:13.405 --> 01:38:16.706]  StoneDefenseFund.com, StoneColdTruth.com.
[01:38:17.086 --> 01:38:19.687]  Everybody buy a t-shirt, buy a stone rock, whatever.
[01:38:19.767 --> 01:38:20.728]  I know what this war is like.
[01:38:20.768 --> 01:38:25.069]  It takes money to fight this, and I've been particularly targeted for backing Stone because I know he's the real deal.
[01:38:25.409 --> 01:38:28.510]  But I'm honored to be here with you and other Americans to make this country great again.
[01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:30.811]  And Roger, I really, really appreciate you.
[01:38:30.871 --> 01:38:33.992]  And obviously, you'll be on The War Room today with another global exclusive.
[01:38:34.352 --> 01:38:40.614]  In the second hour, it's got to really anger the mainstream corporate media that they tried to shut you down and boo you out at that press conference.
[01:38:40.634 --> 01:38:41.615]  But I was told earlier,
[01:38:43.076 --> 01:38:44.416]  50,000 people a second.
[01:38:44.997 --> 01:38:50.200]  So when that Zeitgeist gets hit, we're hitting the live feeds and crashed our servers, but we're back up.
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.902]  It's only 5,000 new people a second hitting right now.
[01:38:53.322 --> 01:38:58.346]  So you've got millions of new listeners wanting to hear, well, this is evil devil, this horrible Russian.
[01:38:58.386 --> 01:38:59.266]  Let's hear what he's done.
[01:38:59.526 --> 01:39:00.567]  And there's nothing there, Roger.
[01:39:01.548 --> 01:39:04.270]  God bless you, Alex, and God bless everyone at InfoWars.
[01:39:04.370 --> 01:39:04.610]  All right.
[01:39:04.630 --> 01:39:05.270]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:39:05.310 --> 01:39:05.811]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:09.513]  All right.
[01:39:09.613 --> 01:39:10.434]  So, again,
[01:39:12.059 --> 01:39:15.441]  We've had Roger on today for basically an hour live.
[01:39:16.041 --> 01:39:19.783]  He had a six minute press conference that they bullied and shut down in front of everyone.
[01:39:21.083 --> 01:39:23.124]  And I talked to him, I said, go back, was it reporters?
[01:39:23.144 --> 01:39:25.305]  He goes, yeah, they were all shouting, you're a Russian or you're a Russian.
[01:39:25.886 --> 01:39:27.406]  There's no Russian stuff in the indictment.
[01:39:27.446 --> 01:39:28.127]  It's all crap.
[01:39:29.747 --> 01:39:38.792]  So imagine in America, you've got, and I'm not just saying this, Tiger Woods, OJ Simpson, Bill Clinton, press conferences.
[01:39:40.292 --> 01:39:41.213]  I've never seen
[01:39:42.847 --> 01:39:44.648]  The police say there were 2,000 people there by the end.
[01:39:45.469 --> 01:39:46.850]  There were over 1,000 reporters.
[01:39:48.011 --> 01:39:52.634]  We were getting 50,000 unique IP addresses a second.
[01:39:53.755 --> 01:39:56.517]  And we've got some of the biggest server companies in the world.
[01:39:57.337 --> 01:39:58.578]  Our regular bandwidth bills are $500,000 a month.
[01:39:58.618 --> 01:40:00.300]  Today's going to be $500,000.
[01:40:07.461 --> 01:40:09.242]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:40:09.302 --> 01:40:13.546]  We have tens of millions tuned in just on the streams, not on radio stations right now.
[01:40:13.586 --> 01:40:15.287]  Normally it's not even a million tuned in at one time.
[01:40:15.948 --> 01:40:17.269]  So this is all going on.
[01:40:17.329 --> 01:40:18.550]  This is insane.
[01:40:19.070 --> 01:40:20.171]  And imagine the imagery.
[01:40:20.211 --> 01:40:21.932]  He comes out and they won't let him talk.
[01:40:22.233 --> 01:40:25.035]  Well, you just heard him speak and none of them are picking up what he said.
[01:40:26.038 --> 01:40:29.419]  Because that's the thing, they don't want you to actually hear what happened.
[01:40:29.759 --> 01:40:34.220]  Tyler Nixon is a great guy, one of the chief lawyers for Stone.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.061]  I asked him this morning when I first got a first statement from his lawyer there at the jail.
[01:40:38.461 --> 01:40:39.621]  His first thing was, how's my wife?
[01:40:39.681 --> 01:40:40.401]  Okay, she's okay.
[01:40:40.681 --> 01:40:45.522]  Here's my directives and information from my lawyers and get Tyler Nixon on and Alex Jones.
[01:40:46.002 --> 01:40:47.603]  Let him know, you know, this information.
[01:40:47.943 --> 01:40:49.743]  So we put a statement out that's on Infowars.com.
[01:40:49.763 --> 01:40:50.603]  That was the first statement.
[01:40:51.003 --> 01:40:53.904]  I had ABC, CBS, NBC, Washington Post calling.
[01:40:54.184 --> 01:40:55.405]  Is that really, Roger?
[01:40:55.645 --> 01:40:58.326]  I mean, how do we even know you to... Oh, he only works here.
[01:40:58.887 --> 01:40:59.867]  That's how they operate.
[01:40:59.907 --> 01:41:01.929]  Like, everything we do is fake when they're the fake ones.
[01:41:02.849 --> 01:41:04.350]  And I'm battling for Infowars' very life.
[01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:06.631]  So, Tyler Nixon joins us.
[01:41:06.731 --> 01:41:08.493]  One of Roger's... He's actually a spokesperson.
[01:41:08.513 --> 01:41:08.933]  He wanted on.
[01:41:08.953 --> 01:41:12.815]  We're going to break in a minute to come back to this, but just the indictment of Roger.
[01:41:12.895 --> 01:41:13.636]  No Russiagate.
[01:41:14.056 --> 01:41:14.836]  A press conference.
[01:41:14.876 --> 01:41:16.237]  The press shuts it down booing.
[01:41:16.938 --> 01:41:18.619]  This is beyond the Soviet Union.
[01:41:18.659 --> 01:41:20.760]  In the Soviet Union, they would listen to what somebody said.
[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:22.461]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:41:23.945 --> 01:41:36.201]  Yeah, Alex, this is a dark day in America as far as I'm concerned for any patriot or anyone who believes in a constitutional republic and believes in the rule of law, believes in liberty and justice above all.
[01:41:36.221 --> 01:41:41.589]  This type of tactics deployed on Roger Stone, who would be just the first, I'm sure,
[01:41:42.269 --> 01:41:43.690]  Uh, if these people have their way.
[01:41:44.010 --> 01:41:54.733]  Would make Lavrentiy Beria, and Stalin, and Himmler, and the rest of them, uh, you know, embarrassed, or, or, you know, proud, let's just say, uh, proud as far as, you know, Well, they'd be envious.
[01:41:54.833 --> 01:41:56.893]  I mean, this is, this is, they would be envious, yeah.
[01:41:57.413 --> 01:41:59.514]  They would absolutely love to have this type of power.
[01:42:00.054 --> 01:42:01.254]  Um, it's a disgrace.
[01:42:01.574 --> 01:42:03.515]  It's a disgusting, appalling abuse.
[01:42:04.095 --> 01:42:06.876]  Uh, it's been turned into, it's been systematized.
[01:42:07.569 --> 01:42:25.501]  And based on literally Roger Stone's voluntary cooperation with the House Intelligence Committee, which clearly is run by partisan mercenaries, this was not a legitimate inquisition or a legitimate inquiry, excuse me, it was an inquisition, and at most what they've done is cooked up
[01:42:27.927 --> 01:42:32.872]  Misstatements and, you know, insufficient information and turned it into crimes.
[01:42:33.333 --> 01:42:34.634]  Still no Russian collusion.
[01:42:35.074 --> 01:42:40.420]  The only Russians, if you want to talk about Russian collusion, we have the Soviets running our Department of Justice as far as I'm concerned.
[01:42:42.165 --> 01:42:48.651]  I can't tell you how many federal marshals, FBI people, other retired current are just like, we're so ashamed right now.
[01:42:49.131 --> 01:42:50.092]  We can't believe this.
[01:42:50.252 --> 01:42:51.854]  I mean, Roger has no criminal record.
[01:42:51.874 --> 01:42:52.814]  He said he turned himself in.
[01:42:53.135 --> 01:42:55.997]  They swat to even point guns at his head, threatened his family.
[01:42:57.118 --> 01:42:58.500]  It's just, my God.
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.681]  And then Mueller's on the tarmac with Putin?
[01:43:07.728 --> 01:43:08.629]  Conservatively,
[01:43:09.349 --> 01:43:19.666]  There have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[01:43:20.891 --> 01:43:39.383]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[01:43:41.025 --> 01:43:43.066]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[01:43:43.446 --> 01:43:44.227]  Whole Foods was number two.
[01:43:45.107 --> 01:43:50.411]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:58.243]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[01:43:59.524 --> 01:44:13.211]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at Infowarslife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[01:44:14.112 --> 01:44:16.173]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[01:44:17.108 --> 01:44:19.990]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[01:44:20.170 --> 01:44:20.770]  No response.
[01:44:20.990 --> 01:44:21.991]  They never want to get my comment.
[01:44:22.511 --> 01:44:23.432]  Now, why am I saying that?
[01:44:24.693 --> 01:44:25.093]  It's simple.
[01:44:26.121 --> 01:44:30.685]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[01:44:31.086 --> 01:44:36.371]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[01:44:37.032 --> 01:44:38.253]  So we have a great product.
[01:44:38.373 --> 01:44:38.793]  You love it.
[01:44:38.853 --> 01:44:39.474]  You reorder it.
[01:44:39.874 --> 01:44:42.117]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[01:44:42.597 --> 01:44:44.499]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[01:44:44.659 --> 01:44:45.700]  It's a 360 win.
[01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:46.741]  We defeat them.
[01:44:46.821 --> 01:44:47.202]  You win.
[01:44:47.342 --> 01:44:47.662]  I win.
[01:44:47.982 --> 01:44:48.483]  It's amazing.
[01:44:50.313 --> 01:44:55.114]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:44:55.154 --> 01:45:10.738]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[01:45:12.679 --> 01:45:13.179]  It's hard to believe.
[01:45:13.259 --> 01:45:16.000]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:23.583]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[01:45:24.404 --> 01:45:26.665]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[01:45:26.685 --> 01:45:36.189]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[01:45:36.289 --> 01:45:36.989]  But just know this.
[01:45:39.011 --> 01:45:47.136]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[01:45:47.456 --> 01:45:49.677]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[01:45:50.417 --> 01:46:00.743]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[01:46:01.563 --> 01:46:02.644]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[01:46:02.764 --> 01:46:03.425]  I'm garbage.
[01:46:04.425 --> 01:46:06.066]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[01:46:06.266 --> 01:46:07.587]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[01:46:08.757 --> 01:46:10.160]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[01:46:10.761 --> 01:46:11.903]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[01:46:12.625 --> 01:46:14.288]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:17.113]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[01:46:17.193 --> 01:46:17.895]  It's all dynamite.
[01:46:19.451 --> 01:46:22.172]  They can tell you how great it is and show you all the facts and tell you.
[01:46:22.372 --> 01:46:23.313]  Because they're the elite.
[01:46:23.653 --> 01:46:24.353]  I'm just scum.
[01:46:24.993 --> 01:46:25.894]  Just like you, according to them.
[01:46:25.954 --> 01:46:28.375]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[01:46:28.735 --> 01:46:32.897]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforwarslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[01:46:33.397 --> 01:46:38.479]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience Supramel Vitality.
[01:46:38.799 --> 01:46:48.784]  By the way, it's the last run of our best-selling product, Supramel Vitality, because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[01:46:49.304 --> 01:46:50.245]  Because it's so frustrating.
[01:46:50.285 --> 01:46:53.467]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:58.490]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail, at InfowarsStore.com and InfowarsLife.com.
[01:46:58.670 --> 01:46:59.470]  Thanks for your support.
[01:47:06.414 --> 01:47:09.036]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.426 --> 01:47:27.844]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen, right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:47.239 --> 01:47:52.421]  Well, I've got mainstream national news hosts calling up saying, word is Mueller's coming after you next.
[01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:54.001]  Want to comment?
[01:47:54.941 --> 01:47:58.943]  Yeah, I didn't cover up Jerry Epstein and his little kidnapped kids on planes.
[01:47:59.743 --> 01:48:01.343]  I'm afraid of God, not Robert Mueller.
[01:48:02.504 --> 01:48:07.786]  And so, I don't look forward to getting hung up by my toes and tortured to death, but you know what?
[01:48:07.826 --> 01:48:08.726]  That's a limited time.
[01:48:09.864 --> 01:48:12.865]  I don't want the full Monty in hell with you guys.
[01:48:12.885 --> 01:48:16.287]  So Mueller and all you guys, Hillary, you can choose Hades.
[01:48:16.787 --> 01:48:17.908]  I want to go with Jesus Christ.
[01:48:17.928 --> 01:48:18.768]  That's where I stand now.
[01:48:18.788 --> 01:48:20.969]  I want to be very clear with listeners and viewers here.
[01:48:21.730 --> 01:48:25.291]  This is the most epic thing we've ever been involved in because it's bigger than Roger Stone.
[01:48:25.311 --> 01:48:26.272]  It's bigger than President Trump.
[01:48:26.292 --> 01:48:27.032]  It's bigger than all of us.
[01:48:28.793 --> 01:48:35.536]  It's about the lies by Hillary and the globalists to overturn an election, to remove the president and the vice president.
[01:48:37.034 --> 01:48:41.515]  And to tell us that being Americana and pro-free market and capitalist is Russian.
[01:48:43.136 --> 01:48:43.716]  With no proof.
[01:48:44.916 --> 01:48:57.080]  And two and a half years into this, almost two years into Mueller, nothing but them perjuring themselves to Congress, nothing but them wearing wires, nothing but them lying about investigations, nothing but them caught red-handed.
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:48:59.820]  And almost all of D.C.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:01.041]  sits back pissing itself.
[01:49:01.857 --> 01:49:05.838]  Well, they send in Mueller's people trying to set us up over and over again.
[01:49:05.858 --> 01:49:07.959]  And I haven't released the big setup stuff yet.
[01:49:09.159 --> 01:49:14.041]  And I... I mean, I'm getting close to that.
[01:49:14.921 --> 01:49:16.581]  But it doesn't even really matter anymore.
[01:49:18.182 --> 01:49:21.583]  Because there are people that are either for the country or against it.
[01:49:23.228 --> 01:49:33.051]  If you don't know that every Democrat group says America sucks and needs to go away, and it was never great, and it'll never be great, and they have chance, then we're not cherry picking.
[01:49:33.632 --> 01:49:44.535]  You think I go to some women's march in Austin funded by Soros or LA or DC, I've been to all of them, or I see my reporter's footage, you think I feel good when I go, oh great, the main march was America's going down.
[01:49:44.555 --> 01:49:47.676]  You think I go, oh good, I can expose the leftists.
[01:49:47.736 --> 01:49:48.957]  No, I literally
[01:49:52.284 --> 01:50:00.987]  Walk in to my bedroom and sometimes just lean up against the wall because I've got strength, but sometimes I start to falter when I think about my kids and the people are this evil.
[01:50:01.267 --> 01:50:02.107]  And I start to cry.
[01:50:02.127 --> 01:50:02.988]  I'm not going to lie to people.
[01:50:03.988 --> 01:50:08.489]  And it's not that I'm crying out of weakness, it's that I just can't believe it.
[01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:15.752]  We have people openly saying they hate America, funded by chi-coms that have killed five times what Hitler did.
[01:50:16.786 --> 01:50:25.651]  And then all we're trying to do is stabilize the country and defend our people, and then we're attacked by a bunch of scum that's involved with the Russians and the Chinese and everybody else.
[01:50:27.272 --> 01:50:28.793]  And it doesn't scare me for myself.
[01:50:29.514 --> 01:50:30.374]  I'm not scared of Mueller.
[01:50:31.275 --> 01:50:42.242]  I'm scared that I'm not strong enough and I didn't do a good enough job to make sure that a goddamn pedophile army of devil worshipers, and I don't mean that in the Lord's name in vain, I mean they're damned to hell, didn't get control of our country.
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:51.728]  And that more people don't realize how serious this is, and how they're planting false flags, and how they're doing all this, and how they're trying to destroy the very essence of a nation existing!
[01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:56.573]  I was there when we were trying to get ahold of WikiLeaks and they wouldn't talk to us.
[01:50:56.933 --> 01:50:57.614]  I was there!
[01:50:57.694 --> 01:50:58.515]  I saw it all!
[01:50:59.736 --> 01:51:06.862]  I was there when I hired reporters to set up bureaus, like we do, and have that turned into hush money by a bunch of damn criminals.
[01:51:06.922 --> 01:51:08.084]  So, going back to
[01:51:09.909 --> 01:51:13.812]  Mr. Nixon, Tyler Nixon, one of the spokesperson lawyers for Roger Stone.
[01:51:13.832 --> 01:51:17.354]  You know, he's told me a lot to say once he got indicted or if he got grabbed or disappeared.
[01:51:17.374 --> 01:51:18.995]  He could disappear next week in this rat hole.
[01:51:19.475 --> 01:51:22.557]  But I just don't think we can count the cost enough here.
[01:51:22.838 --> 01:51:23.898]  How real this is.
[01:51:23.938 --> 01:51:25.319]  This is a 21st century threat.
[01:51:25.559 --> 01:51:30.703]  You couldn't take down America if you were the Nazis or the Chai Kams or the Soviet Russians.
[01:51:30.723 --> 01:51:32.724]  But you could take it down spiritually and culturally.
[01:51:33.285 --> 01:51:34.425]  And they thought it was their time.
[01:51:34.445 --> 01:51:35.366]  They thought Hillary was coming in.
[01:51:35.386 --> 01:51:36.647]  They thought this would be their event.
[01:51:36.987 --> 01:51:39.389]  Trump got in as kind of a speed bump or a wall.
[01:51:40.029 --> 01:51:46.797]  They're trying to overrun that right now, and we can bitch about the president being surrounded by cowards all day, but what do you think Roger needs to do?
[01:51:46.837 --> 01:51:47.998]  What does the audience need to do?
[01:51:48.058 --> 01:51:49.540]  What does the president need to do right now?
[01:51:49.860 --> 01:51:52.283]  Because, clearly, this is an attempt to take the country down.
[01:51:52.903 --> 01:51:54.685]  The jurisprudence is under attack.
[01:51:54.885 --> 01:51:56.147]  The right of the press is under attack.
[01:51:56.607 --> 01:51:58.810]  Everything is fundamentally being overthrown right now.
[01:52:00.595 --> 01:52:03.559]  Brother, I feel your pain, and you know, Alex, you've got big shoulders.
[01:52:03.579 --> 01:52:07.845]  You've been fighting this fight for decades, as have been I in my own way.
[01:52:08.405 --> 01:52:09.627]  And let me tell you something.
[01:52:09.647 --> 01:52:12.851]  I went to Mr. Jefferson's University, the University of Virginia Law School.
[01:52:12.871 --> 01:52:16.236]  That's also where Robert Mueller went, also where Robert Kennedy went.
[01:52:16.816 --> 01:52:22.761]  If Jefferson were alive today, he would be standing next to Roger Stone, not next to Robert Mueller.
[01:52:23.201 --> 01:52:25.803]  These people, the evil in them never rests.
[01:52:26.424 --> 01:52:30.507]  They are persistent, ruthless, vicious mercenaries.
[01:52:31.387 --> 01:52:34.430]  Partisan hacks who have taken control of our government.
[01:52:34.450 --> 01:52:35.491]  The abuse of power.
[01:52:35.911 --> 01:52:41.455]  I have not seen such a railroading for political activity in my life as they have done to Roger Stone.
[01:52:41.535 --> 01:52:42.876]  And this endangers everyone!
[01:52:43.837 --> 01:52:45.098]  And they're doing it to everybody!
[01:52:45.118 --> 01:52:46.119]  This is ridiculous!
[01:52:46.909 --> 01:52:48.530]  Yeah, I know, and they're setting the stage.
[01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:59.917]  They are asserting their power, the way they operate, sending in an armed hit squad to a man who is a peaceable, most peaceable man I know, unless attacked of course.
[01:53:00.537 --> 01:53:05.260]  By the way, he's signaled many times, don't SWAT team me, I'm ready to turn myself in.
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:07.060]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:53:07.281 --> 01:53:08.301]  Why was that necessary?
[01:53:08.541 --> 01:53:11.823]  Was it really necessary to ransack his house or whatever they did?
[01:53:12.243 --> 01:53:14.104]  And fortunately, I will say, I dealt with them.
[01:53:14.424 --> 01:53:15.805]  The FBI agents are courteous.
[01:53:16.926 --> 01:53:17.866]  They're doing their job.
[01:53:18.026 --> 01:53:20.308]  But they're following orders of a rogue criminal cartel.
[01:53:21.072 --> 01:53:21.392]  They are.
[01:53:21.552 --> 01:53:23.713]  And, you know, where is the President?
[01:53:23.833 --> 01:53:28.956]  Okay, the President has, in my opinion, tweeting, I have to agree with Roger, is not getting it anymore.
[01:53:29.616 --> 01:53:33.138]  He needs to, it's unfortunate, he's let it, I think, go too far at this point.
[01:53:33.198 --> 01:53:34.879]  It's going to have to go to its natural conclusion.
[01:53:35.399 --> 01:53:41.942]  Roger has been framed, I mean, this is, you know, it's funny because in September of 17- Tyler, you know my dad!
[01:53:42.022 --> 01:53:45.744]  They're literally calling up, like, oh, Jones, you're not afraid?
[01:53:45.764 --> 01:53:46.785]  Well, put your dad in prison.
[01:53:47.461 --> 01:53:48.281]  My dad!
[01:53:48.921 --> 01:53:49.181]  Oh, no.
[01:53:49.502 --> 01:53:50.622]  Nobody is off limits.
[01:53:50.762 --> 01:53:52.842]  They will take everything that you have.
[01:53:52.862 --> 01:53:53.082]  Take him!
[01:53:53.102 --> 01:53:53.262]  Take him!
[01:53:53.282 --> 01:53:53.603]  He's ready.
[01:53:53.643 --> 01:53:54.283]  My dad's ready.
[01:53:54.323 --> 01:53:54.563]  Take him.
[01:53:54.963 --> 01:53:56.043]  Yeah, your dad's a patriot.
[01:53:56.063 --> 01:53:56.403]  Take him all.
[01:53:56.423 --> 01:53:56.943]  Let's go.
[01:53:57.644 --> 01:53:59.084]  I enjoyed sitting with him and chatting.
[01:53:59.104 --> 01:54:00.804]  He was an oral surgeon, I believe.
[01:54:00.844 --> 01:54:01.765]  My father, same thing.
[01:54:01.805 --> 01:54:02.645]  Dentist, lifelong.
[01:54:03.305 --> 01:54:06.966]  You know, what we're up against, people need to realize, this isn't left versus right.
[01:54:07.006 --> 01:54:08.726]  This isn't Democrat versus Republican.
[01:54:08.766 --> 01:54:11.247]  This is fascist versus freedom fighters.
[01:54:12.047 --> 01:54:15.208]  Exactly, and I've gotten to the point where I literally have to be ready to cut myself loose.
[01:54:16.506 --> 01:54:18.088]  And everything else and my dad loose.
[01:54:18.328 --> 01:54:19.589]  People understand that's where we are.
[01:54:19.909 --> 01:54:21.911]  Because the alternative is so much more evil.
[01:54:21.991 --> 01:54:24.794]  I don't want to be up here standing like this at the parapet.
[01:54:24.854 --> 01:54:26.556]  But I know we're facing real evil.
[01:54:26.836 --> 01:54:27.436]  I have to!
[01:54:27.456 --> 01:54:28.858]  There's not even a question!
[01:54:29.755 --> 01:54:29.855]  Yep.
[01:54:30.335 --> 01:54:35.159]  I served in the Berlin Brigade, and I was proud to do so, right after the wall came down.
[01:54:35.199 --> 01:54:44.365]  And I saw firsthand what Soviet communism in its satellite states and the oppression of socialism looked like 40 years after the war.
[01:54:44.605 --> 01:54:46.206]  There were still bullet-scarred buildings.
[01:54:46.487 --> 01:54:49.589]  You would drive through these streets of Potsdam or, say,
[01:54:50.129 --> 01:54:54.372]  You know, any of these marginal cities outside of West Berlin, and it was a nightmare.
[01:54:54.692 --> 01:54:55.333]  It was dark.
[01:54:55.433 --> 01:54:56.874]  People didn't even come out of doors.
[01:54:56.914 --> 01:54:58.955]  There was no brightness, no life to it.
[01:54:59.316 --> 01:55:09.963]  This is what these people sit in the luxury and the wealth and the opulence of Western capitalism and Western enlightenment values and throw stones at it.
[01:55:09.983 --> 01:55:11.204]  Excuse the pun.
[01:55:11.625 --> 01:55:15.347]  You know, Roger has been throwing stones at them right back for years, as have you.
[01:55:17.850 --> 01:55:20.212]  I'm almost speechless to like, put my finger on it.
[01:55:20.352 --> 01:55:21.533]  It really can be disconcerting.
[01:55:21.553 --> 01:55:31.539]  And I understand how you kind of have to catch yourself sometimes because, you know, those of us who have seen this coming and have tried to warn our fellow citizens and say, look, this isn't a game.
[01:55:31.579 --> 01:55:33.441]  This isn't political gamesmanship here.
[01:55:33.821 --> 01:55:35.622]  We are talking about ruthless people.
[01:55:35.942 --> 01:55:38.944]  Well, not your listeners that they're trying to indict me.
[01:55:40.245 --> 01:55:41.706]  OK, it's going on.
[01:55:41.826 --> 01:55:43.227]  I mean, this is not stunts here.
[01:55:43.267 --> 01:55:45.029]  We're not doing this to play patty cake.
[01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:47.090]  Let me tell you something, these Sandy Hook
[01:55:47.958 --> 01:55:48.518]  Lawsuits.
[01:55:49.259 --> 01:55:57.425]  That's just a tactic to basically dig into your personal finances, the finances of Infor, anything that they can arrange.
[01:55:57.445 --> 01:55:58.906]  They got all the other bank accounts shut down.
[01:55:58.926 --> 01:56:00.347]  They want to figure out how to totally shut us down.
[01:56:00.387 --> 01:56:00.787]  They admit it.
[01:56:01.650 --> 01:56:02.530]  And that's what it is.
[01:56:02.691 --> 01:56:04.712]  It's a literal police state.
[01:56:04.752 --> 01:56:07.593]  Well, see, I don't want to be the guy crying, oh my God, they've got me.
[01:56:07.613 --> 01:56:12.716]  I just want listeners to know that one problem is we're too confident on one end.
[01:56:13.116 --> 01:56:17.958]  But if I wanted to really go up and shoot the bat signal out, we need to be flooded with money.
[01:56:18.519 --> 01:56:22.260]  And I know for a fact less than 1% of people buy products on a regular basis.
[01:56:22.621 --> 01:56:26.122]  If just a few percentage, we would have everything we needed to defeat these people.
[01:56:26.643 --> 01:56:27.463]  But it's how God works.
[01:56:27.483 --> 01:56:28.664]  We always just get enough.
[01:56:28.704 --> 01:56:30.925]  But if I didn't have to spend time, and I'm not bitching,
[01:56:31.525 --> 01:56:35.806]  People say, why don't you just throw Roger overboard?
[01:56:36.406 --> 01:56:39.307]  He didn't do the things they said because I like Roger.
[01:56:39.747 --> 01:56:40.867]  He's a funny, smart guy.
[01:56:40.887 --> 01:56:44.048]  He takes on this label because they call him the bad guy.
[01:56:44.708 --> 01:56:45.528]  It's not true.
[01:56:45.988 --> 01:56:47.748]  He's always telling me, let's not say that.
[01:56:47.789 --> 01:56:48.769]  It's not completely true.
[01:56:49.209 --> 01:56:51.789]  Even though I'm not lying, he thinks it's too far.
[01:56:51.869 --> 01:56:52.970]  He knows truth's the power.
[01:56:53.170 --> 01:56:54.450]  Have you ever heard Roger tell a lie?
[01:56:55.689 --> 01:57:04.554]  No, and that's why I asked a reporter who I was sparring with practically, you know, you have to spar with these people because they're handing you the party line, their party line.
[01:57:04.954 --> 01:57:11.177]  And I said, can you just tell me one documented proven lie that Roger Stone is told publicly or elsewhere?
[01:57:11.557 --> 01:57:14.198]  And he sat and he didn't respond.
[01:57:14.218 --> 01:57:15.439]  He moved on to the next question.
[01:57:15.459 --> 01:57:16.499]  I've asked other people that.
[01:57:16.560 --> 01:57:17.380]  No, they can't.
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:19.101]  Because he knows truth is the power.
[01:57:19.121 --> 01:57:19.961]  And me too.
[01:57:19.981 --> 01:57:20.922]  Stay right there.
[01:57:20.942 --> 01:57:21.762]  We're going to come back.
[01:57:21.782 --> 01:57:22.803]  We've got another guest popping in.
[01:57:23.183 --> 01:57:24.684]  Roger will probably be popping in at the end of the hour.
[01:57:24.724 --> 01:57:25.705]  There's big developments coming.
[01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:29.007]  There's going to be one place you can come to and hear what's happening.
[01:57:29.027 --> 01:57:30.507]  Because he's their big move on the president.
[01:57:30.767 --> 01:57:32.148]  Just like Dershowitz and others have said.
[01:57:32.589 --> 01:57:35.230]  Obviously, they keep lying to him saying, Mr. President, we know you're not a Russian.
[01:57:35.770 --> 01:57:36.591]  We know there's no Russians.
[01:57:37.511 --> 01:57:41.255]  And I'm not mad at the Press Secretary, but her throwing Senator under the bus is pretty sickening.
[01:57:41.275 --> 01:57:43.517]  We'll talk about it all with Mr. Nix on the other side.
[01:57:43.557 --> 01:57:46.559]  Remember, we need financial support now, and we got products you need.
[01:57:47.039 --> 01:57:49.421]  I need your provision, like Colonel Travis writing a letter for help.
[01:57:49.742 --> 01:57:50.943]  I'm gonna stay here no matter what happens.
[01:57:55.427 --> 01:57:57.428]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new year is here.
[01:57:57.928 --> 01:58:12.995]  And I personally, in the new year, am looking at all the great supplements and products at EnforcedLife.com and saying, what do I need to take religiously that I'm forgetting to take, that lowers inflammation, that empowers all the cells in the body, that makes me healthier, better stamina, libido, energy?
[01:58:13.275 --> 01:58:14.256]  And it's these three babies.
[01:58:15.096 --> 01:58:18.897]  It's Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid.
[01:58:18.977 --> 01:58:20.038]  Nobody else can top that.
[01:58:20.058 --> 01:58:21.458]  Top of the line in the nation.
[01:58:22.178 --> 01:58:28.000]  It's X3 that has all three of the good types of iodine together, including the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:33.982]  Because some people can't absorb that type, we put a little bit of the other two types and a tiny bit of Vitamin C to stabilize it.
[01:58:34.242 --> 01:58:36.923]  And then Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:58:37.343 --> 01:58:41.264]  Super Male Vitality has been our overall most successful product.
[01:58:41.664 --> 01:58:44.305]  Neck and neck with Brain Force Plus.
[01:58:44.925 --> 01:58:51.087]  But because it's wildcrafted and a proprietary process, we weren't able to get it for long periods of time.
[01:58:52.008 --> 01:58:56.469]  And so I made the decision just to discontinue it and try to reformulate.
[01:58:56.890 --> 01:58:58.750]  But it's been very, very hard to do.
[01:58:58.810 --> 01:59:01.351]  So we're not discontinuing it because it's crap.
[01:59:01.471 --> 01:59:03.712]  We're discontinuing it because we can't get it.
[01:59:03.792 --> 01:59:07.553]  It may come back in the future, but right now we're just not able to bring it.
[01:59:07.593 --> 01:59:08.794]  This is our last run of it.
[01:59:09.494 --> 01:59:10.115]  Proprietary.
[01:59:10.435 --> 01:59:10.876]  Amazing.
[01:59:11.136 --> 01:59:12.538]  It's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:59:12.918 --> 01:59:14.480]  InfoWars4.com is the umbrella site.
[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.824]  Or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:59:18.324 --> 01:59:18.845]  Bodies.
[01:59:19.445 --> 01:59:19.986]  Turmeric.
[01:59:20.507 --> 01:59:21.007]  Formula.
[01:59:21.247 --> 01:59:23.610]  And it's supercharged with other key ingredients.
[01:59:24.611 --> 01:59:25.192]  Supercharge it.
[01:59:25.212 --> 01:59:25.972]  Bring it to the next level.
[01:59:26.693 --> 01:59:28.074]  And then, of course, it's the X3.
[01:59:28.094 --> 01:59:30.996]  It's our final run of X2.
[01:59:31.036 --> 01:59:42.404]  We've secured the Deep Earth Iodine, but I thought to make a better one with all three types and the vitamin C. But, so get your X2, get your X3, all at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:59:42.925 --> 01:59:47.728]  And again, have a great New Year as we fight the globalists and restore the Republic and freedom to the planet.
[01:59:47.868 --> 01:59:48.349]  Thank you all.
[01:59:56.485 --> 02:00:00.749]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.989 --> 02:00:08.515]  Big Brother Mainstream Media Government Cover-Ups
[02:00:18.226 --> 02:00:19.146]  You want answers?
[02:00:20.127 --> 02:00:21.107]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:22.048 --> 02:00:28.370]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:42.396]  You know, my mom, in 25 years I've been on air, 24 and a half, has gotten mad at some of the things I've said or done, but when she learned they're trying to indict my dad for made-up stuff, man, she just said,
[02:00:44.104 --> 02:00:45.307]  We're good people, we love God.
[02:00:45.327 --> 02:00:48.073]  You just get out there and kick their ass and be strong.
[02:00:48.654 --> 02:00:53.544]  That's the thing is, they don't intimidate me, they make me angry that we have such a cancer.
[02:00:54.904 --> 02:01:01.628]  Of scum who hate the country and who are selling it out and who say America was never great and will never be great.
[02:01:01.728 --> 02:01:06.571]  And then they turn around and they have nothing two plus years later on what we've done.
[02:01:06.692 --> 02:01:07.792]  And then I'll say it.
[02:01:08.433 --> 02:01:11.555]  The president sits there with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who I try to defend.
[02:01:12.255 --> 02:01:14.356]  But what she shows at the end of the day, she's being a politician.
[02:01:14.717 --> 02:01:16.378]  This has nothing to do with the president.
[02:01:16.678 --> 02:01:18.019]  It has everything to do with the president.
[02:01:18.279 --> 02:01:19.339]  Yeah, there's no Russiagate.
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:20.140]  Yeah, there's nothing there.
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:21.001]  Exactly.
[02:01:21.581 --> 02:01:22.902]  So you sit there on your ass.
[02:01:24.292 --> 02:01:30.999]  When you and your daddy need to get up off your fat asses and mobilize the troops to stand up for what's right, then we beat this!
[02:01:31.019 --> 02:01:32.361]  They'll get you next, lady!
[02:01:34.123 --> 02:01:36.906]  Tyler Nixon, lawyer, spokesperson for Stone, what do you say about that?
[02:01:38.347 --> 02:01:41.231]  I'm really disappointed that there's not more.
[02:01:41.311 --> 02:01:43.253]  I mean, there is a circle within the Trump
[02:01:44.065 --> 02:01:55.137]  Well, within the White House, within the larger emanating, I guess, out of the White House and the campaign of people who do not have any concern or care or interest in Roger Stone, because they know that he's brilliant.
[02:01:55.458 --> 02:01:59.522]  They know that his legacy and his heritage or his, you know, his
[02:01:59.602 --> 02:02:02.743]  They know that InfoWars and Stone and all of us, the listeners, got him elected.
[02:02:03.043 --> 02:02:06.224]  And they're all hacks that just attach... We don't want to go attach ourselves in D.C.
[02:02:06.504 --> 02:02:08.165]  Stone didn't ask for a job in D.C.
[02:02:08.545 --> 02:02:09.065]  Exactly.
[02:02:09.265 --> 02:02:10.585]  So they see us as competition.
[02:02:10.646 --> 02:02:12.206]  Instead, they ought to be listening to us.
[02:02:12.226 --> 02:02:13.967]  And I know the President and a few others do listen.
[02:02:14.347 --> 02:02:14.827]  But you're right.
[02:02:14.867 --> 02:02:18.148]  They're very angry that we're the real brain trust, and they're not.
[02:02:18.608 --> 02:02:19.788]  Exactly, dumbasses!
[02:02:20.008 --> 02:02:21.329]  We didn't come from where you are!
[02:02:21.549 --> 02:02:22.429]  We built our own thing!
[02:02:22.589 --> 02:02:24.450]  We called the country, jackasses!
[02:02:27.631 --> 02:02:28.612]  Testify, my brother.
[02:02:28.992 --> 02:02:29.653]  Let me tell you something.
[02:02:29.673 --> 02:02:42.742]  These people, uh, it is time for the quizlings and for the ha- I mean, we've got- I think we've rid ourselves very much so of the neocons, thankfully, but there's still this element of Washington insider- That's right, we got a chainsaw going outside your house.
[02:02:42.762 --> 02:02:43.863]  We'll come back when the lead floor is off.
[02:02:44.343 --> 02:02:44.804]  Exactly.
[02:02:45.204 --> 02:02:54.811]  Nationalism's exploding, capitalism's exploding, people realize the threat of radical Islam, and America is awake, the young people are awake, the neocons have been shoved out, and this is their whole-
[02:02:55.891 --> 02:02:58.892]  Counter-offensive, and it'll crush those of us that are seen as leaders.
[02:02:59.212 --> 02:03:01.792]  But let's, even if they destroy us, let's not take that as a defeat.
[02:03:02.112 --> 02:03:04.213]  Because folks, we're winning the water war, aren't we, Tyler?
[02:03:06.813 --> 02:03:10.114]  Yeah, um, sorry, I got, uh, deep state landscaping working.
[02:03:10.174 --> 02:03:11.234]  I know how it works, brother.
[02:03:11.254 --> 02:03:15.035]  I used to be out of my house doing shows like Knowles and the Late Lord.
[02:03:15.335 --> 02:03:23.417]  As someone I have the utmost respect for, as I do you, Alex, you guys are the stalwarts who have held this, the glue that has held this movement together.
[02:03:23.877 --> 02:03:51.432]  And keeps people going, frankly, who have despaired in the face of the Clintonian Obama cabal that has co-opted our government, abused our justice system, corrupted every process of government they can while they install their, you know, their deep state puppets and minions in there to basically spend tens of millions of taxpayer dollars that people worked hard for to pursue this laughable Kafkaesque inquisition against Stone.
[02:03:51.532 --> 02:03:52.512]  You and others, I mean,
[02:03:53.753 --> 02:04:11.514]  It boggles the mind and it's like where they talk about you know like where are the adults in the room you know where are the where are the righteous people I mean they've literally I think the years of Clinton Bush and Obama drained the swamp literally well not drained the swamp but it rid Washington DC of anybody with any integrity left
[02:04:11.994 --> 02:04:15.516]  I mean, my God, you have Rand Paul, folks like that, but they're outliers anymore.
[02:04:16.277 --> 02:04:27.043]  You know, Lindsey Graham and these folks need to realize they're not... I mean, I don't know if they're trying to sue, say, Trump into whatever his fate may be at the hands of the deep state, but, you know, it's... Let me say what it is.
[02:04:27.063 --> 02:04:29.024]  We're going to come back and finish up with you and go to our next guest.
[02:04:29.044 --> 02:04:29.765]  You've made great points.
[02:04:29.805 --> 02:04:30.605]  Please join us in the War Room.
[02:04:30.625 --> 02:04:33.047]  I've been staying up here until late tonight with Tyler Nixon.
[02:04:34.403 --> 02:04:39.686]  There's still that weird political detente, that senatorial stuff, but the globalists are ignoring it.
[02:04:39.706 --> 02:04:44.129]  So they go say, hey, we're suing for peace, let's make a compromise, but every time they turn against it.
[02:04:44.469 --> 02:04:50.032]  The old senators with all their money and their mistresses and golf courses, they have an incentive not to be young men and fight.
[02:04:50.832 --> 02:04:51.853]  Or soldiers like yourself.
[02:04:52.333 --> 02:04:54.214]  And listen, I don't want to fight either unless I have to.
[02:04:54.294 --> 02:04:56.896]  I can't sign on to a frickin' pedophile system.
[02:04:57.396 --> 02:04:59.517]  We'll be back with final comments from Tyler Nixon straight ahead.
[02:04:59.557 --> 02:05:01.859]  Then our next guest joins us, who's with Roger Stone today.
[02:05:01.879 --> 02:05:02.539]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.610 --> 02:05:09.455]  Scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:12.437]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:05:13.057 --> 02:05:16.480]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:21.024]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:05:21.464 --> 02:05:24.706]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:25.607 --> 02:05:35.858]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:36.619 --> 02:05:45.168]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of active ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the active ingredients.
[02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:55.315]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:06:10.573 --> 02:06:21.858]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:21.878 --> 02:06:27.240]  29 FBI SWAT team members slammed into Roger Stone's home, pointed guns at him and his wife and dogs.
[02:06:29.021 --> 02:06:34.203]  Took him to jail for saying he lied about trying to talk to WikiLeaks, which is totally legal.
[02:06:34.604 --> 02:06:35.204]  And he didn't lie.
[02:06:36.107 --> 02:06:44.709]  That's the war on journalists, where those that bring in MS-13, and drug dealers, and child kidnappers, and radical imams, federal courts rule can cut their daughters' genitals off at age 9.
[02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:47.069]  That's all okay.
[02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:50.970]  You can give uranium on tarmacs to foreign governments like Russia if you're Robert Mueller.
[02:06:52.050 --> 02:07:01.472]  Because at the end of the day, they think America's a bunch of schmucks, and in they come like buzzsaw from The Running Man, with their big old chainsaw, cutting up what our forbearers and veterans built.
[02:07:09.011 --> 02:07:14.135]  Here comes Muller.
[02:07:14.155 --> 02:07:17.959]  Cut that Constitution up.
[02:07:35.765 --> 02:07:36.425]  Ha ha ha!
[02:07:36.545 --> 02:07:37.146]  Eat steaks!
[02:07:37.206 --> 02:07:41.868]  Buzz saws and pencils!
[02:07:42.208 --> 02:07:45.130]  Eat steaks and pencils!
[02:07:45.210 --> 02:07:53.074]  Ooh, but watch out!
[02:07:53.294 --> 02:07:54.935]  You get connected soon!
[02:08:14.258 --> 02:08:16.059]  You can only drag America along for so long.
[02:08:18.161 --> 02:08:24.465]  You know how much America sees through this?
[02:08:24.505 --> 02:08:25.185]  Nobody's buying it.
[02:08:25.245 --> 02:08:28.988]  Even that war press ordered a boo, but Roger couldn't speak.
[02:08:29.008 --> 02:08:30.369]  We're not silenced, America.
[02:08:30.409 --> 02:08:35.772]  Our listeners doing it right now are going to spread the word about it, fullwords.com.
[02:08:35.832 --> 02:08:38.134]  People can hear the truth of what's happening.
[02:08:51.893 --> 02:08:52.874]  Then you know what happens next.
[02:08:56.656 --> 02:08:56.976]  All right.
[02:08:57.937 --> 02:09:02.098]  Tyler Nixon, the spokesperson for Roger Stone, has already been on with us for over an hour today.
[02:09:02.118 --> 02:09:06.901]  He'll be joining us again, coming up in the War Room in about an hour, live-linked, DrudgeReport.com.
[02:09:07.581 --> 02:09:10.802]  He tried to come out, tried to give a speech, tried to talk, tried to take questions.
[02:09:11.042 --> 02:09:12.483]  They just screamed, you're a Russian!
[02:09:13.043 --> 02:09:19.886]  Yes, we're the ones that want more jobs in America and defend our border and bigger defense budgets and space-based defense systems.
[02:09:20.006 --> 02:09:20.987]  Oh, that's the Russians!
[02:09:21.367 --> 02:09:23.008]  The Russians are crapping their pants.
[02:09:23.548 --> 02:09:25.469]  The whole world government order doesn't know what to do.
[02:09:26.969 --> 02:09:37.176]  You can even disagree with some of what Trump does, but you can't disagree that he's making America strong and great again.
[02:09:37.196 --> 02:09:38.877]  So they are trying to stop him.
[02:09:38.897 --> 02:09:40.418]  Tell our next and final comments on that.
[02:09:42.059 --> 02:09:46.681]  This guy literally started this up right after the break ended.
[02:09:47.482 --> 02:09:48.502]  That's why I did the buzzsaw.
[02:09:48.542 --> 02:09:49.023]  It's awesome.
[02:09:49.043 --> 02:09:50.424]  That's why we got buzzsaw coming in here.
[02:09:53.374 --> 02:10:05.281]  Robert Mueller, Herr Mueller of the Heimstatz Polizei, American style, has, in my opinion, just validated Roger Stone, validated Infowars, validated everything you've been saying all along.
[02:10:05.702 --> 02:10:15.387]  They are exactly what we've said they're about all along, which is about power, control, and the ruthless mercenary use of our government.
[02:10:15.868 --> 02:10:17.669]  What was once our government, I should say.
[02:10:18.409 --> 02:10:34.857]  Uh, to carry out the political, personal objectives of ruthless criminals like the Clintons, the Obama ilk, uh, and, you know, I'm sure they're celebrating and they're dancing their little jig in the comment sections of the screeching, squealing degenerate.
[02:10:35.417 --> 02:10:51.049]  Left I mean if you read through some of these comments these people that are living on another planet They've literally constructed these fantasies in their mind, and you know what I like about you Alex to me and about Roger and info wars you are straightforward you're down-to-earth you're real people you're genuine and
[02:10:51.647 --> 02:10:56.975]  We need everybody in this cause now needs the support of everyone out there.
[02:10:57.275 --> 02:11:06.689]  If you didn't think Roger Stone was being serious about how they're coming for him and they're going to come for the president next, they're coming for Alex, anybody they can eliminate in this
[02:11:08.751 --> 02:11:10.251]  That's right.
[02:11:10.271 --> 02:11:11.332]  This is game time.
[02:11:11.372 --> 02:11:12.793]  This is the takedown of the country.
[02:11:12.853 --> 02:11:14.793]  Now they say, I'm the next target, my dad.
[02:11:15.214 --> 02:11:16.774]  I mean, this is just insanity.
[02:11:17.074 --> 02:11:24.958]  But they don't care because they're a lawless group of criminals changing the subject from them with Uranium One and Hillary with the Uranium and the 100 plus million.
[02:11:25.558 --> 02:11:26.919]  We must have a special counsel.
[02:11:27.119 --> 02:11:33.982]  But what about this new Attorney General who is literally Robert Mueller's daddy for George Herbert Walker and the CIA that brought him in?
[02:11:34.002 --> 02:11:35.883]  It just shows how Trump's being lied to on all sides.
[02:11:36.906 --> 02:11:41.628]  This is where I just, I question the President's choice in terms of who he's having counsel him.
[02:11:42.388 --> 02:11:45.030]  Listen, William Barr is praised by Joe DiGenova.
[02:11:45.650 --> 02:11:51.973]  Joe DiGenova is clearly a very, very pro-Trump, anti-Mueller, anti-Cabal individual.
[02:11:52.053 --> 02:11:54.774]  But, you know, it's just, it's about being aggressive.
[02:11:55.094 --> 02:11:56.615]  I guess we need to restore... Well, let's stop there.
[02:11:56.735 --> 02:11:59.536]  I'm always about suing for peace if we're on the winning side for everything.
[02:11:59.896 --> 02:12:04.038]  So they want to go into abstention, and Mueller and others that were minions of the Clintons
[02:12:05.017 --> 02:12:08.459]  Want to stop being criminals and want to back off, that's one thing.
[02:12:09.299 --> 02:12:11.761]  But no, this is clear they're going ahead with the fraud.
[02:12:12.121 --> 02:12:13.221]  We don't want a civil war.
[02:12:13.602 --> 02:12:15.122]  Most analysts say they're going to start one.
[02:12:15.142 --> 02:12:15.963]  This is so dangerous.
[02:12:16.735 --> 02:12:20.496]  They really are, you know, and it's going to come down to that, because our government is no longer our own.
[02:12:20.516 --> 02:12:30.979]  And when I say our, I mean the people, the citizenry as being, I mean, when you see a private citizen, and you notice that no one that Mueller and his team go after actually is in government, are they?
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:32.560]  It's all private citizens.
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:33.740]  It's very interesting, I find.
[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:40.002]  Not that I'm saying that they should be going after anybody, necessarily, but it's just curious that it's always the low-hanging, the easy targets.
[02:12:40.042 --> 02:12:42.263]  It's incredible, it's transparent, it's out of control.
[02:12:42.403 --> 02:12:42.743]  Thank you.
[02:12:42.763 --> 02:12:45.165]  We'll talk to you again in the War Room coming up today with Roger Stone.
[02:12:45.545 --> 02:12:47.566]  Infowars.com slash show live feeds.
[02:12:47.966 --> 02:12:48.727]  Thank you so much.
[02:12:49.087 --> 02:12:50.988]  All right, Jacob Ingalls, we're going to come to you.
[02:12:51.048 --> 02:12:52.509]  He's a publisher of Central Florida Post.
[02:12:52.529 --> 02:12:53.290]  Good friends with Roger.
[02:12:53.610 --> 02:12:55.531]  Just in town a few months ago with Roger and I went out to dinner.
[02:12:55.551 --> 02:12:57.853]  I've known him for a few years with New Dawn Magazine.
[02:12:58.193 --> 02:13:00.514]  He's submitted to Truth Journalism on a local level.
[02:13:02.035 --> 02:13:05.057]  So we're going to be talking to him, another good friend of Roger's.
[02:13:05.097 --> 02:13:08.859]  He was down there today to get his take on this whole hysterical situation on the other side.
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:09.500]  Listen.
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:16.263]  I've gotten so busy the last month, focusing just on news, that we've lost a million dollars.
[02:13:16.843 --> 02:13:18.644]  And that means a million dollars we need to fund things.
[02:13:19.264 --> 02:13:22.225]  BuzzFeed has $300 million a day.
[02:13:22.965 --> 02:13:24.426]  Let me just tell you, straight from BuzzFeed.
[02:13:24.786 --> 02:13:31.609]  They get $300 million a year, Globalist Foundation funding and sponsorship, and they lose $100 million.
[02:13:31.649 --> 02:13:35.751]  Now, that's $100 million where it's all money.
[02:13:38.746 --> 02:13:41.568]  If I sell a million dollars worth of product, on average, we make $500,000.
[02:13:41.789 --> 02:13:46.853]  Then we pay for the bandwidth, the crew, the licensing, everything else.
[02:13:47.573 --> 02:13:52.557]  And it's not about how much money I get, as you see, but maybe I get out of a million dollars, maybe $50,000.
[02:13:52.737 --> 02:13:57.501]  Then I pay for lawyers, all the rest of the BS taxes, and basically make nothing.
[02:13:57.781 --> 02:13:58.602]  It's not about the money.
[02:13:58.662 --> 02:14:00.063]  It's about fuel for war.
[02:14:00.364 --> 02:14:01.084]  It's about ammo.
[02:14:01.164 --> 02:14:03.006]  I'm on the front line, ready to go to the end.
[02:14:03.346 --> 02:14:04.347]  God, I want to go to the end!
[02:14:04.927 --> 02:14:06.168]  But I need funding.
[02:14:06.489 --> 02:14:08.050]  And I don't do a good enough job to explain.
[02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:09.451]  Hey, we're the zeitgeist.
[02:14:09.511 --> 02:14:10.672]  We're the tip of the spear, baby.
[02:14:11.313 --> 02:14:17.638]  BuzzFeed, which employs 1,300 people, generated more than $300 million in revenue in 2018.
[02:14:17.899 --> 02:14:20.040]  But still, they got to get $100 million.
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:22.302]  Document cam shot, please.
[02:14:22.322 --> 02:14:25.825]  $100 million infused by Soros and others.
[02:14:25.865 --> 02:14:26.726]  Zoom in on that.
[02:14:26.746 --> 02:14:27.967]  $300 million.
[02:14:27.987 --> 02:14:29.048]  So see, they got
[02:14:30.129 --> 02:14:36.934]  Folks to illegally give the New York Times stuff for my divorce five years ago, and it said Jones makes $24 million a year.
[02:14:37.414 --> 02:14:38.195]  No, that was our gross.
[02:14:38.695 --> 02:14:40.977]  I made about $2 million that year and paid for it all with lawyers.
[02:14:41.817 --> 02:14:42.718]  You know, after taxes.
[02:14:43.499 --> 02:14:46.681]  But the point is, is that it sounds like a lot.
[02:14:46.741 --> 02:14:47.121]  It's nothing.
[02:14:47.962 --> 02:14:49.463]  $300 million.
[02:14:49.503 --> 02:14:50.584]  We're way bigger than they are.
[02:14:51.448 --> 02:14:54.470]  We're organic, bringing in $45 million a year now.
[02:14:54.731 --> 02:14:56.252]  That was five years ago, 20-something million.
[02:14:56.752 --> 02:14:58.213]  We started bringing in $45 million.
[02:14:58.533 --> 02:15:00.255]  Now I've got $20 million to work with.
[02:15:00.895 --> 02:15:04.438]  After all the bandwidth taxes, I mean, today will be hundreds of thousands of dollars in bandwidth.
[02:15:04.478 --> 02:15:05.599]  We're so gigantic right now.
[02:15:06.019 --> 02:15:07.080]  The average person doesn't buy anything.
[02:15:07.160 --> 02:15:07.400]  Fine.
[02:15:08.121 --> 02:15:14.446]  So then I end up with a few million, pay it to lawyers, have nothing, and I'm like, well, I could sell my house and fund the place another three months.
[02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:16.490]  You see where we're getting into here.
[02:15:16.590 --> 02:15:17.671]  I can't get in that position.
[02:15:18.231 --> 02:15:19.151]  I don't give a rat's ass.
[02:15:19.231 --> 02:15:23.013]  I mean, even about my own body, when it comes to war, I just need the fuel.
[02:15:23.073 --> 02:15:24.853]  So, we're down to this, folks.
[02:15:25.474 --> 02:15:26.294]  We're down to the wire.
[02:15:26.794 --> 02:15:28.515]  Bringing in $45 million this year.
[02:15:29.075 --> 02:15:31.256]  The way they've shut us down, we're lucky if it's $30 million this year.
[02:15:31.856 --> 02:15:33.776]  And I'll have to lay people off and start shutting down.
[02:15:34.517 --> 02:15:38.938]  So, because again, $30 million gross, half of its product cost, so it's $15 million.
[02:15:40.479 --> 02:15:43.960]  I've got $5, $10 million or whatever it is in bandwidth cost.
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:45.700]  You're like, oh, just do it yourself!
[02:15:45.940 --> 02:15:47.061]  I'm doing it myself!
[02:15:47.321 --> 02:15:49.982]  I'm fighting as hard as I can, but I need you to commit and go, damn it!
[02:15:50.382 --> 02:15:54.523]  I'm gonna go to Infowarsstore.com, and I'm gonna buy the best products.
[02:15:54.883 --> 02:15:55.823]  The best fish oil.
[02:15:56.043 --> 02:15:57.384]  The best brain boost.
[02:15:57.624 --> 02:15:58.704]  The best turbo force.
[02:15:58.904 --> 02:16:00.305]  I'm gonna go there and I'm gonna do it!
[02:16:00.525 --> 02:16:01.165]  It's a war!
[02:16:01.385 --> 02:16:01.885]  Help us!
[02:16:02.365 --> 02:16:02.865]  Most of you.
[02:16:03.125 --> 02:16:07.346]  Imagine if Infowars hadn't been here to expose global government.
[02:16:08.187 --> 02:16:12.128]  To expose their plan to implode national sovereignty and nation's borders.
[02:16:13.254 --> 02:16:20.978]  Imagine if the lights had been turned off all those years and the incredibly important topics we talk about hadn't been discussed.
[02:16:22.559 --> 02:16:26.181]  But it's because of you doing that over the years that we're here.
[02:16:26.921 --> 02:16:28.402]  And that's not some platitude.
[02:16:28.442 --> 02:16:29.583]  That's not some pat on the back.
[02:16:30.783 --> 02:16:36.647]  That is the humble recognition that you are the sea on which all of us sail.
[02:16:38.368 --> 02:16:38.928]  I'm the sea.
[02:16:39.088 --> 02:16:39.688]  You're the sea.
[02:16:40.228 --> 02:16:40.709]  I'm the wind.
[02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:53.371]  You're the wind, we are all the sails together in this, but if you hadn't resonated with what we talked about and what we did, if you hadn't prayed for us and spread the word and supported us, we wouldn't be here.
[02:16:53.951 --> 02:17:07.754]  If you hadn't been faithful in our shared destiny together, we wouldn't have already had these successes and nationalism exploding across the world and all the incredible positive things happening that have unfolded.
[02:17:09.495 --> 02:17:10.695]  But because of you, we've done that.
[02:17:11.650 --> 02:17:12.370]  There's an equation.
[02:17:13.430 --> 02:17:18.512]  If you spread the word about InfoWars and the articles, the videos, the links, we get around the enemy.
[02:17:19.252 --> 02:17:25.273]  And if you fund the information we're producing, it all comes together.
[02:17:25.914 --> 02:17:27.854]  But it comes down to that, chicken or the egg.
[02:17:28.854 --> 02:17:39.417]  If you don't fund the seed money to keep InfoWars on the air and to fight against the fake lawsuits and the attacks of Soros and Hillary and others, we won't have the information to put on air for all of you to spread.
[02:17:40.310 --> 02:17:47.433]  So each one is just as important, but the most critical point the enemy understands is cutting the funding off.
[02:17:48.733 --> 02:17:51.915]  They don't want to have us be live on air while all this unfolds.
[02:17:53.355 --> 02:17:59.198]  They don't want to have us be here while the globalists push their entire world government agenda and everything we've talked about comes true.
[02:17:59.738 --> 02:18:06.000]  They don't want us here when they try to assassinate nationalist and populist leaders and while they overrun Christian countries with radical Islamists.
[02:18:06.381 --> 02:18:07.161]  They want us off the air.
[02:18:09.321 --> 02:18:12.322]  That's why I am in your hands, you're in my hands.
[02:18:12.722 --> 02:18:16.543]  If I give up, if I back down, if I waver, it's a big victory for the globalists.
[02:18:17.384 --> 02:18:20.865]  And if you back down, if you waver, it's a big victory for them as well.
[02:18:22.005 --> 02:18:24.746]  It's truly a life and death struggle.
[02:18:25.346 --> 02:18:26.927]  So all I'm going to say in closing is this.
[02:18:27.907 --> 02:18:29.347]  Our destinies are bound forever.
[02:18:30.928 --> 02:18:31.068]  And
[02:18:32.768 --> 02:18:36.990]  Doing something this epic almost feels sick to say, hey, come give me your money.
[02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:39.371]  But you've seen what I've done with your money.
[02:18:39.611 --> 02:18:42.732]  I have waged war, fearlessly and tirelessly.
[02:18:42.892 --> 02:18:44.613]  I have dominated globalists.
[02:18:44.693 --> 02:18:46.114]  I have overrun their emplacements.
[02:18:46.634 --> 02:18:51.196]  We have spread the message of liberty in 1776 worldwide, and we are committed to that destiny.
[02:18:51.676 --> 02:18:54.317]  And so with pride, I tell you, financially support us.
[02:18:55.058 --> 02:18:59.100]  Any other war chief in a fight for freedom would just say, support me, give me the funding now.
[02:18:59.300 --> 02:18:59.680]  I say,
[02:19:01.172 --> 02:19:06.976]  Get products of the best out there, win-win situation, fund us, and we're going to stop altogether.
[02:19:07.537 --> 02:19:10.879]  If we don't do that, there's no future, and we have no shared destiny.
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:19.365]  I'm very sad that Supermill Vitality, our flagship product, is no longer available when this sells out, because we can't get the wild, crafted herbs.
[02:19:19.866 --> 02:19:24.309]  The process it goes through is so organic, like making of wine, that it can't be produced anymore.
[02:19:25.050 --> 02:19:26.150]  So that's why it's the last run.
[02:19:27.179 --> 02:19:29.541]  It's available 50% off even though it's our last run.
[02:19:30.022 --> 02:19:32.424]  MFORESTORE.COM because I want you to experience it before it's gone.
[02:19:33.336 --> 02:19:35.277]  But whatever you do, pray for InfoWars.
[02:19:35.638 --> 02:19:37.399]  Spread the articles, spread the links, spread the videos.
[02:19:37.699 --> 02:19:40.661]  Because without you, we are going to basically be destroyed.
[02:19:41.161 --> 02:19:43.743]  But with your support, together we all go into the future.
[02:19:44.144 --> 02:19:52.770]  Whatever you do, just remember that the power of you, via word of mouth, speaking out and taking action, is the most powerful thing in the universe, next to God.
[02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:58.494]  And for your support, and your undying prayers, I thank you, and I salute you.
[02:19:58.514 --> 02:20:00.975]  But more importantly, we are bound, and I love you.
[02:20:01.536 --> 02:20:01.936]  So thank you.
[02:20:05.928 --> 02:20:08.532]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:42.819 --> 02:20:48.868]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:20:49.288 --> 02:20:51.732]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:21:00.253 --> 02:21:01.334]  We're going to Jacob Ingalls.
[02:21:01.354 --> 02:21:03.476]  We're going to open the phones to the next hour.
[02:21:03.496 --> 02:21:04.296]  We have another guest joining us.
[02:21:04.316 --> 02:21:05.897]  I'm going to stay here and co-host the War Room.
[02:21:06.318 --> 02:21:07.819]  Roger's joining us again next hour.
[02:21:07.839 --> 02:21:08.720]  Global exclusive.
[02:21:09.300 --> 02:21:10.721]  Unable to go out and speak to the press.
[02:21:10.801 --> 02:21:12.382]  The biggest press conference I've ever seen.
[02:21:12.763 --> 02:21:13.443]  Probably the biggest ever.
[02:21:13.463 --> 02:21:14.944]  Looked like three times the size of the O.J.
[02:21:14.964 --> 02:21:15.305]  Simpson.
[02:21:16.707 --> 02:21:17.648]  And they wouldn't let him talk.
[02:21:17.708 --> 02:21:20.529]  It was the press booing and saying, shut up, because they're not the press.
[02:21:20.569 --> 02:21:22.890]  But the president, as we speak, start rolling it.
[02:21:23.210 --> 02:21:26.632]  He's in the middle of his comments about another compromise, which I get.
[02:21:26.892 --> 02:21:30.414]  The Democrats want no compromise, no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[02:21:30.434 --> 02:21:31.975]  So he's compromised on everything now.
[02:21:32.315 --> 02:21:41.760]  I am very proud to announce today that we have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government.
[02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:42.641]  It's a few minutes ago.
[02:21:44.602 --> 02:21:44.882]  Yay!
[02:21:47.910 --> 02:21:54.695]  As everyone knows, I have a very powerful alternative, but I didn't want to use it at this time.
[02:21:55.936 --> 02:21:58.078]  Hopefully it will be unnecessary.
[02:21:58.718 --> 02:22:09.527]  I want to thank all of the incredible federal workers and their amazing families who have shown such extraordinary devotion in the face of this recent hardship.
[02:22:10.568 --> 02:22:11.969]  You are fantastic people.
[02:22:13.223 --> 02:22:14.684]  You are incredible patriots.
[02:22:15.564 --> 02:22:22.246]  Many of you have suffered far greater than anyone, but your families would know or understand.
[02:22:23.847 --> 02:22:35.831]  And not only did you not complain, but in many cases you encouraged me to keep going because you care so much about our country and about its border security.
[02:22:37.671 --> 02:22:38.331]  Again, I thank you.
[02:22:38.351 --> 02:22:40.352]  North Texas air traffic controllers quit their damn job.
[02:22:40.852 --> 02:22:41.332]  All Americans.
[02:22:41.352 --> 02:22:43.893]  And Trump should have declared the emergency like Reagan and act like a damn boss.
[02:22:43.913 --> 02:22:45.033]  You are very, very special people.
[02:22:45.053 --> 02:22:46.994]  People start to notice I'm getting sick of Trump right now.
[02:22:48.614 --> 02:22:51.555]  I am so proud that you are citizens of our country.
[02:22:53.176 --> 02:22:57.297]  When I say make America great again, it could never be done without you.
[02:22:57.317 --> 02:22:58.737]  The left doesn't take him being nice as good.
[02:22:58.757 --> 02:22:59.638]  They take it as weakness.
[02:23:00.758 --> 02:23:01.398]  Great people.
[02:23:02.919 --> 02:23:07.160]  In a short while, I will sign a bill to open our government
[02:23:08.123 --> 02:23:09.744]  For three weeks until February 15th.
[02:23:09.764 --> 02:23:12.106]  I wonder if they arrest me if Sarah Sandelson has nothing to do with the President.
[02:23:12.126 --> 02:23:19.433]  I will make sure that all employees receive their back pay very quickly or as soon as possible.
[02:23:20.354 --> 02:23:21.294]  It'll happen fast.
[02:23:22.535 --> 02:23:29.682]  I am asking Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to put this proposal on the floor immediately.
[02:23:29.702 --> 02:23:31.063]  So I'm starting to get pissed.
[02:23:31.223 --> 02:23:34.486]  After 36 days of spirited debate and dialogue,
[02:23:35.439 --> 02:23:52.549]  I have seen and heard from enough Democrats and Republicans that they are willing to put partisanship aside, I think, and put the security of the American people first.
[02:23:52.629 --> 02:23:52.789]  Really?
[02:23:52.829 --> 02:23:53.590]  I don't see any damn wall there.
[02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:54.951]  I do believe they're going to do that.
[02:23:55.171 --> 02:23:55.611]  Bastards.
[02:23:55.851 --> 02:24:03.436]  They have said they are for complete border security, and they have finally and fully acknowledged
[02:24:04.397 --> 02:24:13.441]  That having barriers or whatever you want to call it will be an important part of the solution.
[02:24:14.602 --> 02:24:21.045]  A bipartisan conference committee of House and Senate lawmakers and leaders
[02:24:23.206 --> 02:24:29.655]  We'll immediately begin reviewing the requests of our homeland security experts, and experts they are.
[02:24:30.156 --> 02:24:34.382]  That does sound like a cave-in by the Democrats though, to give them a way out to experts, so maybe Trump's gonna be right.
[02:24:35.043 --> 02:24:35.703]  All I know is...
[02:24:36.954 --> 02:24:38.295]  Appoint a special counsel.
[02:24:38.375 --> 02:24:39.296]  Okay, that's enough of this.
[02:24:39.697 --> 02:24:40.577]  We know what's happening.
[02:24:40.597 --> 02:24:45.041]  They're all punting, which shows both sides kind of blinked.
[02:24:46.022 --> 02:24:47.543]  Let's go to Jacob Ingles.
[02:24:47.563 --> 02:24:50.826]  He's the publisher of Central Florida Post, contributor to the new Dawn Magazine.
[02:24:50.886 --> 02:24:53.889]  He is a committed to the truth journalism on a local level.
[02:24:54.309 --> 02:24:55.690]  Twitter at Jacob Ingles.
[02:24:56.591 --> 02:24:57.472]  Central Florida Post.
[02:24:57.552 --> 02:24:58.954]  I've known him for years.
[02:24:59.014 --> 02:24:59.695]  Had him on many times.
[02:24:59.735 --> 02:25:01.016]  Had dinner with him and Roger a few weeks ago.
[02:25:01.537 --> 02:25:02.878]  I was out with a gay guy at dinner.
[02:25:03.018 --> 02:25:03.699]  Whoop-dee-frickin'-do.
[02:25:03.739 --> 02:25:04.940]  I could care less if you're gay or straight.
[02:25:05.341 --> 02:25:06.342]  I won't even add that he's gay.
[02:25:06.362 --> 02:25:09.425]  They say all gay people support, you know, the Democrats.
[02:25:09.465 --> 02:25:10.627]  It was just a total canard.
[02:25:11.187 --> 02:25:12.649]  What do you make of this?
[02:25:12.769 --> 02:25:15.011]  I mean, you were at the Women's March, the Insanity, now this.
[02:25:15.732 --> 02:25:16.993]  I'm not trying to just bash Trump.
[02:25:17.093 --> 02:25:21.957]  My days of sitting there while he lets Mueller run roughshod over everybody, and I'm done.
[02:25:22.077 --> 02:25:24.519]  I want Uranium One special prosecutors.
[02:25:24.659 --> 02:25:26.620]  I want Hillary's ass investigated, dammit.
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:30.943]  I mean, my daddy's getting investigated for Russiagate when there's nothing there now.
[02:25:31.083 --> 02:25:35.246]  I want that frickin' whore that sold this country out to anybody that would buy us off.
[02:25:35.607 --> 02:25:37.368]  I want that whore indicted!
[02:25:38.868 --> 02:25:42.730]  No, that disgusting fat whore Hillary Clinton needs to be in prison.
[02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:46.492]  If they're going to do this to Roger Stone, we must see indictments of other people.
[02:25:46.532 --> 02:25:53.876]  And if not, the citizens and great patriots and pro-warriors, freedom lovers must stand up, take to the streets, and make citizens arrest.
[02:25:54.266 --> 02:25:56.289]  We must hold government accountable.
[02:25:56.329 --> 02:26:00.514]  What happened today to Roger Stone could happen to me, could happen to you, Alex.
[02:26:00.534 --> 02:26:03.558]  That's why it's vitally important that people support- Could happen to me?
[02:26:03.618 --> 02:26:05.040]  I'm in the frickin' Washington Post!
[02:26:05.401 --> 02:26:07.964]  They're saying that we give hush money to a reporter we hired!
[02:26:08.485 --> 02:26:09.987]  These people never frickin' end, man!
[02:26:11.227 --> 02:26:11.808]  It's bullshit.
[02:26:11.928 --> 02:26:12.488]  It's bullshit.
[02:26:12.548 --> 02:26:18.392]  And when you see Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and when you see her make that statement, we need strong support from this White House.
[02:26:18.452 --> 02:26:19.613]  We need strong support.
[02:26:19.633 --> 02:26:24.076]  I mean, you agree with me that, we'll play it when we come back from break, that her, oh, this has nothing to do with us.
[02:26:24.557 --> 02:26:25.598]  Nothing to do with us.
[02:26:25.618 --> 02:26:27.139]  Trump's saying, get me the WikiLeaks.
[02:26:27.159 --> 02:26:27.899]  That's totally normal.
[02:26:27.939 --> 02:26:28.740]  Everybody was trying to get them.
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:32.963]  Stone goes out and tries to get them, doesn't get them, and then he's going to go to prison for that?
[02:26:33.183 --> 02:26:34.404]  And then Huckabee sits there?
[02:26:34.424 --> 02:26:36.605]  Frickin' he's a human being, lady.
[02:26:37.466 --> 02:26:43.436]  God, I don't want to like her because she's a leftist taxer, but Jesus, with friends like this, man, we don't need Democrats.
[02:26:44.781 --> 02:26:45.602]  No, no, no.
[02:26:45.702 --> 02:26:51.646]  We need strong patriots, people who are listening right now, to get up, stand up, and get out in the streets.
[02:26:51.947 --> 02:26:55.349]  How long are we going to sit here and wait for the other shoe to drop?
[02:26:55.529 --> 02:26:56.610]  Well, we talked at 8 a.m.
[02:26:56.650 --> 02:26:59.092]  this morning, and you were shaking, I was shaking when I called you.
[02:26:59.412 --> 02:27:00.113]  You just learned.
[02:27:00.133 --> 02:27:03.495]  I mean, this is like 50 times the Red Scare.
[02:27:03.535 --> 02:27:04.216]  This is real.
[02:27:04.276 --> 02:27:05.277]  This is Nazi Germany.
[02:27:05.657 --> 02:27:06.678]  This is Soviet Union, man.
[02:27:06.698 --> 02:27:07.378]  This ain't a joke.
[02:27:07.679 --> 02:27:08.159]  This is real.
[02:27:09.079 --> 02:27:16.284]  Well, and the left has been telling us for two years that we are in the Fourth Reich, that we are under Hitler.
[02:27:16.504 --> 02:27:17.085]  And you know what?
[02:27:17.405 --> 02:27:19.106]  I'm going to admit they are right.
[02:27:19.186 --> 02:27:20.407]  We are in the Fourth Reich.
[02:27:20.507 --> 02:27:21.468]  We are under Hitler.
[02:27:21.528 --> 02:27:23.490]  And the Fuhrer's name is Robert Mueller.
[02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:28.633]  Robert Mueller is running a Gestapo-style hit squad that is silencing political enemies.
[02:27:28.953 --> 02:27:30.314]  And how far will he go?
[02:27:30.375 --> 02:27:33.717]  He will go as far to bring SWAT teams to a peaceful man's home.
[02:27:34.133 --> 02:27:41.515]  In the middle of the night, early morning, terrorizes family, terrorizes wife, terrorizes dogs, and that is sick.
[02:27:41.875 --> 02:27:47.157]  It is raw power, and American citizens must stand up now more than ever.
[02:27:47.377 --> 02:27:49.418]  What are patriots going to do?
[02:27:49.498 --> 02:27:50.818]  We must support the InfoWars.
[02:27:50.858 --> 02:27:52.519]  We must support Roger Stone.
[02:27:52.899 --> 02:27:55.219]  Go on, buy something on InfoWars.com.
[02:27:55.279 --> 02:27:56.880]  Go and donate at stonedefensefund.com.
[02:27:56.920 --> 02:28:01.084]  By the way, Jacob, you know, if they don't support Roger or me or others, then I don't even really care at the end of the day.
[02:28:01.384 --> 02:28:01.764]  You know what?
[02:28:01.804 --> 02:28:02.225]  Fine, folks.
[02:28:02.265 --> 02:28:04.867]  If you don't see what we've done, where we're at, I thank the listeners.
[02:28:05.087 --> 02:28:06.348]  This is show cut and dry.
[02:28:06.488 --> 02:28:09.211]  I can't imagine that America isn't more pissed.
[02:28:09.231 --> 02:28:12.774]  Like, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is, like, glad there's no Russian collusion.
[02:28:13.074 --> 02:28:14.275]  Says it has nothing to do with the White House.
[02:28:14.375 --> 02:28:14.715]  Oh, great.
[02:28:14.795 --> 02:28:17.458]  Cut him loose when Trump called him a hero a few months ago.
[02:28:18.278 --> 02:28:23.060]  It's like, that is like blood in the water, but again, they're a bunch of damn cowards!
[02:28:23.361 --> 02:28:25.001]  We need wartime presidents!
[02:28:25.261 --> 02:28:26.562]  We're fighting for our country!
[02:28:26.762 --> 02:28:29.764]  We need people committed to this damn country!
[02:28:29.784 --> 02:28:32.945]  Hell yes, Alex.
[02:28:33.025 --> 02:28:33.966]  Let's get angry.
[02:28:34.006 --> 02:28:39.068]  Let's get wild, because if we don't do something now, what the F are we going to have?
[02:28:39.088 --> 02:28:40.329]  We're getting the false flags ready.
[02:28:40.369 --> 02:28:41.189]  They're gonna make their move.
[02:28:41.209 --> 02:28:42.390]  They got their terror teams ready.
[02:28:43.710 --> 02:28:47.092]  All I know is I've committed my will to this, and I think we're gonna win in the end.
[02:28:48.098 --> 02:28:52.604]  Everybody has been maneuvered into whoever gets banned, oh don't defend them, you'll get banned.
[02:28:52.624 --> 02:28:54.086]  They've already taught you how to be cowards.
[02:28:54.346 --> 02:28:56.049]  You've already failed Lesson 1.
[02:28:56.850 --> 02:28:58.973]  Now you'll fail forever if you don't wake up.
[02:29:04.161 --> 02:29:05.142]  Now, you've stayed vigilant.
[02:29:05.182 --> 02:29:06.244]  You've been pushing the site.
[02:29:06.284 --> 02:29:07.485]  You've been helping us get it out there.
[02:29:07.565 --> 02:29:11.110]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[02:29:11.310 --> 02:29:14.414]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:29:14.534 --> 02:29:15.496]  Get that link out to everybody.
[02:29:15.616 --> 02:29:19.561]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil.
[02:29:19.721 --> 02:29:20.942]  We're good to go.
[02:29:46.053 --> 02:29:52.321]  TurboForce is the ultimate vitamin mineral, total energy, fusion, next level, total mega package.
[02:29:52.381 --> 02:29:53.543]  Nothing else is even near it.
[02:29:53.703 --> 02:29:59.450]  Get TurboForce today at InfoWarsLive.com, but I recommend you only take half a dose the first time.
[02:29:59.570 --> 02:30:01.052]  Beware the power of TurboForce!
[02:30:06.069 --> 02:30:13.933]  You've got Alexandra Cortez coming out saying CBS is racist and bad because they didn't send a black reporter to cover her for Congress.
[02:30:14.253 --> 02:30:16.134]  She says, better get better next time.
[02:30:16.194 --> 02:30:20.115]  That's why to counter her, to get back in her face whenever she said that Don Jr.
[02:30:20.195 --> 02:30:24.017]  might face prison time for making the point that, you know, she loves Venezuela so much.
[02:30:24.157 --> 02:30:25.538]  In Venezuela, they eat their dogs.
[02:30:25.678 --> 02:30:28.259]  In capitalist countries like America, we walk our dogs.
[02:30:28.539 --> 02:30:33.641]  So, I came up with the idea for this little baby, and we have this as a limited edition, but I want it to be a bestseller.
[02:30:33.761 --> 02:30:34.941]  This is the first limited edition.
[02:30:34.961 --> 02:30:36.102]  We have another design coming out.
[02:30:36.402 --> 02:30:39.263]  There's only a few thousand of these, but we want this to be a huge seller.
[02:30:39.543 --> 02:30:43.424]  We want to put 50,000, 100,000 out of these like we've done Hillary for President.
[02:30:44.044 --> 02:30:47.906]  And it says, Capitalists walk their dogs, Socialists eat them.
[02:30:48.646 --> 02:30:53.027]  Then it's got an American flag that's very triggering to her, saying InfoWars.com.
[02:30:53.648 --> 02:30:54.368]  So there it is.
[02:30:55.508 --> 02:30:57.809]  It is on InfoWars.com.
[02:30:58.409 --> 02:31:01.030]  There's links to it on InfoWars.com.
[02:31:01.591 --> 02:31:02.531]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:02.631 --> 02:31:05.392]  Capitalist Walk Their Dog, Socialist Eat Them shirt.
[02:31:05.472 --> 02:31:15.997]  This is triggering, this is powerful, and it shows her with an enlarged cartoon head with giant ears looking like a dog foaming at the mouth because that's what she looks like is a dog on methamphetamine.
[02:31:16.137 --> 02:31:17.597]  She's probably on methamphetamine.
[02:31:17.617 --> 02:31:18.398]  I mean, what is she on?
[02:31:18.418 --> 02:31:19.238]  We should ask the question.
[02:31:19.258 --> 02:31:19.938]  She used to be good-looking.
[02:31:20.038 --> 02:31:21.939]  She's lost so much weight and has meth mouth.
[02:31:22.119 --> 02:31:24.561]  So you could call it the Alexandra Cortez meth mouth.
[02:31:24.741 --> 02:31:32.186]  Because she dares to threaten people with jail time and subpoenas if they make fun of the fact that capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[02:31:32.346 --> 02:31:35.428]  And she looks meth, you know, out of her brain now.
[02:31:35.488 --> 02:31:37.810]  Like she's flying on planet Pop-Tart.
[02:31:37.910 --> 02:31:40.152]  And so, get the hottest shirt on the internet.
[02:31:40.172 --> 02:31:41.232]  We know it's going to be the hottest.
[02:31:41.252 --> 02:31:43.874]  No reviews yet because we're just launching it in the last few days.
[02:31:44.034 --> 02:31:46.936]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:31:49.138 --> 02:31:50.118]  Listen, we need your support.
[02:31:50.158 --> 02:31:52.059]  We want these to blow off the shelf.
[02:31:52.199 --> 02:31:53.159]  I want to reorder them.
[02:31:53.259 --> 02:31:55.540]  We're going to have a slightly different design each time.
[02:31:55.560 --> 02:32:00.341]  I want to have 10 different limited editions sell out in the next six months of this.
[02:32:00.441 --> 02:32:04.442]  And I want this everywhere, because she's the new symbol of the Democratic Party.
[02:32:05.002 --> 02:32:08.463]  And it points out, capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[02:32:08.784 --> 02:32:11.784]  And when people say, man, well, why are you showing her as a dog?
[02:32:12.044 --> 02:32:13.765]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, in the final
[02:32:14.025 --> 02:32:15.145]  Equation of communism.
[02:32:15.245 --> 02:32:17.526]  People eat people and are made lower than dogs.
[02:32:17.666 --> 02:32:21.907]  And she is an absolute tyrant wanting to arrest people that make fun of her.
[02:32:22.067 --> 02:32:25.808]  And so we're going to show her how America works and throw it back in her face.
[02:32:25.888 --> 02:32:29.349]  Because she, her dancing a few years ago, she was good looking and looked healthy.
[02:32:29.889 --> 02:32:30.969]  What drugs are she on?
[02:32:30.989 --> 02:32:32.570]  We need an intervention.
[02:32:32.690 --> 02:32:33.450]  Methamphetamine?
[02:32:33.470 --> 02:32:35.391]  Or is it Adderall?
[02:32:35.631 --> 02:32:36.571]  What is she snorting?
[02:32:36.891 --> 02:32:38.691]  We need to help Alexandria Cortez.
[02:32:38.871 --> 02:32:39.532]  Get the t-shirt.
[02:32:39.732 --> 02:32:40.652]  Infomercial.com.
[02:32:40.772 --> 02:32:41.032]  Do it!
[02:33:06.835 --> 02:33:09.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:19.542 --> 02:33:24.604]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.212 --> 02:33:38.574]  Science has proven what the ancients documented and knew in their hearts.
[02:33:39.614 --> 02:33:46.737]  There are all these universes and worlds and systems around us that aren't perceivable to the eye, but are to the soul.
[02:33:48.218 --> 02:33:54.260]  And when I say that I've cut my own life loose, that of my family, it's not that I don't love them more than ever.
[02:33:55.420 --> 02:33:59.102]  It's that in cutting them loose, I hit the next level of love.
[02:34:00.310 --> 02:34:04.932]  In not giving in to the fear, not giving in to the bullying, understanding there's things bigger than just this life.
[02:34:05.432 --> 02:34:12.695]  And that we've gotten in this position because the average man just wants to act cool in front of other men and make more money.
[02:34:12.715 --> 02:34:14.256]  And the average woman wants to do the same thing.
[02:34:14.336 --> 02:34:16.637]  Act cool in front of women and have status.
[02:34:16.777 --> 02:34:17.917]  It's not real status.
[02:34:17.977 --> 02:34:18.458]  It's fake.
[02:34:19.638 --> 02:34:21.539]  Real will built civilization.
[02:34:21.679 --> 02:34:24.040]  Real guts built everything we've got.
[02:34:25.407 --> 02:34:37.297]  And I see the average man today, and I don't think of myself as a tough guy, and compared to, it's true, my grandfathers and their grandfathers, they weren't trying to act manly, they were men.
[02:34:38.739 --> 02:34:42.842]  But they lived in a different age when everybody was basically a man, so there wasn't a big problem.
[02:34:43.443 --> 02:34:47.727]  They were strong, they were focused, they weren't controlled by what other people said.
[02:34:48.167 --> 02:34:50.269]  They had a rudder, they had a North Star.
[02:34:52.848 --> 02:34:56.072]  And I see us losing our ancestral strength.
[02:34:56.152 --> 02:34:57.373]  I see us losing our will.
[02:34:59.716 --> 02:35:02.499]  And I see people bowing and cowering.
[02:35:02.539 --> 02:35:06.883]  And I see that group of cowardly reporters, over a thousand of them, one of the biggest press conferences.
[02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:09.006]  We've got to look it up, but I've never seen anything like it.
[02:35:09.026 --> 02:35:09.927]  I think it's the biggest one ever.
[02:35:10.748 --> 02:35:16.429]  I mean, there's more damn reporters out at one gaggle than you'd see at the Royal Wedding.
[02:35:17.150 --> 02:35:18.830]  And it was them.
[02:35:19.010 --> 02:35:19.590]  I talked to Roger.
[02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:29.873]  He said, yeah, no, it was the BuzzFeeds and all of them howling and screaming, calling me a Russian agent right in front of everyone, stealing his speech, so afraid of what he might say.
[02:35:29.913 --> 02:35:30.953]  But they had to be there.
[02:35:31.713 --> 02:35:36.875]  Because he was the sacrificial lamb, the total penultimate trigger for the takedown of Trump.
[02:35:37.375 --> 02:35:39.656]  And now here we are and they couldn't get what they wanted.
[02:35:39.696 --> 02:35:45.559]  Jacob Ingalls, syndicated reporter, Twitter Jacob Ingalls at Twitter, centralfloridapost.com.
[02:35:46.399 --> 02:35:51.541]  I don't know how to describe how archetypal, how epic, how illustrative it is to have.
[02:35:52.001 --> 02:35:53.382]  We're on air within 30 minutes.
[02:35:53.462 --> 02:35:55.243]  I say when you go out there, they're going to shut you down.
[02:35:55.563 --> 02:35:56.743]  Talk about the attack on free speech.
[02:35:56.763 --> 02:35:58.084]  He goes out, they won't let him talk.
[02:35:59.525 --> 02:36:02.687]  He leaves, no press other than RuddReport.com picks us up.
[02:36:04.128 --> 02:36:07.711]  It's the discipline of the so-called press, but they're not the press.
[02:36:07.751 --> 02:36:08.552]  What would you call them?
[02:36:09.933 --> 02:36:10.753]  Killers of truth?
[02:36:11.053 --> 02:36:11.954]  Killers of language?
[02:36:12.014 --> 02:36:13.095]  False narrative projectors?
[02:36:13.135 --> 02:36:13.575]  What are they?
[02:36:14.716 --> 02:36:16.357]  They're activist propagandists.
[02:36:16.517 --> 02:36:23.302]  These are people who would have been the first hires for Joseph Goebbels as he was appointed Reich Minister of Propaganda in 1933 Germany.
[02:36:24.690 --> 02:36:26.171]  These people are not fair.
[02:36:26.231 --> 02:36:27.331]  They're not fair-minded.
[02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:28.832]  They're political acts.
[02:36:28.912 --> 02:36:31.313]  They're rubbing elbows with the Mueller team.
[02:36:31.753 --> 02:36:35.495]  They're infested by that corrupt swamp.
[02:36:35.964 --> 02:36:39.025]  So what they are is they're followers, they're regurgitators, they're repeaters.
[02:36:58.547 --> 02:36:59.848]  Yes, yes.
[02:36:59.888 --> 02:37:02.069]  Repeaters is a great word for them.
[02:37:02.289 --> 02:37:08.752]  They repeat everything that they hear from the deep state, from government operators and controllers, deep state minders.
[02:37:08.792 --> 02:37:11.293]  They don't have a single independent thought of their own.
[02:37:14.214 --> 02:37:17.596]  So, Roger is in the clutches and he's a tough guy.
[02:37:18.561 --> 02:37:22.083]  But with seven charges, we could tabulate up what he's facing.
[02:37:22.123 --> 02:37:27.967]  Decades in jail for no Russiagate, for supposedly lying to Congress, when it's very clear he didn't.
[02:37:28.007 --> 02:37:30.349]  He said, yeah, I was talking intermediary to WikiLeaks.
[02:37:30.369 --> 02:37:31.410]  I mean, here's the problem.
[02:37:31.430 --> 02:37:32.290]  I've said this a thousand times.
[02:37:32.310 --> 02:37:33.631]  The truth doesn't matter to these people.
[02:37:34.232 --> 02:37:34.772]  I was there.
[02:37:35.052 --> 02:37:36.353]  Everyone wanted WikiLeaks.
[02:37:36.813 --> 02:37:37.974]  WikiLeaks was all cool.
[02:37:37.994 --> 02:37:39.095]  LaSange was cool then.
[02:37:39.115 --> 02:37:41.357]  On every major news channel, he wouldn't talk to us.
[02:37:42.317 --> 02:37:43.298]  Stone, New Credit Co.
[02:37:43.338 --> 02:37:45.339]  and a bunch of others, you know, he works the media.
[02:37:45.860 --> 02:37:46.660]  He was trying to get a hold.
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:47.581]  I remember saying, Roger!
[02:37:48.686 --> 02:37:50.086]  Get Assange, or you interview him.
[02:37:50.106 --> 02:37:51.007]  It would be bigger, fine.
[02:37:51.027 --> 02:37:52.467]  Well, I hear it's really big.
[02:37:52.967 --> 02:37:53.587]  I hear all this.
[02:37:53.728 --> 02:37:54.488]  I was there.
[02:37:54.868 --> 02:37:55.888]  He was asking for a job.
[02:37:55.948 --> 02:37:59.329]  And I said, you get me Julian Assange exclusive, you've got your job.
[02:37:59.369 --> 02:38:02.450]  And back then, he was a Fox News contributor, paid $50,000 a year.
[02:38:02.470 --> 02:38:03.951]  He didn't want to make a big deal out of that.
[02:38:04.011 --> 02:38:06.771]  They've got hundreds of people on the payroll as a contributor.
[02:38:06.791 --> 02:38:08.752]  As soon as he worked for us, he lost his job at Fox.
[02:38:08.792 --> 02:38:10.532]  But I was hiring a Fox News contributor.
[02:38:11.433 --> 02:38:14.534]  You know, of course he used to work and write for Lou Dobbs at CNN.
[02:38:15.834 --> 02:38:18.495]  I'm getting the big-wig, anti-globalist guys hired.
[02:38:18.836 --> 02:38:26.919]  They turn that into this criminal thing we're involved in, and it's just like plastic banana, fake baloney, BS world.
[02:38:26.939 --> 02:38:44.048]  But what I'm getting at is, we don't take it serious because we know it's not true, but then it happens, and 29 SWAT team people attack the house to make it look like it's legitimate, and now Roger's confident now, but my God, next week he gets arraigned like Manafort a year ago, year and a half ago, walking into that
[02:38:44.608 --> 02:38:44.768]  That's
[02:39:05.376 --> 02:39:06.837]  If they fail this test, we're done.
[02:39:06.917 --> 02:39:08.358]  So I'm a big Trump booster.
[02:39:08.438 --> 02:39:08.878]  Help get him in.
[02:39:08.898 --> 02:39:09.599]  I think he's a great guy.
[02:39:09.639 --> 02:39:14.482]  But right now, I'm two by four upside the head saying, listen, get in gear, honcho.
[02:39:16.284 --> 02:39:16.924]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:39:16.984 --> 02:39:26.611]  And when I watch that footage that's being played behind you of the early morning raid by Robert Mueller, it reminds me of someone in the control center can pull it up.
[02:39:26.651 --> 02:39:28.832]  Let's pull up some footage of the pogroms.
[02:39:28.852 --> 02:39:30.213]  Let's pull up some footage of this.
[02:39:31.974 --> 02:39:32.835]  Yeah, let's hear the audio.
[02:39:32.855 --> 02:39:33.915]  In fact, start it over.
[02:39:33.935 --> 02:39:36.277]  Let's play the actual audio of them banging on the door.
[02:39:36.317 --> 02:39:43.401]  And thank God he showed up in 30 seconds or they'd have kicked it in.
[02:39:44.622 --> 02:39:50.426]  And CNN, the same group that's in the airports, the bars, that pays to be on air, there they are.
[02:39:52.887 --> 02:39:54.348]  God, talk about aiding the people.
[02:39:55.517 --> 02:39:58.186]  It's sick man.
[02:39:58.587 --> 02:40:02.239]  And I love how when you show up in a house, like in five seconds...
[02:40:04.232 --> 02:40:05.132]  You're not answering!
[02:40:05.192 --> 02:40:09.314]  I'm coming in, and thank God he got down there in 10 seconds, or they could have had even more.
[02:40:09.354 --> 02:40:19.457]  And it's like, can you imagine being those guys that have, like, with drug cartels and real criminals and stuff, they're like going to some dude with no criminal records house, and they've got to play along with this, or their FBI bosses will fire them.
[02:40:19.477 --> 02:40:21.058]  And you're like, well, we got to do it.
[02:40:21.158 --> 02:40:21.558]  You know what?
[02:40:21.598 --> 02:40:22.378]  You're not Americans.
[02:40:22.798 --> 02:40:23.598]  I didn't sell out.
[02:40:23.618 --> 02:40:24.919]  I don't want to hear your crap.
[02:40:25.139 --> 02:40:29.580]  You'll go fight in some foreign country and kill hajis all day because you're told to do it.
[02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:31.021]  But morally, you don't have courage.
[02:40:31.781 --> 02:40:34.103]  A lot of these guys, they're just idiots.
[02:40:34.464 --> 02:40:35.424]  Oh, they're real tough guys.
[02:40:35.444 --> 02:40:36.646]  You go pick on a Trump supporter.
[02:40:37.667 --> 02:40:51.399]  Well, and that's the thing, you know, I think there's a moral and ethical obligation for anybody who is asked as a member of the FBI SWAT team and that team that was sent in, you know, if you're a true patriot, you would have declined to carry out that duty.
[02:40:51.579 --> 02:40:53.942]  I mean, it's clearly a trumped up political charge.
[02:40:53.982 --> 02:40:54.942]  This is a witch hunt.
[02:40:55.543 --> 02:40:57.625]  And what they did is participate
[02:40:58.317 --> 02:40:59.658]  And contribute to it.
[02:40:59.698 --> 02:41:04.820]  So they are now collaborators, part of Robert Mueller's political persecution and witch hunt.
[02:41:05.160 --> 02:41:09.882]  And they are no different than he is right now, because they are acting as an extension of him.
[02:41:10.302 --> 02:41:14.744]  So I understand they think they're doing their job, but... Take the arrogance!
[02:41:14.784 --> 02:41:16.465]  They know they could have called, they would have picked him up.
[02:41:16.525 --> 02:41:18.206]  It was to make him look like a criminal.
[02:41:18.226 --> 02:41:20.667]  It's just, it's all incredibly transparent.
[02:41:22.292 --> 02:41:28.334]  100%.
[02:41:22.872 --> 02:41:28.334]  100%.
[02:41:23.312 --> 02:41:28.334]  This was a propagandist film project for the FBI.
[02:41:28.614 --> 02:41:29.794]  And who was the director?
[02:41:30.154 --> 02:41:31.774]  Who was the filmmaker?
[02:41:31.934 --> 02:41:32.955]  CNN.
[02:41:33.335 --> 02:41:34.875]  CNN claims that they got a tip.
[02:41:34.895 --> 02:41:36.916]  CNN claims that they knew to be there somehow.
[02:41:37.116 --> 02:41:39.496]  Why doesn't CNN release the source of that tip?
[02:41:41.557 --> 02:41:47.018]  So, CNN gets producer credit in Roger Stone's SWAT team raid?
[02:41:48.177 --> 02:41:49.177]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:41:49.478 --> 02:41:49.998]  Absolutely.
[02:41:50.018 --> 02:42:10.126]  I mean, again, this is no different than Joseph Goebbels enlisting filmmakers in the Third Reich to make propaganda films like Triumph of the Will and The Eternal Jew and all of these horribly harmful things that helped propagate this idea about Jewish people and the rise of the Third Reich and Nazism.
[02:42:10.506 --> 02:42:12.427]  Robert Mueller is following the same playbook.
[02:42:12.467 --> 02:42:16.309]  He is using his police state arm and then coordinating with CNN
[02:42:17.109 --> 02:42:29.157]  To produce this film production of force and brutal, brutal action against a very peaceful man, Roger Stone, and his wife, who were asleep with their dogs.
[02:42:29.597 --> 02:42:30.958]  And they could have just picked up the phone.
[02:42:30.998 --> 02:42:32.299]  All right, Jacob Ingalls, stay there.
[02:42:32.319 --> 02:42:34.060]  We're going to get you back on later in the show.
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:36.062]  I want to send you an external mic so we have better audio.
[02:42:36.082 --> 02:42:37.463]  But thank you for joining us.
[02:42:37.483 --> 02:42:39.224]  All right, final segment of this hour.
[02:42:39.284 --> 02:42:40.125]  Then we have a guest host.
[02:42:40.225 --> 02:42:41.025]  I'll be co-hosting.
[02:42:41.585 --> 02:42:42.306]  Then the war room.
[02:42:42.426 --> 02:42:43.106]  I'll be co-hosting.
[02:42:43.147 --> 02:42:44.387]  And Roger Stone joins us again.
[02:42:44.728 --> 02:42:46.369]  Jacob Ingalls is welcome to join us again.
[02:42:47.249 --> 02:42:48.952]  Big recaps straight ahead.
[02:42:49.012 --> 02:42:50.614]  This is history happening right now.
[02:42:50.634 --> 02:42:52.756]  And I told you, Rogers and the Crosshairs.
[02:42:53.157 --> 02:42:55.560]  Next, David Jones and Alex Jones.
[02:42:56.321 --> 02:42:57.762]  Ha ha ha!
[02:42:58.323 --> 02:42:58.704]  Yes!
[02:43:11.030 --> 02:43:14.993]  Robert Barnes is, again, one of the top lawyers in the country when it comes to this.
[02:43:15.514 --> 02:43:19.637]  He's represented major Hollywood stars in cases where they spent millions defending themselves.
[02:43:19.717 --> 02:43:21.199]  Some cases winning, some cases losing.
[02:43:21.219 --> 02:43:22.940]  Everybody knows about the Wesley Snipes case.
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:26.443]  But the point is, he's taking this pro bono because he says it's show, clear, cut.
[02:43:26.603 --> 02:43:28.084]  So, who are you zeroing in on?
[02:43:28.225 --> 02:43:29.766]  Or, I guess that's kind of inside baseball.
[02:43:29.986 --> 02:43:38.635]  So Reza, who was the former CNN producer, got fired last year for inflammatory comments but has a huge social media following and is constantly in the press.
[02:43:38.936 --> 02:43:40.518]  He called for these kids to be punched.
[02:43:41.058 --> 02:43:45.443]  He referred to the face of young Nick as, uh, what a punchable face.
[02:43:45.783 --> 02:43:47.866]  He has refused to retract any of his false libels.
[02:43:48.126 --> 02:43:50.849]  He's almost a guarantee to be sued next Monday.
[02:43:51.509 --> 02:43:56.975]  Following on that is going to be Maggie Haberman, if she doesn't retract her false statements calling for the kids to be expelled.
[02:43:57.715 --> 02:44:05.223]  After that, Michael Rapoport, who's on a TV show on Netflix against bullying of kids.
[02:44:05.603 --> 02:44:08.946]  And here he is bullying kids with homophobic rhetoric.
[02:44:09.246 --> 02:44:12.750]  He's going to get sued next week unless he takes corrective action.
[02:44:13.110 --> 02:44:26.159]  And then there's a range of other journalists, celebrities, and social media personalities that we've specifically called out and said they need to retract, they need to correct, they need to delete their offending tweet, or their offending comments, or retract their offending story.
[02:44:26.419 --> 02:44:32.103]  And if they do, they do within 48 hours, if they do by week's end, if they do by Friday at midnight, they won't be sued.
[02:44:32.464 --> 02:44:34.245]  Anyone who refuses to or doubles down,
[02:44:34.685 --> 02:44:39.007]  Chances are they will be sued, and chances are they'll be seeing a Kentucky jury within the year.
[02:44:39.027 --> 02:44:41.168]  They said that they stopped the Indian march.
[02:44:41.308 --> 02:44:41.869]  Didn't happen.
[02:44:42.109 --> 02:44:44.950]  Said they surrounded the Native American elder.
[02:44:45.170 --> 02:44:45.730]  Didn't happen.
[02:44:46.031 --> 02:44:48.312]  They said that they went up into his face.
[02:44:48.612 --> 02:44:49.192]  Didn't happen.
[02:44:49.452 --> 02:44:50.953]  They said they chanted build the wall.
[02:44:51.133 --> 02:44:51.733]  Didn't happen.
[02:44:51.993 --> 02:44:53.414]  Said they chanted racist slurs.
[02:44:53.674 --> 02:44:54.295]  Didn't happen.
[02:44:54.595 --> 02:44:59.177]  Said that they were mocking him, taunting him, using racist references.
[02:44:59.557 --> 02:45:00.117]  Didn't happen.
[02:45:00.257 --> 02:45:00.838]  Didn't happen.
[02:45:00.958 --> 02:45:01.478]  Didn't happen.
[02:45:01.778 --> 02:45:05.461]  They were the victim of a lot of those things, but they themselves didn't do any of that.
[02:45:05.762 --> 02:45:06.582]  It's part of a campaign.
[02:45:06.903 --> 02:45:09.485]  The campaign is to have people have thought control.
[02:45:09.885 --> 02:45:16.391]  The current cultural left and the media left and the corporate media left thinks very much like sort of the priests during the Inquisition era.
[02:45:16.751 --> 02:45:20.715]  So they're not concerned with independence of thought, with the irrationality of thought,
[02:45:21.195 --> 02:45:21.915]  We're good to go.
[02:45:38.021 --> 02:45:43.566]  has been independent voices who give voice to independent people who can reach large numbers of people like yourself.
[02:45:43.926 --> 02:45:56.116]  That's why there's been this collusion between the big tech social media giants and the big media press into suppressing and oppressing your voice because they need to make sure that ordinary people like these Covington kids don't have a defense.
[02:45:56.536 --> 02:46:06.785]  That they don't have lawyers like me defending them in court because I don't even know the case exists, because I don't even know the circumstances happened, because I don't have access to people like yourself who tell me what actually happened and what's true.
[02:46:07.225 --> 02:46:20.652]  And that's what is part of a broader goal and a broader objective to suppress speech, censor thought, control minds, control behavior, so that you only think what the cultural elites and the corporate media want you to think, rather than being independent and having access to the truth.
[02:46:20.732 --> 02:46:24.974]  I mean, it's like what Thomas Jefferson said way back, the best answer to a bad idea is a good idea in a debate.
[02:46:25.054 --> 02:46:29.616]  If you truly believe the truth and empirical value and moral virtue of your ideas, you're never afraid
[02:46:29.636 --> 02:46:30.157]  I don't know.
[02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:08.864]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.608 --> 02:47:42.616]  Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss, another kiss
[02:47:44.955 --> 02:47:52.058]  All right, Tom Pappard, TV station manager, co-host, great guy, is going to be hosting the next hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:52.098 --> 02:47:54.319]  And then the War Room's coming up with Owen Schroer.
[02:47:54.379 --> 02:47:56.000]  Roger Stone will be back on exclusively.
[02:47:56.940 --> 02:47:58.301]  I want to open the phones up now.
[02:47:58.421 --> 02:47:59.801]  Now, we got 20-something phone lines.
[02:47:59.821 --> 02:48:02.262]  We actually have like 100, but I see 20 on screen.
[02:48:02.302 --> 02:48:04.223]  So it's the Catch-22.
[02:48:04.303 --> 02:48:05.084]  I'll get to a lot of you.
[02:48:05.104 --> 02:48:12.347]  I won't get to some of you, but the toll-free number to join us today on this Friday global transmission
[02:48:13.757 --> 02:48:14.057]  It's 877-789-2539.
[02:48:14.077 --> 02:48:14.357]  877-789-2539.
[02:48:14.377 --> 02:48:15.158]  877-789-Alex.
[02:48:15.318 --> 02:48:25.183]  Now, let's just sit back and talk about what's really going on here right now.
[02:48:27.744 --> 02:48:38.350]  We've had foreign multinational corporations take over the United States back to 1921 with the founding of Pratt House in New York City.
[02:48:40.185 --> 02:48:42.566]  The British Empire had learned how to take over countries.
[02:48:42.886 --> 02:48:43.907]  It wasn't the British people.
[02:48:44.947 --> 02:48:45.868]  It was the elites they had.
[02:48:48.149 --> 02:48:49.810]  And they even funded the first talkies.
[02:48:50.770 --> 02:48:52.171]  The first talking movies in the 20s.
[02:48:52.191 --> 02:48:55.773]  Where everyone had British accents even if they weren't British.
[02:48:56.193 --> 02:48:58.314]  They called it an Atlantic accent.
[02:48:59.675 --> 02:49:02.316]  And they had the OSS forum that became the CIA in 47.
[02:49:02.416 --> 02:49:07.599]  And so America inherited the British Empire.
[02:49:08.618 --> 02:49:10.139]  And the corporate functions it had.
[02:49:11.540 --> 02:49:27.448]  And its job was to leverage or project or parlay that power into taking over China, Indochina, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, everything.
[02:49:29.330 --> 02:49:31.451]  But the brain of that system
[02:49:32.813 --> 02:49:39.579]  Was eugenicist set up in England, the U.S., and Europe that actually wanted to create a scientific dictatorship and get rid of the family.
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:47.587]  She had the military doctrines, the corporate doctrines, the banking doctrines, but they only cared about numbers and property.
[02:49:48.268 --> 02:49:51.951]  But the cultural brain was leftist.
[02:49:53.513 --> 02:49:54.173]  Left hand path.
[02:49:55.114 --> 02:49:57.676]  Left hand rise above.
[02:49:59.591 --> 02:50:08.978]  And so, at the end of the day, they were building this structure of power where these men just wanted power, but there was a spiritual implement that wanted to couple above it and have total control.
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:14.682]  And so, that's where we are today, on this planet.
[02:50:15.803 --> 02:50:26.131]  And that's why this thing has to be resisted, no matter what happens to us individually, because it is a child-killing, aborting, planet-killing, murdering system that anything it does is destructive.
[02:50:27.705 --> 02:50:29.065]  The left claims they want to protect the planet.
[02:50:29.085 --> 02:50:31.966]  They're the very ones with all their projects and programs killing the planet.
[02:50:34.047 --> 02:50:36.328]  Google says ban the word family just this week.
[02:50:36.888 --> 02:50:37.628]  This is here.
[02:50:38.408 --> 02:50:39.108]  This is happening.
[02:50:40.529 --> 02:50:42.810]  And so they're the globalists killing the nation state.
[02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:44.450]  They're the globalists taking over the countries.
[02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:46.351]  They're the globalists bankrupting people.
[02:50:46.391 --> 02:50:51.872]  So then they say, oh, Alex Jones and Donald Trump and Roger Stone, why they galvanize people.
[02:50:51.912 --> 02:50:53.593]  They energize the population.
[02:50:55.427 --> 02:50:59.551]  To believe in themselves and to believe in self-determination, let's call them Russians.
[02:51:01.553 --> 02:51:07.518]  And now in 2019, in late January, they've made their move.
[02:51:10.541 --> 02:51:16.627]  And people think of things as themselves, like, how am I going to do with my bank account?
[02:51:16.727 --> 02:51:20.250]  How am I going to do with the other peer pressure group I'm with on this?
[02:51:20.490 --> 02:51:21.171]  That's not what it's about.
[02:51:23.154 --> 02:51:36.760]  The peer pressure groups, the control arms, the systematic systems are peopled and commanded by a bunch of yes-men, who then go out and find others who will follow their orders to carry out the system.
[02:51:37.741 --> 02:51:48.326]  And this system is a America, freedom, Christian, family, free market, capitalist, ending thing.
[02:51:50.359 --> 02:51:57.184]  So fighting it with every fiber of your body is not some heroic action.
[02:51:58.405 --> 02:52:01.928]  It's like if somebody pushed your head underwater to drown you and you fought to get to the surface.
[02:52:01.948 --> 02:52:02.668]  That's not heroic.
[02:52:04.089 --> 02:52:05.110]  That's called life force.
[02:52:06.651 --> 02:52:12.436]  And so the one crime I have, the one skill I have, is I got a hell of a lot of life force.
[02:52:14.117 --> 02:52:15.318]  And I got a hell of a lot of will.
[02:52:19.133 --> 02:52:20.475]  In fact, I'm not just ready to die.
[02:52:24.959 --> 02:52:28.283]  Giving into these globalists is unlimited death.
[02:52:28.523 --> 02:52:30.365]  I can feel hell on the other side.
[02:52:30.926 --> 02:52:32.588]  In fact, I do this out of fear.
[02:52:33.709 --> 02:52:35.991]  There's no way to join them and get out of this.
[02:52:37.593 --> 02:52:38.995]  The only thing you can do is resist it.
[02:52:39.966 --> 02:52:42.749]  And those of you that have any discernment left will have chills up and down your spine.
[02:52:42.769 --> 02:52:43.790]  You need to go with God right now.
[02:52:43.810 --> 02:52:45.612]  You need to understand you can't beat this by yourselves.
[02:52:45.632 --> 02:52:47.133]  You need to ask for Jesus Christ right now.
[02:52:48.054 --> 02:52:49.976]  And you need to reach towards God with everything you've got.
[02:52:50.617 --> 02:52:57.905]  Now, there are those of us that have to stand in the gap to try to get time for people to wake up, and I'm willing to do it.
[02:52:57.945 --> 02:53:00.808]  But let me tell you, it ain't fun with this breathing down my neck.
[02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.542]  So I'm going to tell you right now, folks, you better decide which side you're on.
[02:53:04.562 --> 02:53:06.183]  You better do it forever.
[02:53:07.083 --> 02:53:15.409]  Because there are a lot of evil people that are on power trips that don't see what they're doing, who've turned themselves over to evil.
[02:53:16.590 --> 02:53:24.155]  And if you're intimidated by them, let me assure you, you're not going to like where you are as soon as this life ends.
[02:53:25.616 --> 02:53:30.539]  The Clintons, the Bushes, the Muellers, the people like this are followers.
[02:53:32.130 --> 02:53:34.771]  And they seek to create a world and culture of followers.
[02:53:37.132 --> 02:53:38.652]  And that's not what humanity is.
[02:53:38.692 --> 02:53:39.452]  We're trailblazers.
[02:53:39.472 --> 02:53:39.912]  We're leaders.
[02:53:41.833 --> 02:53:52.696]  So I'll tell you again, a lot of social climbers, a lot of cowards are going to look at me and say, look at you.
[02:53:52.716 --> 02:53:53.557]  You're under attack.
[02:53:54.537 --> 02:53:55.197]  Look at you.
[02:53:55.517 --> 02:53:56.658]  You're about to be destroyed.
[02:53:57.298 --> 02:53:57.678]  You're weak.
[02:54:02.890 --> 02:54:04.010]  You don't even see it, do you?
[02:54:05.691 --> 02:54:10.953]  As weak as I am, I've got the instinct to struggle like a plant towards the sun towards God.
[02:54:11.973 --> 02:54:13.754]  And you guys have given up on that.
[02:54:15.574 --> 02:54:21.616]  And as we blast off to the next level, I feel sorry that a lot of you aren't going to make it there with us.
[02:54:23.457 --> 02:54:27.278]  But those of you who could be black, you could be white, you could be old, you could be young, you could be
[02:54:29.170 --> 02:54:30.592]  You could be gay, you could be straight.
[02:54:31.193 --> 02:54:37.361]  If you love God and you love justice and you hear what I'm saying, it means you resonate with God.
[02:54:39.023 --> 02:54:43.168]  Doesn't mean you're perfect, none of us are, but in the final equation, you love justice.
[02:54:44.093 --> 02:54:45.554]  And you decide which side you're on.
[02:54:46.094 --> 02:54:47.295]  That's why this is all here.
[02:54:47.335 --> 02:54:48.336]  There's not just evil in the world.
[02:54:48.796 --> 02:54:56.201]  God made sure that there'd be platforms until the last minute, the last hour, always saying, we're here for you.
[02:54:57.282 --> 02:54:57.822]  We love you.
[02:54:58.563 --> 02:54:59.323]  We're inclusive.
[02:55:00.164 --> 02:55:01.004]  Life is inclusive.
[02:55:01.344 --> 02:55:02.145]  Don't go with Satan.
[02:55:03.906 --> 02:55:05.027]  And if you don't join with that,
[02:55:06.783 --> 02:55:07.744]  Then that's your decision.
[02:55:25.866 --> 02:55:38.873]  It's obscene to say, oh, will you please share the video links, the audio links, will you please tell people about the show, will you buy products to support us, that everything I do is about a win-win, like fish oil.
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:43.102]  Multivitamins and water filters, air filters.
[02:55:43.422 --> 02:55:50.766]  So they push drugs and DMT and PCP and Prozac and Ritalin and liquor and everything else.
[02:55:51.226 --> 02:55:55.709]  Everything they push is death at you and I'm just like air filters, water filters, vitamins, minerals.
[02:55:56.189 --> 02:56:00.412]  Everything I do is metaphysically because it's good for me too.
[02:56:01.325 --> 02:56:02.646]  Because that's how I'm charged.
[02:56:03.246 --> 02:56:04.027]  It's what I do.
[02:56:04.167 --> 02:56:05.688]  I can't cheat.
[02:56:06.348 --> 02:56:09.530]  You don't think I don't know the enemy's own operations, all their maps, all their plans.
[02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:14.933]  It's a weakness of mine that I won't project into it and actually look into what they do.
[02:56:14.973 --> 02:56:15.794]  But I do it.
[02:56:16.314 --> 02:56:17.195]  I do it when I have to.
[02:56:17.275 --> 02:56:19.416]  And it's not fun.
[02:56:19.576 --> 02:56:20.357]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:56:20.917 --> 02:56:21.417]  Here's the thing.
[02:56:21.577 --> 02:56:22.378]  I'm actually weak.
[02:56:24.279 --> 02:56:26.641]  I really should look into the enemy's mind more.
[02:56:27.853 --> 02:56:28.814]  I've promised I would.
[02:56:28.834 --> 02:56:31.756]  I've not had the will to do it lately, but I'm going to try.
[02:56:32.477 --> 02:56:32.997]  Maybe tonight.
[02:56:33.758 --> 02:56:34.599]  Maybe tonight.
[02:56:34.739 --> 02:56:35.840]  It's really horrible, though.
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:38.362]  You see what they're doing to kids and everybody.
[02:56:38.442 --> 02:56:41.284]  It's not fun.
[02:56:42.185 --> 02:56:43.085]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:56:45.006 --> 02:56:46.647]  And, but I'll do what has to be done.
[02:56:46.767 --> 02:56:48.747]  All I'm telling you is we need your prayers.
[02:56:48.807 --> 02:56:52.668]  We need your support now, not tomorrow, not next week, not next year.
[02:56:52.688 --> 02:56:53.229]  This is it.
[02:56:53.789 --> 02:57:00.151]  This is the big push for the decision on a planetary level, whether we are destroyed as a planet or whether we go to the next level.
[02:57:00.711 --> 02:57:03.872]  Our spirits, God's already gonna divide those up from the good for the bad.
[02:57:04.432 --> 02:57:06.333]  But this is an intergalactic quest.
[02:57:07.193 --> 02:57:08.433]  It's a great moment to be alive.
[02:57:08.453 --> 02:57:11.834]  And I'm just very blessed and very humbled to be here talking to you.
[02:57:11.954 --> 02:57:13.255]  And I just encourage you again,
[02:57:14.554 --> 02:57:18.457]  The power you have when you get excited and you get focused is unlimited.
[02:57:18.898 --> 02:57:26.824]  When you understand the potential you have and when you financially support us, going to mFootworkstore.com, when you get things you already need, it moves mountains.
[02:57:27.825 --> 02:57:34.771]  So I'm judging things right now, whether I stay at what level we're at or I go on the offense on what you do now at mFootworkstore.com.
[02:57:34.791 --> 02:57:38.735]  But I'll tell you this, individually, I'm not going to back down.
[02:57:39.517 --> 02:57:43.903]  Just when things are so dire, it seems weird to plug selling products, but that's the gas in our tank.
[02:57:43.963 --> 02:57:46.386]  If we don't do it, we're dead on the highway.
[02:57:47.348 --> 02:57:47.848]  Stay with us.
[02:57:47.868 --> 02:57:48.469]  Hour number four.
[02:57:55.802 --> 02:57:58.503]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:57:58.843 --> 02:58:04.744]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:58:05.265 --> 02:58:17.288]  TurboForce from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[02:58:20.729 --> 02:58:24.490]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[02:58:26.297 --> 02:58:29.078]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply.
[02:58:29.479 --> 02:58:32.400]  This is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[02:58:34.341 --> 02:58:36.962]  Perfect for work in the car or at home.
[02:58:37.523 --> 02:58:40.304]  Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[02:58:40.744 --> 02:58:42.145]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:58:53.138 --> 02:58:53.658]  Here's the thing.
[02:58:53.739 --> 02:58:55.099]  I know how metaphysics works.
[02:58:55.199 --> 02:58:56.320]  I know how the universe works.
[02:58:57.001 --> 02:58:59.062]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[02:59:00.263 --> 02:59:03.845]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:59:04.805 --> 02:59:08.027]  I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[02:59:09.248 --> 02:59:10.589]  And that would be a very true statement.
[02:59:11.449 --> 02:59:17.633]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[02:59:18.674 --> 02:59:20.135]  If I fight as hard as I can,
[02:59:21.913 --> 02:59:23.594]  And people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[02:59:25.075 --> 02:59:27.777]  You support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:59:28.198 --> 02:59:30.199]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[02:59:30.559 --> 02:59:31.680]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:59:32.841 --> 02:59:41.047]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are gonna look back and say, you know, when we struggled here, we made it.
[02:59:41.427 --> 02:59:45.630]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[02:59:46.191 --> 02:59:48.953]  We're proud of what we brought you and the whole family of InfoWars products.
[02:59:49.393 --> 02:59:50.534]  Without you, we won't be here.
[02:59:57.088 --> 03:00:01.309]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:01.690 --> 03:00:20.656]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.716 --> 03:00:29.438]  You know, I'm the most anti-suicide person in the world.
[03:00:29.458 --> 03:00:36.043]  But I gotta tell you, I love truth and life so much, I don't give a rat's behind what they do to me.
[03:00:37.624 --> 03:00:38.465]  I'm telling the truth.
[03:00:38.645 --> 03:00:39.165]  I love God.
[03:00:39.205 --> 03:00:39.725]  I love justice.
[03:00:39.846 --> 03:00:42.487]  And I'm ready to stand up for what's right.
[03:00:43.508 --> 03:00:46.290]  But I just wish the average American knew how much danger they were in.
[03:00:46.671 --> 03:00:47.771]  Tom Pappert's coming up.
[03:00:47.811 --> 03:00:53.075]  Let's listen to this incredible guitar with his synthesizer from 1984, Van Halen.
[03:00:53.215 --> 03:00:54.296]  I'll wait.
[03:01:03.111 --> 03:01:08.656]  It's tough.
[03:01:08.736 --> 03:01:17.163]  He's putting overdrive.
[03:01:18.687 --> 03:01:19.988]  The best part is at the end, though.
[03:01:21.549 --> 03:01:24.310]  There's that part right at the end with that guitar, with the synthesizer.
[03:01:24.831 --> 03:01:28.733]  I'm not even a synthesizer fan, but the way they play the two together, it's like Jimi Hendrix.
[03:01:28.753 --> 03:01:32.375]  You know, it's like, it's like along the Watchtower or a few other songs of Hendrix.
[03:01:32.455 --> 03:01:34.857]  It just, it hits this grind together.
[03:01:34.877 --> 03:01:43.602]  The two sounds, it's like... While everybody else is running around, groveling to the system,
[03:01:45.123 --> 03:01:48.344]  The card's full of decks, or the decks are full of cards.
[03:01:49.425 --> 03:01:51.906]  Somebody has got to say no to the bullies.
[03:01:55.347 --> 03:01:56.408]  What's that part at the end though?
[03:01:56.428 --> 03:01:58.389]  We've got another one in the computer, that's just the end of the song.
[03:01:59.389 --> 03:02:00.730]  We'll play it when we come back in the next segment.
[03:02:01.210 --> 03:02:10.554]  Tom Papert manages one of our great TV stations out there in the United States, out in Kansas, into Missouri, and he's here with us doing a great job at Real
[03:02:11.593 --> 03:02:12.493]  G.E.
[03:02:12.613 --> 03:02:14.854]  Trump, Facebook God Emperor Trump official.
[03:02:15.394 --> 03:02:18.875]  You know, we can sit back like this is a spectacle, but it's not really a spectacle, Tom.
[03:02:20.275 --> 03:02:23.936]  We are seeing them go after Roger Stone, former chief advisor to Trump.
[03:02:24.076 --> 03:02:25.296]  No Russia, no nothing.
[03:02:25.636 --> 03:02:29.737]  He tried to talk to WikiLeaks, and they think it's like parsing words.
[03:02:29.757 --> 03:02:30.557]  You read the indictment.
[03:02:32.198 --> 03:02:32.758]  Where is it?
[03:02:33.398 --> 03:02:34.858]  He said he talks with an intermediary.
[03:02:34.878 --> 03:02:35.698]  He always said that.
[03:02:35.738 --> 03:02:38.719]  So now, a journalist talking to someone while you're going to prison.
[03:02:40.592 --> 03:02:47.276]  Well, and there are those of us who remember, back in 2015-2016, WikiLeaks didn't even like InfoWars.
[03:02:47.336 --> 03:02:50.878]  For reasons that still confound me, they gave you guys the cold shoulder.
[03:02:51.218 --> 03:03:05.306]  And so now here we are, three years later, and Roger Stone, who has been a regular, I mean he's an employee of yours, he's been on InfoWars for years, now because he might have known something before the rest of the country at large, that is now a criminal.
[03:03:07.270 --> 03:03:13.756]  Believe me, we hear from the grand jury, everybody, they're like, he hired a reporter, it's payoff money.
[03:03:14.356 --> 03:03:21.583]  And you're just like, sitting back like, it's like so unreal, I don't even get angry at this point, I just say, who are these people?
[03:03:23.598 --> 03:03:24.559]  Well, that's the question.
[03:03:24.599 --> 03:03:32.563]  The only thing I can think is, and you talked about this, I've been listening to the show, they just must be doing anything they can to inspire fear in the president.
[03:03:32.883 --> 03:03:37.606]  WikiLeaks called this pure intimidation in their release, in their statement today.
[03:03:37.946 --> 03:03:39.227]  And that's all I can think it is.
[03:03:39.287 --> 03:03:40.467]  They're trying to scare you.
[03:03:40.527 --> 03:03:42.048]  They don't want you to be passionate.
[03:03:42.088 --> 03:03:43.289]  They want you to be scared.
[03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:45.110]  They want InfoWars to contract.
[03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:47.472]  They want everybody to be on the defensive.
[03:03:47.492 --> 03:03:58.501]  They want the president to be so afraid to do his job, because maybe he'll be indicted next, that he's just going to go soft and let them do whatever they want until they can get one of their guys back in there in a couple years.
[03:03:58.781 --> 03:04:05.727]  And it's just sickening that InfoWars and Roger Stone, they're trying to make you guys the sacrificial lamb to the slaughter here.
[03:04:06.147 --> 03:04:07.607]  It's absolutely horrifying.
[03:04:07.647 --> 03:04:11.328]  You know, when you wake up this morning, I had 30 texts saying, are you still being on?
[03:04:11.368 --> 03:04:13.089]  Did you know InfoWars just got indicted?
[03:04:13.109 --> 03:04:14.849]  Because people didn't know, is it Roger Stone?
[03:04:14.889 --> 03:04:15.689]  Is it Alex Jones?
[03:04:15.729 --> 03:04:19.010]  They just immediately heard something was going on at InfoWars.
[03:04:19.350 --> 03:04:25.112]  Then we find out Roger Stone gets a raid, pre-dawn raid, arrested again.
[03:04:25.412 --> 03:04:26.232]  Over what?
[03:04:26.392 --> 03:04:29.393]  You read the indictment, the whole thing doesn't even make sense.
[03:04:29.833 --> 03:04:40.245]  Roger Stone knew something about Party One, WikiLeaks, and he learned it through an intermediary, and he was both publicly and privately telling people that he knew this information.
[03:04:40.545 --> 03:04:42.948]  And then he tried to give it to the Trump campaign.
[03:04:43.989 --> 03:04:48.291]  So, information, this is thought crime, is essentially what I get from that indictment.
[03:04:48.511 --> 03:04:55.835]  They're trying to put the man in prison until he dies for the rest of his life, give him the Paul Manafort treatment because he knew something.
[03:04:56.215 --> 03:04:57.176]  This makes no sense.
[03:04:57.276 --> 03:05:00.517]  I don't see how in any type of rational society... No, you're right.
[03:05:00.557 --> 03:05:01.177]  Let's come back.
[03:05:01.217 --> 03:05:02.038]  I have the video clip.
[03:05:05.290 --> 03:05:08.575]  Now you've stayed vigilant, you've been pushing the site, and you've been helping us get it out there.
[03:05:08.675 --> 03:05:12.239]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[03:05:12.420 --> 03:05:16.605]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show, get that link out to everybody.
[03:05:16.725 --> 03:05:20.671]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil.
[03:05:20.831 --> 03:05:21.931]  We're good to go.
[03:05:47.162 --> 03:05:54.625]  TurboForce is the ultimate vitamin mineral, total energy, fusion, next level, total mega package, nothing else is even there.
[03:05:54.805 --> 03:06:00.568]  Get TurboForce today at InfoWarsWimes.com, but I recommend you only take half a dose the first time.
[03:06:00.668 --> 03:06:02.148]  Beware the power of TurboForce!
[03:06:02.168 --> 03:06:05.870]  So, it's a family show.
[03:06:16.849 --> 03:06:25.272]  But back in 2016, October 4th, we did an overnight show when Assange said he was going to release all this incredible information.
[03:06:27.433 --> 03:06:31.294]  Alex Jones slams Hillary buttplug Assange for October surprise letdown.
[03:06:31.675 --> 03:06:35.836]  So in that very show, I say, I've been contacting WikiLeaks.
[03:06:36.936 --> 03:06:38.477]  Roger Stone's been contacting him.
[03:06:38.497 --> 03:06:39.377]  He didn't work here yet.
[03:06:42.822 --> 03:06:44.224]  Everybody was trying to get us on, John.
[03:06:44.264 --> 03:06:45.626]  He was going on mainstream news.
[03:06:46.106 --> 03:06:47.288]  We're like, dude, release it.
[03:06:47.508 --> 03:06:48.529]  It's not about who gets it.
[03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:51.473]  It's that Hillary's illegal server showing all her crimes.
[03:06:51.513 --> 03:06:54.337]  But now, exposing Hillary's crimes is the big crime.
[03:06:54.577 --> 03:06:56.460]  The message is, you go to jail if you do this.
[03:06:59.246 --> 03:07:14.436]  I'm sorry to interrupt you Alex, but we all remember being up until 3, 4 in the morning watching InfoWars because Julian Assange put out a statement that there was going to be a big scoop delivered in a live Skype conference that he was going to deliver.
[03:07:14.676 --> 03:07:16.977]  We all stay up, we get trolled horribly.
[03:07:16.997 --> 03:07:21.600]  I still laugh about it or laugh slash cringe about it because the next day was absolute murder.
[03:07:21.900 --> 03:07:29.304]  But we all stayed up until the break of dawn for Julian Assange to deliver a mumbly, off-mic, bad audio book.
[03:07:29.324 --> 03:07:31.945]  Well, that's what I'm saying is the government knows.
[03:07:31.985 --> 03:07:32.725]  Well, why don't they know that?
[03:07:32.745 --> 03:07:36.487]  Because they're crooks covering up for Russiagate, which is on Hillary's side.
[03:07:36.547 --> 03:07:37.428]  So we were there.
[03:07:38.008 --> 03:07:39.329]  Assange never gave us the time of day.
[03:07:39.349 --> 03:07:49.534]  So the idea that talking to him is illegal, which he wouldn't even do, and then Roger lied about it, this is like indicting somebody for tying their shoelaces.
[03:07:50.751 --> 03:07:50.971]  Right.
[03:07:51.311 --> 03:07:58.613]  Well, and it makes me remember when CNN, they had the famous idiot on there who said, you know, only we, CNN, can read the WikiLeaks.
[03:07:58.773 --> 03:08:00.734]  It's illegal for you to read the WikiLeaks.
[03:08:00.794 --> 03:08:04.615]  At the time, we're all sitting there laughing about it, how comical that concept is.
[03:08:05.115 --> 03:08:09.976]  Maybe they knew something we didn't because essentially Roger Stone is guilty of reading the WikiLeaks.
[03:08:11.704 --> 03:08:15.568]  Yeah, that's the CNN reporter Cuomo saying, you can't read Wikileaks.
[03:08:15.728 --> 03:08:17.070]  Only we can read Wikileaks.
[03:08:17.090 --> 03:08:18.831]  And if you read Wikileaks, you'll go to jail.
[03:08:19.232 --> 03:08:21.174]  And I guess three years later, they're serious.
[03:08:21.234 --> 03:08:23.276]  Like, you don't read public documents.
[03:08:23.376 --> 03:08:24.037]  Only we can.
[03:08:25.566 --> 03:08:25.826]  Right.
[03:08:26.206 --> 03:08:34.751]  And again, it all comes down to Roger Stone heard from a buddy, a radio host, I believe, that they were going to release something.
[03:08:35.111 --> 03:08:39.373]  And so he texts all his friends, hey, I just heard they're going to release something over at WikiLeaks.
[03:08:39.433 --> 03:08:40.314]  It's exciting stuff.
[03:08:40.354 --> 03:08:41.714]  I can't wait to see what it's going to be.
[03:08:42.074 --> 03:08:43.635]  Like anybody in their right mind.
[03:08:43.795 --> 03:08:45.556]  Anybody in media teases it.
[03:08:45.616 --> 03:08:49.138]  I remember like Colin Roger going, because, well, I know this Randy Credico.
[03:08:49.158 --> 03:08:50.319]  I know some talk shows in New York.
[03:08:50.359 --> 03:08:50.779]  He knows him.
[03:08:50.799 --> 03:08:51.279]  It's going to be big.
[03:08:51.619 --> 03:08:52.640]  Assange was already singing.
[03:08:53.100 --> 03:08:54.121]  So here's Chris Cuomo.
[03:08:54.921 --> 03:08:58.884]  Mr. Hit-and-Drive extravaganza saying he can look at it, but you can't.
[03:08:58.944 --> 03:08:59.285]  Here it is.
[03:08:59.305 --> 03:09:05.310]  Also interesting to remember, it's illegal to possess these stolen documents.
[03:09:05.350 --> 03:09:06.330]  It's different for the media.
[03:09:06.350 --> 03:09:09.253]  So everything you learn about this, you're learning from us.
[03:09:09.513 --> 03:09:13.236]  And in full disclosure, let's take a look at what is in there and what it means.
[03:09:13.276 --> 03:09:14.177]  Joining us now, CNN.
[03:09:15.037 --> 03:09:18.821]  So it's illegal if you look at what Hillary's doing illegally.
[03:09:18.881 --> 03:09:21.583]  But I am Lord Cuomo, I can tell you.
[03:09:22.924 --> 03:09:29.371]  And you notice he said it's different for the media and of course CNN and the establishment gets to decide who is the media.
[03:09:29.672 --> 03:09:38.702]  Roger Stone has been working in either politics or media basically since he was 12 years old but because CNN determined that he is not media
[03:09:39.242 --> 03:09:40.123]  He broke the law.
[03:09:40.243 --> 03:09:42.145]  He wasn't allowed to tease this information.
[03:09:42.205 --> 03:09:44.167]  He wasn't allowed to know anything about it.
[03:09:44.468 --> 03:09:51.795]  InfoWars as a whole should have just ignored the WikiLeaks because you don't have your super secret CNN license to be a media.
[03:09:52.136 --> 03:09:54.338]  So therefore you should have just ignored the WikiLeaks.
[03:09:54.358 --> 03:09:57.641]  You should have just quoted CNN articles and that's all we would know about it.
[03:09:57.681 --> 03:09:59.083]  We wouldn't know about all of the
[03:09:59.523 --> 03:10:04.767]  Disturbing content that we won't even bring up for... I'm guessing you guys would get another lawsuit on your desk.
[03:10:04.807 --> 03:10:05.608]  I don't want to cause that.
[03:10:05.868 --> 03:10:08.190]  But all the disturbing content from those WikiLeaks.
[03:10:08.330 --> 03:10:11.693]  All of the New York Times admitting that they are hacks.
[03:10:11.753 --> 03:10:17.938]  The Politico reporters admitting, since I am a hack now, I will send my articles to you from now on so you can review them.
[03:10:18.258 --> 03:10:21.241]  They just expect that we should have sat down, ignored all of it.
[03:10:21.781 --> 03:10:29.505]  And because we didn't, that apparently gives them the opportunity to arrest Roger Stone in the most ridiculous way possible.
[03:10:29.965 --> 03:10:40.151]  I just hope that enough Americans watch this and then they read the CNN article where they're trying desperately to connect it to Russia like a crazy person trying to connect the dots that don't exist.
[03:10:40.211 --> 03:10:43.152]  Because obviously the indictment... So Tom, let me ask you this.
[03:10:43.192 --> 03:10:44.713]  We can argue how it's not Russia all day.
[03:10:44.733 --> 03:10:45.373]  Everybody knows that.
[03:10:45.693 --> 03:10:50.496]  Unless it's Mueller giving uranium to Russians or Hillary getting money from uranium, there's no Russia connection.
[03:10:51.056 --> 03:10:51.896]  Where do they go now?
[03:10:52.037 --> 03:11:09.125]  What's the calculus of Mueller in them to go ahead and go after Stone and do all of this and then have the media boo him so he doesn't have speech at his press conference pointing out we have the exclusives now, the video from the first hour of the second hour posted to InfoWars.com so you can hear what Roger Stone said.
[03:11:09.485 --> 03:11:11.366]  So how critical is that for listeners to go, wow,
[03:11:11.986 --> 03:11:15.208]  This is like, hear what the man they're indicted has to say.
[03:11:15.288 --> 03:11:17.350]  The media won't let you hear what Roger has to say.
[03:11:17.770 --> 03:11:19.571]  The media tried to boo him and shut down.
[03:11:19.891 --> 03:11:24.615]  The media shut down Roger Stone's press conference, so he gave one to InfoWars.
[03:11:24.955 --> 03:11:25.856]  Find out what he said.
[03:11:25.936 --> 03:11:26.316]  That's it.
[03:11:26.876 --> 03:11:29.658]  Exclusive interview with InfoWars' Roger Stone after arrest.
[03:11:29.718 --> 03:11:31.019]  It's all up there on the site.
[03:11:31.139 --> 03:11:33.501]  Imagine, they don't want him to have a voice.
[03:11:33.841 --> 03:11:35.282]  How un-American is that?
[03:11:35.322 --> 03:11:36.503]  How dangerous is that?
[03:11:37.523 --> 03:11:41.885]  Well, it just goes to show these guys are total morons because it's going to backfire.
[03:11:41.946 --> 03:11:43.747]  It got you guys tons of traffic, I'm sure.
[03:11:43.787 --> 03:11:50.730]  You had a DDoS attack, you had your streams go down because of that, and just the people trying to watch the show and see what Roger had to say.
[03:11:51.151 --> 03:12:01.056]  And if the media had any type of brain in their head at all, they would have shushed all their booing reporters down and let Roger speak there before the cameras so they could get the ratings.
[03:12:01.096 --> 03:12:03.618]  But instead, it's driving more and more people to InfoWars.
[03:12:03.638 --> 03:12:05.459]  And I have a sneaking suspicion
[03:12:05.979 --> 03:12:11.700]  Roger has been saying he fears he's going to be indicted for months now, and I think they were waiting for an opportune moment.
[03:12:11.760 --> 03:12:20.222]  If you look at the last seven, eight days, this has been possibly the worst week and a half for the media in recent memory, probably since Kavanaugh.
[03:12:20.503 --> 03:12:30.625]  First, it started with the BuzzFeed fiasco, where the deep state shill Robert Mueller himself had to come out and say, no, this is fake news, it does not correspond to our findings, ignore it.
[03:12:31.085 --> 03:12:40.952]  Then, the very next day, we get the Covington situation, where they're trying to frame a group of teenagers as vile, racist, anti-Semites, and that blew up in their face.
[03:12:41.252 --> 03:12:42.953]  So it's just been thing after thing after thing.
[03:12:42.993 --> 03:12:47.396]  They realized this Covington thing wasn't going away, so they thought, what can we do?
[03:12:47.696 --> 03:12:48.337]  Well, let's see.
[03:12:48.457 --> 03:12:49.898]  Let's just get Roger Stone.
[03:12:50.118 --> 03:12:51.699]  He's a former Trump advisor.
[03:12:51.739 --> 03:12:52.820]  He works at InfoWars.
[03:12:52.840 --> 03:12:54.021]  There's an Alex Jones connection.
[03:12:54.041 --> 03:12:54.941]  There's a Trump connection.
[03:12:55.262 --> 03:12:56.763]  He will be our distraction.
[03:12:56.983 --> 03:12:57.883]  And I think it's working.
[03:12:57.943 --> 03:13:00.085]  Now this is all anybody is going to talk about.
[03:13:00.425 --> 03:13:02.026]  No, I think you're right.
[03:13:02.046 --> 03:13:09.449]  By the way, we found the clip from October 2016 where I'm yelling at Assange for not releasing stuff, and then we're supposedly all in a mastermind operation together, which is total BS.
[03:13:09.469 --> 03:13:09.829]  Here it is.
[03:13:30.521 --> 03:13:33.844]  Trolling the world is Hillary's October surprise.
[03:13:33.884 --> 03:13:34.624]  Come on, Assange.
[03:13:34.684 --> 03:13:38.087]  Julian Assange is a Hillary buttplug.
[03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:43.372]  Legal counsel, Ben Jones.
[03:13:43.552 --> 03:13:45.413]  I think we have the title for tonight's news.
[03:13:48.416 --> 03:13:52.260]  And so I go on from there, but the idea that we're coordinating with him, I was there.
[03:13:52.400 --> 03:13:55.122]  It's like, you make you like, we laugh about this.
[03:13:55.222 --> 03:13:55.843]  It's not funny.
[03:13:55.903 --> 03:13:56.944]  Roger's been indicted.
[03:13:57.284 --> 03:14:01.108]  He's been SWAT teamed at his house, 29 armed people pointing guns at him.
[03:14:01.649 --> 03:14:07.234]  And then Mueller is on tarmacs giving uranium to the Russians and Hillary gets $130 million for it.
[03:14:07.294 --> 03:14:09.416]  It's just like, it's a sick joke, man.
[03:14:10.407 --> 03:14:12.270]  Well, and this reminds me of Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:12.290 --> 03:14:19.980]  You know, the only reason why she's not facing criminal charges is because Comey came up with a totally fictitious concept called intent.
[03:14:20.301 --> 03:14:23.425]  You see, yeah, she did some bad things, but she didn't mean to.
[03:14:23.785 --> 03:14:25.728]  So where is that with Roger Stone?
[03:14:25.888 --> 03:14:26.930]  I don't think Roger Stone
[03:14:28.231 --> 03:14:37.416]  I hope that Americans are seeing this glaring double standard.
[03:14:37.617 --> 03:14:39.238]  Hillary Clinton gets to walk free.
[03:14:39.338 --> 03:14:40.538]  Comey gets to walk free.
[03:14:40.578 --> 03:14:41.419]  They all lied.
[03:14:41.579 --> 03:14:42.220]  It came out.
[03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:44.961]  Now, I guess Comey, there's still a little bit of whether or not he lied.
[03:14:45.341 --> 03:14:45.702]  Exactly.
[03:14:45.722 --> 03:14:47.683]  You're going to take over for the next 45 minutes.
[03:14:48.223 --> 03:14:50.605]  And then, Owen Schroer, Roger Stone's going to be back.
[03:14:50.705 --> 03:14:51.465]  Global exclusive.
[03:14:51.705 --> 03:14:53.006]  He won't be booed off the air here.
[03:14:53.026 --> 03:14:55.128]  You'll actually get to hear what he has to say.
[03:14:56.223 --> 03:15:01.667]  Coming up at 3 o'clock Central Standard Time, in just about 45 minutes, Owen Schroer takes over.
[03:15:01.947 --> 03:15:04.909]  We have Tom Papert, again, at Real G.E.
[03:15:04.949 --> 03:15:06.771]  Trump and at Facebook.com.
[03:15:06.791 --> 03:15:08.132]  First, let's got in for a Trump official.
[03:15:08.752 --> 03:15:10.533]  Remember, everything we do is free to air, listeners.
[03:15:10.673 --> 03:15:11.834]  Everything we do, we want you to use.
[03:15:11.854 --> 03:15:12.635]  We want you to put it out.
[03:15:13.055 --> 03:15:17.158]  And remember, get some great supplements, get some great products, get some great t-shirts.
[03:15:17.558 --> 03:15:21.941]  You couldn't get a piece of Americana that's better than a t-shirt or something at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:15:22.862 --> 03:15:25.244]  Without you, we won't be here.
[03:15:25.284 --> 03:15:27.226]  TurboForce is our new product.
[03:15:27.246 --> 03:15:28.748]  BrainForce is our best-selling product.
[03:15:28.768 --> 03:15:29.449]  Great nootropic.
[03:15:30.429 --> 03:15:34.573]  This is a nootropic with a pre-workout energy stamina.
[03:15:35.014 --> 03:15:37.076]  It is redonkulously strong and powerful.
[03:15:37.116 --> 03:15:37.737]  No reviews yet.
[03:15:38.649 --> 03:15:40.809]  Because it just came out a few days ago.
[03:15:40.929 --> 03:15:44.350]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:45.470]  Get your Turbo Force.
[03:15:45.530 --> 03:15:47.351]  I see one pay-per-view there.
[03:15:47.891 --> 03:15:49.471]  Yeah, good luck to those people.
[03:15:49.511 --> 03:15:50.712]  It's not going to work.
[03:15:51.232 --> 03:15:52.212]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:15:52.252 --> 03:15:53.352]  You fund us, we keep fighting.
[03:15:53.372 --> 03:15:54.372]  You don't, we shut down.
[03:15:54.932 --> 03:15:55.653]  I'm in your hands.
[03:15:55.853 --> 03:15:57.193]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:15:57.353 --> 03:15:58.533]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:15:58.813 --> 03:15:59.553]  Spread the live links.
[03:15:59.653 --> 03:16:00.614]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:16:13.453 --> 03:16:25.167]  I recently saw a Gillette ad owned by Procter & Gamble that spent a minute and a half showing men as the enemy.
[03:16:25.787 --> 03:16:28.430]  That if a man tries to talk to a beautiful woman, he's a bad guy.
[03:16:28.530 --> 03:16:33.176]  Or if two kids get in a fight, somehow just men fighting, period, is evil.
[03:16:35.185 --> 03:16:48.251]  When you look at the Romans conquering civilizations where they would kill all the men, or you look at black slaves with the women being kept as the house service to suppress the men, you know that any authoritarian society seeking to dominate wants to suppress the men.
[03:16:49.552 --> 03:16:52.633]  Then you read the white papers, the Globalist, that's exactly what they're doing.
[03:16:54.394 --> 03:16:57.155]  So men have now learned that this is happening.
[03:16:57.756 --> 03:17:04.339]  And there are chemicals added to the water, added to the food, to try to suppress their normal drive, their normal ethos, who they are.
[03:17:05.694 --> 03:17:11.598]  And that's why online, herbs and supplements known to boost libido, stamina, and energy are such best sellers.
[03:17:11.638 --> 03:17:13.739]  That's why I'm getting into that market.
[03:17:14.980 --> 03:17:23.506]  Six, seven years ago, as a producer, I went out and found the most powerful formulas out there to not just give men, but also women, a boost.
[03:17:24.066 --> 03:17:26.408]  Super male, super female vitality.
[03:17:26.808 --> 03:17:31.972]  No one else produces a herbal formula that's cold-pressed and then aged.
[03:17:33.078 --> 03:17:35.820]  Like this group does in Utah.
[03:17:36.781 --> 03:17:41.885]  And they've had so much trouble getting the wild sourced herbs that I'm having to discontinue it.
[03:17:42.925 --> 03:17:45.687]  Now they've said maybe in a year, maybe in two, they can bring it back.
[03:17:45.747 --> 03:17:50.051]  But right now, this is the last run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[03:17:50.091 --> 03:17:50.551]  It's 50% off.
[03:17:50.651 --> 03:17:54.214]  Even though it's selling out, I want you to experience what God gave us.
[03:17:55.694 --> 03:17:56.274]  Through nature.
[03:17:56.314 --> 03:17:59.656]  But regardless, if you're depressed, go out and go for a hike.
[03:18:00.497 --> 03:18:03.999]  If you feel like you're a loser, you know, go out and help people at a soup kitchen.
[03:18:04.799 --> 03:18:08.021]  Because all the studies show, giving is better than receiving.
[03:18:08.841 --> 03:18:11.103]  You've given to us in incredible ways at InfoWars.
[03:18:11.143 --> 03:18:16.626]  You've supported us, you've been demonized for us, you've bought our products, and you've been fulfilled by it.
[03:18:16.666 --> 03:18:17.546]  You've seen great results.
[03:18:17.806 --> 03:18:18.747]  And I thank you for that.
[03:18:19.844 --> 03:18:28.450]  But when I bring on a product, I want to make sure it's the very best I can for you at the very best price, because I appreciate what you're doing, and I believe in the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[03:18:29.450 --> 03:18:30.591]  So I salute you, I thank you.
[03:18:30.611 --> 03:18:38.937]  I just want to encourage you to get the last run in the foreseeable future, hopefully it comes back, of super male vitality and super female vitality.
[03:18:39.557 --> 03:18:46.382]  You know, it's funny, the price went up and up and up for it, and it is a great formula and a bestseller with 4,000 plus five-star reviews, but
[03:18:47.282 --> 03:18:53.384]  Well, for the last year, I couldn't get resupplied, and I said, I'm not going to buy it for the last six months, and now we're in discussions.
[03:18:53.424 --> 03:19:02.627]  Maybe the herbs can be gotten, and it is hard, but the point is, is that I'm giving you such a low price that what I'm selling it to you for becomes cost prohibitive to bring you something like this.
[03:19:03.188 --> 03:19:08.249]  We brought out powdered versions that are even stronger, but are powdered and organic, but not cold-pressed.
[03:19:08.609 --> 03:19:09.790]  People like them, but not as much.
[03:19:10.330 --> 03:19:13.233]  Because there's something about super male and super female vitality.
[03:19:13.253 --> 03:19:18.498]  So get the last available bottles at EnforcedStore.com or call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[03:19:18.538 --> 03:19:21.161]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're proud of these products.
[03:19:21.321 --> 03:19:22.602]  We're proud of what we've done.
[03:19:22.622 --> 03:19:24.524]  I know I'm under scrutiny.

[03:19:39.098 --> 03:19:46.264]  So, be part of history, get a t-shirt, get a book, get some of the supplements, and know you're funding the second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[03:19:46.944 --> 03:19:51.508]  Super male and super female vitality, 50% off for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:51.628 --> 03:19:52.049]  Thank you all.
[03:20:06.279 --> 03:20:08.890]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.817 --> 03:20:34.878]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:35.078 --> 03:20:41.479]  I am Tom Pappert, your guest host for this hour, filling in for Alex Jones on today, an absolutely insane day.
[03:20:41.579 --> 03:20:54.342]  Roger Stone raided at his Florida home, arrested out on a $250,000 bond for what are essentially process crimes relating to statements that he may have given to Congress that may have been incorrect.
[03:20:54.782 --> 03:20:59.567]  It is frankly startling to see this happening in America, and I think the timing says it all.
[03:20:59.607 --> 03:21:05.252]  But before Alex had to step out, we were just talking about Wikileaks and their statement on this.
[03:21:05.332 --> 03:21:11.398]  And Wikileaks, of course, as I made the case, they've never really been a big fan or proponent of InfoWars.
[03:21:11.778 --> 03:21:16.401]  Yes, InfoWars reported on their leaks, as did literally everyone else in the media.
[03:21:16.641 --> 03:21:23.406]  If you were a journalist who ignored the WikiLeaks back in 2016, when it was all coming out almost weekly, you would have been a hack.
[03:21:23.446 --> 03:21:24.907]  You would have been a terrible journalist.
[03:21:24.927 --> 03:21:26.588]  You would have been fired from your job.
[03:21:26.848 --> 03:21:29.230]  And InfoWars did their responsible thing by putting it out.
[03:21:29.850 --> 03:21:33.914]  This is the official statement from WikiLeaks United States lawyer.
[03:21:34.114 --> 03:21:46.525]  They said the military-style dawn arrest of Mr. Stone, a 66-year-old political consultant, was wholly unnecessary and served no purpose other than intimidation.
[03:21:46.846 --> 03:21:48.107]  The charges against Stone
[03:21:49.424 --> 03:21:59.550]  Do not allege that Stone lied about his lack of contacts with Julian Assange, but rather about his contacts with others and documents reflecting those communications.
[03:21:59.590 --> 03:22:03.573]  So again, you have WikiLeaks doubling, tripling down on this idea.
[03:22:03.833 --> 03:22:05.594]  They are not InfoWars fans.
[03:22:05.654 --> 03:22:09.837]  They are not working with Alex Jones or InfoWars or Roger Stone.
[03:22:10.257 --> 03:22:14.358]  And if you look at Julian Assange's politics, that might have something to do with it.
[03:22:14.418 --> 03:22:24.560]  He leans a little bit closer to Bernie Sanders and Alexandria occasional cortex than he does the libertarian, conservative, paleo-conservative Alex Jones.
[03:22:25.141 --> 03:22:26.901]  That could have something to do with it.
[03:22:27.261 --> 03:22:38.804]  But it is absolutely stunning to see the media, which Julian Assange was their favorite person in the world when he was exposing the war crimes of George W. Bush, when he was putting out leaks that hurt Republicans,
[03:22:39.284 --> 03:22:40.024]  They loved him.
[03:22:40.164 --> 03:22:41.445]  He would go on CNN.
[03:22:41.525 --> 03:22:42.985]  He would go on MSNBC.
[03:22:43.105 --> 03:22:44.666]  He was the darling.
[03:22:44.966 --> 03:22:47.207]  And then Hillary Clinton lost.
[03:22:47.667 --> 03:22:57.951]  And now we have to do anything we can to frame it all about Russia, turn Julian Assange into enemy number one, Alex Jones into enemy number two, Roger Stone into enemy number three,
[03:22:58.866 --> 03:23:01.228]  And that is where we are left today.
[03:23:01.248 --> 03:23:08.876]  A man who is 66 years old, dedicated his entire life to this country, to trying to restore it to what he knew as a child.
[03:23:09.096 --> 03:23:12.819]  He was a Goldwater fan, he was a Reagan fan, he was a Trump fan.
[03:23:13.079 --> 03:23:14.241]  He has to go.
[03:23:14.261 --> 03:23:19.846]  And there's a lot of fears that he's going to be getting the Paul Manafort treatment.
[03:23:20.186 --> 03:23:23.808]  Where he will go into a federal facility and he will never be seen again.
[03:23:24.228 --> 03:23:29.671]  Now of course, Roger Stone, fortunately, is from what, as he likes to refer to it as, the old school.
[03:23:29.952 --> 03:23:37.556]  He's promised numerous times that regardless of the lies, the charges, the lawyer fees, he is not going to flip on the President.
[03:23:37.896 --> 03:23:40.138]  And I think he's a man of his word when it comes to this.
[03:23:40.198 --> 03:23:45.061]  I think Roger Stone has a bit more of a spine than that crooked lawyer.
[03:23:45.081 --> 03:23:47.383]  We won't even dignify him by saying his name.
[03:23:47.743 --> 03:23:52.427]  And for its part, I will say the administration is doing a bit more than they might have.
[03:23:52.447 --> 03:23:58.091]  You had Sarah Sanders come out and say, does this same standard apply to Hillary Clinton?
[03:23:58.371 --> 03:24:04.534]  Where Roger Stone may or may not have broken a law by lying by omission, essentially is what they're saying.
[03:24:04.574 --> 03:24:08.195]  They're saying that he lied to Congress, therefore he has to die in prison.
[03:24:08.215 --> 03:24:19.220]  Of course, as I mentioned in the last segment with Alex, Hillary Clinton, the only reason why she's not facing criminal charges is because you had Comey come up with this fantastic concept called intent.
[03:24:19.660 --> 03:24:24.906]  So you see, if you rob a bank but you didn't have malicious intent, then you're okay, right?
[03:24:25.166 --> 03:24:25.647]  No, no.
[03:24:25.727 --> 03:24:26.668]  That is a concept.
[03:24:26.708 --> 03:24:32.734]  That is a legal fabrication that only exists for Democrats named Hillary Clinton.
[03:24:33.035 --> 03:24:34.616]  It does not exist for Paul Manafort.
[03:24:34.716 --> 03:24:37.680]  It does not exist for Roger Stone.
[03:24:38.400 --> 03:24:44.545]  And then, of course, President Trump did tweet out early this morning, this is the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country.
[03:24:44.785 --> 03:24:45.886]  No collusion.
[03:24:46.286 --> 03:24:50.809]  Border coyotes, drug dealers, and human traffickers are treated better.
[03:24:50.990 --> 03:24:51.710]  Absolutely true.
[03:24:51.730 --> 03:24:52.471]  Where's Rogers?
[03:24:52.531 --> 03:24:53.291]  Catch and release.
[03:24:53.812 --> 03:24:56.173]  Who alerted CNN to be there?
[03:24:56.374 --> 03:24:58.015]  The president concluded on Twitter.
[03:24:58.355 --> 03:25:00.256]  And there is something to be said.
[03:25:00.497 --> 03:25:02.118]  I think tweeting is a little
[03:25:03.228 --> 03:25:06.210]  Too little too late when it comes to this stage of the game.
[03:25:06.510 --> 03:25:09.151]  You have longtime associates of President Trump.
[03:25:09.551 --> 03:25:13.874]  Roger Stone has known him since at least the 1980s, maybe earlier, we don't know.
[03:25:14.794 --> 03:25:19.997]  Longtime associates of President Trump being hauled away in the pre-dawn light.
[03:25:20.277 --> 03:25:24.860]  CNN celebrating, figuratively dancing on his grave already.
[03:25:25.320 --> 03:25:27.081]  And the President did put out a tweet.
[03:25:28.012 --> 03:25:32.074]  But then that seems to be about it, which is disappointing.
[03:25:32.434 --> 03:25:34.415]  So we're going to keep talking about this for the rest of the segment.
[03:25:34.455 --> 03:25:36.196]  Next segment, we're going to be taking your calls.
[03:25:36.236 --> 03:25:38.457]  We've got Thomas in Texas, Freddie in California.
[03:25:38.497 --> 03:25:41.378]  People have been holding for 40 minutes, so we've got to try to get some of these people in.
[03:25:41.418 --> 03:25:41.938]  I feel bad.
[03:25:42.618 --> 03:25:46.500]  But I do want to remind everybody that Alex needs support right now.
[03:25:46.700 --> 03:25:50.302]  I can only imagine how crushing these legal bills are going to be.
[03:25:50.422 --> 03:25:52.303]  Obviously, Roger Stone does too.
[03:25:52.443 --> 03:25:55.124]  StoneDefenseFund.com to support Roger Stone.
[03:25:55.564 --> 03:26:02.890]  Get a Roger Stone, the small pebble that is an exact replica of the one David used to defeat Goliath.
[03:26:02.930 --> 03:26:09.476]  And I think right now, that is perhaps more accurate of a synopsis of what's happening here than it ever has been.
[03:26:09.776 --> 03:26:13.519]  You have Roger Stone, again, political consultant, media figure.
[03:26:13.840 --> 03:26:15.101]  Everybody loves this guy.
[03:26:15.261 --> 03:26:18.884]  CNN used to love to have him on because he was an entertaining guest!
[03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:23.033]  And now he is going up against the true Goliath.
[03:26:23.073 --> 03:26:29.059]  He's going up against Robert Mueller, possibly the most powerful man in this country.
[03:26:29.419 --> 03:26:31.661]  Mueller has the power to do anything he wants.
[03:26:31.941 --> 03:26:33.443]  He's completely unchecked.
[03:26:33.703 --> 03:26:35.505]  President Trump's new Department of Justice.
[03:26:36.285 --> 03:26:38.487]  He's not going to rein him in.
[03:26:38.647 --> 03:26:41.550]  He's already come out publicly and said, no, I love Mueller.
[03:26:41.610 --> 03:26:43.331]  Our wives used to go knit together.
[03:26:43.371 --> 03:26:44.352]  We're best friends.
[03:26:44.633 --> 03:26:46.794]  I consider Mueller a brother practically.
[03:26:47.355 --> 03:26:51.538]  So we have this unelected person who many feel he was
[03:26:52.859 --> 03:26:55.000]  A little heartbroken, let's say.
[03:26:55.220 --> 03:26:58.982]  Felt a little burned by President Trump when he didn't give him Comey's old job.
[03:26:59.342 --> 03:27:05.945]  And so he's turned his life into destroying the President, destroying the prosperity of this country, and destroying anybody related to the President.
[03:27:05.985 --> 03:27:15.489]  And if you go back to 2015 and 2016, when Roger first started appearing on the Alex Jones Show, this man has put in the serious hours here.
[03:27:15.910 --> 03:27:18.651]  And this is something that I think a lot of conservatives are starting to feel.
[03:27:19.508 --> 03:27:23.191]  We've dedicated our lives to making the country great again.
[03:27:23.291 --> 03:27:28.716]  We've dedicated our lives to helping the president, to getting him elected, to putting his message out there.
[03:27:29.469 --> 03:27:35.093]  And we, in return, are, a lot of us, financially worse off than we were three years ago.
[03:27:35.153 --> 03:27:46.262]  It's great to see the country at large do better, but it's not so great to see Alex Jones, one of the driving engines behind this movement, be sacrificed.
[03:27:46.342 --> 03:27:51.766]  First it was social media, then they came after his finances, attacking his payment processors and everything else.
[03:27:52.147 --> 03:27:59.012]  Now they're arresting his employees, and again, the Jerome Corsi thing, where they just paid off his contract, which is
[03:27:59.312 --> 03:28:01.713]  Fairly standard in this industry, I can tell you.
[03:28:02.473 --> 03:28:04.273]  Now they're saying that was hush money.
[03:28:04.333 --> 03:28:14.176]  They delivered a giant cash payment to Jerome Corsi to try to prevent him from communicating with Bob Mueller and throwing Stone and Jones under the bus.
[03:28:14.556 --> 03:28:17.617]  It's all reaching some kind of apex here.
[03:28:17.637 --> 03:28:23.659]  We're going to... I've never before heard of this country being so divided, so built on fake news.
[03:28:24.602 --> 03:28:28.523]  I don't know where it's coming, but I do know that InfoWars is going to need your financial support.
[03:28:28.543 --> 03:28:30.343]  Again, it's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:28:30.503 --> 03:28:32.884]  I am a big proponent of all of the supplements.
[03:28:33.264 --> 03:28:38.645]  If you remember me coming on last summer in August, I was a big guy back then.
[03:28:39.005 --> 03:28:44.467]  Much smaller now, and I owe a lot of that no small part to the supplements provided at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:28:44.507 --> 03:28:45.507]  Super Male Vitality.

[03:28:59.716 --> 03:29:01.777]  I'm Tom Pappert, Facebook's God Emperor Trump.
[03:29:01.798 --> 03:29:02.398]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:29:05.222 --> 03:29:07.923]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.

[03:30:11.685 --> 03:30:15.127]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[03:30:15.388 --> 03:30:19.650]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[03:30:20.091 --> 03:30:23.353]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[03:30:24.253 --> 03:30:34.499]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.

[03:31:03.274 --> 03:31:06.578]  Now you've stayed vigilant, you've been pushing the site, and you've been helping us get it out there.
[03:31:06.658 --> 03:31:10.243]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[03:31:10.423 --> 03:31:14.629]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show, get that link out to everybody.
[03:31:14.729 --> 03:31:18.654]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil.
[03:31:18.834 --> 03:31:20.035]  We're good to go.
[03:31:45.054 --> 03:31:46.175]  Because we need border security.
[03:31:46.215 --> 03:31:46.936]  We have to have it.
[03:31:46.956 --> 03:31:49.238]  Should have happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.
[03:32:08.792 --> 03:32:09.773]  And it's gonna happen now.
[03:32:10.253 --> 03:32:10.854]  Gonna happen now.
[03:32:10.894 --> 03:32:12.095]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[03:32:12.715 --> 03:32:14.076]  Enjoy your food.
[03:32:14.276 --> 03:32:20.301]  There's the juxtaposed of golden candlestick holders with candles and then all this fast food.
[03:32:20.441 --> 03:32:21.582]  Trump is ridiculous.
[03:32:22.062 --> 03:32:23.844]  He's the ultimate joker card.
[03:32:26.005 --> 03:32:29.768]  But meanwhile, he says we've got burgers stacked a mile high.
[03:32:30.069 --> 03:32:32.911]  They spit it that he's lying when it's a figure of speech.
[03:32:33.846 --> 03:32:39.431]  And I didn't see anybody complaining when Barack Obama was spending $65,000 on hot dog dinners.
[03:32:40.051 --> 03:32:48.418]  Nobody cared to mention that in the mainstream press or ridicule him, and Obama always made a big deal of going out for fast food, or the press did at least when he did.
[03:32:48.438 --> 03:32:48.919]  Oh, it's well known.
[03:32:48.959 --> 03:32:52.342]  Trump likes tacos, and Obama likes winners.
[03:33:05.724 --> 03:33:11.885]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.488 --> 03:33:28.229]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[03:33:28.569 --> 03:33:32.770]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:36.753 --> 03:33:38.514]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:38.654 --> 03:33:42.957]  I am Tom Paffert, Facebook's God Emperor Trump, guest hosting this fourth hour.
[03:33:42.977 --> 03:33:45.199]  We're going to be taking your calls here in a few minutes.
[03:33:45.259 --> 03:33:48.301]  Lots of people have been holding for coming up on 45 minutes now.
[03:33:48.841 --> 03:33:56.586]  But I was just rereading CNN's basic misunderstanding of today's events, and it's stunning.
[03:33:56.727 --> 03:33:58.748]  This is the title of CNN's take on events.
[03:33:58.828 --> 03:34:04.672]  Why Roger Stone's stunning indictment is a huge moment in the Russia probe.
[03:34:05.072 --> 03:34:11.076]  And again, anybody who actually took the time to read this crazy indictment knows it has absolutely nothing to do with Russia.
[03:34:11.316 --> 03:34:15.199]  The whole concept that it has anything to do with Russia is beyond me.
[03:34:15.239 --> 03:34:18.761]  It has to do with speaking to Congress, and did he know about WikiLeaks?
[03:34:19.081 --> 03:34:26.606]  And so I guess maybe CNN is trying to make the argument that WikiLeaks is a Russian agent, which is totally unproven, totally unprovable.
[03:34:27.046 --> 03:34:39.395]  But if you sit here and you look at this, they go back to Trump joking at a rally, saying, I think if the Russians could find those 30,000 missing emails, they would be mightily rewarded.
[03:34:39.855 --> 03:34:52.324]  And so what this essentially comes down to is they're alleging that President Trump, then candidate Trump, colluded with the media to get the inside scoop on a story before anyone else had it.
[03:34:52.364 --> 03:34:52.985]  I think that's
[03:34:53.385 --> 03:34:57.475]  Possibly the simplest thing to put this up to, to condense this down to.
[03:34:57.816 --> 03:35:01.665]  But we know from the very WikiLeaks that this controversy is about...
[03:35:02.904 --> 03:35:04.725]  Hillary Clinton did exactly that.
[03:35:04.986 --> 03:35:18.315]  She had a Politico reporter in her email saying, because I am now a hack, I will deliver all my stories to the Clinton campaign to be proofread before I go public with them.
[03:35:18.355 --> 03:35:19.296]  That's Politico.
[03:35:19.416 --> 03:35:23.119]  The guy was later fired from Politico, got a job at the New York Times.
[03:35:23.499 --> 03:35:27.382]  This is mainstream media colluding with the Clinton campaign.
[03:35:27.702 --> 03:35:30.965]  Ten times worse than what Roger allegedly did.
[03:35:31.900 --> 03:35:35.922]  But, of course, that doesn't matter, because they have Democrat privilege.
[03:35:35.962 --> 03:35:37.563]  So let's start taking some of your calls.
[03:35:37.663 --> 03:35:41.105]  First, we have Thomas in Texas, and it's not just because I love your name.
[03:35:44.027 --> 03:35:44.547]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:35:44.567 --> 03:35:45.488]  Thomas, welcome to the show.
[03:35:46.408 --> 03:35:47.549]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[03:35:49.270 --> 03:35:58.475]  My opinion is not going to be very popular, but I've worried since the day Roger Stone got on Alex's show that he was sent to Alex because Alex is the real target.
[03:36:00.979 --> 03:36:07.064]  Well, and see, I get where you're coming from, because we all have to worry about these bad agents in our midst, right?
[03:36:07.084 --> 03:36:08.846]  I mean, that is a very real fear.
[03:36:08.906 --> 03:36:19.114]  But if you look at Roger Stone's track record, worked with Trump since 1987 at least, helped Trump plan his exploratory committee to run for president in 2000.
[03:36:19.394 --> 03:36:21.256]  It was instrumental in getting him
[03:36:21.796 --> 03:36:26.419]  To actually run in 2015 on June 16th when he announced.
[03:36:26.439 --> 03:36:28.500]  So I had met Roger twice now.
[03:36:28.741 --> 03:36:33.724]  Once in person, we just happened to bump into each other on the street in Cleveland during the Republican National Convention.
[03:36:34.004 --> 03:36:38.247]  And then once last summer when I was co-hosting with Alex Jones there in Austin, Texas.
[03:36:38.607 --> 03:36:42.830]  I can assure everybody at home who is wondering, how is this happening?
[03:36:42.890 --> 03:36:45.792]  How does this keep happening to people who Alex Jones knows?
[03:36:46.972 --> 03:36:49.174]  Roger is the real deal, but
[03:36:49.864 --> 03:36:57.727]  I definitely think they're trying to go down and find anybody they can close to Alex, because they want to make Alex fearful.
[03:36:57.787 --> 03:37:00.188]  They want to make his operation contract.
[03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:09.853]  And again, that's why everybody needs to look past all of this ridiculousness, all the fake news, all the allegations, all the lies, and keep going to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:37:09.873 --> 03:37:13.054]  Thomas, did I get, did I answer or kind of respond to you correctly?
[03:37:13.866 --> 03:37:17.188]  Well, the reason I suggest that is Alex is so powerful.
[03:37:17.328 --> 03:37:22.691]  He's the reason I got involved in politics and I made waves just in my local community all the way up to national.
[03:37:23.312 --> 03:37:31.796]  And I think they know that he has a grip on America as far as letting us, kind of beating us over the head to wake us up to what they're really doing.
[03:37:31.937 --> 03:37:34.578]  And they want to shut him down by any means necessary.
[03:37:34.598 --> 03:37:37.640]  That's why I have always suspected that Roger was sent to him.
[03:37:37.680 --> 03:37:39.161]  Roger's been in politics since the 60s.
[03:37:40.222 --> 03:37:43.774]  So he knows how to manipulate, and I don't know, I've just never trusted him.
[03:37:44.115 --> 03:37:46.844]  And I think the whole dog and pony show was more for Alex.
[03:37:48.596 --> 03:37:51.178]  Well, I definitely think that they're going to Roger.
[03:37:51.198 --> 03:37:52.940]  They're trying to take him out to get to Alex.
[03:37:53.280 --> 03:37:58.684]  But if you look at Roger's track record, it's not like he was supporting George Herbert Walker Bush.
[03:37:58.704 --> 03:38:00.105]  You know, he was a Goldwater guy.
[03:38:00.185 --> 03:38:01.346]  He was a Reagan guy.
[03:38:01.646 --> 03:38:12.155]  When the party betrayed him, he moved to the Libertarian Party, only came back to the Republican Party when the hostile takeover by one President Donald Trump.
[03:38:13.256 --> 03:38:15.558]  But thank you so much for that, Thomas.
[03:38:15.658 --> 03:38:16.859]  I know it's a big fear out there.
[03:38:17.139 --> 03:38:25.966]  I fear about it, and I'm nowhere near the public figure Alex is, because they absolutely will try to put moles in your operation to destroy it.
[03:38:26.006 --> 03:38:31.410]  And I think if there's been anybody, I'm not going to drop names, but his name was dropped on this episode.
[03:38:31.430 --> 03:38:36.154]  I think we know who the real bad agent would have been.
[03:38:36.394 --> 03:38:38.116]  He's currently obsessed with Q, I think.
[03:38:38.576 --> 03:38:40.678]  Let's go to Freddie in California.
[03:38:40.718 --> 03:38:43.040]  Freddie, thank you so much for calling into the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:43.161 --> 03:38:44.001]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[03:38:44.061 --> 03:38:45.223]  What do you have to say?
[03:38:45.243 --> 03:38:47.044]  Hey, Tom.
[03:38:47.084 --> 03:38:47.705]  What's up, man?
[03:38:47.745 --> 03:38:58.795]  Yeah, this whole thing with Roger Stone, it almost has the same effect to me personally as a Trump supporter, especially in California and Southern California.
[03:38:58.815 --> 03:38:59.896]  You know how they are out here.
[03:39:00.177 --> 03:39:01.538]  You're a brave man out there.
[03:39:02.679 --> 03:39:02.939]  Yeah.
[03:39:04.389 --> 03:39:06.930]  It almost has the same effect as Mike Flynn.
[03:39:06.990 --> 03:39:10.032]  When they got Mike Flynn, I was like, what the heck is going on?
[03:39:10.092 --> 03:39:12.053]  But two points I want to make.
[03:39:12.413 --> 03:39:19.897]  Sarah Huckabee Sanders' comment this morning, I think, was a slap to the face to Trump supporters, just my personal opinion.
[03:39:20.238 --> 03:39:33.665]  I mean, anytime we see a Trump supporter slapped, kicked, beaten, threatened, her response should be played as just throwing the entire 63-plus million Trump supporters under the bus.
[03:39:34.139 --> 03:39:35.001]  I didn't like it.
[03:39:35.021 --> 03:39:36.463]  I thought it was tacky.
[03:39:36.564 --> 03:39:40.310]  And if I was, uh... I would have fired her.
[03:39:40.370 --> 03:39:41.392]  But see, that's the point.
[03:39:41.833 --> 03:39:42.134]  I want...
[03:39:43.379 --> 03:39:44.360]  I want President Trump.
[03:39:44.640 --> 03:39:47.562]  I want to know... Your phone's kind of breaking up a little bit.
[03:39:47.622 --> 03:39:52.305]  I don't know if you might be in a wind tunnel or something like that, but I do know what you mean.
[03:39:52.525 --> 03:39:55.427]  I feel like and I think a lot of people do at this point.
[03:39:55.587 --> 03:39:57.629]  I am an emphatic supporter of President Trump.
[03:39:57.869 --> 03:39:59.430]  I think he's done amazing things.
[03:39:59.490 --> 03:40:02.832]  The Supreme Court alone is going to keep this country going for another 20-25 years.
[03:40:04.313 --> 03:40:09.158]  But it feels like sometimes we're out there giving our financial security away.
[03:40:09.298 --> 03:40:11.199]  We're giving away our physical security away.
[03:40:11.219 --> 03:40:12.280]  You mentioned California.
[03:40:12.320 --> 03:40:15.043]  We all know what goes on in Berkeley and elsewhere.
[03:40:15.383 --> 03:40:19.226]  If you wear a Trump hat in that state, you might as well be wearing a white hood.
[03:40:19.246 --> 03:40:25.092]  And I'm not just getting that idea out of nowhere, as we all know from the Covington fiasco last week, or this week even.
[03:40:26.010 --> 03:40:30.333]  But it does feel like sometimes we're all putting our necks on the lines.
[03:40:30.353 --> 03:40:32.014]  We want the administration to do so as well.
[03:40:32.034 --> 03:40:34.096]  And I think we need to remember what Trump gave up.
[03:40:34.296 --> 03:40:36.297]  He had a pretty sweet life.
[03:40:36.598 --> 03:40:38.339]  He's given up all of that.
[03:40:38.419 --> 03:40:39.980]  He's given up his family security.
[03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:45.264]  They're trying to drag his business, his children, his grandchildren's names through the mud.
[03:40:45.504 --> 03:40:47.185]  Look at all the hit pieces on Barron Trump.
[03:40:47.205 --> 03:40:53.010]  So perhaps maybe that's what I tell myself when I think we've given all this collectively as supporters.
[03:40:53.070 --> 03:40:54.851]  But I do know where you're coming from.
[03:40:55.111 --> 03:41:00.915]  I'm looking for the administration to do something that is real, that we can see, that is tangible.
[03:41:01.716 --> 03:41:06.499]  Come out and say, why on earth are you persecuting people that I've worked with for 40 years?
[03:41:06.559 --> 03:41:08.461]  This is obviously an attempt to get to me.
[03:41:08.541 --> 03:41:10.302]  That's what I want the president to say.
[03:41:10.562 --> 03:41:12.063]  And I hope he doesn't do it on Twitter.
[03:41:12.083 --> 03:41:13.424]  But what's your second point, Freddie?
[03:41:14.805 --> 03:41:20.129]  The second point is, I thought Trump coming out and getting the economy going.
[03:41:20.489 --> 03:41:23.091]  Look, we all survived under the Obama economy.
[03:41:23.493 --> 03:41:24.534]  So we're doing great.
[03:41:24.875 --> 03:41:34.666]  So my thought was, OK, Trump's going to come get the economy piping hot so that when he does pull the trigger on the deep state, it wouldn't be such a hard crash.
[03:41:35.146 --> 03:41:38.590]  But I'm just waiting for him to act on the deep state.
[03:41:38.910 --> 03:41:40.332]  I don't know what your thoughts about that.
[03:41:41.844 --> 03:41:58.810]  I definitely know where you're coming from, and we have seen now numerous times, whenever President Trump, maybe he starts to walk up to that line, we will see them hike up the interest rates at the Fed, and the stock market goes down, and everybody's talking about the second Great Recession, or even the second Great Depression.
[03:41:59.190 --> 03:42:03.152]  So they're absolutely plotting and planning with everything they've got in their arsenal.
[03:42:03.172 --> 03:42:05.013]  But Freddie, I definitely don't think you're alone here.
[03:42:05.053 --> 03:42:08.195]  There's a lot of people out there who are looking to see President Trump.
[03:42:08.215 --> 03:42:09.976]  You know, the first year, he admitted.
[03:42:10.036 --> 03:42:17.300]  Everybody knew he was going to focus on the economy, on doing the stuff that essentially any Republican president would have done.
[03:42:17.700 --> 03:42:19.621]  The second year, it came out.
[03:42:19.922 --> 03:42:22.223]  I think it was leaked through Bannon, allegedly, which, you know,
[03:42:22.763 --> 03:42:24.905]  He has his own swamp monsters around him.
[03:42:25.265 --> 03:42:30.590]  But it was leaked through Bannon that the second year President Trump intended to focus on trade.
[03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:31.491]  And boy did he.
[03:42:31.551 --> 03:42:32.492]  He did a great job.
[03:42:32.712 --> 03:42:36.515]  He's bullied China to the point where they're no longer going to have the Chinese millennium.
[03:42:36.815 --> 03:42:41.319]  They're escalating their totalitarianism in a desperate bid to keep control.
[03:42:41.659 --> 03:42:43.781]  North Korea has been brought to heel.
[03:42:44.081 --> 03:42:48.065]  All across the world we see NAFTA renegotiated, even though it has some flaws.
[03:42:48.425 --> 03:42:53.972]  We see all kinds of great things happening from President Trump's focus on trade last year.
[03:42:54.293 --> 03:43:02.002]  This year, or maybe next year, but I think that's too late, this year the focus needs to be on exposing and defeating these deep state...
[03:43:05.342 --> 03:43:08.023]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:43:08.363 --> 03:43:14.266]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:43:14.806 --> 03:43:30.253]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:43:30.273 --> 03:43:34.015]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!

[03:43:39.001 --> 03:43:41.942]  This is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[03:43:43.883 --> 03:43:46.504]  Perfect for work, in the car or at home.
[03:43:47.045 --> 03:43:49.826]  Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:43:50.286 --> 03:43:51.727]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:43:52.307 --> 03:43:55.149]  Perk up with Turbo Force at Infowarstore.com.
[03:44:08.917 --> 03:44:10.659]  Let's go to Wildman in Illinois.
[03:44:10.699 --> 03:44:13.021]  Thanks for holding and about to say Happy New Year.
[03:44:13.041 --> 03:44:13.321]  Go ahead.
[03:44:13.622 --> 03:44:23.132]  Alex, yeah, going into 2019, what Trump's got to do to save America, he's got to declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[03:44:23.172 --> 03:44:24.333]  That's how he saves America.
[03:44:24.393 --> 03:44:28.097]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hard-working, honest man, that's what I believe.
[03:44:28.357 --> 03:44:28.657]  I agree.
[03:44:28.757 --> 03:44:29.498]  Victory or death.
[03:44:29.558 --> 03:44:31.239]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[03:44:31.559 --> 03:44:33.061]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[03:44:33.601 --> 03:44:36.143]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[03:44:36.523 --> 03:44:38.825]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[03:44:38.845 --> 03:44:40.506]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[03:44:40.526 --> 03:44:41.126]  It's already begun.
[03:44:41.146 --> 03:44:43.228]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[03:44:43.728 --> 03:44:49.032]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[03:44:49.412 --> 03:44:50.033]  So just get ready.
[03:44:50.313 --> 03:44:50.793]  I'd say.
[03:44:50.853 --> 03:44:54.454]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[03:44:54.655 --> 03:44:57.115]  I'm a loyal supporter and thanks for great products.
[03:44:57.295 --> 03:44:58.336]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[03:44:58.396 --> 03:44:59.616]  I want to thank you.
[03:44:59.796 --> 03:45:07.039]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[03:45:07.779 --> 03:45:09.199]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[03:45:10.320 --> 03:45:11.380]  They're taking everybody.
[03:45:11.420 --> 03:45:13.200]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[03:45:13.240 --> 03:45:16.341]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[03:45:16.401 --> 03:45:18.281]  That's why this is a war.
[03:45:18.842 --> 03:45:20.322]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[03:45:20.582 --> 03:45:21.882]  Which products do you like the best?
[03:45:22.022 --> 03:45:23.603]  Man, I use the bodies.
[03:45:23.683 --> 03:45:24.903]  I got so many t-shirts.
[03:45:24.923 --> 03:45:26.003]  It ain't even funny.
[03:45:26.043 --> 03:45:30.664]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, my truck.
[03:45:31.105 --> 03:45:34.665]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[03:45:34.985 --> 03:45:36.126]  I spread the word about you.
[03:45:36.306 --> 03:45:37.106]  I wear your clothes.
[03:45:37.506 --> 03:45:39.408]  Your hats, your shirts, you name it.
[03:45:40.049 --> 03:45:41.190]  Multitude of products.
[03:45:41.510 --> 03:45:45.154]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[03:45:45.194 --> 03:45:52.081]  Um, you know, it's uh, people skeptical, but like, it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[03:45:52.141 --> 03:45:54.904]  I just, I guess so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[03:46:03.450 --> 03:46:06.733]  Now you've stayed vigilant, you've been pushing the site, and you've been helping us get it out there.
[03:46:06.833 --> 03:46:10.397]  But if you don't keep pushing, this is an ongoing fight we're going to lose.
[03:46:10.597 --> 03:46:14.781]  So please, InfoWars.com forward slash show, get that link out to everybody.
[03:46:14.881 --> 03:46:18.825]  And please remember InfoWarsStore.com, where we have the very best fish oil.
[03:46:19.005 --> 03:46:20.206]  We're good to go.
[03:46:45.325 --> 03:46:47.766]  TurboForce is the ultimate vitamin mineral.
[03:46:47.826 --> 03:46:50.087]  Total energy fusion next level.
[03:46:50.127 --> 03:46:51.587]  Total mega package.
[03:46:51.647 --> 03:46:52.848]  Nothing else is even near it.
[03:46:52.968 --> 03:46:58.729]  Get TurboForce today at InfoWarsLive.com, but I recommend you only take half a dose the first time.
[03:46:58.829 --> 03:47:00.730]  Beware the power of TurboForce!
[03:47:06.752 --> 03:47:09.373]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:15.629 --> 03:47:18.396]  Yeah, we're good.
[03:47:32.933 --> 03:47:35.534]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:35.574 --> 03:47:36.674]  This is the fourth hour.
[03:47:36.694 --> 03:47:41.115]  I am your guest host, Tom Paffert, and we are winding down the show here.
[03:47:41.175 --> 03:47:43.216]  Make sure to tune in to War Room.
[03:47:43.296 --> 03:47:52.218]  Coming up next, Roger Stone will be making another appearance live after he was released on Bond Today.
[03:47:52.238 --> 03:47:56.840]  $250,000 bond for the crime of being a member of the media, essentially.
[03:47:56.860 --> 03:47:58.040]  So we're going to keep taking your calls.
[03:47:58.060 --> 03:48:01.341]  We've got Jeff, we've got Jacob, we've got John, we've got more people to talk to, but
[03:48:02.285 --> 03:48:09.170]  As I'm sitting here thinking about this in the break, I realize more and more this is their perfect distraction.
[03:48:09.570 --> 03:48:13.512]  They had the worst week ever, and it just kept going.
[03:48:13.832 --> 03:48:18.655]  Nancy Pelosi, in the midst of a government shutdown, is taking a three-day weekend right now.
[03:48:18.996 --> 03:48:23.619]  Last, uh, just two days ago, I guess, she was speaking before the Conference of Mayors.
[03:48:23.899 --> 03:48:25.760]  She's stumbling over her words.
[03:48:26.020 --> 03:48:28.842]  She's doing her please clap, where she tells the audience,
[03:48:29.082 --> 03:48:30.003]  That's an applause line.
[03:48:30.043 --> 03:48:30.764]  Please clap now.
[03:48:30.804 --> 03:48:31.284]  Please clap.
[03:48:31.304 --> 03:48:32.105]  That's an applause line.
[03:48:32.365 --> 03:48:35.508]  She just looked awful in every single sense.
[03:48:35.909 --> 03:48:38.931]  How do we get this to stop being the news?
[03:48:38.991 --> 03:48:40.613]  How do we make BuzzFeed go away?
[03:48:40.653 --> 03:48:42.735]  How do we make the Covington teens go away?
[03:48:42.975 --> 03:48:53.005]  How do we make the absolutely horrendous leader known as Nancy Pelosi, the swamp creature who has lived for 30 plus years getting fat off the government,
[03:48:54.068 --> 03:48:55.589]  Mike, she makes, what, 40 grand a year?
[03:48:55.709 --> 03:48:56.790]  How is she getting so much money?
[03:48:56.830 --> 03:48:58.010]  How does she have multiple houses?
[03:48:58.050 --> 03:49:02.113]  How does Laura Loomer have to pick which house she goes to to chain herself to?
[03:49:02.533 --> 03:49:03.974]  It's very circumspect.
[03:49:03.994 --> 03:49:05.355]  So how do we make all that go away?
[03:49:05.575 --> 03:49:07.536]  Well, let's arrest Roger Stone.
[03:49:07.556 --> 03:49:12.619]  And if you read the CNN article, they specifically say that this indictment is not new.
[03:49:12.919 --> 03:49:17.522]  It was just unsealed on Friday, which goes to my hypothesis that this was planned.
[03:49:17.762 --> 03:49:20.884]  This was orchestrated, and Roger Stone is just the sacrificial
[03:49:21.244 --> 03:49:22.144]  Lamb to the slaughter.
[03:49:22.504 --> 03:49:25.285]  Jeff has something to say about Roger Stone as well.
[03:49:25.305 --> 03:49:26.405]  He's been holding for about an hour.
[03:49:26.465 --> 03:49:28.666]  Thank you for your patience, Jeff, from Vancouver.
[03:49:29.066 --> 03:49:30.306]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:49:30.366 --> 03:49:31.067]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[03:49:32.667 --> 03:49:33.047]  Hey, Tom.
[03:49:33.087 --> 03:49:33.547]  Thanks a lot.
[03:49:34.827 --> 03:49:43.370]  Just wanted to say Alex, spiritually, was right on earlier in the show, and I think his analysis of the first interview with Roger was spot on.
[03:49:43.390 --> 03:49:48.451]  I think the media will take any scrap and then just stitch it together and just spin a bunch of BS.
[03:49:49.284 --> 03:49:51.366]  The way they, you know, were set up to do.
[03:49:51.386 --> 03:49:57.031]  I think there's a real golden opportunity here, though, in any in any overreach.
[03:49:57.471 --> 03:50:01.895]  And this is tremendous overreach by the mainstream media and the political elite.
[03:50:02.836 --> 03:50:05.739]  There's an opportunity for a judo move, and I think this is it.
[03:50:06.439 --> 03:50:09.162]  Roger is an employee of Infowars.
[03:50:09.582 --> 03:50:15.167]  I think if he stays exclusively speaking his piece through Infowars,
[03:50:15.851 --> 03:50:15.991]  Right.
[03:50:38.853 --> 03:50:43.115]  Well, and if you look at it, Jeff, that's exactly what happened this morning.
[03:50:43.215 --> 03:50:56.101]  That is precisely what happened this morning, where Roger Stone, if the media was smart, they would have let him come out there, and they would have been quiet as a church mouse, and then CNN could have had him live, and MSNBC could have had him live.
[03:50:56.161 --> 03:51:12.765]  And all of these different organizations could have had him live, but instead, they forced Roger to go to the Alex Jones Show, top-linked on Drudge, and he got his word out there in a more powerful, more concise, and more, frankly, professional way than the media ever would have allowed him to.
[03:51:12.805 --> 03:51:14.226]  They didn't get to take a soundbite.
[03:51:14.246 --> 03:51:16.926]  And now if they do take a soundbite, this is the real beautiful part.
[03:51:16.946 --> 03:51:23.668]  Let's say when Roger Stone is on the war room, coming up here in about 12, uh, 10 minutes, when Roger Stone is on the war room,
[03:51:23.988 --> 03:51:25.991]  Let's say they want to take a soundbite out of that.
[03:51:26.011 --> 03:51:33.763]  Well, people can just go infowars.com slash show and watch the full episode and actually see it in context.
[03:51:33.783 --> 03:51:34.645]  I think you're absolutely right.
[03:51:34.925 --> 03:51:38.611]  This is a tremendous opportunity disguised as a tragedy.
[03:51:39.545 --> 03:51:46.807]  And it just matters that people support, which is why it's so important people go to InfoWarsStore.com, get a water filter, get an air filter.
[03:51:46.847 --> 03:51:49.988]  I also have a ProPure Breeze air filter in my apartment.
[03:51:50.228 --> 03:51:52.388]  I live in a 110-year-old building.
[03:51:52.728 --> 03:51:55.149]  I'm a little bit fearful of asbestos at times.
[03:51:55.189 --> 03:51:57.109]  They tell me that there's none here, but I do wonder.
[03:51:57.189 --> 03:52:03.631]  And I sleep better at night, literally, not figuratively, because of that ProPure Breeze air filter.
[03:52:03.991 --> 03:52:05.192]  We're running out of time here.
[03:52:05.212 --> 03:52:06.413]  We've got about 10 minutes left of the show.
[03:52:06.433 --> 03:52:14.819]  I want to remind everybody, Roger Stone will be coming up on War Room next, but let's go to Jacob in Ohio who wants to talk about FBI corruption.
[03:52:14.879 --> 03:52:17.921]  And believe me, this could be a great example of that.
[03:52:17.961 --> 03:52:19.062]  Welcome to the show, Jacob.
[03:52:19.442 --> 03:52:20.703]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:52:20.803 --> 03:52:21.643]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[03:52:22.604 --> 03:52:23.325]  Well, hello, Tom.
[03:52:24.465 --> 03:52:28.048]  We will see the downfall of Mueller as an example of God's justice.
[03:52:29.062 --> 03:52:35.326]  The raid on Roger Stone's home and these Gestapo and media circus tactics remind me of what happened to my friend Schaefer Cox.
[03:52:35.906 --> 03:52:40.229]  He just tried to defend his family, and now he's in a CIA-controlled prison with jihadis.
[03:52:41.410 --> 03:52:49.175]  The false statement charges that you see against Roger Stone, it's a favorite, a trumped-up charge for the DOJ.
[03:52:49.195 --> 03:52:52.977]  They used them against Ted Stevens to pass Obamacare.
[03:52:54.074 --> 03:52:59.418]  And that had a Polar Pen team link to the prosecution against Schaefer Cox in Alaska as well.
[03:53:00.659 --> 03:53:02.341]  See, I hope you're absolutely right.
[03:53:02.621 --> 03:53:04.843]  All the media, you know, CNN was camping out.
[03:53:04.883 --> 03:53:08.846]  They're now saying that their journalists are just brilliant mind readers.
[03:53:08.906 --> 03:53:10.107]  They're Nostradamus.
[03:53:10.427 --> 03:53:16.872]  And they've been able to preemptively see that today was the day that Roger Stone would be arrested.
[03:53:17.212 --> 03:53:20.155]  But there's obviously been some collusion between the Mueller camp.
[03:53:20.215 --> 03:53:21.756]  At least, it seems that way.
[03:53:21.856 --> 03:53:23.037]  Obviously, there's no proof.
[03:53:23.377 --> 03:53:27.098]  But apparently you can throw that accusation around without proof these days.
[03:53:27.459 --> 03:53:31.880]  But it sure seems like they were talking to each other and they were coordinating and they were celebrating.
[03:53:32.200 --> 03:53:36.682]  If you read the CNN article I was referencing earlier, to them it's an early birthday present.
[03:53:36.742 --> 03:53:39.723]  Christmas comes twice in 2019 for CNN.
[03:53:40.023 --> 03:53:44.065]  And I think regular, average, everyday Americans are going to see this.
[03:53:44.345 --> 03:53:48.807]  InfoWars viewers especially, because you guys are the most tuned in people in the world.
[03:53:48.827 --> 03:53:52.008]  You're going to see this and you're going to see CNN salivating.
[03:53:52.388 --> 03:53:55.430]  Over destroying a 66-year-old man's life.
[03:53:55.710 --> 03:54:01.113]  And they just celebrated, and they're so antsy, and they're excited, and they're smiling, and they're energetic again!
[03:54:01.353 --> 03:54:02.734]  We're finally gonna get Trump!
[03:54:02.894 --> 03:54:05.175]  And it disgusts normal people.
[03:54:05.356 --> 03:54:07.177]  It makes them disgusted.
[03:54:07.257 --> 03:54:09.658]  It causes a gut-level reaction.
[03:54:09.698 --> 03:54:11.339]  Like Alex Jones says, it's your spirits.
[03:54:12.219 --> 03:54:15.061]  Rejecting this evil, and that's what this is.
[03:54:15.261 --> 03:54:22.806]  The idea that we're going to destroy a 66-year-old man's life, a patriot since he was 12 years old, and his neighbor handed him a book about Barry Goldwater.
[03:54:23.447 --> 03:54:27.089]  This is disgusting, and normal people, I think, can see that.
[03:54:27.129 --> 03:54:28.230]  Well, thank you so much, Jacob.
[03:54:28.270 --> 03:54:30.772]  I want to keep taking calls because we only have a few minutes left.
[03:54:30.812 --> 03:54:34.294]  Let's go to John in Boston who wants to talk about Roger Stone as well.
[03:54:34.334 --> 03:54:35.995]  John, welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:36.095 --> 03:54:36.836]  I'm Tom Papert.
[03:54:37.850 --> 03:54:38.710]  Good afternoon, Tom.
[03:54:38.750 --> 03:54:39.751]  It's good to be with you.
[03:54:40.271 --> 03:54:49.514]  You know, first and foremost, I just wanted to express my disgust for the way that they went and got Roger Stone today as if he was El Chapo or, you know, Osama Bin Laden.
[03:54:49.594 --> 03:54:51.515]  It's just completely ridiculous.
[03:54:51.775 --> 03:54:54.296]  And, you know, the overreach is insane.
[03:54:54.696 --> 03:54:57.877]  But what the people who are carrying this don't realize
[03:54:58.644 --> 03:55:05.015]  Is giving anybody this much power to operate under these circumstances can be used against you as well.
[03:55:05.156 --> 03:55:10.525]  You know, Roger is just the first guy and he happens to be on the Trump side right now, but it can go either way.
[03:55:11.502 --> 03:55:19.985]  You know, part of me, the Machiavellian in me, and this is not necessarily the stance that the rational side of my brain takes, but part of me wishes that were true.
[03:55:20.446 --> 03:55:24.827]  That, hey, if the Democrats can do this, if Mueller can do this, then maybe Trump can.
[03:55:25.128 --> 03:55:33.671]  But one of the most horrifying things we've learned from the Trump administration is that the executive branch only has power if it's a globalist.
[03:55:34.031 --> 03:55:36.054]  Otherwise, it might as well be symbolic.
[03:55:36.074 --> 03:55:38.456]  Don't get me wrong, Trump has done some fantastic things.
[03:55:38.717 --> 03:55:39.197]  Taxes?
[03:55:39.398 --> 03:55:39.718]  Great.
[03:55:39.898 --> 03:55:40.659]  Supreme Court?
[03:55:40.999 --> 03:55:41.400]  Great.
[03:55:41.780 --> 03:55:44.664]  But Obama declared how many national emergencies?
[03:55:44.924 --> 03:55:46.025]  And Trump can't declare one.
[03:55:46.045 --> 03:55:50.611]  So I do, I, you know, that is, in an abstract sense, absolutely right.
[03:55:50.811 --> 03:55:53.875]  Once you create the ability for somebody to have this power,
[03:55:54.858 --> 03:55:56.299]  It can't really be contained.
[03:55:56.339 --> 03:56:19.331]  They've opened Pandora's box, but at the same time, I don't think it's going to be Trump who gets to exercise this power, and we better hope that there is nobody, you know, they say Trump is literally Hitler, they better hope no literal Hitler ever comes forward, because they have empowered the executive office for some lunatic, some madman, who actually wants to take this power, who wants to take the ring and not throw it into the volcano,
[03:56:19.691 --> 03:56:21.713]  They have given him unlimited power.
[03:56:21.813 --> 03:56:26.937]  And I make the case, I think Mueller is the strongest, most powerful man on the face of the earth right now.
[03:56:27.217 --> 03:56:34.743]  He has more power than Mao version 2 in China, than Kim Jong-il in North Korea, than George Soros.
[03:56:34.983 --> 03:56:40.248]  He, oh for some trumped up charges, can essentially sentence a man to life in prison.
[03:56:40.308 --> 03:56:41.749]  Roger Stone, and it's disgusting.
[03:56:41.789 --> 03:56:43.030]  John, thank you so much for your call.
[03:56:43.050 --> 03:56:48.034]  You make a great point about the ability for the power structure to be abused.
[03:56:48.698 --> 03:56:50.399]  Or perhaps used correctly.
[03:56:50.439 --> 03:56:55.761]  So in our final minute or so here, I do want to remind everybody one more time, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:56:55.861 --> 03:56:58.262]  Alex Jones, he is the tip of the spear.
[03:56:58.362 --> 03:57:00.283]  It is tomorrow's news today.
[03:57:00.623 --> 03:57:02.684]  He has broken more stories than anybody else.
[03:57:02.704 --> 03:57:05.865]  You know, in my little meme community on Facebook, God Emperor Trump.
[03:57:06.665 --> 03:57:07.186]  We joke.
[03:57:07.666 --> 03:57:13.391]  If you think Alex Jones is crazy, give it 18 months and he will be proven completely accurate.
[03:57:13.411 --> 03:57:20.157]  And if you want to see this type of journalism continue, if you want to see this type of breaking news continue, they're going to need money.
[03:57:20.197 --> 03:57:22.238]  They're going to need money to fight this with Roger Stone.
[03:57:22.579 --> 03:57:26.262]  Alex Jones is inevitably going to be the next target or one of the next targets.
[03:57:26.562 --> 03:57:29.244]  They're going to need financial resources to do that.
[03:57:29.304 --> 03:57:38.989]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com, go to StoneDefenseFund.com, and personally, ever since my supply of Supermail Vitality ran out, I'm a big fan of Alpha Power.
[03:57:39.169 --> 03:57:46.213]  I think that it works quite well as a, not necessarily a substitute, but an alternative to Supermail Vitality.
[03:57:46.253 --> 03:57:50.216]  So, this has been Tom Pappert guest hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:50.276 --> 03:57:52.397]  You can catch me on Facebook, weeknights, 8 p.m.
[03:57:56.730 --> 03:57:59.972]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[03:58:00.312 --> 03:58:05.195]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[03:58:05.395 --> 03:58:07.096]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[03:58:07.216 --> 03:58:10.918]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[03:58:11.058 --> 03:58:13.080]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[03:58:13.140 --> 03:58:24.226]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[03:58:24.526 --> 03:58:27.168]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[03:58:27.288 --> 03:58:28.388]  How about physical wealth?
[03:58:28.729 --> 03:58:30.730]  When I forget to pick my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[03:58:31.290 --> 03:58:32.351]  We have X2.
[03:58:32.431 --> 03:58:37.714]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it to 12,000 feet.
[03:58:38.134 --> 03:58:39.675]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[03:58:39.855 --> 03:58:45.859]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize.
[03:58:45.979 --> 03:58:47.420]  And this other form of iodine,
[03:58:47.580 --> 03:58:50.284]  And the other form, all three, so that it's better absorbable.
[03:58:50.364 --> 03:58:51.065]  That's X3.
[03:58:51.225 --> 03:58:52.507]  We have a limited supply of X2.
[03:58:52.728 --> 03:58:53.489]  It's our final run.
[03:58:53.749 --> 03:58:54.570]  But here are the headlines.
[03:58:55.111 --> 03:58:56.373]  That's Discovery Magazine.
