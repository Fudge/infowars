[00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:08.743]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:14.352]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:19.333]  President Trump, you must defend the First Amendment.
[00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:22.175]  You must stand up against Big Tech censorship.
[00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:26.538]  President Trump, you must stand up against Big Tech censorship.
[00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:28.619]  You must stand up for free speech.
[00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.020]  Now is the time.
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.022]  President Trump, you must release Julian Assange.
[00:00:34.402 --> 00:00:39.345]  Julian Assange didn't do anything wrong, but as a whistleblower, exposed criminal activity.
[00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:40.946]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:42.747]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:44.388]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:46.108]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:00:46.328 --> 00:00:47.709]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.329]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:52.930]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:02.592]  So there's Alex Jones in front of the White House yesterday while President Donald Trump is meeting with Jack Dorsey, the CEO, President, founder of Twitter.
[00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:25.814]  So we're gonna have more clips from Alex Jones yesterday bullhorning the White House, and we will most likely be hearing from Alex Jones before the end of the broadcast today as well.
[00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:33.317]  But, you know, here's the deal, because I've got this stack of news, all kinds of stuff to get to, something that
[00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:36.955]  Really angered me yesterday and I lost my temper on air.
[00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:39.895]  It seems that the president has now responded, so that's great news.
[00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:50.438]  The president is listening to us, but we are growing weary of the lack of action.
[00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:55.479]  So, will Twitter stop shadow banning conservatives?
[00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:56.679]  I doubt it.
[00:01:58.035 --> 00:02:03.800]  But will the President and Jack Dorsey hear that Alex Jones was outside and maybe even hurt him with the bullhorn?
[00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:05.281]  Absolutely.
[00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:06.322]  Man, you know, look.
[00:02:07.843 --> 00:02:13.408]  I'm not a big... I'm not the one to judge somebody's fashion, like, typically.
[00:02:13.528 --> 00:02:18.052]  I mean, I don't mind critiquing it or talking about it, but seriously, what is the deal with Jack Dorsey?
[00:02:18.132 --> 00:02:19.473]  Does this guy have no taste?
[00:02:21.355 --> 00:02:24.258]  Does this guy intentionally always want to look like a bum?
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.603]  He looks like he just got done panhandling on the side of the road!
[00:02:30.323 --> 00:02:31.264]  What is this guy's deal?
[00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.245]  He's in the White House!
[00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.085]  Come on, dude!
[00:02:33.525 --> 00:02:35.086]  Like, comb your hair or something!
[00:02:36.287 --> 00:02:37.268]  What an embarrassment!
[00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:52.038]  Oh, and then... The hilarity at CNN is just... I can't even... So I think we may actually be joined by Brian Stelter today.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.501]  So I think that that's going to happen.
[00:02:54.862 --> 00:03:13.744]  Leo Zegami will be joining me, and then Patrick Casey from the American Identity Movement, whose video we featured yesterday of the gentleman dressed up as clowns in a clown world going to the Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.999]  And of course they got kicked out.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.621]  You know, you're only allowed to be at Drag Queen Story Hour dressed like a clown if you're there to play with the kids.
[00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:26.763]  But you know, if you're there to live in a clown world, you have to go.
[00:03:26.943 --> 00:03:28.023]  Look at that guy!
[00:03:28.463 --> 00:03:32.604]  Hold on, go back to the guy in the green shirt who's kicking them out.
[00:03:32.704 --> 00:03:37.086]  And he like puffs his belly out at them.
[00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:38.206]  It's like really odd.
[00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:40.387]  And he's wearing sandals with socks too.
[00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:41.307]  Oh my gosh.
[00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:44.258]  Is he not wearing sandals with socks?
[00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:46.919]  I mean, am I wrong about this?
[00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:47.999]  Or are those sandals with socks?
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.660]  And what are those?
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.360]  Track pants?
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.420]  This is an interesting fellow here.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.281]  He may even have a whistle around his neck.
[00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:58.422]  Alright, so that's going to be happening too.
[00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:02.203]  But you know, before I do all that, I'm going to have to do four hours of broadcasting today.
[00:04:02.223 --> 00:04:05.263]  So I'm going to need my TurboForce from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:04:05.283 --> 00:04:07.704]  I already took my BrainForce and a couple of
[00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:11.246]  Crill oil pills to really get my brain blasted.
[00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:13.007]  But I'm going to need a little extra energy today.
[00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:18.011]  So I'm going to take my Turbo Force right here and I'm doing the hot water mix today.
[00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:23.755]  So we're going to be sipping on Turbo Force during the Alex Jones Show today.
[00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:29.899]  So if you're wondering how I got all this energy, just
[00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:40.108]  Saunter on over to InfoWarsStore.com and get yourself a box or ten of Turbo Force from InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:04:40.168 --> 00:04:41.609]  Alright, so I'm about to go into full Chi mode.
[00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:42.730]  You know about this.
[00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:44.291]  It's a living meme.
[00:04:44.832 --> 00:04:45.452]  Just accept it.
[00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:57.922]  Just accept that Turbo Force has now become a living meme and just go to InfoWarsStore.com and get your Turbo Force and be memorized as we go to break here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.563]  BrainForce Plus is a top-tier nootropin.
[00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:08.764]  Focus.
[00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:10.045]  Clarity.
[00:05:10.486 --> 00:05:10.766]  Energy.
[00:05:11.426 --> 00:05:13.568]  But instead of having a 7x markup, we have a 150% markup.
[00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:19.076]  Right now, it's massively discounted.

[00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:30.201]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.

[00:06:17.232 --> 00:06:21.856]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:06:22.496 --> 00:06:26.019]  President Trump, you must defend the First Amendment.
[00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:28.601]  You must stand up against Big Tech censorship.
[00:06:29.082 --> 00:06:32.965]  President Trump, you must stand up against Big Tech censorship.
[00:06:33.305 --> 00:06:35.006]  You must stand up for free speech.
[00:06:35.347 --> 00:06:36.427]  Now is the time.
[00:06:37.008 --> 00:06:40.371]  President Trump, you must release Julian Assange.
[00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:45.715]  Julian Assange didn't do anything wrong, but as a whistleblower, exposed criminal activity.
[00:06:46.115 --> 00:06:47.336]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:06:47.777 --> 00:06:49.158]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:50.819]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.480]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:06:52.741 --> 00:06:54.082]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:06:54.402 --> 00:06:55.703]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:06:55.963 --> 00:06:57.104]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:06:57.444 --> 00:07:05.071]  That was the scene outside the White House yesterday, when Alex Jones was visiting D.C.
[00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:09.714]  on a secret mission from an alternate dimension.
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.545]  While President Trump was talking to Jack Dorsey inside the White House.
[00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:19.850]  We're still trying to find a comb for Mr. Dorsey.
[00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:28.179]  So we're going to have the full highlight video from yesterday of Alex Jones in Washington D.C.
[00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:30.982]  bullhunting the White House, walking around, meeting people.
[00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:38.684]  And doing his usual thing, which you will only find at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:39.284 --> 00:07:47.728]  But there is the President meeting with Jack Dorsey right there, and it looks like he's got a team of lawyers with him, perhaps.
[00:07:49.609 --> 00:07:51.270]  And the President has all their attention.
[00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:56.292]  Kit Daniels has the story at InfoWars.com.
[00:07:56.312 --> 00:08:00.954]  Trump holds closed-door meeting with Twitter's Jack Dorsey, and of course,
[00:08:02.776 --> 00:08:13.741]  Trump tweeted this out but you go back last year and you know what Trump has said during his rallies and this is what he tweeted out last July.
[00:08:14.381 --> 00:08:17.122]  Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans.
[00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:17.943]  Not good.
[00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:21.684]  We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.
[00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:23.945]  Many complaints.
[00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:27.327]  So.
[00:08:28.288 --> 00:08:47.742]  You wonder if the President brought that up, but you can see in the picture that he shared on Twitter that we have at Infowars.com, he has a stack of news on his desk that he appears to be going over with Mr. No-Come Jack Dorsey.
[00:08:50.104 --> 00:08:52.826]  And so, Alex Jones
[00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.591]  Was in D.C.
[00:08:55.691 --> 00:09:03.036]  while this was all going on, bullhorning outside the White House, doing his normal thing that you only get here at InfoWars.
[00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:19.788]  You know, what other... I mean, there is no other news organization where the face of the organization is actually the ones running everything and out in the front lines.
[00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:21.970]  You just don't get this anywhere else.
[00:09:24.795 --> 00:09:31.381]  And so we're going to have the full highlight video of that coming up on the other side.
[00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:33.863]  And then there's all kinds of other news.
[00:09:34.684 --> 00:09:47.996]  It seems that the president is just as upset as we are about what happened at the southern border where Mexican soldiers disarmed American soldiers and now the president is saying
[00:09:49.215 --> 00:09:51.316]  He believes it was a distraction.
[00:09:52.377 --> 00:09:59.081]  He believes it was a distraction for the drug smuggling that's going on, which I think I said that yesterday.
[00:09:59.421 --> 00:09:59.861]  I'm not sure.
[00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:02.182]  I'd have to go back and listen, but we talked about this yesterday.
[00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:03.463]  I lost my temper.
[00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:17.231]  And so we're going to be talking about that and some other news coming from the border, including a video we have of, this is just breaking right now, a bunch of armed men escorting
[00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.755]  A caravan across the southern border.
[00:10:24.237 --> 00:10:29.824]  So you know, you've got videos of kids being drugged through barbed wire fence.
[00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:31.847]  You've got videos of
[00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.290]  Kids at the top of fences.
[00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:39.992]  You've got videos of just armed men with rucksacks coming across.
[00:10:40.812 --> 00:10:43.832]  You've got drug smuggling coming across on video.
[00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:45.253]  Coyotes coming.
[00:10:45.313 --> 00:10:46.093]  It's all on video.
[00:10:46.113 --> 00:10:46.713]  Here's another one.
[00:10:46.853 --> 00:10:48.033]  Armed men escorting people.
[00:10:48.053 --> 00:10:49.954]  I mean, we're rolling this B-roll right now.
[00:10:50.074 --> 00:10:51.034]  It's incredible.
[00:10:51.274 --> 00:10:53.275]  So this is, you know, it's all going on at the southern border.
[00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:53.795]  But yeah, hey.
[00:10:53.815 --> 00:10:55.755]  It's liberal.
[00:10:57.696 --> 00:10:58.276]  It's progressive.
[00:11:01.786 --> 00:11:02.886]  No, you really have to wonder.
[00:11:03.686 --> 00:11:08.667]  You really have to wonder why our leaders are not doing anything about this.
[00:11:10.388 --> 00:11:11.908]  You've really got to wonder.
[00:11:13.788 --> 00:11:20.009]  Any sane person would accept the fact there is an emergency at the southern border.
[00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.831]  So you just ask yourself, what is driving these people insane?
[00:11:28.991 --> 00:11:29.431]  What is it?
[00:11:31.052 --> 00:11:38.074]  I mean, what do you have to see at the southern border to accept the reality?
[00:11:40.974 --> 00:11:56.078]  Again, kids being drugged through muddy water, drug across barbed wire, on top of large walls, tens of thousands of people breaking through fences, breaking through police lines, throwing weapons.
[00:11:57.526 --> 00:12:01.769]  Undercover video of, uh, them talking about how they're getting paid.
[00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.974]  People coming across with bags of drugs and guns.
[00:12:10.535 --> 00:12:15.578]  And you say, Hey, we need to do something at the southern border.
[00:12:15.658 --> 00:12:17.259]  You know, there's an emergency.
[00:12:17.479 --> 00:12:18.260]  It's kind of out of control.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.461]  How dare you, racist!
[00:12:20.481 --> 00:12:22.643]  It's just like, what?
[00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:26.025]  And then,
[00:12:27.638 --> 00:12:29.000]  Oh, who saw this coming?
[00:12:29.721 --> 00:12:31.624]  Info Wars is tomorrow's news today.
[00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:34.609]  So what's the new narrative around Russian collusion?
[00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:35.771]  What is the new narrative?
[00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:37.153]  What is the big headline?
[00:12:37.193 --> 00:12:38.334]  What is everybody talking about?
[00:12:41.238 --> 00:12:42.319]  Don McGahn.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:43.721]  So just get ready.
[00:12:43.981 --> 00:12:47.445]  Don McGahn will be on all the bottom lines for the next two days.
[00:12:47.686 --> 00:12:48.446]  Don McGahn.
[00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:50.168]  Don McGahn subpoenaed.
[00:12:50.449 --> 00:12:52.011]  Did Trump lie to Don McGahn?
[00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:53.993]  Was Don McGahn covering up for Trump?
[00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:55.715]  Who's Trump covering up for?
[00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:57.177]  Who is Don McGahn?
[00:12:57.617 --> 00:12:58.839]  Where is Don McGahn?
[00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:00.320]  I mean, so this is all coming.
[00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:03.943]  Don McGahn now obstructing justice with President Trump.
[00:13:04.163 --> 00:13:06.084]  Don McGahn now carrying Trump's water.
[00:13:06.924 --> 00:13:08.505]  It's all happening now.
[00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:10.366]  Don McGahn is the president.
[00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:11.867]  It's not even Trump.
[00:13:12.327 --> 00:13:13.248]  It's Don McGahn.
[00:13:13.628 --> 00:13:15.749]  Just like it was... Who else was there?
[00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:21.332]  I mean, should we go down the list of all the people that they've acted like this was the one, this was the be-all, the end-all, we finally got Trump?
[00:13:21.753 --> 00:13:23.194]  It's Don McGahn now.
[00:13:26.635 --> 00:13:29.037]  So the crew is just rolling through all the stories.
[00:13:30.464 --> 00:13:31.625]  It's the same old story.
[00:13:32.706 --> 00:13:43.217]  The criminal Democrats are engaged in a coup against the President, committing open treason.
[00:13:45.479 --> 00:13:46.661]  You can ask yourself why.
[00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:49.664]  But that's the same story.
[00:13:49.684 --> 00:13:51.606]  But it's now Don McGahn.
[00:13:53.775 --> 00:13:55.877]  So we're gonna have all of that and more.
[00:13:55.917 --> 00:13:59.080]  I got a bunch of culture news, a stack of that as well.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.982]  And let's not forget Leo Zagami is joining me at 11.30.
[00:14:02.343 --> 00:14:13.312]  And then Patrick Casey from the American Identity Movement, whose video we featured yesterday, protesting the Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:14:13.773 --> 00:14:16.816]  He will be joining me at 1.06 Central in the third hour.
[00:14:21.747 --> 00:14:26.491]  So, before we go to this break, let me give you the good news.
[00:14:28.293 --> 00:14:35.199]  We still have 50% off all InfoWars apparel at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.402]  This special has yet to be shut down.

[00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:18.135]  And it's funny, I was talking to somebody earlier about 2020 coming up.
[00:15:19.076 --> 00:15:34.920]  What's going to happen in 2020 when people are rushing to InfoWars and looking for Alex Jones and everything on social media and YouTube because that's, we were basically, I mean, number one on the internet for political and presidential campaign coverage for 2016.
[00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.760]  What are they going to do when they see we're banned?
[00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:40.041]  What are they going to do?
[00:15:41.869 --> 00:15:46.492]  It's going to be an interesting next couple of years, isn't it?
[00:15:46.972 --> 00:15:49.433]  Yes, it's only going to get stranger.
[00:15:51.755 --> 00:15:55.097]  So when we come back, we'll have the highlight reel of Alex Jones bullhorning the White House.
[00:15:55.297 --> 00:16:02.121]  But in this short four-minute break, go to InfoWarsStore.com and take advantage of 50% off all InfoWars apparel.

[00:16:15.925 --> 00:16:18.106]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:16:18.626 --> 00:16:19.587]  You're our only sponsors.

[00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:30.674]  You are the leader.
[00:16:30.874 --> 00:16:32.476]  When you take action, nothing stops you.

[00:19:02.714 --> 00:19:17.783]  Controlling the Human Mind, one of the most important books that I've ever written, deals with the whole concept of mind effects, mind control, going back to the historical perspective as well, as sort of the ways in which we might be able to enhance our performance.
[00:19:18.344 --> 00:19:21.666]  One of my classics, all of my books and videos are available.
[00:19:21.946 --> 00:19:22.887]  We're good to go.
[00:19:42.879 --> 00:19:44.219]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:25.249 --> 00:20:41.313]  Looking live there at the White House lawn, Alex Jones, the controversial host, Trump supporter, out there with a bullhorn, and that's what you heard earlier, some people out there as well, saying they support President Trump, but they don't support Twitter.
[00:20:41.353 --> 00:20:45.554]  President Trump meeting with the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, here at the White House today.
[00:20:45.574 --> 00:20:50.175]  You kind of hear the bullhorn in the background, thought we'd show you what is happening.
[00:20:56.839 --> 00:21:02.283]  That was Brett Baier on Fox News yesterday while the president was meeting with Jack Dorsey.
[00:21:03.584 --> 00:21:10.550]  He gives a shout out to Alex Jones, the controversial Alex Jones.
[00:21:11.671 --> 00:21:13.552]  Yes, make sure you add that caveat.
[00:21:15.034 --> 00:21:15.714]  But there you go.
[00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:21.579]  Hey, I actually give Brett credit to even say Voldemort's name on live television.
[00:21:22.319 --> 00:21:22.780]  So, uh,
[00:21:23.976 --> 00:21:24.956]  It's the small victories.
[00:21:25.036 --> 00:21:27.798]  But yes, you know, D.C.
[00:21:28.118 --> 00:21:30.659]  is buzzing right now, folks.
[00:21:31.239 --> 00:21:32.920]  And Alex Jones is still out there.
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.321]  And so I've got another story happening in D.C.
[00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:39.622]  right now that you're just not going to believe.
[00:21:39.822 --> 00:21:43.504]  In fact, I hope Alex runs into these people, quite frankly.
[00:21:45.264 --> 00:21:46.565]  And it would really be something.
[00:21:46.645 --> 00:21:48.666]  But before we get into what Alex
[00:21:49.795 --> 00:21:51.521]  Maybe doing today.
[00:21:52.264 --> 00:21:55.857]  Here is a look at what Alex Jones is doing yesterday.
[00:22:12.708 --> 00:22:16.810]  It's Alex Jones, in D.C., shaking hands, carrying a bullpen.
[00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:23.473]  President Trump's done a great job rebooting this country, but he hasn't stood up against Big Tech and the censorship!
[00:22:24.233 --> 00:22:36.779]  Big Tech has been caught in undercover videos of their own documents and whistleblowers, suppressing the speech of Christians and conservatives and veterans, and the left is planning on using this to steal the next election!
[00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:41.980]  President Trump must take action against Big Tech, rocketeering right now!
[00:22:42.401 --> 00:22:51.823]  President Trump must enforce the First Amendment and Section 230 of the Telecommunications Act and stop Big Tech from being censored!
[00:22:52.463 --> 00:22:57.345]  The American people demand that their First Amendment be defended!
[00:22:58.085 --> 00:23:04.551]  President Trump has signed an executive order to stop colleges from banning free speech!
[00:23:05.071 --> 00:23:06.973]  That is the right move by the President!
[00:23:07.474 --> 00:23:12.578]  But the President must take action against big tech censorship now!
[00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:17.062]  All the evidence shows the Democrats already stole the last midterm election.
[00:23:18.043 --> 00:23:22.387]  They are openly bragging about the censorship that they are engaged in.
[00:23:23.367 --> 00:23:28.271]  And we the people must stand against this censorship.
[00:23:28.732 --> 00:23:32.695]  President Trump, you must defend free speech.
[00:23:33.235 --> 00:23:43.343]  President Trump, you must take action for the First Amendment, for racketeering of the Democrats and big tech are colluding together.
[00:23:44.444 --> 00:24:04.350]  And because the federal government has left a large vacuum open with no regulation against these censors, it is allowing the communist Chinese, it is allowing the authoritarian EU, and it's allowing the Hollywood leftist to by fiat create a world government censorship system.
[00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:12.953]  President Trump, your only area you're failing right now is because Congress won't let you defend the border and wouldn't give you the funding.
[00:24:12.993 --> 00:24:13.693]  We understand.
[00:24:14.517 --> 00:24:20.041]  But the place you can't take action is as a champion of the First Amendment!
[00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:28.948]  President Trump, you are allowing the EU and the Communist Chinese and Big Tech to work together to censor!
[00:24:29.588 --> 00:24:34.392]  The argument that the government can't regulate these companies is bogus!
[00:24:34.732 --> 00:24:38.795]  Don't let the American people that elected you be silenced!
[00:24:39.296 --> 00:24:42.098]  Stand for the First Amendment!
[00:24:42.738 --> 00:24:44.459]  You know about the censorship!
[00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:46.019]  You know what's happened!
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.960]  Stand against the fake news!
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:25:00.265]  It is critical for you, President Trump, to take action against the globalists and the chi-cops working with traitors in our country to censor the American people!
[00:25:01.758 --> 00:25:05.080]  President Trump, you must take action against the censors!
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.121]  You must take action against Big Tech!
[00:25:08.401 --> 00:25:11.603]  You must take action against the globalists!
[00:25:11.943 --> 00:25:15.525]  You must take action against the NWO!
[00:25:16.025 --> 00:25:19.007]  We have the internal documents and videos of Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
[00:25:20.294 --> 00:25:24.139]  Admitted their incredible censorship of the American people.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.904]  We have the evidence of their collusion.
[00:25:28.445 --> 00:25:32.911]  We have the head of Google saying we're doing this to stop Trump winning again.
[00:25:32.931 --> 00:25:36.316]  And then they lie to Congress, President Trump.
[00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:41.736]  They lauded Congress, President Trump, and they say they'd never censor anybody!
[00:25:42.056 --> 00:25:43.617]  They'd never censor the conservative!
[00:25:43.918 --> 00:25:45.799]  They'd never fix the search for a result!
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.141]  Big Tech is lying!
[00:25:49.542 --> 00:25:58.688]  InfoWars.com has been standing for the Republic, so has NewsWars.com, and we have honorably been fighting for this Republic in its reboot.
[00:25:59.368 --> 00:26:05.350]  And the independent press that got you elected needs the cavalry to come, President Trump.
[00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.710]  Big Cat must be broken up!
[00:26:08.391 --> 00:26:10.411]  Big Cat is working with Communist China!
[00:26:10.971 --> 00:26:12.011]  It's working with the EU!
[00:26:12.031 --> 00:26:16.833]  It's working with others to openly censor not just their people, but us!
[00:26:18.273 --> 00:26:21.294]  This is the foreign election meddling, President Trump!
[00:26:22.034 --> 00:26:23.495]  This is globalism!
[00:26:23.735 --> 00:26:25.495]  But America's fighting back!
[00:26:26.555 --> 00:26:28.476]  And thanks to your leadership, we're away!
[00:26:29.324 --> 00:26:32.927]  But we need you to stand against big tech censorship, President Trump!
[00:26:33.327 --> 00:26:35.809]  President Trump, America, listen to you!
[00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:36.990]  We stood up!
[00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:38.471]  We got you elected!
[00:26:39.032 --> 00:26:46.257]  You defeated the fake Russiagate hoax, but now you must defeat the attempt to destroy the First Amendment!
[00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:50.461]  President Trump, please save the First Amendment!
[00:26:51.201 --> 00:26:54.523]  Please do the right thing and stand up against Big Tech!
[00:26:54.563 --> 00:27:07.030]  You will not win the 2020 election unless you stop the censorship because they'll steal the election, as they already plan to do, and you won't have the people's voice there when the whole corporate media turns against you.
[00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:13.413]  The Fox News is already starting to turn against you.
[00:27:13.493 --> 00:27:15.915]  Now is the time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:16.595 --> 00:27:19.717]  Now is the time to stand for the First Amendment.
[00:27:20.752 --> 00:27:28.156]  Now is the time to stand up against the Chai Comps and the EU working with big tech to restrict free speech.
[00:27:28.716 --> 00:27:32.799]  Now is the time to stand against these censors and take action.
[00:27:33.099 --> 00:27:34.640]  This is the right thing to do.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.901]  It's the right thing for the country.
[00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:39.142]  It's the right thing for America.
[00:27:40.783 --> 00:27:42.984]  And the censorship is incredible.
[00:27:43.865 --> 00:27:45.906]  And the censorship is un-American.
[00:27:46.766 --> 00:27:49.108]  And the censorship is illegal.
[00:27:49.981 --> 00:27:51.362]  President Trump!
[00:27:51.782 --> 00:27:54.444]  Stand up for the First Amendment!
[00:27:54.904 --> 00:27:56.225]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:27:56.665 --> 00:27:57.886]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:27:58.367 --> 00:27:59.567]  Free Julian Assange!
[00:28:00.128 --> 00:28:01.869]  Infowars.com!
[00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:03.490]  Infowars.com!
[00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.371]  Tomorrow's news today!
[00:28:06.012 --> 00:28:06.852]  Newswars.com!
[00:28:06.892 --> 00:28:10.174]  That's where you come to find the unfiltered truth.
[00:28:10.695 --> 00:28:11.895]  It's the threat of the globalists.
[00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:13.156]  It's the threat of the censors.
[00:28:13.457 --> 00:28:14.797]  It's the glut of their system.
[00:28:15.198 --> 00:28:16.158]  Infowars.com!
[00:28:16.258 --> 00:28:17.139]  Infowars.com!
[00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:30.336]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones bullhorning outside of the White House.
[00:28:31.237 --> 00:28:35.684]  Now, I've got a bullhorn right here.
[00:28:38.649 --> 00:28:40.631]  This bullhorn is legendary.
[00:28:41.431 --> 00:28:47.296]  And I'm actually sending this bullhorn out today to an Info Warrior.
[00:28:48.257 --> 00:28:48.978]  And who knows?
[00:28:49.418 --> 00:28:55.363]  If you play your cards right, you may get the Info Wars legendary bullhorn next.
[00:28:56.624 --> 00:28:57.725]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:57.865 --> 00:28:58.506]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:04.291]  I've got a big announcement to make.
[00:29:04.611 --> 00:29:06.673]  We've got four or five positions.
[00:29:10.948 --> 00:29:11.488]  We're good to go.
[00:29:30.333 --> 00:29:32.615]  There's a lot of new secret projects going on.
[00:29:32.795 --> 00:29:41.180]  The point is, if you want to build freedom in this country, and promote free speech, and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.943]  Send your resumes to techjobs at InfoWars.com today.
[00:29:44.963 --> 00:29:50.326]  I look forward to meeting some of you, and shaking your hand, and having you jump on the Millennium Falcon, the start of Episode 4.
[00:29:50.366 --> 00:29:52.027]  Because that's what you're going to be doing.
[00:29:52.067 --> 00:29:53.789]  This is the real ticket to adventure.
[00:30:03.694 --> 00:30:10.437]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:30:11.057 --> 00:30:13.618]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:30:14.158 --> 00:30:17.919]  And I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:30:18.439 --> 00:30:19.440]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:25.962]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:30:26.402 --> 00:30:28.263]  So remember, you are the Infowar.
[00:30:28.903 --> 00:30:29.604]  I'm not the leader.
[00:30:29.904 --> 00:30:30.505]  You are the leader.
[00:30:30.705 --> 00:30:32.287]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:30:32.687 --> 00:30:37.432]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:30:38.093 --> 00:30:45.580]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:46.882]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[00:30:47.242 --> 00:30:48.143]  I want to encourage you again.
[00:30:48.643 --> 00:30:53.328]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[00:30:53.568 --> 00:30:56.350]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[00:30:56.711 --> 00:30:58.632]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:30:58.833 --> 00:30:59.273]  God bless you.
[00:31:13.988 --> 00:31:23.576]  When I drink TurboForce, I usually like to drink it before the war room, and I get a kick, and then it sustains me through the rest of the night, and I get to work out it and everything.
[00:31:24.156 --> 00:31:27.659]  And I usually just pound it down and chase it with some BrainForce+.
[00:31:27.699 --> 00:31:36.506]  But Will Johnson, who's hosting the fourth hour, has made a suggestion before to me, and that is to drink it with hot water like you would sip on tea.
[00:31:36.826 --> 00:31:39.849]  So that's actually what I'm going to do today.
[00:31:40.689 --> 00:31:41.590]  On the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:49.095]  So let me just empty my packet of TurboForce into my InfoWars tumbler, which you can also get at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:49.135 --> 00:31:51.036]  Go ahead and knock that out.
[00:31:51.096 --> 00:31:51.937]  Go ahead and stir that in.
[00:31:51.977 --> 00:31:53.538]  I've got pretty hot water here.
[00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:57.641]  It's been sitting for a minute, so I should be able to drink this without it having to wait too long.
[00:31:57.881 --> 00:31:59.282]  I kind of feel like I'm doing an infomercial.
[00:31:59.422 --> 00:32:03.225]  Me stirring a cup of turbo force has never looked so good.
[00:32:03.546 --> 00:32:09.190]  Oh my gosh, we're about to sell out of turbo force with this one, folks, so you better go to Infowarsstore.com immediately, alright?
[00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:09.851]  You think I got it?
[00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:12.373]  Look at the turbo force spinning so eloquently.
[00:32:12.573 --> 00:32:16.456]  Nothing to disturb it, just pure energy waiting for me to consume it.
[00:32:16.656 --> 00:32:22.461]  Yes, ah, I'm thinking of my turbo force and how great it's going to make me feel.
[00:32:25.572 --> 00:32:29.414]  What am I going to get from my TurboForce at Infowarsstore.com?
[00:32:30.374 --> 00:32:30.795]  Yes.
[00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:33.136]  Total equilibrium.
[00:32:33.356 --> 00:32:34.016]  Wow.
[00:32:34.757 --> 00:32:36.017]  Find your chi.
[00:32:36.217 --> 00:32:40.239]  Find the energy with TurboForce at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.442]  I'm getting ready for a long four-hour broadcast and I need my energy.
[00:32:45.522 --> 00:32:54.066]  I'm sipping TurboForce mixed with hot water and I find my chi as I host the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:54.106 --> 00:32:54.687]  It's magic.
[00:32:55.797 --> 00:32:56.698]  It's Turbo Force.
[00:32:57.599 --> 00:32:58.901]  From Infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.574]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.497 --> 00:33:26.241]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[00:33:26.301 --> 00:33:29.423]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.743 --> 00:33:32.745]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:33.606 --> 00:33:41.152]  Well, I'm about to be joined by one of the most legendary Jedis in all of the galaxy.
[00:33:42.446 --> 00:33:47.029]  Leo Zagami from leozagami.com is about to be joining me.
[00:33:47.049 --> 00:33:55.476]  We sell his books at infowars.com and I brought Leo on today to really get the audience woke.
[00:33:56.918 --> 00:34:07.262]  And there's so much in the news today, I was wondering how I was even going to segue into this conversation I want to have with Leo today, but it turns out he's written the perfect story to do just that.
[00:34:07.982 --> 00:34:09.462]  It's at leozegami.com.
[00:34:09.642 --> 00:34:12.683]  Joe Biden, the Vatican candidate choice for 2020.
[00:34:13.144 --> 00:34:15.784]  Now there's some interesting things in this story.
[00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:19.586]  One is this Cura Foundation.
[00:34:20.846 --> 00:34:29.473]  And how it's linked to the Vatican and then kind of the dystopian biotech tyranny that it seems to be aligned with.
[00:34:30.694 --> 00:34:37.459]  But then too, I realized something going over this story before Leo joined us.
[00:34:39.113 --> 00:34:51.102]  Leo, it does appear to me that Joe Biden is the globalist candidate, and should we even dare say the secret society's the Illuminati candidate.
[00:34:52.123 --> 00:35:01.791]  And I realize this now, they're in big trouble because even though he's polling high right now, I'm not sure how realistic those polls are.
[00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:07.222]  And they're going to have a tough time getting Joe Biden into the White House.
[00:35:07.282 --> 00:35:08.123]  He's very old.
[00:35:08.644 --> 00:35:11.226]  Trump is having a lot of success right now.
[00:35:12.208 --> 00:35:16.512]  And I mean, let's not forget all the Biden groping videos that just went viral.
[00:35:16.532 --> 00:35:17.973]  I mean, those aren't going to go to rest.
[00:35:18.074 --> 00:35:22.758]  So it appears to me, Leo, correct me if I'm wrong, Biden, as you
[00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:36.247]  Yeah, it is definitely losing some points, this New World Order, with this candidate who is not very credible, at least to our eyes, our conservative eyes.
[00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:40.889]  But I'm sure that he has a very large audience, Owen, of libtards all over the world ready to endorse him.
[00:35:52.596 --> 00:36:03.078]  And, of course, I pointed out just with this photo that I put in this article, he's next to Lady Gaga, for example, who is a known Luciferian.
[00:36:03.799 --> 00:36:14.441]  During the documentary on Lady Gaga by Netflix, they actually played the music Lucifer Rising by Bobby Bessolel, which is one of the assassins of the Charles Manson massacres.
[00:36:14.941 --> 00:36:31.334]  And we're talking here about a candidate who is definitely endorsed because one year ago, exactly one year ago, there was this gathering in the Vatican called Unite to Cure, how science, technology, and the 21st century will impact culture and society.
[00:36:31.775 --> 00:36:36.799]  Now, everybody that is anybody in the Liptard movement was there.
[00:36:37.339 --> 00:36:55.575]  And there were, of course, Dr. Sanya Gupta from CNN, and then we had Deepak Chopra, we had Jack Nicolaous, we had Katy Perry, we had many people... Oh wait, Katy Perry, the one that was trying to steal that house in California from the nuns?
[00:36:55.895 --> 00:36:57.937]  The one that was petitioning the Pope?
[00:36:59.557 --> 00:37:02.999]  Well, of course, you have to be a Satanist or an Illuminati.
[00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:10.943]  Peter Gabriel, for example, was there, and we know that in the 80s, he already pioneered the symbolism of the Illuminati in one of his videos.
[00:37:11.344 --> 00:37:17.287]  So we are talking here about people that are at the core of the New World Order, including David Lynch.
[00:37:17.727 --> 00:37:25.772]  So these people met one year ago in the Vatican, and they said, in one year from now, we're going to announce this candidacy to the world.
[00:37:26.312 --> 00:37:35.365]  And I tell you, I mean, we might underestimate it, but I say let's be careful about this candidate because he could reserve some surprises.
[00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:36.627]  He's very powerful.
[00:37:37.027 --> 00:37:39.651]  And of course, they can play some dirty tricks.
[00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:42.094]  And 2020 is around the corner.
[00:37:42.114 --> 00:37:43.096]  So let's see what happens.
[00:37:43.636 --> 00:37:54.267]  The candidacy of Joe Biden will be announced in the next 24 to 48 hours, so exactly one year after this Vatican meeting where he spoke.
[00:37:54.367 --> 00:37:56.049]  So do you think this is a coincidence?
[00:37:56.069 --> 00:38:04.817]  I don't believe in coincidences in this setup, because these are people who know exactly what they're going to be doing in two years from now.
[00:38:05.018 --> 00:38:07.340]  They're not people like me and you all, and they have
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:15.183]  An agenda, schedule, everything is really calculated to the detail so they knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:35.292]  That's why I pointed out that he is the candidate of choice for the Vatican and of course the Jesuits are the ones who at the moment on both sides of the ocean are trying to push for this open borders immigrant policy and they are on one side here in Europe with Jean-Claude Ullrich
[00:38:35.772 --> 00:38:42.498]  Which is another Jean-Claude, and he's actually friend and fellow Luxembourgish Jean-Claude Juncker.
[00:38:42.518 --> 00:38:53.286]  So these two people, Jean-Claude Hurek is the head Jesuit who controls, is the president of the European Conferences of the Catholic Church.
[00:38:53.346 --> 00:38:57.650]  So we are talking here about this power of the Jesuits that is openly endorsing
[00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.871]  Migration, they're doing the same thing as I reported also a week ago.
[00:39:03.052 --> 00:39:10.374]  John-Claude Junker is literally a Nazi fortune heir, but the guy's like stumbling around drunk all the time now.
[00:39:10.454 --> 00:39:11.714]  I mean, I don't know what his deal is.
[00:39:12.074 --> 00:39:18.716]  But Leo, I want to bring this back to the candidacy of Joe Biden because the force is strong today.
[00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:24.598]  I was wondering how I was going to get into this with you, but it kind of parallels what I wanted to talk with you today about.
[00:39:25.818 --> 00:39:26.519]  How much power?
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.201]  Folks can go get Leo's books at Infowars.com.
[00:39:31.521 --> 00:39:32.621]  They're just amazing stuff.
[00:39:33.261 --> 00:39:42.584]  And in fact, you even, we had you on The War Room to discuss this, you even accurately predicted the New Zealand shooting in your most recent book.
[00:39:43.264 --> 00:39:56.048]  So you've been studying, you've been a part of, you've been writing about the Illuminati, the secret societies, that they've been around for hundreds of years, some aspects of these even longer, but the ones that really empower
[00:39:57.109 --> 00:40:05.539]  I would say probably came out of Germany you would agree a few hundred years ago and they've been the ones kind of bringing in all of this technology and everything but this is my question.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:13.845]  How much power over the world, should we say, do these secret societies still have?
[00:40:14.146 --> 00:40:18.409]  Do they still have the same amount of power that they had 30 years ago leading up to this point?
[00:40:19.029 --> 00:40:25.995]  And have new secret societies kind of been forming in Silicon Valley with upstarts and the technology boom and all the access?
[00:40:26.015 --> 00:40:28.957]  Has that kind of mitigated the secret society's power?
[00:40:29.237 --> 00:40:31.119]  Do they still have the power they once wielded?
[00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:33.901]  And to me, I think it all kind of
[00:40:36.075 --> 00:40:46.322]  Here's Joe Biden, the New World Order Illuminati candidate, and I mean, I don't think his chances are good, and if this is what they're banking on to try to...
[00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:53.484]  To try to take back power and control in the West, I mean, that's, like you said, I mean, the odds aren't good for them.
[00:40:53.524 --> 00:41:00.269]  So, do you think that parallels where these secret societies and the power that they've had over the world for so long?
[00:41:00.289 --> 00:41:02.071]  Do you think this parallels where they're at right now?
[00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:07.675]  Or do you think they still have the same ability to basically do and pull whatever strings they want?
[00:41:08.985 --> 00:41:13.407]  Oh, and simply have still all the cash in the world and more.
[00:41:14.007 --> 00:41:22.830]  So until you control the finances of this planet, you actually control who is printing the money, you are controlling the whole show.
[00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.031]  So I don't think that we're getting rid of these kind of people.
[00:41:26.051 --> 00:41:35.014]  I mean, they can have their internal wars, but in the end, they are the most rich and powerful people on the planet.
[00:41:35.174 --> 00:41:37.735]  And institutions like the church are also very rich.
[00:41:38.175 --> 00:41:43.100]  So how are we going to overcome this materialistic power?
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:53.129]  It's very difficult to overcome this materialistic power if not with a spiritual and cultural revolution that has to be started in a nation that is truly free.
[00:41:53.989 --> 00:42:09.295]  Nowadays, there is only the United States of America that we can call really free, because the rest of the world is falling under socialist rule and technocratic dictatorships all over the place.
[00:42:09.335 --> 00:42:15.777]  So basically, we are now, with Donald Trump, the only place in the United States of America.
[00:42:15.797 --> 00:42:17.538]  But how long is this going to last?
[00:42:17.958 --> 00:42:23.100]  I mean, they have immense power, unfortunately, Owen, not at the spiritual level.
[00:42:23.441 --> 00:42:27.542]  And that's why they're destroying places of cult.
[00:42:27.863 --> 00:42:42.949]  Because, you see, places of cult, since ancient times, Owen, are places where you gather an egregore, you gather a spiritual force through the power of prayer, through the rosaries that in the Catholic Church, the old ladies, they are
[00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:49.635]  It's the same concept that is also repeated in Islam.
[00:42:49.975 --> 00:42:50.776]  They do the same thing.
[00:42:50.796 --> 00:42:51.537]  Alright, let's talk about this.
[00:42:51.557 --> 00:42:52.598]  We're going to break, Leo.
[00:42:52.659 --> 00:42:54.200]  Let's get into more of this on the other side.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.103]  Leo Zegami is going to be with us for an hour today.
[00:42:56.523 --> 00:42:57.684]  Don't go anywhere.
[00:42:57.704 --> 00:42:58.285]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:04.406 --> 00:43:13.288]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[00:43:13.488 --> 00:43:22.311]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[00:43:22.471 --> 00:43:23.171]  It's ridiculous.
[00:43:23.311 --> 00:43:24.872]  The CoQ10 PPQ.
[00:43:25.012 --> 00:43:28.275]  We have the organically derived, and by that, it's not synthetic.
[00:43:28.535 --> 00:43:33.959]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PPQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic is expensive.
[00:43:34.019 --> 00:43:36.141]  This is the organically derived.
[00:43:36.541 --> 00:43:37.462]  This is the real stuff.
[00:43:37.642 --> 00:43:41.225]  I want to warn you, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA 4+.
[00:43:41.305 --> 00:43:49.091]  When I cut my finger off, like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there, where it cut off, it was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[00:43:49.111 --> 00:43:50.792]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[00:43:51.492 --> 00:43:52.212]  Then it poured off.
[00:43:52.492 --> 00:43:53.953]  It was numb all the way up here.
[00:43:54.073 --> 00:43:56.233]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[00:43:56.433 --> 00:43:57.974]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[00:43:58.034 --> 00:43:59.514]  First it tangled and it came back.
[00:43:59.714 --> 00:44:00.794]  I was like, this is incredible.
[00:44:00.854 --> 00:44:01.674]  But I'm going to warn you.
[00:44:01.875 --> 00:44:06.416]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[00:44:06.596 --> 00:44:10.357]  This is just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[00:44:10.557 --> 00:44:12.877]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[00:44:13.097 --> 00:44:14.878]  So it's the building blocks.
[00:44:15.158 --> 00:44:16.078]  And it's the next level.
[00:44:16.118 --> 00:44:17.058]  It's the best you're going to get.
[00:44:17.178 --> 00:44:19.939]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[00:44:19.979 --> 00:44:20.759]  We're getting into supplements.
[00:44:20.999 --> 00:44:22.821]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[00:44:22.981 --> 00:44:28.187]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[00:44:28.367 --> 00:44:32.913]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[00:44:33.233 --> 00:44:34.875]  That's a six, seven times markup.
[00:44:35.916 --> 00:44:36.697]  We're good to go.
[00:45:05.424 --> 00:45:06.425]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[00:45:23.553 --> 00:45:25.074]  This is a known patent out of France.
[00:45:25.114 --> 00:45:32.598]  You have to pay for the patent, where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[00:45:32.618 --> 00:45:35.979]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[00:45:53.228 --> 00:45:54.569]  It's pretty much straight away.
[00:45:54.589 --> 00:45:56.630]  You know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:57.471]  It just works.
[00:45:57.671 --> 00:46:03.875]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms.
[00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:08.217]  And even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[00:46:08.237 --> 00:46:10.779]  Polonblock works every single time.
[00:46:10.879 --> 00:46:12.020]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.463]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[00:46:15.483 --> 00:46:17.925]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[00:46:18.005 --> 00:46:18.845]  It's very complex.
[00:46:18.865 --> 00:46:19.686]  They don't even know why.
[00:46:19.726 --> 00:46:23.008]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[00:46:23.609 --> 00:46:30.254]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[00:46:30.394 --> 00:46:32.096]  I go out and I do market research.
[00:46:32.256 --> 00:46:34.678]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[00:46:34.878 --> 00:46:36.219]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:44.661]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a bestseller?
[00:46:44.681 --> 00:46:46.341]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[00:46:46.421 --> 00:46:51.643]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[00:46:52.163 --> 00:46:52.703]  It's not here.
[00:46:53.123 --> 00:46:56.564]  So we just made a souped-up version of it, discounted it, and it's palm-block.
[00:46:56.624 --> 00:46:57.944]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:47:06.463 --> 00:47:10.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.588 --> 00:47:30.737]  Owen Troyer here filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:47:30.757 --> 00:47:32.058]  He is still on a
[00:47:34.002 --> 00:47:43.107]  Special mission in DC, and I am joined by Leo Zegami, and we are talking about his story.
[00:47:43.707 --> 00:47:51.772]  Joe Biden, the Vatican candidate of choice for 2020, and who's really behind that and what that really means.
[00:47:52.952 --> 00:48:08.422]  And so, I mean, the things that stuck out to me, Leo, and you can get back into going into the spiritual war that you were getting into in the last segment before we had to go to break, and that's really what this comes down to, and so that's why they bring people out like
[00:48:09.827 --> 00:48:26.357]  Katie Perry to push their symbolism and stuff and then go to these conferences where they push biotech and biomedical tyranny and they roll it out like it's cool and trendy and don't worry about what's behind it, you know, don't worry about what we really want to use it for.
[00:48:27.558 --> 00:48:33.480]  And so, but they've run into kind of an obstacle here with Joe Biden not being so popular.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.482]  And so if they do force him in, I mean, America is going to be like, what the heck just happened here?
[00:48:37.522 --> 00:48:37.842]  I think.
[00:48:38.302 --> 00:48:40.783]  I don't know if America is that dead yet.
[00:48:41.543 --> 00:48:44.264]  But you were getting into the spiritual aspects of this.
[00:48:44.464 --> 00:48:48.486]  I mean, you'd see Joe Biden's creepy smile, the way he touches and gropes children and women.
[00:48:48.506 --> 00:48:52.187]  I think we understand what side of the spiritual battle he is on.
[00:48:52.807 --> 00:48:53.888]  But, you know, Leo, this is in
[00:48:55.336 --> 00:49:04.763]  I mean, this is a battle as ancient as time itself, between good and evil, and I think people are finally starting to become akin to it again.
[00:49:06.905 --> 00:49:23.398]  They are kind of starting to get, of course, aware of it, because thanks to us and other mediums that maybe before were not obtainable, we can put through our theories, our hypothesis, but also the truth.
[00:49:23.798 --> 00:49:24.179]  Thank you.
[00:49:42.413 --> 00:49:47.658]  And what was happening with Dorsey and the whole show with the tweet that these people control Silicon Valley.
[00:49:47.698 --> 00:49:50.520]  Of course, they have invested a lot of money in it.
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:55.244]  And they also ideologically control it, because that's the way it is.
[00:49:55.264 --> 00:49:59.367]  I mean, recently I was contacted by somebody in San Francisco.
[00:49:59.387 --> 00:50:07.894]  They had difficulty in organizing an event for me there because, of course, the way things are down there in California.
[00:50:08.294 --> 00:50:14.499]  But regarding Joe Biden, we have a person who is endorsed directly by the Pope.
[00:50:14.639 --> 00:50:21.704]  I mean, we're talking about a conference which was arranged with the imprimatur of the Vatican.
[00:50:21.724 --> 00:50:24.066]  This is not... Let me ask you this question, though.
[00:50:24.186 --> 00:50:26.508]  When did we see this public flip?
[00:50:27.472 --> 00:50:28.453]  From the Vatican.
[00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:29.754]  I was raised Catholic.
[00:50:29.774 --> 00:50:30.915]  I went to Catholic school.
[00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:33.417]  I saw the Pope when he came to St.
[00:50:33.477 --> 00:50:33.817]  Louis.
[00:50:35.098 --> 00:50:37.159]  I mean, I went to pro-life marches.
[00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:39.841]  When did the Catholic Church all of a sudden become pro-choice?
[00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:40.862]  I mean, this is really strange.
[00:50:41.463 --> 00:50:41.943]  When did this happen?
[00:50:41.963 --> 00:50:49.429]  Because even not too long ago, the Catholic Church and the Pope has always been publicly pro-choice, very adamant.
[00:50:50.049 --> 00:50:57.662]  Now we have a pro-life, excuse me, now we have a pro-choice, supporting pro-choice in America?
[00:50:58.183 --> 00:50:59.245]  When did this flip happen?
[00:50:59.265 --> 00:51:01.870]  I guess they're just going, they're just taking the mask off now.
[00:51:03.277 --> 00:51:12.300]  They're taking the mask off, but they have been gradually taking it off since the end of the 60s, when the Second Vatican Council started to come into fruition.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:16.781]  And people like Ratzinger, of course, but also Jesuits.
[00:51:17.061 --> 00:51:23.423]  The Jesuits were very important in the Second Vatican Council, and they came out with all these liberal policies soon after.
[00:51:23.823 --> 00:51:30.147]  So, John Paul II briefly at the beginning of the 80s started to oppose it, but then they took over the show.
[00:51:30.167 --> 00:51:33.590]  So this is really the making of the Jesuits.
[00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:40.915]  This order that really doesn't care about Christianity, actually wants to destroy Christianity in favor of this one world religion.
[00:51:41.235 --> 00:51:51.942]  So they have already secretly converted to Islam, a lot of them, because it's the religion they're going to use in the coming years.
[00:51:52.082 --> 00:51:53.343]  And they know this very well.
[00:51:53.943 --> 00:52:01.225]  The Vatican calculates also how many people, you know, are arriving from these countries, how many newborns.
[00:52:01.265 --> 00:52:06.827]  We know that in the West we don't have as many children as the Muslims, so it's very easy for them to take over the show.
[00:52:07.227 --> 00:52:14.309]  But when this show will be taken over, that's the moment in which you will have, you will receive the mark of the beast.
[00:52:14.589 --> 00:52:18.370]  That's when we will embrace... But is this just basic mathematics?
[00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:25.514]  I mean, are we talking about basic logistics with these secret societies determining that they're going to bring in Islam as the one world religion?
[00:52:25.794 --> 00:52:31.137]  Is that because there's billions and billions of Muslims out there and they can move them about the planet?
[00:52:32.527 --> 00:52:38.228]  No, I think it's because of the manipulative way they can use Islam.
[00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:46.350]  It's easier to use because here in the West they have gradually destroyed Christianity after the Age of Enlightenment.
[00:52:46.651 --> 00:52:56.273]  They have created a situation, the Illuminati here in the West, whereby we don't really care much about the Bible, at least the average person.
[00:52:56.813 --> 00:53:00.994]  In Europe especially, they're very secularized, very laicized.
[00:53:01.074 --> 00:53:24.002]  So, I mean, we are in front of a situation where you don't have Christian values like before, so Islam is still very strong, it's a combative force they can use as a Trojan horse to then install this one... Well, I actually want to bear down on this point, Leo, and I've explained this before, and this is how people like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib and these other people are getting in office, because
[00:53:25.046 --> 00:53:27.736]  You know, Christians in the West, and just in general...
[00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:33.563]  Voters in the West, they take these practices for granted now.
[00:53:33.923 --> 00:53:35.204]  Christians aren't going to church.
[00:53:35.324 --> 00:53:39.506]  That was mainstream news just last week, how church attendance is way down.
[00:53:40.006 --> 00:53:42.748]  People don't identify as even religious anymore.
[00:53:43.068 --> 00:53:44.549]  And this is all part of the propaganda.
[00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:47.150]  I experienced this when I went to college.
[00:53:47.711 --> 00:53:51.173]  There's a graph that the crew found right there, the Great Decline, 60 years of religion in America.
[00:53:51.633 --> 00:53:52.333]  It's declining.
[00:53:53.354 --> 00:53:55.455]  And so you've kind of got that happening.
[00:53:59.153 --> 00:54:00.914]  I feel that... But it's not a coincidence.
[00:54:00.974 --> 00:54:04.316]  It's been planned with the Second Vatican Council.
[00:54:04.336 --> 00:54:15.841]  You have to understand, this was a key moment in which, for the first time, the Church came together in modern times, after the Second World War, to plan this new world order.
[00:54:16.001 --> 00:54:20.543]  But what I'm saying is, what I'm saying is, Christians and voters in the West, they take it all for granted.
[00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:23.325]  When Muslims come here, they all vote.
[00:54:24.005 --> 00:54:26.987]  They all go to their religious service.
[00:54:27.067 --> 00:54:28.048]  They don't miss it, ever.
[00:54:28.228 --> 00:54:29.228]  They're always doing it.
[00:54:29.288 --> 00:54:37.754]  And so that's why, I forget, I did a breakdown of this, but you can go look at the numbers specifically using a case study, Ilhan Omar's district.
[00:54:38.134 --> 00:54:44.438]  Muslim voter turnout for that district was like 98% compared to the rest, which was down at like 60%.
[00:54:45.518 --> 00:54:51.022]  So yeah, Muslims come here and they engage because they can practice their religion freely.
[00:54:51.782 --> 00:54:54.584]  And they engage because they have these rights to vote.
[00:54:54.844 --> 00:54:59.846]  And so they realize, so it's kind of like, oh, we can use that and manipulate that.
[00:54:59.906 --> 00:55:02.108]  Christians and Westerners aren't voting.
[00:55:02.148 --> 00:55:03.468]  They aren't praying.
[00:55:03.508 --> 00:55:05.129]  They aren't procreating.
[00:55:05.489 --> 00:55:07.911]  But these people we're bringing in from the Middle East, they are.
[00:55:08.291 --> 00:55:10.212]  So we kind of use that as the new power wing.
[00:55:11.579 --> 00:55:15.403]  I saw it myself when I used to live in Scandinavia with my own eyes.
[00:55:15.843 --> 00:55:26.153]  Muslims were very active politically in places like Oslo, for example, in Norway, and I mean they were taking over already seats in the local
[00:55:27.974 --> 00:55:32.737]  We're going to see more and more Islamic political parties in the next few years coming up all over the place.
[00:55:32.757 --> 00:55:34.559]  So they're going to be like a plague.
[00:55:34.699 --> 00:55:35.739]  And the fact that they can expand
[00:55:52.085 --> 00:55:58.028]  It doesn't mean necessarily that they are promoting terrorism, but they are covering up for a lot of terrorism.
[00:55:58.048 --> 00:56:02.349]  We're kind of digressing from the main topic, but I kind of want to actually continue down this road for a second.
[00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:13.214]  I mean, if they're going to, because they all vote Democrat, I mean, they just had the story, it was like, I think 80 or 75 percent or something vote Democrat, Muslim voters.
[00:56:13.654 --> 00:56:14.294]  So what do we do?
[00:56:14.334 --> 00:56:15.415]  I mean, I sit here and I'm like, well,
[00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:22.514]  It's Muslims in the UK that are fighting against the queer education or teaching kids how to be trans and gay.
[00:56:24.075 --> 00:56:27.378]  It's the Muslims in the West that I feel like will fight against that same thing.
[00:56:28.279 --> 00:56:34.784]  Have Democrats and Muslims that vote Democrat, have they just not had this clash of ideologies realized yet?
[00:56:34.844 --> 00:56:36.105]  Or do you think that they just don't care?
[00:56:37.401 --> 00:56:38.041]  They don't care.
[00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:43.163]  The interests that are moved from on top of all this, they don't really care.
[00:56:43.183 --> 00:56:54.568]  I mean, you have to understand that the Illuminati of Adam and Eve, when they were born in 1776, they were really inspired by some elements of the Muslim tradition.
[00:56:54.949 --> 00:56:58.350]  And they filtered it through the secret societies that took their place.
[00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:04.553]  So basically, Islam has always had a secret footstep here in the West.
[00:57:05.553 --> 00:57:14.203]  In these secret societies that secretly have dealt with unspeakable deals with the Muslim world.
[00:57:14.543 --> 00:57:24.795]  And so we are in front of a conspiracy to destroy Christianity, but also in the end they will destroy Islam when they don't need it any longer.
[00:57:25.215 --> 00:57:31.078]  I mean, the thing is that the ordinary Muslims, they lose themselves.
[00:57:31.118 --> 00:57:36.101]  We're going to break here, but yeah, I mean, if they can get a one-world religion, it's really going to be Satanism.
[00:57:36.561 --> 00:57:39.943]  I mean, they'll claim it's atheism or whatever, but it's really Satanism.
[00:57:40.723 --> 00:57:41.723]  So we'll get into that.
[00:57:42.224 --> 00:57:43.004]  Leo, we've got to take a break.
[00:57:43.284 --> 00:57:45.605]  Leo Zagami with us, leozagami.com.
[00:57:46.306 --> 00:57:49.607]  All of his books are at infowarsstore.com, his articles at leozagami.com.
[00:57:49.627 --> 00:57:50.108]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:52.827 --> 00:57:55.990]  BrainForce Plus is a top-tier nootropic.
[00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:57.191]  Focus.
[00:57:57.951 --> 00:57:58.492]  Clarity.
[00:57:58.912 --> 00:57:59.212]  Energy.
[00:57:59.853 --> 00:58:04.277]  But instead of having a 7x markup, we have a 150% markup.
[00:58:05.318 --> 00:58:07.479]  Right now, it's massively discounted.

[01:00:02.301 --> 01:00:13.886]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:15.947]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:00:28.888 --> 01:00:54.497]  Well, I think at some point in your life, you looked around at humanity, you analyzed where it was going, you went back into the past, saw where it came from, and just kind of shook your head in disbelief, thought, this can't be what our destiny is, this can't be what we were meant for.
[01:00:55.677 --> 01:00:57.298]  Got corrupted somewhere along the way.
[01:00:58.351 --> 01:01:00.533]  Some of us made a deal with the devil.
[01:01:01.853 --> 01:01:09.018]  So Leo Zegami is expert, all things expert, when it comes to secret societies and the Vatican.
[01:01:09.819 --> 01:01:13.822]  And he's got his latest story, Joe Biden, the Vatican candidate of choice for 2020.
[01:01:14.742 --> 01:01:16.544]  But isn't that what it all really is, Leo?
[01:01:16.604 --> 01:01:18.285]  Isn't that what it all really boils down to?
[01:01:18.345 --> 01:01:24.129]  These people have made deals with entities that they believe are the devil.
[01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:26.925]  Of course.
[01:01:27.806 --> 01:01:38.492]  And we have to understand that Islam is important for them because these entities are very present in this religion.
[01:01:38.552 --> 01:01:39.672]  They call them jinn.
[01:01:40.473 --> 01:01:44.035]  They have also a mysterious figure known as al-Qadir.
[01:01:44.055 --> 01:01:46.396]  A lot of paganism.
[01:01:47.751 --> 01:01:55.356]  A lot of elements of magic that are then present also in a minor way sometimes in Christianity.
[01:01:55.416 --> 01:02:06.282]  But I was just reading a moment ago something written in the context of Crowleyanity, Alistair Crowley, who was a big admirer of Islam.
[01:02:06.582 --> 01:02:12.566]  He actually identified Mohammed, the prophet of Islam, with a saint of his own church.
[01:02:12.886 --> 01:02:13.747]  So how comes
[01:02:14.668 --> 01:02:19.456]  One of the biggest Satanists, Alistair Crowley, is identifying the Prophet of Islam as a saint.
[01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:21.974]  This should give you an idea.
[01:02:22.694 --> 01:02:32.198]  Also, the fact that it condones pedophilia, Islam, it gives, of course, for the future, the Vatican, they all love it, you know?
[01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:33.839]  Islam, of course.
[01:02:34.019 --> 01:02:36.220]  Let's open a caliphate in the Vatican.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.180]  Let's open a sultanate in the Vatican.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:46.824]  This is what is going to happen soon, because they have already changed behind closed doors their religion.
[01:02:48.385 --> 01:02:56.473]  So do you think though, do you think we could actually see a physical representation of this in Paris at the Notre Dame Cathedral?
[01:02:56.493 --> 01:02:59.617]  Because they said they're gonna have a competition, I mean, you know.
[01:03:00.656 --> 01:03:03.878]  Quote-unquote, to decide what they're going to do with the new spire in the top.
[01:03:03.918 --> 01:03:19.868]  I mean, to me, this gives them an opening, at least, to put a crowning jewel on France with some globalist or Illuminati symbolism up there, and that'll be like their physical marking, like, we captured you.
[01:03:21.704 --> 01:03:23.385]  Well, they want to build a minaret.
[01:03:23.445 --> 01:03:26.607]  That's what one of the proposals is saying.
[01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:33.812]  And I think that it's not far-fetched to say that this is definitely not going to be a traditional Christian church.
[01:03:33.832 --> 01:03:36.194]  It's going to be open to all religions.
[01:03:36.534 --> 01:03:39.176]  And they have already done this experiment.
[01:03:39.556 --> 01:03:47.042]  A few years ago, in secret, in Rome, in a church, one of the most ancient churches of Christianity, was desecrated by this experiment.
[01:03:48.222 --> 01:03:49.543]  The Church of St.
[01:03:49.583 --> 01:04:03.152]  Croix in Jerusalem, they used it for a period of time, I think it was around six months of time, they started using one of the chapels for all the religions, as a one-world religion chapel.
[01:04:03.452 --> 01:04:05.013]  And this was done in Rome!
[01:04:05.573 --> 01:04:05.673]  Yeah.
[01:04:05.693 --> 01:04:15.040]  And it was done almost covertly for a number of months until, of course, they started to be a little bit of media exposure around this thing.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:21.584]  And so in the church, which actually is not the church in Jerusalem, is the church where they keep the nails of the cross.
[01:04:21.604 --> 01:04:30.030]  So Christ is also regarded as the most ancient church in Christianity because it was the villa of the mother of the Emperor Constantine.
[01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:34.432]  They actually started to open up to the one word religion 10 years ago.
[01:04:35.653 --> 01:04:40.878]  Well, to me, to me, we're going to break here, short break.
[01:04:41.218 --> 01:04:42.880]  To me, you just made a bold prediction.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:47.624]  And I mean, if I was a betting man, your predictions are about as solid as they get.
[01:04:48.104 --> 01:04:57.993]  So you think that they're going to not just have some symbolism with a new spire or top, they're going to just go and just remove it as a Catholic or Christian monument in general.
[01:04:58.493 --> 01:05:00.255]  More from Leo Zagami on the other side of this short break.
[01:05:03.939 --> 01:05:05.921]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:05:06.322 --> 01:05:12.569]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:16.895]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[01:05:30.365 --> 01:05:41.868]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[01:05:42.348 --> 01:05:51.591]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.

[01:06:09.168 --> 01:06:15.034]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[01:06:15.695 --> 01:06:17.296]  It's Owen Troyer.
[01:06:17.957 --> 01:06:20.699]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:24.803]  And we're joined by Leo Zagami, always informative.
[01:06:25.884 --> 01:06:28.027]  And so, Leo, I want to just get right back into this.
[01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:31.371]  Because you made, to me, a pretty bold prediction.
[01:06:31.391 --> 01:06:35.714]  I think people should stick that in their back pocket and wait for it to come true.
[01:06:36.454 --> 01:06:50.182]  You're predicting they're going to kind of transfer the meaning or the practice inside of the Notre Dame Cathedral away from being Christian and Catholic church services to being a one world religion center.
[01:06:50.982 --> 01:06:58.809]  And then I'm expecting them to have a physical manifestation of this when they replace the spire with some new, different symbolism.
[01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:02.552]  Which, by the way, and maybe we get to this in the next segment, is all over the United States.
[01:07:03.273 --> 01:07:04.474]  But we won't get into that now.
[01:07:04.834 --> 01:07:07.997]  So Leo, I mean, it's like this.
[01:07:08.477 --> 01:07:10.899]  This is actually perfect for you to comment on.
[01:07:11.983 --> 01:07:39.646]  Did you see the picture, and the rumors are out there about what it is, but a picture of Michelle Obama toasting, you know, with the champagne glass, and it appears in the reflection, I mean, she was on a boat going on a river cruise right by the cathedral, that we know is true, but it appears in the reflection of the picture that they put out, it appears that she's toasting champagne while the cathedral is burning.
[01:07:40.467 --> 01:08:01.113]  And, I mean, it seems so out there, it seems so far-fetched, but when you really know what's going on, you know the dark Satanism that's going on, and then you even understand the psychology, and I don't even want to get into the psychology of a, potentially, who a Michael Obama really is, but, but, I mean, Leo, was this an Illuminati sacrifice?
[01:08:01.153 --> 01:08:05.174]  I mean, was this a big date, like 9-11 changed the way of the West?
[01:08:05.494 --> 01:08:08.415]  Was this a big monumental moment for the Illuminati in Europe?
[01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:10.551]  Absolutely.
[01:08:10.832 --> 01:08:16.400]  Because like I was trying to explain to you before, it's a very complex thing to explain, but very synthetically.
[01:08:17.081 --> 01:08:23.170]  Inside every church, you give energy by praying a specific prayer, of course, of your religion.
[01:08:25.776 --> 01:08:31.301]  You want to change this force, you want to detonate, you want to basically eliminate it.
[01:08:31.461 --> 01:08:37.966]  You have to bend out that place because that place is full of these energies that have been kept there for centuries.
[01:08:37.986 --> 01:08:43.190]  So the moment in which you use fire, fire is a specific element in Islam.
[01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:49.736]  The genies of fire is the demonic ones who really have power over the dark forces.
[01:08:50.316 --> 01:08:52.618]  This is actually, I just want to put this into layman's terms.
[01:08:53.138 --> 01:09:12.896]  Basically, so you have all of this powerful energy worshipping God, empowering God, bringing humans together from all around the world to this cathedral, praising Jesus, using that positive energy which is still in Europe that they're trying to destroy right now, and so you burn it down with fire, and if you look into these occult
[01:09:13.556 --> 01:09:14.477]  Yes, the energy is liberated
[01:09:41.724 --> 01:09:49.609]  And you're never going to recover that those prayers because they're going to just go up to the heavens where they belong to.
[01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:57.655]  But that power was for many centuries in this place, like many others of worship.
[01:10:00.877 --> 01:10:06.143]  The only way is to destroy the place and then rebuild it with a different kind of worship.
[01:10:06.183 --> 01:10:10.528]  This was done many times in the past, even before Christianity.
[01:10:10.568 --> 01:10:13.672]  We had pagan cults that then Christianity took over.
[01:10:13.972 --> 01:10:19.078]  I mean, some places have a specific connotation because they are placed
[01:10:19.878 --> 01:10:24.999]  There, where there is electromagnetic forces that are specific to that longitude and latitude.
[01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:27.480]  So, Notre Dame is that place.
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:36.042]  And it's a key place, together with the pyramid that you know in Paris was built, a relatively new pyramid that we find in Paris.
[01:10:36.442 --> 01:10:43.964]  Now we have Notre Dame going down, and of course, then we have to have another form of worship.
[01:10:44.444 --> 01:10:45.525]  And you're already seeing that.
[01:10:45.565 --> 01:10:46.606]  They won't even say Christianity.
[01:10:46.626 --> 01:10:48.268]  They say Easter worshipers now.
[01:11:05.939 --> 01:11:08.901]  Yeah, you have to understand also the beliefs of the Muslims.
[01:11:08.962 --> 01:11:19.630]  When you go in a mosque, there is no symbols of any kind, really, apart from many geometrical patterns, but it is forbidden to have anything that resembles an image.
[01:11:19.991 --> 01:11:24.054]  Well, and that's the other thing, too, because there is a lot of paganism when it comes to Islam.
[01:11:24.134 --> 01:11:28.758]  I mean, that's the incredible thing about this, Leo.
[01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:31.080]  And I think everybody... What's that?
[01:11:32.136 --> 01:11:42.259]  They give their energy each day, all together, millions of individuals worldwide, a certain amount of times a day, with a certain amount of prayers.
[01:11:42.479 --> 01:11:45.380]  That is their power, and it's pointed towards Mecca.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:57.684]  But don't you think though, but yeah, so Mecca, you know, whatever, but whatever it is, again, I just view it as paganism, but what I'm saying is, I feel like though, I feel like a certain
[01:11:58.644 --> 01:12:02.126]  There was something else happening to humanity all at once, because we're all connected.
[01:12:02.146 --> 01:12:04.727]  I mean, we were all connected, divinely.
[01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:18.174]  And I think people were watching the Notre Dame Cathedral burn, and at the end of the day, I mean, what really happened, we don't know, but at the end of the day, nobody died or got hurt, it was just a structure that burned, but there was, everybody knew there was something else happening.
[01:12:18.494 --> 01:12:21.156]  Everybody was so enamored by it, and they didn't even know why!
[01:12:22.236 --> 01:12:22.917]  But that's it!
[01:12:22.997 --> 01:12:25.258]  I mean, it's an unbelievable transfer of energy!
[01:12:26.198 --> 01:12:31.502]  And there was the Al-Aqsa Mosque burning at the same time in Jerusalem.
[01:12:32.123 --> 01:12:36.606]  That is something also which fits this whole show.
[01:12:37.047 --> 01:12:41.150]  Because in the end of the day, yes, Notre Dame is going down.
[01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:48.476]  But let me show you that the next ones to go down after this Christianity goes down, then it's going to be Islam.
[01:12:49.016 --> 01:12:50.798]  So this is a diabolical plan.
[01:12:50.838 --> 01:12:54.661]  This is a satanic plan that even the Muslims know themselves about.
[01:12:55.313 --> 01:12:57.515]  But unfortunately, they're falling trap.
[01:12:58.736 --> 01:13:01.177]  They're in a trap themselves.
[01:13:01.217 --> 01:13:08.423]  So I am saying today to your viewers that here there is powers that are not of this earth only.
[01:13:08.503 --> 01:13:14.347]  When I talked before about Mecca, there is a mysteries regarding Mecca that go well beyond
[01:13:16.108 --> 01:13:31.412]  Islam, because it's something that goes into antiquity, something that is to do with probably a meteorite that is not of this planet, that is worshipped and creates energy, and that when you go around it, you create a certain amount of energy.
[01:13:31.452 --> 01:13:38.674]  So these are things that, of course, will have to be studied and understood.
[01:13:39.034 --> 01:13:45.016]  But if, in a simple way, we can say that there are mantras in Arabic that they will start to recite
[01:13:45.737 --> 01:13:54.615]  Daily next to Notre Dame until they get into Notre Dame and then they can worship their God and take over the place.
[01:13:55.595 --> 01:14:10.461]  So we're going to be following this, Leo, because I have a feeling that this will probably come down in just kind of like, it'll go uncovered like the one other church you mentioned in Italy, where they just kind of bring in like, oh, it's a one religion, you know, everybody's welcome here.
[01:14:10.561 --> 01:14:13.562]  And then they'll eventually say, oh, no, but Christianity is offensive.
[01:14:13.602 --> 01:14:15.523]  They're already symboling that that's what they're going to do.
[01:14:15.543 --> 01:14:16.463]  They won't say Christians.
[01:14:16.483 --> 01:14:17.684]  They say Easter worshipers.
[01:14:18.444 --> 01:14:22.466]  And I would imagine that this is probably going to happen pretty soon because they've already
[01:14:23.506 --> 01:14:25.547]  They're already pushing to rebuild the cathedral.
[01:14:25.567 --> 01:14:31.608]  I want to give a scoop today to your viewers, just something that maybe you should think about.
[01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:39.351]  The Muslims hate the cross, but there is a reason that was also embraced by the Knights Templars.
[01:14:40.371 --> 01:14:42.612]  They believe that Jesus didn't die on the cross.
[01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:43.892]  It says it on the Koran.
[01:14:44.132 --> 01:14:46.073]  At the last minute, they sent somebody else.
[01:14:47.393 --> 01:14:50.414]  Now, the Knights Templar embrace this.
[01:14:51.391 --> 01:15:06.415]  And they made it into the 30th degree initiation of the ancient and accepted Scottish Rite, in which the Knights Templars are basically spitting on the cross, not because of disrespect necessarily to Jesus, but to the fact that he was put on the cross.
[01:15:07.555 --> 01:15:11.896]  So then there is people who say that Jesus lived long.
[01:15:12.176 --> 01:15:13.436]  I went into the Middle East.
[01:15:13.696 --> 01:15:14.417]  I went to Egypt.
[01:15:14.557 --> 01:15:20.278]  I studied in the Coptic churches to understand if there was some basis to these theories that Jesus lived.
[01:15:22.148 --> 01:15:25.213]  And from my experience, I found that he lived.
[01:15:26.314 --> 01:15:29.158]  And this is historic.
[01:15:29.439 --> 01:15:35.388]  But of course, it would change the face of Christianity to know that he didn't die
[01:15:36.295 --> 01:15:43.138]  Or that his dying was symbolic, and that he then... I can't even believe that you went down this road.
[01:15:43.178 --> 01:15:58.585]  I didn't plan on doing this in the final segment with you, but now I feel like we have to talk about this in the final segment here, or maybe even hold you longer, but... Yeah, that's kind of a big thing, and I've always wondered, because I see false flags and stuff happening now, that's not new.
[01:15:58.645 --> 01:16:00.045]  The Romans used to do that stuff too.
[01:16:00.065 --> 01:16:01.566]  I mean, so it's like, who knows what happens?
[01:16:02.605 --> 01:16:05.766]  Brain Force Plus is a top-tier nootropin.

[01:19:09.798 --> 01:19:15.820]  American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:19.421]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.181]  How can I solve that problem?

[01:20:22.222 --> 01:20:24.124]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:26.367]  Owen Troyer filling in for Alex today.
[01:20:27.568 --> 01:20:29.190]  Should be back with us tomorrow.
[01:20:29.631 --> 01:20:30.912]  Leo Zagami is my guest.
[01:20:31.233 --> 01:20:40.824]  Now, Leo just dropped a bombshell on us here, I guess you could say, in the last segment, and I just want to reiterate it, make sure I understood it correctly.
[01:20:42.810 --> 01:20:57.847]  There is a certain sect of the Scottish Rite, which is linked to the Freemasons in the West, which is linked to the founding of this country, that teaches at the highest levels, essentially, that the crucifixion of Jesus was a false flag.
[01:20:59.449 --> 01:21:02.670]  And that it was not actually Jesus that was crucified that day.
[01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:07.352]  So Leo, I can't let you say that and then not get more into it.
[01:21:07.712 --> 01:21:09.632]  Leo Zagami from leozagami.com.
[01:21:09.932 --> 01:21:12.733]  His books are at infowars.com, infowarsstore.com.
[01:21:13.193 --> 01:21:14.714]  Leo, did I hear you right?
[01:21:16.027 --> 01:21:17.448]  Yeah, no, you heard me totally right.
[01:21:17.548 --> 01:21:20.649]  Of course, this will come as a narrative for many Christians.
[01:21:21.129 --> 01:21:24.591]  And God forbid that I'm taking into that direction.
[01:21:24.631 --> 01:21:25.591]  No, absolutely.
[01:21:25.951 --> 01:21:33.134]  I always believe that Jesus for me is the Lord in the sense that he incarnated God in his essence.
[01:21:33.434 --> 01:21:36.456]  But the fact that he died on the cross, that's
[01:21:39.957 --> 01:21:44.600]  I, for many years, was part of the Knights Templars myself.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:46.601]  I was part of this new world order.
[01:21:46.761 --> 01:21:59.188]  I saw certain things and I learned certain things that, in the end, demonstrated that Jesus didn't die on the cross and that the Koran, which actually says that somebody else was sent there at the last minute, dying for him,
[01:21:59.988 --> 01:22:01.529]  Might actually be correct.
[01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:07.554]  This doesn't mean, I'm not condoning anything in regards to Islam against Christianity.
[01:22:07.634 --> 01:22:11.157]  That is completely wrong, because Jesus made certain teachings very clear.
[01:22:11.597 --> 01:22:19.283]  And of course, these animals, like the cardinal in Sri Lanka calls them animals, because they are animals, are Muslims.
[01:22:19.603 --> 01:22:26.108]  And their religion is very combative, is a warrior caste religion.
[01:22:26.528 --> 01:22:40.600]  And of course, it has nothing to do with Jesus, who is bringing a message of peace into the world, not only of conquering the world to then give it into the hands of God and of Jesus, because even the Koran is stating that.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:47.646]  In the Koran, actually, in the end times, it's Jesus that comes back, because Mohammed is nowhere to be seen.
[01:22:48.067 --> 01:22:54.012]  So it's Jesus who is coming back to then unify this whole show.
[01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:58.374]  And that's where the Muslims are hoping we are going to get to.
[01:22:58.814 --> 01:23:08.118]  In the meantime, I remember in the 80s when there was this important Sufi Shaikh Nazim, he was asked what these entities were, these UFOs.
[01:23:08.138 --> 01:23:13.920]  He said very clearly that UFOs were driven by these genes.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:20.503]  The operators of this craft were entities, extra-dimensional entities called genes.
[01:23:21.332 --> 01:23:37.225]  So this inspired me also in the making of a book which I wrote and I published this year called The Invisible Masters, Secret Chiefs, Unknown Superiors and the Puppet Masters, who literally pulled the strings of occult power from the alien world.
[01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:44.871]  In Mecca there is even a mosque which is dedicated to these invisible beings, the jinn.
[01:23:45.881 --> 01:23:49.562]  And if you go inside there, it seems completely empty.
[01:23:49.902 --> 01:23:54.884]  But if you stay there for more than 10 minutes, you will be kicked out by an invisible force.
[01:23:55.324 --> 01:24:11.068]  So, I mean... Hold on a second here, because this is like the next level stuff I really wanted to talk with you about today, but I almost feel like I have to ask you, I mean, if it wasn't Jesus on the cross, not who was it, but then what did they teach happened to Jesus?
[01:24:12.887 --> 01:24:16.648]  Well, there is many writings about what happened to Jesus.
[01:24:16.888 --> 01:24:30.332]  Some of them were destroyed during the Council of Nicaea, which was this foundation moment for Christianity, but also a moment in which some truths around Jesus were hidden away.
[01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:40.195]  It is said that he went to spend some time in Egypt, at least I found some evidence that he spent some time in Egypt, before going towards the Far East.
[01:24:40.815 --> 01:24:47.639]  So what are the stories then from the Bible that talk about Jesus coming back to the apostles with the holes in his hand?
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:50.501]  Well, of course.
[01:24:50.921 --> 01:24:55.924]  But what happens here is that we are believing in a version of events.
[01:24:55.964 --> 01:25:00.146]  I'm not saying that my version or the versions that I have discovered during my studies are correct.
[01:25:00.506 --> 01:25:02.667]  I'm just simply saying that... No, no, no.
[01:25:02.747 --> 01:25:06.449]  You're literally getting into what they teach in these higher seeker societies.
[01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:09.051]  Which, by the way, here's the amazing thing too, Leo.
[01:25:10.556 --> 01:25:22.766]  Well, you have people, Owen, that you can put nails through there and they can survive because they have reached such holiness that these things don't really touch their body.
[01:25:23.086 --> 01:25:26.628]  So Jesus himself will have not been necessarily touched.
[01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:30.131]  But he has said... I just had to ask that.
[01:25:30.451 --> 01:25:31.472]  That is important.
[01:25:31.592 --> 01:25:32.973]  But he went into the earth.
[01:25:33.013 --> 01:25:37.377]  He went down into the land of the dead.
[01:25:37.477 --> 01:25:38.658]  That is also said.
[01:25:39.466 --> 01:25:41.406]  By who believes he lived on.
[01:25:41.686 --> 01:25:48.768]  But then he went on to live and there is actually a tomb that you can find, just Google it, Kashmir Tomb of Jesus.
[01:25:49.608 --> 01:25:56.529]  And that tomb, that specific tomb, is regarded also by the Muslims as being the tomb of Jesus.
[01:25:57.130 --> 01:26:08.972]  In the far land of Kashmir, which in this moment is also a very delicate situation there geopolitically, because as we know there is an open confrontation going on between Pakistan and India regarding Kashmir.
[01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:11.653]  And I mean, here's the thing, too.
[01:26:11.713 --> 01:26:14.515]  You learn this for whatever reason.
[01:26:15.235 --> 01:26:25.522]  It's like, the people that are in these occult societies that worship Satan, they really are afraid of Jesus.
[01:26:25.542 --> 01:26:28.464]  It's like, I mean, it's like the real Voldemort to them.
[01:26:28.484 --> 01:26:30.085]  Like, oh my gosh, they shudder at the name.
[01:26:30.105 --> 01:26:31.225]  And this has always been through history.
[01:26:31.245 --> 01:26:34.708]  But you know, here's how I want to leave this interview because it's been so powerful.
[01:26:36.389 --> 01:26:36.629]  You know,
[01:26:38.533 --> 01:26:46.700]  It's like you talked about the invisible forces inside the Muslim mosque, where you don't think there's anything there.
[01:26:49.522 --> 01:26:50.282]  How should I say this, Leo?
[01:26:50.302 --> 01:26:51.983]  I mean, what is this world?
[01:26:52.963 --> 01:26:54.403]  This world is not what we think it is.
[01:26:54.543 --> 01:27:01.505]  I mean, you talked about the, we know, I mean, and the other thing too is like, elites throughout time have always been into this.
[01:27:01.845 --> 01:27:11.367]  They've always been into the spirituality and the different realms and everything, but now in the 21st century, it's like that's taboo or like low IQ somehow to be into God and
[01:27:11.687 --> 01:27:35.459]  Alternate dimensions and all this stuff when it's like the most advanced level of IQ like people that meditate their whole lives want to reach this level of of Enlightenment and so Leo I mean What do you think this is because I mean when we're when you're sitting in a room and these invisible forces are around you They are literally occupying the same space as you just in a different dimension
[01:27:37.645 --> 01:27:38.406]  Yes, they are.
[01:27:38.646 --> 01:27:49.655]  And actually, I spoke with somebody who went to this mosque and was kicked out of this mosque after five minutes with a voice basically that talked to his ear.
[01:27:50.455 --> 01:27:52.777]  And then he started to feel a knock here.
[01:27:52.797 --> 01:27:54.699]  He said, you're not meant to be here.
[01:27:54.899 --> 01:27:55.920]  You're not meant to be here.
[01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:59.542]  And then they completely dragged him out of the place.
[01:27:59.963 --> 01:28:01.164]  I mean, the guy
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:02.901]  Was not a bullshit.
[01:28:03.421 --> 01:28:10.868]  He was really, you know, a very devout Muslim, and I knew him personally, so I can say that he was not lying.
[01:28:10.908 --> 01:28:12.609]  But Leo, so that's the amazing thing, though.
[01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:20.456]  I mean, this is the most, to me, this is the most enlightened, illuminating conversations that you can have, questioning existence, questioning our reality.
[01:28:21.136 --> 01:28:27.538]  Asking what are these mysteries of life, but it's like this weird thing now where it's not even taboo It's like it's like low.
[01:28:27.619 --> 01:28:36.822]  It's like lowballing people It's like oh like that's old hat like you're a you're a caveman talking about creation and God It's like it's like what planet do you live on?
[01:28:39.336 --> 01:28:40.176]  Well, what planet?
[01:28:40.296 --> 01:28:46.802]  Regarding planets and actually stars, Sirius is mentioned two times, I think, at least, in the Koran.
[01:28:47.323 --> 01:28:51.527]  And Sirius is also something... Alright, Leo, this has been an amazing hour.
[01:28:51.567 --> 01:28:53.028]  I'm gonna get you back on the War Room soon.
[01:28:53.048 --> 01:28:53.909]  We're gonna do this again.
[01:28:53.969 --> 01:28:54.510]  Great stuff.
[01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:56.351]  LeoZagami.com.
[01:28:56.431 --> 01:28:59.434]  I've just got too much news I gotta get to, Leo, but that was an unbelievable hour.
[01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:00.155]  Just great stuff.

[01:30:03.092 --> 01:30:06.096]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[01:30:06.456 --> 01:30:12.384]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[01:30:12.804 --> 01:30:18.631]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[01:30:18.992 --> 01:30:21.615]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[01:30:21.895 --> 01:30:29.402]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[01:30:29.422 --> 01:30:37.630]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[01:30:38.231 --> 01:30:42.495]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[01:30:43.354 --> 01:30:46.955]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[01:30:47.155 --> 01:30:53.118]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[01:30:54.098 --> 01:31:02.961]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[01:31:03.502 --> 01:31:07.683]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[01:31:07.723 --> 01:31:09.444]  You're probably going, wait a minute.
[01:31:10.538 --> 01:31:12.361]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[01:31:12.381 --> 01:31:13.663]  It was the last run.
[01:31:13.683 --> 01:31:14.624]  It's been sold out for two months.
[01:31:15.748 --> 01:31:16.569]  How is X2 back?
[01:31:17.089 --> 01:31:20.692]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[01:31:21.152 --> 01:31:24.255]  We got put over the barrels, some industrial sabotage we couldn't get anymore.
[01:31:24.835 --> 01:31:34.863]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[01:31:34.943 --> 01:31:38.867]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[01:31:39.307 --> 01:31:40.428]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[01:31:40.848 --> 01:31:45.190]  You need to do research into iodine and the iodine conspiracy for yourself.
[01:31:45.650 --> 01:31:47.451]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[01:31:47.851 --> 01:31:49.151]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[01:31:49.692 --> 01:31:51.953]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[01:31:52.513 --> 01:31:54.774]  What, like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews?
[01:31:55.374 --> 01:31:58.896]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[01:31:59.716 --> 01:32:02.117]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:05.759]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[01:32:05.999 --> 01:32:18.387]  So from our brain waves to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[01:32:18.848 --> 01:32:21.369]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[01:32:21.930 --> 01:32:23.070]  So iodine is amazing.
[01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.691]  It's important.
[01:32:23.711 --> 01:32:25.932]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[01:32:26.012 --> 01:32:26.533]  They'll hurt you.
[01:32:26.913 --> 01:32:27.593]  This is pure.
[01:32:27.874 --> 01:32:28.594]  This is clean.
[01:32:28.914 --> 01:32:29.695]  This is amazing.
[01:32:30.035 --> 01:32:31.816]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[01:32:33.357 --> 01:32:36.999]  X2, our overall best-selling product, is now back.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:42.063]  X2 original from the very first original manufacturer.
[01:32:42.463 --> 01:32:48.987]  The exact same X2 at M4WarsLife.com, M4WarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:32:49.047 --> 01:32:50.848]  As I said, get your pre-orders in.
[01:32:51.208 --> 01:32:51.969]  Week, week and a half.
[01:32:51.989 --> 01:32:53.430]  It's being labeled right now.
[01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:54.230]  It's already been bottled.
[01:32:54.490 --> 01:33:01.014]  And we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at M4WarsStore.com, M4WarsLife.com.
[01:33:01.074 --> 01:33:02.075]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:33:05.891 --> 01:33:12.052]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.794 --> 01:33:29.375]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.835 --> 01:33:32.976]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:34.785 --> 01:33:36.586]  Powerful hour with Leo Zegami.
[01:33:36.906 --> 01:33:49.910]  I would have loved to have kept him on, but I've just got to get to some of this news, and I've got my guest coming up in the third hour, who was protesting the drag queen story time.
[01:33:52.116 --> 01:34:01.638]  But before I even get to that, I need to take care of business here and put some gas in the tank because we're running low right now and I don't even think I've plugged yet.
[01:34:02.338 --> 01:34:08.379]  So at InfowarsStore.com, we still have the 50% off all apparel special happening right now.
[01:34:08.959 --> 01:34:12.580]  So that's expired 48 hours ago and we're still giving it to you.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:16.701]  50% off all apparel at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:34:17.581 --> 01:34:21.723]  So, all the t-shirts, which, I mean, I can't even keep track of all the t-shirts we have now.
[01:34:21.783 --> 01:34:23.563]  I mean, dozens of designs to choose from.
[01:34:24.364 --> 01:34:29.145]  The polos, the hoodies, the ball caps, the stocking caps.
[01:34:29.846 --> 01:34:30.846]  We've got patches.
[01:34:31.566 --> 01:34:32.807]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:34:32.867 --> 01:34:34.768]  It's all 50% off.
[01:34:35.568 --> 01:34:37.669]  We're basically just giving these t-shirts away right now.
[01:34:38.369 --> 01:34:40.510]  So, go to InfoWarsTore.com, become a billboard.

[01:34:57.638 --> 01:35:02.900]  But while you're there, don't forget to check out all the great supplements, read the reviews.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:07.903]  We've got air filters, water filters, I mean more and more every day I'm seeing stories about
[01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:20.976]  In fact, I just saw a story today, I should have kept it, but I think it's on Drudge, see if you guys can pull it up, how air pollutant levels are about to go through a real bad time.
[01:35:22.377 --> 01:35:26.619]  With all the toxins in the air and all the pollen and everything, you don't want to be breathing this stuff in.
[01:35:27.338 --> 01:35:44.666]  And so we don't want to breathe this stuff in, so we're like, hmm, okay, let's go out and find an air filter that we can put in our home, and so let's get the best one at the best price, and let's private label it, and let's sell it at Infowarsstore.com, and then we can share the gift of fresh air in the home that we give to ourselves.
[01:35:45.847 --> 01:35:47.228]  There's the story from USA Today.
[01:35:47.348 --> 01:35:49.449]  Bad air is on the rise.
[01:35:51.158 --> 01:35:53.859]  And then they have a list of, I guess, all the most polluted cities.
[01:35:54.159 --> 01:36:01.801]  And, of course, now the studies have come out that your home is as polluted with toxins in the air as the average metropolitan city.
[01:36:01.821 --> 01:36:03.342]  So don't live like that.
[01:36:03.402 --> 01:36:04.542]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:04.582 --> 01:36:06.563]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:36:06.903 --> 01:36:07.943]  The best air filters.
[01:36:08.544 --> 01:36:10.964]  Money can buy at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:36:11.024 --> 01:36:12.005]  I've got two in my home.
[01:36:12.885 --> 01:36:14.445]  I absolutely enjoy them.
[01:36:14.606 --> 01:36:20.267]  I would not occupy any other domicile without an Alexa Pure Breeze.
[01:36:20.507 --> 01:36:21.227]  Absolutely.
[01:36:21.687 --> 01:36:22.368]  It's a must-have.
[01:36:22.388 --> 01:36:24.028]  So are the water filters at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:36:24.048 --> 01:36:29.990]  And again, your support at InfoWarsTore.com makes everything possible.
[01:36:33.783 --> 01:36:38.166]  Let me just dive in to these stacks of news that I have here.
[01:36:38.587 --> 01:36:40.148]  No rhyme or reason particularly.
[01:36:41.229 --> 01:36:43.650]  I'm just going to start picking up stories and getting into it.
[01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:46.192]  Now this is actually incredible as Alex is in DC.
[01:36:46.853 --> 01:36:54.718]  The ACLU, you know, I was reading this and covering this and I have another story about this right here.
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:56.480]  You know,
[01:36:59.215 --> 01:37:02.278]  How do you even, how do I even properly cover this?
[01:37:02.318 --> 01:37:04.499]  I mean, it's the same thing like we have a wide open border.
[01:37:04.559 --> 01:37:06.161]  Now, I've got news on that I'll get to here too.
[01:37:07.182 --> 01:37:10.765]  Wide open border, guns coming across, drugs coming across, human trafficking.
[01:37:10.785 --> 01:37:11.685]  I mean, it's all going on.
[01:37:11.705 --> 01:37:13.907]  You know, hey, nothing to see here.
[01:37:14.348 --> 01:37:15.328]  Don't build that wall.
[01:37:15.388 --> 01:37:16.149]  No national emergency.
[01:37:16.169 --> 01:37:17.350]  And it's Trump's fault actually.
[01:37:18.051 --> 01:37:19.191]  Somehow it's Trump's fault too.
[01:37:19.212 --> 01:37:24.096]  I mean, so that's as insane as it gets.
[01:37:24.116 --> 01:37:25.857]  I mean, you just look at that.
[01:37:25.897 --> 01:37:26.818]  It's basic common sense.
[01:37:26.978 --> 01:37:27.919]  You have a border.
[01:37:29.332 --> 01:37:31.153]  You have a country, you have a border.
[01:37:31.614 --> 01:37:32.454]  We have no border.
[01:37:34.736 --> 01:37:38.318]  And then we also pay for everyone to come here.
[01:37:39.839 --> 01:37:41.180]  And then we pay them when they get here.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.282]  It's madness that this is happening.
[01:37:46.223 --> 01:37:46.703]  It's maddening.
[01:37:47.344 --> 01:37:49.085]  And Americans are fed up with it.
[01:37:50.246 --> 01:37:51.587]  But I'm not even sure what's worse.
[01:37:52.387 --> 01:37:53.588]  Is it that you have
[01:37:55.339 --> 01:37:58.462]  To me, by the actual U.S.
[01:37:58.522 --> 01:38:00.725]  Code, these are treasonous politicians.
[01:38:00.985 --> 01:38:03.688]  These Democrats are committing treason by the U.S.
[01:38:03.728 --> 01:38:06.831]  Code, allowing these non-citizens to come into this country.
[01:38:07.111 --> 01:38:11.856]  They're killing people, they're spreading disease, they're committing crimes, it's all in the U.S.
[01:38:11.916 --> 01:38:14.399]  Code, and the Democrats are committing treason.
[01:38:15.509 --> 01:38:21.673]  Now, I don't know how many times I have to highlight this, and I'm not going to make the crew go grab the actual document from my desk.
[01:38:22.013 --> 01:38:22.733]  I covered it nauseam.
[01:38:23.154 --> 01:38:30.218]  But it's like, okay, so there's one level of just total insanity that we're enduring, but I'm not sure what's worse.
[01:38:31.559 --> 01:38:32.539]  So you have the 2020 Census coming up.
[01:38:34.039 --> 01:38:38.640]  President Trump says, I just want to have a question on the census that says, are you a US citizen?
[01:38:39.161 --> 01:38:42.442]  And the average response would be, that's not on there already?
[01:38:42.462 --> 01:38:43.802]  And of course it was!
[01:38:44.442 --> 01:38:51.064]  It was on the census for 200 years, until those Democrats got a hold of it, and they took it off.
[01:38:53.225 --> 01:38:55.866]  And so, the Supreme Court is about to hear this.
[01:38:57.037 --> 01:39:00.382]  And justices seem ready to okay asking citizenship on census.
[01:39:00.422 --> 01:39:00.862]  Well, of course.
[01:39:01.443 --> 01:39:01.964]  And here's the thing.
[01:39:02.384 --> 01:39:12.678]  They've already run through all the loops and all the hoops and all the red tape with these damn treasonous Democrats who want to bring in the third world population to vote them into power.
[01:39:14.827 --> 01:39:15.908]  They already wrote all the laws.
[01:39:16.628 --> 01:39:19.050]  No other government bureaucracy.
[01:39:19.090 --> 01:39:19.991]  Not the IRS.
[01:39:20.151 --> 01:39:21.452]  Not the CIA.
[01:39:21.612 --> 01:39:23.514]  Not the Border Patrol.
[01:39:23.634 --> 01:39:24.454]  Not ICE.
[01:39:24.614 --> 01:39:24.995]  Nothing.
[01:39:25.495 --> 01:39:27.337]  No one can use the U.S.
[01:39:27.377 --> 01:39:27.817]  Census.
[01:39:28.157 --> 01:39:29.278]  It cannot be used.
[01:39:29.398 --> 01:39:30.599]  It's already written into law.
[01:39:30.819 --> 01:39:34.922]  It's all confidential and it can only be used by the Census Bureau.
[01:39:35.223 --> 01:39:38.545]  If anyone else uses that data, they're criminally charged.
[01:39:38.945 --> 01:39:40.787]  So they've already written all of this into law.
[01:39:41.670 --> 01:39:42.811]  And what are the Democrats saying now?
[01:39:43.011 --> 01:39:44.012]  Even though they've already written the laws.
[01:39:44.032 --> 01:39:44.472]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:39:44.492 --> 01:39:45.393]  These people are insane.
[01:39:45.633 --> 01:39:51.939]  They write the laws, they already have all the laws on the books, and then they keep bitching about the problem they already wrote the laws about.
[01:39:51.979 --> 01:40:00.706]  So they say, oh, we, the ACLU, we can't have a citizenship question on the test.
[01:40:01.046 --> 01:40:03.769]  Then ICE is going to use it to arrest non-citizens.
[01:40:03.989 --> 01:40:05.010]  Well, okay, first you say,
[01:40:07.085 --> 01:40:10.187]  So wait a second, you're now openly supporting criminals.
[01:40:10.207 --> 01:40:13.188]  I mean, you're now openly supporting lawlessness.
[01:40:13.329 --> 01:40:13.829]  And they are!
[01:40:14.309 --> 01:40:15.530]  But that's not even the problem!
[01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:21.273]  So sure, it's one level of insanity that you now openly support crime.
[01:40:22.794 --> 01:40:26.776]  But let's just leapfrog the fact that you now openly support criminals in this country.
[01:40:27.837 --> 01:40:29.678]  And let's now go to the point that you don't even want
[01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:41.478]  A question you're so brain dead, you're so committed to your treason and your political correct insanity, you don't even want a question on the census that asks, are you a citizen?
[01:40:41.799 --> 01:40:43.980]  So we have no idea how many people are in this country illegally.
[01:40:45.241 --> 01:40:46.883]  And you know, I don't know how much I want to get into this.
[01:40:47.904 --> 01:40:48.444]  In fact, screw it.
[01:40:48.484 --> 01:40:49.405]  I'm just going to do it here on air.
[01:40:49.525 --> 01:40:50.866]  This is what I'm going to do.
[01:40:51.607 --> 01:40:52.447]  Here's what you need to do, folks.
[01:40:53.268 --> 01:40:54.549]  And I already know census workers.
[01:40:54.689 --> 01:40:55.330]  So I'm just going to do that.
[01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:56.691]  I'm blasting this out to everyone.
[01:40:56.751 --> 01:40:57.572]  So it's about to go around.
[01:40:57.972 --> 01:40:58.773]  Everyone's going to hear this now.
[01:40:59.952 --> 01:41:05.375]  You need to sign up to be a census worker and go work the census.
[01:41:06.415 --> 01:41:08.136]  And I've talked to census workers.
[01:41:08.236 --> 01:41:09.057]  You know what they tell me?
[01:41:09.857 --> 01:41:15.460]  They are stunned how many non-citizens they find that are living in their neighborhood.
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:16.541]  Stunned.
[01:41:17.641 --> 01:41:18.001]  Stunned.
[01:41:20.022 --> 01:41:22.344]  And I've already put the idea in some people's heads.
[01:41:22.484 --> 01:41:23.524]  I'm just putting it out there now.
[01:41:24.064 --> 01:41:24.465]  Sign up.
[01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:25.465]  Work for the Census Bureau.
[01:41:27.026 --> 01:41:28.707]  And I think you know where I'm going with this.
[01:41:29.645 --> 01:41:30.587]  Don't do anything illegal!
[01:41:33.894 --> 01:41:35.457]  But you want to see how bad it really is?
[01:41:36.579 --> 01:41:38.543]  Work for the Census in 2020.
[01:41:39.445 --> 01:41:40.127]  You'll be stunned.
[01:41:41.915 --> 01:41:42.975]  But they don't want to know.
[01:41:43.316 --> 01:41:45.356]  They don't want this problem to be solved.
[01:41:45.476 --> 01:41:46.957]  They want illegal immigration.
[01:41:47.057 --> 01:41:48.397]  They want them to stay here.
[01:41:48.437 --> 01:41:49.618]  They want more welfare.
[01:41:49.658 --> 01:41:51.158]  They want to break this country's back.
[01:41:51.418 --> 01:41:51.738]  Why?
[01:41:52.119 --> 01:41:53.179]  Your guess is as good as mine.
[01:41:53.219 --> 01:41:54.139]  These people are Satanists.
[01:41:54.359 --> 01:41:54.960]  They're treasonists.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:55.540]  They hate people.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.100]  They're blackmailed.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.160]  I don't know what their problem is.
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:00.221]  They're just programmed this way, by the intelligent design.
[01:42:00.261 --> 01:42:01.582]  This is just the battle we have to fight.
[01:42:03.182 --> 01:42:04.563]  But here's the ACLU.
[01:42:06.465 --> 01:42:11.749]  To fight against the citizenship question on the 2020 Census and they've got a line of people.
[01:42:11.989 --> 01:42:13.210]  Someone needs to go to D.C.
[01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:14.130]  and bullhorn these people.
[01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:16.672]  I mean, what do you do?
[01:42:16.812 --> 01:42:24.577]  What do you do with a Democrat Party that doesn't want to have a border and doesn't want to have a citizenship question on the 2020 Census?
[01:42:29.020 --> 01:42:30.141]  You want to save the country?
[01:42:31.842 --> 01:42:32.783]  You'd lock them all up.
[01:42:34.633 --> 01:42:35.734]  They're committing open treason.
[01:42:35.774 --> 01:42:37.215]  This is an open and shut case.
[01:42:38.136 --> 01:42:47.564]  Any legal team or prosecuting attorney or president of the United States that has the cojones to do it could do it tomorrow!
[01:42:47.804 --> 01:42:50.246]  They're committing open treason against this country!
[01:42:50.426 --> 01:42:51.107]  But guess what?
[01:42:51.929 --> 01:42:58.114]  They're about to show you their true colors when the Supreme Court says, yeah, you can ask citizenship on the census.
[01:42:58.455 --> 01:43:01.878]  They're going to go into complete tirades for non-citizens.
[01:43:03.139 --> 01:43:05.060]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[01:43:05.301 --> 01:43:08.123]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:43:08.343 --> 01:43:15.910]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:43:16.931 --> 01:43:19.473]  Some of the most polluted areas on Earth are major cities.
[01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:21.234]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:43:21.614 --> 01:43:38.247]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology, and we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:43:38.287 --> 01:43:41.870]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul
[01:43:42.190 --> 01:43:45.774]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:43:46.174 --> 01:43:47.876]  I've got two in my home.
[01:43:48.016 --> 01:43:53.622]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:43:54.103 --> 01:43:58.587]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[01:43:58.768 --> 01:43:59.488]  Have clean air.
[01:43:59.849 --> 01:44:01.130]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:04.122 --> 01:44:04.783]  E.T.
[01:44:04.803 --> 01:44:05.543]  on in Texas.
[01:44:05.583 --> 01:44:07.464]  You're on the air.
[01:44:07.484 --> 01:44:08.305]  Go ahead.
[01:44:08.505 --> 01:44:08.925]  Greetings.
[01:44:09.245 --> 01:44:09.526]  Welcome.
[01:44:34.042 --> 01:44:37.563]  And I hope to hear from you again, and I will always keep in touch with you.
[01:44:37.703 --> 01:44:38.923]  God bless you, Etion.
[01:44:39.083 --> 01:44:40.223]  I never plug Icarin.
[01:44:40.303 --> 01:44:43.864]  All we do is go out and see what is the best product already out there, and make it even stronger and better.
[01:44:43.884 --> 01:44:44.884]  What has the best ratings.
[01:44:44.904 --> 01:44:48.345]  So for kidney and liver, Icarin as a flush, it's powerful.
[01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:51.046]  But if you're already in a weird state, consult a physician.
[01:44:51.066 --> 01:44:55.307]  A lot of companies have a bunch of marketing, but they sell kind of filler because they're scared of real supplements.
[01:44:55.347 --> 01:45:00.268]  I mean, real supplements can really help you, but also, you know, if you're in a weird place, you can get crazy.
[01:45:00.288 --> 01:45:01.708]  So Icarin and InfoWareStore.com.
[01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:04.551]  The good news is...
[01:45:06.016 --> 01:45:15.783]  After a year and a half long battle to secure the deep-earth crystals that nobody else has for the purest atomic iodine out there, we have been able to secure X2.
[01:45:16.483 --> 01:45:17.984]  I was sure we weren't going to be able to get it.
[01:45:18.344 --> 01:45:21.126]  It's a derivative that the oil companies get between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[01:45:21.606 --> 01:45:32.734]  There's globalist industrial espionage that goes on where they try to not just take our sponsors and things, but actually stop us from getting the raw material because this is under DEA control to get the raw stuff because it's so powerful.
[01:45:33.294 --> 01:45:35.536]  So X2, after being sold out for several months,
[01:45:36.636 --> 01:45:40.838]  We were able to get it back into production from its original producer, and we now have it.
[01:45:41.218 --> 01:45:44.399]  And it is the purest, best, good halogen out there.
[01:45:44.839 --> 01:45:50.040]  Just research how IQs went down massively in the Midwest because they didn't have any iodine in the soil.
[01:45:50.421 --> 01:45:54.422]  Once the government added it, it just did all of these insanely good things.
[01:45:54.742 --> 01:45:55.302]  Research.
[01:45:55.922 --> 01:45:56.462]  It's incredible.
[01:45:56.723 --> 01:45:57.563]  One of God's great gifts.
[01:45:58.303 --> 01:45:59.164]  So X2's back.
[01:45:59.284 --> 01:46:00.305]  It's in about a week and a half.
[01:46:00.325 --> 01:46:01.866]  You can pre-order it at Infowarshore.com.
[01:46:01.886 --> 01:46:03.487]  I almost forgot.
[01:46:03.727 --> 01:46:06.729]  25% off out of the gates to celebrate the fact that it's back.
[01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:09.271]  I forgot that part.
[01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:10.432]  25% off X2.
[01:46:10.833 --> 01:46:11.833]  A lot of you have experienced it.
[01:46:11.853 --> 01:46:12.354]  You've loved it.
[01:46:12.414 --> 01:46:13.054]  A lot of you haven't.
[01:46:13.435 --> 01:46:13.955]  Try it out.
[01:46:13.995 --> 01:46:14.716]  Fund the operation.
[01:46:15.316 --> 01:46:17.338]  The bad news is, outside of our audience...
[01:46:18.137 --> 01:46:24.679]  People don't know that Iodine is needed for electrochemical activity in the brain, or for your hormones, or for everything that happens in your body.
[01:46:25.059 --> 01:46:29.121]  And if you don't have it, you absorb the bad allergens like Chlorine and Fluoride and other things.
[01:46:30.001 --> 01:46:33.302]  So get your X2 original today and share it with people.
[01:46:33.743 --> 01:46:35.943]  Tell them about the Iodine conspiracy.
[01:46:36.283 --> 01:46:38.684]  Because the bad news is a lot of people don't know.
[01:46:39.805 --> 01:46:39.825]  X2.
[01:46:41.414 --> 01:46:44.195]  It's been sold out for months, but it's coming back in right now.
[01:46:44.256 --> 01:46:47.137]  Good news for folks that are on AutoShip and Infowarshore.com.
[01:46:47.417 --> 01:46:50.239]  Sign up for AutoShip to make sure you get every month, every two months, whatever you want.
[01:46:50.459 --> 01:46:54.881]  Cancel any time and you will get 10% off additionally on 25% off.
[01:46:55.241 --> 01:46:56.082]  X2's back!
[01:46:56.442 --> 01:46:59.203]  Now explain to people how critical iodine is.
[01:46:59.263 --> 01:47:00.364]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[01:47:01.425 --> 01:47:02.265]  X2's back!
[01:47:06.847 --> 01:47:09.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:15.607 --> 01:47:20.430]  You know, the Bible talks about your body being a temple of God.
[01:47:20.710 --> 01:47:21.871]  And it is.
[01:47:44.428 --> 01:48:01.958]  This is basically just a meat suit with our soul, our spirit, our inter-dimensional, next-level, touched-by-God's-divinity existence is trapped in this body.
[01:48:01.978 --> 01:48:02.638]  But it's a temple.
[01:48:03.659 --> 01:48:04.899]  It's how we were designed.
[01:48:07.541 --> 01:48:12.304]  And that's how God is here on this planet through us.
[01:48:13.373 --> 01:48:16.075]  Through our existence, through the temple.
[01:48:18.936 --> 01:48:31.084]  And so, when you realize that, you understand why the devil is constantly attacking your temple.
[01:48:31.984 --> 01:48:37.147]  You understand why the devil is constantly trying to infiltrate your temple.
[01:48:38.208 --> 01:48:39.609]  Tries to infiltrate your mind,
[01:48:40.902 --> 01:48:43.524]  Literally tries to infiltrate your physical body.
[01:48:44.965 --> 01:48:49.047]  And so that's what the Mark of the Beast represents.
[01:48:50.868 --> 01:49:00.374]  And it's manifested when they force you to take a vaccine, when they force you to put a chip into your body, and that will come next.
[01:49:01.955 --> 01:49:04.037]  But that's the Mark of the Beast.
[01:49:04.917 --> 01:49:08.840]  I mean, you just look at what's going on right now where they celebrate
[01:49:09.784 --> 01:49:36.626]  Unhealthiness, and they say hey look if you point out that someone's out of shape and overweight And how that's bad for them help for their health your body shaming them No God gave you one temple To take care of and to experience this existence for yourself through And as soon as the devil
[01:49:37.765 --> 01:50:02.814]  Corrupt your temple as soon as the devil can destroy your temple You can no longer experience this consciousness as You were intended And that's why there's a constant attack a Constant assault on your mind on your body and on your spirit.
[01:50:02.894 --> 01:50:04.135]  That is the devil
[01:50:05.074 --> 01:50:07.736]  Trying to infiltrate your temple.
[01:50:09.337 --> 01:50:17.324]  Now, I don't know why I went off on that tangent, but I do have some other news to get to before my next guest joins me.
[01:50:18.410 --> 01:50:21.431]  Let's get into what President Trump tweeted out this morning.
[01:50:21.471 --> 01:50:27.774]  Now, yesterday, I got a little upset and started yelling at the audience.
[01:50:27.834 --> 01:50:36.097]  I apologize because, well, not at the audience, but through the microphone because of what happened to the troops at the southern border.
[01:50:36.117 --> 01:50:38.839]  I mean, just unheard of for U.S.
[01:50:38.899 --> 01:50:42.580]  troops to be disarmed by Mexican soldiers on U.S.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:42.880]  soil.
[01:50:42.900 --> 01:50:46.462]  And I was sitting here just, I mean, really upset by it.
[01:50:47.772 --> 01:50:50.173]  I think the president caught on and he tweeted this out.
[01:50:50.333 --> 01:50:57.377]  Mexico's soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the border.
[01:50:58.237 --> 01:50:59.138]  Better not happen again.
[01:50:59.218 --> 01:51:01.759]  We are now sending armed soldiers to the border.
[01:51:01.839 --> 01:51:04.880]  Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending and returning.
[01:51:06.481 --> 01:51:06.861]  So key.
[01:51:09.603 --> 01:51:10.003]  It's time.
[01:51:10.723 --> 01:51:12.684]  It's just refreshing to have a president that stands up.
[01:51:14.105 --> 01:51:16.166]  But you know, honestly, I would have liked to seen a
[01:51:17.583 --> 01:51:21.366]  That's an Oval Office address on this issue.
[01:51:24.088 --> 01:51:25.349]  And quite frankly, we still need it.
[01:51:25.389 --> 01:51:26.911]  The drugs are still pouring across the border.
[01:51:26.971 --> 01:51:28.972]  The human trafficking is still going on rampantly.
[01:51:30.093 --> 01:51:31.815]  Guns are pouring across, drugs are pouring across.
[01:51:31.835 --> 01:51:32.355]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:51:32.615 --> 01:51:39.080]  The President and the First Lady are talking right now at a drug convention or whatever, an anti-drug addiction convention.
[01:51:41.162 --> 01:51:42.243]  We can go to B-roll of Trump.
[01:51:42.263 --> 01:51:43.064]  He's live right now.
[01:51:44.662 --> 01:51:51.385]  And, yeah, it probably is the Mexican army smuggling drugs, getting paid off under the table.
[01:51:52.165 --> 01:51:53.526]  The president is absolutely correct.
[01:51:54.126 --> 01:51:56.207]  The cartels run the Mexican government, folks.
[01:51:56.567 --> 01:52:02.150]  Anybody that tries to get into Mexican politics that's not run by the cartels ends up pushing daisies.
[01:52:03.551 --> 01:52:05.391]  Over 200 times last year alone.
[01:52:06.132 --> 01:52:08.593]  So, that's what's really going on here.
[01:52:09.721 --> 01:52:11.342]  Maybe that's what the Democrats are aligned with.
[01:52:11.722 --> 01:52:12.722]  But it's just getting worse.
[01:52:13.282 --> 01:52:14.943]  We've been rolling the b-roll all day.
[01:52:15.523 --> 01:52:18.344]  Heavily armed men escort migrants across U.S.
[01:52:18.384 --> 01:52:19.824]  borders surveillance video shows.
[01:52:19.844 --> 01:52:22.765]  Well, why are heavily armed men escorting migrants across the border?
[01:52:23.145 --> 01:52:24.606]  Why would you have heavily armed men?
[01:52:25.326 --> 01:52:26.547]  Oh, it's a business.
[01:52:26.927 --> 01:52:27.147]  You see?
[01:52:28.087 --> 01:52:29.428]  It's a business.
[01:52:29.628 --> 01:52:31.548]  Someone's making money.
[01:52:32.089 --> 01:52:36.170]  They're either pushing drugs or they're trafficking humans, folks.
[01:52:36.931 --> 01:52:39.532]  They're protecting their property.
[01:52:40.312 --> 01:52:40.932]  See how that works?
[01:52:41.892 --> 01:52:42.513]  No emergency, though.
[01:52:42.553 --> 01:52:43.013]  No big deal.
[01:52:43.453 --> 01:52:47.114]  Border Patrol finds abandoned toddler with name and phone number on shoes.
[01:52:47.375 --> 01:52:50.736]  You know how we end up with an abandoned toddler at the border?
[01:52:51.096 --> 01:52:52.657]  Because we have a wide open border.
[01:52:53.437 --> 01:52:55.878]  And people in Central America and Mexico know it.
[01:52:57.626 --> 01:52:57.926]  Shut.
[01:52:58.627 --> 01:52:59.027]  Down.
[01:52:59.647 --> 01:53:00.147]  The border.
[01:53:01.788 --> 01:53:05.470]  Trump suggests Mexican soldiers disarmed US troops as a cover for drug smuggling.
[01:53:07.131 --> 01:53:09.292]  Yeah, and he's probably right.
[01:53:10.513 --> 01:53:14.355]  And you know, you got these... These Democrats.
[01:53:14.375 --> 01:53:14.995]  They're not Democrats.
[01:53:15.015 --> 01:53:16.896]  You got these anti-American scum.
[01:53:16.996 --> 01:53:18.337]  We really need to find a name for them.
[01:53:19.777 --> 01:53:20.678]  They're like the Redcoats.
[01:53:20.698 --> 01:53:24.620]  They're like the original... Benedict Arnolds.
[01:53:25.260 --> 01:53:27.001]  They're like the new Benedict Arnolds, though.
[01:53:28.353 --> 01:53:35.597]  So you've got the Benedict Arnold Party aligned with drug cartels, aligned with human traffickers.
[01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:39.780]  That's what you have here.
[01:53:42.562 --> 01:53:43.282]  And why is it?
[01:53:44.363 --> 01:53:47.665]  You seriously, I mean, this is so beyond frustrating for me.
[01:53:47.685 --> 01:53:53.609]  It's like, and just how, why am I having to debate people
[01:53:54.702 --> 01:53:55.803]  About having a border.
[01:53:55.963 --> 01:53:59.045]  Like, why is this even a political football right now?
[01:54:00.286 --> 01:54:01.848]  How is this even real?
[01:54:02.148 --> 01:54:04.750]  Why can't we come together to stop human trafficking?
[01:54:05.250 --> 01:54:05.851]  I went out!
[01:54:06.311 --> 01:54:12.316]  I went out to Democrat offices in Austin and said, can we come together to stop human trafficking at the border?
[01:54:12.596 --> 01:54:13.697]  They wouldn't even say yes!
[01:54:14.257 --> 01:54:15.638]  They won't even say yes to that!
[01:54:21.423 --> 01:54:21.903]  Oh my gosh.
[01:54:24.136 --> 01:54:32.960]  So, we're just gonna have a wide open border, and we're just gonna let drugs pour across the border and guns pour across the border.
[01:54:33.121 --> 01:54:34.121]  Oh, we're anti-gun!
[01:54:34.401 --> 01:54:35.322]  We don't want guns!
[01:54:35.562 --> 01:54:36.382]  Make gun laws!
[01:54:36.622 --> 01:54:42.885]  Well, if you have a wide open frickin' southern border, they'll just start pouring over from the southern border, you jack... you idiots!
[01:54:43.126 --> 01:54:43.526]  Excuse me.
[01:54:43.766 --> 01:54:44.526]  I'm getting frustrated.
[01:54:44.546 --> 01:54:45.707]  I need to just put this story down.
[01:54:48.891 --> 01:54:53.172]  I can't believe we have millions of Benedict Arnolds in this country now.
[01:54:53.572 --> 01:54:54.272]  Millions of them.
[01:54:56.472 --> 01:54:57.693]  One of them is Brian Stelter.
[01:54:57.793 --> 01:54:58.493]  You know, this guy.
[01:55:00.953 --> 01:55:01.913]  This is so rich.
[01:55:02.994 --> 01:55:04.994]  Steve Watson has the story at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:05.074 --> 01:55:06.394]  I mean, look at this guy.
[01:55:07.454 --> 01:55:08.335]  CNN Stelter.
[01:55:08.715 --> 01:55:12.695]  Trump avoiding correspondents' dinner is an attack against the media.
[01:55:12.935 --> 01:55:14.196]  Oh my gosh, Brian.
[01:55:15.116 --> 01:55:16.156]  You are pathetic.
[01:55:18.186 --> 01:55:20.107]  You are just pathetic.
[01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:26.109]  Can you imagine how pathetic Brian Stelter is in real life?
[01:55:29.370 --> 01:55:32.311]  Brian, why would the president waste his time with you?
[01:55:32.391 --> 01:55:33.191]  You have no audience.
[01:55:33.411 --> 01:55:36.132]  By the way, the latest CNN ratings just came out.
[01:55:36.592 --> 01:55:37.793]  They literally have no audience.
[01:55:38.573 --> 01:55:39.833]  I mean, nothing.
[01:55:39.993 --> 01:55:42.634]  Their cume is like peaking at 300,000.
[01:55:43.214 --> 01:55:51.756]  And that's 60, 70, 80% of it's just TVs on at hotels and gyms and bars and crap.
[01:55:52.116 --> 01:55:53.476]  Nobody's watching CNN.
[01:55:54.456 --> 01:55:54.936]  Nobody!
[01:55:54.956 --> 01:56:05.198]  I mean, CNN is getting beaten by reruns of television shows like Family Guy and anything else.
[01:56:06.799 --> 01:56:08.079]  CNN is a joke.
[01:56:10.323 --> 01:56:19.165]  And so, but it's like, as they're spiraling into complete irrelevance, they're just begging the president for a bone.
[01:56:20.205 --> 01:56:22.345]  Throw us a bone, says Brian Stelter.
[01:56:25.066 --> 01:56:25.966]  Stelter, here's an idea.
[01:56:26.446 --> 01:56:28.466]  Why don't you try reporting something real?
[01:56:30.887 --> 01:56:33.847]  I mean, unless you're not allowed to do that at CNN.
[01:56:34.867 --> 01:56:39.088]  Maybe contractually, you're obligated to be fake news if you report at CNN.
[01:56:40.849 --> 01:56:44.133]  But again, so maybe Brian Stelter feels this way.
[01:56:44.893 --> 01:56:48.277]  He's such a pathetic loser, he actually says it though.
[01:56:48.557 --> 01:56:54.763]  So he actually goes, you know, he can be all bitter and tied up inside how he's a total failure, a total loser, nobody watches his show.
[01:56:56.065 --> 01:56:57.766]  And fine, I understand how you would feel that way.
[01:56:58.726 --> 01:57:00.367]  But to come out and say it!
[01:57:00.567 --> 01:57:01.928]  He's coming out begging for attention!
[01:57:01.948 --> 01:57:03.149]  He's like, look at me!
[01:57:03.590 --> 01:57:04.791]  I'm a pathetic loser!
[01:57:05.031 --> 01:57:06.031]  Please, President!
[01:57:06.952 --> 01:57:07.993]  Please give me attention!
[01:57:08.073 --> 01:57:08.934]  I'm Brian Stelter!
[01:57:10.134 --> 01:57:13.197]  If I polish my chrome dome a little shinier, would you see me then?
[01:57:15.538 --> 01:57:22.624]  If I put on face paint to look like Pennywise, would you follow me then, Mr. President?
[01:57:24.405 --> 01:57:26.767]  Brian, you guys have no audience at CNN.
[01:57:29.229 --> 01:57:29.929]  You're a joke!
[01:57:32.691 --> 01:57:34.311]  You're an absolute joke, Brian.
[01:57:36.432 --> 01:57:36.992]  Wait, what's this?
[01:57:38.413 --> 01:57:38.913]  Oh my gosh.
[01:57:39.794 --> 01:57:42.415]  The crew is telling me Brian Stelter has actually called in.
[01:57:43.235 --> 01:57:43.975]  This is unbelievable.
[01:57:44.676 --> 01:57:47.097]  So, Brian Stelter is going to join us in the next segment.
[01:57:47.197 --> 01:57:49.478]  Apparently, he doesn't like what I've said about him.
[01:57:53.527 --> 01:58:02.434]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[01:58:02.614 --> 01:58:11.420]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.301]  It's ridiculous.
[01:58:12.421 --> 01:58:13.982]  The CoQ10 PPQ.
[01:58:14.123 --> 01:58:17.365]  We have the organically derived, and by that it's not synthetic.
[01:58:17.646 --> 01:58:23.070]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even the synthetic is expensive.
[01:58:23.150 --> 01:58:25.232]  This is the organically derived.
[01:58:25.672 --> 01:58:26.593]  This is the real stuff.
[01:58:26.753 --> 01:58:38.203]  I want to warn you though, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there where it cut off, it was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[01:58:38.223 --> 01:58:39.905]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[01:58:40.605 --> 01:58:41.366]  Then tore it off.
[01:58:41.626 --> 01:58:43.047]  It was numb all the way up here.
[01:58:43.207 --> 01:58:45.349]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[01:58:45.549 --> 01:58:47.111]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[01:58:47.151 --> 01:58:48.652]  First it tingled and it came back.
[01:58:48.832 --> 01:58:49.933]  I was like, this is incredible.
[01:58:49.973 --> 01:58:50.794]  But I'm going to warn you.
[01:58:50.994 --> 01:58:55.537]  Most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[01:58:55.718 --> 01:58:59.481]  This isn't just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
[01:58:59.681 --> 01:59:02.003]  It really does regenerate nerves in many areas.
[01:59:02.243 --> 01:59:04.024]  So it's the building blocks.
[01:59:04.304 --> 01:59:05.205]  And it's the next level.
[01:59:05.245 --> 01:59:06.186]  It's the best you're going to get.
[01:59:06.306 --> 01:59:09.068]  I remember saying, what's the top selling thing like six years ago?
[01:59:09.108 --> 01:59:09.889]  We're getting into supplements.
[01:59:10.109 --> 01:59:11.971]  And well, it's PQQ and CoQ10.
[01:59:12.091 --> 01:59:17.297]  But mainly, people at grocery stores don't want to pay that, so they buy synthetic stuff that's still 50, 60 bucks for a little bottle.
[01:59:17.497 --> 01:59:22.003]  But at medical clinics, it's not prescription, but people are willing to pay, you know, 300, 400 bucks.
[01:59:22.023 --> 01:59:24.005]  That's a 6, 7 times markup.
[01:59:25.026 --> 01:59:25.806]  We're good to go.
[01:59:56.653 --> 02:00:00.594]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:00.654 --> 02:00:08.417]  Well, we just pulled every human being on Earth in the break.
[02:00:08.497 --> 02:00:12.438]  I just pulled almost 7 billion people.
[02:00:12.518 --> 02:00:16.000]  And the results are in.
[02:00:27.389 --> 02:00:32.311]  The people of the world agree, Brian Stelter is the biggest loser in the history of television.
[02:00:35.393 --> 02:00:38.455]  I'm actually honored to be joined by the biggest loser in the history of television.
[02:00:38.535 --> 02:00:43.877]  It's quite a milestone to accomplish for Brian Stelter here today, to be the biggest loser in the history of television.
[02:00:43.897 --> 02:00:44.518]  But he's called in.
[02:00:45.898 --> 02:00:51.001]  He has a beef with the president because he won't be going to the Correspondents' Dinner, which they didn't want him at anyway.
[02:00:53.772 --> 02:00:55.313]  What seems to be your problem here?
[02:00:55.393 --> 02:00:58.674]  Why are you so upset that Trump isn't going to the Correspondents' Dinner?
[02:01:06.217 --> 02:01:09.398]  You know, the bit doesn't really work until you switch it, so let's just start it back again.
[02:01:09.578 --> 02:01:09.878]  Okay.
[02:01:12.079 --> 02:01:12.419]  Brian!
[02:01:13.649 --> 02:01:19.291]  Pennywise Stelter from CNN has just been polled as the biggest loser in the history of TV.
[02:01:20.091 --> 02:01:23.452]  He joins me now because he's upset and he has something to say to the President.
[02:01:23.492 --> 02:01:25.873]  He realized the President is listening to Infowars and not CNN.
[02:01:25.913 --> 02:01:29.754]  So Brian, you finally have an audience here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:30.734 --> 02:01:32.355]  So what would you like to say to the President?
[02:01:34.215 --> 02:01:36.456]  I think that the President is a little man.
[02:01:37.476 --> 02:01:41.978]  He's a small man who doesn't have the courage to face a real man like me.
[02:01:43.237 --> 02:01:50.723]  You know, just because I don't even tie my own necktie or tie my own shoes, my mother is still kind enough to help me with that every morning.
[02:01:51.913 --> 02:02:00.418]  She just let me brush my own teeth, but just because my own mother has to tuck me in at night doesn't mean I'm a small man.
[02:02:01.179 --> 02:02:05.962]  And just because my ratings are almost at zero doesn't mean I'm a small man.
[02:02:06.022 --> 02:02:08.063]  I'm actually a very large man, as you can see here.
[02:02:08.723 --> 02:02:14.367]  But I'm mad right now because the President is refusing to go to the Correspondents' Dinner.
[02:02:15.808 --> 02:02:21.461]  Obviously the President is not aware that the Constitution says he must attend the Correspondents' Dinner.
[02:02:22.859 --> 02:02:33.165]  Obviously the President has not read the Declaration of Independence, which clearly states the Correspondents' Dinner must be attended by the President and his family.
[02:02:33.906 --> 02:02:37.608]  The President must endure the abuse by the media.
[02:02:38.448 --> 02:02:49.035]  Now, I had something very special planned for the President this year, and I know that I'm not the only one, but he's avoiding us now, and he won't go to the Correspondents' Dinner.
[02:02:50.936 --> 02:02:58.560]  Well, since the President isn't going to the Correspondents' Dinner, Brian, would you care to enlighten us what it is you were going to do?
[02:03:00.901 --> 02:03:14.787]  Well, I'll give InfoWars the exclusive right now, but all of us in the media, we're going to superglue ourselves together and build a human wall around President Trump so that he cannot leave.
[02:03:15.767 --> 02:03:18.469]  And we will basically build a human dome
[02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:21.721]  To trap President Trump and save the world.
[02:03:22.941 --> 02:03:24.821]  But he must have found this out.
[02:03:25.781 --> 02:03:26.882]  Because now he's avoiding us.
[02:03:27.762 --> 02:03:28.862]  And so I have a new plan.
[02:03:30.122 --> 02:03:32.483]  I'm going to sneak on to the White House grounds.
[02:03:33.663 --> 02:03:34.984]  I'm going to sneak through the fence.
[02:03:35.564 --> 02:03:36.704]  Through the fence, Brian?
[02:03:37.164 --> 02:03:40.985]  You might have to die it for like 10 years before you can sneak through a fence.
[02:03:43.168 --> 02:03:44.269]  Don't you worry about that, Owen.
[02:03:44.990 --> 02:03:45.670]  I'll suck it in.
[02:03:46.571 --> 02:03:52.117]  Actually, if you look at me from the side, I'm very wide when you look at me from the front, but from the side, I'm actually very thin.
[02:03:52.597 --> 02:03:53.138]  Like paper.
[02:03:53.578 --> 02:03:54.799]  Because I'm really just a thin man.
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:01.125]  So from the side, you can see how physically large I am, but from the side, you see how thin my intellect really is.
[02:04:01.165 --> 02:04:02.366]  So here's the deal, Mr. President.
[02:04:03.246 --> 02:04:05.648]  You can try to avoid us, but we will find you!
[02:04:06.648 --> 02:04:11.111]  We've got hounds like Jim Acosta right now searching the White House for you.
[02:04:11.751 --> 02:04:16.554]  Oh, by the way, Mr. President, I came in to the egg roll.
[02:04:16.655 --> 02:04:17.315]  You didn't see me.
[02:04:17.355 --> 02:04:18.055]  I was disguised.
[02:04:18.095 --> 02:04:19.596]  I was actually in an Easter Bunny outfit.
[02:04:20.217 --> 02:04:21.378]  But I came into the egg roll.
[02:04:21.798 --> 02:04:26.221]  I know what you did to those eggs, Mr. President, because I tested them on myself.
[02:04:27.241 --> 02:04:28.842]  And so I know what you did, Mr. President.
[02:04:28.882 --> 02:04:29.262]  It's sick.
[02:04:30.263 --> 02:04:31.204]  Uh, Brian.
[02:04:32.313 --> 02:04:33.414]  What are you talking about?
[02:04:35.615 --> 02:04:43.521]  Well, let's just say, uh, I was experimenting with those eggs, but actually now I'm realizing, uh, I'm realizing that I didn't have it right.
[02:04:44.381 --> 02:04:48.024]  And, uh, I think I need to, uh, I think I'm going to have to call you back now.
[02:04:48.064 --> 02:04:49.065]  I'm having a bit of a problem.
[02:04:49.845 --> 02:04:50.506]  Okay, Brian.
[02:04:50.886 --> 02:04:56.610]  I'm not sure what Brian did with those Easter eggs, but hopefully he gets well before his big broadcast this Sunday.
[02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:59.572]  Reliable sources that nobody has watched forever.
[02:05:04.718 --> 02:05:11.461]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[02:05:12.081 --> 02:05:14.623]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[02:05:15.143 --> 02:05:16.083]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[02:05:16.764 --> 02:05:18.965]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:20.445]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:05:20.946 --> 02:05:26.969]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[02:05:27.429 --> 02:05:29.330]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[02:05:29.910 --> 02:05:30.611]  I'm not the leader.
[02:05:30.911 --> 02:05:31.532]  You are the leader.
[02:05:31.692 --> 02:05:33.313]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:05:33.693 --> 02:05:38.438]  We've got giant specials running right now at fullworkstore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:05:39.098 --> 02:05:46.585]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:05:46.845 --> 02:05:47.886]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[02:05:48.266 --> 02:05:49.147]  I want to encourage you again.
[02:05:49.888 --> 02:05:54.334]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[02:05:54.575 --> 02:05:57.359]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[02:05:57.739 --> 02:05:59.622]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[02:05:59.642 --> 02:06:00.303]  God bless you.
[02:06:14.264 --> 02:06:15.685]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:15.945 --> 02:06:17.106]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:17.666 --> 02:06:19.067]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.607 --> 02:06:22.628]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:26.831 --> 02:06:36.796]  Folks, your support at Infowarsstore.com is so important because we give a platform to people like American Identity Movement
[02:06:38.354 --> 02:06:42.256]  Where they would normally just be totally, probably ignored by media.
[02:06:42.316 --> 02:06:57.304]  But luckily, and they hate this, but InfoWars has become so big now, the power of this audience is so real, that we can give a platform to people like Patrick Casey from American Identity Movement and really help put their work on the map.
[02:06:57.364 --> 02:07:01.726]  But it's your support at InfoWarsStore.com that makes this possible.
[02:07:03.187 --> 02:07:05.608]  And so, we don't want the censorship
[02:07:06.806 --> 02:07:13.541]  To then create this other chilling effect that InfoWars has had, which is using the power of this audience and this platform to...
[02:07:15.248 --> 02:07:24.711]  Give life to other outlets, other voices, other commentators, where other media outlets wouldn't give them that opportunity.
[02:07:24.771 --> 02:07:35.734]  So I really appreciate the fact here at InfoWars that we lift the ships around us up, that we try to build up the fleet here.
[02:07:36.074 --> 02:07:38.594]  And so that's why they want to censor us.
[02:07:38.614 --> 02:07:40.435]  So it's not only the information that's powerful,
[02:07:41.588 --> 02:07:44.469]  And Rob Dew just put out a picture on Twitter of Alex in D.C.
[02:07:44.509 --> 02:07:47.769]  today with just a large contingent of young kids.
[02:07:48.210 --> 02:07:50.170]  They hate how powerful our information is.
[02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:52.210]  They hate the impact we're having on the youth.
[02:07:52.471 --> 02:08:02.713]  But they also hate the fact that this is a platform that reaches millions and millions of people every day and we can lift the other ships around us and then build a fleet.
[02:08:03.613 --> 02:08:04.314]  Of course.
[02:08:20.186 --> 02:08:21.727]  InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:08:22.127 --> 02:08:25.429]  So my next guest is Patrick Casey from AmericanIdentityMovement.com.
[02:08:25.709 --> 02:08:38.737]  We featured his video yesterday here on the Alex Jones Show, where he and his partner over at American Identity Movement dressed up as clowns and they went to Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:08:39.297 --> 02:08:42.779]  And so, of course, they got kicked out because they didn't want to play with the kids.
[02:08:43.519 --> 02:08:45.781]  But we're going to talk about that now with Patrick Casey.
[02:08:45.801 --> 02:08:47.501]  So first, Patrick, thanks for joining us.
[02:08:48.623 --> 02:08:54.085]  Made you think of this idea to go to the Drag Queen Story Time dressed as a clown.
[02:08:55.905 --> 02:08:59.306]  So first off, minor correction, I actually wasn't able to attend this.
[02:08:59.406 --> 02:09:12.771]  These were two activists who attended in Louisiana, you know, locals who live in New Orleans, but they did give me the rundown of what exactly they did, what it was like from their perspective, and I did have somewhat of a role in planning, you know, helping to plan this out.
[02:09:12.932 --> 02:09:14.872]  Okay, I apologize for that misinformation.
[02:09:15.292 --> 02:09:22.295]  So basically, these were locals in New Orleans that just work with you guys at American Identity Movement, which you head.
[02:09:22.335 --> 02:09:23.356]  Yeah, they're members of the organization.
[02:09:24.776 --> 02:09:27.339]  They've done quite a bit in the past as well.
[02:09:35.945 --> 02:09:43.072]  Yeah, so basically within the organization, if one of our activists wants to do activism for American Identity Movement, there's a whole process they have to go through.
[02:09:43.092 --> 02:09:44.193]  They have to fill out a proposal.
[02:09:44.213 --> 02:09:46.234]  It has to get approved by our activism department.
[02:09:46.695 --> 02:09:54.742]  We have things very structured and centralized so that people don't go off and do something totally outlandish and then expect us to promote it for American Identity Movement.
[02:09:54.802 --> 02:09:57.565]  So, it's something that was kind of in the works for a little while.
[02:09:57.805 --> 02:09:59.827]  The organization helped provide funds for
[02:10:00.608 --> 02:10:01.369]  We're good to go!
[02:10:12.219 --> 02:10:19.141]  Yeah, and it was powerful, and this is the kind of stuff, and I don't know if you heard the segment from yesterday, but this is the kind of stuff that we have to do now.
[02:10:19.861 --> 02:10:25.322]  And I understand there's some conservatives that don't like this tact, and I get it, but this is what we have to do.
[02:10:25.362 --> 02:10:27.543]  I mean, it's the old cliche, fighting fire with fire.
[02:10:27.723 --> 02:10:31.104]  It's absolute insanity that Drag Queen Story Hour even exists.
[02:10:31.564 --> 02:10:32.664]  I'm not against drag queens.
[02:10:32.824 --> 02:10:33.945]  I'm not against transsexuals.
[02:10:34.605 --> 02:10:36.685]  I just don't understand the purpose of having them read to kids.
[02:10:36.705 --> 02:10:37.586]  Like, what is this all about?
[02:10:37.646 --> 02:10:39.026]  And they say, oh, we're grooming them.
[02:10:39.266 --> 02:10:39.606]  Absolutely, yeah.
[02:11:04.281 --> 02:11:14.686]  Trackling Story Hour is just so absurd that we thought that going in there and trying to outdo them in terms of absurdity was a good way to draw attention to just how ridiculous it was.
[02:11:15.206 --> 02:11:30.314]  And I think for most people right of center kind of understand that a man who wants to dress up as a woman, kind of in an over-sexualized way, might not be totally right in the head, but you know, there are always going to be people who are a little, you know, eccentric and off-center, I guess you could say.
[02:11:30.914 --> 02:11:34.917]  In the past, people like that understand they need to keep that stuff to themselves, right?
[02:11:35.077 --> 02:11:37.198]  You're a man, you want to dress up as a woman?
[02:11:37.218 --> 02:11:39.739]  Well, maybe you should just do it in your house if you're going to do it at all.
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:45.563]  But now what's happened is that deviancy has been weaponized by the left, and it's being shoved in our faces.
[02:11:46.103 --> 02:11:52.947]  And now there used to be people who did this in the past understood, yeah, this isn't something right, so I should do it, I guess, away from the public light.
[02:11:53.308 --> 02:11:58.291]  But now what they've done is they've shoved it in our faces, and they've said, no, you're the sick one if you don't accept it.
[02:11:58.411 --> 02:12:00.312]  So it's not kids that are asking
[02:12:00.762 --> 02:12:02.742]  For Drag Queen Story Hour, right?
[02:12:03.003 --> 02:12:08.384]  It's left-wing liberal parents who are subjecting their kids to left-wing indoctrination.
[02:12:08.404 --> 02:12:13.485]  You know, telling them that drag queens are good, you know, right-wing conservatives, nationalists, they're bad.
[02:12:14.005 --> 02:12:15.845]  And it's really just a sick state of affairs.
[02:12:15.885 --> 02:12:24.928]  And I think that most normal, well-adjusted people are capable of looking at the kind of clips that you're showing right now and seeing that this isn't right.
[02:12:24.968 --> 02:12:26.648]  This isn't the kind of thing that you show to kids.
[02:12:27.435 --> 02:12:36.177]  It's pretty shocking, and I don't think it's a coincidence or an isolated incident, and we in fact know it's not now, that you have pedophiles infiltrating these groups.
[02:12:36.217 --> 02:12:49.981]  I mean, it's really easy, you know, to put on a wig or a mask or what have you, paint your face and all this stuff, change your identity, and all of a sudden people can't go back and look at who you are in the past when you have child sex offenses and other such stuff.
[02:12:50.021 --> 02:12:54.562]  So this has already happened just twice, too, in the Houston Drag Queen story time alone.
[02:12:55.242 --> 02:13:13.714]  And by the way, just to kind of highlight the absurdity of all this, not to go down this path, but I'm following a story right here in Texas where a father is going through a tough divorce deal with his wife and he's not even like, he's being basically told he's the bad person because he doesn't want his four-year-old boy to be a girl.
[02:13:14.255 --> 02:13:16.116]  And his four-year-old boy doesn't want anything to do with this.
[02:13:16.416 --> 02:13:18.678]  It's the ex-wife, but it's like, that's like what you're saying.
[02:13:18.698 --> 02:13:21.900]  It's even reaching the court system now too, where the court's like, oh, you're bad.
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:23.201]  You want your boy to be a boy.
[02:13:23.221 --> 02:13:25.022]  And so, but that's my point is that
[02:13:25.842 --> 02:13:30.923]  Look, to the average consumer of politics and current news, they don't see the craziness.
[02:13:30.943 --> 02:13:32.843]  They don't see the drag queen story times.
[02:13:33.163 --> 02:13:35.624]  They don't see the Trump protesters screaming at the sky.
[02:13:36.624 --> 02:13:39.084]  So we have to bring this to their attention somehow.
[02:13:39.524 --> 02:13:43.625]  So yeah, I feel that it makes sense to fight the absurd with the absurd.
[02:13:43.645 --> 02:13:46.706]  I mean, I do the same here with some of the stunts I do at InForce.
[02:13:46.726 --> 02:13:54.347]  But yeah, it's like you said, the video and the work that these guys did may have not even picked up or noticed by anyone if they didn't put on the clown outfits.
[02:13:55.842 --> 02:13:56.842]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:13:56.882 --> 02:14:05.346]  And we've noticed that the more theatrical in action that we do, we're going to get more positive reception, but also more negative reception.
[02:14:05.626 --> 02:14:07.186]  Oh my gosh.
[02:14:07.566 --> 02:14:11.188]  You've got these hairy men dressed up as clowns.
[02:14:11.208 --> 02:14:12.688]  I mean, they're dressed up as clowns.
[02:14:12.708 --> 02:14:13.729]  They're not trying to be women.
[02:14:13.989 --> 02:14:18.050]  Some of them look like demons.
[02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:19.951]  This is not a cross-dresser.
[02:14:19.971 --> 02:14:20.971]  This is not a drag queen.
[02:14:21.051 --> 02:14:23.572]  I mean, this is not a man trying to be a woman.
[02:14:23.592 --> 02:14:24.993]  I don't know what this is.
[02:14:26.001 --> 02:14:28.083]  Yeah, it's something and it's something.
[02:14:28.726 --> 02:14:36.932]  Kids shouldn't be around, but something that I wanted to point out at some point during this interview is that there is a degree of centralization to Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:14:37.593 --> 02:14:46.499]  I think to some extent it is something that's kind of happening maybe at the grassroots level, but there is a Drag Queen Story Hour, a DQSH non-profit.
[02:14:46.519 --> 02:14:50.282]  It was started in San Francisco by Michelle T and Radar Productions.
[02:14:50.342 --> 02:14:57.007]  I haven't looked into Radar Productions, but who knows what would come up if you did, but basically they have on their website bragging about how they have
[02:14:57.367 --> 02:14:59.529]  Drag Queen Story Hour chapters all over the world.
[02:14:59.589 --> 02:15:02.832]  So there is a non-profit that is organizing these things globally.
[02:15:03.332 --> 02:15:10.098]  And I think, you know, for maybe some of your journalists or other journalists on the dissident right, it would be worthwhile to look into who is funding them.
[02:15:10.538 --> 02:15:17.524]  Yeah, yeah, go ahead and name those organizations again that are starting this Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:15:18.124 --> 02:15:24.570]  Yes, Drag Queen Story Hour is the non-profit and it says on its website it was founded by Michelle T. and Radar Productions.
[02:15:26.527 --> 02:15:32.449]  Well, I know that not only will our team of writers, I'm sure, be looking into that and filing a report.
[02:15:32.589 --> 02:15:35.591]  I'm sure that the audience will be looking into that as well.
[02:15:36.171 --> 02:15:41.072]  But again, I mean, I can't even believe that they used that picture for their front page.
[02:15:41.092 --> 02:15:41.593]  I mean, look at this.
[02:15:42.233 --> 02:15:43.853]  It's clearly a dude.
[02:15:43.873 --> 02:15:46.934]  I mean, masculine features.
[02:15:47.595 --> 02:15:49.295]  It doesn't even appear they're trying to be a woman.
[02:15:49.335 --> 02:15:50.856]  They just do the cross-dressing thing.
[02:15:51.969 --> 02:15:56.821]  And then you see the kid with clearly the leftist indoctrinated parent forcing it on him.
[02:15:56.841 --> 02:15:58.586]  And the kid just is like, what am I looking at?
[02:15:58.626 --> 02:15:59.388]  Is this like a demon?
[02:15:59.408 --> 02:16:00.931]  I mean, the kid actually has instincts.
[02:16:04.719 --> 02:16:06.820]  Brian in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:16:06.940 --> 02:16:13.261]  Yeah, so real quickly, you know, I own the Alexa Pure Pro because I love my neighbor, but I refuse to drink their heart medication.
[02:16:13.301 --> 02:16:15.682]  Well water is some of the most polluted stuff in the country.
[02:16:15.702 --> 02:16:21.043]  Because you got glyphosate, you got all your neighbor's medications that they're putting into a septic tank.
[02:16:21.203 --> 02:16:23.284]  That then goes into the groundwater and you drink it.
[02:16:23.344 --> 02:16:25.644]  So absolutely, the number one thing anybody can do.
[02:16:25.905 --> 02:16:27.305]  And by the way, I forget to do this and get mad.
[02:16:27.765 --> 02:16:31.567]  When I drink filtered water, when I take the supplements, my life's so much better.
[02:16:31.908 --> 02:16:36.090]  When I forget, because I'm not Mr. Frickin' Health, I feel it.
[02:16:36.270 --> 02:16:39.392]  So yes, tell me about not wanting to drink your neighbor's heart medication.
[02:16:39.452 --> 02:16:51.860]  Well, where I live, and I think this is the same story for most of the country, our water filtration is based on a reverse osmosis system that was constructed around the turn of the century, and I have zero, zero faith
[02:16:54.001 --> 02:16:58.342]  Well, look at Flint, Michigan.
[02:16:58.522 --> 02:17:02.384]  Their water is full of lead, mercury, poisons, E. coli.
[02:17:02.664 --> 02:17:06.405]  The answer is, everyone, if you're drinking water, you should filter it.
[02:17:06.565 --> 02:17:07.726]  And I'll never forget David Hogg.
[02:17:08.206 --> 02:17:11.347]  He goes, you know Alex Jones on C-SPAN, he goes, little anti-gun guy.
[02:17:11.507 --> 02:17:16.248]  He goes, he says the water has toxins and then he sells a water filter.
[02:17:16.428 --> 02:17:24.510]  Yeah, it's like saying your kids need vitamin C and then I sell vitamin C. Or, Jones says we need to wear shoes.
[02:17:24.730 --> 02:17:25.730]  We walk in the snow.
[02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:27.370]  Then he advertises shoes.
[02:17:27.570 --> 02:17:28.470]  Yes, exactly.
[02:17:28.791 --> 02:17:30.211]  But see, in his little brain...
[02:17:30.831 --> 02:17:32.272]  Where everything is a scam.
[02:17:32.773 --> 02:17:35.595]  He thinks I'm scamming people when it's a direct sale.
[02:17:35.735 --> 02:17:37.336]  We have the best gravity-fed systems.
[02:17:37.396 --> 02:17:39.998]  Alexa Pure and Pro Pure are apples and oranges, but they're both excellent.
[02:17:40.179 --> 02:17:40.999]  Everyone needs it.
[02:17:41.179 --> 02:17:42.400]  Everyone should filter their water.
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:43.802]  This is the smartest thing you can do.
[02:17:43.822 --> 02:17:47.685]  It doesn't mean occasionally you don't drink some ice tea at a restaurant, but you need to filter your water.
[02:17:47.825 --> 02:17:49.246]  Your skin is your biggest organ.
[02:17:49.306 --> 02:17:50.307]  You absorb it there.
[02:17:50.487 --> 02:17:53.089]  You need filters on your shower or your bath.
[02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:54.130]  Exactly.
[02:17:54.250 --> 02:17:56.032]  And then you look at what's in the water table.
[02:17:56.192 --> 02:17:57.273]  It's insane!
[02:18:02.659 --> 02:18:05.820]  Brain Force Plus is a top-tier nootropin.
[02:18:06.561 --> 02:18:07.021]  Focus.
[02:18:07.761 --> 02:18:08.302]  Clarity.
[02:18:08.742 --> 02:18:09.082]  Energy.
[02:18:09.662 --> 02:18:14.084]  But instead of having a 7x markup, we have a 150% markup.
[02:18:15.125 --> 02:18:17.306]  Right now, it's massively discounted.
[02:18:18.246 --> 02:18:24.228]  And when you get a bottle of it at 25% off, you get a free bottle of what is our total bestseller.
[02:18:24.588 --> 02:18:28.449]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[02:18:28.689 --> 02:18:31.030]  And that, of course, is Knockout, the ultimate sleep aid.
[02:18:31.350 --> 02:18:37.612]  So we've got a way to energize you, ramp you up in a healthy way during the day, and put you deep into that restful, healthy sleep at night.
[02:18:38.112 --> 02:18:41.253]  It's the BrainForce and Knockout combo deal.

[02:19:06.269 --> 02:19:10.193]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[02:19:10.633 --> 02:19:12.434]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:19:12.555 --> 02:19:13.275]  Good to talk to you.
[02:19:13.595 --> 02:19:17.759]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[02:19:17.999 --> 02:19:19.721]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[02:19:19.841 --> 02:19:24.205]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[02:19:24.425 --> 02:19:26.346]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[02:19:26.406 --> 02:19:30.750]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[02:19:30.830 --> 02:19:32.312]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:19:32.352 --> 02:19:32.852]  Tell us about it.
[02:19:32.912 --> 02:19:33.612]  Well, it's really great.
[02:19:33.633 --> 02:19:34.833]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[02:19:34.873 --> 02:19:35.314]  I take it.
[02:19:35.374 --> 02:19:35.994]  It tastes good.
[02:19:36.054 --> 02:19:37.755]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:19:37.815 --> 02:19:39.517]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[02:19:39.657 --> 02:19:42.138]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[02:19:42.158 --> 02:19:42.939]  So I really like it.
[02:19:42.979 --> 02:19:45.661]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[02:19:45.701 --> 02:19:47.242]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[02:19:47.362 --> 02:19:49.203]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[02:19:49.343 --> 02:19:49.824]  So, yeah.
[02:19:50.204 --> 02:19:52.045]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[02:19:52.505 --> 02:19:54.847]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[02:19:55.207 --> 02:19:56.128]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[02:19:56.288 --> 02:19:58.029]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:20:06.286 --> 02:20:08.989]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.255 --> 02:20:31.130]  You know, Alex Jones figured something out a while back that has really been a key to InfoWars' success.
[02:20:32.816 --> 02:20:54.241]  And it's something that I've kind of discovered myself, and it's what Patrick Casey was alluding to in the last segment, how a certain level of absurdity or a certain level of theatrics, as Patrick said, is necessary to garner attention to some of the things that you're doing.
[02:20:54.281 --> 02:20:55.661]  Otherwise, they just kind of fall flat.
[02:20:55.801 --> 02:21:02.023]  And again, I understand why, you know, conservatives look at this stuff and they say, oh, this gives a bad name to us or this that other thing.
[02:21:03.189 --> 02:21:04.190]  This is an info war.
[02:21:04.210 --> 02:21:05.471]  I mean, this is a spiritual battle.
[02:21:06.452 --> 02:21:07.512]  Look at what the left is doing.
[02:21:07.532 --> 02:21:15.098]  Look at the desperate measures the left is taking to try to win for their agenda, which is anti-human, anti-American.
[02:21:15.118 --> 02:21:17.160]  So, I mean, we've got to fight fire with fire.
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:20.182]  So a certain level of us has to realize you have to fight absurdity with absurdity.
[02:21:20.502 --> 02:21:25.366]  How do you show and highlight and mirror the absurdity of Drag Queen Story Hour?
[02:21:25.766 --> 02:21:28.128]  Well, you dress like a clown and you go to Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:21:28.529 --> 02:21:38.258]  But, you know, don't you think it really highlights, Patrick, the intentions here or that even they kind of understand that what they're doing is a little sordid, that they kicked the clowns out?
[02:21:38.638 --> 02:21:40.220]  I mean, why can't the clowns stay?
[02:21:42.281 --> 02:21:42.542]  Right.
[02:21:42.582 --> 02:21:50.249]  Well, I guess they felt that the clowns were being, you know, bad right-wingers for drawing attention, you know, bad right-wing clowns for drawing attention to
[02:21:51.036 --> 02:21:51.397]  I don't
[02:22:11.385 --> 02:22:11.685]  I don't
[02:22:31.673 --> 02:22:31.753]  I'm
[02:22:51.564 --> 02:22:52.725]  You're trying to make it virtue.
[02:23:12.043 --> 02:23:14.447]  The same principle applies for these people in abortion.
[02:23:14.487 --> 02:23:15.608]  How far can we take abortion?
[02:23:15.689 --> 02:23:17.511]  I mean, can we kill a live baby?
[02:23:17.591 --> 02:23:18.613]  Can we abort a one-year-old?
[02:23:18.653 --> 02:23:20.476]  I mean, they'll keep pushing it as far as we'll let them.
[02:23:20.936 --> 02:23:22.318]  So, here's my prediction.
[02:23:23.294 --> 02:23:29.298]  They're going to eventually bring Drag Queen Story Time to public schools and they're going to bring it to kindergarten, first grade classrooms.
[02:23:29.459 --> 02:23:30.239]  That's where this is going.
[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:33.962]  Unless there's a massive pushback.
[02:23:34.302 --> 02:23:34.963]  And that's the key.
[02:23:35.663 --> 02:23:41.307]  If they can continue to push this and there's not a big pushback and they can continue to do Drag Queen Story Hour and let's say...
[02:23:42.288 --> 02:23:48.390]  I would say if they have a success rate, let's give it a number, of I would say either 6 out of 10 or 7 out of 10.
[02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:55.331]  If they have 10 Drag Queen Storytime events and 7 of them are successful and only 3 of them have a pushback, they'll move it next level.
[02:23:55.911 --> 02:24:02.313]  If they have 10 Drag Queen Storytime events and 5 or 6 of them have a protest or get disrupted, they'll realize
[02:24:02.913 --> 02:24:06.436]  Okay, this isn't going to go any farther than this, and they'll start to ratchet it back.
[02:24:06.816 --> 02:24:08.517]  And so I think that's where we're at right now.
[02:24:08.717 --> 02:24:16.663]  And I would even say, maybe it's time to go next level, and you actually pretend to be a drag queen, and see what kind of stuff that you can find out.
[02:24:16.783 --> 02:24:20.966]  Or even when it's your turn, be like, you know kids, this is actually wrong what we're doing here.
[02:24:22.147 --> 02:24:24.889]  You shouldn't be forced to be sexualized.
[02:24:24.909 --> 02:24:28.992]  But that's what I'm saying, that's the battlefront that we're on right now.
[02:24:30.620 --> 02:24:33.302]  Absolutely, and I like the idea of posing as a drag queen.
[02:24:33.342 --> 02:24:35.143]  I don't know if that's something I will ever do.
[02:24:35.163 --> 02:24:36.444]  Yeah, that's the thing.
[02:24:36.524 --> 02:24:36.984]  I don't know.
[02:24:37.124 --> 02:24:39.486]  I'll dress up as a cow.
[02:24:39.586 --> 02:24:41.607]  Yeah, yeah, that's a crowder thing.
[02:24:41.667 --> 02:24:42.868]  That's a crowder thing, I agree.
[02:24:43.369 --> 02:24:44.369]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:49.413]  Activism works, the left understands that, and it's time that the right begins to understand that as well.
[02:24:49.953 --> 02:24:54.056]  And, you know, just regular people, you don't need to have a lot of experience to do activism like this.
[02:24:54.376 --> 02:24:57.238]  If you, if you, if in your city or your town,
[02:24:57.841 --> 02:25:08.307]  If you're aware of Drag Queen Story Hour happening, or being about to happen, then you should get together with like-minded people, like-minded conservatives, nationalists, libertarians, whatever, and just go in there.
[02:25:08.587 --> 02:25:10.629]  And, you know, you don't even have to dress up as clowns.
[02:25:11.029 --> 02:25:21.975]  If you outnumber them, obviously this is peaceful and non-violent, but if you outnumber them, they're going to be able to, you know, you know, maybe chant like some kind of slogan, or you're just going to be able to, you know, say something else.
[02:25:22.195 --> 02:25:23.976]  And these people are self-conscious.
[02:25:24.016 --> 02:25:24.797]  These people are
[02:25:27.359 --> 02:25:31.063]  Absolutely.
[02:25:31.123 --> 02:25:33.185]  In fact, the crew is rolling this B-roll right now.
[02:25:33.345 --> 02:25:44.376]  I went to a Planned Parenthood rally here and I got assaulted by a drag queen or a crossdresser or a transsexual and I realized something because I've reached a point now, Patrick, where
[02:25:45.588 --> 02:25:48.769]  I'm just pressing charges and trying to get anybody arrested who assaults me.
[02:25:49.009 --> 02:25:50.130]  I dealt with it long enough now.
[02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:53.831]  I'm just doing it, and I hate to do that to the police, but it has to be done.
[02:25:54.332 --> 02:25:59.113]  And so I realize, though, I can't even ID my assaulter because they're wearing all this makeup.
[02:25:59.173 --> 02:25:59.914]  I don't know who they are.
[02:25:59.954 --> 02:26:01.094]  They got a wig on and all this crap.
[02:26:01.114 --> 02:26:01.874]  You can't even ID them.
[02:26:02.094 --> 02:26:07.397]  And, of course, that's why these pedophiles are taking advantage of this Drag Queen story time, because they can go in undercover.
[02:26:07.417 --> 02:26:08.197]  But, you know, here's the thing, too.
[02:26:08.919 --> 02:26:11.964]  If you don't want to dress up like a clown and do it, you know, that's fine.
[02:26:12.044 --> 02:26:12.866]  It's not for everybody.
[02:26:13.266 --> 02:26:15.991]  Go print a big poster.
[02:26:16.011 --> 02:26:18.916]  Pull up that psycho freeze frame that we have.
[02:26:19.758 --> 02:26:27.100]  You just print a big poster of an image from Drag Queen Storytime and just stand outside the library and be like, yeah.
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:32.061]  You just print that image right there and just hold it outside the library and say, Drag Queen Storytime is here.
[02:26:32.381 --> 02:26:35.121]  And people's eyes will be like, what is that?
[02:26:35.701 --> 02:26:37.022]  What is going on here?
[02:26:37.562 --> 02:26:40.342]  So, I mean, there's other ways that you can fight this.
[02:26:40.362 --> 02:26:42.563]  And they just pulled up another story about how one was canceled.
[02:26:42.803 --> 02:26:48.864]  But I just feel like if they continue to roll this out with success, it's going to eventually be in the schools and then it's going to be on cable television.
[02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:54.621]  Yeah, we have to push back and that applies to any front on the culture war.
[02:26:54.681 --> 02:27:00.443]  Any issue where the left is trying to, you know, assert its hegemony over us, we need to push back.
[02:27:00.503 --> 02:27:03.063]  We don't want to give them an inch because obviously they will take a mile.
[02:27:03.143 --> 02:27:11.105]  But, you know, one thing that's worth pointing out here is, and I know you touched on this yesterday, is that, you know, this isn't just conservative fear-mongering, right?
[02:27:11.646 --> 02:27:15.206]  As directly in the story, however, it hasn't been going on for that long, I think just like a few years.
[02:27:15.287 --> 02:27:16.307]  But guess what?
[02:27:16.487 --> 02:27:17.047]  Multiple
[02:27:17.631 --> 02:27:21.095]  Drag queens have been revealed to be sex offenders, right?
[02:27:21.355 --> 02:27:24.599]  And I'm sure this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:27:24.619 --> 02:27:29.384]  I'm sure that if you were to look into the backgrounds of all of these drag queens, you would find quite a bit.
[02:27:29.404 --> 02:27:34.109]  So that's another thing for the internet sleuths and journalists to look into.
[02:27:34.209 --> 02:27:39.615]  So the one most egregious example of this is 32-year-old Alberto Garza.
[02:27:40.166 --> 02:27:43.208]  Uh, who sexually assaulted an eight-year-old boy, uh, years ago.
[02:27:43.368 --> 02:27:44.729]  So, registered sex offender.
[02:27:44.969 --> 02:27:45.330]  Guess what?
[02:27:45.370 --> 02:27:49.993]  He gets invited into a li- uh, the Houston Public Library to be around kids.
[02:27:50.513 --> 02:27:55.116]  And it turned into this big m- you know, this big media outrage as it- as it, you know, rightfully should've.
[02:27:55.696 --> 02:27:59.519]  And, uh, you know, it turns out that the library didn't do a background check.
[02:27:59.539 --> 02:28:07.764]  They didn't do any, you know, they didn't do any- Well, or it could be a situation, too, where, you know, the library's relying on the Drag Queen Storytime to do a background check.
[02:28:08.085 --> 02:28:08.665]  Oh, go figure.
[02:28:08.705 --> 02:28:09.786]  They let a pedophile slip in.
[02:28:10.906 --> 02:28:11.447]  Right, right.
[02:28:11.467 --> 02:28:17.909]  I would not trust the Drag Queen Story Hour national non-profit to assert any kind of standard.
[02:28:17.929 --> 02:28:20.731]  Let me just ask you this final question, Patrick, as this segment comes to a close.
[02:28:20.751 --> 02:28:22.972]  I mean, and this is why the activism is so important.
[02:28:23.492 --> 02:28:31.956]  My guess is, and this is probably your most viewed video ever, my guess is when your activists dressed up as clowns to do this, they did not expect it would get this attention and would end up on InfoWars.
[02:28:31.996 --> 02:28:34.577]  They did it because they wanted to be activists, and that's why this is so key.
[02:28:36.002 --> 02:28:36.442]  Absolutely.
[02:28:36.542 --> 02:28:40.984]  They did a phenomenal job and they deserve unending praise for this fantastic action.
[02:28:41.844 --> 02:28:42.804]  So there it is, folks.
[02:28:42.884 --> 02:28:48.206]  The video can be found on American Identity Movement's Twitter, the original right there.
[02:28:48.766 --> 02:28:56.109]  And hey, if you feel like taking action and engaging in activism to stop Drag Queen Story Hour from reaching kids in schools, that's where it's going next.
[02:28:56.409 --> 02:28:57.129]  Take action today.
[02:28:57.169 --> 02:29:00.050]  Thank you so much for joining us, Patrick Casey of American Identity Movement.
[02:29:00.933 --> 02:29:02.654]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:22.751]  We're good to go.
[02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:43.640]  Earth changes.
[02:29:43.941 --> 02:29:47.862]  This is talking about a different view of what's happening with climate change.
[02:29:48.002 --> 02:29:53.804]  Much different than the propaganda we hear being pushed by the environmental communities around the world.
[02:29:54.144 --> 02:29:55.525]  Take a look at our books and videos.
[02:29:55.585 --> 02:29:56.705]  Support InfoWars.
[02:29:57.145 --> 02:30:01.947]  This is a way for you to get involved and join us and be one of the warriors with us in changing the world.
[02:30:03.365 --> 02:30:10.130]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:13.272]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[02:30:13.752 --> 02:30:17.595]  But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:30:18.115 --> 02:30:19.076]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:30:19.596 --> 02:30:25.620]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:27.982]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[02:30:28.562 --> 02:30:29.263]  I'm not the leader.
[02:30:29.563 --> 02:30:30.163]  You are the leader.
[02:30:30.384 --> 02:30:31.965]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:30:32.345 --> 02:30:37.089]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:45.196]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:30:45.216 --> 02:30:46.537]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[02:30:46.917 --> 02:30:47.798]  I want to encourage you again.
[02:30:48.319 --> 02:30:52.984]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[02:30:53.225 --> 02:30:55.968]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:58.271]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[02:30:58.511 --> 02:30:58.952]  God bless you.
[02:31:02.601 --> 02:31:09.343]  Both President Obama and Hillary Clinton found it impossible to say the words radical Islam.
[02:31:09.664 --> 02:31:11.324]  Radical Islamic terrorists.
[02:31:12.224 --> 02:31:14.365]  And he won't even mention the word.
[02:31:14.745 --> 02:31:16.266]  And nor will President Obama.
[02:31:16.326 --> 02:31:17.286]  He won't use the term.
[02:31:17.466 --> 02:31:20.147]  Or speak anything negative about Islam.
[02:31:20.247 --> 02:31:27.710]  I consider it part of my responsibility as President of the United States to fight against negative stereotypes of Islam wherever they appear.
[02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:35.433]  And now after the horrible terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, strangely, they cannot seem to use the word Christian.
[02:31:36.294 --> 02:31:47.178]  Obama, Clinton, and ABC News have all used the word Easter Worshipper, as if an anti-Christian PR firm is feeding them all talking points.
[02:31:47.698 --> 02:31:48.218]  Strange.
[02:31:48.679 --> 02:31:53.921]  At this point, it really just seems obvious what side these people are all working for.
[02:32:02.473 --> 02:32:04.413]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:32:04.833 --> 02:32:11.075]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[02:32:11.435 --> 02:32:15.396]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[02:32:15.916 --> 02:32:21.898]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[02:32:22.398 --> 02:32:28.420]  Ultra-purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:40.383]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[02:32:40.863 --> 02:32:50.126]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[02:32:50.706 --> 02:32:54.470]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[02:32:55.031 --> 02:32:59.756]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWars Life at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:06.203 --> 02:33:08.906]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.631 --> 02:33:25.372]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:33:25.873 --> 02:33:33.176]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:33:34.757 --> 02:33:39.999]  So much to get to in the hour and a half that I have left here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:40.459 --> 02:33:46.002]  It's going to be a powerful archive four hours when it's all said and done.
[02:33:46.082 --> 02:33:48.303]  Be sure to share this broadcast with your friends and family folks.
[02:33:48.323 --> 02:33:48.483]  Look,
[02:33:49.909 --> 02:34:13.956]  This is the type of broadcast they don't want people hearing, because most of the stuff we discuss here, the average American is thinking about, or has it in their subconscious, they're just distracted by their own lives, or a football game, or whatever, and so they don't talk about it, it never rises to the surface, until they see it, and they hear it, and they see other people think it, and they see other people talking about it, they see other people are caring about it, and then all of a sudden,
[02:34:15.046 --> 02:34:17.168]  They start to voice their opinion.
[02:34:17.248 --> 02:34:21.431]  They start to feel not so alone out there in the universe.
[02:34:21.971 --> 02:34:23.252]  But they want you to feel alone.
[02:34:23.312 --> 02:34:27.415]  They want those instincts that you've buried down deep to stay there.
[02:34:27.895 --> 02:34:34.420]  Because as soon as they come up to the surface, you're not going to accept this satanic one-world government.
[02:34:34.820 --> 02:34:35.521]  And they know that.
[02:34:35.901 --> 02:34:37.202]  So they have to keep you distracted.
[02:34:38.923 --> 02:34:41.785]  And they have to keep your instincts beaten out of you.
[02:34:42.086 --> 02:34:43.547]  And then they really have to bully you.
[02:34:44.289 --> 02:34:49.015]  Out of your divine curiosity for the universe and for your existence.
[02:34:51.198 --> 02:34:57.045]  But they can't stop us at InfoWars.com and it absolutely drives them crazy.
[02:34:57.606 --> 02:35:00.610]  And your support at InfoWarsStore.com is so imperative right now, folks.
[02:35:00.810 --> 02:35:01.631]  You know, I gotta tell ya...
[02:35:03.044 --> 02:35:17.650]  Um, you know, when I start talking to Alex about expansion here and he starts making announcements about expansion here, um, you know, you start to get your spidey senses tingling because it's, I mean, it's almost a miracle.
[02:35:18.831 --> 02:35:23.693]  In fact, I mean, it's practically a miracle that we can expand in the middle of all this censorship.
[02:35:23.733 --> 02:35:31.576]  I mean, first of all, for example, I mean, you can just look at TV and if you go and look, the average television show
[02:35:32.748 --> 02:35:35.570]  Maybe last a season or two and never gets re-signed.
[02:35:35.730 --> 02:35:36.411]  Because it fails.
[02:35:37.332 --> 02:35:41.355]  It's so hard to successfully launch a new show.
[02:35:41.815 --> 02:35:42.776]  It's almost impossible.
[02:35:43.937 --> 02:35:50.982]  I mean, how many shows have they launched on Comedy Central making fun of Alex Jones and Infowars that fall flat on their face after a couple months?
[02:35:51.282 --> 02:35:51.883]  Almost all of them.
[02:35:52.163 --> 02:35:53.784]  And then they keep bringing the same guy back.
[02:35:54.505 --> 02:35:56.346]  Jordan Klepper has a new thing he's doing now.
[02:35:59.178 --> 02:36:07.002]  We've launched shows, David Knight every morning, with the David Knight Show, and then myself with The War Room in the afternoon drive.
[02:36:07.842 --> 02:36:13.224]  We've been on air now for over a year, almost two years, and we've had massive success.
[02:36:13.244 --> 02:36:25.030]  I mean, that's a miracle in and of itself, that we're able to launch new shows and then have sustained success and viewership despite the fact we're basically banned from being broadcast.
[02:36:27.033 --> 02:36:27.594]  It's a miracle.
[02:36:27.614 --> 02:36:29.916]  And it's all possible with your support at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:36:29.956 --> 02:36:31.277]  I cannot thank you guys enough.
[02:36:32.338 --> 02:36:36.422]  And so take advantage of the t-shirt sale we have going right now.
[02:36:36.442 --> 02:36:38.003]  50% off all apparel.
[02:36:38.023 --> 02:36:39.244]  We've also got some other specials.
[02:36:40.425 --> 02:36:40.666]  In fact,
[02:36:41.633 --> 02:36:45.636]  I'm going to talk about a special we have in the final hour of today's show.
[02:36:45.656 --> 02:36:46.717]  You're not going to want to miss that.
[02:36:47.718 --> 02:36:54.663]  But go to Infowarsstore.com, get yourself an Infowars t-shirt, support the Infowar, become a walking, talking billboard for Infowars.
[02:36:55.083 --> 02:37:06.212]  But look, if you're not going to support us at Infowarsstore.com, just share the links, tell your friends and family, talk about Infowars, don't be bullied out of your free speech, and help us expand.
[02:37:06.972 --> 02:37:11.476]  Because that's Alex's plan right now, is to begin the next expansion.
[02:37:11.536 --> 02:37:14.518]  But it's tough, considering the censorship that we endure.
[02:37:14.538 --> 02:37:17.420]  But with your support at InfoWarsTore.com, it's all possible.
[02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:32.352]  Now, I've got this stack of news here that I want to get to about how the Democrats are basically just trying to measure the rope that they want to use to hang themselves with here in the 2020 presidential campaign process.
[02:37:32.392 --> 02:37:35.255]  But first, here is Tucker Carlson breaking it down last night.
[02:37:36.269 --> 02:37:38.931]  Democrats say they despise Donald Trump.
[02:37:38.991 --> 02:37:39.812]  They seem to mean it.
[02:37:40.352 --> 02:37:43.895]  They tell us they'll do anything to prevent him from continuing as president.
[02:37:44.696 --> 02:37:50.200]  But if that's really true, why are they working so hard to sabotage their own chances of replacing him?
[02:37:50.721 --> 02:37:55.305]  Why are Democrats suddenly saying things that will guarantee Trump's re-election as president?
[02:37:56.232 --> 02:38:03.757]  In just the past few months, Democrats have said things that are so out of the mainstream that it's very hard to imagine voters will back them.
[02:38:04.578 --> 02:38:12.544]  Just last night on CNN, watch Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner, endorse voting for felons who are currently behind bars.
[02:38:12.764 --> 02:38:13.184]  Watch this.
[02:38:15.586 --> 02:38:19.489]  If somebody commits a serious crime, sexual assault, murder,
[02:38:20.353 --> 02:38:21.294]  They're gonna be punished.
[02:38:21.854 --> 02:38:25.456]  They may be in jail for 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, their whole lives.
[02:38:25.756 --> 02:38:28.998]  That's what happens when you commit a serious crime.
[02:38:29.578 --> 02:38:34.220]  But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy.
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:37.162]  Yes, even for terrible people.
[02:38:39.063 --> 02:38:40.083]  Terrible people?
[02:38:40.404 --> 02:38:42.765]  So how terrible is Sanders talking about?
[02:38:42.885 --> 02:38:43.405]  Cannibals?
[02:38:44.085 --> 02:38:45.286]  Convicted spies?
[02:38:46.026 --> 02:38:48.368]  How about terrorists who kill children?
[02:38:49.326 --> 02:38:50.667]  Oh yes, said Barney Sanders.
[02:38:50.687 --> 02:38:51.547]  They get the vote too.
[02:38:52.187 --> 02:38:58.670]  Unlike the first or second... You know, and honestly, I think that this is one of the less extreme things that the Democrats are pushing right now, to be honest.
[02:39:00.391 --> 02:39:05.334]  Who are convicted, in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber, on death row.
[02:39:05.394 --> 02:39:07.295]  People who are convicted of sexual assault.
[02:39:07.315 --> 02:39:08.315]  They should be able to vote?
[02:39:08.875 --> 02:39:10.116]  I think we should have that conversation.
[02:39:13.237 --> 02:39:15.920]  Okay, let's have that conversation.
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:25.448]  Best to do it right now, actually, because whenever the left tells you they want a conversation about something, you can be certain that any dissent on that subject will be banned a year from now.
[02:39:25.969 --> 02:39:33.496]  By 2020, questioning whether imprisoned terrorists should vote will earn you a trip to the HR department and a lifetime ban from PayPal and Twitter.
[02:39:34.196 --> 02:39:39.397]  So, while we still can, consider the story of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
[02:39:39.417 --> 02:39:44.559]  Tsarnaev first came to the United States, you'll remember, on a tourist visa with the rest of his family from Kyrgyzstan.
[02:39:44.959 --> 02:39:46.759]  All of them promptly claimed asylum here.
[02:39:46.799 --> 02:39:47.399]  They were given it.
[02:39:48.260 --> 02:39:53.681]  Over time, the Tsarnaevs collected more than $100,000 in taxpayer finance government benefits.
[02:39:54.121 --> 02:39:56.102]  In 2012, Tsarnaev received U.S.
[02:39:56.162 --> 02:39:56.762]  citizenship.
[02:39:56.842 --> 02:39:57.182]  And then,
[02:39:57.822 --> 02:40:03.961]  Less than a year later, he murdered three people and maimed hundreds with a pressure cooker bomb at the Boston Marathon.
[02:40:03.981 --> 02:40:04.824]  Now he's on death row.
[02:40:05.765 --> 02:40:08.026]  So Democrats hear that story and they feel outrage.
[02:40:08.306 --> 02:40:11.648]  It's not that immigrants repaid our generosity with a terror attack.
[02:40:11.668 --> 02:40:12.648]  That may bother you.
[02:40:12.668 --> 02:40:14.209]  It doesn't bother them.
[02:40:14.869 --> 02:40:20.972]  The injustice they're enraged by is that a convicted terrorist might not be allowed to help pick our next president.
[02:40:21.492 --> 02:40:22.313]  That's outrageous.
[02:40:22.333 --> 02:40:23.313]  No, I think it should go farther.
[02:40:23.333 --> 02:40:26.515]  I think his dead brother, Kamerlin Tsarnaev, should vote too.
[02:40:26.555 --> 02:40:30.797]  Kyrgyzstani refugees like the Tsarnaevs have faced historically in this country.
[02:40:31.037 --> 02:40:32.598]  Maybe they need reparations too.
[02:40:32.618 --> 02:40:33.338]  Give them two votes.
[02:40:33.658 --> 02:40:34.639]  They definitely need a voice.
[02:40:35.663 --> 02:40:37.885]  Sort of the convicts of West Feliciana.
[02:40:37.905 --> 02:40:39.007]  So here's the thing.
[02:40:40.408 --> 02:40:43.572]  I mean, honestly, that's like the least radical thing that the Democrats are doing right now.
[02:40:43.592 --> 02:40:47.096]  I mean, at least felons in this country, which we did the number, it's probably about 6 million.
[02:40:47.116 --> 02:40:48.817]  So yeah, the Democrats need 6 million votes.
[02:40:48.837 --> 02:40:49.598]  That's really what this is.
[02:40:50.578 --> 02:40:53.540]  There's about six million felons that can't vote in this country.
[02:40:54.661 --> 02:40:58.984]  And so the Democrats are, pun not intended, dying for votes right now.
[02:40:59.645 --> 02:41:04.569]  And so, yeah, they want to try to tap into that six million felon voters, is what they want to do.
[02:41:05.229 --> 02:41:09.452]  Or they'll use that to steal six million votes.
[02:41:09.472 --> 02:41:11.474]  I mean, that's really what they'll do.
[02:41:11.514 --> 02:41:13.015]  They'll go, oh yeah, we're giving you the right to vote.
[02:41:13.576 --> 02:41:16.037]  And then they'll just say, you'll just have six million Democrat votes magically.
[02:41:16.077 --> 02:41:17.739]  Like, every felon will vote Democrat, you know?
[02:41:18.279 --> 02:41:19.120]  And so that's what they'll do.
[02:41:20.478 --> 02:41:23.039]  But that's like the least radical thing the Democrats are doing.
[02:41:23.619 --> 02:41:25.080]  The Democrats have dead people voting.
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:29.842]  The Democrats have people voting twice in districts that they don't even live in and haven't lived in for decades.
[02:41:29.862 --> 02:41:30.743]  This has all been exposed.
[02:41:30.763 --> 02:41:36.285]  The Democrats, they bus in ballots at the midnight twilight hour of election night.
[02:41:36.986 --> 02:41:38.686]  They want non-citizens to vote.
[02:41:38.746 --> 02:41:40.647]  They literally want people to come from any country and vote.
[02:41:40.847 --> 02:41:43.369]  Oh, but by the way, did you hear about Russian influence and meddling?
[02:41:43.749 --> 02:41:46.050]  These people are a... You know, that's what I'm saying.
[02:41:46.070 --> 02:41:46.430]  It's just like...
[02:41:48.946 --> 02:41:49.346]  I don't know.
[02:41:50.407 --> 02:41:50.987]  Here's the deal.
[02:41:52.128 --> 02:41:52.628]  Here's the deal.
[02:41:53.289 --> 02:42:03.154]  It's like at this point, we either just take the black pill and just let these people destroy us and destroy our country and destroy the West, or you're literally going to have to start locking these people up.
[02:42:03.174 --> 02:42:07.016]  You don't have to jail them.
[02:42:07.777 --> 02:42:08.957]  Put them in insane asylums.
[02:42:11.239 --> 02:42:17.422]  These people are in a total uproar over Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
[02:42:20.077 --> 02:42:23.582]  Their own people admit, Rosenstein, all of them admit, zero votes were impacted.
[02:42:23.622 --> 02:42:23.922]  Zero!
[02:42:24.443 --> 02:42:25.124]  No votes changed.
[02:42:25.905 --> 02:42:30.492]  But yet, they're sitting here pissing and moaning over Russian collusion and Russian meddling.
[02:42:31.473 --> 02:42:34.077]  Meanwhile, they have a wide open southern border and they won't allow anyone to cross it and vote.
[02:42:35.188 --> 02:42:36.789]  Folks, that's mental illness.
[02:42:36.809 --> 02:42:37.469]  That's insanity.
[02:42:37.489 --> 02:42:38.909]  They belong in an insane asylum.
[02:42:38.929 --> 02:42:54.776]  So we can either decide to wake up as humans, to reach down in our pants and grab our nuts and say, we're not going to be destroyed by you psychos, or go ahead and take the black pill and enjoy the show as they destroy this country and destroy freedom in the West.
[02:42:54.936 --> 02:42:55.596]  That's your choice.
[02:42:56.096 --> 02:43:00.798]  Nut up and take these people to the insane asylum where they belong or enjoy the destruction of America.
[02:43:02.637 --> 02:43:03.941]  I've got a big announcement to make.
[02:43:04.322 --> 02:43:06.368]  We've got four or five positions.

[02:44:02.526 --> 02:44:07.508]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:44:07.728 --> 02:44:15.272]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:44:16.292 --> 02:44:18.873]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:44:19.274 --> 02:44:20.634]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:44:21.014 --> 02:44:27.297]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:44:29.378 --> 02:44:34.281]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[02:44:34.701 --> 02:44:37.623]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:44:37.663 --> 02:44:41.245]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:44:41.265 --> 02:44:45.148]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:44:45.568 --> 02:44:47.269]  I've got two in my home.
[02:44:47.389 --> 02:44:53.013]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:44:53.493 --> 02:44:54.354]  Don't live
[02:44:55.154 --> 02:44:58.858]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[02:44:59.218 --> 02:45:00.479]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:04.119 --> 02:45:08.560]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:13.481]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[02:45:14.081 --> 02:45:19.942]  They said, on average, about maybe a dollar of melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[02:45:20.342 --> 02:45:32.944]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[02:45:33.704 --> 02:45:42.410]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[02:45:42.431 --> 02:45:44.312]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[02:45:44.632 --> 02:45:45.793]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[02:45:45.813 --> 02:45:47.054]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[02:45:47.254 --> 02:45:48.435]  He doesn't drink anything.
[02:45:48.655 --> 02:45:50.115]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[02:45:50.636 --> 02:45:52.236]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[02:45:52.256 --> 02:45:54.037]  I only have to take one knockout.
[02:45:54.397 --> 02:45:56.998]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[02:45:57.038 --> 02:45:57.898]  This is insane.
[02:45:58.298 --> 02:45:59.939]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[02:46:00.179 --> 02:46:02.739]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:04.700]  He says, this is totally free.
[02:46:04.740 --> 02:46:06.581]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[02:46:06.601 --> 02:46:08.441]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[02:46:09.302 --> 02:46:15.243]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[02:46:15.483 --> 02:46:16.824]  All just moderate dose.
[02:46:18.356 --> 02:46:26.343]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[02:46:26.363 --> 02:46:28.766]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:28.806 --> 02:46:29.947]  But thank you for committing.
[02:46:34.011 --> 02:46:36.834]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[02:46:37.214 --> 02:46:39.816]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[02:46:39.836 --> 02:46:44.621]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing millions and then, you know, funding race war.
[02:46:45.081 --> 02:46:51.206]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[02:46:51.226 --> 02:46:54.349]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[02:46:54.689 --> 02:46:55.991]  It's called reap what you sow.
[02:47:05.692 --> 02:47:11.915]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.577 --> 02:47:28.244]  Well, you know... We got another special guest.
[02:47:28.945 --> 02:47:33.087]  He's been on before, but... He's coming back on in the fourth hour.
[02:47:40.180 --> 02:47:41.404]  Oh my gosh, man.
[02:47:43.529 --> 02:47:46.177]  You've got Humpty Dumpty on CNN.
[02:47:47.751 --> 02:47:49.692]  Cheering on destruction of America.
[02:47:50.452 --> 02:47:58.075]  And you've got the Democrats engaging in... Democrats are literally engaging in terrorism and treason.
[02:47:58.115 --> 02:48:02.497]  I mean, you know, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna water down my words.
[02:48:02.637 --> 02:48:03.497]  Let's call it what it is.
[02:48:03.817 --> 02:48:07.939]  The Democrat Party is engaged in terrorism and treason, period.
[02:48:08.459 --> 02:48:08.779]  That's it!
[02:48:08.999 --> 02:48:10.160]  The Democrats are terrorists!
[02:48:12.640 --> 02:48:15.202]  Oh, Owen, you can't say that.
[02:48:15.522 --> 02:48:15.882]  Really?
[02:48:16.463 --> 02:48:17.163]  They said it!
[02:48:17.564 --> 02:48:19.625]  Project Veritas got undercover video!
[02:48:19.765 --> 02:48:25.229]  They had a guy named Aaron Black, whose literally job it was to engage in domestic terror.
[02:48:25.789 --> 02:48:26.450]  And they got caught.
[02:48:26.550 --> 02:48:29.852]  They shut down a Trump event in Chicago with their domestic terror.
[02:48:31.674 --> 02:48:33.135]  What do you think Jussie Smollett is?
[02:48:33.155 --> 02:48:37.498]  What do you think having open borders is?
[02:48:37.518 --> 02:48:40.079]  It's all, it's all treason.
[02:48:40.140 --> 02:48:41.540]  The Democrats are open
[02:48:42.526 --> 02:48:45.068]  Terrorists and treason, I mean, it's unbelievable!
[02:48:45.568 --> 02:48:46.229]  So, look!
[02:48:48.370 --> 02:48:50.572]  Again, it really comes down to this, folks.
[02:48:51.532 --> 02:48:59.958]  Americans can either get real or just enjoy the show.
[02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:04.622]  Because the Democrats are going to destroy this country.
[02:49:06.383 --> 02:49:06.903]  They already are.
[02:49:08.945 --> 02:49:09.765]  The good news is, though,
[02:49:10.663 --> 02:49:15.186]  You know, the left is really confused right now about what bathroom to use.
[02:49:15.686 --> 02:49:17.087]  You know, there's this big bathroom debate.
[02:49:17.127 --> 02:49:19.869]  So the good news is, the Democrats have actually solved this issue.
[02:49:19.889 --> 02:49:20.469]  This is big.
[02:49:21.970 --> 02:49:24.412]  The Democrats have actually solved the bathroom issue.
[02:49:25.613 --> 02:49:28.655]  Just poop in the streets.
[02:49:29.976 --> 02:49:32.017]  So the Democrats have solved the bathroom issue.
[02:49:33.158 --> 02:49:33.998]  Just go in the streets.
[02:49:34.198 --> 02:49:34.899]  Just do it in the road.
[02:49:36.192 --> 02:49:37.353]  That's what they do in San Francisco.
[02:49:37.753 --> 02:49:42.036]  So I credit the Democrats for creating all of these crap jobs.
[02:49:43.117 --> 02:49:44.178]  You really have to give them credit.
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:48.802]  I just can't even believe it, man.
[02:49:50.143 --> 02:49:55.547]  I just can't even believe we're going to have to sit here and watch the destruction of America.
[02:49:55.807 --> 02:50:00.330]  And you know, so many people look at the president as the last hope to stop this.
[02:50:00.551 --> 02:50:02.092]  And he really almost is a man alone.
[02:50:05.117 --> 02:50:07.458]  But, I mean, he needs to know we have his back.
[02:50:07.498 --> 02:50:08.939]  I mean, there needs to be more activism.
[02:50:10.140 --> 02:50:11.440]  These people have to be exposed.
[02:50:11.981 --> 02:50:12.601]  But it's sad.
[02:50:12.721 --> 02:50:15.022]  You know, millions of Americans have no idea what's even going on.
[02:50:15.062 --> 02:50:20.225]  They're following their favorite sports team, or their favorite TV show, or obsessed with the Game of Thrones.
[02:50:22.086 --> 02:50:26.168]  And they'll just wake up one day and walk outside, and America will be dead, and they'll say, what the hell happened?
[02:50:26.448 --> 02:50:32.351]  Well, while you were zombified, while you were in a trance, Democrats destroyed this country.
[02:50:33.787 --> 02:50:42.431]  They opened the borders, we got floods of illegals, they didn't let them vote, so then they voted for whoever would give them free stuff, that then destroyed our economy, and now we have nothing.
[02:50:43.411 --> 02:50:44.772]  Thanks though, I hope you enjoyed the ballgame.
[02:50:48.494 --> 02:50:50.134]  So, I'm just gonna sit here and watch it, folks.
[02:50:51.555 --> 02:51:00.439]  And you know, I've only been here at Infowars for three years, and I've only been doing politics and news for, I guess, about five or six now.
[02:51:02.319 --> 02:51:10.481]  And I just, so many times I just understand Alex's frustration because it's just like, you're just sitting here, it's like watching your kid drown.
[02:51:14.322 --> 02:51:15.762]  Let me get back into this news though.
[02:51:20.683 --> 02:51:27.285]  Now, we've got the new talking point coming out and I, we all said this would happen.
[02:51:28.717 --> 02:51:36.081]  The new talking point coming out against Trump or the Russian collusion narrative to try to breathe new life into it is Don McGahn.
[02:51:36.141 --> 02:51:37.062]  Here's a series of headlines.
[02:51:37.642 --> 02:51:43.686]  White House plans to fight House subpoena of former counsel Don McGahn for testimony on Mueller report.
[02:51:44.846 --> 02:51:45.747]  It's all a bunch of BS.
[02:51:45.847 --> 02:51:47.948]  It's just keeping the story going.
[02:51:48.008 --> 02:51:49.969]  It's just keeping the obstruction going.
[02:51:50.009 --> 02:51:52.851]  It's just trying to keep the boot on America's neck.
[02:51:54.056 --> 02:51:56.277]  They can't let President Trump do his job.
[02:51:56.317 --> 02:52:01.560]  They have to keep him battling this fake collusion narrative all day with lawyers and everything.
[02:52:03.201 --> 02:52:08.624]  Democrats ask Trump, and Trump says no, signaling a bitter fight ahead.
[02:52:08.684 --> 02:52:11.926]  So they're not going to cooperate with this investigation.
[02:52:12.206 --> 02:52:15.267]  And then the Democrats are going to say, oh, see, Trump is obstructing justice.
[02:52:15.287 --> 02:52:15.988]  Trump says, no, no, no.
[02:52:17.153 --> 02:52:18.854]  They're actively engaged in treason.
[02:52:18.894 --> 02:52:23.637]  It's like, if you try to stop treason, you're somehow, you're somehow the bad guy.
[02:52:23.997 --> 02:52:26.718]  Like, if you fight back against, oh, it's like, no, no, no, no.
[02:52:27.859 --> 02:52:29.320]  It's like, you should just be raped.
[02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:31.901]  You should just let the murderer murder you.
[02:52:32.782 --> 02:52:34.162]  Just bend over and take the rape.
[02:52:34.223 --> 02:52:34.883]  Don't fight back.
[02:52:35.483 --> 02:52:36.044]  Oh my gosh!
[02:52:36.364 --> 02:52:37.644]  Did you see that victim of rape?
[02:52:38.425 --> 02:52:40.126]  That victim of rape tried to fight back!
[02:52:42.130 --> 02:52:42.950]  That's a rapist!
[02:52:43.250 --> 02:52:43.791]  It's like, what'd they do?
[02:52:43.971 --> 02:52:44.471]  Oh my gosh!
[02:52:44.631 --> 02:52:46.231]  That person just got murdered!
[02:52:46.632 --> 02:52:48.872]  Tried to stop him, tried to save his own life!
[02:52:48.912 --> 02:52:49.573]  That murderer!
[02:52:50.833 --> 02:52:52.013]  So here's Trump.
[02:52:52.474 --> 02:52:54.334]  These people are openly engaged in treason.
[02:52:55.435 --> 02:52:57.755]  And so he's trying to stop the treason, and they say, look at Trump!
[02:52:57.815 --> 02:52:58.656]  He's committing treason!
[02:53:01.417 --> 02:53:03.497]  Dems clash with Trump officials on subpoenas.
[02:53:03.537 --> 02:53:04.038]  Tax returns.
[02:53:04.098 --> 02:53:05.538]  Oh yeah, get ready, that'll be the next one.
[02:53:05.818 --> 02:53:07.019]  The taxes, the taxes!
[02:53:07.299 --> 02:53:08.779]  Oh, Rachel Maddow found the taxes!
[02:53:08.959 --> 02:53:10.700]  Rachel Maddow can't even do 2 plus 2!
[02:53:14.124 --> 02:53:15.945]  Politico, politico, you people.
[02:53:17.786 --> 02:53:18.466]  This is risky.
[02:53:18.846 --> 02:53:21.407]  Trump's thirst for Mueller revenge could land him in trouble.
[02:53:21.487 --> 02:53:30.992]  Again, here's the Democrats, everybody just openly engaging in treason, Trump trying to stop it, and they say, oh, Trump is trying to stop treason against America?
[02:53:31.672 --> 02:53:32.813]  How dare he?
[02:53:34.453 --> 02:53:38.335]  Oh, that individual tried to stop the assailant from raping her.
[02:53:38.955 --> 02:53:39.876]  She's a rapist.
[02:53:41.400 --> 02:53:45.121]  Did you see that victim that just got stabbed in the throat to death?
[02:53:46.122 --> 02:53:48.422]  That victim tried to stop the stabbing!
[02:53:48.603 --> 02:53:50.623]  They tried to take down their assailant!
[02:53:51.123 --> 02:53:51.984]  That's a murderer!
[02:53:52.644 --> 02:53:53.924]  I'm glad they got killed!
[02:53:54.645 --> 02:53:55.445]  That's their mindset.
[02:53:56.145 --> 02:53:58.106]  But no, that's what they're trying to impart on you.
[02:53:59.046 --> 02:54:00.347]  They want you to be that fooled.
[02:54:00.447 --> 02:54:01.687]  They want you to be that dumb.
[02:54:02.547 --> 02:54:04.068]  And sadly, many Americans are.
[02:54:04.088 --> 02:54:10.010]  Ah, when you got Brian Stelter on TV.
[02:54:11.954 --> 02:54:13.535]  Do you know he was only 33 years old?
[02:54:13.555 --> 02:54:19.920]  Uh, stay away from, uh, doughnuts, kids.
[02:54:21.922 --> 02:54:25.144]  Biden's set to announce presidential run on Thursday in a video.
[02:54:25.285 --> 02:54:28.367]  That shows you how pathetic his presidential campaign is about to be.
[02:54:28.387 --> 02:54:30.008]  He can't even do it live in person.
[02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:35.633]  Oh, crazy Uncle Joe cereal groper Biden.
[02:54:37.182 --> 02:54:37.942]  That's going to be fun.
[02:54:37.983 --> 02:54:42.665]  It's either going to be the presidential race we deserve is Bernie Sanders vs. Trump.
[02:54:43.086 --> 02:54:46.548]  The presidential race that we're probably going to get though is going to be Biden vs. Trump.
[02:54:46.948 --> 02:54:47.788]  And it's going to be beautiful.
[02:54:47.848 --> 02:54:50.430]  So we're not even going to have real, it's not even going to be real crap.
[02:54:50.890 --> 02:54:58.975]  It's going to be here's Joe Biden and all his crimes and all his Ukrainian collusion and by the way he can't keep his hands off of 12 year old girls' chests.
[02:54:59.355 --> 02:55:00.136]  It's disgusting!
[02:55:04.389 --> 02:55:09.553]  Maryland Governor Hogan says he's seriously mauling a presidential run, criticizes Trump's very disturbing behavior.
[02:55:09.573 --> 02:55:13.557]  So you've got all these no-name Democrats now popping into the picture.
[02:55:13.577 --> 02:55:15.699]  There's like 25 that are going to be running now.
[02:55:15.719 --> 02:55:16.539]  They've already set a record.
[02:55:16.579 --> 02:55:17.500]  Who told you that was going to happen?
[02:55:17.560 --> 02:55:18.021]  Infowars.
[02:55:18.461 --> 02:55:23.966]  And then you've got these other weak, chicken-neck Republicans like Bill Weld trying to run against Trump.
[02:55:24.466 --> 02:55:25.687]  Oh Bill, stay home.
[02:55:26.568 --> 02:55:27.829]  Save yourself the embarrassment.
[02:55:30.279 --> 02:55:35.104]  Bernier bust, the Sanders supporters who will back Trump if their man isn't the Democrat nominee.
[02:55:35.684 --> 02:55:36.365]  That already happened.
[02:55:37.306 --> 02:55:51.840]  Folks, if we have a real presidential election and the votes aren't rigged, President Trump will win in a record landslide.
[02:55:52.080 --> 02:55:52.740]  Won't even be close.
[02:55:53.721 --> 02:55:54.202]  Won't even be close.
[02:55:56.613 --> 02:56:00.756]  There's no candidate on the Democrat side right now that could even hold a candle to Trump.
[02:56:01.316 --> 02:56:02.737]  The most popular is by far Bernie.
[02:56:04.359 --> 02:56:10.443]  But you gotta remember, Bernie already ran a failed presidential campaign where half of his voters sued him.
[02:56:13.065 --> 02:56:14.306]  They know he's a total cuck.
[02:56:14.506 --> 02:56:15.627]  They know he's a total fraud.
[02:56:16.107 --> 02:56:21.331]  So... I mean, Trump could honestly get 70 million votes.
[02:56:23.132 --> 02:56:23.853]  I think that'd be a record.
[02:56:30.568 --> 02:56:35.251]  Because you gotta understand, folks, a lot of conservatives and Republicans, they didn't vote for Trump!
[02:56:37.253 --> 02:56:42.517]  They were still deceived by the media, they were still deceived by the Republican neocon establishment, they didn't vote Trump.
[02:56:42.917 --> 02:56:44.058]  They're now voting Trump.
[02:56:44.398 --> 02:56:47.220]  You're talking tens of millions of voters.
[02:56:47.681 --> 02:56:50.243]  And don't forget about all those Democrats in the walkway movement, too.
[02:56:52.452 --> 02:56:58.474]  I mean, in a fair election, folks, Trump will win in a record landslide.
[02:56:58.814 --> 02:57:00.155]  But we're not going to get a fair election.
[02:57:00.335 --> 02:57:03.076]  The Democrats are already bringing in non-citizens to vote.
[02:57:03.356 --> 02:57:08.338]  The Democrats have already been caught bussing in ballots at the midnight hour during election night.
[02:57:08.578 --> 02:57:13.619]  The Democrats have already been caught registering dead voters, registering people who have moved to vote.
[02:57:14.260 --> 02:57:18.121]  The Democrats are already cheating six ways to Sunday.
[02:57:19.121 --> 02:57:20.462]  And they still couldn't beat Trump.
[02:57:22.210 --> 02:57:29.476]  But imagine if there was a fair election, and you know, I think that that's almost what this country needs more than anything else.
[02:57:29.856 --> 02:57:44.328]  If we could just have one real election that isn't rigged by the electronic voting machines, just one fair election, just so Americans could see that it would really, I mean, really it would be like 100 Republican votes or 100 conservative votes to like 40, 50 million Democrat votes.
[02:57:45.489 --> 02:57:47.210]  And that would be the picture that people need to see.
[02:57:47.230 --> 02:57:49.592]  It's like, yeah, America loves America.
[02:57:52.335 --> 02:57:57.297]  Brian in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:57:57.417 --> 02:58:03.739]  Yeah, so real quickly, you know, I own the Alexa Pure Pro because I love my neighbor, but I refuse to drink their heart medication.
[02:58:03.779 --> 02:58:06.199]  Well water is some of the most polluted stuff in the country.
[02:58:06.699 --> 02:58:11.561]  You got Glymphosate, you got all your neighbor's medications that they're putting into a septic tank.
[02:58:11.681 --> 02:58:13.762]  That then goes into the groundwater and you drink it.
[02:58:13.822 --> 02:58:16.142]  So absolutely, the number one thing anybody can do.
[02:58:16.442 --> 02:58:17.823]  By the way, I forget to do this and get mad.
[02:58:18.243 --> 02:58:22.046]  When I drink filtered water, when I take the supplements, my life's so much better.
[02:58:22.386 --> 02:58:26.730]  When I forget, because I'm not Mr. Frickin' Health, I feel it.
[02:58:26.770 --> 02:58:29.873]  So yes, tell me about not wanting to drink your neighbor's heart medication.
[02:58:29.933 --> 02:58:42.363]  Well, where I live, and I think this is the same story for most of the country, our water filtration is based on a reverse osmosis system that was constructed around the turn of the century, and I have zero, zero faith
[02:58:43.344 --> 02:58:48.831]  Well, look at Flint, Michigan.
[02:58:49.011 --> 02:58:52.876]  Their water is full of lead, mercury, poisons, E. coli.
[02:58:53.156 --> 02:58:56.901]  The answer is, everyone, if you're drinking water, you should filter it.
[02:58:57.021 --> 02:58:58.222]  And I'll never forget David Hogg.
[02:58:58.763 --> 02:59:06.745]  Goes, you know, Alex Jones on C-SPAN, he goes, little anti-gun guy, he goes, he says the water has toxins and then he sells a water filter.
[02:59:06.905 --> 02:59:14.987]  Yeah, it's like saying your kids need vitamin C and then I sell vitamin C. Or Jones says we need to wear shoes.
[02:59:15.227 --> 02:59:16.227]  We walk in the snow.
[02:59:16.647 --> 02:59:17.847]  Then he advertises shoes.
[02:59:18.027 --> 02:59:18.947]  Yes, exactly.
[02:59:19.268 --> 02:59:20.688]  But see, in his little brain,
[02:59:21.328 --> 02:59:22.749]  Where everything is a scam.
[02:59:23.249 --> 02:59:26.070]  He thinks I'm scamming people when it's a direct sale.
[02:59:26.230 --> 02:59:27.831]  We have the best gravity-fed systems.
[02:59:27.871 --> 02:59:30.472]  Alexa Pure and Pro Pure are apples and oranges, but they're both excellent.
[02:59:30.652 --> 02:59:31.473]  Everyone needs it.
[02:59:31.653 --> 02:59:32.893]  Everyone should filter their water.
[02:59:32.913 --> 02:59:34.294]  This is the smartest thing you can do.
[02:59:34.314 --> 02:59:36.395]  It doesn't mean occasionally you don't drink some ice tea at a restaurant.
[02:59:36.435 --> 02:59:38.156]  But you need to filter your water.
[02:59:38.296 --> 02:59:39.716]  Your skin is your biggest organ.
[02:59:39.796 --> 02:59:40.797]  You absorb it there.
[02:59:40.957 --> 02:59:43.578]  You need filters on your shower or your bath.
[02:59:43.918 --> 02:59:44.638]  Exactly.
[02:59:44.718 --> 02:59:46.499]  And then you look at what's in the water table.
[02:59:46.679 --> 02:59:47.760]  It's insane!
[02:59:56.221 --> 03:00:10.136]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:10.216 --> 03:00:17.003]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[03:00:17.043 --> 03:00:18.825]  You better believe you got one!
[03:00:21.428 --> 03:00:26.306]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:44.392 --> 03:00:53.575]  New York City was well on its way to boasting a proposed 47 total skyscrapers, which would loom over Manhattan in the coming decade.
[03:00:53.815 --> 03:01:03.559]  These spires of steel and glass representing the success of a free market industrial society are too much for New York's mayor and potential 2020
[03:01:04.679 --> 03:01:18.245]  Presidential candidate Bill de Blasio, a self-avowed socialist who aims to take the baton from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and plunge the failed Green New Deal into the heart of America's financial hub.
[03:01:18.606 --> 03:01:21.167]  And I happen to have one here.
[03:01:21.987 --> 03:01:24.288]  The one NYC 2050 plan.
[03:01:25.009 --> 03:01:27.410]  This is just the introductory book.
[03:01:27.570 --> 03:01:29.091]  There's nine books total.
[03:01:30.351 --> 03:01:32.952]  It talks about what this city needs to look like in 2050.
[03:01:34.722 --> 03:01:38.107]  But it begins with the assumption that we have to make sure we're still here in 2050.
[03:01:38.727 --> 03:01:48.180]  The New York City Green New Deal is a $14 billion effort to change things while we still can.
[03:01:48.580 --> 03:01:52.565]  For the first time on Earth, a major city says no more.
[03:01:53.286 --> 03:01:57.530]  It's now law that our buildings must do the right thing for the people of this city.
[03:01:57.951 --> 03:02:02.515]  And I want to be very clear, the landlords who play by the rules are not going to have a problem.
[03:02:02.875 --> 03:02:08.581]  But any landlord who does not achieve these goals will be subject to fines of up to $1 million per year.
[03:02:10.743 --> 03:02:25.471]  You made quite a bit of news last week when you announced that New York City will now guarantee health care to anyone who needs it, including 300,000 undocumented immigrants at the cost of $100 million.
[03:02:26.172 --> 03:02:30.134]  But what do you say to people who say they don't want to pay for the undocumented?
[03:02:30.334 --> 03:02:32.635]  Okay, let me tell you why we're doing it first and then I'll answer that.
[03:02:32.675 --> 03:02:32.835]  Okay.
[03:02:33.536 --> 03:02:34.936]  Everyone should have a right to health care.
[03:02:35.497 --> 03:02:36.077]  Here's the idea.
[03:02:36.277 --> 03:02:37.558]  Everyone should have a right to health care.
[03:02:38.138 --> 03:02:50.173]  To help close a $14 billion hole in its capital budget, the mayor would consider supporting a range of initiatives, including the East River tolls, or raising some or all of the taxes that now help fund the Mass Transit Agency.
[03:02:50.293 --> 03:02:51.135]  No tolls.
[03:02:51.295 --> 03:02:51.916]  Absolutely not.
[03:02:51.936 --> 03:02:52.797]  Thumbs down.
[03:02:53.177 --> 03:03:07.602]  Mayor de Blasio's comrade, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, has enacted policies creating a $2.3 billion black hole in New York State's budget, which Cuomo has continually blamed on President Trump's tax cuts.
[03:03:07.722 --> 03:03:10.523]  Let us address our issues.
[03:03:11.543 --> 03:03:17.705]  Our very real issues with a progressive agenda, not a regressive agenda.
[03:03:18.025 --> 03:03:24.928]  An agenda that moves us up, forward, and united, not down, backwards, and divided.
[03:03:25.308 --> 03:03:34.451]  It may surprise you, but I don't fault our federal government for causing the underlying fear and frustration.
[03:03:35.511 --> 03:03:37.212]  But I fault them for something worse.
[03:03:38.320 --> 03:03:42.642]  I fault them for a failure of leadership and government malfeasance.
[03:03:43.142 --> 03:03:50.525]  But it's actually the policies of Cuomo and mayors like de Blasio accelerating New York towards a financial crisis.
[03:03:50.845 --> 03:04:01.029]  As the Hill reported, New Yorkers pay an average of 12.7% of their income in state and local taxes and face some of the highest property taxes in the nation.
[03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:08.571]  New York City, where more than 40% of the state population lives, is the most expensive city in America.
[03:04:08.771 --> 03:04:15.073]  With affordable neighborhoods riddled with crime and homelessness, it's no wonder why people are fleeing in droves.
[03:04:15.273 --> 03:04:24.036]  With 1.2 million New Yorkers leaving since 2010, last year New York had the largest overall population loss in the nation.
[03:04:24.276 --> 03:04:37.279]  Adding insult to injury, a measles outbreak, the magnitude of which has not been seen in 25 years, has gripped the five boroughs, especially in Brooklyn, where de Blasio is forcing mandatory vaccinations.
[03:04:37.599 --> 03:04:47.882]  New York City, much like San Francisco, has become yet another mad scientist's laboratory for socialism, a dangerous, creeping disease that could take the U.S.
[03:04:47.982 --> 03:04:49.883]  financial system down with it.
[03:04:50.263 --> 03:04:51.523]  John Bowne reporting.
[03:04:56.463 --> 03:05:00.587]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:05:01.308 --> 03:05:02.749]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:05:08.010 --> 03:05:11.911]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[03:05:12.352 --> 03:05:14.152]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:05:14.272 --> 03:05:14.972]  Good to talk to you.
[03:05:15.313 --> 03:05:19.474]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:05:19.694 --> 03:05:21.435]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[03:05:21.535 --> 03:05:25.916]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:05:26.136 --> 03:05:28.037]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[03:05:28.117 --> 03:05:32.458]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[03:05:32.538 --> 03:05:34.019]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:05:34.059 --> 03:05:34.599]  Tell us about it.
[03:05:34.619 --> 03:05:35.319]  Well, it's really great.
[03:05:35.339 --> 03:05:36.540]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:05:36.600 --> 03:05:37.040]  I take it.
[03:05:37.080 --> 03:05:37.700]  It tastes good.
[03:05:37.780 --> 03:05:39.461]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:05:39.541 --> 03:05:41.221]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:05:41.381 --> 03:05:44.663]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:05:44.683 --> 03:05:47.364]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:05:47.404 --> 03:05:48.944]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:05:49.064 --> 03:05:50.925]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:05:51.045 --> 03:05:51.525]  So, yeah.
[03:05:51.905 --> 03:05:53.766]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:05:54.226 --> 03:05:56.527]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[03:05:56.547 --> 03:05:57.827]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[03:06:43.018 --> 03:06:47.942]  I just, guys, I just don't think, I just don't think I have the energy today to do fourth hour.
[03:06:47.962 --> 03:06:49.463]  I just don't think I can do it, guys.
[03:06:49.903 --> 03:06:53.086]  Owen, Owen, I'm getting sick and tired of your BS during the breaks today.
[03:06:53.246 --> 03:06:54.747]  Been bitching all day off air.
[03:06:54.947 --> 03:06:56.148]  I'm tired of being a damn cuck.
[03:06:56.388 --> 03:07:01.393]  Will you just take some of the cuck package that we got here and just fix yourself, man.
[03:07:01.633 --> 03:07:02.073]  Fix it.
[03:07:02.353 --> 03:07:02.934]  I'm sick of it.
[03:07:05.211 --> 03:07:13.478]  Okay, um, I guess I'll try this, uh, Super, Super Male Vitality?
[03:07:13.498 --> 03:07:15.941]  Alright, I'll give it a try.
[03:07:15.961 --> 03:07:22.887]  Hmm, says two scoops, or two droppers, okay.
[03:07:24.588 --> 03:07:24.809]  Hmm.
[03:07:28.212 --> 03:07:29.593]  Super Male Vitality, huh?
[03:07:35.694 --> 03:07:37.295]  I guess I kind of feel something.

[03:07:46.858 --> 03:07:47.418]  I don't know.
[03:07:47.678 --> 03:07:50.759]  I mean... I don't know.
[03:07:50.839 --> 03:07:53.520]  I'm not totally feeling it yet.
[03:07:53.600 --> 03:07:57.381]  Let me just... Let me try this Alpha Power?
[03:07:58.842 --> 03:08:01.703]  Alpha Power from InfoWarsStore.com?

[03:08:12.751 --> 03:08:13.511]  Maybe this will help.
[03:08:20.514 --> 03:08:21.415]  Alpha Power, huh?
[03:08:25.576 --> 03:08:29.038]  I think I'm... I think I'm starting to feel something.

[03:09:32.466 --> 03:09:33.026]  That's right.
[03:09:33.446 --> 03:09:36.267]  Toxic masculinity at its finest.
[03:09:41.469 --> 03:09:42.350]  Good job to the crew.
[03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:43.250]  We did it.
[03:09:43.350 --> 03:09:44.011]  We did it live.
[03:09:44.031 --> 03:09:45.191]  F it.
[03:09:45.371 --> 03:09:46.231]  We're just gonna do it live.
[03:09:46.252 --> 03:09:48.633]  And I'm just gonna wear the small t-shirt the rest of the day.
[03:09:48.653 --> 03:09:49.933]  How about that?
[03:09:50.793 --> 03:09:52.154]  Or maybe I'll get one that actually fits.
[03:09:53.595 --> 03:09:54.735]  Alright, let me put my earpiece in.
[03:09:55.676 --> 03:09:56.416]  Let's get a crew cam.
[03:09:57.867 --> 03:09:58.207]  Okay.
[03:09:58.928 --> 03:09:59.709]  Let's get a crew cam.
[03:10:00.709 --> 03:10:01.470]  Give me a crew cam.
[03:10:03.412 --> 03:10:04.413]  Great job by the crew.
[03:10:05.474 --> 03:10:06.414]  Great job by the crew.
[03:10:06.955 --> 03:10:10.098]  We tried to do this live on The War Room a couple days ago.
[03:10:10.138 --> 03:10:10.998]  Great job by Connor.
[03:10:11.098 --> 03:10:12.219]  Give Connor a round of applause.
[03:10:12.259 --> 03:10:12.920]  He really sold it.
[03:10:13.520 --> 03:10:14.361]  He really sold it.
[03:10:14.401 --> 03:10:14.962]  Yeah, take a bow.
[03:10:16.377 --> 03:10:17.798]  Great job by the crew right there.
[03:10:17.838 --> 03:10:19.180]  We tried to do this on the War Room.
[03:10:19.480 --> 03:10:21.502]  We were sabotaged by Marcos Morales.
[03:10:22.382 --> 03:10:25.685]  He hulked my soundboard down and it caused a mic outage.
[03:10:25.746 --> 03:10:26.266]  But you know what?
[03:10:26.286 --> 03:10:28.068]  We did it live again and we knocked it out.
[03:10:29.609 --> 03:10:30.510]  Great job to the crew!
[03:10:32.111 --> 03:10:32.472]  We did it.
[03:10:32.992 --> 03:10:35.875]  And so that's going to be the Total Cuck Cleanse ad.
[03:10:37.602 --> 03:10:45.549]  That we're going to run now during break, so make sure we get that to A-List ASAP, guys, and let's start running that in break.
[03:10:45.749 --> 03:10:46.991]  But here's the deal, folks.
[03:10:47.992 --> 03:10:49.893]  I actually thought about doing this ad.
[03:10:51.755 --> 03:10:58.201]  The gimmick is for the radio audience, I started in an extra large t-shirt, and now I'm in a small t-shirt.
[03:10:58.701 --> 03:11:01.044]  And so the gimmick is, I also had a tiny little
[03:11:03.379 --> 03:11:05.200]  A tiny little CUCK megaphone here.
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:08.602]  It even has C... Look, it even is the CUCK version.
[03:11:09.262 --> 03:11:09.883]  The CMR-15.
[03:11:10.003 --> 03:11:12.264]  It's the CUCK version here.
[03:11:12.424 --> 03:11:14.165]  And so I even started with the little megaphone.
[03:11:14.686 --> 03:11:18.628]  And then we advanced to the big InfoWars megaphone.
[03:11:19.028 --> 03:11:26.813]  Which, if you play your cards right, this megaphone may end up with
[03:11:27.895 --> 03:11:30.137]  With you, in your hands, to fight the InfoWars.
[03:11:30.177 --> 03:11:34.081]  But yeah, this is the, uh, Cuck Mobile Ranger megaphone right here.
[03:11:34.722 --> 03:11:43.050]  Uh, that's, that's been uncucked and is now the InfoWars Welcome to the Thunderdome, bitch, megaphone.
[03:11:43.670 --> 03:11:48.635]  Which I have right here, which I'm about to send out to a fierce patriot today.
[03:11:48.815 --> 03:11:51.017]  This is about to be sent out to a fierce patriot.
[03:11:51.863 --> 03:11:52.483]  And here's the deal.
[03:11:52.903 --> 03:11:55.204]  Don't come in here and try to sabotage this ad now.
[03:11:56.065 --> 03:11:58.206]  Don't you come in here and try to sabotage this ad.
[03:11:58.246 --> 03:12:00.147]  This is the one that sabotaged it during the war room.
[03:12:00.167 --> 03:12:00.987]  Marcos Morales.
[03:12:01.667 --> 03:12:02.888]  Did you just want to flex your muscles?
[03:12:03.748 --> 03:12:05.449]  I just wanted to redo my flex.
[03:12:06.069 --> 03:12:07.130]  This guy called me out.
[03:12:07.150 --> 03:12:10.951]  It was your weak cuck microphone that got cut.
[03:12:11.452 --> 03:12:12.152]  Cut itself.
[03:12:12.752 --> 03:12:14.993]  You know, only a real cuck would blame the equipment.
[03:12:18.475 --> 03:12:21.336]  This is why he has to break his bass guitar after every live show.
[03:12:22.790 --> 03:12:24.090]  Marcos Morales, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:12:24.110 --> 03:12:26.251]  He's been here for forever, really.
[03:12:27.311 --> 03:12:29.712]  He puts out a lot of the great graphics that you see here.
[03:12:30.612 --> 03:12:31.473]  The 3D graphics.
[03:12:31.493 --> 03:12:32.753]  That's Marcos Morales' work.
[03:12:32.773 --> 03:12:33.453]  He does a great job.
[03:12:33.493 --> 03:12:35.734]  But I'll just go ahead and do this now.
[03:12:35.814 --> 03:12:37.915]  So first of all, the Total Cut Cleanse.
[03:12:37.955 --> 03:12:40.456]  This is a real special at Infowarstore.com.
[03:12:40.916 --> 03:12:43.977]  And I planned on doing this bit with the t-shirts to promote Supermail.
[03:12:44.477 --> 03:12:46.237]  And it's just the symbiosis that happens here.
[03:12:46.437 --> 03:12:47.158]  It's really unbelievable.
[03:12:47.518 --> 03:12:49.378]  And then we came out with the Total Cut Cleanse.
[03:12:49.458 --> 03:12:50.759]  I didn't even know this was going on.
[03:12:51.693 --> 03:12:56.275]  And then that was, it ended up just kind of being the perfect little bit to cut and add for it.
[03:12:57.275 --> 03:12:59.216]  So, but take advantage of the Total Cut Cleanse.
[03:12:59.236 --> 03:13:04.918]  You get super male vitality and alpha power 50% off in the combo pack.

[03:13:11.521 --> 03:13:13.381]  Maybe we should send some to Brian Stelter.
[03:13:14.362 --> 03:13:16.583]  Maybe we should send some to Brian Stelter.
[03:13:16.643 --> 03:13:18.783]  Who I've heard is, he may be joining us again.
[03:13:19.204 --> 03:13:20.104]  Oh my gosh!
[03:13:22.762 --> 03:13:30.366]  I'm not sure where they found that picture of Brian, but, uh, kids, you know, you see, like, drug awareness ad campaigns.
[03:13:31.347 --> 03:13:34.049]  Brian Stelter is the donut awareness ad campaign.
[03:13:35.129 --> 03:13:36.430]  There's the soy face right there.
[03:13:36.970 --> 03:13:40.352]  Yeah, just take the total cuck cleanse from mtlwrestore.com and it'll work.
[03:13:40.372 --> 03:13:41.353]  But here's the thing.
[03:13:43.763 --> 03:13:48.952]  I've decided to turn this megaphone right here into a story.
[03:13:49.853 --> 03:13:52.918]  And so, I'm just gonna do this right now, and then here's the deal.
[03:13:53.979 --> 03:13:58.281]  This megaphone was actually created for a radio audience.
[03:13:58.381 --> 03:13:59.342]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[03:13:59.382 --> 03:14:02.724]  It's got all InfoWars bumper stickers and everything totally decked out.
[03:14:02.784 --> 03:14:12.169]  You can't even find any original color from the megaphone because it's totally decked out in InfoWars stickers and a bunch of customization.
[03:14:12.329 --> 03:14:13.130]  Just really awesome.
[03:14:13.890 --> 03:14:20.594]  So it was the InfoWars Army Kansas that was originally using this for the protests that they did.
[03:14:21.747 --> 03:14:23.889]  I believe they brought it to Houston for a Trump rally.
[03:14:24.410 --> 03:14:30.615]  They brought it to a Planned Parenthood protest here in Austin, which is when they handed it over to Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:14:30.875 --> 03:14:40.104]  And actually, the individual who was responsible for making this, I believe he's joining the Marines now, so we salute him.
[03:14:40.945 --> 03:14:42.006]  But he handed this to us.
[03:14:42.955 --> 03:14:48.423]  Now, we've got some other mega phones that we use and other bullhorns that we use.
[03:14:49.004 --> 03:14:52.188]  And quite frankly, this one doesn't get utilized enough by us.
[03:14:52.329 --> 03:14:53.450]  So what I figured is...
[03:14:54.537 --> 03:14:59.441]  We're going to turn this into kind of like an Olympic torch, if you will, of InfoWars.
[03:14:59.721 --> 03:15:08.149]  So what I'm going to do is I'm about to send this bullhorn out to a patriot near you, to an InfoWarrior near you.
[03:15:08.769 --> 03:15:19.078]  And so this individual, who we'll identify once he receives it, and we'll bring him on the war room that I host three to six weekdays here at InfoWars.com slash show.
[03:15:19.098 --> 03:15:21.800]  We'll bring him on the air and we'll show you who gets this.
[03:15:21.820 --> 03:15:22.761]  And then here's what's going to happen.
[03:15:24.093 --> 03:15:31.023]  He's gonna use it for all of his political activism and all the stuff that he's engaged in.
[03:15:31.703 --> 03:15:40.475]  And then, when he's ready to bestow the legendary InfoWars bullhorn to someone else, he will then pass the torch.
[03:15:41.502 --> 03:15:45.445]  And then it will become legend, and you will continue to pass it, and pass it, and pass it.
[03:15:45.465 --> 03:15:46.085]  So who knows?
[03:15:46.506 --> 03:15:47.306]  Who will be?
[03:15:47.947 --> 03:15:52.590]  Who will raise the Infowars Legendary Bullhorn next?
[03:15:53.130 --> 03:15:54.912]  It's coming to a patriot near you!
[03:15:55.252 --> 03:16:00.516]  If you engage in political activism, you could be the recipient of the Infowars Bullhorn!
[03:16:09.031 --> 03:16:14.596]  I've got police officers sat with a recording, in a recording van, and the back of this van is a recording station.
[03:16:14.616 --> 03:16:15.737]  I'm not standing, you're not going there.
[03:16:15.957 --> 03:16:17.739]  No, cos I, no, cos what yous are doing, I know what yous are doing.
[03:16:17.759 --> 03:16:19.000]  I know what yous are doing.
[03:16:19.020 --> 03:16:20.361]  I know what yous are doing.
[03:16:20.741 --> 03:16:30.469]  They're sat in the back of their van, this is recording devices, the whole of this back thing, cos he just opened it up when I got him out, the whole of this back thing is recording, where they're pointing there, cos they, what this is, has been a set-up.
[03:16:30.810 --> 03:16:32.731]  These people have set, these police officers are setting me up.
[03:16:35.836 --> 03:16:36.737]  They're setting me up.
[03:16:37.177 --> 03:16:37.838]  It's a setup.
[03:16:38.679 --> 03:16:44.204]  They're setting me up by sending people to my house because they think I'm going to react and do something, and they're recording it with listening devices.
[03:16:44.904 --> 03:16:48.768]  Tommy, I don't know how to build this up because it's already so crazy.
[03:16:49.228 --> 03:16:50.830]  I mean, there's no way to properly build it up.
[03:16:50.890 --> 03:16:51.831]  It's so out of control.
[03:16:51.891 --> 03:16:55.194]  You are literally under siege by MI5 on record.
[03:16:55.794 --> 03:16:59.275]  The footage from earlier, what I realize now, is I'm being set up.
[03:16:59.295 --> 03:17:00.195]  So, on Sunday,
[03:17:13.422 --> 03:17:18.246]  Far-left activists were given the address that my children and my wife were at.
[03:17:18.566 --> 03:17:21.108]  They were handed documentation by a lawyer.
[03:17:21.368 --> 03:17:28.674]  He handed documentation over to far-left extremists who then travelled with The Guardian, with the mainstream media.
[03:17:29.254 --> 03:17:33.437]  They travelled to a property that my wife and children were in.
[03:17:34.258 --> 03:17:35.839]  So private information given.
[03:17:36.760 --> 03:17:41.203]  Then I guess I was supposed to come and probably violently attack them.
[03:17:41.704 --> 03:17:43.065]  But I wasn't even in the country.
[03:17:43.906 --> 03:18:02.743]  So then, my wife has had to ring the police, my children have locked themselves inside the house, six men have turned up, led by a man who, if you go through his social media yesterday, was making comments about my children being put through meat grinders whilst my house was set on fire whilst he masturbated watching.
[03:18:03.644 --> 03:18:10.010]  This is the man sent with the Guardian, with the national newspapers, with a jihadi lawyer,
[03:18:10.450 --> 03:18:14.052]  From the same office that government organisations such as Tell Mama are funded.
[03:18:14.732 --> 03:18:25.496]  So this is where, then today, I travelled, because I'm moving my children, I travelled and I witnessed a van, which you've seen the video of, I witnessed a van park near to my house.
[03:18:25.696 --> 03:18:29.238]  So I stopped and I confronted the two men and said, who are you and what are you doing?
[03:18:29.278 --> 03:18:30.298]  They've said, we're plumbers.
[03:18:30.558 --> 03:18:31.719]  I said, well, where have you been working?
[03:18:31.739 --> 03:18:32.660]  Which house are you working?
[03:18:32.700 --> 03:18:34.141]  They goes, look, we're just on our way home.
[03:18:34.201 --> 03:18:35.202]  I said, you're not on your way home.
[03:18:35.242 --> 03:18:36.463]  You're in a cul-de-sac.
[03:18:36.583 --> 03:18:38.365]  Where have you been, and what are you doing?
[03:18:38.505 --> 03:18:40.907]  And I videoed him, and then they tell me to stop videoing.
[03:18:41.007 --> 03:18:44.169]  When I stop videoing, they try and drive off.
[03:18:44.209 --> 03:18:48.833]  So I stand in the way in a car saying, you're going to have to run me over before you leave and don't tell me who you are and what you're doing.
[03:18:48.853 --> 03:18:51.655]  Because there are threats to my family, and I want to know who you are.
[03:18:51.696 --> 03:18:54.518]  He then, because he has to, shows me a police badge.
[03:18:54.778 --> 03:18:59.322]  So essentially, the people who come to my children's home, the people that sent them there,
[03:18:59.982 --> 03:19:02.786]  I've been already for the last 48 hours building a dossier.
[03:19:02.806 --> 03:19:04.267]  Do you know what I've found?
[03:19:04.628 --> 03:19:06.350]  Which you will all see, the world will see.
[03:19:07.032 --> 03:19:11.494]  I've found that these groups who work with our government groups, there's a group called Resisting Hate.
[03:19:12.075 --> 03:19:17.958]  I have video footage of the darkest pornographic videos made by the leaders of this organization.
[03:19:18.378 --> 03:19:21.199]  The faces who sit on interviews on TV.
[03:19:21.239 --> 03:19:22.880]  Tommy, of course they're Satanists!
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:23.401]  I know!
[03:19:23.621 --> 03:19:25.402]  You're fighting the pedophile vampires!
[03:19:25.562 --> 03:19:27.743]  I'm going to show the world who these people are.
[03:19:27.923 --> 03:19:29.364]  I've known a lot of this information.
[03:19:29.424 --> 03:19:31.985]  I've known where a lot of these operatives live and I've done nothing.
[03:19:32.245 --> 03:19:32.445]  Yeah?
[03:19:32.845 --> 03:19:35.807]  Because I don't want to bring trouble to someone's door.
[03:19:36.327 --> 03:19:46.571]  I'm now going to show the world, the next time these profiles and these people say these things and support these groups... What you're saying is they crossed the line, they drew first blood.
[03:19:47.652 --> 03:19:48.432]  They crossed the line.
[03:19:48.452 --> 03:19:56.736]  I'm going to make sure every single one of their neighbours, everyone in their roads, everyone in their community knows the deep, dark, sadistic side of their life.
[03:20:06.165 --> 03:20:10.607]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.648 --> 03:20:18.090]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:18.170 --> 03:20:18.850]  I feel good.
[03:20:18.970 --> 03:20:21.432]  I knew that I would.
[03:20:22.592 --> 03:20:23.232]  I feel good.
[03:20:32.247 --> 03:20:42.334]  I do feel pretty good.
[03:20:43.114 --> 03:20:47.237]  I just took the total cucked cleanse from InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:20:47.277 --> 03:20:50.019]  Sugar and Spice.
[03:20:50.099 --> 03:20:52.741]  No, that's not Maxine Waters.
[03:20:52.761 --> 03:20:53.822]  That's James Brown.
[03:21:02.310 --> 03:21:10.114]  See, Maxine Waters stole James Brown's wig because she wanted to get some of that soul.
[03:21:10.955 --> 03:21:11.775]  She has no soul.
[03:21:12.856 --> 03:21:18.599]  Maxine Waters has no soul, so she stole James Brown's wig.
[03:21:18.679 --> 03:21:25.942]  She was hoping when she put the James Brown wig on her chrome dome, she was hoping that she would get some of that soul.
[03:21:26.803 --> 03:21:28.784]  Sorry, Maxine Waters, that's not how it works.
[03:21:29.905 --> 03:21:30.645]  You have no soul.
[03:21:33.717 --> 03:21:34.838]  You do have a Chrome Dome, though.
[03:21:36.239 --> 03:21:37.000]  Boy, I'll tell ya.
[03:21:37.060 --> 03:21:41.884]  You know, I... Please do not do this.
[03:21:43.285 --> 03:21:45.748]  And I'm not saying that I'm encouraging this.
[03:21:46.368 --> 03:21:53.554]  All I'm saying is, wouldn't it be funny if someone just did like a... Because this has been done before with other, like, popular YouTubers.
[03:21:54.522 --> 03:22:04.005]  I won't name names or give any context, but it's basically like they say, uh, they do a competition where if you can go take the hat off of this person, uh, they get an award.
[03:22:04.045 --> 03:22:09.927]  It's like, what if someone said, if you could pull Maxine Waters' wig off of her head, you'd get a million bucks.
[03:22:11.007 --> 03:22:11.887]  Oh my gosh.
[03:22:13.008 --> 03:22:17.729]  Uh, no, do not, do not approach Maxine Waters to pull the James Brown wig off of her head.
[03:22:17.909 --> 03:22:19.150]  Do not, do not do that.
[03:22:19.290 --> 03:22:21.470]  We don't want to see that chrome dome exposed.
[03:22:23.211 --> 03:22:23.531]  All right.
[03:22:24.394 --> 03:22:26.155]  We're into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:22:28.115 --> 03:22:29.035]  And here's what I'm going to do.
[03:22:29.055 --> 03:22:31.356]  I'm going to open up the phone lines right now.
[03:22:32.917 --> 03:22:34.757]  And then I'm just going to knock out the rest of this news.
[03:22:34.797 --> 03:22:42.820]  But guys, let's go ahead and... Let's go ahead and open the phone lines here.
[03:22:45.447 --> 03:23:01.404]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, and we'll take your calls on any of the subjects that we've discussed so far today, or any of the subjects that I'm about to discuss here.
[03:23:01.464 --> 03:23:03.627]  So, we're opening up the phone lines right now.
[03:23:05.103 --> 03:23:14.556]  And in the last couple segments, I'll squeeze in some phone calls today, and then Will Johnson is hosting the War Room for me today.
[03:23:15.938 --> 03:23:18.902]  Let me just go right into this stack here of cultural news.
[03:23:20.549 --> 03:23:22.592]  Americans getting more inactive.
[03:23:23.353 --> 03:23:24.995]  Computers partly to blame.
[03:23:25.396 --> 03:23:28.240]  And I think it's just in general screen time and smartphones and everything.
[03:23:29.201 --> 03:23:30.803]  This was also in the news today.
[03:23:31.244 --> 03:23:35.309]  The lure of computers means Americans are sitting more than before.
[03:23:35.409 --> 03:23:37.072]  Now here's the thing about this trend.
[03:23:38.397 --> 03:23:44.623]  And Alex talks about this a lot, and I think even humans just kind of know this, but you wonder, is this our destiny?
[03:23:45.103 --> 03:23:46.364]  Is this where Satan is taking us?
[03:23:46.404 --> 03:23:47.085]  What is this all about?
[03:23:47.125 --> 03:23:49.827]  But it all leads to the same thing.
[03:23:49.927 --> 03:23:58.935]  Humans merging with machines, and eventually our environment and our atmosphere will be so toxic, unless you merge with the machine, you won't be able to survive.
[03:23:59.455 --> 03:24:01.597]  See the 5G technology that they're about to roll out.
[03:24:03.238 --> 03:24:03.719]  And so,
[03:24:06.303 --> 03:24:11.188]  I just sit here and I question, is this really human's destiny?
[03:24:11.448 --> 03:24:12.389]  Can we stop this?
[03:24:12.469 --> 03:24:13.990]  Do we want to go down this road?
[03:24:14.571 --> 03:24:15.652]  What do we do to combat this?
[03:24:15.712 --> 03:24:17.453]  Because it just gets worse and worse with the youth.
[03:24:17.473 --> 03:24:27.943]  I mean, the average, you know, toddler now is engaging in regular screen time.
[03:24:29.611 --> 03:24:41.216]  And you know, they're putting 5G antennas on top of schools and stuff now, even though they just had to get rid of a cell antenna from a school because it was causing kids to have cancer.
[03:24:41.616 --> 03:24:42.297]  So just get ready.
[03:24:42.717 --> 03:24:48.259]  And who knows what they're putting in the chemtrails, who knows what's in the food or any of these adjuvants in the vaccines.
[03:24:48.620 --> 03:24:53.442]  They could jack something, you could have something in your body right now, and you wouldn't know it.
[03:24:54.022 --> 03:25:06.886]  You could have something in your body right now that you've either breathed in or ingested that can be targeted and triggered by radio waves, by cell waves.
[03:25:07.206 --> 03:25:08.487]  Oh, you didn't think about that, did you?
[03:25:10.408 --> 03:25:11.488]  You might want to wake up.
[03:25:12.428 --> 03:25:18.950]  Vegan Feminist Cafe that imposed 18% gender surcharge on men closes down.
[03:25:19.311 --> 03:25:21.371]  Paul Joseph Watson has the story at InfoWars.com.
[03:25:21.611 --> 03:25:23.212]  Well, I'm shocked.
[03:25:24.821 --> 03:25:26.342]  A vegan feminist cafe?
[03:25:26.462 --> 03:25:29.082]  First of all, okay, good luck with that, I guess?
[03:25:29.523 --> 03:25:32.524]  That's a fake photo of Michelle Obama they even have on their wall.
[03:25:32.704 --> 03:25:35.845]  They took a picture of Michelle Obama and actually put it on a woman's body.
[03:25:36.085 --> 03:25:36.685]  That's hilarious.
[03:25:37.545 --> 03:25:41.807]  Uh, but... Yeah, wow, and then they're sexist against men?
[03:25:42.387 --> 03:25:45.068]  And you didn't make it in business?
[03:25:45.248 --> 03:25:46.568]  Wow, I'm so stunned.
[03:25:47.168 --> 03:25:50.569]  I'm sure you went and got an education in business, didn't you?
[03:25:51.450 --> 03:25:51.970]  Dumbasses.
[03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:53.520]  U.S.
[03:25:53.600 --> 03:25:56.283]  Navy drafting new guidelines for reporting UFOs.
[03:25:56.383 --> 03:25:58.084]  Boy, you know, here's the thing about this.
[03:25:59.446 --> 03:26:04.070]  I do like to follow the UFO stuff, and it's intriguing to me.
[03:26:04.110 --> 03:26:05.751]  There's definitely stuff going on out there.
[03:26:05.791 --> 03:26:09.414]  Now, I'm not saying it's aliens or that even I know what it is.
[03:26:09.975 --> 03:26:12.977]  It could be just secret government stuff.
[03:26:13.018 --> 03:26:19.703]  It could just be secret stuff, you know, flying machines, what have you, or just stuff that we've never really been able to explore before until now.
[03:26:21.298 --> 03:26:24.000]  But this to me says they just don't want this stuff going out.
[03:26:24.361 --> 03:26:25.121]  For whatever reason.
[03:26:25.582 --> 03:26:29.065]  They don't want people to be looking into UFOs and stuff.
[03:26:31.527 --> 03:26:33.870]  You know, this one really intrigues me here.
[03:26:35.411 --> 03:26:36.792]  I really don't understand this one.
[03:26:36.812 --> 03:26:38.194]  Because I'm a big movie fanatic.
[03:26:39.054 --> 03:26:43.819]  In fact, I used to review movies, even professionally.
[03:26:45.140 --> 03:26:45.300]  So...
[03:26:46.516 --> 03:26:47.116]  I just don't understand.
[03:26:47.597 --> 03:26:48.537]  Box office preview.
[03:26:48.917 --> 03:26:52.679]  Avengers Endgame preps for record $900 million.
[03:26:53.780 --> 03:26:54.480]  Global bow.
[03:26:54.860 --> 03:26:59.083]  Avengers Endgame prompts theaters to plan 24-hour screenings, double the popcorn.
[03:26:59.543 --> 03:27:06.847]  So, first of all, as a moviegoer and a fan of movies, I don't understand this whole Avengers, it's like an obsession.
[03:27:08.347 --> 03:27:12.670]  But you notice how it's all this, what you're seeing with all these big movie pushes,
[03:27:13.680 --> 03:27:39.426]  There's all this propaganda, not just like the leftist propaganda, but it's always, End Game, Final Battle, End of Humanity, Geostorm, it's this, it's this, they're programming your consciousness to get ready for the end of the world, which again, they'll say they have the solution, plug yourself into this machine, and you can live forever and be free, no, you just died and became a slave as soon as you did that.
[03:27:40.847 --> 03:27:41.547]  This headline,
[03:27:42.518 --> 03:27:44.479]  Is almost the epitome of everything that's going on right now.
[03:27:45.340 --> 03:27:47.461]  As Coachella raged, the L.A.
[03:27:47.501 --> 03:27:49.822]  tech world made plans to live on Mars.
[03:27:50.703 --> 03:27:52.144]  So this is just one story from L.A.
[03:27:52.184 --> 03:27:56.106]  Times, but let me tell you how this actually perfectly encapsulates the world right now.
[03:27:56.606 --> 03:27:58.387]  So Coachella is a big music festival.
[03:27:59.048 --> 03:28:08.754]  So basically here you have humans on Earth, distracted by all the screens and the cell phones and the this's and the that's and the TVs and the Kardashians and the football and the everything.
[03:28:09.904 --> 03:28:13.385]  And it's fun, and they party, and they drink, and they do drugs, and they're living the time of their life.
[03:28:13.465 --> 03:28:21.028]  Meanwhile, as they're dancing, the elite are planning an off-world life.
[03:28:21.288 --> 03:28:26.790]  The elite are literally getting ready for a separatist society, and you're gonna be left in the dust.
[03:28:27.958 --> 03:28:40.282]  But they'll have the whole thing rolled out and ready to go, so that when you finally realize that you're about to get killed, you'll be ready to jump on to whatever ship it is they promise, or whatever life technology extensions that they promise.
[03:28:40.722 --> 03:28:41.642]  But this is what's going on.
[03:28:41.982 --> 03:28:50.005]  As the world is dancing and drinking and getting drunk and high, the elites are planning a separate society.
[03:28:50.385 --> 03:28:52.346]  And you're not invited!
[03:28:53.186 --> 03:28:54.247]  You get nothing!
[03:28:54.647 --> 03:28:55.888]  Enjoy your football!
[03:28:56.169 --> 03:28:57.129]  Enjoy your sports!
[03:28:57.410 --> 03:28:58.831]  Enjoy all of your partying!
[03:28:59.051 --> 03:29:00.152]  You're about to be done!
[03:29:11.977 --> 03:29:20.379]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:29:20.979 --> 03:29:31.041]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:29:31.061 --> 03:29:39.583]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:29:40.452 --> 03:29:41.413]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:29:41.773 --> 03:29:42.814]  You must experience it.
[03:29:42.934 --> 03:29:44.835]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:29:44.915 --> 03:29:49.278]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:29:49.939 --> 03:29:51.380]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:29:51.460 --> 03:29:52.441]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:29:52.941 --> 03:29:59.085]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:29:59.626 --> 03:30:01.127]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.
[03:30:10.612 --> 03:30:12.673]  All right, let's talk to Jim in Dallas.
[03:30:12.813 --> 03:30:14.153]  Jim, you're on the air.
[03:30:14.633 --> 03:30:16.314]  You work with the State National Guard.
[03:30:16.334 --> 03:30:17.534]  People think, oh, State Guard.
[03:30:17.814 --> 03:30:22.316]  That's like the creme de la creme of patriots working with federal and state to try to defend the border.
[03:30:22.356 --> 03:30:24.897]  And Texas is the hot spot, so they're right in the middle of it.
[03:30:24.917 --> 03:30:26.097]  Jim, what are you witnessing down there?
[03:30:26.237 --> 03:30:29.860]  Well, Alex, we just had a staff meeting in Austin this morning.
[03:30:29.901 --> 03:30:38.028]  This isn't getting a lot of attention, but the Attorney General, Attorney General Paxson, and the Governor, Governor Abbott, have called up the Texas State Guard unit.
[03:30:38.048 --> 03:30:43.954]  We've been in contact with Hood and Blitz, and the Adjutant's Office there isn't talking to us, okay?
[03:30:44.014 --> 03:30:45.476]  For some unknown reason.
[03:30:45.496 --> 03:30:48.659]  Now, Major General Boatish is the commander of all Texas forces.
[03:30:49.039 --> 03:30:53.003]  The Texas National Guard, the Texas Air National Guard, and the Texas State Guard.
[03:30:53.083 --> 03:30:55.786]  And he's activating members of the Texas State Guard.
[03:30:55.906 --> 03:31:00.971]  And the next step is the Texas National Guard, but that's got to be approved from Washington.
[03:31:01.011 --> 03:31:02.673]  Well, we don't have time for that, Alex.
[03:31:02.773 --> 03:31:12.763]  If the Board of Patrol and the feds do not do something about this, the next step is Governor Abbott is going to authorize lethal force to prevent this tidal wave coming into the state of Texas.
[03:31:13.303 --> 03:31:24.637]  We're gonna have armed members of the Texas State Guard down in McAllen and over in El Paso by 1800 tonight.
[03:31:24.657 --> 03:31:26.319]  This is coming to a breaking point.
[03:31:26.399 --> 03:31:30.665]  If the federal government is not going to defend Texas, Texans are going to defend Texas.
[03:31:31.025 --> 03:31:33.786]  And we're not waiting for the federal government to do anything.
[03:31:33.846 --> 03:31:41.230]  And I can tell you right now that the 4th and the 8th and the 19th regiments of the Texas State Guard will be there within 72 hours.
[03:31:41.350 --> 03:31:43.111]  And we're not going with rubber bullets.
[03:31:43.191 --> 03:31:44.771]  We're being issued live routes.
[03:31:44.831 --> 03:31:50.614]  We will not let the federal government let Texas be invaded by a tidal wave of disease
[03:31:51.054 --> 03:32:03.999]  And it's just a sad situation that the state of Texas pays 18% of all federal taxes, and we can't get one cavalry soldier from HUD to come down and protect the border.
[03:32:04.179 --> 03:32:12.662]  It's not the responsibility of the state of Texas under our current constitutional setup for Texas to have to appropriate $5.2 billion to build a wall in our state
[03:32:14.503 --> 03:32:19.549]  No, I agree with you, but I'm just telling you, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[03:32:34.665 --> 03:32:38.386]  The beds are overwhelmed, the feds are overwhelmed, the border patrol is overwhelmed.
[03:32:38.846 --> 03:32:40.647]  The Democrats are saying just capitulate.
[03:32:40.887 --> 03:32:47.569]  If we let them break the border, literally 20% of Latin America in the next few years will spill in.
[03:32:48.189 --> 03:32:49.310]  This will be the end of the country.
[03:32:49.390 --> 03:32:50.990]  I mean, this is ending our sovereignty.
[03:32:51.350 --> 03:32:52.911]  This is the new world war right now.
[03:33:06.147 --> 03:33:08.831]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:08.851 --> 03:33:15.580]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:33:25.137 --> 03:33:27.058]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.138 --> 03:33:34.882]  Uh, just to put an end cap in this stack of news here, Elon Musk says machine to connect human brain to computer is coming soon.
[03:33:35.763 --> 03:33:40.505]  Uh, don't worry folks, InfoWars tomorrow's, well, InfoWars next decade's news today.
[03:33:40.526 --> 03:33:43.667]  I mean, it's, it's gonna be, it's not gonna be trendy, it's not gonna be fun.
[03:33:43.687 --> 03:33:46.269]  It'll roll it out that way, oh, but it won't last.
[03:33:46.994 --> 03:33:47.614]  Here's a funny one.
[03:33:47.795 --> 03:33:52.878]  Automakers invest heavily in electronic vehicles despite still low demand.
[03:33:53.718 --> 03:33:55.319]  And that on the heels of a new study coming out.
[03:33:55.699 --> 03:33:58.921]  Electronic cars emit more CO2 than diesel vehicles.
[03:33:59.822 --> 03:34:02.523]  But it's just the left in a nutshell.
[03:34:03.944 --> 03:34:07.947]  Give you something that you don't want for a price that you can't afford.
[03:34:08.939 --> 03:34:09.980]  That's just what they do.
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:13.864]  All right, we've got open phone lines now and the callers are ready to go.
[03:34:13.904 --> 03:34:16.027]  Let's start with Margaret calling in from Oklahoma.
[03:34:16.067 --> 03:34:17.108]  Thanks for calling today, Margaret.
[03:34:17.148 --> 03:34:17.488]  Go ahead.
[03:34:19.551 --> 03:34:22.113]  I've actually called in before about Schaefer-Cox.
[03:34:22.774 --> 03:34:22.994]  Okay.
[03:34:23.775 --> 03:34:27.940]  And I think you said one time that you really, really wanted to help Schaefer-Cox.
[03:34:28.916 --> 03:34:29.897]  Well, I just think it's sad.
[03:34:29.917 --> 03:34:35.021]  I mean, Schaefer Cox is an American patriot who was jailed illegally, in my opinion.
[03:34:35.742 --> 03:34:38.424]  And yeah, he just kind of rots in a jail cell.
[03:34:38.484 --> 03:34:42.027]  And I haven't really seen or heard much from or about him lately.
[03:34:44.177 --> 03:34:49.539]  Jordan Page, he's a singer-songwriter, and he has a fantastic voice.
[03:34:49.859 --> 03:34:52.080]  He wrote a song for Schaefer Cox.
[03:34:52.180 --> 03:34:53.760]  It's right there on YouTube.
[03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:59.041]  Just look up The Persecution of Schaefer Cox, Jordan Page, and it's a really beautiful song.
[03:35:00.742 --> 03:35:02.643]  Okay, we will look into that.
[03:35:02.663 --> 03:35:04.003]  Anything else, Margaret?
[03:35:04.063 --> 03:35:09.164]  Yeah, you should get Jordan Page and Anthony Clemons on to talk about Schaefer.
[03:35:09.464 --> 03:35:11.165]  They would love to do that.
[03:35:12.734 --> 03:35:14.815]  Okay, well, we will look into that, Margaret.
[03:35:14.835 --> 03:35:16.536]  Thank you so much for the call.
[03:35:17.036 --> 03:35:20.138]  Let's go to... Alright, let's just do this right now.
[03:35:20.458 --> 03:35:23.560]  Let's go to Jay calling in from Texas.
[03:35:23.600 --> 03:35:24.140]  Go ahead, Jay.
[03:35:26.321 --> 03:35:27.682]  Yo, old dog, what up?
[03:35:28.402 --> 03:35:29.503]  Yo, what's up, Jay?
[03:35:31.163 --> 03:35:31.864]  Not much.
[03:35:31.904 --> 03:35:32.884]  I'm a second-time caller.
[03:35:32.924 --> 03:35:35.185]  I called before I talked to David.
[03:35:35.806 --> 03:35:36.666]  Really articulate.
[03:35:37.006 --> 03:35:38.367]  I love him.
[03:35:38.587 --> 03:35:42.149]  I just wanted to give you props real quick for your veteran show.
[03:35:42.965 --> 03:35:43.786]  It really helps me.
[03:35:43.886 --> 03:35:44.747]  It really touches me.
[03:35:45.848 --> 03:35:50.752]  You had me rolling earlier, bro, when you were talking about Brian Stelter and that fence, man.
[03:35:51.032 --> 03:35:53.434]  Brian Stelter's actually going to be joining us again in the next segment.
[03:35:53.934 --> 03:35:59.198]  But, Jay, let me just say, the fact that that Veterans Call-In Show is important to you means everything.
[03:35:59.238 --> 03:36:00.019]  That's why I do it.
[03:36:00.459 --> 03:36:03.122]  And we actually have it this Friday, the Veterans Show.
[03:36:03.162 --> 03:36:05.163]  We do it the last Friday of every month on The War Room.
[03:36:05.824 --> 03:36:09.487]  In case any of the audience is not aware, the last Friday of the month on The War Room
[03:36:10.007 --> 03:36:10.527]  3 to 6 p.m.
[03:36:10.547 --> 03:36:11.648]  Central here hosted by me.
[03:36:12.328 --> 03:36:16.249]  We do a veterans call-in show and I've got multiple veterans lined up for this Friday.
[03:36:16.289 --> 03:36:20.030]  We always get great veterans guests on to co-host and then we get great calls.
[03:36:21.051 --> 03:36:28.253]  So it's something that I'm always excited about and when I hear the veterans call me and say, hey, that's I love that you do that.
[03:36:28.293 --> 03:36:29.093]  That's what it's all about.
[03:36:30.874 --> 03:36:31.674]  Oh, yeah, no doubt.
[03:36:32.094 --> 03:36:37.536]  So yeah, I be praying for you the whole InfoWars crew a lot that dude you be out there.
[03:36:38.246 --> 03:36:39.827]  All in like the midst of it.
[03:36:40.007 --> 03:36:41.167]  With a red cap on?
[03:36:41.487 --> 03:36:43.468]  I mean, I haven't been stateside in a long time.
[03:36:43.528 --> 03:36:45.108]  I've been overseas working.
[03:36:45.568 --> 03:36:47.649]  But, so I don't know the state, what's going on.
[03:36:47.709 --> 03:36:48.309]  I'm your age.
[03:36:48.929 --> 03:36:51.310]  But for you to be out there, you're so brave.
[03:36:51.370 --> 03:36:53.310]  I saw you last year at South by Southwest.
[03:36:53.350 --> 03:36:56.271]  I think you interviewed Michael 5,000 Watts from Swisher House.
[03:36:56.371 --> 03:36:59.012]  And I'm like, oh my God, because South of the Houston area,
[03:36:59.696 --> 03:37:01.677]  And I'm like, he's just walking up there with a camera crew.
[03:37:01.697 --> 03:37:02.798]  Do you have, like, 10 bodyguards?
[03:37:02.818 --> 03:37:03.478]  You're not worried?
[03:37:03.638 --> 03:37:05.879]  You're like a colonel for the Info Wars team.
[03:37:06.119 --> 03:37:07.700]  Then you got, like, Mike Adams, the health guy.
[03:37:07.740 --> 03:37:09.421]  He's like the general, David, their general.
[03:37:09.601 --> 03:37:14.183]  I'm not trying to down your rank, but, I mean, we're all trying to fight this war.
[03:37:14.483 --> 03:37:15.864]  But you're not scared out there?
[03:37:15.884 --> 03:37:16.924]  Do you have a vest on?
[03:37:19.025 --> 03:37:22.787]  No, I, in fact, most of the time now, I go out totally solo.
[03:37:23.748 --> 03:37:25.008]  I'm protected by God.
[03:37:25.849 --> 03:37:26.469]  So I have no fear.
[03:37:28.752 --> 03:37:29.012]  All right.
[03:37:29.413 --> 03:37:29.653]  All right.
[03:37:29.773 --> 03:37:31.634]  I mean, Jay, you know what I'm saying?
[03:37:31.915 --> 03:37:40.402]  Your prayers, we have people that they do, they do like weird devil satanic rituals and they try to send demons on us, man.
[03:37:40.942 --> 03:37:42.083]  Your prayers counter that.
[03:37:42.203 --> 03:37:45.526]  Your prayers keep us in God's watchful eye.
[03:37:47.167 --> 03:37:48.368]  Yeah, no doubt.
[03:37:48.868 --> 03:37:49.269]  Every day.
[03:37:49.929 --> 03:37:50.650]  Um, yeah.
[03:37:50.690 --> 03:37:54.453]  So, uh, next, uh, with Savannah Hernandez, the first time I saw you and her,
[03:37:55.746 --> 03:37:56.506]  I don't think so.
[03:38:11.832 --> 03:38:17.879]  It's everywhere, and it's like a magic spell to have you thinking, dancing, twerking, twerking, money, money, dollars, materials.
[03:38:17.919 --> 03:38:19.460]  No, but see, but that's what it is, Jay.
[03:38:19.781 --> 03:38:23.725]  And they use people like Cardi B, and they force-feed her to the population.
[03:38:23.745 --> 03:38:27.149]  And so kids think it's cool, you know, she's rich and famous and everything.
[03:38:27.649 --> 03:38:28.590]  And she's an adult.
[03:38:28.691 --> 03:38:29.451]  She's a moron.
[03:38:29.491 --> 03:38:30.132]  She has a low IQ.
[03:38:31.073 --> 03:38:32.414]  And so, but it doesn't matter.
[03:38:32.434 --> 03:38:33.654]  I mean, she can be good at music or whatever.
[03:38:33.674 --> 03:38:45.578]  The point is, they force-feed people like her for public consumption because that's what they want young people to be looking up to, young people to idolize, is someone who's totally fake and has a low IQ.
[03:38:45.698 --> 03:38:48.579]  It's bad.
[03:38:48.619 --> 03:38:49.199]  We're doomed.
[03:38:50.100 --> 03:38:56.922]  And yeah, so I haven't listened to rap music in a while, just like Bob Marley or some like classical stuff.
[03:38:57.512 --> 03:39:02.113]  But, uh, the next thing, what I really call for is, um, I always hear you beating up vegans, man.
[03:39:02.133 --> 03:39:03.074]  All the time.
[03:39:03.154 --> 03:39:03.854]  Now, hold on a second.
[03:39:03.934 --> 03:39:06.235]  I saw the thing you said you wanted to defend vegans.
[03:39:06.375 --> 03:39:07.475]  I don't beat up vegans.
[03:39:07.535 --> 03:39:08.915]  What are you talking about?
[03:39:09.616 --> 03:39:12.496]  I'm a hardcore InfoWars dude, bro.
[03:39:12.537 --> 03:39:14.617]  You make jokes about us at the supermarket.
[03:39:15.037 --> 03:39:17.038]  You joke about the cow farts.
[03:39:17.598 --> 03:39:19.299]  You jokey joke all the time.
[03:39:19.879 --> 03:39:20.299]  You guys, uh...
[03:39:22.004 --> 03:39:23.524]  It's too much joking about it.
[03:39:23.765 --> 03:39:26.385]  And the thing is, it's serious, sustainability-wise.
[03:39:26.825 --> 03:39:31.626]  I mean, we don't have enough land on Earth to feed the animals and feed the humans.
[03:39:31.947 --> 03:39:35.507]  Sooner or later, unless you're a millionaire, you're not going to be able to eat no filet mignon.
[03:39:35.647 --> 03:39:39.508]  Hey, hey, look, Jay, Jay, I don't know what you're talking about me attacking vegans.
[03:39:39.528 --> 03:39:40.429]  I mean, I've covered it before.
[03:39:40.449 --> 03:39:41.509]  I've made jokes about it.
[03:39:41.609 --> 03:39:42.729]  I understand where you're coming from.
[03:39:42.809 --> 03:39:43.869]  I'm not anti-vegans.
[03:39:43.889 --> 03:39:45.470]  I mean, I've covered events.
[03:39:46.370 --> 03:39:47.451]  Yeah, you're good then.
[03:39:47.611 --> 03:39:48.252]  You're clear.
[03:39:48.492 --> 03:39:49.053]  My last thing.
[03:40:14.898 --> 03:40:19.166]  And I want Alex to hear this, is you guys are killing me with this news.
[03:40:19.467 --> 03:40:21.391]  It's news, news, news all day.
[03:40:21.651 --> 03:40:23.475]  I know that's what you are, your news channel.
[03:40:23.715 --> 03:40:24.898]  But I support InfoWars.
[03:40:24.938 --> 03:40:26.541]  I can't buy InfoWars stock.
[03:40:27.088 --> 03:40:37.234]  I see where you guys are going with the company, I like it, but there should be like music videos, there should be like a cooking channel, there should be like an Infowars team channel, there should be like a full TV show.
[03:40:37.435 --> 03:40:39.015]  You know Jay, I hear you.
[03:40:39.136 --> 03:40:44.719]  I actually hear you and we're on the same page and obviously the challenge is, you know, it takes a lot of money to do that.
[03:40:44.839 --> 03:40:48.962]  It takes a lot of money to expand and to hire the crew and Alex doesn't like half-assing things.
[03:40:49.842 --> 03:40:53.005]  He wants to make sure that we have a full rollout before we do these things.
[03:40:53.025 --> 03:40:59.210]  But like, when I started seeing like flat earthers getting banned from YouTube, I was like, let's have a flat earth channel of InfoWars.
[03:40:59.230 --> 03:41:00.431]  Just bring them all on InfoWars.
[03:41:00.451 --> 03:41:01.612]  I don't care if you're flat earth or not.
[03:41:01.652 --> 03:41:02.292]  It doesn't matter to me.
[03:41:02.573 --> 03:41:03.373]  I'm for free speech.
[03:41:03.754 --> 03:41:05.235]  So I see where you're going.
[03:41:05.255 --> 03:41:06.576]  And I agree with you.
[03:41:06.616 --> 03:41:09.398]  And I know that Alex has a big vision for InfoWars.
[03:41:10.039 --> 03:41:13.742]  And so if we continue to get the support, Jay, I appreciate your support and your prayers.
[03:41:14.222 --> 03:41:18.186]  I mean, if we continue to do that, eventually that's where InfoWars will go.
[03:41:18.666 --> 03:41:22.970]  It just takes time and funding, and so that's kind of the process we're engaged in right now.
[03:41:23.350 --> 03:41:38.004]  And they know that, and that's why they're doing this whole big censorship thing before the 2020 election, because it's during the election cycles where we get the most support, we get the most funding, we get the biggest audience, and people are going to be looking for us again on YouTube and everything, and they're not going to find us.
[03:41:38.404 --> 03:41:38.744]  Nah, that's it man.
[03:41:38.764 --> 03:41:40.605]  I appreciate talking to you until I can crush you up on the court.
[03:42:02.771 --> 03:42:03.751]  But y'all be easy, man.
[03:42:03.791 --> 03:42:04.872]  Like I said, I'm praying for y'all.
[03:42:05.252 --> 03:42:06.112]  And just be safe, man.
[03:42:06.132 --> 03:42:07.213]  Get you another bodyguard.
[03:42:07.233 --> 03:42:09.514]  At least get a thin Teflon, bro.
[03:42:09.614 --> 03:42:10.934]  Are you from Houston?
[03:42:12.635 --> 03:42:13.655]  I'm from south of Houston.
[03:42:13.915 --> 03:42:14.396]  South of Houston?
[03:42:14.416 --> 03:42:15.236]  I don't blame Houston, though.
[03:42:15.776 --> 03:42:16.256]  Alright.
[03:42:17.397 --> 03:42:17.577]  Yeah.
[03:42:17.677 --> 03:42:18.417]  Maybe one day.
[03:42:18.497 --> 03:42:20.258]  Maybe one day we can ball together.
[03:42:21.298 --> 03:42:23.140]  I will meet you at one of these rallies one of these days.
[03:42:23.160 --> 03:42:24.901]  I'm just over here trying to... Come on out!
[03:42:24.941 --> 03:42:25.522]  Hey, come on out!
[03:42:25.542 --> 03:42:29.505]  We've got the Planned Parenthood protest on May 26th coming up.
[03:42:30.086 --> 03:42:31.227]  Thank you so much for the call, Jay.
[03:42:31.747 --> 03:42:32.528]  It's great to hear from you.
[03:42:33.028 --> 03:42:35.450]  On May 26th, we have the Planned Parenthood protest.
[03:42:35.470 --> 03:42:37.012]  Stop government funding of Planned Parenthood.
[03:42:37.052 --> 03:42:39.294]  May 26th, in Austin, Texas.
[03:42:40.435 --> 03:42:41.696]  The Planned Parenthood Center on 7th Street.
[03:42:44.989 --> 03:42:49.493]  Migrating from the one on Ben White to the one on 7th Street, which is more downtown.
[03:42:49.553 --> 03:42:50.734]  They get free rent from our government.
[03:42:51.394 --> 03:42:52.435]  So join me out there, Jay.
[03:42:52.455 --> 03:42:53.175]  I'd love to meet you.
[03:42:53.356 --> 03:42:58.600]  I always love meeting fellow InfoWarriors when I host these events and these protests.
[03:42:58.900 --> 03:42:59.420]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:59.460 --> 03:43:02.443]  Final segment on the other side.
[03:43:02.623 --> 03:43:03.964]  I've got a big announcement to make.
[03:43:04.324 --> 03:43:06.366]  We've got four or five positions.
[03:43:10.503 --> 03:43:11.063]  We're good to go.
[03:43:30.128 --> 03:43:32.269]  There's a lot of new secret projects going on.
[03:43:32.510 --> 03:43:40.915]  The point is, if you want to build freedom in this country, and promote free speech, and you want to help InfoWars go to the next level, we want to hire you.
[03:43:40.955 --> 03:43:44.658]  Send your resumes to techjobs at InfoWars.com today.

[03:45:04.795 --> 03:45:06.896]  Brian in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:45:07.036 --> 03:45:13.361]  Yeah, so real quickly, you know, I own the Alexa Pure Pro because I love my neighbor, but I refuse to drink their heart medication.
[03:45:13.381 --> 03:45:21.126]  Well water is some of the most polluted stuff in the country, because you got glyphosate, you got all your neighbor's medications that they're putting into a septic tank.
[03:45:21.286 --> 03:45:23.367]  That then goes into the groundwater and you drink it.
[03:45:23.427 --> 03:45:25.729]  So absolutely, the number one thing anybody can do.
[03:45:26.009 --> 03:45:27.430]  And by the way, I forget to do this to get mad.
[03:45:27.850 --> 03:45:31.652]  When I drink filtered water, when I take the supplements, my life's so much better.
[03:45:31.993 --> 03:45:36.335]  When I forget, because I'm not Mr. Frickin' Health, I feel it.
[03:45:36.355 --> 03:45:39.477]  So yes, tell me about not wanting to drink your neighbor's heart medication.
[03:45:39.537 --> 03:45:51.945]  Well, where I live, and I think this is the same story for most of the country, our water filtration is based on a reverse osmosis system that was constructed around the turn of the century, and I have zero, zero faith
[03:45:54.086 --> 03:45:58.427]  Well, look at Flint, Michigan.
[03:45:58.587 --> 03:46:02.489]  Their water is full of lead, mercury, poisons, E. coli.
[03:46:02.749 --> 03:46:06.490]  The answer is, everyone, if you're drinking water, you should filter it.
[03:46:06.650 --> 03:46:07.811]  And I'll never forget David Hogg.
[03:46:08.291 --> 03:46:11.452]  He goes, you know Alex Jones on C-SPAN, he goes, little anti-gun guy.
[03:46:11.572 --> 03:46:16.334]  He goes, he says the water has toxins and then he sells a water filter.
[03:46:16.514 --> 03:46:24.597]  Yeah, it's like saying your kids need vitamin C and then I sell vitamin C. Or, Jones says we need to wear shoes.
[03:46:24.817 --> 03:46:25.817]  We walk in the snow.
[03:46:26.237 --> 03:46:27.458]  Then he advertises shoes.
[03:46:27.658 --> 03:46:28.558]  Yes, exactly.
[03:46:28.878 --> 03:46:30.299]  But see, in his little brain...
[03:46:30.919 --> 03:46:32.359]  Where everything is a scam.
[03:46:32.840 --> 03:46:35.680]  He thinks I'm scamming people when it's a direct sale.
[03:46:35.820 --> 03:46:37.421]  We have the best gravity-fed systems.
[03:46:37.481 --> 03:46:40.082]  Alexa Pure and Pro Pure are apples and oranges, but they're both excellent.
[03:46:40.262 --> 03:46:41.082]  Everyone needs it.
[03:46:41.262 --> 03:46:42.482]  Everyone should filter their water.
[03:46:42.502 --> 03:46:43.883]  This is the smartest thing you can do.
[03:46:43.903 --> 03:46:46.003]  It doesn't mean occasionally you don't drink some ice tea at a restaurant.
[03:46:46.044 --> 03:46:47.764]  But you need to filter your water.
[03:46:47.884 --> 03:46:49.324]  Your skin is your biggest organ.
[03:46:49.384 --> 03:46:50.405]  You absorb it there.
[03:46:50.545 --> 03:46:53.166]  You need filters on your shower or your bath.
[03:46:53.506 --> 03:46:54.226]  Exactly.
[03:46:54.326 --> 03:46:56.106]  And then you look at what's in the water table.
[03:46:56.267 --> 03:46:57.347]  It's insane!
[03:47:06.162 --> 03:47:17.432]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.612 --> 03:47:23.036]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:47:24.257 --> 03:47:31.663]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:31.683 --> 03:47:34.646]  This is Brian Stelter filling in.
[03:47:36.545 --> 03:47:44.050]  I'm kind of sick of having no audience on CNN, so I decided to actually have an audience and fill in for Alex here in the last segment.
[03:47:44.270 --> 03:47:47.952]  And I just have to raise a big fuss about something here.
[03:47:49.053 --> 03:47:55.157]  You see, Trump avoiding the Correspondents' Dinner is an attack on the media.
[03:47:56.098 --> 03:47:56.618]  I'm attacked.
[03:47:57.278 --> 03:48:00.901]  I am being attacked daily by President Trump when he refuses to give me an interview.
[03:48:01.481 --> 03:48:05.304]  I am being attacked daily by President Trump when he says we need to have a border.
[03:48:06.243 --> 03:48:12.307]  These are the kind of racist, bigoted statements from President Trump that we fight every day here at CNN.
[03:48:12.467 --> 03:48:13.688]  But we have no audience left.
[03:48:14.368 --> 03:48:14.849]  We failed.
[03:48:14.969 --> 03:48:16.390]  We've lost all our audience.
[03:48:16.910 --> 03:48:20.172]  And so I now have to come on InfoWars because we have no audience.
[03:48:20.813 --> 03:48:32.140]  But for the President to avoid us at the Correspondents' Dinner, where we want to tar and feather him publicly, where we want to lie about him to the American people, when we want to destroy and attack him, that's our right.
[03:48:32.681 --> 03:48:33.681]  It's in the Constitution.
[03:48:34.342 --> 03:48:35.863]  Read the Constitution, Mr. President.
[03:48:36.984 --> 03:48:49.954]  It says in the Bill of Rights, written in 1692 by Malcolm X, that the President has to go to the Correspondents' Dinner.
[03:48:50.134 --> 03:48:51.555]  If he doesn't, he's guilty of treason.
[03:48:51.995 --> 03:48:52.776]  It's in the Bill of Rights.
[03:48:53.496 --> 03:49:03.584]  And so now, the President is openly committing treason against this Republic by refusing to let us ridicule him and lie about him during the Correspondents' Dinner.
[03:49:03.624 --> 03:49:05.846]  So, it's an attack against the media.
[03:49:06.937 --> 03:49:11.581]  It's an attack against me that the President will avoid us at the Correspondents' Dinner.
[03:49:11.741 --> 03:49:14.623]  And it really just goes to show you who the President really is.
[03:49:15.804 --> 03:49:17.626]  He's too busy fixing the economy.
[03:49:18.266 --> 03:49:20.768]  We just had another record-breaking day in the stock market.
[03:49:21.269 --> 03:49:22.890]  This is what the President chooses to do?
[03:49:23.270 --> 03:49:24.591]  Record low unemployment numbers?
[03:49:25.172 --> 03:49:29.355]  This is what the President is doing with his time instead of going to the Correspondents' Dinner?
[03:49:30.236 --> 03:49:32.558]  I think that really shows you who this President is.
[03:49:34.199 --> 03:49:34.880]  Anti-American.
[03:49:36.363 --> 03:49:41.445]  He wants to support the American people instead of the fake news media that hates him and attacks him every day.
[03:49:42.465 --> 03:49:43.546]  It's an assault against me.
[03:49:44.846 --> 03:49:45.627]  So I sign off.
[03:49:46.067 --> 03:49:50.909]  I'm gonna go have to put some ice on my wounds from all the attacks I've had to endure from the President.
[03:49:51.869 --> 03:49:54.190]  And I'm going to get a fresh box of Kleenexes as well.
[03:49:54.990 --> 03:49:59.812]  So for InfoWars.com, this has been Brian Pennywise Stelter, the biggest audience I've ever had.
[03:50:01.553 --> 03:50:03.153]  Thank you for filling in there, Brian.
[03:50:03.653 --> 03:50:04.654]  Very nice of you to do so.
[03:50:07.728 --> 03:50:09.209]  You know, CNN is such a joke.
[03:50:10.931 --> 03:50:11.751]  They tweeted this out.
[03:50:13.372 --> 03:50:19.217]  Shaima Ismail was attending a conference of the Islamic Circle of North America in D.C.
[03:50:19.297 --> 03:50:23.320]  when she saw a group of protesters holding signs against the Muslim faith.
[03:50:26.062 --> 03:50:35.610]  She asked her friend to take a photo of her in front of them, so she's trolling them, but I looked at the signs, and all the signs say is that they love Jesus.
[03:50:37.250 --> 03:50:40.632]  But I guess if you love Jesus, that's somehow an attack on the Muslim's faith.
[03:50:42.594 --> 03:50:51.039]  Why doesn't CNN, you know what, we need to do a new CNN logo, and let's just like put a hijab on the CNN logo.
[03:50:52.560 --> 03:50:59.385]  I mean, we did the CNN is ISIS thing, so CNN is ISIS, but CNN is now just openly Muslim.
[03:51:00.846 --> 03:51:01.787]  And there's nothing wrong with that.
[03:51:02.679 --> 03:51:05.440]  So we should just put the hijab over the CNN logo.
[03:51:05.820 --> 03:51:06.960]  Alright, final segment here.
[03:51:08.360 --> 03:51:09.520]  Let's take a couple more phone calls.
[03:51:09.560 --> 03:51:12.321]  Let's go to Brad Chadford calling in here.
[03:51:12.381 --> 03:51:14.381]  Chard Bratwurst in Boston.
[03:51:14.401 --> 03:51:14.681]  Go ahead.
[03:51:16.122 --> 03:51:20.002]  Hey man, I gotta say your stelter impression is not quite high enough.
[03:51:20.803 --> 03:51:21.323]  Impression?
[03:51:21.343 --> 03:51:22.183]  What are you talking about?
[03:51:23.223 --> 03:51:24.083]  Stelter impression?
[03:51:24.123 --> 03:51:27.384]  You should have Morales go in there and grab you by the chode while you do that.
[03:51:27.464 --> 03:51:30.825]  Because I think that would get it up another octave.
[03:51:30.945 --> 03:51:32.385]  You're a disgusting person, you know that?
[03:51:33.266 --> 03:51:34.527]  I really am, but you know what?
[03:51:34.907 --> 03:51:36.509]  That's not what I really wanted to talk about.
[03:51:36.549 --> 03:51:39.651]  What I wanted to get into is I actually have breaking news.
[03:51:39.811 --> 03:51:44.115]  I called Her Handsome Cafe in Australia.
[03:51:44.555 --> 03:51:45.996]  Wait, you called them on the phone?
[03:51:46.016 --> 03:51:47.017]  To discuss the gender surcharge.
[03:51:47.297 --> 03:51:47.858]  Yeah, I did.
[03:51:47.878 --> 03:51:51.681]  To discuss their 18% gender surcharge on men.
[03:51:51.761 --> 03:51:52.001]  Yes.
[03:51:52.782 --> 03:52:00.608]  And they actually told me that they were rethinking it, and they were going to allow you and
[03:52:01.095 --> 03:52:04.758]  Marcos Morales to get an 18% discount.
[03:52:04.778 --> 03:52:09.863]  They're actually calling it the whole discharge, not the gender surcharge.
[03:52:10.643 --> 03:52:17.209]  So I guess their thing is it's by women for women, but they said this one is by women for Owen.
[03:52:17.750 --> 03:52:20.412]  Well, here's their problem, though.
[03:52:20.432 --> 03:52:21.053]  Here's their problem.
[03:52:21.843 --> 03:52:23.044]  I've already outflanked them.
[03:52:23.645 --> 03:52:26.267]  I was planning on going to get coffee there as a woman.
[03:52:26.668 --> 03:52:33.034]  So you see, I was gonna identify as a woman, and then they couldn't give me the surcharge, otherwise that would be sexist, you see?
[03:52:33.054 --> 03:52:36.197]  Do differently to appear as a woman.
[03:52:37.475 --> 03:52:39.537]  Well, I mean, I showed the video of Drag Queen Storia.
[03:52:39.597 --> 03:52:42.861]  I mean, these guys have big hairy chests and big burly beards.
[03:52:42.881 --> 03:52:44.282]  I mean, they don't even really try to be women.
[03:52:44.322 --> 03:52:49.828]  So I'm just going to claim to be a woman, and I'm going to go get a cup of coffee and avoid that surcharge.
[03:52:50.208 --> 03:52:52.350]  And if they say that I'm a man, then they're sexist.
[03:52:53.331 --> 03:52:55.493]  Yeah, but you and Marcos get the whole discharge now.
[03:52:56.254 --> 03:52:56.995]  It's 18% off.
[03:52:57.636 --> 03:52:58.577]  So I think it's a good deal.
[03:52:59.458 --> 03:53:00.138]  So here's the deal.
[03:53:02.708 --> 03:53:08.692]  You can make your jokes here on the Alex Jones Show, but, you know, the liberals aren't going to go to your channel, Brad.
[03:53:10.594 --> 03:53:12.435]  Well, they don't anyway, so what does it matter?
[03:53:12.455 --> 03:53:13.236]  I've got nothing to lose.
[03:53:13.256 --> 03:53:22.722]  You're actually smarter than the rest because you're actually taking advantage of the Trump economy because, I mean, there's nothing... the liberals, they won't... they won't... they don't know what to do.
[03:53:24.384 --> 03:53:25.304]  Yeah, I guess not.
[03:53:25.424 --> 03:53:25.845]  I guess not.
[03:53:25.885 --> 03:53:29.868]  Hey, I'm going to let you go because I know you want to get a couple more calls in, but Tulsi, 2020.
[03:53:29.908 --> 03:53:30.348]  See you later.
[03:53:32.082 --> 03:53:39.127]  Yeah, you know, Tulsi is going hard against Saudi Arabia and our funding of their crimes against humanity.
[03:53:39.627 --> 03:53:42.629]  I support Tulsi in that challenge.
[03:53:42.669 --> 03:53:45.491]  I just don't think she's going to get any support from the Democrats.
[03:53:45.531 --> 03:53:48.473]  I think they want Biden, and so they're going to get Biden.
[03:53:49.194 --> 03:53:55.118]  So unfortunately, Tulsi Gabbard, by far the best candidate the Democrats have to offer, I don't think she's going to get a fair shot.
[03:53:55.398 --> 03:53:56.418]  All right, let's take another call here.
[03:53:56.438 --> 03:53:56.999]  Let's go to
[03:53:59.000 --> 03:54:00.021]  Let's do Emerson.
[03:54:00.041 --> 03:54:01.682]  Let's take another caller from Massachusetts today.
[03:54:01.722 --> 03:54:02.342]  Go ahead, Emerson.
[03:54:07.364 --> 03:54:08.325]  Five seconds, Emerson.
[03:54:08.345 --> 03:54:08.785]  Are you with us?
[03:54:08.825 --> 03:54:09.366]  Go ahead, yes.
[03:54:10.226 --> 03:54:11.066]  Hey, how's it going?
[03:54:11.427 --> 03:54:12.147]  Good, thanks for calling.
[03:54:12.167 --> 03:54:13.528]  Alright, welcome.
[03:54:13.588 --> 03:54:16.229]  Greetings to AJ.
[03:54:16.249 --> 03:54:17.610]  I haven't heard from you in a while.
[03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:18.851]  I'm sorry, what was that?
[03:54:20.111 --> 03:54:21.552]  Greetings to AJ, it's Alex Jones.
[03:54:22.392 --> 03:54:24.393]  I haven't heard from you in a while.
[03:54:26.955 --> 03:54:27.215]  Okay.
[03:54:28.442 --> 03:54:32.766]  So I'm calling today just to... I'm going to be brief because I'm actually working.
[03:54:34.267 --> 03:54:45.537]  So I just wanted to say that the felons who commit a crime and they're in jail, they should have no rights.
[03:54:46.778 --> 03:54:49.340]  They should have rights to have no rights, basically.
[03:54:49.360 --> 03:54:50.081]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:54:50.612 --> 03:54:56.794]  Well, I look at this issue and I just see it as the Democrats trying to scrape up as many votes as they can.
[03:54:56.834 --> 03:55:00.215]  They know that their party is dying, and so they see six million felons.
[03:55:00.815 --> 03:55:02.796]  There's six million votes that they think they can get.
[03:55:03.056 --> 03:55:06.137]  But this is like the least radical thing the Democrats are pushing right now.
[03:55:06.157 --> 03:55:12.399]  I mean, open borders, free education, tear down every skyscraper, illegals voting.
[03:55:12.459 --> 03:55:16.700]  I mean, having felons vote, that's like lukewarm for a Democrat.
[03:55:17.759 --> 03:55:20.843]  They're not a law-abiding citizen, so they should have no rights.
[03:55:21.243 --> 03:55:23.606]  Because they broke the law, that's why they're in jail.
[03:55:24.355 --> 03:55:25.576]  Jail is not a vacation.
[03:55:26.177 --> 03:55:27.819]  They cannot live with a community.
[03:55:29.120 --> 03:55:29.740]  Oh, you know what?
[03:55:29.800 --> 03:55:32.463]  No, Emerson, it's actually making sense to me now.
[03:55:32.663 --> 03:55:33.584]  I see what's happening.
[03:55:34.505 --> 03:55:35.726]  Now I see what's happening.
[03:55:36.387 --> 03:55:38.069]  Now I see the picture.
[03:55:38.569 --> 03:55:46.978]  The Democrats are pushing for felons to vote because they want to be able to vote from jail when Trump arrests them in a few years.
[03:55:47.078 --> 03:55:47.959]  That's what this is.
[03:55:49.179 --> 03:55:52.160]  Obama wants to be able to vote when he's arrested for treason.
[03:55:52.440 --> 03:55:55.541]  Hillary wants to be able to vote from her jail cell when she's a felon.
[03:55:55.821 --> 03:55:57.881]  That's what this is, Emerson.
[03:55:57.941 --> 03:56:01.542]  Thank you for... Emerson, I'm so glad you put that thought bug in my head today.
[03:56:02.222 --> 03:56:02.942]  Thank you for the call.
[03:56:03.042 --> 03:56:03.602]  That's what it is.
[03:56:04.242 --> 03:56:13.084]  The Democrats realize that they're all about to end up in jail as felons and so they're trying to be able to vote from prison once they get locked up for all their treason.
[03:56:13.584 --> 03:56:14.425]  Alright, final call.
[03:56:14.465 --> 03:56:15.665]  Let's go to Jim in Alabama.
[03:56:15.685 --> 03:56:16.185]  Go ahead, Jim.
[03:56:20.783 --> 03:56:25.065]  I've been listening to your show today and I'm uh... Wait a second, hold on.
[03:56:25.125 --> 03:56:27.486]  Has Brian Stelter commandeered Jim?
[03:56:27.506 --> 03:56:29.887]  Yes!
[03:56:29.947 --> 03:56:32.829]  I'm trying to infiltrate the show and try to stop this madness!
[03:56:33.469 --> 03:56:34.630]  You're being a fraud!
[03:56:36.251 --> 03:56:39.933]  Brian, will you leave the InfoWars audience alone please?
[03:56:40.013 --> 03:56:41.954]  We've given you enough air time for one day.
[03:56:41.974 --> 03:56:42.014]  No!
[03:56:42.134 --> 03:56:43.034]  No!
[03:56:43.114 --> 03:56:44.415]  I'm gonna report you to Twitter!
[03:56:44.715 --> 03:56:46.836]  I'm gonna report all your Twitter channels!
[03:56:47.537 --> 03:56:47.957]  And uh...
[03:56:48.879 --> 03:56:56.241]  You're just making CNN look bad!
[03:56:56.261 --> 03:56:58.521]  I don't appreciate it!
[03:56:58.561 --> 03:56:58.721]  No!
[03:57:00.062 --> 03:57:03.222]  No, you're just trying to write on my coattails for your own thing!
[03:57:03.963 --> 03:57:06.403]  InfoWars is trying to use me for their own thing!
[03:57:07.343 --> 03:57:09.664]  I'm the famous celebrity here!
[03:57:13.567 --> 03:57:14.848]  Alright, Brian, I'll tell you what.
[03:57:14.888 --> 03:57:19.770]  Brian Stelter, you did a great job providing this content.
[03:57:20.011 --> 03:57:20.491]  Here's the deal.
[03:57:21.351 --> 03:57:22.732]  Folks, I'm gonna let you in on a secret.
[03:57:22.832 --> 03:57:23.793]  Thanks for calling, Brian.
[03:57:25.433 --> 03:57:30.296]  The real reason why Brian was so upset is because we don't have a t-shirt size in his size.
[03:57:31.156 --> 03:57:32.237]  He's a quadruple XL.
[03:57:33.547 --> 03:57:34.127]  We're gonna do it.
[03:57:34.628 --> 03:57:36.169]  In fact, it's not a quadruple XL.
[03:57:36.249 --> 03:57:43.214]  We're gonna now launch all InfoWars t-shirts are 50% off and we're now announcing the brand new Brian Stelter size.
[03:57:43.874 --> 03:57:46.496]  It's the quadruple XL Brian Stelter size.
[03:57:46.917 --> 03:57:49.178]  So Brian, we're gonna get you that t-shirt.
[03:57:49.218 --> 03:57:50.019]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:54.989 --> 03:57:57.090]  Brian in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:57:57.210 --> 03:58:03.552]  Yeah, so real quickly, you know, I own the Alexa Pure Pro because I love my neighbor, but I refuse to drink their heart medication.
[03:58:03.572 --> 03:58:05.973]  Well water is some of the most polluted stuff in the country.
[03:58:05.993 --> 03:58:11.315]  Because you got glyphosate, you got all your neighbor's medications that they're putting into a septic tank.
[03:58:11.475 --> 03:58:13.576]  That then goes into the groundwater and you drink it.
[03:58:13.636 --> 03:58:15.917]  So absolutely, the number one thing anybody can do.
[03:58:15.937 --> 03:58:17.578]  And by the way, I forget to do this to get mad.
[03:58:18.038 --> 03:58:21.841]  When I drink filtered water, when I take the supplements, my life's so much better.
[03:58:22.182 --> 03:58:26.365]  When I forget, because I'm not Mr. Frickin' Health, I feel it.
[03:58:26.545 --> 03:58:29.648]  So yes, tell me about not wanting to drink your neighbor's heart medication.
[03:58:29.728 --> 03:58:42.159]  Well, where I live, and I think this is the same story for most of the country, our water filtration is based on a reverse osmosis system that was constructed around the turn of the century, and I have zero, zero phase.
[03:58:44.260 --> 03:58:48.642]  Well, look at Flint, Michigan.
[03:58:48.782 --> 03:58:52.644]  Their water is full of lead, mercury, poisons, E. coli.
[03:58:52.944 --> 03:58:56.686]  The answer is, everyone, if you're drinking water, you should filter it.
[03:58:56.826 --> 03:58:58.006]  And I'll never forget David Hogg.
[03:58:58.026 --> 03:58:59.627]  Of course, you know Alex Jones.
