[00:00:30.064 --> 00:00:30.925]  Yeah!

[00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.810]  Yeah!

[00:00:41.697 --> 00:00:43.098]  Make America Great Again!

[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.880]  Thank you!

[00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:27.805]  This is it!
[00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:29.286]  Alex Jones Show!
[00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:32.548]  I don't care, I'm staying right here.
[00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:35.810]  You are the greatest thing ever!
[00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.591]  Thank you!
[00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:41.855]  Wait, I gotta get the Info Wars in it, though.
[00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:42.735]  Is that safe?
[00:01:42.855 --> 00:01:44.937]  Oh yeah, Info Wars!
[00:01:45.517 --> 00:01:46.738]  Gun girl.
[00:01:46.838 --> 00:01:47.759]  Hey, come here.
[00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:48.659]  Info Wars, what's up?
[00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:53.317]  Free Alex Jones!
[00:01:53.717 --> 00:02:06.741]  We appreciate all the work that Alex does, and all Americans do, and I think it's just a shame and a travesty with Facebook, Twitter, and the banks, and I mean, we're living in a fascist country.
[00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:25.473]  I would love to meet Alex Jones.
[00:02:25.753 --> 00:02:29.455]  What would you say to him?
[00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:31.295]  What would I say to Alex Jones?
[00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:33.256]  Where does he come up with his ideas?
[00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:38.678]  Because he honestly says the weirdest things, but some of it does make sense, if you really think about it.
[00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:40.818]  I absolutely love InfoWars.
[00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:42.479]  I've been watching for like 11, 12 years.
[00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.839]  You guys are awesome.
[00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.380]  Thank you.
[00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.060]  He's still there.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.160]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.461]  You can watch his live show on his website.
[00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:52.101]  I miss him so much.
[00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:54.962]  I used to watch him every Tuesday night, so I don't know what happened to him.
[00:02:54.982 --> 00:02:59.463]  Go to InfoWars.com and click on where it says Radio Show and you can watch him every day.
[00:02:59.483 --> 00:03:00.603]  Okay, cool.
[00:03:00.863 --> 00:03:03.683]  We just want to say, hey Alex, wish you were here with us.
[00:03:03.723 --> 00:03:05.624]  Deplorables, come on brother.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:20.829]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.972]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:29.277]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, best-selling author.
[00:03:29.297 --> 00:03:30.197]  He's a really smart guy.
[00:03:31.178 --> 00:03:32.419]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour today.
[00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.624]  Remember when he was on last week when the tankers got blown up and sunk in the Persian Gulf?
[00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:44.429]  And I said, the doctrine is nuclear attack will be launched on Iran, fire and fury.
[00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.051]  And he said, no, no, that's off the table.
[00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.556]  You see, that's why he'd be like a master sergeant, not be a general.
[00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:56.143]  Because I'd done my research and already knew about this before it was even declassified.
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:57.220]  U.S.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.902]  first strike on Russia, Iran, you name it, with nuclear weapons.
[00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:05.265]  The Dr. Strangelove policy from the 1960s brought back.
[00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:08.747]  This has actually changed under Obama, under Hillary's advice.
[00:04:09.588 --> 00:04:12.109]  I got that from high-level folks involved with the nuclear weapons.
[00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.390]  I've told you that on air.
[00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.471]  Iran has nuclear weapons, by the way.
[00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:16.312]  I told you that on air.
[00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:18.073]  Saudi Arabia has nuclear weapons.
[00:04:18.093 --> 00:04:18.993]  This is all confirmed now.
[00:04:19.974 --> 00:04:20.534]  And here it is.
[00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.535]  They released this on June 11th.
[00:04:23.584 --> 00:04:25.525]  They pulled it two days later and reclassified it.
[00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:27.786]  Here it is, the classified document.
[00:04:28.446 --> 00:04:29.807]  Nuclear Operations Manual.
[00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:32.448]  We have a right to know about this.
[00:04:32.468 --> 00:04:33.348]  I already know about it.
[00:04:33.368 --> 00:04:34.629]  I'm going to tell you all about it.
[00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.210]  Now why is that important?
[00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.951]  The Iranians admit to shooting down a U.S.
[00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:39.571]  Navy drone.
[00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:42.993]  Trump is vowing retaliation, saying Iran made a very big mistake.
[00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:45.714]  It's a broadcast you might not want to miss today.
[00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:47.385]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:48.646]  This is the InfoWars.
[00:04:48.986 --> 00:04:50.027]  InfoWars.com.
[00:04:50.388 --> 00:04:51.369]  NewsWars.com.
[00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:53.091]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:55.093]  We are the real wildcard.
[00:04:55.573 --> 00:04:57.375]  We're the real Ace of Spades.
[00:04:58.036 --> 00:04:59.497]  Fighting for America.
[00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:00.578]  Fighting for freedom.
[00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:01.279]  Fighting for you.
[00:05:07.947 --> 00:05:09.508]  We are in a complete war!
[00:05:09.588 --> 00:05:11.630]  And you idiots don't join with the Republic!
[00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.491]  You fools!
[00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:14.172]  I want them shut down.
[00:05:14.252 --> 00:05:15.173]  I want them silenced.
[00:05:15.193 --> 00:05:15.993]  I want them muted.
[00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:17.895]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:26.462]  But yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[00:05:26.682 --> 00:05:30.145]  President Trump, please save the First Amendment!
[00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:34.226]  Please do the right thing and stand up against hate crime!
[00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.207]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[00:05:37.707 --> 00:05:41.728]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:05:42.168 --> 00:05:43.489]  I want them shut down.
[00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:47.410]  We're losing the thread of the concepts that are important to this country.
[00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.311]  I don't like Alex Jones, but Alex Jones gets to speak.
[00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.671]  Everybody gets to speak.
[00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:53.891]  I'm a bad person!
[00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:54.632]  I question things!
[00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:55.192]  I'm evil!
[00:05:55.312 --> 00:05:55.652]  I don't...
[00:06:00.373 --> 00:06:01.894]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:13.565]  I'm standing up against those that are destroying this country as we speak!
[00:06:14.046 --> 00:06:15.247]  And why am I fired up?
[00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:16.648]  Because this is war!
[00:06:16.988 --> 00:06:20.552]  Absolute, unabated, total war against our nation!
[00:06:22.068 --> 00:06:22.928]  We bring life.
[00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:24.069]  We bring death.
[00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:25.229]  We are men.
[00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:26.050]  We are women.
[00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.150]  We are the humans.
[00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.270]  We are the planet.
[00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:29.711]  We are God's creation.
[00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:30.932]  We are the future.
[00:06:31.132 --> 00:06:31.632]  Not you!
[00:06:32.312 --> 00:06:33.052]  Death!
[00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:34.313]  Death!
[00:06:34.573 --> 00:06:38.174]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:06:38.394 --> 00:06:39.715]  We don't fear death!
[00:06:40.195 --> 00:06:44.317]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:53.500]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you got one!
[00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:17.755]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:19.095]  Death!
[00:07:20.636 --> 00:07:22.778]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:28.521]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:41.469]  Well, to say we've got an important broadcast today would be putting it lightly.
[00:08:00.623 --> 00:08:02.945]  You're a TV viewer, you can see what I have in my hands.
[00:08:07.027 --> 00:08:11.010]  Joint Publication 3-72 Nuclear Operations.
[00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.691]  New Doctrine, June 11, 2019.
[00:08:14.912 --> 00:08:21.476]  For first strike, preemptive nuclear war on Iran, Russia, and China.
[00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.380]  First strike.
[00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:33.739]  Quote, winnable nuclear war, complete psychotic madness.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.140]  End of the world.
[00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:47.747]  Now what do you think Putin was talking about the day after this was released when he said he warned of the end of the world and insanity and saying the U.S.
[00:08:47.807 --> 00:08:49.407]  doesn't even talk to us now.
[00:08:49.948 --> 00:08:57.192]  Trump is so paralyzed by the neocons calling him a Russian agent that no one even talks to the Russians over the red phone now.
[00:08:58.251 --> 00:08:58.971]  There's no discussion.
[00:08:59.952 --> 00:09:04.433]  There's some joint military discussion, but at the highest levels, it's paralyzed.
[00:09:06.714 --> 00:09:08.654]  And the neocons are running wild.
[00:09:08.734 --> 00:09:23.499]  You know, I read in the news, but I don't believe leftist news most of the time, that Tucker Carlson privately warned Trump not to launch war with Iran, and that he's one of the only people talking to the President lengthy amounts every day
[00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.853]  Well, I knew that Tucker talked to the President quite a bit.
[00:09:26.973 --> 00:09:39.296]  I confirmed last night, and I'll leave it at that, that Tucker Carlson and a couple other people, I confirmed from two people, very close to Tucker, about as close as you can get, maybe his wife gets closer.
[00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:51.139]  The point is, is that, is that they are fighting, as we speak, battling in the President's ear.
[00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:53.119]  And the left is kind of pissed!
[00:09:54.735 --> 00:09:57.016]  Their news article's kinda pissed, you know.
[00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:02.639]  If you go to the Daily Beast article, it's got graphics and things making fun of Tucker.
[00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:03.200]  Hey, man!
[00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.761]  Don't get in the way of nuclear war!
[00:10:06.422 --> 00:10:07.942]  Damn conservative piece of filth.
[00:10:10.764 --> 00:10:20.129]  Tucker's also gotten documents that the Koch brothers have been targeting nationalists and patriots for censorship of conservatives and censorship of yours truly.
[00:10:20.429 --> 00:10:21.290]  That's who's behind it.
[00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:23.230]  Yep.
[00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:28.013]  You know, I love how the left always said, Oh, Jones is secretly funded by the Koch brothers.
[00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:38.059]  I even had a few former employees literally behave like schizophrenics to my face and go, I know you're really getting funding from the Koch brothers.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.821]  And I'm like, the Koch brothers used to be Democrats.
[00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:44.964]  They gave more money to Democrats over all the Republicans and they want open borders.
[00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:50.067]  I'm not funded by the Koch brothers or anybody except the listeners.
[00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.231]  The point is, is that he's got a powerful report on that.
[00:10:56.231 --> 00:10:57.551]  I have an overflow of news.
[00:10:58.892 --> 00:11:04.773]  We have exclusive information from inside the NXIVM cult and its conviction and so much more today.
[00:11:08.194 --> 00:11:13.535]  But this is such a big deal on the nuclear weapons doctrine and how it ties into the U.S.
[00:11:13.555 --> 00:11:14.435]  drone being shot down.
[00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:26.716]  Over the Strait of Hormuz and what Iran's doing and the double set of diplomacy, where you've got the neocons and the Democrats basically trying to set Trump up in Iran.
[00:11:28.837 --> 00:11:37.901]  And the Iranians are acting very, very, very bold right now, like they know something we don't know.
[00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:39.582]  Well, I've figured out what's going on.
[00:11:40.462 --> 00:11:42.223]  So I'm going to wait till the start of the next hour.
[00:11:43.023 --> 00:11:44.264]  And then I'm going to get to all this.
[00:11:45.285 --> 00:11:58.715]  Because I have Roger Stone coming on, breaking his silence for the second time, not on the gag order or his court case, but on the NXIVM cult, which he got blamed with saying, oh, Roger Stone spoke to him a few times.
[00:11:58.755 --> 00:11:59.216]  He's part of it.
[00:11:59.736 --> 00:12:01.517]  They had a subcompany try to hire him.
[00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:05.420]  He got in there like a week or so and said, this is a cult, and got out.
[00:12:05.841 --> 00:12:07.222]  He said that here two years ago.
[00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:13.393]  Turns out in the court documents, he was a target of them trying to get at Trump and others.
[00:12:13.493 --> 00:12:15.574]  And of course, obviously yours truly.
[00:12:17.515 --> 00:12:18.716]  And Hillary was involved.
[00:12:18.796 --> 00:12:20.757]  This is all a giant blackmailing scam.
[00:12:21.497 --> 00:12:24.859]  So that's going to be at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:27.560]  He'll be popping in with us here in about 20 minutes.
[00:12:30.582 --> 00:12:35.625]  But the situation with the president
[00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:41.564]  Where he literally only has a couple people telling him, don't listen to Bolton.
[00:12:42.584 --> 00:12:46.485]  And sadly Pompeo is becoming more neoconnish.
[00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:48.405]  And I like Pompeo.
[00:12:49.286 --> 00:12:52.206]  But Bolton is a psychotic.
[00:12:53.146 --> 00:12:57.307]  From the mold of Richard Perle and all the rest of these people.
[00:12:57.587 --> 00:13:00.568]  And Trump is being walked into a setup here.
[00:13:02.028 --> 00:13:04.849]  The Iranians have made double deals before with elements of the Deep State.
[00:13:04.869 --> 00:13:05.889]  They did it against Jimmy Carter.
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.022]  They have pulled these scams before and there are wheels within wheels.
[00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:16.805]  Like I wanted to go into Venezuela to remove the dictator because thousands are dying a week.
[00:13:17.285 --> 00:13:29.032]  But I said we can't because you can't trust the neocons working with the deep state operatives inside the government to set up our troops and set Trump up in an operation a la Bay of Pigs.
[00:13:31.598 --> 00:13:32.338]  Like the Kennedy.
[00:13:33.258 --> 00:13:35.159]  And so, that's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:13:35.299 --> 00:13:38.239]  Iran downs drone ready for war.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.261]  Deep fake photo?
[00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:46.101]  Putin warns USA.
[00:13:46.301 --> 00:13:48.121]  That's the headlines right now.
[00:13:49.222 --> 00:13:52.242]  And the Pentagon's saying that it's a fake video.
[00:13:53.482 --> 00:14:00.964]  They're saying that it was shot down over the Strait of Hormuz, the predator drone, not over Iranian land and airspace.
[00:14:02.099 --> 00:14:04.800]  Service-to-Air Missile taking that down.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:10.061]  And again, the video's posted up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:14:10.101 --> 00:14:13.721]  The Iranian government news agency, Press TV, has released that.
[00:14:14.281 --> 00:14:17.042]  Iran accused of using fake photo to prove U.S.
[00:14:17.062 --> 00:14:19.763]  drone was over its territory as U.S.
[00:14:19.803 --> 00:14:21.083]  slams unprovoked attack.
[00:14:22.463 --> 00:14:24.143]  Trump says they've made a very big mistake.
[00:14:25.424 --> 00:14:27.004]  Iran made a very big mistake, close quote.
[00:14:28.786 --> 00:14:36.189]  Putin's now warning the United States that this could escalate into a wider war, and I'm going to cover that when we come back from break for one segment.
[00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:43.973]  I'm going to really dive into it, and then I'm going to get into this new nuclear first-strike doctrine that's just biblical in its evil and its craziness.
[00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:53.415]  And it's neoconnishness, and it's just total losing the moral high ground, begging other countries to strike us first.
[00:14:54.136 --> 00:14:55.877]  That's exactly what Joel Skousen has been saying.
[00:14:55.897 --> 00:15:03.320]  The globalists have been trying to maneuver for a long, long, long, long time.
[00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:06.062]  So that is all coming up.
[00:15:10.264 --> 00:15:11.665]  So when we return, we'll break it all down.
[00:15:13.015 --> 00:15:14.997]  Please do not forget that we are listener supported.
[00:15:15.037 --> 00:15:16.177]  Without you, we will not be here.
[00:15:16.638 --> 00:15:23.283]  You saw the earlier video at the start of the show where we go to these Trump rallies and 70% of people go, we love Alex Jones, we love InfoWars.
[00:15:23.843 --> 00:15:24.844]  We wish he was still on air.
[00:15:25.745 --> 00:15:27.346]  As the news announced, I was off air.
[00:15:28.747 --> 00:15:32.310]  Off all these dozens and dozens of platforms and people believe it.
[00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.973]  And they don't go to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com.
[00:15:36.253 --> 00:15:38.215]  But you are the smartest part of the audience.
[00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:40.991]  And you know how to get the word out.
[00:15:41.011 --> 00:15:43.093]  So without you, they'll win.
[00:15:43.153 --> 00:15:44.595]  You take action, we will win.
[00:15:44.615 --> 00:15:46.136]  Newswars.com.
[00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:47.437]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:47.478 --> 00:15:53.223]  We are alive and well and stronger than ever in many ways because we've got the most hardcore audience ever.
[00:15:53.263 --> 00:15:56.526]  But we need to expand out to others who don't know the full score.
[00:15:56.807 --> 00:15:57.968]  So tell everyone you know today.
[00:15:58.448 --> 00:15:59.910]  Infowars.com lives.
[00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:00.831]  Pass it on.
[00:16:05.973 --> 00:16:07.634]  Folks, you want people to fight for America.
[00:16:07.994 --> 00:16:09.816]  You want people to stand up and say no to the globalists.
[00:16:10.096 --> 00:16:13.398]  You want people to report on the Clintons and all the pedophile rings that are now in the news.
[00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:17.301]  You want people to, you know, expose globalism or the Islamic invasion.
[00:16:17.541 --> 00:16:19.583]  We're doing it, and we're not backing down.
[00:16:19.723 --> 00:16:22.225]  And we're exposing the Covington hoax first.
[00:16:22.305 --> 00:16:23.125]  We expose it first.
[00:16:23.165 --> 00:16:24.166]  We're exposing it all.
[00:16:24.246 --> 00:16:25.627]  We are the tip of the spear.
[00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:26.448]  You are the tip of the spear.
[00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:32.012]  And that's why everybody has to remember, we're running a Save InfoWars special right now.
[00:16:32.532 --> 00:16:35.294]  To get more capital in because we've not been able to expand.
[00:16:35.314 --> 00:16:37.055]  We've actually been contracting some.
[00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:38.977]  The enemy has been winning with all their attacks.
[00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:47.503]  We're still reaching a lot of people thanks to you, but we need capital to get more reporters in the field, to launch a bunch of stuff we've got ready to do that is going to devastate the globalists.
[00:16:47.663 --> 00:16:49.845]  We've proven we don't talk, we deliver.
[00:16:49.885 --> 00:16:51.706]  But I need war bonds, I need capital.
[00:16:51.846 --> 00:16:53.027]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:16:53.227 --> 00:16:54.248]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:16:55.089 --> 00:16:55.309]  50% off.
[00:16:55.349 --> 00:16:56.450]  Double Patriot points.
[00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.611]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:03.872]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:17:03.892 --> 00:17:15.135]  We've got a bunch of new Made in America shirts with really soft designer fabric and really the highest quality imprints where the shirts are costing us up to $15 a piece and we're selling them on sale for $19.99.
[00:17:15.695 --> 00:17:21.601]  As I've said the other day, and I said to the people in the press, your case is the template case.
[00:17:35.936 --> 00:17:37.597]  For American freedom moving forward.
[00:17:37.958 --> 00:17:46.824]  And whether or not they can break the InfoWars base, whether or not they can stop the InfoWars audience from supporting the InfoWars network.
[00:17:46.864 --> 00:17:53.549]  Because again, like you said in corporate documents, the model of self-funding, self-sales is the thing that corporations, the globalists fear.
[00:17:53.869 --> 00:17:57.892]  Because crowdsourcing and individuals doing this scares the living daylights out of them.
[00:17:58.012 --> 00:17:58.472]  Absolutely.
[00:17:58.492 --> 00:18:02.573]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square.
[00:18:02.673 --> 00:18:14.557]  The other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[00:18:14.697 --> 00:18:27.081]  It is an old-school, American, 1776-style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize
[00:18:27.461 --> 00:18:45.969]  Organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who have been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear and the InfoWars audience has broken through that.
[00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:53.612]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age of ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[00:18:53.973 --> 00:18:58.670]  ...of de-platforming, defamation, lawfare, and libel targeting youth.
[00:19:06.274 --> 00:19:09.095]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:19:09.456 --> 00:19:13.818]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[00:19:13.878 --> 00:19:14.698]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[00:19:14.818 --> 00:19:15.219]  Yes, sir.
[00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:16.499]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:18.420]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.563]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[00:19:24.623 --> 00:19:26.484]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[00:19:26.564 --> 00:19:27.305]  God bless you, brother.
[00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:33.968]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread
[00:19:34.528 --> 00:19:35.629]  You're our only hope, brother.
[00:19:35.749 --> 00:19:37.610]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.691]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[00:20:06.449 --> 00:20:09.066]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:57.677 --> 00:21:04.699]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones back live here broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, June 20th, 2019.
[00:21:06.499 --> 00:21:07.720]  Worldwide broadcast.
[00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.580]  Asked if the U.S.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.580]  will strike Iran.
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.481]  This is just out.
[00:21:12.261 --> 00:21:12.781]  Just breaking.
[00:21:12.821 --> 00:21:14.041]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:21:14.761 --> 00:21:15.442]  NBC News.
[00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:16.882]  CNBC as well is reporting it.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.380]  Asked if the U.S.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.162]  will strike Iran, Trump says you'll soon find out.
[00:21:23.163 --> 00:21:27.786]  President Trump said just minutes ago that he's gonna hold a press conference.
[00:21:28.206 --> 00:21:29.747]  You'll soon find out whether the U.S.
[00:21:29.767 --> 00:21:30.768]  will strike Iran.
[00:21:31.388 --> 00:21:34.310]  As tensions between the two countries ratcheted up, U.S.
[00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:40.935]  officials said earlier in the day that an Iranian missile had shot down an American drone over the Strait of Hormuz.
[00:21:41.435 --> 00:21:43.316]  Iran claimed the drone was above its territory.
[00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:46.859]  Trump tweeted that Iran made a big mistake earlier today.
[00:21:47.399 --> 00:21:48.340]  This is breaking news.
[00:21:50.161 --> 00:22:03.653]  We had the live feeds up on satellite at the White House, so as soon as the President comes out to make an announcement, we'll obviously, we're going to be watching that very closely, we'll obviously cut right to that as this unfolds.
[00:22:05.168 --> 00:22:09.713]  I know President Trump told Tucker Carlson that, you know, don't worry, nothing's going to happen with Iran right now.
[00:22:09.753 --> 00:22:10.814]  He wants to make a peace deal.
[00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:24.350]  But you have Kerry and the Democrats and the neocons bat-channeling, manipulating Iran, telling them to sink ships in the Strait of Hormuz, telling them to be violent towards Trump, and then he'll back down so the nuclear deal can continue on.
[00:22:25.455 --> 00:22:26.776]  They want to embarrass Trump.
[00:22:27.496 --> 00:22:34.521]  I've said over and over again, a war with Iran is what the globalists want, to kill the recovery, suck Russia in, and it may even be a wider war.
[00:22:35.022 --> 00:22:39.365]  Iran has sleeper cells all over the Western world.
[00:22:39.885 --> 00:22:41.446]  Putin warned that the U.S.
[00:22:41.466 --> 00:22:46.230]  military action against Iran would be a catastrophe for the region at a minimum.
[00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.130]  I agree with that.
[00:22:47.971 --> 00:22:54.455]  He added that it would trigger an escalation of hostilities with unpredictable results.
[00:22:55.379 --> 00:22:56.820]  So, there's your headline.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.601]  Putin warns that an attack on Iran by the U.S.
[00:23:00.361 --> 00:23:05.564]  will be a catastrophe at a minimum.
[00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.246]  And you've got the DrudgeReport.com siren going.
[00:23:09.886 --> 00:23:10.846]  Ask if he'll strike Iran.
[00:23:10.866 --> 00:23:12.747]  Trump says you'll soon find out.
[00:23:12.827 --> 00:23:15.829]  Pentagon drum is operating in international airspace.
[00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:19.642]  Oil spikes 6% on this news.
[00:23:20.543 --> 00:23:22.924]  It spiked 2% on the sunken tankers.
[00:23:23.684 --> 00:23:26.165]  So that shows you this is hell on wheels.
[00:23:27.186 --> 00:23:33.529]  You know, I told folks last week this is probably going to war and they're like, oh Alex, it'll be like Iraq, it'll be okay.
[00:23:33.569 --> 00:23:34.029]  No, it won't.
[00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:38.892]  It'll be totally different if that happens.
[00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:41.373]  And hasn't Putin been proven right?
[00:23:43.374 --> 00:23:46.896]  Remember Putin last week, the day after
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:53.281]  This report came out that the Pentagon was preparing first strike nuclear attacks.
[00:23:59.503 --> 00:24:02.964]  Putin came out and said this could be the end of the world.
[00:24:03.004 --> 00:24:03.944]  Here's some of those articles.
[00:24:04.605 --> 00:24:04.845]  U.S.
[00:24:04.865 --> 00:24:09.806]  says it won't roll out first nuclear strike because allies wouldn't trust it otherwise.
[00:24:11.207 --> 00:24:16.108]  Putin warns of nuclear global catastrophe once treaties expire.
[00:24:18.507 --> 00:24:19.327]  I thought it was the day after.
[00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:32.515]  It was the day the Pentagon put this out and then removed it a few days later and reclassified Joint Publication 3-72 Nuclear Operations, 11th of June, 2019.
[00:24:32.855 --> 00:24:37.057]  But it's obviously on the way back machine.
[00:24:38.198 --> 00:24:41.600]  Something put on the Internet is near impossible to take off the Internet.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.622]  And it describes the entire doctrine that Hillary wanted
[00:24:45.663 --> 00:24:52.188]  And the neocons wanted the same people for first strikes on Russia, China, Iran, and others.
[00:24:52.288 --> 00:24:53.269]  Total madness.
[00:24:53.749 --> 00:24:58.573]  Because once you have that doctrine, it allows them to first strike you and not be the villains as well.
[00:24:59.574 --> 00:25:00.515]  It's the end of chivalry.
[00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:02.856]  It's the end of common sense.
[00:25:03.097 --> 00:25:03.657]  It's insanity.
[00:25:03.677 --> 00:25:10.642]  You know, the sad part about the London Guardian being a well-respected publication of the past is when they publish outright lies against me.
[00:25:11.838 --> 00:25:14.599]  They lose credibility when they publish outright lies about Trump.
[00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:21.460]  But this article from The Guardian is very, very accurate.
[00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.361]  Nuclear weapons experts alarmed by new Pentagon warfighting doctrine.
[00:25:27.781 --> 00:25:36.003]  And then it goes through how it is a first strike situation and how dangerous that is and how insane
[00:25:37.074 --> 00:25:37.854]  All of that ish.
[00:25:37.874 --> 00:25:40.836]  And we'll be watching and waiting for the President.
[00:25:40.876 --> 00:25:44.057]  They say a press conference anytime now or in the next hour.
[00:25:44.097 --> 00:25:44.938]  They're not being clear.
[00:25:44.958 --> 00:25:46.458]  They're saying sometime in the next hour.
[00:25:46.838 --> 00:25:48.419]  Very, very soon is what they actually said.
[00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:49.800]  We're guessing the next hour.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:57.363]  The President is preparing to make remarks from the White House on this all-important issue of nuclear war on this planet.
[00:25:58.924 --> 00:26:00.004]  The ships get sunk.
[00:26:00.985 --> 00:26:03.446]  The Iranians months ago said, if you put sanctions on us, we'll do it.
[00:26:03.606 --> 00:26:04.006]  We did it.
[00:26:05.071 --> 00:26:07.773]  I say they could be the guys that did it, you know, if they're prime suspects.
[00:26:07.813 --> 00:26:10.795]  But then evidence comes out on stage from people I respect.
[00:26:11.936 --> 00:26:25.487]  Remember, the neocons, the deep state, the Democrats are doing treasonous shadow diplomacy and policy, violates the Logan Act, so many other things, giving Iran intel, it's treason, on how to deal with Trump.
[00:26:27.128 --> 00:26:30.831]  Will they end the world or have a war, a nuclear war, in the name of
[00:26:31.584 --> 00:26:32.244]  Embarrassing Trump?
[00:26:32.284 --> 00:26:36.166]  Well, the New York Times has a big article out and their CEO's gone public against Trump.
[00:26:36.626 --> 00:26:39.467]  So has the Wall Street Journal saying Trump's bad.
[00:26:40.567 --> 00:26:46.209]  Because Trump dared say it was treason for the New York Times to lie and say that the U.S.
[00:26:46.249 --> 00:26:51.772]  had attacked Russia's power grid when we hadn't.
[00:26:52.492 --> 00:26:53.432]  That's an act of war.
[00:26:53.952 --> 00:26:55.873]  That undermines the United States.
[00:26:55.913 --> 00:26:58.034]  That could trigger a Russian response.
[00:26:58.694 --> 00:26:59.935]  And it wasn't even true.
[00:27:00.295 --> 00:27:00.835]  And if it was,
[00:27:02.489 --> 00:27:06.610]  It would be treasonous to leak that information.
[00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.811]  But now the New York Times is bitching and complaining that Trump's bad.
[00:27:10.151 --> 00:27:11.311]  No, you're bad.
[00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:15.932]  You're the ones that lie so bad now that it makes my head spin.
[00:27:16.212 --> 00:27:21.934]  You're the ones that have said and done things to me personally that are total hoaxes.
[00:27:23.254 --> 00:27:30.476]  AP reports I lost a lawsuit over a Sandy Hook book I'm not even in, that I've never read, and that my name's not on.
[00:27:32.432 --> 00:27:35.517]  They say I sent child porn to the families, did no such thing.
[00:27:36.238 --> 00:27:42.448]  I was sent death threats in email I didn't open that had hidden attachments to what the FBI says is child porn, and I'm a victim!
[00:27:43.751 --> 00:27:46.776]  But that doesn't stop their lawyers going on TV and defaming me.
[00:27:48.686 --> 00:27:54.589]  And saying they're probably going to sue me for sending them child porn so they can run the whole headline again.
[00:27:55.109 --> 00:27:58.731]  When they're the ones that deposed us and asked for those emails.
[00:27:58.751 --> 00:28:01.212]  And the Blaze is like, why Jones give them all the emails?
[00:28:02.073 --> 00:28:05.034]  The judge ordered those emails, 57,000 of them.
[00:28:06.375 --> 00:28:07.456]  Including unopened.
[00:28:08.236 --> 00:28:11.238]  Because they have lawyers on the show that are like, well you never give people unopened emails.
[00:28:11.278 --> 00:28:12.058]  Those don't matter.
[00:28:12.118 --> 00:28:12.738]  You didn't open them.
[00:28:13.199 --> 00:28:13.859]  Exactly.
[00:28:14.219 --> 00:28:17.261]  They asked the judge to order me to open all the attachments.
[00:28:18.171 --> 00:28:19.572]  The judge didn't fall for that one.
[00:28:20.792 --> 00:28:23.694]  You will order the you will open the attachments so we can put you in jail.
[00:28:26.075 --> 00:28:28.016]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:29.597 --> 00:28:30.798]  Unbelievable.
[00:28:30.838 --> 00:28:33.319]  We're going to get to the bottom of what's really going on.
[00:28:33.339 --> 00:28:35.440]  But the point is, it shows the climate we're in.
[00:28:36.141 --> 00:28:37.782]  It shows the insanity we're in.
[00:28:38.342 --> 00:28:45.366]  It shows how they'll do anything, anytime they want.
[00:28:47.375 --> 00:28:51.819]  Shows they'll engage in any lie, no matter how reckless, even causing war with Russia!
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:57.424]  Did the Pentagon, somebody inside, send that drone, that robot, over the line?
[00:28:57.444 --> 00:28:58.585]  To trigger a war?
[00:28:58.605 --> 00:29:00.867]  Or do the Iranians do this precipitously?
[00:29:02.308 --> 00:29:11.236]  If you are tr- Defiance!
[00:29:12.537 --> 00:29:13.278]  Or rebellion!
[00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:21.744]  It is something that has to be looked at as a neutral statement.
[00:29:23.545 --> 00:29:24.546]  Is defiance bad?
[00:29:26.146 --> 00:29:27.027]  Is rebellion bad?
[00:29:28.208 --> 00:29:29.148]  Is resistance bad?
[00:29:29.708 --> 00:29:35.211]  Well, it really is a question of what are you resisting?
[00:29:35.891 --> 00:29:37.072]  What are you rebelling against?
[00:29:39.246 --> 00:29:48.249]  The left pushes this whole narrative about their rebelling against oppression, and their rebelling against people trying to tell them what to do or say, but no one's really telling them what to do or say.
[00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:50.130]  They're in charge.
[00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.610]  They run the big tech.
[00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:52.610]  They run the corporations.
[00:29:52.951 --> 00:29:54.091]  They run the society.
[00:29:54.131 --> 00:30:02.814]  They have their agenda, and they're openly the bullies, trying to dictate to us how to talk, how to dress, who to have sex with, how to live our lives.
[00:30:05.066 --> 00:30:13.030]  They're constantly lecturing us about microaggressions and telling us that we'll be arrested or taken off Facebook if we don't behave ourselves.
[00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:17.673]  These people are a clear and present danger to free societies.
[00:30:19.413 --> 00:30:24.496]  And so that's what I really want to telegraph to folks is, we know the modern threat to humanity.
[00:30:25.196 --> 00:30:26.577]  Every generation has a threat.
[00:30:27.658 --> 00:30:29.999]  Every generation has a big war.
[00:30:31.681 --> 00:30:35.943]  But this is a political and cultural war, an economic war.
[00:30:37.184 --> 00:30:38.424]  It's raging in 2019.
[00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:48.810]  And the establishment is so angry that organizations like InfoWars are still on air.
[00:30:50.896 --> 00:30:59.321]  They need to have victories because despite their trillions of dollars and their corporate dominance, people are rejecting them on a planetary scale.
[00:30:59.621 --> 00:31:01.843]  Globalism is in full retreat.
[00:31:02.603 --> 00:31:04.965]  It's in full collapse.
[00:31:07.406 --> 00:31:13.570]  And so it's rearing its ugly head and hitting us with every nasty trick it had planned for the future.
[00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.271]  For their conquest of humanity.
[00:31:17.292 --> 00:31:18.132]  And it's still failing.
[00:31:19.113 --> 00:31:20.074]  But for those of us
[00:31:21.385 --> 00:31:27.070]  At the front of the lines, or in the capital ships, we're the targets, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:37.178]  And I never thought of InfoWars as a major battleship, or an aircraft carrier, or a destroyer, or a submarine attack group, but the enemy sees it as that because we are.
[00:31:38.499 --> 00:31:45.605]  And it's essential we stay in the fight, and never surrender, and never waver, and never back down, and never give up.
[00:31:47.099 --> 00:32:02.245]  That's why, with all the unprecedented attempts to criminally set us up and put me in prison and shut down this operation that have been all over the national news, we have launched Save Infowars Emergency Special that's only running for one week.
[00:32:02.605 --> 00:32:04.606]  50% off all Infowars life.
[00:32:05.589 --> 00:32:10.854]  Nutraceuticals and supplements, free shipping and double Patriot Points on your next order.
[00:32:11.095 --> 00:32:11.675]  Instead of 5%, 10%.
[00:32:12.035 --> 00:32:14.558]  That's an additional 10% off every dollar.
[00:32:15.459 --> 00:32:18.722]  Get 50% off all InfoWars Live formulas, free shipping, double Patriot Points and more.
[00:32:19.123 --> 00:32:25.169]  This could be your last chance to stock up on top InfoWars Live formulas before they are completely out of stock.
[00:32:26.688 --> 00:32:29.711]  And again, that's the point I've gotten to of having to admit the attack we're under.
[00:32:30.072 --> 00:32:37.739]  The warehouse has confirmed we are already selling out of survivable SHIELD X2, Dayson Iodine, Super Metal Vitality, and DNA Force.
[00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:44.305]  Plus, now is the time to secure your order before they completely sell out and know that you fund us into the future.
[00:32:44.666 --> 00:32:49.470]  Take advantage of this massive special and support the defense of free speech and reality.
[00:32:50.231 --> 00:32:52.372]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:34.602 --> 00:33:37.665]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:33:38.586 --> 00:33:50.736]  to 3 p.m., the most banned, hated, lied-about broadcast in the world is live, in defiance of everything the enemy could throw against us, thanks to you standing firm with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:51.476 --> 00:33:53.258]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.581]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:33:58.342 --> 00:34:01.284]  Well, Roger Stone is a public speaker and has spoken to
[00:34:02.369 --> 00:34:16.733]  I think it's safe to say over a thousand groups over the years and he's been a speaker to the NXIVM group and Keith Raniere who was just found guilty of sex trafficking and enslaving women.
[00:34:17.633 --> 00:34:21.594]  Devil worship came out, trafficking of children, hooked into the Clintons, all of them.
[00:34:22.234 --> 00:34:25.035]  And it's also now come out, we'll go over some of these stories, that in court
[00:34:26.109 --> 00:34:33.857]  In closing arguments at the NXIVM trial, that Roger Stone was a target that they were trying to infiltrate and control.
[00:34:33.897 --> 00:34:41.825]  They would use the women to try to get men that they would call in to be consultants or speakers, and then they would try to plant keyloggers on their computers.
[00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:47.310]  That they were doing this to the Clintons, to the Brothmans, to others, but the Clintons were aware of it and were doing it back.
[00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:50.253]  This to me is just a gateway feeder cult.
[00:34:51.314 --> 00:34:51.434]  Yeah.
[00:35:09.721 --> 00:35:10.241]  Thank you very much.
[00:35:24.011 --> 00:35:26.113]  Obviously, Iran admits to shooting down that drone.
[00:35:26.173 --> 00:35:31.597]  It's disputed whether it was shot down over Iranian airspace or over the Strait of Hormuz in the international waters.
[00:35:31.637 --> 00:35:32.658]  We will be watching that.
[00:35:32.698 --> 00:35:34.659]  The minute he comes out, we will cut to that.
[00:35:34.919 --> 00:35:47.169]  But, Roger, thanks for coming on for the second time, breaking your silence, to give us an inside view from someone who was a victim or an attempted victim of this now convicted cult leader.
[00:35:49.637 --> 00:35:51.079]  Glad to have the opportunity.
[00:35:51.419 --> 00:35:57.306]  We've talked about this before, as Frank Parlato, who is the crusading journalist
[00:35:57.912 --> 00:36:10.855]  Who really hammered the cult, NXIVM, and ultimately gave the information to the New York Times that busted this entire thing wide open, has acknowledged, I was actually a key actor in bringing the cult down.
[00:36:11.455 --> 00:36:14.476]  The Daily Beast insists that I was a member of the cult.
[00:36:14.536 --> 00:36:15.616]  That is false.
[00:36:16.216 --> 00:36:19.237]  They contacted me about speaking to them in late 2003.
[00:36:19.337 --> 00:36:20.257]  By the end of 2004,
[00:36:23.858 --> 00:36:28.399]  I was deeply uncomfortable, not because I viewed them as sex traffickers.
[00:36:28.459 --> 00:36:31.460]  In all honesty, I saw no evidence of that whatsoever.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:37.141]  What I saw and what they presented themselves as was a self-help course.
[00:36:37.821 --> 00:36:45.563]  They were charging middle-aged housewives a lot of money to take a course to elevate their self-esteem.
[00:36:46.043 --> 00:36:50.024]  What made me uncomfortable, Alex, was that they were bilking
[00:36:50.644 --> 00:37:03.412]  The wealthy parents of a number of their adherents, who I now recognize were under some kind of mind control, to transfer literally millions of dollars from their trust funds.
[00:37:03.832 --> 00:37:12.718]  What I saw Keith Ranieri running was a financial scam, a Ponzi scam, and I ended up, because I asked many questions,
[00:37:13.238 --> 00:37:14.399]  On their enemies list.
[00:37:14.739 --> 00:37:24.187]  We now know, according to the Albany Times Union, they were keeping a file on me, along with a number of other prominent people of both parties.
[00:37:24.828 --> 00:37:28.271]  So I'm glad to have the opportunity to clear the air.
[00:37:29.632 --> 00:37:32.274]  Many of the news reports say that
[00:37:32.873 --> 00:37:39.875]  Keith Raniere referred to himself and his followers referred to him as the smartest man in the world.
[00:37:40.015 --> 00:37:41.116]  Actually, that's untrue.
[00:37:41.716 --> 00:37:43.037]  I hung that title on him.
[00:37:43.797 --> 00:37:47.278]  I actually was so unimpressed the one time I met him.
[00:37:47.838 --> 00:37:48.899]  I'd forgotten meeting him.
[00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:50.119]  I met him one time
[00:37:50.726 --> 00:38:01.010]  Over a year's period in which I was in contact with these people, I had been contacted by Nancy Salzman, who was one of the key witnesses against him, of course, in this trial.
[00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.331]  So I'm glad to have this opportunity to clear the air.
[00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:08.413]  Well, Roger, I'm glad you can come on and talk about it, because this is a window into Hollywood.
[00:38:08.473 --> 00:38:13.935]  There's a lot of similar cults to this, and they're always run by very unremarkable-type individuals.
[00:38:14.455 --> 00:38:15.796]  And it just shows how dangerous it is.
[00:38:15.836 --> 00:38:24.743]  As you reported, major New York papers, and it came out in the court hearing, are reporting that they were trying to recruit you as a speaker to try to compromise you with some of these women.
[00:38:24.763 --> 00:38:29.027]  But over dinner, I know a few years ago when this first broke, you were like, well, number one, I'm married.
[00:38:29.067 --> 00:38:30.408]  Number two, they're not very attractive.
[00:38:30.908 --> 00:38:43.700]  They look like they were all starving to death, and we now know that was part of the cult, was keeping them on very low calories, branding them, torturing them, and then using the women, like basically he was their pimp, to go out and set people up.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:50.226]  So, leftist women rejecting normal husbands, normal life, seem to love though being abused.
[00:38:50.246 --> 00:38:50.787]  It's very sick.
[00:38:51.834 --> 00:39:09.726]  You know, during the time that I was in touch with them, I came to know Catherine Oxenberg, the actress, a great woman, a woman who has suffered incredibly because the cult essentially mind controlled her daughter, India, and took her away from her family, took her away from her mother.
[00:39:10.146 --> 00:39:13.208]  She's written a terrific book about this awful experience.
[00:39:14.229 --> 00:39:17.371]  And we concluded between us, Catherine and I, and later,
[00:39:17.991 --> 00:39:22.994]  Uh, with others who had brushed up against the cult, that we were dealing with evil.
[00:39:23.574 --> 00:39:25.795]  Again, I never saw any attractive women.
[00:39:25.815 --> 00:39:28.097]  In fact, I never saw any young women.
[00:39:28.357 --> 00:39:39.603]  Uh, at the time that I had my brief interface with them, all I saw, again, was a financial scheme, uh, and, uh, I never saw the branding or the cult.
[00:39:39.723 --> 00:39:43.665]  I think that that stuff became more apparent much, much later.
[00:39:44.423 --> 00:39:48.946]  They had no understanding of how our American democracy works.
[00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:52.428]  They didn't understand the three branches of government.
[00:39:52.488 --> 00:39:56.191]  They didn't understand anything about how government works.
[00:39:57.231 --> 00:40:05.517]  They represented to me that some of their intellectual property and some of their self-help training manuals had been stolen.
[00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:08.418]  And I kept telling them, well, then you need to hire a lawyer.
[00:40:08.619 --> 00:40:09.719]  You don't need a lobbyist.
[00:40:09.759 --> 00:40:12.261]  You need an attorney, a good attorney.
[00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:29.417]  A number of attorneys that did work for them have been unfairly smeared, as I have, who reproach this as a legal... Roger, we know how these cults operate, but like you said, they're so stupid in ways, but not in others.
[00:40:29.457 --> 00:40:36.079]  And what it is, is they really go out and look for weak-minded people, because they're weak-minded themselves, and then they live in these delusional fantasy lands.
[00:40:36.439 --> 00:40:38.000]  So I liken the NXIVM cult
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:49.568]  To Hillary and to Obama and these other globalists because they put out their Homeland Show against me and statements and documents show they really believe I'm the Homeland character.
[00:40:50.189 --> 00:40:51.790]  They really believe Hillary was going to win.
[00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.771]  Hillary attacked me yesterday.
[00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:54.672]  I'm sure you've seen that.
[00:40:55.993 --> 00:40:57.254]  No connection to reality.
[00:40:58.701 --> 00:40:59.962]  And they just don't understand.
[00:41:00.002 --> 00:41:02.685]  It just seems like they are a cult themselves.
[00:41:02.725 --> 00:41:12.674]  So, of course, Hillary and Chuckie Schumer and others were, quote, allies of the cult and interfacing with it, just like they were doing with Jeffrey Epstein, just like they were interfacing with any other cult they could.
[00:41:13.014 --> 00:41:19.580]  Why do you think the Clintons, particularly, and the Democrats are always buzzing around like flies around honey cults?
[00:41:20.871 --> 00:41:26.984]  It's very interesting because there were some very clear ties between NXIVM and the Clinton gang in New York.
[00:41:27.805 --> 00:41:31.413]  They were financial supporters of Hillary Clinton, both in her Senate race.
[00:41:32.192 --> 00:41:38.156]  And in her presidential campaigns, I find that extraordinarily curious.
[00:41:38.597 --> 00:41:43.760]  You know, Alex, you and I are in the same club because Hillary attacked me in a tweet only days ago.
[00:41:44.601 --> 00:41:50.805]  Of course, I'm still facing a seven-count criminal indictment by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.
[00:41:51.185 --> 00:41:53.066]  As you know, I have pled not guilty.
[00:41:53.447 --> 00:41:55.648]  I intend to take that trial in November.
[00:41:56.028 --> 00:41:59.831]  Folks who want to help me, by the way, can go to stonedefensefund.com.
[00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:02.852]  I intend to fight to clear my name.
[00:42:03.273 --> 00:42:07.655]  In the meantime, Hillary Clinton piles on me same way they pile on you.
[00:42:07.735 --> 00:42:17.500]  And Alex, I've got to say, this most recent smear against you in which people sent you encrypted kiddie porn that you couldn't open and didn't open
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.681]  Well, we've got the big news.
[00:42:35.695 --> 00:42:37.497]  War with Iran basically has already begun.
[00:42:38.077 --> 00:42:42.440]  Sunken tankers, drones shot down, Trump says they'll pay.
[00:42:42.481 --> 00:42:45.463]  I want to get your view on Donald Trump and what you think he's going to do.
[00:42:45.583 --> 00:43:00.295]  I know you've played a lot of poker with Mr. Bolton and you guys have been longtime friends, but I've talked to our other longtime friends who are advising the president and they say Bolton is a sinister psychotic and is advising Trump to perhaps even use nuclear weapons.
[00:43:00.775 --> 00:43:01.696]  I said that days ago.
[00:43:02.296 --> 00:43:02.897]  The globalist.
[00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:16.453]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:43:17.393 --> 00:43:31.162]  What do you do to a 100% American company standing up for unborn, standing up for babies being killed after they're born, standing up against sexualization of children and pedophile drag queen story time for kids?
[00:43:31.523 --> 00:43:32.163]  What do you do?
[00:43:32.963 --> 00:43:38.047]  Well, we just saw in thousands of publications, we just saw how they strike back on it.
[00:43:38.732 --> 00:43:41.253]  Well, and it's the same thing they always do with projection.
[00:43:41.573 --> 00:43:47.954]  It really makes you wonder about them projecting child porn and pedophilic activity onto you, which you're totally innocent of.
[00:43:48.034 --> 00:43:50.495]  It's totally proven in the documents, in the stories.
[00:43:50.715 --> 00:43:51.995]  They just run with a fake headline.
[00:43:52.375 --> 00:43:54.575]  But remember what happened in the 2016 election?
[00:43:55.156 --> 00:43:57.576]  Hillary Clinton colluded with Russia, and then what'd they say?
[00:43:57.876 --> 00:43:58.936]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[00:43:58.956 --> 00:44:06.058]  So it really makes you wonder if they're not doing that same psychology to you right now, who've been talking about the underground pedophile rings for decades.
[00:44:07.162 --> 00:44:10.304]  And again, we get hit with the fake Sandy Hook lawsuit.
[00:44:10.344 --> 00:44:10.965]  Stuff we didn't do.
[00:44:11.005 --> 00:44:12.006]  They're using the poor families.
[00:44:12.386 --> 00:44:14.527]  And they want all our emails.
[00:44:14.547 --> 00:44:15.608]  9.6 million that said Sandy Hook.
[00:44:16.068 --> 00:44:18.070]  We go, hey, how about just ones with Sandy Hook in them?
[00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:19.631]  And a bunch of other search terms.
[00:44:19.651 --> 00:44:20.732]  All the families, all the names.
[00:44:20.752 --> 00:44:22.013]  We don't even talk about them.
[00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:22.893]  They search it all.
[00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.154]  They go, we want your metadata.
[00:44:24.174 --> 00:44:24.815]  We're like, what's that?
[00:44:24.875 --> 00:44:25.835]  All the weird code.
[00:44:26.596 --> 00:44:31.279]  So they find hidden links in there and go report to the FBI.
[00:44:31.379 --> 00:44:32.580]  I got pissed about that.
[00:44:33.621 --> 00:44:34.642]  And so what's their response?
[00:44:35.848 --> 00:44:38.251]  Alex Jones sent Sandy Hook family's child porn.
[00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:39.692]  No, I didn't send them.
[00:44:39.772 --> 00:44:43.977]  People threatening us for covering Sandy Hook said we're going to get you because you cover Sandy Hook.
[00:44:44.317 --> 00:44:46.740]  Sent us links that we didn't open.
[00:44:47.721 --> 00:44:50.844]  That's like if somebody comes and puts child porn in your mailbox.
[00:44:51.205 --> 00:44:51.985]  It's not your fault.
[00:44:53.191 --> 00:45:00.835]  This is crazy, but they think just that term, they think you're so dumb that they're just gonna say the word, the term child porn.
[00:45:00.855 --> 00:45:02.295]  Oh my God, I'm gonna run away from you!
[00:45:02.575 --> 00:45:03.476]  Folks, nobody's buying it.
[00:45:03.496 --> 00:45:05.777]  We're seeing our support surge, but that's good.
[00:45:06.988 --> 00:45:09.371]  Because we gotta fight these people on every front, that's why.
[00:45:09.411 --> 00:45:16.179]  When you get a t-shirt, when you get a book, when you get a film, when you get great supplements, you are literally funding the second American Revolution against evil.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.023]  It's never been clearer, the fight between good and evil, and everybody, I think, is getting it.
[00:45:20.384 --> 00:45:23.407]  Well, and I just want the audience to understand how dire it is.
[00:45:23.427 --> 00:45:26.051]  I mean, we were just talking, how many cards did they have left?
[00:45:26.471 --> 00:45:33.354]  To try and play against us before they literally try to put a bullet in your head or just blow this place up with, like, I mean, who knows what these Antifa people around here do.
[00:45:33.394 --> 00:45:34.615]  I hope they wouldn't get that violent.
[00:45:34.675 --> 00:45:39.437]  Or maybe, you know, some spook CIA, FBI wants to come through here and try to mess with us.
[00:45:39.477 --> 00:45:40.778]  I know that you've dealt with that before.
[00:45:40.798 --> 00:45:42.519]  And we're not bitching and complaining.
[00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:43.699]  We want a strong finish.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.421]  I think we're going to continue on, but whatever.
[00:45:46.461 --> 00:45:48.342]  We're going on into the frickin' night.
[00:45:49.042 --> 00:45:50.563]  We're pedal to the metal.
[00:45:50.703 --> 00:45:56.868]  It's that old saying of John Paul Jones, when the ship was sinking, fighting the British, they said, surrender.
[00:45:56.889 --> 00:45:57.929]  And he said, I've only begun to fight.
[00:45:58.350 --> 00:45:59.591]  We don't know how to give up.
[00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:05.776]  And I feel good at a spiritual level, because the fact that the enemy has to play one of their ace of spades.
[00:46:06.636 --> 00:46:09.118]  I agree, kill us, whatever, that's the next one that makes the smartest.
[00:46:09.399 --> 00:46:10.199]  It's not going to work.
[00:46:10.299 --> 00:46:11.580]  They're losing, Owen.
[00:46:11.801 --> 00:46:15.404]  Well, imagine, for me, it's like, as a news reporter, as a show host,
[00:46:16.164 --> 00:46:18.846]  I wanted to play for the best team, and that was InfoWars.
[00:46:18.866 --> 00:46:24.031]  So that's like, let's say a young kid grows up trying to play baseball, and he wants to play for the New York Yankees.
[00:46:24.531 --> 00:46:27.614]  But he finds out, uh-oh, someone's trying to destroy the Yankees.
[00:46:27.694 --> 00:46:31.557]  The Mets are trying to destroy the Yankees, and they're lying about them, and the Yankees are in dire straits.
[00:46:31.938 --> 00:46:33.639]  But that kid just wants to play for the Yankees.
[00:46:33.679 --> 00:46:37.142]  He just got drafted, and he's just saying, fans, please support the Yankees.
[00:46:37.202 --> 00:46:40.765]  Make sure that the Yankees are still here so you can go to the stadium and root for them, and I can play for them.
[00:46:41.146 --> 00:46:42.367]  That's where we're at right now.
[00:46:42.507 --> 00:46:43.888]  I want to play for InfoWars forever.
[00:46:44.068 --> 00:46:44.428]  Exactly.
[00:46:44.468 --> 00:46:46.971]  They're saying we're putting cyanide in the peanuts and hot dogs.
[00:46:48.152 --> 00:46:49.032]  None of it's true, folks.
[00:46:49.093 --> 00:46:50.234]  We're not the pedophiles.
[00:46:50.814 --> 00:46:53.196]  We're the Patriots, and we're winning thanks to your support.
[00:46:53.576 --> 00:46:58.080]  We have Save & For Special, 50% off, double Patriot points, storewide free shipping.
[00:46:58.401 --> 00:47:01.864]  Double down, take action, and show these bastards we're not backing down.
[00:47:01.904 --> 00:47:02.644]  God bless you all.
[00:47:06.948 --> 00:47:09.571]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:14.781 --> 00:47:19.548]  Well, I was just talking to the crew, and they were saying a lot of folks were waking up.
[00:47:31.966 --> 00:47:37.189]  Numbers show that Trump's going to win pretty big 2020, but not if they can launch a new war to embarrass the president.
[00:47:37.949 --> 00:47:39.830]  And this thing could do a lot more than embarrass the president.
[00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:43.772]  There's new nuclear doctrines have been issued about first strikes with nuclear weapons.
[00:47:44.453 --> 00:47:46.174]  I knew that was on the table.
[00:47:46.234 --> 00:47:47.574]  Putin's warning of nuclear war.
[00:47:47.935 --> 00:47:52.197]  John Bolton will get his old friend's take.
[00:47:52.677 --> 00:47:54.698]  Roger Stone on that in a moment.
[00:47:54.718 --> 00:47:57.920]  These guys have drank a lot of scotch, put a lot of poker together.
[00:47:59.147 --> 00:47:59.707]  We're good to go.
[00:48:22.063 --> 00:48:23.344]  Iran made a very big mistake.
[00:48:23.364 --> 00:48:25.626]  We'll get Roger Stone's expert take.
[00:48:25.666 --> 00:48:29.269]  He's the guy that they admit got Trump the build-the-wall idea and so much more.
[00:48:29.609 --> 00:48:32.531]  He's known Trump 40-plus years.
[00:48:32.551 --> 00:48:32.751]  43 years.
[00:48:33.672 --> 00:48:37.735]  What will El Presidente do from his old wingman?
[00:48:37.855 --> 00:48:38.295]  That's right.
[00:48:38.335 --> 00:48:40.537]  That's what Roger Stone really is, is Trump's old wingman.
[00:48:41.438 --> 00:48:42.499]  Nothing to hide there.
[00:48:42.559 --> 00:48:44.320]  In between divorces, they double-date girls.
[00:48:45.441 --> 00:48:46.562]  So we're going to go to Roger in a moment.
[00:48:46.662 --> 00:48:49.384]  Please remember, ladies and gentlemen, you heard Roger talk about
[00:48:50.342 --> 00:48:57.705]  How I was sent encrypted, hidden child porn in death threats about Sandy Hook that I never opened.
[00:48:58.445 --> 00:49:03.047]  Then they subpoenaed dozens of search terms of everybody involved with Sandy Hook.
[00:49:03.871 --> 00:49:07.272]  We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars going through 9.6 million emails.
[00:49:07.833 --> 00:49:08.713]  That's how much it costs.
[00:49:09.053 --> 00:49:12.194]  And notice these law firms are still saying, we may sue Jones or whatever.
[00:49:12.594 --> 00:49:13.895]  He sent us child porn.
[00:49:14.395 --> 00:49:19.977]  So we spent hundreds of thousands of dollars with two law firms and teams of people to go through 9.6 million emails.
[00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:24.099]  And they go to the judge and they say, we want him to open every attachment.
[00:49:25.037 --> 00:49:26.578]  Of 9.6 million emails.
[00:49:27.258 --> 00:49:28.139]  Well, that's illegal.
[00:49:28.179 --> 00:49:29.100]  The judge even got that.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:30.961]  Because what if there is child porn?
[00:49:30.981 --> 00:49:31.481]  That's a crime.
[00:49:32.001 --> 00:49:34.203]  And big media organizations are sent this stuff.
[00:49:35.403 --> 00:49:37.585]  And so we didn't do that.
[00:49:38.365 --> 00:49:41.727]  Now they sent it to a California firm that scanned it and found the hidden links.
[00:49:42.128 --> 00:49:45.590]  And they run the headlines everywhere that I sent them child porn.
[00:49:46.806 --> 00:49:52.492]  And then they say I'm defaming them when I got pissed off and said I'm gonna find out who's trying to set me up and I want to see him go to prison.
[00:49:52.512 --> 00:49:55.095]  And then they said, oh, you're blaming the lawyers for it.
[00:49:55.535 --> 00:49:56.316]  No, I didn't do that.
[00:49:57.637 --> 00:49:58.938]  But what's the old Shakespeare saying?
[00:49:58.958 --> 00:50:01.621]  I does think you protest too much?
[00:50:02.602 --> 00:50:04.024]  No, I don't think they're dumb enough to do that.
[00:50:04.284 --> 00:50:06.827]  You think I'm dumb enough to send you child porn, you maniacs?
[00:50:07.527 --> 00:50:08.208]  What the hell?
[00:50:08.328 --> 00:50:09.429]  Excuse me, I'm starting to get mad.
[00:50:09.469 --> 00:50:09.970]  Excuse me, Lord.
[00:50:11.409 --> 00:50:14.991]  The fact that they will, we're going to go to Roger here in a moment, the fact that they will go this far is insane.
[00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:18.154]  So we'll finish up with that and get into the war situation and more with Roger.
[00:50:18.954 --> 00:50:19.875]  Please support us.
[00:50:19.895 --> 00:50:21.276]  I want to thank Lister's for your support.

[00:50:29.161 --> 00:50:29.861]  That's everything.

[00:50:53.982 --> 00:50:54.702]  Methicobalamin.
[00:50:54.742 --> 00:50:55.503]  Highest quality.
[00:50:56.243 --> 00:50:58.805]  No one can get one at that price.
[00:50:58.866 --> 00:50:59.506]  It's amazing.

[00:51:23.886 --> 00:51:26.668]  And please support local AM and FM and TV stations.
[00:51:26.748 --> 00:51:27.169]  Thank them.
[00:51:27.729 --> 00:51:31.092]  Send them a monthly tithe, a donation towards free speech.
[00:51:31.572 --> 00:51:32.733]  We stand up for the unborn.
[00:51:33.173 --> 00:51:35.735]  We stand up against the gay pride parade sexualizing children.
[00:51:36.056 --> 00:51:37.477]  We stand up against the devil whispers.
[00:51:37.717 --> 00:51:40.260]  Your average church is just a feel-good institution that doesn't do that.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:41.842]  Don't send them your money.
[00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:44.985]  Send it to the local radio station that puts on the truth.
[00:51:45.986 --> 00:51:47.368]  Ask God to tell you what to do.
[00:51:47.408 --> 00:51:48.049]  It's important.
[00:51:49.731 --> 00:51:50.511]  Ask your conscience.
[00:51:51.633 --> 00:51:52.513]  Going back to Roger Stone.
[00:51:52.533 --> 00:51:58.877]  Roger, finishing up with the incredible hoax that I wrote a book about Sandy Hook that I lost a lawsuit last week.
[00:51:59.057 --> 00:51:59.717]  Totally fake.
[00:51:59.957 --> 00:52:00.718]  I'm not even in the book.
[00:52:00.758 --> 00:52:01.438]  Never read the book.
[00:52:01.879 --> 00:52:02.799]  Not on the name of the book.
[00:52:03.479 --> 00:52:04.800]  Jim Fetzer is a professor.
[00:52:05.881 --> 00:52:06.881]  Just the lies.
[00:52:07.041 --> 00:52:08.182]  That's in AP, by the way.
[00:52:08.362 --> 00:52:09.363]  They refused to retract.
[00:52:10.163 --> 00:52:11.364]  What do you think is really going on here?
[00:52:11.444 --> 00:52:13.745]  And let's talk about Bolton and the whole situation.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:20.485]  Well, we're now in this realm where facts and truth and evidence really don't matter.
[00:52:20.905 --> 00:52:33.076]  In so many media outlets, so many supposed news organizations, falsehoods are not only reported, but then they're recycled again and again and again.
[00:52:33.176 --> 00:52:39.882]  And you can provide them with ironclad documentation that what they're reporting is false,
[00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:43.265]  And they simply refuse to correct or retract.
[00:52:43.345 --> 00:52:45.667]  Politico, among the worst.
[00:52:46.307 --> 00:52:47.968]  The New York Times, pathetic.
[00:52:48.328 --> 00:52:50.889]  The Washington Post, the absolute worst.
[00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:56.972]  So I've experienced exactly what you're going through here, and it's very, very frustrating.
[00:52:57.032 --> 00:53:08.617]  But we're in this realm in which the fake news media, led by CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, and others, no longer have any journalistic ethics or rules.
[00:53:08.978 --> 00:53:09.638]  They will write
[00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:22.123]  And by the way, it's critical you just said that.
[00:53:22.503 --> 00:53:29.666]  Because the Young Turks retracted, Shapiro retracted, hundreds of others retracted when our lawyers contacted them, Bob and others.
[00:53:30.547 --> 00:53:36.489]  But it was the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the AP that led with the fraud to teach others to engage in fraud.
[00:53:36.509 --> 00:53:38.170]  They're doing this consciously, Roger.
[00:53:38.976 --> 00:53:39.837]  No, there's no question.
[00:53:40.177 --> 00:53:41.538]  I should mention the Wall Street Journal.
[00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:42.920]  Particularly the worst.
[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.262]  A reporter there, Shelby Holliday.
[00:53:45.382 --> 00:53:52.668]  Literally, the single most duplicitous, dishonest, crooked, fixed reporter probably working in media today.
[00:53:52.748 --> 00:53:54.470]  Although, it'd be a contest.
[00:53:54.570 --> 00:53:55.431]  I could name others.
[00:53:56.832 --> 00:54:01.555]  Let's talk very quickly about the countries moving towards the brink of war.
[00:54:01.975 --> 00:54:03.216]  Alex, I want to be very clear.
[00:54:03.336 --> 00:54:05.317]  I'm opposed to war with Iran.
[00:54:05.337 --> 00:54:07.719]  I think it would be an enormous mistake.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:19.587]  I don't have the benefit of the intelligence that the president does have, but I fear that Bolton and Pompeo are trying to walk him towards yet another foreign war.
[00:54:20.067 --> 00:54:22.048]  And this gives me grave pause.
[00:54:22.488 --> 00:54:24.049]  I really, I trust the President.
[00:54:24.469 --> 00:54:29.651]  I hope that he will view all of the intelligence with a skeptical eye.
[00:54:30.011 --> 00:54:40.895]  We've seen the deep state create false flag operations in the past to try to inch us towards war or in many cases to keep our troops in Syria.
[00:54:40.955 --> 00:54:46.338]  The fake gas attacks that they now even admit were faked being a perfect example.
[00:54:46.518 --> 00:54:47.018]  I pray
[00:54:47.518 --> 00:54:49.800]  We are not headed to a war at Iran.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:50.420]  I really do.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:54.363]  Well, since you just said that, they handed me a piece of paper as you were speaking.
[00:54:54.683 --> 00:54:55.764]  This is really good news.
[00:54:55.804 --> 00:54:57.665]  CBS News reports U.S.
[00:54:57.705 --> 00:54:58.566]  drones shot down.
[00:54:58.646 --> 00:55:02.369]  Trump says he believes strike by Iran was not intentional.
[00:55:03.269 --> 00:55:04.730]  Obviously, Trump wants a peace deal.
[00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.732]  He was getting close to one when the two tankers sank.
[00:55:08.133 --> 00:55:10.454]  That's still questionable, but why would Iran do that?
[00:55:10.474 --> 00:55:11.055]  It's insane.
[00:55:11.515 --> 00:55:13.576]  And now he's saying he doesn't think it was intentional.
[00:55:14.357 --> 00:55:16.679]  Well, the Iranians said
[00:55:17.847 --> 00:55:24.710]  Well, you know, it's difficult to sort out at this point, Alex, but I do want to point out that Donald Trump was elected as a non-interventionist.
[00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:27.471]  And you can see that some around him
[00:55:48.191 --> 00:55:55.997]  Including Bolton, who I think is a very smart guy and who I would like to give the benefit of the doubt that he would reflect the views of his boss.
[00:55:56.137 --> 00:56:08.607]  But he has seemed to me to be increasingly bellicose, exceedingly aggressive in terms of walking the nation towards yet another foreign war.
[00:56:08.988 --> 00:56:10.829]  I pray the president doesn't go there.
[00:56:11.009 --> 00:56:13.111]  On the other hand, I trust his judgment.
[00:56:13.795 --> 00:56:18.702]  He has available to him intelligence that we do not have.
[00:56:19.183 --> 00:56:29.618]  I hope he will look at it with some degree of skepticism, because we do know that the Deep State will pass on to the Chief Executive things that aren't true or that are colored.
[00:56:30.283 --> 00:56:32.905]  We do not need yet another foreign war.
[00:56:33.325 --> 00:56:37.607]  What we need is peace, but peace through strength.
[00:56:37.787 --> 00:56:47.433]  And you've got a leader now who understands leveraging America's strength to get peace as opposed to launching endless foreign war.
[00:56:47.873 --> 00:56:51.495]  It costs us billions in American blood without real reason.
[00:56:51.835 --> 00:56:52.796]  I totally agree, Roger.
[00:56:52.816 --> 00:56:57.962]  I'm going to do five more minutes and you've got to go catch an airplane on what else you think they might throw at Trump.
[00:56:58.143 --> 00:57:03.409]  But it's really starting to become clear that the tankers probably were a false flag, even though Iran threatened to do it.
[00:57:03.869 --> 00:57:11.718]  It's becoming increasingly clear that there's some hanky-panky going on here by how the president's responding, not letting it suck him into war.
[00:57:12.459 --> 00:57:15.980]  But he also did threaten Iran and said, you made a big mistake.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:19.801]  But now he's reversing that, I guess, as he's learning more.
[00:57:19.841 --> 00:57:23.282]  He supposedly was going to give a press conference sometime in the next hour.
[00:57:23.442 --> 00:57:24.422]  That was 30 minutes ago.
[00:57:25.002 --> 00:57:27.103]  We have Joel Skousen joining us, World Affairs Brief.
[00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:28.143]  Very smart cookie.
[00:57:28.663 --> 00:57:34.125]  At the bottom of the next hour, as soon as Trump gives a press conference, you better believe on this radio slash TV transmission, we will cut away.
[00:57:34.665 --> 00:57:36.145]  Roger, you've got several websites.
[00:57:36.465 --> 00:57:38.546]  Where's the best place for people to find the work you're doing?
[00:57:39.597 --> 00:57:45.143]  Well, I can always appreciate people going to StoneDefenseFund.com to help me for my upcoming trial.
[00:57:45.163 --> 00:57:49.508]  And if you want to read my political writings, go to StoneColdTruth.com.
[00:57:49.728 --> 00:57:50.489]  All right, we'll be back.
[00:57:50.509 --> 00:57:50.869]  Stay there.
[00:57:50.889 --> 00:57:55.534]  InfoWars.
[00:57:55.554 --> 00:58:00.179]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:58:00.646 --> 00:58:05.627]  InfoWars settles Pepe the Frog lawsuit, pays tiny settlement to creator Matt Fury.
[00:58:05.707 --> 00:58:07.348]  Mark, overall, what do you think of this decision?
[00:58:07.408 --> 00:58:07.948]  Mark Rendazzo.
[00:58:08.068 --> 00:58:18.091]  I mean, look, when they come at us first saying they want $1.2 million in attorney's fees, and then they wind up begging us for a pittance of a settlement.
[00:58:19.064 --> 00:58:21.025]  I think that's grounds for a victory lap.
[00:58:21.426 --> 00:58:24.708]  I mean, the amount that you wound up paying them for a licensing fee.
[00:58:24.768 --> 00:58:29.611]  I mean, when we were calculating what it would have cost for, you know, your first class flight to L.A.
[00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:33.553]  The kind of hotels that we like to stay in and the kind of meals we like to eat.
[00:58:33.873 --> 00:58:36.655]  I think our bar tab would have been more than that in L.A.
[00:58:36.675 --> 00:58:37.295]  just for the week.
[00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:45.160]  I just, I have a very big feeling of satisfaction when they put as many lawyers on the other side of the table as I have in my entire firm.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:54.065]  And then they squeak out the door with a, you know, essentially it was like you flipped a coin to him and said, here, get out of my way, go buy yourself an ice cream.
[00:58:54.145 --> 00:59:02.489]  The thing you were saying earlier about how your viewers and your listeners helped out in order to help you win this free speech fight, I can't reiterate that enough.
[00:59:02.649 --> 00:59:09.173]  You know, when you have stood up on these cases, you're not standing up just for Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[00:59:09.433 --> 00:59:10.934]  You're standing up for everybody's rights.
[00:59:11.694 --> 00:59:17.718]  And, uh, you know, now that this case is over, you know, you can kind of start reloading the guns, but, uh, there's gonna be more.
[00:59:17.758 --> 00:59:18.338]  You know that.
[00:59:18.498 --> 00:59:18.978]  Well said.
[00:59:26.531 --> 00:59:29.593]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:32.774]  Now, we're bringing you an all-new version to help you reach your energy peak.
[00:59:32.954 --> 00:59:40.278]  Ultra 12 from InfoWars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[00:59:40.458 --> 00:59:46.862]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[00:59:47.002 --> 00:59:50.704]  Take advantage of the superior form of B12 and head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.388]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:27.158 --> 01:00:28.519]  John Bolton's trying to start a war.
[01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.882]  It won't just keep Trump from getting re-elected, in my view.
[01:00:32.923 --> 01:00:34.544]  It could turn into a larger regional war.
[01:00:35.433 --> 01:00:40.016]  Putin says it'll be a catastrophe at the bare minimum and says the world could end.
[01:00:40.556 --> 01:00:45.720]  He said that the same day there's a new nuclear doctrine for United States preemptively nuke nations.
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.661]  We'll be looking at that classified document.
[01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:48.862]  It's classified.
[01:00:49.442 --> 01:00:51.263]  Coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:52.004 --> 01:00:53.965]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow's news today.
[01:00:55.046 --> 01:00:57.867]  Better believe Putin saw it that day and that's why he issued that emergency statement.
[01:01:00.131 --> 01:01:05.316]  But Putin is so deferential to the United States, he didn't even say where he got the information that he had the classified document.
[01:01:06.517 --> 01:01:11.261]  So, Roger, what can we do to keep Trump from not being suckered into this new war?
[01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:29.915]  Well, I think the best thing we can do is do exactly what we have been doing, which is to urge him to proceed with extreme caution and to recognize that some around him are not necessarily committed to his reform agenda, particularly when it comes to the foreign policy realm.
[01:01:30.415 --> 01:01:37.539]  I've always been uncomfortable with the disproportionate number of neocons that he has chosen to surround himself with.
[01:01:37.979 --> 01:01:45.685]  These are people who did not vote for him and do not support his foreign policy's goals, which of course are putting America first.
[01:01:46.105 --> 01:01:49.388]  Best thing we can do right now, Alex, is pray.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:02:04.991]  I want to get back to what we had talked about, because in the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:13.457]  I have been subjected to this myself, but I've never seen anything quite like the situation in which you have recently been smeared.
[01:02:13.957 --> 01:02:24.045]  The false claim that you purposely sent kiddie porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false.
[01:02:24.285 --> 01:02:25.246]  It's a smear.
[01:02:26.207 --> 01:02:28.288]  Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[01:02:28.649 --> 01:02:29.970]  You don't even open it.
[01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:36.533]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of nine million documents, and then it's blamed on you.
[01:02:36.994 --> 01:02:38.494]  This is Kafka-esque.
[01:02:38.594 --> 01:02:39.655]  This is bizarre.
[01:02:40.315 --> 01:02:47.159]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say, Jones sent kiddie porn, is really outrageous.
[01:02:47.679 --> 01:02:53.102]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[01:02:53.482 --> 01:02:54.922]  But I wonder, where are the big boys?
[01:02:55.042 --> 01:02:56.202]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[01:02:56.222 --> 01:02:57.923]  Where's Associated Press?
[01:02:58.243 --> 01:03:04.184]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[01:03:04.424 --> 01:03:05.384]  It's outrageous.
[01:03:05.484 --> 01:03:09.985]  Well, that's what's incredible is they're leading in it, trying to get everybody else to do it.
[01:03:10.425 --> 01:03:14.506]  And like I said, saying I publish books I never published, I lost lawsuits I never lost.
[01:03:14.946 --> 01:03:17.406]  And then we contact them and they just tell our lawyers, fine, sue us.
[01:03:17.886 --> 01:03:19.386]  We're going to go with fake headlines.
[01:03:19.426 --> 01:03:20.467]  This is a new level.
[01:03:20.827 --> 01:03:22.367]  I think it signifies the climate
[01:03:22.987 --> 01:03:27.329]  Instead of dialing their lives back, they're just going to dial their lives up to try to take Trump out.
[01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:41.576]  And it's why I think it continues to be important for people to support InfoWars by either going to the InfoWars.com store or making a contribution at the donate link, just like I urge people to go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:42.857]  Alex, we are both fighting.
[01:03:43.317 --> 01:03:49.900]  For our lives and the same tactics that have been used against me by the mainstream media are now being used against you.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:56.862]  Is it coincidental that both of us played a key role in the nomination and therefore the ultimate election of Donald Trump?
[01:03:57.462 --> 01:03:58.143]  I think not.
[01:03:58.423 --> 01:04:04.265]  So we both need your help and I urge folks to continue to support InfoWars with your dollars.
[01:04:04.645 --> 01:04:05.626]  Roger, God bless you.
[01:04:05.646 --> 01:04:06.527]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:04:06.587 --> 01:04:07.788]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[01:04:07.868 --> 01:04:09.009]  Alex Jones did nothing wrong.
[01:04:09.449 --> 01:04:12.892]  All we did was reignite the brush fires in the minds of men and women.
[01:04:13.252 --> 01:04:19.457]  The American people took action, got Trump elected, and all hell's breaking loose because we're fighting for the heart and soul of our country in the future.
[01:04:19.478 --> 01:04:20.018]  Thank you, Roger.
[01:04:20.759 --> 01:04:21.179]  Thank you.
[01:04:21.199 --> 01:04:24.161]  All right, we're going to go to break, and we're going to come back.
[01:04:24.221 --> 01:04:31.327]  And what I'm going to do is air a special report where Pompeo admits that the CIA lies.
[01:04:32.262 --> 01:04:33.442]  They've been lying about Iran.
[01:04:33.822 --> 01:04:34.903]  I'm not fans of Iran.
[01:04:35.783 --> 01:04:45.986]  But I want to start with this report, and then I'm going to get into the nuclear doctrine that just changed, where the United States has new policy for first strikes.
[01:04:47.306 --> 01:04:49.987]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's all coming up.
[01:04:50.947 --> 01:04:53.868]  Some of the most important information we've ever covered.
[01:04:54.108 --> 01:04:54.888]  Please listen.
[01:04:55.288 --> 01:04:56.629]  Please save the audio and video.
[01:04:56.689 --> 01:04:57.629]  Please share the links.
[01:04:58.169 --> 01:05:01.810]  Because we've got to raise awareness.
[01:05:04.437 --> 01:05:08.960]  I don't know if you were happy that day, but I read on your Facebook page you were getting a vaccination.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:09.661]  You were singing.
[01:05:09.941 --> 01:05:20.809]  A PhD immunologist and vaccine proponent recently admitted during a conference that babies are only given shots up to age one in order to train the parents to get their children into the medical system.
[01:05:20.869 --> 01:05:22.991]  That the vaccines are completely worthless.
[01:05:23.311 --> 01:05:35.323]  The notion that babies are being injected with vaccines in the first year of their life simply in order to brainwash parents into feeding their children into the medical system is an extremely disturbing premise.
[01:05:35.703 --> 01:05:39.286]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[01:05:39.387 --> 01:05:42.730]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official
[01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:46.971]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:06:14.828 --> 01:06:18.869]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:26.352 --> 01:06:34.935]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:36.215 --> 01:06:42.097]  President Trump says Iran made a big mistake by shooting down one of our Predator drones.
[01:06:43.649 --> 01:06:46.269]  Putin warns of a global nuclear catastrophe.
[01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:47.630]  We now know why.
[01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:50.250]  We have a classified U.S.
[01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:55.051]  government document they confirm is real that details the U.S.
[01:06:55.091 --> 01:07:01.472]  preparing for first-strike nuclear war against China, Russia, Iran, and others.
[01:07:02.832 --> 01:07:05.893]  Yes, this is the stuff Armageddon's made of.
[01:07:06.773 --> 01:07:11.094]  First, let's go to this RT report to get the Russian perspective.
[01:07:12.227 --> 01:07:19.736]  Here's the story that all Americans should know about and be questioning, and I mean with a vengeance, okay?
[01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:21.158]  The U.S.
[01:07:21.398 --> 01:07:31.089]  is actively planning to carry out a tactical assault on Iran in response to the tanker attack in the Persian Gulf.
[01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:39.138]  This story, first reported in Israel, comes from multiple sources inside the United Nations.
[01:07:39.739 --> 01:07:47.647]  It describes the military actions being considered as an aerial bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities.
[01:07:48.268 --> 01:07:53.253]  The bombing, according to the sources, will be massive.
[01:07:54.215 --> 01:07:57.196]  But limited to a specific set of targets.
[01:07:58.136 --> 01:08:06.199]  Who is pushing this plan, this attack, this bombing of Iran, even more so than military officials?
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:20.224]  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who we have learned has recently traveled to CENTCOM, Central Command Headquarters, in Tampa, Florida, to meet with U.S.
[01:08:20.344 --> 01:08:22.785]  generals there to map this whole thing out.
[01:08:23.772 --> 01:08:37.820]  The trip squarely puts Pompeo out of his jurisdiction, but he is said to be getting carte blanche from President Trump, despite some pushback from military commanders, interestingly enough.
[01:08:38.999 --> 01:08:46.583]  Also interesting is as far as the US news media are concerned, Pompeo can do no wrong.
[01:08:47.403 --> 01:08:55.106]  He gets cover from them, it seems, simply because, well, because he's not President Trump, who they loathe.
[01:08:56.507 --> 01:09:04.231]  But even a cursory look at Pompeo's record and his past reveals a man who may not be
[01:09:06.069 --> 01:09:11.092]  He may not be a real primetime player when it comes to foreign policy.
[01:09:12.013 --> 01:09:18.617]  He is actually a man who has no problems lying, cheating, and stealing.
[01:09:19.817 --> 01:09:25.181]  You know, in fact, who is accusing Mike Pompeo of lying, cheating, and stealing?
[01:09:25.201 --> 01:09:27.582]  I was the CIA director.
[01:09:27.602 --> 01:09:29.403]  We lied, we cheated, we stole.
[01:09:30.704 --> 01:09:34.487]  We had entire training courses.
[01:09:39.366 --> 01:09:39.906]  Did you hear that?
[01:09:42.007 --> 01:09:48.929]  The CIA is an organization under his command that lies, cheats, and steals.
[01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:51.310]  And it is a joke.
[01:09:52.691 --> 01:09:53.671]  Let me play that for you again.
[01:09:53.691 --> 01:09:56.412]  I was the CIA director.
[01:09:56.432 --> 01:09:57.693]  We lied, we cheated, we stole.
[01:09:57.713 --> 01:09:59.513]  We had entire training courses.
[01:10:06.437 --> 01:10:15.822]  How do we know then that the comments he just made this week about needing to attack Iran because they're attacking tankers is not another lie or cheating or stealing?
[01:10:16.002 --> 01:10:16.503]  How do we know?
[01:10:19.272 --> 01:10:24.875]  Most of you who watch this channel don't need Mike Pompeo to tell you some of these things.
[01:10:24.915 --> 01:10:26.535]  You probably already knew that.
[01:10:27.316 --> 01:10:44.444]  But as we learn that he is drawing up plans, literally drawing up plans to attack Iran, it is my job and yours to be mindful of what may be about to happen, based, if nothing else, on what's happened in the past.
[01:10:45.404 --> 01:10:46.565]  Because as Americans,
[01:10:47.915 --> 01:10:51.744]  It's not your right to know what's going on.
[01:10:53.067 --> 01:10:54.250]  It's your responsibility.
[01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:59.853]  This is the news with Rick Sanchez, where we believe it is time to do news again.
[01:10:59.873 --> 01:11:08.419]  Iranians are saying that this drone violated Iranian airspace early this morning and was then shot down somewhere south of the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:11:08.439 --> 01:11:20.649]  The Iranians also came out just a couple of minutes ago, we just got this, saying that the drone also masqueraded what they call its identification equipment, so they're saying that it essentially shut off whatever transponding equipment was on it.
[01:11:21.189 --> 01:11:21.669]  The U.S.
[01:11:21.689 --> 01:11:23.370]  has a very different take on what happened.
[01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:24.331]  As you mentioned, the U.S.
[01:11:24.691 --> 01:11:29.173]  says that the drone was shot down over international airspace in the Strait of Hormuz.
[01:11:29.533 --> 01:11:30.293]  And the U.S.
[01:11:30.413 --> 01:11:34.195]  just coming out also a couple of minutes ago with a short statement saying that the U.S.
[01:11:34.315 --> 01:11:38.577]  did not fly any aircraft over Iranian airspace on Thursday.
[01:11:38.617 --> 01:11:39.558]  That is, of course, today.
[01:11:39.598 --> 01:11:40.338]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:11:40.578 --> 01:11:43.540]  The Iranians are very angry about this, drawing a red line.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:47.201]  This is what the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps had to say.
[01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:47.722]  Let's listen in.
[01:11:50.836 --> 01:11:54.562]  We have no intention to fight with any countries.
[01:11:55.603 --> 01:11:58.507]  But we are completely ready for war.
[01:11:59.008 --> 01:12:03.375]  What happened today was an obvious sign of this accurate message.
[01:12:07.446 --> 01:12:10.847]  So there you have it, the Iranians saying this was a clear message to the United States.
[01:12:11.047 --> 01:12:15.229]  All of this, of course, coming, guys, as the tensions between Iran and the U.S.
[01:12:15.269 --> 01:12:21.030]  have continued to flare up over the past week since those two tankers were attacked in the Gulf of Oman, the U.S.
[01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:23.731]  blaming the Iranians, the Iranians saying it wasn't them.
[01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:27.933]  And one of the things you guys might recall is that after that incident took place, the U.S.
[01:12:27.973 --> 01:12:32.974]  said that around that time, the Iranians had also tried to fire or did fire at a U.S.
[01:12:33.014 --> 01:12:34.555]  drone that was flying over the area.
[01:12:34.595 --> 01:12:35.275]  They say that time
[01:12:35.495 --> 01:12:36.175]  So here's the reality.
[01:12:36.195 --> 01:12:36.576]  Here's the facts.
[01:12:36.596 --> 01:12:37.796]  Here's the takeaway that you cannot get away from.
[01:12:37.816 --> 01:12:40.037]  The United States is in a war with Iran right now.
[01:13:03.012 --> 01:13:06.774]  There's been a cold war going on with them since 1979 in the Islamic Revolution.
[01:13:09.316 --> 01:13:15.860]  Putin is warning the United States that a strike on Iran, if it goes well, will be a catastrophe.
[01:13:16.941 --> 01:13:18.842]  Oil prices are up over 6% as we speak.
[01:13:20.523 --> 01:13:22.244]  We don't know who sunk the oil tankers.
[01:13:22.624 --> 01:13:24.785]  We don't know who attacked the other 10 oil tankers.
[01:13:24.805 --> 01:13:30.149]  We don't know exactly who's shooting the missiles out of Iranian-controlled territory.
[01:13:31.411 --> 01:13:31.891]  We're good to go.
[01:13:56.243 --> 01:13:57.223]  He's almost always right.
[01:13:57.863 --> 01:14:04.165]  And he's going to give us the inside take on baseball on this when he joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:14:04.365 --> 01:14:05.105]  I'm going to go to break.
[01:14:07.006 --> 01:14:14.528]  And I'm going to come back again into the new nuclear doctrine and why I think this is so serious and what Putin has said and what others have said on the other side, a very important segment.
[01:14:16.248 --> 01:14:23.310]  But people are so used to us attacking Iraq or going into Syria or going into Afghanistan or, you know, some other place like
[01:14:26.069 --> 01:14:27.410]  Panama in the late 80s.
[01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:28.550]  This is not that.
[01:14:28.710 --> 01:14:30.231]  OK, this will be a big war.
[01:14:30.831 --> 01:14:34.813]  They've got proxy troops inside the US and other countries.
[01:14:34.873 --> 01:14:36.754]  It's not going to be pretty if a real war kicks off.
[01:14:37.514 --> 01:14:38.515]  And so get ready for that.
[01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:39.796]  And our borders are collapsing.
[01:14:40.176 --> 01:14:41.516]  Our economy will go sideways.
[01:14:42.457 --> 01:14:43.537]  This will not be popular.
[01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:47.119]  But the neocons, the globalists are clearly trying to orchestrate it into this.
[01:14:47.799 --> 01:14:49.800]  Matt Bracken, I'm sure he's a smart guy with a different view.
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:50.741]  He's hosting 4th Hour.
[01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:53.962]  But I agree with Ron Paul.
[01:14:54.062 --> 01:14:55.243]  I agree with Tucker Carlson.
[01:14:57.082 --> 01:15:02.644]  And I agree with Rand Paul, and I agree with Joel Skousen, and I agree with myself that this is not a good idea.
[01:15:02.724 --> 01:15:06.345]  It smells like a trap, looks like a trap, walks like a trap.
[01:15:07.025 --> 01:15:10.046]  If it does all that, chances are you walk up in the woods, there's a big bear trap.
[01:15:10.927 --> 01:15:13.327]  You only stick your leg in it to find out if it looks like one, you know?
[01:15:13.888 --> 01:15:14.548]  Probably is one.
[01:15:15.808 --> 01:15:18.069]  Like red on yellow kills a fella, come across a coral snake.
[01:15:18.509 --> 01:15:19.329]  Might not want to pick it up.
[01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:20.210]  How about a rattlesnake?
[01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:23.651]  We'll go to break, we'll come back back.
[01:15:25.285 --> 01:15:33.337]  Please remember, without you spreading the word about the show, without you telling friends, family, and neighbors continually, hey, you know Alex Jones is under attack, the show you're not supposed to listen to?
[01:15:33.818 --> 01:15:36.542]  Well, it's at Infowars.com and it's at Newswars.com.
[01:15:37.043 --> 01:15:37.684]  And it's at Summit.
[01:15:39.039 --> 01:15:40.020]  Now he's most proud of?
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:40.480]  For eight years.
[01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:10.562]  There wasn't one single hint of a scandal.
[01:16:11.902 --> 01:16:14.983]  President under pressure from a trifecta of scandals.
[01:16:15.023 --> 01:16:20.764]  President Barack Obama trying to get ahead of just one of the three scandals now consuming the country's attention.
[01:16:20.884 --> 01:16:25.845]  That scandal involving the Secret Service and accusations of drinking and hiring prostitutes in Colombia.
[01:16:25.965 --> 01:16:27.505]  The Obama spying scandal.
[01:16:27.585 --> 01:16:29.526]  The mother of all scandals, Spygate.
[01:16:29.546 --> 01:16:30.546]  This is a big scandal.
[01:16:30.766 --> 01:16:31.186]  Scandal.
[01:16:31.206 --> 01:16:32.167]  It's a huge scandal.
[01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:33.168]  The Gun Walker scandal.
[01:16:33.208 --> 01:16:33.909]  The VA scandal.
[01:16:33.929 --> 01:16:34.669]  The VA scandal.
[01:16:34.709 --> 01:16:39.433]  It's a scandal telling America you can keep your doctor, a callous deception that hurts millions.
[01:16:39.493 --> 01:16:43.916]  Today widespread embarrassment about this scandal has really turned to disgust.
[01:16:44.076 --> 01:16:50.101]  All of this comes as a White House that takes pride in being scandal-free has been hammered by a series of controversies.
[01:16:50.261 --> 01:16:50.742]  The latest?
[01:16:50.982 --> 01:16:58.748]  Revelations the Justice Department obtained two months of telephone records of reporters at the Associated Press as part of a leak investigation.
[01:16:59.108 --> 01:17:11.237]  I believe there's been a pattern by this administration in not taking responsibility for failures, avoiding blame, pointing the fingers in somebody else's direction.
[01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:13.179]  Would you agree with that?
[01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:14.620]  No.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.521]  For eight years.
[01:17:16.241 --> 01:17:20.243]  There wasn't one single hint of a scandal.
[01:17:20.684 --> 01:17:32.970]  The CIA went in to walled off Senate computers in a bona fide investigation that's being done of the detention and interrogation of detainees.
[01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:39.134]  As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:48.538]  CIA Director John Brennan apologized today after an internal investigation determined the agency had spied on staff members of the United States Senate.
[01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:51.239]  Firestorms surrounding the IRS.
[01:17:51.299 --> 01:17:53.780]  Last night, we asked if what they did was fair.
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:57.242]  Tonight, the FBI is asking, was it criminal?
[01:17:57.942 --> 01:18:02.284]  I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this.
[01:18:02.444 --> 01:18:11.169]  In the years before the election, more liberal groups were being approved, while conservative groups with names like Patriot, Constitution, and Tea Party were stymied.
[01:18:11.429 --> 01:18:15.031]  In 2011, not a single Tea Party group was approved.
[01:18:15.231 --> 01:18:24.594]  Operation Fast and Furious, an Obama administration program that let thousands of assault weapons fall into the hands of violent Mexican drug cartels.
[01:18:24.714 --> 01:18:29.395]  Guns found at over 170 crime scenes, including the murder of a U.S.
[01:18:29.475 --> 01:18:30.736]  Border Patrol agent.
[01:18:30.816 --> 01:18:37.718]  The Obama administration denied the program's existence and withheld information to protect political appointees.
[01:18:37.998 --> 01:18:40.338]  The Dallas Morning News calls this a cover-up.
[01:18:40.658 --> 01:18:42.519]  Will anyone be held accountable?
[01:18:43.059 --> 01:18:45.220]  One single hint.
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.900]  My main concern is fixing a problem.
[01:18:48.381 --> 01:18:54.862]  New questions over who is to blame for the deaths of some of America's most elite warriors in a helicopter crash.
[01:18:54.962 --> 01:19:00.624]  Their families suggest that the White House and others are lying about their deaths and what led to them.
[01:19:00.644 --> 01:19:06.705]  All of a sudden there's movies, SEAL Team 6, documentaries, SEAL Team 6, SEAL Team 6, this, this, this.
[01:19:07.366 --> 01:19:08.306]  Where did it all start?
[01:19:09.847 --> 01:19:18.494]  Joe Biden in Delaware in a tuxedo with a half a load on, telling everybody it was the elite Navy SEAL team.
[01:19:18.714 --> 01:19:22.197]  Now to the VA scandal, which is now a criminal investigation.
[01:19:22.237 --> 01:19:29.062]  An extensive new report reveals more than 100,000 veterans waited months to see a doctor or never saw one at all.
[01:19:29.483 --> 01:19:33.026]  And some workers saying they were pressured to falsify records.
[01:19:33.146 --> 01:19:36.949]  Now the VA scandal has officially become a criminal investigation.
[01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:41.054]  I think I'm either low IQ or slow or I don't know what I am, you know?
[01:19:41.434 --> 01:19:42.254]  Slow Joe Biden?
[01:19:42.854 --> 01:19:44.835]  Now, I have to tell you, he's a different guy.
[01:19:45.375 --> 01:19:47.076]  He looks different than he used to.
[01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.337]  He acts different than he used to.
[01:19:50.798 --> 01:19:52.239]  I had two cranial aneurysms.
[01:19:53.379 --> 01:19:55.760]  And they literally had to take the top of my head off.
[01:19:55.820 --> 01:19:57.941]  I mean, they take a saw and they cut your head off.
[01:20:00.642 --> 01:20:01.943]  Flawless victory.
[01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:08.988]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:33.291 --> 01:20:34.532]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:34.632 --> 01:20:35.612]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:20:36.413 --> 01:20:41.635]  This is music that I'm playing to be ominous, on purpose, to get people's attention.
[01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:42.716]  That's air raid sirens.
[01:20:43.456 --> 01:20:56.983]  That's what you'll hear for about 10 minutes when the ICBMs are up in space, about to come in over major cities and have their nose cones pop open on re-entry and deliver their payload of thermonuclear weapons.
[01:21:01.135 --> 01:21:02.976]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that's what we're talking about.
[01:21:03.556 --> 01:21:15.979]  We now know why Vladimir Putin came out last week on the 11th, the day this happened, and issued an emergency warning of nuclear war with the United States and the end of civilization as we know it.
[01:21:16.599 --> 01:21:19.560]  Here's the Infowars.com headline that no one seemed to pay attention to.
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.080]  Even the Russian news barely mentioned it.
[01:21:21.581 --> 01:21:26.122]  Putin warns of nuclear global catastrophe once
[01:21:27.236 --> 01:21:41.101]  Treaties expire in 2021 and says the United States doesn't even talk to Russia anymore about nuclear weapons or policy and that it's unprecedented and that it's very, very dangerous.
[01:21:42.502 --> 01:21:43.702]  Today, Putin said the U.S.
[01:21:43.722 --> 01:21:47.524]  military action against Iran would be catastrophic for the region at a minimum.
[01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:54.907]  He added it could trigger an escalation of hostilities of unpredictable types, like World War III.
[01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.790]  Here's another report.
[01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:58.111]  U.S.
[01:21:58.131 --> 01:22:03.154]  says it won't rule out nuclear first strike because allies wouldn't trust it otherwise.
[01:22:04.254 --> 01:22:06.916]  Very, very provocative.
[01:22:07.516 --> 01:22:18.242]  And now we know, I already knew about this but I wasn't at liberty to talk about it, that Tucker Carlson talks to the president every day and the deep state listens to it with extreme anger.
[01:22:18.262 --> 01:22:20.864]  That's why Tucker's had to leave to an undisclosed location.
[01:22:22.222 --> 01:22:22.862]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:22:23.483 --> 01:22:24.383]  Probably already said too much.
[01:22:24.863 --> 01:22:27.124]  But that's how serious all of this is.
[01:22:27.825 --> 01:22:33.587]  And there's only a few people advising the President that he's being set up by the neocons, but he agrees with Tucker and others.
[01:22:34.288 --> 01:22:37.149]  And I've talked to two people that were very close to these discussions.
[01:22:37.569 --> 01:22:38.190]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:39.410]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:22:40.090 --> 01:22:43.132]  Two people, one of which was involved in the discussions.
[01:22:44.933 --> 01:22:46.033]  This is very serious.
[01:22:46.493 --> 01:22:48.254]  Now, what are we talking about?
[01:22:48.274 --> 01:22:49.395]  You see this doctrine right here?
[01:22:50.609 --> 01:22:51.990]  This is first strike doctrine.
[01:22:52.691 --> 01:22:54.853]  Hillary and Obama admitted this was classified.
[01:22:54.893 --> 01:22:57.515]  They changed this somewhere around six years ago.
[01:22:58.516 --> 01:23:02.239]  To have a first strike on Russia or China or Iran or others.
[01:23:02.879 --> 01:23:04.140]  This was leaked out in the press.
[01:23:04.821 --> 01:23:08.004]  And that the Pentagon was considering using smaller tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:23:10.346 --> 01:23:12.387]  Which I'm not against using if somebody attacks us.
[01:23:12.788 --> 01:23:13.889]  That way you don't go to full-scale war.
[01:23:15.882 --> 01:23:25.068]  But you start putting in intercontinental ballistic missiles, or submarine-launched missiles, where they can't tell if it's a tactical nuke, or a full-powered nuke, or they can't tell if it's just a regular supersonic missile.
[01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:26.209]  That's what Putin said.
[01:23:26.229 --> 01:23:27.930]  They're forced to respond.
[01:23:29.431 --> 01:23:35.175]  You can have a bad actor on a high-tech submarine fire a missile that you believe is a state actor, and it's somebody like Spectre.
[01:23:36.075 --> 01:23:41.139]  Somebody like a leftist arm of the CIA, or Israel, or Saudi Arabia, or somebody else.
[01:23:41.279 --> 01:23:42.600]  All these countries do false flags.
[01:23:43.356 --> 01:23:49.380]  But nuclear operations, joint publication 3-72, was released.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.681]  It's been developed in the last year.
[01:23:50.701 --> 01:23:55.024]  It was really already in place for six years, according to my intel, and leaks.
[01:23:55.664 --> 01:23:57.645]  But now it's official policy.
[01:23:58.726 --> 01:23:59.627]  It was out for one day.
[01:23:59.707 --> 01:24:00.507]  Putin responded.
[01:24:01.568 --> 01:24:02.048]  They pulled it.
[01:24:02.308 --> 01:24:04.570]  We were able to get it from the Google Archive.
[01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:05.611]  It has not been taken down.
[01:24:06.491 --> 01:24:09.833]  And it's all the doctrines we've heard before, from the 1960s, from this man,
[01:24:13.854 --> 01:24:19.826]  Who is the basis of Stanley Kubrick's film, Dr. Strange Love, based on Dr. Khan?
[01:24:21.128 --> 01:24:25.156]  Nuclear weapons experts alarmed by new Pentagon warfighting doctrine, London Guardian.
[01:24:25.879 --> 01:24:28.721]  And again, I don't just read this because I agree with the Guardian on a regular basis.
[01:24:28.761 --> 01:24:29.722]  This is accurate info.
[01:24:30.182 --> 01:24:31.903]  The Guardian can also lie, so be careful.
[01:24:32.344 --> 01:24:39.069]  The Pentagon believes using nuclear weapons could create conditions for decisive results as the restoration of strategic stability.
[01:24:39.649 --> 01:24:42.251]  Oh yes, real stability out of threatening to use weapons first.
[01:24:42.831 --> 01:24:44.893]  According to a new nuclear doctrine adopted by the U.S.
[01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:52.819]  Joint Chiefs of Staff last week, the document entails nuclear operations, which was published on June 11th and was the first such doctrine paper in 14 years.
[01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:59.646]  Arms control experts say it marks a shift in U.S.
[01:24:59.686 --> 01:25:14.053]  military thinking towards the idea of fighting and winning a nuclear war, which is called total mental insanity, which they believe is a highly dangerous mindset, which Joel Skousen has been warning on this show for over 15 years is their plan to set us up.
[01:25:14.293 --> 01:25:15.333]  We'll talk about it next segment.
[01:25:15.993 --> 01:25:23.797]  Using nuclear weapons, this is from the document, could create conditions for decisive results and the restoration of strategic stability.
[01:25:24.497 --> 01:25:25.878]  And also kill a few billion people.
[01:25:26.159 --> 01:25:36.248]  The Joint Chiefs document says specifically the use of nuclear weapons will fundamentally change the scope of battle and create conditions that affect how commanders will prevail in a conflict.
[01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:44.677]  At the start of the chapter on nuclear planning and targeting, the document quotes a Cold War theorist, Herman Kahn, as saying,
[01:25:46.124 --> 01:25:54.529]  My guess is that nuclear weapons will be used sometime in the next hundred years, but that their use is much more likely to be small and limited than widespread and unconstrained.
[01:25:55.469 --> 01:25:57.250]  Kahn was a controversial figure.
[01:25:57.571 --> 01:26:05.795]  He argued that a nuclear war could be winnable and is reported to have provided part of the inspiration for Stanley Kubrick's film Dr. Strangelove.
[01:26:06.216 --> 01:26:10.138]  The nuclear operations document was taken down from the Pentagon online site
[01:26:11.226 --> 01:26:17.193]  Last week, and it's now only available through a restricted access electronic library.
[01:26:17.573 --> 01:26:25.642]  But before it was withdrawn, it was downloaded by Steven Aftergood, who directs the project on government security for the Federation of American Scientists.
[01:26:26.343 --> 01:26:28.645]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:31.629]  They always do this where they put out a document and then remove it.
[01:26:32.942 --> 01:26:37.145]  And it's a tactic so they can kind of deny it later, but have it as a threat.
[01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:39.346]  So we'll get into why has this been issued?
[01:26:39.366 --> 01:26:40.487]  Why are they saying this?
[01:26:41.207 --> 01:26:43.889]  You talk about major escalation.
[01:26:44.410 --> 01:26:46.191]  You talk about baby out with the bathwater.
[01:26:46.671 --> 01:26:51.054]  You talk about giving countries an excuse to build up weapons against us and then use them first.
[01:26:52.602 --> 01:27:04.687]  Would the globalists have all their secret weapons, all their super deep bases, all their underwater facilities, all their international facilities, and this is how they want to win the world war?
[01:27:06.067 --> 01:27:07.688]  The final world government war?
[01:27:07.708 --> 01:27:12.210]  Because I think they're going to take out the Chinese and the Russians at the same time if they try this.
[01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:18.392]  Skousen thinks we might take out the Russians first and then the Chinese next, but again, it'll be the globalists doing it.
[01:27:20.145 --> 01:27:27.991]  There'll be the globalists doing it, and then out of this will be a reorganized America, taking over the remnants of the EU.
[01:27:28.091 --> 01:27:33.795]  I'm not sure, but they've got major geopolitical plans on this, and their world government plan hadn't been going too well.
[01:27:34.656 --> 01:27:35.477]  So it's madness.
[01:27:35.537 --> 01:27:36.197]  It's insanity.
[01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:39.720]  It comes right out of the Chicago Business School, Straussian economics.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:44.383]  It comes right out of the neocons, who are power-mad Trotskyites.
[01:27:44.423 --> 01:27:45.905]  These people are just evil.
[01:27:46.633 --> 01:27:54.979]  This is a satanic delusions of power, and you look at the sunken tankers, and now the drone, and then Trump signaling, oh, you're in a lot of trouble, Iran, earlier.
[01:27:55.419 --> 01:27:56.580]  You'll regret this.
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:59.903]  And now saying, oh, I think it was an accident when Iran says they shot it down.
[01:27:59.943 --> 01:28:05.447]  That shows Trump was starting to be manipulated and, I think, figured out that it was, quote, not intentional.
[01:28:05.467 --> 01:28:06.287]  Well, it was intentional.
[01:28:06.627 --> 01:28:08.028]  He's giving them a way out of this.
[01:28:09.029 --> 01:28:12.171]  The Iranians are talking to deep staters who've got another agenda.
[01:28:12.451 --> 01:28:14.872]  That's all the different angles that we're going to walk through.
[01:28:15.152 --> 01:28:17.933]  This is real thinking man and woman's radio.
[01:28:18.914 --> 01:28:23.736]  Not orange man bad, or orange man good, or Hillary good, Hillary bad.
[01:28:25.558 --> 01:28:26.760]  That's not what we're dealing here with.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:35.672]  We're dealing with the real world and powerful interests that want global domination and that are trying to basically derail the Trump administration with a war.
[01:28:35.692 --> 01:28:38.635]  And I think that's really the main target is nationalists.
[01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.790]  Hi.
[01:29:05.888 --> 01:29:07.549]  Folks, you want people to fight for America.
[01:29:07.889 --> 01:29:09.731]  You want people to stand up and say no to the globalists.
[01:29:09.991 --> 01:29:13.293]  You want people to report on the Clintons and all the pedophile rings that are now in the news.
[01:29:13.733 --> 01:29:17.216]  You want people to, you know, expose globalism or the Islamic invasion.
[01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:19.497]  We're doing it, and we're not backing down.
[01:29:19.637 --> 01:29:22.119]  And we're exposing the Covington hoax first.
[01:29:22.219 --> 01:29:23.020]  We expose it first.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.060]  We're exposing it all.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.521]  We are the tip of the spear.
[01:29:25.581 --> 01:29:26.342]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:29:26.362 --> 01:29:31.906]  And that's why everybody has to remember, we're running a Save Infowars special right now.
[01:29:32.446 --> 01:29:35.208]  To get more capital in because we've not been able to expand.
[01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:36.950]  We've actually been contracting some.
[01:29:37.090 --> 01:29:38.872]  The enemy has been winning with all their attacks.
[01:29:38.912 --> 01:29:47.419]  We're still reaching a lot of people thanks to you, but we need capital to get more reporters in the field to launch a bunch of stuff we've got ready to do that is going to devastate the globalists.
[01:29:47.579 --> 01:29:49.761]  We've proven we don't talk, we deliver.
[01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:50.842]  But I need war bonds.
[01:29:50.922 --> 01:29:51.603]  I need capital.
[01:29:51.763 --> 01:29:52.924]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:29:53.124 --> 01:29:54.625]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:29:55.006 --> 01:29:55.206]  50% off.
[01:29:55.266 --> 01:29:56.347]  Double Patriot points.
[01:29:56.567 --> 01:30:00.511]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to the supplements.
[01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:03.774]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:30:03.814 --> 01:30:10.421]  We've got a bunch of new Made in America shirts with really soft designer fabric and really the highest quality imprints.
[01:30:10.621 --> 01:30:15.066]  The shirts are costing us up to $15 a piece and we're selling them on sale for $19.99.
[01:30:15.606 --> 01:30:22.508]  As I've said the other day, and I said to the people in the press, your case is the template case.
[01:30:35.851 --> 01:30:37.513]  For American freedom moving forward.
[01:30:37.853 --> 01:30:41.696]  And see whether or not they can break the InfoWars base.
[01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:46.740]  Whether or not they can stop the InfoWars audience from supporting the InfoWars network.
[01:30:46.781 --> 01:30:53.466]  Because again, like you said in corporate documents, the model of self-funding, self-sales is the thing that corporations, the globalists fear.
[01:30:53.787 --> 01:30:57.790]  Because crowdsourcing and individuals doing this scares the living daylights out of them.
[01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:58.370]  Absolutely.
[01:30:58.390 --> 01:31:14.475]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:31:14.615 --> 01:31:26.999]  It is an old-school American 1776-style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize
[01:31:27.359 --> 01:31:30.740]  Organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:43.583]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who have been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[01:31:43.683 --> 01:31:45.884]  And the InfoWars audience has broken through that.
[01:31:45.944 --> 01:31:50.865]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age of ultimate American democracy and freedom.
[01:31:50.945 --> 01:31:53.506]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught
[01:31:54.006 --> 01:32:01.692]  They've not shut down our speech!
[01:32:02.892 --> 01:32:10.017]  We're at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:17.303]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:32:17.763 --> 01:32:18.563]  Are you coming back?
[01:32:19.104 --> 01:32:20.245]  We're at Infowars.com.
[01:32:20.845 --> 01:32:22.146]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[01:32:22.206 --> 01:32:24.407]  Paul Watts has launched his own Summit.news.
[01:32:24.427 --> 01:32:26.188]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[01:32:26.408 --> 01:32:30.970]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[01:32:31.210 --> 01:32:33.451]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:32:33.471 --> 01:32:36.473]  InfoWars.com, man!
[01:32:36.713 --> 01:32:37.073]  Woo!
[01:32:39.794 --> 01:32:42.556]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[01:32:42.576 --> 01:32:43.958]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[01:32:44.398 --> 01:32:47.040]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:49.302]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[01:32:49.342 --> 01:32:52.844]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[01:32:52.864 --> 01:32:55.506]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[01:32:55.586 --> 01:32:57.848]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:57.868 --> 01:32:58.649]  That's where they find it.
[01:32:58.929 --> 01:33:00.250]  You know, there's things called websites.
[01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:01.291]  Just go there.
[01:33:06.335 --> 01:33:08.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:25.095]  Big Brother.
[01:33:25.596 --> 01:33:26.837]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:27.377 --> 01:33:28.498]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:29.258 --> 01:33:30.739]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.120]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:32.661 --> 01:33:37.364]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:52.703 --> 01:33:54.944]  Well-fitting music, very dramatic times.
[01:33:55.564 --> 01:34:04.406]  Putin came out last week on the 11th and said that the world is facing thermonuclear catastrophe.
[01:34:05.487 --> 01:34:16.370]  He came back out today and said that any Iran strike, even if it went well, would be a catastrophe and perhaps worse.
[01:34:18.447 --> 01:34:25.639]  And now we know why there's a nuclear operations that was published only for a few days last week on June 11th talking about first strikes.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:32.570]  Joel Skousen's warned about this for a long time and how the globalists are trying to manipulate China and Russia into a first strike.
[01:34:33.609 --> 01:34:46.079]  We're going to be talking about that, but first we're going to go over, he's a former naval aviator from Vietnam era, and of course is an expert on this, and the head editor of worldaffairsbrief.com.
[01:34:46.419 --> 01:34:48.180]  This has pretty much been going the way he predicted it.
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:51.583]  Now most experts agree the attacks on tankers were false flags.
[01:34:51.943 --> 01:34:58.509]  Could have even been people inside the regime working with the neocons and the shadow diplomacy of Kerry.
[01:34:59.029 --> 01:35:01.311]  This is all getting very, very sophisticated with a lot of parts.
[01:35:01.351 --> 01:35:02.191]  Now you have this drone.
[01:35:02.972 --> 01:35:08.014]  Predator drone shot down, and Trump first said, you're in a lot of trouble, you'll regret this.
[01:35:08.034 --> 01:35:12.897]  Now he says, oh, he thinks it was inadvertent, it was an accident, but the Iranians have taken credit.
[01:35:12.937 --> 01:35:15.058]  So Trump definitely doesn't want this to happen.
[01:35:15.518 --> 01:35:20.040]  We know Tucker Carlson and others are the very few that talk to him daily that are advising him not to.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.341]  Tucker Carlson called Bolton sinister.
[01:35:25.774 --> 01:35:28.536]  And I've talked to others that talk to the president that say that he's a madman.
[01:35:29.537 --> 01:35:30.497]  Who does he really work for?
[01:35:30.538 --> 01:35:31.298]  What's really happening?
[01:35:31.558 --> 01:35:38.063]  There's a lot to cover here with the current things that are developing, Joel, obviously, but then the larger picture.
[01:35:38.103 --> 01:35:39.584]  So how do you want to take this?
[01:35:39.784 --> 01:35:40.625]  How do you want to break this down?
[01:35:42.028 --> 01:35:47.309]  Well, first of all, Alex, I want to explain that I think this is exactly what the U.S.
[01:35:47.389 --> 01:35:47.790]  wanted.
[01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:53.911]  You know, they've got satellite imagery constantly over Iran.
[01:35:54.371 --> 01:35:56.412]  They know exactly where the military facilities are.
[01:35:56.452 --> 01:36:04.194]  Now, there are these mobile missiles like the S-200 system or the indigenous form of that that Iran has developed to shot down this Global Hawk.
[01:36:05.365 --> 01:36:12.411]  First of all, I want to make a point is that you cannot tell from radar and from the air the difference between a Reaper drone and a global hawk.
[01:36:13.211 --> 01:36:17.595]  And so Iran doesn't know whether or not these things are armed or whether or not there are surveillance.
[01:36:17.615 --> 01:36:18.015]  The U.S.
[01:36:18.095 --> 01:36:20.577]  is trying to make the case this is an innocent surveillance.
[01:36:20.617 --> 01:36:23.600]  But remember, I think this is an open provocation to Iran.
[01:36:24.289 --> 01:36:28.033]  They know that Iran has a lot of hothead type military people.
[01:36:28.594 --> 01:36:31.497]  That's why Iran keeps trying to say, yeah, bring it on.
[01:36:31.978 --> 01:36:33.119]  We're not going to start this war.
[01:36:33.179 --> 01:36:35.061]  But if you start this war, you're going to regret it.
[01:36:35.081 --> 01:36:36.903]  There's a lot of hotheads in Iran.
[01:36:36.923 --> 01:36:37.784]  And I think the U.S.
[01:36:38.004 --> 01:36:41.468]  is betting on that by throwing up Global Hawks or Reapers.
[01:36:42.989 --> 01:36:46.431]  Near the 12 mile limit and testing that.
[01:36:46.831 --> 01:36:51.653]  Remember that the Global Hawk can see up to a hundred miles on either side.
[01:36:51.713 --> 01:36:54.094]  They don't have to be over a ram in order to photograph it.
[01:36:54.114 --> 01:36:55.754]  So there's no need for them to get that close?
[01:36:56.695 --> 01:36:57.075]  That's right.
[01:36:57.725 --> 01:37:02.609]  But I think that if you saw the digital track of this Global Hawk, they would skirt the border.
[01:37:02.669 --> 01:37:04.570]  They're trying to induce a strike.
[01:37:05.051 --> 01:37:10.715]  They wanted to take this to the president and say, look, they shot down one of our our unarmed drones.
[01:37:10.975 --> 01:37:13.097]  And of course, the president made a big deal about that.
[01:37:13.137 --> 01:37:13.778]  They're unarmed.
[01:37:13.838 --> 01:37:20.343]  And if they were if we did or that unmanned, if they were a man, boy, it would be a different story.
[01:37:21.544 --> 01:37:23.885]  He did throw out that this might have been a mistake.
[01:37:24.026 --> 01:37:25.146]  I don't think it's a mistake.
[01:37:26.756 --> 01:37:30.098]  I think this was a knowing provocation by the U.S.
[01:37:30.138 --> 01:37:32.319]  trying to get close to the border to induce a strike.
[01:37:32.359 --> 01:37:38.722]  They did it with a Reaper drone that was over the damaged tanker that they tried to blame on Iran.
[01:37:39.642 --> 01:37:41.103]  This is exactly what the U.S.
[01:37:41.163 --> 01:37:43.024]  wants, and I think it's going to lead to
[01:37:43.804 --> 01:37:46.007]  A military response.
[01:37:46.447 --> 01:37:48.750]  I think that's what the briefing today at 3 p.m.
[01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:53.876]  Eastern Time is with the bipartisan commission there in the White House in the Situation Room.
[01:37:54.757 --> 01:38:00.223]  The fact that it's in the Situation Room means that they're going to brief them on a military response.
[01:38:01.889 --> 01:38:04.231]  Well, that's exactly what I thought when I saw this this morning.
[01:38:04.391 --> 01:38:05.572]  And I was saying Predator, right?
[01:38:05.612 --> 01:38:09.514]  Global Hawk, even more advanced, is that it can see so far up to 100 miles.
[01:38:09.755 --> 01:38:14.938]  Why was it right up against the line with Iranian territory?
[01:38:14.958 --> 01:38:26.246]  And that's clearly easy for the neocons and others to try to then get a response out of Iran to, again, put pressure on Trump, who's shown that he wants to make a peace deal when Aba went there in other ways.
[01:38:26.286 --> 01:38:29.309]  But it appears that they're going to continue to push until the president
[01:38:30.169 --> 01:38:30.931]  Does do something.
[01:38:31.413 --> 01:38:35.302]  In hindsight, a week later, Joel, do we have any more intel on what really happened with those two tankers?
[01:38:37.156 --> 01:38:38.036]  Well, the U.S.
[01:38:38.557 --> 01:38:53.101]  had a show and tell for media on the courageous tanker and to show them, you know, once again, they don't ask them questions, you know, why put a mine above the waterline if you want to sink a tank?
[01:38:53.181 --> 01:38:56.382]  This is a clear sign of a false flag operation.
[01:38:56.422 --> 01:38:58.863]  You want to damage the tanker, but you don't want to sink it.
[01:38:59.323 --> 01:39:02.364]  And so you put the mine on top of the waterline.
[01:39:02.384 --> 01:39:06.606]  And that's just not how a military operation, if Iran really wanted to sink the tanker,
[01:39:07.273 --> 01:39:10.156]  They would have put it below the waterline, but that's not what happened.
[01:39:10.276 --> 01:39:13.980]  So this really looks more and more like a false flag operation.
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:19.806]  There really isn't anything more to know other than the fact that the Japanese tanker company is demanding the U.S.
[01:39:19.846 --> 01:39:21.568]  provide proof that Iran did this.
[01:39:21.608 --> 01:39:29.677]  They are not on board blaming Iran for this because their crew clearly saw missiles coming above waterline and hitting the tanker.
[01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:32.538]  Joel, let's look at this big picture when we come back.
[01:39:32.578 --> 01:39:36.639]  But the few minutes we have here, I know for a fact that we can get messages to the President.
[01:39:36.679 --> 01:39:37.200]  I'm not bragging.
[01:39:37.220 --> 01:39:39.300]  That's why they want to get us off the air so much, why they hate us.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:41.581]  That's why Tucker Carlson doesn't even live in D.C.
[01:39:41.621 --> 01:39:41.881]  anymore.
[01:39:41.901 --> 01:39:44.882]  I'm not going to get any more details, but he has to protect himself and his family.
[01:39:45.243 --> 01:39:48.764]  They're coming after everybody that has access to the President who can even get him messages.
[01:39:49.084 --> 01:39:51.645]  But I know folks from the White House do listen that are good.
[01:39:52.125 --> 01:39:55.267]  What would you like to advise the president who does listen to our guests?
[01:39:56.008 --> 01:40:02.652]  He likes to take in a lot of ideas about what he should do to contain this and not have deep staters continue to stage these events.
[01:40:04.690 --> 01:40:09.335]  Well, the primary thing is to resist the solutions which they're going to present to the president.
[01:40:09.575 --> 01:40:17.082]  I mean, when the president says they made a big mistake, in other words, I'm going to do something about it, he's laying himself wide open for a military option.
[01:40:17.102 --> 01:40:28.693]  And what that military option is probably going to be is to send a cruise missile into some missile bases, some of their assets that are used to shut down or shoot down aircraft.
[01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:35.755]  What they're really trying to do is get Iran, knowing that it's a hothead regime, get Iran to respond.
[01:40:36.551 --> 01:40:38.612]  And to attack some American asset.
[01:40:38.692 --> 01:40:39.873]  That's what they're trying to do.
[01:40:39.993 --> 01:40:45.036]  So this first stage of military response is going to be something to a small bloody nose.
[01:40:45.076 --> 01:40:47.998]  I don't think it's going to be the attack on the nuclear reactor.
[01:40:48.018 --> 01:40:49.399]  I think they're going to leave that to Israel.
[01:40:49.879 --> 01:40:56.864]  This is going to be attack on a small military mobile missile unit just to show you take one of the missiles and this is what you get.
[01:40:56.984 --> 01:41:00.246]  Several military experts on Fox News said as much today.
[01:41:01.443 --> 01:41:02.624]  And I think that's where they're going to be.
[01:41:02.664 --> 01:41:04.226]  Remember, it's not just tit for tat.
[01:41:04.626 --> 01:41:09.551]  It is to try to get Iran to respond and retaliate against U.S.
[01:41:09.591 --> 01:41:12.173]  that can justify a full-scale war.
[01:41:12.293 --> 01:41:13.114]  That's where we're headed.
[01:41:14.295 --> 01:41:17.078]  Looking at the players, is it the neocons you think driving this?
[01:41:17.638 --> 01:41:22.523]  A, B, how do the back channel carry Democrat Hillary Axis?
[01:41:22.543 --> 01:41:23.904]  What do you think they're telling the mullahs?
[01:41:27.606 --> 01:41:31.808]  I don't know if the Mullahs really trust anybody in the Democrats.
[01:41:33.089 --> 01:41:43.815]  You know, there's one very anti-war Democrat, a lady who's been very, very outspoken about the disaster it would be to attack Iran.
[01:41:44.775 --> 01:41:47.777]  But clearly it's the same globalist neocons
[01:41:48.337 --> 01:41:51.139]  That have been driving all of these various wars in Iraq.
[01:41:51.179 --> 01:41:54.901]  I mean, look at what Vice President Pence said at the Military Academy.
[01:41:55.321 --> 01:42:04.547]  He says, I can absolutely guarantee that you're going to go to war to the graduating class, whether it's in Afghanistan or Iraq or Syria or Lebanon, Russia or China.
[01:42:04.987 --> 01:42:06.048]  I mean, he named them all.
[01:42:06.749 --> 01:42:13.673]  This is very, very disturbing that the Vice President, you know, is not trying to preach a doctrine of peace in the world, but is
[01:42:14.213 --> 01:42:16.154]  Preaching a warmongering doctrine, basically.
[01:42:16.695 --> 01:42:23.760]  Is that being done out of the neocon ethos that they have a right to rule, which they talk about ruling reality, being history's actors?
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:26.041]  Or is it something deeper when we come back?
[01:42:26.441 --> 01:42:31.305]  The real spirit of this thing, because it's one thing to have a secret doctrine for first strike.
[01:42:31.745 --> 01:42:35.147]  It's another thing to put that doctrine out, very provocative.
[01:42:35.207 --> 01:42:39.190]  You have really hammered on this subject.
[01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:43.333]  I wouldn't say harped on it, because you've been very calm and eloquent, but you've really
[01:42:44.694 --> 01:42:50.243]  Noted this, and now it seems that your worldview on the long-term plans of the globalists is coming true.
[01:42:50.263 --> 01:42:56.593]  You've been saying for 15 years you believe by 2025 they want to trick a first strike by Russia and China.
[01:42:56.853 --> 01:42:58.495]  We're only a few years away from that now.
[01:42:58.515 --> 01:42:59.116]  Please stay with us.
[01:43:03.391 --> 01:43:08.653]  If you think gun control or something like that is gonna change a terrorist's point of view, I think you're, like, out of your mind.
[01:43:09.453 --> 01:43:12.254]  You may think you've got me worried about what you're gonna do.
[01:43:12.434 --> 01:43:14.515]  Dude, you're about to find out what I'm gonna do.
[01:43:14.935 --> 01:43:16.816]  And that's gonna worry you a lot more.
[01:43:17.096 --> 01:43:20.237]  Lawdog, you don't step aside, we'll tear you apart.
[01:43:22.318 --> 01:43:23.398]  You die first, get it?
[01:43:24.659 --> 01:43:28.820]  Your friends might get me in a rush, but not before I make your head into a canoe, you understand me?
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:31.081]  He's bluffing, let's rush him.
[01:43:31.181 --> 01:43:31.261]  No!
[01:43:32.868 --> 01:43:35.209]  You're not as stupid as you look, Ike.
[01:43:35.729 --> 01:43:39.611]  Yeah, I don't understand the concepts of conversation of the gun culture.
[01:43:40.072 --> 01:43:44.754]  We've lived with guns since, what, the 7th century or something, I don't know.
[01:43:44.834 --> 01:43:50.577]  We all know that right now, guns is a colon, it's a metaphor that disenfranchised white guys need.
[01:43:50.617 --> 01:43:52.157]  It makes them feel good because they're being proud of it.
[01:43:52.177 --> 01:43:53.718]  You can say what you want, I don't agree with that.
[01:43:53.778 --> 01:43:55.019]  There's a big difference between fantasy land...
[01:43:56.138 --> 01:43:58.119]  In reality, Fantasyland is what we do.
[01:43:58.179 --> 01:44:01.101]  Doing a movie, doing a television show, that's Fantasyland.
[01:44:01.281 --> 01:44:02.662]  And that's where that stuff belongs.
[01:44:02.762 --> 01:44:09.825]  In reality, when we're dealing with things like terrorism and whatnot, we're all going to have different opinions on how to do it, how to deal with it.
[01:44:09.985 --> 01:44:17.870]  Mine happens to be that I think there's a very strong reason Founding Fathers had for the Second Amendment, and that is that no government ever
[01:44:18.610 --> 01:44:20.572]  Hasn't had to, um, fight its own people.
[01:44:20.612 --> 01:44:22.933]  And its own people hasn't had to fight its own government.
[01:44:22.953 --> 01:44:24.134]  So what are you gonna do?
[01:44:24.154 --> 01:44:24.695]  Outlaw everything?
[01:44:25.015 --> 01:44:25.756]  That ain't the answer.
[01:44:25.996 --> 01:44:29.478]  Just put some... Put some controls?
[01:44:29.759 --> 01:44:29.919]  What?
[01:44:30.099 --> 01:44:33.922]  So the people... So the people who want to defend themselves can't?
[01:44:34.282 --> 01:44:34.482]  No!
[01:44:34.582 --> 01:44:35.483]  Not so you can't.
[01:44:35.503 --> 01:44:37.144]  Just so the idiots can't get ahold of us.
[01:44:37.164 --> 01:44:39.226]  Do you really believe they're not going to?
[01:44:39.346 --> 01:44:40.407]  Are you serious about that?
[01:44:41.007 --> 01:44:41.788]  Are you seriously?
[01:44:42.228 --> 01:44:42.388]  What?
[01:44:42.508 --> 01:44:43.289]  Good will that?
[01:44:43.429 --> 01:44:44.830]  Oh my God.
[01:44:45.791 --> 01:44:47.272]  We had our Civil War.
[01:44:47.332 --> 01:44:56.159]  If that Second Amendment hadn't been there, those people would not have had the opportunity to do what they considered was defending their life, their way, their style of living.
[01:44:56.739 --> 01:44:58.601]  So I agree with that.
[01:44:58.681 --> 01:45:00.782]  I think that's an important part of our existence.
[01:45:00.802 --> 01:45:07.207]  It's basically that simple.
[01:45:07.748 --> 01:45:10.510]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:45:12.685 --> 01:45:21.168]  A classic InfoWars fan favorite formula, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a must have for any InfoWarrior serious about their oral health.
[01:45:21.248 --> 01:45:25.449]  Featuring natural oils and ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.

[01:46:04.801 --> 01:46:05.161]  Again.
[01:46:05.541 --> 01:46:05.962]  Pretty cool.
[01:46:06.242 --> 01:46:06.842]  But guess what?
[01:46:07.122 --> 01:46:07.842]  It gets better.

[01:46:16.706 --> 01:46:17.086]  Woo!
[01:46:17.286 --> 01:46:18.306]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:46:18.326 --> 01:46:19.927]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:46:20.307 --> 01:46:22.028]  Support the Infowar.
[01:46:22.568 --> 01:46:27.390]  Order and click on AutoShip at InfowarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:46:55.427 --> 01:46:55.888]  We're good to go.
[01:47:26.829 --> 01:47:32.191]  We've been in so many wars, like Iraq and Afghanistan, that are terrible and kill a lot of people.
[01:47:33.271 --> 01:47:35.372]  But I would call them low intensity compared to this.
[01:47:37.373 --> 01:47:39.313]  Iran could trigger a lot of big things.
[01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:46.436]  And in the next segment, after this one, if Joel has time, I want to get his really expert geopolitical view on the brakes, the way this could go.
[01:47:46.456 --> 01:47:48.637]  If it goes well, it's a catastrophe.
[01:47:48.657 --> 01:47:49.497]  I agree with Putin.
[01:47:50.376 --> 01:47:52.639]  If it goes bad, it could be the end of civilization.
[01:47:52.659 --> 01:47:56.063]  But I wanted to ask Joel Skalzin about this military doctrine.
[01:47:56.203 --> 01:47:57.805]  I started reading about this office from the 60s.
[01:47:57.825 --> 01:48:00.108]  It was never adopted from what I know.
[01:48:00.148 --> 01:48:02.911]  I know you've studied all the PDDs and directives that are public.
[01:48:03.860 --> 01:48:04.080]  I don't
[01:48:28.985 --> 01:48:34.067]  You know, they tend to do this, I guess, to scare adversaries and have plausible deniability later.
[01:48:34.687 --> 01:48:36.068]  How big a deal is this?
[01:48:36.108 --> 01:48:37.248]  And what does this signify?
[01:48:37.288 --> 01:48:45.212]  Because you've been warning that this posture in the future would be the telltale sign to basically induce our enemies to attack us.
[01:48:45.232 --> 01:48:49.654]  You also said a policy of saying we would absorb a strike would induce them.
[01:48:50.034 --> 01:48:55.816]  But this policy also, I think, opens the door for people to strike us, saying, well, you said first strikes are OK.
[01:48:56.136 --> 01:48:57.297]  What is really happening here?
[01:48:58.891 --> 01:49:00.752]  Well, the name of the game is provocation.
[01:49:01.473 --> 01:49:11.860]  The Anglo-American establishment of the globalists, as we call it, very deeply involved in a conspiracy to get the United States into a militarized global government.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:15.843]  To do that, they need a war, a major nuclear war to scare the people.
[01:49:15.883 --> 01:49:26.931]  Otherwise, with the anti-globalist sentiment around the world, with Brexit, I mean, we're talking about almost half of the people really don't want to... They've seen what happened to England and the European Union.
[01:49:26.971 --> 01:49:27.832]  They don't want the same.
[01:49:28.539 --> 01:49:38.028]  But I'll tell you, if you absorb a nuclear first strike and you start a war with Russia and China, it's going to drive everyone into a global, militarized global government in order to protect ourselves.
[01:49:38.068 --> 01:49:39.489]  That's their modus operandi.
[01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:45.474]  But in the interim period, there's a lot of other agendas going on.
[01:49:45.594 --> 01:49:54.182]  One of those agendas is to create chaos in the Middle East, so to create a wave of refugees that will descend upon Europe and destroy Western culture.
[01:49:54.222 --> 01:49:55.283]  And we're seeing that happen.
[01:49:55.876 --> 01:50:15.406]  That's the same play they're making here with the flood of invasion of refugees, not only to change Western culture because the Latino culture isn't that far apart from Western culture being Christian-based and oriented, but it certainly will make a permanent democratic majority where we lose our liberty through raw democracy.
[01:50:15.926 --> 01:50:18.687]  That's their agenda with the invasion of America.
[01:50:19.608 --> 01:50:25.411]  But the big agenda that they need to induce a Russian and Chinese military strike on America
[01:50:26.053 --> 01:50:26.774]  It's not a matter of if.
[01:50:36.112 --> 01:50:40.893]  Trump will continue to be provoked until he authorizes a full-blown war.
[01:50:41.053 --> 01:50:50.276]  Part of that provocation is to get Iran to retaliate in some major way after a preliminary cruise missile strike by United States forces.
[01:50:50.896 --> 01:50:58.639]  But this bully-the-world image is extremely important so that the rest of the world will back Russia and China and say, yes, look at this United States.
[01:50:58.699 --> 01:51:02.840]  Somebody's got to take down this bully to stop it from intervening around the world.
[01:51:03.770 --> 01:51:09.074]  And, you know, Iran is not the biggest terror sponsor in the world.
[01:51:09.174 --> 01:51:09.814]  It's the U.S.
[01:51:09.854 --> 01:51:12.856]  and Saudi Arabia and used to be Turkey.
[01:51:12.976 --> 01:51:15.818]  Israel is involved in the provocation of terror.
[01:51:16.679 --> 01:51:31.188]  And to name Iran for simply fighting against this phony war on terror, protecting and using Hezbollah to fight against this kind of terror in Syria is just a tremendous propaganda stuff.
[01:51:33.633 --> 01:51:36.614]  Ultimately, Alex, I would say... No, Joel, please continue.
[01:51:37.274 --> 01:51:37.434]  Yeah.
[01:51:37.734 --> 01:51:43.876]  Ultimately, I would say the biggest agenda, though, because this conspiracy of globalism is not about money and power.
[01:51:43.916 --> 01:51:48.417]  I mean, people who run the globalist agenda are already the most powerful, wealthy people in the world.
[01:51:48.817 --> 01:51:49.877]  They don't need more money.
[01:51:49.937 --> 01:51:55.279]  They don't need more women, more wine, women's songs, yachts, or cabins in the mountains.
[01:51:55.319 --> 01:51:56.259]  They've got all that.
[01:51:56.779 --> 01:51:58.700]  This is really about corruption.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:51:59.500]  This is about
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:02.162]  We're good to go.
[01:52:18.818 --> 01:52:20.899]  At least at the highest level of the direction.
[01:52:21.079 --> 01:52:26.382]  And ultimately that involves killing a lot of people in the world.
[01:52:26.882 --> 01:52:33.985]  It involves the corruption of morals as we're seeing with the homosexual gay agenda gaining mainstream provocation.
[01:52:34.525 --> 01:52:37.227]  And it involves death and destruction that comes from war.
[01:52:38.187 --> 01:52:44.830]  And all of that will give a bigger control agenda to this globalist power structure.
[01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:46.591]  Now keep in mind that
[01:52:47.358 --> 01:52:57.025]  There are three major predator centers, all controlled, I think, under some type of satanic control, and that is there's the Anglo-American globalist establishment, there's Russia, and there's China.
[01:52:57.746 --> 01:53:04.811]  They're in a temporary alliance now, but don't believe that they aren't eventually going to fight one another, and they are planning on that.
[01:53:04.931 --> 01:53:08.714]  But they want to take down the West first in a preemptive strike.
[01:53:09.856 --> 01:53:10.497]  That the U.S.
[01:53:10.557 --> 01:53:11.499]  is trying to start.
[01:53:11.579 --> 01:53:13.762]  And a lot of people try to say, well, why doesn't the U.S.
[01:53:14.083 --> 01:53:14.944]  get this thing going?
[01:53:14.984 --> 01:53:16.587]  Why don't they directly provoke them?
[01:53:16.647 --> 01:53:19.391]  Because they cannot make it appear as if the U.S.
[01:53:20.132 --> 01:53:21.474]  is responsible for this.
[01:53:21.614 --> 01:53:22.496]  Just like Iran.
[01:53:22.816 --> 01:53:23.918]  They're provoking Iran.
[01:53:24.691 --> 01:53:32.661]  With drones tantalizing, getting close to the airspace every day, hoping that they'll shoot one down to be able to start the war.
[01:53:32.721 --> 01:53:43.335]  They've done these provocations with, you know, putting mines above the water and shooting missiles into them and blaming Iran without any proof whatsoever.
[01:53:43.775 --> 01:53:45.896]  This is a definite provocation.
[01:53:46.196 --> 01:53:52.098]  They're very wary of the Gulf of Tonkin thing, which was an absolute falsehood, starting the Vietnam War.
[01:53:52.618 --> 01:53:57.339]  In this way, they've got to have something more substantive, and that's why they're doing these special operations.
[01:53:57.399 --> 01:53:58.419]  Now, I don't know if the U.S.
[01:53:58.439 --> 01:53:59.640]  Deep State directly did it.
[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:05.662]  Could have been Israel, who's in the area, who did it on behalf of the Deep State, in terms of attacking these tankers.
[01:54:05.762 --> 01:54:06.842]  But the U.S.
[01:54:06.862 --> 01:54:10.283]  has been very, very shallow on evidence about these things.
[01:54:10.882 --> 01:54:13.323]  Well, Joel, pulling back.
[01:54:13.363 --> 01:54:13.583]  Sorry.
[01:54:13.643 --> 01:54:19.186]  Earlier when you were talking, I was pulling up some files and playing a clip here on my iPhone that I was about to ask you about.
[01:54:19.446 --> 01:54:21.327]  And of course, that press conference is coming up the next hour.
[01:54:21.367 --> 01:54:22.347]  We'll be covering that live.
[01:54:22.387 --> 01:54:25.989]  But Joel Skousen is the Editor-in-Chief of World Affairs Brief.
[01:54:26.029 --> 01:54:36.473]  If you just joined us, he's a renowned author, researcher, his whole family are some of the first folks to discover the globalist conspiracy of Cecil Rhodes, the British Empire and the whole globalist program.
[01:54:36.953 --> 01:54:37.954]  It's now out in the program.
[01:54:38.554 --> 01:54:39.715]  It is now out in the open.
[01:54:40.655 --> 01:54:43.976]  But I wanted to just pull back here and just talk about big picture.
[01:54:44.416 --> 01:54:47.157]  What do you expect them to try to do next, obviously?
[01:54:47.518 --> 01:54:48.838]  They want to get a war in there.
[01:54:49.058 --> 01:54:50.199]  Why do they want to get a war?
[01:54:50.639 --> 01:54:52.960]  I think it's meant to derail Trump's popularity.
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.420]  Why do you think they're so desperate?
[01:54:58.922 --> 01:55:07.505]  The war on Iran, as its basic motivation, is to destroy the one Muslim country that's essentially become self-sufficient in weapons production.
[01:55:08.138 --> 01:55:13.765]  Iran is far more powerful than Saudi Arabia with its purchased weapons and dependent on the West.
[01:55:13.785 --> 01:55:22.094]  Iran has everything from submarines to missile defenses to its own aircraft production now and is trying to do more.
[01:55:22.134 --> 01:55:25.739]  That's why the sanctions on Iran is to stop the income flow from oil.
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:31.185]  You know, Saudi Arabia is saying, we don't want war with Iran.
[01:55:31.726 --> 01:55:34.330]  Yeah, they don't want to go to Iran directly.
[01:55:34.370 --> 01:55:37.115]  They know they'd lose, but they want the U.S.
[01:55:37.155 --> 01:55:38.337]  to take care of Iran.
[01:55:38.377 --> 01:55:41.623]  And that's why Iran is, Saudi Arabia is playing this.
[01:55:42.512 --> 01:55:44.293]  But it's a very insidious agenda.
[01:55:44.333 --> 01:55:50.536]  They want to take down this one Muslim nation that is actually getting in the way of the U.S.
[01:55:50.957 --> 01:56:04.864]  phony war on terror, which is provocated by Israel and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Yemen used to be part of the team, but now it rebelled, and that's why Yemen is in its target area.
[01:56:05.164 --> 01:56:09.927]  But ultimately, the larger agenda is to continue to create this swarm of refugees
[01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:20.055]  Well, Joe, sitting back as a father, I know you're a father and a grandfather.
[01:56:20.656 --> 01:56:21.516]  I've got four children.
[01:56:21.616 --> 01:56:33.726]  It's just incredibly irritating to me to know that we're still run by globalists partially, and that they're trying to trick us into offensive wars where we lose all the moral high ground, and they keep getting away with it.
[01:56:33.826 --> 01:56:35.568]  And I believe Trump is a good man overall.
[01:56:35.908 --> 01:56:38.710]  I know they admit that they steal his documents, they steal his papers.
[01:56:39.795 --> 01:56:41.796]  They disregard his orders, they lie to his face.
[01:56:43.157 --> 01:56:56.082]  You've got these different arrogant factions teamed up with the corporate media and big banks trying to block our populist attempt to restore at least power back to our central government and the people partially.
[01:56:56.943 --> 01:57:00.264]  And then you've got all the other nationalist movements against globalism happening around the world.
[01:57:00.564 --> 01:57:03.946]  We're going to break in a moment, but I want to come back if you have time for a few more segments and ask you
[01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:24.968]  What you see right now is the state of the world and the fight against globalism and who the different factions are and how you see that playing out currently versus what some of the factions could do differently to defeat the globalists if we were able to, say, talk to the leader of Brazil or talk to the opposition parties like Le Pen.
[01:57:25.548 --> 01:57:31.474]  Because I am able to talk to, name-dropping, it's just true, Nigel Farage or Le Pen or any of these people.
[01:57:32.114 --> 01:57:35.916]  How could we work together in more of a unified front against the globalists?
[01:57:35.996 --> 01:57:37.176]  Or would that get infiltrated?
[01:57:37.636 --> 01:57:41.418]  Is our strength that we aren't centralized?
[01:57:41.438 --> 01:57:42.458]  But is it also our weakness?
[01:57:42.818 --> 01:57:44.219]  Joel Scowls in a World Affairs Brief.
[01:57:44.479 --> 01:57:46.920]  Hour number three will carry Trump's live press conference.
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:49.001]  Will there be war with Iran?
[01:57:56.324 --> 01:58:00.466]  I've thought for a long time about when does the... I'm sorry.
[01:58:02.987 --> 01:58:14.651]  I've been thinking... Truth is my only weapon.
[01:58:16.192 --> 01:58:28.556]  And I've been thinking for over a year about when is the time to be honest with the... It's just a weird question to ask.
[01:58:28.897 --> 01:58:29.857]  Let me put it this way.
[01:58:31.445 --> 01:58:33.707]  Hell, maybe we should just put it out while I'm sitting here trying to figure this out.
[01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:38.412]  You know, we're winning the info war, but we're losing financially.
[01:58:39.333 --> 01:58:40.535]  And that encourages the enemy.
[01:58:41.736 --> 01:58:45.640]  But if I don't tell folks how serious things are, they won't support us.
[01:58:47.642 --> 01:58:48.483]  Let me say it this way.
[01:58:52.995 --> 01:58:58.882]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[01:58:59.643 --> 01:59:03.688]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[01:59:04.329 --> 01:59:08.073]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[01:59:08.954 --> 01:59:14.256]  To have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[01:59:14.816 --> 01:59:18.837]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real S.O.S.
[01:59:18.917 --> 01:59:24.999]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, InfoWars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[01:59:25.836 --> 01:59:26.677]  And so we've reached that point.
[01:59:27.478 --> 01:59:29.299]  It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever.
[01:59:29.379 --> 01:59:31.121]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[01:59:31.461 --> 01:59:33.543]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[01:59:34.044 --> 01:59:35.065]  You have been there.
[01:59:35.405 --> 01:59:40.149]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault.
[01:59:40.209 --> 01:59:45.814]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:46.355 --> 01:59:47.015]  It's your fight!
[01:59:47.336 --> 01:59:51.660]  Decide whether or not you want InfoWars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[01:59:55.054 --> 01:59:59.137]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.657 --> 02:00:00.998]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:19.490]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:00:19.971 --> 02:00:23.873]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.062]  All right, Joel Skousen of World Affairs Briefs our guest.
[02:00:38.662 --> 02:00:40.623]  He's one of the smartest people we could have on.
[02:00:40.643 --> 02:00:44.945]  I tell you though, Joel, it's really scary to know that Tucker Carlson
[02:00:46.281 --> 02:00:49.823]  Is the main guy talking to the president every day saying, don't listen to Bolton.
[02:00:50.063 --> 02:00:50.863]  They're setting you up.
[02:00:50.923 --> 02:00:51.844]  People don't want war.
[02:00:51.904 --> 02:00:53.105]  It could trigger a larger deal.
[02:00:53.845 --> 02:00:57.667]  And then they have leftist articles attacking Tucker Carlson, making jokes about it.
[02:00:58.888 --> 02:01:02.509]  And then I made some calls to see if it was true, and it's absolutely true.
[02:01:02.970 --> 02:01:05.571]  And I'm not at liberty to get into the details, but it's worse than I thought.
[02:01:05.591 --> 02:01:08.953]  And Trump is just completely surrounded.
[02:01:09.833 --> 02:01:11.054]  It's a nightmare scenario.
[02:01:11.094 --> 02:01:13.295]  But just pulling back, as I asked earlier,
[02:01:15.234 --> 02:01:18.376]  What is the state of the world right now, do you think, with the different factions?
[02:01:19.896 --> 02:01:21.997]  Let me just comment first on Fox News.
[02:01:22.077 --> 02:01:25.139]  Fox News is a continual stream of neocon data.
[02:01:25.179 --> 02:01:27.040]  They have General Keen on pushing it.
[02:01:27.060 --> 02:01:29.881]  They have Jennifer Garner pushing war with Iran.
[02:01:30.722 --> 02:01:33.803]  This is just a propaganda stunt for war.
[02:01:33.883 --> 02:01:37.405]  And Tucker Carlson is the lone person who's questioning these types of things.
[02:01:38.201 --> 02:01:41.444]  And so people have to be very, very careful.
[02:01:41.484 --> 02:01:46.749]  They've garnered a tremendous audience of conservatives at Fox News, but they are being propagandized.
[02:01:46.769 --> 02:01:49.832]  And this leads me to my bigger problem in the big picture here.
[02:01:51.313 --> 02:01:56.418]  I'm beginning to sadly say, Alex, that our big problem is Donald Trump.
[02:01:57.276 --> 02:02:00.018]  And the reason, I said, not because Donald Trump is compromised.
[02:02:00.038 --> 02:02:07.623]  Donald Trump is highly manipulated because of his lack of experience because he comes to the White House being unprepared.
[02:02:07.663 --> 02:02:08.804]  He doesn't know the arguments.
[02:02:08.864 --> 02:02:10.345]  He doesn't have the conservative background.
[02:02:10.385 --> 02:02:11.806]  He doesn't know the proper people.
[02:02:12.106 --> 02:02:13.928]  He can't tell who's deep state and who isn't.
[02:02:14.268 --> 02:02:23.134]  The problem is Donald Trump is the 900-pound gorilla in the room and no one can capture and direct the conservative movement while Donald Trump is in place.
[02:02:23.975 --> 02:02:25.616]  He has made wonderful promises.
[02:02:26.585 --> 02:02:30.067]  And hardly any of them have been able to be fulfilled, even though he's tried.
[02:02:30.087 --> 02:02:34.069]  I mean, who would have even tried to get rid of birthright citizens but Donald Trump?
[02:02:34.089 --> 02:02:38.912]  But then he completely failed us when they pushed back on him and he let it drop.
[02:02:39.773 --> 02:02:43.855]  And so what I'm saying is that we continue to lose under Donald Trump.
[02:02:43.935 --> 02:02:46.557]  But the promises are so grand.
[02:02:47.037 --> 02:02:48.998]  The promises are so euphoric.
[02:02:49.668 --> 02:02:53.190]  That no one will countenance even criticism of Donald Trump.
[02:02:53.210 --> 02:02:54.971]  You know what it does to your subscriber base.
[02:02:55.071 --> 02:02:59.814]  I know what it does to mine, even when I criticize him on principle.
[02:02:59.874 --> 02:03:08.559]  But this is our major problem now, is that Donald Trump is going to take us to war with Iran, and it's going to be damaging, ultimately, to his presidency.
[02:03:09.579 --> 02:03:12.621]  But it may well get him another four years.
[02:03:13.161 --> 02:03:14.282]  Here's the danger, Alex.
[02:03:15.131 --> 02:03:29.984]  If Donald Trump continues to capture and dominate the conservative movement, because there is no room for any leader while he's there, and he takes us through another four years, it will be too late after that point to resurrect the conservative movement.
[02:03:30.204 --> 02:03:31.005]  No, I think you're right.
[02:03:31.025 --> 02:03:37.330]  If we don't get the changes in now, then it'll basically, the two-party system's over.
[02:03:37.491 --> 02:03:38.431]  It's going to be one or the other.
[02:03:39.172 --> 02:03:40.033]  The decision's been made.
[02:03:41.229 --> 02:03:49.638]  Well, the problem is is that the Democrats will have an absolute majority and a president and control of all both houses of Congress.
[02:03:49.658 --> 02:03:52.762]  And I'll tell you, it's going to be like an avalanche of legislation.
[02:03:52.822 --> 02:03:53.542]  And they've said that.
[02:03:53.582 --> 02:03:55.024]  They said, wait till we get in in 2024.
[02:03:55.444 --> 02:03:55.665]  It's over.
[02:03:57.921 --> 02:03:59.223]  And look at what they're talking about.
[02:03:59.243 --> 02:04:01.146]  They're talking about slavery reparations.
[02:04:01.586 --> 02:04:06.974]  They're so embarrassed about it that the DNC spokesman wouldn't even admit that they were for slavery.
[02:04:06.994 --> 02:04:08.776]  They just said, we're for the conversation.
[02:04:08.836 --> 02:04:10.098]  I saw that this morning with Hemmer.
[02:04:10.138 --> 02:04:12.181]  She said, we're for the conversation.
[02:04:13.038 --> 02:04:15.139]  We're for the... and he pressed her two or three times.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:19.843]  We're for the conversation, but they would not say they were for it because this is dangerous stuff.
[02:04:20.383 --> 02:04:26.447]  And so is all the socialist garbage, whether it's the Green Climate Deal or... Well, let's say your grandfather shot somebody.
[02:04:26.827 --> 02:04:32.591]  How are you responsible for what they did, much less when almost no one in the country has ancestors that had slaves?
[02:04:32.651 --> 02:04:33.372]  It's asinine.
[02:04:34.594 --> 02:04:34.914]  That's right.
[02:04:34.994 --> 02:04:39.136]  It's a new welfare system for blacks and it hasn't done anything for the black community.
[02:04:39.216 --> 02:04:45.319]  Look what it's done for the marriage when these women can be abandoned by their husbands and go on welfare for child support.
[02:04:45.859 --> 02:04:46.900]  And it just progenerates.
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:47.520]  So let's talk about it.
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:53.603]  Is there any way out of the multicultural globalist paradigm they brought us into with Joel Skousen back in 60 seconds?
[02:05:04.112 --> 02:05:09.976]  InfoWars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[02:05:10.756 --> 02:05:14.779]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[02:05:15.420 --> 02:05:19.182]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[02:05:20.063 --> 02:05:25.370]  To have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[02:05:25.911 --> 02:05:29.936]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS.
[02:05:30.036 --> 02:05:36.124]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, InfoWars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[02:05:36.945 --> 02:05:37.786]  And so we've reached that point.
[02:05:38.587 --> 02:05:40.407]  It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever.
[02:05:40.467 --> 02:05:42.208]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[02:05:42.568 --> 02:05:44.648]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[02:05:45.148 --> 02:05:46.169]  You have been there.
[02:05:46.509 --> 02:05:51.250]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault.
[02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:56.911]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now at Infowars.com.
[02:05:57.451 --> 02:05:58.091]  It's your fight.
[02:05:58.411 --> 02:06:02.732]  Decide whether or not you want Infowars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[02:06:08.197 --> 02:06:12.081]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:12.201 --> 02:06:20.089]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:47.556]  Joel Skousen is our guest, World Affairs Brief, and not just looking at the US or Trump, but looking at other leaders, the nationalists, the populist movement.
[02:06:48.056 --> 02:06:51.058]  Globalism is in trouble on some fronts, but they still have the power.
[02:06:52.259 --> 02:06:59.324]  How do you think globalism's dealing with the fact that their systems, the EU's in trouble, everywhere their system's in trouble?
[02:06:59.344 --> 02:07:01.225]  How do you think they'll deal with that, Joel?
[02:07:02.826 --> 02:07:04.287]  Well, we're seeing how they deal with it.
[02:07:04.327 --> 02:07:08.170]  They use their corrupt politicians to feign
[02:07:09.233 --> 02:07:10.874]  I mean, you look at the Brexit thing.
[02:07:10.894 --> 02:07:14.135]  Theresa May comes out and claims that I'm going to implement the Brexit.
[02:07:14.215 --> 02:07:15.675]  I'm going to be faithful to the Brexit.
[02:07:15.715 --> 02:07:17.576]  I mean, she's just lying to her teeth.
[02:07:18.156 --> 02:07:21.277]  And I fear strongly that Boris Johnson is doing the same thing.
[02:07:21.857 --> 02:07:23.658]  He's been on both sides of the issue.
[02:07:23.918 --> 02:07:26.198]  He's talking about being strong on Brexit.
[02:07:26.218 --> 02:07:29.800]  But I think it's another betrayal if Boris Johnson gets in.
[02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:31.981]  Take Faraj.
[02:07:32.041 --> 02:07:33.182]  Faraj is for real.
[02:07:33.723 --> 02:07:42.351]  Mainline News admits there have been four police-confirmed attempted assassinations, cutting brakes, taking the lug nuts off tires, off wheels.
[02:07:42.912 --> 02:07:44.413]  The airplane crash is suspicious.
[02:07:44.834 --> 02:07:49.458]  I mean, and he was told, we're going to kill you if you keep running for office, but now he's doing it again.
[02:07:49.819 --> 02:07:50.920]  I think Faraj is for real.
[02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:52.951]  Yeah, I do too.
[02:07:53.051 --> 02:07:54.472]  He's a powerful voice.
[02:07:54.552 --> 02:07:57.052]  Nobody can debate Nigel Farage.
[02:07:57.092 --> 02:07:58.453]  He just devastates them.
[02:07:58.473 --> 02:08:01.493]  He's got a steel trap mind that just won't stop.
[02:08:02.774 --> 02:08:06.515]  And that's why they won't allow him to, you know, get into real office on that.
[02:08:06.555 --> 02:08:10.756]  His Brexit party was really taking the wind out of the sails.
[02:08:10.796 --> 02:08:17.037]  And that's why, in fact, Boris Johnson even joined the Brexit party because he saw that as the wave of the future that he had to jump onto.
[02:08:17.057 --> 02:08:20.258]  And then he quickly jumped ship, went back to the Conservative Party when he got
[02:08:21.319 --> 02:08:24.189]  You know, put in as front-runner for the Prime Minister.
[02:08:24.270 --> 02:08:26.337]  Oh yeah, Boris Johnson's an obvious leftist.
[02:08:28.123 --> 02:08:39.451]  But, you know, it's the Deep State, which is tied in directly to Deep State in Germany and France, pulled out this honey trap for the members of the Freedom Party in Austria to destroy that coalition.
[02:08:39.471 --> 02:08:44.395]  I mean, these people have a tremendous amount of power, and we've seen a great deal of it come forward.
[02:08:44.975 --> 02:08:47.737]  Because of Donald Trump, they have to manipulate.
[02:08:47.757 --> 02:08:56.643]  We get to see them do this because of the Freedom Party and the French Le Pen, you know, the French National Party.
[02:08:59.238 --> 02:09:06.015]  They do their magic because they have real power and I don't think we need to, we mustn't underestimate the power of the deep state.
[02:09:06.638 --> 02:09:09.839]  They are ensconced in deeply within the CIA, the FBI.
[02:09:09.980 --> 02:09:10.560]  No, I agree.
[02:09:10.620 --> 02:09:11.840]  And so let me ask you this question.
[02:09:12.141 --> 02:09:21.265]  I think putting Trump in, putting the new Brazilian leader in, having the EU lose a lot of elections only enraged the establishment to move their timetable up that had been behind.
[02:09:21.605 --> 02:09:23.346]  Now, I think that means more people will wake up.
[02:09:23.486 --> 02:09:26.467]  I think that means more cracks in their system, more mistakes.
[02:09:26.487 --> 02:09:30.749]  But we shouldn't lie to ourselves that it's sleepy time and that everything's OK.
[02:09:30.889 --> 02:09:32.630]  I think the battle has just been joined.
[02:09:34.289 --> 02:09:44.156]  Well, clearly they're worried about the strength of you or they wouldn't be attacking you as they have with this planting trial pornography within your server so they can take you down on that.
[02:09:44.637 --> 02:09:50.861]  You know, destroying your financial base on YouTube, all of those things are directly affronts to free speech in this nation.
[02:09:51.442 --> 02:09:54.564]  And of course that's being shut down with political correctness as we see it.
[02:09:54.984 --> 02:10:00.088]  We're going to be like Canada pretty soon when you have ministers and pastors arrested for preaching against homosexuality.
[02:10:00.909 --> 02:10:03.691]  But the point I'm saying here is that
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:04.940]  I am.
[02:10:05.180 --> 02:10:10.482]  My greatest fear is that Donald Trump's going to be in for another four years and they're going to continue to manipulate him.
[02:10:10.943 --> 02:10:16.185]  And we're going to be left without a cause because it will too late four years from now.
[02:10:16.245 --> 02:10:20.186]  So we need to either get to Donald Trump and help straighten him out.
[02:10:21.567 --> 02:10:26.209]  I don't know, you know, how we we get around all of this.
[02:10:26.309 --> 02:10:28.750]  Well, Joe, let me tell you, and I'll be honest with you.
[02:10:28.790 --> 02:10:29.490]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:32.251]  We're still able to get him reports.
[02:10:32.391 --> 02:10:33.953]  We're still able to get him information.
[02:10:34.413 --> 02:10:36.175]  But that's why they want us off the air.
[02:10:36.616 --> 02:10:41.301]  And I don't want to say I've pulled back because of that, but it's like sticking your hand in a light socket.
[02:10:42.122 --> 02:10:45.426]  I just almost get overwhelmed by that.
[02:10:45.546 --> 02:10:48.049]  And how should I be putting briefings together?
[02:10:48.089 --> 02:10:49.271]  Maybe you should fly to Austin.
[02:10:49.691 --> 02:10:51.234]  You should shoot a few Bravies for the President.
[02:10:51.654 --> 02:10:55.660]  I should shoot a few really professional five-minute ones that show documents, that show evidence.
[02:10:56.101 --> 02:10:56.702]  You know how Trump is.
[02:10:56.762 --> 02:10:57.703]  It's got to be compelling.
[02:10:58.004 --> 02:10:59.907]  He's got to see stuff he already knows is real.
[02:11:00.167 --> 02:11:03.552]  And then we can sell him, you know, on ideas.
[02:11:03.592 --> 02:11:04.814]  Now the problem is, like you said,
[02:11:05.735 --> 02:11:08.656]  A month or so later, the next person that sells him, he'll go off that.
[02:11:08.736 --> 02:11:17.239]  It's really true that he's smart, and he knows what's going on, he has a good memory, but he's a salesman, but you can sell Donald Trump.
[02:11:17.299 --> 02:11:20.721]  People think he's hard to control, and I'm not saying I ever controlled the President.
[02:11:21.161 --> 02:11:23.862]  Anything I ever told him, he went and looked at and actually went with.
[02:11:24.202 --> 02:11:25.343]  That's why they're so horrified.
[02:11:25.543 --> 02:11:29.044]  And by the way, I'm not bragging about that, Joel, but I'm able to sell the President.
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:31.500]  Here's the problem.
[02:11:32.041 --> 02:11:34.482]  Donald Trump can't remember any of the detailed arguments.
[02:11:34.522 --> 02:11:36.223]  He can remember the big picture.
[02:11:36.243 --> 02:11:44.527]  He can come out and say things that are dearest to him for defending the right thing, but he can't remember any of the arguments.
[02:11:44.547 --> 02:11:49.469]  So he can't defend himself when he gets up against these very sophisticated globalist briefers.
[02:11:50.190 --> 02:11:52.731]  He just doesn't have the ability to do that.
[02:11:52.811 --> 02:11:56.293]  So he needs a few real advisors sitting at his side that know the full picture.
[02:11:57.011 --> 02:11:57.351]  That's right.
[02:11:57.811 --> 02:12:02.573]  I'm not bragging, Joel, but imagine what would happen if you were there as an advisor sitting next to him.
[02:12:02.874 --> 02:12:05.675]  Like, that's why they want to get rid of Stephen Miller.
[02:12:05.735 --> 02:12:08.736]  He's not that old or knows about all of it, but he's smart.
[02:12:08.956 --> 02:12:11.817]  They want him out of there because he's advising Trump on the border.
[02:12:11.837 --> 02:12:14.258]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:12:14.418 --> 02:12:20.821]  So they know that they can manipulate Donald Trump as long as he doesn't have someone sitting by their side who can counter their arguments.
[02:12:20.881 --> 02:12:22.462]  And I'll tell you, there would be hell to pay
[02:12:23.135 --> 02:12:38.865]  If they were to put someone like me in the White House, you know, they would plaster everything I've said about 9-11 or any conspiracy things without giving me a chance to defend myself, so that they could discredit you and embarrass Donald Trump, and then he'd have to remove you.
[02:12:39.445 --> 02:12:42.907]  They've got tremendous power because they control the media and the courts.
[02:12:43.487 --> 02:12:47.430]  They stop Donald Trump from every executive order that he tries to put through correctly.
[02:12:48.044 --> 02:12:50.366]  By threatening him with court action.
[02:12:50.386 --> 02:12:51.327]  Let me ask you this then.
[02:12:51.387 --> 02:12:53.229]  Do you think they're going to try to destroy him?
[02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:56.332]  Or do they think they can co-opt him now because he's wildly popular?
[02:12:58.454 --> 02:13:01.917]  I am fearful now that they're going to let him have another four years.
[02:13:01.977 --> 02:13:05.981]  And the only reason I say that, I've been asking in the World Affairs Brief for months now.
[02:13:06.581 --> 02:13:08.983]  Why are the Democrats shooting themselves in the foot?
[02:13:09.404 --> 02:13:09.884]  With 27 candidates?
[02:13:11.638 --> 02:13:14.619]  You know, why do they keep promoting socialism?
[02:13:15.159 --> 02:13:17.440]  Even the blue collar people are going to buy this stuff.
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:23.462]  They know that getting rid of automobiles and airplanes in even 30 years is going to destroy their jobs.
[02:13:23.482 --> 02:13:24.562]  They're not going to vote for this.
[02:13:25.502 --> 02:13:33.105]  And on this black slave reparations, I mean, they're so embarrassed about that they can't even commit to it openly without losing the election.
[02:13:33.165 --> 02:13:36.486]  So, I mean, they've got a death wish, it seems, unless
[02:13:37.367 --> 02:13:51.039]  They have concocted and say, look, you know, if we can control Donald Trump, we can perhaps bury the anti-globalist movement by him giving them the rhetoric and us turning them around and make sure that he never implements any of this.
[02:13:51.079 --> 02:13:52.580]  That's been the history of the three years.
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:54.081]  And that's what he does on censorship.
[02:13:54.121 --> 02:13:55.082]  He gives us a tweet.
[02:13:55.582 --> 02:13:56.643]  He tells us we're good.
[02:13:56.683 --> 02:13:58.184]  We get a phone call from the White House.
[02:13:58.625 --> 02:14:00.366]  But then the censorship just continues on.
[02:14:00.667 --> 02:14:03.329]  So it's kind of like giving us morphine when we're at hospice.
[02:14:04.494 --> 02:14:06.356]  Yeah, exactly, Alice.
[02:14:06.696 --> 02:14:12.061]  This is what I fear, is that Donald Trump is going to act as a placeholder, not knowingly.
[02:14:12.321 --> 02:14:13.902]  Donald Trump is not a controlled entertainer.
[02:14:13.942 --> 02:14:17.125]  Nobody can control Donald Trump, but he can be manipulated at the moment.
[02:14:17.745 --> 02:14:30.236]  And if he sits as a place sitter within the conservative and dominates the leadership for the next four years and does nothing in terms of getting the change that we need to stop this, it's going to be all over by 2024.
[02:14:32.978 --> 02:14:42.160]  I totally agree with you, and we just need people that are close to the President to do what's right, like Stephen Miller and Tucker Carlson and others.
[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.842]  And all of us, that means on the campaign trail, folks, that means in emails, calls the White House.
[02:14:46.902 --> 02:14:54.784]  Trump still, like he used to do in his buildings, because his dad taught him this, picks up the phone for like 30 minutes sometimes, an hour a night, while he eats cheeseburgers.
[02:14:55.484 --> 02:14:56.825]  And it's absolutely true.
[02:14:56.905 --> 02:15:03.107]  I'm bad too, but he eats like cheeseburgers, candy, ice cream up to like 2 a.m., and he answers the phone and reads newspapers.
[02:15:03.147 --> 02:15:06.388]  The guy's obviously an idiot savant when it comes to research and things.
[02:15:06.668 --> 02:15:15.592]  He's a dynamo at 73, but I'm telling you, it's a fight about getting info to him and then him being seconded on what he already thinks.
[02:15:15.632 --> 02:15:18.413]  But as Joel said, Trump even admits, I'm a very shallow person.
[02:15:18.453 --> 02:15:19.313]  I go with a gestalt.
[02:15:19.613 --> 02:15:20.353]  I go with my gut.
[02:15:20.613 --> 02:15:21.974]  Hey, Alex, what he says makes sense.
[02:15:22.014 --> 02:15:23.114]  What Tucker says makes sense.
[02:15:23.715 --> 02:15:23.935]  And then...
[02:15:24.875 --> 02:15:27.557]  You know, one minute I'm going to attack Iran, next minute, oh no I'm not.
[02:15:27.577 --> 02:15:34.983]  It's actually quite frightening when you really pull back and realize that Trump is something special.
[02:15:35.363 --> 02:15:37.445]  Joe Skousen, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:15:37.665 --> 02:15:40.027]  He's not Hillary, that's a great thing, but think if Hillary got in.
[02:15:40.307 --> 02:15:41.247]  We'd have opposition.
[02:15:41.768 --> 02:15:42.829]  We'd have people saying no.
[02:15:43.209 --> 02:15:44.170]  With Trump, we'd go to sleep.
[02:15:45.051 --> 02:15:45.631]  It's really true.
[02:15:45.832 --> 02:15:47.994]  Love Donald Trump, but Phil Skousen is dead right.
[02:15:49.416 --> 02:15:50.678]  One man can't save us.
[02:15:50.698 --> 02:15:52.540]  The one man is Jesus Christ that can do that.
[02:15:52.901 --> 02:15:54.142]  He's not a man, he's the Son of God.
[02:15:54.423 --> 02:15:55.604]  Phil Skousen, thank you so much.
[02:15:55.644 --> 02:15:56.285]  We appreciate you.
[02:15:57.006 --> 02:15:57.807]  My pleasure, Alex.
[02:15:58.268 --> 02:15:59.810]  We'll be back with huge news.
[02:15:59.830 --> 02:16:00.170]  Stay with us.
[02:16:07.213 --> 02:16:12.599]  I'm here in my parents' kitchen because my house flooded with torrential rains this week.
[02:16:13.380 --> 02:16:16.123]  So the flooded part of the house, they're having to fix that, so I've been staying over here.
[02:16:17.404 --> 02:16:24.012]  And I looked in my parents' cupboard and found that they were stocked up on some of the Enforced Life products.
[02:16:24.032 --> 02:16:24.812]  And I thought, wait a minute.
[02:16:25.453 --> 02:16:31.457]  I've been thinking about coming over to their house, because their kitchen is nicer than mine, and shooting a video about how amazing these products are.
[02:16:31.958 --> 02:16:35.060]  So I called Drew, one of our great camera people over at InfoWars this morning.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:40.844]  I said, hey, why don't you meet me over here, and I'm going to shoot a video I've been meaning to do for probably a year.
[02:16:40.864 --> 02:16:42.185]  So I'm like, I've got everything right here.
[02:16:43.502 --> 02:16:45.023]  It's time to show you what I personally do.
[02:16:45.504 --> 02:16:46.605]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:16:47.465 --> 02:16:56.794]  When I remember to take the supplements religiously, I lose weight, I'm healthy, my skin gets great, I have better stamina, libido, energy.
[02:16:57.454 --> 02:16:58.475]  I've never been a supplements guy.
[02:16:58.495 --> 02:17:02.799]  A lot of my big sponsors were supplement people, and I thought, well, why don't I try these then?
[02:17:03.139 --> 02:17:04.160]  And it turned out they were really good.
[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:07.723]  So we came out, as you know, six years ago with our own line of supplements.
[02:17:07.743 --> 02:17:09.104]  We've been expanding it ever since.
[02:17:09.124 --> 02:17:10.505]  And what we do is,
[02:17:11.386 --> 02:17:18.111]  Set out to already find what's the highest rated, already find what's the cleanest, what's the best, and then make it better, and then cut the price.
[02:17:18.611 --> 02:17:20.272]  And that's what we've done with these products.
[02:17:20.532 --> 02:17:30.479]  And that's why InfoWars live products are so highly rated by third party sites, that's why they're so popular with you, and it's also great because it funds our political operations, trying to stop the technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:36.601]  I always start taking the supplements and then I forget to take them.
[02:17:36.841 --> 02:17:46.210]  I either run out or I just get busy and then all of a sudden I'm not taking DNA Force, all of a sudden I'm not taking X2, I'm not taking Secret 12.
[02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:58.721]  That's why it's important for everybody out there that already knows they got great results with these high quality products and InfoWars Life or other supplements you've been taking to remember how good they were for you and your family and to get back into it.
[02:17:59.261 --> 02:18:06.644]  So today I just wanted to encourage everybody that's gotten great results with these products to just remember that because I need that reminder as well.
[02:18:07.184 --> 02:18:13.426]  One of the biggest things is I tend to go to the warehouse and get some of the products out for myself and then those run out and I forget.
[02:18:14.006 --> 02:18:15.947]  So now what I do, what my parents do, my
[02:18:16.847 --> 02:18:31.833]  And other people I know is they just put it on auto ship at Infowarslive.com, get an additional 10% off, and then you don't forget each month or every two months, however much you want to have it shipped to you, to get the product, support the show, and of course, also get 10% off.
[02:18:32.354 --> 02:18:39.817]  Now, some of the things I do is I don't really like soft drinks, because they got so much sugar in them, and I already have a problem with sweets sometimes.
[02:18:39.857 --> 02:18:42.278]  So, I really like soft drinks, what I'm proud to say is.
[02:18:43.138 --> 02:18:44.398]  I don't like the effects they have on me.
[02:18:44.999 --> 02:18:51.501]  So what I do is take something like a Perrier, lime or non-flavored, and I put it into a nice glass.
[02:18:53.402 --> 02:18:56.923]  And then I take the Ultra 12,
[02:18:58.854 --> 02:19:03.617]  And put in a whole dropper, and then I stir it up, and the flavor is incredible.
[02:19:04.097 --> 02:19:18.987]  So again, take your favorite sparkling water that doesn't have any calories in it, either flavored or unflavored, it all goes great with the flavor of natural vitamin B12 that has a sweet taste without any sugar or additives.
[02:19:19.027 --> 02:19:24.951]  You've got to experience Ultra 12 for yourself, you've got to experience X2 as well, and of course, X3.
[02:19:25.051 --> 02:19:26.772]  That's triiodine.
[02:19:27.472 --> 02:19:28.773]  Different strokes for different folks.
[02:19:29.173 --> 02:19:34.377]  Bottom line, these are all incredible products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[02:19:34.797 --> 02:19:42.663]  As I've said over and over again, it then funds an organization dedicated to exposing the globalists and their operations.
[02:19:42.703 --> 02:19:44.164]  That's why I thank you all for your support.
[02:19:44.184 --> 02:19:46.886]  I want to encourage you, if you haven't tried these products, to try them.
[02:19:46.906 --> 02:19:48.908]  And if you have tried them and, again, forgot,
[02:19:49.668 --> 02:19:51.389]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:20.606 --> 02:20:21.080]  We're good.
[02:20:36.443 --> 02:20:38.765]  I did tons of preparation last night.
[02:20:39.325 --> 02:20:40.546]  Tons of preparation this morning.
[02:20:41.587 --> 02:20:44.209]  The Iran situation has just dominated the whole broadcast.
[02:20:44.869 --> 02:20:48.032]  And I'm gonna end up hosting the fourth hour with Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL.
[02:20:48.832 --> 02:20:51.754]  Great mind about the situation unfolding.
[02:20:51.774 --> 02:20:53.496]  He'll probably have some different views, and that's fine.
[02:20:54.704 --> 02:20:59.630]  We're not a NXIVM cult, or like conservative radio, or liberal media.
[02:20:59.710 --> 02:21:10.883]  It's like a talking point comes out from Hillary, or a talking point comes out from George W. Bush, and then everyone just basically repeats that talking point over and over and over again.
[02:21:11.063 --> 02:21:12.325]  That's not what we're doing here.
[02:21:14.036 --> 02:21:19.858]  You know, I've got a clip from Blaze TV where they defend me and say, no, they subpoenaed his emails.
[02:21:20.198 --> 02:21:22.679]  Somebody sent hidden child porn.
[02:21:23.079 --> 02:21:25.120]  That happens to anybody that gets millions of emails.
[02:21:29.002 --> 02:21:34.604]  But then they go on in the video to make a bunch of statements about us that aren't true.
[02:21:35.924 --> 02:21:38.145]  So it's like these backhanded defenses.
[02:21:39.526 --> 02:21:42.547]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're coming after everybody.
[02:21:43.677 --> 02:21:44.297]  It's true blue.
[02:21:45.758 --> 02:22:05.547]  And again, I have thought long and hard about this for six months while we've been losing money from all the attacks, from all the censorship, from all the platforming, from everything, trying to keep our crew here, trying to actually expand for 2020 so we can have a big effect and catch all that critical footage on tape.
[02:22:07.568 --> 02:22:11.170]  And I've never been deceptive with our audience.
[02:22:12.412 --> 02:22:18.414]  Except I have, from time to time, withheld information that I don't think is good for the cause.
[02:22:20.614 --> 02:22:27.977]  Because, you know, it's not good for the cause that they've had an effect on slowing us down to a standstill and even having us start to contract.
[02:22:29.037 --> 02:22:32.438]  But see, there's something worse than the enemy knowing they're having an effect.
[02:22:33.418 --> 02:22:34.599]  Us being shut down, right?
[02:22:36.539 --> 02:22:38.880]  So, you notice all these years,
[02:22:40.111 --> 02:22:42.512]  Just running around during the break, my hair's all sticking up what's left of it.
[02:22:46.034 --> 02:22:48.636]  Over all these years, we've done such incredible things together.
[02:22:49.776 --> 02:22:50.757]  And we've changed the world.
[02:22:52.698 --> 02:23:00.742]  And I'll be damned, no taking the Lord's name in vain there, I mean that, before I'm going to ever give up.
[02:23:01.763 --> 02:23:02.904]  And the truth is, I know.
[02:23:03.803 --> 02:23:13.488]  That if you ever see me really get arrested, really get set up, or if I ever got my head blown off, God forbid, I don't want that to happen, that we'd see support way greater than we even need.
[02:23:15.890 --> 02:23:17.270]  But I don't want to get to that point.
[02:23:17.691 --> 02:23:23.534]  You know, I've told you that I've got intelligence agencies, criminals that have hijacked our government working against me.
[02:23:24.414 --> 02:23:28.076]  Now listen, you don't just think it's the child porn stuff, do you?
[02:23:30.838 --> 02:23:30.898]  No.
[02:23:32.691 --> 02:23:34.512]  By the way, I'm not a victim, I'm a target.
[02:23:34.772 --> 02:23:37.673]  Tommy Robinson said that a year ago when they tortured him in prison for three months.
[02:23:38.273 --> 02:23:42.015]  He lost, like, 12 stones or whatever.
[02:23:42.075 --> 02:23:42.275]  How much?
[02:23:42.295 --> 02:23:43.295]  It was like 30-something pounds.
[02:23:45.536 --> 02:23:52.859]  They put him in the Islamic area by the mosque, inside the area, and they would crap and defecate and throw feces at him through the bars, and the guards laughed at him.
[02:23:56.601 --> 02:23:59.362]  I remember when I saw Tommy on Fox News on Tucker Carlson first.
[02:24:02.796 --> 02:24:06.378]  Tommy looked like those guys you'd seen have been captured by the North Vietnamese for five years.
[02:24:06.398 --> 02:24:08.179]  They had that crazy look and they're all freaked out.
[02:24:08.659 --> 02:24:13.602]  It took Tommy, who's tough, months to get over what happened to him.
[02:24:13.622 --> 02:24:15.482]  They left the lights on 24 hours a day.
[02:24:15.523 --> 02:24:16.983]  They'd bang on the door continually.
[02:24:17.544 --> 02:24:22.026]  They'd shove feces and piss through the bars at him and laugh at him.
[02:24:25.688 --> 02:24:26.868]  And he was in solitary confinement.
[02:24:26.908 --> 02:24:29.890]  They let him out for three months and they were putting stuff in his food.
[02:24:31.544 --> 02:24:32.945]  He said it on air, but I talked to him privately.
[02:24:33.625 --> 02:24:35.506]  He ate some of the food that wasn't in a tin.
[02:24:35.526 --> 02:24:43.992]  Because once a day, he'd get a small tin of tuna fish and a little small package of crackers.
[02:24:44.032 --> 02:24:46.993]  That's all he'd eat because everything else had poison in it.
[02:24:48.154 --> 02:24:52.136]  Because he ate some once, he got so hungry, he had food poisoning and almost died.
[02:24:52.156 --> 02:24:59.481]  And let me tell you, when you're in a cage and people are poisoning you, and Muslims are defecating on the floor and throwing turds at you,
[02:25:01.044 --> 02:25:02.485]  Look how skinny he was when he came out of there.
[02:25:03.905 --> 02:25:06.186]  That's when you realize your government is evil.
[02:25:07.526 --> 02:25:16.769]  All you do is stand up for what's right and kidnap little girls and he identified the guy that killed a little girl and cut her up and put soulder flesh on beef kebabs.
[02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:21.031]  Turned out that guy got indicted for that and it was true.
[02:25:22.688 --> 02:25:29.754]  When Tommy first said, yeah, I talked to the locals, they cut that little girl up and fed her kebabs, the New Year's like, oh, our little Muslims wouldn't do that.
[02:25:29.794 --> 02:25:31.795]  They wouldn't cut up a little girl into kebabs.
[02:25:32.135 --> 02:25:33.196]  You bet they did!
[02:25:36.699 --> 02:25:38.120]  So I don't think of myself as a victim.
[02:25:39.081 --> 02:25:43.464]  And I haven't been in a jail cell for three months with people using it as a toilet.
[02:25:45.426 --> 02:25:48.809]  Tommy told me privately, he talked about it on air a little bit, but he said privately, there would be
[02:25:50.538 --> 02:25:53.321]  Four inches of human feces and urine by the end of the day.
[02:25:54.322 --> 02:25:58.446]  And every couple days they'd come in and give him a sweeper and say, clean that up.
[02:25:58.706 --> 02:26:00.728]  And he'd shove it out in the hall and put it in a bucket.
[02:26:00.968 --> 02:26:02.409]  That was his time outside the jail cell.
[02:26:03.010 --> 02:26:08.375]  With Muslims just putting their butts up against the bars and just crapping through the food hole on him.
[02:26:08.855 --> 02:26:10.117]  And laughing and giggling.
[02:26:10.437 --> 02:26:11.898]  That's the new world order, folks.
[02:26:12.299 --> 02:26:13.360]  That's what they do to patriots.
[02:26:15.703 --> 02:26:20.627]  Is they go and they piss all over you and they crap all over you and the media loves it!
[02:26:24.451 --> 02:26:26.212]  Well guess what I get to put up with now?
[02:26:27.794 --> 02:26:32.638]  The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and the AP saying I sent child porn to children.
[02:26:32.658 --> 02:26:37.182]  It's all a damn lie.
[02:26:37.202 --> 02:26:38.923]  9.6 million emails since Sandy Hook happened.
[02:26:40.044 --> 02:26:41.406]  Judge ordered them all turned over.
[02:26:41.426 --> 02:26:42.226]  I went back
[02:26:43.371 --> 02:26:44.172]  Seven, eight times.
[02:26:44.532 --> 02:26:46.353]  To the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:26:47.454 --> 02:26:50.235]  And said, I cannot give you all my people's emails.
[02:26:50.716 --> 02:26:51.436]  She said, fine.
[02:26:52.297 --> 02:26:53.477]  Twenty-something search terms.
[02:26:53.597 --> 02:26:55.118]  All the names of people involved.
[02:26:55.859 --> 02:26:57.440]  And they got 57,000 emails.
[02:26:57.500 --> 02:27:02.503]  And they had hidden, encoded child porn on there that I never opened.
[02:27:02.523 --> 02:27:10.468]  I know you've already heard this, but imagine... The news then runs with that, they'll do anything.
[02:27:13.012 --> 02:27:13.732]  But enough about that.
[02:27:14.473 --> 02:27:18.234]  I'll be here next hour when Trump gives his press conference, are we going to a war with Iran?
[02:27:18.254 --> 02:27:21.775]  And I'm not here telling you how bad these guys are to scare you.
[02:27:22.916 --> 02:27:26.857]  You know, the globalists always used to say, I was told, oh, Jones just scares people for us.
[02:27:27.237 --> 02:27:31.419]  No, I believe that you'd get motivated and angry about this because you're like me.
[02:27:31.939 --> 02:27:32.379]  I'm like you.
[02:27:33.666 --> 02:27:34.706]  We're like our ancestors.
[02:27:35.006 --> 02:27:37.947]  So I tell you, sometimes they'll come and they'll say, do you want the bad news?
[02:27:38.067 --> 02:27:39.347]  I've told every one of my crew members.
[02:27:39.407 --> 02:27:43.048]  I said, listen, there's one thing will get you fired quicker than anything around here.
[02:27:44.968 --> 02:27:45.228]  One thing.
[02:27:46.369 --> 02:27:49.029]  And that's if you don't tell me bad news, I want to know it.
[02:27:49.169 --> 02:27:51.230]  I want to meet it head on.
[02:27:51.970 --> 02:27:53.070]  And I think you're just like me.
[02:27:53.570 --> 02:27:57.631]  So when I sit here and come to you every day and report to you all this stuff that's going on.
[02:27:58.587 --> 02:28:04.892]  I don't need to report on the great baby that was born, the great life somebody had, or some new invention, or how great humanity is.
[02:28:04.952 --> 02:28:05.492]  We know that.
[02:28:05.893 --> 02:28:07.794]  I'm going to tell you what the enemy's doing.
[02:28:08.875 --> 02:28:16.281]  I'm going to tell you the bad things they're doing because I believe in you, and I believe you're going to change it.
[02:28:18.010 --> 02:28:20.891]  I believe in you, and I believe you're going to fight back against it.
[02:28:21.612 --> 02:28:23.152]  I believe we're going to stop this Iran war.
[02:28:23.512 --> 02:28:25.213]  I believe we're going to turn our economy back.
[02:28:25.573 --> 02:28:27.034]  I believe we're going to find Jesus again.
[02:28:27.654 --> 02:28:30.956]  I believe we're going to release all the secret technologies and life extension they've already got.
[02:28:31.476 --> 02:28:37.658]  I believe we're going to ban glyphosates and bring out all the clean, healthy farming equipment systems we have.
[02:28:38.999 --> 02:28:44.341]  I believe in you, and you believe in me, and we've done something the enemy fears, because we are not just the spirit of 1776.
[02:28:46.328 --> 02:28:48.871]  For the spirit of human destiny and will.
[02:28:49.712 --> 02:28:51.414]  My ancestors did a lot to get us here.
[02:28:52.275 --> 02:28:53.716]  Your ancestors did a hell of a lot.
[02:28:54.417 --> 02:28:55.518]  We're not going to be failures.
[02:28:55.859 --> 02:28:56.980]  We're not going to let them down.
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:58.081]  We're going to win.
[02:28:58.542 --> 02:29:00.704]  We'll be back with the new Homeland Attack.
[02:29:00.724 --> 02:29:01.084]  Stay with us.
[02:29:07.577 --> 02:29:10.198]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:29:10.558 --> 02:29:15.519]  InfoWare settles the Frog lawsuit, pays tiny settlement to creator Matt Fury.
[02:29:15.619 --> 02:29:17.220]  Mark, overall, what do you think of this decision?
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:17.860]  Mark Rendazzo.
[02:29:17.980 --> 02:29:28.003]  I mean, look, when they come at us first saying they want $1.2 million in attorney's fees, and then they wind up begging us for a pittance of a settlement.
[02:29:28.964 --> 02:29:30.926]  I think that's grounds for a victory lap.
[02:29:31.326 --> 02:29:34.628]  I mean, the amount that you wound up paying them for a licensing fee.
[02:29:34.648 --> 02:29:44.075]  I mean, when we were calculating what it would have cost for, you know, your first class flight to L.A., the kind of hotels that we like to stay in and the kind of meals we like to eat.
[02:29:44.135 --> 02:29:46.557]  I think our bar tab would have been more than that in L.A.
[02:29:46.577 --> 02:29:47.197]  just for the week.
[02:29:47.417 --> 02:29:55.063]  I just have a very big feeling of satisfaction when they put as many lawyers on the other side of the table as I have in my entire firm.
[02:29:56.604 --> 02:30:02.526]  And then they squeak out the door with a, you know, essentially it was like you flipped a coin to him and said, here, kid, get out of my way.
[02:30:02.546 --> 02:30:03.947]  Go buy yourself an ice cream.
[02:30:04.047 --> 02:30:12.411]  The thing you were saying earlier about how your viewers and your listeners helped out in order to help you win this free speech fight, I can't reiterate that enough.
[02:30:12.531 --> 02:30:19.074]  You know, when you have stood up on these cases, you're not standing up just for Alex Jones or Infogirls.
[02:30:19.354 --> 02:30:20.835]  You're standing up for everybody's rights.
[02:30:21.575 --> 02:30:27.576]  And, uh, you know, now that this case is over, you know, you can kind of start reloading the guns, but there's gonna be more.
[02:30:27.656 --> 02:30:28.176]  You know that.
[02:30:28.396 --> 02:30:28.916]  Well said.

[02:31:35.058 --> 02:31:35.859]  I want them muted.
[02:31:35.879 --> 02:31:37.719]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:31:38.099 --> 02:31:38.939]  Banning people.
[02:31:39.239 --> 02:31:44.421]  They're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have.
[02:31:48.061 --> 02:31:52.242]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[02:31:55.263 --> 02:31:56.043]  Spreading articles.
[02:31:56.083 --> 02:31:56.883]  Spreading videos.

[02:32:02.532 --> 02:32:05.773]  It's going to do something terrible like help Trump get re-elected.
[02:32:05.813 --> 02:32:09.155]  That's really what all this is about.
[02:32:09.475 --> 02:32:20.219]  ...said that they deem our content and our brand un... ...is the right to be, do, and say whatever you want.
[02:32:20.299 --> 02:32:21.640]  It's about freedom of expression.
[02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:24.921]  I'm a journalist.
[02:32:24.941 --> 02:32:28.983]  I'm a left not interested in telling the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype.
[02:32:31.337 --> 02:32:34.739]  They can say whatever they think and I respect their constitutional right to do it.
[02:32:34.759 --> 02:32:50.327]  I hope they respect my constitutional right.
[02:32:54.229 --> 02:32:58.151]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:06.112 --> 02:33:08.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.483 --> 02:33:24.385]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:24.826 --> 02:33:26.527]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.969 --> 02:33:34.193]  You know, everybody's got ancestors that were abused by people.
[02:33:35.575 --> 02:33:37.936]  And everybody's got ancestors that did bad things.
[02:33:39.297 --> 02:34:00.787]  Hell, all of us have done good things and bad things, but the idea that there were slaves all over the world 200 years ago, and that the West was who ended it, and now because the system knows the West is guilty, because the West has a conscience, it doesn't matter that Sudan's got slavery going on, or
[02:34:02.924 --> 02:34:05.686]  Somalia or Libya, because that's black people selling blacks.
[02:34:05.766 --> 02:34:06.607]  That's okay.
[02:34:09.249 --> 02:34:22.020]  But if your great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great granddaddy did something wrong, we're going to have a genealogy run and you're going to pay some money.
[02:34:23.361 --> 02:34:24.702]  Wow, that's crazy.
[02:34:26.844 --> 02:34:29.966]  USA Today, Africans are being sold at Libyan slave markets.
[02:34:30.026 --> 02:34:30.867]  Thanks, Hillary Clinton.
[02:34:32.145 --> 02:34:33.125]  That's USA Today.
[02:34:34.466 --> 02:34:38.988]  If our government said, hey, let's go free those people.
[02:34:39.028 --> 02:34:41.850]  Don't buy them, because that puts a market out there and makes the price go up.
[02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:43.391]  But let's go free those people.
[02:34:44.991 --> 02:34:53.716]  If some of our military volunteered to go on missions to go kill those slave camp owners, who are black, and free those folks, I'm all for it.
[02:34:54.616 --> 02:34:57.418]  But man, I'm sure sick of hearing about how I did something wrong.
[02:34:58.138 --> 02:34:59.919]  If my great-great-great-great-grandfather
[02:35:01.138 --> 02:35:03.000]  That only takes you back to after slavery.
[02:35:04.881 --> 02:35:05.542]  Was a murderer.
[02:35:08.905 --> 02:35:10.767]  Let's say he killed two or three innocent people.
[02:35:10.787 --> 02:35:11.167]  He didn't.
[02:35:13.029 --> 02:35:13.709]  Don't even know his name.
[02:35:13.890 --> 02:35:15.051]  But let's just say he did.
[02:35:16.412 --> 02:35:25.240]  How am I guilty if somebody's far distant relative, who's like 5% the genetics of this person, shows up and says,
[02:35:28.601 --> 02:35:31.183]  Your great-great-great-great-great-granddaddy did something.
[02:35:31.203 --> 02:35:37.006]  Hell, if my daddy robbed a bank and I didn't know about it, I don't go to jail.
[02:35:42.550 --> 02:35:43.810]  What type of system is this?
[02:35:44.311 --> 02:35:46.092]  I haven't even gotten all the reparation videos.
[02:35:46.532 --> 02:35:48.313]  I'll play some of those coming up next segment.
[02:35:48.693 --> 02:35:51.375]  I'm going to be hosting the fourth hour here waiting for Trump's press conference.
[02:35:54.677 --> 02:35:55.618]  It's the in-the-due process.
[02:35:57.288 --> 02:35:58.989]  And it sins the forefathers.
[02:35:59.109 --> 02:36:06.035]  And, you know, are we going to find out if these black people brought here, if their own family sold them to sex slavery or slavery or whatever?
[02:36:06.055 --> 02:36:08.737]  Are we going to come after them?
[02:36:08.757 --> 02:36:11.118]  Because there were black slaveholders in the U.S.
[02:36:11.158 --> 02:36:11.459]  as well.
[02:36:12.399 --> 02:36:15.161]  It's just crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:15.422 --> 02:36:24.949]  And by the way, I've got all these videos coming up next segment of Africans fighting Mexican troops to get into Mexico, to get into the U.S.
[02:36:26.783 --> 02:36:28.824]  Are they going to show up and demand those reparations?
[02:36:29.245 --> 02:36:32.847]  Damn it, I came in here and I'm going to get a reparation!
[02:36:33.688 --> 02:36:37.990]  You're only going to get that welfare and the rest of it because the state wants people under its control.
[02:36:38.711 --> 02:36:44.355]  The state wants people that are going to show up and demand their free goody, whether they're white or black or whatever it is.
[02:36:45.315 --> 02:36:47.356]  That's coming up next segment, but let me go to this piece first.
[02:36:49.698 --> 02:36:55.582]  I have never sat down and watched the hit TV series that's ending, I guess, around now, Homeland.
[02:36:56.886 --> 02:37:00.727]  When they started it five, six years ago, they said it's based on Alex Jones.
[02:37:02.487 --> 02:37:05.428]  It's some British actor trying to do his Texas accent.
[02:37:05.468 --> 02:37:06.728]  It's a bad Southern accent.
[02:37:10.028 --> 02:37:16.570]  And in the show, he lies and he cheats and he puts out fake news like the corporate media does.
[02:37:18.030 --> 02:37:23.531]  And then the corporate media comes for Hillary Clinton, who's the president, and says, we'll just buy you off.
[02:37:24.947 --> 02:37:27.268]  I never saw the rest of the episode, but he doesn't say what he wants.
[02:37:29.088 --> 02:37:30.069]  And they tell him, you're going to lose.
[02:37:30.089 --> 02:37:30.889]  You're going to be shut down.
[02:37:30.909 --> 02:37:32.209]  And in the end, he is shut down.
[02:37:32.249 --> 02:37:32.989]  He's put in prison.
[02:37:33.009 --> 02:37:35.450]  And in the final season, I don't even know what happens.
[02:37:35.470 --> 02:37:36.851]  I've just read the synopses of it.
[02:37:37.891 --> 02:37:39.071]  People say, why don't you watch a show?
[02:37:39.151 --> 02:37:39.712]  It's about you.
[02:37:40.112 --> 02:37:42.392]  Well, hell, Chris Carter was pissed about Homeland.
[02:37:43.753 --> 02:37:48.694]  So three and a half years ago during the campaign, he put out the new X-Files where I'm the good guy.
[02:37:48.714 --> 02:37:51.975]  And he said, this character is based on Alex Jones, and Alex Jones is a libertarian.
[02:37:52.335 --> 02:37:54.356]  He gets things wrong sometimes, but he means well.
[02:37:55.845 --> 02:38:00.126]  Now that show had many times the viewers of Homeland, but Chris Carter didn't get picked back up.
[02:38:01.546 --> 02:38:02.466]  Chris Carter wanted to meet.
[02:38:02.666 --> 02:38:03.767]  I'm not name-dropping.
[02:38:03.787 --> 02:38:05.147]  I just never had time to go out to California.
[02:38:05.167 --> 02:38:05.627]  I should have done it.
[02:38:09.048 --> 02:38:13.789]  But that's the level of it where Chris Carter puts out a good Alex Jones, the show's ahead, it gets canceled.
[02:38:14.289 --> 02:38:15.289]  The relaunch of X-Files.
[02:38:15.909 --> 02:38:19.430]  But the Homeland show on Showtime or whatever, they try to make it ahead.
[02:38:19.650 --> 02:38:22.070]  They did have a lot of views, but nothing compared to a Fox show.
[02:38:23.951 --> 02:38:24.851]  That's the reality of this.
[02:38:26.519 --> 02:38:34.041]  So think about the world we live in, in Fantasyland, where when I've been around Democrats and others, they believe I'm the homeland character.
[02:38:34.501 --> 02:38:39.642]  They believe I have a thousand employees and billions of dollars and I'm funded by the CIA and we're putting out lies.
[02:38:39.902 --> 02:38:40.402]  You're here.
[02:38:40.462 --> 02:38:43.083]  You're watching us say what we say, what we do.
[02:38:43.323 --> 02:38:44.483]  You're seeing what we cover.
[02:38:44.523 --> 02:38:46.524]  You're seeing everything we get into.
[02:38:48.144 --> 02:38:50.605]  It's me and the crew running the show and a few camera people.
[02:38:52.227 --> 02:38:56.290]  But the Democrats are telling you who they really are with projection.
[02:38:56.750 --> 02:39:11.261]  So when this smartsy, fancy-pants lawyer for Hillary, the female president, they were getting everybody ready for her, predictive programming, when she's there talking to the evil, homeland villain,
[02:39:14.582 --> 02:39:16.723]  They're talking about his fake news and how he should stop it.
[02:39:17.483 --> 02:39:19.724]  They're the people putting out fake news.
[02:39:20.084 --> 02:39:22.565]  They're the ones knowingly lying to you.
[02:39:22.585 --> 02:39:28.767]  I mean, they even set up the studio with our old graphics and our old everything.
[02:39:30.287 --> 02:39:31.768]  As a big joke, that's all they've got.
[02:39:31.788 --> 02:39:36.049]  But what's crazy is the left is so nuts, they see me in public and shake in anger.
[02:39:36.849 --> 02:39:41.951]  So here's that clip from a few seasons ago of Homeland where I don't take the offer to sell out.
[02:39:42.031 --> 02:39:42.351]  Here it is.
[02:39:45.188 --> 02:39:47.569]  Well, I like to think I'm filling a void.
[02:39:47.589 --> 02:39:51.570]  The one vacated by the walking dead and decrepit media.
[02:39:51.951 --> 02:39:52.731]  Come on, you're smart.
[02:39:52.931 --> 02:39:53.811]  You don't really believe that?
[02:39:54.171 --> 02:39:54.632]  Oh, I do.
[02:39:54.652 --> 02:39:56.392]  I do.
[02:39:56.892 --> 02:39:57.793]  People are angry.
[02:39:58.053 --> 02:39:58.713]  So you keep saying.
[02:39:59.814 --> 02:40:06.516]  Maybe they'd be a little less angry and a little more reasonable, these people, if you stopped peddling your outright falsehoods, conspiracy theories.
[02:40:06.736 --> 02:40:07.777]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:40:08.017 --> 02:40:08.437]  Seriously?
[02:40:10.197 --> 02:40:11.578]  You're poisoning the conversation.
[02:40:12.138 --> 02:40:13.279]  What conversation?
[02:40:13.660 --> 02:40:18.263]  We haven't had a conversation in this country for 50 years.
[02:40:18.603 --> 02:40:23.747]  Not since these people, as you keep calling them, got sent to fight the war in Vietnam.
[02:40:23.947 --> 02:40:27.609]  Not since their children were bused to schools in the ghetto.
[02:40:27.990 --> 02:40:30.391]  Not since their jobs were shipped overseas.
[02:40:30.571 --> 02:40:35.355]  Not since the Christian values they cherish were trashed and ridiculed.
[02:40:36.858 --> 02:40:41.361]  In favor of every boy who thinks he's a girl or girl who thinks she's a boy, well, f*** that.
[02:40:47.946 --> 02:40:48.346]  Fair enough.
[02:40:49.847 --> 02:40:50.347]  Fair enough?
[02:40:54.350 --> 02:40:56.771]  Every one of those things you just mentioned is worth talking about.
[02:40:57.632 --> 02:40:58.072]  Debating.
[02:40:59.793 --> 02:41:00.474]  Hear, hear!
[02:41:00.494 --> 02:41:04.837]  Instead, you're out there accusing the president of murdering General McClendon.
[02:41:06.064 --> 02:41:07.325]  Calling for a revolution?
[02:41:08.386 --> 02:41:08.586]  Hey.
[02:41:10.828 --> 02:41:11.749]  I serve my audience.
[02:41:13.290 --> 02:41:14.010]  That's your answer?
[02:41:14.391 --> 02:41:15.471]  That's the American way.
[02:41:17.113 --> 02:41:20.275]  Nothing ever got done in this country by civil discourse alone.
[02:41:20.535 --> 02:41:21.736]  The loud get heard.
[02:41:21.916 --> 02:41:22.777]  They always have.
[02:41:24.839 --> 02:41:26.220]  They also fall the hardest.
[02:41:29.022 --> 02:41:29.783]  Come and get me.
[02:41:31.044 --> 02:41:31.464]  Go ahead.
[02:41:32.649 --> 02:41:34.010]  Send in the stormtroopers.
[02:41:34.050 --> 02:41:34.971]  We'll see what happens.
[02:41:36.011 --> 02:41:37.072]  The world is watching.
[02:41:37.092 --> 02:41:38.393]  Not for long.
[02:41:38.413 --> 02:41:40.094]  What do you mean?
[02:41:40.114 --> 02:41:47.158]  Once we shut down your broadcast chamber communications, you'll be completely cut off.
[02:41:53.942 --> 02:41:54.643]  Here's the truth.
[02:42:05.373 --> 02:42:06.274]  Tell me what you want.
[02:42:09.156 --> 02:42:10.757]  What's it gonna take for you to walk out of here?
[02:42:20.904 --> 02:42:27.068]  And so I never watched Homeland, so I don't know how it ends, but see, that's the character they say is based on me, that they say is me.
[02:42:28.689 --> 02:42:29.970]  But see, I told you what I want.
[02:42:31.044 --> 02:42:36.206]  I want you to stop bankrupting the country, selling it out, teaching five-year-olds how to get blowjobs.
[02:42:36.827 --> 02:42:39.468]  I want you to stop putting glyphosate in everything and giving us cancer.
[02:42:39.928 --> 02:42:40.969]  I don't want the 5G.
[02:42:41.009 --> 02:42:41.849]  I don't want wars.
[02:42:42.209 --> 02:42:43.070]  I'm just a populist.
[02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:46.611]  I'm not the right-wing Nazi you say I am, and I'm not this stupid character.
[02:42:46.852 --> 02:42:49.833]  But off-record, they have offered me these exact deals.
[02:42:50.513 --> 02:42:53.755]  And this whole show, I later learned, was actually another threat.
[02:42:53.995 --> 02:42:55.115]  I didn't even watch it.
[02:42:55.676 --> 02:42:56.936]  I didn't watch all the other shows.
[02:42:57.277 --> 02:42:58.897]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:42:58.917 --> 02:42:59.678]  It's hilarious!
[02:43:02.381 --> 02:43:03.361]  You know what I was most proud of?
[02:43:04.401 --> 02:43:09.862]  For eight years, there wasn't one single hint of a scandal.
[02:43:11.203 --> 02:43:14.283]  President under pressure from a trifecta of scandals.
[02:43:14.303 --> 02:43:20.064]  President Barack Obama trying to get ahead of just one of the three scandals now consuming the country's attention.
[02:43:20.184 --> 02:43:25.145]  That scandal involving the Secret Service and accusations of drinking and hiring prostitutes in Colombia.
[02:43:25.245 --> 02:43:26.785]  The Obama spying scandal.
[02:43:26.885 --> 02:43:28.826]  The mother of all scandals, Spygate.
[02:43:28.846 --> 02:43:29.506]  This is a big
[02:43:30.066 --> 02:43:30.466]  Scandal.
[02:43:30.486 --> 02:43:31.467]  It's a huge scandal.
[02:43:31.487 --> 02:43:32.468]  The Gunn-Walker scandal.
[02:43:32.488 --> 02:43:33.189]  The VA scandal.
[02:43:33.229 --> 02:43:33.949]  The VA scandal.
[02:43:34.009 --> 02:43:38.733]  It's a scandal telling America you can keep your doctor, a callous deception that hurts millions.
[02:43:38.793 --> 02:43:43.216]  Today widespread embarrassment about this scandal has really turned to disgust.
[02:43:43.356 --> 02:43:49.401]  All of this comes as a White House that takes pride in being scandal-free has been hammered by a series of controversies.
[02:43:49.561 --> 02:43:50.042]  The latest?
[02:43:50.262 --> 02:43:58.048]  Revelations the Justice Department obtained two months of telephone records of reporters at the Associated Press as part of a leak investigation.
[02:43:58.388 --> 02:44:10.533]  I believe there's been a pattern by this administration in not taking responsibility for failures, avoiding blame, pointing the fingers in somebody else's direction.
[02:44:11.753 --> 02:44:12.454]  Would you agree with that?
[02:44:12.474 --> 02:44:13.914]  Uh, no.
[02:44:14.094 --> 02:44:14.815]  For eight years.
[02:44:15.515 --> 02:44:19.539]  There wasn't one single hint of a scandal.
[02:44:19.979 --> 02:44:32.271]  The CIA went in to walled off Senate computers in a bona fide investigation that's being done of the detention and interrogation of detainees.
[02:44:32.711 --> 02:44:38.437]  As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:44:38.937 --> 02:44:47.821]  CIA Director John Brennan apologized today after an internal investigation determined the agency had spied on staff members of the United States Senate.
[02:44:48.142 --> 02:44:50.543]  Firestorms surrounding the IRS.
[02:44:50.603 --> 02:44:53.064]  Last night, we asked if what they did was fair.
[02:44:53.144 --> 02:44:56.526]  Tonight, the FBI is asking, was it criminal?
[02:44:57.226 --> 02:45:01.570]  I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this.
[02:45:01.750 --> 02:45:11.359]  In the years before the election, more liberal groups were being approved, while conservative groups with names like Patriot, Constitution, and Tea Party were stymied.
[02:45:11.639 --> 02:45:14.322]  In 2011, not a single Tea Party group was approved.
[02:45:14.522 --> 02:45:23.885]  Operation Fast and Furious, an Obama administration program that let thousands of assault weapons fall into the hands of violent Mexican drug cartels.
[02:45:24.025 --> 02:45:28.687]  Guns found in over 170 crime scenes, including the murder of a U.S.
[02:45:28.767 --> 02:45:30.027]  Border Patrol agent.
[02:45:30.128 --> 02:45:37.030]  The Obama administration denied the program's existence and withheld information to protect political appointees.
[02:45:37.290 --> 02:45:39.651]  The Dallas Morning News calls this a cover-up.
[02:45:39.971 --> 02:45:41.812]  Will anyone be held accountable?
[02:45:43.232 --> 02:45:44.513]  Single hint.
[02:45:44.873 --> 02:45:47.195]  My main concern is fixing a problem.
[02:45:47.675 --> 02:45:54.160]  New questions over who is to blame for the deaths of some of America's most elite warriors in a helicopter crash.
[02:45:54.260 --> 02:45:59.924]  Their families suggest that the White House and others are lying about their deaths and what led to them.
[02:45:59.944 --> 02:46:06.009]  All of a sudden there's movies, SEAL Team 6, documentaries, SEAL Team 6, SEAL Team 6, this, this, this.
[02:46:06.669 --> 02:46:07.610]  Where did it all start?
[02:46:09.147 --> 02:46:17.793]  Joe Biden in Delaware in a tuxedo with a half a load on, telling everybody it was the elite Navy SEAL team.
[02:46:18.013 --> 02:46:21.476]  Now to the VA scandal, which is now a criminal investigation.
[02:46:21.536 --> 02:46:28.361]  An extensive new report reveals more than 100,000 veterans waited months to see a doctor or never saw one at all.
[02:46:28.781 --> 02:46:32.324]  And some workers saying they were pressured to falsify records.
[02:46:32.444 --> 02:46:36.247]  Now the VA scandal has officially become a criminal investigation.
[02:46:36.775 --> 02:46:40.336]  I think I'm either low IQ or slow or I don't know what I am, you know?
[02:46:40.736 --> 02:46:41.537]  Slow Joe Biden?
[02:46:42.157 --> 02:46:44.137]  Now, I have to tell you, he's a different guy.
[02:46:44.678 --> 02:46:46.378]  He looks different than he used to.
[02:46:46.918 --> 02:46:48.639]  He acts different than he used to.
[02:46:50.079 --> 02:46:51.540]  I had two cranial aneurysms.
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:55.061]  And they literally had to take the top of my head off.
[02:46:55.121 --> 02:46:57.021]  I mean, they take a saw and they cut your head off.
[02:46:57.041 --> 02:47:01.243]  Flawless victory.
[02:47:06.104 --> 02:47:10.146]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.128 --> 02:47:14.348]  Hey!
[02:47:14.508 --> 02:47:14.988]  Hey!
[02:47:15.068 --> 02:47:15.348]  Ah!
[02:47:15.448 --> 02:47:15.829]  Ah!
[02:47:15.889 --> 02:47:16.089]  Ah!
[02:47:25.011 --> 02:47:27.773]  Remember, we only reach through listeners with all the censorship.
[02:47:27.793 --> 02:47:29.254]  By your word of mouth, you are the InfoWarrant.
[02:47:29.474 --> 02:47:30.715]  I salute you and thank you.
[02:47:50.216 --> 02:47:51.557]  We've talked about this the last few days.
[02:47:51.597 --> 02:47:57.401]  They're actually having congressional hearings, led by Sheila Jackson Lee, about reparations.
[02:47:58.242 --> 02:48:09.911]  And the country's so horrible, and our concentration camps are so horrible, that all these black Africans, by the thousands a week, are showing up from the Congo and other areas, wanting to get into the concentration camp.
[02:48:12.403 --> 02:48:14.404]  Meanwhile, the Democrats are on record.
[02:48:14.424 --> 02:48:17.306]  I have another Democrat leader in Illinois saying they'll confiscate guns.
[02:48:17.967 --> 02:48:19.528]  Others saying they want to put us in camps.
[02:48:19.588 --> 02:48:22.670]  So it's only Democrats talking about all this.
[02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:25.231]  So you've got Africans that aren't looking like they're doing too bad.
[02:48:25.772 --> 02:48:31.215]  Some of them weigh about 300 pounds, bigger than I am, showing up at the Mexican border.
[02:48:31.235 --> 02:48:32.916]  We have audio of this for radio listeners?
[02:48:33.597 --> 02:48:36.659]  I mean, this is some dramatic stuff.
[02:48:38.032 --> 02:48:42.595]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Africans at the Guatemala border, demanding to come into Mexico.
[02:48:44.196 --> 02:48:47.098]  Bitching and yelling, saying, I want into the U.S.
[02:48:47.718 --> 02:48:48.599]  I want welfare.
[02:48:49.159 --> 02:48:50.300]  I'm going to have a baby.
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:48:51.660]  Give me the money.
[02:48:51.801 --> 02:48:54.122]  Get me into the racist country immediately.
[02:48:55.243 --> 02:48:56.123]  The evil white people.
[02:48:59.385 --> 02:49:01.727]  I mean, Trump has to start deporting these people.
[02:49:02.747 --> 02:49:04.769]  Because it'll just green light everybody else coming here.
[02:49:05.983 --> 02:49:07.664]  And Trump told Mexico, you better stop it.
[02:49:07.704 --> 02:49:08.684]  Well, the troops are down there.
[02:49:09.045 --> 02:49:12.907]  So I'll give Trump a big gold star for this.
[02:49:15.388 --> 02:49:17.749]  Meanwhile, there's another big study out at NewsWars.com.
[02:49:18.289 --> 02:49:23.152]  Vast majority of rejected asylum seekers in Europe not leaving.
[02:49:23.732 --> 02:49:25.293]  They're almost all military-aged men.
[02:49:25.333 --> 02:49:28.574]  That's at NewsWars.com and EuropeWars.com.
[02:49:28.614 --> 02:49:30.535]  A lot of exclusive information.
[02:49:30.555 --> 02:49:31.576]  Please bookmark those folks.
[02:49:32.472 --> 02:49:33.372]  But it's okay, video.
[02:49:33.472 --> 02:49:37.194]  Even students say AOC's concentration camps comment too extreme.
[02:49:37.474 --> 02:49:41.496]  But that's now an official Democratic Party talking point.
[02:49:42.717 --> 02:49:52.301]  So let's air and get the political spin here of mainstream news' boil down of what happened from Time Magazine.
[02:49:52.861 --> 02:49:56.323]  House Judiciary Committee holds hearing on reparations for slavery.
[02:49:56.503 --> 02:49:58.164]  Now understand, I know you know this, but
[02:49:59.443 --> 02:50:03.205]  Our rule of law, our due process, is already being shredded and funneled down a toilet.
[02:50:05.046 --> 02:50:13.632]  But if you can be guilty for some foggy ancestor 10 generations ago, Civil War is about 10 generations on average.
[02:50:14.672 --> 02:50:17.994]  And less than 2% of people have ancestors that own slaves.
[02:50:18.274 --> 02:50:18.895]  Doesn't matter.
[02:50:19.335 --> 02:50:22.097]  The government thinks, oh, blacks deserve this.
[02:50:22.537 --> 02:50:24.598]  It'll next be transgenders, this, that.
[02:50:24.818 --> 02:50:26.079]  Well, some gays were beat up.
[02:50:26.179 --> 02:50:29.001]  So, you know, it never ends.
[02:50:31.621 --> 02:50:32.842]  It's total mental illness.
[02:50:33.262 --> 02:50:37.625]  And they're not going to give black people anything other than breaking up your families and putting you in prison.
[02:50:37.885 --> 02:50:39.666]  The state wants to control you.
[02:50:41.167 --> 02:50:42.748]  It's like a fish hook with a worm on it.
[02:50:43.348 --> 02:50:44.989]  The fish thinks, oh, that's a free deal.
[02:50:45.109 --> 02:50:46.210]  No, that's not a free deal.
[02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:48.431]  That's a hook inside there.
[02:50:49.131 --> 02:50:49.992]  So look for the hook.
[02:50:50.412 --> 02:50:51.193]  So here's that pull down.
[02:50:52.113 --> 02:50:53.954]  There are diverse opinions in this room.
[02:50:54.995 --> 02:50:57.957]  And I understand it, appreciate it, respect it, admire it, and love it.
[02:50:58.577 --> 02:50:58.977]  Oh my God.
[02:50:58.997 --> 02:51:00.258]  I'm a product of my history.
[02:51:01.832 --> 02:51:05.458]  I am clearly a child that has walked this path.
[02:51:05.538 --> 02:51:08.022]  No, I did not pick cotton.
[02:51:08.723 --> 02:51:10.626]  She just loves to feel sorry for herself.
[02:51:10.646 --> 02:51:13.470]  Then get out of the country, you dumb witch!
[02:51:14.131 --> 02:51:14.893]  You rich witch!
[02:51:18.359 --> 02:51:24.060]  Decades of living in a community where you see how deeply unfair this nation is still.
[02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:25.461]  Ah, Cory Booker fills his arm for himself.
[02:51:25.581 --> 02:51:28.902]  So many people who struggle, who work hard.
[02:51:28.922 --> 02:51:32.142]  Can we show footage of people trying to get into the country, please?
[02:51:32.182 --> 02:51:35.963]  Disproportionately with lead in their water, super funds in their neighborhood.
[02:51:35.983 --> 02:51:36.824]  Oh, wait, pause again.
[02:51:37.524 --> 02:51:39.384]  The liberals say I'm wrong to say filter your water.
[02:51:39.424 --> 02:51:42.205]  You think black people only once got lead?
[02:51:42.245 --> 02:51:44.505]  I don't care whether you're black, white, or an Easter Bunny, man.
[02:51:44.806 --> 02:51:46.206]  The damn water's full of crap.
[02:51:46.971 --> 02:52:03.463]  Well, it's a lot better than Latin America or the Dominican Republic, that's majority black, where black people, white people, Hispanics have died by the hundreds, it's hundreds now, because they're putting poison, they're putting wood alcohol in the liquor.
[02:52:04.985 --> 02:52:06.105]  And what do you think's getting sold?
[02:52:06.145 --> 02:52:09.448]  Down in the third world, nobody gives a damn about what happens to anybody.
[02:52:11.647 --> 02:52:13.068]  That's why you want to get in here.
[02:52:13.568 --> 02:52:15.169]  But see, we're just becoming just like that.
[02:52:15.469 --> 02:52:18.670]  And then Cory Booker sits there like a big, fat, bitchin' baby.
[02:52:19.791 --> 02:52:24.433]  Talkin' about how bad America is and how he's gonna promise people some free goodies.
[02:52:25.633 --> 02:52:29.175]  All he's gonna do is lock your ass in prison like Democrats always do black people.
[02:52:30.175 --> 02:52:35.758]  Cory Booker's an Uncle Tom for the Democratic Party to keep black people on the plantation and he knows his job.
[02:52:39.019 --> 02:52:40.580]  Let's go ahead and go back to Cory.
[02:52:42.128 --> 02:52:42.548]  Genius.
[02:52:42.789 --> 02:52:47.352]  Healthcare disparities that still affect their body and their well-being.
[02:52:47.672 --> 02:52:54.878]  We as a nation must address these persistent inequalities or we will never fully achieve the strength and the possibility.
[02:52:54.898 --> 02:52:55.339]  Pause again!
[02:52:55.739 --> 02:52:56.339]  We suck!
[02:52:56.780 --> 02:52:57.941]  America's bad, Corey!
[02:52:58.001 --> 02:52:59.182]  Go to Africa, bro!
[02:53:00.518 --> 02:53:00.898]  Oh no!
[02:53:01.658 --> 02:53:03.419]  There's no electricity there, right Jack?
[02:53:03.739 --> 02:53:11.281]  There's always some temple with some rich guy with 500 limousines and 100 Ferraris and 200 women with guys with machine guns.
[02:53:11.301 --> 02:53:14.401]  You all walking there arrogant to him, he'll say, cook him on the spit.
[02:53:14.881 --> 02:53:15.722]  He'll run his mouth.
[02:53:17.922 --> 02:53:20.063]  Black dictators like to talk bad about black people.
[02:53:22.203 --> 02:53:22.523]  You!
[02:53:23.644 --> 02:53:29.125]  You sit here and you bitch and you complain against the country and against the West that outlawed slavery.
[02:53:30.026 --> 02:53:32.628]  While you whine and complain because you're a pimp.
[02:53:33.109 --> 02:53:33.669]  Let's continue.
[02:53:35.531 --> 02:53:39.815]  Hope is the active conviction that despair will not have the last word.
[02:53:40.795 --> 02:53:43.478]  Despite much promise... Hey, pause again.
[02:53:43.798 --> 02:53:45.119]  I'm Danny Glover.
[02:53:45.259 --> 02:53:49.963]  I've made $200 million in American media, and white people bought my tickets.
[02:53:50.784 --> 02:53:51.465]  And they're bad.
[02:53:52.405 --> 02:53:52.786]  And yes,
[02:53:55.071 --> 02:53:57.934]  Mad Maxine got tens of millions to her husband's bank.
[02:53:58.494 --> 02:53:59.775]  America sucks!
[02:54:00.596 --> 02:54:03.018]  Maxine's only got seven mansions.
[02:54:03.719 --> 02:54:04.820]  Let's hear from Danny Glover.
[02:54:06.321 --> 02:54:09.424]  Despite much progress over the centuries,
[02:54:11.189 --> 02:54:22.974]  This hearing is yet another important step in the long and heroic struggle of African-Americans to secure reparations... Of victimhood and BS and crap.
[02:54:22.994 --> 02:54:27.656]  ...enslavement and post-emancipation... Pause.
[02:54:27.716 --> 02:54:30.857]  Sold by his black ancestors.
[02:54:31.118 --> 02:54:33.058]  The Muslims have slaves right now.
[02:54:33.299 --> 02:54:34.019]  But he doesn't care.
[02:54:34.219 --> 02:54:35.680]  He'll probably join an Islamic group.
[02:54:37.240 --> 02:54:38.581]  Let's go back to Danny Glover.
[02:54:38.601 --> 02:54:38.881]  Here we go.
[02:54:42.951 --> 02:54:44.914]  But America had other principles in mind.
[02:54:45.775 --> 02:54:48.660]  And so for a century after the Civil War, black people... Hey, pause.
[02:54:48.740 --> 02:54:49.601]  This just makes me...
[02:54:50.626 --> 02:54:53.247]  Want to sell everything I got and get the hell out of here, man.
[02:54:53.347 --> 02:54:53.948]  And just go.
[02:54:53.968 --> 02:54:57.490]  Because if you go into the midst of a whole bunch of brown people, they won't get mad at you.
[02:54:57.510 --> 02:54:58.330]  They'll be glad you're there.
[02:54:58.710 --> 02:55:00.191]  But then you won't be blamed for whatever's going on.
[02:55:00.211 --> 02:55:02.052]  I just want to like, here, you just run it all.
[02:55:02.312 --> 02:55:03.313]  Let it all fall apart.
[02:55:03.353 --> 02:55:03.993]  It's my fault.
[02:55:04.393 --> 02:55:05.754]  I'll just get out of here, Danny.
[02:55:06.554 --> 02:55:07.295]  I'm so bad.
[02:55:07.595 --> 02:55:10.336]  So sick of your racist ass telling me how much I suck all day.
[02:55:10.356 --> 02:55:11.557]  Here, let's go back to it.
[02:55:12.773 --> 02:55:14.514]  America had other principles in mind.
[02:55:15.394 --> 02:55:18.136]  And so for a century after the Civil War, black people were civilized.
[02:55:18.156 --> 02:55:19.637]  Oh, America had more!
[02:55:19.657 --> 02:55:21.318]  It's other people that are dead!
[02:55:21.898 --> 02:55:23.739]  You wanna, you'd love a, I'm a baby!
[02:55:23.999 --> 02:55:25.700]  Somebody did something to me all day!
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:26.701]  Give me a break, man!
[02:55:26.921 --> 02:55:31.824]  Dude, I had over 50 racist black people physically attack me when I was growing up in Dallas.
[02:55:32.324 --> 02:55:33.925]  And I don't blame other black people for that now.
[02:55:34.005 --> 02:55:36.606]  You, no white person ever knocked you upside the head.
[02:55:36.626 --> 02:55:40.629]  No white person ever put you in the hospital, you little baby bitch!
[02:55:41.869 --> 02:55:42.529]  You racist!
[02:55:42.829 --> 02:55:43.949]  Go back to this dumbass!
[02:55:45.190 --> 02:55:46.930]  Lentless campaign of terror.
[02:55:47.690 --> 02:55:52.191]  A campaign that extended well into the lifetime of Majority Leader McConnell.
[02:55:52.451 --> 02:55:52.811]  Hey, pause!
[02:55:53.091 --> 02:55:55.592]  You mean the black knockout game killing all these white people?
[02:55:56.052 --> 02:55:58.112]  Or blacks trying to target white cops and kill them?
[02:55:58.392 --> 02:55:59.672]  Or target black cops and kill them?
[02:55:59.692 --> 02:56:01.073]  I mean, just give me a break, man!
[02:56:01.333 --> 02:56:03.113]  This is the real world, you baby!
[02:56:03.753 --> 02:56:05.374]  Stick a big-ass sucker in your mouth!
[02:56:05.914 --> 02:56:06.534]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:56:06.554 --> 02:56:07.354]  I'm gonna play more of this.
[02:56:09.295 --> 02:56:15.498]  And I'm gonna play some of the other highlights of other black folks that didn't play along with the game, and of course the other black folks tried to shut their ass up.
[02:56:16.998 --> 02:56:19.619]  And tell them, you shut your mouth, we're gonna get something free.
[02:56:19.859 --> 02:56:28.803]  You're not, let me tell you something, LBJ created the welfare system for you, and he said, they're getting too uppity, they got their own money, they got their own companies, they got their own banks.
[02:56:29.263 --> 02:56:34.105]  I'll have these n-words voting Democrat for a hundred years, once we break their family up, go read the damn letters.
[02:56:34.565 --> 02:56:35.826]  Louis Farrakhan's right about this.
[02:56:37.079 --> 02:56:39.160]  And I'm not for segregation.
[02:56:40.161 --> 02:56:48.285]  I'm simply saying that when my dad was a little kid, the black people had their own restaurants, their own cleaners, their own hotels, their own everything.
[02:56:48.606 --> 02:56:50.507]  That which did not kill them made them stronger.
[02:56:50.867 --> 02:56:56.030]  The segregation and the discrimination and the oppression that was bad made them stronger.
[02:56:56.450 --> 02:57:05.095]  They were all into lower illegitimacy than white people, saving money, being strong, and that pissed off the KKK and LBJ.
[02:57:07.799 --> 02:57:08.780]  And they got your ass.
[02:57:09.200 --> 02:57:09.880]  And they're getting our ass.
[02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:11.041]  They're getting everybody's ass right now.
[02:57:11.601 --> 02:57:12.982]  With dependency.
[02:57:13.642 --> 02:57:18.285]  And now they got a big, fat, juicy promise for you of reparations.
[02:57:18.725 --> 02:57:25.530]  Don't you bet when you get that money, it's like $5,000 with a bunch of strings attached, with a big chain you put around your neck.
[02:57:26.810 --> 02:57:27.391]  Not me.
[02:57:27.791 --> 02:57:28.271]  Not me.
[02:57:29.012 --> 02:57:29.592]  I see through it.
[02:57:30.112 --> 02:57:32.794]  It's a load of horse manure.
[02:57:34.659 --> 02:57:39.342]  Please, listeners, we've got to break through this slavery of the globalist mindset, and only funding can do it.
[02:57:39.623 --> 02:57:40.804]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:57:41.104 --> 02:57:41.924]  Biggest sale ever.
[02:57:42.024 --> 02:57:42.845]  Save InfoWars.
[02:57:43.466 --> 02:57:44.066]  50% off.
[02:57:44.146 --> 02:57:45.127]  Double Patriot points.
[02:57:45.447 --> 02:57:46.768]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:47.008 --> 02:57:48.609]  The sales gotta end early next week.
[02:57:48.970 --> 02:57:50.911]  Please finance our revolution.
[02:57:54.977 --> 02:57:58.920]  Facebook and Instagram banned conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:57:59.200 --> 02:58:00.361]  I am now completely banned.
[02:58:00.401 --> 02:58:04.404]  Now, InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[02:58:04.684 --> 02:58:05.745]  I want them shut down.
[02:58:05.785 --> 02:58:06.706]  I want them silenced.
[02:58:06.746 --> 02:58:07.446]  I want them muted.
[02:58:07.466 --> 02:58:09.408]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:58:09.468 --> 02:58:10.969]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:17.174]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[02:58:17.274 --> 02:58:24.199]  These are very extreme individuals, and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them.
[02:58:24.279 --> 02:58:28.022]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous, is what Facebook is saying.
[02:58:28.323 --> 02:58:31.385]  Those individuals include people like right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:58:31.625 --> 02:58:33.826]  If you don't like someone on Facebook, don't follow them.
[02:58:33.947 --> 02:58:36.228]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[02:58:53.118 --> 02:58:57.460]  No, because Big Tech is only interested in going after conservatives.
[02:58:57.480 --> 02:58:58.800]  You know, the really dangerous ones.
[02:58:58.840 --> 02:59:02.002]  Dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[02:59:02.122 --> 02:59:07.164]  President Trump retweeted Paul Joseph Watson twice and a brief video by InfoWars' Millie Weaver.
[02:59:07.204 --> 02:59:11.266]  Social media's hall monitor, Brad Stelter, was not very happy about it.
[02:59:11.306 --> 02:59:14.487]  He is promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars.
[02:59:14.667 --> 02:59:24.092]  Back to your point, though, about the InfoWars presidency, I want to know, and I tweeted this the other day, what is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[02:59:24.472 --> 02:59:26.674]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[02:59:27.234 --> 02:59:29.515]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[02:59:29.815 --> 02:59:30.836]  I want them shut down.
[02:59:30.896 --> 02:59:31.816]  I want them silenced.
[02:59:31.877 --> 02:59:32.657]  I want them muted.
[02:59:32.697 --> 02:59:34.538]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:59:34.638 --> 02:59:35.999]  I want them shut down!
[02:59:36.019 --> 02:59:37.540]  I want them silenced!
[02:59:37.560 --> 02:59:38.360]  I want them muted!
[02:59:38.960 --> 02:59:39.521]  Don't worry.
[02:59:40.081 --> 02:59:41.802]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[02:59:46.713 --> 02:59:50.476]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:59:54.779 --> 03:00:00.744]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:09.651 --> 03:00:10.772]  I'm up here in space.
[03:00:12.233 --> 03:00:13.154]  I'm looking down on you.
[03:00:14.181 --> 03:00:19.122]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.902 --> 03:00:23.603]  I'm up here in space.
[03:00:25.004 --> 03:00:26.204]  I'm up here in space.
[03:00:26.644 --> 03:00:27.704]  I'm looking down on you.
[03:00:27.724 --> 03:00:30.045]  I'm looking down on you.
[03:00:30.105 --> 03:00:30.865]  My laser's trained.
[03:00:30.885 --> 03:00:32.345]  My laser's trained.
[03:00:32.445 --> 03:00:33.446]  Everything you do.
[03:00:34.826 --> 03:00:38.527]  You think you private lives think nothing of the kind.
[03:00:39.527 --> 03:00:43.168]  There is no true escape, I'm watching all the time.
[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:46.400]  I'm elemental!
[03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:48.361]  My sight is clean!
[03:00:49.701 --> 03:00:51.581]  I am perpetual!
[03:00:51.601 --> 03:00:53.362]  I keep the country free!
[03:01:04.004 --> 03:01:05.004]  Always in focus.
[03:01:10.905 --> 03:01:11.805]  You don't know I'm there.
[03:01:14.702 --> 03:01:16.863]  You know what a biological system's looking at, don't you?
[03:01:16.883 --> 03:01:23.128]  You don't know what the electric eye's looking at.
[03:01:23.148 --> 03:01:24.068]  I'm elemental!
[03:01:28.371 --> 03:01:29.792]  I am perpetual!
[03:01:29.832 --> 03:01:33.414]  Alright, let's get serious.
[03:01:35.375 --> 03:01:38.898]  The Washington Post is reporting that Senator Ted Cruz has attacked me.
[03:01:40.640 --> 03:01:41.480]  But did he really?
[03:01:42.061 --> 03:01:43.021]  Next segment will air it.
[03:01:43.121 --> 03:01:45.562]  And then, The Blaze came to my defense.
[03:01:48.263 --> 03:01:49.904]  Owen Benjamin came to my defense.
[03:01:51.885 --> 03:02:02.769]  Rick Wiles of True News, who's had a heart on for me for years for why I don't know, had to come to my begrudging defense on the fake child porn setup.
[03:02:03.933 --> 03:02:11.817]  But they all go, God, we hate defending him, and then string together a bunch of half-truths and 10% truths and non-truths.
[03:02:12.337 --> 03:02:14.578]  So I'll tell Rick Wiles this, because I watch his show.
[03:02:14.658 --> 03:02:15.919]  It's pretty informative.
[03:02:16.219 --> 03:02:17.320]  A lot of it, a lot of it was wrong.
[03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:24.584]  He said, I better get right with God and get my soul right, and then I am disturbed, and then I should get out of the spotlight.
[03:02:25.964 --> 03:02:27.325]  I agree with it all, but get out of the spotlight.
[03:02:27.425 --> 03:02:28.125]  You're right, Rick.
[03:02:28.345 --> 03:02:29.026]  I'm disturbed.
[03:02:30.205 --> 03:02:33.326]  I'm disturbed by babies being killed after they're born now.
[03:02:33.726 --> 03:02:37.446]  I'm disturbed by gay pride parades openly saying they're having sex with children.
[03:02:37.466 --> 03:02:39.267]  I have mainstream articles I haven't even gotten to.
[03:02:39.747 --> 03:02:41.647]  I am upset, Rick.
[03:02:42.287 --> 03:02:42.947]  I'm pissed.
[03:02:43.307 --> 03:02:44.268]  I'm raising the alarm.
[03:02:44.508 --> 03:02:46.228]  And sometimes I boil over.
[03:02:46.428 --> 03:02:47.408]  You're absolutely right, Rick.
[03:02:48.088 --> 03:02:48.528]  But you know what?
[03:02:48.548 --> 03:02:49.129]  I love God.
[03:02:49.249 --> 03:02:50.089]  I love Jesus Christ.
[03:02:50.269 --> 03:02:55.290]  And I pray for God to cool me off like a race car that has, you know, 1,500 horsepower.
[03:03:01.809 --> 03:03:03.170]  I got a little too much juice.
[03:03:03.190 --> 03:03:04.410]  I understand.
[03:03:05.070 --> 03:03:05.371]  Believe me.
[03:03:06.051 --> 03:03:12.554]  But my life and my goals and my soul is pointed at justice and at Jesus Christ.
[03:03:13.974 --> 03:03:15.915]  And so, I'm not pissed at black people.
[03:03:16.576 --> 03:03:25.119]  I'm pissed at how they've been slaves for so long in this country and how the very same people that did it to the Democrats are offering them some new freebie that's gonna supposedly free them.
[03:03:25.660 --> 03:03:30.522]  Let's go to this clip of this former NFL player who they boo and try to shut down when he talks.
[03:03:32.602 --> 03:03:36.745]  Burgess Owens, when he says the Democrats should be paying the reparations, here it is.
[03:03:36.805 --> 03:03:38.986]  Do you not believe in reparation?
[03:03:39.906 --> 03:03:52.974]  Because what reparation does, it points to a certain race, a certain color, and it points them as evil, and points the other race, my race, as one that has not only become racist, but also beggars.
[03:03:53.655 --> 03:03:55.356]  I do believe in restitution.
[03:03:56.176 --> 03:04:00.619]  Let's point to the party that was part of slavery, KKK, Jim Crow.
[03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:04.281]  And it's killed over 40% of our black babies.
[03:04:04.301 --> 03:04:05.482]  20 million of them.
[03:04:06.042 --> 03:04:06.482]  That's right.
[03:04:07.523 --> 03:04:07.943]  That's right.
[03:04:08.103 --> 03:04:12.665]  State of California, 75% of our black boys cannot pass standard reading and writing test.
[03:04:13.025 --> 03:04:14.205]  A democratic state.
[03:04:14.365 --> 03:04:15.266]  That's on by design.
[03:04:15.286 --> 03:04:17.527]  So yes, let's pay restoration.
[03:04:18.347 --> 03:04:20.868]  Let's pay restitution.
[03:04:21.869 --> 03:04:24.370]  How about a democratic party pay for all the misery brought to my race?
[03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:31.258]  And those, after we learn our history, decide... Please get him on the show.
[03:04:31.478 --> 03:04:32.219]  They should pay also.
[03:04:32.239 --> 03:04:32.860]  They're complicit.
[03:04:33.401 --> 03:04:39.592]  And every white American, Republican or Democrat, that feels guilty because of your white skin, you should need to pony up also.
[03:04:41.237 --> 03:04:44.818]  That way we get past this reparation and recognize that this country has given us greatness.
[03:04:45.218 --> 03:04:46.019]  Look at my panel.
[03:04:46.159 --> 03:04:47.359]  Doesn't matter how we think.
[03:04:47.379 --> 03:04:49.340]  The fact is, it doesn't matter our color.
[03:04:50.180 --> 03:04:54.782]  We have become successful in this country like no other because of this great opportunity.
[03:04:54.842 --> 03:04:55.162]  Hit pause.
[03:04:55.182 --> 03:04:56.062]  I want to come back with him again.
[03:04:56.082 --> 03:04:58.143]  He gets the soil, the sun.
[03:04:58.183 --> 03:04:59.083]  We grew together.
[03:04:59.744 --> 03:05:00.724]  But they want to poison that.
[03:05:18.721 --> 03:05:22.882]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:05:38.045 --> 03:05:39.225]  Yo, bro, what's up?
[03:05:39.265 --> 03:05:40.085]  Let's get down!
[03:05:40.205 --> 03:05:42.626]  You think you're f***ing tough?
[03:05:42.646 --> 03:05:43.326]  You're about to get it!
[03:05:43.466 --> 03:05:44.506]  I will break your jaw.
[03:05:44.566 --> 03:05:45.647]  I will knock your teeth out.
[03:05:45.787 --> 03:05:46.707]  I will break your nose.
[03:05:46.747 --> 03:05:47.667]  I will break your neck.
[03:05:48.206 --> 03:05:49.067]  I'm not afraid of you people!
[03:05:49.667 --> 03:05:50.788]  You're a little wimp!
[03:05:51.189 --> 03:05:52.790]  You son of a piece of garbage!
[03:05:53.411 --> 03:05:54.091]  I hate you!
[03:05:54.311 --> 03:05:55.312]  My listeners hate you!
[03:05:55.452 --> 03:05:57.174]  And remember that scumbag forever!
[03:05:57.814 --> 03:06:00.036]  If you don't spread the links, the globalists win!
[03:06:00.236 --> 03:06:01.097]  Spread the links!
[03:06:15.732 --> 03:06:26.819]  You found it.
[03:06:27.659 --> 03:06:28.540]  The tip of the spear.
[03:06:29.860 --> 03:06:32.562]  The anti-globalist operation.
[03:06:34.183 --> 03:06:36.364]  I'm going to find me.
[03:06:36.384 --> 03:06:40.427]  I'm going to find me a reckless woman.
[03:06:40.927 --> 03:06:42.248]  With razor blades.
[03:06:44.325 --> 03:06:49.768]  And just a touch of sadness in her fingers.
[03:06:49.908 --> 03:06:52.770]  And thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[03:07:11.594 --> 03:07:15.037]  With the woman and the stallion in the wind.
[03:07:40.571 --> 03:07:52.177]  Alright, so let's finish up with a former NFL player who destroys the lives of the Democratic Party, the KKK, who want to continue to divide this country with fake reparations that will destroy the rule of law.
[03:07:53.577 --> 03:07:55.278]  Burgess Owens destroys them.
[03:07:56.099 --> 03:08:01.941]  And then, we see the headline, now the Washington Post is inaccurate, that I've been attacked by Ted Cruz.
[03:08:01.961 --> 03:08:03.022]  We'll play that video in a moment.
[03:08:03.582 --> 03:08:07.164]  But here is this interesting point from the hearings yesterday.
[03:08:07.184 --> 03:08:09.185]  I do not believe in reparation.
[03:08:10.165 --> 03:08:11.125]  That's what reparation does.
[03:08:11.165 --> 03:08:23.171]  It points to a certain race, a certain color, and it points them as evil, and points the other race, my race, as one that has not only become racist, but also beggars.
[03:08:23.851 --> 03:08:25.552]  I do believe in restitution.
[03:08:26.372 --> 03:08:35.656]  Let's point to the party that was part of slavery, KKK, Jim Crow, that has killed over 40% of our black babies, 20 million of them.
[03:08:38.294 --> 03:08:42.879]  State of California, 75% of our black boys cannot pass standard reading and writing tests.
[03:08:43.219 --> 03:08:44.421]  A democratic state.
[03:08:45.482 --> 03:08:47.724]  So yes, let's pay restoration.
[03:08:48.565 --> 03:08:51.068]  Let's pay restitution.
[03:08:52.069 --> 03:08:53.150]  How about a democratic party?
[03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:54.592]  Pay for all the misery brought to my race.
[03:08:56.915 --> 03:09:02.419]  And those, after we learn our history, decide to stay there, they should pay also.
[03:09:02.439 --> 03:09:03.060]  They're complicit.
[03:09:03.600 --> 03:09:09.825]  And every white American, Republican or Democrat, that feels guilty because of your white skin, you should need to pony up also.
[03:09:11.446 --> 03:09:15.028]  That way we get past this reparation and recognize that this country has given us greatness.
[03:09:15.429 --> 03:09:16.189]  Look at this panel.
[03:09:16.209 --> 03:09:17.610]  It doesn't matter how we think.
[03:09:17.790 --> 03:09:19.552]  The fact is, it doesn't matter our color.
[03:09:20.392 --> 03:09:25.016]  We have become successful in this country like no other because of this great opportunity
[03:09:26.069 --> 03:09:27.090]  To live the American Dream.
[03:09:27.570 --> 03:09:29.772]  Let's not steal that from our kids by telling them they can't do it.
[03:09:30.772 --> 03:09:31.253]  That's right.
[03:09:31.653 --> 03:09:32.954]  And again, that's why they're so scared.
[03:09:32.994 --> 03:09:35.635]  America isn't perfect, but we were reaching to try to fix it all.
[03:09:35.996 --> 03:09:40.859]  So how are we the best, when it comes to freedoms and things, gonna say we're the worst now?
[03:09:41.339 --> 03:09:45.662]  When you go to any other country, they're all about, you go to China, you're white, you're black, they're like, get out of here.
[03:09:45.702 --> 03:09:49.705]  You go to places like Africa, you're not the right tribe, no matter if you're black, they'll kill your ass.
[03:09:50.105 --> 03:09:55.329]  So why are we putting America down and all the great things we've got, when it's the best shot we've got?
[03:09:56.957 --> 03:10:00.840]  Now Coleman Hughes is a columnist, got torn up as well and booed.
[03:10:00.860 --> 03:10:03.721]  They tried to shut him down when he said similar things.
[03:10:03.741 --> 03:10:04.182]  Here it is.
[03:10:05.382 --> 03:10:11.947]  Nothing I'm about to say is meant to minimize the horror and brutality of slavery and Jim Crow.
[03:10:13.307 --> 03:10:15.889]  Racism is a bloody stain on this country's history.
[03:10:15.909 --> 03:10:16.450]  Hit pause though.
[03:10:17.714 --> 03:10:21.035]  Notice because he says that, that's why they attack him.
[03:10:21.055 --> 03:10:24.336]  Like he's saying, we're wrong, or I'm admitting.
[03:10:24.836 --> 03:10:26.436]  The other guy just said, this is a bunch of BS.
[03:10:26.716 --> 03:10:28.077]  Democrats are the slave runners.
[03:10:28.457 --> 03:10:28.977]  Blah, blah, blah.
[03:10:29.037 --> 03:10:29.737]  It's a bunch of crap.
[03:10:30.177 --> 03:10:33.338]  But this guy wants to make everybody feel good, bring them together.
[03:10:33.738 --> 03:10:35.418]  He's saying, hey, things haven't been perfect here.
[03:10:35.818 --> 03:10:36.879]  That's when they see weakness.
[03:10:37.199 --> 03:10:40.059]  Because I used to have people say, oh, say you're sorry for questioning this or that.
[03:10:40.099 --> 03:10:41.240]  And I go, OK, I'm sorry.
[03:10:41.480 --> 03:10:43.000]  Oh my God, you admit you lied.
[03:10:43.040 --> 03:10:43.460]  It's over.
[03:10:43.660 --> 03:10:44.701]  I'm not putting this guy down.
[03:10:44.721 --> 03:10:46.281]  I've been through this.
[03:10:48.831 --> 03:10:52.494]  Where you try to say, okay, I'm not perfect, they just use it against you.
[03:10:52.534 --> 03:10:52.854]  Here it is.
[03:10:53.515 --> 03:11:02.242]  Failure to pay reparations directly to freed slaves after the Civil War, to be one of the greatest injustices ever perpetrated by the U.S.
[03:11:02.262 --> 03:11:02.622]  government.
[03:11:04.103 --> 03:11:09.548]  But I worry that our desire to fix the past compromises our ability to fix the present.
[03:11:10.609 --> 03:11:11.790]  Think about what we're doing today.
[03:11:12.892 --> 03:11:25.359]  We're spending our time debating a bill that mentions slavery 25 times, but incarceration only once, in an era with no black slaves, but nearly a million black prisoners.
[03:11:26.379 --> 03:11:35.624]  A bill that doesn't mention homicide once, at a time when the Center for Disease Control reports homicide as the number one cause of death for young black men.
[03:11:36.785 --> 03:11:39.426]  I'm not saying that acknowledging history doesn't matter.
[03:11:39.866 --> 03:11:40.227]  It does.
[03:11:41.348 --> 03:11:48.154]  I'm saying there's a difference between acknowledging history and allowing history to distract us from the problems we face today.
[03:11:49.875 --> 03:11:55.480]  In 2008, the House of Representatives formally apologized for slavery and Jim Crow.
[03:11:56.020 --> 03:11:57.441]  In 2009, the Senate did the same.
[03:11:58.642 --> 03:12:01.084]  Black people don't need another apology.
[03:12:01.945 --> 03:12:04.727]  We need safer neighborhoods and better schools.
[03:12:05.708 --> 03:12:08.310]  We need a less punitive criminal justice system.
[03:12:09.144 --> 03:12:10.584]  We need affordable health care.
[03:12:11.385 --> 03:12:15.425]  And none of these things can be achieved through reparations for slavery.
[03:12:18.646 --> 03:12:23.767]  Nearly everyone close to me told me not to testify today.
[03:12:24.267 --> 03:12:31.189]  They told me that even though I've only ever voted for Democrats, I'd be perceived as a Republican and therefore hated by half the country.
[03:12:32.105 --> 03:12:37.910]  Others told me that by distancing myself from Republicans, I would end up angering the other half of the country.
[03:12:38.751 --> 03:12:41.093]  And the sad truth is that they were both right.
[03:12:41.914 --> 03:12:44.837]  That's how suspicious we've become of one another.
[03:12:45.537 --> 03:12:48.280]  That's how divided we are as a nation.
[03:12:50.325 --> 03:13:01.313]  If we were to pay reparations today, we would only divide the country further, making it harder to build the political coalitions required to solve the problems facing black people today.
[03:13:02.374 --> 03:13:07.817]  We would insult many black Americans by putting a price on the suffering of their ancestors.
[03:13:07.857 --> 03:13:08.338]  Exactly.
[03:13:09.098 --> 03:13:15.303]  And we would turn the relationship between black Americans and white Americans from a coalition into a transaction.
[03:13:15.771 --> 03:13:17.753]  Oh, and this will turn people into total racists.
[03:13:18.174 --> 03:13:20.937]  ...into a lawsuit between plaintiffs and defendants.
[03:13:22.459 --> 03:13:31.610]  What we should do is pay reparations to black Americans who actually grew up under Jim Crow and were directly harmed by second class citizenship.
[03:13:32.010 --> 03:13:33.172]  People like my grandparents.
[03:13:34.329 --> 03:13:37.873]  But paying reparations to all descendants of slaves is a mistake.
[03:13:38.593 --> 03:13:39.714]  Take me, for example.
[03:13:40.495 --> 03:13:46.601]  I was born three decades after the end of Jim Crow into a privileged household in the suburbs.
[03:13:47.532 --> 03:13:54.698]  I attend an Ivy League school, yet I'm also descended from slaves who worked on Thomas Jefferson's Monticello plantation.
[03:13:55.679 --> 03:14:08.871]  So reparations for slavery would allocate federal resources to me, but not to an American with the wrong ancestry, even if that person is living paycheck to paycheck and working multiple jobs to support a family.
[03:14:08.891 --> 03:14:10.572]  It's incredibly discriminatory, exactly.
[03:14:10.772 --> 03:14:11.893]  You might call that justice.
[03:14:12.714 --> 03:14:17.256]  I call it justice for the dead at the price of justice for the living.
[03:14:18.697 --> 03:14:23.779]  I understand that reparations are about what people are owed, regardless of how well they're doing.
[03:14:24.179 --> 03:14:24.920]  I understand that.
[03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:26.481]  Hit pause.
[03:14:26.861 --> 03:14:27.441]  We gotta go to break.
[03:14:27.461 --> 03:14:39.887]  This guy's really smart, but I mean just... The asinine-ness that if somebody else did something 160 years ago that you're guilty unless you stole a painting
[03:14:41.049 --> 03:14:42.270]  Because this happened in the Holocaust.
[03:14:42.850 --> 03:14:43.650]  Like Madeleine Albright.
[03:14:43.670 --> 03:14:46.311]  She's Jewish, but her dad broke her Jews trying to get out.
[03:14:46.331 --> 03:14:47.012]  They didn't have the money.
[03:14:47.052 --> 03:14:47.492]  He'd kill them.
[03:14:47.512 --> 03:14:49.193]  There's a lot of Jews helped run the Holocaust.
[03:14:49.213 --> 03:14:50.073]  That's been declassified.
[03:14:50.093 --> 03:14:51.153]  It's a terrible thing.
[03:14:52.054 --> 03:14:54.695]  And she had a lot of Holocaust paintings worth tens of millions in her house.
[03:14:54.735 --> 03:14:58.997]  And she'd do interviews on TV, and people saw famous paintings in her house.
[03:14:59.637 --> 03:15:01.678]  And people were like, hey, my grandmother painted that.
[03:15:01.978 --> 03:15:02.459]  That painting.
[03:15:02.519 --> 03:15:04.940]  And they're like, well, yeah, my dad took it from her.
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:06.160]  Screw you.
[03:15:06.220 --> 03:15:06.961]  I'm murdering you.
[03:15:07.201 --> 03:15:07.921]  I'm Madeleine Albright.
[03:15:08.261 --> 03:15:09.502]  I murder people!
[03:15:10.502 --> 03:15:14.204]  I brag about 500,000 dead Iraqi children and say it's a good price.
[03:15:14.584 --> 03:15:15.845]  I take your property!
[03:15:16.165 --> 03:15:17.525]  I'm a giant toad goblin!
[03:15:18.025 --> 03:15:19.006]  I rob Jews!
[03:15:19.186 --> 03:15:20.166]  I'm like George Soros!
[03:15:20.567 --> 03:15:21.867]  I'm a super goblin!
[03:15:24.628 --> 03:15:31.011]  But it came out that she had stolen Jewish art from murdered Jews that her father murdered!
[03:15:33.392 --> 03:15:34.413]  She's an alpha god!
[03:15:35.073 --> 03:15:35.754]  She kills you!
[03:15:36.014 --> 03:15:36.574]  She takes it!
[03:15:38.666 --> 03:15:42.108]  Now you could say reparations to that person's family because she stole the painting.
[03:15:42.348 --> 03:15:45.050]  There's a direct piece of property and a direct pig goblin.
[03:15:46.250 --> 03:15:47.971]  But people ten generations ago?
[03:15:47.991 --> 03:15:49.492]  You don't even know who it is?
[03:15:49.832 --> 03:15:51.213]  I'm gonna pay some money for you?
[03:15:51.653 --> 03:15:53.755]  You better get your ass straight on that!
[03:15:54.035 --> 03:15:55.155]  That's called fraud!
[03:15:55.416 --> 03:15:56.416]  That's called slavery!
[03:15:56.656 --> 03:15:57.957]  And I'm nobody's slave!
[03:15:58.417 --> 03:15:59.138]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:08.806 --> 03:16:12.550]  Getting into the inside baseball, we've been telling people Trump's about to go on the offense.
[03:16:12.750 --> 03:16:18.896]  You were getting into the fact that the last straw really was Facebook banning certain names in certain terms.
[03:16:18.936 --> 03:16:22.699]  That really pushed Trump over the edge and now Human Events is riding on it.
[03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:25.222]  It's now being confirmed by Bloomberg.
[03:16:25.242 --> 03:16:26.002]  You want to talk about this?
[03:16:26.022 --> 03:16:29.726]  This is pretty big to show Trump's thinking, just to show how real he is.
[03:16:30.066 --> 03:16:30.406]  Exactly.
[03:16:30.466 --> 03:16:49.617]  In other words, had they simply not made the choice to ban your name from their platform, and had not made the choice to try to go after and censor people saying anything positive about Alex Jones or Info, it would not have led to the antitrust investigation, and just the announcement of the investigation, and the possibility it was going to go into Facebook as well,
[03:16:50.077 --> 03:16:53.039]  Cost them $137 billion.
[03:16:53.600 --> 03:16:57.603]  That's how much money was lost by Big Tech by choosing to go after you.
[03:16:57.743 --> 03:17:03.066]  That's how much the president cost them just by announcing the possibility of an investigation.
[03:17:03.167 --> 03:17:14.635]  $137 billion collectively lost across Big Tech in less than a day solely because they decided to come after you, not recognizing that the president was going to stand by his audience.
[03:17:14.875 --> 03:17:21.059]  He was going to stand by his people and was going to stand by the original principles of free speech and free press that govern and guide this country.
[03:17:21.099 --> 03:17:23.741]  I mean, all they had to do is hear the president meets with Jack at Twitter.
[03:17:24.122 --> 03:17:28.545]  There's all these problems that had already been documented by that point, saying, look, just pull back.
[03:17:28.865 --> 03:17:29.786]  Don't meddle in the election.
[03:17:30.026 --> 03:17:31.727]  Don't continue to suppress and censor speech.
[03:17:32.087 --> 03:17:34.929]  And they would have been able to save their stockholders over $100 billion.
[03:17:35.249 --> 03:17:35.830]  But they refused.
[03:17:36.130 --> 03:17:40.453]  They decided they're going to go after- Oh, they're now spinning it because we cut off the fake news and we lost money.
[03:17:40.973 --> 03:17:44.456]  No, it's because you're censoring and antitrust investigations have been opened up on you.
[03:17:44.656 --> 03:17:45.136]  Precisely.
[03:17:45.397 --> 03:17:49.379]  There would be no antitrust investigation if they weren't engaged in any antitrust illicit activity.
[03:17:49.699 --> 03:18:07.932]  When they decided to go from just being a technological monopoly on a platform and instead be a technological monopoly on speech, on press, and on elections, they made a decision that was a fateful decision that has now cost them billions of dollars, will cost them billions of dollars more in the future, and now they're under major antitrust investigation, and it's not gonna stop at Google.
[03:18:08.052 --> 03:18:08.932]  It's gonna keep going.
[03:18:09.352 --> 03:18:14.616]  All of these big social media tech giants might be taken apart, might be wiped off the map.
[03:18:14.616 --> 03:18:24.520]  Yeah, might be basically forced to dissolve and forced to separate out its assets in the same way that Rockefeller was with Standard Oil back at the turn of the century.
[03:18:24.900 --> 03:18:26.941]  So I think what's happening is there's now the U.S.
[03:18:26.961 --> 03:18:32.423]  Federal Trade Commission has now announced that Facebook has agreed to subject itself to an antitrust investigation.
[03:18:32.884 --> 03:18:36.805]  The Google antitrust investigation was leaked on Friday.
[03:18:37.406 --> 03:18:43.068]  There's talk that it will go further than Facebook and Google and they're looking at Twitter, they're looking at Netflix, they're looking at other operators.
[03:18:43.508 --> 03:19:04.598]  So these operators that decided to be so overtly political over the last two years, that they were going to use their tech monopoly, their platform monopoly, to suppress, censor speech, to shame individuals, to leak private information against them, to use and leverage their power to help the Democrats take the House, to help the Democrat win the Senate in 2017, threatening to do so the same in 2020.
[03:19:05.538 --> 03:19:09.220]  When they reach the point where not only they ban people from using your name and InfoWars name,
[03:19:09.560 --> 03:19:17.026]  And at the same time, banned Paul Joseph Watson from all Facebook and Instagram overnight.
[03:19:17.086 --> 03:19:19.669]  They agreed he hadn't violated any rule ever.
[03:19:19.689 --> 03:19:23.011]  It was such a shock that it's what put the president in motion.
[03:19:23.031 --> 03:19:26.955]  He realized, okay, this is too severe, so severe, action needs to be taken.
[03:19:27.235 --> 03:19:32.920]  Let's unleash the kraken of antitrust enforcement against these rogue operators.
[03:19:33.120 --> 03:19:40.643]  Who think now they get to control and govern the country and get to impose a Chinese social credit model system on the United States democracy and speech systems.
[03:20:06.385 --> 03:20:09.127]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.511 --> 03:20:18.955]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[03:20:20.496 --> 03:20:24.099]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[03:20:25.220 --> 03:20:30.024]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow-eyed.
[03:20:30.776 --> 03:20:35.160]  He said, it's a long walk to Nashville, would you like to ride?
[03:20:35.520 --> 03:20:37.682]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:38.202 --> 03:20:42.987]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:20:43.007 --> 03:20:44.688]  I sat down in the front seat.
[03:20:45.389 --> 03:20:47.250]  He turned on the radio.
[03:20:48.011 --> 03:20:52.795]  And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers was solid country gold.
[03:20:53.796 --> 03:20:58.220]  Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale when he asked me for a light.
[03:20:59.264 --> 03:20:59.705]  Wait a minute.
[03:20:59.725 --> 03:21:00.426]  That's not George Strait.
[03:21:00.466 --> 03:21:00.886]  Who is that?
[03:21:13.676 --> 03:21:15.977]  Can you bend them guitar strings?
[03:21:17.998 --> 03:21:29.285]  It's kind of your country version of it's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll.
[03:21:29.305 --> 03:21:30.986]  All right, let's get serious.
[03:21:32.046 --> 03:21:37.970]  I literally, a couple times a day, punch in Alex Jones on YouTube to see the latest incredible stuff, good, bad, ugly, going on.
[03:21:38.430 --> 03:21:39.631]  And I punched it in earlier.
[03:21:41.385 --> 03:21:50.994]  And the headline came up in the Washington Post video feed that Senator Ted Cruz says we should stand up to voices like Alex Jones, not silence them.
[03:21:51.854 --> 03:21:54.177]  Now, I never said Ted Cruz's dad killed Kennedy.
[03:21:54.837 --> 03:21:58.701]  I said the word was he was in the CIA out of Cuba, was an anti-communist.
[03:21:58.741 --> 03:21:59.882]  That's a good thing, Ted!
[03:22:01.431 --> 03:22:03.913]  The media ran with that, and you dropped out of the race a day later.
[03:22:03.933 --> 03:22:05.374]  Because the word is, it's true.
[03:22:05.454 --> 03:22:09.237]  Your dad was in the CIA out of Cuba, then sent to Canada, and we all know that.
[03:22:09.838 --> 03:22:10.779]  And he was an anti-communist.
[03:22:10.799 --> 03:22:11.319]  That's a good thing.
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:13.961]  And I supported Ted Cruz over Beto.
[03:22:14.542 --> 03:22:14.922]  Obviously.
[03:22:14.942 --> 03:22:16.143]  I think Ted's a great guy overall.
[03:22:17.504 --> 03:22:19.966]  But, and I ran into him in D.C., and we had a nice talk.
[03:22:20.567 --> 03:22:26.231]  But here's the Washington Post, Jeff Bezos' operation, trying to get him to throw me under the bus.
[03:22:26.591 --> 03:22:26.952]  Here it is.
[03:22:28.393 --> 03:22:34.257]  To your point about fraud and knowing things are falsehoods and taking them down, how then do you address something like Alex Jones?
[03:22:34.778 --> 03:22:41.403]  This is somebody who very publicly was posting conspiracy theories about quite a good number of things, including the shooting at Sandy Hook.
[03:22:41.903 --> 03:22:46.686]  At times it appeared like you had been defending his ability to say that, so let's just start with the basics.
[03:22:46.706 --> 03:22:47.867]  What are your thoughts on Alex Jones?
[03:22:47.907 --> 03:22:50.169]  Should he have been able to continue to do these things all night?
[03:22:50.549 --> 03:22:54.012]  I think, listen, I think Alex Jones is a nut.
[03:22:55.069 --> 03:22:56.050]  I don't listen to the guy.
[03:22:56.070 --> 03:22:57.330]  I don't know what he has to say.
[03:22:59.431 --> 03:23:05.174]  But I also don't like that a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires suddenly decided this voice shall be silenced.
[03:23:05.934 --> 03:23:10.697]  We the Star Chamber have spoken and his listeners have no right to hear him.
[03:23:10.737 --> 03:23:16.580]  Now, part of the reason I spoke out in support of Alex Jones is because he's been a son of a bitch to me.
[03:23:17.700 --> 03:23:22.823]  The guy goes on air and routinely accuses my father of killing John F. Kennedy.
[03:23:24.761 --> 03:23:27.703]  For the record, he didn't do it, but my dad did take out Jimmy Hoffa.
[03:23:27.763 --> 03:23:28.724]  I apologize for that.
[03:23:31.586 --> 03:23:36.410]  Look, to be honest, I don't like crackpots that accuse my father of murder.
[03:23:36.430 --> 03:23:37.271]  All right, let's hit pause.
[03:23:38.172 --> 03:23:44.116]  What's up with every interviewer either being a transvestite or like a weird little robot soy boy?
[03:23:45.057 --> 03:23:51.082]  Because they put out all these things I didn't say or didn't do, and then this person's supposed to renounce them.
[03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:55.611]  The New York Times promoted fake WMDs that killed millions.
[03:23:56.111 --> 03:23:57.591]  They run the whole Arab Spring.
[03:23:57.631 --> 03:23:59.612]  They do all this criminal stuff on purpose.
[03:23:59.912 --> 03:24:01.272]  They lie continually.
[03:24:02.312 --> 03:24:05.313]  And they go, oh, Alex Jones does all these bad things.
[03:24:07.254 --> 03:24:08.274]  I had Roger Stone on.
[03:24:09.554 --> 03:24:09.794]  Ted.
[03:24:10.875 --> 03:24:15.596]  And Roger Stone, at that time, Ted, was talking to the president and talking to
[03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:21.891]  CENTCOM, Special Operations Command, and the word is your dad was in the CIA.
[03:24:22.171 --> 03:24:24.871]  And we just brought that up, and you dropped it out of the race the next day.
[03:24:25.531 --> 03:24:28.112]  So, you're recycling all this.
[03:24:28.152 --> 03:24:30.993]  So, you should be mad at Trump if you're mad about that.
[03:24:31.013 --> 03:24:34.313]  Because we all know where it came from, and we know Trump repeated it.
[03:24:34.853 --> 03:24:36.594]  Oh, but you love him now, don't you?
[03:24:38.354 --> 03:24:39.714]  I did my job, buddy boy.
[03:24:40.134 --> 03:24:40.594]  And you know it.
[03:24:40.974 --> 03:24:43.355]  Like getting your ass into office here in Texas.
[03:24:45.481 --> 03:24:49.625]  Here he is sucking the lollipop of the Washington Post.
[03:24:49.645 --> 03:24:50.205]  Let's continue.
[03:24:51.166 --> 03:24:54.529]  Like crackpots that accused my father of murder.
[03:24:56.411 --> 03:24:59.194]  That's why I defended his First Amendment rights.
[03:25:00.526 --> 03:25:05.990]  Because the First Amendment is about letting people speak and letting the marketplace of ideas decide.
[03:25:06.030 --> 03:25:10.313]  It's precisely because I was defending someone who comes after me.
[03:25:11.514 --> 03:25:15.597]  To illustrate, this is not about my particular policy views being favored.
[03:25:15.617 --> 03:25:22.802]  This is about... And it used to be, by the way... The soy boy is in love.
[03:25:22.822 --> 03:25:23.743]  Can we back this up?
[03:25:23.763 --> 03:25:26.425]  In fact, do these guys get a hotel room later?
[03:25:26.465 --> 03:25:27.846]  Which is fine, I'm super liberal.
[03:25:28.942 --> 03:25:31.383]  But like, I think we know who's pitching and who's catching here.
[03:25:32.204 --> 03:25:35.885]  Did Ted Cruz have his legs up behind that guy's ears an hour later in a hotel room?
[03:25:36.586 --> 03:25:38.166]  And by the way, that's called comedy, folks.
[03:25:38.246 --> 03:25:39.387]  I'm not being serious here.
[03:25:39.507 --> 03:25:43.989]  But, I mean, Soy Boy looks like he stepped off a little flying saucer.
[03:25:44.789 --> 03:25:45.850]  Maybe it's a gray alien.
[03:25:45.870 --> 03:25:47.290]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[03:25:47.330 --> 03:25:48.091]  It's all called comedy.
[03:25:48.751 --> 03:25:54.514]  But seriously, Ted, Ted, you wouldn't have got elected if we didn't support you for the Senate again.
[03:25:55.359 --> 03:26:04.881]  And you go back to your vomit, you go back to these guys that would slit your throat in a minute, as if groveling to the Washington Post will make... We've already overthrown them.
[03:26:04.901 --> 03:26:05.982]  We've already defeated them.
[03:26:06.242 --> 03:26:15.544]  And we keep going through this Groundhog Day every time that some chicken-necked soy boy that no one even knows who he is, and then you're gonna just go into this prostration before him.
[03:26:15.784 --> 03:26:16.324]  Let's continue.
[03:26:18.332 --> 03:26:23.194]  And it used to be, by the way, journalists used to be vigorous in protecting free speech.
[03:26:23.234 --> 03:26:24.175]  It's really striking.
[03:26:24.295 --> 03:26:25.015]  That's a good point, now.
[03:26:25.435 --> 03:26:26.575]  How many journalists... Pause.
[03:26:26.595 --> 03:26:27.476]  Back this up five seconds.
[03:26:27.956 --> 03:26:30.677]  So he does his little, I'm not with Alex Jones.
[03:26:30.757 --> 03:26:31.897]  Now he tells you what he really thinks.
[03:26:32.017 --> 03:26:32.858]  I like Ted Cruz.
[03:26:34.418 --> 03:26:36.079]  We had a private conversation in D.C.
[03:26:37.580 --> 03:26:38.300]  Part of it on tape.
[03:26:38.440 --> 03:26:40.341]  The point is, I like Ted Cruz.
[03:26:40.361 --> 03:26:41.381]  He could be president someday.
[03:26:41.741 --> 03:26:42.761]  Knock it off, Ted.
[03:26:43.662 --> 03:26:44.722]  Your dad was in the CIA.
[03:26:44.942 --> 03:26:46.563]  You want us to release the documents?
[03:26:47.739 --> 03:26:49.099]  That doesn't mean he killed JFK.
[03:26:50.840 --> 03:26:52.000]  He was involved in New Orleans.
[03:26:54.321 --> 03:26:55.041]  Knock it off!
[03:26:56.662 --> 03:26:58.782]  We're here to protect and defend your ideas.
[03:26:58.842 --> 03:26:59.982]  We like what you do.
[03:27:00.843 --> 03:27:03.844]  So stop acting like this cocksucker next to you.
[03:27:04.004 --> 03:27:05.424]  I'm sorry, whatever he is, delay that.
[03:27:07.385 --> 03:27:11.086]  Stop acting like this little trendy next to you is your life raft.
[03:27:11.366 --> 03:27:12.066]  He ain't, man.
[03:27:12.306 --> 03:27:15.087]  He'll take you down like a ton of bricks tied to your ankles.
[03:27:15.307 --> 03:27:15.767]  Go back to him.
[03:27:18.502 --> 03:27:23.345]  And it used to be, by the way, journalists used to be vigorous in protecting free speech.
[03:27:23.385 --> 03:27:24.345]  It's really striking.
[03:27:25.606 --> 03:27:30.629]  How many journalists are perfectly fine with the massive power big tech has to censor views?
[03:27:30.649 --> 03:27:34.691]  And it may be because the views they're suppressing journalists disagree with.
[03:27:34.711 --> 03:27:40.474]  So if they're suppressing pro-life views, look, most journalists are not pro-life, so what skin is it off my nose?
[03:27:41.513 --> 03:27:52.522]  Well, I think that's a very dangerous power to hand over if you suddenly have two or three billionaires deciding what speech is allowed, what speech is not, and it's all invisible.
[03:27:52.759 --> 03:28:02.328]  But Senator, this was an example of somebody who has a very large following that had been enabled in some ways by the social media platforms that later banned him to spread those falsehoods.
[03:28:02.889 --> 03:28:06.552]  You don't think that those companies have a responsibility to sort of limit the spread of that, if they can?
[03:28:07.052 --> 03:28:14.479]  Well, look, I will note, by the way, because I guess as I understand it he has a radio show, he's facing slander and libel.
[03:28:15.200 --> 03:28:15.701]  Litigation.
[03:28:35.149 --> 03:28:40.232]  Never roll around in the mud with a pig, because you'll get covered in mud and the pig likes it.
[03:28:41.732 --> 03:28:43.533]  That, frankly, was my advice to my dad.
[03:28:43.633 --> 03:28:44.213]  Bingo!
[03:28:45.294 --> 03:28:47.715]  But, we do have a legal system.
[03:28:48.015 --> 03:28:51.157]  We launched the whole movement you wrote in on, you and Trump.
[03:28:51.477 --> 03:28:55.959]  My audience launched the whole wave you rolled in on, brother.
[03:28:56.780 --> 03:28:57.440]  Recognize it.
[03:28:57.660 --> 03:28:59.201]  We wrote the whole book.
[03:29:00.157 --> 03:29:00.657]  And I get it.
[03:29:00.837 --> 03:29:02.158]  Babies want to destroy their parents.
[03:29:02.938 --> 03:29:05.078]  I said one time, who's in charge here?
[03:29:05.779 --> 03:29:08.880]  And I think the congressman's right about that fact.
[03:29:09.940 --> 03:29:11.140]  Jerry, do you want some?
[03:29:11.160 --> 03:29:11.880]  Yeah, I got some.
[03:29:12.181 --> 03:29:12.561]  Jerry?
[03:29:12.581 --> 03:29:14.241]  Take a drink.
[03:29:14.261 --> 03:29:18.362]  You look a little dehydrated, brother.
[03:29:18.402 --> 03:29:19.723]  You seem a little dehydrated.
[03:29:19.763 --> 03:29:20.083]  You okay?
[03:29:21.031 --> 03:29:28.263]  It took a little longer on the floor than I had anticipated in the custody of the border patrol.
[03:29:28.904 --> 03:29:34.733]  Everyone started sending signals, the US, Mexico, Canada.
[03:29:36.588 --> 03:29:37.988]  That's not the accurate character.
[03:29:38.129 --> 03:29:40.909]  Some people call it AFTA-NAFTA, some call it NAFTA 2.0.
[03:29:41.470 --> 03:29:45.951]  We're working together to make past that.
[03:29:46.011 --> 03:29:47.331]  You seem a little dehydrated.
[03:29:47.391 --> 03:29:47.711]  You okay?
[03:29:48.512 --> 03:29:50.552]  You want to take a drink of this?
[03:29:50.912 --> 03:29:53.973]  So, but the president again stormed out.
[03:29:53.993 --> 03:29:55.854]  I think, what, first
[03:29:57.423 --> 03:29:59.044]  Pound the table, walk out the door.
[03:29:59.164 --> 03:30:05.186]  Uh, but I intend not to... If we... We're... We're the fat... There's three things.
[03:30:05.426 --> 03:30:05.966]  Three things.
[03:30:06.086 --> 03:30:06.686]  Three things.
[03:30:07.487 --> 03:30:10.328]  You wanna take a drink of this to give yourself something?
[03:30:10.908 --> 03:30:12.208]  How you feel, man?
[03:30:13.729 --> 03:30:15.369]  You feel okay?
[03:30:15.409 --> 03:30:15.689]  You alright?
[03:30:16.210 --> 03:30:20.851]  Okay, do you want to drink some of this and give you something?
[03:30:20.871 --> 03:30:25.173]  How you feel, man?
[03:30:25.193 --> 03:30:25.753]  You feel okay?
[03:30:27.116 --> 03:30:29.497]  We can walk and chew gum at the same time.
[03:30:29.757 --> 03:30:30.757]  I hope he can, too.
[03:30:30.997 --> 03:30:42.380]  I want to just put out a message right now to the Democrats because, look, your leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Nadler, are struggling.
[03:30:43.321 --> 03:30:46.822]  And so we've got Brain Force Plus at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:30:47.722 --> 03:30:54.724]  And if there has ever been an example of somebody that needs Brain Force Plus, the neural activator, it's Nancy Pelosi.
[03:30:55.788 --> 03:30:56.748]  And it's Jerry Nadler.

[03:31:48.908 --> 03:31:49.769]  You want to look sharp.

[03:33:05.988 --> 03:33:08.729]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.049 --> 03:33:09.929]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:10.029 --> 03:33:24.052]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:34.418 --> 03:33:40.983]  Matt Braggin had some big old storms, you know about those, roll through and knock out his power.
[03:33:41.703 --> 03:33:43.285]  But he's taking over in a moment.
[03:33:43.325 --> 03:33:46.027]  He's got a lot to say about the current escalations.
[03:33:46.087 --> 03:33:47.608]  Trump's press conference never happened.
[03:33:48.129 --> 03:33:51.211]  It became a congressional secret meeting at the White House.
[03:33:51.452 --> 03:33:52.873]  During the war room we should have news.
[03:33:53.353 --> 03:33:54.034]  We'll cover it.
[03:33:54.114 --> 03:33:55.855]  Infowars.com for its last show.
[03:33:57.136 --> 03:34:01.139]  But Ted Cruz, as you just heard, came out and said, hey, don't take Alex Jones' free speech away.
[03:34:02.096 --> 03:34:03.797]  But Jones said my dad killed Kennedy.
[03:34:03.817 --> 03:34:05.298]  No, I said your dad was in the CIA.
[03:34:05.539 --> 03:34:06.339]  You live in New Orleans.
[03:34:06.359 --> 03:34:07.300]  He was an anti-communist.
[03:34:07.800 --> 03:34:09.201]  And I got that from high-level sources.
[03:34:09.261 --> 03:34:12.464]  So stop footsieing around with Trump if you're mad at me about that.
[03:34:13.064 --> 03:34:15.586]  Now, let me get to one more piece of news, then Matt Bracken will take over.
[03:34:17.087 --> 03:34:17.748]  The Young Turks.
[03:34:17.988 --> 03:34:18.668]  Owen Benjamin.
[03:34:20.610 --> 03:34:21.931]  True News with Rick Wiles.
[03:34:22.471 --> 03:34:23.312]  What are the other channels?
[03:34:24.873 --> 03:34:25.934]  There are so many of these.
[03:34:27.958 --> 03:34:38.403]  Even Glenn Beck's co-host with his show that he does separate on The Blaze came out and said, Alex Jones did not send child porn to the Sandy Hook families.
[03:34:40.984 --> 03:34:45.827]  The judge first wanted all our emails, 9.6 million to Sandy Hook.
[03:34:49.008 --> 03:34:49.769]  We have nothing to hide.
[03:34:49.789 --> 03:34:51.170]  You usually get rid of emails every three years.
[03:34:51.210 --> 03:34:53.451]  We had them going back like 15 years.
[03:34:54.031 --> 03:34:55.772]  I was telling my data folks, why am I paying for this?
[03:34:57.588 --> 03:35:04.177]  They get them, they data mine them, they find hidden links in non-related death threats against me that we never open.
[03:35:04.197 --> 03:35:05.039]  The FBI admits it.
[03:35:05.319 --> 03:35:06.381]  It's in the news last week.
[03:35:07.458 --> 03:35:08.398]  Democrats get pissed.
[03:35:08.898 --> 03:35:10.679]  They go, Jones can't be the victim here.
[03:35:11.159 --> 03:35:16.800]  So on Monday they announced that I am guilty of sending child porn to the San Diego families.
[03:35:17.200 --> 03:35:18.040]  Total defamation.
[03:35:18.420 --> 03:35:19.160]  They sued us.
[03:35:19.680 --> 03:35:20.900]  They demanded them in discovery.
[03:35:20.940 --> 03:35:21.561]  It was hidden.
[03:35:21.601 --> 03:35:23.461]  They had to have metadata to find it.
[03:35:24.021 --> 03:35:25.021]  I said, that's suspicious.
[03:35:25.061 --> 03:35:26.762]  I'm not blaming them specifically for it.
[03:35:27.122 --> 03:35:28.822]  I'm saying whoever sent it, I'm going to get you.
[03:35:28.842 --> 03:35:30.422]  Now they're threatening to sue me over that.
[03:35:30.502 --> 03:35:30.742]  Great.
[03:35:30.802 --> 03:35:31.222]  Line up.
[03:35:31.302 --> 03:35:31.802]  You're going to lose.
[03:35:33.143 --> 03:35:34.063]  We're in a real 21st century war here.
[03:35:36.513 --> 03:35:47.297]  But I wanted to play the Glenn Beck blaze thing because they state all the fake facts that I sent people to harass the Sandhu family.
[03:35:47.497 --> 03:35:55.961]  But then they go, but it's true, he didn't send child porn, they just got all these emails because Jones sent too many.
[03:35:56.461 --> 03:35:58.662]  Because a lot of these guys on the show are lawyers, they're smart.
[03:35:59.770 --> 03:36:00.290]  They know.
[03:36:01.191 --> 03:36:03.252]  Well, you wouldn't send people unopened emails.
[03:36:03.292 --> 03:36:04.572]  That's not related to a suit.
[03:36:04.632 --> 03:36:05.593]  You never talk to these people.
[03:36:06.093 --> 03:36:12.035]  The judge ordered anything with the name Sandy Hook or all these family names or all these news terms.
[03:36:12.656 --> 03:36:13.996]  It was like 30, 40 terms.
[03:36:14.036 --> 03:36:14.456]  I forget.
[03:36:14.516 --> 03:36:16.957]  We had to search it, have law firms review it.
[03:36:17.318 --> 03:36:18.558]  Then they asked the judge.
[03:36:19.158 --> 03:36:20.439]  We've had like eight hearings on this.
[03:36:20.839 --> 03:36:23.180]  Make Jones open every attachment.
[03:36:23.820 --> 03:36:26.021]  We checked with three different data firms are like, well, that's like $200,000.
[03:36:28.223 --> 03:36:31.766]  Plus, data firms wouldn't do it, because you're going to open unattached stuff.
[03:36:31.786 --> 03:36:33.207]  You could open child porn.
[03:36:33.907 --> 03:36:35.709]  So it gets a little suspicious, doesn't it?
[03:36:35.869 --> 03:36:36.830]  Whoever's behind it.
[03:36:37.510 --> 03:36:38.651]  We refuse the judge.
[03:36:38.671 --> 03:36:41.093]  We say, we're not opening all the attachments we never open.
[03:36:41.994 --> 03:36:43.995]  She goes, okay, just give us the emails.
[03:36:44.756 --> 03:36:49.800]  And then they find in 12 emails, death-threatening me, hidden links to child porn.
[03:36:51.448 --> 03:36:53.809]  And my point here is, is that this blew up in their face.
[03:36:54.169 --> 03:36:55.429]  I don't just put a good face on things.
[03:36:55.649 --> 03:37:00.490]  Everyone I talk to, and every outlet out there says, oh my god, this is a hoax, this is bad.
[03:37:01.531 --> 03:37:05.152]  Except the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and others.
[03:37:05.192 --> 03:37:06.692]  They still are going with the hoax.
[03:37:08.633 --> 03:37:11.253]  Because they want to teach underlings to lie.
[03:37:13.054 --> 03:37:18.115]  And that means we're over the target, folks, that anybody could send you child porn, you never open it.
[03:37:18.475 --> 03:37:20.096]  Anybody could mail a postcard
[03:37:21.061 --> 03:37:25.502]  A child porn to your address, and you throw it away, or you call the police, they say you're guilty.
[03:37:25.842 --> 03:37:27.083]  No, the cops don't say you're guilty.
[03:37:27.303 --> 03:37:28.063]  The Democrats do.
[03:37:28.823 --> 03:37:34.305]  So the good news is, no one is buying this, but it shows the hysteria level they've gone to.
[03:37:34.705 --> 03:37:37.206]  So here's part of that Blaze TV.
[03:37:38.186 --> 03:37:40.647]  What's Glenn Beck's... I'm not trying to be funny here.
[03:37:41.007 --> 03:37:41.907]  What's his co-host's name?
[03:37:43.508 --> 03:37:44.308]  Shep or something?
[03:37:46.125 --> 03:37:48.947]  The point is, it's the co-host doing this.
[03:37:49.767 --> 03:37:52.909]  So here, even my enemies, having to admit the truth, here it is.
[03:37:52.929 --> 03:37:58.011]  The media is giving a good challenge here because of this story that's going on.
[03:37:58.091 --> 03:38:02.154]  He is currently being sued about the Sandy Hook situation.
[03:38:02.574 --> 03:38:05.595]  And so, here are the headlines from all over the media.
[03:38:05.635 --> 03:38:09.657]  And you'll notice some names on here that should supposedly be much better, right?
[03:38:09.677 --> 03:38:12.479]  Like, I mean, Raw Story, they're going to write whatever headline they want to write.
[03:38:12.819 --> 03:38:18.723]  But the New York Times is on here, BuzzFeed, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, and all of them pretty much say the same thing.
[03:38:18.823 --> 03:38:23.105]  Alex Jones sent emails containing child porn to Sandy Hook victim lawyers.
[03:38:23.125 --> 03:38:24.086]  Look at the New York Times.
[03:38:24.446 --> 03:38:28.169]  Alex Jones' legal team is said to have sent child porn in Sandy Hook's case.
[03:38:28.929 --> 03:38:31.811]  Alex Jones sent files containing child pornography to lawyers.
[03:38:32.511 --> 03:38:37.594]  What kind of psychopath sends child porn to the victims of a shooting?
[03:38:37.674 --> 03:38:40.016]  Like, this is, I mean, even for Alex Jones.
[03:38:40.476 --> 03:38:41.897]  Sounds completely insane.
[03:38:42.418 --> 03:38:45.440]  And it would be if it were at all true.
[03:38:45.961 --> 03:38:49.284]  This is like, I mean, you want to talk about media malpractice.
[03:38:50.279 --> 03:38:57.085]  What happened here is that Alex Jones is being sued, and they're trying to get the information about how he came up with these conspiracy theories.
[03:38:57.365 --> 03:39:09.455]  So the lawyers asked Alex Jones, in discovery in the lawsuit, to send him all of the files that were on the server, and all of the emails that were on the server, because we want to check the emails.
[03:39:09.855 --> 03:39:15.880]  So what he did, and this, you know, this isn't, you know, I don't know how high quality Alex Jones's lawyers are, but he just literally
[03:39:16.801 --> 03:39:17.441]  Overshared.
[03:39:17.481 --> 03:39:18.621]  He turned over everything.
[03:39:19.022 --> 03:39:25.463]  So he turned over not only things that he was, uh, he was, uh, you know, emailing internally, which is obviously the focus of the session.
[03:39:25.483 --> 03:39:26.163]  Let's pause for a minute.
[03:39:26.463 --> 03:39:27.123]  That's Stu.
[03:39:27.403 --> 03:39:28.524]  I looked up his name myself.
[03:39:29.464 --> 03:39:30.484]  I'm not being catty here.
[03:39:30.504 --> 03:39:31.804]  That's Stu, his co-host.
[03:39:32.605 --> 03:39:35.185]  And again, no, I didn't overproduce.
[03:39:35.945 --> 03:39:37.146]  We had like eight hearings.
[03:39:37.266 --> 03:39:38.826]  I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[03:39:39.977 --> 03:39:44.741]  And this judge said, you'll give us everything and make him open the attachments.
[03:39:44.761 --> 03:39:46.682]  Federal crime.
[03:39:47.023 --> 03:39:47.443]  Open them.
[03:39:47.763 --> 03:39:48.504]  We didn't open them.
[03:39:48.524 --> 03:39:49.965]  I said, no, your honor, we're not doing it.
[03:39:51.086 --> 03:39:51.526]  Didn't matter.
[03:39:51.546 --> 03:39:53.107]  They scanned them and found the hidden stuff.
[03:39:53.688 --> 03:39:55.750]  So again, someone mails you something.
[03:39:55.790 --> 03:39:56.350]  Are you guilty?
[03:39:56.430 --> 03:39:56.910]  No, you're not.
[03:39:57.271 --> 03:39:58.492]  Let's continue with Stu.
[03:39:59.212 --> 03:39:59.873]  That's his name.
[03:40:00.393 --> 03:40:00.974]  Beck's co-host.
[03:40:01.932 --> 03:40:03.655]  How do we know that's not a false flag up there?
[03:40:19.648 --> 03:40:20.289]  That's a great point.
[03:40:20.349 --> 03:40:20.789]  How do we know?
[03:40:20.929 --> 03:40:23.711]  I know, really, because I mean, that really is what should happen here.
[03:40:24.011 --> 03:40:25.172]  We should just say it's a false flag.
[03:40:25.252 --> 03:40:31.397]  But no, I mean, so basically this guy has a public, you know, whatever, public at Infowars.com.
[03:40:31.617 --> 03:40:33.939]  People are sending him, it's not him doing it.
[03:40:34.199 --> 03:40:36.781]  He gets the emails and in there are terrible files.
[03:40:37.241 --> 03:40:39.043]  He over shares and gives them everything.
[03:40:39.063 --> 03:40:42.906]  And then they go to the press and say, Alex Jones just sent us child porn.
[03:40:44.042 --> 03:40:49.285]  They sent him millions of emails, and in there were some public ones about child porn.
[03:40:49.806 --> 03:40:56.390]  You know, the fact that, like, that story is the real story is, you know, it's not even, it's nothing, right?
[03:40:56.430 --> 03:40:59.212]  Like, that shouldn't even be in public information.
[03:40:59.572 --> 03:41:01.373]  So that's enough of these guys.
[03:41:01.453 --> 03:41:02.374]  And I think it's what the left...
[03:41:02.854 --> 03:41:08.478]  But before they went to that, they regurgitated every lie about me, every piece of disinfo, everything again.
[03:41:08.898 --> 03:41:09.959]  They know full well what they're doing.
[03:41:10.600 --> 03:41:19.626]  Matt Bracken takes over next segment with his update for you on what he thinks has happened with Iran and what Trump's going to say coming up during the war room with a supposed press conference that hasn't happened.
[03:41:19.726 --> 03:41:19.966]  But!
[03:41:21.848 --> 03:41:25.811]  Clown World, ladies and gentlemen, the greatest comedy show on earth.
[03:41:26.937 --> 03:41:30.358]  Two nights, 20 plus candidates, and tons of laughs.
[03:41:31.098 --> 03:41:33.499]  June 26th and 27th, I'll be here co-hosting.
[03:41:33.959 --> 03:41:35.559]  Starts at 7pm live.
[03:41:36.019 --> 03:41:37.740]  TV and radio stations, you're welcome.
[03:41:38.140 --> 03:41:39.700]  We ask you to pick it up, please.
[03:41:40.141 --> 03:41:44.742]  Asking listeners to call local TV and radio stations and tell them you want us to pick it up.
[03:41:45.142 --> 03:41:46.082]  You want them to pick it up.
[03:41:46.602 --> 03:41:49.323]  We're going to have the 26th and 27th.
[03:41:50.043 --> 03:41:53.044]  That's next, what is that, next Wednesday and Thursday.
[03:41:53.604 --> 03:41:56.005]  We're going to have live coverage throughout.
[03:41:56.405 --> 03:41:59.347]  Clown World, all of the clown candidates.
[03:41:59.828 --> 03:42:01.149]  We're going to be covering it.
[03:42:01.209 --> 03:42:06.353]  You do not want to miss the coverage of Clown World coming up next week.
[03:42:07.674 --> 03:42:08.735]  I'm shooting off the hip here.
[03:42:09.115 --> 03:42:11.677]  What day is the 26th and 27th?
[03:42:13.118 --> 03:42:14.039]  That's Wednesday and Thursday.
[03:42:15.420 --> 03:42:16.401]  My little brain was right.
[03:42:17.121 --> 03:42:20.784]  So next Wednesday and Thursday, we'll not just have the David Knight Show at 8 a.m.
[03:42:20.824 --> 03:42:22.805]  and my show at 11 a.m.
[03:42:22.825 --> 03:42:24.527]  We're not just going to have Owen Schroeder
[03:42:26.243 --> 03:42:30.166]  At 3 p.m., we're going to have Clown World coverage with Matt Brackett.
[03:42:30.186 --> 03:42:32.087]  I'm sure he'll join us.
[03:42:32.107 --> 03:42:33.868]  7 o'clock until Clown World ends.
[03:42:34.388 --> 03:42:36.030]  And let's shove it down the Glover's throats.
[03:42:36.090 --> 03:42:37.150]  Let's make it huge.
[03:42:37.511 --> 03:42:41.013]  Let's have big audiences tune in because we're overriding their censorship.
[03:42:41.393 --> 03:42:43.114]  Please don't forget, they're trying to shut us down.
[03:42:43.434 --> 03:42:44.815]  Your purchases make it all possible.
[03:42:44.835 --> 03:42:45.556]  I'm very humble.
[03:42:45.576 --> 03:42:46.156]  I'm very thankful.
[03:43:10.335 --> 03:43:21.684]  Defiance or rebellion is something that has to be looked at as a neutral statement.
[03:43:23.486 --> 03:43:24.427]  Is defiance bad?
[03:43:26.075 --> 03:43:26.956]  Is rebellion bad?
[03:43:28.136 --> 03:43:29.077]  Is resistance bad?
[03:43:29.638 --> 03:43:35.121]  Well, it really is a question of what are you resisting?
[03:43:35.842 --> 03:43:37.043]  What are you rebelling against?
[03:43:37.063 --> 03:43:48.131]  The left pushes this whole narrative about their rebelling against oppression and their rebelling against people trying to tell them what to do or say, but no one's really telling them what to do or say.
[03:43:49.215 --> 03:43:50.056]  They're in charge.
[03:43:50.396 --> 03:43:51.536]  They run the big tech.
[03:43:51.576 --> 03:43:52.557]  They run the corporations.
[03:43:52.877 --> 03:43:54.038]  They run the society.
[03:43:54.078 --> 03:43:54.918]  They have their agenda.
[03:43:54.938 --> 03:44:02.963]  And they're openly the bullies, trying to dictate to us how to talk, how to dress, who to have sex with, how to live our lives.
[03:44:05.004 --> 03:44:12.969]  They're constantly lecturing us about microaggressions and telling us that we'll be arrested or taken off Facebook if we don't behave ourselves.
[03:44:13.289 --> 03:44:17.592]  These people are a clear and present danger to free societies.
[03:44:19.332 --> 03:44:24.414]  And so that's what I really want to telegraph to folks is, we know the modern threat to humanity.
[03:44:25.114 --> 03:44:26.514]  Every generation has a threat.
[03:44:27.575 --> 03:44:30.036]  Every generation has a big war.
[03:44:31.556 --> 03:44:35.858]  But this is a political and cultural war, an economic war.
[03:44:37.118 --> 03:44:38.358]  It's raging in 2019.
[03:44:38.839 --> 03:44:48.742]  And the establishment is so angry that organizations like InfoWars are still on air.
[03:44:50.828 --> 03:44:59.253]  They need to have victories because despite their trillions of dollars and their corporate dominance, people are rejecting them on a planetary scale.
[03:44:59.533 --> 03:45:01.775]  Globalism is in full retreat.
[03:45:02.535 --> 03:45:04.897]  It's in full collapse.
[03:45:07.338 --> 03:45:13.502]  And so it's rearing its ugly head and hitting us with every nasty trick it had planned for the future.
[03:45:14.522 --> 03:45:16.183]  For their conquest of humanity.
[03:45:17.204 --> 03:45:18.064]  And it's still failing.
[03:45:19.045 --> 03:45:20.006]  But for those of us
[03:45:21.317 --> 03:45:27.001]  At the front of the lines, or in the capital ships, we're the targets, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:45:27.281 --> 03:45:37.108]  And I never thought of InfoWars as a major battleship, or an aircraft carrier, or a destroyer, or a submarine attack group, but the enemy sees it as that because we are.
[03:45:38.429 --> 03:45:45.534]  And it's essential we stay in the fight, and never surrender, and never waver, and never back down, and never give up.
[03:45:47.031 --> 03:46:02.180]  That's why, with all the unprecedented attempts to criminally set us up and put me in prison and shut down this operation that have been all over the national news, we have launched Save InfoWars emergency special that's only running for one week.
[03:46:02.540 --> 03:46:04.541]  50% off all InfoWars life
[03:46:05.523 --> 03:46:10.769]  Nutraceuticals and supplements, free shipping and double Patriot Points on your next order.
[03:46:10.789 --> 03:46:11.309]  Instead of 5%, 10%.
[03:46:11.970 --> 03:46:14.492]  That's an additional 10% off every dollar.
[03:46:15.614 --> 03:46:18.657]  Get 50% off all InfoWars Live formulas, free shipping, double Patriot Points and more.
[03:46:19.037 --> 03:46:25.104]  This could be your last chance to stock up on top InfoWars Live formulas before they are completely out of stock.
[03:46:26.620 --> 03:46:29.643]  And again, that's the point I've gotten to of having to admit the attack we're under.
[03:46:30.003 --> 03:46:37.670]  The warehouse has confirmed we are already selling out of survivable SHIELD X2, Dayson Iodine, Suprametal Vitality, and DNA Force.
[03:46:37.730 --> 03:46:44.235]  Plus, now is the time to secure your order before they completely sell out and know that you fund us into the future.
[03:46:44.595 --> 03:46:49.400]  Take advantage of this massive special and support the defense of free speech and reality.
[03:46:50.300 --> 03:46:55.662]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've proven that we're the enemy of tyranny.
[03:46:56.203 --> 03:46:58.304]  We're pro-life, we're pro-God, we're pro-human.
[03:46:58.744 --> 03:47:00.705]  We need your support or we'll be destroyed.
[03:47:01.345 --> 03:47:02.045]  Please support us.
[03:47:05.907 --> 03:47:08.508]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:24.895 --> 03:47:29.356]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:30.456 --> 03:47:32.537]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:47:33.037 --> 03:47:35.718]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:39.679 --> 03:47:41.859]  Okay, I've got the next 10 minutes.
[03:47:42.419 --> 03:47:45.580]  And no time for callers, but don't worry, I've got plenty to say.
[03:47:46.340 --> 03:47:48.841]  Just winding up what Alex was saying in the last segment.
[03:47:49.480 --> 03:47:54.926]  All of those major media outlets that ran those slanderous headlines, they knew what they were doing.
[03:47:55.567 --> 03:47:56.548]  That's the whole point.
[03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:58.630]  It's like the Trump Tower meeting.
[03:47:58.650 --> 03:48:01.674]  The point is just to get the headline.
[03:48:02.620 --> 03:48:13.186]  Half of Americans that are only watching the news when they're flipping from reality shows to sitcoms, all they're going to see is something like, Alex Jones sent kiddie porn.
[03:48:13.586 --> 03:48:13.966]  Period.
[03:48:14.507 --> 03:48:15.867]  Mission, that's it.
[03:48:16.087 --> 03:48:16.968]  Mission accomplished.
[03:48:17.448 --> 03:48:18.589]  They got what they wanted.
[03:48:18.669 --> 03:48:19.049]  That's it.
[03:48:19.349 --> 03:48:20.090]  That's all they wanted.
[03:48:20.710 --> 03:48:21.570]  Truth be damned.
[03:48:21.810 --> 03:48:24.252]  And that's why it truly is fake media.
[03:48:25.172 --> 03:48:25.392]  Okay.
[03:48:25.773 --> 03:48:26.393]  It's been a week.
[03:48:27.254 --> 03:48:32.976]  It's been a week since the tanker attacks in the Straits of Hormuz.
[03:48:33.176 --> 03:48:45.781]  I guess I was a contrarian around here because I actually do believe it was an Iranian mine planted by Iranians and removed by Iranians.
[03:48:46.844 --> 03:48:49.346]  I have a lot of reasons to think this.
[03:48:49.766 --> 03:49:11.961]  One of them is I may be the only person that you've listened to all week that's actually ever in his life held a limpet mine in his hands or swum underwater with a limpet mine using no bubble rebreathers, been a passenger on a swimmer delivery vehicle, getting under ships, planting mines, climbing up on ships.
[03:49:12.501 --> 03:49:16.564]  So a lot of what you're hearing are so-called former analysts
[03:49:17.204 --> 03:49:27.330]  And they might be really knowledgeable within their territory, but when it comes to mines and ships, give me a little bit of credit, alright?
[03:49:28.011 --> 03:49:29.071]  I've been there and done it.
[03:49:29.732 --> 03:49:36.416]  Now, I've heard people say, if they wanted to sink a tanker, they would have put the mine under the waterline.
[03:49:36.956 --> 03:49:43.500]  This shows on many levels that these so-called experts have no effing clue what the eff they're talking about.
[03:49:44.096 --> 03:49:55.183]  For one thing, a tanker is not a giant bathtub with one big floating pool of oil inside.
[03:49:55.703 --> 03:49:58.005]  It's divided into dozens of cells.
[03:49:58.745 --> 03:50:05.309]  Putting a hole in one cell of a tanker is not going to cause it to sink, whether it's above or below the waterline.
[03:50:05.869 --> 03:50:13.134]  A tanker is actually, within constraints of a fairly small explosive device, is a pretty hard item to sink.
[03:50:13.911 --> 03:50:27.317]  But what you can do, if you're very good, is cause a massive fire that could spread through the ship and then cause, you know, a huge photogenic video opportunity for the world press.
[03:50:27.837 --> 03:50:34.140]  So I would say out of four limpet mines on two ships, the Iranians had one success.
[03:50:34.280 --> 03:50:35.621]  That's that picture right there.
[03:50:36.461 --> 03:50:41.183]  The other two, on one ship, the mine didn't even detonate.
[03:50:41.869 --> 03:50:44.791]  So they had to, whoops, come running back and take it off.
[03:50:45.292 --> 03:51:01.064]  Anybody that says, hey, well, maybe it was Saudis dressed up like Iranians with an exact duplicate of an exact, you know, customized, made Iranian produced speedboat that came and took it off to make the Iranians look bad.
[03:51:01.624 --> 03:51:04.106]  Listen, folks, let's get real.
[03:51:05.228 --> 03:51:12.098]  Just because we have deep state domestic enemies that are globalists, that are real POS's, I get it.
[03:51:12.702 --> 03:51:13.923]  They're domestic enemies.
[03:51:14.503 --> 03:51:24.267]  That doesn't mean that our real foreign enemies are suddenly cuddly teddy bears that are just trying to get along in the world.
[03:51:24.887 --> 03:51:32.050]  And it's mean old Uncle Sam and Donald Trump who's being tricked by the neocons because Iran just wants peace.
[03:51:32.130 --> 03:51:33.570]  They're just wonderful guys.
[03:51:34.030 --> 03:51:35.571]  This is such a load of crap.
[03:51:36.420 --> 03:51:39.125]  Hold two things in your mind at the same time.
[03:51:39.545 --> 03:51:45.856]  Yes, we have deep state, domestic enemy globalists that would love to sabotage Donald Trump.
[03:51:45.876 --> 03:51:46.337]  I get it.
[03:51:48.812 --> 03:51:50.513]  And they would love to draw us into a war.
[03:51:50.673 --> 03:51:51.093]  I get it.
[03:51:51.514 --> 03:52:00.499]  But at the same time, we have long-term, very real enemies, the guys yelling, death to America, since the 70s.
[03:52:00.979 --> 03:52:05.562]  And I was in Beirut in the early 80s, when they blew up a bunch of Marines.
[03:52:06.162 --> 03:52:09.164]  And it was really the Iranians that did it, okay?
[03:52:09.444 --> 03:52:10.925]  It wasn't the CIA.
[03:52:11.465 --> 03:52:13.066]  It really was the Iranians.
[03:52:13.307 --> 03:52:14.867]  They really do hate our guts.
[03:52:14.928 --> 03:52:17.089]  They really do consider us the great Satan.
[03:52:17.649 --> 03:52:20.494]  And there's an important generational aspect to this.
[03:52:21.075 --> 03:52:26.644]  That is, that the leaders of the Iranian revolution, going back to 79 and the 80s, they are getting very old.
[03:52:29.887 --> 03:52:32.770]  You can say, well, you know, they just believe in the afterlife.
[03:52:32.810 --> 03:52:33.390]  That's true.
[03:52:33.470 --> 03:52:38.294]  But human beings want to see things happen during their time on this planet.
[03:52:38.835 --> 03:52:44.519]  And the generation that has still got a death grip on Iran, they're going to be gone.
[03:52:44.640 --> 03:52:46.681]  They're aging out rapidly.
[03:52:47.202 --> 03:52:52.967]  And if there's going to be anything happening with the great Satan, they want it to happen now.
[03:52:53.627 --> 03:52:59.132]  Now, going back to 1988, that was what was called Operation Praying Mantis.
[03:52:59.192 --> 03:53:05.878]  That was the end of the tanker wars, which lasted through the mid-80s, concurrent with the Iran-Iraq War.
[03:53:06.458 --> 03:53:11.182]  The Iranians were putting sea mines into the Persian Gulf.
[03:53:11.582 --> 03:53:12.503]  Ships were hitting them.
[03:53:13.024 --> 03:53:14.225]  It was a low-level war.
[03:53:14.285 --> 03:53:15.326]  I know a lot about it.
[03:53:15.786 --> 03:53:17.247]  Navy SEALs were involved.
[03:53:18.644 --> 03:53:22.688]  Countering this, they weren't just dropping mines out of wooden dowels.
[03:53:22.748 --> 03:53:28.174]  They had actual mine-laying vessels, or military vessels, rolling mines off the back.
[03:53:28.734 --> 03:53:31.477]  I know this for a fact, and let me tell you something.
[03:53:31.517 --> 03:53:39.845]  This is what I learned, that you can snipe somebody from a helicopter, especially if you're on a, you know, ship that's making some noise.
[03:53:39.925 --> 03:53:41.447]  It's got an ambient engine hum.
[03:53:42.111 --> 03:53:49.313]  We can snipe people from a helicopter when the people being sniped don't even know there's a helicopter in the sky.
[03:53:49.653 --> 03:53:50.273]  Alright, folks?
[03:53:50.673 --> 03:53:57.094]  It's nighttime, you're making noise, you're laying mines, the next thing you know, people are dropping and bleeding around you.
[03:53:57.574 --> 03:53:59.895]  We were in that war ever since then.
[03:53:59.935 --> 03:54:09.197]  There are SEALs in this war now, sure, but they're not dressing up like Iranians to plant fake limpet mines on ships to make the poor innocent Iranians look bad.
[03:54:10.074 --> 03:54:12.415]  Hold the two things in your mind at the same time.
[03:54:12.855 --> 03:54:14.056]  They really do hate us.
[03:54:14.576 --> 03:54:18.838]  And the big weapon that Iran has is geography.
[03:54:19.079 --> 03:54:21.300]  Geography and anti-ship missiles.
[03:54:22.440 --> 03:54:27.983]  There are articles floating around about, you know, what can the Iranian missiles do against U.S.
[03:54:28.063 --> 03:54:28.883]  naval vessels?
[03:54:29.304 --> 03:54:30.404]  That's a debate, sure.
[03:54:30.944 --> 03:54:35.927]  But what they can do against tankers is stop tankers from going through the Straits of Hormuz.
[03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:46.019]  They have thousands of variants of mobile missile launchers that are arrayed in that arc all the way around the Strait of Hormuz in range.
[03:54:46.360 --> 03:54:48.021]  So they don't have to be sitting on the beach.
[03:54:48.422 --> 03:54:51.345]  They can be 100, 200 miles back in the mountains.
[03:54:52.105 --> 03:54:59.633]  An important lesson that everybody learned after Operation Desert Storm was that mobile missiles work.
[03:55:00.453 --> 03:55:09.359]  Much bigger Scud missiles were being fired from Iraq into Saudi Arabia, even as Desert Storm ended.
[03:55:09.739 --> 03:55:14.382]  It ended politically in negotiated settlement, but the missile teams were never stopped.
[03:55:14.762 --> 03:55:19.345]  And those were gigantic firetruck-sized Scud missiles out in the open desert.
[03:55:20.012 --> 03:55:27.515]  If you look at the map of the Strait of Hormuz, you see it's very rugged terrain, full of canyons and gullies.
[03:55:28.596 --> 03:55:45.263]  And the Iranians, what they've been doing for the last 30 years, since we whipped their butt with Operation Praying Manus and sunk half their navy, they've developed what they consider their trump card, which is the ability to absolutely choke off the Strait of Hormuz.
[03:55:45.954 --> 03:55:49.681]  And it's not America that is directly the target right now.
[03:55:50.141 --> 03:55:53.307]  The target is Europe and Japan and Korea.
[03:55:53.988 --> 03:55:59.969]  So, literally, Trump could tell Merkel and Prime Minister Abe, hey, it's not my problem.
[03:56:00.269 --> 03:56:01.830]  We've got all the energy we need.
[03:56:02.190 --> 03:56:03.110]  Sucks to be you.
[03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:05.110]  You should probably have a navy.
[03:56:05.451 --> 03:56:08.031]  We're not going to go to war for the Strait of Hormuz.
[03:56:08.171 --> 03:56:09.151]  That would be an option.
[03:56:09.191 --> 03:56:11.252]  I'm sure the neocons are not going to entertain that.
[03:56:11.592 --> 03:56:16.113]  They're going to say that would cause a global depression if the Iranians
[03:56:16.693 --> 03:56:29.420]  You know, start plinking tankers from their thousands of truck mobile missile launchers, truck-borne anti-ship missiles that we literally cannot find and cannot stop.
[03:56:29.540 --> 03:56:35.883]  Not when you've got thousands of them in many thousands of caves and other hiding places.
[03:56:36.503 --> 03:56:37.024]  We're good to go.
[03:56:51.320 --> 03:57:06.430]  And if they do it, this is part of that apocalyptic end times scenario that that old generation of Iranians I was talking about, the ones that want to see this big fight get on with the great Satan while they're still alive to appreciate it.
[03:57:06.910 --> 03:57:09.652]  You know, if this tit for tat rises to a certain level,
[03:57:10.578 --> 03:57:13.519]  We think, oh, our Navy can just go in and wipe them out.
[03:57:13.599 --> 03:57:13.919]  Sure.
[03:57:14.339 --> 03:57:17.320]  But we can't find all those truck-mounted mobile missiles.
[03:57:17.900 --> 03:57:23.002]  And that's what's going to choke off the Strait of Hormuz and kill the West's economy.
[03:57:23.382 --> 03:57:26.723]  Not America, necessarily, but Europe, Japan, and Korea.
[03:57:27.043 --> 03:57:33.405]  They'll be on the hotline with Trump saying, please, please, you've got to use your Navy to open the Strait of Hormuz.
[03:57:33.785 --> 03:57:36.586]  So this is the Trump card that the Iranians are holding.
[03:57:37.147 --> 03:57:38.630]  And we're gonna see how it plays out.
[03:57:39.050 --> 03:57:40.453]  But God bless our U.S.
[03:57:40.493 --> 03:57:43.019]  Navy that's in harm's way inside a missile range.
[03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:45.864]  They gotta have their game on every second.
[03:57:46.366 --> 03:57:47.287]  I'll see you next week.
[03:57:53.991 --> 03:58:02.896]  Let me just tell listeners about something that is the very best product for your telomeres, for your mitochondrial DNA, that's the antioxidant that's next level.
[03:58:03.076 --> 03:58:11.881]  The PQQ, the CoQ10, the amount of it in here, depending on the equation, something like 40 boxes of the same chemical that's naturally occurring in blueberries.
[03:58:12.061 --> 03:58:12.781]  It's ridiculous.
[03:58:12.901 --> 03:58:13.341]  The CoQ10, PPQ,
[03:58:14.582 --> 03:58:17.843]  We have the organically derived, and by that it's not synthetic.
[03:58:18.103 --> 03:58:23.465]  Most of the stuff that you see on the shelves, a tiny bottle of PQQ or CoQ10, will be like 50 bucks, because even a synthetic is expensive.
[03:58:23.605 --> 03:58:25.706]  This is the organically derived.
[03:58:26.126 --> 03:58:27.046]  This is the real stuff.
[03:58:27.206 --> 03:58:38.650]  I want to warn you, when I first started taking it five years ago, this is DNA Force Plus, when I cut my finger off like 15 years ago, they reattached the finger, and you can see that right there where it cut off, it was hanging by a piece of skin right here.
[03:58:38.670 --> 03:58:40.371]  It doesn't cut cleanly like you see in the movies.
[03:58:41.051 --> 03:58:41.792]  Then tore it off.
[03:58:42.092 --> 03:58:43.513]  It was numb all the way up here.
[03:58:43.673 --> 03:58:45.814]  And the strangest thing is I started taking DNA force.
[03:58:46.015 --> 03:58:47.556]  The feeling came back in my finger.
[03:58:47.616 --> 03:58:49.117]  First it tingled and it came back.
[03:58:49.297 --> 03:58:50.378]  I was like, this is incredible.
[03:58:50.458 --> 03:58:56.001]  But I'm going to warn you, most people that have old injuries and where nerves have kind of died out, this isn't just regenerating your cells.
[03:58:56.182 --> 03:58:59.664]  This is just slowing the shrinkage of telomeres, which is the same thing as making them last longer.
