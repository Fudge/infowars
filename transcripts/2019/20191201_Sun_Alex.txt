[00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.553]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:20.483]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:31.216]  So, multinational corporations are openly censoring nationalists, patriots, Christians, pre-marketers, just common sense folks that want unity and freedom.
[00:00:31.617 --> 00:00:32.077]  Americans.
[00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:40.103]  All they fund, race war, social division, dozens of TV shows and movies a month coming out where white people are hunted down and murdered.
[00:00:42.846 --> 00:00:45.328]  CNN says if you believe in the nation existing, you're a Nazi.
[00:00:46.288 --> 00:00:48.991]  True authoritarianism is here, it's making its move against the country.
[00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:56.752]  And yes, President Trump in many ways is doing a good job opposing it, but he's not defending the people from this type of garbage.
[00:00:56.792 --> 00:00:59.934]  He came out and exposed the hunt and said it's designed to get people killed in mass.
[00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:04.596]  They didn't release the film, didn't censor it, just pointed out it was going to get mass killings going.
[00:01:06.037 --> 00:01:14.641]  So now they've just got all these other movies coming out basically under the same name with
[00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:22.050]  Two's hunting down the evil Christians, I guess.
[00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:24.811]  That's the show.
[00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.292]  We just broke down the articles up on Infowars.com.
[00:01:28.432 --> 00:01:33.034]  New Amazon show features white people wearing red mega hats being hunted as Nazis.
[00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:35.454]  Series starts Al Pacino.
[00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:39.656]  There's numerous similarities to the hunt, including
[00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:46.534]  And that's just so sick.
[00:01:46.554 --> 00:01:56.618]  And then the left says we're calling for violence when they're the quote anti-fascist funded by the most famous living fascist who worked directly for Hitler.
[00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.919]  You know him as George Soros.
[00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.440]  You cannot make up the magnitude of that.
[00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:05.982]  Jason in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:06.423]  Welcome.
[00:02:08.324 --> 00:02:11.165]  Alex, how does it feel to be public enemy number one?
[00:02:12.814 --> 00:02:21.001]  You know, I'm just promoting Americana and Unity, so I get called a Nazi that needs to be silenced, and then they've got all these TV shows and movies saying I need to be murdered.
[00:02:22.702 --> 00:02:34.251]  I think that there's a delicious irony to the fact that Sacha Baron Cohen is with the ADL calling for the arrest of the tech heads when they were complicit with Infowars being deplatformed.
[00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.311]  I haven't played that clip yet when they gave Tim Cook the award for Leading Mighty Platforming.
[00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:45.472]  Yeah, no, he's out there saying, purge Alex Jones and everybody like him.
[00:02:45.812 --> 00:02:46.952]  He said, this is just the beginning.
[00:02:47.492 --> 00:02:48.912]  He said, we want him totally destroyed.
[00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.913]  And then he said, we're going to arrest the tech heads if they don't submit to us.
[00:02:51.973 --> 00:02:53.333]  And people say, that's insane.
[00:02:53.793 --> 00:02:55.014]  That's not Sacha Baron Cohen.
[00:02:55.054 --> 00:02:56.314]  That's the people behind him.
[00:02:56.354 --> 00:02:57.214]  That's what they plan.
[00:02:57.234 --> 00:02:59.054]  And they've already gotten so much done.
[00:02:59.074 --> 00:03:02.455]  I'm just wondering how far this is going to go.
[00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:10.149]  Well, they're tempted to run a roughshod over the silent majority.
[00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.154]  But contained within that silent majority is a very pissed-off minority.
[00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:21.962]  And InfoWars is a repeater, it is an amplifier for that silent majority.
[00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:23.452]  We're good to go.
[00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:38.512]  Keep landing on them, brother.
[00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:39.713]  That is what InfoWars is.
[00:03:39.813 --> 00:03:42.154]  It's really a voice of the populist liberty movement.
[00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:49.257]  And the globalists want to shut us down so they can then speak for us and say horrible things in our name once they've stolen our identity.
[00:03:49.617 --> 00:03:51.038]  That's what censorship is really about.
[00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:52.279]  Stealing the identity.
[00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.880]  That's why it's critical we stay on air so they can't steal our identity.
[00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:04.584]  Well, they want to shut InfoWars down because InfoWars has been targeting and relentlessly hammering the enemy with the truth.
[00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.855]  We've been broadcasting that message out there to wake up all these individuals that really are falling for this nonsense that they're putting out there.
[00:04:13.297 --> 00:04:28.833]  And all of this narrative that they're putting out there against the President, against Americana, against freedom of choice and self-determination, and InfoWars has been a thorn in their side, and that's why they want to get rid of you, and that is exactly why InfoWars is not going to quit.
[00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:29.954]  We're going to support you.
[00:04:30.154 --> 00:04:35.960]  You have the support of all the listeners out there and all the pitchers that are actively engaged in doing something in this fight.
[00:04:37.213 --> 00:04:39.134]  Beautiful brother, God bless you and keep it up.
[00:04:39.234 --> 00:04:39.494]  Yeah.
[00:04:40.254 --> 00:04:41.194]  This is advertising.
[00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:42.535]  That's what Hollywood's doing.
[00:04:42.555 --> 00:04:45.196]  When they put out all these movies and shows saying, any Trump supporter, kill them.
[00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:46.196]  They're all Nazis.
[00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:48.137]  They're trying to get people to go out and start killing.
[00:04:48.637 --> 00:04:49.697]  And it's just so criminal.
[00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:51.378]  These people are psychotic.
[00:04:51.778 --> 00:04:53.258]  Hollywood is psychotic.
[00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:54.659]  It hates America.
[00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.280]  It's trying to take America down with it, and it's not going to happen.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.700]  Thank you, sir.
[00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:05.512]  Who is Alex Jones?
[00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:13.899]  Mainstream media calls him a conspiracy theorist, fake news, crazy, and worst of all, a fear monger.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.065]  But the only thing to truly fear is missing out on all the great specials at InfoWarsTore.com!

[00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:04.942]  Fear of missing out is a serious condition and can only be treated by going...
[00:06:05.911 --> 00:06:08.033]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:13.756]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:32.289]  So, the hunt was coming out a few months ago, and it was where the left kidnaps people wearing Make America Great Again hats and takes them out to a farm and hunts them.
[00:06:34.471 --> 00:06:34.711]  Well,
[00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:39.802]  Folks knew that was going to cause mass shootings, and so they didn't release the film.
[00:06:40.882 --> 00:06:51.925]  But now they've released Hunters, where anyone wearing Make America Great Again hats are really secretly Nazis, and get hunted down and killed by Antifa.
[00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:57.186]  This is what Hollywood's pushing, while running around saying, oh, we're not violent, we're not bad.
[00:06:58.526 --> 00:06:59.667]  Totally insane.
[00:07:00.947 --> 00:07:04.908]  What resembles the Nazis is the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, on the left in this country.
[00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:16.091]  And now we have Sacha Baron Cohen speaking for the ADL coming out and saying, arrest the heads of Big Tech if they don't give us total control over what they're doing.
[00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:20.894]  He said, it's only the beginning what's been done to Alex Jones.
[00:07:20.914 --> 00:07:22.535]  We want them totally destroyed.
[00:07:25.877 --> 00:07:29.339]  And the ADL's out there saying, fire Stephen Miller, saying he's a white supremacist.
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.060]  Totally insane.
[00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:34.342]  And you say that doesn't make sense.
[00:07:34.362 --> 00:07:35.783]  Well, to the zombie followers,
[00:07:36.923 --> 00:07:37.664]  They believe that.
[00:07:38.364 --> 00:07:41.407]  Now, the ADL and Southern Provincial Law Center knows full well they're liars.
[00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:44.829]  And they look completely freaked out while they're out there saying it.
[00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:47.011]  I mean, they're being directed in order to do this.
[00:07:48.172 --> 00:07:52.575]  I shot a very important video, ADL launches hostile takeover against Silicon Valley Big Six.
[00:07:55.157 --> 00:07:56.879]  It's at newswars.com and band.video.
[00:07:56.899 --> 00:07:57.439]  Please spread it.
[00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:59.641]  It's really an imperative emergency message.
[00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:00.361]  Get it out there.
[00:08:01.342 --> 00:08:03.024]  Everything we do is important, but this is paramount.
[00:08:03.864 --> 00:08:05.926]  Because this is what the next phase is.
[00:08:08.766 --> 00:08:09.867]  And it has to be opposed.
[00:08:11.087 --> 00:08:12.068]  Legally and lawfully.
[00:08:15.489 --> 00:08:17.430]  Because America is not the Nazis.
[00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:19.812]  And the First Amendment is not Nazi.
[00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:24.954]  People trying to destroy it are authoritarian and are closer to Nazis than anybody in this country.
[00:08:25.795 --> 00:08:26.395]  And are dangerous.
[00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:32.638]  The globalists are upset that Trump's in there and that they haven't fully brought the country down.
[00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:33.679]  And now?
[00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:41.855]  They want a civil war, and they're pushing for one, and Trump sits there and allows this to take place when it's all illegal.
[00:08:43.716 --> 00:08:48.438]  That's Trump's greatest failing, is nothing's been done to stop this, or to stand up against this.
[00:08:48.779 --> 00:08:50.359]  Oh, we're told on the 9th now.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:58.664]  For sure, the Inspector General report comes out, and we're now hearing about FBI agents that falsified reports about Russia connections.
[00:08:58.764 --> 00:08:59.084]  Okay.
[00:09:00.285 --> 00:09:01.265]  I want to see indictments.
[00:09:01.305 --> 00:09:02.106]  I want to see them now.
[00:09:05.151 --> 00:09:23.062]  Because the groups creating this hate hoax are trying to ride it towards total control over communications in this country and then a purge, close quote, imprisonment and purges of those that don't submit to the left's will.
[00:09:24.102 --> 00:09:32.608]  Sacha Baron Cohen, who made his money off of doing the most obscene stuff you can imagine in this free country, now says
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.021]  The ADL will decide.
[00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.743]  And they already run Big Tech.
[00:09:36.763 --> 00:09:37.424]  I have the articles.
[00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:38.525]  Right here.
[00:09:38.545 --> 00:09:38.965]  We'll cover it.
[00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:39.386]  Bottom of the hour.
[00:09:39.406 --> 00:09:41.047]  I'm going to go back to your phone calls right now.
[00:09:41.087 --> 00:09:42.829]  But YouTube to censor controversial content.
[00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:45.332]  ADL on board for running the flagging.
[00:09:47.145 --> 00:09:47.946]  But that's not enough.
[00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:49.407]  Now he wants total control.
[00:09:49.427 --> 00:09:50.368]  We're going to your phone calls.
[00:09:50.428 --> 00:09:54.673]  Please don't forget that it's your financial support that keeps us on air, keeps the reporters on the ground.
[00:09:55.313 --> 00:09:58.476]  They don't want us here during 2020 if we encounter globalist lies.
[00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:02.000]  They want us off the air so they can misrepresent what we've said and done.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.382]  That's why staying on air is so critical.
[00:10:04.723 --> 00:10:10.548]  Not just to get new stories out to expose the globalists, but so they can't steal our identity and use the captured
[00:10:11.329 --> 00:10:16.810]  Logo of Infowars to put out this info, which they're doing in movies and TV shows and everywhere.
[00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.390]  They know we're the populist movement.
[00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:24.572]  They know we really represent it as like a Roman standard, basically, and they want that standard captured.
[00:10:24.592 --> 00:10:30.573]  Because they know we're legitimate, we're good, we're loving, we care, we want to bring people together.
[00:10:30.853 --> 00:10:35.274]  That scares these monsters on the globalist left, funded by the Chi-Coms and others.
[00:10:36.014 --> 00:10:37.194]  A true alliance of evil.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:43.021]  But of course a globalist takeover of the country is going to try to brand the resistance as Nazis.
[00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:44.862]  Because they know America doesn't like Nazis.
[00:10:45.602 --> 00:10:49.643]  And Hollywood is just totally complicit in this and will never recover from what they've done.
[00:10:51.484 --> 00:10:53.225]  The NFL has 40% less viewers.
[00:10:53.365 --> 00:10:54.305]  Hollywood's falling apart.
[00:10:54.925 --> 00:10:57.806]  But Hollywood was just a means to an end.
[00:10:57.866 --> 00:10:58.926]  So it's being expended.
[00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:02.648]  It's being destroyed in an attempt to finally capture this country fully.
[00:11:02.688 --> 00:11:03.548]  It's all about power.
[00:11:06.124 --> 00:11:09.425]  Please remember that we have the Big Black Friday specials running.
[00:11:09.445 --> 00:11:13.147]  We've had a lot of big specials this year, but this is the biggest yet with triple Patriot points.

[00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:36.782]  Super Silver Wound Gel is over the top.

[00:11:38.002 --> 00:11:38.402]  P.M.

[00:11:43.024 --> 00:11:44.005]  That's our biggest special.
[00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:45.226]  It's an amazing product.

[00:12:53.722 --> 00:12:54.703]  We sell more of that than anything.
[00:12:55.998 --> 00:12:56.778]  Don't make a lot of money on it.
[00:12:56.798 --> 00:12:59.079]  We sell it very close to cost, but it's our big loss leader.
[00:12:59.939 --> 00:13:02.200]  Other brands that are similar, 60 bucks a piece, discounted at 40.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.660]  Ours is normally 40, usually sell for about $25.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.522]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're putting it in free with every order of DNA Force Plus.
[00:13:11.022 --> 00:13:12.683]  No excuse not to get that.

[00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:23.330]  Massive sale.
[00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.450]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:29.033]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls right now, into the next segment, and then right through the rest of the broadcast today.
[00:13:29.713 --> 00:13:33.195]  So much more to get into, but this is really a draconian time.
[00:13:36.385 --> 00:13:39.647]  Why is it that the screeching, wicked left is so scared of us?
[00:13:40.047 --> 00:13:44.449]  Because they know, folks, that we're fighting the racism and the cultural division they're pushing.
[00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:46.430]  They know we're the real classical liberals.
[00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.210]  They're the vicious, satanic left.
[00:13:48.591 --> 00:13:50.191]  We're exposing their pedophile rings.
[00:13:50.572 --> 00:13:51.472]  That's all coming down.
[00:13:51.512 --> 00:13:52.412]  So they're very scared.
[00:13:52.773 --> 00:13:56.154]  And they should be, because revelation of the truth is bringing them down.
[00:13:56.194 --> 00:13:57.355]  They are falling right now.
[00:13:57.655 --> 00:14:00.816]  They're hoping to start a violent civil war because we're intellectually winning.
[00:14:00.836 --> 00:14:02.197]  That's why we need to be non-violent.
[00:14:02.817 --> 00:14:07.899]  Offensively, but protect ourselves as well and be ready to be watching your back because this is a very serious time.
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.181]  Let's go ahead and talk to Casey in Mississippi.
[00:14:12.201 --> 00:14:12.741]  Thanks for holding.
[00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:13.081]  Go ahead.
[00:14:14.662 --> 00:14:15.522]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:14:15.682 --> 00:14:16.282]  I appreciate it.
[00:14:16.703 --> 00:14:17.063]  Thank you, sir.
[00:14:17.103 --> 00:14:17.323]  Go ahead.
[00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:18.743]  All right.
[00:14:18.783 --> 00:14:23.886]  Well, when it comes to the ADL, I think people need to educate themselves on the history of this organization.
[00:14:24.326 --> 00:14:31.168]  And you can get a pretty good synopsis if you look at the executive intelligence review from 1993 called The Ugly Truth About the ADL.
[00:14:33.959 --> 00:14:37.121]  Yes, the LaRouche Group did a very good analysis of it.
[00:14:37.161 --> 00:14:37.841]  Is that who you're talking about?
[00:14:38.522 --> 00:14:38.842]  Yes, sir.
[00:14:40.423 --> 00:14:40.843]  Absolutely.
[00:14:40.863 --> 00:14:43.325]  And that's not done from a racist perspective or anything.
[00:14:43.345 --> 00:14:45.426]  That's done, you know, from the LaRouche Group.
[00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:47.567]  That's a very diverse and good folks.
[00:14:47.587 --> 00:14:49.468]  That's why the enemy was so scared of them.
[00:14:49.488 --> 00:14:51.450]  And I remember reading that review a long time ago.
[00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.551]  Tell us what's in the review, and then we'll come back and have you speak of it more.
[00:14:55.592 --> 00:14:58.794]  Well, you know, it gets into the history of Bernard Barrett as well.
[00:14:59.895 --> 00:15:02.056]  So, you know, I can see how a lot of people might
[00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:07.759]  I don't get the feeling of anti-Semitism or whatever else you'd like to call it, but, you know, truth is truth.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:20.828]  I don't prescribe to this anti-Jewish rhetoric or whatever else, but there are factions within all of, you know, all of different cultures, you know, that have these extremist groups that align.
[00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:24.050]  And they use the divide-and-conquer tactics.
[00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.131]  They divide us, you know, race.
[00:15:26.191 --> 00:15:28.053]  They divide us on our ideas.
[00:15:29.369 --> 00:15:37.909]  And as you pointed out, it's building to this ultimately dividing conquer tactic that leads to smart city, full on control grid type stuff.
[00:15:39.232 --> 00:15:40.152]  How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?
[00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:16.679]  We're good to go.
[00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:39.772]  Jeffery Emsi didn't kill himself!
[00:16:40.292 --> 00:16:42.252]  Jeffery Emsi didn't kill himself!
[00:16:42.672 --> 00:16:44.593]  Jeffery Emsi didn't kill himself!
[00:16:45.093 --> 00:16:46.633]  Jeffery Emsi didn't kill himself!
[00:16:46.653 --> 00:16:51.435]  And I don't care what Bill Barr says, cause Jeffery Emsi didn't kill himself!
[00:16:51.495 --> 00:16:56.136]  He had a big ol' plane, the Lolita Express.
[00:16:57.276 --> 00:17:00.817]  Padded floors, and no secret service.
[00:17:01.818 --> 00:17:03.318]  But the fans know who flew.
[00:17:12.605 --> 00:17:15.467]  Jeffrey Epstein doesn't kill himself!
[00:17:15.487 --> 00:17:19.429]  Jeffrey Epstein doesn't kill himself!
[00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:23.212]  Well, Bob Mueller got a sweetheart deal!
[00:17:23.472 --> 00:17:31.957]  And Jeffrey Epstein doesn't kill himself!
[00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:40.283]  Christmas lights and drama These things don't make no sense
[00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:51.516]  And I know someone else who didn't hear you say!
[00:17:51.716 --> 00:17:56.281]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.924]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[00:18:04.382 --> 00:18:07.445]  He had a master plan.
[00:18:07.525 --> 00:18:09.367]  For a master race.
[00:18:09.387 --> 00:18:10.868]  Eugenics and Jizzly.
[00:18:10.888 --> 00:18:12.689]  At his New Mexico place.
[00:18:12.709 --> 00:18:14.671]  But we'll never know who.
[00:18:14.691 --> 00:18:15.772]  Cause he didn't kill himself!
[00:18:16.293 --> 00:18:20.196]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[00:18:20.396 --> 00:18:23.158]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[00:18:23.299 --> 00:18:25.420]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.802]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[00:18:27.943 --> 00:18:29.724]  He was a victim of the aggressor!
[00:18:29.964 --> 00:18:30.265]  Jeffrey!
[00:19:03.556 --> 00:19:05.679]  Already our overall number one bestseller.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.989]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price.
[00:19:12.009 --> 00:19:16.335]  Because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[00:19:16.695 --> 00:19:19.519]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.123]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[00:19:22.183 --> 00:19:23.504]  They're getting great responses.
[00:19:23.764 --> 00:19:30.773]  They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does, taken under the tongue, where it's more absorbable.
[00:19:31.053 --> 00:19:35.018]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help
[00:19:35.518 --> 00:19:41.781]  The body produced more energy, helped produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, and so much more.
[00:19:42.221 --> 00:19:48.804]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics already in your body, like vitamin B12.
[00:19:49.064 --> 00:19:57.388]  Whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're black, whether you're white, whether you live in Japan or the United States, Ultra 12 is the best vitamin B12 you're going to find out there.
[00:19:57.408 --> 00:20:01.910]  It's uber absorbable and it's 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:20:05.447 --> 00:20:11.370]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:33.092 --> 00:20:39.414]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:41.315 --> 00:20:46.717]  So those of us that are politically informed see the Southern Providence Law Center, the ADL, CNN, MSNBC.
[00:20:49.795 --> 00:20:58.402]  Saying that Trump's a Nazi, and Stephen Miller's a Nazi, and Alex Jones is a Nazi, and there's Nazis everywhere, and Trump's killing children in cages.
[00:20:58.462 --> 00:20:59.043]  None of it's true.
[00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:00.204]  And we just go, that's insane.
[00:21:00.864 --> 00:21:05.989]  But the average zombie absolutely believes all of that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:06.689 --> 00:21:10.693]  And then the ADL and others go out and give speeches and say, we want to arrest the big tech heads.
[00:21:10.713 --> 00:21:11.553]  They're not doing enough.
[00:21:13.015 --> 00:21:15.357]  We want to just totally shut down Alex Jones.
[00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:19.738]  And we want to purge them.
[00:21:21.499 --> 00:21:22.359]  So there's your headline.
[00:21:22.399 --> 00:21:29.543]  The ADL is working with big tech to spy on Americans for coming purge.
[00:21:31.544 --> 00:21:32.604]  They want to arrest us.
[00:21:32.944 --> 00:21:33.504]  Their words.
[00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:35.465]  They want to imprison us.
[00:21:36.906 --> 00:21:38.627]  They want to take our jobs, our bank accounts.
[00:21:38.947 --> 00:21:40.408]  I mean, this sounds like Hitler.
[00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:44.450]  That's what authoritarians do to groups they're targeting.
[00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.771]  And it's like a bad dream.
[00:21:50.046 --> 00:21:53.969]  I think I've got all these clips that I'd seen last year and this year that I've never even played on air.
[00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:56.251]  Awards ceremonies for the ADL.
[00:21:56.291 --> 00:22:00.154]  Gives awards to Tim Cook for taking me off the internet.
[00:22:01.775 --> 00:22:04.057]  And it's like hour-long speeches about how I'm evil.
[00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:09.101]  They'll go, extremist Nazis and others like Jones.
[00:22:09.121 --> 00:22:10.482]  They go, and others like Jones.
[00:22:11.923 --> 00:22:14.725]  And they've gotten, they've tapped into what I do.
[00:22:14.765 --> 00:22:15.546]  They know who I am.
[00:22:15.586 --> 00:22:16.987]  They know damn well none of that's true.
[00:22:18.348 --> 00:22:24.130]  It's precisely because I don't want division, and I'm a nationalist, that they hate me.
[00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:34.752]  Because people like me, Hispanics, blacks, white, old, young, Asian, Jewish, if you want freedom, I'm all for you.
[00:22:34.792 --> 00:22:36.313]  And I know there's diverse groups in every group.
[00:22:36.413 --> 00:22:44.555]  I refuse to be tricked by the ADL to hate Jews, so the ADL gets more Jews that are scared running up underneath their wings.
[00:22:48.353 --> 00:22:57.460]  This is akin to declassified cases where early on Israel would bomb its own facilities in different parts of the world to get Jews to move to Israel.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.103]  That doesn't mean that I'm against Israel itself, they had different administrations.
[00:23:01.543 --> 00:23:04.165]  Some groups did that, some didn't, just like we've had evil governments here.
[00:23:05.146 --> 00:23:07.587]  LBJ was a really evil guy, Trump I don't think is.
[00:23:09.008 --> 00:23:09.949]  So I'm sophisticated.
[00:23:12.631 --> 00:23:13.392]  But I gotta tell ya,
[00:23:14.557 --> 00:23:19.661]  If you're Jewish, particularly, you need to contact the ADL and tell them they need to stop in your name.
[00:23:20.462 --> 00:23:27.047]  They say they speak for you, saying they want to arrest big tech heads because they're not doing enough, like Mark Zuckerberg, when he's totally censoring everybody.
[00:23:28.468 --> 00:23:29.870]  And that they want to purge people.
[00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:30.570]  These are quotes.
[00:23:32.572 --> 00:23:34.854]  How would you like people saying, purge you?
[00:23:36.095 --> 00:23:41.159]  See, it's Sacha Baron Cohen that goes around saying, throw the Jew down the well so my country can be free.
[00:23:42.304 --> 00:23:43.966]  Hey Sasha, you're not even from the U.S.
[00:23:44.367 --> 00:23:45.608]  Can't my country be free?
[00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.153]  You're free to lie about me and say I'm a Nazi, buddy.
[00:23:49.553 --> 00:23:51.977]  But can't I be on platforms to say you're a liar?
[00:23:52.277 --> 00:23:52.437]  No.
[00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:55.842]  Because Sasha doesn't like to play fair.
[00:23:57.163 --> 00:23:59.066]  Because Sasha is a creepy, evil person.
[00:24:03.083 --> 00:24:03.943]  Let's go back to Casey.
[00:24:03.963 --> 00:24:08.086]  You were bringing up from the LaRouche PAX analysis of the ADL.
[00:24:08.786 --> 00:24:09.946]  And I remember reading that report.
[00:24:09.966 --> 00:24:11.287]  It was like a big, thick magazine.
[00:24:11.647 --> 00:24:13.228]  And everything I remember reading in that turned out to be true.
[00:24:13.248 --> 00:24:14.489]  They locked Lionel LaRouche up.
[00:24:15.369 --> 00:24:20.992]  Because he was a real progressive trying to unify things and trying to have peace with Russia and China and others.
[00:24:21.012 --> 00:24:22.813]  And of course, we never got that, did we?
[00:24:22.833 --> 00:24:26.415]  He just got put in prison for one credit card statement being wrong.
[00:24:26.795 --> 00:24:28.736]  They're trying to put me in prison right now, too.
[00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:32.419]  Yes, sir.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.806]  So I think that every American, everybody in general, needs to look up that particular review there.
[00:24:39.906 --> 00:24:44.771]  Again, it's the Executive Intelligence Review, I believe it's from 1993, and it's called The Ugly Truth About the ADL.
[00:24:45.892 --> 00:24:49.655]  And yeah, I mean, there's a lot in there.
[00:24:49.695 --> 00:24:55.981]  There's a lot that even relates to the Civil War and how groups like this had a hand in causing an uprising in our country before.
[00:24:56.943 --> 00:25:00.765]  So, you know, people need to educate themselves to understand what they're up against.
[00:25:01.305 --> 00:25:08.689]  The other part that I wanted to talk to you about today was the information you can find from Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars.
[00:25:09.469 --> 00:25:10.830]  Lieutenant Colonel Alexander?
[00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:12.350]  I believe so.
[00:25:12.771 --> 00:25:21.015]  And you can find the PDF, you can find the PDF for the Intelligence Review online as much as you can find the Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars PDF.
[00:25:21.055 --> 00:25:23.956]  I suggest everybody download that and really look into it.
[00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:27.032]  Because, you know, they're using this technology.
[00:25:27.052 --> 00:25:32.833]  They're using it in such a way to also... It's not just the propaganda on TV.
[00:25:33.053 --> 00:25:34.553]  We're being wound up in multiple ways.
[00:25:34.613 --> 00:25:38.614]  And I just hope people can take the time to learn about it so they understand again what they're up against.
[00:25:39.614 --> 00:25:40.535]  Very well said, sir.
[00:25:40.595 --> 00:25:41.495]  Thank you so much.
[00:25:44.515 --> 00:25:45.616]  All right, who's up next?
[00:25:49.977 --> 00:25:51.017]  Let's go ahead and...
[00:25:53.715 --> 00:25:54.916]  Talk to Dave in Indiana.
[00:25:54.956 --> 00:25:55.737]  Dave, go ahead, sir.
[00:25:57.858 --> 00:25:58.338]  Hey, Alex.
[00:25:58.399 --> 00:26:02.421]  It's really great to hear that, you know, you're talking about these kinds of issues.
[00:26:03.062 --> 00:26:08.126]  I know it's a very hot-button topic, but I mean, this really is what it comes down to.
[00:26:08.246 --> 00:26:16.832]  Groups like the ADL have been using terms like anti-Semite as a weapon against their enemies.
[00:26:16.932 --> 00:26:20.415]  It used to be that an anti-Semite was someone that hated Jews.
[00:26:21.218 --> 00:26:26.582]  And now it really seems like it's turning into someone that Jews don't like.
[00:26:26.623 --> 00:26:36.491]  They've partnered with D-Lab at the University of California in Berkeley, and they've created this online hate index, which was instrumental in getting your platform taken down.
[00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:45.638]  And they have a long history of collaboration with people like Jewish criminal Meyer Lansky and Moe Dalet.
[00:26:45.658 --> 00:26:48.701]  They actually awarded Moe Dalet the Torches of Liberty Award in 1982.
[00:26:51.051 --> 00:26:56.635]  And it's really, really scary to see what these people are doing.
[00:26:56.995 --> 00:27:01.118]  And there's a guy who's been writing about this for a very long time.
[00:27:01.138 --> 00:27:04.881]  His name is E. Michael Jones, and I think that you need to talk to him.
[00:27:06.542 --> 00:27:07.343]  Well, I know this.
[00:27:07.363 --> 00:27:09.044]  I don't know who E. Michael Jones is.
[00:27:11.973 --> 00:27:18.576]  All I know is I just want to promote freedom, Americana, the Bill of Rights, and I don't try to get into this group or that group.
[00:27:18.616 --> 00:27:30.261]  But when you've got the ADL saying Stephen Miller is a white supremacist and all this crap, fire him in the New York Times, and lying about me and then giving people awards to take me off online.
[00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:33.323]  Now they're saying arrest the big tech heads, purge me.
[00:27:33.643 --> 00:27:34.263]  That's a quote.
[00:27:34.463 --> 00:27:34.963]  Purge!
[00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:35.844]  Purge!
[00:27:36.944 --> 00:27:39.227]  And just smiling like a demon up there.
[00:27:39.247 --> 00:27:40.708]  It's like, what the hell?
[00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:46.614]  I'm an American now cornered by people that want my guns, my kids, everything.
[00:27:46.634 --> 00:27:51.759]  And they insist on labeling me as a Nazi so they can dehumanize me.
[00:27:52.958 --> 00:28:08.955]  And it's just, it's nothing but a supremist organization, a race-based supremacy organization that's literally bullying me and attacking me and then wanting me to attack them so they can say, oh look, Jews, give us money.
[00:28:09.256 --> 00:28:13.880]  Look, see, they don't like you because you're Jewish because this criminal group is representing Jews.
[00:28:13.961 --> 00:28:14.761]  It's disgusting.
[00:28:15.458 --> 00:28:19.460]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center is just as bad, and CNN, all of it.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.421]  But particularly, it's right here in their own documents.
[00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:25.542]  The ADL is at the heart of, and now they want the NRA shut down.
[00:28:25.802 --> 00:28:26.983]  And now they want our bank accounts.
[00:28:27.063 --> 00:28:30.424]  And we have to stand up and say, Hollywood, all of this is insane.
[00:28:30.745 --> 00:28:34.726]  All these TV shows where conservatives are bad and groups go out and kill them.
[00:28:34.766 --> 00:28:37.347]  It's very, very dangerous and it's craziness.
[00:28:37.607 --> 00:28:41.569]  It's crazy megalomania by the ADL and it's not going to end well.
[00:28:41.649 --> 00:28:42.950]  It needs to stop right now.
[00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.091]  Because I'm not scared of the ADL.
[00:28:46.612 --> 00:28:48.272]  I'm scared for the ADL.
[00:28:48.372 --> 00:28:48.993]  I really am.
[00:28:49.373 --> 00:28:51.214]  Because this is extremely dangerous.
[00:28:51.434 --> 00:28:58.718]  And when push comes to shove, ladies and gentlemen, America's not going to roll over like 1917 Russia to take it in a keister.
[00:28:58.918 --> 00:28:59.598]  It's not going to happen.
[00:29:00.078 --> 00:29:00.619]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:00.639 --> 00:29:01.059]  Stay with us.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:13.005]  By now, it has become crystal clear to everyone that our worst, most frightening analysis of the Globalists and who they are and what their endgame is
[00:29:13.866 --> 00:29:17.712]  Was in fact completely true, except it was far worse than we even thought.
[00:29:18.534 --> 00:29:24.503]  So I have to apologize to listeners and viewers that we have really steered you wrong the last 25 years.
[00:29:25.505 --> 00:29:27.468]  That things were far worse than we even thought.
[00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.263]  And if anything, we held back.
[00:29:30.283 --> 00:29:33.707]  We held back because it just sounded too fantastical.
[00:29:33.787 --> 00:29:46.664]  You see, when you're faced with absolute pure evil, and it admits it's evil, and then you think it's going to sound crazy if you tell people, you begin almost aiding the evil by not being completely honest and truthful about what we're facing and what we're dealing with.
[00:29:46.764 --> 00:29:52.147]  Because you want to be comfortable at the dinner table with your family at Thanksgiving because you don't want to ruffle any feathers.
[00:29:52.407 --> 00:29:59.571]  You then create a climate where the globalists can come in and bully and dominate and control and get whatever they want done.
[00:29:59.811 --> 00:30:00.812]  And there are the globalists.
[00:30:00.832 --> 00:30:07.716]  They've got people running around on Black Friday everywhere, running over each other, trampling each other, stabbing each other.
[00:30:07.836 --> 00:30:09.497]  Women in hijabs battling
[00:30:09.497 --> 00:30:09.997]  We're good.
[00:30:29.094 --> 00:30:31.456]  Only get fulfillment through the lottery ticket.
[00:30:31.636 --> 00:30:34.518]  Only get fulfillment through the fake big box store church.
[00:30:34.698 --> 00:30:37.941]  Only get fulfillment by believing in the system, but it's all empty.
[00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:39.502]  There's only a hysteria.
[00:30:39.562 --> 00:30:43.365]  There's only a mad dashing over the edge of a cliff.
[00:30:43.465 --> 00:30:46.727]  But on this Black Friday, I want to challenge the listeners.
[00:30:46.887 --> 00:30:48.449]  I want to challenge the viewers.
[00:30:48.649 --> 00:30:52.712]  I want to challenge people to understand how fundamental it is
[00:30:53.644 --> 00:31:10.238]  When you have that relationship with God, when you open up that channel of free will, saying, I want to be in touch with the real creator, the real master, God, not the fallen system, not the fallen entities, not all the space junk, but the real deal, that's the most important thing.
[00:31:12.174 --> 00:31:19.418]  Opening channels up to others who are depressed, who are down, who are beaten down by the system that have been told that they're worthless when they're so incredible.
[00:31:19.598 --> 00:31:26.781]  And then spreading the word about outlets and institutions that the enemy and the world wants to silence by InfoWars.com.
[00:31:26.881 --> 00:31:29.963]  And then financially support the broadcast, which is so easy.
[00:31:30.083 --> 00:31:34.565]  So you notice what funds us is t-shirts that spread the word and that help you meet like-minded people.
[00:31:35.105 --> 00:31:37.446]  It's literally a uniform to wear your colors proud.
[00:31:37.466 --> 00:31:39.227]  It can also get you assaulted, get you attacked.
[00:31:39.307 --> 00:31:40.307]  It's powerful.
[00:31:40.347 --> 00:31:42.488]  The water filters we sell are the very best out there.
[00:31:42.568 --> 00:31:45.149]  Help your body cut out the toxins, give you good water.
[00:31:45.169 --> 00:31:47.790]  Funds the operation, the air filtration, same system.
[00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:55.033]  The non-GMO heirloom seeds that regenerate life basically eternally over and over again as long as someone gathers the seeds and plants them again.
[00:31:55.053 --> 00:31:58.435]  The supplements, the krill oil, that's the very best krill oil you're gonna find.
[00:31:58.615 --> 00:31:59.475]  Super high quality.
[00:31:59.495 --> 00:32:04.477]  What it does for your body, for your cardiovascular, for your brain, for your cells, for your blood, for your hair, for
[00:32:04.577 --> 00:32:04.677]  Yeah.
[00:32:28.609 --> 00:32:38.056]  High realms, the quiet place, the most high that King David talked about, where you can see for trillions of miles and have deep understanding so great, you almost forget the world you're in.
[00:32:38.177 --> 00:32:40.298]  You have to go back into the matrix to save others.
[00:32:40.438 --> 00:32:41.980]  That's what these products do.
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.142]  They literally fund our operation itself.
[00:32:45.522 --> 00:32:45.963]  Incredible.
[00:32:46.323 --> 00:32:52.408]  But, help you regenerate, help you be more focused, help you be more healthy, are two forms of toothpaste.
[00:32:53.154 --> 00:32:54.174]  Three different types total.
[00:32:54.635 --> 00:32:56.876]  Fluoride-free, coiled silver, iodine-fortified.
[00:32:57.316 --> 00:32:58.836]  And now the new whitening toothpaste.
[00:32:58.956 --> 00:33:00.057]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:33:00.077 --> 00:33:00.877]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:33:00.937 --> 00:33:01.697]  It is Black Friday.
[00:33:01.738 --> 00:33:02.578]  Triple Patriot Points.
[00:33:02.598 --> 00:33:03.338]  Biggest sales ever.
[00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:11.301]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.835 --> 00:33:27.823]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:40.418]  Well, Zach Voorhees has been called by other engineers that have gone public, the biggest whistleblower ever from Google.
[00:33:42.108 --> 00:33:52.880]  And I remember when he was here, I don't know, three, four months ago, he was getting into the fact that the ADL is right at the heart of the censorship push, actually inside Google spying on what you do.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.965]  And they got caught breaking in police stations back in the 80s and 90s and got in a lot of trouble.
[00:33:57.985 --> 00:34:01.669]  They lost a bunch of big $10 million lawsuits, calling people Nazis that weren't.
[00:34:02.837 --> 00:34:16.686]  But now, through puppet organizations and things, they've basically launched this whole big push to call Trump a Nazi, myself a Nazi, to produce all these TV shows and movies, like The Hunt, or now The Hunters, where you hunt down the Trump supporters and kill them because they're all Nazis.
[00:34:18.207 --> 00:34:25.251]  I mean, the Nazis were loser, weirdo, crazy people, and that were from Germany and got their ass kicked by America.
[00:34:25.511 --> 00:34:28.894]  I'm not accepting this identity the ADL's putting on me.
[00:34:30.551 --> 00:34:33.633]  And in groveling on the ground here, I'm a classical liberal.
[00:34:34.734 --> 00:34:35.855]  That doesn't mean a modern liberal.
[00:34:36.395 --> 00:34:37.396]  I believe in America.
[00:34:37.716 --> 00:34:39.457]  And so Zach Voorhees is here with us.
[00:34:40.538 --> 00:34:43.960]  He heard me talking about this and said, hey, I'm trying to get to town a month ago.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:44.401]  He couldn't do it.
[00:34:44.421 --> 00:34:46.762]  He said, hey, I'd like to come to town now and speak about this.
[00:34:46.782 --> 00:34:47.483]  We have loaded phones.
[00:34:47.503 --> 00:34:50.825]  We'll take your calls right into the fourth hour as well today.
[00:34:50.865 --> 00:34:53.387]  But you have to understand something.
[00:34:54.292 --> 00:34:57.313]  He, Sacha Baron Cohen admittedly was reading off a teleprompter.
[00:34:57.373 --> 00:34:58.813]  These are things the ADL has said.
[00:34:58.933 --> 00:34:59.954]  It's also what's in the documents.
[00:35:00.014 --> 00:35:10.837]  But to have him saying, last Thursday, I didn't learn about it until Friday, at their big event, that we're going to arrest the big six tech heads if they don't do exactly what we say, he tells them.
[00:35:10.857 --> 00:35:13.758]  I mean, it's very authoritarian.
[00:35:14.818 --> 00:35:15.819]  People overuse Hitler.
[00:35:15.919 --> 00:35:17.099]  This was very Hitlerian.
[00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:18.619]  You're going to do what we say or we're going to arrest you.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:23.181]  And then he went on to say we're going to purge off the internet
[00:35:24.155 --> 00:35:32.418]  These people, and he said Trump, he said Breitbart, Alex Jones, and then they're in the New York Times that very day saying, purge Stephen Miller.
[00:35:32.898 --> 00:35:33.999]  He's a white supremacist.
[00:35:34.019 --> 00:35:34.719]  Give me a break.
[00:35:35.319 --> 00:35:39.961]  He's a conservative Jewish guy that loves America, and he's trying to unify us around America.
[00:35:40.361 --> 00:35:45.763]  So it really is like the ADL really goes after Prager and Miller, Jews that don't.
[00:35:46.603 --> 00:35:51.127]  I guess nationalists or right-wing Jews, great people, also seem to be folks they don't like.
[00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:53.809]  I know they don't like Levin and others on Fox.
[00:35:54.669 --> 00:35:56.991]  So everybody knows I'm not against Jews.
[00:35:57.412 --> 00:35:58.212]  Jews are diverse groups.
[00:35:58.232 --> 00:36:06.579]  But the ADL is a very nasty organization, again, founded to protect the pedophile, and founded to protect the Jewish mafia.
[00:36:07.159 --> 00:36:09.281]  And they've made it their mission to, quote, purge me.
[00:36:09.761 --> 00:36:20.830]  So they're saying, purge me, that means destroy me, pogrom, like Hitler did to Jews, and I'm just like, I'm sorry, I'm not going to play the part of Hitler, and I'm not here for you to destroy me, just because you're, you know, Hillary lost.
[00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:22.391]  So, Zach, thanks for joining us.
[00:36:22.591 --> 00:36:24.533]  Thank you, Alex, for having me back on your show.
[00:36:24.813 --> 00:36:26.995]  So what do you make of this massive escalation?
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.681]  Well, I saw this coming a long time ago.
[00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:45.266]  I saw that Google had partnered with the ADL in order to create an online hate index where they would go through and identify all the different places on the internet that were contributing to hateful speech.
[00:36:45.746 --> 00:36:50.847]  And, you know, what they think is hateful speech are things like 9-11 Truths.
[00:36:51.367 --> 00:36:55.909]  They think that white rights are, you know, places where hate fosters.
[00:36:56.249 --> 00:37:00.773]  And so... If you say, no, I'm not inherently bad because I'm white, they call that hate.
[00:37:01.394 --> 00:37:01.574]  Right.
[00:37:01.614 --> 00:37:03.736]  Well, they say... I mean, they're literally saying white people are bad.
[00:37:03.756 --> 00:37:08.400]  I mean, look at the campaign of It's OK to be White.
[00:37:08.681 --> 00:37:12.084]  And they're saying we've got to get rid of this dangerous, like, heat speech.
[00:37:12.144 --> 00:37:12.664]  And it's just like...
[00:37:13.912 --> 00:37:17.954]  Being okay to be white is your classification of hate speech?
[00:37:17.974 --> 00:37:19.595]  What do you call yourself, like a classical liberal?
[00:37:19.615 --> 00:37:24.397]  I mean, liberals are like for speech, and everybody's good, and you don't judge people by their race.
[00:37:24.477 --> 00:37:28.179]  They're saying, no, no, no, white Anglo-Saxons are the devil!
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.340]  Well, BS, you damn Nazi!
[00:37:30.641 --> 00:37:33.802]  That's Nazi-like to say a group is inherently bad!
[00:37:34.463 --> 00:37:35.303]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:35.363 --> 00:37:36.944]  Geez, I mean, what the hell's going on here?
[00:37:39.008 --> 00:37:44.754]  I mean, you know, they're saying that there's a bunch of neo-Nazis that are in America and that they're about to rise up.
[00:37:44.814 --> 00:37:48.017]  Like, let me just paint about how ridiculous this is.
[00:37:48.117 --> 00:37:53.442]  Think if Putin was saying we need to stop the neo-Confederate movement in Russia, right?
[00:37:53.762 --> 00:37:57.846]  Like, you think Russia might be, you know, taken over by neo-Confederates?
[00:37:58.587 --> 00:38:05.053]  And this is what they're trying to say in America, is that we're going to be taken over by neo-Nazis.
[00:38:05.474 --> 00:38:12.300]  That a German political party, a century ago, is on the verge of taking over America.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:17.345]  And it's just like, I've seen these signs in San Francisco that have been warning about this neo-Nazi takeover.
[00:38:17.385 --> 00:38:18.266]  Where are these people?
[00:38:18.726 --> 00:38:23.589]  Well, what happens is when you get to university, you're 18, they literally scare you and go, there's Nazis on campus.
[00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:26.450]  They did it to Candace Owens to make you scared, to put you into a cult.
[00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:27.510]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:38:27.651 --> 00:38:30.012]  It's just fear and division that they're trying.
[00:38:30.072 --> 00:38:35.655]  And there's Sacha Baron Cohen up there reading off the teleprompter and it says behind him, you know, never is now, so never again.
[00:38:35.675 --> 00:38:40.557]  They're saying the Holocaust is now, yeah, of American rights at the hands of the ADL.
[00:38:40.817 --> 00:38:41.618]  Yes, it's true!
[00:38:41.838 --> 00:38:43.399]  You're the Nazis, I'm the Jew!
[00:38:43.639 --> 00:38:45.700]  Leave me the hell alone, you crazy people!
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.201]  Stop calling Stephen Miller a Nazi!
[00:38:48.221 --> 00:38:49.262]  Stop calling Trump one!
[00:38:49.442 --> 00:38:50.543]  You crazy loons!
[00:38:50.783 --> 00:38:52.004]  You evil, evil people!
[00:38:52.225 --> 00:38:53.546]  What the hell is your problem?
[00:38:53.966 --> 00:38:54.807]  That's insane!
[00:38:56.411 --> 00:39:02.914]  You know, whenever they talk about Holocaust denial, I always wonder, are they talking about the Armenian Holocaust, which the ADL denied until, like, 2016?
[00:39:03.414 --> 00:39:05.315]  Are they talking about the Haldimor?
[00:39:05.715 --> 00:39:09.237]  Nobody serious denies that Hitler didn't kill a bunch of Jews and was bad.
[00:39:09.817 --> 00:39:10.818]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:39:10.998 --> 00:39:11.498]  What the hell?
[00:39:11.538 --> 00:39:13.119]  We beat the frickin' Nazis!
[00:39:13.419 --> 00:39:15.860]  Stop calling me a Nazi, you dirty liars!
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.621]  God, I'm getting pissed, man.
[00:39:18.959 --> 00:39:23.122]  And I saw one of these guys going, oh, Jones' grandfather's almost dying in World War II.
[00:39:23.282 --> 00:39:26.264]  He was like, just denying America went to war in World War II.
[00:39:26.584 --> 00:39:27.385]  You're the deniers!
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:28.320]  Yeah.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.300]  Alex, can I trigger you, actually?
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.701]  I've got a video I want to show.
[00:39:31.741 --> 00:39:34.061]  You're denying that America kicked the Nazis' ass!
[00:39:34.421 --> 00:39:34.781]  You!
[00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:37.362]  You live in the past because you love Hitler!
[00:39:37.522 --> 00:39:38.982]  You love the attention it gets you!
[00:39:39.002 --> 00:39:39.362]  Go ahead.
[00:39:40.262 --> 00:39:46.583]  I would love to trigger you with a video that was pushed by the ADL talking about the online hate index.
[00:39:47.163 --> 00:39:51.964]  And this is clearly illustrative of what they want to do to the Internet.
[00:39:52.324 --> 00:39:54.225]  We're going to get to that clip next segment, I promise.
[00:39:54.245 --> 00:39:56.165]  But I want to play these first, okay?
[00:39:56.385 --> 00:39:56.605]  Okay.
[00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:57.506]  I know you got a bunch of stuff.
[00:39:57.526 --> 00:39:58.547]  I haven't seen what you're going to play.
[00:39:58.567 --> 00:39:58.868]  I don't know.
[00:39:58.908 --> 00:39:59.969]  I'm not going to pre-approve it.
[00:39:59.989 --> 00:40:01.891]  I just want to get to my clips because we'll never get to them.
[00:40:02.391 --> 00:40:05.895]  Here is Sacha Baron Cohen reading off a teleprompter saying, Purge.
[00:40:05.955 --> 00:40:06.816]  Let's play the Purge clip.
[00:40:07.776 --> 00:40:10.297]  There is such a thing as objective truth.
[00:40:10.697 --> 00:40:12.797]  Facts do exist.
[00:40:13.457 --> 00:40:20.619]  And if these internet companies really want to make a difference, they should hire enough monitors to actually monitor.
[00:40:21.139 --> 00:40:25.100]  Work closely with groups like the ADL and the NAACP.
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:31.302]  Insist on facts and purge these lies and conspiracies from their platforms.
[00:40:31.502 --> 00:40:38.825]  By the way, NewsGuard has hired the ADL and they're allowed to go into your private accounts, when you have accounts with Microsoft, and read what you're saying.
[00:40:38.865 --> 00:40:39.466]  They admit this.
[00:40:39.666 --> 00:40:41.446]  So the ADL is in your computer!
[00:40:41.887 --> 00:40:46.629]  Hell, who needs the NSA when you've got Sacha Baron Cohen in there making sure you're a good person?
[00:40:46.869 --> 00:40:47.749]  Let's go to the next clip.
[00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.792]  Here he is saying, arrest the big tech heads if they don't fully submit to him.
[00:40:53.092 --> 00:40:55.753]  So hiring a bunch of ADL to run things isn't enough.
[00:40:55.993 --> 00:40:56.413]  Here it is.
[00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:59.755]  And maybe fines are not enough.
[00:41:00.678 --> 00:41:11.822]  Maybe it's time to tell Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of these companies, you already allowed one foreign power to interfere in our elections.
[00:41:11.842 --> 00:41:12.162]  That's not true.
[00:41:12.582 --> 00:41:16.644]  You already facilitated one genocide in Myanmar.
[00:41:17.084 --> 00:41:19.105]  Do it again and you go to jail.
[00:41:20.629 --> 00:41:22.051]  Fondizes again, Israel.
[00:41:22.291 --> 00:41:22.932]  You go to jail.
[00:41:22.992 --> 00:41:24.194]  It's the same BS.
[00:41:24.254 --> 00:41:25.055]  Blaming Big Tech.
[00:41:25.335 --> 00:41:27.198]  Big Tech under Hillary launched the Arab Spring.
[00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:36.310]  Let's play a little bit of the awards ceremony of the ADL last December with Tim Cook with him going, oh, thanks for getting Alex Jones, who's such a hero.
[00:41:36.791 --> 00:41:37.532]  Purge him!
[00:41:37.592 --> 00:41:37.972]  Here, here.
[00:41:39.701 --> 00:41:49.824]  He uses ambiguous terms and phrases, like good judgment and the innate desire to separate right from wrong, without actually giving right and wrong any clear definition.
[00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:55.725]  My friends, if we can't be clear on moral questions like these, then we've got big problems.
[00:41:55.905 --> 00:41:56.746]  Sure, Tim.
[00:41:56.906 --> 00:42:03.948]  Clarity is absolutely needed for us to understand why you think viewpoint discrimination is actually a good thing.
[00:42:04.028 --> 00:42:08.509]  The trouble is, every time we ask you, you give unclear answers like this one.
[00:42:08.669 --> 00:42:09.089]  Why?
[00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.211]  Because it's the right thing to do.
[00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:14.414]  It's the same type of answer you gave that vice reporter, too.
[00:42:14.434 --> 00:42:17.797]  But at what point were you like, okay, that's it, Alex Jones has to go?
[00:42:18.017 --> 00:42:29.166]  You know, I don't want to get into a singular kind of event, but I think there's enough there that reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate,
[00:42:30.684 --> 00:42:31.624]  That should be all.
[00:42:31.704 --> 00:42:36.166]  You know, reasonable people who understand the difference between right and wrong.
[00:42:36.206 --> 00:42:46.049]  The trouble is, every single injustice committed in human history was done by people who viewed themselves as reasonable in pursuit of a greater good.
[00:42:46.169 --> 00:42:52.411]  Take your pick in the lottery of human injustice, from the communist breadlines to the fascist concentration camps.
[00:42:52.451 --> 00:42:57.272]  The people behind these atrocities believed they were good and reasonable.
[00:42:57.452 --> 00:42:59.132]  It has been an incredible journey for InfoWars in the last four years.
[00:42:59.173 --> 00:43:01.753]  And it's been a journey that I have been honored and privileged to be a part of.
[00:43:22.054 --> 00:43:29.839]  And I was thinking about how far it's come since 2016 in the election of President Trump to where we are now.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:51.053]  And I'm just thinking about the impact, the censorship, all the news that we've uncovered years before everybody else, but also knowing the threat that free speech is under and knowing the threat that InfoWars has right now by the globalists, by the Democrats, by the deep state, by Hollywood, by all these people that want us off air.
[00:43:52.334 --> 00:43:58.659]  And so I was kind of thinking, how can I get the audience to understand this on a personal level?
[00:44:00.206 --> 00:44:14.821]  And I realized that if you just look at where InfoWars was at 2015 to 16, and now 2019 to 20, we can take a look at where InfoWars was and is, and where it should be going or can be going.
[00:44:14.941 --> 00:44:18.044]  So, what did InfoWars do in 2015 and 2016 that was so important?
[00:44:18.084 --> 00:44:19.746]  Well, the story is, in 2016, that was the moment
[00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:38.623]  That Infowars, this audience, Alex Jones, our team of reporters were pretty much solidified in American history and were pretty much certified as now the most powerful and influential name in news.
[00:44:38.923 --> 00:44:48.872]  And before they could pretend like it didn't exist, before they could just cast us off, before they could just ignore us and demonize us, but then in 2016 we got Trump elected.
[00:44:49.172 --> 00:44:51.014]  This audience, this platform.
[00:44:51.394 --> 00:44:53.615]  Literally, the one I'm standing on right here.
[00:44:54.455 --> 00:45:00.136]  Because if you flash back the clocks, folks, you'll remember, most Fox News hosts, if not all of them, were not pro-Trump.
[00:45:00.236 --> 00:45:08.079]  The average conservative out there that's selling Trump gear, or the average conservative ink person that's stumping for Trump now, was not a Trump supporter back then.
[00:45:08.219 --> 00:45:11.319]  Because the Republican Party didn't want Trump, the mainstream news didn't want Trump.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.020]  So it was this audience,
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:23.143]  It was the people that share these links, the people that tune in, the people that call in, the people that are red-pilled, the people that are quote-unquote woke to the government corruption, knew it came from both sides.
[00:45:23.243 --> 00:45:24.143]  We got Trump elected.
[00:45:24.183 --> 00:45:28.284]  That solidified InfoWars as influential, effective, and victorious.
[00:45:28.584 --> 00:45:33.546]  And so this sent the Democrats, the mainstream media, the globalists into a total panic.
[00:45:33.806 --> 00:45:37.547]  And that's why they've thus tried to keep InfoWars off of all platforms.
[00:45:37.607 --> 00:45:45.830]  But you see, 2016 was the demarcation line where InfoWars was influential, successful, and there is nothing they can do about it except shut us down.
[00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:48.571]  So that's where InfoWars was at, had a victory.
[00:45:48.771 --> 00:45:50.492]  Now InfoWars is at a different point.
[00:45:50.592 --> 00:45:55.294]  We've already solidified ourselves as influential, impactful, moving into the future.
[00:45:55.494 --> 00:46:00.977]  Now, the next challenge is to solidify ourselves as bigger than the establishment.
[00:46:01.177 --> 00:46:03.458]  Free speech, bigger than the establishment.
[00:46:03.518 --> 00:46:05.919]  The truth, bigger than the establishment.
[00:46:06.219 --> 00:46:10.241]  And that's literally only possible with your support at Infowarsstore.com because
[00:46:10.461 --> 00:46:18.547]  Just like, can we get Trump over the hump and the Republican nomination so that he can beat Hillary Clinton with InfoWars and this audience pushing him to the finish line?
[00:46:18.648 --> 00:46:19.568]  The answer was yes.
[00:46:19.808 --> 00:46:29.976]  Now the question is, can InfoWars survive as a news organization with all the lawsuits, the demonization, the lies, the attacks, the censorship?
[00:46:30.817 --> 00:46:38.119]  Can we survive and still be on air and expand and be more effective than ever despite all the attacks they have against us?
[00:46:38.159 --> 00:46:42.341]  So, just like we had a victory in 2016, give us a victory in 2020.
[00:46:42.441 --> 00:46:46.122]  Keep InfoWars on the air by taking advantage of the Black Friday specials, folks.
[00:46:46.162 --> 00:46:47.102]  We make it easy.
[00:46:47.262 --> 00:46:55.665]  Triple Patriot points so that we can hire the next Owen Schroer, the next Kaitlyn Bennett, the next Millie Weaver, just like in 2016 when I was hired.
[00:46:55.785 --> 00:46:57.746]  Who will be the next star that you make possible in 2020?
[00:47:05.245 --> 00:47:09.358]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:09.859 --> 00:47:11.183]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:25.279 --> 00:47:28.842]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:47:29.342 --> 00:47:30.783]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.803 --> 00:47:35.906]  All right, I know we've got loaded phones with James and Chase and Carlos and Andy and Jefferson and Phil and Dee.
[00:47:35.926 --> 00:47:44.572]  We'll get to all of you pretty quick, and then we'll get into all these clips and the analysis that Zach Voorhees is really smart, former Google insider, is going to lay out for us.
[00:47:44.612 --> 00:47:52.238]  But the reason this is so big is the ADL is right at the center of big tech inside, interfaced.
[00:47:53.378 --> 00:47:54.039]  That's confirmed.
[00:47:54.219 --> 00:47:55.640]  That's not a deny.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.101]  Spying on what you're doing.
[00:47:57.161 --> 00:47:58.802]  And Microsoft has hired them and others.
[00:48:00.163 --> 00:48:02.985]  And it'd be one thing if they were spying on Nazis illegally.
[00:48:03.025 --> 00:48:04.306]  That'd be illegal and I'd be against it.
[00:48:04.666 --> 00:48:07.208]  They're doing it to everybody and then calling us Nazis.
[00:48:08.249 --> 00:48:09.370]  And it's so dangerous.
[00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:10.310]  It's so crazy.
[00:48:10.371 --> 00:48:12.032]  And it's going to piss a lot of people off.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:27.034]  And I've let it run down my back like a duck when they do all of this, but I want to go back to the clip with that reporter breaking down last December, I never even talked about this at the time, when the ADL gave an award to Tim Cook for censoring yours truly.
[00:48:27.254 --> 00:48:28.295]  Let's play a few more minutes of that.
[00:48:29.449 --> 00:48:29.970]  I think?
[00:48:45.985 --> 00:48:55.669]  Yes, that ADL gave Tim Cook recognition for his fantastic and supposedly humanitarian work against the fundamental human right of free speech.
[00:48:55.749 --> 00:48:57.270]  But Apple's a private company.
[00:48:57.330 --> 00:48:58.570]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.
[00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.451]  I'm not saying Apple must host InfoWars.
[00:49:01.651 --> 00:49:07.134]  I'm just saying I don't accept the idea that censorship efforts are moral, virtuous, or heroic.
[00:49:07.274 --> 00:49:10.375]  Anyway, this thing is called the Courage Against Hate Award.
[00:49:10.675 --> 00:49:12.816]  The first of its kind from the ADL.
[00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:21.358]  Though I'm surprised they didn't give themselves the award for their own courage against hate, disabling the ratings and comments on the video of the presentation.
[00:49:21.498 --> 00:49:29.420]  ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt introduces Tim Cook, specifically praising him for banning Alex Jones off of Apple platforms.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:39.083]  Apple was the first company to remove Alex Jones' hateful, anti-government, conspiratorial rants from their platform.
[00:49:42.236 --> 00:49:44.337]  As well as standing up to racism.
[00:49:44.417 --> 00:49:50.682]  When he saw racism, he told his employees that he would not stand for it.
[00:49:51.402 --> 00:49:54.584]  Racism does not represent our values, he said.
[00:49:54.704 --> 00:49:58.507]  Discrimination based on race doesn't represent our values.
[00:49:58.787 --> 00:50:01.989]  We much prefer discrimination based on viewpoint.
[00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:05.992]  Tim has advocated for equal treatment for all.
[00:50:06.092 --> 00:50:12.096]  Yeah, except for Alex Jones, who doesn't count in the definition of all, because we disagree with him.
[00:50:12.256 --> 00:50:22.243]  I'm incredibly excited about our next speaker, who I know will not only add spark to our conversation, I am certain he will inspire us.
[00:50:22.383 --> 00:50:23.164]  Well, thank God.
[00:50:23.224 --> 00:50:28.667]  If there's one person who could actually make Tim Cook look like an exciting spark, it's this dude.
[00:50:28.747 --> 00:50:32.150]  The major quote from Tim that's getting a lot of play is this one.
[00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:39.715]  He says that his company has a moral obligation to combat so-called hate, and to ignore that obligation would be sinful.
[00:50:39.895 --> 00:50:53.208]  I believe the most sacred thing that each of us is given is our judgment, our morality, our own innate desire to separate right from wrong.
[00:50:54.853 --> 00:51:00.815]  Choosing to set that responsibility aside at a moment of trial is a sin.
[00:51:01.035 --> 00:51:06.517]  Setting aside the implied idea that political censorship is righteous, I disagree fully.
[00:51:06.837 --> 00:51:14.380]  I think that efforts to silence viewpoints you don't like are one of the most fundamentally unjust aggressions you can take against your fellow man.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.260]  But beyond that,
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:22.802]  What's frustrating is Tim Cook has no coherent explanation for what this moral imperative he's describing actually means.
[00:51:22.882 --> 00:51:29.823]  He just uses ambiguous terms and phrases like good judgment and the innate desire to separate right from wrong.
[00:51:29.843 --> 00:51:30.844]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:51:30.964 --> 00:51:40.066]  I'm really impressed, and I meant to get this guy on, I learned about him over two years ago, Matt Christensen, and he wasn't even going to be a public speaker until he was going to Evergreen College.
[00:51:40.686 --> 00:51:48.811]  And he just saw the incredible brainwashing and tyranny, and they were teaching that whites were inherently of the devil, and he's a white liberal, and he's like, that's really racist and crazy.
[00:51:48.991 --> 00:51:57.956]  I mean, it's the hijacking of true liberalism, Thomas Jefferson ideas that the authoritarian left fears and wants to get rid of.
[00:51:58.597 --> 00:51:59.838]  It's simply insane.
[00:51:59.858 --> 00:52:02.159]  So I'm gonna get back to our guest and your calls.
[00:52:02.259 --> 00:52:03.260]  It's just that Tim Cook
[00:52:04.451 --> 00:52:12.534]  The Communist Party of China, going back five years ago, would say, if you just pay people a dollar a day more, they won't have their kids living on the street.
[00:52:13.474 --> 00:52:18.616]  They'd chain them up to power poles outside Foxconn, and they won't have suicide nets and 18-hour workdays.
[00:52:18.636 --> 00:52:23.238]  Just pay them a dollar a day more, and we'll give you a better contract.
[00:52:23.358 --> 00:52:26.179]  So the Communists asked Apple to be nicer, and they said no.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:33.202]  So I said, you know, just because Tim Cook lives and is gay, doesn't mean he gets to be a monster.
[00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:37.021]  He's all about the moralness.
[00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:41.727]  Oh, the most sacred thing is the moralness.
[00:52:43.088 --> 00:52:44.810]  I don't care that Tim Cooks likes guys.
[00:52:45.371 --> 00:52:51.899]  It's that the fake actor, because he has sex with dudes, now he can run death camps in China and go to the ADL and get sickening awards.
[00:52:51.919 --> 00:52:52.500]  That's what I'm getting at.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.101]  Yeah, I completely agree.
[00:52:55.148 --> 00:53:02.210]  Like, um, he's coming in there and saying that they're going to de-platform a certain group based upon their identitarianism.
[00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:04.731]  And, uh, people are applauding that.
[00:53:05.351 --> 00:53:08.292]  And it's just like, how can they not see that this is a Trojan horse?
[00:53:08.792 --> 00:53:10.293]  Like, they ban you, Alex.
[00:53:10.933 --> 00:53:11.593]  Who else is gonna be banned?
[00:53:11.653 --> 00:53:12.693]  And now, that was a year ago.
[00:53:12.794 --> 00:53:13.294]  It's everywhere.
[00:53:13.514 --> 00:53:14.014]  Now it's everywhere.
[00:53:15.222 --> 00:53:17.863]  I just don't know how Trump and them go, oh, it's a private company.
[00:53:17.883 --> 00:53:19.003]  That was a year ago's argument.
[00:53:19.063 --> 00:53:19.463]  It's not.
[00:53:19.804 --> 00:53:26.186]  It's organized groups coming in in combines, bullying and harassing and deplatforming people, and then getting them fired from their jobs.
[00:53:26.546 --> 00:53:31.788]  I mean, Michelle Malkin said she supports free speech on campuses, so she was fired by her right-wing group.
[00:53:32.028 --> 00:53:34.329]  And then they called her a white supremacist.
[00:53:34.669 --> 00:53:36.589]  She's an Asian woman married to a Jew.
[00:53:36.869 --> 00:53:37.890]  This is insane!
[00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:41.393]  Yeah, the slandering people that aren't even white is white supremacists.
[00:53:42.074 --> 00:53:44.136]  And it's just... All because they go, white people aren't bad.
[00:53:44.616 --> 00:53:46.698]  Yeah, or we should have the freedom of speech.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.324]  And you were saying this was a few years ago inside Google what pissed you off, was just seeing clear racism by the left.
[00:53:53.725 --> 00:53:54.526]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:54.586 --> 00:54:01.913]  Like, they're implementing racist hiring practices in order to just try to create an equitable state in the company.
[00:54:03.237 --> 00:54:04.578]  Like, how is that not communism?
[00:54:04.898 --> 00:54:09.242]  And, you know, we should be hiring people by their merits and by their skill.
[00:54:09.402 --> 00:54:11.344]  We should not have race as a factor.
[00:54:11.364 --> 00:54:12.184]  Well, that's what I do.
[00:54:12.244 --> 00:54:12.905]  I don't need to be told.
[00:54:12.925 --> 00:54:14.406]  I mean, I hire whoever does a good job.
[00:54:14.966 --> 00:54:16.488]  Right, because you're a decent American.
[00:54:17.388 --> 00:54:20.251]  Well, just because I want to run things well, I don't even think about what color they are.
[00:54:20.331 --> 00:54:20.591]  Yeah.
[00:54:20.871 --> 00:54:22.412]  And you know, the thing is... That's the thing about the left, though.
[00:54:22.472 --> 00:54:23.353]  All they see is color.
[00:54:24.034 --> 00:54:24.154]  Yeah.
[00:54:25.333 --> 00:54:25.653]  They do.
[00:54:26.154 --> 00:54:36.345]  I mean, you know, they would make Martin Luther King turn in his grave, where we're now judging people based on the color of their skin and not the content of their character.
[00:54:36.365 --> 00:54:40.609]  And now they're saying, purge those that don't submit to us, arrest the heads of big tech.
[00:54:40.669 --> 00:54:42.812]  I mean, this is flaming authoritarianism.
[00:54:43.112 --> 00:54:44.574]  Why do you think they're getting to this point?
[00:54:45.587 --> 00:54:49.530]  Um, honestly, I think that they're trying to... I think it's a coup.
[00:54:49.911 --> 00:54:53.493]  I honestly think... I mean, I was in, you know, Google, I didn't... Over all of America.
[00:54:53.854 --> 00:54:54.414]  I mean, that's it.
[00:54:54.654 --> 00:54:57.917]  We're gonna put you in jail, we're gonna take your speech, we're gonna take your property.
[00:54:57.957 --> 00:54:59.638]  I mean, that's... that's concentration camps.
[00:54:59.858 --> 00:55:03.862]  Right, like, political correctness always precedes, like, a mass genocide.
[00:55:03.902 --> 00:55:05.603]  Like, you see it in Russia, you see it in China.
[00:55:05.643 --> 00:55:08.205]  Oh yeah, leftists have killed roughly ten times what right-wingers have.
[00:55:08.345 --> 00:55:09.186]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:55:09.206 --> 00:55:10.007]  So this is what they do.
[00:55:10.067 --> 00:55:11.008]  They're following a formula.
[00:55:11.028 --> 00:55:12.029]  They intend to lock us up.
[00:55:12.149 --> 00:55:21.760]  Which is why we need to oppose this with every living fiber of our body and reverse it because the thing is is that you think that it's coming in to like protect a minority class.
[00:55:21.820 --> 00:55:22.862]  No, it's a Trojan horse.
[00:55:23.362 --> 00:55:27.164]  For implementing a genocidal-like regime that's going to come in.
[00:55:27.244 --> 00:55:38.549]  Because if you can't talk and say, you know, the things that are really on your mind, then what they're going to do is they're going to take away your livelihood, they're going to deplatform you, and then they're going to... But I mean, it's blowing up in their face.
[00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:41.711]  Why call Trump a Nazi?
[00:55:41.771 --> 00:55:42.571]  It's not true!
[00:55:42.591 --> 00:55:44.592]  And people know that's not true.
[00:55:44.933 --> 00:55:47.894]  They need to stop Trump because of what's happening with Epstein.
[00:55:48.694 --> 00:55:49.335]  That's what I think.
[00:55:50.273 --> 00:55:59.419]  I think that when Epstein comes out that the full nature of what he was doing to blackmail politicians, influencers, celebrities.
[00:55:59.779 --> 00:56:05.322]  Well the ADL was started when a guy was kidnapping kids and delivering them around and killed a 13 year old girl.
[00:56:05.522 --> 00:56:05.763]  Yeah.
[00:56:05.943 --> 00:56:08.404]  So that's the specialty from the start has been to cover up.
[00:56:08.424 --> 00:56:10.626]  They formed in order to protect this criminal.
[00:56:11.366 --> 00:56:23.290]  And I'm noticing right now that Barry Krischer, the guy who got Jeffrey Epstein off from Sex with Minors and Prostitution, he was given the ADL's Jury Prudence Award.
[00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:26.670]  And it's just like, why are they covering for this prosecutor?
[00:56:26.690 --> 00:56:30.932]  Well, what's happening is the ADL's been sitting back with the Southern Poverty Law Center on the left and seeing what they can get away with.
[00:56:30.952 --> 00:56:35.833]  And they've gotten away with so much, and all this bullying, that they think they can now say, we're going to arrest everybody.
[00:56:36.253 --> 00:56:37.814]  And I'm just sorry, that's not going to happen.
[00:56:39.417 --> 00:56:40.998]  Yeah, I mean, we're not going to let them.
[00:56:41.018 --> 00:56:41.799]  Well, you know what the next move is?
[00:56:41.819 --> 00:56:43.080]  They're going to false flag themselves.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.121]  Yeah.
[00:56:45.482 --> 00:56:47.723]  Yeah, that's their game plan.
[00:56:47.763 --> 00:56:48.464]  That's the game plan.
[00:56:48.924 --> 00:56:49.124]  Yeah.
[00:56:49.525 --> 00:56:55.729]  And they don't want me on air when it happens, because they want to... I just, you know, I just can't believe it.
[00:56:55.869 --> 00:56:57.931]  I just cannot believe the country's come to this.
[00:56:59.724 --> 00:57:08.847]  I mean, the good thing is that, you know, if someone's pushing a projected consensus, then the way to break the spell is to just, you just need a minority of people to say the truth.
[00:57:08.867 --> 00:57:13.649]  To call it out and say this is, that's why they want to solve error, is because the lie can't be challenged by the truth.
[00:57:14.249 --> 00:57:14.449]  Right.
[00:57:14.609 --> 00:57:15.629]  It has to be unopposed.
[00:57:15.889 --> 00:57:19.130]  You can't have anybody else actually pushing out the truth because the truth is viral.
[00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:21.931]  Well, it's like them saying men can have babies and all this.
[00:57:21.991 --> 00:57:23.692]  It's meant to make you just accept.
[00:57:24.432 --> 00:57:33.579]  And then an Asian woman who's pro-Israel, married to a Jew, says, I believe campuses should have free speech, and she's fired and called a Nazi by conservative groups.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.341]  That is crazy town!
[00:57:36.362 --> 00:57:46.069]  And it's going to have the byproduct of making a bunch of people turn into what the ADL is saying they are, which is what the ADL wants, because then when there's pushback to Jews in general, all that money will float into the ADL.
[00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:50.793]  The ADL is setting Jews up for persecution, just like they did in World War II.
[00:57:50.833 --> 00:57:51.554]  They worked with Hitler.
[00:57:53.797 --> 00:58:01.060]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins, ingratiating goblins, in bed with a goblin.
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:10.483]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins, succubus with goblins, ingratiating goblins, in bed with a goblin.
[00:58:10.503 --> 00:58:16.545]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins, ingratiating goblins, in bed with a goblin.
[00:58:16.565 --> 00:58:20.707]  I don't want to see him kissing goblins, ingratiating goblins,
[00:58:25.757 --> 00:58:27.219]  I'm not expecting him to not get dirty.
[00:59:34.844 --> 01:00:00.644]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:13.830]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:17.151]  I know you can see me, so here's a surprise.
[01:00:17.171 --> 01:00:21.472]  I promise I'm going to James, Chase, Carlos, Jefferson, Andy, Phillip, Dee.
[01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:22.952]  The number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-Alex.
[01:00:22.972 --> 01:00:25.792]  Zach Voorhees is with us a little bit in the next hour, as we got over an hour and 15 minutes
[01:00:34.534 --> 01:00:37.457]  We have our next guest host taking over, Phil Cilente.
[01:00:37.477 --> 01:00:39.279]  He'll be able to get his presentation.
[01:00:39.319 --> 01:00:40.640]  He's got it ready at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:41.761]  And I promise to go to your calls.
[01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:43.002]  It's all on this subject.
[01:00:43.462 --> 01:00:44.964]  So let's go to that right now.
[01:00:45.004 --> 01:00:45.885]  We were just talking during the break.
[01:00:46.783 --> 01:00:51.267]  Whether it's this new globalist pope saying open your borders up or you're evil and go into hell, or whether it's the ADL.
[01:00:51.687 --> 01:00:54.729]  These are all just puppet groups for this satanic force behind it.
[01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:56.351]  You said, yeah, it's cult wars.
[01:00:56.691 --> 01:00:59.533]  That's really what it is, all these cults at the top battling for power.
[01:01:00.074 --> 01:01:00.894]  Right, exactly.
[01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:08.641]  And groups of people, you know, with an ideology that's false and they just like, you know, and they're all controlled by a satanic elite.
[01:01:08.821 --> 01:01:09.661]  Putin called this out.
[01:01:09.681 --> 01:01:11.563]  He said the new world order worships Satan.
[01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:12.324]  He did.
[01:01:13.585 --> 01:01:13.865]  He did.
[01:01:13.905 --> 01:01:14.805]  That's why they hate Putin.
[01:01:14.865 --> 01:01:16.066]  James in North Carolina.
[01:01:16.366 --> 01:01:16.826]  You're on the air.
[01:01:16.866 --> 01:01:17.386]  Thanks for holding.
[01:01:20.466 --> 01:01:21.307]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[01:01:21.587 --> 01:01:21.967]  Good, sir.
[01:01:22.027 --> 01:01:22.647]  Thank you for holding.
[01:01:22.807 --> 01:01:23.707]  What's your view on all this?
[01:01:25.147 --> 01:01:26.908]  Um, well, yeah.
[01:01:27.408 --> 01:01:29.048]  Cult war is exactly what it is.
[01:01:30.509 --> 01:01:33.469]  Whether it's communism, socialism, whatever you want to call it.
[01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:35.470]  Just anti-American.
[01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:39.230]  The more and more you look at it, McCarthy was right.
[01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.291]  You know?
[01:01:41.351 --> 01:01:42.311]  Ultimately, that's what it is.
[01:01:44.062 --> 01:01:53.346]  And what it is is people that are too Machiavelli, they don't stand for something, so they just are into all this craziness and always fighting with each other for power, instead of just building, and then you have power.
[01:01:53.366 --> 01:01:56.288]  I mean, that's really what this is, just mental sickness.
[01:01:56.868 --> 01:01:58.008]  It's insanity is what it is.
[01:01:59.929 --> 01:02:07.132]  Yeah, and what's sad now, nowadays, is the mentally weak that are usually the ones that benefit from being so smart.
[01:02:07.673 --> 01:02:08.433]  Look at AOC.
[01:02:08.773 --> 01:02:10.634]  I mean, it's just obvious.
[01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:20.650]  Yeah, and AOC was an actor, an actress, and she was brought on by a group that was looking for people to run in New York.
[01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:32.419]  And the company that, you know, hired her admitted in a documentary that they had done this, and that she was just someone that they pulled out through a whole filtering process, and they injected her into... A literal puppet!
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:33.460]  A literal puppet.
[01:02:34.221 --> 01:02:35.342]  Yeah, with an audition.
[01:02:35.882 --> 01:02:36.563]  That's AOC.
[01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.167]  Yeah, there's things you don't hear on other news that
[01:02:41.826 --> 01:02:42.607]  You only hear here.
[01:02:42.647 --> 01:02:46.171]  That's the reason I've been listening for the past 10 years.
[01:02:46.251 --> 01:02:49.014]  And I'll tell somebody, Hey, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:02:49.054 --> 01:02:50.235]  Oh, that conspiracy theorist.
[01:02:50.275 --> 01:02:54.880]  And I'm like, you know, the CIA invented that so people wouldn't question what's really going on.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.284]  And I mean, that's the reason I'm such an ardent fan.
[01:02:58.344 --> 01:03:01.367]  And, you know, I don't really care what anybody thinks, because
[01:03:02.833 --> 01:03:03.954]  The truth will come to light.
[01:03:04.095 --> 01:03:07.399]  I mean, it says it in the good books, so I think we should all take heed to it, you know?
[01:03:07.979 --> 01:03:09.481]  Thank you so much, James, for holding.
[01:03:10.503 --> 01:03:13.026]  I don't want to make it about me, but it is.
[01:03:13.346 --> 01:03:14.628]  And we'll go to break and make more calls.
[01:03:14.728 --> 01:03:17.712]  Why do you think the system is so obsessed with this show?
[01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:21.418]  The thing is, is that you're talking about the truth.
[01:03:21.858 --> 01:03:27.721]  And the thing is, is that Jeffrey Epstein's about to be exposed as an intelligence front that was blackmailing people.
[01:03:27.741 --> 01:03:32.764]  And the thing is, is that if there's anyone that's American first, they're going to be talking about that.
[01:03:32.944 --> 01:03:45.151]  And so the thing is, is that they're making a big push right now to get rid of people like you and other channels because they want to shut down the damaging information that's about to come out.
[01:03:45.711 --> 01:03:46.192]  That's why.
[01:03:47.193 --> 01:03:51.455]  What do you think about William Barr coming out and saying, perfect storm, Epstein killed himself?
[01:03:51.515 --> 01:03:52.455]  That is so discrediting.
[01:03:52.835 --> 01:03:53.316]  Yeah, I know.
[01:03:53.476 --> 01:03:57.057]  I mean, I think personally that Epstein was negotiated out of there.
[01:03:57.277 --> 01:04:00.619]  I mean, if he's an intelligence operative, then they're going to want to get him out.
[01:04:00.699 --> 01:04:13.944]  I don't really... I mean, I've confirmed with folks that knew who he was and worked around him that he was triple agents, CIA, MI6, and Mossad, and that they were all... and it was a very high level group where those all nest together.
[01:04:13.984 --> 01:04:14.684]  That's how those work.
[01:04:15.104 --> 01:04:16.165]  And so he was very high level.
[01:04:16.505 --> 01:04:17.926]  Yeah, extremely high level.
[01:04:18.186 --> 01:04:20.708]  And the thing is, is that he didn't kill himself.
[01:04:21.288 --> 01:04:23.430]  He was either killed or he was transferred out of prison.
[01:04:23.570 --> 01:04:26.392]  And I think that he's probably living in some island right now.
[01:04:26.432 --> 01:04:28.013]  Well, that's what Pchenik said.
[01:04:28.053 --> 01:04:30.655]  Pchenik really did run major black op operations.
[01:04:31.195 --> 01:04:32.716]  I mean, overthrowing governments and stuff.
[01:04:32.756 --> 01:04:33.737]  He says he's alive.
[01:04:34.097 --> 01:04:34.797]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:04:35.558 --> 01:04:36.639]  And Pchenik's Jewish, so...
[01:04:38.137 --> 01:04:40.399]  You can't make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:40.599 --> 01:04:42.100]  It's just absolutely insane.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.803]  I just want justice and freedom and American values.
[01:04:44.883 --> 01:04:46.004]  I don't want race wars.
[01:04:46.084 --> 01:04:50.768]  I don't want Hollywood with dozens of movies about killing white people and just forcing us into a fight.
[01:04:50.908 --> 01:04:51.508]  Forcing us.
[01:04:52.329 --> 01:04:53.430]  It's just, it's horrible.
[01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:55.211]  We'll be back in 60 seconds with Zach Voorhees.
[01:04:55.652 --> 01:04:59.795]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[01:05:06.593 --> 01:05:08.013]  Dude, America FIRST!
[01:05:08.073 --> 01:05:09.074]  America FIRST!
[01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:10.574]  Get that through your head!
[01:05:10.614 --> 01:05:12.014]  Dude, America FIRST!
[01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:13.075]  America FIRST!
[01:05:13.295 --> 01:05:14.435]  You heard that before?
[01:05:14.615 --> 01:05:14.815]  What?
[01:05:15.055 --> 01:05:16.016]  America FIRST!
[01:05:16.076 --> 01:05:17.056]  America FIRST!
[01:05:17.116 --> 01:05:18.496]  What the hell, man?
[01:05:18.616 --> 01:05:19.997]  Dude, America FIRST!
[01:05:20.077 --> 01:05:21.037]  America FIRST!
[01:05:21.097 --> 01:05:22.677]  To all of you, let me explain one damn thing.
[01:05:23.037 --> 01:05:24.498]  America, America, America.
[01:05:24.578 --> 01:05:26.878]  Dude, you understand?
[01:05:27.059 --> 01:05:28.919]  America, America, America.
[01:05:28.939 --> 01:05:30.539]  My point is, America's first.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.420]  America, America, America.
[01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.053]  Bubbles, no!
[01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:37.054]  Goblins, no!
[01:05:37.134 --> 01:05:37.635]  This is it.
[01:05:37.956 --> 01:05:38.977]  Everybody get ready!
[01:05:39.057 --> 01:05:39.959]  America First!
[01:05:40.059 --> 01:05:40.860]  America First!
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:42.963]  Just get that through your head, dude!
[01:05:43.043 --> 01:05:43.985]  America First!
[01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.066]  America First!
[01:05:45.127 --> 01:05:46.388]  You heard that before?
[01:05:46.408 --> 01:05:46.609]  What?
[01:05:46.629 --> 01:05:47.450]  America First!
[01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:48.432]  America First!
[01:06:26.278 --> 01:06:30.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.962]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:33.002 --> 01:06:35.243]  So, America is a powerful nation.
[01:06:35.703 --> 01:06:38.225]  The New Atlantis, the technological elite.
[01:06:39.385 --> 01:06:43.107]  And because we have morals compared to other countries, we've had incredible wealth.
[01:06:43.948 --> 01:06:47.330]  So, because we have morals, corrupt groups come in and they manipulate us.
[01:06:48.598 --> 01:06:56.360]  Through our morals, to hate ourselves, and then go to them, the moral authority, the leftists, to let them tell us how to live our lives, hand our children over to them, and submit.
[01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:59.953]  Zach Voorhees is a big Google whistleblower.
[01:06:59.993 --> 01:07:00.654]  He's here with us.
[01:07:01.854 --> 01:07:02.975]  And I want to go back to calls.
[01:07:03.015 --> 01:07:04.435]  Bottom of the hour, we'll get into your presentation.
[01:07:04.455 --> 01:07:07.457]  But before we go to calls, spend a few minutes on... I mean, we're not just saying this.
[01:07:07.517 --> 01:07:13.920]  It's on record that the ADL is inside Big Tech with Google, in people's accounts, spying on everyone.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:14.800]  This is all admitted.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:16.121]  It's an outrageous scandal.
[01:07:16.881 --> 01:07:20.063]  They also work with Microsoft and NewsGuard.
[01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:22.291]  I don't think so.
[01:07:37.674 --> 01:07:43.176]  Trying to get rid of Section 230 and bringing these folks on board with the Southern Poverty Law Center and other globalist organizations.
[01:07:43.616 --> 01:07:44.296]  Very dangerous.
[01:07:44.757 --> 01:07:51.179]  Yeah, you know, and the thing is that the ADL is actually proud that they're trying to censor the whole internet.
[01:07:51.199 --> 01:07:52.019]  They brag about it.
[01:07:52.059 --> 01:07:59.542]  The video that I'm going to show later on is going to show them in their own words talking about how they're going to censor the internet and where all the hate speech is.
[01:08:00.002 --> 01:08:03.884]  The ADL is a libel and defamation laundering operation.
[01:08:04.404 --> 01:08:19.289]  They take conspiracy theories against people that they don't like, and they flood them in and legitimize them, like against you Alex, and then they make their way into the Wikipedia, and then that becomes, um, you know, a stand-in for fact and truth.
[01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:26.672]  And then what happens is- That's right, they write the script that the media then picks up and then defames you with, and then they call- and then they say, you're defaming them.
[01:08:26.932 --> 01:08:38.719]  Yeah, and the important pillar here is that it is Wikipedia that Google is using to give a secret page rank score to every website on the Internet.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:47.465]  And so what the ADL says about you will be what Wikipedia says about you, and then from there you will get your website pushed down.
[01:08:47.865 --> 01:08:49.306]  This isn't a conspiracy theory.
[01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.547]  This is something that Google has admitted.
[01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:55.469]  And then they go to the group called G2 in Boston that's really CIA.
[01:08:56.630 --> 01:09:02.233]  And then, when the ADL says that, and it's put on Wikipedia, that's seen as fact, and then they downrank your credit.
[01:09:02.594 --> 01:09:04.975]  I have my credit score, it's perfect for business.
[01:09:05.295 --> 01:09:13.120]  But then it says hate, and so it goes down into the red, so then you don't get credit, you don't get merchant accounts.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.142]  I mean, this is literally what Hitler did when he got power.
[01:09:16.656 --> 01:09:20.658]  He had a social credit system for the... Well, he wouldn't let Jews do commerce.
[01:09:21.238 --> 01:09:22.198]  He boarded up their businesses.
[01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:25.540]  And so now I've done nothing, and I'm being persecuted like this.
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:30.682]  Literally, the ADL's outside my business painting, you know, I guess a Christian, and I'm a Christian there, or I'm an American.
[01:09:30.702 --> 01:09:34.284]  They're putting A on it, and they got literal jackboots just smashing my windows out.
[01:09:34.944 --> 01:09:39.447]  Can you tell me more about sort of the social credit thing that you've been marked down for?
[01:09:39.527 --> 01:09:51.035]  Yeah, you know, we've been getting a lawsuit ready on it and things, and I mean, it's a secret credit score that the banks have, that the ADL runs through a group called G2 in Boston.
[01:09:51.715 --> 01:09:52.016]  Wow!
[01:09:52.216 --> 01:09:54.897]  Oh yeah, and all Americans are having it put on them.
[01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:55.718]  They don't even know it.
[01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:56.979]  How'd you find out about it?
[01:09:58.511 --> 01:10:03.434]  Well, all these documents have digital hashes in them, hidden codes, but the banks are very scared.
[01:10:03.454 --> 01:10:04.995]  I was given, three banks gave it to me.
[01:10:05.615 --> 01:10:05.856]  Yeah.
[01:10:05.876 --> 01:10:06.736]  And it's been authenticated.
[01:10:06.776 --> 01:10:07.497]  It's criminal.
[01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:10.919]  Yeah, and the thing is, is that they're trying to sneak in the social credit system.
[01:10:10.939 --> 01:10:12.359]  And the banks are very upset about it too.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:13.120]  Are they?
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.841]  I mean, they understand, oh my God, are you kidding?
[01:10:14.861 --> 01:10:15.921]  I mean, this is very dangerous.
[01:10:16.502 --> 01:10:18.723]  I literally had an A put on me.
[01:10:19.243 --> 01:10:22.125]  I mean, I literally wear a digital A put there by the ADL on me.
[01:10:22.465 --> 01:10:22.705]  Yeah.
[01:10:22.926 --> 01:10:25.347]  And if they had their way, I'll be put in prison and have my guts kicked out.
[01:10:25.367 --> 01:10:27.668]  And it doesn't matter, like, what race you are.
[01:10:27.688 --> 01:10:28.829]  I mean, look at Laura Loomer.
[01:10:28.949 --> 01:10:39.234]  Like, she's Jewish, and the thing is, is that she's been slandered as a... Well, what she is, is she's a nationalist patriot and loves America, and she gets in leftist faces and is effective.
[01:10:39.854 --> 01:10:44.136]  And what I found is the ADL particularly hates conservative nationalist Jews.
[01:10:44.337 --> 01:10:45.017]  Look at Stephen Miller.
[01:10:45.297 --> 01:10:46.097]  Yeah.
[01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:47.018]  They literally want him fired.
[01:10:48.038 --> 01:10:49.159]  They call him a white nationalist.
[01:10:49.179 --> 01:10:49.959]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:51.200]  Or Prager.
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:51.940]  Dennis Prager.
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:53.220]  Look at what's happening to him.
[01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:56.302]  He's getting his... Because the ADL thinks they own Jews.
[01:10:56.702 --> 01:10:56.982]  Yeah.
[01:10:57.582 --> 01:11:01.564]  And they have to reinforce it with this Holocaust narrative that keeps on going.
[01:11:01.584 --> 01:11:03.504]  And, you know, the Holocaust did happen.
[01:11:03.584 --> 01:11:03.964]  Absolutely.
[01:11:03.984 --> 01:11:05.845]  I don't want to, like, get my words, like, mixed up.
[01:11:05.885 --> 01:11:15.409]  But the thing is, is that they use this to reinforce whatever justification they want to be able to... And it's like I have nothing to do with what Hitler did.
[01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:18.330]  I'm just sitting here and then you're acting like Hitler to me.
[01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:19.770]  I'm a human being.
[01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:24.092]  Head of the ADL, Rosenblatt, I'm a human being.
[01:11:24.112 --> 01:11:29.554]  And then you sit there and talk about how humane you are when you persecute people like this.
[01:11:30.834 --> 01:11:31.374]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:31.695 --> 01:11:32.235]  It's criminal.
[01:11:33.375 --> 01:11:34.235]  It's just crazy.
[01:11:34.315 --> 01:11:35.296]  I mean, I've literally...
[01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.749]  It's crazy, Joe.
[01:11:37.069 --> 01:11:38.310]  I mean, it's an extortion racket.
[01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:41.071]  Like, the ADL comes to you and says, hey, we're writing some bad stuff.
[01:11:41.091 --> 01:11:42.072]  Do you want this to go away?
[01:11:42.112 --> 01:11:45.813]  How about you make a donation to our organization?
[01:11:46.034 --> 01:11:51.156]  Like, that happened with YouTube's largest video producer, PewDiePie.
[01:11:51.596 --> 01:11:57.941]  You know, and he ended up, you know, capitulating, and then, you know, saying, I'm going to donate $50,000 to the ADL.
[01:11:58.341 --> 01:12:00.623]  But something amazing happened when that happened.
[01:12:00.823 --> 01:12:02.184]  The whole internet said, why?
[01:12:02.264 --> 01:12:02.925]  What are you doing?
[01:12:03.045 --> 01:12:12.432]  And it was such a commotion, because now it's known that the ADL is this slandering operation, that PewDiePie did the amazing step of retracting his $50,000.
[01:12:12.572 --> 01:12:18.177]  I saw that, but then I was watching one of his videos, and he's like, and did the ADL try to help?
[01:12:18.848 --> 01:12:21.090]  It was the whole one about which one of these hate symbols has been banned.
[01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.851]  The answer is all three.
[01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:26.715]  I just think, I mean, imagine being the ADL, though, where you don't actually go after real Nazis.
[01:12:27.036 --> 01:12:28.557]  You go around terrorizing people.
[01:12:29.198 --> 01:12:29.398]  Yeah.
[01:12:30.099 --> 01:12:31.700]  Yeah, and trying to extort them for money.
[01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.041]  Let's go to a phone call here.
[01:12:33.061 --> 01:12:36.805]  Gotta go to who's been holding the longest.
[01:12:37.305 --> 01:12:38.487]  Dee, thanks for holding, Dee.
[01:12:38.507 --> 01:12:39.487]  You're on the air from Virginia.
[01:12:40.869 --> 01:12:41.369]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:43.031]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:55.143]  I have an idea, and I'll talk fast because I'm fascinated by your host and I know other people are waiting, but for your 360 win, I have another layer for that if people are interested.
[01:12:55.524 --> 01:12:58.568]  I know that all the Info Warriors are really generous giving people.
[01:12:59.509 --> 01:13:00.469]  We're good to go.
[01:13:17.117 --> 01:13:30.328]  And take, say, a $100, $200 InfoWars gift certificate and bring it to the nonprofit organization who can utilize wonderful InfoWars products in giving it to the people that they're helping.
[01:13:30.788 --> 01:13:38.774]  Oh my gosh, I never even talk about how we have those little gift certificates, and then they also come to InfoWars, so in the process you're waking them up when people go to redeem it.
[01:13:38.814 --> 01:13:39.475]  That's a great idea.
[01:13:40.475 --> 01:13:44.978]  Yeah, and also, you know, like, yeah, they become aware of InfoWars.
[01:13:45.058 --> 01:14:05.672]  And then to the side, which is also important to people in this economic, you know, situation that some of us are in, that when the nonprofit receives a gift, they usually write a letter to the person who's giving it to them, acknowledging a tax-deductible gift, a donation to the nonprofit.
[01:14:06.232 --> 01:14:10.155]  So if it all works like one, two, three, four, everybody wins.
[01:14:11.445 --> 01:14:12.766]  See, that's a beautiful idea.
[01:14:12.826 --> 01:14:14.267]  Thank you so much for that great idea.
[01:14:14.388 --> 01:14:22.675]  Anything you want to add about the massive purge of free speech and the ADL saying they want to arrest Mark Zuckerberg and the heads of Big Tech if they don't submit to them?
[01:14:24.256 --> 01:14:27.259]  I am thrilled that you are bringing all that information to us.
[01:14:27.279 --> 01:14:31.482]  I agree with everything you said and Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[01:14:33.354 --> 01:14:37.516]  You know, their attempt to cover up Epstein has blown up spectacularly.
[01:14:37.536 --> 01:14:41.718]  And have they figured out yet that this isn't communist China with no history of ever having freedom?
[01:14:42.418 --> 01:14:44.880]  Or Russia that was under Tsarist before didn't really have any freedom?
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.781]  So one tyranny could take over from the other?
[01:14:47.601 --> 01:14:49.182]  Don't they get it's not going to go the way they think?
[01:14:49.922 --> 01:14:53.624]  I think they still think that they've got control over the people's minds in America.
[01:14:53.684 --> 01:14:57.926]  What's, you know, being obviously clear is that they don't have that anymore.
[01:14:58.386 --> 01:15:00.468]  And the thing is, is that people are waking up.
[01:15:00.568 --> 01:15:02.148]  We're going through this great awakening.
[01:15:02.609 --> 01:15:08.071]  And now all of a sudden, we're able to push back against this and say, no, you guys are the fascists.
[01:15:08.532 --> 01:15:09.132]  It's not us.
[01:15:09.692 --> 01:15:10.032]  OK?
[01:15:10.893 --> 01:15:12.654]  I mean, I literally love everybody.
[01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:13.522]  Yeah.
[01:15:13.562 --> 01:15:13.662]  Yeah.
[01:15:31.363 --> 01:15:33.904]  But then everybody knows everybody's trying to get in this country, and that's not true.
[01:15:34.484 --> 01:15:40.786]  Yeah, and they're trying to flood... I mean, the ADL is instrumental in trying to flood the immigrants, open immigration, into the United States.
[01:15:40.866 --> 01:15:41.686]  It's a democide.
[01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:44.827]  They want to change the United States and turn it into a socialist country.
[01:15:44.847 --> 01:15:45.287]  Oh, yeah.
[01:15:45.747 --> 01:15:51.209]  Sacha Baron Cohen, reading her teleprompter message, says there's a big lie about replacement migration.
[01:15:51.249 --> 01:15:52.369]  That's a UN document.
[01:15:52.389 --> 01:15:52.689]  Yeah.
[01:15:52.929 --> 01:15:54.390]  He says that's a lie and doesn't exist.
[01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:56.190]  Well, more calls, and we're going to get to your presentation.
[01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:57.231]  We've got a lot coming up.
[01:15:57.331 --> 01:15:58.331]  Zach Voorhees is our guest.
[01:15:58.351 --> 01:15:58.671]  Stay with us.
[01:16:03.206 --> 01:16:05.385]  How did you kill Jeffrey Epstein?
[01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:18.011]  We're good to go.
[01:16:39.485 --> 01:16:56.188]  He had a big ol' plane The Lolita Express Padded floors And no secret service But the feds know who flew That's why he didn't kill himself
[01:17:12.182 --> 01:17:13.887]  We're good.
[01:17:35.964 --> 01:17:36.965]  Christmas lights and drywall.
[01:17:37.005 --> 01:17:38.887]  These things don't hate themselves.
[01:17:38.947 --> 01:17:40.008]  Christmas lights and drywall.
[01:17:40.188 --> 01:17:41.770]  These things don't hate themselves.
[01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:43.491]  And I know someone else who didn't hate himself!
[01:17:43.531 --> 01:17:44.692]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:17:44.812 --> 01:17:46.374]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:17:46.394 --> 01:17:48.716]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:17:48.816 --> 01:17:56.303]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:17:56.343 --> 01:18:00.768]  Was that one question?
[01:18:04.967 --> 01:18:08.229]  He had a master plan for a master race.
[01:18:08.269 --> 01:18:11.191]  Eugenics and Jizz Lane at his New Mexico place.
[01:18:11.211 --> 01:18:14.772]  But we'll never know who, cause he didn't kill himself.
[01:18:14.792 --> 01:18:15.993]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:18:16.834 --> 01:18:21.176]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:18:21.656 --> 01:18:25.558]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:18:25.658 --> 01:18:28.320]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:30.241]  He was a victim of the Edison!
[01:18:30.541 --> 01:18:32.022]  Jeffrey Epstein!
[01:19:03.311 --> 01:19:05.432]  My God, you're not going to get our guns.
[01:19:05.492 --> 01:19:08.153]  By the way, bud, more guns means less crime.
[01:19:08.173 --> 01:19:09.294]  But I want to say this right here.
[01:19:09.334 --> 01:19:10.834]  You will not take my right.
[01:19:10.854 --> 01:19:12.455]  The knife doesn't kill people.
[01:19:12.475 --> 01:19:14.136]  The gun doesn't kill people.
[01:19:14.176 --> 01:19:16.657]  Because there's criminals, I don't lose my rights here.
[01:19:16.917 --> 01:19:18.598]  The guns didn't do it.
[01:19:18.938 --> 01:19:19.818]  The tyrants did it.
[01:19:19.858 --> 01:19:20.779]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:19:20.899 --> 01:19:21.979]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:19:22.179 --> 01:19:23.140]  Mao took the guns.
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.000]  Chavez took the guns.
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:29.482]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[01:20:04.856 --> 01:20:10.738]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.066 --> 01:20:48.207]  I know that I don't understand The way my feelings grow I've got to look outside again
[01:21:08.126 --> 01:21:10.147]  We're back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:21:10.927 --> 01:21:12.148]  Here's some of the breaking news.
[01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:16.249]  Go ahead and tell folks why they've had Prince Andrew move out of the palace.
[01:21:16.409 --> 01:21:30.274]  Yeah, so today, right now on TheDailyMail.com, Prince Andrew's friend Ghislaine Maxwell is set to come out of hiding and speak to the FBI about her connection to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:21:31.034 --> 01:21:37.247]  And we've got Obama administration under investigation criminally for Biden involvement with Ukraine Energy Company.
[01:21:37.648 --> 01:21:38.029]  Congress?
[01:21:39.124 --> 01:21:44.586]  Probing potential fraud, money laundering, 2016 election meddling by Ukraine officials and Democrats.
[01:21:44.626 --> 01:21:46.427]  Jamie White, Infowars.com.
[01:21:47.187 --> 01:21:47.947]  Big report.
[01:21:48.388 --> 01:21:56.831]  Also, Paris feminists attack other protesters for highlighting studies showing 52% of male rapists are migrants.
[01:21:56.851 --> 01:21:59.112]  We're going to play that video coming up.
[01:21:59.192 --> 01:22:03.734]  DHS deputies, 60,000 migrants sent back under Remain in Mexico program.
[01:22:04.714 --> 01:22:05.955]  Thank you very much Alex, Mr. Voorhees.
[01:22:05.995 --> 01:22:07.736]  Basically, you brought up the point that
[01:22:32.672 --> 01:22:39.297]  I was going to talk to you about the ADL, if I have a chance I will, but I'd like to tell you something about the Epstein case.
[01:22:39.618 --> 01:22:46.583]  The Epstein case is going to blow and blow and blow, because it was an intelligence operation, Alex.
[01:22:47.083 --> 01:23:00.854]  It was essentially a honey trap ran directly by the Prime Minister of Israel, going back to Maxwell, and all the way back to the 1990s.
[01:23:03.308 --> 01:23:04.029]  I think so.
[01:23:22.862 --> 01:23:26.588]  And that's why, that's why Ehud Olmert, I'm going from memory, he got caught visiting Epstein in New York as well.
[01:23:37.503 --> 01:23:37.643]  Right.
[01:23:57.302 --> 01:23:58.223]  Let me ask you this.
[01:23:58.243 --> 01:24:00.346]  Why do they want Benjamin Netanyahu out so bad?
[01:24:19.482 --> 01:24:20.903]  Well, there it is.
[01:24:21.984 --> 01:24:34.094]  People don't realize that Ehud Barak started a political party about a year and a half ago, before the elections, actually because he saw the opportunity of settling peace with the Palestinians, which he had started with Clinton.
[01:24:34.694 --> 01:24:40.719]  And when Ehud Barak began this political party, seeing that Netanyahu wouldn't be able to do so,
[01:24:41.596 --> 01:24:44.418]  And President Trump was coming in with a deal of the century.
[01:24:44.738 --> 01:24:46.360]  He tried to set up a political party.
[01:24:46.700 --> 01:25:00.250]  At this point, Durrett and Barak have said this, that Netanyahu probably was behind the release of those photographs involving Epstein, was to discredit him so that he wouldn't have a chance to get re-elected.
[01:25:00.611 --> 01:25:07.516]  Now, as it stands right now, President Trump has given so much to Israel with regards to the deal of the century.
[01:25:07.896 --> 01:25:08.156]  I think so.
[01:25:26.078 --> 01:25:28.920]  Sure, so Ehud Barak was the handler of Epstein.
[01:25:28.980 --> 01:25:29.740]  That's all come out.
[01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.042]  Yes, I've covered this like 13 years ago.
[01:25:32.722 --> 01:25:37.145]  My point is, is that who do you see as the factions then battling in all of this?
[01:25:37.205 --> 01:25:41.267]  And why does the ADL think taking me off the air is going to stop it coming out?
[01:25:41.587 --> 01:25:43.328]  All it's going to do is make me cover it more now.
[01:25:43.348 --> 01:25:45.590]  And they just put me right on this channel.
[01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:47.351]  Oh, here, you want me on that channel 24-7?
[01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:49.212]  Here, attack me and try to destroy me.
[01:25:49.252 --> 01:25:51.033]  Here, I'll just go 100% attack.
[01:25:51.053 --> 01:25:52.254]  I mean, what the hell are they thinking?
[01:25:52.654 --> 01:25:58.078]  Yeah, which is why I'm here to amplify this message about what's going on because we are taking back America!
[01:25:58.739 --> 01:26:01.681]  I'm just sick of people trying to destroy me and my family for no damn reason.
[01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:03.603]  Calling me a frickin' Nazi for nothing.
[01:26:03.823 --> 01:26:04.023]  Yeah.
[01:26:04.043 --> 01:26:06.465]  I haven't done jack crap to these people, man.
[01:26:06.886 --> 01:26:07.146]  Yeah.
[01:26:08.807 --> 01:26:09.788]  Alex, the ADL?
[01:26:10.689 --> 01:26:10.869]  Yes.
[01:26:11.806 --> 01:26:28.108]  When they talk, listen, President Trump had better be very, very careful because the Red Terror, this is in history, this is documented, the Red Terror is coming to America and he better watch out because if he doesn't begin to address it, he will be facing
[01:26:28.753 --> 01:26:35.575]  He's re-elected, of course, and there's every indication that he may not be, for many reasons.
[01:26:35.615 --> 01:26:36.695]  We won't go into that today.
[01:26:37.055 --> 01:26:41.656]  But the point is that if he doesn't watch out, this has happened before.
[01:26:41.976 --> 01:26:49.558]  You just have to talk to people like Putin, who knows all about the Red Terror and how it was instigated, and how other people suffered because of it.
[01:26:52.293 --> 01:26:58.837]  I know this, I don't care if you're German or Chinese or Jewish or old or young, you don't want a Red Terran in America.
[01:26:58.857 --> 01:27:02.579]  And I guarantee you, the globalists, the leftists, are openly pushing it.
[01:27:02.599 --> 01:27:06.642]  They have all these TV shows and movies about violent uprisings and how they're going to kill everybody.
[01:27:06.902 --> 01:27:08.023]  This is psychotic!
[01:27:08.583 --> 01:27:09.644]  This is psychotic!
[01:27:09.784 --> 01:27:10.584]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:10.604 --> 01:27:11.225]  You want to comment on that?
[01:27:11.485 --> 01:27:21.830]  I mean, they're trying to prep us for what's going to happen, and they're trying to institute it, but they're not going to succeed, because right now, political correctness is ending throughout the country.
[01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:31.514]  People are ripping off the mask, and that freedom of speech is trying to be restored, which is why the ADL is trying to combat that.
[01:27:32.174 --> 01:27:42.522]  And trying to censor people, because the political correctness is just melting, the chains are breaking free, and the true information and history is now emerging again.
[01:27:42.542 --> 01:27:53.992]  I just don't know what the ADL thinks, or the Southern Poverty Law Center, or these crazy universities that the attendance at all these universities is going down like 50% the last five years with the brainwashing.
[01:27:55.053 --> 01:27:56.974]  Hollywood's collapsing, the NFL's collapsing.
[01:27:57.334 --> 01:27:57.995]  Don't they know?
[01:27:58.175 --> 01:27:59.276]  People are running from this!
[01:27:59.336 --> 01:28:00.197]  We're sick of it!
[01:28:00.717 --> 01:28:06.000]  Yeah, well, they don't care about money as much as they care about control.
[01:28:06.460 --> 01:28:09.461]  And this is the thing, because I was in Google, and I was like, why are they doing this?
[01:28:09.561 --> 01:28:14.183]  Why are they censoring people to the point that we're missing our performance targets?
[01:28:14.464 --> 01:28:18.345]  And they said it really clearly, because, you know, they want control.
[01:28:18.385 --> 01:28:21.187]  They want control of America, and right now they are losing it.
[01:28:21.247 --> 01:28:22.187]  And Stelter said that.
[01:28:22.227 --> 01:28:26.970]  He said, I've talked to the head of CNN, he said, and we're willing to lose all the ratings.
[01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:28.110]  We're just going to keep doing this.
[01:28:28.130 --> 01:28:28.910]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:32.012]  Money is an extension of power.
[01:28:32.112 --> 01:28:36.274]  It's got to be power that they're interested in maintaining above all else.
[01:28:36.294 --> 01:28:38.695]  But the money going down is a gauge of how it's failing.
[01:28:38.755 --> 01:28:39.075]  Yes.
[01:28:39.296 --> 01:28:42.217]  I mean, people are just like, whoa.
[01:28:42.397 --> 01:28:44.518]  Because Americans are nice people.
[01:28:44.998 --> 01:28:46.779]  We're not all these Nazis and crazies.
[01:28:46.839 --> 01:28:47.700]  I like everybody.
[01:28:48.530 --> 01:28:56.571]  But there are a bunch of leftists using our openness and goodness against us, that if they tell us we're Nazis and we don't get on our knees and service them, well guess what?
[01:28:56.591 --> 01:28:57.412]  I'm not getting on my knees.
[01:28:57.432 --> 01:29:00.332]  And if you want a war, you better believe you've got one.
[01:29:00.352 --> 01:29:01.132]  So feel your hand.
[01:29:02.852 --> 01:29:17.155]  By now it has become crystal clear to everyone that our worst, most frightening analysis of the globalists and who they are and what their endgame is, was in fact completely true, except it was far worse than we even thought.
[01:29:17.987 --> 01:29:23.952]  So I have to apologize to listeners and viewers that we have really steered you wrong the last 25 years.
[01:29:23.972 --> 01:29:26.954]  That things were far worse than we even thought.
[01:29:26.974 --> 01:29:29.716]  And if anything, we held back.
[01:29:29.736 --> 01:29:33.139]  We held back because it just sounded too fantastical.
[01:29:33.239 --> 01:29:45.589]  You see, when you're faced with absolute pure evil and it admits it's evil, and then you think it's going to sound crazy if you tell people, you begin almost aiding the evil by not being completely honest and truthful about what we're facing and what we're
[01:29:45.589 --> 01:29:45.709]  We're
[01:30:09.002 --> 01:30:09.582]  We're good to go.
[01:30:28.551 --> 01:30:30.953]  Only get fulfillment through the lottery ticket.
[01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:33.976]  Only get fulfillment through the fake big box store church.
[01:30:34.156 --> 01:30:37.399]  Only get fulfillment by believing in the system, but it's all empty.
[01:30:37.419 --> 01:30:38.960]  There's only a hysteria.
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:42.824]  There's only a mad dashing over the edge of a cliff.
[01:30:42.924 --> 01:30:46.167]  But on this Black Friday, I want to challenge the listeners.
[01:30:46.347 --> 01:30:47.908]  I want to challenge the viewers.
[01:30:48.108 --> 01:30:52.172]  I want to challenge people to understand how fundamental it is
[01:30:53.098 --> 01:31:09.695]  When you have that relationship with God, when you open up that channel of free will, saying, I want to be in touch with the real creator, the real master, God, not the fallen system, not the fallen entities, not all the space junk, but the real deal, that's the most important thing.
[01:31:11.639 --> 01:31:18.805]  Opening channels up to others who are depressed, who are down, who are beaten down by the system that have been told that they're worthless when they're so incredible.
[01:31:19.045 --> 01:31:26.271]  And then spreading the word about outlets and institutions that the enemy and the world wants to silence by Infowars.com.
[01:31:26.351 --> 01:31:29.413]  And then financially support the broadcast, which is so easy.
[01:31:29.533 --> 01:31:34.377]  So you notice what funds us is t-shirts that spread the word and that help you meet like-minded people.
[01:31:34.557 --> 01:31:36.899]  It's literally a uniform to wear your colors proud.
[01:31:36.919 --> 01:31:38.701]  It can also get you assaulted, get you attacked.
[01:31:38.781 --> 01:31:39.742]  It's powerful.
[01:31:39.802 --> 01:31:41.943]  The water filters we sell are the very best out there.
[01:31:42.023 --> 01:31:44.606]  Help your body cut out the toxins, give you good water.
[01:31:44.626 --> 01:31:47.248]  Funds the operation, the air filtration, same system.
[01:31:47.288 --> 01:31:53.233]  The non-GMO heirloom seeds that regenerate life basically eternally over and over again as long as someone gathers the seeds.
[01:31:53.353 --> 01:31:53.833]  We're good to go.
[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:11.080]  Yeah.
[01:32:28.049 --> 01:32:37.494]  High realms, the quiet place, the most high, King David talked about, where you can see for trillions of miles and have deep understanding, so great, you almost forget the world you're in.
[01:32:37.614 --> 01:32:39.815]  You have to go back into the matrix to save others.
[01:32:39.895 --> 01:32:41.436]  That's what these products do.
[01:32:41.856 --> 01:32:44.578]  They literally fund our operation itself.
[01:32:44.978 --> 01:32:45.418]  Incredible.
[01:32:45.779 --> 01:32:51.862]  But, help you regenerate, help you be more focused, help you be more healthy, are two forms of toothpaste.
[01:32:52.651 --> 01:32:53.632]  Three different types total.
[01:32:54.092 --> 01:32:56.313]  Fluoride-free, colloidal silver, iodine-fortified.
[01:32:56.593 --> 01:32:58.294]  And then now the new whitening toothpaste.
[01:32:58.414 --> 01:32:59.515]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:32:59.535 --> 01:33:00.315]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:33:00.375 --> 01:33:01.156]  It is Black Friday.
[01:33:01.196 --> 01:33:02.036]  Triple patriot points.
[01:33:02.056 --> 01:33:02.797]  Biggest sales ever.
[01:33:04.738 --> 01:33:08.820]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.641]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:17.521 --> 01:33:25.103]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Attorney General William Barr says the death of Epstein was a perfect storm.
[01:33:25.383 --> 01:33:29.884]  And now we can just forget about it and stop asking questions.
[01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:35.306]  You see, the two jail guards fell asleep and that's all that happened, so you need to go back to sleep.
[01:33:35.486 --> 01:33:38.667]  Except they got rid of the regular guards that day and brought in new ones.
[01:33:38.707 --> 01:33:40.567]  The lights turned off, the camera failed.
[01:33:40.707 --> 01:33:43.808]  Epstein said to his lawyers and family, they're trying to murder me.
[01:33:43.968 --> 01:33:45.709]  They'd already tried to kill him in one jail cell.
[01:33:45.749 --> 01:33:49.432]  People around the cell heard him fight for his life and beg for his life.
[01:33:49.472 --> 01:33:58.919]  But he was running child kidnapping rings, not just the underage girls, for the Clintons, for the deep state, for British intelligence, for the CIA, for Mossad, in a huge network.
[01:33:59.059 --> 01:34:01.941]  And now the whole house of cards is coming down.
[01:34:01.981 --> 01:34:02.441]  And guess what?
[01:34:02.481 --> 01:34:02.961]  Come on in here.
[01:34:03.242 --> 01:34:04.462]  Here's our producer, Scott.
[01:34:04.923 --> 01:34:06.124]  It's a limited edition shirt.
[01:34:06.744 --> 01:34:09.344]  Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein.
[01:34:09.705 --> 01:34:11.285]  They don't hang themselves.
[01:34:11.365 --> 01:34:12.725]  Only 2,000 of these have been printed.
[01:34:12.765 --> 01:34:14.145]  It's a really nice sweater.
[01:34:14.185 --> 01:34:14.945]  Turn around, my friend.
[01:34:14.965 --> 01:34:18.246]  It says InfoWars.com with the O as a reef noose.
[01:34:18.406 --> 01:34:19.906]  A great way to expose the deep state.
[01:34:20.006 --> 01:34:22.447]  Exercise your free speech in the face of the globalists.
[01:34:22.527 --> 01:34:23.827]  And they can't stand it.
[01:34:23.887 --> 01:34:24.647]  Limited edition.
[01:34:24.747 --> 01:34:28.468]  Funds the InfoWar high quality at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:34:28.568 --> 01:34:32.668]  Black Friday specials, the biggest ever, are running for a limited time and free shipping.
[01:34:32.988 --> 01:34:35.869]  Triple patriot points at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:37.850]  And again, I really like this shirt.
[01:34:37.930 --> 01:34:38.970]  He was wearing it today.
[01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:42.772]  That reminded me that they just came in, the 18-wheeler, on Thursday.
[01:34:42.792 --> 01:34:44.292]  This is a limited edition shirt.
[01:34:44.392 --> 01:34:45.593]  It funds the Infowar.
[01:34:45.753 --> 01:34:46.353]  Get yours.
[01:34:46.413 --> 01:34:48.474]  And it helps educate people about the Deep State.
[01:34:48.494 --> 01:34:50.515]  It's a great way to start conversations.
[01:34:50.535 --> 01:34:52.515]  The establishment doesn't want you to talk about it.
[01:34:52.535 --> 01:34:53.796]  It's bringing down the whole house of cards.
[01:34:54.116 --> 01:34:55.376]  So be sure and get yours.
[01:34:55.416 --> 01:34:56.357]  A total 360 win.
[01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.199]  Plus, people are into ugly sweaters.
[01:34:58.239 --> 01:35:00.962]  That's kind of the trend right now, is how ugly your Christmas sweater.
[01:35:00.982 --> 01:35:02.323]  Well, it's a very nice white and green.
[01:35:02.724 --> 01:35:06.068]  Nice words, but I gotta agree, that is an ugly mug of Lord Epstein.
[01:35:06.148 --> 01:35:06.909]  So, there you go.
[01:35:07.009 --> 01:35:08.991]  Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein.
[01:35:09.071 --> 01:35:10.473]  They don't hang themselves.
[01:35:10.573 --> 01:35:13.176]  Get your shirt at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[01:35:14.301 --> 01:35:14.621]  Wow!
[01:35:14.821 --> 01:35:17.923]  I need to give a bonus to whoever made that ad in the office.
[01:35:19.464 --> 01:35:20.945]  But I don't have money to give people a bonus.
[01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:22.406]  We're lucky to even operate another year.
[01:35:22.446 --> 01:35:23.187]  I'm not complaining.
[01:35:23.207 --> 01:35:24.548]  Been in this fight a long time.
[01:35:24.568 --> 01:35:26.929]  But the globalists are everywhere trying to take us off air.
[01:35:27.029 --> 01:35:28.070]  It's a goal of theirs.
[01:35:29.437 --> 01:35:31.758]  It's like we're a Roman standard they want to get to take down.
[01:35:31.798 --> 01:35:33.079]  So thank you for spreading the word.
[01:35:33.099 --> 01:35:34.220]  That's how we get around the censors.
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:35.681]  That's how people learn the truth.
[01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:37.242]  So share, ban, not video.
[01:35:37.342 --> 01:35:38.843]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:35:39.423 --> 01:35:42.865]  Now we've still got, because you have 20 phone lines, callers have been holding for over an hour.
[01:35:43.385 --> 01:35:45.427]  I want to get to some of the callers been holding the longest.
[01:35:45.847 --> 01:35:48.248]  So the next three segments you can get to your big presentation.
[01:35:48.649 --> 01:35:52.131]  Briefly tell folks, Zach Voorhees, what's coming up when you go through all these clips you've got.
[01:35:52.771 --> 01:36:00.519]  Okay, so there's one particular clip that I want to show, which is from the ADL's own website on their YouTube page.
[01:36:00.719 --> 01:36:06.004]  And what they're going to talk about is the ADL hate index and how they're working with big tech.
[01:36:06.404 --> 01:36:07.485]  And again, they're inside.
[01:36:07.565 --> 01:36:08.146]  That's admitted.
[01:36:08.266 --> 01:36:10.488]  Inside your profiles, inside your computers.
[01:36:10.789 --> 01:36:11.850]  They're actually watching you.
[01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:12.951]  It's not just what you're doing publicly.
[01:36:13.351 --> 01:36:17.412]  Yeah, they're trying to get information in every single way that they can.
[01:36:17.532 --> 01:36:23.013]  And so they're trying to tell big tech, this needs to be censored because they're spreading conspiracy theories.
[01:36:23.073 --> 01:36:26.773]  And in reality, a lot of these conspiracy theories are actually true.
[01:36:27.233 --> 01:36:31.854]  And what they're just trying to do is they're just trying to, you know... So imagine if the NSA was in your accounts doing that.
[01:36:31.874 --> 01:36:33.234]  It'd be a huge congressional investigation.
[01:36:33.294 --> 01:36:33.734]  It's illegal.
[01:36:34.075 --> 01:36:38.035]  But I mean, they admit NewsGuard, that's Microsoft and others.
[01:36:38.775 --> 01:36:42.436]  It's even in the news that this consortium... Your phone's behind there.
[01:36:43.448 --> 01:36:53.192]  This consortium of people that are doing this from the Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, and other groups literally have access and are even monitoring your private messages.
[01:36:53.712 --> 01:37:03.336]  Yeah, like that's what it turned out with Facebook is that they were allowing, I think, Netflix to like spy on the messages that you were sending to your friends in order to like... They're all doing it.
[01:37:03.396 --> 01:37:09.098]  So why is the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and the left picking this fight with everybody?
[01:37:09.909 --> 01:37:14.852]  I mean, the thing is, is that a whole bunch of damaging information is coming out.
[01:37:15.352 --> 01:37:23.016]  And the thing is, is that they need to lock down the internet because a counterattack is coming by the patriots in America.
[01:37:23.417 --> 01:37:29.500]  And the Jeffrey Epstein is the thread that pulls the whole thing apart.
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:36.064]  It's going to undo the whole rug and the whole tangle of compromised assets in our country.
[01:37:36.644 --> 01:37:37.404]  That's what I believe.
[01:37:37.644 --> 01:37:39.365]  Well, if there's no believe it, that's confirmed.
[01:37:39.545 --> 01:37:39.825]  Yeah.
[01:37:40.425 --> 01:37:42.266]  And just the cover-ups woke everybody up.
[01:37:42.726 --> 01:37:43.006]  Mm-hmm.
[01:37:43.826 --> 01:37:45.707]  I wonder why Epstein woke people up so much.
[01:37:46.767 --> 01:37:53.949]  I mean, I think that there's a lot of intrigue, and I also think that the patriots in America need to get this information out there.
[01:37:54.290 --> 01:38:02.292]  Well, just everybody saying Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself everywhere shows how everyone could take other messages and go viral, like, hey, Infowars.com lives.
[01:38:02.352 --> 01:38:03.272]  That would really upset them.
[01:38:05.353 --> 01:38:10.715]  Again, they really want this operation shut down because of guests like this and this great crew out here that's doing an incredible job.
[01:38:11.515 --> 01:38:13.355]  Let's go to who's been on the longest here.
[01:38:14.076 --> 01:38:17.797]  Let's go ahead and go to Andy in Florida.
[01:38:17.837 --> 01:38:18.397]  Thank you, Andy.
[01:38:18.417 --> 01:38:18.757]  Go ahead.
[01:38:20.057 --> 01:38:21.078]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:21.918 --> 01:38:22.618]  I love you, man.
[01:38:22.678 --> 01:38:23.218]  We love you.
[01:38:23.959 --> 01:38:28.700]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic at hand, I've got to talk about one of your products.
[01:38:29.802 --> 01:38:30.982]  Um, a little bit about me.
[01:38:31.062 --> 01:38:32.443]  I'm 245 pounds.
[01:38:32.523 --> 01:38:35.204]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[01:38:36.084 --> 01:38:40.345]  And to make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[01:38:40.365 --> 01:38:46.047]  I do have ADHD, but, you know, I was taking Adderall for its energy boosting properties.
[01:38:46.067 --> 01:38:47.727]  You know, I kind of got a little out of hand.
[01:38:47.807 --> 01:38:50.848]  And, um, you know, I listen to you religiously in my truck every day.
[01:38:51.508 --> 01:38:55.790]  Um, so I tried your turbo force and really it's a cliche.
[01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:56.990]  This product changed my life, but.
[01:38:57.475 --> 01:38:59.276]  TurboForce really changed my life.
[01:38:59.296 --> 01:39:09.644]  Needless to say, I no longer take Adderall, and I get by literally the 13 hours a day I work on a half of a packet of your TurboForce.
[01:39:09.664 --> 01:39:12.907]  And right now it's, what, $29.99?
[01:39:13.127 --> 01:39:16.409]  If you take a half a packet, that's literally a dollar a day.
[01:39:18.323 --> 01:39:20.789]  You saved so much money versus, you know, a Monster, which is, what, $499?
[01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:25.959]  And, you know, I just had to call in and tell you guys how great Turbo Force is.
[01:39:25.979 --> 01:39:28.504]  And if anybody's on the fence, they really have to try it.
[01:39:29.141 --> 01:39:34.184]  Well, I went out to four or five, I think it was five, of the big top places.
[01:39:34.224 --> 01:39:38.466]  We paid a very famous individual who developed supplements, a lot of money to develop it.
[01:39:38.486 --> 01:39:40.587]  He didn't want his name on it, obviously, because of all the demonization.
[01:39:41.067 --> 01:39:44.849]  And I wanted a 10-hour energy, but we couldn't call it that because of trademark names and things.
[01:39:45.150 --> 01:39:52.554]  But it's really 10-hour clean energy that doesn't have the big comedown, got a lot of minerals and vitamins and other things in it.
[01:39:53.394 --> 01:39:57.596]  And so, TurboForce is the strongest, cleanest stuff you're going to find out there.
[01:39:57.616 --> 01:40:02.538]  And so, let me just briefly ask you, what's the energy like from TurboForce versus Adderall?
[01:40:03.858 --> 01:40:09.760]  Well, see, Adderall makes you, to be honest, my wife hated me on it.
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:18.044]  You know, it kind of made me real irritable and, you know, you really are just like a walking zombie, you know, even if you take the prescribed dose, in my opinion.
[01:40:18.384 --> 01:40:20.205]  And the TurboForce is more, you know, just a
[01:40:21.809 --> 01:40:24.530]  Just a regular, you know, just have steady energy.
[01:40:24.590 --> 01:40:26.571]  You know, it's not like an up or down, and that's the best part.
[01:40:26.591 --> 01:40:27.271]  There's no down.
[01:40:27.932 --> 01:40:29.372]  You know, you just, that's it.
[01:40:29.693 --> 01:40:30.613]  Well, that's what we set out.
[01:40:30.753 --> 01:40:34.395]  Really strong, but a clean awake that lasts a long time.
[01:40:34.895 --> 01:40:39.757]  And we paid a lot for the formula, and there's more in this packet than any other brand.
[01:40:39.777 --> 01:40:44.459]  I mean, you can buy stuff at a gas station for two pills or five bucks in a light ship, because it's got a bunch of poison in it.
[01:40:44.859 --> 01:40:47.000]  But we're really proud of Turbo Force, so thank you, sir.
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:50.402]  Did you want to comment on all the current crazy news?
[01:40:52.987 --> 01:40:54.809]  I have a question really for you, Alex.
[01:40:54.829 --> 01:41:02.996]  It's really not going to go with what's on topic, but how do you go from every day to knowing these people are gunning for you, man?
[01:41:03.016 --> 01:41:12.664]  I'm not trying to be a Debbie here, but do you have any systems in place if something ever happened to you?
[01:41:12.744 --> 01:41:14.566]  I never heard you comment on this.
[01:41:14.806 --> 01:41:17.809]  If you were gone tomorrow, what, is Rex taking over or what?
[01:41:18.888 --> 01:41:25.735]  Well, you know, I mean, I've tried to tell the crew, you know, I made a plan to keep operations going, keep people on air, keep resisting.
[01:41:27.157 --> 01:41:35.046]  But see, they want to kill my name first, they want to assassinate my character, then capture who I am, and then basically take me off air and put me in prison.
[01:41:35.606 --> 01:41:36.327]  So that's the plan.
[01:41:36.667 --> 01:41:42.050]  The platformers shut us down, then put me in prison, and then say things in my name.
[01:41:42.090 --> 01:41:46.993]  All these TV shows, all these movies where they admit it's an Alex Jones character, they don't want me there to counter it.
[01:41:47.053 --> 01:41:51.696]  So they want me to be a new emoji, basically, a new icon that says horrible things.
[01:41:54.011 --> 01:42:04.473]  In the name of the American people, and that decision's been made, and so they're attempting, they believe archetypally, that they could destroy me, and they're the ones that made all this weird metaphysical decisions.
[01:42:04.493 --> 01:42:13.916]  I didn't think I was that important, but they definitely think the spirit that InfoWars is has to be shut down, captured, imprisoned, and then they're gonna try to misrepresent it.
[01:42:14.216 --> 01:42:14.896]  Everybody's their plan.
[01:42:15.287 --> 01:42:24.951]  Yeah, like when they take someone down, it's a process which involves getting rid of the periphery nodes in the network, because there's always a network of individuals when they're trying to take someone down.
[01:42:25.111 --> 01:42:28.232]  You try to get rid of the people on the outside periphery and move inwards.
[01:42:28.713 --> 01:42:30.493]  Alex, you're like in the middle of it right now.
[01:42:30.553 --> 01:42:40.938]  They're gunning for you, and I thank you for everything that you do in getting the truth out there, and we're going to keep fighting to bring this truth out to you and this very important information.
[01:42:41.718 --> 01:42:43.779]  Well, I mean, I'll tell you, it's the responsibility of it.
[01:42:43.799 --> 01:42:45.539]  That's why I get so frustrated with the crew and everybody else.
[01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:46.300]  They're doing a great job.
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:47.380]  It's just, there's just so much.
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:50.461]  And then I know there's limited time and the piranhas are eating through.
[01:42:50.481 --> 01:42:52.922]  I'm not even worried about it.
[01:42:52.942 --> 01:42:55.623]  In a way, it's going to kind of be relaxing when they're chewing me all up or whatever.
[01:42:55.663 --> 01:42:59.684]  But it's just right now, we've got to fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight as hard as we can.
[01:43:04.966 --> 01:43:07.207]  It has been an incredible journey.
[01:43:08.385 --> 01:43:13.028]  Four Info Wars in the last four years.
[01:43:14.409 --> 01:43:20.493]  And it's been a journey that I have been honored and privileged to be a part of.
[01:43:21.764 --> 01:43:29.549]  And I was thinking about how far it's come since 2016 in the election of President Trump to where we are now.
[01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:50.783]  And I'm just thinking about the impact, the censorship, all the news that we've uncovered years before everybody else, but also knowing the threat that free speech is under and knowing the threat that InfoWars has right now by the globalists, by the Democrats, by the deep state, by Hollywood, by all these people that want us off air.
[01:43:52.045 --> 01:43:58.372]  And so I was kind of thinking, how can I get the audience to understand this on a personal level?
[01:43:59.915 --> 01:44:14.529]  And I realized that if you just look at where InfoWars was at 2015 to 16, and now 2019 to 20, we can take a look at where InfoWars was and is, and where it should be going or can be going.
[01:44:14.649 --> 01:44:17.752]  So, what did InfoWars do in 2015 and 2016 that was so important?
[01:44:17.812 --> 01:44:19.453]  Well, the story is, in 2016, that was the moment
[01:44:23.337 --> 01:44:38.321]  That Infowars, this audience, Alex Jones, our team of reporters were pretty much solidified in American history and were pretty much certified as now the most powerful and influential name in news.
[01:44:38.621 --> 01:44:48.583]  And before they could pretend like it didn't exist, before they could just cast us off, before they could just ignore us and demonize us, but then in 2016 we got Trump elected.
[01:44:48.883 --> 01:44:50.724]  This audience, this platform.
[01:44:51.104 --> 01:44:53.325]  Literally the one I'm standing on right here.
[01:44:54.166 --> 01:44:59.868]  Because if you flash back the clocks, folks, you'll remember most Fox News hosts, if not all of them, were not pro-Trump.
[01:44:59.968 --> 01:45:07.752]  The average conservative out there that's selling Trump gear or the average conservative ink person that's stumping for Trump now was not a Trump supporter back then.
[01:45:07.932 --> 01:45:11.054]  Because the Republican Party didn't want Trump, the mainstream news didn't want Trump.
[01:45:11.094 --> 01:45:22.862]  So it was this audience, it was the people that share these links, the people that tune in, the people that call in, the people that are red-pilled, the people that are quote-unquote woke to the government corruption, knew it came from both sides.
[01:45:22.982 --> 01:45:28.026]  We got Trump elected, that solidified InfoWars as influential, effective, and victorious.
[01:45:28.306 --> 01:45:33.329]  And so this sent the Democrats, the mainstream media, the globalists into a total panic.
[01:45:33.529 --> 01:45:37.272]  And that's why they've thus tried to keep InfoWars off of all platforms.
[01:45:37.352 --> 01:45:45.538]  But you see, 2016 was the demarcation line where InfoWars was influential, successful, and there is nothing they can do about it except shut us down.
[01:45:45.658 --> 01:45:48.300]  So that's where InfoWars was at, had a victory.
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:50.221]  Now InfoWars is at a different point.
[01:45:50.301 --> 01:45:55.025]  We've already solidified ourselves as influential, impactful, moving into the future.
[01:45:55.225 --> 01:46:00.689]  Now the next challenge is to solidify ourselves as bigger than the establishment.
[01:46:00.909 --> 01:46:03.191]  Free speech, bigger than the establishment.
[01:46:03.251 --> 01:46:05.652]  The truth, bigger than the establishment.
[01:46:05.953 --> 01:46:06.493]  And that's
[01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:18.260]  Literally only possible with your support at InfoWarsStore.com, because just like, can we get Trump over the hump and the Republican nomination so that he can beat Hillary Clinton with InfoWars and this audience pushing him to the finish line?
[01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:19.300]  The answer was yes.
[01:46:19.521 --> 01:46:29.687]  Now the question is, can InfoWars survive as a news organization with all the lawsuits, the demonization, the lies, the attacks, the censorship?
[01:46:30.547 --> 01:46:37.829]  Can we survive and still be on air and expand and be more effective than ever despite all the attacks they have against us?
[01:46:37.869 --> 01:46:42.051]  So just like we had a victory in 2016, give us a victory in 2020.
[01:46:42.171 --> 01:46:45.832]  Keep InfoWars on the air by taking advantage of the Black Friday specials, folks.
[01:46:45.892 --> 01:46:46.812]  We make it easy.
[01:46:46.972 --> 01:46:55.395]  Triple Patriot points so that we can hire the next Owen Schroer, the next Kaitlyn Bennett, the next Millie Weaver, just like in 2016 when I was hired.
[01:46:55.495 --> 01:46:57.436]  Who will be the next star that you make possible in 2020?
[01:47:05.003 --> 01:47:09.086]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:09.106 --> 01:47:10.928]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:17.208 --> 01:47:20.770]  Alex Jones here live on this Monday, November 24th edition.
[01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:23.791]  But that's not Alex Jones sitting in my chair.
[01:47:24.511 --> 01:47:25.772]  That's Rob Dew.
[01:47:26.592 --> 01:47:29.073]  All right, one of the great info lawyers here in the office.
[01:47:29.954 --> 01:47:31.614]  And he's the news director.
[01:47:31.634 --> 01:47:34.255]  That means he does more work to most people, but everybody does a great job here.
[01:47:34.275 --> 01:47:36.336]  And he was working on something this weekend.
[01:47:36.376 --> 01:47:38.437]  I forgot he was working on it, but he wants to premiere it here.
[01:47:38.457 --> 01:47:40.278]  Then we'll continue into the next hour.
[01:47:40.298 --> 01:47:42.419]  I'll do 30 minutes more with
[01:47:42.859 --> 01:47:48.431]  Zach Voorhees, the Google whistleblower, will go through his presentation and then the great Charles Salente will take over.
[01:47:48.491 --> 01:47:50.475]  But, my buddy is here!
[01:47:51.405 --> 01:48:03.971]  And so tell us, you've got your own Jeffrey Epstein angle here, you're also an established, you know, quite a musician, so tell us about this little cultural thought crime offering that's not going to make the Deep State too happy.
[01:48:03.991 --> 01:48:07.793]  No, it's definitely not, and I want to say this was a Total Info Wars production.
[01:48:08.093 --> 01:48:17.257]  I contacted Don, he's playing drums, John Bowne's playing guitar, and Derek is playing the bass and I'm singing, and I wrote this song in about a day and a half.
[01:48:17.717 --> 01:48:21.539]  And I contacted my buddy who has a studio down the road, and we went and recorded it last night.
[01:48:21.579 --> 01:48:22.919]  Oh, you're the one playing guitar in bed.
[01:48:22.939 --> 01:48:30.982]  Yeah, I'm usually playing, but this time I'm singing, I'm fronting it, I've got some crazed, it's crazed, it's definitely crazed, I'll say that.
[01:48:31.022 --> 01:48:37.825]  But, you know, I got sick of hearing that, oh, you know, and then Bill Barr came out and put Bill Barr in the song, because, well, he showed it didn't really happen.
[01:48:37.885 --> 01:48:39.085]  I don't care what he says, man.
[01:48:39.305 --> 01:48:41.986]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself, and that's the tagline.
[01:48:42.026 --> 01:48:42.947]  And that's the name of the song?
[01:48:43.067 --> 01:48:44.127]  Yeah, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[01:48:44.147 --> 01:48:46.208]  And I'm told a music video is coming.
[01:48:46.368 --> 01:48:46.628]  Yes.
[01:48:46.969 --> 01:48:48.470]  It'll drop in 24 hours.
[01:48:48.570 --> 01:48:52.814]  So without further ado, here's the live premiere of the song.
[01:48:57.119 --> 01:49:01.643]  He was buddies with a Clinton, Prince Andrew too.
[01:49:01.683 --> 01:49:05.327]  He had a stable of girls for you to peruse.
[01:49:05.707 --> 01:49:08.189]  But now we'll never know who.
[01:49:25.777 --> 01:49:27.017]  Jeffery Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:49:27.477 --> 01:49:29.458]  Jeffery Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:49:29.878 --> 01:49:31.818]  Jeffery Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:49:32.278 --> 01:49:34.019]  Jeffery Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:49:34.619 --> 01:49:38.940]  And I don't care what Bill Barr says, cause Jeffery Epstein didn't kill himself!
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:43.401]  He had a big ol' plane, the Lolita Express.
[01:49:44.501 --> 01:49:48.042]  Padded floors, and no secret service.
[01:49:49.002 --> 01:49:52.483]  But the feds know who flew, and that's why he didn't kill himself.
[01:49:56.409 --> 01:49:58.131]  There you go, folks.
[01:50:14.366 --> 01:50:15.587]  An InfoWars original.
[01:50:15.607 --> 01:50:16.008]  Is there more?
[01:50:16.028 --> 01:50:16.668]  That's good.
[01:50:17.049 --> 01:50:17.890]  There's four verses.
[01:50:18.330 --> 01:50:18.811]  Oh, let's hear it.
[01:50:18.831 --> 01:50:19.792]  Four verses, man.
[01:50:19.832 --> 01:50:20.192]  We get deep.
[01:50:20.212 --> 01:50:21.974]  We get deep into the details.
[01:50:22.334 --> 01:50:23.556]  Well, we gotta have this go viral.
[01:50:23.716 --> 01:50:23.996]  Oh, yeah.
[01:50:24.116 --> 01:50:24.577]  I think so.
[01:50:25.017 --> 01:50:28.280]  I mean, one way to do it is premiere it on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:30.162]  You know what that reminds me of?
[01:50:30.202 --> 01:50:33.226]  That reminds me of that Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[01:50:33.246 --> 01:50:33.746]  There you go.
[01:50:33.766 --> 01:50:34.507]  Let's hear it again right here.
[01:50:38.940 --> 01:50:42.144]  It's very infectious, isn't it?
[01:50:42.204 --> 01:50:43.786]  A lot like Christmas lights.
[01:50:43.986 --> 01:50:44.587]  Yeah.
[01:50:44.727 --> 01:50:48.331]  Christmas lights and drywall just don't hang themselves.
[01:50:56.099 --> 01:50:58.039]  Man, you can just really extend on that.
[01:50:58.199 --> 01:50:58.680]  Oh, yeah.
[01:50:58.740 --> 01:51:01.880]  I'm the worst when talking over it, but we need to release this immediately.
[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:02.240]  Yeah.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.720]  People want to get this now.
[01:51:03.821 --> 01:51:06.241]  Release the audio, and then folks can put their own video to it.
[01:51:06.261 --> 01:51:06.901]  We'll have a $5,000 contest.
[01:51:06.921 --> 01:51:07.641]  There you go.
[01:51:07.681 --> 01:51:08.281]  Come on.
[01:51:08.301 --> 01:51:09.222]  We'll launch it today.
[01:51:09.242 --> 01:51:09.662]  Put it up.
[01:51:09.682 --> 01:51:10.462]  Just get the audio.
[01:51:10.482 --> 01:51:10.462]  $5,000.
[01:51:10.682 --> 01:51:12.962]  But we'll have to announce the winner by, like, say, next Friday.
[01:51:22.324 --> 01:51:23.145]  Yeah.
[01:51:23.265 --> 01:51:23.145]  $5,000.
[01:51:24.045 --> 01:51:25.006]  Add your video to it.
[01:51:25.066 --> 01:51:26.908]  Tag Band.Video to it.
[01:51:27.488 --> 01:51:31.151]  And what'll go into it is whatever gets the most views and who does the best job of video.
[01:51:31.171 --> 01:51:32.212]  Those two things will go into it.
[01:51:32.652 --> 01:51:33.753]  That's one way to make it viral.
[01:51:34.694 --> 01:51:35.715]  Alright, absolutely.
[01:51:35.795 --> 01:51:38.337]  So, Rob, what's your take on all this situation?
[01:51:39.335 --> 01:51:46.237]  Well, obviously, you know, I kind of like the angle that they smuggled him out because he was an intelligence asset, and I can totally believe that at this point.
[01:51:46.877 --> 01:51:50.338]  But definitely, the guy didn't kill himself, the ADL attack.
[01:51:50.358 --> 01:51:56.420]  So it's funny, they get him out, and now the ADL's attacking you with Sacha Baron Cohen, who's a guy who just runs around.
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:04.782]  It's funny, it's like, there's this guy, Jones, he makes Jew joke after Jew joke after Jew joke after Jew joke, and then one day, someone else makes a Jew joke around him, and he goes, hey man, that's a Jew joke.
[01:52:04.902 --> 01:52:05.382]  That's offensive.
[01:52:05.842 --> 01:52:08.504]  And it's like, hey dude, you've been making Jew jokes for 20 years.
[01:52:08.885 --> 01:52:09.465]  You know, who cares?
[01:52:09.485 --> 01:52:11.226]  Meanwhile, we don't even... We don't even make those.
[01:52:11.427 --> 01:52:12.948]  But it's like, we're the Nazis though.
[01:52:13.168 --> 01:52:13.688]  Oh, I know, exactly.
[01:52:13.708 --> 01:52:15.250]  And like, we're supposed to just sit there and take it.
[01:52:15.410 --> 01:52:16.411]  Yeah, no, it's ridiculous.
[01:52:16.471 --> 01:52:19.353]  And that guy has the gall to sit there and now I'm going to be the policeman.
[01:52:19.473 --> 01:52:20.014]  But he's not.
[01:52:20.034 --> 01:52:21.415]  That's the plan.
[01:52:21.555 --> 01:52:21.835]  Oh, yeah.
[01:52:22.195 --> 01:52:22.876]  It's arrest.
[01:52:23.096 --> 01:52:25.058]  They're telling, we're going to arrest the tech heads.
[01:52:26.252 --> 01:52:27.612]  And unless you purge everyone.
[01:52:27.632 --> 01:52:28.813]  I mean, how authoritarian is that?
[01:52:28.973 --> 01:52:29.433]  Exactly.
[01:52:29.713 --> 01:52:31.054]  And it's like, oh, they haven't done enough?
[01:52:31.534 --> 01:52:34.375]  Like, it takes a lot of work now than what we used to do.
[01:52:34.395 --> 01:52:37.036]  We used to just put stuff out and be like, ah, look at all the views it gets.
[01:52:37.096 --> 01:52:38.696]  Because people were hungry for the information.
[01:52:39.096 --> 01:52:42.717]  Now we really have to work to get people to see stuff other than the core audience.
[01:52:42.757 --> 01:52:44.538]  And the core audience does a great job putting stuff out.
[01:52:44.558 --> 01:52:47.539]  But folks, we're fighting so hard and the enemy's so scared of you.
[01:52:47.999 --> 01:52:49.100]  Just go to Bandai Video.
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:49.940]  Take the live streams.
[01:52:50.020 --> 01:52:50.340]  Everybody.
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:51.141]  I totally agree.
[01:53:05.738 --> 01:53:06.759]  And don't be racist.
[01:53:06.819 --> 01:53:11.101]  Don't go to their level because the ADL wants to say, oh by the way, we're Jewish.
[01:53:11.121 --> 01:53:12.922]  We're going to take your rights and lock you up in jail.
[01:53:13.203 --> 01:53:13.903]  You're all Nazis.
[01:53:13.943 --> 01:53:14.563]  America sucks.
[01:53:14.603 --> 01:53:20.907]  Those people don't represent anybody but the globalists, just like the Southern Poverty Law Center and CNN, MSNBC.
[01:53:20.927 --> 01:53:28.512]  These are just a bunch of really, you know, nasty people that think you're stupid and think that they can bully you to accept their globalist agenda or they're going to call you a Nazi.
[01:53:28.552 --> 01:53:29.212]  It's not going to work.
[01:53:29.232 --> 01:53:30.313]  We're not going to get down to their level.
[01:53:30.553 --> 01:53:31.314]  We're just going to expose it.
[01:53:31.334 --> 01:53:32.394]  Well, and think about this, Alex.
[01:53:32.534 --> 01:53:35.196]  We're already on a tilted playing field and they're still attacking you.
[01:53:35.356 --> 01:53:36.177]  They're still scared of you.
[01:53:36.818 --> 01:53:39.681]  They don't like what InfoWars and Alex Jones is putting out there.
[01:53:39.981 --> 01:53:45.067]  So they're still, even though we're like back here fighting uphill every time we're trying to do something, we have to fight uphill.
[01:53:45.087 --> 01:53:47.229]  And they're like, oh god, we have to attack them more.
[01:53:47.289 --> 01:53:47.890]  It's not working.
[01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:49.171]  Whatever we're doing is not working.
[01:53:49.211 --> 01:53:50.172]  People are seeing through it.
[01:53:50.192 --> 01:53:51.093]  They're putting on their glasses.
[01:53:51.113 --> 01:53:51.614]  They can see.
[01:53:51.654 --> 01:53:52.114]  Well, make no mistake.
[01:53:52.134 --> 01:53:52.615]  They're freaking out.
[01:53:53.035 --> 01:53:56.298]  They attack Immoral Wars because they see it as populist as the people, because we are.
[01:53:56.358 --> 01:53:59.040]  We're real, we're independent, and they can't control what we say.
[01:53:59.260 --> 01:54:00.241]  They can't buy us.
[01:54:00.661 --> 01:54:06.305]  And so the big corporations literally, you know, Tim Cook saying, oh, I'm a moral person, Alex Jones is immoral.
[01:54:06.506 --> 01:54:08.507]  The guy runs the worst damn factories on the planet.
[01:54:08.627 --> 01:54:08.787]  Yeah.
[01:54:08.967 --> 01:54:10.529]  I mean, literal suicide nets.
[01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:11.469]  Suicide nets.
[01:54:11.529 --> 01:54:14.091]  But it's okay, he's like, I'm gay, so it's okay.
[01:54:14.472 --> 01:54:15.973]  Like, who cares if you're gay, dude?
[01:54:16.633 --> 01:54:16.773]  Yeah.
[01:54:17.914 --> 01:54:18.495]  It's ironic.
[01:54:18.715 --> 01:54:19.176]  And you know what?
[01:54:19.196 --> 01:54:27.866]  The reason why they're coming after you, Alex, is because when I was working at YouTube, your live TV show went to the top of the search rankings.
[01:54:28.087 --> 01:54:29.508]  And people were searching for you.
[01:54:29.548 --> 01:54:31.250]  They were watching your material.
[01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:33.213]  And notice why they had to take you out.
[01:54:33.353 --> 01:54:34.034]  In fact, let's do this.
[01:54:34.074 --> 01:54:35.515]  Go to YouTube right now, guys.
[01:54:35.716 --> 01:54:36.817]  Just on screen for TV viewers.
[01:54:37.117 --> 01:54:37.998]  Type in Alex Jones.
[01:54:38.118 --> 01:54:41.462]  And it's all these pinned lies and attacks about me.
[01:54:42.003 --> 01:54:46.588]  And then people have to hand search my name and then click date added and click the last week or last month to find it.
[01:54:46.868 --> 01:54:49.351]  Because it's nothing but lies for a hundred pages on top.
[01:54:49.691 --> 01:54:53.095]  So that when people look for my name, it sends traffic to all of these people.
[01:54:53.235 --> 01:54:53.776]  Go ahead and show them.
[01:54:54.156 --> 01:54:55.077]  Yeah, there's the first one.
[01:54:55.257 --> 01:55:00.243]  Megan Kelly, and then this week with John Oliver, you know, when he's not hanging out.
[01:55:00.383 --> 01:55:03.827]  CBS in the morning, Bloomberg, CNN, it's all mainstream media live.
[01:55:03.868 --> 01:55:05.570]  CNBC, it just goes down the list.
[01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:08.893]  Inside Edition, CNET, it's literally, and then all they do...
[01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:12.451]  YouTube just sends that stuff up to the top.
[01:55:12.471 --> 01:55:13.612]  Doesn't matter, you can even type it.
[01:55:13.652 --> 01:55:15.853]  All those videos have like 20,000, 100,000 views.
[01:55:15.894 --> 01:55:18.616]  A lot of them have like 30, 40 million views now.
[01:55:18.656 --> 01:55:19.656]  Everybody's looking for Alex Jones.
[01:55:19.696 --> 01:55:20.437]  They watch those!
[01:55:20.677 --> 01:55:27.282]  Well look, 16 million views is to Alex Jones Returns, which is almost more than all the other ones, except for there's a new... Yeah, no, look at that.
[01:55:27.402 --> 01:55:31.325]  I don't think... I think that's the most viewed, even though it's like 8th or 9th down.
[01:55:31.585 --> 01:55:31.745]  Yeah.
[01:55:32.626 --> 01:55:34.628]  Isn't that weird how it gets pushed down like that?
[01:55:34.648 --> 01:55:37.431]  And the thing is, is that, you know, you think, well, it's just Alex Jones.
[01:55:37.451 --> 01:55:38.652]  He's a little bit on the fringe.
[01:55:38.692 --> 01:55:40.774]  But now they're doing it to Tulsi Gabbard.
[01:55:40.854 --> 01:55:41.995]  Now they're doing it to everyone.
[01:55:42.095 --> 01:55:42.836]  And now it's spreading.
[01:55:42.876 --> 01:55:43.677]  Well, they tested it out.
[01:55:43.777 --> 01:55:48.481]  They tested it out on InfoWars and Alex Jones and said, OK, now we've got the algorithm perfected.
[01:55:48.781 --> 01:55:54.687]  We can institute this out to anybody that doesn't push the party line, whichever the globalist party happens to be running at the time.
[01:55:54.867 --> 01:55:56.930]  All right, hey, $5,000 contest.
[01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:57.992]  We're getting old days.
[01:55:58.112 --> 01:55:59.114]  We had something over $100,000.
[01:55:59.154 --> 01:55:59.534]  We can't do it.
[01:56:00.576 --> 01:56:06.005]  $5,000, you'll judge it off of the view count and how good the video is.
[01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:06.585]  Badassness.
[01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:07.387]  Yeah, badassness.
[01:56:07.407 --> 01:56:08.649]  I'll let you totally judge it, $5,000, and then
[01:56:10.583 --> 01:56:12.325]  It'll go off of you, Count, but also how good it is.
[01:56:12.485 --> 01:56:12.825]  Alright.
[01:56:12.866 --> 01:56:14.828]  But I want to just... I'm gonna go put the song up right now.
[01:56:15.228 --> 01:56:17.731]  And I want to go ahead and announce it and pay it out next Friday.
[01:56:17.751 --> 01:56:18.371]  It's a quick deal.
[01:56:18.391 --> 01:56:18.752]  It's easy.
[01:56:18.972 --> 01:56:22.316]  Your music videos, upload them to a public source, get them out there.
[01:56:22.416 --> 01:56:23.197]  Send us a link, yeah.
[01:56:23.537 --> 01:56:23.877]  Absolutely.
[01:56:23.897 --> 01:56:25.359]  Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
[01:56:25.379 --> 01:56:26.580]  You can also use the lyrics.
[01:56:27.421 --> 01:56:28.462]  And make your own video.
[01:56:28.482 --> 01:56:30.642]  Let's do it that way too, but use your lyrics.
[01:56:30.662 --> 01:56:31.023]  That's fine.
[01:56:31.263 --> 01:56:36.545]  I'll post the lyrics on there and you can't, I think you can't get hit for copyright because it's our songs.
[01:56:36.565 --> 01:56:40.547]  Well done Lord Vader, you have done well.
[01:56:40.607 --> 01:56:42.608]  Should they post it to Twitter with a hashtag?
[01:56:42.668 --> 01:56:44.969]  Post it with anything man, it doesn't matter.
[01:56:45.009 --> 01:56:47.650]  What's going to happen is people are going to start doing their own things.
[01:56:47.690 --> 01:56:52.032]  Everybody's going, oh $5,000 and they're going to start making their own plans and it's just, it's going to viral out.
[01:56:52.072 --> 01:56:55.093]  And we're going to give the globalists their reward when Darth Vader comes.
[01:56:55.253 --> 01:56:55.593]  That's right.
[01:56:55.653 --> 01:56:56.193]  They're going to get it.
[01:56:56.313 --> 01:56:57.874]  They're going to get eternal damnation.
[01:56:57.894 --> 01:57:00.896]  It's hilarious.
[01:57:01.796 --> 01:57:02.496]  It's hilarious.
[01:57:02.556 --> 01:57:02.856]  All right.
[01:57:02.916 --> 01:57:04.057]  We've got a lot of great callers.
[01:57:04.077 --> 01:57:04.417]  Good job, dude.
[01:57:04.437 --> 01:57:04.857]  Thank you.
[01:57:04.877 --> 01:57:08.299]  We're going to go on a break, and you're going to get your presentation in, and then we're going to get to some of these callers, at least.
[01:57:08.679 --> 01:57:10.960]  I'm trying to get to all of them, but who have we got holding here?
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:11.981]  We're going to get to everybody here.
[01:57:13.908 --> 01:57:16.552]  Gary and Jefferson and everybody else on the other side.
[01:57:16.572 --> 01:57:17.753]  And I don't want to sit here and plug again.
[01:57:18.054 --> 01:57:19.255]  We have the money to fund ourselves.
[01:57:19.275 --> 01:57:22.960]  I would not be plugging constantly, but I don't want to shut InfoWars down.
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:23.982]  I don't want the Globalists to win.
[01:57:24.002 --> 01:57:24.963]  I really, really don't.
[01:57:24.983 --> 01:57:26.325]  And we've got products you already need.
[01:57:26.345 --> 01:57:27.767]  A lot of stuff that was sold out is back in.
[01:57:27.887 --> 01:57:29.149]  Triple Patriot points.
[01:57:29.169 --> 01:57:29.890]  Never done that before.
[01:57:31.804 --> 01:57:37.009]  Storewide free shipping, a free bottle of Brain Force Plus with DNA Force Plus.
[01:57:37.029 --> 01:57:40.432]  Take action today and give Christmas gifts of our products as well.
[01:57:40.552 --> 01:57:42.414]  Please help me fight the gloveless harder.
[01:57:42.514 --> 01:57:45.637]  I want to destroy them, but I cannot do it without your help.
[01:57:45.697 --> 01:57:48.360]  Hour number four is only two minutes away.
[01:57:56.252 --> 01:57:58.173]  I want to talk about this Vasso beat.
[01:57:58.253 --> 01:58:04.075]  Now, when I say that I really love this stuff, I talked to the crew during the break and I said, please find me a bottle.
[01:58:04.175 --> 01:58:06.396]  It says take two dropper fulls daily.
[01:58:06.576 --> 01:58:09.157]  And I've already taken one this morning and I like to spread it out.
[01:58:09.257 --> 01:58:12.539]  Now, I have taken both of them at the same time just because I love this stuff.
[01:58:12.579 --> 01:58:14.599]  But for the most part, I'll take it throughout the day.
[01:58:14.639 --> 01:58:16.820]  I'll take one in the morning and I'll take one in the evening.
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:17.921]  So what I'm going to do,
[01:58:18.881 --> 01:58:20.502]  I'm going to take this live on the air.
[01:58:20.642 --> 01:58:25.685]  So actually, let me put a drop here on the paper here so you can see the actual color.
[01:58:25.705 --> 01:58:26.626]  Look how dark that is.
[01:58:26.746 --> 01:58:28.167]  And see, it just doesn't run.
[01:58:28.267 --> 01:58:29.948]  It just doesn't bead immediately.
[01:58:30.048 --> 01:58:30.508]  Look at that.
[01:58:30.628 --> 01:58:33.350]  I mean, it's like holding its form, but it's liquid.
[01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:35.971]  It's almost like the color of blood, right?
[01:58:35.991 --> 01:58:36.592]  Can you see that?
[01:58:36.652 --> 01:58:37.692]  Look how red that is.
[01:58:37.772 --> 01:58:41.394]  Now, when you put blood together all in one drop, it is dark.
[01:58:41.635 --> 01:58:42.615]  Same thing with this.
[01:58:42.755 --> 01:58:43.456]  And this works.
[01:58:43.496 --> 01:58:45.577]  This is very good for your blood system as well.
[01:58:45.657 --> 01:58:46.899]  Well, it's absolutely wonderful.
[01:58:46.979 --> 01:58:49.242]  OK, so now I have to be really careful here.
[01:58:49.342 --> 01:58:51.966]  If I get it on my suit, it's going to remain on my suit.
[01:58:52.427 --> 01:58:54.770]  And I don't even know if I can take it to the dry cleaners to get it out.
[01:58:55.411 --> 01:58:56.973]  OK, so I'm going to be real careful here.
[01:58:58.035 --> 01:58:58.856]  Here we go.
[01:58:58.896 --> 01:58:59.197]  Here we go.
