[00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.941]  We've got it.
[00:00:01.941 --> 00:00:08.466]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:12.809]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.314]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:18.314 --> 00:00:23.378]  Well, it's Tuesday, Tuesday, March 5th, 2019, and we're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:33.605]  A giant internet ban has now been launched and is now beginning.
[00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:35.306]  I warned people of this a long time ago.
[00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.488]  It has nothing to do with porn.
[00:00:37.488 --> 00:00:42.973]  The UK is moving to, quote, ban porn that's free, coming up on April 1st.
[00:00:42.973 --> 00:00:45.035]  But it's really an April Fool's joke on everybody.
[00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:46.256]  We'll talk about that after the break.
[00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:49.639]  But first, I wanted to get to this key report that was predicted by us.
[00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:50.820]  Russiagate is a fraud.
[00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.902]  Now they move on to the rest of their scams.
[00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:59.064]  Fight so hard on this witch hunt, this phony deal that they put together.
[00:00:59.064 --> 00:01:02.186]  This phony thing that now looks like it's dying.
[00:01:02.186 --> 00:01:04.587]  So they don't have anything with Russia.
[00:01:04.587 --> 00:01:05.968]  There's no collusion.
[00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:11.131]  So now they go and morph into, let's inspect every deal he's ever done.
[00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:14.873]  A little shifty shift yesterday.
[00:01:14.873 --> 00:01:17.615]  It's the first time he went into a meeting.
[00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:21.393]  And he said, we're going to look into his finance.
[00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:22.613]  I said, where did that come from?
[00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:29.177]  He always talked about Russia, collusion with Russia, the collusion delusion.
[00:01:29.177 --> 00:01:38.023]  And unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there.
[00:01:38.023 --> 00:01:42.706]  And all of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bull, okay?
[00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:46.057]  The witch hunt won't die.
[00:01:46.057 --> 00:01:57.849]  That is if House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler and Congressman Adam Schiff continue to fantasize regularly on national television about the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
[00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.933]  We are certainly looking deep into the set of issues around Moscow Trump Tower.
[00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:08.682]  We're also looking at persistent allegations that the Russians have been laundering money through the Trump Organization.
[00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:10.164]  I don't know that that's true.
[00:02:10.164 --> 00:02:16.272]  How about if Robert Mueller comes back and says, definitively, we find no collusion by President Trump?
[00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:17.393]  Is that a conclusion you'll accept?
[00:02:18.274 --> 00:02:25.279]  Well we'd want to see the evidence behind that and see the validity of that and we could agree or disagree.
[00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:38.388]  Jerry Nadler announced that he will submit over 60 document requests to the White House and the Justice Department in a bid to keep the witch hunt going as Mueller's expectantly disappointing investigation comes to a close.
[00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:48.114]  And after former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's second round of embarrassing testimony served to allow Cohen to perjure himself yet again in front of Congress.
[00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:52.215]  Mr. Cohen, how long did you work in the White House?
[00:02:52.215 --> 00:02:53.775]  I never worked in the White House.
[00:02:53.775 --> 00:02:55.275]  That's the point, isn't it, Mr. Cohen?
[00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:55.816]  No, sir.
[00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:56.536]  Yes, it is.
[00:02:56.536 --> 00:02:57.216]  No, it's not, sir.
[00:02:57.216 --> 00:02:58.756]  You wanted to work in the White House.
[00:02:58.756 --> 00:02:59.076]  No, sir.
[00:02:59.076 --> 00:03:00.577]  You didn't get brought to the dance.
[00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:00.737]  Sir.
[00:03:00.737 --> 00:03:01.397]  And now?
[00:03:01.397 --> 00:03:08.978]  I was extremely proud to be personal attorney to the President of the United States of America.
[00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:11.159]  I did not want to go to the White House.
[00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.059]  Is there a chance that he'll ask me to go to Washington?
[00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.600]  Oh, there's absolutely a chance he's going to ask you to go.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.240]  Oh, I certainly hope so.
[00:03:17.628 --> 00:03:22.132]  A lot of what he said today, I think, bolstered his credibility.
[00:03:22.132 --> 00:03:25.795]  If he is such a confirmed liar, why didn't he say, Trump told me to lie?
[00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:26.576]  If he had said it,
[00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:45.511]  Trump would there be subject to the possible charge of subordination and perjury, but he didn't say it.
[00:03:45.511 --> 00:04:05.664]  Of course, when it comes to the investigation of the Clinton's mountain of evidence detailing Russian collusion, blatant threats to national security, the financial rape of Haiti, and even Bill Clinton's sick affair in the Oval Office that led to impeachment, Jerry Nadler could be counted on to steer any investigation off course.
[00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:06.885]  Well, you cannot let
[00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:16.449]  The actions of people who want to bring the government to a halt and concentrate only on politics and only on obstruction affect everything else.
[00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:28.372]  That's a very good reason to have a Democratic House and Senate, so we can get on with the government, with the business of the people, instead of wasting our time on all kinds of investigations that will ultimately go nowhere.
[00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:37.495]  You look at the entire Clinton presidency, Bill Clinton presidency, Whitewater, Travelgate, this gate, that gate, nothing went anywhere until you got the Monica Lewinsky thing that didn't even exist.
[00:04:38.035 --> 00:04:43.557]  Just how far Schiff and Nadler will overreach to satisfy a handful of Trump critics in the face of millions of Americans will become apparent in the coming weeks.
[00:05:00.473 --> 00:05:03.735]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:06.757]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[00:05:06.757 --> 00:05:13.621]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:14.762]  X2 is back.
[00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:15.543]  We got it.
[00:05:15.543 --> 00:05:17.224]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[00:05:17.224 --> 00:05:18.805]  We rushed it into production.
[00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:19.585]  It's been bottled.
[00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:25.349]  The labels are being put on today, and then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the
[00:05:25.549 --> 00:05:28.693]  Plant in the Rockies and it's going to be shipped out to you.
[00:05:28.693 --> 00:05:29.815]  Be sure and sign up for auto-ship.
[00:05:29.815 --> 00:05:31.997]  Get an additional 10% off.
[00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:36.643]  The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[00:05:36.643 --> 00:05:38.546]  Research the iodine conspiracy.
[00:05:38.546 --> 00:05:40.328]  Find out why it's so important.
[00:05:40.328 --> 00:05:42.150]  Find out what the globalists don't want you to have.
[00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:43.412]  Uh, the good halogens.
[00:05:43.412 --> 00:05:44.813]  Don't you have the bad halogens?
[00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:46.975]  At InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:48.196]  That's the umbrella site.
[00:05:48.196 --> 00:05:49.437]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:05:49.437 --> 00:05:50.978]  Takes you right to the supplements.
[00:05:50.978 --> 00:05:54.161]  And this is the King Daddy, uh, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:56.083]  It is X2 Original.
[00:05:56.083 --> 00:05:58.405]  Now back at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:20.462]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.462 --> 00:06:21.142]  Well, here we are.
[00:06:21.142 --> 00:06:22.703]  It's already Tuesday.
[00:06:22.703 --> 00:06:25.403]  It's amazing.
[00:06:25.403 --> 00:06:27.944]  Tuesday, March 5th, 2019.
[00:06:27.944 --> 00:06:32.805]  I am your host, Alex Jones, here in the new studio.
[00:06:32.805 --> 00:06:37.406]  You've seen us do a lot of live reports and had political coverage of big events.
[00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:47.787]  Like State of the Union here in our new state-of-the-art studio, we've got three nice studios here now and are ready to start expanding to about 20 hours a day live.
[00:06:47.787 --> 00:06:56.959]  We're about six months behind getting that done because of all the obvious globalist attempts to shut us down and block us, but we are moving forward thanks to your prayers and thanks to your support.
[00:06:57.771 --> 00:07:06.719]  And quite frankly, we are now reaching just as many people as we ever did after all the enemy's attempts to shut us down and shut us up.
[00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:07.980]  It has backfired.
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.981]  We achieved Streisand effect.
[00:07:09.981 --> 00:07:17.148]  And now we're reaching an even wider new audience thanks to this core audience of activists taking action.
[00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:24.167]  And I thought I'd celebrate the new studio today by wearing a Stetson Open Road cowboy hat, Silverbelly.
[00:07:24.167 --> 00:07:29.372]  This is the same hat my dad's dad wore his whole life, and I knew him.
[00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:33.416]  And I got reminded of these, that Paul Watson's here in town.
[00:07:33.416 --> 00:07:38.541]  And about, it was like 15 years ago, that Paul has a whole different personality when you put a cowboy hat on him.
[00:07:39.486 --> 00:07:44.329]  Uh, and so we're going to put a cowboy hat on him and get his great Texas, uh, imitation.
[00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:55.377]  Uh, but also a lot of other serious issues when he joins us at the waypoint at the midway point, halfway into the broadcast in about an hour and 23 minutes from now, Faith Goldie.
[00:07:55.377 --> 00:08:00.200]  It's also on fire, exposing the controlled globalists inside the Republican party.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.662]  One of the final obstacles to really defeating the NWO.
[00:08:03.662 --> 00:08:06.684]  She's going to be popping in and I tend to open the phones up as well.
[00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:09.026]  And then I will co-host the war room.
[00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:12.995]  With Owen Schroyer, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:13.416]  today.
[00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:16.178]  I will be on the second half with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:08:16.178 --> 00:08:17.980]  We're going to have open phones.
[00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.482]  And on Reddit, Ask Us Anything.
[00:08:20.482 --> 00:08:24.926]  I'm going to start a new system of Ask Me Anything, where you do it with two people.
[00:08:24.926 --> 00:08:30.450]  Two different people, and you ask two different interesting people questions, and they have a discussion, and they ask each other questions.
[00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:32.352]  That's something I'm going to start.
[00:08:32.352 --> 00:08:39.116]  I'm going to start a podcast soon titled, Ask Me Anything, where you have different guests on and you can ask them anything as well.
[00:08:39.116 --> 00:08:42.818]  So a lot of stuff about to happen here at InfoWars.
[00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:50.563]  Thanks to your prayers, thanks to your support, thanks to everything you do, and thanks to all the great AM and FM affiliates and TV affiliates as well if you're listening to one of those.
[00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:55.987]  Please be sure and spread the word about those five stations and support them.
[00:08:55.987 --> 00:08:56.347]  Okay!
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.586]  You know, I talked about this a couple years ago when they passed the law.
[00:09:02.586 --> 00:09:07.013]  And they always pass draconian laws where they come into effect in a few years.
[00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.634]  Show that the public doesn't oppose them.
[00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.175]  People are very short-sighted.
[00:09:13.175 --> 00:09:15.297]  They're thinking in the moment, not long-term.
[00:09:15.297 --> 00:09:18.321]  But exactly as we said they would do it, they've done it.
[00:09:18.321 --> 00:09:21.244]  And if you sit back and think, how would you take over the Internet?
[00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:23.707]  How would you trick people to openly be surveilled?
[00:09:23.707 --> 00:09:29.072]  How would you trick people to be taxed to use the Internet more than they even do in Communist China?
[00:09:29.813 --> 00:09:30.593]  How would you do that?
[00:09:30.593 --> 00:09:54.865]  Well, when you saw Pornhub and a couple of these other major sites that get billions of views a month together, at the heart of UN meetings and meetings with ICANN and meetings with Big Tech about how they were going to battle trafficking in humans and how they were going to empower women, you knew it was bad.
[00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:58.567]  So they signed on to ban free porn.
[00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:10.248]  Now their sites will still be a mix of paid and quote free, but of course if they've got more than half the porn market, they want to be able to shut everybody else down.
[00:10:10.248 --> 00:10:20.471]  It's not about porn though, they know that it will get conservatives and Christians on board, and just like the British government, it's the only government in the world that has a paid television tax.
[00:10:20.471 --> 00:10:22.272]  Even if you don't own a television, they tax you.
[00:10:23.277 --> 00:10:24.898]  What is up to a thousand pounds a year.
[00:10:24.898 --> 00:10:34.141]  It's an outrageous amount of money and they even have vans that drive around because any receiver also transmits a tiny transmission.
[00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:35.802]  Any receiver is also a transceiver.
[00:10:35.802 --> 00:10:43.844]  So they have vans that drive around with people picking up if you're watching television, not just BBC, but television period.
[00:10:43.844 --> 00:10:47.726]  So there's a government tax to then fund propaganda.
[00:10:48.593 --> 00:10:49.473]  And that's what this is.
[00:10:49.473 --> 00:10:51.434]  So people think of the UK as such a free country.
[00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:54.635]  It's an outrageously unfree country.
[00:10:54.635 --> 00:10:56.676]  And so I'm going to break that down today in great detail.
[00:10:56.676 --> 00:11:00.817]  I'll apologize for watching on from the UK in studio to give a systec on it.
[00:11:00.817 --> 00:11:06.199]  But you see the DrugsReport.com headline, the headlines on Infowars.com as well.
[00:11:06.199 --> 00:11:12.141]  UK blocks all porn that's free or free porn blocked.
[00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:14.221]  Free porn blocked in the UK.
[00:11:14.221 --> 00:11:15.362]  You go to Infowars.com
[00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:29.064]  And we have the headline that the national move in the UK to ban, quote, free porn is really an internet tax and internet tracking system.
[00:11:29.064 --> 00:11:31.705]  So this is it.
[00:11:31.705 --> 00:11:33.225]  This is the plan.
[00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:38.806]  And I told folks a couple of years ago, when they were talking about it, that this is what's being implemented.
[00:11:38.806 --> 00:11:42.687]  But it's sold as just, oh, you pay the government.
[00:11:43.874 --> 00:11:50.956]  And then they put software on your computer that watches what you do, and you give them your ID or passport, and now you can go look at any porn you want.
[00:11:50.956 --> 00:11:52.856]  So I'm going to say that again.
[00:11:52.856 --> 00:12:03.459]  The government is going to have a dossier, they already do, but publicly you're going to opt into a dossier that knows what porn you're watching.
[00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:11.181]  So you and your wife, it's Saturday night, you go in, you turn on the television, you dial into the internet, and you pull up whatever your wife's into.
[00:12:11.181 --> 00:12:11.861]  That's how it works.
[00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:18.732]  And now that you've got another partner in the bedroom with you, it's called the British government.
[00:12:18.732 --> 00:12:20.592]  But understand, it's coming here.
[00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:21.953]  This is the model.
[00:12:21.953 --> 00:12:25.134]  Everything done in China and England and Europe is the model.
[00:12:25.134 --> 00:12:29.835]  And they even admit in the articles, they're like, this is for, to make sure children don't look at it.
[00:12:29.835 --> 00:12:32.536]  And this is to make sure we keep everybody safe.
[00:12:32.536 --> 00:12:35.317]  And this is to make sure we can stop people being exploited.
[00:12:35.317 --> 00:12:36.297]  All that's made up.
[00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:39.018]  The UN's running the kidnapping rings, all of it.
[00:12:39.398 --> 00:12:50.132]  The porn industry, for anything you can say about it, I don't even defend it, it's very exploitive, has basically cleaned up its act under lawsuits and disease and it's very exploitive and evil and I'm not defending it.
[00:12:50.132 --> 00:12:50.873]  But any claims...
[00:12:51.738 --> 00:12:57.464]  That the government of the UK or the US government or anybody trying to defend kids from porn is asinine.
[00:12:57.464 --> 00:12:59.746]  Because I've got stories right here in my stack.
[00:12:59.746 --> 00:13:02.229]  Aggressive promotion of homosexuality.
[00:13:02.229 --> 00:13:07.854]  School stops LGBT lesson after backlash from angry parents.
[00:13:07.854 --> 00:13:10.657]  It's being reported by the Daily Mail, by RT and others.
[00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:11.858]  And you learn it's Muslims.
[00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:15.562]  So say what you want about Muslims who throw gays off buildings and cut women's genitals off.
[00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:17.825]  I disagree with that.
[00:13:17.825 --> 00:13:19.187]  I'm a libertarian.
[00:13:19.187 --> 00:13:22.771]  But I don't think you should have LGBTP sexualizing kids.
[00:13:22.771 --> 00:13:25.535]  That's the pedophile side of that.
[00:13:25.535 --> 00:13:27.658]  Some groups are officially adopting the P now.
[00:13:27.658 --> 00:13:29.160]  They're saying, yes, we are pedophilia.
[00:13:31.371 --> 00:13:33.533]  That was in the Congressional Report five years ago.
[00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:35.115]  The Democrats wanted all this.
[00:13:35.115 --> 00:13:36.316]  The same thing's happening in the UK.
[00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.057]  It's a unified, concerted effort.
[00:13:38.057 --> 00:13:39.959]  So they're sexualizing children.
[00:13:39.959 --> 00:13:42.301]  They've got drag kid things at school.
[00:13:42.301 --> 00:13:45.945]  They have drag queens coming in and telling your five-year-old son that they're really a girl.
[00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:47.746]  I mean, if that happened at the park, you'd go to jail.
[00:13:47.746 --> 00:13:55.714]  If a man walked over at the park while you're sitting there grilling hamburgers and said, I'm going to teach your daughter and your son about sex, they'd be arrested as being a pervert.
[00:13:56.374 --> 00:13:58.456]  But now that it's done officially by the school, it's okay.
[00:13:58.456 --> 00:14:04.882]  So, meanwhile, just today, you've got massive arrests of giant Islamic grooming gangs of little girls.
[00:14:04.882 --> 00:14:09.426]  And then you've got the leftist allied with radical Islam saying, come on in, do whatever you want.
[00:14:09.426 --> 00:14:13.589]  But now the Muslims are saying, hey, I'm going to teach my five-year-old how to give a blowjob.
[00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:15.631]  It's what they teach in UK schools.
[00:14:15.631 --> 00:14:17.533]  Or that he's going to put a dress on him.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:24.465]  And so now the left's saying, it's okay, Muslims can opt out, but no one else can, and you'll be arrested if you're not a Muslim.
[00:14:24.465 --> 00:14:27.168]  So see, this is how the whole leftist system works.
[00:14:27.168 --> 00:14:29.089]  Total and complete tyranny.
[00:14:29.089 --> 00:14:34.694]  So, when the UK, quote, blocks porn that is, quote, free, what they're saying is...
[00:14:35.595 --> 00:14:43.738]  The tens of thousands of other sites, or now they're even going to go Puritan on you, Puritanical, and say even showing breast.
[00:14:43.738 --> 00:14:45.918]  ShoffCore is now regulated.
[00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:50.680]  So now if you want to watch an R-rated movie, you're going to have to opt into a government database and agree to be tracked.
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.701]  That's the secret of the global social credit score, to get you to opt in.
[00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.288]  It's outrageous.
[00:14:56.288 --> 00:15:09.513]  So all the other sites can be shut down, all the other sites can be blocked, and only the two big porn sites that account for half the porn visits in the world, well of course they're for this, PornHub and YouPorn.
[00:15:09.513 --> 00:15:20.758]  Now, now because this is much bigger than all the TV networks and all the media in the world combined, it's now going to be regulated and turned into one homogenized controlled combine.
[00:15:22.142 --> 00:15:23.743]  Which is what it's always been about.
[00:15:23.743 --> 00:15:25.185]  That's what internet regulation is about.
[00:15:25.185 --> 00:15:29.849]  The attacks on talk radio, the attacks on Alex Jones, the attacks on free speech.
[00:15:29.849 --> 00:15:32.371]  Because once they can ban me, they can ban you.
[00:15:32.371 --> 00:15:43.440]  And once they can say, oh, you have a government device and software, it watches what porn you're watching and you pay a government license to go watch pornography from around the world.
[00:15:44.537 --> 00:15:45.299]  Think about that.
[00:15:45.299 --> 00:15:47.543]  That is so diabolical and so evil.
[00:15:47.543 --> 00:15:56.158]  That's the left doing it in the name of protecting children when they're the ones that are a bunch of pedophilic perverts trying to get a hold of your kids and literally teach them how to be perverts.
[00:15:56.158 --> 00:15:56.799]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:56.799 --> 00:15:57.139]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.512 --> 00:16:00.373]  Maybe not today.
[00:16:00.373 --> 00:16:02.073]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:16:02.073 --> 00:16:05.815]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:16:05.815 --> 00:16:06.896]  Forget bunkers.
[00:16:06.896 --> 00:16:08.717]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:16:08.717 --> 00:16:10.418]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.384]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:31.384 --> 00:16:36.688]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:38.290]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:46.636]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:17:28.451 --> 00:17:34.796]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.796 --> 00:17:37.838]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.838 --> 00:17:43.763]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.763 --> 00:17:47.566]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:48.827]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.827 --> 00:17:50.168]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.168 --> 00:17:56.373]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.373 --> 00:17:57.814]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:18.627]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:18:18.627 --> 00:18:28.710]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[00:18:42.555 --> 00:18:47.598]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you like.
[00:18:47.598 --> 00:18:49.099]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:50.580]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:57.265]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[00:20:02.871 --> 00:20:21.641]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:21.641 --> 00:20:27.824]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:47.722 --> 00:20:53.868]  I didn't tell you I was going on Joe Rogan.
[00:20:53.868 --> 00:20:56.110]  We just snuck attacked.
[00:20:56.110 --> 00:21:01.134]  And I can tell you there's a bunch of other sneak attacks coming very soon just as big.
[00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:01.515]  Or bigger.
[00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:03.680]  Talked to Joe Sum this morning.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:09.085]  It is undoubtedly, with analytics, the biggest podcast he's ever done.
[00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:10.886]  And the last one I did was number three.
[00:21:10.886 --> 00:21:12.848]  It was number one until Elon Musk and a few others.
[00:21:12.848 --> 00:21:18.052]  Now it's number one only six days in.
[00:21:18.052 --> 00:21:25.138]  In fact, we're expecting by tomorrow night it will have at least 30 million views between YouTube and iTunes.
[00:21:25.138 --> 00:21:27.320]  Right now it's over 20 million total.
[00:21:28.445 --> 00:21:31.227]  And that's with Google not letting it trend and blocking it.
[00:21:31.227 --> 00:21:31.788]  Remember that.
[00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:33.789]  Now, let me make the big announcement here.
[00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:36.312]  Okay?
[00:21:36.312 --> 00:21:47.701]  Internet ID... Let me make the big announcement here.
[00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:55.127]  Internet ID... Internet Regulation, Internet Tracking is here.
[00:21:57.054 --> 00:22:03.177]  And it's being done under the auspice of, quote, blocking free porn.
[00:22:03.177 --> 00:22:16.362]  The UK has now passed law that has implemented, April 1st, that only the two big porn companies, PornHub and YouPorn, will be the only sites you can visit.
[00:22:16.362 --> 00:22:24.586]  Everything else, you've got to go through a government database, give them a passport or an ID, log into a government database, so they can track what you do, and then pay them money
[00:22:26.164 --> 00:22:29.126]  So that you have the right to go look at pornography.
[00:22:29.126 --> 00:22:42.197]  So just like George Orwell predicted in 1984, the government is going to be in charge of pornography for control and debasement of the population.
[00:22:42.197 --> 00:22:44.619]  This has nothing to do with stopping pornography.
[00:22:44.619 --> 00:22:46.941]  It has nothing to do with stopping the targeting of children.
[00:22:46.941 --> 00:22:48.442]  It's mainstream media.
[00:22:48.442 --> 00:22:49.323]  It's cartoons.
[00:22:49.323 --> 00:22:50.784]  It's the public schools.
[00:22:50.784 --> 00:22:51.645]  It's all of them.
[00:22:52.605 --> 00:22:58.328]  That are totally and completely obsessed with sexualizing children.
[00:22:58.328 --> 00:23:07.874]  And now that the government is going to be involved with all these fact-checking groups and leftist groups like Hope Not Hate and the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:23:09.517 --> 00:23:11.259]  And media matters.
[00:23:11.259 --> 00:23:16.503]  They're going to be in the history of the supposed porn you're visiting.
[00:23:16.503 --> 00:23:19.305]  And don't think this is just going to end in the UK.
[00:23:19.305 --> 00:23:23.969]  They admit with the major porn companies who want their competition shut down.
[00:23:23.969 --> 00:23:25.290]  This is total racketeering.
[00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.392]  This is total antitrust.
[00:23:28.392 --> 00:23:31.555]  They admit that they want their competition shut down.
[00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:38.741]  So they're partnering with government to control and track who looks at porn webcams.
[00:23:39.847 --> 00:23:47.291]  What movies you watch, what you do, and even softcore pornography will now be tracked in a government database.
[00:23:47.291 --> 00:23:56.236]  Think about how the IRS abused tens of thousands of Christians and conservatives and libertarians under Obama and no one got in trouble with Loris Lerner.
[00:23:56.236 --> 00:24:07.963]  Think about all the incredible abuses they've been involved with with the databases and leftist doxing people and using where you live and where you go to school and where you work to get you fired if you're a Trump supporter.
[00:24:09.175 --> 00:24:21.505]  And then imagine, you gotta take your hat off to them to come up with something like this, that they would try to get away with this in 2019, and then just, oh, it's just a law to protect kids, boop!
[00:24:21.505 --> 00:24:37.317]  You gotta pay a government fee, you've got to then be tracked, and then the government, of course, can easily go in anytime they want, and they can add whatever disinformation they want to the database of supposed porn that you visited.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:45.587]  Because in blackmail and control, people's sexual proclivity, people's sexual activity are their big, dark secrets.
[00:24:45.587 --> 00:24:57.738]  And now the UK government, the kings of blackmail, the kings of pedophilia, the kings of using sex to control populations and governments, are now saying, oh, by the way, you visit any major porn site,
[00:24:59.998 --> 00:25:01.600]  You've got to have a government license.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.802]  You've got to give us your ID.
[00:25:02.802 --> 00:25:04.164]  You've got to be in a database.
[00:25:04.164 --> 00:25:13.256]  You've got to have our software on your computer that will have trusted groups like Hope Not Hate and the Southern Poverty Law Center and others inside your computer.
[00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:16.020]  George Soros funded groups just like NewsGuard.
[00:25:16.917 --> 00:25:20.798]  It's now on all the Microsoft operating systems and browsers.
[00:25:20.798 --> 00:25:27.120]  And it's going to move on, they're saying, the next few months to Apple and to Google and to Android and to the phones.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:35.163]  And then now, when you visit a site, it's not going to be on the site that, oh, don't listen to Alex Jones, here's some fact-checking.
[00:25:35.703 --> 00:25:39.065]  Where they then misrepresent what we've said and done, and then fact check the straw man.
[00:25:39.065 --> 00:25:40.506]  No, it's on your phone.
[00:25:40.506 --> 00:25:41.747]  It's on your desktop.
[00:25:41.747 --> 00:25:43.008]  They're in your phone.
[00:25:43.008 --> 00:25:50.733]  They're in your desktop watching what you do in real time, telling you, oh, this is dangerous, or oh, this is bad, or oh, you could have your credit score lowered.
[00:25:50.733 --> 00:25:51.693]  You could get in trouble.
[00:25:51.693 --> 00:25:54.395]  You're looking at illegal content.
[00:25:54.395 --> 00:25:55.536]  So it's multi-pronged.
[00:25:55.536 --> 00:26:03.321]  They've got the leftist fact checkers in the universities, and the intelligence agencies already plugged into Microsoft, and looking at what you're saying, and looking at what you're doing.
[00:26:06.345 --> 00:26:09.608]  And the neocons run News Garden.
[00:26:09.608 --> 00:26:17.695]  And then you've got over here the left going, oh, no one wants to pay their BBC fee anymore of a thousand pounds a year or whatever it is.
[00:26:17.695 --> 00:26:22.479]  Look up what the BBC yearly charge is.
[00:26:22.479 --> 00:26:23.980]  Look that up for me real quick.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:32.007]  Look up the BBC yearly charge for me, because I want to get that looked at right now.
[00:26:32.007 --> 00:26:32.668]  I want to do that.
[00:26:33.686 --> 00:26:40.913]  So imagine, they started this back in the 40s after World War II, and they said, everybody that has a television, you've got to pay a tax.
[00:26:40.913 --> 00:26:45.938]  And then even if you didn't have a television, they said, well you may be looking at your neighbor's TV, so you're going to pay this big giant tax.
[00:26:46.923 --> 00:26:49.125]  Yeah, it used to be up to a thousand pounds, but now no one would pay us.
[00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:53.228]  They lowered it to 147 to 150 pounds.
[00:26:53.228 --> 00:26:54.168]  So what is that?
[00:26:54.168 --> 00:26:55.570]  Two hundred and something dollars a year.
[00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:58.312]  But again, the key here isn't the money.
[00:26:58.312 --> 00:26:59.172]  It's with the Internet.
[00:26:59.172 --> 00:27:05.837]  They can track what you're looking at and what you're doing, and they think the subservient client population will accept it.
[00:27:05.837 --> 00:27:07.258]  But here's where it gets worse.
[00:27:07.258 --> 00:27:10.721]  Now it turns loose the taxing authority.
[00:27:10.721 --> 00:27:14.464]  They have their IRS over there by another name.
[00:27:16.425 --> 00:27:23.492]  But they're inland revenue, inside the empire revenue, and now they're going to have an excuse to raid you!
[00:27:23.492 --> 00:27:29.058]  To see that you were looking at porn that wasn't authorized and wasn't put through a government filter.
[00:27:29.058 --> 00:27:30.099]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:27:30.099 --> 00:27:32.382]  The government is going to run worldwide
[00:27:33.118 --> 00:27:35.999]  The production and the distribution, because that's how this works.
[00:27:35.999 --> 00:27:42.662]  Once you take control of the regulatory power of something, you will then inevitably become the producer, the director, you will be the person making the money.
[00:27:42.662 --> 00:27:50.526]  So governments are now always horning in on Hollywood and the theater and entertainment and having a merger of that in any fascist or communist system.
[00:27:50.746 --> 00:28:04.913]  But now they'll be directly in control of pornography, and the top pornography producers are all lined up as suitors to government because the internet decentralized porn and took the money out of it.
[00:28:04.913 --> 00:28:16.058]  All the way now to the only way you make money in porn, if you read the expert analysis, is individual-to-individual like prostitution, where women and men are doing webcams and giving people personal attention.
[00:28:16.849 --> 00:28:21.350]  So it's evolved or devolved now back to closer to real sex.
[00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.891]  Away from the big cookie cutter mass production of the 1960s and 1970s.
[00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:30.212]  Where there were porn movies making as much money as major Hollywood movies.
[00:28:30.212 --> 00:28:31.793]  Tens of millions of dollars.
[00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:34.033]  That's all decentralized and destroyed.
[00:28:34.033 --> 00:28:35.474]  So now you have the perfect storm.
[00:28:36.434 --> 00:28:52.685]  Now you have the perfect storm of the big porn companies collapsing, government wanting to know what you're watching and doing, global government, internet ID, global social score coming together, and England, the UK, is the launch point for total surveillance of everything, and it's coming here, make no mistake.
[00:28:52.685 --> 00:28:57.288]  When we return, Google just got caught lying about Dragonfly and mass spying!
[00:28:59.329 --> 00:29:04.311]  Number one international best-selling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[00:29:04.311 --> 00:29:09.592]  Lyme disease bankrupt him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family.
[00:29:09.592 --> 00:29:18.435]  After building a seven-figure business from his couch, God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[00:29:18.875 --> 00:29:21.499]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.
[00:29:21.499 --> 00:29:26.305]  It's the Babylonian system and you have to escape it before it's too late.
[00:29:26.305 --> 00:29:29.348]  Haven't you ever wanted to wake up from this nightmare?
[00:29:29.348 --> 00:29:36.117]  Matthew David's free quick study guide shows you what to do today to build lasting wealth in any economy.
[00:29:36.377 --> 00:29:37.998]  I've got some really good news though.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.121]  X2's back.
[00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:05.882]  The original X2.
[00:30:05.882 --> 00:30:08.783]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[00:30:08.783 --> 00:30:09.884]  What you want.
[00:30:09.884 --> 00:30:11.004]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:11.004 --> 00:30:12.425]  It'll be here in a week.
[00:30:12.425 --> 00:30:13.986]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[00:30:13.986 --> 00:30:14.946]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:14.946 --> 00:30:16.747]  With the best iodine in the world.
[00:30:16.747 --> 00:30:17.888]  X2, it's available.
[00:30:17.888 --> 00:30:18.888]  I thought X3's great.
[00:30:18.888 --> 00:30:21.089]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[00:30:21.089 --> 00:30:22.910]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.251]  The scientists that do that.
[00:30:24.251 --> 00:30:26.072]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[00:30:26.912 --> 00:30:31.274]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[00:30:31.274 --> 00:30:35.377]  We now have X2 again, and InfoWarsTore.com, so hallelujah.
[00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:47.063]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[00:30:47.063 --> 00:30:55.668]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[00:31:59.977 --> 00:32:05.421]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:32:05.421 --> 00:32:07.202]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:32:07.202 --> 00:32:08.963]  Now I can be there for my children.
[00:32:08.963 --> 00:32:10.804]  Now I can make them strong.
[00:32:10.804 --> 00:32:12.445]  Now I can instruct them.
[00:32:12.445 --> 00:32:15.147]  Now I can teach them what I've learned, but not once I'm gone.
[00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:20.390]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:25.994]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:32:25.994 --> 00:32:29.637]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:32:29.637 --> 00:32:34.600]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:41.505]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[00:32:41.505 --> 00:32:45.167]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:52.895]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:32:52.895 --> 00:33:03.886]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:33:03.886 --> 00:33:06.489]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.968 --> 00:33:16.132]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[00:33:16.132 --> 00:33:31.745]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:31.745 --> 00:33:39.692]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events,
[00:33:39.992 --> 00:33:43.796]  And exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[00:33:43.796 --> 00:33:54.225]  While the old guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape rocked by innovation and technology, InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[00:33:54.225 --> 00:34:05.595]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[00:34:06.816 --> 00:34:16.304]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[00:34:16.304 --> 00:34:17.625]  Demand truth.
[00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:21.068]  Demand InfoWars.
[00:34:21.068 --> 00:34:22.169]  InfoWars.
[00:34:22.169 --> 00:34:23.670]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:10.796]  So in 2017, we have states passing laws to kill babies that are totally healthy and already outside the womb.
[00:35:10.796 --> 00:35:19.501]  In 2019, they're teaching five-year-olds and four-year-olds in the UK and Canada and the US that little boys are really little girls and little girls are really little boys.
[00:35:19.501 --> 00:35:25.024]  Serious psychological abuse beyond sexual abuse, trying to literally destroy their identity.
[00:35:26.078 --> 00:35:28.180]  Something that if parents did it, they should be arrested.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.662]  But the school does it, it's okay.
[00:35:31.662 --> 00:35:44.571]  And now, UK Porn Block starts April 1st, but you can unlock it by handing over ID or buying a £5 porn card.
[00:35:44.571 --> 00:35:47.153]  So you pay like $7.
[00:35:47.153 --> 00:35:55.579]  And then the government tracks everything you do and has your ID and your name.
[00:35:57.637 --> 00:35:59.979]  And the government knows what you're watching and what you're doing.
[00:35:59.979 --> 00:36:01.000]  This is so creepy.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.781]  This is so sick.
[00:36:01.781 --> 00:36:03.823]  The government is now a voyeur.
[00:36:03.823 --> 00:36:05.525]  A pimp in your bedroom.
[00:36:05.525 --> 00:36:08.828]  And of course it comes from the left.
[00:36:08.828 --> 00:36:12.091]  To protect the children, of course.
[00:36:12.091 --> 00:36:20.200]  Watching free porn in Britain is about to get a lot trickier thanks to new rules that aim to protect children from online smut.
[00:36:21.007 --> 00:36:22.708]  Yeah, we don't want kids to be hateful bigots.
[00:36:22.708 --> 00:36:24.189]  Let's teach them to be sexualized at age 5.
[00:36:24.189 --> 00:36:27.231]  They used to be called pedophilia, now it's called liberal.
[00:36:27.231 --> 00:36:35.035]  As early as next month, porn sites will be required to get proof of ID from UK residents before showing any X-rated clips.
[00:36:35.035 --> 00:36:40.599]  Includes free porn sites like Pornhub and YouPorn, who don't want there to be competition and want you to have to register.
[00:36:41.618 --> 00:36:48.407]  Which attract nearly 2 billion visits a month between them worldwide, and know they're going to make 100 times more money with the government who they lobbied to do this.
[00:36:48.407 --> 00:36:51.691]  That's right, the big porn sites did this to create a monopoly.
[00:36:52.850 --> 00:37:02.275]  Bill's run a number of other sites and using Age ID system, which requires users to verify their age via an official form of ID, which is his driver's license or passport.
[00:37:02.275 --> 00:37:10.359]  So you're not getting into a hotel or passing a port, you're going to go watch whatever and now the government's going to be there with a record of it.
[00:37:10.359 --> 00:37:20.485]  From April, when the new system is expected to launch, Randy Internet Lurkers will be shown a non-pornographic landing page, according to Age ID spokesman James Clark.
[00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:34.255]  When a user first visits a site protected by Age ID, a landing page will appear with a prompt for the user to verify their age before they can access the site, he told the Metro.
[00:37:34.255 --> 00:37:37.656]  Each website will create their own non-pornographic landing page.
[00:37:37.656 --> 00:37:46.560]  When someone first clicks the site, they'll be asked to register with Age ID to verify their age using a mobile SMZM's credit card or passport or driver's license.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.882]  This is the Internet ID, Internet taxation, Internet regulation.
[00:37:50.752 --> 00:38:02.975]  Users will then be able to use the HID username or password attached to your driver's license, your passport, the government has, to access all porn sites that use HID, although some may use different verification systems.
[00:38:02.975 --> 00:38:08.696]  Clark said it's a one-time verification with a simple sign-in for future access.
[00:38:08.696 --> 00:38:17.017]  If a user verifies with a HID-protected site, they'll not need to perform the verification age or any other site carrying HID.
[00:38:17.017 --> 00:38:19.458]  And again, this is going to be used against everybody else to shut them down.
[00:38:20.765 --> 00:38:24.467]  This is the Global ID, folks, the Global Internet ID, the Holy Grail of Surveillance and Control.
[00:38:24.467 --> 00:38:28.969]  The new rules were approved as part of the Digital Economy Act two years ago.
[00:38:28.969 --> 00:38:32.391]  They aim to make it harder for under 18s to get a hold of adult material.
[00:38:32.391 --> 00:38:34.092]  No, that's going on the schools.
[00:38:34.092 --> 00:38:41.576]  As well as registering with Age ID, Brits will also be able to access porn sites using a voucher you can buy from high street shops.
[00:38:41.576 --> 00:38:42.636]  Isn't that nice?
[00:38:42.636 --> 00:38:47.419]  Thousands of shops will offer the special IDs which users can link to an app known as Portals.
[00:38:49.346 --> 00:38:53.280]  And then it goes on to say you can also buy a government ID and go to the government system.
[00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.111]  So there you go, and it's all tracked by the government.
[00:38:57.111 --> 00:38:58.451]  So they got you to opt in.
[00:38:58.451 --> 00:38:59.992]  Like, the government's not spying.
[00:38:59.992 --> 00:39:01.493]  Okay, they are, but you know what?
[00:39:01.493 --> 00:39:03.953]  We just need you to opt in so we can do it.
[00:39:03.953 --> 00:39:08.495]  Because it's illegal to spy on you, but now we're going to do it openly.
[00:39:08.495 --> 00:39:11.116]  And then meanwhile, I mentioned this article earlier.
[00:39:11.116 --> 00:39:20.240]  Aggressive promotion of homosexuality, called pedophilia among the darker kids, school stops LGBT lessons after backlash from angry parents.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:23.401]  And when you read the articles in RT or the Daily Mail,
[00:39:24.421 --> 00:39:25.822]  It's, oh, it's Muslims.
[00:39:25.822 --> 00:39:31.666]  They're upset that there's grown adults talking to their five-year-old sons and daughters about their sexual preference.
[00:39:31.666 --> 00:39:33.026]  Because kids aren't thinking about that.
[00:39:33.026 --> 00:39:35.348]  I mean, if a dad or mom started asking their five-year-old about...
[00:39:36.892 --> 00:39:39.293]  Have you heard about sadomasochism?
[00:39:39.293 --> 00:39:41.554]  Have you heard about sex changes in children?
[00:39:41.554 --> 00:39:43.015]  Have you heard about fisting?
[00:39:43.015 --> 00:39:44.656]  This is what they teach five-year-olds.
[00:39:44.656 --> 00:39:45.957]  The kids are like, what?
[00:39:45.957 --> 00:39:48.578]  And you're just totally screwing them up.
[00:39:48.578 --> 00:39:51.120]  I mean, it's irrevocable pedophilic assault.
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:55.182]  But it's all done by the leftist social engineers, so it's all A-OK.
[00:39:56.246 --> 00:39:56.987]  And it continues.
[00:39:56.987 --> 00:40:00.991]  School forced in LGBT lessons by outraged Muslim parents.
[00:40:00.991 --> 00:40:04.114]  So, yeah, the pedophiles are worse than even orthodox Islam.
[00:40:04.114 --> 00:40:06.856]  Even though there's a lot of pedophilia in Islam.
[00:40:06.856 --> 00:40:12.501]  A primary school in Birmingham, England has halted LGBT lessons for 600 victims.
[00:40:12.501 --> 00:40:13.863]  They call them pupils.
[00:40:13.863 --> 00:40:20.529]  Were reportedly taken out of class by furious Muslim parents upset at homosexuals being aggressively taught to their children.
[00:40:20.529 --> 00:40:21.090]  Homosexuality.
[00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:22.487]  I don't know.
[00:40:40.848 --> 00:40:51.294]  Feeling from angry parents was even boiled over into threats against the assistant headteacher, Andrew Moffitt, MBA, who is gay.
[00:40:51.294 --> 00:40:57.377]  He claims to have received nasty emails, including one which he said wouldn't last too long.
[00:40:58.772 --> 00:41:00.093]  And it goes on from there.
[00:41:00.093 --> 00:41:05.678]  The primary school, which is around 720 victims, is located in the predominantly Muslim area.
[00:41:05.678 --> 00:41:14.925]  It has come under fire from Muslim parents for implementing the LGBT program, which seeks to challenge homophobia because homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam.
[00:41:14.925 --> 00:41:25.934]  According to Alum Rock Community Forum, children were removed from classes over the school's undermining of parental rights and aggressively promoting homosexuality, which is the total goal.
[00:41:26.414 --> 00:41:37.270]  The forum added that despite repeated petitions, protests, and dialogue integrated by parents, they have been arrogantly ignored because the pedophile can't control themselves.
[00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:42.738]  They will have their way with children until you lock them up or until they are executed.
[00:41:44.838 --> 00:41:46.900]  Remember when they used to be radical to say execute pedophiles?
[00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:49.081]  Now it's like, those are good people.
[00:41:49.081 --> 00:41:50.302]  Don't you try to do that.
[00:41:50.302 --> 00:41:52.404]  Actually, we can't allow that to go on.
[00:41:52.404 --> 00:41:59.009]  So, they're not trying to protect children in the pedophile-run, demonic command base of the United Kingdom.
[00:41:59.969 --> 00:42:07.572]  They are using what they've already done to then come in and try to get their mittens on everybody else's sexual activity or porn viewing.
[00:42:07.572 --> 00:42:08.412]  They already have it.
[00:42:08.412 --> 00:42:10.193]  They want to use it.
[00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:18.496]  They just want to legitimize that you opted into this and then demonize anybody else that doesn't sign up with the government to tell them where they went and what they did.
[00:42:18.496 --> 00:42:22.638]  They're training you to opt in to your own slavery.
[00:42:22.638 --> 00:42:27.099]  Now I think I've spent enough time on that, haven't I?
[00:42:27.099 --> 00:42:27.960]  So when we come back,
[00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:32.512]  Fountain of Youth, scientists switch off gene to double lifespan.
[00:42:32.512 --> 00:42:33.273]  Also, U.S.
[00:42:33.273 --> 00:42:37.615]  deaths from alcohol, drugs, and suicide at the highest levels ever recorded.
[00:42:37.615 --> 00:42:39.055]  And we're going to get into the big news.
[00:42:39.055 --> 00:42:40.736]  AOC.
[00:42:40.736 --> 00:42:44.397]  Vanessa D'Souza went to prison for $27,000, they said was illegal.
[00:42:44.397 --> 00:42:46.218]  He gave to a friend running for the Senate.
[00:42:46.218 --> 00:42:54.582]  But in the very same state and very same district, they're saying AOC raised $18 million, most of it illegal, can keep the millions.
[00:42:54.582 --> 00:42:56.522]  That's right, she's above the law.
[00:42:56.522 --> 00:42:57.783]  She's a good, dirty commie.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:12.931]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:43:12.931 --> 00:43:23.980]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:43:25.283 --> 00:43:27.211]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:43:27.211 --> 00:43:29.884]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.562]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:43:35.562 --> 00:43:39.825]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:43:39.825 --> 00:43:42.106]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:43:42.106 --> 00:43:44.427]  This country is in a war!
[00:43:44.427 --> 00:43:55.133]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.

[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:13.363 --> 00:47:38.496]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:38.496 --> 00:47:41.978]  Well, I'm going to say it right now on air.
[00:47:44.736 --> 00:48:09.767]  I take my hat off to the Islamic Muslim community of the UK because they're the only groups consistently protesting and saying no to children as young as three years of age being taught that they're sexually active, that boys are girls, that girls are boys, and they've been protesting and saying no to the pedophile cult that runs the UK.
[00:48:09.767 --> 00:48:10.687]  And so I salute
[00:48:13.581 --> 00:48:22.124]  The Muslims in the UK for being better people than the average British citizen and better than the police and better than the government that's run by pedophiles.
[00:48:22.124 --> 00:48:29.926]  Because as bad as radical Islam is and as bad as the horrible things you do are and your grooming gangs and all the rest of it, you're at least saying, let's just kidnap...
[00:48:30.886 --> 00:48:33.307]  13 year old girls and turn them into sex slaves, which is terrible.
[00:48:33.307 --> 00:48:38.210]  But you're not saying let's teach 3, 4, and 5 year olds the same stuff.
[00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:45.174]  So in the whole spectrum of evil in the UK, I have to say radical Islam and the Muslims are now better.
[00:48:46.223 --> 00:49:02.269]  And we just covered that in the last segment, how they are radically brainwashing children, how they're telling boys they're really girls, girls are really boys, they're sexualizing them, they're abusing them, it's pedophilia, and the Muslims have come out and said it's wrong, and are the people standing up.
[00:49:02.269 --> 00:49:12.853]  And I know there's been the golden age of Islam, and I know there's been Islamic countries and nations that were actually open and free during different parts of civilization, but the current one run by the Al-Qaeda, Wahhabi of Saudi Arabia is pure evil.
[00:49:13.632 --> 00:49:21.174]  But I would welcome Islam to reform itself and then team up with the West to try to stand up against satanic activity.
[00:49:21.174 --> 00:49:34.677]  But right now the Left is in love with Islam because they think you're against Christianity, so they've made a deal with you, but now the Left doesn't know what to do because Islam is standing in the way of the Left perverting five-year-old children.
[00:49:35.649 --> 00:49:53.013]  So this is quite a conundrum, quite a paradox that we're going to be discussing, but I take my hat off to the Muslims of the UK, out of a giant, rotting, filthy, capitulated, passed out, submissive, demonic, drunken island.
[00:49:53.013 --> 00:49:56.553]  Of all the rotten parts of the fish, I guess you're the least rotten.
[00:49:56.553 --> 00:50:01.154]  I have to say it, maybe the UK will be liberated by Islam!
[00:50:01.154 --> 00:50:03.855]  I mean, they still have a lot of child kidnapping and a lot of sex slaves, but
[00:50:05.213 --> 00:50:08.234]  You know, they kind of stop at 12-year-olds.
[00:50:08.234 --> 00:50:12.275]  And so, maybe we're being liberated by Islam, actually.
[00:50:12.275 --> 00:50:16.656]  Because the left is even worse than radical Islam, and I'll just go ahead and say it.
[00:50:16.656 --> 00:50:18.836]  And I've kind of been having this epiphany.
[00:50:18.836 --> 00:50:21.057]  Because the Christians won't say a damn thing in the UK.
[00:50:21.057 --> 00:50:27.958]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:30.519]  The next thing I'm going to get to is so big.
[00:50:32.486 --> 00:50:37.889]  That I really don't want to just put it out there and not give it the attention it deserves, but I'm going to do it.
[00:50:37.889 --> 00:50:41.530]  Because my brain thinks a little bit different than a lot of people's.
[00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:52.776]  And I always kind of have a memory, and I think about how it connects to things, and how it ties into other events that have unfolded.
[00:50:52.776 --> 00:50:58.339]  And so, yeah, everybody's really excited right now that AOC, the meth mouth,
[00:50:59.485 --> 00:51:02.929]  The creature from the methamphetamine lagoon.
[00:51:02.929 --> 00:51:06.632]  Everyone is just so excited that she, she didn't steal a million.
[00:51:06.632 --> 00:51:08.354]  She didn't steal two million.
[00:51:08.354 --> 00:51:16.482]  I went in this morning when I saw it into the SEC records and the Federal Election Commission records.
[00:51:16.482 --> 00:51:18.124]  And that's why she ended up running.
[00:51:18.124 --> 00:51:20.587]  She was a front person for Soros money.
[00:51:21.687 --> 00:51:23.168]  And it didn't just get 18 million.
[00:51:23.168 --> 00:51:24.189]  We found other PACs.
[00:51:24.189 --> 00:51:26.491]  You'll hear about those in the next few days.
[00:51:26.491 --> 00:51:30.274]  Of course her and her business manager pocketed millions.
[00:51:30.274 --> 00:51:33.116]  Totally illegal!
[00:51:33.116 --> 00:51:35.217]  But when you're a Democrat, you're allowed to do it.
[00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:38.820]  So the rest of the story here in just a moment.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:49.929]  That said, we have some big specials that are going to be ending this week that are some of the biggest specials we've ever had.
[00:51:51.639 --> 00:51:57.373]  And are products that, if you're a man particularly, you're insane if you're not taking.
[00:51:58.627 --> 00:52:12.950]  I set out with top developers, this product's been out about two years, took about a year to get it done, and I said, I see all these testosterone boosters and all these other libido boosters, and I know that the industry marks things up seven times on average.
[00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:18.051]  I just want to mark it up 150% and I want to take most of the money and put it into the product.
[00:52:18.051 --> 00:52:20.332]  Instead of having $2 a product, I wanted to have $10, $15 a product in it.
[00:52:21.952 --> 00:52:23.893]  And companies go, no one's ever done that.
[00:52:23.893 --> 00:52:25.054]  No one does that.
[00:52:25.054 --> 00:52:28.776]  Usually the container, the bottle, is more cost than what's in it.
[00:52:28.776 --> 00:52:34.060]  And herbs and stuff that God gave us are so incredible, it still blows people away.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:41.625]  And that's where all the modern drugs and all that stuff comes from, is copying what's in plants, what's in herbs, what's in minerals, what's in compounds.
[00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:50.931]  So I set out, with this product, Alpha Power, to produce something that is the strongest
[00:52:52.358 --> 00:53:00.182]  Libido, stamina, energy, sports, natural healthy enhancer that you can get.
[00:53:00.182 --> 00:53:03.024]  You can pay $100 for something that isn't as good.
[00:53:03.024 --> 00:53:06.746]  And it's usually a great deal at $69.
[00:53:06.746 --> 00:53:10.408]  It's $34.95 right now.
[00:53:10.408 --> 00:53:12.029]  It's 50% off.
[00:53:12.029 --> 00:53:20.134]  And we've got a combo deal going where you can get it, the strength and recovery combo, you can get it with BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:53:20.939 --> 00:53:26.620]  And again, the average turmeric formula, which is so hard to isolate and it's so powerful, is 3 to 5%.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.501]  They know you're getting a result with that.
[00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:31.262]  I said, is it safe to give them the strongest available?
[00:53:31.262 --> 00:53:33.102]  And they said, well, no one's done it.
[00:53:33.102 --> 00:53:35.623]  Maybe other top brands are 80%.
[00:53:35.623 --> 00:53:37.543]  They said, no one else does that.
[00:53:37.543 --> 00:53:39.184]  A couple of brands do 80%.
[00:53:39.184 --> 00:53:40.984]  They said, our chemists can give you 95%.
[00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:43.765]  This is tested curcuminoid.
[00:53:45.316 --> 00:53:47.818]  And I said, I want 95% curcuminoid.
[00:53:47.818 --> 00:53:56.926]  So our turmeric is fresh and organic and there's an extraction patented process we gotta pay a lot of money for where it's 95% curcuminoid.
[00:53:56.926 --> 00:53:59.428]  If you don't know what that means, it's insane.
[00:53:59.428 --> 00:54:04.313]  I personally, if I take a leave, I get incredible heartburn and I feel horrible.
[00:54:04.313 --> 00:54:05.914]  Advil works really great for me.
[00:54:05.914 --> 00:54:08.837]  It's a great product.
[00:54:08.837 --> 00:54:10.058]  And I'm not comparing it to a drug.
[00:54:10.058 --> 00:54:12.140]  I'm just telling you personally, I don't take that now.
[00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:19.235]  I take a couple of bodies when I sprain an ankle or something happens, and it's way better for me personally.
[00:54:19.235 --> 00:54:23.538]  Just experience it for yourself what Mother Nature gave us.
[00:54:23.538 --> 00:54:24.159]  Curcuminoid.
[00:54:24.159 --> 00:54:29.242]  Everybody knows it is curry, but the chemical in curry is curcuminoid.
[00:54:29.242 --> 00:54:31.784]  Everybody knows how good it is.
[00:54:31.784 --> 00:54:35.987]  A little sprinkle of curry on that Indian food or that Chinese food, it's like, mmm, so good.
[00:54:35.987 --> 00:54:37.088]  You like hot food?
[00:54:37.088 --> 00:54:41.711]  This is concentrated hundreds and hundreds of times what you're gonna get in that meal.
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.241]  It isn't just curry.
[00:54:45.241 --> 00:54:47.822]  It's concentrated curry.
[00:54:47.822 --> 00:55:00.048]  The actual essence organically transferred and the great, you know, Indian analyst, the great Indian apothecaries will tell you that turmeric's the top thing.
[00:55:00.048 --> 00:55:08.552]  You take it with the different compounds we've got in the pill that are natural as well, they accelerate it and they get it into your body, into your cells.
[00:55:08.552 --> 00:55:09.273]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:55:10.563 --> 00:55:25.672]  So the InfoWars Life Strength and Recovery Combo is 50% off Alpha Power and Bodies right now and you fund the InfoWars a total and complete gigantic insane fire breathing win win win win win up one side and down the other.
[00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:29.973]  Take advantage of it today.
[00:55:29.973 --> 00:55:31.454]  X2 will be back in about a week.
[00:55:31.454 --> 00:55:32.234]  It's produced.
[00:55:32.234 --> 00:55:33.655]  We got them to do a better deal.
[00:55:33.655 --> 00:55:36.216]  The Deep Earth Crystal Iodine that was so popular, I thought it was gone.
[00:55:36.216 --> 00:55:37.717]  It's been sold out in three or four months.
[00:55:37.717 --> 00:55:38.958]  It's back.
[00:55:38.958 --> 00:55:40.659]  You can pre-order it at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:55:40.659 --> 00:55:43.780]  Look at those 6,000 plus reviews.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.321]  4.9, 98% review.
[00:55:45.321 --> 00:55:47.322]  The original, exact same.
[00:55:47.322 --> 00:55:48.643]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:55:48.643 --> 00:55:50.204]  We got the deal.
[00:55:50.204 --> 00:55:54.126]  I played guts ball, art of the deal, and we got it for you.
[00:55:54.126 --> 00:55:54.947]  And that's why it's
[00:55:57.141 --> 00:56:00.082]  37% off, pre-ordered, out of the gates, and a discount.
[00:56:00.082 --> 00:56:01.644]  Passing those discounts on to you.
[00:56:01.644 --> 00:56:05.066]  Now, let me stop right there.
[00:56:05.066 --> 00:56:13.711]  I did not get to the AOC thing, and I did not spend time on all the other big stories that I've got here.
[00:56:13.711 --> 00:56:15.753]  I did not do that.
[00:56:15.753 --> 00:56:20.656]  And I've got Faith Goldie popping in, and I've got Paul Watson in the studio, but let me tell you something.
[00:56:20.656 --> 00:56:23.298]  I'm not a vindictive person, and
[00:56:25.054 --> 00:56:33.861]  I don't even like going to the zoo because you see those poor caged tigers and things that should be running around in the jungle.
[00:56:33.861 --> 00:56:39.585]  And I don't wish harm on her, but she wishes harm on us and she's trying to take over our lives and trying to run things.
[00:56:39.585 --> 00:56:54.177]  But Dinesh D'Souza, who's a friend of mine and who is one of the top documentary filmmakers in history, got some of his friends to give twenty-something thousand dollars to his college best friend who was running for Senate against Hillary Clinton a decade ago.
[00:56:55.638 --> 00:57:02.163]  And then once he got a divorce, the liberals got his bank records, and they found out that he didn't know it was illegal.
[00:57:02.163 --> 00:57:09.788]  He could have just set up a PAC and done it, but he got them to get $23,000, I've got the articles here, to the Senate candidate.
[00:57:09.788 --> 00:57:12.550]  Now, Hillary's gotten billions at her illegal foundation.
[00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:14.712]  She didn't get in trouble.
[00:57:14.712 --> 00:57:22.298]  And now AOC raised $18 million at one PAC that she never identified as hers and kept millions.
[00:57:22.298 --> 00:57:24.479]  And now she's in a lot of trouble.
[00:57:24.479 --> 00:57:25.360]  So I'm going to say this right now.
[00:57:26.801 --> 00:57:28.743]  AOC needs to be under the prison.
[00:57:28.743 --> 00:57:30.044]  But they're going to try to spin this.
[00:57:30.044 --> 00:57:35.209]  But if we get the story out accurately, we could send AOC to prison.
[00:57:35.209 --> 00:57:38.873]  And by the way, the planets have aligned here.
[00:57:38.873 --> 00:57:40.674]  The planets have aligned.
[00:57:40.674 --> 00:57:43.517]  The Democrats want to flush this turd.
[00:57:43.517 --> 00:57:44.918]  And I want to help them.
[00:57:44.918 --> 00:57:45.379]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:49.341 --> 00:57:52.602]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:55.604]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[00:57:55.604 --> 00:58:02.487]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[00:58:02.487 --> 00:58:03.627]  X2 is back.
[00:58:03.627 --> 00:58:04.407]  We got it.
[00:58:04.407 --> 00:58:06.088]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[00:58:06.088 --> 00:58:07.689]  We rushed it into production.
[00:58:07.689 --> 00:58:08.449]  It's been bottled.
[00:58:08.449 --> 00:58:10.150]  The labels are being put on today.
[00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:15.752]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the plant in the Rockies.
[00:58:15.752 --> 00:58:17.553]  And it's going to be shipped out to you.
[00:58:17.553 --> 00:58:19.034]  Be sure and sign up for auto-ship.
[00:58:19.034 --> 00:58:20.874]  An additional 10% off.
[00:58:20.874 --> 00:58:25.496]  The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[00:58:25.496 --> 00:58:27.397]  Research the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:58:27.397 --> 00:58:29.178]  Find out why it's so important.
[00:58:29.178 --> 00:58:30.999]  Find out what the globalists don't want you to have.
[00:58:31.699 --> 00:58:38.342]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[00:58:38.342 --> 00:58:38.522]  It's you!
[00:58:59.363 --> 00:59:01.865]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[00:59:01.865 --> 00:59:03.246]  You are the info war.
[00:59:03.246 --> 00:59:06.108]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[00:59:20.519 --> 00:59:31.902]  That everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[00:59:31.902 --> 00:59:39.884]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[00:59:39.884 --> 00:59:46.926]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for a free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:59:46.926 --> 00:59:49.667]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[00:59:53.317 --> 00:59:55.958]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:27.245 --> 01:00:30.652]  Well, I'm upper, upper class high society.
[01:00:33.434 --> 01:00:36.195]  All right, let's get serious here.
[01:00:36.195 --> 01:00:39.196]  Faith Goldie is going to be on the show.
[01:00:39.196 --> 01:00:41.637]  And by the way, I didn't do producing today.
[01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:48.579]  She did a bunch of big interviews with people at CPAC that were Republicans censoring other people.
[01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:49.479]  And she confronted them.
[01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.420]  So that's the whole point of the interview.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.721]  And I just didn't get here for a production meeting this morning.
[01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:57.262]  So we'll have to move Faith to tomorrow if we don't have that.
[01:00:57.262 --> 01:00:58.602]  It was the same story yesterday.
[01:00:58.602 --> 01:01:01.043]  And I just I do my producing now live on air.
[01:01:02.543 --> 01:01:03.304]  Oh, we have the videos.
[01:01:03.304 --> 01:01:05.145]  Okay, and I'm going to print out all those things.
[01:01:05.145 --> 01:01:06.526]  And I'm not bitching at the crew.
[01:01:06.526 --> 01:01:08.788]  This is totally transparent television.
[01:01:08.788 --> 01:01:14.312]  You wonder why you tune to CNN and it's the same report and the same talking points every show for like a week straight.
[01:01:14.312 --> 01:01:22.459]  It's because corporate guys write up the agreement, they check with other corporations, they have a consensus, and then they put it out.
[01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:25.348]  And that's what they do over and over again.
[01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:26.970]  So that's why it's so boring.
[01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:28.731]  It's why it's so stale.
[01:01:28.731 --> 01:01:30.493]  You know it's not spontaneous.
[01:01:30.493 --> 01:01:32.534]  That's why I can go on Joe Rogan.
[01:01:32.534 --> 01:01:35.096]  The first time it's the biggest podcast he ever does.
[01:01:35.096 --> 01:01:37.578]  The second time it's the biggest podcast he ever does.
[01:01:37.578 --> 01:01:39.080]  Breaking that previous record.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:44.124]  Because people are hungry for reality.
[01:01:44.124 --> 01:01:45.545]  Even if some of it is a train wreck.
[01:01:46.584 --> 01:01:50.246]  Joe's the biggest podcaster in the world, and I'm number one every time I go on.
[01:01:50.246 --> 01:01:51.446]  Why?
[01:01:51.446 --> 01:01:55.608]  Because the people are hungry.
[01:01:55.608 --> 01:02:05.672]  Because the people don't want to be spoon-fed garbage over and over and over and over again.
[01:02:05.672 --> 01:02:07.133]  They're sick of it.
[01:02:07.133 --> 01:02:09.354]  They're tired of it.
[01:02:09.354 --> 01:02:11.255]  So I'll say it again.
[01:02:11.255 --> 01:02:13.616]  Faith Goldie coming on hangs in the balance.
[01:02:14.707 --> 01:02:15.147]  All right.
[01:02:36.184 --> 01:02:39.929]  I've got like seven or eight stacks of prepared research I did.
[01:02:39.929 --> 01:02:43.012]  I mean, I did an hour of research on that stack.
[01:02:43.012 --> 01:02:44.895]  I did 30 minutes of research on that stack.
[01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:48.439]  I did probably 45 minutes of research on that stack.
[01:02:48.439 --> 01:02:52.284]  I did hours of research on this stack previously and then currently.
[01:02:52.284 --> 01:02:53.905]  And I did a bunch of research on this stack.
[01:02:54.918 --> 01:02:57.680]  And so I'm here, and I'm not complaining.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.782]  I'm just telling you that that's why I don't talk in the hallways.
[01:03:00.782 --> 01:03:07.726]  It's why I don't like these little dances and little social network things and little things that everybody does.
[01:03:07.726 --> 01:03:09.227]  Yeah, it's too late for Adrenochrome.
[01:03:09.227 --> 01:03:10.727]  Too late for Adrenochrome.
[01:03:10.727 --> 01:03:11.888]  It's three and a half minutes.
[01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:14.690]  It's three minutes, 22 seconds long.
[01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:18.812]  But I like Adrenochrome because it's something people said didn't exist and wasn't happening.
[01:03:18.812 --> 01:03:20.833]  So we're going to start the next segment.
[01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:21.474]  We're going to come in.
[01:03:23.558 --> 01:03:30.202]  We're going to come in with the Anvil of Krom, which is putting the computer backwards.
[01:03:30.202 --> 01:03:30.862]  I love it.
[01:03:30.862 --> 01:03:32.223]  Krom of Anvil.
[01:03:32.223 --> 01:03:35.025]  Those cute little mistakes you end up worshipping.
[01:03:35.025 --> 01:03:44.290]  We'll play Krom of Anvil when we come in, then we'll play Adrena-Krom, and then we'll have Faith Golding on, and then we'll have Paul Watson in studio with us, and it's going to be fabulous.
[01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:52.475]  And then, will that bug-eyed demon witch, Alexandria Cortez, AOC,
[01:03:54.059 --> 01:04:04.307]  Will she be allowed to steal millions directly like Nancy Pelosi's done and like Maxine Waters has done because they're protected?
[01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:13.114]  Will she be allowed to do all that when other people have been sent to jail for one one hundredth of what she's done?
[01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:14.656]  We're going to name names.
[01:04:14.656 --> 01:04:17.878]  Will she get away with that?
[01:04:17.878 --> 01:04:18.859]  And I'm predicting she won't.
[01:04:22.216 --> 01:04:33.226]  Because she's threatening the Democratic Party to go after all their bluebloods, and she's so unpopular, and she's killing them, she's about to get indicted!
[01:04:33.226 --> 01:04:39.172]  Within a few months, AOC, you heard it here first, will be indicted.
[01:04:39.172 --> 01:04:45.078]  And her political career is already paying char on at the River Styx, the coins.
[01:04:46.696 --> 01:04:47.937]  It's just sad to see her go.
[01:04:47.937 --> 01:04:50.218]  You know, Hillary was planning to run.
[01:04:50.218 --> 01:04:51.379]  She finally said she's not.
[01:04:51.379 --> 01:04:52.459]  I believe her.
[01:04:52.459 --> 01:04:55.701]  But it's sad to see them go because they're so damaging to their criminal cause.
[01:04:58.447 --> 01:04:58.948]  It's simple.
[01:04:58.948 --> 01:05:05.074]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:05:05.074 --> 01:05:07.557]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:05:07.557 --> 01:05:11.201]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all the great it is.
[01:05:11.201 --> 01:05:13.943]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.045]  What is the top tumor?
[01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:17.187]  It's the bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:05:17.187 --> 01:05:19.109]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:05:19.209 --> 01:05:20.249]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:05:20.249 --> 01:05:22.210]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:25.811]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:28.972]  And I'm like, uh, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[01:05:28.972 --> 01:05:29.232]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[01:05:29.232 --> 01:05:30.672]  No one's ever done it.
[01:05:30.672 --> 01:05:32.593]  I said, how much does that cost per bottle?
[01:05:32.593 --> 01:05:33.533]  It costs $10.
[01:05:33.533 --> 01:05:35.033]  No one's ever done that.
[01:05:35.033 --> 01:05:37.734]  Sir, the average competitor is 3 to 5%.
[01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:38.534]  The top brand's 50%.
[01:05:38.534 --> 01:05:40.435]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:05:41.715 --> 01:05:44.639]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive?
[01:05:44.639 --> 01:05:45.240]  Our fish oil.
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.784]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:05:47.784 --> 01:05:48.866]  My children take it.
[01:05:48.866 --> 01:05:53.192]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:05:53.192 --> 01:05:56.217]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:05:56.217 --> 01:05:56.537]  Never!
[01:06:06.221 --> 01:06:09.642]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:06:09.642 --> 01:06:15.504]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.325]  Adrenochrome.
[01:06:34.270 --> 01:06:35.290]  Adrenochrome?
[01:06:35.290 --> 01:06:37.751]  Hmm.
[01:06:37.751 --> 01:06:49.653]  Adrenochrome first hit pop culture in 1971, when gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson wrote about it in his book, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
[01:06:49.653 --> 01:06:58.355]  He wrote that his lawyer, Oscar Acosta, was defending a Satanist who was charged with molesting a child.
[01:06:58.355 --> 01:07:01.636]  The Satanist client paid his lawyer with Adrenochrome,
[01:07:03.698 --> 01:07:10.823]  And claim the only source was the adrenaline glands from a living human body.
[01:07:10.823 --> 01:07:22.590]  If you search Google for adrenochrome, the Google-supported result is from the conspiracy wiki, which suggests that it is all merely fantasy.
[01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:26.413]  But just to the right, you will find that adrenochrome is real.
[01:07:27.719 --> 01:07:36.707]  According to scientific research, adrenochrome is formed by the oxidation of its precursor, adrenaline.
[01:07:36.707 --> 01:07:42.672]  Adrenaline is the active hormone from the adrenal medulla, otherwise known as epinephrine.
[01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:50.876]  EpiPens are auto-injectors that contain synthetic adrenaline.
[01:07:50.876 --> 01:07:52.197]  Developed by the U.S.
[01:07:52.197 --> 01:07:59.965]  military to protect soldiers in the event of chemical warfare, EpiPens are used to treat extreme allergic reactions.
[01:08:01.952 --> 01:08:06.516]  EpiPens only have a shelf life of about 18 months.
[01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:19.266]  According to the manufacturer, after 18 months, the oxidation process begins and the EpiPens are turned into adrenochrome.
[01:08:19.266 --> 01:08:28.033]  Interestingly, both companies that manufacture the EpiPen, Mylon and Kaleo, are connected to the Clinton Foundation.
[01:08:32.171 --> 01:08:43.257]  Ambrosia, a controversial new startup company, was recently charging $8,000 to fill your veins with the blood of young people.
[01:08:43.257 --> 01:08:49.281]  Founder and CEO, Dr. Jesse Karmazin, who claims it will give you superhuman powers,
[01:08:50.161 --> 01:08:56.627]  ...has recently ceased patient treatments due to a recent FDA warning.
[01:08:56.627 --> 01:09:08.337]  In Greek mythology, ambrosia means immortality and was the food of the gods that gave longevity or immortality to whoever consumed it.
[01:09:08.337 --> 01:09:12.461]  It is believed by many researchers to represent the blood of the young.
[01:09:14.747 --> 01:09:23.699]  The cosmetic industry has been using aborted fetal tissues in various anti-aging skincare products.
[01:09:23.699 --> 01:09:30.708]  The taboo culture of consuming the young seems to go back through all of human history.
[01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:33.932]  But now, it seems to be coming out into the open.
[01:09:35.979 --> 01:09:39.322]  Democrats are pushing for full-term abortions.
[01:09:39.322 --> 01:09:41.383]  The infant would be delivered.
[01:09:41.383 --> 01:09:43.825]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[01:09:43.825 --> 01:09:48.929]  The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[01:09:48.929 --> 01:09:53.212]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mothers.
[01:09:53.212 --> 01:09:57.135]  And telling us that the future is too grim for us to think about raising a family.
[01:09:57.375 --> 01:10:02.437]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[01:10:02.437 --> 01:10:05.058]  Is it okay to still have children?
[01:10:05.058 --> 01:10:14.562]  How far is this going to go before humanity has enough?
[01:10:14.562 --> 01:10:17.083]  For NewsWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:10:41.564 --> 01:10:45.666]  Well, here we are, March 5th, 2019, toe-to-toe with the globalists.
[01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:48.346]  Nationalism sweeping the planet.
[01:10:48.346 --> 01:10:48.827]  It's coming out.
[01:10:48.827 --> 01:10:51.808]  They're keeping babies alive, selling their organs.
[01:10:51.808 --> 01:10:53.969]  Radical Islam is being exposed.
[01:10:53.969 --> 01:10:56.369]  So much insane stuff is unfolding.
[01:10:56.369 --> 01:11:03.812]  AOC's been caught in major campaign fraud that would have sent Dinesh D'Souza to prison for a thousand years.
[01:11:03.812 --> 01:11:06.773]  He gave twenty-something thousand dollars that wasn't filed right.
[01:11:06.773 --> 01:11:08.614]  He was sent to jail for nine months.
[01:11:09.693 --> 01:11:14.855]  Another couple years of probation for the crowd of being a popular documentary filmmaker.
[01:11:14.855 --> 01:11:27.000]  And now AOC and her chief of staff could be facing jail time if their control over the PAC was intentionally hidden, former FEC Commissioner says.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.220]  How about you kept over a million dollars of it?
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:30.481]  How about you didn't disclose it?
[01:11:30.481 --> 01:11:32.942]  You go to prison.
[01:11:32.942 --> 01:11:35.023]  But Democrats are allowed to commit crimes.
[01:11:35.023 --> 01:11:35.623]  Look at Hillary.
[01:11:36.789 --> 01:11:38.871]  And the billions of illegal money.
[01:11:38.871 --> 01:11:42.554]  Why are Republicans protecting the Democrats?
[01:11:42.554 --> 01:11:48.378]  Why is the Republican blue-blood establishment who tried to keep Trump out being put in power by Trump?
[01:11:48.378 --> 01:11:52.742]  That's my greatest criticism of the President, who's doing so many good things.
[01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:54.583]  So many good things.
[01:11:54.583 --> 01:11:59.447]  I was reading he's ending bulk collection data on the average citizen that violates the Fourth Amendment.
[01:11:59.447 --> 01:12:04.351]  Trump's announced that he's not going to let the NSA illegally spy on everybody.
[01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:04.872]  Incredible!
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:09.963]  And trying to get us out of these wars and trying to cut taxes on poor people.
[01:12:09.963 --> 01:12:11.003]  Look, I'm upper middle class.
[01:12:11.003 --> 01:12:13.745]  I'm not some super rich guy that people think what the media says.
[01:12:13.745 --> 01:12:15.326]  We bring a lot of money, but we spend it.
[01:12:15.326 --> 01:12:18.128]  The company has a lot of money, but then it's spent.
[01:12:18.128 --> 01:12:22.170]  The Alex Jones person, you know, wants to get more money to spend more money.
[01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:27.874]  I'm not against having money or having a nice car or swimming pool for your kids to be in or good health care, but I don't worship money.
[01:12:27.874 --> 01:12:30.335]  It's not my goal to get more, more, more, more, more.
[01:12:30.335 --> 01:12:30.996]  It's not my God.
[01:12:31.994 --> 01:12:35.175]  But they always try to pose like, I've got all this incredible money.
[01:12:35.175 --> 01:12:36.535]  And it just goes from there.
[01:12:36.535 --> 01:12:50.438]  But quite frankly, one Democrat attack on Trump is that a lot of middle class and upper middle class and the nouveau riche, people making a million bucks a year or whatever, their taxes went up.
[01:12:50.438 --> 01:12:52.978]  And that's because that's where most of the money's at.
[01:12:52.978 --> 01:12:54.699]  And the billionaires, they're all exempt, basically.
[01:12:54.699 --> 01:12:59.940]  But Trump passed laws to get rid of property tax exemption in blue states.
[01:13:00.742 --> 01:13:01.983]  Because that's where they have it.
[01:13:01.983 --> 01:13:04.866]  It's in all the states, but you know, federal tax exemption.
[01:13:04.866 --> 01:13:07.648]  He got rid of one of his biggest write-offs.
[01:13:07.648 --> 01:13:09.530]  That's cost him billions.
[01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:11.752]  Because we need funding.
[01:13:11.752 --> 01:13:14.314]  And you shouldn't have all these write-offs by ultra-rich.
[01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:17.997]  So you know, Warren Buffett's always, the rich don't pay taxes, I want to pay more taxes.
[01:13:17.997 --> 01:13:20.119]  But he writes the laws to not pay the taxes.
[01:13:20.119 --> 01:13:20.880]  He thinks you're an idiot.
[01:13:22.054 --> 01:13:27.255]  Joining us, riding shotgun for the next few segments, and Paul Joseph Watson comes in, is Faith Goldie.
[01:13:27.255 --> 01:13:31.376]  She ran for mayor, and was, out of 30 plus candidates, was number three.
[01:13:31.376 --> 01:13:35.277]  They banned her on internet, TV, radio, she couldn't advertise, banned her from debates.
[01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:40.538]  But of course, she's still fighting on, at Faith Goldie on Twitter, faithfortoronto.ca.
[01:13:40.538 --> 01:13:48.220]  And Paul Watson's coming in a little bit later, but I wanted to get you on, because you're doing what's really, really important, Faith.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:14:02.246]  You are going after the sick, and we've got a video we'll play in the next segment, the sickening Republican establishment, or really just Democrats, and the type of sabotage they're involved in and why this is happening.
[01:14:02.246 --> 01:14:07.068]  You've got so many big interviews on your Twitter right now and Michelle Malkin and you, but you don't clash.
[01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:08.649]  Two beautiful women together, two smart women.
[01:14:08.649 --> 01:14:10.210]  In fact, just get that off screen.
[01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:10.750]  I'm married.
[01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:11.190]  I'm married.
[01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:12.391]  Please stop right now.
[01:14:12.391 --> 01:14:14.652]  But tell us what's coming up and what you saw at CPAC.
[01:14:15.475 --> 01:14:16.375]  Yeah, absolutely, Alex.
[01:14:16.375 --> 01:14:17.095]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:14:17.095 --> 01:14:22.597]  I saw a lot of the Info Wars team on the ground, including Paul Joseph Watson, and of course, the always amazing Jake Lloyd.
[01:14:22.597 --> 01:14:32.219]  It was good to be among some friendlies on the ground, because I have to say, it would seem as though the America First crowd is now totally surrounded by the enemy.
[01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:33.759]  You called them globalists.
[01:14:33.759 --> 01:14:36.780]  There are a million different names for this multi-pronged
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:37.601]  I think?
[01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:59.065]  His 2016 message, which was America first, America first.
[01:14:59.065 --> 01:15:04.128]  And we saw that in even the president's remarks on the ground at CPAC.
[01:15:04.128 --> 01:15:07.029]  Look, Alex, I love Donald Trump.
[01:15:07.029 --> 01:15:13.192]  I want him to be reelected, but not just because I love his personality, but because I love his instincts.
[01:15:13.192 --> 01:15:14.593]  I love what he stands for.
[01:15:14.973 --> 01:15:28.418]  But we saw on the floor and seat back even a little bit at the last State of the Union was a clear pivot in what Donald Trump 2020 might look like in comparison to the Donald Trump that we all came to know and love during 2016.
[01:15:28.418 --> 01:15:36.541]  We saw the commander-in-chief say that he wants more immigration for America.
[01:15:36.881 --> 01:15:43.164]  We're seeing a slide of Trump towards the establishment and why is that happening with Faith Goldie straight ahead.
[01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:46.125]  Then Paul Joseph Watson's right there in that room.
[01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:50.247]  He's coming out of the gates in a few segments, but we've got the Michelle Malkin interview here too.
[01:15:50.247 --> 01:15:53.509]  We're going to air exclusively on air straight ahead with Faith Goldie.

[01:15:57.538 --> 01:15:58.798]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.798 --> 01:16:00.079]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.079 --> 01:16:03.819]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.819 --> 01:16:04.900]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.740]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:08.440]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:38.581 --> 01:16:40.883]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[01:16:40.883 --> 01:16:43.686]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.

[01:16:57.358 --> 01:16:58.598]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:16:58.598 --> 01:17:02.500]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.040]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.001]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:12.203]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:12.563 --> 01:17:13.764]  I can help you too.

[01:17:58.203 --> 01:18:00.705]  I've got some really good news, though.
[01:18:00.705 --> 01:18:02.067]  X2's back.
[01:18:02.067 --> 01:18:03.828]  The original X2.
[01:18:03.828 --> 01:18:06.731]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[01:18:06.731 --> 01:18:07.832]  What you want.

[01:18:08.953 --> 01:18:10.374]  It'll be here in a week.

[01:18:11.935 --> 01:18:12.916]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:12.916 --> 01:18:14.718]  With the best iodine in the world.
[01:18:14.718 --> 01:18:15.859]  X2, it's available.
[01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:16.840]  I thought X3's great.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:19.042]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[01:18:19.042 --> 01:18:20.863]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:22.205]  The scientists that do that.
[01:18:22.205 --> 01:18:24.026]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[01:18:24.847 --> 01:18:29.208]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:33.310]  We now have X2 again, and in fullwarestore.com, so hallelujah!
[01:18:33.310 --> 01:18:35.391]  It's been sold out for about almost three months.
[01:18:35.391 --> 01:18:45.014]  But we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[01:18:45.014 --> 01:18:53.597]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[01:20:21.098 --> 01:20:25.957]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:20:32.682 --> 01:20:41.346]  Infowars.com reporter Millie Weaver ran into Brian Skelter in the vent he was having and said, why did you block Mark Dice on your Twitter?
[01:20:41.346 --> 01:20:44.527]  And he said, well, I can't let him have my fame.
[01:20:44.527 --> 01:20:55.572]  Well, Mark Dice, self-made, is way bigger and is a patriot than somebody like Brian Skelter, who is a walking, talking joke and has about 100,000 viewers on his weekend show.
[01:20:55.572 --> 01:20:58.493]  I mean, this guy is literally a joke.
[01:20:58.493 --> 01:20:59.493]  But that's their idea.
[01:20:59.493 --> 01:21:00.374]  So Faith Golding
[01:21:01.713 --> 01:21:06.496]  And some of our reporters as well, Jake Lloyd, others, they go to CPAC.
[01:21:06.496 --> 01:21:10.279]  So we're not here like, oh, we want to be at CPAC or, oh, we want to be you.
[01:21:10.279 --> 01:21:12.020]  It's this once-a-year event.
[01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:14.962]  All these candy-ass Republicans are really Democrats.
[01:21:14.962 --> 01:21:19.465]  Most of these guys, not against gay guys, but they're dating Democrat men.
[01:21:20.285 --> 01:21:24.808]  And so they're all like, well, I'll tell how you bite your pillow, you know, if you don't help us do this.
[01:21:24.808 --> 01:21:30.192]  So there's a huge homosexuality issue in the Republican Party.
[01:21:30.192 --> 01:21:31.392]  And again, I'm a libertarian.
[01:21:31.392 --> 01:21:34.054]  I'm not judging people, but that's what this all is.
[01:21:34.054 --> 01:21:35.695]  So it's their event, their thing.
[01:21:35.695 --> 01:21:37.176]  They're all never Trumpers.
[01:21:37.176 --> 01:21:38.697]  They were anti-Trump.
[01:21:38.697 --> 01:21:40.218]  Now Trump is in.
[01:21:40.218 --> 01:21:46.082]  Now all they can do is try to block conservatives, nationalists, the people that brought Trump to where he is.
[01:21:46.082 --> 01:21:49.885]  So Faith Goldie earlier was breaking down the fact that Trump is surrounded
[01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:57.387]  And they've got the Democrat fact-checkers in the Southern Property Law Center and right-wing watch, you know, run by the Southern Property Law Center.
[01:21:57.387 --> 01:22:06.110]  They're running the show, having Laura Loomer thrown out, everything, and it's just this giant exercise in evil as the swamp closes in on President Trump.
[01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:08.591]  So lay out what you saw and what you witnessed, Faith.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:24.930]  Well, I'll say out of the gates that it's not just, you know, the homoheretic, so to speak, within the conservative movements, but we actually have a very apparent to the naked eye trans lobby now, full of transvestites, transgenders, call them what you want, that were on the ground at CPAC.
[01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:29.013]  We're talking about discernible men dressed in things like ostentatious ball gowns, etc.
[01:22:29.853 --> 01:22:46.105]  So, you know, the conservative, the so-called conservative, read neoconservative movement that is just grasping at the heels of Donald Trump are okay with everyone, no matter where they come from, no matter what they think or how they live their life.
[01:22:46.105 --> 01:22:56.392]  They pass no judgment unless you believe in America first, unless you believe in nationalism, unless you believe that both illegal and legal immigration, something needs to be done about the current state of policies right now.
[01:22:56.392 --> 01:22:56.973]  So what we saw
[01:22:57.333 --> 01:22:57.473]  We're
[01:23:15.410 --> 01:23:16.972]  And that's because you have power.
[01:23:16.972 --> 01:23:19.375]  You represent the people that got Trump in office.
[01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:22.558]  So he's a good guy, but here are the criminals that already ran the system.
[01:23:22.558 --> 01:23:27.244]  They're trying to keep you out because they're already so threatened by you, which is so short-sighted.
[01:23:27.244 --> 01:23:31.649]  You help get them into power, and then they hate who helped punch a hole in the wall.
[01:23:32.645 --> 01:23:34.726]  Right, and it's not us, Alex, who have power.
[01:23:34.726 --> 01:23:36.667]  It's the truth of our message that has power.
[01:23:36.667 --> 01:23:39.789]  No, I totally agree, but you understand, for these sycophants... Absolutely.
[01:23:39.789 --> 01:23:41.230]  It's what we represent.
[01:23:41.230 --> 01:23:45.092]  We represent the hunger and thirst for truth and righteousness and what's best for America.
[01:23:45.092 --> 01:23:51.376]  And myself, as a little Canadian, all I did was basically get on the ground, follow the power lines, follow where the money was,
[01:23:51.736 --> 01:23:54.117]  In other words, who was actually making these decisions?
[01:23:54.117 --> 01:23:59.259]  And we ended up at the chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp.
[01:23:59.259 --> 01:24:07.382]  This is a guy who put on CPAC, what's supposed to be the Conservative Political Action Conference, which had absolutely no signs of conservatism.
[01:24:07.382 --> 01:24:09.922]  I'm not sure what they were trying to conserve.
[01:24:09.922 --> 01:24:11.323]  More immigration?
[01:24:11.323 --> 01:24:14.044]  More transgenderism?
[01:24:14.044 --> 01:24:16.445]  What is America if that is what we're trying to conserve?
[01:24:17.365 --> 01:24:18.066]  I get it.
[01:24:18.066 --> 01:24:22.691]  A lot of people still reminisce about the Reagan Revolution, but that was for then.
[01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:24.853]  We are in a new era right now.
[01:24:24.853 --> 01:24:31.860]  America has new battles, new frontiers, and I'm sorry to say, but a dead president is not going to be able to solve them.
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.223]  We have to look forward, and what's forward
[01:24:34.843 --> 01:24:43.626]  For America, is Donald Trump delivering, committing to his promises of 2016, not pivoting and all of a sudden becoming the parrot?
[01:24:43.626 --> 01:24:44.806]  No, I totally agree.
[01:24:44.806 --> 01:24:49.688]  And putting in Burr, this neocon granddaddy and just all of it.
[01:24:49.688 --> 01:24:52.989]  He's put the mothership in over the Justice Department.
[01:24:52.989 --> 01:24:56.230]  And again, we still saw a lot of good stuff out of Trump, but also a lot of bad stuff.
[01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:57.810]  What was the feeling there then?
[01:24:57.810 --> 01:25:00.571]  I mean, because you're raising the alarm of what you saw at CPAC.
[01:25:01.913 --> 01:25:07.378]  It felt like, frankly, there's a total war on the America First crowd.
[01:25:07.378 --> 01:25:08.159]  That's what it feels like.
[01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:11.001]  There is a total war on nationalists.
[01:25:11.001 --> 01:25:18.007]  And regrettably, Donald Trump, he's got good instincts, but I can't imagine that he can't see what's going on right now.
[01:25:18.007 --> 01:25:20.349]  He, like you said, has done a lot of good things.
[01:25:20.349 --> 01:25:24.032]  And on the topic of immigration, which I'm of the opinion is the most central
[01:25:25.152 --> 01:25:35.237]  He did great things, and then enter his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who seems to frankly be shilling for interests other than America's.
[01:25:35.237 --> 01:25:40.099]  He enters in this whole lobby of really strange characters.
[01:25:40.099 --> 01:25:52.445]  And so my biggest worry for the President of the United States is not the Democrats and them going ever more loony-tune and towards socialism and all this other crap, but I'm really worried about the enemies within.
[01:25:52.865 --> 01:25:58.088]  People who are interested in pleasing their donors, as opposed to the American people.
[01:25:58.088 --> 01:26:11.337]  And that putting on these sorts of conferences, or just a bunch of frankly kabuki theater, so to almost act like a pressure relief valve, release valve rather, for the movement, when not actually even really paying protection.
[01:26:11.337 --> 01:26:12.358]  No, you're right, Faith.
[01:26:12.358 --> 01:26:15.059]  You're right, Faith Goldie, international reporter out of Canada.
[01:26:15.059 --> 01:26:16.180]  It was at CPAC.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:18.322]  And if we don't hold Trump's feet to the fire,
[01:26:19.102 --> 01:26:22.045]  Because we think, oh, we'll be nice, we back him, he's under attack.
[01:26:22.045 --> 01:26:26.669]  Yeah, he's under attack by globalist media, but also within by this fifth column.
[01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:30.653]  If we don't hold his feet in the fire, Trump will become the enemy within.
[01:26:30.653 --> 01:26:34.817]  Trump will be fully captured by these people because we allowed him to be cut off.
[01:26:34.817 --> 01:26:40.582]  So how do we fight to get Trump back on the straight and narrow?
[01:26:41.405 --> 01:26:44.386]  Right, well, I think Trump's got all of the tools that he needs.
[01:26:44.386 --> 01:26:52.049]  His catchphrase, you're fired, and a recommitment to his original plan to drain the swamp.
[01:26:52.049 --> 01:26:54.190]  Trump 2016 is perfect.
[01:26:54.190 --> 01:26:56.011]  Just keep on doing that.
[01:26:56.011 --> 01:26:56.871]  Do not pivot.
[01:26:56.871 --> 01:26:57.872]  Do not shift.
[01:26:57.872 --> 01:27:01.293]  And if you got any dead weight that is trying to bring you down,
[01:27:01.613 --> 01:27:01.933]  I think?
[01:27:25.397 --> 01:27:26.739]  Inside the White House.
[01:27:26.739 --> 01:27:27.440]  Oh absolutely.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.685]  But let me bring this up and then we're going to come back with your powerful Michelle Malkin interview.
[01:27:32.668 --> 01:27:34.389]  I don't know Kushner from the man in the moon.
[01:27:34.389 --> 01:27:39.090]  I got tricked into these White House battles of who's who and you know what's going on, Faith.
[01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:43.591]  But I mean, sometimes when I hear somebody so bad from everybody, they might be good.
[01:27:43.591 --> 01:27:47.372]  They're always saying, I'm the worst guy in the world and I'm not defending Jared Kushner.
[01:27:47.372 --> 01:27:48.593]  But Trump's got a good instinct.
[01:27:48.593 --> 01:27:49.513]  He seems to like the guy.
[01:27:49.513 --> 01:27:51.373]  He seems to have gotten some peace deals done.
[01:27:51.373 --> 01:27:55.815]  But then everybody that knows on the inside says Kushner is the worst thing since gonorrhea.
[01:27:55.815 --> 01:27:59.596]  So all I'm saying is what's up with the Kushner hate for like three years?
[01:27:59.596 --> 01:28:00.096]  That's all I hear.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:01.560]  Right.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:10.584]  Well, we know that he has some interesting bed fellowships, whether they be international and whether they be within corporate life or within other political life.
[01:28:10.584 --> 01:28:12.865]  Let's just say a political office.
[01:28:12.865 --> 01:28:23.409]  The point of the matter is that we know that, you know, back to the days when Bannon was still around, there was this tete-a-tete between the Kushnerites, if you will, within the White House and the Bannonites.
[01:28:23.809 --> 01:28:27.213]  And the Bannonites were the ones who wanted to build the wall, deport them all.
[01:28:27.213 --> 01:28:28.395]  It was very, very simple.
[01:28:28.395 --> 01:28:30.457]  We're going to end dirt-right citizenship.
[01:28:30.457 --> 01:28:35.303]  We're going to care for Dreamers, but Dreamers from America, not Dreamers who illegally entered our country.
[01:28:35.303 --> 01:28:38.628]  Jared Kushner does not seem to be as keen on keeping those promises.
[01:28:40.032 --> 01:28:42.933]  I hear you, but then I learned Bannon's as bad as you can get.
[01:28:42.933 --> 01:28:44.434]  It was a total double dealer.
[01:28:44.434 --> 01:28:45.375]  Here's my deal.
[01:28:45.375 --> 01:28:47.816]  I'm just going to promote ideology and ideas.
[01:28:47.816 --> 01:28:51.457]  I don't know who's really running things up there because I don't get involved in intercourt battles.
[01:28:51.457 --> 01:28:54.859]  But let's come back with your Michelle Malkin interview with Faith Golding.
[01:28:57.116 --> 01:28:59.478]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[01:28:59.478 --> 01:29:02.360]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:07.424]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[01:29:07.424 --> 01:29:14.610]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:19.154]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:23.397]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[01:29:23.397 --> 01:29:26.519]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[01:29:26.519 --> 01:29:29.140]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:30.641]  Get sober now.
[01:29:30.641 --> 01:29:33.984]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.

[01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:21.071]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:21.071 --> 01:33:22.973]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:24.674]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:24.674 --> 01:33:26.435]  Well, so does he.

[01:33:49.696 --> 01:33:52.637]  You think it's bad for Bell Toast?
[01:33:52.637 --> 01:33:53.238]  No.
[01:33:53.238 --> 01:33:55.419]  The Bell Toast for thee.
[01:33:55.419 --> 01:33:56.699]  It's epic.
[01:33:56.699 --> 01:33:59.501]  You're getting to go to the game of it.
[01:33:59.501 --> 01:34:05.424]  Not just be an NPC, but actually effect change on a global scale for humanity.
[01:34:05.424 --> 01:34:06.565]  That's what really matters.
[01:34:10.402 --> 01:34:13.823]  I want to go back to Trace Golden and Paul Watch is coming in for the Balance of the Broadcast.
[01:34:13.823 --> 01:34:16.123]  I'll be back with him today on The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:16.123 --> 01:34:20.484]  We're going to have an Ask Me Anything for Paul and myself.
[01:34:20.484 --> 01:34:23.865]  Hell, let's throw Owen into it for the last hour and a half.
[01:34:23.865 --> 01:34:26.006]  That'll be up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:26.006 --> 01:34:28.886]  Forget my show, The Verboten Broadcast.
[01:34:28.886 --> 01:34:30.267]  And why is it verboten?
[01:34:30.267 --> 01:34:31.567]  It's a train wreck.
[01:34:31.567 --> 01:34:32.607]  I'm super obnoxious.
[01:34:32.607 --> 01:34:34.768]  I can't listen to myself most of the time, I'll be honest with you.
[01:34:35.868 --> 01:34:36.729]  We are pro-human.
[01:34:36.729 --> 01:34:37.789]  We do believe in people.
[01:34:37.789 --> 01:34:39.611]  We don't lie on purpose.
[01:34:39.611 --> 01:34:44.574]  God knows I make enough mistakes without... I couldn't imagine trying to make up lies.
[01:34:44.574 --> 01:34:50.678]  Like, the truth's so deep and so crazy and so multifaceted that I can't even imagine that.
[01:34:50.678 --> 01:34:51.058]  But let me say it.
[01:34:51.058 --> 01:34:52.419]  Let me tell you something.
[01:34:53.797 --> 01:35:01.942]  You get a real eye into the corrupt elements of the CIA and the Ford Foundation and the globalists and the ruling class in the early 1990s.
[01:35:01.942 --> 01:35:04.124]  Because they're putting the Clintons in office.
[01:35:04.124 --> 01:35:12.249]  And decades later, a few years ago, we got via lawsuits, via Judicial Watch, their internal meetings when they first get elected to the White House.
[01:35:12.249 --> 01:35:13.670]  They're not worried about the Russians.
[01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:15.151]  They're not worried about the Chinese.
[01:35:15.151 --> 01:35:16.932]  They're not worried about Mexico.
[01:35:16.932 --> 01:35:18.133]  They're not worried about India.
[01:35:18.133 --> 01:35:21.415]  They're not worried about their blood pressure reports.
[01:35:23.188 --> 01:35:32.104]  They're worried about independent media and quote, conservatives and Christians and nationalist groups and veterans groups, because veterans take action.
[01:35:32.104 --> 01:35:32.765]  Those are people that
[01:35:33.973 --> 01:35:35.194]  I'll do something.
[01:35:35.194 --> 01:35:36.194]  They've done things.
[01:35:36.194 --> 01:35:37.755]  They've been empowered.
[01:35:37.755 --> 01:35:39.115]  They've seen things.
[01:35:39.115 --> 01:35:47.298]  And they're like, how do we keep control of conservatives and Christians and veterans?
[01:35:47.298 --> 01:35:53.881]  Like, well, we have the media demonize anybody that sells a book or a video or has a website.
[01:35:53.881 --> 01:35:57.822]  See, before websites, they say, Joseph Farah runs the Western Journalism Center.
[01:35:57.822 --> 01:36:00.524]  Before World Net Daily, we want him stopped.
[01:36:01.824 --> 01:36:08.050]  And boy, they were smart, because WorldNetDaily was a key trigger organization for us and a key breakthrough.
[01:36:08.050 --> 01:36:10.312]  So they're smart.
[01:36:10.312 --> 01:36:19.761]  I was on WorldNetDaily for like three years later, but they already were like, stop, Joseph Farah.
[01:36:19.761 --> 01:36:21.563]  They said, if we allow them to have an economy,
[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:26.284]  And if we allow them to have a community, we're going to lose.
[01:36:26.284 --> 01:36:27.785]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:36:27.785 --> 01:36:32.149]  They're censoring us all en masse just proving what we said, and we've already blown them wide open.
[01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:40.217]  So I don't want to say we're winning, because I don't want to put you to sleep, but we're winning.
[01:36:40.217 --> 01:36:44.441]  I mean, believe me, folks, they used to say I was this negative guy and we were behind.
[01:36:44.441 --> 01:36:45.042]  We're winning.
[01:36:46.232 --> 01:36:51.762]  And as long as I'm willing to get killed or put in prison, or you are, us leaders, that's what men do.
[01:36:51.762 --> 01:36:54.967]  I'm out there being a tough guy, I don't want that to happen.
[01:36:54.967 --> 01:36:56.289]  Fill your damn hand, let's go!
[01:36:56.289 --> 01:36:57.772]  I wish it was that easy.
[01:36:58.664 --> 01:37:00.744]  As long as we don't back down, we win.
[01:37:00.744 --> 01:37:08.986]  And that's what's so sad about Trump, is that he's done so much good, but he's surrounded by the swamp and the deception, and he is starting to sink into it.
[01:37:08.986 --> 01:37:19.068]  Even as he sinks, he's doing good things, but we see the swamp kind of, like the bubbles are coming up now, and his eyes are right up to here, and we're like, we're up to our guts just trying to get him out, you know?
[01:37:19.068 --> 01:37:27.750]  And so, Faith Golding, in closing, I want to air some of this Michelle Malkin interview and get you back on, the great work you're doing, but just other thoughts about this epic moment in history we're in right now.
[01:37:28.459 --> 01:37:29.000]  Absolutely.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.503]  Look, like I said, Alex, the truth is on our side.
[01:37:31.503 --> 01:37:33.746]  That's why they're afraid of we Christians, we patriots.
[01:37:33.746 --> 01:37:43.537]  But it doesn't matter how much they try to censor us, you specifically, because we are so right and because truth will always prevail, we will continue to rise.
[01:37:43.537 --> 01:37:48.023]  They can call us grifters, but let me tell you the difference between the true grifters within Conservative Inc.
[01:37:48.303 --> 01:37:50.445]  And we don't back down when the heat's applied.
[01:38:00.999 --> 01:38:01.980]  Oh, that's for sure.
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.643]  If anything, that heat just makes me go even faster.
[01:38:05.643 --> 01:38:07.224]  It's kinetic molecular theory.
[01:38:07.224 --> 01:38:10.087]  I just keep on moving faster every single time they turn up the heat.
[01:38:10.087 --> 01:38:11.268]  Absolutely, they don't realize it.
[01:38:11.268 --> 01:38:13.850]  But Faith, isn't that because you talk about God and it's real.
[01:38:13.850 --> 01:38:15.191]  It's not a bad heat with God.
[01:38:15.191 --> 01:38:16.012]  It's that love.
[01:38:16.012 --> 01:38:16.933]  It's so hot.
[01:38:16.933 --> 01:38:18.494]  They think they're going to intimidate me?
[01:38:18.494 --> 01:38:19.555]  I've already met God.
[01:38:19.555 --> 01:38:22.878]  I'm not even... I'm feeling guilty that I haven't been good enough.
[01:38:22.878 --> 01:38:24.579]  I mean, they think they're threats to anything.
[01:38:24.579 --> 01:38:25.280]  Are they kidding?
[01:38:26.195 --> 01:38:27.216]  No, it's a calling.
[01:38:27.216 --> 01:38:28.797]  It's like a soldier in battle.
[01:38:28.797 --> 01:38:31.699]  You're not going to just stop because some shelling has come your way.
[01:38:31.699 --> 01:38:37.083]  You're going to keep on fighting even harder because you know your brothers in arms are right here, and you all need each other in order to get through this.
[01:38:37.083 --> 01:38:39.926]  And let me tell you, Alex, I look at you as a brother in arms.
[01:38:39.926 --> 01:38:43.328]  So many other great independent media out there, and I ain't going anywhere.
[01:38:43.328 --> 01:38:46.471]  I know you're not going to go anywhere, so it doesn't matter how much they keep on trying.
[01:38:46.471 --> 01:38:50.954]  We're going to find new ways, and through the grace of God, we are going to continue to grow in numbers.
[01:38:50.954 --> 01:38:52.195]  And to you folks at home,
[01:38:52.555 --> 01:38:54.196]  No one is coming to save us.
[01:38:54.196 --> 01:38:56.137]  We all have to put in the work.
[01:38:56.137 --> 01:39:03.762]  So emerge from behind your keyboards, watch this, spread it, but then also go be active, have these conversations in real life as well.
[01:39:03.762 --> 01:39:08.124]  We all have to do our part because if they just see a couple of leaders, they try to take us out.
[01:39:08.124 --> 01:39:19.731]  But if our numbers keep on growing and we go to a grassroots, a truly grassroots revolution, which means to return to the old order, there's absolutely nothing that these demons and lizard people can do to shut us up.
[01:39:20.251 --> 01:39:28.758]  That's right, and the old order is the new order of renaissance and humanity and everything that we've seen in the human ethos in the last 2,500 years.
[01:39:28.758 --> 01:39:31.700]  Coming right out of where you're from, in the Greek Isles.
[01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.081]  Faith Goldie, we salute you.
[01:39:33.081 --> 01:39:35.703]  Everyone should follow your amazing work.
[01:39:35.703 --> 01:39:39.606]  You and the great work your husband is involved in at Twitter, Faith Goldie.
[01:39:39.606 --> 01:39:44.990]  Everybody should sign up for your email, sign up for our email in case they take you off, so we can still be in contact with each other.
[01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:46.951]  And faithfortoronto.ca.
[01:39:46.951 --> 01:39:47.592]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:39:48.578 --> 01:39:49.418]  God love you, Alex.
[01:39:49.418 --> 01:39:50.579]  Take care.
[01:39:50.579 --> 01:39:51.639]  Well, there goes Faith Golden.
[01:39:51.639 --> 01:39:52.679]  You take care, too.
[01:39:52.679 --> 01:39:59.781]  Now, let's go to this part of this report.
[01:39:59.781 --> 01:40:03.242]  It's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWorks.com with her and Michelle Malkin.
[01:40:03.242 --> 01:40:07.283]  And I've had my differences with Michelle Malkin, but Michelle Malkin, overall, is a patriot.
[01:40:07.283 --> 01:40:09.124]  And so just got in fights with her 15 years ago.
[01:40:09.124 --> 01:40:11.625]  Michelle, once you're on the show, want to bury the hatchet.
[01:40:11.625 --> 01:40:12.285]  Here's Michelle Malkin.
[01:40:13.394 --> 01:40:14.355]  Thank you so much.
[01:40:14.355 --> 01:40:14.656]  Thank you.
[01:40:14.656 --> 01:40:14.996]  See you later.
[01:40:14.996 --> 01:40:16.157]  See you later.
[01:40:16.157 --> 01:40:21.643]  Mr. Schlapp, do you have any comment as to why conservative commentators... Classic DC.
[01:40:21.643 --> 01:40:22.825]  Neocon.
[01:40:22.825 --> 01:40:25.888]  I am not a neocon.
[01:40:25.888 --> 01:40:26.288]  You're not?
[01:40:27.333 --> 01:40:28.674]  Meet Matt Schlapp.
[01:40:28.674 --> 01:40:31.195]  He's the Chairman of the ACU.
[01:40:31.195 --> 01:40:37.358]  This is his wife, Mercedes Schlapp, Director of Strategic Communications for the President of the United States.
[01:40:37.358 --> 01:40:40.079]  And Mercedes, who is incredible, sitting right here.
[01:40:40.079 --> 01:40:41.760]  Mercedes, thank you.
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:55.227]  Matt Schlapp's ACU is the host of CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual convention which this year decided to ignore immigration and ban right-wing media like Laura Loomer, VDare, Nick Fuentes, and me, Faith
[01:40:55.307 --> 01:40:59.170]  Goldie, do you think that there are enemies within, so to speak, when it comes to the White House?
[01:40:59.170 --> 01:40:59.851]  Absolutely.
[01:40:59.851 --> 01:41:06.016]  And I tried to get this message across, too, during my speech, that our enemies are not just from without.
[01:41:06.016 --> 01:41:07.537]  They are from within.
[01:41:07.537 --> 01:41:11.180]  Matt, why did you ban Nick Fuentes from this event?
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:14.183]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:41:14.183 --> 01:41:16.865]  Why did you ban Paul Triggin from this event?
[01:41:16.865 --> 01:41:21.249]  Matt, why is it that the America First crowd has been kicked out of Syntac this year?
[01:41:21.889 --> 01:41:25.671]  Matt, why is it that anybody who's pro-Wall wasn't invited to speak?
[01:41:25.671 --> 01:41:28.213]  I'm pro-Wall, I spoke.
[01:41:28.213 --> 01:41:29.673]  Why wasn't Ann Coulter invited?
[01:41:29.673 --> 01:41:31.354]  I'm unsure whether or not she was invited.
[01:41:31.354 --> 01:41:35.977]  Matt, why couldn't Faith Goldie get press credentials for this?
[01:41:35.977 --> 01:41:38.698]  Canadian journalist, she ran for mayor of Toronto.
[01:41:38.698 --> 01:41:41.000]  Trump's speech didn't sound like Trump.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.161]  And there'll be some people in the room that don't like this.
[01:41:43.661 --> 01:41:45.743]  I got all these companies moving in.
[01:41:45.743 --> 01:41:47.244]  They need workers.
[01:41:47.244 --> 01:41:52.487]  We have to bring people into our country to work at these great plants that are opening up all over the place.
[01:41:52.487 --> 01:41:54.609]  Economic driven immigrants.
[01:41:54.609 --> 01:41:56.310]  Those that want to come here to work.
[01:41:57.654 --> 01:42:02.175]  To invest in their dreams and this country to create opportunities for all of us.
[01:42:02.175 --> 01:42:04.256]  Nope, it sounded like the schlaps.
[01:42:04.256 --> 01:42:08.417]  This was not necessarily what I was saying during the campaign.
[01:42:08.417 --> 01:42:14.559]  A family that lobbies for the cap to be busted on detrimental policies like the H-2B visa.
[01:42:14.559 --> 01:42:24.042]  A family that sends away angel moms without Trump's permission on the eve of a third spending bill which lacks proper funds for Trump's wall.
[01:42:24.562 --> 01:42:27.563]  Americans didn't vote for Matt and Mercedes Schlapp.
[01:42:27.563 --> 01:42:31.184]  And they won't vote for Matt and Mercedes Schlapp in 2020.
[01:42:31.184 --> 01:42:33.665]  But they will vote for Donald Trump.
[01:42:33.665 --> 01:42:38.107]  It's time for Schlapp's donors to take a backseat and let Trump's voters take the wheel.
[01:42:53.903 --> 01:43:00.587]  Well, I've got some really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners.
[01:43:00.587 --> 01:43:03.608]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.
[01:43:03.608 --> 01:43:10.472]  It's been a year and a half fight, but we have the original producer, the original crystal source, the best atomic iodide in the world.
[01:43:10.472 --> 01:43:11.592]  X2 is back.
[01:43:11.592 --> 01:43:12.393]  We got it.
[01:43:12.393 --> 01:43:14.074]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[01:43:14.074 --> 01:43:15.675]  We rushed it into production.
[01:43:15.675 --> 01:43:16.435]  It's been bottled.
[01:43:16.435 --> 01:43:18.136]  The labels are being put on today.
[01:43:18.436 --> 01:43:23.740]  And that it's going to be on an 18-wheeler, right here to Austin, from the plant in the Rockies.
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.541]  And it's going to be shipped out to you.
[01:43:25.541 --> 01:43:27.083]  Be sure and sign up for AutoShip.
[01:43:27.083 --> 01:43:28.864]  An additional 10% off.
[01:43:28.864 --> 01:43:33.487]  The 25% off celebration of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it.
[01:43:33.487 --> 01:43:35.389]  Research the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:43:35.389 --> 01:43:36.750]  Find out why it's so important.
[01:43:37.170 --> 01:43:43.814]  Find out what the globalists don't want you to have, the good halogens, don't want you to have the bad halogens, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:43.814 --> 01:43:45.035]  That's the umbrella site.
[01:43:45.035 --> 01:43:46.275]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:43:46.275 --> 01:43:47.836]  They should write the supplements.
[01:43:47.836 --> 01:43:50.998]  And this is the King Daddy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:50.998 --> 01:43:52.919]  It is X2 Original.
[01:43:52.919 --> 01:43:55.261]  Now back at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:56.974 --> 01:44:02.738]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:44:02.738 --> 01:44:04.199]  So I need to make them strong now.
[01:44:04.199 --> 01:44:05.960]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.801]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:44:07.801 --> 01:44:09.442]  Now I can instruct them.
[01:44:09.442 --> 01:44:11.163]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[01:44:11.163 --> 01:44:12.164]  But not once I'm gone.
[01:44:12.264 --> 01:44:17.407]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:44:17.407 --> 01:44:22.991]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:44:22.991 --> 01:44:26.634]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:44:26.634 --> 01:44:31.597]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:44:31.597 --> 01:44:38.502]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it, and go through the fire for it.
[01:44:38.502 --> 01:44:42.164]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:44:42.264 --> 01:44:49.871]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:44:49.871 --> 01:44:56.478]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:44:58.473 --> 01:45:03.656]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:45:03.656 --> 01:45:12.221]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:45:12.221 --> 01:45:15.202]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:45:15.202 --> 01:45:16.963]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:45:16.963 --> 01:45:23.227]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:45:25.308 --> 01:45:30.649]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:45:30.649 --> 01:45:33.590]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:37.190]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:41.491]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:45:41.491 --> 01:45:43.332]  I've got two in my home.
[01:45:43.332 --> 01:45:49.413]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:45:49.413 --> 01:45:50.273]  Don't live
[01:45:51.093 --> 01:45:55.157]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[01:45:55.157 --> 01:45:58.760]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.842]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they canned food.
[01:46:01.842 --> 01:46:04.805]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.805 --> 01:46:07.728]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:11.771]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply.
[01:46:13.348 --> 01:46:22.472]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:22.472 --> 01:46:27.835]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:46:27.835 --> 01:46:30.116]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:46:30.116 --> 01:46:33.618]  mfulworthstore.com on mfulworthselect storable foods.
[01:46:33.618 --> 01:46:35.098]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:46:35.098 --> 01:46:39.100]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:41.301]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:46:41.301 --> 01:46:42.402]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:46:42.862 --> 01:46:44.843]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.843 --> 01:46:47.344]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:47.344 --> 01:46:52.366]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:46:52.366 --> 01:47:01.790]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods, powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:04.451]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.537 --> 01:47:17.038]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:47:17.038 --> 01:47:17.598]  to 3 p.m.
[01:47:17.598 --> 01:47:19.698]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.698 --> 01:47:25.140]  And I'm that dirty evil person they demonize all day though I'm not.
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:26.660]  Alex Jones.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.980]  Until the day I die.
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:28.400]  And then there's
[01:47:44.901 --> 01:47:46.083]  The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[01:47:46.083 --> 01:47:47.987]  We can't have Roger Stone on.
[01:47:47.987 --> 01:47:51.072]  He's totally gagged and can't even talk to me.
[01:47:51.072 --> 01:47:55.160]  He sent me a text message saying he loves me and that's basically the end of it this morning.
[01:47:55.160 --> 01:47:55.620]  Bye bye.
[01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:59.161]  into the lair of the goblins.
[01:47:59.161 --> 01:48:00.141]  He said that too.
[01:48:00.141 --> 01:48:02.742]  He said, I've now been taken over by goblins.
[01:48:02.742 --> 01:48:04.602]  What a sad end.
[01:48:04.602 --> 01:48:06.263]  Paul Watson's with us for the next hour.
[01:48:06.263 --> 01:48:10.604]  Then we'll have an hour takeover with a guest host.
[01:48:10.604 --> 01:48:16.526]  And then we're going to co-host Owen Schroer in the war room today and ask me anything.
[01:48:16.526 --> 01:48:17.967]  Ask Paul Watson anything.
[01:48:17.967 --> 01:48:22.268]  Before we set up this next big galactic hour, Paul Joseph Watson,
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:26.123]  What do you want to hit first?
[01:48:26.123 --> 01:48:29.428]  Because there's a lot of epic stuff we haven't covered yet.
[01:48:29.428 --> 01:48:33.575]  Let's start off with CPAC, Alex, because I was there briefly for about an hour.
[01:48:33.575 --> 01:48:37.060]  Basically what happened was, you know, Faith was talking about it in the previous segment.
[01:48:37.915 --> 01:48:49.466]  They banned Laura Loomer, they banned Nick Fuentes, they allowed in the very people who are working, who are abusing their platforms at CNN, BuzzFeed and these other publications to silence Conservatives.
[01:48:49.466 --> 01:48:57.254]  They let those people in, gave them platforms, they were doing media row, they were front and centre, basically gloating over what they'd done.
[01:48:57.254 --> 01:48:59.577]  I'm talking about Oliver Dorsey, I'm talking about Jared Holt.
[01:49:00.478 --> 01:49:06.667]  I was walking through, Jared Holt saw me, stopped his interview, then like immediately ran off.
[01:49:06.667 --> 01:49:09.131]  So these people are front and center, CPAC lets them in.
[01:49:09.131 --> 01:49:14.879]  And if you would have dared address the loyalty, you would have been taken down immediately.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:23.129]  The other thing is, they had stalkers, so, like, the media wouldn't try to talk to me, even though they were all taking pictures of me and Luma and whoever else.
[01:49:23.129 --> 01:49:32.781]  They would cut- sidle up next to us and listen in to our conversations, and then they would, like, follow us back to the hotel and take shots of who we're with, who we're talking to.
[01:49:33.061 --> 01:49:37.043]  Oh yeah, when I was at Trump Hotel a few months ago, Jones was seen with an attractive blonde.
[01:49:37.043 --> 01:49:38.704]  It's my wife.
[01:49:38.704 --> 01:49:42.146]  Jones was kissing a woman and grabbing her breast.
[01:49:42.146 --> 01:49:43.807]  It's in major newspapers.
[01:49:43.807 --> 01:49:44.727]  It's my wife.
[01:49:44.727 --> 01:49:47.068]  Yeah, so they were behaving like stalkers.
[01:49:47.068 --> 01:49:49.109]  They were following Farage around doing the same thing.
[01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:54.496]  They behaved like stalkers, they didn't want to actually have a conversation with us, they just wanted to eat.
[01:49:54.496 --> 01:50:06.232]  But if you attempt to talk to them, like I did Oliver Darcy last year, or like Laura Limber did, they have the right wing watch, run by the Southern Poverty Law Center, go, ugh, ex-cathedra, you are excommunicated.
[01:50:06.721 --> 01:50:10.422]  Totally, and they were like, oh, he told Laura Loomer to get Jared Holt.
[01:50:10.422 --> 01:50:12.483]  I just said, go and have a conversation with him.
[01:50:12.483 --> 01:50:20.805]  So, you know, it was interesting, but as I said, you know, there were media hit pieces about me before I went or when I was at CPAC saying, oh, you called it cucked in 2017.
[01:50:20.805 --> 01:50:22.065]  It is cucked.
[01:50:22.065 --> 01:50:23.626]  I mean, they don't even talk about immigration.
[01:50:23.626 --> 01:50:24.486]  Let's expand on that.
[01:50:24.486 --> 01:50:28.907]  It's all over the British news, and the guy that said to be the next Prime Minister says, ban you and Tommy Robinson.
[01:50:29.207 --> 01:50:29.848]  Oh, completely.
[01:50:29.848 --> 01:50:36.895]  This is Tom Watson, who's going to be the next leader of the Labour Party, potential next PM, writes a letter to Google, and he's basically on this every day.
[01:50:36.895 --> 01:50:41.760]  He says, I control the regulatory systems, and I demand they be banned immediately.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:42.961]  It's outrageous tyranny.
[01:50:42.961 --> 01:50:44.563]  Oh, but have you seen the other story today?
[01:50:44.563 --> 01:50:46.545]  He talked about social media censorship, Alex.
[01:50:47.085 --> 01:50:49.426]  Headline, Royals get tough on cyberbullying.
[01:50:49.426 --> 01:50:50.827]  AIDS 1 social media follows.
[01:50:50.827 --> 01:50:57.290]  They could be reported to police for abusing Meghan Markle, who is this big social justice warrior leader.
[01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:59.472]  Now they're having the gender-neutral baby.
[01:50:59.472 --> 01:51:01.513]  Yeah, they get to have their speech.
[01:51:02.333 --> 01:51:04.014]  And force-feed it to your kids.
[01:51:04.014 --> 01:51:05.175]  But this is where it gets weird.
[01:51:05.175 --> 01:51:07.096]  But if you criticize, you're de-platformed.
[01:51:07.096 --> 01:51:08.397]  This is where it gets weird.
[01:51:08.397 --> 01:51:15.222]  Because they're talking about the Royal Family having the power to delete comments on Twitter, to delete tweets.
[01:51:15.222 --> 01:51:18.584]  Nobody has the power to delete tweets, apart from Twitter employees.
[01:51:18.584 --> 01:51:19.164]  No, no, no, no, Paul.
[01:51:19.164 --> 01:51:20.165]  The user of the account.
[01:51:20.165 --> 01:51:23.247]  Paul, what did I tell you?
[01:51:23.247 --> 01:51:30.271]  I'm not going to get an inside baseball, but in my terrorization campaigns of people serving the system, what do you think hit the red button?
[01:51:31.934 --> 01:51:41.736]  They have given top podcasters, the top hundred I know of, on Google, on YouTube, on iTunes, curating power.
[01:51:41.736 --> 01:51:42.857]  So they've let them in.
[01:51:42.857 --> 01:51:45.337]  Remember like a year and a half ago, Project Veritas?
[01:51:45.337 --> 01:51:46.077]  That's a video?
[01:51:46.077 --> 01:51:46.637]  Yeah.
[01:51:46.637 --> 01:51:54.039]  Where they had the New York Times going, oh we stop Alex Jones, we stop veterans, we stop pro-gun-grips, anybody with American flags.
[01:51:54.039 --> 01:51:55.599]  Remember he says he's in the computer.
[01:51:55.599 --> 01:51:57.440]  Remember when CNN knew what we were doing?
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:57.620]  Yeah.
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:51:59.541]  They've given them that power.
[01:51:59.541 --> 01:52:00.901]  This is what I'm talking about in this article.
[01:52:00.901 --> 01:52:02.062]  No one knows what you're talking about.
[01:52:02.062 --> 01:52:06.164]  So it says they're going to remove obscene, offensive or threatening comments.
[01:52:06.164 --> 01:52:09.926]  And the examples they gave were people making fun of Meghan Markle, basically.
[01:52:09.926 --> 01:52:13.268]  You can't do that on Twitter unless you have insider access.
[01:52:13.268 --> 01:52:14.228]  They can flag it off.
[01:52:14.228 --> 01:52:15.929]  So think about the racketeering, Paul.
[01:52:15.929 --> 01:52:22.372]  Think about the corporate violations of federal law that they're letting private groups, corporate groups, royal families in control.
[01:52:22.372 --> 01:52:27.335]  That's the new breakaway civilization, where if you're a good globalist, you get technocracy connections.
[01:52:28.052 --> 01:52:28.512]  Completely.
[01:52:28.512 --> 01:52:32.356]  By the way, I can't give you the details, Paul, but look at me right now.
[01:52:32.356 --> 01:52:38.883]  I already knew this, so I basically bluffed people into admitting it.
[01:52:38.883 --> 01:52:41.945]  People have access to everything we do.
[01:52:41.945 --> 01:52:45.789]  Not just people that work for Google, or YouTube, or Facebook.
[01:52:45.789 --> 01:52:47.371]  It's been given.
[01:52:47.371 --> 01:52:48.151]  This is the army.
[01:52:49.127 --> 01:52:53.710]  They've given the SJWs, all of them, NSA-level connections to everything we do.
[01:52:53.710 --> 01:52:58.192]  Which is why this executive order that was mooted months ago is so important, Alex.
[01:52:58.192 --> 01:53:04.016]  You know, Trump got up and spoke about an executive order to pull federal funding from universities if they don't adhere to free speech.
[01:53:04.016 --> 01:53:06.197]  Where's the executive order on social media?
[01:53:06.197 --> 01:53:07.478]  We were promised it.
[01:53:07.478 --> 01:53:12.641]  Now, from the whispers that I heard, it's not going to be here until the 2020 campaign.
[01:53:12.641 --> 01:53:15.183]  So it's going to be a promise on the platform.
[01:53:15.811 --> 01:53:23.614]  You told me three days ago, don't say it, but I had dinner with the people, it's going to be a promise on the platform, blah blah blah, so why we should vote for this.
[01:53:23.614 --> 01:53:26.976]  And then I turn on Fox News and it's Trump's surrogate saying that.
[01:53:27.938 --> 01:53:29.799]  Show, it's not a secret.
[01:53:29.799 --> 01:53:30.940]  That makes me pissed, man.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:33.961]  You don't, like, make the First Amendment a thing on the platform.
[01:53:33.961 --> 01:53:35.582]  You defend it now.
[01:53:35.582 --> 01:53:38.883]  And I'm not on some anti-Trump rant to get Democrats to love me.
[01:53:38.883 --> 01:53:39.724]  It's not about that.
[01:53:39.724 --> 01:53:41.865]  I can't sell out, Paul.
[01:53:41.865 --> 01:53:43.506]  But this is what we need, right?
[01:53:43.506 --> 01:53:48.728]  Headline, Florida lawmaker introduces Stop Social Media Censorship Act to protect free speech online.
[01:53:48.728 --> 01:53:50.049]  This has got teeth.
[01:53:50.049 --> 01:53:55.632]  This fines social media companies with user bases over a certain amount, basically Twitter, Facebook.
[01:53:56.412 --> 01:54:01.356]  Statutory damages if they delete or censor users' religious or political speech.
[01:54:01.356 --> 01:54:09.943]  So if we get this set into motion in Florida and have mirrored bills across the country, this is going to be what Trump should have done, basically.
[01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:11.124]  This is what we need.
[01:54:11.124 --> 01:54:11.765]  No, I agree.
[01:54:11.765 --> 01:54:18.250]  So why do you think, we'll get to this next hour, Trump's doing a lot of good things, don't get me wrong, but he's doing a lot of bad stuff.
[01:54:18.250 --> 01:54:20.772]  Why does he not stand up against this core issue?
[01:54:22.092 --> 01:54:25.873]  Um, because the people who surround him are never going to get banned.
[01:54:25.873 --> 01:54:29.874]  You know, the Ben Shapiros of the world, the prominent conservatives are never going to get banned.
[01:54:29.874 --> 01:54:31.394]  So it's not on his table.
[01:54:31.394 --> 01:54:34.995]  But as you know with Trump, it's who has access to give him information.
[01:54:34.995 --> 01:54:38.676]  So if they don't think it's important, then he's not going to think it's important.
[01:54:38.676 --> 01:54:42.937]  But it needs to happen because, you know, I talked about the studies with Robert Epstein.
[01:54:42.937 --> 01:54:50.079]  The algorithmic placement, and by the way, we've got some clips which we can play in the next segment of the CEO of the ADL.
[01:54:51.044 --> 01:54:59.619]  Former Obama advisor, top advisor Greenblatt, admitting that they have access to change the algorithm and have done to censor, quote, conspiracy theories.
[01:55:00.171 --> 01:55:01.092]  So that's what you're saying.
[01:55:01.092 --> 01:55:07.497]  We have the New York Times, we have the ADL, we now have this News Guard admitting it's controlled by Microsoft to watch what you do in live time.
[01:55:07.497 --> 01:55:11.321]  And now England, the next story, bans quote free porn.
[01:55:11.321 --> 01:55:22.210]  No, big porn got with them to make everybody go through a government ID where you pay a license like to the BBC to watch TV, where the government then controls and watches what porn you look at.
[01:55:22.210 --> 01:55:23.992]  That's beyond 1984, Paul.
[01:55:23.992 --> 01:55:24.913]  That is insane!
[01:55:25.413 --> 01:55:30.259]  Well, as he said, it's to create the Internet ID, to create that database.
[01:55:30.259 --> 01:55:32.822]  You know, we're not advocating that because porn is horrible.
[01:55:32.822 --> 01:55:33.983]  Like, it shrinks your brain.
[01:55:33.983 --> 01:55:36.126]  It makes me not enjoy sex as much.
[01:55:36.126 --> 01:55:38.509]  I'm a real third dimensional person.
[01:55:38.509 --> 01:55:39.330]  It's really horrible.
[01:55:39.330 --> 01:55:40.791]  People shouldn't really be watching it anyway.
[01:55:40.791 --> 01:55:42.013]  But, you know, we're libertarians.
[01:55:42.193 --> 01:55:56.587]  But again, they know that people are addicted, they're going to do it, and so the government is going to sell you an ID where they watch what porn you look at, so when you're in the jack shack, the MI6 and the Democrats, who get access to everything, are going to look over that?
[01:55:56.587 --> 01:55:58.149]  That's going to kill porn.
[01:55:58.149 --> 01:56:03.133]  If porn wasn't already dead because of the free market and the decentralization, this is going to kill it.
[01:56:03.133 --> 01:56:05.516]  God Almighty, the boldness of that football!
[01:56:06.380 --> 01:56:07.381]  Well, there are ways around it.
[01:56:07.381 --> 01:56:08.641]  Obviously, just use a VPN.
[01:56:08.641 --> 01:56:14.024]  It's not rocket science, but... Yeah, it's to create this Chinese-style Internet ID system, where... That's it.
[01:56:14.024 --> 01:56:15.925]  They get you to opt into the social network.
[01:56:15.925 --> 01:56:24.690]  That's the real evil, is you get your porn, just give us your ID to the government, and pay us a fee, and we're gonna watch what you jack off to.
[01:56:24.690 --> 01:56:26.451]  And then next, it'll be more, more, more.
[01:56:26.451 --> 01:56:28.212]  This is the model for the whole Internet takeover.
[01:56:28.871 --> 01:56:41.859]  And then, how the Chinese credit system works is, if you're friends with the person who's been watching some, you know, certain types of porn, then you're implicated in their behavior, and your social credit score gets relatively diminished as well.
[01:56:41.859 --> 01:56:48.423]  Well, they've gotten away with incredible surveillance and illegal spying, and the fact that we put up with it now, it just allows this.
[01:56:48.423 --> 01:56:51.564]  And again, I'm not a porn guy, folks, I'm sorry.
[01:56:51.564 --> 01:56:53.446]  Back when I was about 15 years old, man,
[01:56:54.366 --> 01:56:57.889]  And I watched Debbie Dead Dallas or New Wave Hookers.
[01:56:57.889 --> 01:56:59.089]  I thought it was the best thing I ever saw.
[01:56:59.089 --> 01:57:05.414]  But once I bit into the real thing and then you have a wife and you have children, it's about life, it's about love.
[01:57:05.414 --> 01:57:06.334]  It's not what I saw.
[01:57:06.334 --> 01:57:08.296]  I'm not here defending porn.
[01:57:08.296 --> 01:57:09.156]  This isn't porn.
[01:57:09.156 --> 01:57:16.701]  This is the top porn companies working with government to cut off all their competition and then surveil everyone while they're watching porn.
[01:57:16.701 --> 01:57:21.485]  I couldn't think of something more nightmarish and it's already law and implements in just a few days.
[01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:24.917]  Yeah, and it's all tied back to the Chinese social credit score.
[01:57:24.917 --> 01:57:31.023]  Now, 17 million Chinese citizens have been prevented from buying plane tickets just over the last year, Alex.
[01:57:31.023 --> 01:57:32.204]  That's where this is going.
[01:57:32.204 --> 01:57:34.366]  Yeah, so it's going right to the worst, mark of the beast level.
[01:57:34.366 --> 01:57:36.408]  By the way, I didn't plug this whole hour for products.
[01:57:36.408 --> 01:57:38.890]  InfoWarsTore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:40.191]  Huge sales are about to end.

[01:57:47.403 --> 01:58:00.813]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:58:00.813 --> 01:58:11.861]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:58:13.166 --> 01:58:15.093]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:58:15.093 --> 01:58:17.762]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:58:19.138 --> 01:58:23.460]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:27.703]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:58:27.703 --> 01:58:29.984]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:58:29.984 --> 01:58:32.306]  This country is in a war!
[01:58:32.306 --> 01:58:43.012]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:58:43.012 --> 01:58:46.594]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:58:57.645 --> 01:59:06.669]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:59:06.669 --> 01:59:16.732]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:59:16.732 --> 01:59:25.276]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:59:26.096 --> 01:59:27.456]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:59:27.456 --> 01:59:28.596]  You must experience it.
[01:59:28.596 --> 01:59:30.557]  It is a total game changer.
[01:59:30.557 --> 01:59:35.598]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:59:35.598 --> 01:59:37.118]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:59:37.118 --> 01:59:38.598]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:59:38.598 --> 01:59:45.279]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.

[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:53.881]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:01.272 --> 02:00:09.238]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.238 --> 02:00:13.081]  I'm just an average man with an average life.
[02:00:13.081 --> 02:00:15.003]  I work from 9 to 5.
[02:00:15.003 --> 02:00:16.904]  Hell, I'd pay the price.
[02:00:16.904 --> 02:00:22.949]  Well, we got Paul Watson wearing a LBJ Open Road Stetson.
[02:00:22.949 --> 02:00:24.990]  Looks pretty slick on you, my friend.
[02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:26.812]  Are you not going to play the old video?
[02:00:26.812 --> 02:00:27.252]  Are you from 2005?
[02:00:27.252 --> 02:00:28.133]  Did you give it to him?
[02:00:30.168 --> 02:00:31.790]  Yeah, it's easy.
[02:00:31.790 --> 02:00:34.353]  It's Real Texas Cowboys.
[02:00:34.353 --> 02:00:36.195]  RealTexasCowboysInfoWars.com.
[02:00:36.195 --> 02:00:39.299]  Do you guys have that?
[02:00:39.299 --> 02:00:40.420]  Yeah, they got it.
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:44.645]  Alright, some stations don't carry this segment, so this is a good place to play this.
[02:00:44.645 --> 02:00:46.808]  That's why I wore this cowboy hat in.
[02:00:46.808 --> 02:00:48.389]  Here's the deal.
[02:00:48.389 --> 02:00:50.031]  I do have a piece of a couple hundred cattle.
[02:00:50.993 --> 02:00:53.195]  And I do have a piece of a couple of oil wells and gas wells.
[02:00:53.195 --> 02:00:54.396]  Don't make that much money off of it.
[02:00:54.396 --> 02:01:03.404]  But you can say as a Texan, you know, I've been founding family on both sides and whole nine yards and got cattle and got oil wells and all the rest of it.
[02:01:03.404 --> 02:01:05.686]  And I don't wear these Stetsons.
[02:01:05.686 --> 02:01:08.268]  But then my grandfather always wore the silver belly.
[02:01:08.268 --> 02:01:09.529]  And you're wearing that gray one.
[02:01:09.529 --> 02:01:11.050]  That's an open road.
[02:01:11.050 --> 02:01:11.691]  But it's funny.
[02:01:11.691 --> 02:01:16.335]  Once we put a hat on you like 15 years ago, this is what 15 years ago, isn't it, Paul?
[02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:16.615]  Yeah.
[02:01:16.615 --> 02:01:16.635]  2005.
[02:01:16.635 --> 02:01:16.976]  So almost.
[02:01:18.965 --> 02:01:20.146]  So we made the joke.
[02:01:20.146 --> 02:01:21.907]  Just wear it a little bit further down on your head.
[02:01:21.907 --> 02:01:23.027]  We made the joke.
[02:01:23.027 --> 02:01:24.088]  There you go.
[02:01:24.088 --> 02:01:29.190]  We made the joke about how Bush was a real cowboy, like the platypus is from Texas.
[02:01:29.190 --> 02:01:32.332]  So here it is.
[02:01:32.332 --> 02:01:33.833]  And that's an exciting video.
[02:01:33.833 --> 02:01:36.034]  Infowars.com, Satire Theatre Presents.
[02:01:37.236 --> 02:01:39.358]  Bush, now he's a real Texan.
[02:01:39.358 --> 02:01:45.122]  We talked to two other authentic Texans who are big fans of George Bush.
[02:01:45.122 --> 02:01:47.484]  They even have cowboy hats to prove it.
[02:01:47.484 --> 02:01:49.726]  Come on in, boys.
[02:01:49.726 --> 02:01:50.967]  Is this not edited?
[02:01:50.967 --> 02:01:52.529]  What you doing, boy?
[02:01:52.529 --> 02:01:54.450]  I'm just talking to my boys.
[02:01:54.450 --> 02:01:55.371]  This is my land.
[02:01:55.371 --> 02:01:57.352]  This is my land.
[02:01:57.352 --> 02:01:59.054]  You're on my land, boy.
[02:01:59.054 --> 02:02:01.476]  What I say goes here, boy.
[02:02:01.476 --> 02:02:03.858]  You play by my rules and respect my hard time.
[02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:09.699]  Don't you dare criticize our president, boy!
[02:02:09.699 --> 02:02:10.920]  He's our leader, boy!
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:16.783]  I associate George W. Bush with my daddy.
[02:02:16.783 --> 02:02:21.005]  Just like his daddy was my daddy before he was his daddy.
[02:02:21.005 --> 02:02:21.986]  He's my daddy.
[02:02:21.986 --> 02:02:23.906]  What you talking about, boy?
[02:02:23.906 --> 02:02:24.707]  I'm your daddy!
[02:02:24.707 --> 02:02:27.868]  You don't kiss those boots, boy!
[02:02:27.868 --> 02:02:30.130]  You better respect my authority, this is my party!
[02:02:30.130 --> 02:02:30.850]  I'm the sheriff!
[02:02:32.438 --> 02:02:34.019]  Oh my God, it goes on from there.
[02:02:34.019 --> 02:02:36.041]  That's not the full clip.
[02:02:36.041 --> 02:02:37.102]  Well, they beat me up.
[02:02:37.102 --> 02:02:40.004]  Why the hell did you guys end that?
[02:02:40.004 --> 02:02:40.885]  Oh my God.
[02:02:40.885 --> 02:02:42.607]  Before the show ends, we're going to air this.
[02:02:42.607 --> 02:02:44.128]  This is solid country gold.
[02:02:44.128 --> 02:02:48.552]  That's your brother, the reclusive Steve Watson, just as smart as you are.
[02:02:48.552 --> 02:02:52.355]  That was 2005 and that, you know, we're called right wing.
[02:02:52.355 --> 02:02:55.538]  We were railing against George W. Bush before it was cool to do so, right?
[02:02:55.538 --> 02:02:56.979]  And yet we're still labeled as right wing.
[02:02:58.283 --> 02:03:00.064]  Uh, just give me a high five.
[02:03:00.064 --> 02:03:01.764]  Don't tell me that gold ends there.
[02:03:01.764 --> 02:03:03.645]  We have the rest of where they beat me up, right?
[02:03:03.645 --> 02:03:08.266]  Okay, well, we're going to air this hidden jewel at the end of the hour.
[02:03:08.266 --> 02:03:12.168]  Because this is a hidden jewel.
[02:03:12.168 --> 02:03:19.730]  You know, you're open road, you kind of look, which is a cool thing, you kind of look like you're an Orthodox Jew.
[02:03:19.730 --> 02:03:20.570]  I'll take it, Alex.
[02:03:20.570 --> 02:03:21.271]  I'll take it.
[02:03:21.271 --> 02:03:23.191]  It's good.
[02:03:23.191 --> 02:03:24.992]  Hey, I got three kids that are part Jewish.
[02:03:26.352 --> 02:03:34.476]  I never thought I was getting into that, that my ex-wife was I guess like a quarter Jewish, but some of her family was actually Jewish.
[02:03:34.476 --> 02:03:39.618]  And then it turned this whole hate monger thing, and my kids and all the names they get called, it's not very nice.
[02:03:39.618 --> 02:03:43.319]  It kind of gives you an example of the other end of what Jews go through.
[02:03:43.319 --> 02:03:46.381]  And then I get the whole leftist Jews attacking me, calling me a Nazi with no evidence.
[02:03:46.381 --> 02:03:46.981]  It gets a little old.
[02:03:47.964 --> 02:03:51.905]  Yes, crazy Alex, but thinking about that video, just think how far we've come since 2005.
[02:03:51.905 --> 02:03:58.387]  What, there was me, my brother, like a couple of other employees in a little rinky-dink office.
[02:03:58.387 --> 02:04:02.268]  Your studio was like the size, what, like a quarter of the size of this?
[02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:07.510]  You were actually in our new studio 15 years ago, but we were only in for five years before we moved here.
[02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:08.190]  Yeah.
[02:04:08.190 --> 02:04:09.090]  So yeah, that was it.
[02:04:09.090 --> 02:04:09.570]  Yeah.
[02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:14.572]  And so this whole operation now, which they're trying to drag down every available opportunity, but just to compare the two,
[02:04:15.385 --> 02:04:22.933]  It must shock you, that growth, because it's not that long ago that it was an actual rinky-dink operation, and now look at the size of it.
[02:04:22.933 --> 02:04:23.394]  What do you feel?
[02:04:23.394 --> 02:04:25.055]  Well, that's when they got scared and shut us down.
[02:04:25.055 --> 02:04:27.458]  We really had 87 million viewers.
[02:04:27.458 --> 02:04:33.264]  Not hits, but people that dialed into audio or video on the sites the week of the election, 2016.
[02:04:33.264 --> 02:04:34.385]  And so we were the top thing.
[02:04:35.046 --> 02:04:36.447]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:04:58.690 --> 02:05:00.071]  X2's back.
[02:05:00.071 --> 02:05:01.813]  The original X2.
[02:05:01.813 --> 02:05:04.736]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[02:05:04.736 --> 02:05:05.837]  What you want.
[02:05:05.837 --> 02:05:06.938]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:06.938 --> 02:05:08.379]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:05:08.379 --> 02:05:09.941]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[02:05:09.941 --> 02:05:10.902]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:10.902 --> 02:05:12.703]  With the best iodine in the world.
[02:05:12.703 --> 02:05:13.845]  X2, it's available.
[02:05:13.845 --> 02:05:14.845]  I thought X3's great.
[02:05:14.845 --> 02:05:17.028]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[02:05:17.028 --> 02:05:18.849]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[02:05:18.849 --> 02:05:19.770]  The scientists that do that.
[02:05:19.770 --> 02:05:22.012]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[02:05:22.853 --> 02:05:27.215]  Well, I was resigned to the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:05:27.215 --> 02:05:31.316]  We now have X2 again at InfoWarsTore.com, so hallelujah!
[02:05:31.316 --> 02:05:43.001]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:05:43.001 --> 02:05:51.604]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,
[02:05:52.634 --> 02:05:55.876]  Get yours today at MFORESTORE.COM or MFORESTLIFE.COM
[02:06:24.096 --> 02:06:50.969]  Let's go to Lucondock, Texas With Waylon and Willie and the boys This successful life we're living Got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCoys Between Hank Williams' pain songs And Blueberry's train songs And Blue Eyes crying in the rain
[02:06:52.658 --> 02:07:00.325]  Okay, coming up today during the war room, 3 to 6 p.m., about halfway into it.
[02:07:00.325 --> 02:07:04.509]  Do it this way, document cam shot.
[02:07:14.346 --> 02:07:20.528]  We are going to do an Ask Me Anything with Paul Joseph Watson and myself.
[02:07:20.528 --> 02:07:23.589]  We'll both take questions the second half of the War Room, March 5th.
[02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:27.690]  Come in a few hours at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:07:27.690 --> 02:07:28.770]  That's all coming up.
[02:07:28.770 --> 02:07:37.452]  You know, Paul, I want to get into all the news, but I think it's important for listeners from a cultural perspective all over the world to realize how far we've come.
[02:07:37.452 --> 02:07:39.593]  There we were 14, 15 years ago.
[02:07:39.593 --> 02:07:40.793]  We just showed the video earlier.
[02:07:40.793 --> 02:07:43.554]  We'll play the full video at the end of this hour.
[02:07:46.914 --> 02:07:57.969]  Having fun, joking around, talking about what a fake Texan George W. Bush was and how he was as big a Texan as a platypus from Australia or New Zealand.
[02:07:57.969 --> 02:08:02.075]  But talking about you, because you're a very introverted guy.
[02:08:03.032 --> 02:08:05.274]  I'll put a cowboy hat on you a little bit wilder.
[02:08:05.274 --> 02:08:11.658]  But where you thought we were 18, 19 years ago when we first started working together, we were like 18 years old, you're 35 years old now.
[02:08:11.658 --> 02:08:14.420]  It's going to be 20 years now we've been working together.
[02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:15.341]  Almost 19, 20 years.
[02:08:15.341 --> 02:08:25.969]  And just, the good news is, globalism was being set up and no one even knew about it and they ridiculed anybody that talked about it and they had the whole corporate media behind it and they thought they'd get it done.
[02:08:25.969 --> 02:08:29.331]  And so now we see the censorship and the attacks and all the things that are happening.
[02:08:29.331 --> 02:08:30.732]  We think, oh my God, we're getting our ass kicked.
[02:08:30.732 --> 02:08:30.873]  No!
[02:08:31.937 --> 02:08:34.903]  They're coming after us out in the open because we've been successful.
[02:08:34.903 --> 02:08:36.806]  So as long as we hold the line, I think we win, Paul.
[02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:39.290]  Well, they're freaking out, Alex.
[02:08:39.290 --> 02:08:40.430]  They are freaking out.
[02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:42.771]  I mean, we've got some clips from this guy, Greenblatt.
[02:08:42.771 --> 02:08:45.653]  And again, he's talking about censoring social media.
[02:08:45.653 --> 02:08:49.255]  They've got access, inside access, to the Google algorithm.
[02:08:49.255 --> 02:08:50.455]  We've talked about YouTube.
[02:08:50.455 --> 02:08:56.058]  They've ranked their own search results to the extent that they've broken their own search engine.
[02:08:56.058 --> 02:09:04.762]  So now you can specifically search for an exact headline of a video inside quotes, and it comes up on page four, buried beneath the wall of CNN.
[02:09:04.762 --> 02:09:05.623]  So here's this guy.
[02:09:06.423 --> 02:09:09.545]  I don't know if you want to go to this now, but we got the... Sure, whatever you want, call to the clips.
[02:09:09.545 --> 02:09:10.225]  We got the clip.
[02:09:10.225 --> 02:09:11.406]  This is the green-black clip.
[02:09:11.406 --> 02:09:15.729]  There are two, and first he outlines how they've got inside access to the algorithms.
[02:09:15.729 --> 02:09:22.233]  Then in the second clip, he says the conspiracy theories they need to ban are basically criticism of George Soros.
[02:09:22.233 --> 02:09:24.894]  So let's go to the first one.
[02:09:24.894 --> 02:09:30.658]  We work with Google on using AI to try to interrupt cyber hate before it happens.
[02:09:31.670 --> 02:09:42.212]  We work with YouTube to get them to change their algorithms so it lessens the likelihood that a young person is going to run into some of these anti-Semitic conspiratorial videos.
[02:09:42.212 --> 02:09:52.894]  We work with Facebook on trying to use a redirect method so when you search for Holocaust as a hoax, you get directed to like a Yad Vashem page.
[02:09:52.894 --> 02:10:00.015]  So there are different ways they can tweak their algorithms and adjust their products so they think not only about free speech,
[02:10:01.699 --> 02:10:06.995]  Not only protect a user's right to free speech, but protect a user's right to not be harassed or hated.
[02:10:07.808 --> 02:10:14.233]  They've done some good things to deal with very specific cases by taking swifter action when people perpetrate homosexuality.
[02:10:14.233 --> 02:10:15.434]  Hit pause real quick.
[02:10:15.434 --> 02:10:18.177]  And back it up ten seconds so we don't cut this off.
[02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:19.858]  And again, they use Nazis.
[02:10:19.858 --> 02:10:26.003]  And then they project Nazis onto Laura Loomer or onto Trump or on anybody else and they do this.
[02:10:26.003 --> 02:10:30.046]  This is private groups in AI watching what you do.
[02:10:30.046 --> 02:10:30.967]  It's so creepy.
[02:10:30.967 --> 02:10:31.808]  It's so evil.
[02:10:31.808 --> 02:10:32.949]  It's so entitled.
[02:10:32.949 --> 02:10:34.470]  It's so sickening.
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:44.842]  And notice, Alex, he said not only would they have access to the algorithm to relegate certain content, he said they would redirect links to their own website.
[02:10:44.842 --> 02:10:52.924]  So they're literally talking about if you click on an Infowars.com link from Google, if it's still listed on Google, that will then redirect to the ADL's hate website.
[02:10:52.924 --> 02:10:54.404]  That's literally what they're going for.
[02:10:54.404 --> 02:10:56.505]  And so what they're saying is we're going to steal your will.
[02:10:57.325 --> 02:10:58.526]  You want to go to a website?
[02:10:58.526 --> 02:10:58.826]  No!
[02:10:58.826 --> 02:11:04.150]  You come to us, and then the ADL supports the Arab Spring, and all this evil.
[02:11:04.150 --> 02:11:04.890]  God!
[02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:09.193]  This guy's Obama's former special advisor, so he's high up.
[02:11:09.193 --> 02:11:12.555]  And again, I've searched for Infowars articles.
[02:11:12.555 --> 02:11:20.280]  Whenever I write a new article about a similar subject, say mass migration or whatever, obviously I remember the titles of previous articles I've written.
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:24.143]  Go to search them in Google, and they're often not even there.
[02:11:24.143 --> 02:11:25.324]  Sometimes I have to go to some
[02:11:27.866 --> 02:11:31.849]  And that's why you know it's powerful.
[02:11:31.849 --> 02:11:33.030]  So let's continue with the clip.
[02:11:33.030 --> 02:11:37.815]  Here it is.
[02:11:37.815 --> 02:11:44.621]  Washington, you know, there's a gap in the legal regime.
[02:11:45.529 --> 02:11:49.551]  There are techniques that extremists have used online to terrorize people.
[02:11:49.551 --> 02:11:50.031]  Techniques?
[02:11:50.031 --> 02:11:51.011]  Like being popular?
[02:11:51.011 --> 02:11:57.954]  Like doxing, and swatting, and different types of hyper-bullying that are not covered by existing laws and need to be.
[02:11:57.954 --> 02:12:02.936]  Because, you know, the school principal says, well, it's not really bullying because no one really knows.
[02:12:04.218 --> 02:12:04.478]  Right?
[02:12:04.478 --> 02:12:09.304]  But in fact, the abuse online can be far, far worse than anything physical.
[02:12:09.304 --> 02:12:13.770]  So, you know, we need legislators to catch up and to fill some of the gaps.
[02:12:13.770 --> 02:12:18.936]  So America defeated the Nazis and now people use the Nazis to use Nazi tactics on us, Paul.
[02:12:19.704 --> 02:12:27.027]  Yeah, and in the second clip, which we can go to, he outlines directly what is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.
[02:12:27.027 --> 02:12:29.088]  It's criticizing George Soros.
[02:12:29.088 --> 02:12:29.808]  Let's be clear.
[02:12:29.808 --> 02:12:33.850]  You've got all these Muslim members of Congress saying Israel shouldn't exist.
[02:12:33.850 --> 02:12:34.950]  We don't agree with that.
[02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:36.291]  We're not anti-Israel.
[02:12:36.291 --> 02:12:37.111]  We get attacked.
[02:12:37.671 --> 02:12:42.714]  I mean, even Netanyahu's son got called anti-Semitic for criticizing Soros.
[02:12:42.714 --> 02:12:44.716]  Soros is an anti-Israel scumbag.
[02:12:44.716 --> 02:12:50.180]  Whether you're for Israel or against it, the point is that we're just pro-America and now they're doing this to us.
[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:53.602]  Here's the next clip.
[02:12:53.602 --> 02:12:55.783]  It's a remarkable moment that we're in.
[02:12:55.783 --> 02:12:59.726]  Anti-Semitism has become so mainstreamed.
[02:12:59.726 --> 02:13:01.907]  I mean, we see conspiracy theories.
[02:13:02.941 --> 02:13:04.462]  By the universities.
[02:13:04.462 --> 02:13:10.146]  The horrific slander directed against George Soros is a really good example.
[02:13:10.146 --> 02:13:14.328]  George Soros is patient zero for the anti-Semites.
[02:13:14.328 --> 02:13:26.736]  What they've done is use social media to normalize this kind of hate in ways that heretofore were impossible to imagine.
[02:13:26.736 --> 02:13:31.219]  And so what is so challenging and so paradoxical is we expect our leaders to lead.
[02:13:32.552 --> 02:13:37.575]  And yet the president, rather than calling this out, and other political figures too, by the way.
[02:13:37.575 --> 02:13:40.436]  Because we need leaders to lead on college campuses.
[02:13:40.436 --> 02:13:44.698]  We need leaders to lead in all political environments.
[02:13:44.698 --> 02:13:46.880]  And redirect your searches to us.
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:48.581]  And repeating this rhetoric.
[02:13:48.581 --> 02:13:50.121]  Only read what I say.
[02:13:50.121 --> 02:13:55.144]  The symptom has gone from being a bug in the system to a prevailing part of the social context.
[02:13:55.144 --> 02:13:56.745]  Because the left and Soros funded it!
[02:13:58.507 --> 02:14:06.074]  Yeah, and now it's to the level where, as you said earlier, we've got Tom Watson, potential next PM of Britain, directly demanding YouTube take this down.
[02:14:06.074 --> 02:14:09.778]  So this is not, oh, it's a private... When we come back, I don't want to just mention this.
[02:14:09.778 --> 02:14:11.079]  This is so huge.
[02:14:11.079 --> 02:14:18.105]  You've got the guy, said to be the next PM, the guy, the shadow head of internet, saying you're going to ban Paul Watson, everybody else, or any semites.
[02:14:18.105 --> 02:14:19.987]  You've got a lawsuit against this guy.
[02:14:19.987 --> 02:14:20.588]  What the hell?
[02:14:20.588 --> 02:14:21.429]  We're not against Israel.
[02:14:22.691 --> 02:14:25.933]  Yeah, so again, this is... But if we had a right to do it, we would be!
[02:14:25.933 --> 02:14:27.754]  But they're the one bringing in radical Muslims!
[02:14:27.754 --> 02:14:32.077]  This isn't, oh, it's just, it's a free market, it's a private company, they can do what they want.
[02:14:32.077 --> 02:14:38.061]  This is the government saying, you will ban nationalists, or we will shut your ass down!
[02:14:38.061 --> 02:14:43.665]  Just like they did with us, with Ted Deutsch and Quigley, in the hearings before we got banned, right?
[02:14:43.665 --> 02:14:48.788]  Exactly, they said, Paul Watson's number one, he put out fake news saying a Muslim ran over people in New York.
[02:14:48.788 --> 02:14:50.309]  It was a Muslim screaming, Allah Akbar!
[02:14:50.769 --> 02:14:51.910]  Yeah, and the story was bad.
[02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:54.892]  But your crime was you were number one, and these guys are control freaks.
[02:14:54.892 --> 02:14:56.193]  They're like, well, I'm number one.
[02:14:56.193 --> 02:15:07.061]  Which again shows how fake news is used as an excuse to silence free speech, because that story was Imam Tawhidi warning de Blasio in New York about radicalization in mosques in New York before that attack.
[02:15:07.061 --> 02:15:07.862]  Did he warn him?
[02:15:07.862 --> 02:15:08.202]  Yes.
[02:15:08.202 --> 02:15:09.063]  Did he send a letter?
[02:15:09.063 --> 02:15:09.463]  Yes.
[02:15:09.463 --> 02:15:11.065]  That was a real news story.
[02:15:11.065 --> 02:15:12.205]  They said, this is fake news.
[02:15:12.205 --> 02:15:13.386]  It's at the top of Twitter.
[02:15:13.386 --> 02:15:14.127]  Take it down.
[02:15:14.127 --> 02:15:15.168]  Within an hour, it was gone.
[02:15:15.828 --> 02:15:17.593]  Working hand-in-hand with lawmakers.
[02:15:17.593 --> 02:15:19.798]  That is not just a private company argument.
[02:15:19.798 --> 02:15:20.880]  Well, I'll tell you, you know...
[02:15:22.359 --> 02:15:25.721]  I'm going to tell that ADL guy that he's the Nazi.
[02:15:25.721 --> 02:15:27.462]  He's supporting the EU that was a Nazi project.
[02:15:27.462 --> 02:15:28.683]  He's supporting tyranny.
[02:15:28.683 --> 02:15:29.564]  You're the damn Nazi dude.
[02:15:29.564 --> 02:15:34.167]  Don't you point your finger at me when both my grandfathers almost died fighting Hitler and I'm an American.
[02:15:34.167 --> 02:15:35.748]  You son of a bitch.
[02:15:35.748 --> 02:15:41.271]  And you support that Nazi collaborator George Soros and you point your filthy finger at me and say I'm a Nazi.

[02:17:00.127 --> 02:17:05.189]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:17:05.189 --> 02:17:12.373]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:17:12.373 --> 02:17:16.935]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:17:17.515 --> 02:17:21.158]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:17:21.158 --> 02:17:24.301]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:17:24.301 --> 02:17:26.923]  It hit me when I was arrested.

[02:19:59.306 --> 02:20:11.228]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.228 --> 02:20:13.609]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:13.609 --> 02:20:19.130]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:24.071]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson's in studio with us right now.
[02:20:26.698 --> 02:20:28.498]  Let's see how my brain works, Paul is.
[02:20:28.498 --> 02:20:35.440]  Dinesh D'Souza had the number two documentary and the number three documentary in history, only Michael Moore above him.
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:38.261]  And they were really upset about him going in the 2016 election.
[02:20:54.611 --> 02:21:02.835]  And so they found out that he got a bunch of friends to give $23,000 that they said wasn't listed properly on federal forms until he went to jail for nine months.
[02:21:02.835 --> 02:21:06.156]  And I've got the articles right here we can show TV viewers.
[02:21:06.156 --> 02:21:10.779]  The Sousa pleads guilty in New York campaign finance case.
[02:21:10.779 --> 02:21:15.601]  Now, we have AOC Alexandria Cortez
[02:21:16.957 --> 02:21:30.946]  With $18 million in a secret pack she was running two years ago when she claimed she was this bartender and millions of dollars, not just a million, several million to her that she never declared under taxes or anywhere else.
[02:21:30.946 --> 02:21:34.729]  But don't hold your breath for her to go to prison for that.
[02:21:36.067 --> 02:21:40.608]  Except she's been threatening Democrats that if they don't play ball, they'll all be kicked out.
[02:21:40.608 --> 02:21:42.309]  And except she's super unpopular.
[02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:44.930]  So I think you've got a perfect storm here.
[02:21:44.930 --> 02:21:52.112]  We're in the same New York district where Dinesh D'Souza went to jail for nine months and was on probation for two years for doing nothing.
[02:21:52.112 --> 02:21:53.493]  You've got AOC.
[02:21:53.493 --> 02:21:54.193]  She's not Hillary.
[02:21:54.693 --> 02:21:59.677]  She doesn't get away with billions in secret slush funds and campaign donations.
[02:21:59.677 --> 02:22:08.425]  I think the Democratic Party, look at CNN, you name it, is getting ready to hit the flusher on AOC, at least if we get this out and talk about it.
[02:22:08.425 --> 02:22:15.391]  But talk about the hypocrisy, because commies and socialists never own a factory, they never build something, they never write a book.
[02:22:15.911 --> 02:22:17.933]  They just steal money, Paul.
[02:22:17.933 --> 02:22:20.415]  Like, like, Bernie Sanders!
[02:22:20.415 --> 02:22:24.079]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:22:24.079 --> 02:22:26.481]  I drive $100,000 vehicles.
[02:22:26.481 --> 02:22:28.723]  I have three $1 million homes.
[02:22:28.723 --> 02:22:30.345]  I bankrupt colleges.
[02:22:30.345 --> 02:22:32.447]  I steal people's investment.
[02:22:32.447 --> 02:22:35.049]  What I, I'm allowed to.
[02:22:35.049 --> 02:22:36.991]  I'm Bernie Sanders.
[02:22:36.991 --> 02:22:37.632]  So where does it end?
[02:22:38.462 --> 02:22:42.945]  Well, I mean, look at AOC the other day with the whole, um, eco scandal, okay?
[02:22:42.945 --> 02:22:52.570]  So she's, her campaign office in New York is a one-minute walk away from the train, and they've racked up $29,000 in Uber charges over the course of a year.
[02:22:52.570 --> 02:22:53.330]  5,000 rides.
[02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:57.373]  Yeah, and when it comes out, she's just like, oh, it's okay when we do it.
[02:22:57.373 --> 02:23:00.194]  We have to live in the modern world to create a better future world.
[02:23:00.194 --> 02:23:02.435]  But there's another breaking scandal about AOC.
[02:23:03.578 --> 02:23:06.159]  Which is a complete fake news story.
[02:23:06.159 --> 02:23:13.022]  She's tweeted that Jerry Falwell said he basically wanted to kill all Muslims at CPAC and that this is President Trump's fault.
[02:23:13.022 --> 02:23:14.302]  Orange man bad.
[02:23:14.302 --> 02:23:17.724]  This comment from Falwell did not happen at CPAC.
[02:23:17.724 --> 02:23:20.145]  You can see in the video this is not a CPAC.
[02:23:20.145 --> 02:23:21.785]  But let's expand.
[02:23:21.785 --> 02:23:25.207]  Under standard Islam, they want to kill everybody that isn't a Muslim anyway.
[02:23:27.657 --> 02:23:31.821]  Yeah, but this is obviously a guy talking about killing terrorists.
[02:23:31.821 --> 02:23:34.023]  He's talking about concealed carry permits.
[02:23:34.023 --> 02:23:35.405]  And they can play the video if they want.
[02:23:35.405 --> 02:23:36.966]  It's in a tweet of this guy.
[02:23:36.966 --> 02:23:37.767]  Yeah, cue that up.
[02:23:37.767 --> 02:23:38.308]  No, exactly.
[02:23:38.308 --> 02:23:39.449]  He's saying we'll kill terrorists.
[02:23:39.449 --> 02:23:45.795]  Now it's like... Yeah, but he slipped and said Muslims, and so she's accusing him of wanting to kill... But AOC won't even decry...
[02:23:46.656 --> 02:23:47.376]  Venezuela.
[02:23:47.376 --> 02:23:48.857]  She won't even decry ISIS.
[02:23:48.857 --> 02:23:51.737]  Yeah, and she doesn't even recognize that this is not at CPAC.
[02:23:51.737 --> 02:23:57.678]  She lies and says it's at CPAC so she can implicate the President in wanting to kill all Muslims.
[02:23:57.678 --> 02:23:58.799]  She may have even deleted this speech.
[02:23:58.799 --> 02:24:00.979]  Well, let's expand on this, Paul.
[02:24:00.979 --> 02:24:09.681]  What do you make of the Democrats and just the frothing... I think it's turning people off.
[02:24:09.681 --> 02:24:14.062]  I think we've reached... I know we haven't reached peak insanity, but I think it's now turning people off.
[02:24:15.267 --> 02:24:16.528]  That's my question.
[02:24:16.528 --> 02:24:18.049]  I sense that they're reaching for the...
[02:24:32.481 --> 02:24:49.771]  I think it was the 72 election of Nixon, I think it was that year, when again we had a very similar situation where the opposition to him was increasingly unhinged and absolutely insane.
[02:24:49.771 --> 02:24:52.693]  He had a media that was basically at war with him.
[02:24:52.693 --> 02:24:53.594]  What ended up happening?
[02:24:53.594 --> 02:24:55.415]  He won 49 out of 50 states.
[02:24:55.415 --> 02:24:56.976]  He became the president, obviously.
[02:24:57.296 --> 02:25:01.862]  So a lot of people have drawn that comparison between the 72 Nixon election and the current situation.
[02:25:01.862 --> 02:25:08.190]  Oh, I think that's where it's going, but when the battle lose the war, what if Trump sells out the establishment, then what's the point?
[02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:10.392]  Yeah, I mean that is a problem.
[02:25:10.392 --> 02:25:12.235]  But in terms of who's going to run for the Democrats...
[02:25:12.475 --> 02:25:16.979]  Michelle Obama's not going to run because she needs a physical test, and we know why she's not going to go through with that.
[02:25:16.979 --> 02:25:20.221]  But Joe Biden, if you look at all the polls... Let's be serious.
[02:25:20.221 --> 02:25:22.503]  She has the neck and face of a man.
[02:25:22.503 --> 02:25:24.045]  She has huge shoulders.
[02:25:24.045 --> 02:25:27.768]  It looks like she's got a summer sausage in her pants.
[02:25:27.768 --> 02:25:37.496]  And we're not against trannies, but it does appear, just like Obama was raised by a transsexual and is obsessed with it, that Michelle Obama is Michael, which she's called in multiple speeches, Michael.
[02:25:38.433 --> 02:25:44.980]  I mean, I've known several people who are very credible people, you know, involved in politics, and they believe exactly the same thing as you, Alex.
[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:51.468]  So, she's got, but we worked her yesterday, she has an Infowars protein bar down there, so it's all been explained.
[02:25:51.468 --> 02:25:54.471]  She's got nuts, but it's not the nuts that you're thinking about.
[02:25:54.471 --> 02:25:56.373]  Well, but, you know, we make jokes about this.
[02:25:56.373 --> 02:25:57.615]  I mean, she's a big old man.
[02:25:59.019 --> 02:26:01.920]  And seriously, I'm a libertarian.
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:03.500]  I don't hate somebody.
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:09.802]  But, I mean, the fact that she's got, you know, Alabama Black Snake down in those pants is not a bad thing.
[02:26:09.802 --> 02:26:17.945]  It's just that what weird psy-op of the elites are they so obsessed with a first lady that's a man, the kids are adopted, and I mean, that's true.
[02:26:17.945 --> 02:26:18.685]  I mean, that's fake.
[02:26:19.085 --> 02:26:24.550]  Well, I mean, why do you think Joan Rivers said, oh my God, she's a trainee, she was dead a week later?
[02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:35.139]  All I'm saying, Alex, is that when you're around the presence of men who are dressed like women, like some transgender people, they put the effort in, they can get away with looking like a woman, and you say, well, fair enough.
[02:26:35.139 --> 02:26:37.060]  But a man in a dress is a man in a dress.
[02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:40.263]  And when you're around men, you get a certain presence, a masculine presence.
[02:26:40.263 --> 02:26:41.724]  When you're around women, you get a feminine presence.
[02:26:41.724 --> 02:26:45.388]  I was talking to a former... No, it's like Michelle's like, give me some...
[02:26:46.348 --> 02:26:49.309]  Give me a beer right now, get his piano on!
[02:26:49.309 --> 02:27:00.971]  There was a former White House staffer who worked under Obama at CPAC, and she was telling me that when Michelle Obama was around, the presence, the energy, was very masculine.
[02:27:00.971 --> 02:27:02.272]  So, that's all I'm saying.
[02:27:02.272 --> 02:27:07.853]  I don't believe it, obviously, but... She just walks in like, God dammit, give me a beer, bitch!
[02:27:07.853 --> 02:27:12.594]  Now, all the polls are looking increasingly rosier for Joe Biden.
[02:27:13.334 --> 02:27:19.857]  Who is 12 to 14 points ahead of a lot of his contenders, even though he hasn't announced all his close.
[02:27:19.857 --> 02:27:23.398]  So creepy Joe Biden is in the poll position.
[02:27:23.398 --> 02:27:24.378]  Creepy Joe Biden.
[02:27:24.378 --> 02:27:29.020]  We're going to resurrect that video with the infamous compilation, which is, you know, it's got over.
[02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:31.581]  Can we pull up creepy Joe Biden, please?
[02:27:31.581 --> 02:27:37.023]  Now, again, by the way, I legitimately am allowed to think this, whether I'm right or wrong.
[02:27:37.023 --> 02:27:38.564]  I mean, it's America.
[02:27:38.564 --> 02:27:41.785]  I mean, Michelle Obama looks like a college linebacker.
[02:27:42.734 --> 02:27:43.935]  And then we haven't shown the video.
[02:27:43.935 --> 02:27:46.637]  Can you show her coming out of like where they drop their daughters off at school?
[02:27:46.637 --> 02:27:52.102]  And she comes out and it's like, I mean, everybody's seeing it's like, you know, it's banging around, it's bouncing around.
[02:27:52.102 --> 02:27:55.745]  She's like having problems getting that water hose in line.
[02:27:55.745 --> 02:27:58.828]  I mean, can we maybe find that and show that?
[02:27:58.828 --> 02:27:59.529]  Michelle Obama.
[02:27:59.529 --> 02:28:03.892]  What's the name of the video where Michelle Obama looks like she's got a... I think it's the Ellen dancing video.
[02:28:03.892 --> 02:28:05.354]  She looks like she has a rubber hose in her pants.
[02:28:06.015 --> 02:28:07.296]  Yeah, it's the Ellen dancing video.
[02:28:07.296 --> 02:28:13.861]  And again, if she's a man and Obama is married to a man, as a woman, more power to him!
[02:28:13.861 --> 02:28:15.323]  You know, we're not saying that.
[02:28:15.323 --> 02:28:17.384]  We're liberal!
[02:28:17.384 --> 02:28:19.806]  But Joe Biden is coming up strong, Alex.
[02:28:19.806 --> 02:28:23.930]  And again, it was the Washington Post that coined the name Creepy Joe Biden.
[02:28:23.930 --> 02:28:24.570]  It wasn't us.
[02:28:24.570 --> 02:28:28.914]  The Washington Post coined that in 2015 because they said he acts creepy around women.
[02:28:28.914 --> 02:28:30.395]  Well, little kids!
[02:28:30.395 --> 02:28:34.939]  Like, there's even footage of, like, the Attorney General, when he goes after his granddaughter, he pushes them away.
[02:28:35.479 --> 02:28:45.031]  And yeah, after the break I'll tell you something else interesting about Joe Biden, but... Hey, go help them here in the clip, because it's a super famous... It's like Alex Jones says Michelle Obama's a trainee.
[02:28:45.031 --> 02:28:47.013]  The video has like 80 million views.
[02:28:47.013 --> 02:28:48.735]  We'll see if we can find that.
[02:28:48.735 --> 02:28:49.456]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:49.456 --> 02:28:50.197]  Stay with us.

[02:29:00.310 --> 02:29:05.374]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.374 --> 02:29:12.559]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.559 --> 02:29:17.123]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.703 --> 02:29:21.346]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.346 --> 02:29:24.469]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:27.091]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.091 --> 02:29:28.612]  Get sober now.

[02:29:59.658 --> 02:30:02.661]  This was going to be a big loss because we couldn't get the Deep Earth Crystals anymore.

[02:30:14.735 --> 02:30:15.496]  It's been bottled.
[02:30:15.496 --> 02:30:17.198]  The labels are being put on today.

[02:31:56.107 --> 02:31:56.607]  It's simple.
[02:31:56.607 --> 02:32:02.732]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[02:32:02.732 --> 02:32:05.214]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[02:32:05.214 --> 02:32:08.857]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all great it is.
[02:32:08.857 --> 02:32:11.619]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[02:32:11.619 --> 02:32:12.720]  What is the top tumor?
[02:32:12.720 --> 02:32:14.842]  It's a bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[02:32:14.842 --> 02:32:16.763]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[02:32:16.883 --> 02:32:17.924]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[02:32:17.924 --> 02:32:19.885]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[02:32:19.885 --> 02:32:23.608]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[02:32:23.608 --> 02:32:26.630]  I'm like, uh, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.911]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[02:32:26.911 --> 02:32:28.352]  No one's ever done that.
[02:32:28.352 --> 02:32:30.273]  I said, how much does that cost per bottle?
[02:32:30.273 --> 02:32:31.194]  It costs $10.
[02:32:31.194 --> 02:32:32.695]  No one's ever done that.
[02:32:32.695 --> 02:32:34.516]  Sir, the average competitor is 3 to 5%.
[02:32:34.516 --> 02:32:35.177]  The top brand's 50%.
[02:32:35.177 --> 02:32:36.838]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[02:32:39.380 --> 02:32:42.302]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive.
[02:32:42.302 --> 02:32:42.923]  Our fish oil.
[02:32:42.923 --> 02:32:45.445]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[02:32:45.445 --> 02:32:46.525]  My children take it.
[02:32:46.525 --> 02:32:50.849]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[02:32:50.849 --> 02:32:53.871]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[02:32:53.871 --> 02:32:54.331]  Never!
[02:32:54.331 --> 02:32:59.315]  Inforestware.com.
[02:32:59.315 --> 02:33:01.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.982 --> 02:33:17.965]  Let me tell you how it will be.
[02:33:17.965 --> 02:33:24.648]  There's one for you, nineteen for me.
[02:33:24.648 --> 02:33:27.309]  Cause I'm the taxman.
[02:33:27.309 --> 02:33:34.092]  Yeah, I'm the taxman.
[02:33:34.092 --> 02:33:37.314]  Should five percent appear too small?
[02:33:39.676 --> 02:33:46.379]  By the way, I'm done with this subject, but Michelle Obama looks like an NFL linebacker.
[02:33:46.379 --> 02:33:48.960]  The face, the shoulders.
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:57.424]  And then you see her walking around in public, him, and it looks like he's got, you know, four or five rolls of quarters rolling around in there.
[02:33:57.424 --> 02:34:01.726]  For TV viewers, let's roll some of that since Paul Joseph Watson brought it up here today.
[02:34:02.686 --> 02:34:08.649]  Uh, and then you've got all the other crazy footage of Joan Rivers saying, oh, she's a tranny.
[02:34:08.649 --> 02:34:14.351]  Now, now, whether that's true or not, we have a right as Americans when Joan Rivers says it to bring it up.
[02:34:14.351 --> 02:34:17.633]  Every time I raise it, like, once a year it becomes a national news item.
[02:34:17.633 --> 02:34:20.854]  Can we roll the footage of, uh, I saw it during the break.
[02:34:20.854 --> 02:34:21.915]  That was the whole point of being back.
[02:34:21.915 --> 02:34:27.737]  I'm not mad, but like, whoa, I was back there during the break and I saw the footage.
[02:34:27.737 --> 02:34:28.998]  No, not a Joan Rivers, man.
[02:34:29.878 --> 02:34:37.740]  I saw the footage of Michael Obama, Michelle Obama, walking outside whenever he's bouncing around in there.
[02:34:37.740 --> 02:34:38.921]  We'll go to rebroadcast then.
[02:34:38.921 --> 02:34:40.661]  Alright, here you go.
[02:34:40.661 --> 02:34:42.982]  This is what I'm talking about right here.
[02:34:42.982 --> 02:34:46.143]  And there's a bunch of other footage.
[02:34:46.143 --> 02:34:49.404]  So, you've got that going on, and then you've got Joan Rivers.
[02:34:49.404 --> 02:34:55.626]  Let's play Joan Rivers with audio, because we went here, we're going to show why we said this for radio and TV viewers.
[02:34:55.626 --> 02:34:56.586]  Let's go ahead and roll that audio.
[02:34:57.654 --> 02:35:01.395]  Do you think the United States will see the first gay president or the first woman president?
[02:35:01.395 --> 02:35:06.737]  We already have it with Obama, so let's just calm down.
[02:35:06.737 --> 02:35:12.178]  You know Michelle is a trans... I'm sorry, she's a what?
[02:35:12.178 --> 02:35:13.639]  A transgender.
[02:35:13.639 --> 02:35:14.339]  We all know.
[02:35:16.954 --> 02:35:18.796]  So again, that's not me saying that.
[02:35:18.796 --> 02:35:19.476]  That's Joe Rivers.
[02:35:19.476 --> 02:35:22.299]  But whenever I raise it, like once a year, it becomes a huge issue.
[02:35:22.299 --> 02:35:23.260]  They never show the clip.
[02:35:23.260 --> 02:35:24.581]  They say I made it up.
[02:35:24.581 --> 02:35:26.162]  Paul, let's put bookends on this.
[02:35:26.162 --> 02:35:27.484]  I'm tired of talking about it, but you brought it up.
[02:35:28.154 --> 02:35:29.275]  Well, we can segue, Alex.
[02:35:29.275 --> 02:35:32.196]  You were talking about transgender issues.
[02:35:32.196 --> 02:35:37.560]  You were talking about the Islam thing earlier, where they literally go out and protest the school.
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:46.985]  600 Muslim parents withdraw their kids from the school because they're teaching LGBT to primary school children, which is up to the ages of about 5 to 10, generally speaking.
[02:35:49.927 --> 02:35:53.668]  Children that age should not be being taught any kind of sexuality whatsoever.
[02:35:53.668 --> 02:35:54.649]  That's the number one.
[02:35:54.649 --> 02:35:56.049]  So good for the Muslims?
[02:35:56.049 --> 02:35:56.889]  Good for them.
[02:35:56.889 --> 02:36:01.931]  But then, how do they treat people who criticize LGBT, who are not Muslims?
[02:36:01.931 --> 02:36:05.852]  I have an article here, a man investigated by police for retweeting transgender limerick.
[02:36:05.852 --> 02:36:08.533]  He didn't even retweet it, from what I've learned.
[02:36:08.533 --> 02:36:09.934]  He liked the tweet.
[02:36:09.934 --> 02:36:12.355]  He didn't even write the tweet.
[02:36:12.355 --> 02:36:14.035]  He didn't even write the limerick.
[02:36:14.035 --> 02:36:16.116]  It wasn't even that offensive.
[02:36:16.116 --> 02:36:18.697]  They called him up, they called up his employee and said,
[02:36:19.517 --> 02:36:20.298]  Is this your guy?
[02:36:20.298 --> 02:36:22.120]  And it was some construction industry thing.
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:24.682]  So it's total intimidation of anybody that isn't a Muslim.
[02:36:24.682 --> 02:36:31.729]  But the police literally said, we need to investigate this because if there are transgender employees at your work site, they are now under threat.
[02:36:31.729 --> 02:36:35.252]  They told this guy he needed to, quote, change his thinking.
[02:36:35.252 --> 02:36:37.874]  But this guy got lucky, Alex, because there was another case.
[02:36:39.059 --> 02:36:45.181]  After that, like a week after that headline, you came on arrested for calling transgender activist a man.
[02:36:45.181 --> 02:37:04.406]  This was a mother of two children, one of whom is disabled I believe, and they just showed up in her kitchen, whisked her away, detained her, processed her, stole her laptop, and she hadn't got the laptop back like weeks later, for basically harassing someone by making a comment on the internet
[02:37:05.293 --> 02:37:08.274]  In which she called somebody a man as a joke.
[02:37:08.274 --> 02:37:13.937]  So again... So we have pervert police, pedophile networks, obsessed with our kids that have police power now.
[02:37:13.937 --> 02:37:14.617]  Yeah.
[02:37:14.617 --> 02:37:22.580]  So when the Muslims come out and protest against LGBT being taught to kids or being spoken about, they're listened to, obeyed, and they've withdrawn the program.
[02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:25.121]  They're going to try and bring it back, but good luck with that.
[02:37:25.121 --> 02:37:33.565]  When non-Muslims do it in the UK, they literally have hate crime, thought crime police show up... So we join Islam so the teacher doesn't rape our children?
[02:37:35.083 --> 02:37:38.645]  Well, I don't think that was the accusation, but yeah, that they, yeah.
[02:37:38.645 --> 02:37:44.827]  No, but I mean, that's where this is going, so I guess I join Islam and then they won't teach my five-year-old how to get blowjobs.
[02:37:44.827 --> 02:37:54.472]  Basically, yeah, they won't put up with child drag queens, they won't put up with any of that nonsense, but because they're a close-knit community that doesn't take any BS, they don't get trampled.
[02:37:54.472 --> 02:37:59.174]  So that's the paradox, the left's bringing them in en masse, but then they don't play along with what they're doing.
[02:37:59.895 --> 02:38:08.439]  Yeah, because the left is truly cooked, they do need... I mean, here's this Andrew Moffat guy, he's a, quote, gay man that wants to teach your five-year-olds about sex.
[02:38:08.439 --> 02:38:09.740]  That's creepy!
[02:38:09.740 --> 02:38:10.300]  Stop it!
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:20.945]  There should be no teaching of any sexuality to five-year-old kids, that is completely... They want to hear about puppies and blocks and planets and trees and fishies.
[02:38:20.945 --> 02:38:22.406]  Have you tried to talk like a five-year-old?
[02:38:22.406 --> 02:38:24.607]  Let me tell you about fisting!
[02:38:25.367 --> 02:38:32.790]  Because I've read the articles where they're like, we're going to teach you about BSDM, we're going to teach you about being another sex, and the kids are like, what?
[02:38:32.790 --> 02:38:33.871]  Do you want to be another sex?
[02:38:33.871 --> 02:38:34.751]  I guess I do.
[02:38:34.751 --> 02:38:37.673]  Your parents are cut off, you're taken away, we're sterilizing you.
[02:38:37.673 --> 02:38:40.154]  I mean, this is a perv takeover.
[02:38:40.154 --> 02:38:48.537]  The next step after that, and they do this in Sweden, they directly teach the kids, the boys, that they're not boys, and tell them they're not boys, and give them the gender option.
[02:38:48.537 --> 02:38:51.779]  And make them wear dresses, and they go, oh God, you wear a dress, you're so cool.
[02:38:52.119 --> 02:38:52.960]  No, it's not a cliché.
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:54.242]  In Sweden, I did an article.
[02:38:54.242 --> 02:38:57.968]  They literally made the boys wear dresses and told them they were... No, I know, Paul.
[02:38:57.968 --> 02:38:58.850]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:38:58.850 --> 02:38:59.951]  Alright, shifting gears out of this.
[02:39:00.776 --> 02:39:03.597]  Because we don't want to hear people say we're obsessed with this.
[02:39:03.597 --> 02:39:07.678]  I'm obsessed with the globalist obsessed with biologically screwing our kids up.
[02:39:07.678 --> 02:39:10.179]  What else is on your front burner?
[02:39:10.179 --> 02:39:12.179]  Because globalism is in trouble.
[02:39:12.179 --> 02:39:13.920]  Nationalism is awakening.
[02:39:13.920 --> 02:39:15.560]  Good things are happening overall.
[02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:17.741]  You know, AOC is about to get indicted.
[02:39:17.741 --> 02:39:21.001]  They've got all these fake investigations of Trump, none of them Russia related.
[02:39:21.001 --> 02:39:23.102]  I mean, there's good news here if we just don't give up.
[02:39:24.059 --> 02:39:28.865]  We can't give up, Alex, and we're representing people who aren't in media, who aren't even in this fight.
[02:39:28.865 --> 02:39:38.759]  We're representing ordinary people who, and this goes back to the social media aspect, this is what's frightening to me about deplatforming, which is what we should be talking about every day, all day, basically.
[02:39:39.975 --> 02:39:50.860]  Employers now in the US and the UK, 70% of employers check a potential employee's social media accounts and history before they even get to the interview stage.
[02:39:50.860 --> 02:39:56.163]  If they don't have a social media presence, it immediately raises a red flag.
[02:39:56.163 --> 02:40:05.688]  So we're literally at the point where it's not just you lose your Twitter account, it's you lose your bank account, your basic right to e-commerce, you lose the right to book a plane ticket.
[02:40:07.209 --> 02:40:13.874]  17 million Chinese citizens could not book a plane ticket in the past year because they were caught up in this social credit score system.
[02:40:13.874 --> 02:40:18.618]  So now you're going to get people who are not even going to be able to get a job, to get a loan.
[02:40:18.618 --> 02:40:21.161]  So the mark of the beast is here and it sucks.
[02:40:21.161 --> 02:40:23.963]  And a lot of people are going to say, well let me just submit.
[02:40:23.963 --> 02:40:29.568]  But like Joe Rogan talked about with me last week, once you give in at one level, it collapses.
[02:40:29.568 --> 02:40:31.109]  It's always more, more, more, more, more.
[02:40:32.591 --> 02:40:36.233]  Yeah, and it all comes back to the social ostracization angle as well.
[02:40:36.233 --> 02:40:38.215]  You know, if you're not on social media, what's wrong with you?
[02:40:38.215 --> 02:40:39.775]  There must be something wrong with you.
[02:40:39.775 --> 02:40:43.718]  And your friends get punished if you're friends with them on the social media network.
[02:40:43.718 --> 02:40:45.299]  If they misbehave, you get punished.
[02:40:45.299 --> 02:40:47.180]  Oh, I love what followers people are.
[02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:52.083]  Not our general audience, but people are like, oh, what's it like being kicked off those things?
[02:40:52.083 --> 02:40:57.867]  We have a warehouse, another company we work with, we're their main customer, and like all these employees wanted to quit.
[02:40:58.427 --> 02:41:03.072]  When they announced back in August of last year that we were banned, they said, we're going under.
[02:41:03.072 --> 02:41:05.094]  We're not on social media.
[02:41:05.094 --> 02:41:05.995]  The company's gone.
[02:41:05.995 --> 02:41:08.177]  We're like, no, your paychecks are still coming.
[02:41:08.177 --> 02:41:11.500]  But it's that idea that they have bamboozled people into.
[02:41:11.500 --> 02:41:12.001]  It's insane.
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:19.385]  Yeah, and it's basically creating a system whereby, you know, you've heard the announcements on the trains in China.
[02:41:19.385 --> 02:41:24.649]  Smoking on trains, chatting too loudly on a train, that's all going to go into your pocket.
[02:41:24.649 --> 02:41:29.392]  And again, once you submit to that, it's going to be your heart rate's too high.
[02:41:29.392 --> 02:41:31.234]  You ate the wrong thing.
[02:41:31.234 --> 02:41:34.076]  It's always more, it's seeing what we'll do.
[02:41:34.076 --> 02:41:36.158]  There's no limit to the submission.
[02:41:36.704 --> 02:41:38.385]  But you also get rewarded.
[02:41:38.385 --> 02:41:44.948]  So maybe in the future, if you have the right political opinions, your flight will get upgraded, your hotel room will get upgraded.
[02:41:44.948 --> 02:41:46.188]  It goes both ways.
[02:41:46.188 --> 02:41:48.269]  So these are corporations making their final move.
[02:41:48.269 --> 02:41:52.691]  I want to talk to you about this in the final segment before we take an hour off.
[02:41:52.691 --> 02:41:53.912]  And then we've got the war room coming up.
[02:41:53.912 --> 02:41:57.473]  We're going to co-host with Owen.
[02:41:57.473 --> 02:42:00.715]  What would the world look like, Paul, if we submitted to this?
[02:42:02.045 --> 02:42:15.488]  Basically a caste system of transhumanists, where they've got the microchip, they've got the augmentations, and the people who reject it are cast aside, not as just not being trendy, but not being able to physically operate in the world.
[02:42:15.488 --> 02:42:16.929]  Not being able to get a house.
[02:42:16.929 --> 02:42:23.010]  And the chip doesn't really up you, the system shuts everyone down and says you have a chip, now you can do what you want.
[02:42:23.010 --> 02:42:27.231]  You believe the chip gave you power, when the truth is the system cut you off.
[02:42:27.651 --> 02:42:28.291]  Yeah.
[02:42:28.291 --> 02:42:29.052]  Mark of the Beast.
[02:42:29.052 --> 02:42:37.517]  I mean, maybe it's not going to be a microchip in your forehead, but it's withdrawing the ability to operate in the real world in 2019.
[02:42:37.517 --> 02:42:40.379]  That's where we're at, Alex.
[02:42:40.379 --> 02:42:42.180]  Wow.
[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:43.521]  What a time to be alive.
[02:42:43.521 --> 02:42:44.761]  What a time to be fighting back.
[02:42:44.761 --> 02:42:49.704]  Because, Paul, once we make it past this, a real adventure begins.
[02:42:49.704 --> 02:42:50.225]  Stay with us.
[02:42:50.225 --> 02:42:51.846]  Paul Joseph Watson in studio on the ATS.
[02:42:55.146 --> 02:42:57.388]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:42:57.388 --> 02:42:59.129]  There is no set stasis.
[02:42:59.129 --> 02:43:00.370]  There is no managed system.
[02:43:00.370 --> 02:43:02.011]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:43:02.011 --> 02:43:05.253]  The continuum is always launching forward in the future.
[02:43:05.253 --> 02:43:08.595]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:43:08.595 --> 02:43:09.836]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[02:43:09.836 --> 02:43:10.556]  We'll be here forever.
[02:43:10.556 --> 02:43:11.897]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:43:11.897 --> 02:43:18.762]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[02:43:18.762 --> 02:43:19.342]  We made it.
[02:43:19.342 --> 02:43:21.503]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:43:21.503 --> 02:43:23.325]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[02:43:23.325 --> 02:43:23.685]  And so,
[02:43:23.885 --> 02:43:30.350]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:43:30.350 --> 02:43:35.414]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:43:35.414 --> 02:43:38.276]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:43:38.276 --> 02:43:40.658]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:43:40.658 --> 02:43:44.161]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[02:43:44.161 --> 02:43:45.202]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:43:45.442 --> 02:43:49.724]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[02:43:49.724 --> 02:43:52.605]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:43:52.605 --> 02:43:53.665]  I want life!
[02:43:53.665 --> 02:43:55.046]  I want Jesus!

[02:44:58.635 --> 02:45:01.677]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:45:01.677 --> 02:45:08.122]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[02:45:55.971 --> 02:45:59.733]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the falls.
[02:45:59.733 --> 02:46:01.974]  They'd have it during the winter.
[02:46:01.974 --> 02:46:04.935]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[02:46:04.935 --> 02:46:09.497]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply on the top.
[02:46:10.566 --> 02:46:19.691]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:46:19.691 --> 02:46:25.053]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[02:46:58.757 --> 02:47:01.380]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:12.981 --> 02:47:22.684]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:22.684 --> 02:47:30.506]  The poets tell how Poncho fell, and he left his livin' in cheap hotels.
[02:47:30.506 --> 02:47:38.308]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold, and so the story ends we're told.
[02:47:38.308 --> 02:47:40.809]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true,
[02:47:42.068 --> 02:47:53.712]  So Paul Joseph Watson, a knight in the fight against the globalists, reached billions of people, savaged the enemy,
[02:48:08.832 --> 02:48:09.953]  What is your ethos?
[02:48:09.953 --> 02:48:11.074]  What do you want in life?
[02:48:11.074 --> 02:48:13.556]  Who are you?
[02:48:13.556 --> 02:48:15.598]  My goal, Alex, is to win.
[02:48:15.598 --> 02:48:21.483]  You know, people in Europe are getting very black-pilled, should we say, you know, with the whole mass immigration.
[02:48:21.483 --> 02:48:24.265]  In America, you're, you know, 10, 15 years behind.
[02:48:24.265 --> 02:48:28.349]  But we still reserve hope for, you know, recovering, restoring things in America.
[02:48:29.227 --> 02:48:32.830]  And the way the media's going, Alex, is absolutely incredible.
[02:48:32.830 --> 02:48:40.716]  You talked about your Joe Rogan appearance, which now has 8.6 million views already, as much as the first appearance in the space of a week.
[02:48:40.716 --> 02:48:41.597]  Well, that's on YouTube.
[02:48:41.597 --> 02:48:43.018]  It's even bigger on, uh, yeah.
[02:48:43.018 --> 02:48:47.242]  And this is, this is why they're so afraid, Alex, because Joe Rogan is the new media.
[02:48:47.662 --> 02:48:51.584]  You know, PewDiePie does an impersonation of a news reporter.
[02:48:51.584 --> 02:48:58.329]  It gets millions and millions more views every day than Fox News and CNN gets on their primetime shows.
[02:48:58.329 --> 02:49:00.150]  That's why they're so paranoid.
[02:49:00.150 --> 02:49:08.335]  You had a guy called Shane Dawson a couple of weeks ago who just gave me a shout-out on Twitter because he said he liked conspiracy theories or whatever.
[02:49:08.803 --> 02:49:10.604]  They freaked out about that.
[02:49:10.604 --> 02:49:13.745]  This is the new media that their control is being taken away.
[02:49:13.745 --> 02:49:16.126]  They're whining about losing their jobs.
[02:49:16.126 --> 02:49:20.447]  Vice, BuzzFeed, Huffington Post, all being laid off.
[02:49:20.447 --> 02:49:21.528]  No sympathy, Alex.
[02:49:21.528 --> 02:49:25.809]  Why would anyone have sympathy for them when they've abused their platforms time and time again?
[02:49:25.809 --> 02:49:31.691]  These are authoritarian, pro-radical Islam, pro-war dirtbags with no viewers.
[02:49:31.691 --> 02:49:36.213]  But the corporations give them power and they keep thinking if they whack us on the head
[02:49:37.759 --> 02:49:38.741]  I almost wanted to keep doing it.
[02:49:38.741 --> 02:49:41.809]  I don't want to tell them a secret, but I'm all about the truths.
[02:49:41.809 --> 02:49:45.759]  They have not done what they think they've done to us.
[02:49:45.759 --> 02:49:46.821]  I'll just put it at that point.
[02:49:48.226 --> 02:49:52.550]  The state of the media is horrendous, and I've made this point many times before.
[02:49:52.550 --> 02:49:58.715]  In the past there was no competition, so all they had to do was parrot the narrative, carry on the consensus.
[02:49:58.715 --> 02:50:07.783]  Now there's so much cutthroat competition in news commentary alone, to get successful on YouTube, as you did for years before they removed your channel,
[02:50:08.464 --> 02:50:10.405]  You have to be entertaining, you have to be interesting.
[02:50:10.405 --> 02:50:15.047]  People who work for the mainstream media are not entertaining, they're not interesting, they don't want to be.
[02:50:15.047 --> 02:50:17.888]  And that's why they hate people like you.
[02:50:17.888 --> 02:50:27.873]  By the way, can we pull up Mark Dice's response to when Millie Weaver brought up to him, why are you banning Mark Dice at the CPAC?
[02:50:27.873 --> 02:50:30.114]  He goes, well I can't let him have my fame.
[02:50:31.352 --> 02:50:34.555]  He's on CNN with billions of production behind him.
[02:50:34.555 --> 02:50:36.376]  He has 100,000 viewers.
[02:50:36.376 --> 02:50:39.478]  Mark Dice could fart and he would have bigger viewers.
[02:50:39.478 --> 02:50:44.262]  It's not about who has bigger viewers, but it's like this thing of like, oh, you want to be me.
[02:50:44.262 --> 02:50:46.343]  You want like he has Promethean fire.
[02:50:46.343 --> 02:50:48.645]  He has Zeus lightning bolts.
[02:50:48.645 --> 02:50:50.927]  Dude, you don't have it.
[02:50:50.927 --> 02:50:53.228]  It's it's so pathetic.
[02:50:53.228 --> 02:50:59.193]  No, you shut down Mark Dice because he's more popular than you and he challenged you and you're a freaking coward.
[02:50:59.926 --> 02:51:15.174]  They're so paranoid about anyone not towing the line on whatever you want to call it, whatever you want to talk about, transgenderism, social justice, identity politics, that anyone who just refuses to comment on the news, just stays out of the controversies, is a massive threat.
[02:51:15.174 --> 02:51:24.419]  Like someone like Shane Dawson, like he used to make comedy videos and stuff, now he makes videos about how iPhones are spying on people, and it's kind of somewhat tongue-in-cheek and a little bit immature.
[02:51:24.419 --> 02:51:24.959]  And 20 years late.
[02:51:25.439 --> 02:51:33.625]  And 20 years late, but the very fact he's talking about it with 20 million YouTube subscribers, the very fact that you're on... They're threatened by the fact that he's independent.
[02:51:33.625 --> 02:51:33.746]  Yeah.
[02:51:33.746 --> 02:51:37.008]  And he may have been a crap-ass before, but he has a soul.
[02:51:37.008 --> 02:51:40.611]  And the minute he has the soul, he goes, wait, I got kids now.
[02:51:40.611 --> 02:51:43.893]  This is, oh no, now we're gonna bully you.
[02:51:43.893 --> 02:51:45.635]  The good news is, Paul, they can't bully us all.
[02:51:46.397 --> 02:51:48.438]  Yeah, and it comes back to what you just said.
[02:51:48.438 --> 02:51:49.258]  They have a soul.
[02:51:49.258 --> 02:51:51.099]  They haven't been bought off.
[02:51:51.099 --> 02:51:56.702]  And that's why they gravitate towards people like us, because for all our faults, we haven't been bought off either.
[02:51:56.702 --> 02:51:58.943]  They become the new media in sync with us.
[02:51:58.943 --> 02:52:01.023]  You know, there was... But that's the key, though.
[02:52:01.023 --> 02:52:02.644]  Paul, there's no price tag.
[02:52:02.644 --> 02:52:03.104]  Yeah.
[02:52:03.104 --> 02:52:04.105]  But there's, like, I am...
[02:52:05.518 --> 02:52:08.399]  My problem is the more they mess with me, the more I work and fight.
[02:52:08.399 --> 02:52:10.179]  They think it's like making me weak.
[02:52:10.179 --> 02:52:10.820]  It's the opposite.
[02:52:10.820 --> 02:52:13.841]  It's pushing me towards a heart attack, where I work 20 hours a day.
[02:52:13.841 --> 02:52:15.441]  They think it's like making me back down.
[02:52:15.441 --> 02:52:17.041]  It's the opposite!
[02:52:17.041 --> 02:52:18.622]  Do they just expect you to give up?
[02:52:18.622 --> 02:52:20.402]  Like, you're not going anywhere.
[02:52:20.402 --> 02:52:23.123]  Like, I'm not, I don't, literally don't know how to do anything else.
[02:52:23.123 --> 02:52:24.204]  I wouldn't want to.
[02:52:24.204 --> 02:52:25.804]  But we're not gonna go anywhere.
[02:52:25.804 --> 02:52:26.664]  Nothing's gonna happen.
[02:52:26.664 --> 02:52:28.365]  But imagine, they think we're like them, Paul.
[02:52:28.365 --> 02:52:28.745]  They think...
[02:52:29.460 --> 02:52:33.021]  Like, like you, like you attack me and I go away?
[02:52:33.021 --> 02:52:33.081]  No.
[02:52:33.081 --> 02:52:36.263]  No, I dream about strangling you.
[02:52:36.263 --> 02:52:44.346]  Yeah, and they were all skulking around the scenes of CPAC, you know, smacking their lips at who they're going to send to next.
[02:52:44.346 --> 02:52:45.566]  There was a Wired News story.
[02:52:45.566 --> 02:52:48.147]  It's all that pissant nobody.
[02:52:48.147 --> 02:52:49.548]  They couldn't build an audience.
[02:52:49.548 --> 02:52:49.788]  Yeah.
[02:52:49.788 --> 02:52:51.008]  They couldn't build a family.
[02:52:51.008 --> 02:52:51.989]  They couldn't build a business.
[02:52:51.989 --> 02:52:52.329]  Literally.
[02:52:52.329 --> 02:52:55.210]  But they can go around the system and going, I'll ban them.
[02:52:55.210 --> 02:52:55.670]  Yeah.
[02:52:55.670 --> 02:52:56.971]  I'll ban them.
[02:52:56.971 --> 02:52:57.691]  I'll ban them.
[02:52:58.271 --> 02:52:59.673]  Oh man, exactly.
[02:53:13.834 --> 02:53:16.696]  I don't want to be... It is like Obi-Wan Kenobi here.
[02:53:16.696 --> 02:53:23.379]  Like, Obi-Wan Kenobi could have beaten Darth Vader at that point, but he wanted to make Luke Skywalker pissed off, so he got killed.
[02:53:23.379 --> 02:53:26.281]  And I'm not even suicidal, but they don't get it, Paul.
[02:53:26.281 --> 02:53:28.022]  They don't have any understanding of history.
[02:53:28.837 --> 02:53:31.598]  Yeah, and they're working in coordination.
[02:53:31.598 --> 02:53:35.400]  They claim that they're just covering the news and covering the controversy.
[02:53:35.400 --> 02:53:37.000]  They're not covering the controversy.
[02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:41.062]  They're in direct communication with YouTube, with Facebook, with Twitter, saying, what about this?
[02:53:41.062 --> 02:53:41.522]  What about this?
[02:53:41.522 --> 02:53:41.842]  What about this?
[02:53:41.842 --> 02:53:44.804]  And they're allowed to eat illegally, because forget the free speech or any of that.
[02:53:44.804 --> 02:53:56.829]  They're allowed to eat legally, and they brag, spy on everyone in our personal accounts, racketeering, violation of privacy law, federal law, and they're all allowed to do it because they're all given intelligence shits.
[02:53:57.769 --> 02:54:01.872]  Oh, there's a Countering Disinformation and Foreign Propaganda Act.
[02:54:01.872 --> 02:54:02.893]  You're a secret agent.
[02:54:02.893 --> 02:54:05.215]  You're on the CIA now, Oliver.
[02:54:05.215 --> 02:54:06.916]  And they hand him that card.
[02:54:06.916 --> 02:54:07.516]  Does it matter?
[02:54:07.516 --> 02:54:09.478]  You're not allowed to engage in crimes against U.S.
[02:54:09.478 --> 02:54:10.619]  citizens.
[02:54:10.619 --> 02:54:11.059]  Exactly.
[02:54:11.059 --> 02:54:12.980]  We got that Mark Dice clip ready, you mentioned.
[02:54:12.980 --> 02:54:13.781]  Should we go to that?
[02:54:13.781 --> 02:54:14.622]  Let's go to Mark Dice.
[02:54:14.622 --> 02:54:15.042]  Here it is.
[02:54:19.623 --> 02:54:22.904]  Brian Stelter tried his hand at stand-up comedy the other day.
[02:54:22.904 --> 02:54:28.206]  He gave a lecture at Kent State University on media ethics.
[02:54:28.206 --> 02:54:33.048]  This is a guy whose weekend show is called Reliable Sources.
[02:54:33.048 --> 02:54:40.231]  After his lecture was over, Millie Weaver, a lovely reporter for Infowars.com, decided to ask him some questions.
[02:54:40.231 --> 02:54:43.892]  Hey Brian, so why did you block Mark Dice on Twitter?
[02:54:47.154 --> 02:54:47.634]  First of all, hi.
[02:54:47.634 --> 02:54:48.515]  Hi, nice to meet you.
[02:54:48.515 --> 02:54:49.636]  Thank you for asking questions.
[02:54:49.636 --> 02:54:50.377]  Billy Weaver.
[02:54:50.377 --> 02:54:51.077]  Brian.
[02:54:51.077 --> 02:54:51.998]  Yeah.
[02:54:51.998 --> 02:54:53.960]  They're going to kick us out in a couple minutes, but I'm happy to talk.
[02:54:53.960 --> 02:54:54.240]  Okay, sure.
[02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:55.762]  But I do want to say hi to everybody else, too.
[02:54:55.762 --> 02:54:57.103]  Let me give you a close-up.
[02:54:57.103 --> 02:54:57.844]  Oh, thank you.
[02:54:57.844 --> 02:54:59.245]  Some ideas for your show.
[02:54:59.245 --> 02:54:59.966]  Thank you.
[02:54:59.966 --> 02:55:00.466]  Awesome.
[02:55:00.466 --> 02:55:03.489]  So, why did you block our guys?
[02:55:03.489 --> 02:55:11.337]  Sometimes I block people because they're trying to gain fame and stature just by making silly jokes and attacks.
[02:55:12.057 --> 02:55:12.778]  So it's not worth it.
[02:55:12.778 --> 02:55:14.539]  He already has a big following, though.
[02:55:14.539 --> 02:55:14.839]  Yeah.
[02:55:14.839 --> 02:55:17.060]  I'd say it's, you know, he's okay.
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:18.601]  I think his videos are funny.
[02:55:18.601 --> 02:55:20.442]  You think his, do you like his parodies of you?
[02:55:20.442 --> 02:55:21.963]  I've only watched a couple, but they're pretty funny.
[02:55:21.963 --> 02:55:22.583]  Yeah.
[02:55:22.583 --> 02:55:24.864]  Okay, so- Look at how uncomfortable he is!
[02:55:24.864 --> 02:55:27.486]  Millie, you're gonna give the poor guy nightmares about me!
[02:55:28.206 --> 02:55:32.767]  Brian, if you think my voiceovers of you are funny, then why did you block me?
[02:55:32.767 --> 02:55:35.808]  You need to man up, bro, and get a sense of humor.
[02:55:35.808 --> 02:55:45.311]  Sounds to me like you're jealous that I'm just one guy on a laptop in my kitchen who's getting a quarter of the viewers of CNN's primetime shows.
[02:55:45.311 --> 02:55:55.954]  Millie went on to ask him why, if he supports the First Amendment and the rights of journalists, would CNN lobby the social media companies to get them to ban Alex Jones.
[02:55:56.254 --> 02:56:01.638]  Do you think that Twitter should unban Alex Jones and InfoWars?
[02:56:01.638 --> 02:56:02.739]  I don't know.
[02:56:02.739 --> 02:56:05.201]  I think it's a really complicated subject.
[02:56:05.201 --> 02:56:06.943]  I'm not sure what the right answer is.
[02:56:06.943 --> 02:56:10.125]  Aren't you against censorship?
[02:56:10.125 --> 02:56:13.228]  What if that slippery slope went against you, Brian?
[02:56:13.228 --> 02:56:14.989]  First of all, I love your photos.
[02:56:14.989 --> 02:56:18.492]  I think it's very smart that you both have a viral following.
[02:56:18.672 --> 02:56:19.773]  What about the question?
[02:56:19.773 --> 02:56:20.614]  Answer the question.
[02:56:20.614 --> 02:56:22.675]  What if that slippery slope wouldn't get skewed?
[02:56:22.675 --> 02:56:23.917]  What if you were the debate?
[02:56:23.917 --> 02:56:30.302]  But that's why I said I don't have a... I don't know if Facebook did the right thing or not.
[02:56:30.302 --> 02:56:31.863]  That's not for me to decide.
[02:56:31.863 --> 02:56:34.005]  That's for Facebook to decide.
[02:56:34.005 --> 02:56:37.508]  CNN has called for some social media sites to crack down on Infowars and Alex Jones.
[02:56:37.508 --> 02:56:38.669]  CNN has not called for that.
[02:56:38.669 --> 02:56:39.310]  CNN has asked.
[02:56:41.272 --> 02:56:46.558]  So, I think what Oliver did that was so smart was he just asked a really simple question.
[02:56:46.558 --> 02:56:50.403]  Do these pages violate your misinformation policy?
[02:56:50.403 --> 02:56:53.347]  And so, that's actually Facebook's responsibility, not CNN's.
[02:56:53.347 --> 02:56:54.468]  What a snake!
[02:56:54.468 --> 02:56:56.671]  I think what Oliver Darcy did was really smart!
[02:56:57.111 --> 02:57:07.656]  Oliver Darcy's the weasel who literally led the campaign to pressure the social media companies to ban Alex Jones by constantly tattling on him for what he was posting.
[02:57:07.656 --> 02:57:12.539]  Things got even worse for Brian when he was asked why he blocked me on Twitter again!
[02:57:12.539 --> 02:57:14.600]  This time by Caitlin Bennett!
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:20.222]  She's the girl whose graduation photo from Kent State went viral because she was posing with an AR-15.
[02:57:21.667 --> 02:57:24.228]  Do you, uh, do you get mad at Mark Dice often?
[02:57:24.228 --> 02:57:25.248]  Robert Mueller, what's that?
[02:57:25.248 --> 02:57:27.349]  Do you get mad at Mark Dice often?
[02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:28.510]  I don't... Why'd you block him?
[02:57:28.510 --> 02:57:36.573]  So, so... And then complain to Jack, the CEO of Twitter, that he was bullying... Alright, we gotta go to break.
[02:57:36.573 --> 02:57:43.916]  We're gonna come back and do four more minutes, and then we've got a rebroadcast, and then in an hour we're gonna do the whole war room with Paula and myself.
[02:57:43.916 --> 02:57:45.176]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.176 --> 02:57:46.557]  I've got some really good news, though.
[02:57:47.686 --> 02:57:49.047]  X2's back.
[02:57:49.047 --> 02:57:50.809]  The original X2.
[02:57:50.809 --> 02:57:51.770]  Deep Earth Crystal.
[02:57:51.770 --> 02:57:53.731]  Pure atomic iodine.
[02:57:53.731 --> 02:57:54.812]  What you want.
[02:57:54.812 --> 02:57:55.933]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:55.933 --> 02:57:57.354]  It'll be here in a week.
[02:57:57.354 --> 02:57:58.915]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[02:57:58.915 --> 02:57:59.896]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:57:59.896 --> 02:58:01.698]  With the best iodine in the world.
[02:58:01.698 --> 02:58:02.839]  X2, it's available.
[02:58:02.839 --> 02:58:03.819]  I thought X3's great.
[02:58:03.819 --> 02:58:06.021]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[02:58:06.021 --> 02:58:07.843]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[02:58:07.843 --> 02:58:08.764]  The scientists that do that.
[02:58:08.764 --> 02:58:11.005]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[02:58:11.826 --> 02:58:16.208]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[02:58:16.208 --> 02:58:20.289]  We now have X2 again, and in FullWorthStore.com, so hallelujah!
[02:58:20.289 --> 02:58:31.994]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[02:58:31.994 --> 02:58:40.597]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[03:00:05.925 --> 03:00:13.072]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.072 --> 03:00:26.926]  All right, coming up in an hour, when this show's over, we're going to co-host with Ellen Schroeder of The War Room, InfoWorks.com, Fortune Life Show, Ask Me Anything Reddit, the poll.
[03:00:27.867 --> 03:00:32.050]  We can't get into inside baseball, but we'll do some of it when we start the next show.
[03:00:32.050 --> 03:00:35.112]  Because it's so sad that Judas Iscariot stuff.
[03:00:35.112 --> 03:00:41.055]  Everyone that's worked here, they offer more and more money to just lie about us.
[03:00:41.055 --> 03:00:45.078]  You've been working with me 18, 19 years.
[03:00:45.078 --> 03:00:46.679]  We didn't script this.
[03:00:46.679 --> 03:00:48.460]  But for viewers out there, what is InfoWars?
[03:00:49.867 --> 03:01:01.134]  InfoWars is a platform that absolutely terrorizes the establishment because our only motivation, our only dependence, our only loyalty is to the listeners.
[03:01:01.977 --> 03:01:03.358]  They built us up from nothing.
[03:01:03.358 --> 03:01:04.598]  They funded us throughout this.
[03:01:04.598 --> 03:01:08.240]  They had our backs when we were almost toppled last year.
[03:01:08.240 --> 03:01:16.525]  And that's why they're so paranoid, because we don't take giant checks from Gulf state dictatorships like CNN does.
[03:01:16.525 --> 03:01:21.368]  We don't take giant checks from George Soros like, you know, Right Wing Watch does and all these other organizations.
[03:01:22.233 --> 03:01:23.733]  We can't be controlled.
[03:01:23.733 --> 03:01:35.797]  The threat of something that can't be controlled in today's society, where everything is so anodyne and so stale, from culture down to sports, down to news, down to media, whatever, that is like unheard of now.
[03:01:35.797 --> 03:01:44.140]  That is why we represent such a big threat, because... You know, I agree that we can't be bought, but beyond not being bought, who are we?
[03:01:44.140 --> 03:01:46.540]  You've known me 18, 19 years.
[03:01:46.540 --> 03:01:47.901]  I saw your writing, I hired you.
[03:01:48.641 --> 03:01:53.345]  We've known each other, you've been in the entire Maine just as much as I've been.
[03:01:53.345 --> 03:01:54.786]  What is Infowars?
[03:01:54.786 --> 03:01:56.387]  What do we stand for?
[03:01:56.387 --> 03:01:59.069]  We stand for freedom, freedom of speech.
[03:01:59.069 --> 03:02:02.672]  We stand for basic principles and values.
[03:02:02.672 --> 03:02:08.917]  We stand against the absolute insanity of identity politics that has beset the West over the past five, ten years.
[03:02:08.917 --> 03:02:11.619]  That's come to the point where we literally have the media
[03:02:12.259 --> 03:02:16.161]  Celebrating child drag queens.
[03:02:16.161 --> 03:02:18.323]  Did you ever think you'd see the day when that was happening?
[03:02:18.323 --> 03:02:20.584]  And killing babies after they're born.
[03:02:20.584 --> 03:02:28.389]  So, we stand for life and the standard biological operation of homo sapiens.
[03:02:28.389 --> 03:02:35.233]  Yeah, the basic biological coding of homo sapiens, and yet we're under the most attack.
[03:02:35.233 --> 03:02:38.235]  What could that possibly mean, Alex, about the other side?
[03:02:40.287 --> 03:02:43.170]  But let's get into negative points in the two minutes we have to break.
[03:02:43.170 --> 03:02:46.653]  We'll talk about it more because we need to be totally honest here.
[03:02:46.653 --> 03:02:47.834]  What are the faults of InfoWars?
[03:02:49.406 --> 03:02:50.687]  Um, I don't know.
[03:02:50.687 --> 03:02:53.949]  You know, as any media organization does, sometimes we make mistakes.
[03:02:53.949 --> 03:02:54.929]  We try to correct them.
[03:02:54.929 --> 03:02:56.130]  I mean, those are the major faults.
[03:02:56.130 --> 03:02:58.051]  We are, we are gung-ho.
[03:02:58.051 --> 03:03:06.296]  We do get out there, get in people's faces, and, you know, sometimes we may need to be a bit more sophisticated about things, but... In the heat of the battle, we sometimes swing a little hard.
[03:03:06.296 --> 03:03:07.397]  Exactly.
[03:03:07.397 --> 03:03:08.377]  What about the enemies?
[03:03:08.377 --> 03:03:11.379]  You've experienced the traitors paying to lie about us.
[03:03:11.379 --> 03:03:13.500]  They think that it hurts us that they tell the lie.
[03:03:13.500 --> 03:03:14.541]  It hurts us that they're falling.
[03:03:14.541 --> 03:03:16.042]  But what would you say to the traitors?
[03:03:17.401 --> 03:03:22.885]  They must have convinced themselves that they've got this moral crusade to shut us down and that we're inherently evil.
[03:03:22.885 --> 03:03:26.608]  They must have convinced themselves of that in some way, at some level.
[03:03:26.608 --> 03:03:32.953]  The people at the top obviously know what this is all about and they stand on the wrong side of history.
[03:03:32.953 --> 03:03:38.497]  But the people on the lower levels, I think they've actually convinced themselves that we need to be toppled for the good of the world.
[03:03:39.266 --> 03:03:41.008]  We're a news organization, essentially.
[03:03:41.008 --> 03:03:45.273]  Like, how bad of an influence can we be having if they think they're in the moral right?
[03:03:45.273 --> 03:03:49.778]  And we're promoting freedom for families, free market, everything, exactly.
[03:03:49.778 --> 03:03:55.604]  But you're right, they get weak minds that say, oh, you're somebody special, you can challenge this, you can do this.
[03:03:55.604 --> 03:03:57.487]  And then they just make up fantastic lies.
[03:03:58.365 --> 03:04:13.579]  It's absolutely shocking, like, I'll Google my name on Google News every day to see the latest hit piece, and it's like, what was the song, you know, sounds like Satan but I'm not to them or something, there's a lyric, something, Neil Young lyric, something to that effect.
[03:04:14.509 --> 03:04:22.018]  Um, but yeah, I get up every day and look in the mirror, and that's not the person who I see being demonized on the internet, in the media.
[03:04:22.018 --> 03:04:28.906]  That's not the person- Well, that's the secret, is that you had dinner last night with former employees who were gonna do big, you know, New York Times hit pieces.
[03:04:28.906 --> 03:04:31.429]  Go to the comic book lie world.
[03:04:31.429 --> 03:04:32.530]  You think you have some power?
[03:04:33.371 --> 03:04:44.855]  In fact, I don't even probably sue you because you're a joke, you're a fraud, you're a nobody, and you're a miserable person whose wife will throw you out right after you're done doing this.
[03:04:44.855 --> 03:04:47.235]  You're nothing but toilet paper.
[03:04:47.235 --> 03:04:48.296]  I'm not your enemy.
[03:04:48.296 --> 03:04:51.577]  You're your enemy because you come from slaves.
[03:04:54.005 --> 03:04:59.430]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[03:04:59.430 --> 03:05:01.231]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[03:05:01.231 --> 03:05:02.993]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[03:05:02.993 --> 03:05:04.814]  Now, I can make them strong.
[03:05:04.814 --> 03:05:06.476]  Now, I can instruct them.
[03:05:06.476 --> 03:05:08.197]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[03:05:08.197 --> 03:05:09.178]  But not once I'm gone.
[03:05:09.298 --> 03:05:14.421]  You think of this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:05:14.421 --> 03:05:20.025]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:05:20.025 --> 03:05:23.648]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[03:05:23.648 --> 03:05:28.631]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[03:05:28.631 --> 03:05:35.536]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[03:05:35.536 --> 03:05:39.178]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[03:05:39.298 --> 03:05:46.885]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:05:46.885 --> 03:05:53.512]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:06:02.922 --> 03:06:13.129]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:13.129 --> 03:06:13.769]  Well, here we are.
[03:06:13.769 --> 03:06:15.330]  It's already Tuesday.
[03:06:15.330 --> 03:06:18.052]  It's amazing.
[03:06:18.052 --> 03:06:20.574]  Tuesday, March 5th, 2019.
[03:06:20.574 --> 03:06:25.437]  I am your host, Alex Jones, here in the new studio.
[03:06:25.437 --> 03:06:30.040]  You've seen us do a lot of live reports and had political coverage of big events.
[03:06:31.144 --> 03:06:39.911]  Like State of the Union, here in our new state-of-the-art studio, we've got three nice studios here now and are ready to start expanding to about 20 hours a day live.
[03:06:39.911 --> 03:06:49.580]  We're about six months behind getting that done because of all the obvious globalist attempts to shut us down and block us, but we are moving forward thanks to your prayers and thanks to your support.
[03:06:50.380 --> 03:06:59.326]  And quite frankly, we are now reaching just as many people as we ever did after all the enemy's attempts to shut us down and shut us up.
[03:06:59.326 --> 03:07:00.587]  It has backfired.
[03:07:00.587 --> 03:07:02.588]  We achieved Streisand effect.
[03:07:02.588 --> 03:07:09.753]  And now we're reaching an even wider new audience thanks to this core audience of activists taking action.
[03:07:10.652 --> 03:07:16.794]  And I thought I'd celebrate the new studio today by wearing a Stetson Open Road cowboy hat, silver belly.
[03:07:16.794 --> 03:07:21.955]  This is the same hat my dad's dad wore his whole life, and I knew him.
[03:07:21.955 --> 03:07:25.996]  And I got reminded of these, that Paul Watson's here in town.
[03:07:25.996 --> 03:07:31.137]  And about, it was like 15 years ago, that Paul has a whole different personality when you put a cowboy hat on him.
[03:07:32.314 --> 03:07:47.079]  And so we're going to put a cowboy hat on him and get his great Texas imitation, but also a lot of other serious issues when he joins us at the waypoint, at the midway point, halfway into the broadcast in about an hour and 23 minutes from now.
[03:07:47.079 --> 03:07:56.261]  Faith Goldie is also on fire, exposing the controlled globalists inside the Republican Party, one of the final obstacles to really defeating the NWO.
[03:07:56.261 --> 03:07:59.282]  She's going to be popping in, and I intend to open the phones up as well.
[03:07:59.282 --> 03:08:01.623]  And then I will co-host the War Room.
[03:08:02.944 --> 03:08:05.607]  With Owen Troyer, 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:08:05.607 --> 03:08:13.096]  today, I will be on the second half with Paul Joseph Watson, and we're going to have open phones, and on Reddit, Ask Us Anything.
[03:08:13.096 --> 03:08:17.541]  I'm going to start a new system of Ask Me Anything, where you do it with two people.
[03:08:17.541 --> 03:08:23.067]  Two different people, and you ask two different interesting people questions, and they have a discussion, and they ask each other questions.
[03:08:24.008 --> 03:08:24.969]  That's something I'm going to start.
[03:08:24.969 --> 03:08:31.712]  I'm going to start a podcast soon titled, Ask Me Anything, where you have different guests on and you can ask them anything as well.
[03:08:31.712 --> 03:08:35.434]  So a lot of stuff about to happen here at InfoWars.
[03:08:35.434 --> 03:08:36.374]  Thanks to your prayers.
[03:08:36.374 --> 03:08:37.455]  Thanks for your support.
[03:08:37.455 --> 03:08:38.535]  Thanks to everything you do.
[03:08:38.535 --> 03:08:43.178]  And thanks to all the great AM and FM affiliates and TV affiliates as well, if you're listening to one of those.
[03:08:43.178 --> 03:08:48.581]  Please be sure and spread the word about those fine stations and support them.
[03:08:48.581 --> 03:08:48.761]  OK.
[03:08:50.891 --> 03:08:54.256]  You know, I talked about this a couple years ago when they passed the law.
[03:08:54.256 --> 03:08:59.624]  And they always pass draconian laws where they come into effect in a few years.
[03:09:01.101 --> 03:09:04.243]  Show that the public doesn't oppose them.
[03:09:04.243 --> 03:09:05.784]  People are very short-sighted.
[03:09:05.784 --> 03:09:07.906]  They're thinking in the moment, not long-term.
[03:09:07.906 --> 03:09:10.908]  But exactly as we said they would do it, they've done it.
[03:09:10.908 --> 03:09:13.849]  And if you sit back and think, how would you take over the Internet?
[03:09:13.849 --> 03:09:16.311]  How would you trick people to openly be surveilled?
[03:09:16.311 --> 03:09:21.675]  How would you trick people to be taxed to use the Internet more than they even do in Communist China?
[03:09:22.435 --> 03:09:23.196]  How would you do that?
[03:09:23.196 --> 03:09:47.472]  Well, when you saw Pornhub and a couple of these other major sites that get billions of views a month together, at the heart of UN meetings and meetings with ICANN and meetings with Big Tech about how they were going to battle trafficking in humans and how they were going to empower women, you knew it was bad.
[03:09:47.472 --> 03:09:51.175]  So they signed on to ban free porn.
[03:09:52.276 --> 03:10:01.970]  Now their sites will still be a mix of paid and quote free, but of course if they've got more than half the porn market, they want to be able to shut everybody else down.
[03:10:02.870 --> 03:10:03.851]  It's not about porn, though.
[03:10:03.851 --> 03:10:07.374]  They know that it'll get conservatives and Christians on board.
[03:10:07.374 --> 03:10:13.079]  And just like the British government, it's the only government in the world that has a paid television tax.
[03:10:13.079 --> 03:10:17.523]  Even if you don't own a television, they tax you what is up to a thousand pounds a year.
[03:10:17.523 --> 03:10:19.685]  It's an outrageous amount of money.
[03:10:19.685 --> 03:10:24.310]  And they even have vans that drive around because any receiver also transmits
[03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:26.751]  A tiny transmission.
[03:10:26.751 --> 03:10:28.412]  Any receiver is also a transceiver.
[03:10:28.412 --> 03:10:34.154]  So they have vans that drive around with people picking up if you're watching television.
[03:10:34.154 --> 03:10:36.455]  Not just BBC, but television, period.
[03:10:36.455 --> 03:10:40.357]  So there's a government tax to then fund propaganda.
[03:10:41.204 --> 03:10:42.084]  And that's what this is.
[03:10:42.084 --> 03:10:44.045]  So people think of the UK as such a free country.
[03:10:44.045 --> 03:10:46.745]  It's an outrageously unfree country.
[03:10:46.745 --> 03:10:49.186]  And so I'm going to break that down today in great detail.
[03:10:49.186 --> 03:10:53.427]  I'll apologize for watching on from the UK in studio to give a systec on it.
[03:10:53.427 --> 03:10:58.828]  But you see the DrugsReport.com headline, the headlines on InfoWars.com as well.
[03:10:58.828 --> 03:11:04.749]  UK blocks all porn that's free or free porn blocked.
[03:11:04.749 --> 03:11:06.810]  Free porn blocked in the UK.
[03:11:06.810 --> 03:11:07.970]  You go to InfoWars.com
[03:11:09.250 --> 03:11:21.678]  And we have the headline that the national move in the UK to ban, quote, free porn is really an internet tax and internet tracking system.
[03:11:21.678 --> 03:11:24.319]  So this is it.
[03:11:24.319 --> 03:11:25.840]  This is the plan.
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:31.444]  And I told folks a couple of years ago when they were talking about it, that this is what's being implemented.
[03:11:31.444 --> 03:11:35.306]  But it's sold as just, oh, you pay the government.
[03:11:36.468 --> 03:11:43.493]  And then they put software on your computer that watches what you do, and you give them your ID, your passport, and now you can go look at any porn you want.
[03:11:43.493 --> 03:11:45.495]  So I'm going to say that again.
[03:11:45.495 --> 03:11:56.083]  The government is going to have a dossier, and they already do, but publicly, you're going to opt into a dossier that knows what porn you're watching.
[03:11:56.083 --> 03:12:03.048]  So you and your wife, it's Saturday night, you go in, you turn on the television, you dial into the internet, and you pull up whatever your wife's into.
[03:12:03.048 --> 03:12:04.489]  That's how it works.
[03:12:05.758 --> 03:12:09.701]  And now you've got another partner in the bedroom with you.
[03:12:09.701 --> 03:12:11.342]  It's called the British government.
[03:12:11.342 --> 03:12:13.203]  But understand, it's coming here.
[03:12:13.203 --> 03:12:14.584]  This is the model.
[03:12:14.584 --> 03:12:17.386]  Everything done in China and England and Europe is the model.
[03:12:36.238 --> 03:12:37.039]  But any claims?
[03:12:44.366 --> 03:12:50.070]  That the government of the UK or the US government or anybody trying to defend kids from porn is asinine.
[03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:52.372]  Because I've got stories right here in my stack.
[03:12:52.372 --> 03:12:54.833]  Aggressive promotion of homosexuality.
[03:12:54.833 --> 03:13:00.077]  School stops LGBT lesson after backlash from angry parents.
[03:13:00.077 --> 03:13:03.259]  It's being reported by the Daily Mail, by RT and others.
[03:13:03.259 --> 03:13:04.480]  And you learn it's Muslims.
[03:13:04.480 --> 03:13:08.163]  So say what you want about Muslims who throw gays off buildings and cut women's genitals off.
[03:13:09.083 --> 03:13:10.444]  I disagree with that.
[03:13:10.444 --> 03:13:11.805]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:13:11.805 --> 03:13:15.388]  But I don't think you should have LGBT sexualizing kids.
[03:13:15.388 --> 03:13:18.150]  That's the pedophile side of that.
[03:13:18.150 --> 03:13:20.171]  Some groups are officially adopting the P now.
[03:13:20.171 --> 03:13:21.752]  They're saying, yes, we are pedophilia.
[03:13:23.994 --> 03:13:26.155]  That was in the Congressional Report five years ago.
[03:13:26.155 --> 03:13:27.736]  The Democrats wanted all this.
[03:13:27.736 --> 03:13:28.916]  The same thing's happening in the UK.
[03:13:28.916 --> 03:13:30.677]  It's a unified, concerted effort.
[03:13:30.677 --> 03:13:32.578]  So they're sexualizing children.
[03:13:32.578 --> 03:13:34.899]  They've got drag kid things at school.
[03:13:34.899 --> 03:13:38.560]  They had drag queens coming and telling your five-year-old son that they're really a girl.
[03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:40.341]  I mean, if that happened at the park, you'd go to jail.
[03:13:40.341 --> 03:13:48.305]  If a man walked over at the park while you're sitting there grilling hamburgers and said, I'm going to teach your daughter and your son about sex, they'd be arrested as being a pervert.
[03:13:48.985 --> 03:13:51.066]  But now that it's done officially by the school, it's okay.
[03:13:51.066 --> 03:13:57.488]  So, meanwhile, just today, you've got massive arrests of giant Islamic grooming gangs of little girls.
[03:13:57.488 --> 03:14:02.029]  And then you've got the leftist ally with radical Islam saying, come on in, do whatever you want.
[03:14:02.029 --> 03:14:06.191]  But now the Muslims are saying, hey, I'm going to teach my five-year-old how to give a blowjob.
[03:14:06.191 --> 03:14:08.231]  It's what they teach in UK schools.
[03:14:08.231 --> 03:14:10.132]  Or that he's going to put a dress on him.
[03:14:11.331 --> 03:14:17.076]  And so now the left's saying, it's okay, Muslims can opt out, but no one else can, and you'll be arrested if you're not a Muslim.
[03:14:17.076 --> 03:14:19.779]  So see, this is how the whole leftist system works.
[03:14:19.779 --> 03:14:21.700]  Total and complete tyranny.
[03:14:21.700 --> 03:14:27.305]  So, when the UK, quote, blocks porn that is, quote, free, what they're saying is...
[03:14:28.206 --> 03:14:36.353]  The tens of thousands of other sites, or now they're even going to go Puritan on you, Puritanical, and say even showing breast.
[03:14:36.353 --> 03:14:38.535]  ShoffCorp is now regulated.
[03:14:38.535 --> 03:14:43.320]  So now if you want to watch an R-rated movie, you're going to have to opt into a government database and agree to be tracked.
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:46.322]  That's the secret of the global social credit score, to get you to opt in.
[03:14:47.338 --> 03:14:48.899]  It's outrageous.
[03:14:48.899 --> 03:15:02.124]  So all the other sites can be shut down, all the other sites can be blocked, and only the two big porn sites that account for half the porn visits in the world, well of course they're for this, PornHub and YouPorn.
[03:15:02.124 --> 03:15:13.369]  Now, now because this is much bigger than all the TV networks and all the media in the world combined, it's now going to be regulated and turned into one homogenized controlled combine.
[03:15:14.753 --> 03:15:16.354]  Which is what it's always been about.
[03:15:16.354 --> 03:15:17.795]  That's what internet regulation is about.
[03:15:17.795 --> 03:15:22.458]  The attacks on talk radio, the attacks on Alex Jones, the attacks on free speech.
[03:15:22.458 --> 03:15:24.999]  Because once they can ban me, they can ban you.
[03:15:24.999 --> 03:15:36.046]  And once they can say, oh, you have a government device and software, it watches what porn you're watching and you pay a government license to go watch pornography from around the world.
[03:15:37.146 --> 03:15:37.907]  Think about that.
[03:15:37.907 --> 03:15:48.738]  That is so diabolical and so evil, and it's the left doing it in the name of protecting children, when they're the ones that are a bunch of pedophilic perverts trying to get a hold of your kids and literally teach them how to be perverts!
[03:15:48.738 --> 03:15:49.398]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:49.398 --> 03:15:49.759]  Stay with us.
[03:15:53.291 --> 03:15:54.512]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.512 --> 03:15:58.415]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.415 --> 03:15:59.956]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:59.956 --> 03:16:02.918]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.918 --> 03:16:08.481]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.481 --> 03:16:09.682]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.682 --> 03:16:12.624]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.624 --> 03:16:14.846]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:16:22.851 --> 03:16:29.194]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.194 --> 03:16:32.235]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.235 --> 03:16:38.158]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.158 --> 03:16:41.960]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.960 --> 03:16:43.221]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.221 --> 03:16:44.561]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.561 --> 03:16:50.764]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.764 --> 03:16:52.205]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.875 --> 03:16:56.458]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:16:56.458 --> 03:17:00.021]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:17:00.021 --> 03:17:02.163]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:18:07.287 --> 03:18:08.428]  X2 is back.
[03:18:08.428 --> 03:18:09.208]  We got it.
[03:18:09.208 --> 03:18:10.889]  This deal just happened about a month ago.
[03:18:10.889 --> 03:18:12.490]  We rushed it into production.
[03:18:12.490 --> 03:18:13.251]  It's been bottled.
[03:18:13.251 --> 03:18:15.252]  The labels are being put on today.
[03:18:15.252 --> 03:18:19.015]  And then it's going to be on an 18-wheeler right here to Austin from the
[03:18:19.215 --> 03:18:19.395]  Yeah.

[03:19:57.077 --> 03:19:59.739]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.006 --> 03:20:19.929]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:20:19.929 --> 03:20:21.170]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:45.703 --> 03:20:47.244]  I didn't tell you I was going on Joe Rogan.
[03:20:47.244 --> 03:20:49.506]  We just snuck a tap.
[03:20:49.506 --> 03:20:54.510]  And I can tell you there's a bunch of other sneak attacks coming very soon just as big.
[03:20:54.510 --> 03:20:55.631]  Or bigger.
[03:20:55.631 --> 03:20:57.072]  Talked to Joe Sim this morning.
[03:20:57.072 --> 03:21:02.496]  It is undoubtedly, with analytics, the biggest podcast he's ever done.
[03:21:02.496 --> 03:21:04.278]  And the last one I did was number three.
[03:21:04.278 --> 03:21:06.239]  It was number one until Elon Musk and a few others.
[03:21:06.239 --> 03:21:10.422]  Now it's number one only six days in.
[03:21:11.423 --> 03:21:18.525]  In fact, we're expecting by tomorrow night, it will have at least 30 million views between YouTube and iTunes.
[03:21:18.525 --> 03:21:21.826]  Right now, it's over 20 million total.
[03:21:21.826 --> 03:21:24.606]  And that's with Google not letting it trend and blocking it.
[03:21:24.606 --> 03:21:25.166]  Remember that.
[03:21:25.166 --> 03:21:27.167]  Now, let me make the big announcement here.
[03:21:27.167 --> 03:21:29.708]  Okay?
[03:21:29.708 --> 03:21:39.550]  Internet ID... Let me make the big announcement here.
[03:21:41.058 --> 03:21:50.424]  Internet ID, Internet regulation, Internet tracking, is here.
[03:21:50.424 --> 03:21:56.568]  And it's being done under the auspice of, quote, blocking free porn.
[03:21:56.568 --> 03:22:07.655]  The UK has now passed law that has implemented, April 1st, that only the two big porn companies, Pornhub and YouPorn, will be the only sites you can visit.
[03:22:09.733 --> 03:22:22.498]  Everything else you've got to go through a government database, give them a passport or an ID, log into a government database so they can track what you do, and then pay them money so that you have the right to go look at pornography.
[03:22:22.498 --> 03:22:34.143]  So just like George Orwell predicted in 1984, the government is going to be in charge of pornography for control and debasement of the population.
[03:22:35.580 --> 03:22:38.001]  This has nothing to do with stopping pornography.
[03:22:38.001 --> 03:22:40.322]  It has nothing to do with stopping the targeting of children.
[03:22:40.322 --> 03:22:41.822]  It's mainstream media.
[03:22:41.822 --> 03:22:42.703]  It's cartoons.
[03:22:42.703 --> 03:22:44.143]  It's the public schools.
[03:22:44.143 --> 03:22:51.706]  It's all of them that are totally and completely obsessed with sexualizing children.
[03:22:51.706 --> 03:23:01.250]  And now that the government is going to be involved with all these fact-checking groups and leftist groups like Hope Not Hate and the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[03:23:02.893 --> 03:23:04.654]  And media matters.
[03:23:04.654 --> 03:23:09.898]  They're going to be in the history of the supposed porn you're visiting.
[03:23:09.898 --> 03:23:12.680]  And don't think this is just gonna end in the UK.
[03:23:12.680 --> 03:23:17.343]  They admit with the major porn companies who want their competition shut down.
[03:23:17.343 --> 03:23:18.664]  This is total racketeering.
[03:23:18.664 --> 03:23:21.766]  This is total antitrust.
[03:23:21.766 --> 03:23:24.949]  They admit that they want their competition shut down.
[03:23:24.949 --> 03:23:32.134]  So they're partnering with government to control and track who looks at porn webcams.
[03:23:33.223 --> 03:23:40.667]  What movies you watch, what you do, and even softcore pornography will now be tracked in a government database.
[03:23:40.667 --> 03:23:49.612]  Think about how the IRS abused tens of thousands of Christians and conservatives and libertarians under Obama and no one got in trouble with Loris Lerner.
[03:23:49.612 --> 03:24:01.338]  Think about all the incredible abuses they've been involved with with the databases and leftist doxing people and using where you live and where you go to school and where you work to get you fired if you're a Trump supporter.
[03:24:02.554 --> 03:24:14.897]  And then imagine, you've got to take your hat off to them to come up with something like this, that they would try to get away with this in 2019 and then just, oh, it's just a law to protect kids.
[03:24:14.897 --> 03:24:18.118]  You've got to pay a government fee.
[03:24:18.118 --> 03:24:19.619]  You've got to then be tracked.
[03:24:19.619 --> 03:24:24.500]  And then the government, of course, can easily go in anytime they want.
[03:24:24.500 --> 03:24:30.682]  And they can add whatever disinformation they want to the database of supposed porn that you visited.
[03:24:31.616 --> 03:24:38.984]  Because in blackmail and control, people's sexual proclivity, people's sexual activity are their big, dark secrets.
[03:24:38.984 --> 03:24:51.137]  And now the UK government, the kings of blackmail, the kings of pedophilia, the kings of using sex to control populations and governments, are now saying, oh, by the way, you visit any major porn site,
[03:24:53.374 --> 03:24:54.976]  You've got to have a government license.
[03:24:54.976 --> 03:24:56.177]  You've got to give us your ID.
[03:24:56.177 --> 03:24:57.538]  You've got to be in a database.
[03:24:57.538 --> 03:25:06.648]  You've got to have our software on your computer that will have trusted groups like Hope Not Hate and the Southern Poverty Law Center and others inside your computer.
[03:25:06.648 --> 03:25:09.390]  George Soros funded groups just like NewsGuard.
[03:25:10.291 --> 03:25:14.175]  It's now on all the Microsoft operating systems and browsers.
[03:25:14.175 --> 03:25:20.501]  And it's going to move on, they're saying, in the next few months to Apple, and to Google, and to Android, and to the phones.
[03:25:20.501 --> 03:25:32.452]  And then now, when you visit a site, it's not going to be on the site that, oh, don't listen to Alex Jones, here's some fact-checking, where they then misrepresent what we've said and done, and then fact-check the straw man.
[03:25:32.452 --> 03:25:34.894]  No, it's on your phone, it's on your desktop.
[03:25:35.134 --> 03:25:47.760]  They're in your phone, they're in your desktop, watching what you do in real time, telling you, oh, this is dangerous, or, oh, this is bad, or, oh, you could have your credit score lowered, you could get in trouble, you're looking at illegal content!
[03:25:47.760 --> 03:25:48.921]  So it's multi-pronged.
[03:25:48.921 --> 03:25:59.726]  They've got the leftist fact-checkers in the universities, and the intelligence agencies already plugged into Microsoft, and looking at what you're saying, and looking at what you're doing.
[03:25:59.726 --> 03:26:01.247]  And the neocons run NewsGarden.
[03:26:03.004 --> 03:26:11.069]  And then you've got over here the left going, oh, no one wants to pay their BBC fee anymore of a thousand pounds a year or whatever it is.
[03:26:11.069 --> 03:26:15.852]  Look up what the BBC yearly charge is.
[03:26:15.852 --> 03:26:17.353]  Look that up for me real quick.
[03:26:17.353 --> 03:26:25.377]  Look up the BBC yearly charge for me because I want to get that looked at right now.
[03:26:25.377 --> 03:26:26.038]  I want to do that.
[03:26:27.065 --> 03:26:34.299]  So imagine, they started this back in the 40s after World War II, and they said, everybody that has a television, you've got to pay a tax.
[03:26:34.299 --> 03:26:39.328]  And then even if you didn't have a television, they said, well you may be looking at your neighbor's TV, so you're going to pay this big giant tax.
[03:26:40.322 --> 03:26:46.606]  Now, it used to be up to a thousand pounds, but now no one would pay it, so they lowered it to 147 to 150 pounds.
[03:26:46.606 --> 03:26:47.547]  So what is that?
[03:26:47.547 --> 03:26:48.948]  Two hundred and something dollars a year.
[03:26:48.948 --> 03:26:51.689]  But again, the key here isn't the money.
[03:26:51.689 --> 03:26:52.550]  It's with the internet.
[03:26:52.550 --> 03:26:59.214]  They can track what you're looking at and what you're doing, and they think the subservient, pliant population will accept it.
[03:26:59.214 --> 03:27:00.635]  But here's where it gets worse.
[03:27:00.635 --> 03:27:04.097]  Now it turns loose the taxing authority.
[03:27:04.097 --> 03:27:07.840]  They have their IRS over there, by another name.
[03:27:09.821 --> 03:27:22.430]  But their inland revenue, inside the empire revenue, and now they're going to have an excuse to raid you to see that you were looking at porn that wasn't authorized and wasn't put through a government filter.
[03:27:22.430 --> 03:27:23.470]  I'm going to say it again.
[03:27:23.470 --> 03:27:29.395]  The government is going to run worldwide the production and the distribution, because that's how this works.
[03:27:29.395 --> 03:27:35.519]  Once you take control of the regulatory power of something, you will then inevitably become the producer, the director, you will be the person making the money.
[03:27:36.039 --> 03:27:44.122]  So governments are now always horning in on Hollywood and the theater and entertainment and having a merger of that in any fascist or communist system.
[03:27:44.122 --> 03:27:56.447]  But now they'll be directly in control of pornography and the top pornography producers are all lined up as shooters to government because the internet decentralized porn and took the money out of it.
[03:27:58.291 --> 03:28:10.236]  All the way now to the only way you make money in porn, if you read the expert analysis, is individual to individual like prostitution, where women and men are doing webcams and giving people personal attention.
[03:28:10.236 --> 03:28:25.183]  So it's evolved or devolved now back to closer to real sex, away from the big cookie cutter mass production of the 1960s and 1970s, where there were porn movies making as much money as major Hollywood movies, tens of millions of dollars.
[03:28:25.183 --> 03:28:26.884]  That's all decentralized and destroyed.
[03:28:27.404 --> 03:28:29.805]  So now you have the perfect storm.
[03:28:29.805 --> 03:28:46.053]  Now you have the perfect storm of the big porn companies collapsing, government wanting to know what you're watching and doing, global government, internet ID, global social score coming together, and England, the UK, is the launch point for total surveillance of everything, and it's coming here, make no mistake.
[03:28:46.053 --> 03:28:50.675]  When we return, Google just got caught lying about Dragonfly and mass spying!
[03:28:53.433 --> 03:28:55.395]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:55.395 --> 03:29:00.719]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:29:00.719 --> 03:29:02.301]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:02.301 --> 03:29:10.648]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:10.648 --> 03:29:16.333]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:16.513 --> 03:29:18.335]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:18.335 --> 03:29:20.597]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:20.597 --> 03:29:25.001]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:25.001 --> 03:29:27.203]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:27.203 --> 03:29:34.931]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:29:55.859 --> 03:29:58.940]  At its regular price, it's a little over $3.
[03:29:58.940 --> 03:30:03.802]  When we have it discounted, it's at about $2.50 a piece.
[03:30:03.802 --> 03:30:07.784]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[03:30:07.784 --> 03:30:09.185]  This is high-end.
[03:30:09.185 --> 03:30:12.466]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[03:30:12.466 --> 03:30:16.528]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[03:30:17.148 --> 03:30:26.033]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[03:30:26.033 --> 03:30:28.474]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:30:28.474 --> 03:30:28.875]  It's simple.
[03:30:28.875 --> 03:30:34.498]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalists.
[03:30:34.998 --> 03:30:37.359]  And the attempt that we're engaged in to take the country back.
[03:30:37.359 --> 03:30:38.279]  It's simple.
[03:30:38.279 --> 03:30:44.242]  Go shop with the good guys at Infowarsstore.com and break the back of the globalists and get high quality super discounts.
[03:30:44.242 --> 03:30:51.585]  Or keep shopping with Jeff Bezos and Amazon and keep going to Whole Foods that are actually funding the Washington Post and the globalists' attempt to destroy this country.
[03:30:51.585 --> 03:30:52.586]  It's that simple.
[03:30:52.586 --> 03:30:53.466]  Infowarslife.com
[03:30:54.046 --> 03:31:02.431]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:31:02.431 --> 03:31:03.892]  Believe me, I know.
[03:31:03.892 --> 03:31:08.194]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:08.194 --> 03:31:13.617]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[03:31:13.837 --> 03:31:33.998]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[03:31:34.478 --> 03:31:38.241]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[03:31:47.166 --> 03:31:49.888]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[03:31:49.888 --> 03:31:52.329]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:53.914 --> 03:31:59.097]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:31:59.097 --> 03:32:07.682]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:32:07.682 --> 03:32:10.643]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:32:10.643 --> 03:32:12.404]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:32:12.404 --> 03:32:18.668]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:32:20.769 --> 03:32:26.071]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[03:32:26.071 --> 03:32:29.032]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:32:29.032 --> 03:32:32.973]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:32:32.973 --> 03:32:36.934]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:32:36.934 --> 03:32:38.775]  I've got two in my home.
[03:32:38.775 --> 03:32:44.857]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:32:44.857 --> 03:32:45.697]  Don't live
[03:32:46.537 --> 03:32:50.241]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[03:32:50.241 --> 03:32:57.088]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:57.088 --> 03:32:59.691]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:06.904 --> 03:33:12.085]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called InfoWars.
[03:33:12.085 --> 03:33:27.689]  And in the decades since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates, tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[03:33:27.689 --> 03:33:35.611]  InfoWars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering breaking news, live coverage of special events,
[03:33:35.911 --> 03:33:39.732]  And exclusive reports you won't find anywhere else.
[03:33:39.732 --> 03:33:50.176]  While the old guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape rocked by innovation and technology, InfoWars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[03:33:50.176 --> 03:34:01.521]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views of our online content, InfoWars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[03:34:02.741 --> 03:34:11.884]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes.
[03:34:11.884 --> 03:34:13.544]  Demand truth.
[03:34:13.544 --> 03:34:16.985]  Demand InfoWars.
[03:34:16.985 --> 03:34:18.105]  InfoWars.
[03:34:18.105 --> 03:34:19.606]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:34:54.432 --> 03:35:06.734]  So in 2017, we have states passing laws to kill babies that are totally healthy and already outside the womb.
[03:35:06.734 --> 03:35:15.436]  In 2019, they're teaching five-year-olds and four-year-olds in the UK and Canada and the US that little boys are really little girls and little girls are really little boys.
[03:35:15.436 --> 03:35:20.957]  Serious psychological abuse beyond sexual abuse, trying to literally destroy their identity.
[03:35:22.017 --> 03:35:24.118]  Something that if parents did it, they should be arrested.
[03:35:24.118 --> 03:35:27.601]  But the school does it, it's okay.
[03:35:27.601 --> 03:35:40.129]  And now, UK porn block starts April 1st, but you can unlock it by handing over ID or buying a £5 porn card.
[03:35:40.129 --> 03:35:43.091]  So you pay like $7.
[03:35:43.091 --> 03:35:51.517]  And then the government tracks everything you do and has your ID and your name.
[03:35:53.579 --> 03:35:55.901]  And the government knows what you're watching and what you're doing.
[03:35:55.901 --> 03:35:56.922]  This is so creepy.
[03:35:56.922 --> 03:35:57.703]  This is so sick.
[03:35:57.703 --> 03:36:01.447]  The government is now a voyeur, a pimp in your bedroom.
[03:36:01.447 --> 03:36:04.770]  And of course it comes from the left.
[03:36:04.770 --> 03:36:08.013]  To protect the children, of course.
[03:36:08.013 --> 03:36:16.121]  Watching free porn in Britain is about to get a lot trickier thanks to new rules that aim to protect children from online smut.
[03:36:16.926 --> 03:36:18.647]  Yeah, we don't want kids to be hateful bigots.
[03:36:18.647 --> 03:36:20.128]  Let's teach them to be sexualized at age 5.
[03:36:20.128 --> 03:36:23.170]  They used to be called pedophilia, now it's called liberal.
[03:36:23.170 --> 03:36:30.956]  As early as next month, porn sites will be required to get proof of ID from UK residents before showing any X-rated clips.
[03:36:30.956 --> 03:36:36.520]  Includes free porn sites like Pornhub and YouPorn, who don't want there to be competition and want you to have to register.
[03:36:37.557 --> 03:36:44.351]  Which attract nearly 2 billion visits a month between them worldwide and know they're going to make 100 times more money with the government who they lobbied to do this.
[03:36:44.351 --> 03:36:47.617]  That's right, the big porn sites did this to create a monopoly.
[03:36:48.769 --> 03:36:58.213]  Those run a number of other sites and using Age ID system, which requires users to verify their age via an official form of ID, which is his driver's license or passport.
[03:36:58.213 --> 03:37:06.297]  So you're not getting into a hotel or passing a port, you're going to go watch whatever and now the government's going to be there with a record of it.
[03:37:06.297 --> 03:37:16.421]  From April, when the new system is expected to launch, Randy Internet lurkers will be shown a non-pornographic landing page, according to Age ID spokesman James Clark.
[03:37:18.271 --> 03:37:30.195]  When a user first visits a site protected by Age ID, a landing page will appear with a prompt for the user to verify their age before they can access the site, he told the Metro.
[03:37:30.195 --> 03:37:33.597]  Each website will create their own non-pornographic landing page.
[03:37:33.597 --> 03:37:42.480]  When someone first clicks the site, they'll be asked to register with Age ID to verify their age using a mobile SMZM's credit card or passport or driver's license.
[03:37:42.480 --> 03:37:45.821]  This is the Internet ID, Internet taxation, Internet regulation.
[03:37:46.676 --> 03:37:58.925]  Users will then be able to use the HID username or password attached to your driver's license, your passport, the government has, to access all porn sites that use HID, although some may use different verification systems.
[03:37:58.925 --> 03:38:04.649]  Clark said it's a one-time verification with a simple sign-in for future access.
[03:38:04.649 --> 03:38:12.955]  If a user verifies with a HID-protected site, they'll not need to perform the verification age or any other site carrying HID.
[03:38:12.955 --> 03:38:15.417]  And again, this is going to be used against everybody else to shut them down.
[03:38:16.704 --> 03:38:20.406]  This is the Global ID, folks, the Global Internet ID, the Holy Grail of Surveillance and Control.
[03:38:20.406 --> 03:38:24.907]  The new rules were approved as part of the Digital Economy Act two years ago.
[03:38:24.907 --> 03:38:28.349]  They aim to make it harder for under 18s to get a hold of adult material.
[03:38:28.349 --> 03:38:30.029]  No, that's going on in schools.
[03:38:30.029 --> 03:38:37.512]  As well as registering with Age ID, Brits will also be able to access porn sites using a voucher you can buy from high street shops.
[03:38:37.512 --> 03:38:38.573]  Isn't that nice?
[03:38:38.573 --> 03:38:43.355]  Thousands of shops will offer the special IDs which users can link to an app known as Portals.
[03:38:45.265 --> 03:38:49.219]  And then it goes on to say you can also buy a government ID and go to the government system.
[03:38:50.643 --> 03:38:53.064]  So there you go, and it's all tracked by the government.
[03:38:53.064 --> 03:38:54.385]  So they got you to opt in.
[03:38:54.385 --> 03:38:55.926]  Like, the government's not spying.
[03:38:55.926 --> 03:38:57.447]  Okay, they are, but you know what?
[03:38:57.447 --> 03:38:59.888]  We just need you to opt in so we can do it.
[03:38:59.888 --> 03:39:04.430]  Because it's illegal to spy on you, but now we're going to do it openly.
[03:39:04.430 --> 03:39:07.052]  And then meanwhile, I mentioned this article earlier.
[03:39:07.052 --> 03:39:16.177]  Aggressive promotion of homosexuality, called pedophilia when they target kids, school stops LGBT lessons after backlash from angry parents.
[03:39:16.177 --> 03:39:19.339]  And when you read the articles in RT or the Daily Mail,
[03:39:20.359 --> 03:39:21.761]  It's, oh, it's Muslims.
[03:39:21.761 --> 03:39:27.588]  They're upset that there's grown adults talking to their five-year-old sons and daughters about their sexual preference.
[03:39:27.588 --> 03:39:28.970]  Because kids aren't thinking about that.
[03:39:28.970 --> 03:39:31.293]  I mean, if a dad or mom started asking their five-year-old about...
[03:39:32.827 --> 03:39:35.228]  Have you heard about sadomasochism?
[03:39:35.228 --> 03:39:37.488]  Have you heard about sex changes in children?
[03:39:37.488 --> 03:39:39.349]  Have you heard about fisting?
[03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:40.589]  This is what they teach five-year-olds.
[03:39:40.589 --> 03:39:41.889]  The kids are like, what?
[03:39:41.889 --> 03:39:44.510]  And you're just totally screwing them up.
[03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:47.051]  I mean, it's irrevocable pedophilic assault.
[03:39:47.051 --> 03:39:51.112]  But it's all done by the leftist social engineers, so it's all A-OK.
[03:39:52.168 --> 03:39:52.928]  And it continues.
[03:39:52.928 --> 03:39:56.930]  School forced in LGBT lessons by outraged Muslim parents.
[03:39:56.930 --> 03:40:00.051]  So, yeah, the pedophiles are worse than even orthodox Islam.
[03:40:00.051 --> 03:40:02.792]  Even though there's a lot of pedophilia in Islam.
[03:40:02.792 --> 03:40:08.434]  A primary school in Birmingham, England has halted LGBT lessons for 600 victims.
[03:40:08.434 --> 03:40:09.795]  They call them pupils.
[03:40:09.795 --> 03:40:16.458]  Were reportedly taken out of class by furious Muslim parents upset at homosexuals being aggressively taught to their children.
[03:40:16.458 --> 03:40:16.978]  Homosexuality.
[03:40:17.907 --> 03:40:18.247]  I think?
[03:40:36.787 --> 03:40:47.234]  Feeling from angry parents was even boiled over into threats against the assistant head teacher, Andrew Moffitt, MBA, who is gay.
[03:40:47.234 --> 03:40:53.318]  He claims to have received nasty emails, including one which he said wouldn't last too long.
[03:40:54.813 --> 03:40:56.034]  It goes on from there.
[03:40:56.034 --> 03:41:01.616]  The primary school, which is around 720 victims, is located in the predominantly Muslim area.
[03:41:01.616 --> 03:41:10.360]  It has come under fire from Muslim parents for implementing the LGBT program, which seeks to challenge homophobia because homosexuality is strictly forbidden in Islam.
[03:41:10.860 --> 03:41:22.365]  According to Alum Rock Community Forum, children were removed from classes over the school's undermining of parental rights and aggressively promoting homosexuality, which is the total goal.
[03:41:22.365 --> 03:41:33.210]  The forum added that despite repeated petitions, protests, and dialogue integrated by parents, they have been arrogantly ignored because a pedophile can't control themselves.
[03:41:33.210 --> 03:41:38.653]  They will have their way with children until you lock them up or until they are executed.
[03:41:40.834 --> 03:41:42.836]  Remember when they used to be radical to say execute pedophiles?
[03:41:42.836 --> 03:41:45.018]  Now it's like, those are good people.
[03:41:45.018 --> 03:41:46.919]  Don't you try to do that.
[03:41:46.919 --> 03:41:48.341]  We can't allow that to go on.
[03:41:48.341 --> 03:41:54.947]  So, they're not trying to protect children in the pedophile-run, demonic command base of the United Kingdom.
[03:41:55.905 --> 03:42:03.512]  They are using what they've already done to then come in and try to get their mittens on everybody else's sexual activity or porn viewing.
[03:42:03.512 --> 03:42:04.353]  They already have it.
[03:42:04.353 --> 03:42:06.135]  They want to use it.
[03:42:06.135 --> 03:42:14.442]  They just want to legitimize that you opted into this and then demonize anybody else that doesn't sign up with the government to tell them where they went and what they did.
[03:42:14.442 --> 03:42:18.586]  They're training you to opt into your own slavery.
[03:42:18.586 --> 03:42:20.548]  Now, I think I've spent enough time on that, haven't I?
[03:42:23.038 --> 03:42:28.464]  So when we come back, Fountain of Youth, scientists switch off gene to double lifespan.
[03:42:28.464 --> 03:42:29.205]  Also, U.S.
[03:42:29.205 --> 03:42:33.550]  deaths from alcohol, drugs, and suicide at the highest levels ever recorded.
[03:42:33.550 --> 03:42:36.673]  And we're gonna get into the big news, AOC!
[03:42:36.673 --> 03:42:40.357]  Vanessa Susan went to prison for $27,000, they said was illegal.
[03:42:40.357 --> 03:42:42.159]  He gave to a friend running for the Senate.
[03:42:42.159 --> 03:42:44.362]  But in the very same state and very same district,
[03:42:45.712 --> 03:42:50.518]  They're saying AOC raised 18 million, most of it illegal, can keep the millions!
[03:42:50.518 --> 03:42:52.440]  That's right, she's above the law!
[03:42:52.440 --> 03:42:53.701]  She's a good, dirty commie!
[03:42:55.567 --> 03:42:56.928]  X2's back.
[03:42:56.928 --> 03:42:58.690]  The original X2.
[03:42:58.690 --> 03:42:59.651]  Deep Earth Crystal.
[03:42:59.651 --> 03:43:01.593]  Pure atomic iodine.
[03:43:01.593 --> 03:43:02.694]  What you want.
[03:43:02.694 --> 03:43:03.815]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:03.815 --> 03:43:05.236]  It'll be here in a week.
[03:43:05.236 --> 03:43:06.798]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[03:43:06.798 --> 03:43:07.759]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:43:07.759 --> 03:43:09.580]  With the best iodine in the world.
[03:43:09.580 --> 03:43:10.722]  X2, it's available.
[03:43:10.722 --> 03:43:11.702]  I thought X3's great.
[03:43:11.702 --> 03:43:13.905]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[03:43:13.905 --> 03:43:15.726]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[03:43:15.726 --> 03:43:17.068]  The scientists that do that.
[03:43:17.068 --> 03:43:18.889]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[03:43:19.710 --> 03:43:24.072]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[03:43:24.072 --> 03:43:28.173]  We now have X2 again and in FullWorthStore.com, so hallelujah!
[03:43:28.173 --> 03:43:39.878]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[03:43:39.878 --> 03:43:48.461]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,

[03:46:12.039 --> 03:46:22.124]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[03:46:40.992 --> 03:46:42.513]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:46:42.513 --> 03:46:43.993]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:46:43.993 --> 03:46:50.676]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:46:50.676 --> 03:46:57.059]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[03:46:57.059 --> 03:46:59.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:11.756 --> 03:47:36.889]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:36.889 --> 03:47:40.371]  Well, I'm gonna say it right now on air.
[03:47:43.135 --> 03:48:08.163]  I take my hat off to the Islamic Muslim community of the UK because they're the only groups consistently protesting and saying no to children as young as three years of age being taught that they are sexually active, that boys are girls, that girls are boys, and they've been protesting and saying no to the pedophile cult that runs the UK.
[03:48:08.163 --> 03:48:09.083]  And so I salute
[03:48:11.974 --> 03:48:16.253]  The Muslims in the UK for being better people than the average British citizen.
[03:48:17.293 --> 03:48:20.555]  And better than the police, and better than the government that's run by pedophiles.
[03:48:20.555 --> 03:48:31.723]  Because as bad as radical Islam is, and as bad as the horrible things you do are, and your grooming gangs, and all the rest of it, you're at least saying, let's just kidnap 13-year-old girls and turn them into sex slaves, which is terrible.
[03:48:31.723 --> 03:48:36.026]  But you're not saying, let's teach 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds the same stuff.
[03:48:36.026 --> 03:48:43.592]  So, in the whole spectrum of evil in the UK, I have to say, radical Islam and the Muslims are now better.
[03:48:44.619 --> 03:48:59.421]  And we just covered that in the last segment, how they are radically brainwashing children, how they're telling boys they're really girls, girls are really boys, they're sexualizing them, they're abusing them, it's pedophilia, and the Muslims have come out and said it's wrong, and are the people standing up.
[03:49:00.649 --> 03:49:07.433]  And I know there's been the Golden Age of Islam, and I know there's been Islamic countries and nations that were actually open and free during different parts of civilization.
[03:49:07.433 --> 03:49:12.056]  But the current one run by the Al-Qaeda, Wahhabi, and Saudi Arabia is pure evil.
[03:49:12.056 --> 03:49:19.600]  But I would welcome Islam to reform itself and then team up with the West to try to stand up against satanic activity.
[03:49:19.600 --> 03:49:29.366]  But right now the Left is in love with Islam because they think you're against Christianity, so they've made a deal with you, but now the Left doesn't know what to do because Islam is standing in the way
[03:49:30.495 --> 03:49:34.056]  On the left, perverting five-year-old children.
[03:49:34.056 --> 03:49:38.556]  So this is quite a conundrum, quite a paradox that we're going to be discussing.
[03:49:38.556 --> 03:49:51.419]  But I take my hat off to the Muslims of the UK, out of a giant, rotting, filthy, capitulated, passed out, submissive, demonic, drunken island.
[03:49:51.419 --> 03:49:54.899]  Of all the rotten parts of the fish, I guess you're the least rotten.
[03:49:54.899 --> 03:49:58.520]  I have to say it, maybe the UK will be liberated by Islam.
[03:49:59.548 --> 03:50:06.630]  I mean, they still have a lot of child kidnapping and a lot of sex slaves, but, you know, they kind of stop at 12-year-olds.
[03:50:06.630 --> 03:50:10.671]  And so, maybe we're being liberated by Islam, actually.
[03:50:10.671 --> 03:50:15.072]  Because the left is even worse than radical Islam, and I'll just go ahead and say it.
[03:50:15.072 --> 03:50:17.272]  And I've kind of been having this epiphany.
[03:50:17.272 --> 03:50:21.373]  Because the Christians won't say a damn thing in the UK.
[03:50:21.373 --> 03:50:26.354]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[03:50:26.354 --> 03:50:28.935]  The next thing I'm going to get to is so big.
[03:50:30.882 --> 03:50:36.267]  That I really don't want to just put it out there and not give it the attention it deserves, but I'm going to do it.
[03:50:36.267 --> 03:50:39.930]  Because my brain thinks a little bit different than a lot of people's.
[03:50:39.930 --> 03:50:51.180]  And I always kind of have a memory and I think about how it connects to things and how it ties into other events that have unfolded.
[03:50:51.180 --> 03:50:56.745]  And so, yeah, everybody's really excited right now that AOC, the meth mouth,
[03:50:57.878 --> 03:51:01.341]  The creature from the methamphetamine lagoon.
[03:51:01.341 --> 03:51:05.024]  Everyone is just so excited that she, she didn't steal a million.
[03:51:05.024 --> 03:51:06.766]  She didn't steal two million.
[03:51:06.766 --> 03:51:14.893]  I went in this morning when I saw it into the SEC records and the Federal Election Commission records.
[03:51:14.893 --> 03:51:16.514]  And that's why she ended up running.
[03:51:16.514 --> 03:51:18.997]  She was a front person for Soros money.
[03:51:20.083 --> 03:51:22.684]  And didn't just get 18 million, we found other packs.
[03:51:22.684 --> 03:51:24.905]  You'll hear about those in the next few days.
[03:51:24.905 --> 03:51:28.687]  Of course her and her business manager pocketed millions.
[03:51:28.687 --> 03:51:31.528]  Totally illegal!
[03:51:31.528 --> 03:51:33.609]  But when you're a Democrat, you're allowed to do it.
[03:51:33.609 --> 03:51:37.231]  So, the rest of the story here in just a moment.
[03:51:37.231 --> 03:51:46.395]  That said, we have some big specials that are going to be ending this week.
[03:51:46.395 --> 03:51:48.316]  That are some of the biggest specials we've ever had.
[03:51:50.032 --> 03:51:55.763]  And are products that, if you're a man particularly, you're insane if you're not taking.
[03:51:57.020 --> 03:52:11.363]  I set out with top developers, this product's been out about two years, took about a year to get it done, and I said, I see all these testosterone boosters and all these other libido boosters, and I know that the industry marks things up seven times on average.
[03:52:11.363 --> 03:52:16.444]  I just want to mark it up 150%, and I want to take most of the money and put it into the product.
[03:52:16.444 --> 03:52:18.725]  Instead of having $2 a product, I wanted to have $10, $15 a product in it.
[03:52:20.345 --> 03:52:22.286]  And companies go, no one's ever done that.
[03:52:22.286 --> 03:52:23.467]  No one does that.
[03:52:23.467 --> 03:52:27.169]  Usually the container, the bottle, is more cost than what's in it.
[03:52:27.169 --> 03:52:32.473]  And herbs and stuff that God gave us are so incredible, it still blows people away.
[03:52:32.473 --> 03:52:40.018]  And that's where all the modern drugs and all that stuff comes from, is copying what's in plants, what's in herbs, what's in minerals, what's in compounds.
[03:52:40.018 --> 03:52:49.324]  So I set out, with this product, Alpha Power, to produce something that is the strongest
[03:52:50.751 --> 03:52:58.576]  Libido, stamina, energy, sports, natural healthy enhancer that you can get.
[03:52:58.576 --> 03:53:01.438]  You can pay $100 for something that isn't as good.
[03:53:01.438 --> 03:53:03.800]  And it's usually a great deal at $69.
[03:53:03.800 --> 03:53:08.823]  It's $34.95 right now.
[03:53:08.823 --> 03:53:10.424]  It's 50% off.
[03:53:10.424 --> 03:53:18.550]  And we've got a combo deal going where you can get it, the strength and recovery combo, you can get it with BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:53:19.332 --> 03:53:25.038]  And again, the average turmeric formula, which is so hard to isolate and so powerful, is 3 to 5%.
[03:53:25.038 --> 03:53:26.920]  They know you're getting a result with that.
[03:53:26.920 --> 03:53:29.682]  I said, is it safe to give them the strongest available?
[03:53:29.682 --> 03:53:31.524]  And they said, well, no one's done it.
[03:53:31.524 --> 03:53:34.047]  Maybe other top brands are 80%.
[03:53:34.047 --> 03:53:35.969]  They said, no one else does that.
[03:53:35.969 --> 03:53:37.610]  A couple of brands do 80%.
[03:53:37.610 --> 03:53:39.392]  They said, our chemists can give you 95%.
[03:53:39.392 --> 03:53:42.175]  This is tested curcuminoid.
[03:53:43.969 --> 03:53:46.210]  And I said, I want 95% curcuminoid.
[03:53:46.210 --> 03:53:55.332]  So our turmeric is fresh and organic and there's an extraction patented process we gotta pay a lot of money for where it's 95% curcuminoid.
[03:53:55.332 --> 03:53:57.833]  If you don't know what that means, it's insane.
[03:53:57.833 --> 03:54:02.714]  I personally, if I take a leave, I get incredible heartburn and I feel horrible.
[03:54:02.714 --> 03:54:04.334]  Advil works really great for me.
[03:54:04.334 --> 03:54:07.215]  It's a great product.
[03:54:07.215 --> 03:54:08.455]  And I'm not comparing it to a drug.
[03:54:08.455 --> 03:54:10.516]  I'm just telling you personally, I don't take that now.
[03:54:11.764 --> 03:54:17.648]  I take a couple of bodies when I sprain an ankle or something happens, and it's way better for me personally.
[03:54:17.648 --> 03:54:21.950]  Just experience it for yourself what Mother Nature gave us.
[03:54:21.950 --> 03:54:22.550]  Curcuminoid.
[03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:27.653]  Everybody knows it is curry, but the chemical in curry is curcuminoid.
[03:54:27.653 --> 03:54:34.798]  Everybody knows how good, there's a little sprinkle of curry on that Indian food or that Chinese food, it's like, mmm, so good.
[03:54:34.798 --> 03:54:40.121]  But like hot food, this is concentrated hundreds and hundreds of times what you're gonna get in that meal.
[03:54:41.513 --> 03:54:43.654]  It isn't just curry.
[03:54:43.654 --> 03:54:46.235]  It's concentrated curry.
[03:54:46.235 --> 03:54:58.439]  The actual essence organically transferred and the great Indian analyst, the great Indian apothecaries will tell you that turmeric's the top thing.
[03:54:58.439 --> 03:55:06.963]  You take it with the different compounds we've got in the pill that are natural as well, they accelerate it and they get it into your body, into your cells.
[03:55:06.963 --> 03:55:07.683]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:55:08.959 --> 03:55:13.164]  Show, the InfoWars Life Strength and Recovery Combo is 50% off.
[03:55:13.164 --> 03:55:24.098]  Alpha Power and Bodies right now and you fund the InfoWars a total and complete, gigantic, insane, fire-breathing win-win-win-win-win up one side and down the other.
[03:55:25.774 --> 03:55:28.375]  So, take advantage of it today.
[03:55:28.375 --> 03:55:29.855]  X2 will be back in about a week.
[03:55:29.855 --> 03:55:30.636]  It's produced.
[03:55:30.636 --> 03:55:32.076]  We got them to do a better deal.
[03:55:32.076 --> 03:55:34.937]  The Deep Earth Crystal Iodine that was so popular, I thought it was gone.
[03:55:34.937 --> 03:55:36.117]  It's been sold out in 3-4 months.
[03:55:36.117 --> 03:55:37.318]  It's back.
[03:55:37.318 --> 03:55:39.058]  You can pre-order at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:55:39.058 --> 03:55:41.859]  Look at those 6,000 plus reviews.
[03:55:41.859 --> 03:55:43.740]  4.9, 98% review.
[03:55:43.740 --> 03:55:45.720]  The original, exact same.
[03:55:45.720 --> 03:55:47.041]  Survival Shield X2.
[03:55:47.041 --> 03:55:48.621]  We got the deal.
[03:55:48.621 --> 03:55:52.523]  I played guts ball, art of the deal, and we got it for you.
[03:55:52.523 --> 03:55:53.343]  And that's why it's
[03:55:55.556 --> 03:55:58.478]  37% off pre-ordered, out of the gates, and a discount.
[03:55:58.478 --> 03:56:00.059]  Passing those discounts on to you.
[03:56:00.059 --> 03:56:03.561]  Now, let me stop right there.
[03:56:03.561 --> 03:56:12.127]  I did not get to the AOC thing, and I did not spend time on all the other big stories that I've got here.
[03:56:12.127 --> 03:56:14.169]  I did not do that.
[03:56:14.169 --> 03:56:19.072]  And I've got Faith Goldie popping in, and I've got Paul Watson in the studio, but let me tell you something.
[03:56:19.072 --> 03:56:21.714]  I'm not a vindictive person, and
[03:56:23.447 --> 03:56:32.274]  I don't even like going to the zoo because you see those poor caged tigers and things that should be running around in the jungle.
[03:56:32.274 --> 03:56:37.998]  And I don't wish harm on her, but she wishes harm on us, and she's trying to take over our lives and trying to run things.
[03:56:37.998 --> 03:56:52.570]  But Dinesh D'Souza, who's a friend of mine and who is one of the top documentary filmmakers in history, got some of his friends to give twenty-something thousand dollars to his college best friend who was running for Senate against Hillary Clinton a decade ago.
[03:56:54.045 --> 03:57:00.566]  And then once he got a divorce, the liberals got his bank records, and they found out that he didn't know it was illegal.
[03:57:00.566 --> 03:57:08.188]  He could have just set up a PAC and done it, but he got them to get $23,000, I've got the articles here, to the Senate candidate.
[03:57:08.188 --> 03:57:10.928]  Now, Hillary's gotten billions at her illegal foundation.
[03:57:10.928 --> 03:57:13.109]  She didn't get in trouble.
[03:57:13.109 --> 03:57:20.690]  And now AOC raised $18 million at one PAC that she never identified as hers and kept millions.
[03:57:20.690 --> 03:57:22.871]  And now she's in a lot of trouble.
[03:57:22.871 --> 03:57:23.751]  So I'm going to say this right now.
[03:57:25.191 --> 03:57:27.152]  AOC needs to be under the prison.
[03:57:27.152 --> 03:57:28.453]  But they're going to try to spin this.
[03:57:28.453 --> 03:57:33.615]  But if we get the story out accurately, we could send AOC to prison.
[03:57:33.615 --> 03:57:37.276]  And by the way, the planets have aligned here.
[03:57:37.276 --> 03:57:39.077]  The planets have aligned.
[03:57:39.077 --> 03:57:41.918]  The Democrats want to flush this turd.
[03:57:41.918 --> 03:57:43.619]  And I want to help them.
[03:57:43.619 --> 03:57:46.680]  We'll be right back.
[03:57:46.680 --> 03:57:49.302]  Boxing championship fights.
[03:57:49.302 --> 03:57:54.084]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[03:57:55.200 --> 03:57:56.802]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[03:57:56.802 --> 03:57:57.302]  We stopped her.
[03:57:57.302 --> 03:57:59.504]  We got a nationalist in.
[03:57:59.504 --> 03:58:01.687]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[03:58:01.687 --> 03:58:03.448]  We are winning.
[03:58:03.448 --> 03:58:08.974]  But those of us who are at the very front line, the tip of the spear, are under unprecedented attack.
[03:58:08.974 --> 03:58:14.059]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[03:58:14.059 --> 03:58:15.180]  This is about who wants it most.
[03:58:16.627 --> 03:58:20.170]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors they've taken everything.
[03:58:20.170 --> 03:58:22.292]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
