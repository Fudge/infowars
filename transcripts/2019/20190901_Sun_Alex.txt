[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:02.011]  Thanks for watching!
[00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:15.064]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:15.064 --> 00:00:16.765]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:18.425]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:23.726]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:26.287]  And we're launching the show now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:26.287 --> 00:00:33.008]  Never fear, we're live on this September 1st, 2019 global transmission.
[00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:35.309]  We're going to cover the waterfront right now.
[00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:39.692]  This is Paul Johnson with Summit.News and Action 7 News.
[00:00:39.692 --> 00:00:40.774]  We're here in Hong Kong.
[00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.277]  This is Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:47.281]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Rees for the next week.
[00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:50.105]  This is Greg Rees for InfoWars.com in Hong Kong.
[00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:54.029]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement for InfoWars.com.
[00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:03.011]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:19.534]  We have Dan Lyman covering InfoWars Europe, Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American heartland, and from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:23.115]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.
[00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:24.676]  We have to keep winning!
[00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:26.118]  We have to win more!
[00:01:26.118 --> 00:01:28.501]  Go to InfoWarStore.com.
[00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:36.630]  You have gone to InfoWarStore.com and gotten books and films, supplements, t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need!
[00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.652]  Let me tell you, we're having some fun tonight.
[00:01:47.652 --> 00:01:51.095]  We are kicking September off just right.
[00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:52.337]  It's September 1st, 2019.
[00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:55.780]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.007]  And normally we kick the show off live on Sundays or on Mondays or Wednesdays or Thursdays or Fridays.
[00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:02.527]  Today,
[00:02:04.112 --> 00:02:27.823]  I chalk it up to gremlins because last week the big fancy expensive audio board just broke right before the show just burned out and died and then today it was the big video switcher died in the other studio and then folks had been playing tiddlywinks in this studio on Friday and didn't put any of it back so it took us 30 minutes to get up and running but that's okay because guess what happened I'm coming in tomorrow now
[00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:34.118]  In fact, I'm doing all four juicy hours live.
[00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:37.259]  And then, I'm doing The War Room.
[00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:38.619]  That's right.
[00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:43.500]  I'm gonna do seven hours of live shows tomorrow.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.222]  Because we're hitting the quickening right now, and it's gotta be done, and I gotta lead by example.
[00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:50.082]  So I'm gonna be here.
[00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:54.784]  In fact, I'm gonna broadcast next Sunday for 10 hours, probably.
[00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:57.764]  Because that's what's going to happen.
[00:02:57.764 --> 00:03:00.726]  We're going to intensify our attacks on the globalists.
[00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:01.647]  And we're not going to stop.
[00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:03.868]  We're not going to back down ever.
[00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:08.331]  Well, I did about, oh, five hours of preparation yesterday.
[00:03:08.331 --> 00:03:11.994]  And I did about five hours of preparation today at home.
[00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:17.674]  And I've got this whole incredibly important transmission lined up for you.
[00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:26.600]  And I respect the listeners and I respect the viewers very, very deeply for jumping through all the hoops over the years to keep us on air and to tune in.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:35.686]  And I really appreciate all of our AM and FM affiliates, our TV affiliates, and WWCR, the Global Shortwave, and the satellite folks that put us out, and everybody in this crew.
[00:03:35.686 --> 00:03:40.169]  And we've been going through growing pains as we've used my show for training.
[00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:46.621]  And so we are training on my show to launch some new shows that will be announced in just the next week and a half or so.
[00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:49.884]  So a lot of exciting things going on here.
[00:03:49.884 --> 00:03:52.307]  And there's no teleprompters here.
[00:03:52.307 --> 00:03:54.589]  I'm not a robot, you know, being told what to say and do.
[00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.631]  This is a real system.
[00:03:56.631 --> 00:03:58.934]  This is a real organic resistance out of Texas.
[00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:02.357]  We're not in fancy Los Angeles or fancy pants New York City.
[00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:05.432]  We're just right here in Texas.
[00:04:05.432 --> 00:04:10.696]  You know, I was down here in Austin before it became the Fancy Pants headquarters of this area.
[00:04:10.696 --> 00:04:12.957]  And, you know, if I had my druthers, I would leave it.
[00:04:12.957 --> 00:04:15.479]  But the full investment's here.
[00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.460]  The crew is here.
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.242]  And we've been invaded by the dregs of the people that made California fall apart.
[00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:21.303]  They're not really Californians.
[00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:29.368]  They're the offspring of the carpetbaggers and people that moved to California and sucked that state dry and now have moved on to conquer Texas.
[00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:32.791]  And we're only four to eight years away from being a blue state.
[00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:39.138]  So most folks I know are already evacuating Montana and Utah and Idaho, but that's not going to work.
[00:04:39.138 --> 00:04:43.404]  The left, once we build something there, will just come there and feed on us.
[00:04:43.404 --> 00:04:46.287]  But you know, our biggest enemy is not the satanic left.
[00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:48.150]  Our biggest enemy is ourselves.
[00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.135]  And the fact that the average person, all the studies show, is in a dream state.
[00:04:54.025 --> 00:04:57.386]  And the average person has an IQ less than a goldfish.
[00:04:57.386 --> 00:05:04.749]  And a goldfish is an IQ, not an IQ, attention span, but maybe lower than IQ as well in some cases.
[00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:10.491]  And so the average person has a shorter attention span than a goldfish.
[00:05:10.491 --> 00:05:18.234]  And this is the giant curse everywhere, programmed by the television, programmed by 70 years of TV.
[00:05:18.234 --> 00:05:21.335]  And so the average person may be intelligent,
[00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:29.015]  But they do not have an attention span, unless it's a video game they're playing, or, you know, maybe a football game they're watching.
[00:05:29.015 --> 00:05:39.424]  They're trained to give their attention span to something that manipulates their dopamine and gives them continually changing inputs.
[00:05:39.424 --> 00:05:47.570]  And so the globalists sit back while the general public has been put into this mind control trance, and they rule over us.
[00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.993]  And it's truly, truly disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:55.936]  We're going to break out of it, and we're going to conquer it, and we're going to deal with it.
[00:05:55.936 --> 00:05:58.719]  But as I said, I will be live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:02.583]  Central Standard Time, Lord willing, unless my car blows up or something.
[00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:04.565]  I mean, you know, who knows?
[00:06:04.565 --> 00:06:10.531]  But I will be here, hook or crook, covering it all and doing it all, because that's what has to happen.
[00:06:11.252 --> 00:06:24.561]  Because while the average American is just seeking after pleasure and seeking after diversions, the globalists are working around the clock to take everything you've got and create a post-human, post-industrial world.
[00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:27.343]  And I, for one, am not going to sit back and watch that happen.
[00:06:27.343 --> 00:06:32.567]  So, here, let's just begin to tell you about what's coming up next segment.
[00:06:33.576 --> 00:06:35.038]  Obviously.
[00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:44.609]  We're starting the show a little late today, but we're going to get into the gunman in West Texas shooting identified as Seth Ator.
[00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:51.277]  And this individual got pulled over by the police and then went crazy and began just indiscriminately shooting.
[00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:55.729]  That's normally what you see with a Mexican drug cartel.
[00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:57.230]  That's what they do when the cops pull them over.
[00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.873]  They start shooting at the cops, shooting everybody else, so everybody runs for cover.
[00:07:00.873 --> 00:07:02.214]  I don't know if this is connected to that.
[00:07:02.214 --> 00:07:03.535]  Who knows?
[00:07:03.535 --> 00:07:09.559]  But what I do know is, is that you have 12,000 people a year that die from guns in the United States.
[00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:16.805]  And what I do know is that around 9,000 of those are suicides.
[00:07:16.805 --> 00:07:17.886]  So we've got
[00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:33.471]  Quite a few people that are being killed in drive-by shootings, are being killed by murderers, but still statistically, ladies and gentlemen, tens of thousands drowned, tens of thousands fall and hit their head in the bathroom and die.
[00:07:33.471 --> 00:07:41.016]  And I pulled up the numbers here, they're always four or five years behind on statistics, but in 2016, 50 plus thousand people died from prescription
[00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:52.060]  Now, they've been reporting that it's 10 times worse now than it was a decade ago, but we don't have the exact numbers.
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:57.367]  So, let's just say hundreds of thousands of people are dying a year from drug overdoses.
[00:07:57.367 --> 00:07:59.771]  That famous baseball player just died from fentanyl.
[00:08:00.697 --> 00:08:03.518]  But you see, Trump's trying to make that a big front and center issue.
[00:08:03.518 --> 00:08:05.239]  I've tried to make it a big issue too.
[00:08:05.239 --> 00:08:09.681]  Most people have friends or family that are crippled by opiates.
[00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:12.083]  They've been causing problems for thousands of years.
[00:08:12.083 --> 00:08:15.444]  There's an old number, 2017, says 47,600.
[00:08:15.444 --> 00:08:18.586]  I actually have the federal government's own numbers here.
[00:08:18.586 --> 00:08:23.708]  I had to move my articles over from the other side and they got mixed together.
[00:08:23.708 --> 00:08:26.310]  So I'm going to get to this later in the next hour, but will someone
[00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.816]  Go and reprint, because I'm not going to dig through these stacks.
[00:08:31.816 --> 00:08:32.677]  No, can't do it now.
[00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:33.898]  I had them all stacked up.
[00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:35.880]  It's okay, they got moved over and mixed.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.382]  Or it's my fault, I mixed them wrong.
[00:08:37.382 --> 00:08:40.426]  The point is, is that I have the federal number that's 53,000.
[00:08:40.426 --> 00:08:42.047]  That graph we showed says 47,000 in 2016.
[00:08:42.047 --> 00:08:42.468]  No, no, no, it's 53,000.
[00:08:48.134 --> 00:08:53.457]  So, we're going to show you that as well, okay?
[00:08:53.457 --> 00:09:02.582]  And we're going to just basically look at the facts here that automobiles kill hundreds of thousands of people a year.
[00:09:02.582 --> 00:09:12.027]  But again, they hype up mass shootings because it is scary to think you can go to the movie theater or go to the shopping mall and then some crazy person comes in and kills you, but out of 300
[00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:19.462]  And probably 60 million people if you count all the illegal aliens, but 330 million people in the census.
[00:09:19.462 --> 00:09:23.803]  It's very rare to get shot in a mass shooting.
[00:09:23.803 --> 00:09:28.885]  Just like it's rare to have somebody break in your house and shoot you, but it's still terrible if it happens to you.
[00:09:28.885 --> 00:09:33.626]  But the point is the media is hyping this to launch red flag laws and try to take
[00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.471]  All of our guns.
[00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:39.333]  So that then they can really have some fun with us.
[00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:43.435]  We'll be back with all the latest and back to O'Rourke saying confiscate all the guns.
[00:09:43.435 --> 00:09:44.416]  Straight ahead, please stay with us.
[00:09:49.796 --> 00:09:54.999]  It's been a year since InfoWars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[00:09:54.999 --> 00:10:02.903]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned, and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[00:10:02.903 --> 00:10:10.887]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.
[00:10:10.887 --> 00:10:11.927]  And it's now here.
[00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:13.088]  Banned.Video.
[00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:28.263]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.

[00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:51.161]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:52.322]  Alex, God bless you.
[00:11:52.322 --> 00:11:54.905]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:11:54.905 --> 00:12:00.891]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[00:12:00.891 --> 00:12:01.552]  Ooh, yeah.
[00:12:01.552 --> 00:12:02.893]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[00:12:02.893 --> 00:12:04.755]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[00:12:04.755 --> 00:12:05.796]  Totally changed my life.
[00:12:05.796 --> 00:12:08.839]  I use TurboForce, BODY, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:09.420]  We're good.
[00:12:24.316 --> 00:12:26.677]  All of these things are known to be incredible.
[00:12:26.677 --> 00:12:33.460]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force of the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.981]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel in the body.
[00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:38.903]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[00:12:38.903 --> 00:12:40.903]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[00:12:40.903 --> 00:12:44.865]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[00:12:44.865 --> 00:12:47.626]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:48.467]  Thank you so much.
[00:12:48.467 --> 00:12:48.907]  God bless you.
[00:12:49.187 --> 00:12:53.030]  At InfoWarsLive, we always try to bring you game-changing products.
[00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:57.493]  Now, we've already been promoting and selling Super Silver Wound Gel for over a year.
[00:12:57.493 --> 00:12:58.554]  It's a bestseller.
[00:12:58.554 --> 00:12:59.434]  It is the best.

[00:13:19.881 --> 00:13:21.021]  And so much more.

[00:13:51.630 --> 00:14:05.244]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:10.289]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:28.751]  Now, this is the first broadcast of September 2019.
[00:14:28.751 --> 00:14:35.594]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, here live on the Sunday edition.
[00:14:35.594 --> 00:14:40.156]  I will be live tomorrow on the Monday edition for September 2nd, 2019.
[00:14:40.156 --> 00:14:43.537]  You can bet your boots.
[00:14:43.537 --> 00:14:49.000]  Now, we're obviously at a major historical crossroads right now.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.183]  We are in the middle of a global quickening, and the Democratic Party
[00:14:56.559 --> 00:15:00.921]  Represents the powerful global corporate interests that want to disarm dumbed-down population.
[00:15:00.921 --> 00:15:03.222]  They want a post-human world.
[00:15:03.222 --> 00:15:07.484]  To have a post-human world, you've got to disarm the people you want to get rid of.
[00:15:07.484 --> 00:15:14.507]  And by the way, if you're a new viewer or listener, you're saying, what do you mean a post-human world?
[00:15:14.507 --> 00:15:23.331]  Well, NBC last week had the big cover story that humans will soon be obsolete, humans will be extinct.
[00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:24.872]  That's a good thing because we're bad,
[00:15:26.104 --> 00:15:31.205]  And it'll be good for the environment when the cyborgs rise, that's humans that merge with machines.
[00:15:31.205 --> 00:15:36.146]  Really, those will just be humans that are slaves of big tech.
[00:15:36.146 --> 00:15:43.407]  But they sell it like it's the ultimate status and how all the followers really become cool kids.
[00:15:43.407 --> 00:15:48.028]  There's the headline, Cyborgs Will Replace Humans and Remake the World, James Lovelock says.
[00:15:48.028 --> 00:15:52.889]  And you tune into Discovery Channel or any of these shows, and it's like, there's too many humans!
[00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:53.689]  We need to get rid of them!
[00:15:54.514 --> 00:15:55.775]  We're gonna merge the machines!
[00:15:55.775 --> 00:15:57.756]  I don't believe in God, but I'm gonna become one!
[00:15:57.756 --> 00:16:00.337]  Ray Kurzweil!
[00:16:00.337 --> 00:16:04.779]  So they say this, and they do this, and they push this everywhere.
[00:16:04.779 --> 00:16:05.940]  In every way.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:17.845]  And then they tell us, oh, but we care about human life, and we care about the children, we care about people that get shot by guns, and we cry, and Beto cries, and then he kinda looks up and smiles and laughs.
[00:16:17.845 --> 00:16:20.707]  Then we can pull in Beto laughing in, uh,
[00:16:23.655 --> 00:16:26.216]  El Paso, a month ago.
[00:16:26.216 --> 00:16:32.958]  He does that weird demonic... It's terrible, they're dying!
[00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.660]  Oh, they don't care about the 115 million killed by the Communist Chinese in their own country.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:40.101]  They don't care about 50 million killed by Lenin and Stalin.
[00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:43.502]  They don't care about any of that.
[00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:47.364]  They don't care about the hundreds of thousands dead and tortured to death in Cuba, probably millions.
[00:16:47.364 --> 00:16:51.025]  Same thing in Venezuela.
[00:16:51.025 --> 00:16:51.125]  No.
[00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:55.027]  But they know you've got a conscience.
[00:16:55.027 --> 00:16:56.268]  And they know you care.
[00:16:56.268 --> 00:17:11.556]  And they know when you hear about seven people dead, including the shooter, in Odessa, outside a mall in a movie theater, because the cops pulled this guy over, and then he just starts randomly shooting people.
[00:17:11.556 --> 00:17:15.459]  Including a 17-month-old child amongst those that are injured.
[00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:17.820]  Well, we have the special report that really needs to be shared.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.602]  It's really powerful, that I aired earlier.
[00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:23.303]  Pieces of.
[00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:30.045]  The headline is the zombie apocalypse is real and it's here.
[00:17:30.045 --> 00:17:48.531]  It's not undead walking around killing people but it's just this week a woman in Georgia walking by a mother and a father with their daughter and their son stabbing the three-year-old boy almost cutting his nose off going for his eyes but stabbing big giant holes in his face with a 10-inch butcher knife then trying to kill the little girl the mother and the father.
[00:17:50.046 --> 00:17:57.087]  One female officer put her in cuffs and just led her away.
[00:17:57.087 --> 00:17:59.508]  That story's on InfoWars.com with the video.
[00:17:59.508 --> 00:18:11.711]  And then another woman just attacked an Uber driver for no reason, tried to ram through his windshield, tried to go through the windshield, then began biting him like something out of a zombie movie.
[00:18:11.711 --> 00:18:17.572]  Maybe we should roll some B-roll of that, just, you know, from a special report that we've got on the zombie apocalypse.
[00:18:17.572 --> 00:18:18.172]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:18:18.172 --> 00:18:18.472]  Perfect.
[00:18:19.864 --> 00:18:23.847]  And there's so many of these, I can't even play them all for you.
[00:18:23.847 --> 00:18:42.341]  Or then there's the guy running around in Tampa who just killed his sister and her daughter, his niece, for no reason, and then going and humping the groundskeeper and screaming satanic things and trying to bite him, trying to rape him and bite him.
[00:18:42.341 --> 00:18:43.862]  And then there's more videos.
[00:18:43.862 --> 00:18:48.846]  I've got probably, I don't know, five articles and a bunch of video of people in Sweden
[00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:58.292]  France, Germany, England, and Italy.
[00:18:58.292 --> 00:19:16.324]  Of Muslims from Afghanistan and from Morocco and from Iraq walking up to people at bus stations, and of course they're all white, and targeting men, women, and children, and one guy stabbed
[00:19:18.271 --> 00:19:40.946]  Ten people, wounded nine, killed one, and there's an incredible haunting video up on InfoWars.com about it in France, where a Frenchman walks up, yeah, this has got the video, and doesn't even attack the guy, pleads with him, and then the Muslim drops the knife.
[00:19:40.946 --> 00:19:46.990]  So this big French guy comes up, can't grab the butcher knife away, gets right in his striking distance, you know the guy's got a butcher knife,
[00:19:50.746 --> 00:19:54.630]  Risk his life not to punch that guy in the throat.
[00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:57.312]  That's domestication right there, folks.
[00:19:57.312 --> 00:20:01.776]  You take the knife away from him and you jam it up through his throat.
[00:20:01.776 --> 00:20:06.580]  But see, you go to Afghanistan, they just randomly kill each other for no reason.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:11.284]  You go to Pakistan, they just randomly kill each other for no reason.
[00:20:11.284 --> 00:20:12.085]  It's very, very sad.
[00:20:12.085 --> 00:20:13.687]  A lot of it is the extreme inbreeding.
[00:20:14.653 --> 00:20:17.214]  Pakistanis are 2% of the population in the UK.
[00:20:17.214 --> 00:20:18.835]  They're 37% of deformities.
[00:20:18.835 --> 00:20:19.695]  Very sad.
[00:20:19.695 --> 00:20:22.137]  But marrying your sister ain't good.
[00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:25.518]  Whether you're British royalty or whether you're Pakistani.
[00:20:25.518 --> 00:20:27.739]  It's very dangerous.
[00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:28.400]  Very dangerous.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.302]  Causes a lot of psychotic activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[00:20:32.302 --> 00:20:33.402]  The level of mental illness.
[00:20:33.402 --> 00:20:35.883]  I mean, just watch the videos for yourself.
[00:20:35.883 --> 00:20:39.205]  But see, dozens stabbed to death all over Europe.
[00:20:40.345 --> 00:21:06.682]  Almost all by Muslims, who do not allow white people in their areas, and no-go zones, and now they're expanding outside the no-go zones, and they look and act like zombies, just like the white dude in Tampa, the monster, killing his sister, and her daughter, his nephew, his niece, and you look at their faces, they have the same, and then he's just humping the greenskeeper after he's killed his sister.
[00:21:08.447 --> 00:21:13.828]  And trying to choke him while he tries to rape him.
[00:21:13.828 --> 00:21:19.390]  So, we'll play Beto O'Rourke, who says, oh, he's so sad it's effed up.
[00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:20.870]  Notice how CNN cusses.
[00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:22.910]  Everybody else can cuss, but not a conservative show.
[00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:25.071]  You know, the FCC would come after us.
[00:21:25.071 --> 00:21:27.371]  But he cusses because it's so woke and so real.
[00:21:27.371 --> 00:21:32.693]  And I've got all these stacks of articles.
[00:21:32.693 --> 00:21:33.653]  And all these videos.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:42.423]  Of the Islamists raping and killing and attacking and bombing and running people over with cars.
[00:21:42.423 --> 00:21:44.144]  It's never on our nose.
[00:21:44.144 --> 00:21:47.966]  And they want Infowars.com and Newswars.com shut down so you don't see it.
[00:21:47.966 --> 00:21:50.267]  And look, I'm not saying all the Muslims are bad people.
[00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:55.070]  The most dangerous thing to a Muslim is other Muslims.
[00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.431]  They're the biggest victims of Islam.
[00:21:56.431 --> 00:21:59.132]  But Islam has been expanding for 1400 years, taking the world over.
[00:21:59.132 --> 00:22:04.515]  The UN admits hundreds of thousands of Christians are killed a year by Muslims worldwide from Indonesia,
[00:22:05.762 --> 00:22:12.284]  To Nigeria, to France, and there's no coverage of it.
[00:22:12.284 --> 00:22:15.585]  Oh, but you get killed in mass shootings.
[00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:18.886]  Used to be about 100 a year in senseless mass shootings.
[00:22:18.886 --> 00:22:20.927]  You don't count gang-related.
[00:22:20.927 --> 00:22:22.127]  Now it's up to about 150.
[00:22:22.127 --> 00:22:24.908]  It's terrible.
[00:22:24.908 --> 00:22:27.109]  My goodness, it's a horrible thing.
[00:22:27.109 --> 00:22:29.590]  But how many people died on Texas roads today?
[00:22:30.481 --> 00:22:32.863]  I guarantee you, it's in the thousands.
[00:22:32.863 --> 00:22:34.404]  They've got signs up.
[00:22:34.404 --> 00:22:41.289]  I saw it on the sign last week, that so far, what's 3,000-something people have died on Texas roads.
[00:22:41.289 --> 00:22:44.391]  Had a big flashing government billboard up, usually has Amber Alerts.
[00:22:44.391 --> 00:22:50.075]  Talk about 3,200-something Texans have died on Texas roads this year.
[00:22:50.075 --> 00:22:52.596]  But you see that being hyped up everywhere else?
[00:22:52.596 --> 00:22:53.297]  No.
[00:22:53.297 --> 00:22:56.639]  The Highway Patrol, the Transportation Department is like, hey, drive safe.
[00:22:56.639 --> 00:22:57.440]  Safe following this.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.861]  This is dangerous what you're doing.
[00:23:00.592 --> 00:23:03.673]  So you got 150 people or so killed in mass shootings.
[00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:04.594]  It's the end of the world.
[00:23:04.594 --> 00:23:06.934]  Everybody else that has guns has to turn their guns in.
[00:23:06.934 --> 00:23:10.976]  It's all our fault.
[00:23:10.976 --> 00:23:14.457]  Let's go out to break with Beto O'Rourke.
[00:23:14.457 --> 00:23:17.658]  Blaming gun owners and saying he wants to confiscate all semi-autos.
[00:23:17.658 --> 00:23:19.279]  Here it is.
[00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:20.540]  Congressman, welcome.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.580]  Let's start on the shooting.
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.722]  I want to play for our viewers your reaction at a campaign stop last night.
[00:23:28.424 --> 00:23:34.253]  Don't know what the motivation is, do not yet know the firearms that were used or how they acquired them.
[00:23:34.253 --> 00:23:35.696]  But we do know this is f***ed up.
[00:23:40.302 --> 00:23:48.926]  Yeah, the rhetoric that we've used, the thoughts and prayers that you just referred to, it has done nothing to stop the epidemic of gun violence.
[00:23:48.926 --> 00:24:05.135]  To protect our kids, our families, our fellow Americans in public places, at a Walmart in El Paso where 22 were killed, in Sutherland Springs, in a church, one or two a day, all over this country, 100 killed daily in the United States of America.
[00:24:05.135 --> 00:24:09.017]  We're averaging about 300 mass shootings a year.
[00:24:09.537 --> 00:24:11.138]  No other country comes close.
[00:24:11.138 --> 00:24:12.519]  So, yes, this is f***ed up.
[00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:23.026]  And if we don't call it out for what it is, if we're not able to speak clearly, if we're not able to act decisively, then we will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America.
[00:24:23.026 --> 00:24:24.267]  And I cannot accept that.
[00:24:24.267 --> 00:24:30.071]  And so, we're going to speak as defiantly and as strongly as we can, but we're also going to take action.
[00:24:30.071 --> 00:24:35.775]  Universal background checks, red flag laws, an end to the sales of weapons of war, and buying those AK-47s and AR-15s back.
[00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:40.912]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:44.275]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[00:24:44.275 --> 00:24:45.516]  But it's very exciting.
[00:24:45.516 --> 00:24:47.858]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:24:47.858 --> 00:24:49.359]  It's got all of these benefits.
[00:24:49.359 --> 00:24:50.460]  Too many to mention.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.721]  But it's revolutionary.
[00:24:51.721 --> 00:24:52.662]  It's brand new.
[00:24:52.662 --> 00:24:53.503]  People are going to love it.
[00:24:53.503 --> 00:24:55.665]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream.

[00:25:41.901 --> 00:25:43.022]  We're here in Hong Kong.
[00:25:43.022 --> 00:25:45.482]  This is Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[00:25:45.482 --> 00:25:49.483]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Rees for the next week.

[00:25:57.164 --> 00:26:05.225]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[00:26:05.225 --> 00:26:07.966]  We have Dan Lyman covering InfoWars Europe.
[00:26:08.446 --> 00:26:10.989]  Paul Joseph Watson in the UK.
[00:26:10.989 --> 00:26:14.573]  Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American heartland.
[00:26:14.573 --> 00:26:21.741]  And from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[00:26:21.741 --> 00:26:25.465]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.
[00:26:25.465 --> 00:26:26.907]  We have to keep winning!
[00:26:26.907 --> 00:26:28.168]  We have to win more!
[00:26:28.348 --> 00:26:30.711]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:26:30.711 --> 00:26:42.563]  You have gone to Infowarsstore.com and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need!
[00:26:42.563 --> 00:26:45.206]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:26:59.554 --> 00:27:03.636]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:27:03.636 --> 00:27:11.939]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:11.939 --> 00:27:13.339]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
[00:27:13.339 --> 00:27:15.080]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.441]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:27:17.441 --> 00:27:27.845]  And some stations don't carry this five minutes, so I'm going to come back, start the next segment, and get into the tragic shooting in Odessa, which is getting more coverage than the giant.
[00:27:28.655 --> 00:27:44.801]  Magnitude 5.0 earthquake that hit Alaska, or the Type 5 hurricane at the same time, Dorian, that's also bearing down on the East Coast, which could potentially kill thousands of people.
[00:27:44.801 --> 00:27:54.365]  But again, it was Stalin that said, 10,000 men die, it's a statistic, one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:27:56.101 --> 00:27:57.462]  Because it personalizes it.
[00:27:57.462 --> 00:28:06.829]  You see, they don't personalize the millions of babies that get aborted every year before they're born, or the tens of thousands that are kept alive now and harvested.
[00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:08.250]  They don't do that.
[00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:10.552]  They don't humanize them.
[00:28:10.552 --> 00:28:20.280]  But when they want to humanize somebody like John McCain, boy, do they make that corrupt Keating Five gangster thug look great, or George Herbert Walker Bush, the New World Order anti-gun piece of crap.
[00:28:22.096 --> 00:28:29.981]  So we've got quite an hour lined up for you, because I'm going to go through all this and finish up on that, and then I'm going to get to the geopolitical developments, the huge developments with Joe Biden.
[00:28:29.981 --> 00:28:31.982]  I told you he's not going to make it to the race.
[00:28:31.982 --> 00:28:34.164]  I told you that first three months ago.
[00:28:34.164 --> 00:28:35.705]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:28:35.705 --> 00:28:37.206]  I'm not bragging, folks.
[00:28:37.206 --> 00:28:41.629]  You can assess somebody and tell you whether they can make it or whether they can't make it.
[00:28:41.629 --> 00:28:44.671]  But you did hear it here first, because I'm not a follower, you see.
[00:28:45.936 --> 00:28:53.500]  And that's the answer is not being a bunch of damn followers that just regurgitate what the establishment puts out, but your own research.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:29:01.564]  Speaking of that, we were amongst the first to expose in 2004 that Google was using microphones in your computer to listen to you.
[00:29:01.564 --> 00:29:10.189]  And now it's come out this week that they put spy tech on it to watch and listen to you even when you turn it off, even when you say you don't want those cookies turned on, even when you disable that.
[00:29:10.189 --> 00:29:11.730]  And it's mainstream news.
[00:29:13.183 --> 00:29:22.526]  Well, even the Associated Press and Yahoo Finance tells you, Apple and Google are all listening to you and watching you, even when you don't want them to.
[00:29:22.526 --> 00:29:25.247]  And they're selling the data, and the Chinese government's doing it too.
[00:29:25.247 --> 00:29:29.989]  See, all this stuff's mainstream news now.
[00:29:29.989 --> 00:29:31.730]  It's all mainstream news.
[00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:42.614]  Speaking of dehumanization and not valuing humans, here's a piece where we get into the fact that this was like six-year-old piece, five-year-old piece, where they're heating hospitals with the dead bodies of children.
[00:29:42.614 --> 00:29:42.914]  Here it is.
[00:29:50.532 --> 00:29:54.788]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[00:29:56.019 --> 00:30:00.181]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:30:00.181 --> 00:30:06.443]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:30:06.443 --> 00:30:11.464]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:30:11.464 --> 00:30:16.446]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:30:16.446 --> 00:30:18.947]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:30:18.947 --> 00:30:21.048]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:30:21.588 --> 00:30:26.436]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:30:26.436 --> 00:30:29.440]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.046]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:30:33.046 --> 00:30:34.668]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:30:37.298 --> 00:30:49.830]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.791]  So enjoy the flavor!
[00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:56.436]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[00:30:56.436 --> 00:30:58.417]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:30:58.417 --> 00:31:00.279]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:01.600]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:03.202]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:31:03.462 --> 00:31:14.831]  ...is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:31:14.831 --> 00:31:19.214]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:31:19.214 --> 00:31:25.599]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:31:33.692 --> 00:31:36.318]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:31:36.318 --> 00:31:41.229]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:31:41.229 --> 00:31:42.913]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:31:47.569 --> 00:31:51.930]  Banned.video is the answer to censorship.
[00:31:51.930 --> 00:32:07.455]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[00:32:07.455 --> 00:32:09.156]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:09.156 --> 00:32:10.496]  It's now live.
[00:32:10.496 --> 00:32:12.457]  Banned.video.
[00:32:12.457 --> 00:32:16.698]  Banned.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David
[00:32:16.758 --> 00:32:17.038]  I think?
[00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:55.326]  The global corporations that are setting up a planetary world government
[00:33:15.206 --> 00:33:32.949]  are basically to accompany the most psychopathic, sociopathic, cold-blooded, robotic, reptilian-type autocrats you could really imagine.
[00:33:32.949 --> 00:33:37.130]  And they are selling the post-human world.
[00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.671]  They're saying everybody's obsolete.
[00:33:39.671 --> 00:33:40.991]  And then they're greasing the skids
[00:33:42.691 --> 00:33:51.178]  To make us as immoral and decadent and dumb and lazy and shallow as we can be.
[00:33:51.178 --> 00:33:54.601]  To have a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:33:54.601 --> 00:33:58.144]  Because when you have an industrialized world, and when people
[00:33:59.306 --> 00:34:05.451]  Even the poorest people can live better than kings did a thousand years ago.
[00:34:05.451 --> 00:34:09.413]  You're going to have a lot of people who are going to become lazy, decadent slobs.
[00:34:09.413 --> 00:34:22.223]  It was the French historian, philosopher, statesman Victor Hugo that said, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[00:34:24.505 --> 00:34:27.526]  Adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[00:34:27.526 --> 00:34:43.053]  And it really is true that anyone that's seen somebody set a company up, say a grandfather, who did it by the bootstraps, and then you see the children that take over the company, they're a little more lazy, a little more decadent.
[00:34:43.053 --> 00:34:52.437]  By the time you get to their grandchildren, on average, you're dealing with completely lazy, disconnected, stupid, hedonist.
[00:34:54.173 --> 00:34:55.493]  On average.
[00:34:55.493 --> 00:34:57.694]  On average.
[00:34:57.694 --> 00:35:17.398]  And then you take that evil, corrupt people come in to those power structures, who are first generation, but they're corrupt, and then they manipulate those corrupt elites that actually built things, and then the really evil people take over, and then you get a V.I.
[00:35:17.398 --> 00:35:21.559]  Lenin, then you get an Adolf Hitler, then you get a Mao Zedong.
[00:35:21.559 --> 00:35:23.099]  And then you've got a big problem.
[00:35:24.158 --> 00:35:27.839]  And then hundreds of millions of people die.
[00:35:27.839 --> 00:35:50.346]  And so what I'm getting at here is that the mainstream media does not give a rat's ass about the 17 people that got wounded and the 6 that died, 7 including the shooter in Odessa.
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:55.582]  I mean, Zbigniew Brzezinski wanted all the guns taken from the American people.
[00:35:55.582 --> 00:36:00.425]  His daughter wants them all taken on MSNBC with her psycho Joe husband.
[00:36:00.425 --> 00:36:09.971]  He's found the dead intern in his office, but it's okay because he's above the law.
[00:36:09.971 --> 00:36:20.258]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in a couple of his books bragging about how he helped put Pol Pot in and how Pol Pot exterminated everybody.
[00:36:22.659 --> 00:36:27.583]  And how that was used to destabilize Vietnam via Cambodia.
[00:36:27.583 --> 00:36:33.747]  And how he's a master tactician because he got them all to kill each other.
[00:36:33.747 --> 00:36:34.428]  Pretty evil, huh?
[00:36:36.786 --> 00:36:45.972]  He's the guy that tricked the Russians into invading Afghanistan by funding the Mujahideen in 1979 to attack the Russian underbelly first.
[00:36:45.972 --> 00:36:48.273]  I'm not lionizing the Soviet Russians.
[00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:53.557]  But you don't do something more evil than they would do to then beat them and then say you're still the good guy.
[00:36:53.557 --> 00:36:54.898]  So Brzezinski wanted your guns.
[00:36:54.898 --> 00:36:57.619]  He died a couple years ago.
[00:36:57.619 --> 00:37:00.601]  But he'd fund mass murder and would set it up.
[00:37:00.601 --> 00:37:02.803]  They killed 30% of the population of Cambodia.
[00:37:04.318 --> 00:37:06.139]  These people don't care about you.
[00:37:06.139 --> 00:37:20.165]  Mainstream media would promote Oxycontin and Fentanyl until Trump got in, and we've seen a tenfold increase, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and the FDA, and the DEA, of the amount of opioid abuse.
[00:37:20.165 --> 00:37:27.289]  You can't swing a stick and not hit somebody that's died from it, or is dying from it, or has been, you know, ruined their life on it.
[00:37:27.289 --> 00:37:28.910]  It's just an epidemic.
[00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:29.730]  It's all over the place.
[00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.690]  It touches everybody.
[00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.211]  It touches me.
[00:37:32.211 --> 00:37:33.532]  I don't, I hate this stuff.
[00:37:33.532 --> 00:37:34.072]  Can't even take it.
[00:37:35.913 --> 00:37:36.974]  But it's touched me.
[00:37:36.974 --> 00:37:41.477]  I know people, very close, this has happened to.
[00:37:41.477 --> 00:37:57.266]  So when they wave the bloody shirt and say, you as gun owners are guilty, you need to understand that your right to own guns caused this guy to go kill six people and caused the other Antifa psychopath to go kill 20 people at the Walmart.
[00:37:57.266 --> 00:38:00.168]  And he was Antifa on his social media.
[00:38:00.168 --> 00:38:02.570]  They took it down and said he was a Trump supporter.
[00:38:04.107 --> 00:38:06.048]  The other guy they didn't take down in time.
[00:38:06.048 --> 00:38:12.972]  He was Antifa, and a devil worshipper, and into pedophilia, because they always are.
[00:38:12.972 --> 00:38:19.635]  There's always some weird crazy-eyed guy in a black outfit who wants to go see the devil.
[00:38:19.635 --> 00:38:22.757]  And he told everybody at the school, I'm gonna kill everybody.
[00:38:22.757 --> 00:38:24.958]  And the police were called, and nothing was done.
[00:38:24.958 --> 00:38:28.320]  Just like the shooter last year.
[00:38:30.242 --> 00:38:33.464]  On Valentine's Day, he'd been kicked out of school for six months.
[00:38:33.464 --> 00:38:40.907]  Cruz, who got to commit all these crimes because there was a liberal law passed that if you're a minority, you get to commit all these crimes and not go to jail.
[00:38:40.907 --> 00:38:44.809]  He wasn't even Hispanic.
[00:38:44.809 --> 00:38:46.910]  He was adopted by people that were Hispanic.
[00:38:48.933 --> 00:38:53.616]  Because his name was Cruz, he didn't go to jail for vandalism and robbery.
[00:38:53.616 --> 00:38:59.060]  He threatened to kill people and had the police called on him 44 times!
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.941]  He was known as School Shooter!
[00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:06.104]  He walked around going, bang, bang, you're dead, I'm gonna kill you to good-looking girls!
[00:39:06.104 --> 00:39:13.149]  Let's pull up the image of the Parkland, Florida shooter, please.
[00:39:13.149 --> 00:39:17.192]  When he was arrested, those crazy eyes, just like the eyes of all the other shooters.
[00:39:19.735 --> 00:39:21.156]  They're demon possessed, folks.
[00:39:21.156 --> 00:39:27.779]  They're told by the media that hypes up mass shootings since 1999 with Harrison Kleibold that go out and kill people and you'll be famous.
[00:39:27.779 --> 00:39:28.960]  And there's big studies out.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.120]  Just type it in.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:37.524]  Studies show media intense coverage of mass shooters makes them do it.
[00:39:37.524 --> 00:39:38.884]  People say, well, why are you doing it?
[00:39:38.884 --> 00:39:42.506]  Because we have to counter what they're doing and tell them to stop it.
[00:39:42.506 --> 00:39:45.968]  Oh, you don't see any mainstream media telling you of all the studies.
[00:39:51.749 --> 00:39:52.849]  Talk about crazy eyes.
[00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:54.830]  Just pull up him being arrested.
[00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:55.531]  That's his mugshot.
[00:39:55.531 --> 00:40:00.372]  Pull up Parkland shooters being arrested, being apprehended.
[00:40:00.372 --> 00:40:05.735]  You'll see him looking up like this desperate zombie, just like all the others.
[00:40:05.735 --> 00:40:19.060]  And so because there's all these crazy zombie people, we're then supposed to give our guns over so we can live like Chicago that has 2,000 plus deaths a year.
[00:40:20.504 --> 00:40:24.528]  Or Baltimore that's got 1,500 deaths a year.
[00:40:24.528 --> 00:40:31.174]  Or all the other places that have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 times the average.
[00:40:31.174 --> 00:40:40.182]  Last time I checked, Chicago has 14 times the average homicide rate of the United States.
[00:40:40.182 --> 00:40:43.265]  Because they take the guns.
[00:40:43.265 --> 00:40:44.766]  And then all the people that have them are criminals.
[00:40:44.766 --> 00:40:45.948]  And I know our audience knows this.
[00:40:47.418 --> 00:40:48.538]  They put this idea out.
[00:40:48.538 --> 00:40:49.679]  Something must be done.
[00:40:49.679 --> 00:40:54.480]  We must never have another mass shooting.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.620]  You heard Beto earlier.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:03.302]  He said there are 300 mass shootings a year.
[00:41:03.302 --> 00:41:08.223]  They count if more than one person shot as a mass shooting.
[00:41:08.223 --> 00:41:14.285]  On average, we've had Professor Lott and other top statisticians.
[00:41:14.285 --> 00:41:15.665]  I mean, he's one of the top guys in the world.
[00:41:18.055 --> 00:41:30.478]  And when I had him on like two years ago, the average was 57 people killed in real school mass shootings.
[00:41:30.478 --> 00:41:32.718]  And if you add all the other businesses and things, it was a little over 100.
[00:41:32.718 --> 00:41:35.559]  So it's gone up some now.
[00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:36.579]  I've tried to put the numbers together.
[00:41:36.579 --> 00:41:40.720]  I think it's like about 115 right now this year.
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.660]  That's still terrible.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:47.923]  But again, 3,000 plus people have died already this year in Texas on the highways.
[00:41:47.923 --> 00:41:50.524]  If you believe the big highway signs that tell you, the big flashing signs.
[00:41:50.524 --> 00:41:54.427]  And I know it's probably above that.
[00:41:54.427 --> 00:41:55.247]  Again, is that okay?
[00:41:55.247 --> 00:41:55.587]  No.
[00:41:55.587 --> 00:41:57.388]  But we're still going to drive our cars.
[00:41:57.388 --> 00:42:04.953]  Just because somebody wrecks a car, is drunk in a car, runs over somebody in a car because they're ISIS, I don't lose my car.
[00:42:04.953 --> 00:42:07.515]  I don't lose my right to drive because somebody else is bad.
[00:42:09.465 --> 00:42:16.531]  There are over 10,000 people a year that get beaten to death with things like baseball bats and clubs.
[00:42:16.531 --> 00:42:17.191]  Look at the numbers.
[00:42:17.191 --> 00:42:20.114]  You don't say, don't let baseball teams have baseball bats.
[00:42:20.114 --> 00:42:21.375]  Don't let people have butcher knives.
[00:42:21.375 --> 00:42:25.398]  This woman stabbed this little kid in the face for no reason in Georgia last week with a butcher knife.
[00:42:25.398 --> 00:42:27.159]  Do we take all our butcher knives away?
[00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:28.901]  In England, they're making you get a license for one.
[00:42:30.808 --> 00:42:31.769]  So it's happening, folks.
[00:42:31.769 --> 00:42:38.953]  They're trying to blame the general public for something that's still incredibly rare, but the media hypes up and creates a perception of this epidemic.
[00:42:38.953 --> 00:42:40.814]  We have to get the truth out about that.
[00:42:40.814 --> 00:42:44.136]  The answer, though, to senseless violence that is increasing is to defend yourself.
[00:42:47.267 --> 00:42:56.855]  There are only a few days left for you to get DNA Force Plus at 50% off and get a free bottle of Carnivore 90 for free.

[00:43:06.923 --> 00:43:11.186]  DNA Force Plus is our flagship product and needs no introduction.
[00:43:11.186 --> 00:43:17.991]  But Carnivore is so amazing that I want to offer you a free bottle of it so you can experience how great it is.
[00:43:17.991 --> 00:43:22.835]  We will be out of Carnivore in just the next week or so at current sales levels.
[00:43:22.835 --> 00:43:25.797]  I'm doing this because it's such an important product for people.
[00:43:25.797 --> 00:43:30.280]  I want those of you on the fence to experience it like so many others have.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:30.681]  So again,
[00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:36.871]  We are running this special as long as our stock of Carnivore 90 is still here.

[00:43:50.445 --> 00:43:54.831]  Now, we've already been promoting and selling Super Silver Wound Gel for over a year.
[00:43:54.831 --> 00:43:55.873]  It's a bestseller.
[00:43:55.873 --> 00:43:57.575]  It is the best you can get.
[00:43:57.575 --> 00:44:00.680]  A 100% review rate on power reviews.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:01.862]  Well, now we teamed up with them.
[00:44:02.222 --> 00:44:05.824]  And came out with two different types of skin cream.
[00:44:05.824 --> 00:44:08.386]  One is naturally scented with grapefruit essential oils.
[00:44:08.386 --> 00:44:10.087]  The other is unscented.
[00:44:10.087 --> 00:44:15.511]  It's got hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, essential oils from grapefruit.
[00:44:15.511 --> 00:44:18.353]  It's got coconut oil and so much more.
[00:44:18.353 --> 00:44:20.554]  And this patented nano-type
[00:44:20.774 --> 00:44:24.176]  Of silver that has been proven to be the most effective and the best.
[00:44:24.176 --> 00:44:30.199]  It's got all these other great vitamins and compounds that are known to be wonderful for your skin.
[00:44:30.199 --> 00:44:36.101]  If you're a woman, man, if you were a child, we are so excited about the new Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:44:36.101 --> 00:44:38.903]  We have it in the smaller tube and the large tube.
[00:44:38.903 --> 00:44:42.104]  It's very, very affordable and it funds our operations.
[00:44:42.104 --> 00:44:44.966]  Check it out today and get yours at Infowarslife.com.
[00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:47.791]  Josh in Washington.
[00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:48.332]  You're on the air.
[00:44:48.332 --> 00:44:48.872]  Go ahead.
[00:44:48.872 --> 00:44:50.033]  Alex, God bless you.
[00:44:50.033 --> 00:44:52.616]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:44:52.616 --> 00:44:58.582]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[00:44:58.582 --> 00:44:59.263]  Ooh, yeah.
[00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.624]  Showing your brain getting frat.
[00:45:00.624 --> 00:45:02.486]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[00:45:02.486 --> 00:45:03.507]  Totally changed my life.
[00:45:03.507 --> 00:45:06.570]  I use TurboForce, BodyEase, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:07.291]  We're good.
[00:45:22.047 --> 00:45:24.389]  All of these things are known to be incredible.
[00:45:24.389 --> 00:45:31.176]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[00:45:31.176 --> 00:45:33.698]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[00:45:33.698 --> 00:45:36.861]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[00:45:36.861 --> 00:45:38.622]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[00:45:38.622 --> 00:45:42.606]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[00:45:42.606 --> 00:45:45.428]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[00:45:45.428 --> 00:45:46.129]  Thank you so much.
[00:45:46.129 --> 00:45:46.650]  God bless you.
[00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:53.414]  Super Mel Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[00:45:53.414 --> 00:46:01.558]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:02.839]  It is cold-pressed.
[00:46:02.839 --> 00:46:09.282]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[00:46:09.282 --> 00:46:10.463]  It's not boiled.
[00:46:10.463 --> 00:46:11.243]  It's not heated.
[00:46:11.243 --> 00:46:12.404]  It's never been dried.
[00:46:12.404 --> 00:46:13.585]  It's taken from fresh
[00:46:14.105 --> 00:46:14.905]  Herbs.
[00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:17.606]  That's why it's so strong.
[00:46:17.606 --> 00:46:21.387]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[00:46:21.387 --> 00:46:35.350]  And I'm so excited about Supramel Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supramel Vitality a 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.810]  We're going to sell out of this very quickly.
[00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:41.613]  But it's an offer so that you experience how amazing both these products are.
[00:46:41.613 --> 00:46:49.979]  Secure yours at InfoWarsStore.com today or InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:49.979 --> 00:46:52.621]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:02.881 --> 00:47:05.683]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:47:05.683 --> 00:47:06.424]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:06.424 --> 00:47:11.247]  We're live, broadcasting worldwide on a Sunday, the first day of September, 2019.
[00:47:11.247 --> 00:47:13.909]  Can you believe we're about to hit 2020?
[00:47:13.909 --> 00:47:16.211]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:47:16.211 --> 00:47:17.952]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:47:17.952 --> 00:47:18.973]  Mao took the guns.
[00:47:18.973 --> 00:47:21.175]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:47:21.175 --> 00:47:25.858]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:47:33.945 --> 00:47:39.389]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:42.511]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[00:47:42.511 --> 00:47:53.338]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:47:53.338 --> 00:47:53.678]  Boom!
[00:47:56.018 --> 00:47:56.959]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:56.959 --> 00:47:59.361]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:20.512]  Well, Beto O'Rourke, when he's not giggling and laughing about the dead people in El Paso, is out saying it's effing time to register your guns and then confiscate all the semi-autos.
[00:48:20.512 --> 00:48:21.452]  That's what he's saying.
[00:48:21.452 --> 00:48:32.234]  Remember back when they used to deny that with their own internal Brady campaign and the Soros-funded groups and Bloomberg, their internal documents would come out.
[00:48:32.234 --> 00:48:35.055]  They'd say, our plan is a civilian disarmament.
[00:48:35.834 --> 00:48:40.437]  And they signed on to the UN treaty, Bill Clinton did, but it never got ratified.
[00:48:40.437 --> 00:48:44.960]  Then Bush almost passed it in 2001.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:49:01.832]  The UNIDIR, United Nations Small Arms Convention, and it said right there in the treaty that never got passed by Congress, civilian firearms ownership threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[00:49:01.832 --> 00:49:04.074]  That's a totally true statement, except for one word, legitimate.
[00:49:04.821 --> 00:49:06.462]  Let's take the word legitimate out.
[00:49:06.462 --> 00:49:13.567]  Civilian ownership of firearms threatens the power monopoly of the state.
[00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:14.928]  Power monopoly.
[00:49:14.928 --> 00:49:16.029]  Tyranny.
[00:49:16.029 --> 00:49:17.150]  Mao Zedong.
[00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:17.870]  Hitler.
[00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:18.651]  Stalin.
[00:49:18.651 --> 00:49:19.752]  Mao.
[00:49:19.752 --> 00:49:20.472]  Pol Pot.
[00:49:20.472 --> 00:49:21.513]  Fidel Castro.
[00:49:21.513 --> 00:49:23.935]  Hugo Chavez.
[00:49:23.935 --> 00:49:27.457]  Mexico, only the government has the guts.
[00:49:27.457 --> 00:49:28.778]  And the cartels and the lawless.
[00:49:28.778 --> 00:49:33.221]  Once you do that, you have the lawless government, the lawless criminals.
[00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:34.302]  Because slaves are disarmed.
[00:49:36.809 --> 00:49:40.490]  And so you bet I'm harping on it this Sunday, because there's going to be more mass shootings in this country.
[00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:45.811]  There's going to be more stabbings, more bombings, more people running over folks.
[00:49:45.811 --> 00:49:49.832]  Because it's true that we peaked crime-wise in 1991.
[00:49:49.832 --> 00:49:52.732]  The FBI has these numbers.
[00:49:52.732 --> 00:49:53.592]  The 80s was hell.
[00:49:53.592 --> 00:49:54.352]  Early 90s were bad.
[00:49:54.352 --> 00:50:01.334]  I remember when I was growing up in Dallas, when it was the murder capital of the United States above Chicago, where there'd be up to 20 murders
[00:50:03.345 --> 00:50:05.185]  In one day, sometimes.
[00:50:05.185 --> 00:50:06.606]  In South Dallas.
[00:50:06.606 --> 00:50:08.286]  Drug-related.
[00:50:08.286 --> 00:50:15.928]  No one thought, hey, let's turn our guns in, because ten miles away, drug dealers are killing each other in a turf war.
[00:50:15.928 --> 00:50:20.569]  It's like Mexico has hundreds of thousands dead the last decade in their drug war.
[00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:21.629]  Many of them innocent people.
[00:50:21.629 --> 00:50:24.790]  Do we go, oh, let's turn our guns in, because there's criminals in Mexico!
[00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.010]  We'll be safe!
[00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.651]  It's asinine!
[00:50:28.651 --> 00:50:31.812]  You create an atmosphere for incredible
[00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:34.210]  Crime.
[00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:36.471]  When you take the guns.
[00:50:36.471 --> 00:50:40.592]  Unless you're domesticated Europe, where they had almost no crime.
[00:50:40.592 --> 00:50:42.433]  England was one of the safest places in the world.
[00:50:42.433 --> 00:50:47.194]  The British police, the bobbies, didn't carry weapons.
[00:50:47.194 --> 00:50:49.555]  They carry machine guns now.
[00:50:49.555 --> 00:50:54.016]  Because they brought in people from countries where everybody's killing each other.
[00:50:54.016 --> 00:50:55.336]  The Middle East.
[00:50:55.336 --> 00:50:57.337]  Dangerous areas of Asia.
[00:50:57.337 --> 00:50:58.617]  Dangerous areas of Eastern Europe.
[00:51:00.706 --> 00:51:05.689]  And now they have a higher crime rate in England than we have here on average.
[00:51:05.689 --> 00:51:09.291]  Oh, people aren't getting shot to death mainly, they're getting stabbed to death.
[00:51:09.291 --> 00:51:11.312]  Every few hours, in London alone.
[00:51:11.312 --> 00:51:15.774]  Acid attacks, all... But again, the establishment knows they're not always going to have bodyguards.
[00:51:15.774 --> 00:51:18.496]  They're going to live behind armored walls.
[00:51:18.496 --> 00:51:21.597]  They want the general public disarmed for total control.
[00:51:21.597 --> 00:51:24.819]  And I know as an audience you understand that.
[00:51:24.819 --> 00:51:26.620]  I know as an audience you get all of that.
[00:51:27.608 --> 00:51:29.729]  But that's where the Democrats say they're going.
[00:51:29.729 --> 00:51:37.794]  I mean, the New York Times this year, they've all come out and said, time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:41.916]  That's how 1776 started when the British came to take the guns.
[00:51:41.916 --> 00:51:45.258]  At Lexington, at Concord, at Bunker Hill.
[00:51:45.258 --> 00:51:49.621]  And again, I know this audience knows that.
[00:51:49.621 --> 00:51:53.523]  But coming up next segment, I've got articles right here where they're already
[00:51:55.342 --> 00:52:10.756]  Compensating firearms under red flag laws in multiple states from people that say things like, if Antifa starts killing us and coming to our houses to kill us, like I've said, we'll have to fight back.
[00:52:10.756 --> 00:52:11.957]  Well, I said that last year.
[00:52:11.957 --> 00:52:13.298]  I was banned from Twitter.
[00:52:13.298 --> 00:52:14.299]  They were going to people's houses.
[00:52:14.299 --> 00:52:16.060]  So they're going to kill people.
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:17.402]  They already shot Scalise.
[00:52:17.402 --> 00:52:19.764]  They already broke the ribs of Rand Paul.
[00:52:19.764 --> 00:52:21.906]  Antifa said we're going to go to Tucker Carlson's house.
[00:52:22.546 --> 00:52:23.687]  So we're gonna kill you?
[00:52:23.687 --> 00:52:27.290]  And I said, hey, if you're on Antifa's list, you better have a gun to protect yourself.
[00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:30.592]  And the news said, Jones threatens to kill reporters.
[00:52:30.592 --> 00:52:31.793]  Where was the video?
[00:52:31.793 --> 00:52:33.915]  Where was the audio?
[00:52:33.915 --> 00:52:38.038]  But the media said that, under red flag laws, I would be disarmed.
[00:52:38.038 --> 00:52:41.280]  You read what these people have in their guns taken said?
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.402]  They said what I said.
[00:52:44.402 --> 00:52:50.587]  They didn't go as far as Thomas Jefferson that said the tree of liberty needs to be watered from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:52:50.587 --> 00:52:51.768]  Boy, he'd have been red flagged long.
[00:52:52.762 --> 00:52:54.804]  No, Red Flag, we already have it on the books.
[00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.305]  We already have the process.
[00:52:56.305 --> 00:53:03.993]  People like Cruz said, 44 police reports, I'm gonna come kill everybody at the school.
[00:53:03.993 --> 00:53:13.742]  Well, buddy boy, you get put in a mental institution or a prison for that, and the next time you get out and you say it, we give you a lobotomy.
[00:53:13.742 --> 00:53:14.303]  How's that sound?
[00:53:17.082 --> 00:53:18.823]  See how that works?
[00:53:18.823 --> 00:53:21.886]  See, Antifa's the ones out saying, kill people, shoot people.
[00:53:21.886 --> 00:53:24.728]  They're the ones with the John Brown Gun Club saying, let's go kill cops.
[00:53:24.728 --> 00:53:27.630]  There was another firebombing of another ICE facility today.
[00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:31.813]  You didn't hear about that because the media won't cover it.
[00:53:31.813 --> 00:53:37.137]  There was a black young man that went and shot a whole bunch of people.
[00:53:37.137 --> 00:53:41.661]  What, he wounded 10 people at a football game.
[00:53:42.662 --> 00:53:44.744]  You didn't even see that on the news, did you?
[00:53:44.744 --> 00:53:46.927]  Because it doesn't fit into the white supremacist narrative.
[00:53:46.927 --> 00:53:56.038]  What we've got is the beginning of a zombie apocalypse in this country with the breakdown of morals and people hearing, hey, it's an option.
[00:53:56.038 --> 00:54:01.284]  Let me just go out and shoot a bunch of people at a football game, mainly fellow black people.
[00:54:03.234 --> 00:54:20.508]  Because the truth is, whether it's the white guy killing his sister and his nephew, or his niece, and chewing on the greenskeeper, or it's the black lady biting the guy in Atlanta, or it's the crazy white guy in Texas shooting people, or the crazy black guy at the football game, it's not what color they are, and it's not the gun.
[00:54:20.508 --> 00:54:22.049]  It's evil.
[00:54:22.049 --> 00:54:24.230]  It's craziness.
[00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:31.156]  And it's that the media has hyped all this up as if it's an option, something you could do.
[00:54:31.156 --> 00:54:32.297]  Something you should do.
[00:54:33.473 --> 00:54:34.433]  Let's play Beto O'Rourke.
[00:54:34.433 --> 00:54:36.434]  Here he is.
[00:54:36.434 --> 00:54:40.856]  We're averaging about 300 mass shootings a year.
[00:54:40.856 --> 00:54:42.437]  No other country comes close.
[00:54:42.437 --> 00:54:43.517]  So, yes, this is f***ed up.
[00:54:43.517 --> 00:54:44.218]  It's not true.
[00:54:44.218 --> 00:54:54.322]  And if we don't call it out for what it is, if we're not able to speak clearly, if we're not able to speak decisively, then we will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America.
[00:54:54.322 --> 00:54:55.563]  And I cannot accept that.
[00:54:55.563 --> 00:55:01.125]  And so we're going to speak as defiantly and as strongly as we can, but we're also going to take action.
[00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:12.093]  Universal background checks, red flag laws, an end to the sales of weapons of war, and buying those AK-47s and AR-15s back so that they cannot be used against our fellow Americans.
[00:55:12.093 --> 00:55:13.794]  And oh, just take the AK-47s.
[00:55:13.794 --> 00:55:14.895]  AK-47s full auto.
[00:55:14.895 --> 00:55:16.396]  You can't even get that without a special deal.
[00:55:16.396 --> 00:55:17.397]  That's not even true.
[00:55:17.397 --> 00:55:19.258]  Full autos are never even used in crimes.
[00:55:19.258 --> 00:55:20.219]  He knows all that.
[00:55:20.219 --> 00:55:21.600]  But he's manipulating people.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:25.563]  By the way, there are lots of countries that have millions killed routinely.
[00:55:25.563 --> 00:55:27.965]  It's just, oh, the government has the guns, they're doing the killing.
[00:55:27.965 --> 00:55:30.307]  Yeah, we're one of the only countries that has guns, jackass!
[00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:34.229]  Like Switzerland has the lowest crime rate in the world.
[00:55:34.229 --> 00:55:37.412]  That's why you can't go take control of it, you big, fat, dirty parasite.
[00:55:37.412 --> 00:55:38.773]  Beto the loser.
[00:55:38.773 --> 00:55:39.493]  O'Rourke.
[00:55:39.493 --> 00:55:40.614]  We'll be back with Critical Intel.
[00:55:40.614 --> 00:55:41.675]  Stay with us.
[00:55:47.817 --> 00:55:49.018]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[00:55:49.018 --> 00:55:52.381]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[00:55:52.381 --> 00:55:53.622]  But it's very exciting.
[00:55:53.622 --> 00:55:55.943]  It's Super Silver Skin Cream.
[00:55:55.943 --> 00:55:57.465]  It's got all of these benefits.
[00:55:57.465 --> 00:55:58.545]  Too many to mention.
[00:55:58.545 --> 00:55:59.827]  But it's revolutionary.
[00:55:59.827 --> 00:56:00.767]  It's brand new.
[00:56:00.767 --> 00:56:01.608]  People are going to love it.
[00:56:01.608 --> 00:56:03.750]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream.

[00:56:06.852 --> 00:56:09.314]  Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[00:56:09.314 --> 00:56:11.556]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[00:56:11.556 --> 00:56:15.419]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[00:56:15.419 --> 00:56:20.464]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.

[00:56:31.573 --> 00:56:33.575]  It's got the highly sought-after hyaluronic
[00:56:33.735 --> 00:56:35.436]  This is Greg Reese for InfoWars.com in Hong Kong.
[00:56:35.436 --> 00:56:37.056]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement.
[00:57:03.527 --> 00:57:04.649]  We're good to go.
[00:57:19.131 --> 00:57:22.714]  Millie Weaver and Kaitlin Bennett in the American heartland.
[00:57:22.714 --> 00:57:29.880]  And from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.603]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.
[00:57:33.603 --> 00:57:35.044]  We have to keep winning!

[00:57:47.701 --> 00:57:53.128]  Super Mel Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[00:57:53.849 --> 00:58:01.996]  It is a award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[00:58:01.996 --> 00:58:03.277]  It is cold-pressed.
[00:58:03.277 --> 00:58:09.703]  It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[00:58:09.703 --> 00:58:10.884]  It's not boiled.
[00:58:10.884 --> 00:58:11.684]  It's not heated.
[00:58:11.684 --> 00:58:12.845]  It's never been dried.
[00:58:12.845 --> 00:58:15.368]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[00:58:15.368 --> 00:58:18.070]  That's why it's so strong.
[00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:21.473]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.
[00:58:21.813 --> 00:58:35.806]  And I'm so excited about Super Mel Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you, with every order of Super Mel Vitality, a 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.

[00:58:47.376 --> 00:58:48.396]  Josh in Washington.
[00:58:48.396 --> 00:58:48.937]  You're on the air.
[00:58:48.937 --> 00:58:49.477]  Go ahead.
[00:58:49.477 --> 00:58:50.797]  Alex, God bless you.
[00:58:50.797 --> 00:58:53.238]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:58:53.238 --> 00:58:59.181]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[00:58:59.181 --> 00:58:59.861]  Ooh, yeah.
[00:58:59.861 --> 00:59:01.222]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[00:59:01.222 --> 00:59:03.082]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[00:59:03.082 --> 00:59:04.123]  Totally changed my life.
[00:59:04.123 --> 00:59:07.164]  I use TurboForce, BODY, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[00:59:07.364 --> 00:59:07.745]  We're good.
[00:59:22.661 --> 00:59:25.002]  All of these things are known to be incredible.
[00:59:25.002 --> 00:59:31.763]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[00:59:31.763 --> 00:59:34.323]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body.
[00:59:34.323 --> 00:59:37.444]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[00:59:37.444 --> 00:59:39.224]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[00:59:39.224 --> 00:59:43.205]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[00:59:43.205 --> 00:59:45.966]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[00:59:45.966 --> 00:59:46.726]  Thank you so much.
[00:59:46.726 --> 00:59:47.246]  God bless you.
[00:59:50.074 --> 00:59:52.795]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:52.795 --> 01:00:10.781]  A little Lana Del Rey for you, folks.
[01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:17.803]  There's a lot of really selfish people out there.
[01:00:21.844 --> 01:00:28.308]  You know, suicide's always been a problem with humanity.
[01:00:28.308 --> 01:00:38.875]  But, it's also been known that a lot of evil people, when they go, they want to take people with them.
[01:00:38.875 --> 01:00:48.682]  And the fact that we are seeing an uptick in stabbings, and stranglings, and people literally trying to chew the flesh off folks' face,
[01:00:51.249 --> 01:00:56.271]  Shows that we've lost our soul to a certain extent.
[01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:58.112]  Shows that we're sliding towards the abyss.
[01:00:58.112 --> 01:01:00.553]  We've lost our moral compass.
[01:01:00.553 --> 01:01:15.099]  And then you look at these chemicals, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the so-called antidepressants, they say on the bottles and with the inserts that this tends to massively increase megalomania.
[01:01:15.099 --> 01:01:18.580]  It tends to massively increase psychotic behavior.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.321]  It tends to massively increase
[01:01:21.297 --> 01:01:23.379]  Going out and committing murder.
[01:01:23.379 --> 01:01:30.124]  It actually says, may cause mass murder.
[01:01:30.124 --> 01:01:41.752]  But when you see the ads for antidepressants that something like 30% of the population's on, 30% of women are on them, something like 15% of men.
[01:01:41.752 --> 01:01:44.774]  Yeah.
[01:01:44.774 --> 01:01:48.057]  They don't tell you all that.
[01:01:48.057 --> 01:01:49.638]  I know a very well-known musician
[01:01:54.394 --> 01:01:59.497]  Who I met through Mike Judge, who's an incredible musician in his own right.
[01:01:59.497 --> 01:02:01.498]  Not name dropping, just to give you an idea.
[01:02:01.498 --> 01:02:10.544]  And he has that disease that Michael Jackson had where your skin turns totally white.
[01:02:10.544 --> 01:02:15.967]  From the antidepressant he takes.
[01:02:15.967 --> 01:02:19.449]  He's got all these other health problems.
[01:02:19.449 --> 01:02:22.351]  He hadn't had any of it until he took the pills and they admit
[01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:33.264]  Within two years of him taking those pills, he looks like a vampire and he's got all these other health problems and he can't go off of it or he wants to kill himself.
[01:02:33.264 --> 01:02:43.310]  And he didn't go on it because he wanted to kill himself before, he just went on it because they just recommended it to him.
[01:02:43.310 --> 01:02:52.195]  And then you got enough fentanyl being captured at the border last week to kill 14 million people.
[01:02:54.261 --> 01:03:08.353]  There's a story behind that, and I'll get to that in a moment, but just remember, they are prescribing ten times the opioids that they were putting out just five years ago.
[01:03:08.353 --> 01:03:10.355]  That's a DEA number.
[01:03:10.355 --> 01:03:16.160]  Ten times the number of scripts these doctors are writing.
[01:03:17.697 --> 01:03:21.960]  And look, I get some people are in real pain and need the moderate opioids.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.463]  I know some of you out there, you'll get them taken away from you.
[01:03:26.463 --> 01:03:30.886]  But then other people are killing themselves with it.
[01:03:30.886 --> 01:03:32.547]  But think about that.
[01:03:32.547 --> 01:03:38.671]  Fentanyl is a hundred times stronger than opium.
[01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:41.573]  They debate that ten times stronger than heroin, some say even stronger than that.
[01:03:47.369 --> 01:03:57.657]  Developing powers, the European powers divided China into seven parts, 12 parts, 14 parts at one point.
[01:03:57.657 --> 01:04:00.539]  You had the American zone, the French zone, the British zone.
[01:04:00.539 --> 01:04:03.061]  It was obviously the coastline, the most valuable.
[01:04:03.061 --> 01:04:09.306]  And they took over from the Imperial Chinese, because the Chinese said opium's illegal here.
[01:04:09.306 --> 01:04:11.168]  We'll kill you if you have it.
[01:04:11.168 --> 01:04:16.532]  But that created a black market, so that the British would bring it in and first corrupt the coastlines,
[01:04:17.844 --> 01:04:22.687]  That the police corrupt would ship it inland, and then you had all the Chinese laid out, smoking their opium.
[01:04:22.687 --> 01:04:30.352]  When they would come over here to America, they would just work all day on the railroad, and lay out and take their head of opium in the opium dens.
[01:04:30.352 --> 01:04:39.739]  And there's estimated over a million and a half buried Chinese men that just came here for opium.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:43.141]  And work themselves to death like slaves.
[01:04:43.141 --> 01:04:47.862]  One true thing about that show Deadwood, it's based on a real town that HBO had, you know, years ago.
[01:04:47.862 --> 01:04:48.283]  I watched it.
[01:04:48.283 --> 01:04:49.083]  It was actually accurate.
[01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:52.364]  That's a real town that really... Well, most of that's historical.
[01:04:52.364 --> 01:04:53.604]  Some of it's not.
[01:04:53.604 --> 01:04:56.085]  Where they had the Chinese women having to service like 50 men a day.
[01:04:56.085 --> 01:05:03.468]  And when one of them got pregnant or got sick, they'd just feed them to pigs.
[01:05:03.468 --> 01:05:05.449]  That's the kind of human rights you got in China.
[01:05:05.449 --> 01:05:09.410]  And once it came over here, that's the type of human rights you have.
[01:05:10.919 --> 01:05:15.061]  And so that's what we're competing with, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:17.062]  So the communists came along and just took all that over.
[01:05:17.062 --> 01:05:20.844]  So the Chinese now will execute you.
[01:05:20.844 --> 01:05:22.585]  Death penalty for any drugs.
[01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.006]  Marijuana, death penalty.
[01:05:24.006 --> 01:05:24.967]  Opium, death penalty.
[01:05:24.967 --> 01:05:28.409]  Same thing in Singapore.
[01:05:28.409 --> 01:05:35.953]  But they're shipping in illegal fentanyl and killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.
[01:05:36.957 --> 01:05:42.960]  The latest numbers are 2017, 53,000 people die from opiates.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.682]  They think less than half ever get properly reported.
[01:05:45.682 --> 01:05:48.203]  So back then it was 100,000, let's say.
[01:05:48.203 --> 01:05:49.844]  Now they're saying it's 10 times the amount.
[01:05:49.844 --> 01:05:51.545]  They don't know the numbers of death.
[01:05:51.545 --> 01:05:54.307]  It's just epidemic.
[01:05:54.307 --> 01:05:55.187]  How many movie stars?
[01:05:55.187 --> 01:05:57.369]  How many baseball players?
[01:05:57.369 --> 01:05:59.310]  Every week you hear about somebody dying is famous.
[01:06:00.643 --> 01:06:01.884]  Does anybody care about that?
[01:06:01.884 --> 01:06:03.145]  Yeah, President Trump does.
[01:06:03.145 --> 01:06:05.506]  And I'm not just here giving President Trump a brownie point.
[01:06:05.506 --> 01:06:13.571]  He's actually going after something that's killing people.
[01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:16.252]  He's actually doing something real, not just lip service.
[01:06:16.252 --> 01:06:25.738]  Because, okay, a hundred and whatever plus people die a year in true mass shootings.
[01:06:25.738 --> 01:06:28.520]  Or somebody goes out to try to
[01:06:30.697 --> 01:06:32.478]  Kill a bunch of people for no reason.
[01:06:32.478 --> 01:06:38.119]  When Beto says there's over 300 mass shootings a year, most of those are gang-related, where you get three or four gang members shot.
[01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:45.322]  And that's still terrible, too, but that doesn't stand any comparison to all the other things we can do something about.
[01:06:45.322 --> 01:06:48.163]  Enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people?
[01:06:48.163 --> 01:06:49.283]  We'll play that report in a moment.
[01:06:49.283 --> 01:06:54.025]  But first, here's Beto O'Rourke, slowed down for radio and TV viewers a month ago.
[01:06:54.025 --> 01:06:58.286]  Couldn't contain his sickening, demonic laughing when he talked about
[01:07:00.131 --> 01:07:05.235]  The psychotic antifa that went into that Walmart at that mall in El Paso.
[01:07:05.235 --> 01:07:06.476]  Here it is.
[01:07:06.476 --> 01:07:13.501]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:17.003]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[01:07:23.794 --> 01:07:29.735]  But I'll tell you, El Paso is the strongest place in the world.
[01:07:29.735 --> 01:07:40.517]  There's a lot of injury, a lot of suffering in El Paso right now.
[01:07:40.517 --> 01:07:42.337]  I'm incredibly saddened.
[01:07:42.337 --> 01:07:44.098]  It's very hard to think about this.
[01:07:44.098 --> 01:07:46.678]  And then he starts laughing.
[01:07:46.678 --> 01:07:49.619]  I thought we'd slow that clip down, but tomorrow I'll slow it down.
[01:07:49.619 --> 01:07:51.159]  I'm going to be here live now.
[01:07:51.159 --> 01:07:51.899]  I'm coming in tomorrow.
[01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:55.091]  And I'm going to do, you know, four hours here at least.
[01:07:55.091 --> 01:07:57.293]  I may even do war room too, just because everybody deserves some time off.
[01:07:57.293 --> 01:08:00.917]  In fact, we'll just have a skeleton crew who wants to come and volunteer, because I'm going to be here.
[01:08:00.917 --> 01:08:02.098]  Because we've got to fight, folks.
[01:08:02.098 --> 01:08:03.780]  We just can't give up here.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:07.423]  We're going to go out to break with this CBS News report.
[01:08:07.423 --> 01:08:14.771]  Enough fentanyl seized coming into the United States, what they call a land port.
[01:08:16.067 --> 01:08:19.370]  It's Mexico, but they don't want to land port into the U.S.
[01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:20.230]  It's coming to the U.S.
[01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:22.572]  bound to kill 14 million people.
[01:08:22.572 --> 01:08:23.954]  Enough to kill 14 million people.
[01:08:23.954 --> 01:08:24.234]  Here it is.
[01:08:25.427 --> 01:08:29.230]  Investigators have busted a massive drug ring spanning three states.
[01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:31.172]  All this over just the last three days.
[01:08:31.172 --> 01:08:39.058]  Law enforcement officers in Virginia seized enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people as part of what they're calling Operation Cookout.
[01:08:39.058 --> 01:08:43.542]  There are 35 suspects that have been arrested, four others still on the run.
[01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:45.083]  Chip Reid is in Washington for us.
[01:08:45.083 --> 01:08:47.985]  Chip, what else did investigators seize in this bust?
[01:08:47.985 --> 01:08:48.366]  Good morning.
[01:08:48.886 --> 01:08:57.040]  Well, authorities say they seized about 66 pounds of fentanyl in addition to other illegal drugs and money amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.186]  But the fentanyl, which is a synthetic opioid, had them especially concerned.
[01:09:02.421 --> 01:09:06.326]  This opioid crisis is not an issue that's happening someplace else or to someone else.
[01:09:06.326 --> 01:09:07.988]  It's happening right here in Norfolk.
[01:09:07.988 --> 01:09:13.534]  Announcing the largest drug takedown in Virginia in 15 years, G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S.
[01:09:13.534 --> 01:09:18.620]  Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said most fentanyl comes from Chinese labs.
[01:09:19.241 --> 01:09:29.224]  In total, authorities seized over 30 kilograms of fentanyl, 30 kilograms of heroin, 5 kilograms of cocaine, and over $700,000 in cash.
[01:09:29.224 --> 01:09:33.686]  They also seized roughly 24 firearms, including an AK-47.
[01:09:33.686 --> 01:09:37.087]  We're not talking about $500 and $600 deals.
[01:09:37.087 --> 01:09:39.728]  We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:09:39.728 --> 01:09:44.730]  You know, $20,000 in the trunk of somebody's car, in a gym bag, you know, behind... Alright, go ahead and paint this down.
[01:09:45.959 --> 01:09:47.800]  Now, I want to come back from break.
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:52.964]  It's been a year since InfoWars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[01:09:52.964 --> 01:10:00.890]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned, and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:08.875]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.
[01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:09.916]  And it's now here.
[01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:11.097]  Banned.video.
[01:10:11.657 --> 01:10:26.223]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.

[01:11:30.136 --> 01:11:30.536]  So again,
[01:11:31.096 --> 01:11:36.723]  We are running this special as long as our stock of Carnivore 90 is still here.

[01:11:49.216 --> 01:11:50.377]  Alex, God bless you.
[01:11:50.377 --> 01:11:52.959]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[01:11:52.959 --> 01:11:58.924]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[01:11:58.924 --> 01:11:59.585]  Ooh, yeah.
[01:11:59.585 --> 01:12:00.946]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[01:12:00.946 --> 01:12:02.807]  Gonna have some comments on your supplements, man.
[01:12:02.807 --> 01:12:03.848]  Totally changed my life.
[01:12:03.848 --> 01:12:06.891]  I use TurboForce, BODY, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[01:12:07.091 --> 01:12:08.012]  We're good to go.
[01:12:22.368 --> 01:12:24.730]  All of these things are known to be incredible.
[01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:31.514]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:34.036]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel in the body.
[01:12:34.036 --> 01:12:37.198]  You take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[01:12:37.198 --> 01:12:38.959]  Now you can build the big strong temple.
[01:12:38.959 --> 01:12:42.922]  With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[01:12:42.922 --> 01:12:45.704]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[01:12:45.704 --> 01:12:46.445]  Thank you so much.
[01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:46.985]  God bless you.
[01:12:47.205 --> 01:12:51.068]  In InfoWars life, we always try to bring you game-changing products.
[01:12:51.068 --> 01:12:55.552]  Now, we've already been promoting and selling Super Silver Wound Gel for over a year.
[01:12:55.552 --> 01:12:56.593]  It's a bestseller.
[01:12:56.593 --> 01:12:58.515]  It is the best you can get.
[01:12:58.515 --> 01:13:01.397]  A 100% review rate on Power Reviews.
[01:13:01.397 --> 01:13:05.261]  Well, now we teamed up with them and came out with two different types of
[01:13:05.521 --> 01:13:05.881]  Of course!
[01:13:21.511 --> 01:13:21.931]  Of course!
[01:13:50.072 --> 01:14:03.604]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:14:03.604 --> 01:14:06.146]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:14:06.146 --> 01:14:08.929]  It's time for you to choose a side.
[01:14:08.929 --> 01:14:12.031]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:14:12.031 --> 01:14:14.734]  Okay, so there's so much fentanyl in this country.
[01:14:16.101 --> 01:14:24.665]  That earlier today, I just sent a link into the producers and said, hey, look at the 25 tons of fentanyl seized coming into Mexico bound to the U.S.
[01:14:24.665 --> 01:14:29.827]  And somehow they just got a clip out of Virginia where they're calling it a record seizure.
[01:14:29.827 --> 01:14:33.268]  You know, a few pounds of it can kill 14 million people.
[01:14:33.268 --> 01:14:39.391]  OK, and I'm glad we had this hiccup today because it's really illustrative.
[01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:42.112]  A couple pounds of it.
[01:14:42.112 --> 01:14:43.592]  Can kill 20.
[01:14:43.592 --> 01:14:45.033]  I can kill 14 million people.
[01:14:46.694 --> 01:14:49.277]  14 million people.
[01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:56.606]  What does 25 tons of pure fentanyl grabbed by the Mexican Navy bound to the U.S.
[01:14:56.606 --> 01:14:59.289]  do?
[01:14:59.289 --> 01:15:04.635]  And we're rolling footage for TV viewers of where this barely got a mention in the U.S.
[01:15:04.635 --> 01:15:05.516]  news a week ago.
[01:15:07.762 --> 01:15:33.673]  That's CGTV, the Mexican Navy seizes six tons at one spot, and in all the raids, it was 25 tons of ships, boats, offshore Chinese trawlers, loading it on to motorboats, and bringing it in to Mexico, to then be loaded on 18 wheelers and taken to the United States.
[01:15:33.673 --> 01:15:36.555]  So, understand, one of those little boxes
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:41.681]  is more than the DEA is making a big deal about in Virginia.
[01:15:41.681 --> 01:15:45.402]  They could kill 14 million people if it was overdosed.
[01:15:45.402 --> 01:15:48.163]  There's enough overdoses for 14 million people.
[01:15:48.163 --> 01:15:54.125]  This stuff's so strong before it's been cut that a single speck of it will kill you.
[01:15:54.125 --> 01:16:00.787]  Meanwhile, 25 tons got grabbed in different busts last week.
[01:16:00.787 --> 01:16:05.389]  And then you just type in fentanyl, DEA, more than 1 million fentanyl pills.
[01:16:05.389 --> 01:16:06.469]  Season, Arizona.
[01:16:11.496 --> 01:16:20.724]  More than 23,000 kilograms of Chinese fentanyl seized at Mexico's largest seaport.
[01:16:20.724 --> 01:16:22.905]  And that's a whole nother one!
[01:16:22.905 --> 01:16:30.552]  So, you're beginning to get the idea here, China has a very long memory, and they remember the British particularly.
[01:16:31.394 --> 01:16:34.256]  And that's how Skull and Bones made its money at Yale.
[01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:38.219]  The guy that founded it was the big opium distributor into the United States as well.
[01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:41.921]  I mean, hell, they used to sell laudanum to women, men, children.
[01:16:41.921 --> 01:16:46.904]  You ever go out in the countryside, you'll find an old dump, there'll be hundreds of bottles that say laudanum.
[01:16:46.904 --> 01:16:49.506]  As your baby was crying, you just gave him some laudanum.
[01:16:49.506 --> 01:16:51.187]  They were happy for five, six hours.
[01:16:51.187 --> 01:16:52.268]  Because it was opium!
[01:16:53.626 --> 01:16:57.109]  But the Chinese, you see, they execute you.
[01:16:57.109 --> 01:17:09.560]  If you get caught with one opium pill, much less fentanyl, if you get caught with one marijuana, cigarette, then you get executed.
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:15.126]  But they ship it all here and they make most of our drugs in China.
[01:17:16.192 --> 01:17:27.040]  And they're spiking everything, and they're finding toxic waste in the over-the-counter pills you get, and they're finding plastic in most of the food that's shipped in from China.
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:32.784]  They are just pissing in our Cheerios with poison!
[01:17:32.784 --> 01:17:43.392]  And they're funding Netflix and Hollywood with all the anti-American race war movies, and trying to demoralize us constantly!
[01:17:47.426 --> 01:17:50.407]  It's incredible.
[01:17:50.407 --> 01:17:55.328]  And they know what they're doing.
[01:17:55.328 --> 01:17:58.489]  And again, they've killed 115 million of their own people.
[01:17:58.489 --> 01:18:01.050]  But they are really getting us back.
[01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:07.012]  Even though the United States really doesn't have any history of shipping opium in, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:07.012 --> 01:18:09.373]  We're still seen as a competitor to them.
[01:18:09.373 --> 01:18:10.513]  We're still seen as their enemy.
[01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:15.954]  And so, Japan bombed our ships in a sneak attack.
[01:18:15.954 --> 01:18:18.636]  They bombed military men and women.
[01:18:18.636 --> 01:18:20.518]  Mainly men at that time.
[01:18:20.518 --> 01:18:22.760]  They killed some women as well.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.743]  And it was seen as dastardly because it was a sneak attack.
[01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:30.127]  That's, in the age of war at that time, was normal.
[01:18:30.127 --> 01:18:30.828]  Not a good thing.
[01:18:30.828 --> 01:18:32.830]  I'm not defending it.
[01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:36.153]  But the Chinese communists are shipping
[01:18:39.428 --> 01:18:45.613]  Let's pull up, what's the estimated amount of fentanyl, type in, estimated amount of fentanyl shipped in the U.S.
[01:18:45.613 --> 01:18:47.235]  annually?
[01:18:47.235 --> 01:18:47.575]  Is it 100 tons?
[01:18:47.575 --> 01:18:49.517]  Is it 200 tons?
[01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:49.997]  Is it 300 tons?
[01:18:49.997 --> 01:18:51.979]  Is it 400 tons?
[01:18:51.979 --> 01:18:55.382]  I mean, they just caught 25 tons coming in last week.
[01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.460]  And I could talk all day.
[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:08.462]  I've got so much other news.
[01:19:08.462 --> 01:19:13.284]  But see, I've been harping on this, haven't I?
[01:19:13.284 --> 01:19:14.365]  Because let me show you the numbers.
[01:19:14.365 --> 01:19:15.285]  I mentioned this earlier.
[01:19:15.285 --> 01:19:25.671]  I've got the federal government's own numbers right here in my stack about the numbers here.
[01:19:25.671 --> 01:19:26.672]  The latest numbers we have is 2017.
[01:19:32.233 --> 01:19:34.094]  And it says here it's 53,000.
[01:19:34.094 --> 01:19:37.256]  That graph we showed said 47,000.
[01:19:37.256 --> 01:19:38.376]  Let me show you this.
[01:19:38.376 --> 01:19:39.297]  Can I have an overhead shot?
[01:19:39.297 --> 01:19:40.237]  Thanks a lot.
[01:19:40.237 --> 01:19:42.458]  Here.
[01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:42.878]  Opioid.
[01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:46.900]  This is from the American Society of Addiction Medicine.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.661]  They say 52,404.
[01:19:47.661 --> 01:19:48.361]  So I said 53.
[01:19:48.361 --> 01:19:51.763]  I was going from memory.
[01:19:51.763 --> 01:19:52.323]  And that was in 2017.
[01:19:52.323 --> 01:19:55.905]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:19:55.905 --> 01:19:56.725]  That number's even older.
[01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:58.266]  That's 2015.
[01:19:58.266 --> 01:20:00.047]  And they say it's up tenfold.
[01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:07.628]  So whether it's 47,000 or 53,000, whoever's right, that's a lot of people.
[01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:10.489]  And most people that die in overdoses, it never gets reported right.
[01:20:10.489 --> 01:20:19.873]  So if it's 10 times that amount coming in right now, and they just seized 25 tons of it, but a couple pounds of it, can we queue that Virginia News piece up again?
[01:20:19.873 --> 01:20:22.575]  Thanks.
[01:20:22.575 --> 01:20:27.997]  If a small amount of it, I forget exactly how much they said, we'll play it again, would kill 14 million people,
[01:20:31.613 --> 01:20:34.695]  Because the numbers I've seen is a hundred times stronger than heroin.
[01:20:34.695 --> 01:20:38.898]  And then I see a hundred times stronger than opium, and heroin's a lot stronger than opium, so I don't know.
[01:20:38.898 --> 01:20:46.863]  Let's just say this, this stuff makes Oxycontin look like beer compared to Everclear, compared to white lightning.
[01:20:46.863 --> 01:20:51.907]  And there are people like zombies all over the place, totally addicted to this stuff.
[01:20:51.907 --> 01:20:57.270]  And the Chinese are doing it, and Trump's trying to fight it, and he's the bad guy.
[01:20:57.270 --> 01:21:01.193]  Just remember, the Federal Reserve's private, owned by Europe, trying to crash our economy.
[01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:06.151]  All these big media outlets are trying to bankrupt us, trying to get us shut down.
[01:21:06.151 --> 01:21:11.132]  All these big Democrat law firms are suing us because they want to continue hammering America.
[01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:13.813]  Because this is 21st century warfare.
[01:21:13.813 --> 01:21:17.134]  And everybody siding with the globalists is part of this.
[01:21:17.134 --> 01:21:23.055]  So again, here's that newscast out of Virginia, making a big deal out of a small amount being found.
[01:21:23.055 --> 01:21:26.957]  So if this small amount kills 14 million, what's 25 tons?
[01:21:26.957 --> 01:21:27.917]  Here it is.
[01:21:29.321 --> 01:21:35.064]  Investigators have busted a massive drug ring spanning three states, all this over just the last three days.
[01:21:35.064 --> 01:21:42.928]  Law enforcement officers in Virginia seized enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people as part of what they're calling Operation Cookout.
[01:21:42.928 --> 01:21:47.430]  There are 35 suspects that have been arrested, four others still on the run.
[01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:48.971]  Chip Reid is in Washington for us.
[01:21:48.971 --> 01:21:51.872]  Chip, what else did investigators seize in this bust?
[01:21:51.872 --> 01:21:52.793]  Good morning.
[01:21:52.793 --> 01:21:56.094]  Well, authorities say they seized about 66 pounds of fentanyl.
[01:21:56.094 --> 01:21:56.915]  Okay, hit pause.
[01:21:58.015 --> 01:22:00.617]  I'm so flustered today, I heard pounds.
[01:22:00.617 --> 01:22:02.479]  So that's why.
[01:22:02.479 --> 01:22:05.461]  I'm so flustered today, my normal trick memory's gone out the window.
[01:22:05.461 --> 01:22:06.622]  So I said, play it again.
[01:22:06.622 --> 01:22:11.706]  So let's, we'll do the calculator thing tomorrow when I start the show.
[01:22:11.706 --> 01:22:18.552]  66 pounds, or whatever, divided into 25 tons, how much smaller is that?
[01:22:18.552 --> 01:22:20.133]  What fraction is it?
[01:22:20.133 --> 01:22:23.756]  So that's gonna kill 14 million, if it was taken in an overdose amount.
[01:22:25.216 --> 01:22:25.836]  What's 25 tons?
[01:22:25.836 --> 01:22:27.878]  Is that enough to kill the whole country?
[01:22:27.878 --> 01:22:31.480]  If it was all taken?
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.320]  330 million people?
[01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:34.922]  If we all took it?
[01:22:34.922 --> 01:22:35.822]  As an overdose?
[01:22:35.822 --> 01:22:38.204]  Is that enough to give us all an overdose and kill the whole country?
[01:22:38.204 --> 01:22:42.426]  Is that our headline?
[01:22:42.426 --> 01:22:47.169]  China tried to ship enough fentanyl into the United States to kill everybody in the U.S.?
[01:22:47.169 --> 01:22:49.310]  I don't have a calculator in front of me.
[01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:50.531]  I guess I could do it by hand.
[01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:53.531]  But that's crazy.
[01:22:53.531 --> 01:23:06.843]  Yeah, so 66 pounds, 66 pounds is .0013, according to my producers, of 25 tons.
[01:23:06.843 --> 01:23:13.229]  So we have to find out how much more 25 tons is to that, and then apply the number.
[01:23:13.229 --> 01:23:14.750]  So if 14 million is .0013,
[01:23:18.154 --> 01:23:19.216]  What with 25 tons?
[01:23:19.216 --> 01:23:22.321]  I think that could kill the whole country.
[01:23:22.321 --> 01:23:23.402]  I'm not a mathematician.
[01:23:23.402 --> 01:23:24.844]  I'll get that done tonight.
[01:23:24.844 --> 01:23:26.747]  First thing tomorrow, you'll hear from us.
[01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:37.425]  Okay, I didn't get to mainstream news telling you that Apple and Google and all the companies are watching and listening to you and selling your data and listening to you have sex and everything.
[01:23:37.425 --> 01:23:43.228]  They're only telling you now because they want to normalize it to move forward as this is the new economy.
[01:23:43.228 --> 01:23:45.849]  But that's the front page of Yahoo.
[01:23:45.849 --> 01:23:47.149]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:48.330]  It's up on DreadReport.com.
[01:23:48.330 --> 01:23:51.131]  We'll explain why they're throwing it in your face now when we told you.
[01:23:54.343 --> 01:24:01.724]  We told you in 2004 with articles and covered it in detail with the actual documents, so that's... No mathematician, but how many years ago is that?
[01:24:03.768 --> 01:24:04.249]  17 years ago?
[01:24:04.249 --> 01:24:05.949]  16 years ago?
[01:24:05.949 --> 01:24:08.311]  Because we're the bad guys.
[01:24:08.311 --> 01:24:10.952]  Remember, we're the Infowars, it's the bad guys.
[01:24:10.952 --> 01:24:12.293]  Don't tell anybody about this show.
[01:24:12.293 --> 01:24:13.934]  Don't tune in.
[01:24:13.934 --> 01:24:17.535]  The 25 tons of fentanyl is not the problem enough to kill the whole country, assuredly.
[01:24:17.535 --> 01:24:17.876]  No, no, no.
[01:24:17.876 --> 01:24:20.777]  The problem is that you own guns that can protect yourself.
[01:24:20.777 --> 01:24:21.738]  You're bad.
[01:24:21.738 --> 01:24:26.500]  And the same folks that want Trump to not stop the fentanyl, they want your guns because they want you out of the way.
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.101]  They want to conquer you and dominate you.
[01:24:28.806 --> 01:24:29.768]  Thank you all for tuning in.
[01:24:29.768 --> 01:24:31.611]  Lord willing, I'll be on tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:24:31.611 --> 01:24:32.173]  Central.
[01:24:32.173 --> 01:24:33.736]  I'm gonna try my best to be live.
[01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:34.257]  I will be here.
