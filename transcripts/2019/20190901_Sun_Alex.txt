[00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:20.651]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:32.438]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.653]  Yeah.
[00:02:34.912 --> 00:02:43.279]  Mason Perulli developed brain cancer.
[00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.562]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:58.532]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[00:02:58.812 --> 00:03:18.070]  So think about how the LA Times, even Wired Magazine, will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves, cell phones operate as microwave transmitters and receivers.
[00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.931]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.072]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[00:03:22.212 --> 00:03:27.115]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:32.299]  That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.979]  You heard me right.
[00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.761]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:42.083]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[00:03:42.603 --> 00:03:55.646]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:57.707]  What may have happened here?
[00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.889]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:07.932]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:17.417]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:20.739]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.580]  People won't listen to me because I got too much depth?
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.841]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:26.443]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:04:26.943 --> 00:04:27.564]  Years ago.
[00:04:27.584 --> 00:04:35.470]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.551]  He was talking about this years ago.
[00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:39.273]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:04:48.134 --> 00:04:51.178]  Start your engines, and get ready.
[00:04:51.198 --> 00:04:58.349]  Cause this is gonna be one hell of a transmission to remember.
[00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:59.951]  It's Thursday, August 29th, 2019.
[00:05:03.777 --> 00:05:07.440]  Banned.video is the answer to censorship.
[00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:23.173]  Banned.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available.
[00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:25.094]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:26.195]  It's now live.
[00:05:26.736 --> 00:05:28.417]  Banned.video.
[00:05:28.677 --> 00:05:31.920]  Banned.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex
[00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:53.495]  We're building it to be a place where banned memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chi-coms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalists.
[00:05:53.735 --> 00:05:55.796]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:55.836 --> 00:06:04.041]  You have gone to Infowarsstore.com and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need.
[00:06:15.628 --> 00:06:17.729]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:19.690]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.454 --> 00:06:31.075]  So we should do what any other country does by dealing with this situation in a serious way.
[00:06:31.115 --> 00:06:36.956]  So we have to bring in the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees.
[00:06:52.938 --> 00:07:02.365]  An agency that has the expertise and the training to handle massive flows of refugees.
[00:07:06.067 --> 00:07:17.115]  Now, I got sent that clip seven or eight times in the last 12 hours.
[00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:20.438]  I got sent some late last night, some today by friends, family, you name it.
[00:07:21.483 --> 00:07:27.388]  And Paul Joseph Watson is putting a big article together for InfoWars.com that gives you the rest of the backstory.
[00:07:27.428 --> 00:07:28.349]  But you heard what she said.
[00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:33.753]  She said we should do what every other country does.
[00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:40.939]  We should have the United Nations run our borders and run the refugee crisis.
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:48.605]  Now when she says that, she's giving you the establishment goal of the United Nations.
[00:07:49.775 --> 00:08:04.505]  The United Nations Refugee Office, the treaties that most nations are signatories to, puts the UN in control, not just of your borders, but of the policies and of who you accept into your country.
[00:08:06.006 --> 00:08:09.568]  So I'm getting all these calls saying, Alex, it's incredible, you were right again.
[00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:12.731]  They say they want the UN to run our borders.
[00:08:39.075 --> 00:08:53.985]  The zombie apocalypse is real.
[00:08:55.086 --> 00:08:56.086]  It's happening right now.
[00:08:57.607 --> 00:09:01.650]  It's taking place in a delayed, slow motion fashion.
[00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:04.672]  And it's been designed that way.
[00:09:06.072 --> 00:09:10.394]  We're witnessing the controlled demolition of civilization.
[00:09:25.579 --> 00:09:26.339]  InfoWars.
[00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.240]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:09:31.306 --> 00:09:36.250]  I am going to lay out the four reasons this is happening and how we can stop it.
[00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:51.483]  But first, I want to show you three recent examples of senseless, psychotic crime being committed on the streets of America in just the last few days.
[00:09:53.021 --> 00:10:12.120]  Just days ago in Florida, a 16-year-old brutally murdered his sister and her young daughter before chasing police around a field completely naked, running up to a greenskeeper and demonically grabbing him and humping him and reportedly chanting satanic statements.
[00:10:13.453 --> 00:10:14.274]  What's causing this?
[00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:15.915]  We're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:10:16.495 --> 00:10:28.405]  Throughout history, in every oral and written tradition, every culture talks about times when the population begins to go crazy, and to psychotically kill each other, and to even eat each other.
[00:10:29.165 --> 00:10:32.488]  The ancient Romans talked about it, the ancient Greeks, the ancient Chinese.
[00:10:32.528 --> 00:10:33.889]  There's African fables.
[00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:42.697]  There, of course, are the Native American legends of these nightwalkers that would go out and grab humans and kill them.
[00:10:43.178 --> 00:10:46.581]  And, of course, they themselves were humans that, again, had gone crazy.
[00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:50.104]  All of these legends have a basis in truth.
[00:10:55.971 --> 00:11:02.493]  And did you know that the Pentagon is publicly training for what they call a zombie apocalypse?
[00:11:02.893 --> 00:11:04.014]  We'll get to that again in a moment.
[00:11:04.534 --> 00:11:07.235]  But first, here's another horrific example.
[00:11:08.035 --> 00:11:16.158]  In Atlanta, Georgia, just two nights ago, an Uber driver was summoned to a woman behaving just like a zombie out of a movie.
[00:11:16.518 --> 00:11:19.019]  She attacks his car, tries to go through the windshield.
[00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:20.860]  Then tries to steal the car.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.401]  When he tries to stop her, she starts biting him and latches on like a pit bull.
[00:11:25.842 --> 00:11:28.703]  Again, right out of zombie lore.
[00:11:29.183 --> 00:11:33.685]  While onlookers look on and won't even help the man.
[00:11:35.105 --> 00:11:36.306]  Somebody call for an ambulance.
[00:11:36.346 --> 00:11:36.886]  Yeah, we call.
[00:11:37.126 --> 00:11:38.347]  Oh my god.
[00:11:38.407 --> 00:11:39.667]  Baby, you gotta stop.
[00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:40.587]  Baby, you gotta stop.
[00:11:40.627 --> 00:11:41.808]  He gonna beat your head.
[00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:42.188]  Stop.
[00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:44.589]  You're the f***ing problem.
[00:11:45.669 --> 00:11:46.330]  You're making this s*** up.
[00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.951]  I'm not doing nothing for you.
[00:11:51.032 --> 00:11:52.012]  Oh my God.
[00:11:52.032 --> 00:11:53.513]  I didn't call you guys.
[00:11:53.553 --> 00:11:55.393]  I wouldn't get involved.
[00:11:55.494 --> 00:11:56.294]  Obviously.
[00:11:56.474 --> 00:11:57.674]  Man, that's his car.
[00:11:57.794 --> 00:11:58.434]  That's his.
[00:11:58.495 --> 00:11:59.795]  That's his car.
[00:12:01.656 --> 00:12:04.036]  Oh my gosh.
[00:12:04.096 --> 00:12:04.817]  Oh my God!
[00:12:05.137 --> 00:12:06.437]  Oh my God.
[00:12:06.457 --> 00:12:10.599]  I ain't tell... I ain't... I got... Somebody catch her, man.
[00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:11.999]  Yeah, I got... Watch out.
[00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:12.479]  Watch out.
[00:12:12.539 --> 00:12:13.059]  Watch out.
[00:12:13.119 --> 00:12:13.560]  Don't hit her.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.380]  Don't hit... Don't hit her, though.
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.100]  Don't hit her, though.
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.081]  Just... Come on, baby.
[00:12:17.101 --> 00:12:17.821]  You got it.
[00:12:18.641 --> 00:12:20.502]  He biting the shit out of her.
[00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.561]  Now, there are many other examples just this week.
[00:12:29.742 --> 00:12:31.022]  Not just here, but around the world.
[00:12:31.522 --> 00:12:46.369]  But let's look at just one more from Georgia, where a family is walking with their young daughter and son down the street, and a out-of-work liberal artist, as she describes herself, quickly, like she's shanking someone in prison,
[00:12:47.665 --> 00:12:53.027]  Almost completely chops the little boy's nose off, and then stabs two huge wounds in his face.
[00:12:53.568 --> 00:13:00.651]  She then goes for the mother, goes for the little girl, the father tries to defend, and she tries to again stab him to death.
[00:13:01.251 --> 00:13:07.394]  The police acted like it was no big deal, and a lone female officer put her in handcuffs and walked her away.
[00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:48.699]  Well, the three events that we've seen just in the last few days are overshadowed by another shocking mass shooting, this time in Odessa, Texas.
[00:13:48.739 --> 00:13:59.202]  And as we go to press on Saturday evening, it's more than 10 people shot, at least one dead, a man reportedly driving around indiscriminately outside a movie theater and mall shooting people.
[00:13:59.702 --> 00:14:06.727]  But whether it's a butcher knife or whether it's bare hands, it is the mind of these people that are going completely psychotic that is to blame.
[00:14:07.087 --> 00:14:08.128]  But what's triggering it?
[00:14:08.568 --> 00:14:09.369]  What's causing it?
[00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:12.731]  We're going to look at it right now because we can take all the guns in the world.
[00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:20.536]  It's not going to stop Antifa devil worshippers like the man that attacked all those people in Ohio last month who went out to kill innocents.
[00:14:21.076 --> 00:14:24.819]  They're doing it to bring in a global crisis, a global collapse.
[00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.521]  But the lesson is crystal clear.
[00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:34.934]  Innocent, law-abiding citizens need to be armed to protect themselves now more than ever, and need to be vigilant.
[00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:36.214]  Watch your children.
[00:14:36.755 --> 00:14:37.395]  Watch your back.
[00:14:37.975 --> 00:14:38.776]  Watch your family.
[00:14:39.236 --> 00:14:40.016]  Watch your community.
[00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:41.937]  Because society is breaking down.
[00:14:42.598 --> 00:14:43.518]  Evil is rising.
[00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:46.160]  What's happening?
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.141]  Why is this intensifying?
[00:14:48.861 --> 00:14:52.683]  Why do the statistics show that senseless violence is on the uptick?
[00:14:52.703 --> 00:14:55.885]  I'm going to break down the four reasons right now.
[00:14:57.202 --> 00:15:05.724]  Number one is chemicals and electromagnetic radiation that is unnatural and has been proven to be affecting our brains.
[00:15:06.687 --> 00:15:21.239]  They approved Prozac back in the 1980s and on the insert it admitted that it caused a major increase in psychotic breaks, psychosis, delusions of grandeur, suicidal ideations, and homicidal violent attacks.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:35.010]  And almost every senseless mass shooter has been on these psychotropic so-called antidepressants that are in the hallucinogen class and put people into a dream state.
[00:15:35.771 --> 00:15:49.214]  Before so-called anti-depressants, that I call suicide mass murder pills, were pushed on the public and adopted widely, women statistically, in any criminology book, were less than 2% of violent crime.
[00:15:50.034 --> 00:16:00.437]  Since women began taking these pills, we have seen a massive increase in women carrying out crimes that statistically you would only see men carrying out.
[00:16:03.612 --> 00:16:05.574]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[00:16:05.995 --> 00:16:12.262]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[00:16:12.603 --> 00:16:16.568]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[00:16:17.088 --> 00:16:23.076]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:29.599]  Ultra-purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:41.545]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[00:16:42.025 --> 00:16:51.270]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.619]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.

[00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:14.392]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[00:17:14.852 --> 00:17:18.494]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[00:17:18.994 --> 00:17:28.359]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[00:17:29.099 --> 00:17:30.600]  The system is vulnerable.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.301]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:36.863]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:43.807]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[00:17:44.327 --> 00:17:49.710]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[00:18:07.339 --> 00:18:11.261]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[00:18:11.681 --> 00:18:13.502]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:18:13.602 --> 00:18:14.303]  Good to talk to you.
[00:18:14.643 --> 00:18:18.825]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[00:18:19.045 --> 00:18:20.786]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[00:18:20.886 --> 00:18:25.268]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[00:18:25.489 --> 00:18:27.390]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.812]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[00:18:31.892 --> 00:18:33.373]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:18:33.413 --> 00:18:33.893]  Tell us about it.
[00:18:33.973 --> 00:18:34.673]  Well, it's really great.
[00:18:34.693 --> 00:18:35.893]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:18:35.933 --> 00:18:36.373]  I take it.
[00:18:36.433 --> 00:18:37.054]  It tastes good.
[00:18:37.114 --> 00:18:38.814]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:18:38.874 --> 00:18:40.554]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:18:40.714 --> 00:18:43.195]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[00:18:43.215 --> 00:18:44.015]  So I really like it.
[00:18:44.035 --> 00:18:46.695]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:18:46.735 --> 00:18:48.276]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:18:48.396 --> 00:18:50.256]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:53.096]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy.
[00:18:53.557 --> 00:18:55.897]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[00:18:56.257 --> 00:18:57.157]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[00:19:24.433 --> 00:19:24.974]  What's that mean?
[00:19:25.034 --> 00:19:26.254]  What's that mean?
[00:19:26.735 --> 00:19:28.115]  Oh, you're mad!

[00:19:37.318 --> 00:19:39.379]  You're calling the f***ing riots over here.
[00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:39.659]  What?
[00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:42.379]  Yeah, by even making me talk to a trader.
[00:19:42.819 --> 00:19:43.559]  A trader of what?
[00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.260]  My country?
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.220]  Look at me!
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:45.940]  Look at me!
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.260]  What's that say right there?
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.900]  Don't tread on me!
[00:19:50.561 --> 00:19:52.721]  That's a Russian slogan now.
[00:19:53.021 --> 00:19:54.642]  That's a Russian slogan.
[00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:56.422]  By nationalist traders.
[00:20:05.242 --> 00:20:11.208]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:16.394 --> 00:20:24.182]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:26.448 --> 00:20:44.122]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live on this Sunday edition, and I'm about to be in the studio, but I want to finish up this report dealing with the breakdown of civilization and society, and the fact that as we devalue ourselves, we can expect more and more psychotic behavior like we just saw in this mass shooting in Odessa, Texas.
[00:20:44.142 --> 00:20:48.045]  Here's more on the video report you can find and share at InfoWars.com.
[00:20:48.485 --> 00:20:53.409]  The zombie apocalypse is real, and it's already here, but it's not undead.
[00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:54.990]  It's people that are spiritually dead.
[00:20:57.537 --> 00:20:59.539]  You may have heard of this before in fiction.
[00:21:00.099 --> 00:21:18.036]  Films like The Hunger Games and the book series it's based on is actually the UN Agenda 21 program to return the world to basically a feudal system with the lords and the elites behind castle walls and the rest of us living The Hunger Games for real.
[00:21:24.355 --> 00:21:28.976]  This controlled collapse is already resembling a zombie apocalypse.
[00:21:29.517 --> 00:21:39.820]  And the Pentagon quietly started, 15 years ago, training Army, Marines, and other personnel in mass drills to repel zombie apocalypse.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.680]  Now, why is that?
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:41.660]  U.S.
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:53.687]  studies, Israeli studies, Russian studies, European studies from World War II show that within five days of no electricity or the breakdown of civilization, most people start committing crimes.
[00:21:54.267 --> 00:21:57.489]  Within 10 days, most people become homicidal maniacs.
[00:21:57.929 --> 00:22:02.612]  Within 15 days, 90% of people on average become cannibals.
[00:22:02.992 --> 00:22:07.355]  The other 10% either fight to the death or commit suicide.
[00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:17.882]  So again, it's been the London Guardian, it's been NBC News, it was reported years after we first documented it, that the military is training to take on zombie apocalypse.
[00:22:17.922 --> 00:22:19.443]  Well you go, zombies don't exist.
[00:22:19.803 --> 00:22:30.231]  Well no, not undead that are reanimated, but the general spoiled out of control public that doesn't know how to grow tomatoes, doesn't know how to fix a car, doesn't know how to basically do any work.
[00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:38.834]  Within just a few days of the welfare debit cards not working, we'll turn into the equivalent of zombies.
[00:22:39.595 --> 00:22:49.519]  Or a hundred million army ants that when they go through the rainforest in the Amazon, clear every twig, every piece of food, and eat everything in their way.
[00:22:50.299 --> 00:22:59.586]  This is a planned sabotage of culture, the planned takedown of civilization, so that the so-called elites can break away with their Type 1 civilization.
[00:22:59.946 --> 00:23:01.627]  They've already decided humans are obsolete.
[00:23:02.007 --> 00:23:03.709]  They've already decided to merge with machines.
[00:23:04.249 --> 00:23:08.472]  The so-called environmental movement is a post-human global exterminist operation.
[00:23:08.932 --> 00:23:10.293]  I told you this 25 years ago.
[00:23:10.614 --> 00:23:12.215]  I made the film Endgame 11 years ago.
[00:23:12.735 --> 00:23:18.980]  Now it's the cover story at NBC News as they prepare you for the collapse of civilization.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.122]  Being aware of this can reverse it.
[00:23:22.743 --> 00:23:35.255]  But the homelessness, the encouragement of the slacker lifestyle, the encouragement of letting crime build up in our cities is a time bomb that places like Communist China do not accept because they don't intend to collapse.
[00:23:35.535 --> 00:23:40.360]  This is being done to us to demoralize us and prepare the West for total implosion.
[00:23:41.232 --> 00:23:47.798]  This report is critical to the future of civilization, the future of humanity, and your personal future and your family's future.
[00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:52.663]  The system censors us like no other because we've studied their operation and we know how to stop them.
[00:23:53.063 --> 00:23:55.345]  Please, however you can, share this video.
[00:23:55.546 --> 00:23:57.587]  Feel free to re-upload it anywhere you want.
[00:23:58.048 --> 00:24:05.195]  But whatever you do, please take action because without you sharing this video, we will succumb to this plan.
[00:24:06.087 --> 00:24:08.348]  But if you take action, we will prevail.
[00:24:08.728 --> 00:24:09.748]  Thank you all for watching.
[00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:14.210]  Please research the claims I've made, discover they're true for yourself, and please take action now.
[00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.951]  You can call these people that are succumbing to our toxic environment zombies.
[00:24:19.872 --> 00:24:21.052]  You can call them demon-possessed.
[00:24:22.252 --> 00:24:26.314]  But you can't deny the fact that this phenomenon is taking place right now.
[00:24:27.254 --> 00:24:28.315]  It's time to get involved.
[00:24:28.475 --> 00:24:29.575]  It's time to wake others up.
[00:24:29.615 --> 00:24:33.836]  And it's time to get on our knees and ask God to lead, guide, and direct us.
[00:24:49.892 --> 00:24:55.397]  ...to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices ahead of this critical midterm election.
[00:24:55.937 --> 00:25:09.349]  And the big tech companies and the head of Apple admit that they met with Senator Warner, who's running this whole thing, to begin shutting down conservatives or the Democrats threatened to federalize big tech if they did not basically roll over to them.
[00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:15.855]  So the Republicans left a vacuum there by not coming in with regulations to say you cannot violate people's free speech.
[00:25:16.335 --> 00:25:20.878]  Mr. Jones, today's, this morning's hearing is specifically about preventing election manipulation.
[00:25:21.238 --> 00:25:22.879]  This afternoon's hearing is... Sure, sure.
[00:25:22.899 --> 00:25:23.520]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:26.482]  But every time they have these meetings, they bring up info wars.
[00:25:26.802 --> 00:25:29.344]  They claim they're taking info wars down to stop election meddling.
[00:25:29.364 --> 00:25:30.945]  Obama established...
[00:25:31.545 --> 00:25:34.948]  With an executive order, a special office that deals with foreign propaganda.
[00:25:35.248 --> 00:25:39.412]  What it's really been used is to target domestic populist, popular groups.
[00:25:40.292 --> 00:25:49.540]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadow banning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:56.886]  Even the New York Times calls it a crackdown on conservatives and a plan to de-platform conservatives from the internet and communicating
[00:25:56.966 --> 00:25:57.466]  To date?
[00:26:21.445 --> 00:26:22.105]  But I'll say this.
[00:26:22.305 --> 00:26:24.606]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media.
[00:26:24.927 --> 00:26:34.691]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working with big tech.
[00:26:53.249 --> 00:27:01.743]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:27:05.209 --> 00:27:07.090]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:11.913]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[00:27:11.953 --> 00:27:15.614]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[00:27:15.654 --> 00:27:19.616]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[00:27:19.737 --> 00:27:22.758]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[00:27:22.858 --> 00:27:29.982]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[00:27:30.122 --> 00:27:30.622]  Dangerous.
[00:27:30.642 --> 00:27:31.182]  Dangerous.
[00:27:31.222 --> 00:27:31.723]  Dangerous.
[00:27:31.763 --> 00:27:32.363]  Dangerous.
[00:27:32.923 --> 00:27:34.043]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:27:34.063 --> 00:27:35.184]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:27:35.224 --> 00:27:37.844]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[00:27:37.905 --> 00:27:42.146]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[00:27:42.306 --> 00:27:43.346]  They call me dangerous.
[00:27:43.446 --> 00:27:44.866]  Danger is my middle name.
[00:27:45.066 --> 00:27:47.007]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[00:27:47.147 --> 00:27:50.408]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[00:27:50.508 --> 00:27:55.109]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[00:27:55.209 --> 00:27:56.650]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:27:56.850 --> 00:28:01.131]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[00:28:01.451 --> 00:28:03.993]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[00:28:04.173 --> 00:28:06.054]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[00:28:06.194 --> 00:28:08.396]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[00:28:08.936 --> 00:28:11.258]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[00:28:11.378 --> 00:28:12.399]  I want them shut down.
[00:28:12.459 --> 00:28:13.380]  I want them silenced.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.100]  I want them muted.
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.082]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:28:16.242 --> 00:28:17.563]  I want them shut down.
[00:28:17.963 --> 00:28:19.164]  I want them silenced.
[00:28:19.184 --> 00:28:19.964]  I want them muted.
[00:28:20.085 --> 00:28:23.287]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:42.938]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content, and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[00:28:42.978 --> 00:28:44.860]  President Trump was sworn in in January of 2017.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.424]  The average farm journal and poll had him at about 50% with farmers.
[00:29:14.105 --> 00:29:28.758]  Fast forward to August 2019, two and a half years later, and he's at 79% in the farm journal survey, which is the most respected, and other farm journals show him as high as 90%.
[00:29:28.938 --> 00:29:33.542]  No president since these journals have existed.
[00:29:35.521 --> 00:29:36.502]  has had numbers this time.
[00:29:37.022 --> 00:29:38.784]  Now, why am I so excited about that?
[00:29:38.884 --> 00:29:39.965]  Why am I so proud of that?
[00:29:42.707 --> 00:29:47.410]  Farmers got assaulted by the Democrats who tried to take some of their subsidies away.
[00:29:48.211 --> 00:29:52.554]  Trump came in and was reasonable about it and said, hey, foreign countries have internal tariffs.
[00:29:52.714 --> 00:29:53.475]  I'll get rid of those.
[00:29:53.975 --> 00:29:58.019]  We don't need all these subsidies, but we'll actually let you compete directly into those markets.
[00:29:58.839 --> 00:30:03.463]  And when China put massive tariffs on US farmers,
[00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.291]  Their support for Trump only went up.
[00:30:06.732 --> 00:30:11.936]  And then, when China banned, a week ago, all U.S.
[00:30:11.956 --> 00:30:15.439]  produce, Trump's numbers went up.
[00:30:16.219 --> 00:30:20.883]  Now, I talk about this all the time, but this is the key to everything.
[00:30:20.943 --> 00:30:31.972]  When Americans and free people know they're being dominated and assaulted and bullied, and they know that it's artificial and that it's from outside, they will rally and come together every time.
[00:30:33.339 --> 00:30:37.300]  You know, I harp on this constantly, that these globalists, the Democrats, are bullies.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:54.645]  And they think that if they attack us, and lie about us, and call us Nazis, and physically come after us, and dox our homes, and tell us the American flag sucks, and that America's bad, that somehow we'll become demoralized, and kneel to them, bow to them.
[00:30:56.065 --> 00:30:56.826]  That's not what's happening.
[00:30:57.926 --> 00:31:01.367]  Americans were asleep before, because they thought everything was fine.
[00:31:02.628 --> 00:31:04.829]  Now Americans know that the country's in peril.
[00:31:05.189 --> 00:31:07.149]  And they know that Trump at Infowars is fighting.
[00:31:08.169 --> 00:31:10.070]  And so now they're ready for a war.
[00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:11.630]  They're ready for a battle.
[00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:19.352]  And so when the Chi-Coms come in and say, we're going to put tariffs on your goods, they say, oh, we support Trump more.
[00:31:20.792 --> 00:31:26.733]  And then when they say, we're banning all your food, we're going to all cost each one of your families a large piece of their paycheck.
[00:31:27.153 --> 00:31:29.014]  Because China imports a lot of food from us, they can't produce it.
[00:31:30.034 --> 00:31:30.354]  That's fine.
[00:31:30.374 --> 00:31:31.174]  Go ahead and do that.
[00:31:31.674 --> 00:31:33.875]  Because you've been screwing our industry over forever.
[00:31:34.135 --> 00:31:38.936]  And the farmers get what the Rust Belt and the factories and the workers have gone through.
[00:31:38.956 --> 00:31:39.897]  And they're standing up.
[00:31:40.137 --> 00:31:45.638]  Because farmers have a long history in this country of standing up to tyranny because they understand how the system operates.
[00:31:45.658 --> 00:31:48.279]  And Thomas Jefferson said it will be the yeoman farmers
[00:31:48.999 --> 00:31:58.886]  That will end up being the heart of this country, and when the country's in crisis, it'll be the farmers, who are close to the ground, and close to the earth, and close to reality, who are going to be the ones that save the nation.
[00:31:59.306 --> 00:32:11.715]  So I'm so proud of America's farmers, for a race, color, and creed, who are the heartland of this nation, and who understand that, hey, you try to intimidate me, you try to bully me, because our president stood up for our industry?
[00:32:12.375 --> 00:32:18.476]  We're ready to take it on the chin in this fight because we understand it's for a greater good.
[00:32:18.916 --> 00:32:26.637]  America had surrendered for 50 years to globalism and deindustrialization and 30 years selling our jobs out to China.
[00:32:26.977 --> 00:32:28.698]  And that surrender is open.
[00:32:29.478 --> 00:32:30.458]  But I'll say this to farmers.
[00:32:31.218 --> 00:32:32.158]  You think you're under attack?
[00:32:32.638 --> 00:32:33.939]  InfoWars is under attack as well.
[00:32:33.979 --> 00:32:36.539]  And I notice that it's farming families that really support us.
[00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:37.599]  You're our strongest group.
[00:32:37.619 --> 00:32:40.040]  You understand that we're in the same position you're in.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.360]  You think you've been sanctioned?
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.821]  They have unleashed hell on us, but you know what?
[00:32:44.121 --> 00:32:56.446]  We're still here because of you, so please, whether it's coffee, or toothpaste, or fish oil, or turmeric, we got great products at great prices at Infowarslife.com, Infowarsstore.com, and your financial support is what keeps us here as well.
[00:32:56.967 --> 00:32:58.447]  So, the globalists have sanctioned us.
[00:32:59.268 --> 00:33:02.729]  That's okay, because the farmers of America are standing with us, and we stand with you.
[00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:11.153]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:15.582]  Yeah, we're good.
[00:33:24.591 --> 00:33:28.633]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:29.413 --> 00:33:30.834]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:31.114 --> 00:33:32.234]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:32.774 --> 00:33:37.496]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:38.056 --> 00:33:40.157]  And we're launching the show now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:40.177 --> 00:33:41.978]  We'll never fear.
[00:33:42.038 --> 00:33:47.340]  We're live on this September 1st, 2019 global transmission.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.641]  We're going to cover the waterfront right now.
[00:33:51.303 --> 00:33:54.005]  This is Paul Judson with Summit.News and Action 7 News.
[00:33:54.045 --> 00:33:55.086]  We're here in Hong Kong.
[00:33:55.106 --> 00:33:57.548]  This is Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[00:33:57.608 --> 00:34:01.612]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Rees for the next week.
[00:34:01.632 --> 00:34:04.134]  This is Greg Rees for InfoWars.com in Hong Kong.
[00:34:04.434 --> 00:34:08.357]  Our recent trip to Hong Kong was a new achievement for InfoWars.com.
[00:34:09.298 --> 00:34:16.782]  Despite being the most banned broadcast in the free world, we continue to win because of our great, strong, loyal audience.
[00:34:17.342 --> 00:34:33.350]  We have Dan Lyman covering InfoWars Europe, Paul Joseph Watson in the UK, Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett in the American heartland, and from Austin, Texas, a team of reporters and crew ready to be dispatched wherever the story is going down.
[00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:37.472]  We are not done winning, and with your support, we will keep winning.
[00:34:38.012 --> 00:34:38.733]  We have to keep winning!
[00:34:39.014 --> 00:34:40.376]  We have to win more!
[00:34:40.476 --> 00:34:42.819]  Go to InfoWarStore.com.
[00:34:42.859 --> 00:34:50.992]  You have gone to InfoWarStore.com and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need!
[00:34:58.774 --> 00:35:01.556]  Let me tell you, we're having some fun tonight.
[00:35:01.996 --> 00:35:04.638]  We are kicking September off just right.
[00:35:05.439 --> 00:35:06.500]  It's September 1st, 2019.
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.142]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:35:10.122 --> 00:35:15.747]  And normally we kick the show off live on Sundays or on Mondays or Wednesdays or Thursdays or Fridays.
[00:35:16.327 --> 00:35:16.887]  Today,
[00:35:18.455 --> 00:35:42.163]  I chalk it up to gremlins because last week the big fancy expensive audio board just broke right before the show just burned out and died and then today it was the big video switcher died in the other studio and then folks had been playing tiddlywinks in this studio on Friday and didn't put him back so it took us 30 minutes to get up and running but that's okay because guess what happened I'm coming in tomorrow now
[00:35:43.331 --> 00:35:47.595]  In fact, I'm doing all four juicy hours live.
[00:35:48.475 --> 00:35:50.777]  And then, I'm doing The War Room.
[00:35:51.598 --> 00:35:52.098]  That's right.
[00:35:52.979 --> 00:35:57.303]  I'm gonna do seven hours of live shows tomorrow.
[00:35:57.843 --> 00:36:03.188]  Because we're hitting the quickening right now, and it's gotta be done, and I gotta lead by example.
[00:36:03.568 --> 00:36:04.409]  So I'm gonna be here.
[00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:09.153]  In fact, I'm gonna broadcast next Sunday for ten hours, probably.
[00:36:09.895 --> 00:36:11.716]  Because that's what's going to happen.
[00:36:12.117 --> 00:36:14.658]  We're going to intensify our attacks on the globalists.
[00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:15.959]  And we're not going to stop.
[00:36:15.979 --> 00:36:17.120]  We're not going to back down ever.
[00:36:18.201 --> 00:36:22.644]  Well, I did about, oh, five hours of preparation yesterday.
[00:36:22.664 --> 00:36:26.387]  And I did about five hours of preparation today at home.
[00:36:27.547 --> 00:36:31.991]  And I've got this whole incredibly important transmission lined up for you.
[00:36:32.011 --> 00:36:33.552]  And I respect the listeners.
[00:36:34.212 --> 00:36:36.334]  And I respect the viewers very, very deeply.
[00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:40.913]  For jumping through all the hoops over the years to keep us on air and to tune in.
[00:36:40.933 --> 00:36:49.539]  And I really appreciate all of our AM and FM affiliates, our TV affiliates, and WWCR, the Global Shortwave, and the satellite folks that put us out, and everybody in this crew.
[00:36:50.019 --> 00:36:54.503]  And we've been going through growing pains as we've used my show for training.
[00:36:55.524 --> 00:37:00.948]  And so we are training on my show to launch some new shows that will be announced in just the next week and a half or so.
[00:37:00.968 --> 00:37:03.870]  So a lot of exciting things going on here.
[00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:05.371]  And there's no teleprompters here.
[00:37:06.636 --> 00:37:08.877]  I'm not a robot, you know, being told what to say and do.
[00:37:08.917 --> 00:37:10.918]  This is a real system.
[00:37:10.938 --> 00:37:13.239]  This is a real organic resistance out of Texas.
[00:37:13.259 --> 00:37:16.681]  We're not in fancy Los Angeles or fancy pants New York City.
[00:37:17.642 --> 00:37:19.623]  We're just right here in Texas.
[00:37:19.763 --> 00:37:24.206]  You know, I was down here in Austin before it became the Fancy Pants headquarters of this area.
[00:37:25.027 --> 00:37:27.088]  And, you know, if I had my druthers, I would leave it.
[00:37:27.288 --> 00:37:29.190]  But the full investment's here.
[00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:30.751]  The crew is here.
[00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:34.573]  And we've been invaded by the dregs of the people that made California fall apart.
[00:37:34.593 --> 00:37:35.614]  They're not really Californians.
[00:37:35.634 --> 00:37:43.639]  They're the offspring of the carpetbaggers and people that moved to California and sucked that state dry and now have moved on to conquer Texas.
[00:37:43.699 --> 00:37:47.122]  And we're only four to eight years away from being a blue state.
[00:37:47.942 --> 00:37:53.423]  So most folks I know are already evacuating Montana and Utah and Idaho, but that's not going to work.
[00:37:53.483 --> 00:37:57.064]  The left, once we build something there, will just come there and feed on us.
[00:37:57.724 --> 00:38:00.524]  But you know, our biggest enemy is not the satanic left.
[00:38:00.604 --> 00:38:01.844]  Our biggest enemy is ourselves.
[00:38:02.485 --> 00:38:06.485]  And the fact that the average person, all the studies show, is in a dream state.
[00:38:08.366 --> 00:38:11.666]  And the average person has an IQ less than a goldfish.
[00:38:11.726 --> 00:38:16.107]  And a goldfish is an IQ, not an IQ, attention span, but maybe lower than
[00:38:17.329 --> 00:38:17.729]  I don't know.
[00:38:36.564 --> 00:38:43.306]  But they do not have an attention span, unless it's a video game they're playing, or, you know, maybe a football game they're watching.
[00:38:43.346 --> 00:38:53.128]  They're trained to give their attention span to something that manipulates their dopamine and gives them continually changing inputs.
[00:38:53.768 --> 00:39:01.210]  And so the globalists sit back while the general public has been put into this mind control trance, and they rule over us.
[00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:05.311]  And it's truly, truly disgusting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:06.803 --> 00:39:10.224]  We're going to break out of it, and we're going to conquer it, and we're going to deal with it.
[00:39:10.264 --> 00:39:12.965]  But as I said, I will be live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:39:13.045 --> 00:39:13.945]  Central Standard Time.
[00:39:13.965 --> 00:39:18.287]  Lord willing, unless my car blows up or something, I mean, you know, who knows?
[00:39:18.887 --> 00:39:24.849]  But I will be here, hook or crook, covering it all and doing it all, because that's what has to happen.
[00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:38.657]  Because while the average American is just seeking after pleasure and seeking after diversions, the globalists are working around the clock to take everything you've got and create a post-human, post-industrial world.
[00:39:38.897 --> 00:39:40.938]  And I, for one, am not going to sit back and watch that happen.
[00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:46.882]  So, here, let's just begin to tell you about what's coming up next segment.
[00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:48.431]  Obviously.
[00:39:49.371 --> 00:39:57.519]  We're starting the show a little late today, but we're going to get into the gunman in West Texas shooting identified as Seth Ator.
[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:05.607]  And this individual got pulled over by the police and then went crazy and began just indiscriminately shooting.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.662]  That's normally what you see with a Mexican drug cartel.
[00:40:10.082 --> 00:40:11.523]  That's what they do when the cops pull them over.
[00:40:11.563 --> 00:40:14.585]  They start shooting at the cops, shooting everybody else, so everybody runs for cover.
[00:40:15.206 --> 00:40:16.486]  I don't know if this is connected to that.
[00:40:16.566 --> 00:40:17.027]  Who knows?
[00:40:17.867 --> 00:40:22.470]  But what I do know is, is that you have 12,000 people a year that die from guns in the United States.
[00:40:23.911 --> 00:40:30.636]  And what I do know is that around 9,000 of those are suicides.
[00:40:31.136 --> 00:40:32.217]  So we've got
[00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:47.401]  Quite a few people that are being killed in drive-by shootings, are being killed by murderers, but still statistically, ladies and gentlemen, tens of thousands drowned, tens of thousands fall and hit their head in the bathroom and die.
[00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:49.042]  And I pulled up the numbers here.
[00:40:49.342 --> 00:40:54.763]  They're always four or five years behind on statistics, but in 2016, 50 plus thousand people died from prescription
[00:40:59.466 --> 00:40:59.926]  Opioids.
[00:41:00.526 --> 00:41:06.348]  Now, they've been reporting that it's 10 times worse now than it was a decade ago, but we don't have the exact numbers.
[00:41:06.388 --> 00:41:11.670]  So, let's just say hundreds of thousands of people are dying a year from drug overdoses.
[00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:14.091]  That famous baseball player just died from fentanyl.
[00:41:15.031 --> 00:41:17.713]  But you see, Trump's trying to make that a big front and center issue.
[00:41:17.873 --> 00:41:19.154]  I've tried to make it a big issue, too.
[00:41:19.574 --> 00:41:23.977]  Most people have friends or family that are crippled by opiates.
[00:41:24.017 --> 00:41:25.898]  They've been causing problems for thousands of years.
[00:41:26.419 --> 00:41:29.321]  There's an old number, 2017, says 47,600.
[00:41:29.781 --> 00:41:32.903]  I actually have the federal government's own numbers here.
[00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:38.006]  I had to move my articles over from the other side, and they got mixed together.
[00:41:38.046 --> 00:41:44.691]  So I'm going to get to this later in the next hour, but will someone go and reprint, because I'm not going to dig through these stacks.
[00:41:46.152 --> 00:41:46.993]  No, can't do it now.
[00:41:47.013 --> 00:41:48.174]  I had them all stacked up.
[00:41:48.234 --> 00:41:49.615]  It's okay, they got moved over and mixed.
[00:41:50.195 --> 00:41:51.356]  Or it's my fault, I mixed them wrong.
[00:41:51.677 --> 00:41:54.679]  The point is, is that I have the federal number that's 53,000.
[00:41:54.759 --> 00:41:56.340]  That graph we showed says 47,000 in 2016.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:56.521]  No, no, 53,000.
[00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:58.042]  So we're going to show you that as well.
[00:41:58.062 --> 00:41:58.142]  Okay?
[00:42:07.629 --> 00:42:15.555]  And we're going to just basically look at the facts here that automobiles kill hundreds of thousands of people a year.
[00:42:16.916 --> 00:42:25.922]  But again, they hype up mass shootings because it is scary to think you can go to the movie theater or go to the shopping mall and then some crazy person comes in and kills you.
[00:42:25.962 --> 00:42:26.342]  But out of 300
[00:42:28.496 --> 00:42:31.499]  And probably 60 million people if you count all the illegal aliens.
[00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:33.501]  But 330 million people in the census.
[00:42:33.821 --> 00:42:37.305]  It's very rare to get shot in a mass shooting.
[00:42:38.146 --> 00:42:41.049]  Just like it's rare to have somebody break in your house and shoot you.
[00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:42.410]  But it's still terrible if it happens to you.
[00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:47.976]  But the point is the media is hyping this to launch red flag laws and try to take
[00:42:49.196 --> 00:42:50.037]  All of our guns.
[00:42:50.817 --> 00:42:53.219]  So that then they can really have some fun with us.
[00:42:53.679 --> 00:42:55.020]  We'll be back with all the latest.
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.461]  And that to O'Rourke saying confiscate all the guns.
[00:42:57.761 --> 00:42:58.202]  Straight ahead.
[00:42:58.222 --> 00:42:58.702]  Please stay with us.

[00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:37.047]  But guess what?

[00:44:03.046 --> 00:44:09.670]  Donald, you're probably the best-known builder, particularly of great buildings in the city.
[00:44:10.191 --> 00:44:22.179]  There's a great deal of question about whether or not the damage and the ultimate destruction of the buildings was caused by the airplanes, by architectural defect, or possibly by bombs or aftershocks.
[00:44:22.199 --> 00:44:23.380]  Do you have any thoughts on that?
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.981]  Well, it was an architectural defect.
[00:44:25.001 --> 00:44:28.143]  You know, the World Trade Center was always known as a very, very strong building.
[00:44:28.163 --> 00:44:30.124]  Don't forget, that took a big bomb in the basement.
[00:44:30.184 --> 00:44:32.946]  Now, the basement is the most vulnerable place, because that's your foundation.
[00:44:33.548 --> 00:44:34.692]  And it withstood that.
[00:44:34.892 --> 00:44:36.397]  And I got to see that area.
[00:44:37.123 --> 00:44:43.786]  About three or four days after it took place, because one of my structural engineers actually took me for a tour, because he did the building.
[00:44:43.926 --> 00:44:45.107]  And I said, I can't believe it.
[00:44:45.127 --> 00:44:49.249]  The building was standing solid, and half of the columns were blown out.
[00:44:49.289 --> 00:44:52.351]  I mean, so, this was an unbelievably powerful building.
[00:44:53.051 --> 00:44:56.893]  If you know anything about structure, it was one of the first buildings that was built from the outside.
[00:44:56.933 --> 00:45:03.436]  The steel, the reason the World Trade Center had such narrow windows, is that in between all the windows, you had the steel on the outside.
[00:45:03.476 --> 00:45:04.877]  So you had the steel on the outside of the building.
[00:45:05.357 --> 00:45:08.499]  That's why when I first looked, and you had big, heavy eye beams.
[00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:13.222]  When I first looked at it, I couldn't believe it because there was a hole in the steel.
[00:45:13.242 --> 00:45:18.085]  And this is steel that was, you remember the width of the windows of the World Trade Center, folks?
[00:45:18.145 --> 00:45:21.067]  I think, you know, if you were ever up there, they were quite narrow.
[00:45:21.787 --> 00:45:23.568]  And in between was this heavy steel.
[00:45:23.868 --> 00:45:32.053]  I said, how could a plane, even a plane, even a 767 or a 747, or whatever it might have been, how could it possibly go through the steel?
[00:45:32.594 --> 00:45:40.959]  I happen to think that they had not only a plane, but they had bombs that exploded almost simultaneously, because I just can't imagine anything being able to go through that wall.
[00:45:41.339 --> 00:45:44.781]  Most buildings are built with the steel that's on the inside around the elevator shaft.
[00:45:45.362 --> 00:45:48.704]  This one was built from the outside, which is the strongest structure you can have.
[00:45:49.444 --> 00:45:52.145]  And it was almost just like a can of soup.
[00:45:52.486 --> 00:46:07.593]  You know, Donald, we were looking at pictures all morning long of that plane coming into building number two, and when you see that approach the far side, and then all of a sudden, within a matter of a millisecond, the explosion pops out the other side.
[00:46:08.524 --> 00:46:11.146]  I just think that there was a plane with more than just fuel.
[00:46:11.166 --> 00:46:22.314]  I think, obviously, they were very big planes, they were going very rapidly, because I was also watching where the plane seemed to be not only going fast, it seemed to be coming down into the building.
[00:46:22.334 --> 00:46:24.936]  So it was getting the speed from going downhill, so to speak.
[00:46:25.677 --> 00:46:35.384]  It just seemed to me that to do that kind of destruction is even more than a big plane, because you're talking about taking out steel, the heaviest caliber steel that was used on a building.
[00:46:35.404 --> 00:46:36.885]  These buildings were rock solid.
[00:46:37.845 --> 00:46:41.370]  And, you know, it's just an amazing, it's an amazing thing.
[00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:49.400]  This country is different today and it's going to be different than it ever was for many years to come.
[00:46:50.281 --> 00:46:52.243]  Very profound statement and very true.
[00:47:05.023 --> 00:47:10.987]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:19.492 --> 00:47:24.555]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:40.896 --> 00:47:42.977]  Now it's the first broadcast of September 2019.
[00:47:44.818 --> 00:47:49.841]  I'm your host Alex Jones here live on the Sunday edition.
[00:47:49.881 --> 00:47:53.563]  I will be live tomorrow on the Monday edition for September 2nd, 2019.
[00:47:54.244 --> 00:47:56.065]  You can bet your boots.
[00:47:57.786 --> 00:48:03.249]  Now, we're obviously at a major historical crossroads right now.
[00:48:03.269 --> 00:48:09.453]  We are in the middle of a global quickening and the Democratic Party
[00:48:10.819 --> 00:48:15.160]  Represents the powerful global corporate interests that want to disarm dumbed-down population.
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.301]  They want a post-human world.
[00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:21.722]  To have a post-human world, you've got to disarm the people you want to get rid of.
[00:48:21.742 --> 00:48:26.423]  And by the way, if you're a new viewer or listener, you're saying, what do you mean a post-human world?
[00:48:28.764 --> 00:48:34.366]  Well, NBC last week had the big cover story that humans will soon be obsolete.
[00:48:34.426 --> 00:48:35.786]  Humans will be extinct.
[00:48:37.586 --> 00:48:39.147]  That's a good thing because we're bad.
[00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.733]  And it'll be good for the environment when the cyborgs rise.
[00:48:43.773 --> 00:48:45.114]  That's humans that merge the machines.
[00:48:45.474 --> 00:48:49.558]  Really, those will just be humans that are slaves of big tech.
[00:48:50.418 --> 00:48:56.383]  But they sell it like it's the ultimate status and how all the followers really become cool kids.
[00:48:57.704 --> 00:48:58.445]  There's the headline.
[00:48:58.645 --> 00:49:02.228]  Cyborgs will replace humans and remake the world, James Lovelock says.
[00:49:02.308 --> 00:49:06.411]  And you tune into Discovery Channel or any of these shows, it's like, there's too many humans!
[00:49:07.172 --> 00:49:07.973]  We need to get rid of them!
[00:49:08.797 --> 00:49:09.977]  We're gonna merge the machines!
[00:49:10.057 --> 00:49:11.998]  I don't believe in God, but I'm gonna become one!
[00:49:12.018 --> 00:49:12.758]  Ray Kurzweil!
[00:49:14.599 --> 00:49:16.760]  So they say this, and they do this, and they push this.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.221]  Everywhere.
[00:49:19.061 --> 00:49:19.621]  In every way.
[00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:31.586]  And then they tell us, oh, but we care about human life, and we care about the children, we care about people that get shot by guns, and we cry, and Beto cries, and then he kinda looks up and smiles and laughs.
[00:49:31.606 --> 00:49:34.987]  Maybe we can pull in Beto laughing in, uh,
[00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:40.462]  El Paso, a month ago.
[00:49:40.482 --> 00:49:42.703]  He does that weird demonic.
[00:49:42.944 --> 00:49:43.464]  It's terrible.
[00:49:43.504 --> 00:49:44.004]  They're dying.
[00:49:47.246 --> 00:49:50.908]  Oh, they don't care about the 115 million killed by the communist Chinese in their own country.
[00:49:50.928 --> 00:49:54.349]  They don't care about 50 million killed by Lenin and Stalin.
[00:49:54.369 --> 00:49:56.931]  They don't care about any of that.
[00:49:57.771 --> 00:50:01.373]  They don't care about the hundreds of thousands dead and tortured death in Cuba, probably millions.
[00:50:01.653 --> 00:50:02.654]  Same thing in Venezuela.
[00:50:05.295 --> 00:50:05.415]  No.
[00:50:07.398 --> 00:50:29.717]  But they know you've got a conscience, and they know you care, and they know when you hear about seven people dead, including the shooter, in Odessa, outside a mall in a movie theater, because the cops pulled this guy over, and then he just starts randomly shooting people, including a 17-month-old child amongst those that are injured.
[00:50:29.737 --> 00:50:32.059]  Well, we have the special report that really needs to be shared.
[00:50:32.099 --> 00:50:34.881]  It's really powerful, that I aired earlier.
[00:50:36.089 --> 00:50:36.689]  Pieces of.
[00:50:37.569 --> 00:50:42.651]  The headline is the zombie apocalypse is real and it's here.
[00:50:44.311 --> 00:51:02.797]  It's not undead walking around killing people but it's just this week a woman in Georgia walking by a mother and a father with their daughter and their son stabbing the three-year-old boy almost cutting his nose off going for his eyes but stabbing big giant holes in his face with a 10-inch butcher knife then trying to kill the little girl the mother and the father.
[00:51:04.312 --> 00:51:10.414]  One female officer put her in cuffs and just led her away.
[00:51:11.374 --> 00:51:13.355]  That story's on InfoWars.com with the video.
[00:51:13.775 --> 00:51:23.058]  And then another woman just attacked him, an Uber driver for no reason, tried to ram through his windshield, tried to go through the windshield, then began biting him like something out of a zombie movie.
[00:51:25.979 --> 00:51:31.821]  Maybe we should roll some B-roll of that just, you know, from the special report that we've got on the zombie apocalypse.
[00:51:31.841 --> 00:51:32.401]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:51:32.441 --> 00:51:32.721]  Perfect.
[00:51:34.151 --> 00:51:36.392]  And there's so many of these, I can't even play them all for you.
[00:51:38.113 --> 00:51:54.020]  Or then there's the guy running around in Tampa who just killed his sister and her daughter, his niece, for no reason, and then going and humping the groundskeeper and screaming satanic things and trying to bite him, trying to rape him and bite him.
[00:51:56.601 --> 00:51:57.621]  And then there's more videos.
[00:51:58.122 --> 00:52:03.104]  I've got probably, I don't know, five articles and a bunch of video of people in Sweden,
[00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:30.611]  France, Germany, England, and Italy of Muslims from Afghanistan and from Morocco and from Iraq walking up to people at bus stations, and of course they're all white, and targeting men, women, and children, and one guy stabbed
[00:52:32.557 --> 00:52:53.729]  Ten people, wounded nine, killed one, and there's an incredible haunting video up on InfoWars.com about it in France, where a Frenchman walks up, yeah, this has got the video, and doesn't even attack the guy, pleads with him, and then the Muslim drops the knife.
[00:52:55.210 --> 00:53:01.273]  So this big French guy comes up, can grab the butcher knife away, gets right in his striking distance, you know the guy's got a butcher knife,
[00:53:05.026 --> 00:53:08.207]  Risk his life not to punch that guy in the throat.
[00:53:08.907 --> 00:53:10.628]  That's domestication right there, folks.
[00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:14.369]  You take the knife away from him and you jam it up through his throat.
[00:53:16.029 --> 00:53:19.570]  But see, you go to Afghanistan, they just randomly kill each other for no reason.
[00:53:20.851 --> 00:53:23.111]  You go to Pakistan, they just randomly kill each other for no reason.
[00:53:25.552 --> 00:53:26.312]  It's very, very sad.
[00:53:26.332 --> 00:53:27.953]  A lot of it is the extreme inbreeding.
[00:53:28.919 --> 00:53:31.441]  Pakistanis are 2% of the population in the UK.
[00:53:31.481 --> 00:53:32.761]  They're 37% of deformities.
[00:53:33.102 --> 00:53:33.682]  Very sad.
[00:53:33.962 --> 00:53:35.303]  But marrying your sister ain't good.
[00:53:36.404 --> 00:53:38.445]  Whether you're British royalty or whether you're Pakistani.
[00:53:39.806 --> 00:53:40.686]  It's very dangerous.
[00:53:42.027 --> 00:53:42.567]  Very dangerous.
[00:53:42.667 --> 00:53:46.510]  Causes a lot of psychotic activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:47.490]  The level of mental illness.
[00:53:47.671 --> 00:53:49.251]  I mean, just watch the videos for yourself.
[00:53:50.172 --> 00:53:53.494]  But see, dozens stabbed to death all over Europe.
[00:53:54.635 --> 00:53:55.916]  Almost all by Muslims.
[00:53:56.857 --> 00:54:24.846]  Who do not allow white people in their areas, and no-go zones, and now they're expanding outside the no-go zones, and they look and act like zombies, just like the white dude in Tampa, the monster, killing his sister, and her daughter, his nephew, his niece, and you look at their faces, they have the same, and then he's just humping the greenskeeper after he's killed his sister, and trying to choke him while he tries to rape him.
[00:54:28.092 --> 00:54:33.416]  So, we'll play Beto O'Rourke, who says, oh, he's so sad it's effed up.
[00:54:33.656 --> 00:54:35.097]  Notice how CNN cusses.
[00:54:35.137 --> 00:54:36.918]  Everybody else can cuss, but not a conservative show.
[00:54:37.178 --> 00:54:38.339]  You know, the FCC would come after us.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.621]  But he cusses because it's so woke and so real.
[00:54:41.641 --> 00:54:47.926]  Now, I've got all these stacks of articles and all these videos.
[00:54:50.666 --> 00:54:56.369]  Of the Islamists raping and killing and attacking and bombing and running people over with cars.
[00:54:56.689 --> 00:54:57.670]  It's never on our news.
[00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:02.012]  And they want Infowars.com and Newswars.com shut down so you don't see it.
[00:55:02.232 --> 00:55:04.073]  And look, I'm not saying all the Muslims are bad people.
[00:55:04.373 --> 00:55:06.394]  The most dangerous thing to a Muslim is other Muslims.
[00:55:09.336 --> 00:55:10.536]  They're the biggest victims of Islam.
[00:55:10.697 --> 00:55:13.398]  But Islam has been expanding for 1400 years, taking the world over.
[00:55:13.418 --> 00:55:18.801]  The UN admits hundreds of thousands of Christians are killed a year by Muslims worldwide from Indonesia,
[00:55:20.049 --> 00:55:21.650]  To Nigeria.
[00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:23.290]  To France.
[00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:25.771]  And there's no coverage of it.
[00:55:26.551 --> 00:55:29.672]  Oh, but you get killed in mass shootings.
[00:55:29.852 --> 00:55:32.333]  Used to be about 100 a year in senseless mass shootings.
[00:55:33.153 --> 00:55:34.154]  You don't count gang-related.
[00:55:35.254 --> 00:55:36.194]  Now it's up to about 150.
[00:55:36.394 --> 00:55:38.535]  It's terrible.
[00:55:39.195 --> 00:55:40.476]  My goodness, it's a horrible thing.
[00:55:41.396 --> 00:55:43.857]  But how many people died on Texas roads today?
[00:55:44.747 --> 00:55:46.868]  I guarantee you, it's in the thousands.
[00:55:47.148 --> 00:55:48.009]  They've got signs up.
[00:55:48.669 --> 00:55:53.812]  I saw it on the sign last week that so far, what's 3,000-something people have died on Texas roads.
[00:55:55.553 --> 00:55:58.174]  Had a big flashing government billboard up, usually has Amber Alerts.
[00:55:58.654 --> 00:56:03.517]  Talk about 3,200-something Texans have died on Texas roads this year.
[00:56:04.337 --> 00:56:06.759]  But you see that being hyped up everywhere else?
[00:56:06.839 --> 00:56:07.039]  No.
[00:56:07.559 --> 00:56:10.480]  The Highway Patrol and the Transportation Department is like, hey, drive safe.
[00:56:10.921 --> 00:56:11.861]  Safe following distance.
[00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:13.122]  This is dangerous what you're doing.
[00:56:14.858 --> 00:56:17.860]  So you get 150 people or so killed in mass shootings.
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:18.780]  It's the end of the world.
[00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.162]  Everybody else that has guns has to turn their guns in.
[00:56:21.222 --> 00:56:21.922]  It's all our fault.
[00:56:25.224 --> 00:56:26.845]  So let's go out to break with Beto O'Rourke.
[00:56:28.726 --> 00:56:31.908]  Blaming gun owners and saying he wants to confiscate all semi-autos.
[00:56:31.928 --> 00:56:32.309]  Here it is.
[00:56:33.549 --> 00:56:34.750]  Congressman, welcome.
[00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:36.091]  Let's start on the shooting.
[00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:41.014]  I want to play for our viewers your reaction at a campaign stop last night.
[00:56:42.654 --> 00:56:48.107]  I don't know what the motivation is, do not yet know the firearms that were used or how they acquired them.
[00:56:48.528 --> 00:56:49.991]  But we do know this is f***ed up.
[00:56:54.568 --> 00:57:02.730]  Yeah, the rhetoric that we've used, the thoughts and prayers that you just referred to, it has done nothing to stop the epidemic of gun violence.
[00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:19.075]  To protect our kids, our families, our fellow Americans in public places, at a Walmart in El Paso where 22 were killed, in Sutherland Springs, in a church, one or two a day, all over this country, a hundred killed daily in the United States of America.
[00:57:19.415 --> 00:57:20.675]  We're averaging about 300 mass shootings
[00:57:22.936 --> 00:57:25.378]  A year, no other country comes close.
[00:57:25.418 --> 00:57:26.679]  So, yes, this is f***ed up.
[00:57:26.799 --> 00:57:36.927]  And if we don't call it out for what it is, if we're not able to speak clearly, if we're not able to act decisively, then we will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America.
[00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.408]  And I cannot accept that.
[00:57:38.528 --> 00:57:44.113]  And so, we're going to speak as defiantly and as strongly as we can, but we're also going to take action.
[00:57:44.353 --> 00:57:50.037]  Universal background checks, red flag laws, an end to the sales of weapons of war, and buying those AK-47s and AR-15s back
[00:57:53.655 --> 00:57:57.157]  Alex, I got a plug for the Patriot Points.
[00:57:57.477 --> 00:58:01.418]  I got $180 so far this year in Patriot Points and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[00:58:02.079 --> 00:58:05.120]  I buy so much in the store because I mean I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.301]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[00:58:08.401 --> 00:58:09.582]  So I'd rather give that money to
[00:58:09.682 --> 00:58:11.063]  Let me break this down for you.
[00:58:11.083 --> 00:58:12.484]  I've never really done marketing, but I did
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:35.042]  Bring in a few advertising people a few years ago who knew how to advertise online.
[00:58:35.062 --> 00:58:37.563]  And they said, Mr. Jones, they said, what's your markup?
[00:58:37.683 --> 00:58:40.144]  And I said, 150%, but we always discount 25%.
[00:58:41.104 --> 00:58:41.364]  So that's 100%.
[00:58:41.404 --> 00:58:42.785]  And they said, yeah.
[00:58:42.925 --> 00:58:44.126]  And then you're always discounting 20, 30%.
[00:58:44.266 --> 00:58:46.967]  And then we notice you only sell stuff when it's at 50%.
[00:58:47.807 --> 00:58:49.268]  And then you're barely making any money.
[00:58:49.428 --> 00:58:50.588]  You need to stop that.
[00:58:50.688 --> 00:58:53.689]  And they looked at our data and they said, oh, your audience would buy it if it was even more.
[00:58:53.709 --> 00:58:55.450]  And I said, I want high quality stuff in there.
[00:58:55.890 --> 00:58:56.691]  I want a good price.
[00:58:57.211 --> 00:59:02.893]  But I've kind of habituated everybody, trained everybody, myself done this, to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[00:59:03.073 --> 00:59:05.174]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off.
[00:59:05.194 --> 00:59:08.195]  Because there's no fillers, it's concentrated, it's got iodine, a little silver.
[00:59:08.396 --> 00:59:11.857]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[00:59:11.977 --> 00:59:18.463]  I mean, DNA Force, I signed a multi-year contract on that, so I was able to cut the price about 40% of what we were paying.
[00:59:18.603 --> 00:59:21.486]  It's still got 30-something dollars of product in it.
[00:59:21.566 --> 00:59:26.431]  I mean, you talk about cleaning your cells out, you talk about energy stamina, you talk about letting the telomeres last longer.
[00:59:26.551 --> 00:59:31.336]  This is patented to do that, and nobody puts this much of the real organic stuff in it.
[00:59:31.476 --> 00:59:33.257]  So yes, DNA Force is amazing.
[00:59:33.397 --> 00:59:34.337]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[00:59:34.357 --> 00:59:38.460]  But listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:47.064]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, and then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[00:59:47.084 --> 00:59:47.664]  But that's okay.
[00:59:47.724 --> 00:59:48.345]  Thanks for the support.
[00:59:56.485 --> 01:00:14.532]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:15.453 --> 01:00:19.414]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:00:19.994 --> 01:00:21.335]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.166 --> 01:00:29.486]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back.
[01:00:29.607 --> 01:00:31.147]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[01:00:31.347 --> 01:00:32.468]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.688 --> 01:00:49.994]  And some stations don't carry this five minutes, so I want to come back, start the next segment, and get into the tragic shooting in Odessa, which is getting more coverage than the giant magnitude 5.0 earthquake that hit Alaska, or the
[01:00:52.199 --> 01:00:54.101]  Type 5 hurricane at the same time.
[01:00:54.981 --> 01:01:00.306]  Dorian that's also bearing down on the East Coast, which could potentially kill thousands of people.
[01:01:01.066 --> 01:01:07.992]  But again, it was Stalin that said, 10,000 men die.
[01:01:08.072 --> 01:01:08.892]  It's a statistic.
[01:01:09.053 --> 01:01:09.833]  One man dies.
[01:01:09.993 --> 01:01:10.614]  It's a tragedy.
[01:01:12.346 --> 01:01:13.627]  Because it personalizes it.
[01:01:13.647 --> 01:01:22.014]  You see, they don't personalize the millions of babies that get aborted every year before they're born, or the tens of thousands that are kept alive now and harvested.
[01:01:23.075 --> 01:01:23.675]  They don't do that.
[01:01:24.516 --> 01:01:25.377]  They don't humanize them.
[01:01:26.798 --> 01:01:36.526]  But when they want to humanize somebody like John McCain, boy, do they make that corrupt Keating 5 gangster thug look great, or George Herbert Walker Bush, the New World Order anti-gun piece of crap.
[01:01:38.339 --> 01:01:46.182]  So we've got quite an hour lined up for you, because I'm going to go through all this and finish up on that, and then I'm going to get to the geopolitical developments, the huge developments with Joe Biden.
[01:01:46.222 --> 01:01:47.823]  I told you he's not going to make it to the race.
[01:01:48.243 --> 01:01:50.184]  I told you that first three months ago.
[01:01:50.424 --> 01:01:51.244]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:01:51.944 --> 01:01:53.145]  I'm not bragging, folks.
[01:01:53.465 --> 01:01:57.467]  You can assess somebody and tell you whether they can make it or whether they can't make it.
[01:01:57.867 --> 01:02:00.968]  But you did hear it here first, because I'm not a follower, you see.
[01:02:02.179 --> 01:02:08.925]  And that's the answer is not being a bunch of damn followers that just regurgitate what the establishment puts out, but your own research.
[01:02:09.746 --> 01:02:17.092]  Speaking of that, we were amongst the first to expose in 2004 that Google was using microphones in your computer to listen to you.
[01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:25.720]  And now it's come out this week that they put spy tech on it to watch and listen to you even when you turn it off, even when you say you don't want those cookies turned on, even when you disable that.
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.982]  And it's mainstream news.
[01:02:29.428 --> 01:02:38.194]  While even the Associated Press and Yahoo Finance tells you, Apple and Google are all listening to you and watching you, even when you don't want them to.
[01:02:38.774 --> 01:02:41.216]  And they're selling the data, and the Chinese government's doing it too.
[01:02:41.496 --> 01:02:45.319]  See, all this stuff's mainstream news now.
[01:02:46.219 --> 01:02:47.480]  It's all mainstream news.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:58.527]  Speaking of dehumanization and not valuing humans, here's a piece where we get into the fact that this is like a six-year-old piece, five-year-old piece, where they're heating hospitals with the dead bodies of children.
[01:02:58.868 --> 01:02:59.188]  Here it is.
[01:03:06.781 --> 01:03:11.024]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals.
[01:03:12.265 --> 01:03:16.167]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[01:03:16.447 --> 01:03:22.672]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[01:03:22.692 --> 01:03:27.495]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:03:28.015 --> 01:03:32.658]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[01:03:32.698 --> 01:03:34.740]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:37.361]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:03:37.842 --> 01:03:41.965]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[01:03:42.685 --> 01:03:45.387]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[01:03:45.687 --> 01:03:48.769]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:50.911]  You must evacuate the area.
[01:03:53.541 --> 01:04:05.406]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[01:04:06.066 --> 01:04:07.987]  So, enjoy the flavor!
[01:04:08.047 --> 01:04:12.508]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death penalties and sales taxes.
[01:04:12.688 --> 01:04:14.209]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[01:04:14.649 --> 01:04:16.150]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:17.770]  I'm for regular suicide.
[01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:19.431]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:04:19.751 --> 01:04:31.038]  ...is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[01:04:31.078 --> 01:04:35.221]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:04:35.461 --> 01:04:41.825]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[01:04:49.958 --> 01:04:52.142]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:04:52.563 --> 01:04:56.990]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:04:57.471 --> 01:04:59.234]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:05:04.071 --> 01:05:09.055]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:05:09.275 --> 01:05:16.841]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:05:17.841 --> 01:05:20.423]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:05:20.844 --> 01:05:22.185]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:05:22.565 --> 01:05:28.850]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:05:30.931 --> 01:05:35.834]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:05:36.254 --> 01:05:39.175]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:05:39.215 --> 01:05:42.817]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:05:42.837 --> 01:05:46.699]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:05:47.119 --> 01:05:48.820]  I've got two in my home.
[01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:54.563]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:05:55.043 --> 01:05:55.884]  Don't live
[01:05:56.724 --> 01:06:00.428]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[01:06:00.768 --> 01:06:02.049]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:15.142 --> 01:06:21.367]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:47.588]  The global corporations that are setting up a planetary world government are basically to accompany the most psychopathic, sociopathic, cold-blooded, robotic, reptilian-type autocrats you could really imagine.
[01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:52.030]  And they are selling the post-human world.
[01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:54.691]  They're saying everybody's obsolete.
[01:06:55.913 --> 01:07:06.056]  And then they're greasing the skids to make us as immoral and decadent and dumb and lazy and shallow as we can be.
[01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:08.857]  To have a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[01:07:10.858 --> 01:07:14.379]  Because when you have an industrialized world, and when people
[01:07:15.552 --> 01:07:21.097]  Even the poorest people can live better than kings did a thousand years ago.
[01:07:21.717 --> 01:07:25.581]  You're going to have a lot of people who are going to become lazy, decadent slobs.
[01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:38.472]  It was the French historian, philosopher, statesman Victor Hugo that said, adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[01:07:40.771 --> 01:07:42.912]  Adversity makes men, prosperity makes monsters.
[01:07:43.772 --> 01:07:58.756]  And it really is true that anyone that's seen somebody set a company up, say a grandfather, who did it by the bootstraps, and then you see the children that take over the company, they're a little more lazy, a little more decadent.
[01:07:59.296 --> 01:08:08.699]  By the time you get to their grandchildren, on average, you're dealing with completely lazy, disconnected, stupid, hedonist.
[01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:10.939]  On average.
[01:08:11.719 --> 01:08:12.180]  On average.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:33.625]  And then you take that evil, corrupt people come in to those power structures, who are first generation, but they're corrupt, and then they manipulate those corrupt elites that actually built things, and then the really evil people take over, and then you get a V.I.
[01:08:33.645 --> 01:08:36.806]  Lennon, then you get an Adolf Hitler, then you get a Mao Zedong.
[01:08:37.806 --> 01:08:39.347]  And then you've got a big problem.
[01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:41.868]  And then hundreds of millions of people died.
[01:08:44.090 --> 01:09:06.609]  And so what I'm getting at here is that the mainstream media does not give a rat's ass about the 17 people that got wounded and the 6 that died, 7 including the shooter in Odessa.
[01:09:08.823 --> 01:09:11.785]  I mean, Zbigniew Brzezinski wanted all the guns taken from the American people.
[01:09:11.845 --> 01:09:15.828]  His daughter wants them all taken on MSNBC with her psycho joke husband.
[01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:20.091]  He was found with a dead intern in his office, but it's okay because he's above the law.
[01:09:20.111 --> 01:09:36.503]  Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in a couple of his books bragging about how he helped put Pol Pot in and how Pol Pot exterminated everybody.
[01:09:38.905 --> 01:09:43.072]  And how that was used to destabilize Vietnam via Cambodia.
[01:09:43.833 --> 01:09:47.459]  And how he's a master tactician because he got them all to kill each other.
[01:09:50.004 --> 01:09:50.665]  Pretty evil, huh?
[01:09:53.052 --> 01:10:02.198]  He's the guy that tricked the Russians into invading Afghanistan by funding the Mujahideen in 1979 to attack the Russian underbelly first.
[01:10:02.218 --> 01:10:04.059]  I'm not lionizing the Soviet Russians.
[01:10:04.519 --> 01:10:09.383]  But you don't do something more evil than they would do to then beat them and then say you're still the good guy.
[01:10:09.803 --> 01:10:11.124]  So Brzezinski wanted your guns.
[01:10:11.144 --> 01:10:12.084]  He died a couple years ago.
[01:10:13.865 --> 01:10:16.447]  But he'd fund mass murder and would set it up.
[01:10:16.687 --> 01:10:19.069]  It killed 30% of the population of Cambodia.
[01:10:20.578 --> 01:10:22.318]  These people don't care about you.
[01:10:22.398 --> 01:10:36.042]  Mainstream media would promote Oxycontin and Fentanyl until Trump got in, and we've seen a tenfold increase, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the FDA and the DEA, of the amount of opioid abuse.
[01:10:36.402 --> 01:10:43.184]  You can't swing a stick and not hit somebody that's died from it, or is dying from it, or has been, you know, ruined their life on it.
[01:10:43.524 --> 01:10:44.544]  It's just an epidemic.
[01:10:45.165 --> 01:10:45.945]  It's all over the place.
[01:10:45.985 --> 01:10:46.885]  It touches everybody.
[01:10:46.905 --> 01:10:47.905]  It touches me.
[01:10:48.445 --> 01:10:49.426]  I hate this stuff.
[01:10:49.446 --> 01:10:50.326]  I can't even take it.
[01:10:52.159 --> 01:10:53.220]  But it's touched me.
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.142]  I know people, very close, this has happened to.
[01:10:57.724 --> 01:11:12.776]  So when they wave the bloody shirt and say, you as gun owners are guilty, you need to understand that your right to own guns caused this guy to go kill six people and caused the other Antifa psychopath to go kill 20 people at the Walmart.
[01:11:13.516 --> 01:11:16.359]  And he was Antifa on his social media.
[01:11:16.419 --> 01:11:18.821]  They took it down and said he was a Trump supporter.
[01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:22.011]  The other guy they didn't take down in time.
[01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:29.216]  He was Antifa, and a devil worshipper, and into pedophilia, because they always are.
[01:11:30.236 --> 01:11:34.739]  It's always some weird crazy-eyed guy in a black outfit who wants to go see the devil.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.482]  And he told everybody at the school, I'm gonna kill everybody.
[01:11:39.002 --> 01:11:40.963]  And the police were called, and nothing was done.
[01:11:41.204 --> 01:11:44.566]  Just like the shooter last year.
[01:11:46.485 --> 01:11:49.066]  On Valentine's Day, who'd been kicked out of school for six months.
[01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:57.148]  Cruz, who got to commit all these crimes because there was a liberal law passed that if you're a minority, you get to commit all these crimes and not go to jail.
[01:11:58.589 --> 01:11:59.509]  He wasn't even Hispanic.
[01:12:01.049 --> 01:12:03.150]  He was adopted by people that were Hispanic.
[01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:09.859]  Because his name was Cruz, he didn't go to jail for vandalism and robbery.
[01:12:09.879 --> 01:12:14.682]  He threatened to kill people and had the police called on him 44 times!
[01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:16.664]  He was known as School Shooter.
[01:12:17.204 --> 01:12:20.766]  He walked around going, bang bang, you're dead, I'm gonna kill you to good looking girls.
[01:12:22.227 --> 01:12:28.612]  Let's pull up the image of the Parkland, Florida shooter, please.
[01:12:29.192 --> 01:12:33.455]  When he was arrested, those crazy eyes, just like the eyes of all the other shooters.
[01:12:35.981 --> 01:12:37.121]  They're demon possessed, folks.
[01:12:37.402 --> 01:12:43.784]  They're told by the media that hypes up mass shootings since 1999 with Harrison Kleibold that go out and kill people and you'll be famous.
[01:12:44.024 --> 01:12:45.184]  And there's big studies out.
[01:12:45.224 --> 01:12:45.885]  Just type it in.
[01:12:46.385 --> 01:12:53.468]  Studies show media intense coverage of mass shooters makes them do it.
[01:12:53.768 --> 01:12:54.828]  People say, well, why are you doing it?
[01:12:55.128 --> 01:12:58.029]  Because we have to counter what they're doing and tell them to stop it.
[01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:02.211]  Oh, you don't see any mainstream media telling you of all the studies.
[01:13:07.995 --> 01:13:08.875]  Talk about crazy eyes.
[01:13:09.276 --> 01:13:11.056]  Just pull up him being arrested.
[01:13:11.096 --> 01:13:11.756]  That's his mugshot.
[01:13:11.797 --> 01:13:16.098]  Pull up Parkland shooters being arrested, being apprehended.
[01:13:16.618 --> 01:13:21.160]  You'll see him looking up like this desperate zombie, just like all the others.
[01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:35.306]  And so because there's all these crazy zombie people, we're then supposed to give our guns over so we can live like Chicago that has 2,000 plus deaths a year.
[01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:40.012]  Or Baltimore that's got 1,500 deaths a year.
[01:13:40.772 --> 01:13:47.175]  Or all the other places that have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 times the average.
[01:13:47.415 --> 01:13:53.698]  Last time I checked, Chicago has 14 times the average homicide rate of the United States.
[01:13:56.419 --> 01:13:58.600]  Because they take the guns.
[01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:00.981]  And then all the people that have them are criminals.
[01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:02.182]  And I know our audience knows this.
[01:14:03.663 --> 01:14:04.623]  They put this idea out.
[01:14:04.803 --> 01:14:05.884]  Something must be done.
[01:14:05.924 --> 01:14:08.705]  We must never have another mass shooting.
[01:14:10.745 --> 01:14:11.706]  You heard Beto earlier.
[01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:17.668]  He said there are 300 mass shootings a year.
[01:14:19.569 --> 01:14:23.110]  They count if more than one person shot as a mass shooting.
[01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:30.532]  On average, we've had Professor Lott and other top statisticians.
[01:14:30.552 --> 01:14:31.913]  I mean, he's one of the top guys in the world.
[01:14:34.309 --> 01:14:43.215]  And when I had him on like two years ago, the average was 57 people killed in real school mass shootings.
[01:14:46.718 --> 01:14:48.919]  And if you add all the other businesses and things, it was a little over 100.
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:51.521]  So it's gone up some now.
[01:14:51.822 --> 01:14:52.822]  I've tried to put the numbers together.
[01:14:52.842 --> 01:14:56.825]  I think it's like about 115 right now this year.
[01:14:56.985 --> 01:14:57.906]  That's still terrible.
[01:15:00.026 --> 01:15:03.509]  But again, 3,000 plus people have died already this year in Texas on the highways.
[01:15:04.169 --> 01:15:06.771]  If you believe the big highway signs that tell you, the big flashing signs.
[01:15:08.032 --> 01:15:09.053]  And I know it's probably above that.
[01:15:10.674 --> 01:15:11.455]  Again, is that okay?
[01:15:11.495 --> 01:15:11.735]  No!
[01:15:11.835 --> 01:15:13.116]  But we're still going to drive our cars.
[01:15:13.636 --> 01:15:20.421]  Just because somebody wrecks a car, is drunk in a car, runs over somebody in a car because they're ISIS, I don't lose my car.
[01:15:20.441 --> 01:15:23.764]  I don't lose my right to drive because somebody else is bad.
[01:15:25.711 --> 01:15:31.877]  There are over 10,000 people a year that get beaten to death with things like baseball bats and clubs.
[01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:33.338]  Look at the numbers.
[01:15:33.438 --> 01:15:36.321]  You don't say, don't let baseball teams have baseball bats.
[01:15:36.361 --> 01:15:37.362]  Don't let people have butcher knives.
[01:15:37.623 --> 01:15:40.946]  This woman stabbed this little kid in the face for no reason in Georgia last week with a butcher knife.
[01:15:41.686 --> 01:15:43.168]  Do we take all our butcher knives away?
[01:15:43.428 --> 01:15:45.150]  In England, they're making you get a license for one.
[01:15:47.088 --> 01:15:48.009]  So it's happening, folks.
[01:15:48.029 --> 01:15:55.212]  They're trying to blame the general public for something that's still incredibly rare, but the media hypes up and creates the perception of this epidemic.
[01:15:55.232 --> 01:15:56.353]  We have to get the truth out about that.
[01:15:57.053 --> 01:16:00.455]  The answer, though, to senseless violence that is increasing is to defend yourself.
[01:16:03.696 --> 01:16:07.458]  We have a new product line-in that I'm extremely excited about.
[01:16:07.578 --> 01:16:08.359]  Everybody knows that
[01:16:10.737 --> 01:16:14.461]  Super Silver is the strongest over-the-counter, FDA approved for over-the-counter sale.
[01:16:15.222 --> 01:16:16.083]  Silver there is.
[01:16:16.103 --> 01:16:17.805]  It's used in medical clinics.
[01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:18.766]  It's used in hospitals.
[01:16:19.426 --> 01:16:20.167]  It's for wounds.
[01:16:20.207 --> 01:16:23.050]  A little pea-sized amount of it is like a shield on your skin.
[01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:24.111]  It's amazing.
[01:16:24.352 --> 01:16:25.153]  Everybody needs it.
[01:16:25.313 --> 01:16:27.395]  Once you've been wounded, once you've got a scratch or a
[01:16:27.415 --> 01:16:27.735]  A little bit.
[01:16:46.474 --> 01:16:47.474]  Well, that's what we got them to do.
[01:16:47.534 --> 01:16:48.315]  The same big company.
[01:16:48.395 --> 01:16:49.535]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[01:16:49.595 --> 01:16:50.255]  I've been so busy.
[01:16:50.375 --> 01:16:52.856]  I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:55.017]  But it's very exciting from the same company.
[01:16:55.097 --> 01:16:55.797]  But it's new.
[01:16:55.937 --> 01:16:57.578]  Working with another big skin care company.
[01:16:57.758 --> 01:16:59.078]  They're producing it in their factory.
[01:16:59.239 --> 01:17:01.459]  It's super silver skin cream.
[01:17:01.599 --> 01:17:03.660]  And so it's got all of these benefits.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.760]  Too many to mention.
[01:17:04.801 --> 01:17:05.901]  But it's revolutionary.
[01:17:06.081 --> 01:17:06.901]  It's brand new.
[01:17:07.021 --> 01:17:07.802]  People are going to love it.
[01:17:07.862 --> 01:17:09.882]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream.

[01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:25.991]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[01:17:26.111 --> 01:17:31.034]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.

[01:17:58.553 --> 01:17:59.634]  We're going to get started.
[01:17:59.654 --> 01:18:00.434]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:00.454 --> 01:18:01.415]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:01.455 --> 01:18:02.756]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:02.916 --> 01:18:03.636]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:03.656 --> 01:18:04.617]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:04.637 --> 01:18:05.177]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:05.198 --> 01:18:06.298]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:06.318 --> 01:18:07.179]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:07.219 --> 01:18:08.000]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:08.760]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:09.441]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:09.481 --> 01:18:10.221]  We're going to get started.
[01:18:10.361 --> 01:18:11.122]  We're going to get started
[01:18:11.522 --> 01:18:14.264]  Want to get this for yourself for external use only.
[01:18:14.384 --> 01:18:16.526]  And we've got it in the straight no scent.
[01:18:16.546 --> 01:18:17.326]  It's not really a scent.
[01:18:17.346 --> 01:18:17.887]  It's natural.
[01:18:17.987 --> 01:18:19.708]  And we've also got it with the grapefruit.
[01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:20.829]  It's also got all those added.
[01:18:21.069 --> 01:18:22.130]  We have little tubes of it.
[01:18:22.150 --> 01:18:23.071]  We have big tubes of it.
[01:18:23.271 --> 01:18:24.432]  And it's a great deal.
[01:18:24.532 --> 01:18:27.834]  Again, $7.45 for the little one.
[01:18:28.114 --> 01:18:32.658]  And if you get the big ones, you get an even better deal for the amount that you get $14.95.
[01:18:32.698 --> 01:18:33.318]  And I can tell you,
[01:18:34.699 --> 01:18:37.021]  Similar brands sold in stores that don't have the silver.
[01:18:37.161 --> 01:18:38.402]  Retail for $25.
[01:18:38.462 --> 01:18:38.762]  Sell for $19.95.
[01:18:39.583 --> 01:18:41.084]  So this is even better at $14.95.
[01:18:41.724 --> 01:18:42.765]  That is a really good deal.
[01:18:42.905 --> 01:18:45.387]  So this is a whole new enchilada.
[01:18:45.807 --> 01:18:47.008]  It's a whole new world.
[01:18:47.028 --> 01:18:51.552]  And I believe it's going to end up being a national bestseller, not just here.
[01:18:51.592 --> 01:18:54.854]  And I believe it's going to fund us into taking the country and the world back.
[01:18:54.874 --> 01:18:55.795]  So please, check it out.
[01:18:55.835 --> 01:18:57.816]  The new products at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:19:02.776 --> 01:19:04.737]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[01:19:05.137 --> 01:19:11.401]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[01:19:11.761 --> 01:19:15.724]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[01:19:16.224 --> 01:19:22.228]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development, this formula uses wild anchovy fish oil,
[01:19:22.708 --> 01:19:28.751]  Ultra-purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[01:19:29.191 --> 01:19:40.716]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive, and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's brain growth spurts.
[01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:50.440]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:54.801]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.

[01:20:05.464 --> 01:20:11.386]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:20.902 --> 01:20:21.862]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:20:21.922 --> 01:20:22.622]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:20:22.642 --> 01:20:25.603]  We're live, broadcasting worldwide on a Sunday.
[01:20:25.923 --> 01:20:26.923]  First day of September, 2019.
[01:20:27.484 --> 01:20:30.084]  Can you believe we're about to hit 2020?
[01:20:30.144 --> 01:20:32.405]  Hitler took the guns.
[01:20:32.425 --> 01:20:34.165]  Stalin took the guns.
[01:20:34.185 --> 01:20:35.185]  Mao took the guns.
[01:20:35.225 --> 01:20:37.386]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[01:20:37.426 --> 01:20:42.087]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[01:20:50.192 --> 01:20:53.556]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[01:20:55.638 --> 01:20:58.661]  The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.
[01:20:58.762 --> 01:21:09.494]  I am sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny of the mind of man.
[01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:09.974]  Boom!
[01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:13.309]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:21:13.389 --> 01:21:15.612]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:24.252 --> 01:21:36.034]  Well, Beto O'Rourke, when he's not giggling and laughing about the dead people in El Paso, is out saying it's effing time to register your guns and then confiscate all the semi-autos.
[01:21:36.754 --> 01:21:37.634]  That's what he's saying.
[01:21:37.654 --> 01:21:38.975]  Remember back when they used to deny that?
[01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:47.836]  But their own internal Brady campaign and the Soros-funded groups and Bloomberg, their internal documents would come out.
[01:21:48.476 --> 01:21:51.297]  They'd say, our plan is a civilian disarmament.
[01:21:52.076 --> 01:21:53.757]  And they signed on to the U.N.
[01:21:53.817 --> 01:22:16.446]  Treaty, Bill Clinton did, but never got ratified, and Bush almost passed it in 2001, the UNIDIR, United Nations Small Arms Convention, and it said right there in the treaty that never got passed by Congress, civilian firearms ownership threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:20.308]  That's a totally true statement, except for one word, legitimate.
[01:22:21.087 --> 01:22:22.228]  Let's take the word legitimate out.
[01:22:22.708 --> 01:22:28.371]  Civilian ownership of firearms threatens the power monopoly of the state.
[01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:30.453]  Power monopoly.
[01:22:31.173 --> 01:22:31.473]  Turing.
[01:22:32.294 --> 01:22:32.854]  Mao Zedong.
[01:22:33.394 --> 01:22:33.735]  Hitler.
[01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:34.455]  Stalin.
[01:22:34.915 --> 01:22:35.156]  Mao.
[01:22:36.016 --> 01:22:36.416]  Pol Pot.
[01:22:36.737 --> 01:22:37.257]  Fidel Castro.
[01:22:37.757 --> 01:22:38.297]  Hugo Chavez.
[01:22:40.199 --> 01:22:41.860]  Mexico, only the government has the guns.
[01:22:43.701 --> 01:22:44.861]  And the cartels and the lawless.
[01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:48.664]  Once you do that, you have the lawless government, the lawless criminals.
[01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.565]  Because slaves are disarmed.
[01:22:53.055 --> 01:22:56.718]  And so you bet I'm harping on it this Sunday, because there's going to be more mass shootings in this country.
[01:22:56.738 --> 01:23:00.762]  There's going to be more stabbings, more bombings, more people running over folks.
[01:23:02.063 --> 01:23:05.687]  Because it's true that we peaked crime-wise in 1991.
[01:23:06.087 --> 01:23:08.109]  The FBI has these numbers.
[01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.731]  The 80s was hell.
[01:23:09.851 --> 01:23:10.611]  Early 90s were bad.
[01:23:10.631 --> 01:23:17.598]  I remember when I was growing up in Dallas, when it was the murder capital of the United States above Chicago, where there'd be up to 20 murders
[01:23:19.591 --> 01:23:20.612]  In one day, sometimes.
[01:23:21.452 --> 01:23:22.293]  In South Dallas.
[01:23:22.853 --> 01:23:23.294]  Drug-related.
[01:23:24.535 --> 01:23:30.479]  No one thought, hey, let's turn our guns in, because ten miles away, drug dealers are killing each other in a turf war.
[01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:35.963]  It's like Mexico has hundreds of thousands dead the last decade in their drug war.
[01:23:36.823 --> 01:23:37.684]  Many of them innocent people.
[01:23:37.884 --> 01:23:41.027]  Do we go, oh, let's turn our guns in, because there's criminals in Mexico!
[01:23:41.067 --> 01:23:41.727]  We'll be safe!
[01:23:42.287 --> 01:23:42.888]  It's asinine!
[01:23:44.929 --> 01:23:48.092]  You create an atmosphere for incredible
[01:23:49.212 --> 01:23:49.632]  Crime.
[01:23:50.472 --> 01:23:51.432]  When you take the guns.
[01:23:52.733 --> 01:23:56.133]  Unless you're domesticated Europe, where they had almost no crime.
[01:23:56.833 --> 01:23:58.334]  England was one of the safest places in the world.
[01:23:58.674 --> 01:24:02.255]  The British police, the Bobbies, didn't carry weapons.
[01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:04.835]  They carry machine guns now.
[01:24:05.855 --> 01:24:08.876]  Because they brought in people from countries where everybody's killing each other.
[01:24:10.296 --> 01:24:10.916]  The Middle East.
[01:24:11.616 --> 01:24:12.777]  Dangerous areas of Asia.
[01:24:13.617 --> 01:24:14.897]  Dangerous areas of Eastern Europe.
[01:24:16.983 --> 01:24:20.326]  And now they have a higher crime rate in England than we have here on average.
[01:24:21.967 --> 01:24:23.669]  Oh, people aren't getting shot to death, mainly.
[01:24:23.689 --> 01:24:24.649]  They're getting stabbed to death.
[01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:26.931]  Every few hours, in London alone.
[01:24:27.612 --> 01:24:28.232]  Acid attacks.
[01:24:29.453 --> 01:24:31.755]  But again, the establishment knows they're not always going to have bodyguards.
[01:24:32.056 --> 01:24:33.357]  They're going to live behind armored walls.
[01:24:34.798 --> 01:24:37.880]  They want the general public disarmed for total control.
[01:24:39.302 --> 01:24:41.083]  And I know, as an audience, you understand that.
[01:24:41.103 --> 01:24:42.925]  I know, as an audience, you get all of that.
[01:24:43.905 --> 01:24:46.006]  But that's where the Democrats say they're going.
[01:24:46.026 --> 01:24:51.389]  I mean, the New York Times this year, they've all come out and said, time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:24:54.090 --> 01:24:57.252]  That's how 1776 started when the British came to take the guns.
[01:24:58.192 --> 01:25:00.573]  At Lexington, at Concord, at Bunker Hill.
[01:25:01.554 --> 01:25:03.354]  And again, I know this audience knows that.
[01:25:05.896 --> 01:25:12.319]  But coming up next segment, I've got articles right here where they're already confiscating
[01:25:13.857 --> 01:25:26.802]  Firearms under red flag laws in multiple states from people that say things like, if Antifa starts killing us and coming to our houses to kill us, like I've said, we'll have to fight back.
[01:25:27.042 --> 01:25:28.222]  Well, I said that last year.
[01:25:28.522 --> 01:25:29.343]  I was banned from Twitter.
[01:25:29.583 --> 01:25:30.543]  They were going to people's houses.
[01:25:30.563 --> 01:25:32.004]  So they're going to kill people.
[01:25:32.324 --> 01:25:33.364]  They already shot Scalise.
[01:25:33.684 --> 01:25:35.445]  They already broke the ribs of Rand Paul.
[01:25:36.045 --> 01:25:38.166]  Antifa said we're going to go to Tucker Carlson's house.
[01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:39.586]  Said we're going to kill you?
[01:25:39.966 --> 01:25:43.227]  And I said, hey, if you're on Antifa's list, you better have a gun to protect yourself.
[01:25:43.587 --> 01:25:46.348]  And the news said Jones threatens to kill reporters.
[01:25:46.868 --> 01:25:47.728]  Where was the video?
[01:25:48.068 --> 01:25:48.848]  Where was the audio?
[01:25:50.189 --> 01:25:51.529]  But the media said that.
[01:25:52.069 --> 01:25:54.050]  Under red flag laws, I would be disarmed.
[01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:56.350]  You read what these people have in their guns taken said?
[01:25:57.550 --> 01:25:58.271]  They said what I said.
[01:26:00.671 --> 01:26:06.673]  They didn't go as far as Thomas Jefferson that said the tree of liberty needs to be watered from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[01:26:06.853 --> 01:26:08.013]  Boy, he'd have been red flagged law.
[01:26:09.042 --> 01:26:11.043]  No, the red flag, we already have it on the books.
[01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:11.983]  We already have the process.
[01:26:12.583 --> 01:26:18.665]  People like Cruz said, 44 police reports, I'm gonna come kill or bite the school.
[01:26:20.246 --> 01:26:29.589]  Well, buddy boy, you get put in a mental institution or a prison for that, and the next time you get out and you say it, we give you a lobotomy.
[01:26:29.989 --> 01:26:30.569]  How's that sound?
[01:26:33.382 --> 01:26:34.043]  See how that works?
[01:26:35.123 --> 01:26:38.006]  See, Antifa's the ones out saying, kill people, shoot people.
[01:26:38.166 --> 01:26:40.808]  They're the ones with the John Brown Gun Club saying, let's go kill cops.
[01:26:41.008 --> 01:26:43.650]  There was another firebombing of another ICE facility today.
[01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:46.232]  You didn't hear about that because the media won't cover it.
[01:26:48.094 --> 01:26:52.717]  There was a black young man that went and shot a whole bunch of people.
[01:26:53.418 --> 01:26:57.942]  What, he wounded 10 people at a football game.
[01:26:58.959 --> 01:27:00.720]  You didn't even see that on the news, did you?
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.901]  Because it doesn't fit into the white supremacist narrative.
[01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:09.704]  What we've got is the beginning of a zombie apocalypse in this country with the breakdown of morals and people hearing, hey, it's an option.
[01:27:12.325 --> 01:27:17.547]  Let me just go out and shoot a bunch of people at a football game, mainly fellow black people.
[01:27:19.534 --> 01:27:35.386]  Because the truth is, whether it's the white guy killing his sister and his nephew, or his niece, and chewing on the greenskeeper, or it's the black lady biting the guy in Atlanta, or it's the crazy white guy in Texas shooting people, or the crazy black guy at the football game, it's not what color they are, and it's not the gun.
[01:27:36.807 --> 01:27:37.487]  It's evil.
[01:27:38.348 --> 01:27:39.129]  It's craziness.
[01:27:40.510 --> 01:27:45.874]  And it's that the media has hyped all this up as if it's an option, something you could do.
[01:27:47.435 --> 01:27:48.576]  Something you should do.
[01:27:49.753 --> 01:27:50.693]  Let's play Beto O'Rourke.
[01:27:50.713 --> 01:27:51.093]  Here he is.
[01:27:52.714 --> 01:27:56.674]  We're averaging about 300 mass shootings a year.
[01:27:57.134 --> 01:27:58.695]  No other country comes close.
[01:27:58.735 --> 01:28:00.175]  So, yes, this is f***ed up.
[01:28:00.495 --> 01:28:10.236]  And if we don't call it out for what it is, if we're not able to speak clearly, if we're not able to act decisively, then we will continue to have this kind of bloodshed in America.
[01:28:10.617 --> 01:28:11.717]  And I cannot accept that.
[01:28:11.837 --> 01:28:17.438]  And so we're going to speak as defiantly and as strongly as we can, but we're also going to take action.
[01:28:17.658 --> 01:28:18.798]  Universal background checks.
[01:28:19.278 --> 01:28:27.861]  Red Flag Laws, an end to the sales of weapons of war, and buying those AK-47s and AR-15s back so that they cannot be used against our fellow Americans.
[01:28:28.381 --> 01:28:30.061]  And oh, just take the AK-47s.
[01:28:30.082 --> 01:28:31.162]  AK-47s full auto.
[01:28:31.182 --> 01:28:32.662]  You can't even get that without a special deal.
[01:28:32.682 --> 01:28:33.263]  That's not even true.
[01:28:33.663 --> 01:28:35.203]  Full auto is never even used in crimes.
[01:28:35.543 --> 01:28:36.163]  He knows all that.
[01:28:36.484 --> 01:28:37.664]  But he's manipulating people.
[01:28:37.864 --> 01:28:41.525]  By the way, there are lots of countries that have millions killed routinely.
[01:28:41.845 --> 01:28:43.886]  It's just, oh, the government has the guns, they're doing the killing.
[01:28:44.266 --> 01:28:46.607]  Yeah, we're one of the only countries that has guns, jackass!
[01:28:47.307 --> 01:28:49.470]  Like Switzerland has the lowest crime rate in the world.
[01:28:50.511 --> 01:28:53.415]  That's why you can't go take control of it, you big, fat, dirty parasite.
[01:28:53.696 --> 01:28:54.757]  Beto the loser.
[01:28:55.058 --> 01:28:55.478]  O'Rourke.
[01:28:55.779 --> 01:28:56.900]  We'll be back with Critical Intel.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:58.362]  Stay with us.
[01:29:06.135 --> 01:29:07.556]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:08.396]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[01:29:08.416 --> 01:29:08.816]  You're on the air.
[01:29:08.956 --> 01:29:09.456]  Hey, Alex.
[01:29:09.576 --> 01:29:17.880]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer, and to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago, and I'm very thankful that I found you.
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.461]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[01:29:21.601 --> 01:29:22.802]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[01:29:22.862 --> 01:29:23.262]  Exactly.
[01:29:23.282 --> 01:29:24.303]  We're all kindred spirits.
[01:29:24.463 --> 01:29:25.024]  We really are.
[01:29:25.064 --> 01:29:25.484]  We really are.
[01:29:25.504 --> 01:29:27.165]  And listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[01:29:27.185 --> 01:29:29.827]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[01:29:29.988 --> 01:29:32.289]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[01:29:32.369 --> 01:29:33.390]  What would you recommend?
[01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:36.192]  I mean, literally, it's joints, it's muscle, it's everything.
[01:29:36.273 --> 01:29:38.054]  What would you recommend to me to purchase?
[01:29:38.074 --> 01:29:41.517]  You know, I think X2 or X3, because that's a building block to everything.
[01:29:41.537 --> 01:29:43.298]  And if you don't have that, the bad halogens take over.
[01:29:43.338 --> 01:29:45.560]  And I would think Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:46.881]  Turmeric is amazing.
[01:29:46.921 --> 01:29:48.422]  This is a very strong extract.
[01:29:48.522 --> 01:29:49.583]  One of the strongest out there.
[01:29:49.603 --> 01:29:50.964]  Probably the strongest, but there may be one stronger.
[01:29:53.098 --> 01:29:55.540]  I would think Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:59.682]  They've all bombarded us with synthetic hormones that mess up our body.
[01:29:59.763 --> 01:30:12.571]  But then, if you get Preglanone, in my experience, I'm no doctor, I just talk to the scientists, with these other herbs like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, I think you should go through the products, every body is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[01:30:12.611 --> 01:30:20.636]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest, just like whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[01:30:20.997 --> 01:30:21.317]  That's it.
[01:30:21.357 --> 01:30:22.798]  Because I would, I'm gonna say this again,
[01:30:23.258 --> 01:30:24.559]  I'm a very superstitious person.
[01:30:25.339 --> 01:30:26.320]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.281]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[01:30:28.301 --> 01:30:29.381]  You've got my total commitment.
[01:30:29.622 --> 01:30:36.625]  Anything I do, information, any of it, products, like they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[01:30:36.745 --> 01:30:38.106]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[01:30:38.126 --> 01:30:42.328]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have like the two best.
[01:30:42.628 --> 01:30:43.609]  Why'd I do that?
[01:30:43.749 --> 01:30:45.290]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[01:30:45.370 --> 01:30:48.591]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality.
[01:30:48.611 --> 01:30:51.833]  Because there's always like some space-age $5,000 thing that's better.
[01:30:51.933 --> 01:30:54.914]  But I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit?
[01:30:55.034 --> 01:30:56.335]  And that's what I promote.
[01:30:56.755 --> 01:30:58.216]  So that's my advice on that.
[01:30:58.316 --> 01:30:58.856]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:30:59.216 --> 01:31:05.559]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[01:31:05.619 --> 01:31:07.520]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:09.061]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[01:31:09.101 --> 01:31:16.305]  Well, now listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal, is you need to talk to a physician, you need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[01:31:16.525 --> 01:31:18.066]  Most people have almost none of it.
[01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:21.108]  But if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you can have some issues.
[01:31:21.268 --> 01:31:22.449]  Detoxing, you name it.
[01:31:22.489 --> 01:31:25.151]  I mean, this stuff, this is it, man.
[01:31:25.291 --> 01:31:26.692]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[01:31:26.853 --> 01:31:27.473]  It's dangerous.
[01:31:27.693 --> 01:31:30.355]  Because it's an element you've gotta have, they've taken away from you.
[01:31:30.455 --> 01:31:32.276]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[01:31:32.356 --> 01:31:32.997]  You gotta be careful.
[01:31:33.117 --> 01:31:36.918]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[01:31:37.018 --> 01:31:38.538]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[01:31:39.718 --> 01:31:41.239]  Your organs, everything operates.
[01:31:41.439 --> 01:31:43.599]  Your hormones are produced with halogen.
[01:31:43.719 --> 01:31:47.300]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:48.320]  So this is the good thing.
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.320]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched in the head by a mule.
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:52.601]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[01:31:52.661 --> 01:31:53.521]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:55.561]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[01:31:55.661 --> 01:31:57.342]  We just research what the globalists are doing.
[01:31:57.482 --> 01:31:58.262]  We do the opposite.
[01:31:58.302 --> 01:31:59.442]  But yes, everyone
[01:31:59.602 --> 01:32:03.945]  With X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[01:32:03.965 --> 01:32:05.046]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[01:32:05.166 --> 01:32:09.030]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, okay?
[01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:10.010]  So I'm gonna explain it again.
[01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:12.272]  Without iodine, you die.
[01:32:12.492 --> 01:32:13.733]  The fields are depleted.
[01:32:13.893 --> 01:32:14.674]  Everything's depleted.
[01:32:14.874 --> 01:32:20.379]  Most iodine is bound to iron or copper or lead or something else.
[01:32:20.439 --> 01:32:21.259]  You don't get it.
[01:32:21.359 --> 01:32:23.981]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[01:32:24.262 --> 01:32:25.262]  So yeah, be careful.
[01:32:25.423 --> 01:32:26.724]  Iodine, you have to have.
[01:32:27.444 --> 01:32:29.205]  It's just paramount.
[01:32:29.786 --> 01:32:31.647]  And so that's why we sell it.
[01:32:31.707 --> 01:32:35.229]  That's why we've hyped it up because it's what they don't want you to have.
[01:32:35.269 --> 01:32:41.874]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had iodine for your whole life, it's like you've never been in a boxing ring and you get the ring with Mike Tyson.
[01:32:41.914 --> 01:32:44.536]  Your body's gonna be like, what the hell is that?
[01:32:44.796 --> 01:32:46.077]  Because you've never had it.
[01:32:46.297 --> 01:32:47.197]  It's just iodine.
[01:32:47.257 --> 01:32:48.978]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[01:32:57.244 --> 01:33:01.867]  A little Lana Del Rey for you, folks.
[01:33:27.848 --> 01:33:35.371]  There's a lot of really selfish people out there.
[01:33:35.591 --> 01:33:42.174]  You know, suicide's always been a problem with humanity.
[01:33:42.234 --> 01:33:53.119]  But, it's also been known that a lot of evil people, when they go, they want to take people with them.
[01:33:55.219 --> 01:34:11.069]  And the fact that we are seeing an uptick in stabbings and stranglings and people literally trying to chew the flesh off folks' face shows that we've lost our soul to a certain extent.
[01:34:12.429 --> 01:34:14.391]  It shows that we're sliding towards the abyss.
[01:34:14.411 --> 01:34:15.631]  We've lost our moral compass.
[01:34:16.872 --> 01:34:18.113]  And then you look at these chemicals
[01:34:21.325 --> 01:34:30.628]  The serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the so-called antidepressants, they say on the bottles and with the inserts that this tends to massively increase megalomania.
[01:34:31.388 --> 01:34:33.889]  It tends to massively increase psychotic behavior.
[01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:39.591]  It tends to massively increase going out and committing murder.
[01:34:39.671 --> 01:34:42.452]  It actually says may cause mass murder.
[01:34:46.413 --> 01:34:47.954]  But when you see the ads for
[01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:54.352]  Antidepressants that something like 30% of the population's on.
[01:34:54.372 --> 01:34:55.613]  30% of women are on them.
[01:34:56.234 --> 01:34:57.334]  Something like 15% of men.
[01:34:58.035 --> 01:34:58.195]  Yeah.
[01:35:01.037 --> 01:35:02.138]  They don't tell you all that.
[01:35:04.339 --> 01:35:12.045]  I know a very well-known musician who I met through Mike Judge.
[01:35:12.125 --> 01:35:13.826]  He was an incredible musician in his own right.
[01:35:15.807 --> 01:35:17.729]  Not name-dropping, just to give you an idea.
[01:35:19.517 --> 01:35:30.299]  And he has that disease that Michael Jackson had where your skin turns totally white from the antidepressant he takes.
[01:35:32.180 --> 01:35:33.440]  He's got all these other health problems.
[01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:47.163]  He hasn't had any of it until he took the pills and they admit within two years of him taking those pills he looks like a vampire and he's got all these other health problems and he can't go off of it or he wants to kill himself.
[01:35:49.468 --> 01:35:55.090]  And he didn't go on it because he wanted to kill himself before, he just went on it because they just recommended it to him.
[01:35:59.512 --> 01:36:08.415]  And then you got enough fentanyl being captured at the border last week to kill 14 million people.
[01:36:10.476 --> 01:36:13.477]  Now there's a story behind that, and I'll get to that in a moment, but just remember,
[01:36:17.335 --> 01:36:23.237]  They are prescribing ten times the opioids that they were putting out just five years ago.
[01:36:24.557 --> 01:36:25.517]  That's a DEA number.
[01:36:26.538 --> 01:36:32.359]  Ten times the number of scripts these doctors are writing.
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.721]  And look, I get some people are in real pain and need the moderate opioids.
[01:36:38.181 --> 01:36:41.782]  I know some of you out there, you'll get them taken away from you.
[01:36:42.683 --> 01:36:44.223]  But then other people are killing themselves with it.
[01:36:47.110 --> 01:36:47.871]  But think about that.
[01:36:48.751 --> 01:36:52.013]  Fentanyl is a hundred times stronger than opium.
[01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:57.797]  They debate that ten times stronger than heroin, some say even stronger than that.
[01:36:59.778 --> 01:37:09.505]  And the developing powers, the European powers, divided China
[01:37:10.379 --> 01:37:13.862]  into seven parts, 12 parts, 14 parts at one point.
[01:37:13.882 --> 01:37:18.746]  You had the American zone, the French zone, the British zone, was obviously the coastline and most valuable.
[01:37:19.286 --> 01:37:25.051]  And they took over from the imperial Chinese because the Chinese said opium is illegal here.
[01:37:25.511 --> 01:37:26.972]  We'll kill you if you have it.
[01:37:27.372 --> 01:37:32.757]  But that created a black market so that the British would bring it in and first corrupt the coastlines
[01:37:34.053 --> 01:37:38.617]  That the police corrupt would ship it inland, and then you had all the Chinese laid out, smoking their opium.
[01:37:38.917 --> 01:37:45.443]  When they would come over here to America, they would just work all day on the railroad, and lay out and take their hit of opium in the opium dens.
[01:37:46.564 --> 01:37:55.952]  And there's estimated over a million and a half buried Chinese men that just came here for opium.
[01:37:56.912 --> 01:37:58.633]  And work themselves to death like slaves.
[01:37:59.354 --> 01:38:04.057]  One true thing about that show, Deadwood, it's based on a real town that HBO had, you know, years ago.
[01:38:04.077 --> 01:38:04.457]  I watched it.
[01:38:04.518 --> 01:38:05.278]  It was actually accurate.
[01:38:05.298 --> 01:38:08.560]  That's a real town that really... Well, most of that's historical.
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:09.141]  Some of it's not.
[01:38:09.821 --> 01:38:12.283]  Where they had the Chinese women having to service like 50 men a day.
[01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:16.526]  And when one of them got pregnant or got sick, they'd just feed them to pigs.
[01:38:19.709 --> 01:38:21.630]  That's the kind of human rights you got in China.
[01:38:21.670 --> 01:38:25.633]  And once it came over here, that's the type of human rights you have.
[01:38:27.130 --> 01:38:29.152]  And so that's what we're competing with, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:38:31.294 --> 01:38:33.236]  So the communists came along and just took all that over.
[01:38:33.276 --> 01:38:36.799]  So the Chinese now will execute you.
[01:38:37.059 --> 01:38:38.641]  Death penalty for any drugs.
[01:38:38.801 --> 01:38:39.942]  Marijuana, death penalty.
[01:38:40.222 --> 01:38:41.163]  Opium, death penalty.
[01:38:41.183 --> 01:38:42.084]  Same thing in Singapore.
[01:38:44.646 --> 01:38:52.174]  But they're shipping in illegal fentanyl and killing hundreds of thousands of Americans.
[01:38:53.186 --> 01:38:57.710]  The latest numbers are 2017, 53,000 people die from opiates.
[01:38:59.171 --> 01:39:01.633]  They think less than half ever get properly reported.
[01:39:01.893 --> 01:39:03.515]  So back then it was 100,000, let's say.
[01:39:04.415 --> 01:39:06.017]  Now they're saying it's 10 times the amount.
[01:39:06.077 --> 01:39:07.658]  They don't know the numbers of death.
[01:39:07.758 --> 01:39:08.919]  It's just epidemic.
[01:39:10.521 --> 01:39:11.361]  How many movie stars?
[01:39:11.421 --> 01:39:12.822]  How many baseball players?
[01:39:13.603 --> 01:39:15.525]  Every week you hear about somebody dying who's famous.
[01:39:16.872 --> 01:39:18.033]  Does anybody care about that?
[01:39:18.093 --> 01:39:19.153]  Yeah, President Trump does.
[01:39:19.333 --> 01:39:21.334]  And I'm not just here giving President Trump a brownie point.
[01:39:21.714 --> 01:39:27.297]  He's actually going after something that's killing people.
[01:39:29.778 --> 01:39:32.420]  He's actually doing something real, not just lip service.
[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:40.784]  Because, okay, a hundred and whatever plus people die a year in true mass shootings.
[01:39:41.944 --> 01:39:44.726]  Or somebody goes out to try to
[01:39:46.906 --> 01:39:48.146]  Kill a bunch of people for no reason.
[01:39:48.707 --> 01:39:54.328]  When Beto says there's over 300 mass shootings a year, most of those are gang-related, where you get three or four gang members shot.
[01:39:54.348 --> 01:40:01.131]  And that's still terrible, too, but that doesn't stand any comparison to all the other things we can do something about.
[01:40:01.551 --> 01:40:04.352]  Enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people?
[01:40:04.372 --> 01:40:05.272]  We'll play that report in a moment.
[01:40:05.492 --> 01:40:09.653]  But first, here's Beto O'Rourke, slowed down for radio and TV viewers a month ago.
[01:40:10.234 --> 01:40:14.495]  Couldn't contain his sickening, demonic laughing when he talked about
[01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:21.428]  The psychotic antifa that went into that Walmart, that mall in El Paso.
[01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:21.849]  Here it is.
[01:40:22.689 --> 01:40:26.253]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[01:40:29.736 --> 01:40:33.240]  I'm incredibly saddened and it is very hard to think about this.
[01:40:40.027 --> 01:40:45.931]  But I'll tell you, El Paso is the strongest place in the world.
[01:40:45.951 --> 01:40:54.117]  There's a lot of injury, a lot of suffering in El Paso right now.
[01:40:56.759 --> 01:40:58.640]  I'm incredibly saddened.
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.281]  It's very hard to think about this.
[01:41:01.602 --> 01:41:02.403]  Then he starts laughing.
[01:41:02.923 --> 01:41:05.685]  I thought we'd slow that clip down, but tomorrow I'll slow it down.
[01:41:05.845 --> 01:41:06.986]  I'm going to be here live now.
[01:41:07.386 --> 01:41:08.127]  I'm coming in tomorrow.
[01:41:09.298 --> 01:41:11.260]  And I'm going to do, you know, four hours here at least.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:12.300]  I may even do war room too.
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:13.521]  Everybody deserves some time off.
[01:41:13.701 --> 01:41:16.464]  In fact, we'll just have a skeleton crew who wants to come and volunteer because I'm going to be here.
[01:41:16.984 --> 01:41:18.305]  Because we've got to fight, folks.
[01:41:18.325 --> 01:41:19.606]  We just can't give up here.
[01:41:19.626 --> 01:41:22.929]  We're going to go out to break with this CBS News report.
[01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:28.153]  Enough fentanyl seized coming into the United States.
[01:41:29.894 --> 01:41:30.975]  What they call a land port.
[01:41:32.495 --> 01:41:34.938]  Mexico, but they don't want to land port into the U.S.
[01:41:35.599 --> 01:41:36.400]  It's coming to the U.S.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.743]  bound to kill 14 million people.
[01:41:38.803 --> 01:41:40.144]  Enough to kill 14 million people.
[01:41:40.164 --> 01:41:40.465]  Here it is.
[01:41:41.641 --> 01:41:45.303]  Investigators have busted a massive drug ring spanning three states.
[01:41:45.463 --> 01:41:47.304]  All this over just the last three days.
[01:41:47.404 --> 01:41:54.948]  Law enforcement officers in Virginia seized enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people as part of what they're calling Operation Cookout.
[01:41:55.269 --> 01:41:59.651]  There are 35 suspects that have been arrested, four others still on the run.
[01:41:59.751 --> 01:42:01.272]  Chip Reid is in Washington for us.
[01:42:01.312 --> 01:42:04.174]  Chip, what else did investigators seize in this bust?
[01:42:04.194 --> 01:42:04.574]  Good morning.
[01:42:05.114 --> 01:42:13.001]  Well, authorities say they seized about 66 pounds of fentanyl in addition to other illegal drugs and money amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:42:13.261 --> 01:42:17.385]  But the fentanyl, which is a synthetic opioid, had them especially concerned.
[01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:22.153]  This opioid crisis is not an issue that's happening someplace else or to someone else.
[01:42:22.534 --> 01:42:23.936]  It's happening right here in Norfolk.
[01:42:24.196 --> 01:42:29.703]  Announcing the largest drug takedown in Virginia in 15 years, G. Zachary Terwilliger, U.S.
[01:42:29.763 --> 01:42:34.829]  Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said most fentanyl comes from Chinese labs.
[01:42:35.470 --> 01:42:45.159]  In total, authorities seized over 30 kilograms of fentanyl, 30 kilograms of heroin, 5 kilograms of cocaine, and over $700,000 in cash.
[01:42:45.459 --> 01:42:49.483]  They also seized roughly 24 firearms, including an AK-47.
[01:42:49.643 --> 01:42:53.287]  We're not talking about $500 and $600 deals.
[01:42:53.327 --> 01:42:55.629]  We're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:42:55.949 --> 01:43:00.954]  You know, $20,000 in the trunk of somebody's car, in a gym bag, you know, behind... Alright, go ahead and fade this down.
[01:43:02.485 --> 01:43:15.394]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:43:15.634 --> 01:43:18.156]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:43:18.556 --> 01:43:19.657]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:43:20.317 --> 01:43:23.960]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.503]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:43:29.163 --> 01:43:29.724]  That's beautiful.
[01:43:30.184 --> 01:43:31.745]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:43:32.085 --> 01:43:33.106]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:43:33.706 --> 01:43:41.051]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:43:41.291 --> 01:43:43.253]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:43:43.613 --> 01:43:47.496]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:43:47.796 --> 01:43:48.717]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:43:49.497 --> 01:43:53.300]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:43:53.641 --> 01:43:54.481]  We are the resistance.
[01:43:54.722 --> 01:43:55.662]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[01:43:55.702 --> 01:43:57.064]  Okay, hold on.
[01:43:58.525 --> 01:44:03.469]  There's more.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:26.860]  Wow.
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:36.764]  Well look, apparently Beto needs four different non-stick pans to cook his miniature burgers or whatever that was he put on an English muffin with two pieces of broccoli.
[01:44:36.784 --> 01:44:39.145]  I've never seen anything quite like it, but it is kind of weird.
[01:44:39.165 --> 01:44:42.887]  It's like an alien trying to convince you that they're human, everything that Beto's been up to.
[01:44:43.007 --> 01:44:51.430]  But you know, I think that the problem that Beto is having now is he's eating all these burgers and it's causing indigestion and flatulation.
[01:44:51.670 --> 01:44:54.652]  And so I'm just here to offer Beto a solution.
[01:44:54.772 --> 01:45:02.456]  Apparently he's been flatulating more than the average cow that's causing global warming because he hasn't been taking his carnivore from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:02.516 --> 01:45:06.898]  So you may not know this, but when you eat red meat, sometimes it doesn't always digest properly.
[01:45:06.918 --> 01:45:08.298]  This can lead to indigestion.
[01:45:08.319 --> 01:45:10.260]  This can lead to flatulation.
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:12.981]  This can lead to other issues with digestion.
[01:45:13.181 --> 01:45:15.102]  And so we offer the probiotic carnivore.
[01:45:15.282 --> 01:45:18.363]  And I'm not even kidding you, I mean, I eat cheeseburgers a lot, probably too much.
[01:45:18.383 --> 01:45:20.604]  In fact, I'm trying to consciously cut back.
[01:45:20.864 --> 01:45:30.566]  But when I do, I do take the carnivore before I do with the digestive enzymes in there to help you properly digest red meat and high-protein foods.
[01:45:30.606 --> 01:45:32.587]  But Beto, he didn't get the memo.
[01:45:32.827 --> 01:45:39.669]  And so he's walking around campaigning after he eats a cheeseburger on an English muffin with a piece of broccoli, and he's flatulating more than a cow.
[01:45:39.909 --> 01:45:41.370]  But you gotta give it to Beto.
[01:45:41.651 --> 01:45:45.114]  It's courageous to eat that much red meat and walk around farting all day.
[01:45:45.334 --> 01:45:52.921]  But we're telling him, Carnivore from Infowarsstore.com, it's got the probiotics, it's got the enzymes to help you digest those burgers, Beto.
[01:45:52.981 --> 01:46:01.108]  So whether Beto wants to put his burger on an English muffin or whatever he wants to do, he better take his Carnivore before he does it.
[01:46:06.724 --> 01:46:10.186]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's now live.
[01:46:12.768 --> 01:46:13.649]  Band.Video.
[01:46:14.409 --> 01:46:15.630]  I actually kind of shout.
[01:46:16.931 --> 01:46:18.012]  Now!
[01:46:18.852 --> 01:46:20.673]  Over my cover!
[01:46:21.154 --> 01:46:25.056]  Band.Video!
[01:46:25.116 --> 01:46:25.717]  Band.Video!
[01:46:26.777 --> 01:46:27.338]  Band.Video!
[01:46:27.398 --> 01:46:27.998]  Band.Video!
[01:46:28.458 --> 01:46:29.039]  Band.Video!
[01:46:29.079 --> 01:46:29.559]  Band.Video!
[01:46:34.269 --> 01:46:35.290]  I don't sell snake oil.
[01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:37.211]  I sell fish oil.
[01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.432]  Wild harvested fish oil.
[01:46:39.632 --> 01:46:40.053]  Fish oil.
[01:46:40.453 --> 01:46:41.453]  The finest fish oil.
[01:46:41.613 --> 01:46:43.014]  The highest quality fish oil.
[01:46:43.254 --> 01:46:43.735]  Fish oil.
[01:46:43.755 --> 01:46:46.296]  The very best fish oil from the fjords.
[01:46:46.436 --> 01:46:47.457]  Highest quality fish oil.
[01:46:47.697 --> 01:46:48.177]  Fish oil.
[01:46:48.237 --> 01:46:48.498]  Fish oil.
[01:46:48.838 --> 01:46:49.258]  Fish oils.
[01:46:49.278 --> 01:46:49.558]  Fishin' oilin'.
[01:46:49.638 --> 01:46:49.999]  Fish oil.
[01:46:50.019 --> 01:46:50.379]  Fish oil.
[01:46:50.419 --> 01:46:50.599]  Fish oil.
[01:46:51.019 --> 01:46:51.459]  Fish oil.
[01:46:53.521 --> 01:46:57.043]  Oh my God.
[01:46:57.083 --> 01:46:58.664]  Take the fish oil or krill oil.
[01:46:58.984 --> 01:47:02.066]  Just like our information's dynamite, so are our products in forestore.com.
[01:47:05.037 --> 01:47:09.119]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:09.659 --> 01:47:10.960]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.823 --> 01:47:22.004]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[01:47:22.344 --> 01:47:24.805]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:47:25.125 --> 01:47:27.466]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:47:28.247 --> 01:47:30.948]  Okay, so there's so much fentanyl in this country.
[01:47:32.533 --> 01:47:40.196]  Earlier today, I just sent a link in to the producers and said, hey, look at the 25 tons of fentanyl seized, coming into Mexico, bound to the U.S.
[01:47:40.877 --> 01:47:45.358]  And somehow, they just got a clip out of Virginia, where they're calling it a record seizure.
[01:47:46.039 --> 01:47:48.680]  You know, a few pounds of it can kill 14 million people.
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:49.880]  Okay?
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:54.402]  And I'm glad we had this hiccup today, because it's really illustrative.
[01:47:55.603 --> 01:47:59.724]  A couple pounds of it can kill 14 million people.
[01:48:02.922 --> 01:48:03.383]  14 million people.
[01:48:05.505 --> 01:48:12.794]  What does 25 tons of pure fentanyl grabbed by the Mexican Navy bound to the U.S.
[01:48:12.834 --> 01:48:13.054]  do?
[01:48:15.517 --> 01:48:20.804]  And we're rolling footage for TV viewers of where this barely got a mention in the U.S.
[01:48:20.864 --> 01:48:21.745]  news a week ago.
[01:48:23.973 --> 01:48:49.813]  That's CGTV, the Mexican Navy seizes six tons at one spot, and in all the raids, it was 25 tons of ships, boats, offshore Chinese trawlers, loading it on to motorboats, and bringing it in to Mexico, to then be loaded on 18 wheelers and taken to the United States.
[01:48:49.893 --> 01:48:52.776]  So, understand, one of those little boxes
[01:48:53.829 --> 01:49:01.413]  Is more than the DEA's making a big deal about in Virginia that can kill 14 million people if it was overdosed.
[01:49:01.613 --> 01:49:04.334]  There's enough overdoses for 14 million people.
[01:49:04.374 --> 01:49:08.477]  This stuff's so strong before it's been cut that a single speck of it will kill you.
[01:49:10.358 --> 01:49:16.641]  Meanwhile, 25 tons got grabbed in different busts last week.
[01:49:17.021 --> 01:49:21.223]  And then you just type in fentanyl, DEA, more than 1 million fentanyl pills.
[01:49:21.603 --> 01:49:22.684]  She's in Arizona.
[01:49:27.708 --> 01:49:34.313]  More than 23,000 kilograms of Chinese fentanyl seized at Mexico's largest seaport.
[01:49:36.936 --> 01:49:37.956]  And that's a whole nother one!
[01:49:39.117 --> 01:49:46.764]  So, you're beginning to get the idea here, China has a very long memory, and they remember the British particularly.
[01:49:47.622 --> 01:49:49.924]  And that's how Skull & Bones made its money at Yale.
[01:49:50.485 --> 01:49:54.449]  The guy that founded it was the big opium distributor into the United States as well.
[01:49:55.029 --> 01:49:57.332]  And hell, they used to sell laudanum to women, men, children.
[01:49:58.132 --> 01:50:02.517]  You ever go out in the countryside, you'll find an old dump, there'll be hundreds of bottles that say laudanum.
[01:50:02.537 --> 01:50:05.099]  Because your baby was crying, you just gave him some laudanum.
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:07.402]  They were happy for five, six hours.
[01:50:07.422 --> 01:50:08.483]  Because it was opium!
[01:50:09.855 --> 01:50:12.576]  But the Chinese, you see, they execute you.
[01:50:13.317 --> 01:50:23.322]  If you get caught with one opium pill, much less fentanyl, if you get caught with one marijuana, cigarette, then you get executed.
[01:50:25.763 --> 01:50:31.346]  But, they ship it all here and they make most of our drugs in China.
[01:50:32.423 --> 01:50:33.884]  And they're spiking everything.
[01:50:33.904 --> 01:50:38.147]  And they're finding toxic waste in the over-the-counter pills you get.
[01:50:38.187 --> 01:50:42.570]  And they're finding plastic in most of the food that's shipped in from China.
[01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:47.053]  They are just pissing in our Cheerios with poison!
[01:50:49.014 --> 01:50:55.638]  And they're funding Netflix and Hollywood with all the anti-American race war movies.
[01:50:56.839 --> 01:50:59.621]  And trying to demoralize us constantly.
[01:51:03.658 --> 01:51:04.259]  It's incredible.
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:07.481]  And they know what they're doing.
[01:51:11.564 --> 01:51:13.786]  And again, they've killed 115 million of their own people.
[01:51:14.706 --> 01:51:16.728]  But they are really getting us back.
[01:51:17.288 --> 01:51:22.392]  Even though the United States really doesn't have any history of shipping opium in, it doesn't matter.
[01:51:23.233 --> 01:51:24.854]  We're still seen as a competitor to them.
[01:51:25.595 --> 01:51:26.736]  We're still seen as their enemy.
[01:51:28.519 --> 01:51:31.780]  And so, Japan bombed our ships in a sneak attack.
[01:51:32.160 --> 01:51:34.140]  They bombed military men and women.
[01:51:34.841 --> 01:51:35.741]  Mainly men at that time.
[01:51:36.741 --> 01:51:37.761]  They killed some women as well.
[01:51:38.962 --> 01:51:41.002]  And it was seen as dastardly because it was a sneak attack.
[01:51:41.962 --> 01:51:45.163]  That's, in the age of war at that time, was normal.
[01:51:46.323 --> 01:51:46.884]  Not a good thing.
[01:51:47.044 --> 01:51:47.684]  I'm not defending it.
[01:51:49.024 --> 01:51:52.345]  But the Chinese communists are shipping
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:52:01.685]  Let's pull up, what's the estimated amount of fentanyl, type in, estimated amount of fentanyl shipped in the U.S.
[01:52:01.825 --> 01:52:02.245]  annually?
[01:52:03.466 --> 01:52:03.747]  Is it 100 tons?
[01:52:03.767 --> 01:52:04.367]  Is it 200 tons?
[01:52:05.748 --> 01:52:06.189]  Is it 300 tons?
[01:52:06.229 --> 01:52:06.769]  Is it 400 tons?
[01:52:08.210 --> 01:52:11.593]  I mean, they just caught 25 tons coming in last week.
[01:52:21.909 --> 01:52:22.629]  And I could talk all day.
[01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:24.430]  I've got so much other news.
[01:52:24.691 --> 01:52:26.592]  But see, I've been harping on this, haven't I?
[01:52:29.513 --> 01:52:30.534]  Because let me show you the numbers.
[01:52:30.574 --> 01:52:31.494]  I mentioned this earlier.
[01:52:32.635 --> 01:52:40.299]  I've got the federal government's own numbers right here in my stack about the numbers here.
[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:42.861]  The latest numbers we have is 2017.
[01:52:48.462 --> 01:52:49.402]  And it says here it's 53,000.
[01:52:50.303 --> 01:52:52.264]  That graph we showed said 47,000.
[01:52:53.464 --> 01:52:54.524]  Let me show you this.
[01:52:54.584 --> 01:52:55.485]  Can I have an overhead shot?
[01:52:55.505 --> 01:52:55.965]  Thanks a lot.
[01:52:56.445 --> 01:52:56.665]  Here.
[01:52:58.686 --> 01:52:59.006]  Opioid.
[01:52:59.026 --> 01:53:01.947]  This is from the American Society of Addiction Medicine.
[01:53:03.128 --> 01:53:03.448]  They say 52,404.
[01:53:03.548 --> 01:53:03.828]  So I said 53.
[01:53:03.868 --> 01:53:04.928]  I was going from memory.
[01:53:04.948 --> 01:53:05.669]  And that was in 2017.
[01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:06.269]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:53:06.289 --> 01:53:06.849]  That number's even older.
[01:53:06.889 --> 01:53:07.009]  That's 2015.
[01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:08.830]  And they say it's up tenfold.
[01:53:18.957 --> 01:53:23.559]  So whether it's 47,000 or 53,000, whoever's right, that's a lot of people.
[01:53:23.839 --> 01:53:26.100]  And most people that die in overdoses, it never gets reported right.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:36.084]  So if it's 10 times that amount coming in right now, and they just seized 25 tons of it, but a couple pounds of it, can we cue that Virginia News piece up again?
[01:53:36.104 --> 01:53:36.385]  Thanks.
[01:53:38.786 --> 01:53:44.208]  If a small amount of it, I forget exactly how much they said, we'll play it again, would kill 14 million people,
[01:53:47.824 --> 01:53:50.165]  Because the numbers I've seen is a hundred times stronger than heroin.
[01:53:50.905 --> 01:53:54.786]  And then I see a hundred times stronger than opium, and heroin's a lot stronger than opium, so I don't know.
[01:53:55.106 --> 01:54:01.167]  Let's just say this, this stuff makes Oxycontin look like beer compared to Everclear, compared to white lightning.
[01:54:03.068 --> 01:54:06.828]  And there are people like zombies all over the place, totally addicted to this stuff.
[01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:12.690]  And the Chinese are doing it, and Trump's trying to fight it, and he's the bad guy.
[01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:17.411]  Just remember, the Federal Reserve's private, owned by Europe, trying to crash our economy.
[01:54:19.099 --> 01:54:22.300]  All these big media outlets are trying to bankrupt us, trying to get us shut down.
[01:54:22.380 --> 01:54:27.122]  All these big Democrat law firms are suing us because they want to continue hammering America.
[01:54:27.342 --> 01:54:29.803]  Because this is 21st century warfare.
[01:54:30.043 --> 01:54:32.904]  And everybody siding with the globalists is part of this.
[01:54:33.204 --> 01:54:37.726]  So again, here's that newscast out of Virginia, making a big deal out of a small amount being found.
[01:54:39.267 --> 01:54:42.888]  So if this small amount kills 14 million, what's 25 tons?
[01:54:43.168 --> 01:54:44.149]  Here it is.
[01:54:45.532 --> 01:54:49.194]  Investigators have busted a massive drug ring spanning three states.
[01:54:49.354 --> 01:54:51.194]  All this over just the last three days.
[01:54:51.274 --> 01:54:58.838]  Law enforcement officers in Virginia seized enough fentanyl to kill 14 million people as part of what they're calling Operation Cookout.
[01:54:59.158 --> 01:55:03.560]  There are 35 suspects that have been arrested, four others still on the run.
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:05.160]  Chip Reid is in Washington for us.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:08.041]  Chip, what else did investigators seize in this bust?
[01:55:08.061 --> 01:55:08.482]  Good morning.
[01:55:09.022 --> 01:55:12.263]  Well, authorities say they seized about 66 pounds of fentanyl.
[01:55:14.244 --> 01:55:16.025]  I'm so flustered today, I heard pounds.
[01:55:16.826 --> 01:55:18.147]  So that's why.
[01:55:18.687 --> 01:55:21.489]  I'm so flustered today, my normal trick memory's gone out the window.
[01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:22.410]  So I said play it again.
[01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:25.592]  So let's, we'll do the calculator thing tomorrow when I start the show.
[01:55:25.612 --> 01:55:33.597]  66 pounds or whatever, divided into 25 tons, how much smaller is that?
[01:55:34.778 --> 01:55:35.759]  What fraction is it?
[01:55:36.339 --> 01:55:39.962]  So that's going to kill 14 million, if it was taken in an overdose amount.
[01:55:41.428 --> 01:55:41.908]  What's 25 tons?
[01:55:42.048 --> 01:55:43.489]  Is that enough to kill the whole country?
[01:55:43.509 --> 01:55:47.671]  If it was all taken?
[01:55:47.691 --> 01:55:48.472]  330 million people?
[01:55:49.212 --> 01:55:50.053]  If we all took it?
[01:55:51.133 --> 01:55:51.774]  As an overdose?
[01:55:52.034 --> 01:55:54.175]  Is that enough to give us all an overdose and kill the whole country?
[01:55:54.435 --> 01:55:55.236]  Is that our headline?
[01:55:58.637 --> 01:56:03.380]  China tried to ship enough fentanyl into the United States to kill everybody in the U.S.?
[01:56:04.281 --> 01:56:05.501]  I don't have a calculator in front of me.
[01:56:05.521 --> 01:56:06.742]  I guess I could do it by hand.
[01:56:08.422 --> 01:56:09.123]  But that's crazy.
[01:56:09.743 --> 01:56:19.272]  Yeah, so 66 pounds, 66 pounds is .0013, according to my producers, of 25 tons.
[01:56:23.055 --> 01:56:28.700]  So we have to find out how much more 25 tons is to that, and then apply the number.
[01:56:29.461 --> 01:56:30.962]  So if 14 million is .0013,
[01:56:34.363 --> 01:56:35.366]  What with 25 tons?
[01:56:35.446 --> 01:56:37.411]  I think that could kill the whole country.
[01:56:38.554 --> 01:56:39.456]  I'm not a mathematician.
[01:56:39.617 --> 01:56:40.660]  I'll get that done tonight.
[01:56:41.061 --> 01:56:42.966]  First thing tomorrow, you'll hear from us.
[01:56:44.153 --> 01:56:53.343]  Okay, I didn't get to mainstream news telling you that Apple and Google and all the companies are watching and listening to you and selling your data and listening to you have sex and everything.
[01:56:53.643 --> 01:56:58.948]  They're only telling you now because they want to normalize it to move forward as this is the new economy.
[01:56:59.469 --> 01:57:01.611]  But that's the front page of Yahoo.
[01:57:02.011 --> 01:57:03.333]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:57:03.373 --> 01:57:04.294]  It's up on DreadReport.com.
[01:57:04.554 --> 01:57:07.357]  We'll explain why they're throwing it in your face now when we told you.
[01:57:10.692 --> 01:57:17.973]  We told you in 2004 with articles and covered it in detail with the actual documents so that's no mathematician but how many years ago is that?
[01:57:19.977 --> 01:57:20.438]  17 years ago?
[01:57:20.458 --> 01:57:22.159]  16 years ago?
[01:57:22.179 --> 01:57:24.160]  Because we're the bad guys.
[01:57:24.521 --> 01:57:26.902]  Remember, we're the Infowars of the bad guys.
[01:57:27.183 --> 01:57:28.403]  Don't tell anybody about this show.
[01:57:28.503 --> 01:57:30.125]  Don't tune in.
[01:57:30.145 --> 01:57:33.167]  The 25 tons of fentanyl is not the problem enough to kill the whole country, assuredly.
[01:57:33.767 --> 01:57:34.087]  No, no, no.
[01:57:34.107 --> 01:57:36.949]  The problem is that you own guns that can protect yourself.
[01:57:36.989 --> 01:57:37.550]  You're bad.
[01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:42.513]  And the same folks that want Trump to not stop the fentanyl, they want your guns because they want you out of the way.
[01:57:42.734 --> 01:57:44.335]  They want to conquer you and dominate you.
[01:57:45.016 --> 01:57:45.938]  Thank you all for tuning in.
[01:57:45.999 --> 01:57:47.824]  Lord willing, I'll be on tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:57:47.845 --> 01:57:48.146]  Central.
[01:57:48.386 --> 01:57:49.570]  I'm gonna try my best to be live.
[01:57:49.951 --> 01:57:50.473]  I will be here.
[01:58:02.483 --> 01:58:04.124]  Joe in California, then Kevin.
[01:58:04.144 --> 01:58:04.745]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:58:04.765 --> 01:58:05.245]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:05.325 --> 01:58:05.765]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:05.905 --> 01:58:16.932]  I wanted to say to you that when history presents itself, that you are one of the most important people that this country's ever had, as far as getting the word out, making the truth of what's going on in our country.
[01:58:17.172 --> 01:58:22.576]  And I want to thank you for that, because 15 years ago, when I started listening to you, I had no idea what was going on.
[01:58:22.836 --> 01:58:27.119]  And now people, when I talk to people, they think I'm crazy, and I just tell them, here's the fact.
[01:58:27.299 --> 01:58:28.500]  And I'm educating people.
[01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:32.062]  My family thought I was crazy for a long time, but now they're really educated.
[01:58:32.162 --> 01:58:32.602]  We're good to go.
[01:58:32.622 --> 01:58:33.363]  We're good to go on what's going on.
[01:58:33.383 --> 01:58:35.524]  But what I really want to talk to you about is two things.
[01:58:35.604 --> 01:58:36.884]  Your product are incredible.
[01:58:36.984 --> 01:58:38.725]  I've been using them for the last five years.
[01:58:38.745 --> 01:58:39.646]  Forty nine years old, 50.
[01:58:39.786 --> 01:58:42.087]  And I was out of shape.
[01:58:42.187 --> 01:58:43.567]  I was in shape for a long time.
[01:58:43.607 --> 01:58:49.090]  My life, I got out of shape, gained about 40 pounds and I started taking bone broth and the super male vitality.
[01:58:49.190 --> 01:58:52.211]  And I'll tell you one thing, my body looks like it's about 30 years old.
[01:58:52.371 --> 01:58:53.132]  I get all the time.
[01:58:53.172 --> 01:58:54.793]  People ask me, you know what my age is.
[01:58:54.853 --> 01:58:54.993]  And I
