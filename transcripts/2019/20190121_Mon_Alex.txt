[00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.971]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:22.335]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:26.137]  Yeah, there's a storm on the loose.
[00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:27.358]  Sirens in my head.
[00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:29.440]  Wrapped up in silence.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.441]  All circuits are dead.
[00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:33.102]  Can I decode?
[00:00:33.202 --> 00:00:36.624]  My whole life spins into a frenzy.
[00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:55.412]  Ladies and gentlemen, the bullet just hit the bone as we entered the Twilight Zone.
[00:00:56.573 --> 00:01:00.396]  There's the headline, Beijing confirms birth of gene-edited babies.
[00:01:02.455 --> 00:01:06.938]  Not really humans, ladies and gentlemen, but by the true definition, humanoids.
[00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:18.845]  China confirms the birth of gene-edited babies and vows to punish scientist, he, John Koo, who violated rules to carry out the unethical study for personal fame.
[00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:20.026]  Oh, that's why he's in trouble.
[00:01:20.506 --> 00:01:22.947]  Ladies and gentlemen, this has been going on a long time.
[00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:27.270]  There have been human clones in Petri dishes for 40 years.
[00:01:30.794 --> 00:01:34.276]  That's just boilerplate, one of the things we have here.
[00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:47.702]  You know, sometimes something happens in the corporate fake news world, in these formulaic deceptions they involve themselves that goes completely megaviral.
[00:01:51.284 --> 00:01:54.966]  And that happened in the last two days.
[00:01:55.426 --> 00:01:57.647]  We were there, the Women's March, our crew covering it Saturday.
[00:01:59.677 --> 00:02:03.818]  And Rob Dew, Saturday afternoon, sent me footage and said, look at this.
[00:02:03.858 --> 00:02:08.679]  They're claiming that these students harassed and encircled some poor Native American people.
[00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:18.502]  And we went and found the raw footage and they're calling them white scum.
[00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:20.482]  I mean, I've got the list here.
[00:02:21.963 --> 00:02:26.804]  Some of the black kids that were there with them from their school, they were calling them traitors and saying, we're going to harvest your organs.
[00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:32.749]  They were calling them fags and queers and gay.
[00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.772]  And the N-word's being yelled as well.
[00:02:36.792 --> 00:02:40.995]  And people are calling now for the students to be killed, their school to be burned down, then to be shot.
[00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:42.556]  Twitter's leaving it up and agrees with it.
[00:02:45.358 --> 00:02:51.121]  And then NPR had Nathan Phillips on this morning.
[00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:52.182]  Nobody's picked this up.
[00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.003]  We had to go find it on NPR.
[00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:57.526]  In a snake-like voice with a snake-like presenter.
[00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:04.407]  Going, this young man needs to apologize for what he did to us.
[00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:08.228]  We've got to put this audio to all the raw video.
[00:03:08.268 --> 00:03:09.148]  It's so powerful.
[00:03:10.048 --> 00:03:11.789]  It's so terrible what they did.
[00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:25.012]  Based on a lot of what has happened in our country recently, you were under the impression, or making an assumption, that a large group of young white men might threaten a minority who you saw.
[00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:27.233]  And you saw this group of black Hebrew Israelites.
[00:03:28.693 --> 00:03:35.756]  potentially in danger by this large group of white men, based on what you had seen in the news in our country in recent months and years.
[00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:36.477]  Yes.
[00:03:37.357 --> 00:03:40.759]  Thank you for that clarity, because that's... Let's stop right there.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.620]  The snake people!
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.524]  They can be Native American, they can be white, they can be black, all talk in this very soft, deceptive voice.
[00:03:52.104 --> 00:03:54.145]  You know the spider by the voice.
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.646]  Now, the truth is, you've got this particular group of, quote, Black Israelites, who are a diverse group.
[00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:00.788]  A lot of those folks are my listeners.
[00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.390]  I run into them.
[00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.033]  I'm in Houston and Dallas and L.A.
[00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:04.613]  There's a lot of them.
[00:04:05.014 --> 00:04:06.716]  And they seem to be pretty woke a lot of the time.
[00:04:07.798 --> 00:04:09.160]  But this particular group...
[00:04:10.424 --> 00:04:18.967]  He's mixed in with a bunch of other white people, Native Americans, who start virtue signaling how much they hate being white.
[00:04:19.508 --> 00:04:23.949]  And so, you've got blacks, you've got whites, you've got Native Americans screaming.
[00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:25.750]  And we're going to play this audio.
[00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.471]  It's all garbled, but people have isolated it, and the young people have talked about it.
[00:04:29.932 --> 00:04:34.453]  In their faces, while there's beating drums, they march up, march in the middle of them, waiting for their bus.
[00:04:34.793 --> 00:04:35.994]  They just had their pro-life march.
[00:04:37.165 --> 00:04:40.587]  And they're screaming, we're gonna kill you, you faggots.
[00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:42.948]  We're gonna kill you and take your organs.
[00:04:42.968 --> 00:04:44.728]  And they're like, let's go, let's go, let's get them.
[00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:46.589]  They're like, yeah, it's on, bitches!
[00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:48.370]  And they march over to the middle.
[00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.851]  And some of these kids are as young as 10.
[00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:53.712]  They just sit there and do their school chant.
[00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:55.033]  So they were scared.
[00:04:56.374 --> 00:04:58.355]  With a bunch of men coming up threatening to kill them!
[00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:01.116]  And then NPR says they're bad kids.
[00:05:06.772 --> 00:05:09.454]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:15.717]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:05:16.257 --> 00:05:28.244]  TurboForce from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:06:08.428 --> 00:06:12.331]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:20.415]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.416 --> 00:06:30.682]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are moments when you know the world's gonna change.
[00:06:31.142 --> 00:06:32.843]  Like Martin Luther King's speech, I Have a Dream.
[00:06:34.073 --> 00:07:03.159]  There are positive moments, there are also negative moments, and I can tell you, the zeitgeist that's been hit with the mainstream corporate media, from ABC to CBS to NBC to NPR to all the local TV stations where I live, all saying, did you see the young gang of white supremacists wearing Make America Great Again hats go up to an innocent elder, this wonderful, good, loving man, and
[00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:07.419]  Ridicule and attack him viciously.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.021]  Notice that on all these different channels and places, they don't show more than one or two seconds of video or audio.
[00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:20.943]  That's because you've got this group of Native Americans, blacks and whites,
[00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:26.346]  Saying, look at them!
[00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:27.267]  They're over there!
[00:07:27.507 --> 00:07:28.568]  Let's go get them!
[00:07:29.328 --> 00:07:30.629]  They're a bunch of fags!
[00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.631]  Let's kill them and take their organs!
[00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:34.512]  You white pieces of crap!
[00:07:35.393 --> 00:07:37.114]  You white people need to die!
[00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:40.737]  They hear hundreds of people yelling this at them.
[00:07:41.257 --> 00:07:42.158]  They're waiting for their bus.
[00:07:42.178 --> 00:07:43.319]  You can watch the raw video.
[00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:44.920]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.021]  We're gonna play some of it here.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.321]  And this is, you know, the whole Women's March.
[00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.062]  They were just there for a right-to-life, pro-life march.
[00:07:52.883 --> 00:08:01.006]  But these minorities should be thanking God that there are mainly white pro-lifers out trying to stop the abortion, because most abortion is, quote, minorities.
[00:08:01.026 --> 00:08:03.787]  But they don't care about the real genocidal threat to them.
[00:08:04.147 --> 00:08:14.992]  They see a Catholic school group, only a couple black guys, a couple Hispanics, maybe 30, 40 other white kids over there.
[00:08:15.936 --> 00:08:22.845]  And at first, because there's like six minutes of video, there's a bunch of chanting and beating, and then they keep saying, look, they're wearing red hats.
[00:08:23.446 --> 00:08:32.377]  So they start yelling at them and screaming, and then they march over and bust into the middle of them and do all these terrible things to them.
[00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.192]  And then the media says they're Nazis.
[00:08:36.632 --> 00:08:48.959]  And so then Twitter, and I've got articles up on Infowars.com, all the tweets, hundreds of tweets from Kathy Griffin and, quote, rock and roll stars and people saying, I want you to go to their school and I want you to shoot every one of them.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:55.323]  If you're a true fan of shoes, I want you to fire on any of these red hat bitches when you see them on site.
[00:08:56.464 --> 00:08:59.566]  Lock the kids in the school and burn that bitch to the ground.
[00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:04.204]  So there's somebody saying he's a school shooter and he wants others to join him.
[00:09:04.444 --> 00:09:05.505]  He will not be arrested.
[00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:07.427]  He will be worshipped.
[00:09:07.807 --> 00:09:10.129]  Twitter is leaving him up and says it's authorized.
[00:09:10.609 --> 00:09:15.653]  And it goes on from there with Kathy Griffin saying find him, get him, their families are being death-threatened in Mass.
[00:09:15.953 --> 00:09:17.575]  And Twitter is still not apologizing.
[00:09:17.955 --> 00:09:19.336]  I went to these different sites today.
[00:09:19.596 --> 00:09:23.039]  This shoes guy, you know, looks like a child molester.
[00:09:23.059 --> 00:09:23.740]  I don't know if he is.
[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.261]  Probably not.
[00:09:25.281 --> 00:09:26.041]  Probably a wonderful person.
[00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:27.102]  He just wants to kill kids.
[00:09:27.142 --> 00:09:28.583]  He just wants to burn them down and murder them.
[00:09:28.724 --> 00:09:29.604]  He doesn't want to molest them.
[00:09:29.764 --> 00:09:30.905]  So I guess he's worse than that.
[00:09:31.726 --> 00:09:34.588]  And so here he is saying all this, and I went to his Twitter.
[00:09:34.628 --> 00:09:35.669]  He's still defending it.
[00:09:38.352 --> 00:09:39.673]  Kathy Grittman says, dox them.
[00:09:40.874 --> 00:09:41.534]  I want names.
[00:09:41.674 --> 00:09:42.075]  Shame them.
[00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:42.535]  Don't worry.
[00:09:42.635 --> 00:09:43.055]  They did.
[00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:44.577]  I want names!
[00:09:46.391 --> 00:09:48.212]  A lot of them were just wearing red team hats.
[00:09:48.232 --> 00:09:49.833]  A few of them were wearing MAGA hats.
[00:09:49.873 --> 00:09:50.774]  Others were wearing blue hats.
[00:09:50.994 --> 00:09:52.395]  But there were a few Trump hats in there.
[00:09:53.036 --> 00:10:01.802]  And so, when the mob of anti-white, anti-Trump racists walk the 40 yards over, they suddenly learn, oh my God, these are all team hats.
[00:10:02.202 --> 00:10:03.023]  They're school colors.
[00:10:03.043 --> 00:10:04.364]  They're red, white, and blue.
[00:10:05.144 --> 00:10:07.286]  Oh my God, there's only a few of them with MAGA hats.
[00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:11.209]  So then they go get in their face and start screaming, we're gonna kill you!
[00:10:11.809 --> 00:10:13.870]  We're gonna rip your organs out!
[00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.352]  You just all being screamed and yelled.
[00:10:16.172 --> 00:10:18.294]  And so, stoically, they sit there and they take it.
[00:10:20.435 --> 00:10:27.240]  And they simply chant their school songs.
[00:10:28.101 --> 00:10:29.182]  Their pep rally songs.
[00:10:30.102 --> 00:10:35.246]  And the little black kids that are with them, part of the school, are being screamed, we're gonna take your organs, we're gonna kill you, boy.
[00:10:36.087 --> 00:10:45.134]  And then, this guy has the nerve, Nathan Phillips, who led the racist gang over towards what he thought was a group of Trump supporters only.
[00:10:45.894 --> 00:10:50.338]  He goes on NPR and they snake-like worship him.
[00:10:50.939 --> 00:10:53.501]  And he says, these kids ought to be ashamed of themselves.
[00:10:53.521 --> 00:10:54.782]  They're such bad people.
[00:10:55.222 --> 00:10:56.083]  Why were they there?
[00:10:56.143 --> 00:11:06.012]  I felt like the black men, oh yes, the hundreds of black men of the black Israelite movement that says that they're the master race and all the rest of this stuff.
[00:11:06.252 --> 00:11:07.833]  And fine, you can say that if you want, that's your right.
[00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:29.765]  This poor group that says they're the master race, we're just over here, us poor little Native Americans, we've never heard anybody, we're so sweet, we're so nice to each other on our own reservations, highest crime rate, murder rate, drug rate, alcoholism rate, I'm very sad for them, but oh, we're these perfect good people with some white trash with us virtue signaling saying, you know, kill these white boys.
[00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:36.273]  And they get over there and there's some black kids from the school and they're like hugging their buddies because they're like 10 years old.
[00:11:36.754 --> 00:11:38.995]  Like, you know, these are their loving school family.
[00:11:39.556 --> 00:11:42.538]  And then they've just got a racist mob telling them they're gonna die!
[00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:46.802]  But don't worry, NPR doesn't play any audio or anything.
[00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:50.125]  NPR didn't play them saying, we're gonna kill you white scum.
[00:11:50.145 --> 00:11:51.206]  We're gonna play the audio coming up.
[00:11:51.846 --> 00:11:53.747]  You can hear it in the melee, confirming what the student said.
[00:11:54.067 --> 00:12:05.451]  No, they play the snake-like presenter and the snake-like, you know, evil wizard-like little con man coming over and bullying children.
[00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:10.550]  You know, I've got some Native American roots, and I'm not ashamed of them.
[00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.932]  But let me tell you, you've been around the reservations, you've been around Native Americans.
[00:12:14.552 --> 00:12:16.133]  Some days I wonder if I'm proud of it.
[00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:17.713]  I'll just be point-blank with you.
[00:12:18.093 --> 00:12:24.096]  Because it's in this modern world, Native Americans, in my experience, are a bunch of violent liars.
[00:12:25.185 --> 00:12:31.628]  And con men, on average, who think everybody owes them something and they can go around bullying and hurting whoever they want.
[00:12:31.988 --> 00:12:32.829]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:12:33.449 --> 00:12:41.593]  I'm sick of Nazis, I'm sick of black supremacists, I'm sick of Native American supremacists that feed on their own tribes and their own people in my experiences.
[00:12:43.194 --> 00:12:44.515]  You want to know why the Native Americans lost?
[00:12:44.535 --> 00:12:45.875]  Because their elders sold them out.
[00:12:46.696 --> 00:12:47.456]  You want to know why?
[00:12:48.136 --> 00:12:52.078]  Because their culture was inferior to the Renaissance and Christianity.
[00:12:52.298 --> 00:12:52.759]  That's why!
[00:12:53.854 --> 00:12:59.436]  And instead of embracing this culture, they sit there and buy into the whole Me Too movement and piss all over themselves.
[00:13:00.256 --> 00:13:03.597]  There are a lot of good Native Americans as well, and they reject all this crap.
[00:13:04.037 --> 00:13:04.417]  Excuse me.
[00:13:04.857 --> 00:13:13.560]  I get a little angry looking at this guy who's gone on CNN and everywhere else and what a big victim he is, when he's with a group screaming, we're gonna kill you!
[00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:17.141]  Bullying people!
[00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:20.002]  And then that's what this turns into.
[00:13:23.493 --> 00:13:24.913]  No, they marched over there to start a fight!
[00:13:26.234 --> 00:13:27.854]  He marched over there to take a scalp!
[00:13:28.295 --> 00:13:28.855]  That's what he did!
[00:13:31.516 --> 00:13:34.377]  You know why the Westerners didn't like a lot of Native Americans?
[00:13:34.397 --> 00:13:35.537]  Because they'd kill women and children!
[00:13:37.658 --> 00:13:38.438]  And they'd rape them!
[00:13:39.198 --> 00:13:43.159]  Oh, but they're the perfect, oh, oh, fountains of goodness!
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.020]  Fountains of love!
[00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:46.941]  Fountains of perfectness!
[00:13:49.802 --> 00:13:50.622]  It's disgusting!
[00:13:53.436 --> 00:13:55.680]  Let's go ahead and go to the snake-like NPR.
[00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.922]  You listen to this for yourself.
[00:13:56.962 --> 00:13:57.363]  Here it is.
[00:13:58.725 --> 00:14:03.412]  Are you saying that based on a lot of what has happened in our country recently, you were
[00:14:05.117 --> 00:14:23.910]  Under the impression or making an assumption that a large group of young white men might threaten a minority who you saw, and that you saw this group of black Hebrew Israelites as potentially in danger by this large group of white men based on what you had seen in the news in our country in recent months and years.
[00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.590]  Yes.
[00:14:25.511 --> 00:14:31.595]  Thank you for that clarity, because that's what it was in my mind and in my heart.
[00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:49.379]  Because when I seen those young men, I was seeing their faces, and the thing is, is that those young men could have chose to not feed into those guys, those Israelite fellas.
[00:14:49.979 --> 00:14:59.501]  They could have chose, the students' teachers, the students' chaperones, could have instructed those students to exit that area.
[00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:06.785]  This wasn't something that they needed to bring their high schools into and being involved in.
[00:15:06.985 --> 00:15:08.666]  Can I ask a question this way?
[00:15:09.047 --> 00:15:10.027]  Hold on a second.
[00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:25.198]  I'm so loving and I'm so good and I'm over here with a group of black Israelites, full-grown adults, and 40, 50 yards away there's a bunch of kids wearing red, white, and blue because that's their school colors and they're at a prayer march for babies, a pro-life march.
[00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:28.921]  And I marched over just to let them know that I wasn't gonna
[00:15:29.321 --> 00:15:31.042]  Put up with that, because I needed to protect.
[00:15:31.843 --> 00:15:35.285]  I needed to protect the black people that say they're the master race.
[00:15:35.885 --> 00:15:37.226]  I needed to do that right away.
[00:15:37.246 --> 00:15:41.669]  And then the NPR person is so empathetic and so real.
[00:15:42.089 --> 00:15:42.789]  Oh, can I?
[00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.690]  Hold on.
[00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.811]  Can I say something to you now?
[00:15:46.472 --> 00:15:51.095]  Now we come back, we're gonna play the raw footage, and then we're gonna play footage, the raw footage where I had women come up.
[00:15:51.835 --> 00:15:52.696]  A few months ago in D.C.
[00:15:53.276 --> 00:16:00.421]  saying you're a white inbred worm, your mother's married to your brother, you're a monkey, and then the media said the opposite!
[00:16:02.722 --> 00:16:06.925]  Imagine if Infowars hadn't been here to expose the local government.
[00:16:07.765 --> 00:16:11.728]  To expose their plan to implode national sovereignty and nation's borders.
[00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:20.534]  Imagine if the lights had been turned off all those years, and the incredibly important topics we talk about hadn't been discussed.
[00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.752]  But it's because of you doing that over the years that we're here.
[00:16:26.493 --> 00:16:27.973]  And that's not some platitude.
[00:16:28.013 --> 00:16:29.154]  That's not some pat on the back.
[00:16:30.355 --> 00:16:36.238]  That is the humble recognition that you are the sea on which all of us sail.
[00:16:37.939 --> 00:16:38.500]  I'm the sea.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.260]  You're the sea.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.361]  I'm the wind.
[00:16:41.962 --> 00:16:42.622]  You're the wind.
[00:16:42.742 --> 00:16:45.043]  We are all the sails together in this.
[00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:52.951]  If you hadn't resonated with what we talked about and what we did, if you hadn't prayed for us and spread the word and supported us, we wouldn't be here.
[00:16:53.531 --> 00:17:07.343]  If you hadn't been faithful in our shared destiny together, we wouldn't have already had these successes and nationalism exploding across the world and all the incredible positive things happening that have unfolded.
[00:17:09.085 --> 00:17:10.286]  But because of you, we've done that.
[00:17:11.223 --> 00:17:11.943]  There's an equation.
[00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:18.085]  If you spread the word about InfoWars and the articles, the videos, the links, we get around the enemy.
[00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:24.847]  And if you fund the information we're producing, it all comes together.
[00:17:25.487 --> 00:17:27.448]  But it comes down to that, chicken or the egg.
[00:17:28.428 --> 00:17:38.991]  If you don't fund the seed money to keep InfoWars on the air and to fight against the fake lawsuits, the attacks of Soros and Hillary and others, we won't have the information to put on air for all of you to spread.
[00:17:39.904 --> 00:17:47.007]  So each one is just as important, but the most critical point the enemy understands is cutting the funding off.
[00:17:48.307 --> 00:17:51.488]  They don't want to have us be live on air while all this unfolds.
[00:17:52.929 --> 00:17:58.771]  They don't want to have us be here while the globalists push their entire world government agenda and everything we've talked about comes true.
[00:17:59.311 --> 00:18:05.573]  They don't want us here where they try to assassinate nationalists and populist leaders and while they overrun Christian countries with radical Islamists.
[00:18:05.954 --> 00:18:06.754]  They want us off the air.
[00:18:08.814 --> 00:18:11.917]  And that's why I am in your hands, you're in my hands.
[00:18:12.298 --> 00:18:16.122]  If I give up, if I back down, if I waver, it's a big victory for the globalists.
[00:18:16.963 --> 00:18:20.447]  And if you back down, if you waver, it's a big victory for them as well.
[00:18:21.588 --> 00:18:24.351]  It's truly a life and death struggle.
[00:18:24.951 --> 00:18:26.493]  So all I'm going to say in closing is this.
[00:18:27.494 --> 00:18:28.936]  Our destinies are bound forever.
[00:18:30.517 --> 00:18:30.658]  And
[00:18:32.355 --> 00:18:36.558]  Doing something this epic almost feels sick to say, hey, come give me your money.
[00:18:37.358 --> 00:18:38.919]  But you've seen what I've done with your money.
[00:18:38.939 --> 00:18:42.322]  I have waged war, fearlessly and tirelessly.
[00:18:42.462 --> 00:18:44.183]  I have dominated globalists.
[00:18:44.263 --> 00:18:45.704]  I have overrun their emplacements.
[00:18:46.224 --> 00:18:50.787]  We have spread the message of liberty in 1776 worldwide, and we are committed to that destiny.
[00:18:51.267 --> 00:18:53.889]  And so with pride, I tell you, financially support us.
[00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:58.672]  Any other war chief in a fight for freedom would just say, support me, give me the funding now.
[00:18:58.692 --> 00:18:59.253]  I say,
[00:19:00.765 --> 00:19:06.548]  Get products of the best out there, win-win situation, fund us, and we're going to stop altogether.
[00:19:07.108 --> 00:19:10.450]  If we don't do that, there's no future, and we have no shared destiny.
[00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:18.934]  I'm very sad that Supermill Vitality, our flagship product, is no longer available when this sells out, because we can't get the wild, crafted herbs.
[00:19:19.434 --> 00:19:23.877]  The process it goes through is so organic, like making of wine, that it can't be produced anymore.
[00:19:24.637 --> 00:19:25.738]  So that's why it's the last run.
[00:19:26.752 --> 00:19:31.998]  It's available 50% off, even though it's our last run, at InForce4.com, because I want you to experience it before it's gone.
[00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:36.972]  But whatever you do, pray for InfoWars, spread the articles, spread the links, spread the videos.
[00:19:37.292 --> 00:19:40.234]  Because without you, we are going to basically be destroyed.
[00:19:40.734 --> 00:19:43.315]  But with your support, together we all go into the future.
[00:19:43.715 --> 00:19:52.339]  Whatever you do, just remember that the power of you, via word of mouth, speaking out and taking action, is the most powerful thing in the universe, next to God.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.042]  And for your support, and your undying prayers, I thank you, and I salute you.
[00:19:58.062 --> 00:20:00.543]  But more importantly, we are bound, and I love you.
[00:20:01.104 --> 00:20:01.504]  So thank you.
[00:20:06.515 --> 00:20:10.619]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:27.692 --> 00:20:32.096]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:20:32.516 --> 00:20:35.479]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:40.082]  This story is so huge.
[00:20:41.842 --> 00:20:45.964]  Radio listeners have to go to Infowars.com and Newswars.com to see the raw videos for yourself.
[00:20:46.305 --> 00:20:51.547]  For TV viewers, I'm about to roll some of them because it shows the anatomy and how they engage in the fraud.
[00:20:52.527 --> 00:20:53.528]  The group that broke it
[00:20:54.474 --> 00:20:55.455]  Works with Facebook.
[00:20:56.115 --> 00:21:15.731]  And they did the exact same fraud on me with another group of, quote, Native American people, where these women walk up, blow cigarette smoke in my face, call me a monkey, say my mother's married to her brother, and that those are my parents, and that we're gonna die out, and F you, and all this other crazy crap.
[00:21:16.638 --> 00:21:19.200]  And I say, my goodness, you're Brown KKK.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.081]  How racist of you.
[00:21:20.582 --> 00:21:30.951]  They edit out all of the stuff they said, them coming over and confronting me, and then say, Jones viciously gets in the face and accosts Native American women.
[00:21:31.991 --> 00:21:33.171]  By calling them Brown KKK.
[00:21:33.271 --> 00:21:34.372]  It's called NowThis.
[00:21:34.992 --> 00:21:39.813]  And I am letting NowThis know, they're at the top of the list to be sued for defamation.
[00:21:39.853 --> 00:21:41.034]  We are going to be filing suits.
[00:21:41.414 --> 00:21:44.635]  There's so much defamation we've got to teach people though, that we're going to do it.
[00:21:45.235 --> 00:21:49.176]  You accuse me of harassing Sandy Hook families and sending people to their houses when I never did it.
[00:21:49.917 --> 00:22:00.780]  But then meanwhile, they have all these programs where they go and harass kids and other things in public and harass Trump supporters, and then edit the videos and say that we harassed you.
[00:22:01.823 --> 00:22:05.526]  You've got Kathy Griffin and all the other people saying, go to their houses, attack them.
[00:22:06.487 --> 00:22:10.431]  You've got people saying, kill them, blow up their school, shoot them, burn their school up.
[00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:11.712]  It's all over the place.
[00:22:12.192 --> 00:22:20.940]  And the media, a day and a half, two days after this all got exposed as a hoax, they're still defending it everywhere.
[00:22:22.159 --> 00:22:25.720]  There's a powerful meme that's posted on Infowars.com in the live feed section.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.721]  You'll never guess which behavior the media deemed inappropriate for society.
[00:22:30.261 --> 00:22:50.325]  That's right, the gay mag is a naked man posing with a eight-year-old boy in a pedophilic stance, but they said it's improper for a stoic young man to sit there with a friendly smile on his face while people are screaming around him, we're gonna harvest your organs, we're gonna kill you, everything else.
[00:22:51.584 --> 00:22:58.087]  Now let's go ahead and roll some video that has had analysis added to it.
[00:22:58.467 --> 00:23:00.788]  And we have the raw video posted at Infowars.com.
[00:23:00.988 --> 00:23:02.248]  But Daily Caller put this together.
[00:23:02.288 --> 00:23:02.608]  Here it is.
[00:23:02.628 --> 00:23:13.033]  This is the raw footage of the group of Women's March leftist bottom feeder types screaming all these horrible things.
[00:23:13.113 --> 00:23:13.673]  Grown men!
[00:23:15.165 --> 00:23:23.889]  Like it's a motorcycle gang, Hells Angels versus the Banditos, marching over to a group of school kids, some as young, we are now learning, as seven.
[00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:30.993]  So here's a group of men coming over and telling as young as seven-year-olds, we're going to kill you and take your organs.
[00:23:31.273 --> 00:23:33.354]  And then this is turned into their poor little victims.
[00:23:33.374 --> 00:23:33.734]  Here it is.
[00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:43.559]  The Native American elder approaches the Covington Catholic students.
[00:23:45.677 --> 00:23:46.798]  The march is over 40 yards.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.744]  It goes on and on.
[00:23:53.244 --> 00:23:55.486]  Covington Catholic students waiting for the school bus.
[00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:56.928]  Native American elder approaching.
[00:24:01.032 --> 00:24:06.177]  So that he can then trigger an event and lead the group that then comes in behind him.
[00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:13.259]  Here they come!
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:14.881]  They're marching in.
[00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:16.602]  Look at the hats!
[00:24:17.502 --> 00:24:20.144]  Look at the hats!
[00:24:20.184 --> 00:24:20.925]  We ain't takin'!
[00:24:22.045 --> 00:24:23.046]  Look, we not!
[00:24:25.087 --> 00:24:26.028]  So they're beating drums.
[00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:29.631]  And so the kids are doing their own chant.
[00:24:29.731 --> 00:24:32.112]  But the media only chose to show this later part.
[00:24:32.773 --> 00:24:33.833]  It looks like they've surrounded him.
[00:24:36.895 --> 00:24:38.176]  That goes on for a minute after a minute.
[00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:41.799]  You listen carefully, you hear, we're gonna kill you, we're gonna take your organs.
[00:24:45.703 --> 00:24:48.388]  So someone gets in your face and beats a drum in it, you're the bad person.
[00:24:48.408 --> 00:24:51.214]  Students were then subjected to racial slurs.
[00:24:52.556 --> 00:24:53.057]  Yeah, back it up.
[00:24:53.237 --> 00:24:54.941]  This is when all the threatening starts.
[00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:56.363]  Back it up ten seconds.
[00:24:58.092 --> 00:25:02.316]  Go back to Europe, this isn't your land, and now we're gonna cut your organs out.
[00:25:02.356 --> 00:25:03.477]  We're gonna kill you.
[00:25:04.078 --> 00:25:05.299]  And this is corporate media.
[00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:07.641]  This is anti-American media, enemy of the people.
[00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:10.924]  The very same group edited this and put this out.
[00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:15.749]  We have the raw footage at Infowars.com versus theirs, saying this about me.
[00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.651]  Blowing cigarette smoke in my face.
[00:25:20.013 --> 00:25:21.915]  Saying you're gonna die out, white monkey.
[00:25:23.058 --> 00:25:25.519]  Saying that my mother and my father were brother and sister.
[00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:26.859]  Telling me to F off.
[00:25:27.179 --> 00:25:32.700]  That turns into them saying, I'm a sweet little person, I'm just a veteran.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.881]  And I kept wondering why she would say horrible things and then go back to, I'm just a sweet little veteran.
[00:25:38.041 --> 00:25:38.861]  F you, I hope you die.
[00:25:39.161 --> 00:25:47.883]  It's because it turns out, we have evidence, well we saw Soros groups paying some of the groups that were there to testify off, that these women were set up to be sent in against me.
[00:25:48.925 --> 00:25:53.887]  See, they're rigging this crap, folks, but the good news is, people are exposing it.
[00:25:54.087 --> 00:26:03.012]  I don't know if this was rigged, but the same group that gets tens of millions of views that Facebook pushes did this to me a few months ago at the congressional hearings.
[00:26:05.593 --> 00:26:06.053]  Unbelievable.
[00:26:06.793 --> 00:26:08.474]  Oh, and it turns out, this is from 2015, same head of American,
[00:26:11.087 --> 00:26:15.069]  How much does a job of professional liar pay in 2019?
[00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.951]  Or is professional victim a more appropriate title?
[00:26:18.211 --> 00:26:19.592]  And turns out he's been a victim before.
[00:26:19.772 --> 00:26:20.753]  I didn't even know this.
[00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:22.394]  I just said it and they found it.
[00:26:22.694 --> 00:26:23.335]  Unbelievable!
[00:26:23.835 --> 00:26:24.715]  From Fox 2.
[00:26:24.876 --> 00:26:25.696]  Get me that report.
[00:26:26.737 --> 00:26:28.498]  Turns out this guy's a professional victim.
[00:26:28.538 --> 00:26:29.899]  There's reports about it years ago.
[00:26:30.499 --> 00:26:32.060]  Holy mackerel!
[00:26:34.441 --> 00:26:35.322]  But here's the good news.
[00:26:36.042 --> 00:26:36.663]  Here's the good news.
[00:26:39.278 --> 00:26:40.338]  People see through this crap now.
[00:26:40.358 --> 00:26:41.358]  They know what to look for.
[00:26:41.699 --> 00:26:42.799]  And there's cameras everywhere.
[00:26:43.219 --> 00:26:44.559]  And it's backfiring on Big Brother.
[00:26:44.939 --> 00:26:48.620]  So, they wanted to try to get these... Look at some of these kids, they're age 7.
[00:26:51.141 --> 00:26:53.561]  I just can't believe that this didn't blow up.
[00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:56.822]  Because there were teachers and people there, but they kind of went and hid behind everything.
[00:26:57.622 --> 00:26:59.103]  Man, I gotta tell you, this is unbelievable.
[00:26:59.603 --> 00:27:00.563]  Please go back to the raw footage.
[00:27:00.583 --> 00:27:06.845]  Why did you go back to New York when you came?
[00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:08.765]  This is not your land!
[00:27:18.934 --> 00:27:22.676]  I know y'all a little younger than me.
[00:27:22.696 --> 00:27:25.137]  So let me show y'all something.
[00:27:25.798 --> 00:27:28.639]  Go on YouTube, right?
[00:27:28.739 --> 00:27:31.561]  And you can look it up for yourself.
[00:27:31.641 --> 00:27:32.441]  Check this out.
[00:27:32.481 --> 00:27:33.502]  I'm gonna give y'all something.
[00:27:33.522 --> 00:27:34.002]  Check this out.
[00:27:34.442 --> 00:27:35.203]  Go on YouTube.
[00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:39.486]  And look up, that who Trump kisses drag.
[00:27:39.926 --> 00:27:44.889]  You're going to see your president kiss Rudy Giuliani dressed in a drag outfit.
[00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:48.372]  Your president is a homosexual.
[00:27:48.432 --> 00:27:52.595]  Your president is a homosexual.
[00:27:52.635 --> 00:27:53.415]  Pause again.
[00:27:53.455 --> 00:27:55.237]  Folks, it just goes on.
[00:27:55.277 --> 00:27:56.978]  We're going to organ harvest you.
[00:28:02.415 --> 00:28:03.515]  We're gonna kill you.
[00:28:04.456 --> 00:28:05.616]  You're a bunch of fags.
[00:28:05.896 --> 00:28:07.856]  And the media all know this.
[00:28:09.117 --> 00:28:10.817]  And dollars to donuts.
[00:28:12.358 --> 00:28:15.378]  That guy, this Native American guy, got flown in there.
[00:28:15.398 --> 00:28:18.499]  In fact, there's reports that he's a professional victim.
[00:28:19.259 --> 00:28:20.720]  And it's Soros funded as usual.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.060]  I mean, we know most of it is anyways.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:22.860]  The damn march is.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.701]  But this is how they're provocateuring.
[00:28:26.721 --> 00:28:27.562]  This is what they do.
[00:28:27.942 --> 00:28:29.142]  And if you go back to NPR,
[00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:31.902]  When we come back, we're going to play some more of this clip.
[00:28:32.183 --> 00:28:41.012]  There they are with CNN and everybody else still demonizing, still demonizing the children.
[00:28:41.532 --> 00:28:43.174]  A bunch of men with clubs.
[00:28:43.214 --> 00:28:43.794]  Oh, I forgot.
[00:28:43.894 --> 00:28:46.197]  They've got giant hickory stick clubs.
[00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:50.081]  Big men, big beers, big clubs.
[00:28:51.062 --> 00:28:52.703]  We're going to take your organs, kids.
[00:28:53.644 --> 00:28:54.325]  The president's
[00:28:57.482 --> 00:28:59.524]  It's just, it's insane!
[00:28:59.665 --> 00:29:00.666]  It's total evil!
[00:29:00.746 --> 00:29:01.767]  The media is pure evil!
[00:29:06.852 --> 00:29:18.824]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars, and yours truly, for selling high quality supplements.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:38.526]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[00:29:40.146 --> 00:29:42.207]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[00:29:42.587 --> 00:29:43.447]  Whole Foods was number two.
[00:29:44.287 --> 00:29:49.609]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[00:29:51.195 --> 00:29:57.459]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:12.429]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at InfoWarsLife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[00:30:13.329 --> 00:30:15.371]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[00:30:16.306 --> 00:30:19.213]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[00:30:19.373 --> 00:30:19.995]  No response.
[00:30:20.215 --> 00:30:21.198]  They never want to get my comment.
[00:30:21.518 --> 00:30:22.641]  Now, why am I saying that?
[00:30:23.924 --> 00:30:24.305]  It's simple.
[00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:29.900]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:36.465]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best, show.
[00:30:36.606 --> 00:30:37.466]  We have a great product.
[00:30:37.586 --> 00:30:38.007]  You love it.
[00:30:38.067 --> 00:30:38.687]  You reorder it.
[00:30:39.068 --> 00:30:41.329]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:43.711]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[00:30:43.872 --> 00:30:44.913]  It's a 360 win.
[00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:45.953]  We defeat them.
[00:30:46.033 --> 00:30:46.414]  You win.
[00:30:46.554 --> 00:30:46.874]  I win.
[00:30:47.174 --> 00:30:47.675]  It's amazing.
[00:30:49.548 --> 00:30:54.310]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:54.330 --> 00:31:09.956]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[00:31:11.877 --> 00:31:12.397]  It's hard to believe.
[00:31:12.477 --> 00:31:15.219]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[00:31:15.299 --> 00:31:22.783]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[00:31:23.623 --> 00:31:25.884]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[00:31:25.904 --> 00:31:35.409]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:36.230]  But just know this.
[00:31:38.226 --> 00:31:46.351]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:48.912]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[00:31:49.632 --> 00:32:00.158]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[00:32:00.778 --> 00:32:01.859]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[00:32:01.979 --> 00:32:02.640]  I'm garbage.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.281]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[00:32:05.481 --> 00:32:06.782]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[00:32:07.972 --> 00:32:09.335]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[00:32:09.957 --> 00:32:11.059]  Tumeric's dynamite.
[00:32:11.841 --> 00:32:13.485]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[00:32:14.647 --> 00:32:16.311]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[00:32:16.391 --> 00:32:17.093]  It's all dynamite.
[00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:21.370]  They can tell you how great it is, and show you all the facts, and tell you.
[00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:22.530]  Because they're the elite.
[00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:23.571]  I'm just scum.
[00:32:24.191 --> 00:32:25.111]  Just like you, according to them.
[00:32:25.151 --> 00:32:27.572]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[00:32:27.932 --> 00:32:32.114]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforwarslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[00:32:32.594 --> 00:32:37.675]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience Supramel Vitality, Supramel Vitality.
[00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:41.877]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, Supramel Vitality, Supramel.
[00:32:41.917 --> 00:32:47.999]  Because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:49.460]  Because it's so frustrating.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.662]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[00:32:52.822 --> 00:32:57.705]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at mfullwarsstore.com and mfullwarslife.com.
[00:32:57.885 --> 00:32:58.766]  Thanks for your support.
[00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:08.693]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.617 --> 00:33:28.758]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:29.478 --> 00:33:31.019]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:35.540]  You know those moments when light bulbs go off in your head and then more light bulbs go off?
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:41.321]  Because I remember the first time I ran into Antifa in Austin.
[00:33:41.341 --> 00:33:43.182]  I didn't know what Antifa was.
[00:33:44.266 --> 00:33:52.688]  And I was at a pro-gun march and they would come up and bump me in the back trying to get me to hit them while they had cameras on me to then set me up.
[00:33:53.388 --> 00:34:00.150]  And then I was at the DNC in Denver when Obama was running for office back in 2004.
[00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.291]  No, that was Bush.
[00:34:03.331 --> 00:34:04.051]  That was 2008.
[00:34:04.931 --> 00:34:07.552]  And it was the same groups trying the same stuff.
[00:34:08.689 --> 00:34:12.470]  And they would come up and say, F you and your family and your mother, and we're going to do all this stuff to you.
[00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.211]  And then go, Hey, Alex, leave us alone.
[00:34:14.231 --> 00:34:14.951]  What's the problem?
[00:34:15.491 --> 00:34:16.391]  And I wasn't understanding.
[00:34:16.411 --> 00:34:17.872]  They were trying to provocateur me.
[00:34:17.952 --> 00:34:23.153]  I knew that, but for an edit to make it look like I was doing something I hadn't.
[00:34:24.354 --> 00:34:25.634]  So they've got trained provocateurs.
[00:34:25.674 --> 00:34:32.336]  So I was on air earlier talking about how a quote group of Native American women, they didn't look Native American to me.
[00:34:32.356 --> 00:34:37.778]  They looked a Meso American, but the point is they came up and
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:43.903]  Started cussing at me, blowing smoke in my face, telling me, you know, get out of here, white man.
[00:34:43.923 --> 00:34:46.805]  Again, your mother's married to her brother.
[00:34:48.326 --> 00:34:49.107]  You're a monkey.
[00:34:51.228 --> 00:34:51.949]  I've played it before.
[00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:52.569]  You can go find it.
[00:34:52.589 --> 00:34:53.750]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:54.991]  But it goes to this.
[00:34:55.591 --> 00:35:03.817]  And then the same group broke it, edited, showing something completely and totally different.
[00:35:03.897 --> 00:35:04.378]  Now this.
[00:35:05.717 --> 00:35:12.901]  So now this broke this both times, and I said, I bet this Native American dude is a provocateur paid to be there.
[00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:19.304]  Because you know, most of the women there protesting Kavanaugh the time I was there, were paid to be there and got caught being paid.
[00:35:19.904 --> 00:35:21.265]  But now I realize they are, folks.
[00:35:22.145 --> 00:35:29.449]  Because the women would F you, say all these horrible things, and then lean back and go, I'm a veteran, I'm a citizen, how dare you say mean things to me?
[00:35:30.049 --> 00:35:32.010]  And I was like, that's weird, you're saying the mean stuff.
[00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.211]  It's because they had a film crew with them!
[00:35:35.472 --> 00:35:37.614]  They just call their people and, hey, we got Jones out here.
[00:35:37.634 --> 00:35:42.997]  I was out there like 30 minutes on the street corner, and they swagger up and stage their event.
[00:35:45.659 --> 00:35:46.560]  Whole world's a stage.
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:53.345]  Well, it turns out this individual, Nathan Phillips, is a professional troublemaker.
[00:35:54.245 --> 00:35:58.548]  He claims racial harassment by EMU students dressed as Indians.
[00:35:58.568 --> 00:36:05.173]  He was walking around the campus and saw a group, a Native American-themed party, and went over and got in a confrontation with them.
[00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:11.989]  And now he takes offense, and he's a victim, and oh, they were trying to do bad things.
[00:36:12.409 --> 00:36:14.511]  He said, oh, I felt like they were going to hit me.
[00:36:15.032 --> 00:36:15.432]  Same thing.
[00:36:16.053 --> 00:36:16.753]  He's on NPR.
[00:36:17.414 --> 00:36:18.755]  I was scared for us.
[00:36:18.795 --> 00:36:21.417]  The mean people were doing bad things.
[00:36:21.497 --> 00:36:22.898]  I felt like they were going to attack us.
[00:36:22.938 --> 00:36:28.463]  Meanwhile, it's a bunch of students sitting there with their red, white, and blue school outfits on.
[00:36:28.743 --> 00:36:29.664]  A few are Trump hats.
[00:36:29.724 --> 00:36:30.545]  It's a pro-life march.
[00:36:32.438 --> 00:36:33.819]  Everybody's like, see the hats, see the hats?
[00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:35.520]  Hey, we're gonna kill your ass!
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.621]  Yeah, honky asses!
[00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:39.782]  We're coming over there, we're gonna harvest your organ!
[00:36:40.022 --> 00:36:42.203]  You little black kids with them, you're dead!
[00:36:45.945 --> 00:36:46.666]  That's all the audio.
[00:36:46.686 --> 00:36:47.646]  You can go watch it and listen to it.
[00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:48.407]  We just played some of it.
[00:36:49.608 --> 00:36:52.989]  And by the time the media gets done, it's, did you see those criminals?
[00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:57.132]  Did you see those vicious white supremacist devils being mean to that old elder?
[00:36:57.472 --> 00:37:00.994]  And it turns out, he did the same thing to college students a few years ago.
[00:37:02.816 --> 00:37:03.777]  Fox 2 Detroit.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:14.169]  So this is his profession, and he's all upset by them, and he felt threatened by a Native American-themed party.
[00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:17.192]  Poor thing.
[00:37:17.212 --> 00:37:18.614]  That was 2015.
[00:37:20.015 --> 00:37:21.157]  So there you go, folks.
[00:37:21.217 --> 00:37:22.138]  That's the shtick.
[00:37:24.625 --> 00:37:27.930]  That's the whole stage schtick that they are engaged in.
[00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:29.752]  And they think you're stupid.
[00:37:30.113 --> 00:37:31.094]  They think you're idiots.
[00:37:31.434 --> 00:37:32.556]  They think you're morons.
[00:37:33.697 --> 00:37:35.139]  And you have NPR.
[00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:36.421]  Oh, there it is.
[00:37:36.481 --> 00:37:38.724]  The power of Nathan Phillips' song.
[00:37:38.885 --> 00:37:40.967]  Oh, he's been in vogue!
[00:37:42.273 --> 00:37:46.976]  Last year, oh, oh, he gets harassed in every town he goes to.
[00:37:47.036 --> 00:37:49.217]  He says, America's bad.
[00:37:49.757 --> 00:37:51.398]  And he makes a full living, it turns out.
[00:37:51.779 --> 00:38:01.845]  So in just a few minutes of searching who this guy is, we learn the whole thing's as phony, as a plastic banana, or as a $3 bill.
[00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:04.033]  There you go.
[00:38:04.814 --> 00:38:07.114]  We're just having the understanding here on air, researching together.
[00:38:07.134 --> 00:38:09.035]  They're in their search engineering and we're learning.
[00:38:09.055 --> 00:38:10.556]  Oh, there he is on NowThis.
[00:38:11.236 --> 00:38:12.997]  Oh, that poor baby.
[00:38:13.817 --> 00:38:19.219]  Men with clubs saying, we're going to kill you to a group of children as young as seven.
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:21.100]  And the mean show.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.481]  And he, he went on NPR.
[00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:23.021]  We played it earlier.
[00:38:23.061 --> 00:38:23.981]  Let's, let's start from the beginning.
[00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:29.724]  He went on NPR and they sounded like Ka from Jungle Book, the presenter and him just, and
[00:38:33.286 --> 00:38:38.248]  How threatening it was that a group of pro-lifers were waiting for a bus.
[00:38:39.009 --> 00:38:46.152]  Now just let us change your gender and take some Rozac and this will be very easy for you.
[00:38:47.052 --> 00:38:52.894]  So let's go ahead and roll the NPR CAW audio of this professional agitator.
[00:38:53.495 --> 00:38:56.176]  Search I bet money he's funded by Soros Foundation.
[00:38:57.179 --> 00:38:58.699]  Nobody wants to bet me in their control room.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.300]  Look at who this guy's funded by.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:03.881]  Type in his name and then type in grants.
[00:39:04.441 --> 00:39:05.262]  Sponsorship.
[00:39:05.662 --> 00:39:07.682]  Oh, we're gonna find out real fast.
[00:39:08.202 --> 00:39:13.104]  You're like, who marches and tries to lead a crowd in to attack kids?
[00:39:14.625 --> 00:39:16.525]  That's in the Antifa documents we've gotten.
[00:39:17.025 --> 00:39:23.447]  They go to black neighborhoods, they have white agitators mainly, dressed up as Antifa in masks trying to get them to start a race war.
[00:39:23.967 --> 00:39:25.348]  That's in the documents we got last January.
[00:39:26.374 --> 00:39:27.496]  So let's go back to the NPR piece.
[00:39:27.516 --> 00:39:27.837]  Here it is.
[00:39:35.169 --> 00:39:43.176]  Under the impression or making an assumption that a large group of young white men might threaten a minority who you saw.
[00:39:43.196 --> 00:39:53.965]  And you saw this group of black Hebrew Israelites as potentially in danger by this large group of white men based on what you had seen in the news in our country in recent months and years.
[00:39:54.426 --> 00:39:54.646]  Yes.
[00:39:55.567 --> 00:40:01.652]  Thank you for that clarity because that's what it was in my mind and in my heart.
[00:40:02.973 --> 00:40:19.442]  Because when I seen those young men, I was seeing their faces, and the thing is, is that those young men could have chose to not feed into those guys, those Israelite fellas.
[00:40:20.023 --> 00:40:29.548]  They could have chose, the students' teachers, the students' chaperones, could have instructed those students to exit that area.
[00:40:31.209 --> 00:40:36.834]  This wasn't something that they needed to bring their high schools into and be involved in.
[00:40:37.034 --> 00:40:38.555]  Can I ask a question this way?
[00:40:39.176 --> 00:40:48.684]  How much of what you were feeling was based on an assumption that a large group of young white men
[00:40:50.153 --> 00:41:02.396]  We're outnumbering a small group of black protesters and assuming that this could be very tense and there could be racism and how much of it was about things you were actually hearing?
[00:41:03.076 --> 00:41:07.657]  Well, the thing is, yeah, the thing is that there was no assumption that there was a large group.
[00:41:07.917 --> 00:41:10.518]  There was a large group and there was only four black men.
[00:41:11.238 --> 00:41:13.039]  And so there's no assumption there.
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.223]  The young man who was standing in front of you has identified himself in a statement as Nick Sandman.
[00:41:18.464 --> 00:41:23.007]  And, um, you know, he said that he was intimidated by these other protesters.
[00:41:23.027 --> 00:41:24.528]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:41:24.568 --> 00:41:28.912]  So you've got a group of school children, some as young as age 7, waiting for a bus.
[00:41:30.402 --> 00:41:32.083]  And first it's, oh, they blocked the steps.
[00:41:32.103 --> 00:41:33.344]  Well, the footage is the steps aren't blocked.
[00:41:33.364 --> 00:41:34.324]  They're not sitting on the steps.
[00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:35.665]  They're sitting over on the side.
[00:41:36.085 --> 00:41:38.607]  Next it's, oh, I felt scared there were white people.
[00:41:38.647 --> 00:41:40.167]  Yeah, you're so damn racist.
[00:41:40.508 --> 00:41:41.708]  Oh, now it's only four black guys.
[00:41:41.728 --> 00:41:42.849]  You mean the four black Israelites.
[00:41:42.989 --> 00:41:47.111]  There's a whole group of people from the women's march screaming and yelling at them.
[00:41:47.311 --> 00:41:49.833]  But there's a group of about 15, 20, 30 people you let over.
[00:41:50.973 --> 00:41:55.956]  And then everybody's sitting there, jumping up and down on the footage at first when he walks over with a drum.
[00:41:56.036 --> 00:41:57.197]  They're being really nice kids.
[00:41:59.005 --> 00:42:00.746]  I'm really surprised how nice these children were.
[00:42:01.486 --> 00:42:06.288]  But again, the reason I've spent so much time on this is, this is the anatomy of fraud.
[00:42:07.088 --> 00:42:09.849]  This is the anatomy of how the left always are professional victims.
[00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:16.372]  And you hear this individual, quote, Native American veteran, Nathan Phillips,
[00:42:17.847 --> 00:42:20.068]  Talking about how there were black people he had to protect.
[00:42:20.308 --> 00:42:21.608]  Oh, a virtue signaler.
[00:42:22.308 --> 00:42:33.932]  So the way he protects them is running over to the group trying to keep black babies from being killed, because they're Christian, and projecting onto them all their racism, all their hate, all their ignorance, all their stupidity.
[00:42:36.532 --> 00:42:41.154]  And of course, now we learn little girls were also harassed by these folks.
[00:42:41.454 --> 00:42:41.854]  Well, yeah.
[00:42:42.773 --> 00:42:50.998]  Because you've got a bunch of paid provocateurs trying to get a riot going there so they can say that this group of Trump supporters did this.
[00:42:52.139 --> 00:42:58.083]  The corporate press is America's enemy and it's waging war against the people and it's moving us towards open civil war.
[00:42:58.723 --> 00:43:00.064]  We must stop this now!
[00:43:05.751 --> 00:43:08.433]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[00:43:08.773 --> 00:43:14.676]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[00:43:15.216 --> 00:43:27.223]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[00:44:03.075 --> 00:44:03.615]  Here's the thing.
[00:44:03.675 --> 00:44:05.056]  I know how metaphysics works.
[00:44:05.116 --> 00:44:06.256]  I know how the universe works.
[00:44:06.936 --> 00:44:08.997]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:44:10.217 --> 00:44:13.819]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:44:14.739 --> 00:44:17.940]  I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.541]  And that would be a very true statement.
[00:44:21.381 --> 00:44:27.563]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[00:44:28.603 --> 00:44:30.064]  If I fight as hard as I can,
[00:44:31.864 --> 00:44:33.565]  And people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:40.128]  You support us and get creative and get fired up, we won't just be here a hundred years, we'll be here forever.
[00:44:40.508 --> 00:44:41.608]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:44:42.789 --> 00:44:50.992]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what, are gonna look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[00:44:51.372 --> 00:44:55.554]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put and blessed, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[00:44:56.114 --> 00:44:58.875]  We're proud of what we brought you and the whole family of InfoWars products.
[00:44:59.315 --> 00:45:00.476]  Without you, we won't be here.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.442]  Today's left thinks that America is just another country.
[00:45:06.283 --> 00:45:09.305]  Just one of the 190 some countries on the planet.
[00:45:09.685 --> 00:45:11.927]  United States of America is not just another country.
[00:45:12.287 --> 00:45:18.632]  It's the greatest nation in history that has done more good for more people than any country ever.
[00:45:18.952 --> 00:45:22.114]  A special place where people from all over the world
[00:45:23.235 --> 00:45:33.405]  All shapes, all sizes, all colors, all talents come to so they can chase down their goals, chase down their dreams, make life better for themselves and their family.
[00:45:33.445 --> 00:45:34.406]  That's this country.
[00:45:35.047 --> 00:45:42.775]  A special place where people come and respect the Constitution, cherish the Bill of Rights, and embrace the rule of law.
[00:45:43.375 --> 00:45:46.538]  Democrat Congressman Blumenauer said, abolish ICE.
[00:45:47.771 --> 00:45:53.736]  Secretary Clinton, when she was running for the highest office in the land, said we need a borderless hemisphere.
[00:45:53.816 --> 00:46:06.906]  We've learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, I will continue speaking out for comprehensive immigration reform.
[00:46:07.147 --> 00:46:11.110]  I think the people who are here deserve a path to citizenship.
[00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:12.071]  Speaker Pelosi,
[00:46:12.851 --> 00:46:14.171]  ...said walls are immoral.
[00:46:14.231 --> 00:46:15.952]  A wall is an immorality.
[00:46:16.052 --> 00:46:23.993]  Just last week, Stacey Abrams, governor candidate, state of Georgia, said non-citizens should be able to vote.
[00:46:24.233 --> 00:46:24.813]  Think about that.
[00:46:25.054 --> 00:46:28.834]  So in some cases you would be supportive of non-citizens voting?
[00:46:28.954 --> 00:46:29.634]  I wouldn't oppose it.
[00:46:29.915 --> 00:46:31.595]  She wouldn't oppose it.
[00:46:31.615 --> 00:46:36.736]  Sounds like she is open to non-citizens voting in local elections.
[00:46:36.756 --> 00:46:39.897]  Americans believe that borders need to be strong.
[00:46:40.157 --> 00:46:41.777]  Americans believe, we believe,
[00:46:42.197 --> 00:47:01.943]  That there's a difference, a big difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration, and Americans and Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus believe that a border security wall will help stop drug problem, the gang problem, and the human trafficking problem.
[00:47:06.985 --> 00:47:09.606]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:18.471]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:47:18.952 --> 00:47:24.176]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:47:27.459 --> 00:47:38.249]  We've now moved on from the two-year fake Russia hoax, the witch hunt, where it goes into an inquisition and they start persecuting everybody and overturning the 2016 election.
[00:47:40.237 --> 00:47:55.627]  Because we've been this persecuted and this targeted and set up as a straw man for the entire fall of America and the takedown of the president and our republic itself, literally, we are in the eye of the hurricane and are able to see things and know things others don't.
[00:47:56.148 --> 00:47:58.189]  In fact, I'm not scared of Robert Mueller III.
[00:47:58.229 --> 00:48:02.692]  I'm not scared of all these white shoe boy lawyers and wannabe tough guys, okay?
[00:48:02.812 --> 00:48:07.976]  I know I've been put in this place by God, and there's your support and prayers to now face this test.
[00:48:08.756 --> 00:48:11.197]  I fear for our children and the country and the world.
[00:48:12.218 --> 00:48:20.783]  This spirit of fear and this spirit of bullying from the left and the deep state and the rogue state and the globalist is permeating this country.
[00:48:21.363 --> 00:48:27.326]  This is a group of criminals and we will defeat these terrorists.
[00:48:27.466 --> 00:48:32.189]  Now Roger Stone's here with
[00:48:33.803 --> 00:48:37.426]  Absolute bombshell information concerning the move to take down the president.
[00:48:37.466 --> 00:48:38.707]  Remember, Russiagate is that.
[00:48:39.467 --> 00:48:40.368]  Everybody knows it's a fraud.
[00:48:40.388 --> 00:48:41.008]  People ignore it.
[00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:42.469]  The left isn't.
[00:48:42.509 --> 00:48:43.310]  The globalists aren't.
[00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:46.892]  This is their vehicle to install Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton on record.
[00:48:47.933 --> 00:48:48.994]  And we can stop it together.
[00:48:49.334 --> 00:48:53.697]  That's why if you're listening on local radio or watching on TV, you've got to tell folks every day about it.
[00:48:53.837 --> 00:48:57.339]  You've got to take the live feed at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:48:58.283 --> 00:49:02.546]  And the live article we do every day for the show where we describe what the show is about that day.
[00:49:03.006 --> 00:49:14.634]  How the whole claim that this poor Native American was surrounded by evil white kids and they're all terrorists and their school needs to be blown up and they need to be murdered.
[00:49:14.674 --> 00:49:17.435]  This is what Democrats are saying on Twitter and Twitter's allowing it.
[00:49:17.816 --> 00:49:18.796]  I know this sounds insane.
[00:49:18.836 --> 00:49:21.558]  We have articles on Infowars.com showing all this.
[00:49:23.059 --> 00:49:26.581]  Turns out, I said, you know, look into him being professionally paid by Soros.
[00:49:27.302 --> 00:49:27.582]  Boom!
[00:49:29.295 --> 00:49:33.978]  Turns out he goes on universities and starts fights and tries to file lawsuits all over the country.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:43.284]  And the same group that's funded by Soros and Facebook did the same thing to me a few months ago when I was in D.C.
[00:49:43.304 --> 00:49:44.685]  saying I harassed Native American women.
[00:49:44.885 --> 00:49:52.891]  They came over and said, eff you, blew smoke in my face, said you're a monkey, whites are subhuman, everything else, my mother's married to her brother.
[00:49:53.959 --> 00:49:56.961]  I'm an inbred honky, and the news, you edited the tape.
[00:49:56.981 --> 00:50:12.193]  And I kept wondering, because I'm not that slick, I kept wondering, again, why she'd say, F you and your family, you white scum, trying to provocateur me, and then I would lean back and she'd go, I'm just a veteran, a nice woman, why are you doing this?
[00:50:13.274 --> 00:50:14.655]  Because they were getting the edits.
[00:50:16.456 --> 00:50:20.119]  You have to understand, these people are pure deception.
[00:50:22.381 --> 00:50:23.602]  It's who they are.
[00:50:24.963 --> 00:50:27.045]  Now joining us is Roger Stone for this segment and the next.
[00:50:27.105 --> 00:50:36.914]  And then, Jan Irving is the guy that launched, or helped launch, the modern DMT operation.
[00:50:36.934 --> 00:50:37.654]  And he's a good guy.
[00:50:37.694 --> 00:50:38.635]  He didn't understand what was happening.
[00:50:38.655 --> 00:50:40.497]  It was being used by the CIA.
[00:50:40.537 --> 00:50:41.778]  He later learned who was doing it.
[00:50:42.699 --> 00:50:44.701]  And this isn't so much an expose of Joe Rogan.
[00:50:45.221 --> 00:50:51.287]  It's just something I've got to do about the DMT situation and about unfinished business
[00:50:52.714 --> 00:50:58.516]  On things where I was so loyal to some people that I just kind of blotted it out of my head with what I saw right in front of me.
[00:50:58.876 --> 00:51:02.117]  And I talked to Jan Irving and others to just confirm my worst fears.
[00:51:03.237 --> 00:51:07.798]  So that's all coming up for about an hour and a half of the broadcast starting in about 25 minutes.
[00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:08.838]  He'll be joining us.
[00:51:08.858 --> 00:51:10.159]  We're a little bit behind today, but he's coming up.
[00:51:10.179 --> 00:51:10.859]  We appreciate him.
[00:51:11.679 --> 00:51:12.779]  Okay, Roger Stone.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.241]  The obvious giant bombshell as we can encapsulate it in the seven minutes we have in this segment.
[00:51:17.261 --> 00:51:19.941]  We'll play the clip of Giuliani as well last night confirming it.
[00:51:24.702 --> 00:51:29.967]  I have been a target, as Michael Caputo and others said, the grand jury and the questions and many other witnesses you've talked to.
[00:51:30.347 --> 00:51:32.930]  The media tries to deny this because they don't want us to have any support.
[00:51:33.671 --> 00:51:42.359]  But the fact that they're trying to prepare at the end of the witch hunt to get you, my dad, and myself shows how empty the Russia collusion was and how crazy this is.
[00:51:42.979 --> 00:51:48.404]  But now, of course, he's backing off what the Washington Post and others told us, that he was the source saying that
[00:51:49.264 --> 00:51:58.872]  We hired him for hush money and then we paid out half a year of his contract when I had to let him go, which I do for senior people who've done that many times, that that's hush money.
[00:51:58.892 --> 00:51:59.852]  He says he never said that.
[00:51:59.873 --> 00:52:03.636]  So I want to believe, Corsi, is that true or where is this coming from?
[00:52:03.656 --> 00:52:08.980]  Because he's now said, he won't say it's totally false, he says it's ridiculous and crazy and defamatory.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:12.783]  I mean, okay, Corsi, so you never told Mueller this?
[00:52:13.143 --> 00:52:15.385]  Because we know he said things about you previously that were not true.
[00:52:15.625 --> 00:52:16.486]  What's happening here, Roger?
[00:52:17.543 --> 00:52:22.187]  Yeah, Alex, I'm really getting tired of Jerry Corsi's, you know, George Washington act.
[00:52:22.307 --> 00:52:23.969]  Oh, I will not tell a lie.
[00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:27.852]  Well, in all honesty, unfortunately, the good doctors told a number of lies.
[00:52:28.272 --> 00:52:30.715]  In fact, he's starting to conflate his lies.
[00:52:31.255 --> 00:52:36.620]  So he now says that he wasn't willing to say lies about the president.
[00:52:37.401 --> 00:52:51.893]  And that they told him that he would receive probation for some charge if he would testify against Donald J. Trump, but that they would send him to prison for five years if he would not, but he was perfectly willing to lie about me.
[00:52:51.913 --> 00:52:59.159]  Now, fortunately, I have the emails and the text messages and the metadata to demonstrate that everything he said is a lie.
[00:52:59.579 --> 00:53:01.481]  No, Jerry, you never told me that
[00:53:02.142 --> 00:53:04.203]  John Podesta's emails have been boosted.
[00:53:05.144 --> 00:53:08.045]  You said on Tucker Carlson you told everybody that.
[00:53:08.125 --> 00:53:11.127]  You said on MSNBC you told many people that.
[00:53:11.207 --> 00:53:13.689]  I don't think you told anybody that because you didn't know it.
[00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:19.652]  Now you're saying that I told you ahead of the NBC tape
[00:53:20.192 --> 00:53:20.572]  I don't know.
[00:53:40.322 --> 00:53:46.229]  What do you make of Giuliani confirming, because I guess they have a joint defense agreement,
[00:53:59.517 --> 00:54:08.807]  What do you make of Giuliani, again the chief lawyer for Trump on the whole fake Russiagate thing, on CNN saying that indeed they've given him a script to lie about.
[00:54:09.127 --> 00:54:10.409]  If he won't lie, he's going to prison.
[00:54:10.449 --> 00:54:14.193]  I mean, that's confirming that they're giving him this script and telling him the lie.
[00:54:14.213 --> 00:54:16.656]  Because it's not just coming from Corsi now, it's coming from Giuliani.
[00:54:17.532 --> 00:54:18.813]  I believe that to be the case.
[00:54:18.893 --> 00:54:20.655]  So in other words, let's walk through this.
[00:54:21.296 --> 00:54:24.119]  They told Corsi exactly what Giuliani said.
[00:54:24.159 --> 00:54:26.241]  If you lie about Donald Trump, we'll give you a pass.
[00:54:26.761 --> 00:54:28.783]  If you don't lie about him, we're sending you to jail.
[00:54:29.304 --> 00:54:32.507]  Jerry said, well, what if I only lie about Roger Stone and Alex Jones?
[00:54:32.527 --> 00:54:34.169]  What if I don't implicate the president?
[00:54:34.189 --> 00:54:35.350]  Could we still make a deal?
[00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:38.093]  My guess is that Mueller rejected that deal.
[00:54:38.613 --> 00:54:43.294]  The three things that he has said in leaked portions of his book about me are demonstrably false.
[00:54:43.714 --> 00:54:44.855]  That's the defamation.
[00:54:45.335 --> 00:54:46.435]  Here's the bad news, Jerry.
[00:54:46.775 --> 00:54:47.595]  God's with me.
[00:54:47.875 --> 00:54:48.755]  God is with Alex.
[00:54:48.855 --> 00:54:53.156]  God knows that you're bearing false witness against us in violation of his commandments.
[00:54:53.176 --> 00:54:57.818]  So quit hiding behind God in your phony, baloney, trumped-up tweets.
[00:54:58.198 --> 00:54:59.658]  Nobody's buying your crap.
[00:55:01.003 --> 00:55:02.944]  I think you've been deep state from the beginning.
[00:55:03.245 --> 00:55:07.368]  Your whole birther thing is used as a club to destroy conservatives.
[00:55:07.508 --> 00:55:10.470]  Isn't it ironic that MSNBC is happy to have you on?
[00:55:10.871 --> 00:55:12.612]  That CNN embraces you?
[00:55:12.712 --> 00:55:21.339]  Why are all these deep state assets now trying to make you a truth teller when what you're trying to do is take down Alex Jones and InfoWars and yours truly?
[00:55:21.379 --> 00:55:23.341]  So I look forward to our confrontation.
[00:55:23.801 --> 00:55:24.922]  I will demolish you.
[00:55:25.162 --> 00:55:26.163]  You're a fraudster.
[00:55:26.643 --> 00:55:35.769]  Out of your alcoholic haze, you have made up lies about David Jones and Alex Jones and Roger Stone, and now I suspect they want you to lie about the President.
[00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:39.672]  Now, two things have come forward here that have not been previously reported.
[00:55:40.152 --> 00:55:43.457]  Dr. Corsi has a joint defense agreement with the President.
[00:55:43.497 --> 00:55:46.942]  That means Giuliani is privy to those documents.
[00:55:47.062 --> 00:55:49.726]  I believe that Mayor Giuliani is telling the truth.
[00:55:50.146 --> 00:55:54.032]  Secondarily, Jerry Corsi met privately with candidate Donald J. Trump.
[00:55:54.232 --> 00:55:55.073]  I was not present.
[00:55:55.534 --> 00:55:57.036]  I don't know what was discussed.
[00:55:57.396 --> 00:56:09.926]  So perhaps the special counsel has suggested to Jerry that he make up what was discussed in that meeting just as they suggested to him that he claimed that he told me that John Podesta's emails had been stolen.
[00:56:10.167 --> 00:56:11.588]  Never said anything of the kind.
[00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:14.670]  No email, no text message, no corroboration of that.
[00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:16.211]  We're going to break in a moment.
[00:56:16.492 --> 00:56:17.673]  Yes, let's go out to break.
[00:56:17.713 --> 00:56:18.313]  We'll come back with more.
[00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:22.216]  But here's Giuliani on CNN confirming what course he's up to.
[00:56:22.256 --> 00:56:22.597]  Here it is.
[00:56:23.491 --> 00:56:25.193]  And I'm emphasizing the following.
[00:56:25.714 --> 00:56:29.438]  Do not think that just because he's pleading guilty to something, Michael Cohen's telling the truth.
[00:56:30.039 --> 00:56:33.302]  He's got every reason to say what the prosecutor wants him to say.
[00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:36.606]  Corsi, they're offering Corsi a deal right now.
[00:56:36.946 --> 00:56:39.849]  If he says what they want him to say, he gets probation.
[00:56:40.762 --> 00:56:43.044]  They're offering Corsi, how do you know this?
[00:56:43.464 --> 00:56:44.104]  That they're offering Corsi?
[00:56:44.124 --> 00:56:44.985]  Because he's suing over.
[00:56:45.705 --> 00:56:46.506]  I have the documents.
[00:56:46.866 --> 00:56:47.867]  I have the documents.
[00:56:47.927 --> 00:56:48.708]  It was leaked to me.
[00:56:49.368 --> 00:56:50.169]  I have the documents.
[00:56:50.269 --> 00:56:51.430]  They gave him a script.
[00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:54.111]  If he reads from the script, no jail.
[00:56:54.652 --> 00:56:57.754]  If he doesn't read from the script, he gets maybe five years in jail.
[00:56:57.774 --> 00:57:01.136]  So you are... So what's the temptation to read from the script?
[00:57:01.517 --> 00:57:05.960]  If you are a guy like Cohen, who was a lawyer taping his own client,
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.461]  And lying to him about it.
[00:57:07.681 --> 00:57:10.883]  Taping Chris Cuomo and lying to him about it.
[00:57:11.303 --> 00:57:14.164]  Stealing money back when he was fiercely loyal.
[00:57:14.625 --> 00:57:17.626]  In this transaction that was just uncovered, he kept $37,000.
[00:57:17.706 --> 00:57:20.828]  So let me just ask you a kind of false influence.
[00:57:20.848 --> 00:57:23.490]  The guy is a complete scoundrel!
[00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:26.051]  You can't believe him!
[00:57:26.331 --> 00:57:29.453]  Not only is Mueller saying that isn't true in the BuzzFeed report,
[00:57:30.737 --> 00:57:31.898]  Who cares what Cohen says?
[00:57:31.938 --> 00:57:33.659]  He's been admitted lying over and over again.
[00:57:33.919 --> 00:57:35.700]  All the crimes he's involved in has nothing to do with Trump.
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:40.222]  You can't listen to a convicted lying scumbag person.
[00:57:40.462 --> 00:57:43.564]  But the media's like, Cohen says Trump sent him to lie!
[00:57:43.584 --> 00:57:44.665]  It's all over for Trump!
[00:57:44.965 --> 00:57:46.166]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[00:57:46.186 --> 00:57:46.646]  Stay with us.
[00:57:46.666 --> 00:57:48.827]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:57:48.847 --> 00:57:49.647]  Spread the live links.
[00:57:49.888 --> 00:57:50.748]  Defeat the censors.
[00:57:50.808 --> 00:57:51.248]  Victory!
[00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:53.870]  Here's the thing.
[00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:55.311]  I know how metaphysics work.
[00:57:55.411 --> 00:57:56.531]  I know how the universe works.
[00:57:57.212 --> 00:57:59.253]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:04.051]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:58:04.651 --> 00:58:07.072]  There is no set stasis.
[00:58:08.592 --> 00:58:09.813]  There is no managed system.
[00:58:11.033 --> 00:58:14.534]  There is no... ...uncontinuum.
[00:58:15.354 --> 00:58:20.996]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:58:21.056 --> 00:58:29.498]  So... I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[00:58:30.782 --> 00:58:32.143]  And that would be a very true statement.
[00:58:32.984 --> 00:58:39.130]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[00:58:40.211 --> 00:58:45.115]  If I fight as hard as I can, and people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[00:58:46.597 --> 00:58:51.721]  You support us and get creative and get fired up, we won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[00:58:52.122 --> 00:58:53.203]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:58:54.369 --> 00:59:02.581]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[00:59:02.961 --> 00:59:08.409]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[00:59:08.429 --> 00:59:09.891]  Like Christ said, I have other flocks.
[00:59:09.911 --> 00:59:11.293]  It's a lot of eggs.
[00:59:12.455 --> 00:59:13.035]  God's big.
[00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:14.577]  God makes a lot of stuff, you know?
[00:59:15.057 --> 00:59:16.798]  And, you know, I want to be on the winning team.
[00:59:16.878 --> 00:59:18.840]  I want to like, hey, hey, come on in.
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:19.600]  You made it.
[00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.561]  Good to have you here.
[00:59:21.281 --> 00:59:27.726]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:59:28.727 --> 00:59:30.428]  And so this is playland.
[00:59:30.508 --> 00:59:31.529]  This is baby town.
[00:59:32.089 --> 00:59:32.870]  This is dress up.
[00:59:32.890 --> 00:59:35.632]  This is like little boys playing soldier in the woods.
[00:59:36.272 --> 00:59:39.214]  All I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[00:59:40.195 --> 00:59:41.216]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:59:42.253 --> 00:59:45.614]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[00:59:46.055 --> 00:59:47.175]  Not these devil worshippers.
[00:59:47.195 --> 00:59:49.916]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:59:50.076 --> 00:59:50.916]  I want life!
[00:59:51.477 --> 00:59:52.337]  I want Jesus!
[00:59:52.357 --> 01:00:00.700]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:13.602 --> 01:00:19.855]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.771 --> 01:00:28.592]  Thumb, the FBI mafia's fixer man.
[01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.734]  And yes, we know Corsi even bragged about it.
[01:00:31.754 --> 01:00:40.597]  But then I ran into FBI agents and others over the years, including some connected to folks that work here, family members that said, oh, Corsi, yeah, he's worked for the FBI for 20 years.
[01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.158]  You know, he's a great guy, blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:42.558 --> 01:00:43.458]  Covert stuff in Europe.
[01:00:43.478 --> 01:00:44.539]  It's true, he worked for the State Department.
[01:00:44.879 --> 01:00:47.340]  The guy's a spook back and forth in different agencies.
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:51.582]  And really, from my understanding, he used that for business connections and things.
[01:00:51.902 --> 01:00:53.183]  He's written a bunch of bestselling books.
[01:00:53.223 --> 01:00:54.043]  He's super smart.
[01:00:54.563 --> 01:00:56.764]  Unless you catch him when he can't walk, literally.
[01:00:57.424 --> 01:01:02.827]  And, you know, just the idea that either Mueller came up with this, or the Washington Post made it up, or Corsi made it up.
[01:01:03.087 --> 01:01:04.688]  And there's different combinations of those.
[01:01:05.148 --> 01:01:08.910]  Roger Stone, you were wanting to say something before we hit break about Giuliani and then get to that.
[01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:11.491]  Gut level, you've been all inside this every angle.
[01:01:11.531 --> 01:01:12.171]  We've talked about it.
[01:01:12.571 --> 01:01:14.632]  You think Corsi made this up, not Mueller.
[01:01:14.892 --> 01:01:19.814]  Not to defend Mueller, you just think this is like, here, I'll throw you Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[01:01:19.854 --> 01:01:20.775]  I mean, go ahead.
[01:01:21.607 --> 01:01:32.415]  Well, the way this usually works, of course, Alex, is that after they've been in your emails, your text messages, your phone calls for two years, they come up with these constructed, fabricated narratives.
[01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:37.939]  Then they suggest the narrative to Jerry and Jerry says, oh, yeah, yeah, that's how it was.
[01:01:37.999 --> 01:01:38.439]  Exactly.
[01:01:38.499 --> 01:01:40.100]  I'll say that to get off the hook.
[01:01:40.661 --> 01:01:44.304]  So you'll give us Stone, you'll give us Jones, you'll give us David Jones.
[01:01:44.804 --> 01:01:46.385]  Oh, Jerry, there's one more thing.
[01:01:46.925 --> 01:01:48.947]  We need you to give us Donald J. Trump.
[01:01:49.637 --> 01:01:52.158]  Now he says, oh, I wasn't willing to do that.
[01:01:52.198 --> 01:01:55.039]  Well, what lie is it they wanted him to tell about Trump?
[01:01:55.759 --> 01:02:01.380]  This fabrication that Jerry knew about the WikiLeaks disclosures?
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:05.041]  Well, Julian Assange announced that on CNN in June of 2016.
[01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:08.142]  Not exactly a state secret.
[01:02:08.162 --> 01:02:10.223]  He repeated it on Fox in August of 2016.
[01:02:10.283 --> 01:02:11.443]  So here's the bottom line.
[01:02:11.483 --> 01:02:12.583]  Where do you see this going?
[01:02:12.663 --> 01:02:13.804]  Where is the Russiagate going?
[01:02:13.824 --> 01:02:15.424]  It's supposed to be over by February.
[01:02:15.904 --> 01:02:17.285]  Now they're talking about six more months.
[01:02:17.345 --> 01:02:17.965]  It just never ends.
[01:02:19.073 --> 01:02:23.498]  Well, look, the Deep State is committed to removing this president one way or another.
[01:02:23.658 --> 01:02:27.102]  I'm deeply disturbed by this tweet I saw today from Donna Brazile.
[01:02:27.142 --> 01:02:27.943]  You remember her.
[01:02:28.403 --> 01:02:31.466]  In her book, she essentially admits that Seth Rich was murdered.
[01:02:31.867 --> 01:02:37.433]  She's now saying, Speaker Pelosi today, President Pelosi tomorrow.
[01:02:37.513 --> 01:02:41.097]  Now, I'm enough of a student of history, and I wrote a book on the
[01:02:41.677 --> 01:02:42.378]  We're good to go.
[01:03:08.579 --> 01:03:20.767]  So Pelosi and 93 others, including her right-hand henchman, the ever-unbelievable and fraudulent conman, Congressman Adam Schiff, were planning to be out of the country.
[01:03:20.787 --> 01:03:21.167]  Exactly.
[01:03:21.207 --> 01:03:22.428]  That's what Trump's got to watch it.
[01:03:23.997 --> 01:03:33.180]  You raised this specter yesterday on the show, and I already see the trolls on Twitter saying, Jones and Stone are crazy when they talk assassination.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.401]  No, let's be realistic.
[01:03:34.721 --> 01:03:38.662]  There have been two attempted assassinations in modern times.
[01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:41.383]  There was an attempt to kill President Gerald Ford.
[01:03:41.764 --> 01:03:42.584]  There was an attempt
[01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:45.525]  To kill President Ronald Reagan.
[01:03:45.925 --> 01:03:50.147]  There were attempts on Trump during the presidential campaign.
[01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:57.470]  I have heard from sources in the Secret Service that there have been thwarted attempts to kill Trump since he's been president.
[01:03:57.610 --> 01:03:59.871]  It is not outside the realm of possibility.
[01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:02.092]  It is not conspiracy theory.
[01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.472]  It is not crazy.
[01:04:03.872 --> 01:04:06.854]  The Deep State is perfectly capable of this.
[01:04:07.374 --> 01:04:10.335]  I pray every night for the President's safety.
[01:04:10.755 --> 01:04:15.098]  He's the only thing mooring this country to sanity at this point.
[01:04:15.979 --> 01:04:18.701]  And, you know, Mike Pence is a nice enough fellow.
[01:04:19.142 --> 01:04:20.623]  I'm sure he was a pretty good governor.
[01:04:21.163 --> 01:04:27.428]  But he is just as committed to the status quo as Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan.
[01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:29.830]  Let's be clear, the only way they can do an impeachment...
[01:04:30.745 --> 01:04:38.470]  Only thing they can do in impeachment to remove them both, so Pelosi's third in line and gets in there, is to use the fake election Russiagate meddling canard.
[01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:39.690]  And that is their plan.
[01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:44.993]  And as you said, last week on the show, they're planning to take Trump out and Ann Pence and put her in.
[01:04:45.033 --> 01:04:49.396]  Now Donna Brazile has crawled out from under her rock to say that, indeed, that's the plan.
[01:04:49.456 --> 01:04:49.876]  Incredible.
[01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:51.617]  Roger Stone, we'll talk to you again very soon.
[01:04:51.637 --> 01:04:52.558]  God bless you and Godspeed.
[01:04:53.305 --> 01:04:53.886]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:05:06.809 --> 01:05:09.510]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.

[01:06:13.277 --> 01:06:19.261]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:42.981 --> 01:06:47.843]  Jan Ervin joins us coming up in the next segment for about an hour and 45 minutes or so.
[01:06:48.583 --> 01:06:51.264]  And he's the guy that first took DMT with Joe Rogan.
[01:06:52.224 --> 01:06:54.065]  He's the guy that got Joe Rogan into podcasting.
[01:06:54.865 --> 01:07:02.228]  And as part of my behind-the-scenes investigation into who Joe Rogan really is, he is one of the important places to start.
[01:07:03.609 --> 01:07:06.890]  Right here in Austin, Texas, though, is the mother load.
[01:07:08.095 --> 01:07:14.278]  And I have been massively censored even more by YouTube and Google since they're talking about their star player, their modern Timothy Leary.
[01:07:14.758 --> 01:07:19.961]  So this is very, very important information to the country and the world, and how they're seducing the young people of the planet.
[01:07:20.441 --> 01:07:24.643]  And that's why I'm going to do this, because Joe's proven he's with the globalists.
[01:07:25.264 --> 01:07:26.885]  He's proven he's with what they're doing.
[01:07:27.285 --> 01:07:28.926]  And he's completely gone over to the dark side.
[01:07:29.286 --> 01:07:30.386]  And so, fine, that's good.
[01:07:30.426 --> 01:07:33.768]  He's chosen his side, and we're going to expose it.
[01:07:33.788 --> 01:07:34.809]  But it's not just about Joe.
[01:07:35.729 --> 01:07:37.891]  That is all coming up.
[01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:42.995]  Now, we exclusively learned this on air last hour.
[01:07:43.055 --> 01:07:44.576]  There's no news covering it yet.
[01:07:45.276 --> 01:08:03.931]  It turns out the supposed Native American victim, with the young evil white people surrounding him and threatening him, turns out he's a political operative and activist that professionally goes around to different campuses starting fights and trying to get anyone dressing as a Native American banned.
[01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:05.772]  So he's an anti-free speech guy.
[01:08:05.792 --> 01:08:06.872]  This has been in the news for years.
[01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:11.814]  And turns out, he came over with a group of people saying they were going to kill and attack the young people.
[01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:12.394]  He didn't do it.
[01:08:12.634 --> 01:08:13.674]  He just led them over there.
[01:08:14.415 --> 01:08:19.016]  And then they turned it around when no violence happened and said that they had attacked the old man.
[01:08:19.477 --> 01:08:22.958]  Now people are calling for the children to be murdered as young as seven.
[01:08:23.378 --> 01:08:26.099]  Prominent Democrats are calling for their homes to be doxed.
[01:08:26.139 --> 01:08:26.959]  They have been doxed.
[01:08:27.039 --> 01:08:27.940]  Kathy Griffin and others.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.682]  And Verified Leftist calls for mega kids to be fired on, school burned down.
[01:08:34.943 --> 01:08:36.484]  They are not removing this off Twitter.
[01:08:36.524 --> 01:08:39.146]  This is authorized calling for their deaths.
[01:08:40.567 --> 01:08:51.176]  So I'm sure Paul Watson or one of the writers is going to get a story out about this very soon, about Nathan Phillips, because on air I pointed out that they were funding women to do this to me a few months ago when I was in D.C.
[01:08:51.796 --> 01:08:54.578]  at my own hearings that I wasn't allowed to be at, but they were about me.
[01:08:55.099 --> 01:09:03.886]  But they had women funded for the Kavanaugh hearings, and they were coming up cussing, yelling, calling me a subhuman white monkey, and then the news edited to say I attacked them.
[01:09:05.585 --> 01:09:07.786]  And it's always now this news doing it.
[01:09:08.646 --> 01:09:10.027]  It's always now this news doing it.
[01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:18.030]  So beware when somebody walks up and goes, hey, subhuman white, your mother's married to your father, you piece of trash, cave-dwelling monkey!
[01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:20.131]  Whites are scum!
[01:09:20.151 --> 01:09:20.911]  Get out of this country!
[01:09:20.931 --> 01:09:22.652]  You're like, man, you're really racist.
[01:09:22.852 --> 01:09:26.573]  And then she then cuts aside and goes, I'm a veteran.
[01:09:27.073 --> 01:09:27.834]  I love America.
[01:09:27.874 --> 01:09:28.594]  Why are you saying this?
[01:09:28.634 --> 01:09:32.555]  I'm like, you just said my mother and my father are brother and sister.
[01:09:32.575 --> 01:09:33.516]  You just called me subhuman.
[01:09:34.471 --> 01:09:35.613]  She's like, no I didn't.
[01:09:35.633 --> 01:09:39.458]  And it's because they were with NowThis setting me up!
[01:09:39.859 --> 01:09:41.401]  I'd been on that street corner for 30 minutes.
[01:09:41.782 --> 01:09:42.362]  They were inside.
[01:09:42.402 --> 01:09:43.143]  They came out.
[01:09:45.401 --> 01:09:47.422]  We have the raw footage on Infowars.com to show the truth.
[01:09:47.462 --> 01:09:48.923]  Again, this is bigger than just these events.
[01:09:49.824 --> 01:09:51.685]  It's about the media thinks you're so dumb.
[01:09:52.266 --> 01:09:58.990]  They march a leftist-funded activist into a group of kids wearing red, white, and blue at a pro-life march.
[01:09:59.551 --> 01:10:04.514]  Most of them weren't even wearing mega hats, but they saw the red hats.
[01:10:04.554 --> 01:10:05.655]  They go over to start a fight.
[01:10:06.778 --> 01:10:14.540]  And then the media edits all of that out and says that they surrounded the poor native and he goes on NPR and says, it's horrible what they did to me.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.761]  They should get in trouble.
[01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:21.423]  Grown men with clubs come over and say, we're going to harvest your organs to seven year old kids.
[01:10:21.623 --> 01:10:22.843]  We're going to kill you.
[01:10:23.463 --> 01:10:26.184]  It's like NPR is like, oh my God, they're so sweet.
[01:10:28.345 --> 01:10:30.806]  The horrible white supremacist attacked everyone.
[01:10:31.666 --> 01:10:32.126]  Meanwhile,
[01:10:33.527 --> 01:10:40.050]  When Jan Erwin leaves us, we are going to get into Israel and Iran are going to war.
[01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:41.611]  That's why Trump's really pulling us out.
[01:10:41.631 --> 01:10:43.672]  Because every time Israel goes to war, the U.S.
[01:10:43.712 --> 01:10:44.612]  pulls out of the Middle East.
[01:10:45.052 --> 01:10:46.093]  That's what's really happening here.
[01:10:46.873 --> 01:10:49.994]  We've also got absolute evil taking place.
[01:10:50.595 --> 01:10:56.817]  Google is going to ban the term family after employees argued that it's homophobic for families to exist.
[01:10:57.478 --> 01:10:57.978]  I'm not kidding.
[01:10:57.998 --> 01:10:58.718]  That's the Daily Caller.
[01:10:58.998 --> 01:10:59.559]  Here's another one.
[01:11:00.905 --> 01:11:07.671]  Britain's first transgender family reveals son five is also transitioning because the parents, in my view, are abusing him.
[01:11:08.752 --> 01:11:13.636]  And so the parents think it's okay, I guess, to chop your genitals off, it's okay or whatever, or force drug you.
[01:11:13.997 --> 01:11:18.681]  So they convince the child you're a girl and then do this and now they're movie stars.
[01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:24.526]  So this, this is pure, absolute, total evil and all part of the depopulation plan.
[01:11:25.086 --> 01:11:26.888]  Now, before we get into all of that,
[01:11:29.002 --> 01:11:30.923]  Let's have some interesting time here.
[01:11:32.004 --> 01:11:38.049]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a globalist, anti-gun, anti-constitution monster, but I don't wish her any harm.
[01:11:38.909 --> 01:11:42.052]  But she's been out for weeks, and the word is she could die any time.
[01:11:42.112 --> 01:11:46.935]  But we have real footage, radio listeners, I'll describe it for you, of her at the hospital.
[01:11:47.215 --> 01:11:48.356]  She's doing just fine.
[01:11:48.396 --> 01:11:49.297]  Let's go and go to that footage.
[01:11:51.118 --> 01:11:54.921]  Barely alive.
[01:11:54.941 --> 01:11:56.242]  General people.
[01:11:58.775 --> 01:12:00.296]  I think that's another guy we're talking about.
[01:12:00.336 --> 01:12:00.616]  No, no, no.
[01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:03.477]  This is the footage of her at the hospital.
[01:12:03.897 --> 01:12:05.118]  Ladies and gentlemen, here it is.
[01:12:06.398 --> 01:12:27.027]  What's up, Schumer?
[01:12:29.224 --> 01:12:31.925]  Pelosi, we're going to visit Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[01:12:39.929 --> 01:12:46.752]  This is exclusive footage inside Top Hospital in D.C.
[01:12:50.994 --> 01:12:51.795]  There she is, folks.
[01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:54.376]  Like I told you, she's totally fine.
[01:13:00.811 --> 01:13:01.712]  This is the top D.C.
[01:13:01.732 --> 01:13:02.052]  elite.
[01:13:04.414 --> 01:13:07.536]  And they're checking on Ruth, making sure she's okay.
[01:13:07.556 --> 01:13:10.418]  She's not dead yet.
[01:13:12.319 --> 01:13:13.120]  My Lord Chamberlain.
[01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:15.762]  There's the scepter.
[01:13:16.943 --> 01:13:17.383]  Kneel!
[01:13:17.963 --> 01:13:18.484]  Bow!
[01:13:21.866 --> 01:13:25.589]  And there you go, trying to get the scepter.
[01:13:26.249 --> 01:13:26.670]  Mine!
[01:13:28.379 --> 01:13:29.040]  Not yet!
[01:13:34.304 --> 01:13:37.267]  So as you can see, she's doing just fine.
[01:13:37.287 --> 01:13:43.792]  I don't know why we got the German or Dutch version of Dark Crystal.
[01:13:43.812 --> 01:13:44.593]  I wanted the one in English.
[01:13:45.494 --> 01:13:46.294]  But you get the idea.
[01:13:46.314 --> 01:13:50.058]  She's doing just fine there.
[01:13:50.098 --> 01:13:50.378]  You see?
[01:13:50.398 --> 01:13:53.561]  It says she's not going to vacate her throne yet.
[01:13:55.482 --> 01:13:56.123]  Everything's fine.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.461]  And, of course, the family is bad.
[01:14:03.942 --> 01:14:04.402]  God is bad.
[01:14:04.782 --> 01:14:05.443]  These people are good.
[01:14:06.883 --> 01:14:07.423]  So there you go.
[01:14:07.463 --> 01:14:09.964]  Ruth is doing really, really well, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:11.985 --> 01:14:16.427]  I mean, she's having a little bit of a problem with her makeup, but other than that...
[01:14:18.010 --> 01:14:22.072]  Okay, well, looks like she'll be on the court for a while, but somebody needs to get a dustpan.
[01:14:22.672 --> 01:14:23.632]  Now, that was fake news.
[01:14:23.672 --> 01:14:26.754]  That was actually from the Dark Crystal and some foreign language of it, but it's okay.
[01:14:27.074 --> 01:14:28.415]  The train wreck's awesome today.
[01:14:29.155 --> 01:14:32.456]  Let's now go to what's really happening to her at the military hospital.
[01:14:32.536 --> 01:14:33.137]  This is real.
[01:14:33.357 --> 01:14:34.037]  This is real news.
[01:14:34.057 --> 01:14:34.737]  She's doing fine.
[01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.099]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[01:14:38.139 --> 01:14:39.039]  Judge.
[01:14:39.099 --> 01:14:40.700]  A woman barely alive.
[01:14:43.869 --> 01:14:46.070]  General People, we can rebuild her.
[01:14:47.051 --> 01:14:48.832]  We have the technology.
[01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:53.035]  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic woman.
[01:14:57.378 --> 01:14:58.859]  Ginsburg will be that woman.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.721]  Better than she was before.
[01:15:04.662 --> 01:15:04.962]  Better.
[01:15:06.003 --> 01:15:06.624]  Stronger.
[01:15:08.024 --> 01:15:08.425]  Faster.
[01:15:14.412 --> 01:15:20.455]  She's incredible, folks, and that's real news.
[01:15:21.596 --> 01:15:24.637]  And that Native American man got surrounded by white supremacists and attacked him.
[01:15:24.657 --> 01:15:25.218]  He's a victim.
[01:15:25.698 --> 01:15:27.219]  The $6 billion woman.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:29.940]  That was awesome.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.481]  All right, let's get serious.
[01:15:32.001 --> 01:15:35.843]  When we come back, inside the DMT-CIA movement.
[01:15:37.764 --> 01:15:38.325]  Inside.
[01:15:39.329 --> 01:15:49.015]  Rolling out hardcore mind control drugs on the population in part two of what the CIA did in the 60s with the CIA revolution, which is all admitted.
[01:15:49.775 --> 01:15:57.900]  And inside, Google's man, their emissary to the children, Joe Rogan, the mercenary.
[01:15:58.460 --> 01:15:59.141]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:59.161 --> 01:15:59.641]  Stay with us.
[01:16:05.359 --> 01:16:08.020]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:14.282]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:16:14.802 --> 01:16:26.826]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[01:16:30.288 --> 01:16:34.029]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[01:16:35.836 --> 01:16:38.617]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply.
[01:16:39.018 --> 01:16:41.939]  This is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.521]  Perfect for work in the car or at home.
[01:16:47.062 --> 01:16:49.843]  Turbo Force is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[01:16:50.303 --> 01:16:51.684]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[01:17:05.302 --> 01:17:13.164]  You've got Alexandra Cortez coming out saying CBS is racist and bad because they didn't send a black reporter to cover her for Congress.
[01:17:13.344 --> 01:17:15.365]  But she says, better get better next time.
[01:17:15.425 --> 01:17:19.366]  That's why to counter her and to get back in her face whenever she said that Don Jr.
[01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:23.267]  might face prison time for making the point that, you know, she loves Venezuela so much.
[01:17:23.367 --> 01:17:24.767]  In Venezuela, they eat their dogs.
[01:17:24.907 --> 01:17:27.508]  In capitalist countries like America, we walk our dogs.
[01:17:27.788 --> 01:17:32.872]  So, I came up with the idea for this little baby, and we have this as a limited edition, but I want it to be a bestseller.
[01:17:32.993 --> 01:17:34.194]  This is the first limited edition.
[01:17:34.214 --> 01:17:35.355]  We have another design coming out.
[01:17:35.635 --> 01:17:38.497]  There's only a few thousand of these, but we want this to be a huge seller.
[01:17:38.778 --> 01:17:42.661]  We want to put 50,000, 100,000 out of these like we've done Hillary for President.
[01:17:43.301 --> 01:17:47.125]  And it says, Capitalists walk their dogs, Socialists eat them.
[01:17:47.905 --> 01:17:52.269]  Then it's got an American flag that's very triggering to her, saying InfoWars.com.
[01:17:52.890 --> 01:17:53.630]  So, there it is.
[01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:57.033]  It is on Infowars.com.
[01:17:57.653 --> 01:18:00.275]  There's links to it on Infowars.com.
[01:18:00.836 --> 01:18:01.776]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:18:01.857 --> 01:18:04.218]  Capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[01:18:04.398 --> 01:18:15.226]  Sure, this is triggering, this is powerful, and it shows her with an enlarged cartoon head with giant ears looking like a dog foaming at the mouth because that's what she looks like is a dog on methamphetamine.
[01:18:15.367 --> 01:18:16.848]  She's probably on methamphetamine.
[01:18:16.868 --> 01:18:17.648]  I mean, what is she on?
[01:18:17.668 --> 01:18:18.389]  We should ask the question.
[01:18:18.489 --> 01:18:19.270]  She used to be good-looking.
[01:18:19.290 --> 01:18:21.191]  She's lost so much weight and has meth mouth.
[01:18:21.351 --> 01:18:23.812]  So you could call it the Alexandra Cortez meth mouth.
[01:18:23.993 --> 01:18:31.457]  Because she dares to threaten people with jail time and subpoenas if they make fun of the fact that capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[01:18:31.577 --> 01:18:34.679]  And she looks meth, you know, out of her brain now.
[01:18:34.719 --> 01:18:37.040]  Like she's flying on planet Pop-Tart.
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:39.382]  And so, get the hottest shirt on the internet.
[01:18:39.422 --> 01:18:40.202]  We know it's gonna be the hottest.
[01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:43.104]  No reviews yet because we're just launching it in the last few days.
[01:18:43.264 --> 01:18:46.166]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:18:48.407 --> 01:18:49.367]  Listen, we need your support.
[01:18:49.387 --> 01:18:51.288]  We want these to blow off the shelf.
[01:18:51.428 --> 01:18:52.389]  I want to reorder them.
[01:18:52.489 --> 01:18:54.790]  We're going to have a slightly different design each time.
[01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:59.572]  I want to have 10 different limited editions shell out in the next six months of this.
[01:18:59.672 --> 01:19:03.673]  And I want this everywhere, because she's the new symbol of the Democratic Party.
[01:19:04.253 --> 01:19:07.695]  And it points out, capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[01:19:08.035 --> 01:19:11.036]  And when people say, man, well, why are you showing her as a dog?
[01:19:11.276 --> 01:19:12.977]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, in the final
[01:19:13.277 --> 01:19:14.378]  Equation of communism.
[01:19:14.478 --> 01:19:16.759]  People eat people and are made lower than dogs.
[01:19:16.899 --> 01:19:21.160]  And she is a absolute tyrant wanting to arrest people that make fun of her.
[01:19:21.301 --> 01:19:25.042]  And so we're gonna show her how America works and throw it back in her face.
[01:19:25.122 --> 01:19:28.584]  Because she, her dancing a few years ago, she was good-looking and looked healthy.
[01:19:29.124 --> 01:19:30.204]  What drugs are she on?
[01:19:30.224 --> 01:19:31.225]  We need an intervention.
[01:19:31.585 --> 01:19:32.686]  What, methamphetamine?
[01:19:32.706 --> 01:19:34.606]  Or is it, is it Adderall?
[01:19:34.867 --> 01:19:35.807]  What is she snorting?
[01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:37.928]  We need to help Alexandria Cortez.
[01:19:38.108 --> 01:19:38.768]  Get the t-shirt.
[01:19:38.968 --> 01:19:39.889]  InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:19:40.009 --> 01:19:40.269]  Do it!
[01:20:06.418 --> 01:20:09.021]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:41.542 --> 01:20:43.984]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:20:44.004 --> 01:20:46.867]  We're about an hour and 20 minutes into this global broadcast.
[01:20:47.307 --> 01:20:49.149]  Mike Adams is going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[01:20:49.169 --> 01:20:51.391]  I want to be very clear about this.
[01:20:52.953 --> 01:20:58.838]  I am not coming out against DMT and coming out against Joe Rogan.
[01:20:59.898 --> 01:21:02.179]  Because Joe Rogan didn't have me back on his podcast.
[01:21:02.939 --> 01:21:08.240]  Joe had never had me on his podcast, even though he'd been doing it for like 10 years before he had me on two years ago.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:18.202]  And then I simply asked Joe, because everybody kept asking for me to be on what was the most popular podcast he ever did, why he wasn't having me on.
[01:21:18.222 --> 01:21:20.003]  And I just simply said a few months ago,
[01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:35.605]  Please stop reading the talking points that George Soros was a victim of the Nazis, and that I'm lying about him being a Nazi collaborator when he said it on 60 Minutes, and please stop saying I've sent people to Sandy Hook family's houses and that I'm currently doing it, and basically defending my deplatforming.
[01:21:37.366 --> 01:21:45.109]  I said because I know you're going off talking points, which Howard Sterns followed as well, the king of free speech, who by the way is airing impersonators of me
[01:21:46.323 --> 01:21:50.046]  Saying, this is Alex Jones, you need to go harass the Sandy Hook families.
[01:21:50.526 --> 01:21:52.027]  So they can then say, I'm doing that.
[01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:53.248]  When I never said that.
[01:21:55.350 --> 01:22:00.313]  And so then I remembered the last few years, things I learned here in Austin, things that happened years ago.
[01:22:01.374 --> 01:22:04.917]  Like 10 years ago in Austin, 8 years ago in Austin, 5 years ago in Austin.
[01:22:06.438 --> 01:22:09.120]  That whenever Joe would come to town a couple times a year, he'd give me a call.
[01:22:10.249 --> 01:22:17.496]  He usually gave me a call, or sometimes I'd learn about it and call him, and we'd go out to eat a couple times, or I'd go see his shows, and stuff like that.
[01:22:17.696 --> 01:22:18.798]  Joe's a funny, smart guy.
[01:22:19.919 --> 01:22:21.841]  And I got to know people he ran around with.
[01:22:22.761 --> 01:22:28.027]  Comedians, and business people, and gurus, and things like that.
[01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:34.313]  And it was the stuff I learned in the last few years here in Austin.
[01:22:35.427 --> 01:22:42.794]  From people close to Joe and businesses he's involved in that I know you can't do unless you're mobbed up with the FBI and the CIA.
[01:22:44.196 --> 01:22:49.161]  I mean, only Timothy Leary could go around with suitcases of hallucinogens and hand them out and get on airplanes with them.
[01:22:50.182 --> 01:22:52.024]  Directly from the CIA, and he later admitted that.
[01:22:53.345 --> 01:22:58.210]  So, I started getting, you know, intel on this from law enforcement.
[01:22:59.466 --> 01:23:00.287]  I don't know.
[01:23:19.859 --> 01:23:21.780]  Known something was going on and then not done anything.
[01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:25.983]  But when you already are friends with somebody and you're a very loyal person, it's my weakness and my strength.
[01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.244]  I'm like a dog, very loyal.
[01:23:27.764 --> 01:23:34.788]  You kind of slowly blind yourself to things that you've seen until they're right there in front of you.
[01:23:35.889 --> 01:23:36.229]  Okay?
[01:23:37.170 --> 01:23:38.711]  So, let's just say this.
[01:23:38.891 --> 01:23:41.292]  Modern MKUltra is going on all around the world.
[01:23:41.572 --> 01:23:44.094]  And it's not just gurus promoting it on television.
[01:23:45.086 --> 01:23:46.627]  Or on popular podcasts all over.
[01:23:47.487 --> 01:23:59.635]  It's being promoted at the local grassroots level with self-help groups being shut up that are 100% beyond anything you'd think of the Scientologists.
[01:23:59.655 --> 01:24:03.517]  Because the Scientologists aren't putting people on Ayahuasca and DMT.
[01:24:05.498 --> 01:24:05.739]  Okay?
[01:24:05.759 --> 01:24:07.339]  And they don't have medical doctors on staff.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:09.321]  So, I'm here to tell you.
[01:24:10.276 --> 01:24:19.991]  Just in the last year, I then learned more about UT's involvement testing new, super high-end, super strong hallucinogens that they're testing on Austinites.
[01:24:21.253 --> 01:24:22.875]  This is classified information, by the way.
[01:24:23.732 --> 01:24:27.774]  And then I remember someone connected to Joe like 18, 19 years ago.
[01:24:27.794 --> 01:24:29.535]  Hell, it was before 9-11, 20 years ago.
[01:24:30.296 --> 01:24:40.481]  Inviting me to the UT research facility when they thought I was a joke and telling me all this wild stuff and I'm like, well this is like MKUltra and they go, no, this is way past that.
[01:24:42.643 --> 01:24:48.186]  And so it's not just Joe, it's the whole, it's a whole culture taking over.
[01:24:48.766 --> 01:24:49.687]  Joe's just part of it.
[01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:54.861]  But he's a kingpin in it, and so he needs to be exposed.
[01:24:54.921 --> 01:25:01.882]  So I appreciate our guest holding Jan Ervin, and of course he's TLogosMedia.com.
[01:25:02.002 --> 01:25:03.062]  Jan Ervin.
[01:25:03.282 --> 01:25:04.283]  I'm fully aware of his work.
[01:25:04.343 --> 01:25:06.163]  At a time he had one of the biggest podcasts on the internet.
[01:25:06.463 --> 01:25:08.243]  He introduced Joe to podcasting.
[01:25:10.084 --> 01:25:12.484]  He was the first person to take DMT with Joe.
[01:25:12.504 --> 01:25:16.625]  And I think the best way to quantify this, and then I'll go to him and shut up, is that
[01:25:17.679 --> 01:25:18.942]  He doesn't want to attack Joe either.
[01:25:19.042 --> 01:25:22.148]  He just wants to be truthful and get off the planet with his soul.
[01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:23.291]  And he's worried about it.
[01:25:23.311 --> 01:25:24.333]  He's got kids like I do.
[01:25:24.393 --> 01:25:25.976]  And Joe's just a big window into this world.
[01:25:27.082 --> 01:25:38.431]  And his progression of selling out the system, and even supporting anti-free speech stuff, and putting out the talking points is... Yon got into this, and was being used by people he now knows are connected to the system big time.
[01:25:39.132 --> 01:25:49.320]  He was popular, and as soon as he figured out it was bad, that's when everybody pulled back, and it went from Yon, as seen nodding his head, being the man, the new Timothy Leary, because he didn't want to be it,
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:50.921]  It became Joe.
[01:25:51.321 --> 01:25:53.262]  And so it isn't like, oh, I'm jealous.
[01:25:53.802 --> 01:25:55.564]  You know, I'm not the big guy pushing DMT.
[01:25:55.604 --> 01:25:59.986]  He's the guy that brought this to everybody, but he had people behind him and he understood it.
[01:26:00.046 --> 01:26:07.051]  And again, when you understand what this really is, opening up another portal, another dimension, it's very, very dangerous.
[01:26:07.331 --> 01:26:08.412]  So we got three minutes to break.
[01:26:08.692 --> 01:26:09.412]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:26:09.432 --> 01:26:11.093]  I see you nodding your head.
[01:26:11.133 --> 01:26:15.076]  Give us your opening statement on what you want people to know, and we'll come back and get into great detail on all this.
[01:26:15.885 --> 01:26:19.106]  Well, you know, I was an ethnobotanist for years.
[01:26:19.226 --> 01:26:25.349]  I was considered one of the leading researchers in psychedelics back in the 2000s.
[01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:31.011]  In 2007-2008, I was working on a book called The Holy Mushroom.
[01:26:31.091 --> 01:26:36.473]  I discovered that the guy I was investigating, he was the so-called discoverer of magic mushrooms.
[01:26:36.813 --> 01:26:42.956]  I discovered that he was working with the CIA, MKUltra Subproject 58, a guy by the name of Gordon Wasson.
[01:26:44.257 --> 01:26:55.857]  In 2003-2004 I had met Joe Rogan and we had become friends for about eight years up until the day I was on his show in the summer of 2011.
[01:26:57.917 --> 01:27:13.555]  And basically he interrupted my whole interview on his show is episode 119 on the JRE podcast to interrupt for you know genital jokes and stuff like this and basically slander me during the interview.
[01:27:13.695 --> 01:27:18.981]  I had about a thousand emails from his audience apologizing to me over the next year
[01:27:19.747 --> 01:27:20.709]  For his behavior.
[01:27:21.209 --> 01:27:29.061]  In 2012, I published an article, Gordon Wasson, the man, the legend, the myth exposing the fraud behind magic mushrooms.
[01:27:29.121 --> 01:27:32.527]  And really, it began a whole investigation behind.
[01:27:33.371 --> 01:27:38.796]  The CIA's true MKUltra program as the psychedelic counterculture.
[01:27:39.356 --> 01:27:48.664]  And when I did that, I went from being one of the top guys out there and podcasting and everything, and they immediately shoved my show down, tried to push me out.
[01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:54.789]  Joe Rogan and others were out there, like Simon Powell.
[01:27:55.755 --> 01:28:03.297]  Iona Miller, others, putting out hit pieces against me, spinning all of my research and everything, and totally lying about what I said.
[01:28:03.337 --> 01:28:06.037]  They got Dennis McKenna in on it.
[01:28:06.097 --> 01:28:10.178]  Dennis McKenna did a hit piece on me at Freer Mind Conference several years ago.
[01:28:10.678 --> 01:28:13.699]  But Dennis McKenna is, of course, Terrence McKenna's brother.
[01:28:14.259 --> 01:28:19.440]  And I ended up exposing all of these guys as working for this agenda.
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:23.521]  I didn't get the memo that I wasn't supposed to publish the truth on this stuff.
[01:28:23.601 --> 01:28:23.921]  I thought,
[01:28:24.561 --> 01:28:48.263]  As a researcher, we were supposed to publish what we found, and I got into the citations, into the primary citations, and started checking all of the people's research that I was working with, and checking their facts and everything, and most of these people, their research did not pan out, and I started exposing all of this, and so they came out attacking me,
[01:28:49.083 --> 01:28:51.745]  And have done so now for well since 2011, 2012.
[01:28:51.805 --> 01:28:52.245]  Stay there!
[01:28:52.265 --> 01:28:53.706]  We're going to come right back.
[01:28:53.746 --> 01:28:55.887]  We're going to come right back.
[01:28:55.927 --> 01:28:57.929]  We're going to get into all this and then go big picture.
[01:28:58.409 --> 01:28:59.510]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:59.590 --> 01:29:00.490]  Infowars.com.
[01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:01.291]  Newswars.com.
[01:29:02.712 --> 01:29:17.341]  I recently saw a Gillette
[01:29:20.407 --> 01:29:25.950]  Let's spend a minute and a half showing men as the enemy.
[01:29:26.571 --> 01:29:29.232]  That if a man tries to talk to a beautiful woman, he's a bad guy.
[01:29:29.312 --> 01:29:33.955]  Or if two kids get in a fight, somehow just men fighting, period, is evil.
[01:29:35.987 --> 01:29:49.033]  When you look at the Romans conquering civilizations where they would kill all the men, or you look at black slaves with the women being kept as the house service to suppress the men, you know that any authoritarian society seeking to dominate wants to suppress the men.
[01:29:50.354 --> 01:29:53.435]  Then you read the white papers, the Globalist, that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:29:55.176 --> 01:30:05.141]  So men have now learned that this has happened, and there are chemicals added to the water, added to the food, trying to suppress their normal drive, their normal ethos, who they are.
[01:30:06.496 --> 01:30:12.401]  And that's why, online, herbs and supplements known to boost libido, stamina, and energy are such best sellers.
[01:30:12.421 --> 01:30:14.522]  That's why I'm getting into that market.
[01:30:15.763 --> 01:30:24.310]  Six, seven years ago, as a producer, I went out and found the most powerful formulas out there to not just give men, but also women, a boost.
[01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:27.212]  Super male, super female vitality.
[01:30:27.613 --> 01:30:32.777]  No one else produces a herbal formula that's cold-pressed and then aged.
[01:30:33.866 --> 01:30:36.608]  Like this group does in Utah.
[01:30:37.568 --> 01:30:42.691]  And they've had so much trouble getting the wild sourced herbs that I'm having to discontinue it.
[01:30:43.711 --> 01:30:46.473]  Now, they've said maybe in a year, maybe in two, they can bring it back.
[01:30:46.533 --> 01:30:50.835]  But right now, this is the last run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:30:50.875 --> 01:30:51.356]  It's 50% off.
[01:30:51.436 --> 01:30:57.059]  Even though it's selling out, I want you to experience what God gave us through nature.
[01:30:57.119 --> 01:31:00.401]  But regardless, if you're depressed, go out and go for a hike.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:04.782]  If you feel like you're a loser, you know, go out and help people at a soup kitchen.
[01:31:05.602 --> 01:31:08.804]  Because all the studies show, giving is better than receiving.
[01:31:09.644 --> 01:31:11.906]  You've given to us in incredible ways at InfoWars.
[01:31:11.926 --> 01:31:17.408]  You've supported us, you've been demonized for us, you've bought our products, and you've been fulfilled by it.
[01:31:17.449 --> 01:31:18.329]  You've seen great results.
[01:31:18.609 --> 01:31:19.550]  And I thank you for that.
[01:31:20.650 --> 01:31:24.552]  But when I bring on a product, I want to make sure it's the very best I can for you at the very best price.
[01:31:24.832 --> 01:31:29.235]  Because I appreciate what you're doing, and I believe in the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[01:31:30.225 --> 01:31:30.866]  So I salute you.
[01:31:30.886 --> 01:31:31.387]  I thank you.
[01:31:31.407 --> 01:31:35.712]  I just want to encourage you to get the last run in the foreseeable future.
[01:31:35.932 --> 01:31:39.737]  Hopefully, it comes back of super male vitality and super female vitality.
[01:31:40.358 --> 01:31:40.918]  You know, it's funny.
[01:31:40.938 --> 01:31:42.440]  The price went up and up and up for it.
[01:31:43.321 --> 01:31:47.006]  It is a great formula and a bestseller with 4,000 plus five-star reviews.
[01:31:48.087 --> 01:31:54.188]  Well, for the last year, I couldn't get resupplied, and I said, I'm not going to buy it for the last six months, and now we're in discussions.
[01:31:54.228 --> 01:32:03.410]  Maybe the herbs can be gotten, and it is hard, but the point is, is that I'm giving you such a low price that what I'm selling it to you for becomes cost prohibitive to bring you something like this.
[01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:09.032]  We brought out powdered versions that are even stronger, but are powdered and organic, but not cold-pressed.
[01:32:09.412 --> 01:32:10.572]  People like them, but not as much.
[01:32:11.112 --> 01:32:14.013]  Because there's something about super male and super female vitality.
[01:32:14.033 --> 01:32:19.294]  So get the last available bottles at EnforcedStore.com or call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:32:19.334 --> 01:32:21.955]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're proud of these products.
[01:32:22.455 --> 01:32:23.376]  We're proud of what we've done.
[01:32:23.396 --> 01:32:25.316]  I know I'm under scrutiny.

[01:32:39.884 --> 01:32:47.053]  So, be part of history, get a t-shirt, get a book, get some of the supplements, and know you're funding the second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[01:32:47.734 --> 01:32:52.299]  Super male and super female vitality, 50% off for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:52.439 --> 01:32:52.840]  Thank you all.
[01:33:06.338 --> 01:33:10.461]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:14.763 --> 01:33:20.346]  I asked Bobby Dylan.
[01:33:21.187 --> 01:33:22.868]  I asked the Beatles.
[01:33:22.988 --> 01:33:25.389]  I asked Timothy Leary.
[01:33:25.409 --> 01:33:28.351]  But he couldn't help me either.
[01:33:28.411 --> 01:33:29.772]  They called me the seeker.
[01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:49.162]  John Irvin is our exclusive guest here.
[01:33:49.182 --> 01:33:52.803]  The guy that first gave DMT to Joe Rogan.
[01:33:54.224 --> 01:33:56.785]  And the lovable and good guy Eddie Bravo.
[01:33:57.145 --> 01:34:00.026]  Can tell you exclusively, first time ever, gonna hear it here.
[01:34:00.046 --> 01:34:02.147]  You need to understand something.
[01:34:03.419 --> 01:34:11.146]  The original system that set up the Aztecs, the Mayans, the Babylonians, the Egyptians was hallucinogens.
[01:34:11.967 --> 01:34:20.935]  And there's no new drug under the sun that isn't a permutation or a synthetic of compounds already existing.
[01:34:21.716 --> 01:34:27.001]  So when you hear that DMT was discovered 70 years ago or whatever, you hear LSD was discovered by a guy in Switzerland,
[01:34:30.438 --> 01:34:38.944]  The most ancient thing is for cults, the witch doctors, who know how to make medicine and other things and who keep track of the stars so they know when the eclipse is coming.
[01:34:39.844 --> 01:34:40.565]  They have the memory.
[01:34:41.185 --> 01:34:42.246]  They have the written word.
[01:34:42.346 --> 01:34:43.366]  They have the Sanskrit.
[01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:44.727]  They have the cuneiform.
[01:34:45.788 --> 01:34:46.749]  They have the hieroglyphics.
[01:34:48.590 --> 01:34:49.931]  The general public doesn't have knowledge.
[01:34:50.491 --> 01:34:58.937]  So what you saw in ancient times is just now happening again on a bigger scale with the establishment having the knowledge, having the secrets, being able to track what you do and what you hear and what you watch.
[01:35:00.214 --> 01:35:09.837]  And the final piece was that certain members of the tribe, who would be given access to part of the priesthood, would be given drugs.
[01:35:10.577 --> 01:35:19.640]  And if you read Ezekiel, or if you read Revelation, the angels come and they say, take this.
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:25.402]  And they eat it, and it's sweet in the mouth, bitter in the stomach, and then they see the other dimensions.
[01:35:26.769 --> 01:35:27.729]  Now, that's what's in the Bible.
[01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:32.071]  Your backward preacher doesn't know that because they weren't there thousands of years ago.
[01:35:32.532 --> 01:35:33.212]  But that's what it is.
[01:35:33.272 --> 01:35:38.574]  So, oh, Timothy Leary, here's LSD, I'm the first to do this.
[01:35:38.814 --> 01:35:40.475]  Oh, Joe Rogan, here's DMT.
[01:35:40.515 --> 01:35:41.816]  Hey, yeah, everybody, it's cool.
[01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:46.678]  We're gonna play Timothy Leary admitting it was the CIA, all of it.
[01:35:46.858 --> 01:35:49.019]  The publishers of Time Life books are some of the richest people in the country.
[01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:55.062]  Back in the 20s and 30s, they ran government operations before the OSS even existed.
[01:35:58.106 --> 01:36:05.029]  Where they engage in what you'd call witchcraft, but it wasn't witchcraft like a lady with a black hat and a broom.
[01:36:06.329 --> 01:36:15.413]  That's what women would do when they would take hallucinogens and then put the broom between their legs as a form of sex magic running around a fire masturbating.
[01:36:16.133 --> 01:36:18.374]  So that's what all of this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:19.640]  Period.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.421]  And I'm an expert because I've studied history.
[01:36:21.441 --> 01:36:22.922]  If you study history, it's all right there.
[01:36:22.962 --> 01:36:24.942]  So there it is, hiding in plain view.
[01:36:25.583 --> 01:36:27.023]  Somebody like Joe doesn't think we know this.
[01:36:27.043 --> 01:36:30.025]  And I'm just thinking, well, maybe he's just a low-level idiot following it.
[01:36:30.045 --> 01:36:35.447]  And then I figure out, no, he's actually in pole position to be the new Timothy Leary and beyond.
[01:36:36.327 --> 01:36:38.148]  And so you sit back and you watch this.
[01:36:38.889 --> 01:36:40.990]  And no, I don't want to take DMT, Joe.
[01:36:41.610 --> 01:36:43.531]  And no, I don't want to take ayahuasca with your buddies.
[01:36:44.151 --> 01:36:48.413]  Because I don't want to be around people like that, Hollywood folks, who obviously
[01:36:49.733 --> 01:36:50.814]  Don't take it when you take it.
[01:36:51.695 --> 01:36:53.476]  And I've never taken it because I don't need to take it.
[01:36:53.496 --> 01:36:58.921]  And I'm not going to get into my own private issues, but I go to 62% oxygen, I always have.
[01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:03.045]  My head and neck's basically deformed after a major surgery and I almost die every night.
[01:37:03.585 --> 01:37:05.307]  Most people die at 62% oxygen.
[01:37:05.667 --> 01:37:10.511]  I have near-death experiences every night, and that's why I have DMT every damn night, folks.
[01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:12.072]  I don't need to take DMT with Joe Rogan.
[01:37:12.193 --> 01:37:13.334]  Fine, I just told you my private issues.
[01:37:13.914 --> 01:37:15.015]  I've been to two different sleep studies.
[01:37:15.035 --> 01:37:16.256]  I'm going to do major surgery on me.
[01:37:16.636 --> 01:37:17.596]  I got a 20-inch neck.
[01:37:17.717 --> 01:37:18.317]  I got problems.
[01:37:18.657 --> 01:37:21.999]  I got to sleep basically sitting up with a mouth guard in my face.
[01:37:22.039 --> 01:37:23.320]  The CPAP machines don't work.
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:24.561]  I said I'd get Yawn on.
[01:37:24.601 --> 01:37:24.881]  I apologize.
[01:37:24.901 --> 01:37:25.482]  I'm going to go to him now.
[01:37:25.742 --> 01:37:30.445]  Problem is, I'm trying to explain to you the whole story here so you understand this isn't just us up here bitching about Joe Rogan.
[01:37:30.745 --> 01:37:37.029]  Our kids and everybody are being targeted with this crap where in ancient times they would give people drugs to then invoke them into mind control.
[01:37:37.349 --> 01:37:38.610]  Mind control didn't just show up.
[01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:42.233]  The CIA and others are just codifying it into a set system of control.
[01:37:42.913 --> 01:37:48.256]  So that when you take this stuff, you're not with your family, or you're not with real good people, you're with controllers.
[01:37:48.296 --> 01:37:51.038]  And they can then direct you into what they want, and now you're their slave.
[01:37:51.718 --> 01:37:52.379]  I'm going to stop now.
[01:37:52.419 --> 01:37:55.400]  Jan, the rest of the hour I'm not going to talk here, other than introducing you.
[01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:56.141]  I'm doing a plug.
[01:37:56.181 --> 01:37:59.222]  But, I mean, your journey, let's start here.
[01:37:59.242 --> 01:38:06.847]  Your journey, who you are, how you met Joe, the whole DMT story, and then we'll get into the, as you woke up to him, and then the big picture of what's currently happening.
[01:38:06.887 --> 01:38:08.768]  Because I've talked to you a lot about what's currently happening.
[01:38:09.432 --> 01:38:21.580]  Like I said at the start of the show here, you know, I met Joe in February 2003 at a friend's house, Jack Hare's house, ironically, who is the head of the California Hemp Initiative, etc.
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:30.345]  And back then I believed in all of this stuff and it was Jack that got me into a lot of this type of research on psychedelics and whatnot.
[01:38:30.385 --> 01:38:31.085]  But in 2003 or 2004 I gave
[01:38:34.099 --> 01:38:38.902]  Joe Rogan and Eddie Bravo, for that matter, their first dose of DMT.
[01:38:39.282 --> 01:38:40.502]  I since regret all of that.
[01:38:40.542 --> 01:38:41.463]  I'm a Christian now.
[01:38:41.543 --> 01:38:45.325]  I submit I don't follow any of my early research.
[01:38:45.345 --> 01:39:00.453]  The only reason why I keep the books out there, especially my second book, is because that's where I began to see the origins of this tying to the intelligence community with Gordon Wasson working with the CIA, Alan Dulles.
[01:39:00.513 --> 01:39:02.394]  I exposed all of that in my articles.
[01:39:03.034 --> 01:39:06.638]  You just showed one of my articles on screen, Spies in Academic Clothing.
[01:39:06.998 --> 01:39:15.867]  That's a very extensive article that breaks down and exposes the entire foundations of the psychedelic community as the CIA's MKUltra program.
[01:39:16.367 --> 01:39:20.872]  I've got Tim Leary admitting that he was CIA, for instance, one of the quotes from that article.
[01:39:21.372 --> 01:39:31.015]  I proceeded as an intelligence agent since 1962, understanding that the next war for control of this planet and beyond had to do with control of consciousness.
[01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:35.157]  Yes, he answered strongly, I was a witting agent of the CIA.
[01:39:35.537 --> 01:39:45.400]  Now a lot of people will argue, one of the most common arguments that I hear against my work is that because these plants and mushrooms and things are older than the CIA, they couldn't possibly be used
[01:39:46.331 --> 01:39:46.911]  We're good to go.
[01:40:07.658 --> 01:40:08.879]  All of this has been covered up.
[01:40:09.119 --> 01:40:23.475]  I renamed Psychedelic Suggestogens back in 2014 after I published an article in Theogens What's in a Name where I go through and I expose how they created the marketing programs by renaming them.
[01:40:23.915 --> 01:40:25.036]  So the kids would take them.
[01:40:25.076 --> 01:40:29.461]  They wouldn't take Suggestogens or Hallucinogens or Psychotomimetics.
[01:40:29.501 --> 01:40:39.450]  So Aldous Huxley, who is the head of the CIA's MKUltra program, or the chief engineer of it, he created, with Humphrey Osmond, created terms like psychedelic, etc.
[01:40:40.211 --> 01:40:47.813]  Humphrey Osmond created the term psychotomimetics, but they would create the term, the words, to market them and then rename them.
[01:40:47.873 --> 01:40:56.516]  Gordon Wasson, along with Professor Karl Ruck at Boston University, whom I personally think should be investigated for academic fraud.
[01:40:57.076 --> 01:41:00.857]  He's one of the key people behind this stuff still today, promoting this stuff out there.
[01:41:02.117 --> 01:41:08.559]  They created the name Entheogen, which means to generate God within, and so these people involved with the CIA
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:09.560]  Yeah.
[01:41:26.563 --> 01:41:32.950]  One academic from the entire field, and this is going back eight years, deal with my research honestly.
[01:41:33.010 --> 01:41:37.375]  They've ridiculed me, name-called at me, tried to get me back in line, etc.
[01:41:37.796 --> 01:41:40.579]  But they will not deal with the citations.
[01:41:40.659 --> 01:41:48.147]  I went to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, Columbia University, Dartmouth, etc., and I polled and had these documents polled.
[01:41:48.647 --> 01:42:02.055]  I put together all of this research based on primary citations showing that the entire 60s counterculture, the rock music, the sex drugs, all of that was part of Aldous Huxley's MKUltra program.
[01:42:02.095 --> 01:42:04.757]  It's based off of his book, The Brave New World.
[01:42:05.157 --> 01:42:09.600]  They want to model society after Huxley's book.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:10.981]  Now Huxley's book wasn't
[01:42:11.644 --> 01:42:19.691]  For telling the future, Huxley's book was the blueprint that they were using, Alex, to do all of this stuff, you know.
[01:42:19.831 --> 01:42:34.042]  And what a lot of people don't understand is that it was actually Tim Leary who went before Congress in the 1960s and asked Congress to outlaw the drugs because the kids wouldn't do them if they were legal.
[01:42:34.122 --> 01:42:39.166]  So they wanted to make it look like Leary's spiritual message was being suppressed.
[01:42:39.187 --> 01:42:39.507]  Right there.
[01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:42.148]  Stay right there.
[01:42:42.509 --> 01:42:52.754]  And again, Julian Huxley was part of a secret British government genetic engineering program I'll tell you about briefly, and his brother headed up the UN Global Program for UNESCO, and he's absolutely right.
[01:42:52.774 --> 01:42:55.696]  And then he wrote a book admitting it all, Brave New World Revisited.
[01:42:56.076 --> 01:42:56.556]  Stay with us.
[01:42:56.857 --> 01:42:57.857]  Infowars.com.
[01:42:57.917 --> 01:42:58.918]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:43:07.608 --> 01:43:19.586]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[01:43:20.774 --> 01:43:39.258]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[01:43:40.898 --> 01:43:42.938]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[01:43:43.319 --> 01:43:44.179]  Whole Foods was number two.
[01:43:45.039 --> 01:43:50.340]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[01:43:51.926 --> 01:43:58.191]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[01:43:59.492 --> 01:44:13.181]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at Infowarslife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[01:44:14.082 --> 01:44:16.144]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[01:44:17.063 --> 01:44:19.949]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[01:44:20.129 --> 01:44:20.750]  No response.
[01:44:20.971 --> 01:44:21.933]  They never want to get my comment.
[01:44:22.474 --> 01:44:23.396]  Now, why am I saying that?
[01:44:24.678 --> 01:44:25.059]  It's simple.
[01:44:26.087 --> 01:44:30.651]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[01:44:31.031 --> 01:44:37.196]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best, show.
[01:44:37.357 --> 01:44:38.217]  We have a great product.
[01:44:38.337 --> 01:44:38.738]  You love it.
[01:44:38.818 --> 01:44:39.438]  You reorder it.
[01:44:39.819 --> 01:44:42.080]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[01:44:42.541 --> 01:44:44.462]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[01:44:44.623 --> 01:44:45.664]  It's a 360 win.
[01:44:46.024 --> 01:44:46.684]  We defeat them.
[01:44:46.784 --> 01:44:47.165]  You win.
[01:44:47.285 --> 01:44:47.625]  I win.
[01:44:47.925 --> 01:44:48.426]  It's amazing.
[01:44:50.279 --> 01:44:55.020]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:45:10.684]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[01:45:12.636 --> 01:45:13.136]  It's hard to believe.
[01:45:13.236 --> 01:45:15.957]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[01:45:16.037 --> 01:45:23.538]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[01:45:24.378 --> 01:45:26.619]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[01:45:26.639 --> 01:45:36.161]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[01:45:36.241 --> 01:45:36.941]  But just know this.
[01:45:38.976 --> 01:45:47.101]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[01:45:47.421 --> 01:45:49.642]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[01:45:50.362 --> 01:46:00.708]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[01:46:01.528 --> 01:46:02.609]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:03.390]  I'm garbage.
[01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:06.031]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[01:46:06.231 --> 01:46:07.532]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[01:46:08.723 --> 01:46:10.066]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[01:46:10.708 --> 01:46:11.810]  Tumeric's dynamite.
[01:46:12.592 --> 01:46:14.236]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[01:46:15.398 --> 01:46:17.062]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[01:46:17.142 --> 01:46:17.844]  It's all dynamite.
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:23.262]  They can tell you how great it is, show you all the facts, and tell you, because they're the elite.
[01:46:23.602 --> 01:46:24.322]  I'm just skunk.
[01:46:24.942 --> 01:46:25.843]  Just like you, according to them.
[01:46:25.903 --> 01:46:28.304]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[01:46:28.684 --> 01:46:32.865]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforwarslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[01:46:33.346 --> 01:46:38.428]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience super male vitality, super female vitality.
[01:46:38.608 --> 01:46:48.732]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, super male vitality, super female, because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[01:46:49.272 --> 01:46:50.212]  Because it's so frustrating.
[01:46:50.232 --> 01:46:53.413]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[01:46:53.573 --> 01:46:58.454]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at mfullworthstore.com and mfullworthslife.com.
[01:46:58.634 --> 01:46:59.535]  Thanks for your support.
[01:47:05.796 --> 01:47:08.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.408 --> 01:47:21.491]  Yeah.
[01:47:40.913 --> 01:47:51.743]  I want people to listen to me very, very carefully because by the end of the next hour, I am going to lay out from my deep research, historical research, what all the ancients said and the Bible, what the master plan is.
[01:47:52.884 --> 01:48:04.896]  Because Tim Cook, big tech companies, the CIA research programs, all of it, have believed since the time in the 1850s when Galton, Wedgwood, Huxley,
[01:48:06.494 --> 01:48:11.117]  All of those families, six families, the Blairs were involved on the edge of it, George Orwell.
[01:48:11.757 --> 01:48:19.721]  They all intermarried as part of a British government genetics program that came out of botany, and our guest is a botanist, that's why he knows about all this, from his own perspective.
[01:48:19.741 --> 01:48:20.582]  I haven't even read his books.
[01:48:20.822 --> 01:48:22.303]  We're saying the same stuff because this is what happened.
[01:48:23.083 --> 01:48:23.303]  Okay?
[01:48:23.323 --> 01:48:24.244]  But from different perspectives.
[01:48:25.472 --> 01:48:33.141]  They began to take ayahuasca and other things, and that's where he got his theory of the species and all that, that he brought back from Galapagos.
[01:48:34.122 --> 01:48:42.391]  If you actually read the letters and writings, I've seen documentaries about him, he said that he was communicating with spirits that appeared to be like the classical demons in the Bible.
[01:48:43.272 --> 01:48:45.395]  This is Charles Darwin.
[01:48:47.679 --> 01:48:54.149]  And again, folks, if you've read history books and actually read big volumes about these guys, I remember reading this when I was like 20 years old, reading about Darwin.
[01:48:54.891 --> 01:48:57.895]  And it was just about Darwin's travels and his life and his other theories.
[01:48:58.976 --> 01:49:18.450]  He was told by interdimensional spirits the whole theory of this, and then he came back and told Galton, who's the father of modern eugenics and biometrics and everything, we've got to find the DNA, we've got to find what makes it up, we're going to recode it, we're going to live forever, but we've got to reduce the world population, and we've got to breed our families together to create these supermen.
[01:49:18.770 --> 01:49:23.834]  Well, most have ended up being in mental institutions or dying young, but the Huxley brothers, Aldous
[01:49:24.994 --> 01:49:29.286]  Huxley and his brother, Julian Huxley
[01:49:31.071 --> 01:49:58.239]  Ended up running the entire program, and then at Princeton and other universities, like Berkeley in 61 before he died, Huxley came out, Aldous Huxley, and gave speeches and admitted a lot of this and said, we're gonna have a ruling class that lives to be hundreds and hundreds of years old, but the general public, well first we're gonna splice the sexes, then we're gonna have like four foot tall dwarf creatures that we sexualize with hormones at age three so that they are basically sterile and only live 20 years.
[01:49:59.457 --> 01:50:09.105]  Now, I have articles right here, and we're going to our guest from Mainstream News, where they're now going to give five-year-olds drugs and sterilize them so that they're not boys ever.
[01:50:09.405 --> 01:50:10.426]  Here's an article right here, please.
[01:50:10.706 --> 01:50:13.969]  Britain's first transgender family reveals son five is also transitioning.
[01:50:13.989 --> 01:50:15.130]  This is all Tavistock Institute.
[01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.870]  Same people.
[01:50:16.371 --> 01:50:17.331]  Okay, here's another one.
[01:50:17.372 --> 01:50:21.395]  Google announcing that they're going to stop using the term family because the family is hurtful.
[01:50:22.475 --> 01:50:24.976]  So, Suboid Goblin Creatures.
[01:50:25.616 --> 01:50:35.778]  I'm going to shut up now and go back to our guest here, ladies and gentlemen, and Jan Ervin is our guest, tlogosmedia.com, and we appreciate him.
[01:50:36.259 --> 01:50:42.100]  How much of what I'm saying juxtaposes with what you're wanting to get into, but then I want to just go back to the beginning.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:49.162]  She said we do that first, and talk about Joe's transformation, because I'm really trying to figure out exactly how far down the rat hole he's gone.
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:53.903]  Just to clarify, it's LogosMedia.com, there's no T there.
[01:50:54.383 --> 01:50:56.965]  Just L-O-G-O-S Media dot com.
[01:50:57.005 --> 01:51:07.533]  I also wanted to add to that, Thomas Henry Huxley, Julian and Aldous Huxley's grandfather, was Darwin's propaganda manager, called Darwin's Bulldog.
[01:51:08.053 --> 01:51:22.840]  And so it goes all the way back then and before Thomas Henry Huxley, his father George Huxley was working at the number one private school in the UK teaching people how to be spies and teaching mathematics and stuff like this.
[01:51:22.880 --> 01:51:31.605]  So this goes all the way back through the Huxley family as far back as I can trace it or that I have traced it into the early 1800s.
[01:51:33.451 --> 01:51:35.053]  And I apologize for getting your website wrong.
[01:51:35.073 --> 01:51:35.994]  I've been there many times.
[01:51:36.014 --> 01:51:39.377]  I haven't read your books, but I guess we got sent T-Logos Media as the deal.
[01:51:39.397 --> 01:51:41.319]  But it's LogosMedia.com.
[01:51:41.659 --> 01:51:43.061]  LogosMedia.com.
[01:51:43.862 --> 01:51:46.845]  And also, there's the TriviumEducation.com.
[01:51:46.885 --> 01:51:47.325]  Is that correct?
[01:51:47.966 --> 01:51:48.346]  Correct.
[01:51:48.686 --> 01:51:51.750]  And you and I had actually discussed that site back in 2011.
[01:51:51.850 --> 01:51:52.931]  Go ahead.
[01:51:53.551 --> 01:51:54.913]  Okay, so let's pull back here.
[01:51:56.357 --> 01:51:57.798]  I've never even tried to look into this stuff.
[01:51:57.838 --> 01:51:59.339]  Just studying history, I ran into it.
[01:51:59.599 --> 01:52:01.100]  The learned all know this.
[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:06.384]  I mean, as I just said earlier, they have major university symposiums that are public where they admit this plan.
[01:52:06.404 --> 01:52:09.386]  But let's go to the end and we'll go back to the end later in more detail.
[01:52:09.486 --> 01:52:12.188]  Where are they trying to take us in the endgame?
[01:52:12.508 --> 01:52:17.912]  Why are they trying to overthrow our health, our vision, our intelligence, promising us some promised land?
[01:52:18.533 --> 01:52:27.388]  But really, just like all the other cultures that took these drugs, opened up these gates to lower dimensions, the only revelation they get is from some very fallen, nasty creatures.
[01:52:28.243 --> 01:52:38.745]  Well, Aldous Huxley called it the final revolution, and he wanted to get people so dumbed down to a point from drugs, in the Brave New World he calls it SOMA, etc.
[01:52:39.466 --> 01:52:44.487]  In other articles he talks about dumbing them down with barbiturates, but it was the final revolution.
[01:52:44.507 --> 01:52:53.169]  He wanted people so dumbed down, alpha, betas, deltas, epsilons, etc., that they could not rebel against the elites, against these factions.
[01:52:53.229 --> 01:52:53.529]  Of course,
[01:52:54.749 --> 01:53:17.994]  Aldous Huxley was a Fabian socialist and a lot of these guys were but you know they are all a part of this agenda just to create this final revolution so that the people can never revolt again against the elite and stand up against all of this stuff so they sell pseudo-spirituality you know like like
[01:53:18.514 --> 01:53:27.600]  You mentioned earlier Joe Rogan is now the the head poster boy sort of taking the position of both Timothy Leary and Terrence McKenna.
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:39.828]  Of course Terrence McKenna I exposed years ago that he admitted that he was recruited and worked in public relations and and deep background operations.
[01:53:40.288 --> 01:53:42.870]  And of course all of this was spun against me that
[01:53:43.890 --> 01:53:47.772]  Terrence McKenna was really saying that he was working for the Mushrooms.
[01:53:47.872 --> 01:53:49.273]  I mean, absolutely ridiculous.
[01:53:49.573 --> 01:53:51.254]  He was on the run from the FBI.
[01:53:51.314 --> 01:53:54.075]  He had been caught for smuggling, and they recruited him.
[01:53:54.135 --> 01:53:55.236]  It's as simple as that.
[01:53:55.296 --> 01:53:56.176]  It's cut and dry.
[01:53:56.516 --> 01:53:59.638]  There's been a lot of spin and false attacks against me out there.
[01:54:00.278 --> 01:54:03.880]  Joe Rogan and Dennis McKenna even did attacks on me.
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:10.083]  Joe pretended that he went into my database and just saw a bunch of strings and connections, and it was all guilt by association.
[01:54:11.003 --> 01:54:14.725]  11, 12,000 connections in the database with citations.
[01:54:15.105 --> 01:54:16.346]  Heavy, heavily cited.
[01:54:16.366 --> 01:54:23.810]  You know, people can spend months in there going through my brain database that people can find on the top of my website there.
[01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:28.292]  And just, you know, spend some time going through these connections and reading the citations.
[01:54:28.352 --> 01:54:30.073]  And we're going to get into that next hour.
[01:54:30.473 --> 01:54:40.860]  But we've hit the history of it, and I know what you're saying is, right from these people's own statements, we could play Timothy Leary, you know, saying I work for the CIA, instead of you just reading the quote, and we'll do that next hour.
[01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:44.603]  But let's get into your awakening personalizing you.
[01:54:44.683 --> 01:54:46.244]  People don't like Joe Rogan.
[01:54:46.624 --> 01:54:49.086]  My audience hates it when I'm nice to him, hates it when I talk.
[01:54:49.126 --> 01:54:49.586]  They get it.
[01:54:51.748 --> 01:54:55.991]  But they want to hear about you, a Christian, how you came out of this, how you woke up.
[01:54:56.411 --> 01:55:09.738]  You know, I, in 2009, I got the trivia method from a man by the name of Gino Denning, and I had already been working on my 2008 book, The Holy Mushroom, and that was when I realized that Gordon Wasson and these guys were CIA.
[01:55:09.838 --> 01:55:15.000]  I was pacing back and forth in the backyard one day when it all clicked in my head what was going on.
[01:55:15.401 --> 01:55:18.602]  It took me till 2012 to be able to prove it.
[01:55:19.363 --> 01:55:25.906]  But what happened, you know, was I started going in and all of the people that I was working with, you know, and I was working with about
[01:55:27.086 --> 01:55:40.590]  65 different professors and researchers, and just to give you all an example, I was working on this very large book project, about a thousand pages here, Infusions and Consciousness, a Comprehensive Overview of the Psychedelic Studies.
[01:55:42.130 --> 01:55:51.873]  Two-thirds of the way through the project, I decided not to publish it, and I realized that all of the people that I was working with were on the take, they were dirty,
[01:55:52.353 --> 01:56:01.766]  They were misdirecting people, and I started noticing a pattern as I was going through checking all of their research and everything, and I realized that the whole thing was a fraud.
[01:56:01.786 --> 01:56:03.768]  Yes, they didn't discover mushrooms.
[01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:06.812]  The Vikings were taking them 20,000 years ago.
[01:56:07.533 --> 01:56:08.595]  But let's just stop right there.
[01:56:08.935 --> 01:56:18.645]  I don't even know about that, but we do know that the Aztecs were using this stuff to mind control their victims, like at Montezuma's coronation.
[01:56:19.005 --> 01:56:24.691]  He had up to 8,000 human sacrifices of slaves, and there was a researcher singer
[01:56:25.191 --> 01:56:36.284]  Back in the 50s or 60s that Wasson got into a tiff with because Singer had exposed that the Aztecs were using the mushrooms to prepare their victims for human sacrifice.
[01:56:36.324 --> 01:56:40.489]  And I have some of these quotes here, actually, if we want to get into that later.
[01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:43.173]  But, you know, they twisted the citations.
[01:56:43.853 --> 01:56:49.818]  And, like, here's Diego Duran, History of the Indies of New Spain, and he admits that he was not exaggerating.
[01:56:49.858 --> 01:56:52.581]  Wasson had to omit the entire first paragraph there.
[01:56:52.601 --> 01:56:55.923]  It's from page 407 of his book, and this is from the 1500s.
[01:56:56.023 --> 01:57:05.191]  And when the sacrifices had finished on the steps of the courtyard, or the steps of the courtyard were bathed in human blood, everyone went to eat raw mushrooms.
[01:57:05.591 --> 01:57:09.575]  With this food, they went out of their minds and were in a worse state than if
[01:57:10.156 --> 01:57:17.573]  Then if they had drank a great quantity of wine they became so inebriated and witless that many of them took their lives with their own hands.
[01:57:18.374 --> 01:57:26.916]  And then, under the strong influence of these mushrooms, they saw visions and had revelations about the future since the devil spoke to them in their drunken madness.
[01:57:27.436 --> 01:57:30.916]  But all of this has been published for 500 years.
[01:57:30.976 --> 01:57:33.237]  They've hidden it and... No, I totally agree.
[01:57:33.357 --> 01:57:35.257]  ...and inverted it into a religion.
[01:57:35.337 --> 01:57:35.737]  That's right.
[01:57:36.077 --> 01:57:36.717]  Jan, stay there.
[01:57:36.817 --> 01:57:38.298]  And by the way, I can give you mainstream articles.
[01:57:39.138 --> 01:57:41.318]  The Norse, all of them, the whole planet was taking mushrooms.
[01:57:41.758 --> 01:57:44.219]  So yes, they were taken before they went into war.
[01:57:44.399 --> 01:57:44.939]  So that's true.
[01:57:45.199 --> 01:57:45.759]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:45.779 --> 01:57:46.159]  Stay with us.
[01:57:52.332 --> 01:57:55.255]  Today's left thinks that America is just another country.
[01:57:56.076 --> 01:57:59.118]  Just one of the 190 some countries on the planet.
[01:57:59.499 --> 01:58:01.741]  United States of America is not just another country.
[01:58:02.101 --> 01:58:08.447]  It's the greatest nation in history that has done more good for more people than any country ever.
[01:58:08.767 --> 01:58:11.910]  A special place where people from all over the world
[01:58:13.031 --> 01:58:23.198]  All shapes, all sizes, all colors, all talents come to so they can chase down their goals, chase down their dreams, make life better for themselves and their family.
[01:58:23.238 --> 01:58:24.219]  That's this country.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:32.585]  A special place where people come and respect the Constitution, cherish the Bill of Rights, and embrace the rule of law.
[01:58:33.185 --> 01:58:36.348]  Democrat Congressman Blumenauer said, abolish ICE.
[01:58:37.566 --> 01:58:43.549]  Secretary Clinton, when she was running for the highest office in the land, said we need a borderless hemisphere.
[01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:56.714]  We've learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this, and I want to quote, I will continue speaking out for comprehensive immigration reform.
[01:58:56.935 --> 01:59:00.916]  I think the people who are here deserve a path to citizenship.
[01:59:00.936 --> 01:59:01.897]  Speaker Pelosi,
[01:59:02.537 --> 01:59:03.958]  You said walls are immoral.
[01:59:04.018 --> 01:59:05.760]  A wall is an immorality.
[01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:13.727]  Just last week, Stacey Abrams, governor candidate, state of Georgia, said non-citizens should be able to vote.
[01:59:14.047 --> 01:59:14.628]  Think about that.
[01:59:14.868 --> 01:59:18.651]  So in some cases you would be supportive of non-citizens voting?
[01:59:18.771 --> 01:59:19.472]  I wouldn't oppose it.
[01:59:19.732 --> 01:59:21.413]  She wouldn't oppose it.
[01:59:21.534 --> 01:59:26.518]  It sounds like she is open to non-citizens voting in local elections.
[01:59:26.578 --> 01:59:29.701]  Americans believe that borders need to be strong.
[01:59:29.961 --> 01:59:36.647]  Americans believe, we believe, that there's a difference, a big difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration.
[01:59:37.127 --> 01:59:46.856]  And Americans and Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus believe that a border security wall will help stop drug poverty, the gang problem, and the human trafficking problem.
[01:59:54.815 --> 01:59:58.930]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.432 --> 02:00:00.757]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:29.304 --> 02:00:30.545]  Jan Ervin is our guest.
[02:00:30.645 --> 02:00:33.566]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:00:33.686 --> 02:00:35.727]  You know, I had a whole giant new product.
[02:00:36.807 --> 02:00:45.411]  The biggest product we've launched since we've launched more than 50 products in the last six, seven years at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:00:46.883 --> 02:00:50.505]  Haven't even told you about it because there's no way to really do it justice.
[02:00:51.266 --> 02:00:56.309]  But I probably at the start of the next segment, I'm going to run a one minute ad that basically talks about it.
[02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:58.311]  And it's it's amazing.
[02:00:59.391 --> 02:01:06.296]  This this is the alternative to quote energy drinks, energy pills, all the nootropics that are dirty.
[02:01:07.016 --> 02:01:10.479]  This is we went to top researchers that have spent a lot of money.
[02:01:10.999 --> 02:01:16.523]  I wanted to do this a couple of years ago just to get the researchers from two different firms to give us the information.
[02:01:17.983 --> 02:01:18.843]  That took over a year.
[02:01:19.584 --> 02:01:23.685]  And then there was a year getting it developed because it's so clean and so good.
[02:01:23.705 --> 02:01:25.325]  And wait till we launch this new product.
[02:01:25.365 --> 02:01:26.625]  I'm very, very excited about it.
[02:01:27.325 --> 02:01:33.227]  And quite frankly, well, just wait till you use it.
[02:01:33.367 --> 02:01:37.928]  I believe this is going to end up being the number one pre-workout
[02:01:40.131 --> 02:01:41.432]  Long-haul truck driving.
[02:01:41.472 --> 02:01:43.153]  I mean, you name it, but in a healthy way.
[02:01:43.273 --> 02:01:44.094]  Wait till we launch it.
[02:01:44.954 --> 02:01:47.356]  Probably tomorrow or so, but I'm going to talk about it a little bit in the next segment.
[02:01:48.817 --> 02:01:50.738]  Jan Ervin is a very interesting fellow.
[02:01:50.798 --> 02:01:51.339]  Very smart.
[02:01:51.439 --> 02:01:56.322]  Everything he's saying, I basically have researched on my own, and I think it's accurate.
[02:01:56.562 --> 02:02:00.225]  We were just talking about the Unabomber being in the CIA.
[02:02:00.285 --> 02:02:01.025]  I showed that article.
[02:02:01.045 --> 02:02:02.867]  We've got to print those actual articles out.
[02:02:03.641 --> 02:02:08.585]  I'm impressed he's done his research on that and he thinks this is part of the brainwashing to push a pagan, drug-addled Europe idea as if we should accept it as our new culture.
[02:02:29.028 --> 02:02:44.893]  Absolutely correct, and the main person who promoted the idea of the Berserker Rage being Amanita Muscaria Mushrooms was, again, Professor Karl Rock out of Boston University, whom I exposed in the last segment, whom I think should be investigated for academic fraud.
[02:02:44.933 --> 02:02:46.173]  I've read his books and things.
[02:02:46.693 --> 02:02:51.316]  But he worked with and Gordon Wasson worked with Robert Graves.
[02:02:51.777 --> 02:03:01.383]  Part of that pagan history was created by Sir James George Fraser of the Royal Society and the Royal Society is a big spinner of false science and things like that.
[02:03:01.943 --> 02:03:09.989]  Aldous or Julian Huxley was a member of the Royal Society as was Darwin and you know a lot of these families but they're really behind that.
[02:03:10.049 --> 02:03:16.373]  Another one who sold the pagan history thing is Mircea Eliade out of the Chicago University who was
[02:03:16.953 --> 02:03:32.626]  Also, working for the CIA, and he was the professor of guys like Robert Forte, who were the first guys to... Robert Forte basically set up the first street drug lab for MDMA to help that get on the street.
[02:03:32.646 --> 02:03:41.794]  You know, set up by Sasha Shulgin, who was working for the DEA and also was bohemian and stuff like that.
[02:03:41.854 --> 02:03:45.437]  So, a lot of these guys were on the inside and on the
[02:03:46.558 --> 02:03:48.459]  I don't trust a lot of their research.
[02:03:48.499 --> 02:03:55.165]  I've been working on a project to expose the false quote-unquote pagan history of Europe.
[02:03:55.225 --> 02:04:03.051]  I think the Europeans always worshipped Logos, or truth is God, and I think that this has been a manufactured history put on them.
[02:04:03.111 --> 02:04:04.212]  That is my own opinion.
[02:04:04.933 --> 02:04:11.518]  It's in the early preliminary stages of that research, but I think within the next year or so we'll be able to prove that.
[02:04:11.618 --> 02:04:37.068]  Well, you're a smart guy, and I think as Christ said, he had other flocks, so his spirit was in the earth, and I think that's validated, but the Bible warns of all the different tribes getting into Pharmaceia and how that opened up gates to the devil, and I think clearly, though, they've dug up stuff all over Europe, and I have family that were archaeologists, and they do find that everybody had the apothecary, who a lot of times was taking some of his own stuff, and would get into darkness because they were taking it.
[02:04:37.188 --> 02:04:37.968]  But witchcraft.
[02:04:37.988 --> 02:04:40.329]  But Genesis 3 warns against this stuff, too.
[02:04:40.789 --> 02:04:49.551]  No, I know, but I think to say that every ancient culture had this going on, places where it took over, you had the Aztecs, where the demons told them, kill everybody who's handsome and smart.
[02:04:50.011 --> 02:04:51.892]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:04:52.432 --> 02:04:54.812]  It's a damn, like, evil, interdimensional broadcast.
[02:04:54.852 --> 02:04:56.373]  Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourselves.
[02:04:56.733 --> 02:04:57.673]  And now it's all over the news.
[02:04:57.713 --> 02:04:59.794]  Kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself.
[02:05:03.874 --> 02:05:04.355]  Here's the thing.
[02:05:04.375 --> 02:05:05.795]  I know how metaphysics work.
[02:05:05.895 --> 02:05:07.035]  I know how the universe works.
[02:05:07.715 --> 02:05:09.736]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[02:05:10.965 --> 02:05:14.586]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:05:15.507 --> 02:05:18.708]  I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[02:05:19.948 --> 02:05:22.249]  And that would be a very true statement.
[02:05:22.269 --> 02:05:28.332]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[02:05:29.372 --> 02:05:34.254]  If I fight as hard as I can, and people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[02:05:35.783 --> 02:05:38.504]  You support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:05:38.924 --> 02:05:40.124]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[02:05:40.144 --> 02:05:40.884]  We'll be here forever.
[02:05:41.265 --> 02:05:42.385]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:05:43.545 --> 02:05:51.747]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, when we struggled here, we made it.
[02:05:52.127 --> 02:05:56.329]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[02:05:57.049 --> 02:05:59.609]  Probably brought you the whole family of InfoWars products.
[02:06:00.090 --> 02:06:01.230]  Without you, we won't be here.
[02:06:05.922 --> 02:06:07.564]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:08.045 --> 02:06:20.359]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:06:20.439 --> 02:06:25.105]  Millions of dollars would be spent on LSD research at universities throughout the country.
[02:06:25.698 --> 02:06:29.981]  And word would begin to spread on campus about this so-called mind-blowing drug.
[02:06:30.461 --> 02:06:33.743]  And suddenly, it was the counterculture of the 60s.
[02:06:33.923 --> 02:06:43.929]  I give the CIA a total credit for sponsoring and initiating the entire consciousness movement, counterculture events of the 1960s.
[02:06:44.329 --> 02:06:48.652]  Dr. Timothy Leary, the 1960s Johnny Appleseed of LSD.
[02:06:50.470 --> 02:06:57.096]  The CIA funded and supported and encouraged hundreds of young psychiatrists to experiment with this drug.
[02:06:58.338 --> 02:07:06.826]  The fallout from that was that the young psychologists began taking it themselves, discovering that it was an intelligence-enhancing, consciousness-raising experience.
[02:07:07.406 --> 02:07:10.829]  I know that some of the studies in which the CIA had
[02:07:11.970 --> 02:07:18.253]  Supported, used as subjects, people who later became strong proselytizers of LSD.
[02:07:18.293 --> 02:07:27.856]  So, you know, in that sense, yes, I think it did sustain the perpetuation of the use of the drug.
[02:07:28.376 --> 02:07:29.797]  And it's rather ironic, isn't it?
[02:07:32.273 --> 02:07:43.323]  Kind of like Dr. Salk and the top scientists that he worked with going on NPR before they died and saying, and going on PBS, oh, we knew that all the shots had SV40 cancer virus.
[02:07:43.863 --> 02:07:45.945]  Killed about 99 million people in the U.S.
[02:07:47.186 --> 02:07:48.267]  But there are too many people.
[02:07:49.909 --> 02:07:51.310]  Should I dig that clip up for you?
[02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:56.054]  Or how about Walter Cronkite saying, I sit at the right hand of Satan.
[02:07:57.035 --> 02:07:57.415]  Hail Satan.
[02:07:57.435 --> 02:07:58.356]  You want me to play that for you?
[02:07:58.376 --> 02:07:59.217]  Because they're not joking around.
[02:08:00.447 --> 02:08:04.933]  In fact, the last time I talked to Joe, he basically said, no, there's another problem, Alex.
[02:08:04.953 --> 02:08:06.295]  There's another problem where people are upset with you.
[02:08:07.396 --> 02:08:11.282]  And I basically figured it out talking to him, but he wouldn't say it.
[02:08:11.422 --> 02:08:12.103]  He said, I'm a Christian.
[02:08:13.465 --> 02:08:14.746]  And that's what this comes down to.
[02:08:14.766 --> 02:08:16.267]  So let me ask questions this segment.
[02:08:16.747 --> 02:08:17.588]  You can keep rolling.
[02:08:17.748 --> 02:08:21.130]  I know you want to get into academic stuff and you're a botanist and the trailblazer.
[02:08:21.150 --> 02:08:29.396]  And I've looked at you're the guy that was introducing DMT to Joe, both figuratively and literally as an idea and as a substance.
[02:08:29.896 --> 02:08:34.800]  And then you figured out that you were being handled and being put forward by the Puppet Masters.
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:37.622]  Don Irvin is our guest, LogosMedia.com.
[02:08:38.582 --> 02:08:40.804]  But humor me to go through these different pieces of this.
[02:08:40.864 --> 02:08:42.225]  And again, if you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:44.000]  Washington Post.
[02:08:44.661 --> 02:08:47.623]  CIA infiltrated 17 area groups, gave out LSD.
[02:08:48.963 --> 02:08:50.084]  Okay, this is from the 60s.
[02:08:50.504 --> 02:08:54.267]  This came out in 1973, a year before I was born.
[02:08:54.667 --> 02:08:56.448]  Panel finds CIA broke law.
[02:08:57.288 --> 02:08:57.949]  Defends record.
[02:08:59.590 --> 02:09:00.230]  So there you go.
[02:09:00.490 --> 02:09:06.554]  And I've talked to family that was at UT in the mid-60s, and the government was there putting out the LSD on campus.
[02:09:07.813 --> 02:09:08.333]  I can tell you.
[02:09:08.934 --> 02:09:10.375]  And so it goes way beyond that.
[02:09:10.415 --> 02:09:17.820]  Now they're giving you the super hardcore mind control drugs that they believe open up a dimensional gate where they are given advanced knowledge.
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:23.844]  But to then build what the entities want built on this side to open a gate.
[02:09:24.524 --> 02:09:26.345]  Or turn their atmosphere into what they're building.
[02:09:26.645 --> 02:09:28.365]  They're changing our world into theirs.
[02:09:28.405 --> 02:09:29.865]  Now, people say, this is crazy.
[02:09:29.925 --> 02:09:30.105]  No, no.
[02:09:30.206 --> 02:09:34.046]  I'm telling you from research what the adherents in Silicon Valley think.
[02:09:34.507 --> 02:09:38.188]  Why Tim Cook's got eyes the size of saucers under big lights.
[02:09:38.768 --> 02:09:40.828]  Because the guy is on some type of high-tech drug.
[02:09:41.288 --> 02:09:44.169]  And they're all literally on drugs all the time.
[02:09:44.429 --> 02:09:46.510]  It's admitted in mainstream news, quote, micro-dosing.
[02:09:46.910 --> 02:09:48.930]  Well, that's how they trick you to start taking it every day.
[02:09:49.450 --> 02:09:51.431]  They're not micro-dosing, they're mega-dosing.
[02:09:52.031 --> 02:09:54.593]  That's why they all die so young, like Steve Jobs.
[02:09:55.133 --> 02:09:58.516]  That's why Steve Jobs wouldn't let his kids have iPads or phones before he died.
[02:09:58.536 --> 02:10:00.017]  That's why Bill Gates won't do it.
[02:10:00.077 --> 02:10:02.979]  So, Jan, you can come back, by the way, many times.
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:06.482]  I mean, I love you to death, and you click with the show, and you know what you're talking about.
[02:10:06.502 --> 02:10:10.185]  But this is out of the Commission on CIA Activities in the United States.
[02:10:10.225 --> 02:10:11.406]  That's the Unabomber.
[02:10:11.846 --> 02:10:13.707]  Was in a CIA mind-control program.
[02:10:13.988 --> 02:10:14.928]  Timothy McVeigh was.
[02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.910]  Sirhan Sirhan.
[02:10:18.257 --> 02:10:24.834]  This has all been in the newspaper, but when I say it, they go, oh, that's a conspiracy theory thinking we don't have the actual news clipping like I just showed people.
[02:10:24.914 --> 02:10:25.054]  So...
[02:10:26.656 --> 02:10:28.437]  This is a breakaway civilization.
[02:10:29.037 --> 02:10:30.937]  They believe they're taking over.
[02:10:31.037 --> 02:10:35.879]  From your experience, mid-level and then high-level, what do the average adherents of this think?
[02:10:36.319 --> 02:10:37.699]  What do they think they're part of?
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:44.261]  Do they not know the bigger, more sinister interdimensional invasion plan that this really is?
[02:10:44.582 --> 02:10:45.942]  And yes, folks, that's what it is.
[02:10:46.222 --> 02:10:47.182]  Next year's news today.
[02:10:47.582 --> 02:10:49.003]  In a couple years, you'll hear this everywhere.
[02:10:49.343 --> 02:10:51.025]  And people are going to be like, I'm with the invasion!
[02:10:51.265 --> 02:10:52.286]  I'm with what they're offering!
[02:10:52.326 --> 02:11:01.537]  It's why these billionaire people are saying that we're really alternate dimensions, and this one is held by something sinister, and we're going to build alternate dimensions, and we're going to have a rebellion within dimensions.
[02:11:02.118 --> 02:11:02.778]  The Bible again.
[02:11:02.959 --> 02:11:04.340]  Lucifer and the angels, one-third.
[02:11:04.801 --> 02:11:08.044]  So, they're already introducing, we're going to have reality competition.
[02:11:08.064 --> 02:11:09.686]  We're going to have competing realities now.
[02:11:10.287 --> 02:11:15.610]  But first you have to overthrow the existing logos, or God's truth, or worshipping truth, God.
[02:11:16.030 --> 02:11:24.395]  So I understand what you're saying, Jan, but let's get into the adherents themselves so that they can know that we know more than they know, which is the only way to get them out of it.
[02:11:24.455 --> 02:11:33.220]  So if you want real knowledge below the dimensions you're in, but actually above them, you need to understand that this is the real way of truth.
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:54.790]  So, so, so, explain to people your deep research, what you believe the endgame of this is, not just ending the family and exterminating humanity, but who's running it, who's behind it, and what the DMT does, what the ayahuasca does, what these molecules do, really, in the brain, and why these loving entities are there, lovey cutie-caking on people, if they think they can trick you, as spirit guides.
[02:11:55.210 --> 02:11:59.192]  If they can't, they'll try to torture the hell out of you and make you die in that state.
[02:11:59.532 --> 02:12:01.313]  That's the real experience, is why it's so dangerous.
[02:12:02.298 --> 02:12:09.163]  Well, the drugs cause hypersuggestion first and foremost, and I'm glad that you brought up microdosing.
[02:12:09.183 --> 02:12:19.591]  That was actually launched by Dr. James Fadiman, who was the last doctor to do legal LSD research under MKUltra in 1970 or 71.
[02:12:19.631 --> 02:12:20.632]  I actually interviewed him years ago.
[02:12:24.054 --> 02:12:31.885]  And then when I began exposing all of this, he actually came out attacking me and trying to spend my research.
[02:12:32.245 --> 02:12:36.171]  But there was a whole team under Dr. Henry A. Murray at Harvard.
[02:12:36.937 --> 02:12:41.339]  Which included Larry and many of these other guys.
[02:12:41.659 --> 02:12:49.882]  And Ted Kaczynski was a part of the experiments done under Henry A. Murray's department.
[02:12:50.442 --> 02:12:55.224]  And Kaczynski inadvertently had enough of it.
[02:12:55.304 --> 02:13:00.226]  He later figured out what was going on when he was professor of mathematics at
[02:13:00.826 --> 02:13:01.446]  We're good to go.
[02:13:27.913 --> 02:13:28.674]  Hold on one second.
[02:13:28.694 --> 02:13:33.939]  I know you love to get into all the academic background and who these people are, and we'll do that and we'll do future shows, but big picture for people.
[02:13:34.900 --> 02:13:35.961]  What do they believe?
[02:13:36.041 --> 02:13:39.183]  I mean, I know what they're doing, and I've actually talked with some of these people.
[02:13:39.604 --> 02:13:50.414]  They believe they are in connection with advanced technologies and with interdimensional beings, and they believe they're getting this advanced knowledge and then building these systems in this dimension
[02:13:50.814 --> 02:13:55.598]  And that somehow they're going to be rewarded, but first they've got to reduce the world population down to basically zero.
[02:13:55.618 --> 02:13:57.360]  They've got to merge with Silicon Gods.
[02:13:58.161 --> 02:14:04.847]  They've got to do everything that Elon Musk came on Joe Rogan's show and repeated word for word what I said when Joe asked him about the nature of reality.
[02:14:04.867 --> 02:14:07.729]  So I'm telling people, Jesus is offering eternal life.
[02:14:08.638 --> 02:14:13.781]  They're saying you get it here on this planet by loading your consciousness into a computer, but your body has to die.
[02:14:14.242 --> 02:14:17.123]  I was saying that 20 years ago, now that was all over the news yesterday.
[02:14:17.163 --> 02:14:19.705]  So they're going operational with this is what I'm saying.
[02:14:20.185 --> 02:14:30.872]  There was a doctor by the name of Dr. Andrea Pujaric working with the Esalen Institute, etc., who ran the Council of Nine, and that's exactly what they claim to have been doing.
[02:14:31.212 --> 02:14:35.495]  He was working with CIA and Mossad agent Yuri Geller, and he
[02:14:36.275 --> 02:14:38.556]  Also did the Betty and Barney Hill thing.
[02:14:38.896 --> 02:14:41.877]  He was behind that with John G. Fuller.
[02:14:41.957 --> 02:14:48.259]  He had worked with John G. Fuller down in Brazil on a lot of those, you know, mind control projects.
[02:14:48.299 --> 02:14:49.679]  John G. Fuller is who did the
[02:14:52.310 --> 02:15:01.177]  Ponce in a spree attack on the village in France where they killed six or seven people there and dosed the entire village and made people go crazy.
[02:15:01.697 --> 02:15:09.903]  But that was all part of the CIA's MKUltra program ties into Andrea Pujaric and what you were just saying about this interdimensional stuff.
[02:15:09.963 --> 02:15:15.647]  Aside from Andrea Pujaric's team, I don't know how many of them are involved in it on that level or not.
[02:15:15.787 --> 02:15:16.388]  I don't know.
[02:15:16.868 --> 02:15:19.590]  But anyway, you know, we can go on from there.
[02:15:20.802 --> 02:15:23.665]  All right, when we come back, folks want to know about this.
[02:15:23.685 --> 02:15:32.994]  They want to hear it on the ground level about you and Joe and the first time you got him to take DMT and what, on average, people do see when they take DMT.
[02:15:33.695 --> 02:15:35.497]  But again, folks, I've never taken DMT.
[02:15:36.578 --> 02:15:42.364]  And you need to understand that DMT, ayahuasca, most of the groups getting you into it,
[02:15:42.944 --> 02:15:45.127]  Know that you'll never have an experience like it again.
[02:15:45.147 --> 02:15:51.193]  And whether you have a bad experience or a good experience, they want to program you in the state that they're the guru.
[02:15:51.634 --> 02:15:54.957]  This is how the CIA put little kids under mind control and adults.
[02:15:55.478 --> 02:15:59.202]  So these are mind control groups, cults, operating out in the open.
[02:15:59.342 --> 02:16:00.083]  Be warned.
[02:16:05.765 --> 02:16:08.446]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:16:08.806 --> 02:16:14.708]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:16:15.248 --> 02:16:27.232]  TurboForce from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[02:16:30.714 --> 02:16:34.455]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!

[02:16:50.724 --> 02:16:52.165]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[02:16:52.746 --> 02:16:55.570]  Perk up with Turbo Force at infowarstore.com.
[02:17:05.686 --> 02:17:07.709]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new year is here.
[02:17:08.189 --> 02:17:23.307]  And I personally, in the new year, am looking at all the great supplements and products at EnforcedLife.com and saying, what do I need to take religiously that I'm forgetting to take, that lowers inflammation, that empowers all the cells in the body, that makes me healthier, better stamina, libido, energy?
[02:17:23.547 --> 02:17:24.529]  And it's these three babies.
[02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:54.389]  It's body's ultimate turmeric formula with 95% curcuminoid nobody else can top that top the line in the nation It's x3 that has all three of the good types of iodine together including the deep-earth crystal Iodine because people can't absorb that type we put a little bit of the other two types and a tiny bit of vitamin C Stabilize it and then super male and super female vitality super male vitality spin our overall most successful product neck-and-neck with brain force plus
[02:17:55.189 --> 02:18:01.355]  But because it's wildcrafted in a proprietary process, we weren't able to get it for long periods of time.
[02:18:02.276 --> 02:18:06.700]  And so I made the decision just to discontinue it and try to reformulate.
[02:18:07.161 --> 02:18:09.003]  But it's been very, very hard to do.
[02:18:09.083 --> 02:18:11.625]  So we're not discontinuing it because it's crap.
[02:18:11.745 --> 02:18:13.988]  We're discontinuing it because we can't get it.
[02:18:14.068 --> 02:18:17.831]  It may come back in the future, but right now we're just not able to bring it.
[02:18:17.851 --> 02:18:19.072]  This is our last run of it.
[02:18:19.633 --> 02:18:20.374]  We're proud, Terry.
[02:18:20.694 --> 02:18:21.155]  Amazing.
[02:18:21.395 --> 02:18:22.797]  It's at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:18:23.177 --> 02:18:24.759]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[02:18:25.359 --> 02:18:28.083]  Or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[02:18:28.583 --> 02:18:29.084]  Bodies.
[02:18:29.704 --> 02:18:30.265]  Turmeric.
[02:18:30.766 --> 02:18:31.266]  Formula.
[02:18:31.506 --> 02:18:33.869]  And it's supercharged with other key ingredients.
[02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:35.451]  Supercharge it.
[02:18:35.471 --> 02:18:36.231]  Bring it to the next level.
[02:18:36.952 --> 02:18:38.353]  And then, of course, it's the X3.
[02:18:38.373 --> 02:18:41.275]  It's our final run of X2.
[02:18:41.315 --> 02:18:52.944]  We've secured the Deep Earth Iodine, but I thought we'd make a better one with all three types and the vitamin C. So get your X2, get your X3, all at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[02:18:53.204 --> 02:18:57.987]  And again, have a great New Year as we fight the globalists and restore the Republic and freedom to the planet.
[02:18:58.127 --> 02:18:58.608]  Thank you all.
[02:19:02.452 --> 02:19:03.833]  Because we need border security.
[02:19:03.853 --> 02:19:04.533]  We have to have it.
[02:19:04.933 --> 02:19:07.894]  Should've happened 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.
[02:19:09.215 --> 02:19:10.195]  And it's gonna happen now.
[02:19:10.675 --> 02:19:11.296]  Gonna happen now.
[02:19:11.316 --> 02:19:12.536]  Thank you very much, everybody.
[02:19:13.136 --> 02:19:14.497]  Enjoy your food.
[02:19:14.717 --> 02:19:20.720]  There's the juxtaposed of golden candle stick holders with candles and then all this fast food.
[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:22.000]  Trump is ridiculous.
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:23.981]  He's the ultimate joker card.
[02:19:26.407 --> 02:19:30.190]  But meanwhile, he says we've got burgers stacked a mile high.
[02:19:30.471 --> 02:19:33.353]  They spit it that he's lying when it's a figure of speech.
[02:19:34.294 --> 02:19:39.878]  And I didn't see anybody complaining when Barack Obama was spending $65,000 on hot dog dinners.
[02:19:40.479 --> 02:19:44.022]  Nobody cared to mention that in the mainstream press or ridicule him.
[02:19:44.082 --> 02:19:48.866]  And Obama always made a big deal of going out for fast food, or the press did at least, when he did.
[02:19:48.886 --> 02:19:49.346]  Oh, it's well known.
[02:19:49.386 --> 02:19:52.789]  Trump likes tacos, and Obama likes wieners.
[02:20:06.366 --> 02:20:10.908]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:22.974 --> 02:20:26.956]  Bang your head!
[02:20:28.776 --> 02:20:29.537]  Wake the dead!
[02:20:30.857 --> 02:20:31.978]  We're all metal, man!
[02:20:32.864 --> 02:20:34.305]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:34.545 --> 02:20:35.706]  Well, so does he.
[02:20:36.207 --> 02:20:40.951]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:41.411 --> 02:20:45.575]  You know, you hear this song when you're nine years old and you think it doesn't make any sense.
[02:20:46.435 --> 02:20:49.838]  Once you study the globalists and what they're really up to, listen to this carefully.
[02:20:51.580 --> 02:20:54.502]  Towards the end of the song, though, is where it really tells you what's going on.
[02:20:58.183 --> 02:21:04.008]  By the end they explained, bang your head, wake the dead.
[02:21:04.228 --> 02:21:06.130]  It's all you have now.
[02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:07.851]  Join the pack.
[02:21:08.052 --> 02:21:09.733]  Feel the crack.
[02:21:24.633 --> 02:21:32.367]  It's all about, ladies and gentlemen, accessing certain race consciousness memories, but only certain ones.
[02:21:32.387 --> 02:21:35.673]  Now let me tell you something here.
[02:21:37.456 --> 02:21:38.017]  I grew up
[02:21:39.258 --> 02:21:44.420]  Because my mom's a historian, my dad's a doctor, and they went to UT, and my dad went to UT when he was in high school.
[02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:50.182]  He was, you know, one of the top six high scores in his SATs or whatever they were called then.
[02:21:50.202 --> 02:21:52.943]  So he was in a Plan 2 program and all that.
[02:21:53.683 --> 02:22:00.026]  And I just grew up hearing conversations and things with their friends over from places like San Francisco.
[02:22:00.046 --> 02:22:06.008]  And I remember sitting there when my mom's college friend who came by a few times a year
[02:22:07.554 --> 02:22:18.405]  Would sit there and just lay out the different programs, the different groups, and this is the research they were doing, and I hear terms like CIA, and my parents weren't in that.
[02:22:18.705 --> 02:22:29.276]  They just knew people that were like, oh yeah, we're out here in San Francisco and we're testing different drugs, and you know, we've broken through the dimensional gates and we're communicating with the elves, the clockwork elves and all this stuff.
[02:22:29.296 --> 02:22:31.017]  So I heard all that stuff for anybody putting a book.
[02:22:31.638 --> 02:22:34.039]  There's a little kid here about elves, you know, in a conversation.
[02:22:34.639 --> 02:22:36.699]  While your parents are sitting around the dinner table, it's pretty interesting.
[02:22:37.239 --> 02:22:39.360]  My parents are straightforward, you know, professional people.
[02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:42.061]  And they were Christians.
[02:22:42.081 --> 02:22:43.401]  They're like, well, that sounds like demons.
[02:22:44.221 --> 02:22:48.702]  And then, you know, their friend's like, oh, no, you just don't get it, blah, blah, blah.
[02:22:49.883 --> 02:22:55.384]  And when my mom really, really became a hardcore Christian over the years, her friend finally said, you know, I don't like you.
[02:22:55.404 --> 02:22:56.084]  You're a Christian.
[02:22:57.045 --> 02:22:58.085]  And we just don't want to be around you anymore.
[02:22:59.511 --> 02:23:07.796]  So that's what this comes down to at the final equation, is that there's a bunch of hidden stuff.
[02:23:07.816 --> 02:23:09.257]  That's what a cult means going on.
[02:23:10.277 --> 02:23:14.159]  And the establishment doesn't want you to know what's really going on.
[02:23:14.179 --> 02:23:17.882]  They want to control a little bit of it and only let you see what they want you to see.
[02:23:20.243 --> 02:23:22.004]  And so I think that's what we're coming down to here.
[02:23:23.473 --> 02:23:28.835]  But you have to understand, since then I have read what the globalists actually say in their white papers.
[02:23:29.515 --> 02:23:45.720]  And when they go to these billionaire Silicon Valley retreats where there's like 300 people there, they are all obsessed with what they're building and the things they've made deals with, and they can't believe how good all this stuff works that they get told.
[02:23:46.898 --> 02:23:49.939]  And they're all arguing how many people are going to be left on earth.
[02:23:49.999 --> 02:23:52.840]  And, well, the entities say we've got to kill everybody to transcend.
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:56.501]  It kind of becomes a repeat of the Gnostic thing from thousands of years ago.
[02:23:56.541 --> 02:23:58.341]  We've got to kill everybody, and then we're all equal.
[02:23:59.742 --> 02:24:05.824]  And it just goes on and on, like the Muslim belief that Armageddon happens, but then God just kills everybody.
[02:24:06.424 --> 02:24:07.184]  We don't even go to heaven.
[02:24:07.224 --> 02:24:08.264]  We just cease to exist.
[02:24:08.885 --> 02:24:11.085]  So you can't get more satanic than this.
[02:24:11.926 --> 02:24:13.806]  And it's a transmission.
[02:24:13.866 --> 02:24:14.486]  Kill yourselves.
[02:24:14.526 --> 02:24:15.127]  Destroy yourselves.
[02:24:15.187 --> 02:24:15.827]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[02:24:17.287 --> 02:24:19.288]  Jan Ervin, we got a longer segment coming up.
[02:24:19.308 --> 02:24:22.448]  This is a short segment, but get in to Joe Rogan.
[02:24:22.488 --> 02:24:27.810]  Get into, because people want to know about that specifically, because it's interesting and about the process.
[02:24:27.850 --> 02:24:30.250]  So people also know how dangerous it is if you take DMT.
[02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:32.111]  You and Joe had a good experience.
[02:24:32.211 --> 02:24:34.191]  Eddie Bravo, who's a wonderful guy, not part of this.
[02:24:34.571 --> 02:24:35.672]  He did not have a good experience.
[02:24:35.912 --> 02:24:39.793]  So go ahead and reveal for the first time ever when you got Joe Rogan to take DMT.
[02:24:40.693 --> 02:24:45.414]  Well, we were at Joe's house and his house in Bell Canyon.
[02:24:46.409 --> 02:24:51.593]  And this was, like I said, 2003-2004 in his little movie theater that he had there.
[02:24:51.613 --> 02:24:59.419]  And, you know, I had been doing research on it, and I believed all the hype by guys like Dr. Rick Strassman,
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:17.563]  Who did the DMT The Spirit Molecule book and he's really the one that hyped all of this originally and his book which you can't verify really any of it because it's behind confidential research reports from the people who participated in his study which was funded by the Scottish Rite Freemasonry.
[02:25:18.243 --> 02:25:25.425]  But we were at Joe's place and I don't remember who went first but there was a guy Johnny there also
[02:25:26.045 --> 02:25:34.248]  And we all just took our turns, you know, it's, it's, you know, you do kind of see some bizarre sort of demonic world.
[02:25:34.288 --> 02:25:38.209]  A lot of people claim to see elves and, and different sorts of creatures in there.
[02:25:38.269 --> 02:25:44.231]  I saw sort of a checkerboard sort of world with round and different shaped objects.
[02:25:44.271 --> 02:25:47.072]  Which again is very Masonic, very, very M.C.
[02:25:47.152 --> 02:25:47.432]  Escher.
[02:25:48.172 --> 02:25:50.013]  Yeah, well, yeah, yeah, true that.
[02:25:52.327 --> 02:25:55.230]  But Eddie Bravo actually kind of had a bad trip.
[02:25:55.250 --> 02:26:02.397]  And of course, Eddie Bravo is a fighter and he's the only guy who took down Horsey Gracie in a fight back then.
[02:26:03.198 --> 02:26:03.819]  Jiu-Jitsu.
[02:26:04.460 --> 02:26:07.262]  And, you know, he didn't have a good experience.
[02:26:07.302 --> 02:26:08.344]  He started trying to fight.
[02:26:08.384 --> 02:26:14.310]  I was glad that Joe was there because at least Joe knew Jiu-Jitsu to try to help control Eddie from
[02:26:14.890 --> 02:26:20.552]  Well, I mean, I wouldn't say he was... He just wanted to fight in general and fight everybody in the room.
[02:26:34.111 --> 02:26:41.157]  Yeah, we are lucky he didn't break both of our necks because, you know, I'm no jiu-jitsu fighter and I couldn't have taken Eddie on.
[02:26:41.177 --> 02:26:42.237]  I couldn't have talked him down.
[02:26:42.317 --> 02:26:45.300]  So, I'm glad that Joe was there to be able to do that.
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:49.143]  But, yeah, you know, it was a bad idea.
[02:26:49.163 --> 02:26:56.648]  You described Joe taking it, and this is interesting, and Joe made no secret about this, but describe Joe on DMT versus Eddie, what Eddie took.
[02:26:58.089 --> 02:27:05.991]  Joe just kind of sat back in the couch and relaxed and went into his little world for six or seven minutes and came out very peacefully.
[02:27:06.611 --> 02:27:15.853]  But Eddie went full-blown fight mode like he was on the MMA mat or the UFC mat.
[02:27:15.973 --> 02:27:16.954]  Yeah, like that.
[02:27:17.774 --> 02:27:21.575]  Getting ready or in the middle of a full-blown fight and so
[02:27:22.475 --> 02:27:27.559]  You know, there's no way that me or Johnny could have handled that guy.
[02:27:27.639 --> 02:27:30.421]  You know, and I still talk to Eddie on occasion.
[02:27:30.461 --> 02:27:31.242]  He's a good guy.
[02:27:31.262 --> 02:27:35.505]  What did Eddie tell you he saw?
[02:27:35.585 --> 02:27:36.506]  What made him so upset?
[02:27:37.927 --> 02:27:41.429]  I don't know what he saw exactly.
[02:27:41.469 --> 02:27:44.732]  I mean, these experiences are wild, but he just thought that
[02:27:45.379 --> 02:27:50.462]  You know, he was in a fight and ready on the mat, ready to fight, ready to go.
[02:27:50.482 --> 02:27:56.266]  I just want to warn people, if you're really inherently good, and Eddie really is a good spirit, you can feel it, he really is a good person.
[02:27:56.366 --> 02:27:58.107]  These demons know and attack the hell out of you.
[02:27:58.627 --> 02:28:06.693]  And I know people in this building who are really good people who took it, and it's experience I had without ever taking it in deep dreams and things when I was younger.
[02:28:06.713 --> 02:28:10.435]  We'll talk about when we come back, but you're basically transported to another dimension.
[02:28:10.735 --> 02:28:11.536]  It's like a spaceship.
[02:28:12.176 --> 02:28:34.811]  And there's demons, and there's people all basically, you can see their spirits, all it is, and they're all slaves, and there's these horrible creatures, you're in a lower dimension, that are like torturing them forever, and then they go, oh, you're here, you're gonna die, we're strangling you, your heart ventricles are failing, we're gonna rip you, and when you believe me, you'll never escape, and if you have kids, we'll get them too, and we're gonna tear down your world unless you join us, and then you might be able to be at our level.
[02:28:35.051 --> 02:28:39.114]  Then they start threatening you, like an interrogation to join them, and saying, we know this, and we know that,
[02:28:39.854 --> 02:28:40.915]  We trust the power.
[02:29:06.004 --> 02:29:08.685]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:29:09.026 --> 02:29:14.929]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:29:15.469 --> 02:29:27.476]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[02:30:05.967 --> 02:30:13.830]  You've got Alexandra Cortez coming out saying CBS is racist and bad because they didn't send a black reporter to cover her for Congress.
[02:30:14.010 --> 02:30:16.011]  But she says, better get better next time.
[02:30:16.091 --> 02:30:19.993]  That's why to counter her and to get back in her face whenever she said that Don Jr.
[02:30:20.093 --> 02:30:23.914]  might face prison time for making the point that, you know, she loves Venezuela so much.
[02:30:24.034 --> 02:30:25.435]  In Venezuela, they eat their dogs.
[02:30:25.575 --> 02:30:28.156]  In capitalist countries like America, we walk our dogs.
[02:30:28.436 --> 02:30:33.540]  So, I came up with the idea for this little baby, and we have this as a limited edition, but I want it to be a bestseller.
[02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:34.861]  This is the first limited edition.
[02:30:34.881 --> 02:30:36.002]  We have another design coming out.
[02:30:36.302 --> 02:30:39.165]  There's only a few thousand of these, but we want this to be a huge seller.
[02:30:39.425 --> 02:30:43.308]  We want to put 50,000, 100,000 out of these like we've done Hillary for President.
[02:30:43.948 --> 02:30:47.791]  And it says, Capitalists walk their dogs, Socialists eat them.
[02:30:48.592 --> 02:30:52.935]  And it's got an American flag that's very triggering to her, saying InfoWars.com.
[02:30:53.536 --> 02:30:54.276]  So, there it is.
[02:30:55.417 --> 02:30:57.699]  It is on InfoWars.com.
[02:30:58.299 --> 02:31:00.921]  There's links to it on InfoWars.com.
[02:31:01.462 --> 02:31:02.422]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:02.523 --> 02:31:05.305]  Capitalist Walk Their Dog, Socialist Eat Them shirt.
[02:31:05.365 --> 02:31:15.892]  This is triggering, this is powerful, and it shows her with an enlarged cartoon head with giant ears looking like a dog foaming at the mouth because that's what she looks like is a dog on methamphetamine.
[02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:17.494]  She's probably on methamphetamine.
[02:31:17.514 --> 02:31:18.314]  I mean, what is she on?
[02:31:18.334 --> 02:31:19.135]  We should ask the question.
[02:31:19.155 --> 02:31:19.936]  She used to be good-looking.
[02:31:19.956 --> 02:31:21.837]  She's lost so much weight and has meth mouth.
[02:31:22.017 --> 02:31:24.499]  So you could call it the Alexandra Cortez meth mouth.
[02:31:24.639 --> 02:31:32.103]  Because she dares to threaten people with jail time and subpoenas if they make fun of the fact that capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[02:31:32.243 --> 02:31:35.325]  And she looks methed, you know, out of her brain now.
[02:31:35.385 --> 02:31:37.686]  Like she's flying on planet Pop-Tart.
[02:31:37.806 --> 02:31:40.048]  And so, hit the hottest shirt on the internet.
[02:31:40.068 --> 02:31:40.868]  We know it's gonna be the hottest.
[02:31:40.948 --> 02:31:43.750]  No reviews yet because we're just launching it in the last few days.
[02:31:43.930 --> 02:31:46.852]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:31:49.053 --> 02:31:50.013]  Listen, we need your support.
[02:31:50.053 --> 02:31:51.954]  We want these to blow off the shelf.
[02:31:52.094 --> 02:31:53.054]  I want to reorder them.
[02:31:53.114 --> 02:31:55.435]  We're going to have a slightly different design each time.
[02:31:55.455 --> 02:32:00.237]  I want to have 10 different limited editions shell out in the next six months of this.
[02:32:00.337 --> 02:32:04.339]  And I want this everywhere, because she's the new symbol of the Democratic Party.
[02:32:04.899 --> 02:32:08.340]  And it points out, capitalists walk their dogs, socialists eat them.
[02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:11.681]  And when people say, man, well, why are you showing her as a dog?
[02:32:11.921 --> 02:32:13.642]  Because, ladies and gentlemen, in the final
[02:32:13.922 --> 02:32:15.023]  Equation of communism.
[02:32:15.143 --> 02:32:17.404]  People eat people and are made lower than dogs.
[02:32:17.545 --> 02:32:21.828]  And she is a absolute tyrant wanting to arrest people that make fun of her.
[02:32:21.968 --> 02:32:25.710]  And so we're gonna show her how America works and throw it back in her face.
[02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:29.253]  Because she, her dancing a few years ago, she was good-looking and looked healthy.
[02:32:29.793 --> 02:32:30.874]  What drugs are she on?
[02:32:30.894 --> 02:32:31.895]  We need an intervention.
[02:32:32.255 --> 02:32:33.356]  What, methamphetamine?
[02:32:33.376 --> 02:32:35.277]  Or is it, is it Adderall?
[02:32:35.537 --> 02:32:36.458]  What is she snorting?
[02:32:36.798 --> 02:32:38.579]  We need to help Alexandra Cortez.
[02:32:38.759 --> 02:32:39.440]  Get the t-shirt.
[02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:40.561]  InfoWarsaw.com.
[02:32:40.681 --> 02:32:40.941]  Do it!
[02:33:06.287 --> 02:33:08.874]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:36.064 --> 02:33:43.210]  I want to get this population off world, figure out the secrets of the universe, and break through the Illuminati for real enlightenment.
[02:33:43.230 --> 02:33:48.795]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:49.175 --> 02:33:52.618]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:54.680 --> 02:33:55.521]  Here's the bottom line.
[02:33:55.561 --> 02:34:00.405]  Everybody knows this from lore, every culture, every ancient text says that there are
[02:34:01.826 --> 02:34:03.927]  Entities and creatures that can't be seen.
[02:34:04.207 --> 02:34:08.229]  Just like electricity can't be seen most of the time, or most forms of light.
[02:34:09.350 --> 02:34:12.311]  And they've proven dimensions below and above and other dimensions around that.
[02:34:14.432 --> 02:34:21.075]  And that these entities, most of the ones that will actually contact you, because see, God doesn't usually get involved unless you ask God in.
[02:34:21.115 --> 02:34:21.656]  God's free will.
[02:34:21.676 --> 02:34:22.636]  But these other ones, they don't.
[02:34:23.536 --> 02:34:24.017]  They're bad.
[02:34:25.677 --> 02:34:28.619]  And they'll give you knowledge and they'll give you power in a Faustian bargain.
[02:34:29.738 --> 02:34:31.078]  But they want your soul.
[02:34:31.858 --> 02:34:33.579]  That just means they want you to go with them.
[02:34:35.119 --> 02:34:39.760]  And these folks mean business.
[02:34:41.480 --> 02:34:53.203]  And if you look at how the globalists and all the top people who are being given power on this planet, they're all weak, pathetic, husk of who they were.
[02:34:55.083 --> 02:35:02.465]  Who are zombie-like, trying to carry out these operations, because at their levels, they're horrified, empty husk.
[02:35:04.725 --> 02:35:06.366]  And that's what's really, really sad about all this.
[02:35:06.386 --> 02:35:20.669]  You know, I was told by somebody that had dinner with Tim Cook a few weeks ago, that Tim Cook is a... I was talking to a person that's, you know, a billionaire, connected, and they said, yeah, Tim Cook, I was there with all these people, and Tim Cook just kept talking crap about you.
[02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:24.330]  And how you made fun of him being gay.
[02:35:25.390 --> 02:35:31.072]  Now imagine, in his weird world, he runs this trillion-dollar company with slave camps in China where they kill gay people.
[02:35:33.053 --> 02:35:35.773]  And he's not just on TV talking crap about me, how horrible I am.
[02:35:36.214 --> 02:35:38.894]  He's saying I'm anti-gay, and they said, well, what did he say?
[02:35:38.934 --> 02:35:43.456]  Well, he talked about me in China and said I was anti-gay for letting people get murdered because they're gay.
[02:35:44.076 --> 02:35:44.596]  See how that works?
[02:35:44.636 --> 02:35:45.837]  It was calling on his conscience.
[02:35:45.897 --> 02:35:48.378]  It wasn't that I said he was gay, which he admits he is.
[02:35:49.078 --> 02:35:52.459]  It's that I was calling him out as a fraud, and now he's using it as a shield.
[02:35:54.127 --> 02:35:55.368]  Think of how petty that is.
[02:35:56.888 --> 02:36:00.670]  These text messages got released, got leaked, on Jeff Bezos cheating on his wife.
[02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:05.892]  And he's in there bragging, going, oh yeah, baby, I'm powerful, I know Bono.
[02:36:06.412 --> 02:36:08.213]  Bono's been a total nerd for 30 years.
[02:36:08.633 --> 02:36:12.834]  He scams 99% of the money, literally, that he steals from Africans for aid money.
[02:36:14.275 --> 02:36:18.997]  But, you're like, how are these people so stupid and not powerful and not smart?
[02:36:19.337 --> 02:36:21.418]  Well, there's a group behind them that is smart.
[02:36:22.605 --> 02:36:24.646]  But it's totally, you never see them.
[02:36:25.246 --> 02:36:26.226]  They don't want any attention.
[02:36:27.027 --> 02:36:27.767]  They're behind the curtain.
[02:36:28.867 --> 02:36:31.628]  And they are carrying out a mission.
[02:36:31.668 --> 02:36:32.489]  They are soldiers.
[02:36:34.109 --> 02:36:39.951]  To turn the planet off, to teach you to hate yourself, to kill your life force, and to make you accept eternal death.
[02:36:41.092 --> 02:36:41.772]  They want your life.
[02:36:42.672 --> 02:36:43.413]  They want your soul.
[02:36:44.213 --> 02:36:45.053]  They want your children.
[02:36:45.934 --> 02:36:46.654]  They want to kill you.
[02:36:47.788 --> 02:36:48.308]  That's it.
[02:36:48.729 --> 02:36:50.370]  And now it's pretty obvious, isn't it?
[02:36:50.970 --> 02:36:58.314]  When they're at city council saying, we're gonna groom your kids, and we're gonna put them on drugs, and your little boys are gonna be ours!
[02:36:59.055 --> 02:37:00.295]  And you're not gonna stop us!
[02:37:03.337 --> 02:37:06.279]  And we're gonna have little boys in gay magazines posing naked with men!
[02:37:09.581 --> 02:37:11.082]  This is the takeover.
[02:37:11.642 --> 02:37:12.863]  The overthrow of reality.
[02:37:15.342 --> 02:37:17.266]  And so if you don't understand that, you understand nothing.
[02:37:17.727 --> 02:37:20.372]  Don't worry about losing your house or your life, folks.
[02:37:20.993 --> 02:37:23.679]  These people want your soul.
[02:37:26.428 --> 02:37:49.333]  And they want you to throw away men and women together, combining the genetic code and creating a new creature whose body is the composite of all those ancestors coming together in communion, whose DNA literally resonates as an antenna to higher dimensions through which we literally commune with God and our ancestors.
[02:37:50.626 --> 02:37:57.436]  Now the Bible, Christians groups say there is no such thing as ghosts, but then there's ghosts all throughout the Bible, with Saul and David and all of it.
[02:37:57.456 --> 02:37:58.277]  The point is, it's not that.
[02:37:58.337 --> 02:38:01.162]  It's like a hologram transmission of something that was already there.
[02:38:03.527 --> 02:38:13.313]  Like that's not Hollywood in the new Alien movie where, you know, they go in the thing and even though it's been thousands of years, they detonate this pulse and it sees where people were walking, you know, a thousand years before.
[02:38:13.774 --> 02:38:21.979]  It's basically that, but it's more than that because our ancestors that have gone on to higher levels then anticipated things and sent transmissions back.
[02:38:22.019 --> 02:38:23.140]  And the reason I know this is
[02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:26.761]  I've had dreams about the whole thing now, just in the last year.
[02:38:27.001 --> 02:38:29.242]  The whole thing diagrammed, how it all works.
[02:38:29.582 --> 02:38:30.162]  It's just incredible.
[02:38:30.462 --> 02:38:33.223]  Then I can go back into science, and I can see every level of that.
[02:38:33.343 --> 02:38:34.243]  But I'm going to go back to our guest.
[02:38:34.283 --> 02:38:36.624]  He'll join us again in the next few weeks for two hours, three hours.
[02:38:36.644 --> 02:38:39.865]  He can even host an hour by himself, if you'd like to, here on the show.
[02:38:40.545 --> 02:38:43.006]  But I'm going ahead and laying out all the cards here on the table, okay?
[02:38:43.046 --> 02:38:44.847]  I'm going to have it told you everything, folks.
[02:38:45.367 --> 02:38:48.650]  But, um, the occultists tried to recruit me early.
[02:38:49.030 --> 02:38:50.692]  I mean, like 12 years old, over and over again.
[02:38:50.712 --> 02:38:51.713]  It was like devil's advocate.
[02:38:51.973 --> 02:38:53.354]  Every time I turned around, they were trying to recruit me.
[02:38:53.695 --> 02:38:55.036]  And I don't mean some meth heads or something.
[02:38:55.056 --> 02:38:57.098]  I mean rich people, powerful people, you name it.
[02:38:57.478 --> 02:38:59.420]  Because they all know there's these abilities.
[02:38:59.740 --> 02:39:01.121]  They have little bitty abilities.
[02:39:01.141 --> 02:39:02.262]  I have huge abilities.
[02:39:02.402 --> 02:39:03.604]  A lot of you have giant abilities.
[02:39:04.184 --> 02:39:14.069]  And they're trying to see who's got it and recruit them because they want to understand how to be God at this level when you're already part of God and don't need to even do that.
[02:39:14.409 --> 02:39:15.489]  So, Jan, I've been ranting here.
[02:39:15.529 --> 02:39:19.431]  You go ahead and take over with whatever you want to get into.
[02:39:19.451 --> 02:39:23.313]  And when we go a little bit the next hour, I'll push our guest host Mike Adams back because I've been butting in.
[02:39:23.353 --> 02:39:24.854]  But this is about me, too.
[02:39:24.914 --> 02:39:25.654]  And this is about you.
[02:39:25.674 --> 02:39:27.275]  So that's why I'm sharing all this.
[02:39:27.355 --> 02:39:28.136]  It's really hardcore.
[02:39:29.236 --> 02:39:30.717]  Let me ask this question, you can cover whatever you want.
[02:39:31.357 --> 02:39:47.666]  From your experience, people need to know though how dangerous DMT in Ayahuasca is, and again, just at a temporal level, there's cults everywhere using this stuff now, and the media is hyping it so these cults get set up, and there's usually a globalist or corporate group behind protecting them.
[02:39:47.706 --> 02:39:54.450]  I mean, it's illegal to put a thousand or two thousand people a year, mainly wealthy people they target,
[02:39:56.343 --> 02:40:01.165]  On hallucinogenic, super hardcore drugs, and then do this inside the United States.
[02:40:01.525 --> 02:40:03.766]  This is being protected by the system.
[02:40:04.367 --> 02:40:11.449]  And just at a temporal, political level, there is an attempt to get the decision makers in every town in a cult.
[02:40:11.950 --> 02:40:16.291]  We're facing an occult, ayahuasca, DMT takeover.
[02:40:17.552 --> 02:40:22.174]  And people like Joe Rogan are the flashing sign on the hill saying it's a great thing.
[02:40:22.194 --> 02:40:22.774]  What do you say to that?
[02:40:23.976 --> 02:40:25.677]  Well, I absolutely agree with you.
[02:40:25.717 --> 02:40:28.920]  Let me just read a quote here and I just sent it to your producer.
[02:40:28.940 --> 02:40:38.227]  I don't know if she can show it on screen here, but psychedelic substances like ayahuasca create a state of hyper suggestibility in which persons are very open to being influenced by others.
[02:40:38.648 --> 02:40:47.675]  Many traditional cultures have utilized this condition to inculcate cultural values and behaviors in young people as they receive initiation into adulthood.
[02:40:48.115 --> 02:40:51.498]  In the West, countercultural values can be inculcated in young people
[02:40:52.262 --> 02:41:07.105]  When using these psychedelics, especially when using them in an antinomian context, and of course antinomian means of or relating to the view that Christians are released by grace from the obligation of observing the moral law.
[02:41:07.425 --> 02:41:09.246]  So this is exactly what they're doing.
[02:41:09.266 --> 02:41:12.246]  They're trying to get people away from observing the moral law.
[02:41:12.286 --> 02:41:19.788]  They want, you know, people to not even be able to tell the difference between boys and girls and all of this stuff, as you've exposed, as I've been exposing for years.
[02:41:20.688 --> 02:41:24.129]  You know, and even some of the artwork that you've shown on screen there by Alex Gray.
[02:41:24.149 --> 02:41:25.310]  You know, he's one of them too.
[02:41:25.350 --> 02:41:29.411]  He runs a big occult temple along the Hudson River in New York.
[02:41:29.871 --> 02:41:31.552]  But this is the agenda.
[02:41:31.652 --> 02:41:36.833]  It's to get people to think that, you know, the Bible and Christianity is ridiculous.
[02:41:36.853 --> 02:41:38.934]  That you shouldn't figure out what Logos is.
[02:41:39.234 --> 02:41:41.435]  You shouldn't figure out that truth is God.
[02:41:41.795 --> 02:41:44.416]  You should get into all of this moral relativism stuff.
[02:41:44.876 --> 02:41:48.598]  And, you know, all of these moral relativists actually think that they have the moral high ground.
[02:41:48.638 --> 02:42:01.443]  I had somebody just yesterday saying that, you know, women should have the right to, you know, there's been over 1.522 billion abortions since abortion was legalized worldwide.
[02:42:02.123 --> 02:42:13.347]  And, you know, they actually think that they have the moral high ground when they, when it's the largest genocide, it brings a whole new meaning to the term feminazi, but it's the largest genocide in human history.
[02:42:13.687 --> 02:42:27.211]  Stalin, Trotsky, Lenin, all of them don't even touch what the feminists have done with this genocide, but it's to get people hyper-suggestible, get them away from observing the moral law, understanding the difference between truth and lies.
[02:42:27.511 --> 02:42:29.431]  There you go, that's exactly it right there.
[02:42:29.471 --> 02:42:30.172]  Worldwide since 1980.
[02:42:32.773 --> 02:42:35.333]  1.522 billion abortions.
[02:42:35.393 --> 02:42:36.714]  Right there on screen, folks.
[02:42:36.774 --> 02:42:37.474]  This stuff is disgusting.
[02:42:37.494 --> 02:42:38.514]  I want to say something profound.
[02:42:38.854 --> 02:42:43.056]  For the humanity to make the jump level from this egg, then we'll create unlimited planets.
[02:42:44.116 --> 02:42:46.197]  We have to continue to have the replacement rate.
[02:42:46.657 --> 02:42:51.118]  We're being sabotaged right now and told, no, the way to save the Earth is kill the species.
[02:42:51.178 --> 02:42:54.139]  Now if that isn't an alien transmission, what is it?
[02:42:55.240 --> 02:42:56.800]  Oh yeah, they're always looking for signals from space.
[02:42:56.860 --> 02:42:58.161]  How about interdimensional signals?
[02:42:58.461 --> 02:42:59.061]  Oh, we're getting them.
[02:43:14.053 --> 02:43:25.767]  I recently saw a Gillette ad owned by Procter & Gamble that spent a minute and a half showing men as the enemy.
[02:43:26.367 --> 02:43:29.030]  That if a man tries to talk to a beautiful woman, he's a bad guy.
[02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:33.776]  Or if two kids get in a fight, somehow just men fighting, period, is evil.
[02:43:35.785 --> 02:43:48.830]  When you look at the Romans conquering civilizations where they would kill all the men, or you look at black slaves with the women being kept as the house service to suppress the men, you know that any authoritarian society seeking to dominate wants to suppress the men.
[02:43:50.130 --> 02:43:53.232]  Then you read the white papers, the Globos, that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:43:54.972 --> 02:44:04.936]  So men have now learned that this has happened, and there are chemicals added to the water, added to the food, trying to suppress their normal drive, their normal ethos, who they are.
[02:44:06.294 --> 02:44:12.197]  And that's why, online, herbs and supplements known to boost libido, stamina, and energy are such best sellers.
[02:44:12.217 --> 02:44:14.319]  That's why I'm getting into that market.
[02:44:15.559 --> 02:44:24.104]  Six, seven years ago, as a producer, I went out and found the most powerful formulas out there to not just give men, but also women, a boost.
[02:44:24.664 --> 02:44:26.986]  Super male, super female vitality.
[02:44:27.406 --> 02:44:32.549]  No one else produces a herbal formula that's cold-pressed and then aged.
[02:44:33.675 --> 02:44:36.417]  Like this group does in Utah.
[02:44:37.377 --> 02:44:42.480]  And they've had so much trouble getting the wild sourced herbs that I'm having to discontinue it.
[02:44:43.501 --> 02:44:46.263]  Now they've said maybe in a year, maybe in two, they can bring it back.
[02:44:46.323 --> 02:44:50.625]  But right now, this is the last run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:44:50.665 --> 02:44:51.146]  It's 50% off.
[02:44:51.246 --> 02:44:54.808]  Even though it's selling out, I want you to experience what God gave us.
[02:44:56.291 --> 02:44:56.852]  Through nature.
[02:44:56.912 --> 02:45:00.255]  But regardless, if you're depressed, go out and go for a hike.
[02:45:01.076 --> 02:45:04.599]  If you feel like you're a loser, you know, go out and help people at a soup kitchen.
[02:45:05.400 --> 02:45:08.603]  Because all the studies show, giving is better than receiving.
[02:45:09.443 --> 02:45:11.706]  You've given to us in incredible ways at InfoWars.
[02:45:11.726 --> 02:45:17.211]  You've supported us, you've been demonized for us, you've bought our products, and you've been fulfilled by it.
[02:45:17.251 --> 02:45:18.152]  You've seen great results.
[02:45:18.412 --> 02:45:19.333]  And I thank you for that.
[02:45:20.441 --> 02:45:24.324]  But when I bring out a product, I want to make sure it's the very best I can for you at the very best price.
[02:45:24.604 --> 02:45:29.047]  Because I appreciate what you're doing, and I believe in the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[02:45:30.027 --> 02:45:31.188]  So I salute you, I thank you.
[02:45:31.208 --> 02:45:39.534]  I just want to encourage you to get the last run in the foreseeable future, hopefully it comes back, of super male vitality and super female vitality.
[02:45:40.154 --> 02:45:46.959]  You know, it's funny, the price went up and up and up for it, and it is a great formula and a bestseller with 4,000 plus five-star reviews, but
[02:45:47.879 --> 02:45:53.982]  Well, for the last year, I couldn't get resupplied, and I said, I'm not going to buy it for the last six months, and now we're in discussions.
[02:45:54.022 --> 02:46:03.207]  Maybe the herbs can be gotten, and it is hard, but the point is, is that I'm giving you such a low price that what I'm selling it to you for becomes cost prohibitive to bring you something like this.
[02:46:03.787 --> 02:46:08.830]  We brought out powdered versions that are even stronger, but are powdered and organic, but not cold-pressed.
[02:46:09.210 --> 02:46:10.391]  People like them, but not as much.
[02:46:10.911 --> 02:46:13.813]  Because there's something about super male and super female voxelity.
[02:46:13.833 --> 02:46:18.958]  So get the last available bottles at EnforcedStore.com or call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:46:18.978 --> 02:46:21.760]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we're proud of these products.
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:23.181]  We're proud of what we've done.
[02:46:23.201 --> 02:46:25.103]  I know I'm under scrutiny.

[02:46:38.214 --> 02:46:39.515]  But without you, we won't be here.
[02:46:39.695 --> 02:46:46.842]  So, be part of history, get a t-shirt, get a book, get some of the supplements, and know you're funding the second American Revolution that's going worldwide.
[02:46:47.542 --> 02:46:52.106]  Super male and super female vitality, 50% off for a limited time at infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:52.226 --> 02:46:52.647]  Thank you all.
[02:47:06.284 --> 02:47:10.426]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:24.132 --> 02:47:29.255]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:40.046 --> 02:47:51.136]  I want to warn everyone listening all over the country.
[02:48:00.180 --> 02:48:05.142]  Satan, these interdimensional forces, the Bible tells us about right in plain view.
[02:48:05.202 --> 02:48:06.863]  It's all there on a planet in the middle of the universe.
[02:48:07.543 --> 02:48:11.665]  The Bible warns us it's all accurate, not the preacher's interpretations, like Christ said.
[02:48:13.385 --> 02:48:22.049]  And they've had holy hell, the Buddha fields here in Austin, where, oh, this guy would put you in between dimensions to talk to God, clearly giving people DMT.
[02:48:24.605 --> 02:48:25.507]  Oh, here, drink this.
[02:48:25.587 --> 02:48:26.629]  This is the water of life.
[02:48:26.689 --> 02:48:29.555]  And then, oh my gosh, now this guy's taking me there.
[02:48:29.615 --> 02:48:31.939]  Oh, think if you didn't know you were taking ayahuasca.
[02:48:32.701 --> 02:48:34.424]  Or you didn't know you were taking DMT.
[02:48:35.667 --> 02:48:36.007]  And then...
[02:48:37.873 --> 02:48:38.814]  What does everybody see?
[02:48:38.834 --> 02:48:43.038]  They see elves or goat creatures, even atheists.
[02:48:43.159 --> 02:48:53.089]  All these famous atheists go, yeah, I didn't believe in God, but then there was like floating Vishnu and goats and, and, and, but, but, but here's what happens.
[02:48:53.189 --> 02:48:56.993]  If they know beyond being a Christian, if you have God's Spirit, the Holy Spirit on you,
[02:48:58.954 --> 02:49:02.736]  If you take DMT, and I've talked to a lot of people that are just really loving, nice people.
[02:49:02.756 --> 02:49:04.317]  Their parents were Christians, they were baptized.
[02:49:04.337 --> 02:49:06.458]  They don't really know it's real, but they're really nice people.
[02:49:07.099 --> 02:49:10.621]  Nice people take DMT, like scientist types.
[02:49:10.661 --> 02:49:12.582]  He's nice, but you can tell he's very scientific.
[02:49:13.122 --> 02:49:15.563]  Jan Ervin here with us with Logos Media.
[02:49:15.783 --> 02:49:20.586]  He's all, well I saw checkered boards and the diagrams of the whole systems and the whatever it was.
[02:49:20.606 --> 02:49:22.647]  He saw kind of the mathematics of it.
[02:49:22.687 --> 02:49:23.568]  He's into mathematics.
[02:49:24.889 --> 02:49:25.790]  Let me tell you something, folks.
[02:49:25.930 --> 02:49:29.713]  I know a lot of people who became mentally ill after they took this.
[02:49:30.294 --> 02:49:32.536]  And this was around in the 80s and 90s.
[02:49:33.016 --> 02:49:36.139]  They would say, oh man, these guys are from the government.
[02:49:36.179 --> 02:49:37.540]  They've got some new synthetic stuff.
[02:49:37.960 --> 02:49:41.864]  They would describe, oh yeah, you ought to see all this cool-ass demons and stuff we see.
[02:49:42.144 --> 02:49:42.785]  You ought to take it.
[02:49:43.065 --> 02:49:44.506]  Here, take this yellow powder.
[02:49:44.526 --> 02:49:47.969]  When I'm like 15 years old, I'm like, no frickin' thanks.
[02:49:48.229 --> 02:49:48.730]  So here's the deal.
[02:49:50.168 --> 02:49:52.210]  They're testing all this on you right now.
[02:49:52.451 --> 02:49:58.358]  They've got 27% of the public on psychotropics that put you in a hallucination state, but without all the visuals.
[02:49:59.479 --> 02:50:00.600]  Very highly suggestible.
[02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:03.544]  That's why it says on the insert, can make you be homicidal and commit mass murder.
[02:50:03.784 --> 02:50:06.788]  And every mass shooter, every mass shooter has been on it.
[02:50:07.368 --> 02:50:07.749]  At schools.
[02:50:09.019 --> 02:50:10.180]  They all wear black trench coats.
[02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:11.261]  They all love the devil.
[02:50:11.301 --> 02:50:12.162]  They love Stalin.
[02:50:12.202 --> 02:50:12.943]  They love Hitler.
[02:50:13.323 --> 02:50:14.464]  They love shoot-em-up games.
[02:50:14.604 --> 02:50:19.008]  Now, the shoot-em-up games are bad, but it's a simulation for them who are in another world.
[02:50:19.048 --> 02:50:20.109]  They all have those eyes.
[02:50:21.330 --> 02:50:25.474]  That's not a thousand-yard stare from being in World War I or World War II.
[02:50:27.336 --> 02:50:30.339]  Being up three, four days, you know, off and on for years, fighting and killing.
[02:50:31.351 --> 02:50:37.580]  It's the thousand-yard stare from being over to the other side of oblivion, and somebody else is driving.
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:47.494]  You imagine the thrill of a lower-dimensional creature that sunk into a lower dimension because whatever planet or system they came from, they were hateful and bad, so they resonate to each other, like for like.
[02:50:47.975 --> 02:50:53.598]  Being able to jump in because you take these drugs or the TV mesmerizes you and get control of you like an avatar?
[02:50:54.099 --> 02:50:55.759]  Hollywood's telling you what it is.
[02:50:55.819 --> 02:50:56.460]  It's true.
[02:50:56.580 --> 02:50:57.140]  It's real.
[02:50:57.661 --> 02:51:01.403]  And they're jumping in and controlling you and taking you for a joyride.
[02:51:01.463 --> 02:51:05.665]  And what does a punk meth-head do, 15-year-old, that steals your Ferrari?
[02:51:06.025 --> 02:51:08.687]  When they're done, they crap in the front seat and run it off a cliff.
[02:51:09.753 --> 02:51:11.533]  So you get involved with these demons.
[02:51:12.234 --> 02:51:14.714]  They want to crap in your front seat and run you off a cliff.
[02:51:14.874 --> 02:51:15.754]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:51:15.974 --> 02:51:19.735]  You talk about existential envy of people for folks that are better looking or smarter than them.
[02:51:20.376 --> 02:51:30.618]  Humans are in the image of God so amazing, so powerful, that these demons have such hatred of us because we are whole levels better than them.
[02:51:31.892 --> 02:51:34.173]  And have the potential to go all the way up to God.
[02:51:34.754 --> 02:51:36.095]  And that's the big secret here today.
[02:51:36.755 --> 02:51:40.417]  And I'll get into more of it after Jan leaves us, but I'll give him the floor for this segment now and the next.
[02:51:40.838 --> 02:51:42.659]  And then I will tell you according to the globalists.
[02:51:42.739 --> 02:51:43.199]  Not me.
[02:51:43.640 --> 02:51:46.001]  But notice when I say this, you think it'd be so discrediting.
[02:51:46.501 --> 02:51:47.402]  The media would pick this up.
[02:51:47.462 --> 02:51:49.003]  They'd keep their mouths zipped.
[02:51:49.643 --> 02:51:50.964]  Because I'm giving you the big secrets.
[02:51:50.984 --> 02:51:53.526]  They'd go, oh, Jones says there's slave colonies on Mars.
[02:51:54.166 --> 02:51:54.707]  Never said that.
[02:51:55.507 --> 02:51:59.669]  They don't say Jones says all this because they are freaked out.
[02:52:00.090 --> 02:52:05.172]  Tim Cook's like, how does he know I'm on synthetic Zyklon's level model molecule whatever?
[02:52:05.693 --> 02:52:07.013]  Because I know, dumbass!
[02:52:07.634 --> 02:52:08.294]  I know all about it!
[02:52:09.175 --> 02:52:11.616]  I temporarily know and then I also interdimensionally know.
[02:52:12.476 --> 02:52:16.299]  Show, getting back to Jan Ervin with LogosMedia.com.
[02:52:16.399 --> 02:52:16.899]  Please continue.
[02:52:18.112 --> 02:52:28.059]  All right, well, you know, I wanted to dive in here for a minute into some of the CIA rock bands that came out of the 60s and 70s, like the Grateful Dead, Full-On CIA.
[02:52:28.099 --> 02:52:31.061]  I've got Bob Weir admitting that they're CIA.
[02:52:31.101 --> 02:52:32.923]  They're at Bohemian Grove, etc.
[02:52:33.183 --> 02:52:38.166]  A number of the members, but, you know, it's Uncle Sam playing in a rock and roll band.
[02:52:38.186 --> 02:52:40.248]  The Doors tied into it, you know.
[02:52:40.948 --> 02:52:42.710]  Dave McGowan and I did some shows on this.
[02:52:42.730 --> 02:52:44.131]  Oh, the Doors admitted that they were a
[02:52:44.551 --> 02:52:48.307]  It's a mass riot CIA mind control operation and so why do they kill everybody at 27?
[02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:51.281]  You know, I don't know about that.
[02:52:51.321 --> 02:52:56.905]  You know, either that or they just fake their deaths and go on to another, you know, another project.
[02:52:57.005 --> 02:53:02.389]  But, you know, most of the bands out of the psychedelic 60s were CIA.
[02:53:02.429 --> 02:53:09.775]  I recommend people looking up my series with Dr. Hans Utter, Music, Mind Control, and Psychobiology on my YouTube channel.
[02:53:09.795 --> 02:53:11.636]  There's a whole playlist there of all of this.
[02:53:12.056 --> 02:53:18.982]  But full-on CIA, you got, you know, guys like, oh shoot, now I'm forgetting his name.
[02:53:20.445 --> 02:53:22.228]  Anyway, the whole band of them.
[02:53:22.268 --> 02:53:30.458]  But, you know, he's out there promoting gun control and all this stuff with these... Charlie Madsen was an LSD pusher for the CIA.
[02:53:32.021 --> 02:53:40.747]  Yeah, and I actually have him in my database as well, but oh shoot now You know John Perry Barlow that ran the Electronic Freedom Foundation.
[02:53:40.767 --> 02:53:45.231]  He was a songwriter for the CIA He was you know or for the Grateful Dead.
[02:53:45.271 --> 02:53:59.021]  He was working with them The Merry Pranksters CIA they actually had a number of buses running around the country it wasn't just one of them even you know the Millbrook mansion where Tim Leary and
[02:54:00.479 --> 02:54:02.940]  Let's get into John Lennon, before John Lennon died.
[02:54:23.528 --> 02:54:24.889]  Yeah, he's another bad one.
[02:54:25.209 --> 02:54:29.652]  John Lennon was definitely CIA and MI6 as far as I can tell.
[02:54:54.648 --> 02:54:58.709]  Yeah, you know, there was a clip of him coming out and exposing some of this.
[02:54:59.330 --> 02:55:01.050]  I don't know how sincere it was.
[02:55:01.250 --> 02:55:05.631]  I don't know if he's one of these rock megastars that faked their death or not.
[02:55:05.751 --> 02:55:07.692]  No, I don't think he faked his death.
[02:55:08.612 --> 02:55:13.333]  But what I'm saying is, he said the globalists want to reduce the population, it's all a lie.
[02:55:13.953 --> 02:55:16.034]  I think John Lennon's the one that got away.
[02:55:17.475 --> 02:55:18.096]  You think so?
[02:55:18.456 --> 02:55:19.978]  Uh, you know, I don't know.
[02:55:19.998 --> 02:55:22.120]  I mean, we could definitely look at them, uh, more.
[02:55:22.160 --> 02:55:23.442]  I've, I'm just pulling out my database here.
[02:55:23.462 --> 02:55:23.982]  Well, let me ask you this.
[02:55:24.022 --> 02:55:29.128]  Why would his family call me and tell me all that?
[02:55:29.949 --> 02:55:30.330]  I don't know.
[02:55:30.570 --> 02:55:32.672]  I mean, I, I didn't hear the conversation, so.
[02:55:32.692 --> 02:55:33.193]  Well, I'm telling you.
[02:55:33.213 --> 02:55:36.557]  You know, you, you know, you don't think I, you know, you don't think I make stuff up, do you?
[02:55:37.538 --> 02:55:40.701]  I'm not saying you are, but you know, I do know the Beatles were S.R.I.
[02:55:40.761 --> 02:55:42.162]  and Tavistock Operation.
[02:55:42.202 --> 02:55:43.383]  They were part of the Changing Images project.
[02:55:43.403 --> 02:55:44.304]  You know what I just said?
[02:55:44.324 --> 02:55:45.245]  I said one that got away.
[02:55:45.385 --> 02:55:47.927]  No, no, I mean, Solitarstas was a horrible guy.
[02:55:47.947 --> 02:55:49.549]  Some of them do get away, definitely.
[02:55:49.569 --> 02:55:50.089]  Some of them do wake up.
[02:55:50.129 --> 02:55:51.130]  No, I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:55:51.170 --> 02:55:51.610]  I totally agree.
[02:55:51.630 --> 02:55:52.531]  That's why I brought the Beatles up.
[02:55:52.892 --> 02:56:00.118]  I'm saying, some of these people get away, and it's never too late, like the whole Faustian thing, for people to realize that they can get out of this.
[02:56:00.558 --> 02:56:01.219]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:56:01.619 --> 02:56:07.200]  Well, it's like what's-his-name Kanye West woke up recently and they locked him up and whatnot.
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:10.521]  Now he's a Christian and he's totally woke to what's going on.
[02:56:10.561 --> 02:56:14.762]  But, you know, here's the ironic thing, and I'm sure you've experienced this too, Alex.
[02:56:15.182 --> 02:56:21.564]  The people who haven't read the Bible, and especially the New Testament, think that they're the most educated about what it says.
[02:56:21.624 --> 02:56:22.744]  And rather than thinking that
[02:56:23.184 --> 02:56:24.765]  All of us who have read it are stupid.
[02:56:24.825 --> 02:56:29.188]  I recommend people drop the ignorance and go out and sit down.
[02:56:29.508 --> 02:56:31.330]  It's only 400, 410 pages.
[02:56:31.370 --> 02:56:32.971]  But it's like a decoder ring, though.
[02:56:33.111 --> 02:56:35.192]  If you don't understand this stuff... It is.
[02:56:35.212 --> 02:56:36.073]  So is the Trivium.
[02:56:36.853 --> 02:56:37.514]  You don't see it.
[02:56:37.914 --> 02:56:40.496]  I mean, once you know it, you're like, wow!
[02:56:41.036 --> 02:56:42.777]  That's why they don't want us to read it.
[02:56:42.837 --> 02:56:44.758]  That's why they attack the Bible constantly.
[02:56:44.798 --> 02:56:49.521]  They do not want us to read it, because once you read it, you see all the stuff going on and you're going to be woke.
[02:56:49.541 --> 02:56:56.186]  Because these were truly woke people that had been through it, and God isn't going to put us into a free will universe, but he gives us a cheat sheet.
[02:56:56.466 --> 02:56:58.587]  We're his children, but he gives us a cheat sheet.
[02:56:58.627 --> 02:57:01.489]  He goes, you have free will, but kids, here's a cheat sheet.
[02:57:02.609 --> 02:57:03.389]  Absolutely right.
[02:57:03.609 --> 02:57:04.450]  Absolutely correct.
[02:57:04.630 --> 02:57:07.110]  And, you know, the Bible is essentially your owner's manual.
[02:57:07.190 --> 02:57:08.271]  Everybody got a copy.
[02:57:08.871 --> 02:57:09.231]  Read it.
[02:57:09.431 --> 02:57:12.772]  Read the thing, and don't pretend that you're smarter than everybody else, and we're all just stupid.
[02:57:12.792 --> 02:57:20.494]  And by the way, it's so advanced that if you read a real King James Version, and that's not even perfect, you immediately, like, start going into a trance, even if you don't believe it.
[02:57:20.854 --> 02:57:22.394]  This has to do with atheists, everybody.
[02:57:22.414 --> 02:57:26.916]  You start, like, if you really read it, and then you're looking for God, you will then see what it's really saying.
[02:57:27.536 --> 02:57:30.297]  I've seen it convert a lot of atheists to truth real fast.
[02:57:30.877 --> 02:57:31.677]  Truth is God.
[02:57:32.708 --> 02:57:33.088]  That's right.
[02:57:33.128 --> 02:57:33.829]  God is truth.
[02:57:33.889 --> 02:57:34.789]  We'll be right back.

[02:58:54.545 --> 02:58:55.726]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:58:56.266 --> 02:58:57.347]  Defeat the pedophiles.

[02:59:04.731 --> 02:59:07.953]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:59:08.533 --> 02:59:16.598]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:59:17.518 --> 02:59:26.900]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:59:27.581 --> 02:59:31.482]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[02:59:31.542 --> 02:59:37.443]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[02:59:37.503 --> 02:59:40.304]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[02:59:40.524 --> 02:59:41.764]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:59:42.024 --> 02:59:45.065]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[02:59:47.233 --> 02:59:51.896]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[02:59:53.937 --> 02:59:59.661]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:14.306 --> 03:00:18.989]  They hate you.
[03:00:19.149 --> 03:00:20.910]  I love you!
[03:00:21.010 --> 03:00:36.900]  You know, I talked to some family in Vietnam where they ordered them to put the helicopter pilots on LSD and then fly missions over Cambodia.
[03:00:40.082 --> 03:00:42.063]  That's just one little snapshot from my life.
[03:00:43.390 --> 03:00:48.773]  And then you add this to all the things we're talking about here and how crazy this is.
[03:00:48.873 --> 03:00:49.393]  It's amazing.
[03:00:50.394 --> 03:00:57.998]  I'm going to very briefly at the start of the next segment tell you the total endgame from what the globalists themselves are saying that I've reverse engineered it.
[03:00:58.478 --> 03:00:58.958]  It's happening.
[03:01:00.419 --> 03:01:03.660]  So whatever, whatever really is going on, it doesn't matter.
[03:01:03.700 --> 03:01:04.621]  The endgame is the same.
[03:01:05.181 --> 03:01:07.302]  This is like the mystery of the universe type stuff.
[03:01:07.342 --> 03:01:10.124]  It's not the final mystery, but this is the heavy.
[03:01:10.684 --> 03:01:12.025]  This is why they don't want this show out there.
[03:01:12.827 --> 03:01:14.748]  That's why they're not going to attack us for what we said today.
[03:01:14.788 --> 03:01:15.928]  They don't touch this.
[03:01:16.529 --> 03:01:24.012]  How discrediting is it to talk about Jones says, you know, all these interdimensional things are happening and people see elves because this is their religion, bro.
[03:01:26.173 --> 03:01:31.815]  You get a bunch of believers together in a real church that looking for God and justice and what does God want to do is to help humanity.
[03:01:32.195 --> 03:01:36.597]  You get incredible power, but it's for humanity.
[03:01:37.418 --> 03:01:39.659]  Other people said, no, I want this over other folks.
[03:01:40.498 --> 03:01:42.620]  I don't want other people around me to have this discernment too.
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:44.802]  I want the enlightenment, no one else!
[03:01:46.103 --> 03:01:47.784]  Then you're given the knowledge of evil.
[03:01:47.804 --> 03:01:49.986]  You already have the knowledge of good.
[03:01:50.986 --> 03:01:52.107]  The knowledge of evil.
[03:01:53.508 --> 03:02:00.354]  A viral system in the universe of predatory behavior, but it only lowers civilizations into collapse.
[03:02:00.914 --> 03:02:08.861]  It doesn't go upwards into that intergalactic waterfall, that light beam into the higher dimensions, into God and the great white throne room.
[03:02:10.390 --> 03:02:12.714]  The devil stands at the gate to that, trying to block us.
[03:02:12.954 --> 03:02:13.635]  Three minutes left.
[03:02:13.795 --> 03:02:15.878]  Jan Ervin, very impressive.
[03:02:15.898 --> 03:02:16.459]  LogosMedia.com.
[03:02:16.479 --> 03:02:17.240]  We'll have you back soon.
[03:02:17.501 --> 03:02:18.142]  Closing comments.
[03:02:19.093 --> 03:02:23.835]  You know, I really appreciate you, Alex, helping me expose the left-hand path today.
[03:02:23.875 --> 03:02:28.957]  That's very important that people grasp what the left and the left-hand path is, that it's Satanism.
[03:02:29.518 --> 03:02:32.039]  Again, people need to read their Bible.
[03:02:32.119 --> 03:02:39.062]  Don't think that you know what it says because you haven't read it and you think we're all just idiots or, you know, conservative Christian freaks or whatnot.
[03:02:39.422 --> 03:02:41.283]  It exposes how the operation works.
[03:02:41.323 --> 03:02:43.264]  There's a reason why we all got a copy of it.
[03:02:43.904 --> 03:02:49.790]  And, you know, people check out the LogosMedia.com website, check out my YouTube channel while it's still there.
[03:02:50.230 --> 03:02:55.194]  I recommend people download everything because who knows, they may shut down my channel after today.
[03:02:56.095 --> 03:03:01.039]  If I know that they shut you down, I'll try to get this show up on my channel this week as soon as I get it.
[03:03:01.079 --> 03:03:02.080]  Oh, it's funny you say that.
[03:03:02.901 --> 03:03:04.803]  Talking about Tim Cook, I got banned off stuff.
[03:03:04.923 --> 03:03:07.825]  It's like, you talk about Rogan, you're banned everywhere.
[03:03:08.086 --> 03:03:09.707]  They think this is their weapon.
[03:03:12.899 --> 03:03:14.040]  Absolutely right, Alex.
[03:03:14.661 --> 03:03:16.582]  So, you know, there's a whole lot more.
[03:03:16.662 --> 03:03:21.907]  You know, Alan Watts, Joseph Campbell, Ken Kesey, Alistair Crowley, Carlos Castaneda.
[03:03:22.007 --> 03:03:23.248]  All these guys were in on it.
[03:03:23.388 --> 03:03:26.231]  Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, etc.
[03:03:26.631 --> 03:03:28.933]  All of these guys were in on MKUltra.
[03:03:30.549 --> 03:03:37.451]  You know, people need to wake up that their psychedelic heroes and the heroes of the 60s were the real central MKUltra program.
[03:03:37.491 --> 03:03:41.592]  The whole Manchurian Candidate thing was a limited hangout, a diversion.
[03:03:41.612 --> 03:03:46.613]  And have you not found, too, at the end of the day, it's all about vampirism, feeding on children's innocence?
[03:03:46.653 --> 03:03:48.274]  Petivore is exactly right.
[03:03:48.314 --> 03:03:50.675]  Adrenochrome, that's what's at the top of this stuff.
[03:03:51.075 --> 03:03:55.636]  But, you know, we've been trying to expose this stuff for about eight years now, since I woke up.
[03:03:55.976 --> 03:03:57.600]  Let me ask you this in closing.
[03:03:57.761 --> 03:03:59.184]  Why are they fighting so hard?
[03:03:59.224 --> 03:04:01.149]  Is this their offensive to overthrow reality?
[03:04:01.490 --> 03:04:04.297]  Or is their offensive got backed off and this is their counter offensive?
[03:04:05.569 --> 03:04:07.871]  I think it's their offensive to overthrow reality.
[03:04:07.931 --> 03:04:15.096]  I think since I started exposing a lot of this stuff eight years ago, they ramped it up trying to, you know, shut this down.
[03:04:15.136 --> 03:04:19.560]  They ramped up Rogan and the rest of these people to promote psychedelics as heavily as they could.
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:24.904]  The Esalen Institute, MAPS, Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, etc.
[03:04:25.364 --> 03:04:31.048]  All of that stuff, they're all front organizations working for the CIA, in my opinion, as far as my research.
[03:04:31.068 --> 03:04:32.530]  Well, that's on record, but I want to be clear.
[03:04:32.550 --> 03:04:33.871]  We're not judging anyone that's
[03:04:34.591 --> 03:04:35.271]  Had an abortion.
[03:04:35.291 --> 03:04:38.433]  We're not judging anyone who's done the human sacrifice, like I have.
[03:04:38.793 --> 03:04:40.213]  We're not judging anyone that's taken these.
[03:04:40.233 --> 03:04:41.714]  We're not saying overall that's bad.
[03:04:41.874 --> 03:04:42.214]  I'm not.
[03:04:42.614 --> 03:04:50.537]  I'm saying under these people's tutelage and these cults, the last place you want to take a hallucinogen, I say you shouldn't take it, is with some damn cult that says... Do not.
[03:04:50.557 --> 03:04:51.998]  Go ahead, what?
[03:04:52.658 --> 03:04:53.458]  Do not take them.
[03:04:53.878 --> 03:04:54.459]  Do not take them.
[03:04:54.479 --> 03:04:55.019]  Do not take them.
[03:04:55.379 --> 03:04:57.680]  All right, Jan Ervin, thank you so much.
[03:04:57.700 --> 03:04:58.560]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[03:04:58.860 --> 03:04:59.740]  Localsmedia.com.
[03:05:00.061 --> 03:05:00.481]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.501 --> 03:05:00.821]  We'll be back.
[03:05:04.603 --> 03:05:05.103]  Here's the thing.
[03:05:05.123 --> 03:05:06.564]  I know how metaphysics works.
[03:05:06.644 --> 03:05:07.785]  I know how the universe works.
[03:05:08.466 --> 03:05:10.527]  I know how the cow ate the cabbage.
[03:05:11.728 --> 03:05:15.330]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:05:16.270 --> 03:05:19.492]  I can go on air and tell people that InfoWars could shut down.
[03:05:20.713 --> 03:05:22.074]  And that would be a very true statement.
[03:05:22.914 --> 03:05:29.098]  If I don't have the will, InfoWars could shut down tomorrow.
[03:05:30.139 --> 03:05:31.620]  If I fight as hard as I can,
[03:05:33.377 --> 03:05:35.058]  And people don't support us, we shut down in a year.
[03:05:36.539 --> 03:05:39.261]  You support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:05:39.682 --> 03:05:41.643]  We won't just be here 100 years, we'll be here forever.
[03:05:42.023 --> 03:05:43.144]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:05:44.305 --> 03:05:52.511]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are gonna look back and say, you know, we struggled here, we made it.
[03:05:52.911 --> 03:05:57.094]  Unlike all these other test cases that God put in place, you know, there's a lot of eggs.
[03:05:57.655 --> 03:06:00.417]  We're proud of what we brought you and the whole family of InfoWars products.
[03:06:00.857 --> 03:06:01.998]  Without you, we won't be here.
[03:06:14.772 --> 03:06:18.093]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:18.833 --> 03:06:20.654]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:22.594 --> 03:06:33.218]  We've now moved on from the two-year fake Russia hoax, the wish hunt, where it goes into an inquisition and they start persecuting everybody and overturning the 2016 election.
[03:06:35.410 --> 03:06:50.799]  Because we've been this persecuted and this targeted and set up as a straw man for the entire fall of America, the takedown of the president, and our republic itself, literally, we are in the eye of the hurricane and are able to see things and know things others don't.
[03:06:51.319 --> 03:06:53.300]  In fact, I'm not scared of Robert Mueller III.
[03:06:53.320 --> 03:06:57.482]  I'm not scared of all these white shoe boy lawyers and wannabe tough guys, okay?
[03:06:57.983 --> 03:07:03.166]  I know I've been put in this place by God, and thanks to your support and prayers, to now face this test.
[03:07:03.906 --> 03:07:06.409]  I fear for our children and the country and the world.
[03:07:07.391 --> 03:07:15.962]  This spirit of fear and this spirit of bullying from the left and the deep state and the rogue state and the globalists is permeating this country.
[03:07:16.542 --> 03:07:19.947]  This is a group of criminals and we will defeat these terrorists.
[03:07:34.434 --> 03:07:34.755]  Yeah.
[03:07:43.824 --> 03:07:44.084]  All right.
[03:07:44.164 --> 03:07:49.266]  I just did three hours and seven minutes of radio and never plugged a product or a service once.
[03:07:49.366 --> 03:07:53.767]  No one in their right mind would ever do that if they want to keep their company on radio or TV afloat.
[03:07:53.847 --> 03:07:56.328]  But I get so obsessed with the news, I don't do it.
[03:07:56.428 --> 03:08:01.750]  And now I can't even find the new product ad that I actually been so busy.
[03:08:01.790 --> 03:08:02.570]  I wrote this morning.
[03:08:02.590 --> 03:08:04.611]  You know, this product's two years in development.
[03:08:05.091 --> 03:08:06.671]  That's how much we put into what we bring you.
[03:08:07.572 --> 03:08:08.672]  And then I'm so busy.
[03:08:08.712 --> 03:08:09.712]  Well, I already know it's the best.
[03:08:10.093 --> 03:08:11.213]  I spend no time promoting.
[03:08:12.537 --> 03:08:19.142]  Everybody else puts, you know, a dollar or two in the supplement, and then they put all the money into marketing and profit.
[03:08:19.163 --> 03:08:19.723]  We don't even do that.
[03:08:19.743 --> 03:08:23.686]  Will you guys reprint me the new ad that I actually wrote?
[03:08:24.347 --> 03:08:30.252]  Because the ad they wrote this morning, or they gave me a few days ago, isn't hardcore about what it's really doing.
[03:08:30.272 --> 03:08:30.832]  I'm not bitching.
[03:08:30.852 --> 03:08:35.016]  I'm just saying, okay, here it is.
[03:08:35.056 --> 03:08:35.696]  Thank you very much.
[03:08:36.277 --> 03:08:37.578]  So let me just do this right now.
[03:08:39.158 --> 03:08:40.479]  Now, did you hear what I just said?
[03:08:41.199 --> 03:08:42.419]  Mike Adams is taking over next segment.
[03:08:44.100 --> 03:08:58.506]  We've spent two years and had to pay top formulators and scientists from the top labs in the country to make what they believed was the best energy drink replacement
[03:08:59.940 --> 03:09:01.640]  Because energy drinks are bad, on average.
[03:09:02.661 --> 03:09:08.282]  And, of course, we had to sign contracts that we can't say who they are, because you sure as hell can't be associated with the big evil Alex Jones.
[03:09:09.563 --> 03:09:24.187]  So we had the top, the top formulator, and the top natural health guru that advises the Olympic Committee, the NFL, you name it, that'll pay him a lot of money, too.
[03:09:24.207 --> 03:09:27.888]  And then we had other groups go double-checking, because I said,
[03:09:29.022 --> 03:09:44.712]  If the average energy drink has 30 cents of product that's actually energy and a bunch of sugar and crap and no minerals or vitamins, I said, what would happen if we sold something for 50 bucks and it had $20 of product in it?
[03:09:45.492 --> 03:09:47.274]  And they said, that's not even done.
[03:09:47.334 --> 03:09:48.134]  That's impossible.
[03:09:49.315 --> 03:09:50.816]  It's just not, it's not done.
[03:09:51.116 --> 03:09:52.957]  So you have to understand how my brain works.
[03:09:53.017 --> 03:09:55.459]  How, how, how, how I operate.
[03:09:56.380 --> 03:09:57.361]  That's how I operate.
[03:09:57.401 --> 03:10:00.683]  That's how I do all the things I do.
[03:10:01.664 --> 03:10:03.425]  Is that I'm a game changer.
[03:10:03.445 --> 03:10:04.445]  And I'm not just saying that.
[03:10:05.566 --> 03:10:07.548]  You get next decade's news today.
[03:10:07.768 --> 03:10:10.469]  We change the world because other people aren't willing to do it.
[03:10:11.870 --> 03:10:13.892]  It's not that I'm that smart.
[03:10:15.693 --> 03:10:19.035]  It's that we're willing to actually go out and study what's really going on.
[03:10:19.155 --> 03:10:19.355]  So.
[03:10:22.738 --> 03:10:23.938]  Two years of preparation.
[03:10:24.519 --> 03:10:26.020]  No preparation to promote it.
[03:10:27.225 --> 03:10:29.647]  See, you're not paying for the promotion.
[03:10:29.747 --> 03:10:31.008]  You're paying for the preparation.
[03:10:31.589 --> 03:10:32.950]  And you're paying to fund this operation.
[03:10:33.250 --> 03:10:46.441]  If I was just solid saying, donate to us, look at the payoff, the defeat of the globalists, the global victories, the relaunch, we are recognized by the enemy, internally and publicly, as the zenith, the detonator, the heart
[03:10:48.459 --> 03:10:53.242]  Patient zero of the disease that Brian Stelter calls the populist global awakening.
[03:10:53.462 --> 03:10:54.743]  Well, it's not me, it's you.
[03:10:55.724 --> 03:11:00.127]  Activist, loving, good people of every race, color, and creed that care about justice and truth.
[03:11:01.688 --> 03:11:12.595]  So, I said I want the strongest, most powerful, cleanest, healthiest system with all of the key upload enzymes in it.
[03:11:14.878 --> 03:11:29.151]  Because the body, it doesn't matter how much energy drink you drink after a while, it depletes vitamins and minerals and cofactors and key chemicals that are needed to actually get it through the blood, through the blood-brain barrier, and to the cells.
[03:11:30.925 --> 03:11:32.506]  In a healthy way without the crash.
[03:11:33.086 --> 03:11:35.888]  So imagine if there was an energy drink without the crash.
[03:11:36.409 --> 03:11:40.611]  Imagine if there was an energy drink without the toxicity and the sugar and all the garbage.
[03:11:41.031 --> 03:11:49.097]  Imagine if there was an energy drink that actually had everything that was really a vitamin and mineral fusion with everything else.
[03:11:49.137 --> 03:11:50.417]  Well, we've done it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:11:51.798 --> 03:11:55.961]  And I'll tell you right now that it is next level.
[03:11:58.820 --> 03:12:01.221]  Two years in the making, turbo force.
[03:12:04.443 --> 03:12:15.188]  Energy, the entire metabolism, alertness, and then when you read on the box, document cam shot please, that's B-roll too, I think, we shot it days ago, who knows?
[03:12:16.349 --> 03:12:25.213]  And if you look at the back of the box, it goes into everything it's got, ladies and gentlemen, and it's got everything in there.
[03:12:27.219 --> 03:12:43.243]  And it's got the herbal energy blend that are all these different types of naturally occurring systems within chemicals that are naturally occurring in the plants to help upload it naturally.
[03:12:44.503 --> 03:12:45.103]  And it's all there.
[03:12:45.843 --> 03:12:49.624]  This is someone going to a bunch of top research.
[03:12:49.664 --> 03:12:54.045]  We went to four different groups and saying, give us your plan of the
[03:12:55.629 --> 03:13:01.194]  Next level muscle car in natural, healthy energy.
[03:13:03.396 --> 03:13:08.481]  And again, Brain Force Plus is mainly a nootropic with a little bit of clean energy.
[03:13:08.902 --> 03:13:09.522]  People love it.
[03:13:11.224 --> 03:13:17.149]  This is pre-workout, ultimate pre-workout, but ultimate start your day or take in the middle of the day.
[03:13:18.175 --> 03:13:21.317]  I quite frankly, BrainForce works so good on me, I can barely take it.
[03:13:21.337 --> 03:13:25.980]  But I need to stay up all night, because it goes down, pop one at 10 o'clock at night, I'm good at midnight, I'm up all night.
[03:13:26.920 --> 03:13:28.761]  And then I go to sleep and don't crash from it the next day.
[03:13:31.423 --> 03:13:36.726]  So this complements BrainForce Plus, but this is a packet form.
[03:13:38.327 --> 03:13:45.011]  And quite frankly, I said make it one of the strongest out there on the market, but make it clean and make it good.
[03:13:46.201 --> 03:13:49.825]  Most people, I would suggest you take a quarter packet the first time you take it.
[03:13:50.906 --> 03:13:59.174]  Because when we got prototypes of this a few months ago in, everyone was bouncing off the walls and we can't even believe this is legal.
[03:14:01.576 --> 03:14:04.219]  Bouncing off the walls.
[03:14:05.626 --> 03:14:10.249]  Because it has a spectrum of every natural form of caffeine there is.
[03:14:10.990 --> 03:14:16.453]  But stuff that has a 4-hour burn rate, a 3-hour burn rate, a 2-hour burn rate, a 1-hour burn rate.
[03:14:17.394 --> 03:14:23.078]  It's got all of these different enzymes that upload it, so you get a way bigger response.
[03:14:26.440 --> 03:14:27.200]  I think this is good.
[03:14:27.721 --> 03:14:30.763]  And I'm proud of it, and you'll use it responsibly.
[03:14:34.258 --> 03:14:41.064]  I said, give us the most powerful, clean, healthy thing, but in this genre, and I cannot believe we even produced this.
[03:14:41.164 --> 03:14:44.106]  I mean, this, this, this is insane.
[03:14:46.228 --> 03:14:47.489]  Turbo force, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:14:49.251 --> 03:14:53.775]  You put, I mean, I think you should put a half in your water first.
[03:14:56.117 --> 03:14:58.539]  Why don't you get up in the morning and try this instead of your coffee?
[03:15:01.032 --> 03:15:21.661]  Because a lot of people are so depleted of all these vitamins and minerals and also cofactors and these enzymes that upload it, that when you've got everything that carries it, and it's not just caffeine, it's got other stuff that's natural, healthy, pick-me-ups in there, it's hard to even get into why this is so good because there's so many ingredients.
[03:15:22.661 --> 03:15:24.722]  I mean, there's just a ton of ingredients in this baby.
[03:15:25.723 --> 03:15:26.523]  A ton of ingredients.
[03:15:26.543 --> 03:15:27.703]  This took two years to develop.
[03:15:33.140 --> 03:15:34.221]  It's to the moon without a rocket.
[03:15:34.782 --> 03:15:42.687]  So, get your first run of TurboForce 33% off at Infowarsstore.com or AAA2533139.
[03:15:43.087 --> 03:15:45.689]  TurboForce, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:48.030]  Guess they're putting the 10-pack on screen.
[03:15:49.291 --> 03:15:51.533]  Might want to put the single pack up there on screen for folks.
[03:15:52.093 --> 03:15:54.435]  Or people with glasses will think it costs $399.
[03:15:54.555 --> 03:15:55.355]  It does not.
[03:15:55.736 --> 03:15:57.397]  No reviews yet.
[03:15:57.757 --> 03:15:57.397]  $39.95.
[03:15:58.097 --> 03:15:59.558]  Blows away everything on the planet.
[03:15:59.658 --> 03:16:00.679]  This is the ultimate.
[03:16:07.105 --> 03:16:19.080]  Conservatively, there have been several thousand articles written in the last three years demonizing InfoWars, and yours truly, for selling high-quality supplements.
[03:16:20.259 --> 03:16:38.743]  In fact, even the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, that owns the biggest sellers of supplements in the world, even that organization has written hit pieces claiming I'm a fraud and selling snake oil when they're owned by a man who owns Amazon and Whole Foods.
[03:16:40.403 --> 03:16:42.443]  Amazon was the number one supplement seller in the world.
[03:16:42.824 --> 03:16:43.684]  Whole Foods was number two.
[03:16:44.524 --> 03:16:49.845]  He owns the number one and number two biggest supplement sellers on the planet.
[03:16:51.434 --> 03:16:57.700]  And then his publication, a weaponized disinformation op, says I'm bad and should be shut down.
[03:16:58.981 --> 03:17:12.653]  When more than 15 of the 70 products we have at InfoWarsLife.com are private labeled, highest quality, top of the line, that are sold at Whole Foods for higher prices.
[03:17:13.574 --> 03:17:15.636]  Think about the level of that fraud.
[03:17:16.562 --> 03:17:19.450]  And I've sent messages to these news organizations pointing that out.
[03:17:19.631 --> 03:17:20.232]  No response.
[03:17:20.453 --> 03:17:21.455]  They never want to get my comment.
[03:17:21.977 --> 03:17:22.879]  Now, why am I saying that?
[03:17:24.143 --> 03:17:24.544]  It's simple.
[03:17:25.578 --> 03:17:30.141]  We have a lot of proprietary original products, but a lot of them are also private labeled.
[03:17:30.522 --> 03:17:35.825]  Whatever already has five stars, whatever people already love, whatever's been tested to be the best.
[03:17:36.466 --> 03:17:37.707]  So we have a great product.
[03:17:37.827 --> 03:17:38.247]  You love it.
[03:17:38.307 --> 03:17:38.927]  You reorder it.
[03:17:39.308 --> 03:17:41.569]  The Globals are going to test our products, trying to find something.
[03:17:42.030 --> 03:17:43.951]  So we're going to be able to, you know, defeat all that.
[03:17:44.111 --> 03:17:45.172]  It's a 360 win.
[03:17:45.512 --> 03:17:46.193]  We defeat them.
[03:17:46.273 --> 03:17:46.653]  You win.
[03:17:46.773 --> 03:17:47.113]  I win.
[03:17:47.414 --> 03:17:47.914]  It's amazing.
[03:17:49.767 --> 03:17:54.552]  And you've seen them come after our attempts to even process credit cards and shut down InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:17:54.572 --> 03:18:10.189]  I mean, it's incredible not just what frauds they are and how they're anti-free market and how they're racketeering against us, not just Jeff Bezos, but this entire system of mainstream media and mainstream corporations and banking are even worse than Bezos and Amazon.
[03:18:12.118 --> 03:18:12.638]  It's hard to believe.
[03:18:12.718 --> 03:18:15.459]  I'm just illustrating how crazy this all is.
[03:18:15.539 --> 03:18:23.022]  Now, I'm going to be cutting some informational pieces in the next few weeks that go into great depth on each one of the products.
[03:18:23.862 --> 03:18:26.123]  I've done this for some of the products, but I haven't done it in a while.
[03:18:26.143 --> 03:18:35.646]  I haven't done it for the new products because, quite frankly, it's like going to school for a college exam to try to accurately talk about how great these products are.
[03:18:35.746 --> 03:18:36.466]  But just know this.
[03:18:38.464 --> 03:18:46.589]  Whatever the attributes that Jeff Bezos and Amazon and Whole Foods are allowed to tell you about their flagship products, these are as good or better.
[03:18:46.909 --> 03:18:49.130]  These are all the top of the line, very best.
[03:18:49.871 --> 03:19:00.417]  I can't even tell you what they do and the history of it and how amazing they are because they selectively enforce and will send the FDA after us.
[03:19:01.017 --> 03:19:02.098]  You see, I'm a subhuman.
[03:19:02.218 --> 03:19:02.858]  I'm garbage.
[03:19:03.879 --> 03:19:05.520]  So Bezos can make all the claims.
[03:19:05.720 --> 03:19:07.021]  Whole Foods can make all the claims.
[03:19:08.211 --> 03:19:09.594]  Because this stuff is dynamite.
[03:19:10.196 --> 03:19:11.338]  Turmeric's dynamite.
[03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:13.744]  Iodine that's clean is dynamite.
[03:19:14.886 --> 03:19:16.550]  Super Mel Vitality, they have similar products.
[03:19:16.630 --> 03:19:17.332]  It's all dynamite.
[03:19:18.908 --> 03:19:21.609]  They can tell you how great it is, and show you all the facts, and tell you.
[03:19:21.829 --> 03:19:22.770]  Because they're the elite.
[03:19:23.090 --> 03:19:23.810]  I'm just scum.
[03:19:24.430 --> 03:19:25.351]  Just like you, according to them.
[03:19:25.391 --> 03:19:27.812]  But the good news is, you've seen how great these products work.
[03:19:28.172 --> 03:19:32.353]  We do break down some of the basics on each page at mforgeslife.com to see how wonderful they are.
[03:19:32.834 --> 03:19:37.916]  But experience turmeric, experience X3, experience Supramel Vitality, Supramel Vitality.
[03:19:38.096 --> 03:19:42.117]  That, by the way, is the last run of our best-selling product, Supramel Vitality, Supramel.
[03:19:42.137 --> 03:19:48.240]  Because we can't even get the wild-crafted herbs anymore, so we can't get the supply, and I'm sick of it, so I'm discontinuing it.
[03:19:48.760 --> 03:19:49.701]  Because it's so frustrating.
[03:19:49.721 --> 03:19:52.922]  This is the last run, and it's all 50% off.
[03:19:53.062 --> 03:19:57.945]  Bodies, X3, and Supermail at mfullwarestore.com and mfullwarslife.com.
[03:19:58.125 --> 03:19:59.045]  Thanks for your support.
[03:20:06.689 --> 03:20:09.310]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.094 --> 03:20:23.584]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Mike Adams.
[03:20:24.145 --> 03:20:26.949]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:31.405 --> 03:20:31.985]  Hello and welcome.
[03:20:32.005 --> 03:20:36.228]  This is Mike Adams taking over for Alex Jones here on the fourth hour of today's broadcast.
[03:20:36.268 --> 03:20:40.511]  I've got a lot to cover over the next, I don't know, 40 minutes or so.
[03:20:40.531 --> 03:20:49.997]  I'm going to, of course, bring you new analysis and some breaking headlines on the media hoax targeting those Catholic students who wore the MAGA hats.
[03:20:50.637 --> 03:20:58.382]  I'm going to also cover the coming potential false flag to blame Trump for the government shutdown.
[03:20:58.442 --> 03:20:59.903]  Some more details on that coming up.
[03:21:00.541 --> 03:21:04.584]  A new podcast I've put out says there's no such thing as white privilege.
[03:21:04.604 --> 03:21:13.191]  I'm going to give you some notes on why that's important and also just some other news about the journal terrorism that's taking place across America today.
[03:21:13.311 --> 03:21:26.822]  But first, just to segue into that and kind of transitioning from what Alex said in the last segment, you know, something very interesting has happened over the last few years in terms of the quality of nutritional supplements.
[03:21:27.452 --> 03:21:34.404]  The quality of supplements in retail stores dominated by Whole Foods and Amazon has continued to plummet.
[03:21:34.824 --> 03:21:41.936]  And the quality of supplements that are sold direct by independent media formulators have continued to skyrocket.
[03:21:42.637 --> 03:21:43.938]  It's really quite extraordinary.
[03:21:43.958 --> 03:21:59.128]  I think today if Consumer Reports did an honest review of what's actually in these nutritional supplement products and they didn't have any bias, InfoWars products would be right there near the top of the list because they are now hiring the formulators
[03:21:59.768 --> 03:22:00.689]  We're good to go.
[03:22:29.975 --> 03:22:34.276]  Really, nutrition is a key way to beat the globalists.
[03:22:34.776 --> 03:22:44.479]  If you want to free your world, you first have to free your body from disease and stress and nutritional deficiencies.
[03:22:44.759 --> 03:22:56.403]  And the way to do that is through good, healthy food intake, food choice, superfoods, food-based dietary supplements, and key nutraceuticals that accomplish that.
[03:22:57.463 --> 03:23:00.885]  I don't think I could function today without the nutrition that I take in every day.
[03:23:01.406 --> 03:23:02.927]  And, you know, it's not we.
[03:23:03.187 --> 03:23:05.869]  We, the independent media, we're the ones who own the laboratories.
[03:23:05.909 --> 03:23:17.617]  We are the ones doing the most thorough science, scrutinizing everything for heavy metals, for microbiology, for glyphosate, for pesticides, all these things, looking at nutritional potency.
[03:23:17.997 --> 03:23:22.941]  We are like far and away above the quality of what Amazon is selling.
[03:23:23.381 --> 03:23:24.462]  Amazon.com, by the way,
[03:23:25.606 --> 03:23:31.810]  From my experience, the products that we buy on Amazon and we test in our lab, they're mostly garbage.
[03:23:32.691 --> 03:23:33.952]  And a lot of them are counterfeit.
[03:23:34.132 --> 03:23:36.954]  The counterfeiting problem is huge on Amazon.
[03:23:37.374 --> 03:23:42.838]  You can probably, I mean, I don't know if InfoWars has this problem, but we've had this problem with my brand, you know, Health Ranger brand.
[03:23:42.858 --> 03:23:47.521]  We've had counterfeit products that other people are selling on Amazon, claiming to be our products.
[03:23:47.861 --> 03:23:50.803]  So when you buy on Amazon, you don't, you really don't know what you're getting.
[03:23:51.443 --> 03:23:52.064]  Buy direct.
[03:23:52.540 --> 03:23:58.042]  From Infowars store if you want to get the real deal and to know that it's good to know it's tested.
[03:23:58.082 --> 03:23:59.963]  I just have to say that as an independent person.
[03:24:00.023 --> 03:24:01.183]  Alex didn't ask me to say that.
[03:24:01.764 --> 03:24:02.664]  I'm not paid to say it.
[03:24:03.104 --> 03:24:04.045]  I'm a food scientist.
[03:24:04.165 --> 03:24:04.985]  I see what's going on.
[03:24:05.225 --> 03:24:07.086]  I'm just sharing that news with you now.
[03:24:08.106 --> 03:24:08.827]  A couple of other.
[03:24:09.907 --> 03:24:12.248]  Really independent unpaid plugs here.
[03:24:12.328 --> 03:24:14.809]  Just things that have come across my radar that you need to know about.
[03:24:15.249 --> 03:24:17.270]  I got an email today from defense distributed.
[03:24:17.690 --> 03:24:20.791]  They have now announced their their new polymer 80.
[03:24:23.004 --> 03:24:39.472]  Product, where they now have, I guess it's a template that you put in their ghost gunner, and you can now use that router function to create your own Glock-like polymer handgun just using their machine, of course, you know, without a serial number.
[03:24:39.872 --> 03:24:41.353]  Now, it's not legal in New Jersey.
[03:24:41.393 --> 03:24:42.273]  I do want to mention that.
[03:24:42.353 --> 03:24:44.174]  New Jersey has outlawed this machine.
[03:24:44.944 --> 03:24:47.585]  But as far as I know, of course, check your local laws.
[03:24:47.985 --> 03:24:53.326]  This is legal everywhere else in the country to manufacture your own firearm for your personal use.
[03:24:53.646 --> 03:24:58.407]  You can't do it commercially, obviously, without a, you know, a firearms license, you know, a manufacturing license.
[03:24:58.867 --> 03:25:03.448]  But you can make your own firearms yourself using that defense distributed product.
[03:25:03.788 --> 03:25:07.188]  Polymer 80 is now available with the Ghost Gunner.
[03:25:07.228 --> 03:25:08.729]  That's big news as far as I'm concerned.
[03:25:09.769 --> 03:25:10.829]  Okay, also, a couple other things.
[03:25:11.508 --> 03:25:19.352]  I want to mention Fox News accidentally ran an announcement that implied that Ruth Bader Ginsburg had already died.
[03:25:20.032 --> 03:25:26.956]  Now, I talked about this last week on the show here, that Ruth Bader Ginsburg, from the information I'm getting, is
[03:25:28.824 --> 03:25:33.749]  So near death and I'm sad that she is in that state.
[03:25:33.789 --> 03:25:36.191]  We don't wish ill health upon anybody.
[03:25:36.231 --> 03:25:40.275]  We want everyone to be healthy and and have a long, happy, healthy life.
[03:25:40.615 --> 03:25:50.665]  But she is, you know, chemotherapy is poison and she has sadly been poisoned by the cancer industry to the point where now her immune function appears to be
[03:25:51.471 --> 03:25:52.412]  Heavily compromised.
[03:25:52.992 --> 03:25:55.835]  And she has reportedly contracted pneumonia.
[03:25:56.455 --> 03:25:58.737]  Although, of course, the other media are not.
[03:25:59.618 --> 03:26:00.519]  They're not covering that.
[03:26:01.099 --> 03:26:10.327]  But she may not be around much longer just because of the laws of physiology and longevity and mortality.
[03:26:10.867 --> 03:26:13.590]  Now, I know that the media already knows this.
[03:26:13.650 --> 03:26:14.651]  Fox News knows this.
[03:26:15.211 --> 03:26:16.172]  CNN knows this.
[03:26:16.252 --> 03:26:19.775]  They are preparing the graphics to announce her passing.
[03:26:20.669 --> 03:26:24.111]  And if she doesn't pass soon, she will no doubt retire from the court soon.
[03:26:24.612 --> 03:26:35.079]  I believe that this event, the potential passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is what is accelerating the plan to terminate the Trump presidency.
[03:26:35.619 --> 03:26:41.803]  Because the deranged, lawless left cannot stand for President Trump to have a third Supreme Court nominee.
[03:26:42.392 --> 03:26:52.281]  And so they are ratcheting up or accelerating dramatically calls for impeachment and plans for a political coup, as well as plans for attempted assassination of the president.
[03:26:52.741 --> 03:26:54.262]  I just want you to keep that in mind.
[03:26:54.382 --> 03:26:56.524]  We've Fox News said, oh, it was a mistake.
[03:26:56.945 --> 03:27:03.230]  But the fact that they showed that graphic tells you they are working on it because they know that her death is imminent.
[03:27:04.451 --> 03:27:06.033]  All right, another important story today.
[03:27:06.453 --> 03:27:11.239]  And by the way, the next segment, I'm going to get into the big media hoax that's been dominating headlines today.
[03:27:11.259 --> 03:27:23.733]  But another point today, Dave Hodges from the Common Sense Show had a really excellent article talking about how the conditions are ripe now for globalists to stage a false flag event involving air traffic control.
[03:27:24.440 --> 03:27:39.459]  We've seen leftists complaining that the government shutdown is causing reductions in the available crew for air traffic operations under the FAA and also TSA are reportedly a lot of people are not showing up for work because of so-called financial hardship.
[03:27:40.140 --> 03:27:50.007]  By the way, if all these government workers can't survive after missing one paycheck, it makes you wonder how they're going to survive when the dollar collapses one day, but I guess that's a whole different discussion.
[03:27:51.107 --> 03:27:52.188]  You know, they're going to go insane.
[03:27:52.208 --> 03:28:00.254]  I guess it seems like two-thirds of America can't live beyond one paycheck at this point, and government workers are no exception to that.
[03:28:00.614 --> 03:28:03.116]  But that's a very disturbing trend we should talk about later.
[03:28:03.476 --> 03:28:06.378]  But as Hodges points out correctly, the
[03:28:07.387 --> 03:28:23.258]  If a false flag event could be staged to cause airplanes, commercial jetliners to collide, or to have a collision on a runway, or for someone to slip a bomb through the TSA security and actually bomb a plane, I wouldn't put it past the globalists to carry this out.
[03:28:23.738 --> 03:28:26.058]  I mean, actually, look at history, you know?
[03:28:26.198 --> 03:28:27.679]  Look at what they've done in the past.
[03:28:28.279 --> 03:28:36.480]  And then they could blame Trump and say, look, the government shutdown is causing people to be killed, and Trump is at fault, and this is why we have to reopen government.
[03:28:36.500 --> 03:28:50.943]  So don't put it past these people to stage a major false flag event involving hundreds of fatalities just so that they can control the narrative by bombing planes themselves or even causing deliberately mid-air collisions.
[03:28:51.875 --> 03:28:54.857]  I know, it's crazy, but they will do anything at this point to get into power.
[03:28:55.217 --> 03:28:56.318]  We'll be right back after this break.
[03:28:56.338 --> 03:28:58.779]  This is Mike Adams here on Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:58.819 --> 03:28:59.260]  We'll be back.
[03:28:59.520 --> 03:28:59.940]  Stay with us.
[03:29:13.449 --> 03:29:19.653]  I recently saw a Gillette ad owned by Procter & Gamble.
[03:29:20.834 --> 03:29:25.136]  Let's spend a minute and a half showing men as the enemy.
[03:29:25.737 --> 03:29:28.398]  That if a man tries to talk to a beautiful woman, he's a bad guy.
[03:29:28.498 --> 03:29:33.161]  Or if two kids get in a fight, somehow just men fighting, period, is evil.
[03:29:35.162 --> 03:29:48.169]  When you look at the Romans conquering civilizations where they would kill all the men, or you look at black slaves with the women being kept as the house servants to suppress the men, you know that any authoritarian society seeking to dominate wants to suppress the men.
[03:29:49.540 --> 03:29:52.602]  When you read the white papers, the Global says exactly what they're doing.
[03:29:54.344 --> 03:29:57.146]  So men have now learned that this has happened.
[03:29:57.726 --> 03:30:04.331]  And there are chemicals added to the water, added to the food, trying to suppress their normal drive, their normal ethos, who they are.
[03:30:05.672 --> 03:30:11.576]  And that's why online, herbs and supplements known to boost libido, stamina, and energy are such best sellers.
[03:30:11.616 --> 03:30:13.658]  That's why I'm getting into that market.
[03:30:14.955 --> 03:30:23.482]  Six, seven years ago, as a producer, went out and found the most powerful formulas out there to not just give men, but also women, a boost.
[03:30:24.042 --> 03:30:26.384]  Super male, super female vitality.
[03:30:26.764 --> 03:30:35.831]  No one else produces a herbal formula that's cold pressed and then aged like this group does in Utah.
[03:30:36.772 --> 03:30:41.876]  And they've had so much trouble getting the wild sourced herbs that I'm having to discontinue it.
[03:30:42.895 --> 03:30:45.636]  Now they've said maybe in a year, maybe in two, they can bring it back.
[03:30:45.696 --> 03:30:49.997]  But right now, this is the last run of Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[03:30:50.038 --> 03:30:50.518]  It's 50% off.
[03:30:50.618 --> 03:30:56.240]  Even though it's selling out, I want you to experience what God gave us through nature.
[03:30:56.300 --> 03:30:59.621]  But regardless, if you're depressed, go out and go for a hike.
[03:31:00.461 --> 03:31:03.962]  If you feel like you're a loser, you know, go out and help people at a soup kitchen.
[03:31:04.783 --> 03:31:07.984]  Because all the studies show, giving is better than receiving.
[03:31:08.806 --> 03:31:11.088]  You've given to us in incredible ways at InfoWars.
[03:31:11.108 --> 03:31:16.572]  You've supported us, you've been demonized for us, you've bought our products, and you've been fulfilled by it.
[03:31:16.612 --> 03:31:17.512]  You've seen great results.
[03:31:17.773 --> 03:31:18.733]  And I thank you for that.
[03:31:19.834 --> 03:31:23.717]  But when I bring out a product, I want to make sure it's the very best I can for you at the very best price.
[03:31:23.997 --> 03:31:28.400]  Because I appreciate what you're doing, and I believe in the golden rule, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.
[03:31:29.406 --> 03:31:30.568]  So I salute you, I thank you.
[03:31:30.588 --> 03:31:38.918]  I just want to encourage you to get the last run in the foreseeable future, hopefully it comes back, of super male vitality and super female vitality.
[03:31:39.539 --> 03:31:46.347]  You know, it's funny, the price went up and up and up for it, and it is a great formula and a best seller with 4,000 plus five-star reviews, but...
[03:31:47.248 --> 03:32:02.593]  For the last year I couldn't get resupplied and I said I'm not gonna buy it the last six months and now we're in discussions maybe the herbs can be gotten and it is hard but the point is is that I'm giving you such a low price that what I'm selling it to you for becomes cost prohibitive to bring you something like this.
[03:32:03.174 --> 03:32:08.215]  We brought out powdered versions that are even stronger but are powdered and organic but not cold-pressed.
[03:32:08.575 --> 03:32:09.756]  People like them but not as much.
[03:32:10.296 --> 03:32:13.199]  Because there's something about super male and super female vitality.
[03:32:13.219 --> 03:32:18.484]  So get the last available bottles at EnforcedStore.com or call toll-free at 888-253-3139.

[03:32:51.617 --> 03:32:52.018]  Thank you all.
[03:33:06.161 --> 03:33:10.644]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.148 --> 03:33:23.774]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:24.655 --> 03:33:28.678]  Alright, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:28.698 --> 03:33:32.341]  Mike Adams here filling in as the guest host for the rest of this hour.
[03:33:33.121 --> 03:33:35.243]  And in this segment, you know, we've got to cover
[03:33:36.343 --> 03:33:53.658]  Another take on the situation where the fake news left-wing media has become truly the enemy of the people in this deliberately false coverage of the Catholic students with the MAGA hats, who the left-wing media, of course, claimed that these students were harassing this Native American Indian.
[03:33:53.698 --> 03:33:56.301]  Turns out it was exactly the opposite.
[03:33:56.961 --> 03:34:01.365]  And I want to be clear that the left-wing media did not make an honest mistake.
[03:34:01.485 --> 03:34:02.126]  They did not
[03:34:02.993 --> 03:34:06.975]  ...accidentally misrepresent the facts of the situation.
[03:34:07.575 --> 03:34:20.280]  They deliberately wrote a false narrative in order to mislead the American public and incite violence in order to harm these American students.
[03:34:21.040 --> 03:34:25.502]  The left-wing media in doing this cements its position as the enemy of the people.
[03:34:26.141 --> 03:34:33.425]  I believe that we have reached a tipping point now with this story in particular, but also, you know, the BuzzFeed fake news from a few days ago as well.
[03:34:33.905 --> 03:34:55.056]  We've reached a tipping point where it has become obvious to most Americans who are paying attention at this point that the left-wing media is actually intending to incite violence, intending to incite a civil war, and is functioning, frankly, as enemy combatants in a civil war that they have already started.
[03:34:55.740 --> 03:35:07.045]  The enemy of the people is the left-wing media, and something needs to be done under law because it is illegal to incite mob violence.
[03:35:07.485 --> 03:35:09.265]  That's exactly what the media is doing.
[03:35:09.726 --> 03:35:12.507]  They are deliberately trying to get children killed.
[03:35:13.167 --> 03:35:15.748]  They are trying to foment civil war.
[03:35:16.088 --> 03:35:17.409]  They are trying to spread violence.
[03:35:17.889 --> 03:35:22.831]  And they're doing this using a playbook that they have used over and over again, which is to take a video
[03:35:23.781 --> 03:35:34.430]  Or even stage an event and then capture video and then deliberately take that video out of context and deliberately misrepresent what was said in that video.
[03:35:34.470 --> 03:35:46.440]  This is the same thing, essentially, what CNN did with the video of, what was it, Jim Acosta, who was slamming his hand down on the arm of that White House intern at the Trump press conference.
[03:35:46.840 --> 03:35:52.325]  And then when Paul Joseph Watson released that video with commentary, CNN said, oh, that video's fake.
[03:35:53.286 --> 03:35:54.147]  They said it was doctored.
[03:35:54.227 --> 03:35:54.468]  No.
[03:35:55.189 --> 03:35:55.950]  That was real.
[03:35:56.731 --> 03:36:00.756]  What CNN has been doing with this event in Washington D.C.
[03:36:01.376 --> 03:36:01.957]  is doctored.
[03:36:02.358 --> 03:36:04.120]  When they selectively edit,
[03:36:05.169 --> 03:36:13.812]  And leave out the context of the fact that this Native American provocateur is the one who approached and started harassing these students.
[03:36:14.172 --> 03:36:15.372]  CNN leaves that out.
[03:36:15.572 --> 03:36:16.933]  That is doctoring video.
[03:36:17.313 --> 03:36:21.754]  And yet at the same time, the tech giants are complicit in all of this as well.
[03:36:22.214 --> 03:36:26.776]  Google News says the only news that they will allow you to see is the fake
[03:36:27.436 --> 03:36:28.197]  We're good to go.
[03:36:42.581 --> 03:36:43.542]  We're good to go.
[03:37:00.033 --> 03:37:05.019]  Burning down the school, that Catholic school, after locking the doors, burning those students alive.
[03:37:05.399 --> 03:37:07.642]  They called for mass shootings against those students.
[03:37:08.002 --> 03:37:13.428]  These people on Twitter have called for murdering them and harvesting their organs and other grotesque things.
[03:37:13.868 --> 03:37:14.489]  It's insane.
[03:37:14.969 --> 03:37:16.291]  And yet, Twitter won't even ban them.
[03:37:17.222 --> 03:37:29.018]  Twitter will ban you for saying that vaccines cause autism, but they won't ban you if you're a leftist demanding to burn down a school of white Catholic boys because they wore a pro-Trump hat.
[03:37:29.499 --> 03:37:31.161]  I mean, that's how insane things have become.
[03:37:33.166 --> 03:37:37.167]  ...needs to go after those individuals, and also needs to go after the journo-terrorists.
[03:37:37.727 --> 03:37:41.809]  Now that term, journo-terrorism, that's a phrase that I coined a couple of years ago.
[03:37:42.829 --> 03:37:45.170]  Once again, sort of ahead of the curve on these things.
[03:37:45.610 --> 03:37:47.811]  Now we're seeing journo-terrorism in action.
[03:37:48.311 --> 03:37:49.211]  We are seeing it happen.
[03:37:49.950 --> 03:37:53.312]  These are terrorist organizations pretending to be journalists.
[03:37:53.732 --> 03:37:59.354]  They are deliberately inciting violence and their goal is to cause massive hatred.
[03:37:59.775 --> 03:38:07.098]  Their goal is to interfere with elections because getting people to hate Trump through false information is election meddling.
[03:38:07.950 --> 03:38:16.155]  Their job is to cause a civil war and cause as much chaos as possible under the Trump administration so they can claim that Trump doesn't know how to run things.
[03:38:16.756 --> 03:38:18.617]  This is exactly what the left-wing media is doing.
[03:38:18.957 --> 03:38:20.378]  And frankly, it is illegal.
[03:38:20.778 --> 03:38:22.039]  And it needs to be investigated.
[03:38:22.219 --> 03:38:23.640]  It needs to be prosecuted.
[03:38:24.446 --> 03:38:34.555]  They do not have First Amendment protections when they are inciting violence, mob violence, against innocent individuals by deliberately misrepresenting the events that took place.
[03:38:35.095 --> 03:38:36.697]  There is no First Amendment protection.
[03:38:36.777 --> 03:38:40.800]  This is yelling fire in a crowded theater when there is no fire.
[03:38:41.161 --> 03:38:43.443]  This is exactly what the left-wing media is doing.
[03:38:43.903 --> 03:38:51.270]  And it is time, President Trump and all of you in Washington, it is time to prosecute these journal terrorists for their acts of
[03:38:51.890 --> 03:38:56.512]  Psychological terrorism and inciting mob violence in the United States of America.
[03:38:57.073 --> 03:39:01.875]  Fake news has reached a crisis point in this country, and something has to be done.
[03:39:01.895 --> 03:39:13.881]  If it isn't done by the lawmakers in Washington, then it's very clear that once the Civil War begins, that these fake news media outlets have placed themselves on the list of
[03:39:14.702 --> 03:39:22.991]  Organizations that must be dismantled in order to restore law and basic civility in our country.
[03:39:23.352 --> 03:39:34.364]  We cannot survive as a nation when these dishonest, deliberately deceptive left-wing media outlets are allowed to carry out acts of journal terrorism without any consequences.
[03:39:34.965 --> 03:39:36.026]  And this is the other point here.
[03:39:36.969 --> 03:39:39.733]  What they're doing has so far had zero consequences.
[03:39:40.254 --> 03:39:41.717]  They fabricate fake sources.
[03:39:42.037 --> 03:39:43.059]  They lie about Trump.
[03:39:43.559 --> 03:39:51.492]  There are hundreds of fake news examples of what they have falsely published about Trump and Russia collusion, that entire hoax.
[03:39:52.338 --> 03:39:57.979]  There are so many examples, literally hundreds of examples of fake news, and there have been zero consequences for them.
[03:39:58.419 --> 03:40:02.160]  There are no repercussions for publishing fake news in America.
[03:40:02.220 --> 03:40:11.222]  In fact, the more fake news you publish on the left, the more you are celebrated, the more clicks you get, the more advertisers support your platforms.
[03:40:11.402 --> 03:40:12.463]  It is sickening.
[03:40:12.743 --> 03:40:13.843]  Absolutely sickening.
[03:40:13.863 --> 03:40:15.223]  And this cannot go on.
[03:40:16.324 --> 03:40:17.664]  And in conclusion of this,
[03:40:18.462 --> 03:40:22.684]  We need to understand, the left-wing media is not operating in good faith.
[03:40:23.224 --> 03:40:25.125]  They are not engaged in journalism.
[03:40:25.645 --> 03:40:28.927]  They are not engaged in news gathering and news reporting.
[03:40:29.227 --> 03:40:33.009]  They are not engaged in First Amendment activities that are protected by the First Amendment.
[03:40:33.529 --> 03:40:39.052]  They are engaged in fomenting violence, mob violence, against innocent individuals.
[03:40:39.712 --> 03:40:41.853]  And that is not protected by the First Amendment.
[03:40:42.193 --> 03:40:44.314]  As I said, they're yelling fire in a crowded theater.
[03:40:44.654 --> 03:40:45.895]  They're not operating in good faith.
[03:40:46.517 --> 03:41:01.475]  When a media outlet interviews Alex Jones, for example, they are not interested in finding out who Alex Jones is or what motivates him or what struggles that he go through to create this media empire that is Infowars.
[03:41:01.936 --> 03:41:04.198]  They're only interested in playing gotcha.
[03:41:04.679 --> 03:41:06.381]  This is what they did to representative Steve King.
[03:41:07.054 --> 03:41:07.374]  What was it?
[03:41:07.895 --> 03:41:08.595]  Less than a week ago.
[03:41:09.036 --> 03:41:10.276]  It's about playing gotcha.
[03:41:10.697 --> 03:41:18.202]  They sit you down, they interview you for three hours, and then they pick one sentence that you may have slightly misspoken.
[03:41:18.682 --> 03:41:22.946]  And they use that one sentence to obliterate and destroy your career.
[03:41:23.506 --> 03:41:25.928]  Completely out of context in what you said.
[03:41:26.188 --> 03:41:27.469]  This is how the media operates.
[03:41:27.509 --> 03:41:28.950]  They are not operating in good faith.
[03:41:29.430 --> 03:41:32.693]  They are operating as enemies of the United States of America.
[03:41:33.013 --> 03:41:34.194]  They are enemies of the people.
[03:41:34.594 --> 03:41:35.815]  They are enemies of democracy.
[03:41:36.255 --> 03:41:37.296]  They're enemies of truth.
[03:41:38.056 --> 03:41:42.658]  All real truth from the independent media is banned, censored, maligned.
[03:41:43.339 --> 03:41:48.421]  All fake news narratives from the left-wing media is now labeled truth.
[03:41:48.901 --> 03:41:52.303]  And it's the official truth, and you are not allowed to disagree with it.
[03:41:52.623 --> 03:41:54.984]  And if you want, just here's a thought experiment.
[03:41:55.565 --> 03:42:01.888]  Imagine with the situation in Washington where this Native American man was harassing these students and beating a drum in their faces.
[03:42:03.084 --> 03:42:05.845]  And the media said the bad people are the students.
[03:42:06.225 --> 03:42:08.065]  Now imagine if the roles were reversed.
[03:42:08.605 --> 03:42:17.128]  What if a group of white students wearing Make America Great Again hats were beating drums in the faces of Native American Indians?
[03:42:18.008 --> 03:42:19.868]  Imagine that scene for a moment.
[03:42:20.148 --> 03:42:23.669]  White students beating drums in the faces of Native American Indians.
[03:42:24.489 --> 03:42:26.830]  What do you think the narrative would be from the left-wing media?
[03:42:27.270 --> 03:42:30.431]  It would be, oh, the white students are harassing the Indians.
[03:42:31.428 --> 03:42:47.259]  So, the white students are apparently wrong and bad no matter what they do, because the media is racist, the media is dishonest, the media is run by a bunch of bigots, and they have no good faith whatsoever in covering news that's important for you to know.
[03:42:47.759 --> 03:42:56.285]  They are the enemy of the people, they're the enemy of America, and ultimately, they have to be completely dismantled and stopped from destroying our nation from within.
[03:42:56.986 --> 03:42:58.907]  Much more straight ahead, we'll be back after this break.
[03:43:04.665 --> 03:43:06.046]  Excuse me, it's ma'am.
[03:43:06.206 --> 03:43:07.006]  It is ma'am.
[03:43:07.246 --> 03:43:08.827]  I can call the police if you'd like me to.
[03:43:08.887 --> 03:43:09.667]  You need to settle down.
[03:43:09.947 --> 03:43:12.488]  You need to settle down and mind your business, okay?
[03:43:12.828 --> 03:43:14.649]  Ma'am, once again, ma'am.
[03:43:14.829 --> 03:43:15.689]  I said both of you.
[03:43:16.029 --> 03:43:16.950]  No, you said sir.
[03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:18.390]  Once again, it's ma'am.
[03:43:18.891 --> 03:43:20.651]  I actually said both of you guys, General.
[03:43:20.671 --> 03:43:22.912]  Right beforehand, you f****** said sir!
[03:43:23.052 --> 03:43:23.292]  Sir?
[03:43:24.593 --> 03:43:26.093]  Motherf****r, take it outside!
[03:43:26.153 --> 03:43:29.134]  If you want to call me sir again, I will show you a f****** sir!
[03:43:29.355 --> 03:43:29.735]  I apologize.
[03:43:33.800 --> 03:43:38.126]  So, in California, if you misgender someone, it's, what, a $500 ticket?
[03:43:38.146 --> 03:43:39.568]  Maybe even jail time.
[03:43:40.469 --> 03:43:41.230]  That's oppression.
[03:43:41.871 --> 03:43:42.712]  That's mental illness.
[03:43:43.253 --> 03:43:46.397]  That's CIA, leftist, Tavistock plan.
[03:43:47.018 --> 03:43:49.461]  Where you're sterilizing little boys, telling them they're little girls.
[03:43:50.242 --> 03:43:51.362]  The Prozac isn't enough.
[03:43:51.382 --> 03:43:56.224]  You didn't give them enough vaccines to make them autistic, so you make sure they don't reproduce by turning them into mental patients.
[03:43:56.824 --> 03:44:00.365]  And almost all the young children they've, quote, turned into trans children are autistic.
[03:44:00.385 --> 03:44:01.185]  That's even been admitted.
[03:44:01.705 --> 03:44:04.886]  So it's preying on mentally ill, brain-damaged children.
[03:44:05.026 --> 03:44:07.127]  Then you've just got people that want attention.
[03:44:07.187 --> 03:44:11.548]  GameStop transgender meme re-emerges for interview with local news station.
[03:44:11.628 --> 03:44:12.769]  We're not even making fun of this.
[03:44:12.789 --> 03:44:13.429]  This is sick.
[03:44:13.509 --> 03:44:14.269]  This is obscene.
[03:44:14.449 --> 03:44:16.290]  This is state hospital on TV.
[03:44:16.330 --> 03:44:20.011]  This is the baby selfishness delusional temper tantrum.
[03:44:20.191 --> 03:44:22.613]  I'll do it a hundred thousand, a million times again.
[03:44:22.633 --> 03:44:23.413]  I loved it.
[03:44:23.453 --> 03:44:24.314]  It was good.
[03:44:24.614 --> 03:44:25.995]  It was good to fly off the handle.
[03:44:26.015 --> 03:44:27.556]  It was good to break a bunch of merchandise.
[03:44:27.776 --> 03:44:32.920]  It was good to scream and roar and yell at people when you look like He-Man from Castle Grayskull.
[03:44:33.000 --> 03:44:33.680]  He-Man!
[03:44:33.840 --> 03:44:35.161]  I'm the master of the universe!
[03:44:35.701 --> 03:44:38.183]  I have the power!
[03:44:38.223 --> 03:44:41.125]  He-Man and his power sword, Battle Skeletor.
[03:44:41.245 --> 03:44:43.647]  Let's go ahead and go to the local news with a straight face.
[03:44:43.787 --> 03:44:49.711]  This is a masterpiece in mind control talking about how he's a victim and how he's not sorry at all.
[03:44:52.874 --> 03:44:59.360]  I was so angry at that point because literally five or six times he called me sir and got me so fuming angry and I was cussing.
[03:44:59.400 --> 03:45:07.327]  The internet responding to the viral clip with means like super ma'am, aqua ma'am, and macho ma'am, tranny savage.
[03:45:07.587 --> 03:45:12.051]  Tranny is a slang term for transgender that many find offensive and derogatory.
[03:45:12.131 --> 03:45:15.855]  What's really sad is it's bringing so many bigots out of woodwork.
[03:45:16.035 --> 03:45:19.759]  But Moore, a local MC and rapper, isn't letting the memes get to her.
[03:45:20.039 --> 03:45:26.947]  She's using her newfound viral fame to raise awareness about the transgender community, and she even wrote a song to get her message out there.
[03:45:27.107 --> 03:45:28.288]  We're humans just like you.
[03:45:28.489 --> 03:45:29.630]  We're people just like you.
[03:45:30.631 --> 03:45:34.115]  We have kids, we have parents, we have brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins.
[03:45:35.156 --> 03:45:35.937]  We're just trying to live.
[03:45:36.317 --> 03:45:37.738]  We're just people just like you.
[03:45:37.758 --> 03:45:47.902]  We just come into your store, you're wearing pink shoes and a shirt, so you must be a woman, and you start screaming and yelling at a clerk and being a total jerk as they grovel and apologize and beg.
[03:45:48.322 --> 03:45:59.607]  You're just a big, fat bully who sits there and goes off the media, and they sickeningly, like some alternate dimension of unintentional comedy, with straight faces, talk about what a regular, decent, good person.
[03:45:59.627 --> 03:46:00.307]  This freak!
[03:46:00.507 --> 03:46:01.687]  Oh, don't call us a freak!
[03:46:01.787 --> 03:46:03.108]  No, no, he wants to be freakish.
[03:46:03.368 --> 03:46:07.150]  He wants you to think, what the hell is this linebacker doing in drag?
[03:46:07.230 --> 03:46:13.153]  That's all this is, is creepy dudes have learned they can do whatever the hell they want with your kids in stores anywhere!
[03:46:13.574 --> 03:46:16.635]  I'm a woman, and I'm gonna beat everything up!
[03:46:16.996 --> 03:46:20.037]  And I'm gonna kick your store, and everybody else will get arrested!
[03:46:20.297 --> 03:46:24.740]  But because I'm a man, you're not gonna be mean to a lady, are ya?!
[03:46:25.060 --> 03:46:28.062]  Then I'm gonna take you outside, and you're mean to a lady!
[03:46:28.502 --> 03:46:30.663]  Cause nobody's gonna be mean to little ladies!
[03:46:30.943 --> 03:46:31.704]  And I'm a lady!
[03:46:37.294 --> 03:46:37.974]  But you know what?
[03:46:38.414 --> 03:46:40.695]  I look back at it and if I could, I wouldn't change a single thing.
[03:46:40.715 --> 03:46:42.455]  I would do it 100,000 times again.
[03:46:42.976 --> 03:46:46.997]  I would kick over that display 100,000 times again because my actions were justified.
[03:46:47.417 --> 03:46:49.797]  I mean, it was blatant and malicious hate.
[03:46:50.297 --> 03:46:52.278]  It was blatant and malicious misgendering.
[03:46:52.758 --> 03:46:55.799]  And we reached out to GameStop's corporate office for a statement.
[03:46:55.819 --> 03:46:57.339]  We'll let you know when we hear back.
[03:46:57.439 --> 03:46:58.019]  Thank God!
[03:46:58.039 --> 03:47:00.340]  We better boycott GameStop right now!
[03:47:06.167 --> 03:47:08.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.235 --> 03:47:27.377]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:27.837 --> 03:47:31.099]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:47:33.626 --> 03:47:35.988]  All right, kicking off the final segment for today, thanks for joining me.
[03:47:36.008 --> 03:47:38.190]  Mike Adams here filling in for Alex Jones.
[03:47:38.410 --> 03:47:39.911]  Just a hilarious comment here.
[03:47:40.571 --> 03:47:44.374]  Starbucks is now selling nitrogen-infused coffee.
[03:47:44.414 --> 03:47:56.744]  They call it Nitro Cold Brew, and apparently Starbucks customers don't know anything about the atmosphere or chemistry, or they would know that the atmosphere that you are breathing is 78% nitrogen.
[03:47:58.735 --> 03:48:05.562]  And so people are paying extra for this so-called nitrogen-infused coffee, which is nothing more than air blown through your coffee.
[03:48:06.182 --> 03:48:10.466]  And Starbucks claims that it makes the coffee taste better and have a smoother texture.
[03:48:10.967 --> 03:48:11.547]  Well, guess what?
[03:48:12.088 --> 03:48:13.329]  Nitrogen is inert.
[03:48:13.669 --> 03:48:19.254]  It's an inert gas, which is why we use it in our laboratory in our triple-quad mass spec instruments.
[03:48:19.655 --> 03:48:21.817]  And as a dry-down air, it's totally inert.
[03:48:21.857 --> 03:48:22.738]  It does not interact.
[03:48:23.198 --> 03:48:24.759]  With almost any molecule.
[03:48:25.179 --> 03:48:33.042]  So a Starbucks is committing massive scientific fraud to market a product that just has air blown through it.
[03:48:33.742 --> 03:48:36.983]  And the Starbucks customers actually believe that.
[03:48:37.464 --> 03:48:41.765]  That's how incredibly illiterate they are when it comes to science.
[03:48:43.166 --> 03:48:43.986]  It's just incredible.
[03:48:44.286 --> 03:48:50.548]  Like selling you nitrogen in your coffee would be like, I don't know, the power company charging you for sunlight or something.
[03:48:50.869 --> 03:48:51.669]  You can get it for free.
[03:48:52.327 --> 03:48:52.887]  It's everywhere.
[03:48:53.688 --> 03:48:55.709]  Just inhale, you've got nitrogen.
[03:48:55.929 --> 03:48:56.349]  Go for it.
[03:48:58.670 --> 03:49:06.655]  But they attack InfoWars for selling nutrition products, while Starbucks is selling you the same nitrogen that you can get for free by simply breathing.
[03:49:07.155 --> 03:49:07.675]  It's unreal.
[03:49:08.035 --> 03:49:10.997]  Now moving on to more serious topics, I think the media
[03:49:11.829 --> 03:49:16.553]  The media owes America a national apology, and that's what I'm calling for today.
[03:49:16.913 --> 03:49:25.780]  Not only a national apology over this faked news hoax surrounding the Catholic students and the Native American Indian guy in Washington, D.C.
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:28.922]  And by the way, that guy has a history of being a provocateur.
[03:49:28.942 --> 03:49:30.324]  This isn't the first time he's done this.
[03:49:30.704 --> 03:49:32.265]  It's a pattern that he has.
[03:49:32.745 --> 03:49:37.889]  He goes in and he harasses people, and then he flips the script and lies about them.
[03:49:37.929 --> 03:49:40.932]  And of course, he has a complicit media to go along with him.
[03:49:41.412 --> 03:49:46.478]  To magnify his deception, because it happens to fit the narrative that the left-wing media wants.
[03:49:47.038 --> 03:49:54.487]  But in doing that, what they're actually demonstrating is the incredible racism and bigotry on the left, that they target students for being white.
[03:49:54.947 --> 03:49:57.730]  They target students who are just standing there smiling.
[03:49:57.750 --> 03:50:01.194]  Apparently that's a hate crime now in America, to stand there smiling.
[03:50:01.354 --> 03:50:02.135]  It's just unreal.
[03:50:03.112 --> 03:50:05.553]  But the media owes America a national apology.
[03:50:06.073 --> 03:50:10.135]  Not only just this story, but on the entire Russia collusion hoax.
[03:50:10.715 --> 03:50:13.296]  CNN, New York Times, Washington Post especially.
[03:50:13.676 --> 03:50:15.097]  They all should come out.
[03:50:15.717 --> 03:50:16.837]  Of course, they'll never do this.
[03:50:17.137 --> 03:50:19.758]  But they need to come out and say that they lied to America.
[03:50:19.798 --> 03:50:20.479]  They know they did.
[03:50:20.719 --> 03:50:21.959]  They fabricated fake sources.
[03:50:22.419 --> 03:50:23.620]  They made up false narratives.
[03:50:24.080 --> 03:50:25.941]  They took things out of context on purpose.
[03:50:26.361 --> 03:50:29.082]  They have been running a psyop on America since day one.
[03:50:29.102 --> 03:50:30.362]  Well, since Trump was elected.
[03:50:31.123 --> 03:50:32.223]  And they're going to continue to do it.
[03:50:33.357 --> 03:50:36.121]  As long as they can get away with it.
[03:50:36.842 --> 03:50:42.551]  Now, going along with them, of course, is Twitter, Google News, Facebook, and other tech giants.
[03:50:42.891 --> 03:50:45.776]  Here's a headline from the Gateway Pundit.
[03:50:47.026 --> 03:50:54.692]  Los Angeles DJ calls for Covington Catholic School to be burned down with kids locked inside and Twitter says he didn't violate the rules.
[03:50:55.293 --> 03:51:04.441]  So Twitter says that in their view it's okay to call for the mass murder of white students because they're white, to burn them to death in a school.
[03:51:04.501 --> 03:51:05.582]  Twitter says that's fine.
[03:51:06.573 --> 03:51:11.617]  But my God, if you say you love America or you want border protection, that's racist.
[03:51:11.997 --> 03:51:12.698]  So wait a second.
[03:51:13.078 --> 03:51:18.442]  So burning white students alive in their own school is perfectly acceptable?
[03:51:19.463 --> 03:51:22.765]  But saying you love your country, you want to defend your borders, that's hate?
[03:51:23.686 --> 03:51:24.627]  I mean, give me a break here!
[03:51:25.800 --> 03:51:29.901]  Isn't real hate speech saying that you want to murder unborn babies?
[03:51:30.001 --> 03:51:31.922]  That's hating babies.
[03:51:31.942 --> 03:51:33.262]  That's hating human beings.
[03:51:33.722 --> 03:51:37.723]  If you are murdering babies in partial birth abortions, that's hate speech.
[03:51:38.423 --> 03:51:43.345]  But no, the tech giants say it's actually hateful if you say that abortion is bad.
[03:51:43.585 --> 03:51:44.345]  That's hateful.
[03:51:44.825 --> 03:51:48.446]  That's somehow wrong to say that human lives matter.
[03:51:49.116 --> 03:51:51.057]  This is how twisted the tech giants have become.
[03:51:51.558 --> 03:51:52.839]  They are complicit in this.
[03:51:52.899 --> 03:51:56.041]  They are part of this assault on our culture.
[03:51:56.321 --> 03:51:57.942]  They're part of this assault on life.
[03:51:58.683 --> 03:52:01.325]  And it goes to so many different levels.
[03:52:02.445 --> 03:52:06.108]  You know, the CounterThink episode that I broadcast yesterday on InfoWars,
[03:52:06.994 --> 03:52:15.539]  It was entitled, How to Spot a Demon, and it talked about how to identify people who are truly possessed by demonic influences.
[03:52:15.939 --> 03:52:19.942]  That is really the root cause of so many of the problems we're seeing.
[03:52:20.542 --> 03:52:32.269]  I gotta say, not all of the people, even so-called people, that you're seeing operating in the left, in the left-wing media, they're not all, you know, how do I say this correctly?
[03:52:32.918 --> 03:52:34.859]  They're not all human.
[03:52:35.020 --> 03:52:46.448]  They are answering to demonic possession and demonic spirits and evil spirits, and they pray to Satan, and they conduct these weird séances, and they love child sacrifice.
[03:52:46.468 --> 03:52:47.749]  This is why they're pro-abortion.
[03:52:48.089 --> 03:52:54.994]  They love murdering life, using it to give them some kind of weird, dark, twisted power that they use over the entire world.
[03:52:55.034 --> 03:52:59.618]  This is a spiritual battle as much as it is a political battle and a culture war.
[03:53:00.842 --> 03:53:07.925]  Along those lines, I've just published a new podcast called There's No Such Thing as White Privilege, and I really encourage you to listen to that podcast.
[03:53:07.965 --> 03:53:13.588]  It's on Brighteon.com, of course, but you can get to it from the National News homepage on the right column there.
[03:53:14.921 --> 03:53:23.008]  In this podcast, I explain that, you know, we all want to live in a world where people are judged by the merit, the content of who they are.
[03:53:23.028 --> 03:53:24.649]  I mean, Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:53:24.769 --> 03:53:31.014]  said, I want my daughter to grow up in a world where we're judged not by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character.
[03:53:31.394 --> 03:53:41.783]  You know, Martin Luther King today would be considered a conservative, absolutely a conservative, cultural conservative, because he believed in a merit-based society.
[03:53:42.389 --> 03:53:43.830]  And that's what I'm saying in my podcast.
[03:53:44.230 --> 03:53:53.096]  We want a merit-based society where people are not hated or punished or given extra bonuses based on the color of their skin.
[03:53:53.457 --> 03:54:02.363]  Where every person has to earn their position, whether it's an admission into a university, a job position, or, you know, any other government position, something like that.
[03:54:02.723 --> 03:54:04.024]  You need to earn your way there.
[03:54:04.778 --> 03:54:06.559]  But instead today, we don't have white privilege.
[03:54:06.759 --> 03:54:08.000]  We have minority privilege.
[03:54:08.461 --> 03:54:09.641]  We have white punishment.
[03:54:09.962 --> 03:54:11.343]  You are punished for being white.
[03:54:11.683 --> 03:54:20.689]  You are targeted for being white, as we just found out over the weekend with these Catholic students who were harassed and vilified and death-threatened because they were white.
[03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:22.350]  How's that white privilege?
[03:54:22.991 --> 03:54:24.732]  That's actually being punished for being white.
[03:54:25.635 --> 03:54:31.061]  The privilege was enjoyed by the Native American provocateur slash crisis actor guy.
[03:54:31.121 --> 03:54:42.074]  He got all the privilege to say anything he wanted and to lie and to deceive and to control the media without any fact-checking about what he claimed because he was lying the entire time.
[03:54:42.415 --> 03:54:44.317]  This is, you're watching minority privilege!
[03:54:45.109 --> 03:54:46.049]  Not white privilege.
[03:54:46.329 --> 03:54:48.710]  White people are punished in this society.
[03:54:49.010 --> 03:54:52.172]  And I say that as someone, by the way, whose wife is an immigrant.
[03:54:52.752 --> 03:54:58.454]  And myself, I am, according to my ancestors, I'm about 10% Native American myself.
[03:54:59.254 --> 03:55:02.275]  So, you know, you can't put me in the same box.
[03:55:02.555 --> 03:55:04.376]  You know, I'm a diverse person as well.
[03:55:05.208 --> 03:55:09.009]  But as a diverse person, I believe in a merit-based society.
[03:55:09.609 --> 03:55:11.050]  I run a large organization.
[03:55:11.530 --> 03:55:13.631]  You know, I employ over a hundred people.
[03:55:14.171 --> 03:55:16.132]  And I don't judge people by the color of their skin.
[03:55:16.752 --> 03:55:20.333]  I don't fire or hire people based on what they look like on the outside.
[03:55:21.213 --> 03:55:24.754]  I hire and fire based on their performance and who they are on the inside.
[03:55:25.294 --> 03:55:27.975]  Their dedication, their courage, their intelligence, their honesty.
[03:55:28.676 --> 03:55:31.837]  And this is exactly what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:55:32.357 --> 03:55:33.057]  spoke about.
[03:55:33.760 --> 03:55:44.006]  And so if we are to celebrate Martin Luther King today, which I think it's a great idea to celebrate those ideals, we should be celebrating a merit-based society, a meritocracy.
[03:55:44.326 --> 03:55:48.249]  And that is the opposite of what the radical left wants for America.
[03:55:48.609 --> 03:55:49.830]  They want to play victims.
[03:55:50.470 --> 03:55:53.371]  They want to punish you for the way you were born.
[03:55:53.792 --> 03:56:00.294]  This is the same group that used to say that gay people are born gay and you shouldn't punish them for the way they were born.
[03:56:00.574 --> 03:56:08.698]  But now they say white people are born white and they're demons and devils and they have to be punished for a lifetime because of the way they were born and the color of their skin.
[03:56:09.278 --> 03:56:11.119]  The bigotry is from the Democrats.
[03:56:11.479 --> 03:56:12.780]  The bigotry is from the left.
[03:56:13.220 --> 03:56:15.881]  We are now living in a society of minority privilege
[03:56:16.741 --> 03:56:23.627]  Where the minority class, the victim class, is running hate campaigns against people based on the color of their skin.
[03:56:24.268 --> 03:56:25.849]  That's how twisted things have become.
[03:56:26.750 --> 03:56:30.934]  This is far from the society that Dr. Martin Luther King laid out for us.
[03:56:31.254 --> 03:56:34.637]  The society of fairness and real justice.
[03:56:34.977 --> 03:56:37.940]  A society of honoring the divinity of every human being.
[03:56:38.570 --> 03:56:39.871]  We are so far from that now.
[03:56:39.931 --> 03:56:57.258]  We are in this twisted, dark underworld of bigotry and hatred pushed by the left while they claim to have a monopoly on all facts and a monopoly on all news and claim that this report or any other report that you get from Natural News or InfoWars, they claim that's false when we are the only ones telling the truth.
[03:56:58.211 --> 03:57:00.132]  The left-wing media lies by default.
[03:57:00.612 --> 03:57:02.372]  Even Scott Adams found that out lately.
[03:57:02.412 --> 03:57:09.694]  He got duped temporarily by this story about this, and he apologized to the students of the Catholic school.
[03:57:09.734 --> 03:57:10.294]  He got duped.
[03:57:10.935 --> 03:57:12.495]  Even Scott Adams was just reminded.
[03:57:13.015 --> 03:57:15.236]  Never believe the left-wing media by default.
[03:57:15.776 --> 03:57:16.476]  Never believe them.
[03:57:17.456 --> 03:57:18.657]  Because they lie by default.
[03:57:19.377 --> 03:57:20.137]  That is what they do.
[03:57:20.957 --> 03:57:22.618]  Their job is to destroy America.
[03:57:23.280 --> 03:57:24.581]  Their job is to destroy this country.
[03:57:25.001 --> 03:57:27.022]  Their job is to incite hatred and violence.
[03:57:27.323 --> 03:57:28.443]  And they're going to get people killed.
[03:57:29.264 --> 03:57:41.531]  And when someone gets killed from this, I hope to God that the Trump administration prosecutes those journal terrorists for inciting mob violence and being part of that violence being committed against people based on the color of their skin.
[03:57:41.832 --> 03:57:43.393]  These are hate crimes, essentially.
[03:57:44.353 --> 03:57:44.773]  There you go.
[03:57:45.554 --> 03:57:46.234]  Thanks for watching.
[03:57:46.915 --> 03:57:48.676]  This is Mike Adams for the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:55.777 --> 03:57:57.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new year is here.
[03:57:58.260 --> 03:58:13.378]  And I personally, in the new year, am looking at all the great supplements and products at EnforcedLife.com and saying, what do I need to take religiously that I'm forgetting to take, that lowers inflammation, that empowers all the cells in the body, that makes me healthier, better stamina, libido, energy?
[03:58:13.638 --> 03:58:14.600]  And it's these three babies.
[03:58:15.420 --> 03:58:19.244]  It's Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Curcuminoid.
[03:58:19.324 --> 03:58:20.365]  Nobody else can top that.
[03:58:20.385 --> 03:58:21.806]  Top of the line in the nation.
[03:58:22.526 --> 03:58:28.351]  It's X3 that has all three of the good types of iodine together, including the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[03:58:28.832 --> 03:58:34.337]  Because some people can't absorb that type, we put a little bit of the other two types and a tiny bit of Vitamin C to stabilize it.
[03:58:34.577 --> 03:58:37.279]  And then Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[03:58:37.699 --> 03:58:41.603]  Super Male Vitality has been our overall most successful product.
[03:58:42.003 --> 03:58:44.665]  Neck and neck with Brain Force Plus.
[03:58:45.266 --> 03:58:51.431]  But because it's wildcrafted and a proprietary process, we weren't able to get it for long periods of time.
[03:58:52.372 --> 03:58:56.796]  And so I made the decision just to discontinue it and try to reformulate.
[03:58:57.236 --> 03:58:58.917]  But it's been very, very hard to do.
[03:58:58.937 --> 03:58:59.718]  So we're not discontinuing it.
