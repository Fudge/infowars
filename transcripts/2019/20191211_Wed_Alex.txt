[00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:15.827]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:22.151]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:28.316]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:31.219]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:36.503]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.504]  This story does not add up.
[00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:58.841]  We're good to go.
[00:02:32.728 --> 00:02:39.330]  You know what's amazing is that it's all coming out that there were dark, bloodless forces working with Saudi Arabia and others to stage 9-11.
[00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.511]  And then they bring in record Islamicists after they stage it.
[00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:47.752]  And they collapse the borders of Europe and bring in the Islamicists.
[00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:52.535]  It really is incredible how we're being vindicated on every front.
[00:02:52.535 --> 00:03:03.982]  They also came out yesterday in a big story I'm going to cover after the first break and said, oh, China is creating monkey pig clones.
[00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:05.743]  Well, they didn't just start doing that.
[00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:07.069]  I don't know.
[00:03:26.817 --> 00:03:40.961]  We're gonna open the phones up throughout the broadcast again to give people a chance to respond to the IG report, the ongoing historic, super ultra-thin impeachment situation, and so much more.
[00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:48.143]  And then everyone in awe of Owen Schroyer just standing up and saying, you're the ones involved in treason.
[00:03:48.143 --> 00:03:52.985]  Remember the congressman who famously stood up to Obama in the State of the Union and said, you lie?
[00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:56.878]  They talked about trying to remove him from Congress, censuring him.
[00:03:56.878 --> 00:04:00.359]  What's the name of that congressman?
[00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:07.561]  And Obama was saying, we're not going to cover immigrants or illegal aliens under Obamacare, even though that was in the plan.
[00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:08.861]  He was just saying, you lie!
[00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:10.041]  We've read the plan!
[00:04:10.041 --> 00:04:13.903]  And of course today, Obamacare does cover all of that.
[00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:18.744]  And the country is going bankrupt and falling into a giant hole, but the Democrats know exactly
[00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.980]  What's going on?
[00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:35.454]  Supposedly to submit to them, but that's not the way it's going.
[00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:38.816]  So this is the most banned, demonized, lied about broadcast in the world.
[00:04:38.816 --> 00:04:40.876]  The globalists just cannot stand it.
[00:04:40.876 --> 00:04:43.578]  When you spread the word to friends, family, and neighbors.
[00:04:43.578 --> 00:04:47.639]  When you spread the word via text message, via email, via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
[00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.361]  I would just say, here's the forbidden number one broadcast.
[00:04:50.361 --> 00:04:51.041]  They don't want you to see.
[00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:53.422]  Don't use my evil name, Alex Jones.
[00:04:53.422 --> 00:04:55.963]  We'll be back in the battle for human liberty, straight ahead.
[00:04:59.133 --> 00:05:06.937]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to InfoWars with free shipping storewide and double Patriot Points.

[00:05:53.194 --> 00:06:05.202]  Again, find this amazing special and over a hundred others at InfoWareStore.com and support the InfoWare.
[00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:10.166]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:45.353 --> 00:07:06.801]  Can you believe that we live in a country where the president has to get up in a speech in Pennsylvania and talk about the corrupt scum that run the FBI?
[00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:12.163]  And it's true, what he said.
[00:07:12.163 --> 00:07:12.843]  It's a reality.
[00:07:13.911 --> 00:07:20.915]  I've eyeballed what's going on with Barr and Durham and Horowitz.
[00:07:20.915 --> 00:07:27.178]  And there is definitely an internal war going on inside the deep state over who controls the deep state.
[00:07:27.178 --> 00:07:32.501]  That's Trump's biggest success is he's got a civil war going on inside the swamp.
[00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:36.583]  He is trying to manage the country for the American people and for world peace.
[00:07:36.583 --> 00:07:38.104]  I think the president is a champion.
[00:07:38.104 --> 00:07:39.345]  I'm very supportive of the president.
[00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:49.778]  With that said, if he doesn't get a handle on election fraud and election meddling, which Big Tech's involved in, they are going to take it away from Trump.
[00:07:49.778 --> 00:08:04.421]  And they're only running this impeachment fiasco right now to change the subject away from the horrible jobs the Democrats are doing in states and cities they control, and to continue to project onto Trump that he's anti-American.
[00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:09.542]  Former interim FBI Director McCabe was on CNN last night.
[00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:11.122]  I'm going to play the clip coming up later in the hour.
[00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:16.358]  And it was shocking evidence of Russian collusion.
[00:08:16.358 --> 00:08:18.440]  And they've got that back everywhere.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.501]  They're trying that again now.
[00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:22.823]  I see the talking point everywhere.
[00:08:22.823 --> 00:08:24.624]  Last week it was, no one's above the law.
[00:08:24.624 --> 00:08:25.525]  Now it's Russia.
[00:08:25.525 --> 00:08:32.510]  Trump's with Russia because the foreign minister, Lavrov, was in the Oval Office.
[00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.232]  And McCabe said, this has never before been done.
[00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:54.176]  In about 30 seconds, I pulled up other Russian foreign ministers of the past in the Oval Office, in the White House, drinking alcohol with presidents, dressed up in silly outfits, getting drunk in Russia, in the U.S., in the White House, outside the White House.
[00:08:54.176 --> 00:08:55.456]  It's just a total lie.
[00:08:55.456 --> 00:09:00.058]  But again, someone watching that would believe that this has never before been done.
[00:09:00.058 --> 00:09:01.639]  They're like, it's never before been done.
[00:09:02.588 --> 00:09:10.132]  Lavrov standing behind the President at the Oval Office desk, showing he's in control of the White House.
[00:09:10.132 --> 00:09:17.096]  I mean, Trump takes in baseball teams, football teams, elementary school students, church leaders, they all get behind the desk.
[00:09:17.096 --> 00:09:27.382]  That now, by magical alchemy of the BS machine, turns into McCabe on the show and they're just shaking their heads and they go, we just can't.
[00:09:29.608 --> 00:09:31.250]  Believe it.
[00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.632]  It's just too incredible.
[00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:45.723]  And he denies he's a Russian agent, but here it is, and the host cups her face and just looks down and McCabe shakes his head.
[00:09:45.723 --> 00:09:47.044]  It's all theater with these people.
[00:09:48.718 --> 00:09:50.280]  And we've got all the headlines out there.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.521]  We've got to impeach Trump.
[00:09:51.521 --> 00:09:53.062]  He's hurting America.
[00:09:53.062 --> 00:09:54.584]  He betrayed America.
[00:09:54.584 --> 00:09:56.526]  He's anti-American.
[00:09:56.526 --> 00:10:04.133]  The globalists are traitors inside governments, selling countries out to multinational world government.
[00:10:04.133 --> 00:10:06.415]  A corporate world government.
[00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:12.962]  Their ethos, their leftist system, is no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:23.669]  And then they tell us that the existence of our country is bad and that Trump's saying we should be proud of our nation is bad.
[00:10:23.669 --> 00:10:30.014]  And they take knees during the national anthem and hate the American flag and tell you they do.
[00:10:30.014 --> 00:10:37.659]  Globalism is a system of getting rid of the nation state.
[00:10:37.659 --> 00:10:40.982]  And then they sit there and tell you Trump's the one hurting America, waging war on America.
[00:10:40.982 --> 00:10:45.005]  It is beyond upside down world.
[00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:48.608]  It is spectacular.
[00:10:48.608 --> 00:10:50.609]  And that's why they're engaged in all the massive censorship.
[00:10:50.609 --> 00:10:52.590]  Now, not just against me, but millions of people.
[00:10:52.590 --> 00:11:09.179]  It's because you can't say crazy things like this and do crazy things like this if there's any opposition.
[00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:09.899]  You can't say
[00:11:14.192 --> 00:11:20.614]  The flower behind me is blue, and everybody's watching it, and they say, no, it's red.
[00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:28.396]  Or the holly behind me is green, and somebody else says it's purple.
[00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:33.718]  I mean, if you can see it, and you know, and you have a voice, you can call it out.
[00:11:33.718 --> 00:11:39.460]  And if it's a five-year-old, if I say that holly is orange,
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.021]  And somebody else says, no, that Holly's green.
[00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:47.602]  Any five-year-old child, even a mentally retarded one, will tell you that's green.
[00:11:47.602 --> 00:11:49.903]  And they'll tell you who's the liar.
[00:11:49.903 --> 00:12:05.949]  But if they can silence everyone, they can sit there and tell you that Holly is red, and that the poinsettias are black.
[00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:09.090]  And that's really all this is, is massive gaslighting.
[00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:09.870]  And I, for one,
[00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:14.498]  No, it's failing.
[00:12:14.498 --> 00:12:19.060]  But it's causing mass mental illness in people that do believe it.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:25.443]  I mean, people that have bought into this, that come up and threaten Devin Nunes in a New York hotel lobby.
[00:12:25.443 --> 00:12:26.404]  He talked about it yesterday.
[00:12:26.404 --> 00:12:34.948]  They really believe we are KGB agents.
[00:12:34.948 --> 00:12:37.850]  And they really believe Holly is red.
[00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.771]  And that roses are green.
[00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:43.425]  And they believe whatever else they're told.
[00:12:43.425 --> 00:12:46.147]  They believe men can have babies.
[00:12:46.147 --> 00:12:52.394]  They believe it's good to have NAMBLA in schools teaching five-year-olds how to masturbate.
[00:12:52.394 --> 00:12:55.016]  Now, if you're on air and can challenge that, you're going to win the debate.
[00:12:55.016 --> 00:13:00.802]  But see, they don't want anybody to be able to hear what's going on, and that's why that's so critical.
[00:13:00.802 --> 00:13:03.585]  So we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today here.
[00:13:05.967 --> 00:13:07.428]  And I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:13:07.428 --> 00:13:08.729]  We've got several guests joining us.
[00:13:08.729 --> 00:13:10.470]  Big election over in the UK.
[00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.232]  Major referendum on nationalism fighting globalism.
[00:13:14.232 --> 00:13:16.133]  Conservatives set to win big.
[00:13:16.133 --> 00:13:19.895]  Massive demonstrations all across Europe against globalism and carbon taxes.
[00:13:19.895 --> 00:13:23.277]  Very exciting things to see the awakening accelerating around the planet.
[00:13:23.277 --> 00:13:26.439]  There's an article up on Infowars.com.
[00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:29.080]  Kit Daniels put out, makes a great point.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.660]  Trump Jr.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:30.981]  makes a great point.
[00:13:30.981 --> 00:13:33.963]  The Time Magazine gave Greta Thunberg the antifa
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.063]  Autistic young lady, victim of brainwashing.
[00:13:39.063 --> 00:13:42.906]  The cover of Time Magazine is, if that means anything, that's an embarrassment.
[00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.947]  Instead of giving it to the Hong Kong protesters.
[00:13:44.947 --> 00:13:46.909]  But that's because Time is a joke.
[00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:50.752]  They give peace prizes to warmongers.
[00:13:50.752 --> 00:13:55.236]  And so the peace prize is a joke.
[00:13:55.236 --> 00:13:57.898]  And so you wouldn't want to be on the cover of Time Magazine.
[00:13:57.898 --> 00:13:59.139]  Unless they were saying you were a villain.
[00:13:59.855 --> 00:14:01.296]  But yeah, they wanted to redeem themselves.
[00:14:01.296 --> 00:14:03.937]  They would put Hong Kong freedom protesters on the cover.
[00:14:03.937 --> 00:14:07.119]  But of course, they don't do that because they're authoritarians.
[00:14:07.119 --> 00:14:10.141]  They don't like that.
[00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:10.821]  Now we're going to go to break.
[00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:14.883]  We're going to come back and plow through the speech last night.
[00:14:14.883 --> 00:14:17.284]  Democrats saying even if they don't impeach him now, they'll impeach him in 2020.
[00:14:18.812 --> 00:14:20.153]  It's amazing.
[00:14:20.153 --> 00:14:21.755]  We're loaded for bear here today.
[00:14:21.755 --> 00:14:42.171]  Please don't forget we've got the 12 Days of Christmas going right now with free shipping, double Patriot points, and each day we've got new huge sales and huge new specials that are going.
[00:14:42.171 --> 00:14:43.532]  And it's your purchase of the products.
[00:14:46.365 --> 00:14:48.086]  Make this broadcast possible.
[00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:49.766]  And I'm very, very thankful for you keeping us on air.
[00:14:49.766 --> 00:14:52.167]  But quite frankly, these are products you really need.
[00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:55.468]  We have Super Blue Toothpaste with Coil Silver and Iodine in it.
[00:14:55.468 --> 00:14:59.169]  Fluoride-free, fortified on top of that with tea tree that knocks out fungus.
[00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:00.409]  There's a lot of that in the mouth.
[00:15:00.409 --> 00:15:01.349]  Very critical.
[00:15:01.349 --> 00:15:03.870]  Best toothpaste you're going to find for multispectrum.
[00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.911]  It's 50% off back in stock for adults.
[00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:08.011]  Children's was never out of stock.
[00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:08.792]  It's bubblegum flavor.
[00:15:08.792 --> 00:15:09.612]  They love it.
[00:15:09.612 --> 00:15:11.092]  And it's not toxic when they brush their teeth.
[00:15:11.092 --> 00:15:13.113]  And then we also have Super Silver.
[00:15:15.037 --> 00:15:25.852]  Also fluoride-free toothpaste with the above-sea coral calcium that re-mineralizes the teeth and the patented nano-silver that annihilates plaque like nothing else in major studies.
[00:15:25.852 --> 00:15:31.921]  With the fluoride-free whitening toothpaste combo, where you get all three of those together, 50% off, or get them separately.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.260]  Discounted as well.
[00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.021]  No reviews there.
[00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:39.502]  That's a brand new special, but there's thousands of reviews for the others on the single order page.
[00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:41.343]  Be sure and read those reviews.
[00:15:41.343 --> 00:15:43.063]  And again, please, think about where you spend your money.
[00:15:43.063 --> 00:15:44.564]  Spend it with folks that are fighting for freedom.
[00:15:44.564 --> 00:15:45.944]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:47.385]  These are great products you need.
[00:15:47.385 --> 00:15:50.466]  Check out the huge sales, including on Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:55.668]  Find out what's in Real Red Pill Plus and Real Red Pill, and about the free bottle of bio-crystallinium with each order.
[00:15:55.668 --> 00:15:55.968]  Stay with us.
[00:15:58.171 --> 00:15:59.392]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:15:59.392 --> 00:16:03.313]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:03.313 --> 00:16:04.854]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:04.854 --> 00:16:07.815]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:07.815 --> 00:16:13.017]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:13.357 --> 00:16:14.558]  I can help you, too.
[00:16:14.558 --> 00:16:17.500]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.721]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:16:19.721 --> 00:16:24.164]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.

[00:16:25.865 --> 00:16:27.886]  DanPilla.com.
[00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:30.528]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[00:16:30.528 --> 00:16:38.893]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:16:39.053 --> 00:16:48.359]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:16:48.359 --> 00:16:53.643]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:16:53.643 --> 00:17:05.831]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:07.092]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:17:07.092 --> 00:17:09.053]  Check out the PPX microgrid system.
[00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:09.814]  That's right.
[00:17:27.188 --> 00:17:29.830]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.931]  Get back to nature.

[00:17:53.967 --> 00:17:56.629]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[00:18:00.407 --> 00:18:03.770]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech.
[00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:12.436]  I actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago, and I've found a few places where it's mentioned, but if you can find it, please send it to showtipsinfowars.com.
[00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:21.703]  And he talked about in the darkest hours of the beginning of World War II, the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and were assured of victory.
[00:18:21.703 --> 00:18:27.848]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[00:18:27.848 --> 00:18:28.749]  There's a third time
[00:18:29.469 --> 00:18:35.534]  When you know you're going to lose, but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[00:18:35.534 --> 00:18:36.876]  That's a paraphrase.
[00:18:36.876 --> 00:18:45.163]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit, find our focus, and don't give up and take action.
[00:18:45.163 --> 00:18:50.667]  But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:51.588]  That's a fact.
[00:18:51.588 --> 00:18:54.230]  They fear Infowars because we are alive.
[00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.913]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[00:18:59.136 --> 00:19:02.598]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[00:19:02.598 --> 00:19:04.559]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:08.040]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.882]  And that's taking care of our individual health.
[00:19:10.882 --> 00:19:26.670]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to infowarestore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life-changing in what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health.
[00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.953]  Your stamina, your libido, but then of course it also funds the info war that is so incredibly critical.
[00:19:32.953 --> 00:19:38.235]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that it's a true 360 win?
[00:19:38.235 --> 00:19:46.139]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[00:19:46.659 --> 00:19:54.406]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at InfowarStore.com.
[00:19:54.406 --> 00:19:56.248]  That's InfowarStore.com.
[00:19:56.248 --> 00:20:01.973]  Please make the right decision.
[00:20:01.973 --> 00:20:04.635]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:19.938 --> 00:20:24.760]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.842]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:29.842 --> 00:20:38.625]  Alright, everybody knows that I predicted that the IG report would be a big whitewash.
[00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:40.026]  I am not sure about Durham.
[00:20:40.026 --> 00:20:45.748]  He's one of the few people that has a history of actually going after the corrupt elements, the CIA and FBI.
[00:20:45.748 --> 00:20:48.309]  And I gotta say, the things that Barr has said and done
[00:20:49.648 --> 00:21:11.957]  Openly brings out that there is a big fight going on and that there are criminal investigations taking place for the crimes publicly committed by McCabe and by Mueller and by people like Comey at the behest of Clapper and Brennan and then their minion Obama.
[00:21:11.957 --> 00:21:14.558]  That's right, those guys are really above Obama.
[00:21:14.558 --> 00:21:17.419]  Hillary's co-equal with that gaggle of crooks.
[00:21:19.994 --> 00:21:29.480]  But Barr has come out, we'll play this next segment, and said FBI falsified docs to continue spying on Trump under 2016.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.280]  That's illegal.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.161]  They need to be indicted.
[00:21:31.161 --> 00:21:35.363]  But see, people that did it were ordered to do so, so they will turn state's evidence.
[00:21:35.363 --> 00:21:41.026]  That's why it's being covered up.
[00:21:41.026 --> 00:21:43.088]  And so, I do see some good signs here.
[00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:45.669]  There's a real fight going on and that Trump's putting a lot of pressure on him.
[00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:48.371]  And you see that when he comes out last night and calls them
[00:21:50.221 --> 00:21:58.588]  Now, John Bowne's done a particularly good group of reports.
[00:21:58.588 --> 00:22:00.090]  All his reports are good.
[00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.332]  The ones that have me in them a bunch are okay.
[00:22:02.332 --> 00:22:04.714]  But the ones he's been doing lately are really, really powerful.
[00:22:06.567 --> 00:22:09.229]  The IG report findings the Dems don't want you to know about.
[00:22:09.229 --> 00:22:12.392]  That's at band.video in the John Bowne Reporter section.
[00:22:12.392 --> 00:22:13.834]  I suggest you share it.
[00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:14.955]  We want to wake folks up.
[00:22:14.955 --> 00:22:19.459]  Also, as BPA study reveals, it's far worse than FDA had first admitted.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.282]  You want to have your girl get cancer?
[00:22:24.282 --> 00:22:25.302]  Drink some BPA.
[00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:26.463]  Want to have a miscarriage?
[00:22:26.463 --> 00:22:27.824]  Drink some BPA.
[00:22:27.824 --> 00:22:29.685]  These are all just amazing reports.
[00:22:29.685 --> 00:22:31.907]  The Saudi terror, no one can talk about.
[00:22:31.907 --> 00:22:32.848]  That's another big report.
[00:22:32.848 --> 00:22:34.189]  Bowne just turned out on the last day.
[00:22:34.189 --> 00:22:36.110]  I mean, he's on fire.
[00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.672]  You can tell he's pissed about the fake impeachment.
[00:22:38.672 --> 00:22:40.233]  You can always tell when Bowne's pissed off.
[00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:42.054]  I love Bowne.
[00:22:42.054 --> 00:22:46.457]  And we should get him in studio more often.
[00:22:46.457 --> 00:22:47.558]  He's a great reporter as well.
[00:22:49.082 --> 00:22:53.745]  But here's his report, the IG report findings the Dems don't want you to know about.
[00:22:53.745 --> 00:22:59.809]  Then we'll come back with some of the speech last night and get into what the Attorney General said.
[00:22:59.809 --> 00:23:04.312]  But this is an unprecedented time.
[00:23:04.312 --> 00:23:08.896]  And Horowitz trying to cover up is only going to blow up in their face.
[00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:14.083]  And when you have Comey coming out yesterday and saying, this shows Trump made it up.
[00:23:14.083 --> 00:23:15.883]  No one ever wiretapped him.
[00:23:15.883 --> 00:23:17.444]  Nobody ever tapped his wires.
[00:23:17.444 --> 00:23:18.304]  That's the quote.
[00:23:18.304 --> 00:23:22.326]  Because you don't call it a wiretap for almost 30 years in court documents.
[00:23:22.326 --> 00:23:23.426]  You don't hook into a wire.
[00:23:23.426 --> 00:23:24.927]  It's digital.
[00:23:24.927 --> 00:23:27.388]  So just a very insulting lie to everybody.
[00:23:27.388 --> 00:23:29.588]  It's public that they illegally spied.
[00:23:29.588 --> 00:23:30.789]  It's come out they spied.
[00:23:30.789 --> 00:23:31.829]  They lied about it to Congress.
[00:23:31.829 --> 00:23:32.569]  They've been caught.
[00:23:32.569 --> 00:23:33.650]  That's another crime.
[00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.652]  I mean, this is really flaunting it in everybody's face.
[00:23:39.872 --> 00:23:42.454]  So we're going to play this John Bowne report, and I love you audience.
[00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:43.355]  You're the best out there.
[00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:44.115]  You're activists.
[00:23:44.115 --> 00:23:45.436]  You get that.
[00:23:45.436 --> 00:23:49.439]  But please go to Band.Video, to the John Bowne link there on the left.
[00:23:49.439 --> 00:23:51.541]  Just click all the different links in the sub-pages.
[00:23:51.541 --> 00:23:55.764]  Go and get this report and share it, because that's how we get the information out.
[00:23:55.764 --> 00:23:58.166]  And you've been doing it, so I want to say amazing job.
[00:23:58.166 --> 00:24:00.587]  This Traffic to Band.Video is off the charts.
[00:24:00.587 --> 00:24:01.168]  Here's the report.
[00:24:02.074 --> 00:24:10.860]  I was distraught right after the election, but I'm now actually invigorated by the challenge and our ability to succeed in this challenge.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:15.783]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:24:15.783 --> 00:24:20.006]  The fools on the Hill actually introduced articles of impeachment.
[00:24:20.006 --> 00:24:30.453]  Ultimately, not to impeach a president they hate based on lies, but to impeach the votes of the silent majority of so-called deplorable Americans that voted him in.
[00:24:32.615 --> 00:24:33.675]  If you impeach a president,
[00:24:55.683 --> 00:25:03.789]  If you make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to the courts, it is an abuse of power.
[00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:05.911]  It's your abuse of power.
[00:25:05.911 --> 00:25:13.697]  The idea that they're going to change the course of history, that staff is going to interview staff, and then they're going to come out with articles of impeachment?
[00:25:13.697 --> 00:25:19.081]  What power do members of Congress who run to represent their districts have that they take it away?
[00:25:19.081 --> 00:25:25.226]  The idea that Democrats could control who can ask questions inside a hearing, or how the structure would go.
[00:25:26.334 --> 00:25:27.395]  That's an embarrassment.
[00:25:27.395 --> 00:25:42.583]  But now those same Democrats face a real investigation laser-focused on their coup, as the hope of a nation hangs on the findings of Attorney General Barr and his bulldog investigator John Durham, fueled by Providence.
[00:25:42.583 --> 00:25:55.411]  I think the heart of the IG's report really focused on how the investigation was conducted once it got going, and that is especially the very serious abuses of Pfizer that occurred.
[00:25:55.951 --> 00:26:01.554]  Much of which has been, in my view, not accurately reported by the press over the last day.
[00:26:01.554 --> 00:26:07.697]  As far as I'm aware, this is the first time in history that this has been done to a presidential campaign.
[00:26:07.697 --> 00:26:13.220]  The use of these counterintelligence techniques against a presidential campaign.
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:24.866]  The long-awaited Inspector General report detailing Bill Priestap's opening of the investigation of the Trump campaign, known as Crossfire Hurricane, was largely deemed a dud.
[00:26:25.126 --> 00:26:37.950]  But there are plenty of takeaways that suggest that IG Horowitz's report was merely an appetizer and cast a very small net, mainly due to the restrictions of the IG office.
[00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:50.895]  Based on the evidence collected to date, and while our investigation is ongoing, last month we advised the Inspector General that we do not agree with some of the report's conclusion as to predication and how the FBI case was opened.
[00:26:51.175 --> 00:26:56.238]  Horowitz had no access to people at the CIA, Joseph Mifsud, any of those people.
[00:26:56.238 --> 00:27:09.387]  To reach the conclusion he did about the basis for the investigation without knowing about Mifsud and all those people, which Durham does, Durham felt he had to slap Horowitz right across the face publicly.
[00:27:09.387 --> 00:27:11.048]  That's quite embarrassing for Horowitz.
[00:27:11.048 --> 00:27:17.332]  That is a rebuke like I have never seen of an Inspector General by a United States Attorney.
[00:27:17.332 --> 00:27:19.413]  However, the IG report
[00:27:19.693 --> 00:27:31.976]  Did illuminate on the fact that we still don't know who paid for and directed the spy ring that proceeded and continued throughout the FBI's crossfire hurricane investigation.
[00:27:31.976 --> 00:27:43.639]  Exculpatory evidence was also withheld as the Democrats sought the initial FISA warrant, while emails were doctored to prove their fraudulent case to investigate the Trump campaign.
[00:27:43.939 --> 00:27:53.722]  The IG report also reveals that the key subsource for the Steele dossier was misquoted and he or she's words were exaggerated.
[00:27:53.722 --> 00:27:58.564]  All of these actions reveal bias and abuse of power on its face.
[00:27:58.564 --> 00:28:07.106]  Inspector General Horowitz doesn't have the power to investigate the origins and bad actors within the still hidden spy ring.
[00:28:07.106 --> 00:28:12.108]  But Attorney General Barr and John Durham can turn over every rock in their purview
[00:28:12.388 --> 00:28:18.015]  I think when you step back here and say, what was this all based on?
[00:28:18.015 --> 00:28:19.457]  It's not sufficient.
[00:28:19.457 --> 00:28:26.665]  Remember, there was and never has been any evidence of collusion and yet this
[00:28:27.346 --> 00:28:37.592]  The campaign and the president's administration has been dominated by this investigation into what turns out to be completely faceless.
[00:28:37.592 --> 00:28:52.260]  Add to that the discovery that will explode from the upcoming Carter Page lawsuit as the Democrats' day of impeachment meets the full wrath of a nation that has had enough.
[00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.421]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.301]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:00.301 --> 00:29:05.603]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:05.603 --> 00:29:07.203]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:07.203 --> 00:29:15.546]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:15.546 --> 00:29:21.248]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:21.548 --> 00:29:21.929]  I don't know.
[00:29:39.989 --> 00:29:44.151]  Order your two month supply today by calling 8 6 6 2 9 5 5 3 0 5.
[00:29:44.151 --> 00:29:48.033]  That's 8 6 6 2 9 5 5 3 0 5.
[00:29:48.033 --> 00:29:56.938]  Or order online HB extract dot com heart and body extract 8 6 6 2 9 5 5 3 0 5 or HB extract dot com.
[00:29:59.116 --> 00:30:02.338]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[00:30:02.338 --> 00:30:19.751]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:21.091]  We're being taken off the land.
[00:30:21.932 --> 00:30:32.601]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[00:30:32.601 --> 00:30:41.729]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[00:30:42.469 --> 00:30:45.834]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[00:30:45.834 --> 00:30:50.320]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.182]  This is the post-human error.
[00:30:52.182 --> 00:30:54.946]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[00:30:54.946 --> 00:30:56.408]  This is the crossroads.
[00:30:56.408 --> 00:30:58.230]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[00:30:59.321 --> 00:31:00.161]  Andy in Florida.
[00:31:00.161 --> 00:31:00.722]  Thank you, Andy.
[00:31:00.722 --> 00:31:01.802]  Go ahead.
[00:31:01.802 --> 00:31:02.462]  Hey, Alex.
[00:31:02.462 --> 00:31:03.222]  I love you, man.
[00:31:03.222 --> 00:31:03.862]  We love you.
[00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:07.704]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic at hand, I gotta talk about one of your products.
[00:31:07.704 --> 00:31:08.524]  A little bit about me.
[00:31:08.524 --> 00:31:09.984]  I'm 245 pounds.
[00:31:09.984 --> 00:31:13.005]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[00:31:13.005 --> 00:31:16.306]  And to make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[00:31:16.306 --> 00:31:20.788]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[00:31:21.288 --> 00:31:21.648]  I think so.
[00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:39.250]  We're really proud of TurboForce, so thank you, sir.

[00:33:25.397 --> 00:33:34.106]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.106 --> 00:33:36.468]  It is Wednesday, December 11, 2019.
[00:33:36.468 --> 00:33:41.513]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:41.513 --> 00:33:45.337]  And this country is fighting for its life, but at least we're fighting.
[00:33:46.618 --> 00:34:07.083]  And think about how far we've come with the deep state and world government and the globalists, who even denied their existence for decades as they took control, are now admitting they've got a planetary world government, and admitting they want to break our families up, and admitting they want to do all these horrible things to us for our own good.
[00:34:07.083 --> 00:34:09.544]  Admitting that they're pedophiles.
[00:34:09.544 --> 00:34:11.204]  Admitting that they're eugenicists.
[00:34:12.401 --> 00:34:14.422]  Admitting that they want a post-human world.
[00:34:14.422 --> 00:34:19.145]  Now, more and more, we're forcing these vampires out into the light.
[00:34:19.145 --> 00:34:29.731]  Thanks to you, the Vanguard, the audience of activists, the men and women in the arena that support Infowars, that spread the word about Infowars, that are the Infowar.
[00:34:29.731 --> 00:34:31.372]  You are the Infowar.
[00:34:31.372 --> 00:34:36.835]  And this crew, they are what makes it all possible.
[00:34:36.835 --> 00:34:39.217]  Just as much as myself and all of you together.
[00:34:41.715 --> 00:34:44.217]  And I'll tell you, I'm genuinely pissed about the globalists.
[00:34:44.217 --> 00:34:49.099]  I mean, this confirms our worst analysis, and then some.
[00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:51.221]  And we just can't sit here and put up with this.
[00:34:51.221 --> 00:34:56.004]  We have to get indignant and angry and focused, and then active.
[00:34:56.004 --> 00:34:58.365]  And we're going to turn this around.
[00:34:58.365 --> 00:34:59.466]  And the globalists know that.
[00:34:59.466 --> 00:35:08.731]  That's why they're trying to overwhelm us and get us to habituate to accept the collage and then the collapse of civilization.
[00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:09.532]  Let me just do this.
[00:35:11.015 --> 00:35:17.921]  Before I play more of these clips, let me just read to you some of the headlines we've got here.
[00:35:17.921 --> 00:35:21.424]  Monkey-pig hybrids created by Chinese scientists.
[00:35:21.424 --> 00:35:23.205]  London Independent.
[00:35:23.205 --> 00:35:27.008]  You're like, man, we heard that 20 years ago here.
[00:35:27.008 --> 00:35:32.553]  And again, it wasn't because I was a time traveler.
[00:35:32.553 --> 00:35:37.317]  It was going on then in medical level PhD reports.
[00:35:39.585 --> 00:35:54.225]  And then we would make a phone call, get the right person on who didn't realize what they were doing, and I'd have a scientist on that was, you know, creating, you know, goat spider creatures.
[00:35:54.225 --> 00:35:56.669]  I mean, we got the head of HAARP on one time.
[00:35:58.462 --> 00:36:02.763]  And then an Air Force colonel cut in and cut the interview off on air.
[00:36:02.763 --> 00:36:04.184]  By the way, we can't even find that.
[00:36:04.184 --> 00:36:05.944]  That's like 16 years ago.
[00:36:05.944 --> 00:36:11.326]  Just, it's insane the providence this broadcast has had.
[00:36:11.326 --> 00:36:18.028]  The problem is, is that we were such a ragtag group then that we can't find any of that.
[00:36:18.028 --> 00:36:25.271]  I have a director, the civilian director of Harpon, admitting weather control, over-the-horizon radar, how they can ignite the atmosphere.
[00:36:26.988 --> 00:36:34.775]  How the Air Force sprays out chemicals into the air to energize the fields they use.
[00:36:34.775 --> 00:36:42.443]  And then an Air Force colonel cut in, John Harmon was running the show back when that happened, during the break, and said, this interview's ending.
[00:36:42.443 --> 00:36:47.087]  And I took them live on air for about 30 seconds, and then they disconnected the line.
[00:36:47.087 --> 00:36:52.192]  They were on the line, not just listening, on the line.
[00:37:03.114 --> 00:37:05.595]  I have the civilian head on and I'm not trying to brag.
[00:37:05.595 --> 00:37:07.436]  I'm saying this is the insanity.
[00:37:07.436 --> 00:37:08.896]  This is real, folks.
[00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:11.017]  Okay?
[00:37:11.017 --> 00:37:20.081]  I have the director of Harpon talking about how they ignite the atmosphere with these antennas.
[00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:25.663]  They can turn the atmosphere into fire.
[00:37:25.663 --> 00:37:28.024]  The former CIA director gets up on
[00:37:29.324 --> 00:37:37.548]  C-SPAN admits they've got a giant planetary world government treaty for weather modification.
[00:37:37.548 --> 00:37:40.029]  And I can't even get the average person to even care.
[00:37:40.029 --> 00:37:42.310]  It's like, oh, that's a conspiracy!
[00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:44.250]  We heard that's not true.
[00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.512]  The news said so.
[00:37:47.512 --> 00:37:54.415]  The same news that said that Owen Schroyer said that he was going to hang Obama in the impeachment hearing.
[00:37:55.174 --> 00:37:56.134]  He didn't say that.
[00:37:56.134 --> 00:37:58.135]  He didn't say Obama's name.
[00:37:58.135 --> 00:38:01.717]  Everybody saw the video.
[00:38:01.717 --> 00:38:02.577]  I told my wife about it.
[00:38:02.577 --> 00:38:03.137]  She goes, really?
[00:38:03.137 --> 00:38:03.618]  Who said that?
[00:38:03.618 --> 00:38:06.179]  I go, Vanity Fair, CBS News.
[00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:06.899]  And I sort of shown her.
[00:38:06.899 --> 00:38:09.540]  She goes, this is crazy.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.881]  She'd seen the clip on the news before I even got home that day.
[00:38:12.881 --> 00:38:14.602]  Monday.
[00:38:14.602 --> 00:38:15.602]  She goes, I saw the whole clip.
[00:38:15.602 --> 00:38:16.563]  He didn't even talk about Obama.
[00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:21.080]  And she was freaked out, because you should be freaked out, folks.
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:30.965]  Then they went further, they said he wore a suit, a tailored suit, and that he likes Richard Spencer and is a white supremacist, with no link, no proof.
[00:38:30.965 --> 00:38:41.250]  So now, not just the brofist, not just the okay symbol, Fox News is reporting that SJW is an attack on Jews.
[00:38:47.125 --> 00:38:48.846]  But we were showing that video last night from Fox.
[00:38:48.846 --> 00:38:50.527]  Can we find that?
[00:38:50.527 --> 00:38:50.967]  If we can.
[00:38:50.967 --> 00:38:55.210]  The crew was up until 10 last night doing a special broadcast covering Trump's live.
[00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:55.510]  Live.
[00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.912]  Now there it is.
[00:38:57.912 --> 00:38:58.872]  Secret code words.
[00:38:58.872 --> 00:39:01.614]  SJW means stingy Jew.
[00:39:01.614 --> 00:39:02.415]  No it doesn't.
[00:39:02.415 --> 00:39:04.276]  Snowflake means person of color.
[00:39:04.276 --> 00:39:06.697]  No it means you're a delicate snowflake.
[00:39:06.697 --> 00:39:10.340]  This is what MSNBC, Fox News, they're all doing this.
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.301]  Cuck is a lover of fat women.
[00:39:12.301 --> 00:39:13.662]  Everyone knows what a cuck is.
[00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:22.224]  A cuck is someone that is kept by their girlfriend or wife.
[00:39:22.224 --> 00:39:24.005]  They have another word for it.
[00:39:24.005 --> 00:39:27.727]  Begins with a P. It's a two-word.
[00:39:27.727 --> 00:39:34.950]  P and then W. Well, I mean, it's a family-friendly show, but I mean, it's a pussycat.
[00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.711]  Pussywhipped?
[00:39:37.711 --> 00:39:40.693]  You know, pussywhipped doesn't have anything to do with Jews.
[00:39:40.693 --> 00:39:42.914]  And neither does cuck, and neither does SJW.
[00:39:52.759 --> 00:39:55.820]  And you know, it doesn't even freak me out anymore when I see him lie at that level.
[00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:01.923]  I just ask myself, who the hell are these crazy people trying this level of lies?
[00:40:01.923 --> 00:40:10.807]  Comey put out tweets and then wrote articles that were published in the New York Times and USA Today and the Washington Post saying, see, Trump's a liar.
[00:40:10.807 --> 00:40:14.408]  He was never wiretapped.
[00:40:14.408 --> 00:40:19.530]  We never touched his wires.
[00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:20.671]  That's so insulting.
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:30.624]  Because they don't call it wires and they don't put taps on wires anymore for a long time.
[00:40:30.624 --> 00:40:35.006]  But again, the IG report says it was legitimate to spy on the president.
[00:40:35.006 --> 00:40:36.067]  That's a whitewash.
[00:40:36.067 --> 00:40:43.412]  He takes that and then lies to you and says no one ever spied on the president, period, by using word games.
[00:40:43.412 --> 00:40:46.954]  Does that not insult your intelligence?
[00:40:46.954 --> 00:40:48.455]  Does that not outrage you?
[00:40:48.455 --> 00:40:49.976]  Does that not piss you off?
[00:40:52.534 --> 00:40:54.555]  And then it just gets worse from there.
[00:40:54.555 --> 00:40:56.315]  I want to take your calls on this subject.
[00:40:56.315 --> 00:40:58.136]  I want to take your calls on the IG report.
[00:40:58.136 --> 00:41:00.317]  I want to take it on the impeachment.
[00:41:00.317 --> 00:41:01.857]  I want to take it on every angle of this.
[00:41:01.857 --> 00:41:04.018]  We've got a lot of big developments on every front you can imagine.
[00:41:04.018 --> 00:41:05.099]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:41:05.099 --> 00:41:05.359]  877-789-2539.
[00:41:05.359 --> 00:41:05.639]  877-789-Alex.
[00:41:05.639 --> 00:41:06.259]  First-time callers.
[00:41:06.259 --> 00:41:06.719]  Long-time callers.
[00:41:06.719 --> 00:41:07.419]  You agree.
[00:41:07.419 --> 00:41:08.200]  You disagree.
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:08.820]  Everybody's welcome.
[00:41:19.206 --> 00:41:21.108]  Let me just read the headlines in order.
[00:41:21.108 --> 00:41:21.948]  Trump Jr.
[00:41:21.948 --> 00:41:27.373]  Time Magazine picks marketing gimmick Greta over Hong Kong protesters.
[00:41:27.373 --> 00:41:30.776]  Absolutely.
[00:41:30.776 --> 00:41:35.661]  Tax Grinch's Sanders and Warren want to kill charitable Christmas giving.
[00:41:35.661 --> 00:41:37.743]  Yep, because that's what Christians give.
[00:41:37.743 --> 00:41:39.644]  Scum.
[00:41:39.644 --> 00:41:41.406]  Of course leftists never donate.
[00:41:41.406 --> 00:41:44.749]  Growing divide between Trump and McConnell over impeachment trial.
[00:41:44.749 --> 00:41:45.410]  We're going to get to that.
[00:41:46.254 --> 00:41:52.197]  Trump goes off on IG and rallies scum at the FBI destroyed the lives of many people.
[00:41:52.197 --> 00:41:57.240]  Mike Bloomberg trying to win converts in California gets an event with Jerry Brown.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.661]  He can't even get above 3%.
[00:41:58.661 --> 00:41:59.901]  What a joke.
[00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:05.264]  On impeachment Tuesday, Nancy Pelosi toasts the media at holiday party.
[00:42:05.264 --> 00:42:07.946]  I mean, this is just psychotic joke.
[00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:21.399]  Biden signals to aid that he would only serve a single term as everybody calls for him to step down because he can't even talk.
[00:42:21.399 --> 00:42:26.084]  Democrats impeachment charges say Trump betrayed the nation.
[00:42:26.084 --> 00:42:29.547]  When that's what they're all about is getting rid of the country that exists.
[00:42:29.547 --> 00:42:30.749]  And they wreck every city they control.
[00:42:32.096 --> 00:42:34.837]  Barr sees big tech probe coming soon.
[00:42:34.837 --> 00:42:39.819]  And he says, watch out, it's going to be criminal, not just civil.
[00:42:39.819 --> 00:42:40.659]  That's good news.
[00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:41.620]  We'll see that actually happens.
[00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:46.221]  Tucker Carlson and Matt Gaetz are exposing the 9-11 operations.
[00:42:46.221 --> 00:42:49.282]  General election of what's happening over in the UK.
[00:42:49.282 --> 00:42:51.163]  Huge news there.
[00:42:51.163 --> 00:42:52.183]  So much more.
[00:42:52.183 --> 00:42:53.944]  Your phone calls straight ahead.
[00:42:53.944 --> 00:42:54.644]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:42:54.644 --> 00:42:55.525]  Please spread the link.

[00:43:58.197 --> 00:44:01.418]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[00:44:01.418 --> 00:44:18.806]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[00:44:18.806 --> 00:44:21.027]  We're being taken off the land.
[00:44:21.027 --> 00:44:26.530]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery.
[00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:44.109]  Until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human, then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God, believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly beg for them to implement against us.
[00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:49.392]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[00:44:49.392 --> 00:44:51.233]  This is the post-human error.
[00:44:51.233 --> 00:44:54.014]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[00:44:54.014 --> 00:44:55.475]  This is the crossroads.
[00:44:55.475 --> 00:44:57.296]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[00:44:59.215 --> 00:45:10.921]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:20.406]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[00:45:20.406 --> 00:45:24.988]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:26.729]  The globalists have literally sold their
[00:45:26.809 --> 00:45:27.209]  We're good.
[00:45:49.132 --> 00:45:51.716]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[00:45:51.716 --> 00:45:54.821]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[00:45:54.821 --> 00:45:58.247]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[00:46:00.123 --> 00:46:11.590]  Christmas is here, and it's time to give yourself, your family, and your loved ones the gift of having incredible energy, stamina, focus, libido.
[00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:15.632]  Now, look, there are a lot of stimulants out there that'll give you that for a while, but then burn you out.
[00:46:15.632 --> 00:46:20.475]  But if you have the foundation of what your body needs, then it takes you to the next level.
[00:46:21.155 --> 00:46:26.418]  Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus are total game-changing formulas.
[00:46:26.418 --> 00:46:30.320]  Then you add to that our BioTruth Selenium from the mustard seed.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:34.223]  It is the most powerful electro-transmitter in the body.
[00:46:34.223 --> 00:46:41.767]  And you put these products together, believe me, within just a few days, everybody that takes it feels an amazing response.
[00:46:41.767 --> 00:46:43.708]  This is serious business.
[00:46:43.708 --> 00:46:46.330]  It's 65% off Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:48.052]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:25.514]  This song... You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:47:25.514 --> 00:47:30.558]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:47:30.558 --> 00:47:33.180]  This song has never been more apropos.
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.723]  Listen to this great poetry.
[00:47:36.723 --> 00:47:39.445]  Listen to it.
[00:47:39.445 --> 00:47:41.227]  Riders on the storm.
[00:47:41.227 --> 00:47:42.708]  Riders on the storm.
[00:47:48.488 --> 00:47:52.649]  Into this house we're born.
[00:47:52.649 --> 00:47:56.269]  Into this world we're thrown.
[00:47:56.269 --> 00:47:57.410]  Into this house.
[00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:02.731]  Like a dog without a bone and actor out of love.
[00:48:02.731 --> 00:48:04.911]  Writers on the storm.
[00:48:04.911 --> 00:48:06.891]  Here's the most important part.
[00:48:06.891 --> 00:48:11.332]  There's a killer on the road.
[00:48:11.332 --> 00:48:13.352]  His brain is squirming like a toad.
[00:48:13.352 --> 00:48:15.333]  There's a killer on the road.
[00:48:18.865 --> 00:48:25.367]  Where you're trying to go with somebody waiting in the middle of that road.
[00:48:25.367 --> 00:48:31.009]  Trying to stop you.
[00:48:31.009 --> 00:48:35.291]  And if you pick up this vampire, you're gonna die.
[00:48:35.291 --> 00:48:37.792]  Yeah!
[00:48:37.792 --> 00:48:39.433]  You gotta say no.
[00:48:39.433 --> 00:48:40.293]  Don't let him in.
[00:48:40.293 --> 00:48:44.614]  You gotta say, get behind me Satan.
[00:48:44.614 --> 00:48:45.895]  Let your children play.
[00:48:49.602 --> 00:48:57.745]  You gotta take that holiday.
[00:48:57.745 --> 00:48:59.405]  Riders on the Storm.
[00:48:59.405 --> 00:49:03.546]  Alright, I'm gonna start going to your phone calls.
[00:49:03.546 --> 00:49:10.369]  Here, just a moment.
[00:49:10.369 --> 00:49:17.191]  If the system was smart, they would punish the corrupt.
[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:41.381]  They would give the public a bone, but they're not doing that, which only encourages the different legs of the power structure, the Democrats, the Neocons, the Deep State, the Chi-Com funders, to get more aggressive, more insane, more in everybody's face.
[00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:44.804]  Now, like I said yesterday and today, I got a headset problem.
[00:49:53.271 --> 00:49:58.476]  Let me play this clip before I go to your calls, because it illustrates what I was just talking about.
[00:49:58.476 --> 00:50:18.375]  When you look at this woman and you see the arrogance in her eyes, and you see her tone deafness and her disconnection from reality, with the cities that she and her cohorts control,
[00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:25.265]  And every nation that left his control collapsing.
[00:50:25.265 --> 00:50:27.726]  Because they're godless.
[00:50:27.726 --> 00:50:29.427]  That's what the Democrats are.
[00:50:29.427 --> 00:50:33.088]  It's who they are.
[00:50:33.088 --> 00:50:45.633]  But she's with pleasure, with a very satisfied look in her eyes, saying even if we don't remove Trump in the Senate, we're just going to impeach him again in 2020.
[00:50:48.837 --> 00:50:52.342]  And hopefully we'll have the Senate then and completely remove them.
[00:50:52.342 --> 00:51:04.641]  And they brought forward these hollow charges of obstructing Congress and of course of abuse of power because those are all in the eye of the beholder.
[00:51:06.795 --> 00:51:17.705]  It's just a definition that you yourself can make when they are the ones openly engaged in abuse of power, violating due process, violating the rules of Congress, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[00:51:17.705 --> 00:51:19.887]  They're the ones illegally spying on the journalists.
[00:51:19.887 --> 00:51:27.455]  They're the ones lying on forums to get warrants for investigations that are already ongoing.
[00:51:27.455 --> 00:51:30.097]  They're the ones that lied to Congress about what they were doing.
[00:51:30.097 --> 00:51:31.639]  They're the ones that had secret
[00:51:36.636 --> 00:51:40.359]  Dress rehearsals for what's now happening in the House.
[00:51:40.359 --> 00:51:48.364]  In the bowels of the intelligence bubble.
[00:51:48.364 --> 00:51:49.645]  So Democrat Rep.
[00:51:49.645 --> 00:51:55.389]  Cara Bass says House would impeach Trump again if he wins in 2020.
[00:51:55.389 --> 00:51:58.111]  You can just see the plan.
[00:51:58.111 --> 00:51:59.672]  Always intruding.
[00:51:59.672 --> 00:52:01.053]  Always forcing themselves in.
[00:52:01.053 --> 00:52:03.054]  Always dominating the discussion.
[00:52:03.054 --> 00:52:04.455]  Always on the offensive.
[00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:11.059]  Because the average American has been trained that that's just how life is.
[00:52:11.059 --> 00:52:12.420]  The left bullies you.
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.621]  They censor you.
[00:52:13.621 --> 00:52:14.842]  They scream at you.
[00:52:14.842 --> 00:52:16.403]  They tax you.
[00:52:16.403 --> 00:52:18.284]  And they have access to our children.
[00:52:18.284 --> 00:52:20.686]  And they run our lives.
[00:52:20.686 --> 00:52:24.709]  Because they're waddling stupid sacks of garbage.
[00:52:24.709 --> 00:52:28.271]  And so we have to bow to sacks of garbage.
[00:52:28.271 --> 00:52:31.813]  And we have to do whatever they say as they ruin everything they touch.
[00:52:31.813 --> 00:52:33.915]  Because somehow we think being cucked
[00:52:36.937 --> 00:52:38.138]  He's cool.
[00:52:38.138 --> 00:52:47.826]  Well, this audience of activists don't think it's cool, and that's why to call you an audience is an oxymoron.
[00:52:47.826 --> 00:52:58.754]  You are active, you are focused, you are engaged, you are supportive of the tip of the spear, you are the tip of the spear, and I just cannot lodge you enough to understand why they hate you is because you're what they fear.
[00:52:58.754 --> 00:53:03.118]  Awake, engaged, informed Americans that want justice and freedom and love God.
[00:53:04.178 --> 00:53:12.948]  And want to defend the children and aren't backing down and have a spirit of victory, not a spirit of fear.
[00:53:12.948 --> 00:53:19.435]  But at first I was proud of Owen standing up before Congress and pointing out the treason, the criminality, which even law professors have pointed out.
[00:53:19.435 --> 00:53:20.436]  I mean, it's on its face.
[00:53:20.436 --> 00:53:21.377]  It's incontrovertible.
[00:53:21.377 --> 00:53:22.378]  It's open and shut.
[00:53:22.378 --> 00:53:23.139]  It's not debatable.
[00:53:26.561 --> 00:53:35.185]  That this has been a legal process to replace another illegal process of the Russian gate, which they've brought back again all over the news.
[00:53:35.185 --> 00:53:42.448]  Because Trump dared meet with the Russian foreign minister, which is what you do.
[00:53:42.448 --> 00:53:51.491]  I mean, Kennedy traded sluts with the Russians.
[00:53:51.491 --> 00:53:53.512]  What do you think world leaders do when they actually make deals?
[00:53:53.512 --> 00:53:54.873]  They go party and get drunk.
[00:53:56.442 --> 00:53:58.023]  What do you think Eisenhower did with the Russians?
[00:53:58.023 --> 00:54:00.385]  What do you think Reagan did?
[00:54:00.385 --> 00:54:06.471]  What do you think all these people do?
[00:54:06.471 --> 00:54:10.114]  But Trump has him in the Oval Office.
[00:54:10.114 --> 00:54:12.156]  And I'm going to play the clip coming up later.
[00:54:12.156 --> 00:54:15.338]  They literally say, look, he's a Russian agent.
[00:54:15.338 --> 00:54:16.920]  He had the Russian behind him.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:20.603]  You can't trust a Russian behind you.
[00:54:20.603 --> 00:54:21.364]  Wait till I play this.
[00:54:22.654 --> 00:54:23.756]  But this is who they are.
[00:54:23.756 --> 00:54:24.818]  This is what they've become.
[00:54:24.818 --> 00:54:26.240]  This is what they do.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:33.173]  Here she is on TMZ with extreme relish talking about their plan to continue to obstruct based on lies.
[00:54:33.173 --> 00:54:33.473]  Here it is.
[00:54:34.292 --> 00:54:40.593]  Even though we're impeaching him now, there's still a number of court cases.
[00:54:40.593 --> 00:54:43.454]  There's a ton of information that could come forward.
[00:54:43.454 --> 00:54:50.495]  For example, we could get his bank records and find out that he's owned 100% by the Russians.
[00:54:50.495 --> 00:55:02.938]  So you are absolutely right in your scenario, but the only thing I would say slightly different is that it might not be the same articles of impeachment because the odds are we'd have a ton more information, and then the odds of
[00:55:03.038 --> 00:55:11.661]  That sadly enough is, is that, you know, he probably has other examples of criminal behavior.
[00:55:11.661 --> 00:55:20.584]  And again, when I walk down the street in Los Angeles or Austin, Texas or New York, people pull over and they go, F you Russian, you're going to prison.
[00:55:20.584 --> 00:55:24.145]  And these are men, glaring faces like they're ready to fight and I can't help it.
[00:55:24.145 --> 00:55:26.046]  I turn around and I go, let's go!
[00:55:27.116 --> 00:55:36.480]  And they always back down, but I mean, you know, you're saying you're going to prison, I'm going to get you a Russian agent, and you've seen it on video, I turn around and go, let's go!
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:43.223]  But, what about Devin Nunes, when they corner him, or people with their families?
[00:55:43.223 --> 00:55:51.446]  He just sits up there, that sack of garbage, looting California, and just goes, oh, we'll find out he's a Russian, we'll get rid of him in 2020, he's a Russian.
[00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.021]  Well, you're a pedophile enabler, lady.
[00:55:57.021 --> 00:55:58.161]  That's the Democrat Party.
[00:55:58.161 --> 00:56:00.222]  You're a baby killer.
[00:56:00.222 --> 00:56:01.882]  You're a piece of trash, and that's all true.
[00:56:01.882 --> 00:56:07.704]  And you got God to deal with, you sack of garbage.
[00:56:07.704 --> 00:56:10.005]  We're going to go on a break.
[00:56:10.005 --> 00:56:11.986]  We're going to take your calls.
[00:56:11.986 --> 00:56:13.886]  Got several guests joining us as well.
[00:56:13.886 --> 00:56:18.688]  Got a guest that's in the UK, a reporter, Lee Stranahan, with huge news on the giant election that starts tomorrow.
[00:56:20.282 --> 00:56:26.848]  Please remember that we've got the biggest sales going at Infowarstore.com in the 12 days of Christmas.
[00:56:26.848 --> 00:56:32.413]  Each day as the new sales come in, they just stack on top of each other.
[00:56:32.413 --> 00:56:36.637]  So day one was Monday, super blue, toothpaste at 50% off.
[00:56:36.637 --> 00:56:41.201]  It's got the tea tree, the colloidal silver, the iodine, fluoride free.
[00:56:41.201 --> 00:56:41.742]  It's amazing.
[00:56:43.188 --> 00:56:44.469]  Day 2 of the Stackling Show.
[00:56:44.469 --> 00:56:45.390]  This is still ongoing.
[00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:48.512]  Rainforest Plus, the great nootropic.
[00:56:48.512 --> 00:56:49.553]  60% off while supplies last.
[00:56:49.553 --> 00:56:52.916]  That's going to have to end soon, because supplies are getting low.
[00:56:52.916 --> 00:56:58.860]  Knockout, the amazing sleep aid that has eight different no natural compounds that synergistically work together to give you clean, deep, healthy sleep.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:00.342]  People love it.
[00:57:00.342 --> 00:57:05.285]  This latest batch has been really, really strong because it's organic, so it varies batch to batch like anything that's real.
[00:57:05.285 --> 00:57:05.946]  Knockout, 60% off.
[00:57:09.352 --> 00:57:11.155]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:11.155 --> 00:57:14.219]  We also have 67% off Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:57:14.219 --> 00:57:15.481]  I want to explain something.
[00:57:15.481 --> 00:57:17.924]  We're going to sell out of this by the end of the year.
[00:57:17.924 --> 00:57:21.489]  I might not get more into probably March.
[00:57:21.489 --> 00:57:26.155]  But I want those of you on the fence that haven't experienced what's in Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:57:27.628 --> 00:57:28.609]  To see what it does.
[00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:31.910]  Or what real, bio-true selenium from mustard seed does.
[00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:36.973]  So 67% off a real Redfield River Impulse Plus with a free bottle of bio-true selenium.

[00:59:58.342 --> 01:00:04.928]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.928 --> 01:00:05.428]  Coming up...
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.703]  FBI, ladies and gentlemen, is in a lot of trouble.
[01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:26.646]  Horowitz admits FBI engaged in illegal surveillance of Trump campaign.
[01:00:26.646 --> 01:00:27.987]  It's illegal surveillance.
[01:00:27.987 --> 01:00:30.429]  It's not court-authorized surveillance.
[01:00:30.429 --> 01:00:33.091]  That just happened in Congress.
[01:00:33.091 --> 01:00:37.935]  And I believe the report would be a whitewash.
[01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:39.336]  I was proven right.
[01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:42.178]  I was left things open on Durham and Barr.
[01:00:42.178 --> 01:00:47.663]  And watching closely, and my gut level analysis tells me they're very close to real action.
[01:00:49.477 --> 01:00:55.589]  And that there's a real civil war inside the deep state right now just over who's in control and that
[01:00:57.679 --> 01:01:04.063]  This is a time to be praying, because if we get back control of this country, it's going to change the whole destiny future of the species.
[01:01:04.063 --> 01:01:05.824]  This is a big, big deal.
[01:01:05.824 --> 01:01:12.849]  And our ancestors really fought hard to get us to where we're at, and we owe it to them and ourselves and our future progeny to stand up and do the right thing right now.
[01:01:12.849 --> 01:01:16.071]  But this is not a time to be sitting on the sidelines.
[01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:23.756]  OK, we've got Stuart, Peter, Carlos, Danny, Sam, Rob, Alex, Brian, Sergeant, John, Kyle, and others.
[01:01:23.756 --> 01:01:25.678]  We're taking calls throughout the broadcast today.
[01:01:27.295 --> 01:01:31.656]  And who should we go to first?
[01:01:31.656 --> 01:01:37.578]  Let's go ahead and take a call from John in Colorado.
[01:01:37.578 --> 01:01:38.819]  John, thanks for calling today.
[01:01:38.819 --> 01:01:40.319]  Welcome.
[01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:42.300]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.600]  You know, I've got mixed feelings.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.600]  People are really waking up.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:52.383]  The deep state's being exposed, but it's also still hanging on, and we see massive censorship and open pedophilia everywhere, so it's freaking me out.
[01:01:52.383 --> 01:01:52.883]  How are you doing?
[01:01:54.218 --> 01:01:59.460]  Well, I'm leaning more and more towards being blackmailed about the whole situation.
[01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:20.666]  I mean, the way I've been seeing it is if they can lie so boldly and capture the lowest IQ portion of the country into believing such garbage, even if the truth did come out and the deep state was held accountable, you'd have a huge percentage of the population that just refused to believe it.
[01:02:20.666 --> 01:02:22.166]  So I don't really see there being any
[01:02:23.354 --> 01:02:25.396]  Reasonable way out of this mess.
[01:02:25.396 --> 01:02:26.217]  Well, that's right.
[01:02:26.217 --> 01:02:28.620]  That's the paradox of freedom.
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:38.110]  Is that in its final phases, it creates so many dumb, stupid, lazy slobs who are poisoned by the fluoride and the vaccines and have, I mean, the new average IQ is 80 points.
[01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:39.471]  It's not 100 anymore.
[01:02:39.471 --> 01:02:44.456]  And these drooling masses believe whatever the establishment tells them and are coming for us.
[01:02:45.097 --> 01:02:47.599]  And so there's going to be a mass culling one way or the other.
[01:02:47.599 --> 01:02:52.123]  And I mean, that's really it, is that we killed 60 million babies.
[01:02:52.123 --> 01:02:53.544]  And now we kill babies after they're born.
[01:02:53.544 --> 01:02:55.205]  Now we kill old people.
[01:02:55.205 --> 01:02:58.948]  And you know, it's just coming towards a giant mass killing.
[01:02:58.948 --> 01:03:00.469]  It's not going to be us initiating it.
[01:03:00.469 --> 01:03:04.993]  But I mean, Democrat cities, if you go to them, are literally collapsing.
[01:03:05.353 --> 01:03:08.374]  I mean, I've been in third world countries that look better and operate better.
[01:03:08.374 --> 01:03:10.994]  I mean, there's open sewage running through Democrat cities.
[01:03:10.994 --> 01:03:13.795]  There's just needles everywhere, homeless people everywhere.
[01:03:13.795 --> 01:03:20.716]  The leadership of the Democrats all look like reanimated corpses that literally stumble around, demon possessed.
[01:03:20.716 --> 01:03:24.297]  I mean, this is a spiritual invasion happening.
[01:03:24.297 --> 01:03:32.178]  Yeah, I mean, there's no other way to explain it because up is down, right is wrong, left is right.
[01:03:33.055 --> 01:03:50.706]  I mean, everything turned upside down, and if you listen to any sort of, you know, religious representation of what they think will happen, I mean, it's pretty much just falling apart, and it'll... In the days of Noah, there were just literally demonic spirits turned loose.
[01:03:50.706 --> 01:04:01.253]  People went crazy, psychotic, and you read the Bible, you know, you read what happens in Genesis and other books, you think, that's crazy, and then it's happening now exactly as it says.
[01:04:02.185 --> 01:04:03.767]  Oh, it's like the Tower of Babel.
[01:04:03.767 --> 01:04:07.212]  It's just mayhem, madness, chaos.
[01:04:07.212 --> 01:04:07.993]  You know?
[01:04:07.993 --> 01:04:12.079]  One way or the other, either it's gonna work out in our favor.
[01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:14.523]  I mean, it's gonna work out in our favor.
[01:04:14.523 --> 01:04:15.544]  There's no way.
[01:04:15.544 --> 01:04:17.848]  Well, yeah, because it's about a spiritual relationship.
[01:04:18.547 --> 01:04:20.249]  The physical body is only one level.
[01:04:20.249 --> 01:04:21.711]  That's been scientifically proven now.
[01:04:21.711 --> 01:04:24.874]  I mean, there aren't any globalists that are atheists anymore.
[01:04:24.874 --> 01:04:28.118]  They all believe they're in contact with off-world aliens.
[01:04:28.118 --> 01:04:29.339]  We call them demons.
[01:04:29.339 --> 01:04:32.743]  They've made a deal for a post-human world to get rid of us.
[01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:34.865]  So, it's horrible what we've got to go through.
[01:04:35.891 --> 01:04:49.035]  World government, Mark of the Beast, all of it, but it's all foretold, it's all happening, and so we know how real this is, and thank God God's real, and our spirits are eternal, so we'll make the choice to go with God instead of Satan.
[01:04:49.035 --> 01:04:52.457]  That's the big choice, and that's the real red pill.
[01:04:52.457 --> 01:04:53.457]  Thank you so much, John.
[01:04:57.125 --> 01:04:58.986]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[01:04:58.986 --> 01:05:00.807]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[01:05:00.807 --> 01:05:03.749]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs.
[01:05:03.749 --> 01:05:04.349]  Spiritually.
[01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:06.370]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:07.911]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[01:05:09.557 --> 01:05:12.739]  In a fight where it's gonna have more power per dollar.
[01:05:40.058 --> 01:05:41.539]  I want to go after the globalists.
[01:05:41.539 --> 01:05:48.788]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[01:05:48.788 --> 01:05:54.696]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, because we're in this together!
[01:05:54.696 --> 01:05:55.877]  InfoWarsTore.com
[01:06:02.995 --> 01:06:04.896]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:04.896 --> 01:06:18.446]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:18.446 --> 01:06:26.252]  Well, the Inspector General's report was a whitewash.
[01:06:26.252 --> 01:06:31.776]  But, under oath, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:06:33.539 --> 01:06:36.182]  Another story is being told.
[01:06:36.182 --> 01:06:42.130]  Horowitz admits FBI engaged in illegal surveillance of Trump campaign.
[01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.351]  It's illegal surveillance.
[01:06:43.351 --> 01:06:46.835]  It's not court-authorized surveillance.
[01:06:46.835 --> 01:06:47.736]  This just came out.
[01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:52.843]  It's on Infowars.com and Newswars.com during Wednesday's Senate Judiciary.
[01:06:53.717 --> 01:06:54.297]  Let's play this out.
[01:06:54.297 --> 01:06:55.477]  They never told Trump about the concerns.
[01:06:55.477 --> 01:06:58.918]  Is it fair to say they came a point to where surveilling Carter Page became unlawful?
[01:07:19.651 --> 01:07:22.092]  Um, I will let the court decide that.
[01:07:22.092 --> 01:07:24.753]  The court has this report and will make that decision.
[01:07:24.753 --> 01:07:25.694]  Let's put it this way.
[01:07:25.694 --> 01:07:31.956]  If you don't have a legal foundation to surveil somebody and you keep doing it, is that bad?
[01:07:31.956 --> 01:07:33.357]  Absolutely.
[01:07:33.357 --> 01:07:35.458]  Is that spying?
[01:07:35.458 --> 01:07:36.778]  Um, it's, it's not.
[01:07:36.778 --> 01:07:38.319]  It's illegal surveillance.
[01:07:38.319 --> 01:07:39.720]  It's not court authorized surveillance.
[01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:42.641]  Whatever illegal surveillance means, they did it.
[01:07:44.679 --> 01:08:01.606]  So, all this stuff that they did in a legally surveilled Trump's campaign, they did because they had no legal basis after the January 2017 data dump by the Russian guy to believe that the dossier was reliable.
[01:08:01.606 --> 01:08:12.831]  They altered a sculptory information in June of 2017 that would have further proven that Carter Page is not a Russian agent, he was actually working with the CIA.
[01:08:12.831 --> 01:08:13.612]  Let me ask you a very
[01:08:14.272 --> 01:08:15.093]  Directly.
[01:08:15.093 --> 01:08:22.759]  Do you believe Carter Page is or ever was an agent of the Russian government trying to do harm to his country?
[01:08:22.759 --> 01:08:34.910]  I'm going to refer to the evidence we found here, which is that at the end of this, they, the FBI, at the end of these fizes, told us that they had found no.
[01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.031]  Told us they had found no.
[01:08:37.162 --> 01:08:46.990]  And then the clip cuts, we're getting the longer clip, but they go on, we have the transcript, said they found no evidence of Russian collusion or Russian infiltration of any of the people.
[01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:58.801]  And it turns out, as I said back at the time, not just Page, but all those guys were working for the CIA, and then it was a cover story
[01:09:00.563 --> 01:09:10.392]  When it later came out in the news that they were under investigation and things that they themselves were the target and that was just the cover.
[01:09:10.392 --> 01:09:23.883]  And then they were going out and seeking Russians to interface with, so that through them, it would then connect in to Trump.
[01:09:23.883 --> 01:09:25.525]  That was the mission, that was the plan.
[01:09:28.766 --> 01:09:33.147]  By this entire gaggle of individuals from the swamp.
[01:09:33.147 --> 01:09:39.988]  And I said back at the time, I believe that Page is probably a mole and probably working for the CIA.
[01:09:39.988 --> 01:09:43.069]  And I'm on record saying that.
[01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:47.330]  Now they've spun it like, oh, they knew he was innocent and still they did this to him.
[01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:50.991]  It's far worse than that, in my view, in my humble opinion.
[01:09:50.991 --> 01:09:52.931]  And we're still allowed to have those in America, aren't we?
[01:09:54.548 --> 01:10:02.915]  But that's why Fiona Hill and all of them were so pissed a couple years ago listening to my show, and knowing that Trump was getting intel from it, because it was dead on about all these people.
[01:10:02.915 --> 01:10:09.521]  I mean, you could see this coming from a mile away.
[01:10:09.521 --> 01:10:17.988]  And I had the Secret Service call me, and I had other agencies call me, and other agencies came and met with us, and I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:21.843]  And they said, how do you know Trump was being spied on?
[01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:22.704]  That's classified.
[01:10:22.704 --> 01:10:27.469]  And I said, the Democrats bragged when he was president-elect that they had wiretaps.
[01:10:27.469 --> 01:10:31.373]  There were damn headlines all over the news!
[01:10:31.373 --> 01:10:34.016]  I mean, it's the laziness of these government people.
[01:10:34.016 --> 01:10:36.298]  Because they're not just playing dumb, folks.
[01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:40.323]  And the whole theory of people are inept is true.
[01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:42.305]  Now the globalists on top use that ineptness.
[01:10:43.257 --> 01:10:48.339]  And I'm not saying everybody in the government's inept, but everybody knows how the general public is, how companies are, how everything is.
[01:10:48.339 --> 01:10:49.940]  People are in la-la land.
[01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:59.844]  People watch, on average, like five hours of TV a day, four hours of screen time on top of that, and everything's just kind of lackadaisical.
[01:10:59.844 --> 01:11:07.447]  And so people think I'm some type of rocket scientist, because
[01:11:09.548 --> 01:11:14.572]  I remember the news saying, oh we got Trump, he's a Russian.
[01:11:14.572 --> 01:11:18.054]  We were wiretapping the campaign, we were spying on it.
[01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:20.396]  And I got the Washington Post and the New York Times.
[01:11:20.396 --> 01:11:28.062]  When he was president-elect, and even the day he was sworn in, front page of the New York Times.
[01:11:34.807 --> 01:11:41.799]  Well, the President wanted us to give you a call and find out exactly who it is that's running this coup!
[01:11:41.799 --> 01:11:42.701]  I'm like, really, the President?
[01:11:42.701 --> 01:11:45.826]  Well, yeah, he wanted you to know that, the President, yes.
[01:11:45.826 --> 01:11:47.028]  We appreciate you talking to us, so...
[01:11:48.306 --> 01:11:50.208]  Who's planning to kill him or overthrow him?
[01:11:50.208 --> 01:11:50.909]  What do you mean by coup?
[01:11:50.909 --> 01:11:53.291]  And I said, they're running a coup.
[01:11:53.291 --> 01:11:54.232]  They're deep staters.
[01:11:54.232 --> 01:12:03.941]  Anybody who's a neocon or a Democrat in the State Department, anyone that's ever worked for Soros or the Clintons or Obama or Bush, senior or junior, he cannot have around him.
[01:12:03.941 --> 01:12:05.523]  They're running a stay-behind network.
[01:12:05.523 --> 01:12:05.943]  No, no, no.
[01:12:05.943 --> 01:12:07.344]  What's a stay-behind network?
[01:12:07.344 --> 01:12:10.087]  I might have an hour-long conversations with senior Secret Service.
[01:12:10.087 --> 01:12:11.849]  You don't know what a stay-behind network is.
[01:12:11.849 --> 01:12:13.010]  Okay, they're inbeds.
[01:12:14.482 --> 01:12:20.044]  They're networks of globalists that are going to undermine and set the President up, and they're going to overthrow him however they can.
[01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:29.907]  I mean, did you see on CNN when they said he won't be in the office by Christmas?
[01:12:29.907 --> 01:12:34.168]  Did you see him at the Aspen Institute, Clapper and Brennan?
[01:12:34.168 --> 01:12:38.150]  When Wolf Blitzer says, what do you mean you're going to remove him outside of impeachment?
[01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:40.491]  And they just make evil faces.
[01:12:40.491 --> 01:12:41.731]  That's a threat to the President.
[01:12:42.827 --> 01:12:45.510]  Now, years later, it's called a coup.
[01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:47.171]  Everybody knows that.
[01:12:47.171 --> 01:12:52.536]  But I didn't need to get a call from an intelligence operative.
[01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:59.863]  The millions of them the government's got, most of them just walk around playing golf and talking into their shirt and trying to impress their girlfriends.
[01:12:59.863 --> 01:13:02.125]  Oh, I've got a badge and a government security clearance.
[01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:03.547]  Whoop-dee-frickin'-do!
[01:13:03.547 --> 01:13:05.248]  How about you study every day?
[01:13:05.248 --> 01:13:06.870]  How about you research what's going on?
[01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:07.831]  How about you know history?
[01:13:09.192 --> 01:13:17.503]  And that's what's so frustrating about this is I became this big number one target all because I'm not lazy.
[01:13:17.503 --> 01:13:21.668]  And that's what's frustrating is it should be so easy to beat these people.
[01:13:21.668 --> 01:13:27.536]  But the average male in this country is beyond lazy, beyond uninformed, and beyond stupid.
[01:13:29.352 --> 01:13:29.992]  I talked to U.S.
[01:13:29.992 --> 01:13:32.754]  Senators off the record, Congress people on average, who are pretty good people.
[01:13:32.754 --> 01:13:34.434]  They still don't know anything.
[01:13:34.434 --> 01:13:39.557]  The fellow running the boom camera, who's worked in TV for decades, he knows as much as I do or more about all these subjects.
[01:13:39.557 --> 01:13:40.777]  We have long conversations.
[01:13:40.777 --> 01:13:42.278]  He knows everything.
[01:13:42.278 --> 01:13:45.500]  But all those people are just out there working hard in America.
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:52.403]  All the political class doesn't know which end is up and can't find their fat asses with both hands.
[01:13:52.403 --> 01:13:55.344]  And it scares the hell out of me.
[01:13:55.344 --> 01:13:57.525]  But you know who's got a hunger for power?
[01:13:57.525 --> 01:13:58.606]  Criminals and pedophiles.
[01:13:59.448 --> 01:14:05.113]  They have that criminal energy that good people don't have.
[01:14:05.113 --> 01:14:12.940]  They're working around the clock to get access to your children, and access to your bank accounts, and access to control in your life, because they crave it.
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:15.622]  And we need to start craving freedom.
[01:14:15.622 --> 01:14:22.628]  We need to start craving not being overrun by the globalists and their minions, and start getting territorial, and start getting pissed again.
[01:14:22.628 --> 01:14:25.931]  Because let me tell you,
[01:14:27.108 --> 01:14:34.953]  When I had all the girlfriends I wanted and having a great time and eating great food and working out all the time and, you know, I was not happy.
[01:14:34.953 --> 01:14:39.376]  When I started fighting tyranny 24-7, I'm so damn happy it makes my head spin.
[01:14:39.376 --> 01:14:41.137]  People are not fulfilled because they're empty.
[01:14:41.137 --> 01:14:42.317]  They don't have God.
[01:14:42.317 --> 01:14:43.518]  They don't have family.
[01:14:43.518 --> 01:14:46.360]  All they've got is Netflix!
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:50.042]  Well, man cannot live by Netflix alone.
[01:14:50.042 --> 01:14:52.484]  I'm gonna stop preaching and go to your phone calls when we come back.
[01:14:52.484 --> 01:14:53.284]  I promise.
[01:14:53.284 --> 01:14:55.386]  We got a guest popping in, but I'm gonna take calls throughout the broadcast.
[01:14:55.386 --> 01:14:56.006]  I'm gonna get to everybody.
[01:14:57.964 --> 01:15:01.286]  Already took one call.
[01:15:01.286 --> 01:15:03.347]  Just briefly, so I don't have to do it later.

[01:15:27.964 --> 01:15:29.665]  We got some of our shirts really good.
[01:15:29.665 --> 01:15:31.446]  Other people, I think, do make better stuff than us.
[01:15:31.446 --> 01:15:33.028]  It's just something we're not as good at.
[01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:33.568]  We're getting better.
[01:15:33.568 --> 01:15:38.332]  We have the new Alex Jones Don't Visit InfoWars meme shirt with laser beams shooting out of my eyes.
[01:15:38.332 --> 01:15:39.933]  I think that's a pretty good shirt.

[01:15:56.311 --> 01:15:58.272]  Heart disease is on the rise.

[01:20:00.406 --> 01:20:03.047]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:28.573]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.573 --> 01:20:29.814]  Well, that's pretty big news.
[01:20:29.814 --> 01:20:36.038]  Horowitz admits in congressional testimony in the Senate, FBI engaged in illegal surveillance of the Trump campaign.
[01:20:36.038 --> 01:20:36.779]  We already know that.
[01:20:39.679 --> 01:20:47.885]  So then why'd he say no wrongdoing, no criminal activity in his damn report?
[01:20:47.885 --> 01:20:52.949]  No, I'm the guy saying the report would be a nothing burger because they cover their ass.
[01:20:52.949 --> 01:21:04.938]  But Durham and Barr aren't just signaling, they're saying there's criminal investigations and they're taking action and that people have to be indicted.
[01:21:04.938 --> 01:21:09.382]  That shows you there's a real fight going on between these groups and they really legitimately hate each other.
[01:21:11.288 --> 01:21:13.689]  So that is a big, big deal.
[01:21:13.689 --> 01:21:14.670]  What do you think about that?
[01:21:14.670 --> 01:21:19.913]  What do you think about the impeachment and the tricks they've got up their sleeves?
[01:21:19.913 --> 01:21:25.357]  Are Democrats saying even if they don't get rid of Trump this time, if he gets re-elected, they're going to start it over again?
[01:21:25.357 --> 01:21:27.958]  They have to be repudiated.
[01:21:27.958 --> 01:21:33.742]  They absolutely have to be repudiated.
[01:21:33.742 --> 01:21:38.225]  And they've got to be defeated.
[01:21:38.225 --> 01:21:39.445]  They've got to lose the House.
[01:21:39.445 --> 01:21:40.206]  They've got to lose
[01:21:43.106 --> 01:21:52.451]  Control of the governorships they have, but instead they're starting to gain seats because Trump's allowed the censorship and the election fraud.
[01:21:52.451 --> 01:21:57.793]  And I just hate seeing everybody so happy about Trump and so pleased with the job he's doing.
[01:21:57.793 --> 01:22:10.459]  And average pensions at the border are down 60 plus percent and Trump is going after the pedophile rings and he is in a real trade war with China and he is trying to get the Federal Reserve to have policies that kickstart the economy.
[01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:11.400]  I mean, Trump's the real deal.
[01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:15.072]  Which shows you there's not just pure evil in the world.
[01:22:15.072 --> 01:22:20.316]  Hell, this audience got him elected.
[01:22:20.316 --> 01:22:24.820]  But it just begs the question, are we gonna watch him take it all away from us?
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.722]  Because they don't get in trouble for what they've done.
[01:22:27.722 --> 01:22:32.866]  Because in the blue cities they get control of, there's never real elections again.
[01:22:32.866 --> 01:22:39.631]  And they collapse society and loot it by design.
[01:22:39.631 --> 01:22:41.693]  Sergeant in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:22:42.793 --> 01:22:45.494]  Hey Alex, it's great to talk to you again.
[01:22:45.494 --> 01:22:49.056]  I've been listening to you since I was in the military.
[01:22:49.056 --> 01:22:51.217]  I was in the Marine Corps.
[01:22:51.217 --> 01:23:05.523]  I actually called you back then when I was in, back when I got back from Iraq and told you, you know, basically you guys were right about everything that we were reporting on as far as like the fake wars and fake WMDs and all that stuff.
[01:23:05.523 --> 01:23:09.905]  And you've always been a household name in my house, even to
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.000]  Thank you, sir.
[01:23:41.691 --> 01:23:43.833]  What was I thinking?
[01:23:43.833 --> 01:23:50.159]  So, I mean, that instrumental, it alone is instrumental in the fight.
[01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:53.342]  You are the one that woke me up.
[01:23:53.342 --> 01:23:56.384]  And about the deep state thing, I never heard about it until Trump got elected.
[01:23:56.384 --> 01:24:03.351]  And especially during the election, I caught so much heat from you, from people that were living on the coast.
[01:24:03.351 --> 01:24:04.912]  I live on the West Coast.
[01:24:04.912 --> 01:24:06.614]  I'm originally from the Midwest, Indiana.
[01:24:07.358 --> 01:24:26.429]  I live on the West Coast now, and I was talking to people on the East Coast, because I know some people over there in New York, and man, they hate your guts, they hate Trump, and all this and that, and Roger Stone, and they're very little trickster, and blah blah blah, and laughing and giggling and stuff when things are going down at that point, but they all blocked me on Facebook.
[01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:33.672]  I'm on my fifth month of banning on Facebook this year alone for, you know, speaking my mind.
[01:24:35.998 --> 01:24:49.209]  I saw the hearing this morning with Dianne Feinstein asking Horowitz, asked him three times, is there a deep state and was there a political motivation for opening the investigation?
[01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:57.677]  And all three times, Horowitz said there was no political motivation and he dodged the deep state question.
[01:24:57.677 --> 01:24:59.378]  Three times, dodged the question.
[01:24:59.378 --> 01:25:01.120]  He did not answer the deep state question.
[01:25:01.966 --> 01:25:03.528]  Elaborate a little bit for us, Sergeant.
[01:25:20.933 --> 01:25:26.415]  When you talk about feeling vindicated, being vindicated, people around you saying, yeah, you were right.
[01:25:26.415 --> 01:25:27.955]  Because that's what I'm seeing happen.
[01:25:27.955 --> 01:25:31.677]  That's why they wanted us off the air before all this began to come out.
[01:25:31.677 --> 01:25:33.877]  And they failed miserably.
[01:25:33.877 --> 01:25:38.539]  That's why people out there that are censored have to understand, you're censored because you're telling the truth.
[01:25:38.539 --> 01:25:41.880]  And as they censor more, the truth becomes even more precious.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.861]  And people dig for it like jewels in the mountainside.
[01:25:46.734 --> 01:25:51.356]  So as this evil intensifies, and as we're proven right, we become more powerful, folks.
[01:25:51.356 --> 01:25:54.618]  That's why they're having to censor, which only exposes them more.
[01:25:54.618 --> 01:25:56.079]  That's an act of desperation.
[01:25:56.079 --> 01:26:02.821]  So give us your boots on the ground, a little bit of elaboration, why you're saying people now say we're vindicated.
[01:26:02.821 --> 01:26:05.943]  Because that's what I'm seeing happen.
[01:26:05.943 --> 01:26:07.043]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:07.043 --> 01:26:11.585]  So when I was in the Marine Corps, I was a platoon sergeant for roughly 30 to 40 Marines.
[01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:23.137]  Every day during the daily morning accountability formation, you know, I would pass on news and in the evening accountability formation, I would pass on the news of the day that you had.
[01:26:23.137 --> 01:26:30.723]  And a lot of it had to do with the time because you were really harping on the devices in the televisions and in the things that would listen if a dog barked.
[01:26:30.723 --> 01:26:34.706]  You know, you had a, you know, you had a dog commercial come on and now we're seeing it on our phones.
[01:26:35.736 --> 01:26:38.977]  And, you know, my Marines would tell me all the time, Sergeant, you're crazy.
[01:26:38.977 --> 01:26:45.058]  And, like, you know, my higher-ups, you know, my superiors would tell me, Sergeant, you need to shut your mouth.
[01:26:45.058 --> 01:26:46.298]  There's no place for this here.
[01:26:46.298 --> 01:26:46.918]  We don't need it.
[01:26:46.918 --> 01:26:48.939]  It's a waste of time.
[01:26:48.939 --> 01:26:57.920]  And now, here we are, you know, 10 years later, and I'm out, and I have all my Marines contacting me going, holy crap, Sergeant, you were right.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:01.541]  You know, everything you told us is coming true.
[01:27:01.541 --> 01:27:02.081]  How'd you know?
[01:27:03.143 --> 01:27:04.183]  And I always drop your name.
[01:27:04.183 --> 01:27:05.064]  Remember Alex Jones?
[01:27:05.064 --> 01:27:07.364]  And they're like, oh yeah.
[01:27:07.364 --> 01:27:09.965]  OK, now it's coming together.
[01:27:09.965 --> 01:27:15.147]  And by the way, brother, that's the only way we're going to stay on air is that word of mouth.
[01:27:15.147 --> 01:27:17.647]  And now more than ever, people have to hear that information.
[01:27:17.647 --> 01:27:21.609]  I know what I'm stating is obvious, but again, that's why listeners have to understand.
[01:27:21.609 --> 01:27:23.009]  You are beyond critical.
[01:27:23.009 --> 01:27:24.629]  You are the only hope we've got.
[01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:26.030]  And by the way, you're an incredible hope.
[01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:34.095]  You are victory, you are the info war, so keep it up, because now people have to hear the other information, the next side of the equation.
[01:27:34.095 --> 01:27:41.440]  Sounds even crazier, but it's all going to be revealed, and it's all going to be coming out in the open, and so that's why it's so important.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:45.523]  But yeah, the normal response when you're being illegally listened to by appliances
[01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:46.423]  Yes.
[01:28:03.255 --> 01:28:15.003]  And is going to be misused against everybody that we need to be honest about that the architecture has been built wrongly with back doors to abuse everyone by the satanic global deep state that is the new world order.
[01:28:15.003 --> 01:28:20.327]  Because there's not just the American deep state, there is a worldwide planetary satanic deep state.
[01:28:20.327 --> 01:28:25.210]  Our deep state is only one tentacle of this creature.
[01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:30.914]  Just like in the Stephen King novel, it the clown is just the anglerfish's finger that it dangles out there.
[01:28:30.914 --> 01:28:32.134]  And so that's an amazing thing.
[01:28:32.134 --> 01:28:32.915]  Thank you, Sergeant.
[01:28:33.576 --> 01:28:35.698]  Wow, we spent a whole segment with him, but he was a great caller.
[01:28:35.698 --> 01:28:36.739]  You're all great.
[01:28:36.739 --> 01:28:38.120]  We're going to get to everybody here.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:43.345]  I appreciate everyone listening on this live Wednesday broadcast.

[01:28:46.789 --> 01:28:48.471]  Newswars.com forward slash show.
[01:28:48.471 --> 01:28:49.011]  Share that link.
[01:28:49.011 --> 01:28:52.294]  It takes them right to all the audio and video feeds, which is a revolutionary act.
[01:28:52.294 --> 01:28:52.655]  Stay with us.
[01:28:56.069 --> 01:28:57.270]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.270 --> 01:29:01.192]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.192 --> 01:29:02.733]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.733 --> 01:29:05.695]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.695 --> 01:29:11.258]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.258 --> 01:29:12.458]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:12.458 --> 01:29:15.400]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:17.621]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.621 --> 01:29:22.064]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:22.064 --> 01:29:24.345]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:25.686 --> 01:29:29.568]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:29.568 --> 01:29:34.551]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[01:29:34.551 --> 01:29:39.373]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:39.373 --> 01:29:40.714]  Don't just take my word for it.
[01:29:40.714 --> 01:29:44.496]  Check out all of the success stories at HBExtract.com.
[01:29:44.496 --> 01:29:45.457]  Or to order, call 866-295-5305.
[01:29:45.457 --> 01:29:45.857]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:29:45.857 --> 01:29:46.417]  HBExtract.com.
[01:29:46.417 --> 01:29:48.698]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:56.914 --> 01:29:59.295]  It's time to take yourself to the next level.
[01:29:59.295 --> 01:30:03.816]  It doesn't matter if you're a man, it doesn't matter if you're a woman, it doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[01:30:03.816 --> 01:30:08.677]  As you age, preglanone levels in the body go down.
[01:30:08.677 --> 01:30:21.341]  Now in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglanone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis, and then it just gets wilder from there.
[01:30:22.081 --> 01:30:22.181]  Yes.
[01:30:39.417 --> 01:30:40.017]  We're good to go.
[01:30:57.268 --> 01:31:00.489]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[01:31:00.489 --> 01:31:17.876]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[01:31:17.876 --> 01:31:19.237]  We're being taken off the land.
[01:31:20.097 --> 01:31:30.742]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[01:31:30.742 --> 01:31:39.866]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[01:31:40.626 --> 01:31:43.988]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[01:31:43.988 --> 01:31:48.470]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:50.331]  This is the post-human error.
[01:31:50.331 --> 01:31:53.093]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[01:31:53.093 --> 01:31:54.554]  This is the crossroads.
[01:31:54.554 --> 01:31:57.115]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[01:31:57.115 --> 01:32:00.597]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[01:32:00.597 --> 01:32:01.638]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[01:32:02.538 --> 01:32:08.843]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better, and that's taking care of our individual health.
[01:32:08.843 --> 01:32:24.636]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to infowarestore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life-changing in what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health.
[01:32:25.236 --> 01:32:30.920]  Your stamina, your libido, but then of course it also funds the Infowar that is so incredibly critical.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:36.204]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that it's a true 360 win?
[01:32:36.204 --> 01:32:44.651]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[01:32:44.651 --> 01:32:52.397]  Spend your money on high-quality products and have huge savings and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at InfowarStore.com.
[01:32:52.397 --> 01:32:54.238]  That's InfowarStore.com.
[01:32:54.238 --> 01:32:55.139]  Please make the right choice.
[01:32:59.906 --> 01:33:02.530]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:19.958 --> 01:33:21.158]  You've found it.
[01:33:21.158 --> 01:33:23.199]  The tip of the spear.
[01:33:23.199 --> 01:33:29.601]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.601 --> 01:33:31.022]  So let's play this out.
[01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:34.043]  They never told Trump about the concerns.
[01:33:34.043 --> 01:33:41.125]  Is it fair to say there came a point to where surveilling Carter Page became unlawful?
[01:33:44.335 --> 01:33:45.895]  I will let the court decide that.
[01:33:45.895 --> 01:33:48.557]  The court has this report and will make that decision.
[01:33:48.557 --> 01:33:49.497]  Let's put it this way.
[01:33:49.497 --> 01:33:55.760]  If you don't have a legal foundation to surveil somebody and you keep doing it, is that bad?
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.161]  Absolutely.
[01:33:57.161 --> 01:34:00.043]  Is that spying?
[01:34:00.043 --> 01:34:02.124]  It's illegal surveillance.
[01:34:02.124 --> 01:34:03.524]  It's not court authorized surveillance.
[01:34:03.524 --> 01:34:06.446]  Whatever illegal surveillance means, they did it.
[01:34:08.484 --> 01:34:13.026]  So, all this stuff that they did and they legally surveilled Trump's campaign.
[01:34:13.026 --> 01:34:25.412]  They did because they had no legal basis after the January 2017 data dump by the Russian guy to believe that the dossier was reliable.
[01:34:25.412 --> 01:34:36.637]  They altered a sculptory information in June of 2017 that would have further proven that Carter Page is not a Russian agent, he was actually working with the CIA.
[01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:37.418]  Let me ask you a very
[01:34:38.078 --> 01:34:38.899]  Directly.
[01:34:38.899 --> 01:34:46.566]  Do you believe Carter Page is or ever was an agent of the Russian government trying to do harm to his country?
[01:34:46.566 --> 01:34:56.676]  I'm going to refer to the evidence we found here, which is that at the end of this, they, the FBI, at the end of these fizes told us that they had found...
[01:34:57.757 --> 01:35:01.103]  And then I don't know why on the Twitter clip they cut off where he says, no, I have the transcript.
[01:35:01.103 --> 01:35:03.107]  He said no evidence of any of that.
[01:35:03.107 --> 01:35:05.391]  Well, again, getting the good clip for everybody right now.
[01:35:05.391 --> 01:35:05.912]  It's on YouTube.
[01:35:05.912 --> 01:35:08.036]  I can send it to the crew if they'd like.
[01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:09.919]  Going to Lee Stranahan, who lives in D.C.
[01:35:11.511 --> 01:35:21.560]  As the syndicated show Fault Lines Radio, he's in England, the UK, for this big election that's a referendum on nationalism versus globalism.
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:25.604]  And there's giant million-person marches in France happening right now.
[01:35:25.604 --> 01:35:29.808]  Huge marches in Germany against the open borders and carbon taxes.
[01:35:29.808 --> 01:35:33.311]  Europe is really on fire right now, and Lee Stranahan's right in the middle of it.
[01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:35.794]  But I know he wanted to have some comments on the IG report.
[01:35:36.434 --> 01:35:38.656]  And his sources in D.C.
[01:35:38.656 --> 01:35:47.382]  and what he thinks is coming from Durham, if it's going to be more of the same whitewash or if there's a real fight going on internally, as the Attorney General Barr has said there is.
[01:35:49.417 --> 01:36:00.369]  Well, Alex, look, I think I was so happy to see Durham come out right after the Horowitz report came out within a couple of hours and say, we do not agree with the conclusions.
[01:36:00.369 --> 01:36:05.414]  And look, I'm even glad to see Lindsey Graham show some spine there.
[01:36:05.414 --> 01:36:10.499]  He's somebody I'm not a huge Lindsey Graham fan, but I'm glad to see him show some spine.
[01:36:10.499 --> 01:36:11.981]  Now, here's what I'm reporting.
[01:36:12.441 --> 01:36:13.682]  And this is very important.
[01:36:13.682 --> 01:36:15.543]  It's on my Twitter feed.
[01:36:15.543 --> 01:36:17.444]  And Alex, you know the way I work.
[01:36:17.444 --> 01:36:18.985]  Everything is proven.
[01:36:18.985 --> 01:36:22.467]  There's nothing here that's not admitted by the people involved.
[01:36:22.467 --> 01:36:26.969]  There was a very significant omission in Horowitz's report.
[01:36:26.969 --> 01:36:31.371]  That's on page 116 in the report.
[01:36:31.371 --> 01:36:37.675]  They make reference to the fact that Steele gave them material, gave the FBI material,
[01:36:38.436 --> 01:36:46.419]  That they got from, and this is a quote from Horowitz, from a friend of a well-known Hillary Clinton supporter.
[01:36:46.419 --> 01:36:58.524]  Now, the friend and the well-known Hillary Clinton supporter, that is a mischaracterization and these two people are not named by name and who's who they are.
[01:36:58.524 --> 01:37:02.866]  The well-known Clinton supporter is Sid Blumenthal.
[01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:08.083]  The friend of the Clinton supporter is Cody Shearer.
[01:37:08.083 --> 01:37:10.024]  I'll talk about him in a second.
[01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:12.846]  That is a complete mischaracterization.
[01:37:12.846 --> 01:37:17.869]  So for one thing, Sid Blumenthal, everyone knows who Sid Blumenthal is, right?
[01:37:17.869 --> 01:37:19.890]  He's not a Clinton supporter.
[01:37:19.890 --> 01:37:23.932]  He's not somebody who had a bumper sticker that said, I'm with her on the back of his car.
[01:37:23.932 --> 01:37:25.513]  That's a supporter, right?
[01:37:25.513 --> 01:37:32.638]  He worked for the Clintons, and he's worked with the Clintons since 1992 when he was one of the Dirty Tricks guys.
[01:37:33.323 --> 01:37:38.685]  Now, Cody Shearer, and what we're talking about here is what's called the second dossier.
[01:37:38.685 --> 01:37:41.647]  But as I'll explain, it's really the first dossier.
[01:37:41.647 --> 01:37:44.908]  This is, Alex, this is exactly the center of it.
[01:37:44.908 --> 01:37:53.511]  And the reason this is so important is this is what ties Hillary and Bill Clinton right into the Russiagate hoax.
[01:37:53.511 --> 01:37:56.873]  And that's why Horowitz leaving their names out is so significant.
[01:37:57.393 --> 01:38:08.435]  What happened was, Cody Shearer, who's known Bill Clinton since 1969, since before he knew Hillary, Cody Shearer goes back as far as you can go with Bill Clinton.
[01:38:09.622 --> 01:38:14.546]  Back to Oxford, where Strobe Talbot married Cody Shearer's twin sister, Brooke.
[01:38:14.546 --> 01:38:15.286]  Okay?
[01:38:15.286 --> 01:38:21.871]  Now, Cody Shearer has done this dirty trick stuff for Bill Clinton going back to 1992.
[01:38:21.871 --> 01:38:30.698]  He was the one who was going out and scaring Kathleen Willey, and he was the one going out dealing with Jennifer Flowers and stuff like that, working with Sid Blumenthal.
[01:38:31.198 --> 01:38:39.763]  Yes, he's a well-known Clinton henchman from their first campaign, and so of course they're connected into the whole nest.
[01:38:39.763 --> 01:38:42.304]  They're involved going around getting the fake warrants.
[01:38:42.304 --> 01:38:44.665]  So go ahead and nail them for us.
[01:38:44.665 --> 01:38:45.546]  Well, here's what it is.
[01:38:48.311 --> 01:38:50.652]  When was Christopher Steele hired?
[01:38:50.652 --> 01:38:52.373]  June 2016.
[01:38:52.373 --> 01:38:54.795]  The Horowitz Report says that.
[01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:58.777]  When was Cody Shearer talking to people about his dossier?
[01:38:58.777 --> 01:39:00.958]  The answer is March or April.
[01:39:00.958 --> 01:39:07.402]  That's in an article by Lee Smith that you can find where he talks about Cody Shearer talking to an ex-CIA guy named Bayer.
[01:39:08.214 --> 01:39:08.794]  What happened?
[01:39:08.794 --> 01:39:10.715]  So, in other words, this is the first dossier.
[01:39:10.715 --> 01:39:13.155]  Now, let me explain how Sid Blumenthal works.
[01:39:13.155 --> 01:39:18.257]  You know this, Alex, but I want people to understand his fingerprints are all over this.
[01:39:18.257 --> 01:39:20.717]  So, I've interviewed on my show a guy named Larry Johnson.
[01:39:20.717 --> 01:39:26.859]  Larry Johnson's an ex-CIA analyst who's done some great work over at the website 6 Tempered Tyrannus.
[01:39:27.651 --> 01:39:31.514]  Larry Johnson actually worked with Sid Blumenthal.
[01:39:31.514 --> 01:39:37.097]  He regrets it now, but he tried to help Hillary when she was going against Obama.
[01:39:37.097 --> 01:39:40.940]  And so, Larry's told me this and he's named a couple stories.
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.841]  Here's what Sid Blumenthal does.
[01:39:42.841 --> 01:39:49.766]  He went to Larry and he said, hey, look, I understand there's a speech where Michelle Obama used the word whitey.
[01:39:50.583 --> 01:39:54.125]  So go look into that and talk to this source.
[01:39:54.125 --> 01:39:56.046]  So Larry looked into it.
[01:39:56.046 --> 01:40:03.010]  There were three different sources that had found that, except here's what he found.
[01:40:03.010 --> 01:40:10.874]  When he looked into it further, he found that all three sources got that information from Sid Blumenthal.
[01:40:10.874 --> 01:40:14.976]  So what Sid does is he plants a story here, here, and here.
[01:40:15.706 --> 01:40:17.928]  Just like they did with the dossier.
[01:40:17.928 --> 01:40:26.456]  The Shearer dossier had the same now debunked sex story about Trump that the Steele dossier had, and don't forget it came first.
[01:40:26.456 --> 01:40:39.568]  Yes, and so it's in the Horowitz report that Hillary Clinton created the fake trail for the illegal surveillance, and of course it leads right back to her, which we always knew, but it is very interesting.
[01:40:39.568 --> 01:40:41.570]  I want to get into the election and what's happening in... Yeah.
[01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:46.972]  Well, I think, first off, Durham's not going to go probably as far as you or I would like, but that's okay.
[01:41:11.431 --> 01:41:13.031]  Because we have pretty high standards.
[01:41:13.031 --> 01:41:15.192]  But I think there's going to be indictments.
[01:41:15.192 --> 01:41:19.193]  They're already saying, don't forget, that this is a criminal investigation.
[01:41:19.193 --> 01:41:24.635]  And I think you could even see in that clip you played earlier that Horowitz is now taking a position.
[01:41:24.635 --> 01:41:30.117]  I wish, like I say, I have no idea why he left the name Sid Blumenthal and Cody Shearer out of the report.
[01:41:30.117 --> 01:41:35.918]  But you can see that he's tentative, let's call it that.
[01:41:35.918 --> 01:41:38.139]  But he's saying, well, I'm going to let the courts decide.
[01:41:38.892 --> 01:41:46.922]  If you were to cut out the conclusion part of the Horowitz Report and just read the report and come up with your own conclusions?
[01:41:46.922 --> 01:41:47.683]  It's very damning.
[01:41:47.683 --> 01:41:50.226]  This is very damning, right.
[01:41:50.226 --> 01:41:53.551]  And then just right at the end they go, well, there's nothing
[01:41:54.754 --> 01:41:55.675]  No bias.
[01:41:55.675 --> 01:42:03.300]  Well, if there's no bias, how do you account for the fact that there were 17 significant errors and every one went against Trump?
[01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:08.003]  In other words, it's not like there were 5 errors that helped him and 12 against him.
[01:42:08.003 --> 01:42:09.504]  17 errors are all against Trump.
[01:42:09.504 --> 01:42:10.605]  Now, I don't have another explanation.
[01:42:10.605 --> 01:42:12.266]  Well, they're not errors when you falsify emails.
[01:42:15.449 --> 01:42:19.352]  But again, they can't let the investigation go any higher because these people were ordered to do this.
[01:42:19.352 --> 01:42:21.033]  And we all know who it leads back to.
[01:42:21.033 --> 01:42:23.855]  And then what about Carter Page being the CIA operative?
[01:42:23.855 --> 01:42:25.597]  I said that back at the beginning.
[01:42:25.597 --> 01:42:28.158]  I don't know if he was set up or whether he was working with them.
[01:42:28.158 --> 01:42:29.199]  I'll get your brief take on that.
[01:42:29.199 --> 01:42:34.123]  But then I want to just get into the big election in the UK and why you're there and why this is such a big deal.
[01:42:34.123 --> 01:42:38.567]  And then Lee Stranahan of Faultline Radio will leave us and we're going to go right to your phone calls.
[01:42:39.207 --> 01:42:52.797]  For everybody that's holding, like Brian, and Kevin, and Peter, and so many others, we'll just take calls right through to the end of the show, with breaking news as it comes out, release train at hand leaves us, Mike Adams is in the fourth hour, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, stay with us.

[01:44:57.369 --> 01:45:00.612]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[01:45:00.612 --> 01:45:18.009]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[01:45:18.009 --> 01:45:19.350]  We're being taken off the land.
[01:45:20.191 --> 01:45:30.840]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:39.988]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:44.090]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:48.572]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[01:45:48.572 --> 01:45:50.433]  This is the post-human error.
[01:45:50.433 --> 01:45:53.194]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[01:45:53.194 --> 01:45:54.655]  This is the crossroads.
[01:45:54.655 --> 01:45:56.476]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.

[01:47:20.646 --> 01:47:29.111]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[01:47:29.111 --> 01:47:33.474]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:33.474 --> 01:47:37.657]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[01:47:37.657 --> 01:47:39.258]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:41.337 --> 01:47:42.678]  It is Wednesday, December 11, 2019.
[01:47:42.678 --> 01:47:45.480]  Your phone call is just minutes away.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:46.781]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[01:47:46.781 --> 01:47:50.684]  Lee Stranahan is in London, England for the big elections that start tomorrow.
[01:47:50.684 --> 01:47:58.589]  Boris Johnson facing the left is trying to remove him from office, but internal polls and public polls show them winning by a wide margin.
[01:47:58.589 --> 01:48:02.312]  But there's massive election fraud there, just like here, that's been documented.
[01:48:02.312 --> 01:48:04.534]  They're trying to leave the EU that they never even voted.
[01:48:05.495 --> 01:48:06.056]  To enter.
[01:48:06.056 --> 01:48:06.997]  How is that?
[01:48:06.997 --> 01:48:14.064]  Well, just like Trump pulled us out of the TPP that we never voted to enter, now he's making it go through Congress as he should.
[01:48:14.064 --> 01:48:16.526]  I oppose, by the way, many parts of it.
[01:48:16.526 --> 01:48:19.769]  But at least it's being put through Congress.
[01:48:19.769 --> 01:48:21.451]  And Lee Stranahan is there to cover this.
[01:48:21.451 --> 01:48:23.013]  I wanted to just finish, though, Lee.
[01:48:24.537 --> 01:48:25.378]  With Carter Page.
[01:48:25.378 --> 01:48:27.059]  I'm not saying Carter Page is a bad guy.
[01:48:27.059 --> 01:48:28.019]  I'm not saying he's a good guy.
[01:48:28.019 --> 01:48:28.580]  I don't know.
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:38.687]  I just said it's pretty clear a lot of these guys are globalist operatives and these people they claim are CIA or FSB or being funded by FSB.
[01:48:38.687 --> 01:48:40.028]  It turns out are CIA.
[01:48:40.788 --> 01:48:43.489]  And of course, that's come out with a bunch of these other people.
[01:48:43.489 --> 01:48:45.849]  And I don't think they're just burning their own CIA people.
[01:48:45.849 --> 01:48:50.410]  I think they're just having them play along with it in the media to try to give it some credibility.
[01:48:50.410 --> 01:48:58.252]  And then, Page does have a lawsuit, and then the media tries to say, oh, you really are still a Russian agent when there's no proof of that, and that's defamation.
[01:48:58.252 --> 01:49:00.313]  What do you really think's going on with Carter Page?
[01:49:00.313 --> 01:49:01.233]  I just find it really interesting.
[01:49:02.267 --> 01:49:04.709]  Well, let me give you some inside info, Alex.
[01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:10.413]  Andrei Telezenko, I've been on the show a number of times for the past couple of years.
[01:49:10.413 --> 01:49:16.177]  We were ahead of this, and again, God bless you for letting me get the truth out about the Ukraine intervention.
[01:49:16.177 --> 01:49:17.558]  We've talked about it many times.
[01:49:18.118 --> 01:49:28.402]  Now, Andrei Telezenko is the real whistleblower who was working at the Ukrainian embassy when he was approached by Alexander Chalupa and said, hey, you need to work with me.
[01:49:28.402 --> 01:49:29.863]  I'm in the Hillary campaign.
[01:49:29.863 --> 01:49:34.144]  And he chose not to do it, in part because he's a Christian, by the way.
[01:49:34.144 --> 01:49:40.867]  Andrei told me that when he was working at the embassy, this would have been back in March and April, around that time,
[01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:58.958]  Before any of the Russian hacking stuff, before that Washington Post story came out, before anybody had heard of Carter Page, they at the Ukrainian embassy, and I want you to think about this Alex, knew who Carter Page and George Papadopoulos were, when nobody had ever heard of them.
[01:49:58.958 --> 01:50:05.801]  So why is it that the Ukraine, and the answer is obvious, that this was part of the network that was being set up
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:07.780]  To frame Trump.
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:09.881]  That was part of what was going on.
[01:50:09.881 --> 01:50:13.682]  And so they knew about that and they commented on it immediately.
[01:50:13.682 --> 01:50:18.084]  They're like, yep, Papadopoulos and Carter Page, we got to get those guys.
[01:50:18.084 --> 01:50:24.786]  Now, by the way, Andre was at an appearance about a year ago on another network.
[01:50:25.346 --> 01:50:28.787]  And George Papadopoulos was in the green room and he told him that story.
[01:50:28.787 --> 01:50:31.248]  And I got word to Carter Page as well.
[01:50:31.248 --> 01:50:36.449]  I'm like, look, you were being singled out, right?
[01:50:36.449 --> 01:50:43.631]  Singled out by the Ukrainians that were working with the Hillary campaign before you had any idea who they were.
[01:50:43.931 --> 01:50:48.834]  And so Page is a good guy, and so is Papadopoulos, but the point is that he was a CIA asset.
[01:50:48.834 --> 01:50:50.935]  They were even then going to set up their own.
[01:50:50.935 --> 01:50:51.556]  That is unbelievable.
[01:50:51.556 --> 01:50:58.540]  Now in the time we have left, let's shift gears into, we can get negative about the globalists and negative about the corruption, but it's all out in the open now.
[01:50:58.540 --> 01:51:02.442]  That is a really positive thing, and all over Europe it would take hours to go over it.
[01:51:02.442 --> 01:51:06.265]  Giant populist takeovers, millions marching today as we speak.
[01:51:06.265 --> 01:51:09.807]  This huge election, this referendum on nationalism versus
[01:51:10.905 --> 01:51:12.686]  Authoritarian Globalism, you're there.
[01:51:12.686 --> 01:51:13.807]  Why are you in England?
[01:51:13.807 --> 01:51:15.388]  Give us your breakdown.
[01:51:15.388 --> 01:51:18.270]  Well, this is a big event and I'll tell you what's happened, though.
[01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:19.251]  It's interesting.
[01:51:19.251 --> 01:51:24.155]  The polls have narrowed significantly just in the past two weeks.
[01:51:24.155 --> 01:51:30.139]  At one point, the Tories, the Conservatives, led by Boris Johnson, had a 17-point lead.
[01:51:30.139 --> 01:51:31.940]  That is now down to single digits.
[01:51:33.181 --> 01:51:36.603]  It is rapidly closing, and here's why I think that is.
[01:51:36.603 --> 01:51:40.665]  It's not that people's thirst for real freedom has gone down.
[01:51:40.665 --> 01:51:48.169]  It's that the Brexit that Boris Johnson's presenting them, number one, is a very watered-down version of Brexit.
[01:51:48.169 --> 01:51:55.893]  So it's taken three years to get through, and now it's basically the same thing that Theresa May was offering when they gave her the boot.
[01:51:55.893 --> 01:51:57.654]  Here's the other problem.
[01:51:57.654 --> 01:52:00.576]  The other problem is that Boris Johnson is not
[01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:06.073]  First off, Boris Johnson has never met a regime change war he didn't like, right?
[01:52:06.073 --> 01:52:10.918]  So, with Boris Johnson and the Conservatives, you're getting a real mixed bag here.
[01:52:10.918 --> 01:52:15.102]  Which is, he's promoting himself as, I'm the Brexit guy.
[01:52:15.102 --> 01:52:17.984]  Not really, that was Nigel Farage, but okay.
[01:52:17.984 --> 01:52:18.825]  But, Farage.
[01:52:19.904 --> 01:52:22.264]  Okay, he's promoting himself as the Brexit guy.
[01:52:22.264 --> 01:52:26.505]  The Brexit he's offering people is very watered down.
[01:52:26.505 --> 01:52:36.647]  And there have been a few scandals that have come out that have hurt Johnson that basically it's about the British equivalent of Social Security, the National Health Service.
[01:52:36.647 --> 01:52:38.488]  It's their socialized medicine.
[01:52:38.488 --> 01:52:45.289]  But for them, it's the equivalent of, you know, in America right now, if you tried to take away Social Security, people would go mental.
[01:52:46.019 --> 01:52:52.443]  And so there were scandals that had come out that they were going to sell the British system out to the corporatists.
[01:52:52.443 --> 01:52:55.084]  So it wasn't like they were going to open it up and make it free and good.
[01:52:55.084 --> 01:52:57.786]  They were going to sell it to the American corporatists.
[01:52:57.786 --> 01:53:00.047]  And that has really hurt the conservatives.
[01:53:00.047 --> 01:53:08.192]  Now, I think what you're going to see, the same thing that we saw in Germany, Italy, Israel, you've seen this all over the world.
[01:53:08.192 --> 01:53:11.434]  People can't get a government form, basically.
[01:53:11.434 --> 01:53:14.436]  I think what you're going to get is a narrow conservative victory.
[01:53:15.129 --> 01:53:17.851]  And again, that's a conservative party over here.
[01:53:17.851 --> 01:53:22.955]  And they're not really, and don't forget, not all conservatives are pro-Brexit either.
[01:53:22.955 --> 01:53:24.396]  A lot of them are Remain.
[01:53:24.396 --> 01:53:28.539]  The people who've tanked completely are the Liberal Democrats.
[01:53:28.539 --> 01:53:31.662]  The Liberal Democrats over here are staunchly Remain.
[01:53:32.362 --> 01:53:35.445]  And they used to be the dominant political party in England.
[01:53:35.445 --> 01:53:37.086]  They would win every election.
[01:53:37.086 --> 01:53:42.870]  Now, they're gonna take a big hit, and I think Labor's gonna take somewhat of a hit, and partially.
[01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:48.915]  The reason why is that Corbyn, the leader of the Labor Party over here, Corbyn
[01:53:50.029 --> 01:53:51.090]  That's a bad choice, right?
[01:54:10.587 --> 01:54:16.592]  I like Sanders better than Hillary Clinton because she's dangerous in every single way.
[01:54:16.592 --> 01:54:18.654]  Exactly.
[01:54:18.654 --> 01:54:23.958]  That's a really good point and Boris Johnson has played it off like he's this populist.
[01:54:27.170 --> 01:54:31.375]  Clearly it is a watered-down version, but it does show that people are aware of globalism.
[01:54:31.375 --> 01:54:32.396]  They're trying to break away.
[01:54:32.396 --> 01:54:43.808]  I personally don't like the Labor Party because of their open borders Islamist stance, and I think that Boris Johnson is going to win, but we'll certainly have you pop in while you follow this.
[01:54:43.808 --> 01:54:45.490]  When will all the results be in?
[01:54:45.490 --> 01:54:47.132]  I know these elections take a few days over there.
[01:54:48.311 --> 01:54:55.254]  They, well I think we'll know Friday, I think on Friday we'll have a very very good idea with exit polling and everything else.
[01:54:55.254 --> 01:54:59.196]  So the elections on Thursday, I'll tell you one thing that's interesting Alex, being here in London,
[01:55:00.752 --> 01:55:05.334]  Walking around the streets, you would have no idea there's an election tomorrow.
[01:55:05.334 --> 01:55:07.815]  You'd know Christmas is coming up.
[01:55:07.815 --> 01:55:11.776]  London, at Christmas, I've never been here before, but it's very Christmassy.
[01:55:11.776 --> 01:55:15.177]  But I'm telling you, people are so fatigued.
[01:55:15.177 --> 01:55:20.499]  Brexit for the people in Great Britain is like our Russiagate.
[01:55:20.499 --> 01:55:22.180]  Most people are just sick of it.
[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:25.701]  They don't... No, I understand, and that's what the globalists want, is to drag it out.
[01:55:25.701 --> 01:55:27.201]  But in the end, globalism is dead.
[01:55:27.201 --> 01:55:28.542]  Lee Stranahan, thank you so much.
[01:55:29.721 --> 01:55:30.422]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:55:55.083 --> 01:55:57.165]  At least 20 calls next hour.

[01:55:57.906 --> 01:55:58.026]  877-789-2539.
[01:55:58.026 --> 01:55:58.627]  And check this out.
[01:56:03.643 --> 01:56:09.828]  Dear TV viewer, we have the best, purest, cleanest, highest-end krill oil you're going to find anywhere, and it's 50% off.
[01:56:09.828 --> 01:56:13.452]  This has sold out for three months, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:56:13.452 --> 01:56:19.817]  And just that beautiful red color, because it hasn't been denatured, it hasn't been pasteurized to lose the quality.
[01:56:19.817 --> 01:56:23.340]  And the focus, what it does to the brain, but also it's a calm focus.
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:26.983]  Talk about energy, nothing gives me energy like high-quality fish oil or krill oil.
[01:56:26.983 --> 01:56:28.244]  And krill oil is the
[01:56:29.085 --> 01:56:34.467]  Highest concentration of these key components of essential fatty acids that you're going to find out there.
[01:56:34.467 --> 01:56:39.008]  We're really proud of this krill oil and I take it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[01:56:39.008 --> 01:56:41.349]  I take three capsules a day.
[01:56:41.349 --> 01:56:42.849]  That's not all the capsules come in a bottle.
[01:56:42.849 --> 01:56:46.150]  I've been eating out of this one a few days, but they're really beautiful.
[01:56:46.670 --> 01:56:52.652]  And they're amazing, and especially for your children, for people that are, you know, in school, who want to have that clarity, that focus.
[01:56:52.652 --> 01:56:56.653]  This is really a performance enhancement thing for the mind, right from God.
[01:56:56.653 --> 01:56:59.173]  And a lot of little krill died to bring you this.

[01:57:28.860 --> 01:57:30.001]  That's how we fund the operation.
[01:57:30.001 --> 01:57:34.367]  It is beyond essential to the future of all of our freedoms, not just this Republic.
[01:57:34.367 --> 01:57:40.955]  So, we'll be right back on the other side with your phone calls in T-minus two minutes.
[01:57:40.955 --> 01:57:41.936]  Thank you all for joining us.
[01:57:46.315 --> 01:57:47.135]  Andy in Florida.
[01:57:47.135 --> 01:57:47.736]  Thank you, Andy.
[01:57:47.736 --> 01:57:48.136]  Go ahead.
[01:57:48.136 --> 01:57:49.436]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:49.436 --> 01:57:50.217]  I love you, man.
[01:57:50.217 --> 01:57:50.837]  We love you.
[01:57:50.837 --> 01:57:54.799]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic at hand, I gotta talk about one of your products.
[01:57:54.799 --> 01:57:55.519]  A little bit about me.
[01:57:55.519 --> 01:57:56.980]  I'm 245 pounds.
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:57:59.981]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[01:57:59.981 --> 01:58:03.283]  And to make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[01:58:03.283 --> 01:58:07.765]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[01:58:08.285 --> 01:58:08.625]  I think so.
[01:58:23.650 --> 01:58:26.051]  We're really proud of TurboForce, so thank you, sir.
[01:58:26.051 --> 01:58:29.191]  Commit to buy a lot of your products at InfoWarsTore.com, then help us spread the word.
[01:58:29.191 --> 01:58:29.931]  Let's just get busy.
[01:58:29.931 --> 01:58:30.352]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:48.261 --> 01:58:50.223]  Twilight is here.
[01:58:50.223 --> 01:58:56.247]  The sun is setting on 2019 and we hurdle into the year 2020.
[01:58:56.247 --> 01:59:02.091]  Only 330 days out from this incredibly historic election.
[01:59:02.091 --> 01:59:06.274]  And it's more important than ever to pray for President Trump and to pray for his provision and his protection.
[01:59:06.274 --> 01:59:07.956]  He's completely surrounded.
[01:59:07.956 --> 01:59:09.497]  And to pray for him to have discernment.
[01:59:10.715 --> 01:59:20.623]  And to be bold and to take action and not listen to the advisors that tell him to hold back and that if he goes after the deep state that they'll remove him from office.
[01:59:20.623 --> 01:59:26.427]  They're trying to remove him regardless because they know that God put him in office.
[01:59:27.248 --> 01:59:32.673]  And that he's going to continue his work and he's going to continue exposing them and bringing them down.
[01:59:32.673 --> 01:59:37.637]  But that if he doesn't execute in that office that God's given him, that the globalists could win.
[01:59:37.637 --> 01:59:42.481]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time more than ever to pray for President Trump and please pray for him for worse.
[01:59:42.481 --> 01:59:45.263]  And please pray for all the children being targeted by the globalists.
[01:59:45.263 --> 01:59:49.867]  Thank you and God bless you all.
[01:59:49.867 --> 01:59:52.549]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:11.443 --> 02:00:17.719]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.845 --> 02:00:31.628]  All right, I'm dedicated to taking your calls because I love the directions and the wild cards you take us in.
[02:00:31.628 --> 02:00:33.569]  And I'm going to your calls right now.
[02:00:33.569 --> 02:00:48.775]  I gotta tell you, I'm really proud of Kaitlin Bennett, Millie Weaver, Will Johnson, Owen Troyer, and more of our crew that is on the East Coast at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings right now ahead of the impeachment trial.
[02:00:48.775 --> 02:00:52.017]  Millie Weaver is live tweeting from inside.
[02:00:52.017 --> 02:00:54.338]  Incredible developments where
[02:00:55.498 --> 02:01:01.400]  I guess Lindsey Graham's found his cojones and is saying that it's like J. Edgar Hoover's back from the dead.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:06.141]  The level of persecution of Trump and others and the press by the rogue FBI.
[02:01:06.141 --> 02:01:08.562]  The president can't even get control of these people.
[02:01:08.562 --> 02:01:12.283]  Schiff's got more power than the president because their operatives are all in there.
[02:01:12.283 --> 02:01:14.984]  But they're just exposing themselves.
[02:01:14.984 --> 02:01:15.905]  This happened in the 70s.
[02:01:15.905 --> 02:01:18.145]  The deep state took out Nixon.
[02:01:18.145 --> 02:01:21.186]  It then unraveled and took a bunch of them out for a while.
[02:01:21.186 --> 02:01:22.707]  Then their underlings came in with Bush.
[02:01:24.633 --> 02:01:26.434]  This time it's not going to be that way.
[02:01:26.434 --> 02:01:27.394]  This is a big deal.
[02:01:27.394 --> 02:01:29.035]  Positive things are happening.
[02:01:29.035 --> 02:01:31.896]  And then Owen and the crew out in Hershey, Pennsylvania last night.
[02:01:31.896 --> 02:01:36.598]  That incredible footage of the armored vehicle coming up in their designated area.
[02:01:36.598 --> 02:01:39.259]  Loudspeakering the Antifa.
[02:01:39.259 --> 02:01:40.800]  Just incredible footage.
[02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:46.583]  At InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, but especially on Millie's Twitter and Owen's.
[02:01:46.583 --> 02:01:52.826]  It's just incredible how you're keeping us in the game and how our crew is rising to the occasion.
[02:01:52.826 --> 02:01:56.628]  I'm really proud of what we've done, and I should be more happy and more positive.
[02:01:56.628 --> 02:01:57.888]  I just get so pissed at the Globalists.
[02:01:57.888 --> 02:01:59.989]  We all have to be very thankful to God.
[02:01:59.989 --> 02:02:05.012]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Peter in Michigan.
[02:02:05.012 --> 02:02:05.992]  Peter, thanks for holding.
[02:02:05.992 --> 02:02:06.493]  You're a trooper.
[02:02:06.493 --> 02:02:06.793]  Go ahead.
[02:02:08.513 --> 02:02:20.221]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to hear your opinion on what do you think the probability is of any meaningful arrest of like deep state actors happening while Trump is president?
[02:02:20.221 --> 02:02:23.643]  Because I took Locker up as a campaign promise.
[02:02:23.643 --> 02:02:28.546]  It's pretty disappointing to see them attack him so unlawfully and nothing really happened.
[02:02:30.333 --> 02:02:40.772]  Well that's really the big question and I accurately predicted that the IG report would say no conscious criminal activity and that the investigation was opened.
[02:02:43.086 --> 02:02:44.367]  Properly.
[02:02:44.367 --> 02:02:46.689]  But then you read it and he admits they were illegally spying.
[02:02:46.689 --> 02:02:49.831]  So even if you know something is illegal, it's illegal.
[02:02:49.831 --> 02:02:52.693]  Or if you don't know it's illegal, it's illegal.
[02:02:52.693 --> 02:02:54.254]  Knowing makes it more of a crime.
[02:02:54.254 --> 02:02:55.795]  But crimes have been committed.
[02:02:55.795 --> 02:02:57.977]  They must be prosecuted.
[02:02:57.977 --> 02:03:03.521]  And I don't think Barr is just stalling now what I've been watching, what I've been seeing.
[02:03:04.461 --> 02:03:07.502]  I think he's trying to get indictments to move forward.
[02:03:07.502 --> 02:03:24.547]  I think they know they have to, because the globalist, CHICOM-funded Deep State is so un-American, so virulent, so doddering, so dangerous, that even other sections of the power structure that aren't really even, you know, pro-America, they just see, why wreck the country for no reason?
[02:03:24.547 --> 02:03:31.269]  Why let a bunch of crazy people run in the ground and cause a civil war, just because they have existential envy for the Republic?
[02:03:31.269 --> 02:03:31.549]  And so,
[02:03:32.509 --> 02:03:34.571]  We've already seen incredible fireworks with Trump.
[02:03:34.571 --> 02:03:44.121]  It's not moving as fast as we want, but if I had to be a betting man, I think there's going to be some indictments, low-level folks, and then they're going to start turning state's evidence.
[02:03:44.121 --> 02:03:51.088]  And I think that if Trump can stop election fraud and get in in 2020, I think by then you will see them move against the deep state.
[02:03:51.088 --> 02:03:52.149]  That's why they're so scared.
[02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:53.871]  He's already been trying to move against them.
[02:03:53.871 --> 02:03:55.713]  He's already been trying to get us out of these endless wars.
[02:03:56.053 --> 02:03:58.614]  The truth is coming out about Afghanistan being a fraud.
[02:03:58.614 --> 02:04:00.975]  And so that's why it's such a battle right now.
[02:04:00.975 --> 02:04:05.676]  Trump just doesn't have enough good men and women under him to execute his orders.
[02:04:05.676 --> 02:04:06.356]  So it's a battle.
[02:04:06.356 --> 02:04:06.796]  I don't know.
[02:04:06.796 --> 02:04:08.317]  I think it's 50-50.
[02:04:08.317 --> 02:04:09.797]  I think it's up to us, too.
[02:04:09.797 --> 02:04:18.180]  I guarantee you, if every event Democrats went to, people jumped up and yelled at them with information, and if Congress got legally and lawfully took over by protesters during all this,
[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:33.110]  I guarantee you we'd end up winning, but they need to see the energy from the people, and that will translate into the so-called leaders, because most of these people aren't leaders, they're puppets of the globalists, and we're put there because they go with which way the wind blows.
[02:04:33.110 --> 02:04:39.094]  Well then, I'm here to give them the wind, like the great north wind, and let them know!
[02:04:41.138 --> 02:04:43.202]  Set our people free!
[02:04:43.202 --> 02:04:45.906]  Let us go out of Egypt!

[02:05:57.177 --> 02:05:59.259]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:59.259 --> 02:06:01.961]  Because there is a war on, for your mind.
[02:06:04.292 --> 02:06:13.018]  Well, Lindsey Graham, since his handler, John McCain, made the jump into hyperspace, has been growing a bigger and bigger set of eggs.
[02:06:13.018 --> 02:06:15.500]  Here he is.
[02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:27.368]  To your team, you were able to uncover and discover abuse of power I never believed would actually exist in 2019.
[02:06:27.368 --> 02:06:29.310]  How bad is it?
[02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:29.890]  It was as if.
[02:06:32.526 --> 02:06:35.108]  J Edgar Hoover came back to life.
[02:06:35.108 --> 02:06:37.250]  The old FBI.
[02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:47.138]  The FBI that had a chip on its shoulder and wanted to intimidate people and find out what was going on in your life and the law be damned.
[02:06:47.138 --> 02:06:52.563]  Martin Luther King and just fill in the names.
[02:06:52.563 --> 02:06:58.087]  Uh, the J Edgar Hoover FBI was a lot better than the one we got now, but I get what he's saying.
[02:06:58.087 --> 02:07:01.310]  I mean, um, it's on record that
[02:07:03.154 --> 02:07:10.560]  Ted Gunderson ran the COINTELPRO against Martin Luther King and made up a lot of the fake stuff.
[02:07:10.560 --> 02:07:12.101]  Some of it was true.
[02:07:12.101 --> 02:07:13.802]  Sent letters to his wife, harassed him.
[02:07:13.802 --> 02:07:16.864]  He apologized for that before it even ever got declassified.
[02:07:22.645 --> 02:07:28.627]  The current FBI at the top is run by a bunch of anti-American globalist leftists, but I get his point.
[02:07:28.627 --> 02:07:34.608]  The corruption, the intimidation that we know the FBI has been caught doing decades ago is going on again.
[02:07:34.608 --> 02:07:39.189]  And it's going on against the President and his supporters?
[02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:40.790]  And it's illegal?
[02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:41.910]  And it's out of control?
[02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:44.751]  And they falsified records?
[02:07:44.751 --> 02:07:49.632]  The only shot the FBI has of not being totally discredited
[02:07:52.438 --> 02:07:56.321]  is prosecutions of the people that did this.
[02:07:56.321 --> 02:07:58.802]  And I get it, it goes all the way up to Obama and Clapper.
[02:07:58.802 --> 02:08:02.285]  Good!
[02:08:02.285 --> 02:08:04.266]  We at least need criminal investigations opened.
[02:08:04.266 --> 02:08:07.068]  We need their asses indicted.
[02:08:07.068 --> 02:08:08.269]  They're trying to indict the president.
[02:08:08.269 --> 02:08:10.911]  They're trying to remove our president who hasn't done jack squat.
[02:08:10.911 --> 02:08:13.132]  They're attacking us and we haven't done anything!
[02:08:13.132 --> 02:08:14.313]  They've done everything!
[02:08:16.189 --> 02:08:18.290]  Let me tell you, I don't want to go the way of a banana republic.
[02:08:18.290 --> 02:08:19.010]  We're very close.
[02:08:19.010 --> 02:08:22.131]  I don't want to discredit institutions in this country.
[02:08:22.131 --> 02:08:23.271]  There are institutions.
[02:08:23.271 --> 02:08:25.172]  We need to take control of them.
[02:08:25.172 --> 02:08:26.772]  We need to fix the government.
[02:08:26.772 --> 02:08:27.772]  It's never going to be perfect.
[02:08:27.772 --> 02:08:28.853]  We're all just people.
[02:08:28.853 --> 02:08:31.274]  But this one's out of control and rogue.
[02:08:31.274 --> 02:08:35.675]  You look at the arrogance of Strzok and Page and McCabe on TV.
[02:08:40.123 --> 02:08:43.045]  And you look at Comey saying, see, Trump lied.
[02:08:43.045 --> 02:08:44.346]  We never spied on him.
[02:08:44.346 --> 02:08:48.728]  The damn report admits it!
[02:08:48.728 --> 02:08:51.330]  In fact, I'm going to your calls, but let's play this clip.
[02:08:51.330 --> 02:08:57.354]  This is the former deputy director who became the acting director, McCabe.
[02:09:00.558 --> 02:09:06.583]  On CNN last night, and the headlines were, you won't believe what Trump got caught doing with the Russians.
[02:09:06.583 --> 02:09:07.684]  So I'm like, well, what's this?
[02:09:07.684 --> 02:09:09.365]  I knew he'd BS.
[02:09:09.365 --> 02:09:15.670]  Look, he had Lavrov behind the desk where he could get the secrets.
[02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:17.951]  And they're just like, he claims he's not a Russian.
[02:09:17.951 --> 02:09:19.753]  My God, there's a Russian right there.
[02:09:19.753 --> 02:09:22.795]  I mean, you can't let him in the war room.
[02:09:22.795 --> 02:09:26.158]  I mean, they'll see the big board.
[02:09:27.486 --> 02:09:30.007]  This is right out of Dr. Strangelove type stuff.
[02:09:30.007 --> 02:09:31.188]  And then I looked it up.
[02:09:31.188 --> 02:09:35.150]  I typed in Russian foreign ministers, Russian ambassadors in the White House.
[02:09:35.150 --> 02:09:38.432]  And there's all these photos of them at the Oval Desk and all the rest of it.
[02:09:38.432 --> 02:09:45.736]  But McCabe lies and says we've never seen this before because the standard is the president can't talk to the Russians.
[02:09:45.736 --> 02:09:48.477]  If he does that, he's a Russian agent.
[02:09:48.477 --> 02:09:51.979]  When Eisenhower and Kennedy and others are on record getting drunk with him.
[02:09:52.779 --> 02:09:54.080]  You can pull that up in articles.
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:55.341]  Yeah, there's one from BuzzFeed.
[02:09:55.341 --> 02:09:55.921]  Scroll to the bottom.
[02:09:55.921 --> 02:09:57.902]  There's shots of them getting drunk together.
[02:09:57.902 --> 02:10:03.546]  I mean, the idea of all of this is just insane, but that's what they're saying.
[02:10:03.546 --> 02:10:07.128]  And now the Democrats are saying, oh, we're still going to impeach him too for Russia.
[02:10:07.128 --> 02:10:15.253]  I played that first hour.
[02:10:15.253 --> 02:10:18.275]  And you can then find and click each visit and find them in the Oval Office.
[02:10:19.687 --> 02:10:22.729]  Brezhnev, all of them, even though they are getting drunk right there.
[02:10:22.729 --> 02:10:25.230]  I mean, this is just next level, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:25.230 --> 02:10:28.992]  The President can't talk to the Russian Foreign Minister.
[02:10:28.992 --> 02:10:31.333]  He's trying to paralyze everything.
[02:10:34.619 --> 02:10:39.222]  And whenever Trump smiles at a Russian leader, they go, look, he's smiling!
[02:10:39.222 --> 02:10:40.643]  He shook his hand!
[02:10:40.643 --> 02:10:42.164]  What do they say when they talk?
[02:10:42.164 --> 02:10:43.405]  Oh my gosh!
[02:10:43.405 --> 02:10:44.246]  I mean, don't believe me.
[02:10:44.246 --> 02:10:47.048]  Hear it from McCabe.
[02:10:47.048 --> 02:10:49.629]  I mean, you talk about lying to people.
[02:10:49.629 --> 02:10:53.892]  He's like, and the host is putting her head down, just going, I just can't believe it.
[02:11:04.517 --> 02:11:19.269]  This is taking normal behavior and turning it into something bad by these crazy people who openly hate America and tell us they hate the country, but oh, we're impeaching him because he's endangering the nation with his abuse of power.
[02:11:19.269 --> 02:11:26.895]  These are the people that don't want the country to exist in their opening statements, in who they are.
[02:11:26.895 --> 02:11:29.337]  America sucks.
[02:11:29.337 --> 02:11:30.558]  It was never great.
[02:11:30.558 --> 02:11:32.620]  No borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[02:11:32.620 --> 02:11:33.761]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[02:11:34.983 --> 02:11:36.765]  But you gotta see this.
[02:11:36.765 --> 02:11:43.851]  This is McCabe, who reportedly has been indicted, and the deputy head of the Justice Department didn't block it from getting killed months ago.
[02:11:43.851 --> 02:11:45.293]  That's confirmed.
[02:11:45.293 --> 02:11:48.055]  But he's still up there on CNN.
[02:11:48.055 --> 02:11:49.156]  Here it is.
[02:11:49.156 --> 02:11:53.400]  The president, obviously, we've had years go by here that he's spotted and called it a witch hunt and a hoax.
[02:11:54.341 --> 02:11:55.062]  We're good.
[02:12:09.725 --> 02:12:13.128]  Odd about the way this president interacts with Russia.
[02:12:13.128 --> 02:12:15.590]  We have never seen anything like this before.
[02:12:15.590 --> 02:12:24.957]  You go back to the Helsinki meeting, you go back to all the claims that you just made denying the or at least downplaying the effect of Russian meddling in the last election.
[02:12:24.957 --> 02:12:28.299]  I mean, that is just behavior we've never seen from a president.
[02:12:28.299 --> 02:12:31.262]  Russia is our most significant enemy on the world stage.
[02:12:31.262 --> 02:12:35.265]  You've got to be absolutely on your game with each one of your interactions.
[02:12:35.265 --> 02:12:38.187]  I don't think we've ever seen a photograph out of the Oval Office
[02:12:38.487 --> 02:12:44.775]  Along the lines of the one we saw today, with Lavrov essentially almost standing behind the President, behind the Resolute Desk.
[02:12:44.775 --> 02:12:46.036]  It's remarkable.
[02:12:46.036 --> 02:12:53.586]  Maybe outdone only by the last photograph that Lavrov took in the Oval Office, which was taken of course by his own photographer, because we didn't have one there.
[02:12:54.146 --> 02:12:55.907]  And Trump says he brought up election meddling.
[02:12:55.907 --> 02:13:01.609]  Lavrov says that he didn't, but then Lavrov brought it up, and it's unclear exactly what happened.
[02:13:01.609 --> 02:13:07.370]  Lavrov's exact comment was, well, you know, we haven't even actually discussed elections.
[02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:08.211]  What do you think happened?
[02:13:08.211 --> 02:13:21.315]  Do you think that the President of the United States, after years of denying Russian meddling and saying that it could be, you know, some fat person in a basement is his words, do you think that he now suddenly is bringing it up in a serious, meaningful way?
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.101]  Really, really hard to imagine, right?
[02:13:24.101 --> 02:13:44.754]  And I think that, you know, the bigger point here is that this administration has such a terrible record of transparency and readouts from important phone calls and meetings in the White House, and of course a terrible record of dealing with the truth, that when you have a meeting and an incredibly important statement like this that they claim to have made, people can't help but step back and say, well, I'm really not sure.
[02:13:46.696 --> 02:13:50.197]  Oh my gosh, so he denied he's a Russian agent, and then what do you do?
[02:13:50.197 --> 02:13:52.458]  Here he is with them, meeting with them!
[02:13:52.458 --> 02:13:53.198]  I mean, you saw it!
[02:13:53.198 --> 02:13:54.558]  He was talking to one of them!
[02:13:54.558 --> 02:13:56.379]  He had them in there, behind him!
[02:13:56.379 --> 02:14:00.120]  Like all the school kids that come in, and all other foreign leaders!
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:01.240]  Wow!
[02:14:01.240 --> 02:14:10.083]  Man, let me tell you, I was supporting Trump, but after this, I don't know, this is the... I mean, they're paralyzing the President is what's happening.
[02:14:10.083 --> 02:14:12.743]  He can't talk to foreign leaders on the phone.
[02:14:12.743 --> 02:14:14.584]  He can't have people in for a meeting.
[02:14:16.701 --> 02:14:21.523]  I mean, all the presidents have a red phone to Russia and China to talk to whoever they want, whenever they want.
[02:14:21.523 --> 02:14:22.583]  It's constantly going on.
[02:14:22.583 --> 02:14:25.444]  It should be going on.
[02:14:25.444 --> 02:14:28.025]  But when Trump talks to, I mean, I'm done talking about this.
[02:14:28.025 --> 02:14:29.165]  I know the audience gets it.
[02:14:29.165 --> 02:14:30.966]  It's just next level.
[02:14:30.966 --> 02:14:41.690]  And then Andy McCabe is the guy who lied to Congress, who told Trump there was no illegal, there was no investigation going on of him when he knew and was involved running it.
[02:14:42.591 --> 02:14:43.472]  He lied to the President.
[02:14:43.472 --> 02:14:45.193]  He lied to Congress.
[02:14:45.193 --> 02:14:46.554]  He constantly lies.
[02:14:46.554 --> 02:14:56.460]  And he just sits up there and says the President has a problem with truth.
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:58.401]  There's only so much of this crap I can take.
[02:14:58.401 --> 02:15:00.182]  I don't know about you.
[02:15:00.182 --> 02:15:06.807]  But he's raping our President and our freedom and our nation and raping the name of all these agencies
[02:15:08.598 --> 02:15:17.408]  That now, if you think there are bad people in these agencies now, they corrupt these agencies on purpose so that good people get out and then the bad people go and get in.
[02:15:17.408 --> 02:15:18.489]  This is all a process.
[02:15:18.489 --> 02:15:25.817]  The pedophilia, the homelessness, all this globalist garbage is designed to just get you to give up and throw your hands up.
[02:15:25.817 --> 02:15:26.298]  Well, you know what?
[02:15:26.298 --> 02:15:28.740]  I'm not giving up and we're close to bringing these people down.
[02:15:29.341 --> 02:15:31.563]  But man, I'll tell you, I'm not a vindictive, mean person.
[02:15:31.563 --> 02:15:38.210]  I don't wish really harm against anybody, but I really do want to see that arrogant little bastard, Andy McCabe, in an orange jumpsuit.
[02:15:38.210 --> 02:15:39.411]  I want to see him in prison.
[02:15:39.411 --> 02:15:40.852]  I want to see Comey in prison.
[02:15:40.852 --> 02:15:42.434]  I want to see Hillary in prison.
[02:15:42.434 --> 02:15:44.296]  I want to see Brennan more than anybody.
[02:15:44.296 --> 02:15:46.418]  Oh my God, don't you want to see him in prison?
[02:15:46.418 --> 02:15:48.680]  I mean, they are just arrogant scum.
[02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:50.482]  They need to be brought to justice, damn it!
[02:15:54.159 --> 02:15:57.200]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:00.101]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[02:16:00.101 --> 02:16:07.323]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[02:16:07.323 --> 02:16:12.524]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.

[02:18:33.350 --> 02:18:36.913]  And I know I need to stay in the fight, in the attack, attack, attack.
[02:18:37.073 --> 02:18:38.014]  I want to attack.
[02:18:38.014 --> 02:18:39.496]  I want to go after the globalists.
[02:18:39.496 --> 02:18:46.743]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[02:18:46.743 --> 02:18:52.650]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family, because we're in this together!
[02:18:52.650 --> 02:18:53.831]  InfoWareStore.com.
[02:18:55.052 --> 02:19:06.765]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[02:19:06.765 --> 02:19:15.574]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[02:19:16.235 --> 02:19:20.819]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[02:19:20.819 --> 02:19:24.041]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side.
[02:19:24.041 --> 02:19:26.744]  And they do what they do because they're slaves.
[02:19:26.744 --> 02:19:31.808]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[02:19:32.308 --> 02:19:42.236]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[02:19:42.236 --> 02:19:44.978]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[02:19:44.978 --> 02:19:47.559]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[02:19:47.559 --> 02:19:50.662]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[02:19:50.662 --> 02:19:57.387]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[02:19:57.387 --> 02:20:00.029]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.907 --> 02:20:22.571]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:20:22.571 --> 02:20:24.853]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:35.345 --> 02:20:41.087]  Kevin in Los Angeles wants to get into the impeachment process and the Democrats.
[02:20:41.087 --> 02:20:43.747]  So let's go to him right now and then I've got a comment about it.
[02:20:43.747 --> 02:20:53.110]  Mitch McConnell wants to hurry it through and get it done, which is what Trump first said two weeks ago.
[02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:57.892]  And then Trump sees how it's media coverage for weeks and weeks on the other side.
[02:20:57.892 --> 02:20:59.032]  He wants to drag it out.
[02:21:02.839 --> 02:21:03.800]  I have a view on that.
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:06.581]  I'll tell you after the caller gives us his take.
[02:21:06.581 --> 02:21:07.482]  Kevin, thanks for calling.
[02:21:07.482 --> 02:21:08.142]  Thanks for holding.
[02:21:08.142 --> 02:21:09.924]  Welcome.
[02:21:09.924 --> 02:21:11.304]  Hi, Alex.
[02:21:11.304 --> 02:21:17.909]  Yeah, I just want to say, you know, I live in deep in the heart of demon rat territory.
[02:21:17.909 --> 02:21:20.310]  I get to talk to these people almost every single day.
[02:21:20.310 --> 02:21:25.834]  And a vast majority of them are brainwashed, mind controlled.
[02:21:25.834 --> 02:21:26.934]  You can't get through to them.
[02:21:26.934 --> 02:21:29.596]  They won't even talk to you.
[02:21:29.596 --> 02:21:31.037]  I even had my neighbor one day,
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:36.223]  I was talking about impeachment and asking him what he thought about it.
[02:21:36.223 --> 02:21:37.384]  He's a known Democrat.
[02:21:37.384 --> 02:21:38.525]  I know that he is.
[02:21:38.525 --> 02:21:45.350]  He's all for child sexualization, all this stuff that's going on in schools out here.
[02:21:45.350 --> 02:21:50.094]  He can't even give me an answer.
[02:21:50.094 --> 02:21:57.960]  A vast majority of these people just give you a flat out, I don't talk politics.
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:01.503]  And then when you ask them why you don't talk politics, because it's the reason why we're
[02:22:02.521 --> 02:22:08.273]  In this quagmire that we're in, they just walk away, put their hands over their ears.
[02:22:08.273 --> 02:22:08.714]  Well, that's it.
[02:22:08.714 --> 02:22:09.576]  They're just slaves.
[02:22:09.576 --> 02:22:13.103]  They just do what they're told and fight back against those that don't want to be slaves.
[02:22:14.056 --> 02:22:15.818]  Yeah, they don't care.
[02:22:15.818 --> 02:22:20.182]  They have no inkling of what's really going on.
[02:22:20.182 --> 02:22:21.523]  Well that's it, they don't want to care.
[02:22:21.523 --> 02:22:22.524]  They're lost.
[02:22:22.524 --> 02:22:26.327]  They will only stand up to keep us from being free.
[02:22:26.327 --> 02:22:35.296]  They have no energy unless it's meant to make us do something because they fundamentally understand that they're parasites that have joined with the evil that feed off of us.
[02:22:35.296 --> 02:22:36.397]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:22:38.124 --> 02:22:41.325]  They're just downright evil individuals.
[02:22:41.325 --> 02:22:44.366]  It is a spiritual battle that we are facing here.
[02:22:44.366 --> 02:23:02.172]  I'm a Christian, and I gave my life over to God when I was 11 years old, and raised a Baptist, and I have Christian fundamental, you know, I just live my life according to God.
[02:23:03.997 --> 02:23:07.139]  These people are completely and totally ungodless.
[02:23:07.139 --> 02:23:08.820]  They have no God.
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:17.566]  And you ask them if they believe in a higher power or anything else for that matter, they don't even have a straight answer for that.
[02:23:17.566 --> 02:23:22.729]  They're completely lost and delusional, and they just sit and watch TV all day.
[02:23:22.729 --> 02:23:30.514]  This is the thing that I always get into when I'm having conversations with these people is, you know what the most pervasive item
[02:23:31.147 --> 02:23:35.639]  of electronics that is in everyone's home, and it's a television.
[02:23:36.519 --> 02:23:46.566]  And then I go on and I tell them, do you think that the corporations, the massive corporations that fund and run these systems don't have an agenda behind it?
[02:23:46.566 --> 02:23:47.607]  Well, you can turn it on.
[02:23:47.607 --> 02:23:49.408]  It's unified worldwide.
[02:23:49.408 --> 02:23:52.871]  Destroy the family, poison us, literally mutilate our children.
[02:23:52.871 --> 02:23:54.372]  They're putting chemicals in everything.
[02:23:54.372 --> 02:23:57.474]  Now they're publicly saying give us chemicals to sterilize us.
[02:23:57.474 --> 02:24:01.037]  You're absolutely right, Kevin, and it's only going to get worse.
[02:24:01.037 --> 02:24:02.358]  And then those of us that are awake,
[02:24:03.098 --> 02:24:04.819]  Are going to have to rebuild civilization.
[02:24:04.819 --> 02:24:07.380]  And I mean, you're out there in L.A., I'm here in Austin.
[02:24:07.380 --> 02:24:11.402]  To watch how they will collapse the civilization around you is just crazy.
[02:24:11.402 --> 02:24:14.804]  And the madness that they're giving over to is getting worse and worse.
[02:24:14.804 --> 02:24:17.906]  Where, here's the good news, and it's also bad news.
[02:24:17.906 --> 02:24:19.987]  The left is gone off the edge of a cliff.
[02:24:19.987 --> 02:24:21.548]  They're degenerating very, very fast.
[02:24:22.691 --> 02:24:22.771]  Yes.
[02:24:37.964 --> 02:24:42.486]  Once you give yourself over to the spirit of death, the wages of sin are death.
[02:24:42.486 --> 02:24:47.489]  These people are going to, it's already happening, are just going to start committing suicide and dying right in front of us.
[02:24:47.489 --> 02:24:51.491]  And we can't get bummed out by all the evil in ourselves, hurt ourselves, or commit suicide.
[02:24:51.491 --> 02:24:58.955]  We have to serve justice, serve freedom, not worry about ourselves, and stand up for the children, and speak out for them, and we'll be empowered.
[02:24:58.955 --> 02:25:01.356]  God bless you and I appreciate your call.
[02:25:01.356 --> 02:25:02.377]  Here's the point I was going to make.
[02:25:06.314 --> 02:25:09.456]  Yes, impeachment is discrediting the Democrats.
[02:25:09.456 --> 02:25:19.963]  But if Trump lets them expand these hearings in the Senate, they're going to launch a bunch of staged events during the hearings, and they're going to bring forward a bunch of fake witnesses and other scandals.
[02:25:19.963 --> 02:25:25.246]  And so I think McConnell's right just to get this through as fast as possible.
[02:25:25.246 --> 02:25:28.028]  I think, I mean, I think McConnell is right to do that.
[02:25:30.711 --> 02:25:33.312]  But now the Democrats are dragging their feet so it goes through Christmas.
[02:25:33.312 --> 02:25:38.215]  It's just, it's about them dominating reality and making you look at them.
[02:25:38.215 --> 02:25:43.677]  Would anybody really be looking at Pelosi or Nadler or Hillary or listening to them if they hadn't gotten in power?
[02:25:43.677 --> 02:25:46.899]  They want to make you go through them to live.
[02:25:46.899 --> 02:25:50.360]  It's psychic theft is what it is.
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:54.002]  Okay, he's been holding the longest now.
[02:25:54.002 --> 02:25:58.804]  That would be Mike in Texas, then we'll go to Carlos in Canada and Dave in New York.
[02:25:58.804 --> 02:25:59.385]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:25:59.385 --> 02:25:59.965]  Thanks for holding.
[02:26:01.741 --> 02:26:02.501]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:26:02.501 --> 02:26:03.942]  Welcome.
[02:26:03.942 --> 02:26:06.123]  Two things.
[02:26:06.123 --> 02:26:15.508]  I'm not sure if your listeners know, but the time is running out in a couple days on the petition to pardon Roger Stone, so people need to get on the stick on that one.
[02:26:15.508 --> 02:26:24.133]  Number two, I'm curious, whatever happened to Millie Weaver's report on the Kentucky governor's race?
[02:26:24.133 --> 02:26:28.035]  Did the governor decide to fight that?
[02:26:28.035 --> 02:26:30.056]  Are the voters there fighting it?
[02:26:30.056 --> 02:26:30.596]  What's happening?
[02:26:31.306 --> 02:26:49.419]  No, the governor conceded and there was just evidence of total fraud by putting hundreds of thousands of people back on the voter rolls who had never even lived there, including legal aliens, illegal aliens, you name it.
[02:26:49.419 --> 02:26:56.304]  And so she filed a bunch of reports on that.
[02:26:56.304 --> 02:26:57.405]  Does that answer your question, Mike?
[02:26:59.173 --> 02:27:17.341]  Yeah, I just, I was kind of struck by the petition when I went there, I don't know, a week and a half, two weeks ago, that there were only about 14,000 signatures, and I thought, and maybe everyone's just saying, well, someone else is going to, you know, sign on to that petition to... Well, there is a certain fatigue.
[02:27:17.341 --> 02:27:22.103]  I mean, it's really up to President Trump to pardon Roger Stone.
[02:27:22.103 --> 02:27:24.644]  His sentencing is coming up.
[02:27:26.041 --> 02:27:27.722]  In a few months.
[02:27:27.722 --> 02:27:31.305]  And so the word is Trump's going to wait and see what happens at the sentencing.
[02:27:31.305 --> 02:27:34.168]  We're going to be watching that very, very closely.
[02:27:34.168 --> 02:27:40.893]  But yes, I mean, Trump should stand up for Roger Stone, Julian Assange, because these are people that did legal and lawful things.
[02:27:40.893 --> 02:27:44.917]  And, you know, a lot of it was working with the president.
[02:27:44.917 --> 02:27:47.519]  The president did tell Assange to release that information.
[02:27:47.519 --> 02:27:49.501]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:27:49.501 --> 02:27:53.264]  Well, you know, we can at least give a fig leaf of cover to the president to
[02:27:54.285 --> 02:27:55.626]  To part Roger Stone.
[02:27:55.626 --> 02:28:04.951]  I'm sure it's going to drive the Libs crazy when he does it, but if there's at least some public support for it,
[02:28:06.083 --> 02:28:15.486]  You know, there's, like I say, at least a fig leaf of... No, I totally agree with you, but I mean, I don't think he needs the fig leaf, though.
[02:28:15.486 --> 02:28:17.727]  There's no Russian connection.
[02:28:17.727 --> 02:28:21.468]  It's supposedly lying to Congress, saying he never talked to Assange.
[02:28:21.468 --> 02:28:23.809]  Instead, he talked to a guy that talked to him.
[02:28:23.809 --> 02:28:24.830]  That's not illegal.
[02:28:24.830 --> 02:28:25.790]  This is a kangaroo court.
[02:28:25.790 --> 02:28:28.951]  It's like he... A judge found Arpaio guilty.
[02:28:28.951 --> 02:28:29.651]  No jury.
[02:28:29.651 --> 02:28:31.332]  He was facing five years in prison.
[02:28:31.332 --> 02:28:32.572]  And Trump pardoned him.
[02:28:32.572 --> 02:28:34.953]  Trump didn't know about it until I told him.
[02:28:36.038 --> 02:28:37.660]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:28:37.660 --> 02:28:40.423]  And so, we absolutely need to see that happen.
[02:28:40.423 --> 02:28:41.544]  Great points, Mike.
[02:28:41.544 --> 02:28:47.730]  Alright, Dave, HB, Carlos, Danny, Sam, Kyle, Jeff, your calls are all straight ahead on the other side of this break.
[02:28:47.730 --> 02:28:48.571]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:28:48.571 --> 02:28:49.993]  This is the InfoWar.
[02:28:54.031 --> 02:29:05.219]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:05.219 --> 02:29:08.962]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices
[02:29:09.102 --> 02:29:14.524]  On our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:14.524 --> 02:29:19.805]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:19.805 --> 02:29:32.009]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[02:29:32.009 --> 02:29:33.249]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:29:33.249 --> 02:29:35.250]  Check out the PPX microgrid system
[02:29:35.410 --> 02:29:35.990]  That's right.
[02:29:55.020 --> 02:29:58.482]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[02:29:58.482 --> 02:30:00.443]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[02:30:00.443 --> 02:30:03.925]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better.
[02:30:03.925 --> 02:30:06.767]  And that's taking care of our individual health.
[02:30:06.767 --> 02:30:22.557]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to infowarestore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life-changing in what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health,
[02:30:23.157 --> 02:30:28.839]  Your stamina, your libido, but then of course it also funds the info war that is so incredibly critical.
[02:30:28.839 --> 02:30:34.121]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that it's a true 360 win?
[02:30:34.121 --> 02:30:42.004]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[02:30:42.564 --> 02:30:50.312]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at InfowarStore.com.
[02:30:50.312 --> 02:30:52.154]  That's InfowarStore.com.
[02:30:52.154 --> 02:30:53.576]  Please make the right decision.
[02:30:54.884 --> 02:30:58.107]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[02:30:58.107 --> 02:31:15.503]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[02:31:15.503 --> 02:31:16.844]  We're being taken off the land.
[02:31:17.705 --> 02:31:28.353]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[02:31:28.353 --> 02:31:37.480]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:41.583]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[02:31:41.583 --> 02:31:46.068]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[02:31:46.068 --> 02:31:47.930]  This is the post-human error.
[02:31:47.930 --> 02:31:50.712]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[02:31:50.712 --> 02:31:52.154]  This is the crossroads.
[02:31:52.154 --> 02:31:53.995]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[02:31:54.796 --> 02:32:01.642]  At current sales rates, we're going to sell out of Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus by the end of the year.
[02:32:01.642 --> 02:32:12.891]  But despite that, I'm still offering it at 65% off for those of you that have never experienced what is in the Real Red Pill and in the Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:32:13.451 --> 02:32:18.918]  There is no one formula that you're going to find out there that is more game-changing.
[02:32:18.918 --> 02:32:21.401]  It's 65% off right now.
[02:32:21.401 --> 02:32:27.449]  That's very close to cost with a free bottle of our best-selling BioTrue Selenium for the mustard seed.
[02:32:27.449 --> 02:32:28.370]  These two formulas go
[02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.750]  I think so.
[02:32:58.317 --> 02:33:01.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:07.623]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:07.623 --> 02:33:16.049]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowars.
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:30.801]  I'm somebody that likes to mind my own business.
[02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:41.603]  But if I find out somebody's hurting innocent people, and if I find out somebody's organizing evil, I'm going to oppose them.
[02:33:41.603 --> 02:33:51.845]  Because I get that kind of instinct to not want to be at the forefront, to not want to grandstand, to not want to raise the alarm, to not want to yell and scream.
[02:33:55.120 --> 02:33:59.062]  But that's what you're supposed to do when you got big problems.
[02:33:59.062 --> 02:34:15.670]  And so I'm sitting here looking at all the stuff going on and we need to expose the evil and the fact that it's being organized by really bad people who enjoy carrying out evil because good people have not done anything that creates a vacuum where evil takes over.
[02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:19.292]  This is just science.
[02:34:19.292 --> 02:34:22.794]  And then it's only going to get worse till we oppose it.
[02:34:22.794 --> 02:34:24.375]  So yeah, it's a long, hard haul.
[02:34:25.592 --> 02:34:27.293]  It's the Animating Contest of Liberty.
[02:34:27.293 --> 02:34:31.894]  But it's just like jogging or lifting weights or building a cabin in the woods.
[02:34:31.894 --> 02:34:36.976]  I mean, you put the labors into something, you get great results back from it.
[02:34:36.976 --> 02:34:39.577]  I'm going to your calls here in a moment.
[02:34:39.577 --> 02:34:44.478]  I have not really done any photo shoots or video shoots in shorts and a t-shirt.
[02:34:44.478 --> 02:34:46.839]  I'm going to do some, I think, next week.
[02:34:46.839 --> 02:34:48.280]  I haven't weighed in a couple weeks.
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:53.621]  Last time I checked, I lost about 32 pounds in the last 90 days.
[02:34:53.621 --> 02:34:54.962]  Now it's been about a hundred and...
[02:34:56.597 --> 02:35:01.558]  10 days since I've been religiously taking the supplements.
[02:35:01.558 --> 02:35:03.439]  And that's really the big change I've made.
[02:35:03.439 --> 02:35:15.923]  And I know I lost more weight than that now because all of my pants are falling off, including 36s.
[02:35:15.923 --> 02:35:19.264]  So, and I was up to 42s.
[02:35:19.264 --> 02:35:23.525]  And a few years before that, where I initially lost some weight, I was about 44s about 10 years ago.
[02:35:26.087 --> 02:35:29.931]  So I'm at 36 right now.
[02:35:29.931 --> 02:35:32.814]  And it's baggy in the legs until you get up to my rear end.
[02:35:32.814 --> 02:35:35.297]  It's still pretty big.
[02:35:35.297 --> 02:35:35.877]  Big muscles.
[02:35:35.877 --> 02:35:39.581]  But the products really are amazing.
[02:35:39.581 --> 02:35:45.267]  And when I'm pissed off and want to unscrew somebody's head, I just bang.
[02:35:45.267 --> 02:35:46.008]  Took some krill oil.
[02:35:47.202 --> 02:35:50.043]  And 30 minutes later, I'm already feeling it and feel calm.
[02:35:50.043 --> 02:35:51.924]  It gives you calm energy.
[02:35:51.924 --> 02:35:55.545]  And that's what the write-ups about high-quality krill oil and fish oil.
[02:35:55.545 --> 02:35:59.746]  Krill is even stronger, you know, for every amount you take.
[02:35:59.746 --> 02:36:01.907]  It's at InfoWarsTore.com 50% off.
[02:36:01.907 --> 02:36:05.588]  We are now into day number three of the 12 days of Christmas.

[02:36:39.732 --> 02:36:41.974]  There's too many to get into all of them.
[02:36:41.974 --> 02:36:44.597]  And I'm just going to leave it at that and trust that you'll make the right decisions.
[02:36:44.597 --> 02:36:48.221]  And thank you for, I mean, look at how we're hitting on all cylinders.
[02:36:48.221 --> 02:36:51.244]  Our reporters are all over the news again today, getting key questions out.
[02:36:52.104 --> 02:36:57.607]  Uh, took over the Trump rally, got in the face of the leftists, got viral videos out of that, informing everybody.
[02:36:57.607 --> 02:37:03.549]  It's information war, uh, spurring others to go out and be vocal and hit the streets.
[02:37:03.549 --> 02:37:06.451]  But 327 days out of the election, our mission is beyond critical.
[02:37:06.451 --> 02:37:07.151]  You understand it.
[02:37:07.151 --> 02:37:07.871]  You know it.
[02:37:07.871 --> 02:37:13.514]  For me, though, I've got to really sit back and take a breath and go, wow.
[02:37:13.514 --> 02:37:16.935]  I felt led by God 26, 7 years ago to get on air.
[02:37:16.935 --> 02:37:17.996]  Took me a couple of years to get on air.
[02:37:17.996 --> 02:37:19.637]  And 25 years later,
[02:37:23.131 --> 02:37:27.098]  We've all done some incredible things and it's all because you thought we could change the world with me.
[02:37:27.098 --> 02:37:29.041]  I mean really, that's the magic.
[02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:35.904]  We can pray all day to God, and we know God's real, and God gives us discernment and providence, but God counts on us.
[02:37:35.904 --> 02:37:39.887]  God works through us, and I think about what we've done just on a daily basis.
[02:37:39.887 --> 02:37:41.448]  I should be euphoric.
[02:37:41.448 --> 02:37:47.672]  Instead, I'm completely driven and pissed off, and I'm not doing enough, but that's why we are game-changing.
[02:37:47.672 --> 02:37:57.279]  I mean, all of our reporters are just kicking ash because we really came to fight, and it's your prayers that are literally energizing our reporters.
[02:37:59.059 --> 02:38:10.526]  I'm not going to get into it, I'm going to go to your calls, but my discernment has gone way up to almost, I'm like, God, this is a little too much.
[02:38:10.526 --> 02:38:12.647]  Like, can you back off a little bit?
[02:38:12.647 --> 02:38:14.469]  It's like, no, you said you wanted this here.
[02:38:14.469 --> 02:38:15.569]  You want that?
[02:38:15.569 --> 02:38:16.890]  And it's getting wild.
[02:38:16.890 --> 02:38:18.791]  And I'm trying to gauge it and deal with it and handle it.
[02:38:18.791 --> 02:38:21.753]  And I apologize, I'm a jerk sometimes on air and off.
[02:38:21.753 --> 02:38:27.176]  It's because just talk about like, it's like being autistic where there's just so much data coming in, so much happening.
[02:38:28.377 --> 02:38:29.658]  Because, you know, because you care!
[02:38:29.658 --> 02:38:31.439]  You're not sticking your head in the sand.
[02:38:31.439 --> 02:38:38.024]  I get why a lot of people clam up, because reality's intense.
[02:38:38.024 --> 02:38:38.805]  But you know what?
[02:38:38.805 --> 02:38:43.408]  Living in a false reality is called spiritual death, and I will not be part of it.
[02:38:43.408 --> 02:38:47.191]  But it is intense, and I know it's intense, and you're intense, and I'm very honored you're listening and watching.
[02:38:47.191 --> 02:38:49.813]  I love you, I appreciate you, and I am humble.
[02:38:50.612 --> 02:38:51.252]  For your support.
[02:38:51.252 --> 02:38:51.833]  God bless you.
[02:38:51.833 --> 02:39:02.397]  But I, I'll admit it, seeing how we just get better and better and more effective, now I am just enraged by them trying to shut us down behind the scenes and the stuff that's going on.
[02:39:02.397 --> 02:39:04.157]  And just, I've got to control it.
[02:39:04.157 --> 02:39:10.520]  And I pray to God to just get me where I'm not, like a race car driver that keeps going at 8,000 RPMs, you know, half the race, the engine blows.
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:15.202]  We've got to just, you know, cool it back a little bit sometimes.
[02:39:15.202 --> 02:39:16.042]  All right.
[02:39:16.042 --> 02:39:17.103]  Who's been home the longest now?
[02:39:19.352 --> 02:39:21.813]  That'd be Kyle in Texas and then Carlos in Canada.
[02:39:21.813 --> 02:39:24.313]  Kyle, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:39:24.313 --> 02:39:24.913]  Hello, Alex.
[02:39:24.913 --> 02:39:25.493]  Can you hear me?
[02:39:25.493 --> 02:39:25.873]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:25.873 --> 02:39:27.794]  Thanks for calling.
[02:39:27.794 --> 02:39:29.634]  Thank you for having me.
[02:39:29.634 --> 02:39:30.594]  My name is Kyle.
[02:39:30.594 --> 02:39:32.675]  I'm 22 years old and I live in Dallas, Texas.
[02:39:32.675 --> 02:39:46.398]  And Alex, I'm contacting you today right now because we have the most huge opportunity that we as humans have ever had in our lives.
[02:39:46.398 --> 02:39:48.378]  We have the opportunity to literally
[02:39:49.184 --> 02:39:51.565]  Turn our dreams into reality.
[02:39:51.565 --> 02:39:59.547]  Alex, you don't understand how powerful and just how big this moment is.
[02:39:59.547 --> 02:40:07.269]  We have the ability to actually expose what's happening in our government, the people that own our grocery stores, the people that own our restaurants.
[02:40:07.269 --> 02:40:10.470]  We have the ability to really make a change.
[02:40:10.470 --> 02:40:11.830]  So I'm contacting you.
[02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:15.451]  I told your producers I'm contacting you about ideas, and I know
[02:40:16.016 --> 02:40:21.680]  What I know, I have ideas and immediate things that I know can help my brothers and sisters.
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:26.203]  And Alex, I heard you were saying you're tired of people being lazy and stupid.
[02:40:26.203 --> 02:40:28.505]  But Alex, I'm telling you, I grew up in poverty.
[02:40:28.505 --> 02:40:29.706]  You know, I'm from Texas.
[02:40:29.706 --> 02:40:31.387]  I'm black and white.
[02:40:31.387 --> 02:40:35.770]  And Alex, what it really is, is no one has ever just had to help.
[02:40:35.770 --> 02:40:38.992]  Alex, I mean, and I don't look down for it.
[02:40:38.992 --> 02:40:40.894]  You've grown up with a way.
[02:40:40.894 --> 02:40:41.114]  You've
[02:40:41.576 --> 02:40:50.845]  You've never, I mean actually I've never known you, so I don't know if you've ever had a struggle for food and stuff, but Alex, you don't understand how powerful it is to finally know the truth of our reality.
[02:40:50.845 --> 02:40:53.087]  You know, like it, my grandfather... No, you're right.
[02:40:53.087 --> 02:40:58.712]  We can look at people that have never had a chance to see reality, living in Plato's cave, and say, what's their problem?
[02:40:58.712 --> 02:41:02.735]  But I understand they've been in the dark so long that you can't blame them because they just don't know.
[02:41:02.735 --> 02:41:05.218]  That's why Christ said we have to set the captives free.
[02:41:07.153 --> 02:41:07.633]  No, I hear you.
[02:41:07.633 --> 02:41:08.474]  Hey, don't worry.
[02:41:08.474 --> 02:41:10.615]  God did not pamper me growing up.
[02:41:10.615 --> 02:41:14.577]  So, and I had a lot of little special, special training sessions God gave me.
[02:41:14.577 --> 02:41:16.638]  So, I'm definitely not sheltered, my friend.
[02:41:16.638 --> 02:41:17.979]  I've seen things few people have.
[02:41:17.979 --> 02:41:19.720]  Believe me.
[02:41:19.720 --> 02:41:20.300]  Yep.
[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:31.046]  And so, I'm, like I say, if I can, I would love to talk to you in the middle of this break for literally a minute if I could just, you know, like... Well, brother, you're live on air and I'm glad you care and we love you to death.
[02:41:31.046 --> 02:41:31.826]  But just get to it.
[02:41:31.826 --> 02:41:32.447]  What's going on?
[02:41:32.447 --> 02:41:32.687]  Tell me.
[02:41:34.369 --> 02:41:37.171]  Alex, look, we can do it now.
[02:41:37.171 --> 02:41:39.052]  Look, it's simple.
[02:41:39.052 --> 02:41:43.494]  You remember Bill Cooper, Bob Marley, JFK, Tupac.
[02:41:43.494 --> 02:41:44.275]  People have died.
[02:41:44.275 --> 02:41:49.038]  It's just a simple fact that you need to realize you are a chosen one, Alex.
[02:41:49.038 --> 02:41:55.041]  You are the Martin Luther King and Jesus of our time.
[02:41:55.041 --> 02:41:56.942]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:41:56.942 --> 02:41:58.483]  I wouldn't compare Martin Luther King to Jesus.
[02:41:58.483 --> 02:42:02.145]  Listen, what I'm telling you is that everybody's waking up.
[02:42:03.052 --> 02:42:05.635]  That's just because I woke up longer ago than other people waking up now.
[02:42:05.635 --> 02:42:06.476]  It's all the exact same thing.
[02:42:06.476 --> 02:42:08.137]  We have a relationship with Christ.
[02:42:08.137 --> 02:42:11.321]  And you're right, God's Spirit's coming into the world a lot stronger.
[02:42:11.321 --> 02:42:17.507]  But we don't want to ever confuse the people with God that God is shining through in little limited ways.
[02:42:17.507 --> 02:42:19.830]  Compare, but I hear what you're saying and it's exciting.
[02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:25.175]  And so now is the time to tell people, do you want the pro-human future or the pro-Satan future?
[02:42:25.876 --> 02:42:27.237]  And really decide which side we're on.
[02:42:27.237 --> 02:42:28.938]  And I think that choosing is what's there.
[02:42:28.938 --> 02:42:29.839]  Write me a letter.
[02:42:29.839 --> 02:42:31.460]  I read most of them that come in.
[02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:32.440]  PO Box is on the deal.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:33.281]  Call me back again.
[02:42:33.281 --> 02:42:34.562]  I understand you're excited.
[02:42:34.562 --> 02:42:35.663]  Too much to cover at all.
[02:42:35.663 --> 02:42:36.563]  More calls coming up.
[02:42:36.563 --> 02:42:36.863]  Thank you.
[02:42:36.863 --> 02:42:38.344]  God bless you.
[02:42:38.344 --> 02:42:38.725]  All right.
[02:42:38.725 --> 02:42:39.905]  Tons of calls straight ahead.
[02:42:39.905 --> 02:42:41.366]  And I'm going to host a little bit of the next hour.
[02:42:41.366 --> 02:42:43.448]  Then Mike Adams is always informative.
[02:42:43.448 --> 02:42:44.408]  He's beyond informative.
[02:42:44.408 --> 02:42:45.609]  He has been.
[02:42:45.609 --> 02:42:47.050]  Everybody's on fire that's a guest here.
[02:42:47.050 --> 02:42:49.732]  But he has been absolutely like a flamethrower of truth.
[02:42:49.732 --> 02:42:52.374]  With these many documentaries he's been making at Band.Video.
[02:42:54.213 --> 02:42:55.054]  Andy in Florida.
[02:42:55.054 --> 02:42:55.654]  Thank you, Andy.
[02:42:55.654 --> 02:42:56.735]  Go ahead.
[02:42:56.735 --> 02:42:57.355]  Hey, Alex.
[02:42:57.355 --> 02:42:58.135]  I love you, man.
[02:42:58.135 --> 02:42:58.756]  We love you.
[02:42:58.756 --> 02:43:02.738]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic at hand, I gotta talk about one of your products.
[02:43:02.738 --> 02:43:04.299]  A little bit about me.
[02:43:04.299 --> 02:43:04.899]  I'm 245 pounds.
[02:43:04.899 --> 02:43:07.901]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[02:43:07.901 --> 02:43:11.203]  And to make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[02:43:11.203 --> 02:43:15.686]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[02:43:16.186 --> 02:43:16.446]  I think so.
[02:43:31.568 --> 02:43:33.969]  We're really proud of TurboForce, so thank you, sir.
[02:43:33.969 --> 02:43:37.110]  Commit to buy a lot of your products at InfoWarsTore.com, then help us spread the word.

[02:44:57.836 --> 02:44:59.638]  Real Red Pill.
[02:44:59.638 --> 02:45:01.820]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:16.893]  Please go to infowarshore.com and research the preglanone alone that is in each of these products and then research all the other things that are in Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus and what they will do for you and your family.
[02:45:17.253 --> 02:45:32.291]  This Christmas, for those of you on the fence who've never tried these products, I am selling both of the formulas at 65% off, the lowest price ever, with a free bottle of BioTrue Selenium, with it from the mustard seed.
[02:45:32.291 --> 02:45:35.775]  Ladies and gentlemen, research what this does in your body.
[02:45:36.355 --> 02:45:39.438]  Then experience it for yourself if you want to go to the next level.
[02:45:39.438 --> 02:45:42.061]  I'd say it funds the InfoWar before losing money on this.
[02:45:42.061 --> 02:45:48.147]  This is my gift to you this Christmas so you experience it for yourself like the other products.
[02:45:48.147 --> 02:45:50.129]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:45:50.129 --> 02:45:51.811]  That's InfoWarStore.com.
[02:45:51.811 --> 02:45:52.672]  Please take action.
[02:45:55.512 --> 02:45:58.715]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:16.132]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[02:46:16.132 --> 02:46:17.473]  We're being taken off the land.
[02:46:18.334 --> 02:46:28.982]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[02:46:28.982 --> 02:46:38.109]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[02:46:38.869 --> 02:46:42.210]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[02:46:42.210 --> 02:46:46.691]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[02:46:46.691 --> 02:46:48.551]  This is the post-human error.
[02:46:48.551 --> 02:46:51.312]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[02:46:51.312 --> 02:46:52.772]  This is the crossroads.
[02:46:52.772 --> 02:46:57.893]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[02:46:57.893 --> 02:47:00.554]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.098 --> 02:47:20.224]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:47:20.224 --> 02:47:21.846]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:25.865 --> 02:47:27.046]  Cox Adams is coming up.
[02:47:27.046 --> 02:47:28.147]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:47:28.147 --> 02:47:29.588]  Don't forget the War Room.
[02:47:29.588 --> 02:47:32.710]  Norma Thoen-Schroyer, he'll be on it today from the road.
[02:47:32.710 --> 02:47:34.231]  They're in D.C.
[02:47:34.231 --> 02:47:37.253]  Also, they're going to New York, covering all the impeachment garbage.
[02:47:37.253 --> 02:47:39.715]  Savannah Hernandez is hosting and doing a great job.
[02:47:39.715 --> 02:47:43.377]  Infowars.com forward slash show, band dot video, and on radio and TV stations.
[02:47:43.377 --> 02:47:45.118]  They pick it up across the country.
[02:47:45.118 --> 02:47:46.699]  Okay, Sam in Texas and Carlos.
[02:47:46.699 --> 02:47:48.260]  Sam in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:47:48.260 --> 02:47:48.861]  Thanks for holding.
[02:47:50.270 --> 02:48:00.315]  There are new levels of wokeness when someone comes into the info war, and the higher ones are getting back to God, studying the faith, looking again into the Bible.
[02:48:00.315 --> 02:48:14.143]  You know, all these glitterbug preachers, everybody's figured out that their purpose is to steal their money, but there's a social plan that goes along with that too, and that is to ruin and scald people so that once they're burned,
[02:48:14.523 --> 02:48:16.444]  They give up on community.
[02:48:16.444 --> 02:48:21.725]  They give up especially on financial partnership and on giving.
[02:48:21.725 --> 02:48:22.446]  Absolutely.
[02:48:22.446 --> 02:48:30.928]  That's why Sanders and Warren are trying to ban the tax deductions for Christmas giving.
[02:48:30.928 --> 02:48:31.568]  You're absolutely right.
[02:48:31.568 --> 02:48:35.950]  The whole modern church is about turning people away from God.
[02:48:35.950 --> 02:48:36.390]  Absolutely.
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:38.601]  That's a fact.
[02:48:38.601 --> 02:48:40.823]  And I just encourage people to reach out.
[02:48:40.823 --> 02:48:54.894]  If you're one of these people that doesn't fellowship, and maybe once was around a fellowship, and you were a giver, and then you just saw that the whole thing was a shill, I would say, God's economy is giving.
[02:48:54.894 --> 02:48:55.855]  Make some new friends.
[02:48:56.275 --> 02:48:59.258]  If you don't want to join a Bible study, start your own.
[02:48:59.258 --> 02:49:01.000]  Oh, that's a great point.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.224]  If you don't want to be with all these cliques and weirdos, start it yourself.
[02:49:04.224 --> 02:49:05.626]  But here's what's even more important.
[02:49:05.626 --> 02:49:12.493]  There's a major revival happening right now, and it's not from people that are like Pharisees who just want power and control.
[02:49:13.334 --> 02:49:16.877]  People are having a relationship with God, and people see the evil.
[02:49:16.877 --> 02:49:31.427]  I know a lot of atheists and people that are becoming real Christians, and they hear this show, they're like, yeah, we don't like mainline church, we don't like all the, you know, the can't, and all the thumping, and all the we're better than you, and you know, that's just another form of political correctness.
[02:49:31.787 --> 02:49:38.716]  But a real relationship with God and saying, I don't want to be with the devil, I don't want to be with the pedophiles, I don't want to be with... People know that Satan's real and evil.
[02:49:38.716 --> 02:49:40.858]  They're running, trying to find God.
[02:49:40.858 --> 02:49:47.086]  Well, like Christ said, you're not going to find it in that synagogue of, you know, Satan, when he was pointing at that church run by corrupt Pharisees.
[02:49:47.086 --> 02:49:47.667]  That's in the Bible.
[02:49:48.127 --> 02:49:50.768]  He said you're going to find it with a personal relationship.
[02:49:50.768 --> 02:49:54.969]  The kingdom of heaven is within you when you make that contact with God.
[02:49:54.969 --> 02:49:57.049]  Then you find your brothers and sisters.
[02:49:57.049 --> 02:50:00.330]  And that's why he went to the tax collectors and the prostitutes and everybody.
[02:50:00.330 --> 02:50:02.811]  Not that he was endorsing tax collectors and prostitutes.
[02:50:02.811 --> 02:50:04.431]  They were the most hated groups.
[02:50:04.431 --> 02:50:09.233]  But he was going to them to find people that weren't trying to take control of the church of that day.
[02:50:09.233 --> 02:50:09.813]  Does that make sense?
[02:50:10.925 --> 02:50:12.106]  A hundred percent.
[02:50:12.106 --> 02:50:25.702]  Today I am in the eighth chapter of the book of Judges, a book that's full of wars, and we can look at these books, look at these stories, and see how God delivered, how his prophets and how his lion warriors prevailed against their enemies.
[02:50:26.102 --> 02:50:36.768]  By the way, in that particular one, they caught 77 princes of the city, put them in the stocks and chastised them, whipped them with thorns and briars of the desert.
[02:50:36.768 --> 02:50:40.030]  So we want to talk about dealing with the deep state.
[02:50:40.030 --> 02:50:48.995]  The typology is in the Bible again and again and again and again, but the point I want to leave the listeners with is, if you're not giving financially,
[02:50:49.557 --> 02:50:52.560]  You're not part of the solution that God wants you to be.
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:54.702]  And you know, you don't have to give to Alex Jones.
[02:50:54.702 --> 02:50:56.364]  I encourage that, and I do.
[02:50:56.364 --> 02:50:58.906]  But you can even pick one of the young reporters.
[02:50:58.906 --> 02:51:00.628]  Pick somebody, reach out to them.
[02:51:00.628 --> 02:51:02.350]  They've all got Patreons.
[02:51:02.350 --> 02:51:06.034]  You know, so many are out there that host this or that show.
[02:51:06.034 --> 02:51:07.415]  Savannah's out there.
[02:51:07.415 --> 02:51:08.276]  Millie's out there.
[02:51:09.724 --> 02:51:11.265]  They've all got a Patreon.
[02:51:11.265 --> 02:51:17.792]  You can reach out to them and be a partner and be a friend and we can rebuild society before the doo-doo hits the fan.
[02:51:17.792 --> 02:51:18.873]  Sam, beautifully said.
[02:51:18.873 --> 02:51:19.393]  God bless you.
[02:51:19.393 --> 02:51:21.855]  I gotta jump into everybody because Mike Adams is coming up.
[02:51:21.855 --> 02:51:24.418]  Let me just say this.
[02:51:24.418 --> 02:51:30.604]  People ask, well, why does Millie Weaver and why does Caitlin Bennett have Patreons if they're your reporters?
[02:51:32.324 --> 02:51:35.885]  The Travel is $100,000 a loan for Caitlyn.
[02:51:35.885 --> 02:51:37.205]  She wants to work every day.
[02:51:37.205 --> 02:51:39.146]  Everywhere she goes, she gets 200,000, 300,000, 400,000 views.
[02:51:39.146 --> 02:51:44.927]  I walk through the store and people are like, oh, we love Caitlyn Bennett.
[02:51:44.927 --> 02:51:46.047]  She's got a two-person crew.
[02:51:46.047 --> 02:51:47.568]  That's three of them.
[02:51:47.568 --> 02:51:49.608]  They stay at $40, $50 a night hotels.
[02:51:53.328 --> 02:51:53.588]  I don't
[02:52:11.067 --> 02:52:11.307]  I don't know.
[02:52:34.676 --> 02:52:44.601]  I mean, it takes a lot to send them all up there to these events, to have the armored vehicle up there, to have two security guys, they both drive the vehicle, with the truck that big and he's trying to look out the window on the other side so you don't run folks over.
[02:52:44.601 --> 02:52:51.784]  But we've got a team of like 10 people on the East Coast right now.
[02:52:51.784 --> 02:52:55.586]  And it's just plane tickets and armored vehicles and everything.
[02:52:55.586 --> 02:52:57.847]  People say, why do we have an armored vehicle?
[02:52:58.908 --> 02:53:01.370]  It's already paid for half itself in the last few months.
[02:53:01.370 --> 02:53:06.854]  We can see the numbers coming in from the traffic and purchases of items that then we plow right back into the fight.
[02:53:06.854 --> 02:53:08.815]  But this is a war, and it takes money.
[02:53:08.815 --> 02:53:11.477]  I've had Hillary Clinton's law firms pull all this.
[02:53:11.477 --> 02:53:13.498]  We've beaten most of their fake lawsuits.
[02:53:13.498 --> 02:53:17.461]  But they've got it railroaded on a lot of fronts, and I've got plans.
[02:53:17.461 --> 02:53:20.003]  I can keep the transmissions going indefinitely.
[02:53:20.003 --> 02:53:23.906]  I just need a lot of capital, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:53:23.906 --> 02:53:27.368]  A lot of new things are you're going to see three, four months.
[02:53:27.368 --> 02:53:28.069]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[02:53:28.929 --> 02:53:30.210]  A lot of stuff.
[02:53:30.210 --> 02:53:32.893]  Okay, and I'm not going to get into strategy and things like that here.
[02:53:32.893 --> 02:53:34.895]  The enemy's watching right now.
[02:53:34.895 --> 02:53:41.561]  But believe me, them messing with us the way they have and death-threatening me and all the scams they pulled have not made me not have energy.
[02:53:41.561 --> 02:53:41.862]  In fact...
[02:53:42.907 --> 02:53:44.108]  It's the opposite.
[02:53:44.108 --> 02:53:45.489]  And so you've got my commitment.
[02:53:45.489 --> 02:53:48.172]  I have never been this focused.
[02:53:48.172 --> 02:53:49.994]  I have never been this aggressive.
[02:53:49.994 --> 02:53:52.176]  I can't handle it.
[02:53:52.176 --> 02:53:53.277]  I'll be honest with you.
[02:53:53.277 --> 02:53:55.038]  I mean, it's too intense right now.
[02:53:55.038 --> 02:53:56.700]  I jump out of bed at 5 a.m.
[02:53:56.700 --> 02:53:58.221]  like a jumping jack.
[02:53:58.221 --> 02:53:59.823]  I have to make myself go to sleep.
[02:53:59.823 --> 02:54:01.424]  I want to fight, fight, fight.
[02:54:01.424 --> 02:54:02.545]  I'm never giving up.
[02:54:02.545 --> 02:54:03.486]  These people are so evil.
[02:54:03.486 --> 02:54:05.848]  How the hell could we roll over to these people?
[02:54:05.848 --> 02:54:06.689]  It's not going to happen.
[02:54:08.362 --> 02:54:14.131]  I can feel your will and strength rising up and it's amazing and I'm so thankful.
[02:54:14.131 --> 02:54:15.233]  We've got to stay in this game.
[02:54:16.349 --> 02:54:20.751]  Just do your Christmas shopping with us, folks, and support our local MNF stations and thank them as well.
[02:54:20.751 --> 02:54:22.391]  And absolutely start your own shows.
[02:54:22.391 --> 02:54:23.852]  Go to City Council and speak.
[02:54:23.852 --> 02:54:24.912]  Go to Congress and speak.
[02:54:24.912 --> 02:54:25.893]  Just get out there.
[02:54:25.893 --> 02:54:26.993]  Be leaders.
[02:54:26.993 --> 02:54:27.873]  I'm looking for the leaders.
[02:54:27.873 --> 02:54:28.954]  You know who you are.
[02:54:28.954 --> 02:54:30.514]  Don't count on us to do it all.
[02:54:30.514 --> 02:54:40.558]  But the biggest way you can fund and know you're kicking ass on the front lines, money is temporarily in this world the number one thing that when you do it,
[02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:43.810]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:55:06.663 --> 02:55:12.708]  You have a great team, and I wish them all the best for the holidays, for Christmas, and yourself.
[02:55:12.708 --> 02:55:13.969]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:36.738 --> 02:55:37.958]  That's what it is.
[02:55:37.958 --> 02:55:50.122]  It's the old Leo Strauss idea that you lie, you get people all muddled up, confused, the school of neocons coming out, big force.
[02:55:50.122 --> 02:56:00.545]  You have a power transition that has been deliberately aborted because of the fact that the people that were loyal to the Democrats for eight years,
[02:56:01.398 --> 02:56:10.462]  We're told, hey, listen, wink at a nod, you stay there and bring down this president 90 days, we'll get him out of office, we'll impeach him, we'll get him out.
[02:56:10.462 --> 02:56:16.765]  And they run into a man who didn't have enough support, enough people that he could put in place.
[02:56:16.765 --> 02:56:18.466]  Dr. Pyshennik has said it over and over.
[02:56:18.908 --> 02:56:18.988]  Yes.
[02:56:37.378 --> 02:56:39.699]  In my opinion, what you're experiencing.
[02:56:39.699 --> 02:56:44.341]  And they keep throwing all these lies, and we keep returning them like tennis balls.
[02:56:44.341 --> 02:56:46.322]  And they keep us lying and lying.
[02:56:46.322 --> 02:56:46.722]  That's right.
[02:56:46.722 --> 02:56:58.107]  They stay in charge because they set the agenda by always firing new lies that we respond to, instead of action and indictments and going and taking the communist rats down.
[02:56:58.107 --> 02:57:00.028]  And your Chicago Business School model, 110%
[02:57:02.129 --> 02:57:04.730]  The neocons out of the Trotskyites.
[02:57:04.730 --> 02:57:06.470]  They say that's who they are.
[02:57:06.470 --> 02:57:08.871]  And it's neocons behind the Democrats.
[02:57:08.871 --> 02:57:10.091]  And that's why Trump's in danger.
[02:57:10.091 --> 02:57:12.172]  But they haven't gotten him out of power.
[02:57:12.172 --> 02:57:13.912]  It's a stalemate.
[02:57:13.912 --> 02:57:19.934]  And so I want to ask you when we come back, Carlos, your smart cookie, where you think this is going next and what Trump needs to do now.
[02:57:19.934 --> 02:57:20.954]  Carlos is very smart.
[02:57:22.805 --> 02:57:24.345]  And so are these other amazing callers.
[02:57:24.345 --> 02:57:29.487]  He'll finish up, then I'm going to go to HB, Dave, Jim, Jeff, Ross, and Danny.
[02:57:29.487 --> 02:57:32.648]  But that's it, because Mike Adams is on at 15 after.
[02:57:32.648 --> 02:57:35.729]  And let me tell you, I just cannot say enough about Mike Adams.
[02:57:35.729 --> 02:57:40.090]  He's gone from being excellent to being as good as I've ever seen.
[02:57:40.090 --> 02:57:40.730]  It's amazing.
[02:57:40.730 --> 02:57:42.431]  He's up in his game in the face of the tyranny.
[02:57:44.602 --> 02:57:49.086]  Driving into the operations center this morning, it just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[02:57:49.086 --> 02:57:53.149]  I need to reach directly out of the audience and just spell out the facts.
[02:57:53.149 --> 02:58:01.876]  When you spend your money at places like Dick's Sporting Goods, you're financing a group that gives huge amounts of money to gun control, disarming you and your family.
[02:58:02.516 --> 02:58:07.801]  When you go down the list and look at these companies like Walmart, did you know they're doing the same thing now?
[02:58:07.801 --> 02:58:16.490]  Did you know that almost every big box store, including Target, they're the worst, are actually funding the transgender movement targeting children?
[02:58:16.490 --> 02:58:18.972]  Do you know what Jeff Bezos and Amazon's up to?
[02:58:19.893 --> 02:58:22.254]  Ladies and gentlemen, it'll make your head spin.
[02:58:22.254 --> 02:58:25.896]  Why in the hell are we supporting these people?
[02:58:25.896 --> 02:58:33.219]  Why are you going to buy your Christmas presents for your family from these institutions that hate America and hate your guts?
[02:58:33.219 --> 02:58:36.760]  Do your shopping at infowarsstore.com and get great products.
[02:58:36.760 --> 02:58:41.862]  And then rest assured, you're funding the resistance, you're funding the voice of liberty in the face of tyranny.
[02:58:41.862 --> 02:58:43.363]  Please shop at infowarsstore.com.
[02:58:45.376 --> 02:58:47.258]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[02:58:47.258 --> 02:58:49.079]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[02:58:49.079 --> 02:58:52.041]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs.
[02:58:52.041 --> 02:58:52.622]  Spiritually.
[02:58:52.622 --> 02:58:54.664]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[02:58:54.664 --> 02:58:56.205]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[02:58:57.853 --> 02:59:01.015]  In a fight where it's gonna have more power per dollar.
[02:59:27.933 --> 02:59:29.354]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:59.364 --> 03:00:01.286]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:01.286 --> 03:00:07.511]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:15.174 --> 03:00:17.216]  Carlos, finishing up, I mean, you're laying it out.
[03:00:17.216 --> 03:00:24.964]  We have a rogue network, a deep state neocon and leftist that openly now brag that they're going to remove Trump and block what he wants to do and block the American people.
[03:00:24.964 --> 03:00:26.626]  And they say, thank God for the deep state.
[03:00:26.626 --> 03:00:29.389]  Thank God we disregard the flyover country and the president.
[03:00:29.389 --> 03:00:30.770]  And that's flagrantly illegal.
[03:00:30.770 --> 03:00:31.791]  So it should backfire.
[03:00:31.791 --> 03:00:35.535]  They should all be removed and go to prison.
[03:00:35.535 --> 03:00:38.258]  But if Trump starts losing the stalemate,
[03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:40.250]  That's right Alex.
[03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:42.012]  Well, Trump has to understand, first of all, that
[03:01:08.706 --> 03:01:13.591]  When you're looking at communism, surveillance was everything.
[03:01:13.591 --> 03:01:18.536]  And surveillance denies people the right to communicate and speak.
[03:01:18.536 --> 03:01:23.161]  And when you have surveillance and you can identify people, they're in fear.
[03:01:23.161 --> 03:01:26.804]  So you deny them the freedom to be informed.
[03:01:26.804 --> 03:01:29.948]  Now, democracy is more than just a single vote.
[03:01:29.948 --> 03:01:32.010]  Democracy is the right to be heard.
[03:01:33.149 --> 03:01:40.853]  The right to have an informed vote and surveillance and denial of speech is certainly against democracy.
[03:01:40.853 --> 03:01:46.836]  And then the third thing is that once you have a decision made through democracy, you're supposed to obey it.
[03:01:46.836 --> 03:01:54.320]  You're not supposed to use your personnel and loyalties from previous administrations to attack the President of the United States.
[03:01:54.360 --> 03:01:58.268]  Yeah, that's called a coup, and now they're all out in the open.
[03:01:58.268 --> 03:02:04.219]  I don't see how they can survive now that they're this exposed, unless we convert to pure communism, as you just said.
[03:02:05.563 --> 03:02:16.810]  The President of the United States has the power and the wherewithal to educate the people on the values of democracy, on the values of the Constitution.
[03:02:16.810 --> 03:02:33.079]  I don't think President Trump has dedicated two or three weeks of educating the people about the Constitution, the Washingtonian view of what it's to be American, and the ideas that will eliminate these communist efforts.
[03:02:33.079 --> 03:02:34.180]  Look, if you remember,
[03:02:34.967 --> 03:02:44.593]  Stalin said, it's not the vote, it's not he who votes that counts, it's he who counts the votes that counts.
[03:02:44.593 --> 03:02:47.235]  That's a very, very important line to keep in mind.
[03:02:47.235 --> 03:02:51.878]  And that's what they're doing and they've been caught and we know it and you're absolutely right.
[03:02:51.878 --> 03:03:01.184]  And Trump must do almost nightly fireside chats and directly himself lay all this out and get people organized to remove these people.
[03:03:01.184 --> 03:03:02.765]  We have, America has cancer.
[03:03:03.744 --> 03:03:07.790]  And they've been emboldened, the deep state, by all their open criminal activity.
[03:03:07.790 --> 03:03:09.973]  And let me ask you this, Carlos, quickly.
[03:03:09.973 --> 03:03:16.401]  When this impeachment fails, and I believe it will, they've got some wild cards, but it's failing now, what will they do next?
[03:03:16.401 --> 03:03:20.607]  What will they only keep upping the ante in their maniac behavior because no one stops them?
[03:03:22.301 --> 03:03:30.044]  They will increase the effort to silence people like Infowars or anybody else who has a different opinion.
[03:03:30.044 --> 03:03:36.346]  Because when you have a different opinion, they'll call you names, they'll say you're an anti-this or an anti-that.
[03:03:36.346 --> 03:03:48.651]  But the thing is this, in Soviet Russia, in Stalinist Russia, to disagree with someone, to say they would call you an anti-Semite, was a criminal offense punishable with death.
[03:03:49.341 --> 03:03:52.283]  Now, if you look at the AVL, that's where they're taking you.
[03:03:52.283 --> 03:03:58.328]  They're taking you, slowly but surely, to make a criminal offense, to even say, I disagree with you.
[03:03:58.328 --> 03:03:59.909]  And they'll say, well, that's anti-Semitic.
[03:03:59.909 --> 03:04:00.950]  Well, there you are.
[03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:05.393]  Now, this is all the school of communism coming from Chicago.
[03:04:05.393 --> 03:04:14.200]  And President, past President Obama, really should have transitioned the country over to the new president, regardless of how he felt.
[03:04:14.611 --> 03:04:17.512]  And said, look, we're behind the new president, go home.
[03:04:17.512 --> 03:04:21.014]  But of course they didn't, showing how this country is in deep crisis.
[03:04:21.014 --> 03:04:22.715]  Wow, Carlos, amazing call.
[03:04:22.715 --> 03:04:26.717]  We ought to just take that call and post it to Bandod Video.
[03:04:26.717 --> 03:04:30.378]  Because, I don't know how... Carlos, you still there?
[03:04:30.378 --> 03:04:30.878]  Yes, I am.
[03:04:30.878 --> 03:04:33.780]  What should we title this video?
[03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:37.922]  Communism is the waft coming from Chicago.
[03:04:37.922 --> 03:04:38.582]  Communism...
[03:04:41.484 --> 03:04:46.212]  Or the Deep State gets its blueprints from Chicago communists or something like that.
[03:04:46.212 --> 03:04:47.134]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[03:04:47.134 --> 03:04:47.555]  Stay with us.
[03:04:47.555 --> 03:04:48.276]  Mike Adams coming up.

[03:05:46.830 --> 03:05:49.371]  There's a story up on InfoWars.com where Trump has tweeted out
[03:06:17.896 --> 03:06:25.501]  A Avengers Comics in-game Thanos meme.
[03:06:25.501 --> 03:06:32.606]  Who's like the villain, and it's trolling the Democrats, and they're all freaking out.
[03:06:32.606 --> 03:06:36.129]  And saying, oh my god, he's a dictator, he's coming for us.
[03:06:36.129 --> 03:06:42.073]  It's called a joke, but you know, they have mainline sites now that fact check comedians.
[03:06:42.073 --> 03:06:45.936]  And it's the arrogance of the system where they're gonna ban memes, they're gonna
[03:06:47.111 --> 03:06:51.074]  In addition to all the lies and all the blustering at tonight's rally, Trump's war room posted a meme on Twitter today.
[03:07:16.022 --> 03:07:21.305]  Showing Trump as the supervillain Thanos from the Marvel Avengers movies.
[03:07:21.305 --> 03:07:24.707]  Dispatching his democratic enemies.
[03:07:24.707 --> 03:07:32.532]  Take a look at this.
[03:07:32.532 --> 03:07:37.415]  I am inevitable.
[03:07:37.415 --> 03:07:42.898]  On this solemn day, I recall that the first board of business from members of the
[03:07:54.211 --> 03:07:56.132]  What are we, in junior high school?
[03:07:56.132 --> 03:07:58.393]  Like, what the hell?
[03:07:58.393 --> 03:08:01.755]  What is this?
[03:08:01.755 --> 03:08:04.377]  Like, what?
[03:08:04.377 --> 03:08:05.117]  What?
[03:08:05.117 --> 03:08:05.417]  What?
[03:08:05.417 --> 03:08:15.243]  I cannot believe that I'm even having to report this on the news.
[03:08:15.243 --> 03:08:18.064]  I know.
[03:08:18.064 --> 03:08:20.165]  I can't even believe no one's watching.
[03:08:20.165 --> 03:08:20.625]  It's like 100,000 viewers.
[03:08:20.625 --> 03:08:20.746]  Crazy.
[03:08:20.746 --> 03:08:20.846]  Crazy.
[03:08:24.591 --> 03:08:26.932]  This is literally crazy.
[03:08:26.932 --> 03:08:28.112]  Are you people insane?
[03:08:28.112 --> 03:08:37.676]  Are you insane?
[03:08:37.676 --> 03:08:38.736]  Go ahead.
[03:08:38.736 --> 03:08:40.577]  Troll the Democrats on Twitter.
[03:08:40.577 --> 03:08:44.678]  Do this stupid, silly... You know what?
[03:08:44.678 --> 03:08:46.359]  That's got you freaking out.
[03:08:46.359 --> 03:08:50.620]  Play this stupid, juvenile, meme game.
[03:08:50.620 --> 03:08:52.081]  Because you take yourself so serious.
[03:08:53.351 --> 03:08:59.015]  History won't record this mean, stupid crap.
[03:08:59.015 --> 03:09:01.497]  But history will record this.
[03:09:01.497 --> 03:09:04.559]  The seriousness of what is happening.
[03:09:04.559 --> 03:09:09.683]  That today is the day that the House of Representatives in the United States of America
[03:09:10.820 --> 03:09:25.423]  Introduced articles of impeachment against President Donald J. Trump, the President of the United States of America, for committing high crimes and misdemeanors.
[03:09:25.423 --> 03:09:29.264]  High crimes and misdemeanors, and I love to hear my voice.
[03:09:29.264 --> 03:09:32.045]  I love to hear myself talk.
[03:09:32.045 --> 03:09:33.485]  Oh, this is so incredible.
[03:09:34.927 --> 03:09:37.869]  They're the people that constantly attack free speech.
[03:09:37.869 --> 03:09:39.990]  They're the people that want to shut everybody down.
[03:09:39.990 --> 03:09:44.172]  They're the people that call for violence against Trump and myself and his family.
[03:09:44.172 --> 03:09:47.174]  And then somebody puts out a joke meme.
[03:09:47.174 --> 03:09:51.657]  Trump repurposes it, puts it out as a joke, saying we're not worried about that.
[03:09:51.657 --> 03:09:54.378]  They are falling on their faces.
[03:09:54.378 --> 03:09:56.179]  He says, you heard the tell.
[03:09:56.179 --> 03:09:59.261]  History.
[03:09:59.261 --> 03:10:00.782]  History.
[03:10:00.782 --> 03:10:02.183]  Won't remember your meme.
[03:10:02.183 --> 03:10:04.324]  I guess that means Google, erase that immediately!
[03:10:05.486 --> 03:10:07.927]  Delist all the Clinton death lists!
[03:10:07.927 --> 03:10:13.028]  Delist Paul Krugman saying Trump will never get the economy to 3%!
[03:10:13.028 --> 03:10:18.950]  Just delist everything because history will remember me, Don Lemon, not you!
[03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:21.551]  Not you, me!
[03:10:21.551 --> 03:10:24.812]  Well really, on Twitter that's got like 4 million views right now.
[03:10:24.812 --> 03:10:26.332]  I'm talking about 50 million.
[03:10:26.332 --> 03:10:27.433]  Dude, you've got like 100,000 viewers.
[03:10:27.433 --> 03:10:32.714]  CNN used to have 10 million viewers an hour.
[03:10:35.367 --> 03:10:36.868]  You're a joke!
[03:10:36.868 --> 03:10:38.810]  People aren't tuning out because of competition.
[03:10:38.810 --> 03:10:44.375]  They're tuning out because a bunch of pretentious people like you are BORING!
[03:10:44.375 --> 03:10:45.976]  BORING!
[03:10:45.976 --> 03:10:49.039]  BORING!
[03:10:49.039 --> 03:10:58.027]  The highest ratings that CNN ever had when it came to political guests.
[03:10:58.027 --> 03:11:00.809]  They even had a national story about it in 2013.
[03:11:00.809 --> 03:11:01.570]  Since their decline.
[03:11:01.570 --> 03:11:02.931]  It was when I was on Piers Morgan.
[03:11:05.017 --> 03:11:08.439]  And for a week, they had triple the viewers after I came on.
[03:11:08.439 --> 03:11:11.001]  Because I destroyed him.
[03:11:11.001 --> 03:11:13.202]  I chewed him up and spit him out.
[03:11:13.202 --> 03:11:15.784]  And that's why they're like, oh, Jones is banned from any show.
[03:11:15.784 --> 03:11:19.686]  Because I won't sit there and go along with their talking points.
[03:11:19.686 --> 03:11:23.869]  Bunch of pretentious trash.
[03:11:23.869 --> 03:11:25.070]  Got Mike Adams waiting in the wings.
[03:11:25.070 --> 03:11:25.870]  He's been on the longest show.
[03:11:25.870 --> 03:11:26.671]  I really appreciate you guys.
[03:11:26.671 --> 03:11:27.271]  I'm trying to get everybody.
[03:11:27.271 --> 03:11:28.392]  I'm getting better about calls, aren't I?
[03:11:28.392 --> 03:11:29.472]  A little bit better.
[03:11:29.472 --> 03:11:32.254]  HB in FEMA Region 4.
[03:11:32.254 --> 03:11:32.975]  HB, thanks for holding.
[03:11:32.975 --> 03:11:33.235]  Go ahead.
[03:11:34.739 --> 03:11:35.980]  Alex, good to talk to you again.
[03:11:35.980 --> 03:11:37.560]  You woke my wife and I up in 08.
[03:11:37.560 --> 03:11:39.961]  Appreciate that.
[03:11:39.961 --> 03:11:41.882]  I'll just blast him out here.
[03:11:41.882 --> 03:11:43.042]  Free Roger Stone.
[03:11:43.042 --> 03:11:50.685]  I wish Trump could get a hold of the big media and get us a TV station on TV.
[03:11:50.685 --> 03:11:56.447]  But really my question was, how come Biden's quid pro quo, I can't say it, in Ukraine,
[03:11:57.324 --> 03:11:59.284]  It's not mentioned by anyone anywhere anymore.
[03:11:59.284 --> 03:11:59.884]  You covered it.
[03:11:59.884 --> 03:12:01.325]  You covered him saying it.
[03:12:01.325 --> 03:12:03.845]  Because if you're a Democrat, you're allowed to do whatever you want.
[03:12:03.845 --> 03:12:04.845]  That's why.
[03:12:04.845 --> 03:12:05.505]  That's right.
[03:12:05.505 --> 03:12:06.046]  That's right.
[03:12:06.046 --> 03:12:10.866]  And that's the same reason Hillary hasn't gotten in trouble for selling uranium to Russia.
[03:12:10.866 --> 03:12:14.467]  You know, everybody's lied to Congress and no charges against anybody.
[03:12:14.467 --> 03:12:15.187]  I'm getting tired of it.
[03:12:15.187 --> 03:12:18.288]  You think Trump will pull the trigger in 20?
[03:12:18.288 --> 03:12:21.628]  I mean, he's trying to pull the trigger right now and it's going click, click, click.
[03:12:21.628 --> 03:12:22.328]  It's misfiring.
[03:12:22.328 --> 03:12:24.309]  I mean, he definitely is the real deal.
[03:12:25.791 --> 03:12:26.392]  I don't know.
[03:12:26.392 --> 03:12:32.437]  I just know we've got to keep the pressure on them, brother, and we've got to get everybody to vote, and we've got to expose election fraud, because look at all they've done.
[03:12:32.437 --> 03:12:33.618]  You think they're going to cheat?
[03:12:33.618 --> 03:12:34.499]  They've been caught cheating.
[03:12:34.499 --> 03:12:35.019]  God bless you.
[03:12:35.019 --> 03:12:35.800]  Great points, HP.
[03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:36.861]  Thanks for holding.
[03:12:36.861 --> 03:12:37.922]  All right, Dave in New York.
[03:12:37.922 --> 03:12:38.482]  Dave, you're on the air.
[03:12:38.482 --> 03:12:40.064]  Go ahead.
[03:12:40.064 --> 03:12:41.105]  Hi, Alex.
[03:12:41.105 --> 03:12:43.347]  Thanks for having me.
[03:12:43.347 --> 03:12:49.893]  We keep hearing about serious failures or illegal spying or FISA abuse of power.
[03:12:51.220 --> 03:12:53.741]  I think we'd all be better off if we just called it what it is.
[03:12:53.741 --> 03:12:54.981]  It's perjury.
[03:12:54.981 --> 03:13:08.024]  And if we can't convict or prosecute these people for perjury, for misrepresenting something to a court, I mean, I'm a little afraid we're going to lose, but you're the best.
[03:13:08.024 --> 03:13:08.864]  I love listening to you.
[03:13:08.864 --> 03:13:09.944]  You're my spiritual guide.
[03:13:09.944 --> 03:13:11.164]  Thanks for the time.
[03:13:11.164 --> 03:13:12.144]  No, no, Dave, don't hang up.
[03:13:12.144 --> 03:13:14.845]  The listeners are my spiritual guide, but seriously.
[03:13:16.274 --> 03:13:16.894]  You're right.
[03:13:16.894 --> 03:13:20.357]  Did you notice since this report came out, the lies got even crazier?
[03:13:20.357 --> 03:13:22.078]  By McCabe and Comey.
[03:13:22.078 --> 03:13:24.440]  Like, there was never even spying at all, the report says.
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:25.661]  It doesn't say that.
[03:13:25.661 --> 03:13:27.222]  Trump's got Russians running the White House.
[03:13:27.222 --> 03:13:27.543]  Look at them.
[03:13:27.543 --> 03:13:30.605]  I mean, it's only encouraged them to get more flagrant, hasn't it?
[03:13:31.345 --> 03:13:31.866]  Definitely.
[03:13:31.866 --> 03:13:44.919]  And the best was when you told that story the other day about a guy walking in, seeing something going on with his wife that was clear as day, and the guy who was doing it to his wife gets up and says, you stole my car.
[03:13:44.919 --> 03:13:46.901]  That was the best story.
[03:13:46.901 --> 03:13:49.523]  And that's what's maddening.
[03:13:49.523 --> 03:13:53.127]  Every night I'm looking at it going, am I losing my mind?
[03:13:53.127 --> 03:13:54.208]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:13:54.912 --> 03:13:57.353]  Well, that's because you're cogent and smart, Dave, and you know what's going on.
[03:13:57.353 --> 03:13:58.414]  I mean, listen to you.
[03:13:58.414 --> 03:13:59.394]  You can form a sentence.
[03:13:59.394 --> 03:14:00.235]  I can form a sentence.
[03:14:00.235 --> 03:14:02.976]  You go to a leftist event, they can't talk now.
[03:14:02.976 --> 03:14:03.576]  It's scary.
[03:14:03.576 --> 03:14:04.137]  God bless you.
[03:14:04.137 --> 03:14:07.258]  I'm trying to get everybody in here.
[03:14:07.258 --> 03:14:08.659]  Let's go ahead and go to Jeff in Tennessee.
[03:14:08.659 --> 03:14:09.159]  Thanks for holding.
[03:14:09.159 --> 03:14:10.940]  Go ahead.
[03:14:10.940 --> 03:14:11.640]  Hello, Alex.
[03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:12.661]  How are you?
[03:14:12.661 --> 03:14:14.082]  I'm a mixed bag.
[03:14:14.082 --> 03:14:16.743]  How are you?
[03:14:16.743 --> 03:14:17.343]  Aggravated.
[03:14:17.343 --> 03:14:17.984]  Yeah.
[03:14:17.984 --> 03:14:19.444]  You know, we sit here and
[03:14:21.553 --> 03:14:26.935]  We watch all of these hearings and stuff going on.
[03:14:26.935 --> 03:14:35.439]  You know, why have they not, the guy before the last one that come on there, he actually said the questions that I had.
[03:14:35.439 --> 03:14:37.280]  What about Hillary Clinton?
[03:14:37.280 --> 03:14:42.502]  Why has she not been brought forth on anything?
[03:14:42.502 --> 03:14:44.723]  The emails, the uranium.
[03:14:45.874 --> 03:14:49.777]  Because he works for the globalists that had already thought this country was done for.
[03:14:49.777 --> 03:14:59.164]  That's why it's so great Trump's in there, because literally they were slamming the door shut, and we put a doorstop in, that's what Trump is, like you stick your foot in the door, we stuck our foot in the door.
[03:14:59.164 --> 03:15:08.651]  That's what's happening, and they're trying to slam the door on our foot right now, and we've got to just sit there and take the pain and keep our foot in it, and ask the public, hey help us get the door open here.
[03:15:08.651 --> 03:15:09.472]  Yes sir.
[03:15:09.472 --> 03:15:11.514]  Now, another problem.
[03:15:11.514 --> 03:15:11.734]  You know,
[03:15:12.455 --> 03:15:21.140]  Obama, I made the statement here to all my friends back before the election in 2016 that Obama never would leave office.
[03:15:22.009 --> 03:15:24.071]  He really has not left off.
[03:15:24.071 --> 03:15:26.372]  You know, that's profound.
[03:15:26.372 --> 03:15:27.633]  I've said that before.
[03:15:27.633 --> 03:15:28.073]  You're right.
[03:15:28.073 --> 03:15:28.534]  God bless you.
[03:15:28.534 --> 03:15:30.175]  I'm sorry to Jim and Danny.
[03:15:30.175 --> 03:15:30.976]  Get their numbers and info.
[03:15:30.976 --> 03:15:32.397]  They want me to call them back first thing tomorrow.
[03:15:32.397 --> 03:15:34.158]  I'll get them first back on.
[03:15:34.158 --> 03:15:35.719]  Mike Adams is loaded for bear, as always.
[03:15:35.719 --> 03:15:36.640]  He's taking over in just a minute.
[03:15:36.640 --> 03:15:40.462]  Please don't forget, you don't shop with us and you shop with the big globalists, you're crazy.
[03:15:40.462 --> 03:15:42.124]  We've got great items in FortWorthStore.com.
[03:15:42.124 --> 03:15:42.904]  Big sales right now.
[03:15:42.904 --> 03:15:45.306]  And you've got the War Room coming up after that today.
[03:15:45.306 --> 03:15:47.167]  So much is going to be popping and breaking.
[03:15:47.167 --> 03:15:47.908]  So please stay with us.
[03:15:51.977 --> 03:15:53.197]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:53.197 --> 03:15:57.119]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:57.119 --> 03:15:58.660]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.660 --> 03:16:01.621]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.621 --> 03:16:07.183]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:07.183 --> 03:16:08.383]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.383 --> 03:16:11.324]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.324 --> 03:16:13.545]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.545 --> 03:16:17.987]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[03:16:23.068 --> 03:16:24.349]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:28.092]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[03:16:28.092 --> 03:16:29.173]  Forget bunkers.
[03:16:29.173 --> 03:16:31.015]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[03:16:31.015 --> 03:16:32.716]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[03:17:54.153 --> 03:17:57.495]  The last few days I've been online looking for the speech.
[03:17:57.495 --> 03:18:06.180]  I actually read it in a book about Winston Churchill many years ago, and I've found a few places where it's mentioned, but if you can find it, please send it to showtipstemforwars.com.
[03:18:06.180 --> 03:18:15.425]  And he talked about in the darkest hours at the beginning of World War II, the fact that there have been times in history where people had a chance to stand up and fight early on and were assured of victory.
[03:18:15.425 --> 03:18:21.588]  Then there was a second point in history where folks have to fight even though the chances of winning are pretty steep.
[03:18:21.588 --> 03:18:22.489]  There's a third time
[03:18:23.209 --> 03:18:29.274]  When you know you're going to lose, but you have to fight because being enslaved and being slowly killed is much, much worse.
[03:18:29.274 --> 03:18:30.615]  That's a paraphrase.
[03:18:30.615 --> 03:18:38.881]  But ladies and gentlemen, we are in the position now of being able to win this easily if we find our spirit, find our focus, and don't give up and take action.
[03:18:38.881 --> 03:18:44.405]  But if we don't stand up and get involved, we're going to skip number two and go right to number three.
[03:18:44.405 --> 03:18:45.326]  That's a fact.
[03:18:45.326 --> 03:18:47.968]  They fear Infowars because we are alive.
[03:18:47.968 --> 03:18:50.650]  It's time for the world to awaken and take back our future.
[03:18:52.904 --> 03:19:04.609]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[03:19:04.609 --> 03:19:13.413]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[03:19:14.093 --> 03:19:18.659]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[03:19:18.659 --> 03:19:24.587]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[03:19:24.587 --> 03:19:29.674]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[03:19:30.154 --> 03:19:40.077]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[03:19:40.077 --> 03:19:42.817]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[03:19:42.817 --> 03:19:45.398]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[03:19:45.398 --> 03:19:48.499]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[03:19:48.499 --> 03:19:55.841]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[03:19:55.841 --> 03:19:58.502]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:09.011 --> 03:20:15.696]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[03:20:15.696 --> 03:20:17.998]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:20:17.998 --> 03:20:22.782]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.782 --> 03:20:26.225]  All right, Mike Adams is stepping in here for the remainder of the fourth hour today.
[03:20:26.225 --> 03:20:27.806]  Thank you for joining me.
[03:20:27.806 --> 03:20:32.610]  I was hearing some of the callers in the previous segment talking with Alex.
[03:20:32.610 --> 03:20:37.253]  I gotta tell you, the InfoWars listeners and fans are the greatest people in America.
[03:20:38.698 --> 03:20:51.586]  It literally, it puts a smile on my face, makes me feel inspired for humanity when I hear people called in and be so thoughtful and be so aware and have such courage knowing what's coming and having the courage to face it.
[03:20:51.586 --> 03:20:53.667]  Because you can see where this is going.
[03:20:53.667 --> 03:20:55.568]  The Democrats cannot coexist.
[03:20:56.292 --> 03:20:59.493]  With conservatives or Christians or gun owners or Trump supporters.
[03:20:59.493 --> 03:21:00.874]  They cannot coexist.
[03:21:00.874 --> 03:21:04.156]  The Democrats have the philosophy of genocide.
[03:21:04.156 --> 03:21:15.481]  And I'm going to talk about that today and why it is up to us, we the people, the real Americans, to stand up against that genocidal mania of the radical left-wing Democrats.
[03:21:15.481 --> 03:21:18.222]  And it's going to start, I now believe, in Virginia.
[03:21:18.222 --> 03:21:20.443]  And I've just posted an article on this.
[03:21:20.443 --> 03:21:23.064]  I'll cover that article in a few minutes.
[03:21:23.064 --> 03:21:25.005]  It's about Governor Northam now.
[03:21:25.911 --> 03:21:34.934]  My analysis is he's building a kill list of patriots to exterminate, but he's calling it a gun registration list.
[03:21:34.934 --> 03:21:36.655]  It's actually a kill list.
[03:21:36.655 --> 03:21:38.435]  It's actually genocide.
[03:21:38.435 --> 03:21:42.937]  This is the governor that murders born-alive human babies.
[03:21:42.937 --> 03:21:47.418]  And if they're willing to kill human babies, they're willing to kill you in the streets.
[03:21:47.418 --> 03:21:49.059]  Have no illusions about it.
[03:21:49.059 --> 03:21:50.039]  I'll be talking about that.
[03:21:50.539 --> 03:21:57.781]  In the next segment here on InfoWars.com, but first a couple other breaking news items that are very important.
[03:21:57.781 --> 03:22:08.743]  Part of my goal is to give you the tools so that you can express yourself, you can bypass censorship, you can share important information, and you can find important information.
[03:22:08.743 --> 03:22:15.725]  And of course, as a contributor here to InfoWars, I've always done my part to help InfoWars information get out there as well.
[03:22:18.238 --> 03:22:18.958]  Good news.
[03:22:18.958 --> 03:22:20.519]  It's exploding in popularity.
[03:22:20.519 --> 03:22:22.080]  It's the alternative to YouTube.
[03:22:22.080 --> 03:22:25.702]  It's like Band.Video, except anybody can join.
[03:22:25.702 --> 03:22:27.543]  And I have to apologize.
[03:22:27.543 --> 03:22:31.925]  The video transcoding time is now two hours of wait, because so many people are using it.
[03:22:31.925 --> 03:22:36.667]  But Steve Quayle has just moved over 500 videos in process over to Brighteon.
[03:22:36.667 --> 03:22:38.628]  Alan Keyes has launched his channel there.
[03:22:38.628 --> 03:22:40.389]  Children's Health Defense is there.
[03:22:40.389 --> 03:22:47.272]  InfoWars and Alex Jones is the number one channel on Brighteon.com, even bigger than my own channel, Health Ranger Report.
[03:22:47.904 --> 03:22:52.309]  But I gotta tell you, Brighton is exploding now because of the censorship of YouTube.
[03:22:52.309 --> 03:22:53.350]  And you can use it.
[03:22:53.350 --> 03:22:54.331]  It's free to use.
[03:22:54.331 --> 03:22:55.973]  We got our costs under control.
[03:22:55.973 --> 03:22:58.295]  We're no longer losing money on that platform.
[03:22:58.295 --> 03:23:01.438]  We're not making any money, but it's breaking even and that's good enough.
[03:23:01.438 --> 03:23:02.880]  That's all we need.
[03:23:02.880 --> 03:23:04.381]  So you can use that.
[03:23:04.381 --> 03:23:05.182]  Do it.
[03:23:05.182 --> 03:23:05.783]  Join up.
[03:23:05.783 --> 03:23:07.044]  Express yourself.
[03:23:07.044 --> 03:23:08.025]  Exercise free speech.
[03:23:08.025 --> 03:23:09.667]  You're not going to be censored for being a patriot there.
[03:23:10.638 --> 03:23:11.679]  The second thing.
[03:23:11.679 --> 03:23:15.261]  Oh, and also, look, share the videos on Band.Video.
[03:23:15.261 --> 03:23:16.722]  I've got a channel there, too.
[03:23:16.722 --> 03:23:19.343]  All the InfoWars guests and hosts have channels there.
[03:23:19.343 --> 03:23:21.384]  All the shows are represented there.
[03:23:21.384 --> 03:23:22.265]  Share those channels.
[03:23:22.265 --> 03:23:23.846]  Bypass censorship.
[03:23:23.846 --> 03:23:28.849]  And I believe the plan is for Band.Video to, over time, open up to more and more people.
[03:23:28.849 --> 03:23:33.951]  I'm not the R&D staff there, so I don't know for sure what the schedule is, but I've heard that that's the plan.
[03:23:33.951 --> 03:23:36.433]  All right, secondly, and by the... I mean,
[03:23:37.210 --> 03:23:39.173]  Why promote YouTube videos?
[03:23:39.173 --> 03:23:44.240]  Why are you using YouTube when you could be using Band.Video or Brighttown.com or other alternatives?
[03:23:44.240 --> 03:23:45.222]  That's the key.
[03:23:45.222 --> 03:23:49.388]  Just stop using the globalist tools like YouTube and Google and so on.
[03:23:49.388 --> 03:23:50.049]  You already know that.
[03:23:50.049 --> 03:23:50.289]  I know.
[03:23:50.289 --> 03:23:53.273]  You're the most informed audience in the world.
[03:23:53.273 --> 03:23:53.674]  Secondly,
[03:23:54.835 --> 03:24:08.403]  I'm releasing a new search engine that's going to compete with Google on the topic of health and vaccines, chemtrails, anything related to health and wellness, including geoengineering, including GMOs, including pharmaceuticals.
[03:24:08.403 --> 03:24:13.486]  And today I'll announce the URL of that new search engine, which launches at the end of this year.
[03:24:13.486 --> 03:24:21.051]  InfoWars will be indexed and InfoWars Store will be indexed as well, because InfoWars Store offers all these natural health products.
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:29.222]  When you are searching for solutions like iodine, you'll be able to find InfoWars store or other retailers that are offering natural products as well.
[03:24:29.222 --> 03:24:32.162]  That URL is webseed.com.
[03:24:32.162 --> 03:24:37.604]  Webseed, just like it sounds, W-E-B-S-E-E-D dot com.
[03:24:37.604 --> 03:24:42.085]  InfoWars will be indexed, Mercola is being indexed, of course, Natural News.
[03:24:42.085 --> 03:24:47.286]  And I got to tell you, there will be hundreds of natural health websites there that are all being banned by Google.
[03:24:48.189 --> 03:25:03.036]  And our plan is, throughout 2020, to expand that search engine to other topics such as pro-Second Amendment, survival and prepping, politics, and many other topics that are currently being heavily censored by the powers that be.
[03:25:03.843 --> 03:25:08.325]  And the reason I mention this here is, number one, this will help promote info wars.
[03:25:08.325 --> 03:25:11.566]  This will help promote alternative, truthful information.
[03:25:11.566 --> 03:25:13.827]  Look, we are the real journalists in America.
[03:25:13.827 --> 03:25:14.807]  You know this.
[03:25:14.807 --> 03:25:16.568]  We are the ones telling the truth.
[03:25:16.568 --> 03:25:20.170]  I mean, if anything, just look at the hearings today of Horowitz in the Senate.
[03:25:20.170 --> 03:25:31.174]  It came out that, yes, the FBI relied solely on the Steele dossier, which is completely discredited, in order to justify the FISA warrants and the illegal spying on the Trump administration.
[03:25:31.872 --> 03:25:38.556]  But dozens of mainstream news outlets, including the New York Times and the Washington Post, all said that that wasn't true.
[03:25:38.556 --> 03:25:43.420]  That there was many pieces of evidence that justify the FBI spying.
[03:25:43.420 --> 03:25:44.740]  Well, guess what?
[03:25:44.740 --> 03:25:47.882]  Today we know that all those media outlets are fake news.
[03:25:47.882 --> 03:25:49.684]  Guess who told the truth?
[03:25:49.684 --> 03:25:51.365]  Alex Jones told the truth.
[03:25:51.365 --> 03:25:52.726]  David Knight told the truth.
[03:25:52.726 --> 03:25:54.627]  Owen Schroer told the truth.
[03:25:54.627 --> 03:25:56.228]  InfoWars brought you the truth.
[03:25:57.142 --> 03:26:00.523]  We are the real media in America, or part of the real media.
[03:26:00.523 --> 03:26:10.285]  The independent, alternative media is the real media, including One America News that did an outstanding report the other day about corruption with Burisma in Ukraine and Yovanovitch and so on.
[03:26:10.285 --> 03:26:12.966]  Just an outstanding video report.
[03:26:12.966 --> 03:26:16.447]  I'm sorry, I forgot the name of the reporter who did that report, but it was outstanding.
[03:26:16.447 --> 03:26:16.927]  The point is,
[03:26:17.972 --> 03:26:28.522]  What I'm going to be doing from here forward, folks, is not just coming in and giving you updates here on InfoWars, but building tools and building platforms that all of us can use.
[03:26:28.522 --> 03:26:30.464]  And we have the means to do it.
[03:26:30.464 --> 03:26:32.826]  We put millions of dollars into it, and it's working.
[03:26:33.206 --> 03:26:44.054]  We are sustainable, thanks to your support, and we have tools that can help set you free and bypass the tyrannical authoritarian censorship that's only getting worse by the day.
[03:26:44.054 --> 03:26:50.059]  Like YouTube recently said, well, they can cut off your channel if you're not, quote, commercially viable.
[03:26:50.059 --> 03:26:52.701]  Well, how do they make you not commercially viable?
[03:26:52.701 --> 03:26:54.882]  They demonetize your platform.
[03:26:54.882 --> 03:26:56.964]  And then they say, well, gosh, you're not making us any money.
[03:26:56.964 --> 03:26:59.886]  Your gun videos are not commercially viable.
[03:26:59.886 --> 03:27:01.007]  And why aren't they commercially viable?
[03:27:01.007 --> 03:27:02.508]  Because they cut you off from the revenues.
[03:27:03.399 --> 03:27:05.721]  I mean, it's a Catch-22 trap.
[03:27:05.721 --> 03:27:10.105]  Of course you're not commercially viable when they censor all the revenue.
[03:27:10.105 --> 03:27:10.906]  And then they cut you off.
[03:27:10.906 --> 03:27:12.167]  And they say, well, see, we had to cut you off.
[03:27:12.167 --> 03:27:13.868]  You weren't earning us any money.
[03:27:13.868 --> 03:27:14.929]  Really?
[03:27:14.929 --> 03:27:18.232]  I'm not going to cut you off.
[03:27:18.232 --> 03:27:21.395]  Now, we don't pay people for posting videos.
[03:27:21.395 --> 03:27:23.236]  We're lucky to be breakeven.
[03:27:23.236 --> 03:27:24.417]  But we're not going to cut you off.
[03:27:24.417 --> 03:27:26.219]  Your speech is more important.
[03:27:26.781 --> 03:27:29.022]  Than making a few pennies on some gun video.
[03:27:29.022 --> 03:27:31.243]  Speech is what's going to save this nation.
[03:27:31.243 --> 03:27:37.425]  And I really feel a sense of inspiration today that things are beginning to turn against the deep state.
[03:27:37.425 --> 03:27:38.826]  The deep state's being exposed.
[03:27:38.826 --> 03:27:48.470]  As more people have read this IG Horowitz report, which initially looked like a total whitewash, and in some respects it was, they said the FBI wasn't biased.
[03:27:48.470 --> 03:27:49.690]  Really?
[03:27:49.690 --> 03:27:50.231]  Give me a break!
[03:27:50.231 --> 03:27:51.251]  Come on!
[03:27:51.251 --> 03:27:53.452]  But as people are going through it over the last day or so,
[03:27:54.457 --> 03:27:59.058]  They're finding amazing revelations in that report.
[03:27:59.058 --> 03:28:02.259]  Revelations that are damning to the deep state and to the FBI.
[03:28:02.259 --> 03:28:04.560]  I mean, Breitbart today, I got a story right here.
[03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:10.521]  Breitbart has a story, what, ten disturbing findings in the Justice Department Inspector General Report.
[03:28:10.521 --> 03:28:23.725]  And almost every one of these ten findings talks about how the FBI, under James Comey and Barack Obama, the FBI was, and in some ways still is, a corrupt criminal cartel, a lawless
[03:28:24.588 --> 03:28:28.052]  Organization that is destroying America from within.
[03:28:28.052 --> 03:28:31.575]  That's the FBI today and I believe Christopher Wray is still part of that.
[03:28:31.575 --> 03:28:33.837]  And yes, Christopher Wray should be fired.
[03:28:33.837 --> 03:28:37.441]  But the truth is beginning to come out because of people like you.
[03:28:37.441 --> 03:28:41.525]  Because of your support and your willingness to tell the truth and share the truth.
[03:28:41.525 --> 03:28:43.687]  I'm just going to help you do that with more and more tools.
[03:28:43.687 --> 03:28:44.928]  Much more analysis straight ahead.
[03:28:44.928 --> 03:28:45.469]  Stay with us.
[03:28:45.469 --> 03:28:46.410]  We'll be back after this break.
[03:28:52.077 --> 03:28:55.099]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:28:55.099 --> 03:28:58.001]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[03:28:58.001 --> 03:29:05.226]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[03:29:05.226 --> 03:29:10.470]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.
[03:29:10.470 --> 03:29:18.055]  FlashRouters uses a virtual private network, or VPN, to protect your online activity from hackers, trackers, and large corporations.
[03:29:18.055 --> 03:29:21.558]  And not just one, but all your devices with one out-of-the-box setup.
[03:29:21.818 --> 03:29:30.985]  Plus, FlashRouters also enhances your wireless network performance and unlocks powerful router management tools to let you take total control of your network.
[03:29:30.985 --> 03:29:34.168]  Call or click FlashRouters today at 1-866-509-5817 or F-L-A-S-H-R-O-U-T-E-R-S dot com.
[03:29:34.168 --> 03:29:35.369]  That's 1-866-509-5817 or FlashRouters dot com.
[03:29:35.369 --> 03:29:40.273]  Protect your wireless home network today with FlashRouters.
[03:29:52.918 --> 03:29:56.139]  If it isn't broken, then you can't fix it.
[03:29:56.139 --> 03:30:13.545]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[03:30:13.545 --> 03:30:14.866]  We're being taken off the land.
[03:30:15.746 --> 03:30:26.391]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[03:30:26.391 --> 03:30:35.535]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[03:30:36.275 --> 03:30:39.636]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[03:30:39.636 --> 03:30:44.118]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[03:30:44.118 --> 03:30:45.978]  This is the post-human error.
[03:30:45.978 --> 03:30:48.739]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[03:30:48.739 --> 03:30:50.200]  This is the crossroads.
[03:30:50.200 --> 03:30:52.761]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[03:30:52.761 --> 03:30:56.242]  Sometimes the right thing to do is the easy thing to do.
[03:30:56.242 --> 03:30:58.203]  It's the healthy thing to do.
[03:30:58.203 --> 03:31:00.904]  It's the thing that makes all of our lives better.
[03:31:01.684 --> 03:31:04.508]  And that's taking care of our individual health.
[03:31:04.508 --> 03:31:20.307]  And it's never been easier to do the right thing this Christmas season than to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get the highest quality supplements that are life-changing in what they will do for you and your family's body, your outlook on life, your focus, your health.

[03:31:26.592 --> 03:31:31.855]  Where else can you spend your hard-earned money knowing that it's a true 360 win?
[03:31:31.855 --> 03:31:39.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, don't spend your money with the big box stores and the big globalist online merchants who literally are working against you and your family's future.
[03:31:40.300 --> 03:31:48.052]  Spend your money on high quality products and have huge savings and don't fight the big crowds and the traffic at InfowarStore.com.

[03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:57.950]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:11.812 --> 03:33:15.094]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:33:15.094 --> 03:33:22.638]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:33:22.638 --> 03:33:30.742]  Segment here for all Virginians who are proving to be incredibly courageous, incredibly patriotic individuals.
[03:33:30.742 --> 03:33:36.225]  Some of the, I mean, it's like, you know how the people of Hong Kong are rising up against the tyranny of mainland China?
[03:33:36.846 --> 03:33:47.115]  Well, the people of Virginia are rising up against tyranny of their own state government, Governor Northam there and the Democrat-controlled legislature and judiciary system and executive branch of government.
[03:33:47.115 --> 03:33:48.155]  This is a very important segment.
[03:33:48.155 --> 03:33:50.337]  I'm going to go into great detail about this.
[03:33:50.337 --> 03:33:58.244]  I'm going to ask you to share this video segment with anyone you know who lives in Virginia or near Virginia or who has a family member in Virginia.
[03:33:59.179 --> 03:34:02.921]  You know, it's one of the founding states of our nation.
[03:34:02.921 --> 03:34:05.282]  It's been in existence for 243 years.
[03:34:05.282 --> 03:34:09.604]  The state slogan, loosely translated, means death to tyrants.
[03:34:09.604 --> 03:34:13.626]  Not exactly, but I think, what is it?
[03:34:13.626 --> 03:34:17.648]  Six Semper Tyrannis, I think, is the Latin of that slogan.
[03:34:17.648 --> 03:34:25.952]  But Virginia is now under attack from these globalists, these baby killers, baby butchering Governor Northam,
[03:34:26.641 --> 03:34:35.504]  Who said that it's okay, in his view, to have a baby born alive, healthy, breathing, alive, separate from the mother.
[03:34:35.504 --> 03:34:42.626]  And then he said, well, we got to keep that baby comfortable until the mother decides to have it butchered and killed.
[03:34:42.626 --> 03:34:44.947]  I mean, I added the last part, but that's what he means.
[03:34:44.947 --> 03:34:47.947]  To keep it comfortable until the mother decides what to do with it.
[03:34:47.947 --> 03:34:50.288]  And he means to kill it.
[03:34:50.288 --> 03:34:52.929]  Governor Northam, he's a demon.
[03:34:52.929 --> 03:34:54.629]  He's an anti-human demon.
[03:34:54.629 --> 03:34:56.350]  He's a scourge on humanity.
[03:34:56.952 --> 03:34:57.972]  I'm not going to hold back on this.
[03:34:57.972 --> 03:34:59.853]  I'll just tell you what it is, okay?
[03:34:59.853 --> 03:35:03.375]  Governor Northam and the Democrats of Virginia are traitors.
[03:35:03.375 --> 03:35:10.578]  They are treasonous, anti-American, tyrannical, authoritarian, scum of humanity.
[03:35:10.578 --> 03:35:15.560]  They are baby butchers, killers, mass murderers, and serial murder advocates.
[03:35:15.560 --> 03:35:17.441]  And they're coming for your guns.
[03:35:17.441 --> 03:35:22.903]  And what Governor Northam just announced yesterday is that he wants to build a gun registration list.
[03:35:23.809 --> 03:35:38.241]  Why would they want to register the home addresses of all the people who own guns in Virginia, even as 40-plus counties in Virginia have now declared themselves to be Second Amendment sanctuary counties?
[03:35:38.241 --> 03:35:44.226]  And there are over 80 towns and cities and counties in total that have declared themselves to be Second Amendment sanctuaries.
[03:35:44.226 --> 03:35:45.607]  Why?
[03:35:45.607 --> 03:35:48.850]  Why does this baby killer, Northam, want to know where you live?
[03:35:50.345 --> 03:35:50.665]  Answer?
[03:35:50.665 --> 03:35:53.628]  He's not building a gun registration list.
[03:35:53.628 --> 03:35:56.010]  He's building a murder list.
[03:35:56.010 --> 03:35:57.972]  He's building a genocide list.
[03:35:57.972 --> 03:36:00.634]  He's building a list of who to go kill.
[03:36:00.634 --> 03:36:03.376]  Because that's what Democrats always do.
[03:36:03.376 --> 03:36:06.879]  This is what radical leftists always do throughout human history.
[03:36:06.879 --> 03:36:10.302]  And in a story I've just posted, it's up on Infowars.com right now.
[03:36:10.302 --> 03:36:13.085]  You look at human history just in the 20th century alone.
[03:36:13.979 --> 03:36:23.968]  These gun control regimes, these radical leftists, fascists and communists, they murdered over a quarter of a billion human beings.
[03:36:23.968 --> 03:36:32.977]  262 million living, breathing human beings have been exterminated by the same kind of people who share the mindset of Governor Northam.
[03:36:34.031 --> 03:36:46.976]  He is, in fact, operating with the mindset of Pol Pot and Stalin and Chairman Mao and all the mass murderers of human history who exterminated hundreds of millions of human beings.
[03:36:46.976 --> 03:36:51.058]  And Governor Northam says, it's okay to kill your baby.
[03:36:51.058 --> 03:36:55.080]  And if he thinks that that's okay, do you think he has any hesitation against killing you?
[03:36:55.080 --> 03:36:55.860]  No.
[03:36:55.860 --> 03:36:58.041]  But first, he needs to do two things.
[03:36:58.041 --> 03:37:00.682]  He needs to, number one, know where you live.
[03:37:00.682 --> 03:37:02.923]  And number two, he needs to disarm you.
[03:37:04.264 --> 03:37:07.445]  So, they start with a gun registration list.
[03:37:07.445 --> 03:37:14.246]  And they say, well, you can keep your AR-15 for a while, until they come for it.
[03:37:14.246 --> 03:37:23.328]  You can keep your AR-15 that you purchased legally and lawfully, as long as you register with Richmond.
[03:37:23.328 --> 03:37:29.689]  As long as you let the government run by tyrannical Democrats know where you live and how many guns you have.
[03:37:30.569 --> 03:37:41.774]  And by the way, if there was ever an argument to go out and buy a ghost gunner and start using the router on the AR-15 lowers and building your own rifles, this is the argument right here.
[03:37:41.774 --> 03:37:48.077]  You need to have rifles that you build yourself, and it's legal to do so, I believe, currently, in Virginia.
[03:37:48.077 --> 03:37:49.878]  It's legal to do so.
[03:37:49.878 --> 03:37:56.001]  You need to make your own rifles, because they are coming for your guns, and when they take those guns, they're going to use them against you.
[03:37:56.001 --> 03:37:58.602]  This is what history has shown again and again.
[03:37:58.602 --> 03:37:59.623]  First, they take your guns.
[03:38:00.736 --> 03:38:04.099]  Look, what's the reason for taking your guns?
[03:38:04.099 --> 03:38:06.121]  Again, I'll just say it uncensored here.
[03:38:06.121 --> 03:38:18.492]  It's because Governor Northam and the Democrats of Virginia, who are treasonous, evil, anti-American traitors, they plan to do something that the citizens might shoot them for attempting to do.
[03:38:19.818 --> 03:38:23.120]  They plan to commit atrocities against you.
[03:38:23.120 --> 03:38:24.181]  This is their plan.
[03:38:24.181 --> 03:38:32.767]  Remember, Democrats today, they have already announced that they want to mass murder people who wear MAGA hats or President Trump himself.
[03:38:32.767 --> 03:38:38.651]  They've said through their censorship that you don't have the right to speak on Google or Twitter or Facebook.
[03:38:38.651 --> 03:38:43.174]  And they've said you don't have the right to have a job because they've kicked you out of your careers if you support Trump.
[03:38:43.174 --> 03:38:45.856]  They've said you don't have the right to exist.
[03:38:45.856 --> 03:38:49.419]  And now Governor Northam comes along and says you don't have the right to defend yourself.
[03:38:50.456 --> 03:38:55.077]  Against the Democrats who want to have you destroyed and exterminated.
[03:38:55.077 --> 03:38:58.018]  To the people of Virginia, look, I'm a Texan.
[03:38:58.018 --> 03:39:06.381]  I'm a Texan, and I have much the same mindset as you can tell, but to the people of Virginia, I offer a warning to you today, maybe an awakening.
[03:39:06.381 --> 03:39:10.822]  If you don't stop this tyranny, they will come to kill you.
[03:39:10.822 --> 03:39:17.604]  They will first disarm you, will first register you, and then disarm you, and then they will murder you.
[03:39:18.829 --> 03:39:38.436]  And I know many of you already know this, and if you let them do that, you will be dead in a ditch dug by Democrat-run bulldozers, because this is the genocidal mania and the lunacy and the violence that Democrats... It just saturates their very being.
[03:39:38.436 --> 03:39:40.517]  This is who they are.
[03:39:40.517 --> 03:39:45.019]  If they weren't advocates of violence, how could they kill their own living, breathing babies?
[03:39:46.457 --> 03:39:53.180]  They are seething with violence and seething with hatred for you, the citizens of Virginia.
[03:39:53.180 --> 03:40:06.627]  The good men and women of this nation, of the state of Virginia, whose ancestors helped create the original founding of the United States of America, the original revolutionary war of independence for this nation.
[03:40:06.627 --> 03:40:11.450]  All of that is being put at stake by these radical, lawless Democrats.
[03:40:11.450 --> 03:40:11.950]  And guess what?
[03:40:12.833 --> 03:40:24.398]  There are now state Democrats in Virginia, lawmakers, who are saying that if you declare your county to be a sanctuary, Second Amendment sanctuary, that you are a domestic terrorist.
[03:40:24.398 --> 03:40:25.658]  You see how that logic works?
[03:40:25.658 --> 03:40:29.800]  Oh, and they say you're racist somehow, even though race has nothing to do with this.
[03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:36.063]  Because every black man and woman in Virginia should also be armed in his or her own defense as well.
[03:40:37.136 --> 03:40:39.817]  This isn't about white people or Latino people.
[03:40:39.817 --> 03:40:42.458]  Every honest citizen of Virginia should be armed.
[03:40:42.458 --> 03:40:49.160]  And every honest citizen of Virginia should be outraged against what this treasonous Governor Northam is attempting to carry out.
[03:40:49.160 --> 03:40:50.781]  And every citizen of Virginia
[03:40:51.440 --> 03:40:59.808]  Should be aware of what's going to happen if you try to appease these tyrants and say, okay, we'll just register our guns.
[03:40:59.808 --> 03:41:06.435]  We'll just let them know the serial numbers of our AR-15s and how many we have and where we live.
[03:41:06.435 --> 03:41:08.657]  Yeah, and then they'll go away.
[03:41:08.657 --> 03:41:09.217]  Really?
[03:41:09.217 --> 03:41:10.479]  You think so?
[03:41:10.479 --> 03:41:11.380]  Don't be a fool.
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:13.362]  They are never going to go away.
[03:41:13.362 --> 03:41:18.748]  They're going to come to take your guns a year later after another mass shooting that they carry out.
[03:41:18.748 --> 03:41:20.350]  They will plan the mass shootings.
[03:41:20.350 --> 03:41:22.011]  They will run the mass shootings.
[03:41:22.011 --> 03:41:22.812]  And then they will blame you!
[03:41:24.016 --> 03:41:25.377]  You who complied!
[03:41:25.377 --> 03:41:27.658]  You who are a law-abiding citizen!
[03:41:27.658 --> 03:41:28.819]  You who did nothing wrong!
[03:41:28.819 --> 03:41:30.540]  You never shot anybody!
[03:41:30.540 --> 03:41:32.461]  And you have no intention of doing so!
[03:41:32.461 --> 03:41:51.273]  You are a law-abiding citizen of Virginia, and yet you are being punished by the tyrants, whose real motivation inside their dark, twisted hearts and putrid minds, their motivation is to take your life from you, throw you in a ditch, to get rid of their political opponents, just like these same radical leftists have done throughout human history.
[03:41:51.273 --> 03:41:51.913]  That's the truth.
[03:41:52.631 --> 03:41:55.793]  And that's why I beg you, share this video segment.
[03:41:55.793 --> 03:41:57.454]  It's on Banned.Video.
[03:41:57.454 --> 03:41:59.996]  It'll be posted on Brighteon.com.
[03:41:59.996 --> 03:42:11.163]  You won't find it on YouTube, obviously, because they don't want you to know the truth, and they don't want you to realize that sooner or later, the people of Virginia are going to have to stop the tyrants.
[03:42:11.163 --> 03:42:18.028]  They're going to have to band together and defend and restore the civil rights of all Virginians.
[03:42:18.863 --> 03:42:23.424]  In fact, the Second Amendment was written for precisely this context.
[03:42:23.424 --> 03:42:37.148]  This is what your duty is to defend the rights and the lives and the safety of the citizens of Virginia against the tyrants who are also letting violent, criminal, illegal aliens flood your state because of open borders policies.
[03:42:37.148 --> 03:42:45.650]  You have the right to defend yourself and you have the obligation to stop tyrants who are trying to overthrow your liberty and your sovereignty.
[03:42:45.650 --> 03:42:46.370]  Much more straight ahead.
[03:42:46.370 --> 03:42:47.991]  We'll be back after this break.
[03:42:51.806 --> 03:42:59.632]  The 12 Days of Christmas Super Sale has come to Info Wars, with free shipping storewide and double Patriot Points.

[03:43:55.257 --> 03:44:12.653]  That's why the technocracy is openly breaking the human code, genetically mutating us, poisoning us, lowering our IQs, lowering our life expectancy, and then destroying the institutions and cultural systems developed by our ancient mammal species of the family.
[03:44:12.653 --> 03:44:14.014]  We're being taken off the land.
[03:44:14.855 --> 03:44:25.501]  We're being taken beyond domestication to the next level of slavery until we cannot even procreate anymore and are no longer human.
[03:44:25.501 --> 03:44:34.647]  Then the corporate masters who wish more than anything to play God believe they can come rescue humanity with their new systems that we will willingly
[03:44:35.387 --> 03:44:38.751]  Beg for them to implement against us.
[03:44:38.751 --> 03:44:43.235]  This is the forced seduction of the Luciferian world government model.
[03:44:43.235 --> 03:44:45.097]  This is the post-human error.
[03:44:45.097 --> 03:44:47.860]  This is the ultimate tyranny visited upon the planet.
[03:44:47.860 --> 03:44:49.322]  This is the crossroads.
[03:44:49.322 --> 03:44:51.143]  Resist or be destroyed for eternity.
[03:44:53.240 --> 03:44:54.080]  Andy in Florida.
[03:44:54.080 --> 03:44:54.661]  Thank you, Andy.
[03:44:54.661 --> 03:44:55.101]  Go ahead.
[03:44:55.101 --> 03:44:56.401]  Hey, Alex.
[03:44:56.401 --> 03:44:57.162]  I love you, man.
[03:44:57.162 --> 03:44:57.782]  We love you.
[03:44:57.782 --> 03:45:01.764]  Before I go ahead and talk about the topic at hand, I gotta talk about one of your products.
[03:45:01.764 --> 03:45:03.325]  A little bit about me.
[03:45:03.325 --> 03:45:03.925]  I'm 245 pounds.
[03:45:03.925 --> 03:45:06.926]  I work about 10 to 13 hours a day at UPS.
[03:45:06.926 --> 03:45:10.228]  And to make a long story short, I used to have a problem with Adderall.
[03:45:10.228 --> 03:45:14.730]  I do have ADHD, but I was taking Adderall for its energy-boosting properties.
[03:45:15.230 --> 03:45:15.470]  I think so.
[03:45:30.589 --> 03:45:33.170]  We're really proud of TurboForce, so thank you, sir.
[03:45:33.170 --> 03:45:35.831]  Commit to buy a lot of your products at Inforestore.com, then help us spread the word.
[03:45:52.919 --> 03:45:55.320]  It's time to take yourself to the next level.
[03:45:55.320 --> 03:45:59.823]  It doesn't matter if you're a man, it doesn't matter if you're a woman, it doesn't matter if you're old or young.
[03:45:59.823 --> 03:46:04.686]  As you age, preglanone levels in the body go down.
[03:46:04.686 --> 03:46:17.375]  Now in 60 seconds, I don't have time to tell you what preglanone does, but look into the fact that they've been prescribing it since the 1920s for people that have arthritis, and then it just gets wilder from there.
[03:46:18.095 --> 03:46:23.562]  Medical science knows all about this, but they suppress information about Preglanone.
[03:46:23.562 --> 03:46:30.490]  We've got the best form of Preglanone with a bunch of high-quality vitamins and minerals in Real Red Pill.
[03:46:30.490 --> 03:46:33.494]  Real Red Pill Plus has some added energy as well.
[03:46:33.494 --> 03:46:34.435]  Now you can get it for 65% off
[03:46:35.436 --> 03:46:37.137]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:06.776 --> 03:47:13.842]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Mike Adams.
[03:47:13.842 --> 03:47:19.287]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.287 --> 03:47:23.010]  When the Democrats come for you in Virginia, they won't say they're murdering you.
[03:47:23.010 --> 03:47:24.451]  They will say they're aborting you.
[03:47:25.464 --> 03:47:27.025]  Because that's what they do when they murder children.
[03:47:27.025 --> 03:47:28.285]  They say, ah, it's just abortion.
[03:47:28.285 --> 03:47:29.466]  It's post-birth abortion.
[03:47:29.466 --> 03:47:32.608]  And you notice they don't have any age limits on that, by the way.
[03:47:32.608 --> 03:47:37.050]  They don't say, oh, you can only abort a baby that's four hours old or four weeks old.
[03:47:37.050 --> 03:47:38.090]  They have no age limits.
[03:47:38.090 --> 03:47:49.736]  So, look, when they take your guns and they come for you and actually use your guns to put a bullet in your head, they will say that they are just aborting people who are domestic terrorists.
[03:47:49.736 --> 03:47:50.337]  That's what they'll say.
[03:47:50.337 --> 03:47:51.057]  I mean, look,
[03:47:51.610 --> 03:47:57.874]  These people are so sick and so twisted, these Democrats, they can justify anything by twisting language around.
[03:47:57.874 --> 03:48:04.958]  I mean, look, they justify the chemical mutilation of children by calling it progressivism and tolerance and transgenderism.
[03:48:04.958 --> 03:48:05.838]  Really?
[03:48:05.838 --> 03:48:07.879]  No, you're just poisoning that child!
[03:48:07.879 --> 03:48:08.580]  You're just, you're just...
[03:48:09.355 --> 03:48:13.698]  Cutting apart their reproductive organs in some weird, twisted surgical procedure.
[03:48:13.698 --> 03:48:16.840]  I mean, you're collecting baby parts in your abortion centers.
[03:48:16.840 --> 03:48:18.601]  You are sick, twisted people.
[03:48:18.601 --> 03:48:20.883]  The Silence of the Lambs has become a political party.
[03:48:20.883 --> 03:48:22.524]  It's called Democrats.
[03:48:22.524 --> 03:48:23.224]  I mean, it's sick.
[03:48:23.224 --> 03:48:26.606]  These people are sick, twisted, mentally ill demons and criminals.
[03:48:26.606 --> 03:48:29.768]  Alright, I'm going to blow through some news here.
[03:48:29.768 --> 03:48:31.650]  Some other news that you need to hear.
[03:48:31.650 --> 03:48:33.771]  Some very important things that hit my radar today.
[03:48:35.316 --> 03:48:36.477]  Crypto.
[03:48:36.477 --> 03:48:51.468]  The FBI has made an arrest, and the DOJ has charged currently three individuals for what they call a cryptocurrency scheme, which was a Bitcoin mining pool that they say bilked investors out of $722 million.
[03:48:51.468 --> 03:48:54.210]  And, of course, these three people were arrested.
[03:48:54.210 --> 03:48:56.752]  They're facing about 25 years in prison now.
[03:48:58.439 --> 03:48:59.220]  Okay, whatever.
[03:48:59.220 --> 03:49:01.743]  I want to point out something really interesting here.
[03:49:01.743 --> 03:49:05.387]  The FBI itself is a criminal cartel.
[03:49:05.387 --> 03:49:10.473]  And, secondly, the far bigger scam is the Federal Reserve.
[03:49:10.473 --> 03:49:10.934]  The U.S.
[03:49:10.934 --> 03:49:18.523]  dollar has lost 98% of its value since 1913, you know, creature from Jekyll Island when the Fed was created.
[03:49:19.224 --> 03:49:20.345]  Is that not theft?
[03:49:20.345 --> 03:49:22.547]  Is that not a massive Ponzi scheme?
[03:49:22.547 --> 03:49:30.132]  And by the way, you are required to participate in that dollar-denominated Ponzi scheme.
[03:49:30.132 --> 03:49:35.957]  The government takes money out of your pockets, essentially at gunpoint, through confiscatory taxes.
[03:49:35.957 --> 03:49:46.544]  Now this crypto scheme that the FBI says they busted, I don't remember anybody from that company coming to my house and putting a gun to my head and saying, you have to invest in our crypto scheme.
[03:49:46.544 --> 03:49:47.065]  No!
[03:49:47.065 --> 03:49:48.366]  People did it by consent.
[03:49:49.443 --> 03:49:51.625]  And if you lost money with that, you lost money.
[03:49:51.625 --> 03:49:52.485]  You're probably new.
[03:49:52.485 --> 03:49:54.367]  You're playing a high-risk game.
[03:49:54.367 --> 03:49:56.008]  You lost money.
[03:49:56.008 --> 03:50:05.455]  But the Fed, the Federal Reserve, the fiat currency system, the fake money supply, they put a gun to your head and make you participate in their scam.
[03:50:05.455 --> 03:50:10.679]  So in my opinion, that's far more evil than anything in cryptocurrency.
[03:50:10.679 --> 03:50:14.722]  I'm not defending whatever this crypto company did, this mining pool.
[03:50:14.722 --> 03:50:16.243]  Maybe they did lie to investors.
[03:50:16.243 --> 03:50:18.385]  Probably they did if the DOJ is to be believed.
[03:50:18.385 --> 03:50:18.685]  I don't know.
[03:50:19.346 --> 03:50:21.827]  I'm just saying the Fed lies to us every day.
[03:50:21.827 --> 03:50:28.010]  And the Fed steals money from your pocket every hour while you're sleeping because they're debasing the money supply.
[03:50:28.010 --> 03:50:31.031]  And yet, the FBI isn't investigating the Fed.
[03:50:31.031 --> 03:50:31.592]  Right?
[03:50:31.592 --> 03:50:37.074]  No one goes to jail for counterfeiting currency when you do it at a national level.
[03:50:37.074 --> 03:50:38.075]  Hyperinflation.
[03:50:38.075 --> 03:50:39.395]  You know, look at Venezuela.
[03:50:39.395 --> 03:50:40.836]  Hey, the crooks are in charge!
[03:50:40.836 --> 03:50:42.817]  Same thing's true in Washington, D.C.
[03:50:42.817 --> 03:50:45.038]  Oh, by the way, this reminds me.
[03:50:45.038 --> 03:50:47.559]  Some other... This is... This is real important.
[03:50:48.237 --> 03:50:57.141]  Why the Senate may let, they may eradicate this impeachment charge right away after the House votes for impeachment.
[03:50:57.141 --> 03:50:59.382]  The Senate doesn't want a trial.
[03:50:59.382 --> 03:51:01.043]  And you know why?
[03:51:01.043 --> 03:51:08.567]  Because the Rhino Republicans are on the take and being bribed and getting kickbacks just like the Democrat Senators.
[03:51:08.567 --> 03:51:15.730]  And the way this works is that every piece of foreign aid that pumps billions of dollars into some foreign country like Ukraine
[03:51:16.405 --> 03:51:25.333]  The people in power in America, whether it's Presidents or Vice Presidents under Obama, Trump isn't doing this, but the others did, or Senators, they all skim off that.
[03:51:25.333 --> 03:51:27.154]  They get kickbacks.
[03:51:27.154 --> 03:51:28.155]  Yes, they get kickbacks.
[03:51:28.155 --> 03:51:36.222]  And it's Republican Senators, and it's Democrat Senators, and it's people who head departments and committees, and it's Vice Presidents and so on.
[03:51:36.222 --> 03:51:37.443]  State Department people.
[03:51:37.443 --> 03:51:38.404]  They're all on the take.
[03:51:39.145 --> 03:51:43.227]  Why do you think we have so much, quote, foreign aid going out the door?
[03:51:43.227 --> 03:51:53.591]  Because it's coming back in the form of kickbacks to the very lawmakers that are sitting in the Senate chambers right now, pretending to be upstanding, honest citizens.
[03:51:53.591 --> 03:51:55.392]  Most of those people are crooks.
[03:51:55.392 --> 03:51:57.112]  Now, not Senator Rand Paul.
[03:51:57.112 --> 03:51:57.973]  He is not a crook.
[03:51:57.973 --> 03:51:58.993]  He's a good guy.
[03:51:58.993 --> 03:52:03.975]  And there are good men and women scattered throughout Washington, D.C., but there's not a lot of them.
[03:52:04.475 --> 03:52:05.415]  Most of them are crooks.
[03:52:05.415 --> 03:52:06.776]  Most of them are on the take.
[03:52:06.776 --> 03:52:09.456]  And that's why they don't want investigations into this.
[03:52:09.456 --> 03:52:18.279]  Because if we call Joe Biden as a witness, and we call people related to Burisma as witnesses, why do you think their visas were denied so they couldn't come to the U.S.
[03:52:18.279 --> 03:52:19.539]  and testify?
[03:52:19.539 --> 03:52:26.241]  The deep state is trying to protect this massive racket where your taxpayer dollars go into their pockets.
[03:52:26.997 --> 03:52:30.539]  After being skimmed off of international aid.
[03:52:30.539 --> 03:52:32.159]  That's what this has always been about.
[03:52:32.159 --> 03:52:34.540]  And Trump doesn't need the money.
[03:52:34.540 --> 03:52:37.222]  And Trump is sickened by this corruption.
[03:52:37.222 --> 03:52:39.062]  And Trump is trying to put an end to it.
[03:52:39.062 --> 03:52:40.823]  And that's why they're trying to destroy Trump.
[03:52:40.823 --> 03:52:48.047]  And by the way, I should remind you, this is why I think he may very well be impeached in the Senate.
[03:52:48.047 --> 03:52:51.888]  Don't think that the Senate is going to vote against impeachment.
[03:52:51.888 --> 03:52:53.389]  I'm not convinced of that at all.
[03:52:54.079 --> 03:52:55.900]  For this very reason that I just mentioned.
[03:52:55.900 --> 03:52:58.901]  Because there are Republican senators who are on the take.
[03:52:58.901 --> 03:53:00.901]  And they will betray Trump.
[03:53:00.901 --> 03:53:03.002]  And they will vote to convict.
[03:53:03.002 --> 03:53:04.823]  And they will kick him out of office.
[03:53:04.823 --> 03:53:06.623]  So I ask you this question.
[03:53:06.623 --> 03:53:10.665]  Because I think that will be the spark that sets off civil war across America.
[03:53:10.665 --> 03:53:13.206]  It's just my guess as an analyst.
[03:53:13.206 --> 03:53:17.367]  I think that's the last straw for millions of people.
[03:53:17.367 --> 03:53:19.048]  What do you think will happen?
[03:53:19.048 --> 03:53:22.169]  And what are you thinking that you need to do
[03:53:23.149 --> 03:53:26.811]  If Trump is removed by a corrupt Senate.
[03:53:26.811 --> 03:53:29.273]  Because that means we've lost the whole system.
[03:53:29.273 --> 03:53:30.513]  Everything is corrupt.
[03:53:30.513 --> 03:53:43.081]  The Deep State is endlessly, infinitely corrupt, and they cannot be stopped because the Senate has been corrupted, and the House has been corrupted, and even elements of the Supreme Court have been corrupted, like Justice Roberts, for example.
[03:53:43.081 --> 03:53:44.622]  How do you even take that back?
[03:53:44.622 --> 03:53:46.203]  We voted for Trump!
[03:53:46.203 --> 03:53:48.264]  And all they did was plot to remove him.
[03:53:49.031 --> 03:53:53.056]  From day one, even before he was inaugurated, they plotted to remove him.
[03:53:53.056 --> 03:53:57.261]  So what they're telling you is that your vote doesn't matter anymore.
[03:53:57.261 --> 03:54:06.612]  They're telling you that they, the deep state traitors and the Democrats, that they have abandoned the rule of law, that they will no longer abide by any pillar of civil society.
[03:54:07.296 --> 03:54:09.037]  They will not recognize facts.
[03:54:09.037 --> 03:54:11.258]  They will not recognize due process.
[03:54:11.258 --> 03:54:15.520]  They will not give Trump a fair hearing in court.
[03:54:15.520 --> 03:54:17.841]  You cannot cross-examine their witnesses.
[03:54:17.841 --> 03:54:19.702]  You can't even call your own witnesses.
[03:54:19.702 --> 03:54:25.965]  And then the Democrats, they have their witnesses come in, who magically become counsel, who are interrogating other witnesses.
[03:54:25.965 --> 03:54:26.165]  What?
[03:54:27.088 --> 03:54:29.990]  What kind of a court circus is this?
[03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.631]  It's a joke.
[03:54:30.631 --> 03:54:31.792]  It's a farce.
[03:54:31.792 --> 03:54:32.832]  It's all theater.
[03:54:32.832 --> 03:54:38.176]  But that's what the Democrats are doing, and the Republicans, the establishment people, are in with them.
[03:54:38.176 --> 03:54:41.379]  John McCain, he was part of this Trump dossier.
[03:54:41.379 --> 03:54:46.643]  He was part of the ferreting of this information over to the FBI to justify the FISA warrant.
[03:54:46.643 --> 03:54:50.706]  John McCain was a traitor to America.
[03:54:50.706 --> 03:54:51.906]  Yeah, quote me on that.
[03:54:51.906 --> 03:54:52.427]  Quote me on it.
[03:54:52.427 --> 03:54:53.147]  You can quote me.
[03:54:53.147 --> 03:54:54.729]  Get my name right.
[03:54:54.729 --> 03:54:56.450]  John McCain is a traitor to America.
[03:54:57.595 --> 03:55:00.056]  And there are others.
[03:55:00.056 --> 03:55:00.896]  Not just him.
[03:55:00.896 --> 03:55:01.677]  Many more.
[03:55:01.677 --> 03:55:04.277]  And they may very well vote to impeach President Trump.
[03:55:04.277 --> 03:55:06.098]  So, be on the lookout for that.
[03:55:06.098 --> 03:55:07.359]  Now, I gotta get to some other news.
[03:55:07.359 --> 03:55:08.439]  Okay, quickly.
[03:55:08.439 --> 03:55:10.940]  Home Depot is now warning.
[03:55:10.940 --> 03:55:11.960]  This is on Zero Hedge.
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:20.803]  Home Depot is warning that the opioid crisis is creating addicts who are carrying out all these mass shoplifting across Home Depot stores all across America.
[03:55:20.803 --> 03:55:25.585]  Like, all these meth heads and opioid addicts are just stealing from all these retailers all the time.
[03:55:26.244 --> 03:55:40.275]  New York Supreme Court rules that the Amish cannot say no to vaccines in their own schools, that all of their children have to be vaccinated now, even if it's against a religion, and even if vaccines contain aborted human fetal tissue.
[03:55:41.300 --> 03:55:42.361]  Portland, Oregon.

[03:56:42.216 --> 03:56:43.456]  And he said, yeah, I feel it.
