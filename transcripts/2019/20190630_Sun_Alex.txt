[00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.211]  It's Sunday, June 30th, 2019.
[00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:19.292]  We have put an incredible amount of work in today's broadcast.
[00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:26.033]  We taped a lot of it yesterday, we taped a lot of it today, so we can get every factoid, every piece of info in.
[00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:34.635]  Please, stay tuned today and get this live audio feed and video feeds out to people because the information we're gonna lay out is astounding.
[00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:38.176]  The whole world is waking up to globalism and just how evil it is.
[00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:46.505]  I'm about to play an excerpt of an incredibly powerful Tucker Carlson piece from Asia.
[00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:53.216]  Then Robert Barnes and myself lay out that the mainstream media admits that Joe Biden has neurological problems and this is just
[00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:56.780]  Earth-shattering to their entire operation.
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.321]  That's coming up.
[00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:02.384]  The Democrats have openly endorsed abortion as a spiritual sacrament.
[00:01:02.384 --> 00:01:03.344]  I'm not kidding.
[00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:04.525]  Wait till you hear this.
[00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:06.687]  Compilation of dozens of clips.
[00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:08.068]  So many special reports.
[00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.169]  A review of the insane debates.
[00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.370]  Trump and North Korea.
[00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.311]  What's really behind that.
[00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:13.331]  And this is historic.
[00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:14.392]  Crossing the DMC.
[00:01:14.392 --> 00:01:16.193]  Only sitting president to do it.
[00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:18.375]  And just so much more.
[00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:22.857]  This Sunday broadcast is beyond critical.
[00:01:22.857 --> 00:01:24.459]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:25.881]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:32.889]  The biggest thing you can do is, again, share this live link or tell folks about local stations you're listening to because history is happening.
[00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:35.332]  This is the 4th of July, coming up to remember.
[00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:42.367]  But back in our native land, the United States of America, the Democratic Party went completely insane yesterday.
[00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:44.287]  This has been happening for a while, of course.
[00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:46.148]  Insanity is a process.
[00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:52.289]  But last night, at the first Democratic primary debate of the 2020 season, they made it official.
[00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.710]  Elite Democrats have permanently broken with reality.
[00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.932]  They no longer care about what's true, what's possible, even what's real.
[00:01:59.932 --> 00:02:04.573]  They live in a kind of dream state, a place of fantasy punctuated by howls of self-righteousness.
[00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:11.059]  Watch as Julian Castro, and keep in mind, he was an actual cabinet secretary in the Obama administration.
[00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:12.760]  That was only a couple of years ago.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.908]  Watch as Julian Castro explains that men who get pregnant have a moral right to taxpayer-funded abortions.
[00:02:19.908 --> 00:02:20.388]  Not joking.
[00:02:20.388 --> 00:02:21.269]  Watch this.
[00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.472]  I don't believe only in reproductive freedom.
[00:02:24.472 --> 00:02:25.853]  I believe in reproductive justice.
[00:02:28.007 --> 00:02:43.841]  And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman, or let's also not forget, someone in the trans community, a trans female, is poor, doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose.
[00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:44.982]  And so they cheered.
[00:02:44.982 --> 00:02:48.144]  Behold, late empire liberalism in full flower.
[00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:51.327]  Who exactly is the constituency for Castro's idea?
[00:02:51.327 --> 00:02:53.108]  Men dressed as women who get pregnant.
[00:02:53.902 --> 00:02:55.544]  That's the constituency.
[00:02:55.544 --> 00:02:59.589]  Unfortunately, there are precisely zero people on planet Earth who fit that description.
[00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:01.271]  Not a single person, actually.
[00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:03.334]  There never have been any people like that.
[00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:05.636]  There never will be any people like that.
[00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:05.897]  Why?
[00:03:05.897 --> 00:03:07.679]  Because it's impossible.
[00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.601]  Biological men cannot get pregnant.
[00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.243]  Pretending otherwise is lunacy.
[00:03:12.243 --> 00:03:14.544]  It's the very definition of lunacy.
[00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:16.065]  But Julian Castro doesn't care.
[00:03:16.065 --> 00:03:21.267]  Taxpayer-funded transgender abortion sounds like something that all good progressives should support.
[00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:23.128]  So Castro fervently does.
[00:03:23.128 --> 00:03:29.051]  And critically, he knows that nobody in the room will defend science or pause to ask him, what the hell are you talking about?
[00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:30.952]  They can't say a word.
[00:03:30.952 --> 00:03:32.492]  They're too intimidated.
[00:03:32.492 --> 00:03:34.413]  They know HR is watching.
[00:03:34.413 --> 00:03:37.854]  So they nod like monkeys, as if everything he's saying is completely sane.
[00:03:37.854 --> 00:03:39.435]  Oh, good point, Mr. Secretary.
[00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:41.895]  Trans females shouldn't have to pay for their own abortions.
[00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:43.016]  That's racist.
[00:03:43.016 --> 00:03:45.777]  The whole thing was like a cartoon or an Evelyn Waugh novel.
[00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:48.118]  It went on like this all night.
[00:03:48.118 --> 00:03:54.741]  Here, for example, is Julian Castro agreeing with Elizabeth Warren that it shouldn't be illegal for foreigners to break our laws.
[00:03:54.741 --> 00:03:55.461]  Watch.
[00:03:55.461 --> 00:04:02.284]  When somebody comes across the border not to criminalize desperation, to treat that as a civil violation.
[00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:04.025]  Criminalized desperation.
[00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:08.468]  And you thought this was your country, just because, like your ancestors, you were born here.
[00:04:08.468 --> 00:04:13.452]  Just because you pay half your income to the government to keep the whole thing going, you thought it was your country.
[00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:15.153]  Think again, racist.
[00:04:15.153 --> 00:04:17.055]  America belongs to the rest of the world.
[00:04:17.055 --> 00:04:19.577]  Your job is to shut up and pay for it.
[00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:21.158]  Complain, and we'll punish you.
[00:04:21.158 --> 00:04:22.779]  Bill de Blasio often makes that point.
[00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:29.525]  Now de Blasio, the single worst mayor in the 400-year history of New York City, that's impressive.
[00:04:30.205 --> 00:04:32.827]  But how did he wind up on a presidential debate stage last night?
[00:04:32.827 --> 00:04:33.608]  God knows.
[00:04:33.608 --> 00:04:36.270]  Maybe he illegally immigrated there.
[00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.010]  Doesn't matter.
[00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.791]  He was there.
[00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:42.874]  And once he had the mic, de Blasio promised to seize your money and give it to his supporters.
[00:04:42.874 --> 00:04:45.216]  Who, he explained, deserve it much more than you do.
[00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:48.619]  Yes, we're supposed to be for a 70% tax rate on the wealthy.
[00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:50.020]  You hear folks say there's not enough money.
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.222]  What I say to them every single time is there's plenty of money in this world.
[00:04:53.222 --> 00:04:54.863]  There's plenty of money in this country.
[00:04:54.863 --> 00:04:57.045]  It's just in the wrong hands.
[00:04:57.045 --> 00:04:58.286]  Got it?
[00:04:58.286 --> 00:04:59.267]  We've got the power.
[00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:17.247]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[00:05:17.247 --> 00:05:18.969]  It is completely independent of all that.
[00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:25.614]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
[00:05:25.814 --> 00:05:26.635]  We're good to go.
[00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:50.138]  InfoWars.
[00:05:50.138 --> 00:05:51.059]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.259]  Today.
[00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:27.060]  I think it was a tougher night for the most seasoned candidates on the platform for Vice President Biden.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.521]  Why do you think it was?
[00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:33.645]  Because they seemed like part of the past rather than the future.
[00:06:33.645 --> 00:06:40.770]  At times the Vice President seemed somewhat confused to me in handling some of the questions and following some of the actions.
[00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.371]  He seemed a bit defensive.
[00:06:43.547 --> 00:06:44.948]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:06:44.948 --> 00:06:46.088]  I'm Robert Barnes.
[00:06:46.088 --> 00:06:52.331]  And we're about to break down one of the biggest stories of the 2020 election to come yet.
[00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:53.852]  And that's Joe Biden.
[00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:55.833]  Why can't he talk?
[00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:57.893]  Why is he slurring his words?
[00:06:57.893 --> 00:07:04.136]  Why is he clearly having moments where he freezes up like Angela Merkel of Germany is right now?
[00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:07.418]  And why as you talk about it, you get attacked by the mainstream media.
[00:07:08.078 --> 00:07:10.760]  But it turns out that we've been vindicated.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.101]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:16.204]  It was back in late April that he had his big campaign announcement speech.
[00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:22.228]  And during that speech, he sounded like he'd drunk either a bottle of whiskey or he'd had, quote, another stroke.
[00:07:22.228 --> 00:07:25.590]  That's because over a decade ago, he had a massive stroke.
[00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.291]  He almost died.
[00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:31.614]  Doctors said 50-50 chance he wouldn't even come back from it and that he'd be brain damaged.
[00:07:31.614 --> 00:07:35.117]  So I ask the question, has he had another stroke?
[00:07:35.117 --> 00:07:35.998]  I want to thank
[00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:44.313]  Uh, Rich Fitzgerald, the county executive, the Valgetti County Executive for being here, and all my time in public life since I've gotten involved.
[00:07:44.313 --> 00:07:51.016]  The country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, and hedge fund managers.
[00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:54.257]  If the enterprise hits hard times, everybody took a hit.
[00:07:54.257 --> 00:08:02.341]  Union workers, the UAW took incredible cuts in their future and their pensions in the left to get GM working.
[00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:04.062]  They also got that last year.
[00:08:04.742 --> 00:08:07.963]  And try to cut wages or freeze wages for their people.
[00:08:07.963 --> 00:08:11.625]  Right today, the same is happening in big hospital systems.
[00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:17.106]  I think we have to rethink how we define what constitutes a successful economy.
[00:08:17.106 --> 00:08:20.988]  Folks in America don't think their children are going to have the same standard of living they had.
[00:08:20.988 --> 00:08:23.529]  How can a person's dignity be maintained?
[00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:26.413]  Why they do that?
[00:08:26.413 --> 00:08:33.567]  It means investing much more in medical research to conquer devastating diseases like cancer and addiction and Alzheimer's.
[00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:35.270]  And the media said it was fake news.
[00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:44.005]  But now, months later, even Axelrod and CNN are saying, what's wrong with Joe Biden?
[00:08:44.005 --> 00:08:48.187]  You have David Axelrod on CNN saying, why does Joe seem so confused up there?
[00:08:48.187 --> 00:08:53.570]  Sean Trendy for RealClearPolitics commenting on Twitter that something seems to be wrong with Joe Biden.
[00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.592]  Van Jones questioning what is happening with Joe Biden.
[00:08:56.972 --> 00:08:57.192]  Why?
[00:08:57.192 --> 00:09:02.695]  Because he sat there and he struggled to get simply a sentence put together or sentences put together with each other.
[00:09:02.695 --> 00:09:11.200]  And in fact, his safe position seemed to be to keep saying, sorry, my time's up, whenever he ran out of words to say or couldn't remember what he was supposed to say.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.902]  He couldn't even bridge words or sentences together.
[00:09:13.902 --> 00:09:15.503]  That's how bad it was.
[00:09:15.503 --> 00:09:17.704]  Bob, for me, there's two big angles here.
[00:09:17.704 --> 00:09:18.665]  I want to get your take on them.
[00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:28.324]  Number one, why would the establishment run Joe Biden when clearly he's 76, he's had serious brain surgeries, and he's slowing down.
[00:09:28.324 --> 00:09:30.404]  He's got major cognitive problems.
[00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:36.406]  Are they using him as a placeholder that they can destroy kind of as the old Democratic Party and introduce the super woke?
[00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:39.107]  A 2020 party?
[00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:40.328]  Is that what's happening?
[00:09:40.328 --> 00:09:47.112]  And then, why would they say it's verboten for me to point out the obvious two or three months ago?
[00:09:47.112 --> 00:09:50.814]  Was that because it wasn't to be pointed out until later when they did it?
[00:09:50.814 --> 00:09:51.935]  Well, I think it's two parts.
[00:09:51.935 --> 00:10:00.500]  First is there's this desperation within the big money wing of the Democratic Party that looks at its candidates and sees a clown show that cannot compete with the President.
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.822]  And consequently, they needed Joe Biden because Biden looked the best in the polls.
[00:10:04.822 --> 00:10:07.343]  Biden had the most blue-collar appeal in their minds.
[00:10:07.343 --> 00:10:09.864]  So they were desperate to force him into the race.
[00:10:09.864 --> 00:10:16.327]  And it looked like he was dragged into the race, almost like he was a hostage running for office, not someone who wanted to run for office.
[00:10:16.327 --> 00:10:24.531]  So, you know, it's part one and part two as to how did they think they were going to get away with a person that has his age issues and health issues to actually be up there?
[00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:25.832]  It was so bad at the debates.
[00:10:26.152 --> 00:10:30.053]  That Biden was the only one who refused to do press interviews after the debate.
[00:10:30.053 --> 00:10:32.954]  Because they didn't want him interacting at all for even five seconds.
[00:10:32.954 --> 00:10:34.855]  That would further expose his problems.
[00:10:34.855 --> 00:10:35.155]  Why?
[00:10:35.155 --> 00:10:39.076]  Because they probably thought they could get away with it like they tried to get away with it with Hillary in 2016.
[00:10:39.076 --> 00:10:47.839]  That they could just drug her up, put her out there, do the John F. Kennedy debate prep routine, and they could do the same thing with Biden, and they didn't realize it wouldn't work.
[00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:49.840]  That his health is so bad it can't function.
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:58.704]  Why were they so upset back in April when I pointed out the Emperor's new clothes, the elephant in the room, and they even said on CNN, that's why he's been banned.
[00:10:58.704 --> 00:11:00.604]  He's trying to interfere with the election.
[00:11:00.604 --> 00:11:02.025]  I'm an American citizen.
[00:11:02.025 --> 00:11:05.727]  People questioned John McCain's health, and rightfully so.
[00:11:05.727 --> 00:11:08.908]  People questioned Ronald Reagan's health when he re-ran in 1984.
[00:11:08.908 --> 00:11:17.572]  Since when is it fake news or bad when somebody can obviously not even talk, look sleepy all the time, to question it?
[00:11:17.572 --> 00:11:18.472]  It's just crazy.
[00:11:18.652 --> 00:11:28.821]  The deeper and the greater the truth, the more they need to suppress it and censor it when it goes right to their core issues that exposes the falsity of their position or their candidate or their party.
[00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:37.268]  And because you're one of the lead people to expose it with Hillary Clinton, it led to the first wave of social media bans to expose their savior a second time.
[00:11:37.268 --> 00:11:42.012]  And Joe Biden was one step too far for Oliver Darcy and the CNNs and the Main Street Press.
[00:11:42.012 --> 00:11:44.253]  So what are they thinking now as the wheels come off?
[00:11:45.094 --> 00:11:50.519]  He's like Julius Caesar with the other 20 candidates stabbing him to death on the stage and in the media.
[00:11:50.519 --> 00:12:02.328]  Your prediction as the admitted top political gambler in the world, the most winning, right now, your prediction, the current way it's going, how do they get him to exit stage left?
[00:12:02.328 --> 00:12:07.393]  Or are they crazy enough like Hillary, having seizures, falling down, you name it, to just force him in there?
[00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:14.558]  Well, one can understand why Joe Biden opposes busing because right now he's in the bus that's going over the cliff and they're driving in that direction.
[00:12:14.558 --> 00:12:15.860]  That's where they're going to go.
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:22.485]  And I think that he either he's going to jump out of that bus before it goes over the cliff or he's going to go over it on his political gravestone.
[00:12:22.485 --> 00:12:24.887]  The words are going to be my time's up.
[00:12:24.887 --> 00:12:32.993]  Sorry to watch them eat their own and to watch them turn on Obama's buddy and imply he's the KKK really shows you that the left.
[00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:43.358]  Wants to dominate everybody with this SJW police state system, but no one else is listening to them, so they can only have power within their shrinking bubble.
[00:12:43.358 --> 00:12:46.219]  But they're getting more and more extreme as it unfolds.
[00:12:46.219 --> 00:12:49.080]  Bottom line, ladies and gentlemen, this is going to be one incredible 2020 race.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:55.025]  None of these candidates are doing well except the Congresswoman from Hawaii, so of course they're targeting her.
[00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:59.028]  We're going to be covering it all live tomorrow on the Sunday show 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:12:59.028 --> 00:13:06.015]  and throughout next week with myself, Owen Troyer, and of course David Knight at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:13:06.015 --> 00:13:11.220]  As we end this special Saturday transmission though, I want to play a few of the important reports from this week.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:11.660]  One where...
[00:13:12.361 --> 00:13:21.545]  Democrats literally worship abortion as their new religion, shocking the world, and several other key reports that are just so essential.
[00:13:21.545 --> 00:13:30.529]  Whatever you do at InfoWars.com, at NewsWars.com, take this live feed or take the feed after this and share this link with everyone.
[00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:38.753]  Because if you don't share it on your Instagram, your Facebook, your Twitter, your YouTube, if you don't share it on your email, your text message, or by word of mouth, the censors will win.
[00:13:39.153 --> 00:13:40.854]  Right now we're in a stalemate.
[00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:42.095]  That's why this fight is so critical.
[00:13:42.095 --> 00:13:47.760]  But that's my last question, because I heard you talking about it when you were co-hosting with Owen Friday.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.263]  What do you make of the open worship of abortion?
[00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:54.225]  Get that baby, kill that baby, show them.
[00:13:54.225 --> 00:13:59.269]  Not just the nasty comics, but mainline left saying that this is their new religion.
[00:13:59.269 --> 00:14:00.971]  Well, it fits within a broader context.
[00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:12.676]  In a broader construct of a lack of humanitarianism across the board, a lack of respect for the human being, a lack of respect for the individual, a lack of respect for the human conscience, the human soul, the human spirit.
[00:14:12.676 --> 00:14:26.361]  It sort of manifests itself in their love of AI and their love of big tech and their adoration of a sort of a global structure that devalues individual rights and individual interests and their lack of respect for free speech or free press of an independent kind or character.
[00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:30.462]  So it's just a broader, deeper, and the clearest and cleanest manifestation.
[00:14:30.462 --> 00:14:37.305]  When you're unwilling to protect the most vulnerable human life in the world, it shows you what your real values about human life are.
[00:14:37.305 --> 00:14:39.106]  And it shows they're not liberals.
[00:14:39.106 --> 00:14:40.106]  They're not humanitarians.
[00:14:40.106 --> 00:14:41.007]  They're bullies.
[00:14:41.007 --> 00:14:43.067]  They want to kill old people so we can save more money.
[00:14:43.067 --> 00:14:44.508]  They want to kill babies.
[00:14:44.508 --> 00:14:46.829]  It's this idea that if somebody's losing, they're winning.
[00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:47.689]  It's
[00:15:05.652 --> 00:15:09.034]  Where they're openly heating hospitals with dead baby parts, you name it.
[00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:11.075]  This is the horror of these people.
[00:15:11.075 --> 00:15:27.906]  And even though those of us that love justice and love God don't want to look at this and be aware of it, we have to stare at it, we have to know about it, and we have to share it and decry it so that people's hearts out there won't become hardened to it and will become soft to it and will care again.
[00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:29.426]  That's how we defend the unborn.
[00:15:29.426 --> 00:15:30.627]  Hell, now they're killing babies.
[00:15:30.627 --> 00:15:32.628]  After they're born, that's how we get this done.
[00:15:32.628 --> 00:15:33.469]  Robert Barnes, thank you.
[00:15:34.872 --> 00:15:40.638]  Well, coming up, excerpts from Wednesday and Thursday night, and other key special reports.
[00:15:40.638 --> 00:15:43.300]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.945]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:15:47.945 --> 00:15:49.367]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:16:00.487 --> 00:16:05.273]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[00:16:06.641 --> 00:16:16.044]  And luckily, our break room at the Infowars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality Infowars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[00:16:16.044 --> 00:16:27.687]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:31.868]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[00:16:32.808 --> 00:16:36.831]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:43.736]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.658]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[00:16:46.658 --> 00:16:56.465]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:00.742 --> 00:17:12.772]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[00:17:12.772 --> 00:17:15.654]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving at
[00:17:15.854 --> 00:17:16.755]  We're good to go.
[00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:36.410]  I like to be expanding.
[00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.170]  I like to be winning.
[00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:37.891]  I like to be fighting.
[00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:39.071]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[00:17:39.071 --> 00:17:39.951]  That's why we're so hated.
[00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:41.571]  But we need to be retreaded.
[00:17:41.571 --> 00:17:42.772]  We need to be tuned up.
[00:17:42.772 --> 00:17:43.852]  We need to be fixed up.
[00:17:43.852 --> 00:17:45.172]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[00:17:45.172 --> 00:17:46.712]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[00:17:46.712 --> 00:17:51.553]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[00:17:51.553 --> 00:17:53.554]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[00:17:53.554 --> 00:17:56.394]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[00:17:56.394 --> 00:17:58.155]  Funded by foreign banks and the Chai Kong Show.
[00:17:58.155 --> 00:17:59.475]  Go to InfowarStore.com.
[00:18:00.742 --> 00:18:02.063]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:18:02.063 --> 00:18:02.803]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.803 --> 00:18:03.423]  Thanks for holding.
[00:18:03.423 --> 00:18:03.764]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:03.764 --> 00:18:06.785]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:18:06.785 --> 00:18:12.889]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:18:12.889 --> 00:18:21.694]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[00:18:21.694 --> 00:18:22.854]  That's it.
[00:18:22.854 --> 00:18:25.496]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:28.357]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:29.638]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[00:18:29.798 --> 00:18:30.559]  I agree entirely.
[00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:36.002]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:18:36.002 --> 00:18:38.784]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:40.845]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:18:40.845 --> 00:18:50.112]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:18:50.112 --> 00:18:52.013]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[00:18:52.013 --> 00:18:58.497]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:18:58.497 --> 00:18:59.438]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:02.020]  Clown World!

[00:19:57.581 --> 00:19:59.002]  Please support us today.
[00:19:59.002 --> 00:20:03.266]  These sales are big!
[00:20:03.266 --> 00:20:06.109]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:10.641 --> 00:20:14.243]  Our main story tonight concerns breast implants.
[00:20:14.243 --> 00:20:21.588]  Some are against them, others believe they're fine in rare cases, and many believe you should be able to get them whenever the f**k you want.
[00:20:21.588 --> 00:20:23.489]  Sorry, did I say breast implants?
[00:20:23.489 --> 00:20:24.930]  I meant abortions.
[00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.591]  Tonight's main topic concerns abortion.
[00:20:26.591 --> 00:20:33.675]  So tonight, in honor of America, I'd like to do a salute to abortion in the break.
[00:20:33.675 --> 00:20:35.256]  10th Annual Salute to Abortion!
[00:20:38.977 --> 00:20:40.459]  Get out of my behind!
[00:20:40.459 --> 00:20:41.521]  Get out of my vagina!
[00:20:41.521 --> 00:20:42.823]  Get out!
[00:20:42.823 --> 00:20:46.888]  It's a woman's body and she should not be forced to carry anything inside of it.
[00:20:46.888 --> 00:20:49.091]  Wouldn't make her keep a tapeworm.
[00:20:49.091 --> 00:20:50.033]  That has a heartbeat.
[00:20:50.033 --> 00:20:52.156]  So you're comparing a baby to a tapeworm?
[00:20:52.156 --> 00:20:54.278]  A fetus is a parasite, sweetie.
[00:20:54.278 --> 00:20:55.961]  That is not what a fetus looks like!
[00:20:58.402 --> 00:21:02.702]  You think that it is the white man's duty to fix everybody's problems, right?
[00:21:02.702 --> 00:21:04.303]  How many did you adopt?
[00:21:04.303 --> 00:21:05.563]  How many did I adopt?
[00:21:05.563 --> 00:21:06.503]  I kill my kids.
[00:21:06.503 --> 00:21:07.684]  Oh, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[00:21:07.684 --> 00:21:09.164]  Yeah, I love it.
[00:21:09.164 --> 00:21:09.684]  You love it, huh?
[00:21:09.684 --> 00:21:10.484]  Yeah, I do.
[00:21:10.484 --> 00:21:12.705]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[00:21:12.705 --> 00:21:14.205]  Oh, I'd never go to Christ.
[00:21:14.205 --> 00:21:15.265]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:16.365]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[00:21:16.365 --> 00:21:18.106]  A fertilized egg is a human being!
[00:21:18.806 --> 00:21:19.607]  Yeah.
[00:21:19.607 --> 00:21:20.628]  Why'd you spit at us?
[00:21:29.592 --> 00:21:31.454]  I, uh, don't agree with you.
[00:21:31.454 --> 00:21:34.277]  No uterus, no right to talk about it.
[00:21:34.277 --> 00:21:35.659]  Understand me, motherfucker?
[00:21:35.659 --> 00:21:45.369]  In the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother, just prior to the birth of the baby.
[00:21:45.369 --> 00:21:52.016]  Now, you can say that that's okay, and Hillary can say that that's okay, but it's not okay with me.
[00:21:52.236 --> 00:21:59.640]  Well that is not what happens in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:07.865]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo lit up the One World Trade Center spire in pink to celebrate his radical expansion of abortion in New York.
[00:22:07.865 --> 00:22:16.009]  State lawmakers approved a law permitting abortion in the state for any reason until the 24th week of pregnancy and then up until birth.
[00:22:16.229 --> 00:22:19.871]  If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[00:22:19.871 --> 00:22:21.912]  The infant would be delivered.
[00:22:21.912 --> 00:22:24.313]  The infant would be kept comfortable.
[00:22:24.313 --> 00:22:29.395]  The infant would be resuscitated, if that's what the mother and the family desired.
[00:22:29.395 --> 00:22:33.537]  And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[00:22:33.537 --> 00:22:35.398]  There was a question over here.
[00:22:35.398 --> 00:22:35.698]  Yes.
[00:22:35.698 --> 00:22:38.700]  Are you for third trimester abortions?
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:42.181]  My answer to you is that that should be a decision that the woman makes.
[00:22:44.778 --> 00:22:50.039]  There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult.
[00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:51.840]  Is it okay to still have children?
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:59.301]  How do you justify the decision to allow Planned Parenthood to rent in this city for free?
[00:22:59.301 --> 00:23:07.763]  There's a new video out on InfoWars.com of two partial birth abortion, eight and a half month old babies.
[00:23:09.315 --> 00:23:12.376]  And, uh, and it makes you want to kill people.
[00:23:12.376 --> 00:23:14.897]  I'm just being honest with you right now.
[00:23:14.897 --> 00:23:21.780]  My guts, my spirit sees a baby who got killed and its brain sucked out by some asshole.
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.261]  And then they make a joke out of it.
[00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:29.143]  These are abortion doctors with third trimester babies that were about to be born.
[00:23:29.143 --> 00:23:32.504]  Defiling them, making jokes about them that they're having a fight.
[00:23:32.504 --> 00:23:36.366]  They're playing with dead babies in a little, um,
[00:23:37.227 --> 00:23:38.547]  Don't knock it till you try it.
[00:23:38.547 --> 00:23:39.868]  And when you do try it, really knock it.
[00:23:39.868 --> 00:23:41.688]  You know, you gotta get that baby out of there.
[00:24:15.006 --> 00:24:20.430]  Aborted babies incinerated to eat UK hospitals.
[00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.573]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:24:24.573 --> 00:24:30.798]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:24:30.798 --> 00:24:36.102]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:24:36.102 --> 00:24:39.405]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[00:24:40.692 --> 00:24:43.193]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:24:43.193 --> 00:24:45.813]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:24:45.813 --> 00:24:50.615]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:24:50.615 --> 00:24:53.595]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:24:53.595 --> 00:24:57.176]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:24:57.176 --> 00:24:58.777]  You must evacuate the area.
[00:25:01.414 --> 00:25:13.825]  The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:25:13.825 --> 00:25:15.786]  So enjoy the flavors!
[00:25:15.786 --> 00:25:20.410]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death penalties and sales taxes.
[00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.352]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:25:22.352 --> 00:25:24.213]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:25:24.213 --> 00:25:25.515]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:25:25.515 --> 00:25:27.096]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:25:27.256 --> 00:25:31.640]  He is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:38.647]  Would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:25:38.647 --> 00:25:42.991]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:25:42.991 --> 00:25:49.257]  They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:25:57.384 --> 00:25:59.965]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:25:59.965 --> 00:26:04.847]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:26:04.847 --> 00:26:07.329]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:26:07.329 --> 00:26:16.613]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:26:16.613 --> 00:26:19.094]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:26:19.774 --> 00:26:21.895]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:26:21.895 --> 00:26:24.237]  The scoops are on their way.
[00:26:24.237 --> 00:26:27.619]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[00:26:27.619 --> 00:26:30.841]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:34.262]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:26:34.262 --> 00:26:35.963]  We gotta stop them!
[00:26:35.963 --> 00:26:36.524]  Come on!
[00:26:36.524 --> 00:26:40.946]  What is the secret of Soylent Green?
[00:26:40.946 --> 00:26:42.607]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:26:46.613 --> 00:26:51.058]  I think they'll be breeding us like cattle.
[00:26:51.058 --> 00:26:56.203]  For food.
[00:26:56.203 --> 00:26:58.786]  You gotta tell them.
[00:26:58.786 --> 00:26:59.867]  InfoWars.
[00:26:59.867 --> 00:27:03.491]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:27:03.491 --> 00:27:04.392]  Ladies and gentlemen...
[00:27:05.183 --> 00:27:09.228]  Don't let the globalists win and get great products you already need.
[00:27:09.228 --> 00:27:20.661]  As much as I work and as much stress as I'm under, if I didn't take the high quality fish oil or the turmeric, my knee and my back and all the things I've been injured doing things over the years would be untenable.
[00:27:21.201 --> 00:27:21.981]  They're great products.
[00:27:21.981 --> 00:27:24.022]  They're all 50% off store-wide.
[00:27:24.022 --> 00:27:25.442]  Theinfomerchstore.com.
[00:27:25.442 --> 00:27:28.383]  Store-wide, free shipping, 50% off, double pay for your points.
[00:27:28.383 --> 00:27:30.804]  That sale's gotta end early next week.
[00:27:30.804 --> 00:27:35.485]  It'll still be a sale on some items, but some things like BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, people already love that.
[00:27:35.485 --> 00:27:36.326]  It's one of our best sellers.
[00:27:36.326 --> 00:27:37.246]  That's selling out.
[00:27:37.246 --> 00:27:39.907]  X2 that I got a big shipment of, it's starting to sell out.
[00:27:39.907 --> 00:27:41.767]  Super Mel Vitality is starting to sell out.
[00:27:41.767 --> 00:27:43.348]  RainForce Plus, it's starting to sell out.
[00:27:43.348 --> 00:27:45.509]  We got a big shipment into the 8-pack Power Stack.
[00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:46.749]  Learn about that total body.
[00:27:46.889 --> 00:27:47.590]  Total support.
[00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:48.571]  It's a great gift as well.
[00:27:48.571 --> 00:27:49.292]  We got plenty of that.
[00:27:49.292 --> 00:27:49.992]  It just came in.
[00:27:49.992 --> 00:27:51.534]  We just got Turbo Force Plus.
[00:27:51.534 --> 00:27:52.375]  Sold out for months.
[00:27:52.375 --> 00:28:00.544]  10-hour clean, healthy energy with all your vitamins, all your minerals, amino acids, and five different types of healthy caffeine and a bunch of other natural boosters.
[00:28:00.544 --> 00:28:01.986]  The time release.
[00:28:01.986 --> 00:28:04.529]  We had to pay a top company a lot of money to give us this formula.
[00:28:04.529 --> 00:28:05.710]  Just for the caffeine release.
[00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:07.732]  This is, this is not, it's over 10 hours.
[00:28:07.732 --> 00:28:08.413]  One release isn't enough.
[00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:11.075]  First two, one of these has been 15 minutes, last two hours.
[00:28:11.075 --> 00:28:13.337]  The other will last about four hours, up to 10 hours.
[00:28:13.337 --> 00:28:15.339]  Clean burn, nothing else like it.
[00:28:15.339 --> 00:28:16.860]  We've got TurboForce back in stock.
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:20.523]  We've got the great Protein Bars, highest quality back in stock.
[00:28:20.523 --> 00:28:21.805]  All of it, 50% off.
[00:28:21.805 --> 00:28:22.825]  Save them for worse.
[00:28:22.825 --> 00:28:23.346]  Special.
[00:28:23.346 --> 00:28:25.067]  Get the apparel, get the books, get the videos.
[00:28:25.067 --> 00:28:26.609]  Whatever you do, just stuff you need to buy.
[00:28:26.609 --> 00:28:29.191]  Get it there and know it stands to defy the globalists.
[00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:30.352]  Thank you for your support.
[00:28:30.352 --> 00:28:32.534]  Again, we could not do it without you, but don't let them win.
[00:28:32.754 --> 00:28:34.395]  Why are they coming after us so much?
[00:28:34.395 --> 00:28:35.896]  The audience gets it.
[00:28:35.896 --> 00:28:38.637]  Because we're promoting Americana, we're defeating the globalists.
[00:28:38.637 --> 00:28:39.998]  How do you defeat them?
[00:28:39.998 --> 00:28:41.119]  Spread it word of mouth.
[00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.359]  The Forbidden Show.
[00:28:42.359 --> 00:28:43.280]  Tell everyone.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.941]  Infowars.com.
[00:28:44.941 --> 00:28:54.546]  We'll be right back with more of this bizarre display of globalist mental illness and tyranny on the other side.
[00:28:54.546 --> 00:28:59.029]  Remember, if you're watching or listening to this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:17.323]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:29:17.423 --> 00:29:21.525]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[00:29:21.525 --> 00:29:25.207]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[00:29:25.207 --> 00:29:26.948]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:29:26.948 --> 00:29:31.191]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[00:29:31.191 --> 00:29:39.115]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:29:39.155 --> 00:29:41.836]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[00:29:41.836 --> 00:29:46.759]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:47.939]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[00:29:47.939 --> 00:29:48.920]  They have side effects.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.820]  Not with Mother Nature.
[00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:53.522]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[00:29:53.522 --> 00:29:55.403]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:30:02.146 --> 00:30:06.249]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30:06.249 --> 00:30:12.572]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[00:30:12.572 --> 00:30:24.779]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:31.163]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is right back
[00:30:31.243 --> 00:30:32.844]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:31:01.064 --> 00:31:04.205]  Briefly folks, please do not forget, this is the maximum alert.
[00:31:04.205 --> 00:31:05.345]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[00:31:05.345 --> 00:31:06.746]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[00:31:06.746 --> 00:31:13.047]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight, but we need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:13.047 --> 00:31:14.908]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[00:31:14.908 --> 00:31:15.448]  There's a P.O.
[00:31:15.448 --> 00:31:16.708]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[00:31:16.708 --> 00:31:18.509]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:22.790]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves in
[00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.693]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.

[00:31:37.665 --> 00:31:38.747]  RainForce Plus.

[00:31:54.053 --> 00:31:55.073]  We need the funding.
[00:31:55.073 --> 00:31:56.074]  Thank you for your support.
[00:31:56.074 --> 00:31:59.115]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[00:31:59.115 --> 00:31:59.955]  We're not going to back down.
[00:32:00.896 --> 00:32:02.237]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:32:02.237 --> 00:32:03.017]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:32:03.017 --> 00:32:03.597]  Thanks for holding.
[00:32:03.597 --> 00:32:04.117]  Hey, Alex.
[00:32:04.117 --> 00:32:06.939]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:32:06.939 --> 00:32:13.061]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:21.865]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[00:32:21.865 --> 00:32:22.806]  That's it.
[00:32:22.806 --> 00:32:25.667]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:32:25.667 --> 00:32:28.528]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:32:28.528 --> 00:32:29.809]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[00:32:29.969 --> 00:32:30.730]  I agree entirely.
[00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:36.173]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:32:36.173 --> 00:32:38.954]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:32:38.954 --> 00:32:41.016]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:32:41.016 --> 00:32:50.261]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:32:50.261 --> 00:32:52.182]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[00:32:52.182 --> 00:32:58.666]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:32:58.666 --> 00:32:59.607]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:16.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.573 --> 00:33:21.854]  Many people are saying, wow, when did the Democratic Party become completely communist?
[00:33:21.854 --> 00:33:31.916]  When did they openly start saying, we're going to take all your guns, we're going to seize your wealth, America's bad, borders are bad, everybody in the world can come here and get free stuff.
[00:33:31.916 --> 00:33:32.536]  When did this start?
[00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:49.874]  Well, in the last 50 years, large corporations and multinational combines began to openly plan for the overthrow of Western civilization by creating large domesticated groups who will demand more and more from their client governments.
[00:33:49.874 --> 00:33:53.756]  And that's why everything I talked about 25 years ago is, quote, now come true.
[00:33:54.893 --> 00:33:58.037]  It was already true in the big foundations.
[00:33:58.037 --> 00:34:01.742]  It was already true inside the major universities.
[00:34:01.742 --> 00:34:06.348]  It was already what they were planning, what they were preparing for their takeover.
[00:34:06.348 --> 00:34:08.691]  The only way to defeat capitalism
[00:34:09.768 --> 00:34:14.011]  It's to basically undermine it and collapse it so people reject it.
[00:34:14.011 --> 00:34:16.093]  Again, that's the Cloward and Piven strategy.
[00:34:16.093 --> 00:34:24.199]  Well, we've all seen the huge hoax going on that there's concentration camps with people in them on the southern border.
[00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:36.288]  The truth is, Latin America and Asia and Africa and many areas are collapsing because of their populations doubling and tripling in size and because they have corrupt socialist governments, like in Venezuela.
[00:34:36.288 --> 00:34:37.149]  And these people are
[00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:45.162]  Coming here, hundreds and hundreds of thousands a month that we're actually catching, hundreds of thousands a month that we don't catch.
[00:34:45.162 --> 00:34:46.985]  Well, Caitlin Bennett went out to St.
[00:34:46.985 --> 00:34:52.615]  Louis, Missouri, our great reporter, she travels across the country, and almost every person she talked to
[00:34:53.357 --> 00:34:56.800]  We're grueling, mindless zombies.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.762]  The name of the report's up on Infowars.com.
[00:34:58.762 --> 00:35:01.624]  It's titled, AOC's Fun Camps.
[00:35:01.624 --> 00:35:09.951]  And they, almost to a person, believe that there are literal death camps that are just as bad as Nazi Germany, or maybe a little bit better.
[00:35:11.172 --> 00:35:13.693]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it's collapsing borders.
[00:35:13.693 --> 00:35:23.458]  People coming in from Uganda, and coming in from Sudan, and pouring in from the Congo, demanding all their free stuff.
[00:35:23.458 --> 00:35:31.121]  And the Democratic Party members all got up on stage and promised them free stuff, free healthcare, free everything.
[00:35:31.121 --> 00:35:34.683]  So this is the fraud that's taking place, and she's out there talking to these people,
[00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:42.341]  And they actually believe that these are concentration camps, where you grab people and put them in them and then work them to death.
[00:35:42.341 --> 00:35:48.290]  No, these are huge processing centers, where 90 plus percent of the people get dumped on the street after a week.
[00:35:49.193 --> 00:35:54.418]  And then go apply for asylum and then never show up, 90% of them again, to the hearings.
[00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.300]  Look up these numbers.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.925]  The only people being sent back are convicted murderers and criminals that are in the system.
[00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:03.487]  All they're doing is letting them pass port.
[00:36:03.487 --> 00:36:05.289]  Our borders are basically open under federal law.
[00:36:06.286 --> 00:36:11.928]  Just like you fly out of the country, they check your passport, check there's no warrants out or whatever, and you're let into the country.
[00:36:11.928 --> 00:36:14.049]  And if you're a person with a visa, you're let out of the country.
[00:36:14.049 --> 00:36:16.950]  Well, these people are coming across where there aren't border checkpoints.
[00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:24.633]  But the left is so ignorant, their followers are, they don't realize what basic borders are in history, or that Mexico has some of the toughest borders in the world.
[00:36:24.633 --> 00:36:24.933]  I think so.
[00:36:46.409 --> 00:36:51.794]  And now we're undermining the very country that's collapsing that has provided so much.
[00:36:51.794 --> 00:36:53.576]  This is the globalist plan.
[00:36:53.576 --> 00:37:05.046]  Represent outsiders, promise them free stuff, bring them in, give them driver's license, let them vote, and then use the democratic system that is here to overthrow that system and convert it to tyranny.
[00:37:05.046 --> 00:37:05.226]  Then,
[00:37:06.514 --> 00:37:12.924]  Once we're done with this report, I'm going to come back with extremely powerful comments by Senator Ted Cruz and others.
[00:37:12.924 --> 00:37:14.327]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:37:14.327 --> 00:37:15.889]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:37:15.889 --> 00:37:19.455]  I mean, honestly, you really believe that there's concentration camps at the border?
[00:37:20.655 --> 00:37:21.195]  Yeah.
[00:37:21.195 --> 00:37:23.837]  Then why are so many people trying to come over?
[00:37:23.837 --> 00:37:25.838]  Um, well, they're trying to get freedom.
[00:37:25.838 --> 00:37:30.982]  They'll do... But all they're going to be met with is a concentration camp, in your words.
[00:37:30.982 --> 00:37:32.022]  Doesn't make sense, does it?
[00:37:32.022 --> 00:37:35.024]  I mean, I don't know much, but... Yeah.
[00:37:35.024 --> 00:37:37.626]  Yeah.
[00:37:37.626 --> 00:37:38.167]  We're here in St.
[00:37:38.167 --> 00:37:38.627]  Louis, Missouri.
[00:37:43.863 --> 00:37:57.281]  And I don't know why we chose this city to come to to ask this question, but we are asking people if they agree with Ocasio-Cortez when she says that detention centers on the U.S.-Mexico border are the same as concentration camps used during World War II.
[00:37:57.281 --> 00:37:59.484]  Let's see if people think that's pretty ridiculous.
[00:38:14.304 --> 00:38:25.137]  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently said that the detention centers used at the US-Mexico border are comparable to the concentration camps used during World War II.
[00:38:25.137 --> 00:38:26.198]  Do you agree with that?
[00:38:26.198 --> 00:38:27.099]  I do, yes.
[00:38:27.099 --> 00:38:28.821]  Do you agree with that notion?
[00:38:28.821 --> 00:38:30.723]  I personally do, yes.
[00:38:30.723 --> 00:38:31.745]  Do you agree with that notion?
[00:38:33.167 --> 00:38:36.830]  Uh, I didn't know about it, but it's not good.
[00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:40.452]  Do you think that that's what we're doing at the border?
[00:38:40.452 --> 00:38:42.454]  Putting them in concentration camps?
[00:38:42.454 --> 00:38:43.314]  I hope not.
[00:38:43.314 --> 00:38:46.517]  Do you agree with Ocasio-Cortez?
[00:38:46.517 --> 00:38:48.438]  Yeah.
[00:38:48.438 --> 00:38:52.041]  So you, I mean honestly, you really believe that there's concentration camps at the border?
[00:38:53.266 --> 00:38:53.806]  Yeah.
[00:38:53.806 --> 00:38:56.448]  Then why are so many people trying to come over?
[00:38:56.448 --> 00:39:00.071]  Um, well they're trying to get freedom, they'll do.
[00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:03.593]  But all they're going to be met with is a concentration camp in your words.
[00:39:03.593 --> 00:39:05.575]  Doesn't make sense, does it?
[00:39:05.575 --> 00:39:08.897]  I mean, I don't know much, but yeah.
[00:39:08.897 --> 00:39:18.143]  So she has recently said that the detention centers at the US-Mexico border are comparable and basically the same as concentration camps used in World War II.
[00:39:19.444 --> 00:39:21.066]  Do you agree with that?
[00:39:21.066 --> 00:39:22.268]  I mean, I personally do.
[00:39:22.268 --> 00:39:30.257]  I think when we look back on history, we always like to think that we're on the right side of history with things and then history repeats itself and everyone's really against it.
[00:39:30.257 --> 00:39:35.663]  So, I mean, I think it's going to take some time for people to kind of see it for what it is.
[00:39:35.663 --> 00:39:37.365]  You know, when you look at the pictures of
[00:39:38.386 --> 00:39:40.147]  Concentration camps is what they look like.
[00:39:40.147 --> 00:39:43.809]  They were just a little bit worse, you know.
[00:39:43.809 --> 00:39:50.233]  But I guess in this day and age, I mean, there's a... It's good to draw correlations, but that's a little over the top for me.
[00:39:50.233 --> 00:39:53.595]  Okay, so you say they're just a little bit worse.
[00:39:53.595 --> 00:39:55.536]  How do you find them similar?
[00:39:55.536 --> 00:39:56.957]  Well, taking
[00:39:57.937 --> 00:40:02.859]  Any demographic and sticking them in one place is how they're similar to me.
[00:40:02.859 --> 00:40:05.600]  What demographic is being stuck in the detention center?
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.061]  Oh, absolutely Hispanic.
[00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:09.322]  Do you think that's a fair comparison?
[00:40:09.322 --> 00:40:09.882]  It depends.
[00:40:09.882 --> 00:40:13.664]  I think for her party, it probably makes sense, right?
[00:40:13.664 --> 00:40:19.066]  But I think that if she really wants to win over all of America, it's going to be tough with such a polarizing comment.
[00:40:19.066 --> 00:40:22.348]  Do you think that most Democrats would agree with her notion that they're the same?
[00:40:23.115 --> 00:40:26.336]  I think that they would, probably, it depends where you are, right?
[00:40:26.336 --> 00:40:30.216]  I think maybe half of Democrats would agree with her comment.
[00:40:30.216 --> 00:40:36.798]  I don't think they're the same, but I feel like it's, because they're not, you know, we're not killing people.
[00:40:36.798 --> 00:40:39.198]  I mean, I hope we're not killing people that we know of.
[00:40:51.275 --> 00:40:52.436]  I don't know, that's a tough one.
[00:40:52.436 --> 00:40:54.838]  I feel like it could be almost the same, but not quite.
[00:40:54.838 --> 00:40:58.881]  I haven't been in a concentration camp, so I don't have anything to compare it with.
[00:40:58.881 --> 00:41:01.763]  Well, I mean, we can hear from people who have been.
[00:41:01.763 --> 00:41:06.227]  Several people are alive today that lived through that concentration camp in Germany.
[00:41:06.227 --> 00:41:10.750]  They're coming out saying that it's not quite the same as what's going on at the border.
[00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.851]  Do you take their word for it?
[00:41:11.851 --> 00:41:14.493]  I mean, are we killing six million people at the U.S.
[00:41:14.493 --> 00:41:16.634]  border and stripping their identities?
[00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:22.216]  Then again, I didn't hear them say it, so I don't, you know, I'm just taking your word for it.
[00:41:22.216 --> 00:41:28.018]  Do you think that even if just one person is killed by illegal immigration that that's a problem and we should do something at the border?
[00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:30.739]  I think anyone being killed is a problem.
[00:41:30.739 --> 00:41:33.880]  I don't think people are being killed due to illegal immigration.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.541]  There's about 4,000 people.
[00:41:35.541 --> 00:41:43.463]  No, I think some illegal immigrants may end up killing people, but that's not the same as saying people are being killed due to illegal immigration.
[00:41:43.823 --> 00:41:53.873]  We have a congresswoman named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who recently compared the detention centers at the US-Mexico border to concentration camps used during World War II.
[00:41:53.873 --> 00:41:54.894]  What are your thoughts on that?
[00:41:54.894 --> 00:41:55.454]  Do you agree?
[00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.011]  All right.
[00:42:00.011 --> 00:42:04.212]  Super male vitality is what he needs to be able to talk about these things.
[00:42:04.212 --> 00:42:05.293]  What a pansy.
[00:42:05.293 --> 00:42:13.296]  Do you think that a detention center for illegals coming across the border would be the same as a concentration camp used in Germany for the Holocaust?
[00:42:13.296 --> 00:42:14.937]  I would hope it wouldn't be.
[00:42:14.937 --> 00:42:16.318]  Do you think that's what's happening?
[00:42:16.318 --> 00:42:18.439]  I have no idea because I haven't researched it.
[00:42:18.439 --> 00:42:25.722]  I mean I know that at the detention centers there's like a lot of people crowded into very small spaces and I like very much disagree with that.
[00:42:26.542 --> 00:42:31.313]  I can see how you would compare that to other spaces where people have been held against their will.
[00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:44.030]  And it's people of Sinus, so it's Mexican people coming across the border, and whereas it was like Jewish people in a lot of the concentration camps, so that part, yeah, maybe a little similar.
[00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:47.272]  Are the pictures from the border showing any, like, chambers?
[00:42:47.272 --> 00:42:49.273]  I didn't say anything to that extent.
[00:42:49.273 --> 00:42:52.494]  I didn't say anything like that, but again, you don't, you don't know.
[00:42:52.494 --> 00:42:55.376]  So it's possible that chambers could be down there?
[00:42:55.376 --> 00:42:55.776]  I don't know.
[00:42:55.776 --> 00:42:58.998]  We've got other special reports coming up, so please stay with us.
[00:43:00.057 --> 00:43:09.940]  In the 40 years that I've been in American politics, I've never seen a situation with the mainstream media in which facts and truth and evidence no longer matters.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:18.943]  The false claim that you purposely sent kiddie porn to the Sandy Hook plaintiffs is ludicrous as well as false.
[00:43:18.943 --> 00:43:20.064]  It's a smear.
[00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:22.265]  Somebody sends you something that's encrypted.
[00:43:22.265 --> 00:43:23.745]  You don't even open it.
[00:43:23.745 --> 00:43:28.767]  It ends up swept up in the discovery of 9 million documents and then it's blamed on you.
[00:43:30.647 --> 00:43:31.768]  This is bizarre.
[00:43:31.768 --> 00:43:37.971]  But the way the mainstream media rushes out to say Jones sent kiddie porn is really outrageous.
[00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:43.653]  I have a lot of respect for those media outlets and those commentators who retracted and corrected and clarified.
[00:43:43.653 --> 00:43:45.194]  But I wonder, where are the big boys?
[00:43:45.194 --> 00:43:46.394]  Where's the Wall Street Journal?
[00:43:46.394 --> 00:43:48.095]  Where's Associated Press?
[00:43:48.095 --> 00:43:53.658]  When are they going to report that they made a mistake and what they said about you was inaccurate?
[00:43:53.658 --> 00:43:59.100]  So we both need your help, and I urge folks to continue to support InfoWars with your dollars.
[00:44:00.154 --> 00:44:02.796]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[00:44:02.796 --> 00:44:04.617]  We're going into the season of war.
[00:44:04.617 --> 00:44:10.682]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[00:44:10.682 --> 00:44:14.365]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[00:44:14.365 --> 00:44:15.266]  We need to end here.
[00:44:15.266 --> 00:44:16.587]  We need to be provisioned.
[00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.248]  And you've got my total commitment.
[00:44:18.348 --> 00:44:21.191]  That I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:25.056]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[00:44:25.056 --> 00:44:26.978]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[00:44:26.978 --> 00:44:30.542]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[00:44:30.542 --> 00:44:31.963]  That just brings more people here.
[00:44:31.963 --> 00:44:35.267]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[00:44:35.267 --> 00:44:36.108]  I need gas.
[00:44:36.108 --> 00:44:37.630]  I need ammo politically now.
[00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:45.434]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[00:44:45.434 --> 00:44:46.855]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[00:44:46.855 --> 00:44:53.879]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[00:44:53.879 --> 00:44:54.859]  You have my commitment.
[00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:59.202]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.
[00:45:00.725 --> 00:45:02.066]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:02.846]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:45:02.846 --> 00:45:03.406]  Thanks for holding.
[00:45:03.406 --> 00:45:03.947]  Hey, Alex.
[00:45:03.947 --> 00:45:06.768]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:45:06.768 --> 00:45:12.872]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:45:12.872 --> 00:45:21.677]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[00:45:21.677 --> 00:45:22.857]  That's it.
[00:45:22.857 --> 00:45:25.479]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:45:25.479 --> 00:45:28.340]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:29.621]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[00:45:29.781 --> 00:45:30.541]  I agree entirely.
[00:45:30.541 --> 00:45:35.982]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:45:35.982 --> 00:45:38.763]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:45:38.763 --> 00:45:40.843]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:45:40.843 --> 00:45:50.085]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:45:50.085 --> 00:45:51.985]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[00:45:51.985 --> 00:45:58.467]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:45:58.467 --> 00:45:59.407]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:46:01.348 --> 00:46:03.349]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:05.370]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:11.873]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:46:11.873 --> 00:46:22.758]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence.
[00:46:23.078 --> 00:46:23.498]  We're good to go.
[00:46:52.944 --> 00:46:54.665]  Last week AOC attempted to launch a Jesse Smollett level hoax.
[00:46:54.665 --> 00:46:56.887]  She went out with Mayor de Blasio and other accomplices
[00:47:23.269 --> 00:47:32.118]  And started crying in front of the camera and broke down because she was looking at the children inside those cages, inside that concentration camp.
[00:47:32.976 --> 00:47:45.280]  Well, there were dozens of other photographers there and they put out larger photos that weren't crops showing that there was nobody on the other side of that fence but a few bored police and a few vehicles.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:59.044]  So now her photographer is going across the internet contacting people like InfoWars and saying you don't have a right, even though he tweeted it out, to show our photo next to other people's photos showing exactly what happened.
[00:48:00.876 --> 00:48:23.565]  First off, ladies and gentlemen, if you're telling people that we have basically death camps on the border, and you're trying to incite violent revolution through that, as the Democratic Party are doing, and then there are a bunch of other photos showing that it's not true, and that she's not breaking down looking at children, it is a public interest for us to show the public what really happened.
[00:48:23.565 --> 00:48:25.926]  It is the very definition of fair use.
[00:48:27.216 --> 00:48:32.159]  She has pulled a political stunt to scare everybody, just like she said the world was going to end in 12 years.
[00:48:32.159 --> 00:48:38.043]  Or she said cauliflower is racist and we shouldn't grow it, even though it actually comes from Africa and the Middle East.
[00:48:38.043 --> 00:48:39.024]  It's insane.
[00:48:39.024 --> 00:48:45.789]  And we have a right to stand up to her and show people the truth, just like we stood up to Jussie Smollett.
[00:48:45.789 --> 00:48:45.969]  Show!
[00:48:46.989 --> 00:48:52.813]  You can go to Infowars.com and Newswars.com and read Paul Joseph Watson's article that details all of it.
[00:48:52.813 --> 00:48:58.356]  Again, here's the article on Newswars.com and Infowars.com that they don't want you to read or see.
[00:48:58.356 --> 00:49:00.177]  So whatever you do, don't share this article.
[00:49:00.177 --> 00:49:02.439]  Do what AOC and her photographers say.
[00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:05.141]  Shut your stinking American mouths.
[00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:11.004]  AOC photographer demands removal of images showing Congresswoman crying over nothing.
[00:49:11.004 --> 00:49:15.167]  Legal threat came after Stunt was condemned as a misleading photo op.
[00:49:15.922 --> 00:49:22.887]  We subscribe to Getty Images so we have all the photos from Getty showing that they cropped the photos so you're not stopping us.
[00:49:22.887 --> 00:49:33.433]  The photographer who took the photos of Alexandria Cortez appearing to cry at a protest outside of Tent City in Texas demanded the removal of the images.
[00:49:33.433 --> 00:49:37.316]  We've got that full list right there and we've got a link to his tweet.
[00:49:37.316 --> 00:49:39.177]  You can see it all for yourself.
[00:49:39.177 --> 00:49:42.439]  So again, because this didn't go as planned, at least up at AOC's level,
[00:49:43.542 --> 00:49:48.048]  We're told to memory hole this out of 1984, but we're not doing it.
[00:49:48.048 --> 00:49:51.492]  Now, shifting gears into what's really happening down there.
[00:49:51.492 --> 00:49:53.295]  Very powerful piece.
[00:49:54.264 --> 00:50:07.616]  With Senator Ted Cruz and Sean Hannity, where Cruz lays out what we've been hammering and hammering and hammering as hard as we can because thousands of children are being killed.
[00:50:07.616 --> 00:50:11.840]  Look, the debate last night, the clown car is broken.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.821]  There's no brake and it only steered left.
[00:50:15.002 --> 00:50:16.403]  I gotta say, that was scary last night.
[00:50:16.403 --> 00:50:23.645]  It was scary to see the Democrats, every one of them, falling all over each other to get further and further and further left.
[00:50:23.645 --> 00:50:38.991]  You saw the Democrats, you just went through it in your monologue powerfully, you saw them embrace late-term abortions, you saw them embrace 70% tax rates, you saw them embrace socialism, you saw them tell the American people they want to take away everyone's health insurance.
[00:50:39.871 --> 00:50:43.533]  And you saw them embrace open borders.
[00:50:43.533 --> 00:50:55.957]  One of the most disturbing exchanges is when several of those candidates began saying they wanted to eliminate the provision in law that makes it illegal to cross the border, that makes it a crime to cross the border illegally.
[00:50:55.957 --> 00:50:57.558]  Now, Sean, as you know, last month,
[00:50:58.498 --> 00:51:03.743]  We apprehended over 144,000 people in the month of May crossing illegally.
[00:51:03.743 --> 00:51:06.786]  Well, the Democrat solution to that is, well, let's not make it a crime.
[00:51:06.786 --> 00:51:07.206]  There we go.
[00:51:07.206 --> 00:51:08.668]  The problem goes away.
[00:51:08.668 --> 00:51:10.009]  That is open borders.
[00:51:10.009 --> 00:51:11.670]  It's irresponsible.
[00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:14.533]  And it is, sadly, where the Democratic Party is today.
[00:51:15.113 --> 00:51:17.856]  Sean, you and I have both been down to the border together.
[00:51:17.856 --> 00:51:24.401]  I'm going to be going on Monday back to the border to really try to highlight the crisis we're having there.
[00:51:24.401 --> 00:51:31.207]  Now, we saw some positive development today in that Congress finally passed what the President asked for, $4.5 billion.
[00:51:31.207 --> 00:51:33.849]  That includes over $1 billion for Border Patrol.
[00:51:33.849 --> 00:51:37.032]  That includes over $200 million for ICE.
[00:51:37.032 --> 00:51:39.214]  That's good, but here's the bad news.
[00:51:39.714 --> 00:51:42.655]  The Democrats in Congress refuse to close the loopholes.
[00:51:42.655 --> 00:51:45.356]  The loopholes that are causing this crisis.
[00:51:45.356 --> 00:51:48.257]  They refuse to do anything to fix the crisis.
[00:51:48.257 --> 00:51:59.140]  And what that means, I'll tell you one of the most disturbing reports I'm getting, Sean, I'm getting more and more reports from law enforcement of cartels and traffickers renting children.
[00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:00.701]  Because the idiotic policy
[00:52:01.201 --> 00:52:08.348]  That the Democrats have put in place is if someone shows up with a child, that they're allowed to stay, they're allowed to go free.
[00:52:08.348 --> 00:52:23.523]  And as a result, you're seeing little children who are suddenly, they're finding more and more instances where they're with adults that are not their parents, that are not their family, that are strangers to them, but the child is essentially their get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:52:23.523 --> 00:52:24.624]  That is cruel.
[00:52:25.365 --> 00:52:28.326]  To incentivize kids being abused like that.
[00:52:28.326 --> 00:52:29.046]  And you know what?
[00:52:29.046 --> 00:52:36.089]  The Democrats on that stage, the Democrats on the stage right now, not a single one of them is willing to do anything to fix it.
[00:52:36.089 --> 00:52:51.355]  Senator Cruz not only adopted our clown world meme, as the President, his son, and everyone else has done, from the debates, he got into the fact that the Border Patrol is telling him that they're kidnapping children to bring them across as get-out-of-jail-free cards.
[00:52:51.355 --> 00:52:51.915]  The cartels.
[00:52:51.915 --> 00:52:53.176]  Well, that's in the Senate report.
[00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.949]  From
[00:53:14.142 --> 00:53:27.595]  Some of what Tucker Carlson had to say about this whole situation and then we'll be back in the second hour with jam-packed highlights of Clown World day one and Clown World day two where the Democrats
[00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:37.551]  In case anyone missed it, the two whitest candidates on stage decided to repeat the point in stilted Spanish.
[00:53:53.476 --> 00:53:54.777]  Got that, Gringo?
[00:53:54.777 --> 00:54:00.383]  You can add the English language to the long and growing list of things the Democratic Party considers racist.
[00:54:00.383 --> 00:54:02.246]  How long before you're banned from speaking it?
[00:54:02.246 --> 00:54:03.187]  Think we're joking?
[00:54:03.187 --> 00:54:03.927]  Right.
[00:54:03.927 --> 00:54:06.530]  Better to learn Español if you want to talk to your grandkids.
[00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:08.372]  It's a brand new world.
[00:54:08.372 --> 00:54:12.296]  Some of the least impressive people in America are making the rules.
[00:54:12.296 --> 00:54:13.438]  Hope you're excited for it.
[00:54:13.438 --> 00:54:15.019]  At least men will be able to get free abortions.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:21.565]  Even when they weren't speaking Spanish, when Democrats argued it was typically an effort to one-up one another on immigration.
[00:54:21.565 --> 00:54:22.526]  Who could be most radical?
[00:54:22.526 --> 00:54:25.869]  Watch this.
[00:54:25.869 --> 00:54:27.210]  I'm talking about everybody else.
[00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:29.192]  But you're looking at just one small part of this.
[00:54:29.192 --> 00:54:32.375]  I'm talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws.
[00:54:32.375 --> 00:54:33.996]  That's not true.
[00:54:33.996 --> 00:54:37.259]  And if we do that, I don't think it's asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country.
[00:54:37.259 --> 00:54:38.601]  I'm talking about millions of folks.
[00:54:39.381 --> 00:54:41.802]  A lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum.
[00:54:50.188 --> 00:54:51.649]  Tucker, good to see you.
[00:54:51.649 --> 00:54:53.250]  Amazing, round two coming up.
[00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:54.731]  You laid it out pretty interestingly.
[00:54:54.731 --> 00:55:01.235]  One of the juiciest parts of this story, though, is that not too long ago, Leon Castro himself said the border crisis was BS.
[00:55:01.235 --> 00:55:02.676]  That's what he told CNN.
[00:55:02.676 --> 00:55:07.299]  Now he's trying to break out of the pact by beating up on the president, so he's saying just the opposite.
[00:55:07.299 --> 00:55:10.260]  It's such a crisis, he said, we need to do something radical.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:14.023]  The words you used a moment ago, so radical, that Democrat Amy Klobuchar said, time out.
[00:55:14.423 --> 00:55:29.203]  She said she'll look at decriminalizing illegal crossings, but said, wait, the real focus should be on going after human traffickers who are hurting women and children and people who are, quote-unquote, violating the law, which, remember, the president has said not for weeks, but he's been saying for years.
[00:55:29.203 --> 00:55:31.586]  Funny, because other big Democrats on stage tonight
[00:55:32.307 --> 00:55:33.727]  For part two, have also flipped.
[00:55:33.727 --> 00:55:38.868]  Kamala Harris said dealing with illegal immigration was a, quote, distraction from the real issues.
[00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:41.349]  Bernie Sanders said there was no crisis.
[00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:46.110]  Not a good look when apprehensions at the border are up 623% from 2017.
[00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:51.771]  Then there's Bill de Blasio, you mentioned a moment ago, pushing that 70% tax rate for the rich.
[00:55:51.771 --> 00:55:53.391]  He and Elizabeth Warren went further.
[00:55:53.391 --> 00:55:58.972]  They raised their hands in favor of ending private health insurance altogether for millions of people.
[00:55:59.432 --> 00:56:05.033]  Democrat John Delaney, who was on the stage last night, told me after, he thinks that's political suicide for his party.
[00:56:05.033 --> 00:56:10.715]  One of the many reasons why the real winner from these two debates, second one starting soon, may be the President of the United States.
[00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:35.069]  Well, NBC brought five separate moderators to last night's debate, almost all of them pure toadies to the Democratic Party, and together they spent, not surprisingly, most of the night tossing softball questions to the candidates, or questions intended to drag out the Russian collusion hysteria.
[00:56:35.069 --> 00:56:35.609]  Here's a selection.
[00:56:36.485 --> 00:56:41.330]  We saw that image today that broke our hearts and they had names.
[00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:46.155]  If you were president today, what would you specifically do?
[00:56:46.155 --> 00:56:49.659]  Do you have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell?
[00:56:49.659 --> 00:56:51.421]  If the House chooses not to impeach,
[00:56:52.535 --> 00:57:00.880]  As president, would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in Mr. Mueller's report?
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:01.421]  No U.S.
[00:57:01.421 --> 00:57:04.983]  president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office.
[00:57:04.983 --> 00:57:11.547]  Do you believe that President Trump could or should be the first?
[00:57:11.547 --> 00:57:12.668]  Is Trump bad?
[00:57:12.668 --> 00:57:14.089]  He's bad.
[00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:15.450]  Lots of softballs.
[00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:21.374]  And yet still, no matter how easy the questions, most people seem to agree that former congressman Beto O'Rourke
[00:57:22.797 --> 00:57:29.744]  After the debate, one obviously smitten MSNBC anchor fussed that he wasn't being taken seriously, Bateau.
[00:57:29.744 --> 00:57:31.405]  Watch.
[00:57:31.405 --> 00:57:44.096]  I do still think it's interesting that there is just a snark to the way you're treated, whether it's by the media or by the other Democrats on stage, and I wonder what your... that's what it looked like to me.
[00:57:44.096 --> 00:57:45.598]  So you're a blushing fangirl.
[00:57:45.598 --> 00:57:48.280]  Okay, should you admit that in public on live TV?
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:48.821]  Probably not.
[00:57:50.697 --> 00:57:55.021]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[00:57:55.021 --> 00:58:02.668]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Awards 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[00:58:02.668 --> 00:58:05.551]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving at
[00:58:05.751 --> 00:58:06.651]  We're good to go.
[00:58:25.356 --> 00:58:26.317]  I like to be expanding.
[00:58:26.317 --> 00:58:27.077]  I like to be winning.
[00:58:27.077 --> 00:58:27.798]  I like to be fighting.
[00:58:27.798 --> 00:58:28.999]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[00:58:28.999 --> 00:58:29.860]  That's why we're so hated.
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.481]  But we need to be retreaded.
[00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:32.702]  We need to be tuned up.
[00:58:32.702 --> 00:58:33.763]  We need to be fixed up.
[00:58:33.763 --> 00:58:35.084]  We never have time to get in a drive-by.
[00:58:35.084 --> 00:58:36.625]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[00:58:36.625 --> 00:58:41.469]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[00:58:41.469 --> 00:58:43.450]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[00:58:43.450 --> 00:58:47.753]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[00:58:47.753 --> 00:58:49.395]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[00:58:51.113 --> 00:58:55.924]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[00:58:57.290 --> 00:59:06.694]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[00:59:06.694 --> 00:59:18.338]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[00:59:18.338 --> 00:59:22.520]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:27.482]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[00:59:27.482 --> 00:59:34.386]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[00:59:34.386 --> 00:59:37.308]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[00:59:37.308 --> 00:59:47.113]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:52.754 --> 00:59:59.298]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.298 --> 01:00:13.327]  Now, last segment, I pointed out that thousands of children are dying, not in these emergency processing centers, where they're just processed out and handed over to the Democrats who God knows what with, including sex trafficking.
[01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:15.498]  I said that thousands are dying.
[01:00:15.498 --> 01:00:16.479]  That's in Mexico.
[01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:18.479]  200 plus thousand people total.
[01:00:18.479 --> 01:00:20.080]  Tens of thousands of children.
[01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.300]  Children being kidnapped, killed, traveled from all over the world.
[01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:27.101]  Thousands of dead is a conservative number on the children.
[01:00:27.101 --> 01:00:31.983]  But of course, Democrats, Socialists, Globalists, they play with the dead bodies of aborted babies.
[01:00:31.983 --> 01:00:34.803]  They want to kill babies after they're born and are now doing it.
[01:00:34.803 --> 01:00:37.104]  There's no value on life in the third world.
[01:00:38.004 --> 01:00:42.788]  It's been the Western Christian ethos that put value on people's lives.
[01:00:42.788 --> 01:00:46.351]  That's what people want to get into here because we are more humane.
[01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:47.992]  We have more welfare.
[01:00:47.992 --> 01:00:49.834]  We take care of people more.
[01:00:49.834 --> 01:00:50.854]  And that's the logic.
[01:00:50.854 --> 01:00:51.955]  That's the reality.
[01:00:51.955 --> 01:00:55.198]  And that's what's being exploited by people saying they're refugees.
[01:00:55.198 --> 01:01:01.603]  Yeah, if somebody can prove they're coming from a war-torn region, and they can prove they're being persecuted, like Christians, let them in.
[01:01:02.446 --> 01:01:08.267]  But if you look at Europe and the UK and even the US, we hardly let Christians that are being persecuted in.
[01:01:08.267 --> 01:01:17.690]  In England, Theresa May wouldn't let a famous woman who had a death sentence in Pakistan, because she was a Christian, come to the UK saying it would upset Muslims.
[01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:23.551]  Christians can't even flee countries where they are facing death to come to the West.
[01:01:23.551 --> 01:01:25.031]  Oh, but we bring the Islamics in.
[01:01:25.031 --> 01:01:30.493]  We won't bring Christians in from Syria, but Obama would sure bring in all the jihadis.
[01:01:30.493 --> 01:01:31.633]  This is the reality.
[01:01:31.633 --> 01:01:31.953]  And so,
[01:01:33.177 --> 01:01:43.992]  You have these soft, stupid, lazy leftists at the ground level that just want to feel morally superior, want to look down on somebody, and think of you as the bad person because they wanted to be the cool kids in school.
[01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:57.446]  But above them are the parasitic corporations and the globalists that hire these criminal politicians who are ruthlessly exploiting our open system to bring in a foreign voting bloc and a permanent underclass.
[01:01:57.446 --> 01:02:02.730]  But now you notice our talking points are mainstream because our talking points aren't just talking points.
[01:02:02.730 --> 01:02:10.095]  Our talking points are research and history and reality and that's why they want Infowars wiped from the face of the earth.
[01:02:10.095 --> 01:02:11.976]  Trump knows Infowars got him elected.
[01:02:13.050 --> 01:02:14.270]  Sean Hannity knows that.
[01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:17.051]  Tucker Carlson knows that.
[01:02:17.051 --> 01:02:17.832]  All of them know that.
[01:02:17.832 --> 01:02:19.933]  Ted Cruz knows that.
[01:02:19.933 --> 01:02:21.693]  And they agree with what I'm saying.
[01:02:21.693 --> 01:02:22.874]  And they agree with the common sense.
[01:02:22.874 --> 01:02:24.974]  But I had to be radical first.
[01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:31.397]  When you're facing radical propaganda and radical globalism, you have to admit what they're doing is out of control.
[01:02:31.397 --> 01:02:35.198]  Even if you sound crazy telling people, hey, they want your guns.
[01:02:35.198 --> 01:02:36.539]  Hey, they want open borders.
[01:02:36.539 --> 01:02:38.979]  Hey, they're pedophiles and want to sexualize children.
[01:02:38.979 --> 01:02:40.540]  Hey, they want a one world government.
[01:02:41.943 --> 01:02:49.912]  I was mercilessly attacked for 25 years for doing that, but now I made it safe for other people to oppose it right as the plan goes into place.
[01:02:49.912 --> 01:02:52.675]  Now I'm not saying this to brag about how great I am.
[01:02:52.675 --> 01:03:00.224]  I'm saying this so you understand why they attack him for war so much, and why they attack you so much, and why they attack Trump so much, or Sean Hannity, or Terry Carlson.
[01:03:00.948 --> 01:03:04.453]  Because they know we're talking about real issues.
[01:03:04.453 --> 01:03:16.512]  They know that what we're talking about are real political and geopolitical and cultural and financial and spiritual points that if the public gets wise to it, it's game over for the NWO.
[01:03:17.674 --> 01:03:19.855]  We had to make it safe, though, to cover real issues.
[01:03:19.855 --> 01:03:21.015]  We had to hit the barbed wire.
[01:03:21.015 --> 01:03:22.576]  We had to be persecuted.
[01:03:22.576 --> 01:03:29.139]  And you as an audience, not of spectators, but of activists in the arena, have stood with us and done this.
[01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:42.024]  And that's why we built these beachheads across the world for nationalism and populism and a rediscovery of family and of Jesus Christ and of self-defense and of free market and of common sense and of the Western ethos.
[01:03:42.024 --> 01:03:45.045]  Because you stood with Infowars.
[01:03:45.545 --> 01:03:52.569]  Because you shared the links, because you prayed for us, because you bought the products, we now have a fighting chance.
[01:03:52.569 --> 01:04:02.975]  That's why I cannot stress to you enough how critical it is that you realize that you are the light in the dark of the night, no matter what color you are or where you came from.
[01:04:02.975 --> 01:04:05.997]  Last night I went to the store because we'd forgotten some stuff.
[01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:07.385]  I don't know.
[01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:31.560]  They have tried to suppress us, but it's blowing up in their face thanks to you spreading the word, thanks to you and your word of mouth.
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.363]  You are doing an amazing job, and that's why the globalists are so scared.
[01:04:35.363 --> 01:04:38.486]  All right, we're going to post this feed up to InfoWars.com.
[01:04:38.486 --> 01:04:39.046]  Please share it.
[01:04:39.046 --> 01:04:46.933]  We're going to go on a break, come back with even more analysis of Clown World, where the Democrats are really showing you who they are and what their real plans are.
[01:04:46.933 --> 01:04:48.454]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.
[01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:13.935]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[01:05:13.935 --> 01:05:17.076]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale
[01:05:17.256 --> 01:05:17.556]  Of course.
[01:05:33.385 --> 01:05:51.152]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:05:51.152 --> 01:05:57.835]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[01:06:04.967 --> 01:06:07.749]  Why are they trying to come here that we suck so bad?
[01:06:07.749 --> 01:06:08.529]  Oh yeah, it's so bad.
[01:06:08.529 --> 01:06:09.310]  Come here legally.
[01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:11.151]  I mean, I don't... Excuse me.
[01:06:11.151 --> 01:06:11.931]  Cory Booker.
[01:06:11.931 --> 01:06:12.072]  Okay.
[01:06:12.072 --> 01:06:13.252]  So he's your friend.
[01:06:13.252 --> 01:06:15.254]  He speaks Spanish.
[01:06:15.254 --> 01:06:16.034]  He wants to rape you.
[01:06:16.034 --> 01:06:17.075]  He wants to feed off you.
[01:06:17.075 --> 01:06:17.995]  That was the most forced...
[01:06:27.641 --> 01:06:30.023]  We need to include everyone in the success of this economy.
[01:06:30.023 --> 01:06:31.004]  But if we want to do that,
[01:06:43.976 --> 01:06:48.317]  We need to include everyone in our democracy.
[01:06:48.317 --> 01:06:56.900]  Every voter needs representation, and every voice needs to be heard.
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:07:00.141]  The current situation is unacceptable.
[01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:04.642]  The president has attacked and demonized immigrants.
[01:07:04.642 --> 01:07:05.543]  It's unacceptable.
[01:07:05.543 --> 01:07:06.163]  I'm going to change this.
[01:07:06.983 --> 01:07:10.626]  So now, imagine a Mexican TV where he's speaking Spanish, or Spanish, like to show off.
[01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.587]  People go, what the hell is this?
[01:07:12.587 --> 01:07:19.572]  So a show of hands, who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated?
[01:07:41.721 --> 01:07:43.442]  May I address that?
[01:07:43.442 --> 01:07:46.566]  First and foremost, it was a mistake to pull out of that deal.
[01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:53.033]  And one of the reasons why we're seeing this hostility now is because Donald Trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation.
[01:07:53.673 --> 01:08:01.235]  Literally, he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program, and he pushed back a nuclear breakout 10, 20 years.
[01:08:01.235 --> 01:08:06.496]  And now we see Iran threatening to go further, and we're being pulled in further and further into this crisis.
[01:08:06.496 --> 01:08:13.337]  I don't believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice.
[01:08:13.337 --> 01:08:22.159]  And, you know, what that means is that just because a woman, or let's also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female,
[01:08:24.282 --> 01:08:29.326]  If poor, doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose.
[01:08:29.326 --> 01:08:29.866]  No, no, no.
[01:08:29.866 --> 01:08:36.592]  I think that anybody who is smarter than a lightbulb that would run as a Democrat realizes that this is the race you sit out.
[01:08:36.592 --> 01:08:38.374]  You just don't want to get involved in this race.
[01:08:38.374 --> 01:08:44.119]  You'll get drug into the mud with these mental incapacitated... I agree.
[01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:45.680]  So let's go back to these ding-dongs.
[01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:46.081]  Here it is.
[01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:50.863]  I mean, look, she looks like a vampire back.
[01:08:50.863 --> 01:08:53.725]  Well, she just got back from another ten lines of coke, so, I mean, come on.
[01:08:53.725 --> 01:08:55.486]  They powdered her nose up.
[01:08:55.486 --> 01:08:57.727]  But even if... But she literally looks like a psychotic demon.
[01:08:57.727 --> 01:09:00.489]  Yeah, she powdered her nose during the break, Alex.
[01:09:00.489 --> 01:09:03.470]  Should there be a rule for the federal government... She's not on drugs, man.
[01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:06.472]  She's a total corporate empty shell.
[01:09:06.472 --> 01:09:10.695]  She's an OCD, uh... I think we had a little mic issue in the back.
[01:09:10.695 --> 01:09:12.816]  Control room, we've got... Vampire, she's not real.
[01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:13.756]  What is going on right now?
[01:09:15.955 --> 01:09:16.836]  Alright.
[01:09:16.836 --> 01:09:19.178]  Yeah, this is disintegrating.
[01:09:19.178 --> 01:09:21.320]  They're having tech issues all the time.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.140]  Let's listen to this.
[01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:25.643]  Look at that call, John.
[01:09:25.643 --> 01:09:30.928]  Gun activism has become a big part of high school life up there in Broward County.
[01:09:31.528 --> 01:09:36.570]  Many of you are calling for the restoration of the assault weapons ban.
[01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:43.073]  But even if it's put in place, there's still going to be perhaps hundreds of millions of guns still on the streets.
[01:09:43.073 --> 01:09:49.016]  Is there a role for the federal government to play in order to get these guns off the streets?
[01:09:49.016 --> 01:09:50.756]  So now they pledge their allegiance.
[01:09:50.756 --> 01:09:52.257]  She's in Joker purple, by the way.
[01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:54.939]  No, no, they're having an audio issue.
[01:09:54.939 --> 01:09:56.080]  They can't even communicate right now.
[01:10:12.085 --> 01:10:13.626]  Guess what, guys?
[01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.808]  We are going to take a quick break.
[01:10:15.808 --> 01:10:24.735]  Hey, hey, Robert.
[01:10:24.735 --> 01:10:25.656]  There's a little honk.
[01:10:25.656 --> 01:10:27.758]  There's a little clown horn on the desk to your right.
[01:10:27.758 --> 01:10:29.059]  Can you give that a honk for us?
[01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:29.599]  Give us a honk.
[01:10:29.599 --> 01:10:30.280]  Give us a little honk.
[01:10:33.995 --> 01:10:35.296]  Welcome to McDonald's!
[01:10:35.296 --> 01:10:40.478]  Let's go back to Chuck Todd, the Democratic Party operative, with his husband, Michael Maddow.
[01:10:40.478 --> 01:10:41.919]  Let's go back to this.
[01:10:41.919 --> 01:10:43.319]  Parkland, Florida.
[01:10:43.319 --> 01:10:44.260]  It's just north of here.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:46.521]  By the way, they tried this five minutes ago.
[01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:48.562]  So we're back to Parkland, Florida.
[01:10:48.562 --> 01:10:49.282]  Take your guns away.
[01:10:49.862 --> 01:10:55.046]  It has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns.
[01:10:55.046 --> 01:10:58.108]  Look at those psychotic eyes over that woman.
[01:10:58.108 --> 01:10:59.449]  I don't want her managing.
[01:10:59.449 --> 01:11:02.512]  What do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there?
[01:11:02.512 --> 01:11:04.413]  I wouldn't want her being a nurse.
[01:11:04.413 --> 01:11:06.935]  And does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it?
[01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:19.161]  So, um, in this period of time that I've been running for president, I've had more than a hundred questions.
[01:11:19.161 --> 01:11:25.488]  And the single hardest question I've gotten, I got one from a little boy and I got one from a little girl.
[01:11:25.488 --> 01:11:29.772]  And that is to say, when you're president, how are you going to keep us safe?
[01:11:31.559 --> 01:11:34.341]  That's our responsibility as adults.
[01:11:34.341 --> 01:11:37.924]  Would you leave the border wide open, you damn piece of work?
[01:11:37.924 --> 01:11:46.271]  But I love how they ignore the fact that the Parkland parent-teachers voted to arm the teachers to protect the kids.
[01:11:46.271 --> 01:11:50.454]  These people are so out of touch with reality, it's next level.
[01:11:50.454 --> 01:11:51.655]  Let them talk, let them talk.
[01:11:56.084 --> 01:11:57.505]  So what can we do?
[01:11:57.505 --> 01:11:59.107]  We can do the things that are sensible.
[01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:00.748]  We can do the universal background checks.
[01:12:00.748 --> 01:12:01.629]  It's Adolf Warren.
[01:12:01.629 --> 01:12:03.110]  We can ban the weapons of war.
[01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.111]  Elizabeth Hitler.
[01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:08.975]  So double down on the research and find out what really works.
[01:12:08.975 --> 01:12:14.820]  Where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:17.822]  We need to treat this like the virus that's killing our children.
[01:12:17.822 --> 01:12:18.182]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:18.182 --> 01:12:21.805]  How many mass shootings happen at a bank where there's armed guards?
[01:12:23.467 --> 01:12:29.571]  What I think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem, which we have not done.
[01:12:29.571 --> 01:12:43.860]  You know, guns in the hands of a collector who's had them for decades, who's never fired, who takes safety seriously, that's very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:47.142]  We can't treat this as an across-the-board problem.
[01:12:47.142 --> 01:12:49.784]  We have to treat it like a public health emergency.
[01:12:52.486 --> 01:12:54.827]  That means making real change in this country.
[01:12:54.827 --> 01:13:02.452]  No, that's it, Robert, because they don't want to admit in so many words that they're going to come for the guns because they know even Democrat voters aren't for that.
[01:13:02.452 --> 01:13:05.213]  So they do this whole, again, it's a cotton candy approach.
[01:13:05.213 --> 01:13:08.575]  Oh, you know, gun violence is bad and we want to protect the kids.
[01:13:10.456 --> 01:13:11.597]  Oh, precisely.
[01:13:11.597 --> 01:13:16.681]  Because if you look at it, one of the main groups they lost in voter support were African American men gun owners.
[01:13:16.681 --> 01:13:19.563]  So Trump made major inroads in them with 2016.
[01:13:19.563 --> 01:13:24.126]  It was a key decisive factor in Wisconsin, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania.
[01:13:24.126 --> 01:13:25.027]  Key states that they won.
[01:13:25.027 --> 01:13:26.008]  That's why she kept dodging it.
[01:13:26.008 --> 01:13:27.249]  In fact, she even contradicted herself.
[01:13:27.509 --> 01:13:27.989]  It was unique.
[01:13:27.989 --> 01:13:32.010]  I mean, the ability of lefty lawyers to contradict themselves is always extraordinary to me.
[01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:39.533]  She says, this is not an across-the-board problem, but it's a public health across-the-board problem, which I don't really have a solution for except to say I'm for a solution.
[01:13:39.533 --> 01:13:42.414]  That isn't actually a solution.
[01:13:42.414 --> 01:13:44.795]  Yeah, and of course none of it makes any sense.
[01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:47.496]  She says she wants to do a research project.
[01:13:47.496 --> 01:13:48.416]  What does that even mean?
[01:13:48.996 --> 01:13:49.677]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:49.677 --> 01:13:53.561]  I would like to stop it somehow, but not necessarily stop it.
[01:13:53.561 --> 01:13:56.084]  I don't want anybody to be mad at me who wants gun control.
[01:13:56.084 --> 01:14:02.932]  I don't want anybody to be mad at me who has the guns and knows that guns lead to better safety than they lead to violence and crime.
[01:14:02.932 --> 01:14:04.674]  So she just can't answer the question.
[01:14:04.674 --> 01:14:09.419]  It was her biggest dodge of the night, and F. Chuck Todd let her off the hook again.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.601]  It's amazing.
[01:14:11.601 --> 01:14:13.563]  Cory Booker looks angry all the time.
[01:14:13.563 --> 01:14:14.684]  Have you ever noticed that?
[01:14:14.684 --> 01:14:17.527]  I was about to say, he's trying to do his Spartacus moment.
[01:14:17.527 --> 01:14:18.107]  At least Clinton.
[01:14:18.107 --> 01:14:23.091]  Clinton would bite his lip and try to do this, I'm really sorry, I feel your pain, I feel your pain.
[01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:29.537]  Whereas Booker is doing this, he's always trying to do, I am Spartacus, I am, I am Spartacus.
[01:14:29.537 --> 01:14:32.159]  I think Rachel Maddow just had her testosterone therapy.
[01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:33.080]  Let's see what she says.
[01:14:34.742 --> 01:14:39.849]  Next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings.
[01:14:39.849 --> 01:14:47.799]  Is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around?
[01:14:48.886 --> 01:14:53.992]  Yeah, Rachel, I'm the dad of a 10-year-old girl, Karina, who's here tonight.
[01:14:53.992 --> 01:14:55.994]  They still can't even get his mic on.
[01:14:55.994 --> 01:15:00.098]  Oh man, that guy, he's gonna make everybody doing the drinking test drunk fast.
[01:15:00.098 --> 01:15:03.762]  This is the second time he's like, check marks, check marks, check marks, check marks.
[01:15:03.762 --> 01:15:07.606]  He talked about his kid, he made sure his kid was in the audience, made sure there was a reference to it.
[01:15:07.606 --> 01:15:10.429]  So he covered like three drinking, he was like, drink, drink, drink.
[01:15:10.689 --> 01:15:13.531]  Those farmers are already under water and in debt.
[01:15:13.531 --> 01:15:15.894]  Their market's closed to them by a trade war.
[01:15:15.894 --> 01:15:20.758]  Otherwise the government admits they're cloud seeding, and so that's what's leading to these floods, but no one will talk about that.
[01:15:20.758 --> 01:15:22.459]  I'm going to fund resiliency in those countries.
[01:15:22.459 --> 01:15:22.960]  I'll give him credit.
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.161]  The media's doing a good job of only focusing on the top five countries.
[01:15:25.161 --> 01:15:25.342]  I agree.
[01:15:25.342 --> 01:15:26.763]  Shut up, Pino O'Rourke.
[01:15:26.763 --> 01:15:28.324]  Let's go to Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer.
[01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:29.585]  I'm going to give him credit.
[01:15:29.585 --> 01:15:30.126]  Go ahead, Barnes.
[01:15:30.806 --> 01:15:32.767]  Uh, well, I'll just give the, uh, the cameraman credit.
[01:15:32.767 --> 01:15:36.748]  Because they're doing a good job keeping the whole Bido doing all of this off the camera.
[01:15:36.748 --> 01:15:42.129]  So that's why they're... What's weird is, everybody, I'm kind of, people, I've had Italians ask me, are you Italian?
[01:15:42.129 --> 01:15:43.030]  And I'm like, no.
[01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:44.290]  So I wave my arms around.
[01:15:44.290 --> 01:15:46.090]  But I do it on time.
[01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:47.571]  Like a little bit before I say it.
[01:15:47.571 --> 01:15:52.392]  With Beckham it's like, I'll tell you, I'm really angry, and now I'm gonna hit you in the face.
[01:15:52.392 --> 01:15:54.473]  I mean, what is up with the delay?
[01:15:59.378 --> 01:16:03.459]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:16:03.459 --> 01:16:09.801]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[01:16:09.801 --> 01:16:22.003]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:16:22.003 --> 01:16:28.765]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is right back at you.
[01:16:28.905 --> 01:16:36.847]  And I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end, but I want to win.
[01:16:36.847 --> 01:16:40.448]  And without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going to be fun.
[01:16:40.448 --> 01:16:41.869]  But that's not what's important.
[01:16:41.869 --> 01:16:43.069]  The enemy could win.
[01:16:43.069 --> 01:16:45.230]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:46.430]  We're being used by God.
[01:16:46.430 --> 01:16:47.670]  You're being used by God.
[01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:48.591]  This is Providence.
[01:16:48.591 --> 01:16:53.092]  So I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[01:16:53.092 --> 01:16:56.773]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:15.458]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are, and how they were the best, and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:19.661]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[01:17:19.661 --> 01:17:23.364]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[01:17:23.364 --> 01:17:25.105]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:17:25.105 --> 01:17:29.349]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[01:17:29.349 --> 01:17:37.255]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:17:37.295 --> 01:17:39.998]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[01:17:39.998 --> 01:17:44.903]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:17:44.903 --> 01:17:46.084]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:17:46.084 --> 01:17:47.065]  They have side effects.
[01:17:47.065 --> 01:17:47.986]  Not with Mother Nature.
[01:17:47.986 --> 01:17:51.690]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:17:51.690 --> 01:17:53.572]  InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.121]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:18:00.121 --> 01:18:00.841]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:18:00.841 --> 01:18:01.481]  Thanks for holding.
[01:18:01.481 --> 01:18:02.002]  Hey, Alex.
[01:18:02.002 --> 01:18:04.823]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:18:04.823 --> 01:18:10.927]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:18:10.927 --> 01:18:19.732]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[01:18:19.732 --> 01:18:20.892]  That's it.
[01:18:20.892 --> 01:18:23.554]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:18:23.554 --> 01:18:26.395]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:18:26.395 --> 01:18:27.676]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:28.596]  I agree entirely.
[01:18:28.596 --> 01:18:34.038]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:18:34.038 --> 01:18:36.839]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:18:36.839 --> 01:18:38.899]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:18:38.899 --> 01:18:48.142]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:18:48.142 --> 01:18:50.043]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[01:18:50.043 --> 01:18:56.525]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:18:56.525 --> 01:18:57.465]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:05.818]  Infowars and free speech and your right to speech has been under unprecedented attack the last year or so.
[01:19:05.818 --> 01:19:10.504]  It's Orwellian, it's biblical, it's authoritarian, it's insane.
[01:19:10.504 --> 01:19:14.248]  And I keep trying to judge and gauge when is the right time
[01:19:15.129 --> 01:19:20.997]  To have to stumble up on deck as the captain of this operation and say, hey, we're sinking.
[01:19:20.997 --> 01:19:25.102]  I've begged for your support before and thanks for keeping us afloat, but this is the real SOS.
[01:19:25.102 --> 01:19:32.011]  If you don't buy a bunch of products and spread the word and keep fighting, InfoWars will be shut down, not just crippled.
[01:19:32.011 --> 01:19:32.852]  And so we've reached that point.
[01:19:33.655 --> 01:19:35.536]  It'll make the enemy happy, but, you know, whatever.
[01:19:35.536 --> 01:19:37.636]  We have withstood so many of their attacks.
[01:19:37.636 --> 01:19:40.197]  We've gone through so much because of your support.
[01:19:40.197 --> 01:19:41.578]  You have been there.
[01:19:41.578 --> 01:19:46.379]  But let me tell you, they are pissed they haven't been successful, and they're giving us their full assault.
[01:19:46.379 --> 01:19:52.521]  So we need your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth now at InfoWarshore.com.
[01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:53.482]  It's your fight.
[01:19:53.482 --> 01:19:57.803]  Decide whether or not you want InfoWars to continue, because we could be shut down.
[01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:04.439]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:30.322 --> 01:20:31.103]  The lynching?
[01:20:31.103 --> 01:20:31.724]  Jesse Smollett.
[01:20:31.724 --> 01:20:33.486]  When's the last time that happened?
[01:20:53.248 --> 01:21:01.670]  But you know the Mexican gangs are the main group killing blacks now.
[01:21:01.670 --> 01:21:04.471]  All over the country, they're killing them and taking over their territory.
[01:21:04.471 --> 01:21:07.272]  That's why the Bloods and Crips have gotten together.
[01:21:07.272 --> 01:21:14.614]  So you've got this black guy saying white people are lynching black people when there's not been a documented case in like 10 years.
[01:21:16.374 --> 01:21:20.396]  I mean, screw... Sorry, Robert, you're a famous civil rights lawyer.
[01:21:20.396 --> 01:21:21.337]  Go ahead, Barnes.
[01:21:21.337 --> 01:21:27.179]  Well, they actually used the Jussie Smollett hoax to pass an anti-lynching bill that had no purpose whatsoever.
[01:21:27.179 --> 01:21:29.500]  That had no relevance whatsoever.
[01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:32.542]  So the fact that he brought that up is evidence of where we're at.
[01:21:32.542 --> 01:21:36.403]  And then I guess he gave all the school children who watched the debate tonight a new excuse.
[01:21:36.403 --> 01:21:39.024]  Mommy, I don't want to go to school because I'm scared.
[01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:43.366]  I'm scared of other... He even said people are scared of being lynched.
[01:21:43.366 --> 01:21:44.587]  This is preposterous.
[01:21:44.907 --> 01:21:50.870]  So that's what they're trying to do to stop the new political realignment, which is people anti-establishment, sick of government corruption.
[01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:59.033]  Really, everybody wants smaller government, but again, the media is there telling them... There's been a political realignment, and there's no way to reverse it.
[01:21:59.033 --> 01:22:02.655]  You can stall it, but like holding a beach ball underwater, it makes it bigger.
[01:22:02.655 --> 01:22:04.876]  Robert Barnes, don't disagree with what I just said.
[01:22:04.876 --> 01:22:06.116]  Do you agree with that, A?
[01:22:06.116 --> 01:22:06.997]  B, where is this going?
[01:22:07.737 --> 01:22:23.964]  Well, you've had multiple political realignments over American history where a political group or group of constituencies realigns their party, their politics, their person, the party they support, the person they support, the policies they support, because that better aligns with their values and their community interests.
[01:22:24.364 --> 01:22:28.027]  And what you're seeing is some of the oldest working-class Democratic areas in the country.
[01:22:28.027 --> 01:22:45.261]  Through Jacksonian Appalachia, from East Texas, all the way through East Tennessee and Western North Carolina, up through Appalachia and Ohio and Western Pennsylvania, now joining the industrial heartland in Michigan and Wisconsin and Indiana and other parts of the upstate New York, going back to core anti-establishment.
[01:22:45.261 --> 01:22:47.743]  Ira, would you call it an American reawakening party?
[01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:49.442]  Very much so.
[01:22:49.442 --> 01:22:53.984]  It's restoring the original American liberty and the original American freedoms.
[01:22:53.984 --> 01:23:06.068]  But who they're at war with is the Chai Kang model of a Chinese social credit model system that the monopolistic oligarchs and the social media coastal elites want to impose on the rest of the world, including America.
[01:23:06.488 --> 01:23:18.826]  And so what it is, is the little d democratic power, the power of the votes, the power of the people, the power of the public, is all aligned in the populist cause, but they're up against those who can disproportionately control the cultural transmission industries.
[01:23:18.826 --> 01:23:22.772]  News, academia, Hollywood, entertainment, and now big tech.
[01:23:23.092 --> 01:23:29.934]  Which is the biggest control, the private monopoly of the public forum, is the biggest threat to the populist revolution having success.
[01:23:29.934 --> 01:23:40.458]  It's why what tonight revealed and unveiled is that they can't have competent, capable candidates on the Democratic nomination side that can adequately or effectively or persuasively voice the opinion of the elites in any way.
[01:23:40.458 --> 01:23:43.139]  I totally agree with you on that because here's my problem.
[01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:49.974]  I'd rather have a big, powerful, mean enemy to tell people about, because we're going to beat them.
[01:23:49.974 --> 01:23:56.620]  They were so pathetic, but they're so massively funded, we can't underestimate their power.
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:02.784]  They were so pathetic, though, that I'm actually concerned, because I don't know how to calculate it yet, but it's just really bad.
[01:24:02.784 --> 01:24:06.247]  The real Democrat candidate is Google and Apple and Facebook and Twitter.
[01:24:06.247 --> 01:24:06.887]  Exactly.
[01:24:06.887 --> 01:24:11.231]  So it doesn't matter how pathetic their minions or slaves are, like Soron.
[01:24:11.231 --> 01:24:12.732]  So let me ask you this, Robert Barnes.
[01:24:15.427 --> 01:24:17.250]  Why do you call this then?
[01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:21.115]  Because, I mean, all over the world they're losing.
[01:24:21.115 --> 01:24:22.737]  They keep doubling down.
[01:24:22.737 --> 01:24:24.179]  The big banks stole the money.
[01:24:24.179 --> 01:24:25.260]  They keep tripling down.
[01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:26.402]  Nothing's working.
[01:24:26.402 --> 01:24:27.483]  Where does this end then?
[01:24:28.439 --> 01:24:38.011]  Well, it's sort of like that HBO show, Succession, where effectively, the Clintons effectively defaced the ability of any Democrat to come up and have a meaningful, effective, persuasive voice.
[01:24:38.011 --> 01:24:41.736]  And the few that do, voice opinions that are against what the Democrats... Hey, stay there!
[01:24:41.736 --> 01:24:46.643]  We've got the Lieutenant Governor of California with our host here.
[01:24:46.943 --> 01:24:50.885]  Some of the issues related to gun control that we're taking in California.
[01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:56.587]  They asked how do you take, whatever the number was, hundreds of millions of weapons off the street in California.
[01:24:56.587 --> 01:24:59.429]  We're doing background checks on ammunition.
[01:24:59.429 --> 01:25:06.572]  So we've got some creative solutions and I think that those will hopefully take center stage tomorrow with Senator Harris.
[01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:12.153]  As Lieutenant Governor of California, is there anyone that you have endorsed yet officially?
[01:25:12.153 --> 01:25:35.008]  Yes, of course, I've endorsed my Senator, but I will also say that I'm very much a believer that as Democrats across the country really start to peel back the layers and examine their choices, that we need to stay positive, that we need to decide who we're for, and help our candidates deliver their message and help voters decide.
[01:25:35.535 --> 01:25:40.339]  Is there anyone you think that has a chance to defeat Trump in 2020?
[01:25:40.339 --> 01:25:49.827]  Anyone who is the Democratic nominee is going to have the full force of the Democratic Party and people who believe in American democracy behind them.
[01:25:49.827 --> 01:25:57.553]  I strongly believe that and I am really very confident that our party is going to come together behind our nominee.
[01:25:58.260 --> 01:26:01.901]  So, during this debate, who do you think stood out the most to you?
[01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:04.822]  Like, who did the best job in the debate?
[01:26:04.822 --> 01:26:12.004]  Look, I think that it was really an opportunity for all the candidates to define themselves a little bit.
[01:26:12.004 --> 01:26:16.205]  And with so many of them and so little time, it was hard to get too far beyond that.
[01:26:17.045 --> 01:26:20.908]  But frankly, I think Elizabeth Warren did a really good job.
[01:26:20.908 --> 01:26:29.415]  I think that, interestingly, Mayor de Blasio from New York really kind of had an opportunity to talk about this.
[01:26:29.415 --> 01:26:34.479]  We should ask her if her son is named Typhus.
[01:26:34.479 --> 01:26:37.461]  Sorry.
[01:26:37.461 --> 01:26:40.664]  Ask her about the piles of trash and Typhus breaking out in LA.
[01:26:41.502 --> 01:26:48.744]  What do you think about the crisis right now in California where we have homeless people, we've got typhus outbreaks?
[01:26:48.744 --> 01:26:50.724]  What's going on with that?
[01:26:50.724 --> 01:26:54.225]  California, like any state, has our challenges.
[01:26:54.225 --> 01:26:57.026]  We are a state of 40 million people.
[01:26:57.026 --> 01:27:01.027]  We have a homeless crisis, an affordability crisis that sadly by
[01:27:01.997 --> 01:27:07.083]  You know, has come along with our economic growth.
[01:27:07.083 --> 01:27:16.455]  But we also have people in Sacramento in our legislature, a new governor, lieutenant governor, who work together collaboratively and cooperatively.
[01:27:16.455 --> 01:27:17.877]  Lots of different opinions.
[01:27:18.417 --> 01:27:24.339]  But at the same time, you don't have the kinds of clear take-off politics that we see in Washington.
[01:27:24.339 --> 01:27:27.700]  So I'm very optimistic about our state in addressing some of the challenges.
[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:35.742]  What do you have to say to some people that criticize the Democratic Party saying that a lot of blue cities have these homeless problems?
[01:27:35.742 --> 01:27:38.423]  So homelessness is a problem in California.
[01:27:38.423 --> 01:27:41.044]  Homelessness is a problem across the country.
[01:27:41.044 --> 01:27:43.725]  A lot of that has to do with mental health issues.
[01:27:44.405 --> 01:27:50.247]  And, you know, we are finding new ways to try to address the problem.
[01:27:50.247 --> 01:27:54.208]  And one of the biggest in California is we just have to build more housing.
[01:27:54.208 --> 01:28:03.431]  So that is very much at the forefront of our... Ask her what she makes about San Francisco having the most billionaires but also a poverty problem.
[01:28:03.431 --> 01:28:05.612]  What do you think Kamala Harris can do for the U.S.?
[01:28:05.612 --> 01:28:11.834]  Or what do you think that she'll bring to the table that, I guess, President Trump isn't bringing right now to solve these problems?
[01:28:12.867 --> 01:28:20.273]  Well, first of all, what she's going to bring to the table is compassion and the fact that we have to deal with this challenge as a humanitarian crisis.
[01:28:20.273 --> 01:28:24.296]  And we cannot forget that America is a nation of immigrants.
[01:28:24.296 --> 01:28:25.317]  That is who we are.
[01:28:25.317 --> 01:28:40.808]  And starting with the place of compassion is not a place of anger and vindictiveness that has driven him and his wife out of the two-person policies that Billionaire Pete Smith is carrying children apart and away from their families.
[01:28:40.808 --> 01:28:42.650]  It's just absolutely unacceptable.
[01:28:43.090 --> 01:28:51.938]  At the same time, what we're really grappling with here is now decades of inaction when it comes down to some really
[01:28:58.399 --> 01:29:00.421]  Robert Marantz, what has Big Tech become?
[01:29:00.421 --> 01:29:02.443]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[01:29:02.443 --> 01:29:08.949]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[01:29:08.949 --> 01:29:21.020]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:22.201]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[01:29:22.461 --> 01:29:24.823]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:29:52.421 --> 01:29:54.202]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[01:29:54.202 --> 01:29:56.124]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:29:56.124 --> 01:29:57.404]  Even it is what you just saw.
[01:29:57.404 --> 01:30:01.427]  I want to be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[01:30:01.427 --> 01:30:03.228]  We're going into the season of war.
[01:30:03.228 --> 01:30:06.651]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have.
[01:30:06.651 --> 01:30:09.312]  There's their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[01:30:09.312 --> 01:30:12.975]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[01:30:12.975 --> 01:30:13.896]  We need to end here.
[01:30:13.896 --> 01:30:15.216]  We need to be provisioned.
[01:30:15.216 --> 01:30:19.019]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy.
[01:30:19.099 --> 01:30:30.566]  Fearlessly, I'm loving every minute of this, because I know I'm getting under their skin, I'm bloodying them up politically, I'm banging heads with them, and they can't help but attack back with lies, and that just brings more people here.
[01:30:30.566 --> 01:30:36.250]  So I'm in one hell of a fight, and so are you, and I need war bonds, I need gas, I need ammo politically now!
[01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:44.053]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[01:30:44.053 --> 01:30:45.473]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[01:30:45.473 --> 01:30:52.496]  I want to raise a couple million dollars, right now, to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[01:30:52.496 --> 01:30:53.476]  You have my commitment.
[01:30:53.476 --> 01:30:57.818]  This only gives me more energy, and more understanding of what we're facing, and that we were right about this.

[01:31:58.882 --> 01:32:00.242]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:32:00.242 --> 01:32:01.023]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:32:01.023 --> 01:32:01.583]  Thanks for holding.
[01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:01.963]  That's it.
[01:32:01.963 --> 01:32:04.944]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:32:04.944 --> 01:32:07.885]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:32:07.885 --> 01:32:09.406]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:32:27.972 --> 01:32:28.732]  I agree entirely.
[01:32:28.732 --> 01:32:34.175]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:32:34.175 --> 01:32:36.956]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:32:36.956 --> 01:32:39.016]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:32:39.016 --> 01:32:48.280]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.181]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[01:32:50.181 --> 01:32:56.664]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:32:56.664 --> 01:32:57.604]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:33:01.249 --> 01:33:09.099]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.099 --> 01:33:12.804]  All right, welcome back, and the debate is underway with opening statements by Bernie Sanders.
[01:33:12.804 --> 01:33:17.450]  We just had him make a statement, and let's join this with Joe Biden making his statement.
[01:33:18.564 --> 01:33:20.725]  Ordinary middle-class Americans build America.
[01:33:20.725 --> 01:33:22.366]  My dad used to have an expression.
[01:33:22.366 --> 01:33:25.387]  He said, Joe, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.
[01:33:25.387 --> 01:33:26.308]  It's about your dignity.
[01:33:26.308 --> 01:33:27.208]  It's about respect.
[01:33:27.208 --> 01:33:31.070]  It's being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything's going to be okay.
[01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:36.773]  Too many people who are in the middle class and poor have had the bottom fall out under this proposal.
[01:33:36.773 --> 01:33:39.294]  What I'm saying is that we've got to be straightforward.
[01:33:39.734 --> 01:33:48.379]  We have to make sure we understand that to return dignity to the middle class, they have to have insurance that is covered and they can afford it.
[01:33:48.379 --> 01:33:53.381]  They have to make sure that we're in a situation where there's continuing education and they're able to pay for it.
[01:33:53.381 --> 01:33:59.565]  And they have to make sure that they're able to breathe air that is clean and they have water that they can drink.
[01:34:00.345 --> 01:34:03.086]  Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation.
[01:34:03.086 --> 01:34:18.131]  We do have enormous income inequality and the one thing I agree on is we can make massive cuts in the 1.6 trillion dollars in tax loopholes out there and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy.
[01:34:18.131 --> 01:34:26.133]  The people who've been in government for the last 30 years who were around when this problem was created to be... Wait, how did this guy make the stage?
[01:34:26.133 --> 01:34:27.754]  He said he would nuke them if they didn't put him on.
[01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:33.726]  He threatened violence against the DNC if they didn't put him on the debate stage.
[01:34:33.726 --> 01:34:36.067]  What's the odds he talks about guns here in his first discussion?
[01:34:45.050 --> 01:35:03.822]  Who has the guts to take on Wall Street, to take on the fossil fuel industry, to take on the big money interests who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country?
[01:35:12.127 --> 01:35:13.087]  Moderate, moderate.
[01:35:13.087 --> 01:35:15.608]  One clown at a time!
[01:35:15.608 --> 01:35:17.789]  I'll tell you one thing.
[01:35:17.789 --> 01:35:25.372]  It's really nice that we've got all these plans, but if you think we're gonna beat Donald Trump by just having all these plans, you've got another thing coming.
[01:35:25.372 --> 01:35:31.634]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[01:35:34.545 --> 01:35:36.746]  Oh yeah, free for all.
[01:35:36.746 --> 01:35:41.967]  Everybody in the world, come to America, you get a free education and free health care, so why wouldn't they come to... You know what?
[01:35:41.967 --> 01:35:45.949]  No wall is going to keep people out if you give them free health care and free education.
[01:35:45.949 --> 01:35:48.209]  You would be irrational not to come here.
[01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:51.150]  I believe with the show of hands you did not raise your hand.
[01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:51.931]  Oh no, I raised mine.
[01:35:51.931 --> 01:35:52.811]  Did you raise your hand?
[01:35:52.811 --> 01:35:53.611]  I raised it.
[01:35:53.611 --> 01:35:54.651]  Okay, sorry, sorry.
[01:35:54.651 --> 01:35:55.912]  I didn't hear the question.
[01:35:55.912 --> 01:35:58.273]  I was like, everybody else has got their hand up, my hand's up.
[01:35:58.273 --> 01:35:59.793]  Which is different than Obamacare.
[01:35:59.793 --> 01:36:00.853]  Both of my hands are up.
[01:36:00.853 --> 01:36:01.874]  Can you explain that change?
[01:36:01.874 --> 01:36:01.994]  Yes.
[01:36:02.754 --> 01:36:10.516]  You cannot let, as the mayor said, you cannot let people who are sick, no matter where they come from, no matter what their status, go uncovered.
[01:36:10.516 --> 01:36:11.616]  You can't do that.
[01:36:11.616 --> 01:36:12.896]  It's just going to be taken care of.
[01:36:12.896 --> 01:36:13.176]  Period.
[01:36:13.176 --> 01:36:13.897]  You have to.
[01:36:13.897 --> 01:36:15.417]  It's a humane thing to do.
[01:36:15.417 --> 01:36:16.497]  But here's the deal.
[01:36:16.497 --> 01:36:19.138]  The deal is that he's right about three things.
[01:36:19.138 --> 01:36:30.000]  Number one, they, in fact, contribute to the well-being of the country, but they also, for example, they've increased the lifespan of Social Security because they have a job, they're paying a Social Security tax.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.001]  That's what they're doing.
[01:36:31.001 --> 01:36:32.101]  It's increased the lifespan.
[01:36:32.401 --> 01:36:40.887]  They would do the same thing in terms of reducing the overall cost of health care by them being able to be treated and not wait till they're an extremist.
[01:36:40.887 --> 01:36:44.129]  The other thing is, folks, look, we can deal with these insurance companies.
[01:36:44.129 --> 01:36:50.194]  We can deal with the insurance companies by, number one, putting insurance executives in jail for the misleading
[01:36:50.934 --> 01:36:57.236]  They're misleading advertising, what they're doing on opioids, what they're doing paying doctors to prescribe.
[01:36:57.236 --> 01:37:06.599]  We could be doing this by making sure everyone who is on Medicare, that the government should be able to negotiate the price for whatever the drug costs are.
[01:37:06.599 --> 01:37:10.961]  We can do this by making sure that we're in a position that we in fact allow people
[01:37:12.335 --> 01:37:15.317]  Decriminalization of the border.
[01:37:15.317 --> 01:37:16.818]  Massive business.
[01:37:16.818 --> 01:37:19.820]  Billions of dollars made by CPS bureaucracy.
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:22.381]  No due process, kidnapping of kids, but they don't care.
[01:37:22.381 --> 01:37:23.762]  Without documentation.
[01:37:23.762 --> 01:37:27.844]  Can we keep our hands up so we can see them?
[01:37:27.844 --> 01:37:32.547]  The average American is woefully undereducated about the history of race in the United States.
[01:37:32.547 --> 01:37:35.248]  Vice President Biden, we're going to get to you, hang on.
[01:37:35.248 --> 01:37:37.169]  I would like to speak on the issue of race.
[01:37:42.219 --> 01:37:48.226]  So, on the issue of race, I couldn't agree more that this is an issue that is still not being talked about truthfully and honestly.
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.622]  Her parents are really upset that she's doing this again.
[01:38:05.622 --> 01:38:10.745]  Her parents have begged her to quit playing the race card, but she keeps doing it.
[01:38:10.745 --> 01:38:18.209]  Growing up, my sister and I had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents couldn't play with us because we were black.
[01:38:18.209 --> 01:38:25.394]  And I will say also that in this campaign, we've also heard, and I'm going to now direct this at Vice President Biden,
[01:38:27.078 --> 01:38:29.640]  I do not believe you are a racist.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:36.244]  And I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground.
[01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:42.688]  But I also believe, and it's hurtful.
[01:38:42.688 --> 01:38:48.311]  I think we should just stop this and ask each one of them individually, all ten of them, are you a racist?
[01:38:48.311 --> 01:38:50.412]  Have you ever been associated with a racist?
[01:38:55.390 --> 01:39:02.274]  And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing.
[01:39:02.274 --> 01:39:10.058]  And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools.
[01:39:10.058 --> 01:39:11.059]  And she was bused to school.
[01:39:11.059 --> 01:39:15.862]  Politically, she had to do this because Biden's support is dominant amongst older African Americans.
[01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:23.409]  So, I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats.
[01:39:23.409 --> 01:39:25.330]  We have to take it seriously.
[01:39:25.330 --> 01:39:27.371]  We have to act swiftly.
[01:39:27.371 --> 01:39:35.757]  As Attorney General of California, I was very proud to put in place a requirement that all my special agents beware of the cameras and keep those cameras closed.
[01:39:35.757 --> 01:39:38.519]  The longest 30 seconds in Democrat hate history, by the way.
[01:39:38.519 --> 01:39:39.720]  Yep, exactly.
[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.801]  They've got interesting clocks.
[01:39:40.801 --> 01:39:41.701]  It's basically free time.
[01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:42.121]  Fair enough.
[01:39:47.012 --> 01:39:47.852]  And I was with Obama.
[01:39:47.852 --> 01:39:50.413]  She designed that to be video viral.
[01:39:50.413 --> 01:39:52.634]  It worked, too.
[01:39:52.634 --> 01:39:55.194]  It's a mischaracterization of my position across the board.
[01:39:55.194 --> 01:39:57.515]  I did not praise racists.
[01:39:57.515 --> 01:39:59.655]  That is not true, number one.
[01:39:59.655 --> 01:40:06.097]  Number two, if you want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights, whether I did or not, I'm not going to do that.
[01:40:06.097 --> 01:40:07.497]  I'm a public defender.
[01:40:07.497 --> 01:40:08.758]  I didn't become a prosecutor.
[01:40:08.758 --> 01:40:13.839]  I came out, I left a good law firm to become a public defender, when in fact, when in fact,
[01:40:14.966 --> 01:40:16.847]  He took the bait, that was a mistake.
[01:40:16.847 --> 01:40:19.049]  Wow, he really bit the bait.
[01:40:19.049 --> 01:40:19.790]  He completely...
[01:40:43.908 --> 01:40:46.649]  I mean, Trump is gonna wipe him.
[01:40:46.649 --> 01:40:48.310]  He's no competition.
[01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:50.550]  Trump is the master troll.
[01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:55.432]  If Kamala can troll Biden into this bait, then... He took it full throttle.
[01:40:55.432 --> 01:40:58.233]  And the idiot failed to mention his Barack card.
[01:40:58.233 --> 01:40:59.253]  Didn't even play it.
[01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:01.294]  Didn't even play the Barack card!
[01:41:01.294 --> 01:41:03.995]  Not just only African Americans, but the LGBT community.
[01:41:03.995 --> 01:41:08.016]  But, Vice President Biden, do you agree today?
[01:41:08.016 --> 01:41:09.197]  Do you agree today?
[01:41:10.097 --> 01:41:12.680]  That you were wrong to oppose busing in America.
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:17.184]  This is an issue that less than 1% of Americans care about or ever think about.
[01:41:17.184 --> 01:41:18.646]  It's purely symbolic.
[01:41:18.646 --> 01:41:20.448]  It's just symbolic politics.
[01:41:20.448 --> 01:41:22.630]  That's what I oppose.
[01:41:22.630 --> 01:41:27.255]  There was a failure of states to integrate public schools in America.
[01:41:27.255 --> 01:41:30.538]  He's actually going to defend his busing position.
[01:41:30.538 --> 01:41:31.319]  Just run away from that.
[01:41:31.939 --> 01:41:33.701]  Nobody's worried about bussing happening right now, Joe.
[01:41:33.701 --> 01:41:36.223]  Identity politics is all they've got to deceive each other.
[01:41:36.223 --> 01:41:39.485]  Because they're all so far to the left and to Marxist socialism.
[01:41:39.485 --> 01:41:40.346]  This was smart, though.
[01:41:40.346 --> 01:41:42.348]  Politically savvy on Kamala Harris' part.
[01:41:44.378 --> 01:41:46.940]  That's why we need to pass the Equality Act.
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:48.621]  That's why we need to pass the ERA.
[01:41:48.621 --> 01:41:55.006]  Because there are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.
[01:41:55.006 --> 01:41:56.787]  I have supported the ERA from the very beginning.
[01:41:56.787 --> 01:41:58.889]  We all knew Biden was low-hanging fruit.
[01:41:58.889 --> 01:42:02.672]  I don't think any of us expected Kamala Harris to be the one to knock it off the tree.
[01:42:02.672 --> 01:42:03.753]  Exactly.
[01:42:03.753 --> 01:42:04.954]  No doubt about it.
[01:42:04.954 --> 01:42:05.914]  But you know what?
[01:42:05.914 --> 01:42:08.256]  For the throat.
[01:42:08.256 --> 01:42:13.000]  Willie Brown was a skilled man and she learned at the knees of a very skilled person.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.064]  That we, in fact, deal with the notion of denying people access to the ballot box.
[01:42:19.064 --> 01:42:22.566]  I agree that everybody wants they in fact... Anyway, my time's up.
[01:42:44.161 --> 01:42:47.325]  That diversity brings to this contest and to these issues.
[01:42:58.251 --> 01:43:14.123]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:43:14.123 --> 01:43:15.844]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:43:15.844 --> 01:43:26.752]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:43:26.932 --> 01:43:27.913]  We're good to go.
[01:43:46.849 --> 01:43:49.870]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:44:04.662 --> 01:44:14.067]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:44:14.067 --> 01:44:25.693]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:44:25.693 --> 01:44:29.895]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:44:30.815 --> 01:44:34.838]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:44:34.838 --> 01:44:41.743]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:44:41.743 --> 01:44:44.665]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[01:44:44.665 --> 01:44:54.451]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:58.541 --> 01:44:59.882]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:44:59.882 --> 01:45:00.662]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:45:00.662 --> 01:45:01.222]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:01.222 --> 01:45:01.763]  Hey, Alex.
[01:45:01.763 --> 01:45:04.584]  Yeah, I just want to say, uh, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:45:04.584 --> 01:45:10.708]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:45:10.708 --> 01:45:19.493]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[01:45:19.493 --> 01:45:20.453]  That's it.
[01:45:20.453 --> 01:45:23.315]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:45:23.315 --> 01:45:26.156]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:45:26.156 --> 01:45:27.457]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:45:27.617 --> 01:45:28.358]  I agree entirely.
[01:45:28.358 --> 01:45:33.821]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:45:33.821 --> 01:45:36.602]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:45:36.602 --> 01:45:38.664]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:45:38.664 --> 01:45:47.909]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:45:47.909 --> 01:45:49.830]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:56.314]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:45:56.314 --> 01:45:57.235]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:03.802]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[01:46:03.802 --> 01:46:11.446]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:46:11.446 --> 01:46:14.328]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[01:46:14.688 --> 01:46:15.349]  I don't know.
[01:46:34.139 --> 01:46:35.099]  I like to be expanding.
[01:46:35.099 --> 01:46:35.860]  I like to be winning.
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:36.580]  I like to be fighting.
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:37.760]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:38.641]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:46:38.641 --> 01:46:40.261]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:46:40.261 --> 01:46:41.461]  We need to be tuned up.
[01:46:41.461 --> 01:46:42.542]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:46:42.542 --> 01:46:43.862]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[01:46:43.862 --> 01:46:45.403]  We got a lot of holes shot in us.
[01:46:45.403 --> 01:46:47.723]  And the enemy wants to silence us.
[01:46:47.723 --> 01:46:50.244]  Then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:46:50.244 --> 01:46:52.225]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[01:46:52.225 --> 01:46:55.086]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[01:46:55.086 --> 01:46:56.526]  Funded by foreign banks and the TICOM.
[01:46:56.526 --> 01:46:58.167]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[01:47:01.168 --> 01:47:03.804]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.682 --> 01:47:17.184]  Now that there is a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, several Republican-controlled states have passed laws to severely restrict their manpower.
[01:47:17.184 --> 01:47:18.544]  Maybe she didn't see the news today.
[01:47:18.544 --> 01:47:20.084]  I don't think they've got a conservative majority.
[01:47:20.084 --> 01:47:21.304]  They have a Hamptons majority.
[01:47:21.304 --> 01:47:28.006]  During your presidency, if you're elected president, what is your plan if Roe is struck down in the court while you're president?
[01:47:28.006 --> 01:47:28.726]  Roe is struck down.
[01:47:28.726 --> 01:47:37.668]  Well, my plan is somebody who believes for a start that a woman's right to control her own body is a constitutional right.
[01:47:38.528 --> 01:47:41.610]  Except when it comes to vaccines.
[01:47:41.610 --> 01:47:44.991]  You've got to take those.
[01:47:44.991 --> 01:47:45.852]  Your body, your choice.
[01:47:45.852 --> 01:47:47.873]  Until the baby is born, then the government's in control.
[01:47:47.873 --> 01:47:54.336]  And if you want to use stem cells, if that's your stem cells from your body, we're not going to let you have that choice either.
[01:47:55.296 --> 01:48:03.901]  Any, nominate any justice to the Supreme Court, unless that justice is 100% clear he or she will defend Roe v. Wade.
[01:48:03.901 --> 01:48:07.863]  Third of all, I do not believe in packing the court.
[01:48:07.863 --> 01:48:12.506]  We got a terrible 5-4 majority conservative court right now.
[01:48:12.506 --> 01:48:19.570]  But I do believe that constitutionally we have the power to rotate judges to other courts.
[01:48:20.531 --> 01:48:24.159]  We're not gonna pack the court, but we're gonna pack the court.
[01:48:28.746 --> 01:48:35.972]  A woman has the right to control her own body, and the corporations cannot run the United States of America.
[01:48:35.972 --> 01:48:37.914]  Senator, I'm going to give you ten additional seconds.
[01:48:37.914 --> 01:48:39.375]  The corporations are running, Ernie.
[01:48:39.375 --> 01:48:41.637]  That was a bumble bumble right there.
[01:48:41.637 --> 01:48:43.859]  Overturned Roe, and Roe is gone.
[01:48:43.859 --> 01:48:46.842]  All of the things you just described would be to try to preserve Roe.
[01:48:46.842 --> 01:48:50.285]  If Roe is gone, what could you do as president to preserve abortion rights?
[01:48:50.285 --> 01:48:51.626]  Well, first of all, let me tell you this.
[01:48:51.626 --> 01:48:54.208]  It didn't come up yet, but let's face this.
[01:48:55.109 --> 01:49:03.892]  Medicare for all guarantees every woman in this country the right to have an abortion if she wants it.
[01:49:03.892 --> 01:49:05.032]  Thank you, Senator.
[01:49:05.032 --> 01:49:07.313]  Can I just address this for a second?
[01:49:07.313 --> 01:49:09.894]  And the taxpayers will be forced to pay for it.
[01:49:09.894 --> 01:49:10.714]  To America's women.
[01:49:11.354 --> 01:49:14.195]  Trying to protect babies from being killed by your likes.
[01:49:33.862 --> 01:49:44.010]  I think we need to stop the Supreme Court from defining life, defining baby, defining marriage, getting out of their constitutional limits.
[01:49:49.213 --> 01:49:51.215]  Other women's rights work together with sex cults.
[01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:10.453]  What we need to know is... Isn't that supposed to be the Affordable Care Act?
[01:50:10.453 --> 01:50:21.781]  When we beat President Trump, and Mitch McConnell walks into the Oval Office, God forbid, to do negotiations, who do you want, when that door closes, to be sitting behind that desk, to fight for women's rights?
[01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:26.684]  I have been the fiercest advocate for women's reproductive freedom for over a decade.
[01:50:26.684 --> 01:50:32.068]  And I promise you, as President, when that door closes, I will guarantee women's reproductive freedom no matter what.
[01:50:32.188 --> 01:50:37.391]  Do you know what she does behind those doors to get political influence?
[01:50:37.391 --> 01:50:49.037]  We in fact built 500,000 recharging stations throughout the United States of America working with governors, mayors, and others so that we can go to a full electric vehicle future by the year 2020.
[01:50:49.037 --> 01:50:50.578]  By the year 2030.
[01:50:50.578 --> 01:50:53.339]  I would make sure that we invested 400 million dollars.
[01:50:53.339 --> 01:50:56.161]  Like the Chevy Cruze that's out of business now that Obama endorsed?
[01:50:56.161 --> 01:50:56.461]  Yeah.
[01:50:56.641 --> 01:50:58.962]  Senator Sanders, I want to give you nine seconds.
[01:51:25.729 --> 01:51:26.930]  Some numbers over here.
[01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:31.075]  The old ways are no longer relevant.
[01:51:31.075 --> 01:51:36.640]  The scientists tell us we have 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:38.502]  This is a global issue.
[01:51:38.502 --> 01:51:40.404]  We've got to get everybody back to the cities by 2030.
[01:51:40.404 --> 01:51:41.085]  That's the UN timeframe.
[01:51:42.446 --> 01:51:44.989]  So he's got the AOC, so we're going to be all dead in 12 years.
[01:51:44.989 --> 01:51:47.071]  We have met the enemy and he is us.
[01:52:00.126 --> 01:52:05.813]  Who said that her goal is to make New Zealand the place where it's the best place in the world for a child to grow up.
[01:52:05.813 --> 01:52:07.314]  And I will tell her girlfriend you are so wrong.
[01:52:07.314 --> 01:52:08.055]  Make America New Zealand again?
[01:52:08.055 --> 01:52:13.121]  Because the United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.
[01:52:13.121 --> 01:52:15.444]  She's queen clown tonight.
[01:52:15.444 --> 01:52:17.246]  That was something right there.
[01:52:17.666 --> 01:52:22.830]  I would call the Prime Minister of New Zealand and say, go girl.
[01:52:22.830 --> 01:52:25.612]  Guys, I guess we'll get Make America New Zealand again.
[01:52:25.612 --> 01:52:28.455]  Make America New Zealand again.
[01:52:28.455 --> 01:52:33.819]  Guys, it's millions of families trying to come to America, not New Zealand.
[01:52:33.819 --> 01:52:36.361]  People are trying to raise their kids in this country.
[01:52:36.361 --> 01:52:38.282]  What the hell is she talking about?
[01:52:38.282 --> 01:52:40.945]  We're coming back to the debate, so let's join the debate.
[01:52:40.945 --> 01:52:42.025]  They've returned from their break.
[01:52:42.025 --> 01:52:43.627]  Single life in Parkland.
[01:52:44.347 --> 01:53:02.291]  I'll approach this issue as a prosecutor, I'll approach it as the only person on this stage who has voted and passed background checks, but also as a parent of a generation who sends our children to school where we look at what they're wearing so we can remember it in case we have to identify them later.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:13.887]  A generation who has seen thousands of black children killed in our streets and a generation who goes to the theater and we actually look where the fire exits are.
[01:53:13.887 --> 01:53:15.548]  We don't have to live this way.
[01:53:15.548 --> 01:53:19.071]  We must be a country who loves our children more than we love our guns.
[01:53:19.751 --> 01:53:25.098]  If you love your children, you have guns to protect them.
[01:53:25.098 --> 01:53:25.778]  That's right.
[01:53:25.778 --> 01:53:28.742]  I remember when we had guns in the back of pickup trucks all the time.
[01:53:28.742 --> 01:53:29.943]  No seatbelts.
[01:53:29.943 --> 01:53:34.469]  But it's incredible to keep going back to Parkland to say we need gun control.
[01:53:34.989 --> 01:53:38.591]  The Parkland School Board voted to arm the teachers!
[01:53:38.591 --> 01:53:44.696]  So the one example that they keep using, Parkland, Parkland, Parkland, Parkland voted to arm the teachers!
[01:53:44.696 --> 01:53:46.177]  Parkland voted for guns!
[01:53:46.177 --> 01:53:54.302]  I mean, it's unbelievable the ignorance and the lies that these candidates can get away with because they know their voters are so stupid!
[01:53:54.302 --> 01:53:56.323]  And they know the media won't challenge them on it.
[01:53:56.323 --> 01:53:58.185]  And they're prosecuting the...
[01:53:59.557 --> 01:54:02.960]  Government minder who was supposed to protect everybody and failed to do so.
[01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:09.704]  Here you have a guy, Senator Sanders, who through most of his career opposed various gun control efforts and now is completely flip-flopped.
[01:54:09.704 --> 01:54:10.725]  This is actually incredible.
[01:54:10.725 --> 01:54:15.909]  Bernie Sanders just lied and there's a wide open opportunity for anybody on this panel to do it.
[01:54:15.909 --> 01:54:21.153]  In 1990, Bernie Sanders received so much NRA funding, he defeated a Republican.
[01:54:21.693 --> 01:54:24.655]  Because the Republicans said he would ban assault weapons and Bernie said he wouldn't.
[01:54:24.655 --> 01:54:26.036]  There was a whole exposé on this.
[01:54:26.036 --> 01:54:28.117]  Bernie Sanders is openly lying right now.
[01:54:28.117 --> 01:54:31.920]  There is a wide-open gash bleeding out of Bernie Sanders' head.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:34.842]  Will any of these Democrats take the punch and blow this wide open?
[01:54:34.842 --> 01:54:37.383]  He just said a bold-faced lie.
[01:54:37.383 --> 01:54:40.926]  He got NRA funding in 1990 because he said he wouldn't ban assault weapons.
[01:54:41.513 --> 01:54:43.174]  Will you buy them back?
[01:54:43.174 --> 01:54:48.279]  If people want to buy, if the government wants to do that, if people want to bring the government, will you buy them back?
[01:54:48.279 --> 01:54:49.780]  Senator Harris, we're going to give you 30 seconds.
[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:50.180]  Thank you.
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:52.182]  I think your idea is a great one, Congressman.
[01:54:52.182 --> 01:54:55.285]  If you don't want to sell, they'll just take it out of your hand and kill you.
[01:54:55.285 --> 01:54:59.988]  The problem is Congress has not had the courage to act, which is why when elected President of the United States,
[01:55:00.789 --> 01:55:07.972]  I will give the United States Congress 100 days to pull their act together, bring all these good ideas together, and put a bill on my desk for signature.
[01:55:07.972 --> 01:55:10.674]  And if they do not, I will take executive action.
[01:55:10.674 --> 01:55:13.755]  So she's running for dictator, not president, right?
[01:55:13.755 --> 01:55:16.696]  The most comprehensive background check policy we've had.
[01:55:16.696 --> 01:55:21.959]  I will require the ATF to take the licenses of gun dealers who violate the law.
[01:55:21.959 --> 01:55:25.821]  And I will ban, by executive order, the importation of assault weapons.
[01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:26.581]  Because I'm going to tell you,
[01:55:26.701 --> 01:55:31.802]  And then we'll have a civil war, and maybe we'll fix the government at that point.
[01:55:31.802 --> 01:55:38.804]  I have hugged more mothers who are the mothers of homicide victims, and I have attended more police officer funerals.
[01:55:38.804 --> 01:55:40.004]  It is enough.
[01:55:40.004 --> 01:55:40.724]  It is enough.
[01:55:40.724 --> 01:55:43.685]  There have been plenty of good ideas from members of the United States Congress.
[01:55:43.685 --> 01:55:45.045]  There's been no action.
[01:55:45.045 --> 01:55:46.626]  As president, I will take action.
[01:55:46.626 --> 01:55:48.026]  Mayor Buttigieg, I want to bring you in on this, sir.
[01:55:50.353 --> 01:55:55.195]  A lot of discussion about assault rifles that are often shorthanded as military-style weapons.
[01:55:55.195 --> 01:56:01.177]  You are the only person on this stage tonight with military experience as a veteran of the Afghanistan War.
[01:56:01.177 --> 01:56:02.478]  Will military families...
[01:56:03.650 --> 01:56:06.011]  Does that inform your thinking on this view?
[01:56:06.011 --> 01:56:17.678]  Do you believe that military families or America's veterans will, at large, have a different take on this than the other Americans who we've been talking about and who Congressman Swalwell is appealing to with his buyback program?
[01:56:17.678 --> 01:56:21.620]  Yeah, of course, because we trained on some of these kinds of weapons.
[01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:24.142]  Look, every part of my life experience informs this.
[01:56:24.142 --> 01:56:28.004]  Being the mayor of a city where the worst part of the job is dealing with violence
[01:56:28.784 --> 01:56:33.248]  We lose... He's got more shootings in his city per capita than the person by a long shot.
[01:56:33.248 --> 01:56:36.610]  Two or three years in my city alone.
[01:56:36.610 --> 01:56:39.953]  And this is tearing communities apart.
[01:56:39.953 --> 01:56:43.796]  If more guns made us safer, we'd be the safest country on earth.
[01:56:43.796 --> 01:56:44.717]  It doesn't work that way.
[01:56:47.311 --> 01:56:49.694]  Same with laws, jackass.
[01:56:49.694 --> 01:56:51.917]  Same with free healthcare and free everything.
[01:56:51.917 --> 01:56:55.001]  Apply that logic on the full spectrum.
[01:56:55.001 --> 01:56:58.226]  How'd that drug prohibition work out for you?
[01:56:58.226 --> 01:57:01.129]  Oh, well, it didn't work out too well, so let's try gun prohibition now.
[01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:05.335]  And the reality is there's no correlation between gun ownership and gun violence.
[01:57:05.335 --> 01:57:06.216]  It just doesn't exist.
[01:57:06.216 --> 01:57:08.518]  Every statistical survey around the world has looked at it.
[01:57:08.518 --> 01:57:11.562]  No, really, it's being fueled by drug prohibition.
[01:57:11.562 --> 01:57:12.283]  A real 30 seconds?
[01:57:12.283 --> 01:57:13.645]  A real 30 seconds.
[01:57:13.645 --> 01:57:16.328]  I'm the only person that beat the NRA nationally.
[01:57:16.328 --> 01:57:18.771]  I'm the guy that got the Brady Bill passed, the background checks.
[01:57:19.031 --> 01:57:19.852]  Number one.
[01:57:19.852 --> 01:57:25.976]  Number two, we increased that background check during the Obama-Biden administration.
[01:57:25.976 --> 01:57:28.838]  I'm also the only guy that got assault weapons banned.
[01:57:28.838 --> 01:57:29.818]  Banned.
[01:57:29.818 --> 01:57:31.840]  And the number of clips in a gun.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:32.760]  Banned.
[01:57:32.760 --> 01:57:35.602]  And so folks, look, and I would buy back those weapons.
[01:57:35.602 --> 01:57:37.444]  We already started talking about that.
[01:57:48.729 --> 01:58:05.394]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are, and how they were the best, and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:58:05.394 --> 01:58:12.797]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down, and the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements, because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[01:58:13.177 --> 01:58:14.918]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:58:14.918 --> 01:58:19.160]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:27.104]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:58:27.104 --> 01:58:29.825]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[01:58:29.825 --> 01:58:34.708]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:58:34.708 --> 01:58:35.909]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:58:35.909 --> 01:58:36.729]  They have side effects.
[01:58:36.889 --> 01:58:41.471]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:58:41.471 --> 01:58:43.372]  Infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:50.123 --> 01:58:54.204]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:58:54.204 --> 01:59:00.545]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[01:59:00.545 --> 01:59:11.067]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars.
[01:59:11.067 --> 01:59:12.748]  You went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:59:12.748 --> 01:59:17.809]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[01:59:17.809 --> 01:59:19.129]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[01:59:19.229 --> 01:59:20.830]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:59:51.288 --> 01:59:53.894]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
