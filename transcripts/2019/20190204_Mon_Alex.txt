[00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:06.908]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:00:06.908 --> 00:00:08.609]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.250]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.953]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.998 --> 00:00:48.181]  It's Monday, February 4th, 2019.
[00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:51.063]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:51.063 --> 00:00:57.889]  We're gonna be here live for the next four hours when The War Room kicks off with Owen Schroyer.
[00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:02.553]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of things have come together.
[00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:04.455]  A lot of really important things have come into focus.
[00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:12.415]  And the globalists and their operations are just getting more and more out of control and more and more insane.
[00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:24.682]  And as the public revolts against them, they're only resisting the people with more bullying, more censorship, more attacks, which is only outraging the public that much faster.
[00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:38.440]  Filed lawsuit today in Alabama against the Southern Poverty Law Center, an international crime syndicate that actually creates fake KKK and white supremacist groups.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.542]  They were heavily involved in Oklahoma City.
[00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:46.707]  They have billions in secret slush funds overseas that have been exposed.
[00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:50.191]  They are the heart of the globalist criminal operation.
[00:01:51.345 --> 00:02:03.689]  And they're also the core of working with the big banks and working with the big Hollywood cartels to ban and demonize even mainline Christian and conservative organizations.
[00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.311]  So they are the closest thing to Nazis we have in America, trying to keep people out of commerce, out of free speech.
[00:02:10.311 --> 00:02:13.272]  Very, very dangerous group.
[00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:15.713]  Powerful press release up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:20.070]  Dealing with the fact that he filed the suit.
[00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.674]  In fact, we had it up first this morning, then added the press release earlier.
[00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:26.256]  We'd agreed to not release the press release until 8 a.m.
[00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:27.057]  this morning.
[00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:29.359]  Powerful press release, and he's filing a...
[00:02:31.107 --> 00:02:34.389]  Big lawsuit there against them.
[00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.470]  This is part of survival for himself and everybody else.
[00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.432]  So he'll be exclusively joining us via the telephone in the next segment.
[00:02:41.432 --> 00:02:45.655]  And then in about an hour or so, they're set to have a live press conference.
[00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:50.197]  We've got a feed of that that we'll run part of coming up.
[00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:51.538]  Oh, now he's joining us via Skype.
[00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:52.918]  Earlier it was going to be phones.
[00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:56.600]  He'll be joining us via Skype coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.402]  But he's striking back and we want to commend him.
[00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:04.003]  For the work he's doing, stand with Gavin McInnes.
[00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:07.764]  And again, that's DefendGavin.com.
[00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:14.706]  So we'll be carrying all that at Infowars.com, where we have the feed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:17.887]  So that's coming up next segment.
[00:03:17.887 --> 00:03:21.368]  This is just your run-of-the-mill article at Infowars.com.
[00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:27.530]  Austria, white girls wearing headscarves to prevent harassment from Muslim migrants.
[00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.871]  Ron Paul, shut down the TSA.
[00:03:30.885 --> 00:03:34.966]  Peter Schiff, financial crisis bigger than 2008 is incoming.
[00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:39.854]  That's just some of the important news we're going to be getting.
[00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:45.398]  And then, you know, I've been pretty much ignoring Joe Rogan because he has a long-form podcast.
[00:03:45.398 --> 00:03:49.701]  I've known him for almost, I guess it's 20 years now or more.
[00:03:49.701 --> 00:03:51.863]  But I hadn't really paid attention to what he'd been up to the last few years.
[00:03:51.863 --> 00:03:56.226]  Now that I've started investigating him, my lord!
[00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:59.989]  Wow, he's a much worse actor than I thought.
[00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.630]  Bad actor.
[00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.894]  And he's doing things, and Jack Dorsey's doing things that sent
[00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:07.942]  Martha Stewart to prison!
[00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:15.638]  So, I mean, you scratch the surface with Rogan, it's just stunningly criminal in my view.
[00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:18.179]  And I'm just ashamed of myself for not doing more.
[00:04:18.179 --> 00:04:20.900]  By the way, his audience has completely turned on him.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.921]  50,000 downvotes to 7,000.9.
[00:04:24.921 --> 00:04:28.002]  And that's even with him deleting a lot of the downvotes.
[00:04:28.002 --> 00:04:29.542]  I was watching it in live time last night.
[00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:30.603]  It's fascinating.
[00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:31.883]  All his videos are being downvoted.
[00:04:31.883 --> 00:04:35.244]  Tens of thousands of people are unsubscribing every few hours.
[00:04:35.244 --> 00:04:37.685]  Everyone's turning against him, separate from what I've been exposing.
[00:04:38.565 --> 00:04:48.089]  And his response is, YouTube's announced, this is official, they're removing the down vote for their poor baby Joe Rogan.
[00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:49.790]  He is their opponent.
[00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.490]  I had no idea.
[00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.392]  If he hadn't joined the dark side before, he's joined it totally.
[00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:56.353]  Pure, pure evil.
[00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:18.745]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:28.830]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:37.355]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:39.536]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:05:39.536 --> 00:05:40.696]  You must experience it.
[00:05:40.696 --> 00:05:42.777]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:05:42.777 --> 00:05:47.680]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.221]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:05:49.221 --> 00:05:50.682]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:57.385]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:05:57.385 --> 00:05:58.866]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[00:06:16.312 --> 00:06:17.433]  InfoWars.
[00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:18.613]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:29.958]  Today.
[00:06:29.958 --> 00:06:31.098]  Big Brother.
[00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:32.899]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:34.780]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.481]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:36.481 --> 00:06:38.261]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:40.562]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:06:40.562 --> 00:06:42.983]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:44.504]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:47.372 --> 00:06:51.256]  Well, Gavin McInnes has been fired from his job.
[00:06:51.256 --> 00:06:57.041]  He's been taken off almost every major platform that's out there, just like you're truly.
[00:06:57.041 --> 00:07:01.546]  Because he's a patriot, because he supports America, because he stood up against the globalists.
[00:07:02.535 --> 00:07:28.512]  And now, today, he's filed suit against the Southern Poverty Law Center, a true hate-filled, evil, anti-American organization, as close to Nazis as you could actually get, in my view, funding Nazi groups, funding provocateurs, heavily involved in Oklahoma City, heavily involved in just every form of evil you can imagine, absolutely dedicated to destroying free speech and demonizing good people and kicking people even out of commerce.
[00:07:29.412 --> 00:07:37.343]  So the general public is unable to even be able to have bank accounts if you're a mainline Christian or conservative group.
[00:07:37.343 --> 00:07:46.035]  This is the new reign of terror, the Chinese communist social score system that the Southern Poverty Law Center is in command of.
[00:07:46.892 --> 00:08:00.926]  They're the ultimate arbiter, even above the ADL, even above Media Matters, and then they give you the designation of the Scarlet Letter, or the Yellow Star, and you are disappeared into an electronic gulag.
[00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:08.213]  Just absolutely stunning, and a very powerful press release is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:11.135 --> 00:08:20.057]  And Gavin goes through all of this and coming up in about an hour he's going to have a big press conference that we're going to be streaming live at Infowars.com here on this show.
[00:08:20.057 --> 00:08:21.038]  We'll be simulcasting.
[00:08:21.038 --> 00:08:23.338]  You can also go to DefendGavin.com.
[00:08:23.338 --> 00:08:29.100]  But they've gone to his house and harassed his family.
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.961]  They have come out and said Mary Poppins is racist.
[00:08:34.961 --> 00:08:38.182]  The leftist groups are now saying that Boston is racist itself.
[00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:43.849]  And because half the football team is white, that it's a white supremacist football team.
[00:08:44.636 --> 00:08:45.396]  Thanks for having me, buddy.
[00:09:15.123 --> 00:09:19.787]  Well, your press release really says it all, but talk about why you're doing this.
[00:09:19.787 --> 00:09:33.759]  Well, I'm doing this not because of me, and I did get brutally battered with social media and PayPal and being doxxed and my family and friends being attacked and my buddies, the Proud Boys, getting rounded up.
[00:09:34.526 --> 00:09:37.807]  And arrested and charged with felonies for defending themselves.
[00:09:37.807 --> 00:09:41.208]  That's obviously a big part of this impetus.
[00:09:41.208 --> 00:09:44.289]  But I'm also doing it for the average American.
[00:09:44.289 --> 00:09:52.951]  I mean, the SDLC has positioned themselves with such immense power that they are now infiltrating not just big tech,
[00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:54.873]  Well, they decide who can say what.
[00:09:54.873 --> 00:10:00.298]  But they're getting involved in banking and they're getting involved with the way everyone can do business.
[00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:03.882]  They're bankrupting people and they're ruining innocent people's careers.
[00:10:03.882 --> 00:10:08.347]  I mean, I'm doing this as much for me as I'm doing it for Deputy Brian Greene.
[00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:13.994]  Who was fired from Louisiana law enforcement for being a proud boy.
[00:10:13.994 --> 00:10:17.756]  This guy volunteered doing women's self-defense on the weekends.
[00:10:17.756 --> 00:10:19.397]  He's a stalwart of the community.
[00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:22.019]  Graduated ahead of his class in the academy.
[00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:24.240]  And he's now lucky if he can get air conditioning work.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:36.043]  Or Jennifer Morse from the Ruth Institute, who dared to say that when we're adopting kids, maybe we should err on the side of mother-father parents as opposed to gay parents?
[00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:43.926]  That's all she said, and her bank called her up and said, no, you can't bank with us anymore.
[00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:49.607]  Why are we giving these bratty, busybodies power over all of our lives?
[00:10:49.607 --> 00:10:51.128]  It doesn't bode well for America.
[00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:57.501]  And your press release and what your law firm has pointed out is absolutely on target, 110%.
[00:10:57.501 --> 00:11:12.427]  It is a consortium of leftist so-called watchdog groups, Southern Poverty Law Center with billions in secret offshore accounts, that's been admitted, all their assorted corruption, all the lawsuits they've been losing, on record saying, we want to destroy Gavin McInnes, we want to destroy Alex Jones.
[00:11:12.427 --> 00:11:13.587]  These are quotes.
[00:11:13.587 --> 00:11:16.789]  Then they go out and say lies about us that are then picked up
[00:11:17.629 --> 00:11:17.709]  It's
[00:11:40.194 --> 00:11:48.400]  That scarlet letter around your neck, when they put that yellow star on you, you are being sent to total unemployment and being physically attacked.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:51.682]  I mean, and they admit these are bullying monsters.
[00:11:51.682 --> 00:11:55.805]  And if you study what the Nazis did for the first few years, they didn't really kill people.
[00:11:55.805 --> 00:11:59.268]  They just took your banking away and took your stores away and took your shops away.
[00:12:00.467 --> 00:12:05.850]  Yeah, they put signs in your window that said, this is a Jew shop, don't shop here.
[00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:09.512]  And we're getting this now with this, hate has no home here in shop windows.
[00:12:09.512 --> 00:12:12.474]  I mean, or Proud Boys getting kicked out of various bars.
[00:12:12.474 --> 00:12:15.096]  They're not allowed to go to this establishment or that establishment.
[00:12:15.096 --> 00:12:17.937]  But I'm glad you brought up earlier the electronic gulag.
[00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:20.299]  This is actually worse than communism.
[00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:27.163]  Because in communism, you would go to the gulag, you'd go to the re-education camp, and you'd come back vindicated.
[00:12:27.723 --> 00:12:32.564]  In today's America, with this witch hunt, you're never vindicated.
[00:12:32.564 --> 00:12:43.868]  So once you're a bigot, once you're a homophobe, racist, transphobe, anti-semi, whatever, that's permanently on your record, thanks to the SPLC, and you can never recover from that.
[00:12:43.868 --> 00:12:50.269]  The people that I'm representing here, the people that I'm fighting for, they'll always be Google-able as part of a hate group.
[00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:55.571]  And they, you know, the SPLC starts with bonafide bigots, maybe like 5% of their total list.
[00:12:56.031 --> 00:13:07.735]  And then they just spread that out and include everyone remotely Christian, everyone remotely conservative, and they make this massive hate map that makes America look like a racist hellhole!
[00:13:08.485 --> 00:13:14.246]  And that's really why I'm fighting, because I'm sick of this depiction of all of us being prejudiced.
[00:13:14.246 --> 00:13:16.607]  It's not true.
[00:13:16.607 --> 00:13:34.410]  At the same time, you point out that they literally create heat maps that just act like America is, like almost every white person is a frothing KKK member, and then a lot of minorities now, a minority of them, are becoming hardcore racists and actually saying whites inherently are evil, like New York Times
[00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.973]  Board members and mainstream media hosts, they're the ones mainlining hate.
[00:13:38.973 --> 00:13:41.874]  I mean, these people say things more hateful than David Duke does.
[00:13:41.874 --> 00:13:52.861]  And I don't support David Duke, but David Duke is a gentleman compared to the lady at the New York Times that calls whites subhuman goblins that live in holes.
[00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:54.602]  She can't wait till they all die.
[00:13:54.602 --> 00:13:59.785]  I mean, I don't like what David Duke has to say, but he doesn't say, kill all the black people.
[00:13:59.785 --> 00:14:00.706]  This is outrageous.
[00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:03.177]  No, they're getting people killed.
[00:14:03.177 --> 00:14:12.602]  And when you depict America as this racist hellhole where cops hunt black people for sport, then a black guy is in a dangerous confrontation.
[00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:14.903]  He says he did something wrong and he's fighting with the cops.
[00:14:14.903 --> 00:14:16.544]  He thinks, well, I'm going to die anyway.
[00:14:16.544 --> 00:14:19.245]  I might as well go out in a blaze of glory.
[00:14:19.245 --> 00:14:23.227]  And the next thing you know, he's wielding a weapon going, well, these cops are all racist.
[00:14:23.227 --> 00:14:25.249]  I might as well keep fighting until I die.
[00:14:25.249 --> 00:14:26.089]  And now you just got that guy.
[00:14:26.169 --> 00:14:29.690]  And then CNN says, well, cops are bad, that's why they're getting killed a few years ago.
[00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:35.573]  I know you've got to go, but I want to finish up on the other side, how people can support you, and what's going to happen at the press conference today.
[00:14:35.573 --> 00:14:38.374]  But just briefly, it's in your press release too.
[00:14:38.374 --> 00:14:44.517]  Multiple people have been shot and attacked by SPLC minions operating off their heat map.
[00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:47.538]  I mean, they use this as like a guidance system for their missiles.
[00:14:48.857 --> 00:14:51.059]  Yes, the Family Research Council.
[00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:58.404]  The black security guard was shot defending them, and the guy who shot them said he wanted to kill as many people as he could.
[00:14:58.404 --> 00:15:01.867]  The Steve Scalise shooting was based on the SPLC hate group.
[00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:11.174]  Just the other day, Charles Murray was at Middlebury College, and the students were so rabid that the professor who got in the way of the attack was hospitalized.
[00:15:11.174 --> 00:15:13.836]  This is all due to the SPLC's hate group.
[00:15:13.836 --> 00:15:16.398]  They are fomenting hate.
[00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.079]  They are a hate group.
[00:15:19.462 --> 00:15:30.417]  Well also, Proud Boys is a defensive organization and it takes any color, a lot of gay guys in it, whatever, and the idea that this was some offensive group, no.
[00:15:30.417 --> 00:15:32.259]  They stood up to bullies.
[00:15:32.259 --> 00:15:33.201]  They defended themselves.
[00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:39.204]  Remember those Catholic boys the other day who were accused of disrupting a ceremony?
[00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:40.324]  They said that they, uh...
[00:15:59.344 --> 00:16:03.227]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[00:17:28.729 --> 00:17:35.091]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:38.132]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:38.132 --> 00:17:44.054]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:44.054 --> 00:17:47.835]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.835 --> 00:17:49.096]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:49.096 --> 00:17:50.436]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:56.638]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.638 --> 00:17:58.079]  Available at Amazon Books.

[00:20:03.377 --> 00:20:24.193]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.193 --> 00:20:27.676]  I gotta tell you, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:20:27.676 --> 00:20:32.800]  Gavin was here in town a few months ago and he was really down and he was taking calls from his wife who
[00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:36.841]  He didn't say it was off record.
[00:20:36.841 --> 00:20:41.187]  Maybe that means, basically, well, let's just say she was in trouble.
[00:20:41.187 --> 00:20:45.153]  Neighbors threatening them, harassing their kids, everything else, and...
[00:20:48.297 --> 00:20:56.979]  He was depressed, but now to see him back on the offense is really an awesome thing, because I've been looking at groups, and we're looking at Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:20:56.979 --> 00:20:59.659]  We had lawyers here last week three times.
[00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:01.219]  Very prominent ones.
[00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:04.140]  And we have all these powerful suits to get them off our backs.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.101]  It's just which one's the best.
[00:21:07.101 --> 00:21:14.062]  There's a famous author who's English, who said a bunch of horrible stuff about me yesterday, who I can tell you right now is the prime target.
[00:21:15.014 --> 00:21:24.679]  He said, I'm sending people currently to kill parents of Parkland students.
[00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:33.464]  You talk about dangerous as hell to have a prominent author and actor on YouTube saying, we must take Jones down.
[00:21:33.464 --> 00:21:37.146]  He must not be tolerated showing flaming swastikas while he says it.
[00:21:39.366 --> 00:21:40.887]  And he shows no proof!
[00:21:40.887 --> 00:21:42.249]  But it's like, well, that's a famous actor.
[00:21:42.249 --> 00:21:43.610]  I'm gonna get to it later.
[00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.412]  So I couldn't sleep last night.
[00:21:45.412 --> 00:21:46.453]  I woke up at like 3 a.m.
[00:21:46.453 --> 00:21:50.997]  I texted my lawyer and I said, I think this is patient zero for us.
[00:21:50.997 --> 00:21:54.000]  But then I'm in my email inbox.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.261]  Hey, here's your email.
[00:21:55.261 --> 00:21:57.123]  Don't go with this till 8 a.m.
[00:21:57.123 --> 00:21:59.025]  We're going to file suit tomorrow.
[00:21:59.025 --> 00:22:01.086]  So I'm glad to have Gavin McInnes here with us.
[00:22:02.025 --> 00:22:03.346]  Again, founder of Vice.
[00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:04.688]  They took it over and ruined it.
[00:22:04.688 --> 00:22:06.930]  There's so many other big things.
[00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.755]  And he's having to fight back because they ruined his life.
[00:22:10.755 --> 00:22:12.096]  They took his bank accounts away.
[00:22:12.096 --> 00:22:13.458]  They took his PayPal away.
[00:22:13.458 --> 00:22:16.461]  He got fired from CRTV where he was number one.
[00:22:16.461 --> 00:22:18.283]  Another reason he got fired.
[00:22:18.283 --> 00:22:20.425]  Yeah, you think you get promoted when you're number one.
[00:22:20.425 --> 00:22:21.126]  No.
[00:22:21.126 --> 00:22:23.349]  Not when there's other guys above you that are older.
[00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.911]  You get fired.
[00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:26.992]  That's how the world really works.
[00:22:26.992 --> 00:22:30.995]  You're the top race car driver or the top fighter until you've cemented yourself forever.
[00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:32.276]  There's people gunning for you.
[00:22:32.276 --> 00:22:38.381]  So Gavin, in the six, seven minutes we have left, get into again why you're doing this, the press conference that's coming up.
[00:22:38.381 --> 00:22:40.102]  But first, you got interrupted by the break.
[00:22:40.102 --> 00:22:51.551]  You were bringing up the parallels to the Kentucky Catholic school students who got totally set up, totally demonized, and called Nazis for standing their ground.
[00:22:51.551 --> 00:22:52.072]  Just incredible.
[00:22:53.413 --> 00:22:55.496]  Yeah, and that was an actual quote.
[00:22:55.496 --> 00:23:05.932]  I watched CNN that morning and they said, this is a quote, the woman interviewing one of the boys said, isn't it kind of aggressive standing your ground?
[00:23:06.838 --> 00:23:09.979]  And I was just floored by that question.
[00:23:09.979 --> 00:23:23.025]  The fact that standing up for yourself is now considered aggressive, the fact that not bowing your head in shame and just being submissive is now considered aggressive shows where we are as a country.
[00:23:23.025 --> 00:23:30.649]  We have to be drenched in shame at all times and apologize constantly or we're being aggressive.
[00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.789]  No.
[00:23:31.329 --> 00:23:32.550]  We're not being aggressive.
[00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:33.771]  We're telling the truth.
[00:23:33.771 --> 00:23:35.452]  We're being honest about who we are.
[00:23:35.452 --> 00:23:36.153]  We're not bigots.
[00:23:36.153 --> 00:23:37.034]  We're not transphobes.
[00:23:37.034 --> 00:23:37.714]  We're not homophobes.
[00:23:37.714 --> 00:23:39.315]  We're not blah blah blah of folk.
[00:23:39.315 --> 00:23:42.178]  We don't disrupt Indigenous ceremonies.
[00:23:42.178 --> 00:23:44.019]  That is all a lie.
[00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:46.941]  And I think it's time that we started fighting back.
[00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:49.723]  Your first instinct when all this happens is, I'm just going to get out of the way.
[00:23:49.723 --> 00:23:50.504]  These people are nuts.
[00:23:50.504 --> 00:23:56.729]  You know, say a crazy ex-girlfriend was outside your house throwing bricks at your house and screaming, you still love me!
[00:23:56.729 --> 00:23:58.230]  You'd be like, I need to get away from her.
[00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:00.310]  No, well, I've had enough of that.
[00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.751]  I've had enough of hiding from the crazy ex-girlfriend.
[00:24:02.751 --> 00:24:14.494]  The left has got Trump Derangement Syndrome to the point of extreme mental illness and we have to stand up to this crazy bitch and say, calm down, you lunatic!
[00:24:14.494 --> 00:24:16.555]  I'm not letting you ruin my life.
[00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:19.419]  How is your wife feeling?
[00:24:19.419 --> 00:24:36.287]  I don't want to say things on air I shouldn't but I mean you really should describe to people you almost had to get back on a plane and go home a lot of I mean this has been life-wrecking for you you're not just because the media is already oh poor Gavin oh you just lost your job everything else big deal you Nazi what's it been like for your wife?
[00:24:37.856 --> 00:24:39.037]  She turned a corner.
[00:24:39.037 --> 00:24:40.397]  I mean, she's a Hillary supporter.
[00:24:40.397 --> 00:24:41.377]  She's a Democrat.
[00:24:41.377 --> 00:24:42.898]  She's a vegan.
[00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:46.760]  And I think she realized that her people are insane.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.701]  Now, she's not a Republican, but I think she's at least going to be independent.
[00:24:50.701 --> 00:24:52.922]  She sort of, she was beaten, beaten.
[00:24:52.922 --> 00:24:57.424]  They had her, you know, hysterical and crying in bed all day.
[00:24:57.424 --> 00:25:06.348]  And then I think she sort of reached a tipping point where she said, this isn't just, and my husband's not an evil Nazi.
[00:25:06.348 --> 00:25:06.988]  F these people.
[00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:17.102]  And she sort of got an extra layer of skin, and now, you know, behind every great man is a great woman, and my woman is fully on board.
[00:25:17.102 --> 00:25:28.684]  Well, I was reading about the last two months, you guys reached out, you wrote letters, you went and knocked on people's doors with your children, and that turns into you're harassing the neighbors that stick signs in your yard saying you're a Nazi.
[00:25:28.684 --> 00:25:31.045]  I mean, these people are out-of-control drama queen liars.
[00:25:32.443 --> 00:25:34.285]  Yes, it's a small percentage.
[00:25:34.285 --> 00:25:42.734]  95% of people in the Burbs, anywhere you go, in any community, just want their kids to be happy, their kids to be educated, their kids to be healthy.
[00:25:42.734 --> 00:25:48.420]  But this 5%, these shrill limousine liberals who think they're fighting the good fight because they have a bumper sticker,
[00:25:49.216 --> 00:25:54.620]  Are very effective when it comes to domestic terror, and they really can.
[00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:56.941]  They really can harass your family.
[00:25:56.941 --> 00:25:59.423]  You know, this is how they won the Boer War.
[00:25:59.423 --> 00:26:05.387]  The English, they started terrorizing the women and children, and that's what took the soldiers down.
[00:26:05.387 --> 00:26:10.810]  And the far left, they are doubling down for the next two years.
[00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:11.871]  They're so determined.
[00:26:12.403 --> 00:26:17.407]  To make America look racist so they can get Trump out of office, that they'll stop at anything.
[00:26:17.407 --> 00:26:21.650]  And they're lying to themselves, first of all, pretending there's racists everywhere.
[00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:35.761]  Well, let's talk about in closing here, and we'll obviously get you back in the next few days, because like you said, you've been out of commission getting the suit ready, but now you're ready to come out politically guns-a-blazing, or out of the shoot like a bat out of hell here, thank God.
[00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:38.143]  And again, we're all admiring what you're doing again.
[00:26:39.424 --> 00:26:41.826]  Everybody needs to get involved and support what you're doing.
[00:26:41.826 --> 00:26:43.027]  How do people do that?
[00:26:43.027 --> 00:26:47.111]  And let's talk about the suit itself, which is linked up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:47.111 --> 00:26:51.715]  It's also up on your site, DefendGavin.com, because you've got a pretty good suit here.
[00:26:51.715 --> 00:26:58.842]  They're saying they want to destroy you, they're lying about you, and they got you fired and took you off everywhere and then brag about it for fundraisers.
[00:26:58.842 --> 00:27:02.866]  I mean, these people are the definition of what the Nazis did.
[00:27:04.218 --> 00:27:07.522]  Well, the crazy thing about all this is they want to replace the courts.
[00:27:07.522 --> 00:27:09.384]  They want to replace the justice system.
[00:27:09.384 --> 00:27:11.587]  They want to become judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:27:11.587 --> 00:27:13.689]  And you go, okay, I understand that.
[00:27:13.689 --> 00:27:16.913]  But I assume you're going to be very judicial about the way you speak and everything.
[00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:24.292]  Yet, at the same time, they have this snarky babysitter tone, where they have headlines like, you want bigots, Gavin?
[00:27:24.292 --> 00:27:26.392]  This is how you get bigots.
[00:27:26.392 --> 00:27:29.874]  So it's like Becky is running the SPLC.
[00:27:29.874 --> 00:27:31.594]  So they're destroying people's lives.
[00:27:31.594 --> 00:27:33.255]  They're destroying businesses.
[00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:34.936]  They're ruining careers.
[00:27:34.936 --> 00:27:39.217]  And the face of the company is just this snarky mean girl from high school.
[00:27:39.217 --> 00:27:45.920]  It's bizarre that we've given Becky this immense power to crush people's lives based on lies.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.342]  It's unprecedented in history, really.
[00:27:50.342 --> 00:27:52.862]  Wait till I tell you what I discovered about Joe Rogan.
[00:27:52.862 --> 00:28:00.005]  He is actively in Google, in Twitter, with them, works for them, gets money from them, doesn't tell people.
[00:28:00.005 --> 00:28:09.589]  During interviews, he's doing infomercials with Jack Dorsey, and they've got a whole rollout censorship plan that he is now captaining, and anyone that criticizes him is being deleted off YouTube.
[00:28:09.589 --> 00:28:12.590]  So Joe Rogan has literally knelt to Emperor Palpatine.
[00:28:13.929 --> 00:28:14.749]  Wow!
[00:28:14.749 --> 00:28:15.850]  I didn't know anything about that.
[00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:16.950]  That's amazing.
[00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.371]  You know, this is what happens in this culture of fear.
[00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:23.292]  You have people who they go, I don't want to get in trouble.
[00:28:23.292 --> 00:28:24.572]  I don't want to get fired.
[00:28:24.572 --> 00:28:26.152]  So I'll acquiesce.
[00:28:26.152 --> 00:28:28.593]  No, the solution is not to acquiesce.
[00:28:28.593 --> 00:28:31.174]  The solution is to fight back.
[00:28:31.174 --> 00:28:36.235]  If you were in Salem and everyone was being accused of being a witch, you don't say, look, I'm not a witch.
[00:28:36.235 --> 00:28:37.375]  I'm going to wear white.
[00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:39.356]  I don't do any witch stuff.
[00:28:39.356 --> 00:28:43.257]  No, you have to say there's no such thing as a witch and you have to fight back.
[00:28:43.857 --> 00:28:46.300]  You don't hide when someone gets burned at the stake.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.183]  You put out the fire and say, that's not a witch!
[00:28:49.183 --> 00:28:50.724]  Well done, Gavin.
[00:28:50.724 --> 00:28:52.747]  The Press Conference is coming up in like 30 minutes.
[00:28:52.747 --> 00:28:56.370]  We'll be covering it live at InfoWars.com and DefendGavin.com.
[00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:57.091]  Thank you so much, sir.
[00:28:59.306 --> 00:29:00.887]  I weighed 329 pounds.
[00:29:00.887 --> 00:29:02.347]  I was a heart attack waiting to happen.
[00:29:02.347 --> 00:29:03.628]  I got Andro 400.
[00:29:03.628 --> 00:29:04.948]  It makes me not so hungry.
[00:29:04.948 --> 00:29:06.609]  I started noticing more energy.
[00:29:06.609 --> 00:29:09.050]  I noticed my belly was starting to shrink up.
[00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.310]  I started seeing weight come off.
[00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.470]  80-some pounds.
[00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.531]  I went from 330 to 245.
[00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:17.152]  For a 56-year-old guy to lose that much weight, it took something, brother.
[00:29:17.152 --> 00:29:17.953]  I feel great.
[00:29:17.953 --> 00:29:20.314]  I feel like I was when I was 35 years old.
[00:29:20.314 --> 00:29:21.314]  That was Ruben.
[00:29:21.314 --> 00:29:23.535]  Now listen to what Josh says about Andro 400.
[00:29:24.335 --> 00:29:26.236]  Well, I'll tell you, man, that stuff really works.
[00:29:26.236 --> 00:29:27.176]  It was insane.
[00:29:27.176 --> 00:29:28.817]  I've heard the commercials, what, for a decade?
[00:29:28.817 --> 00:29:30.357]  I was like, yeah, I'm just gonna try it.
[00:29:30.357 --> 00:29:31.898]  My pants are, like, falling off.
[00:29:31.898 --> 00:29:32.698]  It really works.
[00:29:32.698 --> 00:29:36.339]  I bought suits last year for my new job, and they're falling off of me.
[00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:37.099]  It's insane.
[00:29:37.099 --> 00:29:47.423]  Guys, if you want to lose belly fat, gain energy, strength, and muscle, and look and feel years younger, try Andro 400, the safe, natural, and affordable way to boost your testosterone.
[00:29:47.543 --> 00:29:48.946]  Go to Andro400.com or call 888-400-0435.
[00:29:48.946 --> 00:29:49.426]  That's 888-400-0435.
[00:29:49.426 --> 00:29:50.168]  Andro400.com.
[00:30:09.656 --> 00:30:18.619]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:30:18.619 --> 00:30:28.743]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:30:28.743 --> 00:30:37.287]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:30:38.107 --> 00:30:39.447]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:30:39.447 --> 00:30:40.608]  You must experience it.
[00:30:40.608 --> 00:30:42.588]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:30:42.588 --> 00:30:47.609]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:30:47.609 --> 00:30:49.130]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.610]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:57.292]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:30:57.292 --> 00:30:58.792]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[00:31:00.282 --> 00:31:02.524]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:31:02.524 --> 00:31:04.265]  There is no set stasis.
[00:31:04.265 --> 00:31:05.506]  There is no managed system.
[00:31:05.506 --> 00:31:07.167]  There is no un-continuum.
[00:31:07.167 --> 00:31:10.389]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:13.751]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:14.992]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[00:31:14.992 --> 00:31:15.753]  We'll be here forever.
[00:31:15.753 --> 00:31:17.034]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:31:17.034 --> 00:31:23.918]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:31:23.918 --> 00:31:24.479]  We made it.
[00:31:24.479 --> 00:31:26.660]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.462]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[00:31:28.462 --> 00:31:28.822]  And so,
[00:31:29.042 --> 00:31:35.486]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:31:35.486 --> 00:31:40.549]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:43.411]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:31:43.411 --> 00:31:45.812]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:31:45.812 --> 00:31:49.314]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[00:31:49.314 --> 00:31:50.335]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:31:50.595 --> 00:31:53.716]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[00:31:53.716 --> 00:31:54.876]  Not these devil worshippers.
[00:31:54.876 --> 00:31:57.737]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:31:57.737 --> 00:31:58.817]  I want life.
[00:31:58.817 --> 00:32:00.138]  I want Jesus.
[00:32:00.138 --> 00:32:06.359]  Wars are like 12 round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:12.281]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[00:32:12.281 --> 00:32:13.881]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[00:32:13.881 --> 00:32:14.381]  We stopped her.
[00:32:14.381 --> 00:32:16.562]  We got a nationalist in.
[00:32:16.562 --> 00:32:18.763]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[00:32:18.763 --> 00:32:19.683]  We are winning.
[00:32:20.538 --> 00:32:26.028]  But those of us who are at the very front line of the tip of the spear are under unprecedented attack.
[00:32:26.028 --> 00:32:31.137]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[00:32:31.137 --> 00:32:32.259]  This is about who wants it most.
[00:32:33.675 --> 00:32:37.218]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors they've taken, everything.
[00:32:37.218 --> 00:32:39.359]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:42.562]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[00:32:42.562 --> 00:32:43.683]  It's that simple.
[00:32:43.683 --> 00:32:45.124]  Thousands of great products.
[00:32:45.124 --> 00:32:51.228]  Whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InfoWareShore.com.
[00:32:51.228 --> 00:32:59.355]  So please, go to InfoWareShore.com today, look at all the great products, because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands, and your support is beyond critical.
[00:32:59.355 --> 00:32:59.655]  Thank you.
[00:33:03.385 --> 00:33:14.337]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.337 --> 00:33:19.382]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:35.911 --> 00:33:37.772]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:33:37.772 --> 00:33:44.155]  And you know, I've really been soul-searching about how honest I should be with the audience.
[00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:47.736]  I want to be clear.
[00:33:47.736 --> 00:33:50.057]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too!
[00:33:50.057 --> 00:33:51.898]  Your fire musket, but I'll run you through.
[00:33:51.898 --> 00:33:53.899]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:33:53.899 --> 00:33:56.620]  So when you're waiting for the next attack... Crank it up!
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.121]  You better stand.
[00:33:58.121 --> 00:33:59.442]  I'm turning back.
[00:33:59.442 --> 00:34:01.803]  The bugle sounds, the charge begins!
[00:34:05.799 --> 00:34:08.141]  Alright, getting back to what I was saying.
[00:34:08.141 --> 00:34:13.565]  I am neurotically honest about everything I do on air.
[00:34:13.565 --> 00:34:18.469]  In fact, if I feel like saying something kind of nasty, I say it, even though I shouldn't.
[00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:27.856]  It's a family show, and I committed this morning to not every once in a while say nasty, mean,
[00:34:29.019 --> 00:34:30.079]  Unprofessional things.
[00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:33.641]  And I got on my knees this morning and I said, God, at like 3 a.m.
[00:34:33.641 --> 00:34:36.862]  I couldn't sleep because I was feeling bad about some of the things I said on the show last week.
[00:34:36.862 --> 00:34:38.443]  They weren't that bad compared to the rest.
[00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:38.883]  You know what?
[00:34:38.883 --> 00:34:40.804]  I can't be like those people.
[00:34:40.804 --> 00:34:42.645]  But anyways, that's another side issue.
[00:34:42.645 --> 00:34:44.485]  I start thinking about telling the truth.
[00:34:44.485 --> 00:34:46.426]  I tell you about my own personal struggles.
[00:34:46.426 --> 00:34:50.248]  So you understand that I'm trying to commit to you to be as good as I can.
[00:34:50.248 --> 00:34:53.049]  But I get whacked out fighting the globalist.
[00:34:54.073 --> 00:34:56.214]  Where I don't care what they do to me?
[00:34:56.214 --> 00:35:00.636]  So then psychological governors are taken off, where I'm not compartmentalized.
[00:35:00.636 --> 00:35:03.078]  I'm wide open, okay?
[00:35:03.078 --> 00:35:11.942]  And you kind of go crazy when you're staring into the abyss all day is what I'm trying to say.
[00:35:11.942 --> 00:35:14.264]  And again, these are a lot of emotions.
[00:35:14.264 --> 00:35:16.265]  It's hard to even describe what I'm trying to get out of here.
[00:35:16.265 --> 00:35:16.705]  It's just...
[00:35:19.525 --> 00:35:22.867]  I get wild on air sometimes, and I don't do it on purpose.
[00:35:22.867 --> 00:35:24.768]  And some of it's good, and some of it's bad.
[00:35:24.768 --> 00:35:35.534]  And I understand the world's such a serious place that I need to rein it in at 45 years old and be more professional because things are very serious.
[00:35:35.534 --> 00:35:40.997]  But at the same time, my information's accurate, but I have gone kind of crazy.
[00:35:42.585 --> 00:35:44.805]  I mean, that just goes with the territory.
[00:35:44.805 --> 00:35:56.588]  When you start getting persecuted for many, many years on end, and you go through a lot of persecution, and you make yourself adapt to it and overcome it, it's like that Gnarls Barkley song.
[00:35:56.588 --> 00:35:58.828]  I don't know how to describe it.
[00:35:58.828 --> 00:36:08.010]  But he talks about, once he went crazy, he had so much more emotion and also so much space.
[00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:08.870]  And that's what it's like.
[00:36:10.538 --> 00:36:29.963]  When you go past these barriers and do things other people haven't done, and you conquer these demons, thanks to God's help, at the same time, every time you conquer a demon with God's help, you're still a man and you take a little piece of that bugger along with you.
[00:36:29.963 --> 00:36:35.345]  And I've prayed to God to cleanse me and help me not be like this, because
[00:36:37.495 --> 00:36:42.978]  If I get the diabolical mindset... This morning I was working out with Pat Riley, my buddy.
[00:36:42.978 --> 00:36:45.759]  And I said, now watch this, Pat.
[00:36:45.759 --> 00:36:52.002]  I'm gonna try to throw at like three times the range at that dartboard from a regular position.
[00:36:52.002 --> 00:36:53.683]  And I hit the dartboard, but barely.
[00:36:53.683 --> 00:36:55.203]  And I said, now I'm gonna turn over to evil.
[00:36:55.203 --> 00:36:56.584]  Watch this.
[00:36:56.584 --> 00:36:58.585]  Double bullseye and right by the bullseye.
[00:36:59.437 --> 00:37:00.777]  I gave in to hate.
[00:37:00.777 --> 00:37:03.178]  I just hated my enemies.
[00:37:03.178 --> 00:37:06.118]  And it's like, that's the dark side, folks.
[00:37:06.118 --> 00:37:08.018]  And I just like, I don't know how to explain it.
[00:37:08.018 --> 00:37:11.139]  Because this is all just seething and ready to get these people.
[00:37:11.139 --> 00:37:12.939]  Because they think they've got the dark side.
[00:37:12.939 --> 00:37:15.220]  They have no idea.
[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.420]  And I just, and Riley was like, that was amazing.
[00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.020]  He saw it happen.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:23.341]  And I just don't know how to explain it.
[00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.781]  It's just, oh my God.
[00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:28.602]  Just thank you for putting up with me is all I'm saying.
[00:37:29.878 --> 00:37:30.838]  And then I'll add this.
[00:37:30.838 --> 00:37:32.399]  You know, we're here supporting Roger Stone.
[00:37:32.399 --> 00:37:35.481]  We're here supporting Gavin McInnes, who's an awesome guy and I admire.
[00:37:35.481 --> 00:37:36.601]  And you're supporting me.
[00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:39.863]  So I don't like coming up here and asking for your support all the time.
[00:37:39.863 --> 00:37:40.463]  But you know what?
[00:37:40.463 --> 00:37:43.325]  I'm in a total war.
[00:37:43.325 --> 00:37:49.008]  And quite frankly, back in the day we could bring in plenty of money before all the censorship and blocking.
[00:37:49.008 --> 00:37:50.408]  I barely plugged.
[00:37:50.408 --> 00:37:57.272]  And if I'd have plugged like an ant and put away stuff for the winter instead of a grasshopper, we wouldn't be nip and tuck right now.
[00:37:58.479 --> 00:38:02.644]  This is an ongoing savage war.
[00:38:02.644 --> 00:38:04.086]  They took away almost all our sponsors.
[00:38:04.086 --> 00:38:08.491]  They took away our ability to advertise online on most platforms.
[00:38:08.491 --> 00:38:10.653]  They took most our banking away.
[00:38:10.653 --> 00:38:13.056]  They financed all these fake lawsuits against me.
[00:38:13.056 --> 00:38:15.098]  I got most of them thrown out.
[00:38:15.098 --> 00:38:16.941]  Same people filed more!
[00:38:20.759 --> 00:38:36.876]  But here's the thing, I know we can't give up because we've got a job to do into this fight, into the crises that the globalists are starting.
[00:38:36.876 --> 00:38:40.060]  And we have to be in the position into the future.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.783]  The enemy has done the analysis and they know
[00:38:43.834 --> 00:38:55.119]  That if we continue into the future, they know on the timelines they've tracked, InfoWars is a critical chain reaction component to planetary victory for humanity.
[00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:56.100]  They know that.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:09.526]  And so we have to step into that admission, and step into that office, and step into that responsibility, myself included, and you've got my commitment to do the best I can under this level of pressure.
[00:39:09.526 --> 00:39:12.748]  The problem is, it's not that the pressure grinds me down,
[00:39:13.973 --> 00:39:19.177]  The pressure, when I overcome it, then I become a monster.
[00:39:19.177 --> 00:39:19.637]  You understand?
[00:39:19.637 --> 00:39:24.860]  I'm fighting, not accessing worldly powers, is what I'm trying to say.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.083]  Because I can't use the devil's tricks.
[00:39:28.083 --> 00:39:32.966]  I'm trying to be a very good person, and I'm not trying to give in to the dark side, you understand?
[00:39:32.966 --> 00:39:38.770]  But as they put more pressure on me, it's beyond a temptation.
[00:39:40.397 --> 00:39:42.459]  I start seething.
[00:39:42.459 --> 00:39:43.759]  So just pray for me.
[00:39:43.759 --> 00:40:00.851]  And I'm not whining, I'm asking for financial support, and I'm sure asking for prayers, folks, because... You want to take care of people you love, you want to be a good person, you want to beat evil, but you cannot become it in the process.
[00:40:00.851 --> 00:40:07.015]  That's how so many good men and women fell to evil, fell to darkness, was in the process of trying to beat it, they became it.
[00:40:07.015 --> 00:40:07.956]  I do not want to do that.
[00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:14.155]  But I'm prone to it, and I'm just, I'm struggling.
[00:40:14.155 --> 00:40:18.638]  Because again, instead of feeling weak like a victim, it does the opposite.
[00:40:18.638 --> 00:40:25.203]  But it's worse than being a victim, because I don't want to become what the enemy wishes they were, is what I'm trying to say.
[00:40:25.203 --> 00:40:30.307]  I don't think I've explained that, but I'm just, you've got my commitment to the best job I can.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.701]  Our biggest stress is production time.
[00:40:35.701 --> 00:40:39.002]  If I go out and shoot an ad in an interesting location, we sell product.
[00:40:39.002 --> 00:40:40.783]  If I make the ad interesting, we sell product.
[00:40:40.783 --> 00:40:47.766]  If I just sit here in the studio going, please buy my product, please buy my product, you don't buy the products, and then I've got to run even more ads to try to bring the money in.
[00:40:47.766 --> 00:40:50.247]  All of you that have been supporting us, I want to thank you.
[00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:51.667]  Support the local radio stations as well.
[00:40:51.667 --> 00:40:52.728]  They're just as important.
[00:40:52.728 --> 00:40:53.488]  Local TV as well.
[00:40:54.445 --> 00:40:59.209]  But these are products everybody should have their children on clean, high-quality fish oil.
[00:40:59.209 --> 00:41:00.690]  Ours is the best on a roll.
[00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.513]  Everybody should be taking high-quality turmeric.
[00:41:03.513 --> 00:41:06.215]  Body's is the best out there, period.
[00:41:06.215 --> 00:41:13.081]  You have my commitment on my soul that we went out and got the best company, the best quality, and 9 or 5% cumanoid.
[00:41:13.081 --> 00:41:13.941]  Nobody else has got it.
[00:41:14.662 --> 00:41:20.264]  That's what I'm getting at here is, everybody else likes to lie, everybody else sits there and gives you bull.
[00:41:20.264 --> 00:41:22.284]  It's like the spirit of these people.
[00:41:22.284 --> 00:41:23.585]  We're not doing that.
[00:41:23.585 --> 00:41:27.846]  When I tell you our stuff's got the most product in it, it's got the most product in it.
[00:41:27.846 --> 00:41:31.927]  When I tell you our bone broth's the strongest or the best, it is!
[00:41:31.927 --> 00:41:33.488]  You're like, well it doesn't taste too good.
[00:41:33.488 --> 00:41:42.090]  What do you think pure bone broth with the highest quality chaga mushroom and bee pollen tastes like?
[00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:43.271]  There's no fillers in this!
[00:41:44.383 --> 00:41:45.504]  Gotta mix it with other stuff.
[00:41:45.504 --> 00:41:49.186]  It's nitro for the body.
[00:41:49.186 --> 00:41:50.687]  It's $19.95 right now.
[00:41:50.687 --> 00:41:51.527]  That's our new special.
[00:41:51.527 --> 00:41:52.368]  Got a big shipment in.
[00:41:52.368 --> 00:41:56.650]  I want you to see how great it is for your bones, your cartilage, your body.
[00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:57.471]  Meal replacement.
[00:41:57.471 --> 00:41:58.551]  Mix it with whey.
[00:41:58.551 --> 00:41:59.312]  Mix it with milk.
[00:41:59.312 --> 00:42:00.192]  Mix it with fruit.
[00:42:00.192 --> 00:42:01.413]  Then it tastes pretty good.
[00:42:01.413 --> 00:42:05.815]  The point is, it's... We don't even... We can't even quantify.
[00:42:05.815 --> 00:42:09.037]  It's like 15 bowls of chicken noodle soup without the calories?
[00:42:09.037 --> 00:42:11.639]  I mean, it's probably more than that.
[00:42:11.639 --> 00:42:11.879]  Okay?
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:15.442]  It's the strongest.
[00:42:15.442 --> 00:42:17.164]  And Vice and all of them make fun of it all day.
[00:42:17.164 --> 00:42:18.366]  They're idiots.
[00:42:18.366 --> 00:42:19.467]  They're pathetic slaves.
[00:42:19.467 --> 00:42:20.348]  Look at them!
[00:42:20.348 --> 00:42:23.992]  The enemy can't even get real people on his side.
[00:42:23.992 --> 00:42:27.535]  So, we got a bunch of new specials at Infowarslife.com.

[00:47:29.348 --> 00:47:38.254]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:38.254 --> 00:47:41.576]  We're on the march, the empire is on the run.
[00:47:41.576 --> 00:47:44.298]  Alright.
[00:47:44.298 --> 00:47:46.480]  I don't like doing what I've got to do next hour.
[00:47:48.357 --> 00:47:59.361]  But I have discovered that Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan are doing such horribly evil things to people that I'm ashamed of myself for not learning about it earlier.
[00:47:59.361 --> 00:48:12.365]  Now quite frankly, in fairness, I mean we're covering the big global issues and what's happening and what's unfolding, but hiding in plain view under my nose
[00:48:15.683 --> 00:48:38.025]  is a stinking rat's nest that deals with the internet takeover plans, face scanning to buy and sell, potential SEC violations where they're promoting different cryptocurrencies but not telling you they're being paid to do it.
[00:48:38.025 --> 00:48:38.706]  I mean you just saw
[00:48:39.935 --> 00:48:44.397]  A bunch of Floyd Mayweather and a bunch of others paid big fines over that.
[00:48:44.397 --> 00:48:55.042]  And when I learned about this sort of researching it, there was Jack Darcy of Twitter
[00:48:56.164 --> 00:49:02.265]  Talking about it with Joe going, oh and I've met with the SEC and we're being very careful how we do this.
[00:49:02.265 --> 00:49:05.186]  He's such a snake.
[00:49:05.186 --> 00:49:07.606]  Oh, looking down while he says it.
[00:49:07.606 --> 00:49:21.809]  And they're not telling you he pays Joe millions of dollars to push particular cryptocurrencies and different cashless systems for a global government currency that they think Joe is the answer.
[00:49:21.809 --> 00:49:23.249]  How pathetic!
[00:49:25.562 --> 00:49:30.465]  50,000 downvotes to 7,000 downvotes.
[00:49:30.465 --> 00:49:46.833]  So... All I can say is, in the words of Tony Montana, for a green card, I'm gonna carve him up real good.
[00:49:46.833 --> 00:49:51.215]  Politically.
[00:49:51.215 --> 00:49:53.456]  Because watching this is so...
[00:49:55.856 --> 00:49:59.838]  To watch Joe prey on his viewers.
[00:49:59.838 --> 00:50:06.762]  And now I've got his whole... his whole modus operandi.
[00:50:06.762 --> 00:50:10.225]  What a snake, man.
[00:50:10.225 --> 00:50:14.007]  You know, people can take, like, that snake-like behavior as manly.
[00:50:14.007 --> 00:50:14.947]  It's not.
[00:50:14.947 --> 00:50:24.153]  It's a predator with eyes pointed straight forward, looking right at you, how he can game you and dominate you and control you.
[00:50:24.153 --> 00:50:24.453]  Period.
[00:50:25.814 --> 00:50:28.335]  Joe Rogan is definitely a psychopath.
[00:50:28.335 --> 00:50:29.796]  And so is Jack Dorsey.
[00:50:29.796 --> 00:50:34.018]  So they're two disgusting little peas in a fetid pod.
[00:50:34.018 --> 00:50:38.800]  They can make our mannerisms and they can behave like we are, but they are the traitor within.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.281]  They are the plague, to quote Cicero.
[00:50:41.281 --> 00:50:45.163]  So wait till I expose this.
[00:50:45.163 --> 00:50:48.564]  This is just one sponsor, we believe is biggest.
[00:50:48.564 --> 00:50:49.945]  Word is $300,000 a month, Rogan's been getting for years.
[00:50:52.746 --> 00:50:58.552]  Never telling people that his main sponsor is Jack Dorsey.
[00:50:58.552 --> 00:51:03.357]  Unbelievable.
[00:51:03.357 --> 00:51:06.360]  All hiding in plain view.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:15.169]  You know, I gotta thank the listeners for being all over my ass the last few years about Joe.
[00:51:16.061 --> 00:51:19.484]  And I just didn't listen to it, because I'm too busy to listen to two hour long deals.
[00:51:19.484 --> 00:51:21.646]  You know, I'm doing my own research.
[00:51:21.646 --> 00:51:27.691]  And you know, usually it's like, DMT, we, you know, all this George Soros type stuff.
[00:51:27.691 --> 00:51:28.772]  That's all an agenda.
[00:51:28.772 --> 00:51:33.056]  That's been his sponsor, is these big foundations.
[00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:42.945]  And now it's making Jack Dorsey's digital system based on Bitcoin, the new global currency, when obviously they brought the global currency forward,
[00:51:44.355 --> 00:51:53.538]  As a grassroots thing to make you adopt it like it's avant-garde and radical and cashless and blockchain and it's so radical it tracks money's whole history.
[00:51:53.538 --> 00:51:54.078]  Oh great!
[00:51:54.078 --> 00:51:56.679]  A total tracking of money throughout its history.
[00:51:56.679 --> 00:51:57.920]  The opposite of cash.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:00.060]  How wonderful is this?
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:03.121]  It's wunderbar!
[00:52:03.121 --> 00:52:05.222]  And Joe the whole time is looking down at his notes.
[00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:08.123]  It's all stuff written by Twitter.
[00:52:10.283 --> 00:52:13.807]  Oh, I love your... I just... Oh, that company of yours.
[00:52:13.807 --> 00:52:14.507]  What's the name?
[00:52:14.507 --> 00:52:15.428]  It's so good.
[00:52:15.428 --> 00:52:16.089]  It's so easy.
[00:52:16.089 --> 00:52:16.769]  We all use it.
[00:52:16.769 --> 00:52:18.010]  What's the name?
[00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:24.957]  Not even saying... By the way, my biggest sponsor's here, Jack Dorsey, and I'm here to do a pump and dump.
[00:52:24.957 --> 00:52:26.899]  I'm sorry, I said I'd get to it next hour.
[00:52:26.899 --> 00:52:30.482]  It's just the sliminess of it.
[00:52:30.482 --> 00:52:31.063]  God!
[00:52:35.501 --> 00:52:42.008]  That's why Joe Rogan loves Vegas so much, because it's one thing to go to Vegas every once in a while, but it's one thing to be a creature of it.
[00:52:42.008 --> 00:52:42.749]  And to like it.
[00:52:42.749 --> 00:52:44.951]  Because I get into L.A.
[00:52:44.951 --> 00:52:48.155]  or Vegas and I'm like, I don't have a soul here.
[00:52:48.155 --> 00:52:50.517]  Something's wrong getting me out of here.
[00:52:50.517 --> 00:52:52.399]  Danger, Will Robinson, danger.
[00:52:52.399 --> 00:52:54.281]  I can't sleep in those cities.
[00:52:54.281 --> 00:52:56.043]  I can't have fun in those cities.
[00:52:56.043 --> 00:52:57.205]  Because they're evil!
[00:53:01.032 --> 00:53:03.033]  New York City's got corruption, but I feel good there.
[00:53:03.033 --> 00:53:05.655]  It's different people and things going on.
[00:53:05.655 --> 00:53:07.396]  But L.A.
[00:53:07.396 --> 00:53:14.001]  and Vegas are mu-oh, mu-ee Diablo.
[00:53:14.001 --> 00:53:17.483]  All right, I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:53:17.483 --> 00:53:26.689]  I just, you literally, the old saying was, why did the sun never set on the English Empire, or the British Empire?
[00:53:26.689 --> 00:53:29.191]  And that's because God wouldn't trust an Englishman in the dark.
[00:53:30.849 --> 00:53:37.712]  That was the old saying that, you know, scratch a pirate, find an Englishman.
[00:53:37.712 --> 00:53:40.953]  Was the old saying.
[00:53:40.953 --> 00:53:46.935]  And, you, you, you, I mean, you pull back from this.
[00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.487]  And it's so diabolical.
[00:53:50.487 --> 00:53:53.529]  See, I woke up at like 2.33 in the morning to go back to sleep.
[00:53:53.529 --> 00:54:04.598]  So I got in front of the computer, the big screen computer, and I was like, well, I know, sorry, my brain already prime projected, already had enough data points, but I was like, let me guess.
[00:54:05.649 --> 00:54:07.531]  Jack Dorsey's been in Bitcoin a long time.
[00:54:07.531 --> 00:54:10.873]  Let me guess, I bet he dumped his right when it went down.
[00:54:10.873 --> 00:54:12.755]  Sure enough, exactly what he did.
[00:54:12.755 --> 00:54:17.418]  And then, they're doing a dead cat bounce, trying to suck her in the next group.
[00:54:17.418 --> 00:54:25.184]  And so, now they're trying to suck her in Joe's audience, who they see as like stoner, you know, low-grade morons that want to learn how to be ninjas.
[00:54:25.184 --> 00:54:31.990]  And sure as hell, everything I already knew, and it wasn't a confirmation bias, it was literally like, oh, he dumped right when it dumped.
[00:54:35.333 --> 00:54:37.313]  Oh, he's doing a pump-and-dump.
[00:54:37.313 --> 00:54:49.116]  Oh, and then, oh, others... And I went, oh my God, I found last night three George Soros-owned companies that are Joe Rogan sponsors.
[00:54:49.116 --> 00:54:56.878]  But he almost never tells you it's a sponsor when they're on, like the first thing I tell you.
[00:54:57.948 --> 00:55:07.567]  Because ethically, if someone is your parent company or your sponsor, when you have them on, by the way, this is my sponsor, doesn't say that in a two hour podcast.
[00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:13.471]  I couldn't watch the whole thing, so I had a crew member this morning.
[00:55:13.471 --> 00:55:14.131]  I called at 9.
[00:55:14.131 --> 00:55:16.313]  I said, I watched an hour of it.
[00:55:16.313 --> 00:55:18.034]  And I watched parts of it multiple times.
[00:55:18.034 --> 00:55:18.714]  I can't watch it.
[00:55:18.714 --> 00:55:19.695]  It's like a snake fest.
[00:55:19.695 --> 00:55:21.756]  It's like two cobras dancing together.
[00:55:21.756 --> 00:55:23.477]  I said, can you watch this?
[00:55:23.477 --> 00:55:31.882]  And no, never said, Jack, thanks for being my sponsor these past few years and paying me hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.
[00:55:33.917 --> 00:55:39.699]  It was just like, thank goodness you're a moral CEO of never censored anyone on your platform.
[00:55:39.699 --> 00:55:41.480]  And like Joe's laughing while he says it.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:48.343]  It's all a... It's like saying to Hitler, thank God you love Jews.
[00:55:48.343 --> 00:55:54.465]  Or, you know, Fat Albert, thank God you're so skinny.
[00:55:54.465 --> 00:55:59.727]  Or to a giraffe, thank God you don't have a neck, you know.
[00:55:59.727 --> 00:56:01.968]  Or a bass, thank God you have such a small mouth.
[00:56:05.163 --> 00:56:07.725]  Oh my grandma, what big eyes you have, what big teeth.
[00:56:07.725 --> 00:56:10.467]  All the better to see you, all the better to eat you with.
[00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:12.849]  And there's Joe, man.
[00:56:12.849 --> 00:56:15.531]  Even his own logo is a devil.
[00:56:15.531 --> 00:56:19.354]  And he's just dancing around, it's all funny.
[00:56:19.354 --> 00:56:21.976]  Oh, I'm a pothead, yeah.
[00:56:21.976 --> 00:56:23.097]  You wanna be manly?
[00:56:23.097 --> 00:56:24.618]  Do it with me.
[00:56:24.618 --> 00:56:27.841]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:27.841 --> 00:56:28.902]  But the good news is...
[00:56:32.335 --> 00:56:39.341]  Joe is like the globalist prize pig or something, you know, like the prize golden calf.
[00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:45.886]  And everyone I know hates his guts.
[00:56:45.886 --> 00:56:56.594]  Even six months ago, it's like there's this genetic spiritual awakening where, I mean, you don't think anybody really likes Alexandria Cortez, right?
[00:56:56.594 --> 00:56:58.936]  That's all fake, fake stage election.
[00:56:58.936 --> 00:56:59.777]  It's the same thing everywhere.
[00:57:06.388 --> 00:57:11.711]  So, I got a bunch of other big news I'm gonna hit, but we're gonna go into the Bitcoin scam.
[00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:15.334]  And I want to be clear, I'm not saying a cryptocurrency is bad.
[00:57:15.334 --> 00:57:20.177]  I'm explaining that it came out of nowhere, no one knew, it's so avant-garde.
[00:57:20.177 --> 00:57:27.121]  I had people heavily Soros connected, now I realize that trying to get me involved years ago, I wouldn't do it.
[00:57:27.121 --> 00:57:33.385]  They would always just show up when I was in London or wherever trying to push on me, and now the whole thing is so clear.
[00:57:33.385 --> 00:57:33.705]  And so,
[00:57:35.083 --> 00:57:44.561]  Jack Dorsey with Joe Rogan thinks they can sit there and try to sucker people in to another Bitcoin bubble.
[00:57:44.561 --> 00:57:46.185]  I mean, that is diabolical!
[00:57:58.669 --> 00:58:07.631]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:58:07.631 --> 00:58:17.752]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:58:17.752 --> 00:58:26.274]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:58:27.114 --> 00:58:28.475]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:58:28.475 --> 00:58:29.636]  You must experience it.
[00:58:29.636 --> 00:58:31.598]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:58:31.598 --> 00:58:36.642]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:58:36.642 --> 00:58:38.163]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.163 --> 00:58:39.624]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:58:39.624 --> 00:58:46.329]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:58:46.329 --> 00:58:47.811]  TurboForce at m4slife.com.
[00:58:50.595 --> 00:58:58.300]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:11.649]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[00:59:11.649 --> 00:59:16.552]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:20.135]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
[00:59:20.715 --> 00:59:29.822]  We're gonna go from full price to 40% off on both of these best-selling products right now at InfoWarsLife.com and InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:59:52.768 --> 00:59:55.432]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:41.808 --> 01:00:43.549]  Alright.
[01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:45.550]  Here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:50.252]  I have a ton of really important video clips I haven't gotten to.
[01:00:50.252 --> 01:00:53.053]  And I've also committed to every day take your calls.
[01:00:54.977 --> 01:01:01.618]  But then we have like a digital phone system that can take hundreds of calls at a time, so we get like 20, 30 on the board, and I always feel bad I don't get the last five or six of you.
[01:01:01.618 --> 01:01:05.019]  So you know what the answer is, guys?
[01:01:05.019 --> 01:01:13.081]  Let's only start, unless I'm doing a whole show of calls, let's start taking like 10, and then I'll get to those for sure.
[01:01:13.081 --> 01:01:13.581]  Let's just do that.
[01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:20.482]  So we're gonna open the phones up at the bottom of the hour, into the half of the next hour, so for a full hour,
[01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:30.048]  It'll be a bifurcated hour, like the last 30 and the first 30, however you say that.
[01:01:30.048 --> 01:01:31.309]  Doesn't matter.
[01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:36.569]  We'll take your phone calls, and we will get into any issue you want, any subject, anything.
[01:01:36.569 --> 01:01:41.250]  I mean, I have so much news, I can't even cover it all.
[01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:49.812]  I'm just so blown away by how seedy the system is, and just how crazy everything is,
[01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:55.652]  And that I can't discipline myself anymore.
[01:01:55.652 --> 01:01:58.432]  Man, 15 years ago on radio, I would get a whole show lined up.
[01:01:58.432 --> 01:01:59.613]  I knew what I was going to cover.
[01:01:59.613 --> 01:02:00.493]  I'd get there and I'd do it.
[01:02:00.493 --> 01:02:06.654]  Now, I say, coming up next hour, I'm going to expose a giant Twitter scam that Jack Dorsey's running.
[01:02:06.654 --> 01:02:11.415]  And then it's like a record skipping or a car accident sound.
[01:02:11.415 --> 01:02:16.696]  I start going into it right then.
[01:02:16.696 --> 01:02:18.716]  It's kind of a good thing there's no discipline.
[01:02:20.134 --> 01:02:22.777]  Because all there is is discipline, you know what I mean?
[01:02:22.777 --> 01:02:28.202]  But, here's the problem.
[01:02:28.202 --> 01:02:43.258]  I do so much preparation and so much research that when it comes time to do it again, it's kind of like your kid had the flu, was puking and crapping all night, you took care of him.
[01:02:44.773 --> 01:02:52.576]  And you feel good, you're going to bed about 5 a.m., and maybe they're going to sleep a few hours, but you're about to describe it to everybody, and it's almost like evil to describe it.
[01:02:52.576 --> 01:02:58.659]  And you know, I kind of get the point, like, hey man, let's watch the football game and have a good time.
[01:02:58.659 --> 01:03:01.140]  Hey, let's not focus in on all the evil all day.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.121]  Hey man, how about Brady?
[01:03:03.121 --> 01:03:10.484]  Six, six Super Bowls, and the left wanted to defeat that, and they got their ass kicked, and it's archetypal, and woo, woo, woo!
[01:03:11.929 --> 01:03:14.551]  I start doing that, I'm gonna be gone forever.
[01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:16.112]  Believe me.
[01:03:16.112 --> 01:03:19.254]  I get off this bicycle, I'm gone.
[01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:26.400]  And I get why people want to be escapist.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.922]  That's all I wanna do now.
[01:03:28.922 --> 01:03:32.704]  Because I can't escape reality.
[01:03:32.704 --> 01:03:40.010]  And like I said, if these people weren't torturing kids, and all the other stuff they're doing, I could definitely make a deal.
[01:03:41.971 --> 01:03:52.579]  But every time I think about even imagining that, my soul jumps about five dimensions higher, getting away from hell, going, do not do that.
[01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:58.143]  These people are eternal death.
[01:03:58.143 --> 01:04:01.966]  And that's what sucks is they don't want to make a deal.
[01:04:01.966 --> 01:04:03.907]  They don't want to back off.
[01:04:03.907 --> 01:04:06.369]  They tell you, oh, make a deal, be reasonable.
[01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:10.973]  There's no making a deal with devil worshipers and child molesters.
[01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:11.373]  Same thing.
[01:04:19.042 --> 01:04:26.388]  In fact, all there is for me now is just shame that I ever thought it was cool to be in a movie.
[01:04:26.388 --> 01:04:33.374]  That I sat there at movie theaters and watched the credits go up and saw myself in movies and thought it was cool.
[01:04:33.374 --> 01:04:34.835]  Boy, that was pure evil.
[01:04:34.835 --> 01:04:37.797]  Or that I ever thought being friends with people that are from Hollywood is cool.
[01:04:37.797 --> 01:04:40.019]  There's none of them that are cool.
[01:04:40.019 --> 01:04:42.801]  I mean, it's such a liberating feeling though, isn't it folks?
[01:04:42.801 --> 01:04:42.961]  To just...
[01:04:45.824 --> 01:04:46.626]  We don't even hate them.
[01:04:46.626 --> 01:04:51.433]  We just don't want to ever talk to them or see them again.
[01:04:51.433 --> 01:04:53.677]  The problem is they want to run our lives.
[01:04:53.677 --> 01:04:56.742]  So they're force-feeding their psyche at ours, aren't they?
[01:05:01.041 --> 01:05:04.082]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:05:04.082 --> 01:05:10.504]  While coffee, candy and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.

[01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:09.034]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:39.279 --> 01:06:41.121]  It's a reptile snake farm.
[01:07:03.442 --> 01:07:06.104]  Ramona's got a keen sense of humor.
[01:07:06.104 --> 01:07:08.187]  She got a tattoo down her arm.
[01:07:08.187 --> 01:07:09.848]  It's of a python.
[01:07:09.848 --> 01:07:11.150]  Eating a little mouse.
[01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:13.872]  Wearing a set of hats that says Snake Farm.
[01:07:13.872 --> 01:07:15.034]  Snake Farm.
[01:07:15.034 --> 01:07:16.655]  It just sounds nasty.
[01:07:16.655 --> 01:07:17.777]  Snake Farm.
[01:07:17.777 --> 01:07:20.479]  It pretty much is Snake Farm.
[01:07:20.479 --> 01:07:22.001]  It's a reptile house.
[01:07:22.001 --> 01:07:22.782]  Snake Farm.
[01:07:35.489 --> 01:07:37.009]  That's Ray Wiley Hubbard.
[01:08:07.535 --> 01:08:10.577]  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention something.
[01:08:10.577 --> 01:08:14.719]  This is a sing-along.
[01:08:14.719 --> 01:08:17.020]  Really.
[01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:18.841]  Here goes Snake Farm.
[01:08:18.841 --> 01:08:20.262]  Just sounds nasty.
[01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:24.204]  Snake Farm pretty much is Snake Farm.
[01:08:24.204 --> 01:08:25.704]  It's a reptile house.
[01:08:25.704 --> 01:08:26.685]  Snake Farm.
[01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:30.107]  It ain't exactly Kumbaya, but...
[01:08:34.703 --> 01:08:37.765]  If you're in the music fog, it ought to be perfect.
[01:08:37.765 --> 01:08:40.367]  Help me now, be on T. You said Snake Farm?
[01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:41.788]  Just sound nasty.
[01:08:41.788 --> 01:08:43.589]  Snake Farm?
[01:08:43.589 --> 01:08:44.470]  Pretty much is.
[01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:45.731]  Snake Farm.
[01:08:45.731 --> 01:08:47.292]  It's a reptile house.
[01:08:47.292 --> 01:08:48.813]  Snake Farm.
[01:08:48.813 --> 01:08:50.654]  Ray Wiley Hubbard.
[01:08:50.654 --> 01:08:51.035]  Snake Farm?
[01:08:59.008 --> 01:08:59.809]  Just sounds nasty.
[01:08:59.809 --> 01:09:02.170]  Alright, this hour brought to you by Texas.
[01:09:02.170 --> 01:09:03.571]  Alright, let's get serious here.
[01:09:28.314 --> 01:09:34.378]  I'm gonna do this segment and the next and I'm done talking about Joe Rogan for a while because quite frankly, I got big fish to fry.
[01:09:34.378 --> 01:09:47.788]  But, turns out, with Joe Rogan, he's a stinky little fish, but you can catch Moby Dick with your little Joe Rogan.
[01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:52.231]  And so that's why we're doing this today.
[01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:54.032]  I've known Joe 20 years.
[01:09:54.032 --> 01:09:55.333]  Saw a lot of weird signs.
[01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:57.154]  Didn't pay attention to his podcast.
[01:09:57.154 --> 01:10:04.139]  My son, six months ago, starts calling him Joe the Snake Rogan.
[01:10:04.139 --> 01:10:09.202]  He says, yeah, dad, he backhands, attacks you, lies about you, all this stuff constantly, because my son was a fan.
[01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:13.010]  I said, I don't want to hear about it, son.
[01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:15.291]  So he started, you tell your son you don't want to hear about it.
[01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:16.152]  So 6 a.m.
[01:10:16.152 --> 01:10:21.716]  a lot of mornings where I'm in there cooking breakfast like I do every day, he comes in, plays me the clip.
[01:10:21.716 --> 01:10:22.677]  So I get more and more mad.
[01:10:23.956 --> 01:10:32.439]  And people start saying, you don't know about him running ayahuasca cults all over the country with government approval and DMT cults that nobody else could do, thousands of attendees per city.
[01:10:32.439 --> 01:10:34.020]  You don't know about all this stuff.
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:36.541]  You don't know about him and Jack Dorsey and Bitcoin.
[01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:42.824]  You don't know about how he's got over 50 sponsors, all big telecoms and big establishment people and everything else.
[01:10:42.824 --> 01:10:47.045]  And I'm like, no, I didn't know that.
[01:10:47.045 --> 01:10:49.486]  So I started researching.
[01:10:49.486 --> 01:10:50.807]  And let me go over this for you right here.
[01:10:52.108 --> 01:11:10.436]  Let me just start with the fact that he had Jack Dorsey, that psychopathic, slimy little monster on, and he didn't tell anybody that Jack Dorsey spends millions of dollars a quarter with Joe Rogan.
[01:11:10.436 --> 01:11:17.759]  And we'll get into the companies they push, but they push cryptocurrency bubbles.
[01:11:18.735 --> 01:11:22.297]  The whole two hours is pushing Bitcoin as the global currency.
[01:11:22.297 --> 01:11:24.338]  We need a global government.
[01:11:24.338 --> 01:11:27.339]  Never telling you, hey, we're heavily invested in this.
[01:11:27.339 --> 01:11:31.481]  Hey, as soon as it hit its market peak, Jack Dorsey dumped it.
[01:11:31.481 --> 01:11:33.162]  This makes Martha Stewart look like an angel.
[01:11:33.162 --> 01:11:43.347]  And not telling you that his cashless system is the number one sponsor on Joe's show for over a year.
[01:11:43.347 --> 01:11:45.528]  That's called unethical on its face.
[01:11:46.772 --> 01:11:49.073]  And that's just one of his sponsors.
[01:11:49.073 --> 01:11:51.294]  I started poking around.
[01:11:51.294 --> 01:11:58.637]  No wonder he said George Soros cut Hitler's head off and was a huge, you know, Captain America was basically him even though he was a Nazi.
[01:11:58.637 --> 01:12:01.538]  He's on the payroll.
[01:12:01.538 --> 01:12:03.739]  On the payroll, folks.
[01:12:03.739 --> 01:12:06.781]  So about a year and a half ago before Bitcoin plunge,
[01:12:08.092 --> 01:12:14.335]  I'd already turned down $100,000, $200,000 a month to take on these different Bitcoin companies.
[01:12:14.335 --> 01:12:18.418]  And I wasn't saying crypto itself was bad, but I knew that it had been pushed by the establishment.
[01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:25.802]  It was being put out as this, oh, global currency, but it's anti-establishment to get folks to adopt it.
[01:12:25.802 --> 01:12:29.704]  Only way you can get the grassroots to do it is act like it's anti-establishment.
[01:12:29.704 --> 01:12:36.808]  And so I saw that going on, and then it reached a million dollars a month that they were ready to pay me, these companies.
[01:12:39.468 --> 01:12:45.492]  And I remember talking to family and I said, this is like the tulip bubble, whether it's a real technology or not.
[01:12:45.492 --> 01:12:51.675]  I'm not telling my listeners get involved in something that's offering me a million dollars a month.
[01:12:51.675 --> 01:12:53.817]  That means they're about to dump it.
[01:12:53.817 --> 01:12:57.259]  The fact it's gone from a hundred thousand a month offer with companies to a million a month.
[01:12:57.699 --> 01:13:00.421]  Means they're pulling their money out in the Ponzi scheme.
[01:13:00.421 --> 01:13:11.088]  They want to bring in all the new suckers with a big advertising push to prop it up so it collapses months later and they don't get the blame for pulling their money out, which is the crime, when they know it's going down.
[01:13:11.088 --> 01:13:16.232]  It's called the pump and dump.
[01:13:16.232 --> 01:13:20.174]  Now, old Joe likes to giggle with Mr. Darcy.
[01:13:20.174 --> 01:13:22.916]  And the both of them want to sue me.
[01:13:22.916 --> 01:13:25.098]  Sweet as pie, let's do it, because I like that discovery.
[01:13:26.923 --> 01:13:30.948]  But I know Jack Dorsey knows good and damn well what he's doing.
[01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:35.855]  And I looked it up, he dumped it right at it's height.
[01:13:35.855 --> 01:13:38.639]  And he says in the video, we'll play in the next segment, OH!
[01:13:40.775 --> 01:13:46.723]  Oh, I talked to the Securities and Exchange Commission about how we should handle this.
[01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.145]  They're my good friends.
[01:13:48.145 --> 01:13:54.052]  Yes, you give lobbying money to and then what you're saying is like Arthur Anderson let Enron run all those scams.
[01:13:54.052 --> 01:13:56.916]  He even is name-dropping in just a five-minute clip.
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:02.482]  That, oh, by the way, I'm hanging out with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[01:14:02.482 --> 01:14:08.984]  It must feel big to be wearing them top hats like, I say, I say, boy, we taking care of it.
[01:14:08.984 --> 01:14:17.027]  We going to get all these tens of millions of listeners, all these pothead wannabe ninjas on the line to get them some Bitcoin.
[01:14:17.027 --> 01:14:21.188]  We already pumped that sucker up once and drained it before we dropped it on the head.
[01:14:21.188 --> 01:14:26.470]  And these dumb ass sucker going to come in for another big old pile driver.
[01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:27.871]  I say, I say, I say.
[01:14:29.915 --> 01:14:34.557]  So, that's what makes me sick about all this.
[01:14:34.557 --> 01:14:44.420]  Is that, I mentioned this yesterday, and the internet was on fire with the fact that his main sponsor is Jack Dorsey's other company, Squared.
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:47.642]  And when they found out it was true, they went crazy!
[01:14:47.642 --> 01:14:53.404]  For years, he's like, I sure love Squared, and I sure love doing my banking with it.
[01:14:53.404 --> 01:14:56.525]  And I love Bitcoin, and I think you ought to buy this Bitcoin.
[01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:02.337]  What was it, Floyd Waymather had to pay, what was it?
[01:15:02.337 --> 01:15:04.219]  I didn't look up, I didn't check it this morning.
[01:15:04.219 --> 01:15:06.320]  Was it like 300-something thousand dollars?
[01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:10.543]  All the money he made just mentioning some Bitcoin deal.
[01:15:10.543 --> 01:15:16.307]  He didn't tell you, oh by the way, I'm getting paid to promote a security.
[01:15:16.307 --> 01:15:22.812]  But see Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan, why they're smart men and you're not.
[01:15:22.812 --> 01:15:28.556]  They get up on there and they're just like, I love this Bitcoin, oh it's gonna go to the sky.
[01:15:30.499 --> 01:15:33.702]  Oh, I love this wireless digital system.
[01:15:33.702 --> 01:15:39.086]  None of them mention they own it, or that it's a sponsor for them.
[01:15:39.086 --> 01:15:45.491]  Joe's like, I say, I declare, Jack Dorsey, have you heard of this here digital system?
[01:15:45.491 --> 01:15:49.014]  Dorsey's like, I think it's the future, baby.
[01:15:49.014 --> 01:15:49.974]  Oh, good!
[01:15:49.974 --> 01:15:55.319]  The good news is your listeners hate your guts now, dog.

[01:19:10.393 --> 01:19:11.994]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:19:11.994 --> 01:19:12.494]  We stopped her.
[01:19:12.494 --> 01:19:14.676]  We got a nationalist in.

[01:20:09.266 --> 01:20:25.033]  Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.
[01:20:32.185 --> 01:20:37.273]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.832 --> 01:20:42.834]  I believe it's something that everyone has a right to.
[01:20:42.834 --> 01:20:43.715]  Everyone has a right to.
[01:20:43.715 --> 01:20:45.135]  But you still ban people.
[01:20:45.135 --> 01:20:46.976]  Like, say, Alex Jones.
[01:20:46.976 --> 01:20:49.898]  You guys were the last guys to keep Alex Jones on the platform.
[01:20:49.898 --> 01:20:50.899]  You were the last ones.
[01:20:50.899 --> 01:20:51.519]  Yeah.
[01:20:51.519 --> 01:20:55.001]  And I believe you hung in there until he started harassing you personally, right?
[01:20:55.001 --> 01:20:56.422]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:56.422 --> 01:20:56.882]  He did not.
[01:20:56.882 --> 01:21:00.704]  He came to your house, he banged you.
[01:21:00.704 --> 01:21:00.864]  No.
[01:21:00.864 --> 01:21:01.124]  No.
[01:21:01.124 --> 01:21:04.066]  He did very different things on our platform versus the others.
[01:21:04.966 --> 01:21:05.606]  I don't know.
[01:21:26.835 --> 01:21:28.616]  Afterwards, he did.
[01:21:28.616 --> 01:21:37.162]  And we have, you know, we have a policy, and if there's a violation, we take enforcement actions.
[01:21:37.162 --> 01:21:40.945]  One might be asking the account holder to delete the tweet.
[01:21:40.945 --> 01:21:44.327]  Another might be... Arnold Shipp, pause.
[01:21:44.327 --> 01:21:49.191]  Censorship is Twitter's ether.
[01:21:49.191 --> 01:21:51.092]  It's like fish swim in the ocean.
[01:21:51.092 --> 01:21:51.633]  They're the worst.
[01:21:52.546 --> 01:21:56.287]  And it's a giant social engineering AI experiment.
[01:21:56.287 --> 01:21:58.148]  He basically admits that.
[01:21:58.148 --> 01:22:13.533]  If you're Antifa doxing people's houses and saying kill them and bullying and you're New York Times board members saying whites are subhumans, let's kill them all, you're like, whoa, I mean, this is hardcore San Francisco evil.
[01:22:13.533 --> 01:22:17.574]  So he's sitting there, but then says, oh, we don't censor anybody.
[01:22:17.574 --> 01:22:19.075]  Everybody deserves to be on social media.
[01:22:19.946 --> 01:22:22.588]  So we can track you and surveil you and control you.
[01:22:22.588 --> 01:22:24.149]  But Alex Jones was different.
[01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:25.510]  There was a domino.
[01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:27.032]  We wanted to be different.
[01:22:27.032 --> 01:22:29.754]  Yeah, they were having meetings at their headquarters that came out.
[01:22:29.754 --> 01:22:31.475]  They decided to leave them to last.
[01:22:31.475 --> 01:22:32.816]  I knew that was coming.
[01:22:32.816 --> 01:22:36.359]  And then Joe's like, yeah, he harassed you.
[01:22:36.359 --> 01:22:37.800]  No, we played the clip yesterday.
[01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:38.841]  We'll cue it up later.
[01:22:38.841 --> 01:22:46.747]  I said, hey, thanks for saying your pro-free speech, but you went on TV and said that I said kill the media with battle rifles.
[01:22:46.747 --> 01:22:47.328]  That's not true.
[01:22:49.281 --> 01:22:50.802]  That's bullying.
[01:22:50.802 --> 01:22:55.643]  But Joe Rogan's this SJW, even though he's quite a UFC, you know, guru.
[01:22:55.643 --> 01:22:57.424]  He's like, you got bullied too, didn't you?
[01:22:57.424 --> 01:23:03.386]  You're this big CEO at a hearing and somebody said something to you.
[01:23:03.386 --> 01:23:06.787]  You don't, I mean, he goes, oh no, that's not why.
[01:23:06.787 --> 01:23:14.010]  Well, it's not even the reason they give of Oliver Darcy or Dorsey.
[01:23:14.010 --> 01:23:18.832]  It's not even the reason they give dealing with CNN and their reporter claiming that I bullied him.
[01:23:20.313 --> 01:23:24.790]  It's that in the meetings they said, we're worried about censorship, we've been caught.
[01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:30.884]  We're worried Republicans will figure out our discrimination, our federal elections communications violations.
[01:23:30.884 --> 01:23:37.729]  We don't know what to do, but since Jones got in the face of Rubio, maybe Republicans won't get mad at us.
[01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:40.931]  That's the weird level, psycho stuff of them.
[01:23:40.931 --> 01:23:52.000]  As if I give a rat's ass about being on your fetid, fake, little bastardized, Hollywood scumbag program, you chicken neck, feeble little piece of crap.
[01:23:53.183 --> 01:23:57.425]  It wants to sell people fake bitcoins and pomp and dump operations.
[01:23:57.425 --> 01:24:04.850]  I mean, you want to be in California huffing the demonic fumes, you and Rogan, your little stool pigeon.
[01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:06.191]  Your little footstool.
[01:24:06.191 --> 01:24:07.591]  What a joke.
[01:24:07.591 --> 01:24:10.373]  God, you're pathetic.
[01:24:10.373 --> 01:24:11.454]  Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[01:24:11.454 --> 01:24:12.274]  Here, let's go back to the clip.
[01:24:12.274 --> 01:24:13.895]  Here it is.
[01:24:13.895 --> 01:24:15.256]  A temporary suspension.
[01:24:15.256 --> 01:24:17.817]  Another might be a permanent suspension.
[01:24:17.817 --> 01:24:19.678]  So, what are you saying?
[01:24:19.678 --> 01:24:20.519]  Hit pause again.
[01:24:22.179 --> 01:24:30.987]  Because he wants you to do your banking on Twitter, and he wants you to face-scan to access Twitter, face-scanning to buy and sell, for a global government, global currency.
[01:24:30.987 --> 01:24:33.629]  That clip's coming up.
[01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:36.812]  So he's going to ban you for life, like you're in prison for life.
[01:24:36.812 --> 01:24:37.813]  I didn't commit a murder.
[01:24:37.813 --> 01:24:38.714]  No, no, no.
[01:24:38.714 --> 01:24:47.141]  I saw Oliver Dorsey, or Darcy, not Jack Dorsey, of CNN, and said, how dare you be anti-free speech?
[01:24:47.141 --> 01:24:49.063]  That was bullying, oh Lord.
[01:24:50.250 --> 01:25:03.136]  You see, but, oh, Joe Rogan, the poor kid from Boston, the one-room apartment, he gets snobby with the CEO, and oh, oh, he bullied you, didn't he, John?
[01:25:03.136 --> 01:25:05.277]  Oh, let's talk about it with you right now.
[01:25:05.277 --> 01:25:06.177]  Let's continue.
[01:25:07.361 --> 01:25:11.442]  So let's use in terms of like him saying that Sandy Hook was fake.
[01:25:11.442 --> 01:25:13.863]  He did not say that on the platform.
[01:25:13.863 --> 01:25:15.164]  Pause again.
[01:25:15.164 --> 01:25:15.944]  Back it up.
[01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:22.386]  So in America, you can't say, hey, they've staged all this other stuff before, so I question something.
[01:25:22.386 --> 01:25:25.047]  And then even years later, I say, no, I think that happened.
[01:25:25.047 --> 01:25:28.168]  Joe will never say that I said that it happened years ago.
[01:25:28.168 --> 01:25:29.669]  He just repeats the lie.
[01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:34.014]  So then he says to Jack, well then what was the offense?
[01:25:34.014 --> 01:25:38.598]  And Jack can't say what the offense was because it was made up crap.
[01:25:38.598 --> 01:25:44.342]  And he doesn't want to open it up for a lawsuit because he knows we have moles inside his fetid organization.
[01:25:44.342 --> 01:25:45.083]  Which is the hope.
[01:25:45.083 --> 01:25:46.624]  People figure out this is a cult.
[01:25:46.624 --> 01:25:49.006]  He's using mind control on his employees.
[01:25:49.006 --> 01:25:51.889]  And a lot of these SJWs are coming up from air, which is a good thing.
[01:25:51.889 --> 01:25:52.129]  Here it is.
[01:25:53.203 --> 01:25:57.286]  So like, let's use in terms of like, him saying that Sandy Hook was fake.
[01:25:57.286 --> 01:25:59.327]  He did not say that on the platform.
[01:25:59.327 --> 01:26:00.608]  He did not say that on Twitter.
[01:26:00.608 --> 01:26:01.749]  He only said that on his show.
[01:26:01.749 --> 01:26:04.931]  I don't know, I don't know all the mediums he said it in.
[01:26:04.931 --> 01:26:06.032]  What did he do?
[01:26:06.032 --> 01:26:07.593]  Pause again!
[01:26:07.593 --> 01:26:10.895]  In America, are we allowed to have free speech?
[01:26:10.895 --> 01:26:21.302]  But see, now it's this thing, where they misrepresent what you've said, they never have you on to debate it, then they have a straw man, and then they make it like, well, did he say it here?
[01:26:21.302 --> 01:26:21.802]  Let's continue.
[01:26:22.421 --> 01:26:28.286]  What we're looking at is the, is the, is the conduct and what he did on our platform.
[01:26:28.286 --> 01:26:33.490]  So what did he do on your platform that was like, that you all were in agreement that this is enough?
[01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:34.471]  Hey, pause again!
[01:26:34.471 --> 01:26:37.294]  You were all in agreement this is enough.
[01:26:37.294 --> 01:26:38.855]  Mind control terms.
[01:26:38.855 --> 01:26:40.837]  I'm a guy that runs an ayahuasca cult.
[01:26:40.837 --> 01:26:41.978]  Illegally.
[01:26:41.978 --> 01:26:42.918]  And a DMT cult.
[01:26:42.918 --> 01:26:46.942]  With huge facilities everywhere, giant sex parties, everything else just totally illegal.
[01:26:46.942 --> 01:26:49.944]  Beyond any cult you'd ever imagine, just totally out in the open, no big deal.
[01:26:49.944 --> 01:26:50.605]  Because he's protected!
[01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:55.263]  Notice Joe isn't countering any of this, saying I'm full of crap.
[01:26:55.263 --> 01:26:57.965]  Oh, oh, the witnesses are on.
[01:26:57.965 --> 01:27:01.348]  Next week, if I want them.
[01:27:01.348 --> 01:27:04.571]  Fill your hand, man.
[01:27:04.571 --> 01:27:07.433]  And your gangsters in Vegas think I'm scared of you?
[01:27:07.433 --> 01:27:10.996]  Hmm, we'll find out, punk.
[01:27:10.996 --> 01:27:15.679]  All your crap runs into a brick wall at some point, doesn't it, son?
[01:27:15.679 --> 01:27:19.522]  Think I'm scared of you and your little, your little gangster buddies in Vegas?
[01:27:19.522 --> 01:27:20.523]  I already ran over Hillary.
[01:27:27.685 --> 01:27:30.447]  I was born to run over punks like you.
[01:27:30.447 --> 01:27:37.211]  Always think they got the upper hand, until they realize they stuck their arm in the wrong freaking garbage disposal.
[01:27:37.211 --> 01:27:40.153]  Back to him.
[01:27:40.153 --> 01:27:48.698]  I'm not sure what the actual violations were, but we have a set number of actions, and if
[01:27:54.301 --> 01:28:01.785]  If you don't submit to us, you don't get to go on the cashless program of Twitter, the big global government matrix.
[01:28:01.785 --> 01:28:08.408]  I'll show when we come back where he wants you to face scan to be able to get on Twitter and that's the new social score to buy and sell.
[01:28:08.408 --> 01:28:14.871]  He is competing for that to literally be the slave grid in America.
[01:28:14.871 --> 01:28:19.614]  And then he's the number one sponsor of the Joe Rogan toilet bowl experience.
[01:28:22.202 --> 01:28:33.807]  And he doesn't even tell you when he's on, and he's pushing Bitcoin pump and dumps, and his damn cashless society, Bitcoin Project.
[01:28:33.807 --> 01:28:37.008]  We'll show you those clips when we come back.
[01:28:37.008 --> 01:28:38.609]  Fire at will, Commander!
[01:28:38.609 --> 01:28:45.352]  So anyways, I'm gonna bathe myself.
[01:28:45.352 --> 01:28:48.453]  I'm so scared right now.
[01:28:48.453 --> 01:28:48.773]  Upside.

[01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:33.948]  You think I'm afraid of being nothing?
[01:33:33.948 --> 01:33:35.610]  I came from nothing.
[01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:39.113]  And I'm here to make you nothing, globalist.
[01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:45.179]  I'm here to bring you down.
[01:33:45.179 --> 01:33:50.103]  Hot and cold, rotten soul, the hottest, hottest gold.
[01:33:50.103 --> 01:33:52.485]  Yeah, are you satisfied?
[01:33:54.721 --> 01:34:04.888]  Alright, let me get serious, because I've been having some fun here, and I need to open the phones up, get into other important news, and take your phone calls here on this Monday Global Transmission.
[01:34:04.888 --> 01:34:07.310]  So, my listeners are like, why do you like Joe Rogan?
[01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:09.511]  He's a total globalist cunt.
[01:34:09.511 --> 01:34:14.295]  I've known him 20 years, whatever, friends with him, but I didn't pay attention to long-form podcasts.
[01:34:14.295 --> 01:34:23.021]  And then, he would do anti-America, pro-Soros talking points, and I kind of got in his face about it.
[01:34:23.942 --> 01:34:30.345]  And then I began to research, and the fact is he's the globalist cutting edge.
[01:34:30.345 --> 01:34:37.749]  With the dying mainstream media and their whole system, they believe that Joe is their savior.
[01:34:37.749 --> 01:34:39.770]  And so I've laid out here the anatomy.
[01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:53.577]  In fact, when we post this later to different platforms, we should take a few minutes of this segment, put it on front of this hour, because I'm just quantifying here my own awakening to this and seeing what's going on, and then like, wait a minute,
[01:34:54.702 --> 01:34:58.788]  He keeps plugging this product, that's Jack Dorsey's company squared!
[01:34:58.788 --> 01:35:07.880]  And they're not telling people it's Jack Dorsey, and it's Jack Dorsey with Bitcoin, and Jack Dorsey that dumped the money right when Bitcoin went down.
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:09.422]  Clear insider trading.
[01:35:12.765 --> 01:35:16.310]  Yeah, Bitcoin plunged as Jack Dorsey made it available to Square users.
[01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:23.219]  Because they were getting all the new general public in, while they were sucking the hundreds of millions and billions out the back door.
[01:35:23.219 --> 01:35:24.942]  I mean, that's even Bloomberg and Forbes!
[01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:31.252]  And then I went back and I was checking, like years ago, Joe was promoting all this.
[01:35:31.252 --> 01:35:43.598]  And I'm like, whoa, I was offered a million dollars a month at one point a year and a half ago, right when they were already pulling the money out, when they really do the advertising to get suckers in, so the globalists get all their money out, you see.
[01:35:43.598 --> 01:35:46.199]  Wow.
[01:35:46.199 --> 01:35:48.340]  And in my view, Joe knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:51.121]  What a monstrous person.
[01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:53.983]  So, he comes out and worships
[01:35:55.748 --> 01:35:58.670]  Jack Dorsey, it blows up in his face.
[01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:00.611]  This is as of like a few hours ago, now it's even more.
[01:36:00.611 --> 01:36:08.355]  7,000 to 50,000, that's like 8 to 1 against him.
[01:36:08.355 --> 01:36:13.378]  And again, this isn't bigger than Joe Rogan, but who's Joe Rogan if you're a regular talk radio listener?
[01:36:13.378 --> 01:36:18.600]  To pothead wannabe ninja trendies, he is like Papa Smurf.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.362]  And he is Smurf-like, which is okay.
[01:36:21.362 --> 01:36:25.204]  I'm like a giant compared to Joe, but he's a very muscular person for a midget.
[01:36:27.213 --> 01:36:29.573]  But I digress.
[01:36:29.573 --> 01:36:30.654]  Nothing against potheads.
[01:36:30.654 --> 01:36:43.776]  The point is, he's like, his market was, teach potheads their Ninja Warlords and get them to take hallucinogens.
[01:36:43.776 --> 01:36:45.317]  So, that's all unfolded.
[01:36:45.317 --> 01:36:48.857]  And the comments are 99 to 1 against him.
[01:36:48.857 --> 01:36:52.138]  But let's get into the real scam here now and understand how the leftists work.
[01:36:52.138 --> 01:36:53.598]  They're all about being trendy.
[01:36:53.598 --> 01:36:55.399]  But nothing's more untrendy than being a leftist.
[01:36:58.052 --> 01:37:04.538]  Formerly known as Square Cash is a mobile payment service developed by Square Inc.
[01:37:04.538 --> 01:37:08.562]  allowing users to transfer money to one another using a mobile phone app.
[01:37:08.562 --> 01:37:17.831]  As of February 2018, the service has 7 million users and it goes on to say it's owned by Jack Dorsey, owner of Twitter.
[01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.953]  Tracking Twitter bots with biometrics.
[01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:23.760]  That's a big news story.
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.802]  He wants you to facecan to get online for your buying and selling, but also just to get on Twitter.
[01:37:28.802 --> 01:37:31.303]  So he wants to nexus it all together.
[01:37:31.303 --> 01:37:35.845]  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has made a bold prediction about Bitcoin.
[01:37:35.845 --> 01:37:38.926]  On Joe Rogan's show, he said it's going to just surge.
[01:37:38.926 --> 01:37:44.468]  So Bitcoin has gone down 85% in the last year.
[01:37:44.468 --> 01:37:46.088]  There's a graph.
[01:37:46.088 --> 01:37:47.769]  And it's still going down, but don't worry.
[01:37:50.083 --> 01:37:52.124]  He bought it all right here.
[01:37:52.124 --> 01:37:53.744]  You can bet that's when he bought.
[01:37:53.744 --> 01:37:55.164]  That's what made it go up a little bit.
[01:37:55.164 --> 01:38:00.966]  So Jack, who got out right here, Jack got out at its peak.
[01:38:00.966 --> 01:38:07.328]  That's when Jack got out, or jaw.
[01:38:07.328 --> 01:38:10.749]  And then this is where he got back in.
[01:38:10.749 --> 01:38:12.609]  It's a very computer low.
[01:38:12.609 --> 01:38:14.530]  And the computer saw that and pushed it a bit.
[01:38:16.328 --> 01:38:21.095]  And he's going on Joe Rogan's show, known as Sucker Plantation.
[01:38:21.095 --> 01:38:23.578]  Dumbass planet base.
[01:38:23.578 --> 01:38:25.221]  Idiot, moron, level.
[01:38:26.607 --> 01:38:30.090]  And he says, oh, this is the biggest thing, the global currency.
[01:38:30.090 --> 01:38:32.012]  It's going to take over.
[01:38:32.012 --> 01:38:36.195]  Oh, so they can run it up a little bit before they dump it again.
[01:38:36.195 --> 01:38:38.357]  You'll be so stoned.
[01:38:38.357 --> 01:38:43.521]  You won't even know the Dorsey gets a couple hundred million on your ass.
[01:38:43.521 --> 01:38:51.968]  But after all, he's the trendy with Snake Farm, Joe Rogan, Snake Farm, Snake Farm.
[01:38:51.968 --> 01:38:53.429]  So.
[01:38:53.429 --> 01:38:55.151]  Let's get to that next clip of them.
[01:38:56.448 --> 01:38:59.630]  Out there pushing Bitcoin as the global currency.
[01:38:59.630 --> 01:39:04.133]  Which, you know, they created Bitcoin, the globalists did, because they knew cryptocurrency was coming.
[01:39:04.133 --> 01:39:05.234]  They wanted to fight it.
[01:39:05.234 --> 01:39:06.855]  They wanted to control it.
[01:39:06.855 --> 01:39:10.758]  They wanted to dominate it, make trillions on its ups and downs.
[01:39:10.758 --> 01:39:15.081]  Regulators control it, and then it becomes the global currency with a dollar in plugs.
[01:39:15.081 --> 01:39:21.125]  And so here they are, not telling you they're heavily invested, not telling you they've got a computer program that interfaces with it.
[01:39:21.125 --> 01:39:22.466]  It's the sponsor of the show.
[01:39:22.466 --> 01:39:24.828]  Joe's looking down at the video, he's like, oh my gosh!
[01:39:26.218 --> 01:39:26.999]  It's incredible.
[01:39:26.999 --> 01:39:29.962]  I love Cash App.
[01:39:29.962 --> 01:39:31.023]  It's so amazing.
[01:39:31.023 --> 01:39:33.205]  Square Cash.
[01:39:33.205 --> 01:39:34.046]  Everyone's using it.
[01:39:34.046 --> 01:39:36.088]  Do you know anything about it?
[01:39:36.088 --> 01:39:37.429]  Well, I'm the owner.
[01:39:37.429 --> 01:39:39.832]  No, I don't know anything about it.
[01:39:39.832 --> 01:39:43.135]  Oh my God, it's so trendy.
[01:39:43.135 --> 01:39:44.256]  So let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:39:44.256 --> 01:39:44.556]  Here it is.
[01:39:45.296 --> 01:39:54.460]  One of our, one of our, like, equivalent operating principles within cash and square is, like, under, like, how do we understand someone's struggle?
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:57.761]  Like, how do we understand, like, how do we have the empathy for, like, what they're struggling with?
[01:39:57.761 --> 01:40:00.682]  And, like, when it comes to finance, they're struggling with a lot.
[01:40:00.682 --> 01:40:01.282]  Yeah.
[01:40:01.282 --> 01:40:03.283]  Typically, they're struggling with a ton.
[01:40:03.283 --> 01:40:09.265]  What was the thought process with, I mean, one of the things that's kind of cool about the Cash App is that you can buy and sell Bitcoin with it.
[01:40:09.265 --> 01:40:09.966]  Yeah.
[01:40:09.966 --> 01:40:10.346]  Are you?
[01:40:10.346 --> 01:40:11.826]  Oh, it's so, he looks so cool.
[01:40:11.826 --> 01:40:12.907]  He has his notes written by
[01:40:14.093 --> 01:40:16.514]  Twitter, the parent company of this company.
[01:40:16.514 --> 01:40:18.755]  He doesn't say, by the way, this is my biggest sponsor.
[01:40:18.755 --> 01:40:21.136]  He's like, oh, so cool about it.
[01:40:21.136 --> 01:40:23.617]  It's so cool.
[01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:24.658]  Pump and dump.
[01:40:24.658 --> 01:40:25.918]  Sorry, let's go back to Joe Rogan.
[01:40:25.918 --> 01:40:27.039]  Yeah.
[01:40:27.039 --> 01:40:31.701]  Are you guys going to consider other forms of cryptocurrency as well?
[01:40:31.701 --> 01:40:33.722]  Not right now.
[01:40:33.722 --> 01:40:36.583]  So back to the Internet, I believe the Internet will have a native currency.
[01:40:37.273 --> 01:40:37.774]  Really?
[01:40:37.774 --> 01:40:39.816]  It'll have a native currency and I don't know if it's Bitcoin.
[01:40:39.816 --> 01:40:48.366]  I think it will because just given all the tests it's been through and the principles behind it, how it was created and... Hit pause again.
[01:40:48.366 --> 01:40:53.711]  The principles, the internet invented it, came out of some secret black box.
[01:40:54.591 --> 01:40:59.675]  It's a big thing, I mean, you know.
[01:40:59.675 --> 01:41:05.239]  I got a cashless system, you know.
[01:41:05.239 --> 01:41:07.800]  San Francisco, we don't censor.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.582]  Continue.
[01:41:09.582 --> 01:41:15.466]  You know, it was something that was born on the internet, that was developed on the internet, that was tested on the internet.
[01:41:15.466 --> 01:41:16.447]  Pause again.
[01:41:16.447 --> 01:41:21.010]  Like the DARPA didn't make the internet, nobody did.
[01:41:21.010 --> 01:41:22.911]  We're not spying on you or anything.
[01:41:22.911 --> 01:41:23.792]  Come on, let's go back to...
[01:41:25.403 --> 01:41:45.060]  And the reason we, um... Oh, oh, oh, so here's Joe, mmm, mmm, he's like, oh, oh, Jack Dorsey, he's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[01:41:48.311 --> 01:41:50.472]  Sorry, Family Show, I promised earlier.
[01:41:50.472 --> 01:41:51.572]  But I mean, it's really happening.
[01:41:51.572 --> 01:41:52.472]  Let's go back.
[01:41:52.472 --> 01:41:54.553]  It is of the Internet.
[01:41:54.553 --> 01:42:07.477]  And the reason we enabled the purchasing of Bitcoin within the Cash App is, one, we want to learn about the technology and we want to put ourselves out there and take some risks.
[01:42:07.477 --> 01:42:11.218]  We're the first publicly traded company to actually offer it as a service.
[01:42:11.218 --> 01:42:12.058]  We're the first publicly
[01:42:12.738 --> 01:42:20.766]  Trade a company to talk to the SEC about Bitcoin and what that what that means and pause again It's all sir serpent talking.
[01:42:20.766 --> 01:42:35.399]  It's the first I mean these are guys that train all day to be the slimiest little lizard scums they can An old media they control is like give us your five-year-olds.
[01:42:35.399 --> 01:42:37.621]  We're gonna rape them world government Satanism
[01:42:40.564 --> 01:42:54.231]  We're gonna finish up with this and come back but I mean like they say in revelations after the devil's dominated Christians can look at the devil on occasion say this is what Venus this was the problem this Joe Rogan the snake man
[01:43:06.693 --> 01:43:15.699]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.699 --> 01:43:25.785]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.785 --> 01:43:34.311]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.131 --> 01:43:36.492]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.492 --> 01:43:37.653]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.653 --> 01:43:39.755]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:44.639]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.639 --> 01:43:46.160]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:47.661]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.661 --> 01:43:54.346]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[01:44:58.422 --> 01:45:11.851]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:45:11.851 --> 01:45:22.899]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:45:24.207 --> 01:45:26.134]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:45:26.134 --> 01:45:28.803]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:45:30.162 --> 01:45:34.505]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:45:34.505 --> 01:45:41.031]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:45:41.031 --> 01:45:43.352]  This country is in a war!

[01:47:18.839 --> 01:47:24.525]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:47:24.525 --> 01:47:26.827]  You're listening to Alex Jones!
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:29.462]  Oh, there's no doubt.
[01:47:29.462 --> 01:47:31.204]  I align myself with the truth.
[01:47:31.204 --> 01:47:34.488]  I'm very honored you're our listeners to put up with me.
[01:47:34.488 --> 01:47:37.432]  But I'm taking care of unfinished business.
[01:47:37.432 --> 01:47:39.194]  And it's bigger than Jack Dorsey of Twitter.
[01:47:39.194 --> 01:47:41.317]  It's bigger than Joe Rogan.
[01:47:41.317 --> 01:47:44.461]  It's a pilgrim's progress of traitorous activity.
[01:47:46.209 --> 01:47:51.193]  As a fact that I ignored it even though I kind of halfway knew it was going on, but now I'm gonna make good.
[01:47:51.193 --> 01:47:55.796]  Oh, we're, we're, oh, it's deep investigations.
[01:47:55.796 --> 01:48:00.219]  So much is about to come out on Jack Dorsey, on Rogan, on all of it.
[01:48:00.219 --> 01:48:01.740]  We're gonna give you everything here.
[01:48:01.740 --> 01:48:07.364]  And no matter what happens to me, it's all coming out.
[01:48:07.364 --> 01:48:13.949]  So all you little nerds thinking you got a bunch of unconscious slaves you're feeding on, eh, see how tough you are, UFC bad boy.
[01:48:16.886 --> 01:48:17.686]  Cause I'm so scared.
[01:48:17.686 --> 01:48:22.007]  Cause everybody knows, all you people.
[01:48:22.007 --> 01:48:23.547]  No, I'm scared of God, not you.
[01:48:23.547 --> 01:48:32.249]  And so, uh... Let's just say politically, your ribs are gonna be broken up bad.
[01:48:32.249 --> 01:48:37.270]  It hurts to breathe with those ribs broken, doesn't it?
[01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:42.431]  And I'm just mad I didn't know about this earlier, but I'm glad I know now.
[01:48:42.431 --> 01:48:42.611]  Show!
[01:48:43.911 --> 01:48:46.013]  Billions of dollars of U.S.
[01:48:46.013 --> 01:48:49.475]  citizens have been lost on Bitcoin scams.
[01:48:49.475 --> 01:48:51.917]  Hundreds of billions worldwide.
[01:48:51.917 --> 01:48:55.400]  The people that created the pump and the dump.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.062]  And now Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan think you're so stupid.
[01:48:59.062 --> 01:49:01.304]  They're back with a great new cash system.
[01:49:01.304 --> 01:49:07.149]  You go online and sign up for it with Twitter, and then they get you good deals on Bitcoin.
[01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:08.169]  It's coming back!
[01:49:08.169 --> 01:49:09.210]  It's the future!
[01:49:09.210 --> 01:49:11.392]  Why, it's gonna be the new global currency!
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:20.522]  And Jack Dorsey's got a face scan, yeah?
[01:49:20.522 --> 01:49:23.583]  Before you can even get on Twitter or use your money.
[01:49:23.583 --> 01:49:27.845]  So now it's the Chinese social score.
[01:49:27.845 --> 01:49:31.907]  They used to call that the mark of the beast.
[01:49:31.907 --> 01:49:32.767]  But here's the good news.
[01:49:32.767 --> 01:49:40.451]  8 to 1, people are against this.
[01:49:43.328 --> 01:49:47.811]  And so YouTube's come out today and said, let me just show you the article.
[01:49:47.811 --> 01:49:48.711]  Well, I'll just tell you.
[01:49:48.711 --> 01:49:53.714]  You know, if I've got a sponsor, I'll tell you it's a sponsor.
[01:49:53.714 --> 01:49:57.377]  Oh, I love your, I love this company Cash App.
[01:49:57.377 --> 01:49:59.278]  I just love Bitcoin.
[01:49:59.278 --> 01:50:01.159]  You're just a big pumper dumper.
[01:50:02.939 --> 01:50:10.281]  Floyd Waybrother had to pay all his money back for promoting Bitcoin deals, not telling folks he was getting money for it.
[01:50:10.281 --> 01:50:17.564]  But old JoJo Rogan, why he's sitting in the lap of Jack Dorsey so he can do whatever he wants.
[01:50:17.564 --> 01:50:21.785]  After all, Jack Dorsey said, I talked to the SEC.
[01:50:21.785 --> 01:50:25.166]  I can do whatever I want.
[01:50:25.166 --> 01:50:27.787]  But see, your listeners can do whatever they want too.
[01:50:29.246 --> 01:50:36.630]  So see, I'm here telling them what's going on so they can start to investigate Cash App.
[01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:39.072]  The equivalent of payday loans online.
[01:50:39.072 --> 01:50:46.716]  So Jack Dorsey knows everything in the system that you buy and sell and do in the blockchain.
[01:50:46.716 --> 01:50:50.898]  Because Jack Dorsey's a predator.
[01:50:50.898 --> 01:50:51.959]  And he thinks you're an idiot.
[01:50:55.233 --> 01:50:59.635]  You know what we need is not a tyrannical square, but a free, open, public square.
[01:50:59.635 --> 01:51:01.796]  A free square!
[01:51:01.796 --> 01:51:07.679]  Not a neurotic, control freak, needle ding dong area.
[01:51:07.679 --> 01:51:10.201]  That's getting a little off family, I apologize.
[01:51:10.201 --> 01:51:22.667]  We need to have utilities that aren't a bunch of lying control freaks that say they're not censoring us when they're on all their internal videos and memos censoring everybody who is pro-America and we know it!
[01:51:25.899 --> 01:51:33.106]  The only reason he comes out and says, oh Trump's no better or worse than Obama is because he knows Trump has regulatory power to stop him.
[01:51:33.106 --> 01:51:43.076]  So this has been some unfinished business and you know I've exposed ayahuasca cult, DMT cult,
[01:51:44.332 --> 01:51:52.339]  Joe Rogan owning facilities all over the country where they have mass drugging of women and men in separate groups and stuff beyond MKUltra.
[01:51:52.339 --> 01:51:55.321]  And I just was like, oh my God, I can't believe this is going on.
[01:51:55.321 --> 01:51:57.463]  And I was almost like, eh, why have the witnesses on?
[01:51:57.463 --> 01:52:00.105]  You know, the public are slaves, you know, move on.
[01:52:00.105 --> 01:52:03.768]  But then it's like, wait, you're running pump and dumps, it looks like?
[01:52:03.768 --> 01:52:10.834]  With Jack Dorsey and all this other, it's just like, God Almighty, you people are unbelievable.
[01:52:10.834 --> 01:52:12.695]  You want to sit up there and pontificate about me?
[01:52:14.054 --> 01:52:16.116]  And, oh, agree I should be taken off the air?
[01:52:16.116 --> 01:52:19.998]  Well, thanks for getting my attention.
[01:52:19.998 --> 01:52:27.203]  Because I didn't do this because you ran around trying to put me under the jail.
[01:52:27.203 --> 01:52:28.704]  I did it because you got my attention.
[01:52:28.704 --> 01:52:33.047]  And I started going, whoever's punched me in the nose, I'm like, well, who's that?
[01:52:33.047 --> 01:52:34.408]  I'm like, oh, like a bloodhound.
[01:52:45.583 --> 01:52:47.605]  And now you got me on your tail, see?
[01:52:47.605 --> 01:52:49.447]  I'm a nice guy.
[01:52:49.447 --> 01:52:52.070]  I'm just kind of going to the forest.
[01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:54.592]  Minding my own business.
[01:52:54.592 --> 01:52:57.395]  Like bunny bunny foo foo.
[01:52:57.395 --> 01:52:58.916]  Whacking all the field mice on the head.
[01:52:58.916 --> 01:53:04.402]  And then along comes the big bad wolf and tries to bite me.
[01:53:04.402 --> 01:53:07.105]  I'm like, well big bad wolf?
[01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:17.592]  Think I have to do a bunny bunny fufu.
[01:53:17.592 --> 01:53:23.197]  It's about a 20 foot tall bunny rabbit with big acid fangs dripping, you know.
[01:53:23.197 --> 01:53:24.938]  The wolf always gets scared when you grab by the tail.
[01:53:24.938 --> 01:53:28.701]  It's like, this isn't going to take long here.
[01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:31.804]  And then they always squeal on the way down, but it's okay.
[01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.165]  It's all, it's, I understand.
[01:53:34.165 --> 01:53:38.349]  Listen, it's not till you're in my mouth and I'm chewing on your backbone.
[01:53:40.572 --> 01:53:42.594]  It's always right about the middle vertebrae.
[01:53:42.594 --> 01:53:43.875]  We're like, oh!
[01:53:43.875 --> 01:53:45.977]  It's like, oh, yeah!
[01:53:45.977 --> 01:53:49.039]  You're not scamming your poor little listeners anymore now.
[01:53:49.039 --> 01:53:52.562]  See, this is, this is, this is karmic enforcement.
[01:53:52.562 --> 01:53:54.404]  You're now going into the wood chipper.
[01:53:54.404 --> 01:53:57.586]  Like, see how it feels.
[01:53:57.586 --> 01:54:00.169]  It's fun, fun for you.
[01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:03.191]  Okay, I'll wash my hands now.
[01:54:03.191 --> 01:54:04.492]  At least till the next expose.
[01:54:04.492 --> 01:54:07.254]  But man, wow, you talk about Jack Dorsey.
[01:54:08.089 --> 01:54:25.914]  Running a classic pump-and-dump, not telling people he's pushing products on air and failed securities, that he obviously sold out of, he admits, at the top, bought back into at the bottom, and is trying to literally prey on Joe Rogan's poor audience.
[01:54:25.914 --> 01:54:29.395]  I mean, God Almighty, man!
[01:54:29.395 --> 01:54:32.456]  You know, because this is metaphysical.
[01:54:32.456 --> 01:54:34.297]  When I go back, this guy thought about all the products we sell.
[01:54:35.097 --> 01:54:37.639]  And we need your funding right now, need your support.
[01:54:37.639 --> 01:54:42.863]  And I'm like, you know, the thing I'm most proud of is probably the turmeric, the iodine, or the fish oil.
[01:54:42.863 --> 01:54:46.906]  Plus, I mean, fish oil is just nootropic, heart, brain.
[01:54:46.906 --> 01:54:53.271]  If it's clean, best quality like ours for children and adults, it's just insanely good.
[01:54:53.271 --> 01:54:56.133]  I mean, there's just, there's nothing like it.
[01:54:56.133 --> 01:54:58.955]  And take it in the morning, gives you stamina.
[01:54:58.955 --> 01:55:00.956]  Take it at night, you sleep better, have better dreams.
[01:55:00.956 --> 01:55:01.637]  It's magic!
[01:55:02.856 --> 01:55:04.076]  It's amazing what God gave us.
[01:55:04.076 --> 01:55:10.478]  You know, our coffee, even Vice tested it and said, oh my God, it's really good coffee.
[01:55:10.478 --> 01:55:14.619]  Yeah, it's some of the best Chiapas, best in Guatemala, but it's in Southern Mexico.
[01:55:14.619 --> 01:55:17.439]  It's amazing, super high quality.
[01:55:17.439 --> 01:55:19.940]  But I'm digressing.
[01:55:19.940 --> 01:55:23.641]  What I'm getting at here is, is that I already know I'm under attack.
[01:55:23.641 --> 01:55:29.282]  Plus, I want it to be really good for you, and you want more of it.
[01:55:29.282 --> 01:55:31.903]  Okay, I'm not supposed to do sex analogies because we're a family show,
[01:55:33.783 --> 01:55:41.965]  The point is, is that I want the products we sell to really be great, because that's how I want to be treated.
[01:55:41.965 --> 01:55:43.945]  And I want you to reorder them over and over again.
[01:55:43.945 --> 01:55:50.626]  So get the turmeric, get the X3 iodine, the missing link, get the fish oil.
[01:55:50.626 --> 01:55:56.168]  And we've got big specials we just launched this week that I keep forgetting to tell you about.
[01:55:56.168 --> 01:56:03.289]  50% off our best-selling product, Brain Force Plus, the nootropic that dovetails with Turbo Force.
[01:56:04.775 --> 01:56:08.878]  Which is beyond a pre-workout, beyond a day energy event.
[01:56:08.878 --> 01:56:14.463]  I mean, most people have 10 hours of energy, but not zombie cucks.
[01:56:14.463 --> 01:56:16.644]  This could, you know, be fatal for them.
[01:56:16.644 --> 01:56:21.268]  Fifth, I'm joking, 50% off BrainForce with purchase of TurboForce, and it's 33% off.
[01:56:21.268 --> 01:56:23.910]  So you get a big discount when you get the two together.
[01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:25.111]  They're amazing.
[01:56:25.111 --> 01:56:31.616]  And it has just, it takes time to get into it all, but go to research on TurboForce.
[01:56:31.616 --> 01:56:32.877]  Go to research on TurboForce.
[01:56:35.006 --> 01:56:48.657]  Because I set out with top firms to have the strongest, purest, best, long burn, healthy energy with the amino acids, with the vitamins, with the minerals, with everything in one package.
[01:56:48.657 --> 01:56:57.864]  Because a lot of folks, you know, you take energy drinks and things, it burns out essential vitamins and minerals in the body to transfer it past the blood brain barrier.
[01:56:57.864 --> 01:57:01.427]  When you have all this in one spot together, it's game changing.
[01:57:02.864 --> 01:57:07.108]  Like, I never took money for Bitcoin because I believe it was a pump and dump.
[01:57:07.108 --> 01:57:08.970]  I didn't think the technology itself was a fraud.
[01:57:08.970 --> 01:57:12.214]  And I said, more power to you, but I'm not taking money for it, never did.
[01:57:13.729 --> 01:57:26.892]  But I will take your money all day long for CEQA 12, incredibly high-quality vitamin B12, or for Turbo Force, or for X3, or for any of the products, themforrestore.com, because they're the best out there.
[01:57:26.892 --> 01:57:28.853]  They blow everything away.
[01:57:28.853 --> 01:57:31.714]  Our fluoride-free toothpaste infused with colloidal silver and iodine.
[01:57:31.714 --> 01:57:33.454]  Super Blue, it's amazing as well.
[01:57:33.454 --> 01:57:35.215]  That's 40% off right now.
[01:57:35.215 --> 01:57:36.915]  Big sales just came back.
[01:57:36.915 --> 01:57:37.935]  themforrestore.com.
[01:57:37.935 --> 01:57:40.196]  We need your financial support, or we won't be here.
[01:57:40.897 --> 01:57:42.504]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:57:42.504 --> 01:57:43.670]  I'll give the number out and take your calls.
[01:57:50.051 --> 01:57:53.092]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:57:53.092 --> 01:57:59.535]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:57:59.535 --> 01:58:15.000]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.742]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!
[01:58:20.546 --> 01:58:28.611]  With 14 servings per box for a two week or more supply, this is the formula to stock up on whenever you need a boost.
[01:58:28.611 --> 01:58:35.016]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[01:58:35.016 --> 01:58:37.017]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[01:58:37.017 --> 01:58:39.579]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[01:58:48.355 --> 01:58:52.277]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:58:53.621 --> 01:59:02.304]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:59:02.304 --> 01:59:04.285]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:59:04.285 --> 01:59:07.746]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:59:07.746 --> 01:59:10.367]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:59:10.367 --> 01:59:12.668]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:59:12.668 --> 01:59:19.611]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:59:20.171 --> 01:59:29.959]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:59:29.959 --> 01:59:31.140]  We'll win.
[01:59:31.140 --> 01:59:34.043]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:59:34.043 --> 01:59:41.189]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:44.892]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[01:59:44.892 --> 01:59:46.454]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[01:59:46.454 --> 01:59:47.134]  We need your support.
[01:59:47.134 --> 01:59:47.875]  I'm counting on you.
[01:59:51.298 --> 02:00:02.348]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:02.348 --> 02:00:06.472]  You are either with the Republic or against it.
[02:00:06.472 --> 02:00:10.656]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:10.656 --> 02:00:12.458]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.411 --> 02:00:20.514]  Resentment and nostalgia is not the formula for the middle of the country.
[02:00:20.514 --> 02:00:23.076]  I can't wait to share that with the rest of America.
[02:00:23.076 --> 02:00:24.297]  Julian Castro.
[02:00:24.297 --> 02:00:27.139]  We need universal health care so that everybody can have it.
[02:00:27.139 --> 02:00:28.941]  Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:00:28.941 --> 02:00:33.925]  My record in Congress over the last six years reflects what is in my heart.
[02:00:33.925 --> 02:00:39.389]  A strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ rights.
[02:00:39.389 --> 02:00:40.650]  Cory Booker.
[02:00:40.650 --> 02:00:44.293]  And I understand that the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate.
[02:00:45.242 --> 02:00:55.324]  And if Senator Cornyn believes that I violated Senate rules, I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now.
[02:00:55.324 --> 02:01:06.146]  And I'm releasing it to expose that number one, the emails are being withheld from the public have nothing to do with national security.
[02:01:06.146 --> 02:01:07.986]  Now I appreciate the comments of my colleagues.
[02:01:07.986 --> 02:01:12.287]  This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment.
[02:01:12.287 --> 02:01:13.127]  Elizabeth Ward.
[02:01:13.732 --> 02:01:20.076]  If the question is, can we make the Affordable Care Act better, and we can find some Republican colleagues to do that, absolutely!
[02:01:20.076 --> 02:01:22.577]  We should do what we can to improve it.
[02:01:22.577 --> 02:01:24.298]  Kirsten Gillibrand.
[02:01:24.298 --> 02:01:29.301]  The key issues of her platform are going to make healthcare more equitable, as well as education.
[02:01:29.301 --> 02:01:32.183]  She says she also wants to fight institutional racism.
[02:01:32.183 --> 02:01:35.465]  The NRA has a chokehold on Congress.
[02:01:35.465 --> 02:01:38.166]  The NRA is concerned only with gun sales.
[02:01:38.166 --> 02:01:39.627]  It is literally all about money.
[02:01:39.627 --> 02:01:40.948]  It is all about greed.
[02:01:40.948 --> 02:01:42.709]  It has nothing to do with the Second Amendment.
[02:01:43.171 --> 02:01:44.432]  Kamala Harris.
[02:01:44.432 --> 02:01:56.118]  People in power are trying to convince us that the villain in our American story is each other.
[02:01:56.118 --> 02:01:59.620]  But that is not our story.
[02:01:59.620 --> 02:02:02.822]  That is not who we are.
[02:02:02.822 --> 02:02:05.243]  That is not our America.
[02:02:08.427 --> 02:02:24.809]  These are the names in the Democratic field for president, and they are all under the impression that they are what's right for America, after their party wrote a wave of fake news, bullying the American people and its president, and backing policies of big government handouts.
[02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:28.292]  Do any of them have the support they claim to have?
[02:02:28.292 --> 02:02:41.666]  Current pseudo-frontrunner, Democrat Senator Kamala Harris' presidential announcement received less than a hundred retweets, despite her having a massive following of 2.2 million Twitter users.
[02:02:43.413 --> 02:02:49.217]  From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land.
[02:02:49.217 --> 02:02:53.079]  Of course, all of them will have to contend with the shadow of this man.
[02:02:53.079 --> 02:02:55.821]  And I'm not just talking about President Trump.
[02:02:55.821 --> 02:02:57.442]  They called me Coon Man.
[02:02:57.442 --> 02:03:08.929]  My belief that I did not wear that costume or attend that party stems in part from my clear memory of other mistakes I made in the same period of my life.
[02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:21.658]  That same year, I did participate in a dance contest in San Antonio, in which I darkened my face as part of a Michael Jackson costume.
[02:03:21.658 --> 02:03:27.943]  I look back now and regret that I did not understand the harmful legacy of an action like that.
[02:03:29.182 --> 02:03:36.628]  It is because my memory of that episode is so vivid that I truly do not believe I am in the picture in my yearbook.
[02:03:36.628 --> 02:03:46.776]  While outlier Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is already facing the Democratic mob for potentially dividing the anti-Trump support.
[02:03:46.776 --> 02:03:55.782]  I was a supporter and am a supporter of the Affordable Care Act, which I think can be improved and enhanced so that the premiums come down for families.
[02:03:55.782 --> 02:03:57.464]  Healthcare is a human right!
[02:03:59.085 --> 02:04:04.370]  So I... How dare he's a human right?
[02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:09.314]  How dare he's a human right?
[02:04:09.314 --> 02:04:11.976]  In any event... How dare he's a human right?
[02:04:11.976 --> 02:04:25.548]  Perhaps creepy uncle Joe Biden or even national security threat numero uno Hillary Clinton will ride into the rescue on their platforms of sheer bulls**t. But it's still too early to tell.
[02:04:25.548 --> 02:04:26.789]  John Bowne reporting.
[02:04:28.399 --> 02:04:34.282]  The toll-free number to join us when we come back is 877-789-2539.
[02:04:34.282 --> 02:04:35.563]  877-789-Alex.
[02:04:35.563 --> 02:04:39.785]  That's 877-789-Alex.
[02:04:39.785 --> 02:04:40.505]  877-789-2539.
[02:04:40.505 --> 02:04:44.287]  And then we've got a bunch of news I have not hit yet.
[02:04:44.287 --> 02:04:46.269]  European women now wearing hijabs.
[02:04:46.269 --> 02:04:52.012]  Mainstream news reports out of sheer protection from the Islamic rape gang.
[02:04:52.012 --> 02:04:53.773]  How dare them be anti-Islamic?
[02:04:53.773 --> 02:04:54.353]  What the hell?
[02:05:05.598 --> 02:05:14.621]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:05:14.621 --> 02:05:24.685]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:24.685 --> 02:05:33.228]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:34.048 --> 02:05:35.409]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:05:35.409 --> 02:05:36.569]  You must experience it.
[02:05:36.569 --> 02:05:43.553]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.553 --> 02:05:45.074]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:45.074 --> 02:05:46.555]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:05:46.555 --> 02:05:53.258]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:05:53.258 --> 02:05:54.739]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com
[02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:17.335]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:17.335 --> 02:06:23.581]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.581 --> 02:06:26.403]  You know, moments of my broadcast every day are pretty powerful.
[02:06:26.403 --> 02:06:27.524]  We have some great guests on.
[02:06:27.524 --> 02:06:33.470]  Gav McGinnis, who's filed suit against the Southern Poverty Law Center for trying to destroy his life and his family's life and lying about it.
[02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:35.272]  He was on there in the first 30 minutes.
[02:06:36.345 --> 02:06:45.030]  But even if you're sick of my pontification, which I get sick of sometimes, we have some amazing reporters, some amazing journalists, some amazing pundits, and one of them is John Bowne.
[02:06:46.681 --> 02:06:55.028]  They put a report together that's up on InfoWars.com that really deserves for unborn children and everybody else to get out there.
[02:06:55.028 --> 02:06:57.089]  And only with you getting it out will people see it.
[02:06:57.089 --> 02:07:06.156]  So we'll play this report and then go right back to your phone calls and other breaking news and the latest on the Virginia governor and the canard that that idiot
[02:07:07.077 --> 02:07:10.119]  That organ harvester, that's really what this is all about.
[02:07:10.119 --> 02:07:14.321]  They had those yearbooks on him years ago as blackmail.
[02:07:14.321 --> 02:07:19.304]  He got caught admitting they're killing babies after birth, that's why he's gotta go.
[02:07:19.304 --> 02:07:20.704]  So the rest of the story on that coming up.
[02:07:20.704 --> 02:07:21.985]  But first, John Bowne's report.
[02:07:21.985 --> 02:07:24.746]  It's on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[02:07:24.746 --> 02:07:26.287]  Please go get it, get it out.
[02:07:26.287 --> 02:07:30.790]  Satanist Democrats and Socialists, a cancer on American morality.
[02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:31.370]  Here's the report.
[02:07:32.037 --> 02:07:37.060]  Benjamin Franklin prescribed this for our nation back in 1778, saying, Today, we are plagued by a volatile Marxist generation
[02:07:52.327 --> 02:08:08.861]  Rejecting the founding father's quest for individual liberty, the idiocy of anti-morality has flared up as a generation of cowards embrace a culture of selfishness that mocks the selflessness of previous American generations while murdering future generations.
[02:08:08.861 --> 02:08:10.162]  So in this particular example,
[02:08:10.162 --> 02:08:12.184]  Do you regret what you said yesterday or the way you said it?
[02:08:31.821 --> 02:08:32.461]  No, I don't.
[02:08:32.461 --> 02:08:35.503]  And you know, Alan, I appreciate the question.
[02:08:35.503 --> 02:08:36.683]  I'm a physician.
[02:08:36.683 --> 02:08:42.626]  In the midst of this, Northam's racist past is used against not just him, but all of us.
[02:08:42.626 --> 02:08:48.188]  A media circus created to distract from the original evil post-birth abortion controversy.
[02:08:48.188 --> 02:08:51.230]  A topic the mainstream media won't fully address.
[02:08:51.230 --> 02:08:54.511]  I take credit for recognizing that this was a horrific
[02:08:54.591 --> 02:08:54.831]  I think?
[02:09:11.097 --> 02:09:18.499]  I had the shoes, I had a glove, and I used just a little bit of shoe polish to put under my, or on my cheeks.
[02:09:18.499 --> 02:09:23.400]  On January 22nd, New York Governor Cuomo signed the reproductive health care law.
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:24.740]  Yeah, hit pause right there.
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:26.541]  Back it up five seconds.
[02:09:26.541 --> 02:09:35.803]  When you look in Virginia, when they had the debate about killing babies after they're born, these women are licking their lips and getting their skins getting rid of them.
[02:09:38.587 --> 02:09:40.429]  We gonna kill them!
[02:09:40.429 --> 02:09:46.014]  And then you look at Cuomo and them, I mean, they are just like... These are demons, folks.
[02:09:46.014 --> 02:09:50.018]  And the devil's just raining them with satanic delight right now.
[02:09:50.018 --> 02:09:52.641]  It's just like, we have the Holy Spirit, they have the devil spirit.
[02:09:53.493 --> 02:09:57.334]  And if you watch him, he said, we're gonna kill babies after they're born.
[02:09:57.334 --> 02:09:59.915]  He's so liberal!
[02:09:59.915 --> 02:10:02.576]  He's so good!
[02:10:02.576 --> 02:10:03.436]  So let's go back to it.
[02:10:03.436 --> 02:10:04.356]  Here it is.
[02:10:04.356 --> 02:10:09.117]  On January 22nd, New York Governor Cuomo signed the Reproductive Health Act.
[02:10:09.117 --> 02:10:12.278]  I'm sorry, pause again.
[02:10:12.278 --> 02:10:13.078]  Put them back on.
[02:10:13.078 --> 02:10:15.239]  Can you imagine being these people?
[02:10:15.239 --> 02:10:18.340]  Because let me tell you, you're talking
[02:10:19.588 --> 02:10:21.069]  Especially when it's only a few states doing it.
[02:10:21.069 --> 02:10:25.592]  We're talking hundreds of millions of dollars in organs.
[02:10:25.592 --> 02:10:28.314]  And this is just like, all right.
[02:10:28.314 --> 02:10:29.195]  Ooh, yeah.
[02:10:29.195 --> 02:10:33.598]  Look at that weirdo lady sitting there, blue outfit and all the rest of these people.
[02:10:33.598 --> 02:10:39.042]  I mean, this is just a sick group of ghouls.
[02:10:39.042 --> 02:10:42.684]  America will never be great and never been great.
[02:10:42.684 --> 02:10:44.446]  My name Cuomo.
[02:10:46.485 --> 02:10:51.989]  If you're Christian or gun owner, you're not welcome.
[02:10:51.989 --> 02:10:58.994]  White people do not know what it's like to be poor.
[02:10:58.994 --> 02:11:02.396]  Imagine if you were a jellyfish like these people.
[02:11:02.396 --> 02:11:03.337]  Spawn of Satan.
[02:11:03.337 --> 02:11:10.381]  And they're always like... I mean, even if you're gonna kill babies after they're born, you should be solemn about it.
[02:11:10.381 --> 02:11:15.165]  Instead of like... Here, let's go back to it.
[02:11:15.165 --> 02:11:15.485]  Here it is.
[02:11:16.027 --> 02:11:21.651]  On January 22nd, New York Governor Cuomo signed the Reproductive Health Care Act.
[02:11:21.651 --> 02:11:22.212]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[02:11:22.212 --> 02:11:24.354]  Because see, to them it's an affront to God.
[02:11:24.354 --> 02:11:30.178]  It's like, we're gonna kill these babies, we're gonna make money, and they're like, woo!
[02:11:30.178 --> 02:11:31.459]  Yeah!
[02:11:31.459 --> 02:11:34.461]  Yeah!
[02:11:34.461 --> 02:11:38.144]  It's the Governor Cuomo experience.
[02:11:38.144 --> 02:11:38.805]  Sorry, let's go back now.
[02:11:39.545 --> 02:11:52.678]  On January 22nd, New York Governor Cuomo signed the Reproductive Health Care Act into law, which expanded the circumstances... I'm telling you, that woman, that satanism writ large.
[02:11:52.678 --> 02:11:54.460]  I mean, if you're a TV viewer, you're seeing it.
[02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:55.421]  Radio listeners can't see this.
[02:11:55.421 --> 02:12:01.006]  I mean, these people are... Well, it's satanism.
[02:12:01.006 --> 02:12:01.647]  Back it up again.
[02:12:01.647 --> 02:12:02.908]  You want to see satanism?
[02:12:03.959 --> 02:12:06.240]  Like they're reveling in the defeat of innocence.
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:09.980]  They're reveling in just all of it.
[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.461]  This is an ecstasy moment right now.
[02:12:12.461 --> 02:12:15.222]  Let's continue.
[02:12:15.222 --> 02:12:19.663]  ...can legally obtain an abortion, including up until the moment of birth.
[02:12:19.663 --> 02:12:24.384]  And on January 28th, the Virginia legislature introduced a similar bill.
[02:12:24.384 --> 02:12:30.005]  The mainstream media will simply not address the established aborted baby market, one that
[02:12:30.265 --> 02:12:35.649]  Planned Parenthood, which is heavily supported by George Soros, has been actively involved in.
[02:12:35.649 --> 02:12:52.360]  As two of Planned Parenthood's business partners, Da Vinci Biosciences and DV Biologics, have admitted guilt in a $7.8 million settlement with the Orange County District Attorney for selling aborted baby body parts from Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties.
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:53.821]  Hey, pause again!
[02:12:53.821 --> 02:12:55.363]  That's why they're so pissed.
[02:12:55.363 --> 02:12:56.804]  This is just one county.
[02:12:56.804 --> 02:12:58.465]  They're selling organs everywhere.
[02:12:59.531 --> 02:13:04.156]  Some people are making two, three million dollars a year as doctors, nurses, making 300 grand.
[02:13:04.156 --> 02:13:09.401]  So they need to get laws passed to keep them alive, because you want to keep them alive a few days.
[02:13:09.401 --> 02:13:14.345]  Mama, we kept them alive, they're comfortable, like the governor said.
[02:13:14.345 --> 02:13:16.007]  And then once that's going on,
[02:13:17.148 --> 02:13:20.569]  They can keep them alive until they get that broker and get the price up.
[02:13:20.569 --> 02:13:23.430]  It's got a $300,000, $500,000, $600,000.
[02:13:23.430 --> 02:13:25.570]  So see, that's what they're laughing like.
[02:13:25.570 --> 02:13:28.451]  Bitches, you think we're going to stop killing kids?
[02:13:28.451 --> 02:13:29.551]  Woo!
[02:13:29.551 --> 02:13:32.412]  We just legalized child sacrifice!
[02:13:32.412 --> 02:13:33.932]  Woo!
[02:13:33.932 --> 02:13:34.833]  Yeah!
[02:13:34.833 --> 02:13:35.493]  Let's go back.
[02:13:36.444 --> 02:13:46.570]  ...from Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino Counties for profit in violation of federal and California law as reported by the Center for Medical Progress.
[02:13:46.570 --> 02:13:50.892]  Aborted baby's bodies are a very valuable commodity in today's America.
[02:13:50.892 --> 02:13:56.896]  Research institutions, elite universities, medical centers pay a lot of money for baby parts.
[02:13:57.897 --> 02:14:06.446]  I find myself in complete shock saying that on television in America in 2019, but you can buy the arms and legs and skin of babies today.
[02:14:06.446 --> 02:14:14.255]  While Lucian Greaves of the Satanic Temple is given a soapbox after being the subject of a recent Hollywood documentary praising him,
[02:14:14.315 --> 02:14:29.238]  Well, the first Satanic Temple action that I heard of was definitely the Baphomet campaign in Oklahoma, when they were fundraising to make this eight-and-a-half-foot-tall, bronze, you know, goat-headed deity called Baphomet.
[02:14:29.238 --> 02:14:31.798]  And, you know, I thought it was brilliant.
[02:14:31.798 --> 02:14:37.580]  Like many people who saw that story and those headlines and that campaign, you know... Look how pathetic those morons are.
[02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:39.840]  ...it made me think, and I thought it was really smart.
[02:14:40.060 --> 02:14:45.621]  Greaves is preaching an irrational fear of Vice President Pence to a generation of swine.
[02:14:45.621 --> 02:14:48.282]  Greaves said, Trump is too stupid to predict.
[02:14:48.282 --> 02:14:50.983]  The guy has no concept of his own limitations.
[02:14:50.983 --> 02:14:55.564]  The thing that makes me most uncomfortable with Trump is the fact that he has no vision.
[02:14:55.564 --> 02:14:59.425]  Mike Pence really scares me, Greaves told the Daily Beast.
[02:14:59.425 --> 02:15:02.786]  Pence has a clear, theocratic vision for the United States.
[02:15:03.166 --> 02:15:08.510]  How do those themes around Satan and Satanism resonate right now?
[02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:16.956]  For me, it seems kind of obvious that there's been a complete reversal in the roles of who's ostensibly the good guys and who are the bad guys.
[02:15:16.956 --> 02:15:24.082]  Right now we have evangelical nationalists pushing a theocratic agenda in the United States and making great headway.
[02:15:24.742 --> 02:15:27.964]  To take away people's reproductive rights.
[02:15:27.964 --> 02:15:30.925]  The United States is dangerously demoralized.
[02:15:30.925 --> 02:15:42.010]  When a governor attempts to legalize the murder of living, breathing citizens, and the public is manipulated to support the concerns of the satanic temple, there's no other way but up.
[02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:43.471]  John Bowne reporting.

[02:16:55.376 --> 02:16:56.577]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.577 --> 02:17:00.499]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.499 --> 02:17:02.040]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:05.002]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:05.002 --> 02:17:10.565]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.565 --> 02:17:11.765]  I can help you, too.

[02:17:14.707 --> 02:17:16.928]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:17:59.048 --> 02:18:02.069]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[02:18:02.069 --> 02:18:08.510]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[02:18:08.510 --> 02:18:23.974]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[02:18:56.132 --> 02:19:06.719]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.719 --> 02:19:08.800]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:11.662]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[02:19:11.662 --> 02:19:13.143]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.143 --> 02:19:19.967]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:19.967 --> 02:19:21.248]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[02:19:22.048 --> 02:19:31.755]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.755 --> 02:19:48.567]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[02:19:51.889 --> 02:19:58.821]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:19:58.821 --> 02:20:01.445]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.056 --> 02:20:24.317]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:27.153 --> 02:20:29.414]  We'll continue with your calls in the next hour.
[02:20:29.414 --> 02:20:31.234]  We have a guest host joining us.
[02:20:31.234 --> 02:20:34.535]  And we've got Dan Lyman popping in with huge developments in Europe in the next segment.
[02:20:34.535 --> 02:20:36.776]  We're on your calls right now.
[02:20:36.776 --> 02:20:39.157]  Let's go to Carter in Texas.
[02:20:39.157 --> 02:20:49.160]  Wants to talk Joe Rogan and the apparent pump and dump he's running for Bitcoin and Jack Dorsey without telling his viewers that they're major sponsors of his.
[02:20:49.160 --> 02:20:51.260]  DMT called Satanic Connection.
[02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:52.281]  Carter, thanks for holding.
[02:20:52.281 --> 02:20:53.601]  You're on the air.
[02:20:53.601 --> 02:20:55.482]  Yes, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:20:55.482 --> 02:20:56.302]  I'd like to ask
[02:20:57.267 --> 02:21:00.769]  What is the relationship between this psychedelic DMT?
[02:21:00.769 --> 02:21:07.593]  There's the cults you've been talking about, the state standard bloodlines, the European World Tea, Silicon Valley in China.
[02:21:07.593 --> 02:21:09.974]  I mean, what is the connection between all of these things?
[02:21:09.974 --> 02:21:13.356]  I'd really like to get your angle on that.
[02:21:13.356 --> 02:21:15.237]  Well, Carter, yeah, exactly.
[02:21:15.237 --> 02:21:16.978]  My angle, I don't have the definitive answer.
[02:21:16.978 --> 02:21:17.939]  My angle would be...
[02:21:19.878 --> 02:21:31.728]  The so-called elites just don't have a conscience or soul, or they've lost it, and they're constantly taking hardcore drugs to kill their humanity and give them connection to lower energy, lower dimensions.
[02:21:31.728 --> 02:21:32.789]  That's what they believe.
[02:21:32.789 --> 02:21:37.293]  I'm not going off what I believe, but if you actually look at that template, the Bible's deadly accurate.
[02:21:37.293 --> 02:21:41.977]  And so they're trying to hypnotize people and get them under their control for dominion
[02:21:43.378 --> 02:21:46.539]  And they're really just fallen individuals.
[02:21:46.539 --> 02:21:58.784]  But Jack Dorsey, the whole San Francisco IT cult, is on record being obsessed with drugs and trying to contact interdimensional entities.
[02:21:58.784 --> 02:22:00.025]  That's their religion.
[02:22:01.462 --> 02:22:05.663]  Now, are those interdimensional entities, I mean, are they the Bible?
[02:22:05.663 --> 02:22:09.364]  Are they the demons that were spoken in the Bible?
[02:22:09.364 --> 02:22:10.584]  I mean... Well, absolutely.
[02:22:10.584 --> 02:22:12.285]  The Bible's been proven.
[02:22:12.285 --> 02:22:13.085]  The Bible's been proven.
[02:22:13.085 --> 02:22:16.566]  And by the way, atheism isn't even taught in college now, hardly.
[02:22:16.566 --> 02:22:20.767]  All the big billionaires are like, oh, there's other dimensions, we're gonna merge with machines.
[02:22:20.767 --> 02:22:23.087]  Oh, there's aliens helping us, we're gonna merge with them.
[02:22:23.087 --> 02:22:23.867]  I'm not into all that.
[02:22:23.867 --> 02:22:25.148]  I'm not taking the drugs.
[02:22:25.148 --> 02:22:26.268]  I'm not involved.
[02:22:26.268 --> 02:22:28.088]  The point is, they believe in that.
[02:22:28.088 --> 02:22:29.609]  And so, that's what they're doing.
[02:22:29.609 --> 02:22:30.229]  I appreciate your call.
[02:22:33.834 --> 02:22:35.375]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jessica.
[02:22:35.375 --> 02:22:37.215]  She was talking about the Virginia governor.
[02:22:37.215 --> 02:22:38.116]  Jessica, you're on the air.
[02:22:38.116 --> 02:22:39.936]  Looks like he'll be resigning soon.
[02:22:39.936 --> 02:22:42.197]  What do you think?
[02:22:42.197 --> 02:22:44.338]  I hope so.
[02:22:44.338 --> 02:22:46.239]  I never liked him from the beginning.
[02:22:46.239 --> 02:22:51.201]  I remember that President Obama endorsed him.
[02:22:51.201 --> 02:22:55.963]  And that was a big, I thought that would be a big wake-up call to people, but apparently it wasn't.
[02:22:57.940 --> 02:23:00.101]  But we keep the babies comfortable.
[02:23:00.101 --> 02:23:04.363]  I can't really do his fake Southern accent, but it's just... I love Southerners.
[02:23:04.363 --> 02:23:13.467]  I'm from Texas, kind of Southern, but it's like the fakeness of that sicky sweet, let's stay out of the ladies area and kill that baby.
[02:23:13.467 --> 02:23:18.129]  I think because he's a pediatrician, he's used to people...
[02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:28.165]  You know, kind of responding to that voice he does, but it sickens me that he's a pediatrician and he's pushing what he's pushing.
[02:23:28.165 --> 02:23:32.107]  But we're going to make the baby comfortable.
[02:23:32.107 --> 02:23:33.788]  Oh, my gosh, it's so sickening.
[02:23:33.788 --> 02:23:41.813]  But I mean, I'll be honest, I don't wish any violence upon him, but I just can't help wanting to get my hands around his neck when he talks.
[02:23:41.813 --> 02:23:43.154]  I completely understand.
[02:23:43.154 --> 02:23:45.396]  But I pray for him as I do all these.
[02:23:46.636 --> 02:23:50.838]  These sick people have been, like, completely lied to by the enemy.
[02:23:50.838 --> 02:23:51.538]  No, I agree.
[02:23:51.538 --> 02:23:57.941]  But you get, though, for the enemy, it's next level for him to, like, I don't apologize.
[02:23:57.941 --> 02:23:59.761]  We're gonna kill the baby.
[02:23:59.761 --> 02:24:01.622]  I mean, it's sick.
[02:24:01.622 --> 02:24:04.303]  Well, we know in the end times this is the stuff that happens.
[02:24:04.303 --> 02:24:11.806]  That's why I'm so, um, I'm so proud of you and the InfoWars team for all that you do.
[02:24:11.806 --> 02:24:14.367]  And I love, I wanted to say I love your products.
[02:24:14.367 --> 02:24:14.808]  I have XQ.
[02:24:16.132 --> 02:24:20.476]  And the selenium for my thyroid and I have to say that it's worked wonders.
[02:24:20.476 --> 02:24:22.798]  The Brain Force Plus is amazing.
[02:24:22.798 --> 02:24:41.674]  Me and my family take it every day and I mean you really can feel what it does and usually I get a lot of brain fog from the thyroid issue and that helps tremendously and the knockout helps me sleep at night, especially when I have something important I have to get up and do in the morning and I don't feel that groggy feeling.
[02:24:42.372 --> 02:24:43.633]  And we use the toothpaste.
[02:24:43.633 --> 02:24:44.954]  We love the toothpaste.
[02:24:44.954 --> 02:24:49.536]  My son uses the krill oil for some issues that he deals with.
[02:24:49.536 --> 02:24:52.738]  My husband is a hardwood floor installer.
[02:24:52.738 --> 02:24:57.802]  He loves the bodies and he loves the Red Pill Plus.
[02:24:57.802 --> 02:25:00.263]  And we're going to try the Turbo Force next.
[02:25:00.263 --> 02:25:07.307]  I really want to get that Turbo Force because my son loves going to the gym and he needs something for a boost.
[02:25:07.307 --> 02:25:09.809]  Well, Jessica, I appreciate your support, but let me be honest with you.
[02:25:11.542 --> 02:25:16.406]  I looked up a couple years ago and I said, what's the number one thing in markets we need to fund ourselves with good products?
[02:25:16.406 --> 02:25:22.931]  And all the market research said, pre-workout or long-lasting energy drink that isn't toxic.
[02:25:22.931 --> 02:25:24.272]  So I went to three big developers.
[02:25:24.272 --> 02:25:27.054]  I had to pay one of them a lot of money for their formula.
[02:25:27.054 --> 02:25:32.978]  And of course, they don't want to be connected to us, so I can't say it on air, but it's one of the top manufacturers in the country.
[02:25:32.978 --> 02:25:34.760]  They said, okay, if people spent money,
[02:25:36.018 --> 02:25:36.078]  Yes.
[02:25:57.012 --> 02:25:59.254]  And 10 hours later was bouncing off the wall.
[02:25:59.254 --> 02:26:01.715]  So it's very powerful.
[02:26:01.715 --> 02:26:05.498]  I'm not saying I'm embarrassed to put this out because it's overall, I think it's good for you.
[02:26:05.498 --> 02:26:08.260]  And like you said, get in the gym, energy, business.
[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:12.323]  It's just it's kind of like good crack.
[02:26:12.323 --> 02:26:14.784]  So I'm almost embarrassed.
[02:26:14.784 --> 02:26:16.405]  Everybody should be careful with it.
[02:26:16.405 --> 02:26:17.186]  It's the next level.
[02:26:17.186 --> 02:26:19.448]  It's insane.
[02:26:19.448 --> 02:26:24.171]  I really am glad that I'm able to help the fight for
[02:26:24.821 --> 02:26:27.283]  Truth and, and freedom and liberty.
[02:26:27.283 --> 02:26:36.329]  And I don't know what, where I would be and what I would think if I didn't have people like you on air who have just stayed strong through it all.
[02:26:36.329 --> 02:26:43.193]  So I just want to encourage you just to keep going, keep fighting for us and with us, because I don't know.
[02:26:43.193 --> 02:26:45.195]  I don't know what we would do.
[02:26:45.195 --> 02:26:47.396]  We wouldn't have anybody if there wasn't you.
[02:26:47.396 --> 02:26:50.438]  I mean, I don't know that anybody else would be on the air doing it.
[02:26:50.438 --> 02:26:52.540]  You're like you said, you're the tip of the spear.
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:53.080]  So it really.
[02:26:53.618 --> 02:26:58.643]  I appreciate you and what you say, you know, helps me stay connected to the truth.
[02:26:58.643 --> 02:27:04.209]  It helps me stay connected to God and I can't say enough about how much I love
[02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:10.494]  Info Wars, how much I love the products, but I would like to have some female cut shirts.
[02:27:10.494 --> 02:27:11.775]  Some more options.
[02:27:11.775 --> 02:27:13.797]  No, no, I totally agree.
[02:27:13.797 --> 02:27:18.220]  We put out the one gold foil female shirt, it was a big hit, and we're just brain dead.
[02:27:18.220 --> 02:27:24.345]  But I promise, that's our number one complaint, is from women, we've only got a couple shirts that are cut for females, we will get it done for you.
[02:27:24.345 --> 02:27:34.173]  But Jessica, you give me strength to go on, and your husband, and your family, because just hearing what's in your voice, the powerful feminine energy, and then the male energy together,
[02:27:34.813 --> 02:27:43.656]  All of us focused together against the globalists is unstoppable, and that's why they're attacking that sacred system of the family, of all of us together.
[02:27:43.656 --> 02:27:44.896]  We are humanity.
[02:27:44.896 --> 02:27:45.877]  We are the experience.
[02:27:45.877 --> 02:27:47.077]  We are everything.
[02:27:47.077 --> 02:27:49.438]  And so you just got my commitment to fight on, but let me tell you.
[02:27:49.938 --> 02:27:51.200]  I'm obnoxious most of the time.
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:52.101]  I'm burnt out.
[02:27:52.101 --> 02:27:52.821]  Hearing you.
[02:27:52.821 --> 02:27:54.083]  I want to just say this.
[02:27:54.083 --> 02:27:55.384]  I'm not just telling you this.
[02:27:55.384 --> 02:27:56.606]  You are the info war.
[02:27:56.606 --> 02:27:58.448]  You're the power of the whole thing.
[02:27:58.448 --> 02:28:02.893]  And that's why I get so freaked out about begging the audience for help because it's the truth.
[02:28:02.893 --> 02:28:04.294]  I mean, I'm not just saying it.
[02:28:04.294 --> 02:28:08.018]  If you weren't here, it's obvious, but it's so real.
[02:28:08.018 --> 02:28:08.879]  If you weren't here,
[02:28:09.480 --> 02:28:12.282]  Standing in the way, they would have already destroyed me.
[02:28:12.282 --> 02:28:13.783]  But we're in this together.
[02:28:13.783 --> 02:28:16.025]  So God bless you, Jessica from Virginia.
[02:28:16.025 --> 02:28:21.990]  And yeah, looking at that little pathetic gremlin governor and his little... Of course he's KKK.
[02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:25.012]  Who do you think these... Who the hell wants to harvest babies' organs?
[02:28:25.012 --> 02:28:26.873]  That's what that's all really about.
[02:28:26.873 --> 02:28:28.595]  These are demons.
[02:28:28.595 --> 02:28:30.176]  But thanks to you and others, we're going to win.
[02:28:30.176 --> 02:28:31.877]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:31.877 --> 02:28:32.938]  Wow.
[02:28:32.938 --> 02:28:34.960]  Powerful call.
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:35.480]  Powerful.
[02:28:36.678 --> 02:28:37.819]  All right!
[02:28:37.819 --> 02:28:40.763]  We got Dan Lyman popping in for like a segment or two, but I'm going to continue in the next hour.
[02:28:40.763 --> 02:28:43.426]  I know I have a special guest showing up at the office.
[02:28:43.426 --> 02:28:46.249]  Andrel Salente is about to take over.
[02:28:46.249 --> 02:28:50.914]  I'm going to get all the callers.
[02:28:50.914 --> 02:28:51.955]  All and others when we come back.
[02:28:51.955 --> 02:28:52.295]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.168 --> 02:28:57.530]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.530 --> 02:29:00.412]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:29:00.412 --> 02:29:05.496]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.496 --> 02:29:12.681]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.681 --> 02:29:17.225]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.825 --> 02:29:21.448]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.448 --> 02:29:24.591]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.591 --> 02:29:27.213]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.213 --> 02:29:28.714]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.714 --> 02:29:32.057]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.

[02:30:05.663 --> 02:30:14.666]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:30:14.666 --> 02:30:24.748]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:30:24.748 --> 02:30:33.271]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:30:34.111 --> 02:30:35.452]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:30:35.452 --> 02:30:36.613]  You must experience it.
[02:30:36.613 --> 02:30:43.618]  It is a total game changer when it comes to easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:30:43.618 --> 02:30:45.139]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:30:45.139 --> 02:30:46.621]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:30:46.621 --> 02:30:53.306]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[02:33:07.654 --> 02:33:11.118]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:11.118 --> 02:33:15.945]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:33.865 --> 02:33:46.669]  Alright, we got a load of phone lines, and Gerald Slotnick's coming up, and I've got Dan Lyman, EuropeWars.com's great editor-in-chief joining us, because there's so much news, but Sharia law is here.
[02:33:46.669 --> 02:33:50.991]  Swimming pools across the country have whole days that are closed, so the Muslims can have people wear
[02:33:52.815 --> 02:34:04.889]  Uh, burkinis, we've got school lunches having to be halal, and now a Muslim patrol group in New York faces backlash, including far-right conspiracy theorists.
[02:34:04.889 --> 02:34:11.196]  So, you're a conspiracy theorist and it says, Muslim Community Patrol, and looks just like a police car.
[02:34:11.196 --> 02:34:12.678]  Scroll down so TV viewers can see it.
[02:34:15.478 --> 02:34:17.600]  New York Muslims have a new security patrol.
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:20.262]  I'm sorry, this is getting more and more insane.
[02:34:20.262 --> 02:34:21.743]  Meanwhile, Austria.
[02:34:21.743 --> 02:34:26.648]  White girls wearing headscarves to prevent harassment from Muslim migrants.
[02:34:26.648 --> 02:34:29.971]  That's all up on InfoWars.com and PresidentPlanet.com.
[02:34:29.971 --> 02:34:32.693]  We're going to go to Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com in just a moment.
[02:34:32.693 --> 02:34:36.316]  But going back to the calls real fast, Frank in North Carolina.
[02:34:36.316 --> 02:34:37.157]  We'll go to you in a moment.
[02:34:37.157 --> 02:34:39.099]  First, Paul in New Jersey.
[02:34:39.699 --> 02:34:48.568]  Paul, I went on a jag today about Joe Rogan and Jack Dorsey because Jack Dorsey's his biggest sponsor, pays for all the Bitcoin pump and dumping, all the products they promote.
[02:34:48.568 --> 02:34:53.433]  They don't even tell you when they're on there promoting it that Jack Dorsey owns it.
[02:34:53.433 --> 02:34:54.635]  Very unethical.
[02:34:54.635 --> 02:34:57.237]  I think it's securities and exchange commission violation.
[02:34:57.237 --> 02:34:57.558]  Go ahead.
[02:34:58.701 --> 02:35:01.624]  Oh, you're getting me started going here, but I want to start with Alex.
[02:35:01.624 --> 02:35:05.347]  I'm a big fan, and I just want to say what a class operation you run.
[02:35:05.347 --> 02:35:07.809]  The guy on the phone couldn't have been a better gentleman.
[02:35:07.809 --> 02:35:09.670]  This is my first time calling.
[02:35:09.670 --> 02:35:15.135]  I've been listening since 2013, and I mean, where do we start with Joe Rogan?
[02:35:15.135 --> 02:35:15.775]  I'll tell you something.
[02:35:15.775 --> 02:35:23.782]  My father, my father immigrated here in 51 from war-torn Germany, and I was in his hip pocket my whole life listening to everything he said.
[02:35:24.608 --> 02:35:29.211]  And, um, tough guy, Vietnam vet, and he always warned me, guys, like Joe Rogan.
[02:35:29.211 --> 02:35:30.371]  He called them chameleons.
[02:35:30.371 --> 02:35:31.732]  Okay?
[02:35:31.732 --> 02:35:40.817]  Not necessarily every kid that's bullied, you know, is a bad kid or whatever, but it's so... it's so more common in these kids.
[02:35:40.817 --> 02:35:41.938]  No, you're right.
[02:35:41.938 --> 02:35:43.619]  Joe is a chameleon.
[02:35:43.619 --> 02:35:46.861]  He's whatever you want him to be, but he's a predator.
[02:35:46.861 --> 02:35:47.801]  Exactly.
[02:35:47.801 --> 02:35:48.322]  Exactly.
[02:35:48.322 --> 02:35:49.843]  I mean, he talks about bullying.
[02:35:49.843 --> 02:35:50.923]  Oh, I was bullied.
[02:35:50.923 --> 02:35:53.785]  My family, I mean, whatever godless people, you know,
[02:35:55.094 --> 02:35:59.235]  You know, uh, took care of that kid as a, as a child, but took them all over the country.
[02:35:59.235 --> 02:36:01.716]  They were hippies, whatever he, he claims they were.
[02:36:01.716 --> 02:36:05.517]  But, I mean, you look at, he talks about bullying.
[02:36:05.517 --> 02:36:09.559]  This guy made his comedic bones by bullying Carlos Mencia.
[02:36:09.559 --> 02:36:11.499]  Now, I'm not a fan of Carlos Mencia.
[02:36:11.499 --> 02:36:17.161]  No, but Joe takes everybody else's content and he exactly, he claims, he claims other people are, like Dennis Leary.
[02:36:18.092 --> 02:36:19.073]  Exactly.
[02:36:19.073 --> 02:36:21.874]  I mean, it's easy to say somebody's a fraud.
[02:36:21.874 --> 02:36:24.535]  It's just a real quick general word, blah, blah, blah.
[02:36:24.535 --> 02:36:31.799]  But, I mean, I've actually studied Rogan now, and my first episode I ever watched was 9-11 with you.
[02:36:31.799 --> 02:36:35.161]  And I'm not saying it changed my life, but let me tell you something.
[02:36:35.161 --> 02:36:46.427]  I was woke up, and after that episode, slowly, the process of him picking you apart, guest by guest, was just unbelievable.
[02:36:46.427 --> 02:36:47.107]  And then he's saying,
[02:36:47.662 --> 02:36:48.302]  We're friends.
[02:36:48.302 --> 02:36:48.942]  I love Alex.
[02:36:48.942 --> 02:36:50.123]  He's a great guy.
[02:36:50.123 --> 02:36:51.583]  I mean, how?
[02:36:51.583 --> 02:37:02.105]  I don't even understand, but then I hear today you're saying he's making $300,000 a month from Jack Dorsey, that godless, soulless, what the bot, whatever that is.
[02:37:02.105 --> 02:37:06.766]  But now it makes sense, because power corrupts and absolute power corrupts.
[02:37:06.766 --> 02:37:07.426]  Absolutely.
[02:37:07.426 --> 02:37:11.247]  So with that kind of money, I mean, it's up for grabs, Joe.
[02:37:11.247 --> 02:37:13.548]  I mean, I'm sorry, Alex.
[02:37:13.548 --> 02:37:14.168]  I apologize.
[02:37:14.693 --> 02:37:15.594]  No, I was just talking about Joe.
[02:37:15.594 --> 02:37:22.482]  And that's the thing, I don't want to just sit here and attack Joe, but I'm not going to sit here and say, looks like a pump and dump, looks like a scam, oh but I love Joe.
[02:37:22.482 --> 02:37:23.182]  No, I don't love Joe.
[02:37:24.396 --> 02:37:30.999]  I mean, in fact, I'm mad that I was, like, not paying attention and realized what a monster he is, and how he preys on his audience.
[02:37:30.999 --> 02:37:33.399]  You know, if I'm selling a product, I tell you what it is.
[02:37:33.399 --> 02:37:49.546]  His whole show, the shirts he wears, the drinks he has, everything he does, and then he, oh, but he's not selling nothing to nobody, and he's up there promoting securities without telling people that his sponsor is the pusher of the securities.
[02:37:49.546 --> 02:37:52.026]  That's illegal, period.
[02:37:52.026 --> 02:37:53.287]  But again, he's protected.
[02:37:54.631 --> 02:37:55.251]  Exactly.
[02:37:55.251 --> 02:37:59.454]  Hey, his whole career was brought up against censorship.
[02:37:59.454 --> 02:38:00.714]  We can't censor this.
[02:38:00.714 --> 02:38:04.677]  His favorite comedians, Kinnison, Hicks, George Carlin.
[02:38:04.677 --> 02:38:09.779]  I mean, you want to talk about guys that, if they had the censorship today, we never would have heard of these guys.
[02:38:09.779 --> 02:38:10.800]  Well, here's what happens.
[02:38:10.800 --> 02:38:12.541]  A fish rots from the head and things go quick.
[02:38:13.945 --> 02:38:18.530]  I might have been blind ten years ago and he was already bad, but it's just now it's a race to the bottom.
[02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:26.618]  As soon as he went along with everybody else being deplatformed, as soon as he went along, I mean you go to YouTube, under CNN it's Joe Rogan.
[02:38:26.618 --> 02:38:28.740]  That's who they are.
[02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:34.746]  So he rolled over, presented his rear end to them, and our rear end at the same time, and so I was letting the guy know that
[02:38:36.699 --> 02:38:43.741]  Look, I'm pleasantly excited and surprised by suddenly all his videos are 80% negative.
[02:38:43.741 --> 02:38:46.101]  Everybody hates him now.
[02:38:46.101 --> 02:38:50.762]  My audience was pissed at me for not attacking him because I wasn't paying attention to him.
[02:38:50.762 --> 02:38:55.864]  And finally, my son, like six months ago, said, Joe the Snake Rogan, you really ought to listen to this, Dad.
[02:38:55.864 --> 02:38:56.424]  And I said, OK.
[02:38:56.424 --> 02:38:58.424]  And I started listening to what you're talking about.
[02:38:58.424 --> 02:39:00.105]  God bless you, Paul.
[02:39:00.105 --> 02:39:04.766]  And again, I don't care if somebody has a big, giant podcast on here.
[02:39:04.766 --> 02:39:05.906]  I hope Joe's successful.
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:13.145]  But I'm not going to let him do it at America or anybody else's expense.
[02:39:13.145 --> 02:39:17.508]  And that's exactly, he's beyond a snake.
[02:39:17.508 --> 02:39:18.769]  He's a lizard.
[02:39:18.769 --> 02:39:20.151]  He's a chameleon.
[02:39:20.151 --> 02:39:21.492]  He's a shapeshifter.
[02:39:21.492 --> 02:39:22.813]  I don't mean literally.
[02:39:22.813 --> 02:39:26.136]  But just everything he does is for this guest or that guest.
[02:39:26.136 --> 02:39:29.799]  But now, it's not even, oh, when a conservative's on, I'm a conservative.
[02:39:29.799 --> 02:39:31.020]  When a liberal's on, I'm a liberal.
[02:39:32.341 --> 02:39:35.923]  No, now it's just pure corporate crap.
[02:39:35.923 --> 02:39:39.544]  So I went and looked up last night a list of his sponsors that he doesn't put on the site, but you can find.
[02:39:39.544 --> 02:39:48.068]  And I watched the podcast and I was like, my God, everything he says is a scripted ad.
[02:39:48.068 --> 02:39:48.608]  Worked in.
[02:39:49.944 --> 02:39:52.346]  Oh, I love this product I heard of, Jack.
[02:39:52.346 --> 02:39:53.387]  Tell me.
[02:39:53.387 --> 02:39:54.888]  Oh yeah, it's real good.
[02:39:54.888 --> 02:39:59.212]  They don't even tell you he's the owner of it, and the whole show's about it.
[02:39:59.212 --> 02:40:10.861]  We're going to break it back with Dan Lyman, and I'll take a little bit of time for Salente to go to Frank and Jeff and James and Andrew and Anthony and a few others that are holding.
[02:40:10.861 --> 02:40:13.122]  Speaking of sponsorship, you heard some of the other callers.
[02:40:13.982 --> 02:40:16.924]  When callers call in and plug stuff, we sell a lot of product.
[02:40:16.924 --> 02:40:21.827]  We have third-party review site, like Power Reviews.
[02:40:21.827 --> 02:40:28.632]  And they even had BuzzFeed try to harass them and say, oh, the reviews are fake, as if I've got time or energy or know how the hell to do that.
[02:40:28.632 --> 02:40:32.115]  No, we really have 98% reviews.
[02:40:32.115 --> 02:40:39.300]  We really have products that are incredible, because I go to top facilities and I say, I want the best fish oil you got.
[02:40:40.134 --> 02:40:41.996]  What's the top company in the U.S.?
[02:40:41.996 --> 02:40:44.438]  Because the companies never own their manufacturing facilities.
[02:40:44.438 --> 02:40:46.179]  They always contract out.
[02:40:46.179 --> 02:40:52.044]  And they go, okay, this top company's putting $3 in each bottle.
[02:40:52.044 --> 02:40:54.086]  And I go, excuse me?
[02:40:54.086 --> 02:40:54.867]  Why?
[02:40:54.867 --> 02:41:00.932]  Well, they don't take all the mercury out and they leave in some of the other microscopic pieces of the fish and the krill.
[02:41:03.055 --> 02:41:07.657]  And yeah, the strongest stuff is $5 a bottle, and then markup and everything.
[02:41:07.657 --> 02:41:13.759]  And I'm like, okay, well, let's put $10 in the bottle.
[02:41:13.759 --> 02:41:15.599]  Can you do that?
[02:41:15.599 --> 02:41:18.681]  And they said, yeah, we can actually do that.
[02:41:18.681 --> 02:41:24.102]  Then I have it tested by another firm, because I want you to get the insane level.
[02:41:24.102 --> 02:41:24.903]  See, I want that karma.
[02:41:25.816 --> 02:41:28.218]  I don't believe in the whole Hindu karma thing, but you know what I mean.
[02:41:28.218 --> 02:41:29.799]  Reap what you sow.
[02:41:29.799 --> 02:41:30.319]  It's the best.
[02:41:30.319 --> 02:41:31.800]  It's what my children take.
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:32.381]  It's what I take.
[02:41:32.381 --> 02:41:35.063]  Let me tell you something.
[02:41:35.063 --> 02:41:38.225]  Take Brain Force Plus, but be careful.
[02:41:38.225 --> 02:41:40.947]  Because you don't want to take it 10 hours before you're supposed to go to sleep.
[02:41:40.947 --> 02:41:43.068]  Take the nootropia that goes with it, Brain Force.
[02:41:43.068 --> 02:41:44.970]  See how clean and great it is.
[02:41:44.970 --> 02:41:46.771]  See Ultimate Bone Broth, new sale.

[02:42:00.901 --> 02:42:10.046]  Well, that's not a good seller for it, but yeah, Vice did a whole hit piece going, ugh, I mixed it with water, and he barely mixes it, like he's, he really feels sorry for him.
[02:42:10.046 --> 02:42:12.587]  I mean, it might be fun at the Special Olympics.

[02:44:08.814 --> 02:44:09.334]  We stopped her.
[02:44:09.334 --> 02:44:10.835]  We got a nationalist in.

[02:47:34.148 --> 02:47:46.476]  All right, Dan Lyman, I love to pop in at least once a week from EuropeWars.com, subsidiary of the operations here, and there is so much insanity reviewing the last few days of news.
[02:47:46.476 --> 02:47:56.483]  The yellow vest, police caught targeting them, the video, Muslim patrols, mass rapes, women having to wear hijabs not to be raped in Germany.
[02:47:56.483 --> 02:48:01.606]  Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com, thank you for joining us to give us the latest update.
[02:48:01.606 --> 02:48:02.527]  Great to be back with you, Alex.
[02:48:03.211 --> 02:48:04.992]  Well, start rolling, my compadre.
[02:48:04.992 --> 02:48:06.633]  There's a lot here.
[02:48:06.633 --> 02:48:07.813]  Gosh, there is such a lot.
[02:48:07.813 --> 02:48:09.914]  And, you know, there's so much going on in the U.S., too.
[02:48:09.914 --> 02:48:13.576]  Today is one of those days where you really feel the quickening.
[02:48:13.576 --> 02:48:22.320]  And just covering the waterfront today, just what's going on in Europe and how it ties into what's going on in the United States is just incredible.
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:24.101]  But, I mean, there's so much.
[02:48:24.101 --> 02:48:28.523]  But as you mentioned, we have the Islamic patrols here in New York City that are just kicking off.
[02:48:29.043 --> 02:48:37.988]  And then you have in the UK, in Birmingham, we have a Muslim school where girls are not allowed to eat until the boys have eaten.
[02:48:37.988 --> 02:48:43.832]  And they have already been found to be in violation of segregation rules in the UK in 2017.
[02:48:43.832 --> 02:48:45.373]  They're still in operation.
[02:48:45.373 --> 02:48:50.636]  I just kind of want to fly through a couple things here, just cover the waterfront, because it's just so much to look at.
[02:48:51.396 --> 02:48:56.498]  A great reporter out of Sweden, Peter Sweden, he just does a great job of tracking what's going on there.
[02:48:56.498 --> 02:49:06.902]  He just put together the crime statistics that have been all compiled from 2017 and 2018 and just itemized them for Sweden.
[02:49:06.902 --> 02:49:11.243]  7,840 rapes in Sweden last year with half of them being children.
[02:49:11.243 --> 02:49:16.745]  And that's important because this goes to also what's going on with the abortion situation in the United States.
[02:49:17.305 --> 02:49:33.770]  So often it comes down to the children, and the children are either left, you know, on their own, undefended in many ways, whether it is abortion, or it's these situations with the migrants, or they are actively put into these situations by people who should be taking care of them.
[02:49:33.770 --> 02:49:36.510]  And you just flashed the InfoWars Europe screen.
[02:49:36.510 --> 02:49:42.092]  I just did a story over the weekend about migrants being banned from visiting schools and daycares in a small
[02:49:42.712 --> 02:49:42.892]  Yeah.
[02:49:58.580 --> 02:50:09.064]  All involving girls under the age of 15, some as young as 10, and all of them involving migrant men who either gang-raped them or raped them over a period of months.
[02:50:09.064 --> 02:50:17.707]  And it's just crazy, and I was wondering, why would migrant men be visiting daycares and schools in this little city in Finland?
[02:50:17.707 --> 02:50:21.688]  And it turns out there is an EU-funded project called the Essikoto Project,
[02:50:22.228 --> 02:50:30.654]  Which invites asylum seekers, quote-unquote, to visit schools where the children go as part of the integration program.
[02:50:30.654 --> 02:50:42.243]  Sure, that's just like in Germany and Sweden and in England, they make kids twice a year not go to a Christian church, not a Catholic church, no, or an Orthodox church or a Protestant church, they make you go to a mosque.
[02:50:43.934 --> 02:50:47.378]  Yes, and they're also bringing the mosque to them effectively.
[02:50:47.378 --> 02:51:02.718]  And this reminded me at the end of last year, December, just a couple months ago, there was a huge scandal that kind of quietly broke in Poland, where there were migrant men who were being brought to a Polish camp called Euro Week Camp.
[02:51:03.178 --> 02:51:03.639]  We're good to go.
[02:51:19.662 --> 02:51:33.431]  They were all these pictures of the migrant men at the camp, you know, grown men, maybe 20, 30 years old, and they're all over these very, very young 12, 13-year-old Polish girls, kissing them, hugging them, and so that was a little, a scandal that broke out.
[02:51:33.431 --> 02:51:40.075]  Well, we have all the famous footage of women being mass raped at these, quote, anti-racism events in Sweden and Germany.
[02:51:40.075 --> 02:51:43.597]  I mean, we're talking like 50 men on YouTube gang raping women.
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:48.743]  Yes, and they don't care how old the women are.
[02:51:48.743 --> 02:51:52.205]  They'll go for 10-year-old girls or 85-year-old women.
[02:51:52.205 --> 02:51:54.567]  There is no discretion used by these people.
[02:51:54.567 --> 02:51:58.269]  It's all-out warfare on women.
[02:51:58.269 --> 02:52:01.852]  And I'm not saying that they all do that, of course, but there's just way too much going on.
[02:52:01.852 --> 02:52:03.032]  The West doesn't do this.
[02:52:03.032 --> 02:52:05.954]  We're the ones that stopped it, and I'm sick of being blamed with it.
[02:52:05.954 --> 02:52:09.497]  Every time I see these videos of women being drugged and gang-raped, I get really angry.
[02:52:09.497 --> 02:52:10.758]  What the hell's going on, Dan?
[02:52:11.812 --> 02:52:14.733]  These make me really angry as well, and I think you can tie this in.
[02:52:14.733 --> 02:52:16.954]  It's always leftists that are for this.
[02:52:16.954 --> 02:52:20.195]  Leftists are fine with killing a baby right after it's come out of the womb.
[02:52:20.195 --> 02:52:27.578]  They're also fine with sticking your 10-year-old daughter with a few migrant men from who knows where, with who knows what values.
[02:52:27.578 --> 02:52:31.319]  I wouldn't be okay with my 10-year-old girl with 10 guys from Sweden.
[02:52:31.319 --> 02:52:35.681]  I mean, the bottom line is, this is just bizarre, like, sacrificing of children.
[02:52:36.141 --> 02:52:37.082]  What is the end game of this?
[02:52:58.098 --> 02:53:01.761]  Because some feminists say it's okay to be raped by a Muslim.
[02:53:01.761 --> 02:53:03.603]  It's like a weird, weird cucking.
[02:53:03.603 --> 02:53:05.764]  But I mean, what's the endgame to this?
[02:53:05.764 --> 02:53:07.666]  Because it's all over Europe.
[02:53:07.666 --> 02:53:09.847]  Women are having to wear hijabs now to go out.
[02:53:09.847 --> 02:53:13.510]  Liberal, the mayor of Cologne says don't wear a miniskirt.
[02:53:13.510 --> 02:53:14.351]  It's your fault.
[02:53:14.351 --> 02:53:18.875]  I mean, it's like if a Western man looks at a woman, it's rape in a Gillette commercial.
[02:53:18.875 --> 02:53:21.797]  But if Muslim men rape a woman, it's like a sacrament.
[02:53:23.488 --> 02:53:33.211]  Right, and you know, I think that's what's happened here, where we've let the ideology of modern feminism has demasculated men across the West.
[02:53:33.211 --> 02:53:33.971]  And is that it?
[02:53:33.971 --> 02:53:37.453]  Like, modern feminism is just anti-Western, anti-Christian.
[02:53:37.453 --> 02:53:39.113]  It actually likes women being gang-raped.
[02:53:39.113 --> 02:53:43.634]  I mean, they have feminists on TV saying, wear the hijab, you know, it's the new thing.
[02:53:43.634 --> 02:53:48.176]  15-year-olds marry 30-year-olds, you know, push women down the stairs, break their necks, it's so trendy.
[02:53:49.759 --> 02:53:52.081]  Yeah, I mean this video, this one makes me one of the maddest.
[02:53:52.081 --> 02:53:53.842]  This one's crazy.
[02:53:53.842 --> 02:54:07.230]  No, I think that men have abdicated the role at this point across the West, and now we are seeing what happens because a lot of the men in these other cultures, they don't care about feminism, they couldn't care less about it.
[02:54:07.230 --> 02:54:11.873]  They see women as dogs, and so they use that the West puts women on a pedestal.
[02:54:11.873 --> 02:54:14.435]  The West is all about goddess worship, people who don't know the ethos of the West.
[02:54:14.955 --> 02:54:27.727]  We put women on a pedestal, and then now comes a group that treats them literally like toilet paper, and the women, instead of, like, wanting a man that's nice to them, they get the reverse cuck, and a lot of them actually like getting their jaw broken by an Islamicist.
[02:54:29.036 --> 02:54:39.522]  Yeah, and you know, I think, you know, some people will say, you know, especially from the U.S., they'll say, oh, well, this is what they voted for, let them have it, or this is where Europe's headed, you know, let them take it, people aren't standing up.
[02:54:39.522 --> 02:54:53.050]  No, it's a very small faction of people that are very aggressive and they're driving this agenda across the West, and especially in Europe, and there are a lot of guys who have just stepped aside who are soy boys eating way too much soy.
[02:54:53.050 --> 02:54:53.610]  Well, what do you do?
[02:54:53.610 --> 02:54:54.631]  We just got footage in Berlin.
[02:54:55.211 --> 02:54:57.733]  We're not going to show the shirts off.
[02:54:57.733 --> 02:55:00.474]  The women pull their shirts off and go, Allah Akbar!
[02:55:00.474 --> 02:55:01.655]  We want Islam!
[02:55:01.655 --> 02:55:04.856]  And the Muslims are like, ha ha, yes, bitch, you both know about me.
[02:55:04.856 --> 02:55:05.737]  Ah, yes.
[02:55:05.737 --> 02:55:07.238]  I mean, let's turn up the audio.
[02:55:07.238 --> 02:55:10.900]  These are feminists praising genital mutilation, women in slave pits.
[02:55:12.310 --> 02:55:13.271]  These aren't even women.
[02:55:13.271 --> 02:55:14.753]  I mean, these are barely human beings.
[02:55:14.753 --> 02:55:15.233]  Look at these.
[02:55:15.233 --> 02:55:17.255]  They're zombies from a different planet.
[02:55:17.255 --> 02:55:17.956]  Well, let's say it.
[02:55:17.956 --> 02:55:28.226]  These type of super-feminist lesbians, I don't hate women that like women, but this type are like wannabe men and want women as prisoners.
[02:55:28.226 --> 02:55:32.010]  So they, statistically, are the most abusive other than Muslim men.
[02:55:32.010 --> 02:55:34.513]  They like Muslim men because they want kept women.
[02:55:36.332 --> 02:55:36.992]  Definitely.
[02:55:36.992 --> 02:55:40.794]  And you know, and going back to just that not what can we do?
[02:55:40.794 --> 02:55:46.436]  Well, there is a problem with what we can do because now we can't even speak out against it.
[02:55:46.436 --> 02:56:03.383]  And I just saw this new release, a press release from the European Commission just came out today reminding us all that they are the IT companies which they categorize as the big four as Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are doing such a great job of flagging content
[02:56:04.104 --> 02:56:08.169]  Within 24 hours, 89% of flagged content is reviewed, and blah blah blah.
[02:56:08.169 --> 02:56:22.047]  And then it reminds us that combating racism and xenophobia is the name of the program, criminalizes the public incitement to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons or a member of such group defined by reference to race, color, religion, descent, blah blah blah.
[02:56:22.447 --> 02:56:35.059]  And then it says, to respond to the proliferation of racist and xenophobic hate speech online, the European Commission and four major IT companies, the ones I listed, presented the Code of Conduct back in 2016, and they are rolling that out.
[02:56:35.059 --> 02:56:42.325]  And that is happening now, and we saw that just the other day with a guy who, he happened to just retweet a limerick that was making fun of transgender women.
[02:56:42.325 --> 02:56:43.807]  He got a knock at the door from the police.
[02:56:44.267 --> 02:56:56.494]  So if people don't understand what's going on in Europe, you better wake up fast because the police will knock at your door if you say anything bad about the invasion of your countries by men who are content with raping ten-year-old girls.
[02:56:56.494 --> 02:56:59.416]  And let's be clear, the leftists, the big banks, have made the decision.
[02:56:59.716 --> 02:57:09.823]  Neutralize the men in the West, open up to Islam, overrun us, let them cut genitals off, put women in slave camps, murder whoever they want, because they're the muscle coming in.
[02:57:09.823 --> 02:57:14.666]  We're just told to stand down, or we can't sit there and tweet to our friends, and this is a takeover, Dan.
[02:57:14.666 --> 02:57:19.749]  It sure is, and yeah, we're watching it unfold in high speed now.
[02:57:20.606 --> 02:57:25.708]  Let me ask you when we come back, I'm going to do a statement of cause, let Gerald Cilente take over, he's loaded for bear.
[02:57:25.708 --> 02:57:29.909]  What's coming next and how bad do you think it's going to get before it hits rock bottom?
[02:57:29.909 --> 02:57:36.672]  And how long can the average leftist stay cucked in this weird religion of self-destruction?
[02:57:36.672 --> 02:57:39.072]  Or they should just move to the Middle East, I think it's so great.
[02:57:39.072 --> 02:57:40.473]  We'll be back, hour number four.
[02:57:40.473 --> 02:57:42.434]  Help spread those live links, you're our only hope.
[02:57:54.557 --> 02:58:03.560]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:13.644]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:58:13.644 --> 02:58:22.187]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:23.007 --> 02:58:24.348]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:58:24.348 --> 02:58:25.509]  You must experience it.
[02:58:25.509 --> 02:58:32.514]  It is a total game-changer when it comes to easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:58:32.514 --> 02:58:34.036]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:58:34.036 --> 02:58:35.517]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:58:35.517 --> 02:58:42.202]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:58:42.202 --> 02:58:46.645]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[02:58:46.645 --> 02:58:49.747]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they canned food.
[02:58:49.747 --> 02:58:51.289]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:58:52.641 --> 02:58:55.607]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:58:55.607 --> 02:59:00.175]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply on the top.
[02:59:01.232 --> 02:59:02.593]  Most respected companies out there.
[02:59:02.593 --> 02:59:10.356]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[02:59:21.502 --> 02:59:22.982]  They've got special diet foods.
[02:59:22.982 --> 02:59:26.984]  They've got three-month supplies, year's supplies, and week emergency supplies.
[02:59:26.984 --> 02:59:29.185]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:59:29.185 --> 02:59:30.266]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:59:30.726 --> 02:59:32.728]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:59:32.728 --> 02:59:35.249]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:59:35.249 --> 02:59:40.253]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:59:40.253 --> 02:59:49.219]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:59:49.219 --> 02:59:51.841]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:58.143 --> 03:00:00.804]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:00.804 --> 03:00:06.425]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:00:06.425 --> 03:00:11.747]  By the way, folks, let's be clear.
[03:00:11.747 --> 03:00:14.888]  Statistics in the main don't lie.
[03:00:14.888 --> 03:00:16.628]  I was against all these Gulf Wars.
[03:00:16.628 --> 03:00:18.529]  I didn't want to destabilize the Middle East.
[03:00:18.529 --> 03:00:21.830]  I was against the Arab Spring because we were putting bad people in.
[03:00:24.088 --> 03:00:32.913]  But you can't go to any of the 40-something or 50-something Muslim countries and be a Christian or teach the gospel.
[03:00:32.913 --> 03:00:38.956]  Or if you're two gay guys sit there, you know, do your kissy kiss on the street, you get killed.
[03:00:38.956 --> 03:00:42.138]  And then it's all America that's bad.
[03:00:42.138 --> 03:00:43.258]  It's Europe that's bad.
[03:00:43.258 --> 03:00:49.862]  And then we bring in military-age men, five years in on average, 80-plus percent are still on welfare, not working.
[03:00:51.445 --> 03:01:04.750]  We got a bunch of people wearing Halloween outfits, you know, full-body nightgowns, strutting around bitching with their oiled beards, gibbering at everyone, and their women are all locked up as prisoners.
[03:01:04.750 --> 03:01:05.791]  I mean, I'm done!
[03:01:05.791 --> 03:01:07.251]  I'm done!
[03:01:07.251 --> 03:01:10.532]  I can't go to their country!
[03:01:10.532 --> 03:01:11.673]  No!
[03:01:11.673 --> 03:01:16.875]  They gotta come here and I gotta roll over so they can have their way with me, Dan Lyman.
[03:01:16.875 --> 03:01:19.356]  So what's coming next, Dan, of EuropeWars.com?
[03:01:22.335 --> 03:01:25.697]  I fear what's coming next is something that nobody wants.
[03:01:25.697 --> 03:01:44.891]  Stefan Molyneux just delivered an excellent speech at European Parliament last week and it just became made available today and it was about big tech censorship and he made the great point that previously people were allowed to discuss and debate things and talk about where they wanted society to go and
[03:01:46.619 --> 03:02:01.675]  Increasingly, conservatives and just anti-leftists, anti-globalists are being silenced and they're not allowed to carry on a dialogue, a civilized debate about what's going on in our countries and, you know, each policy and what's being implemented.
[03:02:01.675 --> 03:02:03.237]  And when you suppress the
[03:02:03.957 --> 03:02:15.330]  That that medium of people being able to kind of let off the steam valve and and you know and have a say in what's going on and keep the push and pull from left and right you know in balance.
[03:02:15.330 --> 03:02:24.120]  If you take that away and you just drive this crazy leftist feminist globalist agenda without anyone even being allowed to say anything about it in the negative.
[03:02:24.680 --> 03:02:28.525]  Then the pendulum is going to swing back in the opposite direction and it's not going to be pretty.
[03:02:28.525 --> 03:02:34.132]  And that's what I fear at this point with the way that things are going in France is just the beginning.
[03:02:34.132 --> 03:02:38.357]  It's just the beginning and it's going to get crazier in other countries.
[03:02:38.357 --> 03:02:43.944]  Every time there is a controversial killing by migrants in Germany the protests get a little bit bigger.
[03:02:44.504 --> 03:02:48.148]  And soon, you know, you get a few more of those and they're going to be out of control.
[03:02:48.148 --> 03:02:52.733]  And France is going to feed off that and things in the UK, I mean, they're going to feed off that as well.
[03:02:52.733 --> 03:02:56.618]  Sweden, I mean, they have to be up to their eyeballs in it right now at this point.
[03:02:56.618 --> 03:03:04.066]  So you just you oppress people long enough and you're not going to like when the boiler just explodes.
[03:03:05.117 --> 03:03:06.177]  Well, you're exactly right.
[03:03:06.177 --> 03:03:09.338]  And then the French police have been caught saying, shoot him in the face.
[03:03:09.338 --> 03:03:11.719]  That's only making the protests get bigger.
[03:03:11.719 --> 03:03:14.880]  Don't they get that people were asleep before?
[03:03:14.880 --> 03:03:16.281]  They're awake now.
[03:03:16.281 --> 03:03:17.921]  They always thought, oh, we were intimidated.
[03:03:17.921 --> 03:03:18.822]  It's why we didn't fight back.
[03:03:18.822 --> 03:03:20.562]  No, we were asleep.
[03:03:20.562 --> 03:03:22.763]  Don't they get that attacking us only awakens us?
[03:03:24.056 --> 03:03:40.861]  They've woken the sleeping giant and with each thing that right there you have Mr. Rodriguez who now has suffered a life-changing injury and all he was doing was just filming live streaming on Facebook and they shot him with one of these flashballs apparently and so that that has been another rallying cry for the yellow vests
[03:03:41.301 --> 03:03:45.324]  So, every time they do something like this, they ratchet up the response.
[03:03:45.324 --> 03:03:50.308]  And they're not going to like it if they keep pushing the French, you know, further and further over the edge.
[03:03:50.308 --> 03:03:52.049]  And it doesn't look like they're going to stop.
[03:03:52.049 --> 03:03:53.771]  I mean, they're going to keep pushing them.
[03:03:53.771 --> 03:03:56.913]  Well, if it goes much further, I think the guillotines are going to roll out.
[03:03:58.021 --> 03:03:58.981]  It wouldn't surprise me.
[03:03:58.981 --> 03:03:59.901]  Nothing would surprise me.
[03:03:59.901 --> 03:04:01.682]  The historical precedent is there.
[03:04:01.682 --> 03:04:06.623]  So, we just all need to be, you know, as reserved as possible in handling all this.
[03:04:06.623 --> 03:04:08.603]  But, the revolution's on.
[03:04:08.603 --> 03:04:10.203]  The populist revolution is on.
[03:04:10.203 --> 03:04:12.984]  And I don't see it slowing down.
[03:04:12.984 --> 03:04:14.044]  I agree with you.
[03:04:14.044 --> 03:04:19.145]  And, you know, you've got all these insulated elitists like Jack Dorsey and Joe Rogan and Macron.
[03:04:19.145 --> 03:04:21.265]  And they don't seem to get what's happened here.
[03:04:21.265 --> 03:04:24.666]  This is a... Nobody's put the duty back in the bottle.
[03:04:26.756 --> 03:04:28.436]  A lot of them seem like they're on drugs.
[03:04:28.436 --> 03:04:31.317]  That's what I boil it down to.
[03:04:31.317 --> 03:04:31.657]  That's right.
[03:04:31.657 --> 03:04:32.357]  Well, you're not.
[03:04:32.357 --> 03:04:33.418]  You're on truth.
[03:04:33.418 --> 03:04:35.738]  Dan Lyman is awesome.
[03:04:35.738 --> 03:04:38.259]  See his incredible work at EuropeWars.com.
[03:04:38.259 --> 03:04:40.079]  Only you can override the censors.
[03:04:40.079 --> 03:04:45.441]  Only you can break the will of the globalists at EuropeWars.com.
[03:04:45.441 --> 03:04:46.561]  Thanks, Dan Lyman.
[03:04:46.561 --> 03:04:47.901]  Coming up, a few more phone calls.
[03:04:47.901 --> 03:04:51.082]  Then, Gerald Solente, the top trends forecaster, is ready.
[03:04:57.048 --> 03:05:00.070]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:05:00.070 --> 03:05:06.515]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:05:06.515 --> 03:05:21.986]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[03:05:35.590 --> 03:05:41.993]  Perfect for work, in the car, or at home, TurboForce is the ultimate answer to a sluggish day.
[03:05:41.993 --> 03:05:43.994]  Don't let your day slow you down.
[03:05:43.994 --> 03:05:46.836]  Perk up with TurboForce at infowarrestore.com.
[03:06:15.615 --> 03:06:19.197]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[03:06:19.197 --> 03:06:30.023]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:30.023 --> 03:06:35.727]  Suspicious is your name.
[03:06:35.727 --> 03:06:37.308]  Your honesty to blame.
[03:06:37.308 --> 03:06:39.589]  With dignity you say it's not her.
[03:06:44.119 --> 03:06:52.225]  TrendsResearch.com, Zero Salente, best-selling author, one of the top analysts in the world about the economy and where things are going and the global revolution.
[03:06:52.225 --> 03:06:54.567]  He predicted over a decade ago he's coming up next segment.
[03:06:54.567 --> 03:06:59.291]  But I promise to get to all your calls, even though we limited the amount of calls that come in to about 12 at a time.
[03:06:59.291 --> 03:07:02.873]  So I'm going to get to Frank, James, and Jeff, and that's it.
[03:07:02.873 --> 03:07:04.575]  So thank you for holding.
[03:07:04.575 --> 03:07:08.478]  Let's go ahead and go to Frank, James, and then Jeff.
[03:07:08.478 --> 03:07:10.019]  Frank, thanks for holding from North Carolina.
[03:07:10.019 --> 03:07:10.319]  Go ahead.
[03:07:13.103 --> 03:07:19.685]  You know, I caught in about something else, but I agree with everything your guest just said.
[03:07:19.685 --> 03:07:35.549]  However, going even further and being more politically incorrect, I just have to say, statistics for a long time have shown pretty steadily that over 30,000 white women a year are raped in the United States.
[03:07:35.549 --> 03:07:37.610]  And, you know, statistics are a funny thing.
[03:07:38.246 --> 03:07:43.052]  Less than one black woman a year is raped by a white man in the United States of America.
[03:07:43.052 --> 03:07:46.657]  How come we don't have athletes getting down on one knee?
[03:07:47.310 --> 03:07:52.714]  And protesting and bringing attention to this epidemic that's going on in America.
[03:08:17.690 --> 03:08:18.930]  So, I appreciate you calling.
[03:08:18.930 --> 03:08:21.051]  This is Frank, isn't it?
[03:08:21.051 --> 03:08:24.472]  Yeah, it's been over 13 months, actually.
[03:08:24.472 --> 03:08:34.734]  But, you know, I really think you need to give some time for a response because, you know, this movie, I guess, aimed to hurt Trump, probably, in some weird way.
[03:08:34.734 --> 03:08:37.875]  But, you know, it's supposed to be about David Duke, the black Klansman.
[03:08:38.679 --> 03:08:42.543]  I think you really ought to have him on to respond to this, because he can basically break it down.
[03:08:42.543 --> 03:08:45.105]  The whole movie is nothing but a bunch of lies.
[03:08:45.105 --> 03:08:47.007]  It's totally fictitious.
[03:08:48.159 --> 03:08:49.660]  Well, I'll say this.
[03:08:49.660 --> 03:08:57.482]  I don't agree with David Duke's policies, but he's not half as racist as somebody like Alexandra Cortez or Barack Obama.
[03:08:57.482 --> 03:09:01.223]  So, my whole thing is, this is all a bunch of racism.
[03:09:01.223 --> 03:09:04.203]  The whole country's descending into race this, race that.
[03:09:04.203 --> 03:09:11.165]  I turn the TV on, Mary Poppins is racist, being white is evil, and it's meant to make white people racist.
[03:09:11.165 --> 03:09:13.226]  Look, look, it's just like a prison.
[03:09:13.226 --> 03:09:13.806]  You got the black
[03:09:14.826 --> 03:09:17.068]  You got the Hispanic area and the white area.
[03:09:17.068 --> 03:09:19.310]  And if it's on the east or west coast, the Asian area.
[03:09:19.310 --> 03:09:20.390]  So three to four groups.
[03:09:20.390 --> 03:09:21.531]  They're all divided.
[03:09:21.531 --> 03:09:23.393]  The warren controls everybody.
[03:09:23.393 --> 03:09:25.414]  The warden does.
[03:09:25.414 --> 03:09:32.279]  I'd rather not have us all fight with each other and be unified around the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and prosperity, Frank.
[03:09:32.279 --> 03:09:35.121]  But hey, Frank, I beg for your help.
[03:09:35.121 --> 03:09:37.102]  Frank, are you going to help me?
[03:09:37.102 --> 03:09:39.444]  Have you gone to InfoWarsTore.com?
[03:09:39.444 --> 03:09:40.625]  Have you been supporting us, Frank?
[03:09:40.625 --> 03:09:43.227]  Because I'm not perfect, Frank, but I need your help, Frank.
[03:09:44.508 --> 03:09:46.569]  We need to get David Duke on.
[03:09:46.569 --> 03:09:48.189]  Oh, David Duke!
[03:09:48.189 --> 03:09:50.890]  Like, if anybody's a reptilian, it's David Duke.
[03:09:50.890 --> 03:09:56.392]  You know, I interviewed Louis Faircon, who I disagree with a lot on, but he wanted to try to stop Race 4.
[03:09:56.392 --> 03:10:06.395]  And then when I had Duke on, all Duke did was sit there and try to make points the entire time I'm some Zionist shill, which is a load of crap.
[03:10:06.395 --> 03:10:10.536]  So, uh, the whole David Duke experience was worse than I thought it'd be.
[03:10:11.482 --> 03:10:14.304]  Duke agrees with Farrakhan on quite a bit.
[03:10:14.304 --> 03:10:15.625]  He talks about it all the time.
[03:10:15.625 --> 03:10:18.927]  He's always talking about Farrakhan on his show.
[03:10:18.927 --> 03:10:26.613]  He doesn't like when Farrakhan speaks hatefully against white people, but he actually agrees and has a lot of common ground with Farrakhan.
[03:10:26.613 --> 03:10:35.119]  And he has no problem with people, with black leaders looking out for the interests of black people.
[03:10:35.119 --> 03:10:36.721]  Obviously, whites are under attack.
[03:10:36.721 --> 03:10:37.941]  No one's debating that.
[03:10:37.941 --> 03:10:39.603]  All I'm saying to you is,
[03:10:41.263 --> 03:10:43.864]  The globalists are trying to abort all the babies.
[03:10:43.864 --> 03:10:46.245]  The globalists are putting fluoride in all the water.
[03:10:46.245 --> 03:10:57.951]  And I just, at a gut level, really want... I don't want to get into some leftist tit-for-tat and play their game, but I don't want to get into some David Duke stuff or Louis Faircon stuff.
[03:10:57.951 --> 03:10:59.692]  He's one of the most hated men in the world.
[03:10:59.692 --> 03:11:01.933]  He'd be a great guest.
[03:11:02.797 --> 03:11:06.358]  Oh, nobody's taking David Duke's bank accounts away.
[03:11:06.358 --> 03:11:07.398]  He's still on YouTube.
[03:11:07.398 --> 03:11:08.179]  I'm not.
[03:11:08.179 --> 03:11:09.639]  Why have I been taken off everywhere?
[03:11:09.639 --> 03:11:13.640]  He's had a lot of problems, Alex.
[03:11:13.640 --> 03:11:14.300]  I don't know.
[03:11:14.300 --> 03:11:17.681]  And I'm not saying take David Duke or Louis Farrakhan off.
[03:11:17.681 --> 03:11:19.922]  And I'm not endorsing them either.
[03:11:19.922 --> 03:11:22.903]  They do not have half the problems I have.
[03:11:22.903 --> 03:11:23.823]  Believe me.
[03:11:23.823 --> 03:11:25.603]  Oh, they're staging attacks.
[03:11:25.603 --> 03:11:26.784]  Oh yeah, let me tell you.
[03:11:26.784 --> 03:11:27.544]  They're real staged.
[03:11:28.835 --> 03:11:30.495]  I wouldn't want to feel real attacks then.
[03:11:30.495 --> 03:11:32.776]  They've been kicking a living snot out of me here.
[03:11:32.776 --> 03:11:35.356]  So, I appreciate your call, man.
[03:11:35.356 --> 03:11:38.137]  You know, here's my deal.
[03:11:38.137 --> 03:11:42.477]  I just can't look at little kids, Hispanic kids, black kids, white kids, and just think of them as different.
[03:11:42.477 --> 03:11:44.558]  I just can't do it.
[03:11:44.558 --> 03:11:46.378]  I just can't do it.
[03:11:46.378 --> 03:11:49.439]  And it doesn't matter if there's a bunch of white racists, a bunch of black racists.
[03:11:49.439 --> 03:11:51.459]  I mean, hell, I know they act like only whites are racist.
[03:11:51.459 --> 03:11:52.459]  Give me a break.
[03:11:52.459 --> 03:11:53.839]  I grew up in Dallas, Texas, man.
[03:11:53.839 --> 03:11:56.360]  Some of those racist people in the world are black people.
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:57.860]  But some of them are really nice, good people too.
[03:11:59.171 --> 03:12:02.314]  And so I just, I don't get down on that level.
[03:12:02.314 --> 03:12:04.516]  It doesn't mean that stuff's not going on.
[03:12:04.516 --> 03:12:07.698]  And I'm not buying into white guilt either.
[03:12:07.698 --> 03:12:09.680]  God almighty.
[03:12:09.680 --> 03:12:10.580]  I got a bunch of calls.
[03:12:10.580 --> 03:12:16.725]  I don't know what to do anymore.
[03:12:16.725 --> 03:12:17.906]  I just don't know what to do.
[03:12:17.906 --> 03:12:20.268]  We're just going to kill each other.
[03:12:20.268 --> 03:12:23.111]  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[03:12:23.111 --> 03:12:24.352]  Jeff and Canada, you're on the air.
[03:12:24.352 --> 03:12:24.712]  Go ahead.
[03:12:27.662 --> 03:12:32.824]  Hey Alex, I just want to say just straight out, I love who you are as a person.
[03:12:32.824 --> 03:12:37.766]  I love the spirit of God in you and how you deliver what you deliver on a daily basis.
[03:12:37.766 --> 03:12:38.606]  It's phenomenal.
[03:12:38.606 --> 03:12:39.746]  Well, thanks for putting up with my brother.
[03:12:39.746 --> 03:12:42.067]  I love you too.
[03:12:42.067 --> 03:12:47.329]  Hey, and I think you realize and you put that out there all the time.
[03:12:47.329 --> 03:12:49.090]  You know, there's two operating systems in the world.
[03:12:49.090 --> 03:12:52.211]  There's a spirit of Christ and there's a spirit of Antichrist.
[03:12:52.211 --> 03:12:52.571]  And you think,
[03:12:53.041 --> 03:12:59.223]  All these petty issues and, you know, satanic, you know, little cards in the deck.
[03:12:59.223 --> 03:13:03.404]  We can cover those all day, and I think you do a brilliant job of doing that.
[03:13:03.404 --> 03:13:09.205]  But I want to speak something out to you, and just, I'll let it sit with you.
[03:13:09.205 --> 03:13:16.487]  You shared a story one time of an ancestor that filled up a boatload of Bibles and took them to Texas.
[03:13:16.487 --> 03:13:21.208]  And it really brought the Word of God and the Gospel to Texas.
[03:13:22.057 --> 03:13:41.244]  And I really think there's a destiny on your life, from the seed of what happened there, to now put the gospel through the airwaves around the world, to every man, woman, and child of every color, and creed, and belief, and really talk about the love of God.
[03:13:41.244 --> 03:13:51.567]  Because I'll tell you, in an individual level, you can be satanically possessed and have a million things wrong with you, and Jesus is the only thing that breaks that yoke over people's lives.
[03:13:52.133 --> 03:13:59.220]  What we need to see is a awakening of people linked together in the spirit of Jesus.
[03:13:59.220 --> 03:14:01.342]  Not dead religion, but the spirit of Jesus.
[03:14:01.342 --> 03:14:02.443]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[03:14:02.443 --> 03:14:11.412]  And even if somebody's an atheist, should we be together in the golden rule, and I'm not an atheist, I believe in God, instead of just being controlled by Hollywood?
[03:14:11.412 --> 03:14:12.233]  I appreciate your call.
[03:14:12.233 --> 03:14:13.754]  James in Utah, last caller.
[03:14:13.754 --> 03:14:15.536]  Gerald Solendez taking over on the other side.
[03:14:15.536 --> 03:14:16.477]  Go ahead, James.
[03:14:18.021 --> 03:14:18.761]  Hi, Alex.
[03:14:18.761 --> 03:14:20.282]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:14:20.282 --> 03:14:21.543]  I really appreciate it.
[03:14:21.543 --> 03:14:23.323]  Appreciate you.
[03:14:23.323 --> 03:14:35.889]  Oh, I just I wanted to mention and thank you for opening my eyes because I have a little little daughter and to vaccines and you know, people did they act like I'm crazy, you know, or something like that.
[03:14:35.889 --> 03:14:38.170]  Like, oh, you know, they're fine.
[03:14:38.170 --> 03:14:39.350]  They're harmless.
[03:14:39.350 --> 03:14:40.391]  Nothing.
[03:14:40.391 --> 03:14:42.892]  Then I woke up things, you know, vaccine damage fine.
[03:14:43.684 --> 03:14:51.368]  Oh yeah, that's all an act by the medical staff to make you feel like a cook.
[03:14:51.368 --> 03:14:54.310]  And then you talk to the nurses later and they go, oh none of us take them either.
[03:14:54.310 --> 03:14:55.551]  Exactly, it's all a hoax.
[03:15:03.777 --> 03:15:05.698]  Man, woman, child.
[03:15:05.698 --> 03:15:07.680]  They just want to destroy it.
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:08.180]  Exactly.
[03:15:08.180 --> 03:15:14.085]  The idea of the man and the woman being on a team and caring about each other and building a nest.
[03:15:14.085 --> 03:15:15.065]  That's independence.
[03:15:15.065 --> 03:15:16.827]  That's pure synergy.
[03:15:16.827 --> 03:15:17.727]  That's union.
[03:15:17.727 --> 03:15:20.289]  That's simplistic beauty.
[03:15:20.289 --> 03:15:23.091]  That is absolute completion.
[03:15:23.091 --> 03:15:24.792]  And that's what they don't want you to have.
[03:15:24.792 --> 03:15:25.873]  God bless you, James.
[03:15:25.873 --> 03:15:27.874]  All right, Gerald Cilente, the Trends Forecaster.
[03:15:28.735 --> 03:15:30.596]  He's on the other side of his break.
[03:15:30.596 --> 03:15:32.237]  There he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:32.237 --> 03:15:36.479]  And then, coming up in 45 minutes, The War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[03:15:36.479 --> 03:15:42.982]  Remember, it isn't patronization if you don't spread the articles.
[03:15:42.982 --> 03:15:45.663]  If you don't tell people about the links.
[03:15:45.663 --> 03:15:48.645]  If you don't push the ball forward, the enemy wins.
[03:15:48.645 --> 03:15:49.925]  You take action, we win.
[03:15:49.925 --> 03:15:50.526]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:50.526 --> 03:15:50.826]  Stay with us.
[03:15:53.285 --> 03:15:56.887]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:16:00.468 --> 03:16:02.589]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:18:03.533 --> 03:18:12.535]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:18:12.535 --> 03:18:22.618]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[03:18:43.004 --> 03:18:44.485]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:18:44.485 --> 03:18:51.167]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[03:19:57.228 --> 03:19:59.861]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.515 --> 03:20:27.079]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:27.079 --> 03:20:31.142]  And now, your host, Gerald Salente.
[03:20:33.793 --> 03:20:35.374]  Hello, hello, hello.
[03:20:35.374 --> 03:20:41.035]  Great being on InfoWars with Alex Jones and all the crew.
[03:20:41.035 --> 03:20:44.016]  And I thank them for all that they do.
[03:20:44.016 --> 03:20:50.237]  And yes, censorship, as the earlier guest was talking about, is real from right to left.
[03:20:50.237 --> 03:20:54.178]  Anybody that they want out, they take out.
[03:20:54.178 --> 03:20:56.159]  Freedom of speech is gone.
[03:20:56.159 --> 03:21:00.440]  And that's why it's very important that you support InfoWars in any way that you can.
[03:21:01.320 --> 03:21:06.282]  Because silence is going to be the minority rule.
[03:21:06.282 --> 03:21:10.604]  And the minority are a bunch of monopolies that are running the show.
[03:21:10.604 --> 03:21:16.327]  Back in the day, they would have never allowed these monopolies to be in place.
[03:21:16.327 --> 03:21:23.050]  We almost had a revolution back in the 30s, and the 20s, and earlier.
[03:21:23.050 --> 03:21:28.512]  All the laws put in place, the Robinson-Papman Act, Sherman Antitrust Act, Clayton Antitrust Act,
[03:21:29.474 --> 03:21:32.276]  To prevent the monopolies from taking over.
[03:21:32.276 --> 03:21:34.057]  And now the monopolies are in your face.
[03:21:34.057 --> 03:21:35.978]  It's not a game anymore.
[03:21:35.978 --> 03:21:37.279]  Amazon.
[03:21:37.279 --> 03:21:38.540]  Google.
[03:21:38.540 --> 03:21:39.840]  Facebook.
[03:21:39.840 --> 03:21:41.401]  Twitter.
[03:21:41.401 --> 03:21:43.683]  Look at all the large companies.
[03:21:43.683 --> 03:21:47.285]  The Home Depots.
[03:21:47.285 --> 03:21:48.926]  Staples.
[03:21:48.926 --> 03:21:53.749]  That put so many of we the people out of work.
[03:21:53.749 --> 03:21:55.250]  And let all the money go to the top.
[03:21:57.102 --> 03:22:02.104]  So when the guest was earlier talking about the Yellow Vest Movement in France, it's real.
[03:22:02.104 --> 03:22:14.169]  And one of the reasons why it's real, this is a fact, the richest 1% own 50% of stocks held by American households.
[03:22:14.169 --> 03:22:17.891]  1% own 50%.
[03:22:17.891 --> 03:22:23.793]  The monopolies have taken over the world, it's called
[03:22:26.929 --> 03:22:29.631]  Multinational firms.
[03:22:29.631 --> 03:22:31.932]  It's called globalization.
[03:22:31.932 --> 03:22:34.973]  And that's why they're fighting against nationalism.
[03:22:34.973 --> 03:22:39.916]  How dare we hold on to the American way?
[03:22:39.916 --> 03:22:41.057]  Or the Italian way?
[03:22:41.057 --> 03:22:41.997]  The Spanish way?
[03:22:41.997 --> 03:22:42.658]  The Greek way?
[03:22:42.658 --> 03:22:45.439]  The German way?
[03:22:45.439 --> 03:22:48.641]  How dare we hold on to our nationality?
[03:22:48.641 --> 03:22:52.343]  And our ethnicity?
[03:22:52.343 --> 03:22:55.585]  We have to become slaves in slavelandia.
[03:22:56.894 --> 03:23:03.737]  And work on the global, multinational plantations.
[03:23:03.737 --> 03:23:06.078]  So the Yellow Vest Movement.
[03:23:06.078 --> 03:23:09.780]  Look what's going on.
[03:23:09.780 --> 03:23:15.983]  I'm totally against, of course, I launched Occupy Peace, OccupyPeace.com.
[03:23:15.983 --> 03:23:20.025]  And I was down in D.C.
[03:23:20.025 --> 03:23:25.648]  this past August as a speaker at Ron Paul's Peace and Prosperity Conference.
[03:23:26.849 --> 03:23:31.692]  So I put my money in my heart and my soul where my mouth is.
[03:23:31.692 --> 03:23:39.055]  I'm totally against what's going on with the planned overthrow of the government of Venezuela.
[03:23:39.055 --> 03:23:42.117]  We have no business telling them what to do.
[03:23:42.117 --> 03:23:54.043]  And America's track record of bringing democracy and freedom to other countries is a complete recipe for disaster by the facts.
[03:23:55.529 --> 03:23:58.870]  Hey, wonderful going to Iraq, huh?
[03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:59.770]  How about Libya?
[03:23:59.770 --> 03:24:02.331]  Want to go there for a vacation, maybe?
[03:24:02.331 --> 03:24:05.432]  On the shores of Tripoli?
[03:24:05.432 --> 03:24:06.832]  What about Syria?
[03:24:06.832 --> 03:24:09.493]  I forgot about Yemen.
[03:24:09.493 --> 03:24:11.754]  Oh, Afghanistan.
[03:24:11.754 --> 03:24:16.755]  Haiti, beautiful job they've done there.
[03:24:16.755 --> 03:24:24.257]  One foreign entanglement after another that causes more hardship for the people and hatred against America.
[03:24:26.141 --> 03:24:28.622]  Would you hate a country that comes in?
[03:24:28.622 --> 03:24:32.023]  You know, we don't like this guy Trump.
[03:24:32.023 --> 03:24:35.084]  We don't like what he's doing to the people.
[03:24:35.084 --> 03:24:38.326]  You look at his low popularity ratings.
[03:24:38.326 --> 03:24:39.966]  You look at who he is.
[03:24:39.966 --> 03:24:49.470]  I say we should go over there and invade the United States and put in a new leader who we support.
[03:24:49.470 --> 03:24:55.372]  And that leader... No, no, not Juan Guaido from
[03:24:56.604 --> 03:24:58.106]  Venezuela?
[03:24:58.106 --> 03:24:59.588]  The guy who declared himself...
[03:25:01.488 --> 03:25:03.689]  I'm the president, you got it?
[03:25:03.689 --> 03:25:06.010]  I declared it, you got it?
[03:25:06.010 --> 03:25:08.990]  I'm a nobody, I'm a little flunky freak.
[03:25:08.990 --> 03:25:11.731]  Yeah, that they've been putting into the system for years.
[03:25:11.731 --> 03:25:15.112]  Oh, you didn't know I went to school over there in Washington, D.C.
[03:25:15.112 --> 03:25:20.894]  Oh, you didn't know I was coming up here getting prepped and meeting with the Trump administration and little Marco Rubio.
[03:25:20.894 --> 03:25:24.816]  Yeah, I'm declaring that I'm the president of Venezuela.
[03:25:24.816 --> 03:25:29.317]  Oh, I gotta say it in the proper accent, which I'm not really good at doing.
[03:25:31.676 --> 03:25:35.377]  So suppose little Bernie Sanders came out.
[03:25:35.377 --> 03:25:41.539]  I declare myself President of America.
[03:25:41.539 --> 03:25:44.339]  I don't like what Trump is doing.
[03:25:44.339 --> 03:25:48.820]  And I got a bunch of nations behind me that hate him.
[03:25:48.820 --> 03:25:55.422]  And I want you to all get out into the streets and take over the government and put me in.
[03:25:55.422 --> 03:25:57.483]  I'm the rightful guy.
[03:25:57.483 --> 03:25:58.423]  You'd laugh at it.
[03:25:59.912 --> 03:26:03.253]  That's how sick a joke it is.
[03:26:03.253 --> 03:26:05.674]  But it's not a sick joke.
[03:26:05.674 --> 03:26:11.056]  Because all these sanctions are nothing more than wars against the people.
[03:26:11.056 --> 03:26:12.816]  They're the ones that suffer.
[03:26:12.816 --> 03:26:15.457]  The elite don't suffer from sanctions.
[03:26:15.457 --> 03:26:17.218]  It's economic warfare.
[03:26:17.218 --> 03:26:22.680]  Just like bombing Dresden, you're bombing the people.
[03:26:22.680 --> 03:26:25.901]  Oh yeah, but we're gonna really make them angry and they're gonna overthrow the government.
[03:26:26.644 --> 03:26:28.886]  You guys are losers, failures.
[03:26:28.886 --> 03:26:35.690]  All you do is have a perfect track record of failure since World War II, and now you got another one?
[03:26:35.690 --> 03:26:39.632]  Hey, it couldn't be about this sitting on the world's second largest oil... No, excuse me.
[03:26:39.632 --> 03:26:43.815]  The largest oil reserves in the world in Venezuela.
[03:26:43.815 --> 03:26:45.336]  No, it's their broccoli crop.
[03:26:45.336 --> 03:26:52.761]  Same reason we invaded Iraq and Libya, I tells you.
[03:26:52.761 --> 03:26:54.682]  Where's the outrage?
[03:26:54.682 --> 03:26:55.963]  No one's talking against this.
[03:26:57.136 --> 03:26:59.678]  The media?
[03:26:59.678 --> 03:27:01.819]  100% behind it.
[03:27:01.819 --> 03:27:06.903]  All they keep bringing on are the flunkies, the prostitutes with misinformation.
[03:27:06.903 --> 03:27:09.825]  Ah, they had a fraudulent election!
[03:27:09.825 --> 03:27:10.666]  Oh yeah?
[03:27:10.666 --> 03:27:14.929]  Did you know that Venezuela asked the United Nations to go down there and monitor it?
[03:27:14.929 --> 03:27:17.791]  And the United States vetoed it?
[03:27:17.791 --> 03:27:23.915]  And several countries and international groups went down there and monitored the Maduro elections last May when he won?
[03:27:24.673 --> 03:27:32.975]  The elections in Venezuela in Maduro won, and they said it was straight ahead.
[03:27:32.975 --> 03:27:36.075]  No fraud that they could find.
[03:27:36.075 --> 03:27:38.156]  It's in your Trends Journal.
[03:27:38.156 --> 03:27:39.676]  The new edition just came out.
[03:27:39.676 --> 03:27:48.838]  There's an overview and facts and figures and data that are indisputable.
[03:27:48.838 --> 03:27:52.499]  If this war breaks out, which it looks like it's going to,
[03:27:53.194 --> 03:27:58.218]  You think you got a problem south of the border down Mexico way now?
[03:27:58.218 --> 03:28:00.859]  You haven't seen anything.
[03:28:00.859 --> 03:28:03.301]  The country in Venezuela is already in shambles.
[03:28:03.301 --> 03:28:06.804]  Three million people have left over the last few years.
[03:28:06.804 --> 03:28:09.085]  War breaks out in that region.
[03:28:09.085 --> 03:28:18.512]  They got enough weapons of mass destruction down there to blow the joint apart from Colombia to Brazil to Venezuela and throughout the area.
[03:28:19.179 --> 03:28:28.744]  We will have a refugee and migrant crisis, a human wave that you won't believe.
[03:28:28.744 --> 03:28:32.226]  You better stop it now before it hits us hard.
[03:28:32.226 --> 03:28:33.086]  I'll be back in a few.
[03:28:53.336 --> 03:28:56.918]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.918 --> 03:29:00.480]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.480 --> 03:29:02.621]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:34:52.379 --> 03:34:55.180]  That's all it is.
[03:34:55.180 --> 03:34:58.320]  Brainwash on top of brainwash.
[03:34:58.320 --> 03:35:09.063]  You know, I was talking before about the Venezuelan coup underway, and I get a kick out of all these liberals out there.
[03:35:10.071 --> 03:35:11.771]  Boy, do they love war.
[03:35:11.771 --> 03:35:16.852]  They forget that they're Obama, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner.
[03:35:16.852 --> 03:35:19.913]  The lovely job he did over there in Libya.
[03:35:19.913 --> 03:35:23.034]  Oh yeah, the richest country in Africa.
[03:35:23.034 --> 03:35:29.195]  People had more rights and better income and lifestyle living than anywhere else in the area.
[03:35:29.195 --> 03:35:38.937]  But, thanks to Obama, Hitler, Clinton, Samantha Power, Susan Rice, Sarkozy of France, and little boy Cameron over there in the UK,
[03:35:40.794 --> 03:35:45.296]  Gaddafi's gone, and now the place is totally destroyed, a hellhole.
[03:35:45.296 --> 03:35:54.559]  Built the foundation for ISIS as well, and brought them in then to take over the government of Syria.
[03:35:54.559 --> 03:35:56.660]  But those are only facts.
[03:35:56.660 --> 03:36:03.923]  So the facts are that those Democrats are as crazy as those Republicans when it comes to war.
[03:36:03.923 --> 03:36:05.784]  And, boy, do they support
[03:36:06.502 --> 03:36:11.664]  The coup, going on now, is being launched by the United States against Venezuela.
[03:36:11.664 --> 03:36:14.005]  That's right.
[03:36:14.005 --> 03:36:23.288]  That guy, Schiff, I think I'm spelling it right, I think Trump spells it more correctly than me, got a shit, a T in it.
[03:36:23.288 --> 03:36:31.430]  And, uh, yeah, that guy, that liberal over there from California, oh yeah, he's all in favor of the overthrow.
[03:36:31.430 --> 03:36:32.971]  And so there's a guy, uh,
[03:36:34.565 --> 03:36:35.746]  Dick Durbin.
[03:36:35.746 --> 03:36:37.868]  Oh, I gotta be proper.
[03:36:37.868 --> 03:36:39.269]  Maybe it's Penis Durbin.
[03:36:39.269 --> 03:36:43.312]  I don't want to be accused of calling him Dick Durbin.
[03:36:43.312 --> 03:36:44.573]  Oh, it is Dick Durbin.
[03:36:44.573 --> 03:36:46.614]  Okay, thank you.
[03:36:46.614 --> 03:36:48.016]  He's in favor of it too.
[03:36:48.016 --> 03:36:48.996]  One after another.
[03:36:48.996 --> 03:36:57.243]  All of these liberals running out there for El Presidente and Los Estados Unidos on the Democratic ticket.
[03:36:57.243 --> 03:36:58.404]  Beep.
[03:36:58.404 --> 03:36:59.625]  Beep.
[03:36:59.625 --> 03:37:02.747]  Silence.
[03:37:02.747 --> 03:37:03.868]  On what's going on there.
[03:37:04.585 --> 03:37:06.766]  And the United States rolling it.
[03:37:06.766 --> 03:37:10.247]  So, moving on from there, into something else.
[03:37:10.247 --> 03:37:15.169]  Again, we just came out with our new Trends Journal, and boy, there's history before it happens.
[03:37:15.169 --> 03:37:16.490]  Oh, Venezuela?
[03:37:16.490 --> 03:37:19.031]  That was in our November Trends Journal.
[03:37:19.031 --> 03:37:31.896]  We warned of a triangle of death forming between Colombia, Brazil, and Argentina, with the backing of the United States,
[03:37:32.403 --> 03:37:34.584]  To take over the Venezuelan government coup.
[03:37:34.584 --> 03:37:36.884]  We wrote about that two months ago.
[03:37:36.884 --> 03:37:38.164]  Anyway.
[03:37:38.164 --> 03:37:41.905]  Again, talking about history before it happens, as you well know.
[03:37:41.905 --> 03:37:44.186]  On the Marijuana front.
[03:37:44.186 --> 03:37:44.986]  Poof!
[03:37:44.986 --> 03:37:47.067]  We were way ahead of that.
[03:37:47.067 --> 03:37:49.387]  Yeah, reefer money madness.
[03:37:49.387 --> 03:37:51.388]  Over three years ago, we wrote about that.
[03:37:51.388 --> 03:37:54.969]  It was one of our top trends.
[03:37:54.969 --> 03:37:56.549]  And you can see where this is going.
[03:37:56.549 --> 03:38:00.250]  There's a whole lot of information in the Trends Journal about it.
[03:38:01.485 --> 03:38:05.387]  This is going to be one of the biggest businesses we've ever seen.
[03:38:05.387 --> 03:38:08.508]  Trillion dollar business worldwide.
[03:38:08.508 --> 03:38:11.670]  So I've been thinking about this.
[03:38:11.670 --> 03:38:24.455]  The criminals, the criminals who criminalized marijuana destroyed the lives of millions of people.
[03:38:24.455 --> 03:38:25.636]  Tens of millions.
[03:38:26.232 --> 03:38:33.593]  And when you add the families that were destroyed into it over the decades, probably a hundred million.
[03:38:33.593 --> 03:38:36.954]  The getting high or selling pot.
[03:38:36.954 --> 03:38:50.456]  And the brutality that the criminals used to beat up, lock up, and ruin the lives of the people caught.
[03:38:50.456 --> 03:38:53.377]  Selling pot or smoking it.
[03:38:53.377 --> 03:38:55.237]  The same criminal class
[03:38:56.704 --> 03:39:08.747]  That morons and imbeciles called Democrats and Republicans are now saying we're going to make it legal.
[03:39:08.747 --> 03:39:10.888]  They're not politicians.
[03:39:10.888 --> 03:39:12.949]  This is a gang.
[03:39:12.949 --> 03:39:15.429]  It's a mafia.
[03:39:15.429 --> 03:39:23.031]  These same low lives, like the one we have over here in New York, little Andy Cuomo.
[03:39:23.031 --> 03:39:25.252]  Yeah, Mario's boy.
[03:39:26.246 --> 03:39:33.429]  Like his son over there, other one, Chris Cuomo, on CNN, the Cartoon News Network.
[03:39:33.429 --> 03:39:38.212]  Guys born on Third Base and thought they had a home run.
[03:39:38.212 --> 03:39:45.655]  In March 2017, not ancient history, Cuomo's saying, no, we're not going to legalize it.
[03:39:45.655 --> 03:39:50.818]  Everybody knows that's as stupid and arrogant as I am.
[03:39:50.818 --> 03:39:53.599]  That marriage you want is a gateway drug.
[03:39:54.713 --> 03:39:56.793]  That's the BS he spewed out.
[03:39:56.793 --> 03:39:58.534]  Now they're legalizing it.
[03:39:58.534 --> 03:40:00.574]  The mafia is legalizing it.
[03:40:00.574 --> 03:40:02.374]  You know why?
[03:40:02.374 --> 03:40:04.915]  Because we're gonna tax you.
[03:40:04.915 --> 03:40:07.676]  Yeah, we're gonna call a tax, but it's our cut.
[03:40:07.676 --> 03:40:08.976]  You got it?
[03:40:08.976 --> 03:40:20.278]  So the same criminals, the same low-life criminals who criminalized it, are now with their arrogance saying, hey, we're gonna legalize.
[03:40:21.343 --> 03:40:28.165]  And we're going to give you the laws on what you could do, what God gave you.
[03:40:28.165 --> 03:40:33.107]  This is God's plan, but we're taking it over.
[03:40:33.107 --> 03:40:40.809]  And we're going to tell you how you could sell it, how you could grow it, and how you could take it.
[03:40:40.809 --> 03:40:42.249]  Where and when.
[03:40:42.249 --> 03:40:47.411]  And every time you do your SOB, you're going to give me my cut.
[03:40:48.189 --> 03:40:59.279]  And my cut's gonna be bigger than your cut, because I'm the mafia that morons and imbeciles call Democrats and Republicans.
[03:40:59.279 --> 03:41:12.350]  The same criminal gang, the same criminal gang that ruined the lives of tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people, are now coming out and saying, hey, we're legalizing it.
[03:41:12.350 --> 03:41:13.912]  And we're gonna tell you what to do.
[03:41:14.577 --> 03:41:22.423]  And we're going to set up all of these bureaus and all of this other stuff so you can pay taxes and we're going to give you a license.
[03:41:22.423 --> 03:41:29.368]  So we can continue to live the lives we want to live because we're only going to make the rich people richer with this.
[03:41:29.368 --> 03:41:31.770]  Because the little people aren't going to be able to afford it.
[03:41:31.770 --> 03:41:35.533]  We're going to turn it into another monopoly.
[03:41:35.533 --> 03:41:40.036]  Where's the outrage?
[03:41:40.036 --> 03:41:42.698]  How dare these little low lives
[03:41:43.374 --> 03:41:45.875]  And I gotta be equal here.
[03:41:45.875 --> 03:41:49.377]  Men and women, black and white.
[03:41:49.377 --> 03:41:51.939]  Name the religion.
[03:41:51.939 --> 03:41:53.680]  All of them.
[03:41:53.680 --> 03:42:02.684]  Telling you to do what they want you to do with the plant that God gave you.
[03:42:02.684 --> 03:42:04.485]  That's right.
[03:42:04.485 --> 03:42:06.346]  They didn't make it.
[03:42:06.346 --> 03:42:07.527]  Not a Pfizer one.
[03:42:08.354 --> 03:42:10.735]  Not the cats that made opiates.
[03:42:10.735 --> 03:42:11.915]  No.
[03:42:11.915 --> 03:42:13.316]  This is from God.
[03:42:13.316 --> 03:42:18.138]  Hey, pretty soon they're going to tell me, hey, Celente, you can't grow those tomatoes anymore.
[03:42:18.138 --> 03:42:19.999]  Get rid of that basil.
[03:42:19.999 --> 03:42:22.200]  Yeah, no more zucchini.
[03:42:22.200 --> 03:42:24.020]  We'll tell you what to do.
[03:42:24.020 --> 03:42:26.261]  Don't you know who we are?
[03:42:26.261 --> 03:42:33.264]  We're the criminal gang that morons and imbeciles call Republicans and Democrats.
[03:42:35.674 --> 03:42:40.718]  We gotta stop this before they rob us of every penny we have.
[03:42:40.718 --> 03:42:41.438]  Be back in a minute.
[03:43:02.560 --> 03:43:11.503]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:43:11.503 --> 03:43:21.645]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:43:21.645 --> 03:43:30.168]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:43:31.008 --> 03:43:32.369]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:43:32.369 --> 03:43:33.530]  You must experience it.
[03:43:33.530 --> 03:43:35.471]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:43:35.471 --> 03:43:40.514]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:43:40.514 --> 03:43:42.035]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:43:42.035 --> 03:43:43.516]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[03:43:43.516 --> 03:43:50.221]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:43:50.221 --> 03:43:51.702]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[03:43:53.359 --> 03:44:01.064]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:44:01.064 --> 03:44:14.413]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:44:14.413 --> 03:44:19.336]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[03:44:19.336 --> 03:44:22.879]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.

[03:44:54.406 --> 03:45:02.790]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:45:02.790 --> 03:45:04.251]  Believe me, I know.
[03:45:04.251 --> 03:45:08.953]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.

[03:46:18.852 --> 03:46:21.653]  I am patient zero in the mass of banning.
[03:46:21.653 --> 03:46:28.914]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.

[03:46:41.837 --> 03:46:43.337]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[03:46:43.337 --> 03:46:46.378]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[03:46:49.932 --> 03:46:52.594]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:15.580 --> 03:47:16.522]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:16.522 --> 03:47:18.606]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:26.143 --> 03:47:33.328]  He rode a blazing saddle, he wore a shining star.
[03:47:33.328 --> 03:47:39.592]  His job's war for battle, to bad men near and far.
[03:47:56.363 --> 03:47:58.224]  I got word of this from Roger.
[03:47:58.224 --> 03:48:05.027]  He was on the cover of The War Room and I said, no, Gerald Cilente is a best-selling author, former consultant, lobbyist, like Roger.
[03:48:05.027 --> 03:48:06.527]  He'll want to comment too.
[03:48:06.527 --> 03:48:12.130]  This is from Grant J. Smith, attorney at law for Roger Stone, Document Cam, Shot Police for TV viewers.
[03:48:12.930 --> 03:48:34.319]  Major breaking news here today, not just breaking Gavin McInnes' suit that Drudge Reports linked to first on the situation with the Southern Primary Law Center, but specific evidence with the time coding that lawyers got that CNN got word of the indictment before the lawyers for Roger Stone.
[03:48:34.319 --> 03:48:35.920]  That is illegal.
[03:48:36.795 --> 03:48:41.378]  That is a major jurisprudence violation in many areas, a felony.
[03:48:41.378 --> 03:48:43.779]  So we've got the metadata.
[03:48:43.779 --> 03:48:46.081]  We've got the indictment.
[03:48:46.081 --> 03:48:47.642]  We've got it all right here.
[03:48:47.642 --> 03:48:54.746]  We're going to be going over this, but this is absolutely huge, global exclusive.
[03:48:54.746 --> 03:48:56.747]  We've got Rogers Neighbors confirming.
[03:48:56.747 --> 03:48:58.468]  CNN was setting up 30 minutes before.
[03:48:58.468 --> 03:49:01.770]  We've got Senator Graham launching an investigation.
[03:49:01.770 --> 03:49:02.951]  Roger, this is a big deal.
[03:49:04.522 --> 03:49:06.863]  Well, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[03:49:06.863 --> 03:49:20.767]  This is indisputable proof that a that a CNN producer was sent a draft copy of my indictment, which was sealed a day prior to my address.
[03:49:20.767 --> 03:49:27.169]  Leaks by the special counsel's office to the media or anyone are specifically illegal.
[03:49:27.889 --> 03:49:35.012]  Uh, this is not the document that was put up on Pacer and unsealed by the government after my arrest.
[03:49:35.012 --> 03:49:46.796]  This is proven by the metadata tags to be a draft of my indictment that was sent to CNN explaining why they arrived at my home roughly 50 minutes
[03:49:47.396 --> 03:49:54.038]  Before I was arrested, that has to be the shortest stakeout in American history.
[03:49:54.038 --> 03:49:59.820]  This, I think, destroys the idea that they were operating on a hunch.
[03:49:59.820 --> 03:50:02.581]  My lawyers figured this out this morning.
[03:50:03.462 --> 03:50:17.159]  And they have forwarded this information to Senator Graham, to Congressman Mark Meadows, to Congressman Jim Jordan, to Congressman Matt Gaetz, members of the House Judiciary Committee.
[03:50:17.159 --> 03:50:19.262]  This, I think, indisputably proves
[03:50:19.702 --> 03:50:41.374]  That's what I said last week, that CNN was allowed to film the public humiliation of not only Roger Stone, but my 71-year-old wife, who is charged with no crime whatsoever, but made to stand in the street barefooted in her nightgown after this stunning pre-dawn raid on my house.
[03:50:41.374 --> 03:50:43.435]  CNN is busted.
[03:50:43.435 --> 03:50:44.896]  There is no question about this.
[03:50:45.556 --> 03:50:48.558]  Prior to this, it was an allegation.
[03:50:48.558 --> 03:50:53.781]  I think this absolutely proves that there has been a violation of the law.
[03:50:53.781 --> 03:51:01.766]  Let me bring Gerald Cilente in here, and you'll obviously be back on The War Room to cover this more, but this fits into the sloppiness where we have
[03:51:02.717 --> 03:51:18.731]  All these different FBI agents saying it's an insurance policy, let's set him up, let's illegally spy, Hillary's really my president, and then lying to Congress, and lying to the president, and lying to the courts, saying that the president wasn't the target of an espionage investigation, which they later admitted.
[03:51:18.731 --> 03:51:21.474]  They committed perjury, the thing you're charged with.
[03:51:21.474 --> 03:51:26.998]  This is sensationally obvious, and now they're such slops.
[03:51:27.859 --> 03:51:34.805]  That they send you the metadata that a day before they illegally send a sealed indictment to CNN.
[03:51:34.805 --> 03:51:41.090]  I'll go back to you in a moment, Roger, but Gerald Solente, this is exactly what you've been talking about.
[03:51:41.090 --> 03:51:43.833]  Yes, there is no media anymore.
[03:51:43.833 --> 03:51:47.776]  As I say, these are just, they're prostitutes.
[03:51:47.776 --> 03:51:53.521]  They get paid to put out by their corporate Johns and Washington whoremasters.
[03:51:53.521 --> 03:51:55.883]  And there can't be any clearer evidence than this.
[03:51:57.023 --> 03:52:01.547]  The whole Roger Stone indictment was nothing more than a Trump attack.
[03:52:01.547 --> 03:52:18.160]  And I could take the words that you would never believe where they come from, but the World Socialist Website, WSWS, this was their headline story in January 30th.
[03:52:18.160 --> 03:52:24.945]  Stone indictment presents no evidence of links between WikiLeaks and Trump campaign.
[03:52:25.638 --> 03:52:29.223]  Remember, this is the World Socialist website.
[03:52:29.223 --> 03:52:34.371]  They broke down the story and said what a sham this whole thing is.
[03:52:34.371 --> 03:52:35.653]  And they're no Trump fans.
[03:52:36.257 --> 03:52:48.331]  But they're trying to be fair in what they're saying, and how this whole thing was a staged event to discredit the Trump administration, just as they've been doing since the first day he got elected.
[03:52:48.331 --> 03:52:48.831]  That's right.
[03:52:48.831 --> 03:52:51.715]  So, Roger, thank you for breaking this huge exclusive here.
[03:52:51.715 --> 03:52:54.858]  We'll be covering more in the War Room at StoneColdTruth.com.
[03:52:54.858 --> 03:52:55.779]  We'll post this immediately.
[03:52:55.779 --> 03:52:56.981]  I'm sure Drudge is going to link to it.
[03:52:57.741 --> 03:52:58.882]  Holy Toledo!
[03:52:58.882 --> 03:53:01.483]  I mean, this is getting insane!
[03:53:01.483 --> 03:53:09.527]  Why would they publicly put the date stamp on it, send it to CNN, which is a felony, to leak a sealed indictment, and have the reporter out there?
[03:53:09.527 --> 03:53:13.489]  It just shows a brazen disregard for anything!
[03:53:13.489 --> 03:53:16.210]  These people have more chutzpah than I've ever heard of!
[03:53:17.483 --> 03:53:22.126]  Well, perhaps this was an error, but if so, it was a fatal error.
[03:53:22.126 --> 03:53:26.809]  They, as you know, executed a search warrant on my home.
[03:53:26.809 --> 03:53:41.659]  The leak of a search warrant is a very specific crime because if the person who was being searched learned about it in advance, they would have the opportunity to destroy evidence or tamper with it, something I have not done and have never done.
[03:53:42.259 --> 03:53:58.435]  But if I was supposedly dangerous, which is the premise of a 29-member strike force in SWAT gear, brandishing assault rifles surrounding my home to arrest me, then why was CNN allowed to film it?
[03:53:58.935 --> 03:54:10.443]  And they put this fellow Shortell out front, but the producer on the ground is Josh Campbell, the former Special Assistant to FBI Director James Comey, and a longtime FBI employee.
[03:54:10.443 --> 03:54:12.044]  And let's be clear, they blocked the road off.
[03:54:12.044 --> 03:54:14.345]  This guy's right in the middle of him, Gerald Celente.
[03:54:14.345 --> 03:54:16.867]  I mean, again, this level of arrogance, what do you call this, Gerald?
[03:54:16.867 --> 03:54:19.308]  Well, it's fascism.
[03:54:19.308 --> 03:54:21.049]  I mean, that's all this is.
[03:54:21.049 --> 03:54:21.950]  It's a takeover.
[03:54:23.183 --> 03:54:25.825]  It's the merger of state and corporate powers.
[03:54:25.825 --> 03:54:27.986]  And they just could not be any clearer than this.
[03:54:27.986 --> 03:54:29.546]  This is disgusting what they've done.
[03:54:29.546 --> 03:54:36.389]  The humiliation and the arrogance of these people being these tough guys all dressed up in their SWAT team.
[03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:39.531]  And I agree with you, but how did they not know it would blow up in their face?
[03:54:39.531 --> 03:54:40.811]  It's that blindness.
[03:54:40.811 --> 03:54:44.573]  It's that tone-deafness.
[03:54:44.573 --> 03:54:45.474]  Didn't they get this?
[03:54:45.474 --> 03:54:46.114]  Didn't it look good?
[03:54:48.544 --> 03:54:50.845]  Yeah, it's just disgusting.
[03:54:50.845 --> 03:54:53.525]  Again, let's go worldwide on it.
[03:54:53.525 --> 03:54:57.167]  Look what they're doing to the people in France.
[03:54:57.167 --> 03:55:06.049]  These crazy guys get all power hungry and then they become these mercenaries for these crazy people that are hiring them.
[03:55:06.049 --> 03:55:12.151]  And that's all this is, to hear that there was a former guy working for the FBI that's also now with CNN.
[03:55:12.891 --> 03:55:14.333]  How much more proof did you need?
[03:55:14.333 --> 03:55:17.798]  That was a shocking statement when I just heard it.
[03:55:17.798 --> 03:55:18.559]  It's confirmed.
[03:55:18.559 --> 03:55:21.763]  All right, Gerald, thank you for all the great work you do.
[03:55:21.763 --> 03:55:24.026]  Please join us anytime you want.
[03:55:24.026 --> 03:55:26.370]  TrendsResearch.com.
[03:55:26.370 --> 03:55:28.733]  I know, Roger, when are you going to be on The War Room next hour, Roger?
[03:55:29.782 --> 03:55:35.745]  Uh, we'll be on the war room at four o'clock central, five o'clock eastern to break this down.
[03:55:35.745 --> 03:55:45.231]  I mean, Alex, the irony of this, of course, is that the judge is considering gagging me because they don't want to poison the jury pool.
[03:55:45.231 --> 03:55:46.832]  But this raid on my house.
[03:55:47.472 --> 03:55:49.353]  Poisoned the jury pool.
[03:55:49.353 --> 03:55:50.594]  That's perfectly alright.
[03:55:50.594 --> 03:56:02.883]  This leak to CNN made me look like public enemy number one, like some kind of drug kingpin, despite the fact that I'm charged with non-violent process crimes that allegedly took place after the election.
[03:56:02.883 --> 03:56:04.965]  So let me ask you this, any word on when they may gag you?
[03:56:06.429 --> 03:56:16.552]  Well, the judge has required submissions from both the government and my attorneys by, I think it is the 5th, and I imagine there'll be a decision after that.
[03:56:16.552 --> 03:56:18.532]  So, it's ironic.
[03:56:18.532 --> 03:56:28.655]  The government is trying to paint me as public enemy number one, yet they're afraid that my defending myself and raising the money to defend myself, well, that will poison the jury.
[03:56:29.355 --> 03:56:32.279]  This judge already barred one person from raising money for the defense.
[03:56:32.279 --> 03:56:32.900]  Incredible.
[03:56:32.900 --> 03:56:34.582]  Roger, we'll talk to you in one hour.
[03:56:34.582 --> 03:56:35.503]  One hour into the war room.
[03:56:35.503 --> 03:56:39.308]  In closing, Gerald Cilente, this is not the America we're supposed to be in, is it?
[03:56:40.231 --> 03:56:42.012]  No, it's disgusting what's going on.
[03:56:42.012 --> 03:56:43.353]  How could they do that?
[03:56:43.353 --> 03:56:46.014]  And how come there's no outrage about this?
[03:56:46.014 --> 03:56:48.976]  This is what they did to Roger Stone.
[03:56:48.976 --> 03:56:53.839]  And this is a man of, you know, well-renowned, and again, he's no criminal here.
[03:56:53.839 --> 03:56:55.480]  Look what they're doing to other people, too.
[03:56:55.480 --> 03:57:00.063]  No wonder why so many homes are broken into and innocent people are being killed.
[03:57:00.063 --> 03:57:03.305]  And with all this kind of madness, this has to stop.
[03:57:03.305 --> 03:57:04.866]  This isn't what this country's about.
[03:57:06.184 --> 03:57:07.144]  Wow, okay.
[03:57:07.144 --> 03:57:12.067]  TrendsResearch.com, StoneColdTruth.com, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:57:12.067 --> 03:57:16.248]  And Gerald, please join me in the next week on my regular show, because I want to get your take.
[03:57:16.248 --> 03:57:18.169]  You've been really predicting the economy.
[03:57:18.169 --> 03:57:19.950]  You've been predicting Venezuela.
[03:57:19.950 --> 03:57:21.030]  I want to get you on.
[03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:24.432]  This is the main show right now, but on with me the next few days if we can do it.
[03:57:24.432 --> 03:57:28.013]  And Roger, you too, you're coming up to the War Room right after this.
[03:57:28.013 --> 03:57:28.874]  Okay, that's it.
[03:57:30.017 --> 03:57:32.719]  For this live transmission, tomorrow's news today.
[03:57:32.719 --> 03:57:34.620]  Remember, we're being censored and blocked.
[03:57:34.620 --> 03:57:36.482]  Only you can move the ball down the field.
[03:57:36.482 --> 03:57:37.322]  When you do it, we win.
[03:57:37.322 --> 03:57:41.105]  So take the links, take the articles, share them on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.
[03:57:41.105 --> 03:57:42.126]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:57:46.021 --> 03:57:49.062]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[03:57:49.062 --> 03:57:55.483]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[03:57:55.483 --> 03:58:10.965]  Turbo Force from Info Wars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.
[03:58:10.965 --> 03:58:14.686]  Simply take a packet, mix it into the indicated amount of water, and enjoy!

[03:58:44.471 --> 03:58:52.156]  At InfoWars, we're always looking for the very best, best-selling, highest-rated products that we can then private label and sell.
[03:58:52.156 --> 03:59:05.525]  Well, there is a national company who has FDA approval to sell their wound gel that is the strongest out there, and we private label it, and we sell it for $10 less online than they sell it at CVS and Walgreens.
[03:59:05.525 --> 03:59:10.428]  We also have another product, also produced by the same company, Immune Gargle.
[03:59:10.428 --> 03:59:14.011]  We've been selling a lot of the wound gel and a lot of the Immune Gargle.
