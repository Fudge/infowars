[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.922]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.224 --> 00:00:27.667]  In the 90s, Mar-a-Lago was Trump's South Florida party palace, one frequented by Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:00:27.807 --> 00:00:30.188]  Today, Donald Trump has three friends in jail.
[00:00:30.308 --> 00:00:32.969]  Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, and now Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:39.992]  Donald Trump with Jeffrey Epstein, who is now a sex offender and accused sex trafficker.
[00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:48.926]  The mainstream media is focused on the connections between President Trump and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:54.998]  And yet, they ignore the biggest part of the Epstein story.
[00:00:56.218 --> 00:01:04.864]  The thing about Jeffrey Epstein is that he is connected to a long list of some of the most influential and powerful people in the world.
[00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:12.810]  Influential media names such as Rupert Murdoch, George Stephanopoulos, Woody Allen,
[00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:22.232]  And actor Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexually assaulting a minor and was a frequent guest to Epstein's pedophile island.
[00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:34.135]  World elites such as Prince Andrew, Lynn Forrester de Rothschild, Sarah Ferguson, the Count and Countess of the House of Bismarck,
[00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:47.893]  And the Sultan of Brunei, Hassanal Bolkiah, who was accused of drugging and raping a group of women who were hired for promotional work, including Miss USA 1997.
[00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:54.020]  The case was dismissed on the grounds that Bolkiah had sovereign immunity.
[00:01:55.367 --> 00:02:03.590]  Jeffrey Epstein is closely connected to President Bill Clinton, as well as his daughter Chelsea, and his former National Security Advisor.
[00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:11.154]  He has connections to several other politicians, including Chuck Schumer, Ted Kennedy, and John Kerry.
[00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:20.998]  Jeffrey Epstein served on the Council on Foreign Relations with Henry Kissinger, and on the Rockefeller University Board with Nancy Kissinger.
[00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:27.641]  ...and provided services to Saudi Arabian arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi.
[00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:41.996]  Epstein's private island, known as Pedophile Island by the locals, is located in the biggest hotbed of the human sex trade, and is just miles away from neighbor and friend Richard Branson.
[00:02:42.937 --> 00:02:57.206]  Epstein is associated with Edgar Bronfman, the father of Claire Bronfman, who is also Epstein's neighbor in the Caribbean and is a major part of the Nixxiom cult, who has been charged with child porn and human trafficking.
[00:02:59.147 --> 00:03:04.951]  Jeffrey Epstein's Zorro Ranch property in New Mexico was purchased from Governor Bruce King in 1993.
[00:03:08.126 --> 00:03:13.167]  And is insulated on all sides by properties owned by the powerful King family.
[00:03:16.108 --> 00:03:20.249]  It is a mystery how Jeffrey Epstein acquired his wealth and influence.
[00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.530]  But the most simple explanation seems to be sex trafficking and blackmail.
[00:03:28.971 --> 00:03:33.192]  Alexander Acosta claimed that Epstein belonged to intelligence.
[00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:43.579]  With all of the power and influence involved, it seems it will take a miracle for the Jeffrey Epstein case to ever see justice.
[00:03:45.701 --> 00:03:48.124]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:05.084]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:06.945]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:04:07.385 --> 00:04:08.646]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:04:09.407 --> 00:04:13.509]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:23.216]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:04:23.236 --> 00:04:28.219]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:32.002]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:40.810]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.571]  I have no issue with it at all.
[00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:43.852]  I want them shut down.
[00:04:43.912 --> 00:04:44.833]  I want them silenced.
[00:04:44.873 --> 00:04:45.674]  I want them muted.
[00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:47.535]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:04:48.857 --> 00:04:50.238]  I want them shut down!
[00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:51.779]  I want them silenced!
[00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:52.580]  I want them muted!
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.741]  But don't worry.
[00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:56.023]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:05.022]  The globalist... It's happening now.
[00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:06.123]  Right now.
[00:05:06.863 --> 00:05:13.426]  All over the world, humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist, globalist, world government, Mark of the Beast agenda.
[00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:19.190]  The forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the spear, InfoWars, more than ever.
[00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:29.076]  Well, we're doing a special 40-hour broadcast to get new projects we've developed up and into orbit, and to take action at the next level.
[00:05:29.757 --> 00:05:36.121]  The globalists know we've already devastated them, and they hope that you don't take action, because when you support InfoWars, you change the world.
[00:05:36.921 --> 00:05:41.362]  Find coverage at clownworld.us and at infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:51.845]  But whatever you do, join us during this special 40-hour broadcast that's happening right now and spread the word because that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech censors.
[00:05:52.165 --> 00:05:56.607]  Again, infowars.com forward slash show or clownworld.us.
[00:05:56.907 --> 00:05:57.547]  Please take action.
[00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:08.315]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:13.942]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:53.207]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live, Wednesday, July 31st, 2019, global transmission.
[00:06:53.507 --> 00:07:04.453]  Despite all the attacks by the establishment, thanks to your support, we're here, in some ways more effective and stronger than others, but certainly, embattled.
[00:07:05.414 --> 00:07:09.236]  Okay, I would like to be able to focus here today
[00:07:11.136 --> 00:07:24.965]  On the incredibly boring, but at the same time horrifying, second round of the Democrat debates that kicked off last night in Detroit, Michigan.
[00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:27.827]  I would really like to do that, and we're going to be doing that.
[00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:37.314]  And we have, as you can see as a TV viewer, satellite feed directly into the main circus ring.
[00:07:38.823 --> 00:07:42.284]  It's part of our Clown World Part 2 global coverage.
[00:07:42.825 --> 00:07:48.507]  Quite frankly, last night, I was up here for part of the live broadcast that we'll be doing tonight.
[00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:51.468]  This one should be even more lively with Joe Biden being attacked.
[00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:55.190]  But it was nauseating to watch.
[00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.211]  And in fact, at one point, anybody who wanted to tune in to another place could.
[00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:04.714]  I just cut away for 20 minutes at a time because I just couldn't watch it and couldn't listen to it.
[00:08:06.247 --> 00:08:26.359]  I drove home, watched the rest of our coverage till we ended at past midnight, and then of course we came back live this morning at 5 a.m., so we're having a 40-hour marathon transmission right now that we're in the middle of, but I then went through the highlights and the lowlights of it all, and it's just unbelievable.
[00:08:27.239 --> 00:08:28.400]  This is communism.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.761]  This is authoritarianism.
[00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:31.202]  This is evil.
[00:08:32.322 --> 00:08:33.563]  This is enslavement.
[00:08:37.563 --> 00:08:56.968]  And there is no doubt that these individuals are absolutely financed and paid and put into their positions of power to sabotage and bring this nation down.
[00:08:56.988 --> 00:08:59.329]  I mean, that's what's going on here.
[00:09:01.729 --> 00:09:04.870]  And I know all of you know that, but we really need to let that burn in.
[00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:07.906]  Let that burn in.
[00:09:11.368 --> 00:09:28.374]  Now let's play a clip first of Marianne Williamson, the New Ager, who in a Drudge poll won, a Google poll won, a bunch of other polls won by a huge margin, even though she was given the least amount of time, and even though they say this is her last debate.
[00:09:29.594 --> 00:09:31.495]  Now why was it that she was so popular?
[00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:34.476]  Because she was the only one that was genuine.
[00:09:35.276 --> 00:09:36.517]  She was genuinely wrong,
[00:09:39.457 --> 00:09:44.178]  She was genuinely saying a lot of things that weren't true.
[00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:47.239]  But she meant well.
[00:09:47.279 --> 00:09:49.719]  It was from a position of a useful idiot.
[00:09:50.439 --> 00:09:52.120]  But at least there was humanity there.
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.500]  The wooden-ness.
[00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.101]  The plastic-ness of the others.
[00:09:56.181 --> 00:10:00.682]  Even when Bernie tried to act up real and upset, it just came off as bossy.
[00:10:02.222 --> 00:10:06.643]  The mechanical-ness of this whole thing
[00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:13.914]  Really made people recoil, but these are the slaves of the globalists.
[00:10:13.934 --> 00:10:22.941]  These are the people on the Mega Bank payroll, and the big multinational payroll, the UN payroll, the IMF payroll, and the Chicom payroll.
[00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:24.202]  These are the America haters.
[00:10:24.242 --> 00:10:31.828]  So, this is the type of knuckle-dragon trash, the type of poison being injected into America's veins to bring us down.
[00:10:32.549 --> 00:10:36.572]  Now, I would love, as I said, to cover all these lowlights first.
[00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:46.911]  And we're going to get to some right now, but at the bottom of the hour, I'm going to cover the big stories.
[00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:50.752]  And that's global conflict is shimmering over.
[00:10:52.612 --> 00:11:07.556]  China is making its move under their dictator who has more power than Mao Zedong, Xi, and is massing troops on the bridge preparing to invade Hong Kong.
[00:11:09.153 --> 00:11:19.580]  We reported on this on Sunday, but now it's in the Australian news, it's in the US news, and the Pentagon says that indeed that's what has happened.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.822]  They've already had Chinese troops come in in plain clothes.
[00:11:24.011 --> 00:11:38.457]  And attack the folks that don't want to be fully absorbed in the mainland under an extradition law that allows them to be arrested and disappeared like regular Chinese citizens and taken back to the mainland for organ harvesting.
[00:11:39.037 --> 00:11:40.717]  I'm not kidding, that's what the riots are about.
[00:11:41.298 --> 00:11:43.118]  And the fact that people are already disappearing.
[00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:50.781]  So if you think Tiananmen Square was a big massacre in the capital of the Chinese hellhole back in 1989,
[00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:54.763]  This is going to be horrible.
[00:11:56.584 --> 00:11:59.106]  And it's going to be spectacularly bigger.
[00:12:00.807 --> 00:12:03.549]  So the government's Qaikong run in Hong Kong.
[00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.271]  And they've already killed a bunch of people.
[00:12:08.492 --> 00:12:10.913]  But now it's about to go supernova.
[00:12:11.253 --> 00:12:13.795]  And there's a bunch of other big conflicts taking place.
[00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:17.617]  These stories are all up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:12:18.398 --> 00:12:19.178]  Crackdown coming.
[00:12:19.518 --> 00:12:22.220]  China gathers forces on Hong Kong border amid unrest.
[00:12:23.905 --> 00:12:27.406]  We just witnessed three major developments that could easily lead to global war.
[00:12:29.227 --> 00:12:31.528]  I'm going to cover all that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:32.608 --> 00:12:42.551]  But first, let's go ahead and play this clip where Marianne Williamson talks about dark psychic forces.
[00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:49.874]  Now, she's projecting who she is serving, who brought her there to speak.
[00:12:52.717 --> 00:13:08.620]  But when she keeps showing up in the polls, right up there with the Congresswoman from Hawaii, the system is preparing to remove them because they resonate too much truth.
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:20.362]  But notice, she says because the government doesn't care about you and rich, powerful, racist forces want to hurt you, they don't care and are giving you bad water.
[00:13:21.342 --> 00:13:22.302]  It's very easy.
[00:13:23.939 --> 00:13:26.781]  To purify water in areas like Michigan.
[00:13:28.403 --> 00:13:50.521]  But because the IMF and World Bank got international laws passed, we're under their regulations, you have to put giant expensive systems in that don't even clean it, and then they add chemicals, chlorine, and all this other garbage to it, and hydrofluorosilicic acid from all over the world is shipped in here as a toxic waste and added to the water.
[00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:51.802]  76% of our water is fluoridated.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.621]  So, oh, I'm the, you know, oh, there's poisons in the water guy, I'm the kook, but it's everywhere, it's true.
[00:13:59.841 --> 00:14:09.323]  So she's blaming Trump, saying he won't fix the water, when Trump is not doing any of that.
[00:14:10.123 --> 00:14:19.725]  And the so-called Clean Water Act and all of that, is a smokescreen for the fact that they take control of our water and put poison in it, and Trump's saying let local governments decide
[00:14:21.343 --> 00:14:22.626]  What's best and how they want to do it.
[00:14:23.047 --> 00:14:23.928]  So here's part of the clip.
[00:14:25.233 --> 00:14:25.373]  Ms.
[00:14:25.413 --> 00:14:28.194]  Williamson, what's your response on the Flint water crisis?
[00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:32.696]  My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:14:33.156 --> 00:14:38.537]  I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina, where there is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint.
[00:14:39.018 --> 00:14:42.099]  We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act.
[00:14:42.499 --> 00:14:50.361]  We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country, who are suffering from environmental injustice.
[00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:52.142]  I assure you, I lived in Grosse Pointe.
[00:14:52.302 --> 00:14:54.703]  What happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe.
[00:14:55.003 --> 00:14:59.387]  This is part of the dark underbelly of American society.
[00:14:59.447 --> 00:15:03.491]  The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that we're having here tonight.
[00:15:03.732 --> 00:15:15.283]  If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I'm afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days.
[00:15:15.503 --> 00:15:16.744]  We need to say it like it is.
[00:15:16.985 --> 00:15:18.006]  It's bigger than Flint.
[00:15:18.266 --> 00:15:19.367]  It's all over this country.
[00:15:19.427 --> 00:15:20.748]  It's particularly people of color.
[00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:23.451]  It's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back.
[00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:27.896]  And if the Democrats don't start saying it, then why would those people feel that they're there for us?
[00:15:28.196 --> 00:15:32.320]  And if those people don't feel it, they won't vote for us, and Donald Trump will win.
[00:15:33.161 --> 00:15:34.943]  So Donald Trump, he's poison in the water.
[00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:37.806]  Not the Democrats and the globalists that set all this up.
[00:15:39.353 --> 00:15:42.376]  And by the way, remember David Hogg attacked me for saying you should filter your water?
[00:15:42.456 --> 00:15:44.358]  And then he goes, and he sells water filters.
[00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:47.942]  He's trying to make money absolutely off doing something good.
[00:15:48.523 --> 00:15:49.684]  You can't trust the government.
[00:15:49.704 --> 00:15:50.825]  You can't trust the globalists.
[00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:56.711]  You've got to filter your own water yourself and the water you shower in if you want to live longer.
[00:16:02.585 --> 00:16:18.324]  Before I started working at InfoWars I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com and there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[00:16:18.564 --> 00:16:22.089]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests
[00:16:22.469 --> 00:16:25.933]  Tell-O-Meres and Tell-O-Mere support with your DNA.
[00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:34.743]  So I started to look into the science and what Tell-O-Meres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your Tell-O-Meres.
[00:16:34.763 --> 00:16:36.906]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but
[00:16:37.406 --> 00:16:38.086]  It's expensive.
[00:16:38.166 --> 00:16:38.426]  Why?
[00:16:38.486 --> 00:16:40.987]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:48.209]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support, and they came and they went.
[00:16:48.549 --> 00:16:51.249]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[00:16:51.589 --> 00:16:52.830]  It is the elite supplement.
[00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:56.911]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[00:16:56.951 --> 00:17:02.792]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:17:03.072 --> 00:17:08.375]  George Orwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:17:09.016 --> 00:17:11.457]  And so, used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag.
[00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:15.740]  Because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.922]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools.
[00:17:19.162 --> 00:17:20.843]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[00:17:21.404 --> 00:17:26.247]  Weird white leftists that want to virtue signal are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[00:17:26.887 --> 00:17:29.229]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:44.844]  So now it is a revolutionary act at a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly when it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, America's back, Infowars.com.
[00:17:45.885 --> 00:17:53.052]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies' face all over, not just the U.S., but worldwide.
[00:17:53.212 --> 00:17:56.495]  Because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:14.255]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[00:18:14.335 --> 00:18:22.961]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[00:18:23.202 --> 00:18:27.225]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[00:18:27.885 --> 00:18:34.229]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:36.430]  And you may be experiencing backup too.

[00:20:06.894 --> 00:20:09.675]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.416 --> 00:20:18.297]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:20:18.837 --> 00:20:31.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.441]  There are never any slow news days.
[00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:36.081]  There haven't been
[00:20:38.317 --> 00:20:39.378]  The 25 years I've been on air.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.302]  Because we don't just go off whatever mainstream media says the big story of the day is.
[00:20:46.062 --> 00:20:48.384]  But sometimes whatever the big story of the day is, we will focus on.
[00:20:50.105 --> 00:20:51.686]  Well, there are a lot of big stories of the day here.
[00:20:52.007 --> 00:20:53.287]  Next segment, I'm going to get into it.
[00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:56.670]  China is massing troops to invade Hong Kong.
[00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.492]  They've already invaded with plainclothes paramilitary.
[00:21:00.589 --> 00:21:01.970]  You think Tiananmen Square was bad?
[00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:04.052]  Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:21:04.072 --> 00:21:11.597]  In fact, let's queue up Tiananmen Square footage, if we can, of the famous tank man and the rest of it for next segment, because that's where we're going.
[00:21:12.458 --> 00:21:19.603]  They're also threatening to invade Taiwan, as Trump just sold $2 billion of anti-ship missiles to them.
[00:21:24.666 --> 00:21:29.570]  Now, that's all coming up next segment.
[00:21:33.576 --> 00:21:44.484]  Let me just tell you what else I'm going to be covering throughout the broadcast and what's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com that I'm here looking at.
[00:21:45.184 --> 00:21:56.492]  Starting a week ago and now right through to today, there have been a whole bunch of mainstream publications come out and apologize to Trump.
[00:21:57.913 --> 00:21:59.014]  And that's a really good thing.
[00:22:00.309 --> 00:22:03.651]  And apologize for Russiagate admitting it's fake.
[00:22:04.792 --> 00:22:11.117]  And a big federal judge in New York just threw out a DNC lawsuit against Trump saying he's basically a Russian agent.
[00:22:11.637 --> 00:22:21.204]  And the Democrat judge appointed by Bill Clinton said, none of what's in your lawsuit represents anything happening in reality, close quote.
[00:22:22.264 --> 00:22:24.826]  And that article is up on InfoWars.com.
[00:22:25.406 --> 00:22:28.969]  So we're going to go over some of those.
[00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:48.579]  Coming up in the fifth segment of this hour, but... The bigger question is... What about everybody that got deplatformed in the name of being Russian agents or Russian bots?
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:56.482]  What about all the hearings where they'd have the CIA, leftists from the CIA, testify that I'm a Russian agent and I'm gonna be taken off the air?
[00:22:56.702 --> 00:23:00.263]  That's what all this media disinfo and all these attacks has been!
[00:23:01.596 --> 00:23:07.719]  That's why it resembled the type of propaganda you see before a war against a country we're going to invade.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.642]  That's because Obama legalized using the CIA against the American people seven years ago.
[00:23:13.742 --> 00:23:14.843]  The New York Post reported on it.
[00:23:17.684 --> 00:23:21.667]  Obama and Congress legalized domestic propaganda and the CIA.
[00:23:22.487 --> 00:23:23.808]  So I'm not a victim here.
[00:23:24.888 --> 00:23:29.711]  I'm a target because I've been effective telling the truth because I'm a loyal American, but criminal globalist
[00:23:31.391 --> 00:23:47.681]  In control of our weaponized systems have been waging war against the American people and it's taken Trump almost three years to just get some control over the executive branch.
[00:23:49.542 --> 00:23:54.925]  So I'm not here saying that I need
[00:23:56.653 --> 00:23:58.294]  Really, though that would be nice.
[00:23:59.315 --> 00:24:14.185]  I'm saying to the President, and the Pentagon, and some of the better people in those agencies, who understand how dangerous this is to the country and the world, and understand that Obama was allied with the Chi-Coms and others, that this has got to be removed out of our system if we've got any hope of a future.
[00:24:14.485 --> 00:24:18.328]  But you can't leave these people in place, because they're so dug in.
[00:24:19.608 --> 00:24:27.571]  And then not know they're not going to keep leaking this info, keep sabotaging the recovery, and keep coming after you as well.
[00:24:29.431 --> 00:24:34.833]  And that's what Admiral Rogers went and told Trump when he was president-elect.
[00:24:35.893 --> 00:24:43.876]  And we knew through sources at Trump Tower at that time that Trump had been told he was being illegally spied on.
[00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:47.937]  That's why we broke it all in and around the inauguration.
[00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:54.530]  So, this is the real deal.
[00:24:55.891 --> 00:24:58.694]  Why do you think so many people in media rolled over to the intimidation?
[00:24:58.754 --> 00:25:00.095]  Because they'll dox your family.
[00:25:02.157 --> 00:25:06.461]  They will threaten those that work with you.
[00:25:07.342 --> 00:25:08.924]  They will take your credit ratings away.
[00:25:10.105 --> 00:25:11.966]  They will physically attack you.
[00:25:12.006 --> 00:25:12.787]  They will set you up.
[00:25:12.827 --> 00:25:13.988]  They will try to put you in prison.
[00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:16.611]  You know, why do you think
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:22.083]  The Pentagon computers have more child porn on it than any other government computers.
[00:25:22.143 --> 00:25:24.305]  It's not because the Pentagon's looking at porn.
[00:25:25.706 --> 00:25:27.167]  I reported on this 20 years ago.
[00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.790]  Or child porn, for that matter.
[00:25:31.151 --> 00:25:34.794]  They know all those computers are heavily watched, even if they wanted to look at that crap.
[00:25:35.234 --> 00:25:35.614]  That evil.
[00:25:37.416 --> 00:25:44.661]  It came out, I learned, almost 20 years ago, that they were going around on people's computers planting it with viruses that the CIA had
[00:25:45.814 --> 00:25:51.881]  And then they come in and tell the officers and people, well, this was found and we know it's probably not you, but everything's going to be okay.
[00:25:52.943 --> 00:25:54.264]  But we need you to work with us.
[00:25:56.627 --> 00:25:57.929]  Just like we got the calls.
[00:25:58.509 --> 00:26:00.472]  Oh, some child porn got found in your email.
[00:26:00.512 --> 00:26:02.034]  But don't worry, they're not going to say anything.
[00:26:02.514 --> 00:26:03.495]  But they do want to talk.
[00:26:04.745 --> 00:26:06.126]  Oh, you want to talk?
[00:26:06.546 --> 00:26:18.852]  Like I'm scared of somebody sending me that crap, and then you subpoena it and scan it and find it hidden in digital code, and then, oh, but you let me know you know about it, but just, just, just, just sit tight, Alex.
[00:26:20.073 --> 00:26:20.773]  Yeah, right.
[00:26:20.793 --> 00:26:22.094]  Well, you saw what happened, didn't you?
[00:26:23.134 --> 00:26:25.316]  Gun's a blazing bitch.
[00:26:27.697 --> 00:26:29.177]  Feel your political hand.
[00:26:30.738 --> 00:26:31.719]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[00:26:34.571 --> 00:26:39.033]  You think four against a fat man is a dog fall?
[00:26:40.394 --> 00:26:48.897]  You guys have been living around your own cowardice so long, I'm talking the establishment, that you don't know what real resistance is when it's looking at you straight in the eyes.
[00:26:49.618 --> 00:26:52.559]  But I'll tell listeners this as we go to break and come back with the really important news.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.462]  That there has been a huge move to compromise everybody in this country.
[00:26:59.389 --> 00:27:00.550]  And to intimidate everyone.
[00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.571]  And this idea of just bow down to it.
[00:27:02.852 --> 00:27:06.815]  Let pedophiles have access to your kids in the schools and libraries or we'll call you a name.
[00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:09.857]  Don't say mother or father or we'll call you a name.
[00:27:11.098 --> 00:27:14.220]  Don't do this or that or we'll come after you.
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.022]  Well let's just get it on then!
[00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.512]  Let's get the party started, and we have politically.
[00:27:20.152 --> 00:27:27.738]  You know, I told Mueller over a year ago that he would be destroyed politically, and I would expose him for protecting Epstein and the pedophiles.
[00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:28.919]  It's all over the news today.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:44.552]  I told you, Mueller, I'd meet you at high noon politically, and that you and your controller trying to set me up as a Russian would go to hell before I ever bowed to your un-American, globalist, deep state souls.
[00:27:46.175 --> 00:27:52.538]  That's why we are supported by the listeners, and that's why we continue to let them know that they are the only reason we're still on air.
[00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:57.860]  You are the InfoWar viewers and listeners, and we need you, now more than ever.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.722]  But when I get in people's faces like Robert Mueller, I don't do that to act macho.
[00:28:03.822 --> 00:28:09.905]  I do it because everyone's afraid of people like him, and somebody's got to call their bluff, like Toto pulling back the curtain.
[00:28:12.128 --> 00:28:17.771]  Toto wasn't that big or strong, a little black dog, but was willing to pull the curtain back and wasn't afraid.
[00:28:18.691 --> 00:28:20.492]  And that's what leadership's all about.
[00:28:20.752 --> 00:28:27.895]  And now when you saw the little man behind the curtain, he was frail and shaking and didn't know what to do and resembled Gargamel.
[00:28:29.956 --> 00:28:32.257]  His cat, Esmeralda, is more scary.
[00:28:33.838 --> 00:28:38.981]  It's always the minion that's more dangerous than the master.
[00:28:39.001 --> 00:28:39.561]  Darth Vader.
[00:28:41.795 --> 00:28:42.675]  Emperor Palpatine.
[00:28:43.496 --> 00:28:45.117]  Fiction playing off reality.
[00:28:46.177 --> 00:28:49.639]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, where are they now?
[00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:54.362]  All their intimidation, all their threats, just have to be caught.
[00:28:55.422 --> 00:28:58.384]  And if I die in the process, so is life.
[00:28:59.504 --> 00:29:00.465]  And point by eye.
[00:29:00.525 --> 00:29:04.147]  But in the end... This is important.
[00:29:05.467 --> 00:29:05.907]  I'm 45 years old.
[00:29:07.776 --> 00:29:10.757]  When I was 35, I swam up to 2 miles a day sometimes.
[00:29:11.397 --> 00:29:12.277]  And would jog.
[00:29:12.977 --> 00:29:13.817]  And couldn't lose weight.
[00:29:14.657 --> 00:29:17.218]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[00:29:17.418 --> 00:29:21.998]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:27.839]  I knew all about the private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, and the pedophile rings.
[00:29:28.159 --> 00:29:33.120]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the chi-coms in.
[00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.041]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:36.601]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[00:29:38.191 --> 00:29:42.014]  I didn't know about all this, and I didn't know about clean iodine.
[00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:44.697]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[00:29:45.798 --> 00:29:54.045]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[00:29:54.865 --> 00:30:00.931]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[00:30:00.951 --> 00:30:02.472]  Let me tell you something right now.
[00:30:03.793 --> 00:30:04.594]  You see DNA Force?
[00:30:05.686 --> 00:30:07.267]  I went out to top manufacturers.
[00:30:07.307 --> 00:30:09.107]  They're the most respected, most highly tested.
[00:30:09.888 --> 00:30:18.991]  And I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[00:30:19.931 --> 00:30:22.432]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each model.
[00:30:22.952 --> 00:30:24.353]  I said, I want to put $50 model in it.
[00:30:25.663 --> 00:30:27.264]  They said nobody's ever done that.
[00:30:27.344 --> 00:30:30.026]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was gonna buy.
[00:30:30.286 --> 00:30:33.548]  I got it down to thirty-something dollars a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:35.249]  Nobody does that!
[00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:42.414]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this, and you research every ingredient in this, and then you experience it for yourself.
[00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:43.975]  It's incredible.
[00:30:45.916 --> 00:30:56.691]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[00:30:57.292 --> 00:30:59.735]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:31:04.983 --> 00:31:05.183]  Yes.
[00:31:05.403 --> 00:31:07.685]  I got a plug for the Patriot Points.
[00:31:07.745 --> 00:31:08.025]  I did.
[00:31:08.505 --> 00:31:08.905]  Oh, thanks.
[00:31:08.945 --> 00:31:12.287]  I got $180 so far this year in Patriot Points, and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[00:31:12.948 --> 00:31:15.989]  I buy so much in the store because, I mean, I don't want to give that money to Walmart.
[00:31:16.069 --> 00:31:19.191]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't believe in.
[00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:20.432]  So I'd rather give that money to
[00:31:20.552 --> 00:31:22.374]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[00:31:22.414 --> 00:31:24.356]  I've never really done marketing, but I did
[00:31:41.551 --> 00:31:45.893]  Bring in a few advertising people a few years ago who knew how to advertise online.
[00:31:45.913 --> 00:31:48.433]  And they said, Mr. Jones, they said, what's your markup?
[00:31:48.553 --> 00:31:49.334]  And I said, 150%.
[00:31:50.054 --> 00:31:51.274]  But we always discount 25%.
[00:31:51.975 --> 00:31:52.235]  So that's 100%.
[00:31:52.275 --> 00:31:53.655]  And they said, yeah.
[00:31:53.775 --> 00:31:54.996]  And then you're always discounting 20, 30%.
[00:31:55.116 --> 00:31:57.837]  And then we notice you only sell stuff when it's at 50%.
[00:31:58.677 --> 00:32:00.138]  And then you're barely making any money.
[00:32:00.298 --> 00:32:01.459]  You need to stop that.
[00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:04.562]  And they looked at our data and they said, oh, your audience would buy it if it was even more.
[00:32:04.582 --> 00:32:06.304]  And I said, I want high quality stuff in there.
[00:32:06.764 --> 00:32:07.565]  I want a good price.
[00:32:08.085 --> 00:32:13.750]  But I've kind of habituated everybody, trained everybody, myself done this, to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:15.531]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[00:32:16.172 --> 00:32:19.075]  Because there's no fillers, it's concentrated, it's got iodine, a little silver.
[00:32:19.235 --> 00:32:22.739]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil, or the turmeric, or the bone broth.
[00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:26.483]  I mean, DNA Force, I signed a multi-year contract on that.
[00:32:26.523 --> 00:32:29.346]  So I was able to cut the price about 40% of what we were paying.
[00:32:29.466 --> 00:32:32.429]  It's still got 30-something dollars of product in it.
[00:32:32.469 --> 00:32:37.291]  I mean, you talk about cleaning your cells out, you talk about energy stamina, you talk about letting the telomeres last longer.
[00:32:37.411 --> 00:32:38.771]  This is patented to do that.
[00:32:38.971 --> 00:32:42.172]  And nobody puts this much of the real organic stuff in it.
[00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:44.133]  So yes, DNA Force is amazing.
[00:32:44.253 --> 00:32:45.213]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[00:32:45.233 --> 00:32:49.315]  But listen, when people get the Patriot Points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[00:32:49.435 --> 00:32:57.937]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto-ship, and then we're doing 30% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot Points, we lose money.
[00:32:57.957 --> 00:32:58.538]  But that's okay.
[00:32:58.598 --> 00:32:59.198]  Thanks for the support.
[00:33:06.431 --> 00:33:09.193]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:20.399 --> 00:33:26.403]  Big Brother Mainstream Media Government Cover-Ups
[00:33:27.876 --> 00:33:28.837]  You want answers?
[00:33:29.798 --> 00:33:30.818]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:31.719 --> 00:33:38.024]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.846 --> 00:33:46.070]  All the chickens are coming home to roost.
[00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.352]  New York Area Fire Commissioners make history.
[00:33:49.452 --> 00:33:52.735]  Call for new 9-11 investigation.
[00:33:54.045 --> 00:33:57.968]  Into what really happened, because the official story, is it true?
[00:33:58.549 --> 00:34:01.091]  And they all know there were bombs in all three buildings.
[00:34:02.172 --> 00:34:03.773]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:34:04.593 --> 00:34:06.755]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:34:07.956 --> 00:34:11.079]  Just like the whole Jeffrey Epstein thing.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:17.564]  Robert Mueller, and others, and the Clintons, using it to blackmail people with Obama.
[00:34:18.942 --> 00:34:20.423]  I'm going to detail all that in the third hour.
[00:34:21.244 --> 00:34:25.927]  And notice what I told you ten years ago, six years ago, and last year.
[00:34:27.188 --> 00:34:35.933]  I knew that I had to say something like, I'll meet Robert Mueller at high noon, politically, non-violently, with Spaghetti Western music playing in the background.
[00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:40.436]  And when I pull my gun, if he pulls his, I'm politically going to defeat him.
[00:34:41.517 --> 00:34:46.961]  Because he supported framing people with having sex with children.
[00:34:48.266 --> 00:34:48.826]  Setting them up.
[00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:50.247]  Many opted into it.
[00:34:51.708 --> 00:34:56.211]  And I knew the media would only take the pedophile news that was true.
[00:34:57.111 --> 00:35:00.173]  Now they were using pedophilia to blackmail scumbags.
[00:35:02.334 --> 00:35:10.179]  If I added the High Noon piece, and made it very clear that I wasn't talking about physical violence against Robert Mueller III,
[00:35:11.578 --> 00:35:15.542]  But they were so deceptive they still edited it and took the bait!
[00:35:17.103 --> 00:35:21.387]  And so, it's just amazing how ridiculous the establishment is.
[00:35:22.087 --> 00:35:25.570]  Now, that was back still a year ago when they hadn't figured out what I was doing.
[00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:28.853]  Now they just know to not quote anything I say and keep their mouth shut.
[00:35:29.934 --> 00:35:34.238]  And never actually quote what I say, just make up completely separate total lies.
[00:35:34.258 --> 00:35:37.081]  Because there's always traps with whatever I've sent them.
[00:35:38.933 --> 00:35:39.953]  And they're starting to figure that out.
[00:35:40.754 --> 00:35:46.056]  Like with their stupid attempt with child porn.
[00:35:46.117 --> 00:35:48.658]  These damn devil-worshippers are not that smart, folks.
[00:35:48.678 --> 00:35:53.080]  Just people aren't willing to take them on because their roaring is so loud.
[00:35:55.481 --> 00:36:01.124]  Satan goes about like a lion, roaring, seeing who he may devour.
[00:36:01.984 --> 00:36:04.766]  You know, I used to go see movies when I was a kid, like Friday the 13th and
[00:36:06.738 --> 00:36:10.239]  Jason pulls the knife out, puts her knife, they just fall down and crawl, go, No!
[00:36:10.419 --> 00:36:10.879]  Please!
[00:36:11.019 --> 00:36:11.699]  Oh, God!
[00:36:12.219 --> 00:36:13.620]  I always thought that that's ridiculous.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.480]  You'd run or you'd fight.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:24.502]  But in reality, now that I see all these criminology books and watch all these films and all the surveillance footage stuff that comes out, a lot of people act like that.
[00:36:25.202 --> 00:36:26.543]  They just go, Oh!
[00:36:26.743 --> 00:36:31.124]  And there's this learned helplessness that has been programmed into everyone.
[00:36:32.024 --> 00:36:36.005]  And this broadcast is trying to get people out of that learned helplessness.
[00:36:37.617 --> 00:36:40.079]  Out of the victimology of being a victim.
[00:36:40.879 --> 00:36:45.001]  And people just cherish how they're a victim and how they can't do anything because they're a victim.
[00:36:45.542 --> 00:36:50.705]  And they think it's like a shroud of invincibility or some royal coat that they wear.
[00:36:52.671 --> 00:36:55.293]  And what it's called is spiritual, cultural, and physical slavery.
[00:36:56.073 --> 00:37:08.082]  So there's lots of physical courage and lots of guys that go lift weights and work out and are in great shape and skydive and everything else, but do they have any moral courage to go out and be politically involved and get attacked for things they know are right?
[00:37:09.323 --> 00:37:11.104]  And to get blackballed or to get demonized?
[00:37:11.805 --> 00:37:13.546]  And the answer is no, most of them don't.
[00:37:15.408 --> 00:37:17.069]  Because they're not leaders, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:18.496 --> 00:37:23.759]  The last thing I would want would be Robert Mueller to be hurt physically, and I made that clear before and after.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:39.229]  But I said, politically, he pulls his gun, I'm going to pull mine, and the truth will out, and he will go down in history as a criminal, and I will be vindicated because I'm sick of being called a Russian agent and spit on in the street.
[00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:41.711]  I'll play that video coming up later.
[00:37:43.212 --> 00:37:46.714]  But I'm explaining to folks the thought processes that go on here.
[00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.333]  So people understand why I do the things I do sometimes.
[00:37:53.153 --> 00:38:00.075]  It's because it needed to be on record to the President that Mueller was involved protecting Epstein.
[00:38:00.115 --> 00:38:01.276]  The President didn't know that.
[00:38:01.496 --> 00:38:02.676]  I've done deep research on this.
[00:38:03.456 --> 00:38:05.137]  And I know that the President saw that.
[00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:05.957]  It was a big scandal.
[00:38:06.497 --> 00:38:11.119]  The Justice Department looked at having me indicted for something I didn't say.
[00:38:11.759 --> 00:38:12.219]  It's okay.
[00:38:13.339 --> 00:38:14.419]  That would have been even better.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:22.661]  If they would have indicted me for threatening Mueller when I meant no such thing, I could have then really exposed their pedophile operation.
[00:38:24.142 --> 00:38:26.142]  You see how it works now, don't you?
[00:38:26.983 --> 00:38:39.626]  Because when you don't care about yourself, and you're willing to die to defeat the enemy, then you're truly strong, and no longer a coward like these men that only seek power
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.762]  Over others instead of turning humanity loose.
[00:38:43.982 --> 00:38:49.766]  Oh, they might have physical courage to kill somebody, but they're doing it for their own evil aim.
[00:38:51.508 --> 00:38:52.188]  Selfishness.
[00:38:53.749 --> 00:38:55.851]  And their selfishness has blinded them.
[00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:58.293]  Oh, I said I'd get into the Big Top Story.
[00:39:00.454 --> 00:39:02.976]  I'll do it next segment because there's not time in four and a half minutes.
[00:39:04.857 --> 00:39:06.378]  And it's such a big deal that
[00:39:07.766 --> 00:39:09.246]  It's kind of like a shoe dropping.
[00:39:09.927 --> 00:39:13.768]  We're waiting for the other shoe to drop, and I am not really pleased to even report this.
[00:39:13.908 --> 00:39:18.809]  You know, I have a problem when something's so horrible that I have trouble getting to the point.
[00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:26.491]  But the Chinese troops are massing, and the Chinese government says they're looking to invade Hong Kong.
[00:39:28.071 --> 00:39:36.193]  Which yet Hong Kong and Taiwan that were autonomous, Taiwan more so, after 1949 when Chiang Kai-shek got set up by the leftists at the Ford Foundation,
[00:39:37.452 --> 00:39:47.937]  The Carnegie Endowment, who had their operatives inside the CIA, and they sent Chiang Kai-shek rifles without firing pins when Congress ordered the weapons sent, and it's just total betrayal of the Chinese people.
[00:39:47.957 --> 00:39:49.898]  Imagine if China had been free.
[00:39:50.018 --> 00:39:51.098]  Oh my God, it'd be so wonderful.
[00:39:51.519 --> 00:39:52.219]  So many good people.
[00:39:52.259 --> 00:39:58.322]  But the very worst, bloodthirsty chi-coms were put in control, and now
[00:40:00.194 --> 00:40:22.641]  They have had decades of having most favored trade status by the Clintons, and one-sided deals, and they produce three millionaires a week, and they've got more conventional weapons than we've got, and they've got human clones, cows that produce human milk, robots, just, I mean, they just, it's mad scientist cuckoo land.
[00:40:23.301 --> 00:40:23.762]  Any U.S.
[00:40:23.802 --> 00:40:25.982]  corporation can go there and do whatever you want.
[00:40:26.142 --> 00:40:26.603]  But guess what?
[00:40:26.643 --> 00:40:27.723]  They're all fleeing now.
[00:40:29.104 --> 00:40:31.104]  Because Trump's getting ready to roll them up.
[00:40:31.865 --> 00:40:36.206]  See, in about the last month, it became clear that Trump's getting the upper hand and is winning and taking back America.
[00:40:36.646 --> 00:40:38.686]  And so now the rats are all leaving the sinking ships.
[00:40:40.127 --> 00:40:41.667]  And they're leaving China.
[00:40:42.527 --> 00:40:44.288]  And they're leaving the EU.
[00:40:45.048 --> 00:40:48.929]  And they're all coming here because every day that passes, it's clear that Trump's winning.
[00:40:49.809 --> 00:40:53.070]  And the deep state traders that sold the country out are losing.
[00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:57.711]  And so it is a very, very good position
[00:40:59.164 --> 00:41:00.205]  To be in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:01.365 --> 00:41:06.388]  The problem is, when things start turning this good for us, that's when you better watch your back.
[00:41:07.288 --> 00:41:11.390]  And better not count all your chickens until they're hatched, because we got plenty of problems.
[00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:13.472]  And that's what leads us when we go to break.
[00:41:13.492 --> 00:41:13.892]  We'll come back.
[00:41:15.165 --> 00:41:24.231]  With crackdown coming, China gathers forces on Hong Kong border, and there's two other big crises elsewhere in the world and another one in the South China Sea.
[00:41:24.652 --> 00:41:27.634]  We'll get to all of it coming up, I promise, when we start the next segment.
[00:41:28.014 --> 00:41:28.675]  Please don't forget.
[00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:30.931]  That you know what's going on.
[00:41:30.951 --> 00:41:32.932]  A lot of you knew what was going on before you ever heard this show.
[00:41:33.493 --> 00:41:35.274]  What about your friends, your neighbors, your family?
[00:41:35.594 --> 00:41:40.317]  What about local people that can listen to a local station you're listening to, or a TV station you're watching on?
[00:41:40.818 --> 00:41:41.959]  But I say it's paramount.
[00:41:42.699 --> 00:41:46.682]  It's paramount that you tell people about the broadcast, word of mouth.
[00:41:46.722 --> 00:41:48.083]  Hey, heard of Alex Jones?
[00:41:48.103 --> 00:41:48.943]  Yeah, I used to watch him.
[00:41:49.163 --> 00:41:53.306]  Well, you know he's at Infowars.com, forward slash show, with podcast, audio, video.
[00:41:53.647 --> 00:41:54.367]  It's forbidden.
[00:41:55.048 --> 00:41:55.428]  And hey,
[00:41:57.605 --> 00:41:58.265]  Pass it forward.
[00:41:58.285 --> 00:41:58.686]  Tell folks.
[00:41:58.806 --> 00:42:00.186]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:42:00.506 --> 00:42:02.427]  Newswars.com forward slash show.
[00:42:03.688 --> 00:42:05.329]  That's easier to share at Facebook and Twitter.
[00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:10.951]  They won't censor you as much at Facebook if you put out Newswars.com forward slash show.
[00:42:11.252 --> 00:42:16.594]  It's the Infowars that all their bots and all their minions and all their servants watch for and try to ban.
[00:42:16.974 --> 00:42:22.357]  But Newswars.com forward slash show is there for everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:23.616 --> 00:42:36.002]  And that's how you hear all the other hosts, all the other people in this special 40-hour live Clown World 2 Meet America's Real Enemies 40-hour transmission that ends tomorrow night at 6 p.m.
[00:42:37.502 --> 00:42:41.944]  And I forgot to even add, this is a fundraiser to launch the next phase of the operation.
[00:42:42.224 --> 00:42:43.565]  Some overt, some covert.
[00:42:44.909 --> 00:42:48.652]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.660]  But we can't let them get away with it.
[00:43:18.181 --> 00:43:26.843]  That's why you need to go to Infowarestore.com right now and get yourself a limited edition Betsy Ross flag t-shirt, which is on sale for $17.76.
[00:43:27.863 --> 00:43:32.324]  You can also get the same Don't Treadle Me t-shirt that Chris Pratt was wearing.

[00:43:42.386 --> 00:43:50.549]  They're only printing a limited supply of these t-shirts, so make sure you get yours right now at InfoWarsStore.com before they sell out.
[00:43:51.089 --> 00:43:53.750]  God bless America, and God bless InfoWars.
[00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:58.072]  Flawless victory.
[00:44:05.934 --> 00:44:08.975]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[00:44:09.135 --> 00:44:12.177]  Now, we're bringing you an all-new version to help you reach your energy peak.

[00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:26.262]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[00:44:26.382 --> 00:44:30.104]  Take advantage of the superior form of B12 and head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:44:40.322 --> 00:44:47.027]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements.
[00:44:48.648 --> 00:45:00.158]  And that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[00:45:01.041 --> 00:45:05.283]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[00:45:05.344 --> 00:45:08.866]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[00:45:09.206 --> 00:45:10.827]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[00:45:11.887 --> 00:45:16.070]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:24.014]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[00:45:24.074 --> 00:45:26.636]  But then they say, you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[00:45:26.776 --> 00:45:28.477]  If you don't have vitamin C, you die.
[00:45:28.677 --> 00:45:30.739]  If you don't have iodine in your body, you end up dying.
[00:45:30.759 --> 00:45:32.320]  If you don't have water, you end up dying.
[00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.583]  If you don't have sunshine, if you don't have oxygen, you die.
[00:45:34.663 --> 00:45:36.805]  It may take 10 years without sunshine, but you die.
[00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:48.736]  And if you don't have a whole bunch of minerals and a whole bunch of vitamins and in the organic system where you can upload them, you will end up getting degenerative diseases quicker than you would have and you will die.
[00:45:48.996 --> 00:45:53.840]  And all drugs are, is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:55.001]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[00:45:55.082 --> 00:45:56.863]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature.
[00:45:56.883 --> 00:46:01.127]  I mean, there are some things in Mother Nature you take too much of, you'll have a side effect, but nothing like Big Pharma.
[00:46:01.207 --> 00:46:04.930]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[00:46:05.431 --> 00:46:15.480]  And so, they sit there and they demonize us all day long when we sell things like Ultimate Bone Broth, that's chaga mushroom, incredibly concentrated, high-quality turmeric, and a bunch of other bee pollen.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:24.065]  Mixed with organic concentrated chicken bones that are rendered down where there's no way to quantify it, but this is the strongest bone broth out there.
[00:46:24.105 --> 00:46:25.426]  You can make broth with this.
[00:46:25.586 --> 00:46:29.448]  You can put it in brownies, but I mix it with whey and put some fruit in it, and then it tastes great.
[00:46:29.528 --> 00:46:33.270]  The point is, is it's concentrated, it's uber strong, and it is
[00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:34.010]  Amazing.
[00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:34.870]  Experience it.

[00:46:40.352 --> 00:46:42.193]  And we are unstoppable thanks to you.
[00:46:42.253 --> 00:46:43.834]  Plus, these are products you need.
[00:46:43.954 --> 00:46:48.695]  Get in there today and fund the operation and watch this fight against the globalists continue on.
[00:46:48.996 --> 00:46:53.097]  Because they're doing everything they can to shut us down, and thanks to you, failing!
[00:47:06.383 --> 00:47:09.104]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.509 --> 00:47:30.496]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:58.822]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, I've talked about it, but let's get right into it.
[00:47:59.203 --> 00:48:03.328]  Before we start the second hour and get into all the other news, your phone calls and guest, Robert Barnes in studio.
[00:48:04.858 --> 00:48:06.720]  These stories are both on Infowars.com.
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:07.521]  Excellent reports.
[00:48:07.741 --> 00:48:11.124]  Michael Snyder does a great job at Economic Collapse Blog laying it out.
[00:48:11.745 --> 00:48:15.828]  We were talking about this again last week and a few days ago, the specifics, but now it's mainstream news.
[00:48:16.569 --> 00:48:20.553]  Australia, top news, ABC News, this is happening.
[00:48:21.694 --> 00:48:22.635]  Crackdown coming.
[00:48:22.875 --> 00:48:25.638]  China gathers forces on Hong Kong border.
[00:48:26.972 --> 00:48:47.177]  Amid unrest, massive anti-Beijing protests which have gripped Hong Kong over the past month have become increasingly violent as both an overwhelmed local police force, pro-Beijing, and counter-protesters have hit back with force and are threatening to escalate on a larger geopolitical scale after the White House weighed in this week.
[00:48:49.477 --> 00:48:55.439]  Now again, not since Ronald Reagan have we had a president that didn't abandon Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[00:48:57.048 --> 00:49:06.916]  And so China is saying it's the hidden hand of the United States that is there supporting Hong Kong not going under Communist China's total control.
[00:49:08.637 --> 00:49:14.442]  Well, yes, it's emboldening the folks that live in Hong Kong and in Taiwan that finally the U.S.
[00:49:14.482 --> 00:49:15.122]  is standing up for them.
[00:49:15.342 --> 00:49:22.048]  We should never have sold them out and given the keys to the whole planet and the rare earth minerals and industry to the shycomps.
[00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:27.152]  So yes, you better believe this is this is Trump, but not ordering people to do this.
[00:49:27.212 --> 00:49:27.993]  They've been waiting.
[00:49:29.353 --> 00:49:32.135]  You know, like I said, the Chinese are ready for a fight anytime, folks.
[00:49:32.195 --> 00:49:34.636]  And these are the real Chinese that are not the communist.
[00:49:35.136 --> 00:49:40.499]  And they are and they're the brain trust that was in China that ran to Hong Kong and ran to Taiwan.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:47.443]  And they're again trying to pass a law there because, you know, they actually have representative government because the British put that in.
[00:49:47.823 --> 00:49:50.885]  The Chinese want that gone to arrest and take people to
[00:49:52.199 --> 00:49:56.380]  The mainland, to Beijing, and to Peking, and to other areas.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:01.162]  And so, these protesters aren't going around hitting people in the head who are for free speech.
[00:50:01.182 --> 00:50:04.823]  They're not going around and, you know, pissing on themselves like leftists.
[00:50:04.863 --> 00:50:10.305]  They're going into government buildings, they're taking over, and when the cops attack them, they're beating the hell out of them.
[00:50:10.965 --> 00:50:13.726]  And when the cops fire guns at them, they take the guns away and beat them over the head.
[00:50:14.386 --> 00:50:16.307]  So, this is called a real revolution.
[00:50:18.695 --> 00:50:22.780]  And this is going to end up being way bigger than Tiananmen Square.
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.921]  In fact, you heard it here first.
[00:50:24.862 --> 00:50:25.923]  I'm not going to even hedge bets.
[00:50:27.285 --> 00:50:30.668]  I think within the next week, you're going to see a Tiananmen Square-level event.
[00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.712]  Only if the Chinese government backs down.
[00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:39.959]  And their dictator, given more power than Mao Zedong, Xi, has not been showing any signs of that.
[00:50:42.611 --> 00:50:47.173]  So, this is going to get extremely violent, extremely quickly.
[00:50:47.193 --> 00:50:58.977]  Because I'm telling you folks, studying warfare, and the Asian brain, and everybody can turn it loose and kill people, but once the Asians start getting into a fight, it gets real bloody, real quick, and both sides don't give up.
[00:50:59.657 --> 00:51:02.678]  So this is gonna get really, really, really nasty, fast.
[00:51:03.118 --> 00:51:04.078]  Crackdown coming.
[00:51:04.559 --> 00:51:08.200]  China gathers forces on Hong Kong border amid unrest.
[00:51:09.428 --> 00:51:19.033]  With China fast losing patience, there are new reports of significant build-up of Chinese security forces on Hong Kong's border, as Bloomberg reports.
[00:51:19.473 --> 00:51:24.035]  And again, don't think that the folks in Hong Kong don't have weapons either they haven't pulled out yet.
[00:51:25.276 --> 00:51:26.216]  This is going to get serious.
[00:51:26.717 --> 00:51:29.418]  This isn't going to be like Tiananmen Square where nobody's got weapons.
[00:51:30.578 --> 00:51:33.480]  And by the way, you can take all the weapons you want all day with just a knife or a hammer.
[00:51:34.582 --> 00:51:37.405]  You know, if you're not Antifa swinging the hammer, you can actually get something done.
[00:51:37.425 --> 00:51:41.468]  I mean, I could kill ten people in about two minutes with a hammer in a fight.
[00:51:42.389 --> 00:51:43.810]  Thank God Antifa didn't know how to use one.
[00:51:43.830 --> 00:51:45.512]  You see those videos, they're hitting people with those hammers.
[00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:59.885]  It says, from nearly the start of the protest, which began over a proposed extradition bill, which would see Hong Kong citizens under legal accusation potentially extradited to the mainland,
[00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:11.955]  Interpreted as major Chinese overreach inside historically semi-autonomous Hong Kong, officials in Beijing have suggested an external plot afoot by the United States.
[00:52:12.816 --> 00:52:13.456]  But here's the thing.
[00:52:14.357 --> 00:52:18.939]  They never came in and took over all of Hong Kong because the Hong Kong population was going to fight.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:24.802]  Now, gosh, hard to believe that's almost 70 years ago.
[00:52:25.023 --> 00:52:24.802]  1949.
[00:52:27.084 --> 00:52:27.504]  Unbelievable.
[00:52:28.204 --> 00:52:29.205]  And it's the same reason.
[00:52:30.486 --> 00:52:34.589]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, what level of tyranny will the tyrants push?
[00:52:36.231 --> 00:52:38.232]  And he said, the level you will put up with.
[00:52:39.873 --> 00:52:40.494]  Well, here's the difference.
[00:52:40.514 --> 00:52:45.158]  Hong Kong's military is not going to resist China.
[00:52:46.298 --> 00:52:47.279]  Taiwan's is.
[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:51.442]  And they've got high-tech service-to-air missiles.
[00:52:52.844 --> 00:52:53.224]  They've got
[00:52:55.942 --> 00:52:58.483]  Ship to ship, ground to ship, air to ship.
[00:52:59.284 --> 00:53:05.847]  And the Chinese is also, the military is massing, obviously, a military to invade Taiwan.
[00:53:06.167 --> 00:53:08.308]  And they've said just a week ago they may invade Taiwan.
[00:53:09.248 --> 00:53:13.210]  And believe me, folks, if the Chinese start saying we're looking to invade, they're not just saying that.
[00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:15.871]  They're building all those islands over the South China Sea.
[00:53:16.151 --> 00:53:23.795]  They're saying territorial waters of Japan, territorial waters way south of Vietnam and of the Philippines are theirs.
[00:53:25.043 --> 00:53:28.944]  This is just like the Japanese pulled in 1941.
[00:53:29.805 --> 00:53:34.706]  They're about to pull the same thing, but they've got nuclear weapons this time, and it's the Chi-Coms.
[00:53:37.067 --> 00:53:38.467]  So that's why the left's flipping out.
[00:53:38.727 --> 00:53:40.648]  That's why Netflix is trying to cause a race war.
[00:53:40.668 --> 00:53:41.889]  It's why Hollywood's so out of control.
[00:53:42.169 --> 00:53:44.789]  Because the Chi-Coms own Hollywood.
[00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:51.732]  And they are flooding billions of dollars a week into unrest.
[00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:58.166]  So you wonder why you're seeing all this stuff go on, because the Chi-Coms are exerting force on America.
[00:53:58.947 --> 00:54:07.894]  They've rolled up over 50 Confucian Institutes run by the Chinese Intelligence Network inside the U.S., including one at the University of Texas.
[00:54:10.616 --> 00:54:20.684]  And again, we were watching the group, and the only reason the state police and others via the feds came here and said, hey, you can go watch them if you want, but we're there, but please don't alert them.
[00:54:21.647 --> 00:54:24.168]  Because we're there watching them.
[00:54:24.188 --> 00:54:25.288]  Please don't step on our toes.
[00:54:26.108 --> 00:54:27.408]  I said, fine, you just handle it then.
[00:54:27.448 --> 00:54:28.168]  I'm glad you're watching.
[00:54:28.448 --> 00:54:28.848]  And boom.
[00:54:28.928 --> 00:54:31.849]  A year later, they shut that whole thing down at UT.
[00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:37.490]  Chai comms were pumping 50 million a quarter into UT.
[00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:40.291]  The Chinese intelligence.
[00:54:41.451 --> 00:54:43.591]  And that's down the street from me, man!
[00:54:43.971 --> 00:54:45.572]  UT has nuclear reactors.
[00:54:46.132 --> 00:54:46.812]  It has everything.
[00:54:47.812 --> 00:54:49.993]  Weapons, drug labs.
[00:54:50.033 --> 00:54:51.253]  I mean, it's the DARPA.
[00:54:52.403 --> 00:54:54.264]  And we let the CHICOMS into DARPA.
[00:54:55.686 --> 00:54:57.787]  There's underground bases under Austin.
[00:54:58.308 --> 00:55:00.389]  Used to be the SAC command headquarters was here at Bergstrom.
[00:55:00.569 --> 00:55:02.151]  They've got railways out to Fort Hood.
[00:55:03.832 --> 00:55:08.896]  We've let the CHICOMS into everything, and Trump is removing them.
[00:55:13.419 --> 00:55:14.060]  And they're pissed.
[00:55:15.361 --> 00:55:20.625]  And so, they're now saying that
[00:55:22.628 --> 00:55:26.550]  They are going to invade these countries as a way to checkmate Trump.
[00:55:26.971 --> 00:55:27.451]  Good luck!
[00:55:27.511 --> 00:55:35.136]  But the point is, this could turn into a regional war very easily, probably will, and it could turn into a catastrophe of biblical proportions.
[00:55:35.596 --> 00:55:37.677]  By the way, I see you guys are pulling up other Confucius Institutes.
[00:55:37.697 --> 00:55:40.119]  Just type in, UT cancels
[00:55:42.099 --> 00:55:45.622]  Confucius Institutes because of Chinese intelligence.
[00:55:45.662 --> 00:55:47.023]  That was last year.
[00:55:47.563 --> 00:55:52.426]  And over 50 have been shut down across the United States because Chinese intelligence was caught.
[00:55:52.446 --> 00:55:55.028]  Because, you know, the crew just searches whatever I talk about.
[00:55:55.429 --> 00:55:57.150]  And sometimes they get it right, sometimes they get it wrong.
[00:55:57.350 --> 00:55:59.031]  Because, I mean, how could they always get it right?
[00:55:59.932 --> 00:56:01.393]  They were pulling up other Confucius Institutes.
[00:56:01.413 --> 00:56:03.174]  But it's well known this is going on.
[00:56:04.535 --> 00:56:05.476]  And so this is a big deal.
[00:56:06.514 --> 00:56:19.562]  And when we come back, I'll get into the other two areas that could start giant wars in the Middle East and in Africa and another area that's happening there in Asia as well.
[00:56:19.582 --> 00:56:20.942]  But this is a big, big deal.
[00:56:22.283 --> 00:56:24.044]  Separately, let me do a proper plug.
[00:56:24.064 --> 00:56:25.305]  We're in the middle of a fundraiser.
[00:56:25.385 --> 00:56:26.926]  If we sell a million dollars of product,
[00:56:27.931 --> 00:56:29.192]  Then we'll only make like $150,000.
[00:56:29.252 --> 00:56:30.892]  We sell a million.
[00:56:30.932 --> 00:56:32.133]  We'll probably make about $300,000.
[00:56:32.553 --> 00:56:43.998]  I got up at 530 this morning and I went and looked at Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[00:56:58.322 --> 00:56:59.163]  And he said, let me check.
[00:56:59.183 --> 00:57:05.567]  Well, an hour later they go, oh, when they batched the orders that came in on the shopping cart, it triple batched that batch.
[00:57:05.888 --> 00:57:08.269]  So yeah, that removed $200,000 from it.
[00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:10.071]  So it's at $389,000.
[00:57:11.011 --> 00:57:17.716]  And again, it's just a system that adds the donations that get entered in and the shopping cart stuff and updates every 30 minutes, I'm told.
[00:57:18.117 --> 00:57:19.618]  So it's not exact, but it's around $389,000.
[00:57:19.658 --> 00:57:20.178]  And that's, you know,
[00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:25.501]  Triple what we normally bring in in the last few days.
[00:57:25.921 --> 00:57:26.641]  And so that's good.
[00:57:27.141 --> 00:57:30.683]  But when we're selling this stuff, some of it is very close to no profit.
[00:57:31.883 --> 00:57:33.203]  The supplements, all of it.
[00:57:33.443 --> 00:57:34.804]  So it takes a lot of sales to do it.
[00:57:35.184 --> 00:57:36.744]  And I'm just going to keep pushing.
[00:57:37.125 --> 00:57:41.426]  And I hope by tomorrow we bring a million dollars gross sales, added donations.
[00:57:41.446 --> 00:57:43.186]  And we're getting a lot of gross sales, not a lot of donations.
[00:57:43.227 --> 00:57:44.527]  But it's easy to do that as well.
[00:57:44.587 --> 00:57:46.668]  Donations are better because we get 95% of the money.
[00:57:47.068 --> 00:57:48.628]  And that's really needed for the next project.
[00:57:48.648 --> 00:57:49.228]  So check it out.
[00:57:49.508 --> 00:57:50.529]  Infowarestore.com.
[00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.849]  Thank you.
[00:57:52.312 --> 00:57:53.053]  George R. Wells.
[00:58:25.097 --> 00:58:49.765]  What in the world's going on here?
[00:58:53.499 --> 00:58:58.801]  George Orwell said that in a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:58:59.442 --> 00:59:01.883]  And so, used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag.
[00:59:02.423 --> 00:59:06.165]  Because we still loved our country, and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it.
[00:59:06.645 --> 00:59:09.346]  But now, they're trying to take it out of schools.
[00:59:09.607 --> 00:59:11.267]  They're taking it down off of government buildings.
[00:59:11.828 --> 00:59:16.670]  Weird white leftists that want to virtue-signal are pulling down American flags and running up Mexican flags.
[00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:19.672]  This is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing.
[00:59:20.232 --> 00:59:35.662]  So now it is a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag, and particularly when it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, America's back, Infowars.com.
[00:59:36.343 --> 00:59:46.930]  So whatever you do, take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies' face, all over, not just the U.S., but worldwide, because more than ever, the American flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism.
[00:59:55.841 --> 01:00:00.206]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:09.717 --> 01:00:11.759]  Devastating globalist lies.
[01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:15.963]  Exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[01:00:16.684 --> 01:00:19.406]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption.
[01:00:19.847 --> 01:00:23.650]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas.
[01:00:24.211 --> 01:00:25.933]  Transmitting worldwide.
[01:00:26.473 --> 01:00:27.794]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.615 --> 01:00:32.679]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:42.443 --> 01:00:43.743]  We got it.
[01:00:44.043 --> 01:00:45.464]  America's got it.
[01:00:45.604 --> 01:00:46.504]  We got it.
[01:00:46.584 --> 01:00:52.005]  America's got it, and the whole world wants it.
[01:01:05.123 --> 01:01:07.404]  Oh, we've got evil, but we've also got good.
[01:01:07.444 --> 01:01:19.568]  We've got the heights, we've got the lows, we've got the renaissance, the real awakening, the real enlightenment that the Illuminati of Adam Weishaupt tried to hijack with communism, with Jacobinism, with the left-hand path.
[01:01:20.989 --> 01:01:23.189]  No, we don't want the left hand to rise above here.
[01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:25.670]  It'll never rise above.
[01:01:26.631 --> 01:01:29.192]  Left hand rise above!
[01:01:29.632 --> 01:01:30.252]  Not gonna happen.
[01:01:33.715 --> 01:01:36.896]  You can try to cheat your way to heaven, but all you'll do is go straight to hell.
[01:01:38.777 --> 01:01:44.339]  So we just witnessed three major developments that could easily lead to global war, and I agree with this analysis.
[01:01:45.059 --> 01:01:50.861]  And it just goes through the situation with Israel's already in a shooting war with Iran, in Syria, and in other areas.
[01:01:51.702 --> 01:01:54.583]  You've got the Hong Kong situation, you've got the Taiwan situation.
[01:01:57.202 --> 01:01:58.743]  And so much more that's unfolding.
[01:01:59.143 --> 01:02:04.105]  And then meanwhile, ISIS warns of terror strikes in San Francisco, New York, and London.
[01:02:06.685 --> 01:02:11.867]  Now, Saudi Arabia had been financing that as part of the Arab Spring under Obama's authorization.
[01:02:13.488 --> 01:02:15.789]  Trump said, that's over or we're going to overthrow you.
[01:02:16.229 --> 01:02:20.651]  The Saudis said, hey, we were told to do this, set up by the British, you know, a hundred years ago.
[01:02:20.691 --> 01:02:21.511]  We've been doing this the whole time.
[01:02:22.659 --> 01:02:23.560]  Yes, sir, boss.
[01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:25.581]  When you say jump, we say how high.
[01:02:25.681 --> 01:02:26.282]  Well, that's good.
[01:02:26.302 --> 01:02:28.643]  Because I don't want to blow up Saudi Arabia.
[01:02:28.764 --> 01:02:29.984]  I don't want to be at war with the Muslims.
[01:02:31.926 --> 01:02:33.147]  Yeah, radical Islam's real.
[01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:33.967]  It's out of control.
[01:02:34.027 --> 01:02:36.029]  But globalists are there financing it.
[01:02:36.769 --> 01:02:37.190]  Funding it.
[01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:41.533]  You know, I've had prominent Muslims on air, off air, tell me, why don't you leave us alone?
[01:02:41.553 --> 01:02:42.594]  You know, most of us don't want this.
[01:02:42.614 --> 01:02:44.775]  You know, the CIA and others are in there fomenting this.
[01:02:45.156 --> 01:02:45.916]  I'm like, yeah, I get it.
[01:02:47.457 --> 01:02:48.058]  But does it matter?
[01:02:49.213 --> 01:02:52.335]  Even if something's a wind-up toy, it's still attacking me.
[01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:59.458]  So I've got to deal with the globalist threat, and I've got to deal with the stuff it's releasing and pushing and turning loose.
[01:02:59.498 --> 01:03:06.502]  And I can't, as a culture, have the left sit there and tell me that I can't criticize radical Islam, and then let it run my life.
[01:03:07.843 --> 01:03:17.888]  Then we have all the videos I didn't even get to this week of gay pride parades with the Muslims showing up in England and the U.S., screaming at them, saying, you're an abomination, go to hell, what you're doing is horrible, shame on you.
[01:03:20.049 --> 01:03:27.471]  And I'm sitting there watching the gay pride parades that have turned into pedophile parades with a bunch of half-naked little kids, and I'm like, lesser of two evils as the Muslims.
[01:03:27.491 --> 01:03:33.453]  You know, at least they're not wanting to parade kids around to have sex with them.
[01:03:34.313 --> 01:03:36.333]  And do you think the average person that's gay is into that?
[01:03:36.553 --> 01:03:36.793]  No.
[01:03:37.574 --> 01:03:42.475]  But through this culture of leftist acceptance, pedophilia is now being accepted.
[01:03:43.495 --> 01:03:45.856]  And it is disgusting.
[01:03:47.796 --> 01:03:49.657]  I mean, I don't even want to say the things I've seen on video.
[01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:53.892]  That is mainline news, but I won't even show on this show.
[01:03:55.893 --> 01:04:00.155]  Because I know some children could be watching, but parents can't hide this from their children.
[01:04:00.455 --> 01:04:03.397]  There's so much evil out there now, that you just gotta tell them.
[01:04:03.777 --> 01:04:05.138]  Sheltering them is not the way to go.
[01:04:05.638 --> 01:04:07.719]  You need to explain what it is, and how it works.
[01:04:07.759 --> 01:04:08.940]  By the way, I haven't even gotten to that yet.
[01:04:09.881 --> 01:04:10.461]  That's coming up.
[01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:15.484]  In Australia, they're putting out public service announcements saying, don't let grandma kiss you on the cheek.
[01:04:15.604 --> 01:04:16.504]  That's pedophilia.
[01:04:17.025 --> 01:04:19.026]  But, pedophilia's okay.
[01:04:20.598 --> 01:04:21.319]  See how that works?
[01:04:21.459 --> 01:04:23.560]  Family is bad.
[01:04:24.181 --> 01:04:25.261]  Your mom kissing you.
[01:04:25.702 --> 01:04:27.383]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[01:04:27.403 --> 01:04:29.324]  My grandmothers all kiss me on the lips.
[01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.086]  And it's because they wanted to eat me up.
[01:04:31.126 --> 01:04:31.906]  They love me so much.
[01:04:32.847 --> 01:04:33.127]  Okay?
[01:04:34.048 --> 01:04:38.071]  And, you know, again, they take normal, healthy, good things.
[01:04:39.232 --> 01:04:42.434]  Like, until I was about, you know, 10 years old, my mother kissed me on the lips.
[01:04:42.474 --> 01:04:43.375]  After that, she stopped doing it.
[01:04:43.415 --> 01:04:44.916]  But that was pure affection.
[01:04:46.186 --> 01:04:58.371]  It's incredible, but they turn what's wholesome and good into sickness, but then tell you pedophilia is good with a big pot-bellied fat man, you know, with your kid riding horsey at the, uh, at the public school event or the library event.
[01:04:58.692 --> 01:04:59.552]  Total evil!
[01:04:59.772 --> 01:05:01.153]  They're trying to extinct the family.
[01:05:01.473 --> 01:05:02.033]  Stay with us.
[01:05:03.534 --> 01:05:04.354]  It's happening now.
[01:05:05.094 --> 01:05:05.455]  Right now.
[01:05:06.215 --> 01:05:12.738]  All over the world, humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist, globalist, world government, Mark of the Beast agenda.
[01:05:14.104 --> 01:05:18.507]  And the forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the spear, InfoWars, more than ever.
[01:05:19.268 --> 01:05:28.415]  Well, we're doing a special 40-hour broadcast to get new projects we've developed up and into orbit, and to take action at the next level.
[01:05:29.096 --> 01:05:35.461]  The globalists know we've already devastated them, and they hope that you don't take action, because when you support InfoWars, you change the world.
[01:05:36.261 --> 01:05:40.683]  Find coverage at clownworld.us and at infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:05:40.703 --> 01:05:51.166]  But whatever you do, join us during this special 40-hour broadcast that's happening right now and spread the word because that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech censors.
[01:05:51.506 --> 01:05:55.948]  Again, infowars.com forward slash show or clownworld.us.
[01:05:56.248 --> 01:05:56.868]  Please take action.
[01:06:05.202 --> 01:06:15.165]  Big Brother.
[01:06:15.625 --> 01:06:16.865]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:17.385 --> 01:06:18.526]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:19.306 --> 01:06:20.766]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:21.006 --> 01:06:22.147]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:22.667 --> 01:06:27.348]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:27.708 --> 01:06:29.008]  It's the eyes, Chico.
[01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:29.969]  The eyes.
[01:06:30.149 --> 01:06:30.929]  They never lie.
[01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:47.958]  You know, the top Nazi, Werner Von Braun, wrote a 1959 book, or 1949 book, I'm going for memory here, called Project Mars, where the Elons are the aliens who end up taking over the Earth.
[01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:51.580]  Beware the Elon and the Elon invasion.
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.181]  Dr. Werner Von Braun.
[01:06:53.341 --> 01:06:54.002]  Wonder what he knew.
[01:06:54.162 --> 01:07:00.906]  When I watched his promo about this with executives from his company, they all look like they're on hardcore drugs.
[01:07:00.966 --> 01:07:03.808]  I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up, like,
[01:07:05.464 --> 01:07:06.786]  I mean, they look nuts.
[01:07:07.146 --> 01:07:08.308]  You know when somebody's on drugs.
[01:07:08.328 --> 01:07:11.993]  You know, they admit Silicon Valley is into hardcore speed and elusive agents.
[01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:15.597]  They're taking IV drips at work of DMT.
[01:07:15.758 --> 01:07:20.784]  They're taking LSD microdoses and psilocybin mushrooms and peyote every day!
[01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:22.426]  Who in the hell...
[01:07:23.007 --> 01:07:24.247]  Would want to join with these people.
[01:07:24.367 --> 01:07:26.828]  I've seen people take like three hits of acid, their eyes aren't that big.
[01:07:26.868 --> 01:07:27.748]  What the hell are they on?
[01:07:27.888 --> 01:07:42.551]  And one of the crew members said maybe they've already got this whole Neuralink virus hooks in their brain because as PKD pointed out, Philip K. Dick back in the 70s, the cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want, just plug in, but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days.
[01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:46.091]  You just die because you just plug all this in and it's the Matrix.
[01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:48.532]  And now the Matrix is here and you look at Tim Cook.
[01:07:48.752 --> 01:07:51.713]  Or Elon Musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage.
[01:07:51.873 --> 01:07:53.274]  They'll be under white lights.
[01:07:53.474 --> 01:07:55.955]  Their pupils are 90% open.
[01:07:56.135 --> 01:07:58.876]  Zuckerberg, all of them, these people either have brain chips.
[01:07:59.096 --> 01:07:59.556]  That's it.
[01:07:59.936 --> 01:08:02.017]  These guys are wireheads.
[01:08:02.237 --> 01:08:03.718]  Something's going on.
[01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:08.140]  I'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils are very little.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.120]  Now zoom in if you can.
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.061]  My pupils are tiny because I'm not on drugs.
[01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:13.022]  I've had two cups of coffee today.
[01:08:13.202 --> 01:08:14.884]  So here, let me show you my pupils, okay?
[01:08:15.104 --> 01:08:16.306]  My pupils are little.
[01:08:16.386 --> 01:08:17.507]  They're supposed to close!
[01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:20.610]  That's what happens under the sun or under bright lights, but not these guys.
[01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:26.235]  These are drug addicts, and they want the hit of wires in their brains, and all of them got those giant pupils.
[01:08:27.376 --> 01:08:29.578]  Because they've been there, and they ain't coming back.
[01:08:41.111 --> 01:08:49.637]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:08:49.737 --> 01:09:01.346]  Alright, a guy that's become a good friend of mine, really smart, funny fella, and one of our, you know, top hosts here now, co-hosting with us, and our Chief Legal Strategist, Robert Barnes, joins us.
[01:09:02.731 --> 01:09:06.093]  By the way, he didn't get his Covington Kid lawsuit thrown out this week.
[01:09:06.253 --> 01:09:08.154]  That was the other fellow that filed lawsuits.
[01:09:08.174 --> 01:09:09.555]  I've gotten a bunch of calls about that.
[01:09:09.575 --> 01:09:12.997]  You haven't filed your suits yet because you've been strategically planning them.
[01:09:13.397 --> 01:09:16.078]  We're both a couple months behind right now, but those suits are very, very close.
[01:09:16.479 --> 01:09:17.579]  Our suits are very, very close.
[01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:21.201]  We'll give our friends and our enemies an update in the last segment of this hour.
[01:09:21.601 --> 01:09:23.603]  So remind me to do that coming up.
[01:09:23.623 --> 01:09:24.763]  But it's an important footnote.
[01:09:25.804 --> 01:09:31.067]  But the first thing I want to hit with you is something that I normally don't want to talk about.
[01:09:31.826 --> 01:09:33.668]  But now it's come to a head, so we should.
[01:09:34.248 --> 01:09:39.414]  The Robert Mueller hearings last week, it all coming to a head.
[01:09:39.434 --> 01:09:47.321]  Trump saying there's going to be criminal investigations, and there are criminal investigations, of the leakers and the illegal spying and the perjury to Congress.
[01:09:48.122 --> 01:09:54.629]  And Trump coming out and saying it's the end of a witch hunt after a judge appointed by Clinton dismisses DNC lawsuit out of New York.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:02.530]  The Southern District of New York completely dismissed as saying that it was entirely divorced from the facts.
[01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:05.313]  Yet another total and complete fraud.
[01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.535]  Entirely divorced.
[01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:09.679]  Then I've got a whole stack of articles I never really mentioned last week.
[01:10:10.694 --> 01:10:15.676]  The Washington Post, all of them coming out and saying, OK, we apologize.
[01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:18.057]  It's not bad that we investigated, but we were wrong.
[01:10:18.157 --> 01:10:18.697]  You're innocent.
[01:10:19.057 --> 01:10:20.398]  So they're trying to have their take.
[01:10:21.038 --> 01:10:21.718]  I need it, too.
[01:10:22.099 --> 01:10:24.340]  But what does the Mueller report mean for Trump 2020?
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:28.001]  And it just goes on to say, OK, he didn't do it.
[01:10:28.981 --> 01:10:29.522]  We were wrong.
[01:10:30.542 --> 01:10:32.903]  New York Times owes Americans a big fat apology.
[01:10:32.963 --> 01:10:33.823]  That's the New York Post.
[01:10:33.883 --> 01:10:35.264]  Apologies to President Trump.
[01:10:35.344 --> 01:10:35.704]  The Hill.
[01:10:38.686 --> 01:10:40.207]  Like a dog going back to its vomit.
[01:10:40.347 --> 01:10:41.827]  I don't think they can help it.
[01:10:41.867 --> 01:10:44.589]  The Democratic leadership's still doubling, tripling, quadrupling down.
[01:10:45.629 --> 01:10:52.992]  The media had every right to pursue Russia, Trump, but Washington Post, again, goes on to say that they're wrong.
[01:10:53.352 --> 01:10:55.053]  This to me is a pretty big deal.
[01:10:55.113 --> 01:10:56.554]  What do you make of this, Robert Barnes?
[01:10:56.774 --> 01:10:59.855]  So the case in New York, this was a liberal jurisdiction.
[01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:03.257]  The case was before a liberal judge in the Southern District of New York.
[01:11:03.757 --> 01:11:06.159]  Who said there's something called the Twombly Standard.
[01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:08.361]  T-U-W-O-M-B-L-Y.
[01:11:08.441 --> 01:11:09.522]  United States v. Twombly.
[01:11:09.882 --> 01:11:19.391]  And what the Twombly Standard stands for, and there's another one called Iqbal, are two cases that say that just because you allege facts in a complaint does not mean a court has to take them seriously.
[01:11:19.731 --> 01:11:21.713]  So the court has to look at plausible facts.
[01:11:22.133 --> 01:11:39.257]  So what was significant was here you have a liberal judge in a liberal jurisdiction saying that there are, quote, no plausible facts that supported any allegation of collusion against the president and his allies, of conspiracy against the president and his allies, or of any crime against the president and his allies.
[01:11:39.557 --> 01:11:42.737]  He said their complaint was so weak that nobody could look at the facts.
[01:11:42.757 --> 01:11:44.158]  He said divorce from reality.
[01:11:44.218 --> 01:11:48.439]  Divorce from reality and his exact quote was no plausible facts, period.
[01:11:49.059 --> 01:11:49.999]  And that's a liberal judge
[01:11:50.919 --> 01:11:52.759]  In a liberal jurisdiction declaring that.
[01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.480]  So at this point it is beyond doubt, beyond question.
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.220]  I mean, last night they didn't even ask a single question about Mueller.
[01:11:58.561 --> 01:11:59.581]  Because it's so dead.
[01:11:59.681 --> 01:12:00.781]  Because it's so mute.
[01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:01.941]  Because it's so irrelevant.
[01:12:01.961 --> 01:12:03.121]  Because it's so implausible.
[01:12:03.442 --> 01:12:14.144]  That when you have liberal judges in liberal jurisdictions saying this case is crap, that this argument is crap, that there was no collusion, no crime, no conspiracy, at this point that's where you're starting to see apologies.
[01:12:14.444 --> 01:12:18.044]  Yet the Democrats in Congress, and in the House in particular, continue to double down.
[01:12:18.104 --> 01:12:20.305]  An increasing number calling for impeachment.
[01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:23.687]  They're now saying members of Congress are Russian agents.
[01:12:23.988 --> 01:12:24.488]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:30.613]  They're accusing Senator McConnell, who's maybe been a corporate agent for a long time, but not really been a Russian government agent by any imagination.
[01:12:30.633 --> 01:12:32.895]  Oh, he's a total globalist agent of anything.
[01:12:32.935 --> 01:12:33.435]  He's a toad.
[01:12:34.096 --> 01:12:35.377]  By any imagination, he's a toad.
[01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:39.741]  But he's by no definition, or by anyone's imagination, Putin's toad.
[01:12:40.361 --> 01:12:46.026]  So at this point, the question is, to what degree do they continue to live in a denial land?
[01:12:46.286 --> 01:12:47.247]  And it was a fascinating day.
[01:12:47.267 --> 01:12:58.356]  You have a day in which there are headlines about New York Fire Commissioners calling for 9-11 investigations because there was clear use of explosives by what happened to the health condition of the fire workers that they've now been able to look at over a 15-year time period.
[01:12:58.376 --> 01:13:02.159]  What's happening is there's a complete loss of confidence in the system now.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:03.120]  Exactly.
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:05.783]  And even GQ magazine came out with a big article.
[01:13:06.578 --> 01:13:11.340]  I'm gonna bring my name into it and said, well, there has been so much lying, that's why this is the age of Alex Jones.
[01:13:11.781 --> 01:13:18.644]  No, it's the age of you being caught being liars, and now everyone that was afraid to speak out about what they saw, they told the police to get back.
[01:13:18.844 --> 01:13:19.705]  They had a countdown.
[01:13:19.805 --> 01:13:21.666]  FEMA had a countdown on Building 7.
[01:13:22.246 --> 01:13:22.586]  Oh, exactly.
[01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:24.207]  I mean, it's even, it was on local news.
[01:13:24.627 --> 01:13:27.209]  I talked to the cops that were there and heard the countdown.
[01:13:27.549 --> 01:13:29.710]  And then the media went, Jones says cops blew it up.
[01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:33.412]  No, I interviewed the cops that heard the damn countdown.
[01:13:33.712 --> 01:13:38.576]  It's probably not a coincidence that this is all happening while President Trump is President Trump.
[01:13:38.897 --> 01:13:47.985]  So you're looking at, I mean, President Trump was the one who said live at the time, when the buildings came down, that this was evidence of a controlled demolition.
[01:13:48.045 --> 01:13:50.087]  And this was someone in the building trades who knew about it.
[01:13:50.467 --> 01:14:01.139]  And on top of that, Japan, for example, announced that they're going to start doing human-hybrid experimentation because they're no longer limiting themselves legally and their doctors from doing so.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:05.184]  And that's because China's been doing it forever, and so they're racing ahead.
[01:14:05.384 --> 01:14:05.784]  Oh, exactly.
[01:14:05.804 --> 01:14:18.992]  Well, you see, like, for example, there's a major publication that has started to become more substantial called the Epoch Times, and the reason is because they represent a sort of a religious tradition that has been targeted for donor experimentation in China.
[01:14:19.113 --> 01:14:19.953]  That's the Palangong.
[01:14:20.113 --> 01:14:20.533]  Exactly.
[01:14:20.633 --> 01:14:22.455]  And the whole Epoch Times and everything about it.
[01:14:22.755 --> 01:14:24.556]  So the newspaper's called the Epoch Times.
[01:14:24.596 --> 01:14:30.980]  They're big fans of mine, and I'm just saying, I mean, for years I go to the Chinese food restaurant owned by those folks, and they're always trying to give me free food and just love us.
[01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:37.743]  Oh, I mean they created, what's fascinating is they created a spiritual movement, a real spiritual movement, unlike sort of meditation with Mary Ann.
[01:14:38.123 --> 01:14:43.106]  A real spiritual movement that was so strong the government was so scared of it in China that it felt the need to suppress it.
[01:14:43.126 --> 01:14:44.867]  Because it's totally decentralized and it's all about...
[01:14:45.885 --> 01:14:46.726]  Life and action.
[01:14:47.166 --> 01:14:59.336]  It's a pro-human, pro-individual movement that used its spiritual connection of allowing people to connect to nature in an organic and authentic way that challenged systemic and institutional power that would have misused and abused human life.
[01:14:59.376 --> 01:15:03.680]  Because they want us out of nature, that's the satanic system, out of nature inside of a bubble.
[01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:04.260]  Exactly.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:13.788]  They're the sort of digital reality that the Democrats are living in in the debates, such that they think going harder to the left is the appropriate path, which is what both Warren and Bernie Sanders were doing last night.
[01:15:14.088 --> 01:15:16.590]  They're trying to shorten the climate change.
[01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:18.292]  It was 12 years we're going to all die.
[01:15:18.332 --> 01:15:19.092]  Now it's 10 years.
[01:15:20.013 --> 01:15:21.134]  That clip's coming up too.
[01:15:21.354 --> 01:15:21.654]  Exactly.
[01:15:21.714 --> 01:15:23.656]  By the time of the election, it's going to be two years.
[01:15:23.816 --> 01:15:27.399]  The planet will blow up like Krypton if you don't elect Joe Biden.
[01:15:27.619 --> 01:15:27.999]  Exactly.
[01:15:28.019 --> 01:15:34.001]  On Inauguration Day, the whole country and the whole world will be over unless a Democrat's in the White House.
[01:15:34.021 --> 01:15:34.702]  That will be the pitch.
[01:15:34.982 --> 01:15:40.684]  Because every other conspiracy theory that they've pushed has been wrong, and every other conspiracy theory that they said was wrong has turned out right.
[01:15:42.952 --> 01:15:43.212]  Wow!
[01:15:43.593 --> 01:15:44.113]  Powerful!
[01:15:45.235 --> 01:15:46.216]  I've got a lot to cover.
[01:15:46.256 --> 01:15:47.577]  I don't know which one of these top stories.
[01:15:47.757 --> 01:15:48.638]  They're all so insane.
[01:15:49.059 --> 01:15:50.000]  Which one is the top story?
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:51.902]  We're going to come out with something big on the other side.
[01:15:51.922 --> 01:15:53.844]  I've got so much by head spinning.
[01:15:54.144 --> 01:15:55.045]  Robert Barnes is here with us.
[01:15:55.506 --> 01:15:56.287]  Please spread the links.
[01:15:56.367 --> 01:15:59.390]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com and ClownWorld.us.
[01:15:59.911 --> 01:16:00.852]  That gets past the censors.
[01:16:03.455 --> 01:16:12.220]  Let me get into something briefly that is so paramount that it deals with the very essence of the soul and the spark of consciousness and creation.
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:16.282]  Every study documents what we already know in our heart and minds to be true.
[01:16:16.422 --> 01:16:19.524]  That apathy leads to entropy, leads to collapse.
[01:16:19.744 --> 01:16:24.487]  And that if you don't have a purpose-driven life, you will die before your body fails.
[01:16:24.787 --> 01:16:31.612]  Apathy, most common symptom of dementia, science daily, distinct from depression, present in nearly half of patients.
[01:16:31.772 --> 01:16:33.333]  This is out of the University of Exeter.
[01:16:33.513 --> 01:16:43.500]  Apathy is the most common neuropsychiatric symptom of dementia, with a bigger impact on the functioning than memory loss, yet is under-researched and often forgotten.
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:49.444]  And our very way of life is now sitting in front of screens, clicking on things to get dopamine rushes.
[01:16:49.684 --> 01:16:54.607]  And so when you go out in the real world, you don't get a dopamine rush off an owl flying over.
[01:16:55.227 --> 01:16:59.350]  Or the moon, or airplanes flying in the sky like we're in a science fiction movie.
[01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:01.071]  We are science fiction reality.
[01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:10.257]  And just the magic of the universe, and these experiences of falling off your bike, or jumping a dirt hill, or getting in a fist fight, or kissing that girl for the first time.
[01:17:10.397 --> 01:17:20.164]  These are deep experiences that our ancestors experienced, that are rituals within us that open up the gateways to perception in the universe.
[01:17:20.324 --> 01:17:21.905]  We must go through the rituals.
[01:17:22.065 --> 01:17:23.746]  That's why the enemy tries to domesticate people.
[01:17:23.926 --> 01:17:29.169]  Nobody knows how to do math anymore because we use calculators and soon we won't know how to drive cars anymore because they're all gonna be self-driving.
[01:17:29.389 --> 01:17:42.955]  This system is designed to dehumanize us and the people that run it admit they're doing it to dehumanize us because they want us out of the way so the globalists can control the future and so they can dictate the new architecture.
[01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:59.479]  And so, instead of just physically killing us right away, they kill our intellect, they kill our spark, they kill that which makes us higher than the animals, that we can control our own environments, and that we can control our own destinies to a certain extent, and that we can envision things, and then build those things, that we're master builders.
[01:17:59.699 --> 01:18:10.321]  But when you dial into the universe, and the mystic secrets, and all the magic, and the real potential, and the ancestral memories, and the ancestral will, that is, again, electromagnetic,
[01:18:10.481 --> 01:18:23.889]  Electrochemical from you to your most ancient ancestor is an unbroken electromagnetic chain of genetic information that operates as an antenna to receive and transmit as a transceiver into higher dimensions.
[01:18:24.089 --> 01:18:25.449]  This has all been proven scientifically.
[01:18:25.590 --> 01:18:34.274]  The enemy can't stand it when I get on air because I already know all their equations, their operations, and then of course later I can go out and research and they've written and said exactly this, but in their more secretive reports.
[01:18:34.555 --> 01:18:38.397]  Let me just tell you, I'm giving you the big enchilada, okay?
[01:18:39.017 --> 01:18:39.718]  Oh, we're real.
[01:18:40.038 --> 01:18:40.818]  Oh, we're eternal.
[01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:44.440]  And they don't want you to know that because you're awesome.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:51.504]  And they want to lead you with them into their creation that is a leaking, stinking hellhole.
[01:18:51.744 --> 01:18:54.606]  Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[01:18:54.746 --> 01:19:00.850]  Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
[01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:02.751]  It's all in plain view, people.
[01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:11.436]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:11.476 --> 01:19:18.600]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:22.342]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[01:19:22.762 --> 01:19:26.224]  Tellomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[01:19:26.604 --> 01:19:35.008]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[01:19:35.028 --> 01:19:38.369]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[01:19:38.449 --> 01:19:38.709]  Why?
[01:19:38.769 --> 01:19:41.270]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:46.713]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support.
[01:19:47.253 --> 01:19:51.517]  And they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[01:19:51.877 --> 01:19:53.098]  It is the elite supplement.
[01:19:53.558 --> 01:19:57.181]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[01:19:57.221 --> 01:20:03.166]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:20:05.788 --> 01:20:08.451]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:33.124]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:33.305 --> 01:20:38.427]  Boy, if there was a fly on the wall, ladies and gentlemen, of what Robert Barnes and I are talking about.
[01:20:39.408 --> 01:20:42.269]  Big news this Thursday will be announced.
[01:20:42.289 --> 01:20:43.710]  You'll see it all over the national news.
[01:20:43.750 --> 01:20:45.271]  We'll just stop there with Robert Barnes.
[01:20:46.071 --> 01:20:50.254]  And wheels within wheels, we are definitely fighting, taking action, and it's amazing.
[01:20:51.391 --> 01:20:59.718]  But I was asking you during the break, I said, listen, we've got all this news here and the next few seconds we'll play some of the highlights of the insane debate last night and the ratings crashing.
[01:21:00.179 --> 01:21:00.959]  I mean, I'll be honest.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.661]  I went home and watched the show.
[01:21:02.701 --> 01:21:03.601]  I was just sitting here all night.
[01:21:03.902 --> 01:21:06.144]  I couldn't look at them and watch them.
[01:21:06.624 --> 01:21:08.866]  I can listen, but I can't look at Democrats.
[01:21:09.567 --> 01:21:11.688]  So I went home and got on the computer and listened.
[01:21:12.449 --> 01:21:13.150]  I don't know.
[01:21:37.967 --> 01:21:49.991]  This whole thing, where Mario Lopez, who I've always liked, you know, even when you're at the hotel and he introduces the movies you can watch, Mario Lopez is being attacked for saying three-year-old children should be encouraged to be transgender.
[01:21:50.031 --> 01:21:53.032]  No, I mean, that's literally child beyond sexual abuse.
[01:21:53.092 --> 01:21:55.012]  It's identity abuse.
[01:21:55.432 --> 01:21:59.194]  And that ties into Jeffrey Epstein and the sexualization of children and this whole movement.
[01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:00.574]  And so you wanted to speak to that.
[01:22:00.754 --> 01:22:01.114]  Absolutely.
[01:22:01.154 --> 01:22:16.087]  So, to Dershowitz's credit, Professor Dershowitz put out an article, where I disagree with his article, but he pointed out there's an inconsistency between saying that children are children and cannot consent in certain areas and then saying that they absolutely can in other areas.
[01:22:16.127 --> 01:22:16.768]  So, for example...
[01:22:17.128 --> 01:22:45.750]  If you're going to treat children as adults for criminal purposes under juvenile laws, or you're going to treat children as adults for the purposes of getting an abortion without parental consent, or you're going to treat children as adults for picking their gender and being able to do forced various forms of biological experimentation and surgery against parental consent, as happened in Canada, if you're going to talk about three-year-olds picking what gender they are, like Charlie Theron who talked about raising... The state confuses the children and then says, oh, we represent your child now.
[01:22:45.790 --> 01:22:46.891]  It's a form of child kidnapping.
[01:22:47.051 --> 01:22:55.856]  Absolutely, and it's a severe form of mind control in the sense that we recognize... And the Tabastock Institute, who heads up Global Mind Control, admits they created this.
[01:22:56.076 --> 01:22:56.456]  Oh, exactly.
[01:22:56.476 --> 01:23:12.986]  And the reason why you don't want kids voting, and the reason why you don't want kids drafted for the war, and you don't want kids treated as an adult for juvenile crime purposes, and that we have statutory rape crime principles, is because we recognize that until they reach a certain age, they do not have the moral cognizance or emotional maturity
[01:23:13.206 --> 01:23:14.566]  To make those complex decisions.
[01:23:14.586 --> 01:23:18.948]  They didn't do it with, with like capital murder is done with intent, with a conspiracy.
[01:23:19.168 --> 01:23:22.169]  They don't have what it takes to actually make the conscious decision.
[01:23:22.209 --> 01:23:22.969]  They can be manipulated.
[01:23:23.109 --> 01:23:23.469]  Exactly.
[01:23:23.489 --> 01:23:28.911]  And so when you see these trying to have three year olds pick their gender, which is, you know, kids dress up as all kinds of things.
[01:23:28.931 --> 01:23:30.312]  They have no idea what that even means.
[01:23:30.352 --> 01:23:33.873]  And it's easy to trick them into a new role and then say, now that's your role.
[01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:34.413]  Exactly.
[01:23:34.433 --> 01:23:35.814]  So tell the kid you're a superhero.
[01:23:35.934 --> 01:23:36.414]  Exactly.
[01:23:36.434 --> 01:23:43.296]  They're sexualizing them and making identity a social construct rather than a biological reality, when we all know it's a biological reality.
[01:23:43.556 --> 01:23:47.898]  There's nobody in the biological sciences that's propagating some of this absurd nonsense.
[01:23:48.198 --> 01:23:59.922]  So it reflects a deep, severe disconnect between biological reality and social reality, a disconnect between our laws recognizing that children are not of the moral cognizance or intellectual capability to make these kind of decisions.
[01:23:59.942 --> 01:24:00.502]  And let's be clear.
[01:24:01.584 --> 01:24:03.984]  People biologically go through the clock.
[01:24:04.024 --> 01:24:07.285]  So before they hit puberty, they're basically asexual.
[01:24:07.605 --> 01:24:08.065]  Absolutely.
[01:24:08.445 --> 01:24:12.266]  And so it's a trick before they go through what they really are.
[01:24:12.646 --> 01:24:15.146]  I mean, when I hit puberty at 12, I became a killer.
[01:24:15.426 --> 01:24:17.267]  And I was after, because I wasn't stunted.
[01:24:17.327 --> 01:24:18.127]  I was after women.
[01:24:18.407 --> 01:24:19.047]  I was in fights.
[01:24:19.067 --> 01:24:19.747]  People wanted to fight.
[01:24:19.767 --> 01:24:20.167]  It was on.
[01:24:20.387 --> 01:24:21.667]  Before, I was a little sweetie pie.
[01:24:21.988 --> 01:24:25.208]  As soon as the testosterone kicked on, look out, Godzilla's here.
[01:24:25.428 --> 01:24:26.148]  Well, they know that.
[01:24:26.188 --> 01:24:30.189]  But if they could have tricked me earlier on, I'd have been happy to sit there and put on a dress
[01:24:30.489 --> 01:24:32.589]  You know, and sit there and cook pancakes or whatever.
[01:24:32.829 --> 01:24:36.950]  So again, they are stunting and coming in early to steal the future potential.
[01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:42.712]  Just several years ago, we would have universally recognized this as child abuse, what's going on.
[01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:44.312]  It's hardcore child abuse.
[01:24:44.452 --> 01:24:46.792]  Absolutely it is, because it's confusing children.
[01:24:46.812 --> 01:24:54.234]  By the way, you shouldn't be praised as having courage to say this, but this guy says you shouldn't sexualize three-year-olds and they're trying to take his job away.
[01:24:54.514 --> 01:24:55.515]  Exactly, they're attacking him.
[01:24:55.736 --> 01:25:05.308]  There's public calls on social media today for him to lose his shows, for him to lose his audience, for him to lose any contracts that he has, solely for saying what is morally and intellectually obviously true.
[01:25:05.408 --> 01:25:06.990]  But here's the thing, he won't lose his soul though.
[01:25:07.351 --> 01:25:10.195]  Right, well exactly, that's what he cares more about, and that's more consequential.
[01:25:10.575 --> 01:25:29.489]  But amazing that we live in an era where it's controversial to say you should not sexualize three-year-old children, and you should not have three-year-old children trying to make decisions that the law recognizes they are not morally, intellectually, or emotionally capable of making, and to try to ask them to do so, does so in a way that violates their core sense of identity and their capabilities.
[01:25:29.749 --> 01:25:36.294]  So it's legally offensive, it's morally offensive, it's intellectually offensive, it's just an outrage from top to bottom.
[01:25:37.335 --> 01:25:39.017]  Full assault with Caitlyn Jenner.
[01:25:39.098 --> 01:25:39.358]  All of it.
[01:25:39.378 --> 01:25:40.439]  It's a full corporate rollout.
[01:25:40.459 --> 01:25:41.241]  So the question is why?
[01:25:41.755 --> 01:25:57.061]  Well, what you get is you end up getting the, I'll give Dershowitz credit, while I disagree with his conclusion, what he's right about is that the law... Yeah, why do you go to jail for a 16-year-old girl, but it's okay to have little kids sitting on the laps of trannies, riding horsey, telling them they're a whole other sex?
[01:25:57.481 --> 01:25:57.822]  Exactly.
[01:25:57.842 --> 01:26:02.023]  Whether he intended to or not, Dershowitz drew what the logical conclusion of this ideology is.
[01:26:02.043 --> 01:26:03.004]  Which is what it's designed to do.
[01:26:03.184 --> 01:26:03.644]  Exactly.
[01:26:04.424 --> 01:26:09.486]  It's to greenlight Epstein's relationships, to greenlight pedophilia, to greenlight child abuse.
[01:26:09.506 --> 01:26:10.767]  Which is the final revolution.
[01:26:11.227 --> 01:26:14.109]  Absolutely, and it's the most anti-human act.
[01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:16.191]  Stealing the innocence of children.
[01:26:16.391 --> 01:26:18.853]  Absolutely, and it reduces their humanity and their individuality.
[01:26:18.873 --> 01:26:19.474]  They're just cattle.
[01:26:19.494 --> 01:26:20.414]  They're there for a purpose.
[01:26:20.434 --> 01:26:26.319]  Because again, you grow up your adults, your power to progenerate into the future is the prime drive.
[01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:32.384]  Men and women choose to come together in the greatest democracy the planet's ever seen to create new beings.
[01:26:32.944 --> 01:26:36.787]  They're jacking in and stealing that whole potentiality, stealing that from them.
[01:26:37.267 --> 01:26:38.048]  I mean, that's incredible.
[01:26:38.228 --> 01:26:41.450]  And there's a great degree of population replacement that's taking place here.
[01:26:41.490 --> 01:26:57.638]  So as we have fewer children, as abortion is increasingly incentivized, as we basically have American populations in the West not reproducing at a rate that can replace our own population, then we become more and more dependent on foreign populations that they believe are more malleable.
[01:26:57.978 --> 01:27:05.585]  In the 1960s Ford Foundation documents they said we will promote transhumanism, sexless society, that's what Brave New World 1932 is written about.
[01:27:05.665 --> 01:27:06.786]  This has been a long-term plan.
[01:27:07.086 --> 01:27:08.788]  Barnes, I love it when you get on every subject.
[01:27:09.228 --> 01:27:10.810]  You always cover law or this or that.
[01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:11.610]  You're a smart guy.
[01:27:11.871 --> 01:27:12.852]  We need to get you on our show.
[01:27:13.432 --> 01:27:13.973]  Sure, that'd be fun.
[01:27:14.253 --> 01:27:14.713]  We need to do it.
[01:27:14.833 --> 01:27:15.214]  Absolutely.
[01:27:15.234 --> 01:27:15.694]  We need to do it.
[01:27:15.994 --> 01:27:18.457]  Let me hit some of these headlines here just to show you how committed
[01:27:19.687 --> 01:27:23.089]  Procter & Gamble has lost $5 billion since six months ago.
[01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:25.209]  They ran that ad saying being men are bad.
[01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:27.070]  All men are rapists.
[01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:31.552]  Shaving is, you know, part of rape or something.
[01:27:31.572 --> 01:27:32.273]  It's totally bizarre.
[01:27:32.613 --> 01:27:37.455]  Procter & Gamble loses $5 billion following woke Gillette ad campaign.
[01:27:38.948 --> 01:27:47.430]  ACLU blames inaccurate stereotypes for opposition to male athletes and girls sports now ruining girls sports and taking over.
[01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:51.611]  No, you have double the size bones, way bigger muscles, more blood volume.
[01:27:51.711 --> 01:27:52.571]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:27:52.812 --> 01:27:54.432]  The ACLU says, oh, it's a stereotype.
[01:27:54.892 --> 01:27:59.053]  And again, Mario Lopez is being attacked for saying three-year-old children should be encouraged to be transgender.
[01:27:59.073 --> 01:28:01.994]  That is total robbing their future beyond pedophilia.
[01:28:02.734 --> 01:28:06.975]  But don't worry, this is also in Europe and the U.S., but in Australia, no more kisses from granny.
[01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:11.977]  Aussie program from the government tells kids granny hugging you or kissing you is pedophilia.
[01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:23.480]  So your own granny touching you is bad, but going and sitting on a man in a clown suit and riding horsey while he grinds you in pedophilic delight, that's liberal and loving.
[01:28:24.392 --> 01:28:27.454]  Exactly, and that's what's happening, and we're doing that in public school libraries.
[01:28:27.714 --> 01:28:29.996]  This sort of sanctified place for learning.
[01:28:30.036 --> 01:28:32.238]  The library is now a pedo breeding ground.
[01:28:32.758 --> 01:28:38.162]  Look at this, Australia, sculpture of man's chest banned from art exhibit because Muslims don't like it.
[01:28:38.562 --> 01:28:38.902]  Exactly.
[01:28:39.162 --> 01:28:43.826]  So men's chests are bad, Greek statues are bad, but
[01:28:44.892 --> 01:28:45.693]  Pedophilia is okay.
[01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:49.576]  Now that's the new normal in the abnormal of the left today.
[01:28:49.936 --> 01:28:52.178]  And it shows a degree in the severity and the insanity of it.
[01:28:52.598 --> 01:29:00.585]  I mean, it's just what, what just three years ago would be... Well, when Obama's policies and platform is considered far right in the modern democratic party... They're pushing the envelope.
[01:29:00.645 --> 01:29:01.046]  Exactly.
[01:29:05.029 --> 01:29:06.830]  Let's go to James in Massachusetts.
[01:29:07.171 --> 01:29:07.851]  James, you're on the air.
[01:29:07.871 --> 01:29:08.452]  Thanks for calling.
[01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.729]  Hello, Alex.
[01:29:11.350 --> 01:29:13.211]  God bless General Jones.
[01:29:13.271 --> 01:29:15.452]  May you live in peace and love forever.
[01:29:15.492 --> 01:29:16.552]  In Christ's name, we pray.
[01:29:16.673 --> 01:29:17.413]  God bless you, brother.
[01:29:17.653 --> 01:29:18.894]  And I'd like to thank you also.
[01:29:18.934 --> 01:29:22.255]  You know, my wife and I have been married for 17 years, and we were never able to have kids.
[01:29:22.355 --> 01:29:31.480]  And after a couple years of taking the B12 and the iodine, and knowing about not using fluoride and not having vaccines, we have a great, healthy, vibrant, six-year-old boy.
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.841]  And I thank you very much for that.
[01:29:32.961 --> 01:29:35.643]  Well, you know, fluoride is meant to block fertility.
[01:29:36.084 --> 01:29:39.087]  It's the bad halogen, but iodine is associated with fertility.
[01:29:39.547 --> 01:29:40.648]  So that's a beautiful story.
[01:29:40.668 --> 01:29:41.689]  That's exciting, my friend.
[01:29:41.829 --> 01:29:46.033]  And I've got all the articles right here about IQ, fertility, being boosted on iodine.
[01:29:46.613 --> 01:29:47.054]  You name it.
[01:29:47.314 --> 01:29:51.378]  That's why the system fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here.
[01:29:51.418 --> 01:29:53.680]  Even though I get it from infomorestore.com, it doesn't matter to me.
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:56.022]  Just research what deficiencies are doing.
[01:29:56.162 --> 01:29:59.305]  But get back to you and your wife and recap the story you were telling.
[01:29:59.485 --> 01:30:22.994]  So we've been married for 17 years and we never had any children and we bought the water filter first and we cut out the fluoride and the glyphosate and then we started taking X2 and B12 and about a year or so later my wife got pregnant with our baby boy and with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's so bright and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you and then you're our hero Alex.
[01:30:23.174 --> 01:30:24.496]  Well, that's just beautiful, brother.
[01:30:24.796 --> 01:30:27.939]  And again, it shows the system knows all this.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:32.625]  And it works to keep the people from just getting basic things the body has to have.
[01:30:32.665 --> 01:30:35.188]  You have to have vitamin C. You have to have iodine.
[01:30:35.528 --> 01:30:36.389]  You have to have water.
[01:30:36.729 --> 01:30:37.691]  You have to have oxygen.
[01:30:38.131 --> 01:30:40.473]  Instead, the whole system works to block that.
[01:30:40.593 --> 01:30:41.634]  It's just so powerful.
[01:30:41.714 --> 01:30:42.775]  It's what we're made of.
[01:30:42.895 --> 01:30:45.198]  And I'm sitting here trying to explain this to people.
[01:30:45.218 --> 01:30:46.599]  We're not just making this stuff up.
[01:30:46.779 --> 01:30:47.880]  It's just everything.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.802]  But again, the other iodines are bound.
[01:30:49.822 --> 01:30:50.923]  You don't absorb them.
[01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:52.785]  Everyone calls their iodine atomic.
[01:30:53.025 --> 01:30:55.467]  I wish everyone else was selling atomic iodine.
[01:30:55.547 --> 01:30:55.948]  They're not.
[01:30:56.108 --> 01:30:57.769]  Impleorstore.com or AAA2533139.
[01:31:05.553 --> 01:31:18.043]  You know, the top Nazi, Werner Von Braun, wrote a 1959 book, or 1949 book, I'm going for memory here, called Project Mars, where the Elons are the aliens who end up taking over the Earth.
[01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:19.324]  Beware the Elon.
[01:31:20.305 --> 01:31:21.666]  And the Elon invasion.
[01:31:21.926 --> 01:31:23.267]  Dr. Werner Von Braun.
[01:31:23.428 --> 01:31:24.088]  Wonder what he knew.
[01:31:24.268 --> 01:31:30.994]  When I watched his promo about this, with executives from his company, they all look like they're on hardcore drugs.
[01:31:31.054 --> 01:31:33.696]  I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up,
[01:31:35.512 --> 01:31:36.852]  I mean, they look nuts.
[01:31:37.213 --> 01:31:38.393]  You know when somebody's on drugs.
[01:31:38.413 --> 01:31:42.074]  You know, they admit Silicon Valley is into hardcore speed and hallucinogens.
[01:31:42.214 --> 01:31:45.676]  They're taking IV drips at work of DMT.
[01:31:45.836 --> 01:31:50.837]  They're taking LSD microdoses and psilocybin mushrooms and peyote every day.
[01:31:51.197 --> 01:31:52.478]  Who in the hell
[01:31:53.078 --> 01:31:54.319]  would want to join with these people.
[01:31:54.419 --> 01:31:56.901]  I've seen people take like three hits of acid and their eyes aren't that big.
[01:31:56.961 --> 01:31:57.822]  What the hell are they on?
[01:31:57.962 --> 01:32:12.655]  And one of the crew members said maybe they've already got this whole neuro-linked virus hooks in their brain because as PKD pointed out, Philip K. Dick back in the 70s, the cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want, just plug in, but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days.
[01:32:12.675 --> 01:32:16.178]  You just die because you just plug all this in and it's the Matrix.
[01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:18.700]  And now the Matrix is here and you look at Tim Cook and
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.781]  Or Elon Musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage.
[01:32:21.941 --> 01:32:23.342]  They'll be under white lights.
[01:32:23.562 --> 01:32:26.023]  Their pupils are 90% open.
[01:32:26.203 --> 01:32:28.944]  Zuckerberg, all of them, these people either have brain chips.
[01:32:29.164 --> 01:32:29.644]  That's it.
[01:32:30.004 --> 01:32:32.125]  These guys are wireheads.
[01:32:32.305 --> 01:32:33.806]  Something's going on.
[01:32:34.086 --> 01:32:38.248]  I'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils are very little.
[01:32:38.328 --> 01:32:39.208]  Now zoom in if you can.
[01:32:39.248 --> 01:32:41.129]  My pupils are tiny because I'm not on drugs.
[01:32:41.829 --> 01:32:43.110]  I've had two cups of coffee today.
[01:32:43.290 --> 01:32:44.971]  So here, let me show you my pupils, okay?
[01:32:45.171 --> 01:32:46.392]  My pupils are little.
[01:32:46.452 --> 01:32:47.593]  They're supposed to close!
[01:32:47.753 --> 01:32:50.675]  That's what happens under the sun or under bright lights, but not these guys.
[01:32:50.735 --> 01:32:56.299]  These are drug addicts, and they want the hit of wires in their brains, and all of them have got those giant pupils.
[01:32:57.460 --> 01:32:59.702]  Because they've been there, and they ain't coming back.
[01:33:06.767 --> 01:33:09.389]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:30.535]  I'm burning inside.
[01:33:32.136 --> 01:33:35.256]  Oh, yeah.
[01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:36.457]  I am burning inside.
[01:33:38.277 --> 01:33:42.938]  Burning from the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:43.018 --> 01:33:46.839]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[01:33:47.399 --> 01:33:51.000]  New World Order.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:54.941]  The New World Order.
[01:33:56.682 --> 01:33:58.102]  I've had some fun listening to this song.
[01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:10.033]  Thanks for joining us, folks.
[01:34:12.894 --> 01:34:14.574]  Alright, we're starting to get into the debate last night.
[01:34:14.594 --> 01:34:21.236]  I do intend to try to open the phones up here, but we've got so much to cover and some really interesting things that I'm not going to announce yet until next hour.
[01:34:21.596 --> 01:34:23.057]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, is here with us.
[01:34:23.077 --> 01:34:24.157]  Let me just briefly remind folks.
[01:34:25.492 --> 01:34:35.017]  That's probably once during this special fundraiser we're doing to help stabilize the operation and launch a few new little covert operations.
[01:34:36.698 --> 01:34:40.660]  Stop the Clown Storewide Mega Sale.
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:45.483]  50 to 60% off all InfoWars Live formulas, free shipping, and double Patriot Points.
[01:34:45.883 --> 01:34:52.907]  We brought back the Mega Special to help you support InfoWars and help stop the whole Clown World operation.
[01:34:54.045 --> 01:34:58.947]  Get 50% off to 60% off all InfoWars Live formulas, free shipping, double page repoints and more.
[01:34:59.687 --> 01:35:05.970]  This could be your last chance to stock up on top InfoWars Live formulas before they are completely out of stock.
[01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:14.713]  Because I've got a big stock of some things and I could sell out of all that stuff, never restock it and fund for six months.
[01:35:15.513 --> 01:35:16.574]  But then if I don't restock,
[01:35:18.439 --> 01:35:22.001]  Because everybody loves the supplements, we would have to contract and maybe even shut down in a year.
[01:35:22.642 --> 01:35:24.323]  So, that's the math that goes into this.
[01:35:24.403 --> 01:35:28.345]  I need a lot of extra money to buy the products to keep having them in the future.
[01:35:28.886 --> 01:35:37.491]  Whether it's the Wake Up America Coffee that's highest rated out there, or the Colloidal Silver Fortified and Fluoride Free Super Blue Toothpaste.
[01:35:37.551 --> 01:35:39.913]  I mean, a lot of stuff goes into business.
[01:35:40.433 --> 01:35:43.035]  And I use business to fund this operation.
[01:35:43.075 --> 01:35:44.976]  We don't have a sugar daddy like
[01:35:46.479 --> 01:35:49.302]  Bill Gates, or the Ford Foundation, or George Soros.
[01:35:49.322 --> 01:35:49.842]  We have you.
[01:35:51.624 --> 01:35:58.250]  So, the warehouse has confirmed we're already selling out of Survival Shield, X2, Nacin Iodine, Super Metal Vitality, and DNA Force.
[01:35:59.271 --> 01:36:02.233]  Now is the time to secure your order before they completely sell out.
[01:36:02.694 --> 01:36:08.479]  Take advantage of this massive special and support the defense of free speech and reality at InfoWorksStore.com.
[01:36:10.133 --> 01:36:11.554]  Up to 60% off InfoWars Life.
[01:36:12.095 --> 01:36:13.356]  High quality, storable food.
[01:36:13.376 --> 01:36:15.217]  That's a private label from MyPatriotSupply.
[01:36:15.838 --> 01:36:23.524]  We didn't have them for a sponsor for about six months because they had a shakeup in the company just because all the other distributors were pissed that I did a special private label deal to go lower than anybody else.
[01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:24.485]  That's what I do.
[01:36:25.205 --> 01:36:28.848]  We did become the biggest distributor, by the way, but it really is high quality, storable food at the lowest price you'll find.
[01:36:29.309 --> 01:36:31.410]  Real Red Pill Plus that I never talk enough about.
[01:36:31.871 --> 01:36:34.393]  And Real Red Pill doesn't have a stimulant in it.
[01:36:34.813 --> 01:36:35.594]  Those are both 60% off.
[01:36:35.614 --> 01:36:38.196]  By the way, they're the biggest game changers.
[01:36:40.031 --> 01:36:42.513]  Takes a week or so for him to kick in, though, okay?
[01:36:42.753 --> 01:36:53.421]  Well, Real Red Pill Plus kicks in in 30 minutes because it has a stimulant, a natural stimulant added to it, but the Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus also has the preglanone or a bunch of other key things that are building blocks to all the hormones in the body.
[01:36:53.782 --> 01:36:58.045]  You add that with X2, you add that with selenium, you add that with bone broth, you add that with a few other things.
[01:36:58.145 --> 01:36:59.746]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:37:00.247 --> 01:37:01.648]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:08.212]  You can also make straight-up donations there that really help this operation.
[01:37:08.492 --> 01:37:09.212]  So thank you all.
[01:37:09.232 --> 01:37:19.197]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com or InfoWars.com forward slash show where you can see the space shuttle we have there with the money coming in, the goal of raising a million dollars gross sales and donations.
[01:37:20.615 --> 01:37:24.018]  Which, again, helps us secure new operations we want to run.
[01:37:24.438 --> 01:37:27.901]  And again, the space shuttle has some secret payloads in it as well.
[01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:33.045]  When it goes up into orbit, it's got some things you'll never know about until maybe five, ten years from now.
[01:37:33.925 --> 01:37:38.029]  But there's a lot of little payloads in there, and we're very judicious about the money we spend.
[01:37:38.069 --> 01:37:39.230]  We know what we're doing.
[01:37:39.810 --> 01:37:44.553]  And we're promoting freedom, so our $1 to the enemy's $1,000,000 is equivalent.
[01:37:44.974 --> 01:37:49.237]  But they spent billions against us alone, tens of billions against Trump, and they're failing.
[01:37:49.957 --> 01:37:55.301]  But again, we need to get that payload into orbit, so we need to launch those operations.
[01:37:55.321 --> 01:37:57.083]  So please make donations straight up.
[01:37:57.103 --> 01:37:58.524]  You can also call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:37:58.544 --> 01:37:58.584]  888-253-3139.
[01:37:58.624 --> 01:38:00.145]  Want to make just a credit card donation?
[01:38:00.185 --> 01:38:00.905]  You want to mail in checks?
[01:38:01.266 --> 01:38:01.946]  There's a P.O.
[01:38:02.006 --> 01:38:02.206]  box.
[01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.850]  There as well.
[01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:09.911]  We used to, years ago, get a lot of big donations.
[01:38:10.352 --> 01:38:15.134]  Nowadays, people just purchase things to support, but we might make 20% on sales this big.
[01:38:15.714 --> 01:38:19.616]  Where we sell a lot more, still, sometimes, it doesn't cut it.
[01:38:19.696 --> 01:38:20.837]  Because I don't really do marketing.
[01:38:21.297 --> 01:38:22.998]  I just love to give you great products at great prices.
[01:38:23.438 --> 01:38:27.240]  And so, you're habituated, I get it, when someone has a major discount that you buy.
[01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:28.360]  So, it's a catch-22.
[01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:34.123]  So, just please, get the staples you already need from us, and know that you're really affecting change worldwide.
[01:38:34.483 --> 01:38:37.564]  Robert Barnes, the next two segments, we're going to get into, obviously, the debates.
[01:38:37.884 --> 01:38:39.565]  Your overall view of the debates last night.
[01:38:40.085 --> 01:38:50.149]  So, I mean, I thought, I mean, going in, sort of my analysis for people who follow me on the sort of political betting markets is, was that Bernie was the one that was most likely to get a boost from a betting market perspective.
[01:38:50.509 --> 01:38:50.909]  And he did.
[01:38:51.269 --> 01:38:54.630]  People who bet on Bernie got a 35% rate of return profit overnight.
[01:38:55.571 --> 01:39:01.153]  So the, I think from a betting perspective, and I think from a sort of prognostication perspective, and as we were talking about last night,
[01:39:01.573 --> 01:39:05.095]  It's amazing how you have all these analysts who are so terrible at prognostication.
[01:39:05.395 --> 01:39:10.718]  If you can't predict or forecast what's going to happen, you really are out of touch with the world and really shouldn't be analyzing anything.
[01:39:11.879 --> 01:39:13.220]  And many of them were sort of misplaced.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:23.606]  And as we also forecast, Marianne Williamson would be the most searched candidate, because she's the weirdest by far, and she says the most interesting, eclectic things, even when it's completely nuts.
[01:39:23.646 --> 01:39:25.187]  By the way, that's our biggest failing.
[01:39:26.266 --> 01:39:32.571]  Is that you and Owen the last two times exactly forecast to a level I couldn't even do.
[01:39:33.331 --> 01:39:36.774]  And then we would have crew to go back where you said that where you did it.
[01:39:37.294 --> 01:39:40.416]  But you guys did it all before the debate and you're all on record.
[01:39:40.616 --> 01:39:41.137]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:39:41.557 --> 01:39:45.359]  Also, put it up on Twitter so that people can see in live time and in real time.
[01:39:45.399 --> 01:39:46.079]  Here's the prediction.
[01:39:46.339 --> 01:39:48.400]  Now, of course, you can't find me on Twitter because Twitter has me.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:50.220]  If you look up Barnes Law, I don't exist.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:50.861]  You're Shadow Man.
[01:39:50.901 --> 01:39:55.963]  But let's pull up your actual Twitter because, in fact, you went on and made the prediction a month ago, too.
[01:39:56.143 --> 01:39:56.703]  Yes, correct.
[01:39:56.723 --> 01:39:59.224]  That Marianne Williamson would be the most searched for person.
[01:40:00.024 --> 01:40:03.306]  And then it was that Tulsi Gabbard would get the biggest boost in the betting markets.
[01:40:03.326 --> 01:40:03.946]  And that's what happened.
[01:40:04.626 --> 01:40:05.307]  Exactly.
[01:40:05.347 --> 01:40:06.347]  In both cases, that's what's happening.
[01:40:06.367 --> 01:40:08.128]  And you guys called it again last night.
[01:40:08.308 --> 01:40:08.949]  Yep.
[01:40:08.989 --> 01:40:11.070]  That's because Owen's a sports guy, so are you.
[01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:13.031]  I mean, he just obsesses over it.
[01:40:13.051 --> 01:40:14.092]  Well, it's also having objectives.
[01:40:14.112 --> 01:40:21.656]  There's a reason why InfoWars is the only media brand of this scale and this scope in the world that's not dependent on billionaires.
[01:40:21.736 --> 01:40:22.556]  It's not dependent on corporations.
[01:40:22.596 --> 01:40:23.117]  Let's be clear.
[01:40:23.137 --> 01:40:24.477]  Media can make good predictions, too.
[01:40:24.517 --> 01:40:25.438]  They're told what to say.
[01:40:25.738 --> 01:40:26.539]  Exactly, that's the problem.
[01:40:26.579 --> 01:40:28.722]  And not only that, why do they continue to promote losers?
[01:40:28.802 --> 01:40:30.164]  Because losers stay on script.
[01:40:30.584 --> 01:40:38.474]  So the reason why this audience gets access to information and intel that nobody else does is because this audience makes it a reality by supporting in-fours.
[01:40:38.515 --> 01:40:41.919]  And again, scroll into some of his tweets where he predicted this all before it even started last night.
[01:40:42.119 --> 01:40:42.479]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:42.659 --> 01:40:43.520]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:51.064]  And so, it's the audience that makes real their own access to intel and information that they get to share with their friends and family and people around the world.
[01:40:51.144 --> 01:40:53.646]  And everything is about how accurate and authentic you are.
[01:40:53.766 --> 01:40:54.066]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:54.086 --> 01:40:55.066]  Which the corporate media doesn't get.
[01:40:55.086 --> 01:40:56.607]  They're all wanting a billionaire to fund them.
[01:40:56.967 --> 01:40:59.789]  We all get funded by being authentic, so we're fighting to be authentic.
[01:40:59.829 --> 01:41:00.089]  Exactly.
[01:41:00.109 --> 01:41:08.534]  I mean, they have to have teleprompters and they have to have scripts because otherwise they might upset or offend some advertiser, some donor, some big corporate contributor, some billionaire.
[01:41:08.894 --> 01:41:10.375]  It's all been screened by 20 lawyers.
[01:41:10.495 --> 01:41:10.755]  Exactly.
[01:41:10.775 --> 01:41:19.878]  You would see a publication like The Intercept, which is actually a popular publication, and does do some anti-war stuff, but they propagated a lot of the Russiagate nonsense, even though their editor said it was nonsense.
[01:41:20.198 --> 01:41:20.438]  Why?
[01:41:20.498 --> 01:41:23.639]  Because one of their billionaire backers is a big Trump hater.
[01:41:23.759 --> 01:41:25.320]  So we don't have to propagate anything.
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:31.822]  So the consequence is people get to get independent insight and information that's actually accurate in forecasting and foreshadowing what happened.
[01:41:32.082 --> 01:41:45.608]  I mean, whether you're talking about the New York Fire Commissioners talking about reopening 9-11, whether you're talking about Japan going into animal-human hybrid experimentation, or whether you're talking about last night's debate, they're able to get Intel tomorrow's news today, literally, because the audience makes it a functional reality.
[01:41:45.928 --> 01:41:51.471]  So I think that what happened is you saw that last night, I think Buttigieg fell in the betting markets.
[01:41:51.491 --> 01:41:52.852]  I think Buttigieg is almost dead.
[01:41:52.872 --> 01:41:55.813]  I mean, he's only living off big donors at this point.
[01:41:56.413 --> 01:41:58.214]  You're seeing, and that's why he's coming up with more...
[01:41:58.234 --> 01:42:00.835]  Anyway, speaking of Buttigieg, let's play a quick clip.
[01:42:01.375 --> 01:42:03.296]  The Earth's now ending in 10 years.
[01:42:03.336 --> 01:42:04.297]  He's out doing AOC.
[01:42:04.317 --> 01:42:04.577]  Here it is.
[01:42:04.597 --> 01:42:04.777]  Exactly.
[01:42:04.817 --> 01:42:05.297]  He had to.
[01:42:05.857 --> 01:42:12.440]  Ask yourself how somebody like Donald Trump ever gets within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.
[01:42:13.121 --> 01:42:16.042]  It doesn't happen unless America is already in a crisis.
[01:42:16.622 --> 01:42:18.463]  An economy that's not working for everyone.
[01:42:18.943 --> 01:42:19.583]  Endless war.
[01:42:19.683 --> 01:42:20.344]  Climate change.
[01:42:21.044 --> 01:42:24.385]  We have lived this in my industrial Midwestern hometown.
[01:42:24.865 --> 01:42:27.926]  My generation has lived this as long as we have been alive.
[01:42:28.186 --> 01:42:29.346]  And it's only accelerating.
[01:42:30.106 --> 01:42:36.728]  Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate.
[01:42:37.048 --> 01:42:41.389]  By 2030, the average house in this country will cost half a million bucks.
[01:42:41.949 --> 01:42:44.710]  And a woman's right to choose may not even exist.
[01:42:45.905 --> 01:42:55.131]  We're not going to be able to meet this moment by recycling the same arguments, policies, and politicians that have dominated Washington for as long as I have been alive.
[01:42:55.631 --> 01:42:58.933]  We've got to summon the courage to walk away from the past.
[01:42:58.953 --> 01:43:00.955]  I've got to do what he says because he's gay.
[01:43:06.007 --> 01:43:07.108]  Go ahead, Jerome.
[01:43:07.249 --> 01:43:08.410]  Hey guys, good evening.
[01:43:08.450 --> 01:43:08.911]  How are you?
[01:43:08.971 --> 01:43:09.591]  We're doing great.
[01:43:09.611 --> 01:43:10.052]  Good, good.
[01:43:10.152 --> 01:43:16.460]  Hey, I bought one of those gravity filters from you guys about a couple years back and you know, it started working real good.
[01:43:16.500 --> 01:43:20.425]  I said, golly, this is a good, golly, I don't have to carry water back up to my apartment.
[01:43:20.465 --> 01:43:23.068]  So it lasted about six months and it started not dripping.
[01:43:23.208 --> 01:43:23.528]  That's true.
[01:43:44.269 --> 01:43:48.370]  Yeah, you just scrub the outside because it's just building up with garbage on the outside of that filter.
[01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:53.732]  Oh man, I'll tell you what, the little white filters, those things turn like golden, man.
[01:43:53.832 --> 01:44:00.754]  And when the water goes down, when it goes down, when there's a little, you know, a little bit of water left in the top reservoir, it smells like a septic tank.
[01:44:00.794 --> 01:44:01.034]  Yeah.
[01:44:01.074 --> 01:44:04.895]  You know, I mean, that's why these people up here vote for somebody like that AOC.
[01:44:05.095 --> 01:44:07.016]  I mean, you know, they're exposing their...
[01:44:07.296 --> 01:44:10.178]  They're exposing themselves to God knows what kind of chemicals, man.
[01:44:10.198 --> 01:44:14.801]  I mean, that's one thing I used to do was work in those water filtration out there in California.
[01:44:14.821 --> 01:44:20.864]  And I mean, out there they didn't put the hydrochloric acid in, but they did use other stuff like that zinc orthophosphate.
[01:44:20.924 --> 01:44:22.105]  That's a rust inhibitor.
[01:44:22.125 --> 01:44:23.325]  I mean, you're drinking that.
[01:44:23.406 --> 01:44:24.046]  And the chlorine.
[01:44:24.286 --> 01:44:25.367]  Chlorine's not good for you.
[01:44:25.407 --> 01:44:26.067]  You're drinking them.
[01:44:26.107 --> 01:44:29.729]  They use like sodium hypochloride, chlorine, but they did use ozone.
[01:44:29.769 --> 01:44:33.471]  There was some of the municipalities that had ozone generators.
[01:44:33.491 --> 01:44:35.112]  That was really unique.
[01:44:35.152 --> 01:44:39.995]  But I want to tell you, this water in New York, man, I got filters on my shower.
[01:44:40.015 --> 01:44:43.137]  I told my wife, I said, look, when you wash your hands, make sure you dry them.
[01:44:43.177 --> 01:44:43.677]  Feel good.
[01:44:43.697 --> 01:44:45.518]  Don't let the water lay off your hands.
[01:44:46.879 --> 01:44:48.660]  I mean, this stuff is bad, man.
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:53.282]  That's why, like I say, that's why they vote for somebody like that AOC up here that burns the brain up.
[01:44:53.582 --> 01:44:54.602]  I like AOC.
[01:44:54.962 --> 01:44:55.723]  It's AOC!
[01:44:56.863 --> 01:44:59.824]  You can't expose yourself to those chemicals over time.
[01:44:59.904 --> 01:45:00.925]  I mean, it just eats you up.
[01:45:09.309 --> 01:45:11.510]  We're going to talk to Jason in Florida.
[01:45:12.190 --> 01:45:13.411]  Jason, thanks for calling in.
[01:45:13.691 --> 01:45:15.091]  What's your view on the situation?
[01:45:15.312 --> 01:45:16.352]  How should Trump take action?
[01:45:16.372 --> 01:45:19.013]  Mr. Jones, first of all, I'd like to plug products.
[01:45:19.313 --> 01:45:21.754]  My son and I are both big Super Blue fans.
[01:45:21.874 --> 01:45:26.076]  My son also takes the Honor Roll, which is a fantastic product.
[01:45:26.136 --> 01:45:28.817]  Originally, they wanted to test him for ADHD.
[01:45:28.897 --> 01:45:30.418]  Well, that wasn't the case at all.
[01:45:30.458 --> 01:45:32.018]  He's just a really smart kid.
[01:45:32.118 --> 01:45:36.380]  So the Honor Roll product, amazing, amazing results from that product.
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.461]  Mr. Jones, thank you very much for everything.
[01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:41.942]  Since you raised it, it's doing our research with top companies.
[01:45:42.023 --> 01:45:47.465]  It's one of the highest rated blends of fish oil, particularly with small caplets for children.
[01:45:47.485 --> 01:45:49.686]  And it's had the mercury taken out of it.
[01:45:50.166 --> 01:45:52.967]  And they found that it's really a missing link in a lot of young people's brains.
[01:45:53.408 --> 01:45:54.288]  What effect did it have?
[01:45:54.528 --> 01:45:56.530]  I actually allowed him to focus.
[01:45:56.610 --> 01:46:00.533]  As a five-year-old kid, he was having a little trouble staying in his seat and things like that.
[01:46:00.713 --> 01:46:02.374]  And, you know, I feed him well.
[01:46:02.454 --> 01:46:03.375]  He exercises.
[01:46:03.415 --> 01:46:05.177]  We swim every day and things like that.
[01:46:05.257 --> 01:46:12.142]  But the reality is, I just think his diet was missing something that over the last year of using the Honor Roll product, off the charts.
[01:46:12.222 --> 01:46:14.604]  He's testing in the top percentages of his class.
[01:46:14.824 --> 01:46:16.966]  And it's just, people are beside themselves.
[01:46:17.086 --> 01:46:18.968]  And, you know, I swear by the product.
[01:46:19.188 --> 01:46:19.528]  I wouldn't
[01:46:19.628 --> 01:46:20.368]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:46:20.408 --> 01:46:21.089]  I think so.
[01:46:21.109 --> 01:46:21.409]  I think so.
[01:46:21.449 --> 01:46:21.889]  I think so.
[01:46:21.949 --> 01:46:22.369]  I think so.
[01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:22.809]  I think so.
[01:46:22.849 --> 01:46:23.150]  I think so.
[01:46:38.496 --> 01:46:39.837]  Jason, thank you for your support.
[01:46:40.058 --> 01:46:42.220]  Good, clean fish oil, or krill oil.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:43.241]  There's nothing better.
[01:46:43.281 --> 01:46:49.908]  I mean, with my own children, one of my daughters, she can kind of get up, low blood sugar, be a little bit grumpy, get her to eat some basic food, then she's not grumpy.
[01:46:49.928 --> 01:46:53.212]  But when she takes her fish oil, she goes, Daddy, I feel so much better after I take it.
[01:46:53.232 --> 01:46:54.073]  I'm like, absolutely.
[01:46:54.093 --> 01:46:54.774]  So thank you, Jason.
[01:47:06.224 --> 01:47:09.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.892 --> 01:47:24.393]  Get ready for a rare retraction!
[01:47:29.247 --> 01:47:33.168]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:34.229 --> 01:47:38.770]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:39.070 --> 01:47:39.910]  And Robert Barnes.
[01:47:41.031 --> 01:47:47.012]  Beto O'Rourke has, in longer clips, said the world's ending in 11 years, AOC for 12 years.
[01:47:47.793 --> 01:47:52.754]  Al Gore said that all the sea level places, you know, he bought a house after that, would be gone by 2017.
[01:47:56.334 --> 01:47:57.915]  Listen to scientists on this and they're very clear.
[01:47:57.935 --> 01:48:01.636]  We don't have more than 10 years to get this right and we won't meet that challenge with half steps or half measures.
[01:48:26.223 --> 01:48:27.604]  You know, I think he was the biggest loser.
[01:48:27.824 --> 01:48:28.805]  He's unwatchable.
[01:48:28.845 --> 01:48:30.286]  He's so flaming fake.
[01:48:30.806 --> 01:48:35.810]  And the fact that all these fake Texans bought into him, it's just mental illness.
[01:48:36.010 --> 01:48:37.071]  Well, the betting markets agree.
[01:48:37.111 --> 01:48:40.473]  He took a 35% drop in what was already very low odds.
[01:48:40.873 --> 01:48:46.998]  I mean, he's now beneath Andrew Yang, way beneath Andrew Yang to be elected the next Democratic nominee for the presidency.
[01:48:47.378 --> 01:48:54.423]  So at this point, if he's smart, I mean, like, the meme about him was, uh, B2O Rourke still can't get the message, I mean, that, that he needs to get out.
[01:48:54.763 --> 01:48:58.365]  So I think the fact that he's even trying to, and that's why he's taking these extreme positions.
[01:48:58.665 --> 01:49:03.989]  He's like, okay, AOC said 12 years, I'll say no more than 10 years, maybe five years, maybe next time I'll say two years.
[01:49:04.449 --> 01:49:07.231]  Uh, something dramatic, something drastic, just to get attention.
[01:49:07.511 --> 01:49:08.732]  They're all really bad at it.
[01:49:08.972 --> 01:49:11.874]  None of them are have... He also said give illegal aliens everything for it.
[01:49:12.034 --> 01:49:12.494]  Oh, exactly.
[01:49:12.714 --> 01:49:16.217]  Free healthcare for illegal aliens, but not for American citizens.
[01:49:16.497 --> 01:49:18.198]  So the free education in the end.
[01:49:18.458 --> 01:49:20.459]  But he went back, he reversed himself last night.
[01:49:20.499 --> 01:49:23.241]  Originally they all said they wanted to decriminalize crossing the border.
[01:49:23.541 --> 01:49:27.144]  Then they did polls and they found out that even Democrats don't support that position.
[01:49:27.504 --> 01:49:32.047]  So Beto was reversing himself and saying, oh no, now I think we probably shouldn't decriminalize crossing the border.
[01:49:32.387 --> 01:49:34.628]  So he goes back and forth on those.
[01:49:34.648 --> 01:49:36.850]  But the real globalist agenda is opening the border.
[01:49:37.150 --> 01:49:37.490]  Absolutely.
[01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:45.193]  Marianne Williamson, if you go to DrugsReport.com, it's a powerful image right there of her saying that Trump is a dark force.
[01:49:46.194 --> 01:49:48.094]  Warns of dark days for Dems.
[01:49:48.195 --> 01:49:51.096]  Trump, psychic force in America.
[01:49:51.196 --> 01:49:52.356]  But she wanted to say dark force.
[01:49:52.816 --> 01:49:53.997]  Is it that projection?
[01:49:54.077 --> 01:49:55.478]  They're the ones that want pedophilia.
[01:49:55.878 --> 01:49:57.118]  They're the ones that want open borders.
[01:49:57.418 --> 01:49:59.859]  They're the ones that say America was never great, will never be great.
[01:50:00.139 --> 01:50:04.941]  They're the ones that are just pushing all this constant poison.
[01:50:05.322 --> 01:50:06.162]  Let's go ahead and hear from her.
[01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:07.100]  Ms.
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:09.941]  Williamson, what's your response on the Flint water crisis?
[01:50:10.061 --> 01:50:14.422]  My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg.
[01:50:14.882 --> 01:50:20.263]  I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina, where there is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint.
[01:50:20.743 --> 01:50:23.824]  We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act.
[01:50:24.224 --> 01:50:32.086]  We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country, who are suffering from environmental injustice.
[01:50:32.366 --> 01:50:33.866]  I assure you, I lived in Grosse Pointe.
[01:50:34.026 --> 01:50:36.407]  What happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe.
[01:50:36.727 --> 01:50:40.991]  This is part of the dark underbelly of American society.
[01:50:41.011 --> 01:50:45.215]  The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that we're having here tonight.
[01:50:45.456 --> 01:50:57.007]  If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I'm afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days.
[01:50:57.227 --> 01:50:58.467]  We need to say it like it is.
[01:50:58.708 --> 01:50:59.728]  It's bigger than Flint.
[01:50:59.968 --> 01:51:01.069]  It's all over this country.
[01:51:01.149 --> 01:51:02.489]  It's particularly people of color.
[01:51:02.529 --> 01:51:05.210]  It's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back.
[01:51:05.450 --> 01:51:09.652]  And if the Democrats don't start saying it, then why would those people feel that they're there for us?
[01:51:09.932 --> 01:51:15.294]  And if those people don't feel it, then... Why would anybody want to be this victim and say, I live in L.A.
[01:51:15.354 --> 01:51:24.498]  where it's toilet to tap, where they take the sewage, put it through all these expensive systems that the city bought, billions a year, folks, we're spending this in L.A., billions on the sewage.
[01:51:25.618 --> 01:51:31.724]  And then you drink toilet water filtered by the city, and then you wonder why everybody's got cancer.
[01:51:32.464 --> 01:51:34.286]  I mean, I've tasted L.A.
[01:51:34.346 --> 01:51:37.409]  water, and it literally makes me sick.
[01:51:38.009 --> 01:51:39.951]  When I go to L.A., I am a neat freak.
[01:51:40.071 --> 01:51:41.593]  I take three showers a day at least.
[01:51:42.412 --> 01:51:46.138]  Okay, I do not shower when I am in Los Angeles.
[01:51:46.178 --> 01:51:52.608]  I take bottles of filtered water and I take whore baths as they're called, okay?
[01:51:52.968 --> 01:51:57.135]  I take a whore bath with washcloths and that because I get sick and I'm tough.
[01:51:58.914 --> 01:52:01.295]  I get sick when I take a shower in L.A.
[01:52:01.755 --> 01:52:03.676]  I mean, the place is a joke, folks.
[01:52:03.976 --> 01:52:05.017]  Dallas is almost as bad.
[01:52:05.037 --> 01:52:05.697]  Houston's bad.
[01:52:05.957 --> 01:52:06.678]  I grew up in Dallas.
[01:52:07.278 --> 01:52:09.959]  I didn't need anybody to tell me tap water was bad when I was a kid playing football or whatever.
[01:52:10.159 --> 01:52:11.119]  I'd drink, like, three glasses of water.
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:11.940]  I'd feel sick after.
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:12.820]  Okay?
[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.041]  And I learned to start drinking filter water.
[01:52:14.061 --> 01:52:14.581]  I felt better.
[01:52:14.901 --> 01:52:16.102]  And yeah, I also sell water filters.
[01:52:16.122 --> 01:52:16.842]  The best that are out there.
[01:52:16.862 --> 01:52:17.282]  Damn right.
[01:52:17.582 --> 01:52:18.363]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:52:18.383 --> 01:52:22.865]  But what I'm getting at is, you know, one billion toilet-to-tap water program.
[01:52:22.885 --> 01:52:24.085]  I remember that years ago.
[01:52:24.285 --> 01:52:26.386]  But that's just some new... They got a whole bunch of sewage.
[01:52:26.566 --> 01:52:27.407]  That's just one facility.
[01:52:28.206 --> 01:52:30.828]  They already put it into old tap 20 years ago in some areas.
[01:52:31.608 --> 01:52:42.074]  And so, do you need the government to tell you you should filter your water or you should drink it out of something that is sewage with all the chemicals and all the runoff and all the drugs?
[01:52:42.334 --> 01:52:43.275]  That's insane!
[01:52:43.335 --> 01:52:44.755]  No filter can cut that out.
[01:52:44.996 --> 01:52:47.217]  And then the government adds toxic fluoride to it!
[01:52:47.967 --> 01:52:48.868]  I mean, well, there's no doubt.
[01:52:48.928 --> 01:52:50.508]  I mean, there's serious problems across the board.
[01:52:50.528 --> 01:52:54.010]  What's fascinating is, well, one, this use of the phrase people of color is ironic.
[01:52:54.210 --> 01:53:05.736]  It's like an old Bloomsbury comedic script where, you know, the older person keeps making references to colored people, which is a term we got rid of correctly, and now all of a sudden we're going back to it by just rephrasing it people of color.
[01:53:06.017 --> 01:53:07.698]  So that whole... And they're pushing busing!
[01:53:07.718 --> 01:53:08.558]  Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
[01:53:08.698 --> 01:53:12.680]  Oh, it was a complete political debacle, where Harris reversed her position off script.
[01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:14.821]  When she's on stage, she says one thing.
[01:53:14.841 --> 01:53:16.601]  When she's off stage, she says something completely different.
[01:53:16.822 --> 01:53:19.943]  She'll reverse herself eight different times, probably again tonight.
[01:53:20.543 --> 01:53:23.945]  But I think you saw with Williamson, there was a large degree of projection.
[01:53:24.265 --> 01:53:27.706]  The obsession with race is an obsession of the Democrats and the left.
[01:53:27.826 --> 01:53:29.407]  And they moved away from Russia for now.
[01:53:29.787 --> 01:53:30.587]  Exactly.
[01:53:30.827 --> 01:53:34.809]  It raises now the big mantra and it's purely moral virtue signaling.
[01:53:35.889 --> 01:53:41.511]  And new video service we'll have next segment, Elijah Cummings a decade ago on C-SPAN calling it rat infested.
[01:53:41.671 --> 01:53:58.677]  Oh I mean King Elijah of Baltimore as Trump called him is an accurate terminology and the reality is the Democratic Party has institutionally failed African-Americans in this country over 40, 50, 60 years and the question only is how do they keep inducing African-Americans to vote Democratic when the Democratic Party continues to fail the African-American
[01:53:58.717 --> 01:54:03.923]  The truth is, everybody I know, almost everybody that's black, just black, American, white, whatever, who cares?
[01:54:04.524 --> 01:54:05.545]  I'm sick of these damn terms.
[01:54:07.757 --> 01:54:09.238]  All of them don't like the Democrats.
[01:54:09.358 --> 01:54:15.201]  What they do is the Democrats are so corrupt, there's massive election fraud proven in inner city areas, whether it's poor white, black.
[01:54:15.521 --> 01:54:20.483]  We know that these are institutionalized criminal groups that are in control, that people aren't actually supporting it.
[01:54:20.524 --> 01:54:21.484]  The polls are all fake.
[01:54:21.604 --> 01:54:29.168]  Well, I mean, what was key to Trump's election was African American men in Detroit, in a light where the debates were held tonight and were held last night.
[01:54:29.768 --> 01:54:40.439]  If you look at where, same in Milwaukee, same in Philadelphia, same in Pittsburgh, it was because they voted for Trump in ways they did not vote for Romney and did not vote for McCain that gave Trump each of those three states.
[01:54:40.819 --> 01:54:48.887]  They know that and they think the appeal is to try to be like a bad rapper in their racializing of basic American politics.
[01:54:48.947 --> 01:54:52.851]  I've seen this, and I've got a family that's great, but some family
[01:54:53.928 --> 01:55:02.053]  When we're ordering Mexican food or something, Hispanics doing the serving will be like, hello, how you?
[01:55:02.133 --> 01:55:03.693]  They're like, what the hell are you talking about?
[01:55:04.194 --> 01:55:08.076]  And then I've seen it some around, we have a black cab driver or something, somebody will be like,
[01:55:09.653 --> 01:55:11.274]  Just like, literally virtue signaling.
[01:55:11.314 --> 01:55:14.996]  It's not that people are bad, they're just uncomfortable because the media has made it.
[01:55:15.096 --> 01:55:16.876]  I'm not going to talk different in front of somebody.
[01:55:17.117 --> 01:55:19.678]  I'm not going to go to New York City and talk with a Yankee accent.
[01:55:19.978 --> 01:55:21.779]  Much less they'd come down here and just be real.
[01:55:22.019 --> 01:55:22.439]  Oh, exactly.
[01:55:22.459 --> 01:55:23.660]  In fact, well, they've done studies on this.
[01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:28.322]  And so white liberals historically will use different words and because... They're three times more likely to have done their language down.
[01:55:28.562 --> 01:55:28.923]  Exactly.
[01:55:28.943 --> 01:55:30.004]  They're completely condescending.
[01:55:30.104 --> 01:55:31.506]  This is across the board.
[01:55:31.546 --> 01:55:34.510]  This is like my experience when I went to Yale in the 90s.
[01:55:34.750 --> 01:55:40.497]  You see people who think they're, really they're about supporting their own moral superiority to everyone else.
[01:55:40.577 --> 01:55:41.919]  Oh, here's an example.
[01:55:43.197 --> 01:55:56.507]  I had a lake house, this was like eight, nine years ago, and the neighbors were UT professors and they brought the gypsy king of the Roman people or whatever to the lake and they were so uncomfortable, so we shared a dock.
[01:55:57.207 --> 01:56:02.311]  They were like, we don't dislike gypsies, you know, like I didn't know those people were gypsies, they had brown skin, whatever, I'm over here fishing with my son.
[01:56:02.772 --> 01:56:09.316]  So she walks over to like my five-year-old son who has a birthmark, Rex is like 16 now, and she goes, she goes,
[01:56:10.217 --> 01:56:10.899]  What happened?
[01:56:10.999 --> 01:56:11.861]  Who hit you?
[01:56:11.962 --> 01:56:12.684]  Did he?
[01:56:12.704 --> 01:56:13.967]  Says this liberal white woman.
[01:56:14.568 --> 01:56:15.891]  And he goes, I've got a birthmark.
[01:56:15.912 --> 01:56:16.694]  She goes, oh sorry!
[01:56:16.854 --> 01:56:17.536]  They all knew I was Alex Jones.
[01:56:17.556 --> 01:56:19.340]  They were just flipping out!
[01:56:20.543 --> 01:56:27.588]  And then soon, the gypsies are over at my house asking for something, and then they're digging in my yard for arrowheads, and it's like, they are the royal people.
[01:56:27.648 --> 01:56:28.248]  You must let them.
[01:56:28.588 --> 01:56:32.170]  And at first, I've seen them, I just thought it was kind of rude and said, F off, they left me alone.
[01:56:32.611 --> 01:56:38.475]  But it was literally this thing like, here are the gypsies, you're racist, you beat your son, and it's just that it's like mind control.
[01:56:38.495 --> 01:56:39.855]  These people are nuts!
[01:56:39.895 --> 01:56:42.257]  What they want is they want people in their local communities.
[01:56:42.277 --> 01:56:44.598]  Well, these were professors that later on got ripped off by the gypsies.
[01:56:45.079 --> 01:56:47.841]  But they're in this cult like, I'm with the gypsies, oh God, they're so cool!
[01:56:48.061 --> 01:56:49.041]  Gypsies are so wonderful!
[01:56:49.462 --> 01:56:49.882]  You know, just...
[01:56:50.242 --> 01:56:53.965]  Well these are the people that when they drive through an inner city, lock their doors, or don't drive through the inner city at all.
[01:56:54.206 --> 01:56:55.927]  So these are people who are not connected or cared about.
[01:56:55.947 --> 01:56:56.908]  That's what Trump is exposing.
[01:56:57.028 --> 01:57:09.940]  He's like, here's someone who likes to grandstand, and the white media and the white left wants to grandstand, pretending they support racial equality, when it's Trump who's delivered the lowest unemployment rate for African American men in the history of the unemployment rate even being tracked.
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:13.643]  While you look at what's happening in their communities, they don't care about their communities.
[01:57:14.023 --> 01:57:16.626]  Instead, congressmen come and- They totally exploit it and want to keep them down.
[01:57:16.886 --> 01:57:21.270]  Exactly, and you see his wife is involved in dubious practices with an NGO, a non-governmental organization.
[01:57:21.291 --> 01:57:29.619]  Oh, and Trump knows all that, and now the media is defending rats, defending collapse, and it's insane how they're hypocrisy and duplicity on issues of race.
[01:57:29.639 --> 01:57:31.181]  They do not care about African Americans.
[01:57:31.201 --> 01:57:34.244]  They do not care about improving the ordinary, everyday lives of African Americans.
[01:57:34.264 --> 01:57:34.584]  I agree.
[01:57:34.624 --> 01:57:35.005]  Stay there.
[01:57:35.045 --> 01:57:37.827]  I'm going to play this Logic Cummings clip coming up, then hit a few other things.
[01:57:37.847 --> 01:57:39.870]  We have another guest coming on, but I've got so much to get to.
[01:57:41.522 --> 01:57:45.725]  I want to play my 26-month-old daughter singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
[01:57:45.765 --> 01:57:46.646]  She was singing it this morning.
[01:57:47.006 --> 01:57:47.847]  I got her to do it again.
[01:57:47.867 --> 01:57:48.728]  I'm gonna play that too.
[01:57:49.128 --> 01:57:49.929]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:52.971]  It's happening now.
[01:57:53.291 --> 01:57:54.012]  This is important.
[01:57:55.313 --> 01:57:56.494]  I'm 45 years old.
[01:57:57.635 --> 01:58:00.617]  When I was 35, I swam to two miles a day sometimes.
[01:58:01.258 --> 01:58:03.639]  And I would jog and couldn't lose weight.
[01:58:04.537 --> 01:58:07.079]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[01:58:07.279 --> 01:58:11.883]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[01:58:12.544 --> 01:58:17.708]  I knew all about the private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, and the pedophile rings.
[01:58:18.029 --> 01:58:22.973]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the shycoms in.
[01:58:23.173 --> 01:58:24.915]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[01:58:25.615 --> 01:58:26.916]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[01:58:28.077 --> 01:58:29.438]  I didn't know about all this.
[01:58:30.219 --> 01:58:31.881]  And I didn't know about clean iodine.
[01:58:32.978 --> 01:58:34.539]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:43.905]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and that experience that I'm not BSing you.
[01:58:44.706 --> 01:58:50.789]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[01:58:50.809 --> 01:58:52.310]  Let me tell you something right now.
[01:58:53.651 --> 01:58:54.432]  You see DNA Force?
[01:58:55.549 --> 01:59:08.832]  I went out to top manufacturers that are the most respected, most highly tested, and I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[01:59:09.792 --> 01:59:12.293]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each model.
[01:59:12.793 --> 01:59:15.474]  I said, I want to put $50 a model in it.
[01:59:15.514 --> 01:59:16.594]  They said, nobody's ever done that.
[01:59:17.213 --> 01:59:19.894]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was gonna buy.
[01:59:20.154 --> 01:59:23.415]  I got it down to thirty-something dollars a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[01:59:24.095 --> 01:59:25.115]  Nobody does that!
[01:59:25.996 --> 01:59:32.277]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this, and you research every ingredient in this, and then you experience it for yourself.
[01:59:33.138 --> 01:59:33.838]  It's incredible.
[01:59:35.797 --> 01:59:46.682]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[01:59:47.142 --> 01:59:49.704]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:59:54.786 --> 02:00:00.689]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:11.138 --> 02:00:13.459]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, historian, smart fella.
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:18.522]  Um, let me ask you a question.
[02:00:19.122 --> 02:00:20.463]  Look at him, obsessed with a smartphone.
[02:00:20.483 --> 02:00:23.144]  He's over there sending a tweet out right now while we're live on air.
[02:00:23.644 --> 02:00:29.327]  Trying to send it to the forecasting, the forecasting one from about 10 days ago.
[02:00:30.151 --> 02:00:30.451]  That's right.
[02:00:53.726 --> 02:00:56.830]  Political gambler, who even the New York Times admits you are.
[02:00:57.430 --> 02:01:00.814]  Maybe you aren't because they say you are, but the point is, they're such liars, but you are.
[02:01:01.535 --> 02:01:04.258]  And show how you guys actually did this.
[02:01:04.318 --> 02:01:09.203]  Watch the top political sports gambler predict the last two debates perfectly.
[02:01:09.584 --> 02:01:10.825]  I mean, that's the headline.
[02:01:10.865 --> 02:01:11.666]  That's pretty powerful.
[02:01:11.826 --> 02:01:20.793]  Oh yeah, and it shows the value of, if you're good at what you do, and you're giving honest, objective analysis, and you're really aware of what's happening in the country, then you should be able to forecast these things.
[02:01:20.813 --> 02:01:24.295]  Doesn't mean you'll always be accurate, but you should be above average in your accuracy.
[02:01:24.335 --> 02:01:25.516]  Sure, but I see your own frustration.
[02:01:25.536 --> 02:01:26.277]  The crew's awesome.
[02:01:26.737 --> 02:01:34.003]  It's just hard for them with all your tweets to pull it up, so you're like tweeting them into the next room, hoping, there it is, betting markets current forecast.
[02:01:34.483 --> 02:01:35.224]  Then it just goes back.
[02:01:35.404 --> 02:01:38.549]  So let's not do this half-assed, or cattywampus, or half-cocked.
[02:01:38.969 --> 02:01:43.135]  I want you to meet with whoever you want, got a great crew in there, and we'll go back to Owen's prediction.
[02:01:43.175 --> 02:01:50.725]  I remember Owen's prediction the day of the last debates, with you on air, and what he thought would come out of it, and it was exactly what he said.
[02:01:50.865 --> 02:01:57.006]  Yep, and last night when we were on here, we said Marianne Williamson would be the most searched candidate very early on in the debates, and that's precisely what happened.
[02:01:57.246 --> 02:01:59.147]  Most searched in 49 out of 50 states.
[02:01:59.707 --> 02:02:01.187]  And she won the drudge poll?
[02:02:01.487 --> 02:02:03.467]  With ease, almost half of the vote.
[02:02:03.727 --> 02:02:07.228]  So, we'll just get those pieces together, and we'll put them out as a report.
[02:02:07.268 --> 02:02:07.948]  That's important!
[02:02:07.988 --> 02:02:08.268]  Wow!
[02:02:09.168 --> 02:02:11.809]  Our pundits are like 100% dead on.
[02:02:12.069 --> 02:02:12.849]  Who's got that?
[02:02:12.909 --> 02:02:14.009]  That's bragging rights, baby!
[02:02:14.289 --> 02:02:16.650]  Meanwhile, the entire corporate media said Trump was going to lose by 15 points.
[02:02:17.210 --> 02:02:17.490]  Exactly.
[02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:18.372]  Because they had fake polls out.
[02:02:18.572 --> 02:02:19.633]  Who did I tell you was going to win?
[02:02:19.913 --> 02:02:22.156]  Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.
[02:02:22.256 --> 02:02:34.150]  CNN had this completely bogus focus group last night where they had these people on there that were just repeating CNN talking points that were completely inconsistent and contradicted by the Google searches, by other polls that were taking place, by the Drudge poll, by other items.
[02:02:34.290 --> 02:02:36.273]  How long could this Emperor's New Clothes thing go on?
[02:02:36.852 --> 02:02:38.153]  I think, I mean, that's a good question.
[02:02:38.173 --> 02:02:42.415]  I mean, you're getting to the point where institutional media just continues to decline in their respect and credibility.
[02:02:42.495 --> 02:02:47.298]  Other than the white left, that's the only party, that's the only group most African American Democrats don't trust.
[02:02:47.318 --> 02:02:48.519]  But as Politico pointed out...
[02:02:49.062 --> 02:02:52.483]  Trump reads newspapers and watches mainstream, he still believes it.
[02:02:52.963 --> 02:02:53.683]  Yeah, to a certain degree.
[02:02:53.723 --> 02:02:56.284]  I mean, I think if there's a limitation, Trump needs to continue.
[02:02:56.304 --> 02:03:00.825]  What he did really good in the build-up to 2016 was he completely ignored the establishment press.
[02:03:01.145 --> 02:03:05.366]  What he watched was Infowars, what he watched was he listened to talk radio, he went to the Independent Media.
[02:03:05.386 --> 02:03:11.227]  No, I mean, he did do that then because it was all so negative, but I don't know why he's so obsessed with the lies they're telling about him.
[02:03:11.247 --> 02:03:15.108]  I mean, I know he likes to see what they're doing to then counteract them and manipulate them.
[02:03:15.368 --> 02:03:16.749]  That's all a great show for us.
[02:03:17.529 --> 02:03:19.730]  But I hope that he's only doing it for the political show.
[02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:21.111]  I hope he doesn't think they have power.
[02:03:21.371 --> 02:03:22.571]  Because he's giving them power.
[02:03:22.671 --> 02:03:26.133]  And their narrative is, I mean like he gets frustrated when Fox goes off script.
[02:03:26.173 --> 02:03:30.795]  What he should pay attention to is what is driving the national narrative is not establishment institutional press.
[02:03:31.175 --> 02:03:32.415]  They're reacting to the national narrative.
[02:03:32.435 --> 02:03:35.517]  Everything we cover one week or Drudge covers one week, they cover the next.
[02:03:35.737 --> 02:03:36.077]  Exactly.
[02:03:36.237 --> 02:03:38.039]  So he needs to stop letting the tail wag the dog.
[02:03:38.139 --> 02:03:38.559]  Completely.
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:52.833]  And if he wants to be ahead of the curve like he was in 2015 and 2016 against every other Republican presidential candidate because he was watching Infowars, there's a reason why the Infowars audience and Trump's early base completely overlap politically in the polling that we've done.
[02:03:53.314 --> 02:03:58.159]  And that is because he listened to the populist message, he followed the populist message.
[02:03:58.179 --> 02:04:00.241]  Just like he did when he owns buildings, he goes and knocks on doors.
[02:04:00.501 --> 02:04:00.881]  Exactly.
[02:04:00.941 --> 02:04:03.924]  He did real marketing, real understanding of who his audience is.
[02:04:04.264 --> 02:04:10.268]  The New York Times is not his audience, and increasingly nobody who is part of his audience listens or cares about what the New York Times says.
[02:04:10.288 --> 02:04:11.609]  And they're in their own desperate echo chamber.
[02:04:11.809 --> 02:04:12.550]  Completely.
[02:04:12.670 --> 02:04:14.411]  And you're seeing that in the debates live.
[02:04:14.431 --> 02:04:20.016]  You'll see it again tonight, where they are so siloed from the rest of the world and their understanding of what ordinary people want.
[02:04:20.296 --> 02:04:21.216]  I mean, take their own audience.
[02:04:21.236 --> 02:04:22.057]  Take reparations.
[02:04:22.597 --> 02:04:26.821]  The Democrats themselves, when they polled reparations, said we're not interested in reparations.
[02:04:27.461 --> 02:04:28.642]  It was a very low number.
[02:04:28.782 --> 02:04:29.022]  Ten.
[02:04:29.242 --> 02:04:37.346]  And across the board, even MSNBC's Steve Kornacki last night was saying, by the way, everything they're talking about is extremely unpopular, including within the Democratic Party.
[02:04:37.466 --> 02:04:39.567]  I know, even CNN said, by the way, this is very unpopular.
[02:04:39.767 --> 02:04:40.107]  Exactly.
[02:04:40.267 --> 02:04:41.428]  David Axelrod was admitting that.
[02:04:41.468 --> 02:04:42.228]  He was telling us it was unpopular.
[02:04:42.248 --> 02:04:43.749]  But see, they're trying to bend our will.
[02:04:43.969 --> 02:04:44.310]  Exactly.
[02:04:44.330 --> 02:04:46.210]  So everything is, they're like, we know it's unpopular.
[02:04:46.471 --> 02:04:49.132]  Gillette lost five billion telling us our dads suck.
[02:04:49.512 --> 02:04:51.473]  No, our dads were pretty frickin' cool, man.
[02:04:51.893 --> 02:04:52.894]  Even when they beat our ass.
[02:04:54.515 --> 02:04:58.718]  It's a complete disconnect that they're in, and they're trying to create a fake world that doesn't reflect the real world.
[02:04:59.099 --> 02:05:01.220]  And that's why they get elections wrong, and that's why they get predictions wrong.
[02:05:01.261 --> 02:05:01.661]  We'll be back.
[02:05:01.681 --> 02:05:02.121]  Stay with us.

[02:06:14.741 --> 02:06:21.261]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:25.212 --> 02:06:26.973]  Chuck, I'm kind of thirsty, I'll be honest with you.
[02:06:27.254 --> 02:06:28.755]  I've been out there on the streets all day.
[02:06:29.335 --> 02:06:34.861]  You know, if you feel like maybe giving your immune system a charge, a nice good tap, we'll do the trick.
[02:06:34.901 --> 02:06:37.263]  And I know how to make tap straight fresh.
[02:06:37.323 --> 02:06:38.524]  You can make fresh tap?
[02:06:39.445 --> 02:06:40.426]  Totally from scratch.
[02:06:40.586 --> 02:06:44.509]  What I like to start off with is a little bit of gun powder.
[02:06:44.630 --> 02:06:47.732]  Now Charles, are you being serious that this is how municipal tap water is made?
[02:06:47.873 --> 02:06:48.073]  Oh yeah.
[02:06:48.613 --> 02:06:55.817]  If you ever go to, uh, what is it, Flint, Michigan or something, you can have sulfur water, things lightin' on fire, you got egg water, you got all different kinds of stuff.
[02:06:56.157 --> 02:06:59.539]  So, you know, people are really used to this flavor, and you know what else they're used to?
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:06.103]  They're used to takin' it in the a**, as in, they pay taxes, and they get that water, and they do nothing about it.
[02:07:06.143 --> 02:07:11.806]  They might scream a little bit and say, oh, our water's bad, but they end up not doing very much, so, it doesn't really matter, so.
[02:07:12.927 --> 02:07:19.069]  I like to emulate that sort of, uh, that sentiment of paying taxes, paying really high taxes and getting nothing in return.
[02:07:19.089 --> 02:07:20.589]  Not even clean water.
[02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:22.810]  See, it's got tissues in it.
[02:07:23.630 --> 02:07:24.571]  Half shower, half bowl.
[02:07:24.591 --> 02:07:28.832]  A little bit of toilet water.
[02:07:29.432 --> 02:07:30.413]  It's f***ing not so bad.
[02:07:30.433 --> 02:07:31.493]  It's not as bad as people think.
[02:07:33.534 --> 02:07:34.414]  The creamy paste.
[02:07:36.415 --> 02:07:37.555]  Now, it's not ready.
[02:07:38.375 --> 02:07:39.075]  This is not ready.
[02:07:39.396 --> 02:07:40.636]  You want to give it a little bit of, like,
[02:07:42.045 --> 02:07:42.686]  Showmanship.
[02:07:42.846 --> 02:07:44.627]  Showmanship, yeah, and a little bit more spice.
[02:07:44.987 --> 02:07:47.649]  Sometimes I'm feeling, like, really angry.
[02:07:47.669 --> 02:08:05.364]  Like, I don't know if it's a testosterone thing, but the problem with anger is that an angry population of people, when their government doesn't even provide them with clean water or even, like, fix the streets' potholes, you know, when the taxes get like that, people with a lot of anger or testosterone usually flip cars over and sometimes even kill politicians.
[02:08:06.574 --> 02:08:07.054]  I hate that.
[02:08:07.254 --> 02:08:07.895]  You can't have that.
[02:08:08.195 --> 02:08:11.596]  So, I usually put birth control in every concoction I make.
[02:08:11.836 --> 02:08:15.658]  It's gone from a tap wire to a martini now, so we're really just enjoying it.
[02:08:15.978 --> 02:08:25.121]  But the original recipe, still just as... Guys, this stuff came out so thick.
[02:08:26.702 --> 02:08:28.142]  I was gonna spice yours up a little.
[02:08:30.443 --> 02:08:31.484]  Did you like it a lot?
[02:08:32.369 --> 02:08:34.634]  Hey guys, thanks for enjoying this tap water.
[02:08:34.854 --> 02:08:35.576]  We should all taste it.
[02:08:35.656 --> 02:08:36.217]  Here's to life.
[02:08:36.438 --> 02:08:37.059]  Here's to you guys.
[02:08:38.422 --> 02:08:39.084]  This is monster.
[02:08:39.104 --> 02:08:43.052]  This one's monster.
[02:08:45.066 --> 02:08:45.226]  Ms.
[02:08:45.266 --> 02:08:48.068]  Williamson, what's your response on the Flint water crisis?
[02:08:48.188 --> 02:08:52.531]  My response on the Flint water crisis is that Flint is just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:08:53.012 --> 02:08:58.395]  I was recently in Denmark, South Carolina, where there is a lot of talk about it being the next Flint.
[02:08:58.876 --> 02:09:01.978]  We have an administration that has gutted the Clean Water Act.
[02:09:02.358 --> 02:09:10.224]  We have communities, particularly communities of color and disadvantaged communities all over this country, who are suffering from environmental injustice.
[02:09:10.504 --> 02:09:12.005]  I assure you, I lived in Grosse Pointe.
[02:09:12.165 --> 02:09:14.567]  What happened in Flint would not have happened in Grosse Pointe.
[02:09:14.847 --> 02:09:18.912]  This is part of the dark underbelly of American society.
[02:09:18.952 --> 02:09:23.337]  The racism, the bigotry, and the entire conversation that we're having here tonight.
[02:09:23.597 --> 02:09:35.130]  If you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country, then I'm afraid that the Democrats are going to see some very dark days.
[02:09:35.370 --> 02:09:36.591]  We need to say it like it is.
[02:09:36.831 --> 02:09:37.851]  It's bigger than Flint.
[02:09:38.091 --> 02:09:39.212]  It's all over this country.
[02:09:39.272 --> 02:09:40.592]  It's particularly people of color.
[02:09:40.652 --> 02:09:43.293]  It's particularly people who do not have the money to fight back.
[02:09:43.553 --> 02:09:47.735]  And if the Democrats don't start saying it, then why would those people feel that they're there for us?
[02:09:48.015 --> 02:09:49.796]  And if those people don't feel it, they won't vote for us.
[02:09:50.496 --> 02:09:57.479]  And Donald Trump will win.
[02:09:57.559 --> 02:09:59.320]  I was stummin' from Montgomery.
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:01.181]  Guitar on my body.
[02:10:04.552 --> 02:10:17.902]  You know, I talk faster and faster when Barnes is on, because everything he's saying I'm agreeing with, and there's just more, more, more, more, more.
[02:10:17.962 --> 02:10:23.966]  I've only scratched the surface of getting ready for this show since 5.30 a.m.
[02:10:24.026 --> 02:10:24.867]  this morning!
[02:10:25.827 --> 02:10:27.488]  And I couldn't turn away from the show last night.
[02:10:28.589 --> 02:10:29.570]  I couldn't host it, though.
[02:10:29.710 --> 02:10:31.351]  You know, so it's okay.
[02:10:31.431 --> 02:10:31.772]  I'm the boss.
[02:10:32.751 --> 02:10:34.112]  I walked out of here at about 9.45.
[02:10:34.292 --> 02:10:36.133]  I just said, I cannot look at these people.
[02:10:37.934 --> 02:10:41.176]  And Barnes and Owen, everybody's like, we're cool, we can take over.
[02:10:42.056 --> 02:10:44.878]  And I listened as I drove home, and I listened to the end last night.
[02:10:45.518 --> 02:10:48.720]  When the next host came on, did a great job, I listened like midnight.
[02:10:50.081 --> 02:10:53.203]  I can listen to them, but I can't look at them.
[02:10:53.343 --> 02:10:56.925]  Do you ever have that feeling looking at these plastic, fake weirdos?
[02:10:56.965 --> 02:10:59.687]  It's like, there's something about looking at them, like Hillary.
[02:11:01.061 --> 02:11:05.041]  I mean, I've gotten for years where I physically get upset just looking at her.
[02:11:05.455 --> 02:11:17.200]  Well yeah, I mean I think that to a certain degree they're sort of artificial in their artificiality and their hypocrisy comes through in their physical presentation in ways that the verbal is more manageable because you just hear the idea.
[02:11:17.540 --> 02:11:23.442]  You don't see the duplicity that's evident in their physical manifestation of their visual presence.
[02:11:23.842 --> 02:11:25.023]  And I think that's what takes place.
[02:11:25.423 --> 02:11:27.324]  And I think there's aspects of that.
[02:11:27.344 --> 02:11:32.486]  Because last night I started hating myself and everyone around me and I was honest to the head producer.
[02:11:32.506 --> 02:11:33.506]  I said, I gotta go.
[02:11:33.526 --> 02:11:35.147]  I never get depressed except looking at them.
[02:11:35.447 --> 02:11:39.791]  Well, because there's such evident fakeness manifested in the way they interact with the interface.
[02:11:39.811 --> 02:11:40.292]  And they're the internet.
[02:11:40.412 --> 02:11:41.233]  They are very much so.
[02:11:41.533 --> 02:11:50.642]  And the degree to which they are disconnected from ordinary reality in the sort of siloed fantasy that they want to bring people into in the democratic debate.
[02:11:51.002 --> 02:11:55.308]  Where they think normal is promoting health care for illegal aliens.
[02:11:55.329 --> 02:11:59.254]  Where they think normal is reparations that make no sense.
[02:11:59.294 --> 02:11:59.995]  Who's gonna pay?
[02:12:00.015 --> 02:12:05.724]  I mean, does my family get a benefit because my family was... And every study and actuary, it'll bankrupt us instantly!
[02:12:06.364 --> 02:12:08.385]  This is like firing torpedoes into a ship.
[02:12:08.545 --> 02:12:09.885]  It's completely unmanageable.
[02:12:09.965 --> 02:12:15.267]  I mean, in a world of true reparations, the people that should be paying include Kamala Harris and Barack Obama.
[02:12:15.307 --> 02:12:18.568]  Her family, one of the most powerful slave-owning groups in Jamaica.
[02:12:18.788 --> 02:12:19.228]  Exactly.
[02:12:19.448 --> 02:12:22.949]  Barack Obama, who's... Ilhan Omar comes from an elite slaver family.
[02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:28.190]  Oh, in fact, indeed, the Islamic world is where slavery originated and continued long past.
[02:12:28.391 --> 02:12:33.232]  It was us in America leading the West and leading the world in ending slavery.
[02:12:33.272 --> 02:12:35.072]  We didn't start slavery, we ended it.
[02:12:35.933 --> 02:12:37.033]  We led the world in ending it.
[02:12:37.333 --> 02:12:38.853]  So it doesn't even make sense.
[02:12:38.914 --> 02:12:41.994]  And do African immigrants not be included?
[02:12:42.014 --> 02:12:45.075]  Do tribes have claims against one another?
[02:12:45.135 --> 02:12:50.277]  Because some tribes in Native America... But again, in law, if my father, which he didn't, was a bank robber,
[02:12:51.417 --> 02:12:55.439]  I'm not in trouble that he went to jail for 10 years for that, which my dad didn't, but hypothetically.
[02:12:55.759 --> 02:13:01.441]  So this idea only in Soviet or Nazi authoritarian systems is your neighbor does something wrong, you get in trouble, too.
[02:13:01.641 --> 02:13:09.924]  Well, knowing that, we do have a history of blood libel, and it led to the biggest purge and attacks of anti-Semitism and racial hatred in the world.
[02:13:09.944 --> 02:13:12.605]  That's like they say, oh, this Jew did this 100 years ago.
[02:13:12.645 --> 02:13:13.566]  Oh, exactly.
[02:13:13.686 --> 02:13:14.286]  Or 2,000 years ago.
[02:13:14.306 --> 02:13:15.466]  That's right.
[02:13:15.546 --> 02:13:16.547]  You killed Christ.
[02:13:16.847 --> 02:13:17.207]  Exactly.
[02:13:17.507 --> 02:13:18.988]  Oh, that's the first reparations.
[02:13:19.708 --> 02:13:22.510]  Oh my God, you kill Christ, we're going to kill you a thousand years later.
[02:13:22.590 --> 02:13:23.051]  Precisely.
[02:13:23.091 --> 02:13:40.243]  The first reparations led to the worst onslaught, ultimately... That's right, all the pogroms in Spain and Portugal... All the purges, all of the kicking out and isolation and segregation of Jews in Russia, all the pogroms that took place, all of this, I mean, the Israel was created... Because you killed Jesus.
[02:13:40.723 --> 02:13:40.943]  Exactly.
[02:13:40.983 --> 02:13:42.445]  No, but they didn't kill Jesus.
[02:13:42.605 --> 02:13:43.906]  No, nothing to do with it.
[02:13:44.126 --> 02:13:49.091]  So, I mean, that's what makes it, we understand blood libels are dangerous, blood libels are harmful.
[02:13:49.111 --> 02:13:52.594]  But then that also made a lot of the Jews become leftists and then hate Christians.
[02:13:53.015 --> 02:13:57.459]  So just like saying whites are all racist and need reparations, it'll make a lot of whites become racist.
[02:13:57.915 --> 02:14:00.896]  Well, inevitably, because they're asking people.
[02:14:01.136 --> 02:14:05.818]  White identity politics is a reaction to left-wing identity politics.
[02:14:05.878 --> 02:14:08.459]  They simply reincorporate the same language.
[02:14:08.499 --> 02:14:17.522]  So racists like Richard Spencer propagate basically leftist politics at the behest and behalf of the leftists by just incorporating their terms into a different racial phraseology.
[02:14:17.542 --> 02:14:18.683]  And by the way, our great crew
[02:14:19.645 --> 02:14:25.069]  Has been working a lot of them 15, 16 hours straight because we have a limited crew to this 40-hour broadcast and I love them to death.
[02:14:25.429 --> 02:14:26.590]  So I'm not cracking the whip.
[02:14:26.610 --> 02:14:30.593]  When I said don't go off half-cocked, it's because it was so powerful, Barnes.
[02:14:30.994 --> 02:14:35.637]  I already had respect for it, but it went way up when I started tracking your betting history and your predictions.
[02:14:36.458 --> 02:14:38.399]  But I watched you guys, you and Owen a month ago.
[02:14:38.579 --> 02:14:41.001]  Owen exactly predicted the top Google search.
[02:14:41.041 --> 02:14:42.402]  He exactly predicted who would win.
[02:14:42.422 --> 02:14:43.783]  He exactly predicted who would win the poll.
[02:14:43.883 --> 02:14:45.845]  And you did as well, and you did it again last night.
[02:14:46.365 --> 02:14:59.236]  And you're trying to send out your tweets and show folks we need to get the crew together and get those videos from a month ago and last night and show people how you guys nailed it because that is a major talking point for our coverage of news that you knocked that freaking thing out of the park grand slam baby.
[02:14:59.456 --> 02:15:10.386]  Oh exactly and I think what it shows is it shows we are far more on top of what's happening in the world how people think and how people react than this sort of fake artificial fantasy land that I mean the... And you know in their lawsuits against me they keep
[02:15:10.826 --> 02:15:12.267]  Who's the secret group?
[02:15:12.687 --> 02:15:14.128]  What's the agency telling you what to do?
[02:15:14.188 --> 02:15:16.069]  It's called not being a slave.
[02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:17.851]  It's called doing our own thinking.
[02:15:18.011 --> 02:15:19.472]  The more you do it, the better you get at it.
[02:15:19.752 --> 02:15:21.373]  Never having anyone tell me what to do every day.
[02:15:21.613 --> 02:15:22.553]  I've made a lot of mistakes.
[02:15:22.974 --> 02:15:23.574]  You get better.
[02:15:23.914 --> 02:15:24.435]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:15:24.675 --> 02:15:25.575]  And it's just being independent.
[02:15:25.595 --> 02:15:30.658]  It's having an audience that allows this independence to thrive and survive by supporting InfoWars.
[02:15:30.919 --> 02:15:34.721]  All they've got to do is just go and find the product they like, find the idea they like, support it.
[02:15:34.961 --> 02:15:39.784]  And they are the ones that are changing the world by allowing and authorizing us to have the skills to do that.
[02:15:39.824 --> 02:15:42.626]  The sun growing plants, or water, or soil.
[02:15:42.966 --> 02:15:45.648]  Listeners, you're not just part of it, you're the entire biosphere.
[02:15:45.828 --> 02:15:46.509]  They are the sun.
[02:15:46.909 --> 02:15:47.469]  They are the sun.
[02:15:47.510 --> 02:15:50.652]  Store-wide free shipping, double paid for your points, 50% or more off.
[02:15:50.952 --> 02:15:56.996]  Infowarsstore.com, we're doing a major fundraiser because we don't want to just sit here, we want to expand in the face of the enemy.
[02:15:57.357 --> 02:15:58.477]  But it is in your hands!
[02:15:58.577 --> 02:16:00.419]  Infowarsstore.com, take action!
[02:16:02.998 --> 02:16:13.987]  There is a stated planetary plan set out by the Fortune 100 corporations and the megabanks to outlaw the existence of nation-states.
[02:16:14.467 --> 02:16:24.856]  A year and a half ago, when they were trying to take down Confederate statues around the country, I warned people, next it would be Thomas Jefferson, the writer of the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution.
[02:16:25.577 --> 02:16:30.441]  Sure enough, they want his statues taken down, even though he pushed to end slavery himself.
[02:16:31.488 --> 02:16:39.932]  And now, Colin Kaepernick didn't like the Betsy Ross flag saying it was for slavery, even though she was an abolitionist.
[02:16:39.952 --> 02:16:46.094]  That means, again, someone who pushed the outlawing of slavery that England started worldwide.
[02:16:46.355 --> 02:16:51.197]  But the West gets the blame for slavery still being carried out by Muslims in at least four countries.
[02:16:51.697 --> 02:16:53.017]  But again, facts don't matter.
[02:16:53.458 --> 02:16:58.500]  And now, not just the University of Colorado State, but other universities
[02:16:59.813 --> 02:17:04.115]  Are saying, don't say Americans, America, or policeman.
[02:17:06.197 --> 02:17:09.979]  This is the mind control these individuals are engaged in.
[02:17:10.699 --> 02:17:12.560]  Now, they know exactly what they're doing.
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:14.341]  This is psychological warfare.
[02:17:14.981 --> 02:17:22.606]  I had the idea on the 4th of July, when we launched it, when Kaepernick was demonizing the Betsy Ross flag, our first flag.
[02:17:24.006 --> 02:17:28.349]  To say, hey, let's just put out t-shirts that have the Betsy Ross flag on it saying, these colors don't rhyme.
[02:17:29.850 --> 02:17:31.772]  It's the best-selling shirt we've ever had.
[02:17:32.152 --> 02:17:35.916]  It's already starting to surpass Hillary for prison, which of course we started as well.
[02:17:36.396 --> 02:17:41.721]  Limbaugh, a few days after I did, had the same idea, because it's just common sense, and put out his own Betsy Ross flag.
[02:17:42.842 --> 02:17:54.393]  And I was watching him on Fox, and he really made the best points and encapsulated what I've been trying to say, that we're so sick of being demonized, we're so sick of everything that's Americana being called racist or evil, that the American flag's too far.
[02:17:55.307 --> 02:18:08.973]  And that's why people are responding everywhere, flying not just the classic American flag we all know of today, but the original American flag back in their face and saying, no, you cult, control freak, bully monsters.
[02:18:10.137 --> 02:18:14.458]  We're going to be proud of our country, and we're going to stand up and speak out against you.
[02:18:15.118 --> 02:18:17.439]  They call that censorship, by the way, when we disagree with them.
[02:18:17.779 --> 02:18:19.679]  The left's the ones trying to get rid of the First Amendment.
[02:18:20.219 --> 02:18:21.620]  If anybody's fascist, it's them.
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.120]  And so we had a limited edition Betsy Ross flag.
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:24.741]  It sold out.
[02:18:25.241 --> 02:18:30.722]  We've got four new variants that are the next limited edition that are very similar to the last two.
[02:18:32.022 --> 02:18:34.383]  I think we've been upgraded the font, changed some of the colors.
[02:18:35.103 --> 02:18:35.683]  They're powerful.
[02:18:36.023 --> 02:18:43.285]  And then we also have a new one that's the American flag with the Gadsden snake that says, don't tread on me.
[02:18:43.325 --> 02:18:44.506]  It just goes perfectly together.
[02:18:45.086 --> 02:18:45.706]  A double meaning.
[02:18:46.246 --> 02:18:49.607]  And on the back it says, America's back, which is very triggering to leftists.
[02:18:50.147 --> 02:18:51.068]  Infowars.com.
[02:18:51.608 --> 02:18:52.468]  And this is a win-win.
[02:18:52.488 --> 02:19:01.110]  You get to support the American flag, stand up for free speech, let the globalists and their minions know that we outnumber them and we're not going to submit to their tyranny and their oppression.
[02:19:01.290 --> 02:19:02.471]  We're not going to take our colors down.
[02:19:03.351 --> 02:19:04.612]  And let them know that they've conquered us.
[02:19:04.632 --> 02:19:06.634]  It's the last thing you do when you conquer somebody is take their flag down.
[02:19:06.934 --> 02:19:08.195]  It's incredible humiliation.
[02:19:08.796 --> 02:19:12.820]  And it funds this operation that's under globalist attack.
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:14.261]  And they're trying to shut us down.
[02:19:14.361 --> 02:19:17.424]  So InfoWars existing is an act of defiance against their evil.
[02:19:17.864 --> 02:19:19.465]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:20.206 --> 02:19:25.431]  We have the Don't Tread on the American Flag in Betsy Ross and in the modern flag.
[02:19:26.701 --> 02:19:34.624]  And then we also have the two new variants as well of the Betsy Ross flag at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:19:34.644 --> 02:19:36.665]  So very, very excited about these shirts.
[02:19:37.285 --> 02:19:38.785]  I'm already seeing people out there wearing them.
[02:19:38.825 --> 02:19:39.986]  They've got five-star reviews.
[02:19:40.246 --> 02:19:43.887]  They're available at InfoWarsTore.com and your purchase funds the operation.
[02:19:43.927 --> 02:19:44.648]  A true 360 win.
[02:19:45.828 --> 02:19:46.849]  They're trying to remove the flag?
[02:19:46.969 --> 02:19:50.652]  We bring it back in their face and we fund the InfoWar at the same time.
[02:19:50.953 --> 02:19:52.834]  A true 360 win.
[02:19:52.935 --> 02:19:53.555]  Get your shirts.
[02:19:53.855 --> 02:19:54.656]  Give them as gifts.
[02:19:55.016 --> 02:19:55.997]  Give them to your grandchildren.
[02:19:56.037 --> 02:19:56.698]  Give them to your husband.
[02:19:56.718 --> 02:19:57.279]  Give them to your wife.
[02:19:57.479 --> 02:19:58.480]  Give them to your co-workers.
[02:19:59.260 --> 02:20:02.423]  And fund the InfoWar while you get great shirts as well.
[02:20:06.307 --> 02:20:08.929]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.238 --> 02:20:28.106]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:20:28.887 --> 02:20:30.748]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:31.109 --> 02:20:33.531]  And again, we're not trying to obsess over Infowars.
[02:20:33.591 --> 02:20:35.472]  The enemy is obsessing over us.
[02:20:36.513 --> 02:20:37.214]  There I was.
[02:20:38.516 --> 02:20:43.180]  Last night while I was listening to the coverage of Clown World during the debate we'll be covering tonight with Biden and all the rest of it.
[02:20:43.200 --> 02:20:47.543]  I'll be here as well, but I left halfway through it because I was just, I couldn't handle it.
[02:20:47.563 --> 02:20:48.924]  I mean, I'll be honest, I couldn't look at him anymore.
[02:20:49.925 --> 02:20:51.206]  It was so horrible I couldn't watch it.
[02:20:51.226 --> 02:20:52.607]  So please tune in, it's so horrible.
[02:20:52.987 --> 02:20:54.088]  No, but we've got to analyze it.
[02:20:54.108 --> 02:20:54.889]  We've got to expose them.
[02:20:54.909 --> 02:20:55.549]  They want us to give up.
[02:20:55.569 --> 02:20:56.790]  You know, that's part of it.
[02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:57.831]  But the crew will be here.
[02:20:57.851 --> 02:20:58.512]  I'll be here as well.
[02:20:58.532 --> 02:21:01.354]  But so I said, let me go to Bing, which Microsoft owns.
[02:21:01.414 --> 02:21:03.416]  It's still censored, but it's nothing like Google.
[02:21:04.605 --> 02:21:13.892]  There was hundreds of articles I hadn't seen, because I had been getting Google alerts on my name, and I thought, you know, it's so censored, I bet I'm not getting articles, except, you know, the ones they want people to see on Google.
[02:21:14.312 --> 02:21:21.757]  Sure enough, GQ, New York Times, hundreds of articles, literally, that I saw, I probably read 20 of them, and here are some of them.
[02:21:21.897 --> 02:21:23.318]  And again, this isn't about Alex Jones.
[02:21:24.359 --> 02:21:27.001]  This is about the control and the manipulation.
[02:21:27.341 --> 02:21:33.486]  The whole new YouTube scandal, where somebody at the debate talked about the Federal Reserve, so Google ran and censored that.
[02:21:35.441 --> 02:21:36.662]  The whole point is censorship.
[02:21:37.702 --> 02:21:41.443]  Alex Jones looks set to be brought down once and for all, GQ.
[02:21:42.963 --> 02:21:48.585]  And they literally say that I'm this all-powerful demon that beat up children as a child and painted my tongue black.
[02:21:49.025 --> 02:21:53.187]  None of this is true, but they've learned outrageous lies must be true because they're so crazy.
[02:21:55.165 --> 02:21:56.806]  You know, all of it.
[02:21:57.827 --> 02:22:02.791]  But what they say in here is that I've got to be destroyed, but they say it's a consolation prize.
[02:22:02.831 --> 02:22:07.875]  They can't get Trump, but they can get me, and then he won't have his base.
[02:22:07.976 --> 02:22:11.098]  As if, if I went away, the base wouldn't still support Trump.
[02:22:11.138 --> 02:22:12.039]  It's just pure idiocy.
[02:22:12.059 --> 02:22:13.160]  So here's another one.
[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:16.503]  Alex Jones, under oath, is an antidote to post-age truth.
[02:22:16.523 --> 02:22:17.003]  New York Times.
[02:22:17.423 --> 02:22:18.744]  And it says he's a
[02:22:20.083 --> 02:22:22.583]  Hashtag resistance consolation prize.
[02:22:22.843 --> 02:22:26.944]  So this is everywhere in the news that I'm a consolation prize.
[02:22:27.604 --> 02:22:28.184]  And here's another one.
[02:22:28.244 --> 02:22:32.245]  No, Alex Jones is not a seer about sex abuse conspiracies.
[02:22:32.765 --> 02:22:36.446]  And the National Review criticized their own reporter for saying I was right.
[02:22:36.806 --> 02:22:42.807]  And then I found all these articles that never made the Google feed of all the mainstream news saying people had souls.
[02:22:43.227 --> 02:22:44.807]  Well, I guess Alex is actually right.
[02:22:45.167 --> 02:22:48.608]  I had no idea there were all these articles admitting that I was right about that.
[02:22:48.668 --> 02:22:49.348]  So that's pretty big.
[02:22:49.588 --> 02:22:58.932]  Well, yeah, in fact, what happened right after Epstein is a writer wrote for The Week, which is a left-leaning publication, which he said, if you follow the Fox News world or the mainstream media world, you cannot understand Epstein.
[02:22:59.292 --> 02:23:04.475]  But if you followed Alex Jones and Infowars, you could fully predict and forecast exactly what was going to happen.
[02:23:04.835 --> 02:23:16.080]  I was like, I was watching the movie The Whistleblower, where I was like, watching the movie, I was like, if she had spent any time watching Infowars, she could have better defended those kids and what was happening in the human trafficking by Dincor and other related entities working with the UN.
[02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:22.764]  But because to her that world didn't exist, her world was the New York Times world, she couldn't forecast what was really happening.
[02:23:22.784 --> 02:23:23.244]  And that's it!
[02:23:23.404 --> 02:23:29.548]  They live in the fantasy land of these high-rises and these corporate constructs and they're telling us we live in fantasy land.
[02:23:29.828 --> 02:23:30.189]  Exactly.
[02:23:30.269 --> 02:23:40.235]  Because the reality is a reality that contradicts their fantasy world and that can't create or recreate the propagation of power that they're able to maintain and sustain with their fantasy world.
[02:23:40.535 --> 02:23:47.039]  And so that's why there's this constant attack on you, which is really a constant attack on the audience, because this is such a powerful, independent voice.
[02:23:47.099 --> 02:23:53.824]  Well, it's like that line written by Millis in Apocalypse Now, where you got the army assassin.
[02:23:53.844 --> 02:23:56.746]  He's about to go out and meet with the general and, you know, try to go kill Colonel Kurtz.
[02:23:57.546 --> 02:24:00.668]  And he's saying, you know, I'm here in the hotel drinking, partying, getting weaker.
[02:24:00.748 --> 02:24:02.149]  Charlie's out there in the jungle getting stronger.
[02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:03.570]  We're in the jungle.
[02:24:03.930 --> 02:24:06.472]  And as long as we stay in the fight, resistance is victory.
[02:24:06.532 --> 02:24:07.173]  We're getting stronger.
[02:24:07.193 --> 02:24:07.693]  They're getting weaker.
[02:24:07.893 --> 02:24:16.146]  Absolutely, and that's seen repeatedly, and what they're obsessed with is they can't believe InfoWars' audience is willing to sustain InfoWars against this institutional onslaught.
[02:24:16.506 --> 02:24:23.477]  And so the fact that people continue to back it, continue to support it, continue to find different products that they like to support their lifestyles, but also support InfoWars,
[02:24:23.757 --> 02:24:28.679]  And by the way, the great part about InfoWars' worldview, which they say in this Esquire article, is Jones has shifted the whole paradigm.
[02:24:28.699 --> 02:24:30.020]  No, I haven't shifted any paradigm.
[02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:54.372]  You're known liars.
[02:24:54.412 --> 02:24:55.213]  You've been found out.
[02:24:55.253 --> 02:24:57.975]  You've just chosen to think that I'm the one that did it.
[02:24:59.476 --> 02:25:02.799]  But the truth is, once you understand the globalist model, then everything makes sense.
[02:25:02.839 --> 02:25:03.539]  You know how to beat them.
[02:25:03.880 --> 02:25:04.900]  And that's why they're so pissed.
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:06.261]  We've been in the dark the whole time.
[02:25:06.682 --> 02:25:08.523]  They've got night vision killing us in the dark.
[02:25:08.904 --> 02:25:10.265]  InfoWars is like night vision.
[02:25:10.325 --> 02:25:11.626]  Now you're on an even playing field.
[02:25:11.846 --> 02:25:12.647]  Now you can see.
[02:25:13.007 --> 02:25:14.408]  Well, you saw it yesterday in live time.
[02:25:14.428 --> 02:25:14.868]  We're good to go.
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:41.912]  So the independent audience does their own independent investigation that supports the inquiries that InfoWars does, that spreads knowledge in a way that helps predict and forecast how the entire world looks.
[02:25:42.212 --> 02:25:46.037]  And that's why if you know, if you've followed InfoWars, you can forecast
[02:25:46.277 --> 02:25:47.778]  What's going to happen in the movie The Whistleblower?
[02:25:47.958 --> 02:25:50.040]  You can forecast what's going to happen with Epstein.
[02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:51.100]  You understand it.
[02:25:51.180 --> 02:25:52.521]  You can put it into context.
[02:25:52.541 --> 02:25:56.484]  Because criminals follow a criminology more than the general public follows an OCD.
[02:25:56.764 --> 02:26:00.187]  You think of someone OCD as following programs or being Asperger's.
[02:26:00.307 --> 02:26:03.409]  Criminals, in the type of criminality they are, follow exact paradigms.
[02:26:03.629 --> 02:26:08.813]  It's how cops can get maps and figure out when the next serial killing thing is going to happen six months from now and where.
[02:26:09.153 --> 02:26:10.574]  It's because there's a weird pattern.
[02:26:10.814 --> 02:26:11.575]  Exactly.
[02:26:11.835 --> 02:26:14.237]  It's recognizing their mentality and their mindset.
[02:26:14.518 --> 02:26:21.523]  The mindset of these elites is an anti-human, pro-authority mindset that wants to control and sees populations as cattle.
[02:26:21.703 --> 02:26:22.704]  They see them as labor.
[02:26:22.764 --> 02:26:25.026]  They see them as sources of pleasure.
[02:26:25.086 --> 02:26:28.169]  They see them as sources and tools that they can have power over.
[02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:29.770]  They don't see human beings.
[02:26:29.790 --> 02:26:30.951]  They don't see individuals.
[02:26:31.211 --> 02:26:32.352]  They're institutional and approachable.
[02:26:32.372 --> 02:26:34.374]  They don't see something valuable to interface with.
[02:26:34.654 --> 02:26:35.014]  Exactly.
[02:26:35.034 --> 02:26:35.835]  And that's what the counter is.
[02:26:35.875 --> 02:26:38.117]  If you understand... They want to run you instead of interface.
[02:26:38.337 --> 02:26:39.458]  I want to interface with you.
[02:26:39.759 --> 02:26:40.079]  Exactly.
[02:26:40.099 --> 02:26:46.645]  And what you're uncloaking is this anti-humanitarian objective that for them sex trafficking is second nature.
[02:26:46.965 --> 02:26:48.266]  Because once you... We're masters.
[02:26:48.286 --> 02:26:49.147]  We traffic humans.
[02:26:49.327 --> 02:26:49.667]  Exactly.
[02:26:49.747 --> 02:26:51.649]  It's just appropriate in their world.
[02:26:51.929 --> 02:26:58.555]  Because just as it's appropriate to tell a three-year-old what gender they are, even against their own... It's all about power.
[02:26:58.835 --> 02:26:59.276]  Exactly.
[02:26:59.316 --> 02:27:00.357]  It's because they don't see humans.
[02:27:00.597 --> 02:27:01.378]  They're anti-human.
[02:27:01.579 --> 02:27:02.380]  They're pro-power.
[02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:03.561]  They're pro-authoritarian.
[02:27:03.581 --> 02:27:04.522]  They're pro-institutional.
[02:27:04.542 --> 02:27:05.564]  They're not pro-individual.
[02:27:05.764 --> 02:27:06.465]  They're not pro-human.
[02:27:06.485 --> 02:27:07.546]  The truth is they're mentally ill.
[02:27:07.827 --> 02:27:08.988]  Oh, completely mentally ill.
[02:27:09.168 --> 02:27:11.491]  And they want to spread their mental illness to the rest of the world.
[02:27:11.692 --> 02:27:13.274]  They want to pervert the entire world.
[02:27:13.314 --> 02:27:15.156]  They want to make our environment their environment.
[02:27:15.296 --> 02:27:15.656]  Exactly.
[02:27:15.716 --> 02:27:21.842]  And because they're unable and unsuccessful to do so, they go nuts at the people who pull back the curtain and show that the emperor has no clothes.
[02:27:22.102 --> 02:27:23.523]  And that's why they're obsessed with InfoWars.
[02:27:23.543 --> 02:27:25.044]  That's why they're obsessed with Alex Jones.
[02:27:25.265 --> 02:27:27.306]  But what they don't realize is they can't defeat the audience.
[02:27:27.366 --> 02:27:29.088]  Because the audience is what fuels InfoWars.
[02:27:29.328 --> 02:27:31.190]  And that's not a pat on the head, folks.
[02:27:31.210 --> 02:27:32.170]  Without you, we're doomed.
[02:27:32.871 --> 02:27:33.672]  And that'll be okay.
[02:27:34.052 --> 02:27:37.495]  And they even admit in the article, well, the disease is already spreading.
[02:27:37.755 --> 02:27:38.756]  It's not a disease.
[02:27:38.836 --> 02:27:39.537]  It's called victory.
[02:27:40.310 --> 02:27:40.690]  Exactly.
[02:27:40.730 --> 02:27:41.511]  It's independence.
[02:27:41.571 --> 02:27:41.951]  It's true.
[02:27:42.011 --> 02:27:45.674]  It's independence of thought, independence of action, independence of spirit, independence of soul.
[02:27:45.954 --> 02:27:50.917]  It's keeping the soul of humanitarianism alive against these institutional threats and these power-driven individuals.
[02:27:51.217 --> 02:27:53.038]  And that's what is unique and exceptional about it.
[02:27:53.078 --> 02:27:59.402]  The American democratic experiment can only work with an independent free press, and the only truly independent free press in the world is Infowars.
[02:27:59.663 --> 02:28:01.043]  And that's why they see it as such a threat.
[02:28:01.304 --> 02:28:06.227]  And that's why we are able to forecast and foreshadow what's going to happen in democratic debates in ways they can't.
[02:28:06.667 --> 02:28:08.190]  And when are you going to forecast tomorrow?
[02:28:08.450 --> 02:28:09.532]  Let's do one more segment.
[02:28:09.552 --> 02:28:10.975]  Mike Adams is coming up.
[02:28:11.015 --> 02:28:11.535]  He understands.
[02:28:11.556 --> 02:28:13.739]  I'll push him back to 15 after because I've got to get to this.
[02:28:14.541 --> 02:28:16.684]  I've done a bunch of reports that are very good.
[02:28:16.925 --> 02:28:20.170]  I was on Man Cal, a good friend of mine, this morning.
[02:28:24.484 --> 02:28:37.156]  He's smart as I am, he just won't say it all, but he kind of went off and said even more today than I've said about where the rabbit hole goes with the child molestation and the vampiric psychic stealing that's going on.
[02:28:37.176 --> 02:28:38.497]  We're going to get to that.
[02:28:38.617 --> 02:28:42.220]  Also, my 26-month-old daughter singing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:43.281]  It was an encore this morning.
[02:28:43.582 --> 02:28:43.882]  She did it.
[02:28:43.902 --> 02:28:44.562]  I asked her to do it again.
[02:28:44.582 --> 02:28:48.746]  I want to show good versus evil coming up here as well, but I want to
[02:28:49.858 --> 02:28:51.640]  Why don't I just ask you to hold over?
[02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:53.762]  Oh, you're handicapping tonight's debate.
[02:28:53.942 --> 02:28:59.267]  Yep, forecasting and foreshadowing whether Biden can speak correctly and whether Harris will race bait again.
[02:28:59.467 --> 02:29:01.009]  Okay, and then we've got more coming up.
[02:29:02.301 --> 02:29:02.862]  Attention!
[02:29:03.082 --> 02:29:05.384]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:29:05.784 --> 02:29:11.789]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:29:12.150 --> 02:29:13.871]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:29:13.891 --> 02:29:20.477]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[02:29:20.737 --> 02:29:26.601]  Made with ancient ingredients used for thousands of years, Happies can help you take back the day.
[02:29:26.922 --> 02:29:32.726]  With our powerhouse formula, Happies can be an important part of your daily supplement routine.
[02:29:33.046 --> 02:29:40.952]  With poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life, it's more important than ever to support your body in the fight against stress.
[02:29:41.292 --> 02:29:46.316]  With powerful ingredients combined to help support the mind and body, Happies
[02:29:46.636 --> 02:29:47.597]  It's happening now.
[02:29:47.617 --> 02:29:48.037]  Right now.
[02:29:48.077 --> 02:29:53.581]  All over the world, humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist, globalist, world government, Mark of the Beast agenda.
[02:30:13.723 --> 02:30:18.048]  The forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the Temposphere Info Wars more than ever.
[02:30:18.809 --> 02:30:27.940]  Well, we're doing a special 40-hour broadcast to get new projects we've developed up and into orbit and to take action at the next level.
[02:30:28.621 --> 02:30:30.503]  The globalists know we've already devastated them.
[02:30:31.084 --> 02:30:35.008]  And they hope that you don't take action, because when you support InfoWars, you change the world.
[02:30:35.788 --> 02:30:40.232]  Find coverage at clownworld.us and at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:30:40.252 --> 02:30:50.722]  But whatever you do, join us during this special 40-hour broadcast that's happening right now, and spread the word, because that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech censors.
[02:30:51.042 --> 02:30:55.506]  Again, infowars.com, forward slash show, or clownworld.us.
[02:30:55.786 --> 02:30:56.427]  Please take action.
[02:31:04.611 --> 02:31:09.477]  Casey, I'm sure it's wishful thinking, you're saying, Tyra comes back from nowhere, is he on turbo force?
[02:31:09.938 --> 02:31:14.083]  Which is an amazing pre-workout and long-term energy system, unlike any other.
[02:31:14.704 --> 02:31:17.007]  Or Tyra Woods isn't actually taking turbo force, is he?
[02:31:17.247 --> 02:31:18.990]  That's a good idea though, I should try to send him some.
[02:31:19.250 --> 02:31:21.613]  I'm not entirely sure, but when I was watching the
[02:31:21.633 --> 02:31:22.074]  I'm good.
[02:31:36.915 --> 02:31:38.015]  I'll have to try to find out.
[02:31:38.055 --> 02:31:38.315]  I know.
[02:31:38.335 --> 02:31:39.996]  I've been told about multiple folks that are friends with him.
[02:31:40.016 --> 02:31:41.816]  He's a listener, but I don't really worry about stuff like that.
[02:31:41.856 --> 02:31:42.436]  But that's great.
[02:31:42.456 --> 02:31:42.716]  Who knows?
[02:31:42.736 --> 02:31:43.757]  He might be on Turbo Force.
[02:31:43.797 --> 02:31:44.097]  Who knows?
[02:31:44.277 --> 02:31:50.338]  Well, last year, when he won his first tournament in a long time, they tried to grill him on, like, degrading the president in some way.
[02:31:50.358 --> 02:31:53.519]  You know, this is what you need in a press conference after a golf tournament, and he wouldn't do it.
[02:31:53.639 --> 02:31:53.859]  I know.
[02:31:53.899 --> 02:31:54.679]  He's friends with Trump.
[02:31:54.719 --> 02:31:56.080]  He's been friends with Trump, like, 20 years.
[02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:56.880]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:31:56.900 --> 02:31:58.540]  The media wasn't even talking about his win.
[02:31:58.560 --> 02:32:00.081]  They were talking about his politics.
[02:32:00.101 --> 02:32:00.681]  Thank you, Casey.
[02:32:04.292 --> 02:32:07.993]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[02:33:05.732 --> 02:33:11.875]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:20.498 --> 02:33:29.582]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:30.482 --> 02:33:34.364]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:35.965 --> 02:33:40.700]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:42.133 --> 02:33:42.713]  You built it.
[02:33:43.034 --> 02:33:44.254]  You built this operation.
[02:33:44.314 --> 02:33:44.815]  It's yours.
[02:33:45.155 --> 02:33:45.835]  The enemy knows it.
[02:33:46.476 --> 02:33:48.077]  I thank you all for your support and your prayers.
[02:33:48.157 --> 02:33:50.759]  I'll tell you again, we make it easy.
[02:33:50.779 --> 02:33:51.759]  50% off to 60% off.
[02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:54.881]  Storewide, free shipping, double Patriot points.
[02:33:55.662 --> 02:33:57.803]  We're trying to hit a million dollars gross to bring in about $300,000.
[02:33:57.903 --> 02:34:08.810]  Extra than we would normally bring in during a week so that I can launch some covert operations that are all legal and lawful that are, let's just say,
[02:34:10.451 --> 02:34:11.572]  Hmm.
[02:34:11.592 --> 02:34:12.592]  Shouldn't say too much, should I?
[02:34:13.232 --> 02:34:15.393]  Let's just say White House approved.
[02:34:17.053 --> 02:34:20.915]  But this is all organic, this is all completely of the people, okay?
[02:34:21.975 --> 02:34:28.217]  And I should have done this a long time ago, had a lot of plans I haven't implemented, but we're finally accelerating all of our operations.
[02:34:29.864 --> 02:34:32.827]  It's like when they say put on all sail when a ship wants to go the fastest.
[02:34:32.867 --> 02:34:38.793]  We are spending every dime we've got on operations we've got going and we need more.
[02:34:39.394 --> 02:34:46.241]  So get your coffee, get your toothpaste, get your non-gmo heirloom seeds, get your air filtration, get your water filtration at m4warsstore.com.
[02:34:46.922 --> 02:34:48.904]  Go to m4wars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:34:49.665 --> 02:34:52.067]  To sign up for the free newsletter go to m4wars.com forward slash shub.
[02:34:53.115 --> 02:34:53.596]  We're good to go.
[02:35:05.584 --> 02:35:07.345]  Is product sales show.
[02:35:07.365 --> 02:35:11.088]  I haven't done the math yet, but it's probably like $120,000 or something, which is great.
[02:35:12.029 --> 02:35:15.712]  Normally we'd have like $20,000, $30,000 extra money a day to actually try to fund things.
[02:35:16.172 --> 02:35:21.136]  We, we, again, Vox and all these people get hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
[02:35:21.916 --> 02:35:24.278]  Vice gets billions a year to spew all their left-wing crap.
[02:35:24.338 --> 02:35:27.720]  And it's not like a billion bucks, but it's product sales.
[02:35:27.740 --> 02:35:28.421]  So they get half of it.
[02:35:28.481 --> 02:35:29.342]  It's all that money.
[02:35:29.362 --> 02:35:33.645]  You have to understand, like if we bring in $30 million a year, it's like 15 million we have to spend.
[02:35:34.730 --> 02:35:37.393]  And we do our own servers, we do our own bandwidth, we have our own IT.
[02:35:38.033 --> 02:35:39.955]  I'm spending everything now, and I'm not complaining.
[02:35:41.157 --> 02:35:51.367]  But I haven't been paid this year, and I'm living off money that I saved years ago, which I even intended to spend if it gets down to having to fund this place, but that would just run us a few months.
[02:35:52.890 --> 02:35:57.296]  So it's very important that you financially support us.
[02:35:57.336 --> 02:36:03.023]  Sure, I could dial back and go longer, but my gut, my instinct says full speed ahead.
[02:36:03.143 --> 02:36:04.444]  Launch everything I've got.
[02:36:04.965 --> 02:36:07.628]  No strings attached to all these groups that are doing things.
[02:36:08.149 --> 02:36:10.272]  And the incredible thing is everything we've launched
[02:36:12.116 --> 02:36:15.017]  Has paid off in reaching people spectacularly.
[02:36:15.657 --> 02:36:20.998]  Because, sure, we've been blackballed, but it wasn't Alex Jones and my ugly face that made it so successful.
[02:36:21.018 --> 02:36:21.698]  It was the information.
[02:36:22.359 --> 02:36:24.639]  Other people with the same info are even more successful.
[02:36:25.339 --> 02:36:30.821]  And so we've really hit the event horizon, but we've got to get up into orbit with these new secret payloads.
[02:36:30.841 --> 02:36:32.561]  That's why I use the space shuttle.
[02:36:33.241 --> 02:36:34.682]  80% of its missions were secret military missions.
[02:36:35.062 --> 02:36:39.063]  This is a civilian mission of the people on organic resistance, but we need to get up into orbit
[02:36:39.403 --> 02:36:45.291]  Because I've got seven projects going, a couple have been launched, five are about to be launched, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:36:45.552 --> 02:36:50.559]  Now, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, a good friend of mine, a month ago you and Owen...
[02:36:51.550 --> 02:36:57.773]  A lot of the clips tonight when you're on, because we're getting them right now, you laid out exactly who would win, who would win the polls, who would be the most Google searched.
[02:36:58.313 --> 02:37:02.414]  How you even came up with what you thought you should look at was amazing, because that ended up being the big issue of the night.
[02:37:02.795 --> 02:37:10.698]  And you predicted again last night exactly what would happen about Mary Ann Williamson, about all of it.
[02:37:11.278 --> 02:37:12.359]  And about who will be the loser.
[02:37:12.399 --> 02:37:14.619]  So give us your new predictions for tonight.
[02:37:14.860 --> 02:37:17.401]  We'll have reporters on the ground in Detroit, Michigan covering it as well.
[02:37:17.761 --> 02:37:18.681]  Live coverage, folks.
[02:37:18.921 --> 02:37:20.422]  And again, you're the missing element.
[02:37:20.482 --> 02:37:21.922]  You're the fifth element.
[02:37:21.962 --> 02:37:23.103]  You're the critical catalyst.
[02:37:23.163 --> 02:37:26.904]  Tell everybody you know on email, on Facebook, on Twitter, in person.
[02:37:26.964 --> 02:37:27.965]  Don't tell them InfoWorks.com.
[02:37:28.025 --> 02:37:28.585]  That'll get censored.
[02:37:29.912 --> 02:37:38.182]  Tell them clownworld.us for the censored, forbidden coverage of the most accurate analysis that they don't want you to have.
[02:37:39.083 --> 02:37:39.624]  I keep saying it.
[02:37:39.824 --> 02:37:40.365]  Do you understand?
[02:37:40.585 --> 02:37:42.768]  When you move and take action, it's all over.
[02:37:42.988 --> 02:37:46.332]  They want me off the air, so I'm not telling you how powerful you are.
[02:37:46.352 --> 02:37:47.834]  You understand that?
[02:37:49.079 --> 02:37:50.040]  You are everything.
[02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:51.340]  You're not just part of the equation.
[02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:51.901]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:37:52.261 --> 02:37:52.721]  Absolutely.
[02:37:53.381 --> 02:37:54.662]  So I think tonight will be a couple of things.
[02:37:54.862 --> 02:37:59.905]  One, what the expectation is of the median political establishment is that Kamala Harris will take out Joe Biden.
[02:38:00.285 --> 02:38:06.549]  She did severe damage to him in the first debate, but she has not managed to take out his political support in any sufficient number.
[02:38:06.569 --> 02:38:11.051]  He's still got double-digit leads in most national polls, big leads in South Carolina, older African Americans.
[02:38:11.071 --> 02:38:12.152]  The long knives are coming out.
[02:38:12.472 --> 02:38:12.852]  Exactly.
[02:38:12.912 --> 02:38:15.715]  She needs to attack and attack and attack and do so repeatedly.
[02:38:16.075 --> 02:38:22.180]  And a large portion of the donor establishment and the media establishment and the political establishment wants to see that happen.
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:24.101]  So you're predicting it's going to be a bloodbath?
[02:38:24.282 --> 02:38:25.342]  Yes, I think it will be.
[02:38:25.362 --> 02:38:27.804]  And I think Biden will try to defend himself aggressively.
[02:38:28.085 --> 02:38:34.530]  We'll see whether or not there's a lot of rumors and ruminations that Biden really didn't want to run, that Biden is second-guessing the fact that he has won.
[02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:36.732]  Well, I've heard from folks that are around him, like, why am I doing this?
[02:38:36.752 --> 02:38:37.172]  Screw this.
[02:38:37.472 --> 02:38:37.972]  Absolutely.
[02:38:38.032 --> 02:38:38.833]  He's just being embarrassed.
[02:38:38.873 --> 02:38:40.074]  His legacy is being destroyed.
[02:38:40.114 --> 02:38:41.735]  His kids are being put under investigation.
[02:38:41.995 --> 02:38:43.116]  Does he want this to continue?
[02:38:43.396 --> 02:38:45.698]  So we'll see tonight how serious he is in two ways.
[02:38:46.118 --> 02:38:52.042]  First, can he drug himself up in such a way like Hillary did in 2016 so that the health concerns dissipate?
[02:38:52.342 --> 02:38:55.284]  Because he did not maintain multiple sentences.
[02:38:55.344 --> 02:38:56.205]  He's beyond sluggish.
[02:38:56.485 --> 02:38:57.445]  It looked terrible.
[02:38:57.526 --> 02:39:02.169]  It was a cognitive problem that could not even be covered up for two minutes.
[02:39:02.689 --> 02:39:04.230]  And so will we see the same kind of thing?
[02:39:04.250 --> 02:39:05.511]  He can't go two minutes without just
[02:39:05.811 --> 02:39:06.131]  Exactly.
[02:39:06.191 --> 02:39:07.572]  I think we'll continue to see the same problem.
[02:39:07.853 --> 02:39:09.194]  I think the problem is incurable.
[02:39:09.474 --> 02:39:12.036]  I think whatever it is, he can't even mask it for a short period of time.
[02:39:12.056 --> 02:39:14.017]  I don't even think they can drug him up to keep him maintaining it.
[02:39:14.417 --> 02:39:16.239]  If he's very aggressive and... Sort of neurological.
[02:39:16.459 --> 02:39:16.819]  Exactly.
[02:39:17.059 --> 02:39:28.528]  If he attacks everybody up there or he starts attacking Harris in particular, this will be a sign that he really doesn't want to run, but he wants to attack back for people trying to destroy his legacy for the fact that the big donors... Which he's threatened to do.
[02:39:28.688 --> 02:39:28.928]  Correct.
[02:39:29.028 --> 02:39:31.990]  Which could make tonight, last night, was slit-your-wrist boring, I'll admit it.
[02:39:32.371 --> 02:39:33.772]  I mean, I frickin' left, okay?
[02:39:33.832 --> 02:39:34.572]  I'm not gonna lie to people.
[02:39:34.873 --> 02:39:37.655]  But tonight could be... You're talking about explosions.
[02:39:37.675 --> 02:39:38.796]  You could see major drama.
[02:39:38.876 --> 02:39:41.538]  I think the political establishment is expecting major drama.
[02:39:41.758 --> 02:39:45.020]  We'll find out what Biden's real intentions are by how he approaches the debate.
[02:39:45.281 --> 02:39:49.464]  We'll find out whether Kamala Harris really wants the presidency by how she approaches it.
[02:39:49.984 --> 02:39:57.093]  And if she's smart, the candidate who can once again win the Drudge Poll, once again win the Google search engines, can be Tulsi Gabbard.
[02:39:57.113 --> 02:40:07.226]  What she needs to do is there's talk that she'll talk about Julian Assange's case, that she'll talk about big tech censorship, that she'll talk about things that are close to the Trumpist base that challenge the democratic establishment narrative.
[02:40:07.426 --> 02:40:07.826]  No, I agree.
[02:40:07.927 --> 02:40:10.669]  Now, those are easy predictions, and I'm not poo-pooing you.
[02:40:11.090 --> 02:40:15.334]  A month ago and last night, you were like, this will be the Google search, this will be the numbers.
[02:40:15.374 --> 02:40:16.294]  It was exactly right.
[02:40:16.354 --> 02:40:18.336]  So give us your stunning analysis.
[02:40:18.476 --> 02:40:23.421]  So I think right now, Kamala Harris is actually still leading in the betting market.
[02:40:23.441 --> 02:40:24.262]  She's got 27-28%.
[02:40:24.542 --> 02:40:29.187]  I think if Kamala Harris doesn't deliver as much as she should, I think Kamala Harris will take a hit.
[02:40:29.207 --> 02:40:30.868]  I think she'll take probably like a 5-10% hit at the markets.
[02:40:32.229 --> 02:40:35.373]  I think that Joe Biden could bounce back up if he's really counter-aggressive.
[02:40:36.194 --> 02:40:37.475]  Because he knows instinctively.
[02:40:37.695 --> 02:40:38.656]  Yeah, he has to.
[02:40:38.676 --> 02:40:42.080]  He needs to restore the credibility of the donor class in him.
[02:40:42.100 --> 02:40:47.005]  He'll either do that or he'll sort of go out in a blaze of glory by being counter-attacking.
[02:40:47.045 --> 02:40:48.566]  So we'll see what happens in that regard.
[02:40:48.867 --> 02:40:49.908]  But that would be my forecast.
[02:40:50.228 --> 02:41:00.917]  And I think Tulsi Gabbard will be smart enough to at least get a viral moment in the debates by pushing the stories that the Democratic debate doesn't want to talk about.
[02:41:01.217 --> 02:41:09.004]  Like what you'll see from our coverage that you won't see from the questioners is going into their individual scandals and other questions that need to be discussed and debated.
[02:41:09.044 --> 02:41:12.266]  Oh again, it's ridiculously obvious that if you're going to watch this,
[02:41:13.027 --> 02:41:13.747]  Debacle.
[02:41:14.267 --> 02:41:16.468]  It needs to be InfoWars, but you get that, listeners.
[02:41:16.508 --> 02:41:18.449]  What we're asking is to win the war of information.
[02:41:18.469 --> 02:41:21.730]  Reach out to people and say, hey, you've heard of Alex Jones.
[02:41:21.750 --> 02:41:22.630]  You've heard of Robert Barnes.
[02:41:22.690 --> 02:41:23.831]  You've probably heard about a lot of stuff.
[02:41:24.211 --> 02:41:30.073]  Why don't you tune in and see it for yourself what they don't want you to see so that we're doing live coverage tonight?
[02:41:30.093 --> 02:41:32.114]  Because that's how we get new people in.
[02:41:32.134 --> 02:41:34.434]  And we found when we get new people, they stay.
[02:41:34.775 --> 02:41:37.916]  That's why the system is so scared and doesn't want us going in 2020.
[02:41:37.956 --> 02:41:38.696]  But the good news is,
[02:41:39.923 --> 02:41:40.404]  We're here.
[02:41:41.045 --> 02:41:41.606]  We're together.
[02:41:42.227 --> 02:41:42.868]  We're strong.
[02:41:43.789 --> 02:41:45.232]  I'll just let the enemy know what's really going on.
[02:41:45.372 --> 02:41:48.017]  If I sell out all the product I have, we can run for a year.
[02:41:48.037 --> 02:41:52.023]  If I... I'm going to make a decision the next month about what I'm going to do.
[02:41:52.063 --> 02:41:53.305]  But if we don't reorder...
[02:41:54.912 --> 02:41:56.253]  We'll shut down then.
[02:41:56.733 --> 02:41:59.075]  So I can fund this for a year with the product we have.
[02:41:59.515 --> 02:42:05.018]  The problem is if I don't reorder, then in a year or less we won't have the product to keep going and we'll shut down.
[02:42:05.359 --> 02:42:08.641]  Which maybe that's our mission and everybody here will get a new job and everything else.
[02:42:08.921 --> 02:42:10.702]  But I mean we are to that point.
[02:42:11.362 --> 02:42:14.925]  And I'm maxed out and I've been begging for help and you've kept us there.
[02:42:14.965 --> 02:42:18.207]  But it's always God just gives us like the widow's mind exactly what we need.
[02:42:19.591 --> 02:42:21.212]  Folks, I need to make decisions.
[02:42:21.392 --> 02:42:24.515]  I need extra capital to do these projects, and I'm not complaining.
[02:42:24.635 --> 02:42:25.035]  Thank you.
[02:42:25.075 --> 02:42:25.636]  You're amazing.
[02:42:25.696 --> 02:42:27.977]  I'm just saying, who has paid off like this?
[02:42:28.578 --> 02:42:34.702]  What system in your life, if you bought products at Walmart or Target or wherever, and had them politically save your future?
[02:42:35.063 --> 02:42:38.645]  Just go to InfoWarshaw.com, make a straight donation, or buy the products.
[02:42:38.705 --> 02:42:45.871]  We need to see a surge to know that we can launch these operations, because I've got operations ready that are going to devastate the globalists.
[02:42:46.211 --> 02:42:47.292]  Robert Barnes, you're going to be back.
[02:42:47.492 --> 02:42:51.354]  During the War Room, back during live coverage tonight of the debates, kicks off 7 o'clock central.
[02:42:51.374 --> 02:42:52.134]  I'll be here as well.
[02:42:52.494 --> 02:42:52.995]  Stay with us.
[02:42:53.015 --> 02:42:54.495]  Something really important on the other side.
[02:42:54.776 --> 02:42:55.436]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:43:02.159 --> 02:43:02.920]  It's happening now.
[02:43:20.925 --> 02:43:22.207]  Now the Democrats are coming.
[02:43:23.008 --> 02:43:28.695]  Now to Decision 2020 as the Democratic candidates for president descend on Detroit.
[02:43:28.715 --> 02:43:31.097]  20 presidential candidates will head to Detroit.
[02:43:31.298 --> 02:43:33.240]  Democratic presidential primary debates.
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:36.444]  This time the candidates are making their case in Detroit.
[02:43:36.544 --> 02:43:40.008]  Tonight, Democratic presidential debate event in Detroit.
[02:43:40.629 --> 02:43:45.334]  Good evening from the historic Fox Theater in downtown Detroit, Michigan!
[02:43:51.738 --> 02:43:54.199]  This moment will define us forever.
[02:43:54.719 --> 02:43:57.840]  I'm running for president because our country is running out of time.
[02:43:58.121 --> 02:44:00.281]  And I'm here to say this isn't about left or right.
[02:44:00.982 --> 02:44:03.202]  This is about new and better.
[02:44:03.723 --> 02:44:04.483]  Free everything.
[02:44:05.103 --> 02:44:07.684]  Our problems didn't start with Donald Trump.
[02:44:08.204 --> 02:44:10.145]  You're gonna hear a lot of promises up here.
[02:44:10.465 --> 02:44:15.447]  Impossible promises that'll turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected.
[02:44:15.787 --> 02:44:19.429]  Successfully confronting endless war and climate change.
[02:44:20.229 --> 02:44:23.591]  We're not going to solve the urgent problems that we face.
[02:44:24.052 --> 02:44:24.672]  Endless war.
[02:44:24.792 --> 02:44:25.552]  Climate change.
[02:44:25.973 --> 02:44:28.154]  I was out of work for two whole years.
[02:44:28.554 --> 02:44:31.276]  And I have had it with the racist attacks.
[02:44:31.556 --> 02:44:36.199]  In the face of cruelty and fear from a lawless president.
[02:44:36.219 --> 02:44:42.703]  Science tells us we have 12 years before we reach the horizon of catastrophe when it comes to our climate.
[02:44:43.403 --> 02:44:49.288]  Donald Trump disgraces the office of president every single day.
[02:44:49.688 --> 02:44:55.973]  We have got to take on Trump's racism, his sexism, xenophobia, and come together.
[02:44:56.194 --> 02:44:56.974]  Free everything.
[02:44:57.334 --> 02:45:00.057]  That's how we win back the places we lost.
[02:45:00.217 --> 02:45:01.798]  That's how we're going to beat Donald Trump.
[02:45:05.161 --> 02:45:07.342]  Let's go to James in Massachusetts.
[02:45:07.703 --> 02:45:08.383]  James, you're on the air.
[02:45:08.403 --> 02:45:08.964]  Thanks for calling.
[02:45:10.661 --> 02:45:11.242]  Hello, Alex.
[02:45:11.882 --> 02:45:13.724]  God bless General Jones.
[02:45:13.784 --> 02:45:15.966]  May you live in peace and love forever.
[02:45:16.026 --> 02:45:17.067]  In Christ's name, we pray.
[02:45:17.208 --> 02:45:17.948]  God bless you, brother.
[02:45:18.169 --> 02:45:19.430]  And I'd like to thank you also.
[02:45:19.450 --> 02:45:22.773]  You know, my wife and I have been married for 17 years, and we were never able to have kids.
[02:45:22.873 --> 02:45:32.002]  And after a couple years of taking the B12 and the iodine, and knowing about not using fluoride and not having vaccines, we have a great, healthy, vibrant, six-year-old boy.
[02:45:32.122 --> 02:45:33.183]  And I thank you very much for that.
[02:45:33.463 --> 02:45:36.164]  Well, you know, fluoride is meant to block fertility.
[02:45:36.624 --> 02:45:39.606]  It's the bad halogen, but iodine is associated with fertility.
[02:45:40.066 --> 02:45:41.166]  So that's a beautiful story.
[02:45:41.206 --> 02:45:42.207]  That's exciting, my friend.
[02:45:42.347 --> 02:45:46.568]  And I've got all the articles right here about IQ, fertility, being boosted on iodine.
[02:45:47.129 --> 02:45:47.569]  You name it.
[02:45:47.829 --> 02:45:51.891]  That's why the system fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here.
[02:45:51.951 --> 02:45:54.192]  Even though I get it from InfoWarsTore.com, it doesn't matter to me.
[02:45:54.252 --> 02:45:56.533]  Just research what deficiencies are doing.
[02:45:56.673 --> 02:45:59.814]  But get back to you and your wife and recap the story you were telling.
[02:46:00.014 --> 02:46:23.523]  So we've been married for 17 years and we never had any children and we bought the water filter first and we got out the fluoride and the glyphosate and then we started taking X2 and B12 and about a year or so later my wife got pregnant with our baby boy and with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's so bright and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you and you're our hero Alex.
[02:46:23.703 --> 02:46:25.025]  Well, that's just beautiful, brother.
[02:46:25.325 --> 02:46:28.448]  And again, it shows the system knows all this.
[02:46:28.789 --> 02:46:33.154]  And it works to keep the people from just getting basic things that the body has to have.
[02:46:33.174 --> 02:46:35.717]  You have to have vitamin C. You have to have iodine.
[02:46:36.057 --> 02:46:36.918]  You have to have water.
[02:46:37.258 --> 02:46:38.220]  You have to have oxygen.
[02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:41.001]  Instead, the whole system works to block that.
[02:46:41.121 --> 02:46:42.162]  It's just so powerful.
[02:46:42.362 --> 02:46:43.302]  It's what we're made of.
[02:46:43.742 --> 02:46:45.583]  I'm sitting here trying to explain this to people.
[02:46:45.603 --> 02:46:47.124]  We're not just making this stuff up.
[02:46:47.304 --> 02:46:48.424]  It's just everything.
[02:46:48.444 --> 02:46:50.325]  But again, the other iodines are bound.
[02:46:50.345 --> 02:46:51.446]  You don't absorb them.
[02:46:51.886 --> 02:46:53.307]  Everyone calls their iodine atomic.
[02:46:53.547 --> 02:46:55.988]  I wish everyone else was selling atomic iodine.
[02:46:56.068 --> 02:46:56.468]  They're not.
[02:46:56.628 --> 02:46:58.249]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:47:06.644 --> 02:47:09.366]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.830 --> 02:47:15.530]  Big Brother.
[02:47:15.970 --> 02:47:17.191]  Mainstream media.
[02:47:17.772 --> 02:47:18.872]  Government cover-ups.
[02:47:19.653 --> 02:47:21.074]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:47:21.354 --> 02:47:22.475]  Well, so does he.
[02:47:22.995 --> 02:47:27.738]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:31.161 --> 02:47:31.401]  Show.
[02:47:33.303 --> 02:47:35.305]  This morning I woke up about 5.30 a.m.
[02:47:36.166 --> 02:47:37.327]  Sort of doing research right away.
[02:47:37.347 --> 02:47:39.729]  A couple hours till my children are off from school.
[02:47:39.769 --> 02:47:40.169]  Woke up.
[02:47:43.352 --> 02:47:45.373]  And I was sitting there this morning at about 7 a.m.
[02:47:45.414 --> 02:47:46.735]  as my daughters woke up and came in.
[02:47:46.755 --> 02:47:47.675]  I was cooking them breakfast.
[02:47:49.137 --> 02:47:52.600]  And I just looked at them and I thought, you know, that's good right there.
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:53.560]  Innocence.
[02:47:53.601 --> 02:47:54.341]  The whole future.
[02:47:55.162 --> 02:47:55.602]  Strength.
[02:47:55.642 --> 02:47:56.883]  The purity that God's given us.
[02:47:56.903 --> 02:47:58.565]  The seed of the universe.
[02:47:59.821 --> 02:48:01.242]  And I thought about the globalists now.
[02:48:01.262 --> 02:48:05.967]  They target children and young people to rob their future, to abuse them, the terrible things they're doing.
[02:48:05.987 --> 02:48:10.050]  I thought, you know, I never include my children on air.
[02:48:10.130 --> 02:48:11.051]  My son wanted to be on air.
[02:48:11.071 --> 02:48:12.492]  He's been on air since he was 10 years old.
[02:48:13.493 --> 02:48:14.955]  Rex is 16, almost 17 now.
[02:48:15.755 --> 02:48:16.976]  But I thought about my three daughters.
[02:48:17.077 --> 02:48:20.279]  One is 15, one's 11, one's 26 months old.
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:25.104]  And I thought, well, when the time's right, I want to talk about good versus evil.
[02:48:26.721 --> 02:48:30.945]  And then my youngest daughter this morning started singing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.
[02:48:32.446 --> 02:48:34.608]  And I came back over.
[02:48:34.649 --> 02:48:36.290]  She usually won't do an encore or something.
[02:48:36.310 --> 02:48:39.653]  And everybody says their kids are smart.
[02:48:39.693 --> 02:48:40.294]  They all are smart.
[02:48:40.314 --> 02:48:42.076]  But I mean, this, this, this girl, I won't say her name.
[02:48:42.096 --> 02:48:44.097]  She's just beyond just the next level.
[02:48:45.038 --> 02:48:46.680]  And I went over to her.
[02:48:48.058 --> 02:49:03.430]  And I said on cue to the nanny, but also to the other folks who were at my house, I said, and right on cue she's singing Strangle 20 Little Star, imagine the innocence and purity of this versus the New World Order and Satan.
[02:49:04.711 --> 02:49:08.314]  And imagine if you love children, you love your own daughter, how much God loves us.
[02:49:08.955 --> 02:49:10.976]  God loves the sparrow of the field, as the Bible says.
[02:49:11.036 --> 02:49:13.178]  Imagine how much God loves you.
[02:49:13.899 --> 02:49:15.060]  But we have to be given free will.
[02:49:16.092 --> 02:49:24.719]  And so we have to be willing to have children in this corrupt, evil environment and put them into this bad, evil system to believe in God and to believe in their soul and to believe in their future.
[02:49:25.159 --> 02:49:27.862]  And it's through them that we're given the strength to stand against the enemy.
[02:49:28.982 --> 02:49:45.276]  That's why the enemy doesn't want you to have children, because as stressful it is, as hard as it is, it's a metaphysical moment when you cross the level of Creator and you begin to be that little G that the Old Testament talks about, made in the image of God.
[02:49:46.089 --> 02:49:49.474]  And then now you begin to understand what it's like for God to give us free will.
[02:49:49.855 --> 02:49:55.263]  You know, He loves us so much, we're His children, and we could go bad, we could die, we could be taken to hell for eternity.
[02:49:55.283 --> 02:49:56.064]  You think God likes that?
[02:49:56.104 --> 02:49:57.326]  But God wants children.
[02:49:58.294 --> 02:49:59.235]  God wants consciousness.
[02:49:59.275 --> 02:50:01.316]  God wants to commune with us forever.
[02:50:01.656 --> 02:50:08.401]  And so God has to roll the dice believing that if he creates new entities that have free will, he'll create a whole new universe in their mind.
[02:50:08.461 --> 02:50:09.862]  A whole new potential.
[02:50:10.062 --> 02:50:11.342]  Like God's created this universe.
[02:50:11.883 --> 02:50:12.924]  A whole new potential.
[02:50:12.944 --> 02:50:13.424]  Think of that.
[02:50:13.664 --> 02:50:14.705]  God has to do that.
[02:50:15.285 --> 02:50:15.905]  It's perfect.
[02:50:18.367 --> 02:50:19.188]  It's not just love.
[02:50:19.248 --> 02:50:20.048]  It's gambling.
[02:50:20.609 --> 02:50:21.669]  People say, how am I going to have children?
[02:50:21.689 --> 02:50:22.310]  The world's too evil.
[02:50:23.283 --> 02:50:24.704]  But why did God give us consciousness?
[02:50:24.904 --> 02:50:26.284]  You know, there's evil in the universe.
[02:50:26.304 --> 02:50:26.964]  There's free will.
[02:50:27.285 --> 02:50:29.545]  Some will join evil and they'll hurt the innocent.
[02:50:29.585 --> 02:50:30.746]  I mean, you can't do that.
[02:50:30.766 --> 02:50:31.366]  You're a sadist.
[02:50:31.586 --> 02:50:32.887]  So instead, no one ever exists?
[02:50:34.987 --> 02:50:35.167]  No.
[02:50:36.148 --> 02:50:37.208]  But God isn't a hypocrite.
[02:50:37.228 --> 02:50:46.832]  So God concentrated himself down to a human and sent himself here to be tortured to death to show everybody, hey, I'll... anything I ask you to do, I'll do it.
[02:50:48.292 --> 02:50:50.213]  That's why you take that leap of faith towards God.
[02:50:50.773 --> 02:50:52.054]  God's waiting in this handout.
[02:50:52.881 --> 02:50:54.061]  Waiting right now for eternity.
[02:50:54.561 --> 02:50:56.782]  But you've got, Satan comes to take free will.
[02:50:57.182 --> 02:50:58.803]  God will not possess anybody.
[02:51:00.103 --> 02:51:01.843]  You've got to beg God to come into you.
[02:51:02.164 --> 02:51:07.365]  And God's so powerful, God's not just going to come in all the way at first because you couldn't handle it, I couldn't handle it.
[02:51:07.685 --> 02:51:11.286]  God's going to put weight on you and test you to make sure, do you really want this?
[02:51:12.726 --> 02:51:13.887]  While you're alive in this plane?
[02:51:13.907 --> 02:51:16.667]  Because when we're at the next level, we'll be a lot closer to God and be able to handle it.
[02:51:16.968 --> 02:51:21.649]  But you know, for those of us that have really asked God to come into us, are you really ready for that?
[02:51:22.568 --> 02:51:26.670]  Because these devil worshippers kill kids and do all this bad stuff so they can try to get close to darkness.
[02:51:28.291 --> 02:51:33.493]  They could never imagine the power, I mean you mean real power, of getting close to God.
[02:51:33.533 --> 02:51:36.214]  I mean it's just humbling to even be in the presence.
[02:51:36.254 --> 02:51:37.495]  You can't look at it.
[02:51:40.817 --> 02:51:42.477]  Because you're evil, you're lower level.
[02:51:42.517 --> 02:51:46.119]  You can't look at God because if you looked at God it would destroy you.
[02:51:46.519 --> 02:51:47.780]  Because you would kill yourself.
[02:51:50.253 --> 02:51:52.795]  Because you would be so ashamed of who you are.
[02:51:54.176 --> 02:51:55.537]  Here's my young, sweet daughter.
[02:51:56.278 --> 02:52:05.284]  I want you to hear the voice of purity that the enemy hates, the seed of the universe that the world wants to corrupt, so that we know the pole star of good versus evil.
[02:52:05.324 --> 02:52:05.665]  Here it is.
[02:52:05.685 --> 02:52:11.709]  Twinkle, twinkle.
[02:52:11.729 --> 02:52:12.130]  Twinkle.
[02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:14.832]  What's that?
[02:52:14.972 --> 02:52:15.592]  Record it for the air.
[02:52:15.612 --> 02:52:16.953]  Just say, say, say, twinkle, twinkle.
[02:52:16.973 --> 02:52:17.634]  Sing the song for him.
[02:52:17.654 --> 02:52:19.055]  Can you sing twinkle, twinkle for me?
[02:52:21.141 --> 02:52:28.910]  In the sky, how I wonder what you are.
[02:52:30.132 --> 02:52:40.465]  Up above the world so high, like a diamond in the sky.
[02:52:41.325 --> 02:52:53.352]  Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.
[02:52:53.972 --> 02:52:55.653]  Aww, you're so sweet.
[02:52:56.313 --> 02:52:57.854]  You are such a good singer.
[02:52:57.914 --> 02:52:58.835]  That was so pure.
[02:53:11.081 --> 02:53:13.164]  See the celebration of a child, their potential?
[02:53:14.326 --> 02:53:16.949]  So the globalists trying to sterilize kids when they're three now?
[02:53:17.430 --> 02:53:18.351]  Openly satanic.
[02:53:19.693 --> 02:53:22.977]  Because they're so empty, the only energy they have is sucking it off a child.
[02:53:23.738 --> 02:53:26.262]  These people will be damned to a black hole.
[02:53:29.451 --> 02:53:30.252]  The Absence of God.
[02:53:50.894 --> 02:53:55.998]  He was explaining all of this and I thought he was more powerful of the things he was saying today than what I was saying.
[02:53:56.378 --> 02:53:59.741]  So here he is on WLS out of Chicago, syndicated nationwide.
[02:53:59.761 --> 02:54:00.722]  Here's Mankow this morning.
[02:54:01.682 --> 02:54:03.544]  I say he's the most controversial guy in America.
[02:54:03.684 --> 02:54:04.725]  I don't know if he is or not.
[02:54:04.945 --> 02:54:05.545]  I think he is.
[02:54:05.965 --> 02:54:07.286]  One of the most controversial guys.
[02:54:07.407 --> 02:54:08.167]  Alex, how are you?
[02:54:09.268 --> 02:54:10.529]  Mankow, good to be here with you.
[02:54:11.089 --> 02:54:16.754]  Do you like being controversial or do you wish at this point you were just lovable Alex Jones?
[02:54:16.774 --> 02:54:18.275]  You could have taken the safe path.
[02:54:20.069 --> 02:54:20.549]  Well, I could have.
[02:54:20.569 --> 02:54:23.250]  Here's a great example for your listeners.
[02:54:23.270 --> 02:54:26.952]  23 years ago, I was simply reading a medical journal out of MIT.
[02:54:27.632 --> 02:54:32.754]  They were worried about Costa Rica and China and a few other places that were already creating animal-human clones.
[02:54:33.395 --> 02:54:34.875]  Now, that was in a major medical journal.
[02:54:35.516 --> 02:54:42.979]  Now, two years later, it was on CBS News that they have spider-part-goat creatures in upstate New York to create body armor.
[02:54:43.099 --> 02:54:44.139]  That was CBS News.
[02:54:44.900 --> 02:54:47.821]  Well, yesterday, AP and the London Independent
[02:54:48.522 --> 02:54:52.063]  Reported Japan just legalized animal-human clones.
[02:54:53.203 --> 02:54:56.504]  They already have in China babies being born that have five parents.
[02:54:56.844 --> 02:54:57.504]  Those aren't humans.
[02:54:57.544 --> 02:54:58.384]  Those are humanoids.
[02:54:59.264 --> 02:55:01.265]  So, I'm not really controversial.
[02:55:02.225 --> 02:55:06.145]  I point out stuff that's already going on, and then the media makes it controversial.
[02:55:06.185 --> 02:55:13.807]  I talked about Jeffrey Epstein and Robert Mueller using him as a confidential informant to blackmail people ten years ago.
[02:55:14.737 --> 02:55:16.458]  I had investigative journalists on all about it.
[02:55:16.498 --> 02:55:17.479]  Now it's all over the news.
[02:55:17.539 --> 02:55:26.805]  So really that's why they hate me, is because I have a big syndicated radio show just like you have had, and I'm able to put out things that are already out there.
[02:55:26.825 --> 02:55:30.468]  99% of what I cover is already public information.
[02:55:30.548 --> 02:55:33.570]  The other stuff, the 1%, was on DrugsReport.com yesterday.
[02:55:33.610 --> 02:55:39.354]  I know that's why you wanted me on, and that simply was showing Tim Cook of Apple
[02:55:40.146 --> 02:55:45.611]  And Elon Musk of Tesla, who wants everybody to have brain chips, he announced last week, but he says next year.
[02:55:45.871 --> 02:55:46.251]  That's right.
[02:55:46.271 --> 02:55:48.333]  They'll have kiosks where you can go to the mall.
[02:55:49.194 --> 02:55:51.095]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, Alex, Alex, you gotta hang on.
[02:55:51.896 --> 02:55:52.456]  I gotta break.
[02:55:52.476 --> 02:55:53.217]  I wanted to tease you.
[02:55:53.237 --> 02:55:53.717]  You know how it works.
[02:55:53.758 --> 02:55:54.959]  I gotta tease you and I'll bring you back.
[02:55:55.019 --> 02:55:58.582]  But there is something going on with the tech giant's eyes.
[02:55:59.482 --> 02:56:02.925]  They're amazingly, well, it's Shark Week, so let's use this reference.
[02:56:03.045 --> 02:56:03.726]  They're shark-like.
[02:56:04.827 --> 02:56:06.788]  They're all black and they're dead.
[02:56:07.859 --> 02:56:08.520]  What's going on?
[02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:09.921]  Alex Jones has a theory.
[02:56:10.121 --> 02:56:11.041]  We'll speak with him next.
[02:56:11.822 --> 02:56:16.285]  If you're easily offended, well, listen to another show for a few minutes.
[02:56:32.560 --> 02:56:35.181]  Link, and I heard what he said, because I knew what he was going to say when I hung up.
[02:56:35.521 --> 02:56:36.241]  He didn't get this from me.
[02:56:36.281 --> 02:56:36.741]  He knows.
[02:56:37.682 --> 02:56:39.322]  He was like inside Hollywood and got out of it.
[02:56:39.942 --> 02:56:44.344]  And he said, the children they don't kill, they turn into servants to pick up more kids that are like these Renfields.
[02:56:46.065 --> 02:56:50.066]  And that's what's going on, folks.
[02:56:50.106 --> 02:56:50.626]  This is real.
[02:56:50.686 --> 02:56:53.727]  This is psychic energy being drained off children.
[02:56:53.747 --> 02:56:58.529]  And if you don't fight this, you don't go to hell.
[02:56:59.454 --> 02:57:01.015]  What happens is you're damned.
[02:57:01.035 --> 02:57:03.016]  You're separate from God, as the Bible explains.
[02:57:03.556 --> 02:57:10.299]  These modern churches have all been taken over by Satan, because if you were going to be Satan, the first thing you do is take over the churches to make sure people understand.
[02:57:11.819 --> 02:57:13.640]  By being damned, it's separation from God.
[02:57:13.700 --> 02:57:26.386]  Can you imagine, as an intergalactic spirit that is in all these dimensions that can travel anywhere in the universe, you don't want to be with God, and so you're sent to a place, because you decided that, of your own people.
[02:57:26.926 --> 02:57:36.572]  Can you imagine with Bill Clinton, and Hillary, and Jeffrey Epstein, and Hitler, and Mao Tse-Tung, and, and, and all the, all the, like, enough, uh, with these people?
[02:57:37.092 --> 02:57:37.713]  Because here's the deal.
[02:57:38.093 --> 02:57:39.674]  They could create a whole new universe.
[02:57:39.734 --> 02:57:40.615]  They could build something.
[02:57:40.635 --> 02:57:41.055]  They can't.
[02:57:41.355 --> 02:57:42.276]  It's just raaaah!
[02:57:42.316 --> 02:57:45.938]  Killing each other, and flopping around, and just... There's no children to kill, though!
[02:57:45.998 --> 02:57:48.980]  You're all together, burning in your own evil.
[02:57:49.320 --> 02:57:50.701]  Burning in hell!
[02:57:52.619 --> 02:57:53.381]  It's happening now.
[02:57:54.123 --> 02:57:54.504]  Right now.
[02:57:55.225 --> 02:58:01.801]  All over the world, humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist, globalist, world government, Mark of the Beast agenda.
[02:58:03.248 --> 02:58:07.551]  The forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the spear, InfoWars, more than ever.
[02:58:08.312 --> 02:58:17.458]  Well, we're doing a special 40-hour broadcast to get new projects we've developed up and into orbit, and to take action at the next level.
[02:58:18.138 --> 02:58:24.483]  The globalists know we've already devastated them, and they hope that you don't take action, because when you support InfoWars, you change the world.
[02:58:25.303 --> 02:58:29.724]  Find coverage at clownworld.us and at infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:29.744 --> 02:58:40.207]  But whatever you do, join us during this special 40-hour broadcast that's happening right now and spread the word because that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech censors.
[02:58:40.547 --> 02:58:44.989]  Again, infowars.com forward slash show or clownworld.us.
[02:58:45.289 --> 02:58:45.909]  Please take action.
[02:58:53.812 --> 02:58:57.515]  Well today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[02:58:58.175 --> 02:59:03.019]  I just devoured your cousin InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[02:59:48.533 --> 02:59:55.221]  Not me.
[03:00:05.123 --> 03:00:05.843]  Big Brother.
[03:00:06.283 --> 03:00:07.504]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:08.084 --> 03:00:09.945]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:09.965 --> 03:00:11.425]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:11.685 --> 03:00:12.846]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.326 --> 03:00:19.028]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:19.088 --> 03:00:24.450]  Looking for adventure.
[03:00:25.330 --> 03:00:29.112]  Alright, let's go back to the Man Cow interview this morning that's so important.
[03:00:29.552 --> 03:00:31.533]  Dealing with the bottom of the rabbit hole with this whole thing.
[03:00:32.233 --> 03:00:32.573]  Here it is.
[03:00:38.467 --> 03:00:38.827]  See you tomorrow.
[03:00:59.500 --> 03:01:04.502]  Well, let's talk about the eyes, the creepy eyes of the tech leaders here in America.
[03:01:10.503 --> 03:01:15.485]  It was the most downloaded story on Drudge, Alex Jones, Controversial Kid.
[03:01:16.225 --> 03:01:18.246]  Alex, interesting stuff.
[03:01:18.346 --> 03:01:20.466]  What is going on with these tech giants' eyes?
[03:01:20.687 --> 03:01:23.547]  First of all, name the people and then say what you think is going on.
[03:01:25.168 --> 03:01:26.788]  Well, it's just a three minute video.
[03:01:26.848 --> 03:01:27.969]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:01:29.364 --> 03:01:32.886]  Anybody just typed into a search engine, what's wrong with Big Tech's eyes?
[03:01:33.386 --> 03:01:36.308]  You'll probably post it to your site, or you could even play it.
[03:01:36.768 --> 03:01:38.589]  It's actually about a two-minute total.
[03:01:39.409 --> 03:01:43.231]  And we just show Elon Musk's eyes under white lights on TV.
[03:01:43.751 --> 03:01:47.573]  We show his two chief engineers' eyes at the same event.
[03:01:47.613 --> 03:01:55.497]  We show Tim Cook in different interviews where he's under white lights, and his pupils are 90% dilated.
[03:01:55.517 --> 03:01:56.798]  That only happens when you're dead.
[03:01:57.965 --> 03:01:58.366]  I mean,
[03:02:13.860 --> 03:02:14.180]  It's just
[03:02:31.591 --> 03:02:52.816]  Microdosing on LSD, peyote, psilocybin, mushrooms, but they've also, Elon Musk came out three weeks ago with his brain interface, and it's not just a chip in the brain, it's six electrodes on the brain with a cell phone transmitter behind the ear, and then he says that this is so AI can take you over.
[03:02:53.336 --> 03:02:56.677]  So he says it won't happen right away, but that AI will take you over, that's a quote.
[03:02:57.796 --> 03:02:58.836]  And he's been starting next year.
[03:02:58.876 --> 03:03:03.457]  They won't just have Tesla kiosks at all the malls where you can see a Tesla car.
[03:03:03.837 --> 03:03:05.617]  You can go in, and they'll have a robot.
[03:03:06.018 --> 03:03:06.558]  I'm not kidding.
[03:03:06.578 --> 03:03:07.298]  There's video of this.
[03:03:08.998 --> 03:03:15.439]  Go in through your skull and put these electrodes in your brain, and it just takes an hour, and then now you are a wirehead.
[03:03:16.039 --> 03:03:18.500]  And so I'm asking, are they on super hardcore drugs?
[03:03:18.820 --> 03:03:19.660]  Because they're sweating.
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.261]  Their eyes are just, I mean, like they are on.
[03:03:22.541 --> 03:03:22.661]  Yeah.
[03:03:22.681 --> 03:03:23.981]  A little bit of acid might do this.
[03:03:24.281 --> 03:03:26.643]  Alex, let me interrupt you.
[03:03:26.983 --> 03:03:28.244]  Look, I know you're a god guy.
[03:03:28.384 --> 03:03:31.587]  I know you falter as I do, but this sounds like the mark of the beast.
[03:03:31.627 --> 03:03:33.268]  The microchipping of all humanity.
[03:03:33.308 --> 03:03:34.048]  This is frightening.
[03:03:34.329 --> 03:03:39.753]  And then you and I have talked about my trip into the jungles of Costa Rica with a team of doctors.
[03:03:39.873 --> 03:03:40.934]  I wouldn't do it without doctors.
[03:03:40.994 --> 03:03:41.834]  I did it with nurses.
[03:03:41.914 --> 03:03:43.295]  I mean, I had the money to do it right.
[03:03:43.355 --> 03:03:47.759]  I did ayahuasca, and I saw some of the clockwork elves and other things that these guys are into.
[03:03:48.459 --> 03:03:51.722]  Maybe they're tapping other dimensions with these drugs.
[03:03:52.903 --> 03:03:58.366]  I mean, I've just opened up about four hours worth of talk for you, but any thoughts on what I just said?
[03:03:59.547 --> 03:04:01.609]  Well, that is exactly what they say they're doing.
[03:04:01.669 --> 03:04:15.479]  And again, I was told this back when I was a kid, because my mom had a friend who worked for a private corporation that was really the CIA, and they had a psychedelic research institute in San Francisco that was doing IV drips of ayahuasca.
[03:04:16.098 --> 03:04:20.019]  And they were going in and mapping these other dimensions and communicating with these aliens.
[03:04:20.459 --> 03:04:25.621]  And so that's why when you went, uh, to where you went and did it, you noticed you all had a group hallucination.
[03:04:25.641 --> 03:04:27.521]  You saw them come from the edge of the forest.
[03:04:27.621 --> 03:04:29.482]  You all saw it together.
[03:04:29.502 --> 03:04:31.823]  Well, that's not a hallucination.
[03:04:31.863 --> 03:04:36.184]  That's what, that's called piercing the veil that all ancient religions understood.
[03:04:36.204 --> 03:04:39.205]  It's a veil that keeps you from seeing the spirit world.
[03:04:39.225 --> 03:04:43.406]  And that's what Mark Quarntee, who was the founder of the Michigan Militia,
[03:04:44.349 --> 03:04:47.630]  I used to go on his show 25 years ago, and I thought he was a little wild.
[03:04:47.690 --> 03:04:49.591]  He said, Alex, they're Satanists.
[03:04:49.731 --> 03:04:50.931]  They've given over their souls.
[03:04:51.111 --> 03:04:53.592]  Folks, we're going to be right back on the other side to finish this up.
[03:04:53.632 --> 03:04:55.152]  Then Mike Adams is taking over.
[03:04:55.172 --> 03:04:56.773]  I'm back.
[03:04:56.853 --> 03:04:57.373]  It's tomorrow.
[03:04:58.033 --> 03:05:03.055]  And then tonight, we've got coverage of the debates at 7 p.m., kicking off live and continuous coverage.
[03:05:03.797 --> 03:05:11.826]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:05:11.866 --> 03:05:18.994]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[03:05:19.234 --> 03:05:22.758]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[03:05:23.118 --> 03:05:23.398]  I think?
[03:05:38.075 --> 03:05:38.776]  It's expensive.
[03:05:38.836 --> 03:05:39.096]  Why?
[03:05:39.156 --> 03:05:41.658]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[03:05:41.938 --> 03:05:48.884]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support, and they came and they went.
[03:05:49.225 --> 03:05:51.927]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[03:05:52.287 --> 03:05:53.508]  It is the elite supplement.
[03:05:53.969 --> 03:05:57.592]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[03:05:57.632 --> 03:06:03.477]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:06:08.956 --> 03:06:10.977]  What's at the bottom of the globalist rabbit hole?
[03:06:11.317 --> 03:06:12.377]  Child sacrifice.
[03:06:12.637 --> 03:06:14.498]  Here's my report with Mankow this morning.
[03:06:27.993 --> 03:06:38.140]  Um, I remember being up close, I was in the front row, like 15 feet from her, and I remember her looking, she was in lights, I remember her looking and going, there's no pupil, it's pure shark eyes.
[03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:43.083]  So I haven't heard shark eyes since Mark Kornke said it, and you just finished the pieces earlier.
[03:06:43.263 --> 03:06:43.523]  Wow.
[03:06:43.583 --> 03:06:55.430]  He said they're soulless, they have shark eyes, and Kornke said, when they're demon possessed and have gone over the veil, they don't need drugs, they don't need wires, they are fully gone when you're totally demon possessed.
[03:06:55.751 --> 03:06:56.011]  Okay.
[03:06:56.917 --> 03:06:57.537]  Alex Jones.
[03:06:58.617 --> 03:06:59.318]  Michael Jackson.
[03:06:59.418 --> 03:07:00.958]  I spent several days with Michael Jackson.
[03:07:01.938 --> 03:07:05.659]  Before any of the pedophilia stuff came out, he was absolutely brilliant.
[03:07:06.479 --> 03:07:13.741]  I met him a year later at a Gavin convention that my producer, Love Cheese, ran in San Francisco, and he remembered everything from a year earlier.
[03:07:13.901 --> 03:07:16.981]  Well, wouldn't you think that I would remember more about the conversation with Michael Jackson?
[03:07:17.221 --> 03:07:17.781]  Not so.
[03:07:18.362 --> 03:07:19.462]  But his eyes were like that.
[03:07:19.582 --> 03:07:24.203]  They were absolutely... He had a charisma, but his eyes were absolutely death.
[03:07:25.103 --> 03:07:31.009]  It was, uh, and I couldn't stop looking at him, uh, and again, he was, there was nothing bad about him in the news.
[03:07:31.029 --> 03:07:34.212]  Uh, I just remember thinking, the eyes are dead.
[03:07:34.912 --> 03:07:35.533]  They're dead.
[03:07:36.654 --> 03:07:38.976]  Alex has told me many things, and I used to laugh at him.
[03:07:41.540 --> 03:07:45.304]  I would make fun of them, and then some of these things, many of them came to pass.
[03:07:45.524 --> 03:07:50.208]  I used to talk about the blimps that were spying on us, that you couldn't see, they were so high up in the sky.
[03:07:51.329 --> 03:07:54.071]  And I just thought it was the funniest damn knee slapper.
[03:07:54.252 --> 03:07:55.032]  Geez, do you remember this?
[03:07:55.152 --> 03:07:55.413]  Yeah.
[03:07:56.173 --> 03:07:56.594]  Come on.
[03:07:56.794 --> 03:07:59.797]  There's a network of blimps so far up we can't see them.
[03:08:00.978 --> 03:08:07.604]  And then one crash and the government had to admit, yeah, there's a network of blimps all over so far up that we can't see them, and they watch everything that we do.
[03:08:09.854 --> 03:08:12.216]  I've also been on this Epstein story for a long time.
[03:08:12.476 --> 03:08:28.285]  And I used to chocolate guys like Alex and so many of you that would call me and talk about pedophilia, the royal family, the Vatican, children's stars, children's charities that are all about funneling children to rich child rapers.
[03:08:29.986 --> 03:08:31.167]  And the satanic connection.
[03:08:31.567 --> 03:08:33.789]  I just thought it was the craziest thing.
[03:08:35.730 --> 03:08:36.450]  And now it's true.
[03:08:37.631 --> 03:08:38.972]  Epstein and the satanic temple.
[03:08:40.379 --> 03:08:42.801]  I'm going to ask Alex Jones about that next.
[03:08:43.021 --> 03:08:47.204]  This is the single biggest story on earth.
[03:08:48.765 --> 03:08:51.246]  How Biden's going to do tonight and all that, it's all nonsense.
[03:08:51.446 --> 03:08:52.327]  It's all smokescreen.
[03:08:52.367 --> 03:08:53.148]  It doesn't matter.
[03:08:53.988 --> 03:08:55.789]  There may be another gator in the lake.
[03:08:56.330 --> 03:08:57.230]  That's not the story.
[03:08:58.911 --> 03:09:07.277]  The story is the rich and powerful, both sides of the aisle, pedophilia and the satanic connection.
[03:09:08.735 --> 03:09:10.096]  That's next, I hope you can stay tuned.
[03:09:10.496 --> 03:09:14.438]  So Alex Jones, you don't shy away from the controversial stuff.
[03:09:14.579 --> 03:09:18.341]  What is the connection between all of these famous people?
[03:09:18.841 --> 03:09:22.764]  The names we've heard of Supreme Court Justice and who else?
[03:09:22.984 --> 03:09:28.347]  Stephen Hawking and Bill Richardson and top, and Clinton's of course, and top Democrats, top Republicans.
[03:09:28.847 --> 03:09:30.288]  Prince Andrew is the name I've heard.
[03:09:32.049 --> 03:09:34.491]  The Catholic Church, Children's Charity, Sandusky.
[03:09:35.411 --> 03:09:40.454]  What do they have in that satanic temple with all the satanic art that Epstein has?
[03:09:40.754 --> 03:09:45.156]  What is the connection between rich pedophiles and satanism, Alex?
[03:09:46.536 --> 03:09:52.419]  Everyone knows that different mafias have different initiation rituals.
[03:09:52.499 --> 03:09:54.660]  The Crips and Bloods, you have to kill another Crip or Blood.
[03:09:55.521 --> 03:09:59.503]  And, you know, other gangs, you gotta go kill an innocent person, a liquor store owner, an old lady.
[03:09:59.543 --> 03:10:02.104]  You have to do something bad they have on you.
[03:10:02.927 --> 03:10:18.196]  And so for thousands of years, you know, you read ancient texts about how certain corrupt societies would take over and the priests clash in every culture, from the Aztecs to the ancient Babylonians, it happened everywhere, would demand children be sacrificed.
[03:10:18.296 --> 03:10:19.957]  I mean, it's in every book of the Bible.
[03:10:20.477 --> 03:10:22.318]  They talk about child sacrifice.
[03:10:23.078 --> 03:10:23.819]  So this is history.
[03:10:24.059 --> 03:10:27.621]  And so what's happening is, it is a spiritual vampirism
[03:10:28.502 --> 03:10:32.084]  Where they are stealing the energy and innocence of the children.
[03:10:32.424 --> 03:10:33.965]  But that's only step one.
[03:10:34.606 --> 03:10:38.928]  That's how you get in the club, is that you have to rape small children.
[03:10:39.629 --> 03:10:43.571]  They start them out at 16, then it's 12-year-olds, then it's 10-year-olds, then it's 5-year-olds.
[03:10:43.991 --> 03:10:46.993]  And then, you're strangling and murdering 2-year-olds.
[03:10:47.033 --> 03:10:50.175]  That's their favorite, because they beg for mommy and are just in total horror.
[03:10:50.535 --> 03:10:54.378]  And they will torture a small child for three days until they use them up, is what they call it.
[03:10:54.718 --> 03:10:56.339]  This has come out when psychopaths do this.
[03:10:56.799 --> 03:10:57.980]  And the psychopaths always say,
[03:10:58.855 --> 03:11:00.497]  Oh, actually, I do this for Satan.
[03:11:00.557 --> 03:11:01.458]  Satan tortures me.
[03:11:01.518 --> 03:11:08.324]  I'm only happy when I'm torturing a tied-up woman or a small child, and then I use them up.
[03:11:08.364 --> 03:11:12.909]  So the demon in them is psychically draining the energy.
[03:11:13.409 --> 03:11:16.012]  And so we hear the legends of vampires in every culture.
[03:11:16.712 --> 03:11:19.295]  It's not that the vampire is real and lives forever.
[03:11:19.735 --> 03:11:21.237]  It's that the demonic spirit
[03:11:21.796 --> 03:11:22.177]  I don't know.
[03:11:32.874 --> 03:11:34.615]  I'm saying this is what they believe.
[03:11:34.635 --> 03:11:37.177]  Elon Musk has taken the drugs.
[03:11:37.217 --> 03:11:38.277]  He's been part of these groups.
[03:11:38.357 --> 03:11:44.040]  I don't want to say he's hurt kids, but he's told people, even in the Joe Rogan podcast, that it's interdimensional.
[03:11:44.361 --> 03:11:46.702]  Interdimensional demons are sucking energy of children.
[03:11:47.142 --> 03:11:49.603]  He warned people about it and they tried to crash his company.
[03:11:50.124 --> 03:11:53.986]  And then now he's come out and endorsed brain chips and world government.
[03:11:54.006 --> 03:11:55.107]  So that's what this is.
[03:11:55.347 --> 03:11:55.727]  Epstein
[03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:57.710]  Hot dogs are little boys.
[03:11:57.730 --> 03:11:59.231]  Slices of pizza are little girls.
[03:11:59.251 --> 03:12:00.311]  Is that right?
[03:12:20.629 --> 03:12:22.409]  Yeah, cheese pizza just means child porn.
[03:12:22.850 --> 03:12:24.050]  And that's in all the WikiLeaks.
[03:12:24.130 --> 03:12:34.612]  And so, we covered that and they then spun it with some pizza place that we didn't even talk about, which was Denison, so that the media would say, oh, look, there's no child pornography, there's no spirit cooking.
[03:12:34.952 --> 03:12:39.873]  And then they created that whole canard that, oh, there's no pedophilia, it's all made up by Alex Jones.
[03:12:40.253 --> 03:12:44.014]  They created a fake story, said that we were the ones reporting it.
[03:12:44.594 --> 03:12:47.095]  Kind of like, remember how Karl Rove famously added
[03:12:48.164 --> 03:12:48.724]  Ah, man.
[03:13:07.335 --> 03:13:08.937]  Brother, there's so much in what you just said.
[03:13:09.498 --> 03:13:12.261]  It's such horrific stuff and it's a dark energy.
[03:13:12.902 --> 03:13:16.026]  They talked about it last night at the Democratic Convention.
[03:13:16.046 --> 03:13:17.048]  It is a dark energy.
[03:13:17.468 --> 03:13:18.269]  It is a power.
[03:13:19.090 --> 03:13:22.234]  Love and God and I believe Christ beat it.
[03:13:22.915 --> 03:13:23.615]  Christ wins.
[03:13:23.875 --> 03:13:24.676]  I've read the end of the book.
[03:13:24.736 --> 03:13:25.336]  God wins.
[03:13:25.396 --> 03:13:25.976]  Good wins.
[03:13:26.396 --> 03:13:27.717]  It's tougher to stay on the good side.
[03:13:27.877 --> 03:13:29.217]  I'm telling you, it isn't easy.
[03:13:29.917 --> 03:13:36.359]  But these people have taken the easy route, and they do have money and power and fame in this lifetime.
[03:13:36.419 --> 03:13:38.780]  But boy, do they have to pay for it for an eternity.
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:44.942]  I loved all the mainstream people looking at Epstein's pedophile island, where Clinton liked to hang out.
[03:13:46.295 --> 03:13:48.618]  And I don't believe that Bill Clinton's a pedophile, by the way.
[03:13:48.658 --> 03:13:55.845]  I do think, in my opinion, he was dating the pimp that rounded up the children, the woman that lives in one of the Trump buildings.
[03:13:55.865 --> 03:13:57.687]  I think she lives in Trump Tower in New York.
[03:14:00.626 --> 03:14:01.447]  You should see the artwork.
[03:14:01.487 --> 03:14:02.467]  I mean, it's all for Satan.
[03:14:02.488 --> 03:14:03.308]  It's all demonic.
[03:14:03.508 --> 03:14:04.909]  And yeah, yeah.
[03:14:05.230 --> 03:14:07.692]  It's awesome, but a honey trap, they call it.
[03:14:07.832 --> 03:14:10.214]  It's like the Godfather, where they blackmail that politician.
[03:14:10.754 --> 03:14:11.375]  They get you in there.
[03:14:11.395 --> 03:14:12.355]  You want to go to the next level?
[03:14:12.576 --> 03:14:13.316]  There's the kid.
[03:14:13.616 --> 03:14:13.937]  Do it.
[03:14:16.199 --> 03:14:19.141]  But they're also doing it for dark reasons.
[03:14:20.122 --> 03:14:23.885]  Eyes wide shut is what these... If you've ever seen the movie Eyes Wide Shut, that's what these parties are like.
[03:14:27.980 --> 03:14:29.181]  It's all interconnected.
[03:14:29.221 --> 03:14:29.941]  The giant owl.
[03:14:29.961 --> 03:14:31.322]  What's the owl that they worship?
[03:14:31.842 --> 03:14:32.703]  The demonic thing?
[03:14:33.243 --> 03:14:35.764]  Well, there's the goat-headed figure.
[03:14:35.824 --> 03:14:36.164]  What else?
[03:14:36.284 --> 03:14:37.025]  Where else are they getting?
[03:14:37.345 --> 03:14:38.325]  It's scalar waves.
[03:14:38.385 --> 03:14:40.627]  Listen, and how do you fight this dark energy?
[03:14:41.907 --> 03:14:42.928]  It's all scalar waves.
[03:14:42.988 --> 03:14:49.251]  I don't even know how to explain it in a stupid radio show, but you can fight back with prayer.
[03:14:49.531 --> 03:14:52.573]  You can fight evil forces coming against you with prayer.
[03:14:54.034 --> 03:14:59.380]  Yes, they use demonic things, and it's an energy, but you can use a good energy.
[03:15:01.543 --> 03:15:02.504]  Alex, I'm out of time.
[03:15:02.524 --> 03:15:03.125]  I've got to break.
[03:15:03.325 --> 03:15:05.608]  Do you want to wrap it up for me and put a nice little bow on it?
[03:15:06.997 --> 03:15:10.959]  Well, Mangel, I think you just put a bow on it, and everybody knows there's good and evil.
[03:15:11.519 --> 03:15:16.842]  The church has been taken over, that's why people turned away from it, because the devil's taken control of most of the churches, but you just said it.
[03:15:17.182 --> 03:15:20.284]  There is dark energy, there is light energy, there is God, and there is the devil.
[03:15:20.584 --> 03:15:28.828]  And children represent the potential of the universe, the potential of the human destiny, and that's why Satan wants to destroy that more than anything, that's why we must
[03:15:29.608 --> 03:15:35.392]  Check the children, like Christ said, better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself in the ocean than to hurt one of mine.
[03:15:35.692 --> 03:15:36.512]  And so you've said it.
[03:15:36.833 --> 03:15:39.895]  We're covering it all at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:15:40.175 --> 03:15:41.816]  The eyes have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:15:42.056 --> 03:15:47.960]  Look into their dead eyes and make sure you get on the right side of eternity, just like Mankow just said.
[03:15:48.460 --> 03:15:49.220]  Well, thanks, brother.
[03:15:50.201 --> 03:15:51.102]  Yeah, it is something.
[03:15:51.422 --> 03:15:51.822]  It is something.
[03:15:51.842 --> 03:15:54.484]  All right, Mike Adams has taken over, and then next he says,
[03:15:56.187 --> 03:15:57.288]  That's a man cow.
[03:15:57.308 --> 03:15:59.030]  When I come back, I'll tell you what happens to children they don't kill.
[03:15:59.350 --> 03:16:01.291]  They use them to entice and recruit the other children.
[03:16:02.492 --> 03:16:11.420]  Google's manipulation of votes gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton in the year 2016.
[03:16:11.880 --> 03:16:13.241]  Is that correct?
[03:16:13.962 --> 03:16:17.065]  2.6 million is a rock-bottom minimum.
[03:16:17.805 --> 03:16:28.576]  The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes, depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that I've been studying.
[03:16:28.836 --> 03:16:33.300]  They control these, and no one can counteract them.
[03:16:33.340 --> 03:16:35.042]  These are not competitive.
[03:16:35.823 --> 03:16:40.587]  These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.
[03:16:41.709 --> 03:16:51.351]  Your testimony is that Google is, through bias in search results, manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of.
[03:16:52.034 --> 03:17:08.245]  On a massive scale, in 2020, if all these companies are supporting the same candidate, there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.
[03:17:08.825 --> 03:17:13.288]  Without monitoring systems in place, we'll never know what these companies are doing.
[03:17:13.568 --> 03:17:14.549]  And in 2020, you can bet
[03:17:18.362 --> 03:17:26.204]  That all of these companies are going to go all out, and the methods that they're using are invisible.
[03:17:26.284 --> 03:17:27.484]  They're subliminal.
[03:17:27.824 --> 03:17:35.686]  They're more powerful than most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences, and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years.
[03:17:35.706 --> 03:17:44.967]  A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, collectively.
[03:17:46.028 --> 03:17:46.848]  Massively
[03:17:47.888 --> 03:17:50.552]  Influencing the results of elections.
[03:17:50.952 --> 03:17:53.175]  Senator, with respect, I must correct you.
[03:17:53.195 --> 03:17:53.535]  Please.
[03:17:53.856 --> 03:18:00.644]  If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a go-vote reminder just to Democrats on Election Day, that doesn't cost him a dime.
[03:18:08.231 --> 03:18:11.076]  Nicole in New Jersey wants to talk about GMOs and allergies.
[03:18:11.356 --> 03:18:12.638]  Awesome, thanks for taking my call.
[03:18:12.718 --> 03:18:18.648]  I love InfoWars and what you guys do there, so thank you and the rest of the crew for keeping us up to date with the truth and facts.
[03:18:18.748 --> 03:18:20.812]  Keeping your amygdalas not enlarged.
[03:18:23.296 --> 03:18:24.236]  We're trying, we're trying.
[03:18:24.336 --> 03:18:27.638]  So in New Jersey it's really terrible and I have really, really bad allergies.
[03:18:27.698 --> 03:18:36.464]  So what I want to tell Alex, thank you so much for getting the Alexa Pure Breathe that has truly saved my life and has given me the ability to not have sinus infections anymore.
[03:18:36.564 --> 03:18:44.269]  So if anybody out there is listening and needs to breathe again and sleep right and not have multiple sinus infections, go for the Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:18:44.369 --> 03:18:45.991]  Wow, so you keep it in your bedroom?
[03:18:46.191 --> 03:18:47.652]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, I do.
[03:18:47.812 --> 03:18:52.096]  And I have a couple that I'll be getting for my mom and dad, and then one for my son and his girlfriend.
[03:18:52.196 --> 03:18:54.438]  And New Jersey is just so air polluted, it's disgusting.
[03:18:54.458 --> 03:19:03.707]  I actually live not far from Lockheed Martin, so there was a lot of, like, lawsuits and stuff that went on when our neighborhood was built about the water and possible contaminants in the water.
[03:19:03.727 --> 03:19:09.132]  So it's actually a backwards way of how I found InfoWorth, was looking on a natural way to kill my pirates.
[03:19:09.312 --> 03:19:12.593]  And so the Selenium is actually what introduced me to InfoWars.
[03:19:12.613 --> 03:19:14.394]  I was like, where have you guys been my whole life?
[03:19:14.474 --> 03:19:16.775]  So it was definitely a bonus find.
[03:19:17.075 --> 03:19:18.496]  All right, Nicole, thanks for calling.
[03:19:18.516 --> 03:19:21.337]  We appreciate your support and everything else.
[03:19:21.637 --> 03:19:23.437]  And I might pick up one of those air cleaners.
[03:19:23.457 --> 03:19:24.938]  I have one at my desk, actually.
[03:19:25.018 --> 03:19:26.699]  So maybe I should get one for my house.
[03:19:26.739 --> 03:19:28.720]  Maybe that would help in my bedroom.
[03:19:35.951 --> 03:19:38.994]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[03:19:39.154 --> 03:19:42.197]  Now, we're bringing you an all-new version to help you reach your energy peak.
[03:19:42.377 --> 03:19:49.704]  Ultra 12 from InfoWars Live takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[03:19:49.864 --> 03:19:56.290]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[03:19:56.431 --> 03:20:00.134]  Take advantage of the superior form of B12 and head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:20:06.129 --> 03:20:17.457]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.697 --> 03:20:24.482]  Live from Austin, Texas, Mike Adams of naturalnews.com is about to take over on the fourth hour of The E!
[03:20:34.173 --> 03:20:36.633]  But first, one of the new articles on Infowars.com.
[03:20:37.674 --> 03:20:41.134]  London puts up signs telling Islamists don't defecate in the streets.
[03:20:42.355 --> 03:20:51.076]  When you import the third world, or the old world, and don't encourage them to adopt the West, well, you get signs going up in London telling people not to crap in the streets.
[03:20:52.116 --> 03:20:58.998]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, we have signs up at the gas stations here in Texas saying, put your toilet paper in the toilet, not in the corner.
[03:20:59.718 --> 03:21:00.738]  And they're calling those racist.
[03:21:02.102 --> 03:21:05.024]  So this is what's happening, ladies and gentlemen, the suicide of the West.
[03:21:05.464 --> 03:21:07.206]  Mike Adams takes over the rest of the hour.
[03:21:07.266 --> 03:21:08.226]  We really appreciate him.
[03:21:08.647 --> 03:21:09.607]  And then continual coverage.
[03:21:09.627 --> 03:21:10.428]  I'll be back tonight.
[03:21:11.584 --> 03:21:14.426]  With the Clown World 2, it should be a lot bigger fireworks.
[03:21:14.446 --> 03:21:15.848]  I'll tell you, last night was like drying paint.
[03:21:16.468 --> 03:21:18.029]  They're going to take our guns, everything's free.
[03:21:18.069 --> 03:21:18.710]  We already knew that.
[03:21:18.730 --> 03:21:19.411]  It was all scripted.
[03:21:19.451 --> 03:21:21.612]  But tonight, the long knives are out for Joe Biden.
[03:21:21.953 --> 03:21:24.715]  Mike Adams has two giant breaking stories at naturalnews.com.
[03:21:25.456 --> 03:21:30.440]  Please spread the articles also in video at a link that isn't censored, clownworld.us.
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:35.744]  We've got the Houston airport dubbing sewage reportedly right into the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:21:36.285 --> 03:21:37.846]  And we have Glyphosate and beer.
[03:21:37.926 --> 03:21:38.847]  Mike Adams takes over.
[03:21:40.376 --> 03:21:40.956]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:21:41.036 --> 03:21:42.397]  It's great to join you here today.
[03:21:42.417 --> 03:21:45.518]  Yeah, I've got an exclusive story breaking it right here on your show.
[03:21:45.818 --> 03:21:48.039]  The article is not up yet on this.
[03:21:48.059 --> 03:21:50.420]  This is an exclusive InfoWars breaking story.
[03:21:51.221 --> 03:22:02.446]  The International Airport in Houston, Texas, and we have confirmed now through our sources, is dumping raw sewage directly into the storm drains going into the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:22:02.466 --> 03:22:09.849]  And this is raw sewage that is siphoned off the airplanes that arrive into Houston from all over the world.
[03:22:10.538 --> 03:22:33.444]  So, you know how San Francisco, of course, is flushing raw human feces of San Francisco into the San Francisco Bay, but in Houston, Texas, the Houston International Airport, again, just to confirm, is dumping the raw feces of people from all over the world into the storm drains, which are flushed directly into the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:22:33.464 --> 03:22:38.665]  So, no wonder we have record cases in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida of flesh-eating bacteria.
[03:22:39.795 --> 03:22:40.395]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:22:40.435 --> 03:22:45.217]  This is exactly why it contaminates all the beaches along the entire Gulf of Mexico.
[03:22:45.737 --> 03:23:01.582]  Now, regulations of the City of Houston require this airport waste, which is, you know, raw human feces, feminine hygiene products, whatever you could imagine that people might flush a toilet on an international flight, which could include, you know, illicit drugs too, whatever.
[03:23:02.262 --> 03:23:07.204]  All of this is supposed to go into the sewage treatment system of the city of Houston.
[03:23:07.544 --> 03:23:10.404]  Instead, it is being dumped directly into the storm drain.
[03:23:10.444 --> 03:23:11.345]  Well, this is intriguing.
[03:23:11.365 --> 03:23:12.565]  I appreciate you breaking this here.
[03:23:12.605 --> 03:23:14.106]  I know you're meticulous with your sources.
[03:23:14.486 --> 03:23:15.986]  I'm going to shut up now, but I'm going to be watching.
[03:23:16.906 --> 03:23:19.347]  I guess you obviously got sources confirming this is going on.
[03:23:19.367 --> 03:23:20.167]  This is wild.
[03:23:21.708 --> 03:23:22.488]  Yeah, this is absolutely...
[03:23:24.935 --> 03:23:29.079]  These are aware of this inside the airport and they are completely freaking out about it.
[03:23:29.699 --> 03:23:31.041]  The media has not covered this.
[03:23:31.301 --> 03:23:32.622]  No one has covered this story.
[03:23:32.642 --> 03:23:34.664]  That's why this is an exclusive for InfoWars.
[03:23:34.684 --> 03:23:39.188]  So I guess they pull over, you know, they pump it out in the trucks and then I guess they just go to a gutter and dump it in?
[03:23:40.527 --> 03:23:42.028]  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening, right.
[03:23:42.768 --> 03:23:59.674]  These trucks, they come up to the airplanes after the planes land, they siphon off all of the toilet waste, and then they're supposed to take it and process it and dump it into the sewage system, the city sewage system, which has some treatment, of course, but instead they're dumping it into the storm drains.
[03:24:00.214 --> 03:24:05.416]  And just like in San Francisco and Los Angeles, storm drains are not treated sewage systems.
[03:24:06.136 --> 03:24:08.380]  And those go out to local creeks, you name it.
[03:24:08.400 --> 03:24:12.465]  So bottom line here, international bio-waste is coming in.
[03:24:12.485 --> 03:24:20.055]  Obviously whoever's managing this, the company that's doing it, is cutting a corner and they're dumping it right into the storm drains.
[03:24:20.075 --> 03:24:20.997]  This is outrageous.
[03:24:22.403 --> 03:24:31.789]  Yes, and look, you know Alex, I've lived in South America, I've lived in Ecuador, I've lived in Asia, I've lived in third world countries and I've toured third world countries.
[03:24:31.849 --> 03:24:33.150]  I've seen extreme poverty.
[03:24:33.710 --> 03:24:42.416]  I've never seen anything as insane as what I'm describing here with the Houston International Airport and also what's happening in the streets of San Francisco.
[03:24:42.856 --> 03:24:48.399]  It is beneath a third world country what liberals have done to their liberal cities in California.
[03:24:48.419 --> 03:24:50.681]  Well it's funny because Houston is one of the most liberal cities in the country.
[03:24:51.201 --> 03:24:58.630]  They're pedophiles that lead child events at public schools there and everywhere they go they just cut out the basic services and they keep the money.
[03:24:58.650 --> 03:25:05.198]  In fact, I was told by Homeland Security in a private meeting and others that Houston now openly is a major pedophile destination.
[03:25:05.238 --> 03:25:07.721]  It's been legalized there by the folks running things.
[03:25:08.973 --> 03:25:09.933]  Well, I'm not surprised.
[03:25:10.253 --> 03:25:12.034]  But here's the upshot of all of this, Alex.
[03:25:12.494 --> 03:25:19.116]  If we want to save the environment, we have to defeat Democrats and put conservatives in charge.
[03:25:19.436 --> 03:25:23.458]  Because conservatives will practice conservation of the environment.
[03:25:23.498 --> 03:25:27.359]  I was about to say, how does Marianne Williamson say Trump's the one that caused Flint?
[03:25:29.574 --> 03:25:30.814]  No, it's insane.
[03:25:30.854 --> 03:25:43.259]  You look at the liberal policies, they're the ones polluting the beaches and covering beaches with filth and feces, to the point where we're going to have now the rise of bubonic plague in Los Angeles, even according to Dr. Drew recently, the celebrity doctor.
[03:25:43.279 --> 03:25:43.679]  That's right.
[03:25:43.759 --> 03:25:58.844]  And you've got the rise of other diseases, E. coli, and even cholera is likely to make a comeback in places like California, and now even the beaches in Texas, because, think about it, you take the raw human sewage of people flying in from South America, or flying in from Europe,
[03:25:59.424 --> 03:26:06.252]  Or even from Asia, direct flights to Houston that go through customs there, and all that feces is being dumped directly into the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:26:06.272 --> 03:26:10.216]  Oh, I won't go to the northern Gulf of Mexico, or the northern part of Texas.
[03:26:10.656 --> 03:26:19.186]  The last time I was there, I had a tiny cut on my leg, and I got flesh-eating bacteria, and it got inside, and when I went to the doctor, finally, pus was pouring out a week later.
[03:26:19.226 --> 03:26:21.048]  They said, you could lose your whole leg.
[03:26:22.267 --> 03:26:23.067]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:26:23.107 --> 03:26:25.348]  It's not safe because of these practices.
[03:26:25.408 --> 03:26:30.591]  And then we're lectured every day by Democrats who say, oh, Trump is destroying the world.
[03:26:30.671 --> 03:26:30.931]  Really?
[03:26:31.371 --> 03:26:36.393]  Have you Democrats looked at your own filth-infested, rat-infested cities?
[03:26:36.673 --> 03:26:44.397]  Have you looked at the environmental impact of allowing people to just literally crap all over the streets of San Francisco and have that flushed into the ocean?
[03:26:44.857 --> 03:26:48.699]  Have you looked at the level of E. coli and human feces on the beaches of California?
[03:26:48.719 --> 03:26:50.860]  I mean, it's the perfect metaphor
[03:26:51.545 --> 03:26:53.206]  For what liberals do to their cities.
[03:26:53.266 --> 03:26:54.546]  They destroy everything they run.
[03:26:55.146 --> 03:26:57.947]  They do not... Because they siphon all the services money off of it.
[03:26:57.987 --> 03:27:04.189]  Since you mentioned it, here's Elijah Cummings, a decade ago, saying that Baltimore is infested, but now that's evil to say.
[03:27:05.349 --> 03:27:19.353]  This morning, I left my community of Baltimore, a drug-infested area, where a lot of the drugs that we're talking about today have already taken the lives of so many children.
[03:27:20.854 --> 03:27:30.384]  The same children that I watched 14 or 15 years ago as they grew up, now walking around like zombies.
[03:27:30.404 --> 03:27:31.505]  This is only 40 miles away.
[03:27:31.905 --> 03:27:33.046]  That's everything Trump says.
[03:27:33.086 --> 03:27:33.927]  I said 10 years ago.
[03:27:33.987 --> 03:27:35.068]  That's 20 years ago, Mike Adams.
[03:27:35.088 --> 03:27:37.271]  You take over, but I mean, you're spot on about this.
[03:27:38.240 --> 03:27:40.182]  Well, I've got another breaking story to cover here, too.
[03:27:40.202 --> 03:27:46.387]  I will go into detail on the other side of this upcoming break, which is the media hoax about glyphosate in beer.
[03:27:46.787 --> 03:27:59.537]  Turns out, Alex, check this out, you would have to drink, we did the math, we did the test, you would have to drink 41,000 liters of beer to have the same level of exposure as just dropping a few drops of glyphosate concentrate on your skin.
[03:28:00.138 --> 03:28:05.442]  So, the beer glyphosate... So, it's a great distraction to say, oh, it's in your beer, don't worry, it's, you know, somebody will also want my beer.
[03:28:07.065 --> 03:28:09.746]  Yeah, we've released the results.
[03:28:09.906 --> 03:28:11.366]  It's really not in your beer.
[03:28:11.706 --> 03:28:13.327]  We tested 26 popular beers.
[03:28:13.567 --> 03:28:17.188]  We found almost zero glyphosate in all the beers.
[03:28:17.528 --> 03:28:18.608]  And again, we did the math.
[03:28:18.628 --> 03:28:22.810]  You'd have to drink 41,000 liters of beer to have the same exposure.
[03:28:23.430 --> 03:28:26.731]  So they're baiting and switching with this huge ruling against them.
[03:28:28.124 --> 03:28:29.366]  Uh, exactly, exactly.
[03:28:29.386 --> 03:28:32.931]  I'm going to give you the details to your audience here on the other side of this comic break and I've got more on Alex.
[03:28:32.951 --> 03:28:38.618]  Folks, everybody listening, tell them to tune in right now to InfoWars.com forward slash show, NaturalNews.com.
[03:28:38.979 --> 03:28:41.662]  This is important stuff and only you can get around the sensors.
[03:28:42.043 --> 03:28:43.565]  This is the live 40 hour broadcast.
[03:28:44.466 --> 03:28:46.487]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we're going to have the War Room.
[03:28:46.947 --> 03:28:48.948]  We've got Robert Barnes here, Paul Watson coming up.
[03:28:49.028 --> 03:28:51.169]  So much more tonight and live coverage.
[03:28:51.189 --> 03:28:54.451]  It should be a lot bigger this evening with the knives coming out for Joe Biden.
[03:28:54.471 --> 03:28:57.973]  It's all straight ahead, but only you, seriously, can override the sensors.
[03:28:58.073 --> 03:28:59.994]  Infowars.com, Ford's live show.
[03:29:09.660 --> 03:29:12.342]  The most banned network in the world.
[03:29:12.402 --> 03:29:21.448]  You see Pelosi acting like she's dissing herself from AOC, but that's really the globalist policies AOC just does in a ham-pissed way and lies when she gets caught.
[03:29:22.869 --> 03:29:25.891]  And so, they're trying to act like, oh, you know, the party split.
[03:29:26.491 --> 03:29:31.575]  And I was watching different Democrats on Fox News this morning saying, we all need to come together and be more centrist.
[03:29:31.615 --> 03:29:34.036]  No, the truth is, Republicans have tried to be centrist.
[03:29:34.056 --> 03:29:35.637]  We get drug along and their left is garbage.
[03:29:35.958 --> 03:29:38.940]  And the left now has just run away like a fish with a line.
[03:29:39.600 --> 03:29:41.522]  In the most extreme insanity.
[03:29:41.542 --> 03:29:44.704]  And so the media is spreading it like, we all need to be less extreme.
[03:29:45.825 --> 03:29:48.147]  Conservatives and Christians and people, we're not extreme.
[03:29:48.408 --> 03:29:49.789]  We're promoting stuff that works.
[03:29:50.029 --> 03:29:50.990]  That's tried and true.
[03:29:51.170 --> 03:29:54.753]  Like family and property and the right to defense and borders.
[03:29:54.973 --> 03:30:03.400]  And then they're meanwhile saying, there's hundreds of genders and pedophilia's good and world government's good and open borders are good and America sucks.
[03:30:03.520 --> 03:30:05.122]  And then we're like, okay, what's the alternative?
[03:30:05.302 --> 03:30:07.804]  It's just these people, I don't know how they got so whacked out.
[03:30:08.004 --> 03:30:15.207]  Well, I think, I've brought this up too, how the left is going insane and I've had people say, well, everybody's a little bit more polarized and etc, etc.
[03:30:15.448 --> 03:30:16.628]  They've actually done studies.
[03:30:16.688 --> 03:30:19.590]  They track the trends of political opinions in the U.S.
[03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:28.294]  and they can prove with data that over the past few decades, the right-wing conservatives, Republican Party, they've remained pretty consistent, right?
[03:30:28.314 --> 03:30:34.897]  Someone who identifies as right-wing now is going to have a lot of common ground with someone who identified right-wing, let's say, 20, 30 years ago.
[03:30:37.458 --> 03:30:39.219]  The case is not the same for the left wing.
[03:30:39.239 --> 03:30:43.520]  They actually have demonstrably gone further left than they ever have been.
[03:30:43.540 --> 03:30:46.741]  I mean, we see this with even people like Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer.
[03:30:47.061 --> 03:30:53.683]  You know, there are tapes of Barack Obama of them, you know, maybe 10 years ago talking about the importance of securing the border.
[03:30:53.723 --> 03:30:56.164]  They're not saying that kind of stuff anymore.
[03:30:56.724 --> 03:31:04.026]  One of the only positive things I can say about AOC is I think she is so far left that even Nancy Pelosi and people like that are starting to say, okay,
[03:31:04.686 --> 03:31:08.128]  Maybe we need to slow things down a little bit.
[03:31:08.528 --> 03:31:17.811]  That's honestly the only hope I think the Democrats have right now because I think among a very small base of people, these far-left progressives, people like AOC are great.
[03:31:17.851 --> 03:31:18.512]  They're amazing.
[03:31:18.812 --> 03:31:23.214]  But I think Democratic Party needs to realize that America in general is not woke Twitter.
[03:31:23.254 --> 03:31:26.475]  They need to stop pandering to these people or else they're gonna feel it in elections.
[03:31:34.102 --> 03:31:35.823]  Laura in Alabama.
[03:31:35.904 --> 03:31:36.884]  Laura, you're on the air.
[03:31:36.944 --> 03:31:37.305]  Go ahead.
[03:31:37.425 --> 03:31:37.865]  Hi, Alex.
[03:31:38.065 --> 03:31:43.509]  I wanted to let you know, first of all, that I do pray for you in Newport Ward and the president every single day.
[03:31:43.790 --> 03:31:49.194]  And I've now decided to increase my support for you guys and order even more each month.
[03:31:49.254 --> 03:31:51.516]  My favorite products are the Silverwood Gel.
[03:31:51.736 --> 03:31:52.897]  Use it on everything.
[03:31:52.997 --> 03:31:54.578]  Cut, scrape, burn, you name it.
[03:31:54.638 --> 03:31:55.999]  The Super Blue Toothpaste.
[03:31:56.039 --> 03:31:56.439]  Love it.
[03:31:56.579 --> 03:31:58.361]  And my most favorite is TurboForce.
[03:31:58.421 --> 03:32:00.222]  Just great energy with no crash.
[03:32:00.342 --> 03:32:02.924]  And I do have it on auto shift, so don't forget.
[03:32:02.944 --> 03:32:03.785]  I think that's important for me.
[03:32:03.985 --> 03:32:17.029]  Well, thank you for your kind words, because take that wound gel.
[03:32:17.089 --> 03:32:18.849]  We're the only other company in the U.S.
[03:32:19.009 --> 03:32:23.130]  that has licensed it from the Colorado company that's very famous, that has FDA approval.
[03:32:23.290 --> 03:32:31.833]  It's used in hospitals, it's sold in pharmacies, and then we private label it as Silver Wound Gel, which is a pre-gel, tiny bit, covers your hands, everything.
[03:32:32.273 --> 03:32:36.175]  And then disinfects all day long or put it on once you have a cut or something.
[03:32:36.215 --> 03:32:39.658]  Now, it's so super strong, you can't take it internally or it's poisonous.
[03:32:39.798 --> 03:32:43.800]  But yes, it is the strongest FDA over-the-counter silver there is.
[03:32:43.860 --> 03:32:45.301]  So that is one of our best sellers.
[03:32:45.321 --> 03:32:46.262]  People absolutely love it.
[03:32:46.442 --> 03:32:46.742]  Thank you.
[03:32:46.882 --> 03:32:49.424]  And I can tell you this, my neighbor burned his finger a little bit.
[03:32:49.444 --> 03:32:53.006]  We're building a fire outside and I ran inside and got it and put it on his finger.
[03:32:53.046 --> 03:32:56.188]  And he said to me, is this supposed to work instantly and like this?
[03:32:56.388 --> 03:32:57.489]  And I said, yes, sure does.
[03:32:57.589 --> 03:32:59.390]  So it's fantastic stuff.
[03:32:59.450 --> 03:33:00.490]  I highly recommend it.
[03:33:06.093 --> 03:33:20.678]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.119 --> 03:33:22.999]  You found it.
[03:33:23.339 --> 03:33:24.840]  The tip of the spear.
[03:33:25.380 --> 03:33:29.942]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:33:34.020 --> 03:33:47.768]  I want to emphasize how insane it is that we have confirmed again that the International Airport in Houston, Texas is dumping raw sewage into the storm drains that empty into the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:33:48.689 --> 03:33:57.454]  And we have it from a number of high-level sources with security access there in the airport on the tarmac.
[03:33:58.451 --> 03:34:06.149]  And what we're asking, for those of you who are listening who may work at the Houston Airport, this is the IAH International Airport.
[03:34:06.169 --> 03:34:08.555]  I think it's called the George Bush Intercontinental Airport.
[03:34:10.001 --> 03:34:13.783]  We need some photos of what's happening.
[03:34:14.243 --> 03:34:27.589]  And so if you are on the ground there and you have any ability to get additional photos that we can add to our sources that are confirming this, this could be a huge bombshell breaking story.
[03:34:27.649 --> 03:34:36.953]  So if you work at that airport and can take photos there without risking your job, which may be difficult, may be impossible,
[03:34:37.817 --> 03:34:43.802]  We need your help to blow the lid on this story and stop the mass pollution of the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:34:44.662 --> 03:34:49.886]  This explains why there's so much feces on the beaches of Texas.
[03:34:50.827 --> 03:34:52.548]  Beaches all around the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:34:52.568 --> 03:35:00.814]  This will be impacting beaches in Louisiana and even the west coast of Florida to some extent and of course parts of Mexico as well.
[03:35:01.435 --> 03:35:03.136]  This practice must be stopped.
[03:35:03.823 --> 03:35:05.645]  The media is not reporting this.
[03:35:06.206 --> 03:35:08.468]  There's zero coverage from any other source.
[03:35:08.508 --> 03:35:09.729]  This is exclusively here.
[03:35:10.350 --> 03:35:13.873]  Mike Adams bringing you this news from InfoWars.com.
[03:35:14.354 --> 03:35:17.297]  And it is real, it is happening, and it must be stopped.
[03:35:17.357 --> 03:35:26.907]  And it shows the ecological devastation that's being allowed to take place by liberal cities with liberal mayors all across our country.
[03:35:27.427 --> 03:35:29.688]  And you ask, why is Baltimore collapsing?
[03:35:29.809 --> 03:35:31.590]  Why is San Francisco collapsing?
[03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:33.871]  And why is it overrun with human feces?
[03:35:34.351 --> 03:35:36.953]  Why is Los Angeles overrun with homelessness?
[03:35:37.013 --> 03:35:40.135]  And Seattle overrun with drug addiction and homelessness?
[03:35:40.175 --> 03:35:42.716]  And also filthy conditions on the streets?
[03:35:43.016 --> 03:35:45.858]  It's because liberals, they promote these policies.
[03:35:46.474 --> 03:35:55.837]  Liberals destroy the environment because they allow feces to just run rampant across their cities, across their oceans, and across their beaches.
[03:35:56.217 --> 03:35:59.838]  And this is exactly what's happening, and it has arrived in Texas.
[03:36:00.359 --> 03:36:04.140]  So I'm curious to see what other evidence comes out about this.
[03:36:05.089 --> 03:36:17.354]  Because I know for a fact that many other people are very much aware of this problem, but there has been a very concerted effort to try to keep the lid on this problem with the IAH International Airport.
[03:36:19.295 --> 03:36:21.916]  Again, what's happening is they're taking a shortcut.
[03:36:22.640 --> 03:36:29.285]  It's easier to just dump all that sewage into the storm drains rather than put it into the correct location, which is the city sewage treatment system.
[03:36:29.686 --> 03:36:33.128]  So for whatever reason, the workers, there's a big truck there.
[03:36:33.429 --> 03:36:45.458]  They siphon off all of the feces in this truck, and this truck has a grinder in it, and it's supposed to grind up all of this sewage into, you know, more of a homogenized, you know, sewage liquid.
[03:36:45.958 --> 03:36:48.400]  And so these trucks are just dumping it into the storm drains.
[03:36:48.480 --> 03:36:49.121]  That's what's happening.
[03:36:49.662 --> 03:36:52.245]  Alright, now moving on to the next story here.
[03:36:52.265 --> 03:36:54.407]  Another exclusive we have.
[03:36:54.627 --> 03:36:59.311]  I have covered this on Natural News, but you will only hear this from the independent media.
[03:37:00.032 --> 03:37:01.434]  Glyphosate in beer.
[03:37:01.914 --> 03:37:06.779]  The media is running a massive hoax about glyphosate concentrations in beer.
[03:37:07.259 --> 03:37:14.106]  The media is trying to scare you to tell you that if you drink beer, you're going to be harmed or even given cancer by glyphosate.
[03:37:15.063 --> 03:37:20.284]  So, they will report that beer has tested positive for glyphosate.
[03:37:20.765 --> 03:37:30.307]  Well, I'm here to tell you, as a practicing food scientist running an accredited laboratory, that the term testing positive for glyphosate is scientifically meaningless.
[03:37:30.327 --> 03:37:31.067]  It doesn't mean anything.
[03:37:31.608 --> 03:37:34.948]  Because if you just have one molecule of glyphosate, then it tests positive for it.
[03:37:35.309 --> 03:37:36.669]  What matters is the concentration.
[03:37:37.432 --> 03:37:46.644]  And we purchased 26 off the shelf beer products, all the popular beers that you can think of, plus some other sort of off the wall beers.
[03:37:47.565 --> 03:37:50.589]  And we tested them for glyphosate using a triple quad mass spec instrument.
[03:37:50.670 --> 03:37:54.735]  It's chromatography combined with mass spectrometry in our lab.
[03:37:55.581 --> 03:37:59.482]  And we have published the results now in the article that's on Natural News.
[03:37:59.543 --> 03:38:04.884]  Those results show that most of the beers have zero or near zero glyphosate.
[03:38:05.325 --> 03:38:08.326]  And the highest level we found is only 10 parts per billion.
[03:38:08.726 --> 03:38:08.986]  Actually 10.08.
[03:38:09.046 --> 03:38:15.268]  That is a nanogram per milliliter, if you're curious about the correct units.
[03:38:15.688 --> 03:38:18.089]  A nanogram is a billionth of a gram.
[03:38:18.810 --> 03:38:22.531]  And a milliliter, you know, is about 20 drops, roughly 20 drops of a liquid.
[03:38:23.419 --> 03:38:27.241]  So we're talking about 10 billionths of a gram in a few drops.
[03:38:27.822 --> 03:38:31.004]  That is so low that most food scientists would consider to be zero.
[03:38:31.584 --> 03:38:37.308]  And yet the mainstream media is trying to scare you into thinking that it's unsafe to drink beer because of glyphosate contamination.
[03:38:38.128 --> 03:38:45.653]  I've been outspoken about glyphosate as a toxic cancer-causing weed killer, and it is if you drink it or you get a lot of it on your skin.
[03:38:46.273 --> 03:38:50.596]  But we did the math on beer and glyphosate, and it turns out
[03:38:51.417 --> 03:39:14.126]  You'd have to drink 41,000 liters of beer to get the same amount of glyphosate exposure that you would experience from spilling just one milliliter on your skin of a glyphosate concentrate weed killer product that you might purchase at a farm supply store or, you know, like Home Depot or wherever you go buy lawn care or groundskeeping types of weed killer.
[03:39:14.907 --> 03:39:29.591]  So your number one exposure to glyphosate is going to be if you're using it to spray weeds around your house or lawn, or if schools are using it as they do around playgrounds for children, or cities are using it in city parks.
[03:39:30.231 --> 03:39:35.312]  But drinking beer will expose you to virtually zero glyphosate
[03:39:36.087 --> 03:39:39.769]  And again, we tested 26 beers, which is statistically significant.
[03:39:39.809 --> 03:39:44.012]  We did not find any level of glyphosate that would even be considered non-zero.
[03:39:44.833 --> 03:39:46.834]  That's what's amazing about this.
[03:39:46.994 --> 03:39:49.396]  All the glyphosate that we found is basically zero.
[03:39:50.096 --> 03:39:54.319]  So the media, once again, is lying to you about this issue.
[03:39:54.699 --> 03:39:56.040]  They're trying to alert you
[03:39:56.903 --> 03:40:00.925]  Even as those journalists are scientifically illiterate, they don't know what they're talking about.
[03:40:01.346 --> 03:40:02.086]  They have no idea.
[03:40:02.446 --> 03:40:15.634]  Oh yeah, they're showing right now, for those of you watching, they're showing my video in the lab where I walk you through this with our triple quad mass spec instrument, testing all the beers, looking at the results, and concluding that there's no problem from beer.
[03:40:19.207 --> 03:40:36.306]  We are going to be investigating orange juice and we're going to be investigating wine and some other products as well, but I suspect strongly right now that we're going to find roughly the same conclusion here, which is that there are not levels of glyphosate in these products that would pose any long-term health risk to you.
[03:40:36.627 --> 03:40:37.368]  So instead of being
[03:40:38.028 --> 03:40:41.010]  Afraid of glyphosate in beer?
[03:40:41.491 --> 03:40:42.191]  Just have a beer.
[03:40:42.231 --> 03:40:44.172]  Just enjoy a beer on a Friday.
[03:40:44.533 --> 03:40:45.713]  Wave the American flag.
[03:40:46.114 --> 03:40:46.794]  Drink a beer.
[03:40:47.034 --> 03:40:48.415]  You know, salute our veterans.
[03:40:48.996 --> 03:40:53.879]  And don't freak out because the media is trying to scare you to death about everything, which is the way the media operates.
[03:40:54.559 --> 03:40:58.382]  But also, don't use glyphosate as a weed killer around your house.
[03:40:58.442 --> 03:40:59.783]  That's where you're going to get all the exposure.
[03:41:00.501 --> 03:41:12.057]  And in fact, if you look at the court cases where Monsanto has been found to be complicit in causing cancer in people, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, that's because of topical exposure on their skin.
[03:41:12.578 --> 03:41:14.160]  That's where you get the big exposure.
[03:41:14.753 --> 03:41:18.236]  And so I just say all this because I want you to be informed about this.
[03:41:18.296 --> 03:41:20.778]  Of course I support organic products.
[03:41:20.838 --> 03:41:24.881]  Of course I support avoiding pesticides and avoiding glyphosate.
[03:41:25.221 --> 03:41:28.023]  But I also support honesty and integrity in science.
[03:41:28.403 --> 03:41:34.588]  And I don't want you to be artificially made to fear something when there's no risk involved in it.
[03:41:34.648 --> 03:41:36.089]  And that's what the media is doing.
[03:41:36.609 --> 03:41:40.592]  Same way the media tries to scare all these leftists about Russians everywhere.
[03:41:40.993 --> 03:41:43.875]  Or they try to say there are concentration camps on the border.
[03:41:44.375 --> 03:41:54.599]  That's the same media that says, oh, take your vaccine shots because mercury is safe, they say, but then a few picograms or nanograms of glyphosate, they say, might kill you.
[03:41:54.619 --> 03:41:55.519]  That's it's absurd.
[03:41:56.699 --> 03:41:59.801]  You're not going to die from the glyphosate in beer.
[03:42:00.201 --> 03:42:02.682]  Now, sure, you might die from trying to drink 41,000 liters of beer.
[03:42:04.661 --> 03:42:13.432]  If you're trying to match that number and you're doing that on a Friday night, you know, you might kill yourself with cirrhosis of the liver or drunk driving or what have you.
[03:42:13.472 --> 03:42:18.097]  So, of course, drink responsibly if you do drink, but you're not going to die from the glyphosate in beer.
[03:42:19.118 --> 03:42:21.581]  I mean, aren't you glad that we're doing this lab science?
[03:42:21.801 --> 03:42:22.843]  The FDA is not doing this.
[03:42:23.203 --> 03:42:24.344]  The EPA isn't doing this.
[03:42:24.664 --> 03:42:27.745]  The federal government, with all its funding, is not doing this science.
[03:42:28.106 --> 03:42:30.947]  We're doing it without using a dime of taxpayer money.
[03:42:31.407 --> 03:42:35.289]  Sharing the results here with you for free, publicly, right here on InfoWars.com.
[03:42:35.750 --> 03:42:37.471]  Factual News, this is what we do.
[03:42:37.851 --> 03:42:39.372]  Science in the public interest.
[03:42:40.092 --> 03:42:43.594]  So, I've got more stories ahead on the other side of this.
[03:42:44.628 --> 03:42:45.108]  Stay with us.
[03:42:45.148 --> 03:42:52.132]  We'll be right back after this coming break with more analysis of California's election fraud and much more straight ahead.
[03:42:52.172 --> 03:42:55.573]  You're watching the InfoWars Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:55.593 --> 03:42:56.414]  We'll be right back.
[03:43:06.783 --> 03:43:08.205]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[03:43:08.225 --> 03:43:09.006]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[03:43:09.026 --> 03:43:09.467]  You're on the air.
[03:43:09.587 --> 03:43:10.128]  Hey, Alex.
[03:43:10.208 --> 03:43:14.234]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer.
[03:43:14.334 --> 03:43:16.798]  And to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago.
[03:43:16.838 --> 03:43:18.500]  And I'm very thankful that I found you.
[03:43:18.560 --> 03:43:22.106]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[03:43:22.346 --> 03:43:23.447]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:43:23.507 --> 03:43:23.907]  Exactly.
[03:43:23.927 --> 03:43:24.928]  We're all kindred spirits.
[03:43:25.108 --> 03:43:25.628]  We really are.
[03:43:25.648 --> 03:43:26.128]  We really are.
[03:43:26.148 --> 03:43:27.789]  And listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:30.471]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[03:43:30.631 --> 03:43:32.913]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[03:43:33.153 --> 03:43:34.033]  What would you recommend?
[03:43:34.194 --> 03:43:36.835]  I mean, literally, it's joints, it's muscle, it's everything.
[03:43:36.915 --> 03:43:38.696]  What would you recommend to me to purchase?
[03:43:38.716 --> 03:43:42.159]  You know, I think X2 or X3, because that's a building block to everything.
[03:43:42.179 --> 03:43:43.940]  And if you don't have that, the bad halogens take over.
[03:43:43.980 --> 03:43:46.201]  And I would think Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[03:43:46.261 --> 03:43:47.522]  Turmeric is amazing.
[03:43:47.562 --> 03:43:49.063]  This is a very strong extract.
[03:43:49.163 --> 03:43:50.224]  One of the strongest out there.
[03:43:50.244 --> 03:43:51.885]  Probably the strongest, but there may be one stronger.
[03:43:53.746 --> 03:43:56.188]  I would think Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:43:56.328 --> 03:44:00.330]  They've all bombarded us with synthetic hormones that mess up our body.
[03:44:00.411 --> 03:44:13.219]  But then, if you get Preglanone, in my experience, I'm no doctor, I just talk to the scientists, with these other herbs like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus, I think you should go through the products, every body is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[03:44:13.259 --> 03:44:21.284]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest, just like whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[03:44:21.364 --> 03:44:21.965]  That's it.
[03:44:22.005 --> 03:44:23.446]  Because I would, I'm gonna explain this again.
[03:44:23.886 --> 03:44:25.207]  I'm a very superstitious person.
[03:44:25.988 --> 03:44:26.968]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[03:44:27.609 --> 03:44:28.910]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[03:44:28.950 --> 03:44:30.991]  You've got my total commitment, anything I do.
[03:44:31.351 --> 03:44:32.992]  Information, any of it.
[03:44:33.313 --> 03:44:37.255]  Products, like they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[03:44:37.395 --> 03:44:38.756]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[03:44:38.776 --> 03:44:42.979]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have like the two best.
[03:44:43.259 --> 03:44:44.240]  Why'd I do that?
[03:44:44.400 --> 03:44:45.921]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[03:44:46.021 --> 03:44:56.986]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality, because there's always like some space-age $5,000 thing that's better, but I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit, and that's what I promote.
[03:44:57.086 --> 03:44:58.847]  So, so, that's my advice on that.
[03:44:58.967 --> 03:44:59.467]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:44:59.867 --> 03:45:06.196]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[03:45:06.236 --> 03:45:08.158]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[03:45:08.278 --> 03:45:09.720]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[03:45:09.760 --> 03:45:16.970]  Well, now listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal, is you need to talk to a physician, you need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:18.711]  Most people have almost none of it.
[03:45:18.751 --> 03:45:21.774]  But if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you could have some issues.
[03:45:21.914 --> 03:45:23.075]  Detoxing, you name it.
[03:45:23.135 --> 03:45:25.797]  I mean, this stuff, this is it, man.
[03:45:25.937 --> 03:45:27.338]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[03:45:27.478 --> 03:45:28.119]  It's dangerous.
[03:45:28.339 --> 03:45:31.001]  Because it's an element you've got to have, they've taken away from you.
[03:45:31.101 --> 03:45:32.942]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[03:45:33.002 --> 03:45:33.643]  You've got to be careful.
[03:45:33.763 --> 03:45:37.564]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[03:45:37.644 --> 03:45:39.164]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[03:45:40.365 --> 03:45:44.246]  Your organs, everything operates, your hormones are produced with halogen.
[03:45:44.346 --> 03:45:47.947]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[03:45:48.007 --> 03:45:48.967]  So this is the good thing.
[03:45:49.007 --> 03:45:51.968]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched, kicked in the head by a mule.
[03:45:51.988 --> 03:45:53.248]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[03:45:53.288 --> 03:45:54.148]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[03:45:54.288 --> 03:45:56.209]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:57.969]  We just research what the globalists are doing.
[03:45:58.129 --> 03:45:58.910]  We do the opposite.
[03:45:58.950 --> 03:46:00.070]  But yes, everyone
[03:46:00.250 --> 03:46:04.674]  With X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[03:46:04.714 --> 03:46:05.694]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[03:46:05.814 --> 03:46:09.537]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, OK?
[03:46:09.577 --> 03:46:10.658]  So I'm going to explain it again.
[03:46:10.738 --> 03:46:12.840]  Without iodine, you die.
[03:46:12.860 --> 03:46:14.381]  The fields are depleted.
[03:46:14.541 --> 03:46:15.322]  Everything's depleted.
[03:46:15.522 --> 03:46:21.007]  Most iodine is bound to iron, copper, or lead, or something else.
[03:46:21.067 --> 03:46:21.907]  You don't get it.
[03:46:22.007 --> 03:46:24.629]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[03:46:24.890 --> 03:46:25.910]  So yeah, be careful.
[03:46:26.071 --> 03:46:27.352]  Iodine, you have to have.
[03:46:28.092 --> 03:46:29.833]  It's just paramount.
[03:46:30.434 --> 03:46:32.295]  And so that's why we sell it.
[03:46:32.355 --> 03:46:33.416]  That's why we've hyped it up.
[03:46:33.476 --> 03:46:35.878]  Because it's what they don't want you to have.
[03:46:35.898 --> 03:46:40.762]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had iodine for your whole life, it's like you've never been in a boxing ring.
[03:46:40.982 --> 03:46:45.205]  And you get in the ring with Mike Tyson, your body's gonna be like, what the hell is that?
[03:46:45.445 --> 03:46:46.726]  Because you've never had it.
[03:46:46.947 --> 03:46:47.847]  It's just iodine.
[03:46:47.907 --> 03:46:49.649]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[03:46:49.889 --> 03:46:52.711]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:52.751 --> 03:46:55.073]  Thank you for shopping and getting great products.
[03:46:55.173 --> 03:46:57.134]  And it helps fund this operation a total $360.
[03:46:57.875 --> 03:46:59.316]  You win and you know I love those.
[03:47:05.619 --> 03:47:08.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:27.282]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:27.763 --> 03:47:31.030]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:47:33.715 --> 03:47:43.424]  In the greatest hypocrisy moment of the debates last night, Democrat candidate Marianne Williamson called for a, quote, moral uprising to defeat Trump.
[03:47:44.044 --> 03:47:59.478]  Apparently, she is not at all aware that her party, the Democrat Party, is the party of Satanism, infanticide, the murder of human children, that her party is the party of immorality, election fraud, censorship,
[03:47:59.978 --> 03:48:23.497]  Taking away the human right of freedom of speech, that her party is the party of transgenderism, indoctrination of children, drag queen story hour brainwashing of children, the chemical castration of children to change their gender, and every other sicko, twisted, wicked, demonic, satanic violation of morality that you can imagine.
[03:48:24.429 --> 03:48:25.410]  Apparently she has no clue.
[03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:34.455]  She should be calling for a moral uprising to defeat the radical left and their satanism and their incredible immorality.
[03:48:34.495 --> 03:48:42.439]  In fact, I would agree with the premise that we do need a moral uprising in America, but it would defeat the radical left.
[03:48:43.160 --> 03:48:44.200]  It wouldn't defeat Trump.
[03:48:44.621 --> 03:48:45.201]  Are you kidding me?
[03:48:45.601 --> 03:48:46.322]  Trump would support
[03:48:47.671 --> 03:48:49.933]  A return of morality to America.
[03:48:50.094 --> 03:49:03.508]  We need to have a moral uprising to stop the Netflix indoctrination of children with sicko teenage orgy scenes that are now broadcast by Netflix and even Amazon Prime.
[03:49:04.088 --> 03:49:09.451]  While they ban documentaries that expose the truth about vaccines or the truth about GMOs.
[03:49:09.791 --> 03:49:13.212]  So think about the real morality issues in this country.
[03:49:13.673 --> 03:49:18.935]  A country that, at least for the radical left part, has embraced Satanism and Communism.
[03:49:19.355 --> 03:49:21.316]  And they want to lecture us about morality?
[03:49:21.737 --> 03:49:22.357]  Give me a break.
[03:49:22.977 --> 03:49:24.498]  Speaking of California,
[03:49:25.259 --> 03:49:29.443]  Now, there are many wonderful Californians listening to this show right now.
[03:49:29.904 --> 03:49:31.105]  Many of you are patriots.
[03:49:31.165 --> 03:49:35.349]  Many of you are very sickened by what's happening to your state, and we get that.
[03:49:36.150 --> 03:49:42.957]  And yet, I think you would agree that we've reached a point where California now trying to remove President Trump
[03:49:43.519 --> 03:49:44.340]  From ballot.
[03:49:44.881 --> 03:49:57.595]  In fact, according to reports, Governor Newsom is that bill into law, and I believe it would remove President Trump from the at least the primaries, maybe an attempt to remove him from the general election in 2020.
[03:49:59.111 --> 03:50:14.697]  If that's true, this is such a violation of law, it's total fraud on the part of the California legislature and the governor, that I think it's time that we, the American people, call for California's Electoral College votes to be removed from the nationwide tally.
[03:50:15.257 --> 03:50:20.039]  If they won't let people vote for President Trump, then, well, their Electoral College shouldn't count.
[03:50:20.743 --> 03:50:37.333]  In fact, there's so many illegals voting in California, with the, really the permission of the governor and the advocacy of state lawmakers, that we really have to probably nullify California's senators and members of Congress.
[03:50:37.734 --> 03:50:44.338]  Because they were illegally voted into office by illegal aliens, who should never have the right to vote in U.S.
[03:50:44.438 --> 03:50:46.279]  elections, but have the right
[03:50:47.068 --> 03:50:55.940]  Fraudulently by the con artist politicians who run the state of California even as the good people of California stand opposed to that corruption.
[03:50:56.440 --> 03:51:01.287]  So we need to really rethink if they're going to play this kind of game and say well Trump can't be on the ballot.
[03:51:01.767 --> 03:51:04.251]  They're trying to de-platform Trump from the election.
[03:51:04.711 --> 03:51:10.754]  And you see the game they're playing is then they'll say, well, gosh, Trump didn't win the national popular vote.
[03:51:11.195 --> 03:51:13.016]  He didn't get any votes in California.
[03:51:13.056 --> 03:51:13.796]  That's amazing.
[03:51:13.876 --> 03:51:22.141]  So the other candidate won the popular vote, and then they'll try to invoke the national popular vote compact to say, well, Trump should lose the election.
[03:51:22.401 --> 03:51:24.182]  He didn't win the national popular vote.
[03:51:24.202 --> 03:51:29.145]  And they'll try to have the other states rig their electoral votes to give Trump a defeat.
[03:51:29.825 --> 03:51:33.347]  And put whoever the Democrat candidate is into office.
[03:51:33.367 --> 03:51:38.170]  Whoever that may be, probably Elizabeth Warren or Kamala Harris is my guess.
[03:51:38.511 --> 03:51:47.596]  With a wild card, maybe Michelle Obama jumps into the race at the very last minute because it will be realized that no one else can beat Trump.
[03:51:48.136 --> 03:51:50.458]  In any case, that's a wild card scenario.
[03:51:50.478 --> 03:51:51.138]  We'll see what happens.
[03:51:52.219 --> 03:51:56.201]  But the truth is that liberals and radical Democrats will not play by the rules.
[03:51:56.241 --> 03:51:58.583]  They will always commit fraud.
[03:51:59.835 --> 03:52:02.656]  Now, one final thought for this show today.
[03:52:03.176 --> 03:52:05.956]  Liberalism functions like a cancer tumor.
[03:52:07.137 --> 03:52:08.197]  I want to explain something.
[03:52:09.737 --> 03:52:15.498]  You may not be familiar with the term angiogenesis, the term used in physiology and oncology.
[03:52:15.518 --> 03:52:27.741]  It means when a cancer tumor builds new blood supply to itself to siphon off resources from the rest of the host so that it, the tumor, can grow bigger and bigger and bigger and cause more damage and destroy more things.
[03:52:28.496 --> 03:52:30.378]  This is exactly how liberalism works.
[03:52:31.018 --> 03:52:52.938]  Liberalism wants to raise taxes and siphon off resources from the rest of the country while growing its tumor-like authoritarian tyranny and censorship and horrifically bad economic policies that lead to, for example, feces rolling in the streets of San Francisco and feces all over the beaches of Texas and California as well.
[03:52:53.979 --> 03:52:54.900]  Liberalism is a tumor.
[03:52:55.692 --> 03:52:58.394]  But it functions through a process of angiogenesis.
[03:52:58.695 --> 03:53:02.458]  That is, stealing more resources to grow itself and make itself bigger.
[03:53:03.198 --> 03:53:06.481]  We, the people, are the immune system of America.
[03:53:06.961 --> 03:53:07.882]  We are the immune system.
[03:53:08.683 --> 03:53:12.926]  We are the cells that are supposed to run around and stop the tumors from getting bigger.
[03:53:13.587 --> 03:53:19.371]  We're supposed to cut off the supply of resources to the tumors, so that the tumors don't kill the host.
[03:53:19.411 --> 03:53:23.455]  In other words, so that liberalism doesn't destroy America, which is exactly what it's trying to do.
[03:53:24.201 --> 03:53:26.585]  You could even say communism is like a cancer tumor.
[03:53:27.266 --> 03:53:33.836]  Communism will destroy our country if we allow it to continue to expand its influence.
[03:53:35.242 --> 03:53:40.886]  Think about you, and think about also the Second Amendment rights of the American people.
[03:53:41.066 --> 03:53:51.012]  Why did the Founding Fathers grant the American people the power and the right to defend your nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic?
[03:53:51.452 --> 03:53:56.175]  Why was the Second Amendment written as the Second Amendment, not the Ninth or Tenth?
[03:53:56.475 --> 03:53:57.536]  It's the Second Amendment.
[03:53:58.036 --> 03:54:02.019]  It's the second most important, right after freedom of speech, freedom of religious expression, and so on.
[03:54:02.651 --> 03:54:08.217]  Because the Second Amendment is the people's immune system against tyranny.
[03:54:09.138 --> 03:54:25.355]  And note that the same people in California, Gavin Newsom and others, who are absolutely trying to rig the election to steal this democracy, to overthrow the presidency, and to destroy this country, those are the very same people who are trying to take away your Second Amendment rights.
[03:54:26.272 --> 03:54:33.614]  All over the country now, even in Florida, we're seeing these bureaucrats try to say that an AR-15 is not needed for self-defense.
[03:54:34.354 --> 03:54:38.015]  They're saying that AR-15s are weapons of war, which is nonsense!
[03:54:38.315 --> 03:54:40.976]  And by the way, an AR-15 is a great self-defense weapon.
[03:54:41.516 --> 03:54:45.037]  I would certainly like a 30-round magazine if someone breaks into my home.
[03:54:45.517 --> 03:54:49.118]  In fact, I wouldn't mind a 60-round magazine in that AR.
[03:54:49.638 --> 03:54:51.759]  And an AR-15 gives you some range.
[03:54:52.079 --> 03:54:54.840]  You can put rounds downrange with accuracy,
[03:54:56.140 --> 03:55:01.484]  300, 400 yards even with an AR, and you can't do that with a shotgun, and you can't do that with a pistol.
[03:55:01.964 --> 03:55:08.449]  So an AR-15 is a great self-defense weapon, which is exactly why the Cancer Tumor Democrats are trying to take it away from everybody.
[03:55:09.133 --> 03:55:12.878]  And why do you think, what do you think they have in mind after they take your weapons away?
[03:55:13.358 --> 03:55:15.181]  After they take away your First Amendment rights?
[03:55:15.782 --> 03:55:23.031]  After they criminalize Christianity and bibles and de-platform you and rig the election and take away your guns?
[03:55:23.531 --> 03:55:24.713]  What do you think happens next?
[03:55:25.294 --> 03:55:26.956]  Of course, well...
[03:55:27.783 --> 03:55:35.128]  I gotta say it, it's just like the Maoist Revolution, the Cultural Revolution, mass executions of the political enemies of the left.
[03:55:35.589 --> 03:55:38.871]  They will run door-to-door, town-to-town, county-to-county.
[03:55:39.391 --> 03:55:41.312]  They will try to execute Christians.
[03:55:41.473 --> 03:55:42.934]  They will try to execute Trump supporters.
[03:55:43.514 --> 03:55:46.356]  They will try to execute anybody who is unwilling to turn in their guns.
[03:55:46.972 --> 03:55:57.086]  If they can take your guns first and disarm you, then that makes their invasion, makes their fraud, makes their cancer tumor-like activity so much easier to carry out.
[03:55:57.586 --> 03:56:01.532]  And that is why I urge all of you, all across the country,
[03:56:02.322 --> 03:56:06.764]  Even if your state passes a law that says you can't own an AR-15, guess what?
[03:56:07.185 --> 03:56:13.588]  A higher law, the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, says that you can own that AR-15.
[03:56:14.128 --> 03:56:20.752]  And that's based on divine law, the law of God, which says that you have a divine right to defend yourself against tyranny.
[03:56:21.352 --> 03:56:39.782]  A divine right to defend your nation against its enemies, and a divine right to defend your families and your communities against the onslaught of communism, socialism, authoritarian tyranny that's being pushed by the radical left, which functions as a giant, deadly cancer tumor trying to overtake this body.
[03:56:40.283 --> 03:56:41.643]  You are America's immune system.
[03:56:42.144 --> 03:56:47.727]  Be prepared to activate your immunology, so to speak, so that you can defend this country.
[03:56:48.706 --> 03:56:50.207]  And lastly, we got about one minute left.
[03:56:50.687 --> 03:56:56.070]  I just want to thank you for all of your support for InfoWars and my work as well.

[03:57:40.232 --> 03:57:41.773]  This is Mike Adams from Natural News.
[03:57:42.233 --> 03:57:42.473]  Be safe.
[03:57:52.432 --> 03:57:53.134]  This is important.
[03:57:54.456 --> 03:57:55.639]  I'm 45 years old.
[03:57:56.761 --> 03:58:02.795]  When I was 35, I swam to two miles a day sometimes, and would jog, and couldn't lose weight.
[03:58:03.683 --> 03:58:06.225]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[03:58:06.425 --> 03:58:11.029]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[03:58:11.669 --> 03:58:16.853]  I knew all about the Private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, the pedophile rings.
[03:58:17.173 --> 03:58:22.097]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the Psycoms in.
[03:58:22.297 --> 03:58:24.038]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[03:58:24.739 --> 03:58:26.060]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[03:58:27.201 --> 03:58:28.582]  I didn't know about all this.
[03:58:29.362 --> 03:58:31.024]  And I didn't know about clean iodine.
[03:58:32.125 --> 03:58:33.686]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[03:58:34.806 --> 03:58:43.049]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[03:58:43.849 --> 03:58:49.911]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[03:58:49.931 --> 03:58:51.452]  Let me tell you something right now.
[03:58:52.772 --> 03:58:53.653]  You see DNA Force?
[03:58:54.693 --> 03:58:59.715]  I went out to top manufacturers, the most respected, most highly tested, and I said I want
