[00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:13.230]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.636]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:21.300]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:41.754]  I talk about this all the time, but the quickening is here.
[00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:46.197]  And humanity is at a crossroads deciding which way it's going to go.
[00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:51.461]  There's so many amazing developments taking place that it makes my head spin.
[00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:59.527]  But as I sit here in California, before the sun's even come up, it's a metaphor for a new day.
[00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:02.169]  I talked so much yesterday.
[00:01:03.263 --> 00:01:07.005]  That my tongue is literally raw on one side and sore.
[00:01:07.926 --> 00:01:14.729]  I did a five hour podcast with a gentleman who right now is the number one podcaster in the world.
[00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.013]  Joe Rogan is number one overall, the body of his great work, but this fella right now is the number one podcast.
[00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.214]  He's only been doing it about two weeks.
[00:01:23.254 --> 00:01:27.076]  And I'm not even going to say who he did the podcast with until right before it airs.
[00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:32.805]  It was very explosive, very positive, very negative, very argumentative.
[00:01:33.746 --> 00:01:38.149]  The fellow's very, very smart, but he was trying to get me to turn against Trump.
[00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:43.334]  I've been persecuted so much for Trump, and for telling the truth.
[00:01:43.494 --> 00:01:47.117]  That's why it's hard to even be critical of Trump when he deserves it.
[00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:54.404]  Because when you've been pig-headed, defending somebody for so long, and been persecuted,
[00:01:55.612 --> 00:01:59.395]  It's hard to turn on him, but I'm not close to turning on Trump.
[00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:15.926]  Trump has done a great job on so many fronts, but what happens is when you get around people in Hollywood or in business or anywhere, they get on your ass and they say, listen, I really like you, but you need to turn against Trump right now or I'm not going to be your friend.
[00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:18.628]  Well, don't be my friend then.
[00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:24.782]  Because the BS that Trump is a white supremacist, no matter how many times you say it isn't true.
[00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:29.444]  The BS that Brett Kavanaugh is a rapist, no matter how many times you say it, it's not true.
[00:02:30.204 --> 00:02:36.346]  The BS that I'm making stuff up to hurt people isn't true, no matter how many times you say it.
[00:02:37.686 --> 00:02:41.387]  And all this bullying and intimidation isn't working anymore.
[00:02:41.407 --> 00:02:44.008]  But I see why some people succumb to it.
[00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.550]  But then after you start talking to them behind the scenes, they go, yeah, I know you're right.
[00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.131]  And that's happening all over LA.
[00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:55.532]  We're super popular here.
[00:02:56.632 --> 00:03:02.034]  Even though you're in the midst of all the brainwashing and inside this big-ass bubble of disinformation.
[00:03:02.894 --> 00:03:04.775]  So we got Tom Papert hosting the show today.
[00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:06.396]  He does a great job.
[00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:14.779]  Yesterday's broadcast with Owen Schroyer and the reports we had, I ended up watching about an hour of it last night.
[00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.000]  I watched about an hour of it this morning.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.901]  Just top-flight radio TV.
[00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:21.461]  There's nothing more informative.
[00:03:22.122 --> 00:03:33.182]  Yesterday's Tuesday show is the benchmark of quality information that's pro-human for a pro-human future.
[00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:37.183]  The globalists have decided that they're going to replace humans.
[00:03:37.964 --> 00:03:38.945]  It's the final revolution.
[00:03:39.005 --> 00:03:40.025]  Nobody can ever resist you.
[00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:42.387]  You just end the entire paradigm as it's known.
[00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:48.092]  We are standing against that saying we're not just going to accept your destiny you laid out for us.
[00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:54.376]  And that's what InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Banned.Video are all about.
[00:03:54.997 --> 00:03:59.881]  And that's why the power, again, that you have to take action and override their censorship is beyond paramount.
[00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:00.801]  It's total.
[00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:01.422]  It's complete.
[00:04:01.802 --> 00:04:02.523]  It is victory.
[00:04:03.303 --> 00:04:05.185]  Resistance and action is victory.
[00:04:05.765 --> 00:04:07.687]  When you have the right motivation and the right ideology.
[00:04:08.747 --> 00:04:10.249]  And this is a pro-human ideology.
[00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:12.550]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:14.972]  Now we've got a bunch of special reports today.
[00:04:15.032 --> 00:04:17.354]  Tom Pafford and so much more.
[00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:21.257]  I'll be back in the office about 1 o'clock so I can pop it on air.
[00:04:21.297 --> 00:04:22.038]  Unless my tongue...
[00:04:23.502 --> 00:04:29.988]  Over here on the side, I'm just yelling and ranting for almost five hours, and in most of the show yesterday, so I've never had to swear.
[00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:35.433]  I've got a raw side of my tongue, but my tongue doesn't swell up too much more.
[00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:37.856]  I'll be on there as well at the end, end of the fourth hour.
[00:04:38.596 --> 00:04:39.918]  Regardless, thanks for all your support.
[00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:41.920]  Wild horses couldn't drag us away.
[00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.520]  We love you.
[00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:44.042]  I know you love me.
[00:04:44.102 --> 00:04:44.982]  We're all in this together.
[00:04:45.203 --> 00:04:46.144]  You can feel victory.
[00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.393]  It's going to be a rough future coming up, but we are on a trajectory, on a trajectory to win.
[00:04:53.073 --> 00:04:54.534]  So I'll see you in the future.
[00:04:54.554 --> 00:04:57.315]  That was Alex Jones.
[00:04:57.455 --> 00:04:59.877]  I'm Tom Pafford filling in for Alex today.
[00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:02.378]  We'll be back right after this break.
[00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.221]  I've got a message for the scumbag anti-American Beto O'Rourke.
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.664]  You're down here thinking you can tame Texas and conquer us and destroy us like California.
[00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:16.328]  You think you can turn us into your disarmed slaves?
[00:05:17.148 --> 00:05:21.452]  Beto O'Rourke, you're well known for fantasizing and writing essays about murdering children.
[00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:24.655]  And you even got away with a hit and run, burglary.
[00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:26.817]  You're a dirty criminal.
[00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:31.001]  You've got your own bodyguards because you're hooked into that billionaire wife of yours.
[00:05:31.461 --> 00:05:33.924]  How dare you try to demonize American gun owners?
[00:05:34.324 --> 00:05:38.946]  Just in case you didn't know, this country was founded when the Redcoats came to take the guns in 1775.
[00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:41.147]  That's why we got July 4th.
[00:05:41.187 --> 00:05:46.449]  So I'm going to tell you what George Washington and the Continental Congress told King George III.
[00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.691]  You're not getting our firearms because we're free men, you little piece of crap!
[00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:57.334]  America and the world's glad, though, that you finally got the guts to admit your plan with the rest of those scumbag Democrats.
[00:05:57.855 --> 00:05:59.815]  Beto O'Rourke, you're on notice!
[00:06:00.236 --> 00:06:02.777]  You're not getting our firearms, ever, scumbag!
[00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:13.468]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:13.588 --> 00:06:15.832]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:22.094 --> 00:06:24.976]  Welcome everyone to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:25.096 --> 00:06:30.560]  I am Tom Pappert filling in for Alex as he gets back from this very important trip to California.
[00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:35.564]  He'll be back in studio hopefully later this afternoon around 1 p.m.
[00:06:36.184 --> 00:06:44.250]  Today is an absolutely insane news day as Democratic mega-donor Ed Buck has been arrested.
[00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.752]  A third man died at his home.
[00:06:47.832 --> 00:06:50.374]  Police say that he is directly responsible.
[00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:59.922]  Ed Buck, what he reportedly allegedly likes to do is shove crystal meth into his victims and feed off their energy.
[00:07:00.102 --> 00:07:03.605]  One of the alleged victims actually went public in the media saying that.
[00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:07.228]  It's another episode of Alex Jones was right again.
[00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:10.208]  There's big things happening in the Middle East today as well.
[00:07:10.228 --> 00:07:14.809]  We're going to have a guest on in the second hour, Patrick Howley of National File and the Epoch Times.
[00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.410]  Israel is not a good place to be right now.
[00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.071]  Everybody knows there are issues with Benjamin Netanyahu, the current Prime Minister.
[00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.391]  Everybody knows there are certain issues with Israel.
[00:07:26.471 --> 00:07:32.332]  Nobody understands the foreign aid this country gives to any of these Middle Eastern countries, any country in the world.
[00:07:32.752 --> 00:07:34.593]  I'm personally an isolationist.
[00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:35.613]  I'll come out and say it.
[00:07:35.993 --> 00:07:36.973]  America first.
[00:07:37.193 --> 00:07:45.598]  But what's happening in Israel right now could very well launch the United States into yet another geopolitical conflict in the Middle East.
[00:07:45.818 --> 00:07:46.959]  Nobody is looking forward to that.
[00:07:47.259 --> 00:07:51.802]  The fake news is talking about Elizabeth Warren saying she's the new frontrunner.
[00:07:52.082 --> 00:07:54.964]  They're saying 20,000 people will go to her rallies now.
[00:07:55.044 --> 00:07:56.685]  For some reason, I just don't believe it.
[00:07:57.145 --> 00:08:01.628]  There's a new pandemic threat that could devastate the world population.
[00:08:01.648 --> 00:08:03.109]  There's abortion news.
[00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:07.232]  We're actually at the lowest number of abortions in this country in many, many years.
[00:08:07.912 --> 00:08:17.999]  And as InfoWars has reported for decades now, your TV is listening to you, your Alexa is listening to you, and now your smart faucet is listening to you.
[00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:22.441]  Let's start by talking about Ed Bach.
[00:08:23.202 --> 00:08:24.563]  Again, he was just arrested
[00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:29.125]  Police say that he has killed, now, three people.
[00:08:29.646 --> 00:08:31.551]  Let's go ahead and air this video from LA.
[00:08:36.994 --> 00:08:38.294]  Lou and Cher, good evening to you.
[00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:40.295]  This is still a very active investigation.
[00:08:40.355 --> 00:08:56.498]  The crime scene tape is up, the street is blocked off, and detectives are currently inside the home of prominent Democratic donor Ed Buck, who has been at the center of controversy following the suspicious deaths of two gay men inside his apartment in the span of just 18 months.
[00:08:56.618 --> 00:08:59.858]  Let's get you right to some of this video of the arrest just a short time ago.
[00:09:00.318 --> 00:09:02.859]  Here you can see Buck taken away in handcuffs.
[00:09:17.239 --> 00:09:21.422]  Attorney says Buck injected his victim with methamphetamine on September 11th.
[00:09:21.922 --> 00:09:24.444]  Neighbors say they've been suspicious for years.
[00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:26.505]  Other men were not so lucky.
[00:09:26.785 --> 00:09:34.150]  Last January, 55-year-old Timothy Dean was found dead inside Buck's apartment located here on the 1200 block of North Laurel Avenue.
[00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.073]  The coroner saying he died of a methamphetamine and alcohol toxicity.
[00:09:38.653 --> 00:09:42.235]  He was the second man to die inside the home in less than two years.
[00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:46.257]  In July 2017, 26-year-old Jamel Moore was found dead.
[00:09:46.717 --> 00:09:49.359]  Officials say he died of a methamphetamine overdose.
[00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:52.421]  His death was ruled an accident and no charges were filed.
[00:09:53.021 --> 00:09:58.144]  Those close to Moore say he was working as a sex worker at the time he visited Buck's apartment.
[00:09:58.664 --> 00:10:06.168]  Another man who asked to remain anonymous previously told KTLA that Buck would instruct his male escorts to use high levels of drugs
[00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:08.249]  So he could watch their reactions.
[00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:12.551]  Buck, who was openly gay, was home at the time both men died.
[00:10:13.151 --> 00:10:17.514]  Advocates for the victims, as well as neighbors, say his arrest is a long time coming.
[00:10:19.374 --> 00:10:23.617]  This is one of those instances, and I think we can go ahead and end that video now.
[00:10:23.737 --> 00:10:30.740]  This is one of those instances where you just sit there and wonder, how many people have to wind up dead before police get involved?
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.222]  I guess the number is two, almost three, that we know of.
[00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:45.802]  So, according to prosecutors, Ed Buck, a prominent Democrat donor, big Hillary guy, is a violent, dangerous, sexual predator.
[00:10:46.483 --> 00:10:47.563]  He preys on his victims.
[00:10:47.723 --> 00:10:49.224]  This is allegedly what he likes to do.
[00:10:49.284 --> 00:10:51.405]  Some of the victims have come forward to say this.
[00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:53.927]  He gets a young black man.
[00:10:54.267 --> 00:10:55.228]  He prefers them young.
[00:10:55.268 --> 00:11:02.312]  In fact, the one of the men who died reportedly was a former victim who showed up at his house and Ed Buck reportedly killed him.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:10.845]  But what he likes to do is he gets these young black men, he brings them to his apartment, to what the police are now calling a drug den.
[00:11:11.025 --> 00:11:15.849]  He allegedly shoots them up with drugs, methamphetamine, and he watches their reaction.
[00:11:15.929 --> 00:11:22.094]  He feeds off their energy, according to one of the alleged victim.
[00:11:23.086 --> 00:11:28.051]  The man's name, who says this, and this is what InfoWars has been telling you for years.
[00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:41.043]  According to the Daily Mail, Jermaine Gagnon claims Bunk paid to fly him from Minnesota to his apartment in Los Angeles, drugged him by dissolving a substance into his Gatorade, and then injected him with drugs.
[00:11:41.664 --> 00:11:47.888]  28-year-old provided pictures which show Buck crouching over him on a mattress pull-out bed during one of their nights together.
[00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:53.592]  And a toolbox of sex toys which he pulled out during their encounter.
[00:11:53.952 --> 00:11:55.613]  This man donates to Hillary Clinton.
[00:11:55.933 --> 00:11:58.095]  This man donates to top Democrats.
[00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:09.632]  Now we, of course, have seen his arrest, but what I really want to get to is the quote by this poor individual who says that he is one of the victims, and the photos would seem to suggest there might be some truth to it.
[00:12:10.172 --> 00:12:22.835]  Gagnon says he was homeless and couchsurfing in April of 2018 when he met Buck on a gay dating site, Adam for Adam, and was offered $200 to spend the evening with him at his West Hollywood apartment.
[00:12:22.855 --> 00:12:27.776]  He said, I'd done sex for money many other times, but I don't make it a habit.
[00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:30.177]  First day we met, I met him at his house.
[00:12:30.217 --> 00:12:32.938]  There's a gate at the main entrance, and he buzzed me up.
[00:12:33.038 --> 00:12:33.979]  He's on the second floor.
[00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:42.404]  When I walked in, it was dim lights, a mattress in the middle of the floor, three mirrors surrounding the mattress, and a flat-screen TV mounted on a wall.
[00:12:42.424 --> 00:12:43.624]  It was just kind of weird.
[00:12:44.245 --> 00:12:50.448]  He admitted explaining the 63-year-old enjoyed dressing him up and treating him like a sex slave.
[00:12:52.298 --> 00:12:59.604]  He said that Buck was open about enjoying men who are young, black, handsome, and well-endowed.
[00:13:00.425 --> 00:13:04.008]  He was quite open about being very generous to the black community.
[00:13:05.109 --> 00:13:08.672]  He went on, I'm his type, and pretty much half the black community is his type.
[00:13:08.772 --> 00:13:09.333]  Vulnerable.
[00:13:09.653 --> 00:13:10.253]  Depressed.
[00:13:10.634 --> 00:13:15.278]  If you're in a depressive state, that's the energy that feeds him.
[00:13:17.168 --> 00:13:31.154]  I first came across this article when it was fresh, and now that the man's been arrested, it just really makes you wonder what is going on in this country at the high levels, the stuff that we will likely never know, because all of these headlines are ripped from the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:31.454 --> 00:13:38.278]  Alex has been saying this for years, that these Democrat elite, these globalist elite, they feed off the energy of people.
[00:13:38.578 --> 00:13:43.240]  They will kill you for sports and watch your soul leave your body for fun.
[00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:52.916]  Now we have a victim, alleged victim, who says that Ed Buck literally feeds off of his energy while he drugs people to death.
[00:13:52.957 --> 00:14:01.042]  And this latest man, it sounds like it was a brush with death as he fled the apartment fearing he was having a methamphetamine overdose.
[00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:18.320]  So we're going to have Patrick Hallion in the next hour to talk about how this plays into what goes on with the NXIVM sex cult, to what happened with Jeffrey Epstein, all of these interrelated circles that all work together to create the globalist paradigm.
[00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:21.463]  It's going to be a fascinating interview, but
[00:14:22.588 --> 00:14:26.931]  We're going to follow this story closely as well, because this is a long time coming.
[00:14:27.391 --> 00:14:30.293]  Black activists are rightfully celebrating this.
[00:14:30.353 --> 00:14:36.577]  There was a massive rally protest outside of Buck's apartment late last night.
[00:14:37.438 --> 00:14:42.241]  As again, the third man has been found to have had an overdose at Ed Buck's home.
[00:14:43.121 --> 00:14:49.846]  So in the next segment, we're going to get into exactly what's happening in the Middle East right now, because it is an absolutely shocking thing to see
[00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:55.692]  And I don't like these foreign entanglements that the United States has found itself in.
[00:14:56.552 --> 00:15:02.736]  But for better or worse, the last, oh I don't know, 20 presidents have got us into this mess.
[00:15:03.697 --> 00:15:10.602]  And now, we could easily see these foreign entanglements get us into a new world war.
[00:15:11.583 --> 00:15:14.845]  Netanyahu's opponent who, it seems like he may have lost.
[00:15:15.225 --> 00:15:16.986]  This guy could be the next Prime Minister.
[00:15:17.507 --> 00:15:20.029]  National File, my website, can report that he is
[00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:25.834]  Potentially vulnerable to blackmail by Iran.
[00:15:26.494 --> 00:15:30.597]  And they say that the Israeli deep state wanted him in this position.
[00:15:31.578 --> 00:15:35.061]  It doesn't bode well for peace in the Middle East.
[00:15:36.988 --> 00:15:38.790]  We'll talk more about that in the next segment.
[00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:40.431]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:40.852 --> 00:15:41.753]  I'm Tom Papert.
[00:15:41.953 --> 00:15:43.054]  Filling in for Alex.
[00:15:43.354 --> 00:15:45.797]  Keep an eye out for that very important podcast.
[00:15:45.837 --> 00:15:50.541]  It's going to drop in the next couple weeks it sounds like and I am extremely excited to watch it.
[00:15:50.781 --> 00:15:52.123]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:52.463 --> 00:15:53.784]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[00:15:53.824 --> 00:15:56.207]  Patrick Howley coming up in the next hour.
[00:15:56.447 --> 00:15:59.530]  Make sure to stay tuned for that here on InfoWars.
[00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:14.293]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:17.435]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:16:17.775 --> 00:16:19.276]  What does it mean to not be a victim?
[00:16:20.176 --> 00:16:23.898]  It doesn't mean I like the hard times I've had in my life and some of the things that I've gone through.
[00:16:24.478 --> 00:16:28.701]  But those are things that I survived that made me stronger and informed me better.
[00:16:29.528 --> 00:16:32.229]  And so, what I am is somebody that is a builder.
[00:16:32.909 --> 00:16:34.810]  I'm someone that is a believer in humanity.
[00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.631]  I'm someone that has optimism because I've seen the amazing things our species can do.
[00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:42.272]  And I know we can do amazing things together.
[00:16:42.412 --> 00:16:43.612]  I've been on air 25 years.
[00:16:43.632 --> 00:16:44.752]  I started out on AXS TV.
[00:16:44.872 --> 00:16:53.995]  And I pulled myself up from my bootstraps by working with other people like you who had the same vision, the same quest to stand up against the America haters, the God haters, the unborn haters.
[00:16:54.275 --> 00:16:55.035]  Satanic Globalist.
[00:16:55.215 --> 00:17:03.157]  And now we've been through so much together, that it's important to note, though, that we kind of get to the point where we're so confident, and we've gone through so much, we start thinking we're bulletproof.
[00:17:03.197 --> 00:17:07.118]  I mean, we go through trials, tribulations, and we still fight back and overcome.
[00:17:07.218 --> 00:17:10.159]  But I do need to tell you, we are at the greatest level of attack we've ever been.
[00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:16.360]  I mean, it gets where we have huge hack attacks all the time, and threats, and just crazy stuff I can't get into here on air for obvious reasons.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.501]  And I just brush it off like it's no big deal.
[00:17:18.881 --> 00:17:22.582]  And I really understand that the fearlessness is part of why we're so successful.
[00:17:23.502 --> 00:17:28.163]  But I need to have a concern and a little bit of a fear of being too confident and failing.
[00:17:28.943 --> 00:17:31.263]  Because I'm not watching my six and you're not watching your six.
[00:17:31.463 --> 00:17:35.024]  So listen, sit back for a few minutes and think about how far we've come together.
[00:17:35.084 --> 00:17:36.384]  Think what InfoWars has done.
[00:17:36.444 --> 00:17:37.705]  Think about how the world's changing.
[00:17:37.725 --> 00:17:42.005]  Think about how the globalists are fighting for their political lives right now instead of being arrogant and full control.
[00:17:42.105 --> 00:17:43.446]  I mean, we woke these bastards up.
[00:17:43.506 --> 00:17:44.426]  They thought they had us.
[00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:45.986]  But in truth, they already woke us up.
[00:17:46.046 --> 00:17:47.186]  So the contest is now.
[00:17:47.326 --> 00:17:48.066]  That's what I'm getting at.
[00:17:48.106 --> 00:17:51.387]  So when you spread the word about the site, the videos, the articles, when you buy the products,
[00:17:51.547 --> 00:17:53.027]  When you pray for us, it changes the world.
[00:17:53.147 --> 00:17:56.248]  My message is always the same because it's the truth, now more than ever.
[00:17:56.928 --> 00:17:59.068]  The Lunar 2020 stuff is crazy already.
[00:17:59.208 --> 00:18:12.151]  It's going to get crazier, so please commit to go to InfoWarsTore.com as your general store to get basics you need, like great coffee, like great turmeric, great fish oil, great nootropics, super high quality products, water filtration, air filtration, your replacement filters.
[00:18:12.171 --> 00:18:13.391]  Some of you bought filters 10 years ago.
[00:18:13.611 --> 00:18:14.471]  Probably time to get some.
[00:18:14.591 --> 00:18:15.731]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:18:15.811 --> 00:18:16.731]  We're provisioning you.
[00:18:16.851 --> 00:18:17.652]  You're provisioning us.
[00:18:17.872 --> 00:18:19.332]  It is a 360 win, a symbiotic relationship.
[00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:20.392]  I think so.
[00:18:42.338 --> 00:18:43.358]  The war is now!
[00:18:43.679 --> 00:18:49.521]  The globalists are coming for your freedom, your children, your genetics, your treasure, your future, your destiny!
[00:18:49.781 --> 00:18:50.282]  Awaken!
[00:18:50.482 --> 00:18:51.342]  Get charged up!
[00:18:51.642 --> 00:18:52.403]  And resist!
[00:18:52.643 --> 00:18:53.763]  You are the future!
[00:18:53.983 --> 00:18:54.864]  You are the leaders!
[00:18:55.084 --> 00:18:56.825]  And you are unstoppable!
[00:19:00.726 --> 00:19:00.966]  Now!
[00:19:10.263 --> 00:19:10.803]  Ban.Video!
[00:19:11.344 --> 00:19:11.904]  Ban.Video!
[00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:12.564]  Ban.Video!
[00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.185]  Ban.Video!
[00:19:14.506 --> 00:19:15.626]  Ban.Video!
[00:19:15.686 --> 00:19:16.707]  Ban.Video!
[00:19:17.367 --> 00:19:21.289]  Shove that up your... Crawl, you pieces of garbage New World Order!
[00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.871]  I'll tell you about that later, but you want to find out.
[00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:28.373]  It's InfoWars now, but soon it'll be everybody else who wants to resist.
[00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:31.015]  We are building an army to bring
[00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:36.202]  So get out the way!
[00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:37.602]  Move, bitch!
[00:19:37.662 --> 00:19:38.703]  Get out the way!
[00:19:38.723 --> 00:19:40.043]  Move out the way, bitch!
[00:19:40.143 --> 00:19:41.003]  Get out the way!
[00:19:41.804 --> 00:19:42.084]  Sorry.
[00:19:43.044 --> 00:19:44.345]  Quoting Ludacris here.
[00:19:45.385 --> 00:19:46.586]  Move, O'Donnell!
[00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:47.626]  Get out the way!
[00:19:47.946 --> 00:19:48.906]  Move, O'Donnell!
[00:19:48.986 --> 00:19:49.887]  Get out the way!
[00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:50.887]  Get out the way!
[00:19:51.047 --> 00:19:51.948]  You see them headlights?
[00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:53.608]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[00:19:53.628 --> 00:19:55.589]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[00:19:55.649 --> 00:19:56.289]  Tell me that!
[00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.070]  Get out of my way!
[00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.331]  That's Americana, bitch!
[00:20:05.532 --> 00:20:11.495]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:24.701 --> 00:20:29.664]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:35.714 --> 00:20:37.915]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:37.975 --> 00:20:42.538]  I'm Tom Pampert filling in for Alex as again he's on a very important podcast.
[00:20:42.598 --> 00:20:44.299]  I'm very much looking forward to seeing that.
[00:20:44.659 --> 00:20:53.324]  Before we get into what's happening in the Middle East, I just want to take a second and stress how important it is to support this broadcast and all of InfoWars.
[00:20:53.724 --> 00:20:55.665]  Think about everything this network has done.
[00:20:55.706 --> 00:20:58.827]  It's such an honor to be sitting in this chair in this studio.
[00:20:59.228 --> 00:21:02.710]  This is the network that largely secured President Trump's
[00:21:03.683 --> 00:21:03.763]  Yes.
[00:21:34.624 --> 00:21:38.586]  75% off Total Gut Health Combo Pack with 7 powerful formulas.
[00:21:39.206 --> 00:21:45.270]  50% off Super Male Vitality and it comes with a free bottle of Ultimate Female Force.
[00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:50.612]  63% off the best-selling MycoZX Plus Fungus and Yeast Support.
[00:21:51.213 --> 00:21:53.314]  50% off Ultra 12 Vitamin B12.
[00:21:53.474 --> 00:21:55.775]  I'm a big fan of Ultra 12 Vitamin B12.
[00:21:55.795 --> 00:21:58.457]  The hardest part about traveling is doing without the majority of these.
[00:21:58.977 --> 00:22:03.079]  And then 60% off, Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[00:22:03.099 --> 00:22:04.760]  And I've actually got mine with me here.
[00:22:05.281 --> 00:22:07.942]  I refuse to travel without this stuff.
[00:22:08.222 --> 00:22:09.743]  It's an absolute lifesaver.
[00:22:09.803 --> 00:22:16.787]  I don't know about the folks at home, but whenever I travel, whenever I'm in an airplane for four, six hours, you always get something in your throat.
[00:22:16.807 --> 00:22:18.968]  You always get an upper respiratory something.
[00:22:19.408 --> 00:22:21.449]  And this seems to do the trick at finding that.
[00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.410]  You can also get 50% off bodies.
[00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:27.032]  Many, many other fantastic deals.
[00:22:27.492 --> 00:22:31.353]  Now is the time to take advantage of these great prices.
[00:22:32.093 --> 00:22:34.634]  Many products are already beginning to sell out.
[00:22:34.674 --> 00:22:38.095]  This is your opportunity to support the InfoWars.
[00:22:38.215 --> 00:22:41.036]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:22:42.356 --> 00:22:45.897]  So let's talk about the globalist big dream.
[00:22:45.917 --> 00:22:47.517]  You know, we got rid of John Bolton.
[00:22:47.998 --> 00:22:48.998]  Everybody celebrated.
[00:22:49.038 --> 00:22:50.258]  It seemed like it was going to be great.
[00:22:50.278 --> 00:22:52.919]  I always wonder, is this the revenge of Bolton?
[00:22:53.851 --> 00:23:09.081]  Because now, Israel, which America financially supports and gives weapons to, they're going to have a man who is essentially far left-wing on everything but military, where he is a war hawk.
[00:23:09.602 --> 00:23:20.709]  He could be the next prime minister, and if he is not the next prime minister, then there will be a kingmaker who will force Netanyahu back into attacking Hamas.
[00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.751]  And this all comes up
[00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:35.185]  After National File broke an exclusive story, nationalfile.com, Netanyahu opponent could be blackmailed by Iran, and the Iranian deep state is covering it up.
[00:23:35.786 --> 00:23:37.427]  They have their candidate.
[00:23:38.107 --> 00:23:52.796]  Two sources told the National File the parts of the Israeli government, what some would consider the Israeli deep state, are hiding compromising material that could allow Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu's political opponent, Lieutenant General Benny Gantz, to be blackmailed
[00:23:53.536 --> 00:23:54.037]  By Iran.
[00:23:54.057 --> 00:23:58.441]  You see, Gant, as do many powerful people, he has a vice.
[00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:08.111]  And that vice is apparently, allegedly, according to two sources who came to National File independently, that vice is women.
[00:24:08.352 --> 00:24:09.273]  He has a mistress!
[00:24:10.414 --> 00:24:11.695]  We've certainly heard of this before.
[00:24:11.895 --> 00:24:12.416]  Bill Clinton.
[00:24:12.776 --> 00:24:13.417]  President Trump.
[00:24:14.518 --> 00:24:14.678]  But...
[00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:18.883]  Generally not a good idea to do that when you're running for political office.
[00:24:18.903 --> 00:24:24.065]  So, earlier this year it was widely reported that Iran had hacked Gantz's email.
[00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:31.930]  What was not widely reported is that they gained compromising intel about his mistress.
[00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:38.814]  And what definitely has not been widely reported is that the Israeli Deep State, the Israeli Army, the IDF,
[00:24:39.755 --> 00:24:43.959]  Well, it has a division called the censorship division.
[00:24:44.259 --> 00:24:49.383]  And they decide what flies, what goes out in the public forum within Israel.
[00:24:50.364 --> 00:24:56.969]  And so while this story is out there, multiple Israeli media outlets wanted to report this prior to yesterday's election.
[00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.892]  None were allowed to do so.
[00:25:01.553 --> 00:25:08.099]  And so now, we have this deadlocked election where Netanyahu is not going to be able to secure a majority.
[00:25:09.124 --> 00:25:14.505]  Gantz won't be able to either, but there's going to be a kingmaker who wants nothing more than endless war.
[00:25:14.525 --> 00:25:23.307]  And as we all know, when there's war in the Middle East, somehow the United States always has to get involved.
[00:25:24.648 --> 00:25:34.850]  The censorship division decided that this would pose a national security risk to Israel if it were public that the next prime minister might be blackmailed by Iran.
[00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:37.631]  Is there not some sort of comedic value to that?
[00:25:38.516 --> 00:25:41.397]  And now, we have Iran.
[00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:48.639]  There's a kingmaker, Abigdor Lieberman, who wants to make sure that Israel goes back to war.
[00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:50.800]  Isn't that phenomenal?
[00:25:51.660 --> 00:26:00.043]  And again, I bring this up not to defend Israel, not to say that I think we need to send more money and weapons and everything else to the Middle East for any reason.
[00:26:00.063 --> 00:26:01.643]  I don't want us to give foreign aid to anybody.
[00:26:01.723 --> 00:26:03.384]  Nobody should get foreign aid from the United States.
[00:26:03.444 --> 00:26:04.104]  America first.
[00:26:05.908 --> 00:26:09.749]  I predict this is going to lead to further conflict in the Middle East.
[00:26:10.609 --> 00:26:14.111]  This is from endoftheamericandream, also infowars.com.
[00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:30.115]  Last November, this Lieberman character resigned as Israel's defense minister when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to reject Lieberman's plan for a military operation in Gaza and instead agreed to a ceasefire with Hamas instead.
[00:26:30.836 --> 00:26:34.577]  This man quit his job because there wasn't enough war.
[00:26:36.391 --> 00:26:40.395]  My goodness, if only we could have got rid of John Bolton the same way it took him being fired.
[00:26:41.857 --> 00:26:46.622]  And now, this man is the leader of a party that will serve as the kingmaker.
[00:26:46.702 --> 00:26:49.505]  You see, neither Netanyahu or Gantz have a majority.
[00:26:50.086 --> 00:26:51.407]  They're both stuck in limbo.
[00:26:51.928 --> 00:26:56.953]  And this man is going to get to say, whoever will go to war, you're gonna be the next Prime Minister.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.041]  That's a terrible place to be.
[00:27:00.081 --> 00:27:05.283]  It's a terrible... This is really a result of what happens when the United States allies with these powers.
[00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:10.045]  But say what you will, there are two countries in the Middle East that are really decent places to live.
[00:27:10.486 --> 00:27:15.068]  One of them, the United States, under Hillary and Obama, desperately trying to destroy.
[00:27:15.128 --> 00:27:17.369]  That's, of course, Syria, where they're protecting Christians.
[00:27:17.809 --> 00:27:21.471]  The other is Israel, where they're at least trying to live in peace.
[00:27:22.952 --> 00:27:23.152]  Now,
[00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:25.072]  That may be
[00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:55.394]  Posturing itself for more war in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia says it has material evidence tying Iran to the Aramco attack.
[00:27:57.695 --> 00:28:15.386]  Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that contrary to its initial estimates, Aramco should be able to get back up and going, but the kingdom's defense ministry said it was planning a press conference to present material evidence purportedly linking Tehran to the unprecedented attack on the kingdom's oil infrastructure.
[00:28:17.486 --> 00:28:18.226]  This is another thing.
[00:28:18.246 --> 00:28:26.432]  You know, Tulsi Gabbard, not that I would ever vote Democrat in my life, but she's been pointing out that the United States does not exist to be Saudi Arabia's protector.
[00:28:26.932 --> 00:28:29.193]  She uses a slightly more colorful language than that.
[00:28:30.174 --> 00:28:35.237]  But this is what happens when we depend on a Middle Eastern theocracy for our oil.
[00:28:36.218 --> 00:28:40.721]  I think what needs to happen in this country is we need to continue pursuing energy independence so we can stop
[00:28:42.779 --> 00:28:46.461]  Bowing to Saudi Arabian kings and getting involved in their conflicts.
[00:28:46.481 --> 00:28:49.923]  I think that would be the best course for President Trump to continue to take.
[00:28:49.943 --> 00:28:51.524]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:28:51.885 --> 00:28:53.345]  I'm Tom Pafford filling in for Alex.
[00:28:53.365 --> 00:28:54.466]  He's on his way back.
[00:28:54.686 --> 00:28:56.207]  He might be popping in this afternoon.
[00:28:56.627 --> 00:28:57.268]  Stay tuned.
[00:28:57.328 --> 00:28:58.869]  We'll be back after this break.
[00:29:07.514 --> 00:29:08.735]  We gotta fund this operation.
[00:29:08.755 --> 00:29:10.676]  I came in this morning.
[00:29:12.356 --> 00:29:18.779]  And I said, hey, everybody, what's a great Beto counter shirt?
[00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:20.119]  Like, from our cold, dead hands?
[00:29:20.139 --> 00:29:22.260]  I was like, well, how about from his cold, dead hands?
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.241]  Well, I don't want to threaten him, but that's what's going to happen.
[00:29:24.261 --> 00:29:25.761]  You know, they try to take the guns of civil war.
[00:29:25.781 --> 00:29:26.602]  I mean, how do you do it?
[00:29:26.782 --> 00:29:32.224]  He's got a shirt out he's selling saying, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s and all your other semi-autos.
[00:29:32.364 --> 00:29:37.906]  Well, one of my old friends, the guy that did security work for us, he called up this morning and said, we're in the middle of the show.
[00:29:38.026 --> 00:29:39.147]  He said, I just came up with this design.
[00:29:39.287 --> 00:29:41.048]  He said, how about Beto not?
[00:29:41.368 --> 00:29:41.948]  Beto not.
[00:29:42.368 --> 00:29:47.194]  It's a M4, AR-15, a Texas star above it, but it's an Army star, whatever you like.
[00:29:47.274 --> 00:29:48.415]  And then, Bateau Knot.
[00:29:48.435 --> 00:29:50.357]  These are being printed, already being printed.
[00:29:50.417 --> 00:29:51.999]  And on the back, oh, they already have it, Army Green.
[00:29:52.019 --> 00:29:52.680]  Go down there and click below.
[00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.561]  I guess they already did what I said.
[00:29:53.661 --> 00:29:55.904]  On the back, it says, InfoWars.com.
[00:29:56.064 --> 00:29:57.025]  So, we've already got it.
[00:29:57.485 --> 00:29:58.226]  We've already got it in gray.
[00:29:58.246 --> 00:29:59.147]  We've already got it in army green.
[00:29:59.167 --> 00:30:00.348]  We've got it in darker gray.
[00:30:00.608 --> 00:30:02.210]  And this needs to be a best-seller.
[00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.573]  Exercise your First Amendment in defense of the second or lose it.
[00:30:05.733 --> 00:30:10.338]  And it's a win-win because you're funding this operation that, again, I just want to reach more people.
[00:30:10.698 --> 00:30:11.539]  That's your word of mouth.
[00:30:11.599 --> 00:30:12.780]  And I just want to fund the operation.
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:13.481]  That's your support.
[00:30:13.521 --> 00:30:14.942]  Plus, you get great products you already need.
[00:30:15.763 --> 00:30:16.664]  Take action today.
[00:30:17.124 --> 00:30:19.646]  You know, they came out and abandoned the Betsy Ross flag.
[00:30:19.866 --> 00:30:20.607]  We sold 10,000 of them.
[00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:21.867]  And that sounds like a lot of money.
[00:30:21.908 --> 00:30:24.149]  It's not to run this operation, but to put a lot of the shirts on the streets.
[00:30:24.189 --> 00:30:24.549]  That's great.
[00:30:24.589 --> 00:30:25.210]  Thank you.
[00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.952]  We sold 7,000 of the Space Force shirt that spreads the word.
[00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.353]  It's a nice, comfortable, cool shirt.
[00:30:29.413 --> 00:30:29.653]  Fun.
[00:30:29.733 --> 00:30:33.776]  We sold 100,000 of the Hillary for Prison shirts, but I sold half of them at $5 it cost.
[00:30:33.816 --> 00:30:35.537]  These shirts cost more because they're nicer fabric.
[00:30:35.597 --> 00:30:36.838]  Space Shirts are like $12.
[00:30:37.038 --> 00:30:38.319]  The XXL is even more.
[00:30:38.479 --> 00:30:40.781]  So, these are designer shirts that would be $25, $35 in stores.
[00:30:42.062 --> 00:30:42.382]  I just want
[00:31:04.766 --> 00:31:09.229]  It's not like we're just one of the programs out there fighting them.
[00:31:09.249 --> 00:31:10.750]  We're the one that's got their number.
[00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.651]  They don't like our spirit.
[00:31:12.711 --> 00:31:14.773]  Because believe me, it's the opposite of Satanism.
[00:31:14.793 --> 00:31:21.917]  And it may come off as aggressive and a little hateful sometimes, because it's, you know, that's the Holy Spirit shining through my dirty earth suit.
[00:31:22.978 --> 00:31:23.499]  And you know what?
[00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:28.222]  The truth is, at least out of the Bible and history, most people God used to go after evil.
[00:31:28.542 --> 00:31:29.823]  We're not a bunch of candy asses.
[00:31:30.103 --> 00:31:32.445]  We're not up there all telling you how holy they were all day long.
[00:31:34.879 --> 00:31:37.181]  I'm not just up here to put on some sweetsy act for people.
[00:31:38.462 --> 00:31:39.643]  Because I don't have the energy to do it.
[00:31:41.145 --> 00:31:42.006]  I can't be fake.
[00:31:42.346 --> 00:31:43.287]  I just don't have it in me.
[00:31:44.868 --> 00:31:48.652]  In fact, if anything, I just hold back just how really pissed off I am.
[00:31:49.032 --> 00:31:49.913]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:53.316]  If you're not angry about what's happening, there's something wrong with you.
[00:31:53.736 --> 00:31:54.957]  And I know you're pissed.
[00:31:55.398 --> 00:31:56.759]  Let's put that anger into action.
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:03.600]  Free America Law Center.
[00:32:04.241 --> 00:32:10.504]  We started Free America Law Center because we needed a counterpart to the ACLU and to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:32:11.004 --> 00:32:16.246]  Organizations that have been legal support organizations for political causes on the left for a long time.
[00:32:16.746 --> 00:32:23.409]  But many ordinary Americans, many people on the political right or political independents, did not have that same opportunity afforded them.
[00:32:23.889 --> 00:32:27.031]  So we created the Free America Law Center to help fight back.
[00:32:27.651 --> 00:32:40.242]  Fight back particularly in the areas of big tech deplatforming, big media defamation, big government deep state whistleblowers who need protection against the institutional powers of the establishment.
[00:32:40.622 --> 00:32:43.805]  That's why we created the Free America Law Center to empower you.
[00:32:44.305 --> 00:32:54.774]  You are creating equal access and democratizing the law so that ordinary everyday Americans can fight back against big tech, big media, and big powerful institutions out to deprive them of their rights.
[00:32:55.615 --> 00:33:00.402]  Find out more at FreeAmericaLawCenter.com, where you can become a member today.
[00:33:19.901 --> 00:33:24.894]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:33:25.234 --> 00:33:27.540]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.214 --> 00:33:33.197]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:33.377 --> 00:33:35.960]  I am Tom Pappert filling in for Alex.
[00:33:36.641 --> 00:33:40.785]  The last segment we were talking about what's really going on in the Middle East.
[00:33:40.825 --> 00:33:46.671]  What's really going on with this Israeli election that you're undoubtedly hearing about from every major media source this morning.
[00:33:47.412 --> 00:33:52.437]  So you know what's really happening as it was reported on nationalfile.com and infowars.com.
[00:33:52.477 --> 00:33:52.857]  Let's see
[00:33:53.618 --> 00:33:57.519]  What the globalist propaganda engine at AP News.
[00:33:57.879 --> 00:33:58.999]  Let's see what they have to say.
[00:33:59.039 --> 00:34:08.182]  So we just heard, just to recap, that there is now a kingmaker party in Israel that is going to demand war with Hamas.
[00:34:08.202 --> 00:34:13.984]  They're going to demand essentially genocide of Palestine in all likelihood.
[00:34:14.484 --> 00:34:18.505]  But this is the absolute insanity that's being put out by AP.
[00:34:19.005 --> 00:34:22.386]  Israel's Arabs poised to gain a new voice.
[00:34:23.268 --> 00:34:25.489]  After a tight election, isn't that great?
[00:34:25.509 --> 00:34:30.851]  You've got to remember, here in the United States, they're saying, no walls from Mexico to Palestine.
[00:34:32.352 --> 00:34:34.493]  No border, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:38.495]  This is insanity, what we're seeing right here.
[00:34:38.515 --> 00:34:43.937]  But this is what they want the world to believe in this Tuesday
[00:34:45.197 --> 00:34:46.738]  Isn't that lovely?
[00:34:47.399 --> 00:34:49.500]  Doesn't that just sound so lovely?
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.142]  It's almost like it's not true.
[00:35:12.748 --> 00:35:25.991]  Near-complete results Wednesday indicated the Joint List won about a dozen seats in the 120-member assembly, coming third after the Blue and White Party of former military chief Benny Gantz and the right-wing Likud Party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:35:26.011 --> 00:35:31.092]  In absolute terms, the Arab bloc appears to have met or fallen short of its performance in 2015.
[00:35:31.452 --> 00:35:42.274]  But this time around, due to shifting constellation of Israeli politics, it would be well-placed to lead the opposition if a national unity government of the two largest parties is formed, as seems
[00:35:42.694 --> 00:35:43.074]  Likely.
[00:35:45.115 --> 00:35:48.597]  This is insanity that they're reporting this as if it's some wonder.
[00:35:48.617 --> 00:35:50.478]  This could mean the death of these people.
[00:35:50.998 --> 00:35:52.879]  That is what this election actually means.
[00:35:52.939 --> 00:35:55.960]  But they report it as though it's a wonderful thing.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.321]  It's multiculturalism.
[00:35:57.361 --> 00:36:00.923]  It's everybody's getting together in a circle and singing, Kumbaya!
[00:36:02.247 --> 00:36:06.630]  Meanwhile, we could have a world war erupt in the Middle East any day now.
[00:36:07.511 --> 00:36:12.854]  As guns are pointed toward Iran, we're pointing it back toward Saudi Arabia.
[00:36:13.615 --> 00:36:18.678]  And by the way, on Big Tech, this just shows the allegiance of these people.
[00:36:18.738 --> 00:36:26.064]  Facebook is still auto-generating results for the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda in terms of pages.
[00:36:26.824 --> 00:36:28.705]  You can see they're on screen for the document cam.
[00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:30.607]  I love Islamic State!
[00:36:32.185 --> 00:36:33.365]  Isn't that insane?
[00:36:33.885 --> 00:36:35.886]  That's our big tech overlords for you.
[00:36:36.806 --> 00:36:37.346]  Right there.
[00:36:39.046 --> 00:36:42.127]  But this does, I mean, this, again, who on earth does this?
[00:36:42.487 --> 00:36:46.508]  Pages from a confidential whistleblower's report obtained by the Associated Press.
[00:36:46.528 --> 00:36:49.769]  Who goes to the AP with your whistleblower's report?
[00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:55.190]  Along with two printed Facebook pages that were active on Tuesday, September 17th, are photographed in Washington.
[00:36:56.411 --> 00:37:11.256]  Facebook likes to say that its automated systems remove the vast majority of prohibited content glorifying the Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda before it's reported, but a whistleblower's complaint shows that Facebook itself has inadvertently produced dozens of pages in their names.
[00:37:12.177 --> 00:37:16.398]  These are the algorithms that are meant to rule our lives and make everything work.
[00:37:17.238 --> 00:37:17.839]  Isn't that lovely?
[00:37:17.879 --> 00:37:24.361]  The algorithms that were attempted to be gamed for Hillary Clinton, the algorithms that are now being gamed for
[00:37:25.845 --> 00:37:28.927]  The new crop of Democrats, as insane as they all might be.
[00:37:29.748 --> 00:37:34.491]  But speaking of Hillary Clinton, you know, largely what's happening in the Middle East is due to her policies.
[00:37:34.551 --> 00:37:36.833]  I mean, it was her and Obama who created ISIS.
[00:37:37.893 --> 00:37:41.276]  It was, of course, Hillary who destabilized much of North Africa.
[00:37:41.316 --> 00:37:50.462]  She's the reason why you, if you had the money and the inclination and the lack of morality, you could go to Libya today and buy a black slave.
[00:37:51.479 --> 00:37:55.024]  He eradicated slavery in the West and Hillary Clinton brought it back in Libya.
[00:37:55.044 --> 00:37:55.685]  Isn't that nice?
[00:37:55.725 --> 00:38:05.298]  Well, Hillary Clinton, this is an article up at Infowars.com, Steve Watson, she is still complaining that she lost to Trump.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.160]  When is this lady going to get over it?
[00:38:09.621 --> 00:38:13.521]  It's honestly pathetic at this point, but this article is absolutely insane.
[00:38:13.581 --> 00:38:20.743]  She has apparently been mentoring some of the Democrat candidates to run against Trump in 2020.
[00:38:21.063 --> 00:38:23.984]  That's sure to please all Trump supporters everywhere.
[00:38:25.664 --> 00:38:26.645]  Can we roll this video?
[00:38:27.265 --> 00:38:28.785]  I'm fascinated by this lady.
[00:38:28.825 --> 00:38:30.186]  I don't know why she's still out there.
[00:38:30.226 --> 00:38:31.766]  She should be hiding under a rock by now.
[00:38:34.494 --> 00:38:39.379]  So, I've talked with many of the Democratic candidates for president, as you might guess.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:47.626]  I've answered their questions about everything from digital outreach... So, she's talking to these people, she's answering their questions.
[00:38:47.926 --> 00:38:55.273]  Who better to consult with for your campaign than the losing candidate who lost a rigged election?
[00:38:57.395 --> 00:39:00.458]  ...obstacle might very well turn out to be, and that...
[00:39:04.272 --> 00:39:05.873]  I'm mesmerized by this.
[00:39:05.933 --> 00:39:07.314]  The fact that she is still going.
[00:39:07.954 --> 00:39:09.255]  Still running her mouth.
[00:39:09.775 --> 00:39:13.578]  She warned the Russians are coming to meddle in the election yet again.
[00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:25.146]  We have a fundamental set of threats at the bedrock of our democracy and anyone who stands in the way of confronting those threats is abdicating their responsibility to protect and defend the Constitution.
[00:39:25.266 --> 00:39:29.749]  I was the first person who ran for president in more than 50 years without the protection of the Voting Rights Act.
[00:39:29.769 --> 00:39:31.230]  She also complained.
[00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.751]  What a complete
[00:39:36.133 --> 00:39:39.295]  And the fact that she's consulting with the new crop of Democrats doesn't surprise me.
[00:39:39.315 --> 00:39:43.819]  I mean, look, we all know that social media, everything was tilted in her favor in 2016.
[00:39:44.259 --> 00:39:47.481]  And just think about what's happened over the last few years.
[00:39:48.182 --> 00:39:52.285]  Let's go ahead and start to get into this because it's absolutely horrifying.
[00:39:53.001 --> 00:40:14.733]  A couple weeks ago I was here in studio with Alex and you may remember we were reporting on the potential new gun control push that will weaponize your Alexa, your Fitbit, your everything, to spy on you, give that information to the government, and then allow the government to do one of two things, either come and take your guns, or put you on prescription SSRIs, or both.
[00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.781]  Well now, new article up at Zero Hedge, it's up at Infowars.com as well.
[00:40:20.322 --> 00:40:26.104]  Smart TVs have been caught sending sensitive user data to Facebook and Netflix.
[00:40:26.144 --> 00:40:30.125]  You know, every single day Alex Jones is completely vindicated.
[00:40:30.165 --> 00:40:38.388]  I remember when I was a kid, I was a child, and Alex was saying, look, these devices are listening to you, it's already in the patents, go look it up for yourself.
[00:40:39.246 --> 00:40:40.126]  And now here it is.
[00:40:40.847 --> 00:40:41.827]  Mainstream news.
[00:40:42.388 --> 00:40:51.852]  Just when social media companies were starting to modify their data collection practices to better respect user privacy, the next threat is coming from the Internet of Things.
[00:40:52.312 --> 00:40:54.313]  Smart TVs are becoming increasingly popular.
[00:40:54.333 --> 00:40:58.415]  In some cases, users' data are being sent to Netflix even though they didn't have an account.
[00:40:58.635 --> 00:40:59.816]  This is kind of like with Facebook.
[00:41:00.176 --> 00:41:05.299]  Facebook can mine your user data even if you've never had a Facebook account in your life.
[00:41:06.212 --> 00:41:07.372]  And it's not just smart TVs.
[00:41:07.452 --> 00:41:13.034]  Other smart devices from speakers to cameras have also been caught sending user data to third parties like Spotify.
[00:41:13.854 --> 00:41:18.115]  Nearly 70% of Americans have a smart TV or a Roku or Apple TV.
[00:41:18.595 --> 00:41:26.477]  Nearly all these devices have recognition technology that tracks what you watch and sells that data, approximating your interest to advertisers.
[00:41:26.497 --> 00:41:31.078]  You know, viewers who watch Firepower, which is on every night from 7 until 9 p.m.
[00:41:31.098 --> 00:41:34.699]  with myself and Will Johnson, know that I've been building a new studio there.
[00:41:35.639 --> 00:41:48.405]  And when you're shopping for TVs, this is how it works now I learned, you can choose to get a dumb TV and you can pay $1,200, or you can get a smart TV and pay $600.
[00:41:48.785 --> 00:41:55.788]  And it doesn't take a genius to sit there and think, what on earth is the difference between these two TVs?
[00:41:55.848 --> 00:41:58.129]  It's the same exact size, the same exact technology.
[00:41:58.469 --> 00:41:59.990]  One's a smart TV and it's cheaper.
[00:42:01.181 --> 00:42:04.545]  And one is a dumb TV and it costs twice the amount of money.
[00:42:05.106 --> 00:42:14.597]  Could it be that they're stealing my data to spy on me and sell it to whoever is paying the most and that subsidizes the cost?
[00:42:15.178 --> 00:42:17.481]  This isn't exactly hard stuff to understand, but...
[00:42:18.914 --> 00:42:20.515]  Apparently most Americans don't care.
[00:42:20.535 --> 00:42:21.676]  I think that's the real problem.
[00:42:21.696 --> 00:42:22.637]  We're all numb to this.
[00:42:22.717 --> 00:42:25.620]  Everybody just knows that your smartphone is spying on you.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.622]  You mention a word and two days later it's in a Facebook ad.
[00:42:28.663 --> 00:42:29.623]  You never even type it.
[00:42:29.643 --> 00:42:30.664]  You never do a Google search.
[00:42:30.684 --> 00:42:36.689]  We all just kind of accept this as the price that we pay to live in this wonderful advanced society.
[00:42:36.709 --> 00:42:39.692]  We're gonna talk more about this when we come back after the break.
[00:42:39.752 --> 00:42:41.233]  Big Tech is one of the major
[00:42:42.796 --> 00:42:49.561]  Destructive forces of our time and nobody, it seems like nobody is trying to reign it in whatsoever.
[00:42:49.621 --> 00:42:51.763]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:42:51.923 --> 00:42:55.666]  I'm Tom Pampert filling in for Alex as he returns from California.
[00:42:55.686 --> 00:42:57.147]  He's on a very big podcast.
[00:42:57.227 --> 00:42:58.609]  Keep an eye out for that.
[00:42:58.969 --> 00:43:00.730]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:43:08.104 --> 00:43:11.226]  I don't have to tell this audience that you're amazing.
[00:43:11.386 --> 00:43:24.414]  Without you, InfoWars would not have been here to relaunch Americana in the last decade and to relaunch Americana as a challenge to the globalist narrative of a godless, anti-human, anti-family world government.
[00:43:24.534 --> 00:43:26.576]  But I do need to remind you that you are.
[00:43:27.056 --> 00:43:27.536]  You're the engine.
[00:43:27.936 --> 00:43:28.937]  You're the wind in our sails.
[00:43:28.977 --> 00:43:32.319]  You are the blood in the veins and arteries of this operation.
[00:43:32.459 --> 00:43:33.780]  You're the eyes and ears on the ground.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.601]  You are the soul of the resistance to tyranny.
[00:43:36.821 --> 00:43:37.542]  And I know you're humble.
[00:43:37.802 --> 00:43:43.925]  I know you're just the salt of the earth people all across this country and all across this world of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and love God and love justice.
[00:43:44.165 --> 00:43:55.151]  And I'm here to tell you, your word of mouth spreading the fact that InfoWars is still on the air, person to person, via email, via text message, via Facebook, Twitter, and all the major enemy sites has changed the world and it's going to change the world again.
[00:43:55.211 --> 00:43:56.732]  They want InfoWars out of the fight.
[00:43:56.932 --> 00:43:59.933]  They want us to give up and roll over and crawl into a hole and die.
[00:44:00.013 --> 00:44:00.753]  We're not going to do it.
[00:44:00.813 --> 00:44:04.455]  We're going to continue fighting on because now more than ever, we are vindicated.
[00:44:04.595 --> 00:44:12.118]  Those of you that have spread the word about the New World Order, about the private Federal Reserve, about the pedophile rigs that run the planet, about the Satanism in its operating system, you've done it all.
[00:44:12.178 --> 00:44:14.579]  You exposed the fluoride given as cancer in Lorne RRQ's.
[00:44:14.759 --> 00:44:16.739]  You exposed the GMO and the glyphosate.
[00:44:16.799 --> 00:44:18.080]  You've all been vindicated.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.721]  You exposed the drag queen story time as pedo time.
[00:44:20.981 --> 00:44:27.123]  You exposed the fact that radical Islam is orthodox Islam, that the globalists are funding it to tear down what's left of the Christian West.
[00:44:27.423 --> 00:44:30.504]  You are the reason we're here today, all of us together.
[00:44:30.664 --> 00:44:31.465]  You are the InfoWar.
[00:44:31.905 --> 00:44:34.126]  That's a literal statement, that's not figurative.
[00:44:34.146 --> 00:44:40.208]  And so, without you spreading the word, financially supporting the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen, we're not going to be here.
[00:44:40.628 --> 00:44:45.770]  So again, I commend you, I salute you, and I want to remind you, InfoWarStore.com to get great products and fund this operation.
[00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:08.491]  We started InfoWars live seven years ago, and now we've got more than 60 products.
[00:45:08.631 --> 00:45:15.853]  And I've done a pretty good job rolling most of them out, but one place I haven't is Happy's Mood and Stress.
[00:45:16.154 --> 00:45:24.996]  The system knows that what Mother Nature has given us works way better than what the toxic Big Pharma has been trying to push the population.
[00:45:25.816 --> 00:45:28.377]  That's why the FDA and others work so hard
[00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:40.215]  To keep the knowledge from the people that just walking in the hills or the mountains or by a river for even a few hours a week has been shown in hundreds of conclusive studies.
[00:45:41.075 --> 00:45:45.699]  To boost your mood, to boost your spirit, and to be good for you physically.
[00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:48.281]  The Japanese do this thousands of years ago.
[00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:50.282]  It's called forest bathing.
[00:45:50.603 --> 00:46:00.651]  So there's something you can do that's basically absolutely free, or the amount of energy it'll take you to ride your bike to the forest, or the amount of gas it'll take you to drive your truck out to the beach.
[00:46:01.598 --> 00:46:09.305]  But that said, Happys has become, on average, about our fifth best-selling product with no promotion.
[00:46:10.186 --> 00:46:14.469]  And it's got hundreds and hundreds of five stars because people are blown away by it.
[00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:22.657]  You see, it's got cold-pressed, known herbs that different cultures around the world have used for thousands of years.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.141]  Let me read over some of this for you.
[00:46:25.441 --> 00:46:33.565]  Ashwagandha root, rhodiola root, passionflower herb, green tea leaf, and licorice root.
[00:46:33.665 --> 00:46:35.166]  Happies is an amazing formula.
[00:46:35.606 --> 00:46:38.528]  It's already in our top best sellers, but I'm offering it
[00:46:39.348 --> 00:46:41.089]  For 50% off right now.
[00:46:41.409 --> 00:46:42.589]  For store dot com.
[00:46:42.729 --> 00:46:44.390]  Because I want you to experience it.
[00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.911]  And also it spurs people to buy the products when we massively discount them.
[00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:50.931]  So we've got to sell a lot of products to fund our operation when we discount it like this.
[00:46:51.352 --> 00:46:52.952]  But still, overall, it's working out.
[00:46:53.412 --> 00:46:59.094]  Whatever you do, have a passion driven, have a purpose driven life and support InfoWorks.
[00:46:59.114 --> 00:47:00.234]  So get your happy today.
[00:47:00.254 --> 00:47:02.695]  50% off at InfoWorks store dot com.
[00:47:05.174 --> 00:47:09.277]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:09.778 --> 00:47:11.099]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:28.771]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:28.811 --> 00:47:32.112]  Again, I am Tom Fabert filling in for Alex as he gets his way back here.
[00:47:32.172 --> 00:47:36.034]  He may be back in studio at one o'clock, so stay tuned.
[00:47:36.734 --> 00:47:51.781]  We've been talking about big tech and I really want to go big picture here because big tech is working hand in hand with our globalist overlords to create this new perfect paradigm that they want to usher in that is not a human paradigm but
[00:47:52.441 --> 00:48:01.904]  This is a just, this is an important article because Facebook, this is really them flaunting their power over the legal system, over Congress, over everybody.
[00:48:02.244 --> 00:48:05.185]  Everybody knows Laura Loomer is suing Facebook.
[00:48:05.205 --> 00:48:08.126]  You may remember her appearance on the Alex Jones Show from a few months back.
[00:48:09.127 --> 00:48:13.908]  She is suing Facebook because Facebook has considered Laura Loomer a hate figure.
[00:48:14.769 --> 00:48:21.371]  She's a 5'7 Jewish girl but she's a hate figure according to Facebook and she must be banned!
[00:48:22.148 --> 00:48:31.535]  She's every bit as bad as Alex Jones, or Paul Joseph Watson, or that dangerous white supremacist Milo Yiannopoulos, who coincidentally is married to a black guy.
[00:48:32.996 --> 00:48:38.500]  So in that lawsuit, Facebook has now filed a motion to dismiss.
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:47.166]  And it is perhaps the most confusing motion to dismiss I have ever read in my entire adult life, which admittedly is not that long.
[00:48:47.206 --> 00:48:48.286]  Maybe there's something crazier.
[00:48:48.547 --> 00:48:49.447]  Somebody can show it to me.
[00:48:49.467 --> 00:48:51.209]  But this was something else.
[00:48:51.949 --> 00:49:08.038]  So in its response to independent journalist Laura Loomer's lawsuit against the platform, Facebook refers to itself as a publisher, which means it could potentially forego protections afforded to all big tech, all social media networks, by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.
[00:49:08.058 --> 00:49:20.725]  So for people who don't know how this works, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, they're all in this bizarre world, middle line area, where they're not a publisher, they're not a newspaper, because a newspaper
[00:49:21.365 --> 00:49:25.627]  If a newspaper publishes libel, you can sue the pants off that newspaper.
[00:49:25.767 --> 00:49:26.967]  You can make it bold.
[00:49:27.907 --> 00:49:32.869]  So they're not a newspaper, they're not a publisher, but at the same time it's not a public forum.
[00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:37.791]  They can ban anyone they want without it being a violation of the First Amendment.
[00:49:37.831 --> 00:49:48.915]  So, in this bizarre world, clown world, legal document, they somehow managed to make the case that they are indeed a publisher, but they're not a publisher.
[00:49:49.997 --> 00:49:50.718]  Motion to dismiss.
[00:49:51.198 --> 00:49:57.762]  Loomer's lawsuit against the big tech company Facebook's legal counsel appears to specifically refer to the company as a publisher.
[00:49:57.782 --> 00:49:58.223]  It says this.
[00:49:58.623 --> 00:49:59.804]  Third, to the extent Ms.
[00:49:59.844 --> 00:50:04.267]  Loomer's claim targets Facebook's decision to deactivate her accounts, it is also deficient.
[00:50:04.767 --> 00:50:12.873]  Under well-established laws, neither Facebook nor any other publisher can be liable for failing to publish someone else's message.
[00:50:13.473 --> 00:50:15.795]  So here, Facebook is saying, we're a newspaper.
[00:50:16.716 --> 00:50:18.477]  It's just like at InfoWars.com.
[00:50:19.634 --> 00:50:27.202]  Nobody has the right to just send an article to Infowars or Newswars.com and have it published.
[00:50:27.522 --> 00:50:28.003]  That's true.
[00:50:29.024 --> 00:50:30.665]  But Facebook says it's not a publisher.
[00:50:30.765 --> 00:50:31.987]  Anybody can go to Facebook.
[00:50:32.327 --> 00:50:33.368]  But they can ban people.
[00:50:33.748 --> 00:50:34.890]  But anybody can go to Facebook.
[00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:47.375]  Strangely, later in the motion, Facebook then invokes Section 230, and what Reclaim the Net, which I'm a big fan of that website, it seems to be a great civil liberty on the internet website, describes as a mind-boggling stance.
[00:50:47.415 --> 00:50:57.678]  Facebook's mind-boggling claim that its First Member rights allow it to ban users for exercising their own First Member rights, and that's not even the only puzzling and contradictory point from the filing.
[00:50:57.718 --> 00:51:03.621]  Another is the way Facebook refers to itself as a publisher at one point, only to later, in the same document, invoke Section 230.
[00:51:04.821 --> 00:51:05.442]  To the extent Ms.
[00:51:05.482 --> 00:51:10.448]  Loomer's claim targets Facebook, nor any other publisher can be liable.
[00:51:10.468 --> 00:51:22.243]  And then it goes on to describe itself on page 18 as a company that is protected by section 230 of the Communication Decency Act.
[00:51:24.147 --> 00:51:25.148]  It's totally insane.
[00:51:25.848 --> 00:51:30.111]  I love that we got this on the document cam because this is where Facebook is leading us.
[00:51:30.151 --> 00:51:32.612]  This is where all these insane people are leading us.
[00:51:32.632 --> 00:51:36.635]  This is another article from by Paul and Joseph Watson up at Infowars.com.
[00:51:36.675 --> 00:51:49.743]  Governments are not prepared for a pandemic that could kill 80 million people, warns the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, a joint entity formed by the World Bank and the WHO.
[00:51:51.479 --> 00:51:59.083]  This is the die-off, the great murder of humanity that Alex Jones has always been talking about.
[00:52:00.244 --> 00:52:01.365]  And they want it to happen.
[00:52:01.945 --> 00:52:16.294]  There is a very real threat of a rapidly moving, highly lethal pandemic of a respiratory pathogen killing 50 to 80 million people and wiping out nearly 5% of the world's economy, warns the paper, adding that the world is not prepared for this.
[00:52:17.253 --> 00:52:23.156]  A global pandemic on that scale would be catastrophic, creating widespread havoc, instability, and insecurity.
[00:52:23.856 --> 00:52:34.502]  The GPMB says governments need to invest more in emergency preparedness, and that misinformation on social media is also exacerbating the spread of diseases.
[00:52:35.722 --> 00:52:36.302]  But don't worry.
[00:52:37.743 --> 00:52:39.204]  Trump is being pressured to ban vaping.
[00:52:40.024 --> 00:52:40.945]  And that will solve everything.
[00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:43.106]  So mosquito-borne virus
[00:52:44.312 --> 00:52:48.434]  Could be a form, not this, but a form of what kills people.
[00:52:48.874 --> 00:52:54.197]  A man went from healthy to brain dead in nine days from a mosquito-borne virus.
[00:52:54.217 --> 00:53:03.101]  64-year-old man was a perfectly healthy, happy human being less than two weeks before his August 19 death from a rare mosquito-borne virus.
[00:53:04.922 --> 00:53:06.543]  Here's a comforting headline.
[00:53:07.824 --> 00:53:08.684]  Are you guys ready for this?
[00:53:09.244 --> 00:53:12.126]  This year's flu season may be a bad one.
[00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:14.230]  Here's why you need a flu shot.
[00:53:15.271 --> 00:53:17.391]  Are you ready for your flu shots, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:53:17.831 --> 00:53:23.853]  Flu seasons are notoriously unpredictable, but there are already clues that the upcoming season may be especially difficult.
[00:53:24.533 --> 00:53:27.834]  Flu season in the Southern Hemisphere can be an indication of what's to come in the Northern Hemisphere.
[00:53:27.854 --> 00:53:32.055]  In the recent flu season in Australia, where winter just ended, arrived early and with a vengeance!
[00:53:32.695 --> 00:53:35.096]  A particularly virulent flu strain, H3N2, dominated
[00:53:37.554 --> 00:53:40.317]  What's more, pediatric flu death has already been reported in the U.S.
[00:53:40.377 --> 00:53:43.379]  A four-year-old in California who had underlying health problems.
[00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.802]  That's the part that they never put in the headline, is it?
[00:53:46.622 --> 00:53:47.944]  Underlying health problems.
[00:53:48.004 --> 00:53:49.565]  The very young who are already sick.
[00:53:49.585 --> 00:53:50.966]  The very old who are already sick.
[00:53:51.847 --> 00:53:52.968]  But you better get your flu shot.
[00:53:53.971 --> 00:54:01.517]  We should never forget that the flu kills, said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, a public health officer for Riverside County, California.
[00:54:02.077 --> 00:54:05.700]  A death so early in the flu season suggests this year may be worse than usual.
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:09.063]  CDC estimates that last year there were 37 million to 43 million flu illnesses, 36,000 to 61,000 related deaths.
[00:54:18.646 --> 00:54:19.906]  So you better get your flu shot.
[00:54:19.926 --> 00:54:20.666]  Here we go.
[00:54:21.427 --> 00:54:27.508]  The concern with delaying it is that some people who might have the opportunity to get vaccinated now may not have that opportunity later.
[00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:32.209]  That's Dr. Robert Atmar, professor of medicine and infectious disease expert at Baylor College.
[00:54:32.729 --> 00:54:36.649]  The most important thing is for people to get their flu vaccine and get it before the epidemic starts.
[00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:44.791]  Most healthy people get the shot in September and can expect some protection through the spring, but older adults may want to schedule their vaccination for sometime in October.
[00:54:47.551 --> 00:54:49.792]  There's no mention of what the flu shot actually does.
[00:54:49.832 --> 00:54:53.374]  It protects against one very specific strain of the flu.
[00:54:53.414 --> 00:54:56.155]  And who even knows what the strain that you could get sick with will be.
[00:54:56.215 --> 00:54:57.396]  It's all total insanity.
[00:54:57.436 --> 00:55:00.037]  But this is then the globalist agenda.
[00:55:00.077 --> 00:55:01.718]  We're all going to get sick and die of the flu.
[00:55:01.918 --> 00:55:02.959]  Mosquitoes are biting us.
[00:55:02.979 --> 00:55:03.499]  We're going to die.
[00:55:03.519 --> 00:55:06.060]  There's a respiratory illness that's going to take out 80 million people.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:12.344]  But the elites want us to live in 100 square foot parasite pods.
[00:55:13.324 --> 00:55:15.105]  And it's the housing of the future.
[00:55:16.476 --> 00:55:25.526]  Of course, Paul Joseph Watson had a similar article and a video that went along with it last week, but this is up at nationalfile.com, and this is the future.
[00:55:25.606 --> 00:55:26.347]  This is what they want.
[00:55:26.387 --> 00:55:27.107]  Maybe we can, uh...
[00:55:28.134 --> 00:55:32.239]  Put some of the images on screen from an article that's embedded in this one.
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.221]  This is what they want for us.
[00:55:34.241 --> 00:55:37.785]  We're going to live in these 100 to 180 square foot pods.
[00:55:38.666 --> 00:55:40.047]  These tiny little homes.
[00:55:40.768 --> 00:55:46.455]  And if you look at these things, it looks like a wasp nest on the side of somebody else's building.
[00:55:48.697 --> 00:55:58.764]  Parasite pods are part of a broader design subclass called parasitic architecture, defined as temporary structures that feed off energy from a host building to provide power, utilities, structural support.
[00:55:59.605 --> 00:56:03.367]  Some aesthetically disturbing examples can be seen online.
[00:56:04.568 --> 00:56:14.155]  And this is being put forward in China, in Spain, in Malaysia, all across the world, as the next step.
[00:56:14.858 --> 00:56:15.799]  In human evolution.
[00:56:16.559 --> 00:56:25.064]  So I know we don't have much time here, but let's see exactly what this type of living conditions brings with clip number five.
[00:56:25.364 --> 00:56:28.786]  This is what happens when people are destitute and living in close quarters.
[00:56:30.367 --> 00:56:31.308]  We can bring that up.
[00:56:31.368 --> 00:56:31.848]  There we go.
[00:56:38.612 --> 00:56:42.194]  Homeless people fighting over who knows what.
[00:56:43.362 --> 00:56:47.403]  I believe this happened right here in Austin, if I understand correctly.
[00:56:48.303 --> 00:56:50.124]  Texas Street Fights TV.
[00:56:50.944 --> 00:56:51.444]  My goodness.
[00:56:52.144 --> 00:56:53.544]  These are some of the lovely campers.
[00:56:53.584 --> 00:56:59.266]  You know, they just need a nice parasitic home and maybe a flu vaccine and all will go well.
[00:57:01.226 --> 00:57:03.067]  This is disgusting footage.
[00:57:04.747 --> 00:57:07.608]  This is what humanity is being degraded to.
[00:57:09.408 --> 00:57:11.729]  Thanks to our globalist overlords here.
[00:57:13.081 --> 00:57:14.522]  Alright, I think we've seen enough.
[00:57:14.602 --> 00:57:20.464]  We better stop it before it gets unfriendly for a family audience, but this is what the globalists want.
[00:57:20.504 --> 00:57:23.085]  I mean, IQ has plummeted over the past few decades.
[00:57:23.986 --> 00:57:25.366]  Fluoride had a lot to do with that.
[00:57:26.287 --> 00:57:34.990]  This is the type of behavior, this is the type of living conditions, this is the type of illnesses that they're going to continue to force upon us if we don't fight back.
[00:57:35.691 --> 00:57:37.932]  InfoWars.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:39.366 --> 00:57:40.408]  NewsWorse.com.
[00:57:40.589 --> 00:57:41.490]  I'm Tom Papperts.
[00:57:41.711 --> 00:57:43.114]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:43.274 --> 00:57:45.699]  Alex should be back in studio later today.
[00:57:46.481 --> 00:57:47.082]  Stay tuned.
[00:57:47.102 --> 00:57:50.048]  We're back with Patrick Howley on the other side of this break.
[00:58:01.733 --> 00:58:06.896]  Josh in Washington.
[00:58:06.916 --> 00:58:07.417]  You're on the air.
[00:58:07.457 --> 00:58:07.777]  Go ahead.
[00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:09.178]  Alex, God bless you.
[00:58:09.318 --> 00:58:11.699]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:58:11.759 --> 00:58:16.782]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[00:58:16.802 --> 00:58:17.302]  Ooh, yeah.
[00:58:18.383 --> 00:58:19.724]  Showing your brain, getting fried.
[00:58:19.744 --> 00:58:21.544]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[00:58:21.584 --> 00:58:22.485]  Totally changed my life.
[00:58:22.645 --> 00:58:29.127]  I use Turbo Force, Body Ease, Alpha Power, Brain Force, Fish Oil, Ultra 12 daily, X2 every several days now.
[00:58:29.427 --> 00:58:37.650]  And what I've found is really combining them is a totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:41.071]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not?
[00:58:41.111 --> 00:58:43.132]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known.
[00:58:43.612 --> 00:58:44.252]  To be incredible.
[00:58:44.292 --> 00:58:50.914]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[00:58:51.074 --> 00:58:53.475]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel in the body.
[00:58:53.555 --> 00:58:55.956]  People think just dumping energy drinks on it will do something.
[00:58:55.976 --> 00:58:57.836]  No, if your base isn't there, none of it works.
[00:58:57.856 --> 00:59:00.917]  But you take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:02.798]  Now you can build the big, strong temple.
[00:59:02.818 --> 00:59:03.898]  It's not that I'm perfect either.
[00:59:03.938 --> 00:59:04.978]  I treat my body really bad.
[00:59:05.018 --> 00:59:09.160]  But with these products I take, and I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.921]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[00:59:11.941 --> 00:59:12.681]  Thank you so much.
[00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:13.241]  God bless you.
[00:59:26.023 --> 00:59:29.086]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[00:59:29.226 --> 00:59:32.268]  Now, we're bringing you an all-new version to help you reach your energy peak.
[00:59:32.448 --> 00:59:39.774]  Ultra 12 from InfoWars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[00:59:39.954 --> 00:59:46.359]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[00:59:46.499 --> 00:59:50.202]  Take advantage of the superior form of B12 and head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:59:55.276 --> 01:00:01.242]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.806 --> 01:00:13.455]  He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine.
[01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:22.319]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:22.439 --> 01:00:23.900]  I am Tom Pappard, your host.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:37.527]  In the beginning of the last hour, we were talking about Ed Buck, who has now been arrested after three men that we know of have reportedly overdosed after he allegedly injected crystal meth into their body.
[01:00:38.047 --> 01:00:43.570]  One victim says he does it so he can feed off the energy of young black men who are in distress.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:48.522]  For this segment, and maybe the next few, we're going to have Patrick Howley with us.
[01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:52.444]  Patrick Howley is a reporter for Epoch Times, as well as my website, National File.
[01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:56.485]  Patrick has previously been at Breitbart, Big League Politics, Daily Caller.
[01:00:56.786 --> 01:01:00.327]  He is a heavy hitter when it comes to these topics.
[01:01:00.887 --> 01:01:03.809]  One of my favorite people at Howley Reporter on Twitter.
[01:01:03.949 --> 01:01:04.929]  Make sure you follow him.
[01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:10.032]  Patrick was instrumental in breaking down everything that happened with NXIVM.
[01:01:10.652 --> 01:01:14.775]  The famous sex cult that was really a human trafficking cult.
[01:01:14.815 --> 01:01:19.699]  Patrick also was instrumental in helping the world understand what was going on with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:01:19.739 --> 01:01:22.661]  So I thought, who better to bring into this conversation?
[01:01:23.021 --> 01:01:25.703]  Patrick, I know you're familiar with what happened with Ed Buck.
[01:01:26.123 --> 01:01:28.485]  What do you consider his arrest?
[01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.007]  What do you view this as?
[01:01:31.067 --> 01:01:32.408]  Is this a step in the right direction?
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:34.721]  Well, you would think so.
[01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:42.628]  I mean, you would think he would have been arrested after the first black man died at his home after being overdosing, after being injected with crystal meth.
[01:01:43.028 --> 01:01:46.151]  You would have thought he would have been arrested after the second black man died at his home.
[01:01:46.511 --> 01:01:48.032]  Now, this third man did not die.
[01:01:48.112 --> 01:01:48.853]  He survived.
[01:01:49.193 --> 01:01:57.741]  However, this is enough to get Ed Buck charged with battery causing serious injury, administering meth, and maintaining a drug house.
[01:01:58.121 --> 01:02:00.142]  So he is finally being brought to justice.
[01:02:00.162 --> 01:02:01.163]  These are felony counts.
[01:02:01.523 --> 01:02:05.566]  He is, of course, a Hillary Clinton donor and a very close friend of the Clintons.
[01:02:05.846 --> 01:02:19.435]  And so this is yet another person who's in the Clinton nexus, who has been accused in a civil suit of human trafficking, who is obviously preying on black men and, you know, taking pleasure and delight in their suffering and their misery.
[01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:24.679]  This is something we often see from elitists who are involved in human trafficking, who are connected to the Clintons.
[01:02:24.739 --> 01:02:27.781]  They thrive on the suffering of their victims.
[01:02:28.741 --> 01:02:34.845]  Now you brought up a really important connection there because it does seem as if they are all connected to the Clintons in some way shape or form.
[01:02:34.865 --> 01:02:38.247]  We of course had Jeffrey Epstein intimately acquainted with the Clintons.
[01:02:38.528 --> 01:02:44.872]  We had the NXIVM human trafficking sex cult where they were giving illegal donations to Clinton in 2008.
[01:02:45.312 --> 01:02:48.074]  And now we have Ed Buck who is their super donor.
[01:02:48.094 --> 01:02:53.617]  So is this, in your view, is this just a commonality between elites and
[01:02:55.503 --> 01:02:59.507]  Well, it's a network, and it's a network of people who are all connected with one another.
[01:02:59.527 --> 01:03:05.914]  And so the Trump administration, and also me as an investigative reporter, have been going after these so-called placeholder cases.
[01:03:06.294 --> 01:03:08.616]  Jeffrey Epstein was one of those placeholder cases.
[01:03:08.656 --> 01:03:11.659]  However, they killed Jeffrey Epstein, where he committed suicide.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:18.006]  And so, you know, he's not going to then turn on the people like Jelaine Maxwell, who he was involved with.
[01:03:18.826 --> 01:03:24.589]  It's interesting to note that Keith Raniere of Nexium, his sentencing is now delayed until 2020.
[01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:27.311]  That gives him a lot more time to talk.
[01:03:27.631 --> 01:03:33.734]  And so my appeal to the prison guards who are guarding Keith Raniere right now is, please don't pull an Epstein.
[01:03:34.054 --> 01:03:35.035]  Keep this man safe.
[01:03:35.663 --> 01:03:56.974]  Okay, not for his sake, but for our sake, because this guy was being funded by the Bronfmans, the cult was illegally bundling money for Hillary Clinton, Kirsten Gillibrand's family was in the child trafficking cult, they were running human experiment daycares in Guatemala and Mexico, grooming little kids, giving them thick visas to get them up over the border, and
[01:03:58.235 --> 01:04:03.940]  Claire Bronfman's brother even owned the land where the child sex bunker was found in New Mexico.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:04.540]  Wow.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:17.190]  So, you can see the whole map of human trafficking as it comes up from Central America over the border, and then these kids get plumped into situations where they are the victims of satanic, pedophile human traffickers.
[01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:19.231]  That is the issue of our times.
[01:04:19.271 --> 01:04:21.373]  That's the power structure of our world right now.
[01:04:21.793 --> 01:04:26.537]  And they can't kill every Jeffrey Epstein because all this truth is cascading out into the open.
[01:04:27.099 --> 01:04:28.219]  I think you're exactly right.
[01:04:28.259 --> 01:04:30.240]  We are winning this thing whether they like it or not.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.581]  Patrick, we've got to take a short commercial break here in about 30 seconds.
[01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:41.864]  When we get back, I want to pick your brain about why is it that they're always going after, I mean, we had NXIVM going after almost exclusively Hispanic children.
[01:04:41.884 --> 01:04:44.104]  We had Epstein who went after a certain subset.
[01:04:44.124 --> 01:04:46.485]  We have Ed Buck who goes after young black men.
[01:04:46.845 --> 01:04:49.786]  It almost, it's very bizarre and very interrelated.
[01:04:49.866 --> 01:04:51.607]  As you said, it is absolutely a network.
[01:04:51.987 --> 01:04:54.167]  I'm Tom Paffert filling in for Alex Jones today.
[01:04:54.207 --> 01:04:56.128]  He will be back in studio, hopefully.
[01:04:56.468 --> 01:04:59.150]  Later this afternoon, but you are watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:59.170 --> 01:05:02.533]  We'll be back with Patrick Howley after this short break.
[01:05:05.756 --> 01:05:09.659]  InfoWars presents Real Stable Genius.
[01:05:09.759 --> 01:05:12.381]  Real Stable Genius.
[01:05:12.401 --> 01:05:16.344]  Today we salute you, Mr. Fake News Anchorman.
[01:05:16.384 --> 01:05:18.686]  Mr. Fake News Anchorman.
[01:05:18.906 --> 01:05:25.512]  Night after night, you robotically read off a teleprompter, words written by someone else.
[01:05:26.392 --> 01:05:32.415]  When it comes out what you reported was fake, you feel no guilt.
[01:05:32.715 --> 01:05:35.876]  After all, you were just doing your job.
[01:05:37.597 --> 01:05:44.740]  Less and less tune in every night, but that won't hurt your ego because you're on television.
[01:05:46.209 --> 01:05:48.851]  So crack open an ice-cold Cuck Light.
[01:05:49.171 --> 01:05:51.592]  Mr. Fake News Anchorman.
[01:05:51.692 --> 01:05:57.755]  Because despite the fancy suit and big salary, we know you're just a puppet.
[01:05:57.776 --> 01:05:59.797]  What the hell did I just read?
[01:05:59.877 --> 01:06:00.577]  Cuck Light.
[01:06:00.737 --> 01:06:02.178]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:02.518 --> 01:06:03.559]  Austin, Texas.
[01:06:15.012 --> 01:06:21.314]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.716 --> 01:06:28.057]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:28.177 --> 01:06:30.398]  I am Tom Pappert filling in for Alex today.
[01:06:30.438 --> 01:06:35.040]  It's an honor to be here with my very, very important guest, Patrick Howley.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:43.523]  He's at Howley Reporter on Twitter, and he is by and large the most devastatingly effective journalist when it comes to breaking apart
[01:06:43.903 --> 01:06:47.484]  These sex rings, sex cults, alleged drug dens.
[01:06:47.764 --> 01:06:51.286]  So, Patrick, we were talking a little bit in the last few seconds of the last segment.
[01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:55.667]  They always seem to go after very specific subsets of the population.
[01:06:55.707 --> 01:07:03.470]  And this is from one of the alleged victims of Ed Buck, who made it out, who fled the apartment and never returned.
[01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:07.271]  This was a homeless young black man who had been on the street.
[01:07:07.331 --> 01:07:12.433]  He was allegedly paid $200 by Buck to spend the night with him.
[01:07:13.093 --> 01:07:16.636]  And this is one of the quotes that he gave the media.
[01:07:16.676 --> 01:07:20.679]  He said, I'm his type, and pretty much half the black community is his type.
[01:07:21.159 --> 01:07:21.740]  Vulnerable.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:22.520]  Depressed.
[01:07:23.061 --> 01:07:27.945]  If you're in a depressive state, that's the energy that feeds him.
[01:07:28.025 --> 01:07:29.906]  That's the energy that feeds him.
[01:07:29.946 --> 01:07:35.791]  I think that is the most startling and shocking line I've read this year.
[01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:41.517]  Talk a little bit, if you could, about how these people, do you agree they feed off energy?
[01:07:41.577 --> 01:07:46.983]  That's what we had with Epstein, that's what we had with NXIVM, and now that's what we allegedly have with Ed Buck.
[01:07:47.003 --> 01:07:47.624]  Do you agree with that?
[01:07:48.962 --> 01:07:54.627]  Yes, they feed off of misery, they feed off of adrenaline, but they feed off of negative energy.
[01:07:54.827 --> 01:07:59.491]  And if you are somebody who is a marginalized person, then you are at risk.
[01:07:59.551 --> 01:08:01.133]  Look at Child Protective Services.
[01:08:01.213 --> 01:08:15.005]  It was Hillary Clinton, through her husband, signing the Adoption and Safe Families Act in 1997 that created financial incentives to take kids out of their homes, put them in foster care, and now the State Department confirms that they're being child sex trafficked.
[01:08:15.385 --> 01:08:17.087]  And so that happened because of the Clintons.
[01:08:17.107 --> 01:08:23.291]  There is now an entire industry all over the country of kids who are being sex trafficked through child protective services.
[01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:24.813]  The Clintons put that in place.
[01:08:25.093 --> 01:08:29.736]  The Clintons have been at the center of human trafficking for the last 20 or 30 years.
[01:08:30.197 --> 01:08:35.181]  And we are seeing everybody who's connected with them now during the Trump years, you know, being a target.
[01:08:35.481 --> 01:08:37.963]  Church of Scientology is being sued for human trafficking.
[01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:41.344]  Church of Scientology has a very powerful lobbying shop in D.C.
[01:08:41.644 --> 01:08:42.885]  They're lobbyist Greg Mitchell.
[01:08:42.905 --> 01:08:45.345]  You can find photos of him with Hillary Clinton.
[01:08:45.365 --> 01:08:48.686]  You can go to the L. Ron Hubbard House in DuPont Circle, as I've been.
[01:08:48.746 --> 01:08:51.287]  I took a VIP tour during the election.
[01:08:51.607 --> 01:08:58.750]  And you can see very clearly that this occult, elitist network is operating all over the country and all over the world.
[01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:00.650]  And they're not messing around.
[01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:02.911]  And so this really is a war for humanity.
[01:09:03.882 --> 01:09:10.904]  Patrick, you've been covering something, and this is very related, that I honestly do not know if this has been important.
[01:09:11.184 --> 01:09:17.246]  This is very important information, the CPS scandals that you have been single-handedly breaking at Epoch Times and National File.
[01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:19.327]  Very, very important stuff.
[01:09:19.347 --> 01:09:21.167]  Can you tell us a little bit about this?
[01:09:21.207 --> 01:09:30.770]  Because some people don't understand that CPS, these are not necessarily great families that the government is ripping children out of their birth parents and giving them to.
[01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:33.591]  So explain to us the work you've been doing here lately.
[01:09:35.074 --> 01:09:39.796]  I broke the story of massive child prostitution that's going on in the California CPS.
[01:09:39.816 --> 01:09:42.697]  That's not exclusive to California, it's happening all over the country.
[01:09:43.217 --> 01:09:47.999]  The state of California doesn't even put out an Amber Alert if kids go missing from foster care.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:52.681]  All of the kids are officially labeled as runaways, so that no Amber Alert has to go out.
[01:09:52.942 --> 01:09:56.123]  And the reason is that they leave for a short period of time,
[01:09:56.463 --> 01:10:03.609]  And they engage in prostitution, and they get 20 johns at a time, and they get paid, and their pimps get paid, and then they get returned to foster care.
[01:10:03.869 --> 01:10:05.290]  And this is what they do on the weekends.
[01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:06.872]  This is what they do for days at a time.
[01:10:07.212 --> 01:10:08.573]  This is happening all over the country.
[01:10:08.593 --> 01:10:21.104]  The Clintons created this system in 1997 by signing an act that pays foster parents, that allows everybody in the CPS system to get paid if they take the kids out of the parents' houses.
[01:10:21.444 --> 01:10:24.947]  I'm coming out with an article today that's a real bombshell, showing how in Oregon,
[01:10:26.207 --> 01:10:31.608]  Parents who are conservatives, Christians, and Trump supporters are being targeted with fake CPS reports.
[01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.209]  Antifa is doing this.
[01:10:33.289 --> 01:10:47.672]  Antifa is making fake CPS reports against Trump-supporting parents and weaponizing this agency, knowing that every single time CPS goes into a parent's house, they have a financial incentive to take the kids away, and they're going to look for any excuse to do it.
[01:10:48.834 --> 01:10:51.818]  That is horrifying information, but it doesn't really surprise us.
[01:10:51.858 --> 01:10:53.160]  So let's just recap here.
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:11:02.351]  We have people like Ed Buck, who are giving money to Hillary Clinton, allegedly drugging and allegedly killing young black men.
[01:11:02.371 --> 01:11:04.454]  We have people like Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:11:04.734 --> 01:11:08.057]  Close personal friend of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton.
[01:11:08.077 --> 01:11:10.620]  I mean, we know how many times he flew on the Lolita Express.
[01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:14.203]  We think that he's been to the infamous pedophile island.
[01:11:14.424 --> 01:11:23.112]  We have NXIVM, which gave money to the Clintons, and now we have the Clintons essentially building a system that allows children to be prostituted.
[01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:28.057]  Patrick, what can be done to right this ship with CPS?
[01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:28.958]  What can be done here?
[01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:34.251]  Well, look, the Clintons are the mafia bosses.
[01:11:34.371 --> 01:11:36.053]  However, they're not the top bosses.
[01:11:36.113 --> 01:11:48.130]  I mean, if you look at the networks here and you realize that Jelaine Maxwell, who is Jeffrey Epstein's handler, her father was business partners with Charles Bronfman of the Bronfman family of NXIVM fame, Jeffrey Epstein himself.
[01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:48.770]  We're good.
[01:12:04.339 --> 01:12:06.260]  And they thought they were untouchable for a long time.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:14.582]  That's why NXIVM was hiding in plain sight until a whistleblower named Frank Perlato came to Maine and we started busting this thing up and exposing the connections.
[01:12:14.882 --> 01:12:17.863]  And what they're doing very clearly is they're doing satanic rituals.
[01:12:18.223 --> 01:12:24.845]  They're bringing in kids in as sex slaves and they're performing satanic rituals and they're using them for horrible, horrible things.
[01:12:25.125 --> 01:12:26.126]  But it's not just sex.
[01:12:26.186 --> 01:12:28.266]  It's not just for their own sexual gratification.
[01:12:28.546 --> 01:12:30.087]  It's also for occult rituals.
[01:12:30.447 --> 01:12:30.627]  Thank you.
[01:13:00.647 --> 01:13:01.708]  These people are clowns.
[01:13:01.868 --> 01:13:03.529]  They're all connected to intelligence.
[01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:06.851]  And so it becomes harder to go after them.
[01:13:07.111 --> 01:13:09.413]  But we have to keep going after these placeholder cases.
[01:13:09.453 --> 01:13:15.436]  And so yet again, my appeal to Keith Raniere as prison guard says, keep that guy safe.
[01:13:15.937 --> 01:13:16.697]  Do your job.
[01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:17.938]  Don't take a bribe.
[01:13:18.278 --> 01:13:21.480]  Don't, you know, leave the gate open and look the other way.
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:25.923]  Because this guy very well could flip and make a deal and that would change human history.
[01:13:26.752 --> 01:13:30.294]  I think you're absolutely right about that, and a lot of us were hoping that that would happen with Epstein.
[01:13:30.314 --> 01:13:31.235]  Of course, it didn't happen.
[01:13:31.275 --> 01:13:39.620]  Now, in the next segment, I want to get into what is being done by the Trump administration, which there are some faults with the Trump administration, but going after child sex trafficking is not one of them.
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:51.908]  But for the couple minutes we have left, I want to just get your thoughts on how high up Ed Buck is, and is there a potential for an Epstein-Raniere type of situation with Ed Buck?
[01:13:53.453 --> 01:13:54.233]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:13:54.333 --> 01:13:58.674]  Ed Buck has been one of the biggest institutional Democrat donors for a long time.
[01:13:58.714 --> 01:14:00.135]  He's at a Tom Steyer level.
[01:14:00.835 --> 01:14:03.696]  And, you know, it's interesting to look into Tom Steyer.
[01:14:03.716 --> 01:14:06.437]  What was he talking about in some of those Podesta emails?
[01:14:06.477 --> 01:14:07.837]  He showed up in Podesta emails.
[01:14:07.857 --> 01:14:08.297]  That's right.
[01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:10.218]  These people are all linked to one another.
[01:14:10.318 --> 01:14:15.599]  And so the thing is, if any one of them goes down or becomes compromised or decides to flip,
[01:14:16.374 --> 01:14:18.134]  Then the whole thing comes down.
[01:14:18.494 --> 01:14:27.836]  And that's why you see so many of these people dying like Jeffrey Epstein, because there is a system of accountability where if they think someone's going to flip, then that person ends up dead.
[01:14:28.217 --> 01:14:30.117]  And this often happens in Clinton world.
[01:14:30.717 --> 01:14:32.317]  And there are stories you never even hear about.
[01:14:32.357 --> 01:14:33.538]  There's Harold H.L.
[01:14:33.598 --> 01:14:39.299]  Moody, who is a program coordinator at Pulaski County Youth Services in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[01:14:39.759 --> 01:14:46.681]  He was also the communications director for the Arkansas Democrat Party during the 2016 election, a close friend of Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:46.921 --> 01:14:47.821]  And he was arrested.
[01:14:47.861 --> 01:14:52.143]  He was in a child porn chat room and he was showing baby rape videos.
[01:14:52.623 --> 01:14:57.984]  And he even said to his fellow people in this chat room, I've heard of white privilege, but not perv privilege.
[01:14:58.344 --> 01:15:00.285]  I'm not the jukebox at Waffle House.
[01:15:00.365 --> 01:15:01.665]  I don't play on demand.
[01:15:02.005 --> 01:15:02.906]  This guy was arrested.
[01:15:02.946 --> 01:15:04.606]  It was completely blacked out in the press.
[01:15:04.646 --> 01:15:05.627]  Nobody's heard about this.
[01:15:05.967 --> 01:15:06.707]  Harold H.L.
[01:15:06.747 --> 01:15:07.007]  Moody.
[01:15:08.107 --> 01:15:13.630]  The Clintons even put their health initiative through the Clinton Foundation in Pulaski County.
[01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:20.113]  They gave an award to the head of Pulaski County Youth Services where this man was employed, where he was smoking meth at his desk.
[01:15:20.553 --> 01:15:24.795]  And there was another case where a guy who worked there was arrested for raping a 14-year-old boy.
[01:15:25.215 --> 01:15:27.156]  This is a human trafficking operation.
[01:15:27.516 --> 01:15:29.137]  I'm not scared about getting killed.
[01:15:29.457 --> 01:15:31.098]  If they kill me, I'll go meet my maker.
[01:15:31.358 --> 01:15:35.560]  I'm going to use every moment that I have in order to get as much information about this out there to the people.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.801]  Well, and Patrick, we're friends.
[01:15:36.861 --> 01:15:39.103]  I know for a fact that you are in a good state of mind.
[01:15:39.143 --> 01:15:42.785]  You're a happy, healthy individual, and if anything were to happen, it would be suspicious.
[01:15:42.806 --> 01:15:51.852]  When we come back, we're going to talk about exactly what the Trump administration is doing, because by and large, they're going after these people more than we've seen ever before.
[01:15:51.892 --> 01:15:54.855]  That's one of the many great things about the Trump administration.
[01:15:55.115 --> 01:15:56.616]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:56.776 --> 01:15:57.617]  I'm Tom Papert.
[01:15:57.877 --> 01:16:00.159]  We'll be back after this break.
[01:16:09.377 --> 01:16:14.178]  If you want to continue to see us on air, I gotta tell you, it's so simple.
[01:16:14.238 --> 01:16:15.339]  Shop with the good guys.
[01:16:15.519 --> 01:16:18.040]  Go to Infowarsstore.com, especially if you never have.
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:23.201]  Get some of the great nootropics we've got that are healthy, good stimulants like RainForce, ParaboForce, and then ChillForce.
[01:16:23.321 --> 01:16:26.762]  It gives you that awake, but focused, zen-type, awake, chill feeling.
[01:16:26.862 --> 01:16:32.124]  And you can find that combo at Infowarsstore.com for 50% off with the two together.
[01:16:32.224 --> 01:16:34.545]  And Barnes, I never asked you to do this, but you were chiming in.
[01:16:34.585 --> 01:16:38.426]  You really like our Wake Up America coffee, and you were saying you really like BrainForce.
[01:16:38.706 --> 01:16:41.169]  Oh yeah, so I mean, I've always got the coffee, which is great.
[01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.930]  It's fantastic.
[01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:43.311]  Some of the best coffee I've ever had.
[01:16:43.452 --> 01:16:44.433]  That's the reason why I get them.
[01:16:44.473 --> 01:16:45.494]  Bit of a coffee snob.
[01:16:45.594 --> 01:16:48.237]  I've always got the fluoride-free toothpaste, because I like that.
[01:16:48.377 --> 01:16:55.365]  Because I've always had concerns about fluoride, which were recently confirmed in a wide range of studies, after they were criticizing it for forever and saying there's no worries, no concerns.
[01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:57.608]  All of a sudden, they're like, well, it actually causes baby defects.
[01:16:57.768 --> 01:17:01.654]  And then I like the protein bars because they're a good sort of intermediate snack.
[01:17:01.734 --> 01:17:09.645]  So when you want something to eat between sort of lunch and dinner or between dinner and a late snack, you don't want it just to be, you know, Little Debbie's or Swiss cake rolls, then protein bars really hit the spot.
[01:17:09.705 --> 01:17:14.232]  But so with the protein bars, I got a free sample of Brain Force and typically I'm not a supplement guy.
[01:17:14.392 --> 01:17:19.736]  Unlike other people, my brain chemistry is such that it's unaffected by most medicines, unaffected by a wide range of things.
[01:17:19.856 --> 01:17:21.197]  So I just generally haven't tried it.
[01:17:21.277 --> 01:17:24.059]  So I got a free sample and I was like, well, what the heck, I'll try it, see if it works.
[01:17:24.179 --> 01:17:28.342]  Because of the nature of my legal work, I have these peak times where I need peak mental activity.
[01:17:28.642 --> 01:17:33.485]  Whether it's doing a trial, whether it's about to be in front of a court hearing, whether it's doing an appellate oral argument.
[01:17:33.505 --> 01:17:35.027]  There are times when you're up for two days.
[01:17:35.227 --> 01:17:35.707]  Oh, exactly.
[01:17:35.747 --> 01:17:40.250]  So I need to be able to, during that time period of when I'm, you know, I used to be able to stay up two days no problem.
[01:17:40.330 --> 01:17:41.291]  You know, didn't blink twice.
[01:17:41.451 --> 01:17:43.953]  No, passing that age threshold, that's not so easy.
[01:17:44.013 --> 01:17:47.675]  So I needed something that when I wake up, I could stay peak and keep at that peak level.
[01:17:47.775 --> 01:17:49.056]  And so I figured, I'll go ahead and try it.
[01:17:49.116 --> 01:17:50.237]  And it turned out to be fantastic.
[01:17:50.417 --> 01:17:52.438]  It's the best product I've ever had in that regard.
[01:17:52.538 --> 01:17:56.081]  In fact, what happened was I had taken it earlier in the day, and it was like around 9 or 10 p.m.
[01:17:56.101 --> 01:17:58.703]  I was like, why am I still at sort of peak mental facility?
[01:17:58.763 --> 01:18:00.204]  Because I've been going for 15 hours.
[01:18:00.344 --> 01:18:02.825]  And usually by that point, I started to fatigue, started to drift off.
[01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:06.348]  In fact, I was trying to watch entertainment, my brain was still going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:09.650]  And then I realized, oh, this was the very first time I'd taken BrainForce.
[01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:10.830]  So I was like, this must be it.
[01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:15.433]  So I went and researched all the ingredients, figured out, oh, OK, this makes perfect sense, this combination.
[01:18:15.713 --> 01:18:19.154]  And for whatever reason, no one else out in the marketplace has really combined it in the way you have.
[01:18:19.454 --> 01:18:21.315]  Well, what I did is I went to top developers.
[01:18:21.335 --> 01:18:22.976]  I had to pay people quite a bit of money for that.
[01:18:23.016 --> 01:18:24.957]  I mean, just our turbo force, I had to pay.
[01:18:26.338 --> 01:18:29.141]  $30,000 from the guy, top developer of products.
[01:18:29.241 --> 01:18:33.366]  We said if somebody would put a lot of money into something, because the other manufacturers won't, what would your dream product be?
[01:18:33.386 --> 01:18:37.089]  And I had to pay the guy, he's famous, I can't say his name, that's in the contract, to make TurboForce.
[01:18:37.210 --> 01:18:39.772]  The best, the strongest, 10-hour energy is really what it is.
[01:18:39.812 --> 01:18:43.236]  And really what they did was, they spliced two best-selling products together.
[01:18:43.916 --> 01:18:45.377]  And so that's why it works so well.
[01:18:45.397 --> 01:18:46.217]  Oh, it's fantastic.
[01:18:46.437 --> 01:18:47.617]  And what's great is the whole model.
[01:18:47.637 --> 01:18:52.599]  The whole model of trying to make it affordable so the large blue-collar part of the audience can also afford it.
[01:18:52.619 --> 01:19:07.524]  It basically, it's a way for people to be healthier, for people to be wealthier because they're getting the same products they would otherwise buy but cheaper, and to be able to change the world at the same time by creating a network that can literally help elect the President of the United States the most powerful country in the world.
[01:19:07.904 --> 01:19:09.905]  Folks, we're in a total war right now.
[01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:16.188]  I mean, we've really gone up and punched the dragon in the nose, and now the real fight's on.
[01:19:16.248 --> 01:19:20.211]  We're doing everything we can here, but it takes products being sold.
[01:19:20.311 --> 01:19:21.912]  That's how we fund our operation.
[01:19:21.932 --> 01:19:23.413]  We've got Ultimate Bone Broth.
[01:19:23.473 --> 01:19:27.095]  It is the strongest, best bone broth from chicken bone broth.
[01:19:27.455 --> 01:19:28.636]  It's super high quality.
[01:19:28.676 --> 01:19:29.497]  It's the best out there.
[01:19:29.577 --> 01:19:30.458]  The best fish oil.
[01:19:30.498 --> 01:19:31.279]  The best turmeric.
[01:19:31.339 --> 01:19:32.601]  The best skin cream.
[01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:34.663]  A lot of really game-changing stuff.
[01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:37.826]  So thanks for the plug, but just sign up for AutoShip on things you're gonna want to reorder.
[01:19:37.966 --> 01:19:41.630]  And then even if something's selling out, we hold back another order of that so you get it.
[01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:44.033]  I've invested over a hundred million dollars.
[01:19:44.193 --> 01:19:47.116]  You have, in the last 15 years in this place, or more.
[01:19:47.457 --> 01:19:48.278]  Alex, way more than that.
[01:19:49.096 --> 01:19:49.576]  You understand?
[01:19:50.336 --> 01:19:52.137]  So, you want this to keep living?
[01:19:52.737 --> 01:19:54.058]  Hey, feed me Seymour!
[01:19:54.518 --> 01:19:55.638]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:55.878 --> 01:19:56.918]  I appreciate all of your support.
[01:19:56.938 --> 01:20:02.380]  I got some big specials right now.
[01:20:04.921 --> 01:20:10.843]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.887 --> 01:20:30.229]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:30.249 --> 01:20:31.430]  I'm filling in for Alex today.
[01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:35.634]  He just did a very important podcast with a very high-profile person.
[01:20:35.674 --> 01:20:37.555]  I'm looking forward to seeing that drop.
[01:20:37.856 --> 01:20:40.158]  We have Patrick Halley with us via Skype.
[01:20:40.198 --> 01:20:46.143]  He's going to tell us what the Trump administration is doing to fight back against these child trafficking cults.
[01:20:46.623 --> 01:20:48.785]  But first, we do have to take a moment here.
[01:20:48.805 --> 01:20:51.087]  I'm just being completely honest, folks.
[01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:55.491]  I am a big supporter of InfoWarsTore.com and it is very rare
[01:20:55.971 --> 01:21:02.402]  That you can get up to 75% off on dozens of products at Infowarestore.com.
[01:21:02.442 --> 01:21:08.652]  And this deal, again, I have no idea how Alex makes these things happen, but I'm guessing this is going to end very soon.
[01:21:09.975 --> 01:21:12.096]  Alex and I have had these conversations.
[01:21:12.257 --> 01:21:23.904]  He is trying to expand as rapidly as humanly possible, and this is in the face of such insane censorship that it has... nothing like this has ever been seen before.
[01:21:23.924 --> 01:21:27.486]  There has never been censorship like what has happened to Alex Jones.
[01:21:27.546 --> 01:21:29.948]  I mean, on Facebook you're not allowed to say the man's name.
[01:21:29.988 --> 01:21:32.910]  In fact, for a couple hours, about a month ago,
[01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:37.013]  Facebook would actually let you plot Alex Jones' death.
[01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:39.174]  You could assassinate Alex Jones on Facebook.
[01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:41.516]  Facebook was saying you could break the law, essentially.
[01:21:41.556 --> 01:21:42.777]  They changed it back, though.
[01:21:43.397 --> 01:21:43.818]  It's okay.
[01:21:43.878 --> 01:21:48.721]  But 75% off the new Total Gut Health Combo Pack with 7 powerful formulas.
[01:21:49.742 --> 01:21:49.922]  75% off.
[01:21:50.222 --> 01:21:56.327]  There's 50% off Super Male Vitality and you get a free bottle of Ultimate Female Force.
[01:21:56.347 --> 01:22:00.210]  63% off the best-selling MycoZX Plus Fungus and Yeast Support.
[01:22:00.230 --> 01:22:01.111]  50% off Ultra 12, Vitamin B12.
[01:22:04.233 --> 01:22:06.754]  60% off the Super Blue Immune Gargle.
[01:22:07.054 --> 01:22:09.776]  If you travel, I cannot stress this stuff enough.
[01:22:09.956 --> 01:22:10.816]  Silver works.
[01:22:10.896 --> 01:22:13.918]  Silver is one of the best things you can do for immune support.
[01:22:13.938 --> 01:22:15.579]  50% off bodies.
[01:22:15.819 --> 01:22:16.980]  Many, many other.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:23.743]  This is your opportunity to stock up while the deals are this deep at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:22:23.863 --> 01:22:27.806]  I cannot suggest it enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:28.086 --> 01:22:28.326]  Okay.
[01:22:28.766 --> 01:22:31.668]  So we have Patrick Howley here with us via Skype.
[01:22:32.008 --> 01:22:35.771]  Patrick is a reporter for NationalFile.com as well as the Epoch Times.
[01:22:35.831 --> 01:22:37.332]  And again, congratulations, Patrick.
[01:22:37.372 --> 01:22:40.775]  That is a fantastic place for these stories to be disseminated.
[01:22:41.275 --> 01:22:50.822]  Patrick, you are a big proponent of President Trump because, by and large, he is one of the few people who is fighting back against this Clinton-aligned
[01:22:51.722 --> 01:22:54.087]  Mess of cults and everything else.
[01:22:54.127 --> 01:22:56.671]  So Patrick, tell us, what is the Trump administration doing?
[01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:58.014]  Are they doing enough?
[01:22:58.254 --> 01:23:00.117]  And what are they doing to fight back against this?
[01:23:01.775 --> 01:23:07.738]  Trump's been fighting this for years, and it remains to be seen whether they're doing enough, because we're going to have to see the results.
[01:23:07.778 --> 01:23:09.639]  That's all that really matters in human history.
[01:23:09.999 --> 01:23:14.762]  I will tell you that on October 1st, the Family First Act goes into effect.
[01:23:14.862 --> 01:23:21.606]  President Donald Trump last year quietly slipped this in as an addition on the bottom of a short-term spending bill.
[01:23:21.966 --> 01:23:31.091]  Knowing that Congress had to pass a short-term spending bill, Trump secretly put something into that bill called the Family First Act, which passed into law without anyone knowing.
[01:23:31.491 --> 01:23:40.200]  And what it does is it de-incentivizes taking kids out of their houses and putting them into foster care and then adopting them.
[01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:45.285]  I heard from a man yesterday in Oklahoma who said that he had just lost his kids.
[01:23:45.605 --> 01:23:46.626]  He was a cook at Chili's.
[01:23:46.687 --> 01:23:47.988]  He had a heart episode at work.
[01:23:48.408 --> 01:23:55.691]  They didn't file an official report to say what happened, that he had a heart episode, because the manager was an illegal alien and didn't want an official report.
[01:23:55.991 --> 01:23:57.812]  That put him into the CPS system.
[01:23:58.312 --> 01:24:00.753]  And after 15 months, there was no choice.
[01:24:00.933 --> 01:24:01.993]  The kids get adopted out.
[01:24:02.053 --> 01:24:03.014]  So his family's gone.
[01:24:03.054 --> 01:24:04.954]  He said, why am I even an American at this point?
[01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:06.155]  I don't have a family.
[01:24:06.215 --> 01:24:07.015]  I don't have a job.
[01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.636]  I don't have any constitutional rights.
[01:24:09.076 --> 01:24:16.222]  That's what's happened ever since these financial incentives were put in place in 1997 for child protective services to human traffic kids.
[01:24:16.522 --> 01:24:21.746]  So on October 1st, Trump on a state-by-state level is going to start taking some of those financial incentives away.
[01:24:22.247 --> 01:24:30.774]  On October 4th, the Trump administration is holding an emergency meeting on the same day that parents are rallying at the state capitol in Sacramento.
[01:24:31.134 --> 01:24:36.839]  And the Trump administration is going to discuss an emergency response to the child sex trafficking epidemic.
[01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:37.699]  We're good to go.
[01:24:53.969 --> 01:25:05.098]  I mean, Trump has been doing this for years, but his administration now is being forced to actually do something about it because of the constant public outcry and the reporting of all the facts that are coming out about what's really going on.
[01:25:05.478 --> 01:25:09.882]  This is human slavery, and there's no freedom in this country as long as this is going on.
[01:25:09.942 --> 01:25:22.692]  So let's not pretend like we still live in the country of, you know, of freedom and liberty and the Constitution still means anything if the government is coming by and taking kids out of your house and sex trafficking them.
[01:25:23.012 --> 01:25:24.253]  That's the worst thing that could happen.
[01:25:24.793 --> 01:25:41.543]  So Patrick, we've got a few minutes left here and I kind of want to thread some of this together because we know that the girls, the women, it's mostly children who come in from Central America, something like 86% of them are raped as they come into the United States illegally.
[01:25:41.983 --> 01:26:02.796]  We also know, thanks in no small part to your reporting, I cannot suggest high enough that people go follow at Halley Reporter on Twitter where he puts out his information first, but we now know, again thanks to you, that NXIVM was bringing in illegal immigrant teenage girls and telling them that they are essential slaves.
[01:26:03.197 --> 01:26:04.737]  They have no freedom.
[01:26:05.778 --> 01:26:17.342]  How does stopping illegal immigration, and President Trump is building the wall with all of the roadblocks that he's encountered, it is still going up, he is still working, I mean he's forced Mexico to stop some of these crossings.
[01:26:17.703 --> 01:26:21.324]  How does this tie together illegal immigration and human trafficking?
[01:26:22.819 --> 01:26:29.601]  The media's outcry over separating children from their parents at the border is all predicated on a diversion.
[01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:32.382]  Everything they try to do, they hide it in plain sight.
[01:26:32.622 --> 01:26:39.564]  The Democrats were colluding with Russia on Uranium One, and so they created a public spectacle about Trump being allied with Russia.
[01:26:39.964 --> 01:26:46.531]  What's going on is that they're trafficking these kids up using human traffickers and most of the parents are not actually related to the kids.
[01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:55.861]  So if they create as much of a spectacle in the media and as much outrage about supposedly separating these kids from their parents, they can conceal the fact that they're not actually the parents.
[01:26:56.281 --> 01:27:10.952]  When Trump put in this DNA testing at the border to give the people a cheek swab and do rapid DNA testing at the border, they found immediately 30% of the parents who were taking the kids over the border were not actually the parents, they were frauds.
[01:27:11.293 --> 01:27:15.516]  Some of them even turned around before the DNA test and admitted to this and went back to Guatemala.
[01:27:16.056 --> 01:27:20.539]  So, the ACLU and CNN are now fighting the DNA testing.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:21.680]  Well, why?
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:27.264]  I mean, wouldn't you want to know if these are real parents who are related to the kids?
[01:27:27.705 --> 01:27:28.445]  It's all a joke.
[01:27:28.525 --> 01:27:30.627]  They're on the side of human trafficking.
[01:27:30.947 --> 01:27:43.056]  They don't want it to be exposed that these are human traffickers, and so they're trying to hide this barbaric practice in plain sight by diverting and making people think that the Trump administration has some kind of fascist policy at the border.
[01:27:44.022 --> 01:27:46.464]  Patrick, you are absolutely on fire, my friend.
[01:27:46.524 --> 01:27:47.584]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[01:27:47.805 --> 01:27:49.305]  We've got about a minute left here.
[01:27:49.346 --> 01:27:53.848]  Would you please tell us, again, I know it's at Halley Reporter, maybe tell us how to spell your name.
[01:27:53.889 --> 01:27:57.391]  Tell us where people can watch you, where people can find you, where people can find your work.
[01:27:59.326 --> 01:28:15.388]  At Howley Reporter, H-O-W-L-E-Y, Howley Reporter, and please go there, and you know, I'm going to have another big article for the Epoch Times later today about the political targeting, about how there are fake CPS reports being filed because the left wing knows that they can use
[01:28:16.128 --> 01:28:20.770]  This fraudulent agency, CPS, to weaponize against Trump supporters.
[01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:22.370]  And so that's what we're dealing with.
[01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.951]  Every Trump supporter is on the front lines.
[01:28:24.371 --> 01:28:28.392]  We've got to stick together and we've got to stay vigilant going into this election.
[01:28:28.612 --> 01:28:38.295]  And I think that President Donald Trump probably will win so long as we don't have some kind of big event put forth by the globalists before Election Day.
[01:28:38.995 --> 01:28:39.996]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:28:40.056 --> 01:28:42.138]  Thank you so much for coming on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:42.698 --> 01:28:45.280]  That was again Patrick Howley at Howley Reporter.
[01:28:45.540 --> 01:28:46.961]  I hope he comes back real soon.
[01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:48.282]  I'm Tom Pappert.
[01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.563]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.285]  Alex should be back.
[01:28:51.325 --> 01:28:54.427]  We'll find out if he's up to coming in studio in the next half hour.
[01:28:54.968 --> 01:28:57.650]  Thank you all so much for watching this very important broadcast.
[01:28:57.710 --> 01:29:00.772]  We will be back after this break.
[01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:14.828]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Troyer.
[01:29:15.369 --> 01:29:17.929]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:19.770]  What does it mean to not be a victim?
[01:29:20.670 --> 01:29:24.391]  It doesn't mean I like the hard times I've had in my life and some of the things that I've gone through.
[01:29:24.972 --> 01:29:29.193]  But those are things that I survived that made me stronger and informed me better.
[01:29:30.003 --> 01:29:32.725]  And so, what I am is somebody that is a builder.
[01:29:33.405 --> 01:29:35.286]  I'm someone that is a believer in humanity.
[01:29:35.347 --> 01:29:40.150]  I'm someone that has optimism because I've seen the amazing things our species can do.
[01:29:40.930 --> 01:29:42.751]  And I know we can do amazing things together.
[01:29:42.891 --> 01:29:44.072]  I've been on air 25 years.
[01:29:44.092 --> 01:29:44.833]  I started out on AXS TV.
[01:29:45.353 --> 01:29:55.515]  And I pulled myself up from my bootstraps by working with other people like you, who had the same vision, the same quest, to stand up against the America haters, the God haters, the unborn haters, the satanic globalists.
[01:29:55.715 --> 01:30:03.636]  And now we've been through so much together, that it's important to note, though, that we kind of get to the point where we're so confident, and we've gone through so much, we start thinking we're bulletproof.
[01:30:03.696 --> 01:30:07.617]  I mean, we go through trials, tribulations, and we still fight back and overcome.
[01:30:07.717 --> 01:30:10.657]  But I do need to tell you, we are at the greatest level of attack we've ever been.
[01:30:10.797 --> 01:30:14.058]  I mean, it gets to where we have huge hack attacks all the time, and threats, and
[01:30:14.338 --> 01:30:16.861]  Just crazy stuff I can't get into here on air for obvious reasons.
[01:30:17.241 --> 01:30:18.983]  And I just brush it off like it's no big deal.
[01:30:19.364 --> 01:30:23.148]  And I really understand that the fearlessness is part of why we're so successful.
[01:30:24.009 --> 01:30:28.674]  But I need to have a concern and a little bit of a fear of being too confident and failing.
[01:30:29.435 --> 01:30:31.778]  Because I'm not watching my six, and you're not watching your six.
[01:30:31.958 --> 01:30:35.522]  So listen, sit back for a few minutes and think about how far we've come together.
[01:30:35.582 --> 01:30:36.883]  Think what InfoWars has done.
[01:30:36.943 --> 01:30:38.204]  Think about how the world's changing.
[01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:42.509]  Think about how the globalists are fighting for their political lives right now instead of being arrogant and full control.
[01:30:42.609 --> 01:30:43.950]  I mean, we woke these bastards up.
[01:30:44.011 --> 01:30:44.952]  They thought they had us.
[01:30:45.152 --> 01:30:46.493]  But in truth, they already woke us up.
[01:30:46.533 --> 01:30:47.694]  So the contest is now.
[01:30:47.815 --> 01:30:48.575]  That's what I'm getting at.
[01:30:48.615 --> 01:30:51.899]  So when you spread the word about the site, the videos, the articles, when you buy the products,
[01:30:52.039 --> 01:30:53.520]  When you pray for us, it changes the world.
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:57.383]  My message is always the same because it's the truth, now more than ever.
[01:30:57.423 --> 01:30:59.564]  The Lunar 2020 stuff is crazy already.
[01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:12.653]  It's going to get crazier, so please commit to go to InfoWarsTore.com as your general store to get basics you need, like great coffee, like great turmeric, great fish oil, great nootropics, super high quality products, water filtration, air filtration, your replacement filters.
[01:31:12.673 --> 01:31:14.974]  Some of you bought filters 10 years ago, probably time to get some.
[01:31:15.094 --> 01:31:18.156]  InfoWarsTore.com, we're provisioning you, you're provisioning us.
[01:31:18.356 --> 01:31:18.737]  It is a 360 win.
[01:31:19.497 --> 01:31:19.957]  I think so.
[01:31:42.836 --> 01:31:43.857]  The war is now!
[01:31:44.177 --> 01:31:50.020]  The globalists are coming for your freedom, your children, your genetics, your treasure, your future, your destiny!
[01:31:50.261 --> 01:31:50.781]  Awaken!
[01:31:50.981 --> 01:31:51.842]  Get charged up!
[01:31:52.122 --> 01:31:52.902]  And resist!
[01:31:53.142 --> 01:31:54.243]  You are the future!
[01:31:54.483 --> 01:31:55.364]  You are the leaders!
[01:31:55.584 --> 01:31:57.225]  And you are unstoppable!
[01:33:05.091 --> 01:33:09.194]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:09.694 --> 01:33:11.035]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.103 --> 01:33:28.006]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:28.486 --> 01:33:30.828]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:34.290]  For my whole life,
[01:33:36.614 --> 01:33:39.176]  I didn't know if I even really existed.
[01:33:39.517 --> 01:33:40.617]  But I do.
[01:33:40.918 --> 01:33:43.220]  And people are starting to notice.
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:45.561]  You think this is funny?
[01:33:45.722 --> 01:33:47.003]  Is this a joke to you?
[01:34:05.683 --> 01:34:07.383]  Everybody, one small thing.
[01:34:07.463 --> 01:34:07.623]  Yeah?
[01:34:08.384 --> 01:34:12.564]  When you bring me out, can you introduce me as Joker?
[01:34:13.725 --> 01:34:27.368]  And the criminals are running the asylum, and they want to have a blood feast on us, like they had in Communist China, 60-plus million, and Soviet Russia, 50-plus million, and Hitler, 40-plus million, total dead, including 20 million Germans!
[01:34:27.868 --> 01:34:33.789]  If you want to be part of this blood feast, you're invited to dinner, but on the table, like a suckling hog!
[01:34:45.316 --> 01:34:46.157]  October 4th.
[01:34:47.057 --> 01:34:48.118]  Mark your calendars.
[01:34:48.298 --> 01:34:51.580]  That's the date we're all told by Hollywood and the corporate media.
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:53.081]  Breathlessly.
[01:34:54.241 --> 01:34:57.844]  That's Joaquin Phoenix's greatest role.
[01:34:58.304 --> 01:35:00.845]  It won in Venice in France.
[01:35:01.646 --> 01:35:02.306]  The Joker.
[01:35:03.387 --> 01:35:04.087]  It's coming out.
[01:35:04.988 --> 01:35:09.511]  And the critics that have seen it in the screenings, they say that the mere mortals
[01:35:10.589 --> 01:35:15.299]  I can't even understand the plot because it's so sophisticated.
[01:35:15.379 --> 01:35:16.421]  It's so incredible.
[01:35:16.882 --> 01:35:18.385]  Well, let me give you a spoiler alert.
[01:35:19.991 --> 01:35:21.872]  There's nothing sophisticated about the film.
[01:35:22.712 --> 01:35:28.795]  I've been given a full synopsis by contacts I have inside that vampire kingdom known as L.A.
[01:35:29.455 --> 01:35:31.916]  and it matches with the leaks and reviews I've seen.
[01:35:32.517 --> 01:35:41.201]  I'm about to tell you exactly what happens in the movie and why it's being put out now and what its real message is to the public.
[01:35:41.501 --> 01:35:43.022]  You know why they call him the Joker?
[01:35:44.062 --> 01:35:52.325]  Because it's a big joke to them that they're poisoning your water supply, and that your children are deformed and get cancer when they're 10 years old.
[01:35:52.725 --> 01:35:58.928]  Because it's a big joke to the New World Order, all the things they're doing to you, and how childlike you are.
[01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:03.291]  Modern psychology and psychiatry is a new priesthood.
[01:36:03.811 --> 01:36:05.893]  It's only been around 200 years or so.
[01:36:06.494 --> 01:36:17.624]  But from my research, Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell and others have the best take on psychology as a lens, a thought system to see the world through.
[01:36:17.984 --> 01:36:20.967]  But it doesn't mean it's God, doesn't mean it has all the answers.
[01:36:21.667 --> 01:36:34.373]  And Hollywood and the entire psychological system has admittedly been used for more than 70 years to shape the minds and attitudes of not just the people in America, but the people of the world.
[01:36:35.635 --> 01:36:37.717]  Carl Jung talked about archetypes.
[01:36:38.417 --> 01:36:39.918]  And the Joker is in the tarot deck.
[01:36:39.998 --> 01:36:42.800]  It's also in a deck of bicycle playing cards.
[01:36:43.241 --> 01:36:45.122]  Well, who is the Joker in archetype?
[01:36:45.803 --> 01:36:46.623]  He's a clown.
[01:36:46.683 --> 01:36:47.964]  He's a servant of the king.
[01:36:48.325 --> 01:36:52.928]  But he's allowed to speak his mind and entertain, but also play tricks.
[01:36:53.569 --> 01:37:00.214]  The exaggerated red lips and smiling teeth are not the smile of a friend.
[01:37:00.694 --> 01:37:02.635]  No, it's the smile of a great white shark.
[01:37:03.456 --> 01:37:05.457]  Coming out of the water and attacking its prey.
[01:37:05.937 --> 01:37:14.039]  It's the smile of a lion or a tiger when it pulls back its lips to bite into you or your wife or your child.
[01:37:15.479 --> 01:37:20.541]  It's the leering face of a pack of wild wolves chasing you through the woods.
[01:37:21.241 --> 01:37:25.862]  So at a primitive level, the Joker is a man-beast.
[01:37:26.342 --> 01:37:27.663]  He is possessed.
[01:37:28.786 --> 01:37:38.030]  He is filled with a demonic intelligence that only the wild can give him, because he's let himself go of any inhibition.
[01:37:39.731 --> 01:37:50.155]  The Joker is a human that has given himself over to the knowledge of evil, that has empowered himself to do things others will not do.
[01:37:51.488 --> 01:37:58.517]  At least that's what your run-of-the-mill devil worshipper or Luciferian or Aleister Crowleyite will tell you.
[01:37:59.018 --> 01:38:00.821]  The truth is the Joker is a loser.
[01:38:01.582 --> 01:38:07.189]  People that buy into the archetype end up destroying themselves and a bunch of other people usually along the way with them.
[01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:12.174]  But in the DC Universe, the last 70 years, he's Arthur Fleck.
[01:38:12.974 --> 01:38:18.239]  Now, the filmmakers tell you over and over again, this is not the Joker of comic books.
[01:38:18.579 --> 01:38:22.262]  Oh no, this is entirely new and something really deep and special.
[01:38:22.863 --> 01:38:35.053]  Well, the truth is, the original Joker is an archetype of a very evil, wicked person who only cares about themselves and wants to overthrow God's existing order and create a hell on earth that he controls.
[01:38:35.754 --> 01:38:48.105]  We saw that during the French Revolution, which was admittedly carried out by Luciferians who wanted to overthrow civilization and even the family and set up hell on earth with themselves in charge.
[01:38:49.046 --> 01:38:59.034]  Oh, and many of those pushing the French Revolution and other similar communist revolutions that came out of it, in many cases would dress up when they went out to commit murders like clowns.
[01:38:59.875 --> 01:39:05.439]  And that's really the true genius of the original comic book creators and people that made them popular like Stan Lee.
[01:39:05.859 --> 01:39:12.564]  They understood that they could take already existing characters that were real in the world and then take them and exaggerate them.
[01:39:13.064 --> 01:39:14.965]  Put them on paper and on the big screen.
[01:39:15.406 --> 01:39:22.931]  Just as Greek gods were simply a hyped up version of traits that the Greeks saw in people, Hollywood has done the same thing today.
[01:39:23.703 --> 01:39:26.106]  Now let's get into the new Joker film itself.
[01:39:26.887 --> 01:39:29.850]  This individual lives with his mommy in her basement.
[01:39:30.210 --> 01:39:36.917]  He has Tourette's Syndrome and laughs and makes weird noises at inopportune times and gets beat up.
[01:39:37.418 --> 01:39:38.399]  He's disempowered.
[01:39:38.759 --> 01:39:40.161]  His life is hellish.
[01:39:40.481 --> 01:39:42.323]  The critics tell him that he sucks.
[01:39:43.137 --> 01:39:49.081]  Well, isn't this Hollywood itself down 40% at the box office, collapsing, every other person's a comic?
[01:39:49.621 --> 01:39:51.702]  No one actually wants to work or raise a family.
[01:39:52.222 --> 01:40:08.292]  So this is that, again, archetype of the Communists, or of the Jacobins, of the French Revolution, that none of us are going to work, none of us are going to get jobs, and the only way we're going to ever be successful is if we overthrow the big corrupt system that is Gotham.
[01:40:08.912 --> 01:40:12.715]  And we go out and show them that we can be more evil than the system itself.
[01:40:12.755 --> 01:40:19.721]  That we can mastermind and engineer and organize all these other people to carry out crimes.
[01:40:20.361 --> 01:40:29.489]  But, like a sick, twisted Robin of Loxley or Robin Hood, they do it to people, in many cases, that actually deserve it.
[01:40:29.869 --> 01:40:33.472]  Because the stagnant system needs to be burned down and rebuilt.
[01:40:33.752 --> 01:40:35.534]  And who better to do it than the Joker?
[01:40:37.096 --> 01:40:58.334]  If you go back to the original days of the DC Universe, with the Joker in the 50s and 60s, we see someone who really enjoys poisoning the population, putting things into the water, the food, or cosmetics, or air, that only when you come into contact with both of them does it actually hurt or kill you.
[01:40:59.415 --> 01:41:00.335]  He's smiling.
[01:41:00.536 --> 01:41:01.536]  What is this?
[01:41:01.717 --> 01:41:03.798]  Love that Joker!
[01:41:03.938 --> 01:41:04.299]  Uh-oh!
[01:41:05.573 --> 01:41:06.634]  He don't look happy.
[01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:12.017]  He's been using Brand X. Joker Brand.
[01:41:13.058 --> 01:41:16.040]  I get a gram, a gil, and a gil.
[01:41:18.812 --> 01:41:24.198]  Now, I wonder where all those famous writers, the comic books, got an idea like that.
[01:41:24.738 --> 01:41:36.090]  Because back at the time, in the 40s and 50s, it was a big debate about how the Soviets and the Nazis put fluoride in the water to dumb people down, lower their fertility, and make them more easily manageable.
[01:41:36.710 --> 01:41:39.394]  And so that's why the joke is on you!
[01:41:39.414 --> 01:41:43.459]  And that's why it's gonna continue going on week after week.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.783]  Month after month, year after year, the joke's on you.
[01:41:46.803 --> 01:41:48.566]  What's scary?
[01:41:48.586 --> 01:41:50.508]  Somebody in some clown makeup?
[01:41:51.482 --> 01:41:52.923]  Because that can get your attention!
[01:41:52.983 --> 01:41:55.003]  That freaks you out at a primitive level!
[01:41:55.444 --> 01:41:57.304]  Nightmares out of your subconscious!
[01:41:57.764 --> 01:42:09.469]  But you're not afraid of some gentlemanly, middle-aged man who sits there talking with a sweet, calm voice, but tremulating with power and dark ghosts of death!
[01:42:10.506 --> 01:42:30.403]  When they write in Ecoscience, the National Science Czar's own government policy book, how they're poisoning your water supply, how they'll take all children at birth and raise them in government dormitories and do medical experiments on them, and how they'll bring in total charity and put implants in your body to control every facet.
[01:42:30.664 --> 01:42:31.605]  You know what's funny?
[01:42:32.552 --> 01:42:44.561]  Even though this book's free online at major university websites, you little bastards out there are gonna go watch your TV and your movies, and you're gonna sit there and laugh at me right now and not check any of it out.
[01:42:45.001 --> 01:42:50.085]  Hollywood would love for you to believe that this is some new angle they've come up with, but no, it's not.
[01:42:50.385 --> 01:42:52.166]  It's the angle they're obsessed with.
[01:42:52.406 --> 01:42:55.749]  It's why they can't come up with new ideas, because they don't want to.
[01:43:07.307 --> 01:43:08.532]  We got to fund this operation.
[01:43:09.697 --> 01:43:12.327]  I came in this morning and...
[01:43:15.247 --> 01:43:18.588]  He said, hey, everybody, what's a great Beto counter shirt?
[01:43:18.828 --> 01:43:19.969]  Like, from our cold, dead hands?
[01:43:20.609 --> 01:43:22.090]  I was like, well, how about from his cold, dead hands?
[01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:24.070]  Well, I don't want to threaten him, but that's what's going to happen.
[01:43:24.090 --> 01:43:25.591]  You know, they try to take the guns of civil war.
[01:43:25.611 --> 01:43:26.431]  I mean, how do you do it?
[01:43:26.631 --> 01:43:32.033]  He's got a shirt out he's selling saying, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s and all your other semi-autos.
[01:43:32.193 --> 01:43:37.735]  Well, one of my old friends, a guy that did security work for us, he called up this morning and said, we're in the middle of the show.
[01:43:37.875 --> 01:43:38.956]  He said, I just came up with this design.
[01:43:39.116 --> 01:43:40.877]  He said, how about Beto not?
[01:43:41.197 --> 01:43:41.797]  Beto not.
[01:43:42.197 --> 01:43:47.023]  It's a M4, AR-15, a Texas star above it, but it's an Army star, whatever you like.
[01:43:47.083 --> 01:43:48.244]  And then, Bateau Knot.
[01:43:48.264 --> 01:43:50.206]  These are being printed, already being printed.
[01:43:50.226 --> 01:43:51.828]  And on the back, oh, they already have it in Army Green.
[01:43:51.848 --> 01:43:52.529]  Go down there and click below.
[01:43:52.549 --> 01:43:53.390]  I guess they already did what I said.
[01:43:53.490 --> 01:43:55.753]  On the back, it says InfoWars.com.
[01:43:55.893 --> 01:43:56.854]  So, we've already got it.
[01:43:57.314 --> 01:43:58.075]  We've already got it in gray.
[01:43:58.095 --> 01:43:58.976]  We've already got it in army green.
[01:43:58.996 --> 01:44:00.177]  We've got it in darker gray.
[01:44:00.457 --> 01:44:02.039]  And this needs to be a best-seller.
[01:44:02.239 --> 01:44:05.402]  Exercise your First Amendment in defense of the second or lose it.
[01:44:05.562 --> 01:44:10.187]  And it's a win-win because you're funding this operation that, again, I just want to reach more people.
[01:44:10.527 --> 01:44:11.388]  That's your word of mouth.
[01:44:11.448 --> 01:44:12.609]  And I just want to fund the operation.
[01:44:12.649 --> 01:44:13.310]  That's your support.
[01:44:13.350 --> 01:44:14.771]  Plus, you get great products you already need.
[01:44:15.592 --> 01:44:16.493]  Take action today.
[01:44:16.953 --> 01:44:19.475]  You know, they came out and abandoned the Betsy Ross flag.
[01:44:19.695 --> 01:44:20.435]  We sold 10,000 of them.
[01:44:20.495 --> 01:44:21.696]  And that sounds like a lot of money.
[01:44:21.736 --> 01:44:23.977]  It's not to run this operation, but to put a lot of the shirts on the streets.
[01:44:24.018 --> 01:44:24.398]  That's great.
[01:44:24.438 --> 01:44:24.678]  Thank you.
[01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:27.760]  We sold 7,000 of the Space Force shirt that spreads the word.
[01:44:27.780 --> 01:44:29.201]  It's a nice, comfortable, cool shirt.
[01:44:29.241 --> 01:44:29.481]  Fun.
[01:44:29.561 --> 01:44:33.604]  We sold 100,000 of the Hillary for Prison shirts, but I sold half of them at $5 it cost.
[01:44:33.644 --> 01:44:35.385]  These shirts cost more because they're nicer fabric.
[01:44:35.425 --> 01:44:36.666]  Space Shirts are like $12.
[01:44:36.866 --> 01:44:38.127]  The XXL is even more.
[01:44:38.307 --> 01:44:40.608]  So, these are designer shirts that would be $25, $35 in stores.
[01:44:41.909 --> 01:44:42.209]  I just want
[01:45:00.834 --> 01:45:09.061]  It's not like we're just one of the programs out there fighting them.
[01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:10.603]  We're the one that's got their number.
[01:45:10.743 --> 01:45:12.464]  They don't like our spirit.
[01:45:12.484 --> 01:45:14.586]  Because believe me, it's the opposite of Satanism.
[01:45:14.606 --> 01:45:21.733]  And it may come off as aggressive and a little hateful sometimes, because it's, you know, that's the Holy Spirit shining through my dirty earth suit.
[01:45:22.802 --> 01:45:23.343]  And you know what?
[01:45:23.363 --> 01:45:29.629]  The truth is, at least out of the Bible and history, most people God used to go after evil were not a bunch of candy asses.
[01:45:29.929 --> 01:45:32.311]  We're not up there all telling you how holy they were all day long.
[01:45:34.113 --> 01:45:38.217]  So I'm not going to just up here and put on some sweetsy act for people.
[01:45:38.237 --> 01:45:39.478]  Because I don't have the energy to do it.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:41.801]  I can't be fake.
[01:45:41.821 --> 01:45:43.082]  I just don't have it in me.
[01:45:44.706 --> 01:45:48.473]  In fact, if anything, I just hold back just how really pissed off I am.
[01:45:48.553 --> 01:45:49.755]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:45:50.176 --> 01:45:53.182]  If you're not angry about what's happening, there's something wrong with you.
[01:45:53.583 --> 01:45:54.785]  And I know you're pissed.
[01:45:55.266 --> 01:45:56.629]  Let's put that anger into action.
[01:46:05.222 --> 01:46:07.923]  When it comes to rebuilding your energy, convenience is key.
[01:46:08.263 --> 01:46:14.164]  While coffee, candy, and other sugary products can give you a short boost, the crash can leave you more tired than ever.
[01:46:14.704 --> 01:46:26.687]  Turbo Force from InfoWars Life is a powerful mix-in energy packet that utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years to provide you focus, clarity, and a boost of energy on the go.

[01:47:05.347 --> 01:47:09.462]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:09.964 --> 01:47:11.289]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:26.346 --> 01:47:29.390]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:32.333]  Run on for a long time.
[01:47:32.974 --> 01:47:35.136]  Run on for a long time.
[01:47:35.817 --> 01:47:45.267]  Sooner or later God... Now we come here not as conquerors, but as liberators to return control of this city to the people.
[01:47:46.584 --> 01:47:58.460]  I'll get more into Joker in a moment, but first let's go back to Dark Knight Rises with Bane and his whole French Revolution outfit and fire rises and we're bringing down society and oh it's so edgy.
[01:47:59.021 --> 01:48:02.826]  I went and saw the movie and said it's a communist Jacobin French Revolution push.
[01:48:03.547 --> 01:48:04.388]  What the left wants.
[01:48:04.928 --> 01:48:09.493]  And then later I read a review where the director, after it had been out a few months, said that was the whole point.
[01:48:09.953 --> 01:48:12.396]  This is incredibly transparent.
[01:48:12.936 --> 01:48:20.564]  The French Revolution, in mainline history books, was carried out by the Illuminati, set up by Adam Weishaupt, in Germany.
[01:48:21.482 --> 01:48:22.202]  That was their model.
[01:48:22.642 --> 01:48:24.383]  They tried to hijack our revolution.
[01:48:25.003 --> 01:48:27.764]  George Washington wrote a bunch of letters that are in the National Archives.
[01:48:27.984 --> 01:48:34.926]  Here's one on screen, talking about how this Luciferian cult of devil worshippers was trying to hijack our revolution.
[01:48:35.666 --> 01:48:39.827]  At first, Thomas Jefferson thought they were good, went over there, and they almost killed him.
[01:48:40.427 --> 01:48:42.648]  If you want to understand the new Joker film,
[01:48:43.508 --> 01:48:55.943]  Understand Charlie Manson in the late 1960s going and killing Sharon Tate and cutting a baby out of her womb and then trying to blame it on black people to trigger a race war.
[01:48:56.184 --> 01:48:59.768]  And he said he wanted a race war and that he had worked with the CIA.
[01:49:00.529 --> 01:49:03.430]  And it turned out he had worked with them in MKUltra.
[01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:07.051]  Show head Theodore Kaczynski, the UNA bomber.
[01:49:07.291 --> 01:49:10.072]  That's LA Times, Associated Press, Washington Post.
[01:49:10.392 --> 01:49:11.713]  We're supposed to forget all of this.
[01:49:12.073 --> 01:49:28.398]  And now Hollywood admits they're trying to cause a civil war by confiscating firearms, by creating racial tension, by staging events like Jesse Smollett got caught doing, and hundreds of others where they've been caught, and still hundreds of others where they have still gotten away with it.
[01:49:29.636 --> 01:49:31.598]  The system wants you to be a victim.
[01:49:32.519 --> 01:49:35.061]  They want to glorify people that are seen as victims.
[01:49:35.421 --> 01:49:38.744]  They want to glorify mental illness and are creating new ones all the time.
[01:49:39.325 --> 01:49:41.206]  You see the Joker, he has Tourette Syndrome.
[01:49:41.486 --> 01:49:42.207]  He's a loser.
[01:49:42.247 --> 01:49:43.588]  He lives in his mommy's basement.
[01:49:44.089 --> 01:49:56.360]  And when you read the WikiLeaks from Hillary Clinton, she's talking trash about how her supporters live in their mother's basements, are all baristas, and want more money from her, but she can't deliver it to them, but she's got to lie to them.
[01:49:57.236 --> 01:50:00.378]  And that's what this film is all about.
[01:50:00.398 --> 01:50:02.039]  90% of the college educations are worthless.
[01:50:02.379 --> 01:50:03.800]  They're designed to be worthless.
[01:50:04.241 --> 01:50:09.344]  You're going and paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for something where the job and the industry doesn't exist.
[01:50:09.784 --> 01:50:20.231]  But then they tell you, oh, the conservatives have stopped us, the nationalists, the capitalists, from bringing in this utopia where you're going to have jobs managing everything.
[01:50:20.771 --> 01:50:28.543]  But because they haven't gone along with this, the managed economy, the carbon taxes, the social workers running everybody's families...
[01:50:29.454 --> 01:50:36.401]  We're going to have to have a violent overthrow and a tearing down of civilization to be able to carry this out.
[01:50:36.521 --> 01:50:39.183]  And then, then we'll have the utopia.
[01:50:39.664 --> 01:50:43.447]  Same thing we heard from Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mao.
[01:50:43.787 --> 01:50:50.173]  But all it created was a nightmare for the general public that killed hundreds of millions of people and started giant wars.
[01:50:50.834 --> 01:50:55.736]  But you see, that's the whole point of this priesthood, the priest of power.
[01:50:56.256 --> 01:51:08.941]  George Orwell, Eric Blair, who actually worked for MI6 before that OSS, worked in the Ministry of Truth for real at BBC, wrote 1984 about the real world they were going to build.
[01:51:10.642 --> 01:51:13.043]  He is O'Brien and Winston in the book.
[01:51:13.083 --> 01:51:14.123]  He wrote essays admitting it.
[01:51:15.575 --> 01:51:18.556]  And O'Brien tells him, Winston, we're here to trample people and be trampled.
[01:51:18.717 --> 01:51:20.077]  We're here to make society ugly.
[01:51:20.217 --> 01:51:25.040]  We're here to end the family and tear down everything and finally just kill all humans on Earth.
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:27.541]  We are the post-human movement.
[01:51:28.121 --> 01:51:28.821]  We are Satan.
[01:51:29.162 --> 01:51:30.162]  We kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:51:30.702 --> 01:51:32.283]  And now you turn on NBC.
[01:51:32.743 --> 01:51:33.604]  Look at the London Guardian.
[01:51:33.784 --> 01:51:34.284]  It's everywhere.
[01:51:34.444 --> 01:51:35.445]  The post-human world.
[01:51:35.485 --> 01:51:36.465]  How ugly humans are.
[01:51:36.665 --> 01:51:37.326]  How bad we are.
[01:51:38.146 --> 01:51:51.912]  So the very people telling the dumbed-down, poisoned, brainwashed masses who went into debt for worthless educations, that it's all the fault of Christians and nationalistic conservatives, and that they've got to overthrow things to have a future.
[01:51:53.186 --> 01:52:11.898]  That is the very Hollywood, megabank, Chicom-backed and owned system pumping cultural poison into this nation to cause a massive collapse of civilization, like they call for in Clarendon Pivot Strategies, to then usher in their system of total control and authoritarianism.
[01:52:12.279 --> 01:52:13.179]  And that's the model.
[01:52:13.580 --> 01:52:21.245]  And that's why you see all the films about race war and death and destruction and the downtrodden going out and conducting mass shootings and mass killings.
[01:52:21.465 --> 01:52:22.506]  And all the studies show that
[01:52:23.406 --> 01:52:34.999]  Mass shootings are literally triggered when the media hypes them up and mentally ill people on medications that on the inserts admit they cause people to commit suicide or murder others.
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:38.323]  But oh, they've all been given liability protection.
[01:52:39.636 --> 01:52:53.192]  This is an admitted plan by ultra-rich running multinational corporations allied with the EU, the Chai Koms, and radical Islam and others on record to destabilize the Western world in the Renaissance and overthrow it and bring in this tyranny.
[01:52:53.893 --> 01:52:56.256]  All in the name of human empowerment.
[01:52:58.188 --> 01:52:59.328]  They are the bullies.
[01:52:59.948 --> 01:53:01.229]  The Joker is the bully.
[01:53:01.989 --> 01:53:17.792]  The power structure and the system is laughing at everyone and dangling in front of them the promise of something great and free health care and free school and free money and free jobs and free housing and free everything if you'll just sign on to their revolution.
[01:53:18.372 --> 01:53:20.473]  But in the end, all you get is death and destruction.
[01:53:21.473 --> 01:53:22.193]  Here's the good news.
[01:53:22.693 --> 01:53:25.874]  These Jokers would have you believe they're the most powerful card in the deck.
[01:53:26.735 --> 01:53:37.704]  But when you know they're the Joker, when you know they're scammers, when you know that they're trying to enslave you by creating a crisis they control, and then a solution that they offer with the Igalian dialectic, they have no more power.
[01:53:38.445 --> 01:53:52.737]  Because the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, the Ace of Spades is knowledge and historical understanding and a good, loving heart towards others, but also the will to stand against these bullies, these Jokers, and let them know you're not going to submit to them.
[01:53:53.277 --> 01:53:55.059]  All they are is a scarecrow, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:56.417 --> 01:53:59.399]  Trying to keep you from taking your destiny of being a free human being.
[01:54:00.279 --> 01:54:05.423]  And they put all these sad, pathetic people into these systems and suck their future and suck their dreams away.
[01:54:05.803 --> 01:54:11.066]  And then offer them fiery communist revolution as a way to be empowered.
[01:54:11.586 --> 01:54:18.451]  And every time the fools that do this end up being the first who are killed by their masters.
[01:54:19.994 --> 01:54:23.976]  The Joker wants to destroy Gotham, bring it down, teach them a lesson.
[01:54:24.356 --> 01:54:28.818]  Well, Bill Maher's up there saying, crash the economy to teach Americans not to support Trump.
[01:54:29.118 --> 01:54:34.681]  The private fellow reserve is trying to crash the economy to teach us Americans that populism and loving our country is not good.
[01:54:35.682 --> 01:54:42.085]  It's incredible what real world terrorists, real world jokers and banes these individuals are.
[01:54:42.984 --> 01:54:48.647]  And Hollywood thinks you're so stupid, they're throwing it on your face and saying, oh, it's so complex, you can't understand it.
[01:54:49.288 --> 01:54:56.012]  I was watching Bird Box for 10 minutes and could see it was some signal over the cell phones making people kill themselves, just like the Kingsmen.
[01:54:56.452 --> 01:54:58.713]  They're telling you what they're doing to you.
[01:54:59.073 --> 01:55:00.874]  They're telling you how they're poisoning the water.
[01:55:01.115 --> 01:55:02.916]  They're telling you how they're dumbing you down.
[01:55:03.516 --> 01:55:04.036]  I want to be clear.
[01:55:04.076 --> 01:55:05.497]  Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor.
[01:55:05.737 --> 01:55:07.238]  I wish him and the directors no harm.
[01:55:07.678 --> 01:55:13.120]  But they're just carrying out an agenda, a replay of the same thing that we're shown over and over and over again.
[01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:24.285]  The truth is it's not cool to be a violent revolutionary trying to overthrow families and overthrow culture and overthrow society so you can build something ugly on top of it and then act like you're actually a rebel.
[01:55:24.665 --> 01:55:25.746]  You don't have to kill.
[01:55:25.946 --> 01:55:28.068]  You don't have to become satanic to have power.
[01:55:28.629 --> 01:55:36.096]  You don't have to go out and do horrible things to be somebody and show the world, show the bullies, that you're not going to put up with it.
[01:55:36.597 --> 01:55:37.558]  But that's what the left does.
[01:55:37.578 --> 01:55:42.903]  They teach their minions in the colleges, while they're giving them worthless degrees, that you're all victims.
[01:55:43.343 --> 01:55:46.607]  And then when there's nobody really victimizing them, they go, oh, well, there's microaggressions.
[01:55:47.067 --> 01:55:48.949]  So you've got to go out and take over society.
[01:55:49.129 --> 01:55:50.791]  You've got to brainwash people's children.
[01:55:50.971 --> 01:55:54.675]  You've got to get control of education so that these evils don't happen to you anymore.
[01:55:55.496 --> 01:56:01.121]  And really, you're just a bunch of idiots following the Joker and his operation.
[01:56:01.762 --> 01:56:03.964]  Well, the age of the Joker is coming to an end.
[01:56:04.926 --> 01:56:07.428]  But Hollywood sees the Joker as their identity.
[01:56:08.088 --> 01:56:10.389]  And that's why they put him up there and celebrate him.
[01:56:10.830 --> 01:56:12.171]  Because that's their archetype.
[01:56:12.331 --> 01:56:12.971]  The conman.
[01:56:13.231 --> 01:56:13.992]  The scam artist.
[01:56:14.212 --> 01:56:14.872]  The pedophile.
[01:56:15.132 --> 01:56:15.933]  The serial killer.
[01:56:16.333 --> 01:56:16.813]  The Hitler.
[01:56:17.074 --> 01:56:17.634]  The Stalin.
[01:56:17.854 --> 01:56:18.234]  The Mao.
[01:56:19.135 --> 01:56:22.177]  You can take the ace of spades in your hand anytime you want.
[01:56:22.777 --> 01:56:25.339]  And start being a straight and strong and truthful person.
[01:56:25.799 --> 01:56:28.701]  And standing up to build a better, safer, good community.
[01:56:29.141 --> 01:56:33.244]  And rediscovering the values that made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.
[01:56:40.143 --> 01:56:44.070]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[01:56:44.290 --> 01:56:47.415]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[01:56:51.605 --> 01:56:55.810]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:57.792]  This is the heart of 1776.
[01:56:58.112 --> 01:57:03.678]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[01:57:03.738 --> 01:57:10.324]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[01:57:15.748 --> 01:57:21.871]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[01:57:21.911 --> 01:57:26.372]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[01:57:26.392 --> 01:57:29.334]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[01:57:31.895 --> 01:57:36.557]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[01:57:36.717 --> 01:57:41.559]  From the front lines of the Info Room, it's Alex Jones.
[01:57:54.548 --> 01:57:56.390]  We are in an information war.
[01:57:58.331 --> 01:58:07.498]  Our objective is to destroy the false narrative by reminding as many people as possible to think for themselves and question everything.
[01:58:09.056 --> 01:58:12.097]  We were effective, and so they tried to destroy us.
[01:58:12.517 --> 01:58:18.318]  Alex Jones' YouTube channel posted a video that was seen by 2.3 million subscribers.
[01:58:18.478 --> 01:58:22.959]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[01:58:23.379 --> 01:58:27.579]  This stuff is not speech, it's incitement, harassment, defamation.
[01:58:28.199 --> 01:58:34.561]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[01:58:34.901 --> 01:58:35.741]  We survived.
[01:58:36.661 --> 01:58:37.561]  But we were wounded.
[01:58:38.082 --> 01:58:48.507]  Apple, Facebook, Spotify, Vimeo, YouTube, Twitter, all of them pulled or froze Jones' accounts on the grounds that his views are too dangerous to be heard publicly.
[01:58:48.927 --> 01:58:51.868]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:55.170]  Obviously what he views is hate and it's abhorrent.
[01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:58.772]  We have crossed the Rubicon and there is no turning back.
[01:59:00.051 --> 01:59:02.233]  We must push through to victory.
[01:59:03.354 --> 01:59:06.757]  And so now more than ever, we need your support.
[01:59:08.198 --> 01:59:12.242]  Our products at Infowarsstore.com are like war bonds.
[01:59:13.042 --> 01:59:15.925]  Make a purchase today and support the fight.
[01:59:17.646 --> 01:59:21.109]  There is now open talk of repealing the Second Amendment.
[01:59:21.150 --> 01:59:25.714]  The NRA is being designated as a terrorist organization.
[01:59:27.096 --> 01:59:31.778]  People are being arrested for personal opinions they post online.
[01:59:33.158 --> 01:59:36.920]  We will continue to question everything and fight until the end.
[01:59:38.260 --> 01:59:41.962]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and keep the fight alive.
[01:59:41.982 --> 01:59:45.163]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:59:45.183 --> 01:59:47.183]  They didn't call out Fox News by name.
[01:59:47.223 --> 01:59:49.044]  They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[01:59:49.084 --> 01:59:50.885]  He's specifically calling you out.
[01:59:56.318 --> 02:00:14.964]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:15.904 --> 02:00:18.405]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:18.525 --> 02:00:19.985]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.237 --> 02:00:25.778]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:26.139 --> 02:00:28.220]  Tom Pampert still sitting in for Alex.
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:32.722]  That was another fantastic report by Mr. Jones himself.
[02:00:33.542 --> 02:00:38.305]  So, it's almost time for that bizarre Facebook event.
[02:00:38.825 --> 02:00:40.506]  Storm Area 51.
[02:00:40.586 --> 02:00:42.287]  They can't stop us all.
[02:00:42.327 --> 02:00:44.048]  Well, I think they probably can.
[02:00:44.148 --> 02:00:45.468]  I would never recommend such a thing.
[02:00:45.488 --> 02:00:48.710]  I mean, you're essentially talking about an insurrection against the U.S.
[02:00:48.730 --> 02:00:52.132]  government, but it's very... I mean, I think it's just a Facebook meme.
[02:00:52.412 --> 02:01:02.821]  I don't think anybody really has an intention to storm Area 51, and it kind of seems like a distraction, but what's been fascinating is all of the responses from the United States government.
[02:01:02.861 --> 02:01:05.603]  We now have another from the Daily Star.
[02:01:05.804 --> 02:01:14.211]  Area 51 has secrets that deserve to be protected, warns US Air Force General.
[02:01:16.124 --> 02:01:19.925]  I think they're taking the meme a bit too seriously.
[02:01:20.566 --> 02:01:20.826]  U.S.
[02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:24.387]  Air Force officials have already warned they stood ready to defend the military base.
[02:01:25.087 --> 02:01:27.988]  Now we have General Dave Goldfein.
[02:01:28.008 --> 02:01:35.550]  He's issued a strong warning against anyone planning to storm Area 51 to see them aliens.
[02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:38.631]  Area 51 has secrets that deserve to be protected.
[02:01:40.438 --> 02:01:45.085]  It's a very strange situation, especially when you consider that the U.S.
[02:01:45.185 --> 02:01:49.351]  Navy has now essentially admitted that, yes, they're tracking UFOs.
[02:01:51.230 --> 02:01:53.831]  It's a strange time to be alive, is it not ladies and gentlemen?
[02:01:54.291 --> 02:02:06.674]  Strange flying objects captured on video by a Navy Finder pilots off the coast of San Diego in 2004 and Atlantic waters in 2015 were acknowledged by the Navy as unidentified aerial phenomena last week.
[02:02:07.094 --> 02:02:07.994]  We've got a clip on that.
[02:02:08.034 --> 02:02:10.975]  Let's go ahead and air some of this clip here if we can.
[02:02:11.055 --> 02:02:12.595]  Clip 10 to the control room.
[02:02:15.456 --> 02:02:19.137]  Official USG footage brought to you exclusively by the Navy.
[02:02:20.452 --> 02:02:21.492]  The second of three U.S.
[02:02:21.512 --> 02:02:27.434]  military videos of unidentified aerial phenomena been declassified.
[02:02:28.154 --> 02:02:33.175]  This is the only official footage that has been released that was taken during the 2004 Nemitz incident.
[02:02:34.195 --> 02:02:34.975]  Taken aboard U.S.
[02:02:35.035 --> 02:02:37.716]  Navy F-A-18 Super Hornet.
[02:02:38.536 --> 02:02:45.758]  The footage was captured by tracking systems most advanced on the market.
[02:02:47.179 --> 02:02:52.221]  Here you can see their display information, giving some background information about what we're going to see here.
[02:02:53.601 --> 02:02:57.122]  Sensor is in the TV visual mode, so we're seeing as a camera.
[02:03:01.624 --> 02:03:02.944]  Sensor zoom is only 1.0.
[02:03:06.579 --> 02:03:10.002]  Sensor aimed six degree above the aircraft axis.
[02:03:11.043 --> 02:03:14.145]  Breaking down exactly what we're going to see.
[02:03:14.706 --> 02:03:18.309]  Showing the speed for radio viewers, radio listeners.
[02:03:20.730 --> 02:03:24.433]  Explaining the hot and cold.
[02:03:24.674 --> 02:03:26.615]  White is hot, black is cold.
[02:03:26.635 --> 02:03:29.157]  All right.
[02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.662]  So here is our unidentified phenomena.
[02:03:36.553 --> 02:03:37.034]  In the air.
[02:03:38.115 --> 02:03:46.803]  And this comes, by the way, as Bernie Sanders has made part of his campaign a promise to declassify the UFOs.
[02:03:50.106 --> 02:03:56.512]  Now, I am by no means a UFO truther, but it is just fascinating to see
[02:03:57.759 --> 02:04:06.364]  The military confronting an internet meme as this type of information becomes public for the first time.
[02:04:08.025 --> 02:04:17.672]  Many will remember in WikiLeaks, former astronauts begging a potential Clinton administration to declassify UFOs.
[02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:22.575]  It's really bizarre.
[02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:24.716]  It's a bizarre time to be alive.
[02:04:24.816 --> 02:04:25.617]  When we come back,
[02:04:26.374 --> 02:04:32.743]  We're going to talk about reality TV, or as I like to call it, the presidential election in 2020.
[02:04:32.823 --> 02:04:37.630]  Because there's a new headline out, reality TV story producers face decreasing wages!
[02:04:38.379 --> 02:04:39.439]  I can't ever imagine why.
[02:04:39.479 --> 02:04:44.340]  Could it be that reality is now more fascinating than reality TV?
[02:04:45.140 --> 02:04:46.280]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:49.421]  I'm Tom Pappard filling in on this hour.
[02:04:49.681 --> 02:04:50.621]  Alex may be joining us.
[02:04:50.661 --> 02:04:51.381]  We'll find out.
[02:04:51.501 --> 02:04:52.742]  He's landing right now.
[02:04:52.982 --> 02:04:54.722]  Just did a very important podcast.
[02:04:55.382 --> 02:04:56.922]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:57.462 --> 02:04:59.543]  I'll be back in just a few minutes.
[02:05:12.279 --> 02:05:16.643]  I'll tell you about that later, but you want to find out.
[02:05:16.803 --> 02:05:21.047]  It's Info Wars now, but soon it'll be everybody else wants to resist.
[02:05:21.067 --> 02:05:22.548]  We are building an army to bring down the
[02:05:36.545 --> 02:05:37.806]  So get out the way!
[02:05:38.066 --> 02:05:39.206]  Move, bitch!
[02:05:39.266 --> 02:05:40.307]  Get out the way!
[02:05:40.327 --> 02:05:41.648]  Move out the way, bitch!
[02:05:41.708 --> 02:05:42.608]  Get out the way!
[02:05:42.628 --> 02:05:43.709]  Sorry.
[02:05:44.669 --> 02:05:45.970]  Quoting Ludacris here.
[02:05:47.010 --> 02:05:48.231]  Move, O'Donnell!
[02:05:48.311 --> 02:05:49.231]  Get out the way!
[02:05:49.552 --> 02:05:50.532]  Move, O'Donnell!
[02:05:50.592 --> 02:05:51.493]  Get out the way!
[02:05:51.713 --> 02:05:52.513]  Get out the way!
[02:05:52.673 --> 02:05:53.574]  You see them headlights?
[02:05:53.834 --> 02:05:55.214]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[02:05:55.234 --> 02:05:57.195]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[02:05:57.255 --> 02:05:57.896]  Tell me that!
[02:05:58.636 --> 02:05:59.657]  Get out of my way!
[02:05:59.677 --> 02:06:01.958]  That's Americana, bitch!
[02:06:20.584 --> 02:06:24.473]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:26.076 --> 02:06:30.806]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:35.737 --> 02:06:38.419]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:38.499 --> 02:06:43.564]  I am Tom Pappert filling in for Alex as he returns from a very important podcast.
[02:06:43.624 --> 02:06:44.905]  I can't wait till that thing goes live.
[02:06:44.945 --> 02:06:47.166]  Keep an eye out for it over the next couple weeks.
[02:06:48.247 --> 02:06:54.392]  Reality TV story producers are facing decreasing wages and tougher working conditions.
[02:06:54.473 --> 02:06:55.573]  Where would America be?
[02:06:56.334 --> 02:06:57.975]  Without reality television.
[02:06:58.615 --> 02:07:01.256]  It's honestly been a bane of TV for the past decade or so.
[02:07:01.316 --> 02:07:05.158]  I come from the broadcast industry originally and there is nothing innovative about it.
[02:07:05.478 --> 02:07:08.199]  So this is a... it's a very peculiar article.
[02:07:08.900 --> 02:07:11.521]  But I think it says something about where our society is going.
[02:07:12.281 --> 02:07:18.844]  As declining ratings crunch budgets, unscripted writing talents continue to put in some of the small screen's most punishing hours.
[02:07:19.024 --> 02:07:21.245]  Quote, there's not enough Adderall to stay awake.
[02:07:22.066 --> 02:07:23.766]  Oh, I'm sure there's enough Adderall for you.
[02:07:24.287 --> 02:07:24.747]  Natalie
[02:07:25.487 --> 02:07:32.131]  is a pseudonym used in this article, was scrambling for a job last spring when she received an offer to work on the latest season of E!'
[02:07:32.051 --> 02:07:34.152]  's Keeping Up with the Kardashians.
[02:07:34.872 --> 02:07:46.479]  A story producer with 13 years of experience, Natalie, had been hired for another show that fell apart, so she was grateful to receive the offer until production company Buena Murray called her with the rate $1,100 a week.
[02:07:48.899 --> 02:07:51.321]  I don't know who can't live off $1,100 a week.
[02:07:51.601 --> 02:07:54.503]  Is that how inflated these people's ego and lifestyle is?
[02:07:54.543 --> 02:07:55.584]  Where are they living?
[02:07:55.604 --> 02:07:57.926]  In the richest New York neighborhood?
[02:07:58.086 --> 02:07:58.527]  It's bizarre.
[02:07:58.807 --> 02:08:00.708]  She says, I audibly gasped!
[02:08:01.008 --> 02:08:05.052]  She depended on her usual rate of $2,500 a week to support her family.
[02:08:05.762 --> 02:08:15.528]  With an average of 1.9 million total viewers in its 16th season, Kardashians remains an influential show, and Natalie was being offered little more than what a production assistant makes in a week.
[02:08:15.729 --> 02:08:20.312]  She said, it made me angry, because I knew that someone's going to take that job.
[02:08:21.933 --> 02:08:23.654]  People really don't like the free market, do they?
[02:08:23.694 --> 02:08:29.258]  But since 2016, reality TV has been on its way out.
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:32.264]  Something that people predicted would happen much earlier.
[02:08:32.304 --> 02:08:35.829]  They thought it would be a flash in the pan in the mid-2000s and it would be over.
[02:08:36.430 --> 02:08:37.592]  But I think I know the reason.
[02:08:38.973 --> 02:08:40.174]  And that's reality.
[02:08:40.234 --> 02:08:41.234]  It's just getting interesting.
[02:08:41.374 --> 02:08:42.835]  Thanks to President Trump, I would say.
[02:08:42.995 --> 02:08:44.396]  And the likes of Alex Jones.
[02:08:45.197 --> 02:08:47.418]  So, they're puffing up Elizabeth Warren.
[02:08:47.478 --> 02:08:49.359]  Pocahontas, for those who haven't noticed this.
[02:08:49.399 --> 02:08:55.042]  This is the left's attempt to recreate the magic of 2016 and 2015 with President Trump.
[02:08:55.062 --> 02:08:57.243]  This is an article up at heavy.com.
[02:08:57.304 --> 02:08:59.465]  Maybe we can show some of these photos on screen.
[02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:02.887]  Thousands hack Elizabeth Warren's New York rally.
[02:09:03.467 --> 02:09:05.249]  Look at these crowd-sized photos.
[02:09:05.809 --> 02:09:07.391]  There's a couple things right off the top.
[02:09:07.551 --> 02:09:12.816]  One, this is outside, and so it makes it kind of difficult to tell exactly how many people are there.
[02:09:13.377 --> 02:09:16.260]  Wouldn't it be nice if President Trump could do a rally outside?
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:18.542]  I don't think that would end well for the president.
[02:09:19.263 --> 02:09:20.604]  There's too many security risks.
[02:09:20.624 --> 02:09:22.726]  But Warren, because she is a puppet,
[02:09:23.578 --> 02:09:25.738]  Because she is what the globalist wants.
[02:09:26.539 --> 02:09:27.839]  She can do a rally outside.
[02:09:28.479 --> 02:09:31.000]  But you notice, these are supposed to be crowd-sized photos.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:32.540]  They're tight shots.
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:35.901]  Are they doing to her what they do to President Trump and they don't show the crowds?
[02:09:35.941 --> 02:09:37.021]  It does make you wonder.
[02:09:37.061 --> 02:09:44.463]  But she says, her campaign says, I should say, 20,000 people in attendance.
[02:09:45.543 --> 02:09:46.243]  There's another article.
[02:09:47.381 --> 02:09:54.165]  NBC, Wall Street Journal poll, Biden leads Democrat 2020 field, but Warren's support is growing.
[02:09:54.626 --> 02:09:55.466]  It's very interesting.
[02:09:55.506 --> 02:10:04.572]  I mean, I think Alex predicted years ago, and I think I did too, that Warren would be the globalist pick to run against President Trump in 2020.
[02:10:05.853 --> 02:10:09.035]  So it's very, it's fascinating the way this is going, but
[02:10:09.926 --> 02:10:12.668]  Here's another one from CT Post.
[02:10:12.848 --> 02:10:14.890]  New focus on crowd sizes.
[02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:16.932]  Warren, Vint, Rivals, Trump!
[02:10:17.752 --> 02:10:24.298]  You see, the Democrats have been kind of in panic mode these last several years as their crowd sizes have been non-existent.
[02:10:24.338 --> 02:10:26.079]  We all remember Jeb Bush.
[02:10:26.479 --> 02:10:28.361]  He was lucky to get 15 people in a room.
[02:10:29.141 --> 02:10:30.783]  The Democrats have been largely the same.
[02:10:30.803 --> 02:10:35.627]  Vito O'Rourke, who wants to take your guns, recently got, I think, what?
[02:10:36.633 --> 02:10:37.754]  Fifteen people in a room?
[02:10:38.375 --> 02:10:42.379]  He met in a kindergarten school classroom here recently.
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:46.764]  So President Trump is rightly mocking Elizabeth Warren's crowd.
[02:10:46.784 --> 02:10:55.013]  By the way, this was in New York City, the epicenter of all liberal debauchery, right up there with Los Angeles.
[02:10:55.213 --> 02:10:56.495]  Said anybody could do that.
[02:10:57.512 --> 02:11:08.305]  Mocking her openly, and I think that's a good point because here is a story, or here's a tweet I should say, from Brad Parscale, President Trump's campaign manager going into 2020.
[02:11:08.405 --> 02:11:09.967]  He's also the digital strategist from 2016.
[02:11:15.574 --> 02:11:17.676]  45,000 people registered for tickets.
[02:11:17.696 --> 02:11:20.079]  94% were from within New Mexico.
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:24.143]  78% of registrants matched to voter file.
[02:11:24.904 --> 02:11:34.214]  Over 20% voted in one or zero of the last four elections, meaning they might have voted in 2016 or they might not have voted in a decade or more.
[02:11:35.709 --> 02:11:38.150]  52% were male, 48% female.
[02:11:38.410 --> 02:11:39.711]  Great numbers for President Trump.
[02:11:39.751 --> 02:11:41.452]  I thought women hate the guy.
[02:11:41.472 --> 02:11:44.173]  40% were Latino, and 31% were Democrat.
[02:11:44.193 --> 02:11:46.514]  But that's the big thing right there.
[02:11:46.534 --> 02:11:46.994]  45,000 people.
[02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:55.922]  45,000 people registered for this rally, but Elizabeth Warren's allegedly getting 20,000, even though it couldn't be confirmed.
[02:11:55.982 --> 02:11:58.302]  And this is not something new, by the way.
[02:11:58.962 --> 02:12:04.744]  Anybody who has been following President Trump, anybody who is watching this broadcast, frankly, will remember this little blast from the past.
[02:12:04.884 --> 02:12:07.304]  August 21st, 2015, it's a CNN article.
[02:12:08.985 --> 02:12:12.406]  30,000 turnout for Trump's Alabama pep rally.
[02:12:13.246 --> 02:12:14.666]  This has been happening since 2015.
[02:12:17.435 --> 02:12:20.356]  And that's why the Democrats are trying to puff up Elizabeth Warren.
[02:12:20.376 --> 02:12:21.337]  She is their answer!
[02:12:22.837 --> 02:12:23.637]  She's their answer.
[02:12:23.677 --> 02:12:25.718]  That's how pathetic things have really gotten.
[02:12:25.738 --> 02:12:32.461]  Because, of course, Warren has simply adopted the majority of Bernie Sanders' platform.
[02:12:32.881 --> 02:12:38.903]  And she's going to be the globalist pawn, the sheepdog, who will lead them all back to globalism.
[02:12:39.324 --> 02:12:40.544]  It's a fascinating thing to see.
[02:12:40.604 --> 02:12:44.706]  But speaking of the reality TV type situation we're in,
[02:12:45.586 --> 02:12:47.006]  Have you noticed they're using children?
[02:12:47.086 --> 02:12:49.987]  So, we had Soph, she was on InfoWars a couple months ago.
[02:12:50.007 --> 02:12:54.888]  Y'all remember the 14-year-old wonderkid who was devastating the internet with her commentary?
[02:12:54.928 --> 02:12:55.708]  Well, she's been banned.
[02:12:55.748 --> 02:12:56.308]  She's gone now.
[02:12:56.749 --> 02:12:59.089]  Not really, because you can ban people and they still exist.
[02:12:59.929 --> 02:13:07.151]  But the left is trying to puff up this European climate change activist who is a young child.
[02:13:07.171 --> 02:13:11.632]  And let's just roll this bizarre clip, if we can, back in the control room.
[02:13:12.585 --> 02:13:19.266]  New England's climate change representative Greta Thunberg has been hailed by comedian Sarah Silverman as the second coming.
[02:13:19.486 --> 02:13:22.527]  Thunberg has made rounds on the left's propaganda circuit.
[02:13:22.847 --> 02:13:25.207]  Everyone always asks me about Donald Trump.
[02:13:26.828 --> 02:13:34.049]  But, I mean, my message for him is just listen to the science and he obviously doesn't do that.
[02:13:34.509 --> 02:13:39.910]  Is it that climate change just strikes you as so big that you felt moved by that?
[02:13:41.345 --> 02:13:50.672]  Yes, I mean, the climate crisis is the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced, and if we don't do anything right now, we're screwed.
[02:13:50.992 --> 02:13:56.056]  Sweden, in Germany, people are starting to call it the Greta effect, where people are taking more trains.
[02:13:56.116 --> 02:13:59.999]  Since you started this movement, they've said they feel ashamed to fly unnecessarily in Europe.
[02:14:00.299 --> 02:14:09.906]  All of this after Thunberg sailed from England to New York, representing the UN's tyrannical sustainability goals on her so-called zero-emissions voyage.
[02:14:10.106 --> 02:14:17.230]  But the zero emissions trip was a scam, as four sailors had to fly to New York and relieve the crew to take the ship back.
[02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:23.073]  Regardless, the arrogance of the UN and the media supporting Thunberg hailed her as victorious.
[02:14:23.253 --> 02:14:29.976]  She wants governments to act to save kids like her from climate devastation, as though governments can regulate it.
[02:14:30.316 --> 02:14:31.677]  And if you dare criticize her,
[02:14:32.549 --> 02:14:38.055]  Not only are you a child bully, but you are someone who's mean to people with disabilities.
[02:14:38.115 --> 02:14:39.377]  And this is how they have it set up.
[02:14:39.417 --> 02:14:47.826]  She's the perfect, from beginning to end, you know, puppet slash spokesman for this movement because she embodies everything that they want to do.
[02:14:48.286 --> 02:14:50.269]  Doctrinate kids, intimidate their opponents.
[02:14:50.929 --> 02:14:57.012]  Uh, and come up with platitudes of utter nonsense on a minute-by-minute basis if you follow her on Twitter.
[02:14:57.112 --> 02:15:11.418]  You can find the same arrogance like the kind found at the recent Gastro Summit talk given by the behavioral scientist and marketing strategist Magnus Söderlund from the Stockholm School of Economics, which he titled, Can You Imagine Eating Human Flesh?
[02:15:11.838 --> 02:15:21.722]  Soderlund claims that since food sources will be scarce in the future, people must be introduced to eating things they have thus far considered disgusting, among them human flesh.
[02:15:22.062 --> 02:15:30.525]  As the Epoch Times wrote, what Soderlund doesn't mention, curiously, is the long-documented science on the biological effects of cannibalism.
[02:15:30.786 --> 02:15:34.367]  A tribe called the Four lived in isolation... So there you have it.
[02:15:34.807 --> 02:15:36.468]  The new globalist actor.
[02:15:37.188 --> 02:15:41.291]  They're desperately trying to salvage the narrative right now because freedom is winning!
[02:15:41.911 --> 02:15:46.114]  The Info War is being fought and we are winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:15:46.935 --> 02:15:54.400]  So now you've got Elizabeth Warren and this disabled child who are going to get us back on track toward the race toward globalism!
[02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:56.342]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:56.742 --> 02:15:57.442]  I'm Tom Pafford.
[02:15:57.462 --> 02:16:00.304]  We'll be back after this short break.
[02:16:00.444 --> 02:16:01.865]  Stay tuned, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:03.086 --> 02:16:06.289]  I've got a message for the scumbag anti-American, Beto O'Rourke.
[02:16:07.233 --> 02:16:11.757]  You're down here thinking you can tame Texas and conquer us and destroy us like California?
[02:16:12.057 --> 02:16:15.440]  You think you can turn us into your disarmed slaves?
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:20.544]  Beto O'Rourke, you're well-known for fantasizing and writing essays about murdering children.
[02:16:20.824 --> 02:16:23.746]  And you even got away with a hit-and-run and burglary.
[02:16:24.327 --> 02:16:25.928]  You're a dirty criminal.
[02:16:26.368 --> 02:16:30.111]  You've got your own bodyguards because you're hooked into that billionaire wife of yours.
[02:16:30.552 --> 02:16:33.014]  How dare you try to demonize American gun owners?
[02:16:33.414 --> 02:16:38.055]  Just in case you didn't know, this country was founded when the Redcoats came to take the guns in 1775.
[02:16:38.335 --> 02:16:40.236]  That's why we got July 4th.
[02:16:40.276 --> 02:16:45.557]  So I'm going to tell you what George Washington and the Continental Congress told King George III.
[02:16:45.917 --> 02:16:49.778]  You're not getting our firearms because we're free men, you little piece of crap!
[02:16:50.338 --> 02:16:56.420]  America and the world's glad, though, that you finally got the guts to admit your plan with the rest of those scumbag Democrats.
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:58.920]  Beto O'Rourke, you're on notice!
[02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:01.861]  You're not getting our firearms, ever, scumbag!
[02:17:02.952 --> 02:17:06.135]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[02:17:06.576 --> 02:17:12.442]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price.
[02:17:12.462 --> 02:17:16.786]  Because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it.
[02:17:17.127 --> 02:17:19.970]  And my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[02:17:20.550 --> 02:17:22.571]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[02:17:22.631 --> 02:17:23.952]  They're getting great responses.
[02:17:24.212 --> 02:17:31.216]  They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does, taken under the tongue, where it's more absorbable.
[02:17:31.496 --> 02:17:35.479]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help
[02:17:35.979 --> 02:17:42.244]  The body produce more energy, help produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, and so much more.
[02:17:42.684 --> 02:17:49.830]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics already in your body, like vitamin B12.
[02:17:49.950 --> 02:17:57.876]  Whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're black, whether you're white, whether you live in Japan or the United States, Ultra 12 is the best vitamin B12 you're going to find out there.

[02:19:02.625 --> 02:19:03.705]  Free America Law Center.
[02:19:04.326 --> 02:19:10.588]  We started Free America Law Center because we needed a counterpart to the ACLU and to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:19:11.088 --> 02:19:16.330]  Organizations that have been legal support organizations for political causes on the left for a long time.
[02:19:16.830 --> 02:19:23.493]  But many ordinary Americans, many people on the political right or political independents, did not have that same opportunity afforded them.
[02:19:23.993 --> 02:19:27.114]  So we created the Free America Law Center to help fight back.
[02:19:27.734 --> 02:19:40.305]  Fight back particularly in the areas of big tech deplatforming, big media defamation, big government deep state whistleblowers who need protection against the institutional powers of the establishment.
[02:19:40.705 --> 02:19:43.888]  That's why we created the Free America Law Center to empower you.
[02:19:44.388 --> 02:19:54.857]  You are creating equal access and democratizing the law so that ordinary everyday Americans can fight back against big tech, big media, and big powerful institutions out to deprive them of their rights.

[02:20:25.104 --> 02:20:26.645]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:26.705 --> 02:20:28.546]  I'm Tom Paffert filling in for Alex today.
[02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:47.096]  There's some insane stuff happening south of the border, where a Vietnam essentially happens every year.
[02:20:47.156 --> 02:20:48.757]  That's how many people die in Mexico.
[02:20:48.797 --> 02:20:56.824]  But I do want to take another moment here, just briefly, to emphatically stress, I mean, InfoWars is the tip of the spear.
[02:20:57.885 --> 02:21:05.750]  Infowars is the people who break these stories that no one else will touch and Alex Jones has been proven right time and time again.
[02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:15.035]  Some days I wake up and I wish there would just be a day that would go by without another horrifying story where I just sit there and go, Alex was right again, what do you know?
[02:21:16.056 --> 02:21:33.568]  And the only way they can continue to do this, and they can continue to expand, and if you're not expanding, you're contracting, the only way that they can do this is if you go to InfoWarsStore.com, where right now, some of these deals, as I've said before, are absolutely unbelievable.

[02:22:26.526 --> 02:22:29.489]  This is your opportunity to support the Info War.
[02:22:29.549 --> 02:22:30.630]  Support Alex Jones.
[02:22:30.670 --> 02:22:32.512]  Support this broadcast.
[02:22:32.532 --> 02:22:33.934]  Support this network.
[02:22:34.810 --> 02:22:38.356]  So let's talk about what's going on in Mexico, shall we?
[02:22:38.376 --> 02:22:41.341]  Spoiler alert, it's horrifying.
[02:22:41.902 --> 02:22:46.930]  Mexican authorities find 29 bodies in a hundred plastic bags.
[02:22:47.995 --> 02:22:48.776]  This is from Reuters.
[02:22:48.856 --> 02:22:50.357]  Mexico City, September 17.
[02:22:50.417 --> 02:22:59.585]  Mexican authorities said Tuesday they found 29 bodies packed in more than 100 plastic bags dumped in a clandestine grave in a violent western state of Jalisco.
[02:23:00.365 --> 02:23:07.211]  Murders in Mexico jumped to the highest on record in the first half of the year, putting the cartel-rammaged country on track to surpass the 29,111 recorded last year.
[02:23:12.671 --> 02:23:24.404]  It's by far, it's gotta be one of the worst places to live and thank God President Trump has essentially bent them over a barrel and they're now preventing some of this cartel violence, some of the human trafficking from getting into the United States.
[02:23:24.444 --> 02:23:32.513]  But there's a special report that I'd like to air on this very subject if the control room can go ahead and bring that up whenever you're able to.
[02:23:33.942 --> 02:23:37.104]  It is the first ever global agreement on migration.
[02:23:37.805 --> 02:23:43.369]  And even if the document is purely symbolic, for the United Nations, its adoption is historic.
[02:23:43.529 --> 02:23:53.596]  We are on the eve of a truly remarkable moment in the pursuit of the better management of international migration, a singular issue of our time.
[02:23:54.016 --> 02:24:02.945]  There are communities fighting back against becoming dumping grounds for the Cloward and Piven-style United Nations-engineered replacement migration of sovereign nations.
[02:24:03.145 --> 02:24:07.209]  However, finding their message on mainstream media is a fleeting reality.
[02:24:07.369 --> 02:24:15.497]  In fact, a quick search of protests against immigration leads you to pro-immigration protesters against the agencies keeping our borders safe.
[02:24:15.711 --> 02:24:22.698]  You're looking at a protest on 5th Avenue in New York organized by the Close the Camps NYC coalition.
[02:24:23.118 --> 02:24:24.880]  The message from Microsoft?
[02:24:25.160 --> 02:24:28.563]  Stop using your technology to facilitate the U.S.
[02:24:28.603 --> 02:24:29.685]  immigration policy.
[02:24:30.265 --> 02:24:39.194]  Immigrations and Customs Enforcement opened up classrooms, the dining hall where families get three meals a day, a library with internet and legal resources.
[02:24:39.634 --> 02:24:44.859]  So they can see exactly the care and the conditions under which these individuals are being kept.
[02:24:44.879 --> 02:24:48.402]  There's a lot of ugly rhetoric that is out there with regard to my agency.
[02:25:05.081 --> 02:25:28.418]  And DHS as a whole, to include CBP, and with regard to the people that are enforcing the laws that Congress has passed, and calling us names and vilifying us for doing the jobs that we are sworn to do, that Congress appropriates $7 billion a year to this agency to effectuate.
[02:25:31.460 --> 02:25:32.040]  It's not right.
[02:25:33.401 --> 02:25:34.022]  It's not fair.
[02:25:35.086 --> 02:25:36.187]  And frankly, it's not helpful.
[02:25:36.287 --> 02:25:42.692]  What if we truly aren't safe in our communities due to the policies of the left as they kowtow for the United Nations?
[02:25:42.852 --> 02:25:48.376]  Wouldn't these protesters simply be supporting unchecked violence against legal residents?
[02:25:48.557 --> 02:25:58.945]  Are they not aiding and abetting the thousands of quietly reported cases and unreported cases of rape and murder waged against innocent and unsuspecting people by illegal aliens?
[02:25:59.165 --> 02:26:04.209]  Instead, the left would have our Second Amendment destroyed and the borders flung wide open.
[02:26:04.309 --> 02:26:04.749]  Hell yes!
[02:26:04.849 --> 02:26:06.611]  We're gonna take your AR-15, your AK-47.
[02:26:06.631 --> 02:26:15.597]  We're not gonna allow it to be used against fellow Americans anymore.
[02:26:15.657 --> 02:26:19.820]  For example, from 2011 until 2017, there were 367 killed by mass shootings in the United States.
[02:26:20.100 --> 02:26:27.565]  While a 2017 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety reveals that from June 1st, 2011 to February 28th, 2017, the 215,000 criminal aliens who were booked into Texas jails
[02:26:34.210 --> 02:26:34.690]  We're good to go.
[02:26:34.730 --> 02:26:34.951]  I think?
[02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:14.836]  I've lived out here in Montgomery County all my life, and now, as you can see, Montgomery County has become a sanctuary for rapists, child rapists.
[02:27:15.537 --> 02:27:24.542]  These children come here to escape that type of terror, and it's happening right here, and we are enabling it.
[02:27:24.662 --> 02:27:29.945]  What is Montgomery County and the county executive with this executive order, what do you believe they're doing wrong?
[02:27:30.305 --> 02:27:34.168]  I believe that they're endangering every single citizen in this county.
[02:27:34.208 --> 02:27:34.548]  How so?
[02:27:34.928 --> 02:27:43.675]  Because they are actively obstructing local, state, and federal cooperation on fundamental matters of public safety and national security.
[02:27:43.935 --> 02:27:53.742]  We should have learned after 9-11 that it is key that we have walls that come down on communicating the immigrant status of criminal suspects in custody.
[02:27:54.082 --> 02:27:58.283]  And this order is the most radical sanctuary order in America.
[02:27:58.563 --> 02:28:00.504]  And this county is ground zero for that.
[02:28:00.724 --> 02:28:02.004]  Let's get some facts on the table.
[02:28:02.044 --> 02:28:03.625]  You mentioned that I'm from Germantown.
[02:28:04.065 --> 02:28:09.106]  Two of the victims of illegal alien criminal rape suspects were from Germantown.
[02:28:09.227 --> 02:28:18.409]  One was a 16-year-old girl who was taking a nap in her own home when a home invader who had been previously deported broke into her home and allegedly killed her.
[02:28:21.124 --> 02:28:30.411]  Completely, no exaggeration, pretty much a Vietnam level of death that happens every single year in Mexico.
[02:28:30.431 --> 02:28:33.673]  30,000 people die.
[02:28:35.154 --> 02:28:42.059]  That could come to the United States and by the way, it's a little bit more dead than from a assault rifle.
[02:28:43.099 --> 02:28:45.641]  That terrible AR-15, the AK-47.
[02:28:45.841 --> 02:28:47.923]  So scary looking, those guns.
[02:28:47.943 --> 02:28:49.444]  You know what's scary?
[02:28:50.421 --> 02:28:56.151]  There's illegal immigrants coming here to sell drugs, rape us, kill us, torture us, mutilate us, and everything that comes with it.
[02:28:57.053 --> 02:28:58.335]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:58.655 --> 02:29:01.039]  We'll be right back after this short break.
[02:29:02.341 --> 02:29:02.821]  Attention!
[02:29:03.422 --> 02:29:15.912]  We started InfoWars Live seven years ago, and now we've got more than 60 products, and I've done a pretty good job rolling most of them out, but one place I haven't is Happy's Mood and Stress.
[02:29:16.112 --> 02:29:24.960]  The system knows that what Mother Nature has given us works way better than what the toxic Big Pharma has been trying to push the population.
[02:29:25.801 --> 02:29:28.343]  That's why the FDA and others work so hard
[02:29:29.485 --> 02:29:40.171]  To keep the knowledge from the people that just walking in the hills or the mountains or by a river for even a few hours a week has been shown in hundreds of conclusive studies.
[02:29:41.041 --> 02:29:45.642]  To boost your mood, to boost your spirit, and to be good for you physically.
[02:29:46.462 --> 02:29:48.243]  The Japanese do this thousands of years ago.
[02:29:48.843 --> 02:29:50.283]  It's called forest bathing.
[02:29:50.543 --> 02:30:00.526]  So there's something you can do that's basically absolutely free, or the amount of energy it'll take you to ride your bike to the forest, or the amount of gas it'll take you to drive your truck when you go out to the beach.
[02:30:01.479 --> 02:30:09.186]  But that said, Happys has become, on average, about our fifth best-selling product with no promotion.
[02:30:10.067 --> 02:30:14.350]  And it's got hundreds and hundreds of five stars because people are blown away by it.
[02:30:14.891 --> 02:30:22.538]  You see, it's got cold-pressed, known herbs that different cultures around the world have used for thousands of years.
[02:30:23.661 --> 02:30:24.983]  Let me read over some of this for you.
[02:30:39.125 --> 02:30:40.986]  For 50% off right now.
[02:30:41.407 --> 02:30:42.447]  For store dot com.
[02:30:42.608 --> 02:30:44.269]  Because I want you to experience it.
[02:30:44.389 --> 02:30:47.571]  And also it spurs people to buy the products when we massively discount.
[02:30:47.911 --> 02:30:49.833]  So we've got to sell a lot of products to fund our operation.
[02:30:49.893 --> 02:30:50.813]  We discount it like this.
[02:30:51.233 --> 02:30:52.855]  But still, overall, it's working out.
[02:30:53.295 --> 02:30:58.979]  Whatever you do, have a passion driven, have a purpose driven life and support InfoWars.
[02:30:58.999 --> 02:31:00.120]  So get your happy today.
[02:31:00.140 --> 02:31:01.180]  50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:09.517 --> 02:31:12.319]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:31:12.519 --> 02:31:22.705]  If you're going to have one of these digital surveillance binders, then you need to go to MFulwarestore.com, where we have branded to our own systems, very inexpensive, lead-lined pockets.
[02:31:22.966 --> 02:31:26.248]  And depending on the cell phone, these have about a 98% resistance rate.
[02:31:26.308 --> 02:31:30.290]  The bigger packs we sell at MFulwarestore.com, MFulware's privacy pouches.
[02:31:31.131 --> 02:31:36.434]  We have these bigger ones, and this is what I like to use when I'm on a trip or traveling so they don't track me as easy.
[02:31:36.494 --> 02:31:37.675]  And believe me, they do.
[02:31:39.420 --> 02:31:45.283]  I mean, I've had folks break into my room, do physical stuff, and I don't try to make a big deal about it, I'm a man.
[02:31:45.643 --> 02:31:51.726]  But I mean, when I travel, I definitely put the wireless equipment, any iPads, any phones, in here.
[02:31:51.886 --> 02:31:57.108]  And this larger unit has around 100% blocket rate, and you just put everything in there and you keep it like that.
[02:31:57.488 --> 02:32:00.050]  We've got them and also have the satchels and have the straps on them.
[02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:07.156]  But just whatever you do, you understand they're reporting on you, they're tracking you, they're listening to you at all times when they have the radio connection to it.
[02:32:07.236 --> 02:32:18.905]  It's recording and compressing packets that are more advanced level than blurping them back to the cell tower or through other wireless devices in your house that are slurping it up and in many cases transferring it down power lines.
[02:32:19.205 --> 02:32:19.565]  That's right.
[02:32:19.605 --> 02:32:20.826]  Information down Powerline.
[02:32:20.906 --> 02:32:21.526]  That's in place.
[02:32:21.706 --> 02:32:25.848]  And so, I just suggest you go to Infowarshore.com and get the e-tracker pouch.
[02:32:26.148 --> 02:32:29.310]  And that's just something so you start thinking about how it tracks you.
[02:32:29.330 --> 02:32:32.651]  Because I'll go for a few weeks using this, then I'll forget and then stop doing it.
[02:32:32.831 --> 02:32:33.091]  Why?
[02:32:33.111 --> 02:32:34.672]  I mean, they've got private eyes following me.
[02:32:34.692 --> 02:32:36.573]  They've got the New York Times, Washington Post following me.
[02:32:36.653 --> 02:32:40.715]  They've had people try to set me up to do things I won't say on air for a lot of reasons, obviously.
[02:32:40.755 --> 02:32:41.435]  So I'm just telling you.
[02:32:41.935 --> 02:32:45.856]  This is an example of what I'm talking about just to get you and your children, your wife, your husband thinking.
[02:32:45.976 --> 02:32:49.137]  And remember, InfoWarshore.com for t-shirts, books, films, the best supplements.
[02:32:49.197 --> 02:32:50.777]  Without your funding, we'll be defeated.
[02:32:50.958 --> 02:32:53.098]  With your support, we're all unstoppable together.
[02:32:53.118 --> 02:33:00.880]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:33:04.921 --> 02:33:10.843]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:19.704 --> 02:33:24.682]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.277 --> 02:33:31.620]  Welcome back to this third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:34.302]  I'm Tom Pappert sitting in for Alex today.
[02:33:34.322 --> 02:33:52.138]  He will be back tomorrow and we will have Mike Adams of Natural News hosting the fourth hour of the broadcast, but let's turn our attention to really just as big of an enemy of the American people as the mainstream media, and that would of course be big tech.
[02:33:52.859 --> 02:34:03.829]  Anybody who watches Alex Jones frequently, or at all, knows that most of these companies are hedging their bets, not just hedging their bets, they're putting all the chips in China.
[02:34:04.649 --> 02:34:10.014]  China is the new power according to Facebook, Google, Twitter, all of them.
[02:34:11.335 --> 02:34:16.360]  And now, we finally have a few allies in the United States Senate,
[02:34:17.449 --> 02:34:18.330]  You understand this.
[02:34:18.370 --> 02:34:31.241]  Senator Josh Hawley is rather upset that Google, Uber, the big tech giants are dropping all of their money in Communist China.
[02:34:31.742 --> 02:34:34.064]  We've got a clip of Senator Hawley.
[02:34:34.464 --> 02:34:36.045]  Let's go ahead and air that clip 13, I believe.
[02:34:38.479 --> 02:34:42.400]  My concern is that what we're seeing with Silicon Valley is they're creating jobs.
[02:34:42.480 --> 02:34:43.600]  They're creating jobs in China.
[02:34:43.761 --> 02:34:45.601]  I mean, where are they prioritizing their investment?
[02:34:45.661 --> 02:34:46.221]  Overseas.
[02:34:46.581 --> 02:34:47.762]  I mean, look at Google.
[02:34:47.902 --> 02:35:00.465]  Google has worked overtime to try and open business ventures in China, including being willing to launch platform search engines that censor according to Chinese Communist government standards, just so that they can rake in the bucks.
[02:35:00.505 --> 02:35:02.746]  Where's everything produced that Apple, for instance, makes?
[02:35:02.866 --> 02:35:03.206]  China.
[02:35:03.826 --> 02:35:06.347]  So I'm concerned that they're building an economy.
[02:35:06.647 --> 02:35:09.648]  Do you think gig economy jobs make America a better or worse place?
[02:35:33.558 --> 02:35:34.659]  I mean, it just depends.
[02:35:35.099 --> 02:35:38.301]  They should be making America better, and this is my challenge to these companies.
[02:35:38.361 --> 02:35:42.823]  My challenge is, if they want to be leaders, you know, they say they represent the best of America.
[02:35:42.884 --> 02:35:45.425]  Well, if that's true, create jobs in this country.
[02:35:45.785 --> 02:35:51.929]  If that's true, invest in the middle of our society, in the middle of the country, but in the American middle, the middle class.
[02:35:52.029 --> 02:35:57.272]  Invest here, produce things here, create jobs and opportunities for our families, increase productivity.
[02:35:57.772 --> 02:35:58.733]  They haven't been doing any of that.
[02:35:59.941 --> 02:36:02.343]  Senator Hawley is really on to something there.
[02:36:02.403 --> 02:36:09.649]  I mean, these companies... And look, if you want to be a sadist or a sociopath, you can make the same calculation.
[02:36:09.689 --> 02:36:16.335]  You can look at 350 million people in America, plus, you know, 30, 40, 50 million illegal immigrants, I'm sure.
[02:36:16.995 --> 02:36:19.998]  You can look at that compared to billions and billions of Chinese.
[02:36:20.378 --> 02:36:22.520]  You can look at the fact that they have no labor laws.
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:24.582]  You chain your child up.
[02:36:25.242 --> 02:36:26.463]  Like we would chain up a bike.
[02:36:26.544 --> 02:36:28.065]  You chain your child up downstairs.
[02:36:28.125 --> 02:36:32.730]  If somebody tries to commit suicide because of the working conditions, the suicide net will catch them.
[02:36:33.131 --> 02:36:37.916]  There is no escaping the Orwellian Chinese social credit system.
[02:36:37.976 --> 02:36:40.359]  So you know your workers are going to be high quality.
[02:36:41.397 --> 02:36:50.921]  Meanwhile, you look over here in America, where we have unions, we have rights, we have freedoms, we have the ability to actually demand something from our employers.
[02:36:50.941 --> 02:36:52.221]  So what's the solution to this?
[02:36:52.261 --> 02:37:10.548]  Well, as Bush, Clinton, Obama, all of the previous presidents, more or less, for the past half century, if not longer, have realized, well, just outsource all the jobs to China, and we'll buy their stuff, and we will become enslaved to the Chinese Communist
[02:37:12.065 --> 02:37:12.726]  Infrastructure.
[02:37:14.047 --> 02:37:14.828]  That's the future.
[02:37:15.548 --> 02:37:24.256]  And you know, I take a lot of Ubers when I come here to Austin to visit the Infowars studios, and it never fails.
[02:37:24.316 --> 02:37:35.827]  These are people who are telling me, yeah, you know, I used to have a factory job, and well now I'm trying to get my real estate license, and I'm just driving an Uber to put food on the table until I can get that done, and then hopefully I can have a real job again.
[02:37:37.022 --> 02:37:42.466]  Because until Trump came about, there were no jobs in this country for normal human beings.
[02:37:42.966 --> 02:37:59.919]  You know, the whole Learn to Code movement, which you can now get banned for on Twitter, that whole movement came about because when coal miners, when factory workers, when the people who represent the majority of middle class America, when their jobs were exported to China,
[02:38:01.854 --> 02:38:04.376]  What were they told by the liberal media?
[02:38:04.477 --> 02:38:05.257]  Just learn to code.
[02:38:05.678 --> 02:38:06.278]  Learn a new skill.
[02:38:06.298 --> 02:38:08.540]  It's a changing economy and you gotta find a place.
[02:38:09.702 --> 02:38:16.728]  So I'm glad that we finally have Josh Hawley in Congress pushing back against this, but I really want to stress that this is
[02:38:18.649 --> 02:38:20.750]  You might as well have elected Alex Jones to Congress.
[02:38:20.990 --> 02:38:23.351]  I say that in a very, very positive way.
[02:38:23.371 --> 02:38:34.457]  Because Alex was in the halls of Congress just over a year ago, shouting at Sundar Pichai, shouting at these big tech overlords, saying exactly, almost verbatim,
[02:38:35.199 --> 02:38:36.640]  What Senator Hawley was saying right there.
[02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:51.491]  So seeing things like this make me optimistic for the future and optimistic that through Congress, through the Trump administration, through the FCC, the FTC, we might start to get some movement against big tech.
[02:38:51.511 --> 02:38:54.133]  Because as we said earlier, it's very clear
[02:38:55.151 --> 02:38:56.532]  What side these people are on?
[02:38:56.592 --> 02:39:00.854]  Facebook has pages for the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda.
[02:39:01.214 --> 02:39:09.038]  Twitter won't allow Laura Loomer on there, won't allow Alex Jones on there, won't allow hardly any InfoWars programming.
[02:39:09.058 --> 02:39:10.978]  You have to be very subversive about it.
[02:39:11.058 --> 02:39:16.861]  Owen Schroyer is constantly banned and shadow banned and they end his videos earlier, they run them without audio.
[02:39:17.261 --> 02:39:22.424]  They're doing anything they can to game the system against patriots, but
[02:39:23.706 --> 02:39:26.076]  Oh, well they let Hamas have a Twitter.
[02:39:26.157 --> 02:39:27.442]  Hamas definitely gets a Twitter.
[02:39:28.297 --> 02:39:29.838]  It's very clear what side these people are on.
[02:39:29.858 --> 02:39:31.819]  They're on the side of anti-America.
[02:39:31.839 --> 02:39:41.065]  You know, I used to joke that we used to watch certain broadcast outlets, Al Jazeera, Russia Today, and they're fairly honest because you just know that they're being anti-American.
[02:39:41.085 --> 02:39:42.545]  And so that's their perspective.
[02:39:42.966 --> 02:39:47.649]  But now we're to the point where Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all of them have the same exact bias.
[02:39:48.089 --> 02:39:49.550]  They want to see America fail.
[02:39:50.050 --> 02:39:51.491]  They want to have our nice houses.
[02:39:51.911 --> 02:39:54.713]  They want to have the freedoms that the rest of us do not get.
[02:39:55.540 --> 02:39:58.462]  But they want America to fail.
[02:39:58.823 --> 02:40:02.405]  I think that's completely obvious at this point.
[02:40:02.465 --> 02:40:04.507]  So I want to change gears here.
[02:40:06.068 --> 02:40:10.672]  Many will remember last week news broke about a horrific discovery.
[02:40:11.766 --> 02:40:13.287]  In South Bend, Indiana.
[02:40:13.327 --> 02:40:17.790]  Say, that's where Pete Boot-Edge-Edge lives, I believe.
[02:40:18.411 --> 02:40:19.171]  Or is it Butt-Guy?
[02:40:19.191 --> 02:40:19.972]  I always get it confused.
[02:40:20.532 --> 02:40:21.453]  That's where Pete lives.
[02:40:21.513 --> 02:40:22.113]  Mayor Pete.
[02:40:22.874 --> 02:40:31.820]  Everyone will remember that a stash of over 2,000 aborted babies was discovered in a deceased former abortionist's home.
[02:40:33.161 --> 02:40:37.464]  And now, a new report up on my site, NationalFile.com.
[02:40:38.905 --> 02:40:45.489]  According to the Whole Women's Health Alliance, they say that these type of stashes exist nationwide.
[02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:53.554]  They said what happens in South Bend is a microcosm for what's happening statewide and what's happening nationally.
[02:40:55.275 --> 02:41:01.059]  So I guess if they can't sell the body parts, they just hold on to them for keepsakes.
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:07.163]  What type of sadistic, fallen human being
[02:41:09.224 --> 02:41:10.224]  Would do such a thing.
[02:41:10.284 --> 02:41:16.926]  It really does make you wonder, but in the article that was just on screen, Mayor Pete has said nothing about this.
[02:41:18.487 --> 02:41:25.309]  2,000 dead babies discovered in his hometown, where by the way, they hate him now.
[02:41:25.909 --> 02:41:27.550]  Black Lives Matter protests against him.
[02:41:27.570 --> 02:41:29.871]  The man has lost all popularity in his hometown.
[02:41:30.211 --> 02:41:30.971]  Mayor Pete.
[02:41:32.537 --> 02:41:33.497]  Pete has said nothing.
[02:41:34.177 --> 02:41:43.380]  After the discovery of over 2,200 preserved babies were found in the residence of the deceased Dr. Ulrich Klopfer in South Bend, Indiana, all eyes turned to their mayor.
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:54.043]  South Bend, Indiana mayor and Democrat presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has proactively avoided making comments on anything concerning abortion laws.
[02:41:55.044 --> 02:41:58.925]  I don't understand how these people can possibly be taken seriously at this point.
[02:41:59.687 --> 02:42:00.687]  But again, they aren't.
[02:42:01.188 --> 02:42:02.368]  That's why it's The Clown Show.
[02:42:02.828 --> 02:42:12.693]  That's why they're desperately hoping that Elizabeth Warren, with Bernie Sanders' ideas, can somehow push forward and become the candidate for 2020.
[02:42:12.853 --> 02:42:15.994]  And of course, Big Tech will help her along the way.
[02:42:16.495 --> 02:42:20.776]  I just want to remind everybody, there are some insanely good deals going on at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:42:53.158 --> 02:42:56.844]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:42:57.124 --> 02:42:58.506]  We'll be right back after this.
[02:42:58.807 --> 02:42:59.648]  I'm Tom Pampert.
[02:42:59.668 --> 02:43:01.131]  You're watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:09.164 --> 02:43:11.925]  The most banned network in the world.
[02:43:12.085 --> 02:43:17.906]  The brand new Super Silver Skin Cream at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:18.046 --> 02:43:19.306]  Two different sizes.
[02:43:19.506 --> 02:43:21.707]  Check it out for yourself, the ingredients.
[02:43:21.827 --> 02:43:24.108]  Research it for yourself and you will find out why.
[02:43:24.268 --> 02:43:30.369]  The crew here and the people behind this are so excited about Super Silver Skin Cream at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:43:30.549 --> 02:43:31.830]  It's all thanks to this audience.

[02:43:33.050 --> 02:43:34.091]  I cannot salute you enough.

[02:43:58.106 --> 02:44:02.209]  Now we've got multiple options, the grapefruit, the lavender scent, or unscented.

[02:44:32.588 --> 02:44:35.470]  You gotta get the new Info Wars Protein Bars.
[02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:37.171]  Cause they are bomb.
[02:44:37.291 --> 02:44:40.293]  This one right here is the Peanut Butter Chocolate Bar.
[02:44:40.433 --> 02:44:43.415]  And I have been staring at it the entire broadcast.
[02:44:43.455 --> 02:44:45.096]  Cause these things are so good.
[02:44:45.196 --> 02:44:47.898]  Yes, I am gonna eat this on air.
[02:44:48.338 --> 02:44:52.501]  These bars, I didn't expect them to be this good when I got them in the mail.
[02:44:52.521 --> 02:44:54.302]  I thought, oh, okay, protein bars.
[02:44:54.322 --> 02:44:55.723]  I've had protein bars here and there.
[02:44:55.823 --> 02:44:57.584]  But these things are amazing.
[02:44:57.604 --> 02:44:59.926]  This seriously is so good.
[02:45:00.506 --> 02:45:01.987]  Like, it tastes like
[02:45:03.964 --> 02:45:05.628]  I don't know.
[02:45:13.234 --> 02:45:17.715]  I'll just eat these instead of a meal, you know, and then go like go running or go work out.
[02:45:17.935 --> 02:45:21.536]  And if you want to support InfoWars, this is a great way to do it.
[02:45:21.776 --> 02:45:23.837]  I mean, and they taste amazing too.
[02:45:24.317 --> 02:45:25.737]  I mean, they're so good.
[02:45:25.917 --> 02:45:30.679]  Like it's got peanut butter on the outside here and chocolate brownie.
[02:45:32.119 --> 02:45:32.659]  So good.
[02:45:32.939 --> 02:45:34.059]  So, so good.
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:36.680]  I absolutely love peanut butter chocolate.
[02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:39.761]  We also have a vanilla coconut one as well.
[02:45:40.601 --> 02:45:41.802]  And that one's really good.
[02:45:42.423 --> 02:45:44.764]  It's actually got real pieces of coconut in it.
[02:45:45.325 --> 02:45:46.346]  It's so good.
[02:45:46.466 --> 02:45:50.069]  I mean, Alex only has the best supplements and the best products.
[02:45:50.269 --> 02:45:55.853]  And what's crazy is, you know, some people aren't really that into supplements or pills or whatever.
[02:45:56.073 --> 02:46:00.977]  I really get a lot out of the supplements, especially the X2 and the Super Female Vitality.
[02:46:01.157 --> 02:46:03.940]  And some of the fish oils are really good as well.
[02:46:03.960 --> 02:46:04.020]  But
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:07.982]  If you're not really even that into the supplements, these things are great.
[02:46:08.022 --> 02:46:09.583]  They're a great snack item.
[02:46:09.603 --> 02:46:17.227]  They're a great thing to keep in your bag if you're busy and you can't do lunch that day or if maybe you're trying to diet or something.
[02:46:17.347 --> 02:46:20.949]  I mean, it's got tons of protein in it and it's just seriously so good.
[02:46:20.989 --> 02:46:21.249]  It's like...
[02:46:21.869 --> 02:46:22.690]  It's like a dessert.
[02:46:23.551 --> 02:46:24.191]  It's really good.
[02:46:24.511 --> 02:46:27.934]  Only 240 calories, 15 grams of protein.
[02:46:28.035 --> 02:46:30.076]  It has whey protein inside of it.
[02:46:30.156 --> 02:46:32.298]  It's really good and it tastes like a candy.
[02:46:32.338 --> 02:46:37.883]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com to help support InfoWars and Alex Jones and me.
[02:46:38.664 --> 02:46:46.971]  Make it so that we can continue to do the news, report the news and go out and cover these events and you can do it while enjoying a super tasty treat.
[02:46:47.512 --> 02:46:53.777]  This is probably one of the best protein bars I've ever had and I've had a lot of different protein bars so I definitely recommend it.
[02:47:05.259 --> 02:47:09.362]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:09.863 --> 02:47:11.164]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:47:21.988 --> 02:47:24.870]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:25.150 --> 02:47:27.011]  I'm Tom Pappert filling in for Alex today.
[02:47:27.031 --> 02:47:29.913]  In the next hour, we've got MikeAdamsNaturalNews.com.
[02:47:29.953 --> 02:47:37.458]  We've got a stack of news and clips that I want to get through in this final segment of the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:37.498 --> 02:47:40.020]  And thank you all so much for tuning in today.
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:44.823]  But this is, it would be funny if this was some type of parody, but it's real life.
[02:47:45.304 --> 02:47:51.628]  Cheerleaders punished for displaying Trump 2020 Make America Great Again banner.
[02:47:52.389 --> 02:47:56.075]  It's up at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:47:56.095 --> 02:47:58.700]  That link isn't quite as shadowbanned as InfoWars.
[02:47:58.780 --> 02:48:00.563]  I can say that as a fact on social media.
[02:48:00.863 --> 02:48:02.466]  Can we go ahead and air this clip?
[02:48:02.586 --> 02:48:04.490]  Because this is, uh, this is pathetic.
[02:48:05.936 --> 02:48:11.260]  Their cheers are meant to unite the crowd, but now at North Stanley High School, the crowd is split.
[02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:17.524]  This after the school's cheerleaders posed with the Trump 2020 banner before a home football game this August.
[02:48:17.945 --> 02:48:34.917]  In a statement to NBC Charlotte, the Stanley County Board of Education said because the cheerleaders were in uniform and were acting as representatives of the school, the display of the sign could be perceived as the school or school system endorsing a political campaign, which they say is prohibited.
[02:48:35.177 --> 02:48:39.639]  The school district says the girls were not disciplined, simply asked not to do it again.
[02:48:39.659 --> 02:48:59.748]  But days later, the North Carolina High School Athletic Association placed the cheerleading spot on probation, telling the local newspaper that every contest should be conducted in a wholesome athletic environment, an environment where good sportsmanship is shown, where people feel safe, that respect for all people participating is being shown.
[02:48:59.908 --> 02:49:04.370]  And while some are cheering on that decision, others cheering on the cheerleaders.
[02:49:04.670 --> 02:49:09.252]  We're only here to support them and their First Amendment rights.
[02:49:09.693 --> 02:49:15.256]  Jeremy Onitrab says he's organizing a support rally in front of the school before Friday night's football game.
[02:49:15.616 --> 02:49:19.158]  So far, more than 800 people say they're interested in attending.
[02:49:19.398 --> 02:49:29.943]  I'd love to line the street so that everybody going into the game goes through the biggest Trump rally they've ever been to.
[02:49:29.983 --> 02:49:31.084]  That would be phenomenal.
[02:49:31.969 --> 02:49:34.050]  So, supporting President Trump.
[02:49:34.390 --> 02:49:36.531]  It might make people feel unsafe.
[02:49:37.671 --> 02:49:39.392]  It could feel unsafe, President Trump.
[02:49:39.492 --> 02:49:40.613]  Orange Van Bad!
[02:49:40.913 --> 02:49:41.933]  Orange Van Scary!
[02:49:42.453 --> 02:49:43.414]  These poor teenagers.
[02:49:43.914 --> 02:49:46.915]  You know, I have a feeling that if it were any other candidate, you would not be having this.
[02:49:46.955 --> 02:49:50.197]  Especially if it was for President Obama during the Obama years.
[02:49:50.257 --> 02:49:52.978]  But you know, who exactly are these girls?
[02:49:53.858 --> 02:49:54.659]  Is it Joe Biden?
[02:49:54.819 --> 02:49:56.599]  Should they be supporting Creepy Sleepy?
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:57.580]  Uncle Joe?
[02:49:58.291 --> 02:49:59.032]  We've got a clip.
[02:49:59.433 --> 02:50:01.255]  Joe Biden, he got to give it to him.
[02:50:01.295 --> 02:50:05.180]  The man is great with math and he has a vision for this country's future.
[02:50:05.260 --> 02:50:11.147]  He's going to get more women back in the workforce than exist in the United States of America.
[02:50:11.168 --> 02:50:12.149]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:50:14.548 --> 02:50:23.014]  You get a tax break for a racehorse, why in God's name couldn't we provide an $8,000 tax credit for everybody who has child care costs?
[02:50:23.374 --> 02:50:30.278]  It would put 720 million women back in the workforce.
[02:50:30.999 --> 02:50:35.662]  It would increase the GDP, to sound like a wonk here, by about 8 tenths of 1%.
[02:50:35.982 --> 02:50:37.223]  It would grow the economy.
[02:50:38.649 --> 02:50:40.850]  To sound like a wonk, he says.
[02:50:40.970 --> 02:50:42.011]  I'm sorry, Joe.
[02:50:42.051 --> 02:50:43.992]  You don't sound like a policy wonk to me.
[02:50:44.332 --> 02:50:45.412]  He's very sad.
[02:50:45.913 --> 02:50:46.793]  Honestly, it's very sad.
[02:50:46.813 --> 02:50:47.713]  I don't like Joe Biden.
[02:50:47.733 --> 02:50:51.455]  I would never vote for the man in a million years, but he used to be savvy.
[02:50:51.695 --> 02:50:57.238]  Y'all know that he used to want to ban raves, and he used to kind of have a cadence to the way he talked, and he was very on the ball.
[02:50:57.278 --> 02:50:57.778]  No longer.
[02:50:58.059 --> 02:50:58.499]  No longer.
[02:50:59.492 --> 02:51:04.795]  Such a strange, strange situation we're in with this creepy, sleepy old guy.
[02:51:04.815 --> 02:51:07.357]  720 million women in the United States of America.
[02:51:07.377 --> 02:51:16.042]  For those playing at home, yes, America has a population of like 325 million people, plus 60 million illegals, so that is mathematically impossible.
[02:51:17.025 --> 02:51:20.967]  Thanks Joe for, I guess, I don't know, where are we going to get 300 million women?
[02:51:21.067 --> 02:51:23.288]  I'm not asking questions anymore.
[02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:24.089]  It's the Clown Show.
[02:51:24.549 --> 02:51:30.372]  So this is a story that's been out for a couple days, but it bears repeating because we need to hold these people accountable.
[02:51:31.413 --> 02:51:38.377]  Ilian Omar, the Democrat representative for Minnesota, she tweeted out in 2013 a Father's Day tweet.
[02:51:40.776 --> 02:51:45.179]  That allegedly, purportedly, proves she married her brother.
[02:51:45.199 --> 02:51:47.280]  This is, of course, the biggest scandal that she has.
[02:51:47.340 --> 02:51:55.786]  She allegedly married her own flesh and blood for the purpose of skirting United States immigration laws.
[02:51:56.126 --> 02:51:57.767]  Meaning it was a sham marriage.
[02:51:57.807 --> 02:51:59.368]  I hope it was just a sham marriage.
[02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:06.313]  In a now-deleted 2013 tweet, Representative Ilhan Omar wished a happy Father's Day to her abo, Nur Saeed.
[02:52:06.753 --> 02:52:09.315]  Which would mean her true name is Ilhan Nur Saeed.
[02:52:09.475 --> 02:52:10.296]  The same surname.
[02:52:11.056 --> 02:52:13.818]  Yes, her ex-husband, who allegedly is her brother.
[02:52:14.579 --> 02:52:24.126]  She's faced increasing scrutiny over what some say was allegedly a sham marriage to skirt United States immigration policy to help her brother, Ahmed Nur Sayyid, gain U.S.
[02:52:24.286 --> 02:52:24.807]  citizenship.
[02:52:25.847 --> 02:52:30.771]  Many consider the Father's Day tweet to be proof that she lied about her identity.
[02:52:30.811 --> 02:52:31.592]  Here's what it said.
[02:52:32.072 --> 02:52:34.534]  We can put it on screen, perhaps with a document cam.
[02:52:34.574 --> 02:52:38.057]  Happy Father's Day to my abo Nur Sayyid.
[02:52:38.177 --> 02:52:39.518]  I am forever grateful to Allah.
[02:52:39.758 --> 02:52:41.100]  For giving me the best father.
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:44.224]  And it actually links to a deleted Instagram post.
[02:52:44.645 --> 02:52:46.527]  Because of course she scrubbed her Instagram.
[02:52:46.547 --> 02:52:50.272]  Apparently she didn't quite catch that they were up on Twitter.
[02:52:50.312 --> 02:52:53.457]  So, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, if anyone
[02:52:54.440 --> 02:52:57.201]  Enter into a sham marriage for the purpose of evading U.S.
[02:52:57.241 --> 02:52:57.961]  immigration law.
[02:52:58.001 --> 02:53:04.243]  It is a felony offense carrying a prison sentence of up to four years and a fine of up to $250,000.
[02:53:04.423 --> 02:53:08.164]  It applies to both foreign nationals and U.S.
[02:53:08.204 --> 02:53:10.645]  citizens who perpetrate the crime.
[02:53:12.073 --> 02:53:14.434]  You know, it does make you wonder, is anybody investigating this?
[02:53:14.554 --> 02:53:16.355]  Is it ever going to be taken seriously?
[02:53:16.375 --> 02:53:18.637]  Or are we going the way of the UK?
[02:53:19.037 --> 02:53:21.258]  Which is an absolute mess when it comes to this type of thing.
[02:53:21.278 --> 02:53:23.920]  This is another article up at nationalfile.com.
[02:53:24.520 --> 02:53:30.603]  UK rejects ban on eating dogs to avoid offending foreign culture.
[02:53:31.344 --> 02:53:38.328]  So if you don't eat Toto from Kansas, what can I say, then you are offending
[02:53:39.298 --> 02:53:40.100]  Foreign cultures!
[02:53:40.882 --> 02:53:46.996]  UK Justice Ministry has blocked a ban on eating cats and dogs over fear it may offend Far East Asians.
[02:53:47.708 --> 02:53:51.390]  This is, by the way, the time of year that horrifying things happen in China.
[02:53:51.410 --> 02:53:52.011]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[02:53:52.271 --> 02:53:54.092]  I guess maybe I think my culture is the best.
[02:53:54.553 --> 02:53:56.254]  I think that we should put America first.
[02:53:56.294 --> 02:53:59.396]  But in China, they're currently blowtorching dogs to eat them.
[02:53:59.756 --> 02:54:01.217]  That's just the time of year.
[02:54:01.517 --> 02:54:02.198]  Just the time of year.
[02:54:02.558 --> 02:54:11.344]  The UK's politically correct authorities come under fire on a regular basis for their devotion to progressive ideals of inclusivity, even if there are significant negative consequences.
[02:54:11.384 --> 02:54:16.127]  And now, environmental ministers have drafted a proposal that will prohibit the practice
[02:54:17.398 --> 02:54:19.039]  But, it's been stopped.
[02:54:21.841 --> 02:54:22.301]  Oh my.
[02:54:23.442 --> 02:54:24.703]  Dogs are our companion animals.
[02:54:24.743 --> 02:54:25.503]  We do not eat them.
[02:54:26.324 --> 02:54:34.309]  But then they say, Justice Official also argued that it would be difficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.
[02:54:35.209 --> 02:54:37.771]  So I guess you can pick up a dog at the pound and just eat it.
[02:54:39.090 --> 02:54:41.492]  Now we think things are bad here in the U.S.
[02:54:41.532 --> 02:54:46.155]  where we have Antifa saying that we need to put Trump supporters in death camps.
[02:54:46.675 --> 02:54:52.579]  That came out a couple weeks ago and it's still, I don't know why I was surprised, of course that's what they think, but it still bothers me.
[02:54:53.339 --> 02:55:01.705]  We have Democrat Ito Robert Francis O'Rourke saying hell yeah we're gonna take your guns but
[02:55:03.183 --> 02:55:05.244]  Peto isn't saying that we all have to die.
[02:55:05.264 --> 02:55:09.426]  He's not saying that we should be killed, but that's exactly what's happening across the pond.
[02:55:10.006 --> 02:55:14.428]  UK Liberal Democrat says Conservatives should be burned at the stake.
[02:55:15.128 --> 02:55:19.270]  Conservatives should also be hung, drawn and quartered, according to Galen Milne.
[02:55:20.130 --> 02:55:28.174]  Prospective parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats, Galen Milne, has been dropped after he said that Tories should be burned at the stake.
[02:55:29.042 --> 02:55:34.324]  He also described conservative MPs as Tory rats who rear their ugly heads.
[02:55:35.564 --> 02:55:36.345]  This is coming here.
[02:55:36.365 --> 02:55:42.667]  You know, a lot of people say Britain is just between six months and three years ahead of the United States, and I think we're getting there.
[02:55:43.007 --> 02:55:43.988]  I think we're getting there.
[02:55:45.468 --> 02:55:50.290]  Here's a horrifying article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:50.830 --> 02:55:52.231]  STEM Express whistleblower.
[02:55:52.671 --> 02:55:55.312]  Cut open baby's face to harvest the brain.
[02:55:57.142 --> 02:56:00.526]  They're killing, they're keeping babies alive and selling their body parts.
[02:56:00.987 --> 02:56:14.084]  Ladies and gentlemen, testimonies delivered by pro-life activist David DeLeden, who secretly recorded abortion workers, revealed some of the gruesome details surrounding body-harvesting procedures carried out by Planned Parenthood and STEM Express.
[02:56:15.307 --> 02:56:19.090]  Cutting open their brains and selling them.
[02:56:20.231 --> 02:56:21.012]  That's so horrifying.
[02:56:21.052 --> 02:56:24.055]  I don't even... It's not something you can even say easily.
[02:56:24.896 --> 02:56:25.977]  But there is some good news.
[02:56:26.297 --> 02:56:29.159]  I always like to leave folks with a bit of good news.
[02:56:29.740 --> 02:56:34.444]  The number of abortions in the United States has now fallen to its lowest since 1973.
[02:56:35.085 --> 02:56:38.468]  That's according to the Associated Press.
[02:56:40.026 --> 02:56:45.031]  We're finally getting somewhere in the culture war, which of course goes well before politics.
[02:56:46.913 --> 02:56:51.779]  It was only at 862,000, which is far, far too many, but that's down from 926,000 tallied in 2014.
[02:56:51.819 --> 02:56:52.880]  There is some progress, after all.
[02:57:00.396 --> 02:57:05.779]  So I just want to, one more time, stress that everybody goes to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:06.180 --> 02:57:07.340]  Fund this broadcast.
[02:57:07.620 --> 02:57:13.684]  These are some of the best deals I've seen this year, if not in the last five years, of following Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[02:57:14.565 --> 02:57:16.506]  I don't know how Alex does this.
[02:57:16.526 --> 02:57:16.826]  75% off.
[02:57:19.503 --> 02:57:20.744]  Major, major products.
[02:57:21.264 --> 02:57:23.846]  So I am Tom Pappert of National File.
[02:57:24.667 --> 02:57:28.810]  Catch me tonight, Firepower News, at 7 o'clock central.
[02:57:28.830 --> 02:57:29.711]  We go until 9.
[02:57:29.791 --> 02:57:31.312]  Myself and Will Johnson.
[02:57:31.332 --> 02:57:32.933]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[02:57:33.273 --> 02:57:38.457]  Coming up next is Mike Adams of Natural News, taking over for the fourth hour.
[02:57:38.477 --> 02:57:41.259]  He's always a massive wealth of information.
[02:57:41.599 --> 02:57:43.581]  So thank you for watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:43.981 --> 02:57:44.802]  Stay tuned!
[02:57:45.422 --> 02:57:49.334]  Mike Adams coming up next right here on InfoWars.
[02:57:58.055 --> 02:58:01.198]  I don't have to tell this audience that you're amazing.
[02:58:01.338 --> 02:58:14.369]  Without you, Infowars would not have been here to relaunch Americana in the last decade, and to relaunch Americana as a challenge to the globalist narrative of a godless, anti-human, anti-family world government.
[02:58:14.489 --> 02:58:16.551]  But I do need to remind you that you are.
[02:58:16.991 --> 02:58:17.491]  You're the engine.
[02:58:17.891 --> 02:58:18.872]  You're the wind in our sails.
[02:58:18.952 --> 02:58:22.273]  You are the blood in the veins and arteries of this operation.
[02:58:22.433 --> 02:58:23.733]  You're the eyes and ears on the ground.
[02:58:24.153 --> 02:58:26.554]  You are the soul of the resistance to tyranny.
[02:58:26.774 --> 02:58:27.474]  And I know you're humble.
[02:58:27.754 --> 02:58:33.896]  I know you're just the salt of the earth people all across this country and all across this world of every race, color, and creed who bleed red blood and love God and love justice.
[02:58:34.116 --> 02:58:45.099]  And I'm here to tell you, your word of mouth spreading the fact that InfoWars is still on the air, person to person, via email, via text message, via Facebook, Twitter, and all the major enemy sites has changed the world and it's going to change the world again.
[02:58:45.160 --> 02:58:46.680]  They want InfoWars out of the fight.
[02:58:46.880 --> 02:58:49.862]  They want us to give up and roll over and crawl into a hole and die.
[02:58:49.982 --> 02:58:50.682]  We're not going to do it.
[02:58:50.782 --> 02:58:54.404]  We're continuing fighting on because now more than ever, we are vindicated.
[02:58:54.564 --> 02:59:02.088]  Those of you that have spread the word about the New World Order, about the private Federal Reserve, about the pedophile rigs that run the planet, about the Satanism in its operating system, you've done it all.
[02:59:02.128 --> 02:59:04.469]  You exposed the fluoride given as cancer in Lord RRQ's.
[02:59:04.730 --> 02:59:06.731]  You exposed the GMO, the glyphosate.
[02:59:06.751 --> 02:59:07.491]  You've all been
[02:59:07.671 --> 02:59:10.713]  You exposed the drag queen story time as pedo time.
[02:59:10.814 --> 02:59:17.058]  You exposed the fact that radical Islam is orthodox Islam, that the globalists are funding it to tear down what's left of the Christian West.
[02:59:17.379 --> 02:59:20.461]  You are the reason we're here today, all of us together.
[02:59:20.621 --> 02:59:21.542]  You are the InfoWire.
[02:59:21.882 --> 02:59:24.124]  That's a literal statement, that's not figurative.
[02:59:24.684 --> 02:59:30.169]  And so, without you spreading the word, financially supporting the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen, we're not going to be here.
[02:59:30.609 --> 02:59:35.753]  So again, I commend you, I salute you, and I want to remind you, InfoWireStore.com to get great products and fund this operation.
[02:59:56.544 --> 02:59:58.645]  You are receiving this transmission.
[02:59:58.725 --> 03:00:02.826]  You are the resistance.
[03:00:05.346 --> 03:00:09.428]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:00:09.928 --> 03:00:13.909]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:00:19.148 --> 03:00:24.051]  Hello and welcome to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:24.071 --> 03:00:27.594]  This is Mike Adams from Natural News stepping in for this whole hour today.
[03:00:27.614 --> 03:00:40.422]  We've got a lot coming up for you here covering some science bombshells that are the biggest, you could say, science red flags that they are trying to destroy our biosphere and annihilate humanity.
[03:00:41.283 --> 03:00:42.463]  We've got new breaking news on that.
[03:00:42.503 --> 03:00:47.727]  Number one, the GMO mosquito experiment in Brazil has failed catastrophically.
[03:00:48.266 --> 03:00:58.414]  And it has now unleashed super mutant GMO mosquitoes that could kill millions of people throughout South America, Central America, and even in the United States eventually.
[03:00:59.395 --> 03:01:06.741]  And this has caused genetic pollution of the mosquito population, combining the genes from three different countries into one mosquito population.
[03:01:06.901 --> 03:01:08.742]  It is an absolute catastrophe.
[03:01:09.103 --> 03:01:12.926]  It's exactly the type of genetic pollution that we have been warning about for many years.
[03:01:13.965 --> 03:01:16.434]  In fact, I remember on InfoWars in 2012, seven years ago,
[03:01:19.483 --> 03:01:25.845]  I was talking about this very issue with a Save Our Science type of warning at that time.
[03:01:25.905 --> 03:01:28.206]  That was in 2012 and here it is happening today.
[03:01:28.426 --> 03:01:32.287]  But that's just one story of three big bombshell stories I have for you today.
[03:01:32.307 --> 03:01:44.752]  The other one is about the global geoengineering slash chemtrails program that's being funded in part by Bill Gates and being run by a Harvard scientist to pollute the entire planet's atmosphere.
[03:01:45.632 --> 03:01:48.693]  This is a stratospheric aerosol injection or
[03:01:49.452 --> 03:01:56.937]  As the Bill Gates funding is promoting another program called SCOPEX, which stands for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment.
[03:01:57.318 --> 03:02:03.762]  This is designed to pollute the entire planet, shut down photosynthesis, collapse the food supplies globally.
[03:02:04.343 --> 03:02:16.151]  And in today's broadcast here on InfoWars, I'm going to go over the ramifications of that and why, just honestly, truthfully, if you don't have a one-year plan to survive without groceries,
[03:02:18.083 --> 03:02:22.864]  You're gonna be killed by this because the global food supply will collapse.
[03:02:22.884 --> 03:02:24.525]  That's what this program is trying to achieve.
[03:02:24.825 --> 03:02:25.905]  And it's now out in the open.
[03:02:25.965 --> 03:02:29.046]  CNBC just released a big video on this a couple of days ago.
[03:02:29.986 --> 03:02:31.426]  And they're touting the benefits of it.
[03:02:31.466 --> 03:02:34.807]  Basically, chemtrails are now being supported by the mainstream media.
[03:02:35.127 --> 03:02:38.588]  The same media that three years ago said it was a conspiracy theory.
[03:02:38.908 --> 03:02:41.429]  Now it's mainstream, you know, CNBC.
[03:02:42.316 --> 03:02:43.037]  Saying it's awesome.
[03:02:44.278 --> 03:02:44.818]  It's incredible.
[03:02:45.138 --> 03:02:45.379]  All right.
[03:02:45.619 --> 03:02:46.720]  And that's just the second story.
[03:02:47.020 --> 03:02:53.125]  The third story I have for you today is about the evil tech giants and how they're trying to literally suck your blood.
[03:02:53.505 --> 03:02:57.428]  Now, they're doing this through medical testing innovation.
[03:02:57.748 --> 03:03:02.252]  I'm going to talk about the now defunct company Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes.
[03:03:02.796 --> 03:03:09.642]  And how it was actually a plot to harvest the blood and the DNA of every American in your own home.
[03:03:10.142 --> 03:03:29.918]  And then to upload the DNA scans to a central database that would be used, of course, by the deep state, the swamp, the federal government, the NSA, to profile you genetically and to tie you to crimes that you didn't commit because you might share genes with some hair follicle that was left behind or a piece of skin left behind by some other criminal.
[03:03:31.159 --> 03:03:31.640]  It's insane.
[03:03:32.222 --> 03:03:33.003]  But they want your blood.
[03:03:33.163 --> 03:03:34.023]  They're out for your blood.
[03:03:34.383 --> 03:03:36.465]  It's not just the blood of children, as you well know.
[03:03:36.925 --> 03:03:43.168]  Not just infanticide and abortions and all that insanity and how they're just mass killing children in the name of women's health.
[03:03:43.589 --> 03:03:47.231]  They want your blood so they can track you and they can enslave you.
[03:03:47.811 --> 03:03:52.534]  So we've got those three stories coming up here in this hour here on the Alex Jones.
[03:03:53.442 --> 03:03:55.344]  Alex is traveling, of course, right now.
[03:03:55.965 --> 03:03:59.128]  I was told that he's arriving soon in Austin.
[03:03:59.449 --> 03:04:04.294]  I think he'll be on the air tomorrow, maybe tonight, maybe he'll pop in during the last part of this hour.
[03:04:04.355 --> 03:04:04.595]  We'll see.
[03:04:05.575 --> 03:04:08.837]  But Alex, of course, he released this information in a podcast yesterday.
[03:04:08.877 --> 03:04:10.198]  He was on with Joe Rogan.
[03:04:10.538 --> 03:04:14.260]  I think a five hour interview that'll probably be edited to a shorter version.
[03:04:14.780 --> 03:04:17.642]  But Alex sees the same thing that I see about what's happening.
[03:04:17.742 --> 03:04:24.986]  This is the the an escalation of global events to try to destroy humanity.
[03:04:25.306 --> 03:04:28.148]  This is the annihilation of the human race that we are witnessing.
[03:04:28.168 --> 03:04:33.131]  And I hope you talked about that with Joe Rogan, because Joe needs to get the full picture of what's going on.
[03:04:33.671 --> 03:04:34.511]  I'm talking about the
[03:04:36.019 --> 03:04:37.380]  I call it geogenocide.
[03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:52.051]  This is the planned, planet-scale genocide of the human race through multiple vectors, not just the fluoride in the water supply, not just the heavy metals and lead in the water, not just radiation, Fukushima, and all that, not just the vaccines and 5G, but much more.
[03:04:52.312 --> 03:04:56.094]  So we'll get into that here on the Alex Jones Show as we continue with the fourth hour.
[03:04:56.134 --> 03:04:56.535]  Stay with us.
[03:04:56.915 --> 03:04:59.217]  We'll be right back in one minute for all those details.
[03:05:04.229 --> 03:05:07.531]  I've got a message for the scumbag anti-American, Beto O'Rourke.
[03:05:08.391 --> 03:05:12.914]  You're down here thinking you can tame Texas and conquer us and destroy us like California.
[03:05:13.234 --> 03:05:16.596]  You think you can turn us into your disarmed slaves?
[03:05:17.396 --> 03:05:21.719]  Beto O'Rourke, you're well known for fantasizing and writing essays about murdering children.
[03:05:21.999 --> 03:05:24.881]  And you even got away with a hit and run, burglary.
[03:05:25.481 --> 03:05:27.083]  You're a dirty criminal.
[03:05:27.524 --> 03:05:31.268]  You've got your own bodyguards because you're hooked into that billionaire wife of yours.
[03:05:31.709 --> 03:05:34.192]  How dare you try to demonize American gun owners?
[03:05:34.593 --> 03:05:39.238]  Just in case you didn't know, this country was founded when the Redcoats came to take the guns in 1775.
[03:05:39.519 --> 03:05:41.421]  That's why we got July 4th.
[03:05:42.262 --> 03:05:46.724]  So I'm going to tell you what George Washington and the Continental Congress told King George III.
[03:05:47.084 --> 03:05:50.945]  You're not getting our firearms because we're free men, you little piece of crap!
[03:05:51.506 --> 03:05:57.588]  America and the world's glad, though, that you finally got the guts to admit your plan with the rest of those scumbag Democrats.
[03:05:58.128 --> 03:06:00.089]  Beto O'Rourke, you're on notice!
[03:06:00.489 --> 03:06:03.030]  You're not getting our firearms, ever, scumbag!
[03:06:12.193 --> 03:06:14.914]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:06:15.454 --> 03:06:21.416]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:06:23.297 --> 03:06:24.797]  Welcome back to the fourth hour.
[03:06:24.837 --> 03:06:28.898]  This is Mike Adams here filling in for Alex Jones, who is traveling today.
[03:06:29.479 --> 03:06:31.159]  But we've got big bombshell news for you here.
[03:06:31.179 --> 03:06:32.039]  Let's start right into it.
[03:06:32.079 --> 03:06:40.122]  Number one, the GMO mosquito experiment that was unleashed in Brazil over the last two years has gone horribly wrong.
[03:06:41.192 --> 03:06:50.959]  It has resulted in the breeding of super mutant mosquitoes that now combine some of the genes of mosquitoes from three different countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Brazil.
[03:06:51.980 --> 03:06:57.064]  And these new super mosquitoes are now coming back with a vengeance because they've been genetically modified.
[03:06:57.084 --> 03:07:02.828]  They've been turned into like mutant, I don't know, maybe you could call them superhero mutant mosquitoes or something.
[03:07:03.509 --> 03:07:05.170]  And they are now stronger than ever.
[03:07:06.198 --> 03:07:13.440]  And they're surging back in population, and they now threaten the lives of millions of people in ways that they've never been threatened before.
[03:07:13.640 --> 03:07:15.000]  This was all part of an experiment.
[03:07:15.120 --> 03:07:16.100]  I mean, let's back up on this.
[03:07:16.220 --> 03:07:26.362]  We were told, the science was, that they were going to release all these males that were genetically modified, and the males were going to be weakened with a dominant infertility gene.
[03:07:26.782 --> 03:07:28.243]  And then they would mate with the females.
[03:07:28.443 --> 03:07:31.283]  And then the females would have offspring that were sterile.
[03:07:31.703 --> 03:07:34.604]  And through this mechanism, we were told, the whole system would collapse.
[03:07:35.666 --> 03:07:36.706]  The mosquitoes would die off.
[03:07:36.826 --> 03:07:38.447]  We wouldn't have these mosquito populations.
[03:07:38.967 --> 03:07:39.947]  This is what we were told.
[03:07:40.947 --> 03:07:42.387]  Well, guess what happened?
[03:07:43.227 --> 03:07:49.629]  As in many of these experiments, in the wild, things happened that they did not anticipate in the laboratory.
[03:07:50.249 --> 03:07:56.690]  So what really happened is, at first, yes, the mosquitoes began to die off for about the first 12 to 18 months.
[03:07:56.950 --> 03:08:01.771]  And this is reported by Yale, and this has been reported in the science journal Nature, by the way.
[03:08:02.717 --> 03:08:04.299]  So the first 18 months they started to die off.
[03:08:04.700 --> 03:08:06.342]  But then something changed.
[03:08:06.742 --> 03:08:11.649]  The females began to stop mating with the weakened males.
[03:08:12.270 --> 03:08:12.991]  You hear me on this?
[03:08:13.091 --> 03:08:16.115]  The females said no, they don't want to reproduce with the weakened males.
[03:08:16.535 --> 03:08:18.358]  And they started selecting males that had
[03:08:19.082 --> 03:08:20.223]  You know, virility.
[03:08:21.003 --> 03:08:22.003]  Males that could have children.
[03:08:22.103 --> 03:08:23.124]  Males that could have offspring.
[03:08:23.584 --> 03:08:27.506]  Gosh, if only liberals in California could be as smart as these mosquitoes, that would be amazing.
[03:08:27.786 --> 03:08:32.208]  But these female mosquitoes then started selecting males that could reproduce.
[03:08:32.508 --> 03:08:34.069]  And then the population surged back.
[03:08:34.089 --> 03:08:40.272]  But during this time, some of the modified genes got transferred over to the population that's in the wild.
[03:08:40.692 --> 03:08:42.013]  And this wasn't supposed to happen.
[03:08:42.033 --> 03:08:44.794]  And in fact, this is what these scientists at Yale
[03:08:45.450 --> 03:08:46.130]  We're good to go.
[03:09:04.818 --> 03:09:19.984]  And so, how many people, I say, how many people are going to die in Brazil from dengue fever or, you know, all these mosquito-borne diseases, you name it, so many of them, how many are going to die because of this science experiment gone wrong?
[03:09:20.825 --> 03:09:23.106]  The number could be huge over the next decade.
[03:09:23.186 --> 03:09:26.727]  It could kill a million or more people because of this experiment, you know, theoretically.
[03:09:27.808 --> 03:09:28.808]  And they can't pull it back.
[03:09:29.821 --> 03:09:31.362]  So we warned about this in 2012.
[03:09:31.442 --> 03:09:37.147]  We warned about the different levels of dangerous science and things that can be unleashed in the wild.
[03:09:37.548 --> 03:09:43.413]  We warned about chemicals being unleashed, like fluoride and so on, and that's one level of danger.
[03:09:43.833 --> 03:09:45.735]  Glyphosate, pesticides, all these things.
[03:09:46.355 --> 03:09:53.962]  But a higher level of danger is what we call self-replicating pollution, genetic pollution, that continues to replicate.
[03:09:54.462 --> 03:09:56.484]  And that's what these scientists have done.
[03:09:57.563 --> 03:10:10.452]  And they forced it on us, and they said their science was perfect, it's gonna work great, they're gonna save lives, they said they're gonna save lives with their twisted science, and they banned us for daring to raise the alarm on this seven years ago, people!
[03:10:11.012 --> 03:10:12.713]  We raised the alarm seven years ago!
[03:10:13.153 --> 03:10:13.654]  And what happened?
[03:10:13.914 --> 03:10:17.356]  We get banned, we get deplatformed, but we were right the whole time.
[03:10:17.736 --> 03:10:20.338]  We were the ones warning humanity about this, and now it's happened.
[03:10:20.758 --> 03:10:23.140]  And, by the way, the experiment hasn't been stopped.
[03:10:24.218 --> 03:10:25.038]  And this is continuing.
[03:10:25.078 --> 03:10:28.499]  I just got a text before the show from a couple that lives out in California.
[03:10:28.939 --> 03:10:30.140]  They might be watching this right now.
[03:10:30.500 --> 03:10:36.662]  They told me that, based on their information, other strains of genetically modified mosquitoes are being released in California.
[03:10:37.082 --> 03:10:39.243]  I haven't confirmed that yet, but that's what they're telling me.
[03:10:39.723 --> 03:10:43.964]  They're already seeing very aggressive mosquito behavior that they didn't notice before.
[03:10:45.064 --> 03:10:50.726]  So, something is being unleashed on purpose as part of a massive depopulation scheme.
[03:10:50.966 --> 03:10:53.887]  Because the end result of this, really, is to kill more humans.
[03:10:54.508 --> 03:10:55.308]  That's what's going on.
[03:10:55.388 --> 03:10:57.229]  They're killing more humans.
[03:10:58.429 --> 03:11:02.410]  And also, just a quick note here about sexual reproduction.
[03:11:03.490 --> 03:11:11.992]  In nature, isn't it interesting that species adapt and overcome, and they engage in sexual reproduction to achieve continuation of the species?
[03:11:12.592 --> 03:11:21.554]  And even in mosquitoes, they do not, the females, do not want to reproduce with the weakened, feminized, pathetic males.
[03:11:22.518 --> 03:11:31.086]  And yet, in our pop culture today, especially on the West Coast, in, you know, liberal California, you see feminization of the males.
[03:11:31.126 --> 03:11:32.588]  You see the push for transgenderism.
[03:11:32.628 --> 03:11:36.171]  You see the push for the mutilation of the genitalia of children.
[03:11:37.192 --> 03:11:39.655]  You see this push for extinction!
[03:11:40.876 --> 03:11:44.417]  And in the wild, you see survival, adaptation.
[03:11:44.857 --> 03:11:47.557]  The animals are smarter than the progressives in California.
[03:11:47.617 --> 03:11:50.958]  The insects are smarter than the progressives in California.
[03:11:51.198 --> 03:11:53.218]  The insects choose life.
[03:11:53.798 --> 03:12:00.640]  The progressives in California choose suicide and death and infanticide and abortion and just self-destruction.
[03:12:01.640 --> 03:12:03.860]  I find that interesting at many levels.
[03:12:04.661 --> 03:12:04.901]  All right.
[03:12:06.561 --> 03:12:07.081]  Next story.
[03:12:07.734 --> 03:12:11.935]  But, you know, it'll be interesting to see if these GMO mosquitoes continue to be released all around the world.
[03:12:12.155 --> 03:12:18.976]  And if they are, you know it's a depopulation program because the science is already out that it doesn't work to reduce mosquitoes.
[03:12:19.216 --> 03:12:20.976]  So that can't be the plan anymore.
[03:12:21.476 --> 03:12:22.977]  The Yale scientists have already proven it.
[03:12:22.997 --> 03:12:24.437]  They did the DNA analysis.
[03:12:25.117 --> 03:12:27.097]  So it's all about depopulation of humans.
[03:12:27.377 --> 03:12:32.798]  It's all about breeding a weaponized strain of mosquitoes in order to kill human beings.
[03:12:33.478 --> 03:12:37.379]  And that's consistent with everything else that we've been seeing about killing human beings.
[03:12:38.246 --> 03:12:40.988]  And with that note, let's go to geoengineering.
[03:12:42.048 --> 03:12:43.129]  Now, I did a story yesterday.
[03:12:43.429 --> 03:12:44.089]  This was interesting.
[03:12:44.670 --> 03:12:48.011]  Now, you're probably already aware because you're a super-informed audience.
[03:12:48.071 --> 03:12:51.193]  You know more than anybody that watches the mainstream media.
[03:12:51.914 --> 03:12:56.696]  You know that Bill Gates has been funding this global pollution scheme called SCOPEX.
[03:12:57.016 --> 03:13:00.318]  It's the SCOPEX Project, Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment.
[03:13:01.059 --> 03:13:03.320]  And this is with Harvard scientists, by the way.
[03:13:03.580 --> 03:13:05.181]  And their plan is to pollute the skies.
[03:13:06.297 --> 03:13:16.646]  They want to block the sun, this is their plan, to reflect sunlight back into space, so to deprive plants on Earth the sunlight that they need in order to function as plants.
[03:13:16.726 --> 03:13:22.071]  This is about shutting down photosynthesis, which is the basis of all sustainable life on our planet.
[03:13:22.551 --> 03:13:26.475]  And there you go, if you're watching, it shows the airplanes releasing pollution into the stratosphere.
[03:13:27.115 --> 03:13:32.340]  And this pollution will consist of sulfur dioxide and calcium carbonate, which is contaminated with lead.
[03:13:33.143 --> 03:13:39.626]  What it means is that they're going to drop lead and pollution all across the entire planet in the stratosphere.
[03:13:40.866 --> 03:13:43.087]  They're going to lead poison the entire planet.
[03:13:43.807 --> 03:13:51.851]  Now lead, according to a study in the Lancet that we covered last week, kills in America 412,000 Americans every year.
[03:13:52.431 --> 03:13:52.731]  Lead!
[03:13:53.091 --> 03:13:55.192]  We're talking low-level lead contamination.
[03:13:55.452 --> 03:13:59.454]  And by the way, the mechanism of that death is through heart disease and ischemic heart disease.
[03:14:00.054 --> 03:14:02.095]  So lead causes heart failure.
[03:14:03.112 --> 03:14:05.093]  And low-level lead contamination causes that.
[03:14:05.113 --> 03:14:07.653]  That's why it's important to get, you know, clean supplements.
[03:14:07.854 --> 03:14:10.014]  That's why I know Infant Wars tests are supplements.
[03:14:10.114 --> 03:14:14.035]  And, you know, I do testing for lots of companies, including I've tested a lot of Infant Wars supplements.
[03:14:14.336 --> 03:14:15.276]  You've got to get rid of the lead.
[03:14:15.296 --> 03:14:16.236]  You've got to have clean stuff.
[03:14:16.716 --> 03:14:20.017]  Because if you're exposed to lead, you're going to die of heart disease.
[03:14:20.037 --> 03:14:21.158]  412,000 Americans do every year.
[03:14:21.618 --> 03:14:22.118]  It's incredible.
[03:14:23.266 --> 03:14:26.467]  Now, Bill Gates wants to put lead into the skies all around the planet.
[03:14:26.927 --> 03:14:29.468]  Calcium carbonate is always contaminated with lead.
[03:14:29.748 --> 03:14:30.508]  We've done the testing.
[03:14:30.868 --> 03:14:33.309]  We know how much lead is in calcium carbonate.
[03:14:33.909 --> 03:14:36.570]  Now, the media will lie to you and say, no, it's just chalk.
[03:14:36.710 --> 03:14:38.651]  Well, all chalk is contaminated with lead.
[03:14:39.371 --> 03:14:40.591]  So that's a fact that you can count on.
[03:14:40.631 --> 03:14:43.132]  We've done the tests, ICP-MS, mass spectrometry.
[03:14:43.352 --> 03:14:44.232]  We know this information.
[03:14:44.892 --> 03:14:49.894]  Now, this is about shutting down, shutting down the biosphere.
[03:14:50.675 --> 03:15:07.876]  So it's not just about releasing GMO mosquitoes that are going to be super mutant mosquitoes that kill millions of people, especially in third world countries, which is where Bernie Sanders sort of hinted that he might support enhanced abortion, right, for impoverished nations filled with black and brown people.
[03:15:08.316 --> 03:15:09.498]  That's where they're pushing the
[03:15:10.111 --> 03:15:20.923]  The GMO mosquitoes in Brazil, and that's where they were pushing the infertility chemicals of the food supply in the 1970s with science advisor Dr. Lee DuBridge, advisor to President Richard Nixon.
[03:15:20.943 --> 03:15:24.827]  They wanted to export food with abortion chemicals in the food.
[03:15:25.147 --> 03:15:32.115]  And today, to this very day, they have abortion chemicals, HCG, in the vaccines being given to women in Kenya.
[03:15:32.839 --> 03:15:39.943]  So as usual, the globalists are targeting Africa, Central America, South America, but with the new Project Scopex, they're targeting us all.
[03:15:40.283 --> 03:15:46.806]  And we'll talk about that in much more detail as we come back, including details about why you can't opt out of it.
[03:15:47.427 --> 03:15:49.087]  You can opt out of vaccines for now.
[03:15:49.628 --> 03:15:55.351]  You can say no to vaccines, but you can't say no to Bill Gates and Harvard scientists polluting the entire planet.
[03:15:56.091 --> 03:15:57.352]  And they don't want you to be able to say no.
[03:15:57.452 --> 03:15:58.632]  Much more straight ahead.
[03:15:58.873 --> 03:15:59.433]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:02.298 --> 03:16:05.619]  Hi, I'm Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News and Action 7 News.
[03:16:05.659 --> 03:16:06.699]  We're here in Hong Kong.

[03:16:54.476 --> 03:17:02.660]  You have gone to Infowarsstore.com and gotten books and films, supplements and t-shirts, and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need!
[03:17:07.763 --> 03:17:09.024]  We gotta fund this operation.
[03:17:10.124 --> 03:17:12.746]  I came in this morning and
[03:17:15.674 --> 03:17:19.016]  He said, hey, everybody, what's a great Beto counter shirt?
[03:17:19.236 --> 03:17:20.376]  Like, from our cold, dead hands?
[03:17:20.396 --> 03:17:22.517]  I was like, well, how about from his cold, dead hands?
[03:17:22.537 --> 03:17:24.498]  Well, I don't want to threaten him, but that's what's going to happen.
[03:17:24.518 --> 03:17:26.019]  You know, they try to pick the guns of Civil War.
[03:17:26.039 --> 03:17:26.859]  I mean, how do you do it?
[03:17:27.039 --> 03:17:32.482]  He's got a shirt out he's selling saying, hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s and all your other semi-autos.
[03:17:32.622 --> 03:17:38.164]  Well, one of my old friends, the guy that did security work for us, he called up this morning and said, we're in the middle of the show.
[03:17:38.304 --> 03:17:39.405]  He said, I just came up with this design.
[03:17:39.545 --> 03:17:41.306]  He said, how about Beto not?
[03:17:41.626 --> 03:17:42.226]  Beto not.
[03:17:43.086 --> 03:17:47.449]  It's a M4, AR-15, a Texas Star above it, but it's an Army Star or whatever you like.
[03:17:47.529 --> 03:17:48.670]  And then, Bateau Knot.
[03:17:48.690 --> 03:17:50.612]  These are being printed, already being printed.
[03:17:50.632 --> 03:17:52.253]  And on the back, oh, they already have it in Army Green.
[03:17:52.273 --> 03:17:52.953]  Go down there and click below.
[03:17:52.973 --> 03:17:53.814]  I guess they already did what I said.
[03:17:53.914 --> 03:17:56.155]  On the back, it says M4Wars.com.
[03:17:56.315 --> 03:17:57.736]  So, we've already got it in gray.
[03:17:57.756 --> 03:17:59.417]  We've already got it in Army Green.
[03:17:59.437 --> 03:18:00.598]  We've got it in darker gray.
[03:18:00.918 --> 03:18:02.459]  And this needs to be a best-seller.
[03:18:02.660 --> 03:18:05.842]  Exercise your First Amendment in defense of the second or lose it.
[03:18:05.982 --> 03:18:08.303]  And it's a win-win because you're funding this operation.
[03:18:12.486 --> 03:18:13.727]  That's your support.
[03:18:13.767 --> 03:18:15.247]  Plus, you get great products you already need.
[03:18:16.007 --> 03:18:16.908]  Take action today.
[03:18:17.368 --> 03:18:19.909]  You know, they came out and were banning the Betsy Ross flag.
[03:18:20.129 --> 03:18:20.849]  We sold 10,000 of them.
[03:18:20.909 --> 03:18:22.130]  And that sounds like a lot of money.
[03:18:22.170 --> 03:18:24.391]  It's not to run this operation, but to put a lot of the shirts on the streets.
[03:18:24.451 --> 03:18:24.811]  That's great.
[03:18:24.851 --> 03:18:25.111]  Thank you.
[03:18:25.171 --> 03:18:28.212]  We sold 7,000 of the Space Force shirt that spreads the word.
[03:18:28.252 --> 03:18:29.493]  It's a nice, comfortable, cool shirt.
[03:18:29.673 --> 03:18:29.913]  Fun.
[03:18:29.993 --> 03:18:34.035]  We sold 100,000 of the Hillary for Prison shirts, but I sold half of them at $5 it cost.
[03:18:34.055 --> 03:18:35.815]  These shirts cost more because they're nicer fabric.
[03:18:35.835 --> 03:18:37.096]  Space Force shirts are like $12.
[03:18:37.276 --> 03:18:38.577]  The XXL is even more.
[03:18:38.737 --> 03:18:40.857]  So, these are designer shirts that'd be $25, $35 in stores.
[03:18:42.318 --> 03:18:42.498]  I just
[03:19:01.264 --> 03:19:09.488]  It's not like we're just one of the programs out there fighting them.
[03:19:09.508 --> 03:19:11.009]  We're the one that's got their number.
[03:19:11.149 --> 03:19:12.910]  They don't like our spirit.
[03:19:12.970 --> 03:19:15.052]  Because believe me, it's the opposite of Satanism.
[03:19:15.332 --> 03:19:21.936]  And it may come off as aggressive and a little hateful sometimes, because it's, you know, that's the Holy Spirit shining through my dirty earth suit.
[03:19:23.240 --> 03:19:23.740]  And you know what?
[03:19:23.760 --> 03:19:30.085]  The truth is, at least out of the Bible and history, most people God used to go after evil were not a bunch of candy asses.
[03:19:30.345 --> 03:19:32.727]  We're not up there all telling you how holy they were all day long.
[03:19:34.528 --> 03:19:37.511]  So I'm not just up here to put on some sweetsy act for people.
[03:19:38.711 --> 03:19:39.892]  Because I don't have the energy to do it.
[03:19:41.413 --> 03:19:42.234]  I can't be fake.
[03:19:42.614 --> 03:19:43.495]  I just don't have it in me.
[03:19:45.126 --> 03:19:48.827]  In fact, if anything, I just hold back just how really pissed off I am.
[03:19:48.847 --> 03:19:50.087]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:19:50.507 --> 03:19:53.508]  If you're not angry about what's happening, there's something wrong with you.
[03:19:53.868 --> 03:19:55.148]  And I know you're pissed.
[03:19:55.548 --> 03:20:01.790]  Let's put that anger into action.
[03:20:04.751 --> 03:20:10.652]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:22.781 --> 03:20:27.765]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:28.366 --> 03:20:31.708]  And now, your host, Mike Adams.
[03:20:34.711 --> 03:20:36.392]  We're back with the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:36.432 --> 03:20:37.453]  Thanks for continuing with us.
[03:20:37.473 --> 03:20:39.815]  The fourth hour here on this bombshell day.
[03:20:39.875 --> 03:20:40.696]  So much news today.
[03:20:41.585 --> 03:20:50.253]  Alex is coming back to Austin after traveling and he may be popping in this hour or certainly later with a special report.
[03:20:50.293 --> 03:20:51.574]  So we'll see if he pops in.
[03:20:51.594 --> 03:20:52.334]  I know he's aware.
[03:20:52.495 --> 03:20:56.958]  Alex is fully aware of the annihilation of humanity that is taking place.
[03:20:57.459 --> 03:21:00.241]  It's not, you know, we've covered all these things over the years.
[03:21:00.261 --> 03:21:03.284]  The fluoride, the 5G assaults, the psychiatric drugging of children.
[03:21:03.883 --> 03:21:13.848]  The abortion and the infanticide, the murder, everything, now it just gets bigger and bigger on a more global scale and there are more vectors trying to depopulate humanity, just kill off all humans.
[03:21:14.528 --> 03:21:15.809]  This is what the globalists are trying to do.
[03:21:16.309 --> 03:21:21.432]  So as I sort of got into in the last segment, but I'll go into more detail here, the geoengineering experiments are now
[03:21:21.932 --> 03:21:45.568]  Openly admitted by the mainstream media same media that attacked us years ago said we were conspiracy theorists for talking about chemtrails and geoengineering and weather control and once again Like Alex Jones was 10 years ahead of the media on this and I warned about this stuff seven years ago in 2012 You know, but again, we were censored so that you couldn't know the truth, but now it's all out there So understand that this this chemtrails
[03:21:46.271 --> 03:21:52.536]  This program, Project Scopex, is funded by the biggest globalist organizations that are also involved in censorship.
[03:21:53.057 --> 03:22:03.325]  In particular, when I was watching this CNBC video yesterday that was touting the benefits of chemtrails and geoengineering, they showed the list of donors who are supporting this program.
[03:22:04.226 --> 03:22:11.572]  And the donors, it was 14 nonprofits, and it includes just a long list of them, but one of them is the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.
[03:22:12.332 --> 03:22:15.215]  And that rang a bell, because I remember the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
[03:22:15.965 --> 03:22:26.352]  Was instrumental in getting the vaxxed documentary that told the truth about vaccines, getting it banned from the Tribeca Film Festival.
[03:22:27.212 --> 03:22:28.273]  That was a couple years ago.
[03:22:29.051 --> 03:22:41.057]  But Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has always been about covering up the truth about the science schemes that are trying to kill people and brain damage people and maim people.
[03:22:41.657 --> 03:22:53.523]  And depending on, you know, what information sources you go to, you can find some very interesting history about Alfred P. Sloan and a lot of his globalists who really have decided to try to eliminate the human population.
[03:22:54.608 --> 03:23:05.155]  So what I want to explain here, as a scientist myself, as a published scientist and a lab scientist, I need you to understand what will happen when they dim the sun.
[03:23:05.515 --> 03:23:09.737]  They're trying to block the sun by mimicking a natural disaster volcano.
[03:23:10.538 --> 03:23:12.479]  There was a volcano that erupted in the year 1815.
[03:23:12.619 --> 03:23:15.501]  I forgot the name of it.
[03:23:15.521 --> 03:23:18.563]  It was like Mount Tambora or something similar to that.
[03:23:19.409 --> 03:23:22.890]  And this volcano caused what was called a year without a summer.
[03:23:23.470 --> 03:23:26.911]  It caused food crops to fail around the world.
[03:23:27.552 --> 03:23:30.132]  Food crops failed on at least five continents.
[03:23:30.172 --> 03:23:33.334]  People starved to death all over the world because of one volcano.
[03:23:33.934 --> 03:23:34.154]  Why?
[03:23:34.374 --> 03:23:39.355]  Because that volcano ejected a massive amount of particulate matter into the stratosphere.
[03:23:40.076 --> 03:23:47.018]  And then, of course, the stratosphere, it circulates, it moves around, and so then that spread across the whole planet and it blocked the sun.
[03:23:48.160 --> 03:23:51.881]  Food crops failed, people died, businesses went bankrupt, all over the world.
[03:23:51.921 --> 03:23:52.261]  And that was 1815.
[03:23:52.301 --> 03:24:07.365]  Now, the Scopex Project, funded by Bill Gates and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and others, they're trying to mimic this natural disaster of a volcano through artificial means, by flying planes at high altitude and releasing pollution into the atmosphere.
[03:24:07.925 --> 03:24:12.286]  Understand, the environmentalists are now demanding global pollution.
[03:24:13.166 --> 03:24:15.947]  The environmentalists want to pollute the planet.
[03:24:16.207 --> 03:24:17.707]  This is their demand now.
[03:24:18.696 --> 03:24:26.581]  And if they succeed, they're going to cause, listen carefully, a global collapse of food production.
[03:24:27.442 --> 03:24:33.405]  We are talking about a food collapse that spans all the major continents, you know, at least five continents.
[03:24:34.406 --> 03:24:41.270]  A food collapse that will collapse populations, especially in third world countries where they're on marginal food supplies already.
[03:24:42.191 --> 03:24:45.213]  And even by blocking as little as one or two percent of the sunlight,
[03:24:45.911 --> 03:24:51.673]  They will crush food production in those marginalized areas where plants are just barely surviving as it is.
[03:24:52.713 --> 03:24:55.894]  You don't have to block 50% of the sunlight to collapse world population.
[03:24:55.914 --> 03:24:58.435]  You only have to block a tiny portion of the sunlight.
[03:24:58.655 --> 03:24:59.675]  And this is what they're trying to do.
[03:25:00.756 --> 03:25:03.216]  And they claim it's very affordable to do.
[03:25:03.837 --> 03:25:09.358]  They say they're only going to have to spend $2.5 billion a year for the next 10 or 15 years to achieve this.
[03:25:09.638 --> 03:25:10.399]  And that's nothing.
[03:25:11.099 --> 03:25:13.960]  People like Bill Gates can write a check for $2.5 billion.
[03:25:15.618 --> 03:25:18.080]  I mean, he probably carries that in his pocket.
[03:25:18.120 --> 03:25:18.420]  Who knows?
[03:25:18.800 --> 03:25:21.061]  But these people, to them, this is cheap.
[03:25:21.642 --> 03:25:23.343]  They want to destroy the human population.
[03:25:23.643 --> 03:25:26.445]  The cheapest way for them to accomplish that is to pollute the skies.
[03:25:27.506 --> 03:25:29.827]  The implications of this are enormous.
[03:25:30.587 --> 03:25:32.989]  Way beyond anything that I think they have even imagined.
[03:25:34.030 --> 03:25:36.151]  The collapse of the global food supply means that
[03:25:37.170 --> 03:25:38.530]  You're going to have social unrest.
[03:25:38.570 --> 03:25:41.871]  You're going to have starvation, famine, disease.
[03:25:42.371 --> 03:25:46.032]  Basically, you're going to have the four horsemen of the apocalypse unleashed upon our world.
[03:25:46.532 --> 03:25:49.853]  This is like end times mad science that is going to happen.
[03:25:50.513 --> 03:25:52.053]  And there's no one stopping them.
[03:25:52.773 --> 03:25:56.214]  And the other side of this is that they don't even need a vote.
[03:25:56.594 --> 03:25:59.755]  They don't even need permission from the President or the Senate.
[03:25:59.835 --> 03:26:00.355]  You know why?
[03:26:00.975 --> 03:26:03.616]  Because they can launch these planes from any country in the world.
[03:26:03.816 --> 03:26:05.576]  They don't have to launch them from the United States.
[03:26:06.411 --> 03:26:16.038]  Even if Trump were completely opposed to this, and he may not even be aware of any of this yet, he couldn't stop it because the president has no power outside the United States.
[03:26:16.338 --> 03:26:23.303]  These globalists can get together and they can pay some, you know, third world dictator nation somewhere that has a runway.
[03:26:23.984 --> 03:26:25.825]  They can just launch all these planes from there.
[03:26:26.866 --> 03:26:31.549]  And because it's polluting the entire planet, the entire stratosphere, you can't escape it.
[03:26:32.708 --> 03:26:34.089]  The globalists have figured this out.
[03:26:34.410 --> 03:26:47.381]  You can say no to vaccines, and there's a growing vaccine resistance because of the dangers of vaccines and the toxic ingredients they put in them, like mercury and aluminum and squalene and so on, and aborted human fetal tissue, by the way.
[03:26:48.221 --> 03:26:49.322]  You can escape vaccines.
[03:26:49.803 --> 03:26:53.366]  And they're trying to push the mandates, but the mandates are meeting resistance, even in California.
[03:26:53.986 --> 03:26:57.830]  But you can't escape global pollution of the skies.
[03:26:58.130 --> 03:26:59.311]  There's nothing you can do.
[03:27:00.453 --> 03:27:02.674]  If the sunlight is blocked, sunlight's blocked.
[03:27:03.474 --> 03:27:05.734]  You can't grow your crops like you used to.
[03:27:06.094 --> 03:27:09.095]  And also, by the way, your solar panels don't work like they used to.
[03:27:09.515 --> 03:27:16.537]  So all these globalists that are saying, ah, we have to give up combustion engines, you got to buy solar panels, you have to install solar, everything's got to be solar.
[03:27:16.877 --> 03:27:19.637]  These are the same lunatics that are going to block the sun.
[03:27:20.637 --> 03:27:21.358]  Think about this.
[03:27:21.478 --> 03:27:22.798]  These are the same people.
[03:27:23.058 --> 03:27:27.419]  Like, yeah, invest all your money in solar panels, and then we're going to make sure they don't really work very well.
[03:27:28.493 --> 03:27:31.435]  As if they, I mean, they don't even work very well right now in many cases.
[03:27:32.516 --> 03:27:41.481]  So these people are going to bankrupt, you know, the counties and the cities that have invested all this solar panel expecting a payoff in 15 years or whatever.
[03:27:41.801 --> 03:27:44.163]  That's going to be delayed because the sun's going to be blocked.
[03:27:45.091 --> 03:27:49.755]  And then you're going to have a global food collapse mimicking the natural disaster of this 1815 volcano.
[03:27:49.775 --> 03:27:56.140]  And you're going to have famine, you're going to have geopolitical collapse, you know, economic collapse, social unrest.
[03:27:56.540 --> 03:28:02.585]  Basically, you're looking at a global coordinated collapse of human society as we know it today.
[03:28:03.385 --> 03:28:05.907]  And this is their deliberate plan.
[03:28:06.268 --> 03:28:07.889]  And I call this their hard kill vector.
[03:28:08.109 --> 03:28:09.090]  They tried soft kill.
[03:28:09.550 --> 03:28:11.552]  They tried to put infertility chemicals in the food.
[03:28:12.543 --> 03:28:14.344]  You know, Atrazine is a chemical castrator.
[03:28:14.384 --> 03:28:16.465]  This is what's feminizing many people today.
[03:28:16.646 --> 03:28:17.826]  Atrazine, it's an herbicide.
[03:28:18.247 --> 03:28:21.949]  They tried to put soft-kill chemicals into the vaccines, into the water supply.
[03:28:22.769 --> 03:28:27.893]  They tried soft-kill techniques through multiple methods, psychiatric drugs, cancer drugs, everything.
[03:28:28.593 --> 03:28:32.836]  Now, they're running out of patients, and they've moved to a hard-kill vector.
[03:28:33.116 --> 03:28:35.918]  The hard-kill vector is Pollute the Skies.
[03:28:36.618 --> 03:28:38.139]  In the name of environmentalism,
[03:28:39.195 --> 03:28:40.296]  It's going to cause acid rain.
[03:28:40.316 --> 03:28:45.622]  It's going to cause lead to fall out of the skies and contaminate the entire food supply with lead.
[03:28:45.662 --> 03:28:48.345]  It's going to contaminate the rivers and streams and oceans.
[03:28:49.266 --> 03:28:51.488]  It's going to cause solar panels to be impaired.
[03:28:51.508 --> 03:28:57.494]  It's going to cause a global economic collapse, famine, disease, infestation, basically your zombie apocalypse.
[03:28:57.735 --> 03:28:58.535]  They're bringing it to you.
[03:28:59.436 --> 03:29:00.878]  We'll be back with more details.
[03:29:09.241 --> 03:29:14.143]  If you want to continue to see us on air, I've got to tell you, it's so simple.
[03:29:14.203 --> 03:29:15.304]  Shop with the good guys.
[03:29:15.464 --> 03:29:17.985]  Go to mfullwhorestore.com, especially if you never have.
[03:29:18.145 --> 03:29:23.148]  Get some of the great nootropics we've got that are healthy, good stimulants like Brain Force, Parabo Force, and then Chill Force.
[03:29:23.268 --> 03:29:26.729]  It gives you that awake, but focused, zen-type, awake, chill feeling.
[03:29:26.829 --> 03:29:32.072]  And you can find that combo at mfullwhorestore.com for 50% off with the two together.
[03:29:32.192 --> 03:29:34.513]  And Barnes, I never asked you to do this, but you were chiming in.
[03:29:34.533 --> 03:29:38.375]  You really like our Wake Up America coffee, and you were saying you really like Brain Force.
[03:29:38.675 --> 03:29:41.118]  Oh yeah, so I mean, I've always got the coffee, which is great.
[03:29:41.138 --> 03:29:41.879]  It's fantastic.
[03:29:41.899 --> 03:29:43.260]  Some of the best coffee I've ever had.
[03:29:43.401 --> 03:29:44.382]  That's the reason why I get them.
[03:29:44.442 --> 03:29:45.443]  Bit of a coffee snob.
[03:29:45.543 --> 03:29:48.186]  I've always got the fluoride-free toothpaste, because I like that.
[03:29:48.326 --> 03:29:52.271]  Because I've always had concerns about fluoride, which were recently confirmed in a wide range of studies.
[03:29:52.371 --> 03:29:57.557]  After they were criticizing it for forever, saying there's no worries, no concerns, all of a sudden they're like, well, it actually causes baby defects.
[03:29:57.717 --> 03:30:01.603]  And then I like the protein bars because they're a good sort of intermediate snack.
[03:30:01.683 --> 03:30:09.594]  So when you want something to eat between sort of lunch and dinner or between dinner and a late snack, you don't want it just to be, you know, Little Debbie's or Swiss cake rolls, then protein bars really hit the spot.
[03:30:09.654 --> 03:30:14.201]  But so with the protein bars, I got a free sample of Brain Force and typically I'm not a supplement guy.
[03:30:14.341 --> 03:30:19.685]  Unlike other people, my brain chemistry is such that it's unaffected by most medicines, unaffected by a wide range of things.
[03:30:19.805 --> 03:30:21.166]  So I just generally haven't tried it.
[03:30:21.226 --> 03:30:24.008]  So I got a free sample and I was like, well, what the heck, I'll try it, see if it works.
[03:30:24.128 --> 03:30:28.291]  Because of the nature of my legal work, I have these peak times where I need peak mental activity.
[03:30:28.591 --> 03:30:33.454]  Whether it's doing a trial, whether it's about to be in front of a court hearing, whether it's doing an appellate oral argument.
[03:30:33.474 --> 03:30:34.976]  There are times when you're up for two days.
[03:30:35.176 --> 03:30:35.656]  Oh, exactly.
[03:30:35.696 --> 03:30:40.219]  So I need to be able to, during that time period of when I'm, you know, I used to be able to stay up two days no problem.
[03:30:40.279 --> 03:30:41.240]  You know, didn't blink twice.
[03:30:41.400 --> 03:30:43.901]  No, passing that age threshold, that's not so easy.
[03:30:43.961 --> 03:30:47.623]  So I needed something that when I wake up, I could stay peak and keep at that peak level.
[03:30:47.703 --> 03:30:49.003]  And so I figured, I'll go ahead and try it.
[03:30:49.063 --> 03:30:50.184]  And it turned out to be fantastic.
[03:30:50.344 --> 03:30:52.385]  It's the best product I've ever had in that regard.
[03:30:52.485 --> 03:30:58.667]  In fact, what happened was, I had taken it earlier in the day, and it was around 9 or 10 p.m., I was like, why am I still at sort of peak mental facility?
[03:30:58.707 --> 03:30:59.688]  Because I've been going for 15 hours.
[03:31:00.288 --> 03:31:02.751]  And usually by that point, I started to fatigue, started to drift off.
[03:31:02.831 --> 03:31:06.276]  In fact, I was trying to watch entertainment, my brain was still going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[03:31:06.676 --> 03:31:09.580]  And then I realized, oh, this was the very first time I'd taken BrainForce.
[03:31:09.900 --> 03:31:10.781]  So I was like, this must be it.
[03:31:10.801 --> 03:31:15.407]  So I went and researched all the ingredients, figured out, oh, okay, this makes perfect sense, this combination.
[03:31:15.667 --> 03:31:19.092]  And for whatever reason, no one else out in the marketplace has really combined it in the way you have.
[03:31:19.412 --> 03:31:21.253]  Well, what I did is I went to the top developers.
[03:31:21.273 --> 03:31:22.934]  I had to pay people quite a bit of money for that.
[03:31:22.954 --> 03:31:29.097]  I mean, just our TurboForce, I had to pay $30,000 from the guy, top developer of products.
[03:31:29.177 --> 03:31:33.299]  We said, if somebody would put a lot of money into something, because the other manufacturers won't, what would your dream product be?
[03:31:33.339 --> 03:31:37.041]  And I had to pay the guy, he's famous, I can't say his name, that's in the contract, to make TurboForce.
[03:31:37.161 --> 03:31:39.702]  The best, the strongest, 10-hour energy is really what it is.
[03:31:39.762 --> 03:31:43.184]  And really what they did was, they spliced two best-selling products together.
[03:31:43.864 --> 03:31:45.306]  And so that's why it works so well.
[03:31:45.346 --> 03:31:46.206]  Oh, it's fantastic.
[03:31:46.387 --> 03:31:47.568]  And what's great is the whole model.
[03:31:47.588 --> 03:31:52.612]  The whole model of trying to make it affordable so the large blue-collar part of the audience can also afford it.
[03:31:52.992 --> 03:32:07.485]  It basically, it's a way for people to be healthier, for people to be wealthier because they're getting the same products they would otherwise buy but cheaper, and to be able to change the world at the same time by creating a network that can literally help elect the President of the United States the most powerful country in the world.
[03:32:07.865 --> 03:32:09.867]  Folks, we're in a total war right now.
[03:32:10.367 --> 03:32:16.112]  I mean, we've really gone up and punched the dragon in the nose, and now the real fight's on.
[03:32:16.192 --> 03:32:20.175]  We're doing everything we can here, but it takes products being sold.
[03:32:20.275 --> 03:32:21.856]  That's how we fund our operation.
[03:32:21.897 --> 03:32:23.378]  We've got Ultimate Bone Broth.
[03:32:23.438 --> 03:32:27.061]  It is the strongest, best bone broth from chicken bone broth.
[03:32:27.401 --> 03:32:28.582]  It's super high quality.
[03:32:28.642 --> 03:32:29.442]  It's the best out there.
[03:32:29.522 --> 03:32:30.403]  The best fish oil.
[03:32:30.443 --> 03:32:31.223]  The best turmeric.
[03:32:31.283 --> 03:32:32.564]  The best skin cream.
[03:32:32.724 --> 03:32:34.425]  A lot of really game-changing stuff.
[03:32:34.445 --> 03:32:37.766]  So thanks for the plug, but just sign up for AutoShip on things you're gonna want to reorder.
[03:32:37.906 --> 03:32:41.548]  And then even if something's selling out, we hold back another order of that so you get it.
[03:32:41.748 --> 03:32:43.990]  I've invested over a hundred million dollars.
[03:32:44.130 --> 03:32:47.051]  You have, in the last 15 years in this place, or more.
[03:32:47.371 --> 03:32:48.212]  Hell, it's way more than that.
[03:32:49.045 --> 03:32:49.525]  You understand?
[03:32:50.286 --> 03:32:52.067]  So, you want this to keep living?
[03:32:52.687 --> 03:32:54.028]  Hey, feed me Seymour!
[03:32:54.468 --> 03:32:55.569]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:55.829 --> 03:32:56.869]  I appreciate all of your support.
[03:32:56.889 --> 03:33:02.312]  I got some big specials right now.
[03:33:05.054 --> 03:33:10.977]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:15.393 --> 03:33:16.114]  Big Brother.
[03:33:16.554 --> 03:33:17.775]  Mainstream media.
[03:33:18.436 --> 03:33:19.557]  Government cover-ups.
[03:33:20.098 --> 03:33:21.018]  You want answers?
[03:33:21.599 --> 03:33:22.700]  Well, so does he.
[03:33:23.361 --> 03:33:25.142]  It's Mike Adams!
[03:33:27.685 --> 03:33:31.188]  We are back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.208 --> 03:33:36.333]  Thank you for continuing with us here as we explore the science agenda to annihilate
[03:33:36.813 --> 03:33:37.514]  Humankind.
[03:33:37.594 --> 03:33:39.036]  It's the mad science agenda.
[03:33:39.397 --> 03:33:41.960]  By the way, you know, I'm not an opponent of real science.
[03:33:42.060 --> 03:33:42.921]  I am a scientist.
[03:33:43.221 --> 03:33:44.323]  You know, I do science every day.
[03:33:45.104 --> 03:33:50.691]  Real science, though, needs to be married with humility and what's called the precautionary principle.
[03:33:51.528 --> 03:33:57.850]  Such as, hey, don't release your weaponized mosquitoes, your genetically modified insects, into the wild.
[03:33:58.431 --> 03:33:59.931]  And then, oh, see what happens.
[03:34:00.351 --> 03:34:13.176]  You know, don't pollute the skies globally, block the sun, shut down photosynthesis, collapse all the food crops, just to see what might happen, to see if you might stop your, you know, global warming hoax, which is all fabricated anyway, it's all fiction.
[03:34:13.536 --> 03:34:20.599]  See, I understand the role of science, but these people, these globalists and lunatics, they think science replaces God.
[03:34:21.747 --> 03:34:23.208]  They hate the idea of God.
[03:34:23.268 --> 03:34:25.429]  They hate the idea of spirituality.
[03:34:25.469 --> 03:34:27.290]  And they think that science is their savior.
[03:34:27.310 --> 03:34:28.751]  That's why they're all into transhumanism.
[03:34:29.351 --> 03:34:33.594]  They want to merge with the machines, and they want to use science to dominate society.
[03:34:33.614 --> 03:34:37.196]  And when their mad science experiments go wrong, well, what do they do?
[03:34:37.896 --> 03:34:40.017]  They blame their political opponents.
[03:34:40.057 --> 03:34:50.423]  So, trust me, mark my words on this, when the geoengineering chemtrails experiment goes horrifically wrong, and the food crops are collapsing all over the world, and people are starving to death, you know what they're going to say?
[03:34:51.152 --> 03:34:52.894]  They're going to say, oh, it's because of climate change.
[03:34:53.254 --> 03:34:57.157]  They need to double down the pollution in the skies to block even more sun.
[03:34:57.538 --> 03:34:58.759]  And then it's going to get even worse.
[03:34:59.439 --> 03:35:02.662]  More starvation, more disease, more economic collapse.
[03:35:02.682 --> 03:35:03.743]  And they're going to say the same thing.
[03:35:04.143 --> 03:35:09.628]  It's going to be like AOC is going to come out and say, oh, we've got to put more pollution in the skies again and again and again.
[03:35:10.449 --> 03:35:11.370]  These are lunatics.
[03:35:12.130 --> 03:35:13.392]  These are science lunatics.
[03:35:14.012 --> 03:35:18.356]  They are almost going to win their own Darwin Award.
[03:35:19.150 --> 03:35:21.112]  For stupidity and self-extermination.
[03:35:21.593 --> 03:35:23.615]  The problem is they're going to take you and me with them.
[03:35:24.516 --> 03:35:28.260]  They're going to kill us all if we don't stop them with these mad science experiments.
[03:35:28.881 --> 03:35:33.626]  You don't pollute your planet and call it saving your planet, but that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[03:35:35.548 --> 03:35:41.174]  Now, oh and by the way, you see they roll out these children as puppets all the time like this Greta girl?
[03:35:42.237 --> 03:35:46.760]  They have Greta now lecturing America about fake climate change.
[03:35:46.960 --> 03:35:50.082]  This little girl who has no idea what she's talking about.
[03:35:50.142 --> 03:35:51.162]  She's been handed lines.
[03:35:51.182 --> 03:35:53.404]  She's a puppet of the globalists.
[03:35:53.984 --> 03:35:57.566]  They're lecturing us and lecturing Congress about global warming.
[03:35:57.606 --> 03:35:57.886]  Really?
[03:35:58.827 --> 03:35:59.087]  Really?
[03:35:59.127 --> 03:35:59.928]  What is she in?
[03:36:00.128 --> 03:36:01.509]  The seventh grade or something?
[03:36:01.749 --> 03:36:03.950]  I mean, this is what the globalists are doing now.
[03:36:04.250 --> 03:36:05.511]  They find children.
[03:36:06.252 --> 03:36:12.995]  Like Hogg and Greta, and they just feed them lines, and then they roll out these children as your saviors.
[03:36:13.695 --> 03:36:18.738]  Sarah Silverman, the comedian, didn't she say that this Greta girl is like the second coming of Christ or something?
[03:36:18.938 --> 03:36:19.598]  You see my point?
[03:36:19.958 --> 03:36:29.542]  They hate God, but they say that their fake science is your God, and you're supposed to bow down and worship and praise Greta as the second coming of Christ.
[03:36:29.963 --> 03:36:32.744]  This creepy, just creepy girl,
[03:36:33.542 --> 03:36:46.168]  Like, she should be, well, I'm going to hold back my comments, but she's creepy, and her ideas are creepy, and they're dangerous for our world, and she has zero qualifications to even talk to us about any of this stuff.
[03:36:46.508 --> 03:36:49.470]  But isn't that classic leftism, liberalism?
[03:36:49.890 --> 03:36:51.831]  They talk about things that they don't know about.
[03:36:52.634 --> 03:37:00.396]  Like, they want to lecture you on your AR-15 and how your AR-15 works, and the first thing they say is, like, ban the clips, you know?
[03:37:00.776 --> 03:37:02.137]  Because they're morons!
[03:37:02.157 --> 03:37:05.317]  They don't know anything about what they're even talking about.
[03:37:05.778 --> 03:37:11.519]  They don't know the difference between a semi-automatic and a full-auto or bolt-action or anything.
[03:37:11.539 --> 03:37:17.521]  They have no clue what they're talking about, whether it's science or climate or guns or liberties or even history.
[03:37:17.541 --> 03:37:19.341]  They just fabricate their own history.
[03:37:19.681 --> 03:37:21.962]  They make up anything they want, and then they just pass it off.
[03:37:22.634 --> 03:37:23.554]  That's liberalism.
[03:37:23.895 --> 03:37:25.616]  They have no connection with reality.
[03:37:26.016 --> 03:37:27.957]  But they want to control everything.
[03:37:28.157 --> 03:37:29.257]  They want to dominate your world.
[03:37:29.277 --> 03:37:31.098]  They want to dominate you.
[03:37:33.820 --> 03:37:34.360]  Yeah, who was it?
[03:37:34.400 --> 03:37:38.242]  Which candidate was it that said, you can't have magazines that hold more than one round?
[03:37:38.282 --> 03:37:38.522]  Was that?
[03:37:38.642 --> 03:37:39.442]  That was Biden, I think.
[03:37:40.103 --> 03:37:40.683]  Yes.
[03:37:42.084 --> 03:37:43.684]  Brain scrambled Biden for you there.
[03:37:44.065 --> 03:37:45.545]  Famous AR-15 quotes.
[03:37:46.586 --> 03:37:47.166]  Fascinating stuff.
[03:37:47.406 --> 03:37:48.927]  But getting to the blood harvesting of people.
[03:37:49.699 --> 03:37:56.184]  I did cover this briefly on a previous show here on InfoWars, but there's something new that you need to understand about this.
[03:37:56.965 --> 03:38:05.951]  The Theranos company that was founded by Elizabeth Holmes, which was a massive financial and investment fraud, and she is facing criminal charges now.
[03:38:06.172 --> 03:38:07.533]  The company has been disbanded.
[03:38:07.773 --> 03:38:08.533]  It's all shut down.
[03:38:08.774 --> 03:38:11.876]  I think she burned through $900 million in other people's money.
[03:38:12.657 --> 03:38:18.819]  She, at one point, was celebrated as the most amazing woman, female entrepreneur, worth billions of dollars, going to change the world.
[03:38:19.399 --> 03:38:23.461]  Her entire business model was taking your blood in your own home.
[03:38:23.721 --> 03:38:33.864]  The goal was for her to install these so-called Edison machines in your home, and you were supposed to get up every day and stick your finger in this machine, and it was going to suck your blood.
[03:38:34.724 --> 03:38:39.666]  And from this blood, it was going to supposedly run all these medical tests.
[03:38:40.362 --> 03:38:42.803]  And then it was going to upload results to the Theranos company.
[03:38:43.984 --> 03:38:45.184]  You know what I think that really was?
[03:38:45.825 --> 03:39:02.072]  I think they were going to take DNA profiles and blood marker profiles of all people, tie it to your Google profile, tie it to your social security number, tie it to your bank account, tie it to your social credit score, and covertly test you for drugs.
[03:39:03.087 --> 03:39:12.389]  See, you know, if you're using an illicit drug or see if you're pregnant and then they can market, you know, pregnancy products to you even before you know you're pregnant.
[03:39:12.849 --> 03:39:19.371]  Or to genetically profile you and build a massive DNA database that would be used against you by the police state system.
[03:39:20.531 --> 03:39:21.911]  This was celebrated.
[03:39:22.371 --> 03:39:25.432]  This woman, Elizabeth Holmes, was on the cover of Fortune magazine.
[03:39:26.776 --> 03:39:34.702]  She, she was, again, it was kind of like the second coming of Christ is what we were told about, you know, in a way, about Elizabeth Holmes, that she was this amazing person.
[03:39:35.623 --> 03:39:39.586]  I don't know about you, but have you ever seen this woman talk?
[03:39:40.247 --> 03:39:42.389]  Have you ever seen, have you ever heard her voice?
[03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:45.291]  She sounds creepier than Greta!
[03:39:46.132 --> 03:39:46.992]  She doesn't blink.
[03:39:47.493 --> 03:39:50.956]  She always wore the same black turtlenecks that showed a view of her closet.
[03:39:50.976 --> 03:39:53.157]  She had like 32 copies of the same clothes.
[03:39:54.158 --> 03:39:55.059]  And she talked like
[03:39:56.596 --> 03:39:57.137]  Like a man!
[03:39:57.157 --> 03:39:57.697]  I don't know.
[03:39:57.717 --> 03:40:00.139]  And she's just full-on creepy.
[03:40:01.100 --> 03:40:03.262]  These people are way creepy.
[03:40:03.282 --> 03:40:04.222]  They're all into your blood.
[03:40:04.262 --> 03:40:06.484]  They're all into... Well, I gotta be careful.
[03:40:06.885 --> 03:40:15.672]  They're all into controlling you by profiling everything about you and stealing your information or harvesting your information, often without your consent.
[03:40:16.252 --> 03:40:19.115]  So think about just the three stories I've covered here so far today.
[03:40:20.034 --> 03:40:22.496]  We're talking about the GMO mosquito experiment gone wrong.
[03:40:23.036 --> 03:40:23.876]  Was that deliberate?
[03:40:24.297 --> 03:40:29.540]  Did they intentionally create super mutant killer mosquitoes now to wipe out people in third world countries?
[03:40:29.940 --> 03:40:31.401]  I believe there's a chance that that's true.
[03:40:32.699 --> 03:40:39.965]  What about the geoengineering, the Chemtrails experiment, Project Scopex, funded by Bill Gates, run by Harvard scientists, and also funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation?
[03:40:40.426 --> 03:40:50.495]  Global pollution to block the sun, shut down the global food supply, including, by the way, phytoplankton, which are the basis of the food webs of aquatic ecosystems, you know, ocean life.
[03:40:50.895 --> 03:40:51.796]  They're going to kill that, too.
[03:40:51.916 --> 03:40:53.017]  They're going to kill the oceans.
[03:40:53.317 --> 03:40:54.258]  They're going to kill the land.
[03:40:54.278 --> 03:40:55.439]  They're going to kill humans.
[03:40:55.999 --> 03:40:57.120]  And you can't do anything about it.
[03:40:57.160 --> 03:40:59.783]  You can't opt out, because if they block the sun,
[03:41:00.632 --> 03:41:03.678]  There's really nothing you can do except wait for all that stuff to fall out of the sky.
[03:41:03.958 --> 03:41:05.622]  And by the way, it contains lead, too.
[03:41:06.288 --> 03:41:12.332]  So you're going to have lead poisoning of the entire planet, and lead right now kills 412,000 Americans a year, according to the Lancet.
[03:41:12.572 --> 03:41:20.877]  So they're going to up that number to maybe millions of Americans a year being killed by lead while they're poisoning the food supply and collapsing the food ecosystem at the same time.
[03:41:21.098 --> 03:41:31.744]  And then, the story I just covered, the blood harvesting of every person in America with the Theranos company, which thankfully is now defunct, but they're not going to give up on this attempt.
[03:41:31.764 --> 03:41:32.445]  They're going to do it again.
[03:41:33.450 --> 03:41:56.845]  The point is, they want to profile you, they want to control you, they want to surveil you, and then, ultimately, after they're done just wringing every last dollar out of your pocket, shaking all the coins, just holding you upside down, shaking you until all your wallet falls out, and they take all your money from Big Pharma and the cancer industry, and they kidnap your children, and hit them with chemotherapy, you know, medical kidnapping, because you wanted a second opinion as a parent.
[03:41:57.165 --> 03:41:59.627]  After they're done with all that, they're just gonna kill you.
[03:42:00.501 --> 03:42:02.201]  Because they don't want you around.
[03:42:02.621 --> 03:42:03.062]  Don't you know?
[03:42:03.082 --> 03:42:04.502]  They've got the robots coming.
[03:42:05.362 --> 03:42:09.583]  They've got the robots, the automation, ready to take over the world, and they don't want you around.
[03:42:09.623 --> 03:42:17.865]  Why do you think they're pushing abortion, and infanticide, and infertility chemicals, and transgenderism, and super mutant mosquitoes that are going to kill and infect more people?
[03:42:18.465 --> 03:42:27.767]  Why do you think they're investigating and researching weaponized, biological, you know, deployment systems that can kill millions of people?
[03:42:28.817 --> 03:42:29.978]  Because they don't want you around.
[03:42:30.178 --> 03:42:34.040]  The globalists have already decided that it's the end of the line for the masses.
[03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:40.664]  And this is what, you know, Alex gets this, I get this, and this is what we're trying to warn you about.
[03:42:40.684 --> 03:42:46.467]  And I think the independent media is the only media in the world that is telling the truth about any of this.
[03:42:46.527 --> 03:42:46.788]  We are.
[03:42:46.888 --> 03:42:47.408]  We're it.
[03:42:48.132 --> 03:42:52.921]  We are humanity's last chance to stop this before they annihilate us all.
[03:42:53.341 --> 03:42:54.063]  That's what we're doing.
[03:42:54.343 --> 03:42:55.926]  That's why it's crucial that we survive.
[03:42:55.946 --> 03:42:56.687]  Thank you for your support.
[03:42:57.148 --> 03:42:59.011]  We'll be back after this break with more.
[03:43:02.824 --> 03:43:03.865]  Shut down our speech!
[03:43:04.145 --> 03:43:09.408]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:43:09.628 --> 03:43:11.229]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans.
[03:43:11.549 --> 03:43:16.592]  Almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:43:17.132 --> 03:43:17.953]  Are you coming back?
[03:43:18.473 --> 03:43:19.614]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:43:20.194 --> 03:43:21.535]  We're at newswars.com.
[03:43:21.575 --> 03:43:23.776]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[03:43:23.796 --> 03:43:25.556]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[03:43:25.817 --> 03:43:30.339]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[03:43:30.579 --> 03:43:32.820]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:43:32.840 --> 03:43:34.280]  InfoWars!
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:37.682]  Let's go, man!
[03:43:37.742 --> 03:43:37.822]  Woo!
[03:43:39.176 --> 03:43:43.358]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here that don't know about InfoWars.com.
[03:43:43.778 --> 03:43:46.399]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:43:46.899 --> 03:43:48.680]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:43:48.720 --> 03:43:52.201]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:43:52.241 --> 03:43:54.882]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:43:54.962 --> 03:43:57.203]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:43:57.243 --> 03:43:58.003]  That's where they find it.
[03:43:58.263 --> 03:43:59.543]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:44:00.224 --> 03:44:00.644]  Just go there.
[03:44:04.685 --> 03:44:14.248]  I traveled from California to Texas, and it's like a three-day drive, especially if you're not... I had a trailer behind me, so I can't go really fast.
[03:44:14.408 --> 03:44:18.309]  So I'm driving, and I love God's country, and it's beautiful.
[03:44:18.369 --> 03:44:20.129]  But being humans, we get tired.
[03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:24.711]  And even just after four hours of driving, and I'm starting to get tired, and I remembered.
[03:44:24.731 --> 03:44:26.931]  I said, oh, I have a pack of Turbo Force.
[03:44:27.071 --> 03:44:33.133]  So I reached into my console in my vehicle, and I took out the Turbo Force, and I stopped at a gas station.
[03:44:34.267 --> 03:44:35.648]  And I got me some orange juice.
[03:44:36.508 --> 03:44:37.689]  It wasn't quite this big.
[03:44:38.490 --> 03:44:40.891]  The typical size is a little bit smaller.
[03:44:40.911 --> 03:44:48.236]  And I'll put like half the packet of the Turboforce in it because the stuff is so great and so wonderful, it gets you going.
[03:44:48.716 --> 03:44:49.917]  But there's quite a bit in this one.
[03:44:49.937 --> 03:44:52.198]  So I'm going to put the whole thing in this one.
[03:44:53.179 --> 03:45:02.284]  And when I was driving from California to Texas, I took the Turboforce and I put it in orange juice.
[03:45:02.304 --> 03:45:03.365]  And I took it and I shook it up.
[03:45:05.271 --> 03:45:10.015]  Get in there real good.
[03:45:10.155 --> 03:45:12.757]  And you know what's amazing?
[03:45:12.837 --> 03:45:15.099]  It actually enheightens the taste.
[03:45:15.259 --> 03:45:16.180]  I mean, I really like it.
[03:45:16.760 --> 03:45:22.865]  I mean, I'm a big fan of orange juice already, but... Yeah.
[03:45:24.066 --> 03:45:26.167]  I mean, it's really good.
[03:45:26.367 --> 03:45:28.669]  Let me see.
[03:45:30.210 --> 03:45:30.491]  Mmm.
[03:45:31.391 --> 03:45:31.691]  Mmm.
[03:45:31.812 --> 03:45:32.072]  Wow.
[03:45:33.675 --> 03:45:36.157]  It's like energy immediately.
[03:45:36.357 --> 03:45:39.699]  The experience with Turboforce in orange juice is so different.
[03:45:39.719 --> 03:45:43.822]  A lot of people just take it and put it in water and they never thought about putting it in orange juice.
[03:45:43.942 --> 03:45:44.783]  It's completely different.
[03:45:44.883 --> 03:45:47.605]  So the orange juice, it like intensifies the taste.
[03:45:47.665 --> 03:45:48.146]  But you know what?
[03:45:48.306 --> 03:45:50.727]  I'm not talking about it just so people will buy it.
[03:45:50.827 --> 03:45:52.949]  I'm talking about it because it's my personal experience.
[03:45:53.089 --> 03:45:54.650]  It's like it brightens the orange juice up.
[03:45:54.750 --> 03:45:55.771]  I can't really explain it.
[03:45:55.811 --> 03:45:58.373]  You have to buy it and try it yourself to understand.
[03:45:58.493 --> 03:45:58.773]  Do you have
[03:46:15.802 --> 03:46:16.322]  Pass out.
[03:46:16.483 --> 03:46:21.587]  And you know, I've had so many people come up to me and said, Will, I tried it with the orange juice and I love it.
[03:46:21.767 --> 03:46:24.970]  And with the Turbo Force, I mean, it's like the missing ingredient.
[03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:28.452]  I mean, seriously, Turbo Force is the missing ingredient in the orange juice.
[03:46:28.592 --> 03:46:30.334]  And I'm addicted to it.
[03:46:30.694 --> 03:46:31.455]  The Turbo Force.
[03:46:32.700 --> 03:46:33.961]  At InfowarsStore.com.
[03:46:35.001 --> 03:46:37.022]  Most of the time, they keep it on sale.
[03:46:37.402 --> 03:46:40.023]  And I'm like, how are they able to do that?
[03:46:40.083 --> 03:46:41.924]  They keep it on sale for so long.
[03:46:42.044 --> 03:46:52.428]  And I think, now I've never been told this, but I think the main reason why they keep it on sale and they keep the price so low is that so people will try it and you will be amazed.
[03:46:52.648 --> 03:46:53.908]  So get the Turbo Force today.
[03:46:53.988 --> 03:46:55.089]  InfowarsStore.com.
[03:47:05.208 --> 03:47:11.173]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:16.598 --> 03:47:22.904]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:47:27.412 --> 03:47:33.035]  The upshot of all of this that we're talking about today here on the Alex Jones Show, thanks for continuing with us.
[03:47:33.055 --> 03:47:34.476]  This is Mike Adams from Natural News.
[03:47:34.976 --> 03:47:44.121]  The upshot is that there is a global effort, you know, to devastate human life and to devastate the ecosystem that supports us.
[03:47:44.722 --> 03:47:47.203]  There's a collapse of the biosphere that's being engineered.
[03:47:47.924 --> 03:47:52.586]  And if you oppose it, you are called anti-environmentalist.
[03:47:52.766 --> 03:47:55.708]  You know, the environmentalists themselves are calling for this collapse.
[03:47:56.257 --> 03:47:57.940]  And they will be the ones who are most impacted.
[03:47:58.380 --> 03:48:05.872]  But in terms of practical things that you can do, it's become obvious to me that you're going to have to be able to live a year without food.
[03:48:06.980 --> 03:48:09.081]  I mean, without, you know, grocery store food.
[03:48:09.542 --> 03:48:11.983]  Yeah, you're going to need to stockpile some food.
[03:48:12.003 --> 03:48:14.104]  You're going to need to stockpile supplies like never before.
[03:48:14.124 --> 03:48:25.671]  And I want to bring your attention to the fact that the government itself has entire underground cities and caves, networks, massive amounts of supplies.
[03:48:25.711 --> 03:48:30.694]  Remember a couple of years ago when they purchased, I think DHS bought like 2 billion rounds of ammunition?
[03:48:31.414 --> 03:48:32.315]  Where do you think all that went?
[03:48:32.355 --> 03:48:33.856]  It went into the storage caves.
[03:48:34.693 --> 03:48:40.056]  They've got caves in different locations all around the country, built in limestone in Kansas City, for example.
[03:48:40.917 --> 03:48:42.818]  I've driven by some of those caves before.
[03:48:43.178 --> 03:48:49.122]  They've got underground cities, they've got underground bunkers, I mean, huge places, and they're prepared for years underground.
[03:48:49.842 --> 03:48:56.266]  Meanwhile, the government recommendation to you is to have enough supplies for three days.
[03:48:57.247 --> 03:49:01.810]  So you're supposed to have three days of food, and they've got like ten years.
[03:49:02.521 --> 03:49:03.001]  Ready to go.
[03:49:03.462 --> 03:49:03.722]  You know?
[03:49:04.222 --> 03:49:08.445]  Because, of course, the globalists believe that they need to survive, but you don't.
[03:49:09.366 --> 03:49:13.910]  And they are now, what's obvious to me, they are planning to decimate the surface of the Earth.
[03:49:14.410 --> 03:49:20.494]  They're trying to turn the surface of the Earth, all the plants, all the food crops, you know, all the seeds, everything.
[03:49:20.514 --> 03:49:22.396]  The pollinators are in collapse right now.
[03:49:22.896 --> 03:49:24.037]  Ocean life is in collapse.
[03:49:24.537 --> 03:49:27.940]  You know, even the human cities are collapsing in many cases when they're run by liberals.
[03:49:29.193 --> 03:49:38.075]  As they collapse the surface of the Earth, the globalists will tend to move into their bunkers and their caves for long-term survival as the whole system collapses around them.
[03:49:38.635 --> 03:49:44.596]  We're talking about the collapse of nations, the collapse of governments, collapse of economies, banking, currency systems.
[03:49:45.616 --> 03:49:47.436]  Yeah, this is their plan.
[03:49:47.456 --> 03:49:48.376]  It's kind of a reboot.
[03:49:48.496 --> 03:49:54.137]  It's a planetary-scale reboot because they don't want what they call useless eaters to be around.
[03:49:54.497 --> 03:49:56.378]  That's how they consider you and me.
[03:49:56.438 --> 03:49:57.838]  They call us useless eaters.
[03:49:58.484 --> 03:50:04.494]  In their minds, the globalist minds, we have nothing to offer the world and we're just consuming their resources.
[03:50:04.774 --> 03:50:06.798]  So this is how they plan to do it.
[03:50:06.838 --> 03:50:08.260]  It's now incredibly obvious.
[03:50:10.782 --> 03:50:13.664]  The thing is, some humans will survive this.
[03:50:14.044 --> 03:50:18.147]  Some people will make it through, even living, you know, on the surface of the earth.
[03:50:18.447 --> 03:50:23.990]  Even if you don't have a 10-year bunker cave funded by the federal government, you can still make it through.
[03:50:24.390 --> 03:50:29.113]  And it all comes down to your preparedness level and also your location.
[03:50:29.654 --> 03:50:31.595]  So let's talk about location here for a second.
[03:50:32.498 --> 03:50:35.199]  I recently returned from a conference in Branson, Missouri.
[03:50:35.679 --> 03:50:42.221]  And by the way, thank you many of you who came up to say hello and to say that you're fans of InfoWars and so on.
[03:50:42.541 --> 03:50:49.062]  I think I shook the hands of at least 250, maybe 300 people during just the breaks at that conference.
[03:50:49.583 --> 03:50:57.265]  One of the things I got to do was talk behind the scenes with high-level government people who are patriots inside the government.
[03:50:58.325 --> 03:50:58.845]  We're talking like
[03:50:59.622 --> 03:51:05.487]  Alex Jones fans working inside high levels of different federal agencies, including DHS and others.
[03:51:06.227 --> 03:51:09.950]  And these people, what they told me was really interesting.
[03:51:10.571 --> 03:51:22.721]  They told me that number one, they're all convinced that Trump is going to win re-election in 2020, but they're also convinced that it's over for America by the end of Trump's second term.
[03:51:23.601 --> 03:51:24.422]  So really what they're saying is 2025,
[03:51:26.312 --> 03:51:28.373]  America is over as we know it.
[03:51:28.833 --> 03:51:30.793]  And I've had the same analysis and prediction.
[03:51:31.213 --> 03:51:31.813]  Same conclusion.
[03:51:32.373 --> 03:51:40.895]  Because what these people told me is that they were deployed in California, Oregon, Washington against Antifa and left-wing lunatics.
[03:51:40.915 --> 03:51:44.336]  And they've been deployed at the border to try to protect ICE facilities and so on.
[03:51:44.576 --> 03:51:49.898]  And they see that the radical left is so far gone that there is no coming together again as a nation.
[03:51:50.438 --> 03:51:51.178]  If Trump wins,
[03:51:52.057 --> 03:52:01.043]  In 2020, the left is going to break away in certain ways or try to cause so much chaos that they destroy the whole country, they bring everything down with them.
[03:52:01.803 --> 03:52:05.286]  America as we know it will not exist past 2025.
[03:52:06.186 --> 03:52:07.107]  That's what I'm being told.
[03:52:07.667 --> 03:52:08.968]  And I think that's accurate.
[03:52:09.448 --> 03:52:20.756]  And I think that in this time of turmoil, when you have political turmoil combined with this geoengineering and chemtrails and mass poisoning of the food supply and the cultural pushing of transgenderism and all these poisons in the food,
[03:52:21.573 --> 03:52:22.133]  And vaccines.
[03:52:23.614 --> 03:52:23.754]  5G.
[03:52:23.774 --> 03:52:24.635]  You know, the list goes on.
[03:52:25.455 --> 03:52:28.037]  This is going to be a time of incredible collapse.
[03:52:28.817 --> 03:52:31.178]  A very risky time for America.
[03:52:31.198 --> 03:52:32.479]  A very risky time to be alive.
[03:52:32.959 --> 03:52:37.602]  But the second biggest factor that I was told really matters is where you are.
[03:52:38.002 --> 03:52:41.544]  Because the hot spots of all of this are going to be very localized.
[03:52:42.544 --> 03:52:49.288]  If you are anywhere near Sacramento, California, or Los Angeles, or Portland, you're in trouble because of what's coming.
[03:52:49.907 --> 03:52:57.714]  But if you're out in the middle of Utah, let's say, or Tennessee, or Montana, it's not such a big deal.
[03:52:58.534 --> 03:53:07.662]  This point was really driven home to me, based on the analysis of these federal agents and some special ops people, and just real high-level people, but very dedicated patriots.
[03:53:08.283 --> 03:53:13.347]  They said they know, this is what all the models that they've been taught, this is what it tells them, that
[03:53:14.475 --> 03:53:19.796]  America's, the quote, civil war is only going to be very, very localized.
[03:53:20.737 --> 03:53:22.137]  Not even regional, but local.
[03:53:22.717 --> 03:53:23.397]  That's what they said.
[03:53:23.798 --> 03:53:28.039]  Certain cities, just certain areas around those cities, certain counties, that's it.
[03:53:28.819 --> 03:53:32.340]  Most of America is not going to be in a kinetic engagement.
[03:53:33.560 --> 03:53:38.141]  But what will affect all of America will fix problems.
[03:53:38.662 --> 03:53:39.722]  How do you get your food?
[03:53:40.082 --> 03:53:43.603]  Getting trucks to the grocery stores, getting fuel supplies, refineries.
[03:53:44.261 --> 03:53:44.841]  Uh, functioning.
[03:53:45.622 --> 03:53:48.564]  You know, we saw an attack on the refineries in Saudi Arabia recently.
[03:53:48.604 --> 03:53:58.030]  That could easily happen in America if some radical leftists want to shut down fossil fuels and they start flying, you know, explosive-laden drones into refineries in Texas or something.
[03:53:58.431 --> 03:53:59.752]  The fuel supplies could be cut off.
[03:54:00.352 --> 03:54:02.714]  Power grid could be shut down in certain scenarios.
[03:54:03.034 --> 03:54:04.315]  Food supplies could be cut off.
[03:54:04.735 --> 03:54:10.519]  So, those of us who live in middle America, even if you're not in one of these lunatic left-wing cities,
[03:54:11.266 --> 03:54:27.292]  Yeah, you're probably not going to have to kinetically engage a zombie apocalypse, but you are going to have to survive a year or more without potentially food, fuel, medicine, electricity, all the supplies that you depend on every day.
[03:54:27.592 --> 03:54:31.213]  So I want you to really think carefully about where you are.
[03:54:32.194 --> 03:54:34.755]  Do you need to relocate before 2025?
[03:54:36.818 --> 03:54:41.060]  Or even it could be sooner, depending on what happens in the 2020 election and how insane the left becomes.
[03:54:42.321 --> 03:54:46.343]  What supplies do you really need and do you know how to use those supplies?
[03:54:46.784 --> 03:54:48.965]  Have you tried cooking your stored food?
[03:54:48.985 --> 03:54:51.406]  You know, have you boiled water on a camp stove?
[03:54:52.447 --> 03:54:54.268]  Have you even tasted your stored food?
[03:54:54.909 --> 03:54:57.130]  Because a lot of it doesn't taste that great, depending on where you got it.
[03:54:57.570 --> 03:54:58.630]  So check it all out.
[03:54:58.730 --> 03:55:00.151]  Use what you have.
[03:55:00.611 --> 03:55:01.451]  Learn the skills.
[03:55:01.732 --> 03:55:05.273]  Because this right here, your brain, is what's going to save your life during all of this.
[03:55:05.853 --> 03:55:08.594]  And by the way, again, I was told it's over for America.
[03:55:09.614 --> 03:55:11.315]  I wish that wasn't the case.
[03:55:11.375 --> 03:55:12.275]  I'm not hoping for that.
[03:55:12.375 --> 03:55:13.176]  I love America.
[03:55:14.156 --> 03:55:16.437]  I want to see America great again.
[03:55:16.637 --> 03:55:17.817]  I want to see Trump succeed.
[03:55:18.718 --> 03:55:21.999]  As long as he's pro-America and pro-Constitution, pro-Republic.
[03:55:22.665 --> 03:55:24.006]  Pro-First Amendment, a Second Amendment.
[03:55:24.086 --> 03:55:25.547]  I want to see America come back strong.
[03:55:25.788 --> 03:55:29.751]  But what I'm being told is that it's over for America as we know it.
[03:55:30.191 --> 03:55:34.114]  There's no coming back from the lawlessness of the left.
[03:55:34.494 --> 03:55:38.137]  The lunacy, the mass mental illness that they have thrust upon this world.
[03:55:38.157 --> 03:55:43.141]  I mean, look, the New York Times is just basically a fiction rag at this point with their attacks on Kavanaugh.
[03:55:43.581 --> 03:55:44.842]  CNN is a total joke.
[03:55:45.123 --> 03:55:48.485]  You have to have a lobotomy just to be able to watch CNN these days.
[03:55:48.545 --> 03:55:49.166]  It's so bad.
[03:55:49.901 --> 03:55:54.105]  You know, this is crucial for you to understand, for all of us to understand.
[03:55:54.805 --> 03:55:58.269]  America as we know it may be over in the next few years.
[03:55:58.849 --> 03:56:00.110]  So what comes out of that?
[03:56:01.271 --> 03:56:06.276]  I say that we, the people, you and me, and those of us who believe in
[03:56:07.094 --> 03:56:12.358]  Liberty, and we believe in divinity, and we believe in human rights and civil liberties.
[03:56:12.658 --> 03:56:22.126]  The right to speak, the right to practice religion, the right to worship, the right to carry and keep and bear arms, the right to own any firearm you want.
[03:56:22.986 --> 03:56:31.793]  These rights must be enshrined in the next society that we rebuild after the planned, engineered collapse of this society.
[03:56:32.073 --> 03:56:34.015]  And by the way, let me remind you,
[03:56:34.668 --> 03:56:50.901]  We must enshrine health freedom, medical freedom in the next society's documents because we cannot tolerate government medical kidnapping children, imprisoning parents because they won't poison their children with chemotherapy or vaccines.
[03:56:51.241 --> 03:56:51.982]  That has got to stop.
[03:56:52.580 --> 03:56:56.622]  We've got to have, you know, maybe a third amendment that's health freedom.
[03:56:57.082 --> 03:57:00.864]  Like, move the current third amendment about quartering soldiers in your house.
[03:57:00.924 --> 03:57:02.584]  Like, kick that on down the line.
[03:57:02.624 --> 03:57:04.045]  Keep it, but make it a later amendment.
[03:57:04.405 --> 03:57:08.267]  Insert a new third amendment that no one shall be forced.
[03:57:09.016 --> 03:57:13.739]  To engage in medicine against their beliefs or wishes for themselves or their children.
[03:57:14.099 --> 03:57:15.760]  That's what we need, in my opinion.
[03:57:16.100 --> 03:57:17.361]  That's something we have to keep in mind.
[03:57:17.401 --> 03:57:20.023]  It was kind of missing from the original Bill of Rights.
[03:57:20.323 --> 03:57:30.950]  Interestingly, Benjamin Rush tried to put it in there, but I guess not enough people thought that was important at the time, because no one could imagine medical kidnapping of children by government, which is what's happening today.
[03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:33.111]  So these are some things to keep in mind.
[03:57:33.846 --> 03:57:35.649]  Of course, keep watching InfoWars.com.
[03:57:35.709 --> 03:57:37.792]  I'll keep covering this as best I can as well.
[03:57:37.812 --> 03:57:39.174]  I'll keep contributing to InfoWars.
[03:57:40.196 --> 03:57:40.757]  Get prepared.
[03:57:41.418 --> 03:57:42.059]  Stay informed.
[03:57:43.281 --> 03:57:45.504]  And relocate if you have to, because it's coming.
[03:57:45.785 --> 03:57:47.047]  And there's nothing we can do to stop it.
[03:57:47.768 --> 03:57:48.429]  Thank you for watching.
[03:57:53.922 --> 03:57:58.106]  Here's Alex Jones displaying, putting the tinfoil hat on display.
[03:57:58.206 --> 03:58:10.158]  As you can see, the tinfoil hat was once a one-piece tinfoil hat meant to sit on your head comfortably, has now evolved into not just a tinfoil hat, but an adjustable antenna.
[03:58:10.238 --> 03:58:12.761]  So not only do you have the tinfoil hat to
[03:58:12.841 --> 03:58:24.328]  To protect yourself against fake news and predict the future, now it's included a tinfoil hat antenna, adjustable antenna, so you can pick up the InfoWars streams wherever you are on planet Earth.
[03:58:24.509 --> 03:58:29.132]  It's the brand new InfoWars tinfoil hat with adjustable antenna.
[03:58:29.192 --> 03:58:37.437]  We're working on getting the satellite feeds up and ready so that you can tune in to the InfoWars live broadcast with your tinfoil hat passion.
[03:58:37.737 --> 03:58:38.137]  Vogue.
[03:58:38.358 --> 03:58:38.658]  Power.
[03:58:39.018 --> 03:58:39.759]  Alex Jones.
[03:58:39.939 --> 03:58:40.840]  Tinfoil Hat.
[03:58:41.040 --> 03:58:46.124]  Now, Alex is a man of many talents, but you didn't know he had that type of catwalk ability.
[03:58:46.144 --> 03:58:47.325]  Just look at the attitude.
[03:58:47.645 --> 03:58:49.967]  Look at the flippant nature of defiance.
[03:58:50.287 --> 03:58:51.228]  Look at the rebellion.
[03:58:51.588 --> 03:58:53.050]  Oh, just total defiance.
[03:58:53.290 --> 03:58:58.334]  It's the brand new Infowars Tinfoil and Tinfoil Hat with adjustable antenna.
[03:58:58.414 --> 03:58:59.255]  You can pick up HD
