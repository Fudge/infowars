[00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.342]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:13.342 --> 00:00:27.588]  We've gotten to the point here on air with what InfoWars does and the caliber of listenership we have
[00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:43.607]  The poll we have, and not just this government, but other governments, that any one of these broadcasts could easily be my last.
[00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:44.688]  And that goes for anybody.
[00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:53.935]  Anybody could go down in a car wreck, or have a heart attack, or a stroke, or be hit by a meteorite, or get carjacked.
[00:00:53.935 --> 00:01:05.564]  But I can tell you that we're in waters with what's happening to Infowars, where it's a bellwether, or a trigger point, a tripwire.
[00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:20.851]  That the deep state war against the attempt to get our country back under our own government's control has gone into a whole nother phase and a whole nother strata of an atmosphere.
[00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:27.997]  And as I sit here and look at all this news and the intel I have, people need to understand something.
[00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:30.019]  And I don't say this to brag, the enemy knows this.
[00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:33.622]  90% of the time, I don't get intel.
[00:01:35.322 --> 00:01:38.725]  I create the intel.
[00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:39.665]  And that's not bragging.
[00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.748]  The Democrats, the globalists know that.
[00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:57.298]  They know that I am highly respected by patriots in our government, in the military, and in intelligence agencies, because they know what I'm talking about is what they've already researched to be true, and I'm the only person on air that will go that far.
[00:01:57.298 --> 00:02:04.544]  We got the FISA memo from Intel, though, from William Binning, right after he met with the President.
[00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:12.075]  Now I was asked by Benny not to say where he got it, but I think people can figure it out.
[00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:15.737]  Certainly the enemy can.
[00:02:15.737 --> 00:02:21.940]  So we're not up here, you know, talking about how cool we are or any of this crap.
[00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.002]  This is a real war for the country.
[00:02:25.002 --> 00:02:31.406]  I did a special report last night, Will Johnson in studio and Robert Barnes in studio, and we played a Fox News clip.
[00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:52.191]  Uh, from Laura Ingraham, where she had these big Republican lawyers on and Governor Huckabee on, and they were laying out the FISA memo that we broke in January of last year, and then it broke in a couple of major newspapers two months later, and that's why the hell keeps breaking loose.
[00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:56.454]  Now, I'm not up here bragging about that.
[00:02:56.454 --> 00:02:59.456]  The President knew all this, and no one else would even cover it.
[00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:04.175]  A year and a half ago.
[00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:05.895]  We would.
[00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:14.018]  So the President sits down with William Benny, and then a week later, William Benny is on my show, contacting me, former head of the NSA.
[00:03:14.018 --> 00:03:16.318]  You know, the guy that actually ran it.
[00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:18.459]  Not the political head, the actual head of it.
[00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.199]  The technical head.
[00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.160]  And so I'm just saying, it's not like our sources are right in front of you.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.282]  Oh, here's the most highly decorated person in NSA history, super codebreaker with a 200 IQ,
[00:03:29.616 --> 00:03:37.360]  That can do mathematics into the eighth dimension, and he's meeting with Trump, and then now we're getting this intel.
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.863]  And by the way, the FISA court put this out saying Obama came to us and criminally lied to us for three warrants.
[00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:45.425]  They covered their own ass when they found out about this.
[00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.186]  We told you about it.
[00:03:47.186 --> 00:03:48.887]  We broke it.
[00:03:48.887 --> 00:03:52.248]  And then what was the response?
[00:03:52.248 --> 00:03:55.870]  All hell breaks loose.
[00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.271]  Now it's on Fox News in 2019.
[00:03:59.013 --> 00:03:59.874]  So, here's the deal.
[00:03:59.874 --> 00:04:06.223]  You're going to get next year's news today until they shot us down or kill me.
[00:04:06.223 --> 00:04:08.005]  And I want you to understand something.
[00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:12.391]  The frustration is, Kennedy is willing to put this stuff on air.
[00:04:12.391 --> 00:04:14.254]  There's certain things Fox won't let him put on air.
[00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:16.403]  He's very frustrated.
[00:04:16.403 --> 00:04:18.185]  They threatened to fire him dozens of times.
[00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:18.685]  They pulled him.
[00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:21.968]  He's fired and backed off because he said he was going on there with stuff.
[00:04:21.968 --> 00:04:22.668]  Hannity's good.
[00:04:22.668 --> 00:04:24.250]  So is Tucker Carlson.
[00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.852]  I'm just saying they don't own News Corp.
[00:04:26.852 --> 00:04:28.593]  I own InfoWars.
[00:04:28.593 --> 00:04:32.537]  So one reason that we're so awesome is we're not awesome.
[00:04:32.537 --> 00:04:33.858]  We're just willing to do it.
[00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.033]  So, I got a lot more.
[00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:39.514]  I told you I was in D.C.
[00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:42.176]  a few weeks ago.
[00:04:42.176 --> 00:04:46.318]  And I was meeting with people that are writing the direct reports to the President.
[00:04:46.318 --> 00:04:48.839]  And we're compiling reports to the President.
[00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:51.241]  I was compiling reports to the President through U.S.
[00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:53.302]  intelligence agencies on Friday.
[00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:55.283]  What the hell do you think's going on here?
[00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:57.024]  It's now time for people to learn the truth.
[00:04:57.024 --> 00:04:57.985]  I'm gonna tell you when we come back.
[00:05:00.874 --> 00:05:06.076]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:14.660]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.621]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:19.382]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:25.644]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:33.068]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:36.010]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.612]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:05:39.612 --> 00:05:43.934]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:45.755]  I've got two in my home.
[00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:51.838]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:05:51.838 --> 00:05:52.679]  Don't live
[00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:57.581]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[00:05:57.581 --> 00:05:58.842]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:12.678]  Big Brother.
[00:06:12.678 --> 00:06:14.459]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:16.360]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.060]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.721]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:24.424]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:30.480]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.962]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:06:32.962 --> 00:06:34.984]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:40.188]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[00:06:40.188 --> 00:06:48.795]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:06:48.795 --> 00:06:53.799]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:58.000]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.821]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[00:07:06.821 --> 00:07:08.382]  I have no issue with it at all.
[00:07:08.382 --> 00:07:09.462]  I want them shut down.
[00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:10.422]  I want them silenced.
[00:07:10.422 --> 00:07:11.262]  I want them muted.
[00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:14.403]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:07:14.403 --> 00:07:15.803]  I want them shut down!
[00:07:15.803 --> 00:07:17.363]  I want them silenced!
[00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:18.603]  I want them muted!
[00:07:18.603 --> 00:07:19.864]  But don't worry.
[00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:21.544]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:07:24.753 --> 00:07:27.955]  Don't worry, these people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:32.716]  Every major public university in the U.S.
[00:07:32.716 --> 00:07:38.899]  does re-education camp training, teaching everyone that America sucks.
[00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:46.842]  You know the soundtrack running in the re-education camp in the fictitious Soviet invasion of the U.S., Red Dawn?
[00:07:48.717 --> 00:08:00.666]  The stuff they say on national news is worse than what you hear in a fictitious movie of a Soviet takeover of the U.S., how much we suck, how bad our forefathers are, how bad men are, how bad families are.
[00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:13.396]  We're experiencing classical demoralization, classical brainwashing, and we've been so manipulated by the Neocon Heritage Foundation and others that, oh, private companies can do whatever they want.
[00:08:13.396 --> 00:08:15.398]  Boulderdash.
[00:08:15.398 --> 00:08:17.379]  Boulderdash.
[00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:18.060]  Total baloney.
[00:08:20.993 --> 00:08:25.875]  And Big Tech's pissed, because they know that I'm working with others, and I get reports and briefings from the President.
[00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:30.496]  And the President goes and checks it, and finds out it's true, and says, why the hell wasn't I told this?
[00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:32.557]  And that's the main reason they want us off the air.
[00:08:32.557 --> 00:08:35.878]  It's not even about the big audience, it's not even about... No.
[00:08:35.878 --> 00:08:42.060]  That's the main thing, because Trump... ...researches Infowars.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.521]  So Brian Stelter might have finally said something true this weekend.
[00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:46.921]  Even broken clocks are right.
[00:08:46.921 --> 00:08:48.662]  Twice a day, blind pigs can find acorns.
[00:08:51.476 --> 00:08:55.597]  When he said Trump is the Infowars Presidency.
[00:08:55.597 --> 00:08:57.538]  No, it's just the return of Americana.
[00:08:57.538 --> 00:08:59.198]  So let's get into the facts here.
[00:08:59.198 --> 00:09:01.679]  This is not a Gonzo Journalism broadcast.
[00:09:01.679 --> 00:09:03.859]  This is not about me.
[00:09:03.859 --> 00:09:07.320]  But we're the number one domino to be falling here.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:14.682]  And if other people don't stand up for us, it's designed that way, then the entire First Amendment goes down.
[00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:28.386]  That's why Louis Farrakhan, who you would not call a right-winger, was slipped into Paul Joseph Watson, because he's incredibly effective, and Laura Loomer, and others that are very effective, in the five people that got banned off of Facebook.
[00:09:28.386 --> 00:09:29.726]  And it wasn't being banned.
[00:09:29.726 --> 00:09:30.966]  I was already banned off Facebook.
[00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:35.667]  They banned a bunch of fan pages and sent in a press release.
[00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:45.189]  If you say the name Alex Jones or Infowars.com, you will be reprimanded, and if you do it again, we'll ban you.
[00:09:46.089 --> 00:09:54.471]  That is a corporate gag order to 2.2 billion users who were induced to come in with false advertising and told they had free speech.
[00:09:54.471 --> 00:10:10.076]  And now they've got artificial intelligence in place, he admits that, telling you, telling you that you will not say someone's name unless it's negative.
[00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:12.797]  And I'm going to show you the press release, but it's all over Twitter.
[00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.831]  Not on Facebook, they don't allow it.
[00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:22.473]  People are posting the message they get from Facebook, prominent journalists, where they say, God bless Alex Jones.
[00:10:22.473 --> 00:10:24.093]  Or they say, Alex Jones has a right to free speech.
[00:10:24.093 --> 00:10:29.035]  I'm going to show you these screenshots and put them on screen for TV viewers, radio listeners that are on Infowars.com.
[00:10:29.035 --> 00:10:31.836]  And they get an instant message, meaning it's AI.
[00:10:31.836 --> 00:10:36.358]  I mean, they get it in one millisecond.
[00:10:36.358 --> 00:10:40.679]  You are not allowed to say, God bless Alex Jones and Infowars.
[00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:43.480]  Stop the censorship of conservatives.
[00:10:46.018 --> 00:10:46.798]  Free Alex Jones.
[00:10:46.798 --> 00:10:49.459]  And they said, only you can see this post.
[00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:54.441]  If you request a review, they'll have someone take another look at your post.
[00:10:54.441 --> 00:11:05.245]  That is the press release they put out on Thursday, where they said you are only allowed to explicitly condemn Alex Jones.
[00:11:05.245 --> 00:11:09.307]  So this has never been done in the history of speech.
[00:11:09.307 --> 00:11:10.867]  Not by the Chai Comps.
[00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:11.808]  Not in fictitious 1984.
[00:11:11.808 --> 00:11:14.669]  Not in Stalin's Russia.
[00:11:15.942 --> 00:11:17.103]  Not in Hitler's Germany.
[00:11:17.103 --> 00:11:26.889]  They never said, you cannot say someone's name, or an organization's name, or we will penalize you.
[00:11:26.889 --> 00:11:39.377]  This is next level, breaking ground, history book level, science fiction dystopia, tyranny on steroids.
[00:11:39.377 --> 00:11:39.877]  To the next level.
[00:11:42.082 --> 00:11:44.403]  And of course the President comes out and says this is wrong.
[00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:45.884]  But it gets even better.
[00:11:45.884 --> 00:11:48.946]  They can try to take stuff out of context and lie about me.
[00:11:48.946 --> 00:12:00.353]  Paul Watson is, I don't want to say milk toast, but it's very, very pastoral compared to the left on MSNBC.
[00:12:00.353 --> 00:12:02.495]  And he was in thousands of newspapers.
[00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:10.918]  Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan, and other white supremacists like Paul Watson banned from Facebook.
[00:12:10.918 --> 00:12:30.922]  So they defame you while silencing you and silencing 2.2 billion users and slapping them in the face and saying you will not say someone's name.
[00:12:32.182 --> 00:12:33.423]  This isn't Harry Potter, folks.
[00:12:33.423 --> 00:12:34.303]  I'm not Voldemort.
[00:12:34.303 --> 00:12:35.924]  Now, I want to explain something.
[00:12:35.924 --> 00:12:36.964]  People ask, how are you doing?
[00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:38.084]  Family calls.
[00:12:38.084 --> 00:12:38.965]  How are you doing?
[00:12:38.965 --> 00:12:42.846]  Well, we tried to say you're a good person, and it said it'd ban us.
[00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:46.788]  I got, you know, cousins calling me, and I'm like, how are you doing?
[00:12:46.788 --> 00:12:48.709]  You think I'm worried about me?
[00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:55.692]  You think I'm a shrieking violent that got into this because I'm all worried about me?
[00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.173]  Your children are having their entire birthright
[00:13:00.168 --> 00:13:04.289]  Stolen from you right now.
[00:13:04.289 --> 00:13:05.190]  Look at the history books.
[00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.070]  This has never before been done.
[00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.871]  Here's the big announcements.
[00:13:10.871 --> 00:13:12.672]  I've watched the congressional hearings last year.
[00:13:12.672 --> 00:13:13.792]  Anybody can look it up.
[00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:27.337]  Facebook and Twitter and Google told them that by the end of 2018, AI would be in full control and censoring and that quote, info war stories will never be at the top of any of our sites again.
[00:13:27.337 --> 00:13:28.397]  That was their answer to bury it.
[00:13:31.172 --> 00:13:32.152]  Well, guess what?
[00:13:32.152 --> 00:13:34.053]  They already had the AI partially in place.
[00:13:34.053 --> 00:13:35.854]  We were still the top everywhere.
[00:13:35.854 --> 00:13:39.335]  Because we say things that nobody else is saying that are really true.
[00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:39.896]  And that resonate.
[00:13:39.896 --> 00:13:42.297]  And they were bitching all over the news earlier this week.
[00:13:42.297 --> 00:13:46.739]  Oh my God, Jones claims Biden had brain surgery and is slurring his words.
[00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:48.059]  He almost died twice.
[00:13:48.059 --> 00:13:49.660]  He had two huge brain surgeries.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:55.042]  They removed part of his brain to the Associated Press, 1988 and then years later.
[00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:56.823]  He was slurring in his big announcement speech.
[00:13:57.659 --> 00:14:00.763]  He just said that Margaret Thatcher called him last year.
[00:14:00.763 --> 00:14:03.446]  Margaret Thatcher's been dead for years!
[00:14:03.446 --> 00:14:04.708]  She was the Prime Minister of England in the 80s!
[00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.391]  It's fair game to talk about people's health.
[00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:10.733]  They talked about Reagan's, McCain's.
[00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:16.557]  They admit they shut us down because we had the number one post on Instagram and Facebook last week.
[00:14:16.557 --> 00:14:23.222]  A video, just from a clip of the show, with me showing him slur his words, a five minute video, had something like 60 million views.
[00:14:23.222 --> 00:14:26.644]  They crapped themselves everywhere and they said, that's it, banning.
[00:14:26.644 --> 00:14:27.685]  Well, what are we going to do?
[00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:29.286]  They're going to say he's a conservative.
[00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:31.848]  Well, just put Louis Farrakhan in there.
[00:14:31.848 --> 00:14:33.469]  And then we can call Jones an anti-Semite.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:49.370]  When anybody that knows anything about my show or the internet knows, for whatever mentally ill reason, you go to the white supremacists, they hate me like the Wicked Witch of the East in Wizard of Oz hates buckets of water, man.
[00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.514]  Which I don't even, because most of the white supremacists are leftist funded, I know why.
[00:14:53.514 --> 00:14:55.695]  But it's come out in court.
[00:14:55.695 --> 00:14:59.639]  But man, saying that I'm an anti-Semite, that is really rich.
[00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:03.622]  When I'm supposedly work for Israel, which is another load of crap,
[00:15:05.077 --> 00:15:07.758]  Don't work for Russia, don't work for Israel, don't work for the Vatican.
[00:15:07.758 --> 00:15:11.098]  I work for the red, white, and blue in my children and your children's future.
[00:15:11.098 --> 00:15:14.559]  And I don't compromise, and I'm damn effective, and everybody knows it.
[00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:18.940]  I'm bonafide, I'm real, and everybody knows it.
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:24.541]  And see, they don't like that in this world, having somebody that's real and stands for what they believe in.
[00:15:24.541 --> 00:15:30.123]  Trump, neurotically, stands for what he believes in and is committed and really trying to get stuff done.
[00:15:30.123 --> 00:15:31.623]  That's why they hate him and say he's not real.
[00:15:32.748 --> 00:15:37.370]  Because they fear authenticity.
[00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.450]  So Trump stood up for me.
[00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.790]  Matt Drudge stood up for me.
[00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.231]  Tucker Carlson stood up.
[00:15:41.231 --> 00:15:47.933]  But so many other conservatives are like, about time you start getting rid of some of them, you know, people like Farrakhan.
[00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:52.115]  And they're just buying into the trap now of universal censorship.
[00:15:52.115 --> 00:15:56.956]  We're going to talk about the next phase of this and what's coming next and what this heralds straight ahead.
[00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:58.357]  You do not want to miss this broadcast.
[00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.371]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:16:02.371 --> 00:16:04.273]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:16:04.273 --> 00:16:04.893]  It is.
[00:16:04.893 --> 00:16:09.757]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:16:09.757 --> 00:16:11.119]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:12.920]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:18.525]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:16:18.525 --> 00:16:22.008]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[00:16:22.008 --> 00:16:24.510]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's
[00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.171]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:16:51.212 --> 00:16:57.093]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:16:57.093 --> 00:17:00.334]  I just can't do it!
[00:17:00.334 --> 00:17:04.915]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[00:17:04.915 --> 00:17:06.935]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:17:06.935 --> 00:17:08.036]  Good to talk to you.
[00:17:08.036 --> 00:17:12.677]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[00:17:12.677 --> 00:17:14.617]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:17.338]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic.
[00:17:17.338 --> 00:17:19.158]  Root, things like that, that I trust.
[00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:25.423]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[00:17:25.423 --> 00:17:26.183]  I appreciate that.
[00:17:26.183 --> 00:17:27.804]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:17:27.804 --> 00:17:28.405]  Tell us about it.
[00:17:28.405 --> 00:17:29.186]  Well, it's really great.
[00:17:29.186 --> 00:17:30.466]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:30.987]  I take it.
[00:17:30.987 --> 00:17:31.727]  It tastes good.
[00:17:31.727 --> 00:17:33.589]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:17:33.589 --> 00:17:35.530]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.013]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[00:17:39.053 --> 00:17:41.877]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:17:41.877 --> 00:17:43.639]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:17:43.639 --> 00:17:45.722]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:17:45.722 --> 00:17:46.623]  So, yeah.
[00:17:46.623 --> 00:17:49.066]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:51.910]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.051]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[00:20:02.843 --> 00:20:05.505]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:45.427 --> 00:20:46.627]  It's Sunday, May 5th, 2019.
[00:20:46.627 --> 00:20:52.469]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:20:52.469 --> 00:20:54.450]  And I'm going to issue a report to the President.
[00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.791]  I'm going to issue a report to you.
[00:20:55.791 --> 00:21:03.093]  I'm going to issue a report to the whole planet on what's really going on from the inside and the out.
[00:21:03.093 --> 00:21:09.215]  And again, I want to explain something.
[00:21:09.215 --> 00:21:12.456]  I don't get briefings from the U.S.
[00:21:12.456 --> 00:21:13.617]  intelligence community.
[00:21:13.617 --> 00:21:14.697]  I give them the briefings.
[00:21:15.913 --> 00:21:23.716]  And I think it's important at this point for people to understand that I'm not following orders, I'm giving the orders.
[00:21:23.716 --> 00:21:26.256]  And I don't say that in a power trip.
[00:21:26.256 --> 00:21:30.198]  I just realize we just need to go ahead and put the cards out there.
[00:21:30.198 --> 00:21:34.599]  Because the enemy knows that.
[00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:37.540]  That's why they want us off the air.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:45.303]  Now it doesn't mean there aren't a bunch of people that understand what I understand, that think just like I think, and that know more than I know in many respects.
[00:21:46.769 --> 00:22:02.075]  But you add what we do with the spirit of it and how it's done, popularizing the real fight that's happening gives incredible sucker and sustenance and support and aid and comfort to the patriots in the U.S.
[00:22:02.075 --> 00:22:10.698]  government fighting back against the deep state, working with the CHICOMS and others against our president and against the patriot movement that's taken over the Republican Party.
[00:22:10.698 --> 00:22:11.398]  We are winning.
[00:22:14.952 --> 00:22:16.172]  I told you when I went to D.C.
[00:22:16.172 --> 00:22:20.314]  a few weeks ago that I had two meetings with people that had direct meetings with Trump.
[00:22:20.314 --> 00:22:27.657]  I had another meeting with someone who had been involved in the joint meetings and was writing briefings to the President.
[00:22:27.657 --> 00:22:36.800]  And I told you that the President is intending to move to have the deep state actors indicted.
[00:22:39.554 --> 00:22:41.655]  Jeanine Pirro just came out and said that last night.
[00:22:41.655 --> 00:22:46.576]  So you keep noticing what I say years ago, what I say weeks ago, what I say days ago, word for word happens.
[00:22:46.576 --> 00:22:54.638]  It's not because I'm Oprah Winfrey in The Secret and I'm going ooga booga abracadabra and then it's happening like I'm a wizard or Emperor Palpatine.
[00:22:54.638 --> 00:22:58.779]  I'm really a serious person, heavily immersed in all this.
[00:22:58.779 --> 00:23:08.722]  And I'm sorry, most people, even career intelligence officers and others, it's all compartmentalized, they're all infighting, they're all specialized, none of them have a big audience, they don't have freedom.
[00:23:10.069 --> 00:23:13.270]  And I'm a private organic citizen.
[00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:28.317]  But the wild card in all of this, and that's why they want us off the air, and that's why they want protégés like Watson off the air, and others, is because they understand we beat them in 2016.
[00:23:28.317 --> 00:23:39.402]  We're spreading 1776 worldwide, Operation 1776 worldwide, a plan I devised and developed over a decade ago, and it has been adopted.
[00:23:41.107 --> 00:23:44.890]  And I'm not going to get into all the specifics of it, but you know most of the plan.
[00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:49.954]  But I put forward a plan that has been adopted by the President and by the patriots in U.S.
[00:23:49.954 --> 00:23:50.915]  intelligence.
[00:23:50.915 --> 00:23:53.477]  So of course the enemy shakes in fear of me.
[00:23:53.477 --> 00:23:56.660]  They're a bunch of social climbing, groveling minions.
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.740]  They're not leaders.
[00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:06.808]  And they shake in fear that we rebooted this audience, your support, your intel, your information, all of our guests, this college of ideas,
[00:24:08.097 --> 00:24:16.920]  That was the rekindling of the spirit of 1776 and that we have changed the world and have already devastated the globalists.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:29.445]  We haven't completely won, but I would compare it to Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, taking three years to turn back, but we're at the point of the collapse of the front and the beginning of the collapse of the Nazis.
[00:24:29.445 --> 00:24:31.625]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:35.767]  If you want to compare a World War II allegory, the globalists are done.
[00:24:37.438 --> 00:24:39.380]  They can try a lot of stuff.
[00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:40.160]  They can censor.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.301]  They can play games.
[00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:43.743]  They can try to finance race wars.
[00:24:43.743 --> 00:24:49.107]  Once people are awake to them, it's game over.
[00:24:49.107 --> 00:24:54.252]  Once the population knows what they're doing, they keep trying the old game when we were asleep.
[00:24:54.252 --> 00:24:58.655]  That doesn't work anymore.
[00:24:58.655 --> 00:25:02.478]  And so they're using old propaganda you use on an unconscious public.
[00:25:02.478 --> 00:25:04.240]  That may work on their zombie minions.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.581]  That's not working on awake people.
[00:25:06.883 --> 00:25:14.768]  When you sit there and point-blank lie and try to demoralize, awake people, it doesn't demoralize, it motivates.
[00:25:14.768 --> 00:25:18.291]  You think my crew's more motivated that we've been under such attack?
[00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:22.854]  Or less motivated?
[00:25:22.854 --> 00:25:24.094]  You think the average person in the U.S.
[00:25:24.094 --> 00:25:26.196]  military is less motivated or more motivated?
[00:25:26.196 --> 00:25:31.479]  You think the Border Patrol's more motivated or less motivated that they're under total attack and the border's collapsing and they're begging for help?
[00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:32.200]  They're more motivated!
[00:25:33.035 --> 00:25:36.158]  And here's the thing about fighting and about information warfare.
[00:25:36.158 --> 00:25:40.261]  When you're on the offense and you're getting stronger, the enemy's getting weaker!
[00:25:40.261 --> 00:25:41.763]  We're getting stronger!
[00:25:41.763 --> 00:25:43.724]  They're getting weaker!
[00:25:43.724 --> 00:25:46.207]  So don't ever let them trick you when it's in the news.
[00:25:46.207 --> 00:25:47.288]  Jones is being defeated.
[00:25:47.288 --> 00:25:48.549]  Jones is being destroyed.
[00:25:48.549 --> 00:25:50.010]  Jones is being shut down.
[00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:53.573]  Jones... That's all lies!
[00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:55.755]  A. Most of what they say is happening to me, is it true?
[00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:59.018]  B. It doesn't matter what happens to me in the final equation.
[00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.531]  You understand that?
[00:26:04.531 --> 00:26:07.613]  What matters is what happens to this country and this world.
[00:26:07.613 --> 00:26:15.999]  So don't ever let them kill me at a four-way stop, claiming it's a carjacking or whatever they pull, and then say, oh, look, he's dead or, you know, he's defeated.
[00:26:15.999 --> 00:26:17.700]  You're never going to be defeated.
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.121]  You're never backing down.
[00:26:19.121 --> 00:26:22.963]  You're never stopping, and I salute you.
[00:26:22.963 --> 00:26:26.145]  Now, I said I was going to be calm today, but this is just so momentous that
[00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.842]  I'm going to try to go through this piece by piece when we come back from break.
[00:26:34.842 --> 00:26:46.908]  But something the crew keeps reminding me to do, because, you know, it's not a game that if we don't bring in major funding after all the stuff they've done to us, we'll be shut down.
[00:26:48.744 --> 00:27:00.547]  Just the fact that we have to pay for all our audio and all of our video and we have millions of viewers a day and millions of listeners just on our own streams, that's millions of dollars a year just in the bandwidth, not to mention infrastructure.
[00:27:00.547 --> 00:27:11.849]  So I'll tell you, when you build something this big that does this much even for a small amount of money, I mean a newspaper that serves Austin
[00:27:13.083 --> 00:27:15.744]  Would cost something like $100 million a year to run.
[00:27:15.744 --> 00:27:18.246]  We can run this place for $25, $30 million a year.
[00:27:18.246 --> 00:27:19.987]  That's still a lot of money.
[00:27:19.987 --> 00:27:21.247]  Couldn't run it for that in New York.
[00:27:21.247 --> 00:27:24.369]  Take $100 million.
[00:27:24.369 --> 00:27:26.991]  So, this isn't a game, folks.
[00:27:26.991 --> 00:27:38.857]  I need every listener that's never gone to InfoWareStore.com for whatever reason to get off the fence and go get our coffee, go get our fish oil, go get our turmeric, get X2, get a book, get water filtration, get a video.
[00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:42.339]  These are all top of the line at great prices because that's my philosophy.
[00:27:43.905 --> 00:27:56.490]  And I'm not bitching at listeners, but I'm telling you, you couldn't spend money on insurance for you and your children and the future at a better place and get great products back at the same time.
[00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:05.733]  Now, I'm not going to go into a whole breakdown of the iodine conspiracy and how it's depleted in the soil and how our IQs and everything else are falling apart because we don't have it.
[00:28:05.733 --> 00:28:08.494]  It's rocket fuel when it's real iodine.
[00:28:09.076 --> 00:28:11.819]  You drink the iodine you get at a local health store, it'll probably kill you.
[00:28:11.819 --> 00:28:13.541]  Or, you know, stuff for topical?
[00:28:13.541 --> 00:28:14.422]  No, don't do that.
[00:28:14.422 --> 00:28:15.483]  That's not really iodine.
[00:28:15.483 --> 00:28:19.628]  It's bound garbage with... We have the real pure iodine, X2.
[00:28:19.628 --> 00:28:20.749]  Deep Earth crystal.
[00:28:20.749 --> 00:28:23.432]  A small percentage of folks can't absorb pure iodine.
[00:28:23.432 --> 00:28:25.315]  Most people can only absorb pure iodine.
[00:28:25.315 --> 00:28:25.755]  But we have X3.
[00:28:27.455 --> 00:28:33.898]  That is mainly pure iodine, but then it has the two other subtypes of it in a non-toxic way that the molecules help you upload it.
[00:28:33.898 --> 00:28:39.201]  I'm not a micro-chemist, biologist, but that's who designed it.
[00:28:39.201 --> 00:28:43.643]  Get a free bottle of X3 with X2 and it's 25% off.

[00:33:03.828 --> 00:33:06.512]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:25.718]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:30.175]  I want them shut down.
[00:33:30.175 --> 00:33:31.135]  I want them silenced.
[00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:31.975]  I want them muted.
[00:33:31.975 --> 00:33:34.537]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:33:34.537 --> 00:33:36.557]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:33:36.557 --> 00:33:41.640]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:50.384]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:33:50.384 --> 00:33:55.366]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:59.569]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[00:33:59.569 --> 00:34:08.417]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[00:34:08.417 --> 00:34:09.958]  I have no issue with it at all.
[00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:11.059]  I want them shut down.
[00:34:11.059 --> 00:34:12.020]  I want them silenced.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.841]  I want them muted.
[00:34:12.841 --> 00:34:16.004]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:34:16.004 --> 00:34:17.385]  I want them shut down!
[00:34:17.385 --> 00:34:18.966]  I want them silenced!
[00:34:18.966 --> 00:34:20.207]  I want them muted!
[00:34:20.207 --> 00:34:21.468]  But don't worry.
[00:34:21.468 --> 00:34:23.170]  These people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:34:29.332 --> 00:34:32.054]  Don't worry, these people aren't terrifying or anything.
[00:34:32.054 --> 00:34:37.457]  So, a lot of people are like, wait, you were already banned on Facebook.
[00:34:37.457 --> 00:34:41.019]  Oh, hundreds of fan sites that had popped up since I was banned last year.
[00:34:41.019 --> 00:34:43.841]  Some had 300, 400,000 followers.
[00:34:43.841 --> 00:34:47.463]  Tens of millions of views of our videos every week on there.
[00:34:47.463 --> 00:34:56.149]  And Mark Zuckerberg came out, I have the clip, and he said, we're not going to let dangerous people on Facebook anymore, and you're not going to say their names.
[00:34:57.130 --> 00:35:23.429]  And they put a press release out, they said, we have a new level of banning, and Alex Jones will be the first person ever, with AI computers, watching in live time, that if you say Alex Jones on Facebook, 2.2 billion people, that's bigger than China, that's more people than China, that's 700 million more people than China has, that's 2.2 billion people, you cannot say Alex Jones' name or info wars.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.661]  And I'm going to play clips of that and go to news articles in a moment.
[00:35:27.661 --> 00:35:30.023]  But that's not enough.
[00:35:30.023 --> 00:35:37.768]  CNN, that had 10 million viewers an hour back in Larry King's heyday, they got rid of him when it dropped to like 9 million.
[00:35:37.768 --> 00:35:40.889]  They hired Piers Morgan and it went to like 2 million.
[00:35:40.889 --> 00:35:45.632]  Now their top rated shows have a million viewers, their average show 50,000 an hour.
[00:35:45.632 --> 00:35:48.654]  Local radio shows have more listeners.
[00:35:48.654 --> 00:35:51.476]  Our restricted cutback show reaches millions an hour, a couple million.
[00:35:52.622 --> 00:36:07.491]  But don't worry, if you've got a pumpkin head and you're Brian Stelter, or you look like a rat-like possum, and it says on his bio on Facebook that Oliver Darcy is a defender of free speech, all he is is a little tattletale that runs around making stuff up about people and getting them banned.
[00:36:07.491 --> 00:36:17.076]  He was breathlessly on the show for several segments, but at the end he says, there's WhatsApp, though, that Facebook owns, and we're looking into banning it.
[00:36:17.076 --> 00:36:18.417]  Making sure Alex Jones doesn't have it.
[00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:27.593]  See, last year, he knew who all my sponsors were on YouTube, even though you'd have to watch for hours to figure out who they were, and geolocating.
[00:36:27.593 --> 00:36:32.935]  Ads only popped up in certain areas of the country, so he couldn't find out unless he was in my account, him and Stelter.
[00:36:32.935 --> 00:36:35.856]  And they were, it was in the news, so was Media Matters.
[00:36:35.856 --> 00:36:42.179]  They knew how much I was being paid, they had a whole list of all these sponsors that would opt in to buy into my show.
[00:36:42.179 --> 00:36:45.861]  Oh my gosh, the Pentagon was running Marine Corps and Army ads!
[00:36:45.861 --> 00:36:49.322]  He tattled on that, and boy, they did what General Stelter said.
[00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:52.997]  I'll say that again.
[00:36:52.997 --> 00:37:01.161]  Big Tech has access to everything you do, and they give CNN and the Southern Poverty Law Center and Media Matters access to your private banking information.
[00:37:01.161 --> 00:37:02.381]  It's totally criminal!
[00:37:02.381 --> 00:37:05.142]  But see, Big Tech, oh, they're a private company.
[00:37:05.142 --> 00:37:12.505]  So they can collude with other companies and lie to you and sell your data and do false advertising and tell you to come build up their platform and then pull the rug out from under you.
[00:37:12.505 --> 00:37:14.305]  Then they can call you a Nazi when they ban you.
[00:37:14.305 --> 00:37:18.207]  And then they can tell their users, you don't say their name or we'll kick you off.
[00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:21.191]  No, folks, that's called organized crime.
[00:37:21.191 --> 00:37:32.297]  That's called cult-level, beyond Jim Jones, beyond the Branch Davidians, beyond the Hale-Bopp cult, beyond anything we've ever seen.
[00:37:32.297 --> 00:37:46.144]  Tell it, and if, well, it's a private company, they could tell you, and by the way, I've got all the articles right here, where they admit it, people in a lifetime, prominent journalists, just test it and go, God bless Alex Jones, boom!
[00:37:48.012 --> 00:37:48.853]  Post not allowed.
[00:37:48.853 --> 00:37:50.314]  You're not allowed to say this.
[00:37:50.314 --> 00:37:51.134]  And the people tested it.
[00:37:51.134 --> 00:37:52.776]  It's all over Twitter.
[00:37:52.776 --> 00:37:54.017]  I was like number three on Twitter.
[00:37:54.017 --> 00:37:56.559]  Paul was like number one this weekend.
[00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:59.161]  Laura Loomer and Milo were like right there.
[00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:00.301]  So it's all backfiring.
[00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:04.004]  But people are saying Alex Jones is a scumbag child molester.
[00:38:04.004 --> 00:38:05.025]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:38:05.025 --> 00:38:05.886]  Good job.
[00:38:05.886 --> 00:38:10.509]  They say you're only allowed to say bad things.
[00:38:10.509 --> 00:38:15.113]  And Congress in its addled mindset is asking if this is censorship.
[00:38:18.669 --> 00:38:34.077]  Oh, but don't worry, since you put up with this MasterCard announced last week, they're setting up human rights boards, right out of the Soviet Union, that are going to watch MasterCard users' cards to see where you're shopping, and that they're going to take your card away if you go by from a hate monger.
[00:38:34.077 --> 00:38:35.157]  That means the NRA.
[00:38:35.157 --> 00:38:37.839]  They actually said the NRA.
[00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:40.720]  You try to go join the... Remember California?
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:46.503]  The governor and the city of LA both are trying to get the records of NRA members.
[00:38:48.208 --> 00:38:51.110]  So that you can't have city jobs or work in the city.
[00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.651]  That's right!
[00:38:52.651 --> 00:38:55.613]  If you're an NRA member, you're not gonna be on the police department!
[00:38:55.613 --> 00:38:56.754]  You're like, well that's criminal!
[00:38:56.754 --> 00:38:57.755]  That's discrimination!
[00:38:57.755 --> 00:38:58.195]  Oh no!
[00:38:58.195 --> 00:38:58.836]  L.A.
[00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.277]  is a private company!
[00:39:00.277 --> 00:39:00.897]  No it's not!
[00:39:00.897 --> 00:39:02.718]  It's all a criminal move!
[00:39:02.718 --> 00:39:03.979]  And they're all linked up!
[00:39:03.979 --> 00:39:05.280]  And it makes it racketeering!
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.923]  And they've lied to Congress about the censorship!
[00:39:08.923 --> 00:39:14.807]  They are slapping us in the face, crapping on us, rubbing it in, nothing... 1984 didn't go this far!
[00:39:16.568 --> 00:39:25.478]  Oh, but Ben Shapiro went on Brian Stelter's show and said the band of me is good and that it's a private company.
[00:39:25.478 --> 00:39:29.904]  Old Benny boy knows how to stay on air, doesn't he?
[00:39:29.904 --> 00:39:32.647]  Old Benny boy still saying Russiagate's real.
[00:39:32.647 --> 00:39:36.011]  What a good conservative leader that they force feed to us.
[00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:39.549]  He syndicated 600 radio stations like that!
[00:39:39.549 --> 00:39:41.070]  Dun dun dun dun!
[00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:42.311]  Force-fed by Google!
[00:39:42.311 --> 00:39:46.413]  Oh, all the white supremacists, they're all monetized, funded!
[00:39:46.413 --> 00:39:49.315]  People that say they love Hitler are attacking me every day!
[00:39:49.315 --> 00:39:50.516]  Millions of views!
[00:39:50.516 --> 00:39:51.297]  Oh!
[00:39:51.297 --> 00:39:51.597]  Oh!
[00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:53.258]  Google's like, money machines!
[00:39:53.258 --> 00:39:55.360]  Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom!
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.941]  Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam!
[00:39:57.705 --> 00:39:59.066]  Because they're dividing the country.
[00:39:59.066 --> 00:40:01.847]  Trump tries to unify it with Kanye and everybody else.
[00:40:01.847 --> 00:40:03.148]  He's a Nazi!
[00:40:03.148 --> 00:40:07.890]  Yeah, the guy that bought up all the white supremacist golf courses and let everybody come on it.
[00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:08.971]  Jews, blacks, you name it.
[00:40:08.971 --> 00:40:14.393]  This is a load of crap.
[00:40:14.393 --> 00:40:15.954]  Said I'd be calm about this.
[00:40:15.954 --> 00:40:18.515]  You're probably a new listener.
[00:40:18.515 --> 00:40:20.236]  And you're told the ugly thing Alex Jones says.
[00:40:20.236 --> 00:40:22.778]  Here is a stack of articles.
[00:40:22.778 --> 00:40:23.398]  Here's the Atlantic.
[00:40:25.717 --> 00:40:34.202]  With the actual email from Facebook, their press release, and it says right here, InfoWars is subject to the strictest ban.
[00:40:34.202 --> 00:40:42.747]  Facebook and Instagram will remove any content containing InfoWars videos, radio segments, or articles unless the post is explicitly condemning the content.
[00:40:42.747 --> 00:40:50.491]  And Facebook will also remove any groups set up to share InfoWars content and events promoting any of the banned extremist figures, according to a company spokesperson.
[00:40:56.147 --> 00:41:08.554]  That's AI coming in to your browsing, and what you're doing, and telling you what you can say in live time.
[00:41:08.554 --> 00:41:24.744]  A computer over your shoulder, and in case the computer can't catch satire or whatever, they have 20,000 Southern Poverty Law Center trained people, criminal organization, offshore, literal communist group, that will go and look and see if it's sarcastic and decide, because the big joke is, oh well, I condemn
[00:41:26.027 --> 00:41:28.189]  Explicitly condemn Alex Jones.
[00:41:28.189 --> 00:41:31.711]  So people put my articles and videos out and so far the AI doesn't get it.
[00:41:31.711 --> 00:41:37.736]  So there's a bunch of jokes online where it's like all my videos, everybody's watching and they just go, this man is a piece of filth!
[00:41:37.736 --> 00:41:38.577]  This man is garbage!
[00:41:38.577 --> 00:41:40.578]  So everybody, feel free to do it.
[00:41:40.578 --> 00:41:41.679]  I am the devil.
[00:41:41.679 --> 00:41:44.161]  We have to come up with my new gnome diploma.
[00:41:44.161 --> 00:41:46.363]  You know, a new code name for me.
[00:41:46.363 --> 00:41:47.884]  Spartacus 76?
[00:41:47.884 --> 00:41:48.965]  Who knows what we should do?
[00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:50.025]  Mr. 1776?
[00:41:50.025 --> 00:41:50.326]  I don't know.
[00:41:52.762 --> 00:41:57.384]  But, you know, and then they'll say, oh, they're getting around the ban with a code name.
[00:41:57.384 --> 00:42:05.949]  We won't let those Americans or the other 1,900,000,000 people that aren't in the U.S.
[00:42:05.949 --> 00:42:07.269]  that are on Facebook.
[00:42:07.269 --> 00:42:09.911]  We're watching you too, and you too could get banned.
[00:42:09.911 --> 00:42:11.452]  You too could get listed as an extremist.
[00:42:11.452 --> 00:42:11.932]  Oh, but don't worry.
[00:42:12.935 --> 00:42:13.656]  It's already in place.
[00:42:13.656 --> 00:42:16.498]  I told you six months ago that starting now, it's in place.
[00:42:16.498 --> 00:42:24.043]  Microsoft and others are now officially putting it out with a thing called NewsGuard, run by neocons who bragged, how did I know six months ago?
[00:42:24.043 --> 00:42:24.844]  Did I have a crystal ball?
[00:42:25.711 --> 00:42:26.392]  No, no, no!
[00:42:26.392 --> 00:42:34.178]  They were at a big NATO conference in Germany, and they have these big neocons that work for George W. Bush, saying, oh, you've seen nothing yet.
[00:42:34.178 --> 00:42:35.699]  We're gonna ban everybody.
[00:42:35.699 --> 00:42:37.420]  All the Trump supporters, everybody.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.143]  We've got AI going in, and we've got access to everybody's phones.
[00:42:41.143 --> 00:42:44.465]  We're gonna watch what people are doing in live time on their phones.
[00:42:44.465 --> 00:42:45.566]  That's what NewsGuard does.
[00:42:45.566 --> 00:42:47.328]  They're on your phone!
[00:42:47.328 --> 00:42:48.949]  And they tell you what you can look at.
[00:42:48.949 --> 00:42:52.452]  In your phone, watching you surf, putting up messages and warning you.
[00:42:53.366 --> 00:42:54.687]  Oh, but this is a private company!
[00:42:54.687 --> 00:42:59.711]  You buy this phone, they got spies beyond the NSA jacked into it!
[00:42:59.711 --> 00:43:08.997]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[00:43:08.997 --> 00:43:11.859]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[00:43:11.859 --> 00:43:17.904]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[00:43:18.584 --> 00:43:24.828]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[00:43:24.828 --> 00:43:31.111]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[00:43:31.111 --> 00:43:38.055]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[00:43:39.196 --> 00:43:52.222]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[00:43:52.222 --> 00:43:56.484]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[00:43:56.484 --> 00:43:59.966]  X3, now available at mfulworthslife.com.
[00:43:59.966 --> 00:44:03.027]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[00:44:03.027 --> 00:44:04.588]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.952 --> 00:44:08.918]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:44:08.918 --> 00:44:12.968]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[00:44:14.522 --> 00:44:23.666]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:44:23.666 --> 00:44:29.028]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[00:44:29.028 --> 00:44:31.309]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:34.810]  MFORESTORE.com on MFORESELECT storable foods.
[00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.291]  They've got special diet foods.
[00:44:36.291 --> 00:44:40.273]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[00:44:40.273 --> 00:44:42.493]  They've got so many great products there.
[00:44:42.493 --> 00:44:43.574]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[00:44:44.034 --> 00:44:46.037]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:44:46.037 --> 00:44:48.541]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:53.569]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:58.958]  InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWars Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:45:00.003 --> 00:45:03.606]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:45:03.606 --> 00:45:05.368]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:45:05.368 --> 00:45:17.438]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:45:17.438 --> 00:45:22.722]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs, it
[00:45:23.202 --> 00:45:32.387]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:45:32.387 --> 00:45:37.670]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:40.271]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:45:40.271 --> 00:45:41.992]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:45:41.992 --> 00:45:51.397]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:45:51.977 --> 00:45:54.624]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:45:54.624 --> 00:45:59.357]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:46:00.734 --> 00:46:08.098]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:11.180]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:15.482]  But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:46:15.482 --> 00:46:16.963]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:46:16.963 --> 00:46:23.447]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.948]  So remember, you are the InfoWar.
[00:46:25.948 --> 00:46:27.749]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[00:46:27.749 --> 00:46:29.330]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:35.113]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:46:35.113 --> 00:46:42.858]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:46:42.858 --> 00:46:45.700]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:50.603]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.

[00:46:55.887 --> 00:46:56.327]  God bless you.
[00:47:03.192 --> 00:47:11.180]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:15.004]  We're all living in America!
[00:47:15.004 --> 00:47:16.806]  America!
[00:47:16.806 --> 00:47:18.908]  It's wunderbar!
[00:47:18.908 --> 00:47:21.911]  We're all living in America!
[00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:37.440]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.360]  We're live here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.641]  to 3 p.m., and I come back Sunday live as well, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:45.061]  We have David Knight, who did a great job with the David Knight Show, 8 a.m.
[00:47:45.061 --> 00:47:46.222]  weekday mornings.
[00:47:46.222 --> 00:47:51.323]  We have Owen Schroer with the War Room that's on 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:47:51.323 --> 00:47:51.583]  Central.
[00:47:51.583 --> 00:47:52.723]  We're trying to add more shows soon.
[00:47:52.723 --> 00:47:54.104]  We'll be announcing, hopefully.
[00:47:54.104 --> 00:47:58.705]  But separately, remember, we're on hundreds of radio stations.
[00:47:58.705 --> 00:48:01.386]  We're on hundreds of TV stations and cable stations.
[00:48:01.386 --> 00:48:02.646]  Some big cities, some small towns.
[00:48:03.476 --> 00:48:06.078]  But you look in the media, they go, Jones is off the air!
[00:48:06.078 --> 00:48:06.998]  He's defeated!
[00:48:06.998 --> 00:48:07.839]  What about websites?
[00:48:07.839 --> 00:48:09.240]  What about Infowars.com?
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.781]  What about Newswars.com?
[00:48:10.781 --> 00:48:12.442]  And I get blown away from D.C.
[00:48:12.442 --> 00:48:13.422]  to Austin, Texas, to everywhere.
[00:48:13.422 --> 00:48:15.884]  People go, man, we used to love your show on iTunes.
[00:48:15.884 --> 00:48:17.905]  I was subscribed for a decade.
[00:48:17.905 --> 00:48:18.966]  I used to watch you on YouTube.
[00:48:18.966 --> 00:48:19.686]  Man, I miss your show.
[00:48:19.686 --> 00:48:25.210]  And I'm like, I know you're smarter than the average libtard, but you know Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:27.071]  We've always had our own audio and videos.
[00:48:28.055 --> 00:48:30.238]  We just had trouble paying for the bandwidth.
[00:48:30.238 --> 00:48:33.082]  Hell, I was streaming my TV show 16, 17 years ago.
[00:48:33.082 --> 00:48:38.589]  I was the first to simulcast radio with an actual TV format, not just a webcam.
[00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:40.892]  And I'm not bragging about that, but we've innovated.
[00:48:40.892 --> 00:48:41.293]  But it's you...
[00:48:43.035 --> 00:48:47.938]  Human intelligence overriding Zuckerberg and its people on Facebook.
[00:48:47.938 --> 00:48:52.882]  How dare him tell 2.2 billion people, you won't say Alex Jones' name.
[00:48:52.882 --> 00:48:54.283]  That is cult level.
[00:48:54.283 --> 00:48:57.845]  And then you add the university discrimination.
[00:48:57.845 --> 00:49:07.292]  And you add all the anti-free speech there, and the discrimination against jobs, and the Antifa attacking people, and Democrat leaders saying, run conservatives out of gas stations and shopping malls.
[00:49:08.965 --> 00:49:11.410]  Restaurants and all of this and it's all over the world.
[00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:19.346]  The EU is arresting people that criticize radical Islam or talk about any basic stuff that's going on.
[00:49:20.908 --> 00:49:38.677]  And then they sit back and they say, oh no, no, it's a private company, working with other companies to target certain groups, lying to Congress about the censorship, and then internal documents, Facebook, Google saying, we'll deliver the next election to the Democrats, and that's why they're doing this, and the Project Veritas videos and all of it.
[00:49:38.677 --> 00:49:40.478]  This is the fight for this whole country.
[00:49:41.058 --> 00:49:44.262]  The fight is against China and big tech together against us.
[00:49:44.262 --> 00:49:45.624]  Hillary's even said that.
[00:49:45.624 --> 00:49:54.315]  Will Johnson, talk show host, patriot, UnitedAmericaFirst.com, great guy, does some reports for us as an auxiliary reporter, contract reporter.
[00:49:54.315 --> 00:49:55.917]  You're here in Austin Business the next few days.
[00:49:55.917 --> 00:49:56.878]  You'll be sitting in some with us.
[00:49:56.878 --> 00:49:58.220]  We've got Millie Weaver and...
[00:49:59.381 --> 00:50:05.887]  Others popping in, Caitlyn Bennett and all the demonization attacks they've been under, because they're effectively getting the word out.
[00:50:05.887 --> 00:50:17.358]  And the next hour with us as well, I want to get to a bunch of clips and Brian Stelter saying furious Trump, says he's furious that Trump is now the InfoWars president and putting out a bunch of disinfo.
[00:50:17.358 --> 00:50:19.380]  This is a guy with 100,000 viewers.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.762]  This is a guy that sets himself up as the policeman of the world.
[00:50:22.763 --> 00:50:27.866]  Saying he's for free speech, saying Trump's attacking their speech by criticizing them when they want us off the air.
[00:50:27.866 --> 00:50:28.807]  It's insane.
[00:50:28.807 --> 00:50:29.827]  It is insane.
[00:50:29.827 --> 00:50:33.509]  If anything, he should be fighting to keep you on the air.
[00:50:33.509 --> 00:50:35.430]  This is free speech we're talking about.
[00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:41.874]  They are attacking Americans because they don't want Americans to say what they are not programmed to say.
[00:50:41.874 --> 00:50:46.437]  And it's just like you said, now if you go on a social media and you see Alex Jones that you're subject to be banned,
[00:50:47.137 --> 00:50:47.897]  What is that?
[00:50:47.897 --> 00:50:50.319]  They're giving your name power!
[00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:51.919]  That's exactly what that is!
[00:50:51.919 --> 00:50:53.800]  And it's all going to backfire on them.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:51:01.144]  I agree with you, but Zuckerberg has 76 billion, he's 34 years old, he sounds insane in the speech we're going to play next hour, where he announced all this.
[00:51:01.144 --> 00:51:04.665]  He believes he can override humanity and history.
[00:51:04.665 --> 00:51:05.706]  I believe that too.
[00:51:05.706 --> 00:51:08.888]  I believe he's trying, I believe that he believes he can.
[00:51:08.888 --> 00:51:13.830]  I mean, I saw the George Soros video where George Soros believed that Mark Zuckerberg believes he's a guy.
[00:51:15.427 --> 00:51:16.588]  With the rest of the social media.
[00:51:16.588 --> 00:51:17.908]  They believe that they're guys.
[00:51:17.908 --> 00:51:20.350]  They believe that they control thought.
[00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:22.491]  They control the reality.
[00:51:22.491 --> 00:51:24.352]  They control the narrative.
[00:51:24.352 --> 00:51:25.512]  They believe this.
[00:51:25.512 --> 00:51:27.053]  They truly believe this.
[00:51:27.053 --> 00:51:28.554]  It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[00:51:28.554 --> 00:51:30.755]  You're a smart guy.
[00:51:30.755 --> 00:51:33.276]  You've made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[00:51:33.276 --> 00:51:38.519]  Obviously, they put out in the news before they banned us why they're mad, CNN and others, instead of Brian Stelter.
[00:51:38.519 --> 00:51:42.301]  They said, turning point, the CIA produced The Exorcist.
[00:51:42.301 --> 00:51:43.682]  I went and saw the director of it.
[00:51:44.727 --> 00:51:45.808]  Who also produced it.
[00:51:45.808 --> 00:51:47.589]  He was CIA psychological warfare.
[00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:55.173]  He admitted he used CIA training in it and that it was designed to quote, be a turning point to bring in more deviant art and things.
[00:51:55.173 --> 00:51:56.314]  I'm not saying censor him.
[00:51:56.314 --> 00:51:59.716]  I went and saw him speak at Alamo Draft House like 18 years ago.
[00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:01.277]  They said that was fake news.
[00:52:01.277 --> 00:52:05.399]  Also said Biden had two brain surgeries and looked like he's had another stroke slurring his words.
[00:52:05.399 --> 00:52:07.961]  He did have two brain surgeries.
[00:52:07.961 --> 00:52:10.382]  How is that not fair game?
[00:52:10.382 --> 00:52:10.943]  You know what?
[00:52:10.943 --> 00:52:11.903]  That's a very good question.
[00:52:11.903 --> 00:52:13.204]  How is it not fair game?
[00:52:13.204 --> 00:52:14.025]  They don't care.
[00:52:15.034 --> 00:52:16.255]  I mean, ultimately, they don't care.
[00:52:16.255 --> 00:52:20.817]  Unless it's something that they're pushing, unless it's the agenda that they have, they don't care.
[00:52:20.817 --> 00:52:23.178]  Everything else, nothing else matters to them.
[00:52:23.178 --> 00:52:24.759]  They have to control.
[00:52:24.759 --> 00:52:25.819]  It's about control.
[00:52:25.819 --> 00:52:27.500]  It's controlling all of us.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.681]  And if they can't control all of us, then what?
[00:52:29.681 --> 00:52:34.523]  I mean, the 2016 election is a primary example of them losing control.
[00:52:34.523 --> 00:52:35.844]  They could not control the narrative.
[00:52:35.844 --> 00:52:38.505]  They said, all the polls, President Trump is going to win.
[00:52:38.505 --> 00:52:39.646]  You can't stop it.
[00:52:39.646 --> 00:52:40.746]  You can't stop it.
[00:52:40.746 --> 00:52:43.107]  President Trump's not going to win because Hillary's in the polls.
[00:52:43.107 --> 00:52:43.988]  She's going to be the winner.
[00:52:44.688 --> 00:52:47.949]  By the way, there's the Washingtonian with the director.
[00:52:47.949 --> 00:52:49.469]  Think the Exodus was just a horror movie?
[00:52:49.469 --> 00:52:50.930]  The author says you're wrong.
[00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:52.050]  Control F.C.I.A.
[00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:53.490]  I never even read the article.
[00:52:53.490 --> 00:52:54.531]  I saw him say it!
[00:52:54.531 --> 00:52:55.371]  And I looked it up!
[00:52:55.371 --> 00:52:57.531]  He was a high-level operative!
[00:52:57.531 --> 00:52:58.992]  And the CIA helped produce it!
[00:52:58.992 --> 00:53:00.212]  I saw him say it!
[00:53:00.212 --> 00:53:02.353]  But they say I'm lying!
[00:53:02.353 --> 00:53:02.773]  Of course.
[00:53:03.775 --> 00:53:05.016]  Of course, but that's their motive.
[00:53:05.016 --> 00:53:06.378]  They have to say you're lying.
[00:53:06.378 --> 00:53:09.181]  Even when you say the sky is blue, you're lying.
[00:53:09.181 --> 00:53:22.155]  Even when they come out and they show tangible proof that you are telling the truth, they still have to come out and say that you're lying, because if they can't control the way people think, if they can't control the narrative, then they're losing.
[00:53:22.155 --> 00:53:23.837]  And they see that, constantly.
[00:53:23.837 --> 00:53:25.158]  So of course they have to change it.
[00:53:25.899 --> 00:53:28.380]  I mean, what else can you expect from them?
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:30.340]  I mean, should we expect anything else from them?
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:36.822]  If they're going to constantly push out the lies and tell us that, hey, you know, Alex Jones, he's a monster.
[00:53:36.822 --> 00:53:38.102]  He's going after people.
[00:53:38.102 --> 00:53:39.942]  He's done this and he's done that.
[00:53:39.942 --> 00:53:44.644]  And then people start believing because a lot of people don't go out and they don't research the truth for themselves.
[00:53:44.644 --> 00:53:47.724]  And if they don't research it, that's what they're going to believe.
[00:53:47.724 --> 00:53:49.805]  And they have done it very well.
[00:53:50.385 --> 00:54:05.973]  The liberal media, they've all attacked so many people to get people to believe that, hey, this subject here, I mean, like I was saying on the 2016, when they were telling everyone that Hillary Clinton was in the polls, she was 99%, no way that she could lose, and then the American people stood up.
[00:54:05.973 --> 00:54:07.614]  The American people showed up.
[00:54:07.614 --> 00:54:09.535]  And then, now they have to blame Russia.
[00:54:09.535 --> 00:54:10.496]  Because why?
[00:54:10.496 --> 00:54:12.617]  Because the American people are not dumb.
[00:54:12.617 --> 00:54:14.558]  They truly believe the American people are dumb.
[00:54:14.558 --> 00:54:16.579]  So if you do something and you say something,
[00:54:17.406 --> 00:54:20.688]  That they don't agree with, what's the best thing they can do?
[00:54:20.688 --> 00:54:21.749]  Lie.
[00:54:21.749 --> 00:54:22.329]  Constantly lie.
[00:54:22.329 --> 00:54:25.010]  And now they need us off the air so they can lie with impunity.
[00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:25.791]  The outrageousness.
[00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:27.172]  Look at these headlines.
[00:54:27.172 --> 00:54:28.572]  Washington Post, you name it.
[00:54:28.572 --> 00:54:30.313]  Facebook bans anti-Semites.
[00:54:30.313 --> 00:54:31.594]  NPR, same headline.
[00:54:31.594 --> 00:54:34.316]  And then it says, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:54:34.316 --> 00:54:37.117]  Paul is getting lawyers he is going to sue.
[00:54:37.117 --> 00:54:41.360]  We're trying to raise the money to make sure we can do it, but my God, people say, oh, we'll just take it.
[00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:46.502]  There are a lot of crazies that try to literally attack me on the street screaming I'm Hitler or I'm a Russian agent.
[00:54:46.502 --> 00:54:49.463]  This is dangerous when there's no proof of that.
[00:54:49.463 --> 00:54:50.444]  This is crazy.
[00:54:50.444 --> 00:54:52.444]  Well, it's the same thing to go along with.
[00:54:52.444 --> 00:54:57.006]  They always try to say that white people, white supremacists are on the uprise or attacking people.
[00:54:57.006 --> 00:54:59.427]  They're trying to take over, but they have no footage of it.
[00:54:59.427 --> 00:55:03.609]  Now I can show you footage of Antifa, BLM and BAM attacking conservatives at their rally.
[00:55:03.609 --> 00:55:05.590]  All over the country on May Day.
[00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:07.051]  Someone's walking around with a Trump hat.
[00:55:07.051 --> 00:55:07.731]  They get attacked.
[00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:11.494]  But you can't show Trump supporters going out attacking people at these rallies.
[00:55:11.494 --> 00:55:19.021]  You can't show Trump supporters deliberately attacking someone because they- Well, you're from Arkansas, one of the strongest places for the KKK, and I'm sure you ran into a little bit of racism or something.
[00:55:19.021 --> 00:55:21.203]  I mean, I saw some in East Texas growing up, and not a lot.
[00:55:21.203 --> 00:55:24.385]  It was always white trash that were into it, but I mean, did you have a bunch of racism problems?
[00:55:24.385 --> 00:55:24.766]  Oh, no!
[00:55:25.166 --> 00:55:28.507]  No, I didn't have a racism problem until I became a conservative.
[00:55:28.507 --> 00:55:30.568]  That's what I was about to say.
[00:55:30.568 --> 00:55:33.408]  My dad, his dad, he lives in KKK in East Texas.
[00:55:33.408 --> 00:55:34.549]  My dad said that wasn't a big deal.
[00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:35.329]  They were all losers.
[00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:37.610]  By standing up to them, we just told them to go to hell.
[00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:38.710]  It was no big deal.
[00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:40.710]  Like somebody yelling at you in a parking lot.
[00:55:42.851 --> 00:55:47.032]  You know, before Obama, we knew that there was racism.
[00:55:47.032 --> 00:55:49.193]  We knew that there was the right KKK out there.
[00:55:49.193 --> 00:55:50.633]  Okay, we all knew that, but you know what?
[00:55:50.633 --> 00:55:52.093]  We just acknowledged it.
[00:55:52.093 --> 00:55:56.475]  They weren't going around trying to kill people, not the way the media is portraying it today.
[00:55:56.475 --> 00:55:58.455]  Even right now, they don't have the footage to show it.
[00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:05.137]  The KKK was powerful when David Rockefeller's father and the Department of Education and the federal government funded him for about 10 years in the 30s.
[00:56:06.377 --> 00:56:07.858]  As a national movement for eugenics.
[00:56:07.858 --> 00:56:09.999]  And then Hitler embarrassed them and then they weren't big.
[00:56:09.999 --> 00:56:10.280]  Yeah.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:10.800]  That's it.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.601]  When the Democrats funded them, they were big.
[00:56:12.601 --> 00:56:13.061]  That's it.
[00:56:13.061 --> 00:56:13.642]  Exactly.
[00:56:13.642 --> 00:56:15.863]  And now the Democrats are trying to fund them again.
[00:56:15.863 --> 00:56:16.804]  Trying to bring them back to light.
[00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:19.011]  And then saying we are.
[00:56:19.011 --> 00:56:19.651]  Yeah.
[00:56:19.651 --> 00:56:22.514]  And they say, or I'm a neo-Nazi sympathizer.
[00:56:22.514 --> 00:56:22.974]  I've seen that.
[00:56:22.974 --> 00:56:24.615]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:56:24.615 --> 00:56:26.777]  I mean, that's dumb!
[00:56:26.777 --> 00:56:27.498]  Why would I do that?
[00:56:27.498 --> 00:56:29.059]  They said Candace Owens loves Hitler!
[00:56:29.059 --> 00:56:29.659]  Yes!
[00:56:29.659 --> 00:56:30.500]  Totally made up.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.321]  Yes, because she made a statement.
[00:56:32.321 --> 00:56:37.425]  She talked about his ideas, what he was trying to do, nationalize the country, because he's a nationalist.
[00:56:37.425 --> 00:56:39.267]  There's nothing wrong with being a nationalist.
[00:56:39.767 --> 00:56:42.650]  But when you try to... But she said then he invaded other countries, he was in love with them.
[00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:43.170]  Of course.
[00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:45.712]  She was talking about policy like a real person does.
[00:56:45.712 --> 00:56:46.533]  Of course.
[00:56:46.533 --> 00:56:50.236]  Like Hitler built the major highways that we copied, and the space program.
[00:56:50.236 --> 00:56:51.637]  Does it mean he's a good guy?
[00:56:51.637 --> 00:56:52.758]  No, of course not.
[00:56:52.758 --> 00:56:53.439]  But you know what?
[00:56:53.439 --> 00:56:56.161]  Just because you do something wrong doesn't mean you're a bad guy either.
[00:56:56.161 --> 00:56:57.542]  We all make mistakes.
[00:56:57.542 --> 00:56:58.023]  You know?
[00:56:58.023 --> 00:57:02.867]  But they take anything that we do as conservative Christians, and you do that one thing.
[00:57:02.867 --> 00:57:04.408]  You do that one thing, and that's it.
[00:57:04.408 --> 00:57:05.309]  They try to crush you.
[00:57:05.649 --> 00:57:07.571]  Meanwhile, they lie about WMDs.
[00:57:07.571 --> 00:57:15.660]  I have the WikiLeaks right here, one of the famous ones I'm going to show later, where the top professor is talking to Hillary and talking to Podesta and he says it's time for race war.
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.622]  He says the public doesn't listen to us anymore.
[00:57:17.622 --> 00:57:21.006]  We need to create cultural war and turn people against each other, which has already been going on.
[00:57:21.006 --> 00:57:22.848]  He says we've already been doing it, but not enough.
[00:57:24.218 --> 00:57:29.340]  We've got to get to Brian Stelter, says he's furious Trump is now the InfoWars president.
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.581]  Talk about a condescending, arrogant person who's not self-aware.
[00:57:32.581 --> 00:57:34.222]  That's all coming up.
[00:57:34.222 --> 00:57:36.543]  And what this signifies, the deep state's making their move.
[00:57:36.543 --> 00:57:38.403]  It's not just going to be Facebook.
[00:57:38.403 --> 00:57:43.765]  AI now is going to be in your phone, controlling what you can visit, what you can do, and reporting back on you.
[00:57:43.765 --> 00:57:45.486]  Microsoft and others have announced it.
[00:57:45.486 --> 00:57:47.407]  We must have congressional investigations.
[00:57:47.407 --> 00:57:48.227]  It must stop now.

[00:58:37.067 --> 00:58:38.588]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.588 --> 00:58:40.069]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:46.754]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[00:59:53.214 --> 01:00:10.399]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:14.820]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.261]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.692 --> 01:00:20.593]  So, I could see what tyrants would do.
[01:00:20.593 --> 01:00:23.155]  As Thomas Jefferson said, he was asked, what is the limit of tyrants?
[01:00:23.155 --> 01:00:24.816]  He said, whatever you'll put up with.
[01:00:24.816 --> 01:00:27.118]  Whatever you'll accept as the limit is the quote.
[01:00:27.118 --> 01:00:33.902]  So I remember being at the mall, like 10 years ago, and my ex-wife had her new iPhone when they first come out.
[01:00:33.902 --> 01:00:36.984]  Seems like they've always been here, but it's 10 years ago or so.
[01:00:36.984 --> 01:00:39.226]  And there's a song, and she wants to know what it is.
[01:00:39.226 --> 01:00:42.027]  So she hits this app called Shazam.
[01:00:42.027 --> 01:00:43.749]  She holds it up in like 30 seconds.
[01:00:43.749 --> 01:00:45.670]  She knows what it was.
[01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:47.311]  And I was like, I remember thinking right then,
[01:00:48.769 --> 01:01:03.059]  And I remember looking over at my six-year-old son and saying, Rex, I guarantee in 10, 20 years, they'll be able to find somebody's voice, voice print it, and have a program that goes out and bands that voice across the internet at one time.
[01:01:03.059 --> 01:01:04.680]  And I said, they'll do it through cloud computing.
[01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:05.701]  Cloud was just being pushed.
[01:01:05.701 --> 01:01:09.844]  That's why they don't want you to have it natively with yourself, like your records or whatever.
[01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:16.670]  They want it all up there on the cloud so they can get in it, abuse you, mine it, do whatever you want to you.
[01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:24.699]  And now they've announced NewsGuard and neocon groups and let this groups are going to be Southern Poverty Law Center in your phone reading and watching what you do.
[01:01:24.699 --> 01:01:28.142]  It's been announced and they've got to introduce it now, though.
[01:01:28.142 --> 01:01:28.363]  So.
[01:01:29.884 --> 01:01:35.945]  Oliver Darcy, who is literally the anti-free speech police officer, so on Facebook's profile says he's a free speech defender.
[01:01:35.945 --> 01:01:40.326]  Everything, remember, with him is about insulting you, gaslighting you, killing logic.
[01:01:40.326 --> 01:01:45.527]  He says, we're looking to see, that's my private phone, which I know isn't.
[01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:54.229]  We're looking with the company to see if Jones has an app where you can make digital phone calls and text messages.
[01:01:54.229 --> 01:01:57.650]  So the New York Post had the headline, should Alex Jones be allowed to use the telephone?
[01:01:58.615 --> 01:02:00.816]  Laura Loomer just had her Uber Eats taken away.
[01:02:00.816 --> 01:02:02.757]  She's had all of her travel stuff taken away.
[01:02:02.757 --> 01:02:07.700]  She's been banned by a bunch of different major groups.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.661]  Oh, I've had one of those moments.
[01:02:10.661 --> 01:02:11.401]  I'm teleprompter free.
[01:02:11.401 --> 01:02:16.284]  Will, what's the name of the... There's a bunch of them where you book people's houses, like hotels.
[01:02:16.284 --> 01:02:18.766]  It's based here in Austin.
[01:02:18.766 --> 01:02:20.147]  Airbnb banned her.
[01:02:20.147 --> 01:02:22.308]  So they're going through their database.
[01:02:22.308 --> 01:02:22.908]  Well, let me see.
[01:02:22.908 --> 01:02:24.209]  Laura Loomer, I saw her on the news.
[01:02:24.209 --> 01:02:26.731]  She's protesting being banned on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:02:26.731 --> 01:02:29.132]  Let me just go over there and ban her from getting an Uber.
[01:02:29.132 --> 01:02:30.173]  She's banned on Uber.
[01:02:30.173 --> 01:02:31.233]  She's banned on Airbnb.
[01:02:31.233 --> 01:02:33.895]  And now she's banned from ordering food on her phone.
[01:02:33.895 --> 01:02:34.916]  And she's starting to freak out.
[01:02:34.916 --> 01:02:36.457]  And they go, oh, look at that girl, bitchin'.
[01:02:37.197 --> 01:02:39.558]  You just shut up, honey cake, go ahead.
[01:02:39.558 --> 01:02:41.818]  How do you, how do you live?
[01:02:41.818 --> 01:02:43.679]  How do you live in all of this?
[01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:45.660]  I mean, they're, I mean... But they're private companies!
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.581]  Yeah, but they're private companies, even on top of that... All working together to deny you the lunch counter.
[01:02:50.581 --> 01:02:53.722]  Yes, they, on top of that, they take your bank accounts away.
[01:02:53.722 --> 01:02:55.883]  They don't want you to even buy milk.
[01:02:55.883 --> 01:02:58.083]  You can't even keep lights on for your home.
[01:02:58.083 --> 01:02:59.844]  What do they think is going to happen?
[01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:03.045]  It's a social, this is the way I see it, it's a social programming.
[01:03:03.445 --> 01:03:08.049]  It's a program to try to push people over the edge to get you to go out and be violent.
[01:03:08.049 --> 01:03:08.550]  That's what it is.
[01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:09.230]  They're pushing a revolt.
[01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:10.051]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:03:10.051 --> 01:03:14.655]  Yes, they want people to be violent, and they're going to keep doing it until they get what they want.
[01:03:14.655 --> 01:03:18.499]  Like I said earlier, they don't have footage of conservatives going out being crazy.
[01:03:18.499 --> 01:03:24.944]  They need that, because they need that to convince liberals that conservatives are being violent.
[01:03:24.944 --> 01:03:28.548]  If they don't have it, then they can't get more liberals to go out and be violent.
[01:03:28.548 --> 01:03:29.469]  But that's the goal here.
[01:03:30.089 --> 01:03:35.557]  To manipulate people to the point to where they have to go out and fight for their only existence.
[01:03:35.557 --> 01:03:35.997]  That's the plan.
[01:03:35.997 --> 01:03:37.139]  For their survival.
[01:03:37.139 --> 01:03:38.701]  People are having to fight for it.
[01:03:38.701 --> 01:03:42.426]  And if you can't live and you can't survive, what do you think people are gonna do?
[01:03:42.426 --> 01:03:43.547]  Look at Venezuela.
[01:03:43.547 --> 01:03:45.170]  People are out in the streets right now.
[01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:46.151]  That's what the liberals want.
[01:03:46.371 --> 01:03:49.352]  They want what's happening in Venezuela to happen here in America.
[01:03:49.352 --> 01:03:51.633]  They want people at each other's throats.
[01:03:51.633 --> 01:03:55.035]  They want people to just destroy people and even get to cannibalism.
[01:03:55.035 --> 01:03:56.616]  They want us killing each other.
[01:03:56.616 --> 01:04:04.319]  And that's in the IMF World Bank documents that got released like 15, 16 years ago by an investigative journalist who's actually a liberal.
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.521]  Greg Pallast.
[01:04:07.521 --> 01:04:12.283]  And it was in their internal documents that got leaked by the economic hitman.
[01:04:12.283 --> 01:04:13.804]  Perkins was part of that.
[01:04:13.804 --> 01:04:20.728]  It was in those documents that they called the IMF riot, where they create the climate to have a year of riot, then they buy everything up for pennies on the dollar.
[01:04:20.728 --> 01:04:27.172]  Since I mentioned Darcy saying it, here he is calling for me to have digital phone usage taken, and he's in my damn phone.
[01:04:27.172 --> 01:04:27.452]  Here it is.
[01:04:28.032 --> 01:04:44.663]  Yes, Facebook obviously owns Instagram, and so someone like Alex Jones, who had been banned from Facebook a while back, last year in the summer, but he was still having a presence on Instagram, and that had drawn a lot of scrutiny from people who were saying, hey, you know, you guys banned him from one of your platforms, why are you allowing him to have a presence on Instagram?
[01:04:44.663 --> 01:04:53.229]  And so, yes, now Facebook is going to be banning Alex Jones and InfoWars from not only their main platform, Facebook, but also from Instagram.
[01:04:53.229 --> 01:04:57.652]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook.
[01:04:59.075 --> 01:05:05.350]  Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[01:05:52.398 --> 01:05:55.080]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:59.192 --> 01:05:59.813]  We've got it.
[01:05:59.813 --> 01:06:06.321]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:06.321 --> 01:06:10.727]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:10.727 --> 01:06:16.374]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:20.567 --> 01:06:24.270]  Investigative Journalist, Talk Show Host, UnitedAmericaFirst.com, Head, Will Johnson.
[01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.691]  Right, shotgun with us.
[01:06:25.691 --> 01:06:26.691]  Will, we're going to play this clip again.
[01:06:26.691 --> 01:06:28.352]  We just played it.
[01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:39.600]  Oliver Darcy, who's the little anti-free speech policeman on CNN with Pumpkinhead, Ryan Stelter, has called for taking phone service away.
[01:06:40.996 --> 01:06:47.257]  Now that Facebook and other big groups are moving into telecom, they can already live time see what you're typing and doing.
[01:06:47.257 --> 01:06:47.857]  And he admits that.
[01:06:47.857 --> 01:06:52.678]  He says, don't let conservatives like Alex Jones have phone service.
[01:06:52.678 --> 01:06:56.159]  And now MasterCard's announcing not just talk show hosts, but conservatives.
[01:06:56.159 --> 01:06:57.539]  They're going to track your purchases.
[01:06:57.539 --> 01:07:03.100]  If you're an NRA member, MasterCard is saying they're creating a human rights board that will now take your credit card away.
[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:03.921]  I'm not kidding.
[01:07:03.921 --> 01:07:05.421]  So we're being put into the digital ghetto.
[01:07:06.804 --> 01:07:09.669]  And the next level is taking you to the death camp, like Matt Grudge said.
[01:07:09.669 --> 01:07:11.372]  This is literally happening.
[01:07:11.372 --> 01:07:12.675]  So, let's play that clip.
[01:07:12.675 --> 01:07:12.995]  Here it is.
[01:07:13.704 --> 01:07:18.568]  I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp, which is also owned by Facebook.
[01:07:18.568 --> 01:07:26.814]  And a spokesperson cannot say immediately because it's, I guess, unclear whether some of these people have WhatsApp accounts, according to the spokesperson.
[01:07:26.814 --> 01:07:27.935]  I played the clip on Thursday.
[01:07:27.935 --> 01:07:28.695]  I played it on Friday.
[01:07:28.695 --> 01:07:30.617]  In the interest of time, I'm not going to play the three-minute clip.
[01:07:30.617 --> 01:07:31.958]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:34.680]  They go all through it and say Jones has been taken off Facebook.
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:36.001]  No one's allowed to say his name.
[01:07:36.761 --> 01:07:44.985]  This is like out of Beyond Orwell, and then he goes on to say, we're looking into it to see if these people, Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, are using this app.
[01:07:44.985 --> 01:07:46.026]  I don't have the app.
[01:07:46.026 --> 01:07:49.148]  But they're scared of it because the Brazilian president got elected.
[01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:50.388]  They have no internet freedom there.
[01:07:50.388 --> 01:07:52.209]  Facebook censors everybody that's in action.
[01:07:52.209 --> 01:07:55.231]  They all use text messages to communicate.
[01:07:55.231 --> 01:07:56.792]  That's what the app is.
[01:07:57.412 --> 01:07:59.876]  And they're trying to say we can't have text messages!
[01:07:59.876 --> 01:08:05.345]  I can't send you a text, or send my son a text, or send my wife a text, or send my crew a text!
[01:08:05.345 --> 01:08:07.187]  They're literally saying take our communications away!
[01:08:07.898 --> 01:08:10.600]  What happens if you need to call 9-1-1?
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:14.664]  They're going to try to make it to where you can only call certain people.
[01:08:14.664 --> 01:08:19.088]  It's just like if you're saying certain things, you can say what they want you to say.
[01:08:19.088 --> 01:08:21.370]  They always talk about Scientology.
[01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:27.255]  Scientology saying if they get mad at you, they tell you to disassociate with your family or whatever it's called.
[01:08:27.255 --> 01:08:28.056]  And that's what cults do.
[01:08:28.656 --> 01:08:51.364]  This is 50 trillion light years worse, saying you can't say Alex Jones's name, and we're going to take conservatives' phone apps away so they can't talk to their family, and now they're not letting Laura Loomer use Uber or use all these other services, Airbnb, and now they banned her using Uber Eats where she can't order food.
[01:08:51.364 --> 01:08:55.466]  You see how they create a digital system, it's all in the cloud, they have your identity, you have no prospects.
[01:08:56.247 --> 01:09:05.340]  No privacy, and now they come in and tell you where you can go and what you can do, and they're watching you in live time with AI and actual minors.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.823]  And who you can talk to, physically.
[01:09:07.823 --> 01:09:09.225]  They're gonna get to that point as well.
[01:09:09.225 --> 01:09:09.445]  Why not?
[01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:11.108]  I mean, they're already- Well, they just said it!
[01:09:11.388 --> 01:09:19.675]  Yeah, so if I want to call, you know, if I want to call and order a pizza, you mean to tell me that I can't call and order a pizza to feed my family?
[01:09:19.675 --> 01:09:23.158]  I can't call my doctor to get my prescription?
[01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:30.945]  Or are they gonna like, maybe they'll get down to, okay well you can call your doctor between this time and this time because we need to regulate how much time you have on the phone.
[01:09:30.945 --> 01:09:36.610]  Or how much, I mean this is insane that we're actually living in a time like this and we're actually having a discussion.
[01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:37.731]  And it's because they got away with it all.
[01:09:38.988 --> 01:09:47.614]  The New York Times illegally got bank account records, and we know how they did it, from five years ago.
[01:09:47.614 --> 01:09:55.320]  It was then used to target five of our merchant accounts and take them, and then they took PayPal away and we got some backups.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:57.122]  But the point is, they're trying to search those out.
[01:09:58.001 --> 01:10:02.424]  They are literally using all these fake lawsuits against us and all that to try to get those.
[01:10:02.424 --> 01:10:05.426]  This is mafia criminal will.
[01:10:05.426 --> 01:10:08.188]  They're saying, you're not going to use the phone if we don't say.
[01:10:08.188 --> 01:10:09.329]  You're not going to get an Uber.
[01:10:09.329 --> 01:10:10.930]  You're not going to get food.
[01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:13.231]  And then the Republicans are like, well, it's a private company.
[01:10:13.231 --> 01:10:19.876]  It's all these big tech Silicon Valley that have moved to China, are helping them oppress their own people, helping them round up their own damn dissidents.
[01:10:20.496 --> 01:10:23.379]  And now they're here at the universities, no free speech.
[01:10:23.379 --> 01:10:24.780]  They're everywhere else, no free speech.
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:26.201]  Antifa's beating everybody up.
[01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:27.563]  They're running people out of restaurants.
[01:10:27.563 --> 01:10:29.004]  They're physically attacking me.
[01:10:29.004 --> 01:10:31.586]  Everybody else, this guy's been attacked.
[01:10:31.586 --> 01:10:35.090]  And they just say, oh, well, it's a private company.
[01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:36.731]  No, it's organized crime.
[01:10:36.731 --> 01:10:42.656]  If Jimmy the Bull or whatever his name was, or John Gotti was doing this, they'd execute him.
[01:10:43.863 --> 01:10:46.246]  The Italian Mafia never thought of stuff like this.
[01:10:46.246 --> 01:10:48.247]  It's extortion, it's fraud, it's criminal.
[01:10:48.247 --> 01:10:50.430]  It's because of the technology today.
[01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:55.555]  Because they can control people because they know everyone has that device in their hand.
[01:10:55.555 --> 01:10:58.998]  The device will tell you how much FaceTime you had on there for the week.
[01:10:58.998 --> 01:11:02.081]  That's right, and it's monitoring your heart rate and what you do without asking.
[01:11:02.081 --> 01:11:05.384]  It knows how fast you're driving and it's reporting it all back to AI Big Brother.
[01:11:05.384 --> 01:11:07.146]  And the truth is, Congress is scared of them.
[01:11:07.626 --> 01:11:09.647]  A bunch of old, scared people.
[01:11:09.647 --> 01:11:10.127]  Well, you know what?
[01:11:10.127 --> 01:11:11.047]  I'm not scared.
[01:11:11.047 --> 01:11:17.309]  I'm not turning my kids over to Zuckerberg, telling me who I can talk to, or people can't say my name, or they'll be banned.
[01:11:17.309 --> 01:11:18.789]  That is a damn cult!
[01:11:18.789 --> 01:11:25.611]  Imagine if you were watching a cult about the Maharishi, you know, out in Oregon, and how he got shut down, and he sounded like probably a bad guy.
[01:11:25.611 --> 01:11:27.192]  He didn't say whose name you could say.
[01:11:27.192 --> 01:11:29.813]  He didn't know how many times you jerked off.
[01:11:29.813 --> 01:11:32.013]  He didn't tell you couldn't buy groceries.
[01:11:32.013 --> 01:11:33.134]  I mean, my God!
[01:11:33.134 --> 01:11:34.514]  I've never heard of a cult like this!
[01:11:34.514 --> 01:11:35.516]  You know what?
[01:11:35.516 --> 01:11:40.870]  Zuckerberg's running a 2.2 billion person cult and telling you what you can and can't say!
[01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:42.425]  Absolutely.
[01:11:42.425 --> 01:11:46.468]  You can't even say in the name of Jesus on Facebook without being subject to being banned.
[01:11:46.468 --> 01:11:47.849]  Oh, everybody gets screenshots.
[01:11:47.849 --> 01:11:48.730]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:55.015]  And people send me messages saying, well, I got banned for saying in the name of Jesus on Facebook because they said they call it hate.
[01:11:55.015 --> 01:11:56.296]  They call it hate.
[01:11:56.296 --> 01:11:56.857]  Really?
[01:11:56.857 --> 01:11:57.858]  That's where we're coming to.
[01:11:57.858 --> 01:11:58.819]  They're attacking you.
[01:11:58.819 --> 01:12:03.703]  Like, I truly believe that they feel that they can attack you and President Trump's not going to do anything about it.
[01:12:03.703 --> 01:12:06.225]  Can you believe a gag ordered 2.2 billion people?
[01:12:08.342 --> 01:12:09.542]  I see it coming.
[01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:10.043]  They told him.
[01:12:10.043 --> 01:12:13.584]  They said 2.2 billion users cannot say Infowars or Alex Jones.
[01:12:13.584 --> 01:12:16.885]  And once they accept that, it'll be more and more names and more and more things.
[01:12:16.885 --> 01:12:19.045]  Like you said, Facebook's already been doing this.
[01:12:19.045 --> 01:12:19.926]  Facebook's already been doing this.
[01:12:19.926 --> 01:12:22.166]  You talk about Benghazi, they ban you.
[01:12:22.166 --> 01:12:23.647]  It's just so criminal.
[01:12:23.647 --> 01:12:25.488]  And then they deny it to Congress.
[01:12:25.488 --> 01:12:26.508]  We've got Millie Weaver.
[01:12:26.508 --> 01:12:27.328]  We've got Kaitlin Bennett.
[01:12:27.328 --> 01:12:28.148]  You're riding shotgun.
[01:12:28.148 --> 01:12:32.930]  You won't believe what's happened to these two young ladies, how they're being demonized and targeted for unpersoning as well.
[01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:35.971]  If you give in to the intimidation and say, well, then I better grovel.
[01:12:36.391 --> 01:12:37.833]  They're gonna move the gold post on you.
[01:12:37.833 --> 01:12:39.575]  That's how cults work.
[01:12:39.575 --> 01:12:43.440]  This is a synthetic, digital AI cult running you with Zuckerberg.
[01:12:44.261 --> 01:12:49.824]  Who looks like a grey alien from Mars or something, up there literally telling you he's going to do this to you.
[01:12:49.824 --> 01:12:52.105]  We must stand against it.
[01:12:52.105 --> 01:12:55.207]  And we must pull out of Facebook, but also have Congress break them up.
[01:12:55.207 --> 01:12:56.068]  They're arrogant.
[01:12:56.068 --> 01:13:02.151]  If the NSA will, did one one millionth of this, and imagine the NSA is going to tell you who you can call.
[01:13:02.151 --> 01:13:04.452]  The NSA is going to cancel you getting food.
[01:13:04.452 --> 01:13:06.333]  The NSA is not going to let you use an Uber.
[01:13:06.333 --> 01:13:08.295]  The NSA is not going to let you say the name Alex Jones.
[01:13:08.295 --> 01:13:10.716]  We'd say arrest the entire NSA and I would!
[01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:20.555]  But instead it's NSA technology given to private companies, they get you to opt in, then they get you totally dependent on it, and then they slam the door like Ted Bundy and you're chained up and they say...
[01:13:21.385 --> 01:13:22.686]  Now you're going to do what I tell you.
[01:13:22.686 --> 01:13:27.590]  You know to go right along with what you're talking about when you brought up how they want to test your heart rate.
[01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:30.433]  The healthcare, the whole thing about the healthcare.
[01:13:30.433 --> 01:13:31.994]  This all ties in together.
[01:13:31.994 --> 01:13:33.355]  It's controlling your blood.
[01:13:33.355 --> 01:13:34.897]  Bloomberg said I'm a technocrat.
[01:13:34.897 --> 01:13:36.958]  He said how much you eat, how much salt.
[01:13:36.958 --> 01:13:38.700]  We're going to track everything you do and tell you what to do.
[01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:39.540]  Yeah, even the healthcare.
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:40.842]  So if you make a phone call.
[01:13:40.842 --> 01:13:41.902]  AOC said stop eating meat.
[01:13:41.902 --> 01:13:46.927]  Yeah, if you make a phone call and you want to order pizza and they say well your cholesterol level was too high this month.
[01:13:47.347 --> 01:13:48.888]  How would they know that information?
[01:13:48.888 --> 01:13:54.753]  The government healthcare is going to track all of that information, and they're going to tell you what you can and when you cannot eat.
[01:13:54.753 --> 01:13:56.034]  And by the way, they're already saying that.
[01:13:56.034 --> 01:13:58.376]  Yeah, it's coming, it's here.
[01:13:58.376 --> 01:14:00.698]  People don't even realize how bad it is.
[01:14:00.698 --> 01:14:04.301]  It's like you're steady saying this stuff, it's like, oh, you're just talking, you're just talking.
[01:14:04.301 --> 01:14:07.644]  But what you're saying is absolutely true, and it's happening today.
[01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:09.185]  And people don't believe it.
[01:14:09.185 --> 01:14:13.789]  Can you believe they've gotten enough deranged from the universities is where they breed all the anti-free speech?
[01:14:14.893 --> 01:14:15.814]  See, oh, it's a private company.
[01:14:15.814 --> 01:14:16.194]  No, it's not.
[01:14:16.194 --> 01:14:17.134]  It's illegal.
[01:14:17.134 --> 01:14:22.097]  They then use them to take over the big tech, and these people will do anything!
[01:14:22.097 --> 01:14:22.837]  Anything!
[01:14:22.837 --> 01:14:25.278]  You know, a lot of people say, well, I have nothing to hide.
[01:14:25.278 --> 01:14:26.599]  I have nothing to hide.
[01:14:26.599 --> 01:14:29.480]  Yeah, your freedom's about to be gone, and you have nothing to hide?
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:35.263]  By the way, it just showed that Nike and Garmin and all of it, you know, when your fitness trainer tells you to wear that little bracelet, they're selling all of it.
[01:14:36.363 --> 01:14:40.407]  We broke in 1996 when an army nurse told us about the secret U.N.
[01:14:40.407 --> 01:14:45.471]  base at Fort Sam Houston that had everybody's blood in the U.S.
[01:14:45.471 --> 01:14:46.872]  and that's why they take baby's blood at birth.
[01:14:46.872 --> 01:14:48.674]  It's not for blood testing, they just do it there.
[01:14:48.674 --> 01:14:56.541]  They send it off and then it was given to big tech companies, biotech, so now people are going to get genetic treatments and they go, sorry, that's $200,000.
[01:14:56.541 --> 01:15:00.124]  We own, every person's different, your original DNA protein code.
[01:15:00.724 --> 01:15:01.445]  And they go, no you don't.
[01:15:01.445 --> 01:15:02.206]  They go, yeah, the U.S.
[01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:03.287]  government gave it to us.
[01:15:03.287 --> 01:15:05.128]  It started the year I was born, 1974.
[01:15:05.128 --> 01:15:08.331]  Guess what started in Europe the same year?
[01:15:08.331 --> 01:15:09.952]  There's a whole global system.
[01:15:09.952 --> 01:15:12.154]  And see, they've been lining this sucker up, man.
[01:15:12.154 --> 01:15:13.696]  They've been lining this sucker up.
[01:15:13.696 --> 01:15:17.079]  And they push the whole healthcare as if it's something that we all need.
[01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:19.901]  This is something that you have to get, and we're going to make it free to you.
[01:15:19.901 --> 01:15:25.146]  See, because people, when they think they're getting something free, they're subject to give up their freedoms for that freedom.
[01:15:25.566 --> 01:15:26.390]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:28.819]  It's such a brainwash that it's so manipulating.
[01:15:28.819 --> 01:15:29.161]  Exactly.
[01:15:29.161 --> 01:15:30.928]  That's why Trump's getting bucked on fighting this.
[01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:34.256]  It's the whole system.
[01:15:34.256 --> 01:15:35.737]  They built it to surveil.
[01:15:35.737 --> 01:15:37.099]  They built it to dehumanize.
[01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:40.682]  They built it to steal your DNA, steal your voice, steal you are.
[01:15:40.682 --> 01:15:44.985]  And if you don't submit, you're deleted off the entire global cloud like that.
[01:15:44.985 --> 01:15:47.488]  You don't exist and everyone will turn against you.
[01:15:47.488 --> 01:15:52.392]  That's why the left everywhere lets homeless be everywhere, because they're getting you ready to let everybody just starve to death.
[01:15:52.392 --> 01:15:53.693]  Mark of the beast.
[01:15:53.693 --> 01:15:56.836]  Mark my words, within five to ten years, there'll be millions everywhere starving to death.
[01:15:58.837 --> 01:16:00.258]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:16:00.258 --> 01:16:02.159]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:02.780]  It is.
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.643]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:16:07.643 --> 01:16:08.803]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:16:08.803 --> 01:16:10.745]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:16:10.745 --> 01:16:13.306]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:16:13.306 --> 01:16:14.927]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:16:14.927 --> 01:16:16.388]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:16:16.388 --> 01:16:17.769]  You've got the children's.
[01:16:17.769 --> 01:16:18.850]  You've got the adults.
[01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:19.870]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:22.312]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children
[01:16:22.352 --> 01:16:24.073]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:16:49.093 --> 01:16:55.127]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:16:55.127 --> 01:16:55.848]  I just can't do it!
[01:16:58.766 --> 01:17:06.107]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.

[01:20:01.249 --> 01:20:19.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.517 --> 01:20:25.500]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.521]  Now you're standing there turned on,
[01:20:39.166 --> 01:20:47.008]  Bill Johnson's riding a shotgun with us, Caitlin Bennett, amazing reporter, as well as another incredible reporter, only we were joining us here in just a moment.
[01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:59.190]  And again, this is about the demonization they're under, not because we're victims, but to show the deception, where they get thrown out of events, and then the media says you didn't get thrown out, when their videos get 20, 30, 40 million views, and everybody can see the video they're being thrown out.
[01:20:59.890 --> 01:21:02.273]  So she got thrown out of Rutgers for no reason.
[01:21:02.273 --> 01:21:03.134]  The people are on tape.
[01:21:03.134 --> 01:21:04.535]  The cops say people don't want you here.
[01:21:04.535 --> 01:21:05.937]  You're thrown off.
[01:21:05.937 --> 01:21:08.460]  And then now the Daily Mail and others are saying we made it up.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:11.543]  We're going to get to that in a moment with these great ladies.
[01:21:11.543 --> 01:21:13.465]  But I started getting into this and I want to air some of it now.
[01:21:13.465 --> 01:21:15.167]  The whole five minutes is incredible.
[01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:18.451]  To Jamie White's story up on Infowars.com.
[01:21:18.451 --> 01:21:20.033]  CNN's Stelter says furious.
[01:21:21.328 --> 01:21:23.590]  That Trump is now the Infowars President.
[01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:32.977]  And then he constantly works to get us off air, lies about us with Oliver Darcy, and then gets up there and says, Trump's trying to destroy the media and take us off air!
[01:21:32.977 --> 01:21:38.862]  Even though he's never really said or done any of that, we're the ones trying to shut everybody else down that competes with us!
[01:21:38.862 --> 01:21:41.224]  You know, Infowars has more viewers than us, we really do!
[01:21:42.014 --> 01:21:44.697]  So it's just insane, Will, that he does this.
[01:21:44.697 --> 01:21:52.785]  We're going to play a few minutes of this, get to more of it once we get to some other topics with these ladies, but they sit there and attack logic in front of us.
[01:21:52.785 --> 01:21:53.826]  It's crazy.
[01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:54.927]  It's because of reality.
[01:21:54.927 --> 01:21:56.188]  They don't like reality.
[01:21:56.188 --> 01:22:01.333]  They don't like the fact that 1 plus 1 still equals 2, and you don't believe it equals 5.
[01:22:01.954 --> 01:22:03.476]  Well, that's what he says, actually!
[01:22:03.476 --> 01:22:06.098]  He projects and inverses reality!
[01:22:06.098 --> 01:22:11.324]  He says that I'm creating an alternate reality!
[01:22:12.503 --> 01:22:15.084]  And that Trump is picking it up!
[01:22:15.084 --> 01:22:19.545]  Oh, is that why I had brain surgeons on 20 years ago and scientists?
[01:22:19.545 --> 01:22:24.887]  Saying diet aspartame causes cancer and increased stroke and makes you obese?
[01:22:24.887 --> 01:22:26.667]  Now new studies confirm it again.
[01:22:26.667 --> 01:22:29.048]  AARP!
[01:22:29.048 --> 01:22:29.788]  Look at this.
[01:22:29.788 --> 01:22:32.069]  Diet soda linked to strokes and heart attacks.
[01:22:32.069 --> 01:22:34.809]  Massive increases in women particularly.
[01:22:34.809 --> 01:22:37.990]  Obesity, strokes, brain tumors.
[01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:39.871]  It was in the studies of racist monkeys in the 70s.
[01:22:41.718 --> 01:22:44.239]  But you can pull it up, Glenn Beck making fun of me.
[01:22:44.239 --> 01:22:46.100]  I said, Glenn, you're going blind from aspartame.
[01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:48.661]  Stop chewing the gum, stop drinking the Diet Cokes.
[01:22:48.661 --> 01:22:50.702]  He's like, oh, shut up!
[01:22:50.702 --> 01:22:53.684]  Tomorrow's news today, folks, we're not lying to you.
[01:22:53.684 --> 01:22:55.925]  Let's go to Stelter, here's part of that.
[01:22:55.925 --> 01:23:00.287]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is
[01:23:01.423 --> 01:23:11.870]  I'm sorry to say that InfoWars' president, he's promoting the same alternative universe as InfoWars and sharing videos from repugnant characters.
[01:23:11.870 --> 01:23:16.093]  Now InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[01:23:16.093 --> 01:23:16.954]  And pause again.
[01:23:16.954 --> 01:23:19.095]  Oh, it's a web show on hundreds of radio stations.
[01:23:19.095 --> 01:23:19.816]  It doesn't matter.
[01:23:19.816 --> 01:23:27.481]  The little web show that kicks your ass, the little web show until you censors have like 80 something million views on YouTube a week.
[01:23:27.481 --> 01:23:28.722]  You're a damn joke, dude.
[01:23:28.722 --> 01:23:29.122]  You got 100,000 viewers.
[01:23:32.805 --> 01:23:33.806]  It'll take forever to get to this.
[01:23:33.806 --> 01:23:34.606]  We'll air it at the end.
[01:23:34.606 --> 01:23:36.027]  And I want to get Millie's take.
[01:23:36.027 --> 01:23:38.948]  I want to get your take on this.
[01:23:38.948 --> 01:23:39.849]  I want to get Caitlin's take.
[01:23:39.849 --> 01:23:42.270]  But just the arrogance of these people.
[01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:47.913]  You know, because they can't attack you or take you out by doing real journalism.
[01:23:47.913 --> 01:23:50.694]  They attack you by removing you from platforms.
[01:23:50.694 --> 01:23:51.255]  Think about that.
[01:23:51.815 --> 01:24:03.503]  They can't, they can't remove Alex Jones by the traditional press, you know, doing this being a press person or going out interviewing people, reporting the news.
[01:24:03.503 --> 01:24:05.265]  They can't beat you on those grounds.
[01:24:05.265 --> 01:24:06.045]  They can't beat you either.
[01:24:06.045 --> 01:24:09.548]  And so now they're telling Facebook users, you will not say his name.
[01:24:09.548 --> 01:24:11.069]  My God, are we in the cult?
[01:24:11.069 --> 01:24:13.330]  Let's play a little bit more and we'll go to Millie and Caitlin.
[01:24:13.330 --> 01:24:14.291]  Here it is.
[01:24:14.291 --> 01:24:19.315]  Full of fear, mongering and conspiracy theorizing, InfoWars tells viewers that the world... Pause again.
[01:24:20.154 --> 01:24:23.697]  Total fear-mongering and conspiracy theorizing.
[01:24:23.697 --> 01:24:28.701]  I just showed you mainstream news saying everything that was in the studies 30-something years ago.
[01:24:28.701 --> 01:24:36.647]  I've had top brain surgeons, top chemical experts, top toxicologists, Harvard experts, Yale experts, University of Texas experts.
[01:24:36.647 --> 01:24:37.948]  I've made films on it.
[01:24:37.948 --> 01:24:39.569]  It's in another big study.
[01:24:39.569 --> 01:24:40.790]  Okay, it makes you fat.
[01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:41.491]  It's addictive.
[01:24:41.491 --> 01:24:42.552]  It kills your ass.
[01:24:42.552 --> 01:24:43.372]  That's AARP.
[01:24:44.153 --> 01:24:45.434]  Big-ass report.
[01:24:45.434 --> 01:24:46.915]  But I'm fear-mongering!
[01:24:46.915 --> 01:24:47.896]  Well, yeah!
[01:24:47.896 --> 01:24:49.497]  So people don't do it!
[01:24:49.497 --> 01:24:53.140]  You can't find gum that doesn't have it in it!
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:58.184]  I'm willing to believe that your voice is actually on the Mark Dice videos and not Mark Dice.
[01:24:58.184 --> 01:24:59.005]  Mark does better than me.
[01:24:59.005 --> 01:25:01.287]  No, you actually do it really, really good!
[01:25:02.850 --> 01:25:11.837]  You know, but there again, why would he attack you for reporting on the news, reporting on information, because they are losing.
[01:25:11.837 --> 01:25:14.259]  They're losing this information battle.
[01:25:14.259 --> 01:25:14.939]  They're losing.
[01:25:14.939 --> 01:25:18.802]  I love the fact that he thinks that Trump is the Infowars president.
[01:25:18.802 --> 01:25:19.943]  That's beautiful.
[01:25:19.943 --> 01:25:20.683]  I love it.
[01:25:20.683 --> 01:25:22.705]  That sounds like a T-shirt to me.
[01:25:22.705 --> 01:25:24.446]  Trump is the Infowars president.
[01:25:24.446 --> 01:25:25.707]  Are you serious?
[01:25:25.707 --> 01:25:27.268]  I would wear that shirt everywhere.
[01:25:28.894 --> 01:25:33.437]  Well, maybe we'll take your bank account away if you're seen wearing it!
[01:25:33.437 --> 01:25:43.342]  You know, my partner, when you played earlier, he's coming on actually in a moment on the same show, he said take people's phones away!
[01:25:43.342 --> 01:25:45.784]  We need to take conservatives' telephones away!
[01:25:45.784 --> 01:25:47.485]  We're not fascist or dangerous!
[01:25:47.805 --> 01:25:48.746]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:48.746 --> 01:25:49.126]  You know what?
[01:25:49.126 --> 01:25:51.067]  They want us to believe that they're here for the people.
[01:25:51.067 --> 01:25:58.033]  They want us to believe that they're actually doing the right thing for the American people by reporting the actual news, when they do just the opposite.
[01:25:58.033 --> 01:26:02.116]  They come out with all the lies, they come out with all the attacks, and then you're supposed to believe them!
[01:26:02.116 --> 01:26:06.679]  Because if you don't believe them, then you're like not paying attention to what's actually happening here.
[01:26:06.679 --> 01:26:08.120]  Spoken like a true white supremacist!
[01:26:09.017 --> 01:26:12.658]  Let's bring him in here, and I really appreciate him joining us, Millie Weaver, Kaitlin Bennett.
[01:26:12.658 --> 01:26:17.100]  Follow on Twitter for now, both of them, and we'll put those up on screen.
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:18.340]  Ladies, this is the three minutes we have to break.
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:28.083]  We'll come back and get into all the stuff you've been through this week, but just, you're getting tweeted out, Millie, by the President, a bunch of great black folks, and that was all just in one group you talked to off a live video.
[01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:36.586]  Somebody found it, snipped it out, how much they love Trump, and then how hateful the left is, and then the left just freaks out and calls it a hateful disinformation video that you put out.
[01:26:36.826 --> 01:26:41.567]  The president put out fake news showing his black supporters, Millie.
[01:26:41.567 --> 01:26:43.727]  Oh, you know, they're terrified of the truth.
[01:26:43.727 --> 01:26:48.528]  They're terrified that the president has more support than the mainstream media likes to put on.
[01:26:48.528 --> 01:27:05.892]  I also find it distasteful that Brian Stelter essentially called me a reprehensible character on his little CNN news show which has failing ratings, all because he's probably mad and resentful that me and Caitlyn totally destroyed him in a debate at Kent State.
[01:27:06.292 --> 01:27:09.475]  We'll talk about that when we come back, but you're right, I forgot.
[01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:15.421]  What, you got about 3 million views on Twitter and about 600,000 on YouTube.
[01:27:15.421 --> 01:27:18.764]  So that's like 20 times the viewers his show has.
[01:27:18.764 --> 01:27:21.927]  You shouldn't be allowed to be on air, young lady!
[01:27:21.927 --> 01:27:22.708]  Okay?
[01:27:22.708 --> 01:27:24.629]  Women's places in the kitchen.
[01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:26.171]  So says Brian Stelter.
[01:27:26.171 --> 01:27:26.932]  What do you say to that?
[01:27:28.581 --> 01:27:31.966]  You know, they just want to ban us because they have no arguments.
[01:27:31.966 --> 01:27:33.028]  They have no facts.
[01:27:33.028 --> 01:27:35.271]  They can't hold a logical debate.
[01:27:35.271 --> 01:27:37.114]  And so ban them, I say.
[01:27:37.114 --> 01:27:38.516]  They're tyrannical tyrants.
[01:27:38.516 --> 01:27:40.459]  They're on power trips.
[01:27:40.459 --> 01:27:41.781]  They want to essentially
[01:27:42.574 --> 01:27:42.974]  We're good.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:27:59.980]  No.
[01:28:16.849 --> 01:28:19.211]  And then we're going to show them trying to set up Caitlyn Bennett.
[01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:23.736]  They're calling her this evil white supremacist and all this crazy crap and say she's making it up.
[01:28:23.736 --> 01:28:26.018]  Nobody throws her out of anywhere.
[01:28:26.018 --> 01:28:26.979]  But you're going to see the video.
[01:28:26.979 --> 01:28:31.123]  If you're a radio listener, it's on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:28:31.123 --> 01:28:33.225]  Will Johnson's here, UnitedAmericaFirst.com.
[01:28:33.225 --> 01:28:34.926]  And you know, Millie Weaver more and more and Caitlyn Bennett.
[01:28:34.926 --> 01:28:38.790]  I've told you guys, plug your websites instead of promoting Twitter and Facebook.
[01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:41.572]  I know you can, you know, for now you're still there, but when we come back,
[01:28:42.313 --> 01:28:45.157]  Everybody take note of your... Remember, we have web pages.
[01:28:45.157 --> 01:28:49.963]  We're not part of a big corporate cult like Facebook where they tell us we can't say the name Alex Jones.
[01:28:49.963 --> 01:28:54.349]  Sure, use their systems while we can, but go back to our own websites like Matt Drudge said.
[01:28:54.349 --> 01:28:56.251]  Get out of these internet ghettos now!
[01:28:58.109 --> 01:29:02.672]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[01:29:02.672 --> 01:29:04.694]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:29:04.694 --> 01:29:05.774]  Good to talk to you.
[01:29:05.774 --> 01:29:10.417]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:29:10.417 --> 01:29:12.359]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[01:29:12.359 --> 01:29:16.942]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[01:29:17.202 --> 01:29:23.189]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.929]  I appreciate that.
[01:29:23.929 --> 01:29:25.551]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:29:25.551 --> 01:29:26.112]  Tell us about it.
[01:29:26.112 --> 01:29:26.933]  Well, it's really great.
[01:29:26.933 --> 01:29:28.234]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:29:28.234 --> 01:29:28.754]  I take it.
[01:29:28.754 --> 01:29:29.495]  It tastes good.
[01:29:29.495 --> 01:29:31.337]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:29:31.337 --> 01:29:33.299]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:29:33.299 --> 01:29:36.743]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[01:29:36.783 --> 01:29:39.626]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:29:39.626 --> 01:29:41.388]  They're known to turbocharge women.

[01:33:00.718 --> 01:33:03.380]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.647 --> 01:33:20.212]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:20.212 --> 01:33:23.836]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.836 --> 01:33:31.606]  Okay, so your co-host for your great program, notamericanfirst.com, just called you, just sent you screenshots.
[01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:32.928]  He was freaking out.
[01:33:32.928 --> 01:33:34.911]  He's like, we tried on our Facebook.
[01:33:36.038 --> 01:33:42.866]  To just put a link that you're even on the show right now and Facebook said in live time instantly, no, it's AI doing it.
[01:33:42.866 --> 01:33:43.828]  Yeah.
[01:33:43.828 --> 01:33:45.149]  And so everybody's freaking out.
[01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:46.411]  They made the press releases.
[01:33:46.411 --> 01:33:51.557]  They announced this three days ago, four days ago, and said, you're only allowed to talk about him bad.
[01:33:52.438 --> 01:33:57.661]  And so again, just don't call it Alex Jones, just say the one, start calling me Voldemort, I guess.
[01:33:57.661 --> 01:33:59.822]  The one who must not be named is live right now.
[01:33:59.822 --> 01:34:08.888]  This is going to backfire, but when you've got $76 billion and you're 34 years old and you talk like a robot, you've gotten away with so many crimes, you think you can do this.
[01:34:08.888 --> 01:34:10.208]  Again, this isn't about Alex Jones.
[01:34:10.208 --> 01:34:13.910]  This is about them saying that you can't say somebody's name.
[01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:15.171]  But your buddy's blown away right now.
[01:34:15.171 --> 01:34:16.672]  We're going to see if he gets, try to get him on the hotline.
[01:34:16.792 --> 01:34:36.006]  Yeah, yeah, he just sent me a message saying that as soon as he posted anything, but he posted this live feed right now on Facebook and he said immediately, not even seconds, immediately it's blocking it, no likes, zero likes, no one's responding to it, no comments, nothing, like it never was even posted.
[01:34:36.006 --> 01:34:38.848]  And they gave a message saying Jones is an evil, far-right, dangerous person.
[01:34:38.848 --> 01:34:40.069]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:34:40.069 --> 01:34:41.190]  Then they defame me.
[01:34:41.190 --> 01:34:43.512]  They don't just say you can't have it, there's a little defamation on it.
[01:34:43.692 --> 01:34:44.232]  Yes, yeah.
[01:34:44.232 --> 01:34:47.595]  Here's one that was posted on Twitter by William J. Nolan.
[01:34:47.595 --> 01:34:48.716]  Let's get back to our guests.
[01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:54.760]  I want you ladies back on the show tomorrow, because you have the time to go through all this, and Will is, well, the weekday show, 11 a.m.
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.140]  Central.
[01:34:55.140 --> 01:34:57.122]  You guys should come on David Knight in the morning as well.
[01:34:57.122 --> 01:35:02.786]  I mean, this is really, because you guys are now being lied about in the media in real time, being called despicable.
[01:35:02.786 --> 01:35:09.251]  Trump tweeted a despicable video by a despicable, what was the exact term Stelter used, the news used about you.
[01:35:09.971 --> 01:35:14.695]  Horrible, you out there loving people coming together, white lady and black people.
[01:35:14.695 --> 01:35:22.801]  We're going to play this evil clip here, Millie, but before we play what the president tweeted, do you want to admit how horrible you are and agree that stulture controls reality?
[01:35:24.315 --> 01:35:34.118]  Oh yes, I'm so reprehensible because I like to tell the truth, and because for the past two years I've been saying that this Russia collusion story was a hoax.
[01:35:34.118 --> 01:35:38.780]  But no, he's not the reprehensible person, at least he won't admit to.
[01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:39.120]  Why?
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.880]  Because he's fake news.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.101]  Again, that's in the full clip.
[01:35:42.101 --> 01:35:44.201]  He did a whole show, I guess, yesterday on it.
[01:35:44.201 --> 01:35:44.961]  We're going to play it now.
[01:35:44.961 --> 01:35:49.203]  It's up on InfoWars.com, but here is the video that he says
[01:35:50.023 --> 01:35:58.527]  There was a reprehensible reporter at Infowars, all part of the evil right-wing white supremacy, regular stuff, and then this was the evil.
[01:35:58.527 --> 01:36:00.628]  Here's what the president tweeted.
[01:36:00.628 --> 01:36:04.230]  I stand for all his policies, both religiously and politically.
[01:36:04.230 --> 01:36:09.212]  He's already done so much for the country, and he's really doing a great job.
[01:36:09.212 --> 01:36:12.734]  As far as abortion goes, that was one of my big issues.
[01:36:12.734 --> 01:36:18.717]  I very heavily stand for the unborn, and so his policies, as far as that goes, has really, really affected me.
[01:36:22.208 --> 01:36:23.989]  He is a great man for our country.
[01:36:23.989 --> 01:36:25.029]  I do believe so.
[01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:26.310]  Yes, I do.
[01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.990]  I love Trump.
[01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:28.090]  Go Trump!
[01:36:28.090 --> 01:36:29.411]  The hate is clearly over there.
[01:36:29.411 --> 01:36:33.813]  You can feel the vibes of hate coming from over there.
[01:36:33.813 --> 01:36:37.494]  And you look over here, the people aren't screaming at them.
[01:36:38.275 --> 01:36:39.836]  Peaceful protesting.
[01:36:39.836 --> 01:36:42.679]  That's not what peaceful protesting is all about.
[01:36:42.679 --> 01:36:44.680]  This is what they think is acceptable.
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.362]  This is not what Trump stands for.
[01:36:46.362 --> 01:36:47.663]  But they don't understand that.
[01:36:47.663 --> 01:36:51.266]  Why are they mad for us believing what we believe when we're not mad at them for believing what they believe?
[01:36:51.266 --> 01:36:54.269]  Like, I mean, I think it's all out here to get each other out of our skin and I love it.
[01:36:54.269 --> 01:36:55.750]  It's out here for entertainment purposes for me.
[01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:58.032]  They say because I'm black I should be over there.
[01:36:58.032 --> 01:36:58.993]  And I'm not black.
[01:36:58.993 --> 01:36:59.694]  I don't go by black.
[01:36:59.694 --> 01:37:00.595]  I go by two or more races.
[01:37:01.826 --> 01:37:02.146]  I can't
[01:37:24.016 --> 01:37:27.759]  The president said, I love this, and retweeted it, it got millions of views, a little snippet.
[01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:29.060]  So Milley, do you want to apologize?
[01:37:29.060 --> 01:37:30.541]  Brian Stelter is God.
[01:37:30.541 --> 01:37:35.124]  He said that the president tweeted a reprehensible video report of InfoWars.
[01:37:35.124 --> 01:37:36.685]  Of course, he insulted his audience.
[01:37:36.685 --> 01:37:37.846]  He didn't show the clip.
[01:37:37.846 --> 01:37:40.368]  Why don't you apologize to America for what you just did?
[01:37:41.704 --> 01:37:53.810]  Yes, you know, I am so sorry, Brian Stelter, for showing a bunch of black Trump supporters and giving them a platform, a place where they can voice their opinions, essentially.
[01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:55.291]  Will, you want to decry her?
[01:37:55.291 --> 01:38:00.133]  Let's just say, in fact, the order as any informed person must be explicitly condemned.
[01:38:00.133 --> 01:38:01.234]  I condemn you, Millie.
[01:38:02.234 --> 01:38:04.375]  So let's bring in Caitlyn Bennett.
[01:38:04.375 --> 01:38:06.196]  Caitlyn, you're all over the Daily Mail, you name it.
[01:38:06.196 --> 01:38:08.958]  They claim you're making it up that you're thrown out of Bernie rallies.
[01:38:08.958 --> 01:38:10.859]  You're making it up you were thrown off Rogers.
[01:38:10.859 --> 01:38:15.261]  I watched all the unedited videos of you just sitting there peacefully being thrown off both places.
[01:38:15.261 --> 01:38:18.283]  They say you're a damn liar!
[01:38:18.283 --> 01:38:23.566]  Yeah, it's very ironic that the video that shows me actually getting
[01:38:24.224 --> 01:38:28.367]  The cops called on me for being in a black space on campus.
[01:38:28.367 --> 01:38:33.550]  You know, the cops admitted five times that students called 9-1-1 specifically.
[01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:38.574]  Not only did they didn't just call the police department, they dialed 9-1-1.
[01:38:38.574 --> 01:38:42.056]  So the cops would come and remove me from the space.
[01:38:42.056 --> 01:38:47.940]  And there's a, I think it's like 15 minute, 17 minute video of her admitting it five times.
[01:38:48.659 --> 01:38:52.160]  And they still go on and say that I claimed.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:55.141]  And then they take the word of students who were there in the crowd.
[01:38:55.141 --> 01:38:58.622]  Yeah, they're on video saying, we called the police on you, white supremacist.
[01:38:58.622 --> 01:39:00.743]  And so you can't be on camera because you're a white supremacist.
[01:39:00.743 --> 01:39:01.924]  They defame you.
[01:39:01.924 --> 01:39:04.084]  Then they all brag about it when you get thrown off.
[01:39:04.084 --> 01:39:05.805]  And then they lie and say you made it up.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:17.355]  I mean this is, that's what I mean, it's just like the left just lies and lies like Jussie Smollett or the people in the chicken place that attacked me and then said I attacked them and then the news went to the store and they said no!
[01:39:17.355 --> 01:39:20.279]  They came to his table three times and said we're gonna kill your ass!
[01:39:21.658 --> 01:39:22.178]  Wow.
[01:39:22.178 --> 01:39:23.119]  I had no idea.
[01:39:23.119 --> 01:39:23.939]  I'm sorry.
[01:39:23.939 --> 01:39:24.799]  I had no idea.
[01:39:24.799 --> 01:39:27.620]  I have not seen the video.
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:28.480]  I've been so busy.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:33.282]  I have no idea that they called the police and said that you were in a black only zone.
[01:39:33.282 --> 01:39:34.162]  It's crazy.
[01:39:34.162 --> 01:39:35.543]  Are you kidding me?
[01:39:35.543 --> 01:39:36.863]  It was like a KKK deal.
[01:39:36.863 --> 01:39:40.185]  These black folks surround her and start screaming at her saying, get out of here.
[01:39:40.185 --> 01:39:41.065]  This is insane!
[01:39:41.565 --> 01:39:42.506]  It's not even a black school.
[01:39:42.506 --> 01:39:45.588]  It's just black people just come over because they're told a white lady's here.
[01:39:45.588 --> 01:39:47.329]  They're probably told by a professor.
[01:39:47.329 --> 01:39:48.510]  And then they just call the police.
[01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:53.874]  I've been saying it for almost two years that there's an attack on white people in this country and people still don't see it.
[01:39:53.874 --> 01:39:54.875]  And here it is.
[01:39:54.875 --> 01:39:57.977]  They are literally attacking a female.
[01:39:57.977 --> 01:39:59.899]  On top of that, where's the hashtag MeToo?
[01:40:01.087 --> 01:40:02.448]  I mean, there's two women here.
[01:40:02.448 --> 01:40:03.608]  They're being aggressively attacked.
[01:40:03.608 --> 01:40:05.269]  Where's the hashtag MeToo?
[01:40:05.269 --> 01:40:07.131]  How come they're not coming to their aid?
[01:40:07.131 --> 01:40:12.394]  Brian Stelter's office right now should be bombarded with the hashtag MeToo right now.
[01:40:12.394 --> 01:40:12.734]  I agree.
[01:40:12.734 --> 01:40:14.015]  So let me ask this.
[01:40:14.015 --> 01:40:16.036]  These are reprehensible women here.
[01:40:16.036 --> 01:40:17.196]  Guys, I've watched most of the videos.
[01:40:17.196 --> 01:40:18.857]  They were on InfoWars two days ago.
[01:40:18.857 --> 01:40:21.939]  Tell us the names of the videos, or they're on both your own websites.
[01:40:21.939 --> 01:40:24.581]  So people need to bookmark these sites so they can see everything.
[01:40:24.581 --> 01:40:30.064]  And you're going to start uploading in your own format, on your own servers, just ahead of what we know is coming in this country.
[01:40:30.624 --> 01:40:33.906]  Because this censorship, clearly, they're planning something big to overthrow Trump.
[01:40:33.906 --> 01:40:35.066]  That's why Trump's got to move against this.
[01:40:35.066 --> 01:40:38.148]  They wouldn't do this level of stuff unless they were planning something big.
[01:40:38.148 --> 01:40:40.269]  How do people find the raw videos to see it for themselves?
[01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:48.095]  Well, you can go to my channel, Millennial Millie, on YouTube, but if you want to see the video we just played, you can go to Trump's Twitter.
[01:40:48.095 --> 01:40:50.156]  As he retweeted it, you will find it there.
[01:40:50.156 --> 01:40:53.999]  Now, I want to add one thing here, Alex.
[01:40:53.999 --> 01:41:01.845]  I will say that I believe one of the actions that we can take against what's happening right now is we could lobby to add
[01:41:03.246 --> 01:41:06.689]  Political affiliation to protected classes.
[01:41:06.689 --> 01:41:13.394]  Because what we're seeing is not just about censoring people off of social media and free speech violations.
[01:41:13.394 --> 01:41:21.240]  What we're seeing here is discrimination against conservatives and political dissidents across the entire spectrum.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:23.902]  Laura Loomer can't even order up Uber Eats.
[01:41:24.282 --> 01:41:25.003]  She can't even...
[01:41:41.783 --> 01:41:45.309]  We're going to take away a app that he could use to talk to his family.
[01:41:45.309 --> 01:41:47.252]  That is beyond Nazi!
[01:41:47.252 --> 01:41:48.374]  I mean, my God!
[01:41:48.374 --> 01:41:49.336]  Yeah, there's the video.
[01:41:49.336 --> 01:41:51.499]  So great to watch this.
[01:41:51.499 --> 01:41:53.122]  Where is the hate?
[01:41:53.122 --> 01:41:55.566]  Somebody retweeted a clip of her and the president retweeted it.
[01:41:56.604 --> 01:41:58.465]  And last time I checked, it's got like 3 million views.
[01:41:58.465 --> 01:42:00.586]  I mean, we need 10 hours here.
[01:42:00.586 --> 01:42:01.467]  We're almost out of time.
[01:42:01.467 --> 01:42:02.768]  I've got to get you all back on tomorrow.
[01:42:02.768 --> 01:42:06.010]  Another segment's coming up, but since we mentioned it, let's play it going out to break.
[01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:11.733]  Just a quick clip of her being thrown out by Bernie Sanders, and they tried to claim that was made up, too.
[01:42:11.733 --> 01:42:15.055]  So here's Caitlyn Bennett being thrown out of a Bernie Sanders event for no reason as we go to break.
[01:42:15.768 --> 01:42:16.548]  It's live.
[01:42:16.548 --> 01:42:18.109]  Why can't I watch it?
[01:42:18.109 --> 01:42:19.469]  It's in quite an event.
[01:42:19.469 --> 01:42:20.390]  No, it's public.
[01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:21.830]  On his website, it's in public.
[01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:22.771]  Okay, well, wait.
[01:42:22.771 --> 01:42:23.011]  No.
[01:42:23.011 --> 01:42:23.171]  Okay?
[01:42:23.171 --> 01:42:24.672]  I'm just not allowed.
[01:42:24.672 --> 01:42:25.392]  Is there a reason?
[01:42:25.392 --> 01:42:26.572]  I'm just not allowed to leave.
[01:42:26.572 --> 01:42:27.893]  I have to have a reason, please.
[01:42:27.893 --> 01:42:29.934]  Do you have a permit for this?
[01:42:29.934 --> 01:42:31.714]  Do you want to ask me one more time?
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.905]  So I'm being ejected from a public event?
[01:42:41.905 --> 01:42:45.129]  That's a public event, advertised at a school, that's enough.
[01:42:45.129 --> 01:42:49.393]  The 20 minute video, the cops admit she did nothing wrong, no permits are needed, all lies.
[01:42:49.393 --> 01:42:51.035]  But again, they claim she made that up.
[01:42:51.035 --> 01:42:54.298]  They claim, we're gonna show you where she got thrown off Rutgers.
[01:42:54.298 --> 01:42:56.321]  There's like 30 minutes of it, but we're gonna show you!
[01:42:57.751 --> 01:43:02.933]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:43:02.933 --> 01:43:11.517]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:43:11.517 --> 01:43:14.478]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:43:14.478 --> 01:43:16.239]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:43:16.239 --> 01:43:22.501]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:43:24.602 --> 01:43:29.924]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:43:29.924 --> 01:43:32.886]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:43:32.886 --> 01:43:36.467]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:43:36.467 --> 01:43:40.769]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:43:40.769 --> 01:43:42.610]  I've got two in my home.
[01:43:42.610 --> 01:43:48.712]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:43:48.712 --> 01:43:49.553]  Don't live
[01:43:50.373 --> 01:43:54.436]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[01:43:54.436 --> 01:43:58.038]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:58.038 --> 01:44:01.100]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:04.062]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:44:04.062 --> 01:44:06.984]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:44:06.984 --> 01:44:11.127]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of MyPatriotSupply.
[01:44:11.127 --> 01:44:11.568]  We're the top
[01:44:12.614 --> 01:44:21.758]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:44:21.758 --> 01:44:27.100]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[01:44:34.363 --> 01:44:38.365]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.

[01:44:42.126 --> 01:44:44.109]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:46.633]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[01:44:58.058 --> 01:45:01.661]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:45:01.661 --> 01:45:03.443]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:45:03.443 --> 01:45:15.494]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:45:15.494 --> 01:45:20.519]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:45:21.279 --> 01:45:30.624]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:45:30.624 --> 01:45:38.448]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:45:38.448 --> 01:45:44.871]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[01:45:45.111 --> 01:45:50.053]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:45:50.053 --> 01:45:52.694]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:45:52.694 --> 01:45:57.396]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:45:58.789 --> 01:46:03.093]  Getting your protein has never been easier with InfoWars Life Protein Bars.

[01:46:39.662 --> 01:46:43.645]  These protein bars can help you with the boost you need to reach your goals.

[01:47:01.694 --> 01:47:04.375]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.903 --> 01:47:23.985]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:47:23.985 --> 01:47:26.047]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:26.047 --> 01:47:34.291]  Okay, well I had like 20 other stories I didn't get to, and I'm talking real fast because I want to get to it all, but I got Bill Johnson here, I got Millie Weaver, I got Caitlin Bennett.
[01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:40.113]  You know, you've got the president tweeting out what Milley's doing, what Infowars is doing, what Paul Watson's doing.
[01:47:40.113 --> 01:47:42.334]  You've got the media freaking out over it.
[01:47:42.334 --> 01:47:44.155]  They're supposed to control reality, the narrative.
[01:47:44.155 --> 01:47:45.436]  They're discredited jokes.
[01:47:45.436 --> 01:47:47.257]  They lie about us all day.
[01:47:47.257 --> 01:47:51.619]  And then you've got your co-host, your wingman for your show, United America First.
[01:47:51.619 --> 01:47:53.801]  He's calling you going, look, it's true.
[01:47:53.801 --> 01:47:56.202]  Facebook and Livetime won't let me link to Alex Jones.
[01:47:56.202 --> 01:47:57.483]  Folks, we're not making that up.
[01:47:58.383 --> 01:48:00.864]  And again, that's trying to rob you from what you can do.
[01:48:00.864 --> 01:48:02.545]  That's mass censorship.
[01:48:02.545 --> 01:48:08.208]  Like China, when they say you can't send out a Taiwanese emoji, or you can't say the dictator looks like Winnie the Pooh.
[01:48:08.208 --> 01:48:09.508]  That's banned.
[01:48:09.508 --> 01:48:10.669]  And Apple helps them do that.
[01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:13.970]  So, I want to have you ladies, who I appreciate joining us.
[01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:15.531]  You're joining us again on our weekday show tomorrow.
[01:48:16.131 --> 01:48:22.093]  Get into other topics, you and Will here, just about what this is like, how surreal this is.
[01:48:22.093 --> 01:48:27.356]  Now Oliver Darcy says take conservatives' telephones away, take their groceries away, take their credit cards away.
[01:48:27.356 --> 01:48:30.437]  I mean, they're always calling us Nazis.
[01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:31.917]  This is what Nazis do.
[01:48:31.917 --> 01:48:33.258]  These are really dangerous people.
[01:48:34.813 --> 01:48:38.876]  They're walking us into the Chinese social credit score system.
[01:48:38.876 --> 01:48:40.137]  That's what they're doing.
[01:48:40.137 --> 01:48:58.012]  And that's why it is so important that we figure out a way to, like I said, add political affiliation to protected classes because how are they going to be able to discriminate and lock you out of the system for being a conservative or a Republican if they have that protected class?
[01:48:58.012 --> 01:49:00.294]  You know, Millie, that's what we're told by the media and I think that's fine.
[01:49:00.874 --> 01:49:02.675]  But it's actually party protected.
[01:49:02.675 --> 01:49:10.980]  It's racketeering between these companies, it's false advertising, and they are lying to Congress and saying they're not doing it, then they're publicly in the news doing it.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:16.343]  So we already have tons of ways to get them right now, just like universities saying, you don't have speech.
[01:49:16.343 --> 01:49:17.584]  Plus, there's the creepiness.
[01:49:17.584 --> 01:49:18.645]  They're a cult!
[01:49:18.645 --> 01:49:23.247]  Zuckerberg says you can't say my name or he'll ban you unless it's negative.
[01:49:23.247 --> 01:49:25.909]  He's telling you, say bad things about somebody.
[01:49:25.909 --> 01:49:27.150]  That's a damn cult leader!
[01:49:27.150 --> 01:49:27.710]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:49:28.683 --> 01:49:39.392]  He's acting, you're right Alex, he's acting as a publisher essentially by telling people they can only say bad things about Alex and allow bad things about you on his platform.
[01:49:39.392 --> 01:49:40.774]  Violating section 230.
[01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:41.294]  Exactly.
[01:49:41.294 --> 01:49:43.136]  Strip their damn immunity.
[01:49:43.136 --> 01:49:44.457]  Strip their immunity.
[01:49:44.457 --> 01:49:47.019]  And I know I'm ranting, you'll both be on tomorrow, this is a shorter show.
[01:49:47.019 --> 01:49:48.460]  Let me go back to Caitlin Bennett.
[01:49:49.441 --> 01:49:50.641]  The whole media is jealous of you.
[01:49:50.641 --> 01:49:53.603]  You get like 30, 40 million views a week, I mean a month out there.
[01:49:53.603 --> 01:49:54.743]  You're doing a great job.
[01:49:54.743 --> 01:49:55.363]  So is Millie.
[01:49:55.363 --> 01:49:55.903]  So is Will.
[01:49:55.903 --> 01:49:56.964]  So is everybody.
[01:49:56.964 --> 01:49:57.704]  That's why they're scared of us.
[01:49:57.704 --> 01:49:58.224]  We're just real.
[01:49:58.224 --> 01:50:02.245]  We're not teleprompter fake people putting out, you know, Russiagate garbage.
[01:50:02.245 --> 01:50:04.726]  Tell folks again, and we're going to play some of this.
[01:50:04.726 --> 01:50:08.388]  It's like 30 minutes of it, but you're at Rutgers last week.
[01:50:08.388 --> 01:50:10.448]  The people are on tape saying they complain.
[01:50:10.448 --> 01:50:11.789]  They want you thrown off.
[01:50:11.789 --> 01:50:13.509]  They say you hate black people.
[01:50:13.509 --> 01:50:15.010]  We know it's not true, but you got to go.
[01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:16.593]  This is just the new thing.
[01:50:16.593 --> 01:50:19.280]  If you're a reporter with InfoWars, the media just says this.
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:21.585]  This is the effect of Brian Stelter and the lies.
[01:50:21.585 --> 01:50:24.713]  I mean, what is it like to be dehumanized like this?
[01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:31.952]  What's frustrating is that Facebook comes out and says you can't post an InfoWars link.
[01:50:31.952 --> 01:50:36.413]  You can't post anything about InfoWars unless you're talking badly about them.
[01:50:36.413 --> 01:50:45.296]  And then these huge publications that have 5.5 million followers combined just on Twitter are putting out lies about me.
[01:50:45.296 --> 01:50:50.958]  So if I want to tell the truth and people want to spread the truth and combat this actual fake news,
[01:50:51.428 --> 01:50:53.789]  They can't even post the link to the truth!
[01:50:53.789 --> 01:51:01.453]  And that's what, that's their goal, is we tell the truth, they want to make sure that it can't get out there, because it destroys their narrative.
[01:51:01.453 --> 01:51:12.539]  So it's like we're a gladiator, you're a gladiator, and they put you in the ring, we all chained up and tied up, and then they come over and stab you, and they go, I'm the champion!
[01:51:12.539 --> 01:51:14.760]  Exactly.
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.921]  That's the only way Brian Stelter can win!
[01:51:19.077 --> 01:51:20.298]  He's got a cheat.
[01:51:20.298 --> 01:51:21.118]  They've got a cheat.
[01:51:21.118 --> 01:51:21.859]  They're so weak.
[01:51:21.859 --> 01:51:24.060]  They're a bunch of soy boy beta males.
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:25.521]  They cannot combat.
[01:51:25.521 --> 01:51:29.063]  They can't even go up against women like us, me and Caitlyn.
[01:51:29.063 --> 01:51:31.744]  That's why they're freaking out and they're wanting to censor us.
[01:51:31.744 --> 01:51:33.205]  It's sad, Alex.
[01:51:33.205 --> 01:51:38.888]  You know what's really sad is that you have people going on social media just blowing CNN out of the water.
[01:51:39.548 --> 01:51:41.210]  And that's the part that they can't understand.
[01:51:41.210 --> 01:51:42.411]  That's the part they don't like.
[01:51:42.411 --> 01:51:43.613]  How is this happening?
[01:51:43.613 --> 01:51:49.739]  Even Facebook worked with CNN to try to boost their ratings, and it fell flat on its face.
[01:51:49.739 --> 01:51:51.221]  You remember that?
[01:51:51.221 --> 01:51:51.762]  What's his name?
[01:51:53.513 --> 01:51:54.534]  Funny hairdo.
[01:51:54.534 --> 01:51:57.335]  CIA guy.
[01:51:57.335 --> 01:51:59.316]  The robber baron, Anderson Cooper.
[01:51:59.316 --> 01:52:04.578]  They paid him something like, Facebook paid CNN like they were this precious thing on his pedestal.
[01:52:04.578 --> 01:52:07.280]  70-something, was it 80-something million, I forget.
[01:52:07.280 --> 01:52:08.440]  Look it up, fact check that.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:16.084]  It's like 80-something million, and they would shoot it in the wrong aspect ratio, they would run fake car noise like he was outside at DC at night.
[01:52:16.084 --> 01:52:19.946]  And it would get like 5,000 viewers, even with them pushing it to all of Facebook.
[01:52:20.946 --> 01:52:24.788]  Two and a half billion people will not watch Anderson Cooper.
[01:52:24.788 --> 01:52:26.708]  You can't make people watch CNN.
[01:52:26.708 --> 01:52:38.113]  But it's the point that they're doing all that they can to get people to watch them, and you have people like these young ladies come on and just completely blow them out of the water because they're showing the truth.
[01:52:38.113 --> 01:52:40.114]  They're exposing what people are doing.
[01:52:40.114 --> 01:52:40.714]  And don't they get that?
[01:52:40.714 --> 01:52:41.594]  And they don't like it.
[01:52:41.594 --> 01:52:44.455]  Even if they ban them, other people step up.
[01:52:44.455 --> 01:52:45.736]  It's CNN everybody hates.
[01:52:45.916 --> 01:52:47.197]  It's MSNBC!
[01:52:47.197 --> 01:52:48.358]  No one wants you!
[01:52:48.358 --> 01:52:51.239]  The American spirit exists in these ladies.
[01:52:51.239 --> 01:52:58.283]  And they don't like it because they go out there and they report the truth and they can't have people like them doing what they're doing.
[01:52:58.283 --> 01:52:59.924]  And they're blowing CNN out the water.
[01:52:59.924 --> 01:53:01.245]  It's like, how do we stop this?
[01:53:01.245 --> 01:53:02.106]  How do we stop this?
[01:53:02.106 --> 01:53:03.166]  Censor them all.
[01:53:03.166 --> 01:53:03.587]  There it is.
[01:53:03.587 --> 01:53:06.989]  Facebook paying for news shows from ABC, CNN, Fox.
[01:53:06.989 --> 01:53:08.009]  And I remember the number.
[01:53:08.009 --> 01:53:09.470]  It was like $78 or $88 million.
[01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:10.851]  I always get my numbers twisted.
[01:53:10.851 --> 01:53:11.291]  Scroll down.
[01:53:13.232 --> 01:53:14.932]  Everything is 100% fake.
[01:53:14.932 --> 01:53:17.553]  And for Brian Stelter to attack these young ladies...
[01:53:36.002 --> 01:53:37.282]  It's ridiculous.
[01:53:37.282 --> 01:53:37.942]  No, I agree with him.
[01:53:37.942 --> 01:53:38.422]  You're reprehensible.
[01:53:38.422 --> 01:53:39.603]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:53:39.603 --> 01:53:42.163]  I mean, is he afraid of ladies now?
[01:53:42.163 --> 01:53:43.003]  Is that, I mean, seriously?
[01:53:43.003 --> 01:53:44.344]  I think he probably is.
[01:53:44.344 --> 01:53:45.784]  You know, you're both reprehensible.
[01:53:45.784 --> 01:53:46.724]  Here, let's play a short clip.
[01:53:46.724 --> 01:53:48.064]  There's like 30 minutes of it.
[01:53:48.064 --> 01:53:49.444]  Here you are at Rutgers.
[01:53:49.444 --> 01:53:53.885]  What day was this last week that you were there, Kaitlin Bennett, and you got thrown off?
[01:53:53.885 --> 01:53:56.706]  I believe it was Thursday.
[01:53:56.706 --> 01:53:57.966]  I believe it was Thursday.
[01:53:57.966 --> 01:54:03.447]  I did want to mention the place that we're at where that girl was just losing her mind and her program was off.
[01:54:03.925 --> 01:54:08.709]  It was actually a memorial for a communist that graduated from Rutgers.
[01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:10.611]  This is a pure Stalinist.
[01:54:10.611 --> 01:54:14.655]  Stalin killed 60 million people under his socialist regime.
[01:54:14.655 --> 01:54:16.296]  And they memorialized that.
[01:54:16.296 --> 01:54:20.180]  Oh, they say it all in the video, and you're just standing on the side of the sidewalk with some statue there.
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:23.323]  They're like, this is our god, our commie god.
[01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:24.304]  I watched the whole video.
[01:54:24.724 --> 01:54:28.308]  Well, like while I was exercising last week in the morning.
[01:54:28.308 --> 01:54:31.231]  And I think the cops like seven times say, yeah, they called.
[01:54:31.231 --> 01:54:32.272]  People go, yeah, I called.
[01:54:32.272 --> 01:54:33.593]  Get your ass out of here.
[01:54:33.593 --> 01:54:36.796]  Then they're interviewed saying you made all this up.
[01:54:36.796 --> 01:54:37.137]  Here it is.
[01:54:38.203 --> 01:54:41.306]  The most notable alumni of this university.
[01:54:41.306 --> 01:54:44.569]  He's a scholar, an athlete, a singer, and a global activist.
[01:54:44.569 --> 01:54:46.590]  And he was an amazing renaissance man.
[01:54:46.590 --> 01:54:53.036]  I'm just asking respectfully and peacefully, if we're going to have this kind of political dialogue, please have it off of this sacred space.
[01:54:59.642 --> 01:55:02.884]  No, I'm saying this kind of dialogue right now.
[01:55:02.884 --> 01:55:04.604]  What kind of dialogue would be allowed?
[01:55:04.604 --> 01:55:11.848]  I'm not the one to decide what's definable and what's definable as appropriate and inappropriate, but I'm saying this space was erected.
[01:55:11.848 --> 01:55:12.888]  Alright, let's stop there.
[01:55:12.888 --> 01:55:17.470]  The part I want is the cops saying, I saw it like six, seven times, they call the cops on you, they say get off.
[01:55:17.470 --> 01:55:18.150]  We don't have that?
[01:55:18.150 --> 01:55:21.052]  Okay, well let's just do it this way.
[01:55:21.052 --> 01:55:26.134]  Caitlin, tell people the name of the video on your website so people can go watch the raw, you know, whatever it is, 30 minutes or whatever.
[01:55:27.051 --> 01:55:28.412]  Yes, so it's Liberty Hangout.
[01:55:28.412 --> 01:55:29.613]  It's the YouTube channel.
[01:55:29.613 --> 01:55:31.774]  It's also on libertyhangout.org.
[01:55:31.774 --> 01:55:33.255]  It is my website.
[01:55:33.255 --> 01:55:35.397]  I run it with my fiancée, Justin.
[01:55:35.397 --> 01:55:45.783]  And then it's obviously on Infowars.com, but it's called Cops Call, or Liberals at Rutgers Call Cops on Conservative Women.
[01:55:45.783 --> 01:55:48.345]  It's something to that degree.
[01:55:48.345 --> 01:55:52.348]  And again, it's not even, the point is that now they're violating speech.
[01:55:52.348 --> 01:55:55.350]  I saw news on the Bernie thing too saying, oh, she wasn't thrown out.
[01:55:56.264 --> 01:55:57.947]  It's this thing where they do this.
[01:55:57.947 --> 01:56:02.955]  I saw Darcy and others on CNN saying, we don't censor.
[01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:04.457]  James Woods isn't banned.
[01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:07.502]  What Twitter does is it says if you don't delete these tweets, you're banned.
[01:56:07.502 --> 01:56:08.364]  Well, he's refusing to.
[01:56:09.116 --> 01:56:11.217]  But they make you do it like a re-education camp.
[01:56:11.217 --> 01:56:12.338]  Yeah.
[01:56:12.338 --> 01:56:13.538]  It's ridiculous.
[01:56:13.538 --> 01:56:16.400]  I mean, who gave him control over Twitter?
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:20.602]  Why do these people have control over the social media the way they do?
[01:56:20.602 --> 01:56:23.223]  It's because they're getting no orders from the Democrat Party.
[01:56:23.223 --> 01:56:28.165]  I still say that the Democrat Party in America is the domestic terrorist organized group.
[01:56:28.165 --> 01:56:29.686]  By the way, it's on the front of the video.
[01:56:30.046 --> 01:56:30.186]  That's
[01:56:52.156 --> 01:57:05.442]  Paul Joseph Watson is joining us with exclusive on him being banned and call all these names and he is planning to file suit in England over the defamation by Facebook and others and this isn't happy we're not litigious but man they're trying to get us killed and please don't forget.

[01:58:06.138 --> 01:58:16.219]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[01:58:35.105 --> 01:58:36.605]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:58:36.605 --> 01:58:38.086]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:58:38.086 --> 01:58:44.788]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:58:44.788 --> 01:58:46.269]  Turbo Force at M4sLife.com.
