[00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:09.548]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Monday, September 10, 2019.
[00:00:09.548 --> 00:00:15.112]  To say this is going to be one hell of a transmission is putting it lightly.
[00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:22.278]  We have breaking news coming up on the worsening situation with illegal alien invaders from the Congo.
[00:00:23.158 --> 00:00:30.128]  Infested nation with Ebola, pouring in not by the hundreds, but the thousands to Texas.
[00:00:30.128 --> 00:00:32.671]  Global exclusives coming up here today.
[00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:35.054]  First, here's John Bowne's report on the danger.
[00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:41.150]  The number of Ebola cases surpasses 2,000 in the Congo, where it originates from.
[00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.513]  Those fighting the horrific viral hemorrhagic fever are under attack, as Reuters reported.
[00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:58.359]  The deputy mayor of Benai, in the Eastern Democratic of Congo, said 13 civilians were killed in an attack by the Allied Democratic Forces, the ADF, a group thought to be linked to the Islamic State.
[00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:06.826]  Back in 2014, the Sierra Leone outbreak resulted in over 28,000 infections and roughly 11,000 dead.
[00:01:06.826 --> 00:01:11.269]  It's no wonder that we are seeing immigrants from the Congo crossing the U.S.'
[00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.770]  's southwestern border.
[00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.851]  Recently, U.S.
[00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:17.534]  Border Patrol reported they had apprehended 15 immigrants from Congo.
[00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:18.134]  I don't know.
[00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:49.177]  But even if Colfage's information is flawed, what's to stop Ebola from spreading amongst refugees south of the border?
[00:01:49.177 --> 00:01:49.917]  And then what?
[00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:59.021]  Over a million immigrants will cross the border in 2019 alone, and they are being flown and bussed all over the United States on the taxpayer's dime.
[00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:02.302]  Ebola can take up to 21 days to manifest.
[00:02:02.302 --> 00:02:08.825]  That gives an infected immigrant roughly three weeks to illegally enter the country and spread Ebola via body fluids.
[00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:16.848]  Unfortunately, hospital staff in the United States have been trained due to the international panic from the 2014 Sierra Leone outbreak.
[00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:22.650]  At present, the risk to our nation directly is extremely low just because of where this is.
[00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:34.514]  That may change if we get outbreaks into, if it spreads into Goma or into Kinshasa or into, you know, into Kampala or something like that as we get, if this sort of dwells on.
[00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:38.276]  But we do have a very effective screening program now that we've developed.
[00:02:39.076 --> 00:02:41.778]  But why would we disregard national security to a degree that puts us all at risk?
[00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:45.260]  Is it simply to satisfy the Democrats' fantasy that there is no crisis on the border?
[00:03:09.036 --> 00:03:15.319]  Last month alone, we saw 144,000 people come into our country illegally.
[00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.961]  It is overwhelming our system.
[00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:22.083]  President Trump made it clear that Mexico must do more.
[00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:31.128]  Yesterday, the President directed us, myself, the Secretary of State, and our team to meet with the Mexican delegation at their request and hear them out.
[00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.651]  Progress was made.
[00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:41.157]  The Mexican delegation brought forward proposals, but as the President said last night, it was not nearly enough.
[00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:46.301]  And we made it clear yesterday at the White House that Mexico must do significantly more.
[00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:48.783]  I think it's safe to say you've talked to all of our members.
[00:03:48.783 --> 00:03:50.564]  We're not fans of terrorists.
[00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:53.967]  We're still hoping that this can be avoided.
[00:03:53.967 --> 00:04:01.073]  At the same time, it's way past time the President's request for assistance
[00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:02.663]  We're good to go.
[00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:22.824]  By health and human services.
[00:04:22.824 --> 00:04:34.073]  We all believe that immigration is the constant reinvigoration of America, enriching America with immigrants, enriching America with their hopes, their dreams, their aspirations.
[00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:35.033]  And again,
[00:04:36.154 --> 00:04:41.017]  It's a happy, really a happy day because our Dreamers, they're the gold standard.
[00:04:41.017 --> 00:04:42.018]  They love America.
[00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:42.939]  They're patriotic.
[00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:50.724]  How can the government claim they have an interest in national security and continue a position of open borders where millions of U.S.
[00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:54.666]  citizens could die from diseases crossing that border?
[00:04:54.666 --> 00:04:55.787]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:00.347 --> 00:05:05.548]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:05:05.548 --> 00:05:14.130]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.111]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:18.831]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:25.113]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:32.536]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:35.498]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:05:35.498 --> 00:05:39.420]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.402]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:05:43.402 --> 00:05:45.223]  I've got two in my home.
[00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:51.326]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:05:51.326 --> 00:05:52.167]  Don't live
[00:05:52.987 --> 00:05:57.049]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[00:05:57.049 --> 00:06:05.013]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:06:05.013 --> 00:06:11.596]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:06:11.596 --> 00:06:15.498]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:31.618]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:35.855 --> 00:06:45.678]  As even mainstream media has admitted in hundreds of publications, we have a pretty close relationship with ICE, with Border Patrol, and with the Governor's Office.
[00:06:45.678 --> 00:06:48.119]  And InfoWars was the first to break.
[00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:56.281]  Seven years ago that Obama was shipping in men, women, and children and loading them on buses, they weren't being screened.
[00:06:56.281 --> 00:06:58.662]  They were being sent all over the United States.
[00:07:00.478 --> 00:07:18.406]  Well, Texas News, ABC, CBS, they've been reporting down in San Antonio, but it's been a national news blackout other than DrugsReport.com linking to it, and that is over 300 illegal aliens shipped in by smugglers.
[00:07:23.332 --> 00:07:33.521]  Well, we have sources, high level, many times they're on camera, this time they're not on camera, but they are probably going to be on Fox News the next few days.
[00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:39.246]  They're actually wondering why Fox News hasn't covered this when it broke last Friday.
[00:07:39.246 --> 00:07:45.092]  They've wondered why it's on drudge and it's not a national story that Ebola-infested
[00:07:46.854 --> 00:08:01.266]  Congo, that's had the second biggest outbreak in its history, some say the biggest, thousands dead, dead bodies all over the place, are fleeing and that these are middle class and wealthy Congonese that are actually coming in.
[00:08:01.266 --> 00:08:06.551]  That's why a lot of them are dressed very nice, they had money to get here.
[00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:10.234]  And they came into Guatemala, came up through Mexico and crossed the Rio Grande.
[00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:18.645]  And whereas you would think of them as poor in the United States, for people from the Congo, they actually had money to pay smugglers.
[00:08:18.645 --> 00:08:23.167]  They're here fleeing Ebola.
[00:08:23.167 --> 00:08:36.596]  And I'm not ready to report all this yet because we've got footage, we've got contacts, I've got to then run it past our contacts once we've got it together, the transcript, to make sure we don't reveal anything.
[00:08:36.596 --> 00:08:37.857]  But the Border Patrol
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.042]  Legitimately believes that Ebola will end up crossing into the U.S.
[00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:49.184]  And here's the even bigger news.
[00:08:49.184 --> 00:08:59.749]  Ebola has crossed before, remember, five years ago, and it got covered up, but was later admitted that Ebola was in Michigan, was in New York, was in Virginia, and was in Texas.
[00:08:59.749 --> 00:09:00.710]  That was all confirmed.
[00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:12.136]  And so, other than ZeroHedge.com or DrugsReport.com or LocalNewsInTexas or InfoWars.com, you're not getting this reportage.
[00:09:12.136 --> 00:09:19.381]  You go to DrugsReport.com, hundreds of illegals from Ebola-ridden Congo dumped in Texas, 350 more on the way.
[00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:27.166]  Well, I talked this morning to our ICE sources in Texas, and I talked to the governor's office.
[00:09:28.644 --> 00:09:34.447]  And off record, they confirmed, they said, yes, this is total crisis.
[00:09:34.447 --> 00:09:38.129]  We cannot believe that Mexico is even allowing this.
[00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:46.013]  And that the word is upwards of a thousand more have crossed in the last few days at different points.
[00:09:46.013 --> 00:09:49.755]  You say, well, why is the Border Patrol stopping them?
[00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:57.579]  That's like saying, you know, why can't you go out and grab every fire ant that's in your yard?
[00:09:59.224 --> 00:10:00.105]  We're overwhelmed.
[00:10:00.105 --> 00:10:01.265]  The border has collapsed.
[00:10:01.265 --> 00:10:02.566]  The judges are overwhelmed.
[00:10:02.566 --> 00:10:03.486]  The courts are overwhelmed.
[00:10:03.486 --> 00:10:10.250]  Nine out of ten never show up again to court.
[00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:16.454]  Imagine you're one Border Patrol agent and 300 people come walking past you and they say, we're here to turn ourselves in.
[00:10:16.454 --> 00:10:19.896]  Under law, when they make it past that one foot deep river.
[00:10:20.723 --> 00:10:21.984]  At the point they crossed.
[00:10:21.984 --> 00:10:24.084]  You can roll the video for TV viewers.
[00:10:24.084 --> 00:10:29.987]  Just one group of 300 and something coming across a week and a half ago, and they're in San Antonio right now!
[00:10:29.987 --> 00:10:33.768]  And more showed up last night!
[00:10:33.768 --> 00:10:37.389]  Now I'm gonna leave it at that, but we've got footage of all this.
[00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:39.510]  We've got new footage nobody else has gotten.
[00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:44.692]  Just like when we got footage of the big bags of cocaine being brought across that Trump played.
[00:10:44.692 --> 00:10:46.753]  We've got footage that powerful.
[00:10:48.885 --> 00:10:52.067]  But because we're banned from all the streaming services, you haven't seen it yet.
[00:10:52.067 --> 00:10:57.310]  And so it's got to be uploaded, it's got to be sent in from the crews in the field, and it's got to be aired here.
[00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.331]  That's the war we're in.
[00:10:59.331 --> 00:11:05.916]  That's why the globalists don't want us to have that big access to Facebook, or big access to YouTube, because they don't want you to see people saying,
[00:11:06.923 --> 00:11:08.844]  They can speak English, a few words.
[00:11:08.844 --> 00:11:12.966]  We're like, have you, because we have the French translation.
[00:11:12.966 --> 00:11:15.047]  Were you fleeing Ebola?
[00:11:15.047 --> 00:11:16.528]  Their secondary language is French.
[00:11:16.528 --> 00:11:18.428]  They say, yes, Ebola.
[00:11:18.428 --> 00:11:19.709]  We fleeing Ebola.
[00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:21.070]  Do you know people that Ebola?
[00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.390]  Yes.
[00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.432]  Yes, we flee Ebola.
[00:11:26.432 --> 00:11:29.594]  So we're going to have that for you.
[00:11:31.004 --> 00:11:32.405]  And that's why they don't want us on air.
[00:11:32.405 --> 00:11:33.145]  Well, guess what?
[00:11:33.145 --> 00:11:37.307]  We're on over 200 radio stations, over 100 cable and TV stations, a lot of mom and pops.
[00:11:37.307 --> 00:11:38.307]  They're all precious.
[00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:39.888]  They've got their own internet systems.
[00:11:39.888 --> 00:11:47.111]  And all the listeners should find out where we're on locally and promote their local stream, their local webpage, because they're not going to stop the signal.
[00:11:47.111 --> 00:11:49.972]  They're not going to stop us reporting on this.
[00:11:49.972 --> 00:11:53.693]  And you can always get the email as well, but not if it's Gmail or others.
[00:11:53.693 --> 00:11:54.814]  They will block our email now.
[00:11:56.032 --> 00:11:56.312]  That's right.
[00:11:56.312 --> 00:12:02.656]  They're so criminal, so evil, so controlling, they do that at the URL level stopping at Infowars.com article.
[00:12:02.656 --> 00:12:06.059]  But we can still send over News Wars and Prison Planet and Summit.News.
[00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:07.379]  That's Paul's site.
[00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:08.540]  So those are easier to send out.
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.362]  Summit.News, NewsWars.com.
[00:12:11.362 --> 00:12:17.186]  You need to send those out, folks, because it's the only way this gets out other than Drudge Report.
[00:12:17.186 --> 00:12:23.350]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, this is very, very important information.
[00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.791]  You're getting global
[00:12:25.868 --> 00:12:27.671]  Exclusive here.
[00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:35.104]  And I'm not ready to report all the details yet, but more have crossed, hailing from the Congo.
[00:12:35.104 --> 00:12:36.807]  The word is upwards of a thousand.
[00:12:38.643 --> 00:12:47.449]  There are others pouring in by the thousands from other African nations, including North African individuals admitting that they're with ISIS.
[00:12:47.449 --> 00:12:49.650]  That's already been in the news last week.
[00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:50.691]  This is insane.
[00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:51.992]  This is biblical.
[00:12:51.992 --> 00:12:58.336]  You thought the hordes flooding into Europe, those big giant streams you saw, we should probably roll that for TV viewers, you thought that was bad?
[00:12:58.336 --> 00:12:59.117]  This is just
[00:13:00.492 --> 00:13:07.135]  Distributed in smaller pockets, but 1,000 here, 300 here, 1,000 there, 5,000 here, 50 here.
[00:13:07.135 --> 00:13:24.743]  This is tens of thousands upon tens of thousands a week, absolutely pouring in, coming in in mass, and it's incredible moment for this country and for the world.
[00:13:25.968 --> 00:13:28.169]  And we have to get prepared.
[00:13:28.169 --> 00:13:30.610]  We have to understand how serious it is.
[00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:32.530]  We have to learn to deal with it.
[00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.391]  And we have to understand why it's happening.
[00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:36.972]  The globalists are collapsing our borders.
[00:13:36.972 --> 00:13:38.853]  They're collapsing Europe's borders.
[00:13:38.853 --> 00:13:49.177]  They are invading with the most poor, most diseased, most malnourished people on average, with criminal records, you name it, to absolutely collapse the system.
[00:13:49.177 --> 00:13:53.398]  Remember, the UN called for 600 million migrants to invade the US.
[00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:55.039]  Globalist plot to collapse.
[00:13:55.959 --> 00:13:58.981]  America explained.
[00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:01.642]  So, it's all coming up today.
[00:14:01.642 --> 00:14:09.125]  Then, cover of the New York Times yesterday calling for Paul Joseph Watson to be destroyed, taken off the internet everywhere.
[00:14:09.125 --> 00:14:11.827]  Total disinformation piece.
[00:14:11.827 --> 00:14:13.428]  I guess yours truly as well.
[00:14:13.428 --> 00:14:15.669]  Signaling the next phase of the purge.
[00:14:15.669 --> 00:14:17.189]  Trump must take action.
[00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.010]  He says he will.
[00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:20.571]  He's warned Twitter and others that he is going to take action.
[00:14:20.571 --> 00:14:23.412]  Well, he now said he will take action.
[00:14:23.412 --> 00:14:24.293]  So, I believe it now.
[00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:27.553]  He so far said, well, he's looking at it, he's studying it.
[00:14:27.553 --> 00:14:32.736]  But now there's a race to the finish lines with the censorship and all of it.
[00:14:32.736 --> 00:14:37.479]  We're also going to have two of my lawyers on with the Peppa the Frog case.
[00:14:37.479 --> 00:14:39.060]  I can give you the exclusive on that.
[00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.822]  That has settled as of right now, as of just minutes ago.
[00:14:42.822 --> 00:14:46.484]  InfoWars.com will have the global exclusive.
[00:14:46.484 --> 00:14:48.625]  The next 10 minutes, Paul Watson's writing an article about it.
[00:14:48.625 --> 00:14:54.029]  We'll have a statement by Robert Barnes, and he'll be popping in with Mark Rondazza as well at the bottom of the hour.
[00:14:55.765 --> 00:14:57.366]  Big victory on that front.
[00:14:57.366 --> 00:15:00.429]  Word is they spent $1,300,000 against us.
[00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:02.630]  We spent $100,000 fighting them.
[00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.731]  They came and deposed me.
[00:15:03.731 --> 00:15:05.953]  We deposed Fury, all of it.
[00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:07.895]  They were asking for $2.4 million.
[00:15:07.895 --> 00:15:13.079]  The judge ruled against them two weeks ago and said, you'll get $14,000 even if the jury says you win.
[00:15:13.079 --> 00:15:17.322]  Trial set for July 16th.
[00:15:17.322 --> 00:15:22.886]  They tried to settle for, I'm not going to say the number, it's so small, but I wouldn't be able to speak about it.
[00:15:22.886 --> 00:15:24.888]  But now they came back and said, no, we're going to go to the jury trial.
[00:15:26.403 --> 00:15:29.004]  And I said, Mr. Fury said everybody could use the frog.
[00:15:29.004 --> 00:15:29.705]  It was free to air.
[00:15:29.705 --> 00:15:31.286]  You're going to lose.
[00:15:31.286 --> 00:15:33.767]  They just came back with a $15,000 settlement.
[00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:37.249]  I can say whatever I want about what happened, and I'm going to.
[00:15:37.249 --> 00:15:42.952]  Hillary Clinton's law firm, the biggest law firm in the country, they won $2.4 million.
[00:15:42.952 --> 00:15:44.132]  You get $15,000.
[00:15:44.132 --> 00:15:47.174]  You spent $1,200,000 doing it.
[00:15:47.174 --> 00:15:48.074]  You lost.
[00:15:48.074 --> 00:15:48.775]  We win.
[00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:53.337]  We'll fight every damn one of your events, and America will defeat you!
[00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:55.238]  You will be defeated, globalists!
[00:15:59.378 --> 00:16:03.259]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[00:16:58.882 --> 00:17:05.226]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:05.226 --> 00:17:08.268]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.268 --> 00:17:14.192]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.192 --> 00:17:17.974]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:17.974 --> 00:17:18.915]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.235 --> 00:17:20.197]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:20.197 --> 00:17:26.793]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:26.793 --> 00:17:28.236]  Available at Amazon Books.

[00:19:19.336 --> 00:19:21.598]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[00:19:21.598 --> 00:19:22.519]  We have our own videos.

[00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:28.343]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[00:19:28.343 --> 00:19:30.605]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:19:30.605 --> 00:19:35.508]  InfoWars.com, man!
[00:19:35.508 --> 00:19:35.589]  Woo!
[00:19:36.963 --> 00:19:39.724]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:19:39.724 --> 00:19:41.545]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:19:41.545 --> 00:19:44.587]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:19:44.587 --> 00:19:46.488]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:19:46.488 --> 00:19:49.990]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.751]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:19:52.751 --> 00:19:55.012]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:19:55.012 --> 00:19:56.013]  That's where they find it.
[00:19:56.013 --> 00:19:57.994]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:19:57.994 --> 00:19:58.414]  Just go there.
[00:20:03.415 --> 00:20:06.005]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.064 --> 00:20:38.390]  Downtown San Antonio's bus station just got a little busier as hundreds of migrants from the Congo and Angola arrive in the Alamo City.
[00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.570]  We didn't get a heads up.
[00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:51.877]  Dr. Colleen Bridger, the Interim Assistant City Manager, says the Congolese migrants started coming in on Tuesday and said they traveled with a group of about 350 migrants through Ecuador to the southern border.
[00:20:51.977 --> 00:21:02.726]  When we called Border Patrol, they said, yeah, probably another two to three hundred from the Congo and from Angola will be coming to San Antonio.
[00:21:02.726 --> 00:21:12.575]  That includes Misenji, a Congolese migrant who didn't want his face on camera, but told me via Google Translate he came to America for security reasons and said, quote, my family is.
[00:21:46.212 --> 00:21:50.603]  We're gonna air that full report for ya, just in a few minutes.
[00:21:50.603 --> 00:21:52.829]  Here, wanted to give you a taste of it.
[00:21:52.829 --> 00:21:54.633]  Got a bunch of other reports we're gonna be getting too.
[00:21:56.046 --> 00:22:01.951]  MS-13 admits they're now using kidnapped children as human shields to get into the U.S.
[00:22:01.951 --> 00:22:06.374]  and they're loading up on from Nicaragua, El Salvador, and other countries.
[00:22:06.374 --> 00:22:15.801]  Once they get to Texas, mainly in California, they load up on government-funded buses and Democrat-controlled vehicles and they are shipped different parts of the country.
[00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:19.504]  In many cases, the children are thrown out on the street.
[00:22:19.504 --> 00:22:21.486]  In other cases, and I have these news reports right here,
[00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:28.952]  In other cases, they just simply sell them into sex slavery.
[00:22:28.952 --> 00:22:30.252]  And again, this is mainstream news.
[00:22:30.252 --> 00:22:31.213]  I have the articles right here.
[00:22:31.213 --> 00:22:32.813]  We covered it yesterday on the Sunday Show.
[00:22:32.813 --> 00:22:34.754]  It's just like liberal and loving.
[00:22:34.754 --> 00:22:37.955]  The left says this is a good thing.
[00:22:37.955 --> 00:22:44.577]  You remember back with the whole Ebola situation?
[00:22:44.577 --> 00:22:50.079]  Five years ago, it was breaking out in the Congo so bad.
[00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:50.859]  You remember all that?
[00:22:51.857 --> 00:23:01.285]  Why, if you just had doctors that had been around Ebola patients, they had to be on quarantine for a month at the CDC headquarters where they had whole wings set up.
[00:23:01.285 --> 00:23:04.007]  You can pull that up.
[00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:17.578]  But now we got people that say they're fleeing Ebola that had money to fly into Guatemala and then march up to the Texas border once they got dumped off by buses.
[00:23:19.676 --> 00:23:29.021]  And brought in to the good old United States of America.
[00:23:29.021 --> 00:23:31.582]  So just think about that.
[00:23:31.582 --> 00:23:37.645]  That's the point that we've gotten to as a culture and as a society.
[00:23:37.645 --> 00:23:40.387]  That's the point we've gotten to.
[00:23:40.387 --> 00:23:44.789]  That you've got all these infectious diseases pouring in.
[00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:45.309]  You've got MS-13
[00:23:49.406 --> 00:23:59.850]  That is using human shields of children, and using children that have diseases.
[00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.350]  So, let me look at my clip list here.
[00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.072]  Meeny, miny, moe, catch a tiger by its toe.
[00:24:06.072 --> 00:24:15.755]  Should I play that clip that we just played part of, where they've got the folks here from the Congo, and thousands more coming, and over a thousand have gotten in, according to Border Patrol?
[00:24:17.458 --> 00:24:23.341]  Or should we play even CNN calls out Bernie Sanders when he falsely calls border crisis fake?
[00:24:23.341 --> 00:24:26.863]  Yeah, that's a talking point from two months ago.
[00:24:26.863 --> 00:24:31.226]  That was used in 2018 and then for the first four or five months this year.
[00:24:31.226 --> 00:24:34.427]  Now that hoodwinking didn't work on the public.
[00:24:34.427 --> 00:24:37.289]  Saying there is no migrant caravans, there is no crisis.
[00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:42.892]  So now, Bernie though, looks pretty senile out on the campaign trail.
[00:24:42.892 --> 00:24:46.134]  Looks like he's got some old talking points there.
[00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.650]  How about we play this one, as I mentioned it.
[00:24:50.650 --> 00:25:07.976]  MS-13 gang members use child as a human shield with chicken pox to try to enter the United States, saying you've got to render aid, we've got sick children.
[00:25:07.976 --> 00:25:11.597]  And then when the Border Patrol gets completely overwhelmed by 150,000 people, I'm sorry, 156,000 people,
[00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:23.937]  That they're catching every month, and that's who they're catching.
[00:25:23.937 --> 00:25:25.939]  150 plus thousand people.
[00:25:25.939 --> 00:25:30.584]  They estimate there's twice as many that get in that don't get caught.
[00:25:30.584 --> 00:25:32.686]  And then people are like, well, Trump needs to hold them.
[00:25:32.686 --> 00:25:34.068]  Trump didn't get the money from Congress.
[00:25:35.418 --> 00:25:36.719]  Remember he wanted 12 billion?
[00:25:36.719 --> 00:25:37.360]  He got 1.3?
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.681]  Remember?
[00:25:38.681 --> 00:25:40.002]  Things cost money?
[00:25:40.002 --> 00:25:43.564]  Oh, and I saw the Mexican envoy on Fox this morning.
[00:25:43.564 --> 00:25:44.305]  We're trying to find it.
[00:25:44.305 --> 00:25:46.727]  It was about like 8.30 in the morning.
[00:25:46.727 --> 00:25:51.511]  And they were playing a clip of him in Spanish saying, We have told Trump we have too many!
[00:25:51.511 --> 00:25:52.371]  We can't take them!
[00:25:53.112 --> 00:25:54.213]  They can't stay here.
[00:25:54.213 --> 00:25:54.773]  Exactly!
[00:25:54.773 --> 00:25:59.895]  150 something thousand a month they're getting caught.
[00:25:59.895 --> 00:26:01.015]  You know it's way more than that.
[00:26:01.015 --> 00:26:02.296]  They're coming through your country.
[00:26:02.296 --> 00:26:03.857]  Most of them aren't even Mexicans.
[00:26:03.857 --> 00:26:04.897]  They're from all over the world.
[00:26:04.897 --> 00:26:06.598]  And then you're freaking out.
[00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:08.779]  And you just think magically we can handle it.
[00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:12.620]  You know, you drive through the United States.
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:18.343]  And other than some of the wealthier cities, the rural areas are poorer than they've ever been.
[00:26:19.326 --> 00:26:22.067]  You know, Americans are poorer than they've ever been.
[00:26:22.067 --> 00:26:23.487]  Trump's trying to turn that around.
[00:26:23.487 --> 00:26:24.687]  People don't have money.
[00:26:24.687 --> 00:26:27.848]  I mean, what does Mexico think?
[00:26:27.848 --> 00:26:30.269]  Mexico's on the high end of third world.
[00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:31.249]  The truth is the U.S.
[00:26:31.249 --> 00:26:33.910]  is becoming a third world country.
[00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:34.990]  And Trump's being demonized.
[00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.730]  Trump's being attacked.
[00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.250]  We're trying to stop it.
[00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:42.232]  But see, the globalists know once they've turned us into a third world country, we'll be dysfunctional forever.
[00:26:42.232 --> 00:26:43.812]  I went to a dental office yesterday.
[00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.944]  That's closed on Sundays, but that my dad owns a piece of.
[00:26:49.944 --> 00:26:54.828]  He's a dentist and he was going to fix a cracked tooth.
[00:26:54.828 --> 00:26:59.492]  And I get there.
[00:26:59.492 --> 00:27:03.935]  This is a place I've been going to for 10 years.
[00:27:03.935 --> 00:27:07.318]  In South Austin.
[00:27:07.318 --> 00:27:09.019]  And it looked like Guatemala.
[00:27:09.019 --> 00:27:10.120]  These were not Mexicans.
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.542]  These were people in traditional
[00:27:12.685 --> 00:27:17.793]  Indian, Guatemalan, and I saw Peruvians.
[00:27:17.793 --> 00:27:19.837]  And again, nothing against these poor people, but I mean...
[00:27:21.252 --> 00:27:23.393]  You know what a Guatemalan looks like.
[00:27:23.393 --> 00:27:25.374]  You know what a Peruvian looks like.
[00:27:25.374 --> 00:27:29.555]  And I was like, holy Toledo, because I've been in some of these countries.
[00:27:29.555 --> 00:27:30.936]  I mean, you know, I've watched PBS.
[00:27:30.936 --> 00:27:38.578]  I know there were women running around in Indian dresses all over the place and parties in the parking lot and just total insane asylum.
[00:27:38.578 --> 00:27:40.779]  I was looking at the license plates.
[00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:44.020]  These people didn't even have license plates, a bunch of them.
[00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.682]  They just do whatever the hell they want.
[00:27:47.682 --> 00:27:48.582]  And all I know is.
[00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.110]  I'm just supposed to not even care.
[00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.571]  I'm supposed to pay all the taxes and all the insurance and do everything I'm supposed to do.
[00:27:55.571 --> 00:27:58.292]  And boy, if I do something out of line, the cops come after me.
[00:27:58.292 --> 00:28:01.853]  But meanwhile, I go over to a place that was a nice area of South Austin.
[00:28:01.853 --> 00:28:06.374]  It wasn't a rich area, but it was a nice area.
[00:28:06.374 --> 00:28:09.895]  And everything over the last few years looks like hell.
[00:28:09.895 --> 00:28:12.776]  The sidewalks are all filthy and dirty.
[00:28:12.776 --> 00:28:20.198]  And there's a dirty diaper over here and trash cans overflowing and just the collapse of civilization.
[00:28:21.656 --> 00:28:24.119]  And we're not helping them from the third world.
[00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:26.422]  We're becoming the third world, folks.
[00:28:26.422 --> 00:28:28.964]  And let me tell you, Mexico's got problems.
[00:28:28.964 --> 00:28:35.552]  You go to Peru or you go to places like Guatemala, baby, you're thinking you're lucky stars.
[00:28:35.552 --> 00:28:36.293]  You're in Mexico.
[00:28:37.972 --> 00:28:40.655]  So, Mexico is collapsing.
[00:28:40.655 --> 00:28:41.476]  We're collapsing.
[00:28:41.476 --> 00:28:42.157]  I didn't get to the clips.
[00:28:42.157 --> 00:28:43.458]  They're all coming up.
[00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:47.924]  This is just so crazy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:47.924 --> 00:28:53.110]  It's completely and totally out of control and something's got to be done now.
[00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.893]  But the globalist on the left says, there is no problem.
[00:28:55.893 --> 00:28:56.614]  Go back to sleep.
[00:28:59.707 --> 00:29:01.669]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:06.974]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.974 --> 00:29:08.576]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.576 --> 00:29:16.924]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:23.290]  I don't know.

[00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:08.310]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.591]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order.
[00:32:12.591 --> 00:32:16.272]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:32:21.957 --> 00:32:23.678]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:32:23.678 --> 00:32:24.899]  This is racketeering.
[00:32:24.899 --> 00:32:26.020]  This is cartels.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.422]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:32:28.422 --> 00:32:30.304]  We need it now.
[00:32:30.304 --> 00:32:32.005]  You can take on Big Tech.
[00:32:32.005 --> 00:32:40.953]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:32:40.953 --> 00:32:49.000]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.841]  The way to fight back
[00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:55.303]  is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[00:32:55.303 --> 00:33:02.847]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:05.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.032 --> 00:33:23.153]  Big Brother.
[00:33:23.153 --> 00:33:24.955]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:24.955 --> 00:33:26.857]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:26.857 --> 00:33:28.538]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:28.538 --> 00:33:30.200]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:34.905]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.514 --> 00:33:48.061]  If you're a TV viewer, you see the incredible headline, DrugsReport.com, Ebola, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:48.061 --> 00:33:52.885]  Ebola, the second biggest outbreak in history taking place in the Congo.
[00:33:52.885 --> 00:33:57.669]  Border battle, hundreds from Ebola-ridden Congo dumped in Texas.
[00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:59.770]  The video.
[00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:05.112]  Kids with chicken pox being brought across by MS-13 saying it's human shields.
[00:34:05.112 --> 00:34:11.614]  The government admitting that up to 30% of the children aren't with their parents and have been kidnapped by known gang members.
[00:34:11.614 --> 00:34:15.375]  And the Democrats say, don't stop it, just let them in and let them disappear.
[00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:20.176]  The Senate report admits masses of them have been kidnapped.
[00:34:20.176 --> 00:34:23.137]  And watch that space at DrugsReport.com.
[00:34:23.137 --> 00:34:26.378]  Because we've got reporters at the border,
[00:34:27.578 --> 00:34:29.099]  And in San Antonio.
[00:34:29.099 --> 00:34:33.561]  I don't want to say it, because the NGOs will obviously call and warn the people.
[00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:34.421]  It doesn't matter.
[00:34:34.421 --> 00:34:37.882]  We already have been on the phone with Border Patrol this morning.
[00:34:37.882 --> 00:34:40.503]  I have already had our crew in the field.
[00:34:40.503 --> 00:34:47.126]  And I can tell you, the Border Patrol and the Governor's Office, the people we talked to, are like, yeah, we sent all this to Fox last week.
[00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:49.047]  It's not on there.
[00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:50.248]  And we saw it on Drudge.
[00:34:50.248 --> 00:34:53.249]  So when I was told seven years ago,
[00:34:54.861 --> 00:35:02.507]  And we met on camera with the head of the Border Patrol Union for that sector and we had the head of the Border Patrol for that area.
[00:35:02.507 --> 00:35:04.909]  They were risking their jobs against Obama.
[00:35:04.909 --> 00:35:10.052]  One of them actually did get removed later because they just cared about all the disease coming in and their duty.
[00:35:10.052 --> 00:35:11.794]  And they just said, listen, these aren't kids.
[00:35:11.794 --> 00:35:12.774]  These are human shields.
[00:35:12.774 --> 00:35:20.220]  We broke the first buses and how Obama was bringing in these whole groups, calling them families when they weren't.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:22.742]  But the Border Patrol didn't come to us first.
[00:35:22.742 --> 00:35:24.063]  They went to Fox News first.
[00:35:25.384 --> 00:35:27.765]  They went to ABC News.
[00:35:27.765 --> 00:35:31.908]  Well, they went to Fox News again last week.
[00:35:31.908 --> 00:35:34.009]  And Fox News is yet to cover it.
[00:35:34.009 --> 00:35:36.531]  They've covered the Africans coming in, but not the Ebola.
[00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:39.553]  Not that it's hundreds, but it's thousands.
[00:35:39.553 --> 00:35:47.237]  And that the Border Patrol believes that some of them may have Ebola, because they've known people that had Ebola, and they were fleeing Ebola-ridden areas.
[00:35:47.237 --> 00:35:51.660]  And that Ebola can chastate or incubate for up to a month.
[00:35:54.073 --> 00:35:56.634]  Number one, doctors used to come back from the Congo.
[00:35:56.634 --> 00:35:58.455]  The last time was a big outbreak five years ago.
[00:35:58.455 --> 00:36:02.096]  They had to be in quarantine for a month.
[00:36:02.096 --> 00:36:06.638]  So, you know, I'm just glad we're here because, see, Fox News won't run a lot of this.
[00:36:06.638 --> 00:36:07.238]  We're here.
[00:36:07.238 --> 00:36:08.498]  We break it.
[00:36:08.498 --> 00:36:09.599]  We cover local news.
[00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:10.519]  Drudge links to it.
[00:36:10.519 --> 00:36:12.160]  He forces it out.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:17.782]  And the reason I got the call from the Border Patrol sources was, hey, Alex, we appreciate you.
[00:36:17.782 --> 00:36:20.063]  You know, obviously, we try to give it to Fox first.
[00:36:22.571 --> 00:36:26.553]  The words were, they must be sitting on Hannity and Carlson.
[00:36:26.553 --> 00:36:30.935]  And I haven't called Tucker Carlson yet to see if they're making him sit on this.
[00:36:30.935 --> 00:36:36.537]  And I don't want to go into our back channel talks, but I'm a little busy, so I haven't had time to check into this yet.
[00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:44.146]  But imagine in America, you've got not hundreds, but thousands from the Congo fleeing.
[00:36:44.146 --> 00:36:52.490]  And these are more middle class and wealthy Conganese that are able to get to the United States via Guatemala, up through Mexico, with their kids.
[00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:54.031]  They're scared!
[00:36:54.031 --> 00:36:59.033]  And they've talked to ICE, who has ordered to release them because they don't have any beds for them.
[00:36:59.033 --> 00:37:01.114]  And they told them, no, we're fleeing Ebola.
[00:37:02.389 --> 00:37:06.372]  And so you're going to see video of all of this today and tomorrow.
[00:37:06.372 --> 00:37:14.119]  We've got our, every crew member we've got that can go is in the field at the border and in South Texas and in San Antonio right now.
[00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:14.820]  Everybody we've got.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.761]  We've got six people.
[00:37:16.761 --> 00:37:22.907]  I wish I had a hundred folks, but that's why InfoWars is so important because we'll hit the barbed wire.
[00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:25.269]  We'll cover the story the system doesn't want you to know about.
[00:37:26.414 --> 00:37:37.900]  Now, speaking of that, joining us is Mark Randazza, constitutional lawyer, one of the preeminent First Amendment lawyers out there, along with Robert Barnes, who's also a preeminent civil rights lawyer and First Amendment lawyer as well.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.060]  You see him all over the news.
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.621]  Constable, we'll go to Barnes first here.
[00:37:41.949 --> 00:37:44.151]  It just went live on Infowars.com.
[00:37:44.151 --> 00:37:45.732]  Paul Joseph Watson put the blurb out.
[00:37:45.732 --> 00:37:51.796]  Infowars settles Pepe the Frog lawsuit, pays tiny settlement to creator Matt Fury.
[00:37:51.796 --> 00:37:57.379]  You know, I told Paul the headline was, in major strategic victory, was the sub-headline, but Paul does what he wants.
[00:37:57.379 --> 00:37:58.700]  We'll probably change the headline.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:02.263]  But it's got Bob Barnes' statement in there, and it goes over this.
[00:38:02.263 --> 00:38:04.144]  So, Bob, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:38:04.144 --> 00:38:11.169]  We'll talk to Rondaza here in a moment as well, who's been doing a great job piloting this up to this point with you that came on recently.
[00:38:12.189 --> 00:38:16.650]  Get into why we did this and how big a deal this is.
[00:38:16.650 --> 00:38:20.111]  Well, it's really, it's an extraordinary outcome and an extraordinary victory.
[00:38:20.111 --> 00:38:27.832]  Because to set this up, you had one of, this was the first major case involving info wars in federal district court.
[00:38:27.832 --> 00:38:33.453]  You had one of the biggest corporate law firms in the country in Winston and Strawn.
[00:38:33.453 --> 00:38:37.574]  They employed as many as five different lawyers on this case.
[00:38:37.574 --> 00:38:40.955]  Mike, it would not surprise me at all if they spent over a million dollars
[00:38:41.411 --> 00:38:43.792]  And legal fees prosecuting this case.
[00:38:43.792 --> 00:38:50.335]  They were seeking a million dollars, seven figure plus damages, potentially in the millions of dollars.
[00:38:50.335 --> 00:38:54.756]  It was intended to be the beginning of a death blow in four wars.
[00:38:54.756 --> 00:39:04.180]  And instead, and you had Mark Randazzo's firm, which did fantastic work on the case across the board, established a unique precedent in the copyright context.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.961]  And what we always said from the very beginning,
[00:39:06.718 --> 00:39:09.660]  Is that they're happy to pay a licensing fee to anybody.
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.943]  They pay licensing fees to people all the time who establish that they in fact have a copyright.
[00:39:13.943 --> 00:39:18.087]  But what we're not willing to do is to roll over and play dead.
[00:39:18.087 --> 00:39:21.109]  We're not willing to let bullies bully.
[00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:29.095]  We're not willing to let Democratic Party advocates use lawfare to try to bankrupt their politically disfavored defendants.
[00:39:29.095 --> 00:39:30.856]  That's what we have made clear from the inception.
[00:39:31.345 --> 00:39:36.546]  So this is an extraordinary outcome across the board, an extraordinary victory across the board.
[00:39:36.546 --> 00:39:54.831]  In particular, in that context, for all the people out there that face something in life, whether it's in law or outside of the law, where they're the underdog, where they're the little guy, where they're the David against the life, where they're the person getting bullied, and they think they have no chance to resist, no chance to succeed, no chance to prevail.
[00:39:54.831 --> 00:40:01.012]  Just look at this case where InfoWars took on one of the biggest, most powerful corporate law firms in the world.
[00:40:01.542 --> 00:40:05.804]  Against lawyers that get paid thousands of dollars an hour for their work.
[00:40:05.804 --> 00:40:09.426]  That was willing to spend millions to try to come at Infowars.
[00:40:09.426 --> 00:40:18.370]  And at the very end of the case, they acknowledged, they conceded, they folded, they admitted that in fact this was not a million dollar case.
[00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:19.651]  This was not some big case.
[00:40:19.651 --> 00:40:22.833]  They were not going to have any success in court against Infowars.
[00:40:22.833 --> 00:40:27.815]  They were going, that you fought back so effectively, so persuasively, that the net effect
[00:40:28.263 --> 00:40:38.550]  Is that InfoWars today basically wrote a very small $15,000 check to reflect an honest licensing fee, which we're always happy to pay anybody who honestly owns a copyright.
[00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:46.234]  What we're not willing to do is to ever fold or capitulate to people trying to wage politicized warfare and seek million-dollar damage.
[00:40:46.234 --> 00:40:46.855]  I agree.
[00:40:46.855 --> 00:40:51.618]  Let's bring Mark Rondaz in and both of you can go back and forth on this, but this was a big First Amendment case.
[00:40:51.618 --> 00:40:56.201]  This WilmerHale, the biggest firm in the country, Democrat firm, has gone after hundreds of people.
[00:40:56.741 --> 00:40:58.722]  And they've just been capitulating, rolling over.
[00:40:58.722 --> 00:41:04.784]  I still say it's free speech, fair use, little bitty frog up in the corner, just something a listener put together.
[00:41:04.784 --> 00:41:15.329]  We sold it, barely sold, but I fought it and spent over $100,000 against their millions because I wasn't going to bend over to the next person, the next person, the next person to the gang rape.
[00:41:15.329 --> 00:41:22.632]  And when the judge, as I read the transcripts when you guys were in court a few weeks ago, doing a great job, said, hey, your maximum damage is $14,000, but I still want you guys to settle this.
[00:41:22.632 --> 00:41:23.672]  You don't clog the courts up.
[00:41:23.672 --> 00:41:24.973]  I respect the judge.
[00:41:25.313 --> 00:41:27.194]  Mark, overall, what do you think of this decision?
[00:41:27.194 --> 00:41:28.514]  Mark Randazzo.
[00:41:28.514 --> 00:41:40.019]  I mean, look, when they come at us first saying they want $1.2 million in attorney's fees, and then they wind up begging us for a pittance of a settlement,
[00:41:40.989 --> 00:41:43.331]  I think that's grounds for a victory lap.
[00:41:43.331 --> 00:41:59.545]  I mean, the amount that you wound up paying them for a licensing fee, I mean, when we were calculating what it would have cost for, you know, your first class flight to L.A., the kind of hotels that we like to stay in and the kind of meals we like to eat, I think our bar tab would have been more than that in L.A.
[00:41:59.545 --> 00:42:00.106]  just for the week.
[00:42:00.826 --> 00:42:03.789]  Well, I stay at Holiday Inn Express.
[00:42:03.789 --> 00:42:06.712]  I'm more like, I'm not rich like Warren Buffett, but I'm kind of a Warren Buffett guy.
[00:42:06.712 --> 00:42:09.795]  But no, I mean, just the money it would cost to do it and fight it.
[00:42:09.795 --> 00:42:12.738]  I kind of agree with what you said, like, well, when we come back, you're going to be able to get into this, Mark.
[00:42:12.738 --> 00:42:16.982]  But what the judge said, like, look, he told them, what, two weeks ago, you're not getting any money.
[00:42:16.982 --> 00:42:19.625]  And he told us, hey, you're not going to get their copyright.
[00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:21.487]  So basically the judge kind of already ruled, didn't he?
[00:42:22.352 --> 00:42:24.974]  Well, I don't know that he said we weren't going to get the copyright.
[00:42:24.974 --> 00:42:32.658]  The judge said that it was a, as a matter of law, it wasn't a rip-off of the Pepe the Toad.
[00:42:33.931 --> 00:42:37.073]  I honestly think that if that had gone up on appeal, that would have been reversed.
[00:42:59.938 --> 00:43:04.102]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:43:04.102 --> 00:43:14.490]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:17.633]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale
[00:43:17.793 --> 00:43:18.093]  I'm good.
[00:43:33.931 --> 00:43:43.115]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[00:43:43.115 --> 00:43:51.680]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.021]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[00:43:55.021 --> 00:43:58.403]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[00:44:01.418 --> 00:44:05.038]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:44:06.047 --> 00:44:07.808]  We have a new super special.
[00:44:07.808 --> 00:44:10.388]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[00:44:10.388 --> 00:44:15.830]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:16.851]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[00:44:16.851 --> 00:44:17.451]  Hope you get it.
[00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:18.231]  Sports broadcast.
[00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:18.691]  Spreads the word.
[00:44:18.691 --> 00:44:19.992]  It's a great conversation piece.
[00:44:19.992 --> 00:44:21.092]  It's 33% off.
[00:44:21.092 --> 00:44:23.293]  If we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[00:44:23.293 --> 00:44:26.094]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[00:44:26.094 --> 00:44:28.674]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[00:44:28.674 --> 00:44:31.295]  That is the best GoQ10, PQQ system.
[00:44:31.295 --> 00:44:32.636]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:32.916]  50% off.
[00:44:33.976 --> 00:44:35.357]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[00:44:35.357 --> 00:44:36.757]  RainForce Plus, amazing.
[00:44:36.757 --> 00:44:41.098]  TurboForce, which is just tearing our energy clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[00:44:41.098 --> 00:44:43.079]  Ultimate FemaleForce is incredible as well.
[00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:45.060]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.841]  All of the Force products, it's got Force in the name.
[00:44:47.841 --> 00:44:51.502]  It's 50 to 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:51.502 --> 00:44:54.403]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:54.403 --> 00:44:58.064]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:45:01.673 --> 00:45:08.437]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.

[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.421]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:45:16.421 --> 00:45:17.902]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:45:17.902 --> 00:45:24.386]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:45:24.386 --> 00:45:26.887]  So remember, you are the InfoWar.
[00:45:26.887 --> 00:45:28.688]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[00:45:28.688 --> 00:45:30.269]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:45:30.649 --> 00:45:36.051]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:45:36.051 --> 00:45:43.794]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:45:43.794 --> 00:45:46.635]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[00:45:46.635 --> 00:45:51.537]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[00:45:51.537 --> 00:45:54.698]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[00:45:54.698 --> 00:45:56.819]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:45:56.819 --> 00:45:57.259]  God bless you.
[00:46:10.171 --> 00:46:19.194]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:46:19.194 --> 00:46:29.256]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:46:29.256 --> 00:46:37.799]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:39.980]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.140]  You must experience it.
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.081]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:46:43.081 --> 00:46:48.143]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:46:48.143 --> 00:46:49.644]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:46:49.644 --> 00:46:51.124]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:46:51.124 --> 00:46:57.827]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:46:57.827 --> 00:47:03.930]  Turbo Force at m4slife.com.
[00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.631]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:15.973 --> 00:47:20.545]  Welcome back, Alex Jones, here live with two of the top First Amendment lawyers in the country.
[00:47:20.545 --> 00:47:21.768]  No brag, just fact.
[00:47:21.768 --> 00:47:23.814]  Mark Randazza and Bob Barnes.
[00:47:25.282 --> 00:47:29.564]  And we'll do it five minutes to the next hour on the big free speech battles that are happening too.
[00:47:29.564 --> 00:47:40.809]  Front page, cover of the New York Times declaring war on mainline kind of progressives that are pro-free speech like Rubin and people.
[00:47:40.809 --> 00:47:43.150]  And then, you know, calling everybody extremists and brainwashers.
[00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:44.531]  I mean, they are scared.
[00:47:44.531 --> 00:47:46.892]  They admit because we are popular.
[00:47:47.512 --> 00:47:48.954]  And they want us off air.
[00:47:48.954 --> 00:47:52.638]  And Trump is now not just signaling, he's saying he is going to take action.
[00:47:52.638 --> 00:47:54.860]  We'll talk about it with Paul Watson next hour.
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.022]  But going back to Mark Randazzo.
[00:47:57.025 --> 00:48:02.608]  We literally just, at like 11.20, so 20-something minutes ago, settled this case.
[00:48:02.608 --> 00:48:03.769]  We could have kept hammering him.
[00:48:03.769 --> 00:48:04.769]  We could have taken him to court.
[00:48:04.769 --> 00:48:08.151]  We could have embarrassed him with fury, saying, I don't own this.
[00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:10.572]  Everybody can use this frog.
[00:48:10.572 --> 00:48:13.534]  In 2015, he admitted in deposition he really said that.
[00:48:13.534 --> 00:48:14.414]  My God, use it.
[00:48:14.414 --> 00:48:15.515]  Anybody can use it.
[00:48:15.515 --> 00:48:18.516]  We have some composite with a little frog up in the corner.
[00:48:18.516 --> 00:48:22.118]  And then they say we've stolen his frog and done all this.
[00:48:22.118 --> 00:48:24.760]  So it is a big deal when they wanted millions of dollars.
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:34.303]  And when they spent over a million dollars, hell, they sent four lawyers here, all the depositions, all the time we deposed them, all their briefs, all their propaganda.
[00:48:34.303 --> 00:48:40.085]  But my biggest thing, Mark Randazzo, was Hillary in her alt-right speech two months before the election 2016 said,
[00:48:42.398 --> 00:48:44.420]  And this frog, it's white supremacist.
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.181]  Well, no one was even saying that then.
[00:48:46.181 --> 00:48:47.242]  It was a joke.
[00:48:47.242 --> 00:48:49.004]  When she said that, it got even bigger.
[00:48:49.004 --> 00:48:53.687]  And so they say Jones sued for using the white supremacist frog.
[00:48:53.687 --> 00:48:56.069]  Well, they're the ones that made it white supremacist.
[00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:57.791]  I have nothing to do with that.
[00:48:57.791 --> 00:49:02.194]  So it's just, it's so many levels, this weird psyop of this frog.
[00:49:02.194 --> 00:49:03.856]  And I get sued over it.
[00:49:03.856 --> 00:49:05.957]  And they spend over a million dollars reportedly.
[00:49:06.738 --> 00:49:13.948]  They're going to destroy me, and they're going to get $2.4 million, and then now it's $15,000 because we didn't blink going into trial.
[00:49:13.948 --> 00:49:16.592]  I mean, we'd be stupid, I guess, to go into the trial.
[00:49:16.592 --> 00:49:18.234]  Even though we'd win, what would we get?
[00:49:18.234 --> 00:49:20.057]  We don't want the stupid frog.
[00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:20.698]  Mark Randazzo.
[00:49:21.718 --> 00:49:37.243]  Yeah, I mean, look, it would have been, I think if we'd gone to trial, I can't imagine a jury looking at his statements where he released this thing to the public and saying that they believed him, that that's not really what he meant.
[00:49:37.243 --> 00:49:41.824]  You know, he regretted it afterwards is what I think they would have thought.
[00:49:41.824 --> 00:49:46.165]  But, you know, at the end of the day, you got to make smart decisions and fight another day.
[00:49:46.165 --> 00:49:51.287]  And again, like I was saying before, I mean, this is this this amount that you settled this for, I mean, that's a
[00:49:52.085 --> 00:49:55.309]  That's a bar tab at a topless club, you know, for one good night.
[00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:56.410]  So what the heck?
[00:49:57.557 --> 00:49:58.698]  So let me ask you this then.
[00:49:58.698 --> 00:50:01.980]  These are great headlines you're putting out, Mark, but they're going to declare victory.
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.801]  So let me ask you this and then let me ask Bob this.
[00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:07.943]  They're going to say Jones settles and says he won't be a white supremacist anymore.
[00:50:07.943 --> 00:50:11.285]  It's Hillary that defamed the damn frog, not me.
[00:50:11.285 --> 00:50:12.426]  We're not white supremacists.
[00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:14.067]  We never said it was white supremacists.
[00:50:14.067 --> 00:50:15.347]  I'm sick of them.
[00:50:15.347 --> 00:50:18.369]  They bring up Sandy Hook in my name constantly and say I'm doing it.
[00:50:18.369 --> 00:50:20.811]  They're the lawyers that live off the dead kids, not me.
[00:50:20.811 --> 00:50:22.031]  It's the same thing with the frog.
[00:50:22.031 --> 00:50:23.492]  They ruined the frog.
[00:50:23.492 --> 00:50:26.494]  I don't want the frog because Hillary turned it into a Nazi.
[00:50:29.383 --> 00:50:35.049]  Yeah, I mean look, this was never about the frog.
[00:50:35.049 --> 00:50:42.197]  You know, there's a reason that they went after only people with a certain political persuasion who used it.
[00:50:42.197 --> 00:50:49.325]  And they went after a lot of small fish who capitulated really quickly because they didn't have the resources that you had in order to fight it.
[00:50:50.402 --> 00:50:58.989]  And the fact that you put up a wall that stopped them for so long, I mean, I think they were very much afraid of going to trial.
[00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:02.132]  I mean, there's a reason that they came begging for a settlement.
[00:51:02.132 --> 00:51:09.678]  And there's a reason that they took such a tiny amount when, you know, a couple weeks ago, they had their chest puffed out with seven figures in front of you.
[00:51:11.282 --> 00:51:20.672]  So, look, I would say that this should be a good warning to anybody who wants to come after you over politically motivated garbage like this.
[00:51:20.672 --> 00:51:25.577]  Yeah, you paid them a settlement, but this reminds me of the Battle of Bunker Hill.
[00:51:25.577 --> 00:51:28.640]  Technically, the British took that hill, but that was the end of the war for them.
[00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:39.410]  And I think that this should be a warning sign that anybody who wants to come for a politically motivated suit against you, you're willing to spend the money and spend the time and go to litigation.
[00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:47.174]  And if everybody out there wants to invest a million dollars to get $15,000, they're going to get a return of about 1.2 cents on the dollar.
[00:51:50.499 --> 00:51:51.640]  Go for it.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:56.582]  If Wilmer Hale can run a law firm that way, I would really... I totally agree.
[00:51:56.582 --> 00:51:57.943]  And Mark, here's my philosophy.
[00:51:57.943 --> 00:52:01.444]  If I go bankrupt and get shut down fighting, I'm going to sleep good at night.
[00:52:01.444 --> 00:52:04.386]  Anytime I think about rolling over, I literally can't sleep.
[00:52:04.386 --> 00:52:05.206]  I have panic attacks.
[00:52:05.206 --> 00:52:05.987]  I'll be honest.
[00:52:05.987 --> 00:52:07.627]  People ask, like, am I fearless?
[00:52:07.627 --> 00:52:08.488]  Yeah, I'm afraid of fear.
[00:52:09.208 --> 00:52:11.270]  And I think this is a real victory.
[00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.890]  It's why we did it.
[00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:16.653]  I didn't want to go in there frivolously over $15,000, have a whole trial and spend hundreds of thousands.
[00:52:16.653 --> 00:52:23.098]  And I knew they'd still lose, but then it would just be spun by the media and they'd probably have some nut, you know, shoot me in the parking lot or something.
[00:52:23.098 --> 00:52:24.999]  I had a bad feeling about the whole deal.
[00:52:24.999 --> 00:52:26.840]  So, you know, that's where this is going.
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.603]  But this is a big deal to show what these bullies are up to and what happens when you stand up to them.
[00:52:30.603 --> 00:52:31.604]  But I want to thank the listeners.
[00:52:32.364 --> 00:52:33.485]  We're good to go.
[00:53:03.545 --> 00:53:04.265]  Absolutely.
[00:53:04.265 --> 00:53:09.028]  So it was fantastic work by the Randazzo Law Firm, and the evidence of that is in the outcome.
[00:53:09.028 --> 00:53:24.116]  You rarely see any copyright suit go for a year in litigation with a big, powerful corporate copyright law firm prosecuting the case, willing to spend over a million dollars in legal fees, ever settle for a publicly disclosed $15,000.
[00:53:24.116 --> 00:53:31.280]  Sometimes they'll demand that these settlements be held secret or be held confidential, and so people infer these huge settlements that didn't happen.
[00:53:31.701 --> 00:53:34.282]  Here, you almost never see this outcome.
[00:53:34.282 --> 00:53:40.846]  And this outcome is only because of your willingness and your audience's willingness to support you and to back your defense.
[00:53:40.846 --> 00:53:51.572]  And because of that, the number one thing they have underestimated in the various people that have come after you, either politically or in the legal arena or elsewhere, is that they underestimate your audience.
[00:53:51.572 --> 00:53:53.293]  They underestimate your audience's commitment
[00:53:53.612 --> 00:53:56.614]  They underestimate your audience's intelligence.
[00:53:56.614 --> 00:54:04.459]  They underestimate your audience's willingness to support and back each other and you by what they do financially and otherwise.
[00:54:04.459 --> 00:54:06.460]  They assume that they can come out... You just said it!
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.302]  Benjamin Franklin said, hang together, hang separate.
[00:54:09.302 --> 00:54:13.405]  We've got the real Americana audience, and the tougher it gets, the more they're in there.
[00:54:14.457 --> 00:54:16.498]  And as long as we don't back down, they back us.
[00:54:16.498 --> 00:54:21.641]  They've been so pissed a few years ago, but I thought I was just saying an apology so I get left alone.
[00:54:21.641 --> 00:54:23.181]  I didn't get that it was the setup.
[00:54:23.181 --> 00:54:24.042]  My audience got it.
[00:54:24.042 --> 00:54:25.122]  They were pissed at me.
[00:54:25.122 --> 00:54:26.083]  Well, now I get it.
[00:54:26.083 --> 00:54:30.325]  Hey, audience, I'm not just physically not surrendering.
[00:54:30.325 --> 00:54:33.506]  Death before dishonor, I get what you're right.
[00:54:33.506 --> 00:54:36.968]  We're gonna raging bull, not back down to anything.
[00:54:36.968 --> 00:54:37.628]  And that's better.
[00:54:37.628 --> 00:54:39.189]  I don't have to even think things through now.
[00:54:39.189 --> 00:54:42.911]  I can just go with my instincts, be a raging bull, and it seems like that's the best way to go.
[00:54:44.221 --> 00:54:46.082]  Absolutely, and this outcome vindicates that.
[00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:49.483]  This is one of the most extraordinary outcomes ever.
[00:54:49.483 --> 00:54:53.445]  I'm writing a book on underdog, great underdog success cases in the law.
[00:54:53.445 --> 00:54:55.386]  And this will be one of those cases.
[00:54:55.386 --> 00:55:00.868]  And so you have the Randazzo firm, a small firm against this big, powerful corporate firm, all the political media.
[00:55:00.868 --> 00:55:03.789]  Is it WilmerHale, the biggest in the country?
[00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:04.729]  It's one of the big.
[00:55:04.729 --> 00:55:09.251]  It goes back and forth between them and Baker McKenzie and Skadden Arps and a few others.
[00:55:09.251 --> 00:55:10.692]  But one of the most powerful.
[00:55:10.692 --> 00:55:13.353]  I mean, they are Twitter's law firm, for example.
[00:55:13.786 --> 00:55:18.528]  So I've gone up against WilmerHale and other contacts, and they put five lawyers on there.
[00:55:18.528 --> 00:55:20.788]  There were going to be four to five lawyers there.
[00:55:20.788 --> 00:55:26.711]  That's $7,000 to $8,000 an hour being incurred for this potential trial.
[00:55:26.711 --> 00:55:29.472]  That's how much money they'd already spent on the case.
[00:55:29.472 --> 00:55:32.293]  And they had spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on the case.
[00:55:32.293 --> 00:55:35.334]  So you're talking about this massive effort to crush you.
[00:55:35.334 --> 00:55:41.956]  And because your audience put up that final wall, that last wall, that real wall, they were unable to breach that wall.
[00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:46.384]  And when they realized it, they'd wave the white flag and said, bye bye.
[00:55:46.384 --> 00:55:55.338]  And nobody else is going to be willing to, no competent, intelligent lawyer or other people are going to look at this, or political people are going to look at this and say, this is a smart strategy.
[00:55:55.632 --> 00:56:01.238]  This audience is much stronger than we thought, much smarter than we thought, much more willing to fight than we thought.
[00:56:01.238 --> 00:56:08.404]  Well, I kept wondering why, over the last four or five years, always the exact amount of money we need comes in to keep operating.
[00:56:08.404 --> 00:56:10.887]  Like, why is it always the exact amount?
[00:56:10.887 --> 00:56:14.731]  And it's like God's literally telling me, I'm in control, you're in my hands.
[00:56:14.731 --> 00:56:16.132]  This has been an amazing time.
[00:56:16.132 --> 00:56:17.894]  Rondazzo, you want to add any other comments to this?
[00:56:19.182 --> 00:56:27.647]  I just, I have a very big feeling of satisfaction when they put as many lawyers on the other side of the table as I have in my entire firm.
[00:56:27.647 --> 00:56:38.014]  And then they squeak out the door with a, you know, essentially it was like you flipped a coin to them and said, here kid, get out of my way, go buy yourself an ice cream.
[00:56:38.014 --> 00:56:40.255]  Well, compared to what the costs are, it's true.
[00:56:40.255 --> 00:56:42.796]  I just, it's the hysteria.
[00:56:42.796 --> 00:56:44.878]  I was in a Mexican food restaurant Saturday night.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:49.503]  And I was shaking hands, doing autographs with most people in there, and I walked out.
[00:56:49.503 --> 00:56:51.104]  This guy goes, F you.
[00:56:51.104 --> 00:56:51.865]  I didn't turn around.
[00:56:51.865 --> 00:56:54.107]  And he goes, F your family.
[00:56:54.107 --> 00:56:54.867]  And I shouldn't have done it.
[00:56:54.867 --> 00:56:55.628]  I leaned in toward him.
[00:56:55.628 --> 00:56:57.569]  I said, come outside.
[00:56:57.569 --> 00:56:58.630]  And then he wouldn't get up.
[00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:00.231]  And then his buddy said, I'll kick your ass.
[00:57:00.231 --> 00:57:01.192]  I said, both of you, let's go.
[00:57:01.192 --> 00:57:01.832]  And then he wouldn't get up.
[00:57:01.832 --> 00:57:02.933]  They were shaking.
[00:57:02.933 --> 00:57:04.835]  And I said, man, I'm not the toughest guy around, dude.
[00:57:04.835 --> 00:57:07.457]  But you literally said, F my family.
[00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:10.679]  Your mouth needs to stop writing checks you can't cash.
[00:57:10.679 --> 00:57:12.280]  But that's this modern world with these guys.
[00:57:13.001 --> 00:57:14.521]  They think it's all like posing.
[00:57:14.521 --> 00:57:15.682]  They don't get it's the real world.
[00:57:15.682 --> 00:57:18.843]  And I think that's with the Hillary worshipers and the rest of them.
[00:57:18.843 --> 00:57:21.883]  They don't get that it's coming to rubber meets the road.
[00:57:21.883 --> 00:57:25.544]  And there are a lot of people in this world aren't backing down, aren't giving in.
[00:57:25.544 --> 00:57:30.006]  And we've got the audience of activists that have got the big brass huevos.
[00:57:30.006 --> 00:57:32.306]  And we don't just thank them.
[00:57:32.306 --> 00:57:33.287]  I worship God, number one.
[00:57:33.287 --> 00:57:34.107]  But I tell you, our audience...
[00:57:34.967 --> 00:57:38.169]  When you're like a raft floating on the ocean, man, you love that raft.
[00:57:38.169 --> 00:57:38.849]  I love you guys.
[00:57:38.849 --> 00:57:39.930]  I really appreciate you.
[00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:41.410]  And you two, both you men did a great job.
[00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:47.814]  Let's briefly talk about the New York Times cover story declaring the next phase of the attack on the First Amendment.
[00:57:49.713 --> 00:58:00.777]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:09.640]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:13.661]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[00:58:14.341 --> 00:58:20.805]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[00:58:20.805 --> 00:58:22.986]  And you may be experiencing back up too.
[00:58:22.986 --> 00:58:28.909]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy Powder.

[01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:14.935]  It's the Alex Jones Show!

[01:00:20.769 --> 01:00:22.050]  That doesn't mean we don't make mistakes.
[01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:24.851]  My God, only a few percentage points out of a hundred.
[01:00:24.851 --> 01:00:26.712]  I wish I was wrong.
[01:00:26.712 --> 01:00:35.436]  Finishing up here with constitutional lawyers and first amendment lawyers and all around whiz kids, Bob Barnes and Mark Randazzo.
[01:00:35.436 --> 01:00:39.198]  Cover page of the New York Times admitting that they plan to take
[01:00:40.163 --> 01:00:50.172]  Even mainline gay liberals off the internet who don't support censorship of conservatives claiming we're all dangerous brainwashers.
[01:00:50.172 --> 01:00:52.154]  They've got me right there front and center.
[01:00:52.154 --> 01:00:53.775]  Paul Watson front and center.
[01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:54.956]  Mark, you want to take this first?
[01:00:54.956 --> 01:00:56.738]  I mean, this is just getting insane.
[01:00:56.738 --> 01:00:59.540]  Trump's got to act on this.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.402]  Well, you know, I'm sorry, but I don't think he's going to.
[01:01:02.402 --> 01:01:04.024]  I mean, he's had
[01:01:04.801 --> 01:01:08.662]  He's had command of the antitrust division of the Department of Justice for three years.
[01:01:08.662 --> 01:01:10.743]  He's done nothing about online censorship.
[01:01:10.743 --> 01:01:17.485]  I mean, I hate to say it on this show, but it seems like the only candidate I've heard from who has any, you know, any cojones.
[01:01:17.485 --> 01:01:18.385]  Elizabeth Warren?
[01:01:18.385 --> 01:01:19.766]  Elizabeth Warren, yeah.
[01:01:19.766 --> 01:01:26.628]  I mean, she's at least said she'd be willing to come down into Silicon Valley like Teddy Roosevelt and start breaking up the company.
[01:01:26.628 --> 01:01:29.449]  So why are they overwhelmingly supporting her then?
[01:01:29.449 --> 01:01:30.309]  Couldn't that be a feint?
[01:01:32.327 --> 01:01:33.210]  Oh, I don't think so.
[01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:36.318]  No, I think she's sincere about it.
[01:01:36.318 --> 01:01:38.264]  Oh, you think they're kissing her ass because they're scared of her?
[01:01:39.258 --> 01:01:39.738]  I think so.
[01:01:39.738 --> 01:01:42.640]  I mean, if she gets elected, I think she will at least try.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:49.124]  I just don't know that she's going to appoint the kind of people who have the backbone to do it.
[01:01:49.124 --> 01:01:51.906]  Well, I agree with you that Trump's talk is cheap.
[01:01:51.906 --> 01:01:52.206]  I agree.
[01:01:52.206 --> 01:01:53.447]  I'm going to come back with a comment on that.
[01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:54.408]  But Barnes, what do you think?
[01:01:54.408 --> 01:01:56.889]  Because Trump's now said he's going to go after Twitter.
[01:01:56.889 --> 01:01:57.910]  They better watch out.
[01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:59.431]  He says antitrust is coming.
[01:01:59.431 --> 01:02:02.813]  I mean, I mean, I agree with Mark.
[01:02:02.813 --> 01:02:03.573]  He's waited too long.
[01:02:03.573 --> 01:02:05.815]  But I actually think he's getting his engines fired up.
[01:02:07.278 --> 01:02:19.102]  Well, I think, I mean, yesterday he signaled his response to the New York Times by, by precisely, by publicly for the first time saying that they need, that Twitter in particular needs to reinstate free speech.
[01:02:19.102 --> 01:02:25.864]  And so we'll see in the past, his escalation has been personal meetings like he did with Jack at Twitter when you were up there.
[01:02:25.864 --> 01:02:33.447]  Then after that, he does, and whether he timed that deliberately or not, at least it was helpful from a public perception perspective.
[01:02:33.447 --> 01:02:36.188]  And then on top of that, he's now taking the second action,
[01:02:36.807 --> 01:02:38.509]  Well, that pattern is correct, and I hope you're right.
[01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:39.449]  Mark Randazzo, what do you think?
[01:03:06.259 --> 01:03:13.741]  I think that until we have some real motion out of him, I'm not going to give him credit for anything yet.
[01:03:13.741 --> 01:03:22.663]  I think he's shown spine when it comes to international trade deals, but he's not shown that spine when it comes to cracking the whip on the 650 area code.
[01:03:22.663 --> 01:03:26.324]  And I think it's time that he does that.
[01:03:26.324 --> 01:03:26.964]  I agree, Bob.
[01:03:28.604 --> 01:03:29.244]  No doubt.
[01:03:29.244 --> 01:03:30.085]  It has to happen.
[01:03:30.085 --> 01:03:31.285]  I mean, this is accelerating.
[01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:37.967]  When the New York Times runs a front page, Sunday New York Times front page piece that is entirely a fake hit piece.
[01:03:37.967 --> 01:03:41.689]  Because who's been radicalized over the past five years is entirely the left.
[01:03:41.689 --> 01:03:43.069]  The right hasn't been radicalized at all.
[01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.450]  They have the same opinions they had 50 years ago.
[01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:47.371]  The left, parts of the left used to agree with them.
[01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:55.594]  On immigration, on issues of censorship, on issues of free speech, on issues of the dangers of politicized, radicalized Islam.
[01:03:55.594 --> 01:03:57.315]  Over at the left, this is the one that's gone nuts.
[01:03:57.315 --> 01:04:11.120]  There's a wide range of studies on this that have been released over the past several years, including by the ANES survey institution, where 10% of white liberals just five years ago agreed with the idea of open borders, and now a majority do.
[01:04:11.536 --> 01:04:16.859]  So what's happening is the mainstream media, it's all been said by clickbait from the mainstream press.
[01:04:16.859 --> 01:04:22.802]  They're becoming completely radicalized while telling those of us that are still sane that we're bad.
[01:04:22.802 --> 01:04:23.223]  Great points.
[01:04:23.223 --> 01:04:25.784]  I hope you'll both come back for a full hour separate and together.
[01:04:25.784 --> 01:04:26.825]  You're always amazing.
[01:04:26.825 --> 01:04:27.765]  Gasolisters love you.
[01:04:27.765 --> 01:04:28.966]  Mark Rendazzo, final comment.
[01:04:30.459 --> 01:04:41.343]  Look, the thing you were saying earlier about how your viewers and your listeners helped out in order to help you win this free speech fight, I can't reiterate that enough.
[01:04:41.343 --> 01:04:47.344]  When you have stood up on these cases, you're not standing up just for Alex Jones or InfoWars.
[01:04:47.344 --> 01:04:50.345]  You're standing up for everybody's rights.
[01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:56.247]  Now that this case is over, you can kind of start reloading the guns, but there's going to be more.
[01:04:56.247 --> 01:04:57.388]  You know that.
[01:04:57.388 --> 01:04:57.888]  Well said.

[01:06:06.051 --> 01:06:10.375]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:15.340]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:29.193]  You know, I was just sent a Daily Caller article talking about how the New York Times just hit a new low with their call for just banning even mainline milk toast.
[01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:38.530]  Libertarian liberals like Dave Rubin, calling him a brainwasher, basically a white supremacist.
[01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:40.810]  Here's a document cam shot for TV viewers.
[01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:48.232]  In the article, it's a perfect photo though, of the late Senator John McCain, Nancy Pelosi, a few other senators, John Kerry.
[01:06:48.232 --> 01:06:51.913]  They look like a bunch of ghouls.
[01:06:51.913 --> 01:06:54.514]  And if you zoom in on that, you can look at the power trip.
[01:06:54.514 --> 01:06:56.455]  There you go, pull it up.
[01:06:56.455 --> 01:06:57.555]  Look at the power trip.
[01:06:58.726 --> 01:07:03.468]  On their faces, the weird clickism.
[01:07:03.468 --> 01:07:05.029]  Zoom in on that more.
[01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:13.413]  They look like total and complete psychotics.
[01:07:13.413 --> 01:07:21.037]  If you were a little kid and you saw a movie poster walking into a movie theater, and it would say like, the bad guys, or it'd say the good guys, you'd look up, those look like bad guys.
[01:07:23.072 --> 01:07:24.413]  It's insane.
[01:07:24.413 --> 01:07:33.919]  Now, the reason I cover this New York Times article is the New York Times attacks me every week, sometimes five times a day.
[01:07:33.919 --> 01:07:44.727]  And they have incredible scams on there where they'll say, Jones created the illusion that something called globalism exists when it doesn't exist.
[01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:49.070]  It's a white supremacist fever swamp made up thing.
[01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:50.971]  That was two months after Trump was in office.
[01:07:52.725 --> 01:07:53.766]  Does globalism exist?
[01:07:53.766 --> 01:07:56.769]  I think was the headline.
[01:07:56.769 --> 01:08:01.333]  Davos and the Bilderberg Group and the UN call themselves globalists.
[01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:09.000]  Globalist just means big megacorporations and power elite, exempt from all the laws, playing countries off against each other and exploiting the people.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.842]  It's crony capitalism.
[01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:14.545]  It's the purest form of fascism the world's ever seen.
[01:08:14.545 --> 01:08:19.410]  And it uses communist states like China to be its teeth, to just chew up human populations.
[01:08:22.329 --> 01:08:25.415]  And it's like Hillary called Pepper the frog white supremacist when nobody was saying that.
[01:08:26.286 --> 01:08:32.431]  It makes it that, or saying, if you don't want global government and foreign banks running your country, why you don't like Jews?
[01:08:32.431 --> 01:08:38.135]  Really, Goldman Sachs and the Rothschild groups and all these groups are trying to shut down Israel.
[01:08:38.135 --> 01:08:40.497]  They're trying to get rid of Benjamin Netanyahu.
[01:08:40.497 --> 01:08:41.698]  They want world government.
[01:08:41.698 --> 01:08:43.039]  Some are Jews, some are whatever.
[01:08:43.039 --> 01:08:44.860]  The point is, they're globalists.
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:48.183]  The Chai Kams are the biggest globalists there are.
[01:08:48.183 --> 01:08:49.984]  Because that's a fact.
[01:08:49.984 --> 01:08:51.626]  They own most of our debt.
[01:08:51.626 --> 01:08:52.867]  They bought up Hollywood.
[01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:53.507]  That's a fact.
[01:08:55.247 --> 01:09:04.431]  But the white supremacists that are mainly synthetic on a short leash from the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL, oh, they tell you, I'm the traitor, you see.
[01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:05.712]  I'm the first to be banned.
[01:09:05.712 --> 01:09:06.892]  I'm the most banned.
[01:09:06.892 --> 01:09:08.073]  I'm the most lied about.
[01:09:08.073 --> 01:09:14.615]  And then the final coup de gras is that I'm working for Israel.
[01:09:14.615 --> 01:09:17.937]  Because I don't blame Israel for everything, because that's a distraction.
[01:09:20.247 --> 01:09:25.752]  Are there leftist NGOs in Israel flooding Europe with islamicists that they would never bring into Israel?
[01:09:25.752 --> 01:09:26.233]  Damn right!
[01:09:26.233 --> 01:09:28.595]  Do those leftists hate America?
[01:09:28.595 --> 01:09:29.396]  Damn right!
[01:09:29.396 --> 01:09:34.161]  But they're just like a black leftist or a brown leftist or a Christian leftist or a whatever leftist.
[01:09:34.161 --> 01:09:34.922]  They're leftist!
[01:09:34.922 --> 01:09:42.229]  And that's why the Israel thing becomes this mental illness that sucks all the oxygen out of the room and is stupid!
[01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:45.590]  But it's the same thing.
[01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:52.496]  You got the Vatican runs it all, or the Freemasons run it all, or, oh look, Jones did the A-OK symbol.
[01:09:52.496 --> 01:09:53.717]  It's Illuminati.
[01:09:53.717 --> 01:09:54.979]  It's mental illness.
[01:09:57.642 --> 01:10:06.246]  You judge someone by what they produce, what they stand for, for their track record.
[01:10:06.246 --> 01:10:17.150]  My track record is victory for free market and individuals, because that's my stated goal, and I preach it, and it's the truth, and it's successful.
[01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:23.533]  The only manipulation can be at a subconscious level, and I'm going to Paul Watson for the next three segments, or this segment, the next.
[01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:41.935]  Is that I was in love with free market, in love with America, and in love with success, and in love with thousands of different angles and ideas, and I knew that free market wasn't perfect, but it gave you hundreds of medical choices, hundreds of education choices, thousands, thousands of choices of everything!
[01:10:43.564 --> 01:10:49.129]  And then I went to third world countries, and I went to communist countries, and I witnessed it, and they'd had two pairs of clothes!
[01:10:49.129 --> 01:10:52.332]  They didn't have toilet paper to wipe their asses!
[01:10:52.332 --> 01:10:56.615]  Even though they had 130 IQs on average in Russia!
[01:10:56.615 --> 01:10:58.217]  Some of the highest IQs in the world!
[01:10:58.217 --> 01:11:02.120]  They couldn't wipe their ass!
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.144]  Because they were under globalism, a system meant to dominate and control them.
[01:11:07.144 --> 01:11:09.266]  Oh, the globalists took over Russia in 1917.
[01:11:11.038 --> 01:11:16.543]  They turned it from the country it was to the country it is, and then they went back to the country they were, but in a modern fashion.
[01:11:16.543 --> 01:11:21.768]  So when you hear it's a Russian conspiracy against the New World Order, it's true!
[01:11:21.768 --> 01:11:23.409]  The Russians don't direct this.
[01:11:23.409 --> 01:11:25.271]  We don't talk to them.
[01:11:25.271 --> 01:11:27.973]  The Russians can barely keep their country from the globalists.
[01:11:27.973 --> 01:11:32.377]  But they were the first in the 20th century and the 21st century.
[01:11:33.951 --> 01:11:40.098]  Right as the dawn of the new millennium began to throw some of the oligarchs off their back.
[01:11:40.098 --> 01:11:45.684]  And that example, if you let one ant stand up, they might all stand up.
[01:11:45.684 --> 01:11:49.068]  But America always does it bigger and better, don't we?
[01:11:49.068 --> 01:11:52.512]  We adopt whatever is successful, and we do it bigger and better.
[01:11:52.512 --> 01:11:53.873]  And we saw what Russia did.
[01:11:55.026 --> 01:11:57.287]  We saw all the other victories.
[01:11:57.287 --> 01:11:59.468]  We said, we can do it better than that.
[01:11:59.468 --> 01:12:02.049]  And so I was there betting on that the whole time.
[01:12:02.049 --> 01:12:08.411]  And along came Donald Trump, a beautiful opportunist.
[01:12:08.411 --> 01:12:09.872]  By the way, I'm an opportunist.
[01:12:09.872 --> 01:12:12.973]  I'm a trailblazer, too, but I'm everything.
[01:12:12.973 --> 01:12:15.514]  I'm evil, too, but good runs my life.
[01:12:15.514 --> 01:12:19.535]  God's in control of me, but I can see in every avenue.
[01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:23.297]  And I remember, like, being in high school and some guy's being a jerk to his hot girlfriend.
[01:12:24.295 --> 01:12:25.855]  Or Colin, treating her like crap.
[01:12:25.855 --> 01:12:26.716]  She's leaving the party.
[01:12:26.716 --> 01:12:29.956]  I'm like, hey sweetheart, I'm not going to be mean to you.
[01:12:29.956 --> 01:12:32.757]  I'm going to make you feel good.
[01:12:32.757 --> 01:12:34.958]  And I'm not bragging like I'm some Casanova.
[01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:36.438]  I just like girls.
[01:12:36.438 --> 01:12:37.338]  I'm better today.
[01:12:37.338 --> 01:12:40.159]  I'm married, got four kids, but you know, I was an opportunist.
[01:12:40.159 --> 01:12:47.201]  I'm like, buddy, you won't treat her bad because she's so good looking and you got a problem and you're upset because whatever, you're so jealous.
[01:12:47.201 --> 01:12:48.941]  You've got a girl that's hot.
[01:12:48.941 --> 01:12:49.801]  I'm not going to be jealous.
[01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:51.962]  I'm going to take good care of her.
[01:12:51.962 --> 01:12:52.782]  So yeah, I'm an opportunist.
[01:12:53.874 --> 01:13:02.821]  And I see the globalists crapping all over everything, wanting to dumb people down, wanting to poison people, wanting to turn us against each other so they can run us.
[01:13:02.821 --> 01:13:09.606]  What type of powerful leader wants to dumb a bunch of people down and confuse them and screw them up so you can rule them?
[01:13:09.606 --> 01:13:11.908]  That doesn't make you a god king!
[01:13:11.908 --> 01:13:15.531]  That doesn't even make you a warlord!
[01:13:15.531 --> 01:13:17.012]  That makes you a piece of crap!
[01:13:18.345 --> 01:13:26.507]  And so I'll never be with those people, not in a trillion years, because they're losers!
[01:13:26.507 --> 01:13:30.488]  And I'm going to kick their ass up one side of the street and down the other.
[01:13:30.488 --> 01:13:32.369]  If they destroy me, I win.
[01:13:32.369 --> 01:13:34.350]  If I beat them, I win.
[01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:44.953]  I don't lose because I'm focused on justice and truth and Americana, and I think it's sexy, and I'm in love with it, and I'm having sex with Americana.
[01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:46.073]  I'm in love with it.
[01:13:46.733 --> 01:13:55.356]  It's like a big sexy woman with all the curves and all the power and the thunder shooting out from between them thighs, baby!
[01:13:55.356 --> 01:14:13.581]  And I want to take this country, and I want its ideas to take the world over for freedom, and I want the planet to explode with human activity, and I want to spread throughout the cosmos, and I want our... Prodigy to look back on us and say, we're winners in one constant connection.
[01:14:14.631 --> 01:14:23.298]  And thank God our ancestors got us through that crap and got us off the ground so we could have communion with God in the stars and beyond.
[01:14:23.298 --> 01:14:24.579]  And that's God's plan.
[01:14:24.579 --> 01:14:25.800]  It's already going to happen.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.463]  Let me tell you, the devil's going to have his hour of power.
[01:14:29.463 --> 01:14:30.724]  It's going to be hellish.
[01:14:30.724 --> 01:14:32.265]  Billions are going to get killed in the end.
[01:14:32.265 --> 01:14:34.607]  But let me tell you something, sweetheart.
[01:14:34.607 --> 01:14:41.853]  You don't think God created this planet so people like Nancy Pelosi and Lord Rothschild and the Queen of England would be running the show, do you?
[01:14:43.595 --> 01:14:45.336]  They were only there to test us.
[01:14:45.336 --> 01:14:48.418]  We're going to go to break, come back to Paul Watson.
[01:14:48.418 --> 01:14:49.279]  I'm going to leave it at this.
[01:14:49.279 --> 01:15:06.031]  In fact, without even getting into the big specials, the big sales, and all the rest of it, if you want to see war against tyranny, if you want to see commitment, if you want to see 10 new reporters hired, and you want to see us even more effective, hell, you've seen what we've done with all the other great reporters and the Millie Weavers and the Caitlin Bennetts and the Owen Schroyers and everything we're doing.
[01:15:07.142 --> 01:15:08.703]  That energized me.
[01:15:08.703 --> 01:15:09.985]  Because I want to throw my fist.
[01:15:09.985 --> 01:15:14.629]  You ever have those dreams where you want to throw your fist at somebody but you can't hit them hard?
[01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:17.211]  And it just doesn't do anything?
[01:15:17.211 --> 01:15:22.737]  Here's my fist, ready to ram down the throat of the globalist and tear their heart out.
[01:15:22.737 --> 01:15:23.758]  Politically.
[01:15:23.758 --> 01:15:24.138]  Lovingly.
[01:15:26.636 --> 01:15:32.499]  But only you can take this fist from not being able to move, to focusing, getting ready, and then energizing.
[01:15:32.499 --> 01:15:38.583]  And I'll reach right down their throat, grab their heart, and I'll tear it out, even if they shove a sword into me.
[01:15:38.583 --> 01:15:43.546]  But I want the victory when they shove that sword in me, you understand that?
[01:15:43.546 --> 01:15:45.487]  I want victory over them!
[01:15:45.487 --> 01:15:48.549]  We will crush their spirit with Jesus Christ's power!
[01:15:48.549 --> 01:15:52.351]  We are unstoppable, but you must loose it now!
[01:15:52.351 --> 01:15:54.352]  Loose it!
[01:15:54.352 --> 01:15:54.833]  Loose it!
[01:15:57.492 --> 01:15:59.013]  Oh, these pains.
[01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:01.556]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:03.377]  I've got to get some relief.

[01:16:56.809 --> 01:17:03.152]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:06.194]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:17:06.194 --> 01:17:12.117]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:17:12.117 --> 01:17:15.919]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:17:15.919 --> 01:17:17.179]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:17:17.179 --> 01:17:18.520]  Who do we fight for?
[01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:24.723]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:26.164]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:17:26.784 --> 01:17:29.426]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.

[01:17:58.117 --> 01:18:02.299]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:18:02.299 --> 01:18:03.359]  They are technocrats.
[01:18:03.359 --> 01:18:05.640]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:13.003]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:18:13.003 --> 01:18:14.884]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:18:14.884 --> 01:18:17.345]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:18:17.345 --> 01:18:19.426]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[01:18:19.986 --> 01:18:23.829]  To forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:18:23.829 --> 01:18:29.034]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:18:29.034 --> 01:18:38.041]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.

[01:20:24.337 --> 01:20:27.879]  Run on for a long time.
[01:20:27.879 --> 01:20:30.741]  Run on for a long time.
[01:20:30.741 --> 01:20:33.742]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:20:33.742 --> 01:20:36.164]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:20:38.354 --> 01:20:39.955]  You can have anything you want.
[01:20:39.955 --> 01:20:42.436]  You gotta be willing to pay for it.
[01:20:42.436 --> 01:20:45.298]  I want victory for the species.
[01:20:45.298 --> 01:20:49.960]  I want all the struggles we've been through not to die if this planet gets destroyed.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.621]  No.
[01:20:51.621 --> 01:20:53.802]  We will not die.
[01:20:53.802 --> 01:20:57.564]  That's real death if we die collectively.
[01:20:57.564 --> 01:21:00.166]  Now, I want to go to Paul Joseph Watts for the next two segments because
[01:21:01.499 --> 01:21:15.206]  This demarcation line of June 9th, 2019, yesterday, we're covering this on June 10th, 2019, Paul was on a well-deserved vacation, came back early to cover all this, from Spain.
[01:21:15.206 --> 01:21:17.568]  Front page of the New York Times.
[01:21:17.568 --> 01:21:20.829]  Now, the New York Times doesn't have its power anymore.
[01:21:20.829 --> 01:21:27.473]  It's disrespected, it's got the lowest ratings of trust, but from a criminology perspective,
[01:21:28.422 --> 01:21:48.767]  When they put Paul, not once, not twice, not three times, not four times, but five times his image in this, in a big full centerfold, five full pages, about how Paul Watson is Satan.
[01:21:48.767 --> 01:21:55.509]  He's a shaitan to the Muslims.
[01:21:55.509 --> 01:21:56.529]  Of course, I'm in there as well.
[01:21:58.373 --> 01:22:02.777]  But it's the insanity of them saying we're popular because of an algorithm.
[01:22:02.777 --> 01:22:06.180]  That's a fancy name Google uses.
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:10.363]  All an algorithm is is what people click on, they then serve it back to you.
[01:22:10.363 --> 01:22:24.655]  I love showing my daughter's baby bunny and hedgehog videos and kitten videos and I pair my phone to the TV or whatever and so you turn the TV on and it's the latest kitten videos.
[01:22:24.655 --> 01:22:26.357]  Or you go out in the garage where I work out,
[01:22:27.259 --> 01:22:30.300]  And it's fishing videos, because I love fishing videos.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:34.161]  I don't have time to fish, but I watch fishing videos.
[01:22:34.161 --> 01:22:35.902]  All over the world.
[01:22:35.902 --> 01:22:39.723]  And Google feeds me more fishing videos.
[01:22:39.723 --> 01:22:42.644]  Now, sometimes I'll look at an Alex Jones video.
[01:22:42.644 --> 01:22:44.045]  Suddenly I get more Alex Jones videos.
[01:22:44.045 --> 01:22:45.325]  It's the way it works.
[01:22:45.325 --> 01:22:46.946]  They've broken the algorithm.
[01:22:46.946 --> 01:22:50.427]  They had huge profit losses this year, and last year they had met because of it.
[01:22:50.427 --> 01:22:52.328]  That was in press releases two weeks ago.
[01:22:54.022 --> 01:22:59.566]  But it's the New York Times saying that an algorithm is why we were popular.
[01:22:59.566 --> 01:23:08.432]  It wasn't that we were smart, it wasn't that we made good points, it wasn't that people were rejecting them, it was that we were losers, but that the system made a mistake.
[01:23:08.432 --> 01:23:12.374]  Now the truth is, no algorithms can fix the New York Times or CNN.
[01:23:12.374 --> 01:23:17.037]  No algorithm can make people love Jack Dorsey.
[01:23:17.037 --> 01:23:18.738]  Or Oliver Darsey.
[01:23:18.738 --> 01:23:19.439]  Or any of these people.
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:28.170]  But what this signifies is Paul was called a dangerous person two weeks ago, a month ago, taken off Facebook, follows all the rules.
[01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:33.237]  And YouTube and Google said today, oh, we're going to ban all borderline information.
[01:23:33.237 --> 01:23:35.460]  So borderline means they can always move the borderline.
[01:23:36.701 --> 01:23:37.903]  That's how it works.
[01:23:37.903 --> 01:23:49.019]  And I watch Joe Rogan, who I like, and I watch, uh, what's his name, Dave Rubin, and all of them go, well, Paul Watson got banned, but he didn't violate the rules, or I watched Tim Poole.
[01:23:49.019 --> 01:23:50.321]  Oh, Paul didn't violate the rules!
[01:23:52.315 --> 01:23:53.556]  There are no rules.
[01:23:53.556 --> 01:23:59.061]  Once they agree to violate Section 230 and take things down that aren't criminal, there's no more free speech.
[01:23:59.061 --> 01:23:59.441]  It's done!
[01:23:59.441 --> 01:24:06.568]  And everyone thinks if they just play along and don't really support free speech all the way, they'll be the last to be eaten.
[01:24:06.568 --> 01:24:10.591]  Instead of us unionizing collectively just through speech and ideas.
[01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:15.514]  Not through some central system and saying, no, we act like a bunch of idiots.
[01:24:15.514 --> 01:24:18.175]  So Paul Watson joins us for this segment and the next.
[01:24:18.175 --> 01:24:21.196]  Paul, thanks for joining us, coming back early from your vacation.
[01:24:21.196 --> 01:24:25.197]  They admit this is the salvo to take you completely off Twitter, YouTube, everything.
[01:24:25.197 --> 01:24:28.498]  So like I told you, that's why I told you a couple years ago, hey, you need to start your own site.
[01:24:28.498 --> 01:24:31.979]  You need to start your own company out in England.
[01:24:31.979 --> 01:24:32.800]  You said, why?
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.101]  I just want to write five articles a day and do all that.
[01:24:35.101 --> 01:24:36.401]  You work 16 hours a day.
[01:24:36.401 --> 01:24:38.382]  And I said, Paul, it's not about the work.
[01:24:39.338 --> 01:24:41.921]  Big fish eat little fish, brother.
[01:24:41.921 --> 01:24:44.243]  So you launched Summit.News, great job.
[01:24:44.243 --> 01:24:48.668]  And now you agree, we talked this morning, you're going to have to start up a whole new deal, launch your own video site.
[01:24:48.668 --> 01:24:49.749]  Good, we'll support it.
[01:24:49.749 --> 01:24:55.536]  But brother, that's what real success does, is it replicates and it hands the baton, like Obi-Wan Kenobi to Luke Skywalker.
[01:24:55.536 --> 01:24:58.018]  And I'm not doing that with you, I'm doing it to everybody.
[01:24:58.018 --> 01:25:00.982]  Everybody has to get involved, so I'm not lecturing you while you're here.
[01:25:02.031 --> 01:25:02.691]  I got you on late.
[01:25:02.691 --> 01:25:03.432]  We'll take the rest of the hour.
[01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:04.592]  We got to do this.
[01:25:04.592 --> 01:25:07.713]  You've got to commit to this, and I understand it.
[01:25:07.713 --> 01:25:10.254]  You just want to get the truth out, but you're going to be censored.
[01:25:10.254 --> 01:25:12.115]  You're going to have to build your own system.
[01:25:12.115 --> 01:25:16.296]  So we'll get to that later, but let's get into this latest declaration of war.
[01:25:16.296 --> 01:25:20.858]  Because, yeah, they don't have any power anymore, but it's a view into their mindset.
[01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:27.823]  They don't have power over minds, but they have power over the tech, over the architecture, over the wires, over the zeros and ones.
[01:25:27.823 --> 01:25:31.726]  And so they are declaring war on you like they did on me.
[01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:32.686]  And so what is that like?
[01:25:32.686 --> 01:25:35.709]  Because normally this is reserved for countries that are about to be invaded.
[01:25:35.709 --> 01:25:38.431]  How does it feel?
[01:25:38.431 --> 01:25:43.234]  Well, it feels quite common at this point, Alex, because it's happened everywhere else.
[01:25:43.234 --> 01:25:45.076]  What I think is going to happen with YouTube is
[01:25:46.044 --> 01:25:54.770]  Basically, you're going to be able to get on there and be somewhat independent if you have less than, say, 100,000 subscribers, but the algorithm is going to completely bury you.
[01:25:54.770 --> 01:26:09.339]  YouTube wants to be the next Netflix, so anyone who becomes somewhat popular on YouTube will then be forced to sign up with a giant umbrella corporation that has a partnership with YouTube that ensures their content is
[01:26:09.879 --> 01:26:12.540]  Family-friendly and advertiser-friendly.
[01:26:12.540 --> 01:26:17.601]  That's how they're going to drown out all the upcoming independent voices over the next few years.
[01:26:17.601 --> 01:26:18.741]  Obviously, I'm going to be banned.
[01:26:18.741 --> 01:26:20.082]  Crowder's going to be banned.
[01:26:20.082 --> 01:26:22.222]  Anyone who is affected is going to be banned.
[01:26:22.222 --> 01:26:23.362]  That's just a fact at this point.
[01:26:23.362 --> 01:26:24.923]  That's the way it's heading.
[01:26:24.923 --> 01:26:31.324]  The other thing is, this isn't just about the far-left demonising their political adversaries.
[01:26:31.324 --> 01:26:33.845]  Yes, it's partly about that, but it's also about money.
[01:26:33.845 --> 01:26:36.065]  We've got two headlines out today.
[01:26:36.065 --> 01:26:37.986]  HBO cancels Vice News Tonight.
[01:26:38.792 --> 01:26:41.816]  Far left ThinkProgress website in deep financial trouble.
[01:26:41.816 --> 01:26:43.698]  They're 3 million in the hole.
[01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:49.165]  You've got CNN laying off their entire London bureau, laying off their entire health bureau.
[01:26:49.165 --> 01:26:53.771]  You've got Vice having to take 200 billion in debt from George Soros.
[01:26:53.771 --> 01:26:54.712]  Or 200 million, sorry.
[01:26:55.592 --> 01:27:02.733]  They are going bust, so they are using this deplatforming to eliminate their competition.
[01:27:02.733 --> 01:27:03.373]  That's the point.
[01:27:03.373 --> 01:27:07.834]  It has nothing to do with hate, harassment, doxing and violence.
[01:27:07.834 --> 01:27:24.137]  Because as we've documented Alex, Conservatives have been the primary victims for the past 3-4 years of hate, harassment, doxing and violence, primarily from the same mainstream media which is now trying to deplatform us under those very same terms.
[01:27:24.598 --> 01:27:28.255]  And that just happened a few days ago with the creator of the
[01:27:29.119 --> 01:27:58.290]  parody Nancy Pelosi video on Facebook where they hunted him down they revealed his identity where he lived and this was the mainstream media doxing and engaging in harassment against a private individual against their own journalistic standards and training which is to minimize harm against individuals private individuals what they're doing now is maximizing harm and that's why we see the harassment doxing of conservatives over and over again
[01:27:59.076 --> 01:28:07.558]  We saw it with the Covington kids, we saw it with Pamela Geller's daughters, and we saw it with the creator of the Donald Trump wrestling gif.
[01:28:07.558 --> 01:28:08.339]  And it goes on and on.
[01:28:08.339 --> 01:28:20.882]  Dying corporate media, we're going to come back and talk about this, their only position now with no viewers is to at least be the distractionary diversion of big tech to basically call for our political execution.
[01:28:20.882 --> 01:28:27.484]  So that's their final act, their final paycheck, because they're going to be shut down, they're being shut down while this purge happens.
[01:28:31.718 --> 01:28:35.820]  We'll talk with Paul Watson on the other side about that, but understand that.
[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:41.802]  As they shut down their competition, the corporates then shut them down as fast as they shut us down.
[01:28:41.802 --> 01:28:48.065]  It's like IBM folks 20 years ago in Austin were hiring Indians from India to replace them.
[01:28:48.065 --> 01:28:51.606]  And that's exactly what's going on now.
[01:28:51.606 --> 01:28:56.108]  Fox and Vice are just trying to get rid of their competition before they're shut down.

[01:33:01.334 --> 01:33:04.116]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:04.116 --> 01:33:04.897]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:04.897 --> 01:33:10.741]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.059 --> 01:33:25.981]  By the way, we never tried to gonzo journalism ourselves into the lead characters in this fight for humanity.
[01:33:25.981 --> 01:33:29.342]  But we just believed in humanity and doggedly fought.
[01:33:29.342 --> 01:33:40.285]  And so myself, Paul Wyson, masterminds like Drudge, who's able to stay out of the fray but still do great work, it's just incredible.
[01:33:40.285 --> 01:33:44.406]  Matt Drudge hardly ever even links to us.
[01:33:44.406 --> 01:33:45.146]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:33:45.146 --> 01:33:47.587]  When he does link to us, it's always the most important story.
[01:33:49.741 --> 01:33:51.923]  That I don't even recognize is the most important story.
[01:33:51.923 --> 01:34:01.514]  Like for days, it's linked up on Drudge, our article about people coming in from Congo, infested with Ebola, scared they've got Ebola.
[01:34:01.514 --> 01:34:02.795]  It's not hundreds, it's thousands.
[01:34:02.795 --> 01:34:03.977]  I talked to the Border Patrol today.
[01:34:03.977 --> 01:34:07.360]  And I was talking to the Border Patrol like 8 a.m.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:07.741]  this morning.
[01:34:10.145 --> 01:34:23.688]  They're like, yeah, no, you know, we like you, Alex, but we went to Fox first, and we went to Glenn Beck, and we went to, you know, everybody, and then got back with us, like, this is a pretty big deal, like, we think a thousand more is our estimate, just came across the last few days.
[01:34:23.688 --> 01:34:30.470]  We're pretty sure Ebola's gonna get into Texas, and this is the type of environment it's gonna spread in, is inside a refugee center.
[01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:36.792]  These people tell us they're fleeing Ebola, we don't even have beds for them.
[01:34:36.792 --> 01:34:38.412]  And I'm not wishing I had the scoop.
[01:34:40.219 --> 01:34:47.906]  I'm only getting the scoop because I'm like the ugly girl at the prom, you know, at the end of the night.
[01:34:47.906 --> 01:34:51.569]  The other girl's already gone home, but I guess I'll do whatever in the back of the truck.
[01:34:51.569 --> 01:34:55.293]  I mean, that's scary as hell.
[01:34:55.293 --> 01:35:03.140]  That the Border Patrol is all freaked out about this, and all this is going on, and it's us again.
[01:35:03.140 --> 01:35:04.922]  And then Drudge doesn't care we're the ugly girl.
[01:35:06.331 --> 01:35:08.132]  I don't mean that mean to other girls.
[01:35:08.132 --> 01:35:09.533]  All girls, I think, are pretty well aware of the other.
[01:35:09.533 --> 01:35:10.634]  You know what I mean.
[01:35:10.634 --> 01:35:14.637]  Drudge still links to us because he knows it's important, he knows it's real, and we have the proof.
[01:35:14.637 --> 01:35:16.759]  That's a scary thing, man.
[01:35:16.759 --> 01:35:22.082]  I don't want to be the guy that's always breaking stuff like this.
[01:35:22.082 --> 01:35:26.305]  Because that means there's not many of us, and that's scary.
[01:35:26.305 --> 01:35:30.348]  Yeah, it's on local news, but that's it.
[01:35:30.348 --> 01:35:33.691]  And Drudge has had it up there for two days, right in the middle column.
[01:35:34.847 --> 01:35:35.767]  And no coverage of it.
[01:35:35.767 --> 01:35:39.788]  Now, as soon as it gets covered and breaks, she'll take it down.
[01:35:39.788 --> 01:35:40.929]  But that's the genius of Drudge.
[01:35:40.929 --> 01:35:42.769]  He's forcing that story out.
[01:35:42.769 --> 01:35:43.209]  Well, don't worry.
[01:35:43.209 --> 01:35:48.591]  We've got reporters at the border and in San Antonio.
[01:35:48.591 --> 01:35:51.492]  And we're talking to these people with our French translation.
[01:35:51.492 --> 01:35:52.752]  Do you fear Ebola?
[01:35:52.752 --> 01:35:57.033]  Did you come here to escape Ebola in French?
[01:35:57.033 --> 01:36:02.115]  They're like, yes!
[01:36:02.115 --> 01:36:02.655]  Think about that.
[01:36:04.471 --> 01:36:09.574]  300 at one facility, 200 at another, a couple hundred at another, and that's what we know of.
[01:36:09.574 --> 01:36:12.236]  And the Border Patrol says, no.
[01:36:12.236 --> 01:36:13.577]  We don't have beds, facilities.
[01:36:13.577 --> 01:36:14.918]  We're so overwhelmed.
[01:36:14.918 --> 01:36:19.701]  5,000 a day.
[01:36:19.701 --> 01:36:20.501]  They're like, how's them?
[01:36:20.501 --> 01:36:20.841]  Oh, really?
[01:36:20.841 --> 01:36:23.363]  It's like saying 5,000 neighbors come to your house.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:25.401]  And you're three people.
[01:36:25.401 --> 01:36:31.584]  Have you ever had a party and too many people get called to it and you can't even get anybody fed?
[01:36:31.584 --> 01:36:34.246]  This is a collapse of civilization.
[01:36:34.246 --> 01:36:40.650]  Going back to Paul, I'll cover it after you're gone, Paul.
[01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:48.414]  No wonder they've got to censor everybody in Europe and here because you can't get away with crazy stuff like this if there's a free press.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:50.481]  What are your observations?
[01:36:50.481 --> 01:36:51.642]  You've got a lot of points to make.
[01:36:51.642 --> 01:36:52.203]  I'm running on here.
[01:36:52.203 --> 01:36:53.364]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:36:53.364 --> 01:36:56.667]  You'll host the fourth hour tomorrow, but Paul Watson of Summit.News.
[01:36:56.667 --> 01:37:00.110]  Well, what do we do to counter this?
[01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:01.591]  Well, we have to go analog, Alex.
[01:37:01.591 --> 01:37:02.612]  We have to go old school.
[01:37:02.612 --> 01:37:06.316]  I mean, I put out the announcement yesterday that I'm going to be doing
[01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:11.622]  More videos, but uploading them to alternative platforms that are not YouTube.
[01:37:11.622 --> 01:37:13.543]  Because we need to transition away from this.
[01:37:13.543 --> 01:37:15.284]  Everyone's gonna get banned anyway.
[01:37:15.284 --> 01:37:20.107]  Because the levels of hysteria have just reached new heights beyond anything anyone could imagine.
[01:37:20.954 --> 01:37:37.618]  In the New York Times article, The Making of a YouTube Radical, which by the way, they paint this picture of this like dark, dastardly, serious scenario where this guy becomes radicalized, becomes a member of the alt-right from watching YouTube videos.
[01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:42.900]  So what did he actually go on to do as a result of watching all these evil videos?
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:44.100]  Precisely nothing!
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:58.407]  He just watched some videos, and if you read the conclusion of the piece, you know, he didn't go on to try and shoot up a bunch of congressmen, like James T. Hodgkinson, who by the way was a big, you know, CNN Young Turks fan, nobody mentions that.
[01:37:58.407 --> 01:38:07.531]  He wasn't the P-69 shooter in San Francisco who planned to carry out a massacre, who was following Antifa Facebook pages, nobody talks about that.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:12.207]  He basically, by the end of the article, it says that he became a liberal.
[01:38:12.207 --> 01:38:16.934]  So he wasn't radicalizing the alt-right, he was radicalizing to the far left.
[01:38:16.934 --> 01:38:18.817]  And they use this term alt-right, Alex.
[01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:23.711]  The guy said he wasn't alt-right.
[01:38:23.711 --> 01:38:38.557]  In fact, it's now emerged on Twitter, he himself says, Caleb Cain, the subject of this New York Times smear piece on the rest of us, quote, I clearly state I was an alt-light civic nationalist in interviews.
[01:38:38.557 --> 01:38:40.918]  People have sent me his DMs.
[01:38:40.918 --> 01:38:43.219]  They've asked me not to release them, but in these DMs he says,
[01:38:44.016 --> 01:38:46.518]  No, I was never a member of the alt-right.
[01:38:46.518 --> 01:38:47.800]  I was alt-lying.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.864]  So surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise, the New York Times lied.
[01:38:52.864 --> 01:38:59.930]  And again, it's a classic communist tactic, authoritarian tactic, to capture somebody and then they come out and say, oh, the other side's bad.
[01:38:59.930 --> 01:39:10.380]  So that's all they've got, this one guy we've never heard of, he now comes out and says, and you read the quotes in here, it's like a five-page article, and it's got Laura Southern.
[01:39:11.815 --> 01:39:19.339]  The sexist, racist, homophobic narrative has been blown out of proportion and sensationalized, and everybody knows it.
[01:39:19.339 --> 01:39:28.965]  Yeah, you wrote an article today for Infowars.com, it should get out, where Facebook's banned the word honk, because people go honk, honk, clown world leftist.
[01:39:28.965 --> 01:39:30.025]  I've got articles.
[01:39:30.025 --> 01:39:35.748]  Philadelphia to ban balconies and bay windows, symbols of gentrification.
[01:39:35.748 --> 01:39:38.150]  Summer is now sexist, USA Today.
[01:39:38.150 --> 01:39:39.951]  Let me tell you, I bought
[01:39:41.064 --> 01:39:43.727]  A condo next to my parents.
[01:39:43.727 --> 01:39:44.588]  A few years ago.
[01:39:44.588 --> 01:39:49.913]  And I put it in my kids' names so they would have a place to go to college, because they all say they want to stay in Austin.
[01:39:49.913 --> 01:39:53.777]  And I've already got a 16-year-old son, who might be 17.
[01:39:53.777 --> 01:39:55.419]  And so, that's their condo.
[01:39:55.419 --> 01:39:58.222]  We leased it out now, but that's their condo.
[01:39:58.222 --> 01:40:01.606]  And the money we get from the condo rental goes to their trust for college.
[01:40:03.442 --> 01:40:07.263]  When they were building the condos, I said, why isn't there balconies?
[01:40:07.263 --> 01:40:08.404]  Why aren't there gates?
[01:40:08.404 --> 01:40:10.665]  And they said, oh, that's city zoning.
[01:40:10.665 --> 01:40:12.105]  And I checked and it's true.
[01:40:12.105 --> 01:40:16.487]  So when I read this, I already knew this three years ago when I bought the condo and they were building it.
[01:40:17.782 --> 01:40:24.884]  They literally don't let you have fences or balconies because they say it scares black people!
[01:40:24.884 --> 01:40:26.325]  As if that's even true!
[01:40:26.325 --> 01:40:27.165]  This is crazy!
[01:40:27.165 --> 01:40:29.526]  It's like, give me all your money or you're racist!
[01:40:29.526 --> 01:40:31.106]  It scares the black people!
[01:40:31.106 --> 01:40:36.448]  And this is like, leech, kook, level 12th dimensional freakdom, man!
[01:40:36.448 --> 01:40:46.131]  I mean, it's like, they just honk, honk is racist, balconies are racist, oh yeah, cauliflowers racist, even though it comes from Africa.
[01:40:46.131 --> 01:40:47.231]  What the hell?
[01:40:50.093 --> 01:40:54.077]  Well, that's the point about the honk honk, the clown world meme.
[01:40:54.077 --> 01:40:59.942]  All this stuff is so hysterical that to encapsulate it into a meme, you can only say that it's clown world.
[01:40:59.942 --> 01:41:03.785]  And then they try and ban the clown world meme on top of that!
[01:41:03.785 --> 01:41:06.908]  Going back to the New York Times piece, again, rampant hysteria.
[01:41:07.463 --> 01:41:27.557]  You scroll down the article, and all these images of these YouTubers show up, then they gradually disappear, and then when it gets down to the words, I was brainwashed, it shows just an image of Philip DeFranco, who is like a center-left, fence-sitting, Milko- Philip DeFranco attacks all of us constantly!
[01:41:27.557 --> 01:41:34.522]  Yeah, he- when you got de- But his- his crime is- his crime is- Sorry, I'm- I'm gonna let you talk.
[01:41:34.522 --> 01:41:35.643]  His crime is he's popular.
[01:41:35.643 --> 01:41:36.063]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:37.597 --> 01:41:45.281]  Yeah, so the entire premise of the article is wrong because the guy was never alt-right and admits to it on his own Twitter and his own DMs.
[01:41:45.281 --> 01:41:53.386]  And then they try and make this argument that Dave Rubin and Steven Crowder and myself are like gateway drugs to the alt-right extremists.
[01:41:53.386 --> 01:42:00.870]  And the sole remaining guy on the article as an example of an alt-right extremist is Philip DeFranco.
[01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:03.572]  It's just so ridiculous on the very face of it.
[01:42:05.365 --> 01:42:10.630]  But again, you know, this is what they used to then pressure YouTube to de-platform people.
[01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:14.314]  They had a Data Society report, which was again complete nonsense.
[01:42:14.314 --> 01:42:26.025]  The premise of the whole thing was completely debunked by people who read it, but then they present it to YouTube and YouTube says, oh, this serious foundation that's funded by George Soros says it, so it must be true.
[01:42:26.025 --> 01:42:27.346]  You actually drill down into it.
[01:42:28.047 --> 01:42:31.512]  And it's the height of absurdity every single time.
[01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:42.986]  There's a clear difference between being conservative and being alt-right, which means you believe in a white ethnostate, which I and you have never advocated, neither has Crowder Rubin or anyone else.
[01:42:42.986 --> 01:42:45.790]  But we don't want to live under an Islamic state or a leftist state either.
[01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:48.211]  Precisely.
[01:42:48.211 --> 01:42:49.712]  Then they take it a step further though.
[01:42:49.712 --> 01:42:57.456]  Now YouTube is deleting historical archive footage from 1930s Germany uploaded by history... Stay there, stay there.
[01:42:57.456 --> 01:42:58.057]  Finish that point.
[01:42:59.991 --> 01:43:03.172]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:43:03.172 --> 01:43:05.653]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[01:43:05.653 --> 01:43:07.614]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:43:07.614 --> 01:43:08.554]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:43:08.554 --> 01:43:09.014]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:09.014 --> 01:43:10.175]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:43:10.175 --> 01:43:12.395]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:43:12.395 --> 01:43:18.338]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[01:43:18.338 --> 01:43:20.278]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:43:20.278 --> 01:43:21.259]  God bless you, brother.
[01:43:21.259 --> 01:43:24.800]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:27.921]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[01:43:28.261 --> 01:43:29.361]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:43:29.361 --> 01:43:31.682]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:43:31.682 --> 01:43:34.423]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:43:57.601 --> 01:44:01.766]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:44:01.766 --> 01:44:12.179]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[01:44:12.179 --> 01:44:16.604]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[01:44:16.664 --> 01:44:17.405]  We're good to go.
[01:44:31.783 --> 01:44:49.377]  It's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[01:44:49.377 --> 01:44:56.083]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.

[01:46:17.171 --> 01:46:17.652]  Spreads the word.

[01:46:20.053 --> 01:46:22.254]  If we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.

[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:38.162]  TurboForce, which is just tanning our energy.
[01:46:38.162 --> 01:46:40.043]  Clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[01:46:40.043 --> 01:46:42.025]  Ultimate FemaleForce is incredible as well.
[01:46:42.025 --> 01:46:43.986]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[01:46:43.986 --> 01:46:46.808]  All of the Force products, it's got Force in the name.

[01:46:53.392 --> 01:46:57.055]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:47:00.862 --> 01:47:12.273]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.273 --> 01:47:16.497]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:47:16.497 --> 01:47:20.841]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:47:20.841 --> 01:47:21.361]  Something.
[01:47:21.361 --> 01:47:24.224]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[01:47:24.224 --> 01:47:25.685]  Something so pleasant about that place.
[01:47:37.573 --> 01:47:39.094]  I know too much.
[01:47:39.094 --> 01:47:43.377]  Oh, this audience knows too much, and they hate your gut.
[01:47:43.377 --> 01:47:46.579]  It doesn't matter much, man.
[01:47:46.579 --> 01:47:50.961]  You're winning, they're losing.
[01:47:50.961 --> 01:47:57.465]  They've had total control for decades, and now their power is draining away.
[01:47:57.465 --> 01:47:59.646]  Like somebody you're in a fight with, with hatchets.
[01:47:59.646 --> 01:48:02.188]  You hack their arm off, they keep fighting for a couple...
[01:48:03.067 --> 01:48:04.587]  Thirty seconds or so.
[01:48:04.587 --> 01:48:08.168]  Pretty soon they turn white and fall over.
[01:48:08.168 --> 01:48:11.189]  They bleed out.
[01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:14.550]  It's my only advice.
[01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:16.470]  Best part of the song right here.
[01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:18.371]  You think you're in control.
[01:48:33.027 --> 01:48:34.848]  Bless your soul.
[01:48:34.848 --> 01:48:38.589]  Satanists really think they're in control.
[01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:41.971]  There's only one thing in control, and that's God.
[01:48:41.971 --> 01:48:43.671]  Folks better figure that out real quick.
[01:48:43.671 --> 01:48:48.053]  We're on this planet, the whole universe around us.
[01:48:48.053 --> 01:48:50.374]  God's 100% real, it's been proven.
[01:48:50.374 --> 01:48:52.975]  You think you're gonna thumb your nose in front of that?
[01:48:52.975 --> 01:48:54.716]  You go ahead and throw your temper tantrum.
[01:48:54.716 --> 01:48:56.857]  Piss all over us that don't go along with you, Satan.
[01:48:56.857 --> 01:49:01.439]  At the end of the day, you know where you're going.
[01:49:01.439 --> 01:49:02.339]  That ought to remember.
[01:49:03.729 --> 01:49:05.010]  I want to be like them.
[01:49:27.366 --> 01:49:31.927]  Taking action without them pointing out that, hey, this isn't Netflix, this is entertainment.
[01:49:31.927 --> 01:49:34.047]  This is a real fight for the soul of America.
[01:49:34.047 --> 01:49:36.988]  We'll all be defeated.
[01:49:36.988 --> 01:49:40.649]  It really is the audience that is the key to the victory.
[01:49:40.649 --> 01:49:41.149]  Get into that.
[01:49:41.149 --> 01:49:49.530]  And then you were mentioning YouTube's deleting videos of Nazi history as part of hate speech crackdown.
[01:49:49.530 --> 01:49:52.971]  YouTube deletes historical archive channel for promoting hate.
[01:49:54.178 --> 01:49:58.699]  YouTube is deleting videos of Nazi history as part of hate speech crackdown.
[01:49:58.699 --> 01:50:02.420]  I remember I had a girlfriend over when I was in college.
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:08.962]  I had a couple bookshelves and on there was Rise and Fall of the Third Reich from Scherer.
[01:50:08.962 --> 01:50:11.022]  Want to pull a surprise.
[01:50:11.022 --> 01:50:12.223]  And she pulls it out.
[01:50:12.223 --> 01:50:15.244]  It's a black book with a big swastika on it.
[01:50:15.244 --> 01:50:18.684]  And she says, are you a Nazi?
[01:50:18.684 --> 01:50:19.605]  And I said, uh,
[01:50:21.007 --> 01:50:24.730]  Well, if I read a book on, you know, whatever, would I be that?
[01:50:24.730 --> 01:50:25.211]  I said, no.
[01:50:25.211 --> 01:50:28.214]  She said, why would you read that?
[01:50:28.214 --> 01:50:33.779]  But see, the general public thinks if you read a history book, you're a weird, like, they think you're showing off.
[01:50:33.779 --> 01:50:47.391]  It's kind of like idiocracy that's a fiction, but it's come true that my old friend put together, creator Hank Hill is, you know, as well, he created a lot of different things.
[01:50:49.304 --> 01:50:53.947]  In the movie, when the guy knows his rights, they go, oh, he talks like a fag!
[01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:58.610]  So that's what we've gotten to here, is where people think knowledge is evil.
[01:50:58.610 --> 01:51:01.912]  They think if you know things, you're trying to show off.
[01:51:01.912 --> 01:51:06.355]  And Mike Judge put that so well together, an idiocracy.
[01:51:06.355 --> 01:51:17.643]  So Paul, getting back to this, you know, people say it's a mistake of YouTube moderators to delete hundreds of channels that are Discovery Channel, History Channel, you know,
[01:51:19.761 --> 01:51:21.602]  Southern Poverty Law Center stuff.
[01:51:21.602 --> 01:51:22.703]  No.
[01:51:22.703 --> 01:51:26.786]  They want the power to delete whatever they want, whenever they want.
[01:51:26.786 --> 01:51:28.607]  As you said, they're coming after everybody.
[01:51:28.607 --> 01:51:31.989]  It's about corporate control, Paul.
[01:51:31.989 --> 01:51:32.930]  Precisely.
[01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:37.593]  But it's also about the fact they've broken their own website, as we've documented before with the search engine.
[01:51:38.172 --> 01:51:48.420]  And now these algorithms are saying... There are numerous teachers over the past three days who are complaining on Twitter about archival historical footage being deleted.
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:52.344]  Not only deleted the videos, their entire channels being removed.
[01:51:52.344 --> 01:52:01.211]  In one case it was a channel that uploaded their recent videos were like little girls in 1930s Germany playing on the street.
[01:52:01.211 --> 01:52:03.713]  None of the content was an endorsement of Nazism.
[01:52:04.326 --> 01:52:05.507]  The channel was deleted.
[01:52:05.507 --> 01:52:07.468]  It was restored after a backlash.
[01:52:07.468 --> 01:52:12.932]  But they're literally deleting evidence of the horrors of Nazism to own the Nazis.
[01:52:12.932 --> 01:52:15.995]  You know, it's galaxy brain logic there from YouTube.
[01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:20.158]  But again, it shows that nobody is immune from this, even if you're not political.
[01:52:20.158 --> 01:52:23.420]  Well, Paul, it shows how the SJWs just want power.
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:24.741]  People think, oh, this is a mistake.
[01:52:24.741 --> 01:52:25.281]  It's not.
[01:52:25.281 --> 01:52:28.444]  They want power over reality.
[01:52:28.444 --> 01:52:28.904]  Precisely.
[01:52:29.591 --> 01:52:31.311]  And obviously it was a one-two punch.
[01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:33.052]  The New York Times was the second punch.
[01:52:33.052 --> 01:52:46.675]  The first punch was the Vox Adpocalypse where you literally had a guy who calls himself at gay wonk complaining about people calling him gay on YouTube when he literally used the same slurs against himself.
[01:52:46.675 --> 01:52:51.717]  They can call us Nazis, far-right extremists, dangerous people all day long.
[01:52:51.717 --> 01:52:52.297]  They can throw any
[01:52:53.417 --> 01:53:05.843]  A vitriolic, horrible label at us, but you could use the same slurs that they use against themselves in a ribbing fashion like Crowder did, and then the mob outrage activates and the rest is collateral damage.
[01:53:05.843 --> 01:53:07.044]  The other thing that's going to happen is...
[01:53:08.050 --> 01:53:28.259]  Over the next few weeks and months, more of these people who have suddenly left the right wing, or who have suddenly tried to rebrand themselves, are going to be shopping their stories of how they were radicalised to all these mainstream media outlets, and then they will use that contrived moral outrage to try and de-platform even more people, so watch out for that.
[01:53:28.499 --> 01:53:39.103]  And these are the same left that want to bring in admitted ISIS fighters and killers to Sweden, the UK, the US, and repatriate them because they're good people.
[01:53:39.103 --> 01:53:50.508]  But if you watch the Paul Joseph Watson or a Milo Yiannopoulos or a Millie Weaver video, well, you can't be trusted.
[01:53:50.508 --> 01:53:51.028]  Precisely.
[01:53:51.028 --> 01:53:56.730]  And again, the New York Times article paints this dark, somber picture of this guy being radicalized.
[01:53:56.730 --> 01:53:58.051]  Radicalized to do what?
[01:53:58.726 --> 01:54:00.186]  He did absolutely nothing.
[01:54:00.186 --> 01:54:01.267]  He didn't shoot up a school.
[01:54:01.267 --> 01:54:06.228]  He didn't try to shoot a bunch of congressmen like James T. Hodgkinson, a leftist CNN viewer, did.
[01:54:06.228 --> 01:54:06.908]  He did nothing.
[01:54:06.908 --> 01:54:10.849]  He ended up watching liberal videos and became a leftist.
[01:54:10.849 --> 01:54:13.369]  So he wasn't radicalizing the alt-right.
[01:54:13.369 --> 01:54:15.870]  He said himself he was never alt-right.
[01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:21.911]  He became a leftist because of the algorithm that threw up these leftist videos and that's the course he took.
[01:54:21.911 --> 01:54:23.571]  So it's a complete bunk article, Alex.
[01:54:23.571 --> 01:54:27.712]  I'm going to be doing a video about it as soon as I get off air to explain this to everyone.
[01:54:31.963 --> 01:54:44.449]  Paul, I don't want to declare victory prematurely because we're in the fight of our lives, but intellectually on the street, anytime you try to bully people or take info from them, if there's any symbols of a free society left, you end up failing.
[01:54:44.449 --> 01:54:48.791]  And I'm betting on Europe, I'm betting on America, and I see all the signs of that.
[01:54:48.791 --> 01:54:50.132]  I don't see all this working.
[01:54:50.132 --> 01:54:59.397]  I don't see this ongoing censorship working because it's almost like Trump's letting them do it for the blowback.
[01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:04.408]  Because he knows they're just going to push, push, push until it's so bonkers.
[01:55:04.408 --> 01:55:06.028]  So maybe Trump's wiser than we are.
[01:55:06.028 --> 01:55:08.910]  But I just want to know, where's it going next?
[01:55:08.910 --> 01:55:15.653]  Because I was in a restaurant with Norm Pattis, famous constitutional lawyer, murder trial lawyer.
[01:55:15.653 --> 01:55:17.574]  He's got the big Connecticut murder case trial.
[01:55:17.574 --> 01:55:19.174]  He's all over the news.
[01:55:19.174 --> 01:55:21.415]  I'm sitting there Saturday night.
[01:55:21.415 --> 01:55:22.476]  He wants to get Mexican food.
[01:55:23.829 --> 01:55:27.470]  And I sign a few autographs, take a few pictures of this Mexican restaurant, and I'm leaving.
[01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:31.491]  And this guy goes, F you, Alex Jones, and I don't turn my back.
[01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:34.011]  All of a sudden, and F your family.
[01:55:34.011 --> 01:55:40.012]  Yeah, the footage they're showing is of me at Lucy's Chicken when something similar happened, but they did it three times threatening me before I got in their face.
[01:55:40.012 --> 01:55:45.073]  And when I got in the guy's face, they all went, shame on you harassing us!
[01:55:45.073 --> 01:55:45.713]  Shame on you!
[01:55:45.713 --> 01:55:48.134]  Are you proud of yourself harassing us?
[01:55:48.134 --> 01:55:48.754]  Are you proud?
[01:55:49.645 --> 01:55:52.074]  And it was just like, they're all like zombies.
[01:55:52.074 --> 01:55:53.721]  They say the same thing.
[01:55:53.721 --> 01:55:55.306]  They say FUF your family.
[01:55:56.411 --> 01:55:58.292]  You say, screw you, man, whatever.
[01:55:58.292 --> 01:56:01.173]  They go, oh my God, we're being harassed, help us!
[01:56:01.173 --> 01:56:05.215]  I mean, they're literally like sociopathic demons.
[01:56:05.215 --> 01:56:07.796]  And what's weird is they're all the same.
[01:56:07.796 --> 01:56:10.757]  They start the fight, you just say, hey, F you back.
[01:56:10.757 --> 01:56:12.858]  They go, oh my God, Alex Jones is attacking me!
[01:56:12.858 --> 01:56:13.999]  I go, shame on you!
[01:56:13.999 --> 01:56:15.299]  Are you proud of yourself?
[01:56:15.299 --> 01:56:17.400]  It's like they've killed logic.
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:21.222]  Like, they start the attack, and then they get mad when you stand up, Paul.
[01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:25.914]  Exactly, because it's a cult of victimhood.
[01:56:25.914 --> 01:56:32.322]  And that behavior that you see being exhibited comes as a result of leftist radicalization.
[01:56:32.322 --> 01:56:33.023]  That's the point.
[01:56:33.023 --> 01:56:39.072]  The very accusation they throw at us that we're radicalizing people to commit hate crimes and violence.
[01:56:39.767 --> 01:56:41.449]  That's what they're doing to the left.
[01:56:41.449 --> 01:56:45.453]  That's why you see people in MAGA hats getting physically attacked on a weekly basis.
[01:56:45.453 --> 01:56:50.779]  Taylon Bennett got attacked like five times on video and the cops come over and said, I don't want to see your footage.
[01:56:50.779 --> 01:56:51.600]  I'm going to arrest you.
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:52.240]  You need to leave.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:53.662]  They can attack you if they want.
[01:56:55.393 --> 01:56:59.197]  Precisely, and the data shows this, that the left-wing is being radicalized.
[01:56:59.197 --> 01:57:03.100]  They're becoming more and more extreme, both in words and deeds.
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:05.802]  And that is the real radicalization problem.
[01:57:05.802 --> 01:57:09.166]  It's not my edgy videos about fat feminists on YouTube.
[01:57:09.166 --> 01:57:11.107]  That's patently ridiculous.
[01:57:11.107 --> 01:57:21.617]  This is all a con to deplatform people because the left-wing media is going out of business and they want to eliminate their competition, so they're in cahoots with Silicon Valley to do exactly that.
[01:57:21.817 --> 01:57:24.659]  It's a total abuse of power by Silicon Valley.
[01:57:24.659 --> 01:57:26.280]  It's a shameful cartel.
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:30.704]  People should go to summit.news, the site you watch.
[01:57:30.704 --> 01:57:35.187]  You should sign up for the free email to make sure they can't stop you from getting Paul Watts' material.
[01:57:35.187 --> 01:57:36.888]  Spread it however you see fit.
[01:57:36.888 --> 01:57:40.011]  And folks should go to the site and spread those links as well.
[01:57:40.011 --> 01:57:41.372]  Paul, you're kicking ass.
[01:57:41.372 --> 01:57:42.673]  We appreciate you.
[01:57:42.673 --> 01:57:43.493]  Glad to know you're in the fight.
[01:57:43.493 --> 01:57:44.694]  Thank you.
[01:57:44.694 --> 01:57:45.375]  Thanks Alex.
[01:57:45.375 --> 01:57:45.675]  Thank you.
[01:57:48.481 --> 01:57:54.589]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[01:57:54.589 --> 01:58:02.099]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:58:02.099 --> 01:58:03.421]  Are you coming back?
[01:58:03.421 --> 01:58:04.562]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:05.143 --> 01:58:06.524]  We're at NewsWars.com.
[01:58:06.524 --> 01:58:08.765]  Paul Watts has launched his own Summit.News.
[01:58:08.765 --> 01:58:10.746]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[01:58:10.746 --> 01:58:15.529]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[01:58:15.529 --> 01:58:17.791]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:58:17.791 --> 01:58:21.053]  InfoWars.com, man!
[01:58:21.053 --> 01:58:21.413]  Woo!
[01:58:24.131 --> 01:58:27.192]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[01:58:27.192 --> 01:58:28.732]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[01:58:28.732 --> 01:58:31.773]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:58:31.773 --> 01:58:33.673]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[01:58:33.673 --> 01:58:37.174]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[01:58:37.174 --> 01:58:39.895]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[01:58:39.895 --> 01:58:41.995]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:58:41.995 --> 01:58:43.255]  That's where they find it.
[01:58:43.255 --> 01:58:45.156]  You know, there's things called websites.
[01:58:45.156 --> 01:58:45.576]  Just go there.
[01:58:48.368 --> 01:58:51.972]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:58:51.972 --> 01:58:53.734]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:58:53.734 --> 01:59:05.806]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:59:05.806 --> 01:59:10.812]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[01:59:11.572 --> 01:59:20.936]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:59:20.936 --> 01:59:26.019]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:59:26.019 --> 01:59:28.640]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:30.361]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:59:30.361 --> 01:59:39.745]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:59:40.345 --> 01:59:42.989]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:59:42.989 --> 01:59:51.904]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:59:51.904 --> 01:59:54.548]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:07.668 --> 02:00:10.310]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:15.313]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:15.313 --> 02:00:20.797]  Yellow storm on the loose, sirens in my head.
[02:00:20.797 --> 02:00:25.380]  Wrapped up in silence, our circuits are dead.
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:29.123]  Can I decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy?
[02:00:39.122 --> 02:00:41.503]  Alright, here's what's going on.
[02:00:41.503 --> 02:01:05.590]  I am so overwhelmed with huge breaking news and I'm going to talk to my reporters that are in San Antonio and at the border with reports that thousands of Africans out of the Congo are coming in and the Border Patrol believes that Ebola will end up coming here from the mathematics and the algorithms which just means the statistics they're looking at.
[02:01:05.590 --> 02:01:07.871]  So we've got an Alicia Powell report here
[02:01:09.710 --> 02:01:14.332]  Current ex-Trump supporters protest President's illegal immigration policy.
[02:01:14.332 --> 02:01:16.433]  The border's collapsing.
[02:01:16.433 --> 02:01:23.475]  I saw the Mexican main envoy bitching, saying, well, we can't take all these illegals pouring in from the world.
[02:01:23.475 --> 02:01:24.776]  America needs to take them.
[02:01:24.776 --> 02:01:26.056]  You shouldn't take them.
[02:01:26.056 --> 02:01:26.917]  We shouldn't take them.
[02:01:26.917 --> 02:01:29.478]  If they don't know they're going to make it in, they won't come here.
[02:01:29.478 --> 02:01:30.918]  Good Lord!
[02:01:30.918 --> 02:01:32.098]  We want to work with Mexico.
[02:01:32.098 --> 02:01:33.079]  We're not against Mexico.
[02:01:35.459 --> 02:01:37.563]  You've got armed people coming across every day?
[02:01:37.563 --> 02:01:40.707]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:01:40.707 --> 02:01:44.052]  This is totally insane.
[02:01:44.052 --> 02:01:45.735]  Here's that report from Alicia Powell.
[02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:48.501]  Not with President Trump.
[02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:49.481]  Why?
[02:01:49.481 --> 02:01:53.623]  I supported the President Trump that said he was going to enforce current immigration laws.
[02:01:53.623 --> 02:01:56.025]  I support the President that said he would deport illegal aliens.
[02:01:56.025 --> 02:02:06.470]  I've been fighting to stop illegal immigration and amnesty for 15 years as the President of ALIPAC, which stands for Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee.
[02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:14.894]  Six of our angel families begged Trump in the Oval Office to not sign the secretive budget deal of February 15th because it contained an amnesty for illegal immigrants in it.
[02:02:16.735 --> 02:02:32.468]  People are upset with the way President Trump's handling the immigration crisis, and it's apparently a manufactured crisis according to Democrats, but isn't he doing the best he can given the situation in your opinion?
[02:02:32.468 --> 02:02:33.709]  I don't think he is.
[02:02:33.709 --> 02:02:39.514]  I've been on the border along every border state, California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
[02:02:39.514 --> 02:02:41.456]  President Trump is not doing all he can.
[02:02:41.456 --> 02:02:44.138]  Understand, the crisis at the border is Donald Trump's fault.
[02:02:44.318 --> 02:02:45.898]  Yes, 100%.
[02:02:45.898 --> 02:02:52.000]  It was Donald Trump who chose not to end DACA on day one.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:52.901]  It was Donald Trump.
[02:02:52.901 --> 02:02:58.802]  Donald Trump didn't create DACA, and Donald Trump brought illegal immigration to the forefront of our national debate.
[02:02:58.802 --> 02:03:03.364]  We brought that issue forward when we shot Donald Trump up to the top of the Republican ticket.
[02:03:03.364 --> 02:03:07.065]  He could federalize calling the Federal Service all the National Guard.
[02:03:07.625 --> 02:03:10.266]  I'm here today to speak about my brother who was murdered by an illegal alien, a drunk driver.
[02:03:10.266 --> 02:03:12.548]  And I'm here too to speak out about how upset I am with Donald Trump.
[02:03:12.548 --> 02:03:14.929]  I've probably been one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters.
[02:03:31.664 --> 02:03:34.985]  But back in February, I thought he would shut the border down.
[02:03:34.985 --> 02:03:37.206]  He does not have the will to enforce the law.
[02:03:37.206 --> 02:03:38.346]  He's trying to build the wall.
[02:03:38.346 --> 02:03:41.307]  $1.5 billion he's trying to get for the wall for the past year.
[02:03:41.307 --> 02:03:42.628]  He declared a national emergency.
[02:03:42.628 --> 02:03:43.348]  No, no, no.
[02:03:43.348 --> 02:03:44.048]  Understand this.
[02:03:44.048 --> 02:03:45.048]  He has all excuses.
[02:03:45.048 --> 02:03:49.630]  The fault is not in the Congress, because the exact same laws that are here now were
[02:03:49.770 --> 02:03:53.274]  I just flew yesterday from El Paso, Texas and whenever I was in the airport there was lines of illegal asylum seekers
[02:04:06.610 --> 02:04:09.191]  That all they were flying with was paper documents.
[02:04:09.191 --> 02:04:11.472]  They didn't even have photo IDs.
[02:04:11.472 --> 02:04:14.693]  We know nothing about the people that are coming into this country.
[02:04:14.693 --> 02:04:21.495]  We're buying them flight tickets and they're flying all over our country and America is dumb and asleep right now.
[02:04:21.495 --> 02:04:27.717]  And whenever you're dumb and asleep, you're in a very dangerous place and you're letting, you're leaving yourself out there to get attacked.
[02:04:27.717 --> 02:04:28.917]  You can also deploy the U.S.
[02:04:28.917 --> 02:04:34.359]  military on the border like President Wilson did back in 1916 when Pancho Villa raided across the border.
[02:04:35.279 --> 02:04:39.621]  He needs to do what he can do, his full power as Commander in Chief under Article 2.
[02:04:39.621 --> 02:04:40.721]  He has not done that.
[02:04:40.721 --> 02:04:43.943]  He promised to end the catch and release program.
[02:04:43.943 --> 02:04:57.269]  And now we have more illegals crossing that border than we've ever had before.
[02:04:57.269 --> 02:05:03.292]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:05:04.639 --> 02:05:08.931]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[02:05:08.931 --> 02:05:12.641]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[02:05:18.288 --> 02:05:20.009]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:05:20.009 --> 02:05:21.229]  This is racketeering.
[02:05:21.229 --> 02:05:22.330]  This is cartels.
[02:05:22.330 --> 02:05:24.751]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:05:24.751 --> 02:05:26.632]  We need it now.
[02:05:26.632 --> 02:05:28.333]  You can take on Big Ten.
[02:05:28.333 --> 02:05:37.277]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[02:05:37.277 --> 02:05:45.320]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:46.161]  The way to fight back
[02:05:46.801 --> 02:05:51.648]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[02:05:51.648 --> 02:05:55.414]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[02:06:14.444 --> 02:06:19.953]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:19.953 --> 02:06:24.660]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:36.920 --> 02:06:40.884]  There's a story that's on Infowars.com that is amazing.
[02:06:40.884 --> 02:06:41.865]  It needs to go viral.
[02:06:41.865 --> 02:06:48.132]  California to offer illegals free health care by fining residents.
[02:06:48.132 --> 02:06:49.233]  Slavery's back, folks.
[02:06:49.233 --> 02:06:52.216]  You didn't know slavery was legalized again?
[02:06:52.216 --> 02:06:57.161]  Californians who don't qualify for free health care to pay for illegals who do qualify.
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:05.883]  California will now fund residents who don't buy health insurance to help pay for the health care of illegal aliens.
[02:07:05.883 --> 02:07:14.947]  California will become the first in the nation to offer state-funded health care coverage for illegal immigrants under the age of 26 at a cost of
[02:07:16.564 --> 02:07:16.925]  98 million.
[02:07:16.925 --> 02:07:18.787]  Of course, that'll be ten times that.
[02:07:18.787 --> 02:07:19.768]  And shore up money.
[02:07:19.768 --> 02:07:23.071]  The state will fine people for not purchasing insurance.
[02:07:23.071 --> 02:07:31.580]  So, you gotta get fined for not insurance to give it free to the illegals who are here with pre-existing conditions, ready to have it done, like having that baby.
[02:07:33.103 --> 02:07:44.791]  The fines were initially implemented as part of the Federal Affordable Care Act, a law known as Obamacare, but Republicans on the federal level acted in 2007 to roll them back, reported the Sacramento Bee.
[02:07:44.791 --> 02:07:55.278]  Newsom and legislative leaders are re-imposing the penalty as the state level will sure up the state's health care insurance markets and keep premiums from rising dramatically.
[02:07:55.278 --> 02:07:58.581]  Yeah, sure they will.
[02:07:58.581 --> 02:08:00.282]  Wow, that's on NewsWars.com.
[02:08:02.910 --> 02:08:04.270]  And Infowars.com.
[02:08:04.270 --> 02:08:05.831]  Talk about slavery, baby.
[02:08:05.831 --> 02:08:08.852]  It's back and it's cool and it's trendy.
[02:08:08.852 --> 02:08:12.693]  I was watching CNN and Fox News this morning.
[02:08:12.693 --> 02:08:16.974]  I was on the elliptical and it was like both reports were the same.
[02:08:16.974 --> 02:08:23.796]  It was like Asians are suing because they're not allowed to go to college even though they have the top grades.
[02:08:23.796 --> 02:08:30.758]  Because the left's gonna give it to quote minorities because of racism and Uncle Tom.
[02:08:31.792 --> 02:08:37.773]  So Asians that study and get the grade, they're the KKK now, so they can't get into college.
[02:08:37.773 --> 02:08:39.794]  It's just, it's total discrimination.
[02:08:39.794 --> 02:08:43.855]  And the Democrats then handed out as little prizes to whoever votes for them.
[02:08:43.855 --> 02:08:52.216]  It's so sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:52.216 --> 02:08:54.557]  President Trump, Google, Facebook, Amazon.
[02:08:56.070 --> 02:08:59.891]  Let's play a few minutes of him on CNBC, then we have Senator Josh Hawley also commenting on it.
[02:08:59.891 --> 02:09:00.111]  Here it is.
[02:09:15.650 --> 02:09:24.353]  We're the envy of the world, as you know, in terms of innovation and technology.
[02:09:24.353 --> 02:09:28.394]  I guess the worry is we certainly don't want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.
[02:09:28.394 --> 02:09:32.876]  Do you think Facebook and Google and Amazon, are these companies too big now?
[02:09:32.876 --> 02:09:35.836]  Do you think the antitrust scrutiny is warranted?
[02:09:35.836 --> 02:09:37.417]  Do you think they should be broken up?
[02:09:38.228 --> 02:09:40.430]  Well, I can tell you they discriminate against me.
[02:09:40.430 --> 02:09:42.032]  You know, people talk about collusion.
[02:09:42.032 --> 02:09:48.998]  The real collusion is between the Democrats and these companies, because they were so against me during my election run.
[02:09:48.998 --> 02:09:51.360]  Everybody said, if you don't have them, you can't win.
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:52.982]  Well, I won, you know, and I'll win again.
[02:09:53.983 --> 02:09:57.346]  Because we're doing well and we're not the fools anymore.
[02:09:57.346 --> 02:10:01.111]  We're not the foolish country that does so badly.
[02:10:01.111 --> 02:10:02.592]  You look at India.
[02:10:02.592 --> 02:10:04.735]  Very good friend of mine, Prime Minister Modi.
[02:10:04.735 --> 02:10:06.016]  You take a look at what they've done.
[02:10:06.016 --> 02:10:06.797]  100% tax on a motorcycle.
[02:10:08.919 --> 02:10:10.140]  We charged them nothing.
[02:10:10.140 --> 02:10:13.102]  So when Harley sends over there, they have a 100% tax.
[02:10:13.102 --> 02:10:18.706]  When they said that they make a tremendous number of motorcycles, when they sent them in no tax, I called him.
[02:10:18.706 --> 02:10:20.427]  I said it's unacceptable.
[02:10:20.427 --> 02:10:23.109]  He reduced it by 50% with one phone call.
[02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:26.991]  I said it's still unacceptable because it's 50% versus nothing.
[02:10:26.991 --> 02:10:29.553]  It's still unacceptable and they're working on it.
[02:10:29.553 --> 02:10:32.675]  But if I didn't, if we didn't have the power of what we have,
[02:10:33.496 --> 02:10:37.880]  And if we weren't the bank, well if we weren't the bank we wouldn't be talking about it because nobody would care.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:40.423]  But we're the bank that everybody wants to rob.
[02:10:40.423 --> 02:10:42.646]  And that's what they've been doing for a long period of time.
[02:10:42.646 --> 02:10:47.852]  800 billion dollars we have in trade deficits with other countries.
[02:10:47.852 --> 02:10:49.413]  So you tell me who made those deals.
[02:10:50.253 --> 02:10:57.375]  We also had a big, I know you'd like a strong defense, and it'd be nice to get prices down for those things.
[02:10:57.375 --> 02:11:01.116]  Do you think the United Technologies Raytheon merger accomplishes that?
[02:11:01.116 --> 02:11:04.817]  Is that something that makes sense and is good for the country?
[02:11:04.817 --> 02:11:14.040]  I'm a budget cutter, and I have cut the budget, but on defense I don't want to do any cutting because President Obama and President Bush, you know, he was fighting the wars in the Middle East.
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:19.341]  I was left a very depleted military, and I feel just the opposite.
[02:11:19.341 --> 02:11:22.262]  I'm very, very much of a cost-cutter.
[02:11:22.262 --> 02:11:25.943]  I want to have a great budget, but before a budget, I have to have a great military.
[02:11:25.943 --> 02:11:30.584]  So, as long as I'm here, we're going to have a great military, and they're not going to have to worry.
[02:11:30.584 --> 02:11:31.384]  We've rebuilt.
[02:11:31.384 --> 02:11:33.165]  We've ordered many F-35s.
[02:11:33.165 --> 02:11:38.586]  We've ordered ships and planes and missiles, and we're ordering the best stuff in the world.
[02:11:39.566 --> 02:11:41.387]  I'm a salesman for the country.
[02:11:41.387 --> 02:11:44.629]  I'm getting other countries to buy tremendous amounts of our military.
[02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:50.934]  You know, you could ask any of the folks that run the military companies, the different companies, what they're doing because of me.
[02:11:50.934 --> 02:11:52.435]  I get nothing.
[02:11:52.435 --> 02:11:55.637]  I'm sitting there in the Oval Office saying, you gotta buy our helicopters.
[02:11:55.637 --> 02:11:57.458]  If you don't, we're not gonna be happy with you.
[02:11:57.458 --> 02:12:01.240]  And they end up going out and buying our helicopters and our F-35s.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:05.263]  Look at how many F-35s Japan and other companies are buying.
[02:12:05.983 --> 02:12:09.425]  So, you know, it's good as long as I'm there.
[02:12:09.425 --> 02:12:17.210]  I'm a little concerned about United Technology and Raytheon because one of the things that I bring up all the time, we used to have many plane companies.
[02:12:17.210 --> 02:12:18.111]  We used to have many, many.
[02:12:18.111 --> 02:12:19.612]  They've all merged.
[02:12:19.612 --> 02:12:20.953]  Now we have very few.
[02:12:20.953 --> 02:12:24.275]  We have, you know, the two main ones, as you know.
[02:12:24.275 --> 02:12:29.698]  And you have Lockheed and you have Boeing and you have a little bit, some others, but a little bit.
[02:12:29.698 --> 02:12:30.859]  They've all merged in.
[02:12:30.859 --> 02:12:34.822]  So it's hard to negotiate when you have two companies and sometimes you get one bid.
[02:12:35.482 --> 02:12:40.667]  When we had 10 and 12 companies, that may not be sustainable because they all go bust.
[02:12:40.667 --> 02:12:43.269]  And so that's the purpose of what they did.
[02:12:43.269 --> 02:12:47.733]  But nevertheless, I can tell you because I get involved in negotiation.
[02:12:47.733 --> 02:12:50.095]  I got the plane costs down a lot.
[02:12:50.095 --> 02:12:57.101]  So when I hear United Technologies, which is a great company, I know it well because I bought many an Otis elevator over my lifetime.
[02:12:57.661 --> 02:13:12.427]  It's a great company, but when I hear United, and I bought a lot of Carrier, too, by the way, when I hear United and I hear Raytheon, which is another incredible company, the missile systems they make are incredible, when I hear they're merging, does that take away more competition?
[02:13:12.427 --> 02:13:16.669]  It becomes one big, fat, beautiful company.
[02:13:16.669 --> 02:13:20.931]  But I have to negotiate, meaning the United States has to buy things.
[02:13:20.931 --> 02:13:23.952]  And does that make it less competitive?
[02:13:24.617 --> 02:13:26.419]  Because it's already very less.
[02:13:26.419 --> 02:13:28.220]  It's already non-competitive.
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:30.382]  You look at the budgets of other major countries.
[02:13:30.382 --> 02:13:31.703]  Take a look at Russia.
[02:13:31.703 --> 02:13:34.986]  They spend $68 billion a year on military.
[02:13:34.986 --> 02:13:36.147]  Take a look at China.
[02:13:36.147 --> 02:13:38.689]  They're $200-250 billion a year.
[02:13:38.689 --> 02:13:40.651]  Well, we're many times that.
[02:13:40.651 --> 02:13:45.114]  And part of it is that we spend so much money, and part of it is we have no competition.
[02:13:45.114 --> 02:13:45.815]  We really don't.
[02:13:45.815 --> 02:13:46.756]  We don't have competition.
[02:13:46.756 --> 02:13:51.059]  Mr. President, the treatment of you set aside with Google or Facebook,
[02:13:52.060 --> 02:14:00.929]  Just in terms of market size and market dominance, do you think that there is a monopoly antitrust problem with those big companies?
[02:14:00.929 --> 02:14:04.673]  Setting your own personal feelings aside with them that needs to be addressed.
[02:14:04.673 --> 02:14:10.819]  Maybe there needs to be an update on competition, competitive laws or monopoly laws.
[02:14:10.819 --> 02:14:11.440]  What do you think?
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:14.563]  Well, there's something going on, Joe, and I will tell you this.
[02:14:14.563 --> 02:14:26.938]  The European Union, which is a fantastic group of negotiators, they actually, a very, very prominent person who you know well, who's in your show a lot, said the person at the European Union
[02:14:27.498 --> 02:14:32.359]  That is in charge of taxation, hates the United States more than any person anywhere in the world.
[02:14:32.359 --> 02:14:34.180]  And I really believe that's true.
[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:44.602]  Every week you see them going after Facebook and Apple and all of these companies that are, you know, they're great companies, but there's something going on.
[02:14:44.602 --> 02:14:47.863]  But I will say the European Union is suing them all the time.
[02:14:47.863 --> 02:14:49.823]  We're going to maybe look at it differently.
[02:14:49.823 --> 02:14:51.564]  We have a great Attorney General.
[02:14:51.564 --> 02:14:52.604]  We're going to look at it differently.
[02:14:53.004 --> 02:15:03.776]  But when they give European Union $7 billion and $5 billion and $2 billion and, you know, Apple gets sued for $10 billion and, you know, that's right now what's going on, but they'll end up settling.
[02:15:03.776 --> 02:15:04.637]  They get all this money.
[02:15:05.524 --> 02:15:06.625]  Well, we should be doing it.
[02:15:06.625 --> 02:15:07.385]  They're our companies.
[02:15:07.385 --> 02:15:09.286]  So they're actually attacking our companies.
[02:15:09.286 --> 02:15:10.987]  But we should be doing what they're doing.
[02:15:10.987 --> 02:15:14.669]  They think there's a monopoly, but I'm not sure that they think that.
[02:15:14.669 --> 02:15:16.270]  They just figure this is easy money.
[02:15:16.270 --> 02:15:21.173]  We'll sue Apple for $7 billion, and we'll make a settlement, or we'll win the case.
[02:15:21.173 --> 02:15:26.816]  So I think it's a bad situation, but obviously there is something going on in terms of monopoly.
[02:15:26.816 --> 02:15:31.119]  Mr. Trump, Mr. President, you mentioned UTX and Raytheon.
[02:15:31.119 --> 02:15:32.299]  It's tougher to negotiate.
[02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:38.253]  We've got Senator Josh Hawley on fire getting into all this.
[02:15:38.253 --> 02:15:44.158]  We're going to lay it out that Mike Adams, who's got big breaking news on the censorship intensification, it's all coming up.

[02:16:56.439 --> 02:17:00.360]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:01.900]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:04.861]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.861 --> 02:17:10.422]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.422 --> 02:17:11.622]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.622 --> 02:17:14.543]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[02:19:59.301 --> 02:20:17.287]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:17.287 --> 02:20:22.408]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.075 --> 02:20:34.905]  CBP agents reported an MS-13 gang member used a toddler with chicken pox in an attempt to make a fraudulent migrant family claim.
[02:20:34.905 --> 02:20:38.909]  One America's Emily Finn explains.
[02:20:38.909 --> 02:20:45.937]  Border protection officials care for a child with chicken pox brought to the US-Mexico border as part of a fake migrant family.
[02:20:46.638 --> 02:20:53.921]  In a recent tweet, Customs and Border Protection posted a blurred out picture of the child in the arms of a Border Patrol agent.
[02:20:53.921 --> 02:21:01.643]  The agency says, quote, the male who the child was with is not related to the child and has ties to the MS-13 gang.
[02:21:01.643 --> 02:21:06.365]  Child smuggling in hopes of a quicker release for migrants seeking to enter the U.S.
[02:21:06.365 --> 02:21:08.966]  has been a rising problem for Border Patrol agents.
[02:21:09.466 --> 02:21:18.415]  In April, Homeland Security Investigation Special Agents say they found evidence of fraud in more than 25% of family unit claims.
[02:21:18.415 --> 02:21:27.245]  Adults are attempting to cross the border with a child who is not related to them because asylum seekers traveling with children can only be detained for short periods of time.
[02:21:27.705 --> 02:21:33.868]  And the inability to keep families together while they complete expeditious and fair immigration proceedings.
[02:21:33.868 --> 02:21:38.490]  Instead, crossing with a child is a near guarantee of a speedy release.
[02:21:38.490 --> 02:21:50.215]  The smugglers are choosing the timing and location for these crossings strategically in order to disrupt our border security efforts, create a diversion for smuggling of narcotics, and allow single adults seeking to evade capture to sneak in.
[02:21:50.535 --> 02:22:01.068]  In an effort to combat the surge of migrants at the southern border, the CBP is now testing out a rapid DNA program to speed up the process to uncover fraudulent families.
[02:22:01.068 --> 02:22:03.311]  But migrants are attempting to enter the U.S.
[02:22:03.311 --> 02:22:07.036]  illegally at higher rates than border protection agents can keep up with.
[02:22:07.216 --> 02:22:14.263]  I had a gentleman in Guatemala last week tell me that everybody knows that bringing a child is a passport for migration right now.
[02:22:14.263 --> 02:22:18.267]  And so we have to take additional measures at the border and we've done that.
[02:22:18.267 --> 02:22:23.893]  We have HSI teams now, about 500 special agents working this issue nationally, 140 on the border.
[02:22:25.208 --> 02:22:36.742]  Even with record-breaking apprehensions at the southern border, migrants continue to find loopholes in the system, like smuggling children as part of fake families to illegally sneak their way into the U.S.
[02:22:36.742 --> 02:22:38.685]  Emily Finn, One America News.
[02:22:39.873 --> 02:22:44.239]  You gotta love, too, if you're watching our TV feed of this, if you're a radio listener, you don't see it.
[02:22:44.239 --> 02:22:54.892]  They're waving their foreign flags, and they've been at these UN brainwashing camps, that even Jordan Klepper has a show on Comedy Central with the Clintons.
[02:22:54.892 --> 02:22:55.853]  They're involved in it.
[02:22:55.853 --> 02:22:56.614]  They're on the show.
[02:22:56.614 --> 02:22:58.357]  They reportedly are financing it.
[02:22:59.417 --> 02:23:06.442]  Where they take them in, in Texas and Georgia and everywhere, and brainwash them to hate America.
[02:23:06.442 --> 02:23:15.389]  So they get here, they're waving foreign flags, they're bitching about everything, and then they're bitching that more free stuff isn't being given to them.
[02:23:15.389 --> 02:23:18.332]  God help us.
[02:23:18.332 --> 02:23:24.336]  And now you've got the Congo in the second biggest, maybe the biggest Ebola outbreak in history.
[02:23:24.336 --> 02:23:25.317]  Thousands dying.
[02:23:28.410 --> 02:23:37.619]  We have thousands of Africans, 300, 200, 500, 200, 100, just pouring across into Texas.
[02:23:37.619 --> 02:23:48.429]  And again, we've got a bunch of reports that are going to be going up on Infowars.com, Newswars.com, talking to the folks, them admitting they're fleeing Ebola, the Border Patrol reports, all of it.
[02:23:49.514 --> 02:23:57.457]  We'll be up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and I'll tell you, this has been on one San Antonio TV station.
[02:23:57.457 --> 02:24:00.018]  I thought it had been on more.
[02:24:00.018 --> 02:24:09.562]  It's been on one San Antonio TV station, and we've played that clip, but nowhere else.
[02:24:09.562 --> 02:24:14.404]  They do not want you to know this, even though for two days,
[02:24:15.796 --> 02:24:19.239]  Drudge always changes a link within a day, except when they don't cover it.
[02:24:19.239 --> 02:24:32.330]  DrudgeReport.com, right in the middle for two days, has had border battle hundreds from Ebola-ridden Congo dumped in Texas.
[02:24:32.330 --> 02:24:34.092]  And we've got the video, it's all right there.
[02:24:37.469 --> 02:24:41.433]  Meanwhile, liberals mock Trump's deal, saying there is no crisis.
[02:24:41.433 --> 02:24:46.338]  In fact, let's cue up Bernie Sanders first, then I'll play Senator Josh Hawley.
[02:24:48.542 --> 02:25:02.633]  Even CNN, who had the talking point from a year ago, the middle of 2018, to now, that, oh, there's no border crisis, there's no caravans, that's a made-up thing by Alex Jones and Matt Grudge and Donald Trump.
[02:25:02.633 --> 02:25:05.816]  I'm 15,000 here, 10,000 here, 5,000 there.
[02:25:05.816 --> 02:25:08.518]  He's on CNN.
[02:25:08.518 --> 02:25:11.981]  I'm messing up my voice a bit, it's more of a southern voice.
[02:25:11.981 --> 02:25:15.724]  White people do not know what it's like to be poor.
[02:25:15.724 --> 02:25:17.926]  Now I'm back in my Sanders character.
[02:25:19.005 --> 02:25:23.108]  He's like, there is no crisis, no problem at all.
[02:25:23.108 --> 02:25:28.812]  Lots of poor people indoctrinated into communism will work quite well.
[02:25:28.812 --> 02:25:31.533]  But see, Dana Bash knows no one's buying the lie.
[02:25:31.533 --> 02:25:32.214]  That lie didn't work.
[02:25:32.214 --> 02:25:34.615]  She's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Bernie.
[02:25:34.615 --> 02:25:38.018]  That's a six-month-old or three-month-old propaganda.
[02:25:38.018 --> 02:25:39.659]  That doesn't work anymore.
[02:25:39.659 --> 02:25:44.182]  And Sanders is like, don't try that with me, young lady.
[02:25:45.370 --> 02:25:49.972]  The world will end in 12 years unless you give me full control.
[02:25:49.972 --> 02:25:58.715]  Now I'm going to play a short piece of the clip, but the full video, again, is up at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and I'll say it again.
[02:25:58.715 --> 02:26:01.896]  When you get excited and take action, we kick ass and we win together.
[02:26:01.896 --> 02:26:04.257]  When you don't, we're destroyed.
[02:26:04.257 --> 02:26:13.120]  So the story needs to be shared on your email, needs to be shared on your text message, and your Facebook, and your Twitter, and your Google.
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:14.461]  They may punish you, so what?
[02:26:16.261 --> 02:26:19.363]  Share it from newsworth.com or summit.news.
[02:26:19.363 --> 02:26:21.365]  Not as censored as much.
[02:26:21.365 --> 02:26:23.687]  Libtards do not recognize it.
[02:26:23.687 --> 02:26:25.328]  Not very smart.
[02:26:25.328 --> 02:26:34.755]  They're banning MIT and PBS documentaries against Hitler, saying they are pro-Hitler.
[02:26:34.755 --> 02:26:37.177]  That is the average leftist.
[02:26:37.177 --> 02:26:40.960]  So remember, a URL change they do not get.
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:43.582]  Here is Bernie Sanders!
[02:26:44.824 --> 02:26:46.664]  Talk broadly about immigration.
[02:26:46.664 --> 02:26:53.846]  You tweeted this week that President Trump's tariffs were a, quote, fake border crisis, in quotation marks.
[02:26:53.846 --> 02:27:01.008]  But immigration officials have arrested or encountered more than 144,000 migrants at the southern border in May.
[02:27:01.008 --> 02:27:04.089]  The highest monthly total in 13 years.
[02:27:04.089 --> 02:27:06.789]  Border facilities are dangerously overcrowded.
[02:27:06.789 --> 02:27:11.171]  Migrants are actually standing on toilets to get space to breathe.
[02:27:11.171 --> 02:27:12.671]  How is that not a crisis?
[02:27:14.690 --> 02:27:26.356]  What we need to do, I mean, what Trump has been doing, and I think what the meaning of that tweet is about, is that Trump has been demonizing undocumented people in this country, and that's part of his strategy.
[02:27:26.356 --> 02:27:27.737]  Hey, pause again!
[02:27:27.737 --> 02:27:30.879]  They have opened the border!
[02:27:30.879 --> 02:27:33.701]  They have told everyone, come!
[02:27:33.701 --> 02:27:36.722]  And even A-groups say, we overwhelmed!
[02:27:36.722 --> 02:27:37.983]  That's Trump's fault!
[02:27:37.983 --> 02:27:40.784]  That's white people's fault!
[02:27:40.784 --> 02:27:43.346]  Mexico says, we can't take these hundreds of thousands a month!
[02:27:44.656 --> 02:27:46.058]  You got it!
[02:27:46.058 --> 02:27:47.000]  Yes!
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.783]  Mexico not take!
[02:27:48.783 --> 02:27:51.387]  Evil white America take!
[02:27:51.387 --> 02:27:54.353]  Let's continue with Bernie Tenders!
[02:27:55.683 --> 02:28:07.071]  What we need to do, I mean, what Trump has been doing, and I think what the meaning of that tweet is about, is that Trump has been demonizing undocumented people in this country.
[02:28:07.071 --> 02:28:14.956]  Oh, Trump has been demonizing undocumented... I swindle colleges and live in million-dollar houses.
[02:28:14.956 --> 02:28:15.757]  I drive $115,000 cars.
[02:28:15.757 --> 02:28:18.238]  But you need to pay for them.
[02:28:18.238 --> 02:28:19.739]  And you will?
[02:28:19.739 --> 02:28:20.600]  I am superior.
[02:28:26.098 --> 02:28:28.919]  Now bow to me!
[02:28:28.919 --> 02:28:33.741]  Bow to Bernie Tanders!
[02:28:33.741 --> 02:28:42.504]  Who obviously is the leader of the Democratic Party, but they've already stolen it with the fake polls for Joe Biden, who's like, talks like he's had a bottle of Jack Daniels in the last hour.
[02:28:42.504 --> 02:28:49.687]  So you got that drunken, brain-damaged waffle head, and you got Bernie Tanders, some leftover from the Soviet Union.
[02:28:49.687 --> 02:28:50.587]  Ha!
[02:28:50.587 --> 02:28:51.768]  What a group of jokes!
[02:28:55.262 --> 02:28:59.825]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.825 --> 02:29:01.927]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.927 --> 02:29:03.648]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.648 --> 02:29:10.212]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.212 --> 02:29:15.296]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.296 --> 02:29:19.979]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.419 --> 02:29:23.520]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[02:31:52.535 --> 02:31:53.056]  Okay, it's true.
[02:31:53.056 --> 02:31:54.918]  I stayed up late last night, so I had to
[02:32:54.608 --> 02:32:59.374]  And hit the visuals!
[02:32:59.374 --> 02:33:01.977]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:54.514 --> 02:34:14.588]  I got a little bit late back in studio because I'm working with three different teams of reporters in San Antonio and on the border with the thousands of Conganese, that's folks from the Congo, Central Africa, where the second biggest, they're saying it's about to be the biggest Ebola outbreak in history took place.
[02:34:14.588 --> 02:34:17.510]  And a lot of them admit they're trying to flee Ebola.
[02:34:17.510 --> 02:34:20.172]  So smugglers bring them into Central America.
[02:34:20.172 --> 02:34:20.933]  They don't stay there.
[02:34:20.933 --> 02:34:22.294]  They come here because they can get free welfare.
[02:34:24.045 --> 02:34:30.070]  And there's now reportedly over a thousand in San Antonio, and thousands more coming across.
[02:34:30.070 --> 02:34:40.518]  Because I've made more phone calls, I've talked to more sources, and the Border Patrol is saying, we're not even allowed to keep them, we're not even allowed to test them, we are overwhelmed.
[02:34:40.518 --> 02:34:46.483]  I mean, we're talking for every border agent, maybe a hundred to two hundred people come across a day.
[02:34:48.348 --> 02:34:52.492]  And we have due process, so you gotta get them, you gotta process them, you gotta have a place to put them.
[02:34:52.492 --> 02:34:58.078]  They're like, well those border patrol, you know, Ann Coulter's like, damn Trump and the border patrol, you know, they're letting these people go.
[02:34:58.078 --> 02:35:06.206]  What the hell's, well it's like, it's like World War II, and you're France, and you know, five million Germans attack you.
[02:35:06.206 --> 02:35:08.008]  It's kind of a day late and a dollar short.
[02:35:09.815 --> 02:35:11.195]  Again, I'm not even defending Trump.
[02:35:11.195 --> 02:35:20.058]  Trump tried to get $12,600,000,000 to just build more emergency centers and get contractors and stabilize stuff for the next fiscal year.
[02:35:20.058 --> 02:35:26.400]  He got one point, what was it, $1.3 billion?
[02:35:26.400 --> 02:35:34.323]  And so now you've got Mexican drug kingpins and people with the guns in their waist or guns on their back marching folks right into California.
[02:35:34.323 --> 02:35:35.163]  I'm showing footage right now.
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:38.941]  And Mexico's like that.
[02:35:38.941 --> 02:35:40.702]  Mexico's had civilization collapse.
[02:35:40.702 --> 02:35:44.844]  They've had, well, we're about to be the same.
[02:35:44.844 --> 02:35:48.206]  And then it just comes down to men with guns.
[02:35:48.206 --> 02:35:54.849]  Because our own government wouldn't put men with guns on the border and wouldn't give them the authority.
[02:35:54.849 --> 02:35:55.029]  U.S.
[02:35:55.029 --> 02:36:01.392]  border town seeks African dialect speakers as hundreds of Africans cross from Mexico.
[02:36:01.392 --> 02:36:02.453]  That's today.
[02:36:02.453 --> 02:36:04.034]  That's hundreds more today.
[02:36:05.367 --> 02:36:09.388]  Exactly what Border Patrol told me this morning.
[02:36:09.388 --> 02:36:11.828]  They said, yeah, Mr. Jones, we're really freaked out.
[02:36:11.828 --> 02:36:14.449]  Do you know why Fox News won't cover this?
[02:36:14.449 --> 02:36:17.449]  Do you know why the President isn't talking about the Ebola threat?
[02:36:17.449 --> 02:36:25.630]  Because we'll be honest with you, you know, just like years ago, we just go down the line and nothing against you, but, you know, it'd be bigger if Fox did this.
[02:36:25.630 --> 02:36:27.551]  And I go, I understand.
[02:36:27.551 --> 02:36:31.751]  They go, but we know that you'll get it out and maybe Matt Drudge will get it out.
[02:36:31.751 --> 02:36:32.572]  That was this morning.
[02:36:32.572 --> 02:36:34.112]  They were talking about Drudge linking to it two days ago.
[02:36:35.362 --> 02:36:42.246]  I've got my reporters down there and they're getting all the footage and it'll be up soon.
[02:36:42.246 --> 02:36:45.028]  And it'll be posted in the article that Drudge is linked to.
[02:36:45.028 --> 02:36:48.090]  We'll have new articles out on it.
[02:36:48.090 --> 02:36:49.051]  God love my reporters.
[02:36:49.051 --> 02:36:49.831]  They're such good guys.
[02:36:49.831 --> 02:36:52.373]  They're like, well, these people speak French.
[02:36:52.373 --> 02:36:54.194]  We don't understand them.
[02:36:54.194 --> 02:36:55.875]  And I said, use a Google translator.
[02:36:55.875 --> 02:36:58.837]  Because I've been doing this during the breaks.
[02:36:59.844 --> 02:37:00.964]  But I'm not complaining.
[02:37:00.964 --> 02:37:03.865]  But I'm just saying, I'm doing a lot of multitasking.
[02:37:03.865 --> 02:37:06.226]  I'm like, get a Google translator and ask them in French.
[02:37:06.226 --> 02:37:10.126]  That's the second language in there.
[02:37:10.126 --> 02:37:11.507]  Why did you leave?
[02:37:11.507 --> 02:37:15.548]  What are your fears?
[02:37:15.548 --> 02:37:19.009]  And they tell him, Ebola.
[02:37:19.009 --> 02:37:22.529]  He might think that's newsworthy.
[02:37:22.529 --> 02:37:23.170]  Does it matter?
[02:37:23.170 --> 02:37:26.791]  It's in French.
[02:37:26.791 --> 02:37:28.411]  Africans fleeing the Congo.
[02:37:30.180 --> 02:37:35.042]  Africans fleeing Ebola arrive in Texas.
[02:37:35.042 --> 02:37:40.325]  We have it confirmed.
[02:37:40.325 --> 02:37:46.567]  And I'm not bitching, but imagine a normal news editor at a major paper would spend days just on this topic.
[02:37:46.567 --> 02:37:47.588]  I mean, this is so huge.
[02:37:47.588 --> 02:37:51.550]  This is like giant kahuna level insane.
[02:37:51.550 --> 02:37:53.030]  I live here.
[02:37:53.030 --> 02:37:54.151]  I have four children here.
[02:37:56.374 --> 02:37:59.975]  We're already seeing drug-resistant whooping cough in TV.
[02:37:59.975 --> 02:38:00.875]  It's everywhere.
[02:38:00.875 --> 02:38:08.717]  People are dying than I know.
[02:38:08.717 --> 02:38:12.237]  Much less, how am I going to pay for all the Africans coming here?
[02:38:12.237 --> 02:38:22.540]  Because you get a $500 plane ticket out of Africa to Central America, and in a week or two, you go to a refugee center and you're given $1,000 credit cards
[02:38:25.191 --> 02:38:27.473]  Debit cards that have no name on it.
[02:38:27.473 --> 02:38:29.815]  And then you're here and you're in like Flynn.
[02:38:29.815 --> 02:38:31.376]  It's over!
[02:38:31.376 --> 02:38:33.057]  It's over!
[02:38:33.057 --> 02:38:33.918]  Finale!
[02:38:33.918 --> 02:38:36.540]  Complete!
[02:38:36.540 --> 02:38:43.585]  I haven't even gotten to the reports.
[02:38:43.585 --> 02:38:47.048]  And we're all so comfortable and used to this.
[02:38:47.048 --> 02:38:52.652]  My own reporters are smart, sharp people are like, well, what's the story here?
[02:38:58.106 --> 02:39:01.935]  See, we've all become so conditioned to this.
[02:39:06.149 --> 02:39:12.973]  We've got the guest host taking over, but Mike, what would you call this learned helplessness where the system knows what it's doing?
[02:39:12.973 --> 02:39:21.257]  You're a smart psychologist type guy, you know, business owner, engineer, but you understand the real world's about not pop psychology, but real.
[02:39:21.257 --> 02:39:24.178]  We're being maneuvered into learned helplessness, aren't we?
[02:39:24.178 --> 02:39:28.601]  Or like a mass Stockholm syndrome because we have just sensational evil going on.
[02:39:29.441 --> 02:39:41.216]  And the Border Patrol, and I'm not bragging, I feel horrible, has to call me because no one else, one TV station is reporting on this, Mike, which means the kibosh is on it.
[02:39:41.216 --> 02:39:42.057]  Insane.
[02:39:42.057 --> 02:39:47.564]  Aside from the psychological context here, something very important to understand is that
[02:39:48.184 --> 02:40:01.267]  This invasion, this is a bioweapons invasion of America, and it's being combined with what you want me to come on and talk about, which is the censorship of vaccine truth information.
[02:40:01.267 --> 02:40:05.508]  And Gerald Salente is coming up, and we'll take one segment from him and get into detail on that.
[02:40:05.508 --> 02:40:06.668]  But exactly, it's all tied.
[02:40:06.668 --> 02:40:08.909]  They want to censor us ahead of this move.
[02:40:10.315 --> 02:40:13.736]  This outbreak is being engineered to happen.
[02:40:13.736 --> 02:40:15.656]  They want this outbreak to happen.
[02:40:15.656 --> 02:40:23.198]  And then they have to completely control the narrative so that no one can come online and question the safety of the Ebola vaccine.
[02:40:23.198 --> 02:40:23.778]  Oh, I totally agree.
[02:40:23.778 --> 02:40:28.039]  Like you said yesterday, the clampdown is ahead of the big event.
[02:40:28.039 --> 02:40:28.920]  Absolutely.
[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:34.841]  And remember that all the other vaccines that are out there, like measles vaccines, actually spread the measles in some cases.
[02:40:34.841 --> 02:40:36.942]  Chickenpox vaccines spread chickenpox.
[02:40:36.942 --> 02:40:38.762]  And they've already got an Ebola vaccine ready.
[02:40:39.815 --> 02:40:40.375]  Exactly.
[02:40:40.375 --> 02:40:43.797]  And so, as the outbreak of Ebola... So they're getting ready for a major Ebola scare.
[02:40:43.797 --> 02:40:45.519]  I think you're right.
[02:40:45.519 --> 02:40:55.385]  Well, it's just, it's one of many potential vectors of total panic and total demanded control over the population that we could see.
[02:40:55.385 --> 02:40:56.545]  That could be one of them.
[02:40:56.545 --> 02:40:57.826]  There are others.
[02:40:57.826 --> 02:41:01.929]  You know, there's cyber war attacks on the national power grid, for example.
[02:41:01.929 --> 02:41:03.770]  There's EMP weapons.
[02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:05.111]  There's financial collapse.
[02:41:05.111 --> 02:41:08.853]  There's so many things that could be engineered now, but they all have in common.
[02:41:09.514 --> 02:41:25.630]  The total demanded control over the narrative, the definition of what is a fact, and, of course, blaming conservatives and blaming Trump for everything bad that happens.
[02:41:25.630 --> 02:41:27.852]  You just crystallized it all, and that's it.
[02:41:27.852 --> 02:41:29.054]  Why would you collapse the border?
[02:41:30.236 --> 02:41:34.658]  Why would you bring in people from an Ebola-infested country and then not make it news?
[02:41:34.658 --> 02:41:39.501]  It shows it's part of a larger plan, and I agree with you that that's in the cards.
[02:41:39.501 --> 02:41:41.262]  This is an insane time, Mike.
[02:41:41.262 --> 02:41:43.063]  And Alex, go back a couple years.
[02:41:43.063 --> 02:41:57.751]  Remember the Zika virus fake fear-mongering from the media when they told us Zika was going to take over, and they said that children were going to be born throughout the southern United States with shrunken heads.
[02:41:58.351 --> 02:42:04.455]  Because of the Zika virus effect, and they used that for Obama to funnel billions of dollars into the vaccine industry.
[02:42:04.455 --> 02:42:05.516]  Remember that?
[02:42:05.516 --> 02:42:07.978]  And then that story vanished.
[02:42:07.978 --> 02:42:08.818]  It disappeared.
[02:42:08.818 --> 02:42:10.159]  There were no retractions.
[02:42:10.159 --> 02:42:12.681]  The entire thing was bogus.
[02:42:12.681 --> 02:42:14.482]  But they controlled the narrative.
[02:42:14.482 --> 02:42:19.946]  Now in this case, when there's a real threat like Ebola, then they pretend it doesn't exist.
[02:42:19.946 --> 02:42:24.009]  So, in the mainstream media, when they say it's real, it's fake.
[02:42:24.009 --> 02:42:25.990]  When they say it's fake, it's real.
[02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:27.371]  That's exactly what we're witnessing now.
[02:42:28.602 --> 02:42:47.174]  Oh, well there's absolutely no doubt that the Congo has massive Ebola outbreaks, thousands of dead, and then unvetted people are flying on airplanes, landing in Guatemala, getting on trains, coming up and then coming across the border, and one TV station has reported on it, and Rogers reported on it.
[02:42:47.174 --> 02:42:50.115]  Other than that, a total news blackout.
[02:42:50.115 --> 02:42:51.957]  We've got all our reporters on it.
[02:42:51.957 --> 02:42:53.858]  Huge news about to break.
[02:42:56.164 --> 02:43:03.467]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[02:43:03.467 --> 02:43:06.609]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[02:43:06.609 --> 02:43:10.891]  But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[02:43:10.891 --> 02:43:12.391]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:43:12.391 --> 02:43:18.874]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[02:43:18.874 --> 02:43:21.375]  So remember, you are the info war.
[02:43:21.375 --> 02:43:23.176]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[02:43:23.176 --> 02:43:24.757]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[02:43:25.137 --> 02:43:30.561]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com that are unprecedented.
[02:43:30.561 --> 02:43:38.288]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[02:43:38.288 --> 02:43:41.110]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:46.034]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.

[02:43:51.298 --> 02:43:51.759]  God bless you.
[02:43:55.846 --> 02:44:00.032]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:44:00.032 --> 02:44:10.425]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[02:44:10.425 --> 02:44:13.629]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[02:44:13.749 --> 02:44:14.029]  I'm good.
[02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:39.034]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[02:44:39.034 --> 02:44:47.639]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[02:44:47.639 --> 02:44:50.940]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[02:44:50.940 --> 02:44:54.342]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:44:56.880 --> 02:45:07.945]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[02:45:07.945 --> 02:45:16.829]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[02:45:16.829 --> 02:45:20.831]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[02:45:21.511 --> 02:45:27.980]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[02:45:27.980 --> 02:45:30.163]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
[02:45:30.163 --> 02:45:36.091]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to InfoWarsStore.com and get OxyPowder.
[02:45:36.091 --> 02:45:38.654]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.

[02:46:14.412 --> 02:46:15.172]  Sports broadcast.
[02:46:15.172 --> 02:46:15.892]  Spreads the word.
[02:46:15.892 --> 02:46:17.593]  Great conversation piece.
[02:46:17.593 --> 02:46:18.033]  It's 33% off.
[02:46:18.033 --> 02:46:20.233]  If we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[02:46:20.233 --> 02:46:23.054]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.

[02:46:25.614 --> 02:46:28.115]  That is the best GoQ10 PQQ system.

[02:46:29.595 --> 02:46:29.735]  50% off.
[02:46:30.915 --> 02:46:32.316]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[02:46:32.316 --> 02:46:33.717]  RainForce Plus, amazing.
[02:46:33.717 --> 02:46:38.040]  TurboForce, which is just tearing our energy clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:40.021]  Ultimate FemaleForce is incredible as well.
[02:46:40.021 --> 02:46:42.002]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[02:46:42.002 --> 02:46:44.804]  All of the Force products, it's got Force in the name.

[02:47:09.129 --> 02:47:11.770]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:47:11.770 --> 02:47:19.013]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:47:19.013 --> 02:47:25.035]  It's now admitted in 2019 that five years ago, Ebola did show up in Texas.
[02:47:26.458 --> 02:47:31.721]  Georgia, New York, and other areas of people were kept in secret wings.
[02:47:31.721 --> 02:47:35.303]  I was reporting at the time at Infowars.com.
[02:47:35.303 --> 02:47:40.006]  Mike Adams was spearheading it at the time at NaturalNews.com.
[02:47:40.006 --> 02:47:52.713]  He's been totally censored off everything just like we have because he owns a scientific lab, he has consumer reports, he spearheaded exposing glyphosate, which they now admit is causing massive cancer or losing hundreds of huge billion-dollar lawsuits.
[02:47:52.713 --> 02:47:53.494]  They're in panic mode.
[02:47:54.747 --> 02:47:59.710]  Look at this article out of the Houston Chronicle in January of this year, just six months ago.
[02:47:59.710 --> 02:48:06.733]  Texas scientists develop universal treatment for full-blown Ebola, and they've got vaccines, everything else.
[02:48:06.733 --> 02:48:22.041]  So why, with the captured federal government, Trump only controls part of it, be bringing in thousands of Africans to Texas alone, fleeing the Congo, with what they're now saying is the second or largest outbreak ever.
[02:48:23.306 --> 02:48:27.969]  And just all over San Antonio are just thousands of people wandering around.
[02:48:27.969 --> 02:48:28.910]  We've talked to the Border Patrol.
[02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:33.733]  They say, Alex, it's not 300, it's thousands, over a thousand the last few days.
[02:48:33.733 --> 02:48:38.816]  And I even found an article from South Texas I showed earlier saying that indeed that's happened.
[02:48:38.816 --> 02:48:44.660]  So what is the left going to do when they said there wasn't a border crisis and then Ebola shows up?
[02:48:44.660 --> 02:48:46.381]  I guess they'll cover it up like TB or
[02:48:47.285 --> 02:48:48.846]  A bubonic plague or any of this.
[02:48:48.846 --> 02:48:51.568]  Mike Adams, you're a big picture guy and a details guy.
[02:48:51.568 --> 02:48:58.332]  You've already laid a lot of this out, but gut level, just instinctive approximation and all your research, what do you think's going on?
[02:48:58.332 --> 02:49:00.293]  I think what you said earlier is right.
[02:49:00.293 --> 02:49:06.397]  I think they're betting Ebola's going to come in, just like the EU said, just like the UN said, just like TPP said.
[02:49:06.397 --> 02:49:14.342]  North American Union, I remember six, seven, eight years ago, they said, we'll use major disease outbreaks to unify hemispheres and to unify regions.
[02:49:16.095 --> 02:49:22.858]  Well, with a disease outbreak like Ebola, it provides cover for the release of an engineered bioweapon.
[02:49:22.858 --> 02:49:33.222]  So, bioweapons have a tactical advantage for those who are evil enough to deploy them, that you cannot trace the origin because they're a self-replicating weapon system.
[02:49:33.222 --> 02:49:43.747]  Chemical weapons do not self-replicate, even nuclear weapons do not self-replicate, and you can usually track where they came from by the isotopic ratios of the radioactive elements.
[02:49:44.447 --> 02:49:48.968]  But biological weapons are almost impossible to track their origins.
[02:49:48.968 --> 02:50:01.312]  So you're saying, this is pure genius, is that historically it's a decoy, just like HIV was, for a real bioweapon that the NGOs, the World Health Organization, the eugenicists are tracking.
[02:50:01.312 --> 02:50:07.434]  They let it in as the cover, then they've got something else they release that they've already been testing.
[02:50:07.434 --> 02:50:08.074]  Well, exactly.
[02:50:08.074 --> 02:50:13.236]  Remember, they've been conducting these tests and releasing these weaponized viruses in small villages in Africa.
[02:50:14.011 --> 02:50:17.193]  And they've also tested in fertility chemicals and vaccines.
[02:50:17.193 --> 02:50:23.696]  In Kenya, for example, that was exposed by the Kenyan Catholic Bishops Association thereafter lab testing.
[02:50:23.696 --> 02:50:28.679]  Africa has always been the testing ground for Western civilization's biological weapons.
[02:50:28.679 --> 02:50:34.822]  This is why even the government of Nigeria issued criminal charges against executives of Pfizer.
[02:50:35.382 --> 02:50:39.845]  Pharmaceutical Corporation for running medical experiments that killed Nigerian children.
[02:50:39.845 --> 02:50:42.866]  And that's just one among probably hundreds of examples.
[02:50:42.866 --> 02:50:43.487]  And that's admitted.
[02:50:43.487 --> 02:50:48.250]  So you would say, what's the headline then for this?
[02:50:48.250 --> 02:50:50.571]  Global Ascendant Bioweapon Mules?
[02:50:50.571 --> 02:50:54.453]  I mean... It's, again, it's a cover.
[02:50:54.453 --> 02:51:02.678]  So, by allowing Ebola-exposed individuals into the United States, they can release biological weapons, blame
[02:51:03.530 --> 02:51:09.120]  They could even blame Texas for not containing it when in fact it's the globalists that are releasing it.
[02:51:09.784 --> 02:51:20.012]  But there's an element of this that could backfire, Alex, and that is that these biological weapons, they tend to have much higher fatalities in cities.
[02:51:20.012 --> 02:51:28.179]  And it's the cities in America that's where liberals and Democrats tend to be in higher concentrations, obviously.
[02:51:28.179 --> 02:51:39.268]  And if they're not careful about this, if they release a bioweapon, it could end up causing massive fatalities in liberal cities, while having a much lower fatality rate in rural areas, which
[02:51:39.708 --> 02:51:42.810]  Have natural defenses against viral infections.
[02:51:42.810 --> 02:51:44.792]  For example, more sunlight.
[02:51:44.792 --> 02:51:47.173]  You don't have the dark subways.
[02:51:47.173 --> 02:51:48.654]  You know people congregating.
[02:51:48.654 --> 02:51:49.495]  So let me ask you this.
[02:51:49.495 --> 02:51:51.676]  Yeah.
[02:51:51.676 --> 02:51:54.998]  Past behavior is the most indicative of future behavior.
[02:51:54.998 --> 02:51:57.340]  They just cover up TB, drug-resistant spreading.
[02:51:57.340 --> 02:51:59.682]  They just cover up all the different diseases coming from their world.
[02:52:00.490 --> 02:52:04.853]  So, so far they just think we'll just practice bringing in tens of thousands of Africans every week.
[02:52:04.853 --> 02:52:08.435]  We'll just cover up, you know, they bring Ebola, kind of like they did five years ago.
[02:52:08.435 --> 02:52:11.997]  We know Ebola got into the U.S., they later admitted it, but it was kept quiet.
[02:52:11.997 --> 02:52:18.701]  But like you said, it's just so damn reckless to advertise that we've totally collapsed and now it's this bad.
[02:52:18.701 --> 02:52:23.183]  But I just guess they think political correctness and control of media will keep it out of the news.
[02:52:23.183 --> 02:52:23.764]  As I said, Mike,
[02:52:24.404 --> 02:52:25.265]  You've reported it.
[02:52:25.265 --> 02:52:26.386]  Drudge Reports reported it.
[02:52:26.386 --> 02:52:27.706]  We've reported it.
[02:52:27.706 --> 02:52:30.588]  One TV station in San Antonio has reported it.
[02:52:30.588 --> 02:52:32.830]  The Border Patrol released a video a week ago.
[02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:35.932]  They called me, like I said, and said, Alex, it's much worse.
[02:52:35.932 --> 02:52:38.694]  Can you get Fox to cover it as if I have power?
[02:52:38.694 --> 02:52:41.356]  And it just shows the incredible control going on.
[02:52:43.005 --> 02:53:00.627]  Along those lines, by the way, there's some breaking news that I wanted to mention here today that's exactly related to this, is that the MailChimp service has, as of this morning, started banning the sending of any email to any list that contains information about vaccine safety.
[02:53:01.287 --> 02:53:01.828]  Let's be clear.
[02:53:01.828 --> 02:53:04.832]  They're the biggest email service out there outside of like Google.
[02:53:04.832 --> 02:53:06.755]  They are scanning what people are sending out.
[02:53:06.755 --> 02:53:07.396]  They banned us.
[02:53:07.396 --> 02:53:09.479]  They banned Watson completely.
[02:53:09.479 --> 02:53:13.705]  And now they're reading what you send, even on a service you pay for, and saying what you can send.
[02:53:14.534 --> 02:53:15.675]  Yes, yes.
[02:53:15.675 --> 02:53:18.437]  And so, other groups have reported this this morning.
[02:53:18.437 --> 02:53:21.439]  I've had tips coming in from half a dozen people so far.
[02:53:21.439 --> 02:53:27.403]  But I've also, I was warned about this from another source who also warned me that we were going to be taken down by Facebook.
[02:53:27.403 --> 02:53:29.064]  I was warned over a month ago.
[02:53:29.064 --> 02:53:32.146]  That same source told me that the censorship that's about to hit
[02:53:32.726 --> 02:53:43.437]  Is going to censor any online information that talks about clean water, clean food, clean vaccines, or anything about pesticides and herbicides.
[02:53:43.437 --> 02:53:50.204]  So the censorship that has been accelerating from the political realm, you know, censoring conservatives and Trump supporters and so on,
[02:53:50.956 --> 02:53:54.421]  Very soon, if you talk about glyphosate, you will be censored.
[02:53:54.421 --> 02:53:57.986]  If you talk about the need for water filters, you will be censored.
[02:53:57.986 --> 02:54:01.651]  Because the message is that all the chemicals are totally safe.
[02:54:01.651 --> 02:54:03.694]  They'll say, you don't need to filter your water.
[02:54:03.694 --> 02:54:07.139]  Oh, David Hogg famously attacked me and said, do not filter your water.
[02:54:07.139 --> 02:54:07.800]  It's good.
[02:54:08.652 --> 02:54:10.193]  That's right, that's right.
[02:54:10.193 --> 02:54:15.335]  And they're even calling it now, they have a term for it, I've been labeled this, chem-phobic.
[02:54:15.335 --> 02:54:21.697]  So if you don't love all the toxic chemicals, you're labeled chem-phobic.
[02:54:21.697 --> 02:54:23.117]  And it's going to include heavy metals.
[02:54:23.117 --> 02:54:30.300]  That's what David Hogg said, everything he's told is given to him in a script, he admitted, is that these are good chemicals, we need these.
[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:32.301]  He said, we need to drink these.
[02:54:32.301 --> 02:54:35.042]  The crowd's like, yes, we're not chem-phobic.
[02:54:36.334 --> 02:54:38.236]  Right, so think about what's happening here.
[02:54:38.236 --> 02:54:43.180]  Again, the potential Ebola invasion, the use of biological weapons systems.
[02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:44.021]  We know the U.S.
[02:54:44.021 --> 02:54:48.605]  military has been running biological weapons research for many years.
[02:54:48.605 --> 02:54:55.832]  What if some of those specimens got into the hands of some deep state people who plan to use this to try to destroy America and take down Trump?
[02:54:56.212 --> 02:54:59.997]  Well, that's why they mysteriously would take Ebola patients that weren't even citizens.
[02:54:59.997 --> 02:55:00.698]  Remember?
[02:55:00.698 --> 02:55:01.600]  Was it five years ago?
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:03.262]  Or how many years ago was that, Mike?
[02:55:03.262 --> 02:55:04.163]  You wrote hundreds of articles.
[02:55:04.163 --> 02:55:04.624]  We did it too.
[02:55:04.624 --> 02:55:07.968]  It was like they were hiding these people in facilities that came out later.
[02:55:07.968 --> 02:55:08.409]  We were right.
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:09.900]  Well, right.
[02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:15.823]  And remember, there was a CDC intelligence officer who was part of the disinformation campaign.
[02:55:15.823 --> 02:55:17.504]  She filed suit.
[02:55:17.504 --> 02:55:18.764]  I think she was in New York.
[02:55:18.764 --> 02:55:20.185]  We did an article on her.
[02:55:20.185 --> 02:55:25.427]  She was actually a graduate of the CDC intelligence operation, basically the vaccine deep state.
[02:55:25.427 --> 02:55:28.549]  And she was part of this saying that you can't quarantine people.
[02:55:28.549 --> 02:55:28.989]  Remember that?
[02:55:29.949 --> 02:55:32.670]  When they were putting people in quarantines, she sued.
[02:55:32.670 --> 02:55:35.451]  She said, you can't quarantine people who have Ebola.
[02:55:35.451 --> 02:55:37.812]  And that, now we know why that precedent was set.
[02:55:37.812 --> 02:55:39.473]  My God, it's like 13 monkeys.
[02:55:39.473 --> 02:55:40.513]  They've been beta tested.
[02:55:40.513 --> 02:55:41.314]  Oh my God.
[02:55:41.314 --> 02:55:42.534]  Stay there, we're gonna come back.
[02:55:42.534 --> 02:55:43.895]  I gotta plug once today, folks.
[02:55:45.126 --> 02:55:45.866]  I got a lot going on.
[02:55:45.866 --> 02:55:46.527]  You got a lot going on.
[02:55:46.527 --> 02:55:49.048]  The news is so cutting edge, so hardcore.
[02:55:49.048 --> 02:55:50.789]  I'm not going to belabor products.
[02:55:50.789 --> 02:55:52.130]  You're awesome.
[02:55:52.130 --> 02:55:53.871]  You know we've got great products.
[02:55:53.871 --> 02:55:55.351]  Everybody needs fish oil.
[02:55:55.351 --> 02:55:57.713]  It's what your brain, your heart is built out of.
[02:55:57.713 --> 02:55:59.814]  For your children, for you.
[02:55:59.814 --> 02:56:00.654]  Our turmeric is the best.
[02:56:00.654 --> 02:56:01.775]  95% human oil.
[02:56:01.775 --> 02:56:03.616]  We pay a lot extra for bodies.
[02:56:03.616 --> 02:56:04.996]  We sell them at a low price.
[02:56:04.996 --> 02:56:07.578]  We have a super force special DNA force pack in stock.
[02:56:08.619 --> 02:56:11.301]  50% off, Brain Force Plus back in stock, 50% off.
[02:56:11.301 --> 02:56:16.265]  TurboForce, our great new product that already sold out, second batch in, 50% off.
[02:56:16.265 --> 02:56:22.570]  But whatever you do, you understand your funding of this is the lifeblood.
[02:56:22.570 --> 02:56:25.452]  And the globalists go around the clock trying to shut us down.
[02:56:25.452 --> 02:56:28.315]  So let me just say this.
[02:56:28.315 --> 02:56:34.560]  The credit for what we've done goes to the audience, 90% and to this group.
[02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:36.902]  And I just want you to know that without you, we wouldn't be here.
[02:56:38.277 --> 02:56:39.818]  And I'm very thankful.
[02:56:39.818 --> 02:56:43.201]  And I want to be strong going into these times for this fight.
[02:56:43.201 --> 02:56:56.191]  I want to be strong against the enemy, and I just want to ask listeners, get your fish oil, get your non-GMO, high-quality coffee, get your toothpaste that's non-fluoride, chlorosilver, iodine, fortified.
[02:56:56.191 --> 02:57:00.915]  Get staples you're going to get over and over again, like protein bars are so good.
[02:57:00.915 --> 02:57:06.340]  Get them and sign up for auto-ship, cancel anytime for free, so you don't forget when you make that order today.
[02:57:07.475 --> 02:57:15.259]  All the time I run out of stuff and I'm like, I need to stop, I need to auto-ship, so I do that now, because I get busy and don't drive over to the warehouse two miles away and get stuff for myself.
[02:57:15.259 --> 02:57:26.345]  So just sign up for auto-ship, cancelling time, but so you're committed, every 15 days, every month, every two months, every, up to nine months, you can, every nine months get the coffee, every nine months get the,
[02:57:28.217 --> 02:57:28.717]  Fish oil.
[02:57:28.717 --> 02:57:29.758]  Every nine months to the D.N.A.
[02:57:29.758 --> 02:57:30.098]  port.
[02:57:30.098 --> 02:57:31.579]  Most people need it every month.
[02:57:31.579 --> 02:57:34.160]  And this, when you can afford it, you got it, it comes in.
[02:57:34.160 --> 02:57:37.642]  Whether it's five dollars or a hundred dollars a month, we need that money to fight.
[02:57:37.642 --> 02:57:38.963]  These are war bonds.

[02:59:48.797 --> 03:00:02.364]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:02.364 --> 03:00:13.250]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[03:00:17.444 --> 03:00:20.405]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:20.405 --> 03:00:25.566]  So... Little me this, Batman.
[03:00:25.566 --> 03:00:28.747]  We've got the second biggest outbreak of Ebola in world history.
[03:00:28.747 --> 03:00:30.607]  They say it may be the biggest.
[03:00:30.607 --> 03:00:35.068]  Thousands dead, tens of thousands infected in the Congo.
[03:00:35.068 --> 03:00:43.031]  And thousands of people are coming into Mexico and then coming across the Rio Grande and then showing up at San Antonio shelters.
[03:00:43.031 --> 03:00:44.711]  And it's only on one news channel.
[03:00:46.940 --> 03:00:50.842]  The news shows people coming across, but they don't point out the Ebola threat.
[03:00:50.842 --> 03:00:55.784]  And then suddenly on the news, they're going, don't worry, we've got an Ebola vaccine for you.
[03:00:55.784 --> 03:01:00.146]  I understand the Border Patrol's overwhelmed.
[03:01:00.146 --> 03:01:03.247]  I understand there's 5,000 people a day they're catching.
[03:01:03.247 --> 03:01:06.909]  Probably double that are getting, you know, buy them, 100-something thousand a month.
[03:01:08.237 --> 03:01:10.538]  But riddle me this, Batman.
[03:01:10.538 --> 03:01:26.864]  Why wouldn't they particularly, people saying, we're from the Congo, we're fleeing Ebola, and then the DHS just says, which is leftist run still, just release them, send them to these aid groups in Texas, and then distribute them out all over the country.
[03:01:26.864 --> 03:01:29.065]  We have local newscasts admitting that.
[03:01:29.065 --> 03:01:31.485]  The 12 monkeys with Bruce Willis is fiction.
[03:01:33.459 --> 03:01:36.440]  This isn't fiction, and it just shows the recklessness.
[03:01:36.440 --> 03:01:38.701]  What happens if Ebola gets in?
[03:01:38.701 --> 03:01:40.261]  Are the politicians not worried?
[03:01:40.261 --> 03:01:42.322]  Mike Adams, what do you think?
[03:01:42.322 --> 03:01:52.465]  Well, let's remember, too, that after the Ebola scare from a couple of years ago, there was more research done on the incubation period of Ebola, and they found that Ebola can remain viable
[03:01:52.841 --> 03:01:55.123]  So it's like a perfect bio-weapon carrier then?
[03:02:20.163 --> 03:02:20.823]  Well, exactly.
[03:02:20.823 --> 03:02:23.224]  That's, you know, 12 monkeys.
[03:02:23.224 --> 03:02:27.445]  Someone, I think, released it in the airport in a canister.
[03:02:27.445 --> 03:02:29.606]  But it doesn't have to be that way.
[03:02:29.606 --> 03:02:32.046]  It can be put into people.
[03:02:32.046 --> 03:02:41.569]  They could have infected a thousand people, taken the 50 of them who were symptomless carriers, and then now transported those 50 people into Texas.
[03:02:42.229 --> 03:02:43.569]  And why would they target Texas?
[03:02:43.569 --> 03:02:47.670]  Well, they want to bring down the most pro-liberty state in America.
[03:02:47.670 --> 03:02:56.752]  Governor Abbott just signed a bill, by the way, that guaranteed free speech on Texas college campuses, along with many other bills that he's just signed.
[03:02:56.752 --> 03:02:58.153]  So Texas is being targeted.
[03:02:58.153 --> 03:03:00.993]  If you're asking, why are they being put into Texas?
[03:03:00.993 --> 03:03:07.535]  Remember, Obama wouldn't even give, like seven years ago, federal funding for all the wildfires we had.
[03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:10.841]  That only happened over like 50 years, that bad.
[03:03:10.841 --> 03:03:13.981]  In a drought, we have a drought over 50 years, it's well known in Texas.
[03:03:13.981 --> 03:03:14.901]  It's cyclical.
[03:03:14.901 --> 03:03:16.222]  He wouldn't even give support.
[03:03:16.222 --> 03:03:17.562]  Wow.
[03:03:17.562 --> 03:03:18.342]  Yeah.
[03:03:18.342 --> 03:03:28.384]  So, I think that this is part of what very well could be a massive effort, a biological weapon delivery system and a cover story.
[03:03:28.384 --> 03:03:32.945]  And again, the thing that the globalists love about biological weapons is they're self-replicating.
[03:03:32.945 --> 03:03:36.846]  They essentially threaten to depopulate the planet, which is one of their top goals.
[03:03:36.846 --> 03:03:37.906]  And they don't have fingerprints.
[03:03:38.985 --> 03:03:39.185]  Right.
[03:03:39.185 --> 03:03:45.568]  It can never be traced back to anybody, especially after it begins to mutate in the wild, as all viral strains do, including Ebola.
[03:03:45.568 --> 03:03:47.809]  There's not just one set Ebola.
[03:03:47.809 --> 03:03:49.450]  There are different variations of Ebola.
[03:03:50.209 --> 03:03:55.593]  And some of them can be more infectious to people of different genetic predispositions, by the way.
[03:03:55.593 --> 03:04:03.438]  There can be strains that quite literally target people who are of European descent, or strains that target people of African descent, for example.
[03:04:03.438 --> 03:04:03.998]  That's well-known.
[03:04:03.998 --> 03:04:06.320]  This is just straight-up science here.
[03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:09.882]  This isn't fringe science I'm mentioning.
[03:04:09.882 --> 03:04:13.124]  Every microbiologist and virologist knows what I'm talking about here.
[03:04:13.124 --> 03:04:15.386]  This is mainline science, what you're saying.
[03:04:15.386 --> 03:04:16.146]  Exactly.
[03:04:16.146 --> 03:04:17.848]  Again, I'm going to ask this question.
[03:04:17.848 --> 03:04:19.829]  We're going to take a break, come back, and get into the censorship.
[03:04:20.669 --> 03:04:23.251]  Mike Adams, 30-second answer.
[03:04:23.251 --> 03:04:24.772]  Or answer when we come back.
[03:04:24.772 --> 03:04:26.894]  What does it signify, the news blackout?
[03:04:26.894 --> 03:04:28.655]  Because I'm going to say this again.
[03:04:28.655 --> 03:04:33.198]  Drudge has aggressively had our story up for two days, top deal.
[03:04:33.198 --> 03:04:34.479]  He's trying to make people cover it.
[03:04:34.479 --> 03:04:37.001]  Hell, it's a local newscast, it's not even us.
[03:04:37.001 --> 03:04:38.401]  And there's no coverage.
[03:04:38.401 --> 03:04:40.643]  What does that say?
[03:04:40.643 --> 03:04:43.525]  It shows that this is a big deal.
[03:04:43.525 --> 03:04:46.367]  At the highest levels, they're telling news not to cover this, folks.
[03:04:47.608 --> 03:04:47.828]  That's 100%.
[03:04:47.828 --> 03:04:50.931]  This story is sensational.
[03:04:50.931 --> 03:04:54.154]  And there's a blackout.
[03:04:54.154 --> 03:04:59.599]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[03:04:59.599 --> 03:05:01.381]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[03:05:01.381 --> 03:05:03.142]  Now I can be there for my children.
[03:05:03.142 --> 03:05:04.984]  Now I can make them strong.
[03:05:04.984 --> 03:05:06.625]  Now I can instruct them.
[03:05:06.625 --> 03:05:08.347]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[03:05:08.347 --> 03:05:09.348]  But not once I'm gone.
[03:05:09.448 --> 03:05:14.571]  You think in this digital age, your word's going forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:05:14.571 --> 03:05:20.175]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:05:20.175 --> 03:05:23.818]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[03:05:23.818 --> 03:05:28.781]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[03:05:28.781 --> 03:05:35.686]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[03:05:35.686 --> 03:05:39.328]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[03:05:39.448 --> 03:05:47.059]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:05:47.059 --> 03:05:53.668]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:06:06.616 --> 03:06:10.771]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[03:06:10.771 --> 03:06:12.236]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:19.281 --> 03:06:21.463]  Now Gerald Cilente is about to take over.
[03:06:21.463 --> 03:06:22.644]  The war room is coming up.
[03:06:22.644 --> 03:06:25.767]  I'll be co-hosting some of that with the crew.
[03:06:25.767 --> 03:06:27.248]  We've got our crew in the field.
[03:06:27.248 --> 03:06:32.993]  The reports are about to come in at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:06:32.993 --> 03:06:39.139]  I talked to our Border Patrol sources this morning, and you've seen a lot of those on camera with us, some of them off camera.
[03:06:39.779 --> 03:06:43.321]  And they just said, listen, there's thousands of Africans from Congo coming in.
[03:06:43.321 --> 03:06:47.683]  It's much worse than the 300 that are at this San Antonio facility in the one video we released.
[03:06:47.683 --> 03:06:48.803]  That's just the video we got.
[03:06:48.803 --> 03:06:49.584]  We tracked them there.
[03:06:49.584 --> 03:06:53.526]  We've been ordered to release them because there's nowhere to put them and there's no facilities.
[03:06:53.526 --> 03:06:56.307]  And we think they should have been kept because of the Ebola threat.
[03:06:57.708 --> 03:07:00.469]  And they brought up the same thing about sexually transmitted.
[03:07:00.469 --> 03:07:01.810]  And then the crew was asking me about it.
[03:07:01.810 --> 03:07:04.431]  I'd forgotten they can live for like a year on the sperm.
[03:07:04.431 --> 03:07:05.651]  And then Mike was bringing that up.
[03:07:05.651 --> 03:07:08.833]  I mean, my head's spinning at this point.
[03:07:08.833 --> 03:07:12.354]  And by the way, the Border Patrol's head is spinning.
[03:07:12.354 --> 03:07:13.995]  They said, how do we get this to Hannity?
[03:07:13.995 --> 03:07:16.396]  How do we get this to Tucker Carlson?
[03:07:16.396 --> 03:07:17.596]  This was this morning.
[03:07:17.596 --> 03:07:20.237]  As soon as I get off air, I'm going to make some phone calls.
[03:07:20.237 --> 03:07:24.079]  But you don't think Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity don't know all about this?
[03:07:25.558 --> 03:07:28.459]  There is a blackout and orders are coming down.
[03:07:28.459 --> 03:07:30.300]  I haven't been told that by Hannity.
[03:07:30.300 --> 03:07:32.741]  I haven't been told that by Carlson.
[03:07:32.741 --> 03:07:37.303]  But believe me, I know a huge important story when I see one.
[03:07:37.303 --> 03:07:41.145]  Just African migrants, period, showing up in mass is big.
[03:07:41.145 --> 03:07:44.006]  But from an Ebola ravaged area, when U.S.
[03:07:44.006 --> 03:07:48.788]  citizens that come from there get put in quarantine for a month, this is unprecedented.
[03:07:48.788 --> 03:07:51.770]  And then you've got the New York Times cover story.
[03:07:51.770 --> 03:07:53.951]  The New York Times is not that important in their reach.
[03:07:55.077 --> 03:07:58.621]  But the establishment still gets its talking points from it.
[03:07:58.621 --> 03:08:15.439]  And when they say we're about to ban everybody, including anybody that's on the edge of the fringe, or we're going to ban liberals that believe in free speech, like Mr. Rubin, you know it signifies what Mike Adams of naturalnews.com was just saying, big escalations.
[03:08:16.980 --> 03:08:24.842]  Consumer advocacy, like they're removing off all sorts of review sites, reviews of drugs, reviews of vaccines.
[03:08:24.842 --> 03:08:35.165]  Well, the thing you trust more when you're going to a restaurant or a grocery store or a hotel or an airline or a school or a church is reviews.
[03:08:36.220 --> 03:08:38.681]  They're saying, oh, disinfo.
[03:08:38.681 --> 03:08:43.663]  Vaccine makers and drug makers say you can't do that at one of the biggest review sites.
[03:08:43.663 --> 03:08:48.206]  Well, that's natural news with their $10 million research facility with accredited scientists.
[03:08:48.206 --> 03:08:50.226]  That's banned everywhere.
[03:08:50.226 --> 03:08:53.308]  And MailChimp says, we're reading your email, Mike Adams.
[03:08:53.308 --> 03:08:53.988]  We're reading your email.
[03:08:53.988 --> 03:08:55.529]  You can't send that.
[03:08:55.529 --> 03:08:59.371]  You can't show somebody an ABC report of some woman dying from a vaccine.
[03:09:00.131 --> 03:09:03.433]  So, it really shows panic mode by the establishment.
[03:09:03.433 --> 03:09:14.058]  My problem is, Mike, we've lived with so much freedom for so long, I don't think people realize the magnitude of how serious this is, and that all the censorship so far was just, I think, a test.
[03:09:14.058 --> 03:09:16.439]  The dam broke in the last week.
[03:09:16.439 --> 03:09:18.920]  This is the full assault ahead of a big event.
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:20.621]  I don't think there's any way to deny that.
[03:09:20.621 --> 03:09:22.062]  Is it a coup against Trump?
[03:09:22.062 --> 03:09:23.483]  Is it master Ebola outbreaks?
[03:09:23.483 --> 03:09:24.603]  Is it a new war?
[03:09:24.603 --> 03:09:25.524]  It's all in the cards.
[03:09:25.524 --> 03:09:25.944]  What do you think?
[03:09:26.710 --> 03:09:29.532]  Well, it's more than a coup against Trump, although that's where it begins.
[03:09:29.532 --> 03:09:39.837]  But according to the information I'm getting from sources, number one, the FDA is going to outlaw CBD as a dietary supplement through regulatory control.
[03:09:39.837 --> 03:09:41.618]  They've already held meetings on that.
[03:09:41.618 --> 03:09:42.399]  They're working on that.
[03:09:42.999 --> 03:09:50.882]  They are completely scared of the fact that CBD can replace so many prescription medications for certain people.
[03:09:50.882 --> 03:09:57.485]  You know, CBD cannabinoids are quite medicinal in many different ways, and that's freaking out the FDA, so they're coming after that.
[03:09:57.485 --> 03:10:03.167]  But the bigger news is that not only is MailChimp censoring all emails now about vaccines,
[03:10:03.767 --> 03:10:12.050]  And of course, Google and YouTube and Twitter, all censoring information about natural health, organics, anti-cancer foods is a big one that they're going to start censoring now.
[03:10:12.050 --> 03:10:18.532]  So if you talk about molecules in food, for example, broccoli contains a molecule called sulforaphane.
[03:10:18.532 --> 03:10:23.334]  Sulforaphane is a very potent anti-cancer molecule and it exists as a molecule.
[03:10:23.334 --> 03:10:24.955]  It's the laws of physics and chemistry.
[03:10:24.955 --> 03:10:27.036]  Why are you cancer-phobic?
[03:10:27.036 --> 03:10:27.936]  Why are you cancer-phobic?
[03:10:28.857 --> 03:10:30.698]  Right, they'll say that it's fake news.
[03:10:30.698 --> 03:10:33.659]  They'll say it's fake news, there's no such thing as a cancer food.
[03:10:33.659 --> 03:10:45.265]  But you have to take their chemotherapy drugs, but if you talk about the dangers of chemotherapy, or the fact that the number one side effect of chemotherapy is cancer, then you will of course be labeled fake news and you will be banned.
[03:10:45.265 --> 03:10:46.826]  Sure, so bottom line is, whether we're wrong or right.
[03:10:47.446 --> 03:10:48.447]  And obviously we're right.
[03:10:48.447 --> 03:10:57.031]  They don't want people having access to all the studies and all the facts that iodine raises IQ, lack of it lowers it.
[03:10:57.031 --> 03:10:58.412]  That's government studies.
[03:10:58.412 --> 03:11:00.072]  Fluoride lowers IQ.
[03:11:00.072 --> 03:11:02.053]  Good halogens raise IQ.
[03:11:02.053 --> 03:11:05.515]  They're panicking and they've just gotten really greedy.
[03:11:05.515 --> 03:11:06.836]  I mean, hell, it's amazing.
[03:11:07.836 --> 03:11:09.237]  It's going to get even worse.
[03:11:09.237 --> 03:11:11.257]  So two more things that are going to be happening.
[03:11:11.257 --> 03:11:19.060]  Number one, Amazon.com will be abandoning many small retailers or sellers of natural products.
[03:11:19.060 --> 03:11:21.481]  Herbs, superfoods, nutritional supplements.
[03:11:21.481 --> 03:11:23.902]  They're moving in the direction of... Is that because he bought Whole Foods now?
[03:11:23.902 --> 03:11:25.543]  He wants a monopoly?
[03:11:25.543 --> 03:11:26.363]  No.
[03:11:26.363 --> 03:11:27.944]  No, it's actually... There's a pressure on him.
[03:11:29.597 --> 03:11:39.982]  Yeah, an order has gone out that everybody now who is part of the globalists has to be anti-nutrition, anti-organics, anti-clean food, and anti-clean water.
[03:11:39.982 --> 03:11:46.265]  And so, you're going to see vitamins on Amazon in the future, but they'll be the synthetic, toxic versions of the vitamins.
[03:11:46.265 --> 03:11:49.647]  You know, not the good form of B12, but the toxic cyanocobalamin.
[03:11:49.647 --> 03:11:51.128]  Big Pharma giving you what they want.
[03:11:51.903 --> 03:11:54.608]  Right, yeah, big pharma vitamins, which are toxic.
[03:11:54.608 --> 03:12:00.999]  Because it becomes too obvious when all the patriots are healthy and our kids are healthy, and then everybody else is dying.
[03:12:00.999 --> 03:12:01.620]  You can't have that.
[03:12:03.067 --> 03:12:03.728]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:12:03.728 --> 03:12:11.853]  But the endgame of this phase is to criminalize online speech about nutrition and health.
[03:12:11.853 --> 03:12:22.839]  And this was tried already in a state in the United States, I forgot which state it was, but we can look it up, where they tried to say only registered dieticians can talk about nutrition online.
[03:12:22.839 --> 03:12:26.502]  That was shot down, but it was a test case and they're going to try to bring it back.
[03:12:26.502 --> 03:12:28.603]  So, Alex, it's not just the censorship.
[03:12:29.341 --> 03:12:33.784]  They're not only coming after you and your store and your nutritional products and mine as well.
[03:12:33.784 --> 03:12:41.189]  They're going to try to criminalize anybody who says there's such a thing as an anti-cancer molecule found in Brussels sprouts.
[03:12:41.189 --> 03:12:44.332]  Or that if you don't have vitamin C, you get scurvy and cancer.
[03:12:45.072 --> 03:12:46.373]  Or if you don't have oxygen, you die.
[03:12:46.373 --> 03:12:47.634]  If you don't have water.
[03:12:47.634 --> 03:12:51.516]  In fact, I've read where the FDA says you can't say you've got to have oxygen to live.
[03:12:51.516 --> 03:12:54.438]  You can't say you need water or die in five days without it.
[03:12:54.438 --> 03:12:58.041]  You can't say you need vitamin C even though it's a total admitted fact.
[03:12:58.041 --> 03:13:00.142]  All right, Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com.
[03:13:00.142 --> 03:13:00.963]  Thank you so much.
[03:13:00.963 --> 03:13:01.423]  Keep it up.
[03:13:01.423 --> 03:13:02.344]  A lot of critical reporting.
[03:13:02.344 --> 03:13:03.744]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:13:03.744 --> 03:13:04.145]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:13:05.336 --> 03:13:08.558]  Folks, you just heard Mike, and it's insane.
[03:13:08.558 --> 03:13:12.200]  And I'm not up here as the guru of taking the best care of myself.
[03:13:12.200 --> 03:13:19.926]  But I know this, if I didn't have X2 Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, and the 30, 40, 50 pounds I lost on that, I'd never even work out anymore.
[03:13:19.926 --> 03:13:23.568]  I weighed 40, 50 pounds more five years ago than I do now.
[03:13:23.568 --> 03:13:29.512]  But I used to have sunspots all over my skin, and they told me this, when you take Reliodine, it's going to deal with that.
[03:13:30.632 --> 03:13:39.464]  It's not the same for everybody, but you know, yeah, like David Hogg said, Jones says the ground table water is full of pesticides and then he sells filters.
[03:13:39.464 --> 03:13:41.187]  Exactly!
[03:13:41.187 --> 03:13:46.935]  If I was going to sell cars, I'd find out what the safest and best value was and I'd go promote that car.
[03:13:47.876 --> 03:13:57.421]  Well, if the groundwater is full of a bunch of poison, and all the studies show you should filter your water with good filters that do it, I go out and find the best filters for the best price, and I sell those.
[03:13:57.421 --> 03:14:11.568]  And if I know that turmeric is a great antioxidant, and a great anti-inflammatory, and just great for everything in your life, I go find the best factory, the best organic group, the already best rated thing that's 90% curcuminoid, and I go, I spent more money, could you make it stronger?
[03:14:11.568 --> 03:14:12.648]  And they go, yeah.
[03:14:12.648 --> 03:14:15.189]  Our machines can make it 95% curcuminoid.
[03:14:15.189 --> 03:14:16.230]  You'll be the best in the country.
[03:14:17.185 --> 03:14:18.945]  I called three other places and confirmed.
[03:14:18.945 --> 03:14:20.026]  They're like, we don't go above 80.
[03:14:20.026 --> 03:14:21.666]  There's no point.
[03:14:21.666 --> 03:14:22.126]  Well, you know what?
[03:14:22.126 --> 03:14:23.966]  We got 95% humanoid.
[03:14:23.966 --> 03:14:25.567]  It's bodies.
[03:14:25.567 --> 03:14:30.588]  And so, I'm a superstitious person and I believe metaphysically.
[03:14:30.588 --> 03:14:32.808]  If I was some book, I just feel it.
[03:14:32.808 --> 03:14:38.289]  That if I try to give you the very best and I do the best job I can, I'm going to win.
[03:14:38.289 --> 03:14:41.130]  If I think about screwing somebody over or cutting corners, I start
[03:14:42.130 --> 03:14:43.331]  Literally shaking.
[03:14:43.331 --> 03:14:47.074]  It's the only fear I have is screwing somebody over who hadn't had it coming to him.
[03:14:47.074 --> 03:14:54.559]  Like Tony Montana says in the fictional Scarface, I ain't ever screwed nobody over who didn't have it coming to them, didn't ask for it, didn't screw me over first.
[03:14:54.559 --> 03:15:00.844]  So all I'm saying is we're only here because of you and all the products at InfoWarsTore.com are the very best we can bring you.
[03:15:00.844 --> 03:15:10.431]  There's a bunch of specials right now and without you funding us, we won't be here in the future to talk about all the incredible things that Mike Adams was just breaking down.
[03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:15.043]  Because it's not just him saying it, it's in the news.
[03:15:15.043 --> 03:15:17.025]  That they're going to try to ban all the supplements.
[03:15:17.025 --> 03:15:19.608]  They're going to come after all your speech.
[03:15:19.608 --> 03:15:22.410]  They're coming after your guns.
[03:15:22.410 --> 03:15:24.973]  They've already gotten rid of your borders.
[03:15:24.973 --> 03:15:27.395]  They're just doing it all, folks.
[03:15:27.395 --> 03:15:30.098]  It's a bum rush because they know you woke up.
[03:15:31.360 --> 03:15:31.700]  I don't know.
[03:15:53.431 --> 03:15:54.952]  Oh, these pains.
[03:15:54.952 --> 03:15:57.493]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[03:15:57.493 --> 03:15:59.293]  I've got to get some relief.
[03:15:59.293 --> 03:16:01.054]  Stress from everyday life.
[03:16:01.054 --> 03:16:04.996]  Past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[03:16:04.996 --> 03:16:06.896]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[03:16:06.896 --> 03:16:08.677]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?

[03:17:42.241 --> 03:17:43.682]  Or warm and served.

[03:18:56.249 --> 03:19:01.491]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:19:01.491 --> 03:19:08.993]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we so love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:19:08.993 --> 03:19:10.314]  Are you coming back?
[03:19:10.314 --> 03:19:11.454]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:19:12.054 --> 03:19:13.436]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[03:19:13.436 --> 03:19:15.698]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.news.
[03:19:15.698 --> 03:19:17.420]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[03:19:17.420 --> 03:19:22.445]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[03:19:22.445 --> 03:19:24.707]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:19:24.707 --> 03:19:27.991]  InfoWars.com, man!
[03:19:27.991 --> 03:19:28.351]  Woo!
[03:19:31.059 --> 03:19:35.641]  InfoWars.com, because that's what people out here are going to know about InfoWars.com.
[03:19:35.641 --> 03:19:38.262]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:19:38.262 --> 03:19:40.583]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:19:40.583 --> 03:19:44.084]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.

[03:19:46.825 --> 03:19:49.106]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:19:49.106 --> 03:19:49.887]  That's where they find it.
[03:19:49.887 --> 03:19:51.927]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:19:51.927 --> 03:19:57.750]  Please go there.
[03:19:57.750 --> 03:20:00.391]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.070 --> 03:20:16.492]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:16.492 --> 03:20:19.173]  It's Gerald Solente.
[03:20:19.173 --> 03:20:22.475]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.475 --> 03:20:26.157]  Hey, thank you very much.
[03:20:26.157 --> 03:20:27.858]  Love being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:27.858 --> 03:20:30.379]  Yep, fighting corruption and it's everywhere.
[03:20:30.379 --> 03:20:32.020]  It's worldwide.
[03:20:32.020 --> 03:20:33.901]  I was listening to Alex speaking before.
[03:20:34.673 --> 03:20:40.677]  The gentleman talking about how he can't come out without not wanting to get vaccinated.
[03:20:40.677 --> 03:20:43.478]  You know, they won't let anything about natural healing.
[03:20:43.478 --> 03:20:47.601]  By the way, that was the first book I worked on, Natural Healing, back in 1986.
[03:20:47.601 --> 03:20:55.065]  I have an honorary doctorate from the National University of Health Sciences for the work I've done in integrative and complementary medicine.
[03:20:55.065 --> 03:20:58.207]  They may ban me from the Internet for saying that.
[03:20:58.207 --> 03:20:59.768]  No, you only got to get drugged up.
[03:20:59.768 --> 03:21:04.411]  I mean, how could anybody think that a child coming out of a mother's womb
[03:21:05.327 --> 03:21:15.392]  All of a sudden is injected with all these foreign, heavy duty injections as an infant coming out of the womb.
[03:21:15.392 --> 03:21:16.692]  And it's okay!
[03:21:16.692 --> 03:21:18.793]  We got the research to prove it!
[03:21:18.793 --> 03:21:21.394]  How dare you say anything else?
[03:21:21.394 --> 03:21:29.058]  It's only been going on since the beginning of humans, but they haven't been vaccinating only a couple of, what, hundred years or so.
[03:21:29.058 --> 03:21:30.418]  But it's okay now.
[03:21:30.418 --> 03:21:33.580]  Anyway, in talking about the repression of the media,
[03:21:34.153 --> 03:21:38.475]  One of our top trends for 2019 is censorship 2019.
[03:21:38.475 --> 03:21:43.698]  And you know those stinking Russians over there, how they taught us to hate the Russians, right?
[03:21:43.698 --> 03:21:49.100]  As lousy Russians, they hacked into the Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.
[03:21:49.100 --> 03:21:59.505]  And that's why she lost, not because people couldn't stand her and they had enough of her and they showed what a con artist she is, along with her husband.
[03:21:59.505 --> 03:22:01.086]  No, that had nothing to do with it.
[03:22:01.086 --> 03:22:02.487]  Anyway, you ready for this?
[03:22:03.939 --> 03:22:09.924]  And surprisingly, this is from the Toilet Paper Record, the New York Times, today.
[03:22:09.924 --> 03:22:14.988]  Free speech in Russia flourishes on YouTube!
[03:22:14.988 --> 03:22:17.930]  I'm not making this up!
[03:22:17.930 --> 03:22:30.200]  Free speech in Russia flourishes on YouTube as they're censoring all of us.
[03:22:30.200 --> 03:22:31.521]  Isn't that something?
[03:22:33.621 --> 03:22:38.442]  Mainstream television in Russia, stage managed by the Kremlin.
[03:22:38.442 --> 03:22:39.742]  Yeah.
[03:22:39.742 --> 03:22:51.944]  Like, mainstream TV in the United States isn't managed by, uh... the Washington Oarmasters and the Corporate Johns.
[03:22:51.944 --> 03:22:54.685]  That's why they got prostitutes working for them.
[03:22:54.685 --> 03:22:56.865]  This is propaganda, the way they write this.
[03:22:56.865 --> 03:22:58.025]  Who wrote this?
[03:22:58.025 --> 03:22:59.145]  Oh, this guy.
[03:22:59.145 --> 03:23:00.646]  Neil McFarquhar.
[03:23:00.646 --> 03:23:02.006]  Yeah, Farquhar.
[03:23:02.006 --> 03:23:02.686]  Yeah, you.
[03:23:02.686 --> 03:23:02.906]  Yeah.
[03:23:04.915 --> 03:23:07.977]  This guy is such a fraud.
[03:23:07.977 --> 03:23:12.861]  He always writes anti-Russian, hate-the-other-side stuff.
[03:23:12.861 --> 03:23:32.516]  But anyway, he goes on over here, barely mentioned our anti-Russian punk band, or Pussy Riot, or Alexia A. Navalny.
[03:23:32.516 --> 03:23:33.137]  Yeah, so what?
[03:23:33.575 --> 03:23:35.556]  They haven't mentioned two people in the media?
[03:23:35.556 --> 03:23:38.036]  Hey, they don't mention me on American media anymore.
[03:23:38.036 --> 03:23:39.017]  I speak on it all the time.
[03:23:39.017 --> 03:23:42.197]  I speak on Oprah, I speak on the Today Show, I speak on Good Morning America.
[03:23:42.197 --> 03:23:45.358]  Yeah, I guess they got that Russian influence, huh?
[03:23:45.358 --> 03:23:50.020]  I guess they banned me, anyway.
[03:23:50.020 --> 03:24:02.243]  The entire sociopolitical part of television is controlled by the authorities, says Leonard J. Kharfanov, an independent news analyst.
[03:24:02.773 --> 03:24:03.773]  Who has been shut out.
[03:24:03.773 --> 03:24:05.674]  This is how they quote one guy.
[03:24:05.674 --> 03:24:06.974]  But anyway.
[03:24:06.974 --> 03:24:15.076]  Yet voices that the government would mute are heard regularly by tens of millions of Russians in another format.
[03:24:15.076 --> 03:24:16.117]  YouTube.
[03:24:16.117 --> 03:24:20.778]  While they ban us here.
[03:24:20.778 --> 03:24:23.559]  Censorship.
[03:24:23.559 --> 03:24:25.819]  2019.
[03:24:25.819 --> 03:24:29.961]  Today I want to do a little bit of trend tracking.
[03:24:29.961 --> 03:24:31.501]  Current events form future trends.
[03:24:32.807 --> 03:24:34.887]  They don't teach you this in school.
[03:24:34.887 --> 03:24:36.688]  You only learn about history.
[03:24:36.688 --> 03:24:39.308]  And you gotta memorize the dates.
[03:24:39.308 --> 03:24:43.069]  They give you stupid tests to make sure you memorize them.
[03:24:43.069 --> 03:24:48.890]  Yeah, it's important to know history because tracking trends is an understanding of where we are, how we got here, and where we're going.
[03:24:48.890 --> 03:24:52.290]  But where we're going, it's off base.
[03:24:52.290 --> 03:24:57.291]  Can't find a university in the U.S.S.A.
[03:24:57.291 --> 03:25:00.752]  that teaches you how to look ahead anywhere else.
[03:25:00.752 --> 03:25:01.592]  So I want to show you
[03:25:03.746 --> 03:25:06.347]  How Current Events Form Future Trends.
[03:25:06.347 --> 03:25:11.868]  This isn't reported in the prestitute media.
[03:25:11.868 --> 03:25:18.750]  You know, this 5G new technology we've been writing a lot about in the Trends Journal.
[03:25:18.750 --> 03:25:22.071]  Mr. Tucci, one of our experts, writes about it.
[03:25:22.071 --> 03:25:23.071]  It's deadly stuff.
[03:25:23.071 --> 03:25:26.012]  There's study after study coming out.
[03:25:26.012 --> 03:25:28.093]  They banned it in Brussels.
[03:25:28.093 --> 03:25:29.953]  That's right.
[03:25:29.953 --> 03:25:32.974]  And now Prime Minister of Poland signs global appeal
[03:25:33.649 --> 03:25:37.990]  To stop 5G telecommunications transmission.
[03:25:37.990 --> 03:25:43.072]  This is from globalresearch.ca.
[03:25:43.072 --> 03:25:59.436]  And what is surely an unprecedented and groundbreaking action, the Prime Minister of Poland has personally backed an international appeal to stop the controversial rollout of 5G electromagnetic microwave telecommunication transmissions.
[03:25:59.436 --> 03:26:00.877]  We've done a lot of work on this.
[03:26:03.217 --> 03:26:17.343]  There have been no safety tests carried out to ensure its safety, in spite of the fact that 5G operates at between 10 and 100 times higher frequencies than current 3 and 4G cell phone tower transmitters.
[03:26:17.343 --> 03:26:27.487]  And now these are going to be in a neighborhood, on a block, on a telephone pole, on a pole next to you.
[03:26:27.487 --> 03:26:31.249]  Up and down the neighborhood, the hoods.
[03:26:31.249 --> 03:26:31.809]  That's right.
[03:26:32.605 --> 03:26:35.006]  The murderers are going to put this out.
[03:26:35.006 --> 03:26:41.370]  The same people, you know, that we were manufacturing years ago, like we had General Electric.
[03:26:41.370 --> 03:26:44.853]  Yeah, with all the PCBs they dumped in the Hudson River.
[03:26:44.853 --> 03:26:55.219]  Yeah, they know they're doing this stuff, but they're greedy SOBs that'll do anything to make a buck.
[03:26:55.219 --> 03:27:01.703]  The 5G rollout will involve the placement of millions of transmitter boxes at distances of no more
[03:27:03.697 --> 03:27:08.180]  Then 10 to 12 houses apart in urban areas.
[03:27:08.180 --> 03:27:20.186]  Scientists have established that this will subject citizens living in urban areas to unavoidable barrage of electromagnetic pollution.
[03:27:20.186 --> 03:27:23.709]  This is serious.
[03:27:23.709 --> 03:27:33.174]  There's even studies on cell phones as well, but they're ignored and probably they'll ban them from YouTube and Twitter, Facebook,
[03:27:34.278 --> 03:27:36.580]  Yep.
[03:27:36.580 --> 03:27:42.484]  So, tune into this, get hip with it, and try to stop it, because it can be stopped.
[03:27:42.484 --> 03:27:52.131]  Matter of fact, up here in Woodstock, not far from us over here, I'm in Kingston, New York, 15 minutes away, they're protesting 5G.
[03:27:52.131 --> 03:28:01.397]  So, I want to talk a lot today about a number of different issues, and of course the jobs report that came out.
[03:28:01.397 --> 03:28:02.178]  On Friday,
[03:28:05.623 --> 03:28:12.526]  The labor force participation rate is still only at 62.8.
[03:28:12.526 --> 03:28:16.167]  Back when I was a young man, it used to run about 67, 68.
[03:28:16.167 --> 03:28:21.129]  So it's down.
[03:28:21.129 --> 03:28:23.830]  So these numbers aren't real.
[03:28:23.830 --> 03:28:26.191]  And the jobs stink.
[03:28:26.191 --> 03:28:28.312]  We have the report that shows what they are.
[03:28:28.312 --> 03:28:34.574]  The 10 jobs experiencing the fastest pay growth right now.
[03:28:35.629 --> 03:28:36.850]  They're not great.
[03:28:36.850 --> 03:28:39.873]  When we come back, we're going to tell you more about them.
[03:28:39.873 --> 03:28:42.055]  And remember, support InfoWare.
[03:28:42.055 --> 03:28:42.656]  I do.
[03:28:53.414 --> 03:28:54.935]  Oh, these pains.
[03:28:54.935 --> 03:28:57.476]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[03:28:57.476 --> 03:28:59.276]  I've got to get some relief.
[03:28:59.276 --> 03:29:04.979]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[03:29:04.979 --> 03:29:06.879]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[03:29:06.879 --> 03:29:08.660]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?

[03:31:59.181 --> 03:32:07.745]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:32:07.745 --> 03:32:10.727]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:32:10.727 --> 03:32:12.467]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:32:12.467 --> 03:32:18.750]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[03:32:29.116 --> 03:32:32.718]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:32:32.718 --> 03:32:37.020]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:32:37.020 --> 03:32:38.841]  I've got two in my home.

[03:32:44.944 --> 03:32:45.785]  Don't live

[03:32:57.274 --> 03:32:59.936]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.787 --> 03:33:18.707]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:18.707 --> 03:33:27.549]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:27.549 --> 03:33:31.730]  Hey, great being here, great being here.
[03:33:31.730 --> 03:33:36.571]  And yes, that Alexa Pure Breeze Air Purifier.
[03:33:36.571 --> 03:33:38.852]  All that dirty air out there.
[03:33:38.852 --> 03:33:40.292]  All the stuff they're throwing up.
[03:33:41.258 --> 03:33:47.402]  Into the water, into the air, into the earth, and that's why you need these products to keep you healthy.
[03:33:47.402 --> 03:33:54.847]  And it's 33% off, and it's for a limited time, only at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:54.847 --> 03:34:06.435]  It's really important you support InfoWars, as well, of course, the Trends Journal and the rest of us that are not the prestitutes, that say what we believe, not what we're told to do.
[03:34:06.435 --> 03:34:09.337]  And, um, that's all it is out there.
[03:34:10.285 --> 03:34:12.467]  Bunch of people getting paid to put out.
[03:34:12.467 --> 03:34:14.388]  They call it the media.
[03:34:14.388 --> 03:34:21.433]  Now, I told you I want to do some things on what tracking trends really means.
[03:34:21.433 --> 03:34:24.115]  And I mentioned about the jobs.
[03:34:24.115 --> 03:34:31.541]  Jobs that are being created because of the monopolies that run everything in Slavelandia, in a country near you.
[03:34:31.541 --> 03:34:34.583]  The merger and acquisition activity.
[03:34:34.583 --> 03:34:38.426]  They fire who they want and control what they want.
[03:34:38.426 --> 03:34:39.507]  Like when I was a young guy,
[03:34:40.009 --> 03:34:45.753]  They had things called stationary stores rather than Staples and Office Depot took over.
[03:34:45.753 --> 03:34:54.139]  And there were hardware stores before Lowe's and Home Depot took over.
[03:34:54.139 --> 03:35:05.847]  And there were mom and pop shops, clothing, women's shops, men's shops, shoe shops, one after another.
[03:35:05.847 --> 03:35:07.128]  Before the Macy's.
[03:35:08.447 --> 03:35:12.269]  The Targets and the Walmarts took over.
[03:35:12.269 --> 03:35:16.612]  So the jobs that are being created don't pay a lot of money.
[03:35:16.612 --> 03:35:22.216]  So this is from latest information out CNBC.
[03:35:22.216 --> 03:35:28.059]  So you know that, you know, they're not cooking it to make it sound bad.
[03:35:28.059 --> 03:35:30.441]  They're trying to make it sound better.
[03:35:30.441 --> 03:35:36.345]  The 10 jobs experiencing the fastest pay growth right now.
[03:35:36.345 --> 03:35:36.885]  Number one.
[03:35:37.301 --> 03:35:41.484]  A pharmacy technician.
[03:35:41.484 --> 03:35:42.344]  $31,000.
[03:35:42.344 --> 03:35:44.285]  Number two, a machine operator.
[03:35:44.285 --> 03:35:44.886]  Well, that's good.
[03:35:44.886 --> 03:35:44.946]  $40,000.
[03:35:44.946 --> 03:35:48.688]  But hey, guess what?
[03:35:48.688 --> 03:35:53.491]  Do you know how much manufacturing we do in the United States?
[03:35:53.491 --> 03:35:56.373]  Only 11% of our GDP.
[03:35:56.373 --> 03:36:03.077]  And that's why I support Trump 100% on bringing the jobs back and closing the borders.
[03:36:03.077 --> 03:36:04.338]  On other issues, I don't.
[03:36:04.338 --> 03:36:05.719]  Again, I'm a political atheist.
[03:36:06.420 --> 03:36:15.465]  I don't believe in people or clubs like the Democrats or the Repulsivekins.
[03:36:15.465 --> 03:36:18.787]  I look at issues for the way they are.
[03:36:18.787 --> 03:36:22.649]  So, I agree with him 100% on that.
[03:36:22.649 --> 03:36:25.430]  Don't like a lot of the foreign policy stuff.
[03:36:25.430 --> 03:36:31.013]  But anyway, that's one of your better jobs.
[03:36:31.013 --> 03:36:34.035]  Machine operator.
[03:36:34.035 --> 03:36:34.595]  Truck driver, $55,000.
[03:36:36.377 --> 03:36:38.078]  Cashier?
[03:36:38.078 --> 03:36:39.518]  Yeah, get a job at Walmart, 7-Eleven.
[03:36:39.518 --> 03:36:39.538]  $28,000.
[03:36:39.538 --> 03:36:40.338]  Bank teller, $32,000.
[03:36:40.338 --> 03:36:43.059]  Office manager, $48,000.
[03:36:43.059 --> 03:36:43.539]  Delivery driver, $41,000.
[03:36:43.539 --> 03:36:45.540]  Emergency medical technician, $35,000.
[03:36:45.540 --> 03:36:46.480]  Security officer, number 10, $35,000.
[03:36:46.480 --> 03:36:52.682]  You can't live in New York City on these kind of wages.
[03:37:05.680 --> 03:37:06.880]  You can't live in a lot of places.
[03:37:06.880 --> 03:37:22.204]  So when you look at the job numbers, they're okay, but the labor force participation rate is very high, and they don't count the people that are no longer looking for jobs.
[03:37:22.204 --> 03:37:25.985]  Now, front page in today's Wall Street Journal.
[03:37:25.985 --> 03:37:29.426]  Merger to create aerospace giant.
[03:37:29.426 --> 03:37:33.727]  United Technologies, Raytheon, the firm company valued at more than $100 billion.
[03:37:36.064 --> 03:37:41.046]  Again, there used to be laws in place that prohibited these mergers and acquisitions.
[03:37:41.046 --> 03:37:51.571]  When I was a young guy, there were no hedge funds or private equity groups, like the Blackstones or the Blackrocks or whoever they are, and buying up all this stuff.
[03:37:51.571 --> 03:37:54.893]  It was small businesses and corporations.
[03:37:54.893 --> 03:37:58.274]  Yeah, they were the big ones, but there was competition.
[03:37:58.274 --> 03:38:01.196]  This is from my book, Trends 2000.
[03:38:04.721 --> 03:38:04.841]  1996.
[03:38:04.841 --> 03:38:09.563]  It was a Warner book, a bestseller.
[03:38:09.563 --> 03:38:20.347]  And I'm talking about it because of this story about the merger of Lockheed, excuse me, of United Technologies and Raytheon.
[03:38:20.347 --> 03:38:23.248]  Because back then there was another merger.
[03:38:23.248 --> 03:38:25.089]  Layoff payoff.
[03:38:25.089 --> 03:38:29.791]  The Clinton administration has agreed to use 31 million dollars in taxpayer money
[03:38:30.629 --> 03:38:38.732]  To pay a third of the $92 million in bonuses that top officials of Martin Marietta Corp.
[03:38:38.732 --> 03:38:40.573]  and Lockheed Corp.
[03:38:40.573 --> 03:38:49.417]  granted themselves to staging the largest merger in Pentagon history.
[03:38:49.417 --> 03:38:51.577]  The government subsidized merger?
[03:38:51.577 --> 03:38:56.479]  The government subsidized, we, paying for this.
[03:38:56.479 --> 03:38:58.080]  Of Lockheed, Martin Marietta,
[03:38:59.540 --> 03:39:05.241]  Which will eliminate 30,000 jobs.
[03:39:05.241 --> 03:39:18.024]  Stockholders argued that the bonuses, including $8.2 million for Marietta Chairman Norman Augustine, were excessive and unwarranted.
[03:39:18.024 --> 03:39:28.887]  Defense Secretary William Perry and CIA Director John Deutch had bid consultants to Martin Marietta and was said to maintain close personal relationships
[03:39:29.670 --> 03:39:34.854]  With Augustine.
[03:39:34.854 --> 03:39:40.679]  All right?
[03:39:40.679 --> 03:39:46.164]  Nothing changes.
[03:39:46.164 --> 03:39:52.389]  Study released Friday says pay for chief executives at 23 major corporations rose 30% last year.
[03:39:52.389 --> 03:39:54.210]  Through the time
[03:39:58.246 --> 03:40:03.388]  Oh, though the firms laid off hundreds of thousands of workers since 1991.
[03:40:03.388 --> 03:40:07.710]  That was according to AP.
[03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:11.491]  So, that's what's going on with the job market.
[03:40:11.491 --> 03:40:13.372]  Now the economy.
[03:40:13.372 --> 03:40:17.113]  India, they cut their interest rates.
[03:40:17.113 --> 03:40:22.015]  Australia, cut their interest rates.
[03:40:22.015 --> 03:40:27.257]  Australia's economy slows to levels not seen since the great financial crisis.
[03:40:30.251 --> 03:40:37.117]  Fed considers July rate cut after sharp drop in jobs growth.
[03:40:37.117 --> 03:40:39.859]  How long have I been saying this?
[03:40:39.859 --> 03:40:43.902]  Since March in our Trend Alerts and Trends Journal.
[03:40:43.902 --> 03:40:52.089]  The Federal Reserve is going to cut interest rates at least four times before the 2020 election, if not more than then.
[03:40:52.089 --> 03:40:56.212]  Lackluster German exports take toll.
[03:40:56.212 --> 03:40:58.755]  This is all the current events forming future trends.
[03:41:00.310 --> 03:41:14.678]  Exports fell 3.7% last month and imports fell 1.3%.
[03:41:14.678 --> 03:41:18.180]  German industrial production fell nearly 2% in April.
[03:41:18.180 --> 03:41:25.705]  They're looking for growth in Germany at the grand total of 1.2%.
[03:41:25.705 --> 03:41:26.985]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:41:30.373 --> 03:41:33.376]  That's why you're seeing gold prices go up.
[03:41:33.376 --> 03:41:43.844]  Because interest rates are going down, and these digital currencies, printed on nothing and backed by nothing, are going to be printed more.
[03:41:43.844 --> 03:41:56.355]  But, although I say they're going to lower interest rates, and aggressively, investors are misplacing Fed's next move on rates, Goldman and UBS says.
[03:41:58.029 --> 03:42:00.431]  They warned that expectations for a series of U.S.
[03:42:00.431 --> 03:42:04.054]  interest rate cuts this year are overblown.
[03:42:04.054 --> 03:42:07.496]  Well, I say, they're blowing in the wrong direction.
[03:42:07.496 --> 03:42:10.098]  They're going to keep cutting interest rates.
[03:42:10.098 --> 03:42:18.465]  I said the 30-year mortgage that was about 5% in November of last year would be under 4% this year.
[03:42:18.465 --> 03:42:19.566]  Guess what?
[03:42:19.566 --> 03:42:22.668]  It hit it last week, 399.
[03:42:22.668 --> 03:42:27.392]  So, as you're looking to the future, consider what's going on in the present.
[03:42:28.410 --> 03:42:31.991]  Look at the current events forming future trends.
[03:42:31.991 --> 03:42:34.852]  They're in front of you, but you're not getting it from the mainstream media.
[03:42:34.852 --> 03:42:39.834]  And that's why you tune in to InfoWars and subscribe to the New Trends Journal.
[03:42:39.834 --> 03:42:41.755]  You get history before it happens.
[03:42:41.755 --> 03:42:45.816]  They're talking about the Mueller Report and a bunch of other garbage.
[03:42:45.816 --> 03:42:47.617]  So we're going to be back in a little bit.
[03:42:47.617 --> 03:42:50.198]  And remember, stay healthy.
[03:42:53.787 --> 03:42:57.932]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:42:57.932 --> 03:43:08.323]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[03:43:08.323 --> 03:43:11.467]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[03:43:11.647 --> 03:43:12.047]  I don't know.
[03:43:27.774 --> 03:43:36.936]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate-driven model.
[03:43:36.936 --> 03:43:45.538]  And the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:45.538 --> 03:43:48.839]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment.
[03:43:48.839 --> 03:43:52.220]  And it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:55.281 --> 03:43:58.981]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:43:59.918 --> 03:44:01.679]  We have a new super special.
[03:44:01.679 --> 03:44:04.260]  It's on everything with Force in its name.
[03:44:04.260 --> 03:44:09.702]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[03:44:09.702 --> 03:44:10.722]  It's gonna be a hit shirt now.
[03:44:10.722 --> 03:44:11.323]  Hope you get it.
[03:44:11.323 --> 03:44:12.103]  Sports broadcast.
[03:44:12.103 --> 03:44:12.563]  Spreads the word.
[03:44:12.563 --> 03:44:13.864]  It's a great conversation piece.
[03:44:13.864 --> 03:44:14.944]  It's 33% off.
[03:44:14.944 --> 03:44:17.165]  If we sold the t-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[03:44:17.165 --> 03:44:19.966]  All the other Force products, it's all 50% off.
[03:44:19.966 --> 03:44:22.547]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[03:44:22.547 --> 03:44:25.048]  That is the best CoQ10, PQQ system.
[03:44:25.048 --> 03:44:26.509]  It's just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[03:44:26.509 --> 03:44:26.649]  50% off.
[03:44:27.829 --> 03:44:29.231]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[03:44:29.231 --> 03:44:30.632]  RainForce Plus, amazing.
[03:44:30.632 --> 03:44:33.074]  TurboForce, which is just tearing our energy.
[03:44:33.074 --> 03:44:34.955]  Clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[03:44:34.955 --> 03:44:36.957]  Ultimate FemaleForce is incredible as well.
[03:44:36.957 --> 03:44:38.918]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[03:44:38.918 --> 03:44:41.721]  All of the Force products, it's got Force in the name.

[03:45:54.192 --> 03:45:58.398]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[03:45:58.398 --> 03:45:59.459]  They are technocrats.
[03:45:59.459 --> 03:46:01.742]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[03:46:01.742 --> 03:46:08.631]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[03:46:09.192 --> 03:46:10.974]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[03:46:10.974 --> 03:46:13.416]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[03:46:13.416 --> 03:46:19.941]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[03:46:19.941 --> 03:46:25.126]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.

[03:47:15.922 --> 03:47:19.284]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:19.284 --> 03:47:24.866]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:47:24.866 --> 03:47:28.648]  Hey, great being here, great being here on The Alex Jones Show.

[03:47:46.804 --> 03:47:47.805]  50% off!
[03:47:47.805 --> 03:47:48.365]  That's right.

[03:47:52.449 --> 03:48:00.796]  When it comes to creating a supplement routine, it can be harder than ever to find what you need from the start.
[03:48:00.796 --> 03:48:10.664]  With deep supplement knowledge, stacks of bottles, and complicated routines, knowing where to begin can be a mess.
[03:48:10.664 --> 03:48:14.587]  That's why InfoWars created the 8-pack
[03:48:14.946 --> 03:48:16.727]  Power Stack.
[03:48:16.727 --> 03:48:18.287]  So, check it out.
[03:48:18.287 --> 03:48:20.268]  Go to InfoWars.
[03:48:20.268 --> 03:48:22.869]  And I love that super male vitality.
[03:48:22.869 --> 03:48:24.630]  Woof!
[03:48:24.630 --> 03:48:28.972]  Gives me that boogie feeling to get rockin' and rollin'.
[03:48:28.972 --> 03:48:33.354]  You gotta boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is iffy.
[03:48:33.354 --> 03:48:38.916]  So, I wanted to talk about what's going on in the world.
[03:48:38.916 --> 03:48:41.157]  Because most of American media doesn't.
[03:48:44.608 --> 03:48:47.950]  Thousands march in Haiti to demand President's resignation.
[03:48:47.950 --> 03:48:53.712]  This is just the last two days.
[03:48:53.712 --> 03:48:58.354]  Hong Kong brought to standstill by mass protests against extradition bill.
[03:48:58.354 --> 03:49:02.656]  Millions of people took to the streets over the weekend.
[03:49:02.656 --> 03:49:07.418]  Venezuela exodus surpasses four million according to the UN.
[03:49:07.418 --> 03:49:12.821]  Yeah, thanks to those sanctions that the United States has been putting on it, it hasn't helped things.
[03:49:12.821 --> 03:49:13.321]  Sudan.
[03:49:14.307 --> 03:49:18.450]  Several killed on first day of civil disobedience.
[03:49:18.450 --> 03:49:20.191]  And they killed 108 last week.
[03:49:20.191 --> 03:49:21.011]  Hey!
[03:49:21.011 --> 03:49:22.932]  How come that's not in the news?
[03:49:22.932 --> 03:49:27.775]  Eh, it's okay to kill them, but... Hey, we gotta watch out what's going down here in Venezuela.
[03:49:27.775 --> 03:49:30.757]  Hey, we gotta get rid of that guy Qaddafi, I tells ya!
[03:49:30.757 --> 03:49:33.319]  Yeah, the Nobel piece-of-crap prize winner, Obama.
[03:49:33.319 --> 03:49:35.580]  Remember that one?
[03:49:35.580 --> 03:49:37.921]  He wasn't slaughtering people like they are in Sudan.
[03:49:37.921 --> 03:49:39.222]  Hey, but that's different.
[03:49:39.222 --> 03:49:40.023]  What about Yemen?
[03:49:40.023 --> 03:49:41.203]  Who cares?
[03:49:41.203 --> 03:49:42.664]  What's a Yemen?
[03:49:42.664 --> 03:49:43.925]  Most Americans don't even know it.
[03:49:44.807 --> 03:49:46.588]  What's a Yemen?
[03:49:46.588 --> 03:49:48.070]  Let alone though it's a country.
[03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:51.272]  Worst humanitarian crisis on earth.
[03:49:51.272 --> 03:49:58.598]  Kazakhstan police and protesters clash after poll.
[03:49:58.598 --> 03:50:00.520]  Yep.
[03:50:00.520 --> 03:50:02.741]  The new president's on course.
[03:50:02.741 --> 03:50:09.607]  The first new president in 30 years but some opposition groups say the vote was unfair and should be boycotted.
[03:50:11.187 --> 03:50:15.851]  Moldova crisis deepens as new president calls snap election.
[03:50:15.851 --> 03:50:20.875]  Again, remember, this is like two days.
[03:50:20.875 --> 03:50:30.644]  After protests in Albania, president cancels election.
[03:50:30.644 --> 03:50:37.510]  Yep, 500 protesters in Kazakhstan election are detained.
[03:50:37.510 --> 03:50:37.650]  And,
[03:50:39.737 --> 03:50:45.940]  Europe reacts with dismay at prospect of reckless Johnson in number 10.
[03:50:45.940 --> 03:50:55.345]  When Britain voted to leave the EU, Frank-Walter Stenmaier, Germany's then-Foreign Minister, made it clear who he thought was to blame.
[03:50:55.345 --> 03:51:05.010]  Irresponsible politicians lured the country into Brexit and then went off and played cricket.
[03:51:05.010 --> 03:51:08.372]  And that was a clear reference to Boris Johnson, the man
[03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:13.790]  It was the face of the leave campaign.
[03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:14.970]  Boris Johnson.
[03:51:14.970 --> 03:51:16.051]  People voted to leave.
[03:51:16.051 --> 03:51:19.212]  Why don't you mind your own business, Germany?
[03:51:19.212 --> 03:51:21.832]  But anyway, you can see what's going on.
[03:51:21.832 --> 03:51:32.295]  Moldovan court orders president, or excuse me, Moldovan court ousts president and appoints replacement, adding to instability.
[03:51:33.277 --> 03:51:36.119]  And I didn't mention what's going on in Somalia.
[03:51:36.119 --> 03:51:37.720]  How about Algeria?
[03:51:37.720 --> 03:51:41.023]  That's only been going on for 16 weeks.
[03:51:41.023 --> 03:51:43.945]  And then again, what else is going on over there?
[03:51:43.945 --> 03:51:45.146]  Ah, South Africa.
[03:51:45.146 --> 03:51:46.807]  Everybody's happy over there.
[03:51:46.807 --> 03:51:48.188]  Oh, Brazil.
[03:51:48.188 --> 03:51:51.531]  I forgot Brazil, but back into recession.
[03:51:51.531 --> 03:51:53.652]  What about Argentina?
[03:51:53.652 --> 03:51:57.095]  I only have a interest rate.
[03:51:57.095 --> 03:51:58.296]  You want to borrow some dough?
[03:51:58.296 --> 03:52:00.617]  It's only about 65% peso.
[03:52:00.617 --> 03:52:02.619]  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.
[03:52:03.450 --> 03:52:04.150]  Down over 50%.
[03:52:04.150 --> 03:52:06.331]  Oh, Mexico!
[03:52:06.331 --> 03:52:09.772]  Yep, showing recessionary numbers.
[03:52:09.772 --> 03:52:11.373]  You got it.
[03:52:11.373 --> 03:52:15.415]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:52:15.415 --> 03:52:22.477]  I'm putting the pieces together here because two factors write off and many more beneath it.
[03:52:22.477 --> 03:52:25.979]  Number one.
[03:52:25.979 --> 03:52:26.579]  Top trends for 2019.
[03:52:26.579 --> 03:52:26.819]  Human waves.
[03:52:30.219 --> 03:52:33.982]  Oh yeah, four million left Venezuela in the last two years?
[03:52:33.982 --> 03:52:36.864]  You think you're going to stay in El Salvador?
[03:52:36.864 --> 03:52:45.270]  Oh yeah, you want to hang around any of these countries I read to you about?
[03:52:45.270 --> 03:52:48.692]  Kazakhstan?
[03:52:48.692 --> 03:52:55.016]  You want to hang around in Haiti?
[03:52:55.016 --> 03:52:57.338]  Oh, here's a good one.
[03:52:57.338 --> 03:52:58.679]  And the band rolls on.
[03:52:59.759 --> 03:53:05.040]  Rocker, comedian, actor, and vlogger run for parliament in Ukraine.
[03:53:05.040 --> 03:53:07.821]  Yeah, they already elected a comedian.
[03:53:07.821 --> 03:53:10.821]  And he blew out Poroshenko, the United States puppet.
[03:53:10.821 --> 03:53:13.782]  He got like 76% of the vote.
[03:53:13.782 --> 03:53:20.403]  And then when you look at the Democrats and Repulsifkins in this country, it's a comic show anyway, so it's no different anywhere.
[03:53:20.403 --> 03:53:22.884]  They just got the different labels.
[03:53:22.884 --> 03:53:26.104]  Again, Hong Kong protesters.
[03:53:26.104 --> 03:53:27.085]  One after another.
[03:53:27.085 --> 03:53:28.225]  Albania.
[03:53:28.225 --> 03:53:28.725]  Sudan.
[03:53:30.620 --> 03:53:34.783]  So, number one, human waves.
[03:53:34.783 --> 03:53:48.993]  Remember when Gaddafi was in as the head of Libya, the richest country in Africa, gave the people more freedom than any of them, and has the sweetest, sweet crude around.
[03:53:48.993 --> 03:53:52.175]  I wonder why that's?
[03:53:52.175 --> 03:53:53.956]  No, it was their broccoli crop they wanted.
[03:53:53.956 --> 03:53:55.418]  That's why they went in there, America.
[03:53:56.983 --> 03:54:03.228]  He warned Europe that you will have a wave of migrants coming out of Africa into Europe if you get rid of me.
[03:54:03.228 --> 03:54:08.333]  They got rid of them and they've been coming in and haven't stopped.
[03:54:08.333 --> 03:54:11.155]  Number two is a global slowdown.
[03:54:11.155 --> 03:54:14.658]  That's why you see this.
[03:54:14.658 --> 03:54:17.460]  This is real.
[03:54:17.460 --> 03:54:20.743]  The jobs I showed you, they're not paying money.
[03:54:20.743 --> 03:54:25.087]  The more cheap labor that comes in, the lower the pay of the job.
[03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:29.753]  Supply and demand.
[03:54:29.753 --> 03:54:36.078]  They're going to lower interest rates and more quantitative easing around the world.
[03:54:36.078 --> 03:54:42.163]  You see the Chinese Yuan going down now.
[03:54:42.163 --> 03:54:46.207]  It has nothing to do with them purposely lowering it.
[03:54:46.207 --> 03:54:51.211]  It's going down because they're pumping more cheap dough into their economy and trying to prop it up.
[03:54:53.334 --> 03:54:57.036]  Exports were up, imports were down in China.
[03:54:57.036 --> 03:55:00.058]  Imports are very important to them.
[03:55:00.058 --> 03:55:06.622]  Because some 80% of their GDP is consumer-based.
[03:55:06.622 --> 03:55:09.684]  Here it's about two-thirds.
[03:55:09.684 --> 03:55:11.145]  So they're not bringing the stuff in.
[03:55:11.145 --> 03:55:13.307]  So they're printing all this money.
[03:55:13.307 --> 03:55:15.788]  Coming up with new schemes.
[03:55:15.788 --> 03:55:19.991]  Lowering reserve ratio requirements.
[03:55:19.991 --> 03:55:21.652]  So the banks can loan out more money.
[03:55:22.878 --> 03:55:26.339]  I'm reading all these countries.
[03:55:26.339 --> 03:55:30.500]  What would I read before about India, Germany, Australia?
[03:55:30.500 --> 03:55:34.681]  There's a global slowdown.
[03:55:34.681 --> 03:55:38.862]  So they're going to keep devaluing their currencies.
[03:55:38.862 --> 03:55:43.363]  My forecast for gold, I do not give financial advice.
[03:55:43.363 --> 03:55:47.804]  Gold has to break over $13.85 to gain strength.
[03:55:47.804 --> 03:55:49.425]  Now it's around, as we're speaking, about $13.30.
[03:55:51.454 --> 03:55:53.316]  Once it breaks past $13.85, it has to hit $1,450 per ounce.
[03:55:53.316 --> 03:55:56.418]  When it breaks that number and steadies over that, $14.50, $14.80, $14.40, $14.60, $14.70, poof!
[03:55:56.418 --> 03:55:59.621]  I forecast it's going to spike to $2,000 an ounce.
[03:56:17.518 --> 03:56:28.185]  All these global economies, you heard Mario Draghi, the ECB chairman, former Goldman Sachs guy, that ran their European division, now head of the European Central Bank.
[03:56:28.185 --> 03:56:35.470]  Last week they're going to use all the tools in the toolbox they can to prop up the markets.
[03:56:35.470 --> 03:56:40.053]  Toolbox, full box, BS box, that's right.
[03:56:40.712 --> 03:56:48.196]  A box of garbage, a box of worthless money, a box of quantitative easing.
[03:56:48.196 --> 03:56:50.778]  Who made up this crap?
[03:56:50.778 --> 03:57:00.124]  They didn't teach you quantitative easing, zero negative interest rates like they have now in negative interest rates over there in Europe.
[03:57:00.124 --> 03:57:05.947]  So their toolbox is running empty and it's only a matter of time before that
[03:57:07.006 --> 03:57:15.152]  $250 trillion debt bubble that's now near $300 trillion and growing is going to explode.
[03:57:15.152 --> 03:57:20.316]  So again, follow the current events that are forming future trends.

[03:58:47.929 --> 03:58:49.690]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:58:49.690 --> 03:59:00.978]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:59:01.738 --> 03:59:10.527]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:59:10.527 --> 03:59:16.714]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[03:59:16.714 --> 03:59:21.999]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:59:21.999 --> 03:59:24.242]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:59:24.602 --> 03:59:26.323]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:59:26.323 --> 03:59:36.308]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:59:36.308 --> 03:59:38.969]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:59:38.969 --> 03:59:47.233]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:59:47.233 --> 03:59:49.875]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
