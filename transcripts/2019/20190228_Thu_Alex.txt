[00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:24.925]  Well, was yesterday fun or what?
[00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:29.390]  Tough to top a broadcast like yesterday.
[00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.894]  But we're here anyway on this Thursday, February 28th, 2019.
[00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:41.461]  And Owens-Royer filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:43.884]  We will be hearing from Alex today.
[00:00:45.538 --> 00:00:57.127]  And he will be obviously responding to the viral podcast that was the Joe Rogan experience yesterday, as well as some other breaking news.
[00:00:57.127 --> 00:01:05.773]  But you know, it's pretty amazing that yesterday you had, let me just go through it.
[00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.013]  The Trump-Kim summit in Vietnam.
[00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:17.538]  You had Pakistan and India almost on the verge of full-out war.
[00:01:17.538 --> 00:01:22.843]  You had the Michael Cohen testimony circus.
[00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:29.368]  And in the middle of all that, what was the number one story on social media?
[00:01:29.368 --> 00:01:32.791]  What was the number one trend on social media?
[00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.153]  What had everybody watching it by the end of the day?
[00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:42.439]  Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan experience.
[00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:50.523]  It's already up to 3 million views, and that's just on the one YouTube page for Joe Rogan.
[00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:52.144]  Does Joe Rogan have Facebook or Twitter?
[00:01:52.144 --> 00:02:02.430]  I don't know, but you also take into account all of the clips that were put on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and everywhere.
[00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.152]  It's already probably got 10 million views.
[00:02:06.345 --> 00:02:15.188]  But the full original on the YouTube, Joe Rogan Experience, is about to hit 3 million views by the end of this broadcast.
[00:02:15.188 --> 00:02:19.830]  And they were live for 5 hours.
[00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.331]  And Alex Jones was classic Alex Jones.
[00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:40.350]  And I don't even know what the takeaway from the fact that Alex Jones was trending above the Trump-Kim summit, almost a full-out war between India and Pakistan, and the Michael Cohen hearing.
[00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.931]  I really don't know what to take away from that.
[00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:47.193]  I think there's a couple things to take away from that.
[00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:52.875]  But isn't it, isn't the real story how it just showed?
[00:02:55.345 --> 00:03:11.034]  If you're watching right now, we just have the video of Alex just, I mean, literally pumping his arms up and down for three straight minutes, flailing about as he's standing up for the unborn.
[00:03:11.034 --> 00:03:12.795]  Pretty incredible stuff.
[00:03:12.795 --> 00:03:24.421]  And it was, I mean, Joe apparently had never heard of this new legislation the Democrats passed where if a baby's born and it's alive, well, you just let it die.
[00:03:26.434 --> 00:03:30.136]  You don't give it treatment.
[00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:32.097]  Really sick stuff.
[00:03:32.097 --> 00:03:34.599]  Isn't that against the oath that doctors take?
[00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:54.331]  I mean, I'm already getting off on a jag, but they banned Alex Jones on all the social media platforms, yet I think that you could make the case that he's probably top three on social media, and doesn't
[00:03:55.245 --> 00:04:02.989]  The fact that he was trending yesterday above all of the other stuff that was breaking, doesn't that prove it?
[00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:14.955]  So it just shows you how committed these people are to censoring free speech and from stopping you
[00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:19.363]  From deciding for yourself.
[00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:22.024]  Stopping you from making up your own mind.
[00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:28.787]  Stopping you from getting the coverage that you want.
[00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:34.829]  So, I just thought that that was amazing.
[00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:42.852]  And of course, there is news breaking right now when it comes to the censorship that Facebook is engaged in.
[00:04:42.852 --> 00:04:45.133]  We had James O'Keefe on yesterday.
[00:04:45.133 --> 00:04:46.694]  We've got more video we're gonna air today.
[00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.891]  Is free speech dead in America, folks?
[00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:55.653]  Well, if they can censor Alex Jones, then the answer is yes.
[00:04:55.653 --> 00:04:58.295]  But this is the Alex Jones Show, and we'll be right back.
[00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:18.648]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:28.712]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:05:28.712 --> 00:05:37.255]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:05:38.075 --> 00:05:39.436]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:40.596]  You must experience it.
[00:05:40.596 --> 00:05:42.557]  It is a total game changer.
[00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:47.580]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.121]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[00:05:49.121 --> 00:05:50.582]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:57.285]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:05:57.285 --> 00:05:58.766]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.
[00:06:06.181 --> 00:06:08.083]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:14.888]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:14.888 --> 00:06:19.231]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:19.231 --> 00:06:22.794]  The stories on InfoWars.com.
[00:06:22.794 --> 00:06:25.396]  Ratings, Alex Jones Podcast.
[00:06:25.396 --> 00:06:29.919]  More popular than Cohen Hearing.
[00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.741]  This is why they want Alex Jones censored and banned.
[00:06:33.937 --> 00:06:43.162]  But strike me down now, and I shall become more powerful than you ever imagined.
[00:06:43.162 --> 00:06:47.225]  There is one thing I'm wondering.
[00:06:47.225 --> 00:06:53.628]  Why is Joe Rogan allowed to have Alex Jones on his podcast?
[00:06:53.628 --> 00:06:57.030]  And why didn't YouTube censor it?
[00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.392]  Does this mean Alex Jones is allowed back on YouTube?
[00:07:00.202 --> 00:07:02.584]  Does this mean Joe has exclusive privilege?
[00:07:02.584 --> 00:07:08.648]  Does this mean they're just going to turn their head the other way?
[00:07:08.648 --> 00:07:15.013]  But yes, Alex was on the Joe Rogan experience yesterday and it was the number one trend on social media.
[00:07:15.013 --> 00:07:18.076]  Bigger than almost all-out war between Pakistan and India.
[00:07:18.076 --> 00:07:24.400]  Bigger than the circus that was all hyped up and had the spotlight on it, the Michael Cohen testimony.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.584]  Bigger than the Trump-Kim summit was Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan experience.
[00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:48.304]  We highlight that because as they're trying to condense us and censor us, it's just nice to kind of get to stick your head out of the ground for once and look around and realize, wow, everybody's been looking for me.
[00:07:48.304 --> 00:07:52.167]  And so it's like, oh my gosh, Alex Jones is back on YouTube.
[00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:53.008]  Everybody tunes in.
[00:07:55.174 --> 00:08:05.157]  It peaked at two, I think it was like 206,000 live audience with zero promotion.
[00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:07.138]  Zero.
[00:08:07.138 --> 00:08:09.139]  We didn't promote it.
[00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:10.019]  Rogan didn't promote it.
[00:08:10.019 --> 00:08:12.940]  There were no graphics sent out.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.200]  There was no announcement made.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.061]  It was just fired up.
[00:08:16.061 --> 00:08:19.362]  Alex Jones, quarter million people tune in live.
[00:08:23.168 --> 00:08:28.850]  Now we'll see where this one ranks when it's all said and done.
[00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.631]  I went and checked last night.
[00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:44.275]  The Alex Jones, Joe Rogan Experience number 911 was number three on Rogan's channel.
[00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:48.337]  So we'll see where this one ends up when it's all said and done.
[00:08:49.255 --> 00:08:51.216]  Now this is just the YouTube channel we're talking about.
[00:08:51.216 --> 00:09:03.283]  We're not talking about all the people that add clips to Twitter and Facebook and their own YouTube channels or all the other places where the Rogan Podcast is distributed.
[00:09:03.283 --> 00:09:05.004]  I believe it's on iTunes.
[00:09:05.004 --> 00:09:14.670]  So, will iTunes ban that podcast because Alex Jones is on it?
[00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.131]  Very interesting stuff.
[00:09:18.772 --> 00:09:29.578]  It's weird that Alex is so popular and he has everybody talking about him, yet he's able to just be totally erased off of the social media accounts.
[00:09:29.578 --> 00:09:33.640]  How do they get away with that?
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.941]  So, we will be getting into some of that news.
[00:09:38.134 --> 00:09:42.978]  There's other stuff that I haven't been able to get to that I'm going to be able to get to today because we don't have many guests.
[00:09:42.978 --> 00:09:51.044]  We do have Jacob Wool coming on at 1130 Central here in 20 minutes.
[00:09:51.044 --> 00:09:53.886]  And he is having a press conference this afternoon.
[00:09:56.038 --> 00:10:01.523]  He was in Minnesota with a team and Ali Alexander investigating Ilhan Omar.
[00:10:01.523 --> 00:10:02.524]  They're now in D.C.
[00:10:02.524 --> 00:10:03.866]  with the team.
[00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:15.597]  They're going to have a press conference today announcing what they've discovered with Jack Berkman in their investigation into Ilhan Omar.
[00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:30.287]  Jacob Wool will be joining us live to let us know where you can find that live stream and what exactly it is they were investigating.
[00:10:30.287 --> 00:10:42.034]  It could go many ways, but my guess is it's the documents of her marrying her brother.
[00:10:42.034 --> 00:10:43.015]  That's just my guess.
[00:10:43.015 --> 00:10:45.216]  That's not a tip or an inside information.
[00:10:45.216 --> 00:10:46.457]  That's just my guess.
[00:10:48.942 --> 00:11:06.830]  Matt Bracken is going to host the fourth hour, and then I may just play the whole Project Veritas video of the Facebook employee, former employee, talking about how they de-boost conservatives.
[00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.651]  Well, me, they just erase.
[00:11:08.651 --> 00:11:09.871]  Alex Jones, they just erase.
[00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:12.893]  InfoWars, they just erase.
[00:11:12.893 --> 00:11:14.834]  I'm honored.
[00:11:14.834 --> 00:11:15.614]  Thank you, Facebook.
[00:11:19.355 --> 00:11:29.146]  And I've been telling people about this for a long time, but people are finally starting to do the deep research into it for themselves.
[00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:38.637]  And so you're going to find out what I have told you dozens of times here at InfoWars, whenever CNN or MSNBC
[00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:41.645]  I don't know Fox News.
[00:11:41.645 --> 00:11:46.067]  I've never seen any proof of it, but I know they do it in MSNBC and CNN.
[00:11:46.067 --> 00:11:51.989]  Whenever they have a town hall, the audience that you're seeing, it's not all hand-picked.
[00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:54.990]  I mean, they do have some people that get in there, and they do have people from different sides.
[00:11:54.990 --> 00:12:00.312]  But they hand-pick at least four people every time and give them a script.
[00:12:00.312 --> 00:12:02.513]  And they're always right out of the Democrat Party.
[00:12:04.594 --> 00:12:07.723]  And so finally, people are starting to catch on to this.
[00:12:07.723 --> 00:12:11.733]  And because of social media, you can actually go find these people.
[00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:12.716]  And so guess what?
[00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:17.215]  They went and did research in the Bernie Sanders Town Hall.
[00:12:17.215 --> 00:12:19.057]  This graphic is bad, guys.
[00:12:19.057 --> 00:12:19.637]  I'm sorry.
[00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:25.342]  I should have forwarded you the tweet with all these images so that you could pull it up, so that's my fault.
[00:12:25.342 --> 00:12:29.786]  If you just search Bernie Sanders Town Hall, like Democrat implants or something, I'm sure you can find it.
[00:12:29.786 --> 00:12:38.594]  It turns out that almost every person at the Town Hall featuring Bernie Sanders was a Democrat operative.
[00:12:42.896 --> 00:12:47.619]  Amazing and they just take the they just oh, okay.
[00:12:47.619 --> 00:13:01.869]  Here's this person and I don't know how these people do it It's like I mean The Kekistan troll army on reddit and 4chan like has mystical powers or something or access to something I've never seen or heard of because
[00:13:02.955 --> 00:13:06.778]  They find these people like in no time.
[00:13:06.778 --> 00:13:08.179]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:09.200]  Boom!
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.183]  Every single one of them a Democrat operative.
[00:13:13.183 --> 00:13:16.965]  CNN does this every damn time.
[00:13:16.965 --> 00:13:20.848]  CNN is the definition of fake news.
[00:13:20.848 --> 00:13:25.312]  I mean, these people suck!
[00:13:25.312 --> 00:13:26.893]  All they want to do is deceive you.
[00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:28.254]  That's all they want to do!
[00:13:28.254 --> 00:13:31.936]  I can't even...
[00:13:36.078 --> 00:13:46.742]  It just, it's, I just wish people understood the levels, the lengths that CNN goes to to deceive the public.
[00:13:46.742 --> 00:13:52.184]  It's unbelievable!
[00:13:52.184 --> 00:13:55.165]  So, pull up the graphic again guys and just go through it.
[00:13:55.165 --> 00:13:59.347]  I mean, because this, this wakes, this shocks people.
[00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:03.527]  Because, oh, you know, oh, you're watching the town hall.
[00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:08.169]  These are just regular Americans, just like you and I. They don't have an agenda.
[00:14:08.169 --> 00:14:09.209]  They don't have a script.
[00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:10.049]  No, they do.
[00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:14.791]  They literally do.
[00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:15.731]  And so think about it.
[00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:16.932]  If you're the producers at CNN,
[00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:23.015]  And you're about to have a town hall, and you're calling up all your Democrat operatives.
[00:14:23.015 --> 00:14:23.876]  Hey, we got a town hall.
[00:14:23.876 --> 00:14:24.836]  I need you to ask this.
[00:14:24.836 --> 00:14:25.617]  Hey, we got a town hall.
[00:14:25.617 --> 00:14:26.718]  I need you to ask this.
[00:14:26.718 --> 00:14:28.760]  Totally contrived.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.083]  Totally manufactured.
[00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:32.704]  Nothing real.
[00:14:32.704 --> 00:14:36.388]  Nothing organic.
[00:14:36.388 --> 00:14:38.090]  And then I gotta give Bernie Sanders credit.
[00:14:39.195 --> 00:14:42.157]  He did not win the nomination in 2016.
[00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:43.358]  He was never going to win it.
[00:14:43.358 --> 00:14:45.819]  Whether he realizes that or not, I don't know.
[00:14:45.819 --> 00:14:49.802]  I can't tell how dumb or dumb or smart the guy is.
[00:14:49.802 --> 00:14:50.882]  But I do give him credit.
[00:14:50.882 --> 00:14:53.804]  He got a haircut and he found a comb.
[00:14:53.804 --> 00:14:55.125]  It was tough.
[00:14:55.125 --> 00:14:58.347]  But I guess that means Bernie's serious this time around.
[00:14:58.347 --> 00:15:00.408]  Last time he was just joking.
[00:15:00.408 --> 00:15:07.072]  Last time he was just in it to make a couple million bucks for himself, get a new summer home, get a new sports car.
[00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.033]  But this year,
[00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:11.307]  This year.
[00:15:11.307 --> 00:15:12.428]  Yeah.
[00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:15.490]  Bernie got the haircut.
[00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.011]  He got the comb.
[00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:20.093]  And he's even buttoning up his jacket.
[00:15:20.093 --> 00:15:24.836]  So maybe Bernie Sanders is actually running to win this time.
[00:15:24.836 --> 00:15:26.537]  Boy, wouldn't that be fun.
[00:15:26.537 --> 00:15:28.358]  Socialism versus capitalism.
[00:15:28.358 --> 00:15:28.378]  2020.
[00:15:28.378 --> 00:15:28.938]  Yeah.
[00:15:35.655 --> 00:15:37.797]  That's a tough one right there.
[00:15:37.797 --> 00:15:39.198]  Socialism or capitalism, folks?
[00:15:39.198 --> 00:15:43.602]  Which one do you want?
[00:15:43.602 --> 00:15:44.743]  Wow.
[00:15:44.743 --> 00:15:53.411]  But don't worry, because CNN will stack their town hall full of operatives to rig the whole thing and then make you think it's real.
[00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.433]  Because that's what CNN does.
[00:15:55.433 --> 00:15:56.934]  Total fake news.
[00:15:56.934 --> 00:15:57.575]  We'll be right back.

[00:17:29.155 --> 00:17:35.396]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:35.396 --> 00:17:38.437]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:38.437 --> 00:17:44.358]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:44.358 --> 00:17:48.138]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:48.138 --> 00:17:49.418]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:49.418 --> 00:17:50.759]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:56.960]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[00:20:02.842 --> 00:20:06.084]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:06.084 --> 00:20:15.349]  How does the sand go?
[00:20:15.349 --> 00:20:16.870]  You miss the forest through the trees?
[00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:39.569]  It's not even that as much as sometimes you just miss the elephant in the room somehow.
[00:20:39.569 --> 00:20:49.811]  Or like... Or like you're moving so fast, speeding down the highway, and you miss the monument that you were waiting to see for an hour.
[00:20:49.811 --> 00:20:56.753]  And you're like, oh, where... Oh, I was just driving down Highway 70, where was that, where was the arch?
[00:20:56.753 --> 00:20:57.133]  Like, what?
[00:20:57.133 --> 00:20:58.373]  We just passed the arch.
[00:20:58.373 --> 00:21:01.034]  What?
[00:21:01.034 --> 00:21:01.114]  And...
[00:21:03.058 --> 00:21:05.340]  I realized.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:11.705]  So Jacob Wohl is going to be joining us in the next segment to make an announcement.
[00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:13.666]  He's hosting a press conference later this afternoon.
[00:21:13.666 --> 00:21:16.148]  He's going to talk to us about that.
[00:21:16.148 --> 00:21:21.712]  And they went and they investigated Ilhan Omar and it just hit me.
[00:21:21.712 --> 00:21:29.058]  The reason why they just banned Jacob Wohl is because he's about to out Ilhan Omar.
[00:21:29.058 --> 00:21:29.979]  And so sometimes
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.962]  The answers are a lot simpler than we think.
[00:21:34.962 --> 00:21:39.584]  Because what are the two things right now on social media that will get you banned?
[00:21:39.584 --> 00:21:42.626]  Well, there's really, we'll say the three main things.
[00:21:42.626 --> 00:21:56.673]  Using the phrase illegal immigration, or talking about illegal immigration, talking anything negative about Islam, and then using the word trans, or insulting trans, in their view.
[00:21:56.673 --> 00:21:59.054]  Those are the three hot buttons right now.
[00:22:00.717 --> 00:22:15.868]  So Jacob Wohl is going to investigate Ilhan Omar potentially marrying her brother illegally for a green card and they ban him on Twitter right before that.
[00:22:15.868 --> 00:22:21.472]  He wasn't doing anything different than he ever does, but see, they know.
[00:22:21.472 --> 00:22:29.918]  Folks, these, you know, it's like I have to tell people sometimes because they send me some personal stuff on Twitter messages and I'm like,
[00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:34.151]  Realize we're not the only people reading these messages.
[00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:37.152]  So, you know, be careful.
[00:22:37.152 --> 00:22:48.294]  And you know that Twitter also has access to your camera, your data, your contacts, your location.
[00:22:48.294 --> 00:22:49.555]  Oh, yeah.
[00:22:49.555 --> 00:22:51.255]  Oh, they all do.
[00:22:51.255 --> 00:22:53.616]  Go ahead and read the terms of service.
[00:22:56.254 --> 00:23:08.620]  But I'm getting off track, it's just because I just realized, it's like, they banned, we all know that they banned Alex Jones because he was the big focal point, InfoWars was a big focal point, we can change the narrative, and so they had to ban him.
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.961]  Too popular, too powerful, ban him.
[00:23:11.961 --> 00:23:21.966]  Then, I was kind of still allowed to exist with The War Room, and then after we had all the exclusive Roger Stone coverage, they banned The War Room.
[00:23:21.966 --> 00:23:24.527]  Because you see, that's not allowed to get out.
[00:23:25.976 --> 00:23:29.200]  It's the same thing happening to Jacob.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.363]  He's investigating Ilhan Omar.
[00:23:32.363 --> 00:23:37.129]  For whatever reason, social media protects Muslims in this country.
[00:23:39.278 --> 00:23:40.318]  Actively.
[00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:43.980]  Or at least as far as content on social media is concerned.
[00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.500]  So, that might be the big reason.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:56.624]  Now we'll find out from Jacob if he A. agrees with that or B. does have bombshell revelations coming this afternoon during the press conference.
[00:23:56.624 --> 00:24:06.907]  Now look, in the middle of all this censorship we're forced to contract to the point that now it's just Infowars.com slash show.
[00:24:08.553 --> 00:24:11.175]  Yes, we exist on some other platforms out there.
[00:24:11.175 --> 00:24:11.876]  I mean, it's great.
[00:24:11.876 --> 00:24:12.956]  Brideon is out there.
[00:24:12.956 --> 00:24:13.457]  It's great.
[00:24:13.457 --> 00:24:14.437]  BitChute is out there.
[00:24:14.437 --> 00:24:14.738]  It's great.
[00:24:14.738 --> 00:24:15.638]  These other places are out there.
[00:24:15.638 --> 00:24:17.300]  Gab is out there.
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:21.343]  But the traffic just isn't there.
[00:24:21.343 --> 00:24:34.232]  And so InfoWars.com's last show is now the mothership where we have to drive all the traffic for our 10 hours of live broadcasts a day.
[00:24:34.232 --> 00:24:35.013]  And it's not cheap.
[00:24:36.587 --> 00:24:41.690]  To have all that bandwidth and had to have all this traffic coming here now.
[00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:54.258]  And it also is basically like chopping off our arms and legs when it comes to being able to market ourselves, expand our market reach, and try to sell the products that we have at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:24:55.816 --> 00:25:10.853]  Thank God the InfoWars audience is loyal and really just has a deep understanding of exactly what's going on and so you do support us at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for that and I salute you for that.
[00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:11.554]  And I gotta tell ya...
[00:25:12.984 --> 00:25:15.506]  Turbo Force is 33% off right now.
[00:25:15.506 --> 00:25:22.092]  I drank Turbo Force yesterday at, well I guess it was after the first segment, during the break.
[00:25:22.092 --> 00:25:31.920]  So about 11.06, give or take, yesterday, I drank Turbo Force.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:39.987]  I did six hours of live broadcasts, and then I played basketball for two hours last night.
[00:25:39.987 --> 00:25:40.647]  And I didn't have to
[00:25:41.618 --> 00:25:47.459]  Drink any more coffee, no more caffeine, no more stimulant, the rest of the day.
[00:25:47.459 --> 00:25:52.561]  That's how powerful turbo force is.
[00:25:52.561 --> 00:26:01.303]  And I'm telling you, it's not, this is not me complaining, you find out real quick, you do a three hour live broadcast, it'll take it out of you.
[00:26:01.303 --> 00:26:08.364]  But on turbo force, it's just like, phew.
[00:26:08.364 --> 00:26:11.145]  Now today, I will admit, I'm drinking coffee.
[00:26:12.065 --> 00:26:13.546]  I just felt like changing it up today.
[00:26:13.546 --> 00:26:17.987]  I kinda just had the taste for some coffee today.
[00:26:17.987 --> 00:26:19.968]  So I'll probably need like three or four cups.
[00:26:19.968 --> 00:26:21.288]  I'm already finished with my first cup.
[00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:24.669]  I'm gonna need another cup within the first hour.
[00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:29.951]  If I had drank Turbo Force this morning, I wouldn't need coffee the rest of the day.
[00:26:29.951 --> 00:26:34.012]  And I'll be back hosting the warm-up again today, too, with Rob Dew.
[00:26:34.012 --> 00:26:38.814]  So the products that we sell at Infowarsstore.com are the real deal.
[00:26:39.745 --> 00:26:44.409]  And we've got these great specials because we want you to try them and find out for yourself.
[00:26:44.409 --> 00:26:49.973]  Try the Alpha Power for yourself and see the positive effects.
[00:26:49.973 --> 00:26:55.017]  Try the bodies for yourself and see how the inflammation goes down.
[00:26:55.017 --> 00:26:58.360]  Try the Turbo Force for yourself and see the sustained energy.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:02.784]  Try the protein bars for yourself, 40% off when you buy two or more boxes at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:27:04.938 --> 00:27:11.086]  I dare you to go find a better tasting peanut butter chocolate protein bar.
[00:27:11.086 --> 00:27:21.298]  Now I'm not the biggest fan of coconut or vanilla to be honest, but the people around here that like coconut love the vanilla coconut one.
[00:27:21.298 --> 00:27:23.821]  I am a chocolate fiend.
[00:27:24.918 --> 00:27:33.802]  And so the Peanut Butter Chocolate Protein Bar, which to me is really just like a double fudge brownie covered in chocolate, or covered in peanut butter, excuse me.
[00:27:33.802 --> 00:27:36.743]  Oh, it just sounds awful, doesn't it?
[00:27:36.743 --> 00:27:44.527]  The InfoWars Life Protein Bar, a double fudge brownie covered in peanut butter with 15 grams of protein.
[00:27:44.527 --> 00:27:48.549]  Won't find that anywhere else, but at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:51.430]  So thank you so much for your support, ladies and gentlemen, and look,
[00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:57.073]  Alex isn't going anywhere.
[00:27:57.073 --> 00:27:59.715]  I'm not going anywhere.
[00:27:59.715 --> 00:28:02.578]  David Knight is not going anywhere.
[00:28:02.578 --> 00:28:03.919]  We've committed.
[00:28:03.919 --> 00:28:06.501]  We know the role that we have here.
[00:28:06.501 --> 00:28:12.226]  And so, if they shoot the Millennium Falcon down out of the sky, we go down with it.
[00:28:12.226 --> 00:28:21.034]  But as long as you continue to fuel the engine at Infowarstore.com, the Millennium Falcon can continue to jump into hyperdrive
[00:28:22.481 --> 00:28:32.208]  And continue to survive as we assault the fake news and the lies of the New World Order.
[00:28:32.208 --> 00:28:36.251]  When we come back on the other side, Jacob Wool joins us.
[00:28:36.251 --> 00:28:38.553]  He's been freshly banned off Twitter.
[00:28:38.553 --> 00:28:39.554]  He's such a bad guy.
[00:28:40.646 --> 00:28:49.714]  For daring to take action and go investigate claims that Ilhan Omar married her brother to get a green card.
[00:28:49.714 --> 00:28:56.540]  Well hey, if the government's not gonna investigate it, if no one's gonna investigate it, I guess we have to do it ourselves, don't we?
[00:28:59.554 --> 00:29:00.755]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:29:00.755 --> 00:29:04.678]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:29:04.678 --> 00:29:06.219]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:29:06.219 --> 00:29:09.181]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:14.745]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:29:14.745 --> 00:29:15.946]  I can help you, too.
[00:29:15.946 --> 00:29:18.888]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:29:18.888 --> 00:29:21.110]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:25.553]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:29:25.553 --> 00:29:27.855]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:13.723]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:16.704]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:32:16.704 --> 00:32:18.444]  How can I solve that problem?

[00:33:03.847 --> 00:33:06.449]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.456 --> 00:33:26.500]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:35.986]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:35.986 --> 00:33:37.167]  Always on the troll.
[00:33:37.167 --> 00:33:44.392]  Alright, Jacob Wool, ladies and gentlemen, had to reschedule.
[00:33:45.373 --> 00:33:58.280]  No worries though, he'll be joining us in 30 minutes from now to make the announcement or to tease what he's going to announce in his press conference.
[00:33:59.969 --> 00:34:10.572]  As far as the investigation into Ilhan Omar marrying her brother is concerned, and if you want the story on that, you can go to jihadilhan.com.
[00:34:10.572 --> 00:34:13.973]  That's jihadilhan.com.
[00:34:13.973 --> 00:34:19.735]  It's hosted by Culture, but that is the name of the site.
[00:34:19.735 --> 00:34:23.596]  And, you know, it's sad that we have to send
[00:34:26.072 --> 00:34:36.815]  Basically private investigators, not official PIs, but just citizen investigators to do these investigations because we get nothing from our government.
[00:34:36.815 --> 00:34:40.736]  It's really a joke, quite frankly.
[00:34:40.736 --> 00:34:41.536]  But so here's what we're going to do.
[00:34:41.536 --> 00:34:43.916]  I'm going to cover some news in this segment.
[00:34:43.916 --> 00:34:46.437]  In the next segment, we're going to be hearing from Alex Jones.
[00:34:48.809 --> 00:34:59.555]  And he's going to be responding to really the viral moment when he erupted over the fact that Democrats just say, let that baby die.
[00:34:59.555 --> 00:35:05.639]  So illegal, I can't even really comprehend how this is happening, quite frankly, but that's the deal.
[00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:07.059]  So that's what we have coming up.
[00:35:09.849 --> 00:35:19.289]  I am going to, my plan is to dedicate the entire third hour, the entire one o'clock central hour to your phone calls.
[00:35:20.325 --> 00:35:34.412]  I did not take enough phone calls yesterday on the war room, and I know that the audience is chomping at the bit to respond to Alex Jones and Joe Rogan, to respond to the Cohen testimony, and to everything else that's going on right now.
[00:35:34.412 --> 00:35:39.955]  So I'm planning on dedicating the entire one o'clock, third hour to your phone calls.
[00:35:39.955 --> 00:35:41.236]  We may even get to them before that.
[00:35:41.236 --> 00:35:45.698]  But let me again just go through all of the news that I have here.
[00:35:48.413 --> 00:35:53.216]  And then kind of lay the groundwork for where everything goes next.
[00:35:53.216 --> 00:35:57.238]  Now, here were the big stories from yesterday.
[00:35:57.238 --> 00:35:58.718]  The Trump-Kim summit.
[00:35:58.718 --> 00:36:01.420]  Now, apparently this deal did not go down.
[00:36:03.737 --> 00:36:12.702]  And of course, I'm going to wait and see how it all shakes out and what the President's final comments are before I really decide whether this was a failure or not.
[00:36:12.702 --> 00:36:16.824]  But today the headlines are saying it was not good.
[00:36:16.824 --> 00:36:18.065]  Yesterday, headlines good.
[00:36:18.065 --> 00:36:20.106]  Today, headlines not good.
[00:36:20.106 --> 00:36:22.007]  But let's wait and see.
[00:36:22.007 --> 00:36:25.810]  You had Pakistan and India almost get into a full-blown war.
[00:36:27.276 --> 00:36:30.237]  And it almost barely really made the news.
[00:36:30.237 --> 00:36:34.139]  Airstrikes, tanks heading to the border and planes shot down.
[00:36:34.139 --> 00:36:35.600]  India and Pakistan are in a state of war.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.300]  That's from Michael Snyder.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:46.344]  The AP this morning, Pakistan pledges to release captive Indian fighter pilot to hopefully ease the tensions there.
[00:36:46.344 --> 00:36:47.605]  Then you had the Cohen testimony.
[00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:51.026]  A big fat circus.
[00:36:51.026 --> 00:36:55.749]  If you ask me, a total Democrat deep state run event.
[00:36:55.749 --> 00:36:56.229]  Clearly.
[00:36:58.224 --> 00:37:04.407]  And some of the highlights include Cohen hinting that the New York Feds are probing Trump for undisclosed crimes.
[00:37:04.407 --> 00:37:07.049]  Folks, you need to understand, this is all hype.
[00:37:07.049 --> 00:37:10.571]  If Trump, if they had anything on Trump, they'd already remove him from office.
[00:37:10.571 --> 00:37:11.531]  They have nothing.
[00:37:11.531 --> 00:37:12.672]  They have nothing!
[00:37:14.953 --> 00:37:18.534]  Oh, and Cohen's afraid there won't be a peaceful transition of power.
[00:37:18.534 --> 00:37:21.615]  See, and then he also says that Trump behaves like a mobster.
[00:37:21.615 --> 00:37:22.575]  So wait a second.
[00:37:22.575 --> 00:37:26.396]  They're the ones... Mueller's the one behaving like a mobster.
[00:37:26.396 --> 00:37:28.897]  The Democrats are the ones behaving like a mobster.
[00:37:28.897 --> 00:37:33.178]  Go out and harass our enemies.
[00:37:33.178 --> 00:37:35.578]  They're the ones that will not relinquish power.
[00:37:35.578 --> 00:37:36.839]  It's the Democrats!
[00:37:37.915 --> 00:37:42.416]  That lost power in the 2016 election that are now resorting to violence.
[00:37:42.416 --> 00:37:46.797]  Do you see how they project everything they are?
[00:37:46.797 --> 00:37:58.399]  It's almost, I mean, at this point, I think there needs to be a new psychological issue here.
[00:37:58.399 --> 00:38:06.601]  Because this is, there's pathological lying, there's projection, there's Stockholm Syndrome, there's all this stuff.
[00:38:07.606 --> 00:38:12.531]  They, it's like, this is pathological projection.
[00:38:12.531 --> 00:38:13.472]  That's what this is.
[00:38:13.472 --> 00:38:18.017]  It's pathological perpetual projection.
[00:38:18.017 --> 00:38:22.841]  Not meaning to alliterate here, but it's pathological perpetual projection.
[00:38:22.841 --> 00:38:27.946]  They are constantly projecting who they are onto everyone else
[00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:30.670]  And it's perpetual.
[00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:31.811]  It never stops.
[00:38:31.811 --> 00:38:32.731]  And they believe it.
[00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:35.233]  They can't even help themselves.
[00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:41.157]  So pretty much anything you see from Democrats these days is them projecting.
[00:38:41.157 --> 00:38:42.298]  Trump's a racist.
[00:38:42.298 --> 00:38:43.799]  They're racists.
[00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:45.280]  Trump's going to destroy the economy.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.403]  They want to destroy the economy.
[00:38:48.403 --> 00:38:49.803]  Trump hates children.
[00:38:49.803 --> 00:38:53.526]  They literally let babies die.
[00:38:53.526 --> 00:38:58.229]  Everything they do is projection!
[00:38:58.229 --> 00:38:58.770]  But of course,
[00:39:00.183 --> 00:39:05.647]  Alex Jones on the Joe Rogan Podcast somehow topped all of it on social media yesterday.
[00:39:05.647 --> 00:39:16.914]  I've already covered this, but pull up the image again, just because I'm telling you, this is major, major red pill territory right here.
[00:39:16.914 --> 00:39:19.856]  And I know that most people know CNN is totally fake news.
[00:39:19.856 --> 00:39:21.337]  Even most people in the middle.
[00:39:22.205 --> 00:39:30.710]  But when you actually see the fact that they plant all these people at these town halls, you think you're having an organic event.
[00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:36.633]  You think you're having a real event with real Americans asking real questions to real candidates.
[00:39:36.633 --> 00:39:38.294]  It's all fake.
[00:39:38.294 --> 00:39:39.814]  It's all fake.
[00:39:39.814 --> 00:39:42.056]  The whole presentation is fake.
[00:39:42.056 --> 00:39:50.280]  All the people that they have in these town halls are selected from Democrat and leftist activist groups, ladies and gentlemen, every damn time.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.402]  And this is the first time where I've really seen the internet pick this up and run with it.
[00:39:57.402 --> 00:40:00.483]  Because other people have done this before.
[00:40:00.483 --> 00:40:08.826]  Where they go and they find out who these people that CNN has on their town halls are, and every time they find out, they're damn Democrat donors.
[00:40:08.826 --> 00:40:11.307]  Every time.
[00:40:11.307 --> 00:40:17.470]  And you know, it's not quite like the issue, you know what, I'm not even gonna say it, but you know, it is odd.
[00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:25.138]  How CNN interviews the same person multiple times at multiple different events.
[00:40:25.138 --> 00:40:29.400]  But that's a separate issue that we're not allowed to talk about.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.501]  This is blatantly in your face.
[00:40:31.501 --> 00:40:44.889]  And to me, the average American, even that might not think CNN is that bad, when you realize that CNN plants all their town hall participants, when they select every single one of them from Democrat groups,
[00:40:45.848 --> 00:40:49.852]  I mean, if that doesn't show you how fake CNN actually is, I don't know what will.
[00:40:49.852 --> 00:40:56.238]  The whole thing is scripted, folks, but I digress.
[00:40:56.238 --> 00:41:00.482]  2020 Democrats are under pressure to embrace sweeping political reforms.
[00:41:00.482 --> 00:41:01.402]  This is from McClatchy.
[00:41:01.402 --> 00:41:11.372]  So basically, you have all these people that are about to announce, you know, Biden probably, O'Rourke probably, and they have to decide what they're going to do.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:19.302]  Are you going to be going with the full-on socialist reform like Cortez and Sanders would like?
[00:41:19.302 --> 00:41:25.463]  Or are you going to retreat to real Americana and go back to actual jobs?
[00:41:25.463 --> 00:41:27.504]  Go back to actual issues?
[00:41:27.504 --> 00:41:32.285]  And so the Democrats are kind of lost in no man's land right now.
[00:41:32.285 --> 00:41:34.266]  How about this one though?
[00:41:34.266 --> 00:41:37.126]  Dush challenges governor on police handling of illegal immigrants.
[00:41:37.126 --> 00:41:39.347]  Now, the original story broke
[00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:55.017]  Early February, and I just found it this morning, the state of Pennsylvania has now made it a declaration, basically, that their state troopers are not allowed to enforce immigration law.
[00:41:55.017 --> 00:41:59.499]  So, if a state trooper pulls over an illegal immigrant, they have to let him go.
[00:41:59.499 --> 00:42:00.019]  Literally!
[00:42:00.019 --> 00:42:02.981]  I mean, can you imagine?
[00:42:02.981 --> 00:42:06.562]  If you got pulled over for a DUI, do you get to be let go?
[00:42:06.562 --> 00:42:07.743]  Well, if you're not a citizen, yes.
[00:42:09.352 --> 00:42:11.413]  So, do you realize how ridiculous this is?
[00:42:11.413 --> 00:42:27.399]  So, an area lawmaker said instructions given by the Wolf administration to the state police of Pennsylvania forces our troopers to make Pennsylvania a de facto sanctuary state, a statement that a spokesman for Governor Tom Wolf was quick to dispute.
[00:42:27.399 --> 00:42:28.000]  No!
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.941]  No, Governor Wolf!
[00:42:30.941 --> 00:42:31.101]  You...
[00:42:32.378 --> 00:42:39.423]  Made the declaration that state troopers are not allowed to enforce immigration law, and if they have an illegal immigrant, they're not allowed to do anything with it.
[00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:40.004]  That was you!
[00:42:40.004 --> 00:42:42.746]  So, so, I mean, I've read the U.S.
[00:42:42.746 --> 00:42:43.106]  Code.
[00:42:43.106 --> 00:42:43.866]  That's illegal!
[00:42:43.866 --> 00:42:45.488]  You belong in jail!
[00:42:45.488 --> 00:42:50.031]  The governor of Pennsylvania belongs in jail!
[00:42:50.031 --> 00:42:53.413]  But don't expect that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:53.413 --> 00:42:56.115]  Don't expect any justice in this country, don't you know?
[00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:57.797]  We got Robert Mueller running the show.
[00:42:59.209 --> 00:43:04.634]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:43:04.634 --> 00:43:06.435]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:43:06.435 --> 00:43:08.177]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[00:43:08.177 --> 00:43:10.018]  Now, I can make them strong.
[00:43:10.018 --> 00:43:11.660]  Now, I can instruct them.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.401]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[00:43:13.401 --> 00:43:14.382]  But not once I'm gone.
[00:43:14.482 --> 00:43:19.625]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:25.229]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:43:25.229 --> 00:43:28.852]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:43:28.852 --> 00:43:29.892]  I can't be destroyed now.
[00:43:29.892 --> 00:43:35.236]  As long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth, and you can't be destroyed either.
[00:43:35.236 --> 00:43:44.382]  As long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it, and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:43:44.482 --> 00:43:52.131]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:58.719]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.

[00:45:00.385 --> 00:45:02.627]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:45:02.627 --> 00:45:04.368]  There is no set stasis.
[00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:05.609]  There is no managed system.
[00:45:05.609 --> 00:45:07.250]  There is no un-continuum.
[00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.473]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:45:10.473 --> 00:45:13.835]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[00:45:13.835 --> 00:45:15.076]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[00:45:15.076 --> 00:45:15.877]  We'll be here forever.
[00:45:15.877 --> 00:45:17.118]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:45:17.118 --> 00:45:24.003]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:45:24.003 --> 00:45:24.584]  We made it.
[00:45:24.584 --> 00:45:26.745]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:45:26.745 --> 00:45:28.547]  God's got a big war for you, Revy.
[00:45:28.547 --> 00:45:28.927]  And so
[00:45:29.127 --> 00:45:35.653]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:45:35.653 --> 00:45:40.637]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:45:40.637 --> 00:45:43.500]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:45.882]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:45:45.882 --> 00:45:49.405]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[00:45:49.405 --> 00:45:50.426]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:45:50.686 --> 00:45:54.949]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[00:45:54.949 --> 00:45:57.831]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:45:57.831 --> 00:45:58.912]  I want life.
[00:45:58.912 --> 00:46:00.373]  I want Jesus.
[00:46:00.373 --> 00:46:00.893]  It's simple.
[00:46:00.893 --> 00:46:06.997]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:09.479]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[00:46:09.479 --> 00:46:13.141]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all great it is.
[00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:15.883]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[00:46:15.883 --> 00:46:16.984]  What is the top tumor?
[00:46:16.984 --> 00:46:19.105]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[00:46:19.105 --> 00:46:20.486]  And what's the best lab?
[00:46:20.486 --> 00:46:21.507]  We're gonna have 95% curcuminoid.
[00:46:43.646 --> 00:46:46.567]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive.
[00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:47.188]  Our fish oil.
[00:46:47.188 --> 00:46:49.709]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[00:46:49.709 --> 00:46:50.770]  My children take it.
[00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:55.112]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[00:46:55.112 --> 00:46:58.133]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[00:46:58.133 --> 00:46:58.594]  Never!
[00:46:58.594 --> 00:47:03.396]  Enforcedware.com.
[00:47:03.396 --> 00:47:06.057]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:28.746 --> 00:47:30.667]  For humanity.
[00:47:30.667 --> 00:47:34.328]  And I'm going to tell you why.
[00:47:34.328 --> 00:47:38.689]  We know that the whole system works on compartmentalization.
[00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:46.551]  And this dehumanization, post-human project is rolling out its censorship, its psychological manipulation.
[00:47:46.551 --> 00:47:50.192]  Because it's behind schedule.
[00:47:50.192 --> 00:47:55.254]  It's ramped it up and accelerated it past what the controllers
[00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:59.701]  Believe will actually work.
[00:47:59.701 --> 00:48:01.822]  So you ask them, why are they doing it?
[00:48:01.822 --> 00:48:03.783]  Because we're beating them.
[00:48:03.783 --> 00:48:06.524]  And so they're having to gamble.
[00:48:06.524 --> 00:48:10.166]  And they are gambling that you're weak.
[00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:13.987]  They're gambling that you're not going to stay conscious.
[00:48:13.987 --> 00:48:24.912]  And they're gambling that you're not able to differentiate all the different streams of data that are out there in the kind of fog or smoke screen that is
[00:48:27.208 --> 00:48:33.955]  Being projected out there, all the thousands of different voices, all the millions of different pieces of disinformation.
[00:48:33.955 --> 00:48:36.537]  So here's the really good news.
[00:48:36.537 --> 00:48:38.319]  I've been friends with Joe Rogan for 20 years.
[00:48:38.319 --> 00:48:39.920]  I got really mad at him.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.503]  And he does interview a lot of people.
[00:48:42.503 --> 00:48:47.067]  And then you can make the connection to those people and the connection to him and say he's a bad guy.
[00:48:47.067 --> 00:48:50.231]  But after I had a chance to talk to Joe, and I'll talk more about this on the show,
[00:48:51.457 --> 00:48:55.319]  Later, I understand what basically unfolded and what happened.
[00:48:55.319 --> 00:49:00.021]  We had a lot of private discussions the last three weeks or so before I came on the show.
[00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:01.082]  And most of that's private.
[00:49:01.082 --> 00:49:12.168]  But the big thing was Joe was just caught up with his comedy and his podcast and all the other things he's doing in the UFC where he was working seven days a week.
[00:49:12.168 --> 00:49:14.429]  The guy has a super work ethic.
[00:49:14.429 --> 00:49:17.210]  I mean, probably works more than I do.
[00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:20.232]  And he just didn't want conflict.
[00:49:21.627 --> 00:49:27.318]  And he just didn't want to be plugged into the fight against the globalists because that's not what he signed up for.
[00:49:27.318 --> 00:49:33.089]  But things have gotten so bad in this whole crisis we've seen of censorship.
[00:49:34.801 --> 00:49:41.485]  Forced him to not, under my pressure, do the right thing, but forced him to pull back and reassess.
[00:49:41.485 --> 00:49:44.166]  And I didn't just believe the things Joe told me.
[00:49:44.166 --> 00:49:48.028]  I had actually been following what he was doing because I'd gotten real interested in it.
[00:49:48.028 --> 00:49:50.049]  And trying to see whether he was a good guy or a bad guy.
[00:49:50.049 --> 00:49:52.371]  And I saw him saying, I'm cutting back on UFC.
[00:49:52.371 --> 00:49:55.833]  I'm only going to do major events, not ESPN.
[00:49:55.833 --> 00:49:57.754]  I'm cutting back on other things.
[00:49:57.754 --> 00:50:00.395]  You know, to spend time with my family and focus on the podcast.
[00:50:00.395 --> 00:50:01.195]  So what he was telling me,
[00:50:02.476 --> 00:50:07.957]  Privately, I was kind of cyber-stalking him, and already saw him actually saying and doing his own line.
[00:50:07.957 --> 00:50:14.539]  So I think, if I did anything, I kind of forced him to pull back and reassess what he was doing.
[00:50:14.539 --> 00:50:17.639]  And he did apologize to me, and then I felt guilty.
[00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:18.900]  Because, I mean, I went overboard.
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.180]  Jesus didn't tell me to go after a destroyer.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:28.282]  I mean, God, the Holy Spirit, does want me to wage war on the globalists.
[00:50:28.282 --> 00:50:29.302]  And so, by extension,
[00:50:31.704 --> 00:50:36.349]  So by extension, I was just labeling him the enemy.
[00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:40.253]  Celebrate more of the ceremony.
[00:50:40.253 --> 00:50:45.258]  Now let me make the really big point, and this is the super good news.
[00:50:45.258 --> 00:50:48.341]  Joe did not know
[00:50:49.785 --> 00:50:52.627]  That they are keeping babies alive and harvesting their organs here in the U.S.
[00:50:52.627 --> 00:51:03.494]  And he didn't know that people like the governor of Virginia are trying to introduce that to the public now, because they know, because of lawsuits and undercover video, it's coming out.
[00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:09.438]  And it's such a huge crime, hiding in plain view, it will discredit the entire tyrannical medical system.
[00:51:09.438 --> 00:51:13.761]  I'm not saying all doctors are bad, I'm talking about the administrators, the system, the dehumanizing grid.
[00:51:15.762 --> 00:51:25.726]  And so, during the show and after the podcast, Thursday that's already on its way to the number one podcast in history, Joe was completely freaked out by it and was looking at it, was talking about it.
[00:51:25.726 --> 00:51:29.267]  We went to dinner for like two hours.
[00:51:29.267 --> 00:51:34.068]  And it just totally flipped his paradigm even more that how real all this is.
[00:51:34.068 --> 00:51:38.110]  And again, when I told him about human-animal clones,
[00:51:39.864 --> 00:51:41.265]  He looked it up and found it on MIT.
[00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:42.385]  He really didn't know all that.
[00:51:42.385 --> 00:51:44.086]  And he's a smart guy.
[00:51:44.086 --> 00:51:49.508]  I was seeing him go through the same kind of awakening that we've all gone through.
[00:51:49.508 --> 00:51:51.929]  And then he was talking about, well, then how do we take action?
[00:51:51.929 --> 00:51:54.109]  Because he understands he's got kids.
[00:51:54.109 --> 00:51:56.770]  You can't just ignore this stuff and have it go away.
[00:51:56.770 --> 00:52:00.492]  It's so bad that it makes you take action against it.
[00:52:00.492 --> 00:52:02.392]  So it hit me this morning.
[00:52:02.392 --> 00:52:03.413]  I woke up at like 5 a.m.
[00:52:03.413 --> 00:52:04.873]  about to fly back to Texas.
[00:52:04.873 --> 00:52:08.215]  We're at the airport as you hear.
[00:52:08.215 --> 00:52:08.915]  And it just hit me.
[00:52:10.265 --> 00:52:11.106]  How big the stakes are.
[00:52:11.106 --> 00:52:13.027]  I was thinking about other wars.
[00:52:13.027 --> 00:52:16.249]  I was thinking about other things humanity's gone through.
[00:52:16.249 --> 00:52:19.071]  And I was thinking, you know, this is a war.
[00:52:19.071 --> 00:52:25.235]  And I was talking a few hours later to the producer of the show, Daria, and we were talking about how this really is a full-spectrum war.
[00:52:25.235 --> 00:52:27.036]  We're not just saying we're in a war.
[00:52:27.036 --> 00:52:31.239]  And when you realize that, you say, well, who are the combatants?
[00:52:31.239 --> 00:52:34.962]  They're unborn babies, and now because they sold us on that,
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:51.073]  Now it's babies that have been born, and we've seen all the case for killing Granny in Newsweek and Time, and now they're wanting us to euthanize old people, and we're literally being taught that we're just human resources, and that we're crap.
[00:52:52.287 --> 00:52:56.712]  And once we dehumanize old people, then it's on more babies, now it's babies after they're already born.
[00:52:56.712 --> 00:52:59.635]  And everybody's sitting back going, how is this possible?
[00:52:59.635 --> 00:53:02.078]  It's illegal to kill a baby that's already born.
[00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:06.964]  But that's why the governor, who's a medical doctor, an organ harvester, that's why he said...
[00:53:08.661 --> 00:53:10.582]  Oh, we resuscitate, but the mother wants to keep it.
[00:53:10.582 --> 00:53:12.403]  The baby's alive.
[00:53:12.403 --> 00:53:14.284]  They're not considering it alive, though.
[00:53:14.284 --> 00:53:20.246]  They, as the bioethics board playing God, they wave a magic wand and say, we resuscitate.
[00:53:20.246 --> 00:53:25.929]  And then we're now saying, wave a magic wand, by the bioethics board, you have life.
[00:53:25.929 --> 00:53:26.909]  That's how they work.
[00:53:26.909 --> 00:53:28.530]  And this is where doctors become gods.
[00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.471]  That's why about 20 years ago, they got rid of the Hippocratic Oath in Europe.
[00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:35.493]  They got rid of it here 15 years ago in medical schools of Hippocrates, where you say, do no harm.
[00:53:36.363 --> 00:53:43.848]  They are literally now at the top, a death code, teaching us all this and our babies that are already born.
[00:53:43.848 --> 00:53:47.430]  I was sitting there talking to one of my security guys at breakfast.
[00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:52.993]  And I said, listen, I'm not calling for people to go in and shoot up abortion clinics because that only turns them into the victims.
[00:53:52.993 --> 00:53:58.236]  Sure, they're killing babies in there, but in their own weird world, they're saying they're not.
[00:53:58.236 --> 00:54:00.498]  But I said, what happens?
[00:54:00.498 --> 00:54:05.801]  What happens when people learn that they're killing babies after they're born, they're totally healthy?
[00:54:06.874 --> 00:54:07.994]  I mean, this is beyond eugenics.
[00:54:07.994 --> 00:54:10.395]  This is just taking their organs.
[00:54:10.395 --> 00:54:17.418]  What's gonna happen if somebody goes after those folks and then they're on trial and the jury's hearing how it's an already born baby?
[00:54:17.418 --> 00:54:17.578]  See?
[00:54:17.578 --> 00:54:19.179]  See how that works?
[00:54:19.179 --> 00:54:21.240]  So it's okay to kill the babies.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.281]  It's okay to kill the babies.
[00:54:23.281 --> 00:54:24.882]  So it's okay to kill babies.
[00:54:24.882 --> 00:54:31.384]  But if I even talk about somebody attacking an abortion clinic and say I don't even want it to happen, still it's like, ooh, that's human life.
[00:54:31.384 --> 00:54:33.045]  Don't even discuss someone taking action.
[00:54:35.905 --> 00:54:39.226]  And I was talking to my friend, and he goes, yeah, well, that's already happened.
[00:54:39.226 --> 00:54:43.467]  And the courts have ruled that that wasn't right, because the other kids weren't human.
[00:54:43.467 --> 00:54:45.367]  I said, I know, because they weren't born yet.
[00:54:45.367 --> 00:54:47.268]  And he goes, oh, yeah.
[00:54:47.268 --> 00:54:48.608]  And see this lot of hand?
[00:54:48.608 --> 00:54:50.588]  Now it's already born.
[00:54:50.588 --> 00:54:51.649]  New York's passed the law.
[00:54:51.649 --> 00:54:53.289]  Other states are passing the law.
[00:54:53.289 --> 00:55:00.911]  And now, because people are so taken back, because it's just over the top, we're hit by something so out of control, so evil, we don't even know how to respond.
[00:55:00.911 --> 00:55:01.711]  I mean, it was Hitler.
[00:55:06.058 --> 00:55:06.678]  We're good to go.
[00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:31.692]  Because the enemy's making their move right now, and they need radio silence, they need us to not communicate, and then they can try to condition everyone to accept the new normal.
[00:55:31.692 --> 00:55:35.635]  That we're all just a bunch of meat to the corporate establishment, like Communist China.
[00:55:35.635 --> 00:55:37.016]  But no, that's not gonna happen.
[00:55:37.016 --> 00:55:37.997]  Our humanity's coming back.
[00:55:38.937 --> 00:55:48.762]  And even people out here in the middle of evil LA are having huge awakenings and choosing what side they're on because they're being challenged, and they're being educated, and they're being informed.
[00:55:48.762 --> 00:55:57.867]  So whether it's in person, or whether it's calling to talk radio, whether it's speaking at your church, or whether it's talking to folks at the company picnic, your voice is more important and more powerful than ever.
[00:55:57.867 --> 00:55:58.968]  You are the leaders.
[00:55:58.968 --> 00:56:01.249]  And I'm not just saying that to make you feel important.
[00:56:01.249 --> 00:56:02.090]  Damn it, you're everything.
[00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:06.133]  So, let's take action, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:06.133 --> 00:56:08.135]  And let's speak the truth.
[00:56:08.135 --> 00:56:10.857]  Let's expose what this satanic agenda is.
[00:56:10.857 --> 00:56:12.779]  Because that's what it is.
[00:56:12.779 --> 00:56:20.585]  And just commend ourselves to do whatever it takes to defend the children of this country and this planet.
[00:56:20.585 --> 00:56:24.328]  Alright, I'm going to throw it back to Owen Schroyer in the ATX.
[00:56:24.328 --> 00:56:24.809]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:56:24.809 --> 00:56:25.810]  Thank you for all your prayers.
[00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:27.571]  Thank you for all your support, for everything you do.
[00:56:27.571 --> 00:56:29.293]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[00:56:29.293 --> 00:56:30.173]  So again, I salute you all.
[00:56:30.173 --> 00:56:30.534]  God bless you.
[00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:38.756]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, the latest story from Micah Bilger, LifeNews.com.
[00:56:38.756 --> 00:56:47.544]  Planned Parenthood doctors said she would break the baby's neck if born alive after abortion.
[00:56:47.544 --> 00:56:53.650]  Well, I think they realize that that does a little bit of damage to their product there.
[00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:56.713]  And so now they just say, ooh, that baby was born?
[00:56:57.515 --> 00:57:00.117]  Yeah, just don't give it any treatment, just let it die.
[00:57:00.117 --> 00:57:06.982]  It'll be in perfect condition when we want to harvest its organs and harvest its blood.
[00:57:06.982 --> 00:57:16.228]  And you gotta wonder, folks, with this type of stuff going on, who are these people?
[00:57:16.228 --> 00:57:21.392]  I know we talk about not dehumanizing people, but are these people even human?
[00:57:21.392 --> 00:57:22.193]  Or are these just...
[00:57:23.394 --> 00:57:41.363]  Literal NPCs put on this plane by God as a test to say, look, if you can't stand up against these creatures, these NPCs I've created that just let babies die, then you're not going to the next level with me.
[00:57:41.363 --> 00:57:47.686]  If you can't stand up for unborn life, you can stay down here with Satan.
[00:57:47.686 --> 00:57:48.546]  Unbelievable, folks.
[00:57:58.646 --> 00:58:07.651]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:17.717]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:58:17.717 --> 00:58:26.263]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:58:27.083 --> 00:58:28.424]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:58:28.424 --> 00:58:29.585]  You must experience it.
[00:58:29.585 --> 00:58:31.546]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:58:31.546 --> 00:58:36.589]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:38.110]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:39.591]  It lasts 10 hours.
[00:58:39.591 --> 00:58:46.276]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:58:46.276 --> 00:58:50.659]  Turbo Force at m4slive.com.
[00:58:50.659 --> 00:58:53.741]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[00:58:53.741 --> 00:58:55.282]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[00:58:56.635 --> 00:58:59.601]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:58:59.601 --> 00:59:03.651]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patreon supply.

[00:59:53.332 --> 00:59:55.954]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:21.420]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Newsweek is now emailing us right now, telling us we're spreading conspiracy theories when it comes to Democrats killing babies after they're born and harvesting their organs.
[01:00:26.235 --> 01:00:39.467]  Do you think they're emailing us right now, they're like, will you comment on the conspiracy theory that you guys are spreading, that Democrats are letting born babies die, and that they're harvesting their organs?
[01:00:39.467 --> 01:00:44.931]  Will you provide comment about the conspiracies and the lies you're spreading?
[01:00:44.931 --> 01:00:48.755]  As if I get enjoyment out of talking about this.
[01:00:50.353 --> 01:00:57.238]  Like, as if Alex Jones and I and David Knight come on air and we're excited!
[01:00:57.238 --> 01:00:58.780]  We're so excited!
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:02.543]  We're going to talk about how the Democrats want to kill babies!
[01:01:03.755 --> 01:01:05.396]  Yay!
[01:01:05.396 --> 01:01:12.980]  And I'm so excited to come up here and talk about the undercover video where they say they're going to sell the baby parts!
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.301]  It's so exciting!
[01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:17.903]  Do I want to provide comment to Newsweek?
[01:01:17.903 --> 01:01:19.024]  Oh yes!
[01:01:19.024 --> 01:01:22.225]  I love talking about how the Democrats want to kill babies!
[01:01:22.225 --> 01:01:23.146]  It's so fun!
[01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:25.967]  Oh!
[01:01:25.967 --> 01:01:26.088]  Oh!
[01:01:29.133 --> 01:01:31.874]  Newsweek wants comment?
[01:01:31.874 --> 01:01:34.934]  Oh, okay Newsweek, I'll tell you what.
[01:01:34.934 --> 01:01:36.795]  Here's a comment for you.
[01:01:36.795 --> 01:01:41.456]  Go yourself.
[01:01:41.456 --> 01:01:42.556]  How about that?
[01:01:42.556 --> 01:01:44.457]  There's a comment for you.
[01:01:44.457 --> 01:01:50.818]  We're trying to raise awareness that there's babies that are getting born, breathing, hearts beating.
[01:01:50.818 --> 01:01:55.640]  In fact, the heart beats, I think it's like a couple weeks after conception even.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.140]  If you, Newsweek,
[01:01:58.684 --> 01:02:10.100]  If you, Newsweek, want to stand on the side of letting babies die, then you can go yourself.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:10.741]  Okay?
[01:02:10.741 --> 01:02:12.804]  How about that for a comment, Newsweek?
[01:02:12.804 --> 01:02:14.045]  Publish that!
[01:02:14.045 --> 01:02:14.906]  And then while you're at it,
[01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:40.499]  If you don't mind, in the same story where you're publishing my comment to you, requesting comment on us spreading wild conspiracy theories about Democrats letting babies die and harvesting their organs, why don't you go ahead and put the video of Ralph Northam talking about how they'll resuscitate the baby and then decide, that's them saying, and then let it die, deciding to let it die.
[01:02:42.475 --> 01:02:57.803]  And then why don't you also upload the video, undercover tape, which was just ruled in the court, it was all real, not doctored, not edited, Planned Parenthood doctors talking about selling baby parts so they can buy Ferraris.
[01:02:57.803 --> 01:02:59.624]  And then this just came out today.
[01:02:59.624 --> 01:03:03.606]  I mean, just today.
[01:03:03.606 --> 01:03:08.609]  Planned Parenthood doctor said she would break the baby's neck if born alive after abortion.
[01:03:08.609 --> 01:03:09.770]  Oh, Newsweek!
[01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:14.692]  I'll tell you what, Newsweek.
[01:03:14.692 --> 01:03:18.215]  Go ahead and publish my comment.
[01:03:18.215 --> 01:03:25.320]  And go ahead and include a clip or maybe just a preview of the Dr. Gosnell movie.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.281]  How about that?
[01:03:26.281 --> 01:03:32.746]  The guy that was chopping up babies after they were born.
[01:03:32.746 --> 01:03:38.131]  I mean, where do you think Ambrosia is getting all this young blood?
[01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:40.513]  Where do you think people are getting adrenochrome
[01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:45.719]  On the black market.
[01:03:45.719 --> 01:03:53.724]  So there's your comment Newsweek right there.
[01:03:53.724 --> 01:03:56.005]  Go ahead and look it up for yourself folks.
[01:03:58.126 --> 01:04:00.067]  It's all real.
[01:04:00.067 --> 01:04:01.807]  Yeah, you don't want to believe it.
[01:04:01.807 --> 01:04:07.989]  Because we're supposed to be... We're supposed to be the most advanced civilization of all time, right?
[01:04:07.989 --> 01:04:10.009]  We don't engage in human sacrifice.
[01:04:10.009 --> 01:04:11.750]  That's for the ancients!
[01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:13.890]  No, we're still doing it.
[01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:17.591]  And there's a sick, twisted mentality at the top.
[01:04:17.591 --> 01:04:19.152]  They'll never admit to this.
[01:04:19.152 --> 01:04:20.832]  But it's all about depopulation.
[01:04:23.018 --> 01:04:30.446]  And I had another great revelation, and I'll get to this later, about why Bill Maher says that Middle America wishes they lived on the coast.
[01:04:30.446 --> 01:04:33.789]  It's literally the exact opposite.
[01:04:33.789 --> 01:04:40.676]  All of these progressive liberals that live in these hellholes that they've created, they are the ones that are jealous of Middle America.
[01:04:40.676 --> 01:04:43.018]  They're the ones jealous of Middle America's lifestyle.
[01:04:43.018 --> 01:04:45.201]  They're the ones jealous of us having strong families.
[01:04:45.201 --> 01:04:46.062]  That's them!
[01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:55.478]  And then they want to act like they're high and mighty and deny that there's any baby organ harvesting going on even though they know it's true!
[01:05:00.177 --> 01:05:03.238]  At its regular price, it's a little over $3.
[01:05:03.238 --> 01:05:06.379]  When we have it discounted, it's about $2.50 a piece.
[01:05:06.379 --> 01:05:12.102]  Comparable bars are between $5 and $7 a piece at Whole Foods.
[01:05:12.102 --> 01:05:13.502]  This is high-end.
[01:05:13.502 --> 01:05:16.743]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.
[01:05:16.743 --> 01:05:20.845]  You get them for $2.50 or so when you get it at the current launch discount.
[01:05:21.465 --> 01:05:30.357]  This took over a year to get the top manufacturer and developer in the country to get it all ready and to have the manufacturing line prepared and to make this.
[01:05:30.357 --> 01:05:32.780]  It's available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:33.181]  It's simple.
[01:05:33.181 --> 01:05:38.808]  You get the highest quality protein bars in two different flavors and you fund the war against the globalists.
[01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:41.671]  And the attempt that we're engaged in to take the country back.
[01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:42.592]  It's simple.
[01:05:42.592 --> 01:05:48.556]  Go shop with the good guys at InfoWarsStore.com and break the back of the globalists and get high quality, super discounts.
[01:05:48.556 --> 01:05:55.901]  Or keep shopping with Jeff Bezos and Amazon and keep going to Whole Foods that are actually funding the Washington Post and the globalists' attempt to destroy this country.
[01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:56.902]  It's that simple.
[01:05:56.902 --> 01:05:57.783]  InfoWarsLive.com
[01:06:06.844 --> 01:06:10.047]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[01:06:10.047 --> 01:06:16.292]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:21.457]  Ladies and gentlemen, when the government doesn't do its job, sometimes it's upon us to do it for ourselves.
[01:06:23.497 --> 01:06:31.360]  And sometimes it may feel or seem fruitless, but as I've said, even the smallest actions can have the biggest effects.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:45.765]  Now, Jacob Wool got banned from Twitter about 48 hours ago, and then we were all kind of, we've been lulled into this comfort zone where yes, we're all just getting banned for our political speech, but there's actually a next level to this.
[01:06:45.765 --> 01:06:46.986]  They banned Jacob Wool.
[01:06:48.157 --> 01:06:52.199]  And they chose this moment because he's about to expose Ilhan Omar, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:52.199 --> 01:06:52.979]  That's the truth here.
[01:06:52.979 --> 01:06:58.902]  Now, Jacob has a press conference coming up later this afternoon, but he joins us now.
[01:06:58.902 --> 01:07:08.926]  Jacob, first, just tell the audience why you went up to Minnesota and what people can expect from your press conference this afternoon.
[01:07:10.814 --> 01:07:13.875]  Well, Owen, we put out a petition to remove Ilhan Omar.
[01:07:13.875 --> 01:07:17.176]  She's made anti-Semitic remarks, but that's the least of the concerns.
[01:07:17.176 --> 01:07:25.759]  She's made anti-American remarks, anti-Christian remarks, just about everything you can imagine besides Islamicists, who she seems to love.
[01:07:25.759 --> 01:07:27.119]  She speaks to Islamic Relief.
[01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:28.580]  She's backed by CARE.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.120]  She's supported Hezbollah.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:37.943]  She called for ISIS terrorists to receive a more lenient sentence in a terror case, wrote a personal letter, and served as their character witness in a case.
[01:07:38.743 --> 01:07:40.404]  So she is a terror sympathizer.
[01:07:40.404 --> 01:07:41.445]  She's an anti-Semite.
[01:07:41.445 --> 01:07:43.126]  She's anti-American.
[01:07:43.126 --> 01:07:47.249]  And 200,000 Americans, almost as many as voted for her, agreed with us.
[01:07:47.249 --> 01:07:48.810]  So we said we got to do something about this.
[01:07:49.597 --> 01:08:15.872]  We put out fundraising emails, we put out periscopes, we crowdsourced an operation, and we brought a 12-man team of former military intelligence guys, Laura Loomer, one of the top investigative journalists in the country, myself, who does this in a political and corporate realm, and several others, Ali Alexander, who's on the show frequently, and we went up to Minnesota, and we just treated this like, you know what, the DHS isn't going to do their job, the FBI's not going to do their job here, so we're going to have to do it for them.
[01:08:16.553 --> 01:08:21.975]  And we went on the ground with the intent of figuring out, did Ilhan Omar marry her brother?
[01:08:21.975 --> 01:08:24.236]  In other words, she admitted to marrying this Elmi character.
[01:08:24.236 --> 01:08:27.237]  The question became, is that her brother?
[01:08:27.237 --> 01:08:37.521]  So we went there, we interviewed human sources, we made it happen, and today at 3pm we're going to present our findings in a very meticulous dossier at the Gaylord at CPAC.
[01:08:37.521 --> 01:08:38.762]  So it's going to be fantastic.
[01:08:39.383 --> 01:08:50.250]  Wow, so there's going to be a huge audience for this and the information is at jihadilhan.com, folks, and I imagine that that's where people can also find the live streams.
[01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:52.512]  Where can they find the live streams of this press conference?
[01:08:54.633 --> 01:09:01.198]  I'm on Right Side Broadcasting Network, RSBN, and I'm sure you guys are free to take the stream as well for folks that are watching InfoWars.
[01:09:01.198 --> 01:09:14.667]  You'd have to talk to them about that, and I'm sure it'll be on a variety of periscopes otherwise, but I'd support Right Side if you're going to watch something and don't watch one of these lefties' periscopes, because they're all there, all the fake news journalists, and they're going to try to be tossing this thing down.
[01:09:14.667 --> 01:09:17.409]  But we're going to be right there in the main lobby at CPAC.
[01:09:17.409 --> 01:09:23.153]  We'll lead a massive press conference, and we're going to go over the facts, and the Democrats are going to have to decide.
[01:09:23.653 --> 01:09:32.619]  Either yes, Ilhan Omar married her brother in a fraudulent scheme against the United States, and so she has to resign, or yes, she did that, but we're okay with it.
[01:09:32.619 --> 01:09:38.483]  That's the only choice left they're going to have from a messaging standpoint after we present our findings.
[01:09:38.483 --> 01:09:44.667]  And I have confirmed we will be airing your press conference here on the Alex Jones Show, folks, so we will be carrying that as well.
[01:09:44.667 --> 01:09:52.772]  And, you know, just to take a step back from this, Jacob, because you're going to be revealing really the gruesome details of this during the press conference, but just to take a step back,
[01:09:54.867 --> 01:10:00.751]  The Democrats, which were never officially, you know, involved with the Women's March.
[01:10:00.751 --> 01:10:05.614]  I mean, yes, obviously, they were involved, you know, through people speaking and the political agenda and everything.
[01:10:05.614 --> 01:10:11.838]  But, like, as far as directly funding or doing any sort of, you know, fundraising, they were never really involved in that.
[01:10:11.838 --> 01:10:18.783]  Well, this year, the DNC came out and made a statement disavowing the Women's March for its anti-Semitism.
[01:10:18.783 --> 01:10:24.487]  Now, obviously, that involves Linda Sarsour and her anti-Semitic remarks and her hate for America and Israel.
[01:10:25.347 --> 01:10:33.230]  But what I'm a little perturbed at here, it just shows you how the Democrats, they can't even think in multiple layers or multiple dimensions.
[01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.011]  It's just like they can only think on one path.
[01:10:35.011 --> 01:10:36.091]  It's like in a little box.
[01:10:36.091 --> 01:10:40.653]  It's like, uh-oh, here's Linda Sarsour, clearly anti-Semitic, hates Israel.
[01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:42.213]  We need to make a statement about this.
[01:10:42.213 --> 01:10:51.036]  There's a lot of Jewish Americans that vote for us, so we disavow, the DNC says we disavow, the Democrats disavow the Women's March for its anti-Semitism.
[01:10:51.036 --> 01:10:51.857]  But wait a second!
[01:10:52.697 --> 01:10:59.662]  If they're going to disavow the Women's March for Anti-Semitism, how come they haven't disavowed Ilhan Omar?
[01:10:59.662 --> 01:11:00.343]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:03.785]  I mean, she is as anti-Semitic as they come.
[01:11:03.785 --> 01:11:08.929]  She could be a featured speaker at a Hezbollah event, and she's refused to disavow that group, by the way.
[01:11:08.929 --> 01:11:11.171]  I mean, look, just last Saturday,
[01:11:11.889 --> 01:11:32.319]  Just last Saturday, while we were in Minnesota, in fact, she flew down to Tampa for the night, and she spoke to a group called Islamic Relief that's been sanctioned as a material supporter of terrorism, namely groups like ISIS and Hamas, alongside a gentleman, or let's not call him a gentleman, alongside an animal, who has called for all Jews to be genocided.
[01:11:32.319 --> 01:11:33.299]  Speaks right alongside him.
[01:11:33.299 --> 01:11:35.260]  Featured speakers list.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:37.161]  Oh, but nobody's calling him Hitler!
[01:11:39.021 --> 01:11:43.925]  No, Trump's the bad guy who's got Jewish grandchildren, Jewish children, you name it.
[01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:45.086]  He's the Hitler.
[01:11:45.086 --> 01:11:47.888]  Aaron Klein was on Michael Savage yesterday.
[01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:51.770]  He said Trump is basically Jewish!
[01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:52.771]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:11:52.771 --> 01:11:57.955]  I called him the first Jewish president, the first Zionist president, however people want to put it.
[01:11:57.955 --> 01:12:01.157]  And of course, when you expose Ilhan Omar, this is now a pattern.
[01:12:01.798 --> 01:12:04.819]  Laura Loomer comes out with bombshell reporting against Ilhan.
[01:12:04.819 --> 01:12:07.000]  Banned from Twitter after Care lobbies them.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.702]  Jacob Angles, who I know has been on this network, worked on Stop the Steal, works with Roger Stone.
[01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:15.983]  You know, Jacob Angles goes out and reports on Ilhan Omar.
[01:12:15.983 --> 01:12:17.704]  Banned, just this last week.
[01:12:17.704 --> 01:12:23.146]  And now, myself, and I was expecting this, I knew this would happen, and I told everybody, they're going to take me out of Twitter.
[01:12:23.146 --> 01:12:25.047]  It's a matter of time, but I'm going to go out with a bang.
[01:12:25.794 --> 01:12:30.817]  So my last tweet was announcing these findings that are coming out Thursday, coming out today at 3 p.m.
[01:12:30.817 --> 01:12:36.180]  now, and they banned me about two hours later and made up some excuse that I've run fake accounts.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:41.703]  I've only ran one account ever that wasn't, you know, an officially sanctioned individual or company account.
[01:12:41.703 --> 01:12:45.966]  It was an experiment account to see how people would support Howard Schultz.
[01:12:45.966 --> 01:12:49.468]  So this whole idea of running fake accounts, it's just insanity.
[01:12:49.468 --> 01:12:50.989]  They banned me because CARE lobbied them.
[01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:55.979]  Well that's just, the whole thing, I've learned this, I talked about this earlier.
[01:12:55.979 --> 01:13:00.067]  The left right now is engaged in a next level of mental illness.
[01:13:02.051 --> 01:13:05.092]  Is pathological perpetual projection.
[01:13:05.092 --> 01:13:06.053]  And so here's the thing.
[01:13:06.053 --> 01:13:10.195]  As if, first of all, as if you creating some side account is even some big deal.
[01:13:10.195 --> 01:13:14.417]  It's like, okay, I want to have an anonymous account or I want to have, you know, this account for posting this or whatever.
[01:13:14.417 --> 01:13:15.317]  A ton of people do that.
[01:13:15.317 --> 01:13:16.758]  It's perfectly normal.
[01:13:16.758 --> 01:13:19.019]  AOC's got 600,000 bots.
[01:13:19.019 --> 01:13:20.239]  But that's my point.
[01:13:20.239 --> 01:13:22.900]  They're the ones that actually make fake accounts.
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.342]  Like, they're the ones that actually do the whole botnet.
[01:13:26.342 --> 01:13:30.244]  I mean, they even admitted it during the Alabama race for the special election.
[01:13:30.244 --> 01:13:30.784]  They're like, oh,
[01:13:31.164 --> 01:13:34.566]  We tested all of these bots to see how they would influence the election.
[01:13:34.566 --> 01:13:36.987]  Wait a second, you're the ones complaining about it!
[01:13:36.987 --> 01:13:47.392]  So that's just them perpetually projecting, again, they're the ones that have the fake accounts, they're the ones that have all these fake followers, and they've actually learned something, and I just figured this out, I don't know what you know about this.
[01:13:48.208 --> 01:13:58.401]  They've now figured out how to algorithm these bots into making it appear to be real now, so when you audit their Twitter accounts, they don't actually show up.
[01:13:58.401 --> 01:13:59.783]  So they've got it all figured out.
[01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:03.988]  They've mastered the art of fake Twitter accounts, and then they say, oh yeah, you're fake.
[01:14:05.185 --> 01:14:11.988]  They have, and I'm going to be exposing probably this next, I've got this in motion, but they've got right here in D.C.
[01:14:11.988 --> 01:14:21.733]  where I'm sitting, down the street, multiple floors and multi-million dollar operations that make the Internet Research Agency look like a couple of buffoons.
[01:14:22.713 --> 01:14:25.635]  So, the Democrats have botnets galore.
[01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:31.778]  They needed an excuse to ban me, so they took one out-of-context quote from a USA Today article about me and said, sorry, we had to get rid of Jacob.
[01:14:31.778 --> 01:14:32.978]  We know the reality.
[01:14:32.978 --> 01:14:34.639]  CARA lobbied them, just like you did with Loomer.
[01:14:34.639 --> 01:14:37.660]  They won't admit this, but I'll figure it out and expose it one way or the other.
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.442]  CARA lobbied them, just like they lobby in every other case.
[01:14:40.442 --> 01:14:41.022]  But you know what?
[01:14:41.022 --> 01:14:41.502]  I get it.
[01:14:41.502 --> 01:14:48.886]  CARA has invested millions of dollars of resources into Ilhan Omar and other people like her, and now I'm about to make their investment go up in smoke.
[01:14:49.406 --> 01:14:52.469]  With this dossier, with these findings, with this investigation.
[01:14:52.469 --> 01:14:54.090]  So I understand why they want to stop me.
[01:14:54.090 --> 01:15:00.816]  I understand why they had private investigators care, you know, private investigators following us around in Minnesota.
[01:15:00.816 --> 01:15:01.556]  That's fine.
[01:15:01.556 --> 01:15:03.178]  But we're not going to stop.
[01:15:03.178 --> 01:15:06.300]  And just so they know, if they try anything, the report's coming out one way or the other.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:06.861]  It'll be dropped.
[01:15:06.861 --> 01:15:08.422]  We've got a dead man switch on this thing.
[01:15:08.422 --> 01:15:10.063]  So they're not going to stop it now.
[01:15:10.063 --> 01:15:14.047]  You know, I got to say, you know, Jacob, I don't know how old you are.
[01:15:14.047 --> 01:15:17.189]  I believe you're in your young 20s, right?
[01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.309]  I'm 21.
[01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:27.217]  I got to say, folks, look, you know, there's a lot of times where we can feel bad about America and feel like the future is, you know, is not looking good and desperate.
[01:15:27.217 --> 01:15:27.578]  But, you know.
[01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:32.854]  We have to be patient and realize the bigger picture here because, folks, let me tell you something.
[01:15:32.854 --> 01:15:39.297]  When I was Jacob's age, and you can see the talent and the drive, I was in sports media and that's everything I wanted to do.
[01:15:39.297 --> 01:15:41.518]  America is changing, folks.
[01:15:41.518 --> 01:15:42.599]  America is changing.
[01:15:42.599 --> 01:15:49.562]  The youth is done being distracted by Hollywood, being distracted by all the fake crap, being distracted by the bread and circus.
[01:15:49.562 --> 01:15:51.183]  They're fighting for America now, folks.
[01:15:51.183 --> 01:15:55.305]  I mean, we're just now seeing America coming back, and they're trying to stop it.
[01:15:57.165 --> 01:16:03.530]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:06.573]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.573 --> 01:16:12.497]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.497 --> 01:16:16.280]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.541]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.541 --> 01:16:18.883]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.883 --> 01:16:25.088]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:25.088 --> 01:16:26.529]  Available at Amazon Books.

[01:16:33.794 --> 01:16:36.636]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[01:17:04.575 --> 01:17:06.156]  But the symptoms are there.

[01:18:07.557 --> 01:18:16.581]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:26.644]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[01:18:36.008 --> 01:18:37.349]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:18:37.349 --> 01:18:38.509]  You must experience it.
[01:18:38.509 --> 01:18:40.470]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:18:40.470 --> 01:18:45.513]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:47.034]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:47.034 --> 01:18:48.515]  It lasts 10 hours.

[01:18:58.137 --> 01:19:07.423]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.423 --> 01:19:10.305]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.305 --> 01:19:16.349]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:17.029 --> 01:19:23.274]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.274 --> 01:19:29.579]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.579 --> 01:19:36.505]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:37.646 --> 01:19:39.268]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:24.642]  They don't want you to know who Ilhan Omar really is.
[01:20:24.642 --> 01:20:34.012]  And truth be told, ladies and gentlemen, the bigger picture here, if you don't want to get into the identity politics and stuff, which is not what I mean, the point is that
[01:20:36.127 --> 01:20:47.578]  Ilhan Omar is now in Congress and is a total disruptor, obstructionist, anti-American who just wants to get in and literally destroy the fabric of America, folks.
[01:20:47.578 --> 01:20:48.419]  That's what this is all about.
[01:20:48.419 --> 01:20:53.824]  There's a deep, intense hatred of America amongst folks like Ilhan Omar, okay?
[01:20:53.824 --> 01:21:00.050]  And so, whether she's wearing a hijab or marrying her brother or not, the woman hates this country.
[01:21:01.081 --> 01:21:02.664]  And fundamentally wants to change it.
[01:21:02.664 --> 01:21:08.913]  And that's why on the cover of Rolling Stone, you have the feature, the women shaping America's future.
[01:21:08.913 --> 01:21:09.334]  Really!
[01:21:09.334 --> 01:21:12.138]  A woman in a hijab, the symbol of women's oppression.
[01:21:12.961 --> 01:21:19.766]  Nancy Pelosi, who can't even think her way out of a cardboard box, a corrupt politician.
[01:21:19.766 --> 01:21:28.312]  Alexandria Cortez, who in the next 20 years wants to bulldoze all skyscrapers and wants to eliminate air travel.
[01:21:28.312 --> 01:21:30.414]  Oh, that's the future of America!
[01:21:30.414 --> 01:21:32.896]  No, that's a dystopian hellhole!
[01:21:33.797 --> 01:21:35.498]  But that's what they're pushing.
[01:21:35.498 --> 01:21:36.779]  That's who they really are.
[01:21:36.779 --> 01:21:41.222]  And anyone exposing that gets censored, like my guest Jacob Wool.
[01:21:41.222 --> 01:21:45.965]  So again, Jacob, major press conference coming up this afternoon.
[01:21:45.965 --> 01:21:48.866]  We're going to carry it here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:21:48.866 --> 01:21:56.171]  Just again, tell people what they can expect during this press conference, what time it's at, and what motivated your whole investigation.
[01:21:57.307 --> 01:22:13.080]  We put together a boots-on-the-ground investigation because we couldn't continue to see a situation where, on Saturday, this Congresswoman goes and speaks next to a guy who calls for genociding Jews and destroying America, and on Monday, she gets a classified briefing.
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.622]  Remember, folks, she's on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
[01:22:15.622 --> 01:22:17.924]  She gets briefed by the three-letter agencies.
[01:22:17.924 --> 01:22:20.406]  Meanwhile, she's called for abolishing DHS.
[01:22:20.406 --> 01:22:26.771]  Well, we're about to show a reason why she might want to abolish DHS and abolish ICE, because she engaged
[01:22:27.171 --> 01:22:35.726]  In a fraudulent immigration scheme, an illegal one, a felony, multiple felonies, with her own brother, married her own brother, legally speaking.
[01:22:35.726 --> 01:22:36.928]  We've got her dead to rights.
[01:22:36.928 --> 01:22:38.671]  That's what we're going to prove at 3 p.m.
[01:22:38.671 --> 01:22:39.553]  Eastern, 12 Pacific.
[01:22:40.877 --> 01:22:47.441]  And hopefully this leads the Democrats to, at least, I want her off of the Foreign Affairs Committee this afternoon.
[01:22:47.441 --> 01:22:50.002]  I don't want her getting another classified briefing.
[01:22:50.002 --> 01:22:55.825]  I don't want her interrogating another foreign affairs official like Elliott Abrams.
[01:22:55.825 --> 01:22:57.166]  This is out of control.
[01:22:57.166 --> 01:23:01.428]  You've got somebody who's called for abolishing ICE, abolishing DHS, and say whatever you want about DHS.
[01:23:01.428 --> 01:23:04.870]  They've done some bad things, and you guys have covered them, and I've talked about them.
[01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:08.252]  But overall, I think of DHS as the last line of defense.
[01:23:08.772 --> 01:23:10.654]  Wait, but Dirty Bob is going on in Los Angeles!
[01:23:27.842 --> 01:23:40.270]  We were told, face value here, again, September 11th, 2001, radical Islamic terrorists engaged in the biggest terror act on this country's homeland ever.
[01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:44.913]  3,000 Americans died that day, tens of thousands of Americans have died since in the aftermath, okay?
[01:23:44.913 --> 01:23:48.236]  Now, we're told that this is from radical Islamic terror.
[01:23:48.236 --> 01:23:55.140]  We went to war against radical Islamic terror, and as far as we're concerned, we're still at war with radical Islamic terror.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:57.062]  Now, here's Ilhan Omar,
[01:23:57.942 --> 01:24:05.011]  Which I think you could say is definitely, I mean, she's an islamicist, whether you want to call her radical or not, I guess that's your own opinion.
[01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:13.841]  But here she is, we're still in a war against radical Islam, and here she is saying she wants to abolish DHS?
[01:24:14.742 --> 01:24:21.047]  Again, if you just take that at face value, how is that not considered a terrorist threat?
[01:24:21.047 --> 01:24:29.034]  When we're at war with radical Islam, Islamic terrorists, here's an Islamist saying, I want to eliminate America's last line of defense.
[01:24:29.034 --> 01:24:36.080]  I mean, again, at face value, how does America not look at that and say, hmm, something doesn't add up here.
[01:24:37.523 --> 01:24:38.164]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:38.164 --> 01:24:40.185]  And some have called for abolishing ICE.
[01:24:40.185 --> 01:24:43.949]  She calls for abolishing the entire Department of Homeland Security.
[01:24:43.949 --> 01:24:45.490]  That means TSA.
[01:24:45.490 --> 01:24:52.036]  That means the folks at the ports that make sure people aren't shipping in cesium-137 or radiological material.
[01:24:52.036 --> 01:24:56.179]  She wants to abolish the whole thing and open up America to unlimited terror attacks.
[01:24:56.179 --> 01:25:00.283]  And I can tell you, having brought military intel guys with me, having dealt with
[01:25:00.763 --> 01:25:01.223]  We're good.
[01:25:20.976 --> 01:25:24.740]  DHS just spoiled 14 terror attacks in the past 12 months.
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:25.200]  I know.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.742]  Let's abolish DHS.
[01:25:26.742 --> 01:25:31.126]  That is subversive, anti-American behavior, and it's got to be stopped.
[01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:34.889]  She has got to be removed from that committee, and she has got to be removed from Congress.
[01:25:34.889 --> 01:25:37.872]  You cannot have somebody like that in the halls of power in this country.
[01:25:37.872 --> 01:25:38.693]  It's unacceptable.
[01:25:39.298 --> 01:25:43.701]  Well, and now you had the story out of Breitbart today.
[01:25:43.701 --> 01:25:47.945]  Travel ban ends nearly all immigration from terrorist-sanctioned nations.
[01:25:47.945 --> 01:25:53.969]  And then they actually have the studies and the numbers in here with the data that basically the travel ban does work.
[01:25:53.969 --> 01:25:55.831]  It stops terrorists from coming here.
[01:25:55.831 --> 01:25:58.813]  And again, they want to sit here and pin this thing on Trump.
[01:25:58.813 --> 01:26:00.555]  The list was actually created by Obama.
[01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:03.637]  These are just the eight countries Obama was bombing while he was in office.
[01:26:03.637 --> 01:26:07.140]  So it's like, wow, yeah, we were just bombing your country for eight years.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:10.664]  You don't think they might want to try to sneak someone in here to kill Americans?
[01:26:10.664 --> 01:26:11.705]  Of course they would!
[01:26:11.705 --> 01:26:13.166]  That's why we have this travel ban.
[01:26:13.166 --> 01:26:14.948]  That's why Trump re-signed it.
[01:26:14.948 --> 01:26:16.170]  And so it's like, yeah, here's the data.
[01:26:17.734 --> 01:26:24.359]  When we actually do our due diligence and try to stop terrorists from coming in, we can maybe stop terrorism or at least quell it.
[01:26:24.359 --> 01:26:28.121]  And then here's Ilhan Omar, who's trying to stop that whole process.
[01:26:28.121 --> 01:26:29.502]  Why isn't America asking why?
[01:26:29.502 --> 01:26:37.108]  So again, Jacob Wohl, he is hosting a press conference this afternoon, folks, and he's breaking down his research into Ilhan Omar.
[01:26:37.108 --> 01:26:38.789]  But we're kind of going beyond the pale here.
[01:26:39.369 --> 01:26:46.452]  You're just getting, you're trying to get a foot in the door for people's attention and just say, hey, look, we just investigated this woman.
[01:26:46.452 --> 01:26:47.832]  Did she marry her brother?
[01:26:47.832 --> 01:26:49.313]  Are you going to accept that?
[01:26:49.313 --> 01:26:50.553]  Are we going to accept that?
[01:26:50.553 --> 01:26:51.934]  Are we going to do something about it?
[01:26:51.934 --> 01:26:52.694]  Are you?
[01:26:52.694 --> 01:26:57.055]  And so basically you're putting the Democrats in a position where they have to make a decision on Ilhan Omar.
[01:26:57.055 --> 01:27:04.058]  Either you're going to accept her anti-Semitism and her and her felonious behavior, or you're going to deny it.
[01:27:05.917 --> 01:27:06.979]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:06.979 --> 01:27:14.648]  This woman is a felon, she's a terror sympathizer, she's an anti-Semite, she's an anti-American, and she has absolutely got to be removed from Congress.
[01:27:14.648 --> 01:27:19.234]  And you know, it's striking the way that the mainstream media quashed this story.
[01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:20.650]  It was clear.
[01:27:20.650 --> 01:27:27.312]  I mean, even Snopes, who would normally call this an anti-Islamic conspiracy theory, says the claim that she married her brother is unverified.
[01:27:27.312 --> 01:27:29.393]  Well, not after this afternoon at 3 p.m.
[01:27:29.393 --> 01:27:37.175]  at the Gaylord Plaza in CPAC, but they will have to now say confirmed, but they even say unverified, and they're left as probably a CIA operation.
[01:27:37.175 --> 01:27:48.179]  So, even they admit that she probably married her brother, but when they asked her, when the Associated Press, you know, the far-right Associated Press, asked her for a list of her siblings,
[01:27:48.974 --> 01:27:50.716]  She refused to provide it.
[01:27:50.716 --> 01:27:52.198]  And they said, you know what?
[01:27:52.198 --> 01:27:53.379]  That works for us.
[01:27:53.379 --> 01:27:54.320]  Story closed.
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:58.565]  She refused to provide a list of her siblings.
[01:27:58.565 --> 01:27:59.506]  It's remarkable.
[01:27:59.506 --> 01:28:00.607]  It's uncanny.
[01:28:00.607 --> 01:28:01.588]  Well, this is huge.
[01:28:01.588 --> 01:28:04.471]  And again, folks, we're going to be covering the press conference.
[01:28:04.471 --> 01:28:09.296]  And again, Jacob, I just say and because, you know, people, it's just like.
[01:28:10.501 --> 01:28:12.662]  Everybody has a role out there.
[01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:19.166]  And I'm just so inspired by the role that you're playing, the role that Ali is playing, the role that Cernovich... I mean, everybody.
[01:28:19.166 --> 01:28:21.907]  And it's like, people want to sit here and infight.
[01:28:21.907 --> 01:28:32.973]  It's like, as long as we're all punching the same enemy and we all have the true same motivation, which is just have freedom and prosperity in the West and have America survive, then I'm all on board.
[01:28:32.973 --> 01:28:34.994]  So folks, be sure to tune into this.
[01:28:34.994 --> 01:28:36.455]  Jacob, you're going to have just...
[01:28:37.495 --> 01:28:39.917]  Groundbreaking announcements with your investigation.
[01:28:39.917 --> 01:28:40.498]  Great work.
[01:28:40.498 --> 01:28:41.619]  We'll be airing it.
[01:28:41.619 --> 01:28:45.663]  Jihadilhan.com is the website where you can find all the information.
[01:28:45.663 --> 01:28:47.845]  Jacob Wold, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:28:47.845 --> 01:28:48.305]  Thank you.
[01:28:48.305 --> 01:28:49.766]  All right, there he goes, folks.
[01:28:49.766 --> 01:28:54.130]  We'll see him again in just a matter of time during this press conference.
[01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:55.832]  This is America waking up.
[01:28:57.469 --> 01:28:58.690]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.690 --> 01:29:02.612]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.612 --> 01:29:04.132]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.132 --> 01:29:07.094]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.094 --> 01:29:12.657]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.657 --> 01:29:13.857]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:13.857 --> 01:29:16.799]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.799 --> 01:29:19.020]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:23.462]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.462 --> 01:29:25.804]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.168 --> 01:29:33.813]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[01:29:33.813 --> 01:29:38.517]  Did you know the official national American flag has never been manufactured for retail stores?
[01:29:38.517 --> 01:29:40.819]  The one that Americans fought and died for.
[01:29:40.819 --> 01:29:43.621]  The one symbol that represents our Constitution.
[01:29:43.621 --> 01:29:47.063]  Now you can be a part of this great movement that's never been seen before.
[01:29:47.063 --> 01:29:48.985]  Together we'll recapture America.
[01:29:58.237 --> 01:30:00.179]  Patriots are on the go.
[01:30:00.179 --> 01:30:04.903]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[01:30:04.903 --> 01:30:14.991]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:30:14.991 --> 01:30:19.495]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[01:30:19.495 --> 01:30:22.398]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[01:30:23.038 --> 01:30:30.324]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar, no one can top that, and it funds Liberty and the fight against the Globalists.
[01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:33.586]  With 15 grams of protein and so much more, they're amazing.

[01:31:03.330 --> 01:31:12.257]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:31:12.257 --> 01:31:17.621]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:33:00.797 --> 01:33:09.441]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.441 --> 01:33:17.164]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:17.164 --> 01:33:19.805]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:33.951 --> 01:33:42.135]  I'm trying to figure out where I want to go from here as new information is continuing to come in.
[01:33:42.135 --> 01:33:49.980]  Sometimes there's anomalies or glitches in the Matrix.
[01:33:49.980 --> 01:34:01.406]  Where I think, I think that... It's like this weird thing where everyone is moving digital.
[01:34:02.867 --> 01:34:17.338]  And so then you have this comfort level with digital activism, but now that they're censoring digital activism and even eliminating digital activism, it's like forcing us into the real world, which is actually the solution.
[01:34:17.338 --> 01:34:25.845]  So it's like, they're actually giving us the solution to the problems that they're causing.
[01:34:25.845 --> 01:34:26.125]  It's like,
[01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:45.714]  Because I started the InfoWars Army immediately after they banned Alex Jones off everything, and now the InfoWars Army is basically its own, like, living, breathing, operating body of people that go out and do street activism and link up with fellow InfoWarriors.
[01:34:45.714 --> 01:34:50.238]  Then we have the InfoComms, which blows up now.
[01:34:50.238 --> 01:34:53.861]  InfoComms.org, where InfoWarriors go and communicate and organize events.
[01:34:56.055 --> 01:35:01.281]  And that was all because they banned us off the digital platform.
[01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:03.103]  And then you look at Jacob Bull.
[01:35:03.103 --> 01:35:06.066]  They ban him on Twitter.
[01:35:06.066 --> 01:35:06.947]  Doesn't stop him.
[01:35:06.947 --> 01:35:11.412]  He goes out into the physical world and engages in activism, engages in investigation.
[01:35:11.412 --> 01:35:15.256]  So it's like they had us in their web.
[01:35:17.935 --> 01:35:29.240]  Like a spider has us in its web, but because we were sitting there in the web, warning all the other flies buzzing around, hey, don't get caught in this web!
[01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.561]  They were like, okay, crap, we gotta release.
[01:35:31.561 --> 01:35:33.722]  We gotta release this one from our web.
[01:35:33.722 --> 01:35:35.143]  It's too smart.
[01:35:35.143 --> 01:35:37.984]  It's telling the other people we're trying to catch about us.
[01:35:37.984 --> 01:35:43.127]  So it then releases us, and then we just go out into the real world, and we're just buzzing around out there now.
[01:35:46.576 --> 01:35:52.520]  So, I just, I'm telling you, I can't quite put my finger on it yet.
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:58.605]  But we're really in the midst of a cultural sea change.
[01:35:58.605 --> 01:36:03.349]  And I think the reason why I can't put my finger on it yet is because I don't know where it ends.
[01:36:03.349 --> 01:36:07.452]  And that's because I don't even think where it ends exists yet.
[01:36:07.452 --> 01:36:10.053]  We're still building where it ends.
[01:36:10.053 --> 01:36:11.675]  We're still designing where it ends.
[01:36:11.675 --> 01:36:13.256]  We're still figuring out where it ends.
[01:36:16.641 --> 01:36:25.026]  But it doesn't end, it doesn't end the way the globalists want it to go.
[01:36:25.026 --> 01:36:36.192]  Because there's one thing about people in the West, even the average uninformed individual, they're fighters.
[01:36:36.192 --> 01:36:38.273]  They're fighters.
[01:36:38.273 --> 01:36:43.116]  And even now, even in this digital brainwashed age,
[01:36:45.259 --> 01:36:50.781]  Those instincts will still kick into gear.
[01:36:50.781 --> 01:36:57.344]  And it'll be just, the floodgates will open and it'll just be a rush.
[01:36:57.344 --> 01:37:08.008]  And it's the old saying, I can never quote it exactly, but it's like, nobody wants to be a patriot when the patriot is, you know, a scorned man.
[01:37:08.008 --> 01:37:11.450]  But when the price of being a patriot is, you know, cheap, everyone's a patriot.
[01:37:11.450 --> 01:37:12.690]  I'm totally butchering the quote.
[01:37:12.690 --> 01:37:13.590]  I don't know what it is.
[01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:14.731]  But that's like where we're at.
[01:37:16.414 --> 01:37:28.983]  Because see, once you've had everything, once you've had everything taken from you, you have no choice but to fight.
[01:37:28.983 --> 01:37:31.665]  You see how that works?
[01:37:31.665 --> 01:37:39.171]  And then once you realize that you'll have nothing left, you have no choice but to fight.
[01:37:39.171 --> 01:37:40.192]  And it's the old psychology.
[01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:43.952]  You're not even thinking about any of this stuff.
[01:37:43.952 --> 01:37:47.574]  You don't care about any of this stuff until it comes to your front door.
[01:37:47.574 --> 01:37:52.517]  And it's coming to more and more Americans' front doors.
[01:37:52.517 --> 01:37:58.981]  And again, I just look at a Jacob Wool, 21 years old, when I was 21, man, I thought I was so cool.
[01:37:58.981 --> 01:38:07.987]  I was hanging out with professional athletes and I was on NFL football fields and, you know, in baseball clubhouses and locker rooms and other stuff.
[01:38:07.987 --> 01:38:09.207]  Oh boy, I'm so cool.
[01:38:09.207 --> 01:38:09.588]  Look at me.
[01:38:10.822 --> 01:38:13.104]  What did that do for anybody?
[01:38:13.104 --> 01:38:14.204]  Nothing.
[01:38:14.204 --> 01:38:17.607]  Sure, it's cool.
[01:38:17.607 --> 01:38:25.992]  But what I'm seeing is more and more Americans are learning and finding out it's cool to actually try to change the world.
[01:38:25.992 --> 01:38:32.417]  It's cool to actually engage in something that's fulfilling, substantial, and has a lasting impact.
[01:38:35.495 --> 01:38:38.416]  So that's the knob that's turning right now.
[01:38:38.416 --> 01:38:42.576]  The heat is being turned up right now.
[01:38:42.576 --> 01:38:49.757]  And once it reaches a certain degree, American patriots like popcorn just start exploding out of the woodwork.
[01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:52.418]  And so they want to chill free speech.
[01:38:52.418 --> 01:38:53.898]  They want to chill the Second Amendment.
[01:38:53.898 --> 01:38:58.239]  They want to chill our ability to communicate because they want to turn that heat down.
[01:38:58.239 --> 01:39:02.760]  They don't want those colonels turning into popcorn.
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.720]  But it's inevitable, folks, because
[01:39:06.314 --> 01:39:16.325]  It was already designed by God billions of years ago, and it's probably already happened billions of times over.
[01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:23.473]  So, we're just sitting here, ancient technology created by God, experiencing this consciousness,
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.982]  And you have people that think that they're in control.
[01:39:27.982 --> 01:39:33.726]  It's kind of like how AOC and these Democrats think that they can control the climate.
[01:39:33.726 --> 01:39:38.810]  You think you're more powerful than the sun?
[01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:40.831]  Talk about the arrogance.
[01:39:40.831 --> 01:39:42.413]  And it's the same thing.
[01:39:42.413 --> 01:39:53.140]  You think you're more powerful than the being, the entity, whatever it is that created all of this?
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:54.021]  It's really outrageous.
[01:39:55.538 --> 01:39:59.261]  It's really mental illness.
[01:39:59.261 --> 01:40:01.402]  And that is what it is.
[01:40:01.402 --> 01:40:12.070]  If you think that you can control the climate, or you have more of an impact on the climate than the sun, you're a lunatic.
[01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:18.235]  If you really think you can control humanity and dictate everything on Earth, you're insane.
[01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:27.832]  But it's an age-old story, like I said, played out billions of times over.
[01:40:27.832 --> 01:40:32.693]  Now, I need to fuel our engines here at InfoWars.
[01:40:32.693 --> 01:40:37.995]  You know about the censorship we're engaged in, or that we're being engaged against us.
[01:40:37.995 --> 01:40:39.575]  We're not allowed to exist on social media.
[01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:40.015]  That's fine.
[01:40:40.015 --> 01:40:41.716]  We've got InfoWars.com slash show.
[01:40:42.998 --> 01:40:54.708]  They just make us the most brand broadcast in the West, we just become the Dark Knight, and people that were questioning who we are or not sure who we are then wonder who we are and then go check us out at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:40:54.708 --> 01:41:03.476]  We hope that's the process, but it does limit our ability to expand, which is the sad truth.
[01:41:03.476 --> 01:41:07.099]  But, we're trying, and with your support at InfoWarsTore.com,
[01:41:08.786 --> 01:41:12.407]  We will at least continue to blast through hyperspace here.
[01:41:12.407 --> 01:41:15.448]  So, in the break, you know, I didn't really have time for breakfast this morning.
[01:41:15.448 --> 01:41:17.189]  I just had a little fruit, so I'm a little hungry right now.
[01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:21.151]  So, in the break, I'm probably going to have an InfoWars Live protein bar.
[01:41:21.151 --> 01:41:30.094]  I probably don't need a double fudge brownie right now, but the good news is it's full of protein and fiber and all kinds of good ingredients there.
[01:41:30.094 --> 01:41:31.314]  Peanut butter, peanuts.
[01:41:31.314 --> 01:41:34.355]  It just happens to taste like a double fudge brownie.
[01:41:34.355 --> 01:41:35.416]  So, I'm going to feel guilty.
[01:41:36.351 --> 01:41:51.259]  When I eat my protein bar here in the break, because it feels like I'm eating a double fudge brownie from the local five-star restaurant here, but nope, it's actually just healthy, hearty ingredients, totally healthy, and it's just the best tasting protein bar I've ever had.
[01:41:51.259 --> 01:41:55.601]  So it's the Infowars Life Protein Bar, 15 grams of protein.
[01:41:55.601 --> 01:41:57.362]  I'm a big fan of the peanut butter chocolate.
[01:41:57.362 --> 01:42:02.285]  If you like coconut, you're going to love the Vanilla Coconut Protein Bar.
[01:42:03.025 --> 01:42:05.268]  But the peanut butter chocolate is the one for me.
[01:42:05.268 --> 01:42:09.672]  You get two boxes or more right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:09.672 --> 01:42:11.474]  It's 40% off.
[01:42:11.474 --> 01:42:20.803]  So if you're like me and you always have a box of protein bars in your pantry, it's time to replace that with the brand new InfoWars Life protein bar.
[01:42:20.803 --> 01:42:22.685]  I've already done that in my pantry.
[01:42:24.264 --> 01:42:26.385]  This is how you can support us at InfoWars.
[01:42:26.385 --> 01:42:27.726]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:42:27.726 --> 01:42:29.167]  We give you products that you want.
[01:42:29.167 --> 01:42:31.008]  We give you products that you need.
[01:42:31.008 --> 01:42:37.972]  Protein bars are one of the top selling things for just as a snack when you're on the go, as something to eat before and after the gym.
[01:42:37.972 --> 01:42:39.473]  So we sell it to you now.
[01:42:39.473 --> 01:42:44.676]  And with two boxes or more on your order, you will get 40% off right now.
[01:42:44.676 --> 01:42:46.417]  So it's the brand new InfoWars Life Protein Bar.
[01:42:46.417 --> 01:42:48.219]  I'm going to have one in the break.
[01:42:49.180 --> 01:42:53.269]  And come back, come back focused and energized.
[01:42:53.269 --> 01:42:54.351]  So don't go anywhere folks.
[01:42:54.351 --> 01:42:55.093]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:55.093 --> 01:42:55.594]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:06.618 --> 01:43:15.622]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:43:15.622 --> 01:43:25.705]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[01:43:25.705 --> 01:43:34.249]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[01:43:35.069 --> 01:43:36.409]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:43:36.409 --> 01:43:37.570]  You must experience it.
[01:43:37.570 --> 01:43:39.670]  It is a total game-changer.
[01:43:39.670 --> 01:43:44.571]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:43:44.571 --> 01:43:46.092]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:43:46.092 --> 01:43:47.572]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:43:47.572 --> 01:43:54.254]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:43:54.254 --> 01:43:55.754]  TurboForce at InforgedLife.com.
[01:43:57.196 --> 01:44:02.621]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:44:02.621 --> 01:44:04.402]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:44:04.402 --> 01:44:06.164]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[01:44:06.164 --> 01:44:08.005]  Now, I can make them strong.
[01:44:08.005 --> 01:44:09.647]  Now, I can instruct them.
[01:44:09.647 --> 01:44:11.388]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[01:44:11.388 --> 01:44:12.369]  But not once I'm gone.
[01:44:12.469 --> 01:44:17.612]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:44:17.612 --> 01:44:23.195]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:44:23.195 --> 01:44:26.837]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:44:26.837 --> 01:44:31.819]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:44:31.819 --> 01:44:38.623]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:44:38.683 --> 01:44:42.464]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:44:42.464 --> 01:44:50.106]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:44:50.106 --> 01:44:58.668]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:44:58.668 --> 01:45:03.589]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[01:45:04.864 --> 01:45:10.769]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[01:45:10.769 --> 01:45:12.390]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:12.890]  We stopped her.
[01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:15.072]  We got a nationalist in.
[01:45:15.072 --> 01:45:17.273]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[01:45:17.273 --> 01:45:19.015]  We are winning.
[01:45:19.015 --> 01:45:24.559]  But those of us who are at the very front line, at the tip of the spear, are under unprecedented attack.
[01:45:24.559 --> 01:45:29.643]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[01:45:29.643 --> 01:45:30.743]  This is about who wants it most.
[01:45:32.190 --> 01:45:35.732]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.
[01:45:35.732 --> 01:45:37.854]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[01:45:37.854 --> 01:45:41.076]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[01:45:41.076 --> 01:45:42.197]  It's that simple.
[01:45:42.197 --> 01:45:49.722]  Thousands of great products, whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InfoWorksShore.com.
[01:45:49.722 --> 01:45:55.606]  So please, go to InfoWorksShore.com today, look at all the great products, because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands.
[01:45:56.346 --> 01:45:57.848]  And your support is beyond critical.
[01:45:57.848 --> 01:45:58.128]  Thank you.
[01:46:13.416 --> 01:46:22.560]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:27.902]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:46:27.902 --> 01:46:30.203]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:46:30.203 --> 01:46:33.704]  MFORESTORE.com on MFORESELECT storable foods.
[01:46:33.704 --> 01:46:35.185]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:46:35.185 --> 01:46:39.167]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:46:39.167 --> 01:46:41.387]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:46:41.387 --> 01:46:42.468]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:46:42.928 --> 01:46:44.910]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:47.453]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:47.453 --> 01:46:52.458]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:46:52.458 --> 01:47:01.747]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:47:01.747 --> 01:47:04.390]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.329 --> 01:47:32.577]  You know, my only regret here is that I just don't have enough time to get to all the content that we have.
[01:47:32.577 --> 01:47:33.137]  I mean...
[01:47:37.512 --> 01:47:39.594]  I want to play the whole Project Veritas video.
[01:47:39.594 --> 01:47:41.716]  I simply won't have time because I promised.
[01:47:41.716 --> 01:47:42.857]  And we need to take your calls.
[01:47:42.857 --> 01:47:44.738]  I mean, I love hearing from the audience.
[01:47:44.738 --> 01:47:47.541]  I know you want to react to everything that happened yesterday.
[01:47:47.541 --> 01:47:51.844]  So I'm going to open up the phone lines and I'm going to dedicate the next hour to your phone calls.
[01:47:51.844 --> 01:47:57.189]  So that just means I'm preempting all of the clips from the Cohen testimony yesterday, which is fine.
[01:47:57.189 --> 01:48:01.373]  I mean, you know what the deal is, but there's powerful stuff in there.
[01:48:01.373 --> 01:48:04.715]  Quite frankly, I need to air and I'm just preempting it so we can take your calls.
[01:48:05.856 --> 01:48:16.842]  But, for example, Michael Cohen broke the law yesterday, either when he filed his documents or when he testified, because there were inconsistencies.
[01:48:16.842 --> 01:48:18.263]  Mark Meadows points that out.
[01:48:18.263 --> 01:48:21.264]  So I'm not going to be able to get to any of these clips.
[01:48:21.264 --> 01:48:26.247]  I'm not going to be able to get to any of the responses that were unbelievable in the mainstream media.
[01:48:26.247 --> 01:48:29.328]  I'm not going to be able to get to Trump calling the Cohen hearing a fake hearing.
[01:48:31.736 --> 01:48:33.277]  And then there's other clips I need to get to.
[01:48:33.277 --> 01:48:36.799]  Trump talking about the North Korea summit, how he had to walk away.
[01:48:36.799 --> 01:48:42.001]  I believe that this is basically China's doing.
[01:48:42.001 --> 01:48:45.583]  North Korea's always kind of been China's junkyard dog in a way.
[01:48:45.583 --> 01:48:54.668]  So my guess is this is, because Trump is in this very intense trade talks with China right now, so my guess is this is China yanking the leash on North Korea.
[01:48:55.922 --> 01:49:04.169]  And basically saying Trump's not giving us what we want on these trade deals so you're not going to have these peace talks and get anything done with Trump either.
[01:49:04.169 --> 01:49:07.632]  But that's just my geopolitical opinion on that.
[01:49:07.632 --> 01:49:14.257]  You've got Don Jr., maybe I'll try to get to this, talking about Alex Jones on Tucker Carlson.
[01:49:14.257 --> 01:49:16.139]  I mean, it's just so much news.
[01:49:16.139 --> 01:49:17.120]  I wanted to play the whole
[01:49:19.269 --> 01:49:23.992]  Really a documentary from Project Veritas talking about how Facebook is censoring conservatives.
[01:49:23.992 --> 01:49:24.872]  Won't have time for that.
[01:49:24.872 --> 01:49:28.515]  I mean, it's just like... It's crazy.
[01:49:28.515 --> 01:49:32.737]  You would think that four hours of the Alex Jones Show would be enough to get to all the material we have.
[01:49:32.737 --> 01:49:34.518]  It's not.
[01:49:34.518 --> 01:49:36.540]  It's not.
[01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:39.662]  Now, I will be hosting the third hour of the War Room.
[01:49:39.662 --> 01:49:41.463]  Maybe I can get some of that stuff, but here's what I'm gonna do.
[01:49:44.468 --> 01:49:47.690]  The crew is saying it's Pompeo and Bolton.
[01:49:47.690 --> 01:49:49.211]  You know, I don't know about that.
[01:49:49.211 --> 01:49:53.813]  I mean, Bolton maybe, because the guy wants war, but he's fighting for war in Venezuela right now.
[01:49:53.813 --> 01:49:56.134]  I mean, I don't think he's really fighting for war in North Korea.
[01:49:56.134 --> 01:50:04.319]  I think this is China basically saying, using North Korea as leverage in the trade talks.
[01:50:04.319 --> 01:50:06.640]  But hey, if you want to call in on that, I'll go ahead and put out the phone number.
[01:50:08.161 --> 01:50:10.903]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[01:50:10.903 --> 01:50:12.444]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[01:50:12.444 --> 01:50:15.746]  Your response to everything that has happened in the last 24 hours.
[01:50:15.746 --> 01:50:17.987]  The Kim Trump summit.
[01:50:17.987 --> 01:50:19.208]  The Cohen testimony.
[01:50:19.208 --> 01:50:21.850]  The Rogan podcast featuring Alex Jones.
[01:50:21.850 --> 01:50:23.291]  Those are the big ones.
[01:50:23.291 --> 01:50:24.231]  So go ahead.
[01:50:24.231 --> 01:50:25.312]  We'll open up the phone lines.
[01:50:25.312 --> 01:50:25.632]  1-877-789-ALEX.
[01:50:25.632 --> 01:50:28.354]  And I'm not going to say first-time callers.
[01:50:31.756 --> 01:50:37.078]  But if you're a regular caller, I just want to get some some new voices, some new people on today.
[01:50:37.078 --> 01:50:38.659]  So please respect that request.
[01:50:38.659 --> 01:50:39.919]  All right.
[01:50:39.919 --> 01:50:46.342]  Now, let me do a news blitz as the crew is aggregating your phone calls.
[01:50:46.342 --> 01:50:49.083]  So I'm just going to just pile drive through this news.
[01:50:52.102 --> 01:50:57.843]  Majority of Americans favor a border wall over Green New Deal.
[01:50:57.843 --> 01:51:00.664]  Wow, I gotta say, folks, I don't understand this.
[01:51:00.664 --> 01:51:08.266]  Why would Americans favor building something to protect this country instead of demolishing the whole country?
[01:51:08.266 --> 01:51:10.486]  I mean, really, I don't understand this.
[01:51:10.486 --> 01:51:16.307]  I mean, wouldn't you rather have the Green New Deal that calls for literally tearing down skyscrapers and destroying America?
[01:51:16.307 --> 01:51:17.788]  That'll cost us $93 trillion?
[01:51:19.986 --> 01:51:21.228]  And ending air traffic?
[01:51:21.228 --> 01:51:27.518]  I mean, I think that America really wants to destroy itself, not build a wall and protect itself.
[01:51:27.518 --> 01:51:28.900]  No, of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:30.323]  It's the exact opposite.
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:34.302]  Does he need a safe space?
[01:51:34.302 --> 01:51:38.405]  Acosta loses it after Hanoi Presser makes false claim about White House Press.
[01:51:38.405 --> 01:51:44.769]  So we've got another video of Jim the bitch Acosta whining and complaining.
[01:51:44.769 --> 01:51:46.230]  So here's the deal with this.
[01:51:46.230 --> 01:51:54.836]  All these media travel to Vietnam and they want the big video, they want the big hit, they want the big exclusive, they want the big clip, they want the big this, the big that.
[01:51:54.836 --> 01:51:59.500]  And Trump basically goes there and the media is not even an afterthought to him.
[01:52:00.180 --> 01:52:01.921]  I don't even think he gives a damn about the media.
[01:52:01.921 --> 01:52:07.224]  So he's not giving them the stuff that they want, and he's basically kind of just ignoring them.
[01:52:07.224 --> 01:52:13.408]  And so here's Acosta like, I traveled all the way to Vietnam, and the president won't even listen to me!
[01:52:13.408 --> 01:52:18.051]  It's like, dude, he doesn't care about you.
[01:52:18.051 --> 01:52:18.792]  You're a little bitch.
[01:52:20.438 --> 01:52:28.466]  We talked about the Penn State troopers being told they're not allowed to enforce the law if they pull over an illegal immigrant.
[01:52:28.466 --> 01:52:32.069]  So Penn State, Pennsylvania is now becoming a de facto sanctuary state.
[01:52:32.069 --> 01:52:33.671]  That's literally against the wall.
[01:52:33.671 --> 01:52:35.613]  All politicians involved with that belong in jail.
[01:52:35.613 --> 01:52:36.193]  I've read the U.S.
[01:52:36.193 --> 01:52:36.634]  Code.
[01:52:36.634 --> 01:52:39.617]  They're all breaking the law, folks.
[01:52:39.617 --> 01:52:42.900]  Ilhan Omar claims dictator Trump impeachment inevitable.
[01:52:47.631 --> 01:52:52.593]  Really excited for the press conference we'll be airing where Jacob Wool is going to expose Ilhan Omar.
[01:52:52.593 --> 01:52:55.615]  But here's the frustrating thing.
[01:52:55.615 --> 01:52:58.656]  We know who Ilhan Omar is.
[01:52:58.656 --> 01:53:02.958]  Where will there be any results?
[01:53:02.958 --> 01:53:12.843]  Will there be any action to remove this anti-American scum from office and these foreign affairs committees?
[01:53:15.106 --> 01:53:20.647]  House passes sweeping gun legislation to expand background checks to cover virtually all states.
[01:53:20.647 --> 01:53:26.429]  You know, this is a... I think there's real debate to be had here.
[01:53:26.429 --> 01:53:32.250]  If you're a purist, then shall not infringe is being infringed.
[01:53:32.250 --> 01:53:33.410]  But what are you going to do, folks?
[01:53:33.410 --> 01:53:36.711]  You've got psychotics in this country.
[01:53:36.711 --> 01:53:38.312]  And that's just the truth.
[01:53:38.312 --> 01:53:39.452]  You've got a bunch of pill heads.
[01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:41.949]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:53:41.949 --> 01:53:43.530]  I think this is a real debate.
[01:53:43.530 --> 01:53:46.132]  I'm not going to sit here and try to play one side or the other.
[01:53:46.132 --> 01:53:50.494]  You know where I fall in the Second Amendment.
[01:53:50.494 --> 01:53:58.738]  But part of the problem is, I think it just forces the left to go farther to the left when you're just like, oh yeah, no rules on guns.
[01:53:58.738 --> 01:54:00.379]  It's like, well no, wait a second.
[01:54:01.428 --> 01:54:09.052]  Let's have common sense when it comes to, hey, this guy has been put in jail for beating his wife on multiple occasions.
[01:54:09.052 --> 01:54:11.453]  He's made death threats to his neighbors.
[01:54:11.453 --> 01:54:13.034]  Okay, background check on him.
[01:54:13.034 --> 01:54:17.716]  Do we want him to have a gun?
[01:54:17.716 --> 01:54:21.218]  Trump and GOP promised economic growth much better than Obama's.
[01:54:21.218 --> 01:54:21.919]  That's not what happened.
[01:54:21.919 --> 01:54:23.759]  Well, this is fake news.
[01:54:23.759 --> 01:54:26.201]  This is the first quarter, though, where the
[01:54:27.176 --> 01:54:29.500]  The GDP growth did not reach 3%.
[01:54:29.500 --> 01:54:32.184]  Now keep in mind, these are early returns.
[01:54:32.184 --> 01:54:37.993]  That number could actually end up being higher than what they're first reporting.
[01:54:37.993 --> 01:54:40.217]  That seems to be how it's been in the past.
[01:54:41.181 --> 01:54:47.445]  Regardless, even if the GDP growth doesn't hit 3%, it'll be the first time it didn't for a quarter.
[01:54:47.445 --> 01:54:52.728]  It barely ever hit, I think it hit 3% for a quarter under Obama three or four times.
[01:54:52.728 --> 01:54:54.749]  For a year, zero times.
[01:54:54.749 --> 01:54:58.092]  So Trump's already beat Obama when it comes to economic growth.
[01:54:58.092 --> 01:55:01.934]  That's not even up for debate.
[01:55:01.934 --> 01:55:03.735]  Here's a scary one from CBS New York.
[01:55:06.158 --> 01:55:11.423]  MS-13 planning to target off-duty cops at their homes.
[01:55:11.423 --> 01:55:13.585]  Now ask yourself this.
[01:55:13.585 --> 01:55:22.072]  How would MS-13 get access to that type of personal information?
[01:55:22.072 --> 01:55:28.378]  How would MS-13 be able to get the home addresses of off-duty cops?
[01:55:28.378 --> 01:55:29.339]  Just ask yourself that.
[01:55:31.141 --> 01:55:35.082]  And ask yourself, what type of politician would allow this to happen?
[01:55:35.082 --> 01:55:44.844]  Well, this is New York, so you gotta look at Cuomo, you gotta look at de Blasio, you can throw Cortez in there, Schumer.
[01:55:44.844 --> 01:55:55.186]  Folks, if this starts happening, I mean, if MS-13 really is able to get the home addresses of off-duty New York police and start attacking them,
[01:55:57.318 --> 01:56:07.405]  I mean, this is like, folks, this could be next level stuff here because, again, ask yourself how they are getting that information.
[01:56:07.405 --> 01:56:17.411]  And if this goes to the top, and it's as corrupt as we think it is, you don't think for one second there's politicians that want good police dead?
[01:56:17.411 --> 01:56:26.157]  I mean, I don't need to get into too much of it, folks, but there's a lot going on behind the scenes in New York right now.
[01:56:27.469 --> 01:56:30.493]  And it's been going on.
[01:56:30.493 --> 01:56:38.443]  And the same brave men and women that made sure Anthony Weiner went to jail, it was not easy, folks.
[01:56:38.443 --> 01:56:39.724]  Trust me on that.
[01:56:39.724 --> 01:56:42.468]  It may have seemed like a clear and obvious case.
[01:56:42.468 --> 01:56:44.731]  You'd be surprised at how hard it is.
[01:56:46.255 --> 01:56:48.296]  Even when you have the actual evidence.
[01:56:48.296 --> 01:56:52.817]  That's the only reason why it went down is because the public got the evidence thanks to good men and women in the police.
[01:56:52.817 --> 01:57:05.201]  If you don't think for one second there's politicians that want to snuff out police officers that actually do their job and won't cover up for crimes at the very top, well, you're not living on planet Earth.
[01:57:05.201 --> 01:57:07.282]  So this is a scary one here, folks.
[01:57:07.282 --> 01:57:14.684]  And a lot of people say the reason why people want MS-13 in this country is so they can carry out their hits.
[01:57:17.122 --> 01:57:22.586]  Facebook Insider Leaks Documents Explains Deboosting, Troll Report, and Political Targeting in Video Interview.
[01:57:22.586 --> 01:57:26.430]  The full 20-minute video interview is on ProjectVeritas.com.
[01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:27.851]  It's bombshell, folks.
[01:57:27.851 --> 01:57:31.754]  And again, we told you this was going on before they even executed it.
[01:57:31.754 --> 01:57:36.197]  We told you they were engaged in social media censorship before they even engaged on it.
[01:57:36.197 --> 01:57:42.662]  InfoWars is tomorrow's news today, and that's why they ban us off social media.
[01:57:42.662 --> 01:57:45.525]  Not deboost us, deplatform us.
[01:57:47.438 --> 01:58:00.846]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:58:00.846 --> 01:58:11.892]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.128]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:58:15.128 --> 01:58:17.799]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:58:19.172 --> 01:58:23.493]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:58:23.493 --> 01:58:27.754]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:58:27.754 --> 01:58:30.034]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:58:30.034 --> 01:58:32.354]  This country is in a war!
[01:58:32.354 --> 01:58:43.036]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:58:43.036 --> 01:58:46.617]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:58:48.223 --> 01:58:49.884]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:58:49.884 --> 01:58:51.605]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:58:51.605 --> 01:58:53.126]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:58:53.126 --> 01:58:55.168]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:58:55.168 --> 01:59:00.071]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:59:00.071 --> 01:59:03.873]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:59:03.873 --> 01:59:11.939]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:59:12.859 --> 01:59:22.923]  I am patient zero in the massive banning, but you can override the censors now and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:59:22.923 --> 01:59:26.884]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:59:26.884 --> 01:59:32.826]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:59:32.826 --> 01:59:35.867]  Call and talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[01:59:35.867 --> 01:59:37.368]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:59:37.368 --> 01:59:40.409]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:59:43.682 --> 01:59:46.604]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:23.602 --> 02:00:27.444]  All right, I am going to go to the phone calls here in this hour.
[02:00:27.444 --> 02:00:30.646]  I do want to air a clip from Tucker Carlson last night.
[02:00:30.646 --> 02:00:48.595]  I'm not sure if I even want to mention this or not, but it's like InfoWars, because CPAC is going on right now, and it's like InfoWars is the fight club.
[02:00:48.595 --> 02:00:49.956]  And so here's what happens.
[02:00:51.482 --> 02:01:02.887]  And look, I'll just be honest with you folks, because I was explaining this to a friend of mine last night, who was asking me why I'm not at CPAC.
[02:01:02.887 --> 02:01:05.108]  I don't even know if I should get into this.
[02:01:05.108 --> 02:01:07.349]  In fact, I'm not even going to get into this, because it's just personal crap.
[02:01:07.349 --> 02:01:08.889]  I'm just babbling.
[02:01:08.889 --> 02:01:11.350]  But it's like, InfoWars is literally the Fight Club.
[02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:19.874]  So you've got all these conservatives right now at CPAC, and a lot of them are InfoWars listeners, probably tuned in right now, but they know
[02:01:20.871 --> 02:01:25.314]  With all these other conservatives around, like, they know, like, ooh, like, do I talk about Infowars?
[02:01:25.314 --> 02:01:26.455]  Do I talk about Alex Jones?
[02:01:26.455 --> 02:01:36.622]  Because there's really, really popular conservatives that are all high and mighty on themselves that get off on insulting Infowars and laughing at Infowars like we're some kind of joke.
[02:01:36.622 --> 02:01:46.970]  And so, it's just funny to me, with CPAC happening right now, and all these people wondering why I'm not there, it's just like,
[02:01:49.542 --> 02:01:59.069]  It's almost like I don't even want InfoWars to be present there because it almost divides, it almost puts a wedge into conservatives.
[02:01:59.069 --> 02:02:03.753]  Because you're going to have some of these mainline conservatives like, oh god, InfoWars is here?
[02:02:03.753 --> 02:02:04.974]  Gross.
[02:02:04.974 --> 02:02:08.917]  And then you're going to have most of the people like, yes, InfoWars, oh my gosh!
[02:02:09.807 --> 02:02:11.708]  And so it's like, I don't even want to be involved in that.
[02:02:11.708 --> 02:02:13.650]  And then just overall, like the whole D.C.
[02:02:13.650 --> 02:02:16.312]  thing, it's just like, it's like a social club.
[02:02:16.312 --> 02:02:17.172]  And I was explaining this to my friend.
[02:02:17.172 --> 02:02:18.273]  I was like, dude, if I was in D.C.
[02:02:18.273 --> 02:02:21.275]  right now, I'd have to be out and doing social things.
[02:02:21.275 --> 02:02:23.697]  And you can go on social media and see everybody was out last night in D.C.
[02:02:23.697 --> 02:02:24.398]  doing this stuff.
[02:02:24.398 --> 02:02:26.359]  Instead, I played basketball with my friends.
[02:02:26.359 --> 02:02:29.321]  And that's what I'd rather be doing, quite frankly, when I get off air.
[02:02:29.321 --> 02:02:31.443]  But here's Don Jr.
[02:02:31.443 --> 02:02:35.246]  on Tucker Carlson last night talking about the censorship on social media.
[02:02:38.729 --> 02:02:42.912]  So free speech doesn't mean anything if people can't hear you speak.
[02:02:42.912 --> 02:02:48.097]  And this alliance between the activist left and big corporations is preventing people from being heard.
[02:02:48.097 --> 02:02:50.879]  So it is, in effect, an attack on free speech.
[02:02:50.879 --> 02:02:53.721]  The media benefits from our freedom of speech.
[02:02:53.721 --> 02:02:55.883]  They are the prime beneficiaries of the First Amendment.
[02:02:55.883 --> 02:02:57.965]  And yet, they don't even cover it.
[02:02:57.965 --> 02:03:03.389]  And places like CNN actually encourage companies to de-platform voices they don't think should be heard.
[02:03:03.389 --> 02:03:04.770]  Yeah, they're like the arbiters.
[02:03:04.770 --> 02:03:06.431]  They're listening right now.
[02:03:06.431 --> 02:03:08.253]  Or maybe they don't listen anymore because they censored us.
[02:03:08.613 --> 02:03:12.275]  The majority of the press are now left-wing activists.
[02:03:12.275 --> 02:03:14.095]  They are on the side of that.
[02:03:14.095 --> 02:03:16.476]  That's what the 60 Minutes reporter said.
[02:03:16.476 --> 02:03:19.518]  They're not on the side that is being oppressed.
[02:03:19.518 --> 02:03:22.499]  You know, guys like me, again, I can do this because I have a big platform.
[02:03:22.499 --> 02:03:23.519]  I have a big soapbox.
[02:03:23.519 --> 02:03:24.320]  I can get it out there.
[02:03:24.320 --> 02:03:26.561]  But some of the little guys, they can't.
[02:03:26.561 --> 02:03:27.661]  They don't have that ability.
[02:03:27.661 --> 02:03:29.462]  They just end up taking it.
[02:03:29.462 --> 02:03:30.282]  And that's what's happened.
[02:03:30.282 --> 02:03:32.143]  You've never seen someone on the left
[02:03:32.643 --> 02:03:32.743]  It's
[02:03:48.439 --> 02:03:48.639]  I don't
[02:04:07.029 --> 02:04:11.853]  In 2016, he played monkey in the middle with the media and what they tried to do with messaging.
[02:04:11.853 --> 02:04:13.655]  He went right to his people.
[02:04:13.655 --> 02:04:16.898]  He went right to the people with his message.
[02:04:16.898 --> 02:04:18.520]  He didn't allow them to manipulate it.
[02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:20.022]  He went right over them.
[02:04:20.022 --> 02:04:28.250]  I think, to me, it reads as though they're trying to figure out how to minimize that ability again and let the media, which again, what, 93-94% left-wing activists at this point?
[02:04:31.161 --> 02:04:32.422]  Why do I get the feeling that Don Jr.
[02:04:32.422 --> 02:04:34.323]  would be the president we wanted Don Sr.
[02:04:34.323 --> 02:04:35.084]  to be?
[02:04:35.084 --> 02:04:36.265]  Why do I get that feeling?
[02:04:36.265 --> 02:04:37.085]  We'll take your call.
[02:05:05.623 --> 02:05:14.649]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:05:14.649 --> 02:05:24.736]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:05:24.736 --> 02:05:33.242]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:05:34.082 --> 02:05:35.423]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:05:35.423 --> 02:05:36.584]  You must experience it.
[02:05:36.584 --> 02:05:38.525]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:05:38.525 --> 02:05:43.588]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:05:43.588 --> 02:05:45.109]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:46.590]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[02:05:46.590 --> 02:05:53.275]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:05:53.275 --> 02:05:54.776]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:15.101]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:06:15.101 --> 02:06:17.182]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:17.182 --> 02:06:20.883]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:06:20.883 --> 02:06:37.228]  Alright, this was just handed to me, and I hope that everyone has the same instinctual reaction that I had when the producer handed this to me, who had the same reaction.
[02:06:41.209 --> 02:06:50.119]  A 10-year-old child pressured the Donald Duck comic book publisher into adding a gay couple into the next issue of the cartoon.
[02:06:50.119 --> 02:06:55.905]  Fennah, a girl with two lesbian mothers and two gay fathers... Wait, what?
[02:06:55.905 --> 02:07:00.850]  What the... ...complained about the lack of homosexuals in the Donald Duck comic book.
[02:07:01.846 --> 02:07:04.647]  And then this 10-year-old is apparently making statements.
[02:07:04.647 --> 02:07:09.929]  My parents are gays and lesbians and I think it's important that that's portrayed as normal too.
[02:07:09.929 --> 02:07:13.210]  But in Duck City, it looks like it does not exist at all.
[02:07:13.210 --> 02:07:15.331]  Who do you think prepared that statement for her?
[02:07:15.331 --> 02:07:16.191]  See, here's the thing.
[02:07:16.191 --> 02:07:17.972]  First of all, your instinctual reaction should be...
[02:07:18.872 --> 02:07:21.214]  Why is a 10-year-old even thinking about this?
[02:07:21.214 --> 02:07:22.576]  But then I realized it.
[02:07:22.576 --> 02:07:25.038]  The 10-year-old isn't thinking about this.
[02:07:25.038 --> 02:07:28.381]  The parents are making the 10-year-old think about this.
[02:07:28.381 --> 02:07:32.405]  And then, the parents are actually probably making these statements for the 10-year-old.
[02:07:32.405 --> 02:07:33.947]  This is actually a next six letters.
[02:07:33.947 --> 02:07:36.610]  See, this is why it's actually child abuse, folks.
[02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:36.870]  Now look.
[02:07:39.426 --> 02:07:50.110]  You can sit here and have a debate, if you want, on whether it's normal or abnormal to have two gay male fathers and two gay female mothers.
[02:07:50.110 --> 02:07:53.551]  I've never even heard of that, but fine.
[02:07:53.551 --> 02:07:59.833]  Folks, I'm sorry to say this, because it's the same thing.
[02:07:59.833 --> 02:08:01.614]  I'm not making a blanket statement.
[02:08:03.416 --> 02:08:07.378]  Who's ever raising this girl is mentally ill.
[02:08:07.378 --> 02:08:09.339]  And that's not because they're gay.
[02:08:09.339 --> 02:08:10.319]  They're mentally ill.
[02:08:10.319 --> 02:08:13.241]  It's a totally separate thing.
[02:08:13.241 --> 02:08:13.641]  So, like...
[02:08:15.290 --> 02:08:22.873]  They have become radicalized by their sexuality or whatever, and I guess they don't feel normal in society.
[02:08:22.873 --> 02:08:26.774]  I mean, okay, yeah, biologically you're supposed to be with the opposite sex.
[02:08:26.774 --> 02:08:29.675]  So, sorry, biology says you're abnormal.
[02:08:29.675 --> 02:08:31.156]  But society doesn't!
[02:08:31.156 --> 02:08:33.217]  But see, they can't accept that.
[02:08:33.217 --> 02:08:35.757]  They want their biology to be normal.
[02:08:35.757 --> 02:08:38.658]  That's why they want to erase the science of biology.
[02:08:38.658 --> 02:08:39.479]  So what you have here
[02:08:40.479 --> 02:08:53.448]  Is to radical, sexualized whatevers who are now using their daughter as a political pawn to make their abnormal behavior normal.
[02:08:53.448 --> 02:08:56.790]  To normalize that into society, folks.
[02:08:56.790 --> 02:09:05.456]  And I'm telling you, because of the politically correct culture, we are letting mentally ill people dictate our society now.
[02:09:05.456 --> 02:09:06.217]  That's what this is.
[02:09:07.321 --> 02:09:10.565]  That's why the left is able to go out and harass and assault Trump supporters.
[02:09:10.565 --> 02:09:12.187]  In fact, I got two news stories today.
[02:09:12.187 --> 02:09:13.288]  Happens every day now.
[02:09:13.288 --> 02:09:14.990]  Happens every damn day now.
[02:09:14.990 --> 02:09:21.618]  Black high school student attacks white peer over MAGA hat.
[02:09:21.618 --> 02:09:24.862]  81-year-old Trump supporter assaulted over his MAGA hat.
[02:09:25.796 --> 02:09:29.860]  Do you know why the left gets away with these hate crimes?
[02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:32.583]  Because they're mentally ill!
[02:09:32.583 --> 02:09:34.785]  And law enforcement knows it!
[02:09:34.785 --> 02:09:36.226]  And we even know it!
[02:09:36.226 --> 02:09:38.288]  That's why we let them do it to us!
[02:09:38.288 --> 02:09:41.712]  Because we know they're mentally ill!
[02:09:41.712 --> 02:09:43.314]  But once they start running society...
[02:09:44.346 --> 02:09:46.026]  What do you get, folks?
[02:09:46.026 --> 02:09:47.807]  A screwed up society.
[02:09:47.807 --> 02:09:49.587]  And that's all this is.
[02:09:49.587 --> 02:09:57.229]  Parents who have biologically abnormal lives trying to normalize that onto society.
[02:09:57.229 --> 02:10:01.730]  And because they're miserable in their own existence, they want everyone else to be confused and miserable.
[02:10:01.730 --> 02:10:08.271]  And I'm not making blanket statements, but that's how you get a 10-year-old saying, why isn't there a gay Donald Duck mommy?
[02:10:08.271 --> 02:10:10.112]  Or mommies and daddies?
[02:10:11.687 --> 02:10:12.627]  Has nothing to do with a 10-year-old?
[02:10:12.627 --> 02:10:14.248]  That's not a 10-year-old thought process.
[02:10:14.248 --> 02:10:15.949]  That's not a 10-year-old instinct.
[02:10:15.949 --> 02:10:22.152]  That's parents abusing their child, using their child as a political pawn.
[02:10:22.152 --> 02:10:22.992]  It's sick!
[02:10:22.992 --> 02:10:24.273]  It's mental illness, folks.
[02:10:24.273 --> 02:10:25.593]  It's mental depravity.
[02:10:25.593 --> 02:10:26.974]  That's who the left is.
[02:10:26.974 --> 02:10:28.694]  I promised I'd take your phone calls.
[02:10:28.694 --> 02:10:30.115]  That's where we're going now.
[02:10:30.115 --> 02:10:34.857]  Malcolm in New Mexico wants to comment on Alex with Joe Rogan.
[02:10:34.857 --> 02:10:37.058]  Go ahead, Malcolm.
[02:10:37.058 --> 02:10:38.719]  Hi Owen, great to talk to you.
[02:10:38.719 --> 02:10:40.059]  I've been a listener since 2004.
[02:10:41.832 --> 02:10:43.253]  I still have.
[02:10:43.253 --> 02:10:48.818]  I actually bought a hat from Alex Jones while I was at UT Austin, and I still wear it sometimes here.
[02:10:48.818 --> 02:10:56.525]  It's got 9-11 with an inside job on the back, and InfoWars in the front, and you ought to see the looks I get from limousine liberals here in Santa Fe.
[02:10:56.525 --> 02:10:59.288]  If I wore a MAGA hat here, I'd probably have a black eye.
[02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:07.334]  But anyway, let's talk about what Alex Jones said about Alistair Crowley during his Joe Rogan interview.
[02:11:07.334 --> 02:11:09.516]  First off, I'm a former initiate of OTO.
[02:11:09.516 --> 02:11:11.237]  I was a Minerval Degree Initiate.
[02:11:11.237 --> 02:11:17.362]  I lasted one month at OTO as Lodge Astrologer with them at ULIS Lodge in Atlanta.
[02:11:17.362 --> 02:11:18.503]  Now just say this again.
[02:11:18.503 --> 02:11:21.145]  You were with what?
[02:11:21.145 --> 02:11:27.389]  I was a Minerval Degree Initiate with OTO Lodge, ULIS Lodge in Atlanta, Georgia.
[02:11:27.389 --> 02:11:27.990]  And what is that?
[02:11:29.484 --> 02:11:40.009]  Uh, it was, it's one of the chapters of OTO, Oracle Temple Orientes, which was an organization started by Alistair Crowley and Jack Parsons in 1947.
[02:11:40.009 --> 02:11:44.611]  And Crow, uh, Alex Jones frequently quotes OTO a lot, I noticed.
[02:11:44.611 --> 02:11:47.192]  But anyway, um, he made a big error yesterday.
[02:11:47.192 --> 02:11:50.053]  I was listening to a Joe Rogan interview.
[02:11:50.053 --> 02:11:55.656]  Uh, first off, he said that, um, Alistair Crowley, and first off, his name is pronounced Crowley, not Crowley.
[02:11:55.656 --> 02:11:57.857]  I noticed everyone on InfoWars calls him Crowley.
[02:11:57.857 --> 02:11:58.457]  I think you guys
[02:11:59.111 --> 02:12:08.376]  Listen to Ozzy Osbourne too much, but I have to say this is the first Aleister Crowley Supporter I think we've ever had call in.
[02:12:08.376 --> 02:12:09.196]  I'm not hey.
[02:12:09.196 --> 02:12:09.356]  Hey.
[02:12:09.356 --> 02:12:12.838]  Hey, I'm not a supporter of him I would like I said, I lasted one month.
[02:12:12.838 --> 02:12:17.840]  I saw some things I did not want to see and I went through my membership from them.
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:25.984]  So I'm not a supporter Okay, okay, but he did but I did study with Ulysses Lodge I did study some of the literature of Crowley while I was there and
[02:12:26.670 --> 02:12:32.832]  Along with some astrology aspects, which I thought... Alright, so what did you disagree with first?
[02:12:32.832 --> 02:12:41.055]  Okay, first off, Alex Jones said that Aleister Crowley had a vision of a grey alien inside a pyramid of Egypt.
[02:12:41.055 --> 02:12:42.635]  That's not correct.
[02:12:42.635 --> 02:12:50.558]  Crowley saw Aiwass, which was a winged emissary of the Egyptian god Horus in the pyramid.
[02:12:50.558 --> 02:12:53.679]  What Crowley... What he was... What Alex Jones was referring to
[02:12:54.617 --> 02:13:04.294]  Aleister Crowley did a ritual and he saw a vision of what looked like a grey alien and Crowley called this grey alien LAM, but it was not inside the pyramids.
[02:13:04.981 --> 02:13:06.141]  As Alex Jones claimed.
[02:13:06.141 --> 02:13:08.162]  This was something completely outside.
[02:13:08.162 --> 02:13:09.222]  Okay, okay, alright.
[02:13:09.222 --> 02:13:09.822]  That's fine, Malcolm.
[02:13:09.822 --> 02:13:11.082]  I gotta be honest with you.
[02:13:11.082 --> 02:13:12.743]  I'm not trying to be disrespectful here.
[02:13:12.743 --> 02:13:16.404]  Just quite frankly, I don't think the audience cares so much about that.
[02:13:16.404 --> 02:13:25.986]  What I do think we care about, which I am interested in, what is it that you saw and experienced for that month that you were in the Crowley Group?
[02:13:27.797 --> 02:13:36.942]  Okay, I'll tell you, if you've got time, Alex Jones would love hearing this because it has a lot to do with the word Jesus, okay?
[02:13:36.942 --> 02:13:48.307]  Anyway, when I was initiated, the moment that they made their pronouncement, I saw the person, the lodgemaster, whatever, his face turned into a very outrageous color.
[02:13:48.307 --> 02:13:49.948]  Something came outside and it looked
[02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:52.249]  Like, I guess you could say a demon.
[02:13:52.249 --> 02:13:55.870]  Something out of the... I just want to be clear on something.
[02:13:55.870 --> 02:13:58.690]  Is there a hallucinogen involved in this?
[02:13:58.690 --> 02:13:59.771]  Are there any drugs involved in this?
[02:13:59.771 --> 02:14:02.051]  Are you saying you're sober and this is happening?
[02:14:02.051 --> 02:14:03.391]  I was straight as a board.
[02:14:03.391 --> 02:14:04.551]  Absolutely.
[02:14:04.551 --> 02:14:05.592]  I was straight as a board.
[02:14:05.592 --> 02:14:08.292]  There was no hallucinogens.
[02:14:08.292 --> 02:14:13.413]  But when I was initiated to my Minerva degree, like I said, Lodge Master made his pronouncement.
[02:14:13.413 --> 02:14:18.614]  When he did, he turned like a different color and this color came outside and it looked like something
[02:14:19.221 --> 02:14:21.523]  Like something from another dimension.
[02:14:21.523 --> 02:14:25.205]  It looked like it tried to enter me, but it could not enter me for some reason.
[02:14:25.205 --> 02:14:28.248]  It was trying to enter me and it couldn't.
[02:14:28.248 --> 02:14:29.809]  The theory goes you have to accept it.
[02:14:29.809 --> 02:14:33.872]  There has to be a metaphysical consciousness of acceptance.
[02:14:33.872 --> 02:14:35.953]  Oh yeah, but then here's the thing.
[02:14:35.953 --> 02:14:37.274]  Here's what you'll probably get a kick out of.
[02:14:37.274 --> 02:14:39.736]  I know Alex Jones will get a kick out of this.
[02:14:39.736 --> 02:14:44.079]  Later on I was dating someone who also left the watch because I mean there was a lot of craziness going on.
[02:14:44.079 --> 02:14:44.860]  A lot of really
[02:14:45.595 --> 02:14:50.859]  You know, it was not the contemporary agnostic Egyptian mass that we were into anymore.
[02:14:50.859 --> 02:14:53.841]  I mean, they were into some very serious, dark practices.
[02:14:53.841 --> 02:14:55.202]  Well, and that's the thing that I think, too.
[02:14:55.202 --> 02:15:05.769]  I think a lot of people get into this stuff maybe as an entertainment value or a curiosity value, and then they see it firsthand and they're like, whoa, these people are serious!
[02:15:05.769 --> 02:15:11.373]  Well, another person I know, another woman I know left, and I told her what I saw when it was initiated.
[02:15:11.866 --> 02:15:23.055]  And she was sleeping that night at, the lodge was like, also part of like a house in Atlanta, and she said that she saw, what I described to her, she, her eyes just lit up, she said, I saw exactly what you were talking about.
[02:15:23.055 --> 02:15:26.418]  Alright, so this is why this stuff gets so crazy, but I got 30 seconds left.
[02:15:26.418 --> 02:15:33.244]  I just want to ask you this, when, did, how much of this, like, compares to spirit cookings, or what we know and hear about spirit cookings?
[02:15:34.022 --> 02:15:37.264]  Uh, it was nothing, but let me just finish this real quick.
[02:15:37.264 --> 02:15:40.205]  So anyway, she said this thing was trying to rape her.
[02:15:40.205 --> 02:15:43.987]  And she called out, I command you in the name of Jesus to get out of here.
[02:15:43.987 --> 02:15:46.068]  And she said the thing backed off and disappeared.
[02:15:46.068 --> 02:15:48.529]  I was like, wow, that actually worked?
[02:15:48.529 --> 02:15:49.069]  And she said, yeah.
[02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.530]  I said, well.
[02:15:49.530 --> 02:15:51.291]  Well, that's why they fear Jesus.
[02:15:51.291 --> 02:15:53.111]  That's why they fear Jesus, these cultists.
[02:15:53.111 --> 02:15:54.032]  Hey, thanks for the call, Malcolm.

[02:17:24.502 --> 02:17:30.845]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:30.845 --> 02:17:33.887]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:33.887 --> 02:17:39.810]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.810 --> 02:17:43.612]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.612 --> 02:17:44.873]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:44.873 --> 02:17:46.214]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.214 --> 02:17:52.417]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[02:18:56.161 --> 02:19:04.548]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.548 --> 02:19:06.009]  Believe me, I know.
[02:19:06.009 --> 02:19:10.313]  I spend hours in front of a screen, and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.313 --> 02:19:13.796]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com,

[02:19:15.958 --> 02:19:36.114]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:19:59.235 --> 02:20:01.878]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:12.926 --> 02:20:29.358]  Alright, two things I need to mention here before we go back out to your phone calls.
[02:20:29.358 --> 02:20:33.361]  So, there is power in the name of Jesus.
[02:20:33.361 --> 02:20:34.942]  It is the name above all names.
[02:20:34.942 --> 02:20:36.123]  It's biblical.
[02:20:36.123 --> 02:20:37.244]  And you know, here's the thing too.
[02:20:37.244 --> 02:20:37.484]  It's like,
[02:20:38.985 --> 02:20:44.986]  It's really just... I should just stop now before I start going off on this jag and talk about it.
[02:20:44.986 --> 02:20:49.107]  But the name of Jesus is under attack right now.
[02:20:49.107 --> 02:20:53.248]  And it's not just them wanting to censor conservatives or Christians and demonizing them.
[02:20:53.248 --> 02:20:57.249]  They're actually trying to say, oh no, it's not actually Jesus.
[02:20:57.249 --> 02:21:01.989]  The real name is Yahweh or the real name is Yeshua.
[02:21:01.989 --> 02:21:04.530]  And so it's all this crap.
[02:21:06.007 --> 02:21:14.633]  To remove the power of the name Jesus from Earth.
[02:21:14.633 --> 02:21:18.796]  And so, just understand folks, I mean, you heard the last caller.
[02:21:18.796 --> 02:21:24.480]  I really don't want to get off into a jag, but Jesus is real.
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:25.701]  Lucifer is real.
[02:21:25.701 --> 02:21:32.285]  God, the creator of all that is seen and unseen, is real.
[02:21:32.285 --> 02:21:33.466]  And it's really sick
[02:21:35.302 --> 02:21:39.408]  This will be my final statement on this and I promise I'll move on.
[02:21:39.408 --> 02:21:44.735]  The elites know all of this is real.
[02:21:44.735 --> 02:21:48.600]  And the sickest thing about it is how they push the
[02:21:50.006 --> 02:21:51.647]  Atheist agenda.
[02:21:51.647 --> 02:21:53.909]  How the elites pretend to be atheists.
[02:21:53.909 --> 02:22:01.715]  How they pretend like evolution is a real thing and we evolved from, you know, a squirrel humping a monkey or something.
[02:22:01.715 --> 02:22:03.716]  They know it's all bullcrap.
[02:22:03.716 --> 02:22:10.682]  That's what the biggest secret, the biggest secret, which we already know, but the elites don't want you to know.
[02:22:10.682 --> 02:22:12.583]  This is the biggest secret, folks.
[02:22:12.583 --> 02:22:16.326]  You were literally created by God.
[02:22:16.326 --> 02:22:17.707]  Divine creation.
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:26.985]  In the middle of something that we cannot even comprehend, yet here we are.
[02:22:26.985 --> 02:22:29.107]  That's the big secret they don't want you to know.
[02:22:29.107 --> 02:22:35.672]  That's why they push evolution, and that's why all the elites pretend to be atheists.
[02:22:35.672 --> 02:22:37.693]  They're not!
[02:22:37.693 --> 02:22:38.874]  They're not.
[02:22:38.874 --> 02:22:42.297]  They just don't want you to have the power of God.
[02:22:42.297 --> 02:22:45.299]  They don't want you to have the protection of Jesus.
[02:22:45.299 --> 02:22:49.603]  Now, Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan
[02:22:50.905 --> 02:23:05.657]  Have just submitted a request to the Attorney General William Barr that Michael Cohen now face perjury charges for his testimony.
[02:23:05.657 --> 02:23:08.579]  And here's the problem.
[02:23:08.579 --> 02:23:10.901]  They have the documents.
[02:23:10.901 --> 02:23:17.086]  Mark Meadows literally has the documents, and I forget the exact details of this, and maybe I should just play the clip, actually.
[02:23:19.619 --> 02:23:23.042]  Let's go ahead and do it because this is breaking news.
[02:23:23.042 --> 02:23:28.747]  And I just want to make sure that we have this story locked down before we move on.
[02:23:28.747 --> 02:23:31.869]  Guys, let's roll clip 13.
[02:23:31.869 --> 02:23:33.591]  So this is from yesterday.
[02:23:33.591 --> 02:23:42.318]  And now Meadows and Jordan have actually filed a request to William Barr because of the perjury that Cohen engaged in yesterday.
[02:23:42.318 --> 02:23:45.220]  Guys, roll clip.
[02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:46.101]  I already lost my mind.
[02:23:46.101 --> 02:23:46.502]  Roll clip 13.
[02:23:48.616 --> 02:24:01.665]  Mr. Cohen, I'm going to come back to the question I asked before with regards to your false statement that you submitted to Congress.
[02:24:02.916 --> 02:24:09.558]  On here, it was very clear that it asked for contracts with foreign entities over the last two years.
[02:24:09.558 --> 02:24:18.780]  Have you had any foreign contract with foreign entities, whether it's Navarres or the Korean Air Line or Kazakhstan BTA Bank?
[02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:21.481]  Your testimony earlier said that you had contracts with them.
[02:24:23.061 --> 02:24:25.282]  In fact, you went into detail on the contract.
[02:24:25.282 --> 02:24:28.784]  In your testimony, I'm not asking about lobbying, Mr. Cohen.
[02:24:28.784 --> 02:24:30.564]  I'm saying, do you have foreign contracts?
[02:24:30.564 --> 02:24:31.825]  Do you have foreign contracts?
[02:24:31.825 --> 02:24:35.366]  Did you have foreign contracts over the last two years?
[02:24:35.366 --> 02:24:36.507]  Foreign contracts.
[02:24:45.959 --> 02:24:48.420]  Contracts with foreign entities.
[02:24:48.420 --> 02:24:49.721]  Did you have contracts?
[02:24:49.721 --> 02:24:50.141]  Yes.
[02:24:50.141 --> 02:24:50.641]  Yes.
[02:24:50.641 --> 02:24:52.162]  Why didn't you put them on the form?
[02:24:52.162 --> 02:24:56.264]  It says it's a criminal offense to not put them on this form for the last two years.
[02:24:56.264 --> 02:24:57.545]  Why did you not do that?
[02:24:57.545 --> 02:25:03.147]  Because those foreign companies that you're referring to are not government companies.
[02:25:03.147 --> 02:25:05.469]  It says non-governmental, Mr. Cohen.
[02:25:05.469 --> 02:25:06.289]  You signed it.
[02:25:06.289 --> 02:25:08.050]  They're talking about me as being non-governmental.
[02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:10.752]  And right, it says foreign agency.
[02:25:10.752 --> 02:25:12.113]  It says foreign contracts.
[02:25:12.113 --> 02:25:14.755]  Do you want us to read it to you?
[02:25:14.755 --> 02:25:19.018]  I read it and it was reviewed by my counsel and I am a non-government employee.
[02:25:19.018 --> 02:25:21.159]  It was not lobbying and they are not foreign.
[02:25:21.159 --> 02:25:23.200]  This has nothing to do with lobbying!
[02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:28.504]  It says it's a criminal offense to not list all your foreign contracts.
[02:25:28.504 --> 02:25:29.245]  That's what it says.
[02:25:31.411 --> 02:25:39.555]  Well then I'm going to take a look at it before I leave and hopefully I will amend it prior to leaving because that's not the way I read your document.
[02:25:39.555 --> 02:25:43.416]  Yeah, you'll take a look at it, alright.
[02:25:43.416 --> 02:25:50.459]  A known liar, a convicted liar, continues to lie and now faces perjury charges.
[02:25:50.459 --> 02:25:53.561]  Keith in North Carolina wants to talk about this.
[02:25:53.561 --> 02:25:55.161]  Go ahead, Keith.
[02:25:55.161 --> 02:25:56.282]  Owen, how are you?
[02:25:56.282 --> 02:25:59.223]  Long time listener, started listening in 2002, first time caller.
[02:26:00.271 --> 02:26:01.833]  I'm a big fan of your Young Jivity.
[02:26:01.833 --> 02:26:03.494]  Been on that for three years on a roll.
[02:26:03.494 --> 02:26:04.295]  All the good stuff.
[02:26:04.295 --> 02:26:05.236]  I appreciate all that.
[02:26:05.236 --> 02:26:06.637]  Well, we appreciate your support, Keith.
[02:26:06.637 --> 02:26:08.098]  Thank you.
[02:26:08.098 --> 02:26:08.919]  Absolutely.
[02:26:08.919 --> 02:26:15.125]  Been listening to Alex and even before, I think I picked up on him and Glenn Beck around the same time about, you know, around the same time after 9-11.
[02:26:15.125 --> 02:26:25.875]  So anyway, picked up on TV, watched the testimony, and I happened to tune in right when Debbie Wasserman Schultz was, I guess, asking some questions on Cohen.
[02:26:26.573 --> 02:26:31.056]  And it reminded me of, hey, you know, we haven't heard from the Owan Brothers lately.
[02:26:31.056 --> 02:26:31.476]  Remember that?
[02:26:31.476 --> 02:26:38.401]  No, actually, Luke Rosiak just published his book, which is his final report on his investigation in the Owan Brothers.
[02:26:38.401 --> 02:26:40.842]  I mean, it's blatant criminal activity.
[02:26:40.842 --> 02:26:41.623]  Pay for play.
[02:26:41.623 --> 02:26:45.806]  I mean, it's really unbelievable how the Democrats get away with this crap.
[02:26:45.806 --> 02:26:47.547]  I really can't even figure it out, honestly.
[02:26:48.567 --> 02:26:52.590]  And yet there she is, right, with some kind of authority, you know, representing the American public.
[02:26:52.590 --> 02:26:53.651]  Oh, and that arrogance, too.
[02:26:53.651 --> 02:26:55.833]  I mean, just the pompous arrogance of this bitch.
[02:26:55.833 --> 02:26:56.794]  Excuse me.
[02:26:56.794 --> 02:26:57.414]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:26:57.414 --> 02:26:59.276]  No, no, that made me think of that.
[02:26:59.276 --> 02:27:01.878]  But then it made me think, you know, taking us to a higher level up.
[02:27:01.878 --> 02:27:04.020]  And that's one of the things I think I really appreciate you guys.
[02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:12.386]  You guys really, I think, kind of try to get to the source and not always just describe the symptoms and the corruption, but maybe, you know, take it all the way up to where it comes from.
[02:27:12.386 --> 02:27:15.509]  But it made me think about the whole Rosenstein debacle with Trump.
[02:27:16.281 --> 02:27:19.682]  Uh, and I wanted to ask you if this is how you remember this.
[02:27:19.682 --> 02:27:32.305]  If I'm not mistaken, when everything was playing out and Comey was doing his thing and, you know, um, if I wasn't mistaken, I thought I heard or read an article saying it was actually Rod Rosenstein that was advising the president to fire Comey.
[02:27:32.305 --> 02:27:33.525]  Yes, that is true.
[02:27:33.525 --> 02:27:38.686]  Rosenstein suggested Mueller hired and he suggested Comey fired.
[02:27:38.686 --> 02:27:39.066]  Correct.
[02:27:39.066 --> 02:27:39.346]  Okay.
[02:27:39.346 --> 02:27:39.667]  Okay.
[02:27:39.667 --> 02:27:41.147]  So I'm on the right page now.
[02:27:41.147 --> 02:27:43.167]  Now, now add on to that.
[02:27:43.167 --> 02:27:45.588]  Um, what's the guy McCabe going around making his rounds?
[02:27:46.127 --> 02:27:58.830]  And I was watching that interview and I'm listening to him saying, oh yeah, you know, Rosenstein, as soon as he was appointed, whatever, he started mobilizing and getting together a panel of people to go after Trump.
[02:27:58.830 --> 02:27:59.590]  Right?
[02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.950]  Yes.
[02:27:59.950 --> 02:28:04.531]  And obviously these people, you know, assume none of us have memories, you know, I can't connect the dots.
[02:28:04.531 --> 02:28:13.153]  But basically what he said is about the same time Rod is advising Trump to fire Mueller on the other side of his mouth, he's already putting together a panel of impeachers.
[02:28:14.969 --> 02:28:16.110]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:28:16.110 --> 02:28:17.110]  And I think you misspoke there.
[02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:19.271]  You meant fire Comey, right?
[02:28:19.271 --> 02:28:19.932]  Yes, I'm sorry.
[02:28:19.932 --> 02:28:20.672]  Fire Comey.
[02:28:20.672 --> 02:28:21.893]  Yeah.
[02:28:21.893 --> 02:28:23.794]  Well, it's all a big con game.
[02:28:23.794 --> 02:28:29.537]  It's kind of like Wasserman Schultz up there posing arrogantly when she knows that she's a criminal.
[02:28:29.537 --> 02:28:31.378]  But it's all about the Confidence Act.
[02:28:31.378 --> 02:28:32.679]  It's all about the Confidence Act.
[02:28:32.679 --> 02:28:36.681]  So it's like, oh yeah, oh, Mr. President, fire Jim Comey.
[02:28:36.681 --> 02:28:37.561]  He's out to get you.
[02:28:37.561 --> 02:28:38.382]  He's no good.
[02:28:39.318 --> 02:28:40.860]  And then, but what is he really doing?
[02:28:40.860 --> 02:28:43.322]  He's actually working on removing you from office.
[02:28:43.322 --> 02:28:47.847]  So it's just this, it's a big con game with these people.
[02:28:47.847 --> 02:28:50.329]  From Wasserman Schultz to Rosenstein.
[02:28:50.329 --> 02:28:52.752]  They're just, they're just all a bunch of con men.

[02:33:07.695 --> 02:33:09.876]  I've been everywhere, man.
[02:33:09.876 --> 02:33:11.936]  I've been everywhere, man.
[02:33:11.936 --> 02:33:13.977]  Crossed the deserts bare, man.
[02:33:13.977 --> 02:33:15.957]  I breathed the mountain air, man.
[02:33:15.957 --> 02:33:19.238]  Alright, we're gonna go to your phone calls here.
[02:33:19.238 --> 02:33:22.919]  But first, couple things to highlight here.
[02:33:22.919 --> 02:33:30.681]  Michelle Malkin is now being warned by Twitter to seek legal counsel because she violated Pakistani law.
[02:33:30.681 --> 02:33:33.002]  Michelle Malkin lives in America?
[02:33:35.791 --> 02:33:42.498]  So apparently Twitter now is Pakistani law enforcement and we're going to try to get Michelle Malkin on air.
[02:33:42.498 --> 02:33:48.424]  Great conservative commentator and has a syndicated column that she writes.
[02:33:48.424 --> 02:33:53.129]  So Twitter's now telling her that she broke Pakistani law and she needs to seek legal counsel.
[02:33:53.129 --> 02:33:55.832]  Huh.
[02:33:55.832 --> 02:33:57.774]  Okay.
[02:33:57.774 --> 02:33:58.275]  Yesterday,
[02:33:59.747 --> 02:34:17.442]  Alex Jones was on the Joe Rogan podcast and one of the, uh, I guess, I guess he's a talking head, commentator, whatever, over at the Young Turks, Hasan Piker, said, Joe Rogan is letting Alex Jones get away with everything right now.
[02:34:17.442 --> 02:34:19.584]  You mean free speech, Hasan?
[02:34:19.584 --> 02:34:21.265]  You mean free speech, Piker?
[02:34:21.265 --> 02:34:25.929]  So yes, that's, I mean, we told you these people hate free speech, now they're just openly admitting it.
[02:34:26.783 --> 02:34:28.803]  I mean, getting away with everything, getting away with what?
[02:34:28.803 --> 02:34:32.504]  Free speech, literally.
[02:34:32.504 --> 02:34:38.266]  Now, jokingly, Piker responded to me and said, yes, I expected a citizen's rest.
[02:34:38.266 --> 02:34:42.927]  And I told him, come on the Alex Jones Show, we'll let you get away with everything, too.
[02:34:42.927 --> 02:34:44.027]  Somehow, I doubt he does.
[02:34:44.027 --> 02:34:46.667]  I was even shocked that he responded to me.
[02:34:46.667 --> 02:34:50.108]  Look, even though we have political differences, I wish we could at least come together.
[02:34:50.108 --> 02:34:50.848]  It's like the same thing.
[02:34:50.848 --> 02:34:54.029]  Like, if we could do political boxing, it would actually be healthy.
[02:34:55.635 --> 02:35:01.997]  It really would, and it'd be massively popular, it'd be massively profitable, but you know who always avoids it?
[02:35:01.997 --> 02:35:03.157]  The left.
[02:35:03.157 --> 02:35:05.858]  Just like they always avoid a debate.
[02:35:05.858 --> 02:35:10.060]  They don't want to be in the same arena as us because they can't beat us.
[02:35:10.060 --> 02:35:14.341]  Now, let's go back out to the phone lines where Josh is calling in from St.
[02:35:14.341 --> 02:35:15.061]  Louis, Missouri.
[02:35:15.061 --> 02:35:17.122]  Go ahead, Josh.
[02:35:17.122 --> 02:35:18.583]  Hey, what's up, Owen?
[02:35:18.583 --> 02:35:20.863]  Just wanted to touch base with you.
[02:35:20.863 --> 02:35:22.544]  We're all proud of you out here in St.
[02:35:22.544 --> 02:35:22.744]  Louis.
[02:35:23.739 --> 02:35:29.000]  And I just wanted to talk to you about the Joe Rogan podcast yesterday.
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:29.880]  Big shout out to St.
[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:30.721]  Louis, my hometown.
[02:35:30.721 --> 02:35:31.101]  Thank you.
[02:35:31.101 --> 02:35:33.101]  Go ahead, Josh.
[02:35:33.101 --> 02:35:44.083]  Yeah, we're going to talk about the Joe Rogan podcast about how, you know, Alex was basically talking about how he thinks the Republicans are the ones that are, you know, fermenting this freedom of speech thing and how they're not doing anything.
[02:35:44.083 --> 02:35:46.424]  And then you're talking to Jacob today, and I was like,
[02:35:46.969 --> 02:35:50.591]  Where is the opposition research on the Republican side?
[02:35:50.591 --> 02:35:53.352]  How does nobody look in the yearbooks for blackface?
[02:35:53.352 --> 02:36:00.836]  How does no one know about this brother with this Muslim congresswoman in Minnesota?
[02:36:00.836 --> 02:36:01.877]  What are they doing?
[02:36:01.877 --> 02:36:04.418]  If any of that came out during the election,
[02:36:05.396 --> 02:36:06.897]  I guarantee you they wouldn't have gotten elected.
[02:36:27.079 --> 02:36:29.640]  There's a couple responses to this.
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:34.261]  One, you ask why doesn't the right or conservatives or Republicans do this?
[02:36:34.261 --> 02:36:38.923]  And the easiest answer I can give you is because our hearts aren't filled with hate.
[02:36:38.923 --> 02:36:49.787]  The reason why the left engages in spending all this time going through the background and tweets and all of this crap and trying to find anything they can drudge up on their opponents is because their heart is filled with hate.
[02:36:50.618 --> 02:36:57.643]  And so when your heart is filled with hate, you're not looking towards finding solutions, you're looking on destroying.
[02:36:57.643 --> 02:37:01.826]  And so in this instance, they just look to destroy their political opponents.
[02:37:01.826 --> 02:37:06.709]  Instead of actually finding solutions to the problems they claim exist, they just seek and destroy.
[02:37:06.709 --> 02:37:08.591]  So that's motivated by hatred that's in their heart.
[02:37:09.557 --> 02:37:24.468]  Now, the second aspect of this is that conservatives, not motivated by hatred, but by information, intelligence, and getting that out to the public, they don't go after people's personal life, they don't go through the dirt and the mud and try to find all this crap.
[02:37:24.468 --> 02:37:24.908]  However...
[02:37:25.789 --> 02:37:29.834]  This is starting to change, Josh, and that's why people like Jacob Wool exist.
[02:37:29.834 --> 02:37:35.200]  That's why people like Ali Alexander exist, and even Mike Cernovich doing a lot of great work.
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:39.566]  And you notice, again, you don't hear much about these people on television news.
[02:37:39.566 --> 02:37:44.512]  Maybe an instance they get a mention, but it's very rare, because it's just not what the right does.
[02:37:45.092 --> 02:37:46.653]  I think it's changing.
[02:37:46.653 --> 02:37:55.820]  I think that we're just beginning to see that tide turning, and it'll be interesting to see what the left does, because they know that they got all the skeletons in their closet.
[02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:57.841]  They know that they're the dirtbags.
[02:37:57.841 --> 02:38:08.588]  That's why they engage in these tactics, to distract from their own nonsense that goes on, their own blackface, their own KKK comments, their own... The wife of Ralph Northam was handing out cotton!
[02:38:09.509 --> 02:38:12.850]  On a field trip to black students the other day, saying, now you know how it feels.
[02:38:12.850 --> 02:38:14.811]  I mean, wow!
[02:38:14.811 --> 02:38:21.813]  So I don't know if that answers your question, Josh, but I do think that trend is going to change.
[02:38:21.813 --> 02:38:25.254]  I sure hope so, because it seems like they're not even trying.
[02:38:25.254 --> 02:38:31.636]  And we're trying to take back our country, and we're trying to vote for people that have the same values as we do.
[02:38:31.636 --> 02:38:37.038]  And then if they're not going to go and try their hardest and look into a yearbook of the guy that they're
[02:38:39.792 --> 02:39:06.973]  That's a very mundane level, because the corruption that we're fighting, you know this, it's been going on for, I mean, quite frankly, centuries, but I mean, in modern history it's been going on for decades, so I mean, we're going up against corrupt courts, we're going up against corrupt FBI, corrupt CIA, corrupt DHS, corrupt politicians, so it takes a while to kind of get the clutter out of the way and be effective.
[02:39:07.987 --> 02:39:14.291]  Yeah, I guess that's what happens when you have eight years of, or probably more than that, twenty years of trash in our government.
[02:39:14.291 --> 02:39:15.171]  Total garbage.
[02:39:15.171 --> 02:39:19.774]  And they have stay-behind networks operating actively right now.
[02:39:19.774 --> 02:39:20.334]  Yep.
[02:39:20.334 --> 02:39:24.257]  It's just like, what's it going to look like after eight years of Trump, you know?
[02:39:24.257 --> 02:39:25.537]  Like, hopefully we get all the trash out.
[02:39:25.537 --> 02:39:26.598]  Well, there you go.
[02:39:26.598 --> 02:39:27.459]  Exactly.
[02:39:27.459 --> 02:39:28.079]  Exactly.
[02:39:28.079 --> 02:39:30.320]  Alright, Josh, thank you so much for the phone call.
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:34.102]  Let's jump out to Brandon in Kentucky.
[02:39:34.102 --> 02:39:34.803]  Go ahead, Brandon.
[02:39:35.854 --> 02:39:37.576]  Hey Owen, how's it going?
[02:39:37.576 --> 02:39:39.257]  Good, thanks for calling.
[02:39:39.257 --> 02:39:45.682]  Hey, uh, real quick, uh, my whole family does, uh, super blue anti-fluoride toothpaste and we all love it.
[02:39:45.682 --> 02:39:50.827]  Um, I'm 43 and I've never been on social media and, uh, I listen to you guys all day long.
[02:39:50.827 --> 02:39:55.190]  And, uh, the reason I called, I heard your comment about, uh, the gun control.
[02:39:55.190 --> 02:40:02.997]  And I think that you're, you're dealing, you're thinking that we're dealing with rational people and we're not dealing with rational people.
[02:40:03.644 --> 02:40:07.667]  I don't feel like we should be giving an inch to the leftists on anything, ever.
[02:40:07.667 --> 02:40:09.789]  Fundamentally I agree with you.
[02:40:09.789 --> 02:40:23.079]  Fundamentally I agree with you, but I have kind of a, it's more of an intellectual thing where I realize that if we go with a hard-line approach like that, it just makes them go even harder to the left.
[02:40:23.079 --> 02:40:29.023]  And so you have to, you have to be at least reasonable in considering a debate on these topics.
[02:40:29.023 --> 02:40:30.404]  That's my opinion.
[02:40:30.404 --> 02:40:31.245]  Harder to the left?
[02:40:32.438 --> 02:40:35.140]  They're going to take our guns.
[02:40:35.140 --> 02:40:37.242]  They're already openly saying they're going to kill babies.
[02:40:37.242 --> 02:40:39.043]  But that's what I'm saying.
[02:40:39.043 --> 02:40:47.691]  But I'm saying if we sit here and we just say, shall not infringe, everybody and anybody can get a gun, then they're going to say, okay, we have to, you know, call for total gun bans.
[02:40:47.691 --> 02:40:51.254]  Well, I don't feel that that's the right way to go about it.
[02:40:51.254 --> 02:40:59.140]  I mean, you have to, I feel like we have to come up with a way, a means to fight these people legitimately.
[02:40:59.140 --> 02:41:01.402]  I mean, militantly without violence.
[02:41:02.694 --> 02:41:04.355]  That's where I'm at.
[02:41:04.355 --> 02:41:06.776]  I mean, what more can they do to us?
[02:41:06.776 --> 02:41:08.857]  Well, here's what we find out.
[02:41:08.857 --> 02:41:11.979]  Do we even really have a vote anymore?
[02:41:11.979 --> 02:41:24.345]  And if we don't, and we learn this, and America learns this, they're going to be clinging to their guns for life.
[02:41:24.345 --> 02:41:25.706]  Wake up.
[02:41:25.706 --> 02:41:26.846]  Wake up.
[02:41:26.846 --> 02:41:29.868]  Get rid of these people that we've got representing us.
[02:41:30.956 --> 02:41:34.457]  Mitch McConnell from my state is asking me to go.
[02:41:34.457 --> 02:41:37.438]  We need real people that are going to look out for us.
[02:41:37.438 --> 02:41:39.519]  And I agree with what you said about Don Jr.
[02:41:39.519 --> 02:41:42.059]  I'll jump off here because I know you've got a lot of callers.
[02:41:42.059 --> 02:41:42.940]  We appreciate you, man.
[02:41:42.940 --> 02:41:44.640]  That's it.
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:46.401]  Yeah, every time I hear Don Jr.
[02:41:46.401 --> 02:41:53.543]  talk, thanks for the call, it feels like he would be the president we wanted Donald Trump to be.
[02:41:53.543 --> 02:41:57.024]  And again, look, Donald Trump, President Trump has done a lot of great things, but
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:02.522]  And maybe it's because he's so inundated and distracted to a certain extent.
[02:42:02.522 --> 02:42:03.983]  He's got all these different things he's working on.
[02:42:03.983 --> 02:42:07.406]  He just isn't moving fast enough on the issues that are biggest to us.
[02:42:07.406 --> 02:42:09.747]  But I just feel like Don Jr.
[02:42:09.747 --> 02:42:10.348]  gets in there.
[02:42:10.348 --> 02:42:12.189]  He's not going to put up with social media censorship.
[02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:15.311]  He's going to stick someone on that immediately.
[02:42:15.311 --> 02:42:16.031]  But I don't know.
[02:42:16.031 --> 02:42:16.932]  Maybe time will tell.
[02:42:16.932 --> 02:42:19.974]  I mean, it would appear that Don Jr.
[02:42:19.974 --> 02:42:21.875]  has presidential aspirations.
[02:42:21.875 --> 02:42:22.856]  But again, only time will tell.
[02:42:23.717 --> 02:42:33.129]  And only time will tell if eight years of Trump will have the same effect on this country as far as, uh, just any effect as Obama's eight years did.
[02:42:33.129 --> 02:42:35.612]  Obviously it'd be pro-America unlike Obama anti-America.
[02:42:35.612 --> 02:42:37.435]  Alright folks, we got a break coming up.
[02:42:37.435 --> 02:42:38.316]  More calls on their side.

[02:44:34.065 --> 02:44:38.027]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:44:38.027 --> 02:44:39.848]  I've got two in my home.

[02:44:45.951 --> 02:44:46.792]  Don't live

[02:45:59.506 --> 02:46:02.428]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.

[02:46:58.777 --> 02:47:03.481]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:03.481 --> 02:47:16.170]  Dark side of the moon.
[02:47:39.051 --> 02:47:43.353]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:43.353 --> 02:47:47.535]  No, you're not in the wonderful world of Oz.
[02:47:47.535 --> 02:47:48.396]  But you might as well be.
[02:47:48.396 --> 02:47:51.417]  Because it's pretty trippy around here.
[02:47:51.417 --> 02:47:57.620]  Alright, we're taking your phone calls here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:57.620 --> 02:47:59.421]  I will be sticking around for the fourth hour.
[02:47:59.421 --> 02:48:03.483]  I'm going to be covering the Jacob Wool Press Conference.
[02:48:03.483 --> 02:48:07.225]  Airing some epic clips from Alex Jones on Joe Rogan yesterday.
[02:48:08.570 --> 02:48:12.471]  And maybe taking some more of your calls, but let's go back out to the phone lines now.
[02:48:12.471 --> 02:48:14.992]  Victor from California has called in.
[02:48:14.992 --> 02:48:17.172]  Go ahead, Victor.
[02:48:17.172 --> 02:48:20.013]  Hello, and thank you for taking my call.
[02:48:20.013 --> 02:48:20.953]  I'm a new listener.
[02:48:20.953 --> 02:48:24.994]  I just found out about InfoWars about a month ago.
[02:48:24.994 --> 02:48:30.296]  You called into the war room a couple of weeks ago, right?
[02:48:30.296 --> 02:48:30.796]  Yeah, I did.
[02:48:30.796 --> 02:48:34.257]  Yeah, I was talking about Savannah and what a great job she did on your show.
[02:48:35.285 --> 02:48:35.865]  If you remember.
[02:48:35.865 --> 02:48:37.906]  Yeah, I remember talking to you.
[02:48:37.906 --> 02:48:39.747]  I remember you telling me how you discovered us and everything.
[02:48:39.747 --> 02:48:40.868]  Yeah, go ahead, Victor.
[02:48:40.868 --> 02:48:41.828]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:48:41.828 --> 02:48:48.751]  So I was watching you guys yesterday and then I saw you showing the clips from the Joe Rogan show.
[02:48:48.751 --> 02:48:51.893]  So I watched the entire thing, entire four and a half hours.
[02:48:51.893 --> 02:48:53.393]  I got to tell you, man, it was great.
[02:48:53.393 --> 02:48:56.535]  It was informative, entertaining and funny.
[02:48:57.208 --> 02:49:00.030]  I didn't realize how funny Alex is.
[02:49:00.030 --> 02:49:04.013]  It was one of the best shows I've ever seen in my life.
[02:49:14.102 --> 02:49:24.252]  It's just three alpha males not censoring their free speech, opening up their mind, opening up their intellect, and then just letting go.
[02:49:24.252 --> 02:49:26.574]  And you don't get that enough in media anymore.
[02:49:26.574 --> 02:49:32.780]  And that's why it was so refreshing, because it's just three men who are friends, alpha males, who are just like,
[02:49:33.766 --> 02:49:34.487]  We're just talking.
[02:49:34.487 --> 02:49:37.349]  We're just having a conversation like we were sitting at the bar.
[02:49:37.349 --> 02:49:40.191]  That's what talk radio used to be.
[02:49:40.191 --> 02:49:46.997]  But now with political correctness and all the other garbage and people afraid of being censored, you rarely get this anymore.
[02:49:46.997 --> 02:49:57.166]  So that's why I think it was so refreshing in this age of censorship and in this age of attacking masculinity to just have three alpha males sitting around, chumming it up, talking about real stuff.
[02:49:59.841 --> 02:50:00.441]  I agree.
[02:50:00.441 --> 02:50:01.702]  It was amazing.
[02:50:01.702 --> 02:50:08.186]  And they discussed so many topics, so much new information that I didn't know about before.
[02:50:08.186 --> 02:50:09.607]  It's hard to describe it.
[02:50:09.607 --> 02:50:14.891]  So that's why I want everybody who didn't see it to go back and watch the entire thing.
[02:50:14.891 --> 02:50:22.215]  One thing I was going to mention, Alex talked about his health and the stress he's under and how he stopped working out.
[02:50:22.215 --> 02:50:26.438]  His diet is not as good as it used to be just because of all the stress that he's under.
[02:50:26.438 --> 02:50:29.280]  And I just wanted to encourage you, if you talk to Alex,
[02:50:29.929 --> 02:50:35.613]  Please let him know that I support him as a new listener, and he really needs to take care of himself, man.
[02:50:35.613 --> 02:50:38.115]  He needs to start working out, watch his diet.
[02:50:38.115 --> 02:50:42.498]  Maybe he can go work out with you.
[02:50:42.498 --> 02:50:44.000]  I'm really concerned about his health.
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.222]  I just want him to be as healthy as possible.
[02:50:47.222 --> 02:50:53.747]  Well, thank you, and I know that a lot of people pray for Alex and, you know, do worry about his health.
[02:50:53.747 --> 02:50:57.530]  But, you know, as far as that's concerned, here's my thing.
[02:50:58.874 --> 02:51:08.103]  I mean, I endure some stress, obviously, and whatever, but I don't have a family and I don't run this company that has 100 employees.
[02:51:08.103 --> 02:51:16.531]  So I can't even imagine the levels of stress that Alex gets just from those other, you know, things in his life that I can't even imagine.
[02:51:16.531 --> 02:51:21.315]  So I'm not going to sit here and be like, hey, Alex, you know, come work out with me two hours a night.
[02:51:21.315 --> 02:51:23.637]  He's got kids and a wife to think about at home.
[02:51:26.272 --> 02:51:27.832]  I think that there's a certain level.
[02:51:27.832 --> 02:51:41.636]  I think that the stress that Alex gets, though, more than anything, if I could impart anything to Alex, it's just that, you know, don't put so much pressure on yourself.
[02:51:41.636 --> 02:51:51.918]  And I think that that is what drives Alex's stress more than anything, is that he puts so much pressure on himself, knowing the role he's in,
[02:51:53.646 --> 02:51:57.251]  To just be totally efficient and effective, which is impossible to be all the time.
[02:51:57.251 --> 02:52:00.295]  I mean, nobody bats a thousand in Major League Baseball.
[02:52:00.295 --> 02:52:07.885]  The best baseball players in the history of the world failed, you know, 70% of the time they bat it.
[02:52:07.885 --> 02:52:09.306]  So, I mean, I think that that's...
[02:52:09.887 --> 02:52:21.431]  What adds to Alex's stress more than anything, other than the fact he's got all these things on his shoulder, is that he really does apply the pressure to himself to be as effective as possible.
[02:52:21.431 --> 02:52:27.454]  And when you try to do that, I mean, it's like, I can't even get all the information I want here in four hours of an Alex Jones Show.
[02:52:27.454 --> 02:52:31.535]  I can't imagine trying to accomplish everything that Alex wants to accomplish in 24 hours.
[02:52:31.535 --> 02:52:32.716]  I can barely do it half the time.
[02:52:33.476 --> 02:52:34.377]  Thank you, Owen.
[02:52:34.377 --> 02:52:35.697]  One more thing I was going to mention.
[02:52:57.162 --> 02:52:58.704]  Thinking about buying some products.
[02:52:58.704 --> 02:53:02.687]  You know, I haven't bought anything from you guys yet, but I wanted to get some books.
[02:53:02.687 --> 02:53:07.792]  I wanted to get Roger Stone's book, something else, but then I heard all these reports about Chase Bank.
[02:53:08.832 --> 02:53:13.897]  Uh, closing people's bank accounts just because they're conservative, like Martina Mercota, for example.
[02:53:13.897 --> 02:53:22.265]  I have a Chase credit card, so now I'm afraid to use the Chase credit card on your website because I'm afraid they may cancel my credit or close my account.
[02:53:22.265 --> 02:53:24.927]  Well, I would say in the near future... Something has to be done about this.
[02:53:24.927 --> 02:53:33.215]  Yes, I would say in the near future you're probably fine, but you're thinking forward in, like, I mean, who knows where the country goes, but maybe in a year, two years, four years, five years...
[02:53:34.216 --> 02:53:37.017]  They might look at you and say, wow, this person shopped at Infowars store.
[02:53:37.017 --> 02:53:38.517]  Let's cancel his account.
[02:53:38.517 --> 02:53:40.757]  That's what's coming next.
[02:53:40.757 --> 02:53:42.138]  There's probably workarounds to that.
[02:53:42.138 --> 02:53:46.178]  I mean, you could get like a prepaid card or, you know, I don't know.
[02:53:46.178 --> 02:53:50.479]  I'm not going to suggest you start another bank account or whatever, but maybe that's what you have to do.
[02:53:50.479 --> 02:54:02.682]  Just ditch Chase and tell him why, you know, be like, hi, I have to end my line of credit with you because of, you know, what I'm seeing you guys doing as far as political, you know, motivated
[02:54:03.553 --> 02:54:07.094]  Which really, I guess it's like financial censorship, kind of.
[02:54:07.094 --> 02:54:08.914]  But I don't know, Victor.
[02:54:08.914 --> 02:54:10.995]  That's a tough decision.
[02:54:10.995 --> 02:54:13.215]  That's one obviously you're thinking about, Victor.
[02:54:13.215 --> 02:54:17.756]  Thank you so much for calling and for considering going to InfoWare Store for the first time.
[02:54:17.756 --> 02:54:21.657]  Let's go to Uncle Sam now in Louisiana.
[02:54:21.657 --> 02:54:22.777]  Uncle Sam, go ahead.
[02:54:22.777 --> 02:54:24.598]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:24.598 --> 02:54:27.218]  Hey, God bless you there.
[02:54:27.218 --> 02:54:29.379]  Owen, good to talk to you, always.
[02:54:29.379 --> 02:54:30.019]  Good to talk to you.
[02:54:30.968 --> 02:54:34.191]  I got some great news for you, good news for you anyway.
[02:54:34.191 --> 02:54:41.316]  I was wearing my mega hat at the Uptown Whole Foods stores the other day and two people came up and said, like your hat.
[02:54:42.139 --> 02:54:46.782]  And that's probably one of the most liberal areas of the city, so I thought it was pretty cool.
[02:54:46.782 --> 02:54:53.066]  Now you're in New Orleans, just so people know, in case they don't know who the caller is, Uncle Sam does videos on his YouTube channel.
[02:54:53.066 --> 02:54:59.990]  He goes out in New Orleans and dresses like Uncle Sam and just does street conversations slash interviews.
[02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:06.334]  He's actually won an Infowars competition before, and he gets some powerful footage on there too.
[02:55:08.001 --> 02:55:20.449]  Yeah, yeah, but it's, oh well, it's New Orleans, it's the streets, and like you brought it up, if you're going to go out there and fight this war, the front lines are the streets, and that's where I've been for the past six years doing this.
[02:55:20.449 --> 02:55:27.633]  And for the censorship, they've been just knocking off subscribers off my site like crazy this week.
[02:55:27.633 --> 02:55:28.454]  It's insane.
[02:55:28.454 --> 02:55:36.239]  I won't post a video for four or five days and my subscriptions go up, I start posting videos, and all of a sudden I lose them.
[02:55:36.239 --> 02:55:36.819]  It's weird.
[02:55:37.578 --> 02:55:48.721]  And if anybody wants to go to it, it's Michael DeBarry, D-I capital B-A-R-I on YouTube there, and hit that subscribe button.
[02:55:48.721 --> 02:55:56.663]  But that's one of the things I'm really kind of, like you've been talking about, of course, I can't wait till about three o'clock to get to see what that Omar
[02:56:00.402 --> 02:56:02.664]  Well, a press conference is going to say that's going to be.
[02:56:02.664 --> 02:56:04.246]  I'd love to see her go down.
[02:56:04.246 --> 02:56:07.249]  Yeah, that'll actually be beginning here in about 10 minutes.
[02:56:07.249 --> 02:56:12.454]  It's actually 3 o'clock Eastern, to clarify, so 2 o'clock Central here.
[02:56:12.454 --> 02:56:13.955]  So yeah, I just want to clarify that.
[02:56:13.955 --> 02:56:16.278]  That'll be coming up here in 10 minutes.
[02:56:16.278 --> 02:56:19.881]  And you mentioned the social media networks you guys have.
[02:56:19.881 --> 02:56:22.384]  Is there a place on your site to hit on them?
[02:56:24.810 --> 02:56:29.653]  You know, to contact or to get on them because I can't find where they are.
[02:56:29.653 --> 02:56:31.854]  Are you talking about Infocomms?
[02:56:31.854 --> 02:56:32.935]  Yeah, Infocomms.
[02:56:32.935 --> 02:56:36.517]  Yeah, you can just go to Infocomms.org.
[02:56:36.517 --> 02:56:40.519]  Infocomms.org is the website.
[02:56:40.519 --> 02:56:46.202]  That's terrific, yeah, because I figure that's a great place to make some contacts on that one, too.
[02:56:46.202 --> 02:56:52.886]  One other thing, and you mentioned it briefly, you brought it up in the past week and it kind of stuck my craw.
[02:56:53.830 --> 02:57:06.237]  Of course, Trump's doing a lot of good, positive things, but the one thing that just really slammed me into a wall is when he came out and started promoting that 5G.
[02:57:06.237 --> 02:57:07.018]  Yeah, pushing for 6G, even.
[02:57:12.901 --> 02:57:15.002]  Just to try to understand where Trump is coming from.
[02:57:15.002 --> 02:57:17.924]  I think Trump sees this as a technology breakthrough.
[02:57:17.924 --> 02:57:21.386]  And to him, that's economic, a positive thing.
[02:57:21.386 --> 02:57:24.288]  It creates jobs.
[02:57:24.288 --> 02:57:25.428]  It creates new technology.
[02:57:25.428 --> 02:57:29.731]  So that's something that Trump, I feel like, is just built into his principles.
[02:57:29.731 --> 02:57:30.751]  It's just yes, jobs.
[02:57:30.751 --> 02:57:31.572]  Yes, creation.
[02:57:31.572 --> 02:57:32.412]  Yes, innovation.
[02:57:32.412 --> 02:57:33.313]  Yes, technology.
[02:57:34.193 --> 02:57:39.302]  And my guess is there's just nobody in his ear saying, hey president, look at the studies on 5G.
[02:57:39.302 --> 02:57:42.908]  Hey president, look at the studies of wireless radio waves.
[02:57:42.908 --> 02:57:44.751]  So I don't know if the president even knows what he's promoting.
[02:57:54.557 --> 02:58:03.519]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:58:03.519 --> 02:58:13.642]  But they are riddled with guys and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:58:13.642 --> 02:58:22.164]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:58:23.004 --> 02:58:24.345]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:58:24.345 --> 02:58:25.506]  You must experience it.
[02:58:25.506 --> 02:58:27.468]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:58:27.468 --> 02:58:32.512]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:58:32.512 --> 02:58:34.033]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:58:34.033 --> 02:58:35.514]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:58:35.514 --> 02:58:42.199]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[02:59:49.668 --> 02:59:55.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.369 --> 03:00:06.272]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:00:06.272 --> 03:00:09.252]  We were worried we may not be able to connect with Matt Bracken today.
[03:00:09.252 --> 03:00:15.033]  He had a tech issue at his house, but he is connected and he will now be hosting the fourth hour.
[03:00:15.033 --> 03:00:17.354]  So we're looking forward to having him take over.
[03:00:18.607 --> 03:00:29.816]  And we will be airing the Jacob Wohl press conference whenever that goes live and they make their conclusive statements upon the findings of their investigation into Ilhan Omar.
[03:00:29.816 --> 03:00:39.525]  Real quick, for a news blitz here, lawmakers demand answers on surprise microphones inside the Google Nest.
[03:00:39.525 --> 03:00:44.389]  Oh, okay, so what, you're going to put Sundar Pichai back on the stand under oath so we can get away with perjury?
[03:00:45.584 --> 03:00:48.565]  FTC's new task force could be trouble for Big Tech today.
[03:00:48.565 --> 03:00:50.965]  This one is out of the Wall Street Journal.
[03:00:50.965 --> 03:00:58.627]  Again, the FTC has launched a new task force to look at monopolistic practices of Big Tech.
[03:00:58.627 --> 03:01:01.808]  We'll see if that rubber ever meets the road.
[03:01:01.808 --> 03:01:04.489]  Actress Jennifer Lawrence lays out a plan to save America.
[03:01:04.489 --> 03:01:06.729]  So Jennifer Lawrence has it all figured out, folks.
[03:01:06.729 --> 03:01:08.830]  She's going to take care of everything.
[03:01:08.830 --> 03:01:09.930]  No, the irony here is that
[03:01:12.068 --> 03:01:17.472]  Hollywood telling us how to run our lives is the most ridiculous thing ever.
[03:01:17.472 --> 03:01:21.395]  And it's the arrogance of these people that they think we care.
[03:01:21.395 --> 03:01:22.035]  We don't.
[03:01:22.035 --> 03:01:24.077]  We're not even going to see your movies anymore.
[03:01:25.256 --> 03:01:36.366]  And then this story made me realize the truth about Bill Maher's statements the other day when he said that, you know, flyover country is jealous of the coasts.
[03:01:36.366 --> 03:01:36.746]  Oh really?
[03:01:36.746 --> 03:01:39.548]  We're jealous of feces and needles on the streets of San Francisco?
[03:01:39.548 --> 03:01:39.788]  Really?
[03:01:39.788 --> 03:01:44.392]  We're jealous of taxes in New York that are so high people are leaving in droves?
[03:01:44.392 --> 03:01:45.894]  No, the truth is that Bill Maher
[03:01:46.394 --> 03:01:49.297]  And Jennifer Lawrence are jealous of flyover country.
[03:01:49.297 --> 03:01:55.963]  That we actually live simple lives, happy lives, and we don't need all the glitz and the glamour to make us happy.
[03:01:55.963 --> 03:01:58.625]  That's their misery projected onto us.
[03:01:59.875 --> 03:02:02.536]  They're the ones that wish they live in flyover country.
[03:02:02.536 --> 03:02:10.019]  They're the ones that can't stand the fact they live in these overcrowded, literal hellholes covered in human feces.
[03:02:10.019 --> 03:02:14.840]  But then they try to deny it and project it onto us like, oh, they're so jealous of us.
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:17.241]  No, we're not.
[03:02:17.241 --> 03:02:19.002]  We can't stand you anymore.
[03:02:20.168 --> 03:02:21.889]  This is from the Hollywood Reporter.
[03:02:21.889 --> 03:02:22.829]  Look at this.
[03:02:22.829 --> 03:02:24.010]  Inexplicable?
[03:02:35.202 --> 03:02:38.464]  The guy hated Trump and he hated white people.
[03:02:38.464 --> 03:02:40.886]  There's his behavior explained.
[03:02:40.886 --> 03:02:41.927]  But can you believe?
[03:02:41.927 --> 03:02:46.370]  Again, I'm about to break Jesse Smollett and the pressure of Hollywood fame.
[03:02:46.370 --> 03:02:48.652]  Oh my gosh, it's so hard.
[03:02:48.652 --> 03:02:53.855]  I'm a pampered actor that gets anything and everything I want and millions of dollars.
[03:02:53.855 --> 03:02:55.616]  It's so hard on me.
[03:02:55.616 --> 03:02:57.398]  Oh, feel bad for me, America.
[03:02:57.398 --> 03:03:02.421]  I just staged a hate crime, a total hoax to try to start a race war in this country.
[03:03:02.421 --> 03:03:03.662]  Please feel bad for me.
[03:03:05.103 --> 03:03:07.866]  And the liberal press goes along with it.
[03:03:07.866 --> 03:03:11.049]  London blood-soaked after five stabbings in 24 hours.
[03:03:11.049 --> 03:03:12.690]  Well, you know who did that.
[03:03:12.690 --> 03:03:16.514]  Netanyahu to be charged with bribery, pending hearing.
[03:03:16.514 --> 03:03:18.836]  That story's been floating for two years.
[03:03:18.836 --> 03:03:24.661]  Immigrants suspected of five rapes in Swedish ski village.
[03:03:24.661 --> 03:03:26.663]  Okay, let's get a quick call in here.
[03:03:26.663 --> 03:03:28.585]  Let's go to Dee in New York.
[03:03:28.585 --> 03:03:30.667]  Dee, I'm sorry, you got 60 seconds, but go ahead.
[03:03:31.775 --> 03:03:33.436]  Hi Owen, that's all right.
[03:03:33.436 --> 03:03:41.963]  I just wanted to make a comment about that to leave woman from yesterday during the Cohen hearing when she called Mark Meadows a racist.
[03:03:41.963 --> 03:03:51.370]  And Elijah Cummings, you know, like grain-standard about how what great friends they are and yet you're the chairman of the committee and you allowed her to get away with it.
[03:03:51.370 --> 03:03:52.791]  And you allowed that pathetic
[03:03:53.627 --> 03:03:56.130]  Wannabe apology that she lobbed out.
[03:03:56.130 --> 03:03:58.772]  Someone, we know exactly who you meant, honey.
[03:03:58.772 --> 03:04:00.534]  We know you were talking to Mark Meadows.
[03:04:00.534 --> 03:04:02.817]  I just wanted to get your opinion on what you thought.
[03:04:03.288 --> 03:04:16.131]  You know, Elijah Cummings is a really interesting case, because he has radical leftist instincts, but on a certain level, he does play things down the middle.
[03:04:16.131 --> 03:04:23.712]  I mean, if you go back and listen to the Daryl Issa hearings with Elijah Cummings, he was all pissed off that Congress was trying to hide the truth about that.
[03:04:23.712 --> 03:04:30.134]  And like you said, despite him and Jim Jordan bashing heads politically, they are good friends.
[03:04:30.854 --> 03:04:33.035]  Uh, so it's this weird- same thing with Van Jones.
[03:04:33.035 --> 03:04:37.939]  Van Jones was at CPAC, and he did an interview with some guys that were wearing Trump hats.
[03:04:37.939 --> 03:04:39.760]  Totally cool inter- exchange!
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:42.722]  But when he goes on CNN, it's like a totally different thing.
[03:04:42.722 --> 03:04:51.367]  So, so I don't really know if I can fully explain that, but as far as this radical leftist claiming that Mark Meadows is racist, she's probably a racist, and so that's why she's projecting.
[03:04:54.113 --> 03:04:58.055]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:58.055 --> 03:05:01.336]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:05:01.336 --> 03:05:07.619]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:07.619 --> 03:05:10.381]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:05:11.121 --> 03:05:14.943]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:14.943 --> 03:05:21.406]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.406 --> 03:05:26.369]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.116 --> 03:05:31.058]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:05:31.058 --> 03:05:38.261]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.261 --> 03:05:42.943]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:05:42.943 --> 03:05:49.165]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.165 --> 03:05:53.127]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:06:07.804 --> 03:06:12.768]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, we've got two things coming up.
[03:06:12.768 --> 03:06:20.054]  The press conference where the findings in the investigation into Ilhan Omar, that is going to be coming up shortly.
[03:06:20.054 --> 03:06:22.777]  And Matt Bracken takes over the fourth hour.
[03:06:22.777 --> 03:06:24.819]  Now I'm about to hand the baton over to Matt.
[03:06:25.646 --> 03:06:27.288]  And I want to hand it over in this fashion.
[03:06:27.288 --> 03:06:31.794]  A lot of what you have predicted on the Alex Jones Show has come to fruition.
[03:06:31.794 --> 03:06:32.855]  We're not celebrating this.
[03:06:32.855 --> 03:06:34.197]  It's just the truth.
[03:06:34.197 --> 03:06:40.264]  And now, seemingly every day, there's a new attack on a Trump supporter by a radical leftist.
[03:06:41.946 --> 03:06:48.533]  As we predicted here, yourself included, the left is now staging crimes to blame Trump supporters.
[03:06:48.533 --> 03:06:51.316]  Matt Bracken, you predicted all this.
[03:06:51.316 --> 03:06:54.520]  You wrote about it on your website, enemiesforeignanddomestic.com.
[03:06:54.520 --> 03:06:56.342]  You wrote about it in your books.
[03:06:56.342 --> 03:07:01.648]  So I just want to hand the baton off to you and get you off racing to just comment
[03:07:02.288 --> 03:07:13.156]  On the fact that the left is becoming more unhinged, trying to start a race war in this country, and trying to frame crimes, and it's probably just going to get worse, on conservatives.
[03:07:13.156 --> 03:07:16.779]  So Matt Bracken, EnemiesForeignAndDomestic.com, he takes over.
[03:07:16.779 --> 03:07:18.320]  He's got his exclusive intel.
[03:07:18.320 --> 03:07:20.302]  Matt Bracken.
[03:07:20.302 --> 03:07:21.223]  Thanks, Owen.
[03:07:21.223 --> 03:07:29.569]  Yeah, this is something that resonated with me yesterday when I saw the Joe Rogan interview with Alex.
[03:07:31.437 --> 03:07:35.281]  You know, Joe said a lot of the stuff you've been predicting has turned out to be true, too.
[03:07:35.281 --> 03:07:38.665]  And my response is the same as Alex's.
[03:07:38.665 --> 03:07:40.286]  I don't want to be right about this stuff.
[03:07:40.286 --> 03:07:41.848]  I'd rather be wrong.
[03:07:41.848 --> 03:07:49.155]  You know, who wants this potential civil war, race war that we're lurching into?
[03:07:49.155 --> 03:07:50.537]  Nobody sane would want it.
[03:07:52.193 --> 03:07:59.875]  It's more in the manner of trying to warn people that are wondering, can this really be happening?
[03:07:59.875 --> 03:08:01.455]  And what should I do to prepare?
[03:08:01.455 --> 03:08:05.176]  I don't like being a Cassandra.
[03:08:05.176 --> 03:08:08.476]  I don't like being a preacher of doom and gloom.
[03:08:08.476 --> 03:08:15.177]  I wish that I could just write genre detective fiction during the good old days, you know, the 60s, 70s, 80s.
[03:08:15.177 --> 03:08:17.638]  I mean, paradoxically,
[03:08:18.317 --> 03:08:23.879]  We had the looming threat of a global nuclear holocaust over the top of our heads.
[03:08:23.879 --> 03:08:25.519]  But it never happened.
[03:08:25.519 --> 03:08:28.680]  And the times were basically pretty good.
[03:08:28.680 --> 03:08:30.521]  Maybe the technology wasn't as cool.
[03:08:30.521 --> 03:08:32.341]  We didn't have smartphones.
[03:08:32.341 --> 03:08:36.422]  You know, you had pay phones that you had to find and put coins in.
[03:08:36.422 --> 03:08:38.423]  Youngsters can even imagine.
[03:08:38.423 --> 03:08:42.724]  But now, look at the societal collapse around our heads.
[03:08:42.724 --> 03:08:46.185]  When you see one of the two major parties
[03:08:48.576 --> 03:08:52.499]  Defending infanticide, there's no other way to put it.
[03:08:52.499 --> 03:09:10.392]  This harkens back to ancient civilizations that went off the rails in such spectacular fashion that they're remembered down through the millennia, like Sodom and Gomorrah.
[03:09:10.392 --> 03:09:14.676]  They become such a spectacular fail that it's
[03:09:16.161 --> 03:09:28.808]  Preached in oral and then written tradition, generation after generation, these are societies that are just blaring out to the world that they're about to collapse.
[03:09:28.808 --> 03:09:45.778]  When you have the sexualizing of children, you know, when you have little boys in gay strip clubs doing the bump and grind in g-strings, you know, like 10-11 year old boys, trans boys, this is not a healthy society, folks.
[03:09:46.522 --> 03:09:53.335]  And you can say what you want about the Chinese and the Russians, maybe even to some extent the Iranians.
[03:09:54.429 --> 03:10:09.444]  You can say what you want about their cultures and societies, even their religions, but when they look at us, they have to be shaking their heads and saying, this is a society that is stumbling towards a collapse.
[03:10:09.444 --> 03:10:18.733]  There's no coincidence that two of our most high-tech destroyers, Burke-class destroyers, were hit by tankers.
[03:10:19.508 --> 03:10:26.298]  This is a warning that our military, even our military, has lost its way.
[03:10:26.298 --> 03:10:32.348]  Political correctness in the United States has become the most important value.
[03:10:33.055 --> 03:10:42.298]  There are naval captains and admirals who are basically pretending that the naked emperor is wearing beautiful clothes.
[03:10:42.298 --> 03:10:47.380]  They get up every day and they say, political correctness is where it's at.
[03:10:47.380 --> 03:10:48.941]  Diversity is our strength.
[03:10:48.941 --> 03:10:50.901]  They know it's a lie.
[03:10:50.901 --> 03:10:57.644]  They know that our best military units have become political correct clown shows.
[03:10:58.510 --> 03:11:04.754]  This is, this is not a way to run a military that's going to win any kind of a serious major war.
[03:11:04.754 --> 03:11:12.818]  I'm not talking about drone wars where, you know, you can throw a couple elite troops on the ground and have predators circling, you know, to drop hellfires.
[03:11:12.818 --> 03:11:24.384]  I'm talking about a grind it out on the ground, like Korean War II, or a war in Europe, or a war in Southeast Asia, a serious real war.
[03:11:24.384 --> 03:11:25.585]  Our present
[03:11:26.598 --> 03:11:33.104]  Our present civilization, our society, would not support, could not support a World War II today.
[03:11:33.104 --> 03:11:35.486]  We would fold up like a cheap suit.
[03:11:35.486 --> 03:11:45.814]  Nobody would want to, you know, to join the military by the tens of thousands and go to fight at Iwo Jima and Okinawa, a Normandy landing.
[03:11:45.814 --> 03:11:47.215]  We just couldn't do it.
[03:11:47.215 --> 03:11:49.117]  And our enemies know it.
[03:11:49.117 --> 03:11:53.660]  Our country's becoming a very dangerous clown show.
[03:11:53.660 --> 03:11:55.502]  And now the latest thing is,
[03:11:56.718 --> 03:12:01.863]  Social media just absolutely putting the screws on with censorship.
[03:12:01.863 --> 03:12:05.205]  This is because the left can't win an argument.
[03:12:05.205 --> 03:12:12.291]  What they have to do is put the mute button on all other arguments other than the left.
[03:12:12.291 --> 03:12:20.397]  This is why we've seen, you know, Tommy Robinson's unbelievable, terrific video on the Panorama BBC expose.
[03:12:22.953 --> 03:12:27.215]  Anybody who hasn't seen this, really, take an hour and watch this.
[03:12:27.215 --> 03:12:47.885]  If you can imagine the British version of 60 Minutes having the tables turned on them by a reverse sting, so the conservative who's being set up as the patsy in the documentary turns the tables and actually does an expose on 60 Minutes or BBC Panorama.
[03:12:47.885 --> 03:12:52.067]  Well, within less than one day of this video being out,
[03:12:52.754 --> 03:13:01.807]  Tommy Robinson was completely banned from Facebook and Instagram where he had, you know, unbelievable numbers of followers.
[03:13:01.807 --> 03:13:06.313]  Now he's down to YouTube and he expects to disappear from YouTube at any minute.
[03:13:06.313 --> 03:13:08.576]  So this is what's happening and leading into 2020.
[03:13:09.938 --> 03:13:14.141]  We're going to see this ramp up.
[03:13:14.141 --> 03:13:18.584]  I posted about the Tommy Robinson video with a link to the YouTube video.
[03:13:18.584 --> 03:13:20.705]  Now, it's legit on YouTube, right?
[03:13:20.705 --> 03:13:22.746]  It's still legit, not banned on YouTube.
[03:13:22.746 --> 03:13:29.831]  The Tommy Robinson panorama video, I posted a link to it and I got another 30-day ban.
[03:13:31.051 --> 03:13:37.113]  Within hours, I was given my 8th 30-day ban in the last 18 months.
[03:13:37.113 --> 03:13:41.775]  So basically, they give me a few weeks, then they kick me off for another month.
[03:13:41.775 --> 03:13:43.756]  Well, this is what they're doing across the board.
[03:13:44.548 --> 03:13:59.017]  So not only is Tommy Robinson banned from Facebook, now Facebook has increased the censorship to where they don't permit you to post about banned people in a positive way.
[03:13:59.017 --> 03:14:05.981]  So posting, I think that Tommy Robinson got screwed over by Facebook, gets you banned from Facebook.
[03:14:06.673 --> 03:14:09.274]  I mean, this is sounding like the Soviet Union.
[03:14:09.274 --> 03:14:18.256]  And just imagine what's going to happen leading into 2020 with all of the, you know, you know that the Democrats are going to be doing the vote harvesting.
[03:14:18.256 --> 03:14:20.417]  They're going to be harvesting out of the graveyards.
[03:14:20.417 --> 03:14:30.460]  They're going to be, you know, stashing boxes of extra ballots to push over the close races like in Orange County or almost in Broward County.
[03:14:30.460 --> 03:14:33.401]  And the social media is not going to let us talk about it.
[03:14:33.965 --> 03:14:38.388]  They're going to throttle, or what do they call it?
[03:14:38.388 --> 03:14:41.050]  Now it's called de-boosting.
[03:14:41.050 --> 03:14:44.493]  So they use algorithms to essentially turn our volume down.
[03:14:44.493 --> 03:14:54.520]  We have the illusion of free speech, but it's not really free speech if your volume is turned down and the left's volume is turned up.
[03:14:54.520 --> 03:15:00.625]  I mean, we're really getting into a time where we need to start thinking about alternative social media,
[03:15:01.420 --> 03:15:22.977]  Anywhere that we can find it because you know, I only stay on Facebook sort of to test their censorship and Obviously, you know as a guinea pig, it's pretty illustrative, you know eight months out of the last like 16 or 17 months I've been banned, you know for for nothing just for being a conservative basically not going along with the program All right
[03:15:23.863 --> 03:15:28.327]  When we come back from the break, I'm going to kick it to the phone calls.
[03:15:28.327 --> 03:15:38.116]  So the call-in number, you should all know by now, 877-789-2539, 789-ALEX.
[03:15:38.116 --> 03:15:44.302]  And we'll be going to the phones when we come back from the break and have some other surprises today.
[03:15:44.302 --> 03:15:45.343]  And we'll see you in a couple.
[03:15:53.058 --> 03:15:55.680]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[03:15:55.680 --> 03:15:56.781]  Get back to nature.

[03:16:52.962 --> 03:16:54.202]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.202 --> 03:16:58.103]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.103 --> 03:16:59.644]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:59.644 --> 03:17:02.604]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.604 --> 03:17:08.166]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:08.166 --> 03:17:09.366]  I can help you, too.

[03:19:57.120 --> 03:20:00.203]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:00.203 --> 03:20:09.450]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:20:09.450 --> 03:20:12.412]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:20:12.412 --> 03:20:15.634]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:28.962 --> 03:20:30.503]  Okay, we're back.
[03:20:30.503 --> 03:20:34.165]  And as I promised, we're going to go to the phones.
[03:20:34.165 --> 03:20:39.108]  Not surprisingly, what do you think people would like to talk about?
[03:20:39.108 --> 03:20:42.550]  A few people want to talk about Alex's appearance on Joe Rogan.
[03:20:42.550 --> 03:20:50.635]  I just checked something like 3,100,000 views in under a day.
[03:20:50.635 --> 03:20:54.638]  I mean, that's some numbers right there.
[03:20:54.638 --> 03:20:56.239]  That's some massive interest.
[03:20:57.017 --> 03:21:05.464]  And up on the phones, I see Jeff in Canada has been holding on for an hour and a half to talk about Joe Rogan.
[03:21:05.464 --> 03:21:08.466]  So Jeff, you deserve the prize for patience.
[03:21:08.466 --> 03:21:08.946]  Go ahead.
[03:21:08.946 --> 03:21:11.248]  Hey, Matt.
[03:21:11.248 --> 03:21:12.329]  Great show today.
[03:21:12.329 --> 03:21:16.572]  Just really, really enjoy all that InfoWars does.
[03:21:16.572 --> 03:21:17.773]  Want to give a shout out to the crew.
[03:21:17.773 --> 03:21:20.035]  I know there's like a busy kitchen back there.
[03:21:20.035 --> 03:21:21.236]  They do a fantastic job.
[03:21:21.236 --> 03:21:23.037]  A couple of quick points.
[03:21:23.037 --> 03:21:26.640]  You know, Alex going on Joe's podcast,
[03:21:27.344 --> 03:21:34.726]  I mean, I just kudos for him for reaching out to a friend and trying to bridge, you know, a breach in the relationship.
[03:21:34.726 --> 03:21:48.990]  But I think the powerful moment for me out of that whole thing was the red pilling of Joe in regards to post-birth infancy and how, you know, it's a shocking thing.
[03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:54.331]  And I think, you know, I think Joe is going to have an awakening when he starts seeing the extreme uncensored
[03:21:55.172 --> 03:22:01.657]  Yeah, and I think the right thing to do there, which they did, was display the First Amendment
[03:22:25.153 --> 03:22:37.243]  For a period of time where all of a sudden things get breached, when people have freedom to be able to communicate and talk and work things through and share ideas, good things cannot but come out of that.
[03:22:37.243 --> 03:22:38.844]  So that's wonderful.
[03:22:38.844 --> 03:22:43.067]  You know, but I want to talk about just three quick points about hypocrisy.
[03:22:43.067 --> 03:22:49.452]  You know, it's the people in the media that make their living off the First Amendment that are attacking the First Amendment.
[03:22:49.452 --> 03:22:51.174]  It's the beneficiaries of
[03:22:52.729 --> 03:22:56.192]  Capitalism that wants socialism and communism.
[03:22:56.192 --> 03:23:15.469]  And final point, the beneficiaries, and this is the one that gets my blood boiling, every single person who is against abortion and infancyde is the direct beneficiary of someone making a pro-choice, pro-life, excuse me, decision.
[03:23:16.585 --> 03:23:26.211]  And, you know, I hear these people crying about, oh, you know, it's going to cut into my life and my entertainment dollars and stuff like that, so I need to have an abortion.
[03:23:26.211 --> 03:23:37.637]  You know, I watched a woman, she was in a flood, and I don't know the video exactly of this, she was in a flood, and she climbed this tree, she's nine months pregnant, and she gives birth in the tree!
[03:23:37.637 --> 03:23:39.098]  You know, people have
[03:23:39.855 --> 03:24:00.479]  Challenges in their life, but you have to at some point man up and say I'm the beneficiary of all the generations before me and now I'm going to take the stand of Terminating the people's lives because I just have an inconvenience in my life It's hypocrisy to the nth degree and I want to say the people on the fence right now.
[03:24:00.479 --> 03:24:08.500]  Do not be a hypocrite any longer Take Take your take the one
[03:24:09.394 --> 03:24:15.039]  The thing that God gave us is Jesus Christ, and He is God in knowable form.
[03:24:15.039 --> 03:24:18.121]  Jesus is God, and everything is solved by that.
[03:24:18.121 --> 03:24:26.929]  We had a caller earlier say that he was in a drug haze and being attacked by demons, and he called out in the name of Jesus.
[03:24:26.929 --> 03:24:31.613]  That happened to me in my life, and instantly the power over the demonic broke.
[03:24:31.613 --> 03:24:34.996]  And that is the true God, that is true
[03:24:35.695 --> 03:24:38.757]  Jesus Christ authority over these demons.
[03:24:38.757 --> 03:24:43.921]  These people are filled with demons and they want to censor the name of Jesus above everything.
[03:24:43.921 --> 03:24:46.403]  Don't be a hypocrite any longer.
[03:24:46.403 --> 03:24:52.368]  Even in the Supreme Court with the World War I Memorial Cross in Maryland.
[03:24:53.126 --> 03:24:58.529]  You know, the demonic forces have to drive God out of our society.
[03:24:58.529 --> 03:25:08.454]  When you see a society where you drop below replacement birth rates, that's evidence right there of an unhealthy society.
[03:25:08.454 --> 03:25:17.118]  Even when biologists bring in a group of animals from the wild to breed, the sign of their health or lack of health
[03:25:17.859 --> 03:25:19.642]  Do they reproduce?
[03:25:19.642 --> 03:25:21.646]  And we're not reproducing.
[03:25:21.646 --> 03:25:23.990]  This is a very sick and unhealthy culture.
[03:25:23.990 --> 03:25:28.759]  And I think that there are going to be calamities ahead of us.
[03:25:29.588 --> 03:25:50.801]  And I think there will also be a revival and a rebirth, because there are, in opposition, there are the godly forces, you can say Jesus Christ, you know, you can include a wider scope for godliness, or natural law even, if you're not a particularly religious person.
[03:25:50.801 --> 03:25:57.585]  But the demonic forces are absolutely not only against Christianity, they are against natural law.
[03:25:59.526 --> 03:26:15.751]  You know, I think it was in the Gospel of Matthew where he's recording Jesus as saying, you know, it would be better for anyone that leads these children into sin to have a millstone put around their neck and cast them into a lake.
[03:26:15.751 --> 03:26:19.852]  Well, our whole society right now is sexualizing children.
[03:26:19.852 --> 03:26:22.413]  It's a very deviant and perverted culture.
[03:26:22.413 --> 03:26:25.334]  And, you know, there's going to be a break.
[03:26:26.074 --> 03:26:32.060]  I mean, we've got these sexual deviants and Bolsheviks on the left, and they're not going to quit.
[03:26:32.060 --> 03:26:35.384]  They are in for this next race.
[03:26:35.384 --> 03:26:43.171]  I think they're going to pull out all the stops to do what they did in Orange County, California, anything that's within a few percentage points.
[03:26:43.171 --> 03:26:48.617]  They're just going to haul in truckloads of ballots and then say, we won and that's it.
[03:26:50.698 --> 03:26:56.267]  I don't know at what point the Civil War starts, but we're already seeing false flags.
[03:26:56.267 --> 03:26:58.691]  Jussie Smollett was a classic false flag.
[03:26:59.435 --> 03:27:24.512]  Imagine if he had gotten away with it, if he had not been quite as stupid, if there had been video that they tried to get under the camera but the camera was pointing the wrong way, if there had been video of quote-unquote Trump supporters beating up a black gay man, I mean it would have, it would, we right now would be possibly in the middle of race riots already and his intention was to build up anger against white men, Trump supporters.
[03:27:24.512 --> 03:27:29.215]  You know, this is, this is a classic false flag and thank God it was revealed at the last moment.
[03:27:31.056 --> 03:27:33.697]  We don't have really enough time for another call in this segment.
[03:27:33.697 --> 03:27:35.638]  We are going to come back to calls.
[03:27:35.638 --> 03:27:41.601]  But I just want to tell people, this is the time now to prepare.
[03:27:41.601 --> 03:27:48.224]  We don't know the day or the hour that we're going to flip the light switch in the morning and nothing's going to come on.
[03:27:48.224 --> 03:27:51.025]  The clock radio is going to be black when you wake up.
[03:27:51.025 --> 03:27:52.206]  But that day is coming.
[03:27:52.964 --> 03:28:03.606]  So, you know, if you don't right now have the ability to stay in your house for a month, for example, without going out to find food or water, I think you're kidding yourself.
[03:28:03.606 --> 03:28:06.127]  You're living in a fool's paradise.
[03:28:06.127 --> 03:28:07.127]  It's paradoxical.
[03:28:07.127 --> 03:28:15.608]  We have the most affluent country in the history of the world, where, you know, you don't have to get up from the couch to change channels.
[03:28:15.608 --> 03:28:18.149]  A robot practically will bring you your next beer.
[03:28:18.846 --> 03:28:23.750]  But all of that can be gone in a flash, and now is the time to prepare.
[03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:27.773]  That means visit InfoWars store.
[03:28:27.773 --> 03:28:30.715]  There's a lot there you can get in the way of preps.
[03:28:30.715 --> 03:28:39.881]  Visit all of your regular ammunition and freeze-dried food supply places, because that's what's going to save you.
[03:28:39.881 --> 03:28:43.124]  If you have to go out in the first couple weeks of absolute mayhem,
[03:28:44.045 --> 03:28:48.051]  Your family might not survive, so it's important that you prepare now.
[03:28:48.051 --> 03:28:50.716]  And we'll come back to more calls on the other side of this break.
[03:28:53.063 --> 03:28:56.645]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.645 --> 03:29:00.228]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.228 --> 03:29:02.369]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.

[03:30:07.907 --> 03:30:09.307]  This is high-end.
[03:30:09.307 --> 03:30:12.568]  When you get one box, you get them at basically $3.

[03:32:02.718 --> 03:32:04.559]  Now, I can make them strong.
[03:32:04.559 --> 03:32:06.200]  Now, I can instruct them.
[03:32:06.200 --> 03:32:07.921]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[03:32:07.921 --> 03:32:08.922]  But not once I'm gone.
[03:32:09.022 --> 03:32:14.145]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[03:32:14.145 --> 03:32:19.749]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[03:32:19.749 --> 03:32:23.391]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[03:32:23.391 --> 03:32:28.355]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right, and as long as the people know the truth.
[03:32:28.355 --> 03:32:35.159]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it, and go through the fire for it.
[03:32:35.239 --> 03:32:39.020]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[03:32:39.020 --> 03:32:46.663]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[03:32:46.663 --> 03:32:57.087]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[03:32:57.087 --> 03:32:59.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.838 --> 03:33:20.662]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:20.662 --> 03:33:26.965]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:26.965 --> 03:33:29.126]  What a time to be alive.
[03:33:29.126 --> 03:33:36.290]  Yeah, I was watching some of the Cohen hearings yesterday, that Soviet-style show trial, media trial.
[03:33:37.492 --> 03:34:00.844]  It was pretty amazing at times, not very surprising, but the main takeaway that I get from it is, what would you do if, you know, you weren't a perfect guy and maybe you had done a few scams here and there along the way, but your real crime is being associated with Donald Trump and the feds come at you with full force
[03:34:01.798 --> 03:34:09.121]  And you're already over 60, and they're going to put you in a very hard federal penitentiary for 70 years.
[03:34:09.121 --> 03:34:10.181]  That's what's on the table.
[03:34:10.181 --> 03:34:14.463]  70 years, hard time in a hellhole federal pen.
[03:34:14.463 --> 03:34:28.429]  Or, if you become a wind-up doll, if you accept the script, you'll get three years in a club-fed Otisville
[03:34:29.079 --> 03:34:40.547]  Where instead of doing hard time, you do card time, you know, playing gin with your buds in the open, you know, in the day room.
[03:34:40.547 --> 03:34:43.209]  No cell doors, easy days.
[03:34:43.209 --> 03:34:48.452]  Three years in club fed or die in a federal penitentiary.
[03:34:48.452 --> 03:34:52.415]  You know, maybe not even live out your life because you'll get shanked.
[03:34:52.415 --> 03:34:56.598]  Would you have the character to say, no, I won't do it?
[03:34:57.228 --> 03:35:05.432]  And imagine the pressure right now on Jerome Corsi and our own Roger Stone.
[03:35:05.432 --> 03:35:09.394]  Imagine the pressure that these men are under.
[03:35:09.394 --> 03:35:17.817]  You know, you're going to die in prison unless you become a paid perjurer for corrupt DAs.
[03:35:17.817 --> 03:35:21.219]  I hope that none of us are ever put in that position.
[03:35:22.099 --> 03:35:31.707]  But I hope that we would have the integrity and the courage to never become a liar, just to ease our own burden.
[03:35:31.707 --> 03:35:39.274]  And, you know, there are people in prison, languishing in prison, that have been set up and totally, you know, legally raped.
[03:35:39.274 --> 03:35:42.557]  Not everybody in prison deserves to be there.
[03:35:42.557 --> 03:35:48.722]  And, you know, I've heard from some of them and from some of their wives, people who have been set up and crucified.
[03:35:49.474 --> 03:36:09.952]  You know, and it makes you wonder, what would happen if, you know, if you saw the Fed swarm in your house at five in the morning, and you knew what was coming after that would be eventually a choice between 70 years in prison, dying a hard time Fed Penn, or three years in a club Fed, what would you take?
[03:36:09.952 --> 03:36:12.474]  What would be the price of your integrity and your honor?
[03:36:13.422 --> 03:36:15.023]  And that's what we saw yesterday.
[03:36:15.023 --> 03:36:22.329]  We saw one guy that he obviously took the easy deal and became a mouthpiece for the feds.
[03:36:22.329 --> 03:36:25.012]  Okay, let's go back to the phones now.
[03:36:25.012 --> 03:36:29.595]  I see Daniel in Missouri wants to talk about Joe Rogan.
[03:36:29.595 --> 03:36:31.057]  What else?
[03:36:31.057 --> 03:36:32.738]  Go ahead, Daniel.
[03:36:32.738 --> 03:36:36.982]  Yeah, so I just listened to the podcast with Joe Rogan there.
[03:36:39.801 --> 03:36:51.207]  And I heard Alex talking about when he was having dreams as a child and kind of closing his eyes and falling back into a blackness, a vortex.
[03:36:51.207 --> 03:36:57.370]  I know this sounds crazy and I kind of feel silly talking about it, but I've had the same experiences.
[03:36:57.370 --> 03:37:01.853]  I'm wondering if other people have had the same experiences.
[03:37:01.853 --> 03:37:04.654]  And here's what my mind has gathered from it.
[03:37:04.654 --> 03:37:05.875]  God has called us
[03:37:06.548 --> 03:37:33.083]  Apart from this world early early in our lives and has prepared us all for this time and I'm just calling on all the men in this country to gather yourselves and calm yourselves and Prepare yourselves consecrate yourselves and and and just get your house in order get your mind in order because You are women and our children are in desperate need of us right now.
[03:37:33.083 --> 03:37:33.103]  I
[03:37:33.669 --> 03:37:35.030]  And I want to read something.
[03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:36.312]  This is not biblical.
[03:37:36.312 --> 03:37:36.772]  It's not.
[03:37:36.772 --> 03:37:39.755]  It's out of the meditations of Marcus Aurelius.
[03:37:39.755 --> 03:37:42.197]  It really struck me yesterday.
[03:37:42.197 --> 03:37:50.746]  The reason I'm reading this is because when I try to communicate with people, I get super emotional when I try to relay all this information.
[03:37:50.746 --> 03:37:51.466]  Right?
[03:37:51.466 --> 03:37:53.909]  It makes me mad what they're doing to the babies.
[03:37:53.909 --> 03:37:58.373]  Makes me mad what they're doing to our psyche, our minds, when I think about it.
[03:37:59.136 --> 03:38:04.038]  But, uh, we have to gather ourselves, men out there that are hearing my voice.
[03:38:04.038 --> 03:38:05.438]  I want to read this to you.
[03:38:05.438 --> 03:38:10.860]  It says, and along with not getting angry at others, try not to pander either.
[03:38:10.860 --> 03:38:13.161]  Both are forms of selfishness.
[03:38:13.161 --> 03:38:15.442]  Both of them will do you harm.
[03:38:15.442 --> 03:38:20.343]  When you start to lose your temper, remember, there's nothing manly about rage.
[03:38:20.343 --> 03:38:25.365]  It's courtesy and kindness that define a human being and a man.
[03:38:25.365 --> 03:38:28.086]  That's who possesses strength and nerves and gut.
[03:38:28.590 --> 03:38:30.552]  Not angry whiners.
[03:38:30.552 --> 03:38:36.316]  To react like that brings you closer to impassivity, not so to strength.
[03:38:36.316 --> 03:38:39.378]  Pain is the opposite of strength and so is anger.
[03:38:39.378 --> 03:38:44.222]  Both things we suffer from and yield to.
[03:38:44.222 --> 03:38:45.963]  Go ahead.
[03:38:45.963 --> 03:38:49.806]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[03:38:49.806 --> 03:38:54.330]  We are going to have to gird ourselves for battle on many levels.
[03:38:54.330 --> 03:38:54.630]  When you
[03:38:56.192 --> 03:39:04.816]  see such evil as infanticide being legalized, you know, all the way through third trimester and after.
[03:39:04.816 --> 03:39:23.546]  And when you see, you know, young children being turned into transsexual, you know, props for deviance, and this is praised and lauded on network television, you know, with a clapping studio audience.
[03:39:23.546 --> 03:39:23.946]  I don't know
[03:39:25.043 --> 03:39:33.546]  Where the big battle will be when, you know, the balloon goes up for all of us at once, but all of us in our own time, on our own days, we're going to be faced with these.
[03:39:33.546 --> 03:39:47.150]  I would like to think that if I was in a studio audience where they were, you know, cheering for, you know, transsexual strippers that are 11 years old, that I would get up and shout, do something.
[03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:51.472]  We can't just hold our peace or hold our silence.
[03:39:52.182 --> 03:39:54.685]  Not when evil is so rampant.
[03:39:54.685 --> 03:39:58.550]  This is one of the points of political correctness.
[03:39:58.550 --> 03:40:06.959]  Political correctness is a way of forcing us to shut up about the evil that the left is doing by calling it hate.
[03:40:06.959 --> 03:40:11.745]  Any disagreement with the left, whether it's infanticide or child deviancy,
[03:40:14.012 --> 03:40:17.835]  If you protest against it, you're called a hater.
[03:40:17.835 --> 03:40:32.125]  Even Martina Navratilova, who's a gay tennis player, she's been kicked out of the left club for saying that it's not fair for biological men who claim that they're women to compete against women.
[03:40:32.125 --> 03:40:40.090]  I mean, we're in such a crazy time that we have grown adults on network television looking at a man
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:43.741]  And saying, yes, it's a woman.
[03:40:43.741 --> 03:40:45.781]  This is Alice in Wonderland.
[03:40:45.781 --> 03:40:47.962]  This is through the looking glass.
[03:40:47.962 --> 03:40:50.222]  You know, this is this is a very dark time.
[03:40:50.222 --> 03:40:56.124]  And when a country becomes so delusional, it's going to go off the rails in some other ways.
[03:40:56.124 --> 03:41:00.085]  If the Democrats win in 2020, God help us.
[03:41:00.085 --> 03:41:01.986]  I see total gun control.
[03:41:01.986 --> 03:41:10.568]  I see all kind of of laws being passed that would push us toward some kind of a civil war because we won't just quit.
[03:41:11.306 --> 03:41:15.967]  I'm sorry, you have any final comment there, Daniel?
[03:41:15.967 --> 03:41:19.768]  Pointing all that, so my circle is very low, very small, right?
[03:41:19.768 --> 03:41:22.308]  I'm a family man.
[03:41:22.308 --> 03:41:23.669]  I don't run around with buddies.
[03:41:23.669 --> 03:41:26.209]  I don't have a big social media presence.
[03:41:26.209 --> 03:41:35.011]  So me bringing all that up is for all the men out here to, my mind is kind of get my house in order, right?
[03:41:35.011 --> 03:41:38.252]  So when I speak to my wife or my family about things like this,
[03:41:39.844 --> 03:41:46.746]  When we get emotional and go over the top, you're not communicating well, especially with women.
[03:41:46.746 --> 03:42:00.769]  Our battle, sir, we all can feel it's coming, and right now I feel like it's a chance for men to get their house in order.
[03:42:00.769 --> 03:42:08.791]  Also at the neighborhood level, get out, ride a bike, go running, do something that gets you around the neighborhood.
[03:42:09.631 --> 03:42:11.433]  Find the other men.
[03:42:11.433 --> 03:42:13.635]  Find a reason to walk up and ask them.
[03:42:13.635 --> 03:42:17.359]  If they're just mowing the lawn, ask them what kind of fertilizer they use, anything.
[03:42:17.359 --> 03:42:19.100]  Get to know your neighbors.
[03:42:19.100 --> 03:42:21.142]  There is strength in numbers.
[03:42:21.142 --> 03:42:27.268]  Nothing can defeat, you know, a group of a half dozen men when they find out they've got so much in common.
[03:42:27.268 --> 03:42:28.770]  They all care about their families.
[03:42:28.770 --> 03:42:29.931]  They care about their neighborhood.
[03:42:30.928 --> 03:42:40.918]  But you can't just exist on your sofa inside of your living room watching television and watching the world collapsing around us.
[03:42:40.918 --> 03:42:42.360]  Get out and network now.
[03:42:42.360 --> 03:42:43.961]  It's vitally important.
[03:42:43.961 --> 03:42:45.403]  Find the other preppers.
[03:42:45.403 --> 03:42:47.245]  Find the other conservatives.
[03:42:47.245 --> 03:42:48.446]  It's important.
[03:42:48.446 --> 03:42:50.849]  When we come back, we'll go back to the next call.
[03:43:02.372 --> 03:43:11.374]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:43:11.374 --> 03:43:21.455]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[03:43:30.817 --> 03:43:32.157]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:43:32.157 --> 03:43:33.318]  You must experience it.
[03:43:33.318 --> 03:43:35.298]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:43:35.298 --> 03:43:40.319]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:43:40.319 --> 03:43:41.840]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:43:41.840 --> 03:43:43.320]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:50.002]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[03:47:18.600 --> 03:47:22.481]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:47:27.947 --> 03:47:32.929]  Okay, we're back and we're going to go back to the phones.
[03:47:32.929 --> 03:47:36.150]  To be fair to everybody, there's a ton of people lined up.
[03:47:36.150 --> 03:47:44.593]  We're going to try to get more than one or two calls in during a segment, so I'm not going to make it much of a conversation.
[03:47:44.593 --> 03:47:48.395]  I'll just let people have a chance to speak.
[03:47:48.395 --> 03:47:53.777]  Wild in Wisconsin, been hanging on for a while, wants to discuss Rogan and Jones.
[03:47:53.777 --> 03:47:54.157]  Go ahead.
[03:47:55.646 --> 03:48:03.468]  Yeah, I wanted to drop some pieces in, Matt, that were kind of overlooked or not mentioned.
[03:48:03.468 --> 03:48:11.249]  One thing that's important to remember is just how there was indoctrination camps previously for Marxism.
[03:48:11.249 --> 03:48:16.030]  They're currently going on in the guise of music festivals.
[03:48:16.030 --> 03:48:19.171]  Whether if Vegas was involved in that, I don't know.
[03:48:19.171 --> 03:48:22.671]  But that's one thing to look at.
[03:48:22.671 --> 03:48:23.512]  And secondly, as
[03:48:26.481 --> 03:48:46.752]  George Norris said about his experience in South America, there's a difference between taking an intoxicant and having a trip or spiritual experience, and a difference between near-death experiences and doing it without an intoxicant.
[03:48:46.752 --> 03:48:50.554]  Without an intoxicant, obviously, you're not intoxicated.
[03:48:50.554 --> 03:48:52.915]  Therefore, things are a lot more clear.
[03:48:52.915 --> 03:48:55.016]  Is this coming around to Joe Rogan and Alex?
[03:48:56.673 --> 03:49:07.896]  Yeah, because they were talking about DMT trips and ceremonies like that.
[03:49:07.896 --> 03:49:12.237]  Yeah, personally, I don't recommend tripping.
[03:49:12.237 --> 03:49:15.778]  I know too many people that burned themselves out.
[03:49:15.778 --> 03:49:23.221]  You hold those electrodes to your brain for too long, and you're going to absolutely fry some permanently.
[03:49:25.262 --> 03:49:28.503]  Yeah, I don't have a lot of experience with tripping.
[03:49:28.503 --> 03:49:31.505]  I'm not ashamed to admit.
[03:49:31.505 --> 03:49:35.306]  Yeah, Tracy in Georgia, we're just going to go down the line.
[03:49:35.306 --> 03:49:37.147]  Tracy in Georgia, what does it say?
[03:49:37.147 --> 03:49:38.467]  9-11 changed everything.
[03:49:38.467 --> 03:49:40.308]  Go ahead, Tracy.
[03:49:40.308 --> 03:49:41.869]  Yes, sir.
[03:49:41.869 --> 03:49:43.969]  Hey, how you doing, Mr. Brackey?
[03:49:43.969 --> 03:49:44.710]  I'm fine, thanks.
[03:49:44.710 --> 03:49:45.050]  Go ahead.
[03:49:46.608 --> 03:49:51.572]  Basically, 9-11, to me, put fear into the American heart.
[03:49:51.572 --> 03:49:55.595]  Simply, after that, that's when the political correct culture came.
[03:49:55.595 --> 03:50:15.790]  That's when we were, basically, after our quote-unquote hatred for the Islamic State, the Muslims, and everything like that, we kind of went backwards and the political correct culture came in and basically made us want to basically be nice, if you will.
[03:50:17.591 --> 03:50:28.255]  Well, I see 9-11 as being part of something that's been going on for 1,400 years, unbroken.
[03:50:28.255 --> 03:50:34.057]  And, you know, there's a lot of great cultures and societies have thought, Islam?
[03:50:34.057 --> 03:50:35.058]  That's nothing to worry about.
[03:50:35.058 --> 03:50:36.218]  Who gives a damn?
[03:50:36.218 --> 03:50:37.419]  And guess what?
[03:50:37.419 --> 03:50:38.259]  Now they're Islamic.
[03:50:38.948 --> 03:50:44.611]  It happened in Christian Egypt, it happened in Christian Turkey, and you can go right down the list.
[03:50:44.611 --> 03:50:48.513]  So, there's something about Islam that makes it very unique.
[03:50:48.513 --> 03:50:53.996]  It's a very sinister and powerful formula for conquest.
[03:50:53.996 --> 03:50:57.198]  You don't have to be the smartest, you don't have to be the strongest.
[03:50:57.198 --> 03:51:02.141]  It's like a social virus that gets inside of a healthy society
[03:51:02.871 --> 03:51:17.198]  And gradually takes it over from within and from without by making people afraid to resist it because always in the back of your mind, you know, there's the thought that somebody might come around, you know, with a knife or a bomb.
[03:51:17.198 --> 03:51:20.859]  They'll use bribery, they'll use lies, anything.
[03:51:20.859 --> 03:51:29.143]  So anybody that thinks that that puts something that's a thousand four hundred years old and very successful with very few setbacks
[03:51:29.830 --> 03:51:37.143]  Only Spain and Israel are territories that have been reconquered from Islam.
[03:51:37.143 --> 03:51:38.926]  Once it's in, it's in.
[03:51:38.926 --> 03:51:40.969]  It's got hooks that can't be pulled out.
[03:51:43.017 --> 03:51:50.402]  I see this commonly also with people who blame everything on the bankers or blame everything on the Jews.
[03:51:50.402 --> 03:51:58.467]  It's a very simplistic worldview to say, oh, our country is fine and there is no Muslim threat.
[03:51:58.467 --> 03:52:06.853]  Well, tell that to the many, many countries that were strong and thriving and are now today Islamic.
[03:52:06.853 --> 03:52:08.494]  They were all taken over by it.
[03:52:08.494 --> 03:52:09.715]  It's a very serious threat.
[03:52:11.478 --> 03:52:14.940]  Chris in Illinois, let's go back to Joe Rogan.
[03:52:14.940 --> 03:52:17.561]  Go ahead, Chris.
[03:52:17.561 --> 03:52:18.181]  Hey, Matt.
[03:52:18.181 --> 03:52:18.901]  Good afternoon.
[03:52:18.901 --> 03:52:37.608]  Yeah, that was a great interview and I think the thing that I find is going to be effective is sort of this coalition of conservatives and not even conservatives, the people that are, you know, allowing free speech such as Joe Rogan, Alex going on Joe Rogan culture with Ali Alexander, Infowars,
[03:52:38.089 --> 03:52:47.036]  You know, all of these guys getting together and, you know, coming together and putting any differences aside just to sort of unite, you know?
[03:52:47.036 --> 03:52:48.617]  Does that make sense?
[03:52:48.617 --> 03:52:49.417]  Yeah, sure.
[03:52:49.417 --> 03:52:50.678]  Yesterday was massive.
[03:52:50.678 --> 03:52:56.282]  I mean, there's been more than 3 million views of a 4 hour and 40 minute podcast.
[03:52:56.282 --> 03:52:57.203]  I mean, imagine that.
[03:52:57.888 --> 03:53:03.214]  That's got to make the network talking heads, if they had any sense, take notice.
[03:53:03.214 --> 03:53:08.480]  Those are huge numbers that are happening outside of their control.
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:11.723]  Joe Rogan, I'm not a huge fan.
[03:53:13.505 --> 03:53:16.486]  The fact that, you know, that they can get back together.
[03:53:16.486 --> 03:53:29.069]  And I think Alex not only, you know, helped red pill Joe, but I think that so many people watched the podcast that millions of more people were red-pilled yesterday.
[03:53:29.069 --> 03:53:30.289]  And it's vital.
[03:53:30.289 --> 03:53:32.470]  I mean, that's huge.
[03:53:32.470 --> 03:53:33.070]  It's huge.
[03:53:33.070 --> 03:53:36.491]  And, you know, what you see is what you get with Alex.
[03:53:36.491 --> 03:53:37.891]  He's unfiltered.
[03:53:37.891 --> 03:53:40.392]  You know, when he gets in front of a microphone like that,
[03:53:41.463 --> 03:53:45.746]  It's what is he is thinking is what he is going to express.
[03:53:45.746 --> 03:53:59.395]  Sometimes, obviously, it gets him into trouble because he can he can go down a thought pattern, you know, where he's playing out permutations and it can and it can start sounding absurd.
[03:53:59.395 --> 03:54:03.998]  But what he's doing is he's taking something to logical conclusions.
[03:54:03.998 --> 03:54:07.841]  And this has him branded today as a conspiracy theorist
[03:54:08.467 --> 03:54:18.553]  But look at how many of the conspiracy theories turned out not to be conspiracy theories, but actual true conspiracies or just hidden truth.
[03:54:18.553 --> 03:54:19.693]  I'm sorry for taking your time.
[03:54:19.693 --> 03:54:21.074]  You got a little more there, Chris?
[03:54:21.074 --> 03:54:22.635]  Go ahead.
[03:54:22.635 --> 03:54:34.021]  Yeah, so listen, I'm in Chicago and I work for a food distributor and I'm telling you, man, during that cold snap, we had to close for a day and we supplied a restaurant
[03:54:35.133 --> 03:54:43.040]  And just after one day of pretty much shutting the city down, the grocery stores were in bad shape.
[03:54:43.040 --> 03:54:44.721]  You know, these restaurants were in bad shape.
[03:54:44.721 --> 03:54:45.722]  One day!
[03:54:45.722 --> 03:54:57.092]  So, I think, to heed your advice, to get everybody knowing their neighbors, firearms training, getting a bug out bag, so on and so forth.
[03:54:57.092 --> 03:54:59.894]  The other thing is, I wanted to get your opinion on Joel Skousen.
[03:55:00.410 --> 03:55:03.071]  Well, if there's a mass exodus from the cities because, you know,
[03:55:30.894 --> 03:55:34.235]  For example, the stores are all looted and there's no food.
[03:55:34.235 --> 03:55:38.156]  There's no sanitation and there's no water.
[03:55:38.156 --> 03:55:41.877]  Bugging out is going to be a really grim proposition.
[03:55:41.877 --> 03:55:47.259]  I would advise anybody that's been considering it, get away from big cities.
[03:55:47.259 --> 03:55:48.419]  Do it now.
[03:55:48.419 --> 03:55:50.680]  Even if there's a big cut in pay.
[03:55:50.680 --> 03:55:54.261]  Even if you can't work in your chosen profession at full salary.
[03:55:54.261 --> 03:55:58.802]  I mean, even if you've got to take a major reduction in salary.
[03:55:59.526 --> 03:56:01.467]  Get away from the big cities.
[03:56:01.467 --> 03:56:18.859]  You know, when the S hits the fan, after the first few months, there's going to be a vast reorganization of our country, simply because the blue hives, the cities, they'll be burning, and they're going to be depopulating.
[03:56:18.859 --> 03:56:22.442]  You know, I hope that it never comes to this, but
[03:56:23.189 --> 03:56:38.055]  Looking at all of these social confluences and global and social and cultural economic confluences, I see us heading for something that's disastrous on an unparalleled in history scale.
[03:56:38.055 --> 03:56:42.317]  And I don't want to be anywhere near a megalopolis when it happens.
[03:56:42.317 --> 03:56:46.619]  So number one is, I wouldn't plan on bugging out from Chicago.
[03:56:46.619 --> 03:56:49.560]  You're just going to get caught in some massive gridlock
[03:56:50.354 --> 03:57:02.217]  Uh, you know, where everybody's just at a choke point fighting each other for the, you know, until they're cannibals or get away from big cities is my biggest advice.
[03:57:02.217 --> 03:57:05.237]  Anything else, Chris, as we finish out the hour?
[03:57:05.237 --> 03:57:08.278]  Well, I can tell you that the last word.
[03:57:08.278 --> 03:57:09.058]  Yes, sir.
[03:57:09.058 --> 03:57:09.818]  Thank you for that.
[03:57:09.818 --> 03:57:13.939]  Um, the I have some friends that I've made contact with again.
[03:57:13.939 --> 03:57:18.660]  I haven't hung out with him like 10 years and we used to raise a lot of hell together, and it's kind of weird how we're all sort of
[03:57:19.266 --> 03:57:26.394]  Turning back to God, shall we say, you know, because... Okay, Chris, we got... I get your point there.
[03:57:26.394 --> 03:57:28.215]  We're running right to the end of the hour.
[03:57:28.215 --> 03:57:31.539]  I think people are seeing now how serious it is, you know.
[03:57:31.539 --> 03:57:33.501]  Child deviancy, infanticide.
[03:57:33.501 --> 03:57:36.364]  Folks, if this doesn't wake you up, I don't know what it's going to take.
[03:57:36.364 --> 03:57:38.226]  You know, it's prepare.
[03:57:38.226 --> 03:57:41.449]  Prepare your physical and your spiritual self.
[03:57:41.449 --> 03:57:41.870]  Prepare.
[03:57:43.254 --> 03:57:56.660]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[03:57:56.660 --> 03:58:07.726]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:58:09.016 --> 03:58:10.944]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:58:10.944 --> 03:58:13.635]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:58:15.026 --> 03:58:19.308]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:58:19.308 --> 03:58:23.569]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:58:23.569 --> 03:58:25.850]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:58:25.850 --> 03:58:28.171]  This country is in a war!
[03:58:28.171 --> 03:58:38.855]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:58:38.855 --> 03:58:42.456]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[03:58:44.454 --> 03:58:50.483]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:58:50.483 --> 03:58:53.427]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootworkstore.com.
[03:58:53.427 --> 03:58:57.553]  With MFootwork Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.
