[00:00:11.596 --> 00:00:15.681]  You're listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.062]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:44.854]  Why do I have a case of bottled water here?
[00:00:44.854 --> 00:00:47.614]  I'll tell you about that after the break.
[00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:50.535]  And I'm going to tell you the most important information you've ever heard in your life.
[00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:52.435]  And that's not hype.
[00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:57.016]  It is the most important information on the planet, and we will break it all on the other side.
[00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:59.097]  But first, a key report.
[00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:03.218]  America's streets are mental institutions, and it's because of this right here.
[00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:06.928]  It's because of chemical and biological warfare.
[00:01:06.928 --> 00:01:09.429]  It's now declassified against you.
[00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:10.890]  Stay with us.
[00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.533]  There are over 550,000 homeless on the streets of America's cities.
[00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:18.274]  36,000 of those are youths.
[00:01:18.274 --> 00:01:19.835]  38,000 are veterans.
[00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:21.956]  And 180,000 are families.
[00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:27.900]  And if white privilege exists, why is it that white Americans are the largest racial group of homelessness?
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.142]  Making up 49% of those on the streets.
[00:01:31.142 --> 00:01:39.448]  However, things are tough all over as Black Americans and Native Americans numbers are high compared to their numbers in the general population.
[00:01:39.448 --> 00:01:42.510]  And the homeless population is gradually increasing.
[00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.011]  This is the worst I've ever seen.
[00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:48.875]  There are hundreds and hundreds of gang members and their associates hiding amongst the homeless.
[00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:53.398]  The LAPD says this video shows known gang members brutally beating a man.
[00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:59.321]  Add to this national crisis the stark reality that mental illness is rampant amongst the homeless.
[00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:13.028]  Because roughly 60 years ago, the medical community and the federal government saw to it that long-term state mental institutions were closed in favor of community centers and a growing pharmaceutical industry stranglehold.
[00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:19.192]  There are now 14 slots per 100,000 people available for mental health treatment.
[00:02:19.192 --> 00:02:26.537]  And private mental health facilities, which don't accept insurance, can cost upwards of $30,000 per month.
[00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:30.179]  The mental health crisis has spilled out into our streets.
[00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:42.207]  As a study published in the journal Psychiatric Services estimates 3.4% of Americans, 8 million Americans, suffer from serious psychological problems.
[00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:43.068]  For example,
[00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:47.210]  Aditi Saha says a homeless man threatened her with a knife back in July.
[00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.374]  Saha says her incident took place just about 500 feet away from where this incident happened early Sunday morning.
[00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:58.937]  Surveillance cameras were rolling when a woman was attacked by a homeless man out front of her luxury high-rise.
[00:02:58.937 --> 00:03:03.680]  25-year-old Austin Vincent was arrested and now released by the court pending trial.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:11.464]  She tweeted Governor Gavin Newsom Wednesday night attached a video of her attack for him to see, then asked the governor to save San Francisco.
[00:03:11.564 --> 00:03:12.765]  I don't feel safe.
[00:03:12.765 --> 00:03:16.708]  I know that we're all at risk, especially when this thing opens up.
[00:03:16.708 --> 00:03:17.749]  I mean, think about it.
[00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:26.357]  250 new people, new homeless people, that God knows who they are, what they struggle with, whether it's drugs or mental illness.
[00:03:26.357 --> 00:03:29.339]  And all the city is providing is a shelter.
[00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:34.784]  No treatment, no security, no proper planning.
[00:03:34.784 --> 00:03:35.745]  Just a shelter.
[00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:40.843]  President Trump has brought awareness to what many have ignored for too long.
[00:03:40.843 --> 00:03:42.904]  I was talking about mental institutions.
[00:03:42.904 --> 00:03:52.727]  They closed so many, like 92% of the mental institutions around this country over the years for budgetary reasons.
[00:03:52.727 --> 00:03:55.008]  These are people that have to be in institutions.
[00:03:56.248 --> 00:03:56.749]  For help.
[00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.291]  I'm not talking about as a form of a prison.
[00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.413]  I'm saying for help.
[00:04:01.413 --> 00:04:04.455]  And I think it's something we have to really look at.
[00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:07.078]  The whole concept of mental institutions.
[00:04:07.078 --> 00:04:10.841]  I remember growing up, we had mental institutions.
[00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.924]  Then they were closed in New York, I'm talking about.
[00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:15.425]  Many of them were closed.
[00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:17.006]  A lot of them were closed.
[00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:19.328]  And all of those people were put out on the streets.
[00:04:19.328 --> 00:04:22.571]  And I said, even as a young guy, I said, how does that work?
[00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:23.472]  That's not a good thing.
[00:04:23.732 --> 00:04:24.132]  Now, learn!
[00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:59.389]  The declassified plan to literally murder you and your family slowly.
[00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.430]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.431]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:09.955]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:21.101]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to
[00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:21.561]  We're good to go.
[00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:53.420]  The whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.201]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:57.122]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[00:05:57.122 --> 00:06:12.370]  Even it is what you just saw.
[00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.671]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:17.172]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:17.172 --> 00:06:18.613]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:34.380]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this August 20th, 2019 broadcast.
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:49.075]  And I've been talking the last few weeks about the accelerated global awakening that's taking place and the fact that basically everything that we've trailblazed breaking down is now being admitted and is now coming out in triplicate.
[00:06:51.730 --> 00:07:00.337]  If you took your six-month-old baby and dropped it on its head on purpose, you would lose that child if you were seen doing it.
[00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:01.818]  And you should.
[00:07:01.818 --> 00:07:11.305]  If you took your child in to have a partial lobotomy done, they would arrest the doctors that tried to do it and arrest you.
[00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:19.572]  But if you give that child gender-bending chemicals that also lower their IQ and lower their fertility,
[00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.923]  And then take them in at age 8 to have their genitals cut off.
[00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:27.365]  You're called a trendy, cutting-edge person.
[00:07:27.365 --> 00:07:29.347]  This is all part of transhumanism.
[00:07:29.347 --> 00:07:30.007]  How do I know?
[00:07:30.007 --> 00:07:45.382]  The Tavistock Institute, the Carnegie Endowment, the Skinnerian Institutes, they have all admitted the plan.
[00:07:45.382 --> 00:07:46.763]  We ought to re-air Endgame.
[00:07:50.185 --> 00:08:01.429]  2.0, which was just a talk with the late, great Professor Michael Kaufman, going over 1960 documents for this whole plan.
[00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:07.291]  First the sexual revolution, so people wouldn't take care of their kids, so they'd run off and leave their husband or wife.
[00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:17.234]  Then once you broke up the family, then you'd start giving chemicals to the children to confuse their sexual proclivities towards depopulation.
[00:08:18.916 --> 00:08:23.380]  Now, I talk about awakening points.
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:43.957]  I've gotten, no exaggeration, I don't know, 20 phone calls or more to my personal cell phone, that's really a robot government tracking device, it's a Trojan horse given to me, given to us all, but let's define things as they are, and just flooding in emails and calls, and everyone breathlessly, the Journal of American
[00:08:45.185 --> 00:08:54.371]  Madison and Harvard, they all just came out and said, you gotta take the fluoride out of the water, it's lowering IQs massively.
[00:08:54.371 --> 00:09:03.777]  Oh, and it's double worse with men, boys, and quadruple worse with blacks.
[00:09:03.777 --> 00:09:14.124]  Now, folks, if you're wondering why it's like a zombie apocalypse out there and why there's mental illness everywhere and why people seem so incredibly stupid,
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:39.101]  It's because the Soviets, the Communists, the proto-globalists that took over, had work camps and they put hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water and lots of other stuff to test it on the people in the gulags and the gulags archipelago.
[00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:41.023]  And that's in Pulitzer Prize winning history books.
[00:09:42.838 --> 00:09:55.824]  Before World War II started, at the very beginning, there was an alliance between Russia and the Nazis, and they exchanged information, and the Nazis put hydrofluorosilic acid in the water.
[00:09:55.824 --> 00:10:01.826]  That came out in Nuremberg, because it made people docile.
[00:10:01.826 --> 00:10:11.350]  Now, I went to HEB this morning, the crew did, walked right in, it says, HEB, baby,
[00:10:12.662 --> 00:10:15.143]  Fluoride water.
[00:10:15.143 --> 00:10:16.643]  Let's zoom right in on that.
[00:10:16.643 --> 00:10:18.083]  And notice it shows you the target.
[00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:28.465]  It's kind of like buying a box of 30-odd-6 rifle shells, rifle rounds, and on the cover is a deer.
[00:10:28.465 --> 00:10:32.066]  And there's a little crosshair on the side of the deer.
[00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:34.706]  Or if you go buy cockroach poison.
[00:10:34.706 --> 00:10:37.527]  A lot of it is fluoride, by the way.
[00:10:38.345 --> 00:10:43.569]  And it'll show the cockroach on the front with a target on it, or if you're getting stuff to kill wasps.
[00:10:43.569 --> 00:10:45.911]  It'll show a target on wasps, right?
[00:10:45.911 --> 00:11:05.647]  Well, right here, the HEB, fluoride-added water, for your boy, is nothing but a box of rifle shells, firing electrified molecules of weaponized fluoride into the brain.
[00:11:05.647 --> 00:11:06.928]  But let me give you the rest of the story.
[00:11:12.614 --> 00:11:17.217]  Everybody when they did this in the 40s knew it was going on, so they freaked out about it.
[00:11:17.217 --> 00:11:24.063]  Everybody knew that mainline poison you sprinkled around the house was just standard fluoride.
[00:11:24.063 --> 00:11:27.966]  Well, you're going to put electrified fluoride?
[00:11:27.966 --> 00:11:30.167]  Fluoride's going to turn into a psychoactive acid?
[00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:30.848]  But there's more.
[00:11:31.812 --> 00:11:34.013]  Then they don't have to put as many of the other chemicals in.
[00:11:34.013 --> 00:11:36.214]  They're putting all sorts of drugs in the water.
[00:11:36.214 --> 00:11:38.655]  And there's waivers in the Clean Water Act.
[00:11:38.655 --> 00:11:45.498]  There's waivers in Prop 65 in California, where you can't have one billionth of lead in your product.
[00:11:45.498 --> 00:11:46.659]  I mean, the air has more than that.
[00:11:47.455 --> 00:11:48.636]  So the lawyers can sue you.
[00:11:48.636 --> 00:11:58.202]  But if you want to dump hydrofluorosilic acid and other Grignard reagents, because there's a waiver to 400 plus chemicals, in, it's good.
[00:11:58.202 --> 00:12:03.525]  So they dump the toxic waste in the water and all the leftists religiously filter their water.
[00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:05.286]  They don't shower in it.
[00:12:05.286 --> 00:12:06.907]  It's for you.
[00:12:06.907 --> 00:12:08.668]  It's for me.
[00:12:08.668 --> 00:12:09.689]  And it's for boys.
[00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:19.622]  We've covered this probably, let's not exaggerate, a thousand times over the last 20 years on air.
[00:12:19.622 --> 00:12:27.046]  And it comes out in a major study in JAMA.
[00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:37.632]  The most prestigious there is in quadruple blind studies over years and they show exactly what the Japanese, the Chinese, the Mexican, the Brazilian, the German studies show.
[00:12:39.862 --> 00:12:41.943]  Massive cancer increases.
[00:12:41.943 --> 00:12:43.684]  Massive bone cancer.
[00:12:43.684 --> 00:12:45.204]  Massive infertility.
[00:12:45.204 --> 00:12:47.725]  Massive IQ reductions.
[00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:53.847]  Four times in a black male what it is in a white woman.
[00:12:53.847 --> 00:12:55.708]  Now why is that?
[00:12:55.708 --> 00:13:02.911]  Because men don't have blood-brain barriers as strong as women.
[00:13:02.911 --> 00:13:05.932]  Any physician will tell you, going back 5,000 years, that women
[00:13:08.991 --> 00:13:13.895]  Babies are twice as strong as male babies when it comes to the injuries.
[00:13:13.895 --> 00:13:17.038]  Women can take more bullet holes, more blood loss, all of it.
[00:13:17.038 --> 00:13:22.943]  We're designed different because they're meant to be able to carry a baby and then have that traumatic event happen.
[00:13:22.943 --> 00:13:32.531]  Women are tough, not in the physical ways we are, but in the other ways to survive on less food, less water, everything.
[00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:33.572]  This hurts women.
[00:13:33.572 --> 00:13:34.373]  It hurts them bad.
[00:13:34.373 --> 00:13:36.555]  But boy, you talk about Black Lives Matter, baby.
[00:13:39.073 --> 00:13:44.959]  Can you imagine what it's like to be black and to have drunk this when you were a child?
[00:13:44.959 --> 00:13:49.124]  They're talking about a 40 point IQ reduction.
[00:13:49.124 --> 00:13:51.166]  Mental retardation in most people.
[00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:53.808]  If you're going to have 140 IQ, you have 100.
[00:13:53.808 --> 00:14:00.936]  If you were going to have 100, you are going to be mentally retarded, below 70, unable to tie your shoelaces.
[00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:04.152]  That's all in the studies.
[00:14:04.152 --> 00:14:06.913]  I don't just have the new one, I've got a whole bunch of them.
[00:14:06.913 --> 00:14:11.256]  It's a fact, and it was done on purpose.
[00:14:11.256 --> 00:14:12.216]  And we take it.
[00:14:12.216 --> 00:14:17.980]  Now let me give you the next big piece of the enchilada.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.782]  5G is fluoride 2.0.
[00:14:21.782 --> 00:14:30.587]  5G literally destroys the cells in the body, vibrating at a perfect frequency to break molecules in half.
[00:14:31.618 --> 00:14:38.183]  You know how you put a hot dog in the microwave for 30 seconds and it plumps up and does all that?
[00:14:38.183 --> 00:14:45.508]  All the studies show that regular cell phone radiation heats the brain one degree after 15 minutes of cell use.
[00:14:45.508 --> 00:14:47.069]  If you have it up against your head.
[00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:49.111]  Oh, it's killing you.
[00:14:49.111 --> 00:14:50.672]  But slowly.
[00:14:50.672 --> 00:14:55.355]  Like leaving a grilled cheese on all day, but it finally gets delicious.
[00:14:55.355 --> 00:14:57.317]  So remember, these are all bullets right here.
[00:14:58.561 --> 00:15:00.503]  Now if I took a baby in here, I would never do that.
[00:15:00.503 --> 00:15:03.005]  Put it in the crib right there.
[00:15:03.005 --> 00:15:08.771]  And if I threw bottles of this chemical weapon at it, they'd arrest me.
[00:15:08.771 --> 00:15:09.712]  I was just throwing at the baby.
[00:15:09.712 --> 00:15:11.374]  Of course, that really wouldn't hurt the baby.
[00:15:11.374 --> 00:15:12.395]  Maybe scratch it.
[00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:13.576]  But it'd be wrong.
[00:15:13.576 --> 00:15:19.082]  But if mommy goes and gets it because it says it's for babies, then I've got the studies for you.
[00:15:20.524 --> 00:15:25.848]  They've been trying to hedge their bets the last decade, going, well, actually, kids shouldn't drink fluoridated water before their teeth erupt.
[00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:30.111]  It causes dental fluorosis, weakening of the enamel, and chalking.
[00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:31.913]  By the way, my dad's a dentist.
[00:15:31.913 --> 00:15:35.175]  And I got those studies I'm gonna show you.
[00:15:35.175 --> 00:15:43.581]  So, you specifically shouldn't give it to a baby, even if you think it's good for your teeth later, which it's not.
[00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:45.303]  It's a chemical weapon.
[00:15:45.303 --> 00:15:46.524]  And it's going on everywhere.
[00:15:46.524 --> 00:15:47.905]  So you wonder why people are so dumb.
[00:15:48.883 --> 00:15:55.478]  Folks, the average black man who was raised in a city with a poor nation has a 35 to 40 point lower.
[00:15:57.941 --> 00:16:00.583]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[00:16:00.583 --> 00:16:09.131]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:16:09.131 --> 00:16:18.439]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:23.504]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:16:23.704 --> 00:16:35.920]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.161]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:39.144]  Check out the PPX Microgrid System

[00:16:59.674 --> 00:17:06.581]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:17:06.581 --> 00:17:14.948]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:17:29.284 --> 00:17:31.486]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:17:31.486 --> 00:17:39.235]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:17:59.665 --> 00:18:07.073]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:18:07.073 --> 00:18:11.358]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[00:18:11.358 --> 00:18:15.082]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:22.432]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:18:22.432 --> 00:18:23.652]  This is racketeering.
[00:18:23.652 --> 00:18:24.772]  This is cartels.
[00:18:24.772 --> 00:18:27.173]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:18:27.173 --> 00:18:29.054]  We need it now.
[00:18:29.054 --> 00:18:30.755]  You can take on Big Tech.
[00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:39.698]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:18:39.698 --> 00:18:47.741]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:18:47.741 --> 00:18:48.601]  The way to fight back
[00:18:49.241 --> 00:18:54.091]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:57.859]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:11.863]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[00:19:11.863 --> 00:19:14.784]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:19:14.784 --> 00:19:16.544]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:19:16.544 --> 00:19:20.185]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[00:19:20.845 --> 00:19:25.390]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.410]  That's beautiful.
[00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.332]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:19:28.332 --> 00:19:29.934]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:19:29.934 --> 00:19:37.541]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[00:19:37.541 --> 00:19:39.843]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[00:19:39.843 --> 00:19:44.027]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:19:44.027 --> 00:19:44.968]  And I'm asking listeners,
[00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:49.853]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:19:49.853 --> 00:19:50.954]  We are the resistance.
[00:19:50.954 --> 00:20:02.284]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:04.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:28.154]  Well, if you just joined us, I think it's over in Daria's office.
[00:20:28.154 --> 00:20:33.477]  There's a copy of Ecoscience from 1974, the year I was born.
[00:20:33.477 --> 00:20:41.221]  Many decades later, the author became the head of Obama's science committee, his chief science officer.
[00:20:43.137 --> 00:20:45.058]  I took direct orders from Bill Gates.
[00:20:45.058 --> 00:20:45.919]  Eco-science.
[00:20:45.919 --> 00:20:47.020]  You can pull it up online.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:52.003]  It talks about fluoride in the water to lower your IQ and to lower fertility.
[00:20:52.003 --> 00:20:53.965]  And it calls for increasing it.
[00:20:53.965 --> 00:20:55.366]  And boy, have they.
[00:20:55.366 --> 00:20:57.767]  And the IQs have gone straight down.
[00:20:57.767 --> 00:20:59.288]  Just like idiocracy.
[00:20:59.288 --> 00:21:02.030]  But it didn't take 400 years.
[00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.432]  It happened in just a few decades.
[00:21:04.432 --> 00:21:06.353]  And now it's getting worse.
[00:21:06.353 --> 00:21:07.914]  First, they stun you with a soft kill.
[00:21:07.914 --> 00:21:11.137]  So, if you just tuned in, study
[00:21:12.298 --> 00:21:18.922]  Prompts calls for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women because massive IQ reductions in boys particularly.
[00:21:18.922 --> 00:21:22.484]  Oh my goodness, that's Reuters.
[00:21:22.484 --> 00:21:26.547]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[00:21:26.547 --> 00:21:29.869]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:32.171]  And here's a Harvard study from eight years ago.
[00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:34.672]  Impact of fluoride on neurological development in children.
[00:21:34.672 --> 00:21:36.473]  Found the exact same thing.
[00:21:36.473 --> 00:21:38.935]  Got the studies out of Mexico, out of China.
[00:21:38.935 --> 00:21:40.196]  Oh, oh, but...
[00:21:41.044 --> 00:21:44.725]  I've also got the study showing it hurts your teeth.
[00:21:44.725 --> 00:21:48.347]  But let me show you this.
[00:21:48.347 --> 00:21:51.328]  Let me show you this.
[00:21:51.328 --> 00:21:56.570]  If you're a TV viewer, Alex Jones top ten health claims and why they're wrong.
[00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.450]  And when you read number five,
[00:22:00.424 --> 00:22:05.547]  From Forbes, the fluoride in drinking water is making people dumb.
[00:22:05.547 --> 00:22:10.389]  Alex Jones stated, I grew up in Dallas, Texas, drinking sodium fluoridated water.
[00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:15.452]  All the scientific studies show my IQ has been reduced by at least 20 points.
[00:22:15.452 --> 00:22:24.437]  Yeah, they found in the Harvard study, six years of ingesting 1.3 parts per million, lowered IQ on average about 10 points.
[00:22:24.437 --> 00:22:28.599]  So, you know, I'm saying, well, I drank it longer than that, so that's 20 points, because it's cumulative.
[00:22:29.258 --> 00:22:31.840]  And of course, they don't tell you I was showing the study on air.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:35.884]  They just go, oh look, they go on to say it's preposterous and ridiculous.
[00:22:35.884 --> 00:22:39.507]  Ooh, they use the word ridiculous.
[00:22:39.507 --> 00:22:41.268]  Well that proves that I'm this big liar.
[00:22:41.268 --> 00:22:49.015]  They said I'm, but wait, they take the David Hogg statement and they say, but Jones sells water filters.
[00:22:49.015 --> 00:22:54.360]  Yeah, it's like selling life jackets to people when they buy a boat.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:54.420]  Or
[00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.211]  Hey, you're going camping.
[00:22:56.211 --> 00:22:59.275]  Want some bug spray to keep the bugs off?
[00:22:59.275 --> 00:23:00.517]  Hey, you got teeth.
[00:23:00.517 --> 00:23:02.199]  I'm selling toothbrushes.
[00:23:02.199 --> 00:23:04.763]  But oh, it's the scams.
[00:23:04.763 --> 00:23:08.027]  We sell the highest rated water filters at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:23:08.027 --> 00:23:09.489]  It's what I use.
[00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:10.250]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.191]  Let's go back to what they have.
[00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:14.771]  Babies are rushed, and H-E-B, and everywhere.
[00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:18.754]  There's whole aisles of the different, oh, fluoride for your baby.
[00:23:18.754 --> 00:23:19.814]  And then they've tested this.
[00:23:19.814 --> 00:23:22.516]  This is way over 1.3.
[00:23:22.516 --> 00:23:25.898]  So you get real brain cooking with this.
[00:23:25.898 --> 00:23:28.320]  It's for your baby.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:32.742]  And if you taste it, here, let me be a snake charmer here and drink poison.
[00:23:32.742 --> 00:23:35.084]  Bible says no weapon for me, this will prosper.
[00:23:35.084 --> 00:23:37.005]  Unless they're targeting children, they're unconscious.
[00:23:37.005 --> 00:23:38.186]  And then years ago, I tasted it.
[00:23:38.186 --> 00:23:41.888]  Tastes like Houston water, pumped out of a toilet.
[00:23:45.542 --> 00:23:46.964]  Oh, baby!
[00:23:46.964 --> 00:23:51.487]  It's time to kill brain cells!
[00:23:51.487 --> 00:24:04.378]  So, Dr. McHem Shot, it would be much nicer to these babies, you know, that the left wants to kill in the womb or kill after they're born, keep them comfortable, to just basically put them in front of a firing squad.
[00:24:04.378 --> 00:24:11.424]  But instead, oh, it's so much more fun, so much more fun to take our time,
[00:24:12.526 --> 00:24:15.727]  So much more fun to take our time.
[00:24:15.727 --> 00:24:20.188]  And then it's bye-bye brain, and you've got a good automaton.
[00:24:20.188 --> 00:24:20.848]  Remember the movie?
[00:24:20.848 --> 00:24:21.548]  It was a good movie.
[00:24:21.548 --> 00:24:22.329]  It was a Disney movie.
[00:24:22.329 --> 00:24:24.429]  It countered Star Wars.
[00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:24.769]  1978.
[00:24:24.769 --> 00:24:28.490]  The Black Hole.
[00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.811]  With Maximilian Schell.
[00:24:30.811 --> 00:24:32.991]  And this mission to the Black Hole never came back.
[00:24:32.991 --> 00:24:34.992]  And they get there, and where's the crew?
[00:24:34.992 --> 00:24:36.672]  Oh, they all died.
[00:24:36.672 --> 00:24:38.333]  But they notice that the robots have a limp.
[00:24:39.235 --> 00:24:40.395]  Look, humanoid.
[00:24:40.395 --> 00:24:44.277]  Well, they've given them lobotomies.
[00:24:44.277 --> 00:24:45.157]  Isn't that loving?
[00:24:45.157 --> 00:24:47.618]  But see, that's a black hole movie.
[00:24:47.618 --> 00:24:49.098]  That's scary.
[00:24:49.098 --> 00:24:50.879]  Oh my goodness.
[00:24:50.879 --> 00:24:54.180]  But when it's done like, Mommy!
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.160]  Give them what they need!
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.402]  And oh, keep that Alex Jones off the air.
[00:25:00.402 --> 00:25:04.743]  In China, they work to filter the fluoride out of their water because it's naturally in their soil there.
[00:25:06.584 --> 00:25:09.365]  It's in a lot of our soil, too, but that's just the normal calcium fluoride.
[00:25:09.365 --> 00:25:14.107]  And then they add iodine to the local reservoirs.
[00:25:14.107 --> 00:25:15.208]  You can look at the videos online.
[00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:24.932]  They'll have tanks, depending on the size of the lake or the pond, the water container, with a big tank that puts fluoride in.
[00:25:24.932 --> 00:25:26.213]  Oh, but Alex Jones is bad, too.
[00:25:26.213 --> 00:25:27.913]  He sells good iodine.
[00:25:27.913 --> 00:25:31.055]  Don't listen to him, because it's the good halogen, not the bad one.
[00:25:31.055 --> 00:25:33.396]  Oh, and one of our great crew members,
[00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:36.332]  Added this point.
[00:25:36.332 --> 00:25:38.513]  He's a big swimmer and a big health aficionado.
[00:25:38.513 --> 00:25:43.355]  And Connor was telling me earlier, he goes, you know, it's funny about women having twice as good a blood brain barrier.
[00:25:43.355 --> 00:25:45.156]  That's why the toxins don't hurt them as bad.
[00:25:45.156 --> 00:25:46.997]  It's because they have this particular chemical in it.
[00:25:46.997 --> 00:25:53.379]  And he goes, I was reading in a major medical journal that that's what krill oil is and why it's so important to boost IQ.
[00:25:53.379 --> 00:26:00.503]  My 27 month old daughter this morning was looking at a book and it had an American Eagle in it.
[00:26:00.503 --> 00:26:03.104]  And she pointed at it and said, that's the hero.
[00:26:05.186 --> 00:26:08.049]  And my wife said, what does that mean?
[00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:11.872]  And she pointed at me and says, Daddy, she's never watched the show, any of that.
[00:26:11.872 --> 00:26:16.737]  She's like a Martian, head in the hundred percentile, walking around.
[00:26:16.737 --> 00:26:18.298]  People think she's five years old.
[00:26:18.298 --> 00:26:23.163]  In fact, I think my wife's going to let me bring her on air because you got, she's phenomenal.
[00:26:23.163 --> 00:26:24.003]  And everybody loves their kids.
[00:26:24.003 --> 00:26:25.785]  We'll tell you this, all my kids, you've seen Rex.
[00:26:27.401 --> 00:26:28.541]  Piece of work as well.
[00:26:28.541 --> 00:26:34.423]  But I'm telling you, this little cupcake, and she's been getting fish oil since she was a week old.
[00:26:34.423 --> 00:26:38.144]  The purest, best in her little bottles.
[00:26:38.144 --> 00:26:39.444]  And now it goes in her cups.
[00:26:39.444 --> 00:26:46.566]  I just prick the krill oil, put a half a dose in there, and boy, she's on fire.
[00:26:46.566 --> 00:26:49.187]  And so yes, I do sell Ultimate Krill Oil as well.
[00:26:49.187 --> 00:26:54.049]  Or you can just listen to the New World Order, and you can do whatever they tell you.
[00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:55.169]  Do you ever get the David Hogg queued up?
[00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:57.891]  We have it.
[00:26:57.891 --> 00:26:59.412]  Here's David Hogg though and here's Forbes.
[00:26:59.412 --> 00:27:09.923]  The talking point is this man is so evil that he tells you there's radioactive isotopes in most of the water and there's hundreds of chemicals on average and glyphosate that grows breast cancer.
[00:27:09.923 --> 00:27:11.585]  It's miracle grow for breast cancer.
[00:27:11.585 --> 00:27:13.567]  It literally does it.
[00:27:13.567 --> 00:27:15.269]  Mimics the hormone that makes the cancer grow.
[00:27:16.707 --> 00:27:23.412]  Oh, oh, and I found another article where frogs are raping other male frogs, but also boa constrictors.
[00:27:23.412 --> 00:27:24.733]  In fact, I sent you guys that article.
[00:27:24.733 --> 00:27:30.237]  Maybe we'll find it during the break, but they're just attacking everyone because of the atrazine running off.
[00:27:30.237 --> 00:27:31.678]  That's mainstream news.
[00:27:31.678 --> 00:27:34.299]  Oh, but David Hogg says I'm bad, see?
[00:27:34.299 --> 00:27:35.040]  No, no, no.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:35.700]  Drink it.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.101]  Don't filter it.
[00:27:37.101 --> 00:27:39.423]  And certainly don't support someone that exposes it.
[00:27:39.423 --> 00:27:40.544]  Don't buy your filters from him.
[00:27:40.544 --> 00:27:41.584]  Let him go bankrupt.
[00:27:41.584 --> 00:27:42.845]  Shut him up!
[00:27:42.845 --> 00:27:43.406]  Here's David Hogg.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:56.105]  When individuals say these things to us, I think it's important for their viewing audience to realize they're simply trying to make money off them.
[00:27:56.105 --> 00:28:03.513]  For example, one of the main people in this situation that I don't want to name the name of, but as you said is from Infowars, he shouts a lot.
[00:28:03.513 --> 00:28:04.254]  I'll just give you that hint.
[00:28:04.254 --> 00:28:04.734]  He looks red.
[00:28:07.205 --> 00:28:17.027]  He's advertising many of these things, and the power lies in these advertisers to pull out of these fear-mongering, hate-loving people that just want to spread hate and division in America.
[00:28:17.027 --> 00:28:27.850]  For example, on Infowars, one of the main things that he spoke, one of his famous things is saying that, uh, one of his most famous statements was saying that, Tapwater is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too.
[00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:29.570]  First off, gay people are awesome.
[00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.411]  I don't think that's a problem at all.
[00:28:31.411 --> 00:28:36.252]  And secondly, if you notice at the end of that video, he advertises water filters.
[00:28:36.852 --> 00:28:37.733]  Good to go.
[00:28:37.733 --> 00:28:38.193]  Interesting.
[00:28:57.904 --> 00:29:03.647]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[00:29:08.751 --> 00:29:16.475]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[00:29:16.475 --> 00:29:24.360]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.321]  Not a security IPO or note.
[00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:35.827]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[00:29:35.827 --> 00:29:36.667]  Don't miss this one.

[00:29:37.968 --> 00:29:38.428]  Call 800-600-3388.
[00:29:38.428 --> 00:29:38.769]  That's 800-600-3388.
[00:29:38.769 --> 00:29:40.670]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.

[00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:41.070]  800-600-3388.
[00:29:51.197 --> 00:29:52.619]  Equipment offered poses a financial risk.
[00:29:52.619 --> 00:29:54.563]  Owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[00:29:54.563 --> 00:29:57.089]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[00:29:58.985 --> 00:30:10.212]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[00:30:10.212 --> 00:30:14.334]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[00:30:14.334 --> 00:30:23.700]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.461]  The system is vulnerable.
[00:30:26.461 --> 00:30:29.141]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:32.782]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[00:30:32.782 --> 00:30:39.664]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[00:30:39.664 --> 00:30:45.006]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.
[00:30:45.626 --> 00:30:50.850]  Buy storable foods and an Alexa Pure Gravity Water Filter today.
[00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:53.812]  Support mankind by being prepared.
[00:30:53.812 --> 00:30:57.155]  And support freedom by buying from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:30:58.769 --> 00:31:11.962]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[00:31:11.962 --> 00:31:14.865]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:31:14.865 --> 00:31:16.627]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:31:16.627 --> 00:31:20.270]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[00:31:20.911 --> 00:31:25.455]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:31:25.455 --> 00:31:26.516]  That's beautiful.
[00:31:26.516 --> 00:31:28.418]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:31:28.418 --> 00:31:30.020]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:37.627]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[00:31:37.627 --> 00:31:39.949]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[00:31:39.949 --> 00:31:44.113]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:31:44.113 --> 00:31:45.053]  And I'm asking listeners,
[00:31:45.834 --> 00:31:49.939]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:31:49.939 --> 00:31:51.041]  We are the resistance.
[00:31:51.041 --> 00:31:51.762]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:31:58.732 --> 00:32:02.915]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:32:02.915 --> 00:32:03.975]  They are technocrats.
[00:32:03.975 --> 00:32:06.257]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:32:06.257 --> 00:32:13.621]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:32:13.621 --> 00:32:15.502]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:32:15.502 --> 00:32:17.584]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:32:18.104 --> 00:32:24.447]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:32:24.447 --> 00:32:29.649]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:32:29.649 --> 00:32:38.654]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:32:39.634 --> 00:32:45.617]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:32:45.617 --> 00:32:46.557]  It is amazing.
[00:32:46.557 --> 00:32:56.621]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:56.621 --> 00:32:58.262]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:22.545]  Devastating globalist lies, exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine.
[00:33:22.545 --> 00:33:32.314]  Tirelessly waging war on corruption, from deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6 in Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide.
[00:33:32.314 --> 00:33:34.476]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:34.476 --> 00:33:38.519]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:42.682 --> 00:33:59.079]  I don't know about you, but I'm angry that I read this book written 45 years ago when I was born by the later White House science czar, John P. Holdren, saying that they put the fluoride in the water to lower our RQs and fertility.
[00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:03.184]  Of course, one of the most studied compounds elements out there.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.822]  And then everybody's calling me, oh my gosh, Reuters AP!
[00:34:07.822 --> 00:34:11.845]  Study prompts calls for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women.
[00:34:11.845 --> 00:34:16.069]  Massive IQ reductions in boys particularly because of the blood-brain barrier being weaker.
[00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:20.472]  The Daily Beast, study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[00:34:20.472 --> 00:34:22.894]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[00:34:24.755 --> 00:34:26.896]  You know, you've got moms making their boys transgender.
[00:34:26.896 --> 00:34:29.917]  How about translobotomies?
[00:34:29.917 --> 00:34:35.399]  There are people that burn their eyes out with Drano to be transabled.
[00:34:35.399 --> 00:34:39.140]  Moms already give their boys Ritalin to stunt their IQ and teach them how to behave.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:45.622]  They're already telling them to chop their genitals off, so how about more fluoride for that baby boy?
[00:34:47.651 --> 00:34:50.315]  Study links fluorinated water during pregnancy to lower IQ is another story.
[00:34:50.315 --> 00:34:51.496]  Oh, another one!
[00:34:51.496 --> 00:34:52.698]  This is from eight years ago.
[00:34:52.698 --> 00:34:55.001]  Impact of fluoride on neurological development in children.
[00:34:55.001 --> 00:34:55.722]  Harvard study.
[00:34:55.722 --> 00:34:58.506]  Massive IQ reductions.
[00:34:58.506 --> 00:35:01.210]  But the best part's the bone cancer and the infertility.
[00:35:02.284 --> 00:35:06.585]  And you look how the IQ in the US is dropping the fastest in the world.
[00:35:06.585 --> 00:35:08.185]  Major studies on that.
[00:35:08.185 --> 00:35:11.246]  Oh, but Forbes came out and they said I'm a kook.
[00:35:11.246 --> 00:35:13.006]  Now we can put this article up on screen.
[00:35:13.006 --> 00:35:15.246]  Maybe put the color version up so folks can see it.
[00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:16.447]  Kind of blurs out there.
[00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.227]  There you go.
[00:35:17.227 --> 00:35:22.068]  Horny, confused cane toads are humping a python.
[00:35:22.068 --> 00:35:25.688]  Biologists say it's atrazine runoff.
[00:35:25.688 --> 00:35:28.189]  Causes them to, well, the males to,
[00:35:29.321 --> 00:35:33.487]  Only have sex with other males and then to rape other animals.
[00:35:33.487 --> 00:35:34.108]  There you go.
[00:35:34.108 --> 00:35:38.754]  But again, I'm the bad guy for just telling you what was in Mainline Studies decades ago.
[00:35:38.754 --> 00:35:40.336]  And here you've got it right here.
[00:35:40.336 --> 00:35:41.238]  Fluoride water.
[00:35:42.523 --> 00:36:00.270]  For your babies, and after Gavin McGinnis leaves us, I will get to the other studies on that for you, about how you shouldn't have any fluoride until your teeth come in, because it causes dental fluorosis in the development of the bones, and makes the teeth brittle.
[00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:01.531]  But that's okay!
[00:36:01.531 --> 00:36:03.371]  Oh, it's baby with fluoride!
[00:36:03.371 --> 00:36:10.674]  We're going to cover, and there's all this Colgate, with the fluoride in it for your kids, and you wonder why they get so stupid.
[00:36:10.674 --> 00:36:12.155]  Of course, you might want to go to m4store.com,
[00:36:13.064 --> 00:36:22.314]  And fund the operation to warn people while protecting yourself with ultimate krill oil that the major studies say is the only thing that increases the blood-brain barrier.
[00:36:22.314 --> 00:36:24.076]  Oh, don't want Junior taking that.
[00:36:24.076 --> 00:36:29.101]  Don't want to put any of that in the baby's milk, because you'll have a brainiac.
[00:36:29.101 --> 00:36:30.163]  The giant brain.
[00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:36.465]  Now, joining us is Gavin McGinnis, and I appreciate him coming on on short notice.
[00:36:36.465 --> 00:36:41.552]  Mom of three arrested, jailed for putting recycling in wrong color bag.
[00:36:41.552 --> 00:36:44.676]  That's up on DrivesReport.com, just to show you how they're going after the good guys.
[00:36:44.676 --> 00:36:48.621]  And then, proud boys, Maxwell Hare, John Kingsman,
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.861]  Convicted of U.E.S.
[00:36:51.861 --> 00:36:54.021]  brawl with Antifa.
[00:36:54.021 --> 00:37:08.125]  Gavin was there speaking, Antifa came to shut it down, we've seen all the footage, Antifa attacks them, but for the crime of fighting back against the meth-heads, well, they've been convicted, they've been railroaded, and we'll show some of the footage that night of the Proud Boys being attacked first.
[00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:17.647]  You saw the Proud Boys carry out a very peaceful operation in Portland, led by Joe Biggs and others, but the media tried to ignore that, but AP got it right, they said that the Proud Boys were
[00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:20.257]  I don't have any time to talk to you.
[00:37:20.257 --> 00:37:20.937]  I'm stunned.
[00:37:20.937 --> 00:37:21.958]  You won't believe these charges.
[00:37:21.958 --> 00:37:22.839]  Felony, gang assault,
[00:37:45.618 --> 00:37:49.081]  Attempted assault, which is a term I'd never heard before.
[00:37:49.081 --> 00:37:57.047]  One of the people that Max has the attempted assault charge on, his only contact was the guy kicking Max.
[00:37:57.047 --> 00:38:03.772]  So, to be beaten by someone is now you attempting to assault them.
[00:38:03.772 --> 00:38:06.694]  And these guys got three felonies each.
[00:38:06.694 --> 00:38:09.056]  They're facing 15 years in prison.
[00:38:09.056 --> 00:38:11.677]  Meanwhile, that same day, Antifa
[00:38:12.864 --> 00:38:13.424]  I think so.
[00:38:28.067 --> 00:38:30.368]  After who were arresting them, right?
[00:38:30.368 --> 00:38:33.630]  They went to court, Paul Williams, the victim said, that's the guy.
[00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:35.871]  Maybe it was Paul Miller, I forget his name.
[00:38:35.871 --> 00:38:37.011]  But those are the guys.
[00:38:37.011 --> 00:38:41.253]  They got away with misdemeanors, no criminal record, no media attention.
[00:38:41.253 --> 00:38:44.195]  You can't find any of these antifa online.
[00:38:44.195 --> 00:38:45.875]  They've been scrubbed from the internet.
[00:38:45.875 --> 00:38:55.420]  Meanwhile, the guys who are just walking home, in that footage you see them, they're on their way home, police escort, they get ambushed, they fight back, and the DA says, well,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.921]  They fought back with too much enthusiasm.
[00:38:58.921 --> 00:39:01.322]  So, they're facing 15 years in prison.
[00:39:01.322 --> 00:39:04.164]  Guilty!
[00:39:04.164 --> 00:39:06.265]  Well, Trump's gonna need to pardon these guys.
[00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:08.646]  I've never seen such a miscarriage of justice.
[00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:10.587]  I've watched all the footage, all of it's on tape.
[00:39:10.587 --> 00:39:15.789]  They get followed, they get attacked, and for fighting back, now they're gonna go to prison.
[00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:17.229]  One of them's already in Rikers.
[00:39:17.229 --> 00:39:22.272]  Jeff, uh, my buddy Jeff is, um, I forget his last name.
[00:39:22.272 --> 00:39:23.912]  Uh, he's in Rikers right now.
[00:39:23.912 --> 00:39:24.933]  He's doing weekends.
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:31.003]  And he said to me that the other prisoners there at Rikers go, what the hell are you doing here?
[00:39:31.003 --> 00:39:35.925]  And the corrections officers are getting to know the story and they go, what were you supposed to do?
[00:39:35.925 --> 00:39:47.711]  Tell me what you do when you said that Antifa draws a line in the sand, throws a bottle of urine at you after days and days of terror and says, we are not civil.
[00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:49.072]  We are going to destroy you.
[00:39:49.773 --> 00:39:50.953]  And then they get ambushed.
[00:39:50.953 --> 00:39:52.434]  Should they just sit there and take the beating?
[00:39:52.434 --> 00:39:54.775]  Because that's what the court said yesterday.
[00:39:54.775 --> 00:39:56.735]  Take a beating.
[00:39:56.735 --> 00:40:02.937]  And again, we're showing footage from every angle of the cowardly meth-head scum attacking.
[00:40:02.937 --> 00:40:06.878]  And they didn't even show up, obviously, because they know they don't want their identities blown.
[00:40:06.878 --> 00:40:12.400]  So for fighting back against masked men, they now are facing 15 years in jail.
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.020]  This is incredible.
[00:40:13.874 --> 00:40:15.675]  It's an irrelevant fight, too.
[00:40:15.675 --> 00:40:21.259]  This is a silly... If it was a brawl in hockey, it wouldn't even register with the fan.
[00:40:21.259 --> 00:40:24.642]  This was just a high school fight, like you've seen a million times.
[00:40:24.642 --> 00:40:26.123]  It was a little short skirmish.
[00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:29.005]  I mean, nobody got their ass handed to them.
[00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:31.307]  It was like 17 seconds long.
[00:40:31.307 --> 00:40:32.868]  There was no major injuries.
[00:40:32.868 --> 00:40:34.689]  There was no blood anywhere.
[00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:38.972]  It was just some guys jumped, a bunch of blue-collar dudes who know how to fight.
[00:40:38.972 --> 00:40:41.314]  The blue-collar guys got fought back.
[00:40:41.314 --> 00:40:42.875]  The so-called victim said,
[00:40:43.548 --> 00:40:43.908]  F.U.
[00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:45.129]  pig to the cops.
[00:40:45.129 --> 00:40:47.571]  Cops said, all right, I guess you don't need my help.
[00:40:47.571 --> 00:40:48.792]  And everyone went home.
[00:40:48.792 --> 00:40:58.399]  It was only the next day after de Blasio and Cuomo and the Attorney General started politicizing it, then it became, oh, this is more of Trump's hate.
[00:40:58.399 --> 00:41:01.221]  And they realized they could use that to leverage the midterm.
[00:41:01.221 --> 00:41:08.787]  And so they didn't need that idea that, oh, this brown shirt paramilitary Nazi force, part of the epidemic of non-existent white supremism that they're trying to gen up.
[00:41:08.787 --> 00:41:10.468]  This is another way to have those optics.
[00:41:11.713 --> 00:41:12.793]  Exactly.
[00:41:12.793 --> 00:41:24.216]  The narrative is that these proud boys are roaming the streets like gorillas, just looking for someone to pound, looking for some Muslims or some visible minorities to beat or some trans people.
[00:41:24.216 --> 00:41:25.596]  And that's completely fictional.
[00:41:25.596 --> 00:41:29.997]  And the truth is you were there, the truth is you were literally there just having a speaking engagement.
[00:41:29.997 --> 00:41:30.937]  They tried to shut down.
[00:41:30.937 --> 00:41:35.738]  I did a funny comedy set where I was lampooning a
[00:41:36.528 --> 00:41:36.628]  It's
[00:41:57.988 --> 00:41:59.689]  Terrorizing all the followers.
[00:41:59.689 --> 00:42:12.537]  You know, if these Proud Boys were gay, and it was all about these gay guys who were being terrorized for days, and then- It would have been a national hate movement comes and assaults and does- and death threats these people.
[00:42:12.537 --> 00:42:18.361]  It would be- if the Proud Boys were gay, then they would be on t-shirts right now, and people would be going, finally!
[00:42:18.361 --> 00:42:21.143]  We're fighting back against the homophobes!
[00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:28.723]  But because they're patriots, because they're pro-Trump, then all the media lies become real in a court of law.
[00:42:28.723 --> 00:42:30.706]  You know one thing they said in court?
[00:42:30.706 --> 00:42:33.511]  They said, I called Obama a monkey.
[00:42:33.511 --> 00:42:34.694]  A total fabrication!
[00:42:36.221 --> 00:42:38.504]  Oh, that happened in my custody battle that I ended up winning.
[00:42:38.504 --> 00:42:41.788]  They just showed some random thing on Twitter about David Duke.
[00:42:41.788 --> 00:42:42.829]  I wasn't even involved.
[00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:48.176]  I was five tweets down, somebody else tweet, and the jury just looked at me and just, it was over.
[00:42:48.176 --> 00:42:49.998]  But the judge knew it was all BS.
[00:42:49.998 --> 00:42:50.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:51.560]  Stay right there.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.382]  Gavin McGinnis, one more segment.

[00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:11.723]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[00:45:11.723 --> 00:45:14.626]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[00:45:14.626 --> 00:45:16.388]  farming goods a week ago.
[00:45:16.388 --> 00:45:20.051]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[00:45:20.672 --> 00:45:24.613]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[00:45:24.613 --> 00:45:26.274]  That's beautiful.
[00:45:26.274 --> 00:45:28.175]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[00:45:28.175 --> 00:45:29.775]  And we aren't going to back down.
[00:45:29.775 --> 00:45:37.378]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[00:45:37.378 --> 00:45:39.679]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[00:45:39.679 --> 00:45:43.860]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWorks.com.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:44.781]  And I'm asking listeners,
[00:45:45.581 --> 00:45:49.702]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[00:45:49.702 --> 00:45:50.802]  We are the resistance.
[00:45:50.802 --> 00:46:01.464]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[00:46:01.464 --> 00:46:04.904]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[00:46:04.904 --> 00:46:08.945]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:08.945 --> 00:46:13.026]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:13.026 --> 00:46:14.726]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[00:46:17.659 --> 00:46:20.782]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[00:46:20.782 --> 00:46:22.804]  It's a form of fascism.
[00:46:22.804 --> 00:46:26.547]  The high court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[00:46:26.547 --> 00:46:37.878]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:46:37.878 --> 00:46:41.321]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Gabbo is at fault.
[00:46:49.454 --> 00:46:53.439]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:46:53.439 --> 00:46:54.801]  You can't watch this!
[00:46:54.801 --> 00:47:04.454]  The movie available now at infowarsstore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:21.411 --> 00:47:22.272]  From 11 a.m.
[00:47:22.272 --> 00:47:22.892]  to 3 p.m.
[00:47:22.892 --> 00:47:23.913]  Central, I'm here live.
[00:47:23.913 --> 00:47:27.535]  David Knight's on right before me in the morning for the David Knight Show.
[00:47:27.535 --> 00:47:34.620]  Doing a great job, and of course, Owen Troyer and the War Room, Will Johnson's here visiting, sitting in for him, doing an excellent job as well.
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.702]  I tried to take a bunch of calls yesterday.
[00:47:37.702 --> 00:47:38.322]  I didn't.
[00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:39.483]  I took some.
[00:47:39.483 --> 00:47:47.368]  I didn't open the phones up with all this other news and whatever you want to cover and talk about in the next hour, into the third and fourth hour.
[00:47:47.368 --> 00:47:47.969]  Joey Gibson.
[00:47:49.133 --> 00:47:50.894]  The Patriot Pair Breakfast was there in Portland.
[00:47:50.894 --> 00:47:56.739]  He's going to pop in and give us a report on that and respond to this because this is a real miscarriage of justice.
[00:47:56.739 --> 00:47:59.260]  I've followed the buildup, the charges.
[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:05.725]  I went and watched dozens of videos because people are coming out of the club after the event.
[00:48:05.725 --> 00:48:11.469]  So there's all these angles of them being followed down the street as soon as the police break off in their protective detail.
[00:48:12.532 --> 00:48:15.973]  A mob of people attack with clubs and bottles.
[00:48:15.973 --> 00:48:32.578]  And they get their ass kicked because, again, they're meth-head professors, they are acid-head devil worshippers, they are government employees, the bad ones, and they are also members of the media.
[00:48:32.578 --> 00:48:34.278]  And they come out and wear masks.
[00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:35.778]  And they want to get their bones.
[00:48:35.778 --> 00:48:37.079]  They want to get some blood.
[00:48:39.755 --> 00:48:41.975]  Go out there and become real men fighting Nazis.
[00:48:41.975 --> 00:48:43.636]  In fact, I never got to it yesterday.
[00:48:43.636 --> 00:48:51.637]  Maybe we can pull it up, but the headline was, Democrat fundraiser forced to apologize for simulating Trump's murder.
[00:48:51.637 --> 00:49:04.260]  And it was a bunch of full-grown men, dressed up in superhero outfits like they were the Avengers, taking on Trump and simulating killing him.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:08.301]  And when I was in San Diego, I had some lepers walk by my table, bow up and think about saying something.
[00:49:08.301 --> 00:49:09.381]  He was like a 60-year-old man.
[00:49:10.805 --> 00:49:16.809]  Wearing a Deadpool shirt, saying, with an arrow to himself saying, I've got issues.
[00:49:16.809 --> 00:49:22.433]  Hey dude, because you're wearing a Deadpool shirt doesn't mean you're the fictional character.
[00:49:22.433 --> 00:49:25.115]  And all you're going to get is your neck broken if you put your hands on me.
[00:49:25.115 --> 00:49:27.216]  But these people live in fantasy land.
[00:49:27.216 --> 00:49:34.541]  And so, they're letting you know in these jurisdictions, we're going to follow you, we're going to attack you, and then our jurisdiction is going to put you in prison.
[00:49:35.745 --> 00:49:45.481]  When groups that say they want to kill the police and have attacked ICE facilities and the Dayton shooter, all of it, the guy in Texas, Antifa, they changed all his pages.
[00:49:45.481 --> 00:49:47.384]  They got that hoax over on us!
[00:49:48.737 --> 00:49:52.179]  So, Gavin McGinnis joins us, uh, hosting his own program.
[00:49:52.179 --> 00:49:54.401]  He's been banned everywhere like us, except on his own platform.
[00:49:54.401 --> 00:49:55.622]  We'll tell you how to go there in a moment.
[00:49:55.622 --> 00:49:57.904]  Because remember, the internet's still alive, it's still here.
[00:49:57.904 --> 00:50:00.866]  We have to decentralize it, as Drudge has warned.
[00:50:00.866 --> 00:50:02.267]  And it's starting to happen.
[00:50:02.267 --> 00:50:16.577]  Uh, but, a lot of my crews are really upset, they're really threatened by this, because to see the injustice, to see people hounded, and bullied, and attacked, and then convicted by this servile jury, it really shows you in these leftist jurisdictions, you cannot get justice.
[00:50:19.707 --> 00:50:22.750]  So where's it going, Gavin?
[00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.612]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:50:25.612 --> 00:50:28.554]  It's the opposite is always true.
[00:50:28.554 --> 00:50:29.075]  You know what I mean?
[00:50:29.075 --> 00:50:31.877]  Like they say, we're anti-fascists, right?
[00:50:31.877 --> 00:50:33.659]  And we're against the government.
[00:50:33.659 --> 00:50:38.543]  And we're going to go fight these fascists because they're Nazis, because they're full of hate.
[00:50:38.543 --> 00:50:40.524]  And you go, OK, that sounds good to me.
[00:50:40.524 --> 00:50:41.425]  Fight some Nazis.
[00:50:41.425 --> 00:50:42.526]  That sounds great.
[00:50:42.526 --> 00:50:43.467]  But what really happened?
[00:50:43.942 --> 00:50:47.685]  The Antifa is the paramilitary wing of the DNC.
[00:50:47.685 --> 00:50:49.266]  They are the government.
[00:50:49.266 --> 00:50:50.847]  They are the establishment.
[00:50:51.468 --> 00:50:59.393]  And they say, OK, go attack these Trump supporters, call them Nazis or whatever you have to do, and we'll let you get away with it scot-free.
[00:50:59.393 --> 00:51:00.694]  So they assault everyone.
[00:51:00.694 --> 00:51:02.456]  No problems for Antifa.
[00:51:02.456 --> 00:51:04.357]  Somehow they magically get lawyers.
[00:51:04.357 --> 00:51:08.840]  No media attention at all for the Antifa that attacked that guy.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:14.584]  And then they take this alleged Nazis, the Trump supporters, and charge them with 15 years.
[00:51:14.584 --> 00:51:16.965]  I mean, they haven't been sentenced yet, but they're facing 15 years.
[00:51:18.286 --> 00:51:21.647]  For defending themselves against a mob.
[00:51:21.647 --> 00:51:26.989]  So the fascists, the tyranny, is the left in this case.
[00:51:26.989 --> 00:51:31.630]  And the patriots, the guys supporting the president, they're the ones being treated like anarchists.
[00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.871]  They're the ones being treated like Guy Fawkes.
[00:51:33.871 --> 00:51:38.412]  And, you know, we've got this, one of the guys, John, he's got four black kids.
[00:51:38.412 --> 00:51:40.133]  His wife's black.
[00:51:40.133 --> 00:51:41.673]  And he's going to go to jail.
[00:51:41.673 --> 00:51:45.174]  So these four black kids lose a father for 15 years.
[00:51:45.174 --> 00:51:47.175]  Basically, the only years you need a father.
[00:51:47.734 --> 00:51:50.096]  Because of a lie.
[00:51:50.096 --> 00:51:52.277]  A myth that the DNC is pushing.
[00:51:52.277 --> 00:51:56.800]  And one other thing I wanted to add in there, Alex, you're listing that they're all rich kids and professor's kids.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:58.681]  There's another group of Antifa.
[00:51:58.681 --> 00:52:02.964]  The mentally weak, the vulnerable.
[00:52:02.964 --> 00:52:07.868]  Antifa and the DNC and these globalists, they prey on weak-minded men.
[00:52:07.868 --> 00:52:11.330]  Like Finn Bar-Sloanum, his father had just committed suicide.
[00:52:11.687 --> 00:52:18.931]  Two years earlier, he was a red carpet guy, and that's not, that's a young man's game now, so he got depressed and killed himself.
[00:52:18.931 --> 00:52:24.534]  They see Finbar, they see him, you know, fatherless and weak, and they go, come on into our family.
[00:52:24.534 --> 00:52:29.077]  All you'll have to do is commit some violence, and you can repay the group.
[00:52:29.077 --> 00:52:31.218]  It's really some, it's like a sick cult.
[00:52:32.247 --> 00:52:41.649]  Well, what it is, is a violent street gang, like the Brownshirts, and they actually work for someone who was working for Hitler in the day of the Brownshirts.
[00:52:41.649 --> 00:52:55.991]  George Soros, I mean, you cannot make up that their main financier made his first money working for the Nazis as a bloodhound, is what they called him, a Jew that would go find hidden Jews and convince them to then set them up and send them to death camps.
[00:52:55.991 --> 00:53:00.532]  And Soros says, on 60 Minutes, the best time of his life, he said, I had happy making
[00:53:01.372 --> 00:53:04.013]  And he's not sad for what he did.
[00:53:04.013 --> 00:53:05.474]  And then, I'm the Nazi.
[00:53:05.474 --> 00:53:07.095]  It's total mental illness.
[00:53:07.095 --> 00:53:08.095]  Oh, I forgot.
[00:53:08.095 --> 00:53:18.060]  At this event with Trump, where they simulated killing Trump at this Democrat event, again, they were dressed up like Captain America battling Red Skull.
[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.080]  I've said that a hundred times.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.461]  They think they're Captain America battling Red Skull.
[00:53:21.461 --> 00:53:22.522]  These people are crazy.
[00:53:24.031 --> 00:53:27.212]  You know, they call Soros a Holocaust survivor for those years.
[00:53:27.212 --> 00:53:30.693]  The media spin with that whole story is just incredible.
[00:53:30.693 --> 00:53:31.754]  He's an atheist.
[00:53:31.754 --> 00:53:32.974]  He hates all religion.
[00:53:32.974 --> 00:53:34.295]  That includes Judaism.
[00:53:34.295 --> 00:53:35.615]  That includes Christianity.
[00:53:35.615 --> 00:53:37.316]  His father was an atheist.
[00:53:37.316 --> 00:53:39.657]  His father hated Judaism and hated Christianity.
[00:53:39.657 --> 00:53:42.958]  You're not Jewish if you hate Judaism.
[00:53:42.958 --> 00:53:45.879]  So this has nothing to do with anti-Semitism.
[00:53:45.879 --> 00:53:48.099]  This has to do with a man who worked with the Nazis.
[00:53:48.099 --> 00:53:52.221]  But I think because we're intellectually lazy, we're mentally obese these days,
[00:53:52.541 --> 00:53:53.943]  And again, you're a really nice guy.
[00:53:53.943 --> 00:53:54.343]  You're a famous
[00:54:13.871 --> 00:54:17.874]  Kind of culture guy, famous, I'd call you kind of classical liberal or libertarian.
[00:54:17.874 --> 00:54:24.918]  That's what the left really wants you banned is because you've been so popular and launched a lot of movements, launched vice, done a lot of other things.
[00:54:24.918 --> 00:54:26.379]  But they love just projecting this lie.
[00:54:26.379 --> 00:54:28.521]  So you come on my show and you go, we're not Nazis.
[00:54:28.521 --> 00:54:30.202]  We're just into being proud of America.
[00:54:30.202 --> 00:54:36.907]  And of course, my audience knows that, Gavin McInnes, but the larger issue is they're not going to stop.
[00:54:36.907 --> 00:54:40.309]  The New York Times has announced, well it leaked, that they're going to basically
[00:54:40.789 --> 00:54:41.329]  We just keep fighting.
[00:55:03.223 --> 00:55:04.625]  You know, we've been through worse.
[00:55:04.625 --> 00:55:06.387]  We've been through the Civil War.
[00:55:06.387 --> 00:55:08.390]  We've been through the American Revolution.
[00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:12.575]  We've been through Vietnam, totally polarized America.
[00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:13.977]  And we fought through that.
[00:55:13.977 --> 00:55:17.281]  And truth, you know, the pendulum swings both ways.
[00:55:17.281 --> 00:55:18.903]  And I think truth is on its way back.
[00:55:18.903 --> 00:55:20.185]  These propagandists
[00:55:20.578 --> 00:55:21.739]  Have no plan.
[00:55:21.739 --> 00:55:25.681]  They say no border, no wall, no USA at all.
[00:55:25.681 --> 00:55:31.825]  And I even heard a chant the other day that said, from Palestine to Mexico, all the walls have got to go.
[00:55:31.825 --> 00:55:35.487]  So they don't want any borders at all in the entire world.
[00:55:35.487 --> 00:55:42.252]  An idea like that, much like fascism, by the way, can't gain any serious traction.
[00:55:42.252 --> 00:55:47.595]  The Nazis couldn't have lasted, and these people won't last, because tyrannical
[00:55:49.361 --> 00:55:52.364]  Orthodoxy, tyranny doesn't last.
[00:55:52.364 --> 00:55:53.645]  Freedom lasts.
[00:55:53.645 --> 00:55:54.846]  That's right.
[00:55:54.846 --> 00:55:57.428]  Gavin, where do folks find your great daily programs?
[00:55:58.697 --> 00:56:01.138]  They find me at freespeech.tv.
[00:56:01.138 --> 00:56:04.719]  I'll be announcing we're going to have to crowdfund for an appeal for these guys.
[00:56:04.719 --> 00:56:07.860]  There's still another one, by the way, but he's East Indian.
[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.180]  He's brown.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.881]  So that's not helping their narrative.
[00:56:10.881 --> 00:56:13.922]  So that one's delayed until December or something.
[00:56:13.922 --> 00:56:16.343]  But we have to fight for an appeal for these guys.
[00:56:16.343 --> 00:56:20.844]  It's just very difficult to set up a crowdfund because these Antifa wasps
[00:56:21.224 --> 00:56:23.925]  Swarm everything you do and constantly shut it down.
[00:56:23.925 --> 00:56:31.029]  So every payment system has to have ten different layers and offshore accounts and whatever just to raise money for legal representation.
[00:56:31.029 --> 00:56:31.369]  Exactly.
[00:56:31.369 --> 00:56:34.310]  I don't think the listeners and viewers out there realizes we're not whiners.
[00:56:34.310 --> 00:56:37.272]  Just how much attack we're under because we are the resistance.
[00:56:37.272 --> 00:56:38.392]  Gavin McGinnis, thank you so much.
[00:56:38.392 --> 00:56:39.793]  Talk to you soon.
[00:56:39.793 --> 00:56:40.994]  Thanks for having me.
[00:56:40.994 --> 00:56:41.734]  Great guy.
[00:56:41.734 --> 00:56:42.254]  These terrible
[00:56:44.005 --> 00:56:49.756]  Terrible things are happening around the country and around the world to persecute nationalists because we're winning and we're going to win in the end.
[00:56:49.756 --> 00:56:52.761]  But please, you heard what he was just talking about.
[00:56:52.761 --> 00:56:55.547]  I've got major lawsuits we've got to file to counter these people.
[00:56:56.599 --> 00:57:03.282]  I want to just keep operating, so I'm trying to expand in the face of the globalists going into 2020, and we're successfully reaching out to folks.
[00:57:03.282 --> 00:57:05.703]  Thanks to you spreading the word about the articles and the videos.
[00:57:05.703 --> 00:57:07.564]  Thanks to Matt Drudge linking to them.
[00:57:07.564 --> 00:57:09.144]  Thanks to folks supporting our local stations.
[00:57:09.144 --> 00:57:19.548]  But seriously, we're going to have to end this extended sale, this World Awakens sale that's almost every item at InfoWareStore.com, all the supplements, 50-60% off, and a bunch of other big deals.
[00:57:19.548 --> 00:57:21.309]  We've got to end it in a couple days.
[00:57:21.309 --> 00:57:23.290]  We've extended it, but a lot of things are about to sell out.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:27.160]  We're good to go.
[00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:51.635]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:53.875]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[00:57:53.875 --> 00:57:55.215]  This is reality.
[00:57:55.215 --> 00:57:56.176]  And I'll say this.
[00:57:56.176 --> 00:57:57.276]  It's all of our birthrights.
[00:57:57.276 --> 00:57:59.356]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight.
[00:57:59.356 --> 00:58:01.437]  We're all having our birthrights stolen right now.
[00:58:01.437 --> 00:58:02.917]  We're seeing election meddling.
[00:58:02.917 --> 00:58:06.898]  And it's time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor power grab.
[00:58:06.898 --> 00:58:09.378]  They didn't come like an enemy from over the horizon.
[00:58:09.378 --> 00:58:10.699]  They came from inside.
[00:58:10.699 --> 00:58:12.159]  And they came through cyberspace.
[00:58:12.739 --> 00:58:13.019]  I think?
[00:58:34.667 --> 00:58:37.469]  Not on every item, because a bunch of these are very close to selling out.
[00:58:37.469 --> 00:58:47.277]  Whether it's Ultimate Krill Oil, Body's Turmeric, Brain Force Plus, Knockout Sleep Aid, Turbo Force, 8-Pack Power Stack, it's all 50-60% off, and your purchases make it all possible here.
[00:58:49.728 --> 00:58:52.691]  One half of the incredible 8-pack Power Stack, the A.M.
[00:58:52.691 --> 00:58:56.335]  Wake Up and Work Packet is exactly what you need to start your day right.
[00:58:56.335 --> 00:59:06.185]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's individual needs in the morning, targeting the heart, brain, muscles, energy production and more.
[00:59:06.185 --> 00:59:06.765]  Each A.M.
[00:59:06.765 --> 00:59:13.132]  pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kickstart, krill oil, nootropic brain and greens detox formula.
[00:59:13.932 --> 00:59:14.733]  With the P.M.
[00:59:14.733 --> 00:59:19.437]  Pack and the A-Pack Power Stack, you can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[00:59:19.437 --> 00:59:22.059]  Containing four original formulas, the P.M.
[00:59:22.059 --> 00:59:28.504]  Rest and Recover Pack will build up your body's defenses and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[00:59:28.504 --> 00:59:33.388]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep, and immune support formulas, the P.M.
[00:59:33.388 --> 00:59:37.411]  Packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system.
[00:59:37.571 --> 00:59:38.912]  Okay, here's what's gonna happen.
[01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:08.277]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:08.277 --> 01:00:10.277]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:10.277 --> 01:00:17.499]  We're going to wage war on corruption and I'm going to take a bunch of your calls bam bam bam this hour so folks don't have to hold an hour.
[01:00:17.499 --> 01:00:25.561]  So this hour and the next we're going to take calls on the fluoride and the big studies admitting it lowers IQs particularly in males.
[01:00:25.561 --> 01:00:27.402]  Causes cancer.
[01:00:27.402 --> 01:00:31.983]  Also the runoffs causing horny confused cane toads to rape pythons.
[01:00:31.983 --> 01:00:32.563]  Gang rape them.
[01:00:33.445 --> 01:00:34.365]  I'm not joking.
[01:00:34.365 --> 01:00:37.847]  We're going to show you the video of the gang raping.
[01:00:37.847 --> 01:00:39.708]  So much is coming up this hour.
[01:00:39.708 --> 01:00:41.028]  We've got Elizabeth Warren's apology.
[01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:44.450]  We've got that insane press conference last night with Tlaib.
[01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:45.370]  I want everything free!
[01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:48.111]  My mother just couldn't come to Israel and get free health care!
[01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.112]  Or my grandmother!
[01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:49.572]  Mommy!
[01:00:49.572 --> 01:00:50.072]  Mommy!
[01:00:50.072 --> 01:00:55.434]  I want to overthrow Israel and kill all the Jews, but get me free health care!
[01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:56.995]  It's over the top.
[01:00:58.089 --> 01:00:59.330]  So that's all coming up too.
[01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:04.555]  I'll give the number out next segment, but here is a report detailing a lot of this.
[01:01:04.555 --> 01:01:08.599]  A New York Times to reframe American values in order to launch a race war.
[01:01:08.599 --> 01:01:09.560]  Here it is.
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.301]  Help us understand the genesis of this.
[01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:12.743]  How long you've been thinking about this.
[01:01:12.743 --> 01:01:16.947]  How long you've been thinking about changing our notions of the start of this country.
[01:01:16.947 --> 01:01:17.527]  Moving it from 1776 to 1619.
[01:01:20.615 --> 01:01:25.618]  So I first came across the year, the date, 1619, as a high school student.
[01:01:25.618 --> 01:01:29.361]  And I came across it in a book called Before the Mayflower.
[01:01:29.361 --> 01:01:39.507]  And I just remembered as a student being astounded because I had never thought that enslaved people, that people of African descent had been here even before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.
[01:01:39.507 --> 01:01:43.030]  So I've been obsessed with that period for a long time.
[01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:44.951]  And as the anniversary was approaching,
[01:01:45.171 --> 01:02:02.467]  I really thought that this was an opportunity to finally examine, in an institution like the Times, the legacy of what it means to be a country that was founded in slavery and where, you know, this is the 400th anniversary of... The whole world had slavery then!
[01:02:03.308 --> 01:02:08.871]  We look at the New York Times, we look at all CNN, MSNBC, and they're just up there.
[01:02:08.871 --> 01:02:13.593]  This is a white supremacist when he lowered flags because of the shooting in El Paso.
[01:02:13.593 --> 01:02:15.354]  It was the Heil Hitler.
[01:02:15.354 --> 01:02:17.055]  And you're just like, this doesn't make sense.
[01:02:17.055 --> 01:02:20.496]  It's targeting the dumbest people in the country.
[01:02:20.496 --> 01:02:30.841]  And it's also creating hysteria where people think that if they don't jump on board with whatever the Democrats say, they're going to be called racist.
[01:02:30.841 --> 01:02:32.382]  That's the new religion.
[01:02:33.769 --> 01:02:38.830]  That's the system of bullying that these people are inducting everyone into.
[01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:55.395]  When someone is dividing the country with racist rhetoric and saying things that are causing people to literally anger up and get into fights and act crazy, and he's giving people a license to hate, you gotta call it out.
[01:02:55.395 --> 01:02:57.116]  Otherwise, what are you doing here?
[01:02:57.116 --> 01:03:00.697]  I think there are a lot of people in
[01:03:02.228 --> 01:03:10.699]  The Republican base and Trump's base and Fox News's base that have a visceral reaction to the color of my skin.
[01:03:10.699 --> 01:03:15.386]  You don't get to say I'm for racial equality and all these good things.
[01:03:15.386 --> 01:03:16.988]  I disagree with them there, but...
[01:03:17.468 --> 01:03:18.869]  I like his economic views.
[01:03:18.869 --> 01:03:19.649]  I'm going to vote for him.
[01:03:19.649 --> 01:03:20.530]  No, you own it.
[01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.472]  You own the blood that happens.
[01:03:23.472 --> 01:03:26.593]  It used to be, well, we're against illegal immigration, but we're for illegal immigration.
[01:03:26.593 --> 01:03:28.454]  That was the party's historical stance.
[01:03:28.454 --> 01:03:33.017]  Now, it looks increasingly like, under Donald Trump, the Republican Party is hostile towards all immigrants.
[01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:44.143]  If you are supporting a president that is caging brown babies, and you are okay with that, then I'm sorry, that is supporting racist policies.
[01:03:44.143 --> 01:03:47.946]  And that is not distinct from supporting a racist president.
[01:03:47.946 --> 01:03:59.653]  Trump came out and lashed out at the New York Times, claiming it's going on a racism witch hunt now that the Russiagate has failed.
[01:03:59.653 --> 01:04:00.494]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:01.656 --> 01:04:03.837]  That's not what he claims.
[01:04:03.837 --> 01:04:06.938]  That's what they say.
[01:04:06.938 --> 01:04:10.399]  But Slate Magazine is who got it.
[01:04:10.399 --> 01:04:15.120]  And you read the transcript, it is unbelievable.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:21.582]  The head of the New York Times says to the employees, look, Russia didn't work.
[01:04:21.582 --> 01:04:22.642]  He came up flat-footed.
[01:04:22.642 --> 01:04:24.063]  These are quotes.
[01:04:24.063 --> 01:04:28.184]  We're pivoting to race to remove him from office.
[01:04:29.801 --> 01:04:31.622]  They're the ones bringing up race.
[01:04:31.622 --> 01:04:32.603]  They're the ones lying.
[01:04:32.603 --> 01:04:33.763]  They're the ones dividing.
[01:04:33.763 --> 01:04:36.585]  They're the ones doing all of this.
[01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:46.611]  And then they've got the nerve to act like it's Trump when he's done nothing but prison reform to get black people out of jail and tried to bring factories to the inner city.
[01:04:46.611 --> 01:04:48.592]  But it's beyond a racism witch hunt.
[01:04:48.592 --> 01:04:52.655]  They're trying to invoke a civil war.
[01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:54.416]  Stay with us, critical intel straight ahead.
[01:04:57.222 --> 01:04:57.462]  Oh, thanks.
[01:05:28.163 --> 01:05:29.723]  Let me break this down for you.
[01:05:29.723 --> 01:05:31.224]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[01:05:31.224 --> 01:05:32.265]  I want a good price.
[01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:36.367]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:38.628]  I'm making $2 on my toothpaste 50% off.
[01:05:38.628 --> 01:05:42.230]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:43.191]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[01:05:43.191 --> 01:05:47.393]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[01:05:47.393 --> 01:05:52.036]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we're doing 50% off.
[01:05:52.036 --> 01:05:55.077]  And then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[01:05:55.077 --> 01:05:55.718]  But that's okay.
[01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:56.338]  Thanks for the support.
[01:06:23.098 --> 01:06:28.080]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:07:01.286 --> 01:07:05.449]  As I sit here on this live Tuesday, August 20th, 2019, global transmission, I have the 1974 blueprint.
[01:07:05.449 --> 01:07:07.810]  A PhD and above.
[01:07:14.969 --> 01:07:25.953]  battle plan that was adopted on a planetary scale by the forces of the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:07:25.953 --> 01:07:28.094]  Now, that's the corporate designation.
[01:07:28.094 --> 01:07:35.516]  It has nothing to do with white people in the main, but it is a racist, anti-human project.
[01:07:35.516 --> 01:07:36.857]  And so, when you read
[01:07:38.536 --> 01:08:06.430]  A book written by the later White House science czar of Barack Hussein Obama, John P. Holdren, with Paul Ehrlich and Annie Ehrlich, and you read about all their statements about forcibly depopulating the world, and how compounds like fluoride should be used to reduce fertility, that's sterilize, statistically, in the main, reduce fertility, reduce yields,
[01:08:08.154 --> 01:08:10.375]  And then what else?
[01:08:10.375 --> 01:08:17.660]  Lower IQ and increase morbidity.
[01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:23.403]  You know, when you have rictimortis, when you're bye-bye.
[01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:26.385]  We're going to get to this in just a moment.
[01:08:26.385 --> 01:08:33.729]  What you see on screen of your radio listener, you probably want to go in and read the toothpaste in your house if you're a new listener.
[01:08:33.729 --> 01:08:37.552]  And it's got a warning saying if you ingest more than a pea-sized amount of this,
[01:08:39.537 --> 01:08:45.461]  Call poison control immediately.
[01:08:45.461 --> 01:08:48.803]  These things must be done delicately, my little friend.
[01:08:48.803 --> 01:08:55.087]  And I'll get you, and your little kids, too!
[01:08:55.087 --> 01:09:00.610]  So, the eugenicists call the general public bad sons.
[01:09:00.610 --> 01:09:02.791]  Bad sons have got a crepe myrtle or an oak tree.
[01:09:02.791 --> 01:09:06.454]  Actually, the tree itself's roots throw up more.
[01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:09.290]  But maybe you don't want a bunch of trees.
[01:09:09.290 --> 01:09:11.652]  I think you just want to have pretty trees.
[01:09:11.652 --> 01:09:13.734]  Well, you go pull out the bad sons.
[01:09:13.734 --> 01:09:17.856]  So real eugenics isn't trying to improve the race.
[01:09:17.856 --> 01:09:23.641]  That's a parlor or porch or outer room.
[01:09:24.622 --> 01:09:27.925]  To recruit the low-level dumbbells to support it.
[01:09:27.925 --> 01:09:31.047]  Oh, our movement's to help people!
[01:09:31.047 --> 01:09:36.952]  And all it is is a science project of the Illuminati, which is a real organization, a real group.
[01:09:36.952 --> 01:09:41.455]  Check your encyclopedia, you'll probably go, oh wow, type in George Washington letters on the Illuminati.
[01:09:41.455 --> 01:09:43.737]  Now he was battling it.
[01:09:43.737 --> 01:09:49.601]  Oh, you didn't know he wrote like dozens of letters on the Illuminati and Luciferian organizations?
[01:09:49.601 --> 01:09:51.082]  That his Masonic Order was battling?
[01:09:52.150 --> 01:10:03.373]  It's not true that all the masons serve Lucifer, but a movement that's taken over masonry, in many respects, when you become 33rd degree, you learn all the secrets of Lucifer.
[01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:11.536]  And I've made no secret of the fact that my family's founding members of Texas, and some of them were 33rd degree, but they were Christians.
[01:10:11.536 --> 01:10:15.017]  And those are not the secrets you learn from those orders.
[01:10:15.017 --> 01:10:16.597]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:10:16.597 --> 01:10:18.998]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:42.436]  Here we are, with everybody calling me and just freaking out, going, oh my gosh, the Journal of American Medicine and Harvard, they all just came out, and they said, take the floor out of the water, it's causing massive brain damage, massive infertility, just, it's devastating black people.
[01:10:42.436 --> 01:10:47.637]  And yes, we're all different, we're all similar, but we're all different.
[01:10:47.637 --> 01:10:50.738]  And males have blood-brain barriers,
[01:10:52.344 --> 01:10:54.345]  Up to 70% weaker than women's.
[01:10:54.345 --> 01:10:55.786]  On general, it's about half.
[01:10:55.786 --> 01:10:57.508]  I've got all the studies, I'll show them to you right here.
[01:10:57.508 --> 01:11:00.950]  And women have much stronger blood brain barriers.
[01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:02.831]  Because of what chemically goes on in their body.
[01:11:02.831 --> 01:11:03.832]  Men and women are different.
[01:11:03.832 --> 01:11:08.255]  But black males, just type in blacks and fluoride.
[01:11:08.255 --> 01:11:12.018]  Blacks suffer most from fluoride.
[01:11:12.018 --> 01:11:16.501]  And that's the new American with a big link to studies.
[01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:18.723]  But let me explain something.
[01:11:18.723 --> 01:11:21.825]  That's at 1.3 parts per million.
[01:11:22.756 --> 01:11:24.637]  Little over one part per million.
[01:11:24.637 --> 01:11:44.830]  If you ingest the powdered eggs they were serving until the 60s in federal prisons and on chain gangs, they were up to 600 parts per million being fed to prisoners.
[01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:46.271]  Might want to learn about that.
[01:11:46.271 --> 01:11:51.835]  Now, at that level, ladies and gentlemen, you're talking shutdown of the brain, fertility's fried,
[01:11:53.427 --> 01:11:58.069]  You might as well dip your testicles into acid.
[01:11:58.069 --> 01:12:00.671]  Might as well blow your head off at that point.
[01:12:00.671 --> 01:12:14.737]  Now, if you look at what's in Crest for children, all of these, it's not even listed what parts per million because the fluoride is in the parts per hundred.
[01:12:14.737 --> 01:12:17.919]  It's so high that one of the main ingredients is fluoride.
[01:12:19.028 --> 01:12:23.109]  Hydrofluorosilic and it all tastes like candy for children.
[01:12:23.109 --> 01:12:25.950]  You've got Mickey Mouse on the front.
[01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:26.850]  That's what your kid's into.
[01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:33.952]  Oh, be a little mermaid who drools and is so stupid and has her whole future taken away from her.
[01:12:33.952 --> 01:12:36.712]  It's all meant so your kids eat it.
[01:12:36.712 --> 01:12:39.593]  Oh, and maybe your son's into velociraptors.
[01:12:39.593 --> 01:12:41.233]  They think those are cute.
[01:12:41.233 --> 01:12:46.955]  And all these R's like the VC would put like a cool doll or a cool ring or a cool samurai sword.
[01:12:48.308 --> 01:12:52.472]  The Japanese did this in Island Warfare as well, and you know, somebody that wasn't listening goes, oh, that's a cool-looking sword!
[01:12:52.472 --> 01:13:00.018]  You pull it, well, the kid sees it and is like, oh, mom, I want the, the, this has got Mickey Mouse on it!
[01:13:00.018 --> 01:13:01.780]  Oh, look, mommy!
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:02.741]  Fluoride act!
[01:13:04.933 --> 01:13:07.576]  Oh, fluoride, oh, it's all so good.
[01:13:07.576 --> 01:13:09.498]  Oh, smart rinse.
[01:13:09.498 --> 01:13:10.179]  That's a big joke.
[01:13:10.179 --> 01:13:13.543]  You're going to be real smart once we rinse your brain with this.
[01:13:13.543 --> 01:13:18.288]  So at 1.3 parts per million, I'm going to show you mainstream studies right now that everybody's freaking out over.
[01:13:18.288 --> 01:13:21.692]  They're exactly what all the other studies showed 100 years ago.
[01:13:21.692 --> 01:13:24.615]  Say it again, the Nazis used it in death camps.
[01:13:27.349 --> 01:13:29.050]  That's in Pulitzer Prize winning books.
[01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:30.070]  But hell, why listen to that?
[01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:36.513]  I've got the science czar saying increase it in our water to lower our IQs and dumb us down.
[01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:36.994]  Look it up.
[01:13:36.994 --> 01:13:38.014]  Ecoscience.
[01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:40.155]  Call for sterilization agents in water.
[01:13:40.155 --> 01:13:43.497]  Fluoride's the chief.
[01:13:43.497 --> 01:13:44.257]  Might want to read it.
[01:13:44.257 --> 01:13:50.400]  You know, it's the owner's manual to screw up your life and make sure you're not a player in the future by dumbing you down.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:53.722]  They don't want you making decisions.
[01:13:53.722 --> 01:13:53.862]  Now,
[01:13:55.834 --> 01:13:58.835]  We know the education system is designed to dumb you down.
[01:13:58.835 --> 01:14:00.756]  It's social control.
[01:14:00.756 --> 01:14:04.517]  So here's the studies, but let me hit some of these first.
[01:14:04.517 --> 01:14:04.658]  U.S.
[01:14:04.658 --> 01:14:06.998]  military pondered love not war.
[01:14:06.998 --> 01:14:15.842]  BBC spraying chemicals on men to make them be attracted to the opposite sex.
[01:14:15.842 --> 01:14:17.563]  No, that's not what the headline is.
[01:14:17.563 --> 01:14:20.024]  I'm having a Freudian slip.
[01:14:20.024 --> 01:14:20.724]  To the same sex.
[01:14:22.346 --> 01:14:23.708]  Now think about that.
[01:14:23.708 --> 01:14:24.289]  How do you do that?
[01:14:24.289 --> 01:14:26.872]  Well a lot of the sex is off olfactory nerves.
[01:14:26.872 --> 01:14:31.338]  It's off smell and other things that go on.
[01:14:31.338 --> 01:14:31.899]  Now let's continue.
[01:14:31.899 --> 01:14:32.620]  That's BBC.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:33.261]  Doesn't exist though.
[01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:34.442]  They say Jones is crazy.
[01:14:34.442 --> 01:14:35.884]  Says it was a gay bong.
[01:14:35.884 --> 01:14:36.045]  U.S.
[01:14:36.045 --> 01:14:38.608]  military once proposed gay bong.
[01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:39.009]  Is moto.
[01:14:41.572 --> 01:14:48.679]  So, when we come back, I'll give the number out to open the phones up, but I wanted to show Forbes saying I'm a big liar, it's all good for you.
[01:14:48.679 --> 01:15:00.330]  And the new studies, here's Reuters, study prompts call for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women, saying it lowers IQ, particularly in boys.
[01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:02.792]  Well, who needs that IQ?
[01:15:02.792 --> 01:15:04.915]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[01:15:06.075 --> 01:15:08.755]  From JAMA, the most prestigious one.
[01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:12.896]  Study links fluoride in water during pregnancy, and it's conclusive.
[01:15:12.896 --> 01:15:18.137]  But then I've got the Mexican studies, the Chinese studies.
[01:15:18.137 --> 01:15:21.258]  I've got the frogs from the Atrazine now raping snakes.
[01:15:21.258 --> 01:15:22.238]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[01:15:22.238 --> 01:15:24.098]  I'm not joking.
[01:15:24.098 --> 01:15:26.178]  Truth, strange, and fiction.
[01:15:26.178 --> 01:15:30.019]  But I wanted to show you when they say, oh, well, the babies need it for their teeth.
[01:15:30.019 --> 01:15:34.360]  No, actually, ingesting fluoride of just the regular types tossing it up.
[01:15:35.376 --> 01:15:38.099]  Calcium chloride, hydrofluorosilicic weaponized.
[01:15:38.099 --> 01:15:39.720]  It's charged up acid.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.862]  It bounces around the nerves better.
[01:15:41.862 --> 01:15:43.183]  You know, acid eats through things.
[01:15:43.183 --> 01:15:44.725]  It just eats, eats, eats, eats.
[01:15:44.725 --> 01:15:49.629]  The elite just watch your eyes dim and they sit back.
[01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:50.810]  Hardcore evil.
[01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:52.712]  Wait till I tell you how they trick your kids to eat it.
[01:15:55.908 --> 01:16:01.672]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[01:16:14.501 --> 01:16:22.366]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:16:22.526 --> 01:16:24.327]  Not a security IPO or note.
[01:16:24.327 --> 01:16:33.850]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[01:17:25.413 --> 01:17:26.634]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:26.634 --> 01:17:30.555]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:30.555 --> 01:17:32.096]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:32.096 --> 01:17:35.058]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:35.058 --> 01:17:40.620]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:41.821]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:41.821 --> 01:17:44.762]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:44.762 --> 01:17:46.983]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:46.983 --> 01:17:51.425]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:17:51.425 --> 01:17:53.707]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:59.614 --> 01:18:03.058]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[01:18:03.058 --> 01:18:07.102]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:18:07.102 --> 01:18:08.964]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:18:08.964 --> 01:18:15.831]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:18:15.831 --> 01:18:18.995]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:20.056]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:18:21.101 --> 01:18:24.683]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:18:24.683 --> 01:18:36.011]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:18:36.011 --> 01:18:47.638]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davidoff would fall.
[01:18:47.638 --> 01:18:48.859]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:18:51.562 --> 01:18:53.567]  You can't watch this, the movie.
[01:18:53.567 --> 01:18:55.671]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:18:57.463 --> 01:19:13.351]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:19:13.351 --> 01:19:15.072]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:19:15.072 --> 01:19:25.938]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:19:26.218 --> 01:19:26.938]  I think so.
[01:19:45.808 --> 01:19:48.149]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:23.834 --> 01:20:26.415]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:26.415 --> 01:20:31.796]  We're here, live, weekdays, 11am to 3pm.
[01:20:31.796 --> 01:20:38.337]  Right before we come on, there's David Knight, live, weekday mornings, 8am to 11am.
[01:20:38.337 --> 01:20:43.878]  And then, 3pm, Owen Schroyer and the War Room.
[01:20:43.878 --> 01:20:49.759]  So, I get up here and I cover all this, and I'm really extremely angry.
[01:20:49.759 --> 01:20:52.460]  That I've been sarcastically, you know, talking about how sick this is.
[01:20:53.482 --> 01:21:02.326]  Because, just like Joe Camel admittedly targeted children with cigarettes when I was a kid, they had candy cigarettes and candy cigars to get you ready for it.
[01:21:02.326 --> 01:21:09.590]  And it turned out that the tobacco companies, early on, owned those candy companies.
[01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:18.855]  And they funded the feminist movement to tell women, you show your man, get out there and smoke cigarettes, because it was seen as kind of an uncouth thing to do for ladies.
[01:21:20.282 --> 01:21:25.787]  But boy, those women, up until even the 80s and 90s, have still said, you've sure come a long way.
[01:21:25.787 --> 01:21:28.230]  Virginia Slim ads.
[01:21:28.230 --> 01:21:29.951]  Type in Virginia Slims.
[01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:30.712]  You've come a long way.
[01:21:30.712 --> 01:21:39.020]  There's even TV ads like, you're moving up in society, you're showing those men, you'll get lung cancer like them too!
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:39.600]  And what did they do?
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:45.426]  They added hundreds and hundreds of chemicals to the cigarettes to make them more addictive and to get past the blood-brain barrier.
[01:21:49.039 --> 01:21:53.320]  There it is, you've come a long way.
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:22:13.547]  Maybe in post, when we post this to InfoWars and we're not live, we should just add the add-in with audio so people can hear it, but it was one of Bertrand Russell's good buddies, Sigmund Freud's nephew, who came up with the idea, Edward Bernays,
[01:22:14.775 --> 01:22:20.338]  To fund full-page ads telling women, march for suffrage and have freedom torches.
[01:22:20.338 --> 01:22:23.199]  Hold up your cigarettes.
[01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:29.383]  They had doctors on TV, later, saying, smoke camels, they'll help your lungs.
[01:22:29.383 --> 01:22:31.184]  I'd walk a mile for camel.
[01:22:31.184 --> 01:22:32.444]  Having a cough, sore throat?
[01:22:32.444 --> 01:22:34.786]  Smoke a camel!
[01:22:34.786 --> 01:22:35.566]  Smoke a Marlboro!
[01:22:35.566 --> 01:22:39.188]  Well, look what they did for the Marlboro man!
[01:22:40.342 --> 01:22:43.924]  And now it's, oh, Mickey Mouse!
[01:22:43.924 --> 01:22:46.405]  You'll be with Mickey in your grave.
[01:22:46.405 --> 01:22:47.685]  Your brain cells.
[01:22:47.685 --> 01:22:49.946]  And it all tastes like candy.
[01:22:49.946 --> 01:22:51.727]  And you tell the kids don't eat it.
[01:22:51.727 --> 01:22:53.508]  But they do.
[01:22:53.508 --> 01:22:57.149]  They eat the candy, and then they see the pretty colors.
[01:22:57.149 --> 01:22:58.970]  And then they don't do too well.
[01:22:58.970 --> 01:23:01.011]  But that's all right.
[01:23:01.011 --> 01:23:04.092]  It's all for the greater good of the New World Order.
[01:23:04.092 --> 01:23:07.194]  It's all done so there's not pesky people with high IQs in the way.
[01:23:08.712 --> 01:23:12.416]  Who'll actually read the textbooks they wrote like we're idiots and don't even care.
[01:23:12.416 --> 01:23:19.884]  And then we've got fluoride for babies.
[01:23:19.884 --> 01:23:24.028]  Fluoride for babies.
[01:23:24.028 --> 01:23:27.151]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:23:27.151 --> 01:23:30.875]  But I'm going to show you the studies saying, oh, don't, don't.
[01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:36.374]  Give your kids any fluoride before their teeth erupt, because the studies are conclusive.
[01:23:36.374 --> 01:23:42.398]  They go in and cause the teeth to be malformed, have dental fluorosis, and fracture and be chalky.
[01:23:42.398 --> 01:23:45.881]  That was the American Dental Association 20 years ago.
[01:23:45.881 --> 01:23:50.925]  Started hedging its bets and creeping away from fluoride.
[01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:52.567]  Let me show you those studies.
[01:23:52.567 --> 01:24:00.914]  But again, here's the Pentagon, BBC, you name it, saying, chemicals to make males not have children.
[01:24:00.914 --> 01:24:01.314]  Gay bomb.
[01:24:03.297 --> 01:24:05.518]  Oh, but don't worry.
[01:24:05.518 --> 01:24:07.778]  Forbes says I'm crazy.
[01:24:07.778 --> 01:24:12.859]  There's no studies, they say, that fluoride lowers IQ.
[01:24:12.859 --> 01:24:16.780]  They just say I made it up.
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.361]  Well, here it is.
[01:24:17.361 --> 01:24:20.861]  Study prompts call for lower fluoride consumption by pregnant women.
[01:24:20.861 --> 01:24:24.842]  Reuters, because it lowers the IQs, particularly in boys.
[01:24:24.842 --> 01:24:27.723]  Massively.
[01:24:27.723 --> 01:24:29.564]  Over the years, up to 20, 30, 40 points.
[01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:30.524]  Double bad for blacks.
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.861]  Study links fluoridated water during pregnancy to lower IQs.
[01:24:35.861 --> 01:24:38.401]  Let me show you the other ones I was going to tell you about.
[01:24:38.401 --> 01:24:42.262]  Fluoride, developmental neurotoxicity, another study.
[01:24:42.262 --> 01:24:42.362]  U.S.
[01:24:42.362 --> 01:24:44.742]  Department of Health and Human Services.
[01:24:44.742 --> 01:24:46.563]  National toxicity program.
[01:24:46.563 --> 01:24:54.644]  So they mandate to put it in and tell you, by the way, we're killing you while we do it.
[01:24:54.644 --> 01:24:57.645]  Drinking fluoridated water during pregnancy may lower IQs in sons.
[01:24:59.025 --> 01:25:06.988]  Again, runoff of atrazine causing frogs to rape and toads to rape pythons.
[01:25:06.988 --> 01:25:08.429]  Rape snakes.
[01:25:08.429 --> 01:25:10.869]  Gang rape them.
[01:25:10.869 --> 01:25:14.851]  Oh, the fluoride's not making the chemicals in the water, not making the frogs gay.
[01:25:14.851 --> 01:25:21.994]  They're just making them sterile and rapist.
[01:25:21.994 --> 01:25:25.335]  Prenatal fluoride exposure and cognitive outcomes in children.
[01:25:26.641 --> 01:25:28.443]  Mexico study shows the exact same thing.
[01:25:28.443 --> 01:25:31.347]  Massive IQ reduction.
[01:25:31.347 --> 01:25:43.261]  Infant formula says don't mix in formulas that use water that have fluoride because it'll increase the chances of fluorosis.
[01:25:43.261 --> 01:25:44.242]  But that's just a warning.
[01:25:45.609 --> 01:25:51.052]  You're never told that when you're at the end cap of the grocery store and all there is is fluoride for your baby.
[01:25:51.052 --> 01:25:54.034]  So they got screwed up teeth and screwed up brains.
[01:25:54.034 --> 01:25:54.574]  Yay!
[01:25:54.574 --> 01:25:56.215]  Thanks, New World Order!
[01:25:56.215 --> 01:26:03.899]  Well, if we can't abort them, or get their organs out when they're born, we're gonna teach your son he's really a girl and chop his balls off.
[01:26:03.899 --> 01:26:06.660]  Oh!
[01:26:06.660 --> 01:26:08.441]  And now, the Drag Queen Story Times.
[01:26:08.441 --> 01:26:11.063]  Don't just have children humping men's groins.
[01:26:12.074 --> 01:26:22.478]  Now they have books at the library teaching six-year-olds oral sex and how enjoyable it is and how, if you see a man at the park, go pull your pants down, he'll do something for you.
[01:26:22.478 --> 01:26:24.619]  Oh yeah, they're telling, go to him, get in the white van.
[01:26:24.619 --> 01:26:26.760]  Actually, go to the man.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.961]  The man comes in your backyard, climb out.
[01:26:29.961 --> 01:26:32.022]  This is in libraries.
[01:26:32.022 --> 01:26:33.622]  Four children.
[01:26:33.622 --> 01:26:35.823]  Hey kids, go to the park.
[01:26:35.823 --> 01:26:37.324]  Go to the pervert park.
[01:26:37.324 --> 01:26:38.484]  Go in the bathroom.
[01:26:38.484 --> 01:26:39.905]  He's got a prize for you.
[01:26:41.527 --> 01:26:46.951]  Hey Georgie, stick your arm down in here.
[01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:48.972]  So there you go.
[01:26:48.972 --> 01:26:53.216]  See, I just documented all that, but Forbes, what did Forbes say?
[01:26:53.216 --> 01:26:56.338]  They said the word ridiculous.
[01:26:56.338 --> 01:27:01.221]  They said Alex Jones is ridiculous.
[01:27:01.221 --> 01:27:06.786]  There's no IQ reduction, particularly in boys, exactly as I said.
[01:27:06.786 --> 01:27:07.266]  Forbes.
[01:27:09.366 --> 01:27:11.306]  What a good person.
[01:27:11.306 --> 01:27:16.068]  And you know, so many of these leftists I learned at the city councils and state level, it's always leftists pushing this.
[01:27:16.068 --> 01:27:18.608]  And we've been to these meetings now.
[01:27:18.608 --> 01:27:22.229]  They admit they're lowering IQ and they're a ruling class.
[01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:23.369]  I used to think they were just dumb.
[01:27:23.369 --> 01:27:26.270]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:27.410]  None of them drink it.
[01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:28.751]  Their kids don't get it.
[01:27:28.751 --> 01:27:29.971]  They want to get ahead.
[01:27:29.971 --> 01:27:34.672]  They're so satanic that they love being in on the club where they walk to the mall.
[01:27:35.956 --> 01:27:37.937]  And 50 years ago, there wouldn't be one kid with cancer.
[01:27:37.937 --> 01:27:40.317]  Now, my God, look at half the kids out there dying.
[01:27:40.317 --> 01:27:42.718]  Wow, pediatric cancer is up 50,000 percent or whatever.
[01:27:42.718 --> 01:27:44.838]  Diabetes up 3,000 percent, type 2.
[01:27:44.838 --> 01:27:49.600]  Wow, man, we're really... These people don't know how we killed them.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.621]  And they all filter their water and eat organic and just... And it's their pleasure.
[01:27:55.621 --> 01:27:56.902]  They all go to the Whole Foods.
[01:27:56.902 --> 01:28:02.063]  They all... They all try to stay away from what they're doing to us because it's their ruling class.
[01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:12.741]  And it's just like in ancient Japan, even ancient Europe, you couldn't have a hunting dog if you had it for herding sheep.
[01:28:12.741 --> 01:28:15.966]  They'd cut half its paws off, half its digits off.
[01:28:16.829 --> 01:28:19.171]  So that it could never hunt the king's deer or whatever.
[01:28:19.171 --> 01:28:23.515]  And they'd also make sure the lower levels didn't get enough food to ever be straight and strong.
[01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:26.758]  That's a thing of feudalism to, like bonsai trees, keep them little.
[01:28:26.758 --> 01:28:27.939]  The nobles will be big.
[01:28:27.939 --> 01:28:29.441]  Ha ha ha!
[01:28:29.441 --> 01:28:30.602]  Little people serve me!
[01:28:30.602 --> 01:28:32.784]  I told a free number to join us to talk about this.
[01:28:32.784 --> 01:28:35.586]  I guess we're all going to keep drinking and giving to our kids, right?
[01:28:35.586 --> 01:28:37.188]  Watch the eyes dim.
[01:28:37.188 --> 01:28:38.969]  Celebrate our Luciferian pleasure.
[01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:40.090]  877-789-2539.
[01:28:40.090 --> 01:28:40.370]  877-789-Alex.
[01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.530]  877-789-2539.
[01:28:40.530 --> 01:28:42.311]  What do you think about this?
[01:28:42.311 --> 01:28:44.251]  What are we gonna do about this?
[01:28:44.251 --> 01:28:44.512]  Nothing!
[01:28:44.512 --> 01:28:46.172]  Tell your children!
[01:28:46.172 --> 01:28:46.992]  Tell them for Lucifer!
[01:28:56.345 --> 01:29:01.426]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:01.426 --> 01:29:06.767]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[01:29:06.767 --> 01:29:14.828]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[01:29:14.828 --> 01:29:20.269]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.
[01:29:20.269 --> 01:29:22.250]  Go to BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:24.090]  That's BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:25.703 --> 01:29:28.304]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[01:29:28.304 --> 01:29:29.365]  Get back to nature.
[01:29:29.365 --> 01:29:36.527]  Expand your horizons with the highest quality, most versatile, unique slingshots and sling bows on the market at slingbow.com.
[01:29:36.527 --> 01:29:40.169]  Slingbow products are compact and models start from just $17.98.
[01:29:40.169 --> 01:29:43.390]  They're perfect for your bug out bag or storing in your vehicle.
[01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:47.472]  Give yourself and your loved ones the excitement and tradition of slingbow.
[01:29:47.472 --> 01:29:51.954]  A new frontier in archery and truly modern twist on this primitive survival tool.
[01:29:51.954 --> 01:29:54.595]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[01:29:57.150 --> 01:29:59.571]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[01:29:59.571 --> 01:30:03.033]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[01:30:03.033 --> 01:30:04.574]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[01:30:04.574 --> 01:30:05.895]  I want to take the globalist on.
[01:30:05.895 --> 01:30:07.856]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[01:30:07.856 --> 01:30:13.019]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[01:30:13.019 --> 01:30:15.980]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:16.721]  We got coffee.
[01:30:16.721 --> 01:30:17.601]  We got fish oil.
[01:30:17.601 --> 01:30:18.382]  We got turmeric.
[01:30:18.382 --> 01:30:19.362]  We got great toothpaste.
[01:30:19.362 --> 01:30:21.764]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[01:30:21.764 --> 01:30:24.205]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[01:30:24.445 --> 01:30:27.027]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[01:30:27.027 --> 01:30:28.508]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[01:30:28.508 --> 01:30:30.870]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil.
[01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:37.636]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[01:30:37.636 --> 01:30:43.441]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[01:30:43.441 --> 01:30:45.703]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[01:30:45.703 --> 01:30:46.643]  This has not been.
[01:30:46.643 --> 01:30:50.927]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[01:30:51.228 --> 01:30:52.853]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[01:30:52.853 --> 01:30:53.535]  It's not yellow.
[01:30:53.535 --> 01:30:54.418]  It's not milky.
[01:30:54.418 --> 01:30:55.982]  This is nothing but krill oil.

[01:31:56.367 --> 01:32:09.549]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[01:32:09.549 --> 01:32:13.490]  And today the communist Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago.
[01:32:14.210 --> 01:32:23.076]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the President, and what he's doing in this trade war, once China put pressure on our farmers.
[01:32:23.076 --> 01:32:24.097]  That's beautiful.
[01:32:24.097 --> 01:32:25.999]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:32:25.999 --> 01:32:27.620]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:35.205]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:32:35.205 --> 01:32:37.547]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:32:37.547 --> 01:32:41.710]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:42.631]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:32:43.411 --> 01:32:47.533]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:32:47.533 --> 01:32:48.633]  We are the resistance.
[01:32:48.633 --> 01:33:00.357]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[01:33:00.357 --> 01:33:03.018]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:11.622 --> 01:33:13.744]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.744 --> 01:33:29.861]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:29.861 --> 01:33:31.523]  Water, water everywhere.
[01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:34.345]  Not a drop to drink.
[01:33:34.345 --> 01:33:34.486]  So,
[01:33:37.085 --> 01:33:44.746]  I'm here looking at the actual government documents, official policy, fluoride to lower your IQ, fluoride to lower your fertility.
[01:33:44.746 --> 01:33:45.226]  They've done it.
[01:33:45.226 --> 01:33:48.687]  You can type in US IQs plummeting.
[01:33:48.687 --> 01:33:49.987]  That's genetic.
[01:33:49.987 --> 01:33:51.068]  That's chemical.
[01:33:51.068 --> 01:33:52.608]  That's physical.
[01:33:52.608 --> 01:33:56.869]  And I just showed you all these big new studies that came out from JAMA, you name it.
[01:33:56.869 --> 01:34:02.110]  Okay, it's giving you cancer, it's lowering your IQ, especially men.
[01:34:02.110 --> 01:34:04.330]  And their answer is to come out and attack me.
[01:34:06.226 --> 01:34:07.406]  Because I think it's sick.
[01:34:07.406 --> 01:34:07.986]  I think it's evil.
[01:34:07.986 --> 01:34:08.847]  I think it's horrible.
[01:34:08.847 --> 01:34:10.767]  You know all about the Tuskegee experiments.
[01:34:10.767 --> 01:34:13.228]  You know all about the secret testing.
[01:34:13.228 --> 01:34:16.769]  You know all about the stuff that's gone on and happened.
[01:34:16.769 --> 01:34:19.189]  And it's a criminal group inside Western governments.
[01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:27.671]  It's a scientific dictatorship that is carrying all of this out.
[01:34:27.671 --> 01:34:30.012]  And they know what they're doing.
[01:34:30.012 --> 01:34:32.172]  And it's premeditated.
[01:34:32.172 --> 01:34:34.633]  So what do we do about that?
[01:34:34.633 --> 01:34:34.893]  Because
[01:34:36.204 --> 01:34:38.145]  Seventy-something percent of the country's fluoridated.
[01:34:38.145 --> 01:34:41.227]  They're fluoridating about half of Europe now.
[01:34:41.227 --> 01:34:56.036]  And I've gone with Harvard and Princeton top toxicologists, and I've shown them universal letters signed by the unions of these federal agencies.
[01:34:56.036 --> 01:34:57.117]  Universal!
[01:34:57.117 --> 01:34:58.998]  Saying, we want this out.
[01:34:58.998 --> 01:35:02.060]  So see, 99% of the government's not bad people.
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:03.521]  But it stays in.
[01:35:03.521 --> 01:35:04.642]  I showed you last segment
[01:35:05.757 --> 01:35:06.917]  Studies from the U.S.
[01:35:06.917 --> 01:35:07.558]  government!
[01:35:07.558 --> 01:35:11.059]  Warnings!
[01:35:11.059 --> 01:35:17.441]  I mean, this isn't like Prop 65 where there's one part, again, per billion of lead in the air, but they say it can't be in food.
[01:35:17.441 --> 01:35:18.142]  That's impossible.
[01:35:18.142 --> 01:35:20.523]  It has no effects on you.
[01:35:20.523 --> 01:35:23.684]  It's non-detectable in almost all systems.
[01:35:23.684 --> 01:35:28.746]  We're talking about ten parts per hundred in some of these toothpastes?
[01:35:28.746 --> 01:35:33.788]  I mean, that's a psychological and mental death sentence!
[01:35:33.788 --> 01:35:34.208]  What it is,
[01:35:35.765 --> 01:35:39.766]  It is a chemical weapon to induce a biological effect.
[01:35:39.766 --> 01:35:43.067]  It is a chemical lobotomy.
[01:35:43.067 --> 01:35:52.350]  And you warn people about this, and they just go, oh, I heard that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:35:52.350 --> 01:36:01.813]  Because we all saw Dr. Strangelove and Stanley Kubrick, who was putting that in there to warn people about it, but the only way to get it past the system was to make it a joke.
[01:36:03.735 --> 01:36:08.460]  to tie it to end of the world nuclear weapons and fluoride.
[01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:17.749]  See, you can die from nuclear weapons, you can die from fluoride, you can die from the big quick weapon, or you can die from the slow weapon, the silent weapon, for quiet wars.
[01:36:17.749 --> 01:36:18.890]  That's another Pentagon paper.
[01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:26.378]  So I'm going to go to your phone calls, but it was Connor, who's a big exercise aficionado, swimmer,
[01:36:27.742 --> 01:36:33.044]  And he said, yeah, you're talking about women having twice as strong, on average, blood-brain barriers as men.
[01:36:33.044 --> 01:36:34.584]  And that's why they don't get as much autism.
[01:36:34.584 --> 01:36:38.125]  It's why they don't get their IQ lowered as much.
[01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:40.566]  Fluoride mainly targets men.
[01:36:40.566 --> 01:36:43.347]  It hurts women really bad.
[01:36:43.347 --> 01:36:45.987]  I mean, it's like shooting three bullets into you instead of six.
[01:36:45.987 --> 01:36:48.868]  It still doesn't feel too good.
[01:36:48.868 --> 01:36:55.150]  But males are geared for quick action, strength, not really defensive.
[01:36:57.216 --> 01:37:02.518]  That's why, again, female babies are twice as strong at being able to take insults.
[01:37:02.518 --> 01:37:06.019]  That's what the medical system calls being cut, being shot, being poisoned.
[01:37:06.019 --> 01:37:10.201]  Insults to the nervous system that men can take.
[01:37:10.201 --> 01:37:12.762]  Men are, on average, twice as strong muscularly.
[01:37:12.762 --> 01:37:14.902]  Men, on average, have better vision.
[01:37:14.902 --> 01:37:15.503]  We're all different.
[01:37:15.503 --> 01:37:16.983]  Like, they have a womb.
[01:37:16.983 --> 01:37:18.944]  They are designed to protect that.
[01:37:20.822 --> 01:37:23.324]  And try to build little nesties and things.
[01:37:23.324 --> 01:37:24.265]  That's how we're designed.
[01:37:24.265 --> 01:37:26.686]  And the men go out and defend the nest and bring things back into the nest.
[01:37:26.686 --> 01:37:29.068]  Well, they've already broken that up.
[01:37:29.068 --> 01:37:40.957]  So the human system is being destroyed before your eyes, and then they introduce, right out of Russian gulags and Nazi death camps, fluoridated water.
[01:37:40.957 --> 01:37:42.057]  And that's a historical fact.
[01:37:42.057 --> 01:37:47.461]  And the only reason I'm hammering it now is people always ask me, hey, you don't cover fluoride as much.
[01:37:47.461 --> 01:37:49.002]  And I say, man, I've made documentaries.
[01:37:49.002 --> 01:37:49.543]  I've probably done
[01:37:51.544 --> 01:37:57.709]  A thousand shows on it, I had all these scientists, and I would have scientists.
[01:37:57.709 --> 01:38:06.656]  I'd get those guys back on, brain surges, you name it, and I'd bring them down to city council, and the mayors would laugh at them.
[01:38:06.656 --> 01:38:09.158]  They'd say, here's all the studies, here's the facts, blah, blah, blah.
[01:38:09.158 --> 01:38:16.484]  I'd go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
[01:38:17.756 --> 01:38:19.577]  Because they know about the Epstein.
[01:38:19.577 --> 01:38:20.797]  And they know about the globalists.
[01:38:20.797 --> 01:38:21.778]  They know about the world government.
[01:38:21.778 --> 01:38:24.179]  They know about radical Islam being funded and protected.
[01:38:24.179 --> 01:38:25.920]  And they don't trust the system anymore.
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:28.621]  And they don't trust mainstream media.
[01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:29.961]  The system has cratered.
[01:38:29.961 --> 01:38:33.783]  That's why they're trying to start a race war to start it all over again.
[01:38:33.783 --> 01:38:40.226]  With a civil war so bad that all of this gets forgotten.
[01:38:40.226 --> 01:38:47.269]  You know, we were given a tour of the water treatment plant that I'm going to recall is here in Austin.
[01:38:48.354 --> 01:38:51.556]  And they said, don't shoot video, wink wink, but let us.
[01:38:51.556 --> 01:38:53.238]  And there's skull and crossbones all over the fluoride.
[01:38:53.238 --> 01:38:55.579]  They said if one drop gets on you, it eats through your skin.
[01:38:55.579 --> 01:38:59.362]  They show where a drop got on the concrete and ate three inches of the concrete.
[01:38:59.362 --> 01:39:07.547]  The only acid, there's a few acids out there that act like the fictitious, fictional alien blood in the movie Alien and Aliens.
[01:39:07.547 --> 01:39:14.732]  Pure fluoride, hydrofluorosilicic, literally eats through concrete like a hot knife through butter.
[01:39:14.732 --> 01:39:16.594]  Now what do you think that does inside your body?
[01:39:17.347 --> 01:39:25.491]  It grabs all the other toxins, they all link up with it and just delivers hell through your tissues.
[01:39:25.491 --> 01:39:27.291]  In fact, it's one of the biggest causes of cancer.
[01:39:27.291 --> 01:39:29.952]  But where are the lawyers suing Oberfloride?
[01:39:29.952 --> 01:39:32.974]  They know not to do it.
[01:39:32.974 --> 01:39:43.058]  Even though it's open and shut because it's just like the chem trailing.
[01:39:43.058 --> 01:39:44.939]  It's just like
[01:39:46.724 --> 01:39:50.945]  The chemtrailing.
[01:39:50.945 --> 01:40:06.151]  CFR, former CIA director, comes out, says, yeah, we're adding barium sulfate dioxide as jet fuel for the major suppliers, and then it creates nuclear in the atmosphere, and we control the weather.
[01:40:06.151 --> 01:40:07.171]  We block out the sun.
[01:40:07.171 --> 01:40:11.993]  And then Bill Gates comes out in Smithsonian Magazine a week ago and says, yeah, we're doing it.
[01:40:11.993 --> 01:40:12.513]  We're spraying you.
[01:40:13.865 --> 01:40:17.168]  And it's like, Jones, you are really discredited now.
[01:40:17.168 --> 01:40:19.931]  Jones, you are the filth of the planet.
[01:40:19.931 --> 01:40:21.653]  Exactly as I said with Epstein.
[01:40:21.653 --> 01:40:26.799]  I said he's into eugenics, he's into death cults, he's into Satanism, and he's into cloning.
[01:40:26.799 --> 01:40:28.340]  That hasn't come out yet.
[01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:32.765]  You watch, the cloning's gonna come out.
[01:40:32.765 --> 01:40:36.429]  What do you think he was being given all these mysterious millions for?
[01:40:38.174 --> 01:40:57.927]  He was an investment of the Albert Einstein Institute that he headed up to carry out the development of a planetary regime to carry out the extermination of the human population and the rise of the Superman, in German, Ubermensch.
[01:40:57.927 --> 01:40:59.168]  You can go watch my film, Endgame.
[01:40:59.168 --> 01:41:02.810]  I show you that institute, I show you who's at it.
[01:41:02.810 --> 01:41:04.231]  Could have gone and seen the head, Epstein.
[01:41:07.037 --> 01:41:10.958]  They're abusing the children for trauma-based mind control.
[01:41:10.958 --> 01:41:17.179]  Again, the 15 and 14-year-old girls, they're just the outer room.
[01:41:17.179 --> 01:41:18.879]  We're going to go to break.
[01:41:18.879 --> 01:41:19.900]  I'll be right back with your calls.
[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.681]  But it was Connor saying, hey, you're absolutely right.
[01:41:24.681 --> 01:41:31.842]  And the way to boost your blood-brain barrier and your very brain tissue itself to be more resistant to all of this is DHE.
[01:41:31.842 --> 01:41:35.683]  And what has the strongest, purest DHE out there?
[01:41:35.683 --> 01:41:35.983]  Krillin.
[01:41:38.772 --> 01:41:44.898]  Krill Oil, ladies and gentlemen, and we sell the very best Krill Oil.
[01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:54.127]  You can find 100% reviews, InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:41:54.127 --> 01:41:56.349]  Takes you right to it, and it's been sold out for three months.
[01:41:56.349 --> 01:41:58.952]  We just got it back in, but it's still discounted 50%.
[01:42:01.491 --> 01:42:04.053]  And we've got to end that special soon, because it's going to sell out.
[01:42:04.053 --> 01:42:09.858]  I told Chris, double order that next time, because people now get how important krill oil is.
[01:42:09.858 --> 01:42:19.386]  We also have honor roll, that's for children, that's a mixture of different key oils for the brain and the heart, and it's just all the barriers, the cell walls,
[01:42:21.596 --> 01:42:27.138]  The ventricles in the heart, but you know, it's also the anti-inflammatory, DHE.
[01:42:27.138 --> 01:42:34.280]  And so for me, the reason I like it is I like to have really cool, full-color, awesome dreams.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.041]  And well, dreams a little bit more now, we all know that.
[01:42:37.041 --> 01:42:38.801]  So I like to go places in my sleep.
[01:42:38.801 --> 01:42:41.862]  So I gobbled, and I'm not saying you should do this, I gobbled.
[01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:49.326]  I think it was the two krills, some honor rolls, and our ultimate finisher of the night.
[01:42:49.326 --> 01:42:52.707]  And boy, man, that was amazing sleep.
[01:42:52.707 --> 01:42:58.669]  InfoWorksStore.com to fund the rebellion.
[01:42:58.669 --> 01:43:02.110]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[01:43:02.110 --> 01:43:06.151]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:43:06.151 --> 01:43:08.032]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:43:08.032 --> 01:43:11.913]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:43:14.841 --> 01:43:17.982]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:43:17.982 --> 01:43:19.962]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:43:19.962 --> 01:43:23.743]  The high court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:43:23.743 --> 01:43:35.045]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:43:35.045 --> 01:43:38.486]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[01:43:46.659 --> 01:43:50.623]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:43:50.623 --> 01:43:51.964]  You can't watch this!

[01:44:57.443 --> 01:44:59.425]  Robert Morris, what has Big Tech become?
[01:44:59.425 --> 01:45:01.447]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[01:45:01.447 --> 01:45:07.973]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[01:45:07.973 --> 01:45:20.044]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[01:45:20.044 --> 01:45:21.225]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[01:45:21.485 --> 01:45:23.847]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[01:45:51.425 --> 01:45:53.213]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[01:45:53.213 --> 01:45:55.162]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:45:55.162 --> 01:45:56.407]  Even it is what you just saw.
[01:45:57.890 --> 01:46:14.578]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are, and how they were the best, and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:46:14.578 --> 01:46:18.659]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down.
[01:46:18.659 --> 01:46:21.981]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements, because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[01:46:22.341 --> 01:46:24.102]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:46:24.102 --> 01:46:27.004]  Jones sells unapproved supplements.
[01:46:27.004 --> 01:46:28.345]  And he claims they're supplements.
[01:46:28.345 --> 01:46:36.289]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:46:36.289 --> 01:46:38.991]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[01:46:38.991 --> 01:46:43.894]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:46:43.894 --> 01:46:45.094]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:46:45.094 --> 01:46:45.915]  They have side effects.
[01:46:46.055 --> 01:46:50.656]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:46:50.656 --> 01:46:52.337]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:52.337 --> 01:46:55.038]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:46:55.038 --> 01:46:55.758]  Be my Frankenstein!
[01:47:23.078 --> 01:47:24.439]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:24.439 --> 01:47:26.439]  I'm going to your calls now.
[01:47:26.439 --> 01:47:33.862]  And then coming up at the bottom of the next hour, Joey Gibson's going to pop in, but I'm going to Tim and Ryan and Alex and everybody else here in about a minute.
[01:47:33.862 --> 01:47:37.223]  I want to just go back to plugging here.
[01:47:37.223 --> 01:47:44.566]  Because I didn't plug anything to the very end of the first hour, and I was here doing accounting yesterday, and I don't like to sit here and complain.
[01:47:44.566 --> 01:47:50.188]  And I don't think this is really the time to get into this, but there's two different paths we can go down, because I've never given up.
[01:47:51.010 --> 01:48:00.513]  I can massively downsize in about a year, so everybody's still got their job.
[01:48:00.513 --> 01:48:03.694]  Or, I can figure out how to get more money into here.
[01:48:03.694 --> 01:48:05.595]  I mean, it's really simple.
[01:48:05.595 --> 01:48:06.796]  See, here's the deal.
[01:48:06.796 --> 01:48:09.436]  We got great customers that buy the products.
[01:48:09.436 --> 01:48:19.120]  And so, if I sell all the inventory we have, some of it's out to six months, of t-shirts, books, films, supplements, because we're self-funding.
[01:48:20.342 --> 01:48:33.646]  I can pay all the bills for a year, but I've now hit a point in the mathematics, because folks like raises and bonuses and I want to expand and I want to fight hard.
[01:48:33.646 --> 01:48:44.110]  So I'm in a race and I've got so much gas before my next pit stop to refuel, and I'm going to push it one more lap to win the race, but I might run out of gas before I finish the race, but if I pull over,
[01:48:45.456 --> 01:48:47.177]  And to the pit stop, I don't think we'll make it.
[01:48:47.177 --> 01:48:49.359]  I mean, so I've really been praying about this.
[01:48:49.359 --> 01:48:51.400]  And I mean praying hard.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:53.782]  And really, I just told myself, you got to cut better ads.
[01:48:53.782 --> 01:48:55.763]  You got to explain how good these products are.
[01:48:55.763 --> 01:49:01.007]  And you've just really got to get up off your ass and explain to the listeners that this is serious.
[01:49:01.007 --> 01:49:01.967]  Because it's always serious.
[01:49:01.967 --> 01:49:02.928]  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:49:02.928 --> 01:49:05.750]  They've taken our sponsors, harassed us, sued us over the years.
[01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:06.630]  I mean, you know what's going on.
[01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:08.872]  They tried to plant child porn on us.
[01:49:08.872 --> 01:49:11.213]  It's been incredible.
[01:49:11.213 --> 01:49:14.676]  And we cut the fat.
[01:49:15.697 --> 01:49:16.397]  Down to the bone.
[01:49:16.397 --> 01:49:17.478]  We figured out a lot of things.
[01:49:17.478 --> 01:49:23.181]  I've gotten better at business and a lot of things to be able to still be on air.
[01:49:23.181 --> 01:49:25.342]  And you've come through spreading the word and your financial support.
[01:49:25.342 --> 01:49:30.625]  But I want to add some more shows, which are happening next month.
[01:49:30.625 --> 01:49:31.846]  And I want to fight back.
[01:49:31.846 --> 01:49:35.287]  And I want to be able to defeat these lawsuits, which I can do.
[01:49:35.287 --> 01:49:35.928]  We beat a lot of them.
[01:49:35.928 --> 01:49:38.629]  You'll never hear that in the news.
[01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:39.710]  But I really need people to understand
[01:49:40.512 --> 01:49:53.970]  Hey, if I just go sign up for auto-ship so I don't forget, and I get my coffee, and I get my fluoride-free toothpaste, fortified with ionic little silver, and if I get my fish oil and my krill oil, things everybody should be taking.
[01:49:53.970 --> 01:49:54.811]  And my water filtration.
[01:49:56.792 --> 01:50:01.454]  And if you had a filter two, three years, Alexa Pure Appropriate, probably time to replace those filters.
[01:50:01.454 --> 01:50:09.338]  They're already rated the highest quality out there, and you're like, yeah, they're half the price of stuff at a fancy store, because they mark stuff up three, four times.
[01:50:09.338 --> 01:50:10.779]  And you know, that's how they stay in business.
[01:50:10.779 --> 01:50:12.800]  We don't do that.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:16.081]  I make 70 bucks on a filter at full price, you know, the big ones.
[01:50:16.081 --> 01:50:16.802]  When it's on sale, $35.
[01:50:19.654 --> 01:50:23.095]  And so we bring in a ton of money, but we've got smart listeners.
[01:50:23.095 --> 01:50:30.857]  We've got Midwest and Texans and folks out West and farmers and people in the, you know, blue collar folks, you know, and the East Coast everywhere.
[01:50:30.857 --> 01:50:39.900]  And, and, and, you know, a lot of business people and they're all shrewd and you come by stuff from us because we've got good deals, but take the ultimate krill oil.
[01:50:42.415 --> 01:50:46.137]  The ultimate krill oil, ladies and gentlemen, is the ultimate krill oil.
[01:50:46.137 --> 01:50:49.399]  We went out and found the highest rated organic one that does the process.
[01:50:49.399 --> 01:50:52.841]  If there's any mercury to remove it, that's what triples the cost for us.
[01:50:52.841 --> 01:51:01.567]  It's already super low in krill, but we know we're getting tested in California by their standards that are impossible to pass, so we go to the insane level.
[01:51:01.567 --> 01:51:06.150]  And you notice this is just that beautiful red of krill, and you couldn't do something better for your body and your life.
[01:51:07.242 --> 01:51:08.823]  And then separately, we've got the T-shirts.
[01:51:08.823 --> 01:51:16.429]  We're almost sold out of the Chris Pratt-inspired shirts, which is Don't Tread on Me, with the Betsy Ross flag that triggers the libtards so bad.
[01:51:16.429 --> 01:51:21.453]  We've got the limited edition Space Force shirt that we're about to redesign.
[01:51:21.453 --> 01:51:22.934]  It'll be a new limited edition.
[01:51:22.934 --> 01:51:30.299]  But if you want to help fund the operation and get great threads, both those shirts have that real soft, nice fabric.
[01:51:30.299 --> 01:51:32.301]  I mean, I know the Space Shuttle shirt cost us like $12 a piece.
[01:51:34.693 --> 01:51:36.794]  So when we're selling it for $9.95, that is a really good deal.
[01:51:36.794 --> 01:51:38.814]  I mean, it's just really nice fabric.
[01:51:38.814 --> 01:51:40.615]  It's a high-quality designer t-shirt.
[01:51:40.615 --> 01:51:42.556]  Ball caps, it's all there at FortWorthShore.com.
[01:51:42.556 --> 01:51:43.636]  Okay, I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:51:43.636 --> 01:51:45.537]  I'm done plugging.
[01:51:45.537 --> 01:51:50.238]  It's just, these are products you already need, and it funds the operation.
[01:51:50.238 --> 01:52:01.922]  So things you're gonna reorder, like protein bars, or like TurboForce, or things like BrainForce, or things like the toothpaste, or things like the coffee, just sign up for AutoShip.
[01:52:03.729 --> 01:52:07.910]  You sign up for every month, every two months, every three months, and just one click, it's free, you cancel.
[01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:13.152]  But it just keeps coming so you don't forget, and then we know that that's there each month to support what we're doing.
[01:52:13.152 --> 01:52:14.193]  Very simple.
[01:52:14.193 --> 01:52:18.794]  Shop with us, we save the Second Amendment, pull the fluoride out of the water, it's happening all across the country.
[01:52:18.794 --> 01:52:23.096]  I think we're down to like 60% now, instead of 75 a few years ago.
[01:52:23.096 --> 01:52:24.816]  I mean, we're winning, folks.
[01:52:24.816 --> 01:52:29.838]  But, we're winning the info war, but this operation is shot full of holes.
[01:52:29.838 --> 01:52:32.359]  And so, the dry dock is you buying stuff.
[01:52:33.431 --> 01:52:37.014]  And we need that support, so thank you.
[01:52:37.014 --> 01:52:38.855]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:52:38.855 --> 01:52:40.697]  Go to your calls.
[01:52:40.697 --> 01:52:42.198]  Tim, thanks for holding in Montana.
[01:52:42.198 --> 01:52:43.219]  You're on the air worldwide.
[01:52:43.219 --> 01:52:45.921]  Talk about water and the chemicals that are in it.
[01:52:45.921 --> 01:52:47.742]  Go ahead.
[01:52:47.742 --> 01:52:48.242]  Hi, Alex.
[01:52:48.242 --> 01:52:52.446]  Actually, I was going to talk about hydrofluoric acid use in oil refineries.
[01:52:52.446 --> 01:52:59.271]  You know, they use HF acid in oil refineries very extensively and in those areas.
[01:52:59.778 --> 01:53:06.442]  They're painted off, marked very, very significantly to where people obviously know where those areas they're at.
[01:53:06.442 --> 01:53:09.964]  You have to wear special, you know, like rain suits.
[01:53:09.964 --> 01:53:11.865]  You have to have all your cuffs taped off and everything.
[01:53:11.865 --> 01:53:21.651]  They have tools that they only use in those areas because if you get even a small portion of that into your skin, the acid is, it's
[01:53:23.388 --> 01:53:23.988]  I'm good.
[01:53:42.456 --> 01:53:53.286]  Then what they're using in these oil refineries that they take great precautions to prevent their employees from from coming in contact with that and yet we're dumping the stuff that's more acidic in our water.
[01:53:53.286 --> 01:53:54.768]  By the way, you're an incredible caller.
[01:53:54.768 --> 01:53:55.448]  Stay there.
[01:53:55.448 --> 01:54:05.678]  But it sounds like you're either an engineer or a scientist or someone or a roughneck that's really informed because you're absolutely right about that.
[01:54:05.678 --> 01:54:07.259]  And again, all I got to do is type in
[01:54:08.243 --> 01:54:08.503]  Exactly.
[01:54:08.503 --> 01:54:10.625]  The oil and gas refining process
[01:54:24.321 --> 01:54:26.724]  You know, I'm not an engineer or a scientist.
[01:54:26.724 --> 01:54:28.065]  I work in a technical field.
[01:54:28.065 --> 01:54:33.331]  But, you know, I work with oil refineries and I've been in there.
[01:54:33.331 --> 01:54:35.253]  And that's not something you mess around with.
[01:54:35.253 --> 01:54:43.782]  I mean, if you're walking through and you take your hard hat off, you scratch your head and you get a drop on your head, you better hope that that was condensation and not acid.
[01:54:43.782 --> 01:54:44.563]  Because guess what?
[01:54:44.563 --> 01:54:46.305]  You've got a hole in your skull by the morning.
[01:54:46.809 --> 01:55:08.179]  You know it's it is a it's a there was a great video I saw one time that the Honeywell company put out and it was talking about the great precautions you need to take and why and you know there it's it's just amazing to me that people they just want to put their hand in the stand and no no one would ever do anything like that to us it can't be true and that's why Alex I just
[01:55:09.955 --> 01:55:12.817]  When are they going to accept that you're right?
[01:55:12.817 --> 01:55:16.641]  When are they going to admit that, man, this guy, he's got it.
[01:55:16.641 --> 01:55:17.601]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:55:17.601 --> 01:55:22.946]  I mean, everything you do, if you listen, it eventually comes out.
[01:55:22.946 --> 01:55:27.409]  And I tell people all the time, you're where I get my news.
[01:55:27.409 --> 01:55:29.871]  And then I cross-reference, and by God, you're right.
[01:55:29.871 --> 01:55:30.752]  Everything is fine.
[01:55:30.752 --> 01:55:32.514]  Well, Tim, I appreciate you, and God bless you.
[01:55:32.514 --> 01:55:35.436]  Please keep spreading the word, but I don't want to toot my horn here.
[01:55:35.436 --> 01:55:37.357]  Our audience is smarter than I am on most subjects.
[01:55:38.158 --> 01:55:42.062]  It's been known for 100 years what hydrofluorosilicic acid does.
[01:55:42.062 --> 01:55:44.064]  We've had major industry for 200 plus years.
[01:55:44.064 --> 01:55:45.024]  They've known.
[01:55:45.024 --> 01:55:54.413]  Like you said, in the production of gasoline, at the refinery level, and before that, at the exploration level, I mean, they're dealing with all this toxic stuff.
[01:55:54.413 --> 01:56:00.419]  Everybody knows that's why 100% of the FDA scientists in the mid-90s and again in like 2010, was it?
[01:56:02.540 --> 01:56:11.426]  They got every one of their engineers and toxicologists and chemists to sign a letter saying, take it out of the water.
[01:56:11.426 --> 01:56:12.647]  And you know what?
[01:56:12.647 --> 01:56:17.531]  The feds still push and hold back money to the states if they don't floor it.
[01:56:17.531 --> 01:56:21.974]  But you go into any rich person's house or any liberal's house, they're not drinking tap water.
[01:56:21.974 --> 01:56:24.215]  But they have all these initiatives about, oh, you should drink it.
[01:56:24.215 --> 01:56:26.517]  Good, good, good.
[01:56:26.517 --> 01:56:28.238]  These are monsters.
[01:56:28.238 --> 01:56:31.000]  They want to kill babies after they're born.
[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:31.961]  Keep them comfortable.
[01:56:33.166 --> 01:56:38.290]  And so the sooner we come to grips with these monsters, the better.
[01:56:38.290 --> 01:56:44.354]  We'll talk to Alex about Kim's in the water, lowering IQ, making the frogs gay, and I just threw that out there as a pop thing.
[01:56:44.354 --> 01:56:45.955]  It was a headline.
[01:56:45.955 --> 01:56:48.137]  It was like in Berkeley newspapers, making the frogs gay.
[01:56:48.137 --> 01:56:50.099]  Literally, they want male frogs, not females.
[01:56:50.099 --> 01:56:52.921]  They go hump male frogs, and there are no babies.
[01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:55.643]  They don't fertilize the eggs, because there's no eggs coming out the...
[01:56:56.658 --> 01:56:59.603]  Rear end of a male frog, and then the frogs die!
[01:56:59.603 --> 01:57:03.249]  But David Hall goes, that's great, I love things being gay!
[01:57:03.249 --> 01:57:04.531]  What does that even mean?
[01:57:04.531 --> 01:57:09.939]  And so when we go to that next caller, I'll show you the article, there's video of it too.
[01:57:11.084 --> 01:57:15.607]  of large snakes being raped by gangs of toads and frogs.
[01:57:15.607 --> 01:57:16.967]  That's because of the atrazine.
[01:57:16.967 --> 01:57:18.708]  It drives them mad with lust.
[01:57:18.708 --> 01:57:24.892]  I've got the headline here is, lusting toads, gang rape, large snake.
[01:57:24.892 --> 01:57:32.176]  And they say the phenomenon is so bad that they'll pile up on them until the snake basically just dies.
[01:57:32.176 --> 01:57:36.198]  It's just all these frogs hopping on it, raping it.
[01:57:36.198 --> 01:57:37.779]  So, frogs are driving...
[01:57:39.184 --> 01:57:41.426]  It's just, it's incredible what they do.
[01:57:41.426 --> 01:57:42.587]  You'll see the video for yourself.
[01:57:42.587 --> 01:57:45.669]  Stay with us.
[01:57:45.669 --> 01:57:58.838]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:57:58.838 --> 01:58:01.761]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:58:01.761 --> 01:58:03.522]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:58:03.522 --> 01:58:07.165]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president,
[01:58:07.805 --> 01:58:12.346]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:58:12.346 --> 01:58:13.386]  That's beautiful.
[01:58:13.386 --> 01:58:15.287]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:58:15.287 --> 01:58:16.887]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:58:16.887 --> 01:58:24.489]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:58:24.489 --> 01:58:26.810]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:58:26.810 --> 01:58:30.971]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:58:30.971 --> 01:58:31.911]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:58:32.711 --> 01:58:36.841]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:58:36.841 --> 01:58:37.924]  We are the resistance.
[01:58:37.924 --> 01:58:38.566]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[01:58:46.937 --> 01:58:48.278]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:58:48.278 --> 01:58:49.058]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:58:49.058 --> 01:58:49.638]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:49.638 --> 01:58:50.159]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:50.159 --> 01:58:52.980]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:59.084]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:58:59.084 --> 01:59:07.889]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[01:59:07.889 --> 01:59:08.849]  That's it.
[01:59:08.849 --> 01:59:11.711]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:14.552]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:59:14.552 --> 01:59:15.833]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:16.013 --> 01:59:16.753]  I agree entirely.
[01:59:16.753 --> 01:59:22.215]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:22.215 --> 01:59:24.996]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:59:24.996 --> 01:59:27.056]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:59:27.056 --> 01:59:36.279]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:59:36.279 --> 01:59:38.220]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:44.702]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:44.702 --> 01:59:45.642]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:49.770 --> 02:00:05.381]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:05.381 --> 02:00:09.144]  Taking your phone calls, Jelly Gibson's popping in.
[02:00:09.144 --> 02:00:12.507]  Fresh off the heels of being arrested for daring to go to Portland.
[02:00:13.558 --> 02:00:20.480]  The Proud Boys have been convicted in New York for defending themselves by a sycophantic jury that was told they were the racist.
[02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:21.860]  What are their Nazis in?
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:25.621]  15 years in prison!
[02:00:25.621 --> 02:00:30.202]  But right now, we're going back to your phone calls.
[02:00:30.202 --> 02:00:32.043]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in Michigan.
[02:00:32.043 --> 02:00:32.783]  Alex, you're on the air.
[02:00:32.783 --> 02:00:34.624]  Welcome.
[02:00:34.624 --> 02:00:36.564]  Thanks so much for taking my call, Alex.
[02:00:36.564 --> 02:00:39.825]  What an honor to be a part of this legendary broadcast today.
[02:00:39.825 --> 02:00:40.125]  Thank you, sir.
[02:00:41.004 --> 02:00:59.197]  You're doing an amazing job exposing the hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water, mainly from China, the vaccines causing autism, the chemtrails, the human clones, the GMOs, big pharma dumping Prozac in the water, and of course the atrazine and BPA estrogen mimickers turning the frogs gay.
[02:01:00.791 --> 02:01:07.636]  And you have the solution if everyone went to InfoWareStore.com and bought a water filter and the X2 and the bodies.
[02:01:07.636 --> 02:01:11.339]  Actually, there's a lot of studies on turmeric being able to get fluoride out of the brain.
[02:01:11.339 --> 02:01:13.501]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:13.501 --> 02:01:17.204]  I mean, we just promote everything that's super good and we're against everything that's super bad, so...
[02:01:18.137 --> 02:01:18.938]  We like sunshine.
[02:01:18.938 --> 02:01:19.678]  We like green grass.
[02:01:19.678 --> 02:01:20.458]  We like Jesus.
[02:01:20.458 --> 02:01:21.659]  We like America.
[02:01:21.659 --> 02:01:22.740]  We like the Second Amendment.
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:24.261]  We like capitalism.
[02:01:24.261 --> 02:01:25.261]  We like the free market.
[02:01:25.261 --> 02:01:26.822]  We like liberty.
[02:01:26.822 --> 02:01:29.844]  And, you know, we don't like chemicals that sterilize us and kill us.
[02:01:29.844 --> 02:01:30.805]  And so that's why we're against this.
[02:01:30.805 --> 02:01:33.146]  I wouldn't say I'm a hero for harping on this.
[02:01:33.146 --> 02:01:41.211]  I just can't believe they've gotten away with this so long when they admit it's designed to literally sterilize us and kill us.
[02:01:41.211 --> 02:01:41.691]  Exactly.
[02:01:41.691 --> 02:01:46.134]  And I know this is a little controversial, but cannabis has been shown to also reverse autism.
[02:01:47.887 --> 02:01:49.509]  Just something to throw out there.
[02:01:49.509 --> 02:01:55.254]  Of course, organic cannabis, none of the George Soros Monsanto pesticide crap out there.
[02:01:55.254 --> 02:02:00.959]  But also, spirulina is a good option, too, if you wanted to add that to the InfoWare store.
[02:02:00.959 --> 02:02:04.923]  Spirulina algae is another solution to get gunk out of your body.
[02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:08.211]  And I just want to throw this out there, Alex.
[02:02:08.211 --> 02:02:15.154]  If you need help with your InfoWars operation as a listener and fan, I want to do everything I can to support you.
[02:02:15.154 --> 02:02:18.415]  If you ever need any help, I'll come down there to Texas.
[02:02:18.415 --> 02:02:21.357]  I'll pull a Ted Nugent and work for minimum wage.
[02:02:21.357 --> 02:02:21.737]  I don't care.
[02:02:21.737 --> 02:02:23.958]  I'm kind of a minimalist.
[02:02:23.958 --> 02:02:24.678]  Just throwing it out there.
[02:02:25.856 --> 02:02:32.038]  Well, if we don't get the funding, we may have to do that down the road, but we've kind of got a lean, mean fighting machine right now, and it's not that we don't want help.
[02:02:32.038 --> 02:02:35.019]  It's just that we're trying to get it all developed and all set up.
[02:02:35.019 --> 02:02:43.582]  You know, I found a really, really funny meme page, that whole bunch of Alex Jones gay frog memes, and where Alex Jones is holding back the gay chemicals from everybody.
[02:02:43.582 --> 02:02:46.283]  No, folks, it's funny, but it's not.
[02:02:46.283 --> 02:02:47.184]  But at least it gets
[02:02:48.284 --> 02:02:51.627]  The information out to everybody to have a larger discussion.
[02:02:51.627 --> 02:02:52.708]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:52.708 --> 02:02:57.212]  Let me give folks some viewer discretion is advised.
[02:02:57.212 --> 02:03:00.255]  We're going to put this up on TV screen for folks.
[02:03:00.255 --> 02:03:02.397]  This is from the CBC.
[02:03:02.397 --> 02:03:07.362]  And warning, this is gay frog rape photos and video.
[02:03:07.362 --> 02:03:09.143]  And I'm not being funny here.
[02:03:09.143 --> 02:03:13.947]  This is a horny, confused cane toads are humping a python, says biologist.
[02:03:14.668 --> 02:03:22.312]  These cane toads, pictured above, on the back of a python.
[02:03:22.312 --> 02:03:27.134]  In Australia, we're actually blind with lust, says the amphibian expert.
[02:03:27.134 --> 02:03:36.639]  And then it goes into how, again, this is happening more and more, because they are dealing with all of the atrazine and the rest of it.
[02:03:36.639 --> 02:03:38.840]  But it's cute and fun to be gay now!
[02:03:38.840 --> 02:03:42.562]  And then, of course, they just die.
[02:03:42.562 --> 02:03:43.302]  But getting serious.
[02:03:46.087 --> 02:03:47.447]  They try to make a joke out of all this.
[02:03:47.447 --> 02:03:48.288]  It's not funny.
[02:03:48.288 --> 02:03:51.108]  Here's CNN.
[02:03:51.108 --> 02:03:53.329]  Once in a while being truthful.
[02:03:53.329 --> 02:03:55.449]  IQ scores are falling and have been for decades.
[02:03:55.449 --> 02:03:57.510]  New study finds.
[02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:04.471]  And again, fluoride is on record as the main cause.
[02:04:04.471 --> 02:04:05.672]  Why do you think?
[02:04:05.672 --> 02:04:06.712]  These studies are always coming out.
[02:04:06.712 --> 02:04:08.612]  Why is it so big now?
[02:04:08.612 --> 02:04:10.253]  Why would Yahoo put it on the front page now?
[02:04:10.253 --> 02:04:11.313]  Because before they'd hide that.
[02:04:13.592 --> 02:04:14.693]  Because the study's also the same thing.
[02:04:14.693 --> 02:04:16.774]  I mean, it's conclusive.
[02:04:16.774 --> 02:04:20.976]  Like, shooting yourself in the head with a gun isn't good for you, it probably will kill you at work.
[02:04:20.976 --> 02:04:23.117]  If you take cyanide, it's gonna kill you.
[02:04:23.117 --> 02:04:29.900]  You take a lethal dose of cyanide, a gram of it, you're gonna die!
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:37.483]  Well, you drink fluoride, you're gonna have little bitty genitals, and it's gonna eat holes in your brain.
[02:04:37.483 --> 02:04:38.084]  And you're gonna be...
[02:04:39.031 --> 02:04:40.633]  Partially sterile.
[02:04:40.633 --> 02:04:42.556]  So, why the hell are they doing it?
[02:04:42.556 --> 02:04:46.762]  Because they're eugenicists who want you to be dumb so they can out-compete you!
[02:04:46.762 --> 02:04:47.783]  They're jerks!
[02:04:47.783 --> 02:04:48.684]  They're criminals!
[02:04:48.684 --> 02:04:49.505]  They're leftists!
[02:04:49.505 --> 02:04:50.767]  They're devil worshippers!
[02:04:50.767 --> 02:04:52.029]  They're child rapists!
[02:04:52.029 --> 02:04:52.490]  They're evil!
[02:04:54.619 --> 02:04:58.802]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:04:58.802 --> 02:04:59.863]  They are technocrats.
[02:04:59.863 --> 02:05:02.165]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:05:02.165 --> 02:05:09.651]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:05:09.651 --> 02:05:11.392]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:05:11.392 --> 02:05:13.494]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:05:13.994 --> 02:05:20.336]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:05:20.336 --> 02:05:25.518]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:05:25.518 --> 02:05:34.541]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlement and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:05:35.521 --> 02:05:41.507]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[02:05:41.507 --> 02:05:42.448]  It is amazing.
[02:05:42.448 --> 02:05:52.439]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:06:04.394 --> 02:06:09.916]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:09.916 --> 02:06:12.638]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:12.638 --> 02:06:31.026]  So, you have a normal man, just a regular person, not an anointed drag queen story time person, tried to come to the park and ask your kid to sit on their lap and
[02:06:33.124 --> 02:06:36.587]  The man wanted to talk to your six-year-old about how much fun oral sex is.
[02:06:36.587 --> 02:06:43.514]  They'd arrest him for soliciting abuse with a child.
[02:06:43.514 --> 02:06:55.545]  But when it's put in the library as a book of the wonderful experiences of adults who enjoyed men having sex with them when they were little kids, well then it's endorsed by the Library Association.
[02:06:56.718 --> 02:07:19.230]  And if a man in the park wanted to give your child something that looked like it was pretty blue or pretty pink and had Mickey Mouse or Minnie Mouse or a little mermaid on the front of it, and then you found out that this would lower their IQ, give them a 7 to 50 fold increase in bone cancer,
[02:07:20.905 --> 02:07:22.566]  It's exploded off the chart.
[02:07:22.566 --> 02:07:24.227]  And it's in all the studies right here.
[02:07:24.227 --> 02:07:25.728]  And lower their IQ.
[02:07:25.728 --> 02:07:32.592]  Well, if you caught them doing that before the police got there, you beat their ass.
[02:07:32.592 --> 02:07:36.255]  There isn't a grand jury in the country that wouldn't say, no bill.
[02:07:36.255 --> 02:07:42.018]  He may have knocked that guy's teeth out and broke his jawbone.
[02:07:42.018 --> 02:07:45.280]  But that's what you do to somebody soliciting your child.
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:47.942]  Catch him talking to your kid in the back fence about
[02:07:48.942 --> 02:07:51.104]  Hey Junior, pull your pants down.
[02:07:51.104 --> 02:07:52.565]  You're going to like it.
[02:07:52.565 --> 02:07:54.047]  They get their ass kicked.
[02:07:54.047 --> 02:07:59.572]  But oh, when they do it in the school and it's a big old fat man.
[02:07:59.572 --> 02:08:02.455]  Now it's art.
[02:08:02.455 --> 02:08:06.619]  And when they give you that fluoride, that weaponize, you heard the guy calling earlier, he's right.
[02:08:06.619 --> 02:08:08.460]  The stuff they use at the oil refineries.
[02:08:09.707 --> 02:08:14.030]  To break down oil, break down hard oil and to separate it out.
[02:08:14.030 --> 02:08:16.412]  If you get a drop of it on you, it can kill you.
[02:08:16.412 --> 02:08:20.414]  And it's not even as strong as what they put in your water.
[02:08:20.414 --> 02:08:28.600]  When they dump hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water supply in Austin, they put on full body suits and they're about 50 yards away.
[02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:29.561]  We've been there when they do it.
[02:08:29.561 --> 02:08:35.825]  And they turn it and then they run around the corner.
[02:08:35.825 --> 02:08:37.246]  And they're still all gonna die of cancer.
[02:08:42.665 --> 02:08:50.572]  So, remember that they know what they're doing.
[02:08:50.572 --> 02:08:52.874]  And remember, it's a plan.
[02:08:52.874 --> 02:08:56.157]  And it's the people up on top.
[02:08:56.157 --> 02:09:08.888]  100% of the FDA scientists, over a thousand of them, signed petitions twice in the last 30 years, unanimously saying, pull it out of the water.
[02:09:08.888 --> 02:09:09.669]  Didn't do it, did they?
[02:09:11.101 --> 02:09:11.902]  Because there's a plan.
[02:09:11.902 --> 02:09:14.584]  Have you ever heard the lawyers sue over fluoride?
[02:09:14.584 --> 02:09:16.785]  I mean, it's way worse than glyphosate.
[02:09:16.785 --> 02:09:19.488]  Oh, no, no, no!
[02:09:19.488 --> 02:09:22.290]  Because it's not kosher.
[02:09:22.290 --> 02:09:23.591]  It's not acceptable.
[02:09:23.591 --> 02:09:26.733]  It's verboten.
[02:09:26.733 --> 02:09:28.374]  Forbidden.
[02:09:28.374 --> 02:09:30.136]  And it's all this big mind game.
[02:09:30.136 --> 02:09:32.598]  Because you don't want Forbes to write an article about you.
[02:09:33.883 --> 02:09:35.724]  Saying you're an evil, horrible man.
[02:09:35.724 --> 02:09:36.845]  Big cover story.
[02:09:36.845 --> 02:09:38.646]  Alex Jones is evil.
[02:09:38.646 --> 02:09:44.329]  He says fluoride increases cancer and lowers IQ.
[02:09:44.329 --> 02:09:46.790]  Especially in boys.
[02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:50.472]  And blacks.
[02:09:50.472 --> 02:09:53.534]  Because he's a Nazi.
[02:09:53.534 --> 02:09:56.315]  But it was the Nazis put it in the water.
[02:09:56.315 --> 02:09:58.556]  Of the death camps.
[02:09:58.556 --> 02:10:01.018]  Because it made them more docile.
[02:10:02.426 --> 02:10:06.929]  The Nazis gave it to people in the water way stronger than they put it in our water.
[02:10:06.929 --> 02:10:16.916]  They put it in there not even as strong though as is in the candy flavored toothpaste that everyone knows the kids swallow when mommy isn't looking.
[02:10:16.916 --> 02:10:20.119]  And then they get real quiet and just kind of fade out all day.
[02:10:20.119 --> 02:10:27.424]  And they get put in special ed because there's a chemical weapon eating their cerebral cortex.
[02:10:30.228 --> 02:10:44.771]  It's gotta be good to put in the tummy, because the Little Mermaid, who had her voice and her soul stolen, like all those other slaves by the evil witch.
[02:10:44.771 --> 02:10:47.671]  And now she's gonna get your kids.
[02:10:47.671 --> 02:10:50.912]  Just like the pedophiles will use a kid to lure kids to the van.
[02:10:50.912 --> 02:10:53.132]  I've got a puppy, I've got candy.
[02:10:53.132 --> 02:10:56.993]  Come to my van over here.
[02:10:56.993 --> 02:10:58.733]  But instead, it's the Little Mermaid.
[02:11:01.087 --> 02:11:04.168]  Oh, and who else is going to help you get in the van?
[02:11:04.168 --> 02:11:08.128]  Oh, the little Velociraptor.
[02:11:08.128 --> 02:11:11.449]  Or... Mickey.
[02:11:11.449 --> 02:11:14.249]  Mickey Mouse.
[02:11:14.249 --> 02:11:17.010]  Oh, or the Fruit Explosion Toothpaste.
[02:11:17.010 --> 02:11:19.030]  Tell the little primate, oh look, it's fruit.
[02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:20.670]  Eat it.
[02:11:20.670 --> 02:11:25.671]  Looks just like one of your yogurt tubes.
[02:11:25.671 --> 02:11:28.312]  Oh, but Junior can't read, though.
[02:11:28.312 --> 02:11:28.872]  Zoom in, please.
[02:11:29.963 --> 02:11:35.305]  Because on the back, it tells you do not ingest it.
[02:11:35.305 --> 02:11:38.226]  And if you do, call poison control.
[02:11:38.226 --> 02:11:41.246]  Let me put that up on screen for folks.
[02:11:41.246 --> 02:11:42.507]  Type in the toothpaste warning.
[02:11:42.507 --> 02:11:43.487]  I'm going to go to your calls again.
[02:11:43.487 --> 02:11:44.347]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:11:44.347 --> 02:11:49.529]  This is kind of a big deal, because the question is, why is it suddenly being put in the news?
[02:11:49.529 --> 02:11:56.031]  Because they're moving on to 5G.
[02:11:56.031 --> 02:11:56.131]  Oh!
[02:11:57.426 --> 02:11:59.807]  Hydrofluoric acid is a acid.
[02:11:59.807 --> 02:12:02.527]  It's a, it's a amped up molecule.
[02:12:02.527 --> 02:12:04.447]  It's electrical.
[02:12:04.447 --> 02:12:06.908]  They got something better than electrical.
[02:12:06.908 --> 02:12:11.049]  They gonna microwave us with the 5G, baby!
[02:12:11.049 --> 02:12:13.089]  And they admit out of the gates it kills ya!
[02:12:13.089 --> 02:12:17.910]  So everybody get ready to move on upstairs, cause you're gonna be dead!
[02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:20.411]  Boo!
[02:12:20.411 --> 02:12:23.171]  You think you're gonna cut the fluoride out?
[02:12:23.171 --> 02:12:26.512]  We gonna kill yo ass with 5G, baby!
[02:12:29.121 --> 02:12:31.462]  It's a lot of fun dying, isn't it?
[02:12:31.462 --> 02:12:37.804]  Horrible, excruciating deaths and having those big ol' yellow fluoride teeth when they come out of your mouth when you're five years old.
[02:12:37.804 --> 02:12:45.146]  Has mommy been dumping that ATB fluoride baby formula down your throat?
[02:12:45.146 --> 02:12:47.386]  Cause it's the right thing to do!
[02:12:47.386 --> 02:12:50.507]  Cause we're not gonna have four of us make fun of us.
[02:12:50.507 --> 02:12:53.408]  Cowardy butts!
[02:12:53.408 --> 02:12:55.289]  Good, good man from Baylor.
[02:12:55.289 --> 02:12:56.329]  Dated my grandma's son.
[02:12:57.250 --> 02:13:05.796]  Why, the head of H-E-B, the founder of H-E-B, if the government says drink fluoride, the baby gonna drink it!
[02:13:05.796 --> 02:13:08.057]  I say, I say, give that baby!
[02:13:08.057 --> 02:13:10.579]  The eye's dimming now!
[02:13:10.579 --> 02:13:13.560]  Oh, you got a 70 IQ now!
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:18.564]  I give as you a gift!
[02:13:18.564 --> 02:13:21.506]  Say bye-bye, baby!
[02:13:21.506 --> 02:13:25.168]  Let's talk to Eric in California, worked for Water, municipality for 12 years.
[02:13:25.168 --> 02:13:25.928]  Fluoride testimony.
[02:13:25.928 --> 02:13:26.549]  Thanks for calling, sir.
[02:13:27.719 --> 02:13:28.480]  Hey, what's up Alex?
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:29.620]  Long time, first time.
[02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:31.942]  What do you think of the broadcast?
[02:13:31.942 --> 02:13:32.422]  Good, man.
[02:13:32.422 --> 02:13:32.943]  It's good.
[02:13:32.943 --> 02:13:34.063]  It's impactful again.
[02:13:34.063 --> 02:13:35.885]  I just mean, is it on target?
[02:13:35.885 --> 02:13:38.206]  Is somebody that worked in this area?
[02:13:38.206 --> 02:13:43.029]  Yeah, well, when I was 23, man, I started over there as a water operator here in the Bay Area.
[02:13:43.029 --> 02:13:55.298]  Not to get into details, but when I first was part of a project, not a project, but a delivery into our bulk storage tank, the inside of our tank was all, you know, it said poison and
[02:13:56.048 --> 02:13:58.269]  Like you said, skull and crossbones, this and that.
[02:13:58.269 --> 02:14:04.071]  I wasn't familiar with it, so we had to put these Tyvek chem suits on and respirators.
[02:14:04.071 --> 02:14:08.732]  I'm thinking, like, why are we putting all this on for something that we're putting into our water?
[02:14:08.732 --> 02:14:14.294]  So I looked it up a little bit, and my brother was already kind of hip to InfoWars, and he told me about it.
[02:14:14.294 --> 02:14:15.275]  He filled me in a little bit.
[02:14:15.275 --> 02:14:17.816]  I did a little bit more research, and then boom, the light went on.
[02:14:20.076 --> 02:14:32.719]  It came to me and it's like, wow, I'm actually putting this stuff in the water first hand and there was, um, there's these lids on top of our bulk storage tank that are all rusted out.
[02:14:32.719 --> 02:14:41.921]  All the plumbing, we have to go in there and change it out every three to five years because once that stuff gets into the air, it starts eating away at everything.
[02:14:41.921 --> 02:14:47.422]  But I mean, yes, it eats steel and concrete, but your child's brain, oh, that's different.
[02:14:48.755 --> 02:14:55.920]  Yeah, I mean, all the guy who delivered the stuff, his hands were all beat up and mangled.
[02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:59.223]  His suit was just a mess.
[02:14:59.223 --> 02:15:05.247]  And it just goes to show that, you know, a lot of people don't realize what this stuff is.
[02:15:05.247 --> 02:15:07.969]  I even asked a customer one day, I'm like, how do you know about Florida underwater?
[02:15:07.969 --> 02:15:09.230]  Oh, it's the greatest thing.
[02:15:09.230 --> 02:15:09.991]  That's why it's spread.
[02:15:09.991 --> 02:15:13.313]  I said, I would think twice about it and go do some research.
[02:15:13.313 --> 02:15:15.134]  And of course, she lived in the country club.
[02:15:15.134 --> 02:15:15.935]  She didn't know any better.
[02:15:16.587 --> 02:15:19.548]  Because she's in the country club, wow.
[02:15:19.548 --> 02:15:23.889]  We run the country and there's nothing wrong here, just drink it up.
[02:15:23.889 --> 02:15:30.210]  Yeah, well hopefully she came across this article today and she realized the conversation she had with me about five, six years ago.
[02:15:30.210 --> 02:15:31.770]  And she thinks twice about it.
[02:15:31.770 --> 02:15:33.731]  But, hey man, keep doing what you're doing, Alex.
[02:15:33.731 --> 02:15:35.191]  Brother, you keep doing it.
[02:15:35.191 --> 02:15:37.112]  You're just as important as I am, or more.
[02:15:37.112 --> 02:15:38.792]  So don't ever forget that.
[02:15:38.792 --> 02:15:39.252]  I mean that.
[02:15:39.252 --> 02:15:41.112]  You're more important than InfoWars.
[02:15:41.112 --> 02:15:42.353]  Because without you, there's nothing.
[02:15:42.353 --> 02:15:42.993]  Remember that.
[02:15:43.902 --> 02:15:45.945]  By the way, it is true that... Sorry, sir, go ahead.
[02:15:45.945 --> 02:15:50.912]  The first t-shirt I bought was that InfoWars t-shirt, that InfoWars Flow-Rite shirt, the one that has poison in it.
[02:15:50.912 --> 02:15:52.193]  We're gonna bring that shirt back.
[02:15:54.046 --> 02:15:55.327]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:55.327 --> 02:15:56.607]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:56.607 --> 02:16:00.348]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:00.348 --> 02:16:01.429]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:01.429 --> 02:16:03.250]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:03.250 --> 02:16:04.970]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:16:25.091 --> 02:16:29.013]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:29.013 --> 02:16:30.534]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:30.534 --> 02:16:33.515]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:33.515 --> 02:16:39.057]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:02.626]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:17:02.626 --> 02:17:10.990]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:18:54.369 --> 02:19:07.542]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:19:07.542 --> 02:19:10.465]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:19:10.465 --> 02:19:12.227]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:19:12.227 --> 02:19:15.870]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[02:19:16.511 --> 02:19:21.055]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:19:21.055 --> 02:19:22.096]  That's beautiful.
[02:19:22.096 --> 02:19:23.998]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:19:23.998 --> 02:19:25.600]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:33.207]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:19:33.207 --> 02:19:35.529]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:19:35.529 --> 02:19:39.693]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:19:39.693 --> 02:19:40.633]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:19:41.394 --> 02:19:45.535]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:19:45.535 --> 02:19:46.636]  We are the resistance.
[02:19:46.636 --> 02:19:57.739]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[02:19:57.739 --> 02:20:00.420]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:15.375 --> 02:20:27.661]  The New York Times, Forbes, CNN, and hundreds of other publications, literally, it's more than that, have come out to attack me for saying fluoride causes bone cancer, massive reductions in IQ.
[02:20:28.941 --> 02:20:30.782]  And massive decreases in fertility.
[02:20:30.782 --> 02:20:35.004]  It's one of the most studied chemicals in world history.
[02:20:35.004 --> 02:20:42.267]  They've known what it does for 200 years because they had to deal with it in chemical manufacturing production.
[02:20:42.267 --> 02:20:47.590]  The only thing studied more would be something like mercury or lead.
[02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:53.352]  And they knew 200 years ago that people that worked with lead or mercury were mad as hatters.
[02:20:53.352 --> 02:20:57.394]  The guys that made hats would stain it with mercury.
[02:20:59.295 --> 02:20:59.795]  Think about that.
[02:20:59.795 --> 02:21:01.036]  Your calls are coming up next segment.
[02:21:01.036 --> 02:21:02.616]  Joey Gibson's been kind enough to join us.
[02:21:02.616 --> 02:21:06.518]  He's the founder of the Patriot Prayer March.
[02:21:06.518 --> 02:21:09.599]  He just saw a bunch of bullies three years ago beating up men, women, and children.
[02:21:09.599 --> 02:21:12.040]  They tried to have gun rallies, property rights rallies.
[02:21:12.040 --> 02:21:17.282]  Antifa would show up all over the Pacific Northwest, down to California.
[02:21:18.496 --> 02:21:24.337]  And famously, Pelosi was out there supporting them in San Francisco and they attacked even their own crowds.
[02:21:24.337 --> 02:21:25.858]  Even the liberals that came out got attacked by them.
[02:21:25.858 --> 02:21:28.638]  They're such meth-head scum.
[02:21:28.638 --> 02:21:33.619]  Well, now we've seen them attack children, attack people with hammers, and even AP.
[02:21:33.619 --> 02:21:34.779]  I've got the headline here somewhere.
[02:21:34.779 --> 02:21:36.780]  I showed it yesterday.
[02:21:36.780 --> 02:21:45.962]  Admitted that the Patriots were peaceful and that the Antifa was violent even after the Proud Boys left.
[02:21:45.962 --> 02:21:46.822]  But Joey Gibson
[02:21:51.755 --> 02:21:56.376]  Joey Gibson, he got arrested.
[02:21:56.376 --> 02:22:00.777]  He got arrested for being there months before and simply doing nothing.
[02:22:00.777 --> 02:22:04.858]  They said inciting a riot because when Antifa was threatening him, he stood his ground.
[02:22:04.858 --> 02:22:07.218]  Remember what Chris Cuomo said?
[02:22:07.218 --> 02:22:11.819]  He said, the Covington kids are bad because they stood their ground.
[02:22:11.819 --> 02:22:20.781]  When a man came over with people yelling that they were going to kill them and genocide them because they were white and beating a drum in their face when they were just there to pick up a bus, get on a bus.
[02:22:22.955 --> 02:22:34.882]  So the mob surrounds our guests, Joey Gibson, and now they're trying to put him in jail.
[02:22:34.882 --> 02:22:44.228]  And it's the perfect time to have him on because Proud Boys, Maxwell Hare and John Kingsman, we already showed the footage the first hour when Gavin McGinnis joined us, founder of the Proud Boys.
[02:22:45.831 --> 02:22:47.172]  They follow them out of their event.
[02:22:47.172 --> 02:22:49.493]  The police escort in, just like Antifa always does.
[02:22:49.493 --> 02:22:51.655]  They try to attack them near their cars.
[02:22:51.655 --> 02:22:53.436]  They simply fight back.
[02:22:53.436 --> 02:22:55.617]  It's a 15 second scrap.
[02:22:55.617 --> 02:22:57.899]  On a scale of 1 to 10, it's like a 2.
[02:22:57.899 --> 02:23:02.962]  Nobody got their teeth knocked out.
[02:23:02.962 --> 02:23:04.443]  And they're facing 15 years.
[02:23:04.443 --> 02:23:08.065]  One of them is already on Rikers Island, where they hold
[02:23:10.728 --> 02:23:12.990]  People from the Mafia.
[02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:13.730]  Hitmen.
[02:23:13.730 --> 02:23:16.712]  So, this is the new crime.
[02:23:16.712 --> 02:23:24.017]  Joey Gibson, strange days my friend, but congratulations on keeping your chin up and you guys not being violent in the face of those pigs.
[02:23:26.178 --> 02:23:29.362]  Yeah, the organizers, Joe Biggs and Rickey, did a really good job.
[02:23:29.362 --> 02:23:30.604]  I'm really impressed.
[02:23:30.604 --> 02:23:32.766]  They were committed to avoiding the violence.
[02:23:32.766 --> 02:23:36.011]  They understood that the media is going to use that against us.
[02:23:36.011 --> 02:23:38.434]  Shoot, they probably arrested a bunch of people for defending themselves.
[02:23:38.434 --> 02:23:41.357]  You know, I got arrested for not even being violent.
[02:23:41.357 --> 02:23:42.459]  You know, standing on the sidewalk.
[02:23:42.975 --> 02:23:43.996]  And getting pepper sprayed.
[02:23:43.996 --> 02:23:45.278]  I mean, talk about civil rights.
[02:23:45.278 --> 02:23:50.685]  Like, you know, people have been kind of, you know, haven't really been paying attention to Antifa that much.
[02:23:50.685 --> 02:23:55.190]  They like watching the videos, but they think it's just a bunch of gangs fighting in the streets, so people don't pay attention to it.
[02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:57.493]  But now, you know, they should really wake people up.
[02:23:57.493 --> 02:23:59.796]  Especially what you're talking about with the two Proud Boys in New York.
[02:23:59.796 --> 02:24:00.677]  They didn't do anything wrong.
[02:24:00.677 --> 02:24:01.879]  We shouldn't be sending these people to prison.
[02:24:02.638 --> 02:24:08.920]  Um, it's very important to understand that Antifa is allowed to go on the streets with batons, like literally with no masks on, right?
[02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:12.461]  So you can identify them, take it to the cars, right?
[02:24:12.461 --> 02:24:18.763]  Uh, block traffic, like literally start riots and they don't charge them at all, ever.
[02:24:18.763 --> 02:24:25.925]  And you look at them attacking people with hammers, blooding people inside vehicles, doing all this, you guys don't even fight back.
[02:24:25.925 --> 02:24:27.905]  And a lot of the media said that you were the bad guys.
[02:24:27.905 --> 02:24:30.246]  AP actually got it right, which was pretty, pretty amazing.
[02:24:32.611 --> 02:24:40.977]  So when you read through the headlines, most of them say, uh, uh, Proud Boys clash with Antifa or Far Left clashes with Far Right and everything.
[02:24:40.977 --> 02:24:42.998]  But, you know, they don't have any film to show.
[02:24:42.998 --> 02:24:49.522]  All they show is Antifa fighting with the police or Antifa beating on a random guy and his daughter, right?
[02:24:49.522 --> 02:24:51.824]  So they're really trying to manipulate things.
[02:24:51.824 --> 02:24:56.667]  And I know that you talk about this, but it's important for people to understand that this is like exactly what China does.
[02:24:56.667 --> 02:24:58.468]  You know, they manipulate the culture.
[02:24:58.468 --> 02:25:01.390]  They just repeat it over and over and over again until people believe it.
[02:25:01.966 --> 02:25:04.487]  People believe that I'm some far-right extremist.
[02:25:04.487 --> 02:25:06.308]  They believe that I'm racist.
[02:25:06.308 --> 02:25:08.048]  And they believe that I have hate speech.
[02:25:08.048 --> 02:25:10.589]  But they can't find one piece of evidence.
[02:25:10.589 --> 02:25:11.669]  This is the world we live in.
[02:25:11.669 --> 02:25:13.130]  And I know you understand, Alex.
[02:25:13.130 --> 02:25:14.290]  You've got to deal with it more than anybody.
[02:25:14.290 --> 02:25:16.791]  But, you know, I just wish people would do the research.
[02:25:16.791 --> 02:25:17.351]  Open your eyes.
[02:25:17.351 --> 02:25:18.772]  Let's pull people out of the Matrix.
[02:25:18.772 --> 02:25:19.752]  Come on, now.
[02:25:19.752 --> 02:25:21.753]  Like, let's go wake up, United States.
[02:25:21.753 --> 02:25:24.574]  Like, this is our freedom that is under attack.
[02:25:24.574 --> 02:25:27.395]  And all you can think about is that everything is racist.
[02:25:27.395 --> 02:25:27.675]  That's it.
[02:25:29.223 --> 02:25:29.544]  That's it.
[02:25:47.996 --> 02:25:52.340]  I mean, this is just, imagine if a Republican or a Proud Boy was doing this to somebody.
[02:25:52.340 --> 02:25:59.607]  A huge horde of white meth heads, and I'm just, because everybody's racist, it's almost all white people, chasing down a white guy and his daughter.
[02:25:59.607 --> 02:26:02.549]  I mean, if Radio Lizards can't see this, it's on Infowars.com.
[02:26:02.549 --> 02:26:03.250]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:26:05.086 --> 02:26:05.727]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:05.727 --> 02:26:07.268]  And this is what I tell reporters all the time.
[02:26:07.268 --> 02:26:10.892]  I said, because everyone keeps talking about the white supremacist movement, the white nationalist movement.
[02:26:10.892 --> 02:26:20.741]  And I say, listen, if there was a thousand white supremacists running through the streets, beating up people on the left because of their speech, like I would be there to stand up for the Democrats.
[02:26:20.741 --> 02:26:22.683]  I would be there to stand up for the liberals.
[02:26:22.683 --> 02:26:26.447]  I don't understand why it's so hard for the left to disavow Antifa.
[02:26:26.867 --> 02:26:30.992]  Like, are you that afraid or do you just believe that their behavior is okay?
[02:26:30.992 --> 02:26:35.617]  Because these guys are literally acting like how racists treated black people back in the day.
[02:26:35.617 --> 02:26:36.799]  Like, it's identical.
[02:26:36.799 --> 02:26:39.141]  They're acting like how Nazis want to treat Jews.
[02:26:39.141 --> 02:26:42.946]  So, it's just amazing that everything they say they're against, but that's how they're acting.
[02:26:43.942 --> 02:26:46.063]  It's like that, what was that show?
[02:26:46.063 --> 02:26:49.544]  I think it was an MTV show back when they still had some good shows, a comedy.
[02:26:49.544 --> 02:26:55.587]  And it's the Nazis sitting around going, we're in black uniforms, we have skulls on, maybe we're the baddies.
[02:26:55.587 --> 02:27:02.709]  And if you look at them, they are so bad and so villainous, and so cowardly attacking women, children, people in wheelchairs.
[02:27:02.709 --> 02:27:07.892]  I notice they don't ever want to attack big guys like you, unless they have like a club or something, they still get their ass kicked.
[02:27:07.892 --> 02:27:11.413]  But they target women and children, or like a little gay Asian dude.
[02:27:13.399 --> 02:27:14.620]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:24.225]  And they love to target minorities because I have a guy that goes down to school down in one of the two-year universities in the Bay Area by UC Berkeley.
[02:27:24.225 --> 02:27:28.488]  That's where the professor who used the bike lock, that's where he taught.
[02:27:28.488 --> 02:27:33.471]  This kid that came out of school said they kicked him out for so-called racism even though he's Indian.
[02:27:33.471 --> 02:27:37.093]  He said they specifically target conservatives who are of color.
[02:27:37.685 --> 02:27:38.905]  So they're literally racist.
[02:27:38.905 --> 02:27:43.007]  Like, they're literally trying to find people of color or people who are gay.
[02:27:43.007 --> 02:27:45.127]  Yeah, they're bullying and telling people what they can do.
[02:27:45.127 --> 02:27:51.469]  And there's also footage of white guys calling black guys racial terms because they're cops.
[02:27:51.469 --> 02:27:53.850]  I mean, they don't even believe in borders, police anything.
[02:27:53.850 --> 02:27:55.130]  Of course they do.
[02:27:55.130 --> 02:27:56.551]  They want full control.
[02:27:56.551 --> 02:27:57.751]  Let's play this audio as we go to break.
[02:27:57.751 --> 02:27:57.991]  Here it is.
[02:28:02.043 --> 02:28:05.166]  They're calling him all sorts of names.
[02:28:24.892 --> 02:28:26.072]  They're truly the scum of the earth.
[02:28:26.072 --> 02:28:26.753]  Joey, we're going to break.
[02:28:26.753 --> 02:28:32.715]  We'll come back and take some calls with you on a whole subject, a whole bunch of subjects, but one word to define Antifa.
[02:28:32.715 --> 02:28:34.596]  I want to get your take on that when we come back.
[02:28:34.596 --> 02:28:36.416]  Patriot-Prayer.com.
[02:28:36.416 --> 02:28:37.477]  Joey gives us our guest.
[02:28:37.477 --> 02:28:40.518]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWorks.com, InfoWorks.com.
[02:28:40.518 --> 02:28:42.979]  If you don't share these links, nobody will.
[02:28:42.979 --> 02:28:44.339]  It's not just on my shoulders.
[02:28:44.339 --> 02:28:45.319]  I'm just telling you.
[02:28:45.319 --> 02:28:46.880]  You are the resistance.
[02:28:46.880 --> 02:28:48.581]  You are everything.
[02:28:48.581 --> 02:28:50.221]  And if you don't take action, we're going to lose.
[02:28:50.221 --> 02:28:52.182]  If you take action, we're unstoppable.
[02:28:53.760 --> 02:28:58.323]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:58.323 --> 02:29:00.404]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:00.404 --> 02:29:02.145]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:02.145 --> 02:29:08.709]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:08.709 --> 02:29:13.772]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:13.772 --> 02:29:18.475]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:18.915 --> 02:29:22.016]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:22.016 --> 02:29:29.039]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:29.039 --> 02:29:34.222]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:34.222 --> 02:29:37.523]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:37.523 --> 02:29:38.463]  Get clean.
[02:29:38.463 --> 02:29:40.304]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:40.304 --> 02:29:40.344]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:44.326 --> 02:29:44.807]  800-506-6740 That's 800-506-6740
[02:29:54.622 --> 02:30:07.795]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[02:30:07.795 --> 02:30:10.718]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:30:10.718 --> 02:30:12.480]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:30:12.480 --> 02:30:16.123]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[02:30:16.764 --> 02:30:21.308]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:30:21.308 --> 02:30:22.349]  That's beautiful.
[02:30:22.349 --> 02:30:24.251]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:30:24.251 --> 02:30:25.853]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:30:25.853 --> 02:30:33.460]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:35.782]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:30:35.782 --> 02:30:39.966]  And the human spirit lives at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[02:30:39.966 --> 02:30:40.906]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:30:41.667 --> 02:30:45.790]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:30:45.790 --> 02:30:46.650]  We are the resistance.
[02:30:46.650 --> 02:30:47.531]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[02:30:54.838 --> 02:31:06.065]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists are backed into a corner, and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[02:31:06.065 --> 02:31:10.187]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[02:31:10.187 --> 02:31:19.553]  The world is going to change, and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[02:31:20.293 --> 02:31:22.315]  The system is vulnerable.
[02:31:22.315 --> 02:31:24.998]  Electricity could be gone in an instant.
[02:31:24.998 --> 02:31:28.641]  And grocery stores could be empty in three days.
[02:31:28.641 --> 02:31:35.548]  Having storable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance in the next level.
[02:31:35.548 --> 02:31:40.874]  And being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave to a dying system.

[02:31:55.273 --> 02:31:58.555]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[02:31:58.555 --> 02:32:00.816]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[02:32:00.816 --> 02:32:02.156]  This is reality.
[02:32:02.156 --> 02:32:03.117]  And I'll say this.
[02:32:03.117 --> 02:32:04.217]  It's all of our birthright.
[02:32:04.217 --> 02:32:06.298]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight.
[02:32:06.298 --> 02:32:08.379]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[02:32:08.379 --> 02:32:09.860]  We're seeing election meddling.
[02:32:09.860 --> 02:32:13.862]  And it's time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor power grab.
[02:32:13.862 --> 02:32:16.323]  They didn't come like an enemy from over the horizon.
[02:32:16.323 --> 02:32:17.664]  They came from inside.
[02:32:17.664 --> 02:32:19.345]  And they came through cyberspace.
[02:32:19.345 --> 02:32:20.065]  Our Republic.
[02:32:20.305 --> 02:32:23.126]  Our constitutional little d democracy has been hacked.
[02:32:23.126 --> 02:32:29.267]  And please remember, without your financial support, we wouldn't have withstood this withering storm of censorship, attacks, and lies.
[02:32:29.267 --> 02:32:34.728]  We have the new World Awakens Mega Sale Globalist House of Cards Collapsing End of Summer Super Sale.
[02:32:34.728 --> 02:32:41.630]  It's the big, giant, 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double pay for your points, but only on 50-something items, not
[02:32:41.830 --> 02:32:42.991]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:16.222 --> 02:33:19.828]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[02:33:19.828 --> 02:33:21.491]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:47.483 --> 02:33:47.703]  We're good.
[02:34:11.178 --> 02:34:18.902]  Recently, President Trump launched a new offensive against progressives by drawing attention to the decrepit state of major leftist-run cities.
[02:34:18.902 --> 02:34:20.623]  Wonder where he got that idea from?
[02:34:20.623 --> 02:34:22.324]  But forget about Baltimore.
[02:34:22.324 --> 02:34:24.726]  If Baltimore was a toilet, L.A.
[02:34:24.726 --> 02:34:26.867]  would be a 500-acre landfill.
[02:34:26.867 --> 02:34:27.147]  L.A.
[02:34:27.147 --> 02:34:31.329]  can truly lay claim to the accolade of being king of the s**tholes.
[02:34:31.329 --> 02:34:36.132]  There are now an estimated 60,000 homeless people living on the streets of L.A.
[02:34:36.132 --> 02:34:38.033]  That's a 75% rise in homelessness since 2012.
[02:34:40.134 --> 02:34:42.035]  Did you ever see, uh, I Am Legend?
[02:34:42.035 --> 02:34:42.355]  Yes.
[02:34:42.355 --> 02:34:42.595]  Okay.
[02:34:42.595 --> 02:34:45.697]  Remember when all the f***ing crazy zombie people were running at once?
[02:34:45.697 --> 02:34:46.037]  Yeah.
[02:34:46.037 --> 02:34:46.617]  That's what it's like.
[02:34:46.617 --> 02:34:47.538]  Are you serious?
[02:34:47.538 --> 02:34:49.539]  I'm telling you, you can't believe the volume.
[02:34:49.539 --> 02:34:56.222]  To illustrate the homeless problem, look at this comparison between 2015 and 2017.
[02:34:56.222 --> 02:35:01.805]  Look at the increase in trash and tents in a period of little over two years.
[02:35:01.805 --> 02:35:03.666]  And what's the mayor's solution?
[02:35:03.666 --> 02:35:05.727]  To paint murals of homeless people.
[02:35:05.727 --> 02:35:08.508]  Because painting a mural of people who can't afford to...
[02:35:11.968 --> 02:35:13.623]  I stepped on my headset cord.
[02:35:14.779 --> 02:35:16.780]  And broke it so I had to find a new one.
[02:35:16.780 --> 02:35:22.184]  I'm sorry we're getting back late here, but that's part of Paul's LA is a you-know-what hole.
[02:35:22.184 --> 02:35:27.167]  And why is every area run by Democrats either collapsing or in a stage of collapse?
[02:35:27.167 --> 02:35:28.268]  Austin used to be awesome.
[02:35:28.268 --> 02:35:32.891]  Now it resembles a toilet bowl in many areas and crimes going up.
[02:35:32.891 --> 02:35:41.597]  We're gonna go to calls here in a moment with Joey Gibson, who again marches all over the West Coast mainly, but he's also gone and covered what's happening in Hong Kong.
[02:35:41.597 --> 02:35:44.559]  Why do you think everywhere they're in control degenerates so fast?
[02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:52.680]  One of the things too is, you know, the big government is about bringing as much money as you can, right?
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:59.021]  So they convince the folks to bring in a bunch of taxes, but then they don't want to use that money to go clean up the streets and clean up their problems, right?
[02:35:59.021 --> 02:36:02.102]  They want to use that money to go to special contracts or wherever that money goes.
[02:36:02.102 --> 02:36:07.903]  I always tell people this, that, you know, they go up on that grandstand and say, hey, we need raises for teachers, right?
[02:36:07.903 --> 02:36:13.964]  So they increase taxes and like 5% of it goes to the teachers, 95% of it disappears to a bunch of different, you know, special interests.
[02:36:16.368 --> 02:36:21.352]  How bad do you think it's going to get, and when do you think Trump is going to declare them a terrorist organization?
[02:36:21.352 --> 02:36:31.882]  Because I'm all for free speech, but when you organize and say your mission is to stop other people's speech using violence and to make them politically submit to you, that's the textbook definition of terrorism.
[02:36:33.317 --> 02:36:49.328]  As soon as he gets evidence that there's money coming in from outside the country, as soon as he gets evidence that certain organizations like CARE that work hand-in-hand with Antifa, as soon as he gets evidence that the Chinese are involved in this, I think that that's when he can push really hard on it.
[02:36:49.328 --> 02:36:54.672]  Because we literally have outside forces of this country that are funding and pushing this division in our country.
[02:36:55.052 --> 02:36:56.233]  Especially with the media.
[02:36:56.233 --> 02:36:58.875]  The media is not owned by this country, alright?
[02:36:58.875 --> 02:37:00.316]  Let's make that very clear.
[02:37:00.316 --> 02:37:05.720]  And the media overwhelmingly supports Antifa or is completely silent on their behavior.
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:06.440]  Right?
[02:37:06.440 --> 02:37:09.823]  It's just unbelievable how much they justify their behavior.
[02:37:09.823 --> 02:37:20.070]  Just like that lady who went on national television on CNN and was saying that Trump sided with the Nazis instead of siding with the peaceful protesters, which she was referring to Antifa.
[02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:22.192]  So, like you said, it's clown world.
[02:37:22.904 --> 02:37:24.005]  I do it over and over again.
[02:37:24.005 --> 02:37:28.488]  I want to get you back on later this week to give us your take on Hong Kong.
[02:37:28.488 --> 02:37:34.911]  We're going to have some reporters that I'm talking to over in Hong Kong that are going to be popping in because the word is that is heating up very, very quickly.
[02:37:34.911 --> 02:37:39.855]  I've been talking to some of the British connected folks in the government.
[02:37:39.855 --> 02:37:42.196]  You know, there's obviously a couple different factions over there.
[02:37:42.196 --> 02:37:44.437]  We're going to be looking at that very, very soon.
[02:37:44.437 --> 02:37:48.100]  Joey Gibson, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:48.360]  Thank you.
[02:37:49.059 --> 02:37:50.140]  All right, there goes Joey Gibson.
[02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:52.602]  I promised to get to your calls, so I appreciate you holding.
[02:37:52.602 --> 02:38:00.028]  We're going to get to everybody now before this hour ends, or we're going to go to the next hour to take care of it.
[02:38:00.028 --> 02:38:02.129]  But Mike Adams is loaded for bear, as always.
[02:38:02.129 --> 02:38:07.353]  There's a lot of other news I haven't hit yet that I also want to try to cram in with Mike, so I'll probably just co-host with him.
[02:38:07.353 --> 02:38:14.038]  Some know I have a dental appointment today.
[02:38:14.038 --> 02:38:16.941]  NPR reported that all my teeth were knocked out when I was a teenager.
[02:38:17.844 --> 02:38:23.046]  Because I was tied up by children I bullied and taken to a field and all my teeth were knocked out.
[02:38:23.046 --> 02:38:28.108]  I just always love that I'm offered to go have my teeth looked at that I've never had a tooth knocked out.
[02:38:28.108 --> 02:38:32.910]  And they did not do it because they're a pack of criminal liars.
[02:38:32.910 --> 02:38:38.993]  And again, then they run with that in hundreds of articles about my ethos that I'm a bully.
[02:38:38.993 --> 02:38:44.475]  No, you the left are a bunch of pedophile backing, Islamic backing scum.
[02:38:47.122 --> 02:38:47.642]  Unbelievable.
[02:38:47.642 --> 02:38:50.845]  And you always want to get into countries that have some semblance of freedom.
[02:38:50.845 --> 02:39:01.793]  Because next time, I'm going to play a clip of it, Tlaib crying and saying, my grandmother couldn't get into Israel for health care.
[02:39:01.793 --> 02:39:04.155]  She's not an Israeli citizen.
[02:39:04.155 --> 02:39:06.196]  But Tlaib says, we need open borders.
[02:39:06.196 --> 02:39:06.897]  Everyone come here.
[02:39:06.897 --> 02:39:08.438]  Free stuff.
[02:39:08.438 --> 02:39:10.640]  But you can't come to that fat ass's house.
[02:39:11.607 --> 02:39:12.868]  And ask her to give you some money.
[02:39:12.868 --> 02:39:13.468]  She won't.
[02:39:13.468 --> 02:39:18.452]  It's like Maxine Waters buys a book from a homeless woman who's trying to help Skid Row.
[02:39:18.452 --> 02:39:21.814]  Acts like she's done a good job and smiles like she's this good, great person.
[02:39:21.814 --> 02:39:23.235]  She's a sociopath.
[02:39:23.235 --> 02:39:24.336]  Probably a psychopath.
[02:39:24.336 --> 02:39:25.757]  Doesn't know how dumb it looks.
[02:39:25.757 --> 02:39:28.198]  And then goes, I need change for my 20!
[02:39:28.198 --> 02:39:29.939]  I need $10!
[02:39:29.939 --> 02:39:32.281]  You should have given her the whole 20, you stupid witch!
[02:39:32.281 --> 02:39:34.903]  Or said, I'm going to take you to Congress for a tour.
[02:39:34.903 --> 02:39:38.685]  We're going to promote what you're doing and try to get some private citizens there to help.
[02:39:38.685 --> 02:39:39.506]  But no, instead she just
[02:39:40.066 --> 02:39:41.847]  I'm helping everybody, we're going to play that next hour.
[02:39:58.851 --> 02:40:00.211]  The type of nutcases we're dealing with.
[02:40:00.211 --> 02:40:05.992]  I mean, I couldn't imagine talking to a woman trying to pull the homeless out and publish her own book and slipping on the street.
[02:40:05.992 --> 02:40:15.934]  She's trying to provide tents for people and mental health with the money she made off a book and Maxine Waters wouldn't give her $20 for it and smiles and goes, look how good I am.
[02:40:15.934 --> 02:40:16.894]  I'm helping.
[02:40:16.894 --> 02:40:17.254]  Yeah.
[02:40:17.254 --> 02:40:20.615]  How many, what's your husband's still 30 million was it?
[02:40:20.615 --> 02:40:25.116]  And two different swindles, a taxpayer money right to his own damn bank.
[02:40:25.116 --> 02:40:26.636]  But look, I'm going to give this lady $10.
[02:40:29.238 --> 02:40:31.539]  I'm so nice.
[02:40:31.539 --> 02:40:35.079]  What a freakazoid, man.
[02:40:35.079 --> 02:40:38.380]  Fake is a $3 bill.
[02:40:38.380 --> 02:40:40.781]  Okay, back to the Coles, my friends.
[02:40:40.781 --> 02:40:42.521]  I just ranted a whole other segment, didn't I?
[02:40:42.521 --> 02:40:48.303]  Oh no, Joey was on with us.
[02:40:48.303 --> 02:40:48.723]  Who should we go to?
[02:40:48.723 --> 02:40:53.584]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[02:40:53.584 --> 02:40:54.804]  Jefferson's been holding the longest.
[02:40:54.804 --> 02:40:56.145]  Jefferson and Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:40:56.145 --> 02:40:56.705]  Thank you, go ahead.
[02:40:58.356 --> 02:40:59.780]  Thank you for letting me on, Alex.
[02:40:59.780 --> 02:41:01.124]  Thank you for calling, are you kidding?
[02:41:02.921 --> 02:41:09.246]  Joey Gibson and the Proud Boys are in a bind because they get over-prosecuted for simply protecting themselves.
[02:41:09.246 --> 02:41:10.467]  The President and A.G.
[02:41:10.467 --> 02:41:12.028]  Barr need to step in on this.
[02:41:12.028 --> 02:41:17.092]  This is ridiculous that these people get charged and sometimes convicted of things they didn't even really do.
[02:41:17.092 --> 02:41:17.473]  Exactly.
[02:41:17.473 --> 02:41:24.078]  We need the FBI to go for an indictment of the day-long threats and harassment for two days that stopped them at a bunch of venues.
[02:41:24.078 --> 02:41:31.344]  They finally get a venue, they come and promise to kill the cops, attack them, then the cops have to leave them alone, and then they get attacked and then they go to jail.
[02:41:33.365 --> 02:41:34.247]  Yeah, it's gotten nuts.
[02:41:34.247 --> 02:41:42.325]  I mean, I'm no fan of what happened in Charlottesville, but that guy James Field, he got convicted of first-degree murder, like he planned to kill Heather Heyer.
[02:41:42.325 --> 02:41:43.207]  Yeah, premeditated.
[02:41:44.676 --> 02:41:45.136]  Right.
[02:41:45.136 --> 02:41:46.017]  That's ridiculous.
[02:41:46.017 --> 02:41:48.979]  No, he freaked out with them beating on the car and then she had a heart attack and died.
[02:41:48.979 --> 02:41:49.840]  It's very sad.
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.663]  Then they sued me saying I said that the cameraman killed her.
[02:41:53.663 --> 02:41:57.205]  No, I said the left came in with all their people to clash with this.
[02:41:57.205 --> 02:41:59.127]  A lot of those Nazis were staged.
[02:41:59.127 --> 02:42:03.230]  That's come out to create a melee, hoping something bad happened.
[02:42:03.230 --> 02:42:09.535]  But then they're like in court going, Jones says this man himself killed the... I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:42:10.967 --> 02:42:12.468]  And it's all this racism thing.
[02:42:12.468 --> 02:42:14.290]  Same reason they put the Proud Boys in jail.
[02:42:14.290 --> 02:42:16.592]  15 years, Rikers Island's what they're facing.
[02:42:16.592 --> 02:42:19.355]  Because they told the jury, they're a KKK group.
[02:42:19.355 --> 02:42:20.837]  And the jury went, oooh.
[02:42:20.837 --> 02:42:23.779]  And didn't even care that they showed it wasn't true.
[02:42:23.779 --> 02:42:26.622]  They wanted to prove they weren't Nazis.
[02:42:26.622 --> 02:42:29.625]  So it's the same thing with this judge in Virginia.
[02:42:29.625 --> 02:42:33.289]  I mean, literally, they just go in there and they say, Jones says that, uh...
[02:42:34.246 --> 02:42:37.970]  That the same people at this event did the stuff in Ukraine.
[02:42:37.970 --> 02:42:39.411]  We didn't say that.
[02:42:39.411 --> 02:42:42.614]  We say Soros funded both groups, which he did!
[02:42:42.614 --> 02:42:44.035]  Stay there, I'm gonna come right back to you.
[02:42:44.035 --> 02:42:45.317]  Don't hang up Jefferson.
[02:42:45.317 --> 02:42:46.758]  Everybody else's calls coming up!
[02:42:53.621 --> 02:43:06.791]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[02:43:06.791 --> 02:43:09.713]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[02:43:09.713 --> 02:43:11.474]  farming goods a week ago.
[02:43:11.474 --> 02:43:15.117]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[02:43:15.757 --> 02:43:20.319]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[02:43:20.319 --> 02:43:21.359]  That's beautiful.
[02:43:21.359 --> 02:43:23.240]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[02:43:23.240 --> 02:43:24.860]  And we aren't going to back down.
[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:32.443]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[02:43:32.443 --> 02:43:34.764]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[02:43:34.764 --> 02:43:38.945]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:43:38.945 --> 02:43:39.866]  And I'm asking listeners,
[02:43:40.666 --> 02:43:44.793]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[02:43:44.793 --> 02:43:45.895]  We are the resistance.
[02:43:45.895 --> 02:43:46.616]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:44:00.262]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[02:45:00.819 --> 02:45:04.860]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:45:04.860 --> 02:45:06.300]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:45:06.300 --> 02:45:13.582]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[02:45:13.582 --> 02:45:16.623]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[02:45:16.623 --> 02:45:17.763]  It's a form of fascism.
[02:45:18.695 --> 02:45:22.458]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[02:45:22.458 --> 02:45:33.787]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[02:45:33.787 --> 02:45:45.416]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[02:45:45.416 --> 02:45:46.637]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:45:49.326 --> 02:45:51.350]  You can't watch this, the movie.
[02:45:51.350 --> 02:46:00.185]  Available now at InfoWarsStore.com Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[02:46:01.488 --> 02:46:10.896]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:46:10.896 --> 02:46:22.546]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:46:22.546 --> 02:46:26.730]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.

[02:46:58.251 --> 02:47:00.861]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:36.977 --> 02:47:39.998]  I'll have one of your phone calls here in just a moment.
[02:47:39.998 --> 02:47:55.325]  Since I mentioned Maxine Waters, it's one thing to hear me talk about her at Skid Row, but if you're a TV viewer, radio listeners will hear her voice, but if you see her, you just really pick up on she's so proud just like she won the blue ribbon.
[02:47:55.325 --> 02:47:56.566]  She's such a good person.
[02:47:57.435 --> 02:48:09.997]  And she's doing this good deed, even though it's the blue cities where the people are doing so bad and where they set it up to bring in people and to cater to the drug addicts and all of it, to create as big an eyesore as they can to get more funding.
[02:48:09.997 --> 02:48:20.439]  She knows damn well what she's doing, and she's such a greedy monster that swindles taxpayers for decades, hundreds of millions of dollars, her husband 30 plus million in two different scams, that they admit.
[02:48:20.439 --> 02:48:22.820]  But because she's black, they don't dare indict her.
[02:48:24.172 --> 02:48:25.833]  It's incredible how the left operates.
[02:48:25.833 --> 02:48:28.854]  So here she is on Skid Row.
[02:48:28.854 --> 02:48:33.515]  Let me tell you, the camera cannot pick up how disgusting Skid Row is and how out of control it is.
[02:48:33.515 --> 02:48:39.437]  And the drug dealers openly flipping the cops off 150 yards from the police station.
[02:48:39.437 --> 02:48:40.438]  That's where it's at.
[02:48:40.438 --> 02:48:42.538]  And now we're getting Skid Rows in Austin.
[02:48:42.538 --> 02:48:46.540]  They're legal anywhere and everywhere, including your front yard, but not at city council.
[02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:51.321]  Just like the EU exempts its own bureaucrats from EU taxes.
[02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:54.102]  Yes, you can't make that up.
[02:48:54.102 --> 02:48:56.403]  These people are incredible.
[02:48:56.403 --> 02:48:58.583]  So here's Maxine Waters.
[02:48:58.583 --> 02:49:04.205]  Okay, I'm Maxine Waters, and I'm here, and I'm with Stephanie Arnold-Williams.
[02:49:04.205 --> 02:49:06.246]  Stephanie Arnold-Williams.
[02:49:06.246 --> 02:49:07.306]  And she's so creative.
[02:49:07.306 --> 02:49:09.707]  She set up a really nice environment here.
[02:49:09.707 --> 02:49:12.388]  But she's got all these educational books, and guess what?
[02:49:12.388 --> 02:49:14.709]  I just bought the book on Langston Hughes for $10.
[02:49:14.709 --> 02:49:15.529]  I need change.
[02:49:16.920 --> 02:49:17.240]  I need 10!
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:21.581]  By the way, I need a lot more than $10 and we're going to go to your calls.
[02:49:21.581 --> 02:49:25.062]  I'm going to explain this.
[02:49:25.062 --> 02:49:29.083]  I can run this place for a year.
[02:49:29.083 --> 02:49:30.304]  But that's a year.
[02:49:30.304 --> 02:49:36.045]  If I don't order more product, I can run us for a year at our current operations and maybe even expand some.
[02:49:36.045 --> 02:49:37.366]  But 10 in a year
[02:49:38.713 --> 02:49:42.335]  We'll have to shut this place down and I'll still reach everybody and it'll be big.
[02:49:42.335 --> 02:49:45.097]  It's just that it'll be a crew of 10 people on a crew of 50.
[02:49:45.097 --> 02:49:54.162]  We do a lot of stuff behind the scenes, a lot of stuff you don't know about, a lot of things that, a lot of projects we funded over the years and I really can't even do that anymore.
[02:49:54.162 --> 02:49:56.484]  But we can see our projects doing very well.
[02:49:56.484 --> 02:49:58.185]  Some projects I funded 100%, some projects I funded 30%.
[02:50:01.245 --> 02:50:02.287]  We've done a lot.
[02:50:02.287 --> 02:50:09.724]  And I wish back in the day, before they cut us off so many places, that they'd taken all our sponsors away with all the harassment, that I'd made more money and shorted up.
[02:50:09.724 --> 02:50:10.024]  I didn't.
[02:50:12.209 --> 02:50:15.170]  And so, again, we've got David Knight in the morning doing a great job.
[02:50:15.170 --> 02:50:17.191]  You've got my broadcast you're watching and listening to.
[02:50:17.191 --> 02:50:18.331]  We've got The War Room.
[02:50:18.331 --> 02:50:20.151]  We've got a couple of new shows starting in September.
[02:50:20.151 --> 02:50:22.152]  I'm not going to announce those yet.
[02:50:22.152 --> 02:50:24.153]  But there it all is.
[02:50:24.153 --> 02:50:27.634]  And word of mouth, your prayer and your financial support.
[02:50:27.634 --> 02:50:29.894]  They're all admitting that the water's full of deadly poisons.
[02:50:29.894 --> 02:50:32.415]  Not just the glyphosates with the fluoride lowering IQ, all of it.
[02:50:32.415 --> 02:50:34.356]  People are suddenly ordering more filters from us.
[02:50:34.356 --> 02:50:34.556]  Yeah.
[02:50:35.336 --> 02:50:36.177]  So it's a win-win.
[02:50:36.177 --> 02:50:40.399]  And we also have a new film that I'm in, a lot of other folks are in.
[02:50:40.399 --> 02:50:42.080]  It's You Can't Watch This.
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:43.800]  It's won a whole bunch of big film awards.
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:48.883]  And of course, it's good to have this in your library because nowadays they're taking everything offline.
[02:50:48.883 --> 02:50:49.984]  So it's good to have original books.
[02:50:49.984 --> 02:50:51.805]  It's good to have DVDs.
[02:50:51.805 --> 02:50:54.606]  It's good to have things that you can copy and share with others.
[02:50:54.606 --> 02:50:57.448]  So You Can't Watch This, very powerful film.
[02:50:58.539 --> 02:51:00.240]  One major awards.
[02:51:00.240 --> 02:51:06.922]  Alex Jones, Gavin McGinnis, Paul Joseph Watson, Tommy Robinson, and Laura Loomer.
[02:51:06.922 --> 02:51:07.882]  Look at those names.
[02:51:07.882 --> 02:51:08.982]  Laura Loomer is totally banned.
[02:51:08.982 --> 02:51:10.183]  Tommy Robinson is banned everywhere.
[02:51:10.183 --> 02:51:13.184]  He's in jail for free speech exposing pedophile rings.
[02:51:13.184 --> 02:51:15.124]  Paul Joseph Watson is a hunted man.
[02:51:15.124 --> 02:51:16.405]  Gavin McGinnis, all the stuff there.
[02:51:18.206 --> 02:51:21.107]  That's where we've gotten here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:51:21.107 --> 02:51:23.107]  I like my belly hanging out.
[02:51:23.107 --> 02:51:25.348]  I've lost 10 pounds since then, but it doesn't matter.
[02:51:25.348 --> 02:51:29.669]  It's a good film, and people should get it and donate it to local libraries.
[02:51:29.669 --> 02:51:31.190]  That way you reach more folks.
[02:51:31.190 --> 02:51:40.412]  It'll go right alongside the pedophile books at the local library, teaching six-year-olds how much it is fun to meet men at parks and being driven off in vans.
[02:51:40.412 --> 02:51:41.032]  I'm not kidding.
[02:51:41.032 --> 02:51:41.873]  We covered that yesterday.
[02:51:43.513 --> 02:51:44.814]  The bottom's broken out, folks.
[02:51:44.814 --> 02:51:46.796]  Hell is here, but we are here to counter it.
[02:51:46.796 --> 02:51:51.239]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[02:51:51.239 --> 02:51:53.100]  Okay, who was I talking to?
[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:55.022]  Jefferson in Virginia.
[02:51:55.022 --> 02:51:55.882]  Go ahead and make your points.
[02:51:55.882 --> 02:51:58.404]  Thanks for holding.
[02:51:58.404 --> 02:51:59.225]  Thanks again, Alex.
[02:51:59.225 --> 02:52:03.368]  On the funding front, I'm pretty sure you can turn the script around on Obama and the leftists here.
[02:52:03.368 --> 02:52:06.350]  He set up the countering disinformation and propaganda
[02:52:06.954 --> 02:52:12.059]  You know, that's a good idea, but you know, the center was created to counter me, so I don't know if the directors of that are going to go along with that.
[02:52:31.021 --> 02:52:35.424]  Well, the president is not the king of the country, but he is the king of the executive branch.
[02:52:35.424 --> 02:52:39.606]  And he can direct them to do what he wants them to do in the executive branch.
[02:52:39.606 --> 02:52:43.989]  By the way, Jefferson, get his name and number for the weekend show I'm going to start doing.
[02:52:43.989 --> 02:52:45.970]  I'm going to start doing it.
[02:52:45.970 --> 02:52:47.131]  And other weekends, there'll be other hosts.
[02:52:47.131 --> 02:52:50.293]  But where we have guest callers on that co-host together.
[02:52:50.293 --> 02:52:51.894]  I think he used to be one of those guys, Jefferson.
[02:52:51.894 --> 02:52:53.194]  You've got a great voice.
[02:52:53.194 --> 02:52:54.255]  I can tell you're pretty smart.
[02:52:54.255 --> 02:52:56.777]  What line of work are you in?
[02:52:56.777 --> 02:52:57.737]  I'd rather not say.
[02:52:57.737 --> 02:53:00.739]  But your caller yesterday, Stewart, was a great caller.
[02:53:01.337 --> 02:53:09.083]  Your discussion with him was fantastic and you touched on another solution which was the comprehensive annual financial reports.
[02:53:09.083 --> 02:53:12.305]  Stuart didn't want to talk about it but you should speak about it more often.
[02:53:12.305 --> 02:53:20.691]  There's 80 trillion dollars sitting around in those funds that they're hiding from us in the second set of books and you know about it and I know about it.
[02:53:20.691 --> 02:53:28.036]  And that's a subject and we need to revisit all those subjects that I covered hundreds of times but then just I kind of drop it like a dog finally drops it you know
[02:53:31.683 --> 02:53:42.770]  Yeah, I think if we want to expand our audience, we have to go back to the basics of what we made ourselves into here.
[02:53:42.770 --> 02:53:57.539]  You know, they call us propagandists, they call us disinformation people, but what we're trying to do is make people aware of what the big scam is, and it's clearly going on, and if we want more people to tune in to what we're saying, we've got to go build on the foundation.
[02:53:58.340 --> 02:53:58.720]  I hear you.
[02:53:58.720 --> 02:54:03.644]  Well, hey, if you want to be part of that show, I've told my crew we've got to start it within the next two weeks.
[02:54:03.644 --> 02:54:04.604]  I keep saying I'm going to do it.
[02:54:04.604 --> 02:54:06.486]  I still come in every weekend and do shows.
[02:54:06.486 --> 02:54:09.648]  So we're intending to launch Saturdays, I think.
[02:54:09.648 --> 02:54:11.549]  I think the best time would probably be in the afternoon.
[02:54:11.549 --> 02:54:16.492]  And that way, people that want to go out at night can still go out at night, but we can do it live and then archive it.
[02:54:16.492 --> 02:54:24.257]  People will watch Saturday night and just have a roundtable discussion each week with like five or six callers, maybe have a group of 20 people we have that we rotate through.
[02:54:24.257 --> 02:54:26.619]  And I just think it'll be something really, really exciting.
[02:54:26.619 --> 02:54:27.540]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:28.040]  God bless you.
[02:54:29.661 --> 02:54:30.481]  Hey, I live here in Austin.
[02:54:30.481 --> 02:54:30.942]  I've called before.
[02:54:30.942 --> 02:54:33.183]  I used to work in music and rock and roll and all that.
[02:54:33.183 --> 02:54:33.843]  I wanted to say yesterday
[02:54:53.601 --> 02:54:55.703]  I got an InfoWars original for you.
[02:54:55.703 --> 02:55:10.660]  We want to use a music analogy for the current political situation that also gets into what you were talking about today with the chemicals and the additives and everything that these clown world Democrats, you know, you hosted the show, we know what it is.
[02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:13.463]  They're like the goofball pop stars on American Idol.
[02:55:13.962 --> 02:55:19.523]  He's begging for Simon Cowell's approval, while Trump is the greatest punk rocker of all time.
[02:55:19.523 --> 02:55:23.824]  You know, recording his own records, booking his own tours, playing what people want.
[02:55:23.824 --> 02:55:25.505]  He exists outside the system.
[02:55:25.505 --> 02:55:27.885]  He's the president, but he's not the man, right?
[02:55:27.885 --> 02:55:35.967]  You could also use the Elvis and Led Zeppelin analogy, because everybody that knows rock history, they wrote their own book, they called the shots.
[02:55:35.967 --> 02:55:37.787]  And pretty much nobody else ever did.
[02:55:37.787 --> 02:55:39.788]  Even the Beatles couldn't really call their own shots.
[02:55:40.475 --> 02:55:41.355]  Nope.
[02:55:41.355 --> 02:55:43.016]  Very few of them do.
[02:55:43.016 --> 02:55:47.658]  And even if they have the ability to, there's other factors in play.
[02:55:47.658 --> 02:55:53.740]  And so, when you had all the stuff on the desk today, you know, all the different mouthwashes and all that, it's the same thing.
[02:55:53.740 --> 02:55:58.321]  You don't have to get Crest and Colgate just because it's on the shelf in the store.
[02:55:58.321 --> 02:56:00.862]  There are other options.
[02:56:00.862 --> 02:56:03.883]  But you've got to seek those options out.
[02:56:03.883 --> 02:56:04.704]  Absolutely.
[02:56:06.624 --> 02:56:07.724]  Don't go with the flow.
[02:56:07.724 --> 02:56:11.626]  No matter what you do, where you are, don't go with the flow.
[02:56:11.626 --> 02:56:16.628]  You made a comment earlier about why do these people think the gay thing is so great.
[02:56:16.628 --> 02:56:18.009]  There was an old Chris Rock joke.
[02:56:18.009 --> 02:56:21.470]  If everyone had a gay cousin, he was gay before he knew who gay was.
[02:56:21.470 --> 02:56:24.071]  You were playing basketball and he was skipping rope.
[02:56:24.071 --> 02:56:26.712]  If it's a natural thing, God bless you.
[02:56:26.712 --> 02:56:33.455]  But all these people that, oh, it's so liberal, it's so enlightened, they do this as a substitute for a personality.
[02:56:33.823 --> 02:56:37.125]  They can't stand on their own two feet, so they do that identity politics.
[02:56:37.125 --> 02:56:37.665]  Well that's it.
[02:56:37.665 --> 02:56:44.670]  Plus, exactly, they've added a leftist, globalist position on the identity of being gay, so of course they want you to now be gay.
[02:56:44.670 --> 02:56:47.952]  And really, it's about not having children depopulated.
[02:56:47.952 --> 02:56:50.253]  If people don't want to have kids, that's their issue.
[02:56:50.253 --> 02:56:51.674]  I'm not saying they're bad.
[02:56:51.674 --> 02:56:54.195]  That's a total issue of whatever.
[02:56:54.195 --> 02:56:55.056]  Some people can't have kids.
[02:56:55.656 --> 02:57:07.464]  So, and to act like the country that's been the most open and liberal towards everybody is the bad country, when America's led the way in empowering people, they're using our strength against us.
[02:57:07.464 --> 02:57:10.546]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[02:57:10.546 --> 02:57:17.231]  But I'm telling you, the LGBT community now is pedophilic, it's evil, and I will oppose it.
[02:57:18.268 --> 02:57:19.529]  I will absolutely oppose it.
[02:57:19.529 --> 02:57:23.350]  I mean, I oppose Jeffrey Epstein trying to have sex with ten-year-old girls.
[02:57:23.350 --> 02:57:24.930]  Believe me, they got younger than that.
[02:57:24.930 --> 02:57:29.432]  And I oppose, you know, some pervert homosexual who wants to have sex with a little boy.
[02:57:29.432 --> 02:57:31.113]  It's disgusting and it's evil.
[02:57:31.113 --> 02:57:34.574]  Keep your damn hands off the kids.
[02:57:34.574 --> 02:57:38.295]  Or we're gonna hang you from the neck till dead.
[02:57:38.295 --> 02:57:40.036]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:58:44.872 --> 02:58:44.992]  Yes.
[02:58:44.992 --> 02:58:45.232]  Oh, thanks.
[02:59:14.912 --> 02:59:17.513]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[02:59:17.513 --> 02:59:18.994]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[02:59:18.994 --> 02:59:20.054]  I want a good price.
[02:59:20.054 --> 02:59:24.156]  But I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off.
[02:59:24.156 --> 02:59:26.417]  I'm making $2 on the toothpaste 50% off.
[02:59:26.417 --> 02:59:29.999]  And so it's the same thing with like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[02:59:29.999 --> 02:59:30.960]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:35.162]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss later.
[02:59:35.162 --> 02:59:42.925]  Because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, and then we're doing 50% off, and then you do something like that, where you have Patriot points, we lose money.
[02:59:42.925 --> 02:59:43.486]  But that's okay.
[02:59:43.486 --> 02:59:44.106]  Thanks for the support.
[02:59:47.683 --> 02:59:53.808]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:53.808 --> 02:59:55.949]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:55.949 --> 02:59:58.291]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:15.933 --> 03:00:16.694]  It's insane!
[03:00:16.694 --> 03:00:17.394]  It's insane!
[03:00:17.394 --> 03:00:18.195]  And they know it.
[03:00:18.195 --> 03:00:21.217]  And it's not like Prop 65 where they say, you know, at one billionth
[03:00:31.701 --> 03:00:34.623]  A piece of lead kills you and it's a fraud.
[03:00:34.623 --> 03:00:40.167]  It's the left saying fluoridate, fluoridate at super high toxic levels that they know hurts you.
[03:00:40.167 --> 03:00:43.730]  And then going, oh, but a factory is putting out carbon dioxide.
[03:00:43.730 --> 03:00:44.891]  It's deadly.
[03:00:44.891 --> 03:00:46.992]  Plants breathe it.
[03:00:46.992 --> 03:00:48.833]  They claim they're the environmentalists.
[03:00:48.833 --> 03:00:50.955]  They claim they're the guardians of humans.
[03:00:50.955 --> 03:00:53.377]  But the left can't talk about how they want to kill everybody.
[03:00:54.909 --> 03:00:58.210]  Well, these callers have been super awesome.
[03:00:58.210 --> 03:01:00.970]  They're always great, but man, these are some great calls.
[03:01:00.970 --> 03:01:03.671]  Chris, Dennis, Chris, David, Chris, Joseph.
[03:01:03.671 --> 03:01:05.972]  We'll get to all of you, then Mike Adams is taking over.
[03:01:05.972 --> 03:01:09.912]  Got a few more clips I'm gonna play next segment I haven't gotten to yet.
[03:01:09.912 --> 03:01:13.433]  Well, we'll play them next segment, but right now, who's been holding longest now?
[03:01:13.433 --> 03:01:14.594]  Chris in Illinois.
[03:01:14.594 --> 03:01:15.494]  Then we'll go to David and others.
[03:01:15.494 --> 03:01:15.914]  Go ahead, Chris.
[03:01:17.628 --> 03:01:18.949]  Hey, Alex.
[03:01:18.949 --> 03:01:29.335]  You know, I've been selling water filtration here in Chicago for about 12 years, and I recently have seen more calls for RO filtration, which actually removes the fluoride.
[03:01:29.335 --> 03:01:34.518]  We offer something that actually puts the minerals back in after filtration, so that's good news.
[03:01:36.405 --> 03:01:41.407]  And then one other point real quick about the... Well, let me just stop you because people ask me what's the best water filtration.
[03:01:41.407 --> 03:01:42.568]  This is important.
[03:01:42.568 --> 03:01:44.949]  The best thing is reverse osmosis.
[03:01:44.949 --> 03:01:47.550]  Cuts out 100%, as you know, if it's set up properly.
[03:01:47.550 --> 03:01:48.971]  Very inexpensive.
[03:01:48.971 --> 03:01:50.111]  And that's what I use for cooking.
[03:01:50.111 --> 03:01:51.972]  But you better add the minerals back in.
[03:01:51.972 --> 03:01:52.912]  That's critical.
[03:01:52.912 --> 03:01:59.215]  Because if you drink only distilled water or only reverse osmosis, you get some major problems from that, right?
[03:01:59.215 --> 03:01:59.575]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:59.575 --> 03:02:00.096]  That's a fact.
[03:02:01.075 --> 03:02:04.736]  We actually do a post treatment that puts like 20 minerals back in.
[03:02:04.736 --> 03:02:11.237]  And that's the good news is you're only getting the good minerals because most minerals that are already in the water raw are bound to other chemicals and toxins.
[03:02:11.237 --> 03:02:14.218]  So that's why it's critical to just take everything out.
[03:02:14.218 --> 03:02:14.578]  Correct.
[03:02:14.578 --> 03:02:17.738]  And you know, the thing is that we get a lot of calls into the office.
[03:02:17.738 --> 03:02:19.179]  People want RO.
[03:02:19.179 --> 03:02:21.379]  They're becoming more educated.
[03:02:21.379 --> 03:02:24.820]  Oh, I mean, today I've had three conversations with people that
[03:02:25.512 --> 03:02:27.973]  That have said, I want the fluoride out of the water, essentially.
[03:02:27.973 --> 03:02:33.815]  Yeah, well RO's the best way to go, except, or still, if you add good minerals back, it just better be the right thing.
[03:02:33.815 --> 03:02:41.018]  That's why I just go with Gravity Feds, because they cut out all the toxic chemicals, leave some of the minerals, and so if people don't know what they're doing, it's the best system.
[03:02:41.018 --> 03:02:43.899]  I literally, morally think about the best systems.
[03:02:43.899 --> 03:02:50.462]  We also sell reverse osmosis, we've just got to notice about it, because, of course, you explain to people though, you better add the minerals back.
[03:02:51.840 --> 03:02:53.101]  That is correct, yes.
[03:02:53.101 --> 03:02:58.464]  Because it trips it down to hydrogen and oxygen, the two elements of water.
[03:02:58.464 --> 03:03:01.525]  You want absolutely pure water, it's reverse osmosis.
[03:03:01.525 --> 03:03:04.807]  That's my own research, but I'm sorry to keep interrupting.
[03:03:04.807 --> 03:03:06.128]  What's your main point?
[03:03:06.128 --> 03:03:18.834]  Well, so, you know, The Hunt, that movie, The Hunt, I don't know if you've covered this, I'm sorry, I haven't been able to listen a lot, but, you know, Dick Cheney was in Kathy O'Brien's book about how he... The Most Dangerous Game.
[03:03:18.834 --> 03:03:19.575]  The Most Dangerous Game.
[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:47.001]  And so I've been calling Liz Cheney's office and asking them about it, and they don't really like me calling and asking them, but I mean, you know, it's not that, you know, I just don't understand why these things are occurring, but it still seems out of the realm of possibility for people, and it's actually happened already with a vice president of ours, you know, hunting people.
[03:03:48.516 --> 03:03:51.538]  And you know, a lot of folks don't understand that hunting people's been done.
[03:03:51.538 --> 03:03:54.520]  The Romans did it, the Babylonians did it.
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:57.922]  Hunting folks is a very old deal.
[03:03:57.922 --> 03:04:03.325]  And it goes back to sometimes you'd let prisoners go or gladiators go and then run them through swamps and things.
[03:04:03.325 --> 03:04:04.866]  And so, truth is stranger than fiction.
[03:04:04.866 --> 03:04:05.387]  Great points.
[03:04:05.387 --> 03:04:07.168]  Anything else?
[03:04:07.168 --> 03:04:07.748]  That's it.
[03:04:07.748 --> 03:04:08.488]  Keep it up, man.
[03:04:08.488 --> 03:04:09.689]  Love you guys.
[03:04:09.689 --> 03:04:11.730]  Love you too, brother.
[03:04:11.730 --> 03:04:13.111]  Yeah, you know, that piece that
[03:04:14.375 --> 03:04:17.276]  Greg Reese put together was powerful, but I encouraged him.
[03:04:17.276 --> 03:04:26.579]  I said, go back and do a bigger one with Ewing Cameron, who actually, Dr. Ewing Cameron, who actually ran the MKUltra program.
[03:04:26.579 --> 03:04:41.423]  And it was declassified in 77 that he had kidnapped more than 10,000 children and taken them mainly to Canada and also New York and turned them into robots.
[03:04:41.423 --> 03:04:43.044]  I mean, they were totally programmed.
[03:04:44.112 --> 03:04:47.840]  And that was in the 60s and 70s he did that.
[03:04:47.840 --> 03:04:48.541]  That's what they do.
[03:04:48.541 --> 03:04:49.464]  This is really real, folks.
[03:04:53.405 --> 03:05:00.032]  One half of the incredible eight pack power stack, the AM wake up and work packet is exactly what you need to start your day right.
[03:05:00.032 --> 03:05:06.238]  The pack contains five original formulas built to fuel your day and take care of your body's individual needs in the morning.
[03:05:06.238 --> 03:05:09.862]  Targeting the heart, brain, muscles, energy production, and more.
[03:05:09.862 --> 03:05:16.808]  Each AM pack contains a flex and joint support, energy kick start, krill oil, nootropic brain, and greens detox formula.
[03:05:17.629 --> 03:05:18.409]  With the P.M.
[03:05:18.409 --> 03:05:23.111]  Pack and the 8 Pack Power Stack, you can rest easy and simplify your routine.
[03:05:23.111 --> 03:05:25.753]  Containing four original formulas, the P.M.
[03:05:25.753 --> 03:05:32.175]  Rest and Recover Pack will build up your body's defenses and help you get restful, satisfying sleep every night.
[03:05:32.175 --> 03:05:37.057]  Containing bone support, krill oil, sound sleep, and immune support formulas, the P.M.
[03:05:37.057 --> 03:05:42.920]  Packet was created to support improving your body's bones and immune system, all while you rest from the day's work.
[03:05:43.180 --> 03:05:49.962]  When combined with the AM wake-up and work packet, it makes the 8-pack power stack the new can't-miss InfoWars life product.
[03:06:05.052 --> 03:06:07.155]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're in hour number four.
[03:06:07.155 --> 03:06:09.779]  Coming in, Mike Adams, The Health Ranger, NaturalNews.com.
[03:06:09.779 --> 03:06:11.822]  More of your calls here in a moment.
[03:06:11.822 --> 03:06:12.803]  I have two clips I want to play.
[03:06:14.472 --> 03:06:19.275]  One of these, I had the idea today when I was talking about fluorides like a weapon targeting children.
[03:06:19.275 --> 03:06:21.917]  They admitted it, so I showed the documents and all the new studies.
[03:06:21.917 --> 03:06:24.699]  And this big awakening, people are like, oh my god, you're right, incredible!
[03:06:24.699 --> 03:06:26.920]  How does what you said come true again?
[03:06:26.920 --> 03:06:36.146]  I showed people seven or eight other big Harvard studies, Mexican national government studies, Chinese studies, German studies, saying the exact same thing.
[03:06:36.146 --> 03:06:39.248]  I mean, these studies are done well.
[03:06:39.248 --> 03:06:43.651]  Kids just drinking fluoride a year lowers it about a point a year.
[03:06:45.197 --> 03:06:46.899]  Wow.
[03:06:46.899 --> 03:06:48.480]  Wow.
[03:06:48.480 --> 03:06:49.621]  Wow.
[03:06:49.621 --> 03:06:51.763]  And that's just what's in the water.
[03:06:51.763 --> 03:06:55.065]  It's much stronger in toothpaste.
[03:06:55.065 --> 03:07:01.591]  But, uh, I said it's much like Darth Vader, like, you know, shooting and targeting, uh, the, uh, kids or, or, you know, you know, predator.
[03:07:01.591 --> 03:07:07.836]  I mean, this is a weapons system, like on a box of shells for hunting varmints.
[03:07:07.836 --> 03:07:09.898]  If it's for coyotes, it shows a coyote.
[03:07:09.898 --> 03:07:12.300]  If it's for prairie dogs, it shows a prairie dog.
[03:07:13.379 --> 03:07:15.921]  If it's for a white-tailed deer, it shows a white-tailed deer.
[03:07:15.921 --> 03:07:17.602]  If it's for a moose, it shows a moose.
[03:07:17.602 --> 03:07:24.087]  Well, on the fluoride box of the fluoride water is a baby, because that's the target.
[03:07:24.087 --> 03:07:25.208]  It's a baby's brain.
[03:07:25.208 --> 03:07:27.530]  So here's that quick clip.
[03:07:27.530 --> 03:07:36.137]  If you took your six-month-old baby and dropped it on its head on purpose, you would lose that child if you were seen doing it.
[03:07:36.137 --> 03:07:37.838]  And you should.
[03:07:37.838 --> 03:07:42.362]  If you're wondering why it's like a zombie apocalypse out there and why there's mental illness everywhere and why people seem
[03:07:43.843 --> 03:08:08.098]  So incredibly stupid, it's because the Soviets, the communists, the proto-globalists that took over, had work camps, and they put hydrofluorosilicic acid in the water and lots of other stuff to test it on the people in the gulags.
[03:08:08.098 --> 03:08:12.361]  I went to HEB this morning, the crew did, walked right in, it says HEB
[03:08:14.406 --> 03:08:18.570]  Baby fluoride water.
[03:08:18.570 --> 03:08:20.072]  Let's zoom right in on that.
[03:08:20.072 --> 03:08:21.673]  And notice it shows you the target.
[03:08:21.673 --> 03:08:31.463]  It's kind of like buying a box of 30-odd-6 rifle shells, rifle rounds, and on the cover is a deer.
[03:08:31.463 --> 03:08:33.645]  And there's a little crosshair on the side of the deer.
[03:08:48.914 --> 03:08:55.039]  Maximum firepower!
[03:08:55.039 --> 03:08:57.841]  Oh, I mean, oh baby!
[03:08:57.841 --> 03:09:01.844]  It's time to kill brain cells!
[03:09:01.844 --> 03:09:05.046]  So much more fun to take our time.
[03:09:05.046 --> 03:09:09.049]  And then it's bye-bye brain, and you've got a good automaton.
[03:09:14.724 --> 03:09:17.926]  That's scary as hell, because it's all real, folks.
[03:09:17.926 --> 03:09:26.271]  But there's the cognitive dissonance that the White House science czar wrote this huge book about putting flora in the water to brain damage you 45 years ago.
[03:09:26.271 --> 03:09:29.153]  It was published the year I was born, EcoScience.
[03:09:29.153 --> 03:09:32.535]  And it's like, well, oh, 5G, they admit, is way worse than kill us.
[03:09:32.535 --> 03:09:33.575]  Okay.
[03:09:33.575 --> 03:09:34.516]  Bye-bye.
[03:09:34.516 --> 03:09:34.956]  I die.
[03:09:34.956 --> 03:09:39.719]  There'll be these marathons that raise money for everybody getting brain tumors.
[03:09:40.868 --> 03:09:49.375]  Instead of just stopping it, not letting these people do it, but until we admit they're a bunch of eugenicist devil worshippers, it's only going to get worse.
[03:09:49.375 --> 03:09:54.739]  Yes, a gang of psychotics took over our government.
[03:09:54.739 --> 03:10:01.184]  That's why they don't want Trump getting into everything, because they've done so many crimes.
[03:10:01.184 --> 03:10:03.946]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[03:10:03.946 --> 03:10:08.410]  Dennis in Virginia, and then we'll go to David and Chris and everybody else.
[03:10:08.410 --> 03:10:09.891]  Dennis in Virginia, thanks for holding.
[03:10:10.899 --> 03:10:13.480]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on again.
[03:10:13.480 --> 03:10:22.004]  Yeah, I just saw your clip on Maxine Waters, and I tell you, she epitomizes the effects of fluoride toxication.
[03:10:22.004 --> 03:10:27.067]  Yeah, she's sitting with a homeless lady trying to sell books to help the homeless community, and she wants her change back.
[03:10:27.067 --> 03:10:32.830]  She's worth, I think she's worth like a hundred million or something herself, and she wanted to give the lady a ten dollars.
[03:10:32.830 --> 03:10:34.010]  She's way out there.
[03:10:34.010 --> 03:10:35.511]  She's like, I need change!
[03:10:35.511 --> 03:10:36.992]  I'm not giving her ten extra dollars!
[03:10:38.194 --> 03:10:39.334]  At least produces the fluoride.
[03:10:39.334 --> 03:10:42.535]  I mean, they're making billions of dollars for pumping the poisons, you know.
[03:10:42.535 --> 03:10:43.375]  Oh, I forgot!
[03:10:43.375 --> 03:10:44.495]  We get to pay.
[03:10:44.495 --> 03:10:45.136]  I've seen that.
[03:10:45.136 --> 03:10:49.897]  I think Austin pays $3 million a year for the poison.
[03:10:49.897 --> 03:10:50.757]  It's crazy.
[03:10:50.757 --> 03:10:57.459]  You know, and it's all the things you said and, you know, not, you know, I asked a lot of friends of mine, I said, would you brush your teeth with arsenic?
[03:10:57.459 --> 03:10:58.619]  They said, well, no.
[03:10:58.619 --> 03:11:02.400]  I said, well, fluoride is only slightly less toxic than arsenic.
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:03.920]  So why would you brush your teeth with it?
[03:11:03.920 --> 03:11:07.841]  You know, and it binds with metals in the brain, causing dementia, Alzheimer's.
[03:11:08.590 --> 03:11:15.653]  And watching your program about fluoride before, you know how it competes with iodine, I started using your X3.
[03:11:15.653 --> 03:11:23.797]  And I got about a month ago, and I'm kind of skeptical on a lot of products out there, but yours, everything I've ever got from you guys, I mean, it's been right on.
[03:11:23.797 --> 03:11:26.278]  And the X3, I mean, I can really tell the difference.
[03:11:26.278 --> 03:11:36.023]  It took probably like 10 days to start kicking in, but because of what I've learned from fluoride being a halogen and competing with iodine as a thyroid and how it affects the body,
[03:11:36.724 --> 03:11:39.088]  It's like, you know, I said I'm going to give it a try and it really works.
[03:11:39.088 --> 03:11:42.294]  And I got your electric pure water filter too.
[03:11:42.294 --> 03:11:44.097]  Brother, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[03:11:44.097 --> 03:11:47.542]  But yeah, good clean iodine is a whole other world.
[03:11:47.542 --> 03:11:48.845]  And it's just amazing what it does.
[03:11:48.845 --> 03:11:49.305]  God bless you.
[03:11:49.305 --> 03:11:49.987]  I appreciate the call.
[03:11:50.959 --> 03:11:53.061]  Okay, let's go to David in California.
[03:11:53.061 --> 03:11:53.561]  Thanks for holding.
[03:11:53.561 --> 03:11:54.722]  You're on the air with another plug.
[03:11:54.722 --> 03:11:57.163]  I appreciate all the plugging, but this all goes together.
[03:11:57.163 --> 03:12:03.348]  Like, the krill oil is what makes the blood-brain barrier stronger, and it's what the brain works off of.
[03:12:03.348 --> 03:12:06.870]  I mean, I get high off these, and I'm not into drugs.
[03:12:06.870 --> 03:12:08.331]  You know, I smoked marijuana once a year.
[03:12:08.331 --> 03:12:09.993]  I haven't done anything since like college.
[03:12:09.993 --> 03:12:10.673]  I tried a few things.
[03:12:12.194 --> 03:12:20.601]  I take krill oil and fish oil before I go to bed because I sleep deeper, I have incredible dreams, and the studies are there.
[03:12:20.601 --> 03:12:23.504]  Go ahead, David, thanks for calling.
[03:12:23.504 --> 03:12:29.568]  I just wanted to plug the honor roll real quick.
[03:12:29.568 --> 03:12:40.357]  My son just started school a few weeks ago, and the first week was kind of rough for him, and got him going on the honor roll about the end of that week, and sure enough, the following week and the weeks after that were just
[03:12:42.287 --> 03:12:51.114]  Well, don't you know the old wives' tale for hundreds of years?
[03:12:51.114 --> 03:12:56.778]  My mother's mother would make her take cod oil every morning before school.
[03:12:56.778 --> 03:13:00.060]  And she'd literally grab her by the nose when she was littler and say, you know, take it.
[03:13:00.060 --> 03:13:01.622]  But that's what you do.
[03:13:01.622 --> 03:13:03.143]  Mothers knew.
[03:13:03.143 --> 03:13:07.006]  Mothers used to put a little bit of cod oil in baby milk once the baby was six months old.
[03:13:08.069 --> 03:13:10.610]  Well, we don't do that anymore, and the IQs are going straight down.
[03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:11.690]  There's an article on that.
[03:13:11.690 --> 03:13:15.531]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:13:15.531 --> 03:13:28.655]  Yeah, not just that, but the Ultimate Fish Oil as well has been helping me out, just putting words together and kind of being able to communicate a lot better, putting ideas and whatnot together.
[03:13:28.655 --> 03:13:33.256]  But mainly, I just wanted to just touch on the whole fluoride thing.
[03:13:33.256 --> 03:13:35.577]  I mean, it's kind of, it's just,
[03:13:36.016 --> 03:13:49.406]  It really is sad when, you know, you walk into a Walmart and you see rows and rows of this, you know, water that's got added fluoride on it and then it's clearly got a picture of a baby on it.
[03:13:49.406 --> 03:13:56.150]  You know, I mean, most people aren't even going to go out and look at the label, see what's actually in it.
[03:13:56.150 --> 03:13:58.992]  They're just going to see water and a baby and say, oh man, here we go.
[03:13:58.992 --> 03:14:00.934]  This is exactly what I needed.
[03:14:00.934 --> 03:14:02.735]  And I mean, it's just, they're,
[03:14:03.556 --> 03:14:06.617]  It's sad because it's only making this a lot worse.
[03:14:06.617 --> 03:14:15.620]  I just barely started researching and started looking into this, what fluoride actually does, and it's all because of you and everything you've put out there.
[03:14:15.620 --> 03:14:19.442]  But brother, it's not because of me, and I'm not saying this to disagree with you.
[03:14:19.442 --> 03:14:20.962]  Do you understand?
[03:14:20.962 --> 03:14:24.404]  It is you, the listener, that has spread the word, that already knows all this too.
[03:14:24.404 --> 03:14:25.124]  I'm just covering stuff.
[03:14:25.124 --> 03:14:26.364]  It's all public knowledge.
[03:14:26.364 --> 03:14:27.525]  It's you that carries the ball.
[03:14:27.525 --> 03:14:29.085]  Thanks to you.
[03:14:29.085 --> 03:14:29.566]  God bless you.
[03:14:29.566 --> 03:14:30.386]  I appreciate your call, David.
[03:14:31.195 --> 03:14:33.235]  Oh, he had one more drag queen story.
[03:14:33.235 --> 03:14:34.536]  It's not drag queen.
[03:14:34.536 --> 03:14:36.736]  I was reading this article about the drag queen axe murder.
[03:14:36.736 --> 03:14:39.756]  We're going to play that clip, we'll go to Mike Adams' next segment.
[03:14:39.756 --> 03:14:43.657]  And from Australia, and they only gave this dude six years.
[03:14:43.657 --> 03:14:48.038]  He comes in, attacks everybody with axes, hacks their heads in.
[03:14:48.038 --> 03:14:49.718]  People are deformed for life, they survive.
[03:14:49.718 --> 03:14:55.159]  Attacks a black lady, attacks some white dudes.
[03:14:55.159 --> 03:14:59.720]  And, you know, he walks over to what looks like a trendy gay dude or something, and the guy's being nice to him.
[03:15:01.482 --> 03:15:06.806]  But you see, this trans man, woman, wanted women.
[03:15:06.806 --> 03:15:10.008]  And a woman turned him down.
[03:15:10.008 --> 03:15:12.250]  And so he went in and attacked people with an axe.
[03:15:12.250 --> 03:15:15.372]  And the left's like, well, people were mean to him.
[03:15:15.372 --> 03:15:19.395]  And a higher court said, no, you're getting 40 years.
[03:15:19.395 --> 03:15:23.698]  You're not getting six years for walking in and attacking people with an axe.
[03:15:23.698 --> 03:15:27.942]  So we're going to play that footage coming up next segment.
[03:15:27.942 --> 03:15:29.383]  Go to Mike Adams and a few more of your calls.
[03:15:30.157 --> 03:15:35.079]  But, they're just worshipping someone that becomes trans, because it's going to be brain chips.
[03:15:35.079 --> 03:15:37.000]  It's going to be, they're going to have clones.
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:44.243]  They're already born walking around, and the big crime will be saying, hey, I don't want your corporate produced clones that work for you telling me what to do.
[03:15:44.243 --> 03:15:44.963]  I'm a human.
[03:15:44.963 --> 03:15:49.105]  They're going to say, that's a restable offense, because anything trans is super cool.
[03:15:51.960 --> 03:15:53.181]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:53.181 --> 03:15:57.102]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:57.102 --> 03:15:58.623]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.623 --> 03:16:01.585]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.585 --> 03:16:07.147]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:07.147 --> 03:16:08.348]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.348 --> 03:16:11.289]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.289 --> 03:16:13.510]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.510 --> 03:16:17.952]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:17.952 --> 03:16:20.253]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:21.514 --> 03:16:27.856]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:27.856 --> 03:16:30.897]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:30.897 --> 03:16:36.819]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:36.819 --> 03:16:40.620]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:40.620 --> 03:16:41.880]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:43.221]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:43.221 --> 03:16:49.422]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:49.422 --> 03:16:50.843]  Available at Amazon Books.

[03:17:53.586 --> 03:18:00.110]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:18:00.967 --> 03:18:05.252]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[03:18:05.252 --> 03:18:08.976]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:18:14.639 --> 03:18:16.340]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:18:16.340 --> 03:18:17.561]  This is racketeering.
[03:18:17.561 --> 03:18:18.682]  This is cartels.
[03:18:18.682 --> 03:18:21.083]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:18:21.083 --> 03:18:22.965]  We need it now.
[03:18:22.965 --> 03:18:24.646]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:18:24.646 --> 03:18:33.592]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:18:33.592 --> 03:18:41.637]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:18:41.637 --> 03:18:42.498]  The way to fight back
[03:18:43.138 --> 03:18:47.983]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:18:47.983 --> 03:18:51.748]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:18:52.574 --> 03:19:05.737]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[03:19:05.737 --> 03:19:08.658]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:19:08.658 --> 03:19:10.418]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:19:10.418 --> 03:19:14.059]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[03:19:14.699 --> 03:19:19.263]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:19:19.263 --> 03:19:20.304]  That's beautiful.
[03:19:20.304 --> 03:19:22.205]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:19:22.205 --> 03:19:23.807]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:19:23.807 --> 03:19:31.413]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:19:31.413 --> 03:19:33.735]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:19:33.735 --> 03:19:37.899]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:19:37.899 --> 03:19:38.859]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:43.744]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[03:19:43.744 --> 03:19:44.846]  We are the resistance.
[03:19:44.846 --> 03:19:45.807]  We are 1776 worldwide.
[03:19:45.807 --> 03:19:51.012]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.794 --> 03:20:13.016]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:13.016 --> 03:20:16.759]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:20:16.759 --> 03:20:18.381]  Dance all night.
[03:20:18.381 --> 03:20:20.022]  Play all day.
[03:20:20.022 --> 03:20:22.865]  Don't let nothing get in the way.
[03:20:22.865 --> 03:20:24.886]  Dance all night.
[03:20:24.886 --> 03:20:26.548]  Keep the beat.
[03:20:26.548 --> 03:20:29.310]  Don't worry about a thing.
[03:20:29.310 --> 03:20:29.811]  Shake it up!
[03:20:52.890 --> 03:20:53.991]  So I married an axe murderer.
[03:20:53.991 --> 03:21:05.378]  We make jokes about this, but in Australia, a man, you read the court filings, like, this woman attacked people randomly with axes, but it's a man.
[03:21:05.378 --> 03:21:13.064]  And we're all supposed to play along with this mental illness, so this man was only given six years for attacking people for no reason, start rolling the video, please.
[03:21:13.064 --> 03:21:14.364]  And for TV viewers.
[03:21:14.364 --> 03:21:19.568]  And the higher court said, no, you're going to get more time, because the left had said, well, this person's a victim.
[03:21:19.568 --> 03:21:22.029]  He's allowed to go around as a protection class.
[03:21:22.998 --> 03:21:26.259]  Just randomly come into stores and try to menace people.
[03:21:26.259 --> 03:21:27.340]  And then nobody was scared.
[03:21:27.340 --> 03:21:29.681]  Because they're all trendies.
[03:21:29.681 --> 03:21:31.642]  And it was just normal.
[03:21:31.642 --> 03:21:33.343]  And so, starts hacking them in the face.
[03:21:33.343 --> 03:21:44.988]  And then we'll go to the article, as we show this video, and show the folks in the hospital with the huge hatchet cuts into their eyes and noses and faces.
[03:21:44.988 --> 03:21:45.888]  Like, hey, how's it going?
[03:21:45.888 --> 03:21:47.669]  What's going on?
[03:21:47.669 --> 03:21:48.149]  Oh, really?
[03:21:48.149 --> 03:21:50.710]  A girl that I asked out didn't go out with me.
[03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:51.731]  And so I'm a protected group.
[03:21:53.075 --> 03:21:54.056]  I'm going to attack you!
[03:22:14.332 --> 03:22:14.972]  This is wrong.
[03:22:14.972 --> 03:22:19.435]  You need to spend the rest of your life in prison.
[03:22:19.435 --> 03:22:21.217]  And again, the clip, boom!
[03:22:21.217 --> 03:22:23.138]  Full power axe in the head.
[03:22:23.138 --> 03:22:28.962]  Talk about swinging like a boy for attacking that trendy.
[03:22:28.962 --> 03:22:33.145]  And the left said, read the transcript, said, this is allowed.
[03:22:33.145 --> 03:22:35.846]  We're going to have sex with your kids.
[03:22:35.846 --> 03:22:38.588]  We're going to put fluoride in your water.
[03:22:38.588 --> 03:22:42.351]  Because folks have got to think they're going to get somewhere great if they chemically sterilize.
[03:22:43.373 --> 03:22:45.334]  Doesn't look like that guy chemically sterilized.
[03:22:45.334 --> 03:22:48.716]  Maybe he was injecting some testosterone.
[03:22:48.716 --> 03:22:50.237]  Mike Adams is taking over.
[03:22:50.237 --> 03:22:53.519]  I promise to get all the calls if they took 10 calls.
[03:22:53.519 --> 03:22:55.180]  They put 20-something on the board.
[03:22:55.180 --> 03:22:58.221]  I got to 17 of them, or 16 of them.
[03:22:58.221 --> 03:23:04.065]  But Chris, and Chris, and Joseph, you have my word that I'll give you double the time tomorrow on the same subject.
[03:23:04.065 --> 03:23:05.606]  If you give us your name and number, I will call you.
[03:23:05.606 --> 03:23:07.647]  But all three of them get a free t-shirt.
[03:23:07.647 --> 03:23:08.787]  So please give us your info.
[03:23:08.787 --> 03:23:09.428]  We'll send that to you.
[03:23:12.486 --> 03:23:15.968]  By the way, T-shirts, by the way, are about to sell out.
[03:23:15.968 --> 03:23:20.990]  Some of the best-selling ones, like the Space Shuttle 1776 Space Force shirt.
[03:23:20.990 --> 03:23:21.671]  That's a limited edition.
[03:23:21.671 --> 03:23:22.791]  We're not printing more of those.
[03:23:22.791 --> 03:23:24.692]  We'll have a new design coming out that's similar but different.
[03:23:24.692 --> 03:23:31.876]  And then we also have the last of the three designs that's another collector's edition of the Betsy Ross flag.
[03:23:31.876 --> 03:23:35.138]  We have that lower third we can put up for folks there so they can see that.
[03:23:35.138 --> 03:23:40.221]  These are great-looking shirts, and they fund our operation.
[03:23:41.092 --> 03:23:47.518]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[03:23:47.518 --> 03:23:52.462]  And we have this big World Awakens sale.
[03:23:52.462 --> 03:23:54.424]  It's an extension of the big Mega Sale.
[03:23:54.424 --> 03:23:56.966]  Just some of the items were sold out and some items are close to selling out.
[03:23:56.966 --> 03:24:01.470]  So instead of all the items being 50% off or more, we have a bunch of them off.
[03:24:01.470 --> 03:24:02.751]  That's going to have to end the new documentary.
[03:24:02.751 --> 03:24:04.052]  You can't watch this, and I'm in.
[03:24:04.052 --> 03:24:04.853]  It's really good.
[03:24:04.853 --> 03:24:06.354]  We've got McGinnis, Paul Joseph, Watson, Laura
[03:24:06.374 --> 03:24:07.115]  We're good to go.
[03:24:25.649 --> 03:24:28.650]  You've covered the hundreds of studies on nationalnews.com like no other.
[03:24:28.650 --> 03:24:30.791]  I think you've been the number one on that.
[03:24:30.791 --> 03:24:35.332]  All the scientists, all the toxicologists, the FDA scientists saying get fluoride out.
[03:24:35.332 --> 03:24:43.435]  Why suddenly with this new JAMA study that it's hurting boys more than ever, causing massive IQ reductions, why suddenly are people saying we're vindicated?
[03:24:43.435 --> 03:24:48.237]  Because I know if I'm getting these calls, you own a big lab that tests this stuff, you're getting more calls than I'm getting.
[03:24:48.237 --> 03:24:50.818]  I mean, are you getting the vindication calls?
[03:24:50.818 --> 03:24:51.438]  And why now?
[03:24:51.438 --> 03:24:53.159]  Because this is just one of hundreds of studies.
[03:24:54.175 --> 03:24:57.437]  That's right, my phone's been blowing up too about the publication of this article.
[03:24:57.437 --> 03:25:03.200]  But look, you know Alex, you are 20 years ahead of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
[03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:10.905]  So, number one, where is the national apology to InfoWars and Natural News and all the others in independent media who have covered this, right?
[03:25:10.905 --> 03:25:12.106]  Because we've been warning about this.
[03:25:12.546 --> 03:25:13.508]  For over two decades.
[03:25:13.508 --> 03:25:15.490]  I know you in particular, Alex, you were ahead of this.
[03:25:15.490 --> 03:25:19.876]  I mean, you were covering this in the 1990s and warning people about it.
[03:25:19.876 --> 03:25:26.785]  And, you know, of course, they just call everybody a conspiracy theory until one day suddenly it's in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
[03:25:26.785 --> 03:25:28.527]  Oh, you were right the whole time.
[03:25:29.148 --> 03:25:36.294]  But the other part of this... And by the way, we're just right because it's on its face, but you're actually an engineer and scientist and you have scientists working for you.
[03:25:36.294 --> 03:25:42.740]  We specifically said it targets boys, African-Americans even more, and that it's causing bone cancer as well and lowering IQ.
[03:25:42.740 --> 03:25:46.143]  And exactly what we've been saying is exactly what they found.
[03:25:46.143 --> 03:25:49.106]  And they said it's a very stringent, in-depth, very deep study.
[03:25:50.339 --> 03:25:52.941]  Well, I'm going to add to that also today.
[03:25:52.941 --> 03:25:53.802]  You're exactly right.
[03:25:53.802 --> 03:25:59.507]  But I've got another study here just published from Christopher Exley, a researcher in the UK.
[03:25:59.507 --> 03:26:07.134]  Prescription infant formulas are intentionally contaminated with aluminum, another neurotoxic.
[03:26:07.134 --> 03:26:08.115]  And guess what?
[03:26:08.115 --> 03:26:15.201]  The formulas that are marketed to prevent asthma and for sensitive babies, they have the most aluminum in them.
[03:26:15.481 --> 03:26:16.923]  And let's stop right there.
[03:26:16.923 --> 03:26:18.965]  This is an admitted eugenics program.
[03:26:18.965 --> 03:26:27.014]  The Bayer documents came out 12 years ago that they knew HIV was in their factor VIII product on purpose and they said, well, we're getting rid of hemophiliacs.
[03:26:27.014 --> 03:26:28.695]  So these are very cold-blooded people.
[03:26:28.695 --> 03:26:30.097]  Can you speak to the mindset?
[03:26:30.097 --> 03:26:31.518]  The key is this is on purpose.
[03:26:32.737 --> 03:26:45.350]  Yeah, well, actually what I'm going to do today is connect the dots about how this is a war on not just humanity, but you notice that all of these vectors that are attacking people, they tend to attack young black males.
[03:26:45.350 --> 03:26:48.973]  This is a eugenics war on young black males.
[03:26:48.973 --> 03:26:55.240]  So vaccines cause autism at much higher rates in young black male infants, right?
[03:26:55.240 --> 03:26:56.261]  And then, of course,
[03:26:57.001 --> 03:27:00.423]  Not only do vaccines have aluminum, but then the infant formula has aluminum.
[03:27:00.423 --> 03:27:04.005]  And now we know that fluoride attacks males more than females as well.
[03:27:04.005 --> 03:27:07.347]  And then, of course, we have abortion and infanticide.
[03:27:07.347 --> 03:27:21.194]  And I say the number one target right now of the establishment, which is the science establishment, the medical establishment, the abortion industry, and the globalists, is that they want to mass murder black people everywhere around the world.
[03:27:21.194 --> 03:27:23.375]  And as I'll mention, I'll cover today how this goes back
[03:27:23.915 --> 03:27:27.396]  Decades when they wanted to put infertility chemicals into the food supply.
[03:27:27.396 --> 03:27:29.036]  By the way, this is not your opinion.
[03:27:29.036 --> 03:27:38.678]  When they set up the eugenics boards, the city health departments, that was set up under the eugenicists and racial hygiene.
[03:27:38.678 --> 03:27:43.699]  And so that's why the left puts out all this race stuff saying, oh, if you want blacks to be successful, you're a racist.
[03:27:43.699 --> 03:27:46.720]  They want blacks under their control so they never saw what hit them.
[03:27:47.816 --> 03:27:53.422]  Well yeah, and they absolutely remember that the attack on neurology is an attack on human freedom.
[03:27:53.422 --> 03:28:02.851]  And they, the globalists in the establishment, they want especially, they want black people to be neurologically damaged so they can be easily controlled by people like Mad Maxine.
[03:28:03.431 --> 03:28:19.464]  I mean, they want to be able to control black populations to force-feed them disinformation and hate to whip up race wars all over America while they're forcing black people to live in poverty and rat-infested liberal cities that are collapsing all around them.
[03:28:19.464 --> 03:28:20.485]  They want the brain damage.
[03:28:21.045 --> 03:28:26.389]  Alex, this is a modern day chemical weapons plantation enforcement system.
[03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:27.490]  It's nothing less than that.
[03:28:27.490 --> 03:28:28.450]  That's it.
[03:28:28.450 --> 03:28:30.572]  Blacks particularly targeted.
[03:28:30.572 --> 03:28:36.636]  They've done studies too, like they find in these city water supplies that the mainly black areas suddenly have higher levels.
[03:28:36.636 --> 03:28:37.516]  They don't know why.
[03:28:37.516 --> 03:28:39.378]  No, they're adding more to hit them.
[03:28:39.378 --> 03:28:44.181]  Oh, but you'll never hear Mad Maxine talk about that because she's a plantation owner.
[03:28:44.181 --> 03:28:47.683]  She's a house slave to kill the black people, literally.
[03:28:47.683 --> 03:28:50.005]  Planned Parenthood set up to kill black people as well.
[03:28:52.011 --> 03:28:53.993]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:53.993 --> 03:28:59.298]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:28:59.298 --> 03:29:00.880]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:00.880 --> 03:29:09.248]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:09.248 --> 03:29:14.934]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:15.114 --> 03:29:16.916]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:16.916 --> 03:29:19.099]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:19.099 --> 03:29:23.605]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:23.605 --> 03:29:25.787]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[03:30:52.373 --> 03:31:05.544]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[03:31:05.544 --> 03:31:08.466]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:31:08.466 --> 03:31:10.228]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:31:10.228 --> 03:31:13.871]  And we've seen massive increases in polls, support for the president.
[03:31:14.511 --> 03:31:19.055]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:31:19.055 --> 03:31:20.117]  That's beautiful.
[03:31:20.117 --> 03:31:21.998]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:31:21.998 --> 03:31:23.620]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:31:23.620 --> 03:31:31.207]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:31:31.207 --> 03:31:33.529]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:31:33.529 --> 03:31:37.713]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:31:37.713 --> 03:31:38.654]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:31:39.435 --> 03:31:43.543]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[03:31:43.543 --> 03:31:44.645]  We are the resistance.
[03:31:44.645 --> 03:31:45.367]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[03:31:52.987 --> 03:32:08.897]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:32:08.897 --> 03:32:10.598]  It is completely independent of all that.
[03:32:10.598 --> 03:32:21.484]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[03:32:21.704 --> 03:32:22.224]  We're good to go.
[03:32:41.596 --> 03:32:43.698]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:04.767 --> 03:33:09.376]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order.
[03:33:09.376 --> 03:33:13.203]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:33:16.785 --> 03:33:25.650]  Black Americans have every right to be beyond angry at the generations of chemical assaults that have been waged against them, heavy metals assault.
[03:33:25.650 --> 03:33:31.632]  But, you know, it's not right to be angry just at least like in a Black Lives Matter kind of way.
[03:33:31.632 --> 03:33:39.196]  The real enemies of Black America are the science establishment, the dental industry, the medical industry.
[03:33:39.196 --> 03:33:41.337]  And that's what I'm going to explain here in this segment.
[03:33:41.337 --> 03:33:42.678]  They are literally trying to
[03:33:43.504 --> 03:33:47.286]  Annihilate, to mass murder black people all across America.
[03:33:47.286 --> 03:33:54.390]  And if they can't murder you, they want to damage your brains, to cause confusion, to cause lowered IQs.
[03:33:54.390 --> 03:33:57.292]  They want to kill your babies or convince you to kill your own babies.
[03:33:57.292 --> 03:33:59.473]  This is what's going on.
[03:33:59.473 --> 03:34:11.580]  This all begins with, of course, the big breaking news, Journal of the American Medical Association, a pediatric version of that, talking about how, of course, fluoride now is known to lower the IQs of children.
[03:34:12.452 --> 03:34:15.955]  Especially affecting males more than females.
[03:34:15.955 --> 03:34:24.301]  When women are pregnant, that's the study, and they consume fluoride, then it damages the brains of the developing babies.
[03:34:24.301 --> 03:34:25.722]  The unborn babies.
[03:34:25.722 --> 03:34:38.953]  Now, if that baby survives the abortion advocates that want to mass murder everything that's born alive, by the way, then that baby will go on to suffer extreme brain damage or lowered IQs depending on their level of exposure.
[03:34:38.953 --> 03:34:40.614]  Now, the establishment doesn't stop at that.
[03:34:41.449 --> 03:34:49.162]  Remember, this is a massive chemical weapons assault on all humans, but especially African Americans.
[03:34:49.162 --> 03:34:50.484]  And I guess Africans all around the world.
[03:34:52.714 --> 03:34:57.737]  Well, they want to put mercury fillings in the mouths of black children.
[03:34:57.737 --> 03:34:59.178]  The dental industry pushes that.
[03:34:59.178 --> 03:35:04.541]  The same dental industry that pushes the fluoride, they also push mercury fillings.
[03:35:04.541 --> 03:35:06.522]  Of course, they don't call them mercury, right?
[03:35:06.522 --> 03:35:11.124]  They call them silver or amalgam, but they're about 50% mercury.
[03:35:11.124 --> 03:35:15.807]  Mercury is another neurotoxin, just like fluoride is a neurotoxin.
[03:35:15.807 --> 03:35:16.867]  And guess what?
[03:35:16.867 --> 03:35:20.709]  Black children get more mercury fillings than white children.
[03:35:20.709 --> 03:35:21.170]  You know why?
[03:35:21.815 --> 03:35:31.118]  Because dentists have a slogan, especially in inner cities, where it's all paid by insurance or, you know, Medicaid or Medicare type of coverage.
[03:35:31.118 --> 03:35:35.779]  They call it drill, fill and bill.
[03:35:35.779 --> 03:35:48.222]  It's about billing the government for as much money as you can by drilling and filling as many holes as you can create sometimes or diagnose in the teeth of young inner city black children.
[03:35:48.222 --> 03:35:49.883]  And so they drill, fill and bill.
[03:35:50.635 --> 03:35:54.607]  They drill, and then they fill it with mercury, and then they bill the government.
[03:35:54.607 --> 03:35:58.618]  So this is another mass poisoning that's taking place, especially of low-income...
[03:35:59.392 --> 03:36:04.637]  Black Americans in the inner cities, and dentists are making a killing doing that in the inner cities.
[03:36:04.637 --> 03:36:18.469]  By the way, there's also a huge cancer industry that makes money off of black people in inner cities, like Detroit, for example, where there are massive cancer scams, where they falsely diagnose every black person with cancer, even when they don't have it.
[03:36:18.469 --> 03:36:23.713]  In fact, one doctor, Dr. Fareed Fattah, was actually arrested by the FBI
[03:36:24.634 --> 03:36:37.406]  Charged, prosecuted, and I think he's in prison for 24 years or something like that because he ran a massive cancer scam giving chemotherapy to black people who didn't even have cancer.
[03:36:37.406 --> 03:36:38.667]  That was his scam.
[03:36:38.667 --> 03:36:42.491]  And of course targeting black people in order to accomplish that.
[03:36:42.491 --> 03:36:43.692]  So let's see.
[03:36:43.692 --> 03:36:48.457]  We've got chemotherapy targeting black people.
[03:36:48.457 --> 03:36:49.698]  It's also aluminum.
[03:36:50.487 --> 03:37:00.811]  So, there's a new study that just came out, I promised to bring in today, it's called Prescription Infant Formulas Are Contaminated With Aluminum.
[03:37:00.811 --> 03:37:05.133]  The spelling is British, so it's aluminium, if you're looking for that online.
[03:37:05.942 --> 03:37:08.963]  And it's by Christopher Exley and other researchers.
[03:37:08.963 --> 03:37:13.745]  This was published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.
[03:37:13.745 --> 03:37:20.127]  And it shows, of course, that these prescription infant formulas are loaded with aluminum.
[03:37:20.127 --> 03:37:28.751]  And in fact, there's more aluminum in the formulas that are determined to be of use to infants who have allergies.
[03:37:28.751 --> 03:37:32.172]  So sensitive infants are subjected to more aluminum.
[03:37:32.921 --> 03:37:34.763]  Then, the regular infant formulas.
[03:37:34.763 --> 03:37:35.804]  So this just came out.
[03:37:35.804 --> 03:37:38.286]  Aluminum is neurotoxic, by the way.
[03:37:38.286 --> 03:37:42.309]  So why are they putting it into infant formulas to feed to babies?
[03:37:42.309 --> 03:37:47.134]  And these are prescription formulas that are prescribed by doctors, okay?
[03:37:47.134 --> 03:37:51.097]  Now, on top of that, you've got aluminum in the vaccines.
[03:37:51.097 --> 03:37:58.343]  Now, aluminum in vaccines, of course, is another neurotoxic chemical on top of the mercury in vaccines.
[03:37:58.343 --> 03:37:59.925]  Are you starting to see a pattern here?
[03:38:00.689 --> 03:38:08.036]  And they want the black babies especially to get vaccinated with as many injections at the youngest age possible.
[03:38:08.036 --> 03:38:12.300]  Even though a whistleblower who worked for the CDC, I think he's still there.
[03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:36.278]  A top scientist at the CDC blew the whistle a couple years ago, went public, posted a statement with his attorney saying that he was part of a massive scientific cover-up at the CDC where they covered up the evidence that vaccines cause autism at much higher rates in black babies compared to white babies or non-black babies.
[03:38:36.278 --> 03:38:39.561]  There were other races and origins involved in the study as well.
[03:38:40.548 --> 03:38:48.496]  I think it was 420% increase among African-American infants, but I'd have to double check and make sure that statistic is correct.
[03:38:48.496 --> 03:38:51.358]  In any case, it's a substantial increase.
[03:38:51.358 --> 03:38:54.321]  So now we know that vaccines are targeting black babies.
[03:38:54.321 --> 03:38:58.004]  We know infant formula is targeting all babies with aluminum.
[03:38:58.004 --> 03:39:00.827]  We know that the fluoride
[03:39:01.468 --> 03:39:17.729]  Is a specially toxic to male babies and then we've got cities like Detroit where they deliberately altered the pH of the water in the public water supply to release a massive amount of aluminum in the water supply that feeds
[03:39:18.630 --> 03:39:21.332]  The black community there that provides tap water.
[03:39:21.332 --> 03:39:32.719]  It had over a hundred parts per million of lead in the tap water at certain times because the City Council decided to alter the water source and change the pH.
[03:39:32.719 --> 03:39:38.142]  Now this, my friends, this is a war on humanity.
[03:39:38.142 --> 03:39:44.006]  It is a chemical weapons, multi-layered, multi-vector warfare system.
[03:39:44.955 --> 03:39:53.589]  And the warfare system is designed to damage the neurology of human beings because that is the new enslavement.
[03:39:53.589 --> 03:39:55.713]  Understand why this is so crucial.
[03:39:56.678 --> 03:40:02.582]  And share all of this with everybody you know who might find this relevant and interesting.
[03:40:02.582 --> 03:40:07.325]  And you can even say, hey, look, there's this white guy scientist talking about how black babies are being targeted.
[03:40:07.325 --> 03:40:08.206]  Yeah, it's true.
[03:40:08.206 --> 03:40:09.426]  I did a whole talk on this.
[03:40:09.426 --> 03:40:13.549]  It's called the Science Agenda to Exterminate Blacks.
[03:40:13.549 --> 03:40:14.510]  I did a whole lecture on it.
[03:40:14.510 --> 03:40:17.552]  It's out there on brighteon.com, I think, still, if you want to see it.
[03:40:17.552 --> 03:40:19.593]  But this is all about
[03:40:20.396 --> 03:40:33.787]  Destroying the neurology to cause mental IQ damage to the establishment is trying to make people, especially black people, incapable of questioning their slavery.
[03:40:33.787 --> 03:40:36.569]  This is modern day neurological slavery.
[03:40:36.569 --> 03:40:39.231]  This is the scientific plantation.
[03:40:39.938 --> 03:40:52.349]  To keep you on that plantation instead of chopping off a foot like they would do to a slave in the old days, they chop off part of your brain with a chemical lobotomy and heavy metals so you can't question your reality.
[03:40:52.349 --> 03:41:03.298]  You can never rise up and escape the liberal city traps that they have you trapped in and tell you to keep voting for Democrats who keep you enslaved in the same system of poverty and destitution.
[03:41:03.958 --> 03:41:11.706]  And literal chemically induced mental retardation of your children and mass abortion of your children because you are black.
[03:41:11.706 --> 03:41:14.669]  This is what's happening in America today and this is run by Democrats.
[03:41:14.669 --> 03:41:17.052]  This is run by the scientific establishment.
[03:41:17.052 --> 03:41:24.379]  This is run by the vaccine industry, the dental industry, the medical industry, the psychiatric drugging of black children.
[03:41:24.379 --> 03:41:25.400]  This is genocide.
[03:41:26.030 --> 03:41:31.591]  And it is taking place in America today, and it has nothing to do with the slavery that was ended over a hundred years ago.
[03:41:31.591 --> 03:41:35.652]  This is a whole new modern-day chemical weapons slavery system.
[03:41:35.652 --> 03:41:40.493]  And it's in operation right now, and it's run by Democrats and the scientific establishment.
[03:41:40.493 --> 03:41:45.734]  And we, we the independent media, we've been sounding the alarm on this for decades.
[03:41:45.734 --> 03:41:47.654]  Alex Jones warned you about this.
[03:41:47.654 --> 03:41:49.615]  I warned you about this.
[03:41:49.615 --> 03:41:52.155]  Natural News, we all warned about this.
[03:41:52.155 --> 03:41:55.596]  We've been warning about this for a couple of decades, if not more.
[03:41:56.522 --> 03:42:05.070]  And we were silenced and we were censored and Google gave all the links to the media that said, oh, there's no problem with fluoride.
[03:42:05.070 --> 03:42:06.371]  Fluoride doesn't damage anything.
[03:42:06.371 --> 03:42:07.693]  There's no problem with heavy metals.
[03:42:07.693 --> 03:42:09.474]  There's no problem with aluminum.
[03:42:09.474 --> 03:42:11.036]  There's no problem with vaccines.
[03:42:11.036 --> 03:42:13.198]  They were all fake news.
[03:42:13.198 --> 03:42:18.643]  But we were the ones that got banned because we dared to speak up.
[03:42:19.588 --> 03:42:22.870]  For the victims of this massive chemical assault.
[03:42:22.870 --> 03:42:30.393]  Do you realize that if you dump fluoride into the water supply right now, you would be arrested for chemical terrorism?
[03:42:30.393 --> 03:42:34.675]  And yet every city across America has been doing it for decades.
[03:42:34.675 --> 03:42:35.376]  Why?
[03:42:35.376 --> 03:42:37.156]  Why are they getting away with that?
[03:42:37.156 --> 03:42:43.539]  Where are the arrests of those city officials who mass poisoned their people with fluoride in the water?
[03:42:43.539 --> 03:42:44.440]  Important questions.
[03:42:44.440 --> 03:42:46.481]  We'll be back with more here on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:51.564 --> 03:42:57.287]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[03:42:57.287 --> 03:42:58.327]  Alpha Power.
[03:42:58.327 --> 03:43:01.789]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[03:43:38.843 --> 03:43:42.904]  Show the world what a True Alpha Male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[03:43:42.904 --> 03:43:45.385]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:43:52.296 --> 03:44:08.851]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[03:44:08.971 --> 03:44:13.075]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[03:44:13.075 --> 03:44:16.758]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[03:44:16.758 --> 03:44:18.500]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[03:44:18.500 --> 03:44:22.744]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[03:44:22.744 --> 03:44:30.671]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[03:44:30.691 --> 03:44:33.394]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[03:44:33.394 --> 03:44:38.300]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[03:44:38.300 --> 03:44:39.482]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[03:44:39.482 --> 03:44:40.483]  They have side effects.
[03:44:40.483 --> 03:44:41.384]  Not with Mother Nature.
[03:44:41.384 --> 03:44:45.068]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[03:44:45.068 --> 03:44:46.971]  InfoWareStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:52.611 --> 03:45:05.782]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[03:45:05.782 --> 03:45:08.705]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[03:45:08.705 --> 03:45:10.466]  farming goods a week ago.
[03:45:10.466 --> 03:45:14.110]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[03:45:14.750 --> 03:45:19.292]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[03:45:19.292 --> 03:45:20.332]  That's beautiful.
[03:45:20.332 --> 03:45:22.233]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[03:45:22.233 --> 03:45:23.834]  And we aren't going to back down.
[03:45:23.834 --> 03:45:31.437]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[03:45:31.437 --> 03:45:33.758]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[03:45:33.758 --> 03:45:37.939]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:45:37.939 --> 03:45:38.860]  And I'm asking listeners,
[03:45:39.660 --> 03:45:43.765]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[03:45:43.765 --> 03:45:44.866]  We are the resistance.
[03:45:44.866 --> 03:45:45.507]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[03:45:53.127 --> 03:45:55.529]  Without your support, we won't be here.
[03:45:55.529 --> 03:45:59.071]  And I couldn't thank you all enough for the fact that you've kept us in the game.
[03:45:59.071 --> 03:46:00.552]  I mean, I want to stay in this game.
[03:46:00.552 --> 03:46:01.853]  I want to take the gloveless on.
[03:46:01.853 --> 03:46:03.814]  Total transparency is our whole operation.
[03:46:03.814 --> 03:46:08.998]  If I bring in $35 million, half of that's the cost of the products, because we don't mark stuff up that much.
[03:46:08.998 --> 03:46:11.840]  I don't care if I'm not making money, but you need to buy the products.
[03:46:11.940 --> 03:46:12.661]  We got coffee.
[03:46:12.661 --> 03:46:13.542]  We got fish oil.
[03:46:13.542 --> 03:46:14.343]  We got turmeric.
[03:46:14.343 --> 03:46:15.324]  We got great toothpaste.
[03:46:15.324 --> 03:46:17.728]  We've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[03:46:17.728 --> 03:46:20.371]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[03:46:20.371 --> 03:46:22.994]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil.
[03:46:22.994 --> 03:46:24.476]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[03:46:24.476 --> 03:46:26.839]  And it is the strongest, purest krill oil.
[03:46:26.839 --> 03:46:28.682]  And it cost us three times more.
[03:46:28.902 --> 03:46:33.604]  Because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[03:46:33.604 --> 03:46:39.407]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[03:46:39.407 --> 03:46:41.649]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[03:46:41.649 --> 03:46:42.589]  This is not real.
[03:46:42.589 --> 03:46:47.211]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest quality krill oil you're gonna find anywhere.
[03:46:47.211 --> 03:46:48.812]  Real krill oil, folks, is red.
[03:46:48.812 --> 03:46:50.373]  It's not yellow, it's not milky.
[03:46:50.373 --> 03:46:55.175]  This is nothing but krill oil.
[03:46:55.175 --> 03:46:57.757]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:06.124 --> 03:47:08.526]  Waging War on Corruption.
[03:47:08.526 --> 03:47:13.930]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:47:13.930 --> 03:47:19.013]  You know, it's always an honor to be here and to be able to bring you this information.
[03:47:19.013 --> 03:47:24.237]  And yeah, I get angry about the war on humanity.
[03:47:24.237 --> 03:47:35.045]  I get angry and I express that openly when I see the organized mass murder of babies and entire races.
[03:47:35.925 --> 03:47:42.126]  Are targeted for extermination right now on our planet and it's all it's in your face now.
[03:47:42.126 --> 03:47:43.827]  It's not a hidden agenda.
[03:47:43.827 --> 03:47:44.947]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[03:47:44.947 --> 03:47:45.987]  It's all out in the open.
[03:47:45.987 --> 03:47:52.609]  I mean, you've got now the mainstream saying water filters are bad that you're supposed to drink maximum poison.
[03:47:52.609 --> 03:48:02.091]  How dare you filter your water and have clean water and protect your brain from fluoride or arsenic or toxic heavy metals or pesticides that might be in your water.
[03:48:02.091 --> 03:48:03.091]  How dare you filter that?
[03:48:03.755 --> 03:48:07.337]  You're supposed to drink the poisons that they have prescribed for you.
[03:48:07.337 --> 03:48:09.377]  That's out in the open now.
[03:48:09.377 --> 03:48:10.338]  Water filters are bad.
[03:48:10.338 --> 03:48:12.539]  They say carbon dioxide is bad.
[03:48:12.539 --> 03:48:15.700]  I mean, carbon dioxide is bad?
[03:48:15.700 --> 03:48:27.405]  It's the number one most important nutrient for every plant on Earth that grows the food, that grows the herbs, all the seeds, all the fruits and vegetables, everything grown because of carbon dioxide.
[03:48:28.174 --> 03:48:29.115]  Photosynthesis.
[03:48:29.115 --> 03:48:30.015]  Chlorophyll.
[03:48:30.015 --> 03:48:34.358]  I mean, go back to, you know, Science 101 in high school.
[03:48:34.358 --> 03:48:35.458]  Chlorophyll.
[03:48:35.458 --> 03:48:36.299]  Photosynthesis.
[03:48:36.299 --> 03:48:37.300]  This is how plants live.
[03:48:37.300 --> 03:48:38.000]  Carbon dioxide.
[03:48:38.000 --> 03:48:42.423]  But the insane, delusional, anti-human left says carbon dioxide's bad.
[03:48:42.423 --> 03:48:44.664]  And they have to get rid of carbon dioxide.
[03:48:45.687 --> 03:48:47.007]  They say organics are all bad.
[03:48:47.007 --> 03:48:48.148]  They say nutrition is bad.
[03:48:48.148 --> 03:48:51.029]  Google's now banning natural health websites.
[03:48:51.029 --> 03:48:54.130]  Google's banning information that promotes organics.
[03:48:54.130 --> 03:49:01.252]  If you speak out against GMOs, against vaccines, against pesticides, against heavy metals, you are now censored.
[03:49:01.252 --> 03:49:03.832]  Because Google wants you to be poisoned.
[03:49:03.832 --> 03:49:12.875]  Because Google is so evil, it is part of this massive chemical assault, multi-layered, multi-vectored system to destroy humanity.
[03:49:13.763 --> 03:49:17.385]  And in order to do that, they have to destroy information first, and they have to destroy free speech.
[03:49:17.385 --> 03:49:20.467]  But just understand, this is all out in the open now.
[03:49:20.467 --> 03:49:27.752]  You are supposed to eat your poison, and you're supposed to like it, and you're supposed to worship your slave masters.
[03:49:27.752 --> 03:49:30.353]  That's the message from the system.
[03:49:30.353 --> 03:49:33.395]  How dare you try to have clean food and clean water.
[03:49:33.395 --> 03:49:36.477]  And I tell you, it's so insane.
[03:49:36.477 --> 03:49:40.640]  I'm even going to quote here from none other than Piers Morgan.
[03:49:40.640 --> 03:49:42.201]  Yes, Piers Morgan.
[03:49:42.901 --> 03:49:51.605]  Former CNN host, Piers Morgan, even though he's a crazy gun control nut, he's starting to get it about how insane liberals are.
[03:49:51.605 --> 03:49:54.026]  And there's a video of him out there today.
[03:49:54.026 --> 03:49:59.148]  He says, populism is rising because liberals have become unbearable.
[03:49:59.148 --> 03:50:00.909]  This is Piers Morgan again.
[03:50:00.909 --> 03:50:06.912]  The same Piers Morgan that interviewed Alex Jones a few years ago and was condemning Jones.
[03:50:06.912 --> 03:50:07.712]  Piers Morgan says,
[03:50:08.493 --> 03:50:10.014]  I speak as a liberal.
[03:50:10.014 --> 03:50:15.458]  Liberals have become utterly, pathetically illiberal, and it's a massive problem.
[03:50:15.458 --> 03:50:19.441]  What's the point of calling yourself a liberal if you don't allow anyone else to have a different view?
[03:50:19.441 --> 03:50:27.487]  This snowflake culture we operate in, this victimhood culture that everyone has to think a certain way, everyone has to have a bleeding heart.
[03:50:27.487 --> 03:50:32.051]  You say a joke ten years ago that offended somebody, you can never host the Oscars?
[03:50:32.051 --> 03:50:32.491]  He goes on.
[03:50:33.348 --> 03:50:36.550]  He says people are fed up with the snowflake, libtard culture, basically.
[03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:38.431]  This is what Piers Morgan is saying now.
[03:50:38.431 --> 03:50:38.971]  Hey, guess what?
[03:50:38.971 --> 03:50:41.292]  Piers Morgan is starting to get it.
[03:50:41.292 --> 03:50:43.073]  It's insane.
[03:50:43.073 --> 03:50:49.556]  The insanity has become the face of the Democrat Party and the face of everything that the left does.
[03:50:49.556 --> 03:50:55.879]  And this is why more and more people who didn't even vote for Trump in 2016 are now coming out in support of Trump.
[03:50:55.879 --> 03:50:57.640]  People are seeing what's happening to the Democrats.
[03:50:57.640 --> 03:50:59.621]  They're like, these people are insane.
[03:51:00.896 --> 03:51:04.658]  And this has implications on economics and the stock market, too.
[03:51:04.658 --> 03:51:07.280]  This is going to blow you away.
[03:51:07.280 --> 03:51:10.562]  You've probably heard of this company called WeWork, right?
[03:51:10.562 --> 03:51:12.443]  WeWork is about to go public.
[03:51:12.443 --> 03:51:22.089]  And they've issued some kind of report before going public that's being characterized as a quote, masterpiece of obfuscation.
[03:51:22.757 --> 03:51:29.003]  Now, WeWork is one of these virtue-signaling, liberal, left-wing IPOs.
[03:51:29.003 --> 03:51:32.687]  And there are a bunch of these now where they really don't have much of a business model.
[03:51:32.687 --> 03:51:34.549]  They don't do anything special.
[03:51:34.549 --> 03:51:36.951]  They really don't offer much to the world.
[03:51:36.951 --> 03:51:39.874]  I mean, WeWork just basically rents office space to people.
[03:51:39.874 --> 03:51:45.120]  But then they claim, we're going to raise consciousness and we're going to have consciousness capital.
[03:51:45.834 --> 03:51:51.539]  And we're going to change the world with this consciousness and our unique technology, which doesn't even exist.
[03:51:51.539 --> 03:51:54.561]  There's nothing unique about a database and a spreadsheet, by the way.
[03:51:54.561 --> 03:51:55.762]  That's not unique.
[03:51:55.762 --> 03:51:58.044]  I mean, an online reservation system, really?
[03:51:58.044 --> 03:51:59.666]  Airlines had that in the 1980s.
[03:51:59.666 --> 03:52:01.447]  That's not new.
[03:52:01.447 --> 03:52:02.428]  By the way, it's not new at all.
[03:52:02.975 --> 03:52:13.658]  But these young millennials are investing in companies like WeWork or Uber or other similar companies, even Tesla, because of the narrative.
[03:52:13.658 --> 03:52:15.279]  Oh, it's all virtue signaling.
[03:52:15.279 --> 03:52:17.059]  Oh, we're going to save the planet.
[03:52:17.059 --> 03:52:18.400]  We're going to change the world.
[03:52:18.400 --> 03:52:20.160]  We're going to raise consciousness.
[03:52:20.160 --> 03:52:22.561]  We're going to have consciousness capital.
[03:52:22.561 --> 03:52:25.002]  Or sometimes they call it conscious capitalism.
[03:52:26.087 --> 03:52:27.748]  But it's all BS.
[03:52:27.748 --> 03:52:30.069]  Because most of these companies don't make money.
[03:52:30.069 --> 03:52:31.030]  They all lose money.
[03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:33.211]  I mean, almost all of them lose money all the time.
[03:52:33.211 --> 03:52:35.372]  This is burning through investor money.
[03:52:35.372 --> 03:52:39.334]  They don't offer anything really unique to the world.
[03:52:39.334 --> 03:52:41.295]  Now, by the way, I'm not shorting any of these companies.
[03:52:41.295 --> 03:52:42.876]  I'm not saying this out of my own self-interest.
[03:52:42.876 --> 03:52:45.738]  I don't... I'm not even in the stock market.
[03:52:45.738 --> 03:52:46.838]  I buy gold, okay?
[03:52:46.838 --> 03:52:48.559]  I buy physical gold.
[03:52:48.559 --> 03:52:49.360]  That's what I do.
[03:52:49.360 --> 03:52:51.441]  And ammunition, things like that.
[03:52:51.441 --> 03:52:52.821]  I'm not in the market.
[03:52:52.821 --> 03:52:54.703]  So, you know, get your own financial advice.
[03:52:54.703 --> 03:52:55.343]  But the point is,
[03:52:56.388 --> 03:53:01.972]  The liberal millennial investors have never seen a stock market crash because they're too young.
[03:53:01.972 --> 03:53:06.536]  And they're throwing all this money into these companies because they want a virtue signal.
[03:53:06.536 --> 03:53:08.437]  Oh, we invested in WeWork.
[03:53:08.437 --> 03:53:10.539]  We bought some Tesla stock.
[03:53:10.539 --> 03:53:12.320]  We bought some Uber stock.
[03:53:12.320 --> 03:53:13.801]  And they want to feel good.
[03:53:13.801 --> 03:53:15.543]  Well, guess what?
[03:53:15.543 --> 03:53:23.949]  These companies, I believe, in my assessment, are going to catastrophically crash one day worse than the original dot-com crash of 2000-2001.
[03:53:25.788 --> 03:53:26.889]  It's going to be catastrophic.
[03:53:26.889 --> 03:53:36.255]  A lot of these companies will lose 99% of their value like Dr. Coop did back in the first dot-com crash, which I also warned about, by the way, in 1998 and 1999.
[03:53:36.255 --> 03:53:39.898]  And these liberals, for the first time, they're going to see all their savings wiped out.
[03:53:39.898 --> 03:53:41.859]  And they're going to start to wonder, well, wait a minute.
[03:53:41.859 --> 03:53:44.701]  I thought that we did all the right things for virtue.
[03:53:44.701 --> 03:53:45.902]  I thought this was ethical.
[03:53:45.902 --> 03:53:47.683]  I thought we were saving the planet.
[03:53:47.683 --> 03:53:52.266]  No, you're investing in a lunatic left-wing scheme that doesn't make money and just burns cash.
[03:53:53.220 --> 03:54:07.724]  And, you know, the amazing thing about the free market is that if there are public investors who want to put money into bad ideas, the market will create companies based on bad ideas that will gladly consume their money.
[03:54:07.724 --> 03:54:08.924]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[03:54:08.924 --> 03:54:11.465]  It's a lesson in basic economics.
[03:54:11.465 --> 03:54:14.586]  Leftists create demand for bad ideas.
[03:54:14.586 --> 03:54:15.126]  So what do you know?
[03:54:15.126 --> 03:54:21.908]  There are all these companies that are based on bad ideas that are going to gladly take that liberal money and burn it and just obliterate it.
[03:54:22.449 --> 03:54:28.591]  And one day, and it's coming, one day all these liberals are going to say, where'd all the money go?
[03:54:28.591 --> 03:54:29.011]  Guess what?
[03:54:29.011 --> 03:54:31.151]  It went into a black hole of virtue signaling.
[03:54:31.151 --> 03:54:32.432]  That's where it went.
[03:54:32.432 --> 03:54:34.712]  And by the way, don't forget about Theranos.
[03:54:34.712 --> 03:54:39.754]  So Theranos was another company led by Elizabeth Holmes, who's now facing criminal charges.
[03:54:39.754 --> 03:54:44.055]  Theranos, they claimed they were going to change the world with a drop of blood from your finger.
[03:54:44.055 --> 03:54:45.615]  They were going to miniaturize 250 analytical blood tests.
[03:54:48.129 --> 03:54:49.890]  And they were going to have blood tests of everybody.
[03:54:49.890 --> 03:55:00.098]  In your home, a little device that you just put your finger in it and it takes a little drop of blood and you can tell what's going on with your heart and diabetes and all these biomarkers.
[03:55:00.098 --> 03:55:01.839]  It's going to change the world.
[03:55:01.839 --> 03:55:03.861]  Except the whole thing was a fraud.
[03:55:03.861 --> 03:55:06.302]  She made it all up.
[03:55:06.302 --> 03:55:09.225]  900 million dollars blown away.
[03:55:09.225 --> 03:55:11.266]  Billions of dollars in valuation gone.
[03:55:11.266 --> 03:55:14.328]  The company was actually disbanded last year.
[03:55:14.328 --> 03:55:16.270]  And then criminally charged, I think, by the DOJ.
[03:55:17.887 --> 03:55:22.368]  But it had a great story all along and a lot of people invested in it.
[03:55:22.368 --> 03:55:24.168]  She's going to change the world.
[03:55:24.168 --> 03:55:26.209]  She's an entrepreneurial woman.
[03:55:26.209 --> 03:55:29.510]  She's a leader of our community and she has heart.
[03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:31.290]  She's got feelings.
[03:55:31.290 --> 03:55:33.330]  That's what people are investing in.
[03:55:33.330 --> 03:55:35.171]  And they're going to lose every time.
[03:55:35.171 --> 03:55:37.951]  And they did lose every time when it came to Theranos.
[03:55:37.951 --> 03:55:45.233]  So my word of caution in this is when you invest in something, or you buy stocks or anything,
[03:55:46.667 --> 03:55:47.667]  Make sure it makes sense.
[03:55:47.667 --> 03:55:48.548]  Be rational about it.
[03:55:48.548 --> 03:55:52.049]  Don't virtue-signal with your investment.
[03:55:52.049 --> 03:55:55.930]  And a lot of these corporations now, they're publicly saying that all they're going to do now is virtue-signal.
[03:55:55.930 --> 03:55:58.591]  They're going to push transgenderism, and they're going to push gun control.
[03:55:58.591 --> 03:56:00.811]  And they don't even care about profits anymore.
[03:56:00.811 --> 03:56:01.311]  Guess what?
[03:56:01.311 --> 03:56:03.472]  Eventually, all those companies will go bankrupt.
[03:56:04.531 --> 03:56:08.113]  Because they've stopped functioning as a rational business.
[03:56:08.113 --> 03:56:10.455]  They've violated the laws of economics.
[03:56:10.455 --> 03:56:18.059]  According to analysts, by the way, and I haven't looked at this personally, but some analysts say General Electric is massively overstating its earnings.
[03:56:18.059 --> 03:56:20.620]  Some analysts say Disney is in trouble.
[03:56:20.620 --> 03:56:23.842]  Some analysts say, of course, Tesla is in big trouble.
[03:56:25.279 --> 03:56:30.601]  Not only do their cars spontaneously explode into balls of flame, maybe the company might do that one day.
[03:56:30.601 --> 03:56:31.281]  Who knows?
[03:56:31.281 --> 03:56:32.922]  I mean, it's so crazy.
[03:56:32.922 --> 03:56:38.063]  I get the feeling if Elon Musk bumps his head on a stairwell, he might spontaneously burst into flame.
[03:56:38.063 --> 03:56:39.264]  Who knows?
[03:56:39.264 --> 03:56:42.185]  JP Morgan may be in so much trouble.
[03:56:42.185 --> 03:56:50.768]  They actually owned the ship that was busted carrying a billion dollars worth of cocaine busted in the port of Philadelphia.
[03:56:50.768 --> 03:56:51.848]  JP Morgan owned the ship.
[03:56:52.714 --> 03:56:56.996]  Can you say banks and money laundering and drug trafficking?
[03:56:56.996 --> 03:56:57.996]  Yeah.
[03:56:57.996 --> 03:56:59.777]  Look at the history of HSBC.
[03:56:59.777 --> 03:57:01.577]  Look at the history of JPMorgan.
[03:57:01.577 --> 03:57:05.679]  And you'll come to understand maybe what's really powering the financial system right now.
[03:57:05.679 --> 03:57:07.380]  Because it's not rationality.
[03:57:07.380 --> 03:57:14.983]  A lot of it is just fraud, corruption and, you know, fake promotions of things that won't work long term.
[03:57:14.983 --> 03:57:15.983]  So be cautious, people.
[03:57:16.977 --> 03:57:26.705]  Make your own decisions, get informed, but be cautious and keep tuning in to InfoWars.com where you'll get the real story on economics with other guests like Gerald Cilenti and many others.
[03:57:26.705 --> 03:57:28.847]  The War Room is coming up next with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:28.847 --> 03:57:30.088]  I always thank you for joining me.
[03:57:30.088 --> 03:57:32.370]  This is Mike Adams here at the Health Ranger.
[03:57:32.370 --> 03:57:35.513]  Stay tuned for Owen and, you know, take care of yourself.
[03:57:35.513 --> 03:57:36.334]  Be careful.
[03:57:36.334 --> 03:57:37.054]  Crazy world out there.
[03:57:37.054 --> 03:57:37.655]  Thanks for watching.
