[00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.961]  It's Thursday, May 16, 2019.
[00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.622]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:18.346]  President Trump is going to lose in 2020 big time unless he takes action on four critical areas immediately.
[00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:25.149]  After this important report from Mark Dice, I'll lay it all out when we kick off the second segment of this live transmission.
[00:00:25.209 --> 00:00:30.672]  But first, Trump is starting to make some major progress on one of the big fronts, and that's censorship.
[00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:31.693]  Here's Mark Dice.
[00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:42.401]  Well, the good news is the White House just released a new tool for people to submit detailed reports about being censored on social media, including what the post was about and what platform it was on.
[00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:50.142]  But the bad news is, at least as of now, there is no direct link to the form on the White House official website.
[00:00:50.422 --> 00:00:58.184]  Hopefully that'll change very soon, and I'm gonna tweet to Dan Scavino, the White House Social Media Manager, and let him know that the main page is missing a link to the form.
[00:00:58.484 --> 00:01:14.154]  So for now, if you go to whitehouse.gov slash tech bias, it'll take you to this page, which reads, social media platforms should advance freedom of speech, yet too many Americans have seen their accounts suspended, banned, or fraudulently reported for unclear, quote, violations of user policies.
[00:01:14.454 --> 00:01:21.437]  No matter your views, if you suspect political bias caused such an action to be taken against you, share your story with President Trump.
[00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:35.983]  It then takes you to a page where you can fill out your personal details that explain what happened, and best of all, submit screenshots that the social media company sent to you about the particular post that was banned or the account that they took down.
[00:01:36.303 --> 00:01:46.409]  Well, as soon as I'm done recording this video, I think I'm gonna have to let the president know that Instagram censored this Jussie Smollett Scooby-Doo meme about who was really behind the supposed crime.
[00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:54.714]  Good thing I saved a screenshot of the notification they sent me, too, telling me my post had been deleted because it was bullying Jussie Smollett.
[00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:55.775]  It was bullying him.
[00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:03.538]  And look at this, in the notifications that Instagram sends you when they take down your posts, they actually blur the very post in the notification.
[00:02:03.898 --> 00:02:07.879]  But if you just look closely at it, you can obviously tell that's the post that it was.
[00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:25.525]  I'm also gonna have to let them know that Facebook suspended me for a week after I criticized the Dove Soap Company's commercial featuring real moms when they included a transgender woman in the ad with her new baby and she identified as the child's mom.
[00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.547]  We are both his biological parents.
[00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:30.189]  You get people that are like, what do you mean you're the mom?
[00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.052]  We're like, yep, we're both gonna be moms.
[00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:45.966]  Yes, just saying that it's abnormal that this biological man who identifies as a woman also identifies as his new baby's mother is considered to be hate speech on Facebook.
[00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:48.308]  I'm sorry, but you're not that poor baby's mother.
[00:02:48.608 --> 00:02:50.169]  Two plus two does not equal five.
[00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:54.052]  I don't care what the big tech companies say or what the Supreme Court has ruled.
[00:02:54.273 --> 00:02:55.674]  You can't tell me what to think.
[00:02:56.194 --> 00:03:01.218]  Oh, and then there was the time Twitter suspended me for calling Kevin Spacey a scumbag and telling him to go to hell.
[00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:03.160]  That was bullying a poor gay man.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:15.610]  And speaking of censorship, YouTube did remove the video of the 14-year-old child prodigy Soph from her channel where she dressed up as a Muslim and denounced political correctness and social justice warriors.
[00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.734]  This video has been removed for violating YouTube's policy on hate speech.
[00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:34.126]  The video had been up on her channel I think for several weeks and had about a quarter million views until BuzzFeed's Joe Bernstein, a social media hall monitor, published this article calling for her to be banned from YouTube.
[00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:41.430]  On his Twitter feed, he says, I've been covering this stuff for a while now, and Soph's videos are among the most shocking things that I've ever seen.
[00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.194]  I don't think you could watch this stuff without concluding there's a moral crisis at YouTube.
[00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:51.636]  The good news is, Soph is approaching a million subscribers because of all the new publicity.
[00:03:51.656 --> 00:03:58.801]  The bad news is, I think she's locked out of her account for two weeks because of the strikes, and who knows how much longer YouTube will even allow her to have a channel.
[00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:07.967]  They don't want a 14-year-old child prodigy who denounces political correctness, feminism, and censorship on social media to have a voice on social media.
[00:04:08.308 --> 00:04:25.500]  Meanwhile, the liberal media like the New York Times and Good Morning America are celebrating the 11-year-old drag kid, an 11-year-old boy whose parents dress him up in drag and take him to gay bars where he does simulated strip teases while men throw dollar bills at him.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.883]  I'm not going to show you that video because it's beyond horrifying, but here he is on Good Morning America being celebrated for being amazing.
[00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:46.748]  And while YouTube recently disabled the comments on all kids' videos because a bunch of pedos were hanging out in the comments section, of course they still allow the comments section to be active on Desmond is Amazing's channel.
[00:04:46.928 --> 00:04:48.088]  Alright, great job Mark Dice.
[00:04:48.108 --> 00:04:51.450]  Full report up on InfoWars.com and of course MarkDice.com.
[00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.990]  Get ready when we come back.
[00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.611]  If Trump doesn't do four things,
[00:04:55.563 --> 00:05:01.704]  He's going to lose in 2020, and so are we big time, stalling our populist global revolution.
[00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:16.047]  This is next level, breaking ground, history book level, science fiction dystopia, tyranny on steroids.
[00:05:47.528 --> 00:05:49.669]  Just take the red pill, people!
[00:05:58.493 --> 00:06:01.195]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:05.819]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:06.660]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.381]  Alex Jones.
[00:06:07.501 --> 00:06:10.523]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones.
[00:06:10.543 --> 00:06:19.971]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign by changing its algorithm to bury stories like the Clinton body count story.
[00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:21.793]  That's according to website InfoWars.
[00:06:21.893 --> 00:06:25.716]  It's confirmed there are at least two shooters with fully automatic weapons.
[00:06:27.108 --> 00:06:31.231]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:31.731]  J.F.
[00:06:31.831 --> 00:06:34.533]  King was shot from the back and the front.
[00:06:34.553 --> 00:06:38.775]  It was almost as if he were a plant imploded with just pancakes.
[00:06:38.835 --> 00:06:42.838]  They took the babies out of pinkie bears and left the children to die on the cross.
[00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:46.153]  I think this is a national security error.
[00:06:46.373 --> 00:06:49.654]  We have clear things that we do not understand how they work.
[00:06:50.295 --> 00:06:53.416]  Operating in areas that we can't control.
[00:06:53.776 --> 00:06:54.656]  UFOs.
[00:06:54.756 --> 00:06:56.757]  Is this global governance at last?
[00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:57.858]  Is it one world?
[00:06:57.918 --> 00:06:59.318]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:01.299]  Israel claims the attack was accidental.
[00:07:01.579 --> 00:07:04.841]  But some former US naval officers say it was on purpose.
[00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:08.202]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover-up.
[00:07:08.382 --> 00:07:13.908]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[00:07:13.968 --> 00:07:15.269]  Russian scum!
[00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:16.330]  He denied everything.
[00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.832]  He called it all fake news.
[00:07:17.852 --> 00:07:20.735]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:22.737]  This is a national emergency.
[00:07:22.757 --> 00:07:28.483]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[00:07:28.543 --> 00:07:30.605]  This is a female high-level election.
[00:07:31.265 --> 00:07:33.666]  We are at war with Russia.
[00:07:34.106 --> 00:07:39.408]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and Wikileaks?
[00:07:39.748 --> 00:07:42.509]  The White House and the President are citing InfoWars.
[00:07:42.809 --> 00:07:44.589]  They can shut us down, you're next!
[00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:49.511]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:52.032]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:07:54.694 --> 00:07:56.555]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[00:07:56.635 --> 00:08:01.398]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[00:08:01.438 --> 00:08:05.021]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:09.103]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[00:08:09.203 --> 00:08:12.225]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[00:08:12.345 --> 00:08:19.449]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:20.070]  Dangerous.
[00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.650]  Dangerous.
[00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:21.191]  Dangerous.
[00:08:21.231 --> 00:08:21.711]  Dangerous.
[00:08:22.371 --> 00:08:23.492]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:08:23.512 --> 00:08:24.652]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:08:24.712 --> 00:08:27.314]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[00:08:27.354 --> 00:08:30.015]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[00:08:31.776 --> 00:08:32.797]  They call me dangerous.
[00:08:32.937 --> 00:08:34.358]  Danger is my middle name.
[00:08:34.558 --> 00:08:36.399]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:39.880]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:42.542]  This is about the total rollout.
[00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.603]  For complete and total censorship.
[00:08:44.663 --> 00:08:46.063]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:08:46.343 --> 00:08:50.845]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:53.426]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[00:08:53.646 --> 00:08:55.507]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:57.848]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[00:08:58.408 --> 00:09:00.729]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:01.870]  I want them shut down.
[00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:02.830]  I want them silenced.
[00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.510]  I want them muted.
[00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.551]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:06.972]  I want them shut down!
[00:09:07.412 --> 00:09:08.573]  I want them silenced!
[00:09:08.653 --> 00:09:09.433]  I want them muted!
[00:09:09.533 --> 00:09:12.795]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:23.661]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery services aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[00:09:23.681 --> 00:09:32.386]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:33.206]  Screw your rules.
[00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:36.769]  Your rules go against our values and they are patently un-American.
[00:09:36.849 --> 00:09:39.431]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.573]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:09:43.814 --> 00:09:46.635]  We need a digital Bill of Rights.
[00:09:46.655 --> 00:09:50.318]  They're becoming the public square and they control how we interact with each other.
[00:09:50.538 --> 00:09:57.883]  And if you think that you're going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem.
[00:09:57.943 --> 00:09:58.884]  You are a bad person.
[00:09:58.924 --> 00:10:00.705]  You should be censored off the internet.
[00:10:00.745 --> 00:10:00.965]  Bad?
[00:10:01.005 --> 00:10:01.105]  Yes.
[00:10:01.185 --> 00:10:02.426]  Get out of here, Alex.
[00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:07.130]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:16.056]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[00:10:16.397 --> 00:10:20.460]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:10:40.017 --> 00:10:42.298]  What an exciting time to be alive, my friends.
[00:10:42.318 --> 00:10:45.760]  It's Thursday, May 16, 2019.
[00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:48.482]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:10:49.302 --> 00:10:52.785]  We're going to be here for the next four hours live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:10:53.265 --> 00:10:56.687]  And of course, Owen Schroer with The War Room is coming up right after that.
[00:10:56.747 --> 00:10:58.088]  David Knight is here.
[00:10:59.148 --> 00:11:00.389]  Weekday mornings from 8 a.m.
[00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:02.250]  to 11 a.m., right before I go live.
[00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.292]  We are live on this Thursday Global Edition.
[00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:19.724]  Well, if you go to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com, every day when the show goes live, we post an article that has a live video and audio feed in it that really encapsulates what the top story, at least at the start of the show, is.
[00:11:20.665 --> 00:11:25.686]  And that is the fact that President Trump is going to lose in 2020 if
[00:11:37.847 --> 00:11:43.738]  He doesn't do four things that absolutely need to happen.
[00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:49.849]  And so I tend to cover really important issues here, just kind of throw them out there.
[00:11:53.223 --> 00:11:57.204]  Then he gets mixed in with all the other news and information, so I'm gonna wait till the next segment.
[00:11:57.245 --> 00:11:58.565]  I'm gonna lay these four things out.
[00:11:59.205 --> 00:12:00.786]  We've already talked about these four things a lot.
[00:12:00.806 --> 00:12:02.046]  I'm sure you'll agree with these four things.
[00:12:02.827 --> 00:12:05.568]  And I intend to open the phones up and say, are there other things you'd like to add?
[00:12:05.608 --> 00:12:08.989]  Because I'm gonna shoot a special report this weekend.
[00:12:10.353 --> 00:12:15.034]  To the President with graphics and documentation that I know we'll end up getting to the President.
[00:12:15.615 --> 00:12:17.775]  He likes five minute long briefings.
[00:12:18.715 --> 00:12:37.741]  And we're going to get it into his hands dealing with the massive, unparalleled, just incredible, amazing levels of criminal activity going on in this country.
[00:12:39.628 --> 00:12:48.653]  And really the fact that if he thinks the revolution to overturn his election was serious, he ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:12:51.174 --> 00:12:52.035]  And neither have we.
[00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:59.899]  So I'm going to do my best to lay that out and then get to all the other news.
[00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:08.684]  We come back and I'm going to open the phones up today to get your specific take on what you think needs to happen in 2020 and what curveballs you think
[00:13:09.704 --> 00:13:13.161]  The establishment are going to be throwing.
[00:13:14.648 --> 00:13:24.090]  I'm gonna try to be as calm as I can, because once I plunge into the news and information, I get in a hurry to try to cover every facet, and I tend to miss the forest for the trees, as we all know.
[00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.351]  But this is really, really critical information that's coming up.
[00:13:29.012 --> 00:13:35.493]  So however you're listening, however you're watching, please get others to tune in, because it's vital this information get out.
[00:13:36.113 --> 00:13:38.374]  The establishment wants us off air for a reason.
[00:13:38.674 --> 00:13:41.395]  They know we've got their number and know how to defeat them.
[00:13:41.895 --> 00:13:42.095]  Okay.
[00:13:43.547 --> 00:13:46.969]  That said, also, we are listener-supported.
[00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.693]  You have seen the unprecedented, draconian attempts to destroy us.
[00:13:53.473 --> 00:13:58.196]  Only your word of mouth has overcome their attempts to block our transmissions.
[00:13:58.816 --> 00:14:04.240]  Only the support of our great AM and FM affiliates, as well, and your diligence out there, spreading the word.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.484]  But also, financially, you hear radio stations have sponsors, and the GCN network we're on has some sponsors, but
[00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:12.692]  That's not what funds our operation.
[00:14:12.792 --> 00:14:18.958]  It's you directly buying products at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:14:19.979 --> 00:14:21.501]  And we make it very, very easy.
[00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:26.145]  We have the best supplements, the best vitamins, the best nutraceuticals out there you're going to find.
[00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:26.506]  Period.
[00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:32.592]  And we have great books and films and t-shirts and a lot of other important
[00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:34.882]  Information.
[00:14:35.602 --> 00:14:42.608]  And it's just an ongoing fight to keep this place afloat in the face of what the establishment has been trying to do.
[00:14:42.668 --> 00:14:43.930]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.710]  I'm not a victim.
[00:14:45.231 --> 00:14:45.891]  We're targets.
[00:14:46.892 --> 00:14:54.919]  And so I would just encourage everyone to understand that just like our information is game changing and accurate and over the horizon radar.
[00:14:56.004 --> 00:14:58.625]  The products we've got are amazing as well.
[00:14:59.165 --> 00:15:00.825]  I mean, just take our Wake Up America coffee.
[00:15:01.045 --> 00:15:02.445]  I think it's the best coffee I ever had.
[00:15:02.465 --> 00:15:09.227]  I thought that I could get it organic, wild harvested from Southern Mexico, right on the Guatemala border from the Chiapas people.
[00:15:09.947 --> 00:15:11.207]  And we've been selling it for 10 years.
[00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:12.788]  It's super popular.
[00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:18.369]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for $5 to $10 more a pound.
[00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:22.650]  So, Wake Up America coffee at infowarestore.com.
[00:15:26.806 --> 00:15:31.328]  And you just sign up for AutoShip every 15 days, every month, every two months.
[00:15:31.348 --> 00:15:32.049]  You just click a button.
[00:15:32.089 --> 00:15:32.869]  It comes whenever you want.
[00:15:32.909 --> 00:15:34.690]  You cancel any time, get an additional 10% off.
[00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.392]  It has 800 reviews on Power Reviews, a 4.9.
[00:15:38.913 --> 00:15:42.875]  No other coffee has that on Power Reviews.
[00:15:42.895 --> 00:15:43.815]  98% review.
[00:15:45.836 --> 00:15:47.797]  98% review, 4.9 stars.
[00:15:48.418 --> 00:15:50.639]  Wake Up America Coffee, two different types.
[00:15:50.659 --> 00:15:51.759]  There's also the Immune Boost.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.281]  And then you just support the broadcast, get great coffee.
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:16:02.687]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:16:17.597 --> 00:16:23.942]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[00:16:24.043 --> 00:16:26.004]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[00:16:26.885 --> 00:16:31.349]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[00:16:32.209 --> 00:16:37.094]  But then you add, not to the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there,
[00:16:37.802 --> 00:16:38.183]  Literally.
[00:16:38.923 --> 00:16:49.677]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the tumeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[00:16:50.498 --> 00:16:54.463]  Now, Ultimate Bone Broth can be gulped down with water or milk or however you want to.
[00:16:54.783 --> 00:16:55.904]  The taste is okay.
[00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:59.387]  But when you mix it with whey or other things and some fruit, it tastes great.
[00:16:59.947 --> 00:17:03.730]  What I like to do is just put a scoop in, mix it with milk, bang it back.
[00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:10.074]  And whether it's for meal replacement, whether it's for post-workout, pre-workout, our Ultimate Bone Broth Formula is amazing.
[00:17:10.754 --> 00:17:15.037]  It's 50% off right now at InformalRestore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[00:17:15.437 --> 00:17:17.919]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:24.463]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that has taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[00:17:25.183 --> 00:17:28.368]  Now, this is high quality and it's very thick, so doing it with a spoon takes a while.
[00:17:28.388 --> 00:17:29.770]  That's why I like to use a blender.
[00:17:31.412 --> 00:17:37.281]  Again, I love it with milk.
[00:17:38.282 --> 00:17:39.364]  Just bang this baby back.
[00:17:46.684 --> 00:17:47.824]  Nothing like it for a meal replacement.
[00:17:47.844 --> 00:17:49.525]  It's way beyond any way you've ever had.
[00:17:49.545 --> 00:17:55.707]  Again, it's got the essence of the bones, the chaga mushroom, the turmeric, a bunch of other incredible stuff.
[00:17:56.168 --> 00:17:58.849]  This is what fuels patriots.
[00:17:58.869 --> 00:18:00.509]  This is what fuels people that really want to be healthy.
[00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:02.870]  It's ultimate bone broth at mfortworthlife.com.
[00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:10.093]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:18:11.425 --> 00:18:14.248]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:18:14.768 --> 00:18:17.350]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:18:17.871 --> 00:18:19.052]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:18:19.412 --> 00:18:25.438]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:18:25.978 --> 00:18:28.781]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[00:18:29.841 --> 00:18:32.883]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:18:33.183 --> 00:18:35.784]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:18:36.104 --> 00:18:37.345]  That sends chills up my spine.
[00:18:37.805 --> 00:18:51.073]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:18:51.353 --> 00:18:53.294]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[00:18:53.934 --> 00:18:58.766]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:18:59.207 --> 00:19:01.654]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[00:19:04.065 --> 00:19:04.365]  E.T.
[00:19:04.605 --> 00:19:05.546]  on in Texas.
[00:19:05.826 --> 00:19:07.808]  You're on the air.
[00:19:07.868 --> 00:19:08.888]  Go ahead.
[00:19:08.908 --> 00:19:09.589]  Greetings.
[00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:09.989]  Welcome.
[00:19:34.325 --> 00:19:37.566]  And I hope to hear from you again, and I will always keep in touch with you all.
[00:19:37.706 --> 00:19:38.926]  God bless you, Etion.
[00:19:39.086 --> 00:19:40.207]  I never plug Icarin.
[00:19:40.307 --> 00:19:43.888]  All we do is go out and see what is the best product already out there, and then make it even stronger and better.
[00:19:43.908 --> 00:19:44.888]  What has the best ratings.
[00:19:44.908 --> 00:19:48.329]  So for kidney and liver, Icarin as a flush, it's powerful.
[00:19:48.369 --> 00:19:51.070]  But if you're already in a weird state, consult a physician.
[00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.311]  A lot of companies have a bunch of marketing, but they sell kind of filler because they're scared of real supplements.
[00:19:55.331 --> 00:20:00.272]  I mean, real supplements can really help you, but also, you know, if you're in a weird place, you can get crazy.
[00:20:00.292 --> 00:20:01.713]  So Icarin and InfoWareStore.com.
[00:20:06.484 --> 00:20:09.083]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:48.876]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:53.218]  Alex Jones here on this Thursday, May 16, 2019 broadcast.
[00:20:53.238 --> 00:20:56.100]  We've got some really important, informative guests today.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.822]  I intend to open the phones up starting in the next segment.
[00:20:58.842 --> 00:21:00.883]  I'll give the number out and so much more.
[00:21:03.145 --> 00:21:16.013]  But let me right now lay out four big pillars that if the president doesn't act decisively on these, he doesn't have a hope, he doesn't have a prayer, he doesn't have a chance in hell.
[00:21:16.897 --> 00:21:17.257]  Of course.
[00:21:40.984 --> 00:21:41.744]  I mean, the jig's up.
[00:21:42.345 --> 00:21:50.969]  The general population, other talk show hosts, understand the real paradigm of deep state, global governance, who the players are, what the philosophies are.
[00:21:51.549 --> 00:21:53.770]  So there's no really putting that genie back in the bottle.
[00:21:54.211 --> 00:21:57.532]  I don't want to say we've outlived our usefulness, but let's just say this.
[00:21:57.812 --> 00:22:05.316]  This audience supporting us, helping us relaunch Americana, real politique, how the world really works, has changed the world.
[00:22:06.537 --> 00:22:07.977]  And so, I salute all of you.
[00:22:08.418 --> 00:22:08.958]  Now that said,
[00:22:11.112 --> 00:22:25.993]  It's up to us now to just keep hammering this to the President, keep hammering this to Congress, and more and more members of the House, more members of the Senate, are saying exactly what we're saying, because what we're saying is common sense.
[00:22:27.756 --> 00:22:37.845]  But most people, even good conservatives in Congress, get caught up in the tar babies of the topics and the subjects that mainstream corporate media puts out.
[00:22:38.465 --> 00:22:41.568]  And so we get sucked in to their fantasy lands.
[00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:45.611]  Instead of looking at the facts.
[00:22:45.651 --> 00:22:47.793]  So, here's the four pillars and I'll walk through them.
[00:22:49.174 --> 00:22:51.276]  Number one is communications.
[00:22:52.637 --> 00:22:54.198]  And election integrity.
[00:22:54.338 --> 00:22:55.980]  So I'll call that one pillar.
[00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:05.634]  Communications of the American people, the capacity to communicate, beyond just free speech, just communications.
[00:23:08.076 --> 00:23:25.106]  And that ties into election integrity and the Democrats' long history of election meddling and the fact that they've been caught in the last election doing it and have been trying to overturn this election and are now involved in draconian level censorship at a level never before seen in the world.
[00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:30.875]  Big Tech at the behest of the Democrats in Deep State has outstripped anything the Chi-Coms have even done yet.
[00:23:30.895 --> 00:23:34.758]  And of course, I'm the test case, along with a few others.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:37.261]  So that's where we are right now.
[00:23:37.341 --> 00:23:45.689]  If the President doesn't act on censorship and on massive manipulation,
[00:23:46.877 --> 00:23:49.378]  He will have the 2020 election stolen.
[00:23:49.418 --> 00:23:50.699]  There's no doubt he's going to win.
[00:23:51.059 --> 00:23:52.760]  All the numbers show landslide.
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:56.561]  He had a landslide in 2016.
[00:23:56.621 --> 00:24:06.405]  We predicted a landslide, but I said the wave is going to be partially blocked by a seawall of fraud and people voting in the names of the dead and fake polls.
[00:24:06.465 --> 00:24:10.307]  So it's got to be a massive tsunami to make it over the seawall.
[00:24:10.447 --> 00:24:11.107]  It barely did.
[00:24:11.127 --> 00:24:14.729]  I mean, some CNN polls they were sampling
[00:24:17.485 --> 00:24:19.687]  30 plus points for Democrats against Trump.
[00:24:19.747 --> 00:24:21.748]  And so, of course, Hillary was winning by 67%.
[00:24:22.869 --> 00:24:26.231]  It was to create that bandwagon effect, that giant fraud effect.
[00:24:26.532 --> 00:24:29.554]  On average, they were sampling 15 points more for Democrats.
[00:24:29.574 --> 00:24:31.255]  I remember the day of the election.
[00:24:31.315 --> 00:24:32.996]  Why were the polls all wrong?
[00:24:33.196 --> 00:24:38.380]  Oh, they think two years later, soon to be four years later, you won't have a memory.
[00:24:40.256 --> 00:24:44.958]  So, Trump has to step up to the plate and fight the election.
[00:24:45.798 --> 00:24:47.399]  Fraud that's already unfolding.
[00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:49.120]  People voting the names of the dead.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.780]  The attacks on free speech.
[00:24:50.880 --> 00:25:00.745]  We've got to have communications and we've got to have real integrity in elections to block the feverish cheating and corruption we've already seen from the Democrats.
[00:25:02.505 --> 00:25:03.426]  So that's the number one pillar.
[00:25:03.626 --> 00:25:05.667]  Communications and the integrity of the election.
[00:25:05.707 --> 00:25:06.327]  I put that together.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.441]  And again, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, instant messaging.
[00:25:11.681 --> 00:25:15.922]  Now they want WhatsApp that helped the new leader of Brazil get elected.
[00:25:15.962 --> 00:25:18.643]  They don't want conservatives to be able to text person to person.
[00:25:19.803 --> 00:25:21.504]  They're having CNN investigative reports.
[00:25:21.744 --> 00:25:23.044]  Does Jones have one?
[00:25:23.324 --> 00:25:24.605]  Is he talking to people on it?
[00:25:25.005 --> 00:25:25.405]  Ban him!
[00:25:27.472 --> 00:25:31.093]  Because they know, as I've been saying for a year, text messages.
[00:25:31.593 --> 00:25:32.953]  Send out our articles on text messages.
[00:25:33.393 --> 00:25:34.834]  People open them way more often.
[00:25:35.154 --> 00:25:36.254]  It's what you get around the censors.
[00:25:36.294 --> 00:25:45.216]  Well, now they're trying to go in and saying, well, AT&T might block conservative tweets or conservative text or, oh, WhatsApp's already starting.
[00:25:47.077 --> 00:25:47.457]  It's here.
[00:25:48.357 --> 00:25:48.677]  Beyond 1984.
[00:25:49.497 --> 00:25:50.777]  So that's the number one pillar.
[00:25:51.818 --> 00:25:52.618]  And we'll flesh out
[00:25:53.851 --> 00:25:58.013]  What we think the president should do and some of the actions he's now taking when we come back.
[00:25:58.033 --> 00:25:59.394]  Let's get to the other three pillars quickly.
[00:26:01.254 --> 00:26:12.700]  Communications, integrity of election, the fact that most people communicate now over Facebook, over Twitter, over apps, which are being surveilled and controlled in real time.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:22.064]  So that's we've got to have integrity of just communications in this country for the people to communicate, for us to have our populous message win.
[00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:30.502]  Number two, and Trump's already taken action on this to a great extent, but you watch, the Federal Reserve is private, foreign-owned, it's going to sneak attack.
[00:26:31.462 --> 00:26:33.443]  The CHICOM's own, you know, part of it, basically.
[00:26:33.844 --> 00:26:34.804]  And now they're dumping U.S.
[00:26:34.824 --> 00:26:35.164]  Treasuries.
[00:26:35.204 --> 00:26:35.584]  That's good.
[00:26:35.764 --> 00:26:38.126]  They should just divest and, you know, get out of it.
[00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:38.906]  But we're in a real war.
[00:26:40.896 --> 00:26:45.337]  And there's going to be economic warfare trying to sabotage the economy ahead of the election.
[00:26:45.437 --> 00:26:46.077]  That's obvious.
[00:26:46.097 --> 00:26:46.778]  Trump knows that.
[00:26:47.198 --> 00:26:50.439]  He's already grabbed the establishment by the short hairs.
[00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:56.680]  He's already let them know that he understands what's happening and unfolding.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:02.742]  So they did eight hikes in interest rates in the first year of Trump.
[00:27:03.702 --> 00:27:04.242]  Year and a half.
[00:27:04.382 --> 00:27:05.943]  They never did one under Obama.
[00:27:07.059 --> 00:27:08.740]  And again, that was to kill this recovery.
[00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.583]  Once the economy got up to 4.8 percent, they totally panicked to drive it back down.
[00:27:14.704 --> 00:27:21.788]  Trump threatened to remove the leadership of the Federal Reserve and exercise power for the first time in 105 years over the private group that has the name federal.
[00:27:21.948 --> 00:27:23.169]  That's all that's federal about it.
[00:27:23.689 --> 00:27:24.710]  So they backed off for now.
[00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.451]  But he's got to secure the economy.
[00:27:26.931 --> 00:27:28.212]  He's got to stand up for the economy.
[00:27:28.552 --> 00:27:33.715]  And he's got to understand they're going to try other tricks, try to plunge the markets and other things to blame him ahead of 2020.
[00:27:35.336 --> 00:27:37.577]  That we're going to be in the thick of the campaign in just six months.
[00:27:38.137 --> 00:27:40.618]  So that's number two is secure the economy.
[00:27:40.918 --> 00:27:44.440]  Realize the alien globalist Federal Reserve will run sneak attacks.
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.701]  So we need to continue to laze them politically.
[00:27:48.061 --> 00:27:50.182]  Light them up with the spotlight so they know they're being watched.
[00:27:52.123 --> 00:27:54.484]  Then the president obviously has to secure the borders.
[00:27:55.902 --> 00:28:18.482]  And I kept saying declare a national emergency, but I meant a real national emergency as Commander-in-Chief, like Eisenhower did back in 1958, and actually secure the border when we have a collapsing border and we have hundreds of thousands a month getting caught coming in, we know of, overwhelming the courts, overwhelming ICE, and then they're releasing up to 10,000 every few days.
[00:28:19.103 --> 00:28:20.124]  That's a broken border.
[00:28:20.504 --> 00:28:21.665]  That's a collapsed country.
[00:28:22.606 --> 00:28:27.210]  And the American people, if you don't take decisive action, will know you've been involved in dereliction of duty.
[00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:28.811]  Okay, you got a few extra billion from the Pentagon.
[00:28:29.091 --> 00:28:31.594]  You're trying to put a Band-Aid on a leg that's cut off.
[00:28:32.214 --> 00:28:33.475]  You've got to put a tourniquet around it.
[00:28:33.976 --> 00:28:34.236]  Show.
[00:28:34.376 --> 00:28:35.937]  Defend the borders.
[00:28:36.558 --> 00:28:37.999]  Exercise executive power.
[00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:45.425]  Declare a real national emergency, not a law enforcement emergency on funding, a true national emergency under the Commander-in-Chief to defend our borders.
[00:28:45.945 --> 00:28:51.070]  And the fourth thing the President needs to do when we come back on the other side,
[00:28:52.165 --> 00:28:55.368]  Remember, the globalists work around the clock to stop these links going out.
[00:28:55.769 --> 00:28:56.450]  So get them out.
[00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.830]  NewsWords.com.
[00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:57.350]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:57.371 --> 00:28:57.851]  Stay with us.
[00:28:57.871 --> 00:29:00.634]  Why has America been so special compared to other nations?
[00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:10.790]  Why has it become the model of other successful countries?
[00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.571]  Why do so many people want to get here?
[00:29:13.312 --> 00:29:18.276]  Because of our constitutional republic and the basic freedoms that were protected for the individual.
[00:29:18.837 --> 00:29:25.062]  Even though we've had a lot of problems, the fact that we were the freest country in the world allowed incredible wealth to be developed.
[00:29:25.763 --> 00:29:27.486]  By the 1950s, the U.S.
[00:29:27.506 --> 00:29:33.054]  had over 80% of the world's patents and over half the wealth, and the biggest middle class the planet had ever seen.
[00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:37.781]  It was America that led the way on human rights, not just here, but around the world.
[00:29:38.666 --> 00:29:44.068]  But if you tune into the national news today, like CNN, you'd believe America was the worst place on Earth.
[00:29:44.489 --> 00:29:45.429]  And it's a horrible place.
[00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:46.389]  And why is that?
[00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:53.773]  It's because multinational corporations, working with the Communist Chinese, the EU and others, are demoralizing the nation to break us down.
[00:29:54.313 --> 00:29:58.095]  And to make us not care about our identity, so we can be absorbed into globalism.
[00:29:58.815 --> 00:30:07.197]  But thanks to InfoWars and thanks to the audience of activists out there, we have rebooted Americana and the resistance against the globalists.
[00:30:07.637 --> 00:30:11.638]  And now Trump coming in and turning the tide, exposing the whole fake Russiagate.
[00:30:11.998 --> 00:30:12.659]  Has them panicked.
[00:30:13.359 --> 00:30:18.140]  Nationalist populists are being elected in South America, in Europe, in the UK.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.640]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:30:20.001 --> 00:30:21.381]  And the power structure is panicking.
[00:30:22.205 --> 00:30:36.932]  That's why Big Tech, allied with the Chi-Coms, the authoritarian EU and others, are forcing the whole Hollywood, hate America, brainwashing on the public and bringing in censorship in an attempt to block us from completing the take back of the nation.
[00:30:37.392 --> 00:30:39.233]  And that's why, more than ever, you have to remember.
[00:30:39.653 --> 00:30:53.158]  Because of the censorship, you've got to come to NewsWars.com or InfoWars.com to hear what's really happening on the front lines and how you can help, not just save the country, but really the future destiny of the people of this planet.
[00:30:53.638 --> 00:31:02.862]  Because if the United States falls to tyranny and falls to leftist authoritarianism, the Communist Chinese will be the dominant cultural force on the planet.
[00:31:03.888 --> 00:31:18.758]  That's why it's so critical that we understand that Democrats in Congress right now are attempting to bring in more draconian censorship of conservatives and others, while at the same time big tech heads lie to Congress and say they're not censoring when they've been caught red-handed.
[00:31:19.784 --> 00:31:25.145]  This is the legislative branch, and we need to take control of it to restore the republic.
[00:31:25.425 --> 00:31:31.687]  We also have to take control of the judicial, and that takes us to our next spot, the Supreme Court.
[00:31:31.827 --> 00:31:34.768]  Imagine what would have happened if Hillary Clinton would have been elected.
[00:31:35.228 --> 00:31:45.050]  It would have been a death blow to this country, because the Democrats now officially say they want to repeal the Second Amendment, the right to keep and bear arms, and so many other issues.
[00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.671]  This nation is still held by a threat.
[00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:54.154]  That's why it's so important to understand that the Democrats are the party of extremism, extreme anti-Americanism.
[00:31:54.514 --> 00:32:01.379]  The Republicans were a bunch of blue blood establishment types, but we've had a populist insurrection that has partially taken it over.
[00:32:01.959 --> 00:32:13.567]  Now we've got to take it all the way over, keep Trump in the White House in 2020, and get more governorships and more state houses across this country to reverse the globalist plan to take down our nation.
[00:32:13.587 --> 00:32:15.468]  And that's why InfoWars is so important.
[00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:17.429]  InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:22.471]  Tomorrow's news today that will only get through to the people if you spread the word.
[00:32:23.572 --> 00:32:26.433]  Just while I've been out here walking today, I probably shook a hundred hands.
[00:32:27.133 --> 00:32:29.274]  And a third of them said, where are you?
[00:32:29.334 --> 00:32:30.214]  We miss you.
[00:32:30.814 --> 00:32:32.075]  We wish you were still on air.
[00:32:32.975 --> 00:32:37.577]  That's because they were habitualized on YouTube and on iTunes and everywhere else to listen to us.
[00:32:38.467 --> 00:32:41.248]  You have to come to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:32:41.289 --> 00:32:46.811]  And I know the regular listeners understand that, but other people kind of just passively watch what pops up on their screen.
[00:32:47.152 --> 00:32:52.634]  They love the truth, they love liberty, but they're not thinking that there's an internet outside of Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
[00:32:53.015 --> 00:32:55.576]  That's why you are how we outreach.
[00:32:55.696 --> 00:33:00.018]  You are how we get this information through the censors to others.
[00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:01.839]  You are the resistance.
[00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:02.960]  So God bless you all.
[00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:08.591]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.072 --> 00:33:29.114]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:33:29.894 --> 00:33:31.335]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:31.595 --> 00:33:32.696]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:33.256 --> 00:33:37.978]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:46.002 --> 00:33:47.222]  No brag, just fact.
[00:33:48.563 --> 00:33:52.325]  I am one of the earliest individuals, other than Ann Coulter,
[00:33:53.191 --> 00:33:56.813]  To predict that Donald Trump would become the nominee for president in 2016.
[00:33:58.094 --> 00:33:59.095]  I said that in 2015.
[00:33:59.595 --> 00:34:02.597]  And that he would end up winning the presidency.
[00:34:03.218 --> 00:34:06.460]  That there'd be a worldwide populist movement overriding the globalists.
[00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:14.885]  But isn't nationalism and free market and freedom a lot more popular than authoritarian globalism?
[00:34:14.905 --> 00:34:21.810]  I mean, I'm betting on humanity, but I could also basically see the tea leaves.
[00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:27.510]  And so, I've already covered, if you just joined us, the three pillars.
[00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:32.892]  But if you just tuned in, we've got to have communications for election integrity.
[00:34:33.973 --> 00:34:35.073]  If not, it's election meddling.
[00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:45.436]  And under that is the whole crisis of people voting in the names of the dead, which is an official democratic policy for 100 years, which is now done in an industrial organized scale.
[00:34:46.357 --> 00:34:46.757]  You got that?
[00:34:49.497 --> 00:34:50.758]  The Democrats are on a holy jihad.
[00:34:50.798 --> 00:34:52.299]  They admit they're engaged in fraud.
[00:34:52.519 --> 00:34:55.441]  They admit they're letting illegal aliens vote all over the country and all over the world.
[00:34:58.803 --> 00:35:01.765]  So we've got to have a stop to the censorship at least to fight back.
[00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:03.426]  We've got to be aware of election fraud.
[00:35:03.466 --> 00:35:06.729]  That all goes under communications.
[00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:17.456]  Then of course we've got
[00:35:18.885 --> 00:35:19.865]  The attack on the economy.
[00:35:21.046 --> 00:35:23.247]  That's got to be stopped by the private Federal Reserve.
[00:35:24.167 --> 00:35:25.208]  And Trump's done that so far.
[00:35:25.328 --> 00:35:26.088]  But they're going to come back.
[00:35:26.168 --> 00:35:26.788]  You better believe it.
[00:35:26.848 --> 00:35:27.368]  They always do.
[00:35:28.049 --> 00:35:29.349]  And then, of course, we've got the open borders.
[00:35:29.409 --> 00:35:43.855]  The fact that it's his job and his duty to put the regular military there and to turn these people back and not let them overwhelm our asylum system, which they're doing by design and let all these diseases and the rest of it pour in that the system admits is happening.
[00:35:44.796 --> 00:35:45.656]  And then there's the fourth one.
[00:35:47.665 --> 00:35:50.666]  I don't like Venezuelan dictator Maduro.
[00:35:50.826 --> 00:35:56.149]  I don't like the Shiite-Iranian dictatorship and the clerics.
[00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:59.330]  But that said, I don't trust John Bolton.
[00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:00.731]  I don't trust the neocons.
[00:36:01.251 --> 00:36:02.392]  I don't trust the Democrats.
[00:36:03.032 --> 00:36:05.893]  And war is very unpopular with the American people.
[00:36:06.874 --> 00:36:10.576]  Sure, it might be popular while the bombs are dropping.
[00:36:11.956 --> 00:36:13.477]  People historically will get behind it.
[00:36:15.179 --> 00:36:22.341]  But right away it really hurts the president, it hurts our military, it hurts the innocents that get killed in it.
[00:36:23.081 --> 00:36:26.582]  And a lot of times the problem that was already there gets a lot worse.
[00:36:27.183 --> 00:36:30.804]  Look at Iraq, look at Syria, look at Libya.
[00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:41.207]  And so one of the biggest threats to the Trump presidency and to America's reboot and restart is the neocons.
[00:36:42.298 --> 00:37:01.043]  Now I am very, very pleased that just today the White House and the President has come out and said, we don't want war with Iran, but we are going to have tough sanctions, and we don't think the time is right to strike Iran, countermanding some of the neocon propaganda coming out.
[00:37:02.283 --> 00:37:04.183]  Here's some of the stories up on InfoWars.com.
[00:37:04.503 --> 00:37:05.784]  This is from ZeroHedge.com.
[00:37:06.264 --> 00:37:09.385]  Iran's military on cusp of war.
[00:37:09.985 --> 00:37:10.445]  Close quote.
[00:37:11.934 --> 00:37:16.196]  As US allies pull troops from Iraq.
[00:37:17.917 --> 00:37:19.538]  Here's another one from Information Liberation.
[00:37:20.099 --> 00:37:20.799]  Washington Post.
[00:37:20.879 --> 00:37:30.144]  Trump, frustrated by advisors, is not convinced the time is right to attack Iran.
[00:37:30.785 --> 00:37:34.947]  Trump is not inclined to respond forcefully unless there is a big move.
[00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:39.011]  From the Iranians.
[00:37:39.091 --> 00:37:43.195]  Well, the Iranians are saying, we're not attacking Saudi Arabian ships.
[00:37:43.275 --> 00:37:45.097]  We're not attacking drones.
[00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:46.098]  These are false flags.
[00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:51.644]  I don't tend to believe anything comes out of the Iranians' mouth, but they don't want a war.
[00:37:52.284 --> 00:37:54.266]  Why would you then try to start one?
[00:37:56.789 --> 00:38:01.714]  Just like the last four chemical attacks in Syria, turned out our own government now admits
[00:38:03.055 --> 00:38:12.122]  Were false flags staged by ISIS and the so-called White Helmets to start a larger war and get us involved.
[00:38:14.684 --> 00:38:22.591]  Obviously, Obama signaled all of that when he said, well, there's any chemicals used, that's a red line, we're going in to take you out.
[00:38:22.991 --> 00:38:29.456]  So there's Assad winning all these years, finally completely won, thanks to Russia and the US, and Trump having a better policy.
[00:38:30.342 --> 00:38:32.003]  Why the hell would he launch a chemical attack?
[00:38:32.023 --> 00:38:32.543]  Well, here's the thing.
[00:38:33.404 --> 00:38:37.906]  The globalists don't control the jihadis, they just fund them and protect a lot of them and let them in.
[00:38:38.967 --> 00:38:40.868]  Under the Democrats and McCain and Hillary and others.
[00:38:42.369 --> 00:38:54.296]  They all, all four chemical attacks, shot videos, we've already played all these, it's been in the news, of themselves screaming Allah Akbar and firing the chemical munitions via mortars.
[00:38:56.462 --> 00:38:57.542]  Because they're rock stars.
[00:38:57.562 --> 00:39:04.044]  When that's seen on the internet back home in Afghanistan or wherever, they get huge cash donations for their families.
[00:39:04.084 --> 00:39:05.844]  They're like Elvis Presley.
[00:39:06.725 --> 00:39:13.686]  When everybody sees that back home in Saudi Arabia or wherever they came from on their little Hajj of Jihad.
[00:39:15.807 --> 00:39:17.307]  In the happy hunting ground of Syria.
[00:39:18.587 --> 00:39:24.569]  And so we've seen this over and over again and I just don't want there to be a big fat juicy false flag
[00:39:26.625 --> 00:39:30.247]  And we're off to war with Iran because Iran is not Iraq.
[00:39:32.669 --> 00:39:33.710]  I'm not putting Arabs down.
[00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:35.191]  Arabs, I'm sure, are wonderful people.
[00:39:35.211 --> 00:39:38.293]  And they do have a warlike history to them.
[00:39:39.355 --> 00:39:48.578]  A slaving history and so much more, but the Iranians are Persians and they have a whole different history of military attacks and actions.
[00:39:48.878 --> 00:39:54.440]  And I can tell you the military I know, going back over 10 years, explained they already have nuclear weapons.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.180]  They got them from Pakistan.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.941]  They're getting delivery systems.
[00:39:58.361 --> 00:40:01.502]  And we do not want to go to war with Iran, but Saudi Arabia is going to push us into it.
[00:40:01.962 --> 00:40:05.323]  And that's basically what's happening here.
[00:40:05.463 --> 00:40:08.124]  And it's not a good situation.
[00:40:09.702 --> 00:40:15.603]  Most of your ISIS or Al-Qaeda types are double agents in Western intelligence and with Saudi Arabia.
[00:40:19.264 --> 00:40:23.065]  A lot of them are radicals, they believe what they're doing, but they're still under Western control to a certain extent.
[00:40:23.085 --> 00:40:25.986]  That's why you'll see them sent off to attack a country and brought back into the West.
[00:40:27.166 --> 00:40:29.647]  That's not the case with Iran, ladies and gentlemen, and Hezbollah.
[00:40:30.367 --> 00:40:34.448]  And they've got Iranian sleeper cells in every town and city.
[00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:42.212]  Who, if there is a major attack on Iran, are going to attack.
[00:40:43.732 --> 00:40:46.473]  And they're going to attack not soft targets.
[00:40:47.713 --> 00:40:50.274]  They're going to attack military bases and police stations.
[00:40:52.015 --> 00:40:52.995]  And here's a problem.
[00:40:53.135 --> 00:40:54.835]  I said they don't double agent a lot.
[00:40:54.975 --> 00:40:59.417]  Except with Obama, there was some double agenting and some deals.
[00:40:59.477 --> 00:41:05.059]  And we've caught Iranian groups before staging events and preparing events that are going to be blamed on right-wing groups.
[00:41:07.739 --> 00:41:09.640]  MS-13 is an auxiliary of the Democrats now.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.720]  I told you that three years ago.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.880]  Now it's admitted in mainstream news.
[00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:12.821]  FBI reports.
[00:41:13.961 --> 00:41:17.242]  Hezbollah does some cross-work with Democrats in some of the deep state.
[00:41:17.883 --> 00:41:23.365]  And so it can be used as cut-out proxies to basically set up other decoys.
[00:41:24.645 --> 00:41:35.829]  So again, this is a real politique briefing to the world, ladies and gentlemen, that the other big fourth pillar is we don't want a war with Iran.
[00:41:37.469 --> 00:41:42.251]  They're very close to toppling the mullahs through just cultural resistance.
[00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:46.653]  The people there don't want to be slaves, and I just think we need to stay out of it.
[00:41:47.713 --> 00:41:59.198]  I'm a little more inclined towards action in, in my view, you can call and disagree, I'll get the number out in a moment, in Venezuela, and I'm not calling for action, I'm saying it's in northern South America.
[00:42:00.228 --> 00:42:01.408]  Central America has collapsed.
[00:42:01.428 --> 00:42:02.309]  They've set up U.N.
[00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:05.069]  bases to move the migrant groups into the U.S.
[00:42:05.669 --> 00:42:12.231]  That's a real collapsed society bordering us with a dictator with people massively suffering.
[00:42:13.411 --> 00:42:17.513]  So I'd like to see Maduro go and have real elections and stabilize that oil-rich nation.
[00:42:18.813 --> 00:42:20.133]  I don't trust the neocons.
[00:42:20.633 --> 00:42:24.214]  They're like inbred mentally ill dogs or something, just like Democrats.
[00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:26.435]  They can't ever seem to do good.
[00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:37.845]  And so they would do either a Bay of Pigs on Trump and mess up his operation to get him, or they would put somebody in and it would just fall apart and then it's our whole new mess.
[00:42:37.966 --> 00:42:38.947]  And I just...
[00:42:39.815 --> 00:42:41.576]  It's just a disaster any way you slice it.
[00:42:42.177 --> 00:42:48.862]  So the answer is, cut off all the funding to Central and South American countries that don't work with us, put the military on the border, and secure that son of a bitch.
[00:42:49.422 --> 00:42:57.068]  And if Mexico continues to open up corridors into the U.S., well, then we have to invade Mexico 20, 30 miles in, create a security perimeter.
[00:42:57.248 --> 00:42:58.128]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[00:42:58.168 --> 00:43:01.491]  That's standard Pentagon doctrine to actually stop just this scenario.
[00:43:03.152 --> 00:43:07.055]  Ladies and gentlemen, this fight against the globalists has been like a 12-round
[00:43:08.874 --> 00:43:15.765]  Boxing match that's got more like a hundred rounds and I'd say we're in about the 85th round right now.
[00:43:16.843 --> 00:43:20.406]  Now, just today, I'm shooting this report on Friday afternoon.
[00:43:21.267 --> 00:43:30.555]  We've had really serious sabotage and attacks behind the scenes, and I've decided not to give the specifics of it for reasons that I can't disclose at this time.
[00:43:30.635 --> 00:43:39.463]  But the fact that President Trump's getting the country back, the fact that nationalists are getting elected all over the world, the fact that we're now aware of the threat of radical Islam,
[00:43:40.504 --> 00:43:48.467]  The fact that all of this is going on is really making the establishment very, very angry.
[00:43:49.168 --> 00:43:59.432]  It just came out today that Ilhan Omar, the authoritarian Somali that admits she hates America, called up and threatened Jack Dorsey and said, how dare you keep Trump on Twitter?
[00:43:59.832 --> 00:44:04.174]  He criticized me and showed my clips basically praising radical Islam.
[00:44:05.034 --> 00:44:07.275]  And Dorsey explained to her, well, we have free speech in this country.
[00:44:08.001 --> 00:44:21.451]  Well, the truth is, behind the scenes, if you're not President Trump, these types of phone calls and open calls for us to be censored in Congress have had the desired effect of them trying to curtail us and cut us down to nothing.
[00:44:21.811 --> 00:44:24.834]  They're even going after our basic operations center.
[00:44:26.015 --> 00:44:29.037]  They're going after our actual servers, our infrastructure.
[00:44:29.117 --> 00:44:30.898]  But we have redundancy built in.
[00:44:31.439 --> 00:44:36.743]  But that costs a lot of money to have people working overtime to keep our systems in place.
[00:44:37.563 --> 00:44:51.528]  So, in the final equation, if you want to see the globalists defeated, and if you want to see the deep state prosecuted that we're inches away from, if you want to see the tide totally turned, it takes money to prosecute an information war.
[00:44:51.868 --> 00:44:53.629]  We have truth, they have lies.
[00:44:54.229 --> 00:44:58.111]  The truth is more powerful than lies, but they have globalist dirty money.
[00:44:58.571 --> 00:44:59.871]  Fiat Federal Reserve money.
[00:45:00.532 --> 00:45:03.773]  So, I'm launching this weekend, for one week,
[00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:05.462]  New sales.
[00:45:05.522 --> 00:45:07.644]  We're having to end the t-shirt sale 50% off.
[00:45:08.164 --> 00:45:11.948]  We're having to end the sale on a free bottle of Knockout with Brain Force Plus.
[00:45:11.968 --> 00:45:13.009]  That ends in just a couple days.
[00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.613]  But we're launching two new super specials right now.
[00:45:17.854 --> 00:45:18.955]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:45:19.881 --> 00:45:36.772]  Which is the ultimate bone broth, strongest bone broth formula with chaga mushroom, with concentrated turmeric, with all sorts of other key ingredients known to fight inflammation, known to be antioxidants, known to be good for your joints, your bones, your eyes, everything.
[00:45:37.052 --> 00:45:39.894]  And then organic, concentrated chicken broth.
[00:45:39.934 --> 00:45:44.717]  Everybody knows that, you know, when you got the flu or whatever, that chicken broth, for whatever reason, has that essence that's good.
[00:45:45.017 --> 00:45:45.358]  This is
[00:45:46.138 --> 00:45:51.162]  Like dozens and dozens of bowls of chicken broth, each serving without all the calories.
[00:45:51.802 --> 00:45:53.183]  Bone broth is amazing.
[00:45:53.423 --> 00:45:55.585]  Everybody knows its attributes for thousands of years.
[00:45:55.925 --> 00:45:56.986]  It's the hottest item out there.
[00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:05.475]  We went out a few years ago and looked at all the top-selling, best-rated brands and said, let's make it even stronger and even better for a low price.
[00:46:05.495 --> 00:46:08.778]  Because most places mark them up five, six, seven times.
[00:46:09.198 --> 00:46:09.799]  We mark it up 150%.
[00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:13.741]  When we have a discount, we only mark it up 100%.
[00:46:14.502 --> 00:46:18.945]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is only marked up about 65% right now.
[00:46:19.506 --> 00:46:23.729]  You can get ultimate bone broth formula, which is low in stock.
[00:46:24.389 --> 00:46:28.413]  For only $19.95 at Infowarstore.com.
[00:46:28.934 --> 00:46:30.255]  Experience it for yourself.
[00:46:30.355 --> 00:46:31.096]  It tastes okay.
[00:46:31.416 --> 00:46:36.761]  But if you mix it in with whey, if you mix it in with some fruit, if you mix it in with some milk and things, it tastes great.
[00:46:37.262 --> 00:46:37.923]  Drink it down.
[00:46:38.163 --> 00:46:40.125]  Great post-workout.
[00:46:40.765 --> 00:46:41.907]  Great meal replacement.
[00:46:42.267 --> 00:46:43.088]  This is really it.
[00:46:43.488 --> 00:46:45.010]  Ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:50.092]  50% off the already discounted price at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:50.312 --> 00:47:00.157]  We've got another special there as well that I don't have time to tell you about, but while you're on the site, look for the Buy Survival Shield X2 and get X3 absolutely free.
[00:47:00.437 --> 00:47:01.418]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:09.642]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:32.942 --> 00:47:41.648]  Gavin McInnes, one of the most censored people in the world, is going to be joining us in the third hour.
[00:47:41.668 --> 00:47:43.789]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:46.211]  Tom Pappard's going to pop in for a segment.
[00:47:46.251 --> 00:47:49.813]  He's a syndicated radio host and manages one of our fine TV affiliates.
[00:47:51.014 --> 00:47:54.376]  He got suspended from Facebook for doing the OK sign.
[00:47:55.882 --> 00:47:56.402]  That's right.
[00:47:56.563 --> 00:48:02.167]  The left finds new symbols every day to ban and persecute people as the Thought Police.
[00:48:02.907 --> 00:48:09.732]  But I want to open the phones up specifically on the four pillars I laid out of defending free speech for election integrity.
[00:48:10.813 --> 00:48:11.554]  That's number one.
[00:48:12.294 --> 00:48:13.315]  Stopping election fraud.
[00:48:13.355 --> 00:48:15.777]  That all goes in one area of First Amendment.
[00:48:16.757 --> 00:48:19.600]  And then, of course, defend the economy for the private Federal Reserve.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:20.941]  It's already been trying to spike it.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:27.485]  And then, of course, defend the borders, but don't let the neocons and the leftists get us into big, giant wars.
[00:48:27.505 --> 00:48:29.867]  Because it's the left today that wants all these wars.
[00:48:31.168 --> 00:48:36.953]  They say Trump's this big warmonger, but he's been trying to get us out of Afghanistan, has gotten us out of Syria, and so much more.
[00:48:36.973 --> 00:48:38.735]  I'm not just mindlessly defending Trump here.
[00:48:39.884 --> 00:48:41.684]  I'm simply defending reality and the facts.
[00:48:41.704 --> 00:48:45.085]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:47.086]  Toll-free number to join us.
[00:48:47.106 --> 00:48:50.126]  We're going to do first-time callers in this first round.
[00:48:50.146 --> 00:48:50.186]  877-789-2539.
[00:48:50.206 --> 00:48:51.407]  877-789-ALEX on this Thursday Global Broadcast.
[00:48:51.427 --> 00:48:52.787]  We'll take your calls.
[00:49:02.469 --> 00:49:09.659]  Coming up in the next hour, into the third hour and fourth hour as well, with Matt Bracken.
[00:49:09.759 --> 00:49:10.640]  Oh, he's a perfect guest.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:18.250]  Former Navy SEAL, best-selling author, counterterrorism specialist, to get into Iran, Venezuela, and so much more.
[00:49:19.426 --> 00:49:24.449]  Okay, obviously I've got like 50 clips that we'll never get to them all, but we're loaded for bear as always.
[00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:33.935]  We've got all the big abortion laws changing towards a pro-life stance and what the left's insane, frenzied response to that is going to be.
[00:49:34.575 --> 00:49:39.498]  We've got massive Islamic takeover news and censorship against those that even criticize it in any way.
[00:49:39.958 --> 00:49:43.601]  But I'm asking first-time callers, what do you think of those four pillars?
[00:49:44.531 --> 00:49:48.934]  What do you think of my statement that if Trump doesn't take dramatic action on those, he will lose in 2020?
[00:49:49.134 --> 00:49:55.659]  I mean, the big one is not letting us have free speech over modern telecommunications and calling it private company.
[00:49:56.079 --> 00:49:57.180]  Well, AT&T's private.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.162]  They gonna break in on your phone calls, you say the wrong thing and not let you talk?
[00:50:00.862 --> 00:50:02.023]  They're actually talking about that now.
[00:50:02.063 --> 00:50:03.784]  That's how high-tech computers are.
[00:50:04.105 --> 00:50:05.826]  That's how they can surveil and record everything.
[00:50:07.227 --> 00:50:10.089]  Just 20 years ago, I'd say they can surveil and record everything in lifetime.
[00:50:10.909 --> 00:50:12.971]  And in the future, they'll stop what you can type in lifetime.
[00:50:13.891 --> 00:50:20.194]  Now Microsoft announced their new Microsoft Word, won't let you type certain words, and is surveilling you in live time.
[00:50:20.994 --> 00:50:22.575]  It's all happening.
[00:50:22.955 --> 00:50:24.376]  It's all here.
[00:50:24.836 --> 00:50:25.417]  We're in 2019.
[00:50:25.677 --> 00:50:29.499]  We are in the future.
[00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:31.960]  The future is now.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:37.923]  The tyrants are trying to steal control of the future.
[00:50:39.423 --> 00:50:40.444]  What are we going to do?
[00:50:41.741 --> 00:50:45.226]  Alright, your calls are coming up right when we start the next hour.
[00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:47.288]  Now let me hit this.
[00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.055]  The good news is Trump is saying I don't want to have a military strike on Iran.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:57.663]  But they better stop harassing our ships and boats and provocations, which they have been involved.
[00:50:57.763 --> 00:51:01.886]  And now Trump has made the Federal Reserve, Private Federal Reserve, back off on raising interest rates.
[00:51:02.106 --> 00:51:03.727]  He's trying to secure the border, at least some.
[00:51:04.267 --> 00:51:09.010]  But he needs to declare a proper national emergency, put the regular military on there, ignore the courts.
[00:51:09.030 --> 00:51:10.351]  It's a constitutional crisis.
[00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:11.111]  We're in a crisis.
[00:51:11.472 --> 00:51:12.913]  The President has control of the border.
[00:51:13.786 --> 00:51:16.568]  That's the executive's purview.
[00:51:16.688 --> 00:51:25.372]  It's the President's jurisdiction, first and foremost, is defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, securing the borders.
[00:51:27.353 --> 00:51:28.614]  That's what the executive does.
[00:51:29.935 --> 00:51:32.836]  The Congress allots money, controls the purse.
[00:51:33.656 --> 00:51:35.998]  They've given that to the private Federal Reserve.
[00:51:36.918 --> 00:51:38.279]  So it's unprecedented what's happening.
[00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:45.853]  And he's trying to, obviously, stand up to censorship.
[00:51:45.893 --> 00:51:48.935]  Trump urges big tech censorship victims to share their stories.
[00:51:49.436 --> 00:51:51.477]  Adam Salazar wrote about this last night.
[00:51:52.117 --> 00:51:56.380]  It rolled off the front page of NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:51:56.941 --> 00:52:06.427]  But I'm going to ask the crew to repost it to the top of NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com and everybody tweet the NewsWars version.
[00:52:07.108 --> 00:52:09.970]  They try to block you on Twitter and everywhere else if you tweet InfoWars.
[00:52:11.189 --> 00:52:14.951]  But the leftist tards are so stupid that they still haven't figured out news wars.
[00:52:15.351 --> 00:52:16.411]  That's a great way to get that out.
[00:52:16.752 --> 00:52:20.073]  Trump urges big tech censorship victims to share stories.
[00:52:20.833 --> 00:52:27.376]  Trump administration builds dossier of social media bias ahead of 2020 elections.
[00:52:27.436 --> 00:52:29.477]  And believe me, he's got his people on it.
[00:52:29.817 --> 00:52:39.642]  I know actually a fella who is involved, I wouldn't say quarterbacking it, but like a running back.
[00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:41.430]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:56.131]  And don't so much get the calls from Trump anymore, which is fine.
[00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:56.791]  It's novel.
[00:52:56.931 --> 00:52:57.471]  I don't even care.
[00:52:57.832 --> 00:53:00.233]  I've told Trump, hey, you don't need to call and pat me on the head.
[00:53:00.253 --> 00:53:01.654]  I just want you to take action.
[00:53:01.674 --> 00:53:08.497]  But then I just get calls from folks in the administration or in U.S.
[00:53:08.537 --> 00:53:09.037]  intelligence.
[00:53:09.418 --> 00:53:10.338]  And none of this is a secret.
[00:53:10.358 --> 00:53:11.339]  All my phones are listened to.
[00:53:11.619 --> 00:53:13.720]  So the establishment knows this is what pisses them off so bad.
[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:17.042]  And then I get asked, or Rob Dewey gets asked, you know, we just get calls.
[00:53:18.162 --> 00:53:20.544]  Well, what do you think the best thing is for the President to do on this?
[00:53:20.564 --> 00:53:22.085]  Well, send us a report on that.
[00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:23.405]  Send us a bunch of articles.
[00:53:24.166 --> 00:53:29.129]  And then we send it, and then it goes into a file, and then there's reports, and we're just gathering intelligence on the globalists.
[00:53:29.709 --> 00:53:43.237]  And then now the President's just reaching out to you, the same way, and saying, you're human intelligence, on the ground, you know what happened to you, you have the screenshot they sent you, you have how they banned you on Twitter or Facebook, you have what they banned, send it all to us!
[00:53:44.704 --> 00:53:50.706]  Just like Mark Dice got banned on Facebook for a Scooby-Doo meme.
[00:53:50.726 --> 00:53:52.386]  Type in Mark Dice's Scooby-Doo meme, please.
[00:53:53.246 --> 00:53:54.667]  So Jesse Smollett's Scooby-Doo meme.
[00:53:54.687 --> 00:53:56.487]  You can click, images is everywhere.
[00:53:56.507 --> 00:53:57.708]  And, you know, the old Scooby-Doo.
[00:53:57.908 --> 00:54:09.131]  Every episode of Scooby-Doo, you grew up learning there isn't really a monster, there isn't really a gorgon, a zombie, a vampire, a werewolf, a chupacabra, a Bigfoot.
[00:54:09.711 --> 00:54:10.451]  There's somebody.
[00:54:14.423 --> 00:54:21.907]  Who wants to run everybody out of the town so they get the ski resort to have a mine or whatever?
[00:54:22.487 --> 00:54:23.888]  Everybody knows about false flags.
[00:54:24.688 --> 00:54:25.969]  And they said that was hateful.
[00:54:26.989 --> 00:54:30.931]  And so, Instagram blocked it, which is Facebook, and then he got suspended for a few weeks.
[00:54:31.492 --> 00:54:32.372]  That'll teach you!
[00:54:32.392 --> 00:54:39.756]  Because, you know, at the end of each episode, they pull the mask off the monster, and oh, it's really... Oh, it's really...
[00:54:40.936 --> 00:54:43.118]  Now let's see who's really behind the protest.
[00:54:43.559 --> 00:54:43.999]  Gasp!
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:45.501]  Old Man Soros!
[00:54:46.622 --> 00:54:47.583]  Let's see if you try to do that.
[00:54:47.643 --> 00:54:49.124]  Oh, Jussie Smollett staged it.
[00:54:50.165 --> 00:54:52.608]  Well, well, well, well, well.
[00:54:53.489 --> 00:54:54.229]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:56.592]  And so that's just been delivered to the President.
[00:54:57.534 --> 00:54:58.814]  It's all being delivered.
[00:54:59.414 --> 00:55:02.955]  And then you're going to see TV ads and radio ads and press conferences about it.
[00:55:02.995 --> 00:55:11.517]  And then you're going to see moving against the Democrats and big tech admittedly trying to steal 2020 and lying to Congress about it.
[00:55:11.557 --> 00:55:15.378]  So good job, President Trump.
[00:55:16.178 --> 00:55:21.899]  And good job audience who are activists, men and women in the arena for taking action.
[00:55:22.019 --> 00:55:22.759]  I salute you.
[00:55:23.779 --> 00:55:24.540]  I commend you.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.700]  You're really doing it.
[00:55:28.055 --> 00:55:29.235]  Keep it up on the campaign trail.
[00:55:29.515 --> 00:55:30.356]  Keep it up on the streets.
[00:55:30.656 --> 00:55:31.716]  Keep it up on C-SPAN.
[00:55:31.916 --> 00:55:32.616]  And talk radio.
[00:55:32.816 --> 00:55:33.256]  And the internet.
[00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.337]  And don't stop.
[00:55:36.857 --> 00:55:41.338]  I got a bunch of examples of censorship we're going to get to, but again, Tom Papert's going to pop in bottom of the next hour.
[00:55:42.959 --> 00:55:43.659]  Radio host.
[00:55:43.759 --> 00:55:46.459]  Heads up one of the biggest Trump fan pages on Facebook.
[00:55:46.539 --> 00:55:47.960]  Millions of followers.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:52.541]  Tom Papert dared show the OK symbol.
[00:55:53.427 --> 00:56:00.634]  By the way, I've not been looking for the OK symbol, but I like Rodney Dangerfield and just old Jimmy Carson, Johnny Carson, all that stuff.
[00:56:01.615 --> 00:56:04.918]  So I, for fun, will actually punch up on the television old Johnny Carson.
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:14.447]  And without looking, man, it's like Johnny Carson doing the OK sign and it's Rodney Dangerfield doing the OK sign.
[00:56:14.507 --> 00:56:16.409]  It's just crazy.
[00:56:17.489 --> 00:56:23.295]  That they're attacking stuff in the international sign language symbol now of A-OK or it's great.
[00:56:24.857 --> 00:56:29.802]  It just makes my head spin at a certain point that we let these thought police do this and this is just crazy.
[00:56:31.544 --> 00:56:32.545]  Absolutely insane.
[00:56:32.565 --> 00:56:35.508]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:35.768 --> 00:56:36.589]  Please don't forget.
[00:56:37.674 --> 00:56:38.454]  We just flashed it.
[00:56:39.274 --> 00:56:42.656]  Please don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, we're not here if you don't support us.
[00:56:42.696 --> 00:56:44.196]  And I'm not bitching, I'm saying thank you.
[00:56:44.716 --> 00:56:46.277]  But you need Ultra 12.
[00:56:46.657 --> 00:56:51.378]  Double Strongman Secret 12, the best mythical bottlemen, vitamin B12 out there, the very same mythical bottlemen.
[00:56:51.678 --> 00:56:54.699]  I just reformulated it and signed a longer term deal, got a better deal.
[00:56:54.879 --> 00:56:57.520]  So I said, I'm gonna give you double the strength.
[00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:01.241]  The strongest out there that we know of in existence at 50% off out of the gates.
[00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:03.082]  But that special's gonna happen in a week or so.
[00:57:04.282 --> 00:57:10.689]  The big special we've been running for the last week and a half, two weeks, has got to end in the next few days because we're running out of Survival Shield Deep Earth Crystal X2.
[00:57:11.169 --> 00:57:12.090]  I thought it'd be our last run.
[00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:19.177]  We were able to get more, able to sign a longer contract, got a better deal, and now X3, the triiodine, which is amazing.
[00:57:19.617 --> 00:57:22.360]  Three types together with the Deep Earth Crystal.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:25.323]  That is free bottle of that with your bottle of X2.
[00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:28.069]  X2, 25% off.
[00:57:28.489 --> 00:57:30.010]  Free bottle of Survival Shield X3.
[00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:30.950]  Never had a deal that good.
[00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:34.891]  Find out why iodine's so amazing, but only the pure, good iodine.
[00:57:35.251 --> 00:57:39.473]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:39.513 --> 00:57:40.473]  Just peruse the site.
[00:57:40.833 --> 00:57:44.114]  Check out Infowarsstore.com and support the Second American Revolution.
[00:57:44.574 --> 00:57:46.975]  Whatever you do, spread the word about those local AM and FM stations.
[00:57:47.435 --> 00:57:49.116]  Only you can circumvent the censors.
[00:57:49.336 --> 00:57:50.356]  And by the way, you all.
[00:57:52.696 --> 00:57:53.937]  I want them shut down.
[00:57:53.977 --> 00:57:54.917]  I want them silenced.
[00:57:54.937 --> 00:57:55.737]  I want them muted.
[00:57:55.777 --> 00:57:57.618]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:57:57.998 --> 00:58:04.320]  They're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have.
[00:58:07.961 --> 00:58:12.122]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[00:58:15.143 --> 00:58:15.943]  Spreading articles.
[00:58:15.963 --> 00:58:16.763]  Spreading videos.
[00:58:16.803 --> 00:58:17.323]  Spreading links.
[00:58:17.343 --> 00:58:18.044]  You're gonna get demonized.
[00:58:18.064 --> 00:58:18.884]  You're gonna get attacked.
[00:58:22.355 --> 00:58:25.676]  That's going to do something terrible like help Trump get re-elected.
[00:58:25.696 --> 00:58:29.198]  That's really what all this is about.
[00:58:29.378 --> 00:58:34.760]  They say that they deem our content and our brand unsafe.
[00:58:37.081 --> 00:58:40.102]  Is the right to be, do, and say whatever you want.
[00:58:40.202 --> 00:58:41.603]  It's about freedom of expression.
[00:58:42.463 --> 00:58:44.804]  I'm a journalist.
[00:58:44.824 --> 00:58:48.886]  I'm a left not interested in telling the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype.
[00:58:51.218 --> 00:59:19.813]  They can say whatever they think, and I respect their constitutional right to do it, and I hope they respect my con- If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:59:26.258 --> 00:59:29.299]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.
[00:59:29.459 --> 00:59:32.500]  Now, we're bringing you an all-new version to help you reach your energy peak.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:39.982]  Ultra 12 from InfoWars Life takes advantage of the most effective and expensive form of B12 available, methylcobalamin, to provide you with twice the B12.
[00:59:40.162 --> 00:59:46.584]  Ultra 12 can help make DNA, support the body's energy production, and help produce healthy blood cells while assisting proper nervous system function.
[00:59:46.724 --> 00:59:50.425]  Take advantage of the superior form of B12 and head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:59:57.026 --> 01:00:00.688]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:15.127 --> 01:00:18.809]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:19.169 --> 01:00:21.069]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.290]  All right, we kick off the next segment.
[01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:28.092]  I'm going right to your phone calls on what does Trump need to do to secure victory in 2020?
[01:00:28.652 --> 01:00:33.374]  What do we need to do to really be there and give the support to make sure we restore the republic?
[01:00:33.914 --> 01:00:34.755]  Taking your phone calls.
[01:00:35.755 --> 01:00:41.817]  On those subjects, coming up in the next segment, here's part of Paul Joseph Watson's extremely informative report, a full report.
[01:00:42.377 --> 01:00:44.417]  Again, it's on newswars.com and infowars.com.
[01:00:44.857 --> 01:00:46.518]  So important you share this with everybody you know.
[01:00:46.538 --> 01:00:50.159]  A hysterical cult runs society.
[01:00:51.199 --> 01:00:52.780]  And again, it seems like they're idiots.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:53.200]  They're not.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:57.281]  They know if they can make you accept absurdity, you'll accept anything.
[01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:57.621]  Here it is.
[01:00:58.783 --> 01:01:01.065]  Guess who's a white supremacist now?
[01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.166]  Stephen Fry.
[01:01:02.246 --> 01:01:02.506]  Why?
[01:01:02.786 --> 01:01:04.607]  He did the OK hand sign.
[01:01:04.687 --> 01:01:10.932]  But Stephen Fry's a lifelong liberal, atheist, environmentalist, labour-supporting LGBT activist.
[01:01:11.052 --> 01:01:12.393]  Doesn't matter, he did this.
[01:01:12.573 --> 01:01:23.722]  But that whole thing was a contrivance of a bunch of nihilistic, autistic 4chan-spergloid trolls in a hysterical mainstream media that took them seriously by legitimising their autism in return for rage-bait revenue clicks.
[01:01:23.882 --> 01:01:25.023]  Doesn't matter, he did this.
[01:01:25.703 --> 01:01:27.864]  Guess who's the new face of the far right?
[01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.545]  This 14-year-old girl on YouTube says who?
[01:01:30.685 --> 01:01:31.366]  BuzzFeed!
[01:01:31.546 --> 01:01:32.506]  Must be true then.
[01:01:32.546 --> 01:01:42.771]  The writer of the hit piece on the 14-year-old girl, BuzzFeed's Joe Bernstein, says, There are many more people who simply want to preserve the ability to be bigoted on private platforms!
[01:01:42.851 --> 01:01:49.074]  But wait, isn't he the same guy who literally said, Kill a straight white man on your way to work tomorrow?
[01:01:49.495 --> 01:01:50.095]  Eh, doesn't matter.
[01:01:50.655 --> 01:01:52.536]  It's life when you work at BuzzFeed.
[01:01:52.616 --> 01:02:00.638]  According to BuzzFeed, this 14-year-old girl's edgy videos are among the most shocking things ever and represent a moral crisis.
[01:02:00.978 --> 01:02:06.759]  Celebrating an 11-year-old drag queen kid and encouraging people to stick dollar bills in his panties?
[01:02:06.899 --> 01:02:08.040]  That's wholesome.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.320]  There he is again.
[01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:20.422]  So a teenage girl is radicalizing young people and driving them towards political violence, while major left-wing newspapers openly incite political violence.
[01:02:20.642 --> 01:02:22.423]  It's okay when we do it.
[01:02:22.983 --> 01:02:24.703]  Oh, but it's just a milkshake.
[01:02:24.843 --> 01:02:31.465]  Yeah, if Owen Jones and Anna Soubry were getting doused with milkshakes, you'd all be wetting the bed like it was the return of the Third Reich.
[01:02:33.547 --> 01:02:35.852]  Never stop punching Nazis!
[01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.175]  Never stop lifting weights.
[01:02:37.356 --> 01:02:38.919]  Seems pretty low energy.
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.347]  Unlike Turbo Force, the ultimate energy boost without the comedown.
[01:02:44.926 --> 01:02:45.747]  Link in description.
[01:02:46.367 --> 01:02:53.473]  Microsoft is set to release a new version of Word that uses artificial intelligence to make your writing politically correct.
[01:02:53.653 --> 01:02:58.697]  You know how annoying it is when the iPhone corrects f***ing to docking every time you try and type it out?
[01:02:58.957 --> 01:03:01.239]  Imagine that for an entire essay.
[01:03:01.399 --> 01:03:07.304]  Rumour has it that every new purchase of Word will come with a voucher for a year's supply of Starbucks soy lattes.
[01:03:07.864 --> 01:03:10.966]  Still seems like a waste of money, unlike my Subscribestar.
[01:03:11.707 --> 01:03:12.208]  God, life is f***ed.
[01:03:30.097 --> 01:03:33.460]  ISIS extremists are using Instagram to promote jihad.
[01:03:33.641 --> 01:03:37.084]  Still, at least my dangerous selfies have been deleted forever.
[01:03:37.104 --> 01:03:38.325]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:03:38.786 --> 01:03:39.506]  Censorship.
[01:03:39.746 --> 01:03:44.371]  A weapon of tyrants used to oppress populations since the dawn of history.
[01:03:44.471 --> 01:03:47.774]  Widely recognized as inherently evil ever since.
[01:03:48.035 --> 01:03:54.040]  Until about 2018 when Western leftists in Silicon Valley started using it to their advantage.
[01:03:54.861 --> 01:03:56.602]  And it suddenly became virtuous.
[01:03:56.702 --> 01:03:57.803]  What a coincidence.
[01:03:58.063 --> 01:04:01.825]  Simply because they labelled everyone on the receiving end a Nazi.
[01:04:02.045 --> 01:04:08.569]  In 1943, the following directive was issued from party headquarters to all communists in the United States.
[01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:20.255]  It read, when certain obstructionists become too irritating, label them after suitable build-ups as fascist, or Nazi, or anti-Semitic.
[01:04:21.087 --> 01:04:25.570]  And use the prestige of anti-fascist and tolerance organisations to discredit them.
[01:04:26.371 --> 01:04:32.956]  In the public mind, constantly associate those who oppose us with those names which already have a bad smell.
[01:04:33.696 --> 01:04:37.279]  The association will, after enough repetition, become fact.
[01:04:37.359 --> 01:04:47.927]  We handed a hysterical cult that demands total obedience and punishes those who resist, with deplatforming, public shaming, violence and arrest, the power to run society.
[01:04:48.939 --> 01:04:49.359]  Whoops!
[01:04:49.899 --> 01:04:50.999]  It's been really shocking.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:59.481]  Imagine a cashless society where your grocery purchase gets declined because some pencil neck in Silicon Valley got offended by your tweets.
[01:04:59.621 --> 01:05:01.722]  You just imagined our collective future.
[01:05:01.762 --> 01:05:02.182]  We'll be back!
[01:05:06.543 --> 01:05:08.643]  Joey, we have something here for our special visitors.
[01:05:08.663 --> 01:05:09.603]  Would you like to have it?
[01:05:09.623 --> 01:05:10.824]  Thank you!
[01:05:10.844 --> 01:05:12.064]  Thanks a lot!
[01:05:12.584 --> 01:05:12.984]  Sure.
[01:05:13.004 --> 01:05:14.504]  You ever been in a cockpit before?
[01:05:14.524 --> 01:05:17.485]  No sir, I've never been up in a plane before.
[01:05:18.263 --> 01:05:20.164]  You ever seen a grown man naked?
[01:05:20.864 --> 01:05:22.124]  Paula, who said they like coke?
[01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:22.264]  Me!
[01:05:22.324 --> 01:05:23.645]  Alright, you tell me about that.
[01:05:23.665 --> 01:05:24.425]  I like Coca-Cola.
[01:05:24.845 --> 01:05:25.625]  Oh, Coca-Cola.
[01:05:25.705 --> 01:05:27.946]  Alright, but who knows about cocaine?
[01:05:28.086 --> 01:05:29.186]  Anyone ever seen cocaine?
[01:05:30.006 --> 01:05:32.307]  Yes!
[01:05:32.347 --> 01:05:33.287]  Hold it, one at a time.
[01:05:33.327 --> 01:05:34.047]  What about cocaine?
[01:05:34.188 --> 01:05:35.368]  Good thing, bad thing, what?
[01:05:35.508 --> 01:05:38.989]  Joey, you ever hang around the gymnasium?
[01:05:39.149 --> 01:05:39.909]  Who here smokes?
[01:05:41.430 --> 01:05:42.690]  Come here, come on, raise your hand.
[01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:45.452]  Well, other than your parents, who smokes?
[01:05:45.912 --> 01:05:45.972]  Me!
[01:05:45.992 --> 01:05:46.793]  You got your smoke ready?
[01:05:46.853 --> 01:05:48.835]  I've seen a lot of kids with 12 and 11 smoking.
[01:05:49.035 --> 01:05:49.815]  I don't smoke.
[01:05:50.096 --> 01:05:50.816]  Alright.
[01:05:51.117 --> 01:05:53.318]  I don't smoke because I'm a little kid.
[01:05:53.358 --> 01:05:55.000]  I'm only 5 years old.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.504]  Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?
[01:06:12.919 --> 01:06:18.824]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:18.844 --> 01:06:24.128]  It's a reliable source of information!
[01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:28.751]  50,000 unstoppable watts!
[01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:30.453]  Ha ha!
[01:06:30.713 --> 01:06:33.415]  And racks!
[01:06:33.435 --> 01:06:34.416]  And radio!
[01:06:35.997 --> 01:06:36.277]  And radio!
[01:06:36.317 --> 01:06:40.540]  And the car!
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.222]  Oh, they thought they'd shut us down a long time ago.
[01:06:43.456 --> 01:06:46.198]  They forgot about all those hundreds of radio stations, AM and FM.
[01:06:46.658 --> 01:06:49.140]  Some of them 50,000-watt AMs.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.544]  100,000-watt FMs.
[01:06:53.624 --> 01:06:56.186]  Or 100,000-watt shortwave.
[01:06:56.266 --> 01:07:01.570]  Former Voice of America transmitters blasting out.
[01:07:04.892 --> 01:07:06.613]  Oh, that's why we got our fingers in everything.
[01:07:07.574 --> 01:07:09.936]  We'll use smoke signals if we need to to reach people.
[01:07:14.207 --> 01:07:14.847]  It's your source.
[01:07:18.148 --> 01:07:14.847]  50,000.
[01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:22.429]  Unstoppable watch.
[01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.029]  Alright, let's stop there.
[01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:28.290]  By the way, Clutcher listeners, they've been on the show before.
[01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:31.371]  And then they got leftist attacks once Obama got in.
[01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:32.391]  We're a little bit ashamed of it.
[01:07:32.431 --> 01:07:35.111]  But I think I inspired that song too.
[01:07:35.171 --> 01:07:37.072]  A show I was doing about Fort Detrick.
[01:07:40.595 --> 01:07:43.256]  Bioweapons and other things, but it doesn't matter.
[01:07:43.276 --> 01:07:51.141]  Of course, Bellamy admits his big song really launched him was off this show, but then he got intimidated by all the threats too.
[01:07:51.161 --> 01:07:52.541]  But see, that doesn't matter.
[01:07:53.622 --> 01:07:55.563]  See, we don't follow the rock stars.
[01:07:55.683 --> 01:07:56.503]  They follow us.
[01:07:59.905 --> 01:08:06.049]  And then there's folks like the founder of Smashing Pumpkins, Billy Corgan, who's not a coward and who's proud.
[01:08:07.225 --> 01:08:11.249]  Of Infowars and others, inspiring his last five albums!
[01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:18.716]  You see, that's the real cultural power of Infowars and what we've done, and it's seen everywhere.
[01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:23.081]  Remember just two and a half years ago, it seems like a thousand years ago?
[01:08:25.923 --> 01:08:26.424]  Chris Carter.
[01:08:28.493 --> 01:08:35.378]  Relaunched X-Files, and he had an Alex Jones character, and he said, I think Alex Jones is good in the New York Times.
[01:08:35.418 --> 01:08:37.220]  He said, I don't think Alex Jones is a racist.
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.482]  I think Alex Jones wants to reboot America and is a good guy.
[01:08:41.763 --> 01:08:48.648]  And it was stuff like that made the establishment, when Trump won, go into a conniption fit.
[01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:53.932]  And they said, we're going to get this guy off the air, and we're going to shut him down.
[01:08:55.413 --> 01:08:57.455]  We're going to finance this Homeland character.
[01:08:58.763 --> 01:09:08.748]  For a hit show on cable that's Alex Jones, who we say is Alex Jones, who goes out and commits all these crimes and all this fake news and does all these bad things.
[01:09:12.069 --> 01:09:16.231]  And then that character, when he gets sued or the police come after him, he runs and hides in Homeland.
[01:09:16.812 --> 01:09:19.333]  Well, see, I'm not that character from Homeland.
[01:09:20.575 --> 01:09:21.596]  So we're not running and hiding.
[01:09:22.336 --> 01:09:37.188]  We're in the halls of Congress getting in Sundar Pichai, the head of Google's Face, and calling him a criminal liar, and saying he should be indicted for working with the Chai-coms in espionage, and now they're having closed-door intelligence hearings at the Senate discussing just that.
[01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:40.030]  Now, did I do that?
[01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:40.331]  No.
[01:09:42.032 --> 01:09:43.914]  I called the Emperor's new closeout.
[01:09:44.994 --> 01:09:45.675]  I said, no.
[01:09:45.695 --> 01:09:47.777]  2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:09:49.775 --> 01:10:01.265]  More importantly, our audience of hardcore, focused individuals that love freedom and understand how much trouble we're in, have spread the word and have not been intimidated.
[01:10:02.706 --> 01:10:04.707]  And that's really the amazing time we're living in right now.
[01:10:05.048 --> 01:10:14.956]  So, I want to go to your phone calls right now, throughout the balance of the transmission today, even when our guests are on, we'll be taking your calls.
[01:10:16.537 --> 01:10:17.258]  And I want to ask you,
[01:10:19.670 --> 01:10:20.893]  Where do you see the world right now?
[01:10:22.377 --> 01:10:23.900]  Are the globalists winning or are we losing?
[01:10:24.582 --> 01:10:26.186]  How could Trump lose in 2020?
[01:10:26.507 --> 01:10:28.331]  They're trying to say, oh, he's way ahead in the polls.
[01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:28.772]  Oh!
[01:10:29.568 --> 01:10:31.389]  You know, there's nobody really challenging him.
[01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.110]  Oh!
[01:10:32.890 --> 01:10:34.311]  They want us to feel complacent.
[01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:36.873]  They want us to feel like we've already won.
[01:10:37.773 --> 01:10:40.255]  When they're going to bring in massive censorship, it's already happening.
[01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:41.555]  Election fraud.
[01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:42.756]  They're trying to start wars.
[01:10:42.776 --> 01:10:44.037]  They're trying to kill the economy.
[01:10:44.197 --> 01:10:45.858]  They're trying to break our borders right now.
[01:10:45.938 --> 01:10:46.679]  We're in crisis.
[01:10:47.339 --> 01:10:50.681]  So don't think, because Trump's up there projecting confidence, that we're out of the woods.
[01:10:50.961 --> 01:10:51.622]  We're far from it.
[01:10:52.762 --> 01:10:58.426]  I want Trump to project confidence for the people, but to have the confidence to win the actual fight with the globalists.
[01:11:00.765 --> 01:11:02.566]  That's what this comes down to.
[01:11:04.207 --> 01:11:07.870]  Now, we're going to take your phone calls.
[01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:11.372]  Do you agree with me that he's got to do those four things or he's going to lose?
[01:11:12.053 --> 01:11:13.334]  The Democrats are in a fever.
[01:11:13.514 --> 01:11:14.775]  They're always trying to steal stuff.
[01:11:14.995 --> 01:11:15.975]  They got caught last time.
[01:11:16.216 --> 01:11:17.596]  Trump barely won because of the fraud.
[01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:19.118]  He had a tsunami landslide.
[01:11:20.779 --> 01:11:21.739]  What do we do to stop that?
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:23.901]  Seriously, what are you going to do?
[01:11:24.281 --> 01:11:25.422]  I mean, I'm asking, literally.
[01:11:26.122 --> 01:11:26.923]  I'm not condescending.
[01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:28.004]  I'm not saying you haven't done enough.
[01:11:28.064 --> 01:11:29.645]  I'm saying you're the core people.
[01:11:30.538 --> 01:11:33.719]  But the system hates that actually care that they know we're beating them.
[01:11:34.539 --> 01:11:35.300]  So I'm asking you.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.321]  Because every one of you is a general.
[01:11:38.861 --> 01:11:39.861]  Every one of you is a private.
[01:11:40.301 --> 01:11:42.402]  Every one of you is a mother and a father to this country.
[01:11:43.002 --> 01:11:44.083]  And it's son and it's daughter.
[01:11:44.583 --> 01:11:45.403]  It's all symbiotic.
[01:11:46.323 --> 01:11:50.765]  We're in this together, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:53.046 --> 01:11:53.966]  Is it just four pillars?
[01:11:54.906 --> 01:11:56.287]  Which one of the pillars is the most important?
[01:11:57.034 --> 01:11:59.657]  Which pillars is Trump doing a good job on and which pillars is he not?
[01:12:00.297 --> 01:12:01.038]  Are there other pillars?
[01:12:02.139 --> 01:12:03.800]  Are there sub-pillars to the pillars?
[01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:08.024]  Trump's gonna lose in 2020 unless he does those four things.
[01:12:09.986 --> 01:12:10.847]  I told you he was gonna win.
[01:12:12.449 --> 01:12:14.330]  If fraud could be overcome with a landslide.
[01:12:16.953 --> 01:12:18.674]  We were so dead on about the illegal spying.
[01:12:18.935 --> 01:12:20.076]  We were so dead on about everything.
[01:12:21.749 --> 01:12:31.314]  Because the funny thing happens, if you're immersed in research, if you're immersed in all the best guests, and immersed in all the calls, and this is all you do, you kind of start figuring out how stuff works.
[01:12:33.314 --> 01:12:34.075]  So I'll ask you again.
[01:12:35.155 --> 01:12:36.916]  Are we going to let them steal this election from us?
[01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:41.538]  Are we going to let them steal our victory to reboot the country back right at our moment of victory?
[01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:45.660]  Because I've got the DeVos, you know, the DeVos scum and the globalists.
[01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:48.642]  Truth is, I didn't predict any of this.
[01:12:49.742 --> 01:12:50.903]  They're so arrogant.
[01:12:51.724 --> 01:12:56.586]  They go on television in Europe and in the U.S.
[01:12:56.686 --> 01:12:59.587]  and say, we're not going to let populists have a voice.
[01:12:59.687 --> 01:13:00.908]  I'm very glad we're censoring.
[01:13:01.288 --> 01:13:02.068]  We're going to beat them.
[01:13:02.088 --> 01:13:03.509]  This is top globalist on U.S.
[01:13:03.529 --> 01:13:03.849]  TV.
[01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:11.792]  Debo Salita celebrates discussions being quickly erased from social networks.
[01:13:15.973 --> 01:13:19.214]  So, I ask you again, are we going to let them win?
[01:13:19.234 --> 01:13:20.335]  Are we going to put up with this crap?
[01:13:22.793 --> 01:13:24.694]  Let's talk to John in the great state of Texas.
[01:13:25.274 --> 01:13:26.435]  You're on the air, John, thanks for calling.
[01:13:27.535 --> 01:13:28.236]  Hi, Alex.
[01:13:29.016 --> 01:13:29.296]  Welcome.
[01:13:29.336 --> 01:13:36.540]  You know, the first thing, the first sign that Donald Trump needs to quit doing is quit giving him the Clint Smith's Communist Salute.
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.641]  I've seen him do it numerous times.
[01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:45.324]  There was another website, I had a picture of him standing next to the dictator of China giving the Clint Smith's Communist Salute.
[01:13:46.185 --> 01:13:49.086]  And I don't know if he's an outright communist or not, but
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:52.763]  People should, somebody should tell them to quit doing it, because it hurts me.
[01:13:54.385 --> 01:13:58.769]  Well, you know, I know folks get really upset about signals and symbols, but a symbol can mean anything.
[01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:00.271]  You ever heard of trolling?
[01:14:00.972 --> 01:14:02.373]  Because the U.S.
[01:14:02.433 --> 01:14:05.977]  is breaking China's legs right now, devastating their operations.
[01:14:06.057 --> 01:14:11.202]  Huge announcements were made today against their 5G system, and as you can understand,
[01:14:12.123 --> 01:14:16.387]  In China, that's not so much the symbol of revolutionary communism, but it is in the West.
[01:14:16.447 --> 01:14:20.410]  So Trump there with the communists doing that is, oh, I love your leader.
[01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:21.431]  Oh, I'm your friend.
[01:14:21.811 --> 01:14:25.754]  He takes that energy away that they would have saying he's an enemy.
[01:14:26.395 --> 01:14:29.257]  So in my view, I think Trump is trolling them.
[01:14:29.277 --> 01:14:29.697]  What do you think?
[01:14:31.179 --> 01:14:32.300]  Well, I don't think he's a communist.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:34.862]  I don't think he can make a bad choice doing that.
[01:14:35.362 --> 01:14:36.423]  No, listen, I hear you.
[01:14:36.443 --> 01:14:37.123]  But I mean, people.
[01:14:39.165 --> 01:14:40.947]  I'm not saying you're wrong that I think it's bad.
[01:14:42.091 --> 01:14:44.453]  visual etiquette to be doing the fist.
[01:14:44.473 --> 01:14:46.755]  You know, the fist just meant resistance before the communists took it.
[01:14:47.075 --> 01:14:48.696]  Why do we let the left take every symbol?
[01:14:48.996 --> 01:14:54.120]  Rainbows, fist, rising suns, uh, you know, everything's supposedly occultic.
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:59.844]  And I'm not saying you're wrong that the, but I mean, you know, he, he wears an American flag at, at Davos.
[01:14:59.864 --> 01:15:03.467]  He wears an American flag at EU meetings when everybody else is wearing global government pins.
[01:15:03.527 --> 01:15:04.768]  I mean, he does a lot of good stuff.
[01:15:04.788 --> 01:15:05.829]  It's not about defending Trump.
[01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:07.790]  You called in about the four pillars though.
[01:15:07.810 --> 01:15:09.652]  Did you want to comment on what Trump needs to do to win?
[01:15:11.487 --> 01:15:13.748]  He's got to do away with his censorship.
[01:15:13.768 --> 01:15:15.248]  This is right out of the Soviet Union.
[01:15:15.688 --> 01:15:16.648]  That's the first threat.
[01:15:17.508 --> 01:15:19.909]  He needs to do away with these neocons.
[01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:22.169]  They're trying to start a war with Iran.
[01:15:22.549 --> 01:15:24.570]  A war with Iran is going to devastate this country.
[01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:27.450]  How many trillions of dollars in debt?
[01:15:27.570 --> 01:15:28.571]  How much is that going to cost?
[01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:30.851]  It's not to mention all the damage and stuff it'll do.
[01:15:33.832 --> 01:15:34.412]  I hear you, brother.
[01:15:34.472 --> 01:15:35.312]  I appreciate your call.
[01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:44.035]  I would take all that angry energy, and I'm not condescending here, I'm saying, call C-SPAN a few times a day during Washington Journal.
[01:15:44.536 --> 01:15:45.496]  Call on the talk radio.
[01:15:45.556 --> 01:15:47.417]  Go out with a bullhorn during a live event.
[01:15:47.457 --> 01:15:48.278]  Take over like we do.
[01:15:48.298 --> 01:15:49.999]  I mean, we're out there fighting.
[01:15:50.019 --> 01:15:51.399]  We're the men in the arena, and you are too.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.541]  And I encourage you to call this show.
[01:15:53.581 --> 01:15:56.022]  I would just call shows outside of the choir.
[01:15:56.462 --> 01:15:57.903]  Or call straight ahead on the side of this break.
[01:15:58.403 --> 01:15:59.304]  InfoWars.com.
[01:15:59.724 --> 01:16:00.504]  Don't visit that site.
[01:16:00.745 --> 01:16:01.065]  It's evil.
[01:16:12.421 --> 01:16:16.662]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:16:16.782 --> 01:16:17.563]  They are technocrats.
[01:16:17.843 --> 01:16:19.943]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:16:20.544 --> 01:16:27.426]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:16:28.326 --> 01:16:29.807]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:32.329]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:16:32.850 --> 01:16:39.075]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:16:39.255 --> 01:16:40.015]  And I'm not perfect.
[01:16:40.476 --> 01:16:41.396]  I work a lot of hours.
[01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:46.961]  And if I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:16:47.601 --> 01:16:56.608]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:16:57.589 --> 01:17:03.252]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter you're going to find anywhere.
[01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:07.014]  That's what we set out with top developers in the United States to do.
[01:17:07.294 --> 01:17:10.836]  It took us years to up the quality of being able to concentrate it like this.
[01:17:11.476 --> 01:17:12.697]  Secret 12 is still amazing.
[01:17:13.377 --> 01:17:15.718]  This is the next level.
[01:17:15.758 --> 01:17:16.518]  This is Ultra 12.
[01:17:17.298 --> 01:17:23.119]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:17:23.179 --> 01:17:26.240]  You take it under your tongue for maximum absorption.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.200]  It tastes great.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.881]  There's no sweeteners, no additives.
[01:17:29.201 --> 01:17:29.901]  It is amazing.
[01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:37.803]  Experience pure Methocobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants and their attack on our free speech.
[01:17:38.263 --> 01:17:43.909]  At InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[01:17:44.089 --> 01:17:53.039]  Again, Ultra 12, the best vitamin B12, the highest quality you're going to find anywhere, and it funds the Info War, and really pisses the globalist control freaks off.
[01:17:53.279 --> 01:17:56.683]  So again, thank you for your support, and thank you for taking care of your own body.
[01:18:04.272 --> 01:18:08.713]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:18:08.953 --> 01:18:13.634]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have making it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:18:14.254 --> 01:18:20.095]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs 50 cents or so, or less.
[01:18:20.515 --> 01:18:33.097]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[01:18:33.857 --> 01:18:42.544]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:18:42.564 --> 01:18:44.466]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:18:44.806 --> 01:18:45.907]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:18:45.947 --> 01:18:47.208]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:18:47.408 --> 01:18:48.589]  He doesn't drink anything.
[01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:50.289]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:52.390]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:54.191]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:18:54.551 --> 01:18:57.152]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:18:57.192 --> 01:18:58.052]  This is insane.
[01:18:58.472 --> 01:19:00.093]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:19:00.333 --> 01:19:02.893]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:19:03.334 --> 01:19:04.874]  He says, this is totally free.
[01:19:04.894 --> 01:19:06.735]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:19:06.755 --> 01:19:08.615]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:19:09.456 --> 01:19:15.397]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:19:15.637 --> 01:19:16.978]  All just moderate dose.
[01:19:18.510 --> 01:19:26.502]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:19:26.542 --> 01:19:28.925]  So, that's available at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:28.965 --> 01:19:30.107]  But thank you for committing.
[01:19:34.165 --> 01:19:36.987]  They get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:19:37.367 --> 01:19:39.969]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:19:39.989 --> 01:19:44.753]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:19:45.233 --> 01:19:47.595]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films.
[01:19:48.235 --> 01:19:51.357]  And, you know, it's just hustling to be able to get high quality products out.
[01:19:51.377 --> 01:19:54.500]  So you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:56.141]  It's called reap what you sow.
[01:20:06.423 --> 01:20:09.145]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.291 --> 01:20:24.555]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:27.957 --> 01:20:43.465]  The Christchurch call was not only something extremely moving but also extremely effective because the key players in the social network had decided to support
[01:20:45.207 --> 01:21:01.888]  It's something which has been discussed amongst the head of states, the Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was there and has been making a very moving speech regarding how the hatred and
[01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:25.796]  Speech of hate are contaminating the social network and I believe that this is a landmark in how people will now operate and how some discussion will be quickly erased from the social network.
[01:21:25.936 --> 01:21:33.584]  There is still some criticism that potentially the changes don't go far enough because it still puts the onus on the social media companies to do more.
[01:21:33.925 --> 01:21:41.072]  And one of the issues seem to be the ability of these technology companies to remove negative content very quickly, almost immediately.
[01:21:41.533 --> 01:21:47.179]  Do you think we're going to see that change of behavior from technology companies that you have worked with a lot as an advertiser?
[01:21:47.919 --> 01:21:55.063]  I think that it's not only a question of technology, it's also a question of willingness.
[01:21:55.864 --> 01:22:12.373]  And there was a big debate regarding freedom of speech, and can they remove things because of the freedom of speech, or should they have a kind of censorship?
[01:22:12.933 --> 01:22:20.175]  And at the end of the day, there is a balance which has been made, and I think that where we are today is a good step.
[01:22:20.375 --> 01:22:29.678]  I wouldn't say that it's the ultimate solution, and this is the best thing that we can do, but I think it's a step in the right direction.
[01:22:31.618 --> 01:22:36.742]  Facebook has been extremely strong on their willingness to help.
[01:22:37.062 --> 01:22:41.084]  It's the same with Jack Dorsey, who was there personally.
[01:22:41.104 --> 01:22:55.633]  And we feel that there is a consciousness of the leaders of the social network that this can harm and this can be a terrible thing for society.
[01:22:56.234 --> 01:22:59.696]  So they are conscious of the need and they have taken steps.
[01:23:00.879 --> 01:23:02.659]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.521]  Davos elitists celebrate discussions being quickly erased from social networks, close quote.
[01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:14.402]  Anything disagreeing with world government, sexualizing your children, not letting radical Islam in.
[01:23:15.263 --> 01:23:18.023]  They're now saying if you criticize Islam in any way, you're just banned everywhere.
[01:23:18.363 --> 01:23:19.624]  They're arresting people in Europe.
[01:23:20.464 --> 01:23:23.465]  All they let the Islamists run around burning and killing and stealing and raping.
[01:23:24.285 --> 01:23:25.145]  Absolutely criminal.
[01:23:25.405 --> 01:23:27.746]  And then they go before Congress and say, we're not censoring anybody.
[01:23:28.476 --> 01:23:33.398]  Meanwhile, they've got this guy on CNBC throwing it in your face.
[01:23:34.099 --> 01:23:35.279]  What does Trump need to do?
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:36.980]  Well, antitrust.
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:40.102]  Go after them for their criminal selling of data.
[01:23:40.842 --> 01:23:41.823]  They're lying to Congress.
[01:23:43.623 --> 01:23:45.924]  This argument that, oh, they're a private company, you can't do anything.
[01:23:46.525 --> 01:23:50.587]  The EU, the CHICOMs, are already creating regulations.
[01:23:51.792 --> 01:23:54.153]  That then override our laws of free speech.
[01:23:54.213 --> 01:23:55.133]  We have to say no.
[01:23:55.613 --> 01:23:56.373]  Just like Huawei.
[01:23:57.053 --> 01:24:00.394]  Openly caught spying all over the world whenever they put 5G in.
[01:24:00.494 --> 01:24:01.034]  Backdoors.
[01:24:01.315 --> 01:24:02.555]  Chinese government run.
[01:24:05.636 --> 01:24:08.316]  And Trump says, no, now you can't even sell your equipment in the U.S.
[01:24:08.776 --> 01:24:10.557]  He signed that order last night.
[01:24:12.197 --> 01:24:17.959]  You can do the same damn thing to Facebook and Twitter and Google and all these arrogant people.
[01:24:20.114 --> 01:24:21.275]  They're not so arrogant now, though.
[01:24:21.295 --> 01:24:22.216]  They figure out what's happening.
[01:24:23.436 --> 01:24:25.118]  Let's go to Mike in Illinois.
[01:24:25.158 --> 01:24:34.204]  Mike, I call the four pillars of what Trump must do to not have the election stolen and our nationalist movement, our populist movement, killed in 2020.
[01:24:34.264 --> 01:24:36.806]  That's only a year out now from the heart of the race.
[01:24:37.266 --> 01:24:37.947]  I've listed those.
[01:24:37.967 --> 01:24:38.908]  For new listeners, I'll do it again.
[01:24:40.029 --> 01:24:41.549]  Mr. Jones, it's an honor to talk to you.
[01:24:41.589 --> 01:24:41.989]  Welcome.
[01:24:42.029 --> 01:24:44.170]  I think you're right on with the four pillars.
[01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:46.410]  I saw something very interesting the other day.
[01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:49.391]  I don't know if people realize how controlled this man is.
[01:25:10.586 --> 01:25:16.367]  It was a YouTube video of an interview between Chris Plant and President Trump.
[01:25:17.668 --> 01:25:22.749]  And if you look in the background, the whole interview were people waving him off, trying to stop the interview.
[01:25:22.769 --> 01:25:31.071]  I'm not omnipresent, so I don't know about Trump was being interviewed by somebody and people are waving him off.
[01:25:31.091 --> 01:25:31.591]  What does that mean?
[01:25:32.111 --> 01:25:32.991]  By Chris Plant.
[01:25:33.931 --> 01:25:36.552]  And, you know, he's another radio personality.
[01:25:38.110 --> 01:25:43.313]  And everybody in the background kept waving him off because they were talking like you and I are talking right now.
[01:25:44.813 --> 01:25:49.876]  So I really think he's very isolated and doesn't know a lot that's going on.
[01:25:50.876 --> 01:25:59.760]  Sure, you're saying, I don't know what you're saying, you're saying the president goes over to talk to some radio host and there's all these people, all these handlers trying to keep him from talking to him.
[01:26:00.541 --> 01:26:03.082]  Absolutely, and Chris Plans is very conservative.
[01:26:03.832 --> 01:26:05.574]  So I'm sure they didn't disappoint.
[01:26:22.662 --> 01:26:23.302]  Information.
[01:26:23.983 --> 01:26:31.067]  So that's what John Kelly said his main mission was, to keep Trump from being able to surf the internet or make phone calls.
[01:26:31.648 --> 01:26:32.488]  And so you're absolutely right.
[01:26:32.548 --> 01:26:36.090]  In fact, can we fade up the Facebook audio and video for TV viewers?
[01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:44.816]  Because we found what you're talking about, where the president sees somebody, comes over and talks to him, and then the establishment doesn't like it, and so they're trying to wave him off.
[01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:47.920]  I appreciate it very much.
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.103]  And I know that you're talking about taxes today.
[01:26:51.143 --> 01:26:55.828]  I've just been speaking to some of your staff, some of your people about all of that.
[01:26:55.868 --> 01:27:01.814]  Now, what's the one thing, the key thing that the American people and your voters need to know about tax reform?
[01:27:01.874 --> 01:27:05.417]  Well, we're the highest taxed nation in the world.
[01:27:06.558 --> 01:27:10.521]  A lot of this is the president's busy, he's got to go places, people are going to wave him off and wave him over.
[01:27:10.561 --> 01:27:15.585]  But, you know, regardless, people always look for something like a video they see for the proof of what's happening.
[01:27:16.166 --> 01:27:19.188]  But you can have like total admissions and just no one even cares.
[01:27:20.288 --> 01:27:21.990]  It's like all over the news they try to handle him.
[01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:24.153]  All over the news they try to control what info he gets.
[01:27:24.533 --> 01:27:25.794]  He'll try to sign executive orders.
[01:27:25.814 --> 01:27:28.277]  They'll slip them under things to make sure they don't go out.
[01:27:28.698 --> 01:27:31.120]  There's total rebellion in the government against Trump.
[01:27:31.481 --> 01:27:33.183]  There's massive mutiny going on.
[01:27:33.403 --> 01:27:37.047]  There's whole agencies not doing what the president says when it's legal and lawful.
[01:27:37.387 --> 01:27:39.009]  You've got judicial tyranny.
[01:27:39.770 --> 01:27:41.430]  Yeah, I have one more topic to touch with you.
[01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:42.151]  It's a Ted Nugent story.
[01:27:42.171 --> 01:27:42.951]  I live in McHenry County.
[01:27:43.271 --> 01:27:44.991]  We're 35 miles west of Thunderdome, which I call Chicago.
[01:28:06.207 --> 01:28:10.649]  And it was announced a few months ago that Ted Nugent will be playing at our county fair this summer.
[01:28:12.109 --> 01:28:14.891]  And of course, all the usual suspects were outraged.
[01:28:15.051 --> 01:28:18.452]  They want to have, uh, they want to cancel him.
[01:28:19.272 --> 01:28:20.673]  They want to have demonstrations.
[01:28:20.973 --> 01:28:21.934]  And guess what happened?
[01:28:23.014 --> 01:28:25.175]  All time record presale of tickets.
[01:28:26.624 --> 01:28:29.806]  Well, I think you hit the key here, and I keep meaning to say this every hour, I should say it.
[01:28:30.507 --> 01:28:32.989]  When you don't give in to censors and double down, they fail.
[01:28:33.089 --> 01:28:33.689]  They're bullies.
[01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:36.311]  The left has no viewers, no listeners, no one likes them.
[01:28:36.732 --> 01:28:41.776]  Except for mentally ill, you know, folks that have five college degrees and huge debt and can't get a job, as you know.
[01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:47.380]  So they want a communist overthrow because they've got a degree in communist management of American slaves.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:48.281]  Seriously.
[01:28:48.841 --> 01:28:49.822]  So yes, absolutely.
[01:28:49.942 --> 01:28:50.562]  Double down.
[01:28:51.023 --> 01:28:52.244]  Don't give in to the intimidation.
[01:28:52.444 --> 01:28:53.484]  Override their censorship.
[01:28:53.765 --> 01:28:54.685]  Say no, no, no.
[01:28:55.726 --> 01:28:56.206]  Stay with us.
[01:28:56.246 --> 01:28:59.227]  Tom Pappard got banned off Facebook for doing this.
[01:28:59.507 --> 01:29:00.347]  The OK sign.
[01:29:00.548 --> 01:29:01.088]  He joins us.
[01:29:01.108 --> 01:29:01.988]  Stay with us.
[01:29:03.248 --> 01:29:11.031]  I scream and it's like Google goes, I'm wearing a pink and a green sock and I got a little beard and I talk like this.
[01:29:11.071 --> 01:29:12.631]  You know what those guys do when they get on jets?
[01:29:12.851 --> 01:29:17.673]  They go, bring me 15 hookers now and get the drugs ready and take me to the private island.
[01:29:19.333 --> 01:29:20.614]  Get the satanic rituals ready.
[01:29:23.194 --> 01:29:25.215]  You don't just think the enemy has sleeper cells, do you?
[01:29:31.328 --> 01:29:36.712]  They've told me directly, if I don't want to be sued, if I don't want to be attacked, if I don't want to be, you name it, stop reporting on this.
[01:29:37.012 --> 01:29:39.875]  And guess what I'm going to say to the big bank, the Newark Federal Reserve, everybody else.
[01:29:39.895 --> 01:29:41.096]  Here's what I have to say to them.
[01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:41.916]  Hey, you ready?
[01:29:41.936 --> 01:29:43.658]  This is what I'm saying to you right now.
[01:29:44.238 --> 01:29:45.039]  You got that message?
[01:29:45.739 --> 01:29:46.420]  Never going to stop.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:47.320]  Never going to stop.
[01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:48.141]  Going to beat you too.
[01:29:50.403 --> 01:29:51.203]  We're in a fight here.
[01:29:51.223 --> 01:29:53.705]  I got like two battle axes fighting them.
[01:29:53.745 --> 01:29:54.706]  They're hacking at me.
[01:29:54.746 --> 01:29:55.587]  We're like, ah!
[01:29:57.508 --> 01:29:59.450]  But you don't want to come out of mommy's basement.
[01:30:00.945 --> 01:30:06.768]  You want to sit there and suck on your own little wee-wee and play video games and pretend like you're this big, you know, badass person.
[01:30:06.948 --> 01:30:08.929]  You're a soldier on the internet battling everybody.
[01:30:08.949 --> 01:30:12.891]  A lot of liberals have broken their conditioning because of it.
[01:30:12.911 --> 01:30:13.991]  Just keep making fun of me!
[01:30:14.171 --> 01:30:14.832]  Keep attacking!
[01:30:14.892 --> 01:30:15.492]  I love it!
[01:30:15.512 --> 01:30:16.713]  I'm totally destroying you!
[01:30:23.356 --> 01:30:24.096]  So under U.S.
[01:30:24.136 --> 01:30:27.278]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B... Is that true?
[01:30:27.318 --> 01:30:29.379]  You nailed that right there?
[01:30:29.399 --> 01:30:29.959]  Yes, yes.
[01:30:34.435 --> 01:30:36.578]  Oh man, you want to fight, you're going to get one.
[01:30:37.079 --> 01:30:40.864]  I don't want to lose my voice, but I just want you to know.
[01:30:46.869 --> 01:30:51.893]  The majority of the frogs, uh, in most areas in the United States are now gay.
[01:30:54.835 --> 01:30:56.177]  But it's like a rape fight.
[01:30:56.717 --> 01:30:59.259]  You know, it looks all nice and candy, puppy.
[01:30:59.599 --> 01:31:00.760]  That's how they act all liberal.
[01:31:01.081 --> 01:31:02.882]  Oh my gosh, communism's really good.
[01:31:03.122 --> 01:31:03.803]  You're gonna like it.
[01:31:03.823 --> 01:31:04.663]  Get in the car.
[01:31:06.125 --> 01:31:07.826]  Oh, you like that?
[01:31:07.886 --> 01:31:08.406]  Wonder Man.
[01:31:09.627 --> 01:31:10.528]  Oh yeah, you like that?
[01:31:10.548 --> 01:31:11.009]  We'll see it again?
[01:31:11.349 --> 01:31:11.589]  Oh yeah?
[01:31:12.089 --> 01:31:14.451]  Woo!
[01:31:14.792 --> 01:31:16.273]  Yeah, that's goblin power.
[01:31:18.908 --> 01:31:20.269]  This broadcast is in four days.
[01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.470]  Four days.
[01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:25.513]  I'm Alex Jones and I do the show here weekdays 11 a.m.
[01:31:25.553 --> 01:31:25.893]  to 3 p.m.
[01:31:25.953 --> 01:31:27.915]  and then we have Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:31:28.055 --> 01:31:32.198]  You're on the air.
[01:31:32.238 --> 01:31:35.080]  Hey Alex and all the Info Wars, can you hear me?
[01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:36.221]  Yes sir, I can!
[01:31:40.136 --> 01:31:41.237]  Thank God!
[01:31:41.437 --> 01:31:52.851]  Literally, I have waited and I've been, I'm a very patient man and I'm a man of God and I'm a man of Christ and I believe that we can look
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:06.243]  Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home.
[01:32:06.404 --> 01:32:08.706]  But sometimes supplements don't work fast enough.
[01:32:08.886 --> 01:32:12.049]  That's why we created a powerful addition to the Super Blue line.
[01:32:12.289 --> 01:32:14.190]  Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[01:32:14.411 --> 01:32:17.774]  Available in 1 oz., 3.5 oz., and 16 oz.

[01:33:06.363 --> 01:33:08.986]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.348 --> 01:33:16.049]  Big Brother.
[01:33:16.489 --> 01:33:17.711]  Mainstream media.
[01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.393]  Government cover-ups.
[01:33:20.194 --> 01:33:21.616]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:33:21.877 --> 01:33:23.038]  Well, so does he.
[01:33:23.519 --> 01:33:28.205]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:47.857 --> 01:33:50.958]  Alright, we're going to continue with your phone calls throughout this hour and the next.
[01:33:50.978 --> 01:33:53.779]  Gavin McInnes is going to join us as well.
[01:33:53.979 --> 01:33:56.500]  In fact, I forgot this, guys, before I forget for next hour.
[01:33:57.641 --> 01:34:15.548]  There's an actual email that we got from a national newspaper of what Facebook actually sent out to the press when we were banned two weeks ago, now today, that actually says because we had Gavin McInnes, a major hate leader on, that was another reason we were being permanently banned.
[01:34:16.766 --> 01:34:18.967]  Now remember, Obama hangs out with Louis Farrakhan.
[01:34:19.767 --> 01:34:21.408]  So does Stevie Wonder and everybody else.
[01:34:21.428 --> 01:34:22.449]  And I say, that's their free speech?
[01:34:22.489 --> 01:34:22.789]  Fine.
[01:34:26.130 --> 01:34:28.251]  But Farrakhan's banned as well.
[01:34:29.011 --> 01:34:30.852]  So imagine these degrees of separation.
[01:34:30.872 --> 01:34:31.953]  So we have that email.
[01:34:32.553 --> 01:34:34.574]  I had the crew do an article on it last week.
[01:34:35.074 --> 01:34:38.296]  Or somebody can get in the email and get me that letter again.
[01:34:38.356 --> 01:34:43.058]  We have about 40 minutes till I get him on, but I'll need that by then.
[01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:44.378]  Thank you.
[01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:45.439]  Now, continuing here.
[01:34:46.991 --> 01:34:52.613]  Tom Pappert is a talk show host in his own right, and he manages a great TV station.
[01:34:52.653 --> 01:34:55.274]  We're on KCTU there in Wichita, Kansas.
[01:34:56.055 --> 01:35:02.137]  Facebook slaps Trump supporter with 30-day ban for doing OK hand sign.
[01:35:03.058 --> 01:35:06.479]  Now again, they're saying they're not censoring anybody who's conservative.
[01:35:07.860 --> 01:35:13.602]  No, just if you do an OK sign that everyone on earth, from Rodney Dangerfield to
[01:35:16.269 --> 01:35:17.410]  Eddie Murphy has done.
[01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:21.472]  It's in the International Hand Sign Symbol, meaning OK.
[01:35:22.012 --> 01:35:26.235]  If you're diving, and they ask you if you have enough air, everything's OK.
[01:35:27.075 --> 01:35:29.137]  As you kind of go along the bottom, they say, are you OK?
[01:35:30.117 --> 01:35:32.899]  Now, we all know that the system knows it's not racist.
[01:35:33.419 --> 01:35:36.581]  They just want to be able to take anything and say, you can't say mother and father.
[01:35:36.641 --> 01:35:37.161]  That's hateful.
[01:35:37.922 --> 01:35:39.102]  Or, well, you misgendered me.
[01:35:39.142 --> 01:35:40.023]  I'm really two genders.
[01:35:40.043 --> 01:35:40.863]  You never know.
[01:35:40.903 --> 01:35:49.128]  It's all about, it's impossible for you to serve me and taking the mental illness of the universities and expanding it out across the world.
[01:35:50.509 --> 01:35:51.730]  But Tom has been suspended.
[01:35:53.041 --> 01:35:55.182]  As an evil thought criminal, Paul Joseph Watson wrote about it.
[01:35:55.202 --> 01:35:56.963]  He also writes for BigLeaguePolitics.com.
[01:35:57.003 --> 01:35:57.383]  Tom does.
[01:35:57.883 --> 01:36:02.606]  Facebook slaps Trump supporter with 30-day ban for doing OK hand sign.
[01:36:03.166 --> 01:36:06.748]  And of course the providence of this was 4chan loves to troll Hillary.
[01:36:08.068 --> 01:36:11.510]  So three years ago, right before the campaign ended, she lost.
[01:36:11.530 --> 01:36:16.472]  She said that this frog they like, this is a white supremacist leader.
[01:36:16.572 --> 01:36:18.153]  She made it the white supremacist leader.
[01:36:21.225 --> 01:36:22.746]  And then 4chan said, yes.
[01:36:22.866 --> 01:36:29.169]  And when Trump does this, the OK sign, which he does all the time for 40 years, saying, hey, everything's great.
[01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.749]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:36:29.829 --> 01:36:30.749]  Oh, you'll love our golf course.
[01:36:30.789 --> 01:36:31.349]  It's really good.
[01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:33.891]  Like a chef says, oh, you're going to love the food.
[01:36:35.271 --> 01:36:35.811]  They bought it.
[01:36:36.472 --> 01:36:40.053]  And so now you've got Cubs fans doing it, which means support of Trump.
[01:36:40.213 --> 01:36:41.134]  Well, that's blurred out.
[01:36:41.274 --> 01:36:41.994]  Lifetime bans.
[01:36:42.674 --> 01:36:44.215]  This is a contrived hysteria.
[01:36:44.295 --> 01:36:46.776]  And it's incredibly
[01:36:48.254 --> 01:36:51.056]  Dangerous that it's gotten to this point.
[01:36:52.177 --> 01:36:53.658]  But again, these people mean business.
[01:36:53.698 --> 01:36:58.161]  Tom, I wonder if you'll get banned from banking.
[01:36:58.281 --> 01:37:00.122]  I mean, they're already saying ban all is from banking.
[01:37:00.162 --> 01:37:02.664]  I mean, maybe you'll be banned from any sporting event next.
[01:37:02.744 --> 01:37:05.406]  I mean, you made a hand signal.
[01:37:05.426 --> 01:37:06.307]  You're in a lot of trouble, Tom.
[01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:09.262]  I know, I guess I'm a Nazi.
[01:37:09.382 --> 01:37:13.165]  I had no power in this decision, but Facebook decided that I'm a Nazi.
[01:37:13.185 --> 01:37:14.425]  And it's actually funny, Alex.
[01:37:14.465 --> 01:37:16.227]  You know, you talk about the baseball stadium.
[01:37:16.647 --> 01:37:26.793]  That picture, it was a screenshot from a show I did last week, making fun of the absurdity of getting banned from Wrigley Fields for doing the OK symbol.
[01:37:26.833 --> 01:37:30.595]  And so I'm saying that if you do an OK symbol, I guess you're an evil, angry man.
[01:37:31.616 --> 01:37:34.518]  And I make the funny face, and somebody took a screenshot of it.
[01:37:34.838 --> 01:37:40.141]  And they sent it to me and they added the literal Nazi because of course I'm a Nazi because I do this now.
[01:37:40.641 --> 01:37:42.002]  And so it was just a joke.
[01:37:42.302 --> 01:37:46.544]  An absurd, over-the-top joke and Facebook took it seriously.
[01:37:46.884 --> 01:37:48.825]  And you're right, it is this type of hysteria.
[01:37:48.885 --> 01:37:51.626]  This type of, oh we finally got him, we got him for something.
[01:37:51.666 --> 01:37:52.507]  He's a bad man.
[01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:55.388]  You know, it really does make you wonder what's next.
[01:37:55.408 --> 01:38:00.031]  And we've already had conservatives banned from banking, and we've had conservatives banned from payment processors.
[01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:01.632]  I know you're no stranger to this.
[01:38:01.672 --> 01:38:05.074]  You've had probably a dozen payment processors block you.
[01:38:05.454 --> 01:38:09.996]  But you know, Alex, I don't see you doing this very often, so I guess maybe it's unwarranted.
[01:38:10.036 --> 01:38:11.657]  Maybe you're not a bad guy after all.
[01:38:11.697 --> 01:38:12.858]  Maybe frogman good.
[01:38:16.308 --> 01:38:18.569]  I mean, you heard my breakdown of this, of why they're doing it.
[01:38:18.609 --> 01:38:25.513]  They're just appropriating every symbol, every system, saying it's evil, so that to communicate, you've got to go through these new high priests of communication.
[01:38:25.853 --> 01:38:27.574]  And that's what the EU and others even admit.
[01:38:27.634 --> 01:38:31.156]  They want prior restraint on memes, on all communications.
[01:38:31.196 --> 01:38:32.977]  This is incredibly cult-like.
[01:38:34.784 --> 01:38:35.364]  It really is.
[01:38:35.545 --> 01:38:36.805]  And that's really what they want to do.
[01:38:36.845 --> 01:38:38.887]  They want to control how we talk to each other.
[01:38:38.947 --> 01:38:41.628]  How we think in our day-to-day life.
[01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:43.430]  The words that go into our brain.
[01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:46.251]  I will hear people say a word that is banned on Facebook.
[01:38:46.291 --> 01:38:47.632]  And it's not a terrible word.
[01:38:47.692 --> 01:38:48.853]  It's not a terrible slur.
[01:38:49.213 --> 01:38:50.674]  It could be like the T word.
[01:38:50.814 --> 01:38:52.275]  And I don't mean transmission.
[01:38:52.595 --> 01:38:53.356]  Something close though.
[01:38:54.179 --> 01:38:59.401]  And I hear someone say that in my day-to-day and my heart skips a beat, like, oh my goodness, something bad's gonna happen.
[01:38:59.461 --> 01:39:03.142]  Like, I expect Facebook's thugs to come out of the woodwork to haul this guy away.
[01:39:03.162 --> 01:39:03.602]  Let's be clear.
[01:39:03.702 --> 01:39:06.343]  The, the, the, the Trannies call themselves Trannies.
[01:39:06.363 --> 01:39:06.523]  Right.
[01:39:07.243 --> 01:39:09.924]  So, so, then if you say that, though, you're bad.
[01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:10.724]  It's all selective.
[01:39:10.744 --> 01:39:11.884]  It's, it's a new royalty.
[01:39:12.164 --> 01:39:13.084]  It's a total tyranny.
[01:39:13.104 --> 01:39:14.905]  And it's just absolutely out of control.
[01:39:16.135 --> 01:39:38.774]  Absolutely, this type of language policing, and if they can get us to go along with their rules, you know, I did a whole show last night, I was on, somebody else came over to my studio so I could use their Facebook account, because I follow all the rules, and so I did a show last night and I said, you know, you're not going to stop me, you're not going to stop me for making jokes, I'm not going to comply with your insane globalist thought policing, because that's how they win.
[01:39:38.974 --> 01:39:43.658]  If they can make you say that Big Brother is good, that's how they win, that's how they finally won in 1984.
[01:39:44.759 --> 01:39:47.001]  Winston submitted after torture.
[01:39:47.421 --> 01:39:53.205]  No, I'm not going to submit, and that's what I think is so powerful about broadcasts like this one, that you will not submit.
[01:39:53.245 --> 01:40:02.192]  You would rather be banned into oblivion, go down the memory hole, then play along with their little rules and stop saying the T-word, tranny.
[01:40:02.692 --> 01:40:07.376]  And notice, Tom, they're always adding new words and new things we can't use.
[01:40:07.776 --> 01:40:08.596]  There's never enough.
[01:40:08.637 --> 01:40:09.537]  That's the whole point of this.
[01:40:09.917 --> 01:40:11.519]  Once you surrender to thought police,
[01:40:12.099 --> 01:40:14.940]  The sky's the limit, and they admit they're doing this.
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:22.843]  What do you make of the President coming out and saying and setting up a site at the White House where you can report all the censorship you're going through?
[01:40:22.863 --> 01:40:26.704]  I think that's a big step in the right direction, but the election is barreling towards us.
[01:40:27.204 --> 01:40:29.085]  I think he needs to take serious action now.
[01:40:30.302 --> 01:40:31.483]  Well, I agree with you completely.
[01:40:31.523 --> 01:40:33.885]  I think that this is a good, important step.
[01:40:33.945 --> 01:40:36.007]  I hope that the president will take it seriously.
[01:40:36.047 --> 01:40:38.249]  I hope that the administration will take it seriously.
[01:40:38.329 --> 01:40:39.950]  But just look at how many people are gone.
[01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:47.356]  How many people who were out there in the trenches circumventing the mainstream media's narrative back in 2016 that are already gone.
[01:40:47.417 --> 01:40:51.220]  You, Gavin McInnes, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Laura Loomer.
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:54.543]  The names just stretch as far as you can see.
[01:40:55.323 --> 01:40:58.245]  And so these are the president's top supporters being taken down.
[01:40:58.305 --> 01:40:59.566]  So I hope that he will do something.
[01:40:59.586 --> 01:41:02.728]  I hope he's not going to wait and examine and monitor.
[01:41:02.808 --> 01:41:09.473]  I appreciate that he is posting about this and that he is actively making it a part of his campaign speeches when he goes out to do his rallies.
[01:41:09.893 --> 01:41:11.354]  But we need some real action.
[01:41:11.454 --> 01:41:21.080]  Because at this point, the big tech companies, they think that the Trump administration, I just guessed this, I have no insider knowledge, but they seem to think that the Trump administration is weak and they're ineffectual.
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:22.301]  Let's expand on that.
[01:41:22.341 --> 01:41:24.723]  David from the big neocon at Atlantic Monthly.
[01:41:25.303 --> 01:41:29.269]  He said two weeks ago, don't worry, President Trump's weak.
[01:41:29.329 --> 01:41:30.390]  He's not going to take action.
[01:41:30.711 --> 01:41:31.532]  He's all talk.
[01:41:31.672 --> 01:41:32.373]  Shut him down.
[01:41:33.174 --> 01:41:37.000]  Now he changed the headline later because people were like, well, that might actually get him to take action.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:38.822]  But this is just insane.
[01:41:39.042 --> 01:41:40.404]  You can't say Alex Jones.
[01:41:40.905 --> 01:41:43.246]  You can't say Infowars unless it's in a negative light.
[01:41:43.526 --> 01:41:45.027]  You can't show an OK sign.
[01:41:45.507 --> 01:41:52.931]  What a bunch of sick freaks on the left saying we're white supremacists, applying it to that, and then stealing our free speech via that.
[01:41:52.971 --> 01:41:54.312]  That is so sick.
[01:41:54.692 --> 01:41:59.655]  While the left runs around foaming at the mouth, calling for everybody else to be censored.
[01:42:01.069 --> 01:42:03.130]  Calling for censorship and calling for violence.
[01:42:03.210 --> 01:42:08.634]  I can't tell you how many death threats I get in the Facebook page inbox or on my own personal profile.
[01:42:08.934 --> 01:42:10.055]  But that's totally fine.
[01:42:10.115 --> 01:42:15.999]  I can't tell you how many groups there are where people are calling for actual violence against Trump supporters.
[01:42:16.159 --> 01:42:17.880]  Actual discrimination against Trump supporters.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:21.602]  But all of that gets ignored because they're in the right and we're in the wrong.
[01:42:21.662 --> 01:42:22.523]  We are the enemy.
[01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:23.203]  We are the other.
[01:42:23.343 --> 01:42:24.024]  That's right.
[01:42:24.044 --> 01:42:25.445]  They're the wholly anointed.
[01:42:26.025 --> 01:42:27.286]  They're the establishment.
[01:42:27.326 --> 01:42:28.506]  They get to play God.
[01:42:28.866 --> 01:42:31.087]  And you look at the useful idiots that have joined this system.
[01:42:31.107 --> 01:42:32.667]  They're so pathetic.
[01:42:32.988 --> 01:42:35.488]  Because the algorithms, the AI is already replacing them.
[01:42:35.989 --> 01:42:42.271]  All the leftist publications from BuzzFeed to Salon are going bankrupt, closing their doors, because their job is done.
[01:42:42.291 --> 01:42:48.473]  They don't even get, the left doesn't get, nationalist patriots being around always would have given them a job.
[01:42:49.093 --> 01:42:51.674]  They don't get, like, removing everybody, now you're obsolete.
[01:42:52.194 --> 01:42:53.435]  But they don't care.
[01:42:54.318 --> 01:42:58.484]  They don't care because most of the leftist writers are mentally deficient.
[01:43:06.793 --> 01:43:10.715]  Stacey in the great state of Texas, in FEMA Region 6.
[01:43:11.155 --> 01:43:12.976]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:43:13.076 --> 01:43:13.776]  Good to talk to you.
[01:43:14.116 --> 01:43:18.278]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[01:43:18.498 --> 01:43:20.239]  I was turned on to the Ultimate Female Force.
[01:43:20.339 --> 01:43:24.740]  I looked at all the ingredients, and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[01:43:24.941 --> 01:43:26.841]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins.
[01:43:26.921 --> 01:43:31.263]  They don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural, so I appreciate that.
[01:43:31.343 --> 01:43:32.824]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:43:32.884 --> 01:43:33.344]  Tell us about it.
[01:43:33.424 --> 01:43:34.124]  Well, it's really great.
[01:43:34.145 --> 01:43:35.345]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:43:35.405 --> 01:43:35.846]  I take it.
[01:43:35.886 --> 01:43:36.506]  It tastes good.
[01:43:36.586 --> 01:43:38.267]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:43:38.347 --> 01:43:40.029]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:42.630]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day.
[01:43:42.670 --> 01:43:43.471]  So I really like it.
[01:43:43.491 --> 01:43:46.173]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:43:46.213 --> 01:43:47.754]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[01:43:47.874 --> 01:43:49.735]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:43:49.855 --> 01:43:50.336]  So, yeah.
[01:43:50.716 --> 01:43:52.577]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[01:43:53.037 --> 01:43:55.379]  These are amazing things in Ultimate Female Force.
[01:43:55.739 --> 01:43:56.640]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:58.521]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:44:06.011 --> 01:44:15.299]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[01:44:15.759 --> 01:44:26.749]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and wake-up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:44:27.469 --> 01:44:33.133]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee bean.
[01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:45.203]  Carefully harvested and free of toxic chemicals used in big agricultural productions, Patriot Blend coffees have a smooth, bold flavor with great depth to give you just what you need in the morning.
[01:44:45.443 --> 01:44:49.386]  You can even choose to start your morning healthier with the Immune Support Blend.

[01:44:55.871 --> 01:45:02.277]  Get a bag of Patriot Blunt coffee to support the show while enhancing your morning routine at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:03.018 --> 01:45:15.630]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:45:17.068 --> 01:45:23.493]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[01:45:23.514 --> 01:45:25.475]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[01:45:26.216 --> 01:45:30.800]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:36.545]  But then you add, not to the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there,
[01:45:37.265 --> 01:45:37.645]  Literally.
[01:45:38.386 --> 01:45:49.112]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the tumeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[01:45:49.932 --> 01:45:53.934]  Now, ultimate bone broth can be gulped down with water or milk or however you want to.
[01:45:54.235 --> 01:45:55.395]  The taste is okay.
[01:45:55.475 --> 01:45:58.877]  But when you mix it with whey or other things, some fruit, tastes great.
[01:45:59.417 --> 01:46:00.118]  What I like to do
[01:46:00.518 --> 01:46:03.180]  It's just put a scoop in, mix it with milk, bang it back.
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:09.544]  And whether it's for meal replacement, whether it's for post-workout, pre-workout, our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[01:46:10.204 --> 01:46:14.507]  It's 50% off right now at Infolwerestore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[01:46:14.887 --> 01:46:17.389]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[01:46:17.769 --> 01:46:23.933]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that has taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[01:46:24.654 --> 01:46:27.856]  Now, this is high quality and it's very thick, so doing it with a spoon takes a while.
[01:46:28.016 --> 01:46:29.197]  That's why I like to use a blender.
[01:46:35.643 --> 01:46:36.724]  Again, I love it with milk.
[01:46:37.724 --> 01:46:38.865]  Just bang this baby back.
[01:46:40.846 --> 01:46:46.090]  Mmm.
[01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:47.270]  Nothing like it for a meal replacement.
[01:46:47.290 --> 01:46:48.971]  It's way beyond any way you've ever had.
[01:46:48.991 --> 01:46:55.155]  Again, it's got the essence of the bones, the chaga mushroom, the turmeric, a bunch of other incredible stuff.
[01:46:55.636 --> 01:46:58.317]  This is what fuels patriots.
[01:46:58.337 --> 01:46:59.978]  This is what fuels people that really want to be healthy.
[01:46:59.998 --> 01:47:02.280]  It's ultimate bone broth at mfortworthslife.com.
[01:47:05.842 --> 01:47:08.484]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:37.443 --> 01:47:38.944]  Alright, I'm going to go back to your phone calls.
[01:47:39.004 --> 01:47:44.947]  Tom Pappert is about to go back to his great work at BigLeaguePolitics.com and managing that TV station he has.
[01:47:46.368 --> 01:48:00.616]  But, pulling back from this, you have the globalist overwhelming society, setting up an anti-human world government, flooding us with radical islamicists, sexualizing our children.
[01:48:02.847 --> 01:48:18.197]  And then you've got these attempts to have their cake and eat it too, and censor people, and celebrate censorship, and say they want to bankrupt people, and say they want to silence us, and just constant comments about go out and find a heterosexual and kill them, go out and find a white man and kill him.
[01:48:18.497 --> 01:48:25.381]  I mean, this is just the ethos of the vicious spew, and then if you do an okay sign, you're banned.
[01:48:26.101 --> 01:48:26.702]  It's just
[01:48:28.633 --> 01:48:30.413]  Shameful how criminal these people are.
[01:48:30.513 --> 01:48:31.634]  And they're not going to win.
[01:48:32.174 --> 01:48:36.975]  Because you can see the momentum building in Congress, building around the world to say no to this.
[01:48:37.835 --> 01:48:39.475]  And I don't think they're going to get away with it, Tom.
[01:48:39.535 --> 01:48:41.996]  I think that they've really pushed too far.
[01:48:42.436 --> 01:48:46.337]  But it's going to be a lot easier for society if we just crack down on these individuals.
[01:48:46.377 --> 01:48:52.418]  Because this whole right-wing, kind of fake libertarian cult, oh, they're private companies.
[01:48:52.538 --> 01:48:55.899]  Oh, okay, so AT&T can break in on my phone line and say what I can say?
[01:48:56.219 --> 01:48:56.839]  They can listen to me?
[01:48:58.029 --> 01:48:59.651]  Because they are listening, but they know it's illegal.
[01:48:59.671 --> 01:49:00.151]  They get in trouble.
[01:49:00.171 --> 01:49:01.232]  But Big Tech just does it.
[01:49:02.053 --> 01:49:03.074]  And it's the same thing.
[01:49:03.094 --> 01:49:04.236]  These people are a joke.
[01:49:04.556 --> 01:49:05.517]  They're out of control.
[01:49:06.058 --> 01:49:19.933]  And I think with what you see with Trump doing to the shycoms right now, what you see with Trump doing with these announcements to he is going to move forward against censorship, I just can't believe they don't get that after 40, 50 years of Big Tech having no oversight, it's coming.
[01:49:21.789 --> 01:49:28.471]  Well, and they have this fantasy, the big tech folks do, that if they can just make the regulations, then they'll be fine.
[01:49:28.511 --> 01:49:37.153]  And you see some of them are already saying, please regulate us, it'll be great, just regulate us and we'll tell you what regulations to put in place, which to me says they're scared.
[01:49:37.533 --> 01:49:46.755]  They realize that this is coming and they're hoping, praying, that they get some good regulation like the pharma people have, where it's going to cement their monopoly.
[01:49:47.855 --> 01:49:52.739]  I'm sure the GOP-E, the establishment, I'm sure they would love to give that to them because they benefit.
[01:49:52.779 --> 01:50:01.186]  You know, certain names that I won't denigrate anybody on your show, but certain very popular conservatives benefit from Big Tech because Big Tech knows that they're part of the Uniparty.
[01:50:01.206 --> 01:50:03.148]  They might as well have a D next to their name.
[01:50:03.428 --> 01:50:04.849]  They're just a token Republican.
[01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:07.670]  And the people that benefit see nothing wrong with any of this.
[01:50:07.710 --> 01:50:15.154]  They see it as removing the competition, getting rid of Alex Jones, getting rid of fun meme pages on the internet, getting rid of alternative and new media.
[01:50:15.514 --> 01:50:18.055]  They see it as a boon to their business model.
[01:50:18.135 --> 01:50:19.516]  They see it as a way to get more... You just said it.
[01:50:19.536 --> 01:50:21.897]  The Wall Street Journal, before I got banned last year, said...
[01:50:22.757 --> 01:50:25.758]  Once Jones is banned and no one stands up for him, we're going to ban everybody.
[01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:27.238]  The internet will be like Netflix.
[01:50:27.258 --> 01:50:30.079]  We're going to be incredibly popular and profitable.
[01:50:30.159 --> 01:50:32.980]  And that's what News Corps, as they were splitting up, was saying.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.020]  So exactly.
[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:39.381]  We've got the neocons, the bluebloods, wanting a monopoly of markets, saying, damn the First Amendment.
[01:50:39.681 --> 01:50:43.402]  Don't they get the left is going to slit their throats once they get control?
[01:50:43.662 --> 01:50:45.303]  I mean, they're crazy.
[01:50:45.423 --> 01:50:46.463]  The left is cancer.
[01:50:47.987 --> 01:50:48.488]  It really is.
[01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:50.069]  I think they think that they're part of it.
[01:50:50.369 --> 01:50:55.194]  You know, you've got these certain type of people where they just want to be a part of the game.
[01:50:55.494 --> 01:51:02.080]  They want to be a good little boy and get their pat on the head from the establishment, from the left, from the insane people.
[01:51:02.381 --> 01:51:03.622]  And they want to be part of the club.
[01:51:03.642 --> 01:51:05.644]  They want to be invited to the cocktail parties.
[01:51:05.684 --> 01:51:07.285]  They want to go to the donor meetings.
[01:51:07.706 --> 01:51:09.107]  And they think that they're just safe.
[01:51:09.287 --> 01:51:11.890]  And the fact is, once they can take all of us out,
[01:51:12.230 --> 01:51:19.195]  All of a sudden, the more moderate, so-called moderate voices, that are actually just establishment voices, they're going to be on the chopping block too.
[01:51:19.235 --> 01:51:28.242]  I mean, the way this ends, you're going to have Bernie Sanders' Democratic Party, and you're going to have Nancy Pelosi's Democratic Party, and nothing else out there.
[01:51:28.282 --> 01:51:32.065]  That will be all the realm of public discussion.
[01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:34.207]  Let's expand on that.
[01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:40.752]  Max Keiser was here about two and a half years ago after the election, and we went to dinner and hung out and all this, and he said,
[01:51:41.892 --> 01:51:45.694]  You can't tell this story on air, but I'm going to tell you the story.
[01:51:45.795 --> 01:51:46.735]  Then I saw him in D.C.
[01:51:46.755 --> 01:51:50.518]  three weeks ago at Trump Hotel, and he just started telling the story on camera.
[01:51:51.598 --> 01:51:54.700]  Because, you know, he's been really good friends with Alec Baldwin for 30 years.
[01:51:55.841 --> 01:51:57.542]  You know, he knows the Soros sons.
[01:51:57.562 --> 01:51:58.383]  He was a top broker.
[01:51:59.363 --> 01:52:03.706]  He was at a very famous folks house for a huge party.
[01:52:05.167 --> 01:52:07.328]  They had a big screen television that was a story tall.
[01:52:08.289 --> 01:52:10.631]  And there's all these top Democrats there, and Alec Baldwin's there.
[01:52:11.667 --> 01:52:15.228]  And when Trump won that night, Baldwin flipped out on him.
[01:52:15.268 --> 01:52:19.450]  They were all crying and said, I think you're a Russian agent.
[01:52:20.250 --> 01:52:26.552]  And actually called the FBI on his friend of 30 years that they've been on vacations together.
[01:52:26.952 --> 01:52:28.212]  You know, I mean, I mean, they're close.
[01:52:28.553 --> 01:52:29.313]  We're close friends.
[01:52:30.193 --> 01:52:34.334]  Alec Baldwin won't even talk to Max Keiser now, even though he's known him 30
[01:52:36.195 --> 01:52:43.360]  I mean, Max Keiser is in like 1988 videos on Nightline about the stock market, okay?
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:45.462]  I mean, he vacations with the Soroses.
[01:52:45.702 --> 01:52:46.422]  I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:52:47.083 --> 01:52:59.891]  And literally, Alec Baldwin, who's been in parties with Keiser 30-plus years ago and knows him and they vacation together, will not talk to him and actually believes he's a Russian agent.
[01:53:00.332 --> 01:53:01.833]  This is cuckoo land.
[01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:04.345]  Now he's the enemy.
[01:53:04.685 --> 01:53:05.667]  Now he's the other.
[01:53:05.727 --> 01:53:14.740]  You know, when I was at a left-wing college campus, they warned us against demonizing the other and making people who are just like you into the other.
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:18.867]  Now that is exactly what the left, what the social media tech people, what everybody on
[01:53:19.347 --> 01:53:22.048]  This massive globalist front is doing to us.
[01:53:22.368 --> 01:53:24.689]  They see Alex Jones and they say, you're not a person.
[01:53:24.949 --> 01:53:28.951]  They see some guy in his 20s doing the OK symbol and they say, you're not a person.
[01:53:29.211 --> 01:53:29.991]  We can ban you.
[01:53:30.031 --> 01:53:31.131]  We can take you out of the banks.
[01:53:31.172 --> 01:53:31.872]  We can attack you.
[01:53:31.912 --> 01:53:32.992]  We can call the police on you.
[01:53:33.192 --> 01:53:38.114]  We can turn on our friends of 30 years because suddenly you're not a human being anymore.
[01:53:38.254 --> 01:53:39.074]  You're the enemy.
[01:53:39.215 --> 01:53:41.055]  I mean, that's exactly what they're doing to us.
[01:53:41.175 --> 01:53:44.817]  And it's interesting that they think it's just censorship.
[01:53:44.837 --> 01:53:48.318]  Some of these controlled people, some of the blue bloods, as you say, because
[01:53:49.666 --> 01:53:51.368]  They're going to be turned on eventually.
[01:53:51.388 --> 01:53:52.649]  You know, we think they're wrong.
[01:53:52.689 --> 01:53:53.870]  They want us dead.
[01:53:54.251 --> 01:54:00.156]  Even the Blue Bloods, they've got their things where, well, I want a small government, and I want this, and I want that.
[01:54:00.376 --> 01:54:04.620]  Well, to them, you're saying that you want Hitler in office.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.083]  That's what the Democrats hear when you challenge their narrative nowadays.
[01:54:08.263 --> 01:54:11.526]  Exactly, because they've got two or three college degrees that are worthless.
[01:54:11.566 --> 01:54:12.066]  They're pissed.
[01:54:12.086 --> 01:54:13.227]  They're supposed to be the ruling class.
[01:54:14.301 --> 01:54:21.324]  This utopia that AOC and, you know, before her, Bernie Sanders, and of everything free, it's gonna get here.
[01:54:22.025 --> 01:54:26.567]  It's Donald Trump and Tom Papert and Max Keiser and Alex Jones and Gab McGinnis.
[01:54:26.587 --> 01:54:27.367]  They're the ones stopping it.
[01:54:27.847 --> 01:54:28.928]  Tom, you're awesome.
[01:54:28.988 --> 01:54:30.028]  We love your great work.
[01:54:30.448 --> 01:54:32.509]  All the great places people can follow you.
[01:54:32.890 --> 01:54:35.491]  You're blocked on Facebook now at God Emperor Trump Official.
[01:54:35.731 --> 01:54:38.772]  You're on Twitter for now at RealGETrump.
[01:54:38.832 --> 01:54:39.373]  God bless you.
[01:54:39.393 --> 01:54:40.053]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:54:41.104 --> 01:54:42.225]  Thank you for having me on, Alex.
[01:54:42.285 --> 01:54:43.065]  It's always a pleasure.
[01:54:43.306 --> 01:54:43.726]  Thank you.
[01:54:43.746 --> 01:54:49.830]  Now, I'm going to try to run through some calls here, and we'll take calls with Gavin McInnes, but I want to know specifically, what do you think Trump should do?
[01:54:49.850 --> 01:55:03.961]  Because the president is listening, and they're trying to codify a plan right now, and they've gotten down to the working groups that are developing the battle plans for what Trump's going to do, and the system is so pissed.
[01:55:04.641 --> 01:55:06.543]  There's no General Kelly in there as a filter.
[01:55:08.097 --> 01:55:14.643]  Trump's got lawyers, he's got antitrust people, he's got people he trusts from different U.S.
[01:55:14.703 --> 01:55:24.171]  intelligence agencies, who were supporters early on, and who he knows are good, and they're just reaching out and doing all the research, and now they want all the proof from everybody, and they're gonna take action!
[01:55:25.633 --> 01:55:31.838]  That's the really exciting announcement, it's up on InfoWars.com, Don Salazar's article, Trump urges big tech censors,
[01:55:35.527 --> 01:55:39.009]  Trump urges big tech censorship victims to share their stories.
[01:55:41.050 --> 01:55:42.210]  Again, very important story.
[01:55:42.250 --> 01:55:45.112]  Trump urges big tech censorship victims to share their stories.
[01:55:45.672 --> 01:55:47.233]  The links are at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:47.333 --> 01:55:48.033]  Follow the story.
[01:55:48.314 --> 01:55:48.974]  Follow the links.
[01:55:49.294 --> 01:55:49.854]  Do it now.
[01:55:50.014 --> 01:55:53.576]  Share the article from NewsWars.com on Twitter, on Facebook.
[01:55:53.756 --> 01:55:55.917]  And when they censor it, share that with the White House.
[01:55:56.238 --> 01:55:57.018]  See how they like it.
[01:55:57.878 --> 01:55:59.819]  They like to troll and complain and get us banned.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:02.461]  We're going to show how they're banning us and what they're doing.
[01:56:03.766 --> 01:56:04.587]  We're going to take action.
[01:56:04.627 --> 01:56:06.330]  Back in two minutes, we'll go right to your phone calls.
[01:56:06.370 --> 01:56:08.955]  I see some of the callers saying, is Alex going to sue back?
[01:56:10.137 --> 01:56:10.858]  I've sued PayPal.
[01:56:11.809 --> 01:56:12.549]  I've countersued.
[01:56:12.569 --> 01:56:13.669]  I'm fighting all these other suits.
[01:56:13.709 --> 01:56:14.510]  I've won most of them.
[01:56:14.730 --> 01:56:15.770]  You never see that in the news.
[01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:17.850]  I won two lawsuits last month.
[01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:20.051]  Yeah, we have the money.
[01:56:20.651 --> 01:56:21.691]  I've got to sue Facebook.
[01:56:21.711 --> 01:56:22.771]  They've listed me as a terrorist.
[01:56:23.091 --> 01:56:23.771]  They've defamed me.
[01:56:24.032 --> 01:56:25.052]  Trying to kill me, basically.
[01:56:25.732 --> 01:56:29.573]  I've got to sue this G2 group that's listed me as a terrorist in their filings.
[01:56:29.933 --> 01:56:30.693]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:56:30.713 --> 01:56:31.533]  I have no criminal record.
[01:56:31.573 --> 01:56:32.253]  I have great credit.
[01:56:32.273 --> 01:56:34.954]  You're just going to put me in a database as a criminal and ruin my life?
[01:56:35.574 --> 01:56:37.374]  There's no jury you're going to put up with your crap.
[01:56:38.394 --> 01:56:40.695]  But no one's been fighting back, so they think they're green-lit.
[01:56:41.860 --> 01:56:44.446]  I tell you, the White House is looking at G2, all of it.
[01:56:44.847 --> 01:56:46.792]  Just keep being arrogant, you Boston boys.
[01:56:47.454 --> 01:56:49.799]  Now, briefly, because I haven't even plugged the shower.
[01:56:51.206 --> 01:56:54.348]  The 25% off the amazing X2.
[01:56:54.829 --> 01:56:57.410]  Everybody's got to research and look into the iodine conspiracy.
[01:56:57.771 --> 01:56:59.692]  What it does to your health when you don't have it.
[01:56:59.732 --> 01:57:01.073]  What it does for your health when you do have it.
[01:57:01.673 --> 01:57:04.135]  IQ, energy, fertility, everything.
[01:57:04.776 --> 01:57:05.396]  X2 25% off.
[01:57:05.556 --> 01:57:10.940]  It's the last few days to get a free bottle of the amazing X3 that I think is just as good.
[01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:11.861]  People love the original.
[01:57:12.261 --> 01:57:16.044]  It's got the deep earth crystal but two other types of iodine that synergistically work together.
[01:57:16.764 --> 01:57:17.845]  Some folks absorb it better.
[01:57:17.945 --> 01:57:22.408]  A free model of Survival Shield X3 with your model of X2.
[01:57:23.128 --> 01:57:23.729]  25% off.
[01:57:24.369 --> 01:57:27.791]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site for all the products.
[01:57:27.851 --> 01:57:31.674]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the sub pages with the amazing supplements.

[01:57:38.999 --> 01:57:41.681]  Mythical Modelman, double the strength of the original.
[01:57:42.582 --> 01:57:43.344]  Super popular.
[01:57:43.685 --> 01:57:45.170]  Secret 12.
[01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:46.133]  50% off out of the gates.
[01:57:46.153 --> 01:57:46.875]  Introductory offer.
[01:57:47.156 --> 01:57:49.684]  Get your bottle of Ultra 12 and defend the Republic.
[01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:58.664]  I cannot say enough nice things about Super Male Vitality right here.
[01:57:58.984 --> 01:58:00.325]  I actually have three of them on my desk.
[01:58:00.345 --> 01:58:01.186]  This is my favorite.
[01:58:01.206 --> 01:58:03.749]  It's heartbreaking that it's going away, I really think.
[01:58:04.129 --> 01:58:05.050]  I mean, really, it's true.
[01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:08.113]  Ever since I've tried these two here, I've also got another one sitting here.
[01:58:08.293 --> 01:58:10.235]  Alpha Power, Super Male Vitality.
[01:58:10.355 --> 01:58:12.958]  They have given me the energy that I did not have.
[01:58:13.358 --> 01:58:17.241]  I mean, my God, I didn't realize how little I was doing before with these two here.
[01:58:17.261 --> 01:58:21.844]  I have the energy to go to the gym at the end of a long day of working at the end of doing a broadcast.
[01:58:21.944 --> 01:58:23.205]  I have the energy to go to a gym.
[01:58:23.285 --> 01:58:26.787]  And frankly, I really think this is better than anything you're going to get in the store.
[01:58:26.827 --> 01:58:27.607]  It's heartbreaking.
[01:58:27.647 --> 01:58:29.869]  The super male vitality is about to go away.
[01:58:29.909 --> 01:58:33.211]  And again, it's just because you can't find the herbs and you don't want to sell us crap.
[01:58:33.251 --> 01:58:34.552]  Yeah, but that's what it's all about.
[01:58:34.572 --> 01:58:35.753]  This is the real deal.
[01:58:35.793 --> 01:58:39.497]  You take two droplets of this a couple times a day, and all of a sudden it's like, whoa!
[01:58:39.717 --> 01:58:40.538]  I'm a man again!
[01:58:40.798 --> 01:58:45.943]  I have all the power that a steady diet of soy fed through government schools robbed me of.
[01:58:46.003 --> 01:58:46.644]  It's back!
[01:58:47.004 --> 01:58:49.647]  So between that, I've got my X2 right here.
[01:58:49.787 --> 01:58:53.811]  Everything else I've tried, I have a filter in my house, a water filter I just bought.
[01:58:53.831 --> 01:58:57.012]  For my family, everybody loves everything in the Infowar store.
[01:58:57.153 --> 01:58:58.753]  Everything is very reasonably priced.
[01:58:58.873 --> 01:58:59.954]  You're supporting the show.
[01:58:59.974 --> 01:59:01.274]  You're supporting the Infowar.
[01:59:01.355 --> 01:59:04.476]  And really, as conservatives, who are you going to give your money to?
[01:59:04.556 --> 01:59:09.899]  Are you going to go to the supplement store and give it to somebody who probably advertises on Roku?
[01:59:10.019 --> 01:59:12.560]  Or are you going to give your money directly to Alex Jones?
[01:59:12.600 --> 01:59:13.860]  It's an easy choice, I think.
[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:15.541]  These are exciting times we live in.
[01:59:15.661 --> 01:59:19.663]  And yes, super male vitality or female vitality is an aging process.
[01:59:19.743 --> 01:59:20.403]  It's cold-pressed.
[01:59:20.503 --> 01:59:21.644]  It takes three to four times more
[01:59:21.664 --> 01:59:25.946]  More of the herbs to do it, and it's super, super strong for libido, stamina, energy.
[01:59:26.026 --> 01:59:31.848]  When I first heard about it, like six, seven years ago, that it was being developed, and I actually tried it, I was like, okay, this actually works.
[01:59:31.989 --> 01:59:36.110]  But I mean, I lost 60, 70 pounds with the X2 and with the Super Mental Vitality.
[01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:38.251]  I've gained a few pounds back because I barely work out anymore.
[01:59:38.351 --> 01:59:44.534]  And if I wasn't taking it, and wasn't taking the X2 and X3, I would definitely be pushing 300 pounds right now.
[01:59:44.774 --> 01:59:49.596]  So get your Super Mental Vitality, the final run, unless me squeezing them makes it way down on the price.
[01:59:49.696 --> 01:59:50.917]  So get it today while you still can.
[01:59:55.362 --> 02:00:01.307]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.158 --> 02:00:19.322]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:00:19.803 --> 02:00:22.145]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:00:32.763 --> 02:00:46.557]  Alright, we're gonna go to Jeffrey in Canada, and Andrew, and Lander, and Josh, and Mike, and Leslie, and Nick, and Ryan, and so many others.
[02:00:47.098 --> 02:00:49.420]  But Mike in Texas, the head of Gavin McInnes joining us.
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:54.785]  Let's talk about Commander-in-Chief Trump, indictments, criminal charges, what Trump needs to do, what's on your mind.
[02:00:54.825 --> 02:00:55.366]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:56.380 --> 02:00:57.681]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:00:57.781 --> 02:01:00.543]  I do appreciate everything y'all do and support you when I can.
[02:01:00.583 --> 02:01:01.684]  Thank you, sir.
[02:01:02.024 --> 02:01:05.467]  There's three things that you didn't cover and stuff that are very important.
[02:01:05.507 --> 02:01:17.796]  Number one, Trump needs to start looking into the exact limits of his executive authority under not only being commander in chief, but just the limits of his office, what he can and what he can get away with doing.
[02:01:18.517 --> 02:01:23.521]  Number two, he needs to stop telegraphing what he's going to do and just do it.
[02:01:23.901 --> 02:01:26.223]  And then after the fact, tell people why he did it.
[02:01:27.119 --> 02:01:30.241]  Because perception is reality to these people.
[02:01:31.201 --> 02:01:37.104]  They want to create a false perception of anything that they do, and they have to tell you about it.
[02:01:37.565 --> 02:01:39.005]  Trump needs to quit telegraphing it.
[02:01:39.085 --> 02:01:40.006]  That's the third thing.
[02:01:40.606 --> 02:01:56.575]  But most important and stuff, the president just needs to take the gloves off and start putting people in jail, you know, and get the Justice Department off their butts to quit investigating and looking into these things and start taking some action.
[02:01:57.330 --> 02:02:04.892]  Even if it turns out and stuff to blow up in his face, at least he'll be perceived as doing something instead of just tweeting and talking about it.
[02:02:05.492 --> 02:02:06.652]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:02:06.752 --> 02:02:08.912]  We have to realize they're not stopping their attempted coup.
[02:02:09.973 --> 02:02:11.153]  And it's not just Trump's right.
[02:02:11.213 --> 02:02:17.314]  It's his duty to defend the border and to secure the elections and all of it.
[02:02:17.954 --> 02:02:18.955]  And they're never going to stop.
[02:02:19.295 --> 02:02:23.275]  And so, again, the swamp still keeps trying to, like, act like it wants to compromise.
[02:02:23.315 --> 02:02:24.916]  And so Trump acts like compromising with it.
[02:02:24.956 --> 02:02:25.696]  It's not going to compromise.
[02:02:28.069 --> 02:02:28.830]  This is so true.
[02:02:30.051 --> 02:02:45.185]  I noticed I haven't really heard a lot of your program, but we also still have a problem and stuff with people that are speaking out and being activists and stuff are still either quote-unquote suiciding themselves or disappearing or dying off.
[02:02:45.205 --> 02:02:45.966]  So I really want to
[02:02:47.057 --> 02:02:47.637]  I hear you.
[02:03:17.818 --> 02:03:19.018]  Hi Alex, great for you to take my call.
[02:03:19.038 --> 02:03:20.319]  I really appreciate it.
[02:03:20.339 --> 02:03:24.242]  I called during the AMA in March and it's great to talk to you again.
[02:03:39.924 --> 02:03:46.671]  Listen, in regards to the election meddling, I don't know if you remember, but I think her name is Deb Harris.
[02:03:46.711 --> 02:03:47.772]  You had her on a couple of times.
[02:03:47.792 --> 02:03:48.393]  Yeah, black box voting.
[02:03:48.413 --> 02:03:49.974]  She's a liberal, non-partisan.
[02:03:49.994 --> 02:03:52.697]  She says that they tried to steal the election from Trump in 2016.
[02:03:53.578 --> 02:03:54.799]  I don't think they ever stopped that.
[02:03:54.819 --> 02:03:57.002]  I think they kept doing it and they're going to do that again.
[02:03:57.042 --> 02:04:02.187]  And I think that's like the biggest non-talked about thing in just all the public consciousness.
[02:04:02.327 --> 02:04:02.968]  Like, I think
[02:04:03.647 --> 02:04:07.148]  That is a really big thing they're going to use to seal the election.
[02:04:07.188 --> 02:04:10.769]  Doesn't Soros and a whole bunch of other people own stock in these companies?
[02:04:10.829 --> 02:04:15.850]  He owns a controlling interest in the largest company that about half the voting is done in the U.S.
[02:04:16.250 --> 02:04:17.931]  It's unbelievable just how brazen they are.
[02:04:18.731 --> 02:04:25.332]  It's ridiculous and I feel that that's an issue that needs to be raised to people like Trump and the others around him that are on our side.
[02:04:26.593 --> 02:04:31.754]  To capitalize on what your first caller and Tom Papert and what I spoke about last time
[02:04:32.355 --> 02:04:34.916]  The neocons, you just mentioned it, big threat.
[02:04:35.256 --> 02:04:40.039]  Again, I think they're more dangerous than they are enablers of the leftists.
[02:04:40.079 --> 02:04:47.723]  They systematically enable them and we need to, you know, keep raising that because I think... I totally agree, Andrew.
[02:04:47.743 --> 02:04:50.084]  I could talk to you all day, but Gavin McGinnis is coming up.
[02:04:50.664 --> 02:04:52.425]  And yes, his brother is going to join us as well.
[02:04:52.445 --> 02:04:53.605]  His brother is a crazy leftist.
[02:04:54.806 --> 02:04:55.907]  We'll take your calls too.
[02:04:56.207 --> 02:04:56.907]  Don't anybody hang up.
[02:04:57.267 --> 02:04:58.148]  Gavin McGinnis coming up.
[02:04:58.168 --> 02:04:58.488]  Stay with us.

[02:06:08.949 --> 02:06:12.773]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[02:06:16.136 --> 02:06:29.428]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[02:06:33.337 --> 02:06:34.718]  Russian scum!
[02:06:34.738 --> 02:06:39.159]  It always comes to mind.
[02:06:43.361 --> 02:06:44.701]  Your reputation's amazing.
[02:06:45.142 --> 02:06:46.462]  I will not let you down.
[02:06:46.622 --> 02:06:49.483]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[02:07:07.216 --> 02:07:18.683]  Gavin McInnes, founder of Vice, journalist, comedian, one of the most banned people in the world, joins us.
[02:07:18.703 --> 02:07:20.484]  We'll continue with your calls throughout the hour.
[02:07:22.325 --> 02:07:28.589]  And when you hear them talk about Gavin on the news, they go, this far-right extremist
[02:07:29.637 --> 02:07:30.417]  A hate figure?
[02:07:31.018 --> 02:07:39.221]  Well, remember, we got the emails a month and a half ago when Facebook had the media internally lobbying to ban us off the air.
[02:07:39.742 --> 02:07:55.209]  They said, if we could designate Jones as a hate figure, like Kevin McInnes, then we could just say you can't even say his name unless it's in a negative light.
[02:07:56.803 --> 02:08:01.664]  And of course, everybody from Sean Hannity to the President, Tucker Carlson, has covered this and just said, this is insane!
[02:08:02.884 --> 02:08:04.264]  So they don't just silence you.
[02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:09.005]  They then lie about you once they've done it.
[02:08:09.065 --> 02:08:11.946]  And so I've got all the articles, the internal emails, and all of it.
[02:08:11.966 --> 02:08:19.167]  We're going to go over this because this is such a big deal because now they've designated me as that hate leader.
[02:08:19.227 --> 02:08:20.127]  And guess how they did it?
[02:08:22.187 --> 02:08:26.168]  We now have the letters that were sent out to the media.
[02:08:28.186 --> 02:08:29.926]  They said he had Gavin on.
[02:08:30.366 --> 02:08:31.727]  Now, remember what happened last year.
[02:08:31.747 --> 02:08:32.547]  We're going to walk through this.
[02:08:32.587 --> 02:08:34.447]  In fact, I meant to do it before the show and I got busy and didn't do it.
[02:08:34.887 --> 02:08:38.168]  Guys, type in, Proud Boys Designated Hate Group.
[02:08:39.068 --> 02:08:40.168]  The FBI never said it.
[02:08:40.568 --> 02:08:41.428]  There was no judge.
[02:08:41.728 --> 02:08:42.608]  There was no jury.
[02:08:42.848 --> 02:08:49.510]  But even the FBI, who can't just act like God and say, this is a terror group, didn't say it.
[02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:55.791]  They were just interviewing some FBI agents, like, well, you know, these extremist groups out here, these anti-fun, Proud Boys.
[02:08:56.291 --> 02:08:57.191]  So off of that,
[02:08:58.581 --> 02:09:04.743]  Banking groups, like G2, that works with Interpol, just said, oh my god, an FBI agent said so.
[02:09:05.163 --> 02:09:12.145]  Well, a week later, the FBI came out and said, we did not say Gavin McInnes or his group is an extremist or a terror or a violent group.
[02:09:14.586 --> 02:09:18.747]  And so, they then took him off.
[02:09:19.788 --> 02:09:26.910]  And then now they say, Jones had Gavin on in the internal Facebook documents, Document Cam Shot, please.
[02:09:28.482 --> 02:09:31.885]  And they say, because of that, it's the final straw.
[02:09:32.625 --> 02:09:40.091]  Because I touch Gavin, who has these cooties, now you see anyone else that talks to me it is.
[02:09:40.211 --> 02:09:43.874]  This is the opposite of innocent until proven guilty.
[02:09:45.135 --> 02:09:48.177]  This is Soviet Union on PCP.
[02:09:48.237 --> 02:09:55.643]  While individuals, posts, or pages created by Infowars Alex Jones have been removed in the past, the full ban comes after Jones hosted Gavin McGinnis.
[02:09:56.698 --> 02:09:58.099]  This is talking points put up by Facebook.
[02:09:58.499 --> 02:10:06.923]  Founder of far-right group, Proud Boys, and a designated hate figure on the platform on a show, a Facebook spokesman said.
[02:10:07.703 --> 02:10:08.464]  And it goes on from there.
[02:10:10.985 --> 02:10:19.729]  And now they've told all their 2.4 billion, I kept saying 2.2 billion, users, if you praise any of these people or defend them, you're banned too, you'll be one.
[02:10:20.089 --> 02:10:20.910]  That's racketeering.
[02:10:20.930 --> 02:10:22.991]  That's such mafia criminal activity.
[02:10:25.575 --> 02:10:29.158]  To list us as all this, and with a straight face, this is Forbes.
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:31.200]  Forbes.
[02:10:32.001 --> 02:10:32.941]  The assassin of truth.
[02:10:35.003 --> 02:10:37.886]  It was Forbes that said that I was banned off YouTube for beating up a 10-year-old child.
[02:10:38.486 --> 02:10:42.570]  Never beat up a 10-year-old, never been arrested, wasn't me in the video, they just defamed me, made it up.
[02:10:43.230 --> 02:10:46.333]  They retracted a week later, though, after the damage was done.
[02:10:51.425 --> 02:10:52.866]  Look at this article out of the BBC.
[02:10:53.626 --> 02:11:05.253]  The Facebook memo said that Jones had hosted on his program Gavin McInnes, leader of the Proud Boys, whose members are known for racist, anti-Muslim, and misogynistic rhetoric.
[02:11:05.854 --> 02:11:08.795]  Mr. McInnes has been designated a hate figure.
[02:11:08.815 --> 02:11:16.240]  And that all came out of the Southern Property Law Center saying he's now suing them and their whole operation is falling apart as the rats
[02:11:16.860 --> 02:11:18.281]  Leave the sinking ship.
[02:11:18.602 --> 02:11:20.183]  Gavin, thank you for coming on.
[02:11:20.203 --> 02:11:29.491]  I guess I'm in even more trouble, because people are going to be able to actually hear what you have to say, and hear what I say, and, you know, learn that none of what they say about you is true.
[02:11:29.711 --> 02:11:33.214]  I'd almost call you a classical liberal, not even a right-winger.
[02:11:33.254 --> 02:11:35.436]  I mean, what would you call yourself?
[02:11:35.456 --> 02:11:36.216]  What would you call me?
[02:11:36.257 --> 02:11:42.562]  I mean, this is so Orwellian, it makes me wonder, is this really a simulation?
[02:11:44.011 --> 02:11:45.092]  You want to talk or will you?
[02:11:45.172 --> 02:11:48.774]  Remember when Laura Loomer was on your show and she was having a breakdown.
[02:11:48.854 --> 02:11:50.995]  She was saying, I don't know what to do.
[02:11:53.116 --> 02:11:53.356]  What?
[02:11:54.497 --> 02:11:54.837]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:54.857 --> 02:11:55.217]  We're live.
[02:11:58.078 --> 02:11:58.519]  Can you hear me?
[02:11:58.859 --> 02:12:01.160]  Yeah, I'm not sure what's going on with our audio, but you're live.
[02:12:02.861 --> 02:12:04.342]  OK, so you can hear me OK.
[02:12:04.482 --> 02:12:05.182]  I hear you great.
[02:12:05.222 --> 02:12:05.943]  Just go ahead and start over.
[02:12:07.283 --> 02:12:07.523]  All right.
[02:12:08.024 --> 02:12:10.685]  So Laura Loomer was freaking out on your show, right?
[02:12:10.705 --> 02:12:12.066]  And she was saying, I don't know what to do, Alex.
[02:12:12.842 --> 02:12:14.843]  We wanted to discuss that on our show.
[02:12:14.903 --> 02:12:15.963]  I'm banking up a bunch of shows.
[02:12:16.003 --> 02:12:17.384]  I got a new project launching soon.
[02:12:18.044 --> 02:12:23.326]  And the only place I could find that footage on YouTube was making fun of her.
[02:12:23.346 --> 02:12:27.088]  It was a cartoon clip where the ghost, space ghost, is mocking her.
[02:12:27.508 --> 02:12:36.732]  So, they're controlling the narrative to the point where the only way you can discuss me, you, Paul Joseph Watson, Miley Yiannopoulos, any of these people, is to lampoon them.
[02:12:36.792 --> 02:12:37.492]  If you were to say,
[02:12:38.052 --> 02:12:39.874]  I don't know, Alex Jones seems like a decent guy.
[02:12:39.934 --> 02:12:44.858]  Or even if you were to say, I don't even understand what exactly is the problem with conspiracy theories?
[02:12:44.878 --> 02:12:47.000]  Aren't they just theories about people conspiring?
[02:12:47.320 --> 02:12:48.441]  That would get banned.
[02:12:49.002 --> 02:12:51.484]  So the only way you can discuss us is to criticize us.
[02:12:51.744 --> 02:12:55.768]  You compare it to Soviet Russia, I think we've gone beyond that.
[02:12:55.948 --> 02:13:00.872]  Soviet Russia would allow you to go on a gulag and you could pay your penance.
[02:13:01.252 --> 02:13:02.454]  This is irrevocable.
[02:13:02.714 --> 02:13:03.995]  We are verboten forever.
[02:13:07.266 --> 02:13:10.790]  We sit here in this position being tyrannized.
[02:13:11.310 --> 02:13:19.998]  And if you study history, once a tyranny gets people in the capacity of accepting it by incrementalism, people pretty much always end up succumbing to it.
[02:13:20.018 --> 02:13:22.260]  I mean, this is a really dark, dangerous time.
[02:13:24.611 --> 02:13:30.115]  Yeah, and they're basing their views on us, on what our critics have to say about us.
[02:13:30.595 --> 02:13:35.498]  So it's like if you want to get an opinion on the Yankees, you talk to a Mets fan.
[02:13:35.819 --> 02:13:38.160]  Well, Mets fans hate the Yankees.
[02:13:38.621 --> 02:13:41.022]  And they go, you see, the Yankees are hate figures.
[02:13:41.102 --> 02:13:42.463]  The Yankees are a hate team.
[02:13:42.743 --> 02:13:44.164]  And you go, have you ever seen them play?
[02:13:44.445 --> 02:13:45.565]  Like, have you ever watched a game?
[02:13:45.605 --> 02:13:47.727]  No, they've never heard us in context.
[02:13:48.067 --> 02:13:49.128]  And there's a plethora
[02:13:49.628 --> 02:13:54.670]  Of content out there where you and I are saying things in context, but they're not interested in that.
[02:13:55.230 --> 02:13:57.031]  They're profoundly incurious.
[02:13:57.351 --> 02:14:02.052]  So they just take the comedian's soundbite, where he said, I hate this guy because of this little blip.
[02:14:02.072 --> 02:14:07.494]  And we've seen guys like Jim Jefferies take Abiyamini out of context and make him into some sort of hate figure.
[02:14:07.795 --> 02:14:09.015]  And they go, good, I'm running with it.
[02:14:09.804 --> 02:14:11.825]  I don't think they even believe it.
[02:14:12.065 --> 02:14:17.488]  I think they just go, I need fodder to prove that the Yankees suck, so I'm just going to take this Mets fan's word.
[02:14:17.688 --> 02:14:19.049]  I don't really care about baseball.
[02:14:19.309 --> 02:14:20.910]  They don't care about the truth.
[02:14:21.250 --> 02:14:23.972]  They just want to run with this juvenile narrative.
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:36.612]  Well, yeah, they're authoritarians, and they're making their move, and big tech's allied with dying corporate media and dying political systems and the chi-coms and the EU and Hollywood and all this, and they're just going, yeah, we're thugs.
[02:14:37.153 --> 02:14:42.498]  We're making our move, and now they're saying we're going to take your banking away, we're going to harass you at your house.
[02:14:42.518 --> 02:14:44.340]  I mean, it's happening to me, it's happening to you.
[02:14:44.901 --> 02:14:46.443]  They are really, really pushing it, Gavin.
[02:14:46.463 --> 02:14:47.504]  Where do you think all this goes?
[02:14:50.652 --> 02:14:53.893]  We have to start our own pirate ships and fight back.
[02:14:53.993 --> 02:15:04.517]  You know, the movie that we just did together, I was just watching it today and I was kind of discouraged watching myself because they did it right after I was fired and I was definitely at a low point.
[02:15:04.537 --> 02:15:10.820]  It's before you gave me that pep talk and said we can rebuild him and it was before I realized what a clown world we're living in.
[02:15:11.761 --> 02:15:14.565]  And I'm very different now.
[02:15:14.605 --> 02:15:15.386]  I'm ready to fight.
[02:15:15.446 --> 02:15:16.528]  I box every morning.
[02:15:16.889 --> 02:15:17.690]  I'm in it to win it.
[02:15:18.110 --> 02:15:23.739]  And back then it was like the second round and I was lying on the mat thinking there's no future here.
[02:15:23.979 --> 02:15:25.161]  But I feel differently now.
[02:15:26.368 --> 02:15:32.750]  They're just making us stronger, they're making us more resilient, and I feel like I'm a better fighter for all of this abuse.
[02:15:33.210 --> 02:15:35.050]  No, I totally, I absolutely agree.
[02:15:35.291 --> 02:15:43.613]  Let's talk about this new film, which is independent that you're in, I'm in, and three other people that have been these underpersons that is now only available
[02:15:44.093 --> 02:15:45.955]  at Vimeo for download or saving.
[02:15:46.055 --> 02:15:47.837]  Everybody is an act of resistance.
[02:15:48.117 --> 02:15:53.762]  Should go to CensoredMovie.com and download the film and save it and show it to others today.
[02:15:54.262 --> 02:16:00.308]  CensoredMovie.com with Alex Jones, Gab McGinnis and so many others like Tommy Robinson.
[02:16:06.642 --> 02:16:12.045]  I'm here in my parents' kitchen because my house flooded with torrential rains this week.
[02:16:12.806 --> 02:16:15.548]  So the flooded part of the house, they're having to fix that, so I've been staying over here.
[02:16:16.828 --> 02:16:23.432]  And I looked in my parents' cupboard and found that they were stocked up on some of the InfoWars Life products.
[02:16:23.452 --> 02:16:24.253]  And I thought, wait a minute.
[02:16:24.913 --> 02:16:30.857]  I've been thinking about coming over to their house, because their kitchen's nicer than mine, and shooting a video about how amazing these products are.
[02:16:31.397 --> 02:16:34.519]  So I called Drew, one of our great camera people over at InfoWars this morning.
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:40.304]  I said, hey, why don't you meet me over here and I'm going to shoot a video I've been meaning to do for probably a year.
[02:16:40.384 --> 02:16:41.605]  So I'm like, I've got everything right here.
[02:16:42.892 --> 02:16:44.453]  It's time to show you what I personally do.
[02:16:44.933 --> 02:16:46.033]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:16:46.914 --> 02:16:56.217]  When I remember to take the supplements religiously, I lose weight, I'm healthy, my skin gets great, I have better stamina, libido, energy.
[02:16:56.878 --> 02:16:57.918]  I've never been a supplements guy.
[02:16:57.938 --> 02:17:02.220]  A lot of my big sponsors were supplement people, and I thought, well, why don't I try these then?
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:03.600]  And it turned out they were really good.
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:07.142]  So we came out, as you know, six years ago with our own line of supplements.
[02:17:07.162 --> 02:17:08.522]  We've been expanding it ever since.
[02:17:08.542 --> 02:17:09.923]  And what we do is,
[02:17:10.823 --> 02:17:17.546]  Set out to already find what's the highest rated, already find what's the cleanest, what's the best, and then make it better, and then cut the price.
[02:17:18.106 --> 02:17:19.707]  And that's what we've done with these products.
[02:17:19.967 --> 02:17:29.911]  And that's why InfoWare's live products are so highly rated by third-party sites, that's why they're so popular with you, and it's also great because it funds our political operations, trying to stop the technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[02:17:30.852 --> 02:17:36.034]  But, I always start taking the supplements, and then I forget to take them.
[02:17:36.274 --> 02:17:37.175]  I either run out,
[02:17:38.300 --> 02:17:41.764]  Or, I just get busy and then all of a sudden I'm not taking DNA Force.
[02:17:42.225 --> 02:17:43.947]  All of a sudden, I'm not taking X2.
[02:17:43.987 --> 02:17:45.649]  I'm not taking Secret 12.
[02:17:46.290 --> 02:17:58.164]  That's why it's important for everybody out there that already knows they got great results with these high quality products at 4-H Life or other supplements you've been taking to remember how good they were for you and your family and to get back into it.
[02:17:58.704 --> 02:18:06.091]  So today I just wanted to encourage everybody that's gotten great results with these products to just remember that because I need that reminder as well.
[02:18:06.612 --> 02:18:12.878]  One of the biggest things is I tend to go to the warehouse and get some of the products out for myself and then those run out and I forget.
[02:18:13.459 --> 02:18:15.260]  So now what I do, what my parents do,
[02:18:16.261 --> 02:18:21.925]  And other people I know is they just put it on auto ship and then fullwarslife.com, get an additional 10% off.
[02:18:21.985 --> 02:18:31.271]  And then you don't forget each month or every two months, however much you want to have it shipped to you to get the product, support the show, and of course, also get 10% off.
[02:18:31.791 --> 02:18:38.516]  Now, some of the things I do is I don't really like soft drinks because I got so much sugar in them and I already have a problem with sweets sometimes.
[02:18:39.296 --> 02:18:41.718]  So, I really like soft drinks, what I'm trying to say is.
[02:18:42.578 --> 02:18:43.820]  I don't like the effects they have on me.
[02:18:44.441 --> 02:18:50.951]  So what I do is take something like a Perrier, lime or non-flavored, and I put it into a nice glass.
[02:18:52.854 --> 02:18:56.059]  And then I take the Ultra 12,
[02:18:58.291 --> 02:19:03.074]  And put in a whole dropper, and then I stir it up, and the flavor is incredible.
[02:19:03.534 --> 02:19:18.444]  So again, take your favorite sparkling water that doesn't have any calories in it, either flavored or unflavored, it all goes great with the flavor of natural vitamin B12 that has a sweet taste without any sugar or additives.
[02:19:18.464 --> 02:19:24.388]  You've got to experience Ultra 12 for yourself, you've got to experience X2 as well, and of course, X3.
[02:19:24.488 --> 02:19:26.209]  That's triiodine.
[02:19:26.889 --> 02:19:28.210]  Different strokes for different folks.
[02:19:28.611 --> 02:19:33.815]  Bottom line, these are all incredible products that have changed my life and changed so many other people's lives.
[02:19:34.235 --> 02:19:42.102]  As I've said over and over again, it then funds an organization dedicated to exposing the globalists and their operations.
[02:19:42.142 --> 02:19:43.583]  That's why I thank you all for your support.
[02:19:43.603 --> 02:19:46.266]  I want to encourage you, if you haven't tried these products, to try them.
[02:19:46.286 --> 02:19:48.347]  And if you have tried them and, again, forgot,
[02:19:49.108 --> 02:19:50.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:14.235 --> 02:20:14.795]  You've got it.
[02:20:14.835 --> 02:20:21.277]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:20:21.357 --> 02:20:23.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:20:25.738 --> 02:20:27.638]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:27.718 --> 02:20:31.439]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:20:32.839 --> 02:20:35.880]  Gavin McInnes just said it all.
[02:20:37.043 --> 02:20:40.025]  He said we've got to create our own little pirate ships like InfoWars.
[02:20:40.906 --> 02:20:43.247]  Our own ecosystems, our own websites, our own platforms.
[02:20:43.928 --> 02:20:47.350]  Because the system is abusing its power, its surveillance, its censorship.
[02:20:48.371 --> 02:20:51.453]  And just like they've destroyed so many patriots in the past, well now...
[02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:55.341]  In the 21st century, we can rebuild them.
[02:20:55.761 --> 02:21:11.608]  And when Gavin was here four months ago or so, and had just been deplatformed, was being lied about, he hadn't countersued yet, he hadn't decided to take action, I am proud of the fact that he stayed a few days, we went out to eat, we hung out, and I put some good whiskey in him and some good tomahawk steaks.
[02:21:13.021 --> 02:21:14.841]  And I said, damn it, son, you're a trailblazer.
[02:21:14.881 --> 02:21:15.382]  You've been a leader.
[02:21:15.402 --> 02:21:16.622]  Everything you've done has been successful.
[02:21:16.922 --> 02:21:18.482]  You're not going to be happy unless you fight back.
[02:21:18.522 --> 02:21:19.462]  They were harassing his wife.
[02:21:19.743 --> 02:21:20.683]  They were stalking his family.
[02:21:20.703 --> 02:21:23.123]  They were calling him a Nazi, taking his bank accounts away.
[02:21:23.603 --> 02:21:23.983]  And you know what?
[02:21:24.024 --> 02:21:24.644]  He fought back.
[02:21:24.704 --> 02:21:25.924]  And now they're even more pissed.
[02:21:26.384 --> 02:21:29.465]  And they're saying, if you support him, we're going to come after you.
[02:21:29.505 --> 02:21:30.005]  Well, you know what?
[02:21:30.045 --> 02:21:31.705]  We're all Spartacus now.
[02:21:31.765 --> 02:21:34.446]  But it's the audience that is in the arena.
[02:21:35.086 --> 02:21:36.847]  This is a place where you're not some passive audience.
[02:21:37.068 --> 02:21:50.899]  When you support us, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy our products, when you watch the films we're in, you are carrying the ball down the field and rubbing it in the eye of the establishment and beating them because they're selling lies and AOC saying the world's ending.
[02:21:51.339 --> 02:21:53.801]  We're selling a future and a reality that works.
[02:21:54.321 --> 02:21:55.142]  Show.
[02:21:55.162 --> 02:21:56.583]  $6 million man, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:56.823 --> 02:21:58.225]  Gab McGinnis, Alex Jones.
[02:21:58.585 --> 02:22:03.149]  We are all, ladies and gentlemen, that $6 million man and it's you that have rebuilt us.
[02:22:03.169 --> 02:22:03.509]  Here it is.
[02:22:04.512 --> 02:22:18.415]  So again folks, we're promoting Americana in the face of the globalists.
[02:22:34.898 --> 02:22:36.258]  Of course they're going to come after us.
[02:22:38.539 --> 02:22:40.339]  But, folks, get that now.
[02:22:40.379 --> 02:22:41.519]  This is 21st Century War.
[02:22:43.160 --> 02:22:45.600]  Info Wars is a flag and the symbol of the fight.
[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:47.081]  They want to capture it.
[02:22:47.221 --> 02:22:47.701]  You get it.
[02:22:48.021 --> 02:22:49.221]  You've been holding the flag up.
[02:22:49.921 --> 02:22:50.561]  Despite hell.
[02:23:26.598 --> 02:23:27.638]  Steve Austin.
[02:23:27.858 --> 02:23:28.559]  Astronaut.
[02:23:28.719 --> 02:23:30.299]  A man barely alive.
[02:23:30.479 --> 02:23:34.521]  Gentlemen, we can rebuild him.
[02:23:34.581 --> 02:23:37.942]  We have the technology.
[02:23:38.002 --> 02:23:45.405]  We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man.
[02:23:45.425 --> 02:23:48.266]  Steve Austin will be that man.
[02:23:48.386 --> 02:23:52.888]  Better than he was before.
[02:23:54.809 --> 02:23:55.029]  Better
[02:24:00.589 --> 02:24:02.991]  All right, so let's get back to Gavin, who's on fire today.
[02:24:03.011 --> 02:24:04.051]  I want to take your calls coming up.
[02:24:04.071 --> 02:24:04.912]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[02:24:05.773 --> 02:24:08.355]  But we're not little bitches here whining about all this.
[02:24:08.395 --> 02:24:09.175]  We're affected.
[02:24:09.635 --> 02:24:15.079]  Gavin has launched major national advertising movements, launched Vice Magazine and TV.
[02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:16.881]  That's why they fear him.
[02:24:17.461 --> 02:24:18.882]  Paul Watson has done incredible things.
[02:24:18.902 --> 02:24:19.562]  That's why they fear him.
[02:24:19.923 --> 02:24:20.723]  I've done amazing things.
[02:24:20.763 --> 02:24:21.824]  Our audience has done amazing things.
[02:24:22.124 --> 02:24:23.845]  Matt Drudge has done unbelievable things.
[02:24:24.345 --> 02:24:26.126]  We're the good guys, dammit.
[02:24:26.166 --> 02:24:26.687]  We've proven it.
[02:24:27.047 --> 02:24:29.408]  And we've delivered Trump, and he's delivered a lot so far.
[02:24:29.709 --> 02:24:30.369]  He's embattled.
[02:24:30.409 --> 02:24:30.989]  We've got to do more.
[02:24:31.009 --> 02:24:33.511]  But audience, I'm going to go back to you again.
[02:24:33.671 --> 02:24:36.673]  Dammit, do you know how amazing you are and what you've done?
[02:24:37.253 --> 02:24:41.236]  And so we're in this fight still together, but I'm telling you, it's an incredible time, Gavin.
[02:24:42.970 --> 02:24:55.102]  Yeah, you know, one thing I want to make clear, too, is I think a lot of us are decent human beings on the right, and conservatives and Christians, and we, as they dehumanize us, we humanize them.
[02:24:55.242 --> 02:25:02.809]  And we, like in that movie, we see Tommy Robinson has had to relocate his family again, and he may have to leave the country entirely.
[02:25:03.129 --> 02:25:04.731]  I want to make something very clear to the right.
[02:25:05.131 --> 02:25:07.794]  You know that the left sees that as a victory, right?
[02:25:07.814 --> 02:25:11.118]  That the left has gone way past empathy or sympathy.
[02:25:11.439 --> 02:25:14.002]  Now they're about nothing but vindictive revenge.
[02:25:14.282 --> 02:25:16.966]  And I think a lot of us go, hey man, look at Dana Lash.
[02:25:17.226 --> 02:25:19.529]  She had to pack up overnight and move to a whole new state.
[02:25:19.709 --> 02:25:20.570]  Oh yeah, oh listen, listen.
[02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:21.511]  I'm not relocating.
[02:25:21.531 --> 02:25:23.514]  You come to my house being violent, I'll blow your head off.
[02:25:26.004 --> 02:25:27.748]  And I'm not putting Tommy down, he's got a lot of courage.
[02:25:28.169 --> 02:25:29.713]  But I get him wanting to protect his daughters.
[02:25:30.535 --> 02:25:34.004]  It's just that, you know, people of you know, you come mean to me, Harm, you're gonna die.
[02:25:34.024 --> 02:25:34.846]  So, go ahead.
[02:25:36.178 --> 02:25:37.298]  These people are ruthless.
[02:25:37.338 --> 02:25:38.419]  They want us dead.
[02:25:38.619 --> 02:25:42.200]  And when they see us suffering, they love every minute of it.
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:48.281]  If Ann Coulter died, there would be hilarious memes about her before her body was cold.
[02:25:48.301 --> 02:25:49.502]  They did it to Roger Ailes.
[02:25:49.802 --> 02:25:53.283]  We are dealing with an unprecedented vindictiveness.
[02:25:53.503 --> 02:25:57.884]  It started with daddy issues, and now it's down to people who... But you just said it.
[02:25:57.904 --> 02:25:58.984]  I'm gonna give you the floor next segment.
[02:25:59.004 --> 02:26:00.304]  But they have no chivalry.
[02:26:00.584 --> 02:26:02.205]  They have no sense of decency.
[02:26:02.785 --> 02:26:04.308]  Because you don't want bad stuff happening to you.
[02:26:04.348 --> 02:26:06.391]  You don't want your kids in the fight so you don't mess with their kids.
[02:26:06.672 --> 02:26:07.553]  It's a normal instinct.
[02:26:07.753 --> 02:26:08.935]  They have no bottom.
[02:26:08.955 --> 02:26:09.797]  What's wrong with them?
[02:26:11.175 --> 02:26:19.000]  Well, when they hear something like, you know, our children are being threatened, our children are in danger, their takeaway with that is, well, he shouldn't have put his kids in danger.
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:19.640]  What a dummy.
[02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:22.542]  Tommy Robinson shouldn't have done that to his kids.
[02:26:23.022 --> 02:26:26.864]  So they are incapable of seeing any kind of humanity.
[02:26:26.884 --> 02:26:27.945]  And we have to recognize that.
[02:26:27.985 --> 02:26:29.406]  We have to know our enemy.
[02:26:29.746 --> 02:26:32.447]  And our enemy is devoid of empathy.
[02:26:32.547 --> 02:26:35.109]  Our enemy is purely ruthless.
[02:26:37.156 --> 02:26:44.725]  And I see with this in my life, the weak who are given petty power are always the biggest abusers, the biggest war criminals.
[02:26:45.006 --> 02:26:54.197]  The really strong tend to have a built-in chivalry or a governor, and there's just something about the left of how pathetic they are that they'll just do anything.
[02:26:56.209 --> 02:26:59.210]  Well, they want to normalize the freaks because they're freaks.
[02:26:59.270 --> 02:27:14.915]  How many Antifa have been arrested for disgusting sexual behavior like Mika Rhodes, the head of Portland Antifa, who had raped several couples, young men and women, pre-adolescent men, boys and girls.
[02:27:15.315 --> 02:27:21.697]  And you realize, oh, the reason that you're trying to destroy society is that you are incompatible.
[02:27:22.037 --> 02:27:23.117]  with normal society.
[02:27:23.157 --> 02:27:25.298]  So you want to make us all evil freaks.
[02:27:25.578 --> 02:27:34.101]  The idea that they're calling all these people racist, putting Proud Boys in jail who have black wives, this has nothing to do with Nazis, nothing to do with truth.
[02:27:34.401 --> 02:27:37.323]  This is all about crushing the enemy and crushing Trump.
[02:27:37.383 --> 02:27:38.443]  And if you support Trump,
[02:27:39.043 --> 02:27:45.165]  And you're even mildly influential, they have to lie about you and try to destroy you.
[02:27:45.566 --> 02:27:48.467]  And the only solution is to fight back.
[02:27:48.527 --> 02:27:51.908]  Because if you don't fight back, they'll keep treading on you.
[02:27:53.168 --> 02:27:54.969]  And that, Gavin, is your big crime.
[02:27:54.989 --> 02:27:57.510]  We'll talk about that and go to calls when we come back and talk about the new film you're in.
[02:27:58.755 --> 02:28:20.083]  The big crime is, Proud Boys goes out, Western chauvinism, black, white, gay, straight, whatever, you go out there, Antifa keeps attacking you 10 to 1, you beat their asses, and the crime is, is that they're so pathetic, you're supposed to bow to the meth-head professors, and let them beat you in the head with a club, but instead you don't let them beat up women and children, they attack you, you kick their ass every time, they can't stand it.
[02:28:20.103 --> 02:28:24.044]  I mean, they're such villains, you think in a fight sometimes they'd win, no!
[02:28:24.284 --> 02:28:25.925]  They're that pathetic, they're scum!
[02:28:28.843 --> 02:28:31.125]  Well, and this whole idea of a hate group.
[02:28:31.746 --> 02:28:32.707]  What is a hate group?
[02:28:32.967 --> 02:28:34.188]  What is a hate figure?
[02:28:34.448 --> 02:28:36.430]  There's no logic to it at all.
[02:28:36.510 --> 02:28:38.772]  It's just silly, pedantic rhetoric.
[02:28:38.812 --> 02:28:39.673]  We all know the truth.
[02:28:39.713 --> 02:28:43.937]  The truth is that Antifa is the DNC's paramilitary wing.
[02:28:43.997 --> 02:28:45.219]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[02:28:45.239 --> 02:28:47.000]  You're right, they're totally protected.
[02:28:47.981 --> 02:28:53.408]  The big unspoken law is you don't mess with the meth-head army, pedophile army.
[02:28:53.809 --> 02:28:57.153]  You bow down to them, you worship the meth-head, anti-foe army.
[02:28:57.354 --> 02:28:59.677]  But they've actually now been officially listed as terrorists.
[02:29:00.578 --> 02:29:01.199]  Proud Boys hasn't.
[02:29:03.184 --> 02:29:05.046]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[02:29:05.126 --> 02:29:09.890]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[02:29:09.910 --> 02:29:13.512]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[02:29:13.613 --> 02:29:17.576]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[02:29:17.696 --> 02:29:20.718]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[02:29:20.838 --> 02:29:27.944]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[02:29:28.044 --> 02:29:28.544]  Dangerous.
[02:29:28.604 --> 02:29:29.145]  Dangerous.
[02:29:29.185 --> 02:29:29.665]  Dangerous.
[02:29:29.705 --> 02:29:30.326]  Dangerous.
[02:29:30.866 --> 02:29:31.987]  Dangerous individuals.
[02:29:32.007 --> 02:29:33.128]  Dangerous individuals.
[02:29:33.208 --> 02:29:35.330]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[02:29:35.850 --> 02:29:40.133]  Basically they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[02:29:40.273 --> 02:29:41.314]  They call me dangerous.
[02:29:41.414 --> 02:29:42.835]  Danger is my middle name.
[02:29:43.035 --> 02:29:44.896]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[02:29:45.117 --> 02:29:48.339]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:53.083]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[02:29:53.163 --> 02:29:54.645]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[02:29:54.825 --> 02:29:59.349]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[02:29:59.429 --> 02:30:01.951]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[02:30:02.131 --> 02:30:04.033]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[02:30:04.153 --> 02:30:06.375]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[02:30:06.896 --> 02:30:09.178]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[02:30:09.318 --> 02:30:10.339]  I want them shut down.
[02:30:10.359 --> 02:30:11.341]  I want them silenced.
[02:30:11.381 --> 02:30:12.142]  I want them muted.
[02:30:12.202 --> 02:30:14.044]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:30:14.204 --> 02:30:15.546]  I want them shut down!
[02:30:15.906 --> 02:30:17.048]  I want them silenced!
[02:30:17.148 --> 02:30:17.909]  I want them muted!
[02:30:18.049 --> 02:30:21.213]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[02:30:23.106 --> 02:30:32.149]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[02:30:32.169 --> 02:30:40.912]  And we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[02:30:40.952 --> 02:30:41.712]  Screw your rules.
[02:30:41.972 --> 02:30:45.233]  Your rules go against our values and they are patently un-American.
[02:30:45.354 --> 02:30:47.894]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[02:30:48.415 --> 02:30:52.396]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[02:30:52.776 --> 02:30:55.058]  We need a digital bill of rights.
[02:30:55.138 --> 02:30:58.801]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[02:30:59.041 --> 02:31:06.107]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[02:31:06.247 --> 02:31:07.368]  You are a bad person.
[02:31:07.408 --> 02:31:08.769]  You should be censored off the internet.
[02:31:08.829 --> 02:31:09.430]  Bad, yes.
[02:31:10.010 --> 02:31:10.991]  Get out of here, Alex!
[02:31:11.271 --> 02:31:15.655]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[02:31:15.775 --> 02:31:20.138]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is
[02:31:21.252 --> 02:31:24.555]  I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[02:31:24.876 --> 02:31:29.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:31:30.441 --> 02:31:31.983]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[02:31:41.949 --> 02:31:49.436]  Yeah, I really appreciate you, and it's an honor to talk to you, and I do, before I start, I also wanted to do a plug for a couple of your products that I really love.
[02:31:49.496 --> 02:31:50.137]  Changed my life.
[02:31:50.217 --> 02:31:52.559]  The DNA Force is one, and X2.
[02:31:52.699 --> 02:31:54.401]  Yeah, I do a lot of construction.
[02:31:54.621 --> 02:32:01.988]  Using the tools that you're using, it just really wreaks havoc on your body, and I had three of my fingers starting to go numb, and I didn't think there was anything going to work on it.
[02:32:03.609 --> 02:32:08.751]  Well, thank you, brother.
[02:32:08.771 --> 02:32:16.294]  I mean, we want to sell you stuff that works.
[02:32:16.314 --> 02:32:22.896]  You want to order it again, but PQQ, CoQ10 has been proven to make telomeres last longer, to make nerves regrow.
[02:32:23.036 --> 02:32:25.217]  It really is an amazing product for anybody above 40.
[02:32:25.457 --> 02:32:28.578]  Young people can take it as well, but yes, DNA Force Plus is amazing.
[02:32:29.139 --> 02:32:29.779]  What'd you think of the X2?
[02:32:30.299 --> 02:32:31.500]  I love that too.
[02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:35.401]  After a few months of being on that, I felt like I wasn't searching for words.
[02:32:36.001 --> 02:32:44.465]  There was a time in my life where I felt like, man, I don't know if I'm just too exhausted or what, but you feel like you want to get in a conversation and you're pausing and you can't find the word to say.
[02:32:44.605 --> 02:32:47.726]  And I swear, man, that X2 really helps with cognition.
[02:32:47.766 --> 02:32:50.527]  Well, that's because the synapses in the brain operate off of it.
[02:32:50.547 --> 02:32:51.267]  It's electrochemical.
[02:32:51.287 --> 02:32:52.048]  You're absolutely right.
[02:32:52.108 --> 02:32:55.809]  When I forget to take X2 every couple of days, sometimes I forget for like a week because I get busy.
[02:32:55.909 --> 02:32:58.450]  Then I feel it and I take it and it really is amazing.
[02:32:58.530 --> 02:32:59.691]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[02:33:06.249 --> 02:33:08.952]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:14.717 --> 02:33:15.538]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:15.598 --> 02:33:18.821]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:39.053]  So imagine the year 2019.
[02:33:40.875 --> 02:33:45.880]  Individuals that stand up to armed groups of meth-head thugs wearing masks.
[02:33:46.721 --> 02:33:54.229]  People who just go out and demonstrate and defend women and children are listed by the media as terrorists.
[02:33:55.310 --> 02:34:01.435]  And then everyone then follows suit to then de-platform those individuals, harass them at their homes, even take their bank accounts.
[02:34:01.936 --> 02:34:03.557]  Gavin McInnes is our guest.
[02:34:03.997 --> 02:34:08.841]  We'll take a few phone calls here in a moment on a host of issues of what Trump needs to do, but Gavin, getting into this film,
[02:34:10.003 --> 02:34:14.166]  CensoredMovie.com is where people can download it or where they can watch it.
[02:34:14.186 --> 02:34:15.447]  You can rent it or buy the film.
[02:34:15.907 --> 02:34:24.073]  It supports these great filmmakers who would dare blackball themselves actually talking to un-personed individuals so you can decide for yourself what they actually said.
[02:34:24.393 --> 02:34:26.194]  You Can't Watch This is the name of the film.
[02:34:26.475 --> 02:34:27.375]  YouCan'tWatchThis.com.
[02:34:28.877 --> 02:34:32.779]  Or just go to CensoredMovie.com if you want to download it or stream it.
[02:34:33.419 --> 02:34:38.122]  Very important that everybody understands this is an act of resistance to do that and to share it with others.
[02:34:38.842 --> 02:34:40.903]  But Gavin, getting back to you, other points here.
[02:34:40.923 --> 02:34:47.326]  I've been asking a lot of the questions today, but I want you to get into other topics, other issues that you're focused on.
[02:34:47.386 --> 02:34:48.807]  You also wanted to bring this film up.
[02:34:49.447 --> 02:34:50.508]  What you think Trump should do.
[02:34:50.588 --> 02:34:51.048]  Other points.
[02:34:53.157 --> 02:34:57.138]  Well, I just think that we have to understand what we're up against here.
[02:34:57.559 --> 02:35:01.060]  And I think that the right is too honorable sometimes.
[02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:06.582]  And we go, oh, there's the Antifa nuts, then there's the DNC, then there's the media.
[02:35:07.282 --> 02:35:08.703]  It's all one cabal.
[02:35:08.983 --> 02:35:11.884]  There's just different groups within this one.
[02:35:12.164 --> 02:35:14.325]  The DNC and Antifa are the same.
[02:35:15.485 --> 02:35:22.169]  The prosecutors in our courts are also social justice warriors, taking talking points from the DNC.
[02:35:22.690 --> 02:35:33.757]  Like, after the Proud Boys were arrested in New York, you saw de Blasio, the Attorney General, Governor Cuomo, all saying, oh, this hate group is roaming the streets of New York just beating up random gays and Muslim people.
[02:35:34.137 --> 02:35:35.758]  All total and utter lies.
[02:35:36.178 --> 02:35:38.500]  But you think, okay, well that's just going to stay with that one tweet.
[02:35:38.540 --> 02:35:46.525]  No, that leaked into the prosecution, that leaked into the court system, that leaked into the media, that leaked into Antifa.
[02:35:46.645 --> 02:35:52.128]  It's all the same and I think the crime that Proud Boys committed was saying, alright, we've had enough of this.
[02:35:52.148 --> 02:35:57.111]  We've had enough of you harassing Milo and Ben Shapiro and moderates like Alan Dershowitz.
[02:35:57.171 --> 02:36:01.114]  We're going to protect them, these speakers, from you psychopaths.
[02:36:01.614 --> 02:36:03.134]  And that was a sin.
[02:36:03.154 --> 02:36:09.876]  Like, at Deplorable, they're throwing feces, batteries, and urine at us, and we're the bad guys.
[02:36:09.976 --> 02:36:12.596]  That's the clown world we're living in.
[02:36:13.056 --> 02:36:19.677]  And I remember seeing an interview with the Covenant Catholic school kids, and it was one of the most shocking sentences I've ever heard.
[02:36:19.977 --> 02:36:28.779]  The woman interviewing that kid who stood up to the Indian who was banging a drum in his face, she said, well, standing your ground, that's a little aggressive, don't you think?
[02:36:29.617 --> 02:36:31.099]  And that's where we're at today.
[02:36:31.239 --> 02:36:33.742]  To stand your ground, to say, no, I'm not a Nazi.
[02:36:34.003 --> 02:36:39.309]  To say, no, you're not going to tell me what to think or how to vote or what to say and what words to use.
[02:36:39.329 --> 02:36:40.991]  I'm not going to let you control my life.
[02:36:41.372 --> 02:36:46.058]  That is considered an act of aggression in Trump's America.
[02:36:46.198 --> 02:36:46.899]  It's bizarre.
[02:36:47.543 --> 02:36:56.449]  Well, if you look at the EU or Australia or New Zealand defending yourself from someone raping your wife, attacking you, they'll throw you in prison and let the rapist or attacker go.
[02:36:56.509 --> 02:37:00.131]  So the ultimate crime in the leftist system is fighting back against them.
[02:37:00.592 --> 02:37:02.913]  You're just there to, you know, at the Washington Monument.
[02:37:02.933 --> 02:37:03.854]  You're there on a tour.
[02:37:04.274 --> 02:37:06.796]  People come over to you screaming, you're a white scum, we're going to kill you.
[02:37:06.816 --> 02:37:09.157]  You know, the black Israelites for 30 minutes.
[02:37:09.498 --> 02:37:12.300]  They just edit it together and say, look at these horrible white supremacists.
[02:37:12.780 --> 02:37:16.602]  They were supposed to just, I guess, just run to the hills and not wait for their bus.
[02:37:16.843 --> 02:37:17.443]  Totally sick.
[02:37:19.023 --> 02:37:21.824]  That's the world they want, where we're just constantly running in fear.
[02:37:22.365 --> 02:37:24.885]  And the irony is, okay, I'll constantly run in fear.
[02:37:25.125 --> 02:37:27.706]  Who's going to protect you, you liberal wimps?
[02:37:28.166 --> 02:37:29.047]  You need us.
[02:37:29.087 --> 02:37:32.948]  You need the Archie Bunkers to protect you, because you don't know how to fight.
[02:37:33.048 --> 02:37:34.348]  You don't know how to fight tyranny.
[02:37:34.729 --> 02:37:42.351]  You know, it's very possible that the government is letting this mob rule do all their dirty work, and then once everyone's censored, now they can jump in.
[02:37:42.791 --> 02:37:46.173]  And say, all right, I'll be controlling social media from here on in.
[02:37:46.193 --> 02:37:56.118]  I mean, we're already seeing Congress get involved in Facebook and the lines are blurring between Jack Dorsey, Mark Zuckerberg, and the White House.
[02:37:56.378 --> 02:37:57.979]  You know, I don't know where Trump is in all this.
[02:37:58.359 --> 02:37:59.459]  He seems to be absent.
[02:37:59.479 --> 02:38:00.760]  I guess he's busy on Twitter.
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:07.783]  But we seem to be losing the war with the mob and the war with the system itself.
[02:38:07.824 --> 02:38:10.645]  The government is also on board with these SJWs.
[02:38:11.269 --> 02:38:16.253]  Well, the only good news, though, in all this, Alex, is that they are incompetent boobs.
[02:38:16.313 --> 02:38:17.654]  Like, you look at who they're running with.
[02:38:17.734 --> 02:38:22.797]  Bill de Blasio, the man who's turning New York City into San Francisco homelessville.
[02:38:23.198 --> 02:38:28.101]  Or Pete Buttigieg, some random mayor in some small town who looks like Alfred E. Newman.
[02:38:28.662 --> 02:38:32.064]  Or radicals like Ilhan Omar, who ridicules 9-11.
[02:38:32.745 --> 02:38:35.847]  Or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who wants to get rid of all fossil fuels.
[02:38:36.307 --> 02:38:37.968]  In many ways, they're their own worst enemy.
[02:38:38.129 --> 02:38:39.590]  So I'm so confident Trump's gonna win.
[02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:41.471]  And we will win in the long run.
[02:38:41.511 --> 02:38:45.534]  But right now, today, the lunatics are running the asylum.
[02:38:46.315 --> 02:38:46.735]  No, you're right.
[02:38:46.755 --> 02:38:51.398]  I want to go to some of these calls, but you mentioned the film, and you got cut off by the break earlier.
[02:38:51.438 --> 02:38:57.943]  You were saying you went and saw the film, You Can't Watch This, that you're in, that was shot four months ago or so, your interview, when you were really down.
[02:38:58.744 --> 02:39:01.386]  But I think it's actually poignant and pretty powerful, the parts of the film you're in.
[02:39:01.746 --> 02:39:04.248]  So give us your review of Censored Movie.
[02:39:05.919 --> 02:39:06.579]  Well, I think it's great.
[02:39:06.599 --> 02:39:11.482]  I think the right will see it and go, Jesus, what the hell is going on with this country?
[02:39:11.782 --> 02:39:13.543]  I didn't realize things were that bad.
[02:39:13.843 --> 02:39:19.327]  I didn't realize, and I never say victim, I didn't realize that conservatives were being targeted so much.
[02:39:19.367 --> 02:39:22.448]  These targets are being overrun for what?
[02:39:22.909 --> 02:39:28.412]  They're not Nazis, they're not bigots, so that's what the right and the sane and the curious people will get from it.
[02:39:28.712 --> 02:39:32.334]  But I think a lot of lefties, these vindictive little bitches, are going to go,
[02:39:32.734 --> 02:39:33.434]  Ha ha!
[02:39:33.795 --> 02:39:37.697]  You ruined your life by speaking up against tyranny.
[02:39:37.717 --> 02:39:38.938]  Ha ha!
[02:39:39.838 --> 02:39:41.839]  They're going to enjoy the suffering, I'm afraid.
[02:39:43.540 --> 02:39:43.980]  You're right.
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:45.241]  Okay.
[02:39:45.261 --> 02:39:45.981]  I've got a problem.
[02:39:46.222 --> 02:39:47.242]  I've got so many phone lines.
[02:39:47.262 --> 02:39:49.803]  We get a lot of great calls that I can never get to everybody, but I'm trying here.
[02:39:50.284 --> 02:39:54.726]  Jeffrey in Canada, Trump's focus on the Fed and taking action on speech.
[02:39:55.126 --> 02:39:56.527]  I'm going to go to some other callers that are holding.
[02:39:57.007 --> 02:39:59.549]  Jeffrey in Canada, you're on the air with Gavin McInnes and myself.
[02:39:59.829 --> 02:40:00.449]  Thanks for holding.
[02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:01.050]  Thanks for calling.
[02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:01.310]  Go ahead.
[02:40:02.287 --> 02:40:07.991]  Well, it's an honor to be on the show, and I want to thank you and Gavin and the crew at InfoWars.
[02:40:08.431 --> 02:40:14.235]  And earlier in the broadcast, you mentioned, what are you doing, you know, out to the audience?
[02:40:14.295 --> 02:40:16.856]  And one of the things I've been doing is I listen to your show.
[02:40:16.956 --> 02:40:23.020]  I've even purchased some of your products, and I've decided to do my own website and speak out about what's happening.
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:25.762]  And the free speech part is so critical.
[02:40:25.802 --> 02:40:27.203]  If you can't talk to each other,
[02:40:27.734 --> 02:40:32.618]  In a living room or in a bedroom or in a school, then how can you get any progress?
[02:40:32.738 --> 02:40:41.705]  And so for what I think Trump should do is that he should basically do some sort of executive action to take the Internet back.
[02:40:41.765 --> 02:40:45.428]  Because if he's able to reconsolidate the Internet back into the U.S.
[02:40:45.468 --> 02:40:53.074]  system, it could literally take and basically almost break the back of the social credit system that's being rolled out worldwide.
[02:40:53.094 --> 02:40:55.156]  And this whole thing about unpersoning people
[02:40:55.831 --> 02:40:56.231]  I don't know.
[02:41:22.372 --> 02:41:25.794]  He says that there's the weakness and incompetence of the United Nations.
[02:41:26.354 --> 02:41:30.396]  It's something that he's going to be... Exactly.
[02:41:30.416 --> 02:41:31.057]  You just said it.
[02:41:31.197 --> 02:41:37.441]  Obama handed the internet over as soon as Trump got elected when he was a lame duck to sabotage things.
[02:41:37.501 --> 02:41:39.102]  And so it's not even about a censorship issue.
[02:41:39.782 --> 02:41:40.462]  That's important.
[02:41:40.763 --> 02:41:48.587]  For me, it's about the fact that we're letting foreign powers come in and take our rights and having Facebook and everybody else line up with their regulations.
[02:41:48.887 --> 02:41:50.628]  And Congress goes, it's a private company.
[02:41:51.129 --> 02:41:52.149]  Europe's not doing that.
[02:41:52.490 --> 02:41:53.130]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:53.170 --> 02:41:53.990]  Great point, Jeffrey.
[02:41:54.511 --> 02:41:54.771]  Gavin?
[02:41:56.690 --> 02:42:12.437]  Yeah, you know, another thing that's shocking about all of this censorship is their worst fear, the worst thing you could do, worse than being Alex Jones, worse than being a hate figure, the worst thing you could do right now is encourage debate between the right and the left.
[02:42:12.537 --> 02:42:22.161]  To show, you know, Cornel West and Milo Yiannopoulos, or to show Roger Stone and Cenk Uygur, to show Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley sitting together
[02:42:22.641 --> 02:42:24.682]  In a room discussing Trump's America.
[02:42:25.022 --> 02:42:26.623]  That's their ultimate nightmare.
[02:42:26.683 --> 02:42:32.285]  Because that will show the rest of the country that the right are not lunatic white nationalists.
[02:42:32.305 --> 02:42:33.806]  They're actually quite rational.
[02:42:34.106 --> 02:42:39.228]  And to show our similarities is the worst thing you could possibly do for the left.
[02:42:39.348 --> 02:42:42.789]  Because they've managed to make us into Gargamel from the Smurfs.
[02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:47.311]  And to have Gargamel sit down with a Smurf is the end of their crazy narrative.
[02:42:47.671 --> 02:42:48.592]  You said it.
[02:42:48.632 --> 02:42:51.373]  They need to project their lies on the Tea Party, Trump, everybody.
[02:42:51.733 --> 02:42:55.758]  That's why they're so desperate to shut down communications, is because they know they're very close to losing.
[02:42:56.039 --> 02:42:57.761]  More calls with Gavin McInnes, straight ahead.
[02:42:57.781 --> 02:42:58.162]  Stay with us.
[02:43:09.235 --> 02:43:11.716]  Support the broadcast that tell the truth.
[02:43:12.116 --> 02:43:15.418]  Support the broadcast and do it as an act of will against the enemy.
[02:43:15.718 --> 02:43:20.200]  If they can shut this broadcast down, they have victory over free speech in totality.
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:21.041]  And they know that.
[02:43:21.121 --> 02:43:22.981]  And that's why everything we do is symbiotic.
[02:43:23.001 --> 02:43:28.204]  And that's why it's exciting to see people excited about the new products we have and things like Ultra 12.
[02:43:28.704 --> 02:43:30.725]  It's just a redesign of Secret 12.
[02:43:30.865 --> 02:43:32.686]  When you change a formula, you're supposed to change the name.
[02:43:32.786 --> 02:43:33.706]  So it's Ultra 12.
[02:43:34.347 --> 02:43:35.727]  Advanced V12.
[02:43:35.907 --> 02:43:36.608]  It's amazing.
[02:43:36.668 --> 02:43:37.068]  You take it.
[02:43:37.248 --> 02:43:39.550]  Under the tongue to get better absorption.
[02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:42.573]  Infowarslive.com takes you right to the supplement page.
[02:43:42.653 --> 02:43:43.154]  It's 50% off.
[02:43:43.274 --> 02:43:45.175]  You cannot beat this.
[02:43:45.275 --> 02:43:46.236]  Nothing like it.
[02:43:46.256 --> 02:43:48.679]  $24.95 for the best vitamin B12 out there.
[02:43:48.719 --> 02:43:50.981]  Now twice as strong and now it's half off.
[02:43:51.081 --> 02:43:53.443]  Again, no reviews yet because it's really Secret 12+.
[02:43:53.963 --> 02:43:54.564]  Just came out.
[02:43:54.664 --> 02:43:57.647]  Go look at Secret 12 and its reviews and get it.
[02:43:57.867 --> 02:44:01.788]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:44:02.028 --> 02:44:09.850]  I signed a multi-year contract to be able to get you this price, and we reformulated it with the highest quality methylcobalamin that there is.
[02:44:10.010 --> 02:44:12.071]  You put it under your tongue, that's how you're able to absorb more of it.
[02:44:12.091 --> 02:44:15.111]  If you want, just gulp it down, but you only get a few percentage points that way.
[02:44:15.131 --> 02:44:16.272]  It's gotta be under the tongue.
[02:44:17.012 --> 02:44:17.972]  Second best way to have it.
[02:44:17.992 --> 02:44:18.872]  The other way is injectable.
[02:44:19.172 --> 02:44:20.833]  Gotta get that from a doctor, but it's the same stuff.
[02:44:20.853 --> 02:44:21.973]  Medical-grade methylcobalamin.
[02:44:22.193 --> 02:44:26.637]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, 50% out of the gates.
[02:44:26.657 --> 02:44:30.940]  Now, Secret 12 sold out, so this is now known as Ultra 12, because I'm not going to just call it Secret 12+.
[02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:31.981]  People don't get it.
[02:44:32.021 --> 02:44:36.645]  It's twice as much methylcobalamin, it's twice as strong for the same price, and we're doing it 50% off.
[02:44:36.665 --> 02:44:40.488]  You're getting very close to our cost at that, because I want you to see how amazing it is.
[02:44:40.568 --> 02:44:42.730]  You saw the thousands of five-star reviews for Secret 12.
[02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:45.392]  This is Secret 12, just twice as strong.
[02:44:45.592 --> 02:44:46.093]  Ultra 12.
[02:44:46.813 --> 02:44:47.314]  Ultra 12.
[02:44:48.034 --> 02:44:49.035]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:44:49.215 --> 02:44:50.056]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:44:50.076 --> 02:44:50.856]  You want real energy?
[02:44:50.976 --> 02:44:51.757]  You want real focus?
[02:44:51.997 --> 02:44:54.679]  So I started taking Iodine and Secret 12 five, six years ago.
[02:44:54.879 --> 02:44:56.000]  Dr. Group said this would happen.
[02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:59.323]  I had sunspots because I like the sun, I like to fish, I like to get outdoors.
[02:44:59.343 --> 02:45:04.206]  95% of the sunspots went away when I went on true vitamin B12, Methylcobalamin.
[02:45:04.346 --> 02:45:06.368]  That's why you got to remember to take your Methylcobalamin.
[02:45:06.488 --> 02:45:09.750]  InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:09.850 --> 02:45:12.332]  God gave us things like Methylcobalamin, the highest quality B12.
[02:45:13.576 --> 02:45:17.198]  And it's only in mushrooms, and it's only in, like, whale fat in high levels.
[02:45:17.679 --> 02:45:19.900]  And most people can't absorb it, especially northern Europeans.
[02:45:20.841 --> 02:45:23.903]  But if you take our new product, Better Than Secret 12, it's the same thing.
[02:45:23.943 --> 02:45:25.324]  Methylcobalamin, twice as strong.
[02:45:25.604 --> 02:45:26.905]  I signed a multi-year contract.
[02:45:27.145 --> 02:45:28.026]  Got a great deal on it.
[02:45:28.086 --> 02:45:28.406]  It's now.
[02:45:28.846 --> 02:45:31.849]  Twice as strong, the strongest B12 we even know of out there.
[02:45:31.929 --> 02:45:32.971]  Pure highest quality.
[02:45:33.091 --> 02:45:34.312]  Mythical Bottleman is the best.
[02:45:34.332 --> 02:45:36.314]  It's not just highest quality B12 of some type.
[02:45:36.414 --> 02:45:37.656]  It's the best of that type.
[02:45:37.776 --> 02:45:38.256]  Of the best.
[02:45:38.356 --> 02:45:40.639]  When the caffeine don't work no more, that just stimulates the brain.
[02:45:40.699 --> 02:45:43.001]  This is what empowers the whole body in a healthy way.
[02:45:43.182 --> 02:45:44.763]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:45:44.883 --> 02:45:45.784]  InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:46.305 --> 02:45:47.565]  Everything we do is a win-win.
[02:45:47.625 --> 02:45:48.706]  Everything we do is a 360 win.
[02:45:48.746 --> 02:45:49.886]  Everything we do is symbiotic.
[02:45:49.946 --> 02:45:52.006]  Everything we do is positive towards life.
[02:45:52.286 --> 02:45:56.187]  Just like we sell water filters you need that are the best rated out there at the lowest price.
[02:45:56.688 --> 02:45:59.348]  You fund the info to help others while you get something helps you.
[02:45:59.728 --> 02:46:00.889]  That's God's plan.
[02:46:00.909 --> 02:46:01.369]  Stay with us.
[02:46:03.989 --> 02:46:10.491]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[02:46:11.397 --> 02:46:15.167]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[02:46:15.669 --> 02:46:19.399]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[02:46:25.049 --> 02:46:26.710]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:46:26.750 --> 02:46:27.711]  This is racketeering.
[02:46:27.971 --> 02:46:28.792]  This is cartels.
[02:46:29.092 --> 02:46:31.154]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:46:31.514 --> 02:46:32.835]  We need it now.
[02:46:33.375 --> 02:46:34.656]  You can take on Big Tech.
[02:46:35.076 --> 02:46:43.503]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[02:46:44.023 --> 02:46:51.829]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, OK, take him off the air, everyone else, like Domino's, would fall.
[02:46:52.069 --> 02:46:52.930]  The way to fight back
[02:46:53.510 --> 02:46:55.012]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:35.140 --> 02:47:36.321]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:36.361 --> 02:47:37.962]  Alex Jones here live with Gavin McGinnis.
[02:47:38.702 --> 02:47:40.083]  I'm taking your phone calls right now.
[02:47:40.783 --> 02:47:44.385]  Coming up, Matt Bracken's hosting the fourth hour ahead of the War Room.
[02:47:45.326 --> 02:47:46.386]  But I'm looking at these headlines.
[02:47:47.527 --> 02:47:49.788]  We're not whining about the censorship of ourselves.
[02:47:49.888 --> 02:47:51.209]  It's how draconian it is.
[02:47:51.829 --> 02:47:53.790]  How then these big tech companies lie to Congress.
[02:47:54.811 --> 02:47:55.751]  This happened a few days ago.
[02:47:55.891 --> 02:48:01.875]  Facebook censors Michelle Malkin for a post about Laura Loomer and Gavin McGinnis.
[02:48:03.456 --> 02:48:04.036]  And myself.
[02:48:04.056 --> 02:48:07.800]  She just linked to an article and said, it's wrong to censor these people.
[02:48:08.280 --> 02:48:09.121]  This is dangerous.
[02:48:09.181 --> 02:48:11.483]  So they shut her account down.
[02:48:12.524 --> 02:48:14.045]  So again, we're going to silence people.
[02:48:14.546 --> 02:48:16.248]  And if you don't like it, you're silenced.
[02:48:16.988 --> 02:48:18.249]  Oh, but we're not censoring.
[02:48:18.930 --> 02:48:22.634]  They tell Congress, you know, I just saw Trump during the break.
[02:48:23.154 --> 02:48:24.716]  He's live at a press conference.
[02:48:25.076 --> 02:48:27.658]  The Democrats are already bitching that he wants to deport MS-13.
[02:48:29.810 --> 02:48:31.851]  As Pelosi said, all God's children.
[02:48:32.892 --> 02:48:34.192]  So Gavin, I mean, there's no mistake.
[02:48:34.232 --> 02:48:37.814]  The globalists and the forces that work with them are trying to conquer this country.
[02:48:37.854 --> 02:48:38.475]  It's very simple.
[02:48:40.696 --> 02:48:41.416]  Isn't it bizarre?
[02:48:41.456 --> 02:48:44.698]  I mean, we've talked about this before, but your company's called InfoWars.
[02:48:44.738 --> 02:48:50.581]  And I saw Stephen Colbert joking around going, looks like Alex Jones lost his war on info.
[02:48:51.342 --> 02:48:52.002]  And you go, yeah.
[02:48:52.563 --> 02:48:53.704]  That's exactly what happened.
[02:48:53.724 --> 02:48:54.685]  That's not a joke.
[02:48:55.265 --> 02:48:59.028]  And I think this sort of boomer left.
[02:48:59.409 --> 02:49:03.372]  All of these people, by the way, that we're having trouble with are rich white people.
[02:49:03.492 --> 02:49:06.874]  And it's under the auspices of fighting for equality.
[02:49:07.275 --> 02:49:09.797]  But don't these dummies realize they're making us cool?
[02:49:10.495 --> 02:49:12.917]  That's why I wore this motorcycle jacket.
[02:49:13.377 --> 02:49:18.000]  They are, Gen Y, Gen Z, these younger people, they're going, oh, they're verboten.
[02:49:18.100 --> 02:49:22.322]  You mean like rock and roll in the 50s where they would burn records because it was Satan's music?
[02:49:22.703 --> 02:49:33.129]  They're making us fun and exciting and they are showing themselves to be weak and incapable of debate and incapable of handling differing opinions.
[02:49:33.529 --> 02:49:39.593]  They're making themselves look really bad and they're making us look really cool and good, especially to young people.
[02:49:41.132 --> 02:49:44.774]  But their arrogance is, well, we'll just censor them too, and we'll tell people not to promote it.
[02:49:44.874 --> 02:49:47.375]  And I don't see it lasting long term.
[02:49:47.395 --> 02:49:51.637]  You were on about three years ago, and I said, what is peak leftist arrangement?
[02:49:51.817 --> 02:49:54.238]  And you said, well, I don't think we've gotten anywhere close to it.
[02:49:54.838 --> 02:49:56.399]  Tomorrow, we're going to air a compilation.
[02:49:57.316 --> 02:50:10.969]  Um, not two years ago or three years ago, but the latest stuff in the last year of all the leftist attacks and insanity and when you go out in public, they're just all like crazed maniacs, these entitled zombies on methamphetamine.
[02:50:12.637 --> 02:50:14.038]  Where do you think you're going to go from here?
[02:50:14.118 --> 02:50:15.839]  Because I think Trump's going to win.
[02:50:15.859 --> 02:50:18.040]  I think globalism is going to continue to decline.
[02:50:18.060 --> 02:50:21.102]  There's all these international reports that the EU is about to collapse.
[02:50:21.542 --> 02:50:23.103]  The Chi-Com economy is falling apart.
[02:50:23.123 --> 02:50:27.766]  You know, Trump does have grand juries criminally investigating the Democrats.
[02:50:27.786 --> 02:50:30.528]  I mean, what are they going to do as things just get worse and worse for them?
[02:50:32.176 --> 02:50:35.497]  They're going to get more violent, and they're going to get more destructive.
[02:50:35.817 --> 02:50:38.819]  But what you're going to see after Trump wins is two Americas.
[02:50:39.239 --> 02:50:56.606]  There's going to be reality where the economy is booming, where China's got slapped in the wrist and then understands they can't mess with us anymore, where immigration is getting curbed, where I hope a wall is starting, but at the very least we will not have the open borders we've been dealing with since George W. Bush.
[02:50:57.587 --> 02:50:59.948]  And that will be what's actually going on.
[02:51:00.448 --> 02:51:19.352]  Then, there'll be almost half the country that will be in clown world, where in their minds, in their day-to-day behavior, the most extreme, far-right, Richard Spencer, David Duke, Andrew Anglin, Daily Stormer, all of these far, far-right guys that make up a tiny sliver of the right.
[02:51:19.512 --> 02:51:20.812]  A tiny, tiny sliver.
[02:51:21.372 --> 02:51:24.434]  In their minds, that will just be like 60% of the country.
[02:51:24.794 --> 02:51:38.481]  So they will be walking around in basically a movie, a crazy movie that doesn't exist, where America is a Nazi hellhole of bigotry and hatred, and they'll live their lives accordingly.
[02:51:39.261 --> 02:51:47.946]  We're about to see an almost like North Korean dystopia, where reality and people's perception are not even in the same universe.
[02:51:48.746 --> 02:51:49.827]  And that's the thing we see.
[02:51:50.027 --> 02:51:52.169]  Every blue city is going bankrupt and collapsing.
[02:51:52.689 --> 02:51:56.152]  Every blue city is ratcheting up taxes.
[02:51:56.713 --> 02:51:58.835]  Every blue city is doubling down on everything.
[02:51:59.115 --> 02:52:08.883]  And everyone's fleeing them as they just delusionally stomp around like all of America is some SJW university just howling at the moon about Nazis.
[02:52:08.923 --> 02:52:09.464]  It's insane.
[02:52:11.115 --> 02:52:12.576]  And it could lead to a civil war.
[02:52:12.756 --> 02:52:14.457]  Clown world versus the real world.
[02:52:14.917 --> 02:52:16.898]  And the irony is, both agree.
[02:52:16.938 --> 02:52:22.982]  Like, when Proud Boys are fighting these anti-fascists, they're saying, yeah, dummy, we hate fascism too.
[02:52:23.342 --> 02:52:24.362]  Everyone does.
[02:52:24.983 --> 02:52:27.004]  Trump is not Hitler, dumbass.
[02:52:27.284 --> 02:52:28.545]  We both hate tyranny.
[02:52:28.845 --> 02:52:31.927]  We're both... But see, Gavin, they don't hate tyranny.
[02:52:32.127 --> 02:52:35.649]  They're the tyrants that project their authoritarianism onto us.
[02:52:37.369 --> 02:52:39.551]  Yeah, they don't like certain types of tyranny.
[02:52:40.111 --> 02:52:42.453]  It's like tyranny for me, but not for thee.
[02:52:43.254 --> 02:52:47.317]  And the irony is, in our version of events, everyone's freer.
[02:52:47.337 --> 02:52:48.238]  There's more freedom.
[02:52:48.298 --> 02:52:49.459]  There's more anarchy.
[02:52:49.720 --> 02:52:50.720]  There's less government.
[02:52:50.981 --> 02:52:54.303]  Trump is the most punk rock anarchist president we've ever had.
[02:52:54.824 --> 02:52:56.205]  Reagan was a punk rocker.
[02:52:56.545 --> 02:52:58.107]  Margaret Thatcher was a punk rocker.
[02:52:58.147 --> 02:52:59.908]  They all wanted to destroy the government.
[02:53:00.108 --> 02:53:01.950]  They all hated the government.
[02:53:02.390 --> 02:53:11.852]  And then you get these big government anarchists, whatever the hell that means, who can't wait for more regulations and more rules and more discipline and less freedom.
[02:53:11.872 --> 02:53:24.495]  I mean, you just got to sort of just shake your head and keep fighting because we're dealing with the good times has created some weak men and we are dealing with the pussification of America.
[02:53:25.748 --> 02:53:29.654]  Well, men now think running up a white flag and groveling is a cool thing to do.
[02:53:30.115 --> 02:53:31.237]  It's a bunch of conformity.
[02:53:31.297 --> 02:53:33.961]  It's very, very bizarre.
[02:53:34.061 --> 02:53:35.283]  Alex, Mark Ruffalo.
[02:53:36.004 --> 02:53:37.687]  You know Mark Ruffalo, the guy that plays the Hulk?
[02:53:38.718 --> 02:53:44.460]  I saw a tweet he put up right before Ilhan Omar was elected and Alexandria Cortez was elected.
[02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:52.042]  He was literally holding a white handkerchief like this in the tweet and he was saying, goodbye patriarchy!
[02:53:52.422 --> 02:53:53.322]  See ya!
[02:53:53.762 --> 02:53:56.763]  This is a man who is a patriarch by the way.
[02:53:56.823 --> 02:54:03.045]  He has kids and he's sitting there holding a literal white flag waving goodbye to the patriarchy.
[02:54:03.505 --> 02:54:05.225]  That's our Incredible Hulk today.
[02:54:05.385 --> 02:54:05.726]  Great.
[02:54:06.186 --> 02:54:07.106]  Great work America.
[02:54:07.984 --> 02:54:11.146]  Well, I mean, clearly all of this is to demoralize the human family.
[02:54:11.806 --> 02:54:17.689]  Notice that China won't allow any Hollywood propaganda into China, but they're financing most of it here.
[02:54:18.370 --> 02:54:32.337]  It's just so bizarre to see this kind of follower class, all acting like street gang thugs, trying to make us conform to what they're wanting to build and wanting us to conform to their delusions.
[02:54:32.417 --> 02:54:34.038]  It's just, it's like mass psychosis.
[02:54:35.745 --> 02:54:49.415]  Well, what do you do when you're a spoiled brat and you have no culture and you feel like you're lacking discipline, you feel like a spoiled brat, and you look at your baby boomer dad who, though he's rich now, he grew up kind of poor, and you think, I have no substance.
[02:54:49.775 --> 02:54:53.898]  I see the Freedom Riders riding in the South in the 60s fighting for justice.
[02:54:54.178 --> 02:54:55.559]  I wish I had something like that.
[02:54:55.999 --> 02:54:58.080]  I know, I'm just going to take it all out on daddy.
[02:54:58.540 --> 02:55:02.601]  So, so much of this stupid leftist culture is daddy issues.
[02:55:03.021 --> 02:55:05.502]  Let's make Homer Simpson a bumbling buffoon.
[02:55:05.782 --> 02:55:08.903]  Let's talk about white males on the money, the dead presidents.
[02:55:09.143 --> 02:55:12.224]  Let's talk about how much we hate dads, basically.
[02:55:12.264 --> 02:55:14.604]  Smash the patriarchy means I hate you, daddy.
[02:55:14.844 --> 02:55:23.367]  And it's basically a kid running up to his room and saying, I hate it here, and slamming the door so hard that his little name tag that's on the front falls off onto the
[02:55:24.648 --> 02:55:28.514]  And then if he's really a spoiled rotten lunatic, he'll like poop in his bed or something.
[02:55:28.854 --> 02:55:37.907]  Which every city run by leftists, even homeless, I'm sure you've seen it in the news, they call it the Portland Poopers, the men go out and poop to show how powerful they are.
[02:55:38.208 --> 02:55:39.490]  So everyone's just crapping everywhere.
[02:55:41.335 --> 02:55:42.316]  Lord of the Flies.
[02:55:42.756 --> 02:55:45.157]  And San Francisco is the beginning.
[02:55:45.237 --> 02:55:48.138]  I mean, we need to see the future ahead of us.
[02:55:48.238 --> 02:55:55.781]  Ezra Levant was describing London as a dystopian time machine, where you can see where we're going to be in about five years.
[02:55:55.921 --> 02:55:57.502]  And I think that's a very accurate assumption.
[02:55:57.522 --> 02:55:59.183]  And you can even see it within America.
[02:55:59.203 --> 02:56:02.704]  These Dem run cities, they're all going to be like San Francisco soon.
[02:56:02.764 --> 02:56:07.266]  New York is minutes away from being California.
[02:56:07.506 --> 02:56:08.667]  We're going to see it everywhere.
[02:56:09.087 --> 02:56:09.627]  Detroit,
[02:56:12.427 --> 02:56:13.188]  East New York.
[02:56:15.331 --> 02:56:15.931]  What's it called?
[02:56:16.092 --> 02:56:16.792]  The B-Town?
[02:56:17.153 --> 02:56:17.653]  Burlington?
[02:56:17.713 --> 02:56:19.035]  No, Baltimore!
[02:56:19.594 --> 02:56:24.298]  Baltimore, they're all going to be the same soon and it's going to be the reign of the homeless.
[02:56:24.758 --> 02:56:30.063]  By the way, I'm a little scared of how I talked about Portland Poopers and they pulled it up within three seconds.
[02:56:30.763 --> 02:56:32.765]  Were you guys like already on Portland Pooper?
[02:56:32.785 --> 02:56:36.288]  I haven't talked about that in like a month and just like instantly I said Portland Pooper.
[02:56:36.328 --> 02:56:38.029]  It was like on screen for TV viewers.
[02:56:38.049 --> 02:56:38.329]  Look at him.
[02:56:38.690 --> 02:56:39.470]  But this is a phenomenon.
[02:56:39.490 --> 02:56:42.193]  These men like it's their sacrament to do something bad.
[02:56:42.893 --> 02:56:46.155]  And it's like, oh, I'm a bad, I'm a naughty, I pooped on the street corner.
[02:56:46.175 --> 02:56:49.138]  And they have liberal women, like, I like it, I like men pooping.
[02:56:49.498 --> 02:56:50.999]  It's fun, it's liberal.
[02:56:51.019 --> 02:56:53.041]  Oh my God, it's so sexy!
[02:56:53.421 --> 02:56:54.382]  Poop on me!
[02:56:54.402 --> 02:56:57.624]  Wow, Gab McGinnis, the verboten film.
[02:56:57.684 --> 02:56:58.605]  You can't watch this.
[02:56:59.045 --> 02:56:59.665]  It's the name of the film.
[02:57:00.646 --> 02:57:03.128]  YouCantWatchThis.com is where you go.
[02:57:03.228 --> 02:57:04.829]  CensoredMovie.com will take you there as well.
[02:57:04.889 --> 02:57:05.270]  You're in it.
[02:57:05.390 --> 02:57:05.630]  I'm in it.
[02:57:05.650 --> 02:57:06.270]  It's powerful.
[02:57:06.551 --> 02:57:07.631]  It's an important message.
[02:57:07.671 --> 02:57:08.832]  I hope everybody downloads it.
[02:57:08.852 --> 02:57:11.895]  I hope everybody buys the film because that supports these filmmakers.
[02:57:12.375 --> 02:57:13.276]  It's very, very important.
[02:57:13.576 --> 02:57:15.157]  Gavin, thanks for spending time with us.
[02:57:15.938 --> 02:57:17.659]  You're still on YouTube for now.
[02:57:17.699 --> 02:57:19.681]  You still have popular stuff you're doing in a lot of places.
[02:57:20.121 --> 02:57:21.042]  You're working with The Rebel.
[02:57:21.082 --> 02:57:23.303]  I know your brother has a show there now.
[02:57:23.744 --> 02:57:24.604]  Tongue-in-cheek, that's you.
[02:57:24.965 --> 02:57:26.366]  Where's the best place for people to find you?
[02:57:26.426 --> 02:57:27.647]  Is that DefendGavin.com?
[02:57:29.338 --> 02:57:38.021]  Yeah, DefendGavin.com, NoHate.com is my brother's site, and my YouTube page is TheGavin2000 or Gavin McInnes, we'll take you there.
[02:57:38.341 --> 02:57:40.942]  I'll definitely be banned from YouTube.
[02:57:41.002 --> 02:57:43.643]  Hold on, hold on, I forgot the main reason I got you on.
[02:57:43.663 --> 02:57:44.743]  We're going to break for two minutes.
[02:57:45.003 --> 02:57:45.863]  Come back in a few minutes.
[02:57:46.163 --> 02:57:51.105]  I gotta ask you, how your lawsuit against the SPLC and all the firings we're seeing there.
[02:57:52.346 --> 02:57:58.556]  Eisenhower said beware the military-industrial complex, and I would say that that needs to be updated to beware of what I call TIM.
[02:57:59.097 --> 02:58:01.000]  Technology, intelligence, and media.
[02:59:32.841 --> 02:59:37.202]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.070 --> 03:00:05.617]  Son of a bitch!
[03:00:25.968 --> 03:00:26.729]  Welcome back, folks.
[03:00:26.769 --> 03:00:28.612]  Gavin McGinnis is leaving us here in about four minutes.
[03:00:29.213 --> 03:00:31.296]  I'm gonna come back, take your calls, and Matt Bracken's coming up.
[03:00:31.736 --> 03:00:32.537]  I promise to get your calls.
[03:00:32.557 --> 03:00:34.079]  We're gonna do our best here, so I want to talk to you.
[03:00:35.021 --> 03:00:39.827]  But Gavin, I don't want people to think I'm a loser or I'm a victim.
[03:00:39.947 --> 03:00:42.150]  I've been attacked, you've been attacked, because we've been effective.
[03:00:42.651 --> 03:00:54.121]  Relaunching common sense and success and standing up to a bunch of authoritarian losers and control freaks that are just comically ridiculous and have used our open and free society to convert it to a tyranny almost overnight.
[03:00:54.181 --> 03:01:05.371]  The backlash, the pendulum is swinging back, but I'm quite frankly proud of the fact, I mean it's not fun, but like you said you're wearing a Rebel Without a Cause
[03:01:06.897 --> 03:01:08.219]  Jacket that you pull off quite well.
[03:01:08.239 --> 03:01:12.284]  I just look like a black apple or something about World War One, but like a black balloon.
[03:01:14.930 --> 03:01:20.793]  And it is kind of fun to be rock and roll, but this isn't like rock and roll where they were trying to act cool or break into a guitar.
[03:01:21.313 --> 03:01:25.115]  This isn't like outlaw country where they talk about smoking weed and having sex with women.
[03:01:25.556 --> 03:01:28.777]  Which is fine, Waylon Jennings, all those guys love them.
[03:01:28.917 --> 03:01:31.699]  There's not been something this rock and roll ever.
[03:01:31.739 --> 03:01:34.140]  This is more rock and roll than rock and roll.
[03:01:34.500 --> 03:01:37.782]  And then you file suit, a bunch of other suits are getting filed, we're developing one.
[03:01:38.482 --> 03:01:46.604]  It's the Southern Primary Law Center, this terrorist organization that goes around doing this, and suddenly they're head guy, they're deputy, they're all quitting, there's lawsuits starting internally.
[03:01:47.144 --> 03:01:48.904]  I mean, this is spectacular.
[03:01:48.964 --> 03:01:51.025]  So, we're not rock and roll.
[03:01:51.045 --> 03:01:56.726]  We're not the new punk rock, because we're way more radical and real and Americana than that.
[03:01:56.746 --> 03:01:59.287]  So what would you... I mean, we're not bragging, but it's just... Sorry.
[03:01:59.667 --> 03:02:05.128]  We're way more radical and cutting edge and more persecuted than the Sex Pistols and, you know, people like...
[03:02:07.023 --> 03:02:07.684]  Elvis or whatever.
[03:02:07.704 --> 03:02:08.364]  What would you call it?
[03:02:09.605 --> 03:02:10.526]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[03:02:10.586 --> 03:02:11.967]  I mean, that was fashion.
[03:02:12.307 --> 03:02:14.869]  And by the way, a lot of this is fashion back and forth.
[03:02:14.909 --> 03:02:16.109]  These people don't care about the truth.
[03:02:16.170 --> 03:02:19.012]  It's like I always compare it to the Mons and the Rockers fighting on Brighton Beach.
[03:02:19.052 --> 03:02:21.573]  But they're fighting for some sort of silly gain.
[03:02:21.593 --> 03:02:22.034]  They don't care.
[03:02:22.054 --> 03:02:23.675]  Like, they call Trump an anti-Semite.
[03:02:23.915 --> 03:02:26.597]  He's the most pro-Jewish president imaginable.
[03:02:27.225 --> 03:02:31.287]  Yeah, so they're not concerned about the facts, but they just want to win.
[03:02:31.427 --> 03:02:38.411]  And you're right, we are fighting not for some sort of petty win, we're fighting for the very fabric of this country.
[03:02:38.431 --> 03:02:47.977]  This country is incredibly unique, it's built on grit, it's built on mobility, it's built on meritocracy, it's built on individualism, it's built on nationalism, it's built on Christianity.
[03:02:48.437 --> 03:02:53.081]  And it's built on this concept of let's give people freedom because we trust them.
[03:02:53.181 --> 03:02:56.164]  Come on over here, bust your ass, and you can be rich too.
[03:02:56.204 --> 03:02:57.365]  Let's all climb aboard.
[03:02:57.885 --> 03:02:59.326]  And they are tearing away at that.
[03:02:59.346 --> 03:03:00.307]  They're pushing us left.
[03:03:00.327 --> 03:03:03.890]  They're trying to make us into Europe, into the Soviet Union.
[03:03:04.110 --> 03:03:06.993]  They're trying to socialize us as socialists.
[03:03:07.378 --> 03:03:13.246]  And you just said it, they're trying to break our will, we're fighting not just for the American way, we're fighting for our literal lives.
[03:03:13.607 --> 03:03:22.339]  We are being conquered by a bunch of control freaks and we must rise to the occasion and you've done it with your lawsuit against SPLC.
[03:03:22.379 --> 03:03:22.900]  Tell us about that.
[03:03:24.366 --> 03:03:28.868]  Yeah, so the reason I fought the SPLC too is because they've infiltrated my Wikipedia.
[03:03:28.948 --> 03:03:31.870]  My Wikipedia doesn't sound like anyone I've even heard of before.
[03:03:32.270 --> 03:03:34.912]  They ruined the Proud Boys, got dozens of them fired.
[03:03:35.312 --> 03:03:41.335]  Every time you see an article talking about this hate figure crap, it's eventually linked back to the SPLC's false allegations.
[03:03:41.695 --> 03:03:42.816]  And I thought, I've had enough.
[03:03:42.996 --> 03:03:49.399]  And the reason it's really important to fight these things is because you have to show the world what the truth is.
[03:03:50.880 --> 03:03:52.561]  You can't bow down and get walked all over.
[03:03:53.161 --> 03:03:55.122]  Like, Jared from Subway, remember him?
[03:03:55.682 --> 03:04:00.243]  So he took a plea deal because they were calling him a pedophile, and I think he got 15 years in jail.
[03:04:00.563 --> 03:04:06.065]  When you hear that, you go, holy crap, he must have been a real serious pedophile if he's taking a deal.
[03:04:06.665 --> 03:04:07.626]  I'm not taking a deal.
[03:04:07.886 --> 03:04:10.046]  I'm not guilty of the things they're saying.
[03:04:10.306 --> 03:04:13.507]  The Proud Boys, the three remaining ones, they're not taking a deal.
[03:04:13.587 --> 03:04:22.070]  And in the one minute you have left, as soon as you filed that suit, all the resignations, all the firings, it was like magic that you started imploding.
[03:04:23.869 --> 03:04:27.290]  Morris Dees was fired for sexism and racism.
[03:04:28.390 --> 03:04:34.171]  Richard Cohen, the president, after laughing at me and saying this suit is frivolous, he was then forced to step down.
[03:04:34.451 --> 03:04:41.812]  Their head of legal, I assume realizing there's going to be discovery and we're going to see all the malicious behavior they're up to, she steps down.
[03:04:41.872 --> 03:04:42.553]  They are crumbling.
[03:04:42.733 --> 03:04:46.153]  The ACLU jumped in and tried to help them to dismiss this.
[03:04:46.453 --> 03:04:49.794]  The judge just told them, no, ACLU, you're not getting involved here.
[03:04:50.114 --> 03:04:54.516]  We just recently, a couple days ago, put in our motion to dismiss, their motion to dismiss.
[03:04:54.897 --> 03:04:59.239]  I mean, we haven't even stepped in the ring, and they're already dropping like flies.
[03:04:59.299 --> 03:04:59.839]  Incredible.
[03:04:59.999 --> 03:05:00.460]  Incredible.
[03:05:00.480 --> 03:05:00.860]  Great job.
[03:05:00.880 --> 03:05:01.640]  We'll talk to you soon.
[03:05:02.080 --> 03:05:02.421]  Thank you.
[03:05:06.023 --> 03:05:15.848]  This is next level, breaking ground, history book level, science fiction dystopia, tyranny on steroids.
[03:05:20.904 --> 03:05:35.234]  Just take the red pill, people!
[03:05:54.415 --> 03:05:56.396]  If you leave me
[03:06:26.417 --> 03:06:39.729]  All right, I keep trying to go to your calls, and we got Matt Braggin coming up, so I'm pushing him back.
[03:06:52.398 --> 03:06:55.699]  And you got Trump just unveiled a merit-based immigration system.
[03:06:56.539 --> 03:06:59.279]  And I was sitting in there trying to eat my lunch in four minutes watching him.
[03:06:59.960 --> 03:07:00.900]  And I said, let me guess.
[03:07:00.920 --> 03:07:03.000]  This has been going on 30 minutes.
[03:07:03.020 --> 03:07:04.120]  He's released the text of it.
[03:07:05.481 --> 03:07:09.682]  I bet the Democrats are already decrying deporting convicted criminals like MS-13.
[03:07:10.222 --> 03:07:13.682]  And sure as hell, it was already in the Washington Post.
[03:07:14.363 --> 03:07:15.503]  These people are predictable.
[03:07:15.563 --> 03:07:19.084]  I mean, Trump could have a cure for cancer, and they would say they didn't want it.
[03:07:19.404 --> 03:07:20.664]  It's just crazy.
[03:07:22.270 --> 03:07:26.412]  Speaking of that, there's an article on Infowars.com that is incredible.
[03:07:26.432 --> 03:07:28.493]  It's a zero-hedge article.
[03:07:29.594 --> 03:07:34.376]  And I knew this about Brennan, former head of national security.
[03:07:35.697 --> 03:07:37.098]  I didn't know it about Comey.
[03:07:37.658 --> 03:07:39.019]  But sure enough, they've got links to it.
[03:07:39.599 --> 03:07:41.600]  They both voted communist.
[03:07:47.023 --> 03:07:47.363]  Into the 1980s.
[03:07:47.483 --> 03:07:48.143]  Is that not crazy?
[03:07:52.421 --> 03:08:01.467]  The heads of Obama's FBI and CIA both voted for Communists during the Cold War, yet were somehow able to move up the ranks within the same U.S.
[03:08:01.507 --> 03:08:05.009]  intelligence community that has spent decades fighting that very ideology.
[03:08:06.189 --> 03:08:11.893]  And then when I went and read this during the breaks, it's in mainstream news!
[03:08:11.933 --> 03:08:12.913]  They're both bragging!
[03:08:13.014 --> 03:08:14.675]  Comey's like, I'm a commie!
[03:08:15.695 --> 03:08:18.297]  He's like some 8-foot tall weird-ass Martian
[03:08:20.199 --> 03:08:25.642]  Who's obviously doesn't like, and you're a communist, the big banks want you controlled under communism.
[03:08:26.162 --> 03:08:27.123]  They're all exempt from it.
[03:08:27.223 --> 03:08:27.523]  Wow.
[03:08:28.644 --> 03:08:31.966]  What a bunch of American hating trash.
[03:08:32.746 --> 03:08:35.108]  Boy, Joseph McCarthy sure got proven right, didn't he?
[03:08:37.809 --> 03:08:40.771]  He never did one-tenth of the persecution the left's doing of us right now.
[03:08:41.391 --> 03:08:43.432]  And notice, they're calling us Russian.
[03:08:45.774 --> 03:08:47.775]  Unbelievable.
[03:08:50.131 --> 03:08:51.492]  Absolutely insane.
[03:08:52.573 --> 03:08:54.855]  All right, we're gonna go ahead and go to some of your phone calls now.
[03:08:56.056 --> 03:08:58.638]  And then I will play some of that Trump speech, then Matt Bracken's gonna come on.
[03:08:59.979 --> 03:09:04.202]  So the first caller, we can put that call list back up on screen for me, thank you.
[03:09:04.962 --> 03:09:18.693]  First caller I wanna go to, and then we're gonna get to Lander and William and others, is Maryland Patriot says that his wife and mother are pushing him, I guess, to get vaccines.
[03:09:20.071 --> 03:09:24.213]  And so I'm going to find out what's happening or pushing for their child to have vaccines.
[03:09:24.613 --> 03:09:26.074]  So tell us what's happening, Maryland Patriot.
[03:09:28.775 --> 03:09:30.356]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[03:09:30.556 --> 03:09:31.696]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:09:31.716 --> 03:09:32.477]  Appreciate you, brother.
[03:09:33.737 --> 03:09:35.138]  I want to plug your products, man.
[03:09:35.238 --> 03:09:37.279]  I'm a 49-year-old landscaper.
[03:09:37.319 --> 03:09:48.904]  I do patios, walks, and walls, and I couldn't do what I do without DNA Force bringing the feeling back in my three fingers on my left hand, the bodies every day to calm my body.
[03:09:49.540 --> 03:09:50.940]  The super male vitality.
[03:09:52.021 --> 03:09:57.922]  If I had to pick one product to take, and it was the only one I could take with me on a ship or whatever, I would take the iodine.
[03:09:58.762 --> 03:10:03.643]  The silver bullet keeps me and my family from being really sick.
[03:10:04.143 --> 03:10:05.223]  It keeps us clean.
[03:10:05.383 --> 03:10:12.105]  And a load of other, I got your air filter, your water filter, and we're living good.
[03:10:13.045 --> 03:10:19.166]  I'm in a freaking war against my mother, my aunt, and my wife.
[03:10:19.833 --> 03:10:19.973]  Wow.
[03:10:19.993 --> 03:10:20.073]  Wow.
[03:10:35.518 --> 03:10:44.685]  Well, they get into hysteria, and it's peer pressure, and then they see all the stuff in the news, and so have you showed them that there's no safety testing on vaccines?
[03:10:45.086 --> 03:10:46.787]  Have you showed them they have liability protection?
[03:10:47.067 --> 03:11:04.982]  Have you read them the inserts of measles, mumps, and rubella, saying it can cause type 1 diabetes, or Guillain-Barre, or all sorts of autoimmune diseases, or that children for at least a year, especially if they're breastfed, have childhood immunity, infant immunity, and if you give them vaccines, it can cause a permanent autoimmune disorder.
[03:11:05.462 --> 03:11:09.103]  I mean, have you actually gone to Walgreens or CVS and said, I don't want your fact sheet.
[03:11:10.303 --> 03:11:13.424]  I want the insert by law you're supposed to give me that comes in each bottle of it.
[03:11:13.884 --> 03:11:14.844]  I mean, have you gotten that?
[03:11:15.144 --> 03:11:16.904]  And it's as thin as Bible paper.
[03:11:16.924 --> 03:11:17.685]  It is Bible paper.
[03:11:18.465 --> 03:11:20.465]  And you can sit there and highlight it with a magnifying glass.
[03:11:20.805 --> 03:11:22.026]  It's the finest print you've ever seen.
[03:11:22.046 --> 03:11:23.046]  Okay?
[03:11:23.126 --> 03:11:24.006]  It's like a pocket Bible.
[03:11:24.446 --> 03:11:25.846]  And then you show them that.
[03:11:25.866 --> 03:11:26.606]  I mean, have you done that?
[03:11:27.867 --> 03:11:28.807]  No, that's my next step.
[03:11:28.887 --> 03:11:30.047]  I have to do that.
[03:11:30.107 --> 03:11:31.107]  That's the ace of spades.
[03:11:31.147 --> 03:11:33.608]  That shuts people up real fast.
[03:11:34.701 --> 03:11:36.162]  You know, my wife's from Brazil, right?
[03:11:36.182 --> 03:11:37.903]  And we had my first son down there.
[03:11:38.563 --> 03:11:40.764]  And I fought her down there, but we were in Brazil.
[03:11:40.804 --> 03:11:42.745]  You know, there's a lot of third world stuff down there.
[03:11:42.806 --> 03:11:47.208]  And so I let her, you know, he got probably a dozen vaccines over two years.
[03:11:47.688 --> 03:11:49.169]  And, you know, thank God he's fine.
[03:11:49.189 --> 03:11:49.689]  He's bright.
[03:11:49.749 --> 03:11:50.330]  He's smart.
[03:11:50.410 --> 03:11:53.211]  But, you know, there's ticking time bombs in him.
[03:11:53.251 --> 03:11:53.932]  I realize that.
[03:11:54.452 --> 03:11:57.234]  Well, again, just, I mean, I can tell you how to argue this.
[03:11:58.014 --> 03:11:59.575]  I'd say, honey, honey.
[03:12:01.167 --> 03:12:03.151]  I know that you can learn immunity from vaccines.
[03:12:03.231 --> 03:12:05.214]  I know they can attenuate viruses and bacteria.
[03:12:06.502 --> 03:12:09.264]  But even Japan says, don't give kids vaccines until 18 months.
[03:12:09.644 --> 03:12:10.865]  They're more industrialized than us.
[03:12:11.425 --> 03:12:14.407]  India banned the Gardasil shot that killed so many young girls.
[03:12:14.887 --> 03:12:17.569]  And say, you know they want to put hundreds of things in kids' bodies.
[03:12:18.170 --> 03:12:22.352]  You know that whatever else is in the shot, your body then creates an autoimmune response to for life.
[03:12:22.873 --> 03:12:33.399]  And just give her stacks of mainstream articles about autism up, or autoimmune disorders being way up, or allergies being associated with vaccines.
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:35.301]  And just show them and say, well, OK, honey.
[03:12:36.361 --> 03:12:38.322]  50 years ago it was three vaccines they wanted to push.
[03:12:38.362 --> 03:12:38.643]  Now it's 56.
[03:12:40.104 --> 03:12:40.484]  Soon it'll be 200.
[03:12:40.524 --> 03:12:42.665]  Should we give the baby 200 shots?
[03:12:43.286 --> 03:12:45.087]  Don't you get it's a newborn baby?
[03:12:45.927 --> 03:12:47.568]  You know, a bee sting could kill the baby.
[03:12:47.828 --> 03:12:48.649]  Well, what is in this?
[03:12:48.709 --> 03:12:54.793]  I mean, women have got to understand, and men as well, autoimmune responses.
[03:12:55.693 --> 03:12:58.495]  How many people listening took a vaccine once and got real sick?
[03:12:58.875 --> 03:12:59.656]  Almost everybody.
[03:13:00.156 --> 03:13:01.317]  Everybody I know in the military.
[03:13:02.317 --> 03:13:02.858]  Tough guys.
[03:13:03.752 --> 03:13:04.793]  Have gotten really, really sick.
[03:13:05.213 --> 03:13:07.114]  You can also read The Vaccine Epidemic.
[03:13:08.495 --> 03:13:09.356]  Very powerful book.
[03:13:09.996 --> 03:13:11.837]  Available at infowarestore.com.
[03:13:12.017 --> 03:13:12.718]  100% reviews.
[03:13:13.418 --> 03:13:14.099]  And give that to her.
[03:13:14.119 --> 03:13:16.480]  It's written, you know, by scientists, by experts.
[03:13:16.941 --> 03:13:17.721]  And it lays it all out.
[03:13:17.761 --> 03:13:19.022]  And let me tell you, mark my words.
[03:13:20.563 --> 03:13:24.826]  Monsanto and Bayer, explain this to them, are both in vaccines, okay?
[03:13:24.966 --> 03:13:25.546]  Especially Bayer.
[03:13:26.247 --> 03:13:31.950]  Bayer knowingly gave millions of people HIV in a blood product that they knew had it in it.
[03:13:32.050 --> 03:13:32.691]  They just didn't care.
[03:13:33.635 --> 03:13:33.835]  Okay?
[03:13:33.855 --> 03:13:38.699]  And it's the same thing with Monsanto and all the stuff they're doing.
[03:13:38.719 --> 03:13:39.999]  They're about to get bankrupted.
[03:13:40.580 --> 03:13:43.882]  Vaccine makers have liability protection, total protection.
[03:13:44.122 --> 03:13:45.763]  You've got to explain that.
[03:13:46.024 --> 03:13:51.647]  Say, hey, why can't other consumer groups that are allowed to talk about other issues talk about vaccines?
[03:13:51.928 --> 03:13:53.529]  Because it's their Achilles heel.
[03:13:53.929 --> 03:13:59.313]  If you think Monsanto and Roundup's bad, baby, it's mama's milk compared to what's in these vaccines.
[03:14:00.431 --> 03:14:01.672]  Mm-hmm.
[03:14:01.692 --> 03:14:01.972]  Mm-hmm.
[03:14:01.992 --> 03:14:04.733]  So that's for your wife and mother-in-law.
[03:14:04.753 --> 03:14:09.295]  This will be like 10 minutes into the fourth hour.
[03:14:09.796 --> 03:14:12.537]  So three hours, 10 minutes into the archive.
[03:14:12.597 --> 03:14:13.657]  It'll go up in a few hours.
[03:14:14.118 --> 03:14:15.158]  TimFullWars.com.
[03:14:15.178 --> 03:14:16.579]  You can queue it right up for your wife.
[03:14:17.688 --> 03:14:18.208]  And you know what?
[03:14:18.268 --> 03:14:20.149]  I'll bet your wife for your child's future.
[03:14:20.810 --> 03:14:21.390]  One-way bet.
[03:14:22.110 --> 03:14:25.372]  If she can prove wrong what I said, $10,000 to her.
[03:14:26.053 --> 03:14:27.413]  It's a one-way bet.
[03:14:27.453 --> 03:14:28.194]  God is my witness.
[03:14:28.674 --> 03:14:29.714]  We'll fly your wife here.
[03:14:29.734 --> 03:14:33.016]  I'll pay her $10,000 on air.
[03:14:33.036 --> 03:14:33.016]  $10,000.
[03:14:33.757 --> 03:14:35.398]  If she can prove anything I just said is wrong.
[03:14:36.158 --> 03:14:37.118]  You can't do it, lady.
[03:14:38.179 --> 03:14:38.979]  I got four kids.
[03:14:38.999 --> 03:14:39.780]  They've never had a shot.
[03:14:41.488 --> 03:14:51.480]  In Germany and China, they produce clean vaccines that cost thousands of dollars a shot, because they go through with spectrometers, electron microscopes, and testers, and screen everything out.
[03:14:52.220 --> 03:14:54.723]  Because then, it actually has an effect.
[03:14:54.924 --> 03:14:59.269]  If you have anything else in it, your body creates an autoimmune response.
[03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.729]  Look up 1996.
[03:15:03.329 --> 03:15:18.452]  UN, African doctors, and Pakistani doctors and Indian doctors found they were adding a female hormone to the tetanus shot, giving it to women, and it was sterilizing them, and they were having miscarriages in the second trimester because it created an autoimmune response to that hormone.
[03:15:18.872 --> 03:15:20.533]  Ma'am, look up.
[03:15:21.893 --> 03:15:22.393]  SV40.
[03:15:22.853 --> 03:15:24.354]  You'll have Snopes.
[03:15:24.514 --> 03:15:30.235]  Oh look, Snopes says SV40 is a cancer virus, and the government admits to giving people cancer, but not everybody.
[03:15:31.266 --> 03:15:32.627]  Snope says the sky isn't blue.
[03:15:33.047 --> 03:15:33.487]  Look it up.
[03:15:36.088 --> 03:15:36.889]  God bless you, brother.
[03:15:36.949 --> 03:15:38.169]  I really appreciate your call.
[03:15:38.390 --> 03:15:38.970]  I appreciate it.
[03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.510]  Call me back.
[03:15:40.170 --> 03:15:44.373]  And like I said, get his name and number.
[03:15:44.393 --> 03:15:44.373]  $10,000.
[03:15:45.253 --> 03:15:45.613]  One way.
[03:15:45.673 --> 03:15:47.774]  She's not betting me.
[03:15:48.154 --> 03:15:51.596]  If she can prove any of that substantively, she gets $10,000.
[03:15:51.636 --> 03:15:54.898]  You can't do it, ma'am.
[03:15:55.458 --> 03:15:59.080]  I want you to do the research and find out that you need to protect your baby.
[03:16:02.170 --> 03:16:02.914]  Hunter's Angle!
[03:16:09.448 --> 03:16:17.975]  Okay, so, you know, I mean, I see it as a compliment that Howard Stern talks about me every week and does these big, expensive, fancy puppet shows and plugs Infowars.com.
[03:16:17.995 --> 03:16:21.457]  I mean, that guy has arguably one of the top radio shows in the country.
[03:16:21.478 --> 03:16:22.598]  He's been number one before.
[03:16:22.638 --> 03:16:23.079]  That's great.
[03:16:23.139 --> 03:16:26.802]  That's always a form of endearment, even if somebody's lying about you, that they're obsessed with you.
[03:16:26.822 --> 03:16:28.823]  But I want to really talk to Howard Stern about something.
[03:16:28.883 --> 03:16:30.345]  I'm going to tell you this right now, Howard.
[03:16:30.445 --> 03:16:31.926]  You just had a big cancer scare.
[03:16:32.066 --> 03:16:35.228]  And I had my genetics tested, like I said, five years ago.
[03:16:36.489 --> 03:16:40.472]  And they've been in for about a year, and my doctor called me and he said, you never came in for your consultation.
[03:16:40.512 --> 03:16:44.895]  You paid thousands for this big top medical scan of your DNA.
[03:16:45.095 --> 03:16:48.918]  We took all this blood, for all the blood work, and we had blood tests.
[03:16:48.958 --> 03:16:51.380]  This isn't like 23andMe or whatever, okay?
[03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:52.701]  This is like the real deal.
[03:16:52.901 --> 03:16:55.802]  And I get in there and they go, here's all your genes for this and that.
[03:16:56.023 --> 03:16:58.224]  As we thought, you're Northern European, mainly.
[03:16:58.324 --> 03:17:01.925]  Basically, they can see the genetics coming down into Germany and into England.
[03:17:01.985 --> 03:17:03.086]  It's hiking, mainly.
[03:17:03.286 --> 03:17:09.389]  And they said, you've got all your genes but one that's only halfway turned on to not absorb vitamin B12.
[03:17:09.509 --> 03:17:13.191]  And the doctor was explaining to me, medical doctors on four degrees, top clinic in Austin.
[03:17:13.331 --> 03:17:17.233]  He said, you've got to take injectable vitamin B12.
[03:17:17.813 --> 03:17:24.802]  The next best thing, Howard, is, this is a plug by the way, pure methylcobalamin, same medical grade, under the tongue, you can absorb a lot of it.
[03:17:24.943 --> 03:17:30.430]  Do you know that there's only one group that gets cancer more than northern Europeans from lack of B12 absorption?
[03:17:30.931 --> 03:17:34.135]  Turns out Jews have the same mutation as northern Europeans.
[03:17:34.315 --> 03:17:35.396]  Some Japanese have it too.
[03:17:35.456 --> 03:17:35.636]  Dude.
[03:17:35.656 --> 03:17:36.316]  Okay.
[03:17:36.336 --> 03:17:43.340]  So, you better get your genetics tested, and instead of making jokes about my supplements, don't get it from me, go get it from a medical doctor.
[03:17:43.520 --> 03:17:45.321]  In fact, somebody go to my office refrigerator.
[03:17:45.401 --> 03:17:46.742]  I'm gonna inject on air right now.
[03:17:46.882 --> 03:17:48.543]  Will somebody go to their office refrigerator?
[03:17:48.563 --> 03:17:49.663]  I need to do this twice a week.
[03:17:49.683 --> 03:17:50.424]  I haven't done it in about a week.
[03:17:51.104 --> 03:17:51.965]  I'm gonna have plenty of energy.
[03:17:52.005 --> 03:17:53.846]  And then people go, oh God, what do you inject in your veins?
[03:17:53.866 --> 03:17:56.968]  No, it goes to your fat, and then you get like 50-some percent absorbed.
[03:17:57.108 --> 03:17:57.969]  Under your tongue, 10%.
[03:17:58.369 --> 03:17:59.430]  You eat a pill, maybe 1%.
[03:17:59.670 --> 03:18:01.632]  Let's think, you don't absorb B12.
[03:18:01.652 --> 03:18:04.014]  You could eat a whole bushel of mushrooms.
[03:18:04.054 --> 03:18:06.455]  You could eat a seal steak full of B12.
[03:18:06.736 --> 03:18:07.496]  You're not getting it.
[03:18:07.736 --> 03:18:09.277]  You have to get it in your blood.
[03:18:09.297 --> 03:18:11.339]  So I'm just gonna take this as an opportunity for everybody.
[03:18:11.479 --> 03:18:12.140]  This is a win-win.
[03:18:12.200 --> 03:18:14.442]  Finder Operation, get Ultra 12.
[03:18:14.642 --> 03:18:15.703]  Get Ultra 12.
[03:18:15.924 --> 03:18:17.966]  Ultra 12 is the new secret 12.
[03:18:18.046 --> 03:18:18.807]  Double strong.
[03:18:18.927 --> 03:18:19.808]  Signed a year contract.
[03:18:19.848 --> 03:18:20.428]  Got a better deal.
[03:18:20.468 --> 03:18:21.470]  They have new formulation.
[03:18:21.810 --> 03:18:27.336]  From what we've researched, this is the strongest, purest methacobalamin, which is the high end, at 50% off.
[03:18:27.436 --> 03:18:28.437]  Howard Stern.
[03:18:28.557 --> 03:18:29.798]  Try Ultra 12.
[03:18:29.979 --> 03:18:30.940]  See what it does.
[03:18:31.160 --> 03:18:32.001]  It's not a joke.
[03:18:32.081 --> 03:18:33.182]  But let me tell you, you could be black.
[03:18:33.342 --> 03:18:34.163]  You could be Hispanic.
[03:18:34.243 --> 03:18:35.684]  Most people don't absorb B12 either.
[03:18:35.724 --> 03:18:37.565]  B12 is that missing link.
[03:18:37.665 --> 03:18:42.748]  But if you're Northern European, it's a death sentence because you do not absorb it in your body.
[03:18:42.929 --> 03:18:44.530]  And your body, you will die.
[03:18:44.670 --> 03:18:47.111]  You die in four or five days without water.
[03:18:47.271 --> 03:18:49.253]  You die in about three weeks without food.
[03:18:49.333 --> 03:18:51.134]  You die in four minutes without oxygen.
[03:18:51.154 --> 03:18:53.776]  You die in six months without vitamin C. It's curvy.
[03:18:53.856 --> 03:18:54.877]  So, I want to explain something.
[03:18:54.897 --> 03:18:56.338]  I give my children Ultra-12.
[03:18:56.418 --> 03:18:57.859]  Here's my needles from my medical doctor.
[03:18:58.459 --> 03:18:59.539]  I'll inject this right now, here on air.
[03:18:59.559 --> 03:19:03.420]  Let me tell you something, I could be totally exhausted and having to do some overnight radio show.
[03:19:03.540 --> 03:19:04.240]  I don't drink coffee.
[03:19:04.480 --> 03:19:04.940]  You know what I do?
[03:19:05.821 --> 03:19:12.202]  I take some military-grade iodine, X2, and I inject the 12, baby.
[03:19:12.222 --> 03:19:17.383]  And this is the exact same stuff that's in Ultra 12, but we're not licensed to sell as injectables, so do not inject it.
[03:19:17.403 --> 03:19:19.084]  Now, you see that right there?
[03:19:19.764 --> 03:19:20.084]  Boom!
[03:19:20.504 --> 03:19:20.784]  Right here.
[03:19:23.422 --> 03:19:24.803]  Clean, pure energy.
[03:19:25.763 --> 03:19:31.026]  Overriding my genetic mutation as a Northern European that my body does not absorb it except for the bloodstream.
[03:19:31.567 --> 03:19:32.607]  That's what we're talking about.
[03:19:32.807 --> 03:19:33.848]  It's not a joke, Stern.
[03:19:33.988 --> 03:19:36.529]  So, if you want to live, Stern, do some damn research.
[03:19:36.549 --> 03:19:38.530]  Take medical-grade iodine and take B12.
[03:19:38.570 --> 03:19:39.191]  Zoom in on this.
[03:19:39.211 --> 03:19:39.951]  This is not what we sell.
[03:19:39.971 --> 03:19:40.712]  This is methyl B12.
[03:19:40.732 --> 03:19:42.333]  That just means altered B12.
[03:19:42.473 --> 03:19:43.773]  Methylcobalamin, the highest quality.
[03:19:43.893 --> 03:19:44.654]  And that's it right there.
[03:19:44.714 --> 03:19:45.354]  That's what I take.
[03:19:45.534 --> 03:19:46.315]  Been a week since I took it.
[03:19:46.895 --> 03:19:48.876]  I just took some of that on air, for your TV viewer.
[03:19:49.496 --> 03:19:50.177]  That's what it's all about.
[03:19:50.197 --> 03:19:51.277]  So I'm trying to help you, Stern.
[03:19:51.317 --> 03:19:52.878]  You need to take your B12.
[03:19:52.898 --> 03:19:54.319]  You need your iodine.
[03:19:54.359 --> 03:19:55.299]  You need your X2.
[03:19:55.339 --> 03:20:01.842]  Howard Stern needs his X2.
[03:20:06.745 --> 03:20:09.346]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:20.805 --> 03:20:25.946]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:28.687 --> 03:20:41.910]  We'll expand opportunity for striving low-income Americans not to compete with those low-income Americans.
[03:20:47.731 --> 03:21:01.800]  Our proposal fulfills our sacred duty to those living here today while ensuring America remains a welcoming country to immigrants joining us tomorrow.
[03:21:02.460 --> 03:21:04.901]  And we want immigrants coming in.
[03:21:05.542 --> 03:21:10.745]  We cherish the open door that we want to create for our country.
[03:21:12.162 --> 03:21:18.005]  But a big proportion of those immigrants must come in through merit and skill.
[03:21:19.505 --> 03:21:20.065]  All right, folks.
[03:21:20.126 --> 03:21:21.186]  We've got the full speech.
[03:21:21.326 --> 03:21:25.768]  Owen Schroer, in the next hour, is going to be playing it when he takes over in the War Room.
[03:21:26.568 --> 03:21:28.369]  We've got Matt Bracken about to take over.
[03:21:28.389 --> 03:21:31.831]  I want to try to get as many of your calls as possible, and I apologize I can't get to all of them.
[03:21:32.971 --> 03:21:34.772]  We really respect all your calls.
[03:21:34.852 --> 03:21:36.473]  And I have to stop now and just say this.
[03:21:37.693 --> 03:21:41.395]  I didn't plug any last hour things that fund us, and I'm not complaining.
[03:21:43.206 --> 03:21:47.048]  I'm just saying, if people don't financially buy our products, we won't be here.
[03:21:47.929 --> 03:21:53.772]  And a subconscious part of me sometimes I think kind of hopes that because I'm not going to give in, I'm not going to give up, but I could give out.
[03:21:55.052 --> 03:22:00.996]  And I'm just very, very thankful to the listeners for all your support over the years.
[03:22:01.176 --> 03:22:03.137]  And you just don't know how important you are.
[03:22:04.013 --> 03:22:04.433]  Literally.
[03:22:05.074 --> 03:22:07.416]  And I don't want to say I'm guilty always asking for support.
[03:22:08.076 --> 03:22:11.579]  I just know I sound like a baby bird squawking sometimes saying, feed me Seymour.
[03:22:12.819 --> 03:22:15.161]  But these are products you need anyway, so thank you all.
[03:22:15.902 --> 03:22:19.084]  Bunch of big specials are about to end at m4store.com, and I'll just leave it at that.
[03:22:20.045 --> 03:22:24.768]  And... You know, I'm just mad at the enemy that they're so damn evil.
[03:22:26.009 --> 03:22:27.610]  Because I've said this a lot, and I'll say it again.
[03:22:27.650 --> 03:22:31.253]  Man, if they were like Boss Hog or something, and just wanted to run stuff,
[03:22:32.517 --> 03:22:36.040]  I didn't want to sexualize kids and didn't want to kill already born babies and stuff.
[03:22:37.541 --> 03:22:38.602]  I wouldn't be fighting this hard.
[03:22:39.423 --> 03:22:44.368]  And again, I don't feel sorry for myself, but I don't even want to say I'm exhausted.
[03:22:46.069 --> 03:22:48.852]  I'm like a ringwraith now or something.
[03:22:50.733 --> 03:22:53.976]  I'm only alive when I'm fighting and thinking about this.
[03:22:54.857 --> 03:22:55.658]  It's all I do now.
[03:22:57.090 --> 03:22:58.271]  I have dreams about it.
[03:22:59.151 --> 03:23:00.951]  When I'm on the crapper, I'm thinking about it.
[03:23:00.991 --> 03:23:02.132]  When I'm walking down the street.
[03:23:02.932 --> 03:23:10.054]  I mean, I just remember when I used to go fishing and hiking, and even ten years ago, five years ago, and I'm not complaining.
[03:23:10.134 --> 03:23:11.194]  I'm just gone, folks.
[03:23:11.235 --> 03:23:11.655]  I'm gone.
[03:23:11.975 --> 03:23:13.755]  In fact, there's no turning back.
[03:23:16.496 --> 03:23:17.376]  It's all over for me.
[03:23:17.436 --> 03:23:18.717]  I mean, I'm just, I'm gone, folks.
[03:23:19.857 --> 03:23:21.358]  25 years doing this and there's nothing left.
[03:23:22.498 --> 03:23:23.218]  There's nothing left.
[03:23:24.919 --> 03:23:25.419]  Except war.
[03:23:26.906 --> 03:23:28.628]  And that's it.
[03:23:29.568 --> 03:23:30.509]  By the way, I'm fulfilled.
[03:23:32.251 --> 03:23:33.652]  I feel stronger than I've ever felt.
[03:23:35.613 --> 03:23:38.456]  But I'm not the same person I used to be.
[03:23:39.196 --> 03:23:40.177]  I used to be a funny guy.
[03:23:40.197 --> 03:23:40.858]  I used to have fun.
[03:23:41.859 --> 03:23:46.583]  And now, it's just the globalists have really robbed us of our innocence, haven't they?
[03:23:46.603 --> 03:23:50.326]  They've robbed us of being able just to be normal and to just live our lives.
[03:23:54.764 --> 03:23:55.944]  I just don't know what they're going to do next.
[03:23:55.964 --> 03:23:56.745]  They're so damn evil.
[03:23:58.285 --> 03:23:59.786]  And I just study them all day long.
[03:23:59.806 --> 03:24:01.066]  They're just scum.
[03:24:01.106 --> 03:24:11.230]  They're just... They're a bunch of trash, and they're so hateful, and they're such liars, and they're funded by the biggest mass murderers, and they're just so bad.
[03:24:11.350 --> 03:24:19.332]  And you know, in the final equation, they do it because they're weak.
[03:24:21.113 --> 03:24:23.634]  And that's really what evil is, is people just giving in to their weakness.
[03:24:27.073 --> 03:24:31.375]  I just can't believe our country has turned into this.
[03:24:34.037 --> 03:24:38.559]  And I, I don't like the avenues my brain's been going down either.
[03:24:40.060 --> 03:24:40.781]  I just know this.
[03:24:45.163 --> 03:24:45.864]  They will lose.
[03:24:47.424 --> 03:24:53.608]  The question is, how bad's it gonna get before we turn it around?
[03:24:55.171 --> 03:24:57.273]  All right, Lander in Oregon, you're a real trooper.
[03:24:57.513 --> 03:24:59.214]  You win the blue ribbon for holding so long.
[03:25:00.775 --> 03:25:01.476]  Thank you for calling.
[03:25:01.496 --> 03:25:02.156]  What's on your mind?
[03:25:02.176 --> 03:25:03.197]  What should President Trump do?
[03:25:04.418 --> 03:25:11.383]  Well, I liked your four-pillar plan, but I think that right now, it's just like you're saying, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:25:12.063 --> 03:25:18.788]  And as a fourth-dimensional war, a fourth-generation war, we need our comms, our free speech as our number one element.
[03:25:20.783 --> 03:25:27.008]  And most people in what's going to happen aren't even going to be able to judge what's real and what's not real anymore.
[03:25:28.690 --> 03:25:32.253]  That's why having you here on the air talking about this stuff is so important.
[03:25:33.474 --> 03:25:48.466]  Well you said it, the globalists admit, and in 1984 they talk about this, they're removing all the basic pillars of common sense and reality, and for people that live with some pillars of reality we can still navigate it, but for some people that grow up without the pillars, they don't even know where they are.
[03:25:50.370 --> 03:25:51.371]  Yeah, it's really scary, man.
[03:25:52.752 --> 03:25:55.054]  So where do you at a gut level think this is going?
[03:25:56.475 --> 03:26:09.024]  Well, what you were talking about earlier about sort of misinformation about events between patriots and people wearing masks.
[03:26:10.545 --> 03:26:19.732]  I think we need to be able to not just understand false flags, but understand how lots of these people might be controlled.
[03:26:20.683 --> 03:26:25.627]  Using our modern technology, because our modern technology isn't just about RF controls.
[03:26:25.727 --> 03:26:30.712]  It's about controlling the cybernetic inputs into different people's systems.
[03:26:31.312 --> 03:26:42.382]  And we have to get people aware that basically when they're using these big tech platforms, they are ceding a sort of personal control.
[03:26:43.709 --> 03:26:45.570]  I think most people don't think of the technology that way.
[03:27:01.946 --> 03:27:04.247]  Well, you know, being here in Portland, I see that stuff.
[03:27:04.267 --> 03:27:04.628]  It's real, man.
[03:27:28.902 --> 03:27:29.623]  What is it like?
[03:27:29.683 --> 03:27:30.664]  I mean, what's happened to them?
[03:27:30.684 --> 03:27:34.046]  Do they all have like a demonic look in their eye and they all kind of walk like zombies?
[03:27:35.267 --> 03:27:37.629]  Yeah, um, lots of blank stares.
[03:27:37.870 --> 03:27:49.940]  I mean, it's in a kind of lower-class neighborhood where I work, you know, usually once or twice a day there'll be someone running around screaming, convulsing, you know, feces all over the streets.
[03:27:50.701 --> 03:27:52.282]  It's a mess out here, man.
[03:27:53.243 --> 03:27:55.565]  Most people, I'm totally not awake.
[03:27:58.251 --> 03:28:00.392]  In terms of, well, as they walk around their daily lives.
[03:28:00.953 --> 03:28:02.053]  It's a screen sickness.
[03:28:03.254 --> 03:28:12.680]  It's screen sickness, and then they've been programmed by the lowest common denominator, and then now their animal brain, their reptile brain, is in control, and it's here.
[03:28:12.860 --> 03:28:15.421]  You wonder what the apocalypse, what it looks like.
[03:28:15.481 --> 03:28:17.222]  I mean, this is the death of humanity.
[03:28:17.302 --> 03:28:18.383]  Powerful call, Lander.
[03:28:18.423 --> 03:28:19.464]  Thanks for holding for so long.
[03:28:19.804 --> 03:28:20.444]  Glad you got in.
[03:28:20.464 --> 03:28:21.965]  Alright, I apologize to everybody else.
[03:28:24.807 --> 03:28:26.508]  Tiger Woods on TurboForce.
[03:28:27.315 --> 03:28:28.615]  Well, I don't want to hear that call.
[03:28:30.476 --> 03:28:31.777]  And I want to hear Matt Braggin.
[03:28:32.137 --> 03:28:33.877]  And Matt knows sometimes I'm going to preempt him.
[03:28:34.357 --> 03:28:35.518]  He does a great job co-hosting.
[03:28:35.538 --> 03:28:37.038]  But I gotta... We'll go to Matt Braggin.
[03:28:38.119 --> 03:28:43.421]  But I gotta hear from Casey in FEMA Region 2 about Tiger Woods on Turbo Force?
[03:28:45.001 --> 03:28:47.822]  Look, I've been told by folks that play golf with him, he's a lister for years.
[03:28:47.842 --> 03:28:52.544]  I know he's buddies with Trump, but I just... Did he just come back from nowhere with Turbo Force?
[03:28:53.104 --> 03:28:55.005]  That's an endorsement I would definitely need.
[03:28:55.045 --> 03:28:56.185]  That could save the show right there.
[03:28:58.131 --> 03:29:00.113]  I want to hear about this when Matt Braggin takes over.
[03:29:00.433 --> 03:29:02.795]  Faith Goldie might be popping in.
[03:29:03.376 --> 03:29:11.304]  Our powerful line of fluoride free products is the perfect gift for yourself or others who are exploring a healthier, happier lifestyle.

[03:30:06.499 --> 03:30:07.480]  Marcos, thanks for holding.
[03:30:07.520 --> 03:30:09.641]  I really appreciate you joining us on this Friday edition.
[03:30:09.681 --> 03:30:10.241]  What's your view?
[03:30:10.301 --> 03:30:10.922]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[03:30:10.982 --> 03:30:12.102]  I appreciate you having me on.
[03:30:12.142 --> 03:30:13.863]  First off, I wanted to thank you for Bonnie.
[03:30:13.903 --> 03:30:25.250]  You've been using it for a while, but I sent the bottle to my mom, and after taking it for a few days, she called me literally in tears, saying that she could see the knuckles on her fingers again, and, like, the bones in her knees again.
[03:30:25.270 --> 03:30:26.210]  She was ecstatic.
[03:30:26.250 --> 03:30:32.874]  So, personal thank you to you for that, because anybody who makes my mom's life a little bit easier has a special place in my heart.
[03:30:33.034 --> 03:30:33.555]  Tumor-y.
[03:30:34.460 --> 03:30:37.241]  Curry in India is powerful.
[03:30:37.281 --> 03:30:39.521]  The average turmeric product is about 3-5%.
[03:30:39.621 --> 03:30:39.962]  Ours is 95%.
[03:30:40.002 --> 03:30:43.002]  The strongest curcuminoid out there.
[03:30:43.603 --> 03:30:46.263]  So, Advil works great when I got twisted ankle.
[03:30:46.643 --> 03:30:50.044]  This is nature's Advil to the next level.
[03:30:50.624 --> 03:30:52.545]  So that's why Bodies is so incredible.
[03:30:52.585 --> 03:30:54.906]  People should really check it out and support the InfoWars.
[03:30:54.926 --> 03:30:58.347]  So thank you for giving us your testimony about your mother because Bodies is amazing.
[03:30:58.447 --> 03:30:59.227]  Oh yeah, definitely.
[03:31:04.048 --> 03:31:10.657]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:31:11.458 --> 03:31:19.448]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:31:25.103 --> 03:31:26.744]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:31:26.804 --> 03:31:27.764]  This is racketeering.
[03:31:28.025 --> 03:31:28.845]  This is cartels.
[03:31:29.145 --> 03:31:31.186]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:31:31.546 --> 03:31:32.927]  We need it now.
[03:31:33.447 --> 03:31:34.708]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:31:35.128 --> 03:31:43.513]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:31:44.073 --> 03:31:51.877]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:31:52.117 --> 03:31:52.978]  The way to fight back
[03:31:53.618 --> 03:31:58.360]  is to support InfoWars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:31:58.440 --> 03:32:02.242]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:32:02.862 --> 03:32:04.463]  They've not shut down our speech!
[03:32:04.723 --> 03:32:09.986]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:32:10.206 --> 03:32:17.389]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:32:17.730 --> 03:32:18.530]  Are you coming back?
[03:32:19.050 --> 03:32:20.191]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:32:20.791 --> 03:32:21.932]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[03:32:22.152 --> 03:32:24.373]  Paul Watts has launched his own Summit.news.
[03:32:24.413 --> 03:32:26.155]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[03:32:26.395 --> 03:32:30.938]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[03:32:31.178 --> 03:32:33.399]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:32:33.419 --> 03:32:35.241]  InfoWars!
[03:32:35.601 --> 03:32:38.283]  Let's go, man!
[03:32:38.323 --> 03:32:38.403]  Woo!
[03:32:39.753 --> 03:32:42.516]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[03:32:42.536 --> 03:32:43.917]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[03:32:44.377 --> 03:32:46.980]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:32:47.100 --> 03:32:49.262]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:32:49.302 --> 03:32:52.805]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:32:52.825 --> 03:32:55.467]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:32:55.568 --> 03:32:57.810]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:32:57.850 --> 03:32:58.590]  That's where they find it.
[03:32:58.610 --> 03:33:00.132]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:33:00.832 --> 03:33:01.233]  Just go there.
[03:33:06.141 --> 03:33:19.905]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.445 --> 03:33:25.166]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:25.726 --> 03:33:27.487]  Yeah, and Matt Braga's coming up right now.
[03:33:29.394 --> 03:33:32.519]  By the way, I've been going over Trump's presidential plan.
[03:33:32.540 --> 03:33:33.822]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[03:33:34.523 --> 03:33:40.093]  It's a point-based system, and it makes a lot of sense, and a lot of European countries use it.
[03:33:41.522 --> 03:33:43.683]  And so they're going to have trouble calling it evil.
[03:33:44.163 --> 03:33:47.884]  Problem is they're just going to override that with a bunch of refugees and call it refugees like the EU has done.
[03:33:47.904 --> 03:33:50.224]  So we'll continue to track that as it unfolds.
[03:33:50.804 --> 03:33:51.785]  But I've got to go to this caller.
[03:33:51.805 --> 03:33:52.685]  I apologize to the others.
[03:33:52.945 --> 03:33:54.545]  Casey, I'm sure it's wishful thinking.
[03:33:54.565 --> 03:33:56.726]  You're saying, Tyra comes right from nowhere.
[03:33:56.806 --> 03:34:02.767]  Is he on TurboForce, which is an amazing pre-workout and long-term energy system unlike any other?
[03:34:03.888 --> 03:34:07.648]  Or, I mean, Tyra Woods isn't actually taking TurboForce, is he?
[03:34:07.869 --> 03:34:08.689]  That's a good idea, though.
[03:34:08.709 --> 03:34:09.569]  I should try to send him some.
[03:34:10.758 --> 03:34:16.222]  Uh, I'm not entirely sure, but when I was watching the Masters, he was drinking a bottle of Poland Spring that was pink.
[03:34:18.003 --> 03:34:19.143]  Who knows?
[03:34:21.045 --> 03:34:22.606]  I sure love Turbo Force, my friend.
[03:34:22.626 --> 03:34:22.686]  Huh?
[03:34:23.246 --> 03:34:23.766]  Excuse me?
[03:34:23.786 --> 03:34:27.108]  You said, I sure love Turbo Force.
[03:34:27.809 --> 03:34:28.229]  Yeah, I know.
[03:34:28.269 --> 03:34:29.370]  Well, check it out.
[03:34:29.390 --> 03:34:34.233]  I mean, you can go on YouTube, because they showed him a lot, you know, when he was just standing around, because he's a big story.
[03:34:34.273 --> 03:34:35.053]  You know, he's Tiger Woods.
[03:34:35.714 --> 03:34:38.796]  And every once in a while, he'd be sucking on that bottle of Poland Spring, and it was pink.
[03:34:39.631 --> 03:34:41.912]  And I don't know anybody else makes an energy drink that's pink.
[03:34:43.452 --> 03:34:45.253]  Well, last year when he won his first tournament in a long time,
[03:35:03.061 --> 03:35:07.024]  They tried to grill him on, like, you know, degrading the president in some way.
[03:35:07.164 --> 03:35:10.027]  You know, this is what you need in a press conference after a golf tournament, right?
[03:35:10.327 --> 03:35:10.927]  And he wouldn't do it.
[03:35:12.929 --> 03:35:13.970]  I know, he's friends with Trump.
[03:35:14.010 --> 03:35:15.371]  He's been friends with Trump, like, 20 years.
[03:35:15.731 --> 03:35:16.372]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:35:16.492 --> 03:35:18.713]  You know, and he wouldn't, he's like, I'm not the president.
[03:35:18.954 --> 03:35:20.135]  No, forget it.
[03:35:20.175 --> 03:35:21.816]  The media wasn't even talking about his win.
[03:35:21.836 --> 03:35:23.417]  They were talking about his politics.
[03:35:24.078 --> 03:35:26.700]  So, your other point, Casey, times we're living in.
[03:35:27.332 --> 03:35:28.332]  Times we're living in.
[03:35:28.552 --> 03:35:29.993]  Oh, that's an interesting question.
[03:35:30.053 --> 03:35:33.034]  This is the beginning of the printing press, the Internet.
[03:35:33.574 --> 03:35:36.615]  I mean, this is the second wave of the information revolution.
[03:35:37.035 --> 03:35:40.057]  Once we had the printing press, now everyone can have a Bible.
[03:35:40.157 --> 03:35:41.117]  Everyone can have a book.
[03:35:41.497 --> 03:35:42.978]  Everyone could read for themselves.
[03:35:42.998 --> 03:35:46.399]  They weren't being told by other people what everything was.
[03:35:47.179 --> 03:35:54.982]  And this led to the Industrial Revolution, the Information Revolution, all the revolutions that we had from the 14th century through today.
[03:35:55.885 --> 03:36:04.811]  Now, the Internet is the next level, because now, with the electronic media taking over, now the Internet is the electronic media for everyone.
[03:36:05.331 --> 03:36:09.594]  It's basically, it's the printing press for electronic media, and they're trying to stop it.
[03:36:09.914 --> 03:36:13.436]  You know, you being cut off is burning books, or records, for that matter.
[03:36:14.677 --> 03:36:17.598]  That's my opinion on it, and I don't, do I know what to do about it?
[03:36:18.259 --> 03:36:19.940]  I think we just have to fight our way through it.
[03:36:20.805 --> 03:36:24.907]  You know, Gavin McGinnis suing SPLC is a start, you know?
[03:36:25.487 --> 03:36:36.472]  And let me tell you, I'm trying to develop the money to do that so it can be done right, because you can get lawyers to do it quote for free, but then when it gets down to depositions and all the rest of it, it doesn't happen.
[03:36:37.173 --> 03:36:41.795]  We have got the PIs that will work at cost, licensed all over the country.
[03:36:42.195 --> 03:36:44.516]  We've got the helicopter pilots.
[03:36:44.556 --> 03:36:47.818]  We've got, I mean, we're not just going to play games with these groups.
[03:36:47.838 --> 03:36:49.839]  We're going to come after them legally and lawfully.
[03:36:50.419 --> 03:36:55.882]  It just, I haven't pulled the trigger on a few different plans yet because, you know, I saved up some money over the years.
[03:36:55.962 --> 03:36:57.002]  I've spent most of that.
[03:36:57.022 --> 03:36:59.223]  I always wanted to have a backup because I knew this was coming.
[03:36:59.244 --> 03:37:01.104]  So it really does come down to the listeners.
[03:37:01.144 --> 03:37:04.766]  Whatever you do supporting us, you're going to see some fireworks one way or the other.
[03:37:05.046 --> 03:37:05.707]  Thank you, Casey.
[03:37:06.267 --> 03:37:06.547]  All right.
[03:37:06.987 --> 03:37:07.988]  Matt Bracken takes over.
[03:37:08.008 --> 03:37:10.229]  Appreciate him letting me preempt some here we got behind today.
[03:37:10.609 --> 03:37:14.551]  Matt Bracken, enemiesfarmdomestic.com, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism specialist.
[03:37:14.831 --> 03:37:16.532]  Give us his take on the waterfront.
[03:37:16.772 --> 03:37:17.193]  Thanks, Matt.
[03:37:19.314 --> 03:37:19.814]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:37:20.745 --> 03:37:27.507]  Yeah, I was trying to set up a conference call or a call-in with Faith Goldie for this hour, but she's busy.
[03:37:27.527 --> 03:37:35.810]  It didn't work out, but it'd be great to have her on as soon as possible, because I saw there's a lot coming out of Canada right now.
[03:37:37.411 --> 03:37:48.335]  There's a little troika of globalist communists that the Christchurch shooting, the mosque massacres, boosted the status of the
[03:37:49.204 --> 03:37:55.426]  You know, socialist, globalist Prime Minister of New Zealand, whose name is Jacinda Ardern.
[03:37:56.206 --> 03:38:03.108]  And when the mosque shooting happened, even though it's ironic that it was it was live streamed on Facebook.
[03:38:03.668 --> 03:38:13.291]  And so it really could be almost called the Facebook massacre, because that was the vehicle that was used to to spread the images, you know, live globally.
[03:38:13.971 --> 03:38:18.452]  But when this happened, New Zealand, which doesn't have a First or Second Amendment,
[03:38:19.016 --> 03:38:24.639]  They've gone really whole hog both against free speech and against gun rights.
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:29.922]  Now they're sending armed cops to people's houses over social media posts.
[03:38:30.683 --> 03:38:47.212]  And after the mosque massacres, the shooter had put a manifesto up on the internet and very quickly New Zealand made it like a felony to even try to link to this thing or to the Facebook videos.
[03:38:48.257 --> 03:38:57.303]  And what's coming now, they're benefiting from this in terms of using it for a crackdown on conservative social media.
[03:38:58.104 --> 03:39:15.696]  These three in this troika, which is Justin Trudeau of Canada, Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, and Emmanuel Macron, they and other invited leaders are having a meeting in Paris next week called the Christchurch Call.
[03:39:16.423 --> 03:39:22.394]  Now, they're not talking about Sri Lanka, Islamic massacres, anything like that.
[03:39:22.454 --> 03:39:27.363]  This is going to be focused on conservatives and getting us off of the internet.
[03:39:27.998 --> 03:39:37.124]  And they're going to use the Christchurch model where they can just make Internet addresses basically illegal.
[03:39:37.184 --> 03:39:42.107]  Anybody going to them is going to be flagged for further social media censorship.
[03:39:43.228 --> 03:39:46.490]  Certain IPs are just going to be banned and deleted.
[03:39:47.090 --> 03:39:51.233]  So this, in a sense, is really becoming a battle between
[03:39:52.682 --> 03:40:02.650]  I think President Trump and those who want more freedom on the internet and the globalist socialist communists who want less freedom on the internet.
[03:40:03.490 --> 03:40:11.255]  So when when Obama, this is a caller one or two calls ago, made this point, Obama gave away control of the Internet.
[03:40:11.355 --> 03:40:14.737]  Seems like a minor thing, but it was it was really important.
[03:40:15.318 --> 03:40:18.600]  America used to control the Internet and we don't anymore.
[03:40:19.120 --> 03:40:28.446]  So a battle is lining up because it won't matter if we have free speech in the United States, if certain Internet addresses are just banned.
[03:40:29.125 --> 03:40:46.033]  Or deleted or flagged for further social media censorship, you know, across this this increasingly hostile social credit system that we have where, you know, you can be taken off of Patreon, PayPal, even credit cards.
[03:40:46.753 --> 03:40:48.734]  And this is all this is all coming.
[03:40:48.814 --> 03:40:57.158]  And certain social media sites are are going away, like the WordPress site Chateau Hortice have been up for years.
[03:40:58.259 --> 03:41:04.706]  It's been attacked, I think, by the Southern Poverty Law Center, like Gavin McGinnis was talking about, and it's gone.
[03:41:05.426 --> 03:41:18.358]  So, while I've got a moment, I'd like to mention I do have a new book out, and it's stuff that's probably going to be gone from the Internet, you know, if these communists have their way.
[03:41:18.939 --> 03:41:22.963]  It's called The Bracken Collection, and if you get it in hard copy,
[03:41:23.849 --> 03:41:24.970]  It won't be deletable.
[03:41:25.350 --> 03:41:26.831]  It's also going to be on Kindle.
[03:41:27.932 --> 03:41:42.003]  You can pre-order it, but all of these questionable, shaky, right-wing, alt-right sites, there's a real battle going on now, and the rest of the globalist world is going to try to take it down.
[03:41:42.083 --> 03:41:48.367]  It's sort of America versus the world, because we're the only holdout with a true First Amendment.
[03:41:49.128 --> 03:41:53.131]  The rest of the world, and the tech giants like Facebook,
[03:41:53.829 --> 03:42:01.970]  Facebook and Google are happy to work with the Communist Chinese to work with Emmanuel Macron and Trudeau and all of these globalists.
[03:42:02.991 --> 03:42:06.771]  They have no problem with stripping us of our free speech rights.
[03:42:07.371 --> 03:42:13.352]  So, you've only got conservatives in America standing up for the First Amendment.
[03:42:14.533 --> 03:42:17.633]  You've got the Democratic Socialists of America.
[03:42:18.053 --> 03:42:19.474]  They don't want the First Amendment.
[03:42:19.934 --> 03:42:21.794]  You know, if Trump loses, forget it.
[03:42:22.506 --> 03:42:28.311]  And you've got the tech giants that may be American, but their loyalty is purely globalist.
[03:42:28.832 --> 03:42:39.962]  So we need to stand up and make this a real fight and support President Trump and encourage him to go to war for free speech on the internet.
[03:42:40.963 --> 03:42:45.386]  Apparently there's going to be some kind of a blog entry where you can report censorship.
[03:42:47.675 --> 03:42:51.217]  And that's good, but we need to push that as strongly as possible.
[03:42:51.597 --> 03:42:54.538]  Because with 2020 coming, forget the Russians.
[03:42:55.078 --> 03:43:00.901]  Just imagine the power of big social media to twist and suppress conservatism.
[03:43:02.982 --> 03:43:04.002]  I want them shut down.
[03:43:04.042 --> 03:43:04.963]  I want them silenced.
[03:43:05.003 --> 03:43:05.803]  I want them muted.
[03:43:05.843 --> 03:43:07.684]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:43:08.064 --> 03:43:13.827]  They're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have.
[03:43:18.015 --> 03:43:22.176]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[03:43:25.197 --> 03:43:27.377]  Spreading articles, spreading videos, spreading links.
[03:43:27.397 --> 03:43:28.198]  You're going to get demonized.
[03:43:28.218 --> 03:43:29.938]  You're going to get attacked.
[03:43:32.499 --> 03:43:35.720]  It's going to do something terrible like help Trump get re-elected.
[03:43:35.760 --> 03:43:39.181]  That's really what all this is about.
[03:43:39.421 --> 03:43:44.222]  They say that they deem our content and our brands unsafe.
[03:43:47.003 --> 03:43:50.166]  It is the right to be, do, and say whatever you want.
[03:43:50.246 --> 03:43:52.768]  It's about freedom of expression.
[03:43:53.168 --> 03:43:54.869]  I'm a journalist.
[03:43:54.889 --> 03:44:01.254]  I'm a left not interested in telling the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype.
[03:44:01.314 --> 03:44:04.637]  They can say whatever they think and I respect their constitutional right to do it.
[03:44:04.657 --> 03:44:09.861]  I hope they respect my constitutional right.
[03:44:24.172 --> 03:44:28.078]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:44:33.067 --> 03:44:41.550]  A classic InfoWars fan favorite formula, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a must have for any InfoWarrior serious about their oral health.
[03:44:41.650 --> 03:44:45.852]  Featuring natural oils and ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.

[03:44:50.053 --> 03:44:54.815]  We've taken the fluoride out and replaced it with powerful ingredients to help boost your smile.

[03:44:57.176 --> 03:45:01.998]  Power up your morning routine with Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste at the InfoWars store.
[03:45:05.086 --> 03:45:06.067]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[03:45:06.287 --> 03:45:07.809]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[03:45:07.889 --> 03:45:08.269]  Hello.
[03:45:08.390 --> 03:45:13.295]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[03:45:13.415 --> 03:45:14.156]  It's amazing.
[03:45:14.256 --> 03:45:20.002]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever, and the antihistamines
[03:45:20.402 --> 03:45:24.365]  Sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never quite work fully.
[03:45:24.385 --> 03:45:29.370]  They don't block all of the symptoms, they just kind of dry you up, or at least that's what they do for me, if they work at all.
[03:45:29.410 --> 03:45:30.911]  But pollen block, it works.
[03:45:31.111 --> 03:45:32.072]  It stops everything.
[03:45:32.192 --> 03:45:36.215]  I don't get the itchy eyes, I'm not sneezing, and I don't get the irritation.
[03:45:36.375 --> 03:45:37.076]  It is amazing.
[03:45:37.176 --> 03:45:39.459]  This is a known patent out of France.
[03:45:39.479 --> 03:45:40.901]  We have to pay for the patent.
[03:45:41.262 --> 03:45:50.134]  Where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[03:45:50.294 --> 03:45:52.678]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[03:45:52.878 --> 03:45:56.301]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[03:45:56.441 --> 03:45:57.122]  It just works.
[03:45:57.342 --> 03:46:07.872]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms, and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[03:46:07.892 --> 03:46:10.455]  Pollen Block works every single time.
[03:46:10.555 --> 03:46:11.675]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[03:46:11.735 --> 03:46:15.116]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[03:46:15.296 --> 03:46:17.417]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[03:46:17.657 --> 03:46:18.497]  It's very complex.
[03:46:18.517 --> 03:46:19.337]  They don't even know why.
[03:46:19.377 --> 03:46:22.658]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[03:46:23.258 --> 03:46:29.880]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[03:46:30.040 --> 03:46:31.740]  I go out and I do market research.
[03:46:31.900 --> 03:46:34.321]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[03:46:34.521 --> 03:46:35.861]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[03:46:36.181 --> 03:46:44.229]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a bestseller?
[03:46:44.249 --> 03:46:45.990]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:51.295]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[03:46:51.836 --> 03:46:52.356]  It's not here.
[03:46:52.797 --> 03:46:56.240]  So we just made a souped-up version of it and discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[03:46:56.320 --> 03:46:57.641]  M4WarStore.com or 888-253-3139er.
[03:47:06.095 --> 03:47:08.796]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.416 --> 03:47:18.540]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:18.580 --> 03:47:19.901]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:47:19.941 --> 03:47:24.662]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:38.414 --> 03:47:50.464]  I'd like to continue with what I was talking about in the last segment, and while I'm thinking about it, flag this or go on YouTube for as long as she's still on there.
[03:47:50.804 --> 03:47:53.666]  She gets banned once in a while, comes back with a new channel.
[03:47:54.487 --> 03:48:04.495]  On YouTube, she's Faith J. Goldie now, and her new video is called, What the Elites Are Preparing For, or What Are the Elites Preparing For.
[03:48:05.228 --> 03:48:11.013]  And it's amazing how this is getting absolutely no coverage in the United States, which I think is intentional.
[03:48:12.194 --> 03:48:14.156]  Trump was not invited to this conference.
[03:48:14.676 --> 03:48:16.377]  This is a censorship conference.
[03:48:16.417 --> 03:48:21.462]  This is a globalist, socialist, censorship conference.
[03:48:21.682 --> 03:48:25.845]  And what's on the table is not Islamic terror.
[03:48:26.005 --> 03:48:31.290]  It's suppressing conservative thought, the so-called alt-right.
[03:48:33.453 --> 03:48:46.061]  You know, they're going to have a very receptive audience with the big tech CEOs who are going to help as much as they can, you know, to take away our freedom of speech.
[03:48:46.661 --> 03:48:59.649]  We remember a couple years ago, there was an open mic moment where Angela Merkel was caught discussing with Mark Zuckerberg how they would like to cooperate, you know, to get rid of the so-called hate speech on the Internet.
[03:49:00.169 --> 03:49:01.310]  He'd do all that he could.
[03:49:02.218 --> 03:49:03.300]  And this is unfolding.
[03:49:03.741 --> 03:49:11.637]  So as much as we can with what we can, we need to help push Trump because there's not many people in our corner.
[03:49:12.512 --> 03:49:18.536]  Help push Trump towards some kind of, I don't know if it's going to take, you know, executive action.
[03:49:18.816 --> 03:49:24.640]  Trying to push a bill through Congress is going to be futile at this point because the Democrats are running it.
[03:49:25.161 --> 03:49:36.549]  But, you know, we're going to find ourselves in a very small and diminishing echo chamber where conservatives will only be allowed to broadcast within the United States.
[03:49:37.462 --> 03:49:44.123]  Our websites and blogs will virtually be banned outside of the United States where there is no First Amendment.
[03:49:44.683 --> 03:49:55.025]  So this is serious because you'll say, well, I still have my internet, but your reach, your volume is going to be progressively just turned down and down and down.
[03:49:55.745 --> 03:50:05.167]  And with an election coming up, I mean, it cracks me up how I think the Russians spent a couple hundred thousand dollars on disruptive Facebook ads.
[03:50:05.891 --> 03:50:10.155]  And really for both sides, and that was supposed to be, you know, some huge thing.
[03:50:10.235 --> 03:50:21.384]  But just imagine the power of Google, Facebook and Twitter to tilt the playing field with their algorithms, you know, to boost leftist websites and leftist commentators.
[03:50:22.040 --> 03:50:27.141]  And to silence conservatives, you know, Infowars, people like ourselves.
[03:50:27.622 --> 03:50:32.943]  So, it's not enough just to say, hey, I'm still on Facebook, I'm still on Twitter, life is good.
[03:50:33.383 --> 03:50:33.623]  Right.
[03:50:33.963 --> 03:50:42.405]  But if your volume is being turned down to .5 and the Southern Poverty Law Center's volume is turned up to 20, well that has an effect.
[03:50:42.966 --> 03:50:48.287]  One of the previous callers mentioned how, you know, there is a screen sickness and
[03:50:49.048 --> 03:50:56.751]  The Millennials and even Gen Xers, you don't, anybody, myself, you, you don't realize it, but you think, yeah, I have a free choice.
[03:50:56.831 --> 03:50:58.391]  I go on the Internet and I can choose 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[03:51:00.212 --> 03:51:03.853]  But what you don't realize is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we're all chosen for you.
[03:51:04.413 --> 03:51:07.654]  You know, it wasn't a free search result.
[03:51:08.154 --> 03:51:16.217]  It was the search results that were put to you by left wing, you know, social justice warriors that work for big tech.
[03:51:16.886 --> 03:51:23.231]  So, we're progressively being brainwashed without really even knowing it.
[03:51:23.771 --> 03:51:27.734]  Just by thinking, you know, I can go and see whatever I want on the internet.
[03:51:27.894 --> 03:51:31.897]  But the first choices that come up are the choices that they want you to see.
[03:51:32.558 --> 03:51:36.061]  Now, I'd like to switch while I have time, slightly.
[03:51:37.582 --> 03:51:40.064]  The Iran war drums are certainly beating.
[03:51:40.844 --> 03:51:41.765]  And you have to wonder,
[03:51:42.546 --> 03:51:44.487]  You know, why is this happening right now?
[03:51:44.947 --> 03:51:54.029]  Is there truly some intel out there that's so important that Trump feels like he's got to move aircraft carriers and our 70-year-old B-52 fleet?
[03:51:56.530 --> 03:51:57.350]  Perhaps there is.
[03:51:57.970 --> 03:52:10.053]  A problem with having politicized intel agencies, a really big problem, is this the boy who cried wolf paradigm.
[03:52:10.703 --> 03:52:13.985]  Which is an ancient saying that, you know, has a lot of meaning.
[03:52:14.645 --> 03:52:32.755]  When Intel agencies aren't calling balls and strikes, when they're slanted politically, and Brennan was part of this whole Iraq WMD hoax, you know, which was used to drag us into the first Iraq war.
[03:52:34.248 --> 03:52:45.617]  When Americans now distrust the intel agencies in our first reaction, for all we know, there really is, you know, Iran could be preparing nukes on missiles, and who would believe it?
[03:52:46.298 --> 03:52:52.463]  After what happened with the Iraq WMD story, who would ever believe the intel agencies now?
[03:52:53.223 --> 03:52:59.689]  They've burned their credibility, and that's one of the worst consequences
[03:53:00.547 --> 03:53:04.328]  Of having politicized lying intel agencies.
[03:53:04.849 --> 03:53:06.069]  It's the boy who cried wolf.
[03:53:06.569 --> 03:53:13.692]  Even if there's a real reason to go to war with Iran, and I pray to God there is not, and that we don't, nobody's going to believe it.
[03:53:14.212 --> 03:53:22.735]  And this is really, when you consider that Brennan and Comey were communists, are communists, they're just undercover about it.
[03:53:23.692 --> 03:53:38.116]  The best thing that they can do, working really in parallel with what Vladimir Putin would like to do, you know, Putin considers that the fall of the Soviet Union was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century.
[03:53:38.716 --> 03:53:40.596]  That's what Putin truly believes.
[03:53:42.017 --> 03:53:47.678]  And his primary enemy is and will be the United States of America.
[03:53:48.283 --> 03:53:54.066]  You know, a global hegemon with global reach, you know, power across the globe.
[03:53:54.906 --> 03:54:15.995]  If he can trick us or drag us, along with people like Brannon, into attacking Iran now, and we're tied down in a war that is worse than the Iraq War, worse than Afghanistan or Syria, and with global economic consequences, with the Straits of Hormuz closed, with missiles and sea mines,
[03:54:16.837 --> 03:54:19.578]  Well, Russia has got its own energy supply.
[03:54:19.998 --> 03:54:21.519]  They would like nothing to see.
[03:54:21.759 --> 03:54:23.240]  They would like to see nothing more.
[03:54:23.640 --> 03:54:25.340]  Putin and his old KGB buddies.
[03:54:25.741 --> 03:54:38.046]  They would like to see nothing more than America tearing itself to pieces, totally overextended, wrecking its military, using up its ordinance and the West in an economic catastrophe.
[03:54:38.586 --> 03:54:40.987]  So that's what I think is going on.
[03:54:41.007 --> 03:54:43.708]  I hope nothing like that happens.
[03:54:45.129 --> 03:54:51.591]  Now, as far as Lindsey Graham, he's now the darling of the conservatives ever since he stood up for Kavanaugh.
[03:54:52.031 --> 03:54:56.952]  So he's gained a lot of political capital in the last, say, six months.
[03:54:57.532 --> 03:55:03.294]  But Lindsey Graham didn't get the nickname Lindsey Graham-nesty for no reason.
[03:55:03.694 --> 03:55:12.456]  So when we see Trump's proposals on the border, you can just bet we're going to get shafted again with another big omnibus
[03:55:14.071 --> 03:55:14.592]  Amnesty
[03:55:26.858 --> 03:55:39.366]  A demographic invasion, which the Democrats love because they see every one of these, you know, Guatemalan and El Salvadoran kids as a future dreamer, a future Democrat voter.
[03:55:39.726 --> 03:55:42.148]  You know, they come over at age 7 or 13.
[03:55:42.228 --> 03:55:44.809]  Imagine how many elections they'll be voting in.
[03:55:45.150 --> 03:55:47.031]  And they're going to be voting for welfare.
[03:55:47.351 --> 03:55:49.492]  They're going to be voting for free medical.
[03:55:49.512 --> 03:55:51.314]  They're going to be voting for free education.
[03:55:51.614 --> 03:55:53.295]  That means they're going to be voting Democrat.
[03:55:53.855 --> 03:56:02.343]  So there's no way that the Democrats in Congress are going to approve any bill that comes out of a Lindsey Graham or a Donald Trump.
[03:56:02.963 --> 03:56:10.510]  And what Donald Trump needs to do is use his authority as the Commander-in-Chief to put military forces on the border.
[03:56:10.550 --> 03:56:11.771]  I've said it over and over again.
[03:56:12.481 --> 03:56:19.928]  Three-strand and then six-strand concertina from coast to coast, backed up with military ready-to-fire tear gas.
[03:56:19.968 --> 03:56:25.033]  You don't have to wait until a hundred or a thousand people are rushing the border.
[03:56:25.633 --> 03:56:32.339]  You can loudspeaker them and gas them with tear gas, pepper spray, in Mexico.
[03:56:32.780 --> 03:56:35.943]  What country just allows itself to be overrun?
[03:56:36.613 --> 03:56:41.616]  That's why they call the GOP the stupid party, and the Democrats the evil party.
[03:56:42.017 --> 03:56:43.878]  The Democrats know what they're doing.
[03:56:44.579 --> 03:56:46.180]  This is the great replacement.
[03:56:46.220 --> 03:56:48.822]  This is a demographic replacement.
[03:56:49.202 --> 03:57:04.973]  They are bringing in future Democrat welfare voters, and the Republicans, even Trump, are too timid and politically correct to call it out as what's happening, which is a planned, calculated, demographic invasion.
[03:57:05.686 --> 03:57:19.131]  The American Democrat globalists and the George Soros globalists are working hand-in-glove to bum-rush our country with millions of new future Democrat welfare voters.
[03:57:19.551 --> 03:57:20.711]  That's what's going on.
[03:57:21.231 --> 03:57:26.593]  And Trump can stop it, but he needs to take the gloves off and say, the hell with Congress.
[03:57:27.133 --> 03:57:28.994]  I can do this as Commander-in-Chief.
[03:57:29.614 --> 03:57:33.375]  Protecting the border from invasion is right in the Constitution.
[03:57:33.815 --> 03:57:35.176]  He needs to just do it.
[03:57:35.871 --> 03:57:40.572]  Anyway, I'll be back next week and we'll see what's going on.
[03:57:40.712 --> 03:57:48.774]  But follow what's happening in Paris with this social media censorship conference because it's going to have consequences here.
[03:57:49.474 --> 03:57:52.255]  And so this is Matt Bracken and I'm signing off.
[03:57:52.515 --> 03:58:01.937]  And this shocking footage is even more painful when you see the albatrosses of CNN and other MSM outlets cheering on the rape.
[03:58:02.637 --> 03:58:13.042]  In fact, it's been found that these systems actually direct the monstrous SEAL, Zuckerberg, against the free speech enemies and anyone that tries to not submit.
[03:58:13.762 --> 03:58:25.447]  But most sad of all is other penguins in the independent media, simply looking up at the sky and ignoring the vicious rape of their own freedoms and birthright taking place right in front of them.
[03:58:26.808 --> 03:58:29.489]  After enduring over an hour of the assault,
[03:58:30.476 --> 03:58:32.818]  Our dear penguin finally succumbs.
[03:58:33.598 --> 03:58:46.128]  But one more vicious insult is heaped upon its broken body by CNN, as its identity is stolen, gobbled up and devoured, and uses a straw man to attack other penguins.
[03:58:48.850 --> 03:58:50.151]  This is CNN.
[03:58:55.295 --> 03:58:56.856]  We are in a complete war!
[03:58:56.956 --> 03:58:58.997]  And you idiots don't join with the Republic!
[03:58:59.017 --> 03:58:59.598]  You fools!
