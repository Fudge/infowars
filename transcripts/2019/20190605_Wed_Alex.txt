[00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.668]  It's Wednesday, June 5th, 2019.
[00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:19.208]  We're live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:21.648]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:31.470]  And I've really been pondering what's happening in the world and what the globalists are up to versus what free humanity is up to.
[00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.852]  And I'm going to really try my best today to calmly, we'll see how long that lasts, try to walk through some of this.
[00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:57.927]  From the perspective as if we're historians looking back on a great war that took place because there is a great war taking place being directed by the forces of evil against the forces of good and it really does come down to that.
[00:00:57.927 --> 00:01:08.556]  This world is about good and evil and it's about the evil that lurks in the hearts of men growing and organizing and metastasizing and taking over.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.728]  And it's about the cycles we go through when humanity finally wakes up and deals with it.
[00:01:16.728 --> 00:01:20.591]  But it's evil for evil's sake, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:30.622]  And we see so many examples of this manifesting, not just on television or not just on the Internet, but in the real world, when we're out in the streets or in communities.
[00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:41.815]  A true spirit, an operating system of kill, steal and destroy is expanding right now.
[00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:46.681]  Now you are seeing a lot of resistance mounting to that.
[00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:50.926]  In the Newtonian physics for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:01:52.483 --> 00:02:05.367]  But I'm going to really attempt today to go through the different crises in the world that are being organized and focused and exacerbated by the globalists towards their end.
[00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:09.288]  And they admit that this is their larger plan.
[00:02:09.288 --> 00:02:10.828]  Why are they collapsing the borders?
[00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:12.509]  Why are they attacking the family?
[00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:18.552]  Why are they trying to open the borders to radical Islam?
[00:02:18.552 --> 00:02:25.655]  Why are they trying to undermine the family and any type of independence and the right to self-defense?
[00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:30.037]  Because that's what you do when you are conquering a group of people.
[00:02:30.037 --> 00:02:34.279]  And I know that our great audience of radio and TV viewers, Internet viewers,
[00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:54.589]  Understands this better than I do in many ways, but we have to discuss and face the fact that the enemy is admittedly trying to condition us incrementally by successful approximation to accept the next phase of their operations.
[00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:56.071]  So that's all going to be coming up.
[00:02:57.762 --> 00:03:13.011]  Here today, just the stacks of news, I have three of them dealing with the border, is the last two DHS heads, Democrats, the current DHS head, the heads of the Los Angeles government now admit it.
[00:03:13.011 --> 00:03:23.878]  They're all admitting that their cities are collapsing into medieval squalor and that it's only getting worse and something's happening to the public.
[00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:28.374]  And more and more people are refusing to work.
[00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:37.882]  Well, just on my way into the office this morning, I dodged zombie-like homeless people three times.
[00:03:37.882 --> 00:03:41.185]  Now, I don't live in the city, in the main part of the city.
[00:03:41.185 --> 00:03:42.747]  Our offices are not in the main part of the city.
[00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:55.157]  In two of the cases, the police were already on the scene with men that looked, again, like zombies.
[00:03:55.157 --> 00:04:07.108]  Ribs shrunk in, one guy was in his underwear, feces streaming down his leg, running out into the street, almost causing a car wreck, because five or six cars in front of me slammed their brakes on.
[00:04:07.108 --> 00:04:11.613]  Then I get up another mile or so down the road, run into something similar.
[00:04:12.517 --> 00:04:14.238]  Then I get close to the office.
[00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:16.760]  They're stumbling out in traffic, trying to be hit.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.661]  Wild-eyed.
[00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:21.744]  This is a manifestation of the true evil.
[00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:27.828]  And the drugs, and the alcohol, and the opioids, and the laziness, and just the breakdown of society.
[00:04:27.828 --> 00:04:30.710]  And it's accelerating, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.092]  It's like Day of the Dead out there.
[00:04:33.092 --> 00:04:36.394]  And it's only going to get worse.
[00:04:36.394 --> 00:04:37.635]  It's all planned.
[00:04:37.635 --> 00:04:39.577]  Latin America is collapsing.
[00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:45.532]  Because of the corruption, and the greed, and the violence, and the evil.
[00:04:45.532 --> 00:04:48.955]  We are collapsing because of the violence, the greed, and the evil.
[00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.776]  And the loss of family and soul.
[00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:53.939]  I don't say all this to demoralize you.
[00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:55.981]  I say it to raise the alarm.
[00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:57.382]  We'll look at it all when we come right back.
[00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:05.481]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:14.044]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:05:14.044 --> 00:05:17.025]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:18.765]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:05:18.765 --> 00:05:25.047]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:05:27.128 --> 00:05:32.451]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:05:32.451 --> 00:05:35.413]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:05:35.413 --> 00:05:39.015]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:05:39.015 --> 00:05:43.317]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:45.138]  I've got two in my home.
[00:05:45.138 --> 00:05:51.241]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:52.082]  Don't live
[00:05:52.902 --> 00:05:56.965]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[00:05:56.965 --> 00:05:58.446]  Go to infowarsstore.com.
[00:05:58.446 --> 00:06:02.669]  Another world.
[00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:03.670]  Another time.
[00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.891]  In the age of wonder.
[00:06:28.681 --> 00:06:30.762]  It's Wednesday, June 5th, 2019.
[00:06:30.762 --> 00:06:32.342]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:32.342 --> 00:06:34.542]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:06:34.542 --> 00:06:36.803]  This country is in a war.
[00:06:36.803 --> 00:06:41.144]  The nation-state is in a war.
[00:06:41.144 --> 00:06:42.244]  For its very survival.
[00:06:42.244 --> 00:06:43.124]  Civilization.
[00:06:55.825 --> 00:07:02.572]  He's in a war with a corporate global government that is forming a breakaway civilization.
[00:07:03.772 --> 00:07:31.114]  That is exempt from our taxes, our regulations, that siphons off our technology, our money, our resources, and then in turn gives us nothing but collapsed third world populations to sink us into ignorant squalor and oblivion while the establishment breaks away and prepares the next move, the forced depopulation operation,
[00:07:32.122 --> 00:07:38.185]  Which you'll be begging for by the time they implement it.
[00:07:38.185 --> 00:07:42.027]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:07:42.027 --> 00:07:59.976]  But there are forces in places like Japan, and places like Brazil, and places like the UK to a certain extent, and the United States, that want to get off of the globalist, social engineering, designed, post-industrial, post-human era plan.
[00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:07.897]  That I've been talking about for 20 plus years that now you see is mainline all over TV, all over radio, all over culture.
[00:08:07.897 --> 00:08:09.338]  Humans are a disease.
[00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:09.898]  We're bad.
[00:08:09.898 --> 00:08:11.278]  We should be gotten rid of.
[00:08:11.278 --> 00:08:12.159]  You shouldn't have children.
[00:08:13.513 --> 00:08:15.194]  We should kill babies after they're born.
[00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:17.196]  They're subhuman trash.
[00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.037]  It's so much fun to have an abortion.
[00:08:19.037 --> 00:08:21.779]  It's sexually pleasurable.
[00:08:21.779 --> 00:08:25.762]  Vice and CNN say to have an abortion, it's a new fetish.
[00:08:25.762 --> 00:08:28.864]  Yes, you're talking beyond anything you ever heard in a horror movie.
[00:08:28.864 --> 00:08:34.868]  By the way, we're going to play some of those news clips coming up later in the second hour today.
[00:08:34.868 --> 00:08:39.211]  I mentioned it yesterday from the archives and some of the new statements, but we actually pulled them in.
[00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:42.393]  We'll have that for you in the second hour.
[00:08:44.022 --> 00:08:46.563]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[00:08:46.563 --> 00:09:07.008]  Not because anything's graphic, but because the woman and women cremally, sexually talking about how much fun it is to kill babies and how good it feels and how much they love chopping those little bastards up, and then the fake orgasm noises, is the height of any horror you've ever seen.
[00:09:07.008 --> 00:09:08.929]  But it isn't fantasy, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:09.958 --> 00:09:17.885]  It's reality because truth is way more evil than any fiction that can be imagined by a sick brain.
[00:09:17.885 --> 00:09:22.369]  This is the left now wallowing in total evil.
[00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:34.760]  You know, I told you several times on air that one of our crew went to Sundance Film Festival in my stead and he came back very shaken.
[00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:52.837]  And he said that he went to all these dinners, all these events, and they said, the mission is to depress everyone and to be as shocking as possible and overturn all norms.
[00:09:52.837 --> 00:09:54.579]  And that's what's being funded.
[00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:56.100]  And of course, they didn't really understand why.
[00:09:57.128 --> 00:10:21.671]  Well, I do know why, because I've read the Ford Foundation and the Central Intelligence Agency's own admissions from the 1950s about the cultural revolution they launched here in the so-called free love era and everything, and that it was meant to break up families, turn women into sexual objects, completely destroy any freedom they have in the name of freedom, and turn men into arrested development morons.
[00:10:22.612 --> 00:10:38.788]  And then finally they would then start chemicalizing the children when they were so desperate, telling them that there weren't two genders, and that the only way that they could be cool would be to somehow change their body a la Brave New World.
[00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:41.911]  And how do you get someone to embrace servitude to slavery?
[00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:46.276]  As Huxley said, you get them to love their servitude by making it cool.
[00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.772]  Women did not smoke cigarettes until the 1920s.
[00:10:51.772 --> 00:10:57.134]  It was seen as uncouth, it was seen as dirty.
[00:10:57.134 --> 00:11:06.019]  They would smoke cigars because cigars were ladylike and that's why they had the pretty band on them so that women wouldn't get nicotine on their white gloves.
[00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:08.900]  But women would smoke in private.
[00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.262]  That was the style from Europe, from Spain going back 500 years.
[00:11:12.262 --> 00:11:17.925]  After the discovery of tobacco in Cuba by the conquistadors, but I digress.
[00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:32.302]  They had propagandists of the time, Edward Bernays, pay millions of dollars, which is the equivalent of billions today, to all the women's groups to have them walk and smoke the cigarettes and say, I have the freedom.
[00:11:32.302 --> 00:11:36.785]  Just like Virginia Slims 50 years later said, you've come a long way, babe.
[00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:39.668]  You too are going to get lung cancer now.
[00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:42.971]  So it's all a cold-blooded manipulation.
[00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:47.592]  And by the way, they knew cigarettes gave you lung cancer 200 years ago.
[00:11:47.592 --> 00:12:05.891]  So it's also another little sick thing, like Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly, again, shipping out millions of ampoules of Factor VIII blood product, knowing the clotting agent had HIV and hepatitis in every dose, a death sentence.
[00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:18.519]  But don't worry, Bayer had the drugs and then treat the HIV and the Hepatitis.
[00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:23.965]  You see, that's not some horror movie with imaginary things going on.
[00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:26.188]  That's the real world.
[00:12:28.214 --> 00:12:38.796]  Oh, but don't worry, Antifa's gonna protect us from all those nationalists and all those anti-vaxxers and people from, because they're Nazis, except Bayer really were the Nazis.
[00:12:38.796 --> 00:12:40.676]  Oh, but it doesn't matter.
[00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:43.197]  I digress.
[00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:55.619]  The point is, everything with The Globalist is about even if you're moral and love God and love justice, searing your conscience, throwing evil in your face, until you just feel overwhelmed and give up.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:18.054]  That's why we have to consciously, as humans do, separating ourselves from the animal kingdom, understand the condition, understand the manipulation, understand the psychological warfare event, and then consciously not let them break our will.
[00:13:18.054 --> 00:13:22.377]  And then once you turn your will towards not letting this grind you down,
[00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:29.148]  Or not letting it make you give up or feel helpless, then you're going to get stronger under the enemy attack.
[00:13:29.148 --> 00:13:36.493]  Instead of letting weights just crush you, say like 200 pounds on your chest, bench pressing, and you haven't been working out in a while, and you just kind of give up.
[00:13:36.493 --> 00:13:38.975]  If you had that on your chest, it would end up suffocating you.
[00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:41.256]  It would end up basically crucifying you.
[00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:41.877]  It would kill you.
[00:13:41.877 --> 00:13:45.199]  Put the pressure on your diaphragm, and you would give up.
[00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:46.460]  You would die.
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.102]  If you were tied down with 200 pounds on your chest.
[00:13:50.102 --> 00:13:52.424]  But if you're conscious that you could push it off,
[00:13:53.643 --> 00:13:55.284]  Well, you get stronger.
[00:13:55.284 --> 00:13:58.787]  And they keep throwing weight on you, and you get stronger.
[00:13:58.787 --> 00:14:07.953]  And in my 25 years of all I've gone through, I've now more and more have seen God's perfect plan, how God didn't give me too much that I couldn't handle 25 years ago.
[00:14:07.953 --> 00:14:16.359]  And now, I was able to build the dose up under the pressure, thanks to God, and now can handle pressure that almost no one else can handle.
[00:14:16.359 --> 00:14:19.741]  And I'm not bragging about it, it's just a known fact.
[00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:22.904]  That we have learned, this crew has learned, my family has learned.
[00:14:23.854 --> 00:14:33.977]  By successful approximation, by adapting and overcoming, not giving in and being a victim, but fighting back, we have become stronger and the enemies become weaker.
[00:14:33.977 --> 00:14:36.918]  Now that's those of us that are awake though.
[00:14:36.918 --> 00:14:47.601]  For those that aren't awake, they are entering into a malaise, a bygone, a swamp, and really giving up.
[00:14:47.601 --> 00:14:50.622]  When the conscious mind gives up and when the good parts of the soul give up,
[00:14:52.335 --> 00:14:55.096]  Then people really get deeper into a trance.
[00:14:55.096 --> 00:14:58.277]  They stop caring and then they start adopting the nastiness.
[00:14:58.277 --> 00:14:59.697]  They start adopting the evil.
[00:14:59.697 --> 00:15:05.759]  They start adopting the systems and the culture without even knowing it.
[00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:13.021]  So they never knew they were in a fight for their lives because the world told them evil didn't exist and government and Hollywood love you when it's all the opposite.
[00:15:13.021 --> 00:15:14.021]  That is people running the government.
[00:15:16.806 --> 00:15:18.607]  And so, you're seeing it.
[00:15:18.607 --> 00:15:27.211]  You're seeing depression explode, suicide explode, cancer explode, IQs dropping, neurological disorders exploding, all over the world.
[00:15:27.211 --> 00:15:30.193]  And it's because it's all being done scientifically.
[00:15:30.193 --> 00:15:31.713]  We're being inflicted.
[00:15:31.713 --> 00:15:32.794]  We're being poisoned.
[00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:34.175]  We're being hit.
[00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:35.835]  We're being stunned.
[00:15:35.835 --> 00:15:36.696]  We're being corrupted.
[00:15:37.631 --> 00:15:39.192]  And the globalists admit this in their own documents.
[00:15:39.192 --> 00:15:40.112]  This is not my opinion.
[00:15:40.112 --> 00:15:42.654]  Everybody knows this, but we need to be conscious about it and warn others.
[00:15:42.654 --> 00:15:44.155]  It's like the Golden Child.
[00:15:44.155 --> 00:15:55.381]  It's a fiction film, but it's a good allegory where they can't kill the Golden Child, the devil can't, his demon can't, until they get him to eat the blood of sacrificed, tortured children.
[00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:57.282]  What do you think Pepsi puts in its drinks?
[00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:00.788]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.788 --> 00:16:04.709]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:06.250]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.211]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:14.772]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:35.400]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.442]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:16:38.442 --> 00:16:44.366]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:16:44.366 --> 00:16:48.169]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:16:48.169 --> 00:16:49.430]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:50.771]  Who do we fight for?
[00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:56.975]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:03.859]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.859 --> 00:18:05.640]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:17.710]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:22.714]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.474 --> 00:18:32.641]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:37.925]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.925 --> 00:18:40.547]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.547 --> 00:18:42.268]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.268 --> 00:18:51.676]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.918]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.918 --> 00:19:00.562]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.562 --> 00:19:02.564]  They've not shut down our speech!
[00:19:02.564 --> 00:19:07.407]  We're at Infowars.com and Newswars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:19:07.407 --> 00:19:14.933]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:16.234]  Are you coming back?
[00:19:16.234 --> 00:19:17.375]  We're at Infowars.com.
[00:19:17.975 --> 00:19:19.256]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[00:19:19.256 --> 00:19:21.598]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[00:19:21.598 --> 00:19:22.519]  We have our own videos.
[00:19:22.519 --> 00:19:23.600]  We have our own articles.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.344]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[00:19:28.344 --> 00:19:30.606]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:19:30.606 --> 00:19:32.167]  InfoWars!
[00:19:32.167 --> 00:19:33.868]  Don't tell me!
[00:19:33.868 --> 00:19:34.209]  Whoo!
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.641]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:19:39.641 --> 00:19:41.541]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:19:41.541 --> 00:19:44.602]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:19:44.602 --> 00:19:46.502]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:19:46.502 --> 00:19:49.983]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:19:49.983 --> 00:19:52.724]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:55.004]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:19:55.004 --> 00:19:56.004]  That's where they find it.
[00:19:56.004 --> 00:19:57.825]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:19:57.825 --> 00:19:58.405]  Just go there.
[00:20:03.397 --> 00:20:16.987]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:16.987 --> 00:20:23.372]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:23.372 --> 00:20:25.494]  I've told this story about a hundred times.
[00:20:26.448 --> 00:20:31.031]  I'm going to tell it again and then I'm going to get into all the huge, unbelievable breaking news.
[00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:37.876]  The globalists openly trying to collapse our country and other nations and just the amazing treason and how it can be stopped.
[00:20:37.876 --> 00:20:39.757]  We're very close to getting that done.
[00:20:39.757 --> 00:20:50.365]  That's why the enemy wants us off air because they don't want you to have a focal point and a rallying point to take this fight to the halls of victory.
[00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:54.007]  I've told the story many times of when I was going to be on The View.
[00:20:54.007 --> 00:20:54.988]  It's got to be like 10, 12, 13 years ago.
[00:20:57.663 --> 00:20:59.443]  And I'm in First Class American Airlines.
[00:20:59.443 --> 00:21:00.924]  That's how they flew me up there.
[00:21:00.924 --> 00:21:03.624]  And there's the head of one of the big three banks.
[00:21:03.624 --> 00:21:05.945]  And he said, this is an off-the-record conversation.
[00:21:05.945 --> 00:21:07.445]  And I'm a person that honors that.
[00:21:07.445 --> 00:21:10.285]  So it was an off-the-record conversation.
[00:21:10.285 --> 00:21:14.566]  And at the end, I started arguing with him.
[00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:17.727]  We've been talking off and on for about three hours.
[00:21:17.727 --> 00:21:21.268]  He looked at me and he said, listen, you're not going to win.
[00:21:21.268 --> 00:21:22.828]  The public is going to adapt.
[00:21:24.656 --> 00:21:28.819]  To what we're going to do in the system we're building.
[00:21:28.819 --> 00:21:30.560]  And that's the way it works.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.041]  They don't adapt and overcome.
[00:21:32.041 --> 00:21:34.162]  They adapt and they submit.
[00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:36.183]  So you're on the wrong team.
[00:21:36.183 --> 00:21:37.064]  You just don't understand.
[00:21:37.064 --> 00:21:38.285]  Humanity's broken.
[00:21:38.285 --> 00:21:39.085]  It's fallen.
[00:21:39.085 --> 00:21:39.886]  It's stupid.
[00:21:39.886 --> 00:21:43.408]  And you might as well stop treating them like they deserve any freedom.
[00:21:43.408 --> 00:21:44.849]  They don't care about you.
[00:21:44.849 --> 00:21:48.491]  And they'll tear you apart if you try to help them.
[00:21:48.491 --> 00:21:50.272]  Now that's somebody that's given up on humanity.
[00:21:50.272 --> 00:21:52.474]  That's somebody that's got a very cynical view of people.
[00:21:54.599 --> 00:21:55.240]  But you know what?
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.142]  He understands their whole ball game.
[00:21:58.142 --> 00:22:02.485]  They are putting all of these horrible movies and TV shows out.
[00:22:02.485 --> 00:22:08.570]  Every major tech platform, every major production house is sexualizing children.
[00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.414]  I remember like 15 years ago, Nickelodeon documents came out.
[00:22:13.414 --> 00:22:18.178]  It was even on PBS back then when I guess there was still some soul left in this country.
[00:22:18.178 --> 00:22:21.981]  And they were talking about how they were planning to sexualize children down to age 5.
[00:22:25.387 --> 00:22:35.852]  Because if they could brand them to a sexual orientation, they could tie it to products much stronger for life.
[00:22:35.852 --> 00:22:50.358]  And of course, that's what came out yesterday with Snapchat, was that Love Knows No Ages, an actual NAMBLA slogan that then puts a video filter over the screen when you're sending Snapchats around with a NAMBLA slogan.
[00:22:52.529 --> 00:22:55.410]  And I guess the pedophiles can contact your kids that way.
[00:22:55.410 --> 00:23:13.634]  And you've got all of this, this avalanche of this, and all these convicted pedophiles dressed up in clown makeup, in disguises, being brought into schools, in many cases without parents being told, for children as young as five to sit on their laps.
[00:23:13.634 --> 00:23:14.134]  It's a plan.
[00:23:15.478 --> 00:23:18.380]  It's a program to make people give up.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.262]  So see, all these years, I'm here fighting back against this.
[00:23:21.262 --> 00:23:22.502]  I believe we can stop it.
[00:23:22.502 --> 00:23:24.063]  We've seen a lot of evidence we can't.
[00:23:24.063 --> 00:23:25.564]  Plus, it's the right thing to do.
[00:23:25.564 --> 00:23:28.306]  But see, they see us as an anomaly.
[00:23:28.306 --> 00:23:38.773]  And they talked about this in Jade Helm 2015 document the Pentagon put out, where they admitted it's for monitoring social media in America during a martial law takeover that Obama was testing.
[00:23:38.773 --> 00:23:39.873]  That's what's in there.
[00:23:39.873 --> 00:23:41.855]  We weren't saying it was going to be a physical imminent takeover.
[00:23:41.855 --> 00:23:43.115]  That was the media lie.
[00:23:43.115 --> 00:23:43.736]  The document
[00:23:45.123 --> 00:23:52.066]  And subsequent power points given by the Pentagon, we've played them here, anybody can pull them up, admitted all of that.
[00:23:52.066 --> 00:23:59.909]  So again, it's not that the Pentagon's bad, it's that the globalists in control of our government are in control of it to a great extent.
[00:23:59.909 --> 00:24:04.751]  It's not that the federal government itself is bad, it's that it's got a lot of bad people in control of it.
[00:24:04.751 --> 00:24:12.254]  And that's why they're so upset about Trump, because he could get a beachhead, and start turning it around, and give other people hope,
[00:24:13.653 --> 00:24:27.399]  And other people believe in the nation-state that isn't perfect, but is way better than globalism, where it's one world government that you can't reach out to, that you can't veto, that you can't override, that you can't vote against.
[00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:40.825]  And so I was thinking back to the North American Union documents that came out many years ago, and the TPP and all of it, and they say, we're going to use migrant flows and migrant crises to break the nation-state and force
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:51.927]  Three unions, the Asian Union, the European Union, and the North American Union that will then expand into these other unions.
[00:24:51.927 --> 00:24:56.550]  And there'll be ten global heads over three super regions.
[00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.573]  That's directly, by the way, out of Revelation.
[00:25:00.573 --> 00:25:09.739]  And so when you hear about, and you see the videos of just giant hordes of people pouring across the border with diseases, you name it, and the media is saying nothing's happening, there are no
[00:25:11.345 --> 00:25:12.225]  Caravans.
[00:25:12.225 --> 00:25:13.966]  It's made up.
[00:25:13.966 --> 00:25:16.126]  That's a military tactic.
[00:25:16.126 --> 00:25:19.047]  They started in World War I where they would bullhorn, we're not assaulting.
[00:25:19.047 --> 00:25:23.648]  And of course they were really assaulting.
[00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:25.229]  And so you know what's going on.
[00:25:25.229 --> 00:25:25.989]  I know what's going on.
[00:25:25.989 --> 00:25:35.611]  We've got to get the word out to people that this is incredibly serious business.
[00:25:35.611 --> 00:25:37.192]  And it's incredibly dangerous.
[00:25:39.352 --> 00:25:43.595]  If you just think we're going to be under some North American Union and everything's going to be okay once we submit to the globalists.
[00:25:43.595 --> 00:25:47.057]  They don't just want power over the money and the geography.
[00:25:47.057 --> 00:25:56.983]  They want power over your children, over your husband, over your wife, over your property, over your body, over everything.
[00:25:56.983 --> 00:25:58.744]  So they're not coming for us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:58.744 --> 00:26:00.245]  They're here.
[00:26:00.245 --> 00:26:01.026]  And they represent
[00:26:02.017 --> 00:26:03.697]  Calculated cold-blooded evil.
[00:26:03.697 --> 00:26:12.879]  You know, at the end of the last segment I talked about Pepsi that would use baby parts, baby tissue, in their flavor testing systems.
[00:26:12.879 --> 00:26:16.219]  People go, oh, it's not actually in the drink, they just use it in the flavor testing.
[00:26:16.219 --> 00:26:27.902]  Doesn't matter, it's all part of turning humans into a commodity openly, beyond slavery, and getting us to dehumanize ourselves and take part in seeing other humans not being treated with dignity.
[00:26:27.902 --> 00:26:30.422]  Once that happens, it metaphysically removes the hedge
[00:26:31.638 --> 00:26:32.598]  It's spiritual.
[00:26:32.598 --> 00:26:33.699]  It's electromagnetic.
[00:26:33.699 --> 00:26:36.560]  It's a law of nature and evil can come in.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.740]  So evil knows how to trick you to acquiesce.
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:45.783]  How about the fact that most vaccines are grown on fetal tissue?
[00:26:45.783 --> 00:26:47.483]  By the way, do you know what comes with that?
[00:26:47.483 --> 00:26:51.865]  You know, they figured this out back in Leviticus 3,000 years ago.
[00:26:51.865 --> 00:26:55.906]  You also get all those other viruses that are in the human tissue.
[00:26:57.273 --> 00:27:07.016]  And all the other cancer cells, and God knows what else, that then leaches into the rest of your DNA, which has been proven.
[00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:14.898]  There's the headline, PBS NewsHour, scientists say fetal tissue remains essential for vaccines and developing treatments.
[00:27:14.898 --> 00:27:15.638]  See how that works?
[00:27:17.048 --> 00:27:22.133]  And so if we won't stand up for the defenseless, how do you think any of us are going to be stood up to?
[00:27:22.133 --> 00:27:30.440]  Because I happen to run into Salem's Lot on YouTube, a book Stephen King wrote back in 75, made into a movie in 79.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.902]  It's a ripoff of Nosferatu.
[00:27:31.902 --> 00:27:36.186]  It's even the same, you know, German vampire from Germany.
[00:27:36.186 --> 00:27:39.228]  Basically Nosferatu II, Stephen King's plagiarist name on it.
[00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:56.937]  It's so scary how the familiar, the Renfield, goes and gets the little boys and girls and takes them in and the vampire drinks their blood.
[00:27:56.937 --> 00:28:07.063]  But see, we inject into our children vaccine garbage grown on dead baby's tissue with all the pollutants and all of it.
[00:28:08.422 --> 00:28:14.506]  They sat him on the drag queen's knee, who's really a man in a mask.
[00:28:14.506 --> 00:28:15.787]  Masked men.
[00:28:15.787 --> 00:28:18.289]  Many of them convicted pedophiles.
[00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:20.031]  We bring our children to mask men.
[00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:35.142]  And San Francisco, I mentioned it yesterday, we'll play the clip coming up next segment, celebrates and says, come into dungeons with feces of rats and have rats on your table, eat your meal with you.
[00:28:35.142 --> 00:28:36.683]  She is celebrating it.
[00:28:38.312 --> 00:28:40.995]  Oh, but a movie with a vampire is too unbelievable.
[00:28:40.995 --> 00:28:47.482]  But in the real world, keeping babies alive after they're born, put them in an oxygen tent for a week.
[00:28:47.482 --> 00:28:50.946]  I was talking to a nurse from Omaha just two weeks ago that was visiting down here.
[00:28:50.946 --> 00:28:55.411]  She says, yeah, actually, I know some nurses that do that, but that's how you do you.
[00:28:55.411 --> 00:28:57.653]  You gotta keep them alive to get the organs.
[00:28:57.653 --> 00:28:58.914]  I was like, exactly.
[00:29:00.316 --> 00:29:01.677]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.677 --> 00:29:06.999]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.999 --> 00:29:08.580]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:16.944]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.944 --> 00:29:22.627]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.807 --> 00:29:24.629]  My blood pressure has normalized.

[00:32:00.797 --> 00:32:08.184]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[00:32:08.184 --> 00:32:12.468]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[00:32:12.468 --> 00:32:16.051]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[00:32:21.837 --> 00:32:23.558]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[00:32:23.558 --> 00:32:24.778]  This is racketeering.
[00:32:24.778 --> 00:32:25.898]  This is cartels.
[00:32:25.898 --> 00:32:28.299]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:30.160]  We need it now.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.881]  You can take on Big Tech.
[00:32:31.881 --> 00:32:40.824]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[00:32:40.824 --> 00:32:48.847]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[00:32:48.847 --> 00:32:49.727]  The way to fight back
[00:32:50.327 --> 00:32:55.188]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[00:32:55.188 --> 00:33:02.911]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[00:33:02.911 --> 00:33:05.551]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:24.921 --> 00:33:29.782]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:33:29.782 --> 00:33:40.706]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.706 --> 00:33:44.166]  You know, I'll tell you something, folks.
[00:33:44.166 --> 00:33:52.389]  I was coming into this segment to break down the globalist plan to bring our borders down, which is now out in the open and get to the latest developments.
[00:33:53.565 --> 00:33:53.926]  I don't
[00:34:13.143 --> 00:34:15.125]  Break and we're going to have the video next hour.
[00:34:15.125 --> 00:34:26.476]  We're going to get to this that was like a real punch in the stomach, but it's something we're going to cover and I hope everybody tweets and Facebooks and gets out there from newswars.com that that URL doesn't get censored as much.
[00:34:26.476 --> 00:34:29.098]  That's what you were you want to send the story out.
[00:34:29.098 --> 00:34:36.506]  So I'm going to this next hour, but this is the final one of the final phases and how this evil
[00:34:37.771 --> 00:34:39.132]  Unfolds.
[00:34:39.132 --> 00:34:46.697]  Like Hellraiser, little boxes, once you get one open and then it unfolds and something bad really happens.
[00:34:46.697 --> 00:34:50.240]  Well, this little portal to hell is opening up quite nicely.
[00:34:50.240 --> 00:35:05.551]  And it's, uh, quote, drag queen transvestites dressed like zombies, because that's really what this is, a celebration of zombiosis.
[00:35:06.874 --> 00:35:12.577]  With people with Down Syndrome.
[00:35:12.577 --> 00:35:23.304]  Now, I'm going to leave this to the next hour, but I want you to understand something that I learned from Senator John DeCamp, and that I learned from a congressional record and convictions.
[00:35:23.304 --> 00:35:32.770]  But Down Syndrome and other mentally disabled young people have been the favorite target
[00:35:33.789 --> 00:35:36.873]  of the pedophile rings for a very, very long time.
[00:35:36.873 --> 00:35:41.099]  And the exploitation of them is particularly nasty.
[00:35:41.099 --> 00:35:42.741]  And when he showed me this article and I read it...
[00:35:46.462 --> 00:35:55.264]  It's one of those stories that just opens up thousands of data points that makes you physically angry, but also sick to your stomach, and just with a real desire to defend your family.
[00:35:55.264 --> 00:36:12.108]  You know, when I look at my three daughters, you know, my son's 6'2", and Rex is 6'2", now, and got arms bigger than mine, but when I look at them particularly, my two-year-old daughter,
[00:36:15.296 --> 00:36:17.638]  I feel guilty.
[00:36:17.638 --> 00:36:26.703]  Because my soul and my guts tell me you need to be doing more to protect her from these people and this system and you need to get out there and you need to do something.
[00:36:26.703 --> 00:36:33.247]  Because children are so innocent and they're so good and Down Syndrome children are so sweet and so good.
[00:36:33.247 --> 00:36:35.729]  Anybody that's worked with them knows that.
[00:36:35.729 --> 00:36:41.812]  And they've had members of the Parliament come out in England, they've had educators, they're liberals but have a soul, come out and say,
[00:36:43.354 --> 00:36:47.797]  Up to a third of our kids are autistic or have mental problems.
[00:36:47.797 --> 00:36:48.637]  No one's asking why.
[00:36:48.637 --> 00:36:49.438]  It's been done on purpose.
[00:36:49.438 --> 00:36:50.438]  It's chemical and biological.
[00:36:50.438 --> 00:36:57.943]  But they say they're all being inducted when they're five, six, seven years old, being told that they're really trans.
[00:36:57.943 --> 00:37:04.167]  And so the state is getting mentally disabled children to renounce their parents and others and be emancipated.
[00:37:04.929 --> 00:37:05.849]  Now, think about that.
[00:37:05.849 --> 00:37:17.855]  They're not just emancipating a child that has their mental faculties when they're 9 or 10, like they're doing in England and the U.S., sterilizing them, because, quote, the kid got talked into it.
[00:37:17.855 --> 00:37:21.077]  That's why, you know, as an adult, you don't trick a kid to get in your car and drink whiskey.
[00:37:21.077 --> 00:37:26.459]  You're contributing to the delinquency of minors, or drugs, or whatever, or sex.
[00:37:26.459 --> 00:37:29.541]  It is because they don't have the age of consent.
[00:37:31.155 --> 00:37:38.419]  But they are getting seven-year-old Down Syndrome children to emancipate themselves.
[00:37:38.419 --> 00:37:39.359]  That's how the left works.
[00:37:39.359 --> 00:37:43.881]  Don't call them retarded, which is just the medical word.
[00:37:43.881 --> 00:37:47.903]  Just sterilize them.
[00:37:47.903 --> 00:37:54.347]  And teach them the love of 20 men running a train on them and giving them HIV.
[00:37:54.347 --> 00:37:57.268]  Just like Bayer gives you that gift as well.
[00:37:57.268 --> 00:37:59.389]  See how that works?
[00:37:59.389 --> 00:38:00.690]  To keep the babies comfortable.
[00:38:02.486 --> 00:38:03.527]  So that's coming up next hour.
[00:38:03.527 --> 00:38:05.088]  I'll get to the border stuff next segment.
[00:38:05.088 --> 00:38:11.493]  But you have to understand that I was talking to a registered nurse who was in town a few weeks ago.
[00:38:11.493 --> 00:38:13.975]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:38:13.975 --> 00:38:20.780]  Over my kitchen table.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:26.344]  And she was talking about abortion and you know, Trump trying to take women's rights away.
[00:38:28.274 --> 00:38:38.637]  And I said, you know, the issue is, is that they're keeping babies alive after they're born so that they can have their organs taken even down to being exsanguinated.
[00:38:38.637 --> 00:38:39.677]  I'll use a medical term.
[00:38:39.677 --> 00:38:40.537]  Oh, you know that term?
[00:38:40.537 --> 00:38:40.897]  Yeah.
[00:38:40.897 --> 00:38:41.577]  Blood being drained.
[00:38:41.577 --> 00:38:43.498]  That's important.
[00:38:43.498 --> 00:38:46.718]  A little, little final touch.
[00:38:46.718 --> 00:38:54.380]  Just the final vampiric seal draining them down to nothing and then harvesting the skin and everything else.
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.901]  Let's face the real horror.
[00:38:55.901 --> 00:38:57.181]  This isn't a vampire movie.
[00:38:59.875 --> 00:39:06.757]  But you go read Bram Stoker, you watch the remake of it in the 90s, Keanu Reeves and the rest of it.
[00:39:06.757 --> 00:39:09.178]  What does Dracula bring his queens?
[00:39:09.178 --> 00:39:10.818]  Little babies.
[00:39:10.818 --> 00:39:15.679]  They all get around them and drink the blood of the baby like they're eating corn on the cob.
[00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:17.600]  That's actually how it's done.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:24.362]  These people don't live forever, but they'll torture the living daylights out of your baby for days like it's corn on the cob.
[00:39:27.133 --> 00:39:30.115]  Big old chunks out of those thighs.
[00:39:30.115 --> 00:39:31.517]  Rape them.
[00:39:31.517 --> 00:39:35.260]  They like to prick them with little sticks and suck more blood.
[00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.342]  Their favorite's a two or three year old because they can hear them begging for mama.
[00:39:38.342 --> 00:39:42.626]  That's the whale song to these demons.
[00:39:42.626 --> 00:39:45.728]  They like that a lot.
[00:39:45.728 --> 00:39:48.470]  You see how it works now?
[00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:49.311]  So I'm talking to her.
[00:39:49.311 --> 00:39:50.032]  She's a nice lady.
[00:39:50.032 --> 00:39:50.512]  She means well.
[00:39:50.512 --> 00:39:56.337]  And I said, hey, I know you mainly work in Veterans Affairs there at the big hospital.
[00:39:57.264 --> 00:40:02.207]  I said, well, you know they're keeping babies alive and taking their organs and also adults.
[00:40:02.207 --> 00:40:04.769]  And she says, well, yeah, that's what you do when you're an organ donor.
[00:40:04.769 --> 00:40:08.551]  They put you in an oxygen tent, whether you're a baby or whether you're an adult.
[00:40:08.551 --> 00:40:14.735]  And, you know, while they get everything lined up for the surgery to make sure that all the organs go out to who they're needed.
[00:40:14.735 --> 00:40:17.957]  Because if you just take them all on the spot, you might not get them delivered in time.
[00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:21.139]  And I'm like, no, I know they're keeping them fresh.
[00:40:21.139 --> 00:40:22.440]  She's like, oh, wait, yeah.
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.182]  And I'm like, yeah, well, why is the baby?
[00:40:25.182 --> 00:40:26.143]  Did the baby have a choice?
[00:40:27.358 --> 00:40:36.484]  Oh, but see, it wasn't a human up to the time it's born, and then the doctor says, oh, the mama decided not to resuscitate.
[00:40:36.484 --> 00:40:40.767]  That's why partial birth is so important, because now they're keeping the babies alive.
[00:40:40.767 --> 00:40:45.229]  And she goes, yeah, I've heard about that in the oxygen tents.
[00:40:45.229 --> 00:40:47.251]  And she kind of got this weird look on her face, like, wait, that's...
[00:40:48.973 --> 00:40:55.661]  I'm like, yeah, you see, it's one thing if the guy is on their organ donor car and they're in a car wreck and they say their brain dead and so you keep them alive a couple days to get it lined up.
[00:40:55.661 --> 00:40:59.425]  You see how that kind of then stretches on out?
[00:40:59.425 --> 00:41:04.231]  And the woman's hands started shaking and she went, oh, well, let's change the subject.
[00:41:06.055 --> 00:41:11.456]  Because it wasn't pontificating anymore about how us men are taking women's rights away.
[00:41:11.456 --> 00:41:15.137]  It was the real world and what this really is.
[00:41:15.137 --> 00:41:19.438]  And anybody that signs on to it needs to understand what you're really signing on to.
[00:41:19.438 --> 00:41:28.940]  Unless you want to go to Castle Dracula, where Prince Charles lives half the year, and unless you want to torture babies to death and drink their blood, then don't sign on to this.
[00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.901]  I'm going to explain to you again.
[00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:32.970]  All the legends are true.
[00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.410]  This is where all this comes from.
[00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:38.052]  There's a worldwide cult of people that want to torture babies to death.
[00:41:38.052 --> 00:41:39.052]  Period.
[00:41:39.052 --> 00:41:42.994]  The bottom of the rat hole is torturing babies to death and sucking their blood.
[00:41:42.994 --> 00:41:47.256]  And as soon as people figure that out, you're already getting injected with their parts in your body.
[00:41:47.256 --> 00:41:50.357]  They're already making, testing the Pepsi flavoring with it.
[00:41:50.357 --> 00:41:54.999]  There's already tens of thousands of usage for human body parts.
[00:41:54.999 --> 00:41:56.540]  Of people that didn't ask to get killed.
[00:42:00.683 --> 00:42:03.204]  So, you feel safe, folks, with this kind of stuff going on?
[00:42:03.204 --> 00:42:12.069]  Because next hour, I'm going to show you women talking about how they have orgasms when they go in and have abortions, and how much they love it.
[00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:13.849]  And by the way, you think this is just a few women?
[00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:15.250]  No.
[00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:25.195]  You go to any Democratic Party event, or anywhere in the legislature where they're trying to restrict abortion, and women show up in business suits.
[00:42:26.704 --> 00:42:28.786]  Not just meth at Antifa.
[00:42:28.786 --> 00:42:31.008]  And they start licking their lips to become a demon possessed.
[00:42:31.008 --> 00:42:33.491]  They go, I love Satan, I love...
[00:42:37.702 --> 00:42:38.863]  I mean, it's all on video.
[00:42:38.863 --> 00:42:43.727]  Everywhere, you're like, well, they're... Just like a vampire.
[00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:45.328]  Because they're vampires, folks.
[00:42:45.328 --> 00:42:46.890]  There's a spirit.
[00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:48.211]  They're vampires.
[00:42:48.211 --> 00:42:55.257]  The Democratic Party is part of a worldwide paedophile vampire cult, and now their low-level members are being spiritually inducted.
[00:42:55.257 --> 00:42:58.859]  The enemy is powering up the vampire horde, just like in legend.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:01.921]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[00:44:01.201 --> 00:44:03.142]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[00:44:03.142 --> 00:44:03.962]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[00:44:03.962 --> 00:44:05.263]  You are the man, Alex.
[00:44:05.263 --> 00:44:06.844]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[00:44:06.844 --> 00:44:07.624]  I'm so excited.
[00:44:07.624 --> 00:44:08.525]  I'm such a big fan.
[00:44:08.525 --> 00:44:11.026]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[00:44:11.026 --> 00:44:13.527]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[00:44:13.527 --> 00:44:14.948]  The Bone Broth.
[00:44:14.948 --> 00:44:16.369]  The Bone Broth.
[00:44:16.369 --> 00:44:17.770]  The Bone Broth.
[00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:19.030]  The Bone Broth.
[00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:23.793]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[00:44:23.793 --> 00:44:25.093]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:44:25.093 --> 00:44:26.374]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:44:26.374 --> 00:44:27.775]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:44:28.175 --> 00:44:29.236]  Like, good!
[00:44:29.236 --> 00:44:29.856]  Whoa!
[00:44:29.856 --> 00:44:31.577]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:44:31.577 --> 00:44:35.778]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:44:35.778 --> 00:44:41.581]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for that as well.
[00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:44.142]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[00:44:44.142 --> 00:44:51.365]  I'm thanking you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[00:44:51.365 --> 00:44:52.185]  It is next level.

[00:44:53.306 --> 00:44:55.227]  I feel great since I've been taking it.

[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.721]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[00:46:07.721 --> 00:46:10.162]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[00:46:10.162 --> 00:46:11.142]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[00:46:11.142 --> 00:46:11.602]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:12.923]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:46:12.923 --> 00:46:15.004]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[00:46:15.004 --> 00:46:18.645]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[00:46:18.645 --> 00:46:20.926]  My truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[00:46:20.926 --> 00:46:22.886]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[00:46:22.886 --> 00:46:23.847]  God bless you, brother.
[00:46:23.847 --> 00:46:30.469]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[00:46:30.849 --> 00:46:31.950]  You're our only hope, brother.
[00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:34.271]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[00:46:34.271 --> 00:46:37.013]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[00:47:03.894 --> 00:47:06.516]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:39.317 --> 00:47:40.638]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:40.638 --> 00:47:43.620]  Alex Jones here, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:46.502]  The Globalists do not want you tuning into this show.
[00:47:46.502 --> 00:47:49.264]  They don't want you to incrementally see what's being done to everybody.
[00:47:49.264 --> 00:47:51.366]  How our conscience is being destroyed.
[00:47:51.366 --> 00:47:53.587]  How our families are consciously being destroyed.
[00:47:53.587 --> 00:48:02.453]  How our civilization is being imploded by design so the super-class predators can have their way with us.
[00:48:02.453 --> 00:48:03.754]  The Globalists are not pro-human.
[00:48:03.754 --> 00:48:04.615]  They're anti-human.
[00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:07.731]  They operate like H.G.
[00:48:07.731 --> 00:48:12.054]  Wells' Morlocks, and we are the Eloi.
[00:48:12.054 --> 00:48:18.298]  Now, the third world population has more than tripled in the last 50 years on this planet.
[00:48:18.298 --> 00:48:22.900]  Western populations, whether it's Japan or the United States, are going down massively.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:28.664]  We're only having about 1.3 children for every 2 adults that were born in the previous generations.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:52.236]  Unskilled populations are being brought in, they're being radicalized, they're being programmed before they even get here at the refugee camps and are being prepared to be political operatives to help bring in globalism, which is a form of communism and corporate fascism labeled socialism to control and domesticate the populations.
[00:48:52.236 --> 00:48:54.778]  But the big banks said offshore.
[00:48:54.778 --> 00:48:58.881]  So the plan going back to the North American Union and the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[00:49:00.199 --> 00:49:10.224]  Was to weaponize giant third world populations in collapsing nations that the globalists have, on record, helped collapse in their own documents.
[00:49:10.224 --> 00:49:25.251]  And then export by trains, planes, automobiles with free debit cards, money, cash, protection, clothing, medicine, food to the United States and to Europe.
[00:49:26.101 --> 00:49:34.566]  They're then brought into state-sponsored and funded refugee centers and are turned into a political weapon.
[00:49:34.566 --> 00:49:47.215]  And now we've got millions of Africans making their way here, not just millions from Latin America, because the channels have been set up by the UN and Trump is trying to stop it.
[00:49:47.215 --> 00:49:53.339]  I don't think Trump is doing enough, but every day groups of hundreds of Africans and hundreds of Middle Easterners
[00:49:54.304 --> 00:50:00.587]  are being picked up on the streets of the United States and they're having to release them.
[00:50:00.587 --> 00:50:03.969]  In many cases they can't even stop them because they don't even have beds.
[00:50:03.969 --> 00:50:04.950]  They don't even have courts.
[00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.130]  We've been overwhelmed.
[00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:08.132]  We've been broken.
[00:50:08.132 --> 00:50:17.216]  This is far beyond just a regular border crisis.
[00:50:17.216 --> 00:50:21.099]  Enter into that new government map shows 80% of Mexico's 266 districts
[00:50:24.392 --> 00:50:42.302]  are controlled by drug cartels and you look at the images in this red state article showing the latest giant incredibly huge caravans four times bigger than anything that's hit us before
[00:50:43.558 --> 00:50:45.338]  This is an invasion.
[00:50:45.338 --> 00:50:47.099]  This is a globalist plan.
[00:50:47.099 --> 00:50:53.781]  Report Mexico getting illegals, bus tickets to different places along the border to spread them out.
[00:50:53.781 --> 00:50:55.141]  News wars.
[00:50:55.141 --> 00:50:57.181]  And the Vatican is helping fund it.
[00:50:57.181 --> 00:50:59.402]  The UN is helping fund.
[00:50:59.402 --> 00:51:07.204]  And the State Department, though under quasi-control of Trump, through USAID, is also funding it.
[00:51:07.204 --> 00:51:09.344]  That's why the government is in such rebellion to Trump.
[00:51:09.344 --> 00:51:11.865]  He's trying to stop all of that.
[00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:21.518]  And again, we're getting the poorest, we're getting the most low educated, we're getting the criminals, and they admit that 30% of the children with these groups are not related to who has them.
[00:51:21.518 --> 00:51:28.123]  Children, though, are being kidnapped en masse from all over Latin America and taken as the golden ticket.
[00:51:28.123 --> 00:51:30.985]  Kidnapped children being used as the golden ticket.
[00:51:30.985 --> 00:51:32.266]  This is incredibly evil.
[00:51:32.266 --> 00:51:33.327]  This is incredibly out of control.
[00:51:33.327 --> 00:51:40.152]  Even the Senate report admits that upwards of 30% of the kids are also being trafficked into sex.
[00:51:40.152 --> 00:51:40.593]  Well, guess what?
[00:51:41.727 --> 00:51:46.209]  Welcome to the New World Order, folks, where it's moral to kidnap kids.
[00:51:46.209 --> 00:51:47.909]  Oh, and it gets worse.
[00:51:47.909 --> 00:52:00.834]  There's new video out of double amputees that smugglers, once they get crowds of people into the U.S., pass the Border Patrol saying, oh, look, we've got handicapped folks with us.
[00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:03.535]  They then throw them into the water.
[00:52:03.535 --> 00:52:05.896]  Oh, and it gets worse.
[00:52:05.896 --> 00:52:06.456]  It gets worse.
[00:52:07.622 --> 00:52:24.961]  They're finding little kids all over Texas, New Mexico, and other areas just wandering around because after they get through, and after they're not needed, they either kill them, or throw them out in the field, or sell them to brokers that pull up in vans.
[00:52:24.961 --> 00:52:27.184]  Wonder who they could be.
[00:52:27.184 --> 00:52:28.846]  This is a bloody feast.
[00:52:30.526 --> 00:52:51.504]  You ever been to the ocean when there's a red tide and the fish are all getting poisoned and going crazy and there's there's there's mackerel and all sorts of stuff in like a half foot of water shouldn't even be there and there's just crazy fish beaching themselves everywhere and there'll be hundreds of thousands of birds eating and eating eating the flesh but they go crazy too from all the toxins and they start falling out of the sky dying.
[00:52:51.504 --> 00:52:52.565]  I saw a red tide once.
[00:52:52.565 --> 00:52:55.287]  It stayed a day longer than I should have.
[00:52:55.287 --> 00:52:56.769]  But it was incredible watching it.
[00:52:56.769 --> 00:52:58.210]  I got sick from it just breathing it in.
[00:52:59.616 --> 00:53:06.079]  That was down in South Texas.
[00:53:06.079 --> 00:53:08.800]  In South Padre.
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.781]  So you see, smugglers throw paraplegic.
[00:53:12.781 --> 00:53:14.302]  What's a paraplegic?
[00:53:14.302 --> 00:53:18.784]  They're paralyzed, what, chest down?
[00:53:18.784 --> 00:53:21.185]  Or is it stomach down?
[00:53:21.185 --> 00:53:22.225]  Legs down.
[00:53:22.225 --> 00:53:23.186]  That's right.
[00:53:23.186 --> 00:53:26.287]  Paraplegic's legs down, but quadriplegic's from the neck down, right?
[00:53:27.734 --> 00:53:32.799]  So a person's paralyzed, and the smugglers throw them into the water.
[00:53:32.799 --> 00:53:40.406]  But see, Robert Rodriguez isn't going to make a movie about Hispanics killing 99% of Hispanics.
[00:53:40.406 --> 00:53:47.332]  They're going to show Don Johnson blowing Mexican women away, shooting them in the stomach when they're pregnant.
[00:53:47.332 --> 00:53:50.035]  But it's actually the Democratic Party that wants to kill those babies.
[00:53:50.035 --> 00:53:51.036]  But see, it doesn't matter.
[00:53:51.036 --> 00:53:52.297]  Robert Rodriguez.
[00:53:53.393 --> 00:53:55.874]  He's a Hispanic supremacist, but he's not really.
[00:53:55.874 --> 00:53:59.256]  No, he's funded by the Ford Foundation.
[00:53:59.256 --> 00:54:03.118]  He's funded by the federal government to sow the seeds of evil.
[00:54:03.118 --> 00:54:14.963]  He won't make a movie about the coyotes that he glorifies throwing people paralyzed into the water to die because he's Robert Rodriguez.
[00:54:14.963 --> 00:54:16.384]  And it's good to be evil, isn't it?
[00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.505]  Smugglers throw paraplegic double amputee migrants into Rio Grande.
[00:54:21.505 --> 00:54:24.209]  Border agents forced to save newswars.com.
[00:54:24.209 --> 00:54:32.840]  Those dirty American border agents that are getting typhus and TB and are saying we should at least test people for diseases and...
[00:54:33.783 --> 00:54:36.044]  The Democrats say no, no funding for that.
[00:54:36.044 --> 00:54:36.784]  Let them in.
[00:54:36.784 --> 00:54:38.004]  It's humanitarian.
[00:54:38.004 --> 00:54:39.265]  Let them into your schools.
[00:54:39.265 --> 00:54:41.005]  Let them give you the diseases.
[00:54:41.005 --> 00:54:45.607]  Let them, let them, let them have dinner with rats in San Francisco.
[00:54:45.607 --> 00:54:48.307]  Make it chic that there's rats and feces and needles everywhere.
[00:54:48.307 --> 00:54:50.328]  Have a dungeon with rescue rats.
[00:54:50.328 --> 00:54:51.668]  No, it's not a new Disney movie.
[00:54:51.668 --> 00:54:56.130]  It's rescue rats at the table with you with little rat turds.
[00:54:56.130 --> 00:55:02.772]  Let's play a clip of folks in the Midwest freaking out on San Francisco where they're celebrating the disease.
[00:55:02.772 --> 00:55:03.212]  Here it is.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:11.068]  A tourist hotspot in San Francisco is offering a new way to experience the city's, quote, weird, twisted, and dark history.
[00:55:11.068 --> 00:55:12.730]  It's called the Rat's Bar.
[00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:13.651]  It's a pop-up bar.
[00:55:13.651 --> 00:55:21.701]  It's offering a 60-minute journey into a dark place where rats run free and the booze flows like water.
[00:55:21.701 --> 00:55:22.302]  That's a quote.
[00:55:22.302 --> 00:55:23.463]  That's a direct quote, by the way.
[00:55:24.663 --> 00:55:32.490]  Ticket purchase includes one Amarillo sour with a rat tail garnish.
[00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:32.930]  No.
[00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:38.755]  And then taking on a tour to learn more about the gold rush, Alcatraz and the plague.
[00:55:38.755 --> 00:55:45.881]  The live rats are all being brought in by an animal rescue group.
[00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:47.202]  Why do we need the rats?
[00:55:49.244 --> 00:55:50.404]  Did I miss that?
[00:55:50.404 --> 00:55:51.765]  Why do we need the rats?
[00:55:51.765 --> 00:55:55.426]  Listen, there are plenty of other bars you can go to in that area if you're not a fan of this one.
[00:55:55.426 --> 00:55:55.926]  Hey, stop right there.
[00:55:55.926 --> 00:55:56.206]  That's right.
[00:55:56.206 --> 00:55:58.007]  It's all about freedom, isn't it?
[00:55:58.007 --> 00:56:03.549]  And remember what happened when the convicted pedophiles were running the storybook time for little kids in Houston?
[00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:07.110]  And the local news said, gotta get them while they're young.
[00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:13.872]  Imagine 20 years ago, a Hollywood movie about 2019, and there's convicted pedophiles with your children.
[00:56:15.532 --> 00:56:17.452]  Some of them convicted murderers.
[00:56:17.452 --> 00:56:19.493]  These are child rapists.
[00:56:19.493 --> 00:56:22.134]  And the news goes, gotta get them while they're young.
[00:56:22.134 --> 00:56:39.218]  And they go, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,
[00:56:40.567 --> 00:56:44.530]  I have all these former Democrats and DHS people saying, oh, there's no caravan, there's no crisis.
[00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:46.551]  Now they say there is one, but it's all Trump's fault.
[00:56:46.551 --> 00:56:49.593]  We'll play those clips, briefly, in one minute.
[00:56:49.593 --> 00:56:51.355]  We have a new super special.
[00:56:51.355 --> 00:56:53.916]  It's on everything with force in its name.
[00:56:53.916 --> 00:57:01.582]  The new, already best-selling, Space Force, America's Back, awesome shirt that I love and everybody else is loving.
[00:57:01.582 --> 00:57:02.482]  It's going to be a hit shirt now.
[00:57:02.482 --> 00:57:03.783]  I hope you get it.
[00:57:03.783 --> 00:57:05.024]  Supports the broadcast, spreads the word.
[00:57:05.024 --> 00:57:06.105]  It's a great conversation piece.
[00:57:07.324 --> 00:57:10.266]  It's 33% off all the other Force products.
[00:57:10.266 --> 00:57:12.847]  DNA Force Plus, that is such a huge deal.
[00:57:12.847 --> 00:57:16.029]  That is the best CoQ10 PQQ system.
[00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:18.291]  Just unbelievable what it does, folks.
[00:57:18.291 --> 00:57:19.091]  50% off.
[00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:20.832]  Nobody gets close to that price.
[00:57:20.832 --> 00:57:22.513]  Rain Force Plus, amazing.
[00:57:22.513 --> 00:57:27.656]  Turbo Force, which is just 10-hour energy, clean, healthy, focused, amazing.
[00:57:27.656 --> 00:57:29.838]  Ultimate Female Force is incredible as well.
[00:57:29.838 --> 00:57:31.559]  It's 33% off, so we're about to sell out of that.
[00:57:32.299 --> 00:57:34.102]  All of the Force products.
[00:57:34.102 --> 00:57:35.804]  It's got Force in the name.
[00:57:35.804 --> 00:57:41.051]  It's 50 to 30% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:43.574]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:43.574 --> 00:57:46.498]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:57:49.713 --> 00:58:00.779]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[00:58:00.779 --> 00:58:09.644]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[00:58:09.644 --> 00:58:13.647]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[00:58:14.327 --> 00:58:20.795]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[00:58:20.795 --> 00:58:22.977]  And you may be experiencing backup too.

[00:59:53.301 --> 00:59:55.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:23.795 --> 01:00:27.838]  So, evil is coming out of the closet.
[01:00:27.838 --> 01:00:33.181]  And just like every other culture told us throughout history, there are cycles in humankind.
[01:00:33.181 --> 01:00:39.425]  People become decadent, corruption grows, and people come for your children.
[01:00:39.425 --> 01:00:40.506]  People come for your sovereignty.
[01:00:40.506 --> 01:00:45.429]  They come for everything you've got because it's a raw exercise of power.
[01:00:47.822 --> 01:00:50.803]  So, evil's on the move, but so is the force of good.
[01:00:50.803 --> 01:00:53.684]  And those of us promoting a pro-human future.
[01:00:53.684 --> 01:01:04.107]  Now, you've got one of the former heads of the Border Patrol, Commissioner Kowalski.
[01:01:04.107 --> 01:01:07.809]  This is him, months ago, saying there is no border crisis.
[01:01:07.809 --> 01:01:08.629]  Trump's made it up.
[01:01:08.629 --> 01:01:11.470]  Now he says there is a border crisis, and it's Trump's fault.
[01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.770]  Here it is.
[01:01:14.466 --> 01:01:16.369]  This is Weekend Edition from NPR News.
[01:01:16.369 --> 01:01:17.290]  I'm Scott Simon.
[01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:22.556]  Here's how President Trump explains why he's decided to declare a national emergency on the border with Mexico.
[01:01:22.556 --> 01:01:24.197]  It's very simple.
[01:01:24.197 --> 01:01:28.022]  We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.
[01:01:28.022 --> 01:01:30.925]  We want to stop criminals and gangs.
[01:01:32.031 --> 01:01:33.532]  from coming into our country.
[01:01:33.532 --> 01:01:35.734]  Nobody's done the job that we've ever done.
[01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:37.956]  I mean, nobody's done the job that we've done on the border.
[01:01:37.956 --> 01:01:39.777]  That's from the Rose Garden yesterday.
[01:01:39.777 --> 01:01:42.779]  Let's turn now to somebody who used to oversee that border.
[01:01:42.779 --> 01:01:44.841]  Gil Krulikowski was the Commissioner of U.S.
[01:01:44.841 --> 01:01:47.723]  Customs and Border Protection during the Obama Administration.
[01:01:47.723 --> 01:01:52.407]  Before that, he was Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
[01:01:52.407 --> 01:01:54.408]  He was Chief of Police of Seattle.
[01:01:54.408 --> 01:01:55.889]  He joins us on the line now.
[01:01:55.889 --> 01:01:57.751]  Thanks very much for being with us.
[01:01:57.751 --> 01:01:58.151]  Of course.
[01:01:59.452 --> 01:02:01.974]  Mr. Kerlikowske, do you think there's an emergency?
[01:02:01.974 --> 01:02:04.996]  Criminals and gangs coming in at the southern border?
[01:02:04.996 --> 01:02:05.817]  No, I don't.
[01:02:05.817 --> 01:02:10.580]  There's only a manufactured crisis by this president.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:15.484]  Okay, well that's, that's... Bull hockey, as it's known.
[01:02:15.484 --> 01:02:16.724]  It's Bravo Sierra.
[01:02:16.724 --> 01:02:19.767]  So here he is now, just a few days ago, he's changing his tune.
[01:02:19.767 --> 01:02:20.087]  Here it is.
[01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:23.144]  So, I understand what you're saying.
[01:02:23.144 --> 01:02:33.547]  A number of these are Central American migrants coming through Mexico, but this is the President saying, Mexico, you need to do more as an intermediary here in the middle to stop them from crossing over into the United States.
[01:02:33.547 --> 01:02:37.047]  That's what he's asking for and that's why he's threatening these tariffs.
[01:02:37.047 --> 01:02:43.529]  I will note, and you know these numbers, this week, just on Wednesday, CBP stopped a group of a thousand
[01:02:44.329 --> 01:02:45.289]  Migrants.
[01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:48.511]  That was the biggest group that they have apprehended thus far altogether.
[01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:50.552]  Many of them were families.
[01:02:50.552 --> 01:02:52.572]  So there is a problem, right?
[01:02:52.572 --> 01:02:55.073]  This is video of it that the president tweeted.
[01:02:55.073 --> 01:02:57.334]  So what would you do about it?
[01:02:57.334 --> 01:03:06.158]  So this is a crisis and for anyone on either side of the policy aisle that said it's not a crisis, these numbers are a crisis and the workload is tremendous.
[01:03:08.183 --> 01:03:10.804]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:10.804 --> 01:03:12.184]  That's how these guys operate.
[01:03:12.184 --> 01:03:15.325]  That's how stupid they think you are.
[01:03:15.325 --> 01:03:18.506]  There were giant caravans hitting us last year and this year.
[01:03:18.506 --> 01:03:21.246]  And they go on TV and say, there is no caravan.
[01:03:21.246 --> 01:03:24.807]  Jim Acosta went down to the Texas border and said, look, there's nobody here.
[01:03:24.807 --> 01:03:28.828]  He was standing behind a section of wall, 30 feet tall.
[01:03:28.828 --> 01:03:30.009]  They're like, well, he got discredited.
[01:03:30.009 --> 01:03:31.309]  Well, here's the difference.
[01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:34.310]  There are a lot of people that still tune into that and believe it.
[01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:35.070]  But it's bigger than that.
[01:03:36.471 --> 01:03:43.032]  Lying like that is a psychological warfare tactic to, again, break your will.
[01:03:43.032 --> 01:03:45.973]  That's what they do.
[01:03:45.973 --> 01:03:53.895]  And it's getting harder and harder and harder for them to cover up the reality of what's happening.
[01:03:53.895 --> 01:04:03.237]  But, again, now that they have to admit that it's unfolding, they're saying that it's President Trump's fault.
[01:04:03.237 --> 01:04:04.557]  This is an organized UN
[01:04:07.262 --> 01:04:14.048]  Replacement of Population Migration in the Official UN Plans.
[01:04:14.048 --> 01:04:15.430]  The Official UN Plans from 1991 and 2002.
[01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:16.291]  You can go to m4wars.com.
[01:04:22.386 --> 01:04:24.848]  Just type into the search engine, the U.N.
[01:04:24.848 --> 01:04:27.731]  wants 600 million migrants in the U.S.
[01:04:27.731 --> 01:04:29.172]  by 2050.
[01:04:29.172 --> 01:04:30.613]  Snopes says we're lying.
[01:04:30.613 --> 01:04:31.994]  They say, well, it's an actual U.N.
[01:04:31.994 --> 01:04:33.195]  document, but the U.N.
[01:04:33.195 --> 01:04:34.717]  doesn't mean it.
[01:04:34.717 --> 01:04:35.177]  Wow!
[01:04:35.177 --> 01:04:36.618]  Talk about mental gymnastics.
[01:04:36.618 --> 01:04:41.202]  And of course, you saw Macron say they want 250 million more people in France.
[01:04:42.335 --> 01:04:43.977]  That's official!
[01:04:43.977 --> 01:04:47.760]  UN calls for 600 million migrants to invade the U.S.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:52.544]  But again, Snopes says, well, they actually said that, but they didn't mean it.
[01:04:52.544 --> 01:04:55.007]  So Paul Watson and Alex Jones are liars!
[01:04:58.234 --> 01:04:59.575]  It's time.
[01:04:59.575 --> 01:05:02.597]  It's time to start your summer with real power.
[01:05:02.597 --> 01:05:05.159]  The power that God gave us through Mother Nature.

[01:06:05.564 --> 01:06:14.033]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:26.127 --> 01:06:36.632]  Alright, this is going to be hard for me to cover, but the children and the innocents demand that we do it.
[01:06:36.632 --> 01:06:41.075]  And I'm not being dramatic when I say that.
[01:06:41.075 --> 01:06:55.502]  I've got a stack here of seven or eight videos and of ten articles with the most evil stuff you've ever heard of or ever seen that's happened to our children.
[01:06:57.557 --> 01:06:59.357]  I'll just be honest with you.
[01:06:59.357 --> 01:07:10.299]  I've been getting ready to cover this for about an hour during the breaks and I'm not being dramatic.
[01:07:10.299 --> 01:07:11.699]  I actually can't cover this right now.
[01:07:11.699 --> 01:07:12.540]  I just can't do it.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:19.121]  And I'm being honest with the audience, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:19.121 --> 01:07:24.041]  I understand why people don't get involved.
[01:07:24.041 --> 01:07:26.342]  I understand why people just want to go hide out in the countryside.
[01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:26.662]  I get it.
[01:07:27.759 --> 01:07:32.160]  And I've been doing this 25 years, and I definitely need some time off myself.
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:32.660]  But you know what?
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:37.902]  These kids that are being abused and killed, they don't have that luxury.
[01:07:37.902 --> 01:07:50.266]  And you know, when I look at this and I realize that it's worse than I can explain to people, I mean, I'm saying the most insane stuff last hour.
[01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:50.706]  It's all true.
[01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:07.555]  At a certain point, it's just not normal to sit up here on air and even talk about this stuff.
[01:08:07.555 --> 01:08:23.418]  It needs to be talked about, it needs to be dealt with, but there's a paradox where physical action, even if it's not violent, to defend these children, is organically needed at a cellular level.
[01:08:23.418 --> 01:08:30.240]  I mean, that's really what it is, is that when I cover all this, my cells and my spirit, but my flesh as well,
[01:08:35.791 --> 01:08:42.338]  is telling me that talk's cheap.
[01:08:42.338 --> 01:08:43.759]  And listen, I know talk's not cheap.
[01:08:43.759 --> 01:08:45.361]  Talk's important to get the word out.
[01:08:45.361 --> 01:08:54.911]  But the bottom line is, ladies and gentlemen, that we have been a blessed country and we are becoming a cursed nation.
[01:08:56.638 --> 01:08:58.159]  You can say what you want about Trump.
[01:08:58.159 --> 01:09:19.811]  He's just a signpost of how dire the situations are and the fact that we need to ourselves individually really get aggressive with lawsuits and with city council visits and with pickets and with undercover private work.
[01:09:21.397 --> 01:09:42.591]  I mean I never had any police training or anything and any spy training and I snuck in Bohemian Grove and I snuck in and confronted the Telecommunications Commission and used a police tactic to get them to admit they stole a bunch of money because I wanted to stop them from doing that and they sent people to prison and I'm not bragging but I'm just telling you the average person knows how to take these people on.
[01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:46.033]  You've already got all the hardware and all the gear you need to do it.
[01:09:46.033 --> 01:09:49.976]  God put it in you and we just need
[01:09:53.066 --> 01:09:56.609]  People to stop being dramatic in how they imagine all this and just to do it.
[01:09:56.609 --> 01:10:04.175]  I mean, these children need to be saved.
[01:10:04.175 --> 01:10:09.560]  And I can't sit here and teach a class on how to take down the globalists here on air, but here's one example.
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:19.268]  If you're a good-looking woman, you could go into any city or any county, you go around any Democrats, they're going to be pedophiles, drug addicts, devil-worshippers, or a mix of it.
[01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:22.986]  How do you think Veritas gets all this incredible footage?
[01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:30.234]  All you gotta do is go have drinks with these people and you can record them and all their crimes and you just put it out.
[01:10:30.234 --> 01:10:33.377]  They can't stop you.
[01:10:33.377 --> 01:10:34.418]  They're all crooks.
[01:10:34.418 --> 01:10:35.419]  You understand this.
[01:10:35.419 --> 01:10:39.323]  But I can't do it all and I'm not bitching or complaining at you.
[01:10:39.323 --> 01:10:40.985]  I'm just saying when you realize that
[01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:50.821]  You ever wonder why, like, every Project Veritas video is someone saying, yeah, we cover up the kids getting raped in the elementary school.
[01:10:50.821 --> 01:10:51.621]  We like doing that.
[01:10:51.621 --> 01:10:53.602]  Or, yeah, we got illegal aliens voting.
[01:10:53.602 --> 01:10:54.762]  We hate America.
[01:10:54.762 --> 01:10:56.543]  You're like, these are like caricatures.
[01:10:56.543 --> 01:11:03.105]  These people hate the country so much because they're evil.
[01:11:03.105 --> 01:11:07.506]  People walk up to me every day on the street when I'm out and they go, I'm so sorry you got banned and you're being demonized.
[01:11:07.506 --> 01:11:09.546]  We know you're a good person.
[01:11:09.546 --> 01:11:10.607]  We're so sorry for you.
[01:11:10.607 --> 01:11:11.307]  How are you taking it?
[01:11:13.851 --> 01:11:16.933]  And I'm like, uh, I don't care about me.
[01:11:16.933 --> 01:11:19.494]  And that's not like some unselfish statement.
[01:11:19.494 --> 01:11:21.275]  I did this to fight the globalists.
[01:11:21.275 --> 01:11:27.318]  The reason I'm talking about this is people get it through their heads.
[01:11:27.318 --> 01:11:30.960]  I'm not doing this to get the biggest show in the world.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.982]  I'm not doing this so I get a bigger house or a nicer suit.
[01:11:33.982 --> 01:11:39.365]  There's nothing wrong with money, but I won't sell my morals out for it.
[01:11:39.365 --> 01:11:41.426]  Money is nothing but a fuel, a tool.
[01:11:42.503 --> 01:11:48.266]  But people still think at a basis of they think it's how it's doing for an individual.
[01:11:48.266 --> 01:11:57.170]  Well, I'm an individualist, but I'm also a collectivist in that as an individual, I understand that what I sacrifice goes into a better world and a greater system.
[01:11:57.170 --> 01:12:00.812]  And that it's that lack of sacrifice has gotten us to this point.
[01:12:00.812 --> 01:12:04.574]  So I'm not going to tell people what I think they ought to do.
[01:12:04.574 --> 01:12:08.976]  Nothing violent.
[01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:12.118]  But if you simply go to any drag queen story time,
[01:12:14.338 --> 01:12:19.301]  And write down the license plates, and then go to an accredited private investigation system.
[01:12:19.301 --> 01:12:24.365]  They can legally and lawfully run the plates, and you're going to find upwards of half of them are convicted child rapists.
[01:12:24.365 --> 01:12:25.986]  Then you just publish that.
[01:12:25.986 --> 01:12:30.649]  That's one group you can target right now, and protect children from pedophiles.
[01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:32.250]  The government isn't going to do it.
[01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:42.896]  There's all these rich oil people I've grown up around and known, and all these, it's always about their helicopter, what they're going to do on vacation, or this fun thing they did.
[01:12:43.817 --> 01:12:56.046]  And you got all this money, and you're gonna lose every damn bit of it.
[01:12:56.046 --> 01:12:59.628]  Because you didn't spend some of it protecting people.
[01:12:59.628 --> 01:13:08.935]  If children are under attack, and children are being killed after they're born, and old people are being euthanized, and we're bringing in millions of people without even giving them tests for diseases and treatment,
[01:13:09.992 --> 01:13:11.012]  None of us are safe.
[01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:16.055]  It's a breakdown of civilization by design.
[01:13:16.055 --> 01:13:17.995]  And I know the audience gets this.
[01:13:17.995 --> 01:13:23.938]  I'm just telling folks that we need real moral outrage.
[01:13:23.938 --> 01:13:38.084]  Every one of you, go sign up for three minutes of citizens communications at your county commissioners or your selectmen or your city council, whether you're in Europe or here or anywhere else, and go get in their face about this.
[01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.020]  The truth is evident everywhere.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:48.224]  And all I'm saying is we have to get people in the streets.
[01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:55.350]  That doesn't mean leftists dressing up like clowns and having a naked baby Trump thing.
[01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:57.472]  They're just fantasizing about having sex with it, seriously.
[01:13:57.472 --> 01:14:00.875]  They're obsessed with children, killing them, raping them, it's their religion.
[01:14:02.841 --> 01:14:15.767]  But actually going into local newscasts, going to sporting events, going up on highways and doing banner hangs, which I know losers are doing, we're going to play some of those latest events next hour, I promise.
[01:14:15.767 --> 01:14:22.290]  It's just that I could sit here and cover all this news all day long, but man, and I'm going to cover when we come back.
[01:14:22.290 --> 01:14:25.172]  It's got to be done.
[01:14:25.172 --> 01:14:29.274]  Speaking of got to be done, we can hold out against the enemy and all their onslaughts for a long time.
[01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:31.525]  Thanks to you.
[01:14:31.525 --> 01:14:32.986]  The cavalry is coming.
[01:14:32.986 --> 01:14:34.607]  Trump's already signed an executive order.
[01:14:34.607 --> 01:14:36.349]  Lawsuits are being filed by everybody.
[01:14:36.349 --> 01:14:37.830]  But the university's banning free speech.
[01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:39.511]  They're already having to back off.
[01:14:39.511 --> 01:14:41.513]  Big victory there.
[01:14:41.513 --> 01:14:50.760]  We've got big victory with the moves now to prepare the antitrust suits against big tech and a lot more for their censorship and criminal activity.
[01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.802]  There's so much more happening.
[01:14:52.802 --> 01:14:57.325]  But Infowars obviously is going to stay in the fight as long as you decide we're going to stay in the fight.
[01:14:57.325 --> 01:14:59.607]  And as long as God, more importantly, decides we're going to stay in the fight.
[01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:09.429]  And so I salute and thank every single listener of this broadcast, and I thank you for spreading the word and circumnavigating the censors.
[01:15:09.429 --> 01:15:13.451]  You and your word of mouth is king.
[01:15:13.451 --> 01:15:14.332]  You're not beside me.
[01:15:14.332 --> 01:15:15.232]  You're in front of me.
[01:15:15.232 --> 01:15:17.494]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:15:17.494 --> 01:15:21.276]  We're just a focal point, willing to stick our head up.
[01:15:21.276 --> 01:15:24.638]  But the submarine's got to come up to fire torpedoes.
[01:15:24.638 --> 01:15:26.939]  So I'm proud to do that, and so is this crew.
[01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:27.780]  And yes, financially.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.361]  We have the new Super Force Special.
[01:15:31.361 --> 01:15:35.043]  Everything with Force in its name from the new Space Force T-shirt that's so popular.

[01:15:36.564 --> 01:15:40.125]  Rain Force Plus.

[01:15:42.866 --> 01:15:44.907]  It's all 50% off.
[01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:47.148]  The T-shirt's 33% off.
[01:15:47.148 --> 01:15:49.830]  If we sold the T-shirt at 50% off, that'd be a cost.
[01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:51.871]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:15:51.871 --> 01:15:53.611]  The Total Super Force Special.
[01:15:53.611 --> 01:15:54.552]  Funds the info ware.
[01:15:57.628 --> 01:15:59.590]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:04.895]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:16:04.895 --> 01:16:06.497]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:16:06.497 --> 01:16:14.845]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:17:01.288 --> 01:17:03.369]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:05.091]  I had a problem like you once.
[01:17:05.091 --> 01:17:11.656]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[01:17:11.656 --> 01:17:16.740]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:02.285]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[01:18:02.285 --> 01:18:03.346]  They are technocrats.
[01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:05.648]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[01:18:05.648 --> 01:18:12.996]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:18:12.996 --> 01:18:14.879]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[01:18:14.879 --> 01:18:17.361]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:18:17.361 --> 01:18:19.444]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect

[01:20:01.284 --> 01:20:03.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:29.907 --> 01:20:43.176]  Alright, you can't swing a stick in a blue city or a blue state where there aren't billboards and people all over TV and radio saying, I love abortions, they're sexy, they feel good, kill your baby.
[01:20:43.176 --> 01:20:46.458]  They teach in mainline textbooks from Europe to the U.S.
[01:20:46.458 --> 01:20:53.202]  that babies are parasites, horrible creatures that must be dealt with and dealt with severely.
[01:20:53.202 --> 01:20:56.765]  And they've got news sites with women talking about the sexual pleasure.
[01:20:57.890 --> 01:21:04.115]  Of killing that baby and having it scooped out of their womb and the orgasms they have.
[01:21:04.115 --> 01:21:05.116]  And fetishizing it.
[01:21:05.116 --> 01:21:07.057]  Now, none of that's true.
[01:21:07.057 --> 01:21:08.238]  It's all pure evil.
[01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:09.239]  It's super bad for you.
[01:21:09.239 --> 01:21:10.420]  It hurts like hell.
[01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:12.822]  You're killing a baby.
[01:21:12.822 --> 01:21:14.403]  But this is what they do.
[01:21:14.403 --> 01:21:22.149]  And PBS, you know, has a new video out where the woman goes to kill her twins like she's taking a dump.
[01:21:24.298 --> 01:21:26.879]  And again, it's this dehumanization.
[01:21:26.879 --> 01:21:29.321]  It's using babies in medical experiments.
[01:21:29.321 --> 01:21:31.402]  It's keeping them alive to take their organs.
[01:21:31.402 --> 01:21:33.183]  It's euthanizing old people.
[01:21:33.183 --> 01:21:35.364]  This is this incredible culture of evil.
[01:21:35.364 --> 01:21:38.786]  But there's good news that just broke as we were covering all this.
[01:21:38.786 --> 01:21:40.147]  New York Post.
[01:21:40.147 --> 01:21:43.829]  Trump administration bans medical research using fetal tissue.
[01:21:43.829 --> 01:21:44.409]  Praise God.
[01:21:44.409 --> 01:21:51.373]  Trump administration is ending medical research by government scientists using fetal tissue.
[01:21:51.373 --> 01:21:52.354]  A victory for abortion.
[01:21:53.487 --> 01:22:05.414]  Foes and a setback for researchers who use the tissue while trying to find cures for diseases such as HIV and childhood cancers that are exploding as we become so evil.
[01:22:05.414 --> 01:22:07.335]  Talk about in your face.
[01:22:07.335 --> 01:22:12.498]  So they're trying to spin that, but that is the good news on that front.
[01:22:12.498 --> 01:22:21.064]  So when I saw that PBS piece that we'll get to next segment, it made me remember Star of YouTube Abortion is really a video
[01:22:22.279 --> 01:22:26.283]  Horror movie actress Emily Letts.
[01:22:26.283 --> 01:22:37.455]  Again, this is just one of many women with their rising star, like Gloria Steinem of the CIA, when she funded Miss Magazine with the CIA, to break up the family in their own admission.
[01:22:37.455 --> 01:22:40.698]  She tells you not to have kids, but she's got four.
[01:22:40.698 --> 01:22:44.162]  Just like Ted Turner says don't have kids, but he's got five.
[01:22:45.595 --> 01:22:49.737]  Woman celebrates her cool abortion on YouTube.
[01:22:49.737 --> 01:22:51.698]  There's another woman celebrating it.
[01:22:51.698 --> 01:22:57.602]  Can we stop the pretending like abortions don't feel good?
[01:22:57.602 --> 01:22:59.363]  Ugh.
[01:22:59.363 --> 01:23:03.405]  You talk about evil, but this is all just a big lie.
[01:23:03.405 --> 01:23:04.405]  I come really hard.
[01:23:04.405 --> 01:23:09.608]  Viewer, unless you're discretion advised, you need to hear this demon talk.
[01:23:09.608 --> 01:23:13.931]  Let me do it in a Linda Blair voice because I did it in a sexy voice yesterday.
[01:23:14.918 --> 01:23:19.163]  I cum really hard when I get an abortion.
[01:23:19.163 --> 01:23:21.846]  And it's not just because I'm killing a baby.
[01:23:21.846 --> 01:23:30.335]  There's actually nerve centers in the back of the uterus that can't be stimulated through regular endocrine.
[01:23:30.335 --> 01:23:34.780]  The only way to achieve that kind of orgasm is to visit a clinic.
[01:23:35.821 --> 01:23:43.783]  And have my vagina speculated and scooped out like the bottom of a Ben & Jerry's pint of me night.
[01:23:43.783 --> 01:23:46.983]  It's dangerous, but liberating.
[01:23:46.983 --> 01:23:57.205]  Unless the adrenaline rush from bass jumping on a Snapchatting nudes to a coworker.
[01:23:57.205 --> 01:24:00.846]  Now if you go back if you want me the demon to translate that for you.
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.161]  It's like Ben and Jerry's pint of me night.
[01:24:06.161 --> 01:24:09.502]  It's all about me when I kill that baby.
[01:24:09.502 --> 01:24:11.943]  It's all about my power.
[01:24:11.943 --> 01:24:14.224]  It's all about serving my master.
[01:24:14.224 --> 01:24:21.306]  And of course, there's the nice lie that feels good so it becomes a sick fetish.
[01:24:21.306 --> 01:24:30.629]  This is like the Bible talks about they run around, they run around, evil men run around continually inventing new evils.
[01:24:31.676 --> 01:24:32.357]  I forget the verse.
[01:24:32.357 --> 01:24:36.340]  We got to pull up Bible verse about inventing new evils.
[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:41.224]  See, in the archetype of Adam and Eve, they had the knowledge of being good and being bad.
[01:24:41.224 --> 01:24:44.306]  They didn't have the knowledge of evil.
[01:24:44.306 --> 01:24:51.152]  Had the knowledge of good, common sense, but not the knowledge of the virus of evil.
[01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:56.316]  Inventing, having articles out going, it's so liberating to kill your baby.
[01:24:56.316 --> 01:24:59.979]  Okay, it is okay, it is a baby and your mother's in hell.
[01:25:02.307 --> 01:25:05.568]  And so it's like coming out and saying, let's tell them it feels good.
[01:25:05.568 --> 01:25:06.269]  Yeah.
[01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:10.630]  Don't tell them it doubles your chances of cervical or uterine or ovarian cancer.
[01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:13.231]  Every abortion you have in those organs.
[01:25:13.231 --> 01:25:16.452]  Don't tell them it's fun.
[01:25:16.452 --> 01:25:18.113]  It's fun.
[01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:22.415]  Climb into a wood chipper too when you're a little boy and flip the switch.
[01:25:22.415 --> 01:25:25.096]  Wood chippers feel good.
[01:25:25.096 --> 01:25:27.757]  It's fun to cut your fingers off with a hatchet.
[01:25:28.337 --> 01:25:31.239]  But what's really fun is to drink Drano.
[01:25:31.239 --> 01:25:35.781]  Of course, it's gonna kill ya, but I'm not gonna tell ya.
[01:25:35.781 --> 01:25:37.142]  I'm a liberal.
[01:25:37.142 --> 01:25:38.803]  I'm here to liberate.
[01:25:38.803 --> 01:25:39.923]  Forget intercourse.
[01:25:39.923 --> 01:25:41.724]  It creates a new human life.
[01:25:41.724 --> 01:25:42.605]  No!
[01:25:42.605 --> 01:25:49.288]  The intercourse we have with doctors and medical instruments and knives, chopping up babies.
[01:25:49.288 --> 01:25:55.712]  That's what makes... See, the riddle is, it's not the woman having the orgasm, it's the little demon.
[01:25:57.571 --> 01:26:02.014]  Now see, I stylized that with a little classical demon voice for ya.
[01:26:02.014 --> 01:26:06.116]  And by the way, you get around these people, they'll go, Mr. Jones, you're gonna beat us!
[01:26:06.116 --> 01:26:06.617]  Apologize!
[01:26:06.617 --> 01:26:07.097]  You're like, whoa!
[01:26:07.097 --> 01:26:12.921]  You're like, oh yeah, well you've seen all the videos we've played.
[01:26:12.921 --> 01:26:14.061]  It's real, folks.
[01:26:14.061 --> 01:26:14.762]  It's evil.
[01:26:14.762 --> 01:26:16.563]  They're demons.
[01:26:16.563 --> 01:26:18.644]  Space junk.
[01:26:18.644 --> 01:26:21.166]  Bat biters, haters of God.
[01:26:21.166 --> 01:26:24.048]  Despiteful, proud boasters.
[01:26:24.048 --> 01:26:25.849]  Inventors of evil things.
[01:26:27.079 --> 01:26:29.541]  Disobedient to parents.
[01:26:29.541 --> 01:26:30.502]  King James Version.
[01:26:30.502 --> 01:26:37.527]  Romans 1.30.
[01:26:37.527 --> 01:26:39.608]  So, I haven't even scratched the surface on all these.
[01:26:39.608 --> 01:26:50.276]  I haven't gotten... I haven't gotten to the video clips yet.
[01:26:50.276 --> 01:26:50.977]  Isn't that cute?
[01:26:54.502 --> 01:26:58.643]  Woman who videotaped her abortion admits she wasn't using birth control.
[01:26:58.643 --> 01:27:00.303]  And she did it because it's so cool.
[01:27:00.303 --> 01:27:13.086]  Miley Cyrus has new photos of her simulating oral sex with a woman, likening it to an abortion and the sexual pleasure therein.
[01:27:13.086 --> 01:27:20.027]  Miley Cyrus, I predict, will die excruciating death of cancer over two years.
[01:27:20.027 --> 01:27:21.968]  And sooner rather than later.
[01:27:21.968 --> 01:27:24.108]  I bet Miley Cyrus is dead in ten years.
[01:27:27.236 --> 01:27:29.721]  And it's going to be very, very painful.
[01:27:29.721 --> 01:27:31.224]  I feel sorry for her.
[01:27:31.224 --> 01:27:32.887]  But that's just the way God works.
[01:27:32.887 --> 01:27:34.931]  Justice must be delivered.
[01:27:34.931 --> 01:27:37.075]  Now, we're going to go to break.
[01:27:37.075 --> 01:27:37.957]  And when we come back...
[01:27:39.756 --> 01:27:50.164]  I'm going to play for you the woman where she's... Maybe I should spare you, but you want to hear the woman going, ooh, that feels, ooh, I like, ooh, ah, ah.
[01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:52.266]  You want to hear how good it is to kill a baby?
[01:27:52.266 --> 01:27:53.167]  The celebration?
[01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:58.071]  Because people need to hear the... Because what's more demonic than going, ah, kill baby, ah?
[01:27:58.071 --> 01:28:01.153]  Or, oh, God, it feels so good.
[01:28:01.153 --> 01:28:01.734]  Oh, yeah.
[01:28:04.605 --> 01:28:07.087]  Because that's how sick this evil is, folks.
[01:28:07.087 --> 01:28:09.028]  That's what they put on Vice TV.
[01:28:09.028 --> 01:28:11.369]  That's what they put out for your daughters to watch.
[01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:14.271]  To make them sick, evil freaks.
[01:28:14.271 --> 01:28:20.875]  Let's grab that little baby and let's pull it out and suck its brains out.
[01:28:20.875 --> 01:28:22.296]  Now what's scarier?
[01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:27.800]  Linda Blair and the head going around in a circle and vomiting up green pea soup and saying your mother's in hell?
[01:28:28.974 --> 01:28:35.319]  Or, you know, you haven't experienced the pleasure of killing your baby.
[01:28:35.319 --> 01:28:38.302]  Oh, it's so liberating as a woman.
[01:28:38.302 --> 01:28:40.163]  Oh, it's the best thing I ever did.
[01:28:40.163 --> 01:28:41.965]  That's how a real demon talks.
[01:28:41.965 --> 01:28:43.026]  Oh, join in with me.
[01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.827]  Let's kill more of them.
[01:28:44.827 --> 01:28:47.429]  Can I tell you how much I love Lucifer?
[01:28:47.429 --> 01:28:51.273]  And then we've got how they're targeting the mentally retarded children.
[01:28:51.273 --> 01:28:52.934]  Oh yes, CNN is now.
[01:28:52.934 --> 01:28:53.775]  Get ready for this.

[01:30:56.994 --> 01:30:57.995]  It's official.

[01:33:17.659 --> 01:33:19.000]  Babies.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.903]  Convicted pedophiles lead story time at schools.
[01:33:22.903 --> 01:33:30.469]  Baby parts are used in vaccines, and the border's wide open, and the plague is back.
[01:33:30.469 --> 01:33:32.730]  Thank you, New World Order.
[01:33:32.730 --> 01:33:38.675]  Thank you, Mommy.
[01:33:38.675 --> 01:33:45.440]  They don't want you to recognize evil so that you won't stand up yourself when you lose everything.
[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:46.161]  I know you know that.
[01:33:47.145 --> 01:33:50.329]  But we're not here covering evil so that everybody gets conditioned to it.
[01:33:50.329 --> 01:33:53.713]  We're here to get people angry and awake about it.
[01:33:53.713 --> 01:33:55.055]  And focused.
[01:33:55.055 --> 01:33:55.996]  And in its face.
[01:33:55.996 --> 01:33:56.997]  And we're winning.
[01:33:56.997 --> 01:33:57.558]  Thanks to you.
[01:33:58.988 --> 01:34:03.271]  Now there's hours of this, there's Vice ones, there's CNN ones, there's all these.
[01:34:03.271 --> 01:34:04.211]  I was going for memories.
[01:34:04.211 --> 01:34:05.372]  I remember this clip.
[01:34:05.372 --> 01:34:08.314]  They found some of it where she was, oh my abortion felt good.
[01:34:08.314 --> 01:34:10.095]  She's going, ooh, ooh.
[01:34:10.095 --> 01:34:10.876]  There's a bunch of this.
[01:34:10.876 --> 01:34:12.437]  I'm not going to air much of it.
[01:34:12.437 --> 01:34:16.680]  But she's not even like these other women talking about how they love killing their babies.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:18.040]  And you think, oh, that's tongue in cheek.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:18.641]  No.
[01:34:18.641 --> 01:34:24.765]  You go out to a pro-life rally and the literal scum of hell
[01:34:26.971 --> 01:34:30.492]  Well, do you think you go watch a Rob Zombie movie like Devil's Rejects and those are scary people?
[01:34:30.492 --> 01:34:33.372]  No.
[01:34:33.372 --> 01:34:38.314]  You go defend life and Satan's army will show up.
[01:34:38.314 --> 01:34:40.834]  And let me tell you, you don't want to be part of that army.
[01:34:40.834 --> 01:34:42.334]  Their eyes are sunk in.
[01:34:42.334 --> 01:34:43.775]  They always have green skin.
[01:34:43.775 --> 01:34:47.536]  And folks, people watch these videos and go, they do have green skin.
[01:34:47.536 --> 01:34:48.716]  The black people.
[01:34:50.365 --> 01:34:51.946]  Are whiter than white people.
[01:34:51.946 --> 01:34:52.947]  They have like green skin.
[01:34:52.947 --> 01:34:54.549]  The white people have green skin.
[01:34:54.549 --> 01:34:59.953]  It's so white, it's like that translucent day glow is what my dad calls those people.
[01:34:59.953 --> 01:35:15.146]  It's just like you read in movies or you see in movies, you read in old books and like old Greek literature and even scientific reports would say there are times when groups go crazy and the people get very white skin, they get a green color when the spirit comes over them.
[01:35:15.888 --> 01:35:20.910]  And so, you can argue all day what it is, but let me tell you, this isn't just mental illness, folks.
[01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:21.611]  They.
[01:35:21.611 --> 01:35:22.171]  Want.
[01:35:22.171 --> 01:35:22.791]  To.
[01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:23.312]  Kill.
[01:35:23.312 --> 01:35:24.052]  Babies.
[01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:31.896]  And it runs the gamut from women wanting to get on TV and talk about how great abortions are so other women feel comfortable, to the actual devil worshippers.
[01:35:31.896 --> 01:35:33.416]  But it's all the same spirit.
[01:35:33.416 --> 01:35:33.896]  Here's some of it.
[01:35:46.167 --> 01:35:47.750]  Alright, we're done.
[01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:50.014]  We're just going to wipe off the cream.
[01:35:50.014 --> 01:35:50.695]  You did great.
[01:35:50.695 --> 01:35:53.520]  Oh my gosh, you guys are my heroes.
[01:36:10.971 --> 01:36:19.318]  And if you want to go afterwards in San Francisco, you can be at the rat bar where rats actually sit at the bar with you and poop on the table.
[01:36:19.318 --> 01:36:21.280]  No, I'm not kidding.
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.161]  That's mainstream news.
[01:36:22.161 --> 01:36:22.921]  I heard it last hour.
[01:36:22.921 --> 01:36:24.983]  I'm not joking.
[01:36:24.983 --> 01:36:25.824]  Let's move on to this.
[01:36:31.323 --> 01:36:40.005]  Because the crew a few days ago said, Alex, we've noticed you've been avoiding the stack of pedophile and sexualization of kids stacks the last month or so.
[01:36:40.005 --> 01:36:43.165]  And I said, yeah, I just can't cover it anymore, but it needs to be covered.
[01:36:43.165 --> 01:36:44.066]  I said, give it all to me.
[01:36:44.066 --> 01:36:45.546]  I'm going to cover it.
[01:36:45.546 --> 01:36:48.106]  So here we go.
[01:36:48.106 --> 01:36:51.487]  CNN promotes Down syndrome drag queens.
[01:36:51.487 --> 01:36:53.828]  We're going to play some video of this for you in a moment.
[01:36:53.828 --> 01:36:55.648]  Radio listeners will be spared watching it.
[01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:06.063]  And you talk about sad, sad, sad, sad little souls.
[01:37:06.063 --> 01:37:16.466]  Remember the college professors, remember the high school teachers, the elementary students, all out of the UK, type in the headlines guys, I forgot to print this, I want to show it to the TV viewers.
[01:37:16.466 --> 01:37:21.408]  Educators in the UK saying autistic children being targeted by trans movement.
[01:37:22.202 --> 01:37:27.045]  And they go in and they tell people as young as five, six years old, oh, you can make the decision.
[01:37:27.045 --> 01:37:29.307]  You're autistic, so it's a mentally disabled person.
[01:37:29.307 --> 01:37:31.909]  They go, you want a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
[01:37:31.909 --> 01:37:34.491]  Tell us you want to be a girl.
[01:37:34.491 --> 01:37:37.253]  Peanut jelly, I girl!
[01:37:37.253 --> 01:37:43.077]  And then they boom, as young as seven, castrate them or put them on the chemicals.
[01:37:43.077 --> 01:37:44.518]  And so they come and they tell the
[01:37:46.718 --> 01:37:49.001]  Down syndrome, folks.
[01:37:49.001 --> 01:37:50.682]  You're going to be a rock star now.
[01:37:50.682 --> 01:37:52.344]  Everybody gets attention.
[01:37:52.344 --> 01:37:53.606]  You don't get a college degree.
[01:37:53.606 --> 01:37:54.106]  You don't do this.
[01:37:54.106 --> 01:37:54.587]  No, no, no.
[01:37:54.587 --> 01:38:00.293]  What you get to do is dress up like a woman, and then we say you're really cool, then you're in this whole culture.
[01:38:00.293 --> 01:38:05.179]  Well, you see, the poor Down syndrome, folks, it's well known in FBI files.
[01:38:05.179 --> 01:38:06.060]  Many books have been written on it.
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:06.981]  We've had guests on about it.
[01:38:08.117 --> 01:38:12.120]  Former top FBI agents and others like Ted Gunnarsson have broken it down here.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:14.622]  Senator John DeCampo exposed it all.
[01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:20.927]  He said their favorite group is Down Syndrome and other mentally disabled children.
[01:38:20.927 --> 01:38:25.090]  That's who the pedophiles hit first.
[01:38:25.090 --> 01:38:30.615]  And there are a lot of parents that actually try to, or foster parents, that try to adopt them
[01:38:32.233 --> 01:38:37.820]  Because no one they found will listen to them in court and they're not seen as credible or worth defending.
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:41.424]  So they're... They're the roach bait.
[01:38:42.731 --> 01:38:49.954]  for the pedophiles, and it's a big business, and you always hear about people getting busted when they're transporting these folks around, but who needs them now?
[01:38:49.954 --> 01:39:03.821]  You've got massive, 30% of the people being brought in, and they're not with their parents, little kids, and they're in there getting killed, you know, murdered, raped, dumped out, hey, it's barely in the back of the news, that's humanitarian, alright, alright, good.
[01:39:03.821 --> 01:39:04.761]  This is what liberals do.
[01:39:04.761 --> 01:39:11.284]  So, you look at these ghoulish photos of the Down Syndrome folks in their war paint,
[01:39:13.036 --> 01:39:23.590]  And just absolutely being exploited and CNN worshipping it, CNN praising it.
[01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:25.432]  Again, this is all part of CNN.
[01:39:25.432 --> 01:39:25.492]  Hey!
[01:39:27.315 --> 01:39:29.076]  Learn to be a cuckold.
[01:39:29.076 --> 01:39:32.238]  Tell your wife to wear shirts at the bar saying, I want to be gangbanged.
[01:39:32.238 --> 01:39:33.099]  Learn to be pathetic.
[01:39:33.099 --> 01:39:35.641]  Of course, statistically, that breaks up your marriage.
[01:39:35.641 --> 01:39:37.202]  But it's done over and over again.
[01:39:37.202 --> 01:39:42.605]  Whatever advice they can give you to ruin your life, to wreck you, to screw you up.
[01:39:42.605 --> 01:39:43.906]  But don't worry.
[01:39:43.906 --> 01:39:51.391]  They can go after the Down Syndrome people, age 5, 6, 7, and tell them, it's your right.
[01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:53.813]  You say you're a boy, but you're really a girl.
[01:39:55.066 --> 01:39:55.967]  I am a girl.
[01:39:55.967 --> 01:39:56.847]  I'm a girl.
[01:39:56.847 --> 01:40:00.709]  Well, let's practice putting on your wig now.
[01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:10.674]  And then, Netflix has all the new shows, and HBO has all the new shows, and Vice has all the new shows, and the New York Times has all the articles, and they're saying there's nothing wrong with pedophilia.
[01:40:10.674 --> 01:40:16.637]  Down to age 5, you know, if a man identifies as a child, he comes to your door,
[01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:21.931]  He has a right to take your daughter or shut out his car.
[01:40:21.931 --> 01:40:25.592]  We used to have to kidnap him and kill him after we had love.
[01:40:25.592 --> 01:40:29.253]  But we won't have to kill your children if you just let us have the love.
[01:40:29.253 --> 01:40:38.195]  Except we do actually kind of like to kill him, that's where... We don't just kill him to get away with it, we kind of like to... Now give me your son, and give me your daughter.
[01:40:38.195 --> 01:40:40.215]  I'm liberal!
[01:40:40.215 --> 01:40:43.916]  And I have a right to do it!
[01:40:43.916 --> 01:40:46.117]  I'm a beautiful, ornate building.
[01:40:48.604 --> 01:40:53.326]  No, give me your kid!
[01:40:53.326 --> 01:40:59.648]  So... Oh, by the way, Owen Schroyer was right here at Drag Queen Storytime in Austin today.
[01:40:59.648 --> 01:41:01.248]  He'll be coming in the studio soon.
[01:41:01.248 --> 01:41:02.188]  He streamed the footage live.
[01:41:02.188 --> 01:41:02.809]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[01:41:02.809 --> 01:41:06.890]  I'm sure it'll be in the news what a horrible bigot he is.
[01:41:06.890 --> 01:41:14.972]  Again, men in war paint, men in clown outfits, many times convicted child rapist, want to have time with your child.
[01:41:14.972 --> 01:41:16.713]  They just want him to sit on their lap.
[01:41:18.305 --> 01:41:29.408]  And even local news says, well, the kids used to get real scared, but this is why we're getting them ready to walk over to a 400-pound man with green hair, dressed like a goblin.
[01:41:29.408 --> 01:41:31.328]  You know, if it was Halloween, you'd say, what is that?
[01:41:31.328 --> 01:41:33.669]  Well, that's a tranny goblin.
[01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:35.809]  That's a goblin in a green dress.
[01:41:35.809 --> 01:41:37.270]  It's not scary at all.
[01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:41.511]  Here, children, learn how the men dress like ladies.
[01:41:41.511 --> 01:41:45.072]  Like, if you saw that looking up at you out of a gutter, you'd say, my God, is the clowns real?
[01:41:46.738 --> 01:41:48.219]  But why do you think they dress like that?
[01:41:48.219 --> 01:41:49.320]  Why do you think all over the world?
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:42:10.192]  Because since Egypt, practitioners of sex cults with children, and some of these people don't even know what they're involved in, they're not all involved in it, they just get roped in, it's being sold as a new fad, wore red fluffy hair and a red nose and a red mouth.
[01:42:13.447 --> 01:42:18.389]  Because the priests, the entities they were talking to, looked like that, so they dressed like them.
[01:42:18.389 --> 01:42:23.071]  Why is it so scary when you see a 1980s movie like Killer Clowns from Outer Space?
[01:42:23.071 --> 01:42:30.034]  You're like, why is this so scary about the way... Why do I feel like I've... There's something... Because it's real, folks.
[01:42:30.034 --> 01:42:31.395]  It's real.
[01:42:31.395 --> 01:42:33.275]  And you all know it.
[01:42:33.275 --> 01:42:38.398]  So now, armies of humans dress like interdimensional vampires.
[01:42:38.398 --> 01:42:38.818]  Like it.
[01:42:40.151 --> 01:42:42.192]  Hey, Georgie, come on over.
[01:42:42.192 --> 01:42:43.832]  I got your boat.
[01:42:43.832 --> 01:42:45.212]  Will it float?
[01:42:45.212 --> 01:42:47.193]  Oh, there's clowns and candy down here.
[01:42:47.193 --> 01:42:49.954]  Just give me your hand, Georgie.
[01:42:49.954 --> 01:42:53.555]  Give me your hand, Georgie, and I'm gonna rip it off and I'm gonna kill you.
[01:42:53.555 --> 01:42:54.735]  You understand, boy?
[01:42:54.735 --> 01:42:59.376]  InfoWars.
[01:42:59.376 --> 01:43:02.617]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:43:03.126 --> 01:43:05.067]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[01:43:05.067 --> 01:43:07.569]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:43:07.569 --> 01:43:08.509]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:43:08.509 --> 01:43:08.969]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:08.969 --> 01:43:10.270]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:12.371]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:43:12.371 --> 01:43:18.275]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, support the shirts, all the equipment.
[01:43:18.275 --> 01:43:20.236]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:43:20.236 --> 01:43:21.216]  God bless you, brother.
[01:43:21.216 --> 01:43:27.500]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody, just to help spread the word.
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:28.200]  I've read that word.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.301]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:43:29.301 --> 01:43:31.622]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:34.363]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:43:57.822 --> 01:44:05.230]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history.
[01:44:05.230 --> 01:44:09.515]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[01:44:09.515 --> 01:44:13.199]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[01:44:18.888 --> 01:44:20.589]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:44:20.589 --> 01:44:21.809]  This is racketeering.
[01:44:21.809 --> 01:44:22.930]  This is cartels.
[01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:25.331]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:44:25.331 --> 01:44:27.212]  We need it now.
[01:44:27.212 --> 01:44:28.913]  You can take on Big Tech.
[01:44:28.913 --> 01:44:37.857]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:44:37.857 --> 01:44:45.900]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:46.761]  The way to fight back
[01:44:52.022 --> 01:45:03.325]  You know the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[01:45:03.325 --> 01:45:05.106]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[01:45:05.106 --> 01:45:06.866]  Now I can be there for my children.
[01:45:06.866 --> 01:45:08.707]  Now I can make them strong.
[01:45:08.707 --> 01:45:10.347]  Now I can instruct them.
[01:45:10.347 --> 01:45:12.068]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[01:45:12.068 --> 01:45:13.068]  But not once I'm gone.
[01:45:13.168 --> 01:45:18.291]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[01:45:18.291 --> 01:45:23.895]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[01:45:23.895 --> 01:45:27.538]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[01:45:27.538 --> 01:45:32.501]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[01:45:32.501 --> 01:45:39.406]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[01:45:39.406 --> 01:45:43.068]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[01:45:43.168 --> 01:45:50.791]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[01:45:50.791 --> 01:45:57.374]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[01:45:58.342 --> 01:46:00.684]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[01:47:27.608 --> 01:47:44.240]  Alright, I don't want to get into the occult with everybody, okay, because it's quite a bottomless pit, but as I've told people many times, I happened to, growing up, brushed into, let's just say, not your run-of-the-mill vampires.
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:46.722]  And again, these aren't vampires that live forever, but it's a spirit.
[01:47:48.422 --> 01:47:52.363]  And so, I've described how there's a caste system.
[01:47:52.363 --> 01:47:56.804]  You've got the zombie-like servants of evil that are more like robots.
[01:47:56.804 --> 01:48:00.225]  Then you've got the familiars that serve the evil ones.
[01:48:00.225 --> 01:48:11.909]  And then you've got several classes of Satanists that go up to actual, generally royalty, actually from places like Transylvania.
[01:48:13.016 --> 01:48:15.557]  And you just can't make this up.
[01:48:15.557 --> 01:48:17.939]  And, you know, you're watching Trump over there with the Queen and all that.
[01:48:17.939 --> 01:48:18.939]  It was totally disgusting.
[01:48:18.939 --> 01:48:20.360]  I understand it's politics.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:21.700]  He's got to meet with Kim Jong-un as well.
[01:48:21.700 --> 01:48:24.722]  You know, he sent Kushner to Bilderberg.
[01:48:24.722 --> 01:48:28.364]  I care about the policies, and I get he's got to meet with these people.
[01:48:28.364 --> 01:48:34.246]  But you have to understand that Prince Charles has done documentaries.
[01:48:34.246 --> 01:48:41.010]  I first learned about this 22 years ago in Bloodlines of the Illuminati by Fritz Springer.
[01:48:42.102 --> 01:48:48.968]  That they were House Dracula and that they went all the way back to that and they founded the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[01:48:48.968 --> 01:48:59.817]  And I read a lot of books about the Austro-Hungarian Empire and I knew about most of the British royalty being German, who were really Hungarian or Romanian.
[01:48:59.817 --> 01:49:03.300]  And so I knew about a lot of that, but I was like, this is too much.
[01:49:03.300 --> 01:49:06.783]  And about five years later, it was on CNN that
[01:49:11.385 --> 01:49:17.150]  Indeed it was true that they traced their lineage back to Egypt and a bunch of other places.
[01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:21.613]  Now whether that's true or not, that's what they believe.
[01:49:21.613 --> 01:49:25.416]  And so now Prince Charles only spends half the year in England.
[01:49:25.416 --> 01:49:28.599]  He lives in Castle Dracula.
[01:49:28.599 --> 01:49:29.660]  You can't make this up!
[01:49:31.004 --> 01:49:32.165]  So again, I'm just like you.
[01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:39.391]  20 years ago, 22 years ago, I'm reading Bloodlines of the Illuminati, and a lot of it I knew was true, but a lot of it I'm like, this is insane.
[01:49:39.391 --> 01:49:53.803]  Okay, he's directly related to Dracula, and that's really the main line behind the House of Windsor, which is really Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and it turns out it's all true.
[01:49:53.803 --> 01:49:58.807]  And by the way, it's not just his dad, it's his mom, all of them, and they see that as the most important bloodline.
[01:50:00.376 --> 01:50:19.968]  And so when I get into this, folks, I, listen, I used to have three-star Air Force generals and Army generals and retired FBI agents and current FBI agents and former, you know, head FBI agents that, like, ran the Southern District of California.
[01:50:19.968 --> 01:50:28.813]  Telling me at dinner, they're devil worshipers, they drink kids' blood, they eat the proletariat lands, and I'm just thinking, well, this general's really smart, but
[01:50:30.302 --> 01:50:34.924]  This is crazier than you're talking to a former FBI person and they're telling you this.
[01:50:34.924 --> 01:50:38.486]  And they're just talking to you like they're talking about the color of grass outside.
[01:50:38.486 --> 01:50:40.828]  It's all true, people!
[01:50:40.828 --> 01:50:45.330]  So listen, I don't blame you if you can't handle it.
[01:50:45.330 --> 01:50:49.732]  But most of the vaccines we take are grown on dead babies.
[01:50:49.732 --> 01:50:53.254]  They've got all these sneaky ways to sneak it into the food.
[01:50:53.254 --> 01:50:54.315]  You ask, why are they doing it?
[01:50:54.315 --> 01:50:56.156]  Because they need us to be
[01:50:57.677 --> 01:51:05.740]  Corrupted spiritually as a spiritual rule, like the vampire cuts himself in the chest and gets you to drink of it, so you become one.
[01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:10.782]  It's metaphysical, just like we eat the flesh of Christ to remember him, we drink his blood.
[01:51:10.782 --> 01:51:13.423]  Why do you think Christ was doing that?
[01:51:13.423 --> 01:51:20.306]  He was doing that to say, I'm doing this one time, it's with me, it's a symbol, it's spiritual to counteract their religion!
[01:51:22.332 --> 01:51:23.712]  Think about how heavy that is.
[01:51:23.712 --> 01:51:29.294]  And of course, the Satanists go, well, your God talks about drinking blood.
[01:51:29.294 --> 01:51:31.395]  Yeah.
[01:51:31.395 --> 01:51:33.036]  Exactly.
[01:51:33.036 --> 01:51:37.917]  Now you get the big secret, don't you?
[01:51:37.917 --> 01:51:40.178]  God sent his son, his consciousness,
[01:51:42.094 --> 01:51:51.803]  Into the fray, had all the knowledge, all the power to go through what we go through, to be fair, because God put us, his children, with free conscious will, into the universe.
[01:51:51.803 --> 01:51:54.386]  The potential for a whole new universe is in each one of us.
[01:51:54.386 --> 01:51:55.306]  Free will.
[01:51:55.306 --> 01:52:04.014]  Only way a real God could be God is to make new creatures that could be potentially in the same line.
[01:52:04.014 --> 01:52:06.677]  And what did Christ say at the Last Supper?
[01:52:09.025 --> 01:52:11.026]  Take this bread as a symbol of my flesh.
[01:52:11.026 --> 01:52:13.086]  It's going to be broken for you.
[01:52:13.086 --> 01:52:15.227]  And take this wine as a symbol of my blood.
[01:52:15.227 --> 01:52:18.268]  It binds us together.
[01:52:18.268 --> 01:52:19.949]  What's the exact scripture?
[01:52:19.949 --> 01:52:21.149]  You're right.
[01:52:21.149 --> 01:52:26.851]  You would say that's a vampiric ritual.
[01:52:26.851 --> 01:52:29.912]  But it's a ritual ending the vampire rituals.
[01:52:29.912 --> 01:52:35.494]  It's a ritual saying you don't need kids, you don't need people, you don't need sacrifices at the temple anymore.
[01:52:35.494 --> 01:52:37.855]  Vampirism was all over that area at that time.
[01:52:38.901 --> 01:52:44.106]  All you need is spiritually to be with God.
[01:52:44.106 --> 01:52:45.447]  And all you need is bread and wine.
[01:52:45.447 --> 01:52:53.974]  You don't need to drink blood anymore.
[01:52:53.974 --> 01:52:59.659]  Now you start to get the big picture, don't you, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:52:59.659 --> 01:53:01.361]  And why the vampires are so pissed.
[01:53:04.261 --> 01:53:11.527]  Because they're offering people eternal life, spiritual, which of course it's eternal death, if they drink the blood of the innocents.
[01:53:11.527 --> 01:53:13.509]  And God says, don't do that.
[01:53:13.509 --> 01:53:26.219]  I'm going to show you, I'm going to let them kill me and torture the hell out of me, and I'm going to transcend it to show you you can transcend, and you can now just have a glass of wine in remembrance of me.
[01:53:26.219 --> 01:53:29.242]  You don't have to worship Satan anymore.
[01:53:34.378 --> 01:53:39.885]  All over the Middle East at that time, they were murdering their children on altars.
[01:53:39.885 --> 01:53:43.869]  Drinking their children's blood.
[01:53:43.869 --> 01:53:50.217]  See, it's not a Bram Stoker novel anymore, is it?
[01:53:50.217 --> 01:53:51.779]  And now they have clinics where I live.
[01:53:53.499 --> 01:54:16.470]  a mile from my house where rich people go and get the blood of children and the government's got waivers now if the children decide, their parents decide as young as eight-year-olds are banking their blood for college money and rich men and women are shooting it into their veins.
[01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:17.551]  It's been going on for a long time.
[01:54:22.529 --> 01:54:26.993]  Let's show what's on the hors d'oeuvre list.
[01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:37.161]  And all these school teachers tell you they're targeting the autistic, they're targeting the chromosomal disadvantaged or over-advantaged.
[01:54:37.161 --> 01:54:45.508]  They are targeting them and tricking them to be cool into their club, just like in Pinocchio, tricking the kids to be thugs so they'd waive their rights and become slaves.
[01:54:46.766 --> 01:54:48.627]  Let's go ahead and roll a clip of CNN.
[01:54:48.627 --> 01:54:53.971]  The video's got more than 5 million views on Facebook right now, with them praising it as the most beautiful thing they've ever seen.
[01:54:53.971 --> 01:54:54.452]  Here it is.
[01:55:16.681 --> 01:55:19.323]  I'm never nervous when it comes to performing.
[01:55:19.323 --> 01:55:22.785]  My favourite part is the dancing and lip-syncing.
[01:55:22.785 --> 01:55:24.366]  But mostly the performation, really.
[01:55:26.701 --> 01:55:31.403]  I feel really confident to work with different people with disability.
[01:55:31.403 --> 01:55:32.464]  I don't want to do that.
[01:55:32.464 --> 01:55:41.648]  It's a big fetish not just to have sex with Down Syndrome children because they can't report you, but there's a lot of really horrible names for it and stuff.
[01:55:41.648 --> 01:55:47.171]  I learned about this like 20 years ago from former CIA and stuff and it's just unbelievable.
[01:55:47.171 --> 01:55:50.732]  And that's what they even said, they dress them up like this and everything else.
[01:55:50.732 --> 01:55:55.495]  I don't know these poor folks and what they're involved in obviously, but this is the disadvantage being taken advantage of.
[01:55:55.495 --> 01:55:55.715]  Here it is.
[01:55:57.310 --> 01:56:03.214]  My name is Daniel Weiss and I'm the creative director of Drug Syndrome.
[01:56:03.214 --> 01:56:08.738]  As far as I'm aware, we are the only drug troupe for drug artists with Down Syndrome.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:14.641]  The artists that I work with are very open-minded.
[01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:17.983]  So I asked them, would you like to try to do drug?
[01:56:17.983 --> 01:56:19.303]  And they got so excited.
[01:56:19.303 --> 01:56:25.646]  They started researching drugs, styles of drugs.
[01:56:25.646 --> 01:56:28.267]  And then they start to develop their own drug character.
[01:56:30.806 --> 01:56:33.988]  She is called Madam X. She's a super spy.
[01:56:33.988 --> 01:56:37.069]  What's the highest level of suicide and AIDS and everything else?
[01:56:37.069 --> 01:56:37.549]  Trans people.
[01:56:37.549 --> 01:56:40.491]  Which is a sex market right into these men.
[01:56:40.491 --> 01:56:48.735]  Justin Bond is a big flirt and as myself, I don't flirt that much with other guys because I'm a bit different than that.
[01:56:51.158 --> 01:57:02.789]  The misconception we encounter to do with people with Down syndrome, that they have no mind of their own, that they are cute and sweet and that's it.
[01:57:02.789 --> 01:57:03.910]  That's completely untrue.
[01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:05.031]  So then they're fetishizing the whole deal?
[01:57:05.031 --> 01:57:08.955]  Yes, they are very, very sweet and beautiful, but also they are very fierce.
[01:57:09.315 --> 01:57:13.478]  Mr. DJ, please press that drag button!
[01:57:13.478 --> 01:57:17.642]  I think people with Down Syndrome have extra chromosomes that bring them extra talent.
[01:57:17.642 --> 01:57:20.164]  By the way, they've watched a bunch of... I've watched some of this.
[01:57:20.164 --> 01:57:23.747]  It's all very sick, very... Names like, you know, Fish Pants.
[01:57:23.747 --> 01:57:25.148]  It all puts women down.
[01:57:25.148 --> 01:57:27.750]  This is just men coming in and taking over women.
[01:57:28.727 --> 01:57:30.670]  And then telling women, oh, I'm really a woman.
[01:57:30.670 --> 01:57:32.412]  And a woman says, no, there's only women that are women.
[01:57:32.412 --> 01:57:33.073]  Men are men.
[01:57:33.073 --> 01:57:33.654]  You're fired!
[01:57:33.654 --> 01:57:34.134]  You're gone!
[01:57:34.134 --> 01:57:35.776]  I'm a woman now!
[01:57:35.776 --> 01:57:44.627]  And then they can, just like homeless people use a dog to get more money, now these cults are going to use mentally disabled children as a way to try to say, well, don't be against the mentally disabled children!
[01:57:47.386 --> 01:57:49.027]  Do not shut down our speech!
[01:57:49.027 --> 01:57:54.529]  We're at Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[01:57:54.529 --> 01:58:02.033]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:58:02.033 --> 01:58:03.353]  Are you coming back?
[01:58:03.353 --> 01:58:04.494]  We're at Infowars.com.
[01:58:05.094 --> 01:58:06.474]  We're at newswars.com.

[01:58:20.999 --> 01:58:22.499]  Woo!
[01:58:24.073 --> 01:58:26.855]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[01:58:26.855 --> 01:58:28.676]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[01:58:28.676 --> 01:58:31.418]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:58:31.418 --> 01:58:33.640]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.

[01:58:43.146 --> 01:58:45.128]  You know, there's things called websites.
[01:58:45.128 --> 01:58:45.528]  Just go there.
[01:58:50.903 --> 01:59:00.310]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.

[01:59:51.867 --> 01:59:54.530]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:08.405 --> 02:00:10.907]  You can't come inside!
[02:00:10.907 --> 02:00:14.909]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:00:14.909 --> 02:00:22.754]  Hollywood!
[02:00:22.754 --> 02:00:23.614]  Hollywood!
[02:00:51.505 --> 02:00:54.547]  What happens to civilizations?
[02:00:54.547 --> 02:00:57.308]  What happens to civilizations?
[02:00:57.308 --> 02:00:58.229]  What happens to cultures?
[02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.949]  Why do they fall?
[02:00:58.949 --> 02:01:01.510]  Why do they fall apart?
[02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:10.835]  I'm gonna take seven phone calls on the board because if I wait longer than that and get too many on, some will be on hold at the end and I'm not gonna do that to you.
[02:01:10.835 --> 02:01:16.718]  I'm gonna take seven phone calls about what we've covered the last hour.
[02:01:16.718 --> 02:01:17.959]  The totally collapsed border,
[02:01:19.298 --> 02:01:29.184]  The disease is pouring in, the admissions of society is collapsing, the sexualization of children, the media praising abortion because it's fun to kill babies and empowering for women.
[02:01:29.184 --> 02:01:30.765]  That's why Satan doesn't sacrifice babies.
[02:01:30.765 --> 02:01:41.592]  They say it's empowering to have the will to kill a child, much less your own child.
[02:01:41.592 --> 02:01:42.772]  The devil wants you to kill yourself.
[02:01:42.772 --> 02:01:48.136]  And if you can't get that, the next best thing is getting you to kill your child or another child.
[02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:57.574]  So that you go so far down the rat hole of evil that you'll never be visited by the Holy Spirit again.
[02:01:57.574 --> 02:02:04.017]  And so I don't want to cover these horrible things here on air, these macabre things, but these aren't Stephen King novels.
[02:02:04.017 --> 02:02:08.200]  These aren't plagiarized bilge.
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:12.302]  These are real things happening in the real world.
[02:02:14.105 --> 02:02:28.956]  And to a man, woman, and child, people signed on to the leftist, globalist, left-hand path are on Satan's team.
[02:02:28.956 --> 02:02:32.979]  It's really simple.
[02:02:32.979 --> 02:02:36.582]  And when you figure that out, Hollywood means nothing to you anymore.
[02:02:36.582 --> 02:02:40.225]  And what people think about you means nothing anymore.
[02:02:40.225 --> 02:02:43.247]  And all the world's crap, and it's not stressful anymore.
[02:02:44.824 --> 02:02:51.750]  The only stress, though, is that you're not doing enough, I'm not doing enough, to fight these bastards.
[02:02:51.750 --> 02:02:52.551]  And, you know, it's not fair.
[02:02:52.551 --> 02:02:55.073]  There's a lot of great men and women that are bastards.
[02:02:55.073 --> 02:02:58.636]  I don't want to bash people that come from single-parent homes.
[02:02:58.636 --> 02:03:03.680]  I use the term bastard, or cockroach, or things like that, or pieces of crap.
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:06.543]  A piece of crap you can use for fertilizer.
[02:03:06.543 --> 02:03:09.365]  The globalists are little black holes.
[02:03:10.421 --> 02:03:19.385]  They're to suck anything innocent, anything good, anything decent down into them, because in the archetype, why does a zombie want brains?
[02:03:19.385 --> 02:03:23.347]  Because the zombie doesn't have brains.
[02:03:23.347 --> 02:03:26.988]  And people always want what they don't have.
[02:03:26.988 --> 02:03:28.569]  Innocence.
[02:03:28.569 --> 02:03:30.310]  Beauty.
[02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:31.670]  Potential.
[02:03:31.670 --> 02:03:33.071]  Like a seed.
[02:03:33.071 --> 02:03:34.752]  They sold out.
[02:03:34.752 --> 02:03:37.353]  They gave up their birthright.
[02:03:37.353 --> 02:03:39.914]  And so when you've joined the Devil's Legion,
[02:03:41.758 --> 02:03:48.320]  And you see a baby or you see a healthy, happy family.
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:59.024]  Well, you want to see them hurt just like the parable of sleeping beauty.
[02:03:59.024 --> 02:04:08.288]  The evil queen, the evil witch up on the hill, she didn't get invited to the king and queen getting married.
[02:04:08.288 --> 02:04:09.308]  So a few years later,
[02:04:12.321 --> 02:04:15.303]  She tricks the little girl into pricking her finger.
[02:04:15.303 --> 02:04:17.985]  A little vaccine for you.
[02:04:17.985 --> 02:04:19.407]  A little something they want.
[02:04:19.407 --> 02:04:20.407]  A little something.
[02:04:20.407 --> 02:04:21.288]  A little needling.
[02:04:21.288 --> 02:04:22.789]  A little something for you.
[02:04:22.789 --> 02:04:25.531]  A little corruption for you.
[02:04:25.531 --> 02:04:28.794]  And then she falls into that deep sleep.
[02:04:28.794 --> 02:04:32.557]  All because she didn't serve the witch.
[02:04:32.557 --> 02:04:34.398]  But see, there's something that can break the spell.
[02:04:34.398 --> 02:04:34.979]  True love.
[02:04:36.055 --> 02:04:37.637]  Prince Charming.
[02:04:37.637 --> 02:04:52.093]  But Prince Charming has to kill the dragon, the dracul, the witch, before he can kiss Sleeping Beauty and free her and reunite the kingdom and have children again.
[02:04:56.235 --> 02:05:01.437]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.437 --> 02:05:10.000]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.981]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:12.981 --> 02:05:14.721]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.721 --> 02:05:21.003]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:05:23.104 --> 02:05:28.427]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[02:05:28.427 --> 02:05:31.368]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.368 --> 02:05:34.970]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:39.272]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.272 --> 02:05:41.113]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:41.113 --> 02:05:47.196]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:47.196 --> 02:05:48.057]  Don't live
[02:05:48.877 --> 02:05:52.559]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[02:05:52.559 --> 02:05:56.782]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:56.782 --> 02:05:58.863]  I'm angry.
[02:05:58.863 --> 02:06:00.945]  I've had enough of these people.
[02:06:00.945 --> 02:06:03.226]  They're a bunch of gristly mutters on their vagina.
[02:06:03.226 --> 02:06:05.928]  Factories keeping babies alive and selling their body parts.
[02:06:05.928 --> 02:06:07.849]  What do you need to know about these people?
[02:06:07.849 --> 02:06:09.951]  I'd go out and face these scum.
[02:06:09.951 --> 02:06:11.612]  They're literally brought out from under us.
[02:06:11.612 --> 02:06:16.855]  They have green looking skin and they run around screaming, we love Satan, we want to eat babies.
[02:06:16.855 --> 02:06:17.655]  How's my mom feeling?
[02:07:37.506 --> 02:07:38.528]  I think?
[02:09:01.192 --> 02:09:01.972]  Welcome back folks.
[02:09:01.972 --> 02:09:04.774]  That's one of the fan-made videos from a few years ago.
[02:09:04.774 --> 02:09:10.698]  Hundreds got made off of that Bon Iver thing that Super Deluxe did that they thought would hurt us.
[02:09:10.698 --> 02:09:16.441]  Actually only made InfoWars bigger, getting watched more than 20 million times.
[02:09:16.441 --> 02:09:17.782]  Okay, here's what's going on.
[02:09:17.782 --> 02:09:19.583]  I want to open the phones up specifically
[02:09:21.912 --> 02:09:34.835]  On Trump coming out today and signing an order saying no more baby parts used in medical experiments, that will really put a dent in them harvesting children and keeping them alive.
[02:09:34.835 --> 02:09:38.736]  So kudos to Trump, really taking action, really impressed with that.
[02:09:38.736 --> 02:09:40.836]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:09:40.836 --> 02:09:48.258]  Some listeners even called in and some called the office and I even had one of the crew members go, hey, we think it's really bad that Jared Kushner went to Bilderberg.
[02:09:49.909 --> 02:09:54.331]  And I said, well Trump also met with Kim Jong-un, who is a horrible little vampire bat in my view.
[02:09:54.331 --> 02:09:57.793]  That's his spirit animal is a vampire bat.
[02:09:57.793 --> 02:09:59.614]  And he's a terrible person.
[02:09:59.614 --> 02:10:07.118]  But I said, if we can get them to stop enslaving their people and start economically empowering them, that's certainly a good step.
[02:10:07.118 --> 02:10:09.420]  Trump's not for Kim Jong-un that he's meeting with him.
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:11.121]  He's trying to fix it.
[02:10:11.121 --> 02:10:17.044]  But if I see any globalist activity out of Trump from the Bilderberg Group, then I will scream bloody murder and run around like a chicken with my head cut off.
[02:10:18.928 --> 02:10:19.808]  That's where I stand.
[02:10:19.808 --> 02:10:22.249]  All I see is Trump really trying to fix stuff.
[02:10:22.249 --> 02:10:26.291]  And again, Ann Coulter, I use this example a lot because it's so obvious.
[02:10:26.291 --> 02:10:32.914]  She gets headlines when she says Trump sold us out on immigration, Trump's terrible, blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:32.914 --> 02:10:39.436]  Oh, we've got double the illegals coming in since Trump got in.
[02:10:39.436 --> 02:10:44.779]  Well, that's because the UN opened the floodgates and the refugee centers and they're staging it all just like Europe.
[02:10:44.779 --> 02:10:45.519]  They admit they are.
[02:10:46.684 --> 02:10:49.266]  And George Soros is giving $1,000 out of U.S.
[02:10:49.266 --> 02:10:57.853]  taxpayer money he got during the Obama era through the State Department to anybody that'll try to get here, on top of free plane tickets.
[02:10:57.853 --> 02:11:01.717]  So it's like seeing a foreign army attack this, so it's Trump's fault.
[02:11:01.717 --> 02:11:05.380]  This is the globalists making their move, and I'm not just here to defend Trump.
[02:11:07.481 --> 02:11:15.225]  All I get is grief, and all I get is attacks, and all I get is lawsuits and nightmares from defending Trump.
[02:11:15.225 --> 02:11:19.087]  That's how I know Trump's got the globalists pissed.
[02:11:19.087 --> 02:11:21.989]  And so the more I'm under attack, the more I do what I do.
[02:11:21.989 --> 02:11:26.231]  See, because I'm not here to get along with the system.
[02:11:26.231 --> 02:11:35.016]  I'm here to find the globalists, and I'm here to engage them, and I'm here to fight them, and I'm here to do that until they're defeated or I'm dead.
[02:11:36.405 --> 02:11:40.087]  And if I get killed in the process, or destroyed, the fight goes on.
[02:11:40.087 --> 02:11:43.928]  But I'm going to do this until they're defeated, or until I'm dead.
[02:11:43.928 --> 02:11:45.329]  Period.
[02:11:45.329 --> 02:11:47.190]  I love that John Paul Jones quote.
[02:11:47.190 --> 02:11:58.074]  You know, he says, I've only begun to fight when the British had a ship two and a half, three times bigger than his, and his ship was on fire, but he still had his artillery, his cannons going.
[02:11:58.074 --> 02:12:01.916]  And they said, do you want to give up shouting across, you know, through a bullhorn?
[02:12:01.916 --> 02:12:04.277]  Not an electric one, but you know, from a hailer, hailer is what they call them.
[02:12:05.087 --> 02:12:32.253]  uh... and uh... he said no i've only begun to fight about thirty minutes later they had to give up because they were seeking for real yet another quote i'm paraphrasing but he said writing a letter after that ship was messed up he said i only want the fastest ships because i intend to always go directly into action what he's saying is i want the attack ships i want the best ships i want the ships you mean for war i don't want to take
[02:12:33.311 --> 02:12:35.452]  Flower to the troops, which is an important mission.
[02:12:35.452 --> 02:12:37.372]  I don't want to be in the Merchant Marine.
[02:12:37.372 --> 02:12:42.734]  I want to go directly into combat as fast as possible.
[02:12:42.734 --> 02:12:44.575]  That's exactly what I want.
[02:12:44.575 --> 02:12:46.555]  And it's not because I'm some macho person.
[02:12:46.555 --> 02:12:48.796]  These people are evil.
[02:12:48.796 --> 02:12:50.937]  And the only way to go up against them is 110%.
[02:12:50.937 --> 02:12:54.958]  Can you imagine running from these people?
[02:12:54.958 --> 02:12:56.699]  What that would feel like?
[02:12:56.699 --> 02:12:56.779]  No.
[02:12:58.021 --> 02:13:01.489]  I only intend to go into harm's way.
[02:13:01.489 --> 02:13:04.375]  See, you guys are doing an incredible job pulling this stuff up as fast as I can talk.
[02:13:05.982 --> 02:13:08.644]  John Paul Jones, I only want the fastest ships.
[02:13:08.644 --> 02:13:10.926]  I want to read that quote properly on air.
[02:13:10.926 --> 02:13:15.029]  And so as listeners, and as all of us here, I think we only want the fastest ships, right?
[02:13:15.029 --> 02:13:15.930]  We want to be effective.
[02:13:15.930 --> 02:13:17.451]  We want to be in the fight.
[02:13:17.451 --> 02:13:19.212]  We want to really change things.
[02:13:19.212 --> 02:13:25.537]  We want to kind of live up to our grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, and great-grandmothers that supported them, and great-great-great-great-great-grandparents.
[02:13:25.537 --> 02:13:26.998]  You know, those were some sturdy people.
[02:13:26.998 --> 02:13:31.501]  And they weren't looking for fights, but you started a fight with them, they were known all over the world.
[02:13:31.501 --> 02:13:33.023]  Americans will give you a fight.
[02:13:33.023 --> 02:13:34.504]  If you wanted one, you'd get one.
[02:13:36.974 --> 02:13:44.338]  And if you want to get mean and you want to get vicious and you want to really, really get your neck broken, you really want to get hurt bad, we'll do what you want.
[02:13:44.338 --> 02:13:45.899]  That's what you're looking for.
[02:13:45.899 --> 02:13:47.840]  You came to the right place.
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:49.761]  Because I'm not going to be your damn slave.
[02:13:49.761 --> 02:13:53.223]  And I'm not going to sit here and watch you rape and hurt and brainwash kids.
[02:13:53.223 --> 02:13:55.825]  And so people ask me if I'm afraid of these people.
[02:13:55.825 --> 02:13:58.166]  Yeah, I'm afraid that I'm not strong enough.
[02:13:58.166 --> 02:14:00.988]  And I'm pissed at myself every minute that I'm weak.
[02:14:03.393 --> 02:14:10.416]  I don't take care of my body right, and I'm not strong enough, and I can only go 15 hours now!
[02:14:10.416 --> 02:14:16.399]  So that's why when you call in and tell me how great I am, it's like slapping me in the face, because let me tell you something, I'm not doing what I need to do.
[02:14:16.399 --> 02:14:22.041]  These people are evil, and children and others are depending on us to get these damn vampires off of them.
[02:14:24.121 --> 02:14:31.844]  Because you see, if what Alex Jones is doing is supposedly, oh, the most you can do, or what Trump's doing is even greater, or what Drudge is doing is super great, or whatever.
[02:14:31.844 --> 02:14:35.545]  Oh, thank God Drudge is there, or thank God Alex Jones is there, or thank God Trump's there.
[02:14:35.545 --> 02:14:36.666]  We've missed the whole boat.
[02:14:36.666 --> 02:14:44.189]  Thank God Tucker Carlson's there, or Sean Hannity's there.
[02:14:44.189 --> 02:14:45.029]  It's you that's there.
[02:14:46.172 --> 02:14:47.632]  You're everywhere in this country.
[02:14:47.632 --> 02:14:48.493]  You're all over this world.
[02:14:48.493 --> 02:14:49.653]  You're the eyes and ears.
[02:14:49.653 --> 02:14:56.494]  You've got all the cards, all the munitions politically, all the power.
[02:14:56.494 --> 02:14:57.835]  And I've seen who you are.
[02:14:57.835 --> 02:14:59.295]  You are smart.
[02:14:59.295 --> 02:15:00.195]  You are strong.
[02:15:00.195 --> 02:15:05.677]  You've got the light of God in your eyes.
[02:15:05.677 --> 02:15:07.737]  People that serve the enemy have dead eyes.
[02:15:07.737 --> 02:15:11.178]  People that know God have that fire in the eye.
[02:15:11.178 --> 02:15:13.799]  Fire in the eyes of men and women.
[02:15:13.799 --> 02:15:15.639]  And you've got the ball.
[02:15:16.741 --> 02:15:22.784]  So all I'm telling you is, they say the teacher appears when the student's ready.
[02:15:22.784 --> 02:15:24.745]  You are my teacher.
[02:15:24.745 --> 02:15:26.926]  I am your teacher.
[02:15:26.926 --> 02:15:27.966]  And this is real.
[02:15:27.966 --> 02:15:32.628]  And the fact that you're tuned into this show, shows you care.
[02:15:32.628 --> 02:15:34.629]  And that you want to do something.
[02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:36.510]  And that you're focused.
[02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:38.250]  And that you're a leader.
[02:15:38.250 --> 02:15:39.091]  So start acting like it.
[02:15:39.974 --> 02:15:40.474]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:15:40.474 --> 02:15:40.534]  877-789-2539.
[02:15:40.534 --> 02:15:40.594]  877-789-2539.
[02:15:40.594 --> 02:15:40.835]  877-789-Alex!
[02:15:40.835 --> 02:15:44.056]  What do you make of the coming out of the pedophiles everywhere?
[02:15:44.056 --> 02:15:44.977]  What do you make of it?
[02:15:44.977 --> 02:15:46.218]  What should be done about it?
[02:15:55.485 --> 02:15:55.926]  Ugh!

[02:16:56.318 --> 02:17:00.240]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:01.781]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.781 --> 02:17:04.743]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.743 --> 02:17:10.306]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:17:39.959 --> 02:17:43.740]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:45.000]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:46.361]  Who do we fight for?

[02:19:04.346 --> 02:19:08.969]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[02:19:08.969 --> 02:19:10.910]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[02:19:10.910 --> 02:19:15.472]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[02:19:15.752 --> 02:19:21.739]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[02:19:21.739 --> 02:19:22.459]  I appreciate that.
[02:19:22.459 --> 02:19:24.121]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:19:24.121 --> 02:19:24.722]  Tell us about it.

[02:19:26.784 --> 02:19:27.304]  I take it.
[02:19:27.304 --> 02:19:28.045]  It tastes good.
[02:19:28.045 --> 02:19:29.887]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:19:29.887 --> 02:19:31.849]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[02:19:31.849 --> 02:19:35.293]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[02:19:35.333 --> 02:19:38.175]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.

[02:20:32.505 --> 02:20:36.127]  Just went down to the Drag Queen story time with little babies.
[02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:37.967]  Some of them toddlers being indoctrinated.
[02:20:37.967 --> 02:20:44.329]  And the big fat men in clown outfits.
[02:20:44.329 --> 02:20:48.551]  Telling them about shaking their booties.
[02:20:48.551 --> 02:20:53.172]  Yeah, this isn't a Twilight Zone episode.
[02:20:53.172 --> 02:20:54.133]  It's not a badass trip.
[02:20:54.133 --> 02:20:54.553]  It's happening.
[02:20:55.503 --> 02:20:59.247]  What happens when good men and women do nothing?
[02:20:59.247 --> 02:21:01.349]  Evil triumphs.
[02:21:01.349 --> 02:21:03.031]  But you see humanity fighting back.
[02:21:03.031 --> 02:21:03.912]  You see the signs of that.
[02:21:03.912 --> 02:21:06.354]  You see the enemy panicking.
[02:21:06.354 --> 02:21:11.760]  Bill, Mike, Deshaun, Brian, Jeff and others, taking your calls.
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:14.102]  Billy in the great state of Pennsylvania.
[02:21:14.102 --> 02:21:15.043]  Thanks for calling today.
[02:21:15.043 --> 02:21:16.865]  We really appreciate you taking time out.
[02:21:16.865 --> 02:21:17.766]  What is your take on
[02:21:19.042 --> 02:21:19.703]  Or do you disagree?
[02:21:19.703 --> 02:21:24.027]  I mean, it's all over the news, all over Netflix, all over Snapchat, just everywhere.
[02:21:24.027 --> 02:21:30.733]  Namble is good, have sex with kids, let the children be loved by the men, and oh, so loving.
[02:21:30.733 --> 02:21:33.655]  What do you think is going on here?
[02:21:33.655 --> 02:21:37.238]  I think it's ugh, with a side of ugh.
[02:21:37.238 --> 02:21:38.399]  Yeah.
[02:21:38.399 --> 02:21:40.041]  It's all pretty terrible, my friend.
[02:21:40.041 --> 02:21:44.225]  And I just wanted to tell you that you have incredible support up here in the great state of VA.
[02:21:45.711 --> 02:21:50.654]  There's a lot of folks that wake up in PA and everywhere else.
[02:21:50.654 --> 02:21:51.815]  Where do you think this is going?
[02:21:51.815 --> 02:21:55.057]  What do you think we as citizens should do?
[02:21:55.057 --> 02:22:00.020]  I think we've got to get right with God, my friend.
[02:22:00.020 --> 02:22:12.147]  I have a Netflix subscription, and I've been noticing the trend of programming that all their original content seems to be skewed in a very dark manner.
[02:22:14.369 --> 02:22:31.488]  And it just it feels like perpetually this is the system that is being pushed upon us and you know it's up to us individually to see the evil and rise above.
[02:22:31.488 --> 02:22:33.531]  I'm sure you've heard me talk about Sundance this year.
[02:22:34.867 --> 02:22:38.728]  We had a representative there and they were openly talking about it, but also in private meetings.
[02:22:38.728 --> 02:22:44.550]  Well, Hollywood's only going to fund stuff that depresses people and demoralizes.
[02:22:44.550 --> 02:22:46.570]  And the excuse was, you know, to make people hate Trump.
[02:22:46.570 --> 02:22:47.750]  No, no, that's not what it is.
[02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:50.591]  It's to make people give up and to hate themselves.
[02:22:50.591 --> 02:22:53.452]  This is an evil cup being poured out upon us.
[02:22:53.452 --> 02:22:55.433]  A hundred percent, man.
[02:22:55.433 --> 02:22:56.513]  A hundred percent.
[02:22:56.513 --> 02:23:00.654]  And like, you can really, I don't know, nowadays it's palpable.
[02:23:01.092 --> 02:23:03.192]  Like, you can see it in people.
[02:23:03.192 --> 02:23:04.333]  You can see it in people's eyes.
[02:23:04.333 --> 02:23:07.553]  You can get that energy off of certain people in a room.
[02:23:07.553 --> 02:23:08.314]  I totally agree.
[02:23:08.314 --> 02:23:10.614]  People are giving themselves over to an evil spirit.
[02:23:10.614 --> 02:23:11.974]  I mean, you see it in people.
[02:23:11.974 --> 02:23:12.975]  It's spreading.
[02:23:12.975 --> 02:23:13.515]  We've got to pray.
[02:23:13.515 --> 02:23:14.455]  We've got to reach out to folks.
[02:23:14.455 --> 02:23:16.255]  We've got to be loving to people.
[02:23:16.255 --> 02:23:20.856]  I don't know what you do once they're under the zombiosis, but it's very, very sad.
[02:23:20.856 --> 02:23:21.496]  Thank you, Billy.
[02:23:21.496 --> 02:23:23.977]  It's a very dark time, folks.
[02:23:23.977 --> 02:23:24.897]  But good things are happening.
[02:23:24.897 --> 02:23:27.198]  The President just banned keeping babies alive.
[02:23:27.198 --> 02:23:28.898]  Well, he just banned selling the organs.
[02:23:30.521 --> 02:23:33.983]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:23:33.983 --> 02:23:50.832]  The reason I wanted to call today is because I've been listening to your show all day today and God bless you.
[02:23:50.832 --> 02:23:58.896]  I just wanted to say I read the Bible every single night because I'm a Christian and I think it's important to read the Bible every night.
[02:23:59.517 --> 02:24:07.164]  And one of the main themes that I get from reading the Bible all the time is that God is in charge.
[02:24:07.164 --> 02:24:16.953]  And what I was reading last night I felt kind of pertained to what you've been talking about, because with all the stuff going on in the world, especially with regards to
[02:24:17.645 --> 02:24:23.307]  This abortion craziness and with regards to... Well, let's say the worship of abortion.
[02:24:23.307 --> 02:24:28.308]  The mainline left says it's empowering, it's good, it feels good, it's sexy.
[02:24:28.308 --> 02:24:34.410]  I mean, they're actually, they're admitting what it's real reason is now, is a satanic sacrament.
[02:24:34.410 --> 02:24:35.651]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:24:35.651 --> 02:24:45.394]  And so, in Ezekiel 33, God has pronounced judgment on Jerusalem because of their wickedness, and their wickedness is so
[02:24:46.184 --> 02:24:52.750]  so horrific that God has to pronounce judgment on them, and I think that's what's going on in the United States.
[02:24:52.750 --> 02:24:53.551]  No, that's it.
[02:24:53.551 --> 02:25:02.058]  The devil, the evil spirit knows we can corrupt us, God will remove the hedge of protection, will remove the providence, and we're dead ducks.
[02:25:02.058 --> 02:25:02.839]  No, that's correct.
[02:25:02.839 --> 02:25:13.048]  But so, the point I would want to make today with my call is, you know, when a listener is hearing all of this, it could be easy to get dismayed and
[02:25:13.573 --> 02:25:31.045]  Perhaps start to kind of freak out a little bit, but what God definitely does clearly say in Ezekiel and throughout the Bible is that if you personally turn from your wicked ways and you correct your walk before the Lord, you will live.
[02:25:31.045 --> 02:25:40.191]  And so, yeah, he can exact a hurricane can come through and take out the wicked person that was next door to you in your house, be fine type type of thing.
[02:25:40.191 --> 02:25:40.891]  No, I totally agree.
[02:25:40.891 --> 02:25:43.033]  But listen to me, Mike, I've gotten to the point where
[02:25:44.562 --> 02:25:47.744]  If I get run over when God's taking out a bunch of evil people, I don't care anymore.
[02:25:47.744 --> 02:25:49.085]  You know what, I'm kind of like whatever God wants.
[02:25:49.085 --> 02:25:54.127]  I mean, I'm sure you've gotten to that point in your life, haven't you, where it just, you know, all I'm saying is this.
[02:25:54.127 --> 02:25:55.828]  I'm not questioning God's plan.
[02:25:55.828 --> 02:26:01.972]  I think admitting we're dealing with a bunch of devil worshippers and a spirit of evil is the good news in that it's all real.
[02:26:01.972 --> 02:26:02.532]  God's real.
[02:26:03.092 --> 02:26:04.453]  We have a way to join with God.
[02:26:04.453 --> 02:26:05.834]  I mean, isn't that heavy?
[02:26:05.834 --> 02:26:10.498]  That it's all real world government, Mark of the Beast, the devil worshippers coming for our kids.
[02:26:10.498 --> 02:26:13.020]  It's scary, but at least we have the owner's manual.
[02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:14.261]  At least we know God's right.
[02:26:14.261 --> 02:26:16.162]  That's pretty powerful.
[02:26:16.162 --> 02:26:16.783]  Oh, that's right.
[02:26:16.783 --> 02:26:24.329]  You know, just like yesterday, I read, you know, the UN chief is saying, oh, we have to have open borders and you will listen to us.
[02:26:24.329 --> 02:26:25.209]  We're unelected.
[02:26:25.209 --> 02:26:25.950]  You will listen to us.
[02:26:25.950 --> 02:26:27.251]  It's very satanic.
[02:26:27.251 --> 02:26:28.131]  But you're right.
[02:26:28.131 --> 02:26:31.094]  It's empowering to know that if you walk with God,
[02:26:31.594 --> 02:26:33.596]  It says in the Bible, what can man do to me?
[02:26:33.596 --> 02:26:36.578]  You fear nothing, and I've heard you say that a lot, and God bless you.
[02:26:36.578 --> 02:26:37.840]  That was my point today.
[02:26:37.840 --> 02:26:41.543]  I want to explain, that's not a statement, and you know this.
[02:26:41.543 --> 02:26:45.926]  It's not about getting the fake churches and, oh, I'm holier than thou, I'm not perfect.
[02:26:45.926 --> 02:26:48.929]  Once you really know God, the devil doesn't have any power.
[02:26:48.929 --> 02:26:57.917]  All that evil, you're actually feeling bad you're not doing more in God's presence and the Holy Spirit, you're not fighting the evil more because you know good and evil now.
[02:26:58.377 --> 02:27:03.578]  And you know the score and you can't believe that people don't know God and would choose the devil.
[02:27:03.578 --> 02:27:09.959]  Why would you choose the failure of Hollywood and the evil of the system and the poison of communism?
[02:27:09.959 --> 02:27:11.419]  Because you're godless.
[02:27:11.419 --> 02:27:18.120]  Because you're godless and you're immoral and you worship that and also they have to make the best of their time here on earth.
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:24.302]  When you trust in the Bible, when you trust in God, you realize you're eternal and your time here on earth is the blink of an eye.
[02:27:24.302 --> 02:27:26.842]  You are eternal and then you're not afraid anymore.
[02:27:28.476 --> 02:27:30.359]  You're only afraid of God.
[02:27:30.359 --> 02:27:32.984]  And that doesn't mean God's trying to make you afraid.
[02:27:32.984 --> 02:27:35.769]  It's like when you realize people are scared of the devil, what a joke.
[02:27:35.769 --> 02:27:36.350]  You know God.
[02:27:36.350 --> 02:27:40.858]  You're like, I just don't want to mess this up because it's such an awesome presence.
[02:27:43.232 --> 02:27:43.933]  That's correct.
[02:27:43.933 --> 02:27:44.354]  That's correct.
[02:27:44.354 --> 02:27:55.307]  I mean, you obviously fear God and woe to him who falls into the hands of the living God, and that's what we can also rest assured for all these evil people that are doing all this evil, thinking they're going to get away with it.
[02:27:55.307 --> 02:27:58.852]  Like Johnny Cash says, you know, you can run on for a long time.
[02:27:58.852 --> 02:28:00.354]  Sooner or later, God will cut you down.
[02:28:01.335 --> 02:28:04.077]  Yeah, a lot sooner than later, too.
[02:28:04.077 --> 02:28:05.098]  It's just such folly.
[02:28:05.098 --> 02:28:05.778]  It's so foolish.
[02:28:05.778 --> 02:28:06.279]  God bless you.
[02:28:06.279 --> 02:28:07.059]  I really appreciate your call.
[02:28:07.059 --> 02:28:08.060]  Great points.
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:11.142]  All right, we got Deshaun, Brian, Jeff, Sean, Pat.
[02:28:11.142 --> 02:28:12.283]  I said only seven calls.
[02:28:12.283 --> 02:28:15.625]  I'll never get to them all, and then I feel bad when the show ends and I don't get to them all.
[02:28:15.625 --> 02:28:16.946]  And we've got, who's doing the fourth hour today?
[02:28:16.946 --> 02:28:17.686]  We've got Mike Adams.
[02:28:17.686 --> 02:28:24.431]  I may take one segment of Mike's time, even though Mike's always riveting and informative.
[02:28:24.431 --> 02:28:25.371]  We had no choice.
[02:28:25.371 --> 02:28:29.254]  Trump administration prepares large-scale deportations of illegal aliens amid crisis.
[02:28:30.313 --> 02:28:38.300]  We told you a month ago, and then it was in the news, that Trump is preparing the real national emergency.
[02:28:38.300 --> 02:28:40.041]  And now it's been announced.
[02:28:40.041 --> 02:28:43.524]  It's just, it's very humbling too, to have all the sources we have with the President.
[02:28:43.524 --> 02:28:48.809]  With the President, you know, standing up for Infowars, tweeting us out in the face of all this, five or six times lately.
[02:28:48.809 --> 02:28:50.930]  It's just an amazing time.
[02:28:50.930 --> 02:28:51.871]  Folks, Trump's for real.
[02:28:51.871 --> 02:28:52.572]  Trump's for real.
[02:28:52.572 --> 02:28:53.152]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:53.152 --> 02:28:53.533]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.265 --> 02:28:59.808]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.

[02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:03.631]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.631 --> 02:29:10.195]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.195 --> 02:29:15.279]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:19.982]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.402 --> 02:29:23.523]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[02:31:56.331 --> 02:32:07.397]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[02:32:07.397 --> 02:32:16.282]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[02:32:16.282 --> 02:32:20.265]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[02:32:20.945 --> 02:32:27.428]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[02:32:27.428 --> 02:32:29.588]  And you may be experiencing back up too.

[02:33:21.831 --> 02:33:29.875]  Mike Adams is supposed to be on the fourth hour, but he understands and he's agreed to it and I love him to death.
[02:33:29.875 --> 02:33:31.155]  I'm the health ranger.
[02:33:31.155 --> 02:33:35.497]  I'm going to annex 15 minutes of the hour so I can get to some news that I haven't broken yet.
[02:33:35.497 --> 02:33:37.318]  We have this huge story in loaded phone lines.
[02:33:38.359 --> 02:33:39.080]  We have no choice.
[02:33:39.080 --> 02:33:44.863]  Trump administration prepares large-scale deportations of illegal aliens amid crisis.
[02:33:44.863 --> 02:33:47.365]  I was told by White House sources when I was in D.C.
[02:33:47.365 --> 02:33:53.850]  over a month ago that Trump was going to go with a real national emergency.
[02:33:53.850 --> 02:33:56.531]  Then I saw that on Drudge Report about two weeks ago confirming it.
[02:33:56.531 --> 02:33:58.293]  Well, now the president has done it.
[02:33:58.293 --> 02:34:01.575]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com by Jamie White.
[02:34:01.575 --> 02:34:02.816]  We'll cover it more at the start of the next hour.
[02:34:03.883 --> 02:34:08.484]  Owen went to a secret drag queen story time today.
[02:34:08.484 --> 02:34:10.524]  They've been promoting them all over the Western world.
[02:34:10.524 --> 02:34:12.225]  They launched their attacks about three years ago.
[02:34:12.225 --> 02:34:18.426]  A convicted murderer launched the original group.
[02:34:18.426 --> 02:34:26.567]  We've gotten the reports, it's been confirmed in the news, of multiple busted child rapists right here in Texas, caught running these.
[02:34:26.567 --> 02:34:30.288]  The libraries and public schools do not do a background check, which is
[02:34:31.394 --> 02:34:37.825]  Felony by them in Texas law in other states are similar.
[02:34:37.825 --> 02:34:41.751]  And this time the big story is it was unannounced.
[02:34:41.751 --> 02:34:44.756]  We had a tipster tell us there's already a large story time.
[02:34:45.979 --> 02:34:50.064]  My two-year-old daughter occasionally goes to story times.
[02:34:50.064 --> 02:34:54.128]  She's in a Montessori school part of the time and other things, but she only goes a few days a week.
[02:34:54.128 --> 02:34:55.910]  But I routinely, when I take a day off, take her.
[02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:57.011]  My wife takes her.
[02:34:57.011 --> 02:34:59.954]  Sometimes we have a nanny that takes her to story times.
[02:34:59.954 --> 02:35:02.217]  We took her to a Dr. Seuss story time last week.
[02:35:02.217 --> 02:35:02.717]  My wife did.
[02:35:02.717 --> 02:35:05.440]  It was an hour long at a Westlake
[02:35:07.429 --> 02:35:09.610]  Event at a community library.
[02:35:09.610 --> 02:35:11.171]  Well, guess what?
[02:35:11.171 --> 02:35:25.140]  In the past, they would tell you it was a special drag queen story time, but no one was showing up except convicted pedophiles and a few weirdos to bring their kids up as part of some modern Molokian sacrifice of their innocence to sit on their lap.
[02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:35.047]  This is the big one in the city at one of the big libraries that hundreds of children come to that goes on for four hours every Wednesday.
[02:35:36.826 --> 02:35:40.648]  So this is some pretty sickening, shocking news.
[02:35:40.648 --> 02:35:41.989]  Owen Schroeder got a tip.
[02:35:41.989 --> 02:35:42.470]  He went.
[02:35:42.470 --> 02:35:46.812]  It was not Drag Queen Storytime on the door, on the internet.
[02:35:46.812 --> 02:35:53.236]  They went to see all the regular storytimes, and to meet other kids, and to meet other moms and dads, and, you know, make friends.
[02:35:53.236 --> 02:35:56.658]  That's how a lot of my children met friends they still have today, was at storytimes.
[02:35:56.658 --> 02:35:57.279]  Well, guess what?
[02:35:57.279 --> 02:36:05.143]  You think you're going to hear Dr. Seuss, or you think you're going to see Busytown, Richard Scarry?
[02:36:05.143 --> 02:36:05.344]  No.
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:13.282]  There's going to be a 350 pound man talking about shaking your booty, and you've got to sit on his lap.
[02:36:13.282 --> 02:36:17.483]  He's got a clown makeup on, and if you cry, well, you're going to get in trouble.
[02:36:17.483 --> 02:36:23.325]  So, Ellen, that's our big takeaway, is we're going to show some video in the background and show some of the images you were able to tweet.
[02:36:23.325 --> 02:36:23.865]  This is sick.
[02:36:24.775 --> 02:36:31.063]  Yeah, so basically, the reason why this situation was different, Alex, is because, like you said, I got a tip.
[02:36:31.063 --> 02:36:38.934]  Usually when they have Drag Queen Storytime, they like to promote it on social media, they promote it on whatever library promotions that they're doing as well, and you can find
[02:36:39.775 --> 02:36:43.616]  You know, something, an image or something about it on the internet.
[02:36:43.616 --> 02:36:44.617]  And with this, there was nothing.
[02:36:44.617 --> 02:36:57.461]  All they had was on a whiteboard at the local library that just was a, you know, dry erase board where they put out the typical story times, was Drag Queen story time, and I happened to know somebody that was at that library, so they let me know about it.
[02:36:58.081 --> 02:37:01.863]  And so, you can tell that, you know, this is a local community library here.
[02:37:01.863 --> 02:37:05.366]  The children go there for all kinds of different story times.
[02:37:05.366 --> 02:37:10.049]  That's just what I'm assuming based on the children and the traffic going in and out that I saw.
[02:37:10.049 --> 02:37:11.650]  It seemed like a regular thing.
[02:37:11.650 --> 02:37:18.114]  And so, it also seemed that, based on what they were saying, that they'd never done a Drag Queen story time before there.
[02:37:19.054 --> 02:37:24.556]  And how they want to do it from now on, because the lady I guess that was hosting said, oh, maybe you'll be back next Wednesday.
[02:37:24.556 --> 02:37:26.356]  It was a sneak attack.
[02:37:26.356 --> 02:37:29.217]  So Kitty Litter, Miss Kitty Litter said, oh yeah, I hope.
[02:37:29.217 --> 02:37:30.377]  They all have gross names.
[02:37:30.377 --> 02:37:32.198]  Sally Fish Pants, Kitty Litter.
[02:37:32.198 --> 02:37:33.558]  It's all degrading to women.
[02:37:33.558 --> 02:37:36.299]  Of course, you're showing some of the live stream that's low res.
[02:37:36.299 --> 02:37:37.099]  Guys, show his Twitter.
[02:37:37.099 --> 02:37:39.560]  He's got some HD photos up there.
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:41.820]  Normally, the book is about shaking booty.
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:43.281]  If you're a boy, you could be a girl.
[02:37:43.281 --> 02:37:44.501]  If you're a girl, you could be a boy.
[02:37:44.501 --> 02:37:46.501]  Or were they just priming the pump?
[02:37:46.501 --> 02:37:47.482]  Was it more innocent?
[02:37:47.482 --> 02:37:48.282]  What story was being read?
[02:37:48.582 --> 02:37:50.723]  So, this is actually really interesting, Alex.
[02:37:50.723 --> 02:37:54.225]  Like I said, there's another drag queen story coming up in Leander, Texas.
[02:37:54.225 --> 02:38:01.550]  Because here's the thing, when they announce these things for the public, everybody finds out and then there's a big hoorah and they want to try to stop it.
[02:38:02.284 --> 02:38:04.785]  But with this, it wasn't like that.
[02:38:04.785 --> 02:38:25.834]  So, they basically had the drag queen reading to the children, and you can tell that they had specifically chosen books written by some author that talks about how a red crayon can be blue, and how everything needs to be inclusive, and it's up to you to decide who you are and what you are.
[02:38:25.834 --> 02:38:27.935]  So you can tell that the messaging was strong there.
[02:38:27.935 --> 02:38:30.456]  You could tell that that was the whole purpose.
[02:38:30.456 --> 02:38:30.816]  And again,
[02:38:31.806 --> 02:38:40.610]  To me, it just looked like these parents just bring their kids to story time and, you know, maybe didn't even know what Drag Queen story time was, didn't know what was going on.
[02:38:40.610 --> 02:38:41.510]  Maybe they did.
[02:38:41.510 --> 02:38:42.830]  It didn't really seem that way to me.
[02:38:42.830 --> 02:38:47.652]  It seemed like this was just a one-time thing that nobody really expected.
[02:38:47.652 --> 02:38:52.614]  And then Miss Kitty Litter shows up, she's reading the kids, she's telling them how a red crayon can be blue.
[02:38:52.614 --> 02:38:55.255]  And here's another thing they do, Alex, you know all about this.
[02:38:55.255 --> 02:39:00.077]  It's crazy, because you used to talk about this, but it's true, how they use ice cream in their propaganda.
[02:39:00.077 --> 02:39:01.638]  They did a story about how you can stack
[02:39:01.758 --> 02:39:06.381]  Different color ice creams together and change it around as a drag queen is right there.
[02:39:06.381 --> 02:39:09.844]  So it's normalizing it, making the kids think of ice cream and drag queens.
[02:39:09.844 --> 02:39:13.506]  It's Pavlovian and we can show the footage of the drag queen storytime to other areas.
[02:39:13.506 --> 02:39:14.487]  Run by convicted pedophiles.
[02:39:14.487 --> 02:39:21.892]  We can show footage of men shagging their butts with small children putting money in their g-strings and then a letter came out, convicted pedophiles weren't these events.
[02:39:22.512 --> 02:39:32.015]  So we don't know about this particular new event and what was going on, but again, this is creepy men dressed like women or clowns, really, showing up and talking to children.
[02:39:32.015 --> 02:39:49.261]  Well, and when I mentioned a background check and what happened in Houston afterwards, they seemed shocked about it, and I was actually able to get Miss Kitty Litter's official name, so I'm not sure if the library did a background check, but we've also found a video that she's featured in, so... By the way, these are hideous-looking people.
[02:39:49.901 --> 02:39:55.462]  I mean, on anywhere you'd go, you would think this is a psychotic, a lunatic, they're always obese men in clown outfits.
[02:39:55.462 --> 02:39:57.863]  I mean, this is like an army.
[02:39:57.863 --> 02:40:02.683]  If an army of It The Clowns invaded, this is what I would expect to see.
[02:40:02.683 --> 02:40:09.025]  Can we roll the footage, by the way, that Millie Weaver shot, just a drag queen event here in Austin with the small children?
[02:40:09.025 --> 02:40:11.565]  Because that's the most critical for people to see.
[02:40:11.565 --> 02:40:14.366]  That's what I want to show people, because TV viewers are seeing this.
[02:40:14.366 --> 02:40:15.706]  They need to know what's going on.
[02:40:17.606 --> 02:40:21.168]  Most people, I think, didn't believe that this stuff is going on until they actually see it.
[02:40:21.168 --> 02:40:26.632]  And you just ask yourself, I think just the average person, let's not even politicize things, it's just like, why?
[02:40:26.632 --> 02:40:28.092]  Why do you have drag queens?
[02:40:28.092 --> 02:40:30.674]  And again, it's all over the world it's happening.
[02:40:30.674 --> 02:40:36.718]  It's men in so much makeup, it's camouflage, because you learn a bunch of them are convicted child rapists!
[02:40:37.538 --> 02:40:41.001]  And again, these places are not doing background checks.
[02:40:41.001 --> 02:40:49.507]  And I even went there today just to document it, just to see the whole thing, and I waited for the kids to leave before I started talking to Miss Kitty Litter.
[02:40:49.507 --> 02:40:54.992]  And then what do you know, the library representatives, as soon as I asked her a question, said, oh, are you allowed to film in here?
[02:40:54.992 --> 02:40:55.852]  Can you film here?
[02:40:55.852 --> 02:40:57.814]  I was filming the whole time, other parents were filming too.
[02:40:59.936 --> 02:41:03.821]  They know that what they're doing has some moral questions.
[02:41:03.821 --> 02:41:04.722]  They know it.
[02:41:04.722 --> 02:41:08.467]  And as soon as they think that you might think that too, you can tell that they get panicked.
[02:41:08.467 --> 02:41:09.488]  I wasn't even making a scene.
[02:41:09.488 --> 02:41:17.478]  Like I said, I waited for the kids to leave before I asked this individual his real name and, you know, if they'd heard about what happened in Houston with the...
[02:41:18.519 --> 02:41:19.240]  And what did he say?
[02:41:32.441 --> 02:41:34.202]  And that's when he gave me his full name.
[02:41:34.202 --> 02:41:36.443]  I think it was David Lee Robinson or something.
[02:41:36.443 --> 02:41:38.184]  It's on film.
[02:41:38.184 --> 02:41:39.645]  So this was Alex, here's the name.
[02:41:39.645 --> 02:41:43.347]  This was kind of a light one, just to kind of grease the skids.
[02:41:43.347 --> 02:41:46.808]  I mean, you know, it wasn't like one of these ones where they have the kids bouncing on people's laps.
[02:41:46.808 --> 02:41:47.649]  No, this is just a light one.
[02:41:47.649 --> 02:41:51.110]  We have men in dresses, talking about sex.
[02:41:51.110 --> 02:41:57.794]  I mean, if you were at the park, and a dude walks up in a clown outfit and says, I want to talk to your kids, you'd say, get the hell away.
[02:41:57.794 --> 02:42:01.316]  But instead, the government does it, so we bring the children to them like offerings.
[02:42:01.316 --> 02:42:01.816]  No, that's it.
[02:42:02.276 --> 02:42:10.620]  If somebody comes up to your kid, dressed in drag at the park, and says, hey little Johnny, I just want you to know that you can be anything you think you are.
[02:42:10.620 --> 02:42:13.141]  And I've got over here... A red crayon can be blue.
[02:42:13.141 --> 02:42:14.322]  You can float too.
[02:42:14.322 --> 02:42:16.243]  And then ice cream... There's ice cream down there.
[02:42:16.243 --> 02:42:21.365]  You can mix ice cream flavors and colors and... Just get in the back of the van.
[02:42:21.365 --> 02:42:22.305]  It's all about what's on the inside.
[02:42:22.305 --> 02:42:22.966]  I want to see three colors.
[02:42:22.966 --> 02:42:25.707]  It's what's on the inside, Johnny.
[02:42:25.707 --> 02:42:27.188]  You'd say, okay, no, that's messed up.
[02:42:27.188 --> 02:42:31.770]  You know, you're going to see... I've got a castle and Brian Stelter lives there.
[02:42:32.725 --> 02:42:34.006]  We all float in the end!
[02:42:55.686 --> 02:42:57.007]  Shut down our speech!
[02:42:57.007 --> 02:43:02.531]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[02:43:02.531 --> 02:43:10.016]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[02:43:10.016 --> 02:43:11.337]  Are you coming back?
[02:43:11.337 --> 02:43:12.438]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[02:43:13.078 --> 02:43:14.459]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[02:43:14.459 --> 02:43:16.701]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.news.
[02:43:16.701 --> 02:43:18.702]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[02:43:18.702 --> 02:43:23.466]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[02:43:23.466 --> 02:43:25.727]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:43:25.727 --> 02:43:30.611]  InfoWars.com, man!
[02:43:30.611 --> 02:43:30.671]  Woo!
[02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:35.123]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[02:43:35.123 --> 02:43:36.664]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[02:43:36.664 --> 02:43:39.267]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:43:39.267 --> 02:43:41.609]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[02:43:41.609 --> 02:43:45.112]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[02:43:45.112 --> 02:43:47.855]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[02:43:47.855 --> 02:43:50.137]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:43:50.137 --> 02:43:51.138]  That's where they find it.
[02:43:51.138 --> 02:43:52.939]  You know, there's things called websites.
[02:43:52.939 --> 02:43:53.520]  They just go there.
[02:43:56.167 --> 02:44:03.575]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history.
[02:44:03.575 --> 02:44:07.860]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[02:44:07.860 --> 02:44:11.584]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:18.951]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[02:44:18.951 --> 02:44:20.171]  This is racketeering.
[02:44:20.171 --> 02:44:21.272]  This is cartels.
[02:44:21.272 --> 02:44:23.713]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[02:44:23.713 --> 02:44:25.574]  We need it now.
[02:44:25.574 --> 02:44:27.275]  You can take on Big Ten.
[02:44:27.275 --> 02:44:36.219]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[02:44:36.219 --> 02:44:44.262]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[02:44:44.262 --> 02:44:45.103]  The way to fight back
[02:44:45.723 --> 02:44:50.587]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[02:44:50.587 --> 02:44:56.291]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[02:44:56.291 --> 02:45:00.474]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:45:00.474 --> 02:45:01.535]  They are technocrats.
[02:45:01.535 --> 02:45:03.837]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:45:03.837 --> 02:45:11.183]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:45:11.183 --> 02:45:13.064]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:45:13.064 --> 02:45:15.166]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:45:15.666 --> 02:45:22.009]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:45:22.009 --> 02:45:27.191]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:45:27.191 --> 02:45:36.216]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality medical bottlemen and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:45:37.176 --> 02:45:43.161]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[02:45:43.161 --> 02:45:44.101]  It is amazing.
[02:45:44.101 --> 02:45:54.109]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the Second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:45:56.827 --> 02:46:04.910]  Our powerful line of fluoride-free products is the perfect gift for yourself or others who are exploring a healthier, happier lifestyle.
[02:46:04.910 --> 02:46:10.473]  With options ranging from toothpaste to oral spray, it's easy to find the perfect option for you.
[02:46:10.473 --> 02:46:16.675]  Super Blue Toothpaste is the fan-favorite fluoride-free toothpaste that every info-warrior loves.
[02:46:16.675 --> 02:46:18.716]  Powered by iodine and nano-silver,
[02:46:19.016 --> 02:46:24.017]  It's designed to deliver a powerful clean while supporting good oral health and fresh breath.
[02:46:24.017 --> 02:46:26.158]  Available in two refreshing flavors.
[02:46:26.158 --> 02:46:31.019]  Enjoy a minty fresh flavor made with peppermint oil or try our bubblegum flavor.
[02:46:31.019 --> 02:46:36.381]  Super Blue Immune Gargle is the only option for on-the-go immune system support like no other.
[02:46:36.641 --> 02:46:38.362]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:13.599 --> 02:47:19.122]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:47:19.122 --> 02:47:22.864]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:47:22.864 --> 02:47:25.766]  Run on for a long time.
[02:47:25.766 --> 02:47:28.648]  Run on for a long time.
[02:47:28.648 --> 02:47:31.709]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[02:47:31.709 --> 02:47:34.091]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[02:47:36.564 --> 02:47:50.672]  That's one thing I've learned about the devil.
[02:47:50.672 --> 02:47:52.593]  About his minions, about evil.
[02:47:52.593 --> 02:47:54.054]  It's a program, they all act the same.
[02:47:54.054 --> 02:47:58.216]  There are different permutations of attacks, the same playbook.
[02:47:58.216 --> 02:48:00.057]  And they always think one-dimensional.
[02:48:01.064 --> 02:48:09.387]  The higher level ones may be two-dimensional sometimes, but they never think third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth out.
[02:48:09.387 --> 02:48:11.788]  They just can't do it.
[02:48:11.788 --> 02:48:19.351]  And they always think they're winning up front, until the next domino starts to fall.
[02:48:19.351 --> 02:48:28.835]  And as soon as those dominoes start falling, they just double down, which greases the skids on their express elevator to hell even faster.
[02:48:30.162 --> 02:48:33.203]  Well, I got word a month ago that Trump is going to declare the Insurrection Act.
[02:48:33.203 --> 02:48:40.886]  It's a real, full-blown national emergency of the type that the President can declare when the border is under attack.
[02:48:40.886 --> 02:48:45.008]  And now, today, it's being announced that he's going there.
[02:48:45.008 --> 02:48:50.770]  Trump plans to invoke the Insurrection Act to boost and to boot illegal immigrants.
[02:48:50.770 --> 02:48:53.952]  This hasn't been done since Eisenhower did it.
[02:48:53.952 --> 02:48:58.673]  So, Mexico rounds your ass up if you're there illegally and throws you out.
[02:48:58.673 --> 02:48:59.914]  I'm all for you if you're here legally.
[02:49:00.865 --> 02:49:02.406]  This is important, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:02.406 --> 02:49:03.466]  Our country's under crisis.
[02:49:03.466 --> 02:49:06.947]  We're going to go to your phone calls with Owen Schroyer.
[02:49:06.947 --> 02:49:21.532]  But Owen, finishing up on Drag Queen Storytime, the story here is, unannounced, just like they did in Denver and a bunch of other places, they have Career Day with elementary students, and then a man in a dress shows up and says, I'm a dancer at a gay club.
[02:49:21.532 --> 02:49:24.973]  It'd be a great business for you to dress as a woman and work at a gay bar.
[02:49:26.314 --> 02:49:30.759]  I mean, I wouldn't want, and it's not like I'm virtue signaling at the, quote, gay people.
[02:49:30.759 --> 02:49:36.404]  Like, I wouldn't want, I mean, seriously, imagine they had Portia there, 25-year-old topless dancer.
[02:49:36.404 --> 02:49:39.627]  She's like, oh, little girls, I'd dance over at the Cheetah.
[02:49:40.762 --> 02:49:49.827]  Or I dance over at Triple X, or whatever the name is, at the men's club, and you know, I give blowjobs in the champagne room, and I'm making $300,000 a year, and I'm really a hooker.
[02:49:49.827 --> 02:49:53.689]  You know, sweetheart, you can make a lot of money, and I'm sorry to talk like this on air.
[02:49:53.689 --> 02:49:55.010]  Here's the deal.
[02:49:55.010 --> 02:50:00.493]  I've been on the air 25 years, and I've only started talking like that some now because your children are being taught it!
[02:50:01.431 --> 02:50:02.912]  You think?
[02:50:02.912 --> 02:50:07.193]  And again, I don't care if it's a topless dancer or a dude in a damn dress.
[02:50:07.193 --> 02:50:13.055]  Stay the hell away from our children, you perverts!
[02:50:13.055 --> 02:50:13.896]  It doesn't matter now.
[02:50:13.896 --> 02:50:15.977]  I mean, people are freaked out.
[02:50:15.977 --> 02:50:18.337]  There's like 15 Netflix shows.
[02:50:18.337 --> 02:50:19.498]  Oh, and I can't keep track of them now.
[02:50:20.854 --> 02:50:29.780]  About sexualizing kids and men having sex with 10-year-old girls and how great it is and like, you know, it's just like, you know, we know Roman Polanski's into this type of stuff.
[02:50:29.780 --> 02:50:31.281]  I got three daughters.
[02:50:31.281 --> 02:50:33.002]  And let me tell you something.
[02:50:33.002 --> 02:50:35.843]  You get around my 13-year-old daughter, you're gonna get your neck broken.
[02:50:35.843 --> 02:50:37.064]  And it's not a threat, man.
[02:50:37.064 --> 02:50:40.046]  Get it through your brain.
[02:50:40.046 --> 02:50:43.488]  Leave our children alone, you psychic vampires.
[02:50:43.488 --> 02:50:47.871]  Here's what people need to understand about where we're at as a society and a culture right now.
[02:50:49.428 --> 02:51:01.402]  There is momentum going right now towards pedophilia and towards sexualizing children and towards indoctrinating them into this 76 gender be whatever you think you are type of thing.
[02:51:01.402 --> 02:51:03.924]  Lop off your, you know, private part.
[02:51:03.924 --> 02:51:07.068]  That's to cover all the confusions to cover for the agenda to get kids.
[02:51:07.188 --> 02:51:16.016]  And if there is nothing to stop it, if there's nothing to stop the momentum, if nothing gets in the way of this agenda, it will be completed.
[02:51:16.016 --> 02:51:17.618]  That's what momentum does.
[02:51:17.618 --> 02:51:19.059]  So there's momentum going right now.
[02:51:19.059 --> 02:51:20.681]  That's right, it's a giant wave!
[02:51:20.681 --> 02:51:24.804]  So if we don't stop it, or if somebody doesn't get in the way, then we know where this goes.
[02:51:24.804 --> 02:51:25.946]  It will complete itself.
[02:51:25.946 --> 02:51:32.592]  But Alex, this is why they can't announce it to the public anymore, because there's so much public outcry when they announce this Drag Queen Story Time.
[02:51:33.032 --> 02:51:39.200]  That they ultimately either have to cancel it or... And by the way, these individuals all follow central orders, central scripts.
[02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:44.487]  They are priests of this new system where they're testing the perch with your children.
[02:51:45.379 --> 02:51:48.341]  So, coming up in 10 days, there's another Drag Queen Storytime.
[02:51:48.341 --> 02:51:50.603]  They said, they said, we're grooming your children!
[02:51:50.603 --> 02:51:57.168]  They say it on news, but there's another one in 10 days in Leander, and they announced this, the public said, no, we don't want it.
[02:51:57.168 --> 02:52:02.152]  A private church then rented out a room at the library so that they could still have the event, so.
[02:52:02.152 --> 02:52:04.874]  A church, some captured leftist run church.
[02:52:05.194 --> 02:52:07.797]  And so, yes, I forget the name of it right now.
[02:52:07.797 --> 02:52:11.740]  You could probably find it real easy if you search Leander Drag Queen Storytime.
[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:14.483]  Yeah, and it's totally one of the leftist Catholic churches, Alex.
[02:52:14.483 --> 02:52:15.744]  You know that they're around here.
[02:52:15.744 --> 02:52:20.549]  And so, there's probably going to be more people out there protesting this deal than there are people that actually want to attend it.
[02:52:20.549 --> 02:52:23.252]  But see, it's all about the agenda.
[02:52:23.252 --> 02:52:27.756]  It's all about... Oh my God, you ought to go to like the First Methodist or something, like 20 years ago.
[02:52:27.756 --> 02:52:28.317]  Oh, I've been there.
[02:52:28.757 --> 02:52:32.799]  Yeah, I actually went to an event at First Methodist, the one you're talking about down here.
[02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:56.316]  They were talking about some border issues with some Texas state congressmen and I just asked a question and they all got mad at me.
[02:52:56.316 --> 02:52:59.059]  And I just asked a question and then they ended up chasing me out of there.
[02:52:59.059 --> 02:53:00.941]  Oh, that's like the elitist of Austin.
[02:53:00.941 --> 02:53:01.922]  But you can see it.
[02:53:01.922 --> 02:53:03.003]  I mean, that's the crazy thing, Alex.
[02:53:03.003 --> 02:53:03.904]  You know, we were talking about this.
[02:53:05.225 --> 02:53:07.147]  Where are all the Christians?
[02:53:07.147 --> 02:53:08.408]  You know why I know about it?
[02:53:08.408 --> 02:53:12.671]  Because my mom used to go there when she was a little kid.
[02:53:12.671 --> 02:53:15.393]  Her parents were like Baptists.
[02:53:15.393 --> 02:53:16.775]  They go to the Baptist Church.
[02:53:16.775 --> 02:53:18.916]  But sometimes she'd go to the First Methodist.
[02:53:18.916 --> 02:53:20.458]  I would go there when I was a teenager.
[02:53:21.118 --> 02:53:21.338]  I think
[02:53:36.015 --> 02:53:38.177]  I think people just need to ask themselves a simple question.
[02:53:38.177 --> 02:53:40.438]  Why would you have Drag Queen Storytime?
[02:53:40.438 --> 02:53:40.678]  Why?
[02:53:40.678 --> 02:53:41.679]  What is the purpose?
[02:53:41.679 --> 02:53:44.261]  Why would Snapchat have a filter that says love has no age?
[02:53:44.261 --> 02:53:49.004]  Why would that become a marketing ploy for Pride Month here in 2019?
[02:53:49.004 --> 02:53:50.565]  Why is all this going on?
[02:53:50.565 --> 02:53:52.267]  That's what people need to start asking themselves.
[02:53:52.267 --> 02:53:56.450]  And where are Christians that are supposed to be the ones standing in the way of this?
[02:53:56.450 --> 02:53:57.550]  Where are the Christians out there?
[02:53:57.550 --> 02:53:58.491]  Where are the moral people?
[02:53:58.491 --> 02:53:59.452]  Where are the modest people?
[02:53:59.452 --> 02:54:00.933]  No, they all just capitulate.
[02:54:00.933 --> 02:54:01.373]  Capitulate.
[02:54:01.373 --> 02:54:02.374]  We're going to go to some phone calls.
[02:54:03.846 --> 02:54:09.628]  And then we're going to get into a bunch of the, this new contest has been so successful that I haven't talked about because I've been so busy, but it's amazing.
[02:54:09.628 --> 02:54:11.308]  And I salute everybody that's entered the contest.
[02:54:11.308 --> 02:54:15.369]  We're going to show some of the activism on the street coming up that Mike Adams takes over.
[02:54:15.369 --> 02:54:17.069]  Oh, and you're going to be covering this in the War Room, right?
[02:54:17.069 --> 02:54:18.370]  Shotgun on this right now.
[02:54:18.370 --> 02:54:24.211]  War Room is in an hour and six minutes at Infowars.com forward slash show and hopefully on stations picking up this show.
[02:54:24.211 --> 02:54:26.052]  A lot of stations are picking up his show, so do it.
[02:54:26.052 --> 02:54:26.492]  It's powerful.
[02:54:27.824 --> 02:54:28.064]  I don't know.
[02:54:49.403 --> 02:54:53.586]  So Tim Ferruchet comes over two days ago and he goes, listen, you gotta get a new special, okay?
[02:54:53.586 --> 02:54:56.108]  Okay, so I said, well, what do you think it ought to be?
[02:54:56.108 --> 02:55:02.794]  And he goes, I don't know, we've got a bunch of stuff with Force in the name, and of our top ten products, half of them are Force products.
[02:55:03.823 --> 02:55:11.269]  Names I came up with Turbo Force, Brain Force, DNA Force was amazing, Ultimate Female Force.
[02:55:11.269 --> 02:55:16.293]  That's all 50% off in the total Super Force special sale.
[02:55:16.293 --> 02:55:21.456]  So it's a total Super Force because it's all of the Force specials.
[02:55:21.456 --> 02:55:26.761]  And 33% off the Space Force America's Back designer t-shirt because
[02:55:27.924 --> 02:55:29.205]  The t-shirt cost me $9.
[02:55:29.205 --> 02:55:41.597]  It's soft fabric, made in America, printed in America, and then the printing in this deep color, red, white, and blue flag, and the space shuttle with a new design in 1776.
[02:55:41.597 --> 02:55:44.941]  People love that shirt I was wearing, so we redesigned an original NASA design.
[02:55:44.941 --> 02:55:46.802]  This sucker is popular.
[02:55:46.802 --> 02:55:47.343]  It is now $19.95.
[02:55:47.343 --> 02:55:50.326]  Let me explain something.
[02:55:50.326 --> 02:55:51.547]  At that price, we're making $5 a shirt.
[02:55:53.355 --> 02:55:55.196]  And I used to sell shirts sometimes at cost.
[02:55:55.196 --> 02:55:58.157]  People say, how did you sell 100,000 Hillary for prison shirts?
[02:55:58.157 --> 02:55:59.458]  Most of them were sold at $5.
[02:55:59.458 --> 02:56:07.581]  That was a cheap shirt, you know, easy to print, you know, kind of felt scratchy, whatever, but people wanted the cheap one because you got out there and it was great.
[02:56:07.581 --> 02:56:08.941]  100,000 of those babies hit the streets.
[02:56:08.941 --> 02:56:09.862]  Caused a phenomenon.
[02:56:09.862 --> 02:56:11.642]  Millions of others got printed by others.
[02:56:11.642 --> 02:56:12.823]  I even talked to Trump about that one time.
[02:56:12.823 --> 02:56:16.704]  He's like, yeah, I've seen the numbers on that shirt, but that's a side issue.
[02:56:16.704 --> 02:56:17.565]  I never told that story.
[02:56:17.565 --> 02:56:18.125]  I shouldn't tell that.
[02:56:18.445 --> 02:56:23.969]  Anyways, the point is that this, I believe, will be the new shirt.
[02:56:23.969 --> 02:56:25.491]  But it's super soft.
[02:56:25.491 --> 02:56:27.072]  It's a really expensive fabric.
[02:56:27.072 --> 02:56:28.373]  It's like a mix.
[02:56:28.373 --> 02:56:29.794]  And it's just beautiful.
[02:56:29.794 --> 02:56:30.795]  And we're very proud of it.
[02:56:30.795 --> 02:56:32.636]  It's 33% off, $19.95.
[02:56:32.636 --> 02:56:36.679]  And it's available at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:56:36.679 --> 02:56:43.465]  DNA Force, folks, has PQQ CoQ10 of the highest quality types that are actually absorbable and aren't synthetic.
[02:56:44.105 --> 02:56:47.027]  Okay, so the average supplements marked up seven times.
[02:56:47.027 --> 02:56:48.728]  We mark ours up 150%.
[02:56:48.728 --> 02:56:51.009]  We always discount a quarter.
[02:56:51.009 --> 02:56:51.669]  So we mark up 100%.
[02:56:51.669 --> 02:56:59.134]  So people are like, oh my God, you're putting how much product in here?
[02:56:59.134 --> 02:57:06.278]  Back when we sold DNA Force for 150 bucks, we were putting $60 in product in it and then discounting it.
[02:57:06.278 --> 02:57:12.722]  I signed a multi-year contract and I put a lot of money down so I can get it for less.
[02:57:13.829 --> 02:57:18.552]  And, but, at 50% off, ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat it for yourself, your family, everybody else.

[02:57:27.738 --> 02:57:30.940]  DNA Force Plus!
[02:57:30.940 --> 02:57:36.985]  I can't even go into all it does in the time we have here, but let's just say this.
[02:57:36.985 --> 02:57:40.827]  It's incredible what it does for your cells, your body, for everything.
[02:57:40.827 --> 02:57:42.328]  Your nerves, your bones.

[02:57:42.968 --> 02:57:43.309]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.174 --> 02:57:48.777]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.777 --> 02:57:50.539]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.539 --> 02:58:01.828]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.589 --> 02:58:11.792]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.792 --> 02:58:17.754]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:58:17.754 --> 02:58:22.836]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.836 --> 02:58:25.457]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.457 --> 02:58:27.157]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.157 --> 02:58:31.979]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[02:58:32.199 --> 02:58:37.164]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.164 --> 02:58:39.807]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.807 --> 02:58:44.512]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[02:58:46.112 --> 02:58:47.433]  It's time.

[02:58:50.454 --> 02:58:53.015]  The power that God gave us through Mother Nature.

[02:59:42.641 --> 02:59:48.745]  You'll find these amazing specials at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:59:48.745 --> 02:59:59.112]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.112 --> 03:00:00.834]  Alright, it's hour four.
[03:00:00.834 --> 03:00:01.934]  Mike Adams has taken over.
[03:00:01.934 --> 03:00:04.836]  I've got a few of these videos that have entered this contest that are powerful.
[03:00:04.836 --> 03:00:06.878]  I'm going to play in the next segment.
[03:00:08.254 --> 03:00:11.297]  The full list of the entries that are amazing is up on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:11.297 --> 03:00:16.423]  The latest is Watch Polar Bear Rips Al Gore Global Warming Alarmist.
[03:00:16.423 --> 03:00:17.324]  It needs to go viral.
[03:00:17.324 --> 03:00:20.087]  There's a bunch of other entries on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:20.087 --> 03:00:21.168]  These folks are doing a great job.
[03:00:21.168 --> 03:00:22.950]  Please go check out these videos.
[03:00:22.950 --> 03:00:25.473]  Okay, let's go to your calls here.
[03:00:25.473 --> 03:00:26.153]  Let's go to...
[03:00:27.998 --> 03:00:35.484]  Deshwan, if I'm saying that right, in California, the genocide of the American patriot through the leftist goals, which they admit is their plan.
[03:00:35.484 --> 03:00:41.829]  They say, in masculinity, in women, in the family, and it's placed giant fat men wearing clown outfits will rule our children.
[03:00:41.829 --> 03:00:43.350]  Go ahead.
[03:00:43.350 --> 03:00:45.071]  I'm going to be real blunt with you, man.
[03:00:45.071 --> 03:00:46.952]  I'm just going to tell you how it is.
[03:00:46.952 --> 03:00:50.995]  They're going for the genocide of the white American patriot.
[03:00:50.995 --> 03:00:56.660]  And like I said, I don't understand how the white man got tricked into going overseas
[03:00:57.338 --> 03:00:59.400]  No, no, no, they're going after yours, man.
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:00.742]  This is your war.
[03:01:19.603 --> 03:01:21.525]  A lot of us don't know what's going on.
[03:01:21.525 --> 03:01:22.526]  Y'all do.
[03:01:22.526 --> 03:01:24.508]  That's why we've been educated, period.
[03:01:24.508 --> 03:01:28.751]  But, like I said, y'all been giving us the register of know y'all guns.
[03:01:28.751 --> 03:01:31.013]  I don't know how they tricked us into doing that.
[03:01:31.013 --> 03:01:32.274]  It's unbelievable.
[03:01:32.274 --> 03:01:33.796]  They're coming for us.
[03:01:33.796 --> 03:01:38.920]  And like I said, like Lou Dobbs said last night, the Republican Party is now a Democrat.
[03:01:38.920 --> 03:01:41.723]  They are selling us out right on TV.
[03:01:41.723 --> 03:01:44.245]  And the reason they ain't locked up is because they white.
[03:01:45.029 --> 03:01:46.930]  If they was black, they would be a lot tougher.
[03:01:46.930 --> 03:01:51.873]  Well, no, that's actually true that, uh, is it most of this pedophile stuff?
[03:01:51.873 --> 03:01:52.794]  I'm not bashing white people.
[03:01:52.794 --> 03:01:53.774]  It's true.
[03:01:53.774 --> 03:01:54.635]  There is something wrong.
[03:01:54.635 --> 03:01:55.775]  Well, there's something wrong.
[03:01:55.775 --> 03:02:03.420]  Let's say there's a lot of good white people, but there's something wrong in the mental illness and the drag queen stuff and the pedophilia.
[03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:06.502]  And it is predominantly white liberals are pushing the race war.
[03:02:06.502 --> 03:02:08.203]  They're pushing the devil worship.
[03:02:08.203 --> 03:02:10.024]  What do you think it is, uh, Deshawn?
[03:02:12.993 --> 03:02:17.456]  We know the orders are coming from the Queen of England and that's what it is.
[03:02:17.456 --> 03:02:21.058]  They took over the political system.
[03:02:21.058 --> 03:02:22.298]  They got the military.
[03:02:22.298 --> 03:02:26.161]  Just imagine how many military men at the top hate their own race.
[03:02:26.161 --> 03:02:26.941]  That's crazy.
[03:02:26.941 --> 03:02:32.484]  I remember when we heard Nancy Pelosi say that she wished her kids had brown eyes and black hair.
[03:02:32.484 --> 03:02:34.245]  Who would ever say that about their own race?
[03:02:34.878 --> 03:02:40.042]  Okay, these people literally want to kill themselves off, and Hillary is the head honcho of it.
[03:02:40.042 --> 03:02:43.725]  She's going for the conversation, the door-to-door.
[03:02:43.725 --> 03:02:46.327]  They're watching us through these TVs, period, man.
[03:02:46.327 --> 03:02:48.588]  They are coming for the genocide of the white race.
[03:02:48.588 --> 03:02:51.731]  That's why they don't want the no-fly zone and everything on y'all.
[03:02:51.731 --> 03:02:53.352]  And the camp's just ready, man.
[03:02:53.352 --> 03:02:58.416]  And they're using the other race to mount them up and come after y'all.
[03:02:58.416 --> 03:03:02.479]  Well, I think they are planning a race war, and they're trying to stir white people up.
[03:03:03.191 --> 03:03:04.414]  But that's a good point.
[03:03:04.414 --> 03:03:05.155]  I appreciate your call.
[03:03:05.155 --> 03:03:14.035]  It is really true that you turn on leftist media, and it's like the KKK, but it's against white people, and it's being pushed by crazy white people.
[03:03:15.145 --> 03:03:27.189]  Well, and I did a social experiment the other day just to see, because you have all these leftists tweeting out racist things against white people that just gets ignored, and you say, well, wow, if you would replace that with black or brown people, you know, what would happen?
[03:03:27.189 --> 03:03:33.071]  Well, if you use their exact terminology, if you use their exact weapon against them, you become untouchable.
[03:03:33.071 --> 03:03:35.912]  I've actually learned that just here recently.
[03:03:35.912 --> 03:03:37.533]  It's like throwing milkshakes.
[03:03:37.533 --> 03:03:41.474]  Like, if we go out and start throwing milkshakes at Democrats, not saying we should do that.
[03:03:42.213 --> 03:03:43.435]  No, but I've thought about that.
[03:03:43.435 --> 03:03:44.697]  Plus, I don't want to get arrested.
[03:03:44.697 --> 03:03:45.958]  But I mean, just to make the point...
[03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:49.341]  Are they going to decry it if I start throwing milkshakes on Democrats?
[03:03:49.341 --> 03:03:50.342]  Exactly.
[03:03:50.342 --> 03:03:58.867]  You take their exact... I took an exact tweet from this girl, Sarah Rial, that said, you know, why shouldn't she hate white people?
[03:03:58.867 --> 03:04:06.191]  And luckily, you know, the InfoWars audience of people are smart enough and informed enough to understand when I'm putting out a social experiment, a troll tweet, so they know I'm not racist.
[03:04:06.191 --> 03:04:13.535]  But I replaced white with black, white with brown, white with Muslim, just to see if I'd get banned, and to see if they'd write stories about me being racist.
[03:04:13.535 --> 03:04:14.335]  They didn't say a word!
[03:04:14.335 --> 03:04:14.755]  Sure, but I...
[03:04:16.056 --> 03:04:19.677]  I'm not virtually signaling at brown people saying this.
[03:04:19.677 --> 03:04:21.177]  I just say what I see.
[03:04:21.177 --> 03:04:29.999]  It's mainly weirdo white people, and some Asians they've gotten on board, like the New York Times board member, that literally run around trying to stir up minorities to be racist.
[03:04:29.999 --> 03:04:33.440]  I've actually seen the response of a lot of minorities are like, this is crazy, we don't agree with this.
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:34.920]  It's classic projection, Alex.
[03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:38.381]  They're really... What I'm saying is I don't think it's working with most minorities.
[03:04:38.381 --> 03:04:41.782]  Well, most minorities just are sick of being called a victim, I think.
[03:04:42.671 --> 03:04:43.772]  They're just like, no, I'm fine.
[03:04:43.772 --> 03:04:45.032]  What do you want?
[03:04:45.032 --> 03:04:49.395]  But I'll tell you who it is working on is the minorities and white people at the colleges.
[03:04:49.395 --> 03:04:50.335]  It's working there.
[03:04:50.335 --> 03:04:50.896]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:50.896 --> 03:04:51.216]  Stay with us.

[03:06:08.736 --> 03:06:11.578]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[03:06:11.578 --> 03:06:18.041]  That gentleman who just called in...
[03:06:34.738 --> 03:06:36.302]  Was saying what's going on with you white people?
[03:06:36.302 --> 03:06:39.670]  Letting everybody say kill you everywhere.
[03:06:39.670 --> 03:06:42.958]  And I found it's had an effect on...
[03:06:44.224 --> 03:06:59.788]  Black Americans, particularly Hispanic Americans and others who just want to live a life and be left alone and get along with their white neighbor and they know this is all bull, but they're like going, hey, what's going on with all the white people saying white people are the devil and all these Democratic Party people saying, yeah, white people suck and we've got everything and white people don't know what it's like to be poor?
[03:06:59.788 --> 03:07:02.969]  Anybody who lives in the real world knows that's a load of crap.
[03:07:02.969 --> 03:07:09.590]  Nothing against Asians, Asians are great people, but the nine richest groups in America, by demographic, are Asian groups.
[03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:11.050]  And then it's white people under that.
[03:07:11.050 --> 03:07:12.851]  Most homeless in Austin are white people.
[03:07:13.536 --> 03:07:14.556]  Yeah, it's just crazy.
[03:07:14.556 --> 03:07:30.240]  So, I don't think the propaganda the left's putting out that we need to get rid of all the white people's working, because the average person's like, well, I'm married to a white person, or I live next door to a white person that's nice, or they're just people like them that can't pay their bills, and it is weird.
[03:07:30.240 --> 03:07:31.320]  But, I mean, where do you think it's going?
[03:07:31.320 --> 03:07:32.381]  I'm going to take a few more calls.
[03:07:34.249 --> 03:07:40.091]  They thought they had their Civil War revved up and ready to go, and Smollett was going to be the powder keg.
[03:07:40.091 --> 03:07:40.691]  Oh, exactly.
[03:07:40.691 --> 03:07:41.732]  And they failed.
[03:07:41.732 --> 03:07:42.852]  So they may try to drum something up.
[03:07:42.852 --> 03:07:47.114]  Oh, and they've released now the text messages where he was buying drugs and openly planning it all.
[03:07:47.114 --> 03:07:48.414]  I mean, he's caught red-handed.
[03:07:48.414 --> 03:07:49.014]  Let's be honest.
[03:07:49.014 --> 03:07:50.355]  He was radicalized by Obama.
[03:07:50.715 --> 03:07:54.337]  And if they did a full-on investigation they would probably find that that was the case.
[03:07:54.337 --> 03:07:56.037]  And then him and Obama are effing each other.
[03:07:56.037 --> 03:08:01.019]  And Obama is still probably radicalizing people behind the scenes as much as he can.
[03:08:01.019 --> 03:08:03.120]  I don't think, I think that that was their powder keg.
[03:08:03.120 --> 03:08:09.083]  Obviously the left has been pushing a race war in the colleges, in the media, so I just don't think they're going to get it.
[03:08:09.083 --> 03:08:11.424]  People don't, people aren't racist.
[03:08:11.424 --> 03:08:17.427]  People are sick of being, the only people that are racist that I've seen are white liberals or
[03:08:18.647 --> 03:08:24.191]  Minority liberals that have been indoctrinated hate white people or people that just want to be a victim.
[03:08:24.191 --> 03:08:30.536]  They just want to be a victim and racism is their calling card to play when they want to claim to be a victim.
[03:08:30.536 --> 03:08:32.097]  I can't stand, I got some family that are good people.
[03:08:32.975 --> 03:08:46.860]  But when they get around brown people, they just start kissing their ass and like virtue signaling and the people always just look at them and just go, it's just like, come on, you know, it just just treat people like they're people instead of weird virtue signaling.
[03:08:46.860 --> 03:08:48.761]  But I'm so sick of it.
[03:08:48.761 --> 03:08:51.282]  But you know, it's all about, you know, divide and conquer.
[03:08:51.502 --> 03:09:10.698]  I mean, you have to have the American people fighting amongst themselves, and when they realize, well, you know, maybe the racism thing isn't going to work, so let's bring in a bunch of third-world people that are never going to assimilate, and they're going to drag the economy down, and we'll shove it right in their face by giving them free... Because they literally brainwashed them for six months in camps before they bring them here.
[03:09:10.698 --> 03:09:14.381]  I mean, boot camp only lasts eight to ten weeks.
[03:09:14.381 --> 03:09:17.123]  They are brainwashing them for six months.
[03:09:17.123 --> 03:09:18.184]  How many weeks is six months?
[03:09:20.421 --> 03:09:25.984]  And that's the thing, I was listening to Jordan Klepper on, he got his new comedy set to show up, it's one against me, got cancelled.
[03:09:25.984 --> 03:09:33.388]  And he was bragging how he goes to these facilities as making a film about how they're brainwashing the illegal aliens against America.
[03:09:33.388 --> 03:09:35.549]  And he was talking about these brainwashing camps.
[03:09:35.549 --> 03:09:43.273]  They have brainwashing camps in every city, literally teaching them, America sucks, white people are bad, you deserve everything free.
[03:09:44.355 --> 03:09:46.497]  And it's madness.
[03:09:46.497 --> 03:09:49.258]  It's the left wants to bring the country down.
[03:09:49.258 --> 03:09:51.600]  Brian in California.
[03:09:51.600 --> 03:09:52.220]  You're on the air.
[03:09:52.220 --> 03:09:52.600]  Go ahead.
[03:09:52.600 --> 03:09:54.502]  We'll go to others.
[03:09:54.502 --> 03:09:57.744]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:09:57.744 --> 03:09:58.524]  Can you hear me good?
[03:09:58.524 --> 03:10:00.165]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:00.165 --> 03:10:01.386]  Okay.
[03:10:01.386 --> 03:10:09.832]  I think Trump is waiting because he was making sure that it affected enough people that everybody kind of got it.
[03:10:09.832 --> 03:10:10.392]  And, uh,
[03:10:11.522 --> 03:10:23.211]  What I think is that they're going to get more violent and I think the 3%ers need to revamp the 3% and add a zero at the end.
[03:10:23.211 --> 03:10:30.217]  Because I think 30% of Americans are sick of their water being poisoned, their air being poisoned, everything being destroyed.
[03:10:30.217 --> 03:10:33.459]  They're going after our kids, at least 30% of us.
[03:10:33.459 --> 03:10:34.840]  56 million people.
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:36.461]  You think they're going to stop 56 million people?
[03:10:38.243 --> 03:10:49.089]  No they're not, but I agree that when Trump starts trying to round up the MS-13 and criminals as he's announced, they're going to have the left stage things, get violent, trick the cops into shooting some people like Kent State.
[03:10:49.089 --> 03:10:55.973]  That's why I'm not a Machiavellian guy, I'm not a person that does false flags, but I agree with you.
[03:10:55.973 --> 03:11:03.638]  If Trump stands down and they let the illegal aliens burn a bunch of cities, it's not going to cause a capitulation.
[03:11:04.545 --> 03:11:06.927]  It's going to cause a hardening of the will after.
[03:11:06.927 --> 03:11:16.635]  And I don't want that to happen, but if we try to go in and actually arrest all these criminals, then it's going to, if you look at it psychologically, it's not going to work.
[03:11:16.635 --> 03:11:18.296]  So I'm just being honest about what's being looked at here.
[03:11:20.114 --> 03:11:23.537]  You know, President Trump probably considers all the angles, too.
[03:11:23.537 --> 03:11:24.998]  And I think we're kind of in the same page here.
[03:11:24.998 --> 03:11:27.640]  It's like, well, yeah, we have a massive invasion happening.
[03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:29.201]  That's openly UN run.
[03:11:29.201 --> 03:11:36.626]  But at the same time, you know, do we do we use that as a political tool to gain more momentum to actually shutting the border down?
[03:11:36.626 --> 03:11:38.247]  Like, you have to weigh these things.
[03:11:38.247 --> 03:11:39.949]  I mean, nobody... Well, here's how we could do it.
[03:11:39.949 --> 03:11:42.891]  If we were importing 20 million people a year, that's what they're trying to get.
[03:11:43.491 --> 03:11:44.432]  At this point.
[03:11:44.432 --> 03:11:46.853]  And we were trying, like the Earth's gonna blow up in five years.
[03:11:46.853 --> 03:11:49.094]  We're building giant launch bases in Canada.
[03:11:49.094 --> 03:11:55.318]  So we need all these extra farmers to come in and get ready so all our advanced people can get totally ready with these jump ships to get off the planet.
[03:11:55.318 --> 03:11:56.779]  It's just hypothetical.
[03:11:56.779 --> 03:11:59.901]  Then you would say, okay, give us your best people from the planet, get ready for this.
[03:12:00.655 --> 03:12:01.176]  No.
[03:12:01.176 --> 03:12:09.943]  Instead, you bring in giant third-world populations with no infrastructure, it will implode this infrastructure, meaning there's no infrastructure in the West to build up the third world.
[03:12:09.943 --> 03:12:10.864]  That's how it works.
[03:12:10.864 --> 03:12:15.689]  You destroy Gaddafi, you destroy South Africa, you destroy Africa.
[03:12:15.689 --> 03:12:17.530]  They destroyed the two industrial bases.
[03:12:17.530 --> 03:12:23.296]  And the globalists admit they want to destroy our base, not to help these people, to bring everyone down.
[03:12:23.296 --> 03:12:24.637]  That's a cold-blooded strategy.
[03:12:25.083 --> 03:12:26.805]  The open borders is worse than we think, Alex.
[03:12:26.805 --> 03:12:28.627]  I'm going to have a guess on the war room today.
[03:12:28.627 --> 03:12:30.849]  It's just a group of patriots in Arizona.
[03:12:30.849 --> 03:12:32.811]  They go down to the border just independently.
[03:12:32.811 --> 03:12:34.173]  Sometimes they camp out there at night.
[03:12:34.173 --> 03:12:35.314]  They'll just go filming.
[03:12:35.314 --> 03:12:38.477]  Every night, they catch people crossing the border illegally.
[03:12:38.477 --> 03:12:39.738]  Every night.
[03:12:39.738 --> 03:12:39.999]  That's war.
[03:12:39.999 --> 03:12:43.182]  Oh yeah, the Border Patrol says they release 2,000 a day, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:12:44.196 --> 03:12:47.819]  Everywhere you set up a camera and there are just hundreds pouring across.
[03:12:47.819 --> 03:12:50.661]  It is insane.
[03:12:50.661 --> 03:12:55.224]  Something like 17% or 16% of L.A.
[03:12:55.224 --> 03:12:57.045]  is homeless.
[03:12:57.045 --> 03:13:02.769]  There's tens of thousands on every, I mean, there's feces, rats everywhere.
[03:13:02.769 --> 03:13:04.650]  This is worse than the third world.
[03:13:04.650 --> 03:13:06.992]  This is modern weaponized takedown.
[03:13:07.759 --> 03:13:12.085]  California better watch out with what's happening in LA and San Francisco.
[03:13:12.085 --> 03:13:14.849]  I mean, InfoWars is next year's news today.
[03:13:14.849 --> 03:13:18.395]  They have typhus breaking out in California right now.
[03:13:18.395 --> 03:13:22.561]  I mean, you're like one step of a disease away from a plague.
[03:13:23.609 --> 03:13:30.634]  I mean, like, there's an outbreak happening in Fiji right now because people had to migrate to these inner cities after some cyclones.
[03:13:30.634 --> 03:13:36.518]  I mean, Alex, California, if they don't get this under control, I'm telling you, there is going to be a massive disease outbreak.
[03:13:36.518 --> 03:13:37.559]  Well, let's explain.
[03:13:37.559 --> 03:13:39.060]  California is hot.
[03:13:40.509 --> 03:13:46.210]  You bring people in from equatorial regions where diseases spread worse in hot weather.
[03:13:46.210 --> 03:13:46.470]  L.A.'
[03:13:46.450 --> 03:13:47.570]  's perfect incubation.
[03:13:47.570 --> 03:13:50.251]  They poop in the street, they pee in the street, they walk around.
[03:13:50.251 --> 03:13:53.012]  And if you do that in the frozen snow, it's not going to be as bad.
[03:13:53.012 --> 03:13:53.832]  You do that in L.A.
[03:13:53.832 --> 03:14:00.733]  with 90 degrees, baby, people are going to start dying.
[03:14:00.733 --> 03:14:03.274]  Yeah, you know, where do you go from here?
[03:14:03.274 --> 03:14:05.014]  Thank you, Brian, I appreciate your call.
[03:14:05.014 --> 03:14:10.155]  Like I said earlier, I can only take seven calls because I'll never be able to get to everybody, but let's jam in one more.
[03:14:11.903 --> 03:14:14.766]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[03:14:14.766 --> 03:14:16.768]  Who's the next caller?
[03:14:16.768 --> 03:14:18.169]  One about Satan I wanted to get to.
[03:14:18.169 --> 03:14:25.396]  I guess that caller hung up.
[03:14:25.396 --> 03:14:28.078]  Mike in Idaho, you say you moved away from Portland to get away from the zombies.
[03:14:28.078 --> 03:14:30.620]  Go ahead.
[03:14:30.620 --> 03:14:37.407]  Yeah, I'm sure you already, from just first-hand experience seeing it, you've seen a lot worse than what I had.
[03:14:38.286 --> 03:14:44.331]  From the mirror pictures they had of the guy's feet yesterday, that was just haunting of itself.
[03:14:44.331 --> 03:14:47.694]  Oh, I mean, scarier than a zombie in a movie.
[03:14:47.694 --> 03:14:51.978]  These guys were having sex and it was literally, they looked like the mummy from the movie The Mummy.
[03:14:51.978 --> 03:14:55.781]  It was like skeletons having sex.
[03:14:55.781 --> 03:15:00.965]  Yeah, and you know, it's really, really bad because I'm wondering when L.A.
[03:15:00.965 --> 03:15:02.687]  is going to wake up one morning and just find
[03:15:03.413 --> 03:15:24.558]  Tons of people dead and trash heaps everywhere because it's been to the point like you said it's just the perfect incubator for death and disease and everything and you know it's sad because it affects the whole morals of all the people around because you know I couldn't walk 10 blocks you know without seeing you know all these people just laid out on the sidewalk mostly you know a sad heroin addict but
[03:15:25.481 --> 03:15:30.643]  You know, after seeing that, it just has a profound effect on everyone around, the culture, the people, and everything.
[03:15:30.643 --> 03:15:33.544]  And, you know, after a while, it just breaks down totally.
[03:15:33.544 --> 03:15:33.964]  Stay there.
[03:15:33.964 --> 03:15:34.685]  I'm going to have you finish up.
[03:15:34.685 --> 03:15:37.025]  I'm going to go to Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com.
[03:15:37.025 --> 03:15:38.886]  Appreciate you mostly today.
[03:15:38.886 --> 03:15:39.626]  Owen Troyer here.
[03:15:39.626 --> 03:15:41.967]  Worm coming up in 45 minutes.
[03:15:41.967 --> 03:15:42.908]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[03:15:42.908 --> 03:15:51.011]  Imagine emaciated skeletons with skin flaking off with a gravy of flies and sweat having sex in the open.
[03:15:53.328 --> 03:15:54.529]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:54.529 --> 03:15:58.450]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:58.450 --> 03:15:59.991]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:59.991 --> 03:16:02.953]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:02.953 --> 03:16:08.515]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:08.515 --> 03:16:09.716]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:09.716 --> 03:16:12.657]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:12.657 --> 03:16:14.878]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:16:22.862 --> 03:16:29.224]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:29.224 --> 03:16:32.265]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:32.265 --> 03:16:38.187]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:38.187 --> 03:16:41.968]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:41.968 --> 03:16:43.228]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:43.228 --> 03:16:44.569]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:44.569 --> 03:16:50.770]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:50.770 --> 03:16:52.211]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:52.904 --> 03:16:55.107]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.

[03:19:57.652 --> 03:20:00.259]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.213 --> 03:20:16.755]  The West is under globalist attack.
[03:20:16.755 --> 03:20:19.437]  Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com is about to take over.
[03:20:19.437 --> 03:20:20.818]  Finishing up with Mike in Idaho.
[03:20:20.818 --> 03:20:23.660]  Mike, I've told this story of Skid Row.
[03:20:23.660 --> 03:20:26.363]  We got some footage of it, and you saw similar things.
[03:20:26.363 --> 03:20:32.708]  We're showing footage of people who only take heroin and don't eat.
[03:20:32.708 --> 03:20:40.555]  And so they're emaciated like a concentration camp victim, but they're on heroin and other drugs, and they're having sex covered in flies.
[03:20:41.693 --> 03:20:45.255]  And then they come after you, telling you they want to have sex with you.
[03:20:45.255 --> 03:20:46.796]  Now, you've seen zombie movies.
[03:20:46.796 --> 03:20:48.658]  The zombies are scary when they're attacking.
[03:20:48.658 --> 03:20:51.960]  Imagine real zombies that want to have sex with you.
[03:20:51.960 --> 03:20:55.742]  And I'm telling you, I've never seen evil of this magnitude.
[03:20:55.742 --> 03:21:00.165]  I'm talking about a fly gravy that was going on.
[03:21:00.165 --> 03:21:02.187]  The stench, unbelievable.
[03:21:03.249 --> 03:21:12.195]  And again, that's just one snapshot of the hell that's going on that the left's created, and they've tried to cover it up so long, now it's all coming out.
[03:21:12.195 --> 03:21:17.298]  What do you expect to happen next in the attempt to collapse the United States?
[03:21:17.298 --> 03:21:23.943]  Well, I tell people you're probably not going to have to wait a hundred years for the conditions of lithium-like stuff, you know.
[03:21:23.943 --> 03:21:31.848]  We're going to see those conditions even worse, and that's why I just ran from these blue states, because they're just a catcher's mitt now for just
[03:21:32.782 --> 03:21:44.186]  Basically just human decay and suffering and obviously these people who, you know, build giant, you know, Facebook, Google and all those, you know, the Silicon Valley holders down there, they don't give a damn.
[03:21:44.645 --> 03:21:50.827]  They drive right past those people and go right to their big, you know, their big... No, no, but I agree, but it's bigger than that, and I appreciate your call.
[03:21:50.827 --> 03:21:51.767]  They're orchestrating it.
[03:21:51.767 --> 03:21:52.727]  Mike Adams is taking over.
[03:21:52.727 --> 03:21:54.828]  Mike, thanks for hosting part of this hour today.
[03:21:54.828 --> 03:21:57.008]  Sorry I jumped in here, but I know you're cool with that.
[03:21:57.008 --> 03:21:57.549]  What do you make?
[03:21:57.549 --> 03:22:01.330]  I know you've got your own topics, your own issues to cover, but we cannot exaggerate.
[03:22:01.330 --> 03:22:08.692]  San Francisco now has bars where you eat with rats that defecate at your table with you, and you celebrate the rats, you celebrate the collapse.
[03:22:08.692 --> 03:22:10.792]  If this isn't demonic, then I don't know what is.
[03:22:10.792 --> 03:22:13.773]  I mean, if the devil didn't exist, the left has invented the devil.
[03:22:14.775 --> 03:22:25.577]  Well, in my view, Alex, and thanks for having me on today, what it looks like to me is cultural terraforming to turn human society into something that these demons are familiar with.
[03:22:25.577 --> 03:22:28.998]  They want to turn our world into their hell.
[03:22:28.998 --> 03:22:36.879]  So you look at all the images that you just described, the zombies, the flies, the putrid stench, the suffering and pain, murdering babies.
[03:22:36.879 --> 03:22:38.700]  What do all these things have in common?
[03:22:38.700 --> 03:22:40.880]  These are scenes from hell.
[03:22:41.900 --> 03:22:46.322]  These are depicted in, you know, paintings throughout the millennia.
[03:22:46.322 --> 03:22:47.782]  Scenes from hell.
[03:22:47.782 --> 03:22:54.405]  And the left has become literally infested with demons or demonic influence, demonic energy.
[03:22:54.405 --> 03:22:55.405]  They worship Satan.
[03:22:55.405 --> 03:22:56.385]  They worship death.
[03:22:56.385 --> 03:22:57.626]  They want to murder babies.
[03:22:57.626 --> 03:23:03.508]  And they are literally trying to recreate hell on earth, while the rest of us are trying.
[03:23:03.508 --> 03:23:05.709]  And I want to be clear and interrupt you, because I've been around a bunch of them now.
[03:23:06.249 --> 03:23:07.190]  They're not acting.
[03:23:07.190 --> 03:23:07.931]  It's not a joke.
[03:23:07.931 --> 03:23:09.593]  They're not trying to shock you.
[03:23:09.593 --> 03:23:10.815]  They'll say the same things.
[03:23:10.815 --> 03:23:11.656]  They'll say weird things.
[03:23:11.656 --> 03:23:13.959]  They'll say things that they shouldn't know.
[03:23:13.959 --> 03:23:17.222]  And it's like, just like Linda Blair, it's like, how's that grandma doing?
[03:23:17.222 --> 03:23:19.605]  And, you know, it's like really sick.
[03:23:19.605 --> 03:23:20.847]  And they're like, we're getting your kids.
[03:23:20.847 --> 03:23:21.307]  Don't worry.
[03:23:21.307 --> 03:23:22.369]  Ha ha ha.
[03:23:22.369 --> 03:23:22.809]  Sorry, Mike.
[03:23:22.809 --> 03:23:23.150]  Take over.
[03:23:24.404 --> 03:23:32.568]  Well, the key to recognize is that many of these people, those that are the most extreme that you see depicted in videos, they are not even human anymore.
[03:23:32.568 --> 03:23:33.669]  They don't qualify as human.
[03:23:33.669 --> 03:23:36.490]  They are zombified, you might say.
[03:23:36.490 --> 03:23:39.291]  Completely turned over to this transmission.
[03:23:39.291 --> 03:23:41.733]  Yes, yes, they are.
[03:23:41.733 --> 03:23:48.756]  It's almost like they have been taken over by demonic spirits and the human side of them is no longer home.
[03:23:49.443 --> 03:24:00.045]  They may have a human body, even though that's usually decaying and breaking down and, you know, engaging in all kinds of crazy acts that they're driven to by the demonic influence inside.
[03:24:00.045 --> 03:24:02.006]  But, you know, this is no joke.
[03:24:02.006 --> 03:24:04.226]  I'm not speaking in metaphors, and I know you know that.
[03:24:04.226 --> 03:24:07.227]  But to your audience, we're not talking about metaphors.
[03:24:07.227 --> 03:24:11.787]  We're talking about literal demonic infestation.
[03:24:11.787 --> 03:24:14.208]  We're talking about a demon invasion.
[03:24:15.003 --> 03:24:28.613]  Through non-material planes or portals that come in and take over human bodies and then essentially nullify or kick out the human spirit and take it over with a satanic or demonic spirit.
[03:24:28.613 --> 03:24:29.854]  That's exactly what's happening.
[03:24:30.518 --> 03:24:34.181]  And again, they've proven with science the sixth sense of the genetic broadcast.
[03:24:34.181 --> 03:24:37.343]  We think about like wireless internet or an overwrite.
[03:24:37.343 --> 03:24:46.611]  These people have been overwritten by a new program, and they tell you they have a new program, and it's to destroy humans and kill everyone, and then just like Linda Blair, they laugh at you and say they're going to get you.
[03:24:46.611 --> 03:24:57.719]  Yeah, I want to go back to the last caller and the analogy he made to the movie Elysium, which is where the Earth is decaying, so the elite launch up onto a ship in space where they can all live productive lives, healthy lives.
[03:24:59.702 --> 03:25:03.444]  America is the Elysium of Earth.
[03:25:03.444 --> 03:25:04.324]  Okay?
[03:25:04.324 --> 03:25:08.666]  And the left tries to lie about it and say, oh, it's only for white people of European descent.
[03:25:08.666 --> 03:25:10.007]  No, it's for everyone.
[03:25:10.007 --> 03:25:14.349]  But you have to, you know, pass the standards to get onto Elysium.
[03:25:14.349 --> 03:25:15.770]  You need to be disease-free.
[03:25:15.770 --> 03:25:17.931]  You need to want to be a productive member of our society.
[03:25:17.931 --> 03:25:19.892]  You need to like the way we live our lives here.
[03:25:19.892 --> 03:25:22.233]  You need to embrace Western culture.
[03:25:22.233 --> 03:25:24.194]  And what they're doing now is they're bringing in everybody
[03:25:25.094 --> 03:25:26.956]  To destroy Elysium.
[03:25:26.956 --> 03:25:27.856]  Because they hate it.
[03:25:27.856 --> 03:25:29.838]  Because they hate America.
[03:25:29.838 --> 03:25:32.520]  Because they're building the real breakaway civilization.
[03:25:32.520 --> 03:25:35.723]  They don't want a breakaway civilization that's distributed to everybody, as an example.
[03:25:35.723 --> 03:25:36.144]  Exactly.
[03:25:36.144 --> 03:25:44.170]  Against dehumanized globalism, post-humanism, post-human systems, post-human era, post-industrial era.
[03:25:44.170 --> 03:25:46.552]  So they have the real breakaway civilization.
[03:25:46.552 --> 03:25:51.557]  They're in competition because the Renaissance is the original breakaway civilization, but one that delivers.
[03:25:52.077 --> 03:25:54.899]  And one that still exists for humans in the West.
[03:25:54.899 --> 03:25:56.540]  It's called the United States of America.
[03:25:56.540 --> 03:26:04.587]  So yeah, you destroy the Elysium on Earth, and then all the benefits of people that came to Elysium came to America.
[03:26:04.587 --> 03:26:07.389]  Again, it is for everybody, but we have a vetting process.
[03:26:07.389 --> 03:26:08.410]  Of course we do.
[03:26:08.410 --> 03:26:10.691]  Just like they would on a ship in space.
[03:26:10.691 --> 03:26:11.292]  It makes sense.
[03:26:11.292 --> 03:26:14.494]  Just like any other country would that doesn't want to see itself collapse.
[03:26:14.494 --> 03:26:15.435]  But what do we see?
[03:26:15.435 --> 03:26:15.775]  Great points.
[03:26:15.775 --> 03:26:16.796]  You're live in 30 minutes.
[03:26:16.796 --> 03:26:18.197]  Mike, thanks for letting me take some of your time.
[03:26:18.197 --> 03:26:19.278]  NaturalNews.com.
[03:26:19.278 --> 03:26:20.619]  Tell us what else you've got coming up today.
[03:26:21.820 --> 03:26:27.566]  We're going to cover today's big announcement by Google and YouTube to essentially engage in thought cleansing.
[03:26:27.566 --> 03:26:34.853]  They're going to be eliminating thousands of video channels and anything that contradicts the official narrative of history on any event.
[03:26:34.853 --> 03:26:36.155]  That's been announced today.
[03:26:36.155 --> 03:26:40.559]  It's a massive, again, a mental cleansing of the Internet.
[03:26:40.559 --> 03:26:43.162]  We're going to be talking about neuroplasticity.
[03:26:43.462 --> 03:26:51.587]  And how the globalists have managed to exploit human neurology to weaponize your own mind against you, and why this is so important to understand.
[03:26:51.587 --> 03:26:55.589]  It's a survival mechanism in humans, but it can also be weaponized and turned against us.
[03:26:55.589 --> 03:26:57.190]  That's what has happened.
[03:26:57.190 --> 03:27:05.595]  Talk about the land invasion, the tactics now being used by Mexico to spread out the invaders across the border to make sure that we can't defend against it.
[03:27:05.595 --> 03:27:12.039]  And then also finally, Alex, why the masses will not survive the culling that is coming.
[03:27:12.339 --> 03:27:13.921]  The masses will not survive.
[03:27:13.921 --> 03:27:14.662]  I'm convinced.
[03:27:14.662 --> 03:27:19.867]  We can't save more than about maybe 5% of the people because of what's coming.
[03:27:19.867 --> 03:27:24.873]  There's no doubt the globalists are making good on their plan to bring down industrial nations, bring down the West.
[03:27:24.873 --> 03:27:25.894]  You do that.
[03:27:25.894 --> 03:27:28.116]  The West was the hope to help the third world.
[03:27:28.116 --> 03:27:29.558]  You bring the West down, it's done.
[03:27:31.161 --> 03:27:32.522]  Well, right, exactly.
[03:27:32.522 --> 03:27:36.503]  And it's, they have, again, they've weaponized humans against themselves.
[03:27:36.503 --> 03:27:47.688]  So they have turned humans into the weapons that will destroy other humans, and then they've broken down the neurology and the spirit enough to allow this demon infestation that we've been talking about.
[03:27:47.688 --> 03:27:50.010]  This is biblical stuff that's happening right now.
[03:27:50.010 --> 03:27:55.132]  We've talked about this before, but we're watching revelation unfold.
[03:27:55.592 --> 03:27:56.673]  Before our very eyes.
[03:27:56.673 --> 03:28:01.696]  By the way, everyone knows this is true at a gut spiritual level, but the globalists even admit it.
[03:28:01.696 --> 03:28:08.460]  They believe they've made a deal with this entity that if they do this to us, they'll somehow be the few that get, you know, rewarded with this new silicon body.
[03:28:08.460 --> 03:28:09.521]  This is biblical.
[03:28:09.521 --> 03:28:10.201]  This is happening.
[03:28:10.201 --> 03:28:11.782]  We're on a planet in space.
[03:28:11.782 --> 03:28:18.126]  This is literally a program being projected on us to kill each other and destroy the planet.
[03:28:18.126 --> 03:28:19.006]  It's unbelievable, Mike.
[03:28:19.006 --> 03:28:19.707]  It's really happening.
[03:28:20.478 --> 03:28:20.798]  That's right.
[03:28:20.798 --> 03:28:33.911]  And don't forget, the globalists think that they will be saved by declaring AI machines to be their savior while they reject God and reject all that is nature, including biology and male and female.
[03:28:33.911 --> 03:28:35.293]  They are rejecting everything that's real.
[03:28:35.293 --> 03:28:35.733]  Remember Elon Musk?
[03:28:35.733 --> 03:28:36.394]  Remember Elon Musk?
[03:28:36.394 --> 03:28:37.795]  I was not going to interrupt, but you're absolutely right.
[03:28:38.556 --> 03:28:40.760]  He came out and said, I go to these meetings with top globalists.
[03:28:40.760 --> 03:28:43.124]  They want to kill everybody and worship AI gods.
[03:28:43.124 --> 03:28:43.926]  Beware them.
[03:28:43.926 --> 03:28:44.907]  They try to destroy him.
[03:28:44.907 --> 03:28:46.410]  He's backed off and shut up now.
[03:28:46.410 --> 03:28:47.332]  So they quit.
[03:28:47.332 --> 03:28:48.394]  That's what they teach.
[03:28:48.394 --> 03:28:49.957]  Mike Adams straight ahead.
[03:28:49.957 --> 03:28:51.639]  War Room, 30 minutes away with Owen Troyer.
[03:28:53.178 --> 03:28:54.679]  Oh, these pains.
[03:28:54.679 --> 03:28:57.220]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[03:28:57.220 --> 03:28:59.040]  I've got to get some relief.
[03:28:59.040 --> 03:29:04.723]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[03:29:04.723 --> 03:29:06.623]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[03:29:06.623 --> 03:29:08.404]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?
[03:29:08.564 --> 03:29:09.045]  Yes.

[03:31:53.703 --> 03:32:02.990]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:05.853]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:05.853 --> 03:32:11.918]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.578 --> 03:32:18.822]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.822 --> 03:32:25.127]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.127 --> 03:32:32.071]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:33.192 --> 03:32:34.812]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:10.273 --> 03:33:16.959]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:16.959 --> 03:33:19.261]  It's Mike Adams.
[03:33:19.261 --> 03:33:22.103]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.665 --> 03:33:30.912]  All right, breaking news today that has been, well, it's been covered by quite a few of the independent media outlets.
[03:33:30.912 --> 03:33:44.086]  The Broward County Sheriff's deputy named Scott Peterson, who stood down as the Parkland school shooting, remember the Marjorie Douglas Stoneman High School shooting took place, I think
[03:33:44.873 --> 03:33:46.894]  Taking the lives of 17 students.
[03:33:46.894 --> 03:33:50.176]  During that shooting, Scott Peterson stood down.
[03:33:50.176 --> 03:33:53.879]  Not only did he refuse to enter the building, even though he was trained to do so.
[03:33:53.879 --> 03:33:55.360]  He's supposed to be the responding officer.
[03:33:55.360 --> 03:33:56.500]  He was there.
[03:33:56.500 --> 03:34:02.904]  He stood down and he also directed other members of law enforcement to stand down and do not enter the building.
[03:34:02.904 --> 03:34:06.046]  And he has now been indicted on 11 counts of child neglect
[03:34:09.631 --> 03:34:29.570]  This indictment has been handed down from an investigative department inside the state of Florida, and this has been reported widely, including by local media outlet WCTV, and this follows an investigation carried out by the state of Florida, by the way, which never would have happened, I think, unless Ron DeSantis
[03:34:30.393 --> 03:34:30.793]  I don't think so.
[03:34:45.330 --> 03:34:54.438]  Right, so he heard children being shot, and he refused to... He didn't have any curiosity, like, huh, I wonder, are children being shot in this school?
[03:34:54.438 --> 03:34:58.702]  He's there, with a firearm, with training, to respond.
[03:34:58.702 --> 03:35:01.324]  He's had active shooter training, didn't do anything.
[03:35:01.324 --> 03:35:03.366]  Also, according to the report, he, quote, retreated.
[03:35:03.966 --> 03:35:07.890]  During the act of shooting, while victims were being shot.
[03:35:07.890 --> 03:35:20.100]  So instead of running toward the gunshots, like a law enforcement officer would normally do to try to save lives and try to take out the threat, he ran away from the gunshots.
[03:35:20.100 --> 03:35:27.747]  And he also, quote, directed other law enforcement personnel to stay away from the building and not interfere with the shooting.
[03:35:29.341 --> 03:35:37.546]  Now, that's being widely reported, but here's my analysis that isn't reported, and take this for what you will.
[03:35:37.546 --> 03:35:54.816]  In my analysis, and with the experience of journalism and history of all kinds of, you know, events taking place, including false flag elements that have happened in the past, or stand-down elements that have happened in the past, my analysis is, this was a real event.
[03:35:54.816 --> 03:35:57.017]  Of course, children were shot.
[03:35:57.017 --> 03:35:57.857]  They were killed.
[03:35:57.857 --> 03:35:58.878]  They were sacrificed.
[03:35:59.446 --> 03:36:12.894]  But Scott Peterson and others, I believe, were ordered to stand down in order to maximize the fatalities of innocent children so that the gun control lobby could control the narrative.
[03:36:12.894 --> 03:36:18.217]  So that they could cause mass carnage in order to demand gun confiscation and new gun laws.
[03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:24.093]  Now, I've got this article right now up at Natural News.
[03:36:24.093 --> 03:36:26.715]  InfoWars, you're welcome to post it as well if you haven't already.
[03:36:26.715 --> 03:36:28.356]  Or maybe you've got your own coverage of it.
[03:36:28.356 --> 03:36:30.438]  But this is spreading like wildfire.
[03:36:30.438 --> 03:36:36.822]  This report and this acknowledgement that this person chose to stand down.
[03:36:36.822 --> 03:36:39.984]  So no one can say to us, oh, you're making that up.
[03:36:39.984 --> 03:36:40.805]  This didn't happen.
[03:36:40.805 --> 03:36:41.225]  No.
[03:36:41.225 --> 03:36:43.987]  This is a Florida state investigation.
[03:36:43.987 --> 03:36:47.129]  And the man has been indicted on 11 counts.
[03:36:47.129 --> 03:36:49.351]  And he's facing decades in prison.
[03:36:50.009 --> 03:36:51.470]  Why did he stand down?
[03:36:51.470 --> 03:37:01.674]  I believe he was ordered to do so, and I would hope that this investigation would go up the chain of command to, I think his name is Scott Israel, right?
[03:37:01.674 --> 03:37:03.114]  Sheriff Israel there.
[03:37:03.114 --> 03:37:05.876]  And probably others who may have been involved.
[03:37:05.876 --> 03:37:10.638]  It needs to be investigated because this looks like a stand down order.
[03:37:10.638 --> 03:37:18.921]  Now, in order to understand the context of this, you also have to go back and look at Eric Holder, the former Attorney General under Barack Obama.
[03:37:19.827 --> 03:37:23.410]  And how they try to pull off Operation Fast and Furious.
[03:37:23.410 --> 03:37:44.109]  During Operation Fast and Furious, in case you don't remember, they deliberately allowed firearms to walk out of gun stores and into the hands of Mexican drug cartels, knowing that those firearms would come back across the border into the United States and be used to carry out acts of gang violence against innocent Americans.
[03:37:45.057 --> 03:37:50.261]  And there was at least one border official who was murdered by one of those weapons that we know of.
[03:37:50.261 --> 03:37:52.143]  There are probably many more.
[03:37:52.143 --> 03:38:03.071]  This operation was plotted and carried out by Barack Obama, Eric Holder, and many others in order to stage real violence to call for gun control.
[03:38:03.071 --> 03:38:07.935]  This is something that Democrats do again and again and again.
[03:38:07.935 --> 03:38:11.518]  And the fact that Democrats are willing to murder their own children
[03:38:12.088 --> 03:38:14.909]  Tells us that they don't care how many kids they kill.
[03:38:14.909 --> 03:38:20.131]  To them, killing kids is just what they say post-birth abortion.
[03:38:20.131 --> 03:38:39.376]  If they can kill a bunch of kids and gain control over the narrative, and then Google can come along and ban all dissenting views that question the official narrative, then the Democrats can control that conversation about gun control, or about the Second Amendment, or individual liberties and human rights, and all these things.
[03:38:39.376 --> 03:38:41.057]  And that's exactly what they have done here.
[03:38:41.841 --> 03:38:44.702]  I believe these children were sacrificed.
[03:38:44.702 --> 03:38:47.783]  I believe they were allowed to be killed.
[03:38:47.783 --> 03:39:00.248]  And I believe that the parents of those children, if they really want to do something about what happened to their innocent children, they should file suit against Broward County Sheriff's Department.
[03:39:00.248 --> 03:39:03.309]  They should look into what Scott Peterson did.
[03:39:03.309 --> 03:39:04.490]  They should follow this report.
[03:39:05.256 --> 03:39:14.999]  You know, stop blaming those of us who question the official narrative when we now know the official plan was to stand down.
[03:39:14.999 --> 03:39:24.062]  It's patriots like us and it's Second Amendment supporters like us and concealed carriers like us who would have entered that building to stop the shooter.
[03:39:24.062 --> 03:39:26.943]  We would have tried to save the lives of children.
[03:39:26.943 --> 03:39:29.004]  We, the conservatives and the Trump supporters,
[03:39:29.691 --> 03:39:35.414]  We are not the kind of people who would run away from innocent children being killed.
[03:39:35.414 --> 03:39:38.576]  We would not tell law enforcement, no, don't enter the building.
[03:39:38.576 --> 03:39:42.878]  But that's what Scott Peterson did according to this report.
[03:39:42.878 --> 03:39:49.741]  And that's what Democrats do again and again and again to maximize the violence, maximize the bloodshed.
[03:39:49.741 --> 03:39:52.383]  Because again, Democrats are demons at this point.
[03:39:52.383 --> 03:39:53.443]  They're demon-crats.
[03:39:53.443 --> 03:39:55.544]  That's the proper word for them.
[03:39:55.544 --> 03:39:58.406]  These people don't care how many kids they kill.
[03:39:59.201 --> 03:40:02.323]  Because they murder their own kids.
[03:40:02.323 --> 03:40:06.585]  Once you realize that, that they have legalized infanticide and they actually stood up and cheered.
[03:40:06.585 --> 03:40:12.207]  Remember the standing ovation in the legislative chambers of New York, the state of New York.
[03:40:12.207 --> 03:40:18.310]  They stood up and cheered when they passed the bill to murder their own babies.
[03:40:18.310 --> 03:40:19.831]  And they call that women's health.
[03:40:20.598 --> 03:40:30.525]  And then the New York Times comes out and says, well, a baby, an unborn child doesn't have a heartbeat, they say, it has, what do they call it, embryonic pulsing.
[03:40:30.525 --> 03:40:34.028]  So now they have to use language to twist everything around.
[03:40:34.028 --> 03:40:40.932]  They say, oh, it's not murdering a baby, it's not infanticide, it's just, it's women's health care, you see.
[03:40:40.932 --> 03:40:43.094]  Oh, it's not a heartbeat, it's embryonic pulsing.
[03:40:44.664 --> 03:40:57.853]  Well, by their logic, I mean, I guess they could justify any kind of murder of children, which is probably what they tell themselves when they are ordering each other to stand down and not rescue these children in mass shootings.
[03:40:57.853 --> 03:41:06.899]  And I believe, there's no question in my mind, that the scene of that shooting had to be chosen in advance because this stand down had to be coordinated.
[03:41:06.899 --> 03:41:09.961]  Obviously, these officers had to be told to stand down.
[03:41:09.961 --> 03:41:12.863]  And I challenge you to go look now throughout the history
[03:41:13.639 --> 03:41:14.840]  Of events.
[03:41:14.840 --> 03:41:15.920]  Of mass shootings.
[03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:18.641]  Maybe look at what happened in Las Vegas.
[03:41:18.641 --> 03:41:20.702]  Look at what happened even in Oklahoma City.
[03:41:20.702 --> 03:41:22.723]  Look at what happened in Waco.
[03:41:22.723 --> 03:41:23.744]  Look at 9-11.
[03:41:23.744 --> 03:41:27.745]  Look at all these events and just start asking intelligent questions.
[03:41:27.745 --> 03:41:30.186]  Was someone ordered to stand down?
[03:41:30.186 --> 03:41:35.969]  Why didn't the United States Air Force intercept those jumbo jets on September 11, 2001?
[03:41:35.969 --> 03:41:37.149]  What happened there?
[03:41:37.149 --> 03:41:38.790]  What happened to our national defenses?
[03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:40.491]  Why was there a stand down order?
[03:41:41.235 --> 03:41:45.258]  Why are there in many events training exercises?
[03:41:45.258 --> 03:41:54.165]  Training exercises that suddenly go live or sometimes training exercises that take resources away that would normally respond to an active shooter situation.
[03:41:54.165 --> 03:42:01.831]  There are a lot of questions to be asked and it's especially notable today that Google has announced you can no longer ask questions.
[03:42:01.831 --> 03:42:07.695]  You must accept the official narrative on everything according to Google and YouTube.
[03:42:07.695 --> 03:42:09.737]  You can't question anything.
[03:42:09.737 --> 03:42:10.718]  You can't question
[03:42:11.627 --> 03:42:13.568]  What CNN says to be true.
[03:42:13.568 --> 03:42:21.170]  You're not even allowed to question the Russia collusion narrative that's been pushed by the desperate Democrats for the last two and a half years now.
[03:42:21.170 --> 03:42:22.911]  No questions allowed!
[03:42:22.911 --> 03:42:28.873]  This is the new tech tyranny, techno-fascism that has taken over our country.
[03:42:28.873 --> 03:42:33.735]  And yet right here, what you're watching right now, Infowars.com, we ask the questions.
[03:42:33.735 --> 03:42:36.196]  We dare to exercise our human
[03:42:37.199 --> 03:42:38.880]  Ingenuity and curiosity.
[03:42:38.880 --> 03:42:41.642]  We ask questions and bring you real answers.
[03:42:41.642 --> 03:42:43.984]  I'll have more answers for you right on the other side of this break.
[03:42:43.984 --> 03:42:44.785]  Stay with me.
[03:42:44.785 --> 03:42:45.485]  Mike Adams here.
[03:42:45.485 --> 03:42:54.011]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:54.011 --> 03:43:00.536]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:43:01.397 --> 03:43:05.660]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[03:43:05.660 --> 03:43:09.383]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:43:15.049 --> 03:43:16.750]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:43:16.750 --> 03:43:17.971]  This is racketeering.
[03:43:17.971 --> 03:43:19.091]  This is cartels.
[03:43:19.091 --> 03:43:21.492]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:43:21.492 --> 03:43:23.373]  We need it now.
[03:43:23.373 --> 03:43:25.074]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:43:25.074 --> 03:43:34.019]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:43:34.019 --> 03:43:42.063]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:43:42.063 --> 03:43:42.924]  The way to fight back
[03:43:43.564 --> 03:43:48.393]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:43:48.393 --> 03:43:52.159]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:43:54.969 --> 03:43:56.829]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[03:43:56.829 --> 03:43:57.710]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[03:43:57.710 --> 03:43:59.070]  You are the man, Alex.
[03:43:59.070 --> 03:44:00.590]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[03:44:00.590 --> 03:44:01.390]  I'm so excited.
[03:44:01.390 --> 03:44:02.291]  I'm such a big fan.
[03:44:02.291 --> 03:44:04.771]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[03:44:04.771 --> 03:44:07.272]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[03:44:07.272 --> 03:44:08.692]  The Bone Broth.
[03:44:08.692 --> 03:44:10.292]  The Bone Broth.
[03:44:10.292 --> 03:44:11.733]  The Bone Broth.
[03:44:11.733 --> 03:44:12.773]  The Bone Broth.
[03:44:12.773 --> 03:44:15.994]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake.
[03:44:15.994 --> 03:44:17.534]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[03:44:17.534 --> 03:44:18.694]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[03:44:18.694 --> 03:44:20.374]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[03:44:20.374 --> 03:44:21.935]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[03:44:21.935 --> 03:44:22.655]  Like, good!
[03:44:23.015 --> 03:44:23.616]  Whoa!
[03:44:23.616 --> 03:44:25.337]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[03:44:25.337 --> 03:44:29.521]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride 3 toothpaste.
[03:44:29.521 --> 03:44:33.324]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[03:44:33.324 --> 03:44:35.346]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[03:44:35.346 --> 03:44:37.908]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products to get me some air.
[03:44:37.908 --> 03:44:38.668]  I'm thanking you.
[03:44:38.668 --> 03:44:45.114]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[03:44:45.114 --> 03:44:45.935]  It is next level.
[03:44:45.935 --> 03:44:46.515]  It really is good.
[03:44:46.515 --> 03:44:47.056]  So thank you.
[03:44:47.056 --> 03:44:48.997]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[03:44:48.997 --> 03:44:49.358]  Thank you.
[03:44:54.250 --> 03:44:58.852]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[03:44:58.852 --> 03:45:00.872]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:45:00.872 --> 03:45:01.953]  Good to talk to you.
[03:45:01.953 --> 03:45:06.595]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[03:45:06.595 --> 03:45:08.535]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[03:45:08.535 --> 03:45:13.097]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[03:45:13.397 --> 03:45:19.364]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[03:45:19.364 --> 03:45:20.125]  I appreciate that.
[03:45:20.125 --> 03:45:21.747]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:45:21.747 --> 03:45:22.348]  Tell us about it.
[03:45:22.348 --> 03:45:23.129]  Well, it's really great.
[03:45:23.129 --> 03:45:24.411]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:45:24.411 --> 03:45:24.931]  I take it.
[03:45:24.931 --> 03:45:25.672]  It tastes good.
[03:45:25.672 --> 03:45:27.514]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:45:27.514 --> 03:45:29.477]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:45:29.477 --> 03:45:32.921]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:45:32.961 --> 03:45:35.782]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:45:35.782 --> 03:45:37.562]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:45:37.562 --> 03:45:39.642]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:45:39.642 --> 03:45:40.563]  So, yeah.
[03:45:40.563 --> 03:45:43.003]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:45:43.003 --> 03:45:45.824]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[03:45:45.824 --> 03:45:46.964]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:45:46.964 --> 03:45:48.844]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:48.844 --> 03:45:49.724]  Okay, it's true.
[03:45:49.724 --> 03:45:51.085]  I stayed up late last night.
[03:46:52.148 --> 03:46:57.092]  And get the fish oil.
[03:46:57.092 --> 03:47:07.941]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:07.941 --> 03:47:10.343]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:10.343 --> 03:47:14.227]  It's Alex Jones with Mike Adams.
[03:47:16.533 --> 03:47:18.234]  Alright, this is the last segment for today.
[03:47:18.234 --> 03:47:19.934]  Thank you for continuing with me.
[03:47:19.934 --> 03:47:24.156]  Mike Adams here on InfoWars with Alex Jones.
[03:47:24.156 --> 03:47:30.059]  In this segment, I'm going to really introduce you to a concept that you might find life-changing.
[03:47:30.059 --> 03:47:32.099]  It's about neuroplasticity.
[03:47:32.099 --> 03:47:44.384]  And what it means is that, well, the survival mechanism for humankind, for as long as we have been successful on this planet, is due to this phenomenon called neuroplasticity.
[03:47:44.384 --> 03:47:45.345]  And what it means is that
[03:47:45.965 --> 03:47:53.516]  Your brain can be rewired either consciously by yourself or through training or through influences.
[03:47:53.516 --> 03:47:59.624]  You can be rewired to, of course, learn new skills or even to accept new realities.
[03:48:00.362 --> 03:48:03.243]  Now, this is a survival mechanism and you're born with it.
[03:48:03.243 --> 03:48:06.125]  It's part of the divine gift of who you are.
[03:48:06.125 --> 03:48:07.745]  Every child is born with it.
[03:48:07.745 --> 03:48:12.628]  In fact, of course, a child is developing their brain and their heart and their body before they're born.
[03:48:12.628 --> 03:48:17.610]  You know, they're human before they're born, even though liberals say that unborn babies aren't human somehow.
[03:48:17.610 --> 03:48:19.611]  I'm not sure what they think they are.
[03:48:19.611 --> 03:48:22.412]  But, of course, all of this is happening during development.
[03:48:22.412 --> 03:48:23.833]  You're born with this incredible gift.
[03:48:24.398 --> 03:48:25.559]  Neuroplasticity.
[03:48:25.559 --> 03:48:31.803]  That's what allows humans to survive in any climate, in any challenge.
[03:48:31.803 --> 03:48:40.728]  It's what enables us to learn new skills, to even have abstract concepts, such as developing software and engaging in commerce and transaction systems, things like that.
[03:48:40.728 --> 03:48:42.189]  But there's a downside to this.
[03:48:43.010 --> 03:48:49.854]  Because you have neuroplasticity, your neurology can also be programmed against your best interests.
[03:48:49.854 --> 03:48:52.315]  And this is exactly what the globalists are doing.
[03:48:52.315 --> 03:49:08.163]  What they have perfected over the last several decades is research into neurology and ways to exploit or hijack your neurology and turn it against you to get you to do things that will destroy humanity.
[03:49:08.163 --> 03:49:10.244]  And let me give you one of the most obvious examples here.
[03:49:10.976 --> 03:49:31.200]  If, let's say, a generation ago, let's say 25 years ago, if you had said to somebody that, I'll bet you that in 25 years that we could get a bunch of people to stand up and applaud murdering their own children, you would say, no, that couldn't happen.
[03:49:32.040 --> 03:49:34.222]  And yet, the globalists have accomplished that.
[03:49:34.222 --> 03:49:39.046]  That is the law in New York, the infanticide law, and it's happening elsewhere.
[03:49:39.046 --> 03:49:41.348]  And liberals are standing up and cheering that.
[03:49:41.348 --> 03:49:42.449]  They're demanding it.
[03:49:42.449 --> 03:49:53.419]  So, a question is, how can you get a population, I mean, this is an evil thing to do, this is what globalists are doing, how could they get a population to destroy themselves?
[03:49:53.419 --> 03:49:56.822]  And the answer is through exploiting their neurology.
[03:49:57.822 --> 03:50:02.807]  And it's not just murdering their own children, it's also normalizing pedophilia, for example.
[03:50:02.807 --> 03:50:16.521]  So one of the things that's happening in society today, through Netflix and their pedophilia programming, and other Hollywood producers and channels and networks and so on, even Good Morning America, normalizing pedophilia.
[03:50:17.190 --> 03:50:29.152]  This is all about rewiring your neurology to now accept this idea that pedophilia, what they're trying to make you do is accept it as okay, when of course it's not okay.
[03:50:29.152 --> 03:50:36.034]  And they're trying to get you to accept this idea that chemically castrating young children is somehow acceptable as well.
[03:50:36.034 --> 03:50:46.316]  That physically maiming a young boy, cutting off their genitalia to turn them into a young transgender girl, somehow this is being pushed as normal.
[03:50:47.333 --> 03:50:55.296]  And again, what they're doing is they're rewiring your neurology to make these images and make these ideas seem acceptable.
[03:50:55.296 --> 03:51:02.579]  In fact, you're supposed to love these ideas because it's all being pushed in the name of tolerance and acceptance and love.
[03:51:03.351 --> 03:51:07.012]  I think it was just the other day, Instagram put out a new filter.
[03:51:07.012 --> 03:51:09.953]  I think it was Instagram, maybe it was Snapchat.
[03:51:09.953 --> 03:51:10.693]  One or the other.
[03:51:10.693 --> 03:51:19.176]  It put out a filter that said, love, I think it was called, love knows no age, or love has no age limit, something like that.
[03:51:19.176 --> 03:51:20.656]  And it was a pedophilia filter!
[03:51:21.354 --> 03:51:34.688]  And the idea of the filter was to push the idea that, in their view, they think it's okay for older people to pursue sexual relationships with young children, which is a twisted idea, of course.
[03:51:34.688 --> 03:51:36.910]  But it's that normalization.
[03:51:36.910 --> 03:51:38.652]  And you've seen this happening.
[03:51:38.652 --> 03:51:43.878]  And the conclusion to this, and what's so important, why I'm covering this, is because
[03:51:44.793 --> 03:51:55.436]  If you want to beat the globalists, and if you want to defend yourself, your family, your nation, your culture, you must protect your neurology.
[03:51:55.436 --> 03:51:56.236]  This is key.
[03:51:56.236 --> 03:51:59.617]  It's not just about protecting your physical borders, even though that's important.
[03:51:59.617 --> 03:52:04.278]  It's not just about protecting your body from a physical attack, even though that's important as well.
[03:52:04.278 --> 03:52:05.999]  It's about protecting your neurology.
[03:52:08.191 --> 03:52:18.503]  There's something that linguists know, that your brain automatically processes words and sentences that you're exposed to, even if you do not voluntarily wish to process those things.
[03:52:19.065 --> 03:52:22.688]  You have an automatic circuit, you might say, inside your brain.
[03:52:22.688 --> 03:52:24.730]  It's a neuro-linguistic circuit.
[03:52:24.730 --> 03:52:37.440]  It processes words and sentences and images and abstract concepts automatically, and then after those are processed, those are allowed to ripple up into your conscious mind, and sometimes they get pushed into your subconscious mind.
[03:52:37.440 --> 03:52:46.427]  So just being around CNN or being around MSNBC, allowing those broadcasts to enter your consciousness, just to enter your senses,
[03:52:47.020 --> 03:52:56.063]  Just to see those images and hear those twisted ideas is reshaping your neurology and reprogramming your mind.
[03:52:56.063 --> 03:53:01.185]  It's almost juvenile to call it brainwashing because it's not classical brainwashing.
[03:53:01.185 --> 03:53:02.146]  It's not hypnosis.
[03:53:02.146 --> 03:53:06.948]  Oh, you know, watch the ticking clock and, you know, you're going to change what you believe.
[03:53:06.948 --> 03:53:10.409]  No, it's a lot more powerful and subtle at the same time.
[03:53:11.087 --> 03:53:19.654]  It's rewiring your brain from the inside to where you think that your new beliefs are your own rather than from outside influences.
[03:53:19.654 --> 03:53:23.657]  And this is what Edward Bernays, of course, helped really pioneer.
[03:53:23.657 --> 03:53:25.979]  And the Rockefeller's research helped pioneer.
[03:53:25.979 --> 03:53:31.643]  And this is what modern marketing and advertising by the big tech giants and the big corporations is all about.
[03:53:32.603 --> 03:53:37.371]  This is what virtue signaling is all about by these corporations like Nike and so on.
[03:53:37.371 --> 03:53:44.482]  It's all about not telling you to go buy their products, but rather rewiring your brain so that you
[03:53:46.192 --> 03:54:05.089]  Inexplicably feel that these corporations are somehow good companies, even though they're pushing ideas that include pedophilia, the sexualization of children, the physical maiming of the genitalia of children, all kinds of, you know, Sodom and Gomorrah class stuff that they're pushing.
[03:54:05.089 --> 03:54:06.590]  This is how they do it.
[03:54:06.590 --> 03:54:08.592]  So you need to control your exposure.
[03:54:10.743 --> 03:54:18.285]  And make sure that you are only feeding your mind and your eyes and your ears good, wholesome sources of information.
[03:54:18.285 --> 03:54:22.046]  You must limit watching Netflix shows.
[03:54:22.046 --> 03:54:25.046]  You must limit watching twisted Hollywood movies.
[03:54:25.046 --> 03:54:31.368]  You need to carefully select the types of shows and even entertainment that you engage in.
[03:54:31.368 --> 03:54:33.748]  That's the only way to get through this.
[03:54:33.748 --> 03:54:35.349]  Because I've got news for you.
[03:54:35.349 --> 03:54:37.289]  Most of humanity will not survive what's coming.
[03:54:38.277 --> 03:54:42.459]  Because most of humanity has now been turned into a weapon against itself.
[03:54:42.459 --> 03:54:44.680]  There is a suicide mission.
[03:54:44.680 --> 03:54:48.442]  And what I call the left cult is a suicide cult.
[03:54:48.442 --> 03:54:58.168]  And they have been infused with all of these impulses and destructive ideas and anti-nature ideas and anti-God ideas.
[03:54:58.168 --> 03:55:02.050]  They exist as contradictions to the laws of the universe.
[03:55:02.050 --> 03:55:03.851]  They exist as contradictions to life.
[03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:06.371]  And human dignity.
[03:55:06.371 --> 03:55:08.673]  And this is why they are always pushing violence.
[03:55:08.673 --> 03:55:11.255]  This is why they seem deranged and insane.
[03:55:11.255 --> 03:55:14.097]  This is why they call for violence against their political enemies.
[03:55:14.097 --> 03:55:19.401]  This is why they support authoritarianism and online censorship and deplatforming.
[03:55:19.401 --> 03:55:25.025]  They are twisted, demonic, destructive individuals who have been hijacked.
[03:55:25.025 --> 03:55:32.090]  Their brains have been essentially lobotomized through what you really might call neuro-linguistic programming, NLP.
[03:55:32.090 --> 03:55:33.411]  You know, you've probably heard that term before.
[03:55:33.411 --> 03:55:34.172]  If not, go look it up.
[03:55:35.086 --> 03:55:36.747]  NLP.
[03:55:36.747 --> 03:55:40.910]  Barack Obama only spoke in NLP techniques.
[03:55:40.910 --> 03:55:46.013]  He was a mind control master during his entire presidency.
[03:55:46.013 --> 03:55:54.579]  Every speech was carefully crafted to rewire your brain and turn you against yourself and turn humanity against itself.
[03:55:54.579 --> 03:55:55.159]  I hope that's not
[03:55:56.027 --> 03:55:57.568]  Too complex.
[03:55:57.568 --> 03:55:59.349]  Too much of a download of information.
[03:55:59.349 --> 03:56:03.011]  There's a lot more that we need to talk about in coming episodes.
[03:56:03.011 --> 03:56:08.475]  I'll be hosting the fourth hour again next Wednesday here on InfoWars.com.
[03:56:08.475 --> 03:56:10.796]  Also be sure to check out Brighteon.com.
[03:56:10.796 --> 03:56:13.798]  That's the YouTube alternative video website.
[03:56:13.798 --> 03:56:15.359]  All the InfoWars videos are there.
[03:56:15.359 --> 03:56:17.921]  O. S. Troyer, David Knight videos are there.
[03:56:17.921 --> 03:56:20.723]  My videos are there and thousands of other channels as well.
[03:56:20.723 --> 03:56:24.285]  As Google and YouTube are cracking down on truth and honesty,
[03:56:24.921 --> 03:56:30.886]  You're going to have to find alternative sources, otherwise you won't have control over your own neurology.
[03:56:30.886 --> 03:56:33.008]  And you're going to have to shut off Netflix.
[03:56:33.008 --> 03:56:35.970]  You're going to have to shut off the twisted Hollywood movies.
[03:56:35.970 --> 03:56:49.621]  You're going to have to stop watching the pedophilia and the violence and the teen sex scenes that are pushed on Netflix and their twisted shows that show like demonic, satanic sex orgies among teenagers.
[03:56:49.621 --> 03:56:52.524]  That's the new norm, but you don't have to accept it.
[03:56:52.524 --> 03:56:53.465]  I hope that makes sense.
[03:56:54.045 --> 03:56:55.966]  So we'll have a lot more for you.
[03:56:55.966 --> 03:57:00.328]  I've got a lot of survival and prepping and gear reviews coming up in the weeks ahead.
[03:57:00.328 --> 03:57:03.150]  More analysis of events that are happening.
[03:57:03.150 --> 03:57:10.593]  Remember that if you can survive the next five to six years, you will be in the top probably five percent of humanity.
[03:57:10.593 --> 03:57:18.457]  Because I think that something so big is coming down that most of the human race will not survive much longer.
[03:57:18.457 --> 03:57:20.058]  And that's by design by the globalists.
[03:57:20.586 --> 03:57:29.613]  They do not want the masses to continue to exist, and they're making sure that there's only a small subset of survivors among the human race.
[03:57:29.613 --> 03:57:31.795]  We'll help you be among the survivors.
[03:57:31.795 --> 03:57:33.617]  Keep watching InfoWars.
[03:57:33.617 --> 03:57:35.438]  Keep reading all of our independent news websites.
[03:57:35.438 --> 03:57:36.359]  Thank you for watching.
[03:57:36.359 --> 03:57:37.480]  Mike Adams here.
[03:57:37.480 --> 03:57:37.980]  Be safe.
[03:57:37.980 --> 03:57:38.621]  Until next week.
[03:57:38.621 --> 03:57:38.881]  Take care.
[03:57:43.869 --> 03:57:48.893]  InfoWard, the most banned network in the world.
[03:57:48.893 --> 03:57:53.336]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[03:57:53.336 --> 03:57:54.277]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[03:57:54.277 --> 03:57:54.737]  Yes, sir.
[03:57:54.737 --> 03:57:56.038]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:57:56.038 --> 03:57:58.120]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[03:57:58.120 --> 03:58:04.064]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[03:58:04.064 --> 03:58:06.006]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[03:58:06.006 --> 03:58:06.966]  God bless you, brother.
[03:58:06.966 --> 03:58:13.251]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread
[03:58:13.971 --> 03:58:15.071]  You're our only hope, brother.
[03:58:15.071 --> 03:58:17.392]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[03:58:17.392 --> 03:58:20.132]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[03:58:46.358 --> 03:58:55.769]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
