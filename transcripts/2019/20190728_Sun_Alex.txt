[00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:15.378]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.139]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.820]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:21.062]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:22.423]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:27.666]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:42.059]  Ladies and gentlemen, Trump is moving and moving in a big way against the deep state.
[00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:50.729]  On Friday in a press conference he said there should be criminal investigation of Obama and Hillary for their deep state activities trying to overthrow his election.
[00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.412]  That's called attempted overthrow of the government.
[00:00:53.913 --> 00:00:54.794]  It's called high treason.
[00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:58.238]  Then, Congressman John Ratcliffe
[00:00:59.568 --> 00:01:07.815]  Did the rounds in the last two days on Fox News, you name it, saying there's going to be criminal charges coming for a lot of high-level people.
[00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:08.736]  That's a big deal.
[00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:18.745]  But how big was it then when Trump, 15 minutes ago, tweeted this out?
[00:01:20.174 --> 00:01:26.299]  I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to the Director of National Intelligence.
[00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:27.600]  A former U.S.
[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.643]  Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loves.
[00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:34.085]  Dan Coats, the current Director, will be stepping down.
[00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:41.411]  Now the word is, Coats helped with the whole ongoing cover-up that lied to Trump's face.
[00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:50.194]  With General Rogers, former head of the NSA that first warned Trump when he was president-elect, this is beyond bombshell information.
[00:01:50.575 --> 00:01:52.776]  And I was already up here three hours ago.
[00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:55.018]  I don't normally get up here three hours for the show.
[00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:55.959]  I get ready at home.
[00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.603]  I was up here three hours ago with a whole stack on the fact that Trump is pushing for criminal indictments.
[00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:04.084]  Does it mean it's going to happen?
[00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:04.925]  Probably.
[00:02:05.882 --> 00:02:08.124]  But it means that things are going to heat up big time.
[00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:10.466]  Everybody better be frosty and have their fingers crossed.
[00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:16.070]  They're getting down on their knees to little baby Jesus because this is a very serious time to be alive.
[00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.131]  I don't have to tell you that.
[00:02:18.031 --> 00:02:20.954]  And we've got clips of what the President's been saying about this and more.
[00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:28.639]  He hinted at it, more than hinted, he said there should be basically criminal investigation into Obama and Hillary in a press conference Friday.
[00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:29.240]  Here's part of that.
[00:02:30.503 --> 00:02:35.068]  We want to find out what happened with the last Democrat president.
[00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.472]  Let's look into Obama the way they've looked at me from day one.
[00:02:38.532 --> 00:02:41.035]  They've looked into everything that we've done.
[00:02:42.377 --> 00:02:45.360]  They could look into the book deal that President Obama made.
[00:02:45.781 --> 00:02:47.523]  Let's subpoena all of his records.
[00:02:47.623 --> 00:02:49.165]  Let's subpoena all of the records.
[00:02:49.765 --> 00:02:50.166]  We're good.
[00:03:03.902 --> 00:03:07.947]  The majority in the House, they didn't do subpoenas all day long.
[00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:10.209]  They didn't do what these people have done.
[00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:11.531]  What they're doing is a disgrace.
[00:03:11.571 --> 00:03:13.072]  So destructive to our country.
[00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:15.515]  And I think that's why we're going to take back the House.
[00:03:16.296 --> 00:03:21.902]  That's why we're easily going to hold the presidency and we're going to continue to hold the Senate.
[00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:26.102]  And, you know, people don't say, but we picked up two seats in the Senate.
[00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:29.784]  We went from 51 to 53 in the 18th election.
[00:03:29.864 --> 00:03:30.704]  Nobody says it.
[00:03:31.184 --> 00:03:32.225]  They talk about the House.
[00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:34.986]  And I didn't get to campaign very much for the House.
[00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:37.207]  I couldn't because we were campaigning for the Senate.
[00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:39.648]  We almost picked up five seats.
[00:03:40.028 --> 00:03:41.008]  You know that very well.
[00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.909]  So it's a disgrace that they're doing it.
[00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:45.570]  They're doing it for political reasons.
[00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.731]  And most of them, many of them, are admitting that.
[00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:49.672]  It's politics.
[00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.215]  And frankly, it's a very sad thing for our country.
[00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:53.555]  Yes.
[00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:56.598]  Trump has been surrounded.
[00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:58.700]  Trump has been demonized.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.460]  He's been lied about.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.201]  He's been obstructed.
[00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:04.305]  But he's really getting his heels in now.
[00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:08.749]  He's really... His tires are not spinning anymore.
[00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.771]  They're catching onto the ground here.
[00:04:11.071 --> 00:04:12.052]  He's getting real friction.
[00:04:12.692 --> 00:04:15.055]  And moving forward, the problem is
[00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:26.657]  The Internet and Facebook and Twitter and YouTube are conservatively, when it comes to politics, hundreds of times bigger than all cable news combined.
[00:04:29.359 --> 00:04:38.045]  I mean, routinely, before they banned us, shadow banned us three years ago, then totally banned us last year, we had videos with 50 million, 40 million views every week.
[00:04:38.985 --> 00:04:40.386]  Average video, a million views.
[00:04:40.486 --> 00:04:41.267]  It's insane.
[00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:42.608]  And everybody else had that.
[00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:43.588]  It's all gone.
[00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.629]  More than 200,000
[00:04:49.161 --> 00:04:50.803]  Well, it's worse than that.
[00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:51.403]  Did I say 200,000?
[00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:58.351]  More than 200 million people on Facebook and Instagram got banned today that follow Trump.
[00:04:58.831 --> 00:04:59.993]  He'll never even know about it.
[00:05:00.273 --> 00:05:00.874]  It's all coming up.
[00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:12.445]  Before I started working at InfoWars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com, but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:19.555]  And there's one product that's offered at InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:23.399]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests.
[00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:27.223]  Telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:36.012]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[00:05:36.032 --> 00:05:38.154]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but
[00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:39.374]  It's expensive.
[00:05:39.454 --> 00:05:39.695]  Why?
[00:05:39.775 --> 00:05:42.255]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:49.498]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went.
[00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:52.519]  But DNA Force Plus is still there.
[00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:54.119]  It is the elite supplement.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.181]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[00:05:58.221 --> 00:06:04.083]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:19.239]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:21.483 --> 00:06:24.665]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, history is happening right now.
[00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:31.769]  There have been a series of events that have taken place in the last three days that are beyond historic.
[00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.330]  They are bombshell bombshells.
[00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:40.354]  John Ratcliffe, the congressman from Texas, has been nominated to head up all 17 U.S.
[00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:41.835]  intelligence agencies.
[00:06:42.355 --> 00:06:43.356]  Coats sued Trump
[00:06:44.116 --> 00:06:50.379]  Trump has learned that working against the restoration of the republic, a lot of evidence shows, is being removed.
[00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:57.063]  And why that is so important is, he'll be able to now get into all the files and data on how Trump was illegally spied on.
[00:06:57.083 --> 00:06:58.323]  We've already reverse engineered it.
[00:06:58.724 --> 00:07:00.044]  It's already come out in federal court.
[00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:06.388]  But now, all of the crimes of Obama and Hillary illegally spying on candidate Trump
[00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:11.183]  Spying on him when he was president-elect, then president, then lying to Congress.
[00:07:11.804 --> 00:07:13.547]  It's all coming out.
[00:07:13.668 --> 00:07:14.810]  This is huge.
[00:07:15.491 --> 00:07:17.855]  And the system is completely freaking out.
[00:07:19.179 --> 00:07:31.386]  They are running around like chickens with their heads cut off, chirping and squeaking and squawking, that Trump's a Nazi, all the rest of this, trying to create race riots or something.
[00:07:31.446 --> 00:07:32.267]  None of it's working.
[00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:37.390]  Numbers show that record numbers of black Americans and Hispanic Americans are supporting Trump.
[00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.951]  A lot of incredible things are happening.
[00:07:39.731 --> 00:07:41.952]  I'm going to run through this, this segment, the good news.
[00:07:43.013 --> 00:07:43.954]  The bad news is
[00:07:45.066 --> 00:08:09.859]  Trump has real blind spots, and I was told those by people that know the president well three years ago, and I've seen it in his speeches, and the speech he gave a few weeks ago at the censorship summit on social media at the White House, and I've seen further statements from him, and you know, I get Mr. President, you're 73 and everything, and you don't know how the internet really works, but I'm gonna explain something.
[00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:23.736]  In the last three days, more accounts have been lost on Facebook and Twitter of your bonafide supporters than you have on both of your Twitters, your Instagram, and everything else.
[00:08:25.696 --> 00:08:30.278]  200 million followers on major accounts.
[00:08:30.398 --> 00:08:32.738]  Two of the accounts had 70 million together.
[00:08:33.558 --> 00:08:34.198]  74 million together.
[00:08:34.599 --> 00:08:36.199]  One had 40-something million, one 30 million.
[00:08:38.206 --> 00:08:44.048]  The sites were getting hundreds of millions of views of your damn videos!
[00:08:44.828 --> 00:08:51.171]  You don't think they put you unfiltered on CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, where they only have a million viewers, maybe?
[00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:54.832]  These little meme channels were bigger than Fox News!
[00:08:56.012 --> 00:09:06.196]  But all the little fancy outfits and all the suits and all the consultants and that incestuous douchebag that is the Republican establishment
[00:09:07.227 --> 00:09:08.108]  Excuse my French here.
[00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:11.531]  They don't want to compete with the internet.
[00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:13.173]  We don't even want the campaign money.
[00:09:15.253 --> 00:09:17.134]  We don't even... I never got a dime of it.
[00:09:17.174 --> 00:09:19.595]  We just don't want to live in a communist country.
[00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:24.076]  And I was bigger than Fox News three years ago when they shadow banned me.
[00:09:24.777 --> 00:09:29.419]  Matt Drudge is still bigger than Fox News because he has his own site that everybody has to go to, which is good.
[00:09:29.619 --> 00:09:39.963]  He came here three years ago to warn me to emergency get everybody off those sites before I got banned because he talked to a Supreme Court justice that told him it was coming and they've almost passed a bill.
[00:09:41.403 --> 00:09:43.064]  In the House of Representatives right now,
[00:09:45.049 --> 00:09:48.352]  Bipartisan to give people $30,000 fines for memes.
[00:09:49.353 --> 00:09:49.933]  I'm not joking.
[00:09:51.374 --> 00:09:52.175]  Go straight to jail.
[00:09:54.917 --> 00:10:01.163]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's where this country has gone.
[00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:03.685]  $15,000 to $30,000 fines.
[00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:06.467]  That's the same thing they passed in Europe last year.
[00:10:06.827 --> 00:10:10.130]  My listeners thought I was making it up and didn't think it was real.
[00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:13.233]  It's the law in Europe.
[00:10:16.172 --> 00:10:17.373]  So, let's stop right there.
[00:10:18.334 --> 00:10:26.560]  I know for Trump, watching Fox News and reading the New York Times and having people show him clips of my show and things like that is how he gets the news.
[00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:31.003]  And specifically, if I scream at the President, somehow that gets to him.
[00:10:32.164 --> 00:10:40.731]  But the point is, is that almost everyone else under the age of about 40 communicates over Instagram more than Facebook.
[00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:49.363]  And the heads of Instagram resigned last year when they said Zuckerberg's gonna censor everybody and going to kill the platform.
[00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:53.885]  So, I'm gonna explain this again.
[00:10:56.407 --> 00:10:58.788]  Over 200 million followers, I added it up.
[00:10:58.868 --> 00:11:03.111]  When it got reported on Friday at RT, it was over 120 million.
[00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:05.452]  Two of the accounts alone, 74 million.
[00:11:06.353 --> 00:11:07.233]  That's bigger than your Twitter.
[00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:09.575]  Bigger than your Instagram combined, Mr. President.
[00:11:13.609 --> 00:11:16.951]  There's two of them are bigger than everybody you're able to reach and guess what little secret was?
[00:11:17.472 --> 00:11:23.836]  Almost everybody was getting what they got on Instagram because Instagram wanted to be big before Facebook bought it a few years ago.
[00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:29.560]  And now Facebook is running it into the ground because Facebook buys up everything to kill competition.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:31.602]  It's a giant stinking cartel.
[00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:37.106]  So in the second hour, I'm going to stop getting into this now and get into the good news.
[00:11:39.352 --> 00:11:45.356]  In the second hour, I'm going to lay all the numbers out, I'm going to lay all the facts out, and I'm going to go over every bit of it.
[00:11:47.357 --> 00:11:59.785]  But I see Trump at his White House event going, well you know it was rigged in 2016, a lot of dead people voting, a lot of illegals, and a lot of censorship, but I still beat it, I'll just campaign harder.
[00:12:01.809 --> 00:12:09.136]  It's your followers there at those campaign events with 50,000 people all streaming it everywhere and putting out videos to get 100 million views, Trump.
[00:12:09.396 --> 00:12:11.778]  You've already got the 50,000 people at your rally.
[00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:16.863]  You want to use them as a giant media army to jack into everything which you had.
[00:12:18.264 --> 00:12:19.666]  Hillary was arrogant back then.
[00:12:19.686 --> 00:12:20.626]  They're not arrogant now.
[00:12:21.227 --> 00:12:27.493]  The censorship, Mr. President, we're seeing right now is, I don't know, 50,000 times worse than we saw before.
[00:12:28.729 --> 00:12:30.569]  Total shadow banning, down to nothing.
[00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.830]  We have a Twitter or Facebook account, but no one can see it.
[00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:40.432]  Or they go past that, with total bans of my name and InfoWars, and now they're saying the word Christian.
[00:12:40.472 --> 00:12:41.973]  YouTube's officially sent letters out.
[00:12:41.993 --> 00:12:50.735]  We have the letters and videos saying, you can have Muslim outreach, but churches can no longer advertise, because Christian, what's the word they use?
[00:12:52.155 --> 00:12:58.277]  Christian does not follow the terms of service, unacceptable content, keyword Christian.
[00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:01.547]  We have the official video!
[00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.348]  Oh, how liberal!
[00:13:04.228 --> 00:13:06.209]  Well, they're a private company, they can do what they want.
[00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:15.173]  Oh yeah, that has 90% of the search controls in the world, and that is openly saying they're top executive over, quote, all new projects.
[00:13:15.533 --> 00:13:18.175]  That means she certifies that everything's politically correct and evil.
[00:13:18.915 --> 00:13:21.256]  She certifies that instead of don't be evil, that it is evil.
[00:13:22.807 --> 00:13:27.449]  And she says on the Veritas video, we're gonna make sure he never gets re-elected.
[00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:37.713]  They're sitting there, literally pissing in your face, crapping on us, and we're taking this illegal, un-American cartel crap that China blushes at.
[00:13:40.194 --> 00:13:41.675]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:42.796 --> 00:13:44.196]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:45.297 --> 00:13:46.577]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:48.238 --> 00:13:50.479]  So, Trump is either an idiot,
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.261]  And he's so arrogant, he believes he's Superman, he's doing this all by himself.
[00:13:57.801 --> 00:14:01.142]  Hey, Trump, locked up in a jail cell, how are you going to convince people what you're doing is right?
[00:14:01.462 --> 00:14:05.803]  I love you, Trump, but it'd be like watching my father slit his own throat.
[00:14:05.903 --> 00:14:06.624]  I'm going to stop him.
[00:14:07.484 --> 00:14:10.125]  Or watching somebody you love snorting cocaine or something.
[00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:12.325]  Listen to me, I watch all your speeches.
[00:14:12.925 --> 00:14:15.026]  You're like, well, they are censoring, we're going to have to work harder.
[00:14:15.306 --> 00:14:15.846]  Work harder!
[00:14:17.506 --> 00:14:19.228]  They've sued me over 30 times.
[00:14:19.248 --> 00:14:20.789]  They've tried to kill my ass, basically.
[00:14:20.909 --> 00:14:22.230]  They're trying to take me off the air!
[00:14:24.312 --> 00:14:26.154]  They're taking all your allies off air!
[00:14:27.114 --> 00:14:28.476]  They're trying to get Tucker off the air!
[00:14:28.676 --> 00:14:31.018]  How much more of this crap you gonna take from these damn bullies?
[00:14:31.618 --> 00:14:34.040]  Who say you're building concentration camps and you're a Nazi?
[00:14:36.763 --> 00:14:37.944]  So, I'm done talking about this.
[00:14:39.005 --> 00:14:41.307]  Next hour, though, I'm tearing into POTUS.
[00:14:42.517 --> 00:14:45.419]  Because let me tell you, if he goes down, I'm going to have to leave the country.
[00:14:45.439 --> 00:14:47.361]  Because they are coming after me, they're coming after you.
[00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:49.062]  I mean, these globalists are crooks.
[00:14:49.863 --> 00:14:58.730]  And I've been watching Trump closely, and I've been talking to his advisors, and finally some of my people have gotten meetings with his head campaign guy in Florida.
[00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.392]  And they're finally getting it some, but not quick enough.
[00:15:01.932 --> 00:15:03.353]  We need dramatic action.
[00:15:04.014 --> 00:15:08.678]  You've had top computer scientists in front of Congress tell you, Google's bragging they're going to steal the election.
[00:15:08.818 --> 00:15:10.119]  They can hit one button and do it!
[00:15:15.359 --> 00:15:23.602]  So when we come back, that tweet from November 28th of last year, now that no Russia collusion is a proven lie, when do the trials for treason begin?
[00:15:24.082 --> 00:15:24.803]  I'll tell you this too.
[00:15:26.263 --> 00:15:27.584]  We're on hundreds of radio stations.
[00:15:27.604 --> 00:15:29.184]  Please tell everybody about those great affiliates.
[00:15:29.284 --> 00:15:31.165]  And we're on hundreds of TV stations and cable systems.
[00:15:31.225 --> 00:15:34.707]  Please, however you're watching, tell folks, hey, the Forbidden Show is on right now.
[00:15:34.747 --> 00:15:35.127]  Here it is.
[00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:38.308]  And share us via your email and via your text message.
[00:15:38.328 --> 00:15:40.509]  They still can't fully censor that, though
[00:15:41.687 --> 00:15:46.629]  Facebook owns WhatsApp and it's censoring people promoting Trump there and InfoWars as well.
[00:15:46.689 --> 00:15:48.050]  So, they're watching everything you do.
[00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:48.550]  Big Brothers.
[00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:57.794]  Oh, by the way, London Guardian reported that all the different devices you bring into your house, supposedly, are your personal assistants.
[00:15:58.215 --> 00:16:01.136]  They're all watching and listening to you have sex and reporting it back.
[00:16:03.248 --> 00:16:06.310]  Ladies and gentlemen, you saw it just a few weeks ago.
[00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.191]  The greatest show on earth.
[00:16:10.312 --> 00:16:15.114]  20 clown Democrats all offering more free stuff than the next person.
[00:16:15.554 --> 00:16:22.658]  Bernie Tanders said we all get $15 minimum wage unless you work for me.
[00:16:23.698 --> 00:16:24.559]  At his campaign.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.624]  But since then, we've seen, oh, little Eric swallows well.
[00:16:28.764 --> 00:16:30.326]  Ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling-ling.
[00:16:30.767 --> 00:16:31.768]  Sucking on his thumb.
[00:16:32.329 --> 00:16:32.769]  He was at 0%.
[00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.534]  But, Beto O'Rourke's polling at 0%.
[00:16:37.014 --> 00:16:38.917]  He hasn't stepped down either.
[00:16:39.077 --> 00:16:42.921]  So, coming up this Tuesday, and this Wednesday,
[00:16:43.582 --> 00:16:50.425]  We're going to have, from Detroit, Michigan, Clown World 2, the greatest show on Earth!
[00:16:51.065 --> 00:16:53.886]  Ringmaster, bring me my microphone!
[00:16:55.627 --> 00:17:00.589]  They want to normalize their leftist propaganda that America's run by Nazis.
[00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:02.389]  We didn't kill the Nazis and defeat them.
[00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:11.333]  That America's torturing little Hispanic children in concentration camps, even though they're the most open nation in the world, and 60-plus percent of the Border Patrol's Hispanic.
[00:17:12.386 --> 00:17:14.487]  They want to sell you on the idea.
[00:17:14.507 --> 00:17:27.375]  Cory Booker, Joe Biden, and all the rest of these individuals want to tell you how much America sucks.
[00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:39.622]  And so it's going to be a great train wreck watching them fall all over themselves, demonizing America and promising free education, free health care, free homes, even if you don't want to work.
[00:17:40.543 --> 00:17:41.603]  You're going to get free stuff.
[00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:44.725]  They've all adopted AOC's policies.
[00:17:45.385 --> 00:17:49.466]  Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas is trying to crash the U.S.
[00:17:49.686 --> 00:17:52.007]  economy right now, trying to stop Trump.
[00:17:52.127 --> 00:18:02.131]  We're going to be covering it this Tuesday and this Wednesday live with myself, Robert Barnes, David Knight, Owen Schroer, Will Johnson's in town, and so many others.
[00:18:02.151 --> 00:18:07.293]  And we're going to have reporters on the ground, Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett and others, just like last time.
[00:18:07.693 --> 00:18:09.774]  They're covering the entire spectacle.
[00:18:10.154 --> 00:18:12.355]  This is going to be the greatest show on earth.
[00:18:12.735 --> 00:18:38.567]  We're going to document just how pathetic these maggots are and we're going to have people on the street covering it all at clownworld.us and infowars.com forward slash show and on hundreds of radio and TV stations in defiance of the globalist censors that don't want us to point out the emperor's new clothes, that don't want us to point out how pathetic they are and how the whole world is sick of these people.
[00:18:38.967 --> 00:18:39.127]  So,
[00:18:39.747 --> 00:18:42.789]  Do your part, my friends, if you want to defeat the censors, and I know you do.
[00:18:43.169 --> 00:18:52.634]  Spread the world about our two-night only coverage of Clown World 2, the greatest show on earth, at InfoWars.com forward slash show and ClownWorld.us.
[00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:56.756]  I'm Alex Jones, and I endorse this message.
[00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:09.122]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom, and they're trying to take away our flag.
[00:19:15.402 --> 00:19:17.282]  But we can't let them get away with it.
[00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:26.485]  That's why you need to go to Infowarestore.com right now and get yourself a limited edition Betsy Ross flag t-shirt, which is on sale for $17.76.
[00:19:27.505 --> 00:19:31.966]  You can also get the same Don't Tread on Me t-shirt that Chris Pratt was wearing.
[00:19:32.426 --> 00:19:41.468]  By purchasing these t-shirts, you're not only supporting your country and your president, but you're supporting me and helping make sure I can keep making these videos you love.
[00:19:42.048 --> 00:19:50.190]  They're only printing a limited supply of these t-shirts, so make sure you get yours right now at InfoWarsStore.com before they sell out.
[00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:53.411]  God bless America, and God bless InfoWars.
[00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:57.751]  Flawless victory.
[00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:08.974]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:30.703 --> 00:20:34.585]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:20:36.186 --> 00:20:40.909]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:47.635 --> 00:20:55.522]  Coming up next segment, every major Democrat out there, from AOC to Joe Biden, has said, let's get physical, let's have a physical war.
[00:20:56.263 --> 00:21:02.528]  Coming up next segment, MSNBC tells Democrats we are at war with unindicted criminal Trump.
[00:21:03.649 --> 00:21:12.497]  Just a few days before that, that was Friday, a few days before that, MSNBC said, crush, destroy their supporters.
[00:21:12.637 --> 00:21:13.818]  Go out and find them!
[00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:17.899]  Wow, what a group of criminals.
[00:21:18.979 --> 00:21:22.601]  There's so much more to get to, but remember Barack Obama?
[00:21:23.962 --> 00:21:34.186]  He got $65 million for a book that didn't even sell, a couple million dollars, and there's no discussion of that payoff.
[00:21:36.127 --> 00:21:38.108]  And the President wants it looked into.
[00:21:39.909 --> 00:21:41.370]  But what about all the illegal spying?
[00:21:42.796 --> 00:21:43.336]  On the President.
[00:21:43.716 --> 00:21:44.497]  What about all that?
[00:21:45.117 --> 00:21:46.658]  What about the lying to Congress?
[00:21:47.078 --> 00:21:48.659]  What about the sellout to China?
[00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:50.659]  The sellout to Russia with Uranium One?
[00:21:50.699 --> 00:21:52.140]  What about Hillary Serber?
[00:21:53.061 --> 00:22:06.106]  What about Obama working with Communists and Islamists in Kenya to overthrow his country, where he's from, where his dad's from?
[00:22:07.267 --> 00:22:12.089]  I mean, there's so many crimes, funding ISIS, funding Al Qaeda, that'll make your head spin.
[00:22:14.209 --> 00:22:23.912]  And they sit there and, like, go through all of Trump's hundreds of lawyers and hundreds of properties and find somebody who didn't pay for their taxis for a decade that owed $5 million, and then that's Trump's fault?
[00:22:24.112 --> 00:22:24.892]  No connection to it?
[00:22:26.893 --> 00:22:28.614]  And they still can't find any dirt on Trump.
[00:22:29.674 --> 00:22:36.636]  But Trump has this corrupt Justice Department that won't go after the Clintons and the Obamas because they all know where the bodies are buried.
[00:22:37.016 --> 00:22:40.897]  Well, Trump's finally getting people in that are going to take action.
[00:22:41.578 --> 00:22:42.658]  And John Ratcliffe
[00:22:44.178 --> 00:22:51.144]  Says Attorney General William Barr will deliver justice to any Obama officials who committed crimes, and they go on to say they have all the evidence.
[00:22:51.544 --> 00:22:52.905]  They have all the documents.
[00:22:54.046 --> 00:22:56.368]  They have all of the admissions.
[00:22:56.488 --> 00:22:57.489]  And oh, guess what?
[00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.071]  That came out a day ago.
[00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:05.796]  Now today, that was on July 27th of Saturday, he said that.
[00:23:05.856 --> 00:23:08.439]  Now on July 28th, Trump says about an hour ago,
[00:23:09.719 --> 00:23:20.108]  I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of the National Intelligence Agencies for all 17 agencies and below.
[00:23:20.128 --> 00:23:22.810]  A former U.S.
[00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.434]  Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the country he loves.
[00:23:30.016 --> 00:23:31.958]  Dan Coats is thrown out on his butt.
[00:23:34.158 --> 00:23:38.620]  President said Dan Coats, the current director, will be leaving office on July 15th.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.681]  I would like to thank Dan for his great service to our country.
[00:23:41.981 --> 00:23:44.022]  The acting director will be named shortly.
[00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:55.527]  So Trump's got a prosecutor from the Justice Department, who also knows Congress, about to go in there and run
[00:23:57.265 --> 00:24:07.992]  Operation out of all 17 agencies getting a white glove inspection and then all that being passed on to the Justice Department to dig out the traitors.
[00:24:08.982 --> 00:24:12.003]  Inside the Justice Department that are working with the Globalists, the Chi-Coms, and others.
[00:24:12.463 --> 00:24:16.104]  The EU, the big central banks, all the robber barons.
[00:24:16.464 --> 00:24:18.084]  There'll probably be a few Rooskies in there, too.
[00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:19.844]  I've just studied the whole thing.
[00:24:19.964 --> 00:24:21.545]  There are some Rooskie spies.
[00:24:21.565 --> 00:24:22.405]  We've got spies over there.
[00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:23.425]  But they do exist!
[00:24:23.765 --> 00:24:25.906]  Most of them buy off Democrats.
[00:24:25.926 --> 00:24:29.586]  Because everybody knows blue cities, blue states are sellouts.
[00:24:31.407 --> 00:24:32.927]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:33.787 --> 00:24:36.528]  Trump is about to do a major proctology exam.
[00:24:38.095 --> 00:24:40.877]  Army's individuals and they are going to be fighting back.
[00:24:41.337 --> 00:24:44.839]  I said that on Friday when I called into my own show with Owen Schroeder doing a great job co-hosting.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.401]  And I say it again today and this is what President Trump said on Friday.
[00:24:49.462 --> 00:25:01.550]  But before we go to that, I want to play what the new nominated head of all of the oversight group that oversees all 17 agencies, the Director of National Intelligence,
[00:25:02.537 --> 00:25:13.964]  That has all the oversight power by Congress invested in him, a congressman, now to be the head of that, and a former prosecutor, that's got to scare the hell out of the establishment.
[00:25:14.225 --> 00:25:16.986]  So here's John Ratcliffe just yesterday telling you what's coming next.
[00:25:17.787 --> 00:25:25.872]  So, I mean, the fact that you did have others writing the report and now we see that, do you think people understand that?
[00:25:26.253 --> 00:25:29.375]  Andrew Weissman was what, a Hillary Clinton donor?
[00:25:29.415 --> 00:25:31.236]  He was at her election party, right?
[00:25:33.499 --> 00:25:35.060]  It's not just Andrew Weissman.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:44.024]  Aaron Zebley represented Hillary Clinton's aide that set up the unsecure server and smashed her blackberries with a hammer.
[00:25:45.505 --> 00:25:51.448]  There were all sorts of folks, again, that were close to the Clinton Foundation.
[00:25:52.568 --> 00:25:55.570]  So the bias that was involved there, I think,
[00:25:56.970 --> 00:26:08.316]  Fair things to talk about, and I think that's why that, in light of the disastrous testimony from Robert Mueller, you know, the Democrats paid a heavy price for bringing a reluctant witness to testify.
[00:26:09.097 --> 00:26:19.362]  They overplayed their hand, and they did it in front of the American people on a national television audience, and it was just a train wreck of a week for the Democrats, and it was a great week for Donald Trump because of that.
[00:26:19.742 --> 00:26:31.610]  But to your point, Maria, now the things that Bob Mueller said he didn't know about and his team clearly didn't look at, those are things that would be fair for Bill Barr and the Department of Justice to look at.
[00:26:32.471 --> 00:26:38.635]  Because we know that things happened in the Obama administration that haven't been answered.
[00:26:38.695 --> 00:26:40.576]  There's been no accountability for that yet.
[00:26:40.656 --> 00:26:41.417]  That's what I want to talk about.
[00:26:42.057 --> 00:26:43.458]  And here's why things are different now.
[00:26:44.639 --> 00:26:45.960]  Trump already knows all this stuff.
[00:26:46.974 --> 00:26:50.576]  He knew that when Admiral Rogers, head of the NSA, came and told him three years ago when he was president-elect.
[00:26:52.638 --> 00:26:59.082]  But Trump has to go through the process, and he doesn't violate national security rules, even though he's the president, and is allowed to change them when he wants to.
[00:26:59.362 --> 00:27:01.304]  In the executive, that's a very powerful position.
[00:27:01.484 --> 00:27:06.367]  But the president is an elected dictator, to a certain extent, over the executive, unless Congress removes him.
[00:27:06.987 --> 00:27:08.789]  But he reportedly works for us to execute.
[00:27:09.673 --> 00:27:16.278]  And if he wants to start executing, boy, it'll look really bad for the establishment because they all committed giant crimes believing he'd never get in office.
[00:27:16.558 --> 00:27:19.721]  Then once he got in office, they believed, oh my God, he's got to have some dirt on him.
[00:27:19.741 --> 00:27:24.744]  Let's find it and set him up, while our Justice Department, that we'll keep in charge, sends him down the river.
[00:27:24.824 --> 00:27:31.329]  But he wasn't corrupt, and now your people are getting taken out of power, and every day that clicks by, you get in a worse position.
[00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:34.572]  Here's part of what the President, again, said on Friday at a press conference about it.
[00:27:35.421 --> 00:27:39.986]  We want to find out what happened with the last Democrat president.
[00:27:40.266 --> 00:27:43.389]  Let's look into Obama the way they've looked at me from day one.
[00:27:43.449 --> 00:27:45.952]  They've looked into everything that we've done.
[00:27:47.293 --> 00:27:50.256]  They could look into the book deal that President Obama made.
[00:27:50.697 --> 00:27:52.438]  Let's subpoena all of his records.
[00:27:52.539 --> 00:27:55.462]  Let's subpoena all of the records having to do with
[00:27:55.962 --> 00:28:01.605]  Hillary Clinton and all of the nonsense that went on with Clinton and her foundation and everything else.
[00:28:02.065 --> 00:28:03.346]  We could do that all day long.
[00:28:03.426 --> 00:28:06.587]  Frankly, the Republicans were gentlemen and women.
[00:28:06.747 --> 00:28:12.870]  When we had the majority in the House, they didn't do subpoenas all day long.
[00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.131]  They didn't do what these people have done.
[00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:16.452]  What they're doing is a disgrace.
[00:28:16.492 --> 00:28:17.993]  So destructive to our country.
[00:28:18.353 --> 00:28:20.414]  And I think that's why we're going to take back the House.
[00:28:21.214 --> 00:28:24.376]  That's why we're easily going to hold the President.
[00:28:24.396 --> 00:28:24.676]  That's good.
[00:28:25.521 --> 00:28:33.443]  Except next hour, Mr. President, I'm going to lay out the computer scientists, the head people from DARPA that have been exposing it, the whistleblowers.
[00:28:33.923 --> 00:28:34.504]  No, you're not.
[00:28:35.524 --> 00:28:42.626]  Because they can clearly get 10, 20 million people to vote and keep others from voting with their algorithms and systems, and they're going to do it.
[00:28:43.406 --> 00:28:46.047]  They were so arrogant in 2016, they only implemented part of it.
[00:28:46.407 --> 00:28:46.927]  Now they are.
[00:28:47.867 --> 00:28:48.388]  We come back.
[00:28:48.828 --> 00:28:55.698]  Democrats calling for violence, calling for all-out war, calling for their New World Order.
[00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:57.179]  It's all coming up.
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:28:59.342]  Huge events happening every day.
[00:28:59.362 --> 00:29:01.025]  We have entered the fulcrum.
[00:29:06.459 --> 00:29:07.921]  Let's go with Aaron in Alabama.
[00:29:07.941 --> 00:29:08.722]  Thanks for calling, Aaron.
[00:29:08.742 --> 00:29:09.163]  You're on the air.
[00:29:09.303 --> 00:29:09.844]  Hey, Alex.
[00:29:09.944 --> 00:29:13.949]  I want to say I've been in broadcasting, or I was, for about 15 years as a programmer.
[00:29:14.049 --> 00:29:16.513]  And to be honest, I hadn't heard of you until about six months ago.
[00:29:16.553 --> 00:29:18.255]  And I'm very thankful that I found you.
[00:29:18.275 --> 00:29:21.820]  You touch on a lot of stuff that I've felt in my heart and soul for my whole life.
[00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.161]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[00:29:23.241 --> 00:29:23.641]  Exactly.
[00:29:23.661 --> 00:29:24.662]  We're all kindred spirits.
[00:29:24.822 --> 00:29:25.363]  We really are.
[00:29:25.383 --> 00:29:25.843]  We really are.
[00:29:25.863 --> 00:29:27.525]  And listen, I've got a couple of points to make.
[00:29:27.545 --> 00:29:30.207]  But first, I've had body pain all over my entire life.
[00:29:30.347 --> 00:29:32.629]  And you know the product better than anybody there, I think.
[00:29:32.869 --> 00:29:33.730]  What would you recommend?
[00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:36.552]  I mean, literally, it's joint, it's muscle, it's everything.
[00:29:36.632 --> 00:29:38.413]  What would you recommend for me to purchase?
[00:29:38.433 --> 00:29:41.876]  You know, I think X2 or X3, because that's a building block to everything.
[00:29:41.896 --> 00:29:43.658]  And if you don't have that, the bad halogens take over.
[00:29:43.698 --> 00:29:45.919]  And I would think Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:29:45.979 --> 00:29:47.241]  Turmeric is amazing.
[00:29:47.281 --> 00:29:48.782]  This is a very strong extract.
[00:29:48.882 --> 00:29:49.943]  One of the strongest out there.
[00:29:49.963 --> 00:29:51.544]  Probably the strongest, but there may be one stronger.
[00:29:53.459 --> 00:29:55.901]  I would think Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:29:56.061 --> 00:30:00.043]  They've all bombarded us with synthetic hormones that mess up our body.
[00:30:00.123 --> 00:30:07.108]  But then, if you get Preglanone, in my experience, I'm no doctor, I just talk to the scientists, with these other herbs like Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:30:07.188 --> 00:30:12.932]  I think you should go through the products, every body is different, and test stuff out for yourself, and then just see what works best for you.
[00:30:12.972 --> 00:30:18.015]  But they're all super game-changing, the best we can get, the best labs, the cleanest.
[00:30:18.135 --> 00:30:20.997]  Just like, whatever is the most proven, the best, I go produce it.
[00:30:21.338 --> 00:30:21.678]  That's it.
[00:30:21.718 --> 00:30:23.159]  Because I would, I'm gonna say this again,
[00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:24.940]  I'm a very superstitious person.
[00:30:25.701 --> 00:30:26.681]  And by that, I'm God-fearing.
[00:30:27.322 --> 00:30:28.643]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:30:28.663 --> 00:30:29.743]  You've got my total commitment.
[00:30:29.983 --> 00:30:36.968]  Anything I do, information, any of it, products, like they went out and tested, third parties did, Alexa Pure and Pro Pure.
[00:30:37.108 --> 00:30:38.529]  Some are better at this, some are better at that.
[00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:42.692]  People are like, wow, we tested 30 gravity-fed filters and you have like the two best.
[00:30:42.992 --> 00:30:43.973]  Why'd I do that?
[00:30:44.113 --> 00:30:45.654]  What the hell do you think I'm doing?
[00:30:45.734 --> 00:30:56.681]  I go out and find out what is the best price for the best quality, because there's always like some space-age $5,000 thing that's better, but I look at a line of like, what is the lowest price for the best benefit, and that's what I promote.
[00:30:56.801 --> 00:30:58.583]  So, so, that's my advice on that.
[00:30:58.683 --> 00:30:59.203]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:30:59.583 --> 00:31:05.907]  Well, and I appreciate that, and I can tell just from the way you talk about the product, I feel like I can trust you that you kind of do things the way I do.
[00:31:05.947 --> 00:31:07.889]  You either do it right the first time, or just don't do it.
[00:31:07.989 --> 00:31:09.410]  And I feel like I can trust you on your product.
[00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:16.675]  Well, now listen, don't trust me, because here's the deal, is you need to talk to a physician, you need to research, because the iodine conspiracy is everything.
[00:31:16.895 --> 00:31:21.478]  Most people have almost none of it, but if you've had none of it for 20 years, you take a bunch, you could have some issues.
[00:31:21.638 --> 00:31:22.799]  Detoxing, you name it.
[00:31:22.859 --> 00:31:24.440]  I mean, this stuff, this is it, man.
[00:31:26.161 --> 00:31:27.041]  This is dangerous.
[00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:27.841]  It's dangerous.
[00:31:28.042 --> 00:31:30.742]  Because it's an element you've got to have, they've taken away from you.
[00:31:30.802 --> 00:31:32.643]  Well, what happens when you finally get it?
[00:31:32.663 --> 00:31:33.403]  You've got to be careful.
[00:31:33.483 --> 00:31:37.284]  Because if you've not had this, your body will take in bromine, chloride, fluoride.
[00:31:37.364 --> 00:31:38.884]  There's a whole bunch of bad halogens.
[00:31:40.085 --> 00:31:43.966]  Your organs, everything operates, your hormones are produced with halogen.
[00:31:44.066 --> 00:31:47.667]  And so the globalists have been targeting that with bad halogens that block it.
[00:31:47.727 --> 00:31:48.687]  So this is the good thing.
[00:31:48.727 --> 00:31:51.688]  But like anybody knows, it's like being punched in the head by a mule.
[00:31:51.708 --> 00:31:52.968]  It's like, oh, that's the real thing.
[00:31:53.008 --> 00:31:53.868]  Yeah, that's the mule.
[00:31:54.008 --> 00:31:55.909]  So I'm just telling people, this X2 isn't a joke.
[00:31:56.049 --> 00:31:57.670]  We just researched what the globalists are doing.
[00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:58.630]  We do the opposite.
[00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:04.312]  But yes, everyone with X2, X3, you need to consult a physician, because you're like, oh, that's just Mother Nature.
[00:32:04.332 --> 00:32:05.412]  Yeah, Mother Nature.
[00:32:05.533 --> 00:32:09.434]  The drug companies and all the stuff they do is a counterfeit of what God's already given us, okay?
[00:32:12.559 --> 00:32:20.722]  Most iodine is bound to iron or copper or lead or something else.
[00:32:20.782 --> 00:32:21.622]  You don't get it.
[00:32:21.702 --> 00:32:24.344]  Pure iodine is explosive.
[00:32:24.604 --> 00:32:25.624]  So yeah, be careful.
[00:32:25.784 --> 00:32:27.065]  Iodine, you have to have.
[00:32:27.805 --> 00:32:29.566]  It's just paramount.
[00:32:30.147 --> 00:32:32.008]  And so, that's why we sell it.
[00:32:32.088 --> 00:32:35.590]  That's why we've hyped it up, because it's what they don't want you to have.
[00:32:35.631 --> 00:32:44.857]  But yeah, if you've been off of it and not had an eye on it for your whole life, it's like if you've ever been in a boxing ring and you get in the ring with Mike Tyson, your body's gonna be like, what the hell is that?
[00:32:45.157 --> 00:32:46.458]  Because you've never had it.
[00:32:46.638 --> 00:32:47.538]  It's just iodine.
[00:32:47.618 --> 00:32:49.359]  It's the magic sauce, folks.
[00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:51.921]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:32:51.941 --> 00:32:56.223]  Thank you for shopping and getting great products, and it helps fund this operation.
[00:32:56.383 --> 00:32:59.004]  A total 360 win, and you know I love those.
[00:33:06.428 --> 00:33:09.070]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.486 --> 00:33:33.389]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:34.449 --> 00:33:39.173]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:49.219]  Make no mistake, this is the Second American Revolution, 1776 worldwide.
[00:33:49.339 --> 00:33:51.381]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:33:55.615 --> 00:33:59.776]  I'm gonna get into the latest Chi-Com funded, and that's literally who funds it.
[00:34:00.316 --> 00:34:01.757]  I'm gonna explain all that next segment.
[00:34:02.557 --> 00:34:03.597]  Race war garbage.
[00:34:04.497 --> 00:34:16.141]  With Elijah Cummings, who runs the district that's in the poorest part of Baltimore, Maryland, where they literally treat the people worse than animals.
[00:34:17.581 --> 00:34:20.282]  And then Elijah Cummings will play a video of him breaking down and
[00:34:21.808 --> 00:34:25.530]  Crying and yelling and screaming at the head of the Border Patrol, the head of ICE.
[00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:29.893]  Saying you're abusing, you have children crapping in their diapers.
[00:34:29.913 --> 00:34:31.554]  What's what kids do is they crap in their diapers.
[00:34:31.994 --> 00:34:33.335]  You change them, you dumb bastard.
[00:34:33.856 --> 00:34:34.456]  Excuse me, Lord.
[00:34:34.476 --> 00:34:35.637]  Nothing wrong with bastards.
[00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:37.798]  I don't want to compare them to Roger Cummings.
[00:34:38.058 --> 00:34:43.842]  They're now saying that Trump is saying that black people are rats.
[00:34:44.642 --> 00:34:47.604]  No, Trump was clear as a clear blue sky.
[00:34:50.546 --> 00:34:53.667]  He said, stop saying the Border Patrol's doing a terrible job.
[00:34:54.947 --> 00:34:58.388]  Clean up your own fetid blue city.
[00:35:00.368 --> 00:35:03.849]  We know blue cities by the piles of feces, the homeless, and the rats.
[00:35:04.689 --> 00:35:10.030]  And the plague, and the typhus, and the gang-banging, and the shooting, and the killing.
[00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.671]  Well, they vault even a CNN host.
[00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:13.591]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:31.117]  Is there no end to how deceptive the Democrats are?
[00:35:31.457 --> 00:35:33.298]  We're killing people on the southern border.
[00:35:34.038 --> 00:35:35.399]  We're making them drink out of toilets.
[00:35:35.419 --> 00:35:36.039]  None of it's true.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.461]  They're coming and abusing the asylum system.
[00:35:40.481 --> 00:35:44.043]  And there's a new video we'll play next segment of the Border Patrol.
[00:35:45.862 --> 00:35:48.946]  And a checkpoint that is an approved asylum point.
[00:35:49.447 --> 00:35:59.700]  I mean, they were about a third of a mile away from the approved point, but the former head of the Border Patrol said, you come turn yourself in for asylum at an approved point, you get taken into custody and checked, and then it gets reviewed.
[00:36:00.461 --> 00:36:01.482]  And most people get to stay here!
[00:36:02.534 --> 00:36:04.295]  We're the most wide-open country in the world for that.
[00:36:04.956 --> 00:36:06.477]  That turns into killing people.
[00:36:06.717 --> 00:36:10.300]  The Border Patrol giving them food, patting kids on the head, loading them on the trucks.
[00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:17.124]  They came to us, but now the right wing's all mad, going, oh my God, you're supposed to, you know, throw them back over the fence.
[00:36:17.304 --> 00:36:18.065]  It's the law.
[00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:19.126]  We have to change the law.
[00:36:19.566 --> 00:36:28.152]  But that video's coming up next segment, as well, of the people show up at the right general sector.
[00:36:28.192 --> 00:36:30.454]  You know, there's approved points of entry.
[00:36:32.153 --> 00:36:34.234]  And they just let them in.
[00:36:34.254 --> 00:36:37.255]  Because they're in 120 degree temperatures.
[00:36:37.275 --> 00:36:39.135]  And there's little kids with them.
[00:36:40.816 --> 00:36:42.597]  And that's the policy and the law and they let them in.
[00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:47.818]  Now here's footage shot months ago of what people at night pouring across.
[00:36:48.158 --> 00:36:49.979]  Most of them men, guns, you name it.
[00:36:50.659 --> 00:36:51.379]  It's just insane.
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.200]  So that's all coming up.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.861]  The Elijah Cummings freaking out.
[00:36:56.481 --> 00:37:01.463]  The Border Patrol footage where the people show up in the general right area and they just let them in and pat them on the head.
[00:37:03.496 --> 00:37:07.419]  And then the claims that Trump is saying black people are rats.
[00:37:07.699 --> 00:37:08.660]  And that'll be a new thing.
[00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:13.303]  He doesn't just say that Mexicans are all criminals.
[00:37:13.723 --> 00:37:15.905]  He says black people are rats and roaches.
[00:37:18.407 --> 00:37:20.948]  Flashback Bernie Sanders compares Baltimore to third world country.
[00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:25.792]  The rats, the garbage, the collapsing homes, the burning cars.
[00:37:26.913 --> 00:37:30.015]  But when Trump says it... Now there's the video I want to play right there.
[00:37:30.495 --> 00:37:31.316]  That guy crying.
[00:37:33.078 --> 00:37:35.620]  I mean, this is all insane, but let me get to this right now.
[00:37:37.001 --> 00:37:39.323]  This story is up on Infowars.com and needs to be shared.
[00:37:39.503 --> 00:37:45.187]  MSNBC tells Democrats, we are at war with unindicted criminal Trump.
[00:37:47.128 --> 00:37:50.631]  And they say, it's time to stop playing by the rules.
[00:37:52.692 --> 00:37:56.315]  Whatever we have to do, we're not going to necessarily play fair.
[00:37:57.035 --> 00:38:00.718]  As if the Democrats that founded the KKK ever played fair.
[00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:13.658]  They say that the American flag, our first flag, made by Betsy Ross, who was like one of the head abolitionists in the country at the time, you know, the ones that ended slavery worldwide.
[00:38:14.339 --> 00:38:15.420]  England was the first to do it.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.641]  Came out of England, abolitionism spread here.
[00:38:18.242 --> 00:38:19.923]  They call that a slave flag.
[00:38:22.225 --> 00:38:24.386]  Again, it's an upside-down world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:26.408 --> 00:38:27.729]  And so that's how they operate.
[00:38:28.169 --> 00:38:30.171]  So let's go ahead and play this incredible clip.
[00:38:30.993 --> 00:38:33.834]  Of where they say, we're going to start cheating.
[00:38:34.995 --> 00:38:35.955]  Oh, like you started breathing?
[00:38:36.896 --> 00:38:39.737]  And I love Donny Deutch or whatever his stupid name is.
[00:38:39.857 --> 00:38:41.618]  I mean, what a punk, man.
[00:38:42.098 --> 00:38:43.219]  Trump will never be elected.
[00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:44.519]  Trump will be out in six months.
[00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:45.780]  All of it alone.
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.420]  These people, by the way, have almost no ratings.
[00:38:47.761 --> 00:38:49.001]  Their average show has 200,000 viewers.
[00:38:51.906 --> 00:38:58.132]  Before they shadow-banned me on Facebook and Twitter, my average live video had 2 million views.
[00:38:58.772 --> 00:39:00.194]  Hillary lost, they shadow-banned me.
[00:39:00.494 --> 00:39:01.795]  Average video had 100,000 views.
[00:39:01.835 --> 00:39:02.596]  Then they totally banned me.
[00:39:02.816 --> 00:39:04.498]  Because you can't compete, you schmucks.
[00:39:04.818 --> 00:39:06.780]  No one wants to watch you, Donnie Douche.
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.381]  No one wants to hear you.
[00:39:08.942 --> 00:39:15.688]  Everyone hates you except the few mental patients that watch your show or people tuning in to get the talking points to go out and lie.
[00:39:17.009 --> 00:39:17.450]  So here he is.
[00:39:18.382 --> 00:39:24.684]  And what you said in a couple of minutes yesterday to me is the most important thing that's ever been said on this show.
[00:39:24.704 --> 00:39:26.104]  He's almost psycho, Joe.
[00:39:26.164 --> 00:39:28.385]  And that we are at war.
[00:39:28.965 --> 00:39:32.126]  It is time for the Democrats to wake up.
[00:39:32.426 --> 00:39:38.728]  We are playing against cheaters and liars or stealers and with all due respect... Hit pause, back it up ten seconds.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:42.960]  You've been at war with this country.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:43.581]  You're the globalist.
[00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:44.681]  You're on the Chi-Com payroll.
[00:39:45.001 --> 00:39:46.202]  Hollywood's owned by the Chi-Coms.
[00:39:46.822 --> 00:39:49.803]  MSNBC's parent company has billions of Chinese money coming in.
[00:39:50.264 --> 00:39:54.365]  The new Tom Cruise movie coming out.
[00:39:55.066 --> 00:39:57.427]  Covered up Japanese and Taiwanese flags in it.
[00:39:57.487 --> 00:39:57.867]  Top Gun 2.
[00:39:59.407 --> 00:40:00.348]  You're a foreign enemy.
[00:40:00.388 --> 00:40:01.468]  You are the enemy, boy!
[00:40:01.488 --> 00:40:07.271]  And you're just... Oh, it's time for us to say we're at war with Trump!
[00:40:07.331 --> 00:40:09.592]  You mean America, you scumbag!
[00:40:09.812 --> 00:40:10.192]  Here he is.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.301]  I think?
[00:40:28.368 --> 00:40:31.029]  A government led by Moskovich and criminal Trump.
[00:40:31.089 --> 00:40:38.632]  Oh, by the way, we're going to call him unindicted criminal Trump now because in two instances, he has been an unindicted criminal.
[00:40:38.892 --> 00:40:42.393]  So, I know in regular, when you're playing fair, you're supposed to call him President Trump.
[00:40:42.853 --> 00:40:45.854]  Just like we're going to call him Moskovich, we're going to call him criminal Trump.
[00:40:46.235 --> 00:40:48.155]  And another message for the Democrats.
[00:40:48.756 --> 00:40:51.336]  It is time to move forward.
[00:40:51.777 --> 00:40:55.038]  There are two takeaways from Mueller that we're going to use as we go to war.
[00:40:55.698 --> 00:41:02.260]  Number one, the president broke the law, and when he's out of office, he can go and will go to jail.
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:07.241]  And number two, we are vulnerable with our election systems.
[00:41:07.562 --> 00:41:08.622]  That's our two things.
[00:41:08.762 --> 00:41:15.944]  We may not have won the battle of impeachment, but we're going to win the war of putting him in jail, whatever we have to do.
[00:41:16.064 --> 00:41:17.624]  And we're not going to necessarily play fair.
[00:41:17.684 --> 00:41:22.706]  And for all the intellectuals out there whose hair is going to go on fire, but we're becoming like them, we're becoming like them.
[00:41:24.787 --> 00:41:26.589]  We cannot lose the next election.
[00:41:26.629 --> 00:41:29.032]  We will go back 50 years.
[00:41:29.852 --> 00:41:42.286]  But that's the problem is that they've been cheating all along and now Google and all of them are 200 million accounts on Facebook and Instagram that supported the president all annihilated.
[00:41:43.749 --> 00:41:44.289]  200 million!
[00:41:44.489 --> 00:41:45.249]  I wouldn't count them up.
[00:41:45.609 --> 00:41:47.890]  It was reported on Friday, it was like 120 million.
[00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.390]  It's 200 million today.
[00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:56.792]  As of three hours ago, I spent 30 minutes going through and checking all these accounts and looking and adding the numbers up on a calculator.
[00:41:56.812 --> 00:42:00.413]  On a big ol' fat business calculator.
[00:42:01.233 --> 00:42:05.294]  And I've shot an emergency report to the President.
[00:42:05.954 --> 00:42:08.434]  200 million followers that followed his pro accounts on Twitter.
[00:42:08.454 --> 00:42:11.175]  I mean, excuse me, on Facebook and on Instagram.
[00:42:11.215 --> 00:42:11.455]  Gone.
[00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:21.499]  But listen, all of you watching on local TV stations, all of you listening on the internet, all of you at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, you can overpower them today.
[00:42:22.279 --> 00:42:37.163]  Pick up the phone, call 10 people and say they're censoring nationalistic conservatives, they're pulling down American flags, they're saying we shouldn't have American flags on campuses, major universities are saying don't say America or American, it's the new N-word, and they're saying we can't have Alex Jones, he's at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:42:37.584 --> 00:42:38.724]  He's at NewsWars.com.
[00:42:39.384 --> 00:42:45.249]  You're not going to stop the American people or anybody around the world from what they want to listen and what they want to hear, because we built our own TV network.
[00:42:45.409 --> 00:42:46.590]  We have our satellite feeds.
[00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:47.571]  We have our crew.
[00:42:47.751 --> 00:42:53.476]  And we're standing strong against this when everybody else is going to be off the air before the election, unless Trump does something.
[00:42:53.897 --> 00:42:55.818]  My God, they're calling for violent war!
[00:42:56.218 --> 00:42:57.359]  They're saying, shut everyone up!
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.882]  And we put up with these thugs, these gangsters!
[00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:18.306]  You know, the top Nazi, Werner Von Braun, wrote a 1959 book, or 1949 book, I'm going from memory here, called Project Mars, where the Elons are the aliens who end up taking over the Earth.
[00:43:18.486 --> 00:43:21.926]  Beware the Elons, and the Elon invasion.
[00:43:22.186 --> 00:43:23.527]  Dr. Werner Von Braun.
[00:43:23.687 --> 00:43:24.347]  Wonder what he knew.
[00:43:24.507 --> 00:43:31.228]  When I watched his promo about this, with executives from his company, they all look like they're on hardcore drugs.
[00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:33.949]  I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up,
[00:43:35.805 --> 00:43:37.127]  I mean, they look nuts.
[00:43:37.487 --> 00:43:38.669]  You know when somebody's on drugs.
[00:43:38.689 --> 00:43:42.354]  You know, they admit Silicon Valley is into hardcore speed and hallucinogens.
[00:43:42.494 --> 00:43:45.958]  They're taking IV drips at work of DMT.
[00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:51.125]  They're taking LSD microdoses and psilocybin mushrooms and peyote every day!
[00:43:51.486 --> 00:43:52.767]  Who in the hell...
[00:43:53.348 --> 00:43:54.608]  Would want to join with these people.
[00:43:54.688 --> 00:43:57.169]  I've seen people take like three hits of acid, their eyes aren't that big.
[00:43:57.229 --> 00:43:58.089]  What the hell are they on?
[00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:12.914]  And one of the crew members said maybe they've already got this whole Neuralink virus hooks in their brain because as PKD pointed out, Philip K. Dick back in the 70s, the cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want, just plug in, but no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days.
[00:44:12.934 --> 00:44:16.435]  You just die because you just plug all this in and it's the Matrix.
[00:44:16.655 --> 00:44:18.876]  And now the Matrix is here and you look at Tim Cook,
[00:44:19.096 --> 00:44:22.057]  Or Elon Musk or any of his executives when they're up there on that stage.
[00:44:22.217 --> 00:44:23.617]  They'll be under white lights.
[00:44:23.837 --> 00:44:25.978]  Their pupils are 90% open.
[00:44:26.478 --> 00:44:29.219]  Zuckerberg, all of them, these people either have brain chips.
[00:44:29.439 --> 00:44:29.919]  That's it.
[00:44:30.279 --> 00:44:32.379]  These guys are wireheads.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:34.080]  Something's going on.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.501]  I'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils are very little.
[00:44:38.601 --> 00:44:39.481]  Now zoom in a bit again.
[00:44:39.521 --> 00:44:41.402]  My pupils are tiny because I'm not on drugs.
[00:44:42.122 --> 00:44:43.382]  I've had two cups of coffee today.
[00:44:43.582 --> 00:44:45.223]  So here, let me show you my pupils, okay?
[00:44:45.443 --> 00:44:46.663]  My pupils are little.
[00:44:46.723 --> 00:44:47.863]  They're supposed to close!
[00:44:48.023 --> 00:44:50.944]  That's what happens under the sun or under bright lights, but not these guys.
[00:44:51.004 --> 00:44:56.565]  These are drug addicts, and they want the hit of wires in their brains, and all of them have got those giant pupils.
[00:44:57.725 --> 00:44:59.966]  Because they've been there, and they ain't coming back.
[00:45:02.946 --> 00:45:03.646]  This is important.
[00:45:04.967 --> 00:45:05.427]  I'm 45 years old.
[00:45:07.298 --> 00:45:10.279]  When I was 35, I swam to two miles a day sometimes.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.800]  And would jog.
[00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.321]  And couldn't lose weight.
[00:45:14.201 --> 00:45:16.742]  Because I didn't have the missing links.
[00:45:16.943 --> 00:45:21.525]  I was deficient in things that nobody ever told me I was deficient in.
[00:45:22.205 --> 00:45:27.368]  I knew all about the Private Federal Reserve, the Trilateral Commission, the New World Order, Jeffrey Epstein, the pedophile rings.
[00:45:27.688 --> 00:45:32.630]  I knew all about geopolitical systems, and the old Soviet Union, and how the globals put the Tchaikovs in.
[00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.571]  But I didn't know about PQQ.
[00:45:35.251 --> 00:45:36.132]  I didn't know about CoQ10.
[00:45:37.719 --> 00:45:41.562]  I didn't know about all this, and I didn't know about Clean Iodine.
[00:45:42.642 --> 00:45:44.203]  And yeah, I want to fund my operation.
[00:45:45.324 --> 00:45:53.570]  I want you to get products that have changed my life, and changed so many other people's lives, that have 98% reviews, and then experience that I'm not BSing you.
[00:45:54.370 --> 00:46:00.374]  So that for some of you, maybe in the first time in your life, you're going to experience somebody that treats you like they want to be treated.
[00:46:00.394 --> 00:46:01.915]  Let me tell you something right now.
[00:46:03.236 --> 00:46:04.037]  You see DNA Force?
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.721]  I went out to top manufacturers.
[00:46:06.761 --> 00:46:08.562]  They're the most respected, most highly tested.
[00:46:09.342 --> 00:46:18.427]  And I said, I want the strongest PQQ CoQ10 overall formula that has pure, non-synthetic stuff in it that's ever been put on the market.
[00:46:19.388 --> 00:46:20.828]  And they said, well, that's like a $22 each model.
[00:46:20.868 --> 00:46:23.109]  I said, I want to put $50 model in it.
[00:46:25.114 --> 00:46:26.735]  They said nobody's ever done that.
[00:46:26.795 --> 00:46:29.498]  Then I signed a contract to double the amount I was gonna buy.
[00:46:29.738 --> 00:46:33.020]  I got it down to $37 a bottle for what it cost me to make this.
[00:46:33.701 --> 00:46:34.702]  Nobody does that!
[00:46:35.602 --> 00:46:41.868]  Ladies and gentlemen, you read what's in this, and you research every ingredient in this, and then you experience it for yourself.
[00:46:42.748 --> 00:46:43.449]  It's incredible.
[00:46:45.367 --> 00:46:56.197]  InfoWars presents the David Knight Show, the Alex Jones Show, and the War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[00:46:56.737 --> 00:46:59.300]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:47:05.865 --> 00:47:08.528]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.707 --> 00:47:28.589]  All right, I gotta move fast in this segment because we're so jam-packed.
[00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.990]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:30.530]  We're live.
[00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:32.512]  It's Sunday, July 28, 2019.
[00:47:32.592 --> 00:47:33.492]  Hour number one's almost done.
[00:47:36.971 --> 00:47:38.552]  But this is the most important segment of the hour.
[00:47:39.453 --> 00:47:43.336]  Elijah Cummings is an authoritarian bully, a monster, as Trump has said.
[00:47:43.376 --> 00:47:47.659]  He's a mob boss that runs Baltimore, Maryland as a king for decades.
[00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:48.220]  It's well known.
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.201]  Trump's right about that.
[00:47:49.501 --> 00:47:54.325]  When he calls Psycho Joe Scarborough a psycho, it's because a dead intern was found with her brains bashed out in his office.
[00:47:54.785 --> 00:47:57.887]  When he calls Sleepy Joe sleepy, it's because he's always falling asleep.
[00:47:57.907 --> 00:47:59.929]  When he calls Hillary crooked, it's because she's crooked.
[00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.311]  Low energy Jeb, he's got low energy.
[00:48:04.673 --> 00:48:12.696]  Now, there have been in the last three years since Trump got in, hundreds of videos shot inside by AP, Reuters, you name it, of how nice these facilities are.
[00:48:13.296 --> 00:48:14.697]  Sand volleyball courts.
[00:48:15.197 --> 00:48:16.598]  We didn't have that when I was in high school.
[00:48:17.738 --> 00:48:18.459]  Soccer courts.
[00:48:19.139 --> 00:48:19.659]  Xbox.
[00:48:19.899 --> 00:48:20.679]  Three meals a day.
[00:48:20.779 --> 00:48:21.800]  All the snacks you can eat.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.022]  You can watch the reports at AP Reports Ice Attention Centers.
[00:48:26.042 --> 00:48:27.842]  More like summer camp than concentration camps.
[00:48:28.323 --> 00:48:29.923]  Here's CNS News exclusive video.
[00:48:30.343 --> 00:48:34.085]  Tour of Ice Attention Facility, Xbox, soccer, free phone calls and lawyers.
[00:48:35.558 --> 00:48:43.824]  That's because Elijah Cummings keeps saying that they're torturing kids, that kids are dying, that they're crapping in their diapers, which is what kids do.
[00:48:45.199 --> 00:48:52.405]  When it's totally overwhelmed so they put the men in the outside tents and the unaccompanied women and children in really nice facilities that are bankrupting our country.
[00:48:53.045 --> 00:48:55.907]  And people are pouring in, wanting asylum, trying to get in.
[00:48:56.228 --> 00:48:57.449]  We've got to vet them and see who they are.
[00:48:57.729 --> 00:48:59.110]  Ellis Island used to keep you six months.
[00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:00.291]  We keep you two weeks.
[00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:03.113]  We have the most open catchment release the world's ever seen.
[00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:05.255]  Trump wants that law changed to stop this flood.
[00:49:06.596 --> 00:49:09.998]  But they turn it into concentration camps, drinking out of toilets, people dying.
[00:49:10.639 --> 00:49:13.360]  Here's Elijah Cummings flipping out at one of the heads of ICE.
[00:49:13.701 --> 00:49:15.162]  And that's what Trump responded to.
[00:49:15.782 --> 00:49:18.284]  Just saying, man, take care of Baltimore, dude.
[00:49:19.805 --> 00:49:25.408]  It's literally, Orkin says it's the number two most rat-infested city in the country.
[00:49:26.589 --> 00:49:29.271]  And just boarded up, abandoned buildings everywhere.
[00:49:29.311 --> 00:49:30.772]  It's as bad as Detroit in many areas.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:38.863]  Oh, but instead of taking responsibility for another blue city being a cesspit, oh, oh, you mean black people are rats?
[00:49:39.544 --> 00:49:40.624]  And that's the CNN clips.
[00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:42.565]  There's so many clips, I can't get to them all.
[00:49:42.625 --> 00:49:43.725]  CNN reporters crying.
[00:49:44.366 --> 00:49:45.366]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:49:45.386 --> 00:49:47.887]  But let's go to Elijah Cummins flipping out.
[00:49:47.927 --> 00:49:48.248]  Here it is.
[00:49:51.089 --> 00:49:57.412]  When we hear about stories coming out from you and your agency that
[00:49:58.382 --> 00:50:01.983]  Everything is pretty good, and you're doing a great job.
[00:50:02.003 --> 00:50:03.683]  I guess you feel like you're doing a great job, right?
[00:50:04.703 --> 00:50:05.384]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:50:05.864 --> 00:50:08.344]  We're doing our level best in a very... What does that mean?
[00:50:08.764 --> 00:50:12.805]  What does that mean when a child is sitting in their own feces?
[00:50:14.005 --> 00:50:15.146]  Can't take a shower.
[00:50:16.006 --> 00:50:16.686]  Come on, man!
[00:50:19.827 --> 00:50:20.547]  What's that about?
[00:50:21.287 --> 00:50:25.248]  None of us would have our children in that position.
[00:50:26.414 --> 00:50:28.155]  They are human beings.
[00:50:29.155 --> 00:50:32.117]  It's not the deed that you do to a child.
[00:50:32.457 --> 00:50:33.377]  It's the memory.
[00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:35.739]  It's the memory.
[00:50:35.879 --> 00:50:36.619]  Spoken like an expert.
[00:50:37.399 --> 00:50:39.280]  We are the United States of America.
[00:50:40.241 --> 00:50:42.102]  We are the greatest country in the world.
[00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:47.424]  We are the ones that can go anywhere in the world and save people.
[00:50:48.425 --> 00:50:49.846]  Make sure that they have diapers.
[00:50:50.888 --> 00:50:52.289]  Make sure that they have two brushes.
[00:50:52.609 --> 00:50:53.130]  God, this guy's annoying.
[00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:59.654]  Make sure that they're not laying around defecating in some silver paper.
[00:51:01.195 --> 00:51:02.236]  Some silver paper.
[00:51:02.556 --> 00:51:04.778]  They used a few cage photos from Obama's era.
[00:51:06.299 --> 00:51:09.341]  Other countries, they put you in a cage where they shoot your ass trying to come in.
[00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:16.466]  Here we kiss your ass, and this bitching, whining, phoning, this poverty pimp is worth hundreds of millions of dollars since he swindles his way into Congress.
[00:51:17.426 --> 00:51:20.635]  You've got these places all falling apart, everywhere Democrats are in control.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:25.168]  Way, way, a hundred times worse than these ICE facilities, literally.
[00:51:26.621 --> 00:51:29.342]  And then they turn around and tell us we're bad.
[00:51:29.842 --> 00:51:32.843]  Now, here's a two-minute compilation from AP Reports and others.
[00:51:32.863 --> 00:51:34.783]  If you're a TV viewer, it's very powerful.
[00:51:34.803 --> 00:51:40.785]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, showing even AP saying these are like summer camps.
[00:51:40.865 --> 00:51:42.546]  British News saying these are like summer camps.
[00:51:42.846 --> 00:51:49.108]  And then we release 90% of the people, other folks that are bank robbers, rapists that we've got in the system, we send their ass back!
[00:51:49.128 --> 00:51:50.348]  And we gotta pay that money!
[00:51:51.616 --> 00:51:54.579]  But Cummings says we're torturing people in concentration camps.
[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:56.542]  Well, here's the good news, Cummings.
[00:51:56.582 --> 00:51:57.843]  Nobody wants to get in your district.
[00:51:58.083 --> 00:51:59.465]  Nobody wants to get in the blue district.
[00:52:00.126 --> 00:52:00.526]  Here it is.
[00:52:01.467 --> 00:52:06.073]  The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border.
[00:52:07.092 --> 00:52:10.775]  And that is exactly what they are.
[00:52:10.915 --> 00:52:13.738]  Two pairs of bunk beds in each bedroom and the living room.
[00:52:13.978 --> 00:52:15.279]  They are concentration camps.
[00:52:15.539 --> 00:52:27.449]  HHS provides the teens with six hours daily classroom instruction, access to arts and crafts, three meals a day and snacks, access to call centers to reconnect with family, then legal services.
[00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:33.874]  And, as the contractor running the holding facility describes, most importantly, they provide playtime.
[00:52:34.275 --> 00:52:35.596]  Is it school sports day?
[00:52:37.148 --> 00:52:45.215]  Summer camp with freshly made beds, eat all you can buffet, and the inevitable video games.
[00:52:45.415 --> 00:52:58.326]  The fact that concentration camps are now an institutionalized practice in the home of the free is extraordinarily disturbing.
[00:52:58.386 --> 00:53:03.030]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[00:53:06.457 --> 00:53:13.199]  Some protesters replaced three flags at the front of the facility with a Mexican flag and an upside-down U.S.
[00:53:13.259 --> 00:53:15.980]  flag spray-painted with abolish ice.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:22.482]  You are more concerned with a piece of cloth than people who are locked in cages.
[00:53:22.622 --> 00:53:24.622]  Show it right in front of you.
[00:53:24.662 --> 00:53:26.323]  You know there's a flag in those two cages.
[00:53:29.209 --> 00:53:38.857]  There were American flags hanging all over these facilities that children being separated from their parents in front of an American flag.
[00:53:39.137 --> 00:53:41.499]  Mr. Speaker, we do have a crisis at our border.
[00:53:41.519 --> 00:53:43.460]  It is one of morality.
[00:53:44.621 --> 00:53:50.286]  As we have seen this current strategy unfold intentional and cruelly created by the Trump administration.
[00:53:50.406 --> 00:53:53.329]  If you're not happy here, then you can leave.
[00:53:53.529 --> 00:53:54.650]  White supremacists!
[00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:56.031]  White supremacists!
[00:53:57.361 --> 00:53:58.001]  White supremacist.
[00:53:58.021 --> 00:54:08.188]  What you really mean is you're anti-white, you're super racist, but you want to be in a country founded by Europeans with Christian values, not where there's open sewage and death and thousands of murders per town a year.
[00:54:08.568 --> 00:54:10.570]  There's a lot of great people of every race, color, and creed.
[00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:11.930]  They want to come here and be Americans?
[00:54:11.970 --> 00:54:12.371]  That's great.
[00:54:12.711 --> 00:54:16.533]  You want to come here and say it sucks and jump around on Mali or whatever it is that lady's on?
[00:54:18.635 --> 00:54:22.817]  Where they took down the American flag, ran up a Mexican flag, and the city council helped do it?
[00:54:23.298 --> 00:54:23.938]  In Colorado?
[00:54:25.759 --> 00:54:26.200]  In Aurora?
[00:54:27.318 --> 00:54:27.698]  Look at this.
[00:54:28.498 --> 00:54:30.519]  Now, look, the Border Patrol follows the law.
[00:54:30.579 --> 00:54:31.820]  They follow the current law.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.181]  They're working all the time.
[00:54:34.241 --> 00:54:35.221]  It's a horrible job.
[00:54:36.761 --> 00:54:46.505]  KOLD 13 News showed what happened as asylum seekers showed up at the El Paso border sector.
[00:54:48.166 --> 00:54:54.228]  They came right up the open area where there's no fence to officially show up where you ask for asylum.
[00:54:55.711 --> 00:54:57.753]  They did what you're supposed to do.
[00:54:58.233 --> 00:54:59.495]  90% get released.
[00:55:01.216 --> 00:55:02.577]  Most never show up to the hearing.
[00:55:04.619 --> 00:55:08.823]  And they were, in minutes, given water and food and medicine and checked and processed.
[00:55:10.512 --> 00:55:11.793]  And the right wing spun it.
[00:55:11.873 --> 00:55:13.093]  Look, Trump's doing nothing.
[00:55:13.893 --> 00:55:14.794]  It's wide open.
[00:55:15.394 --> 00:55:17.555]  You've seen the former head chief last week I aired.
[00:55:17.975 --> 00:55:20.356]  They were saying, you make kids drink out of toilets, you kill kids.
[00:55:20.576 --> 00:55:21.016]  And he blew up.
[00:55:21.056 --> 00:55:22.697]  He said, I've been there in the 18-wheelers.
[00:55:22.717 --> 00:55:26.199]  You open them up, there's 20, 30 dead people and kids clutching their parents' arms.
[00:55:26.239 --> 00:55:29.260]  And the smell of those coyotes that killed them for no reason.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:32.021]  Don't you tell me I'm killing kids, you damn liar.
[00:55:33.101 --> 00:55:36.523]  You show up at the checkpoint area, they bring you in.
[00:55:36.903 --> 00:55:38.964]  And you're not a criminal, you're in the country.
[00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:43.912]  And these damn liars sit up there.
[00:55:44.052 --> 00:55:46.173]  Here, let's roll the video that's all over the news.
[00:55:46.233 --> 00:55:46.914]  Oh, look!
[00:55:47.094 --> 00:55:48.175]  They're letting everybody in.
[00:55:49.396 --> 00:55:51.597]  Why do you think the other folks show up illegally?
[00:55:51.657 --> 00:55:53.038]  Because they're smuggling drugs.
[00:55:53.419 --> 00:55:54.940]  Because they've got kids that aren't theirs.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:57.301]  Because they've got Democrats telling them, don't come in the normal way.
[00:55:57.522 --> 00:56:00.284]  Come to us, you're undocumented, so we can suck off of you.
[00:56:00.304 --> 00:56:02.545]  Go ahead and roll the audio and video.
[00:56:06.908 --> 00:56:07.669]  The media's spying on us.
[00:56:07.689 --> 00:56:08.810]  Look, they're helping them up a hill.
[00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.611]  No, that's the opening to it.
[00:56:13.132 --> 00:56:15.013]  That's the space.
[00:56:15.234 --> 00:56:17.575]  That's where people are supposed to come to it.
[00:56:17.615 --> 00:56:22.698]  Gee, that's the third of a mile from the main checkpoint.
[00:56:23.859 --> 00:56:25.560]  They were waving at them as they came across.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.161]  They weren't running.
[00:56:26.341 --> 00:56:26.781]  They let them in.
[00:56:28.142 --> 00:56:30.544]  That's the law, not the Border Patrol.
[00:56:30.584 --> 00:56:36.107]  You don't like the TSA sticking your hands down your pants while the borders open and while we pour in Islamists?
[00:56:36.127 --> 00:56:36.588]  I agree.
[00:56:36.788 --> 00:56:37.388]  Don't blame them.
[00:56:37.628 --> 00:56:38.349]  Blame Congress!
[00:56:41.803 --> 00:56:49.246]  But then Eliza Cummings, I never even had time to get to these clips, and I said I was going to get into Trump and the censorship, but I've got to get into these clips.
[00:56:49.866 --> 00:56:54.568]  CNN saying that Trump's calling blacks rats.
[00:56:55.488 --> 00:56:57.789]  When he said, you ought to take care of your people and clean all that crap up.
[00:56:58.289 --> 00:57:00.370]  Like Trump's really trying to actually get funding into those areas.
[00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:04.552]  And this evil person says it's better to have rats than be a rat.
[00:57:06.277 --> 00:57:09.682]  But first I want to play in the next five minutes, some stations don't carry it, that No Man's Land.
[00:57:10.203 --> 00:57:16.592]  The new nominee to head up the Office of National Intelligence that is going to go after the deep state Obama people and remove them.
[00:57:16.952 --> 00:57:20.077]  Former Justice Department prosecutor, member of Congress, Mr. Ratcliffe.
[00:57:20.097 --> 00:57:20.818]  We're going to play that.
[00:57:21.579 --> 00:57:22.900]  Don't forget this little 30 seconds.
[00:57:23.541 --> 00:57:25.102]  Without you, we won't be on air.
[00:57:25.222 --> 00:57:26.403]  Infowarsstore.com.

[00:57:31.607 --> 00:57:32.368]  Those are selling out.
[00:57:33.289 --> 00:57:36.952]  50% off DNA Force Plus and Brain Force Plus and SuperMetal Vitality.

[00:57:40.494 --> 00:57:42.016]  Just like our information is game changing.
[00:57:43.016 --> 00:57:44.197]  Our products are incredible.
[00:57:44.538 --> 00:57:47.140]  Infowarsstore.com or Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:47.980]  Direct to the supplements.
[00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:50.963]  We'll be back with our number two on the live Sunday broadcast.
[00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:57.051]  Let's go to James in Massachusetts.
[00:57:57.431 --> 00:57:58.111]  James, you're on the air.
[00:57:58.131 --> 00:58:00.372]  Thanks for calling.
[00:58:00.412 --> 00:58:00.992]  Hello, Alex.
[00:58:01.612 --> 00:58:03.473]  God bless General Jones.
[00:58:03.533 --> 00:58:05.714]  May you live in peace and love forever.
[00:58:05.754 --> 00:58:06.814]  In Christ's name we pray.
[00:58:06.934 --> 00:58:07.694]  God bless you, brother.
[00:58:07.915 --> 00:58:09.175]  And I'd like to thank you also.
[00:58:09.195 --> 00:58:12.516]  You know, my wife and I have been married for 17 years, and we were never able to have kids.
[00:58:12.616 --> 00:58:16.077]  And after a couple of years, we've taken the B12 and the iodine.
[00:58:16.177 --> 00:58:21.719]  And knowing about not using fluoride and not having vaccines, we have a great, healthy, vibrant six-year-old boy.
[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:23.100]  And I thank you very much for that.
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.902]  Well, you know, fluoride is meant to block fertility.
[00:58:26.363 --> 00:58:29.345]  It's the bad halogen, but iodine is associated with fertility.
[00:58:29.805 --> 00:58:30.906]  So that's a beautiful story.
[00:58:30.946 --> 00:58:31.947]  That's exciting, my friend.
[00:58:32.087 --> 00:58:36.310]  And I've got all the articles right here about IQ, fertility, being boosted on iodine.
[00:58:36.871 --> 00:58:37.331]  You name it.
[00:58:37.591 --> 00:58:41.655]  That's why the system fights to keep people from getting good iodine and other things that we talk about here.
[00:58:41.695 --> 00:58:43.936]  Even though I get it from mformorestore.com, it doesn't matter to me.
[00:58:43.996 --> 00:58:46.278]  Just research what deficiencies are doing.
[00:58:46.418 --> 00:58:49.561]  But get back to you and your wife and recap the story you were telling.
[00:58:49.761 --> 00:59:13.287]  So we've been married for 17 years and we never had any children and we bought the water filter first and we got out the fluoride and the glyphosate and then we started taking X2 and B12 and about a year or so later my wife got pregnant with our baby boy and with the iodine that she was taking and everything he's so bright and you can just see the glow in his face and he's always smiling and we just owe it all to you and you're our hero Alex.
[00:59:13.447 --> 00:59:22.894]  Well that's just beautiful brother and again it shows the system knows all this and it works to keep the people from just getting basic things the body has to have.
[00:59:22.914 --> 00:59:25.476]  You have to have vitamin C. You have to have iodine.
[00:59:25.796 --> 00:59:26.657]  You have to have water.
[00:59:26.997 --> 00:59:27.998]  You have to have oxygen.
[00:59:28.098 --> 00:59:28.558]  But instead
[00:59:28.638 --> 00:59:30.738]  The whole system works to block that.
[00:59:30.859 --> 00:59:31.899]  It's just so powerful.
[00:59:31.979 --> 00:59:33.039]  It's what we're made of.
[00:59:33.159 --> 00:59:35.320]  And I'm sitting here trying to explain this to people.
[00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.860]  We're not just making this stuff up.
[00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.160]  It's just everything.
[00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.061]  But again, the other iodines are bound.
[00:59:40.081 --> 00:59:41.201]  You don't absorb them.
[00:59:41.621 --> 00:59:43.061]  Everyone calls their iodine atomic.
[00:59:43.301 --> 00:59:45.722]  I wish everyone else was selling atomic iodine.
[00:59:45.802 --> 00:59:46.202]  They're not.
[00:59:46.362 --> 00:59:48.002]  Impowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:56.893 --> 01:00:00.867]  If you are receiving this translation, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:17.642 --> 01:00:18.622]  Good morning, Director.
[01:00:19.202 --> 01:00:22.683]  If you'll let me quickly summarize your opening statement this morning.
[01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:34.725]  You said in Volume 1 on the issue of conspiracy, the Special Counsel determined that the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.
[01:00:34.745 --> 01:00:43.347]  And then in Volume 2, for reasons that you explained, the Special Counsel did not make a determination on whether there was an obstruction of justice crime committed by the President.
[01:00:43.387 --> 01:00:43.867]  Is that fair?
[01:00:44.567 --> 01:00:44.827]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:45.387 --> 01:00:55.913]  Alright, now in explaining that special counsel did not make what you called a traditional prosecution or declination decision, the report on the bottom of page two of volume two reads as follows.
[01:00:56.553 --> 01:01:05.398]  The evidence we obtained about the president's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred.
[01:01:05.418 --> 01:01:05.898]  Accordingly,
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:11.482]  While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.
[01:01:12.063 --> 01:01:13.804]  Now, uh, I read that correctly?
[01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:14.244]  Yes.
[01:01:14.524 --> 01:01:14.684]  Alright.
[01:01:15.084 --> 01:01:23.728]  Now, your report, and today you said that at all times the special counsel team operated under, was guided by, and followed Justice Department policies and principles.
[01:01:23.768 --> 01:01:35.514]  So, which DOJ policy or principle sets forth a legal standard that an investigated person is not exonerated if their innocence from criminal conduct is not conclusively determined?
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.501]  Can you repeat the last part of that question?
[01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:38.941]  Yeah.
[01:01:39.361 --> 01:01:49.567]  Which DOJ policy or principle set forth a legal standard that an investigated person is not exonerated if their innocence from criminal conduct is not conclusively determined?
[01:01:51.548 --> 01:01:53.149]  Where does that language come from, Director?
[01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.891]  Where is the DOJ policy that says that?
[01:01:58.608 --> 01:01:59.549]  Let me make it easier.
[01:01:59.589 --> 01:02:00.791]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:02:02.633 --> 01:02:11.462]  Can you give me an example other than Donald Trump where the Justice Department determined that an investigated person was not exonerated because their innocence was not conclusively determined?
[01:02:12.923 --> 01:02:14.665]  I cannot, but this is a unique situation.
[01:02:15.506 --> 01:02:16.627]  Okay, well, time is short.
[01:02:16.647 --> 01:02:17.508]  I've got five minutes.
[01:02:17.548 --> 01:02:20.411]  Let's just leave it at you can't find it because I'll tell you why.
[01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:21.372]  It doesn't exist.
[01:02:22.486 --> 01:02:31.374]  The special counsel's job, nowhere does it say that you were to conclusively determine Donald Trump's innocence or that the special counsel report should determine whether or not to exonerate him.
[01:02:31.534 --> 01:02:41.183]  It's not in any of the documents, it's not in your appointment order, it's not in the special counsel regulations, it's not in the OLC opinions, it's not in the Justice Manual, and it's not in the principles of federal prosecution.
[01:02:41.243 --> 01:02:46.048]  Nowhere do those words appear together because respectfully, respectfully, Director,
[01:02:46.448 --> 01:02:57.176]  It was not the Special Counsel's job to conclusively determine Donald Trump's innocence or to exonerate him, because the bedrock principle of our justice system is a presumption of innocence.
[01:02:57.916 --> 01:02:58.977]  It exists for everyone.
[01:02:59.297 --> 01:03:02.500]  Everyone is entitled to it, including sitting presidents.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:10.205]  And because there is a presumption of innocence, prosecutors never, ever need to conclusively determine it.
[01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:13.168]  Now, Director, the Special Counsel applied
[01:03:13.968 --> 01:03:23.131]  This inverted burden of proof that I can't find and you said doesn't exist anywhere in the department policies, and you used it to write a report.
[01:03:23.492 --> 01:03:41.038]  And the very first line of your report, the very first line of your report says, and as you read this morning, it authorizes the special counsel to provide the attorney general with a confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions reached by the special counsel.
[01:03:41.058 --> 01:03:43.199]  That's the very first word of your report, right?
[01:03:43.459 --> 01:03:43.979]  That's correct.
[01:03:45.159 --> 01:03:46.340]  Here's the problem, Director.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.900]  The Special Counsel didn't do that.
[01:03:50.801 --> 01:03:51.941]  On Volume 1, you did.
[01:03:52.181 --> 01:04:02.143]  On Volume 2, with respect to potential obstruction of justice, the Special Counsel made neither a prosecution decision or a declination decision.
[01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:03.584]  You made no decision.
[01:04:03.644 --> 01:04:07.085]  You told us this morning and in your report that you made no determination.
[01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:11.286]  So respectfully, Director, you didn't follow the Special Counsel regulations.
[01:04:11.426 --> 01:04:12.406]  It clearly says
[01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:16.609]  Write a confidential report about decisions reached.
[01:04:17.009 --> 01:04:22.274]  Nowhere in here does it say, write a report about decisions that weren't reached.
[01:04:22.714 --> 01:04:24.255]  You wrote 180 pages.
[01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:27.478]  180 pages about decisions that weren't reached.
[01:04:27.818 --> 01:04:31.942]  About potential crimes that weren't charged or decided.
[01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:38.707]  And respectfully, respectfully, by doing that, you managed to violate every principle and the most sacred
[01:04:39.588 --> 01:04:46.891]  of traditions about prosecutors not offering extra prosecutorial analysis about potential crimes that aren't charged.
[01:04:47.331 --> 01:04:55.995]  So Americans need to know this as they listen to the Democrats and Socialists on the other side of the aisle as they do dramatic readings from this report.
[01:04:56.115 --> 01:05:01.397]  Alright folks, we're going to go to break and come back with the real clown world and so much more.
[01:05:04.502 --> 01:05:10.541]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.
[01:05:16.804 --> 01:05:18.706]  But we can't let them get away with it.
[01:05:19.246 --> 01:05:27.892]  That's why you need to go to Infowarestore.com right now and get yourself a limited edition Betsy Ross flag t-shirt, which is on sale for $17.76.

[01:06:05.074 --> 01:06:11.718]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:11.778 --> 01:06:13.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:16.161 --> 01:06:21.885]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:23.266 --> 01:06:33.653]  So, a lot of... A lot of foreign powers, a lot of special interests have used our open society
[01:06:35.219 --> 01:06:49.922]  That's why George Soros calls his criminal enterprise the Open Society Foundation to come in and wage war against the nation, to teach us to hate ourselves, to lie about our institutions, to undermine them and collapse them, not to make them better.
[01:06:50.002 --> 01:06:51.282]  I've criticized institutions.
[01:06:51.562 --> 01:06:52.702]  I've criticized bad cops.
[01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.062]  I've criticized bad politicians.
[01:06:54.402 --> 01:06:59.443]  I've gone after people trying to get rid of the Second Amendment or the right to the First Amendment, but that's not our government.
[01:07:00.824 --> 01:07:03.164]  It's the globalists that hate our form of government.
[01:07:04.266 --> 01:07:14.368]  They're the anti-government individuals, because they want to overthrow our form that's been proven to be the best form, and replace it with the lying mob rule we see today.
[01:07:15.528 --> 01:07:29.211]  Without even looking, I've got stacks of articles here, where in California, and Illinois, and Maryland, and everywhere the Democrats are in control, people are losing their
[01:07:30.729 --> 01:07:35.575]  Student loan financial aid because the unions and the lawyers are stealing all of it.
[01:07:36.336 --> 01:07:40.981]  Just like Detroit fell, the most prosperous area of our country, now the poorest.
[01:07:43.444 --> 01:07:49.131]  80,000 California students lose financial aid thanks to
[01:07:51.516 --> 01:07:52.397]  Teachers Union.
[01:07:52.877 --> 01:07:53.997]  I don't need that clip anymore, guys.
[01:07:54.438 --> 01:07:55.098]  I don't need that clip anymore.
[01:07:55.118 --> 01:07:56.099]  Can we just have a document cam shot?
[01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:56.399]  Thanks.
[01:07:57.139 --> 01:08:04.163]  So again, 80,000 California students lose financial aid thanks to Teachers Union state government.
[01:08:06.084 --> 01:08:06.644]  Think about that.
[01:08:10.046 --> 01:08:11.867]  And that's just one in my stack today.
[01:08:12.368 --> 01:08:18.251]  What you get under their control is collapse of civilization.
[01:08:19.592 --> 01:08:20.192]  And then you get
[01:08:21.738 --> 01:08:39.933]  Cummings, Elijah Cummings, always up there saying everybody's in the KKK, always saying white people are the devil, just like AOC, just spewing the most racist crap that almost no one's buying, and saying people are drinking out of toilets, they're killing kids, they're living in cages, something Obama had people doing.
[01:08:40.374 --> 01:08:41.014]  None of it's true!
[01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:48.961]  But the whole corporate media will still line up behind it, and the new thing is, Trump was calling
[01:08:52.682 --> 01:08:53.922]  Everyone in Baltimore rats.
[01:08:54.682 --> 01:08:55.283]  The black people.
[01:08:56.643 --> 01:09:03.004]  Because they're all out complaining, saying, there's all these videos saying, we see everybody getting all this free stuff and all this help from other countries.
[01:09:03.044 --> 01:09:03.724]  How about here?
[01:09:04.184 --> 01:09:05.965]  Where these people dump junk in the street.
[01:09:06.685 --> 01:09:08.305]  And they just let people shoot whoever they want.
[01:09:08.905 --> 01:09:10.446]  Elijah Cummings doesn't give a damn.
[01:09:11.786 --> 01:09:13.987]  What does Cummings do when his black constituents are saying that?
[01:09:14.007 --> 01:09:20.368]  He just goes... It's better to have rats than to be a rat like Donald Trump.
[01:09:21.718 --> 01:09:24.479]  That doesn't stop CNN anchor Victor Blackwell.
[01:09:25.879 --> 01:09:29.681]  Chokes up on air after Trump rips infested Baltimore.
[01:09:30.881 --> 01:09:34.442]  And then you read, before I get to this clip, let me show you some of these headlines.
[01:09:35.243 --> 01:09:38.904]  Trump tells black lawmaker to clean up disgusting rat and rodent infested district.
[01:09:40.117 --> 01:09:41.718]  You know, like Skid Row in L.A.
[01:09:41.758 --> 01:09:46.862]  or what's happening in San Francisco, where most of the people in San Francisco aren't black that are homeless.
[01:09:47.422 --> 01:09:48.663]  Or in Portland, they're not black.
[01:09:48.743 --> 01:09:52.466]  It's a bunch of white people on heroin and running around robbing and killing.
[01:09:52.826 --> 01:09:55.248]  The point is, is this is going on in every Democrat area.
[01:09:55.808 --> 01:10:02.073]  This wasn't about black people, other than trying to clean this area up and get jobs and businesses back in, that Trump's been trying to do.
[01:10:02.273 --> 01:10:03.133]  And that's a fact!
[01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:07.997]  But Elijah Cummings doesn't want his people to get up off their knees in front of him.
[01:10:08.177 --> 01:10:09.358]  He wants them to stay on their knees.
[01:10:12.176 --> 01:10:16.819]  Outrage as Trump brands mostly black Baltimore as infested mess.
[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:18.661]  Notice how they did the quote in Yahoo.
[01:10:19.902 --> 01:10:23.985]  He said a rat infested mess that you need to clean up for your people was the quote.
[01:10:24.505 --> 01:10:27.127]  That turns into infested mess.
[01:10:29.569 --> 01:10:32.411]  Elijah Cummins thinks the corporate media still has total power.
[01:10:33.091 --> 01:10:35.253]  He still thinks he can put out a big fat lie.
[01:10:36.934 --> 01:10:37.835]  And people are gonna believe it.
[01:10:40.387 --> 01:10:40.887]  Here's another one.
[01:10:40.927 --> 01:10:41.328]  AP.
[01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:42.689]  Trump attacks minority.
[01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:45.511]  Black district represented by a critic.
[01:10:46.311 --> 01:10:46.431]  Oh.
[01:10:48.573 --> 01:10:55.658]  When Trump tried to get industry and jobs and to make sure that the welfare actually goes to people and stolen by the mob boss Cummings.
[01:10:56.038 --> 01:10:57.399]  Cummings is under criminal investigation.
[01:10:57.459 --> 01:10:58.020]  You should know that.
[01:10:59.341 --> 01:11:02.343]  Trying to help people now turns into attacking black people.
[01:11:03.103 --> 01:11:06.506]  Hey, how about you take care of your people and clean it up and get some jobs in there?
[01:11:07.642 --> 01:11:14.950]  And all the racks and mattresses and garbage, and that turns into, by the alchemy of the AP, Trump attacks majority black district represented by Critic.
[01:11:16.852 --> 01:11:21.277]  Trump slams Cummings, brutal bully, whose Baltimore district far worse than southern border.
[01:11:22.258 --> 01:11:23.139]  That's what Trump was saying.
[01:11:25.319 --> 01:11:28.361]  Trump was saying, you're saying that we're running Nazi death camps.
[01:11:28.381 --> 01:11:29.441]  You're saying we're killing people.
[01:11:29.521 --> 01:11:31.282]  You're saying we make them drink out of toilets.
[01:11:31.302 --> 01:11:31.883]  None of that's true.
[01:11:32.143 --> 01:11:34.604]  Why don't you clean up your place that actually is a hellhole?
[01:11:35.385 --> 01:11:43.609]  You say the Border Patrol's responsible for all these crimes that aren't true, when if you're their representative and it's way worse than the border, what do you say about yourself, you hypocrite?
[01:11:45.731 --> 01:11:47.652]  Cummings, did you hear he called black people rats?
[01:11:49.059 --> 01:11:50.961]  And CNN goes, yeah, Trump called blacks rats.
[01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:56.426]  Are you insulted, whether you're white or black or whatever the hell color you are, that they lie to us like this?
[01:11:57.627 --> 01:11:58.748]  That this is what they do?
[01:11:59.509 --> 01:12:00.550]  And aren't you sick of it?
[01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:02.191]  But it gets worse.
[01:12:02.772 --> 01:12:08.437]  CNN anchor Victor Blackwell chokes up on air after Trump rips infested Baltimore.
[01:12:15.737 --> 01:12:23.682]  Cummings is like, the border patrol's horrible, the children are in hell on earth, and Trump's like, well, your own district's falling apart full of rats and garbage and drugs and death.
[01:12:24.322 --> 01:12:25.843]  Oh, you called me a rat!
[01:12:27.004 --> 01:12:29.966]  And the whole corporate media lines up to lie about it.
[01:12:31.627 --> 01:12:35.409]  But like Donnie Deutch said on MSNBC, it's time to start fighting dirty.
[01:12:35.769 --> 01:12:40.352]  Truth is, you guys are hated because you fight dirty, and everybody's finally aware of it.
[01:12:41.273 --> 01:12:42.954]  Here's the crying CNN reporter.
[01:12:43.732 --> 01:12:45.833]  There's a revolution going on in California.
[01:12:45.893 --> 01:12:52.256]  So many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous crime-infested and breeding concept.
[01:12:52.416 --> 01:12:53.697]  Infested, he says.
[01:12:54.758 --> 01:13:05.143]  The president says about Congressman Cummings' district... This is the worst acting I've ever seen.
[01:13:06.824 --> 01:13:07.244]  Hold on a second.
[01:13:08.124 --> 01:13:10.966]  ...that no human would want to live there.
[01:13:11.326 --> 01:13:12.627]  You know who did, Mr. President?
[01:13:12.787 --> 01:13:13.067]  I did.
[01:13:14.537 --> 01:13:16.587]  From the day I was brought home from the hospital.
[01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.894]  Hit pause and back it up.
[01:13:18.609 --> 01:13:19.369]  I'm gonna start from the beginning.
[01:13:19.969 --> 01:13:21.189]  This is mind control, folks.
[01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:23.770]  Trump's trying to say, clean it up, help people.
[01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:26.090]  No human should have to live there.
[01:13:26.110 --> 01:13:27.230]  It's not good conditions.
[01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:29.771]  The same stuff Cummings says about the Border Patrol that isn't true.
[01:13:29.951 --> 01:13:31.571]  You're treating these kids like animals!
[01:13:31.851 --> 01:13:33.251]  No human should put up with this!
[01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:35.792]  And Trump's like, no human should put up with what you're doing to your own people.
[01:13:36.352 --> 01:13:40.613]  And once you allow, the city doesn't even spend the money they steal to clean up garbage in the street.
[01:13:40.753 --> 01:13:42.773]  And the police won't do their job because they're leftists.
[01:13:43.013 --> 01:13:47.714]  And they're so afraid they'll get fired, so they let gangbangers kill people and attack the police!
[01:13:49.375 --> 01:13:52.536]  Then you cry about how Trump's trying to hurt you.
[01:13:52.816 --> 01:13:54.196]  Because you prey on those people.
[01:13:55.096 --> 01:13:57.217]  Anchor Victor Blackwell, here it is.
[01:13:57.917 --> 01:14:00.037]  There's a revolution going on in California.
[01:14:00.097 --> 01:14:06.478]  So many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous crime-infested and breeding concept.
[01:14:06.618 --> 01:14:07.919]  Infested, he says.
[01:14:08.959 --> 01:14:11.179]  The president says about Congressman Cummings' district.
[01:14:17.481 --> 01:14:18.721]  It is infested by leftists, too.
[01:14:19.858 --> 01:14:20.459]  By antifa.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.543]  By drugs.
[01:14:22.603 --> 01:14:25.167]  No human would want to live there.
[01:14:25.548 --> 01:14:26.830]  You know who did, Mr. President?
[01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.271]  I did.
[01:14:28.737 --> 01:14:32.761]  From the day I was brought home from the hospital, to the day I left for college.
[01:14:33.321 --> 01:14:33.822]  Poor baby.
[01:14:33.842 --> 01:14:35.904]  A lot of people I care about still do.
[01:14:36.284 --> 01:14:37.645]  There are challenges, no doubt.
[01:14:37.825 --> 01:14:38.526]  Go help them then!
[01:14:38.706 --> 01:14:40.308]  But people are proud of their community.
[01:14:40.428 --> 01:14:40.928]  Hit pause.
[01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:47.654]  I want to hear what this jackass has done, and who lives there, and I want to hear what you gave, like Obama.
[01:14:47.855 --> 01:14:50.437]  Women's like, we live in a car, we'd like a house.
[01:14:50.457 --> 01:14:51.238]  You got a car, lady.
[01:14:51.618 --> 01:14:52.699]  No Democrat got her house.
[01:14:52.839 --> 01:14:53.440]  Republicans did.
[01:14:55.913 --> 01:15:00.075]  It's always you're getting everything free, and then we collapse like Venezuela.
[01:15:00.115 --> 01:15:01.636]  Here, let's finish up with this dirt basket.
[01:15:02.036 --> 01:15:03.237]  I'm proud of their community.
[01:15:04.138 --> 01:15:10.081]  I don't want to sound self-righteous, but people get up and go to work there.
[01:15:10.701 --> 01:15:12.242]  They care for their families there.
[01:15:12.843 --> 01:15:20.087]  They love their children, who pledge allegiance to the flag, just like people who live in districts of congressmen who support you, sir.
[01:15:20.127 --> 01:15:22.028]  That is the fakest crap I've ever seen.
[01:15:22.048 --> 01:15:23.909]  So this guy is crapping all over the truth.
[01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:39.036]  And he sits there, just like all these other limousine liberals, whether they be Nancy Pelosi or any of these guys, Maxine Waters, and they come suck off their constituents, the poorest, the most down fraud, and don't do jack crap, while they're in $12,000 a night hotels.
[01:15:39.196 --> 01:15:45.359]  That's where Pelosi is over in the most expensive area of Italy right now, on a $300,000 private government jet.
[01:15:45.839 --> 01:15:46.960]  That's how much the trip's costing.
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.942]  Lecturing Trump about how he's not taking care of all these people with more free stuff
[01:15:52.782 --> 01:15:55.085]  I'm taking Trump to the woodshed in a loving way.
[01:15:55.526 --> 01:15:56.106]  We come back.
[01:15:56.146 --> 01:15:58.329]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:15:58.670 --> 01:15:59.811]  InfoWars.com.
[01:16:04.096 --> 01:16:08.942]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:16:10.242 --> 01:16:18.824]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:16:19.644 --> 01:16:30.586]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:35.467]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:16:36.387 --> 01:16:39.589]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:45.473]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:16:47.335 --> 01:16:49.436]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[01:16:50.257 --> 01:16:59.943]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:09.975 --> 01:17:16.380]  As usual, it seems like people are finally catching up to what InfoWars was breaking first.
[01:17:20.659 --> 01:17:24.481]  I was just worried that people weren't really aware of how bad it is and what's really going on.
[01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:26.622]  InfoWars has been on the front front of that fight.
[01:17:26.942 --> 01:17:29.724]  I've been on the front front of that fight, and we gotta see more.
[01:17:29.924 --> 01:17:30.665]  You know, I say this.
[01:17:30.725 --> 01:17:31.785]  I'm gonna say this about InfoWars.
[01:17:32.286 --> 01:17:34.047]  Everybody can say whatever they want.
[01:17:34.487 --> 01:17:36.368]  Alex Jones is the man, in my opinion.
[01:17:36.508 --> 01:17:37.809]  I mean, whatever you people want to say.
[01:17:37.849 --> 01:17:39.150]  I've been a fan of InfoWars.
[01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:39.810]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:40.951]  Free Alex Jones!
[01:17:41.411 --> 01:17:44.275]  Alex Jones needs to be back on social media where he belongs.
[01:17:44.455 --> 01:17:50.904]  What happened to Alex is horrific, you know, and I think that he was just sort of the litmus test for a lot of these tech companies.
[01:17:50.944 --> 01:17:54.549]  You know, I can't say I agree with every single thing that Alex has said, but that's not the point.
[01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:56.532]  That he should have his freedom of speech and he should be able to have
[01:17:56.992 --> 01:18:01.935]  And I really hope that in the future we can get him and all of the other people that have been treated so terribly by Big Tech.
[01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:32.353]  Oh, we can take him out because he's sort of the symbol of, you know, the most extreme voice out there, you know.
[01:18:32.373 --> 01:18:36.875]  And so I think to him, they targeted him and used him as an example.
[01:18:36.895 --> 01:18:38.696]  A modern-day deep person, basically.
[01:18:38.716 --> 01:18:39.776]  It's almost like a death sentence.
[01:18:39.796 --> 01:18:40.917]  You can't get your voice out there.
[01:18:41.317 --> 01:18:44.178]  But if they come after him, they can come after anyone.
[01:18:44.198 --> 01:18:46.499]  So he should have his platform just like anybody else does.
[01:18:46.919 --> 01:18:52.502]  InfoWars has given so many young people a platform in the beginning to get their voice out there.
[01:18:52.862 --> 01:19:00.224]  Luckily, Alex's and your guys' audience is so big and so loyal that they're able to follow him to, you know, his personal website or the show's website.
[01:19:00.584 --> 01:19:02.244]  But other people don't have that luxury, you know?
[01:19:02.284 --> 01:19:06.085]  If you're a smaller creator and you get de-platformed early on, no one will even know you exist.
[01:19:06.385 --> 01:19:08.146]  So, I gotta give a shout-out to InfoWars.
[01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:09.346]  I don't care what nobody else say.
[01:19:09.446 --> 01:19:10.747]  I met Alex Jones personally.
[01:19:11.067 --> 01:19:15.008]  I buy the supplements and everything, so... I just wanna give a shout-out to y'all, man.
[01:19:15.048 --> 01:19:15.908]  You don't get enough credit.
[01:19:16.465 --> 01:19:17.426]  He's a freedom fighter.
[01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:19.427]  He should be here today at the White House.
[01:19:19.507 --> 01:19:20.207]  I love you, Alex.
[01:19:20.648 --> 01:19:25.470]  Everybody knows ground zero, patient zero is InfoWars and Alex Jones.
[01:19:25.631 --> 01:19:26.211]  Everybody knows that.
[01:19:33.370 --> 01:19:41.796]  With our classic InfoWars fan favorite formula, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a must have for any info warrior serious about their oral health.
[01:19:41.896 --> 01:19:46.119]  Featuring natural oils and ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[01:19:46.259 --> 01:19:50.082]  Fueled by the good halogen iodine and high quality nano silver.
[01:19:50.302 --> 01:19:55.066]  We've taken the fluoride out and replaced it with powerful ingredients to help boost your smile.
[01:19:55.246 --> 01:19:57.247]  Don't miss out on one of our best products.
[01:19:57.427 --> 01:20:02.251]  Power up your morning routine with Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste at the InfoWars store.
[01:20:06.374 --> 01:20:10.878]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:17.484 --> 01:20:30.476]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:37.492 --> 01:20:41.093]  Well, President Trump is going to lose the 2020 election.
[01:20:41.274 --> 01:20:42.074]  It's a done deal.
[01:20:43.594 --> 01:20:45.035]  It's going to happen on this timeline.
[01:20:45.655 --> 01:20:49.417]  It's like if you're drinking three bottles of Jack Daniels a day, your liver's gonna fail.
[01:20:50.327 --> 01:20:53.489]  Smoking 10 packs of cigarettes a day, you're gonna get emphysema lung cancer.
[01:20:54.630 --> 01:20:58.632]  The big tech giants have all been caught on internal videos, Project Veritas.
[01:20:58.652 --> 01:21:00.734]  Their own statements have come out, there's been lawsuits.
[01:21:01.154 --> 01:21:16.624]  They say, oh my gosh, we already tilted it towards Hillary, we already rigged search results, but we didn't do a bunch of other stuff we thought we'd get caught, but this time we're banning anybody promoting Trump, anybody telling people to vote, and all the algorithms, all the studies, it's coming up next segment, we're gonna play some of the professors.
[01:21:17.324 --> 01:21:19.605]  Clearly show that they can steal the election.
[01:21:20.126 --> 01:21:27.250]  Trump won in a landslide in 2016, but he barely won because of the giant fraud.
[01:21:27.490 --> 01:21:31.712]  Now, let's get into it.
[01:21:33.993 --> 01:21:34.854]  It's been exponential.
[01:21:35.254 --> 01:21:40.117]  They demonized me for a good year and a half, like I was the second coming of Satan.
[01:21:41.255 --> 01:21:48.838]  On every channel in the country to demonize the internet and the idea of conservatism and nationalism and populism and to demonize Trump.
[01:21:49.118 --> 01:21:50.739]  And to try to get Trump to come out and attack me.
[01:21:51.019 --> 01:21:51.519]  It didn't work.
[01:21:52.319 --> 01:21:54.100]  And even if he did, I wasn't going to come out and attack him.
[01:21:54.140 --> 01:21:54.900]  We had that discussion.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.902]  I just said, as long as his policies are good, as long as he's trying, I don't care if he says I'm the devil if he needs to.
[01:21:59.922 --> 01:22:00.942]  Of course, he's never done that.
[01:22:02.223 --> 01:22:03.463]  He'll turn his constituents off.
[01:22:03.843 --> 01:22:05.144]  We're the core of Trump supporters.
[01:22:06.698 --> 01:22:16.382]  But I clearly knew, and a month before I got banned a year ago, it's 11 months ago, it's August 7th, all the big tech got together and decided to do it.
[01:22:16.622 --> 01:22:17.122]  They admitted it.
[01:22:18.422 --> 01:22:19.683]  They said kick him off every platform.
[01:22:19.703 --> 01:22:21.323]  Then that didn't work, so ban his name.
[01:22:21.443 --> 01:22:22.764]  Ban any positive mention of him.
[01:22:23.184 --> 01:22:24.585]  Ban InfoWars.com.
[01:22:24.605 --> 01:22:25.585]  Don't allow anybody to put it out.
[01:22:27.657 --> 01:22:31.040]  And people went along with that because they didn't want to get banned next.
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.382]  And then, oh, the folks bought that.
[01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:35.964]  Let's start banning hundreds of other people that are prominent.
[01:22:36.304 --> 01:22:40.567]  Then it was up to 800 conservative activists and people a day.
[01:22:40.587 --> 01:22:41.668]  And then it was 1,000 a day.
[01:22:41.989 --> 01:22:46.812]  And now it was 100 and something thousand Friday.
[01:22:46.832 --> 01:22:47.493]  It started Friday.
[01:22:47.573 --> 01:22:51.296]  It's 200,000 as of this afternoon when I counted it up.
[01:22:51.816 --> 01:22:54.619]  This is Donald Trump's Twitter.
[01:22:57.140 --> 01:22:57.620]  .4 million.
[01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:00.201]  Here's his Instagram.
[01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:02.002]  13.9 million followers.
[01:23:02.042 --> 01:23:02.963]  It's already shadowbanned.
[01:23:05.564 --> 01:23:09.165]  Now, the left can't meme.
[01:23:09.205 --> 01:23:11.326]  They don't want people talking via memes.
[01:23:11.827 --> 01:23:15.508]  Automatic censorship algorithms can't tell what's funny, what's not.
[01:23:16.789 --> 01:23:20.831]  They can't censor things as good as an algorithm does.
[01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:22.691]  So they need people to do it.
[01:23:23.292 --> 01:23:24.872]  Again, memes are hard to censor.
[01:23:24.892 --> 01:23:26.213]  You've got to have a person looking at it.
[01:23:27.691 --> 01:23:29.051]  So there's an article from RT.
[01:23:30.212 --> 01:23:36.273]  This is the endgame Instagram user's vent after Syke culls meme posting videos.
[01:23:36.453 --> 01:23:38.113]  I know who all these top groups are.
[01:23:38.534 --> 01:23:39.754]  Hundreds of accounts banned.
[01:23:40.314 --> 01:23:46.195]  One of the accounts had over 40 million followers.
[01:23:46.235 --> 01:23:48.736]  People that signed up to have the information sent to them.
[01:23:50.576 --> 01:23:51.217]  40 plus million.
[01:23:54.057 --> 01:23:54.597]  Think about that.
[01:23:56.298 --> 01:23:56.818]  Here's another one.
[01:23:57.850 --> 01:23:58.350]  Again, right here.
[01:23:58.951 --> 01:24:00.432]  This is SpicyMP4.
[01:24:01.252 --> 01:24:02.053]  This is the endgame.
[01:24:02.073 --> 01:24:11.000]  40-plus million followers and over $600,000 a year in all the accounts this person had, all the work they put in, blown away.
[01:24:12.721 --> 01:24:14.262]  Forget the money, it's the speech that matters.
[01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:14.662]  Gone.
[01:24:16.724 --> 01:24:17.284]  Here's another one.
[01:24:17.544 --> 01:24:18.045]  Instagram.
[01:24:18.065 --> 01:24:19.686]  You just deleted all my accounts.
[01:24:19.706 --> 01:24:22.468]  30-plus million followers.
[01:24:23.268 --> 01:24:24.049]  That just happened.
[01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:31.572]  So I'm going over all this and there's hundreds of these that add up.
[01:24:33.513 --> 01:24:47.982]  There's hundreds of these that add up to over 200 million followers banned in just the last three days.
[01:24:49.181 --> 01:24:50.482]  So it's pure exponential.
[01:24:50.522 --> 01:24:51.743]  In fact, forget exponential.
[01:24:52.064 --> 01:24:53.745]  Exponential means it's going straight up and it's doubling.
[01:24:53.985 --> 01:24:55.827]  This is like five times exponential.
[01:24:55.867 --> 01:24:56.868]  A hundred times.
[01:24:57.729 --> 01:25:00.191]  It's just they're banning everyone.
[01:25:01.132 --> 01:25:09.039]  I have family that gave a donation to Trump and, you know, has a Facebook and mainly sends around family photos.
[01:25:09.139 --> 01:25:09.819]  They're being banned.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.421]  Everyone I know is being banned.
[01:25:12.637 --> 01:25:17.338]  This is a giant scandal against the communication systems of conservatives, nationalists, Christians.
[01:25:17.558 --> 01:25:18.298]  You've heard the Democrats.
[01:25:18.338 --> 01:25:19.179]  We're going to war.
[01:25:20.119 --> 01:25:21.099]  We're going to fight dirty.
[01:25:23.079 --> 01:25:30.521]  And then institutions like Facebook and Google, who each are bigger than Ma Bell ever imagined, they're not getting broken up.
[01:25:30.701 --> 01:25:31.922]  They're not getting fought back against.
[01:25:31.982 --> 01:25:41.944]  And so they're going to the limit to suppress speech and suppress all the crazy things Democrats are doing so they can call for violence, so they can physically attack people.
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:52.466]  And so it can all be covered up, and so Elijah Cummings can run around and say that we're killing Hispanic children in death camps, and no one can respond to it.
[01:25:54.007 --> 01:25:55.808]  So the story's up on Infowars.com.
[01:25:55.828 --> 01:26:02.973]  The full message that I taped today before I went live, because I wanted to be really focused, is on Infowars.com.
[01:26:03.013 --> 01:26:04.654]  We'll show people that posting right now.
[01:26:05.114 --> 01:26:06.515]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:26:07.276 --> 01:26:09.197]  Why is President Trump committing suicide?
[01:26:12.113 --> 01:26:14.235]  Now, they won't let you spread that on Facebook or Twitter.
[01:26:14.275 --> 01:26:15.135]  It'll be instantly banned.
[01:26:15.155 --> 01:26:18.958]  But if you spread it from NewsWars.com, you won't have those problems as bad.
[01:26:19.318 --> 01:26:20.819]  So go to NewsWars.com.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.001]  Why is President Trump committing suicide?
[01:26:23.421 --> 01:26:24.842]  Alex Jones Emergency Message to 45.
[01:26:26.684 --> 01:26:29.746]  Because the President is committing political suicide.
[01:26:29.806 --> 01:26:31.047]  It's at NewsWars.com.
[01:26:31.287 --> 01:26:31.927]  Hit your email.
[01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.108]  Hit your text message.
[01:26:33.728 --> 01:26:36.170]  Facebook has text message programs.
[01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:42.474]  They're now blocking people worldwide from promoting nationalism, Christianity, and family on your own damn text messages.
[01:26:43.775 --> 01:26:45.195]  So it's even gotten to that point now.
[01:26:45.336 --> 01:26:46.736]  What will we not put up with?
[01:26:46.756 --> 01:26:51.639]  I don't have time to get to this because I've got this next segment coming up that's so important in the final segment.
[01:26:55.697 --> 01:27:00.341]  YouTube is officially telling people you can't put Christian in your tag, and you can't have Christian ads.
[01:27:00.461 --> 01:27:01.401]  That is offensive.
[01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:03.443]  They're officially saying it.
[01:27:03.463 --> 01:27:11.649]  Remember a few years ago, Google Doodle on Christmas and Easter would say nothing about Jesus, or even Christianity, or even a Christmas tree that isn't even Christian, or a bunny rabbit?
[01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:14.511]  This is a cult of control!
[01:27:16.593 --> 01:27:18.194]  And are we just going to sit here and put up with this?
[01:27:18.314 --> 01:27:21.256]  My message to the President, really taking him to the woodshed,
[01:27:22.321 --> 01:27:25.343]  Is up next, but I shot it an hour before the show.
[01:27:25.383 --> 01:27:27.104]  It was done by the time the show was on.
[01:27:27.525 --> 01:27:34.350]  It's just ten and a half minutes with all the proof and the professors and the documents and the admissions and it needs to go out as the Paul Revere bat signal.
[01:27:37.332 --> 01:27:39.313]  Why is President Trump committing suicide?
[01:27:39.333 --> 01:27:43.716]  Because let me tell you, if they get him out of office, they're going to put his ass in prison or kill him.
[01:27:43.937 --> 01:27:45.257]  This isn't just political suicide.
[01:27:45.298 --> 01:27:46.678]  I mean, I can't think of the right headline.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:48.440]  But
[01:27:49.670 --> 01:27:50.610]  This is cut and dry.
[01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:52.351]  It's not just about censorship.
[01:27:52.391 --> 01:27:53.271]  It's about cartels.
[01:27:53.311 --> 01:27:54.112]  It's about control.
[01:27:54.132 --> 01:27:54.652]  It's about evil.
[01:27:55.332 --> 01:27:57.273]  And don't forget, I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[01:27:57.313 --> 01:27:58.753]  Central with a live weekday show.
[01:27:58.813 --> 01:28:00.074]  And David Knight's on at 8 a.m.
[01:28:00.114 --> 01:28:01.874]  You've got to go to infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:28:01.894 --> 01:28:02.835]  That's where you'll find it.
[01:28:02.895 --> 01:28:04.195]  Or on local radio or TV stations.
[01:28:04.415 --> 01:28:05.415]  A lot of stations are picking us up.
[01:28:05.435 --> 01:28:06.256]  We're very thankful to them.
[01:28:06.516 --> 01:28:07.256]  Spread the word that way.
[01:28:08.096 --> 01:28:08.937]  Owen Schroeder, 3 p.m.
[01:28:08.957 --> 01:28:09.217]  every day.
[01:28:09.377 --> 01:28:10.677]  We're about to add new shows very soon.
[01:28:10.737 --> 01:28:11.438]  It's finally going to happen.
[01:28:11.758 --> 01:28:12.258]  And don't forget,
[01:28:13.029 --> 01:28:14.009]  We're going to have Clown World 2.
[01:28:14.109 --> 01:28:18.431]  Remember, that's our term for the Democrats and other peoples, but now the President's adopted it and others.
[01:28:18.871 --> 01:28:21.151]  We're going to have coverage of the two-night debate starting Tuesday night.
[01:28:21.672 --> 01:28:24.693]  Every night, with an hour before, we'll cover it live and have your phone calls after.
[01:28:25.113 --> 01:28:29.714]  Tuesday and Wednesday night, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, will be here and so much more.
[01:28:29.734 --> 01:28:32.335]  By the way, his suits for the Covington kids have not been thrown out.
[01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:34.216]  He predicted the other ones would be.
[01:28:34.496 --> 01:28:37.338]  He'll be here to talk about all that tomorrow in studio.
[01:28:37.658 --> 01:28:38.538]  He's flying in tonight.
[01:28:39.259 --> 01:28:42.480]  So, clownworld.us is the site where you'll find that.
[01:28:42.881 --> 01:28:44.241]  Clownworld.us.
[01:28:44.942 --> 01:28:45.542]  Stay with us!
[01:28:46.443 --> 01:28:54.307]  Trump's doing so much good, but if he won't stand up for his communication system and our free speech, and he's too confident, he will lose.
[01:28:54.687 --> 01:29:00.971]  I don't want him to lose, but we have to get the message and the video on infowars.com to him right now to stop these clowns.
[01:29:11.823 --> 01:29:18.588]  Ladies and gentlemen, I gotta tell you, the InfoWars Live Protein Bars are really popular around the InfoWars office.
[01:29:18.708 --> 01:29:21.810]  I mean, people around here cannot get enough of them.
[01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.571]  I'm telling you.
[01:29:22.971 --> 01:29:24.552]  In fact, myself included.
[01:29:24.852 --> 01:29:28.695]  Let me just show you why the InfoWars Live Protein Bar is so popular, man.
[01:29:28.995 --> 01:29:32.378]  This thing is like a double fudge brownie.
[01:29:32.938 --> 01:29:33.479]  Look at that!
[01:29:33.779 --> 01:29:37.602]  Wrapped in peanut butter with peanuts in the middle.
[01:29:37.982 --> 01:29:41.645]  I mean, you cannot get a better tasting protein bar than this.
[01:29:41.966 --> 01:29:46.790]  And that's why people around the InfoWars office are going crazy for them and we can't even keep them on the shelves.
[01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:49.092]  But they're on sale for 40% off right now.
[01:29:49.332 --> 01:29:58.180]  So get your InfoWars Live Protein Bar 40% off at InfoWarsStore.com and you can be just like the crew around here enjoying the best protein bar on the market.
[01:30:06.076 --> 01:30:06.462]  InfoWar
[01:30:09.997 --> 01:30:12.819]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:30:12.879 --> 01:30:21.925]  You see Pelosi acting like she's dissing herself from AOC, but that's really the globalist policies AOC just does in the ham-pissed way, and lies when she gets caught.
[01:30:23.366 --> 01:30:26.388]  And so, they're trying to act like, oh, you know, the party split.
[01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:32.052]  And I was watching different Democrats on Fox News this morning saying, we all need to come together and be more centrist.
[01:30:32.092 --> 01:30:34.513]  No, the truth is, Republicans have tried to be centrist.
[01:30:34.533 --> 01:30:36.114]  We get drug along and their left is garbage.
[01:30:36.455 --> 01:30:39.417]  And the left now has just run away like a fish with a line.
[01:30:40.097 --> 01:30:41.999]  In the most extreme insanity.
[01:30:42.019 --> 01:30:45.201]  And so the media is spreading it like we all need to be less extreme.
[01:30:46.282 --> 01:30:48.644]  Conservatives and Christians and people, we're not extreme.
[01:30:48.904 --> 01:30:50.285]  We're promoting stuff that works.
[01:30:50.525 --> 01:30:51.466]  That's tried and true.
[01:30:51.646 --> 01:30:55.229]  Like family and property and the right to defense and borders.
[01:30:55.449 --> 01:31:03.875]  And then they're meanwhile saying there's hundreds of genders and pedophilia's good and world government's good and open borders are good and America sucks.
[01:31:03.996 --> 01:31:05.617]  And then we're like, okay, what's the alternative?
[01:31:05.777 --> 01:31:08.299]  It's just these people, I don't know how they got so whacked out.
[01:31:08.479 --> 01:31:15.684]  Well, I think, I've brought this up too, how the left is going insane, and I've had people say, well, everybody's a little bit more polarized, etc, etc.
[01:31:15.925 --> 01:31:17.105]  They've actually done studies.
[01:31:17.186 --> 01:31:28.774]  They track the trends of political opinions in the U.S., and they can prove with data that over the past few decades, the right-wing conservatives, Republican Party, they've remained pretty consistent, right?
[01:31:28.814 --> 01:31:35.399]  Someone who identifies as right-wing now is going to have a lot of common ground with someone who identified right-wing, let's say, 20, 30 years ago.
[01:31:37.941 --> 01:31:39.702]  This case is not the same for the left wing.
[01:31:39.722 --> 01:31:44.006]  They actually have demonstrably gone further left than they ever have been.
[01:31:44.026 --> 01:31:47.228]  I mean, we see this with even people like Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer.
[01:31:47.568 --> 01:31:54.173]  You know, there are tapes of Barack Obama of them, you know, maybe 10 years ago talking about the importance of securing the border.
[01:31:54.213 --> 01:31:56.655]  They're not saying that kind of stuff anymore.
[01:31:57.215 --> 01:32:04.521]  One of the only positive things I can say about AOC is I think she is so far left that even Nancy Pelosi and people like that are starting to say, okay,
[01:32:05.181 --> 01:32:08.623]  Maybe we need to slow things down a little bit.
[01:32:09.003 --> 01:32:23.711]  That's honestly the only hope I think the Democrats have right now because I think among a very small base of people, these far-left progressives, people like AOC are great, they're amazing, but I think the Democratic Party needs to realize that America in general is not woke Twitter.
[01:32:23.731 --> 01:32:26.973]  They need to stop pandering to these people or else they're gonna feel it in elections.
[01:32:33.479 --> 01:32:35.100]  You think our information's hardcore?
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.720]  You think our focus is brutal?

[01:32:58.447 --> 01:32:59.147]  Again, InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:33:06.403 --> 01:33:09.007]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:29.062 --> 01:33:37.431]  President Trump, I am here to respectfully tell you that if you don't wake the f**k up and take action right now, you're not going to get re-elected in 2020.
[01:33:38.492 --> 01:33:44.518]  In fact, the globalists are going to steal that election and then fully overthrow this nation as you know well.
[01:33:45.058 --> 01:33:50.403]  I'm about to give you a briefing on the endgame of censorship and the fact that you must act now!
[01:33:57.352 --> 01:34:00.614]  Mr. President, we're able to get this report to you.
[01:34:01.075 --> 01:34:14.564]  I beg you, for yourself, your family, my family, and the whole world, to understand that your blind spot, your Achilles heel, is your confidence that you can overpower the censors and overpower the manipulation that we saw in 2016.
[01:34:15.324 --> 01:34:20.128]  That was intense, but nothing compared to what the Democrats in the deep state are doing this time.
[01:34:20.348 --> 01:34:25.652]  They have pulled out all the stops in just the last three days, Mr. President.
[01:34:26.345 --> 01:34:26.805]  We're good
[01:34:42.094 --> 01:34:43.815]  Million followers apiece.
[01:34:43.955 --> 01:34:45.176]  Others had over 30 million.
[01:34:45.536 --> 01:34:55.941]  If you combine just the top two accounts that got deleted for no reason other than they were politically popular and shared your information, that's more followers than you have on Twitter.
[01:34:56.681 --> 01:34:57.702]  The Democrats admit
[01:34:58.382 --> 01:35:04.605]  The EU admits, the big tech giants admit that memes are more powerful than all cable news combined now.
[01:35:05.185 --> 01:35:07.426]  It's how America communicates.
[01:35:08.046 --> 01:35:13.229]  And the fact that you've let them do this to thousands of other prominent conservatives and nationalists
[01:35:13.877 --> 01:35:20.019]  And haven't taken action yet, other than criticizing it, has greenlit the purges to now be exponential.
[01:35:20.479 --> 01:35:29.483]  This is your distribution network that was getting your speeches and your statements and your administration's truth out to counter the establishment lies.
[01:35:30.342 --> 01:35:32.644]  And they're just being annihilated on a daily basis.
[01:35:33.264 --> 01:35:36.167]  Over 200 million in just the last three days.
[01:35:36.907 --> 01:35:37.348]  Look at this.
[01:35:37.648 --> 01:35:41.511]  SpicyMP4 had over 40 million followers.
[01:35:41.551 --> 01:35:49.797]  People that signed up over the years to follow the memes and posts, most of it your information, all gone, unable to communicate.
[01:35:50.118 --> 01:35:56.723]  Popular meme aggregator, you're dank, with over 30 million followers gone in just the last few days.
[01:35:56.883 --> 01:35:57.944]  Dozens of his accounts.
[01:35:58.524 --> 01:36:00.366]  And it goes on and on and on.
[01:36:00.626 --> 01:36:03.209]  Every few hours, new giant lists come out.
[01:36:03.329 --> 01:36:04.631]  We go click on them, they're dead.
[01:36:04.711 --> 01:36:05.151]  They're gone.
[01:36:05.231 --> 01:36:05.572]  Gone.
[01:36:05.852 --> 01:36:06.213]  Gone.
[01:36:06.493 --> 01:36:06.833]  Gone.
[01:36:06.993 --> 01:36:07.274]  Gone.
[01:36:07.314 --> 01:36:09.716]  Because nothing is being done by your administration.
[01:36:09.837 --> 01:36:11.498]  We've heard a bunch of talk about antitrust.
[01:36:11.518 --> 01:36:13.280]  We've heard a bunch of talk about injunctions.
[01:36:13.661 --> 01:36:15.082]  This is election meddling.
[01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:16.203]  Imagine!
[01:36:16.784 --> 01:36:29.858]  If hundreds and hundreds of millions of people following Democrat sites and Democrat news organizations were suddenly being deleted in a coordinated fashion, there would be an outcry the likes of which the world's never seen.
[01:36:30.359 --> 01:36:35.884]  Federal courts have ruled that people can attack you and lie about you on Twitter and have it posted to the very top.
[01:36:36.653 --> 01:36:40.694]  But they can then delete everybody completely and remove them forever.
[01:36:41.234 --> 01:36:50.237]  Your namesake, your son, Don Jr., has been one of the most prominent people accurately exposing what's happening and the peril to this country and your second term.
[01:36:50.817 --> 01:36:53.878]  You've got Tucker Carlson, you've got Matt Drudge doing a great job exposing it.
[01:36:54.219 --> 01:36:55.099]  But I know what's going on.
[01:36:55.899 --> 01:37:04.063]  The big fat cat politicos at Fox and other areas, they want the hundreds of millions of donation money to only go to their PACs, only go to their advertisements.
[01:37:04.543 --> 01:37:07.704]  Nobody's even advertising with meme makers in places like Infowars.
[01:37:07.925 --> 01:37:09.465]  We didn't get any money in the last election.
[01:37:09.725 --> 01:37:12.827]  We just wanted to see the country made great again, just like you do.
[01:37:13.487 --> 01:37:20.054]  Because the old, dying, political, neocon media system is jealous and envious of new media.
[01:37:20.374 --> 01:37:26.881]  They're working with the Democrats openly to suppress and shut down their competition at America and your expense.
[01:37:27.481 --> 01:37:33.347]  Trump, I'm sitting here watching these lillipullies eat you alive and carve you up like a giant ham.
[01:37:34.028 --> 01:37:38.251]  And dammit, I care about you, and my fate's tied to you, and I'm pissed, buddy!
[01:37:38.651 --> 01:37:42.733]  If you keep sitting there and taking this crap, I'm not going to put up with it anymore!
[01:37:42.753 --> 01:37:46.535]  Because it doesn't matter how good your agenda is, and how many other great things you do.
[01:37:47.056 --> 01:37:56.481]  If you sit there and let these out-of-control criminals walk in here and steal our First Amendment, and steal this damn election, then I don't know what I'm going to be forced to do.
[01:37:56.541 --> 01:37:57.242]  But let me tell you,
[01:37:58.291 --> 01:38:01.954]  Watching you let these bastards pull this off makes me sick.
[01:38:02.655 --> 01:38:08.020]  And so I'm begging my listeners and my viewers to light a fire under everybody in your administration's ass.
[01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:19.130]  To stand up for the First Amendment and to move out of the way of your second term after this whole Russiagate got proven as a fraud so we can try to restore this republic against the globalists who are trying to shut it down!
[01:38:19.551 --> 01:38:22.914]  President Trump, you've got 13.9 million followers on Instagram.
[01:38:23.922 --> 01:38:29.588]  Just two accounts on Instagram had over 70 million that promoted everything you're doing.
[01:38:29.808 --> 01:38:30.529]  Do you understand that?
[01:38:31.089 --> 01:38:33.652]  That's just two of the hundreds of millions gone the last few days.
[01:38:34.513 --> 01:38:36.235]  Hillary understood the power of the Internet.
[01:38:36.275 --> 01:38:43.042]  She tried to dominate social media, but nobody wanted to follow her, even though Facebook and Google and Twitter force-fed her.
[01:38:44.158 --> 01:38:48.481]  They underestimated you, they underestimated the people, but now they haven't underestimated it.
[01:38:48.861 --> 01:38:58.828]  They're pulling out all the stops for people to vote in the names of dead folks, and for electronic voting machine fraud, and for flooding the borders, and for all of this, but the big enchilada.
[01:38:59.588 --> 01:39:00.168]  It's the Internet.
[01:39:00.828 --> 01:39:07.411]  And I just sit here with horror, watching you be lied about, and myself being lied about, and watching the hell we go through trying to restore this republic.
[01:39:07.691 --> 01:39:13.173]  And you said we should never let another president, or another country, or this nation go through this again, and I agree with you.
[01:39:13.813 --> 01:39:16.774]  But we're going through something even worse right now.
[01:39:17.174 --> 01:39:22.816]  And Russiagate's been a distraction from Censorshipgate, an election meddling gate.
[01:39:23.496 --> 01:39:28.778]  In closing, I have some final words for the President, and some final words for viewers and listeners and other media people.
[01:39:29.548 --> 01:39:32.991]  As I said, other than Matt Drudge and Tucker Carlson and Don Jr.
[01:39:33.011 --> 01:39:36.133]  and a few others, everybody else thought it was cute when I got banned.
[01:39:36.914 --> 01:39:38.074]  And they'd say, oh, how is it?
[01:39:38.114 --> 01:39:38.675]  How you doing?
[01:39:38.695 --> 01:39:39.596]  We're so sad for you.
[01:39:39.816 --> 01:39:41.317]  And I'd say, oh, you're sad for me?
[01:39:42.257 --> 01:39:44.139]  They're coming for you next.
[01:39:44.739 --> 01:39:47.742]  And after they take all your speech, they're going to take all the rest of your freedom.
[01:39:47.762 --> 01:39:48.362]  That's how it works.
[01:39:48.882 --> 01:39:50.764]  And a year later, here we are.
[01:39:52.014 --> 01:39:56.696]  So it's very painful to watch folks at the big Trump event at the White House go, Oh, Alex was patient zero.
[01:39:56.916 --> 01:39:57.677]  We wish he was here.
[01:39:57.697 --> 01:40:01.678]  I don't give a rat's ass about being in the middle of the swamp at the White House.
[01:40:02.179 --> 01:40:04.360]  I care about freedom and defeating tyrants.
[01:40:04.660 --> 01:40:07.861]  And I warned you all how they were coming for everybody's freedoms.
[01:40:08.141 --> 01:40:09.102]  And now we're here.
[01:40:10.205 --> 01:40:18.194]  So we need to take action now and realize they first demonize somebody, ban them, make it all about them, and then everybody else follows.
[01:40:18.274 --> 01:40:20.056]  And that's what's been done.
[01:40:20.357 --> 01:40:21.157]  Trump's the target.
[01:40:21.438 --> 01:40:22.699]  The American people are the target.
[01:40:22.939 --> 01:40:23.840]  We're all the target.
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:28.946]  And we've got to stand together because if we don't have free speech and a First Amendment, what do we have?
[01:40:29.847 --> 01:40:33.249]  Big tech is the modern telecommunications system, like the telephone.
[01:40:33.929 --> 01:40:35.830]  And we all have a right to it.
[01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:39.892]  I'm going to end this special report with a little clip of Dr. Epstein.
[01:40:40.512 --> 01:40:43.274]  Full congressional testimony is on InfoWars.com.
[01:40:43.914 --> 01:40:45.735]  Congress is starting to figure out what's happening.
[01:40:46.415 --> 01:40:49.197]  But we don't have that long for this learning curve.
[01:40:49.217 --> 01:40:51.838]  We've got to have a crash course in awakening now.
[01:40:52.218 --> 01:40:55.680]  And that's why InfoWars.com stands strong as the tip of the spear.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.961]  And that's why the globalists want to shut down.
[01:40:58.241 --> 01:40:59.603]  Because we are the modern Paul Revere.
[01:40:59.843 --> 01:41:00.703]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:41:01.024 --> 01:41:02.605]  Here's a short clip of Dr. Epstein.
[01:41:02.945 --> 01:41:04.807]  Google's manipulation of votes.
[01:41:05.928 --> 01:41:11.852]  gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton in the year 2016.
[01:41:12.012 --> 01:41:13.994]  Is that correct?
[01:41:14.394 --> 01:41:17.576]  2.6 million is a rock-bottom minimum.
[01:41:18.236 --> 01:41:29.024]  The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes, depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that I've been studying.
[01:41:29.264 --> 01:41:33.747]  They control these and no one can counteract them.
[01:41:33.787 --> 01:41:35.448]  These are not competitive.
[01:41:36.248 --> 01:41:41.031]  These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.
[01:41:42.152 --> 01:41:51.758]  Your testimony is that Google is, through bias in search results, manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of.
[01:41:52.481 --> 01:42:08.671]  On a massive scale, in 2020, if all these companies are supporting the same candidate, there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.
[01:42:09.271 --> 01:42:13.734]  Without monitoring systems in place, we'll never know what these companies are doing.
[01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:14.214]  And in 2020?
[01:42:16.787 --> 01:42:26.651]  You can bet that all of these companies are going to go all out, and the methods that they're using are invisible.
[01:42:26.731 --> 01:42:27.931]  They're subliminal.
[01:42:28.271 --> 01:42:36.154]  They're more powerful than most any effects I've ever seen in the behavioral sciences, and I've been in the behavioral sciences for almost 40 years.
[01:42:36.694 --> 01:42:45.378]  A handful of Silicon Valley billionaires and giant corporations are able to spend millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, collectively.
[01:42:46.458 --> 01:42:50.983]  Massively influencing the results of elections.
[01:42:51.404 --> 01:42:53.586]  Senator, with respect, I must correct you.
[01:42:53.606 --> 01:42:53.966]  Please.
[01:42:54.307 --> 01:43:01.094]  If Mark Zuckerberg chooses to send out a go-vote reminder just to Democrats on Election Day, that doesn't cost him a dime.
[01:43:06.334 --> 01:43:07.535]  William in Florida.
[01:43:08.075 --> 01:43:09.015]  William, you're on the air.
[01:43:09.055 --> 01:43:09.436]  Go ahead.
[01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:10.256]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:43:10.316 --> 01:43:11.217]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:43:11.297 --> 01:43:11.957]  Thanks for calling.
[01:43:11.997 --> 01:43:14.678]  Before I get into my points, I want to plug a couple of products.
[01:43:14.738 --> 01:43:16.059]  First off, the Immune Wall.
[01:43:16.099 --> 01:43:17.200]  You don't mention it very much.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:18.480]  It helps keep me healthy.
[01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.623]  I work in an environment where I'm exposed to the public, and of course, you know, everything that comes along with that.
[01:43:26.945 --> 01:43:27.745]  Well thank you.
[01:43:27.825 --> 01:43:35.670]  For those that don't know, you've got things like emergency and you've got things like airport or whatever it's called that you know that people take and those things have some good things in them.
[01:43:35.770 --> 01:43:41.173]  When we did immune wall, I'm like what's three times stronger than any other immune support formula?
[01:43:41.193 --> 01:43:50.518]  They're like okay we can make this and so anything we make is just chocked full of the very best things and yes the super silver wound gel is a natural
[01:43:50.558 --> 01:43:57.044]  National brand, patented, FDA approved, used at hospitals, used over the counter, $40 a tube.
[01:43:57.224 --> 01:43:59.667]  We have to pay like $13 or something a tube.
[01:43:59.787 --> 01:44:01.628]  For folks who don't know, it's like gloves.
[01:44:01.769 --> 01:44:08.455]  Put a tiny bit on your hands, rub it, and then it's a preemptive wall of the strongest silver allowed by the FDA over the counter.
[01:44:08.615 --> 01:44:09.336]  Let me be very clear.
[01:44:09.616 --> 01:44:11.238]  Do not ingest it, okay?
[01:44:11.298 --> 01:44:12.660]  It's very toxic.
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:14.041]  But, I mean, it's weaponized.
[01:44:14.141 --> 01:44:15.643]  It's the strongest silver over-the-counter.
[01:44:15.743 --> 01:44:20.148]  But bacteria, viruses, it's approved and proven to kill them better than a hammer.
[01:44:20.469 --> 01:44:24.894]  Since you mentioned it, my friend, what experience have you had with a super silver wound gel?
[01:44:25.274 --> 01:44:33.758]  Everything from minor burns to actually take out a little sloppy in the kitchen one day, and I normally turn my, when I'm chopping stuff, I turn the knife away from me.
[01:44:33.878 --> 01:44:34.418]  I didn't do that.
[01:44:34.458 --> 01:44:38.560]  I was in a hurry, couldn't reach for the knife, and I cut my finger right down to the bone.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:48.905]  It was bleeding pretty good, and I put the super-silver wound gel on that and wrapped it, of course, and in less than four hours, the pain was gone, and in a day, the deepest part of the cut was already healing up.
[01:44:49.165 --> 01:44:58.717]  It is the best wound gel out there, and I've tried to haggle them down on the price, but after the patents and the FDA approval took them like nine years, this is the thing used in hospitals.
[01:44:58.757 --> 01:45:00.139]  So we're very, very proud of it.
[01:45:00.219 --> 01:45:01.301]  So thanks for the plug, William.
[01:45:08.817 --> 01:45:11.640]  Nicole in New Jersey wants to talk about GMOs and allergies.
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:13.202]  Awesome, thanks for taking my call.
[01:45:13.302 --> 01:45:19.208]  I love the doors and what you guys do there, so thank you and the rest of the crew for keeping us up to date with the truth and facts.
[01:45:19.328 --> 01:45:21.370]  Keeping your amygdalas not enlarged.
[01:45:23.867 --> 01:45:24.828]  We're trying, we're trying.
[01:45:24.928 --> 01:45:28.209]  So in New Jersey it's really terrible and I have really, really bad allergies.
[01:45:28.269 --> 01:45:32.330]  So what I want to tell Alex, thank you so much for getting the Alexis Pure Breeze.
[01:45:32.410 --> 01:45:37.052]  That has truly saved my life and has given me the ability to not have sinus infections anymore.
[01:45:37.132 --> 01:45:44.854]  So if anybody out there is listening and needs to breathe again and sleep right and not have multiple sinus infections, go for the Alexis Pure Breeze.
[01:45:44.954 --> 01:45:46.235]  Wow, so you keep it in your bedroom?
[01:45:46.795 --> 01:45:48.236]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, I do.
[01:45:48.396 --> 01:45:52.659]  And I have a couple that I'll be getting for my mom and dad, and then one for my son and his girlfriend.
[01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:55.020]  And New Jersey is just so air polluted, it's disgusting.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:04.286]  I actually live not far from Lockheed Martin, so there was a lot of lawsuits and stuff that went on when our neighborhood was built about the water and possible contaminants in the water.
[01:46:04.306 --> 01:46:09.770]  So it's actually a backwards way of how I found InfoWars, was looking on a natural way to kill my thyroid.
[01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:13.192]  And so the Selenium is actually what introduced me to InfoWars.
[01:46:13.212 --> 01:46:15.253]  I was like, where have you guys been my whole life, though?
[01:46:15.833 --> 01:46:17.354]  Yeah, it was definitely a bonus time.
[01:46:17.654 --> 01:46:18.975]  All right, Nicole, thanks for calling.
[01:46:18.995 --> 01:46:21.917]  We appreciate your support and everything else.
[01:46:22.217 --> 01:46:24.018]  And I might pick up one of those air cleaners.
[01:46:24.038 --> 01:46:25.479]  I have one at my desk, actually.
[01:46:25.599 --> 01:46:27.280]  So maybe I should get one for my house.
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.362]  Maybe that would help in my bedroom.
[01:46:33.283 --> 01:46:41.768]  A classic InfoWars fan favorite formula, Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a must have for any InfoWarrior serious about their oral health.
[01:46:41.868 --> 01:46:46.070]  Featuring natural oils and ingredients used since aboriginal and biblical times.
[01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:50.052]  Fueled by the good halogen iodine and high quality nano silver.
[01:46:50.272 --> 01:46:55.035]  We've taken the fluoride out and replaced it with powerful ingredients to help boost your smile.
[01:46:55.215 --> 01:46:57.236]  Don't miss out on one of our best products.
[01:46:57.396 --> 01:47:02.219]  Power up your morning routine with Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste at the InfoWars store.
[01:47:06.346 --> 01:47:08.933]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.861 --> 01:47:20.505]  Last segment, you saw the compelling evidence that we are in the middle of having 2020 elections stolen from us.
[01:47:21.166 --> 01:47:22.727]  This is the true fall of our country.
[01:47:23.567 --> 01:47:33.995]  Trump is just a desperate last gasp if we don't keep him in office and remove the globalists that have dug into our government and who created the whole Russiagate hoax and who've committed all these other crimes.
[01:47:34.615 --> 01:47:36.977]  When do they get in trouble for what they've done?
[01:47:37.337 --> 01:47:38.418]  That's the question I'm asking.
[01:47:39.139 --> 01:47:41.661]  But so often in the fight to keep this operation going,
[01:47:42.421 --> 01:47:56.152]  I forget to remind viewers and remind listeners that without you and word of mouth telling people about the show and how to find it, without you sharing the audio and the videos that we post to Infowars.com, the globalists are going to be able to carry out their plan to overthrow this country once and for all.
[01:47:56.632 --> 01:48:04.719]  So that's why it's important for you to please watch this short presentation at the end of the show today that breaks down things we can personally do for our bodies and support the broadcast at the same time.
[01:48:04.959 --> 01:48:07.161]  And I'll see you, Lord willing, back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:48:07.221 --> 01:48:09.563]  Central, with the Monday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:25.399 --> 01:48:29.564]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:48:31.846 --> 01:48:36.651]  The listeners of this syndicated radio and TV broadcast are the lifeblood of our operation.
[01:48:38.157 --> 01:48:52.148]  And I had a big realization a few months ago that I'm constantly talking about how critical it is that you buy our products for us to survive, instead of talking about why the products are so game-changing and so amazing.
[01:48:53.148 --> 01:48:56.771]  First thing I want to hit is the Iodine Conspiracy.
[01:48:57.592 --> 01:49:01.394]  The world is filled with bad halogens.
[01:49:01.735 --> 01:49:05.718]  Fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine, and many others.
[01:49:06.338 --> 01:49:18.960]  All of them are toxic to the body, but when the body doesn't have good, clean iodine, it will use the bad halogens in its place in all the glands and in the bone marrow and in the brain.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:26.482]  Here are several mainstream news articles that link to major studies out of PubMed and Harvard and others.
[01:49:27.242 --> 01:49:32.683]  How adding iodine to salt boosted America's IQs.
[01:49:33.603 --> 01:49:34.563]  Here's some of the other headlines.
[01:49:35.871 --> 01:49:41.738]  How adding iodine to salt resulted in a decade's worth of IQ gains for the United States.
[01:49:43.459 --> 01:49:50.142]  Again, they only mandated it for a few decades, but companies continued to do it right through the 1970s.
[01:49:50.342 --> 01:49:59.246]  So, let's go over some of these points here that are backed up in historical fact to understand why pure iodine is so important.
[01:49:59.687 --> 01:50:01.528]  The secret history of iodine.
[01:50:01.768 --> 01:50:04.949]  How iodine increased IQs by 15 points.
[01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:09.092]  And it goes through the shocking developments.
[01:50:09.473 --> 01:50:13.857]  The true history of iodine is something that most mainstream experts won't talk about.
[01:50:14.458 --> 01:50:27.030]  In the early 1920s, it was found that just adding iodine to salt supply produced a staggering 15-point IQ increase in iodine-deficient populations.
[01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:28.531]  That is so bombshell!
[01:50:29.312 --> 01:50:30.992]  So yes, ladies and gentlemen, it's a win-win.
[01:50:31.052 --> 01:50:42.175]  We fund our operation, not selling you opiates that kill millions a year, not selling you all these toxic drugs, not pushing Tylenol that eats your liver on you.
[01:50:42.515 --> 01:50:42.695]  No.
[01:50:43.316 --> 01:50:46.576]  We promote things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[01:50:47.997 --> 01:50:51.518]  X2 is the only true nascent iodine known on the market.
[01:50:52.718 --> 01:50:54.418]  It's procured between 7,000 and 12,000 feet deep in the earth.
[01:50:57.358 --> 01:50:58.960]  It is completely clean.
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:05.145]  Now, a very small percentage of the population cannot absorb pure atomic iodine.
[01:51:05.966 --> 01:51:15.515]  That's why we have Survival Shield X3 that has the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types, potassium iodine, a very clean form, and sodium iodine.
[01:51:16.156 --> 01:51:21.381]  I personally, eight years ago, was about 80 pounds overweight.
[01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:23.950]  And I was swimming up to a mile a day.
[01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:24.691]  I was jogging.
[01:51:25.272 --> 01:51:27.213]  My body just couldn't lose it.
[01:51:28.034 --> 01:51:33.999]  I went on the precursor of X2, working with research scientists that were telling me how important iodine was.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:35.721]  They wanted me to see for myself.
[01:51:36.201 --> 01:51:37.923]  And the weight began to pour off.
[01:51:38.243 --> 01:51:40.826]  I had sunspots on my skin, because I love the sun.
[01:51:41.226 --> 01:51:42.267]  They all went away.
[01:51:43.088 --> 01:51:45.370]  All this oil came out of my scalp, my body.
[01:51:45.730 --> 01:51:47.271]  I don't want to tell you what happened in the bathroom.
[01:51:47.872 --> 01:51:48.653]  And I was warned.
[01:51:50.461 --> 01:51:55.064]  About three weeks into this, most people have a detoxifying event, and it happened.
[01:51:55.525 --> 01:52:05.752]  So, do your own research, and then understand, we are bringing you, just like our information's hardcore and game-changing, the most powerful iodines out there, the purest, the cleanest.
[01:52:06.713 --> 01:52:08.674]  But do your own research into the iodine conspiracy.
[01:52:09.215 --> 01:52:14.959]  Now, that said, you're probably noticing that behind me while I've been talking, we've not been showing
[01:52:16.864 --> 01:52:18.305]  X2 or X3.
[01:52:19.246 --> 01:52:24.150]  And that's because this is the other big missing link and something I don't promote enough.
[01:52:25.051 --> 01:52:29.094]  Now, I was never a big supplement person until about seven, eight years ago.
[01:52:29.555 --> 01:52:34.799]  And when I saw how good clean iodine helped me, I began to research, well, what are the biggest game changers out there?
[01:52:35.279 --> 01:52:44.827]  And then I learned from top developers around the country, well, nobody will really put pharmaceutical grade things in their products other than the Japanese because
[01:52:45.948 --> 01:52:48.989]  Marketers want to put all their money into models.
[01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:54.291]  They want to put all their money into the high production value and million-dollar ads.
[01:52:54.351 --> 01:52:56.271]  They don't want to put it into the product.
[01:52:56.291 --> 01:53:02.493]  And I later discovered that most companies, the bottle costs more than what's in them.
[01:53:03.474 --> 01:53:07.575]  That's not the case with other critical game changers like DNA Force Plus.
[01:53:09.249 --> 01:53:14.314]  This product has 30-plus dollars of product in it.
[01:53:15.075 --> 01:53:21.422]  And that's only because I signed a two-year contract for millions and millions of dollars to get the price cut in almost half.
[01:53:22.122 --> 01:53:25.486]  So that's how we're able to call it DNA Plus and lower the price.
[01:53:26.146 --> 01:53:26.967]  Its retail used to be $150.
[01:53:27.007 --> 01:53:27.988]  We'd sell it for about $100 on sale.
[01:53:30.871 --> 01:53:35.794]  Now I can sell it on sale for way less than that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:36.315 --> 01:53:38.917]  And again, it takes two to three weeks to kick in.
[01:53:39.577 --> 01:53:53.667]  You've got to do your own research into everything that is in this, because there are synthetic forms of PQQ, and CoQ10, and Reservitol, and ELEV ATP, and all the other things that are in it.
[01:53:54.434 --> 01:54:03.958]  But with this product, you get large dosages of the most studied, proven, patented, certified ingredients.
[01:54:04.298 --> 01:54:07.519]  And that's why DNA Force Plus is such a game changer.
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:11.141]  It's been proven to be able to regrow nerves.
[01:54:11.901 --> 01:54:16.183]  It's been proven to make telomeres last longer, essentially making them grow.
[01:54:16.923 --> 01:54:18.084]  It's half empty, half full.
[01:54:18.424 --> 01:54:19.424]  They don't shrink as fast.
[01:54:20.045 --> 01:54:22.926]  It's been proven to clean out your mitochondrial DNA.
[01:54:23.726 --> 01:54:27.313]  And I was sitting there about a month ago realizing, when's the last time I took it?
[01:54:27.353 --> 01:54:28.095]  When's the last time I took my X2?
[01:54:28.115 --> 01:54:32.964]  Because I go through these cycles where I'll try it, I'll take it, I'll lose weight, I'll feel great, and then I'll forget!
[01:54:34.366 --> 01:54:37.668]  You've got to continually take it to have the real benefits.
[01:54:38.228 --> 01:54:43.911]  And again, any of these products take time to hit, time to kick in.
[01:54:43.972 --> 01:54:46.833]  They're not drugs, some twisted thing made by scientists.
[01:54:47.554 --> 01:54:49.014]  They're mother nature.
[01:54:49.835 --> 01:54:55.918]  That's what Big Pharma is trying to copy and trying to basically rip off, but with all the side effects.
[01:54:56.399 --> 01:54:58.540]  These don't have that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:00.137 --> 01:55:07.560]  So let's look at some of these factoids, or bragging rights, as they are here on the piece of paper, about DNA Force Plus.
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:12.482]  Because even myself, I'm asking myself, why aren't I taking this every day?
[01:55:13.242 --> 01:55:14.763]  Why isn't my wife taking it every day?
[01:55:14.803 --> 01:55:16.324]  We've been given such great gifts by God.
[01:55:17.608 --> 01:55:18.408]  Through Mother Nature.
[01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:20.229]  Why wouldn't we take advantage of it?
[01:55:20.269 --> 01:55:21.670]  So, DNA Force.
[01:55:21.690 --> 01:55:22.731]  Here are some of the factoids.
[01:55:23.131 --> 01:55:24.572]  Here are some of the bragging points.
[01:55:24.972 --> 01:55:34.537]  DNA Force Plus was specifically formulated to contain all the best ingredients on the market that positively impact your telomeres and your mitochondria.
[01:55:35.197 --> 01:55:40.442]  L-O-V-A-T-P, an award-winning, clinically-studied ingredient.
[01:55:41.183 --> 01:55:50.251]  2018 Ingredient of the Year, awarded by the Nutritional Ingredients Awards Conference, increases cellular energy levels and improves athletic performance.
[01:55:51.212 --> 01:55:52.993]  That's the product of 2018.
[01:55:53.033 --> 01:55:57.438]  Now let's look at my personal favorite, PQQ.
[01:55:58.971 --> 01:56:03.775]  This ingredient has won multiple awards, including Ingredient with the Best Science.
[01:56:04.135 --> 01:56:14.023]  There are over 1,000 published scientific studies on PQQ's health benefits, and you owe it to yourself to research it and then discover we have, again, the best PQQ on the market.
[01:56:14.544 --> 01:56:16.986]  In fact, here's more on PQQ and CoQ10.
[01:56:17.486 --> 01:56:21.770]  PQQ and coenzyme Q10 are naturally found in the human body.
[01:56:23.433 --> 01:56:30.176]  Only discovered 50 years ago, researchers are now only recently discovering the potential benefits of these essential bio-nutrients.
[01:56:30.677 --> 01:56:36.719]  These exciting new discoveries include, and listen to this, increase the formation of new nerve cells.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:37.860]  That's right.
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:42.602]  Promoting growth of new mitochondria, which promotes healthy longevity.
[01:56:43.383 --> 01:56:47.785]  Promoting nerve stem and progenitor cells from the oxidative damage.
[01:56:48.789 --> 01:56:55.834]  Listen, folks, Merck and the rest of Big Pharma are circling like sharks on Coenzyme CoQ10 and the rest of these.
[01:56:55.854 --> 01:56:58.336]  I mean, look at this report from them right there and their own findings.
[01:56:59.016 --> 01:57:02.119]  You've got to discover the power of Mother Nature.
[01:57:02.579 --> 01:57:14.948]  Despite the fact that DNA Force Plus is our number three bestseller and our most profitable product, I am still offering it at a price to those of you that haven't tried it, an introductory price of 50% off.
[01:57:16.889 --> 01:57:21.973]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're only making 25% on this, but I want you to see how amazing it is.
[01:57:21.993 --> 01:57:23.654]  I want you to experience it.
[01:57:24.054 --> 01:57:25.595]  Get your DNA Force today.
[01:57:26.096 --> 01:57:31.579]  Part of this sale that's only going for two weeks for 50% off at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.541]  Oh, and I forgot from the earlier breakdown.
[01:57:35.342 --> 01:57:37.043]  Google's manipulation of votes
[01:57:56.287 --> 01:58:02.211]  gave at least 2.6 million additional votes to Hillary Clinton in the year 2016.
[01:58:02.351 --> 01:58:04.032]  Is that correct?
[01:58:04.353 --> 01:58:07.915]  2.6 million is a rock-bottom minimum.
[01:58:08.595 --> 01:58:19.383]  The range is between 2.6 and 10.4 million votes, depending on how aggressive they were in using the techniques that I've been studying.
[01:58:19.623 --> 01:58:24.106]  They control these, and no one can counteract them.
[01:58:24.126 --> 01:58:25.807]  These are not competitive.
[01:58:26.608 --> 01:58:31.392]  These are tools that they have at their disposal exclusively.
[01:58:32.493 --> 01:58:42.123]  Your testimony is that Google is, through bias in search results, manipulating voters in a way they're not aware of.
[01:58:42.839 --> 01:58:58.999]  On a massive scale, in 2020, if all these companies are supporting the same candidate, there are 15 million votes on the line that can be shifted without people's knowledge and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.
