[00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:05.958]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:00:05.958 --> 00:00:11.072]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:17.743 --> 00:00:29.871]  You had Strzok and Page who were in charge of launching this investigation and they were saying things like, we must stop this president, we need an insurance policy against this president.
[00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:38.756]  That, in my view, when you have people that are in the highest echelons of the law enforcement of this nation saying things like that, that sounds an awful lot like a coup.
[00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:40.357]  And it could well be treason.
[00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:41.859]  And I think that we need to know more.
[00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.161]  We need to know what was Jim Comey's role in all of this.
[00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:45.643]  These people reported to him.
[00:00:45.643 --> 00:00:47.384]  Andy McCabe reported to him.
[00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:48.746]  What was Comey's role in that?
[00:00:48.746 --> 00:00:52.890]  And that is what the Attorney General is going to be focused on.
[00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.834]  Sir, the Constitution says treason is punishable by death.
[00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:59.176]  You've accused your adversaries of treason.
[00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:01.859]  Who specifically are you accusing of treason?
[00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:10.045]  Well, I think a number of people, and I think what you look is that they have unsuccessfully tried to take down the wrong person.
[00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:24.415]  If you look at Comey, if you look at McCabe, if you look at probably people higher than that, if you look at Strzok, they want an insurance policy so that should she for any reason lose, remember, $100 million to one,
[00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:27.918]  Maybe he said 100 million to nothing.
[00:01:27.918 --> 00:01:33.641]  But should she lose, we'll have an insurance policy and we'll get this guy out of office.
[00:01:33.641 --> 00:01:36.583]  That's what they said and that's what they meant.
[00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:37.643]  That's treason.
[00:01:37.643 --> 00:01:38.244]  That's treason.
[00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:55.465]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Monday, 27th, 2019 broadcast.
[00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:58.127]  We were going to run a rebroadcast today.
[00:01:58.127 --> 00:02:00.549]  Owen Schroyer was going to host tomorrow.
[00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.874]  I was going to go on vacation with my family for just four or five days, but I canceled that on
[00:02:09.474 --> 00:02:17.813]  Friday morning and let the crew know that I was coming back in because so many incredibly historic things are happening.
[00:02:19.247 --> 00:02:26.712]  As I told you months ago, Trump is going to move with treason charges against the deep state.
[00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.893]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:41.641]  We're not in that place where Republican and Democratic parties basically share power with each other and engage in massive corruption and destroy the nation.
[00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:43.663]  Trump is really trying to be the president.
[00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.664]  He's really trying to restore the republic.
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:57.623]  And that's why you see the insane response that is unfolding on every single front.
[00:02:57.623 --> 00:02:59.944]  That's why you see the media out of control.
[00:02:59.944 --> 00:03:04.685]  It's why you see the Chi-Coms running ads and spending money trying to remove Trump from office.
[00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:10.747]  It's why you see the EU attacking because what's happening with Trump in America is a lot bigger than the United States, obviously.
[00:03:12.315 --> 00:03:13.215]  Here are the headlines.
[00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:14.316]  European elections.
[00:03:14.316 --> 00:03:20.098]  Italy stunned as Salvini wins majority and says a new Europe is born.
[00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:31.883]  Remember, parliaments run where it takes usually three elections to remove a party that's dominant because they are in a parliamentary system with dozens of parties.
[00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:34.364]  And the elections are staggered.
[00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:40.587]  This is the last two elections have swept the nationalists, patriots, anti-globalist members of their Senate.
[00:03:41.485 --> 00:03:50.428]  And members of their parliament have literally broken into Bohemian Grove-type events, broken into Bilderberg events, and been beaten up.
[00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:52.509]  That was six years ago.
[00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.930]  Now they are the dominant party.
[00:03:56.952 --> 00:04:01.396]  Merkel coalition in crisis talks after EU vote debacle.
[00:04:01.396 --> 00:04:03.698]  She's been holding on through seven elections.
[00:04:03.698 --> 00:04:07.841]  She's lost, but she's bought off the other parties and stayed in power.
[00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:09.803]  She's going to be gone very soon.
[00:04:09.803 --> 00:04:14.326]  Nigel Farage could suddenly be the new Prime Minister of England, they're saying.
[00:04:14.326 --> 00:04:15.287]  Wow!
[00:04:15.287 --> 00:04:19.911]  All the demonization he's been under got his first start on this broadcast.
[00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:23.534]  He said on air, InfoWars push UKIP over the top.
[00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:28.399]  Now he heads up the new Brexit party that is the fastest growing party in Europe.
[00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:35.547]  Le Pen demands Macron dissolve Parliament after Globalist is dealt humiliating defeat.
[00:04:35.547 --> 00:04:38.491]  It just continues and continues.
[00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:46.478]  But the globalists are striking back with massive censorship and the EU is threatening to invade countries that try to pull out with an EU army.
[00:04:46.478 --> 00:04:49.380]  We're right back to where World War II started again.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.461]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:52.343]  Owen Schroeder is also in studio.
[00:04:52.343 --> 00:04:54.945]  Paul Joseph Watson will report from England in T-minus 25 minutes.
[00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:55.406]  Stay with us!
[00:05:00.179 --> 00:05:02.060]  They've not shut down our speech!
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.563]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:11.305]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of a sudden, we used to love you on air.
[00:05:11.305 --> 00:05:15.067]  It was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:16.388]  Are you coming back?
[00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:17.529]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.410]  We're at newswars.com.
[00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.752]  Paul Watson's launched his own summit, dot news.
[00:05:21.752 --> 00:05:23.753]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[00:05:23.753 --> 00:05:28.516]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:30.758]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:05:30.758 --> 00:05:32.319]  InfoWars!
[00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.040]  Don't tell me!
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.380]  Woo!
[00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:40.173]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.694]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:05:41.694 --> 00:05:44.436]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:05:44.436 --> 00:05:46.657]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:05:46.657 --> 00:05:50.159]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:52.901]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:54.983]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:05:54.983 --> 00:05:56.183]  That's where they find it.
[00:05:56.183 --> 00:05:57.984]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:05:57.984 --> 00:05:58.565]  They just go there.
[00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:26.755]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.755 --> 00:06:38.542]  Alright, our devastating victories against the globalists here and abroad are so incredible, so historic, that words can hardly describe the victories we're having.
[00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:41.016]  Now, here's the problem.
[00:06:41.016 --> 00:06:43.099]  As Newtonian physics document...
[00:06:44.306 --> 00:06:50.069]  Via Sir Isaac Newton, for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.
[00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:55.591]  How have I been able for 20 years to predict everything you have now seen unfold?
[00:06:55.591 --> 00:06:59.433]  It's called studying history and studying the arrogance of the establishment.
[00:06:59.433 --> 00:07:02.234]  But there is a dark side to this.
[00:07:02.234 --> 00:07:04.415]  There's an upside-down world to it.
[00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:07.776]  We'll be talking about the enemy striking back.
[00:07:07.776 --> 00:07:11.898]  But first, treason is a serious word.
[00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.533]  I think everybody knows, and I broke some major news here.
[00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:22.636]  And it isn't news that hadn't already been telegraphed by the President and others, but I confirmed it.
[00:07:22.636 --> 00:07:29.061]  And now it's in the news the last four days, and the establishment is crapping a brick factory.
[00:07:29.061 --> 00:07:31.883]  Every time I talk about Trump moving against the deep state,
[00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:52.514]  I think what is really crucially important to remember here is that you had Strzok and Page who were in charge of launching this investigation and they were saying things like, we must stop this president.
[00:07:52.654 --> 00:07:52.974]  The Deep State!
[00:08:16.138 --> 00:08:22.123]  The National Security System that is controlled by the Deep State to a great extent has been trying to block Trump's reforms.
[00:08:22.123 --> 00:08:25.567]  They've listened to my phone calls with Trump.
[00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.850]  And they've also listened to the phone calls of other people with Trump.
[00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.815]  And that's why they're particularly pissed, because Trump goes and researches what I say and acts on it.
[00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:35.616]  And they've admitted that.
[00:08:36.633 --> 00:08:46.377]  This isn't about tootin' my horn, but it's why you have to realize that they went so far as to say, you're not just banned on Facebook, your name is banned, buddy.
[00:08:46.377 --> 00:08:58.262]  And they are in Atlantic Monthly on the Washington Post and New York Times just last week calling me an apex predator, saying I've got to be basically arrested now.
[00:08:58.262 --> 00:09:01.003]  Now, I didn't launch any wars and kill any people.
[00:09:01.003 --> 00:09:03.144]  I don't have a criminal record.
[00:09:03.144 --> 00:09:05.445]  But why am I the one who must not be named?
[00:09:06.578 --> 00:09:08.458]  Because I actually do my homework.
[00:09:08.458 --> 00:09:12.159]  Anyone that knows this information does not say this on air.
[00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:21.362]  Because they will be audited, they will be harassed, they will be threatened, they might be physically attacked.
[00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:24.202]  Antifa will come to their house.
[00:09:24.202 --> 00:09:33.364]  So when I went to D.C., I met with three people in media, in U.S.
[00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:35.185]  intelligence, and in government.
[00:09:35.913 --> 00:09:41.897]  Who had all met with the president two days before I got there.
[00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:55.107]  And these are guys in suits in high-rise buildings in DC, some of which are household names, with sweat in air-conditioned rooms, and I don't know why, I was sweating too, running down their heads.
[00:09:55.107 --> 00:09:57.148]  And they said, no, he's making the move.
[00:09:57.148 --> 00:09:58.489]  We were just in a meeting with him two days ago.
[00:09:58.489 --> 00:09:59.790]  You're right, it's going down.
[00:10:02.386 --> 00:10:03.707]  They've got total proof.
[00:10:03.707 --> 00:10:07.149]  They're working with other governments, other agencies, other corporations.
[00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:08.270]  It's much worse than you know.
[00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.653]  They actually even had a plan to assassinate the president.
[00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:17.157]  So now it's gone into Red Sirenville, okay?
[00:10:17.157 --> 00:10:18.097]  This is not a drill.
[00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:20.299]  This is not a game.
[00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:21.760]  And they said Trump is going to move.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.002]  He's going to declassify everything within a month.
[00:10:25.002 --> 00:10:26.703]  And all hell's going to break loose.
[00:10:26.703 --> 00:10:28.605]  So you better dig in and get your audience ready.
[00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:35.673]  As you know, I declassified, I guess, potentially millions of pages of documents.
[00:10:35.673 --> 00:10:37.274]  I don't know what it is.
[00:10:37.274 --> 00:10:38.695]  I have no idea.
[00:10:38.695 --> 00:10:40.336]  But I want to be transparent.
[00:10:40.336 --> 00:10:42.538]  Everybody wanted me to declassify.
[00:10:42.538 --> 00:10:43.838]  I've done it.
[00:10:43.838 --> 00:10:46.460]  And you could almost say he's the trustee.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.182]  He's a highly respected man.
[00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:51.603]  Our Attorney General is in charge.
[00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:52.624]  Let's see what he finds.
[00:10:54.965 --> 00:11:01.729]  We have documents now that I have declassified for the purpose of the Attorney General.
[00:11:01.729 --> 00:11:06.011]  He can then show them to the public, do whatever he wants to do with them.
[00:11:06.011 --> 00:11:13.474]  But you have to get down to what happened, because what happened is a tremendous blight on our country.
[00:11:13.474 --> 00:11:19.677]  What happened, the investigation, they tried to do a takedown, and you can't do that.
[00:11:19.677 --> 00:11:22.839]  And let me just tell you, this should never, ever happen.
[00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:25.420]  To another president again.
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:33.022]  What he's been saying, there's been an attempted coup, it's got to be dealt with, but then it's basically treason and we've got to bring the people to justice that did it.
[00:11:33.022 --> 00:11:40.664]  Trump then signed an executive memorandum ordering all 17 US intelligence agencies
[00:11:42.366 --> 00:11:53.553]  To prepare for him in the next seven days, and of course they're gonna try to block it, but he's given the order, all declassification of all the Russia investigation, everything.
[00:11:53.553 --> 00:12:00.537]  That is pulling the trigger on the shot heard around the world.
[00:12:00.537 --> 00:12:01.497]  May 27th, 2019, we're live.
[00:12:01.497 --> 00:12:08.722]  Because during emergency situations for the Republic and the planet, we'll be live.
[00:12:09.983 --> 00:12:11.684]  Big news is unfolding.
[00:12:11.684 --> 00:12:15.366]  We'll be live on holidays.
[00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:19.049]  Deadly or explosive or war news or economic news breaks.
[00:12:19.049 --> 00:12:19.649]  It's critical.
[00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:21.310]  I'll be on it at midnight.
[00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.492]  Tune in to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.983]  The globalists have been fighting to take us off air ahead of big events they've got planned.
[00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:37.929]  But now Trump and people in the establishment will understand that the rest of the establishment is insane, like Hitler, are making their move on the globalists.
[00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:51.738]  And you're seeing globalists being removed in South America, in Central America, in Africa, in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East, in Central Asia, in Southeast Asia, in Japan.
[00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:56.133]  Everywhere.
[00:12:56.133 --> 00:12:58.234]  Humanity's making its move.
[00:12:58.234 --> 00:13:02.337]  Total victory, ladies and gentlemen, in my view.
[00:13:02.337 --> 00:13:08.941]  The media tries to spin the Green Party getting some gains, because the left's getting more hardcore left, the right's getting more hardcore right.
[00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:12.803]  But massive gains, the most gains in Europe and the UK by
[00:13:14.412 --> 00:13:15.994]  Nationalist populist parties.
[00:13:15.994 --> 00:13:20.518]  We're going to be getting into all of it today, but the president talking about the treason word.
[00:13:20.518 --> 00:13:22.220]  We told you it was coming.
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.122]  This is not business as usual.
[00:13:24.122 --> 00:13:28.586]  You see the establishment going after Trump, going after the press, going after us.
[00:13:28.586 --> 00:13:31.830]  For the last 40 years or so, you've had the Republicans and Democrats share power.
[00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:34.646]  That's a scrutish.
[00:13:34.646 --> 00:13:36.867]  There's a real fight to change that and stop that.
[00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:40.287]  I cannot stress enough what a historic time this is.
[00:13:40.287 --> 00:13:45.088]  Let's play a clip of the President, again, right before he took off to Japan, using the treason word.
[00:13:45.088 --> 00:13:46.429]  Here it is.
[00:13:46.429 --> 00:13:50.370]  Sir, the Constitution says treason is punishable by death.
[00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.710]  You've accused your adversaries of treason.
[00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.631]  Who specifically are you accusing of treason?
[00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:57.151]  Well, I think a number of people.
[00:13:57.151 --> 00:14:01.812]  And I think what you look is that they have unsuccessfully tried to take down
[00:14:02.532 --> 00:14:03.592]  The wrong person.
[00:14:03.592 --> 00:14:16.195]  If you look at Comey, if you look at McCabe, if you look at probably people higher than that, if you look at Strzok, they want an insurance policy so that should she, for any reason, lose, remember?
[00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:18.855]  100 million to one.
[00:14:18.855 --> 00:14:21.456]  Maybe he said 100 million to nothing.
[00:14:21.456 --> 00:14:26.517]  But should she lose, we'll have an insurance policy and we'll get this guy out of office.
[00:14:26.517 --> 00:14:30.138]  And that's what they said and that's what they meant.
[00:14:30.138 --> 00:14:30.738]  That's treason.
[00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:35.040]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is treason.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.982]  Owen Schroyer is riding shotgun with me today.
[00:14:36.982 --> 00:14:40.524]  He'll be hosting the regular Alex Jones Show tomorrow.
[00:14:40.524 --> 00:14:45.687]  I'll be popping in as well, but we had to come in on Memorial Day because such history is unfolding.
[00:14:45.687 --> 00:14:50.690]  One minute to break, but how would you crystallize, Owen, as you ride shotgun today, where we are?
[00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:56.414]  I'm really having trouble finding words that properly lay out just how serious the situation is.
[00:14:57.281 --> 00:14:59.102]  Well, I'd crystallize it with a question, Alex.
[00:14:59.102 --> 00:15:02.685]  I mean, we've got a group of individuals that have committed open treason.
[00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:03.846]  This is not a debate.
[00:15:03.846 --> 00:15:08.729]  Now, are these people committing open treason because they simply don't like one man getting elected for president?
[00:15:08.729 --> 00:15:12.272]  Because they simply don't like a country's decision of who they should elect?
[00:15:12.272 --> 00:15:14.573]  Or is there something even bigger at stake here, Alex?
[00:15:14.573 --> 00:15:17.035]  Now, that's what I would put my money on.
[00:15:17.035 --> 00:15:19.096]  Now, you heard Trump say it even goes higher up.
[00:15:19.096 --> 00:15:19.877]  We know who he's talking about.
[00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:21.258]  He's talking about Obama.
[00:15:21.258 --> 00:15:22.479]  He's talking about Brennan.
[00:15:22.479 --> 00:15:23.540]  He's talking about Clapper.
[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.721]  Now, they're blaming one another right now.
[00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:26.662]  Who started the Russia thing?
[00:15:27.202 --> 00:15:31.765]  The real question Americans are going to have to ask, I think, in the next coming weeks, why?
[00:15:31.765 --> 00:15:33.766]  Why would they be committing open treason?
[00:15:33.766 --> 00:15:34.407]  Why?
[00:15:34.407 --> 00:15:37.429]  What is so bad about America deciding its own fate?
[00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:42.132]  What is so bad about Donald Trump that they had to commit open treason to keep him out of office?
[00:15:42.132 --> 00:15:42.592]  That's right.
[00:15:42.592 --> 00:15:48.216]  And I don't know if the country's going to be ready to see how bad it really was, Alex, but Trump might not fully show him.
[00:15:48.216 --> 00:15:49.657]  So that's what we're going to find out.
[00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:50.918]  We'll have exactly.
[00:15:50.918 --> 00:15:52.099]  And how will they strike back?
[00:15:52.099 --> 00:15:52.719]  You just said it.
[00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:53.760]  What are they hiding?
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.760]  And how will they strike back?
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.741]  And how will we fight back?
[00:15:55.741 --> 00:15:56.442]  Stay with us.
[00:15:56.442 --> 00:15:56.842]  We're live.
[00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:03.186]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[00:16:03.186 --> 00:16:08.170]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:05.073]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:05.073 --> 00:17:08.114]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.114 --> 00:17:14.057]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.057 --> 00:17:17.838]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:17.838 --> 00:17:18.759]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:20.040]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:26.645]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:28.067]  Available at Amazon Books.

[00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.429]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:47.286]  Alex Jones here back live, Owen Schroer riding shotgun, Paul Joseph Watson on the devastation that nationalists, the patriots, the anti-globalists, that Alex Jones type individuals have just carried out in Europe.
[00:20:47.286 --> 00:20:49.487]  And I don't say that to brag.
[00:20:49.487 --> 00:20:57.150]  I'm going to say something very slowly and very clearly so that it sinks in for me and it sinks in for all of you out there.
[00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.771]  I don't take myself that seriously in poll wars.
[00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:02.477]  I mean, I know we tell the truth.
[00:21:02.477 --> 00:21:11.439]  I do take the truth seriously, but I don't put myself on a pedestal or think of how powerful we are, because we're humble individuals.
[00:21:11.439 --> 00:21:15.441]  I respect the power of the people, but I want to explain something.
[00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:25.704]  The New York Times, the Washington Post, the leftist arms of the CIA, federal judges, the EU, the UN, the Financial Times of London,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.004]  They know that Infowars rebooted nationalism worldwide.
[00:21:34.004 --> 00:21:54.217]  Nigel Farage, last time he was on, and the time before that, and when I had dinner with him at the RNC three years ago, said half of the support for UKIP in its early days was Infowars, when they had no media, and that that's how they got half their votes and how their party was able to grow.
[00:21:56.321 --> 00:22:04.749]  No one was running a multimedia operation covering globalism and the alternative New Renaissance nationalism.
[00:22:04.749 --> 00:22:06.490]  Free market.
[00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.852]  Common sense systems.
[00:22:07.852 --> 00:22:10.774]  We did it!
[00:22:10.774 --> 00:22:13.076]  And we told you first about the illegal spying.
[00:22:13.076 --> 00:22:15.318]  And we told you first about the globalist plan.
[00:22:15.318 --> 00:22:16.820]  And I know you know about it as well.
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:18.842]  A lot of Americans know about it.
[00:22:18.842 --> 00:22:20.283]  We were just the focal point.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:28.165]  So it wasn't just a few people at gun shows with their tables, you know, selling G. Edward Griffin books, which are the best people ever!
[00:22:28.165 --> 00:22:30.347]  We stand on their shoulders!
[00:22:30.347 --> 00:22:34.050]  People like Gary Allen, and none dare call it conspiracy!
[00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:42.056]  But the reason I point out the importance of InfoWars is the globalists know that we're ground zero.
[00:22:42.056 --> 00:22:43.677]  They know we're patient zero.
[00:22:43.677 --> 00:22:45.599]  They know we're domino number one, baby.
[00:22:47.782 --> 00:22:52.506]  And you've got them losing on every front, and they've committed so many crimes.
[00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:55.848]  We'll talk about that next segment with what Owen brought up.
[00:22:55.848 --> 00:23:04.454]  They've engaged in so much criminal activity, so much eugenics, secret testing, suppressed technology that Trump's saying he's going to start releasing, which he's begun.
[00:23:04.454 --> 00:23:08.818]  And that's why they're so frantic to ignore his orders and not do what he says.
[00:23:08.818 --> 00:23:11.580]  But as they lose ground in every other country,
[00:23:12.864 --> 00:23:18.734]  And as every election brings us closer to patriot nationalist dominance globally, they're done.
[00:23:19.838 --> 00:23:25.022]  Unless they can start some big wars, release some bioweapons, or pull some other big shenanigans.
[00:23:25.022 --> 00:23:31.166]  And believe me, they didn't get in power by being tame, or being shrinking violets, or not being bold.
[00:23:31.166 --> 00:23:33.067]  Fortune favors the bold.
[00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:36.549]  Their fortune is power and control over human destiny.
[00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:42.113]  Our fortune is a future for our children, together in God's plan to the stars and beyond.
[00:23:42.113 --> 00:23:43.754]  A pro-human future.
[00:23:43.754 --> 00:23:45.235]  So I'm going to say this now.
[00:23:45.235 --> 00:23:49.518]  I rarely, and early in the show, really explain to listeners, this isn't a game.
[00:23:50.739 --> 00:23:53.860]  And I've asked for your help over the years, and if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.301]  And we have withstood the storm together.
[00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:58.623]  But we are finally going to launch more shows.
[00:23:58.623 --> 00:24:10.008]  We are hiring more reporters with just the belief and the faith that the money will come in to expand in the face of the globalists, because they want us shut down ahead of 2020, and that's only six months away.
[00:24:10.008 --> 00:24:10.829]  Can you believe it?
[00:24:11.673 --> 00:24:16.835]  The year 2020 is only six and a half months away, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:16.835 --> 00:24:19.356]  We are in the eye of the storm right now.
[00:24:19.356 --> 00:24:24.278]  When we come out of the eye, it is going to be 200 mile an hour winds for everybody.
[00:24:24.278 --> 00:24:26.819]  CNN's collapsing, shutting down.
[00:24:26.819 --> 00:24:29.160]  All the other leftist publications, Huffington Post.
[00:24:30.481 --> 00:24:33.782]  You name it, they're all circling the toilet bowl.
[00:24:33.782 --> 00:24:35.042]  They all lose money.
[00:24:35.042 --> 00:24:39.603]  Vice has lost five billion dollars for Disney.
[00:24:39.603 --> 00:24:47.005]  Five billion dollars shoveling videos of how the dictator of China is good and Trump is bad.
[00:24:47.005 --> 00:24:53.726]  Shoveling videos how I'm evil and Trump's evil and how Christians suck and how Jesus sucks.
[00:24:53.726 --> 00:24:54.786]  They're rejected.
[00:24:54.786 --> 00:24:56.747]  Billions into Vice.
[00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.854]  And they can't even stand up to InfoWars.
[00:25:00.854 --> 00:25:07.883]  They don't have the footprint or the result because people know lies when they see it.
[00:25:07.883 --> 00:25:12.048]  We don't have five billion dollars in the last five years we spent.
[00:25:14.682 --> 00:25:18.946]  Over $150 million the last five years to run this place.
[00:25:18.946 --> 00:25:26.112]  That's how much the bandwidth, and the insurance, and the crew, and the legal, and the systems, and the taxes, and the regulations in media.
[00:25:26.112 --> 00:25:29.935]  Little bitty radio stations cost millions to run a year.
[00:25:29.935 --> 00:25:32.497]  Newspapers in middle-sized towns cost millions.
[00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:35.240]  Newspapers in big towns cost $100 million to run.
[00:25:36.474 --> 00:25:41.179]  It costs $450 million a year to run BuzzFeed.
[00:25:41.179 --> 00:25:46.083]  And they've got to get over $100 million from Soros, and they still lose money.
[00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:47.885]  We don't get anything from Soros.
[00:25:47.885 --> 00:25:49.407]  We don't get anything from anybody but you.
[00:25:50.305 --> 00:25:59.787]  And we need $40 million a year to run this place and defeat the globalists and pay for the bandwidth and pay for the audio and pay for the crew and do it.
[00:25:59.787 --> 00:26:01.727]  Sounds like a lot in media, it's not.
[00:26:01.727 --> 00:26:04.688]  It's truly David versus Goliath.
[00:26:04.688 --> 00:26:08.169]  The New York Times cost $500 million a year to run.
[00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:09.289]  They're losing money.
[00:26:09.289 --> 00:26:14.190]  Owned by kingpins and drug dealers and a coalition of the Legion of Doom.
[00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.750]  We're funded by you.
[00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.471]  And so, for the hardcore audience that's tuned in on Memorial Day,
[00:26:19.605 --> 00:26:35.010]  You've seen the fruits, you've seen our steadfastness, you've seen our commitment to the Republic, our commitment to the free market, our commitment to religious freedom, our commitment to the West, and our commitment to not back down, and it's that spirit of not backing down the enemy hates.
[00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.371]  But I need viewers and listeners to understand something.
[00:26:38.371 --> 00:26:40.131]  This is the big fight.
[00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:46.233]  All the other battles leading up to this were important, but we're entering, in the next few years, the next four years,
[00:26:47.699 --> 00:27:01.084]  Climaxes, and battles, and grand finales, and wars, and firebombings, and mass shootings, and false flags, and all hell is about to break loose.
[00:27:01.084 --> 00:27:06.847]  Now, we are peaceful when it comes to offense, but we'll defend ourselves when it comes to defense.
[00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:21.395]  But I'm telling everybody, get ready, get geared up, and do whatever you can now to reach out to people, to warn people, and to spread the word about broadcasts that are telling the truth.
[00:27:21.395 --> 00:27:26.737]  And I encourage you to start your own newsletter, to start your own local newspaper.
[00:27:26.737 --> 00:27:30.859]  As the censorship intensifies, old-fashioned radios can be more important than ever.
[00:27:30.859 --> 00:27:36.301]  As the censorship intensifies, local little newspapers you hand out yourself will be more precious than ever.
[00:27:38.462 --> 00:27:52.437]  As we go into this fight, we are shaping the future of the world and our destinies and everything together.
[00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:57.103]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com and get staples like coffee,
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:17.522]  And get staples like fish oil and staples like protein bars are the highest quality that you need for you and your family, that when you buy from us, you're funding individuals totally and completely, absolutely a trillion percent committed, committed.
[00:28:18.547 --> 00:28:38.587]  Committed to exposing these rats, and we're having huge victories, but the enemy's fighting for its life right now, and the enemy is pouring billions a month into their fake news, and into their life as garbage, and it's not working, so they're pumping even more in, and while they sue us, and harass us, and lie about us, and boycott us, and try to sabotage us, so we won't be on the field,
[00:28:39.227 --> 00:28:42.448]  When they roll out their final operations.
[00:28:42.448 --> 00:28:43.788]  Well, we're gonna be on the field.
[00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:44.909]  Thanks for your support.
[00:28:44.909 --> 00:28:53.411]  But everybody should go get the Memorial Day specials up to 60% off at infowarestore.com and fund not just the Second American Revolution, but 1776 worldwide!
[00:28:59.608 --> 00:29:01.590]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:06.894]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.894 --> 00:29:08.496]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.496 --> 00:29:16.843]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.843 --> 00:29:22.528]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.688 --> 00:29:24.530]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.793]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.793 --> 00:29:31.199]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:33.381]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:33.381 --> 00:29:41.271]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[00:30:02.193 --> 00:30:04.034]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[00:30:04.034 --> 00:30:04.934]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[00:30:04.934 --> 00:30:06.295]  You are the man, Alex.
[00:30:06.295 --> 00:30:07.816]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[00:30:07.816 --> 00:30:08.616]  I'm so excited.
[00:30:08.616 --> 00:30:09.516]  I'm such a big fan.
[00:30:09.516 --> 00:30:11.997]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[00:30:11.997 --> 00:30:14.498]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[00:30:14.498 --> 00:30:15.919]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:15.919 --> 00:30:17.360]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.760]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.021]  The Bone Broth.
[00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:24.763]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[00:30:24.763 --> 00:30:26.063]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:26.063 --> 00:30:27.364]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:27.364 --> 00:30:28.745]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[00:30:29.585 --> 00:30:30.225]  Good!
[00:30:30.225 --> 00:30:30.845]  Whoa!
[00:30:30.845 --> 00:30:32.546]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:30:32.546 --> 00:30:36.746]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[00:30:36.746 --> 00:30:40.547]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:42.567]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[00:30:42.567 --> 00:30:45.128]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[00:30:45.128 --> 00:30:45.888]  I'm thanking you.
[00:30:45.888 --> 00:30:52.329]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[00:30:52.329 --> 00:30:53.069]  It is next level.
[00:30:53.069 --> 00:30:53.729]  It really is good.
[00:30:53.729 --> 00:30:54.269]  So thank you.
[00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:56.210]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.570]  Thank you.
[00:31:00.106 --> 00:31:03.131]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:05.714]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[00:31:05.714 --> 00:31:08.498]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[00:31:08.498 --> 00:31:10.481]  And the globalists are so upset.
[00:31:10.481 --> 00:31:13.305]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[00:31:14.557 --> 00:31:19.619]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets you take in the morning and you take at night.
[00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:20.579]  So we looked at that.
[00:31:20.579 --> 00:31:22.200]  We made the very best a.m.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:22.640]  and p.m.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:30.943]  packets out there with an incredible spectrum of 13 different capsules that you take in two servings a day that are game-changing a.m.
[00:31:30.943 --> 00:31:32.004]  and p.m.
[00:31:32.004 --> 00:31:34.625]  total health and performance 8-pack
[00:31:35.703 --> 00:31:38.664]  PowerStack at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:58.993]  We looked at the best-selling products out there, and we made it even better, and we lowered the price.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.901]  Patriots are on the go.
[00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:06.624]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[00:32:06.624 --> 00:32:17.070]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:21.233]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[00:32:21.233 --> 00:32:24.115]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[00:32:24.795 --> 00:32:28.518]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar.
[00:32:28.518 --> 00:32:32.060]  No one can top that, and it funds Liberty and the fight against the Globalists.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.322]  With 15 grams of protein and so much more, they're amazing.
[00:32:35.322 --> 00:32:44.949]  Secure your box of high-quality InfoWars Life protein bars today, and you will be impressed, and you will reorder them, and you will help fund the operation to break the Globalists back.
[00:32:44.949 --> 00:32:45.790]  It's up to you.
[00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.150]  It's easy.
[00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:48.132]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:23.097 --> 00:33:26.789]  Welcome to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:28.214]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:30.498 --> 00:33:36.481]  And Owen Schroyer riding shotgun live on this Memorial Day special victory edition.
[00:33:36.481 --> 00:33:40.823]  And joining us in the next 45 minutes or so, Paul Joseph Watson from London, England.
[00:33:40.823 --> 00:33:46.945]  He's been in Parliament covering UKIP, covering the Brexit movement, covering Nigel Farage.
[00:33:46.945 --> 00:33:49.987]  It's an incredible time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:49.987 --> 00:33:55.409]  Le Pen beats Macron in France as nationalists gain an EU vote.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.061]  European elections.
[00:33:58.061 --> 00:34:03.484]  Italy stunned as Salvini wins majority and says a new Europe is born.
[00:34:03.484 --> 00:34:11.088]  Again, these are parliamentary elections, so it takes two or three rounds, two or three elections to ever remove an establishment party.
[00:34:11.088 --> 00:34:14.430]  He just won in the second round.
[00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:19.993]  Merkel has lost six rounds and through fraud in over 20 parties in Germany, she stayed in
[00:34:21.127 --> 00:34:26.469]  By making deals with the other coalitions, but now her party's getting less than 10% of the vote.
[00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.390]  She's going to have to step down.
[00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:29.831]  European elections.
[00:34:29.831 --> 00:34:33.353]  Italy stunned as Salvini wins majority and says a new Europe is born.
[00:34:33.353 --> 00:34:35.854]  Merkel's coalition in crisis.
[00:34:35.854 --> 00:34:40.416]  Talks after EU vote debacle, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:41.394 --> 00:34:47.478]  Could Nigel Farage become the Prime Minister with the new Brexit party, only six and a half weeks old?
[00:34:47.478 --> 00:34:51.021]  The most powerful, fast-growing party in Europe.
[00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:56.604]  Le Pen demands Macron dissolve Parliament after globalist is dealt humiliating defeat.
[00:34:56.604 --> 00:35:03.329]  Paul Joseph Watson, InfoWars.com story right now.
[00:35:03.329 --> 00:35:05.050]  Here's my questions for Paul.
[00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:08.613]  We'll go to him in a moment, who's the expert on this over in the UK.
[00:35:08.613 --> 00:35:10.234]  But you, Owen, you made the point earlier
[00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:20.153]  How is the deep state globally that ties itself together, as Trump has said, the EU, Australia, the UK caught illegally spying on him at the behest of Obama.
[00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:21.154]  Trump's the president.
[00:35:21.154 --> 00:35:22.915]  He has all that classified info.
[00:35:22.915 --> 00:35:27.199]  He's saying declassify it all, showing the total illegality.
[00:35:27.199 --> 00:35:31.603]  It'll be an international scandal the likes of which we've never seen.
[00:35:31.603 --> 00:35:33.285]  How big will that be?
[00:35:33.285 --> 00:35:35.126]  How are they going to counter strike against this?
[00:35:36.187 --> 00:35:51.216]  Well, I think if you take the paradigm of globalism in Europe, and then that coming to the West, that was the whole goal.
[00:35:51.216 --> 00:35:54.518]  You start it in Europe, you test run it there, and then you bring it out in the West.
[00:35:56.849 --> 00:35:57.650]  We're good to go.
[00:36:15.223 --> 00:36:19.329]  Nationalism was a test case in the West to then bring to Europe.
[00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:30.703]  So it seems like how we were kind of behind with all the leftist trendy garbage from Europe catching up to here in the West, now they're starting to catch up to all the nationalism that we started when we elected Trump.
[00:36:30.703 --> 00:36:32.225]  Trump's launching all these investigations.
[00:36:32.225 --> 00:36:33.147]  He's talking about treason.
[00:36:33.487 --> 00:36:37.890]  Well, I think you're going to start seeing some of that go on once some of these nationalists get into power.
[00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.752]  But, you know, you see these headlines, Alex.
[00:36:39.752 --> 00:36:40.632]  European elections.
[00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:43.614]  Italy stunned as Salvini wins majority and says a new Europe is born.
[00:36:43.614 --> 00:36:46.036]  What does that remind you of?
[00:36:46.036 --> 00:36:50.359]  2016, when Trump won and they said, stunned, nobody saw it coming.
[00:36:50.359 --> 00:36:54.762]  This is the same arrogance that we saw from the left in America.
[00:36:54.762 --> 00:36:56.103]  Of course Trump was going to win.
[00:36:56.103 --> 00:36:58.365]  He won a rigged election.
[00:36:58.365 --> 00:37:01.807]  These people are so arrogant, they think just because they say it is, it is.
[00:37:02.648 --> 00:37:08.116]  And I look at that picture of Le Pen, and it really kind of puts, I think, the attitude into perspective.
[00:37:08.116 --> 00:37:09.498]  It's like, no.
[00:37:09.498 --> 00:37:12.061]  You arrogantly thought you controlled this country.
[00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:14.224]  You arrogantly thought you controlled the vote.
[00:37:14.224 --> 00:37:17.589]  And you arrogantly thought you could bully people out of controlling their own fate.
[00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:18.350]  And you lost!
[00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.331]  That's right, so how are they going to counter-strike?
[00:37:20.331 --> 00:37:22.053]  I'm going to come back to you and ask you that.
[00:37:22.053 --> 00:37:26.356]  I'm going to ask Paul, the latest, to break it all down, how the establishment is going to take this.
[00:37:26.356 --> 00:37:44.811]  But speaking of arrogance, Owen, here is just five days ago, Junker, the literal Nazi heir of the most powerful Nazi family, German royalty, the Junker dynasty, the royalty of Luxembourg, here they are saying stupid people in Europe love their countries, they're so stupid, we're going to bring all the foreigners in, ha ha ha.
[00:37:44.811 --> 00:37:45.331]  Speaking of
[00:37:46.693 --> 00:37:48.554]  Marie Antoinette saying, let them eat cake.
[00:37:48.554 --> 00:37:52.938]  No one knows if she really said that before they stormed the Bastille to start the French Revolution.
[00:37:52.938 --> 00:37:54.039]  But he did say this.
[00:37:54.039 --> 00:37:55.340]  Here it is.
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:06.649]  People are looking at us as if we were a kind of peace god because we have achieved on this continent what has not been achieved elsewhere.
[00:38:06.649 --> 00:38:11.413]  We have 60 wars for the time being, globally spoken.
[00:38:12.868 --> 00:38:20.057]  None in Europe, apart Ukraine, which is part of Europe, but which is not part of the European Union.
[00:38:20.057 --> 00:38:29.569]  These populist nationalists, stupid nationalists, they are in love with their own country, and they don't like the others.
[00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:31.652]  In some countries of the European Union,
[00:38:33.157 --> 00:38:36.902]  The government, parliaments, the national parliaments.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:52.887]  But now that Parliament itself is repudiating you, and the word is the EU is going to break up very soon.
[00:38:52.887 --> 00:38:56.812]  Paul Joseph Watson, the real expert on this, with summit.news.
[00:38:56.812 --> 00:39:00.518]  You also edit for infowars.com and newswars.com.
[00:39:00.518 --> 00:39:01.679]  This is a pretty big deal.
[00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:04.423]  How would you quantify what just unfolded in the last three days?
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:11.505]  Well, it's a complete repudiation of this notion, Alex, that we heard in 2017.
[00:39:11.505 --> 00:39:16.890]  Remember when Macron was elected President of France, that populism was dead.
[00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:25.098]  That's what we were told in May 2017 when he was elected, that this was the end of the road, the Brexit-Trump wave was over.
[00:39:25.678 --> 00:39:30.140]  Well that's proven to be completely false in terms of what happened in France yesterday.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.240]  But overall it's kind of a mixed bag.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.201]  Obviously you've got massive success for the Brexit party.
[00:39:35.201 --> 00:39:49.466]  What they've done to the globalist credit in this Machiavellian way is they've demoralized the voter by indoctrinating them that their vote doesn't mean anything because it's just going to be overridden.
[00:39:49.466 --> 00:39:52.587]  And that's why you saw in the UK specifically
[00:39:53.969 --> 00:40:02.276]  First of all, lower turnout on average compared to other European countries and higher turnout in remain voting areas.
[00:40:02.276 --> 00:40:15.687]  So the people who voted to stay in the EU in 2016, they were more enthusiastic about voting in yesterday's elections because in those areas they got out to the polls more, which means obviously
[00:40:16.314 --> 00:40:21.316]  So we have had this complete political disenfranchisement of voters in the United Kingdom.
[00:40:21.316 --> 00:40:40.764]  Leave voters, because after three years of Brexit being made deliberately a total mess of, being deliberately sabotaged, many of those people who voted Leave in 2016 did stay home, because again they think that their vote has no impact whatsoever, that it's just going to be overridden.
[00:40:40.764 --> 00:40:41.845]  But even with that,
[00:40:42.879 --> 00:40:50.284]  Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, which again, to remind people, started out of nothing six weeks ago.
[00:40:50.284 --> 00:40:54.808]  It was at 15% in the polls, it was at 20%, it was at 25%.
[00:40:54.808 --> 00:40:58.030]  By the end of it, it was up to 30-35%.
[00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:04.535]  Got more votes than the two establishment parties, Conservative Party and Labour Party, combined.
[00:41:05.385 --> 00:41:19.214]  Okay, so what we're seeing is not only a populist backlash, a resurgence of populism, which by the way is global, and I'll get onto that in a bit, but this is the complete repudiation of the two-party system.
[00:41:19.214 --> 00:41:21.196]  I don't think we've ever seen anything like this
[00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:25.414]  In Europe at least for generations Alex.
[00:41:25.414 --> 00:41:31.798]  So we have a situation now whereby obviously Theresa May the Prime Minister resigned or said she would resign on Friday.
[00:41:31.798 --> 00:41:35.079]  She's going to step down at the start of next month.
[00:41:35.079 --> 00:41:43.204]  We've got a Tory leadership contest coming up where they're going to squabble between who's going to lead the Tory party and obviously by extension the country.
[00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:54.818]  Now Nigel Farage has created this massive pressure group to the point where he's now demanding an in on the negotiations with the EU with his Brexit party.
[00:41:54.818 --> 00:42:05.665]  But obviously now if the Conservative Party does not deliver Brexit before October 31st, which is their new deadline, you know six months after they said it would be done on March 31st,
[00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:20.532]  They are going to get completely crushed in the next general election because Farage will run with his Brexit party in the national elections and he will take away that vote which will ensure the Conservative Party won't be returned to power.
[00:42:20.532 --> 00:42:23.254]  So that is the pressure gauge that's now being put on them.
[00:42:23.254 --> 00:42:24.955]  That's what he promised to do.
[00:42:24.955 --> 00:42:26.575]  No more Mr Nice Guy.
[00:42:26.575 --> 00:42:28.757]  Now if they don't deliver Brexit before October 31st
[00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:33.172]  Their political future in Westminster is completely finished.
[00:42:33.172 --> 00:42:35.054]  So that's what this has achieved.
[00:42:35.054 --> 00:42:37.175]  Bottom line, get your popcorn out, folks.
[00:42:37.175 --> 00:42:40.398]  This is going to be wild and it's going to be dangerous.
[00:42:40.398 --> 00:42:41.498]  And by the way, you're not a spectator.
[00:42:41.498 --> 00:42:42.499]  You're in the arena.
[00:42:42.499 --> 00:42:44.500]  What's happening in Europe totally affects us.
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.042]  This is globalism on its heels.
[00:42:46.042 --> 00:42:48.083]  But as Paul said, they're running the PSYOP.
[00:42:48.083 --> 00:42:49.444]  Your vote doesn't count.
[00:42:49.444 --> 00:42:51.385]  Remember three years ago?
[00:42:51.385 --> 00:42:51.746]  Remember?
[00:42:51.746 --> 00:42:53.067]  It was Brexit actually brought Trump in.
[00:42:53.067 --> 00:42:54.968]  Remember what I said?
[00:42:54.968 --> 00:42:56.229]  I'll repeat it when we come back.
[00:42:56.229 --> 00:42:56.929]  It's critical.
[00:42:56.929 --> 00:42:57.330]  It's key.
[00:42:59.778 --> 00:43:01.080]  Shut down our speech!
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:06.586]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:43:06.586 --> 00:43:14.075]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:43:14.075 --> 00:43:15.417]  Are you coming back?
[00:43:15.417 --> 00:43:16.558]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:18.421]  We're at NewsWars.com.
[00:43:18.421 --> 00:43:20.744]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[00:43:20.744 --> 00:43:21.705]  We have our own videos.
[00:43:21.705 --> 00:43:22.766]  We have our own articles.
[00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:27.532]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[00:43:27.532 --> 00:43:29.795]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:43:29.795 --> 00:43:31.337]  InfoWars!
[00:43:31.337 --> 00:43:33.059]  Don't tell me!
[00:43:33.059 --> 00:43:33.440]  Woo!
[00:43:36.124 --> 00:43:39.185]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:43:39.185 --> 00:43:40.726]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:43:40.726 --> 00:43:43.767]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:43.767 --> 00:43:45.668]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:43:45.668 --> 00:43:49.169]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:43:49.169 --> 00:43:51.910]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.331]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:55.191]  That's where they find it.
[00:43:55.191 --> 00:43:56.992]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:43:56.992 --> 00:43:57.572]  They just go there.
[00:43:59.491 --> 00:44:11.278]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:44:11.278 --> 00:44:17.482]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[00:44:17.482 --> 00:44:19.643]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[00:44:19.643 --> 00:44:23.766]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[00:44:24.646 --> 00:44:31.348]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.
[00:44:31.348 --> 00:44:42.052]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[00:44:42.572 --> 00:44:44.815]  Our Ultimate Bone Broth Formula is amazing.
[00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:49.681]  It's 50% off right now at InfoWarsTour.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[00:44:49.681 --> 00:44:52.544]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[00:44:52.544 --> 00:44:58.691]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[00:45:01.368 --> 00:45:08.672]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:45:08.672 --> 00:45:11.694]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:45:11.694 --> 00:45:13.415]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[00:45:13.415 --> 00:45:16.097]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:45:16.097 --> 00:45:17.598]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:45:17.598 --> 00:45:24.061]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:45:24.061 --> 00:45:26.563]  So remember, you are the InfoWarp.
[00:45:26.563 --> 00:45:28.384]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[00:45:28.384 --> 00:45:29.945]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:45:30.345 --> 00:45:35.748]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWarsStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:45:35.748 --> 00:45:43.213]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:45:43.213 --> 00:45:44.914]  So I want to thank you for your support.
[00:45:44.914 --> 00:45:46.315]  I want to encourage you again.
[00:45:46.315 --> 00:45:51.238]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[00:45:51.238 --> 00:45:54.400]  We have thousands of them and it makes this all possible.
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.502]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:45:56.502 --> 00:45:56.942]  God bless you.
[00:46:00.805 --> 00:46:11.870]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:20.734]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[00:46:20.734 --> 00:46:24.736]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[00:46:25.436 --> 00:46:31.899]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[00:46:31.899 --> 00:46:34.059]  And you may be experiencing back-up too.
[00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:40.002]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy-Powder.
[00:46:40.002 --> 00:46:42.563]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[00:46:43.243 --> 00:46:53.652]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, Oxy-Powder from Infowarsstore.com will clear it out, guaranteed.
[00:46:53.652 --> 00:47:03.320]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with Oxy-Powder.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:05.943]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:25.896 --> 00:47:26.816]  All right.
[00:47:26.816 --> 00:47:30.917]  We are the most banned, most demonized, most lied about broadcast.
[00:47:30.917 --> 00:47:31.878]  For a good reason.
[00:47:31.878 --> 00:47:33.918]  And I want to explain this again.
[00:47:33.918 --> 00:47:37.119]  I'm not up there saying, hey man, I'm really smart.
[00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:40.460]  Look, you know, I'm number one in the enemy's eyes.
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:41.921]  It's because we really research.
[00:47:43.373 --> 00:47:45.514]  We really are engaged.
[00:47:45.514 --> 00:47:48.677]  And governments and intelligence agencies listen.
[00:47:48.677 --> 00:47:58.883]  The globalists had a strategy to put out in the last 50, 60 years of TV and movies, 70 years, just disinfo and pablum and dumbed down garbage.
[00:47:58.883 --> 00:48:06.208]  But along came the internet and the globalists were so arrogant that thousands of different individuals started shows on the internet.
[00:48:06.208 --> 00:48:09.631]  But I was able to get on talk radio on hundreds of stations.
[00:48:10.936 --> 00:48:23.480]  And I was able to infect, to use Brian Stelter and the Clinton Foundation and others own words, I was able to infect Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:26.001]  You tune into them now, they sound just like me.
[00:48:26.001 --> 00:48:27.862]  They're not copying what I said.
[00:48:27.862 --> 00:48:30.423]  They're now actually took the blinders off.
[00:48:30.423 --> 00:48:33.244]  They see exactly what I see.
[00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:35.444]  So it's not like I'm telling Trump what to say.
[00:48:35.444 --> 00:48:37.065]  He just sees the same damn thing.
[00:48:37.065 --> 00:48:40.086]  We're promoting Americana and freedom
[00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:46.651]  Versus globalism and communism and corporate crony tyranny?
[00:48:46.651 --> 00:48:48.332]  Fascism?
[00:48:48.332 --> 00:48:50.812]  Should be pretty easy to sell that, right?
[00:48:50.812 --> 00:48:51.972]  I've believed in you.
[00:48:51.972 --> 00:48:53.313]  I bet on you.
[00:48:53.313 --> 00:48:53.933]  And you know what?
[00:48:53.933 --> 00:48:55.593]  You've been coming through.
[00:48:55.593 --> 00:48:56.673]  I've been coming through.
[00:48:56.673 --> 00:48:57.694]  Paul Watson's been coming through.
[00:48:57.694 --> 00:49:04.015]  And Owen's right that Trump helped supercharge nationalism and populism two and a half years ago worldwide.
[00:49:04.015 --> 00:49:07.416]  But it really happened with Nigel Farage and Brexit.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.861]  And UKIP.
[00:49:09.861 --> 00:49:10.842]  And they have their own spat.
[00:49:10.842 --> 00:49:11.842]  He's got Brexit.
[00:49:11.842 --> 00:49:12.543]  Hey, fine.
[00:49:12.543 --> 00:49:13.904]  More nationalist parties.
[00:49:13.904 --> 00:49:15.225]  More patriot parties.
[00:49:15.225 --> 00:49:18.387]  And there's dozens of them in Europe that are growing fast.
[00:49:18.387 --> 00:49:24.072]  It's not just Brexit that's the biggest and then UKIP and then others.
[00:49:24.072 --> 00:49:29.656]  It's dozens and dozens because, again, some countries have up to 50 different parties.
[00:49:29.656 --> 00:49:36.221]  That's one reason they want to get rid of the constitutional system that we have here with Electoral College.
[00:49:37.332 --> 00:49:46.119]  Because then you have the states with more population enslaving those that don't have a population, the tyranny of the majority, a pure democracy, very dangerous.
[00:49:47.609 --> 00:49:50.851]  And you could have 50 parties.
[00:49:50.851 --> 00:49:53.872]  People are always, I want more parties, I want more parties.
[00:49:53.872 --> 00:49:56.054]  I notice the left's always pushing that.
[00:49:56.054 --> 00:50:02.737]  And sure, it's good to have some libertarian, you know, party or whatever, but they usually just take away from the conservative party, don't they?
[00:50:02.737 --> 00:50:06.319]  Instead, the libertarians have taken over the Republican Party.
[00:50:06.319 --> 00:50:08.580]  We've almost completed the conversion.
[00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:12.082]  So let me make the huge announcement and go back to Paul and go back to Owen.
[00:50:12.082 --> 00:50:15.544]  I want to trifecta here.
[00:50:15.544 --> 00:50:16.725]  I'd like to give myself credit.
[00:50:17.779 --> 00:50:27.306]  But three and a half years ago, when Brexit passed, or almost three and a half years ago, but three years ago and change, Financial Times of London is an establishment paper.
[00:50:27.306 --> 00:50:32.149]  So it communicates, more than even the New York Times, to the establishment.
[00:50:32.149 --> 00:50:41.176]  And they said, we'll do what we've done with other countries that never voted to be in the EU, most of them never did, they thought it was a trade deal, just like TPP or other scams they run against America.
[00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:49.993]  And so they said, just like Ireland voted no to be in the EU over and over again because they demanded a vote, they finally did it the third time.
[00:50:49.993 --> 00:50:51.834]  Other countries never voted to be in here.
[00:50:51.834 --> 00:50:54.897]  We'll just hold it up and they'll get demoralized.
[00:50:54.897 --> 00:50:56.919]  So what Paul's saying is true.
[00:50:56.919 --> 00:50:59.602]  But listen, they held it up.
[00:50:59.602 --> 00:51:01.904]  It takes three years to remove May.
[00:51:01.904 --> 00:51:02.645]  It doesn't matter.
[00:51:02.645 --> 00:51:04.327]  You get stronger, they get weaker.
[00:51:05.202 --> 00:51:12.684]  Three years ago, most people didn't know that England never voted to join the, or Scotland or Ireland, Ireland did, to join the EU.
[00:51:12.684 --> 00:51:16.544]  Now people know about this and there's no putting it back together again.
[00:51:16.544 --> 00:51:20.885]  And even if you still have an EU, it'll all be run by nationalists and patriots soon.
[00:51:20.885 --> 00:51:25.446]  And it'll all go back to the way it was, which is Renaissance.
[00:51:25.446 --> 00:51:28.887]  Not way back to the tyranny of the system.
[00:51:28.887 --> 00:51:30.327]  But Paul's absolutely right.
[00:51:30.327 --> 00:51:34.288]  They run this Svengali of, oh look, you didn't get what you wanted.
[00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:41.262]  You didn't get it within three years, you're demoralized, and then people bought it.
[00:51:41.262 --> 00:51:47.972]  Record low turnout by Briggs voters, and record high turnout by the state, the Minions.
[00:51:49.329 --> 00:51:52.111]  They still lost, though, overall.
[00:51:52.111 --> 00:51:53.172]  But it's parliamentary.
[00:51:53.172 --> 00:51:56.674]  It'll take multiple elections to remove the establishment.
[00:51:56.674 --> 00:51:58.195]  But it's already happening in Germany.
[00:51:58.195 --> 00:51:59.556]  It's already about to happen in France.
[00:51:59.556 --> 00:52:01.477]  It's already happening in Greece.
[00:52:01.477 --> 00:52:03.698]  It's already happening in Italy, especially.
[00:52:03.698 --> 00:52:05.860]  So this is a long fight, folks!
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:07.060]  This is a marathon!
[00:52:08.032 --> 00:52:10.033]  This is not a sprint.
[00:52:10.033 --> 00:52:11.813]  Slow and easy wins the race.
[00:52:11.813 --> 00:52:13.153]  We have the moral right.
[00:52:13.153 --> 00:52:14.854]  We have the moral superiority.
[00:52:14.854 --> 00:52:17.295]  We have the votes of the people.
[00:52:17.295 --> 00:52:20.175]  We have Juncker arrogantly saying, Oh, I hate nationalists.
[00:52:20.175 --> 00:52:30.858]  So I think we win in the end, but I agree with you, Paul, getting the message out that this is a long 12 round heavyweight boxing match, not a hundred yard dash is critical.
[00:52:30.858 --> 00:52:32.239]  So we don't buy the psyop.
[00:52:32.239 --> 00:52:34.780]  Please continue.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:35.840]  Well, exactly, Alex.
[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:36.040]  I mean,
[00:52:36.821 --> 00:52:43.864]  And to zoom out from that, before we get back into the weeds, you know, the Brexit Party is the biggest party in the European Parliament now.
[00:52:43.864 --> 00:52:46.605]  It's bigger than Angela Merkel's party.
[00:52:46.605 --> 00:52:54.528]  Worldwide, we just had an election in Australia where the Conservative Populist candidate was widely expected to lose.
[00:52:54.528 --> 00:52:56.009]  All the polls said he was going to lose.
[00:52:56.009 --> 00:52:56.689]  He won!
[00:52:57.304 --> 00:53:02.107]  We just had the biggest democratic election in the world in India.
[00:53:02.107 --> 00:53:04.029]  Guess who won by a landslide?
[00:53:04.029 --> 00:53:05.210]  A populist.
[00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:08.432]  So this trend isn't going away anytime soon.
[00:53:08.432 --> 00:53:11.174]  To zoom in on that, they're playing this numbers game.
[00:53:12.071 --> 00:53:24.375]  Where they say, oh, if we add up the vote for the Lib Dems, the Lib Dems were the party of remain, and then we add the Change UK vote, which was the cuck party, which was completely pathetic.
[00:53:24.375 --> 00:53:31.678]  This was the so-called independent party, which was started by establishment politicians who just left their establishment parties.
[00:53:31.678 --> 00:53:32.738]  They got 3%.
[00:53:32.738 --> 00:53:34.258]  They were completely crushed.
[00:53:34.258 --> 00:53:35.699]  They were beaten even by UKIP.
[00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:46.284]  So they say, oh, if we add up the Lib Dems, the Greens and the Change UK Party, that means that more people who wanted to remain in the EU won the election.
[00:53:46.284 --> 00:53:47.545]  Well, then you drill down to it.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.262]  And you look at what the Green Party voters wanted.
[00:53:51.262 --> 00:53:58.266]  Their primary issue in the UK was, quote, they had the best policies on issues other than Brexit.
[00:53:58.266 --> 00:54:03.790]  So the people voting for the Green Party weren't voting for the Green Party because they were voting for Remain.
[00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:06.271]  They were voting for environmentalism.
[00:54:06.271 --> 00:54:12.115]  So this fake numbers game of, oh, if we add up these parties and these parties and these parties, it means we've won.
[00:54:12.115 --> 00:54:14.857]  It's like, you know, calling for a second referendum.
[00:54:14.857 --> 00:54:16.338]  But the other issue is with the
[00:54:17.259 --> 00:54:18.060]  Green Party.
[00:54:35.779 --> 00:54:37.561]  Boy, as you're just saying, I see the numbers.
[00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:45.251]  There are a lot of leftist groups now in Germany that don't want open borders, that want out of the EU as well, because they know the plan is to take their pension funds.
[00:54:45.251 --> 00:54:50.958]  So what you're really saying is, the left more and more is actually getting ready to join the populist movement.
[00:54:52.597 --> 00:55:01.422]  Well yeah, but the problem is leftist parties are far better at forming coalitions, both at national and European level, which is what you were talking about before the break.
[00:55:01.422 --> 00:55:13.809]  So you've got all these tons of different parties, libertarian, right-wing, populist, whatever, they're all segregated and they find it very hard to communicate and join together, because leftists, being collectivists, have always been better at that.
[00:55:14.289 --> 00:55:21.291]  The point many people are making today, how do you take a vote share out of that Green Party vote throughout Europe?
[00:55:21.291 --> 00:55:27.153]  Because the Green Parties throughout Europe in all these different countries have done very well for themselves.
[00:55:27.153 --> 00:55:31.515]  So you have to take on board some kind of environmentalist message
[00:55:31.955 --> 00:55:32.656]  We're good to go.
[00:55:47.862 --> 00:55:53.045]  As we've argued for two decades, man-made climate change is a complete scam.
[00:55:53.045 --> 00:55:54.226]  It's a Ponzi scheme.
[00:55:54.226 --> 00:56:03.592]  But that doesn't mean there aren't some real environmental issues which the populist right can address, which then we can take some of that vote share from the Green Party.
[00:56:03.592 --> 00:56:05.913]  And it is things like halal slaughter.
[00:56:05.913 --> 00:56:09.295]  It is things like, you know, plastic in the oceans, deforestation.
[00:56:09.295 --> 00:56:10.016]  No, I agree, Paul.
[00:56:10.016 --> 00:56:10.656]  Stay right there.
[00:56:10.656 --> 00:56:11.977]  These are real issues.
[00:56:11.977 --> 00:56:13.197]  Man-made global warming isn't.
[00:56:13.197 --> 00:56:15.559]  But you can take some of those issues, address them, and get that vote.
[00:56:15.919 --> 00:56:16.299]  I agree.
[00:56:16.299 --> 00:56:23.684]  Run as an environmentalist, but say global warming is a distraction from the overfishing, from the toxic waste dumping, from all of those issues.
[00:56:23.684 --> 00:56:27.507]  We're going to come right back, continue your take, and get Owen's take on all this.
[00:56:27.507 --> 00:56:39.015]  But the big takeaway, though, Paul, is despite all the media blackouts, the attacks on patriot parties, they were the biggest winners overall, and this scares the hell out of the establishment.
[00:56:39.015 --> 00:56:39.535]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:40.745 --> 00:57:03.300]  Please don't forget, we're not funded by George Soros, we're not funded by the New World Order, we're funded by you, the listeners, and we're very, very respectful and very, very thankful that, quite frankly, if you're a viewer or a listener and haven't gone to InfoWarsTore.com and gotten the Wake Up America coffee, or gotten fish oil, or gotten our protein bars that are back in stock, or gotten our amazing all-day energy that's healthy and clean, TurboForce that's back in stock, you're crazy.

[00:57:35.092 --> 00:57:36.593]  Yes, you're funding 1776 worldwide.
[00:57:41.876 --> 00:57:49.242]  This whole nationalist movement started in Russia, moved to the UK, came to the US, and is now going worldwide.
[00:57:49.242 --> 00:57:53.425]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:57:53.425 --> 00:57:54.486]  They are technocrats.
[00:57:54.486 --> 00:57:56.767]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:57:56.767 --> 00:58:04.133]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:58:04.133 --> 00:58:06.014]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:58:06.014 --> 00:58:08.096]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:58:08.596 --> 00:58:14.960]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:20.143]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:58:20.143 --> 00:58:29.148]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:58:30.129 --> 00:58:36.113]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B-12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:58:36.113 --> 00:58:37.054]  It is amazing.

[00:58:53.019 --> 00:59:02.445]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[00:59:02.445 --> 00:59:13.452]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee.
[00:59:13.852 --> 00:59:19.776]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land to generate the world's finest coffee beans.

[00:59:53.352 --> 01:00:02.815]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.815 --> 01:00:06.776]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:13.423]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:13.423 --> 01:00:20.926]  We're now taking off.
[01:00:20.926 --> 01:00:29.590]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:35.793]  Alright, we could not be covering more weighty, hardcore topics that the globalists absolutely cannot stand.
[01:00:35.793 --> 01:00:37.434]  I do not want to be on air.
[01:00:38.743 --> 01:00:41.324]  They want thousands of new Netflix shows a year.
[01:00:41.324 --> 01:00:43.745]  Thousands of TV channels.
[01:00:43.745 --> 01:00:45.926]  Thousands of gambling sites.
[01:00:45.926 --> 01:00:47.126]  There's sex everywhere.
[01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:48.147]  Drugs everywhere.
[01:00:48.147 --> 01:00:53.029]  And again, I'm not Mr. Goody Two-Shoes on some mountain like I'm perfect.
[01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:54.509]  I'm just breaking down.
[01:00:54.509 --> 01:00:57.351]  The globalists have a total distraction going on.
[01:00:57.351 --> 01:00:58.531]  And Paul got caught off by the break.
[01:00:58.531 --> 01:00:59.952]  He was trying to finish a critical point.
[01:00:59.952 --> 01:01:01.592]  I could tell he was irritated I was interrupting.
[01:01:01.592 --> 01:01:02.433]  But I had to plug there.
[01:01:02.433 --> 01:01:04.033]  I'm going to bring Owen in.
[01:01:04.033 --> 01:01:05.554]  Paul leaves us in about 15 minutes.
[01:01:05.554 --> 01:01:08.155]  Then we're going to open the phones up and get into all the other news.
[01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:26.459]  Separately, the news blackouts, the demonization, the no platforming of nationalist and patriot candidates across Europe, Juncker's arrogant statements, talk by major governments of outlawing nationalist parties.
[01:01:26.459 --> 01:01:32.762]  This is a devastating reversal for them to have Le Pen beating Macron's party.
[01:01:33.749 --> 01:01:35.010]  And again, it's not like the U.S.
[01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:39.452]  where it's winner-takes-all, it's parliamentary, so they're taking more seats.
[01:01:39.452 --> 01:01:47.316]  European elections, Italy has now taken full control and is dominant, not just with their president, but in the parliament.
[01:01:47.316 --> 01:01:47.916]  That's huge.
[01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:51.578]  Salvini wins majority, says a new Europe is born.
[01:01:51.578 --> 01:01:55.300]  Merkel already has lost, what, seven elections in a row now.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.901]  France 24 says, will she have to step down?
[01:01:57.901 --> 01:01:59.602]  Will Nigel Farage become the next?
[01:02:00.542 --> 01:02:03.564]  Prime Minister, or will it be Boris?
[01:02:03.564 --> 01:02:23.574]  The point is, is that Owen earlier talked about how Trump supercharged nationalism two and a half years ago, but really the only Russian conspiracy there is, Paul, is that Russia hit rock bottom, kicked some of the oligarchs out, created some of their sovereignty again, became Christian again, that's what pisses off Hollywood and the blood-sucking establishment.
[01:02:25.117 --> 01:02:27.479]  And so UKIP's done that.
[01:02:27.479 --> 01:02:29.540]  Other nations are doing that.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.041]  The U.S.
[01:02:30.041 --> 01:02:31.542]  has done that.
[01:02:31.542 --> 01:02:36.125]  But this was all really let out of England, exploded in the U.S., spread all over the world.
[01:02:36.125 --> 01:02:37.086]  What a crazy time.
[01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.087]  You're trying to finish that point.
[01:02:40.293 --> 01:02:41.354]  No, obviously, yeah.
[01:02:41.354 --> 01:02:46.777]  It started back in the probably early 2000s, mid-2000s with the surge of UKIP.
[01:02:46.777 --> 01:02:52.180]  Obviously we had the 2014 European Parliamentary elections where UKIP won.
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.582]  The Brexit Party, of course, this time won by a far bigger margin.
[01:02:56.182 --> 01:03:01.845]  Now, over 30% of seats in the European Parliament are controlled by Eurosceptic parties.
[01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:03.406]  That's the biggest ever.
[01:03:03.406 --> 01:03:12.772]  The so-called Grand Coalition of Centre-Right and Centre-Left parties, the establishment, they've lost their overall majority in the EU Parliament for the first time ever.
[01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:14.734]  So it's horrific for them.
[01:03:14.734 --> 01:03:21.961]  But then look how, for example, CNBC responds to it today with telling us what the experts think about it.
[01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:30.230]  They say, Europeans showed belief in the EU project experts claimed Monday, despite long dominant centrist parties losing ground.
[01:03:30.791 --> 01:03:43.925]  So it's actually saying the experts are telling us that the Brexit party having such success, Le Pen beating Macron, Salvini winning in Italy, that means that people believe in the EU project even more.
[01:03:43.925 --> 01:03:50.552]  Again, shows how completely out of touch they are, which benefits us, that they see this as a victory.
[01:03:50.572 --> 01:03:52.633]  Alright, we've got one more segment with you.
[01:03:52.633 --> 01:03:58.715]  Owen's got a lot to say, he's going to chime in when we come back in about a minute, but the minute we have before we go to break.
[01:04:12.466 --> 01:04:14.349]  Start giving us your view, gut level.
[01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:16.573]  How is the establishment going to strike back?
[01:04:16.573 --> 01:04:24.024]  Multinational corporations that set up the EU, that set up the CHICOMS, that set up the New World Order system, in their own words, to consolidate power.
[01:04:24.024 --> 01:04:24.605]  Think about that.
[01:04:24.605 --> 01:04:27.229]  We're going to go to break, Paul, and I want to ask you and Owen out of the gates.
[01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:29.424]  They're going to strike back.
[01:04:29.424 --> 01:04:30.645]  They're striking back with censorship.
[01:04:30.645 --> 01:04:35.669]  They're striking back with leftist mobs being bullies and physically attacking people.
[01:04:35.669 --> 01:04:37.810]  They're striking back with corporate bullying.
[01:04:37.810 --> 01:04:40.232]  How else are they going to strike back?
[01:04:40.232 --> 01:04:42.774]  I smell false flags.
[01:04:42.774 --> 01:04:46.016]  But, they're out of control of all the governments now.
[01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.657]  And they know they could get caught.
[01:04:47.657 --> 01:04:50.539]  So, the walls are closing in on them, not us.
[01:04:50.539 --> 01:04:52.901]  But, we shouldn't be arrogant.

[01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:33.563]  You got it.
[01:06:33.563 --> 01:06:35.243]  Running around drooling.
[01:06:35.243 --> 01:06:40.665]  No, we're the ghost of the explorers, the trailblazers, the strivers.
[01:06:40.665 --> 01:06:45.807]  And we will go to the stars.
[01:06:45.807 --> 01:06:47.088]  Get behind me, Satan.
[01:06:48.469 --> 01:06:50.832]  Owen Schroer riding shotgun with me throughout the broadcast.
[01:06:50.832 --> 01:06:53.174]  Paul Watson, one more segment to both of you.
[01:06:53.174 --> 01:06:56.197]  Paul Joseph Watson, first, then Owen Schroer.
[01:06:56.197 --> 01:06:58.620]  Devastating defeats for the globalists in Europe.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:00.062]  Devastating defeats in Brazil.
[01:07:00.062 --> 01:07:01.543]  Devastating defeats in Asia.
[01:07:01.543 --> 01:07:02.584]  Devastating defeats here.
[01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:07.747]  How are they going to strike back Paul Joseph Watson?
[01:07:07.747 --> 01:07:11.209]  Let's chronicle some of the ways they've already struck back and what they're going to do next.
[01:07:11.209 --> 01:07:13.590]  Because one thing they never do is give up.
[01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:17.752]  And their arrogance, that is their weakness, is also their strength.
[01:07:17.752 --> 01:07:23.875]  With Juncker saying, you dumb Europeans, you stupid, love your country, we get rid of Europe.
[01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:25.035]  Get rid of Europe and what?
[01:07:25.035 --> 01:07:27.617]  Let it be run by you, the Nazi heir, the dictator?
[01:07:27.617 --> 01:07:30.198]  How will they strike back Paul Watson from London, England?
[01:07:36.021 --> 01:07:39.283]  And his Skype must have just cut out.
[01:07:39.283 --> 01:07:41.324]  All right, let's go to Owen.
[01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:44.225]  Owen, how do you think they strike back?
[01:07:44.225 --> 01:07:46.166]  Well, I don't think this.
[01:07:46.166 --> 01:07:50.568]  I know that the first thing we're going to see is total social media censorship.
[01:07:50.568 --> 01:07:54.570]  I think all smart minds have been predicting this for a while.
[01:07:54.570 --> 01:08:00.893]  And so I would say by 2020, on Twitter and Facebook and YouTube, you won't even find a Trump supporter.
[01:08:00.893 --> 01:08:05.536]  This is going to be their last ditch effort to try to stop Trump from getting reelected, but it'll be too late.
[01:08:06.016 --> 01:08:08.318]  This may even happen within the next couple months or so.
[01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.099]  So I think total social media censorship.
[01:08:10.099 --> 01:08:11.640]  I mean, I've been banned on Facebook.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.262]  Obviously you can't allow it to be anywhere.
[01:08:13.262 --> 01:08:14.723]  I still have a Twitter account.
[01:08:14.723 --> 01:08:15.824]  I don't think I'll have that by 2020.
[01:08:15.824 --> 01:08:18.586]  And I don't think any other Trump supporters will either.
[01:08:18.586 --> 01:08:20.127]  I'm fully expecting that to happen.
[01:08:20.127 --> 01:08:24.790]  Now, what I'm afraid of, and you also alluded to this earlier, is a major false flag.
[01:08:25.771 --> 01:08:26.071]  We're good.
[01:08:40.988 --> 01:08:45.893]  And that's going to be what they hope is a turning point to change the narrative.
[01:08:45.893 --> 01:08:48.916]  Because, I mean, nobody believes CNN and MSNBC anymore.
[01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.037]  Everybody sees the facts.
[01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:51.558]  The left has gotten totally violent.
[01:08:51.558 --> 01:08:53.540]  In fact, they've even committed to domestic terror.
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:56.463]  In fact, Alex, I'll even tell you, I won't give all the information here, but...
[01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:02.231]  I'm being publicly doxxed right now in Austin, Texas, in an extreme manner.
[01:09:02.231 --> 01:09:05.452]  I think people are trying to sabotage me or even have me killed.
[01:09:05.452 --> 01:09:09.293]  So, they're gonna go full bore before 2020.
[01:09:09.293 --> 01:09:14.375]  And you better have your head on a swivel, you better have your head up, or you're gonna get run over.
[01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:18.396]  We know the players, we know the game, watch it all come down.
[01:09:18.396 --> 01:09:25.558]  So that's what I'm expecting in the next, up to 2020 Alex, but I think a hot false flag, and they're gonna try to blame Trump and his supporters,
[01:09:26.258 --> 01:09:27.419]  It probably won't work.
[01:09:27.419 --> 01:09:33.181]  I mean, nothing these people do works anymore, but that doesn't mean they're going to not do it.
[01:09:33.181 --> 01:09:34.601]  I totally agree with you.
[01:09:34.601 --> 01:09:47.907]  And the founder of Antifa that gets tens of millions of dollars from George Soros, he was on The Young Turks two weeks ago saying, we're preparing a violent offensive revolution to take out Trump and his supporters.
[01:09:47.907 --> 01:09:49.687]  So they're not just anti-free speech.
[01:09:49.687 --> 01:09:51.848]  And I agree, they're going to go to false flags.
[01:09:51.848 --> 01:09:52.949]  We'll get into this later.
[01:09:52.949 --> 01:09:53.789]  You've been doxxed.
[01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:55.590]  They're harassing you at your humble abode.
[01:09:57.233 --> 01:10:03.257]  And that's what this comes down to, is that the left really believes this is their takeover time.
[01:10:03.257 --> 01:10:06.039]  They thought it was their takeover time with Hillary, but it's not happening.
[01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:09.561]  So as they get more apocalyptic, they're going to get violent.
[01:10:09.561 --> 01:10:12.643]  Paul Watson, you're over in the UK, you're covering all this.
[01:10:12.643 --> 01:10:16.806]  How do you see the establishment striking back?
[01:10:16.806 --> 01:10:21.289]  Striking back, Alex, by fanning the flames of extremism.
[01:10:21.289 --> 01:10:24.251]  As I said before, people are becoming more disenfranchised.
[01:10:24.904 --> 01:10:44.072]  Because their vote has been overridden and they're being told that their vote means nothing so they're going to lash out in frustration and that's exactly what the establishment wants because then they can exploit it to reclassify speech that they hate as hate speech and this is exactly what we're seeing with the deplatforming.
[01:10:44.072 --> 01:10:52.735]  It's no coincidence Alex that two weeks before the vote in Spain the populist Vox party was completely deplatformed on Facebook
[01:10:53.456 --> 01:10:55.498]  Lost millions of followers.
[01:10:55.498 --> 01:10:56.439]  Oh, and look what happened.
[01:10:56.439 --> 01:10:58.921]  The Vox party underperformed in Spain.
[01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:00.542]  Well, what a coincidence.
[01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:07.528]  You had Tommy Robinson running a campaign off a Telegram app, basically, because they de-platformed him on everything else.
[01:11:07.528 --> 01:11:09.089]  He needed about 8% to win.
[01:11:09.089 --> 01:11:13.773]  He got about 3%, which is impressive for an independent candidate, by the way.
[01:11:13.773 --> 01:11:17.957]  But again, he had to fight this election with both arms tied behind his back.
[01:11:18.797 --> 01:11:28.143]  Because they created the hysteria through the extremism which they found in the first place to create the justification to ban him on social media.
[01:11:28.143 --> 01:11:39.071]  And then they say that we're creating violence by our rhetoric saying we don't want to be globalist slaves and then they come attack us and then they take our speech saying we caused Antifa to attack us.
[01:11:40.458 --> 01:11:40.998]  Yeah.
[01:11:40.998 --> 01:11:42.819]  They take away people's speech.
[01:11:42.819 --> 01:11:44.219]  They radicalise people.
[01:11:44.219 --> 01:11:45.400]  That's the effect that it has.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:52.042]  If you take away people's access to public platforms to express their legitimate grievances, that only radicalises them.
[01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:59.905]  So, a small minority will lash out with violence, and that's exactly what they want, because they can exploit it to silence their competition.
[01:12:00.425 --> 01:12:02.667]  That's what happened with Tommy and with Vox.
[01:12:02.667 --> 01:12:04.048]  And take Ireland.
[01:12:04.048 --> 01:12:12.615]  When the Irish finally figured out that British intelligence, this has been declassified, I had steak knife, code name steak knife on.
[01:12:12.615 --> 01:12:14.576]  He was killed two weeks later for coming on the show.
[01:12:14.576 --> 01:12:16.958]  Seriously, folks, I had steak knife on like 12 years ago.
[01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.199]  They murdered him.
[01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:19.640]  And he just said, I got tired of doing it.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.641]  We would blow stuff up.
[01:12:20.641 --> 01:12:22.162]  We led the IRA.
[01:12:22.162 --> 01:12:24.043]  The Irish below us didn't know it.
[01:12:24.043 --> 01:12:27.046]  We'd break their legs or kill them if they didn't bomb stuff.
[01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:42.756]  And we were doing the bombings to discredit the Irish, so we had an excuse to stay there, and then real Irish would get desperate because they didn't have any speech, and they'd try to get guns that we'd actually have shipped to them, then we'd ambush them and kill them.
[01:12:42.756 --> 01:12:48.518]  I'm not bashing the British on average themselves, but that's what the British government did, was literally lead the IRA.
[01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:53.080]  And so they're going to lead everybody into radicalization.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.060]  Our government's going to do it.
[01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:55.061]  The UK's going to do it.
[01:12:55.061 --> 01:12:56.041]  Germany's going to do it.
[01:12:56.041 --> 01:13:11.668]  They've got the German secret police leading the white supremacist groups that firebomb the Muslims and stuff, so that then no one has speech to say, I don't want to bring in 10 million more Muslims, because the German intelligence is firebombing the Muslims to make them look like victims.
[01:13:11.668 --> 01:13:11.888]  Paul?
[01:13:13.740 --> 01:13:14.240]  Precisely.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.082]  I mean, read the UN Migration Pact.
[01:13:16.082 --> 01:13:24.607]  It's about recategorising criticism of mass immigration as hate speech and then intimidating the populace when they try and speak out about it.
[01:13:24.607 --> 01:13:26.228]  Look at what's happening in New Zealand.
[01:13:26.228 --> 01:13:38.276]  Not only are they confiscating the weapons, they're literally sending political police around to people's private homes to interrogate populace and conservatives because they express their opinions on social media.
[01:13:38.696 --> 01:13:40.277]  So that's exactly what's happening.
[01:13:40.277 --> 01:13:49.439]  It's about de-platforming, it's about intimidation, fanning the flames of extremism to cause violence which benefits them.
[01:13:49.439 --> 01:13:50.479]  Paul's about to leave us.
[01:13:50.479 --> 01:13:56.261]  Ellen, you and I will be taking over, have plenty of time to talk and take calls and play clips and shift into some other facets of this.
[01:13:56.261 --> 01:13:57.902]  But do you have any questions for Paul?
[01:13:57.902 --> 01:14:03.683]  He's over there in the middle of this, lives in Spain part of the year, lives in the UK, reports for summit.news.
[01:14:03.683 --> 01:14:05.504]  Folks, check out his excellent website.
[01:14:05.504 --> 01:14:05.944]  Ellen?
[01:14:06.644 --> 01:14:19.514]  Yeah, Paul, I was just wondering if you agree with some other people I've talked to in the UK that say the feeling right now is different than past times when there have been votes that look like the Brexit may actually happen.
[01:14:19.514 --> 01:14:25.619]  Do you have more confidence today in a Brexit than you did, say, a month ago?
[01:14:25.619 --> 01:14:31.984]  Oh yeah, the mood in the UK in regards to Brexit, and especially a no-deal Brexit, by the way, which the odds have gone down for,
[01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:46.651]  Is way more positive than it was on March 31st because now Farage has created this pressure group which will pressure the Tories into electing a leader who will actually be able to carry off Brexit and get us out of the EU.
[01:14:46.651 --> 01:14:59.013]  So it's all about who's going to be the next Conservative leader but in terms of the position that we're in compared to three months ago with the meteoric rise of this party in just six weeks there's way more optimism about actually achieving Brexit.
[01:14:59.073 --> 01:15:00.394]  Paul, that's my last question.
[01:15:00.394 --> 01:15:02.536]  Farage is a trailblazer, an incredible leader.
[01:15:02.536 --> 01:15:05.858]  I know there's some infighting between Brexit group and UKIP.
[01:15:05.858 --> 01:15:07.380]  I think that should all end.
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:11.323]  He has leadership and charisma and history written all over him.
[01:15:11.323 --> 01:15:21.891]  I want to end up, if not this round, next round, seeing him become the Prime Minister of England and truly lead you guys out of the dark age and linking up with Trump, helping lead us out of it.
[01:15:21.891 --> 01:15:23.692]  We need him as a leader.
[01:15:23.692 --> 01:15:25.434]  England hasn't had a real leader in a long time.
[01:15:27.176 --> 01:15:28.937]  No, and the signs are pretty good.
[01:15:28.937 --> 01:15:34.341]  I mean, even in the national polls, in some of them, Farage's Brexit Party is beating the Conservative Party.
[01:15:34.341 --> 01:15:35.362]  That's a ruling party.
[01:15:35.362 --> 01:15:36.662]  That's absolutely massive.
[01:15:36.662 --> 01:15:39.004]  It's one or two points behind Labour.
[01:15:39.004 --> 01:15:47.049]  And most of these Conservative Party members who've switched to the Brexit Party for this election say they're not going to go back to the Tories.
[01:15:47.049 --> 01:15:54.434]  So, at the very least, he could end up in a coalition government and have that power like Salvini did in Italy with the Conservative Party.
[01:15:57.456 --> 01:15:58.957]  Oh, these pains.
[01:15:58.957 --> 01:16:01.497]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[01:16:01.497 --> 01:16:03.318]  I've got to get some relief.
[01:16:03.318 --> 01:16:08.999]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries, or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[01:16:08.999 --> 01:16:10.900]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.861]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?

[01:16:56.775 --> 01:17:03.120]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.162]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:17:06.162 --> 01:17:12.086]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:15.868]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:17:15.868 --> 01:17:17.149]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:18.490]  Who do we fight for?
[01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:24.675]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:17:24.675 --> 01:17:26.116]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:17:26.696 --> 01:17:29.337]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[01:17:29.337 --> 01:17:30.438]  Get back to nature.

[01:17:59.955 --> 01:18:01.461]  Okay, it's true.
[01:18:01.461 --> 01:18:02.645]  I stayed up late last night.
[01:18:58.087 --> 01:19:07.397]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.397 --> 01:19:10.259]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.259 --> 01:19:16.306]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:16.966 --> 01:19:23.230]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.230 --> 01:19:29.513]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.513 --> 01:19:36.558]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:36.558 --> 01:19:36.758]  But!
[01:19:37.598 --> 01:19:39.199]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:21:06.184 --> 01:21:08.565]  Alright folks, I'm back live here a little bit late.
[01:21:08.565 --> 01:21:23.871]  I was working on some breaking news during the break and as I was walking back into the studio live here, something really hit me that we have dropped the ball on that's beyond huge.
[01:21:23.871 --> 01:21:26.032]  It's everything.
[01:21:26.032 --> 01:21:29.973]  And next segment, I'm going to get into it.
[01:21:29.973 --> 01:21:31.114]  But it's one of those moments where
[01:21:32.617 --> 01:21:35.819]  God really touches you, and you feel it, and you know it.
[01:21:35.819 --> 01:21:37.119]  There's just a huge understanding.
[01:21:37.119 --> 01:21:39.681]  And so I'm going to talk about that next segment.
[01:21:39.681 --> 01:21:47.085]  But Owen, you've been sitting there patiently the last 45 minutes with Paul Watson on, chomping at the bit, making really great points.
[01:21:47.085 --> 01:21:52.568]  The historicness of what's happening, Trump saying treason charges, treason investigation, what we broke months ago.
[01:21:54.148 --> 01:21:57.229]  Again, this isn't a regular situation right now.
[01:21:57.229 --> 01:22:02.111]  This is a very special time, a very dangerous time, but our prayers are really being answered.
[01:22:02.111 --> 01:22:04.531]  People's actions are being answered.
[01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:09.233]  The Pope, who has acted like, you know, he's
[01:22:09.853 --> 01:22:27.557]  Auditioning to work for Satan or something, has come out against abortion, and said that Planned Parenthood has hit men who want to murder children, and destroy future generations, and he's even come out and said that if we don't have 2.1 kids for every two parents, there'll be nobody to take care of old people, and that civilization will collapse.
[01:22:27.557 --> 01:22:31.278]  He's suddenly making anti-globalist statements.
[01:22:31.278 --> 01:22:37.480]  George Soros is coming out saying China's the enemy, and is messing... I mean, they all understand they're losing.
[01:22:38.382 --> 01:22:39.583]  Again, it's not Catholics.
[01:22:39.583 --> 01:22:41.784]  The Pope's obviously a globalist operative.
[01:22:41.784 --> 01:22:44.425]  Soros is starting to backtrack in many ways.
[01:22:44.425 --> 01:22:49.088]  These are big signs that globalism is in deep, deep crap.
[01:22:49.088 --> 01:22:53.250]  So give us your overall ballpark in the next six minutes towards break about where you see this going.
[01:22:54.326 --> 01:23:01.210]  Well, you know how much they've invested to get to this point of the globalist agenda and the one world government.
[01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:04.231]  And so they can't just retract or lay down.
[01:23:04.231 --> 01:23:06.673]  They're going to have to do something to try to salvage this.
[01:23:06.673 --> 01:23:09.654]  Obviously, they see all the losses they're being dealt.
[01:23:09.654 --> 01:23:16.018]  But I think before 2020, the presidential election here in the United States, that's kind of their watermark.
[01:23:16.018 --> 01:23:17.699]  I mean, if Trump gets in again,
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:21.081]  And he brings down the deep state for treason.
[01:23:21.081 --> 01:23:22.542]  I mean, we know who he's talking about.
[01:23:22.542 --> 01:23:24.003]  It's Barack Obama.
[01:23:24.003 --> 01:23:25.804]  Barack Obama committed treason.
[01:23:25.804 --> 01:23:27.364]  And so that's bombshell stuff.
[01:23:27.364 --> 01:23:30.566]  You're talking about the last president of the United States.
[01:23:30.566 --> 01:23:33.868]  And so this is going to send shockwaves around the world.
[01:23:33.868 --> 01:23:36.169]  And I think that the Soroses are starting to feel it.
[01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:37.890]  I think that the Junkers are starting to feel it.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:51.801]  And so, there's going to be a trickle-down effect though, Alex, and it's going to be just the average leftist minion out there that, you know, look, I don't even want to go into the process of, like, insulting them or their intelligence or anything at this point, it's just like...
[01:23:52.944 --> 01:24:16.991]  You need to understand you're being used like a pawn in chess for a massive international criminal cabal and you're basically just like a little cancer form on society to go out there and infect the culture and pretend like there's some sort of resistance to patriots and Christianity in the West and all this stuff.
[01:24:16.991 --> 01:24:19.432]  It's all a big game of chess, Alex, as you know.
[01:24:20.632 --> 01:24:22.393]  I'm afraid that they're about to get even hot.
[01:24:22.393 --> 01:24:27.014]  I mean, we don't have to talk about my situation or stuff that you've dealt with, but this is what it's coming down to.
[01:24:27.014 --> 01:24:30.455]  No, no, let's get to your situation at the start of the next hour, because I want to get into this.
[01:24:30.455 --> 01:24:33.316]  Well, this is the second... Well, don't worry.
[01:24:33.316 --> 01:24:34.317]  I already know about it.
[01:24:34.317 --> 01:24:37.658]  We're going to put some major heat on their ass, legally and lawfully, see how they like it.
[01:24:38.126 --> 01:24:40.007]  This is the second time this has happened to me.
[01:24:40.007 --> 01:24:48.670]  And so, the new place I moved in, I went through multiple measures to make sure that, you know, if somebody was able to find this address or whatever, it wouldn't be linked to my name.
[01:24:48.670 --> 01:24:53.312]  Well, somehow they got it and they decided to post a bunch of flyers around town yesterday with my address.
[01:24:53.312 --> 01:24:55.834]  And to be honest with you, a bunch of people are saying, like, you know, you should be afraid.
[01:24:55.834 --> 01:24:56.214]  Honestly...
[01:24:57.353 --> 01:25:01.677]  I wouldn't even be here right now if it wasn't for God, so I have no fear.
[01:25:01.677 --> 01:25:03.759]  And that's not even me bragging, honestly.
[01:25:03.759 --> 01:25:07.523]  The way I behaved in some part of my life, I shouldn't even be here right now.
[01:25:07.523 --> 01:25:09.905]  So God had his hand on me, so I really believe that.
[01:25:09.905 --> 01:25:13.729]  But my point is, Alex, somebody is giving them this information.
[01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:18.033]  There's no way some leftist can just find my address.
[01:25:18.033 --> 01:25:21.976]  No, they have people like Reality Winner in the police departments, in the FBI.
[01:25:22.797 --> 01:25:24.399]  And that's it exactly.
[01:25:24.399 --> 01:25:27.182]  So who knows if it's Google?
[01:25:27.182 --> 01:25:28.203]  It can't be social media.
[01:25:28.203 --> 01:25:29.564]  I don't think any of them have my address.
[01:25:29.564 --> 01:25:32.067]  Who knows if it's like a credit card company?
[01:25:32.067 --> 01:25:33.088]  I don't believe it's my bank.
[01:25:33.088 --> 01:25:36.211]  I have a great relationship with my bank.
[01:25:36.211 --> 01:25:37.452]  So I don't even know where they're getting.
[01:25:37.452 --> 01:25:39.094]  But the point is people need to understand.
[01:25:41.457 --> 01:25:48.831]  If you're, a lot of people have already been hit with the censorship, a lot of people have already been hit with the Chase Bank, JPMorgan Chase, banning people, and there's other stuff.
[01:25:48.831 --> 01:25:53.440]  But you gotta know, next they come to your house, which doesn't intimidate us, it lets us know we're right about these people.
[01:25:54.645 --> 01:25:57.826]  And so, I just wish they would understand how they're being used.
[01:25:57.826 --> 01:25:58.727]  Like, it's the same thing.
[01:25:58.727 --> 01:26:00.607]  Like, how am I your enemy?
[01:26:00.607 --> 01:26:03.409]  What freedoms is InfoWars taken from you?
[01:26:03.409 --> 01:26:06.170]  What freedoms have Alex Jones ever taken from you?
[01:26:06.170 --> 01:26:09.211]  What has Alex Jones ever done to the American public?
[01:26:09.211 --> 01:26:15.834]  And they sit here, and they want to say, oh well, you're fake news, you're dangerous, you're a hate monger, and then they provide no quotes.
[01:26:15.834 --> 01:26:21.696]  Oh, the latest article in Atlantic Monthly, and there's a bunch of them, says that I'm an apex predator.
[01:26:21.696 --> 01:26:23.337]  No, the globalists are apex predators.
[01:26:24.266 --> 01:26:25.967]  And so that's the point exactly, Alex.
[01:26:25.967 --> 01:26:27.587]  You've never been in the government.
[01:26:27.587 --> 01:26:34.130]  You've never been in control of some multi-billion dollar corporation that ships all its manufacturing to China or who knows where else.
[01:26:34.130 --> 01:26:35.191]  That's not you.
[01:26:35.191 --> 01:26:36.791]  You've done everything here.
[01:26:36.791 --> 01:26:39.092]  People come up in Austin and they say they hate Alex Jones.
[01:26:39.092 --> 01:26:40.353]  I say, why?
[01:26:40.353 --> 01:26:43.294]  Alex Jones has brought millions of dollars to your economy.
[01:26:43.294 --> 01:26:48.696]  Alex Jones has brought people here that work hard and pay taxes and try to build the infrastructure here.
[01:26:48.696 --> 01:26:50.277]  What has Alex Jones done that's so bad?
[01:26:50.757 --> 01:26:52.158]  What is so bad about Alex Jones?
[01:26:52.158 --> 01:26:53.579]  Well, we don't like his message.
[01:26:53.579 --> 01:26:54.580]  Well, why don't you like his message?
[01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:55.160]  What does he say?
[01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:56.982]  And then they can't give a quote.
[01:26:56.982 --> 01:27:05.468]  So while here's like a plea to the left out there, if Antifa, whoever it is, if you guys get this message, this is a plea.
[01:27:05.468 --> 01:27:07.490]  You are being used.
[01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:14.295]  And if you go down this path, Alex, I saw a group of Antifa walking around Austin yesterday with their faces covered.
[01:27:14.295 --> 01:27:15.496]  They're like strung out or something.
[01:27:16.516 --> 01:27:21.238]  I'm telling you, if you go down this path, it doesn't end well for you.
[01:27:21.238 --> 01:27:23.259]  They want you to be killed.
[01:27:23.259 --> 01:27:24.879]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:27:24.879 --> 01:27:29.241]  You will be used as the Trojan horse to bring in... Well, I mean, let's just be honest.
[01:27:29.241 --> 01:27:31.722]  These people can't tie their shoelaces, and I'm not bragging, but...
[01:27:32.422 --> 01:27:38.247]  If I'm awake and focused, I can, with a handgun, at 50 yards shoot a pattern like that.
[01:27:38.247 --> 01:27:44.131]  We got guys working this office that I've seen at 50 yards can shoot through the same hole with a handgun.
[01:27:44.131 --> 01:27:49.595]  And I just feel sorry if people ever actually try something because it doesn't have us a win.
[01:27:49.595 --> 01:27:54.519]  If some methhead comes to my house and they pull a gun and I kill him with a riot shotgun with double-aught buck,
[01:27:55.319 --> 01:27:59.063]  I'm not going to feel good because that's just some zombie I had to put down.
[01:27:59.063 --> 01:28:04.648]  And that's what you're saying is, it's so sad that they're so brainwashed and they work for the literal Nazis.
[01:28:04.648 --> 01:28:13.758]  Juncker and Soros and the globalists, they work for the evil and they're just little weird meth heads that always wanted to be part of the power structure.
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:17.023]  And so now they think they scare people.
[01:28:17.023 --> 01:28:19.326]  But Owen, you probably don't know this.
[01:28:19.326 --> 01:28:26.455]  You probably don't know that some people saw when Antifa pointed guns at you a year and a half ago and threatened you and wouldn't let you in that public park.
[01:28:26.455 --> 01:28:31.601]  And I later just heard from a little bird that Antifa had a very bad day later.
[01:28:32.523 --> 01:28:37.107]  Well, and I'm actually amazed because I've had a lot of interactions with these people and they quit coming to my events.
[01:28:37.107 --> 01:28:39.489]  I mean, we had a big event yesterday at the Planned Parenthood.
[01:28:39.489 --> 01:28:44.353]  Over 200 people showed up and Antifa didn't show up except a couple people.
[01:28:44.353 --> 01:28:47.416]  Yeah, well, Chris Owen, I'm sad about it.
[01:28:47.416 --> 01:28:55.883]  I just heard from some very reputable people that a few people just got, they fell down and they broke bones.
[01:28:55.883 --> 01:28:56.444]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:57.799 --> 01:29:02.863]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:30:08.614 --> 01:30:09.574]  Thanks for calling, Tom.

[01:30:13.437 --> 01:30:19.361]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[01:30:19.361 --> 01:30:21.323]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:30:21.323 --> 01:30:22.283]  God bless you, brother.
[01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:25.826]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[01:30:25.826 --> 01:30:28.848]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that
[01:30:29.288 --> 01:30:30.369]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:30:30.369 --> 01:30:32.690]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:30:32.690 --> 01:30:35.452]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:30:59.904 --> 01:31:01.845]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:31:01.845 --> 01:31:02.666]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[01:31:02.666 --> 01:31:04.027]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:31:04.027 --> 01:31:05.548]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:31:05.548 --> 01:31:06.329]  I'm so excited.
[01:31:06.329 --> 01:31:07.249]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:31:07.249 --> 01:31:09.731]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:12.233]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:13.654]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:13.654 --> 01:31:15.095]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:15.095 --> 01:31:16.476]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:16.476 --> 01:31:17.737]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:17.737 --> 01:31:22.500]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:23.801]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:23.801 --> 01:31:25.342]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:25.342 --> 01:31:26.903]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:26.903 --> 01:31:27.624]  Like, good!
[01:31:27.984 --> 01:31:28.564]  Whoa!
[01:31:28.564 --> 01:31:30.286]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:30.286 --> 01:31:34.808]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride 3 toothpaste.
[01:31:34.808 --> 01:31:38.271]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[01:31:38.271 --> 01:31:40.292]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[01:31:40.292 --> 01:31:42.873]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[01:31:42.873 --> 01:31:43.614]  I'm thanking you.
[01:31:43.614 --> 01:31:50.058]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[01:31:50.058 --> 01:31:50.879]  It is next level.
[01:31:50.879 --> 01:31:51.459]  It really is good.
[01:31:51.459 --> 01:31:51.999]  So thank you.
[01:31:51.999 --> 01:31:53.940]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:54.321]  Thank you.

[01:33:01.815 --> 01:33:19.286]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.286 --> 01:33:24.529]  Live, raw, and unfiltered, it's The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:28.112 --> 01:33:43.245]  Well, what's happening with globalist candidates losing all over the world, the biggest victories yet, over a third of the seats in Europe in the EU Parliament won by anti-globalists that want to end the EU.
[01:33:43.245 --> 01:33:47.769]  That's despite all the media censorship, all the election fraud.
[01:33:47.769 --> 01:33:49.531]  It's huge.
[01:33:49.531 --> 01:33:55.656]  Because you understand that only a third in the EU Parliament of the 40 states that are in it
[01:33:57.003 --> 01:34:00.644]  Are up every two years.
[01:34:00.644 --> 01:34:05.165]  So there was only a third of the seats that were up.
[01:34:05.165 --> 01:34:09.226]  And most countries only had 10-15% Eurosceptics before.
[01:34:09.226 --> 01:34:12.827]  Now it's all over 30%.
[01:34:12.827 --> 01:34:18.168]  That means, in some countries, Eurosceptics got 70%.
[01:34:18.168 --> 01:34:21.149]  In countries like the UK, they got 35% or so.
[01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.429]  I mean,
[01:34:25.137 --> 01:34:27.779]  This spells defeat.
[01:34:27.779 --> 01:34:29.720]  Took two rounds.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:34.623]  The Nationalists, Anti-Globalists, have almost complete control of Italy now.
[01:34:34.623 --> 01:34:36.564]  Merkel's lost seven elections.
[01:34:36.564 --> 01:34:39.426]  By incredible fraud, she stayed in control.
[01:34:39.426 --> 01:34:41.767]  But her party gets like 10% of the vote now.
[01:34:41.767 --> 01:34:44.469]  Her party's dead.
[01:34:44.469 --> 01:34:47.111]  It's all on EuropeWars.com.
[01:34:47.111 --> 01:34:48.752]  It's all on NewsWars.com.
[01:34:48.752 --> 01:34:52.454]  We've got multiple reporters paid in Europe.
[01:34:54.275 --> 01:34:58.279]  We have multiple reporters paid in England.
[01:34:58.279 --> 01:35:00.340]  We have reporters here in the U.S.
[01:35:00.340 --> 01:35:08.948]  We are fighting hard thanks to your financial support and buying the products at MFORWARESTORE.COM and MFORWARESLIFE.COM.
[01:35:08.948 --> 01:35:12.471]  We have huge specials that are running right now at MFORWARESTORE.COM.
[01:35:12.471 --> 01:35:14.593]  Forty is the lowest sale.
[01:35:14.593 --> 01:35:16.014]  Sixty is the highest sale.
[01:35:17.011 --> 01:35:24.917]  We've never done some of these specials on things like bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, 95% curcuminoid.
[01:35:24.917 --> 01:35:26.959]  But I want you to experience how amazing it is.
[01:35:26.959 --> 01:35:34.605]  8-pack PowerStack, which is 13 capsules split into two different AM, PM packets you take, total full spectrum.
[01:35:34.605 --> 01:35:37.287]  It's 50% off out of the gates.
[01:35:37.287 --> 01:35:39.769]  X2, X3, 50% off.
[01:35:39.769 --> 01:35:46.134]  BrainForce Plus, it's all there at infowarestore.com, and that's how we finance this operation.
[01:35:47.995 --> 01:36:12.537]  But you know, even more important than the listeners, even more important than the AM and FM and TV affiliates, even more important than me or Owen Schroer or this incredible crew that does a kick-butt job and doesn't get enough credit from me, it comes down to God.
[01:36:12.537 --> 01:36:13.378]  We're on a planet
[01:36:14.574 --> 01:36:24.900]  In the middle of gorgeous space, way out on the edge of a little galaxy, and Hubble telescope has photographed 500 billion plus galaxies.
[01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:33.825]  And that's a 19, early 1990s telescope.
[01:36:33.825 --> 01:36:39.009]  They got new ones up there, they won't let us see what they're getting.
[01:36:39.009 --> 01:36:41.150]  I mean, we are little babies.
[01:36:42.776 --> 01:36:48.806]  But God told us 2,000 years ago there'll be a world government, there'll be a cashless system to buy and sell.
[01:36:48.806 --> 01:36:50.128]  It's only going to last a while.
[01:36:50.128 --> 01:36:51.049]  You've been given free will.
[01:36:52.389 --> 01:36:56.091]  I have to do this to you, but if you make the right choice, I'm waiting on the other side.
[01:36:56.091 --> 01:37:11.298]  I don't want to do this to you, but you've been given full consciousness as a little g. The only thing an omnipresent entity like God can do is create new creatures that have the seed of the universe in them and the potentiality to do anything.
[01:37:11.298 --> 01:37:12.298]  You have free will.
[01:37:12.298 --> 01:37:18.081]  You have a piece of God in you, a seed of the universe.
[01:37:21.223 --> 01:37:27.745]  God literally, as the Bible says, God loves a sparrow of the field so much when it dies, a little bird.
[01:37:27.745 --> 01:37:29.486]  Imagine how much God loves you.
[01:37:29.486 --> 01:37:34.228]  But God isn't creating robots.
[01:37:34.228 --> 01:37:40.650]  And God already created the angels and gave them free will and a bunch of them turned against him.
[01:37:40.650 --> 01:37:43.591]  One third.
[01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:48.913]  Imagine, we're dealing with God's malfunctioning, rebelling creation that was given free will.
[01:37:50.711 --> 01:37:52.393]  And what does Lucifer want to do?
[01:37:52.393 --> 01:37:55.155]  Lucifer is jealous as hell.
[01:37:55.155 --> 01:38:14.535]  Imagine you're a 40-year-old man, and you weigh maybe 100 pounds, and it's not bad if you're small, but you know what I mean, and you're a drug addict, and you're a child molester, and you're a criminal, and then you've got a little cousin who's super handsome and super smart, and you know he's going to get this big inheritance of a billion-dollar company,
[01:38:16.121 --> 01:38:17.942]  But he's three years old.
[01:38:17.942 --> 01:38:24.063]  If you could get control of him for a month or a year, you could convince him to jump into a well and die.
[01:38:24.063 --> 01:38:26.144]  You could convince him to play in traffic.
[01:38:26.144 --> 01:38:30.846]  All you want to do is kill him because he has the inheritance.
[01:38:30.846 --> 01:38:31.826]  He has the birthright.
[01:38:31.826 --> 01:38:32.986]  You don't have it.
[01:38:32.986 --> 01:38:34.367]  You're Lucifer.
[01:38:34.367 --> 01:38:35.627]  You're really old.
[01:38:35.627 --> 01:38:38.968]  A hundred billion, trillion years old?
[01:38:38.968 --> 01:38:40.669]  Who knows?
[01:38:40.669 --> 01:38:42.969]  God gave us the whole blueprint to beat him.
[01:38:42.969 --> 01:38:43.930]  God gave us a cheat sheet.
[01:38:43.930 --> 01:38:44.930]  Listen, I want you to join me.
[01:38:46.138 --> 01:38:49.882]  But I gotta do this to you, because it's free will.
[01:38:49.882 --> 01:38:51.324]  I don't want slaves.
[01:38:51.324 --> 01:38:53.406]  I could create robots or servants all day.
[01:38:53.406 --> 01:38:55.629]  I love you so much.
[01:38:55.629 --> 01:38:57.070]  I'm putting everything I have got into you.
[01:38:58.331 --> 01:39:04.374]  Just please, please, please listen to me and just don't do these things because it'll bring you down.
[01:39:04.374 --> 01:39:09.256]  I want to be with you and God cries for all of all of us that fall to the devil.
[01:39:09.256 --> 01:39:10.417]  This is real folks.
[01:39:10.417 --> 01:39:12.058]  This whole planet is a test.
[01:39:12.058 --> 01:39:14.479]  We're such a powerful weapon system.
[01:39:14.479 --> 01:39:19.201]  If we go bad, we're way out in the corner of the universe, not just in the galaxy.
[01:39:19.201 --> 01:39:21.822]  We're like been towed way out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:22.763]  We're the weapon folks.
[01:39:23.985 --> 01:39:28.328]  We're the... You think we're doing something now, man?
[01:39:28.328 --> 01:39:29.129]  What we already built?
[01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:31.891]  The devil can't build all this stuff.
[01:39:31.891 --> 01:39:36.495]  The devil tricks us to build it, but twist it for him.
[01:39:36.495 --> 01:39:38.376]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:39:38.376 --> 01:39:41.338]  Because we've got their number.
[01:39:41.338 --> 01:39:43.440]  So I was thinking, during the break before last,
[01:39:47.959 --> 01:39:54.724]  I went from one building to the next, I was hurrying back over here with some articles, and I stumbled over the door frame and fell on my face.
[01:39:54.724 --> 01:40:13.476]  And when I hit my face and sprung back up, I went, we're not thanking God for globalism under attack, globalism failing everywhere, humanity starting to reignite, and then we're bitching and complaining that it's not good enough, it's not fast enough, and Trump doesn't do everything we want.
[01:40:13.476 --> 01:40:15.177]  Well, what are you doing?
[01:40:15.177 --> 01:40:15.838]  What am I doing?
[01:40:17.398 --> 01:40:18.979]  But it hit me.
[01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:23.743]  If we seek God's face, if we repent, what's that verse that's out there hanging on the wall?
[01:40:23.743 --> 01:40:28.127]  That if we seek God's face, if we repent, that He'll come and He'll heal our land.
[01:40:28.127 --> 01:40:30.289]  And we're seeing the beginnings of that.
[01:40:30.289 --> 01:40:32.811]  We've got a long way to go.
[01:40:32.811 --> 01:40:35.774]  But we really should thank God for what's happening.
[01:40:35.774 --> 01:40:44.942]  And thank God for all the gifts and the gift of consciousness and the gift of God being willing to create His own children and put them, because I've got four children.
[01:40:46.175 --> 01:40:58.280]  And you have children, and you're putting them into the world, and they're going to live, they're going to die, they're going to be in car wrecks, and they're going to get cancer, hopefully not, or heart attacks, you know, but they're going to live, and their consciousness is real, and they've got a soul.
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:04.422]  So you put them into the world because you want to have the children, and you want to love them, and you hope they grow up right.
[01:41:04.422 --> 01:41:08.483]  Well, that's how it is with God, but a trillion times bigger.
[01:41:08.483 --> 01:41:09.364]  Infinity bigger.
[01:41:10.444 --> 01:41:13.466]  And God loves us way more than any of us love our children.
[01:41:13.466 --> 01:41:29.454]  Imagine loving your child a thousand times that, knowing that child's potential, being omnipresent, but turning them loose in a pack of hyena-like devils, because it's what you've got to do, because they deserve consciousness.
[01:41:29.454 --> 01:41:32.936]  And God's not going to intervene, other than touching our heart.
[01:41:33.769 --> 01:41:42.838]  and giving us the blueprint, but if we reject God and we climb up on top that devil, it's going to lead us right into hell.
[01:41:42.838 --> 01:41:49.624]  And so, we should all thank God in sending His Son, Jesus Christ, as an example to us all, because that's what this is all about.
[01:41:49.624 --> 01:41:52.928]  And the enemy hates it when we talk about Christ more than anything.
[01:41:54.005 --> 01:41:57.829]  And the persecution of Christians is more than any other group because it's real.
[01:41:57.829 --> 01:41:58.870]  It's a blueprint.
[01:41:58.870 --> 01:42:00.531]  What you're told in the Bible is real.
[01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:16.386]  Not their misinterpretations, not their twisting, but the reality that God created us on this planet out of his own nostrils, out of his own breath, out of his own DNA.
[01:42:16.386 --> 01:42:19.869]  But he would let his own rebellious servant
[01:42:23.052 --> 01:42:31.015]  Come against us to test us so that we would be good sons and daughters in the future.
[01:42:31.015 --> 01:42:42.440]  And then God has to sit there and watch billions of his sons and daughters fall to evil and be destroyed and be sucked in by these devils and taken into a black hole into a pit forever.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.181]  That's what God did for consciousness.
[01:42:45.181 --> 01:42:47.162]  That's what God did to make you.
[01:42:47.162 --> 01:42:50.604]  That's what God did to give you this incredible power!
[01:42:51.946 --> 01:42:54.277]  You think about that, now you know God.
[01:42:57.631 --> 01:43:08.696]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[01:43:08.696 --> 01:43:17.580]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:21.562]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[01:43:22.242 --> 01:43:28.725]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.

[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.844]  This is a digital, AI-enforced, gag order.
[01:44:09.844 --> 01:44:13.547]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[01:44:19.212 --> 01:44:20.932]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:44:20.932 --> 01:44:22.133]  This is racketeering.
[01:44:22.133 --> 01:44:23.253]  This is cartels.
[01:44:23.253 --> 01:44:25.674]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:44:25.674 --> 01:44:27.554]  We need it now.
[01:44:27.554 --> 01:44:29.234]  You can take on Big Ted.
[01:44:29.234 --> 01:44:38.197]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:44:38.197 --> 01:44:46.219]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:44:46.219 --> 01:44:47.079]  The way to fight back
[01:44:47.739 --> 01:44:52.563]  It's to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[01:44:52.563 --> 01:44:56.327]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.

[01:47:18.334 --> 01:47:39.443]  Well, you've got your diamonds And you've got your pretty clothes And the chauffeur drives your car You let everybody know But don't play with me Cause you're playing with fire
[01:47:44.356 --> 01:47:48.878]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:47:48.878 --> 01:47:55.382]  Alex Jones here with Owen Schroer.
[01:48:11.363 --> 01:48:20.732]  Now, when you heard my breakdown about God, and when I even try to go on air and talk about thanking God, I feel like I'm wearing dirty sackcloth, like the Bible talks about.
[01:48:20.732 --> 01:48:26.017]  The difference is, we know we're weak in front of God.
[01:48:26.017 --> 01:48:29.700]  The globalists feel that weakness, and so they reject God.
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:34.345]  And I just wanted to make the point that
[01:48:36.584 --> 01:48:39.225]  For every action there's an opposite and equal reaction.
[01:48:39.225 --> 01:48:42.246]  And really amazing things are happening to the globalists.
[01:48:42.246 --> 01:48:46.327]  And it's not about kissing Trump's ass because he's, quote, powerful.
[01:48:46.327 --> 01:48:49.267]  He was powerful for evil that I would oppose him.
[01:48:49.267 --> 01:48:51.208]  He's obviously doing good.
[01:48:51.208 --> 01:48:52.248]  The enemy hates him.
[01:48:52.248 --> 01:48:53.308]  It's not a fake attack.
[01:48:53.308 --> 01:48:54.169]  It's real.
[01:48:54.169 --> 01:48:55.709]  They're getting more hysterical by the moment.
[01:48:55.709 --> 01:48:56.709]  It's happening all over the world.
[01:48:56.709 --> 01:48:59.710]  It's not just Trump.
[01:48:59.710 --> 01:49:02.931]  An example is how they had a CNN article I never got to yesterday I meant to cover.
[01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:08.646]  About something like CNN.com.
[01:49:08.646 --> 01:49:09.488]  The nightmare!
[01:49:10.287 --> 01:49:18.230]  It was even worse, like the hell, the dread, I forget the exact headline, I think he's about to pull it up, the dread, the nightmare of Air Force One.
[01:49:18.230 --> 01:49:24.473]  He sleeps four hours, he's reading policy reports, he's on the phone to world leaders and business leaders hyping up America.
[01:49:24.473 --> 01:49:27.574]  He doesn't sleep, he reads hundreds of newspapers.
[01:49:27.574 --> 01:49:28.995]  It's insane.
[01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:34.898]  And he'll go to more countries than anybody else, just like he would go like eight places in one day on the election.
[01:49:34.898 --> 01:49:38.039]  There it is, inside Trump's Air Force One, it's like being held captive.
[01:49:39.701 --> 01:49:47.190]  And the article goes on to say, but wait, I thought he lays around all day and doesn't work at the White House or anywhere else.
[01:49:47.190 --> 01:49:49.213]  I thought he didn't want to be the president.
[01:49:49.213 --> 01:49:51.716]  Again, they think we don't have memories.
[01:49:51.716 --> 01:49:54.520]  It's not about kissing Trump's ass.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.142]  It's about kissing the truth's butt.
[01:49:57.742 --> 01:49:59.503]  Just like they say things about us.
[01:49:59.503 --> 01:50:04.466]  It doesn't get to me that they have NPR specials every week lying about me.
[01:50:04.466 --> 01:50:06.407]  It's that none of it's true.
[01:50:06.407 --> 01:50:08.308]  There's some real stuff I've done in my life.
[01:50:08.308 --> 01:50:11.330]  I would tell people I'm not perfect.
[01:50:11.330 --> 01:50:15.612]  They'll have an NPR special about me admitting I financed abortions.
[01:50:15.612 --> 01:50:20.815]  And that I am ashamed of it to this day, even though I believed the hype back when I was a teenager.
[01:50:20.815 --> 01:50:22.476]  I've said my sins.
[01:50:22.476 --> 01:50:23.516]  I'm not proud of them.
[01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:26.378]  I'm not an arrogant, puffed up person how good I am.
[01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:38.676]  But to be accused of things I've never done, it's how they create this whole tissue of lies, whole tapestries of things I never said, I never did.
[01:50:38.676 --> 01:50:40.037]  It's all lies.
[01:50:40.037 --> 01:50:42.319]  And they know they're lying.
[01:50:42.319 --> 01:50:47.123]  And that's how they create the false histories to destroy us and lay traps for us.
[01:50:47.123 --> 01:50:52.747]  And to watch these demonic hunchbacks get away with it over and over again makes me sick.
[01:50:52.747 --> 01:50:55.930]  But again, it doesn't matter because they're fighting so hard
[01:50:57.125 --> 01:51:06.867]  Oh, and because they know their time is short, they know the sun is setting on them, they know the book of life is closing on them, they know that a new world is about to be formed.
[01:51:06.867 --> 01:51:11.388]  That's why they launched their fake New Age, because God is the real New Age.
[01:51:11.388 --> 01:51:16.669]  They are the counterfeit of the new system that's coming.
[01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:24.151]  And they're very, very, very afraid, because it's not the fake Bible-thumper view that the universe really is.
[01:51:25.965 --> 01:51:30.358]  It's interfacing with omnipresence and they can't do it.
[01:51:30.358 --> 01:51:31.201]  They're broken.
[01:51:31.201 --> 01:51:32.324]  Where do you think this goes, Ellen?
[01:51:33.424 --> 01:51:50.713]  Well, we used the three-dimensional test, we called it the Trump test, and it was kind of just a demarcation line to say who in media is legit, who's a sellout, who in the government's legit, who's a sellout, and it was just kind of a basic Trump test.
[01:51:50.713 --> 01:51:53.155]  I mean, are you going to be honest about Trump or are you going to lie about Trump?
[01:51:53.155 --> 01:51:57.217]  That doesn't mean you have to agree with everything Trump does or says, it just means are you going to go with the
[01:51:57.657 --> 01:52:02.202]  False narrative that he's a racist, you know, Nazi, whatever other BS they put out there.
[01:52:02.202 --> 01:52:06.666]  Or are you going to be fair in the coverage and say, no, Trump is, you know, here's what he's doing.
[01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:12.532]  But you see a story like that from CNN and it really doesn't surprise me that CNN would put that out because.
[01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:21.720]  My guess is you have somebody, maybe CNN, get some media member on board Air Force One for a stint or something just to write that story.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:24.602]  And yeah, they probably don't work that hard.
[01:52:24.602 --> 01:52:26.104]  You know, it's not easy to work here.
[01:52:26.104 --> 01:52:28.526]  I bet it's not easy to work for Donald Trump.
[01:52:28.526 --> 01:52:29.787]  In fact, I bet it's really hard.
[01:52:30.327 --> 01:52:32.368]  And so maybe some people can't handle it.
[01:52:32.368 --> 01:52:34.790]  And so if you can't handle it, then you know what?
[01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:35.491]  Maybe you can't handle it.
[01:52:35.491 --> 01:52:38.653]  And that's why a lot of people come and go from this White House administration.
[01:52:38.653 --> 01:52:51.221]  But to sit here and act like there aren't people that work every day for Donald Trump that aren't humbled and honored and just feel the privilege of that ability to change the world with this man right now.
[01:52:51.221 --> 01:52:55.124]  I mean, I'm not surprised at seeing one to be totally out of touch with that reality.
[01:52:55.124 --> 01:52:58.006]  Well, that's my point is that they're saying he's a lazy ass.
[01:52:58.706 --> 01:53:02.027]  He doesn't want to be president, but everything else shows the opposite.
[01:53:02.027 --> 01:53:09.990]  They write an article about the feverish trips that no one does, two countries a day, he's not sleeping, he's a maniac.
[01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.810]  So which is it?
[01:53:10.810 --> 01:53:17.432]  All I'm saying is they insult us as if we can't remember this, as if we can't differentiate.
[01:53:17.432 --> 01:53:18.513]  But let's bring it back to
[01:53:19.824 --> 01:53:29.149]  The four-dimensional, nine-dimensional God model, which is, when we go out and do these events, Alex, you can actually see demons come out of these people.
[01:53:29.149 --> 01:53:31.070]  It's not fun to watch.
[01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:34.891]  I mean, you really wonder what is going through... Let's talk about that.
[01:53:34.891 --> 01:53:39.714]  You went out to do a pro-life demonstration yesterday, and we have new videos.
[01:53:39.714 --> 01:53:41.194]  We have a new video that we aired Sunday.
[01:53:41.194 --> 01:53:41.715]  We're going to cue it up.
[01:53:42.395 --> 01:53:46.038]  Because the other day I said, this is the woman saying kill babies up to age 3.
[01:53:46.038 --> 01:53:48.280]  Then the woman just said kill babies anytime.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:53.685]  No, we had another video, the woman says kill babies up to age 3, which is actually what they teach at universities now.
[01:53:53.685 --> 01:53:55.186]  You're not a human until age 3.
[01:53:55.186 --> 01:53:56.147]  It's bioethics.
[01:53:56.147 --> 01:53:58.128]  Then it's age 10, then it's age 70.
[01:53:58.128 --> 01:53:59.690]  Get rid of old, get rid of young.
[01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:00.931]  We have that clip.
[01:54:00.931 --> 01:54:02.812]  Let's find that for next hour.
[01:54:02.812 --> 01:54:05.715]  But exactly, tell folks what it's like to face these people.
[01:54:06.874 --> 01:54:10.597]  Well, here in Austin, like I said, they quit coming to my events for some reason.
[01:54:10.597 --> 01:54:17.302]  I think that's because I kind of schooled Antifa a couple times and then just got real with them on a one-on-one level, and so they just quit bothering with me.
[01:54:17.302 --> 01:54:18.783]  But there were a couple that made it out.
[01:54:18.783 --> 01:54:21.105]  We were just outside of Planned Parenthood yesterday.
[01:54:21.105 --> 01:54:22.626]  You know, there's some good news in Texas.
[01:54:22.626 --> 01:54:23.627]  We got two bills.
[01:54:23.627 --> 01:54:24.848]  Senate Bill 22.
[01:54:24.848 --> 01:54:27.450]  I think it's the right to protect life bill.
[01:54:27.450 --> 01:54:34.015]  If there's a baby that's born, you know, a failed abortion, the bills on the governor's desk will probably be signed.
[01:54:34.015 --> 01:54:36.757]  The law now will state that you cannot abort that baby.
[01:54:37.057 --> 01:54:42.139]  So already born baby ain't gonna get caught up with seven pounds of meat?
[01:54:42.139 --> 01:54:44.260]  Yeah, hopefully we're not going to be doing that here in Texas.
[01:54:44.260 --> 01:54:47.962]  And then there's another bill that says any institution that...
[01:54:49.079 --> 01:54:49.259]  Does
[01:55:09.743 --> 01:55:14.146]  Uh, obviously there was some guy that was publishing flyers around town with my address trying to dox me.
[01:55:14.146 --> 01:55:19.109]  Uh, there were a couple people that showed up on the road to flick us off, threw things at us.
[01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:21.091]  A guy, you know, almost got off his motorcycle.
[01:55:21.091 --> 01:55:21.771]  He was screaming at us.
[01:55:21.771 --> 01:55:25.714]  And then there was one guy who I guess was the only Antifa that showed up.
[01:55:25.714 --> 01:55:30.617]  It's funny, he shows up in a ski mask because I guess he's afraid that we're going to throw acid on his eyes when that's what they do.
[01:55:32.438 --> 01:55:52.543]  He's actually having a fair conversation with our reporter, Savannah Hernandez, who had a neutral mic flag, and so they're just talking, and so I just go over, I'm not even talking, and I just put the Infowars mic out there just to get the conversation, and all of a sudden he gets upset and wants to quit talking to me, and then when he finds out Savannah works here too, he decides he's gonna leave, and this is like a 40-year-old man
[01:55:53.323 --> 01:55:56.407]  On his way out, I used to do this when I was like nine, Alex.
[01:55:56.407 --> 01:55:58.931]  Like I was a little prankster when I was nine in the schoolyard.
[01:55:58.931 --> 01:56:05.379]  40 year old man walks away and lights off three stink bombs on his way out.
[01:56:05.379 --> 01:56:09.585]  Now you remember, me and you were out there one time when you were bullhorning that event that was in town.
[01:56:09.585 --> 01:56:09.905]  I think it was...
[01:56:10.706 --> 01:56:12.727]  It was named Donald Trump and Alex Jones Fake News.
[01:56:12.727 --> 01:56:16.067]  They shut down town, shut down Congress, and they wouldn't even let me in the event.
[01:56:16.067 --> 01:56:17.128]  It was about me.
[01:56:17.128 --> 01:56:20.808]  Yeah, they tried to hit me and they hit you with a bag of feces.
[01:56:20.808 --> 01:56:25.590]  Literally, the guy drives by on his bike, and who knows what it was he threw out there.
[01:56:25.590 --> 01:56:29.571]  Well, and if I'd mentioned it, they take bags of urine and feces and rot them.
[01:56:29.571 --> 01:56:30.831]  And that's what you got hit with.
[01:56:30.831 --> 01:56:39.373]  To get back to what you were talking about in the last segment, Alex, it's like, I don't even know how to explain it, because I mean, honestly, it's a humbling thing, and it doesn't come off that way, but it's like,
[01:56:41.718 --> 01:56:46.863]  God always chose you, but you have to choose God.
[01:56:46.863 --> 01:56:51.747]  And so if you don't choose God, then you're never going to be on the right path.
[01:56:51.747 --> 01:56:53.328]  You're never going to fulfill your destiny.
[01:56:53.328 --> 01:56:59.173]  You're never going to go down whatever your fate was designed to be by God.
[01:56:59.173 --> 01:57:02.276]  You're going to go down the left-hand path, the devil's path.
[01:57:02.276 --> 01:57:03.056]  And so it's like,
[01:57:03.897 --> 01:57:05.598]  I mean, I don't even feel like I want to go.
[01:57:05.598 --> 01:57:07.380]  I'm not even trying to bring demons out.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:09.341]  I'm not even trying to expose the devil.
[01:57:09.341 --> 01:57:13.785]  I'm just trying to do political activism and support my country and my president.
[01:57:13.785 --> 01:57:16.407]  And all I do is run into these demons everywhere I go.
[01:57:16.407 --> 01:57:19.630]  And that's the crazy thing is once you realize there's left hand and right hand path.
[01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:22.591]  Power, money, nothing means anything anymore.
[01:57:22.591 --> 01:57:28.614]  Once you know it's all spiritual, this is only level one, they're like, just, I want to go with God, let me on that.
[01:57:28.614 --> 01:57:30.034]  It's like, nothing matters.
[01:57:30.034 --> 01:57:31.375]  There's no more fear anymore.
[01:57:31.375 --> 01:57:32.635]  No more fear of a bullet.
[01:57:32.635 --> 01:57:33.996]  No more fear of an audit.
[01:57:33.996 --> 01:57:37.397]  No more fear of death, except you want to keep fighting in the mission.
[01:57:37.397 --> 01:57:40.199]  That's the only fear you have is being taken out of the game.
[01:57:40.199 --> 01:57:41.439]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:57:41.439 --> 01:57:45.481]  God works in mysterious waves, and as I've told them, we're only the latest wave.
[01:57:47.324 --> 01:57:50.348]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[01:57:50.348 --> 01:57:52.932]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[01:57:52.932 --> 01:57:55.715]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[01:57:55.715 --> 01:57:57.698]  And the globalists are so upset.
[01:57:57.698 --> 01:58:00.542]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[01:58:01.775 --> 01:58:06.839]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[01:58:06.839 --> 01:58:07.800]  So we looked at that.
[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:09.441]  We made the very best a.m.
[01:58:09.441 --> 01:58:09.862]  and p.m.

[01:58:48.348 --> 01:58:51.951]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:58:51.951 --> 01:58:53.713]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:58:53.713 --> 01:59:04.982]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:59:05.763 --> 01:59:14.952]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:59:14.952 --> 01:59:20.737]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:59:20.737 --> 01:59:26.022]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:59:26.022 --> 01:59:28.264]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:59:28.604 --> 01:59:30.326]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:59:30.326 --> 01:59:40.334]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:59:40.334 --> 01:59:42.976]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[01:59:42.976 --> 01:59:51.303]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:59:51.303 --> 01:59:53.966]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:16.764 --> 02:00:34.412]  You know, they were just asking me on this live, Monday, Memorial Day broadcast, what do we call the last two segments?
[02:00:34.412 --> 02:00:39.095]  And that stuff, we talk about it so heavy, it's so real, I don't know a headline.
[02:00:39.095 --> 02:00:40.976]  You know, God's the ultimate weapon against evil?
[02:00:40.976 --> 02:00:44.918]  I mean, um, how I found God in the fight against the globalists?
[02:00:46.519 --> 02:00:48.700]  You get into this and it really is good versus evil.
[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:56.084]  Like everybody said before us, when you grew up and you were a kid and the media makes fun of you, you're like, oh, the old-timers, good and evil, the devil.
[02:00:56.084 --> 02:01:03.907]  There are people that will go out of their way all day to do something bad to the innocent than to do something good for the innocent that helps them.
[02:01:03.907 --> 02:01:07.129]  Because spiritually, they're signed on to it.
[02:01:07.129 --> 02:01:08.209]  I want to get into politics.
[02:01:08.209 --> 02:01:10.030]  I want to get Dan Lyman on with us.
[02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:13.692]  Next segment from Europe with the huge developments there.
[02:01:15.302 --> 02:01:17.603]  When it comes down to it, I've been there with you, Ellen.
[02:01:17.603 --> 02:01:19.524]  You've been there with me.
[02:01:19.524 --> 02:01:22.066]  People see the videos online.
[02:01:22.066 --> 02:01:32.971]  We don't go out to a university or an abortion clinic and then see a bunch of weird zombies saying, I love Satan, who aren't like trying to freak us out.
[02:01:32.971 --> 02:01:36.133]  This is their operating system.
[02:01:36.133 --> 02:01:38.294]  And talking about how much they love to kill kids and stuff.
[02:01:38.294 --> 02:01:41.196]  We're going to play a clip of it in a moment.
[02:01:43.001 --> 02:01:49.245]  They all, like, their shoulders hang down, they're like zombies, they can hardly talk, their eyes roll back on their heads.
[02:01:49.245 --> 02:02:00.413]  There's some type of operating spirit or system that's been downloaded into them, and they're gone, and you can't seem to get to them and you want to save them.
[02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:04.096]  So we don't take pleasure in the fact that they're, quote, libtards.
[02:02:05.063 --> 02:02:06.784]  They're infested by something.
[02:02:06.784 --> 02:02:08.384]  What do you think it is, Alan?
[02:02:08.384 --> 02:02:20.369]  Well, I think there's a distinction between, because there's, you know, obviously Democrat voters or liberals out there, but there's a clear distinction between those that have consciously given over their soul to evil.
[02:02:20.369 --> 02:02:21.829]  And you can see the difference.
[02:02:21.829 --> 02:02:24.130]  They don't want to exist.
[02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:31.013]  And by the way, more and more Democrats, to interrupt, I've got to say this, used to as a small percentage of Democrat leaders were like demons.
[02:02:31.013 --> 02:02:34.034]  They're converting, most of their people are converting to it now.
[02:02:35.282 --> 02:02:37.843]  Well, look, there's signs all around us, too.
[02:02:37.843 --> 02:02:45.185]  I mean, just look at, you know, we don't celebrate, you know, these people getting ill, if that's the case, but just look at Nancy Pelosi.
[02:02:45.185 --> 02:02:49.386]  She can't even get through a press conference without stammering like a drunken fool.
[02:02:49.386 --> 02:02:50.407]  Look at Jerry Nadler.
[02:02:50.407 --> 02:02:52.027]  The guy literally passes out.
[02:02:52.027 --> 02:02:55.348]  It looked like he was having a stroke or something in the middle of a press conference.
[02:02:55.348 --> 02:03:00.270]  So, it's just like in the 2016, Hillary Clinton coughing through debates.
[02:03:00.270 --> 02:03:02.050]  Hillary Clinton falling downstairs.
[02:03:02.050 --> 02:03:04.811]  And he looks like a little rumpelstiltskin demon.
[02:03:06.604 --> 02:03:19.431]  So the signs are all around us, but if you've consciously given yourself over to evil, if you've consciously rejected your creator, then yeah, you have downloaded, the devil has successfully downloaded into your soul.
[02:03:19.431 --> 02:03:22.793]  I mean, there's famous interviews out there.
[02:03:22.793 --> 02:03:27.335]  I mean, the most recent one I can remember would be like a Katy Perry, but there's all kinds of it.
[02:03:27.335 --> 02:03:30.737]  They talk about, yeah, I had to sell my soul to the devil to be successful.
[02:03:30.737 --> 02:03:32.398]  Katy Perry was a famous Christian singer.
[02:03:33.266 --> 02:03:34.286]  Nobody knew of her.
[02:03:34.286 --> 02:03:35.307]  She wanted to be famous.
[02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:36.307]  She wanted to be rich.
[02:03:36.307 --> 02:03:38.948]  She wanted to be on the top album charts.
[02:03:38.948 --> 02:03:40.488]  So she said she sold her soul.
[02:03:40.488 --> 02:03:42.409]  I've had her father on.
[02:03:42.409 --> 02:03:43.809]  Dave Mustaine got him on.
[02:03:43.809 --> 02:03:46.130]  I can't tell you the behind the scenes stuff they told me.
[02:03:46.130 --> 02:03:47.690]  He admitted some of it on air.
[02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:51.852]  No, she literally did that with the devil for power.
[02:03:51.852 --> 02:03:53.032]  And people go to Hollywood.
[02:03:53.032 --> 02:03:54.573]  Mark Dice got called in a room.
[02:03:54.573 --> 02:03:56.453]  I was called in a room too, but I promise I'll talk about it.
[02:03:56.453 --> 02:03:57.754]  It's off record, so I won't.
[02:03:57.754 --> 02:04:01.335]  But they told Mark Dice, will you worship Satan for this TV show?
[02:04:01.335 --> 02:04:01.835]  And he said no.
[02:04:02.495 --> 02:04:03.718]  And it wasn't a joke, it's real!
[02:04:03.718 --> 02:04:12.435]  Well because they understand, once you have laid your guard down, once you've consciously accepted that...
[02:04:13.399 --> 02:04:14.100]  Then you're out.
[02:04:14.100 --> 02:04:14.760]  I mean, that's it.
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:15.781]  You have sold your soul.
[02:04:15.781 --> 02:04:30.432]  I mean, the Bible says that there's always forgiveness, there's always redemption, so perhaps there always is, but if you've consciously neglected the Creator, and you've decided to go against natural... Then that's the ultimate sin.
[02:04:30.432 --> 02:04:33.915]  The Holy Spirit comes, you reject it, you say, I choose Satan for power.
[02:04:34.215 --> 02:04:45.259]  And then you look like a green goblin, your face is green, you scream at the sky, and you can't accept the reality for what it is, and whatever the devil wants you to be, a tool for him, that's what you'll be.
[02:04:45.259 --> 02:04:54.062]  And you think you're in power because of the false paradigm you're in, the dream, the hoax, the spell, but you just run around howling at the sky, pooping on yourself.
[02:04:56.249 --> 02:05:01.451]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.451 --> 02:05:10.035]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:10.035 --> 02:05:13.017]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:13.017 --> 02:05:14.757]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.757 --> 02:05:21.020]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:05:23.121 --> 02:05:28.443]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[02:05:28.443 --> 02:05:31.405]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.405 --> 02:05:35.326]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:35.326 --> 02:05:39.308]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.308 --> 02:05:41.129]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:41.129 --> 02:05:47.231]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:47.231 --> 02:05:48.072]  Don't live
[02:05:48.912 --> 02:05:52.956]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[02:05:52.956 --> 02:06:07.167]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:07.167 --> 02:06:13.353]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:19.875 --> 02:06:21.856]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:06:21.856 --> 02:06:22.616]  to 3 p.m.
[02:06:22.616 --> 02:06:23.356]  I'm here live.
[02:06:23.356 --> 02:06:27.397]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:27.397 --> 02:06:27.517]  May 27, 2019.
[02:06:27.517 --> 02:06:32.119]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:32.119 --> 02:06:35.480]  Owen Schroyer is riding shotgun with me.
[02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:38.161]  Jon Papert hosts the 4th Hour.
[02:06:38.161 --> 02:06:45.343]  We've got Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com about to give us his expert take on what just unfolded, a major rout
[02:06:46.866 --> 02:06:51.548]  For the forces of world government, a time to thank God for what's unfolding.
[02:06:51.548 --> 02:06:58.792]  But Owen, putting bookends on what we covered the last three segments, this is footage of Caitlin Bennett in Austin.
[02:06:58.792 --> 02:07:01.013]  You were there as well with Millie Weaver a few days ago.
[02:07:01.013 --> 02:07:06.476]  We've got a bunch of footage saying kill children, get rid of them, kill them up to age three.
[02:07:06.476 --> 02:07:08.337]  That's Dr. Peter Singer.
[02:07:08.337 --> 02:07:11.859]  That's actually the eugenics bioethics boards that I learned about
[02:07:13.177 --> 02:07:17.499]  Eighteen years ago, the next phase would be kill kids up to age three.
[02:07:17.499 --> 02:07:30.904]  I've been saying this hundreds of times on air the last few months, since the governor of Virginia, who's a medical doctor, said, we have to, they ball, we keep them comfortable, we take the org, you know, with little blood balls.
[02:07:30.904 --> 02:07:34.166]  And so the fact that they're now rolling out the next phase is incredible.
[02:07:34.166 --> 02:07:34.746]  Here's that clip.
[02:07:36.055 --> 02:07:37.416]  It's not about the heartbeat.
[02:07:37.416 --> 02:07:39.577]  It's about the mama.
[02:07:39.577 --> 02:07:41.158]  It's about the mother's choice.
[02:07:41.158 --> 02:07:42.719]  So when do we cut off abortions?
[02:07:42.719 --> 02:07:43.799]  At what week?
[02:07:43.799 --> 02:07:46.460]  I think at three years old is when we should.
[02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:50.122]  You think at three years old is when we should stop aborting children?
[02:07:50.122 --> 02:07:52.023]  Yeah.
[02:07:52.023 --> 02:07:53.484]  Okay, convince me of that.
[02:07:53.484 --> 02:07:57.366]  Give me an argument for that.
[02:07:57.366 --> 02:07:58.807]  I need a moment.
[02:07:58.807 --> 02:08:00.428]  This is too much.
[02:08:02.803 --> 02:08:09.125]  You know, a lot of countries have a lot different views on life and when life begins.
[02:08:09.125 --> 02:08:10.245]  When does life begin for you?
[02:08:10.245 --> 02:08:12.906]  I don't know.
[02:08:12.906 --> 02:08:15.547]  Are we even really alive?
[02:08:15.547 --> 02:08:18.668]  So you said that up to three years old.
[02:08:18.668 --> 02:08:19.708]  Convince me of that.
[02:08:19.708 --> 02:08:24.490]  What is your premise for saying that we can kill babies, children, toddlers until they're three?
[02:08:24.490 --> 02:08:29.351]  What happens at three years old to where we can't abort them anymore?
[02:08:29.351 --> 02:08:30.812]  They start talking a lot.
[02:08:32.179 --> 02:08:33.940]  Why are you trying to touch me?
[02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:37.661]  So this is almost the 57th time I've been touched without my consent.
[02:08:37.661 --> 02:08:39.022]  It's not you, it's the microphone.
[02:08:39.022 --> 02:08:39.662]  It's the microphone.
[02:08:39.662 --> 02:08:40.582]  Don't touch my property.
[02:08:40.582 --> 02:08:42.423]  You guys, see this is what's funny.
[02:08:42.423 --> 02:08:44.044]  You guys don't respect property rights.
[02:08:44.044 --> 02:08:47.225]  If you guys respected property rights in life, you wouldn't act like this.
[02:08:47.745 --> 02:08:48.566]  Because it's pro-human.
[02:09:10.185 --> 02:09:12.627]  So if you're a radio listener, you've been spared seeing her.
[02:09:12.627 --> 02:09:21.634]  Totally green skin, translucent white skin, zombie-like, hateful, obsessed with killing babies.
[02:09:21.634 --> 02:09:23.256]  When does life even begin?
[02:09:23.256 --> 02:09:25.097]  Because that's how a demon talks.
[02:09:25.097 --> 02:09:26.518]  You say, I want to defend life.
[02:09:26.518 --> 02:09:27.820]  There is no life.
[02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:30.041]  There is only death.
[02:09:30.041 --> 02:09:33.004]  And you don't know until you engage them.
[02:09:33.004 --> 02:09:35.886]  This is the average operating system.
[02:09:35.886 --> 02:09:38.789]  A soulless, shriveled woman who hates men,
[02:09:40.026 --> 02:09:42.987]  But she goes, the mama decides the death.
[02:09:42.987 --> 02:09:45.288]  Mama's kill, baby.
[02:09:45.288 --> 02:09:46.989]  Mama kill.
[02:09:46.989 --> 02:09:48.669]  Kali.
[02:09:48.669 --> 02:09:54.011]  But Alex, let's actually break this down because in that tiny little clip, there's so much to learn.
[02:09:54.011 --> 02:09:56.592]  First of all, she says, are we even alive?
[02:09:56.592 --> 02:09:59.533]  So she's right there telling you she's spiritually dead.
[02:09:59.533 --> 02:10:00.794]  I mean, that's it right there.
[02:10:00.794 --> 02:10:01.654]  She's gone.
[02:10:01.654 --> 02:10:03.575]  The devil has won her soul.
[02:10:03.575 --> 02:10:04.655]  And they all have that look.
[02:10:04.655 --> 02:10:06.116]  It's like looking through her.
[02:10:06.116 --> 02:10:06.876]  I'm going to get you.
[02:10:07.799 --> 02:10:11.700]  And then Caitlyn made the point about the InfoWars MyFlad being like a QR code.
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:13.721]  Again, she doesn't even realize how right she is.
[02:10:13.721 --> 02:10:15.101]  But it's spiritual.
[02:10:15.101 --> 02:10:16.081]  It's not digital.
[02:10:16.081 --> 02:10:17.462]  It's not three-dimensional.
[02:10:17.462 --> 02:10:18.722]  It's spiritual.
[02:10:18.722 --> 02:10:20.623]  It's what we do here that they hate.
[02:10:20.623 --> 02:10:23.103]  And then here's the other level, too.
[02:10:23.103 --> 02:10:25.244]  That poor girl, you know, she's young.
[02:10:25.244 --> 02:10:26.144]  Maybe there's hope for her.
[02:10:26.144 --> 02:10:27.425]  But what is really driving her?
[02:10:27.425 --> 02:10:29.165]  She was slowly seduced into this.
[02:10:29.165 --> 02:10:30.966]  But you notice what she does.
[02:10:30.966 --> 02:10:33.206]  She uses the brainwashing terms.
[02:10:33.206 --> 02:10:34.427]  Elizabeth Warren does it all the time.
[02:10:34.427 --> 02:10:34.887]  Mama.
[02:10:34.887 --> 02:10:35.567]  It's about the mama.
[02:10:37.288 --> 02:10:39.590]  A mama takes care of the baby.
[02:10:39.590 --> 02:10:42.052]  The mama don't kill the baby.
[02:10:42.052 --> 02:10:45.514]  The truth is Alex, these women just hate men for whatever reason.
[02:10:45.514 --> 02:10:47.736]  Maybe they've been treated badly by a man.
[02:10:47.736 --> 02:10:51.679]  Maybe it's the propaganda in the media that says men are bad, that they hate men.
[02:10:51.679 --> 02:10:55.542]  Or maybe they genuinely think men are out to control their bodies with abortion.
[02:10:55.542 --> 02:10:58.864]  I choose to stand for pro-life because it's an easy win.
[02:10:58.864 --> 02:11:01.646]  I mean, how do you not stand for innocent babies?
[02:11:01.646 --> 02:11:03.628]  How do you not stand for not murdering babies?
[02:11:03.628 --> 02:11:05.489]  I mean, that's like the easiest win you can take.
[02:11:06.630 --> 02:11:10.734]  The whole thing is, they, it's all, it's amazing, it's all in that one little clip.
[02:11:10.734 --> 02:11:15.257]  They're so spiritually blind, their whole cult, let's play it and we're gonna go to Dan Lyman.
[02:11:15.257 --> 02:11:22.323]  Here it is, and they're all like this, I mean we've got hours of footage, I kill babies, I love Satan.
[02:11:22.323 --> 02:11:23.544]  You think they're trying to shock you?
[02:11:23.544 --> 02:11:24.425]  No.
[02:11:24.425 --> 02:11:27.107]  Three years, that's Peter Singer, that's the plan.
[02:11:27.107 --> 02:11:28.829]  Now they've already got five states passed laws.
[02:11:30.655 --> 02:11:40.995]  If the doctors say we don't get government involved, the mama who's drugged up, and the daddy ain't bothered, we gonna get the little chicklin' out of the baby good.
[02:11:41.681 --> 02:11:43.723]  So, they've already gotten there.
[02:11:43.723 --> 02:11:46.426]  It's all about, we want to kill and we want to kill.
[02:11:46.426 --> 02:11:49.529]  It's the mama gonna do it.
[02:11:49.529 --> 02:11:54.614]  Once the kids start talking a lot, maybe we don't kill them now.
[02:11:54.614 --> 02:11:57.476]  Look how sick she is.
[02:11:57.476 --> 02:11:58.698]  But she's all high.
[02:11:58.698 --> 02:12:00.880]  Only time she shows any energy, she starts talking about killing babies, she's like...
[02:12:01.809 --> 02:12:05.871]  Yeah, but hey, they start talking, and maybe we don't then.
[02:12:05.871 --> 02:12:09.392]  But once we get you to Accept of Days 3, then we'll get them after that.
[02:12:09.392 --> 02:12:12.214]  Ah, their dimensional gates open, give me their blood.
[02:12:12.214 --> 02:12:15.815]  Ah, and then she goes, uh, uh, uh, uh, ah!
[02:12:15.815 --> 02:12:17.696]  And it's like they're trying to come through.
[02:12:17.696 --> 02:12:20.377]  And that's the thing is, you don't believe in demons until you're around them.
[02:12:20.377 --> 02:12:21.318]  You're like, what's going on?
[02:12:21.318 --> 02:12:22.958]  Ah, your children are ours.
[02:12:22.958 --> 02:12:24.199]  Your planet's ours.
[02:12:24.199 --> 02:12:26.420]  I can tell you how many footage I see of mentally ill people.
[02:12:27.475 --> 02:12:33.077]  And schizos that come after Infowars, they'll be like, I just want to destroy your planet, destroy Alex Jones!
[02:12:33.077 --> 02:12:36.018]  It's like, what is this?
[02:12:36.018 --> 02:12:37.559]  Who are these people?
[02:12:37.559 --> 02:12:38.800]  I don't know!
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:40.800]  Because you don't want to kill babies!
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:43.201]  Because their whole plan is to kill the planet.
[02:12:43.201 --> 02:12:44.782]  It's why they're the environmentalists.
[02:12:44.782 --> 02:12:45.822]  They're the guardians.
[02:12:45.822 --> 02:12:49.324]  Cut the carbon dioxide off, it's a trace gas, the planet dies without it.
[02:12:49.884 --> 02:12:53.626]  And then GMO, toxic waste dumping, everything's fine.
[02:12:53.626 --> 02:12:54.547]  So let's play this woman.
[02:12:54.547 --> 02:12:56.267]  There's a full ten minute clip of her.
[02:12:56.267 --> 02:13:02.111]  Here she is saying, kill babies up to age three for mama.
[02:13:02.111 --> 02:13:06.473]  The demon even uses the word, mama kill baby, mama!
[02:13:06.473 --> 02:13:09.795]  She's like, your mother sucks cocks in hell, you know, to use the quote.
[02:13:10.595 --> 02:13:13.516]  Out of Exorcist, sorry for the French, but that's what she says.
[02:13:13.516 --> 02:13:15.637]  She's like, Mama kill!
[02:13:15.637 --> 02:13:16.858]  Mama kill!
[02:13:16.858 --> 02:13:18.178]  Mama kill, baby!
[02:13:18.178 --> 02:13:21.300]  That's what mother does is murder babies!
[02:13:21.300 --> 02:13:23.341]  Pure Satanism.
[02:13:23.341 --> 02:13:25.922]  You want to see pure Satanism, here it is.
[02:13:25.922 --> 02:13:27.463]  So when do we cut off abortions?
[02:13:27.463 --> 02:13:28.543]  At what week?
[02:13:28.543 --> 02:13:31.224]  I think at three years old is when we should, you know.
[02:13:31.224 --> 02:13:34.366]  You think at three years old is when we should stop aborting children?
[02:13:34.366 --> 02:13:36.767]  Yeah.
[02:13:36.767 --> 02:13:38.227]  Okay, convince me of that.
[02:13:38.227 --> 02:13:39.248]  Give me an argument for that.
[02:13:42.073 --> 02:13:43.534]  I need a moment.
[02:13:43.534 --> 02:13:47.537]  This is too much.
[02:13:47.537 --> 02:13:53.861]  You know, a lot of countries have a lot of different views on life and when life begins.
[02:13:53.861 --> 02:13:55.001]  When does life begin for you?
[02:13:55.001 --> 02:13:57.643]  I don't know.
[02:13:57.643 --> 02:14:00.285]  Are we even really alive?
[02:14:00.285 --> 02:14:02.006]  So you said that up to three years old.
[02:14:03.416 --> 02:14:04.458]  Convince me of that.
[02:14:04.458 --> 02:14:09.228]  What is your premise for saying that we can kill babies, children, toddlers, until they're three?
[02:14:09.228 --> 02:14:12.694]  What happens at three years old to where we can't abort them anymore?
[02:14:13.897 --> 02:14:16.339]  Um, they start talking a lot.
[02:14:16.339 --> 02:14:17.520]  Shut him up.
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:18.701]  Why are you trying to touch me?
[02:14:18.701 --> 02:14:22.404]  So this is almost the 57th time I've been touched without my consent.
[02:14:22.404 --> 02:14:23.745]  It's not you, it's the microphone.
[02:14:23.745 --> 02:14:24.426]  It's the microphone.
[02:14:24.426 --> 02:14:25.727]  Don't touch my property.
[02:14:25.727 --> 02:14:27.188]  You guys, see this is what's funny.
[02:14:27.188 --> 02:14:28.790]  You guys don't respect property rights.
[02:14:28.790 --> 02:14:33.614]  If you guys respected property rights in life, you wouldn't act like this.
[02:14:33.614 --> 02:14:36.576]  So she is like staring hardcore at the InfoWars logo.
[02:14:36.576 --> 02:14:38.378]  I am convinced that this logo...
[02:14:38.698 --> 02:14:44.822]  You go around them, they actually all go like... They don't all just have pale skin and dead eyes as a joke.
[02:14:44.822 --> 02:14:50.346]  Something's jacked into them, and it wants your babies.
[02:14:50.346 --> 02:14:51.407]  That's it, Alex.
[02:14:51.407 --> 02:14:53.168]  I mean, you've caught it on film.
[02:14:53.168 --> 02:14:54.188]  They say, kill the babies.
[02:14:54.188 --> 02:14:55.329]  They brag about their abortions.
[02:14:55.329 --> 02:14:57.251]  I've got it on film, bragging about their abortions.
[02:14:57.251 --> 02:14:59.872]  It's like, look, you had an abortion, okay?
[02:14:59.872 --> 02:15:01.213]  That's a sad thing.
[02:15:01.213 --> 02:15:03.114]  Why are you celebrating it?
[02:15:03.114 --> 02:15:06.637]  By the way, most of these women are so ugly and mentally ill, they never had an abortion.
[02:15:07.776 --> 02:15:17.061]  They just want to convince women, kill your babies, and let me be there and take you and help, because I get power, and the demon rewards me!
[02:15:17.061 --> 02:15:19.723]  Before they start talking, kill those little bastards!
[02:15:19.723 --> 02:15:20.143]  God!
[02:15:22.858 --> 02:15:23.419]  Well, give me that.
[02:15:23.419 --> 02:15:24.700]  That baby's a boy.
[02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:26.061]  That baby boy's gonna grow up.
[02:15:26.061 --> 02:15:28.023]  Well, get that baby!
[02:15:28.023 --> 02:15:31.787]  Unless we can make that baby boy into a female, that's gonna be a man!
[02:15:31.787 --> 02:15:36.853]  If we could chop his balls off, then maybe Satan would please us!
[02:15:36.853 --> 02:15:42.279]  We were not able to kill that little boy, give him vaccines, and chop his balls off for Satan!
[02:15:44.022 --> 02:15:45.144]  We're the good people!
[02:15:45.144 --> 02:15:47.949]  We're the liberals!
[02:15:47.949 --> 02:15:49.572]  We'll be right back!
[02:15:49.572 --> 02:15:52.297]  How dare us say we shouldn't kill three-year-old children.
[02:15:52.297 --> 02:15:53.960]  It's not liberal, it's racist.
[02:15:55.477 --> 02:15:56.738]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:56.738 --> 02:15:58.019]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:58.019 --> 02:16:01.761]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:01.761 --> 02:16:02.842]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:02.842 --> 02:16:04.683]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:04.683 --> 02:16:06.384]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:16:55.049 --> 02:16:56.270]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.270 --> 02:17:00.193]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.193 --> 02:17:01.735]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.735 --> 02:17:04.697]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.697 --> 02:17:10.262]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.262 --> 02:17:11.463]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.463 --> 02:17:14.405]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.405 --> 02:17:16.627]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:17:24.694 --> 02:17:26.575]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:17:26.575 --> 02:17:29.796]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:17:29.796 --> 02:17:31.397]  Savory and delicious.

[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:00.021]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:18:00.021 --> 02:18:00.902]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:18:00.902 --> 02:18:02.263]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:18:02.263 --> 02:18:03.784]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:18:03.784 --> 02:18:04.585]  I'm so excited.
[02:18:04.585 --> 02:18:05.486]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:18:05.486 --> 02:18:07.967]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:18:07.967 --> 02:18:10.469]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:18:10.469 --> 02:18:11.890]  The Bone Broth.

[02:18:14.492 --> 02:18:15.973]  The B-B-Bone Broth.
[02:18:15.973 --> 02:18:19.196]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake.
[02:18:19.196 --> 02:18:20.737]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:18:20.737 --> 02:18:22.038]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:22.038 --> 02:18:23.339]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:23.339 --> 02:18:25.140]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:25.881]  Like good.
[02:18:26.221 --> 02:18:26.801]  Whoa!
[02:18:26.801 --> 02:18:28.522]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:28.522 --> 02:18:32.704]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:18:32.704 --> 02:18:36.506]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:18:36.506 --> 02:18:38.528]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:18:38.528 --> 02:18:41.109]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products.
[02:18:41.109 --> 02:18:41.849]  I'm thanking you.
[02:18:41.849 --> 02:18:48.293]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:18:48.293 --> 02:18:49.033]  It is next level.
[02:18:49.033 --> 02:18:49.693]  It really is good.
[02:18:49.693 --> 02:18:50.234]  So thank you.
[02:18:50.234 --> 02:18:52.175]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:52.175 --> 02:18:52.535]  Thank you.

[02:19:59.267 --> 02:20:11.596]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:11.596 --> 02:20:19.341]  I'm no stranger to the rain.
[02:20:19.341 --> 02:20:24.604]  I'm a friend of thunder, friend as it is... Alright, I appreciate Dan Lyman holding.
[02:20:24.604 --> 02:20:27.266]  He'll be with us the rest of the hour while I was ranting.
[02:20:27.266 --> 02:20:28.287]  But I want to tell you something.
[02:20:31.404 --> 02:20:37.986]  The best thing I ever did was go out to pro-life rallies 20 years ago.
[02:20:37.986 --> 02:20:41.106]  20 plus years ago.
[02:20:41.106 --> 02:20:44.287]  I was guilty about paying for abortions.
[02:20:44.287 --> 02:20:45.667]  I didn't believe I'd have killed my kids.
[02:20:45.667 --> 02:20:47.328]  I believed the propaganda.
[02:20:47.328 --> 02:20:48.868]  I don't judge people that have that abortion.
[02:20:48.868 --> 02:20:51.089]  God judges the heart.
[02:20:51.089 --> 02:20:53.269]  People ask, like, why the hell would you admit that on air?
[02:20:53.269 --> 02:20:56.410]  Because he without sin cast the first stone.
[02:20:56.410 --> 02:20:57.390]  But I repent for it.
[02:20:58.479 --> 02:21:02.100]  And I said I'd never do that again, and I've got four children.
[02:21:02.100 --> 02:21:04.880]  They could tell me I had a Down Syndrome child.
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:06.841]  I'm gonna keep that child and love that child.
[02:21:06.841 --> 02:21:08.421]  I don't have a Down Syndrome child.
[02:21:08.421 --> 02:21:09.641]  I don't ask for that from God.
[02:21:09.641 --> 02:21:11.702]  I'm saying I would take care of that child.
[02:21:11.702 --> 02:21:15.743]  People say they're the most loving children you can imagine.
[02:21:15.743 --> 02:21:25.665]  But if you hadn't been out to a pro-abortion rally, I suggest you go to one.
[02:21:25.665 --> 02:21:26.805]  And I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[02:21:28.456 --> 02:21:31.038]  There's a lot of anti-white talk out there.
[02:21:31.038 --> 02:21:33.979]  A lot of racism towards white people.
[02:21:33.979 --> 02:21:36.281]  And it's meant to create division in this country, in this world.
[02:21:36.281 --> 02:21:43.285]  And I think white people are good folks on average and have done a lot of good things and contribute to society.
[02:21:43.285 --> 02:21:49.669]  But when you go out to one of these events, they're almost all white.
[02:21:49.669 --> 02:21:51.310]  And they're not just licking their lips when you're around.
[02:21:54.048 --> 02:21:59.592]  They love killing kids, and they love the power of chopping them up, and they're demons.
[02:21:59.592 --> 02:22:04.435]  And they're almost all white.
[02:22:04.435 --> 02:22:11.019]  And I don't even know why I'm making that point.
[02:22:11.019 --> 02:22:18.364]  It's just that something's going on here, and all I can do is scientifically observe what's happening.
[02:22:18.364 --> 02:22:19.985]  But you just saw a woman, if you tuned in,
[02:22:22.065 --> 02:22:29.970]  And we've got dozens of these videos just at the event saying, oh, kill kids after they're born, kill them anytime, kill old people, you know, case for killing granny, cover a Newsweek.
[02:22:29.970 --> 02:22:31.290]  And it's just, kill everybody!
[02:22:31.290 --> 02:22:41.076]  And it's always these weak, super white-skinned, chicken-necked, zombie-looking people telling you how much they want to kill kids!
[02:22:41.076 --> 02:22:43.998]  And they're always anti... they're just a scourge!
[02:22:43.998 --> 02:22:45.218]  They're bad people!
[02:22:45.218 --> 02:22:48.600]  And they're tuned into something evil, folks.
[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:51.162]  Because they don't have... I mean, these aren't the liberals of old.
[02:22:52.824 --> 02:22:57.430]  These are screwballs, and their sacrament is dead babies.
[02:22:57.430 --> 02:22:58.872]  Oh, you're going to ride shotgun the rest of the hour.
[02:22:58.872 --> 02:23:05.139]  I want to go to Dan Lyman at EuropeWars.com, the incredible job he does as our main reporter in England.
[02:23:05.139 --> 02:23:11.467]  Talk about the big victories against the globalists, but will you experience the radical Islam's evil that just loves death?
[02:23:12.233 --> 02:23:15.397]  And the left's allied with it, and they act demon-possessed.
[02:23:15.397 --> 02:23:16.739]  It really is a spirit.
[02:23:16.739 --> 02:23:18.662]  It's a chomping at the bit.
[02:23:18.662 --> 02:23:19.383]  Let me ask Dan Lyman.
[02:23:19.383 --> 02:23:21.185]  We'll get into the elections next segment.
[02:23:21.185 --> 02:23:22.667]  But Dan, you live in Europe.
[02:23:22.667 --> 02:23:24.429]  You've been all over it.
[02:23:24.429 --> 02:23:26.632]  Before you even worked for us, you were a big reporter.
[02:23:26.632 --> 02:23:27.594]  You've covered Davos.
[02:23:27.594 --> 02:23:28.014]  You name it.
[02:23:28.835 --> 02:23:31.116]  This is a whole other subject you didn't know you were getting on involved.
[02:23:31.116 --> 02:23:36.137]  We have all these videos of the average person at a pro-abortion rally now.
[02:23:36.137 --> 02:23:38.118]  Their operating system is Satanism.
[02:23:38.118 --> 02:23:46.881]  They have a new movie out called Hell Satan where they admit the Democratic Party's new move is to get people to register in the satanic party and you know it's their operating system and some of them make it tongue-in-cheek but
[02:23:47.421 --> 02:23:53.165]  They're converting to this, and you've got ISIS eating hearts and putting women in sex slavery and children.
[02:23:53.165 --> 02:23:59.589]  It just really does come back to good versus evil in my view, and I don't think the average person who hasn't been on the front lines has witnessed this.
[02:23:59.589 --> 02:24:00.529]  You've been on the front lines.
[02:24:00.529 --> 02:24:01.230]  This isn't scripted.
[02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:02.230]  I don't know what you're going to say.
[02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:04.392]  I don't even know your religious background.
[02:24:04.392 --> 02:24:06.293]  I know you're a great reporter.
[02:24:06.293 --> 02:24:07.834]  Met you a few times in person.
[02:24:07.834 --> 02:24:11.516]  Followed your work for many years before you worked for us, but what do you add to this?
[02:24:11.516 --> 02:24:15.519]  Do you disagree with me that it's spiritual, or have you ever seen this, these people, the way they act?
[02:24:17.599 --> 02:24:18.039]  100% Alex.
[02:24:18.039 --> 02:24:28.023]  I say with anyone that I'm having a candid conversation with that politics is just the playing field, but the real war that's going on behind the scenes is spiritual.
[02:24:28.023 --> 02:24:34.425]  And at this point, I think that's clearer than ever, especially with this battle between globalists and nationalists at this point.
[02:24:34.425 --> 02:24:35.605]  I think the nation-state
[02:24:36.165 --> 02:24:36.845]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:54.358 --> 02:25:03.964]  For their movement and their agenda, it would be even less popular, but they have to rely on subversion and sabotage and lying in order to advance the football at all.
[02:25:03.964 --> 02:25:13.029]  But I think people are starting to see through that now, and this is definitely a battle between good and evil that is playing out on the political battlefield right now.
[02:25:13.029 --> 02:25:17.532]  So, nationalism versus globalism is good versus evil.
[02:25:17.532 --> 02:25:22.315]  That's the headline for this segment and the next few, and you're going to have the floor when we come back.
[02:25:25.185 --> 02:25:26.706]  It doesn't seem like it is.
[02:25:26.706 --> 02:25:27.827]  People are choosing sides.
[02:25:27.827 --> 02:25:29.208]  There is a polarization.
[02:25:29.208 --> 02:25:31.609]  Well, the Bible says that, and common sense says it.
[02:25:31.609 --> 02:25:33.391]  You do want a polarization.
[02:25:33.391 --> 02:25:38.414]  Either your wife loves you, or your husband loves you, or either the company you work for cares about you, or they don't.
[02:25:38.414 --> 02:25:39.455]  We need polarization.
[02:25:39.455 --> 02:25:41.416]  We need to make stuff black and white here, dammit!
[02:25:42.432 --> 02:25:48.816]  Well, again, I didn't get into this to do spiritual things or to talk about God or anything like that.
[02:25:48.816 --> 02:25:51.017]  I got into this for political reasons.
[02:25:51.017 --> 02:25:55.580]  Oh, I mean, when you were out there with the most viral guy on the internet three, four years ago, you were just covering nothing but free speech.
[02:25:56.423 --> 02:26:02.286]  And over time, you know, it's just been more and more of a spiritual battle to me.
[02:26:02.286 --> 02:26:04.547]  And there's so much other stuff that goes on too.
[02:26:04.547 --> 02:26:07.088]  I mean, you know, I meet the people at an event like yesterday.
[02:26:07.088 --> 02:26:08.529]  They talk about how they pray for us.
[02:26:08.529 --> 02:26:11.590]  I can't even tell, I can't even explain how much that fills my heart.
[02:26:11.590 --> 02:26:12.551]  Is it not humbling though?
[02:26:13.271 --> 02:26:15.032]  It gives me all the confidence I need.
[02:26:15.032 --> 02:26:25.037]  And, you know, again, it's like, I don't know how to explain it, but when this happened yesterday and people saw these flyers around town with my address on it, they were like, are you scared?
[02:26:25.037 --> 02:26:25.898]  Like, you know, do you need help?
[02:26:25.898 --> 02:26:26.538]  We're praying for you.
[02:26:26.538 --> 02:26:29.179]  I'm like, look, your prayers is all I need.
[02:26:29.179 --> 02:26:32.381]  You know, I've got a Second Amendment here and, you know, hopefully I don't have to use it.
[02:26:32.381 --> 02:26:35.943]  But honestly, your prayers are more important than than anything that I can do.
[02:26:35.943 --> 02:26:36.463]  Let me guess.
[02:26:36.463 --> 02:26:40.145]  I bet you're sleeping better than ever.
[02:26:40.145 --> 02:26:41.726]  I can't believe you just said that, Alex.
[02:26:43.536 --> 02:26:45.158]  Is it true?
[02:26:45.158 --> 02:26:47.401]  Uh, more than you actually realize, probably.
[02:26:47.401 --> 02:26:49.543]  Oh, what's funny?
[02:26:49.543 --> 02:26:50.945]  I sleep better when I'm under attack.
[02:26:52.029 --> 02:26:59.033]  Uh, no, I actually have, I've actually, throughout my life, really, last five years or so, have, uh, have dealt with, actually, serious insomnia.
[02:26:59.033 --> 02:27:00.393]  I didn't know that.
[02:27:00.393 --> 02:27:06.396]  And after, after this weekend, I slept for the first time, actually, I'll say it on air, in seven days.
[02:27:06.396 --> 02:27:07.157]  See?
[02:27:07.157 --> 02:27:10.318]  Because your spirit was restless, now you're on your mission.
[02:27:10.318 --> 02:27:11.319]  You see how that works?
[02:27:11.319 --> 02:27:15.121]  People that are, people that are bad, I'm not saying you were bad before, you were on your mission, they have trouble sleeping.
[02:27:15.121 --> 02:27:17.362]  You get on your mission, you'll sleep like a dead pharaoh, my friend.
[02:27:17.984 --> 02:27:20.605]  And if the mission is foggy, you can't sleep at all.
[02:27:20.605 --> 02:27:25.728]  And I think that what it comes down to, though, Alex, again, I didn't get in this for spiritual reasons.
[02:27:25.728 --> 02:27:29.170]  I got in this because I was more of an operative in the 3D world.
[02:27:29.170 --> 02:27:35.433]  I was a worldly person, and I just saw the fake news, and I saw where the country was going, and I just wanted to have freedom for the future.
[02:27:35.433 --> 02:27:37.374]  But it becomes more and more spiritual every day.
[02:27:37.374 --> 02:27:38.914]  And it's just sad.
[02:27:38.914 --> 02:27:42.616]  I mean, I remember I met Dan in Cleveland at the RMC in 2016.
[02:27:42.616 --> 02:27:44.537]  We were walking around, man.
[02:27:44.537 --> 02:27:45.718]  We walked around in our Trump hats.
[02:27:46.318 --> 02:27:49.382]  The Trump protesters back then were just as hateful.
[02:27:49.382 --> 02:27:50.704]  Yeah, F you!
[02:27:50.704 --> 02:27:52.906]  Screw you, Nazi!
[02:27:52.906 --> 02:27:57.232]  And it's just like, man, I'm just out here because I like a guy for president.
[02:27:57.232 --> 02:27:59.574]  Like, what the heck did I do that's so bad?
[02:27:59.574 --> 02:28:02.178]  But then you realize that it's a spiritual battle.
[02:28:02.178 --> 02:28:03.659]  Trump is being prayed for every day.
[02:28:03.659 --> 02:28:05.562]  Trump is bringing God back into the White House.
[02:28:05.922 --> 02:28:08.285]  Oh, there's no doubt Trump was anointed.
[02:28:08.285 --> 02:28:10.648]  There's no doubt M4 was the enemy.
[02:28:10.648 --> 02:28:12.511]  We have the mark on us of God.
[02:28:12.511 --> 02:28:15.354]  Doesn't mean we're perfect, but we've been chosen.
[02:28:15.354 --> 02:28:16.716]  That's why they're so pissed, man.
[02:28:16.716 --> 02:28:17.997]  They see it.
[02:28:17.997 --> 02:28:19.780]  They're spiritually dead and they see it.
[02:28:20.913 --> 02:28:23.354]  We're gonna go to break, come back with Dan Lyman, give him the floor.
[02:28:23.354 --> 02:28:24.035]  He's joined us.
[02:28:24.035 --> 02:28:25.516]  Amazing news on Europe.
[02:28:25.516 --> 02:28:26.536]  This is real, folks.
[02:28:26.536 --> 02:28:28.237]  This is about your soul.
[02:28:28.237 --> 02:28:31.159]  And, uh, you gotta go out to these abortion rallies, man.
[02:28:31.159 --> 02:28:35.801]  It's not like 10% or 20%, about half of them, you'll think, okay, they're doing this to shock me.
[02:28:35.801 --> 02:28:40.164]  And then all of a sudden, you'll get footage by one of your other camera folks that doesn't say they're with you.
[02:28:40.164 --> 02:28:42.645]  And they're like going, I just want to murder the babies.
[02:28:42.645 --> 02:28:43.866]  I hate children.
[02:28:43.866 --> 02:28:45.207]  Dirty filth.
[02:28:45.207 --> 02:28:48.068]  Once they start talking, I hate the way babies talk.
[02:28:48.068 --> 02:28:49.029]  I want to cut them up.
[02:28:49.309 --> 02:28:50.050]  You heard her earlier.
[02:28:50.050 --> 02:28:55.233]  She's like, once they start running, they're dirty little MOVES!
[02:28:55.233 --> 02:28:59.776]  If you are trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.776 --> 02:29:01.878]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.878 --> 02:29:03.619]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.619 --> 02:29:10.164]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.164 --> 02:29:15.247]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.247 --> 02:29:19.070]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't
[02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:20.371]  You can't do it alone.
[02:29:20.371 --> 02:29:23.494]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:23.494 --> 02:29:30.500]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[02:30:56.075 --> 02:31:07.866]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:31:07.866 --> 02:31:16.234]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with, and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[02:31:16.234 --> 02:31:20.357]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[02:31:21.218 --> 02:31:26.825]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.
[02:31:26.825 --> 02:31:27.946]  Literally.
[02:31:27.946 --> 02:31:38.639]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[02:31:39.159 --> 02:31:41.402]  Our Ultimate Bone Broth Formula is amazing.
[02:31:41.402 --> 02:31:46.268]  It's 50% off right now at FullMorseTour.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[02:31:46.268 --> 02:31:49.131]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[02:31:49.131 --> 02:31:55.278]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that has taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[02:31:55.839 --> 02:32:00.023]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:32:00.023 --> 02:32:01.084]  They are technocrats.
[02:32:01.084 --> 02:32:03.366]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:32:03.366 --> 02:32:10.733]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:32:10.733 --> 02:32:12.614]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:32:12.614 --> 02:32:15.077]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:32:15.077 --> 02:32:17.159]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect
[02:32:17.699 --> 02:32:21.562]  To forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:32:21.562 --> 02:32:26.746]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:32:26.746 --> 02:32:35.752]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12, that was incredibly high quality, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:32:36.733 --> 02:32:42.717]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[02:32:42.717 --> 02:32:43.657]  It is amazing.

[02:32:52.883 --> 02:32:54.404]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:15.285 --> 02:33:17.789]  Owen Schroeder, Dan Lyman, report.
[02:33:17.789 --> 02:33:21.375]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:21.375 --> 02:33:23.618]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.618 --> 02:33:27.925]  That's right, crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:27.925 --> 02:33:30.128]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:33:32.432 --> 02:33:34.395]  Alright, going back to Dan Lyman.
[02:33:34.395 --> 02:33:35.997]  Euroboars.com.
[02:33:35.997 --> 02:33:44.731]  Only you, the viewers and listeners, the most hardcore promoters of freedom, can carry that website forward with the incredible reportage he and others bring you there that he heads up.
[02:33:44.731 --> 02:33:45.992]  Euroboars.com.
[02:33:45.992 --> 02:33:46.834]  Salvini, the leader of...
[02:33:48.522 --> 02:33:49.363]  Italy.
[02:33:49.363 --> 02:33:52.606]  Europe is tired of being a slave to the elite.
[02:33:52.606 --> 02:34:04.599]  Tell us about the amazing... I mean, again, I don't even have words to describe how big these victories are for populism and nationalism despite the media blackouts, the censorship, the demonization.
[02:34:04.599 --> 02:34:06.681]  You're in the heart of Europe.
[02:34:06.681 --> 02:34:08.222]  Dan Lyman, EuropeWars.com.
[02:34:08.222 --> 02:34:09.584]  Tell us what's happening with these elections.
[02:34:10.902 --> 02:34:14.305]  Stunning, stunning election results yesterday, of course.
[02:34:14.305 --> 02:34:16.827]  I want to take us, actually, off to the side here.
[02:34:16.827 --> 02:34:20.150]  Belgium held, they called it a super Sunday, I believe.
[02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:21.911]  It was three different elections.
[02:34:21.911 --> 02:34:25.034]  The regional elections, the federal elections, and the European elections.
[02:34:25.034 --> 02:34:26.816]  They held them all yesterday.
[02:34:26.816 --> 02:34:33.421]  And there's a party called Flams Belang, and they are basically just a right-wing nationalist populist party.
[02:34:33.421 --> 02:34:36.284]  They're very anti-EU, very anti-mass migration.
[02:34:36.984 --> 02:34:42.247]  And they had a huge surge yesterday that no one was, of course, that all the analysts missed.
[02:34:42.247 --> 02:34:51.352]  And in addition to a party that's a little bit more conservative than them, a little bit, not quite as intense, but the National Flemish Alliance, I believe they're called, NBA.
[02:34:52.172 --> 02:34:56.736]  And both of these parties did extremely well in the elections yesterday.
[02:34:56.736 --> 02:35:01.959]  And Flams Belong is spearheaded by a young man, Tom Van Grieken.
[02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:03.060]  I'd say he's in his early 30s.
[02:35:03.060 --> 02:35:04.782]  This guy is super promising.
[02:35:04.782 --> 02:35:08.324]  He's just as intelligent and hard-hitting as Salvini.
[02:35:08.324 --> 02:35:10.125]  And this guy's come out of nowhere in the last few years.
[02:35:10.125 --> 02:35:18.932]  And I want to take us back one year ago to an article we published at InfoWars Europe, when Jean-Claude Juncker actually made a visit to the Flemish Parliament in Belgium.
[02:35:19.873 --> 02:35:28.190]  And this guy, Tom Van Greeken, who leads the party, he directed comments literally to Junker's face on the floor, and he said,
[02:35:29.722 --> 02:35:33.265]  Nietzsche suggested, what doesn't destroy me makes me stronger.
[02:35:33.265 --> 02:35:40.292]  While the EU will not succeed in erasing the identity of the European nations, the resistance organizes and becomes stronger.
[02:35:40.292 --> 02:35:43.115]  We'll see you at the next European elections.
[02:35:43.115 --> 02:35:52.684]  And that was his shot across the bow a year ago, almost to the day, and I think that definitely came true and was accurate, as we saw by the results.
[02:35:52.684 --> 02:35:53.645]  So let's quantify this.
[02:35:55.188 --> 02:36:00.190]  Literally five years ago, Eurosceptics won 2% of the parliament.
[02:36:00.190 --> 02:36:01.931]  Now it's what, over 30%?
[02:36:01.931 --> 02:36:03.512]  Growing exponentially.
[02:36:03.512 --> 02:36:05.113]  They are hitting the panic button.
[02:36:05.113 --> 02:36:16.738]  I want to play a clip of Juncker, again the unelected head of the EU, the literal heir to the most powerful Nazi family after Hitler, who wasn't a family, he was the leader, the Fuhrer.
[02:36:17.947 --> 02:36:20.069]  But how are they going to strike back?
[02:36:20.069 --> 02:36:21.990]  Because you can see the tea leaves here.
[02:36:21.990 --> 02:36:26.233]  They admit that they're all going to be out of power come next election, even sooner.
[02:36:27.637 --> 02:36:45.326]  Yeah, that's what I've been thinking about, because this election result is so damaging, so punishing, that I would imagine the empire will strike back, and they will strike back hard, probably in the form of censorship, and they'll probably crank up the media attacks on anyone that's basically to the right of center.
[02:36:45.326 --> 02:36:48.647]  The way all of these articles are reading today, everybody's far right.
[02:36:48.647 --> 02:36:53.870]  People are going to be totally desensitized to that term at this point, when Nigel Farage is far right.
[02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:55.350]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:36:55.350 --> 02:36:56.031]  Well, I was about to say,
[02:36:57.892 --> 02:37:11.038]  I don't think they get when Juncker says how dare people love their country, they're stupid, and then he openly says let me bring in a bunch of foreigners, they hate our country, and has events with standing armies marching in.
[02:37:11.038 --> 02:37:12.599]  Don't they get that's going to backfire?
[02:37:12.599 --> 02:37:16.481]  They're not running operations against people 20 years ago that were in a coma.
[02:37:17.918 --> 02:37:21.220]  Well, some of these people are just so far out there, like Juncker, for instance.
[02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:24.142]  I mean, the guy is bombed half the time.
[02:37:24.142 --> 02:37:25.363]  He's a drunkard.
[02:37:25.363 --> 02:37:29.506]  And he just says things off the cuff that you just say, how does this guy get away with this?
[02:37:29.506 --> 02:37:30.687]  And he's on his way out.
[02:37:30.687 --> 02:37:32.968]  He won't be around much longer.
[02:37:32.968 --> 02:37:39.152]  But then they have people like Angela Merkel who are angling for to take positions in the EU at the super state level.
[02:37:39.152 --> 02:37:39.633]  Exactly.
[02:37:39.633 --> 02:37:42.394]  They get kicked out of their own governments with these elections.
[02:37:42.394 --> 02:37:46.597]  So now they move to the unelected super state, which, again, started as a so-called trade deal.
[02:37:46.597 --> 02:37:47.338]  Here's Juncker.
[02:37:47.938 --> 02:37:51.941]  Who again comes from German royalty, Austrian-Hungarian empire royalty.
[02:37:51.941 --> 02:37:56.585]  They were the most rich, powerful family in Germany in World War II.
[02:37:56.585 --> 02:38:01.129]  His father was in the top command of the Nazis, his grandfather.
[02:38:01.129 --> 02:38:06.033]  His father was a, in the war, a Nazi.
[02:38:06.033 --> 02:38:08.536]  But of course, part of the rat line, they were protected.
[02:38:08.536 --> 02:38:12.979]  So this is a literal Nazi running the EU project of the EU.
[02:38:12.979 --> 02:38:13.320]  Here he is.
[02:38:14.261 --> 02:38:21.065]  These populist nationalists, stupid nationalists, they are in love with their own country.
[02:38:21.065 --> 02:38:23.767]  And they don't like the others.
[02:38:23.767 --> 02:38:35.914]  In some countries of the European Union, the government, parliament, a major part of the society, don't like those coming from far away.
[02:38:35.914 --> 02:38:37.394]  Okay, so he goes, we like them.
[02:38:37.394 --> 02:38:37.995]  So let's stop there.
[02:38:37.995 --> 02:38:40.596]  I've already played this five times today, so I'm not going to play the whole clip.
[02:38:40.596 --> 02:38:41.757]  There's not even translation here.
[02:38:42.958 --> 02:38:47.321]  The people, the parliaments, they don't like the people far away.
[02:38:47.321 --> 02:39:05.492]  Yeah, when 80% are military age men, when they're brought in on North Africa, Middle East, where they're raping and killing, where the tourism is down 80%, and then you sit there and you say that people are bad and stupid because they don't want to export North Africa to Paris or to Frankfurt.
[02:39:05.492 --> 02:39:09.334]  I mean, as you said, there's plenty of him falling down drunk, out of his mind.
[02:39:09.714 --> 02:39:12.877]  But he basically is the richest guy in Europe, probably the richest man in the world.
[02:39:12.877 --> 02:39:14.718]  Some estimates are he's richer than the Rothschilds.
[02:39:14.718 --> 02:39:17.040]  I mean, this guy's worth trillions.
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:18.741]  Yeah, folks, it's not Bill Gates.
[02:39:18.741 --> 02:39:21.123]  So, maybe he's not arrogant.
[02:39:21.123 --> 02:39:22.584]  Maybe he knows something we don't know, Dan Lyman.
[02:39:24.252 --> 02:39:36.982]  That's certainly possible, but you know, when you hear the way he's talking and it kind of reminds me of the way that Pelosi sounds at times, it's like that friend who's had way too much to drink and then they're just saying like the craziest stuff off the top of their head.
[02:39:36.982 --> 02:39:40.505]  They might not even mean it, they might mean it, but they're just laying it out on the table.
[02:39:40.505 --> 02:39:46.650]  And by the way, I'm not saying that Rudolph Giuliani was helping Pelosi, Trump's chief legal advisor.
[02:39:46.650 --> 02:39:49.172]  I don't think that's the case.
[02:39:49.172 --> 02:39:52.415]  He's got his problems, but I think he's pro-Trump, pro-America at this point.
[02:39:52.415 --> 02:39:53.636]  He sees where the tea leaves are going.
[02:39:54.571 --> 02:39:57.213]  But for him to put out her at half speed, exactly.
[02:39:57.213 --> 02:40:00.355]  We have hours of her bumbling, doesn't know who she is.
[02:40:00.355 --> 02:40:06.740]  Why would you put out a slowed down audio when you've got all the damn proof?
[02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:07.560]  Yeah, poor decision.
[02:40:07.560 --> 02:40:08.721]  I mean, we got to be careful.
[02:40:08.721 --> 02:40:12.684]  There's no need for missteps, especially something that's that obvious.
[02:40:12.684 --> 02:40:15.006]  So yeah, can't say I support that one at all.
[02:40:15.006 --> 02:40:17.648]  We can stick to putting out accurate, correct.
[02:40:17.648 --> 02:40:18.689]  But you know why it happened?
[02:40:18.689 --> 02:40:20.710]  Because sometimes she sounds just like that.
[02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:21.591]  People thought it was real.
[02:40:22.785 --> 02:40:23.687]  He didn't put that out there.
[02:40:23.687 --> 02:40:24.308]  It was fake.
[02:40:24.308 --> 02:40:26.172]  She already sounds so brain damaged.
[02:40:26.172 --> 02:40:26.814]  That's why it happened.
[02:40:28.288 --> 02:40:31.291]  Right, it's kind of like that AOC parody account that was taken down.
[02:40:31.291 --> 02:40:35.114]  People were kind of worried that it was starting to sound just like her own account.
[02:40:35.114 --> 02:40:36.335]  It was hard to tell the difference.
[02:40:36.335 --> 02:40:38.777]  So, yeah, these people are just off their rockers.
[02:40:38.777 --> 02:40:43.120]  And I kind of want to tie that in, actually, to what happened in the elections yesterday in Germany.
[02:40:43.120 --> 02:40:46.983]  What we have here in Europe, I think, is two forms of populism.
[02:40:46.983 --> 02:40:54.830]  We have a radical left-wing populism, which is a very environmentally-based climate change agenda, and that's where a lot of voters went in Germany.
[02:40:56.270 --> 02:40:58.211]  That's Soros AstroTurf.
[02:40:58.211 --> 02:41:05.992]  They realize everybody's leaving the establishment, globalist EU things, so they've created new leftist AstroTurf, just like AOC here.
[02:41:05.992 --> 02:41:07.572]  That's exactly what I was going to say.
[02:41:07.572 --> 02:41:17.494]  They're collecting these people who have become disenfranchised with the establishment, and they're herding a lot of them over into this other movement where they have, it's basically based on climate change.
[02:41:17.494 --> 02:41:24.475]  I mean, they had all these crazy rallies in Switzerland and Germany on Friday, right before the election, all the students out marching.
[02:41:24.855 --> 02:41:31.544]  They're all rallying around this Swedish girl, Greta Thunberg, and they've made her the new prophet of the movement.
[02:41:31.544 --> 02:41:35.690]  But that's where a lot of the German voters went in the election year.
[02:41:35.690 --> 02:41:40.917]  The Greens did very well, I believe they placed in second, and the AFD did not do so well.
[02:41:41.437 --> 02:41:46.962]  They only did well really in the East German side, which was formerly communist, which is interesting.
[02:41:46.962 --> 02:42:01.455]  It really highlights that divide between the formerly communist states like Hungary and Poland and the Czech and then East Germany, of course, and how they're responding to the establishment as opposed to Western
[02:42:01.915 --> 02:42:02.455]  Thank you.
[02:42:16.078 --> 02:42:32.464]  It's been under tyranny, been under communism, been under Islamic invasion, super nationalist, George Washington 2.0, you know, Donald Trump, beyond Donald Trump, M4s, and now even East Germany gets it because they've seen this animal before.
[02:42:32.464 --> 02:42:35.025]  They know what a scam and tyranny looks like.
[02:42:35.025 --> 02:42:39.207]  We'll get into more facets of this historic victory for populism and nationalism.
[02:42:40.027 --> 02:42:43.428]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[02:42:43.428 --> 02:42:46.229]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[02:42:46.229 --> 02:42:48.870]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[02:42:48.870 --> 02:42:50.130]  And the globalists are so upset.
[02:42:50.130 --> 02:42:51.891]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[02:43:09.795 --> 02:43:14.857]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[02:43:14.857 --> 02:43:15.818]  So we looked at that.
[02:43:15.818 --> 02:43:17.438]  We made the very best a.m.
[02:43:17.438 --> 02:43:17.879]  and p.m.

[02:43:57.192 --> 02:44:01.895]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[02:44:01.895 --> 02:44:12.363]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLive.com.

[02:44:42.412 --> 02:44:43.893]  I stayed up late last night playing
[02:45:54.994 --> 02:45:56.576]  And get the fish oil.

[02:46:59.733 --> 02:47:02.359]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:32.842 --> 02:47:37.286]  Alright folks, I don't want to get hysterical here, but I do.
[02:47:37.286 --> 02:47:39.248]  Alex Jones back live.
[02:47:39.248 --> 02:47:47.395]  The globalists want to have us have learned helplessness, or a term I've coined, mass Stockholm syndrome.
[02:47:47.395 --> 02:47:59.006]  I've got a stack, and when I say a stack of news, every one of these articles I either read or scanned over,
[02:48:00.987 --> 02:48:04.849]  And that stuff, each one of these we could talk for an hour on.
[02:48:04.849 --> 02:48:06.891]  Each one of these is so bombshell.
[02:48:06.891 --> 02:48:12.854]  And a good 15 articles in this stack.
[02:48:12.854 --> 02:48:22.520]  Is the governor of New Mexico a libtard saying we don't want any borders?
[02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:24.421]  So the Border Patrol cut back there.
[02:48:25.956 --> 02:48:28.679]  And now it's overrun everywhere.
[02:48:28.679 --> 02:48:31.681]  She wouldn't send the National Guard, wouldn't send the National Guard.
[02:48:31.681 --> 02:48:39.629]  And there are tent cities everywhere, leprosy, bubonic plague, drug-resistant TB.
[02:48:39.629 --> 02:48:41.651]  Areas of New Mexico are collapsing.
[02:48:41.651 --> 02:48:44.433]  It's already been happening in Texas.
[02:48:44.433 --> 02:48:50.098]  Texas is spending billions of its own money every year just to try to get treatment because the Border Patrol is overwhelmed.
[02:48:50.098 --> 02:48:51.600]  They can't even test somebody for diseases.
[02:48:53.404 --> 02:48:55.065]  Here are some of the headlines.
[02:48:55.065 --> 02:48:58.048]  And then it talks about the Border Patrol is getting sick.
[02:48:58.048 --> 02:48:59.870]  It's over 100,000 that they're catching.
[02:48:59.870 --> 02:49:03.793]  Hundreds of thousands more make it through.
[02:49:03.793 --> 02:49:05.614]  And I was talking just this morning.
[02:49:15.458 --> 02:49:19.139]  To a federal law enforcement officer in New Mexico.
[02:49:19.139 --> 02:49:26.320]  And it's strange synergy, because an hour after I talked to him, I got a call from Mike Adams, another source, saying... Hell, I'll show you Mike's text.
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:28.521]  It wasn't a secret text.
[02:49:28.521 --> 02:49:31.341]  Saying, law enforcement source... I mean, it's in the news.
[02:49:31.341 --> 02:49:38.683]  It's not like... It's not like, you know, this is even some secret.
[02:49:38.683 --> 02:49:41.083]  Got a source in Albuquerque on the street.
[02:49:41.083 --> 02:49:42.104]  State police everywhere.
[02:49:42.104 --> 02:49:43.644]  Illegals are running rampant.
[02:49:44.545 --> 02:49:48.386]  Setting up tents in people's yards, police telling citizens it's an invasion.
[02:49:48.386 --> 02:49:51.207]  Totally out of control, police threatening to arrest anyone.
[02:49:51.207 --> 02:49:52.787]  Filming.
[02:49:52.787 --> 02:49:55.488]  Yeah.
[02:49:55.488 --> 02:50:13.193]  And then Ann Coulter, who I've had Ann on over the years, I don't think she's a bad person, but it's an easy score to go, we've got over double the illegals coming in than we had under Obama, because the UN ran the total invasion once Trump got in and admitted they were doing it.
[02:50:14.514 --> 02:50:16.376]  And Owen and Dan, I look at this.
[02:50:37.418 --> 02:50:41.020]  People don't get 15 million illegals conservatively.
[02:50:41.020 --> 02:50:47.223]  Now they've been firing the heads of major police departments, what, federally, in Sweden, because they were covering up the number.
[02:50:47.223 --> 02:50:50.105]  It wasn't 2 million illegals in Sweden, it was 5 million!
[02:50:50.105 --> 02:50:51.746]  The number's probably 30 million in Europe!
[02:50:53.444 --> 02:50:54.665]  They tell us there's 20 million illegals.
[02:50:54.665 --> 02:50:56.666]  There's probably 50 million here.
[02:50:56.666 --> 02:50:58.726]  And again, there's no infrastructure.
[02:50:58.726 --> 02:50:59.927]  We're already collapsing.
[02:50:59.927 --> 02:51:01.148]  We're going bankrupt.
[02:51:01.148 --> 02:51:02.008]  The system's set up.
[02:51:02.008 --> 02:51:03.289]  Have your babies free.
[02:51:03.289 --> 02:51:04.349]  Get free welfare.
[02:51:04.349 --> 02:51:05.470]  The Democrats sign them up.
[02:51:05.470 --> 02:51:06.570]  Give them driver's licenses.
[02:51:06.570 --> 02:51:07.731]  They're voting!
[02:51:07.731 --> 02:51:11.092]  My God!
[02:51:11.092 --> 02:51:12.953]  It's an invasion.
[02:51:12.953 --> 02:51:13.813]  It's a takeover.
[02:51:13.813 --> 02:51:15.434]  I don't even dislike the illegals.
[02:51:15.434 --> 02:51:16.435]  They're fleeing tyranny.
[02:51:16.435 --> 02:51:16.795]  I get it.
[02:51:18.311 --> 02:51:26.075]  We are like a lifeboat that holds 100 people that's already got 200 in it and the water's up to the sides and we're about to go under.
[02:51:26.075 --> 02:51:31.618]  And the Democrats tried to say just six months ago, remember six months ago, there are no illegals.
[02:51:31.618 --> 02:51:32.839]  There are no caravans.
[02:51:32.839 --> 02:51:33.799]  It's a made up crisis.
[02:51:33.799 --> 02:51:38.642]  Now they say it's Trump's crisis and global warming did it.
[02:51:38.642 --> 02:51:44.405]  And AOC is running around saying cauliflower is colonialism at community gardens in New York.
[02:51:44.405 --> 02:51:44.905]  Number one.
[02:51:46.414 --> 02:51:50.416]  Cauliflower, I did deep research, probably comes out of Africa.
[02:51:50.416 --> 02:51:52.658]  It was all over the Middle East thousands of years ago.
[02:51:52.658 --> 02:51:57.340]  It was named by Arabs who were in Cyprus 1,300 years ago.
[02:51:57.340 --> 02:52:02.183]  But imagine saying, because it's white, it's white people, cauliflower grows in New York.
[02:52:02.183 --> 02:52:04.104]  You can grow whatever you want in a community garden.
[02:52:04.104 --> 02:52:05.345]  You get your plot, you do it.
[02:52:05.345 --> 02:52:09.187]  I've done a community garden here in Austin with my kids when they were little.
[02:52:09.187 --> 02:52:11.128]  That's the mental illness.
[02:52:11.128 --> 02:52:14.690]  She goes out and says, white people are growing cauliflower.
[02:52:14.690 --> 02:52:15.851]  We've got to stop it.
[02:52:17.028 --> 02:52:18.229]  And you think, well, that's crazy.
[02:52:18.229 --> 02:52:22.813]  It's meant to be crazy.
[02:52:22.813 --> 02:52:24.794]  My God.
[02:52:24.794 --> 02:52:29.298]  Owen Schroer, Dan Lyman, what we see in Europe is five years ahead of us, in my view.
[02:52:29.298 --> 02:52:34.562]  What we see happening here, Trump is set to declare a full-on national emergency.
[02:52:34.562 --> 02:52:35.603]  He's got to do it soon.
[02:52:35.603 --> 02:52:36.224]  What do you think, Owen?
[02:52:36.738 --> 02:52:45.260]  Well, I just want to say, you know, Alex, I've been working with you and listening to you and knowing you long enough that sometimes you say things that people think is outrageous and not possibly true.
[02:52:45.260 --> 02:52:48.961]  You removed the makeup from Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez.
[02:52:48.961 --> 02:52:52.883]  You may have a meth head, but I'm just going to leave that right there.
[02:52:52.883 --> 02:53:00.145]  You know, Alex, something that I'm continued to be reminded by, but is really more hitting home now as we're really getting into the trenches for 2020.
[02:53:01.567 --> 02:53:01.767]  I think?
[02:53:23.017 --> 02:53:25.340]  The school system is against him.
[02:53:25.340 --> 02:53:32.967]  We are talking about an entire infrastructure of corruption built up in this country for decades that one man is currently trying to take on as president.
[02:53:32.967 --> 02:53:35.350]  Now, that's why he needs our back.
[02:53:35.350 --> 02:53:36.992]  That's why, yes, we'll call it like it is.
[02:53:36.992 --> 02:53:38.373]  If Trump goes sideways, we'll say it.
[02:53:38.373 --> 02:53:39.834]  But man, one man.
[02:53:40.595 --> 02:53:43.196]  Against an entire infrastructure of corruption.
[02:53:43.196 --> 02:53:45.397]  He can't even get a damn border wall.
[02:53:45.397 --> 02:53:49.439]  He can't even get a question on the census that says, are you a U.S.
[02:53:49.439 --> 02:53:49.979]  citizen?
[02:53:49.979 --> 02:53:50.699]  Why?
[02:53:50.699 --> 02:53:54.641]  Because it's an entire infrastructure of corruption.
[02:53:54.641 --> 02:54:01.524]  So, like you said at the beginning, hopefully this is the beachhead and we just start to pour more people in.
[02:54:01.524 --> 02:54:02.344]  Well, here's an example.
[02:54:02.344 --> 02:54:04.965]  We'll go back to Dan Lyman and hold him over too with Papert.
[02:54:04.965 --> 02:54:05.906]  We're all going to host together here.
[02:54:08.424 --> 02:54:11.368]  Unless Lima's gotta go and I guess later they're in Europe.
[02:54:11.368 --> 02:54:13.391]  Let's think about this.
[02:54:13.391 --> 02:54:14.914]  Here's an example.
[02:54:14.914 --> 02:54:19.901]  Trump ordered Brennan to lose his national security clearance a month and a half, two months ago.
[02:54:19.901 --> 02:54:23.767]  And so the news, ah, Trump's powerless, the bureaucracy didn't follow his order.
[02:54:25.049 --> 02:54:28.031]  That's what happens at the White House.
[02:54:28.031 --> 02:54:30.693]  And they lie to his face, and then they don't execute.
[02:54:30.693 --> 02:54:32.594]  It's called sabotage.
[02:54:32.594 --> 02:54:34.035]  It's called treason.
[02:54:34.035 --> 02:54:36.296]  Dan Lyman, the parallels of Europe.
[02:54:36.296 --> 02:54:38.638]  What's the real number of Islamic invaders?
[02:54:38.638 --> 02:54:39.698]  How bad is it going to get?
[02:54:39.698 --> 02:54:40.479]  What's happening next?
[02:54:42.597 --> 02:55:00.072]  I'm scared to think what the real numbers are because you know we see what's going on in our own southern border that's one single border that's being basically maintained by one government and and they don't have any idea how many people are coming across I've seen I think it was a lieutenant governor of Texas said that for every one
[02:55:00.672 --> 02:55:01.393]  That is caught.
[02:55:01.393 --> 02:55:04.174]  There are two to three more that aren't caught.
[02:55:04.174 --> 02:55:19.305]  So just put that into perspective when you have one land border being manned by one government and compare that against an entire continent being manned by all these different governments, people flooding in from all different sides, coming by sea, by land, by air.
[02:55:19.305 --> 02:55:26.409]  So, I mean, the numbers, I would imagine they are just staggering if we knew exactly what they were, what they actually were.
[02:55:26.409 --> 02:55:28.691]  And we know that the governments are all working
[02:55:29.231 --> 02:55:38.702]  Over time, to hide all accuracy about numbers, whether it's who's coming in, what crimes they're committing, how many crimes they're committing, how much it's costing all of us.
[02:55:38.702 --> 02:55:45.090]  All those numbers are being obfuscated and unfortunately they're being caught in the act that just happened in the Netherlands last week, a huge scandal.
[02:55:45.570 --> 02:55:46.391]  Well, I want to be clear.
[02:55:46.391 --> 02:55:47.431]  You're racist if you like cauliflower.
[02:55:47.431 --> 02:55:50.333]  You're racist if you don't want to abort black babies.
[02:55:50.333 --> 02:55:51.614]  Most black folks are hard-working, great people.
[02:55:51.614 --> 02:55:57.738]  But I grew up in Dallas in the 80s, and there were a lot of racist black people that would attack you if you were white.
[02:56:14.804 --> 02:56:18.745]  I had a lot of black friends, but they would say, yeah, a lot of racist black people.
[02:56:18.745 --> 02:56:21.246]  I had black friends that said, yeah, you better not come over to my neighborhood and pick me up.
[02:56:21.246 --> 02:56:23.567]  You know, my neighbor says he might shoot you.
[02:56:23.567 --> 02:56:26.628]  I mean, they'd say, get out of here, whitey.
[02:56:26.628 --> 02:56:28.749]  But I'm like Martin Luther King.
[02:56:28.749 --> 02:56:33.971]  Whether you love him or hate him, I believe you judge people by what they stand for, who they are.
[02:56:33.971 --> 02:56:37.853]  But I know a lot of Austin police, and I've experienced it.
[02:56:37.853 --> 02:56:41.074]  There are a lot of incredible restaurants downtown, a lot of great restaurants in East Austin.
[02:56:42.566 --> 02:56:55.340]  But a couple years ago, I stopped going to them because, repeatedly, I had black guys come get around me and say, you better give us money or something bad's going to happen.
[02:56:55.340 --> 02:57:01.247]  And I weigh 250 pounds and, you know, I'm not the toughest guy around, but I don't look like a pushover.
[02:57:01.983 --> 02:57:05.566]  And I literally had to say no and stand my ground.
[02:57:05.566 --> 02:57:06.806]  And I talked to cops.
[02:57:06.806 --> 02:57:07.767]  They said, no, it's horrible.
[02:57:07.767 --> 02:57:09.268]  I know people I know being mugged.
[02:57:09.268 --> 02:57:10.529]  And it sort of come out in the news.
[02:57:10.529 --> 02:57:11.790]  They tried to cover it up.
[02:57:11.790 --> 02:57:18.094]  That it's open season on white people in Austin, in these areas.
[02:57:18.094 --> 02:57:20.476]  And the media, again, tries to cover it up.
[02:57:20.476 --> 02:57:22.778]  Some of it's come out now.
[02:57:22.778 --> 02:57:23.998]  And it's just so sad.
[02:57:23.998 --> 02:57:25.640]  The left has created an atmosphere.
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:31.126]  Where hunting white people is open season, and then Jussie Smollett makes it up.
[02:57:31.126 --> 02:57:34.430]  I want to finish up with Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com.
[02:57:34.430 --> 02:57:35.451]  Nolan Schroer.
[02:57:35.451 --> 02:57:36.713]  We'll continue with Tom Papert.
[02:57:36.713 --> 02:57:38.135]  I haven't even begun.
[02:57:38.135 --> 02:57:39.316]  Believe me, I'm way behind here.
[02:57:39.316 --> 02:57:40.718]  There's a lot coming up.
[02:57:40.718 --> 02:57:42.500]  Hour number four, straight ahead.
[02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:43.241]  NewsWars.com.

[02:58:48.115 --> 02:58:49.996]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:58:49.996 --> 02:58:50.856]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:58:50.856 --> 02:58:52.217]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:58:52.217 --> 02:58:53.737]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:58:53.737 --> 02:58:54.538]  I'm so excited.
[02:58:54.538 --> 02:58:55.438]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:58:55.438 --> 02:58:57.939]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:58:57.939 --> 02:59:00.440]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:59:00.440 --> 02:59:01.861]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:01.861 --> 02:59:03.282]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:03.282 --> 02:59:04.682]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:04.682 --> 02:59:05.943]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:05.943 --> 02:59:10.685]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:59:10.685 --> 02:59:11.865]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:11.865 --> 02:59:13.286]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:13.286 --> 02:59:15.087]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:15.087 --> 02:59:15.807]  Like, good!
[02:59:16.187 --> 02:59:16.767]  Whoa!
[02:59:16.767 --> 02:59:18.487]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:18.487 --> 02:59:22.668]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:59:22.668 --> 02:59:26.469]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:59:26.469 --> 02:59:28.489]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:59:28.489 --> 02:59:31.070]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[02:59:31.070 --> 02:59:31.810]  I'm thanking you.
[02:59:31.810 --> 02:59:38.251]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:59:38.251 --> 02:59:39.091]  It is next level.
[02:59:39.091 --> 02:59:39.651]  It really is good.
[02:59:39.651 --> 02:59:40.211]  So thank you.
[02:59:40.211 --> 02:59:42.132]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:42.132 --> 02:59:42.512]  Thank you.
[02:59:49.298 --> 02:59:55.545]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.545 --> 03:00:02.612]  And we're gonna ride.
[03:00:02.612 --> 03:00:07.057]  We're gonna ride.
[03:00:07.057 --> 03:00:11.621]  Ride like a one-eyed jack-o'-diamond with the devil close behind.
[03:00:15.552 --> 03:00:20.096]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[03:00:20.096 --> 03:00:26.722]  The Lone Star State, I'm proud, stands up against the globalists organically.
[03:00:26.722 --> 03:00:28.524]  No.
[03:00:28.524 --> 03:00:30.986]  We're not funded by any U.S.
[03:00:30.986 --> 03:00:33.308]  government agency.
[03:00:33.308 --> 03:00:37.212]  We're not created by some shadowy group.
[03:00:37.212 --> 03:00:40.075]  We're funded by viewers and listeners just like you.
[03:00:41.567 --> 03:00:47.009]  Just like you know you're for real and you love God and country, and love freedom, so do we.
[03:00:47.009 --> 03:00:53.151]  And that's why the enemy always says we're fake, or we're run by something else, or we're told what to do.
[03:00:53.151 --> 03:01:03.575]  That's why I've really intellectually thought about it, as we finish up with Dan Lyman and the great job he's doing at EuropeWars.com, to stop holding back about the influence of InfoWars.
[03:01:03.575 --> 03:01:06.956]  Because the enemy knows this, and the enemy's aware of it.
[03:01:09.022 --> 03:01:10.423]  They're aware of what you're doing.
[03:01:10.423 --> 03:01:13.445]  You really are the power of this organization.
[03:01:13.445 --> 03:01:14.426]  They are who you fear.
[03:01:14.426 --> 03:01:17.709]  I'm talking about the establishment.
[03:01:17.709 --> 03:01:22.292]  The listeners are who the establishment fears.
[03:01:22.292 --> 03:01:27.256]  And so, we don't take the orders.
[03:01:27.256 --> 03:01:28.017]  We give the orders.
[03:01:28.017 --> 03:01:30.239]  I'm going to briefly talk about that at the start of the next segment.
[03:01:30.239 --> 03:01:32.220]  That's not bragging.
[03:01:32.220 --> 03:01:34.442]  I've really had to analyze why their after is so bad.
[03:01:34.442 --> 03:01:37.885]  And I knew we were contributing a lot to the course of things,
[03:01:41.183 --> 03:01:48.608]  It's very sacred, the position we're in.
[03:01:48.608 --> 03:02:01.197]  Because what I talk about, what we put out here, is obviously looked into, but it's taken immediately as the truth.
[03:02:01.197 --> 03:02:05.440]  Because even if we're wrong, smart people understand the intent is good and that there's going to be truth in it.
[03:02:06.533 --> 03:02:10.157]  That's a very powerful position to be in, and I don't seek power.
[03:02:10.157 --> 03:02:13.060]  You don't seek power as an audience, but believe me, we have it.
[03:02:13.060 --> 03:02:16.423]  And the enemy wants to take it from us so they can have power over us.
[03:02:16.423 --> 03:02:19.306]  We weren't looking for power because we were already born with it.
[03:02:19.306 --> 03:02:21.027]  We have the birthright.
[03:02:21.027 --> 03:02:26.173]  If you tune into liberty, if you love freedom, if you love God, if you love justice, you've got the birthright.
[03:02:26.173 --> 03:02:28.315]  You can be Hispanic, black, old, young, white.
[03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:34.226]  If you love God and justice, God's seal is on your heart.
[03:02:34.226 --> 03:02:37.650]  And this really is about what team you're on, who you resonate with.
[03:02:37.650 --> 03:02:42.456]  Dan Lyman, incredible job at EuropeWars.com, and we just can't say enough about the great work you do.
[03:02:42.456 --> 03:02:45.440]  What else should you impart to the viewers out there across the world?
[03:02:46.764 --> 03:02:48.785]  Well, I think that this is such an interesting time.
[03:02:48.785 --> 03:02:55.069]  It's a pivotal moment and we have some real clear evidence that the tide is turning after yesterday.
[03:02:55.069 --> 03:03:04.414]  And I think that we're going to start seeing some really interesting things happen at the national government levels now that, you know, the lines, the dividing lines have been drawn.
[03:03:04.414 --> 03:03:07.576]  We have people like Merkel and Macron and May.
[03:03:07.576 --> 03:03:08.536]  They're all wounded.
[03:03:08.536 --> 03:03:09.537]  They're all going down.
[03:03:09.537 --> 03:03:10.797]  They're on their way out the door.
[03:03:10.797 --> 03:03:13.539]  And we have people like Salvini, Farage,
[03:03:14.759 --> 03:03:39.128]  And and Le Pen all on the ascendancy so things that we start here at this this globalist level deal them a Really brutal blow yesterday and now turn it into an effective Transition moment into the at the national level so that we can really start peeling apart this this super state so to speak and They can get leadership in these countries that can navigate these countries back to
[03:03:39.748 --> 03:03:46.390]  Using a football analogy, NFL analogy, not Europe's football, correct me if I'm wrong, just in closing, I would say up until the last few minutes of the
[03:04:08.658 --> 03:04:10.498]  Second quarter, we were behind.
[03:04:10.498 --> 03:04:13.879]  We just got two touchdowns in the last five minutes.
[03:04:13.879 --> 03:04:21.901]  We're going out of halftime now with 14 points on the board, but the enemy is going to pull everything out they've got.
[03:04:21.901 --> 03:04:24.541]  We got two more quarters here, perhaps over time.
[03:04:24.541 --> 03:04:32.083]  I think we've, we're on the offense, we're winning, but if people think that, oh, everything's okay, we're going to lose.
[03:04:32.083 --> 03:04:32.583]  Absolutely.
[03:04:32.583 --> 03:04:38.244]  We're going to be, got to be prepared for all sorts of dirty trick plays on their end and to just fight through.
[03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:44.224]  Alright, Dan Lyman, EuropeWars.com.
[03:04:44.224 --> 03:04:48.869]  Only our listeners and viewers, only you, have the light in the dark of the night.
[03:04:48.869 --> 03:04:50.872]  Spread that link, EuropeWars.com.
[03:04:50.872 --> 03:04:52.154]  Dan Lyman, we salute you.
[03:04:54.628 --> 03:04:55.929]  Shut down our speech!
[03:04:55.929 --> 03:05:01.434]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:05:01.434 --> 03:05:03.055]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans.
[03:05:03.055 --> 03:05:05.217]  But almost all of a sudden, we used to love you on air.
[03:05:05.217 --> 03:05:08.940]  It was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:05:08.940 --> 03:05:10.282]  Are you coming back?
[03:05:10.282 --> 03:05:11.423]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:12.023 --> 03:05:13.384]  We're at NewsWars.com.
[03:05:13.384 --> 03:05:15.605]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[03:05:15.605 --> 03:05:16.565]  We have our own videos.
[03:05:16.565 --> 03:05:17.366]  We have our own articles.
[03:05:17.366 --> 03:05:22.388]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[03:05:22.388 --> 03:05:24.649]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:05:24.649 --> 03:05:27.911]  InfoWars.com, man!
[03:05:27.911 --> 03:05:28.251]  Woo!
[03:05:30.985 --> 03:05:33.727]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[03:05:33.727 --> 03:05:35.588]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[03:05:35.588 --> 03:05:38.210]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:05:38.210 --> 03:05:40.531]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:05:40.531 --> 03:05:44.034]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:05:44.034 --> 03:05:46.775]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:05:46.775 --> 03:05:49.057]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:05:49.057 --> 03:05:50.018]  That's where they find it.
[03:05:50.018 --> 03:05:51.899]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:05:51.899 --> 03:05:52.459]  Let's go there.
[03:06:02.268 --> 03:06:08.253]  I have sworn upon the altar of God.
[03:06:08.253 --> 03:06:11.656]  I did swear.
[03:06:11.656 --> 03:06:23.267]  And I poured my will and my intent forever to be a slave to the truth and to never turn back.
[03:06:24.492 --> 03:06:29.637]  Only commitments such as this will release you.
[03:06:29.637 --> 03:06:31.758]  Because you can't lie to yourself.
[03:06:31.758 --> 03:06:33.580]  Everyone makes commitments.
[03:06:33.580 --> 03:06:35.622]  Everyone chooses sides.
[03:06:35.622 --> 03:06:40.066]  Like Bob Dylan famously said, you will serve someone.
[03:06:40.066 --> 03:06:47.031]  So choose what you serve, or lie to yourself, and become a slave.
[03:06:47.031 --> 03:06:49.353]  Owen Schroeder!
[03:06:49.353 --> 03:06:50.755]  Beyond epic times.
[03:06:52.116 --> 03:06:54.519]  Beyond historic times.
[03:06:54.519 --> 03:07:01.106]  Imagine just 10 years ago hearing that world government would be out in the open and that everywhere there's an election they would lose.
[03:07:01.106 --> 03:07:08.193]  We'd have a president stopping the Federal Reserve from jackknifing the economy.
[03:07:08.193 --> 03:07:13.159]  Or that we'd see all the evil bum-rushing us in the final moments.
[03:07:15.612 --> 03:07:16.633]  I have some big breaking news.
[03:07:16.633 --> 03:07:24.757]  We're going to bring Tom Papert in here, TV station manager, owner, patriot, smart guy, riding shotgun with us.
[03:07:24.757 --> 03:07:28.159]  He'll take over here in a few segments completely.
[03:07:28.159 --> 03:07:32.222]  But I'm not saying, oh, you're lucky I came in on Memorial Day.
[03:07:32.222 --> 03:07:34.703]  I want to be here.
[03:07:34.703 --> 03:07:40.167]  Because Veterans Day is about all veterans and it's very important.
[03:07:40.167 --> 03:07:42.428]  But Memorial Day is about people that died.
[03:07:44.110 --> 03:07:47.071]  And you can say, well, some of these wars were lies and some of them were frauds.
[03:07:47.071 --> 03:07:49.152]  It doesn't matter.
[03:07:49.152 --> 03:08:04.840]  The men and some of the women, but the women that lost their men, people that lost their fathers and brothers, and the women as nurses that went down on ships, torpedoes, they believed in something greater.
[03:08:04.840 --> 03:08:06.301]  And they were willing to put it all on the line.
[03:08:06.301 --> 03:08:08.602]  I think that's what's important we honor now.
[03:08:10.014 --> 03:08:16.800]  Because in today's war, we've got to be demonizing, lying about, and yeah, they've put posters up where Owen lives and say, come kill him.
[03:08:16.800 --> 03:08:21.145]  And so there's some danger, but we don't let the danger define us.
[03:08:21.145 --> 03:08:28.071]  We let the fact that we are victorious and we're standing up for the unborn, standing up for our sovereignty, that defines us.
[03:08:28.071 --> 03:08:33.036]  We're targets, not victims as Tommy Robinson, who barely lost in his run.
[03:08:34.448 --> 03:08:38.454]  And when the numbers weren't coming in Saturday like they were supposed to, I said, I think they're gonna steal it from Tommy.
[03:08:38.454 --> 03:08:40.657]  And I almost shot a special report.
[03:08:40.657 --> 03:08:41.098]  But I didn't.
[03:08:41.098 --> 03:08:42.880]  I shot eight other reports.
[03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:48.128]  Saying, Tommy Robinson... I wanted to get his permission and he was so busy he wouldn't answer.
[03:08:48.128 --> 03:08:49.350]  Tommy Robinson wins!
[03:08:50.922 --> 03:08:53.464]  European Union Parliament seat.
[03:08:53.464 --> 03:09:03.793]  And I was going to say, even if he doesn't win, he won by going out, being attacked by mobs, speaking out, going all over TV and radio, circumventing the censorship, and building a coalition.
[03:09:03.793 --> 03:09:05.214]  And he did.
[03:09:05.214 --> 03:09:15.223]  When you go out and take action, when you're the man or woman in the arena, and your heart's right, and you fight hard, you're not a loser when you lose.
[03:09:15.223 --> 03:09:18.966]  I failed thousands of times in the 25 years I've been on air.
[03:09:20.373 --> 03:09:23.193]  And I do shows routinely that I think I did a bad job.
[03:09:23.193 --> 03:09:24.654]  Doesn't matter, my heart's right.
[03:09:24.654 --> 03:09:27.054]  And God chose King David and said, a man of his own heart.
[03:09:27.054 --> 03:09:27.954]  He did horrible things.
[03:09:27.954 --> 03:09:30.355]  Had his best friend killed in a moment of total loss.
[03:09:30.355 --> 03:09:31.695]  He wanted that wife.
[03:09:31.695 --> 03:09:33.475]  He let her repent it and he legitimately did it.
[03:09:33.475 --> 03:09:35.616]  And God said, you're a man of his own heart.
[03:09:35.616 --> 03:09:37.256]  I've never done anything close to that.
[03:09:37.256 --> 03:09:38.596]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[03:09:38.596 --> 03:09:40.617]  Far from it.
[03:09:40.617 --> 03:09:46.258]  But this is a real war, a real world, a real choice about your soul.
[03:09:46.258 --> 03:09:48.518]  Just like people know that digital data goes on forever.
[03:09:49.423 --> 03:09:52.845]  If it's saved, our souls are beyond that.
[03:09:52.845 --> 03:09:58.968]  And the enemy knows it, and they want us to be part of the devil's CD collection.
[03:09:58.968 --> 03:10:01.970]  Not to go on to the next level.
[03:10:01.970 --> 03:10:02.890]  And that's what this is all about.
[03:10:02.890 --> 03:10:04.311]  That's why they hate us.
[03:10:04.311 --> 03:10:06.412]  Because we're saying, you have value.
[03:10:06.412 --> 03:10:07.813]  Humanity has value.
[03:10:07.813 --> 03:10:09.174]  There is human life.
[03:10:09.174 --> 03:10:10.515]  There is a God.
[03:10:10.515 --> 03:10:13.776]  Babies have value.
[03:10:13.776 --> 03:10:14.797]  You go out to a Lepus event,
[03:10:17.449 --> 03:10:20.831]  And half of them will tell you they're devil worshippers.
[03:10:20.831 --> 03:10:21.731]  They're not trying to upset you.
[03:10:21.731 --> 03:10:22.192]  It's who they are.
[03:10:22.192 --> 03:10:23.432]  It's their operating system.
[03:10:23.432 --> 03:10:25.633]  Believe it or not, they say they don't believe in the devil, but they do.
[03:10:25.633 --> 03:10:26.414]  They manifest it.
[03:10:26.414 --> 03:10:27.354]  See the deception?
[03:10:27.354 --> 03:10:28.215]  Devil isn't real.
[03:10:28.215 --> 03:10:31.056]  I'm deceiving you, but I want to kill babies up to age three.
[03:10:31.056 --> 03:10:32.217]  They say there is no life.
[03:10:32.217 --> 03:10:33.578]  There's nothing anyways.
[03:10:33.578 --> 03:10:34.999]  You don't have any free will.
[03:10:34.999 --> 03:10:36.119]  You're just a machine.
[03:10:36.119 --> 03:10:37.760]  So let me tell you how to live!
[03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:40.942]  Cue her up.
[03:10:43.954 --> 03:10:44.555]  Caitlyn Bennett.
[03:10:44.555 --> 03:10:47.176]  I don't know what, we're going to put this video out on InfoWorks.com.
[03:10:47.176 --> 03:10:48.517]  It deserves to go totally viral.
[03:10:48.517 --> 03:10:53.361]  I'm going to ask, I'm going to ask Tom Pepper, what do you call it?
[03:10:53.361 --> 03:10:55.923]  Leftist video.
[03:10:55.923 --> 03:10:58.364]  Leftists say we should kill children up to age three.
[03:10:58.364 --> 03:11:05.690]  I mean, that's, see how just a few months ago it was the governor saying, we keep them comfortable.
[03:11:05.690 --> 03:11:09.632]  We decide they dead, take their organ.
[03:11:09.632 --> 03:11:11.474]  Then we resuscitate mama want them.
[03:11:12.619 --> 03:11:13.760]  It's all a bioethics term.
[03:11:13.760 --> 03:11:17.322]  They call the child dead, even though they're alive, until they decide to let them live.
[03:11:17.322 --> 03:11:21.285]  And they go, magic wand, resuscitate!
[03:11:21.285 --> 03:11:24.847]  Because they want to be able to keep them alive and take the organs.
[03:11:24.847 --> 03:11:25.728]  It's all games.
[03:11:25.728 --> 03:11:27.289]  And should we put up with this?
[03:11:27.289 --> 03:11:32.732]  These people's so-called authority over us when they had no authority?
[03:11:32.732 --> 03:11:33.873]  Here's that video one more time.
[03:11:34.906 --> 03:11:36.447]  So when do we cut off abortions?
[03:11:36.447 --> 03:11:37.547]  At what week?
[03:11:37.547 --> 03:11:40.188]  I think at three years old is when we should.
[03:11:40.188 --> 03:11:43.830]  You think at three years old is when we should stop aborting children?
[03:11:43.830 --> 03:11:45.631]  Yeah.
[03:11:45.631 --> 03:11:46.791]  Hey, pause and back this up.
[03:11:46.791 --> 03:11:47.892]  Hit pause.
[03:11:47.892 --> 03:11:50.233]  Start it over even before she gets to that point.
[03:11:50.233 --> 03:11:50.933]  Back it up like 40 seconds.
[03:11:50.933 --> 03:11:53.795]  I want you to hear the beginning of this.
[03:11:53.795 --> 03:12:02.919]  If you're a radio listener, she has the greenish white skin, collapsed shoulders, dead eyes, but when she talks about killing babies, she gets a smile and light comes in her eyes.
[03:12:03.953 --> 03:12:06.314]  Folks, you've seen the actresses.
[03:12:06.314 --> 03:12:07.194]  That's Linda Blair.
[03:12:07.194 --> 03:12:07.955]  That's an actress.
[03:12:07.955 --> 03:12:09.575]  This is real.
[03:12:09.575 --> 03:12:11.216]  This is who they are.
[03:12:11.216 --> 03:12:13.337]  And I told you their next plan is up to age three.
[03:12:13.337 --> 03:12:14.357]  That's the official rollout.
[03:12:14.357 --> 03:12:20.999]  She's now spouting Peter Singer, PETA, eugenics stuff.
[03:12:20.999 --> 03:12:23.100]  But just remember that.
[03:12:23.100 --> 03:12:29.503]  And she goes, yeah, they start talking a bunch by then and she's all disgusted by these other humans.
[03:12:29.503 --> 03:12:30.203]  She's not a human.
[03:12:31.781 --> 03:12:35.423]  Whatever it is, she's hijacked by a spirit.
[03:12:35.423 --> 03:12:36.284]  And I'm going to explain this.
[03:12:36.284 --> 03:12:38.365]  I knew God was real.
[03:12:38.365 --> 03:12:42.067]  Notice the media never attacks me for this stuff, even though it's far out.
[03:12:42.067 --> 03:12:45.409]  I knew God was real a long time ago.
[03:12:45.409 --> 03:12:49.972]  But I was in Seattle last year when you saw me get coffee dumped on me and the rest of it.
[03:12:49.972 --> 03:12:53.914]  We started running video all the time because it was so crazy.
[03:12:53.914 --> 03:12:56.135]  And Michael Zimmerman is a smart, tough guy.
[03:12:56.135 --> 03:12:58.057]  He wouldn't leave the hotel anymore after three days.
[03:12:58.057 --> 03:12:58.637]  We were there a week.
[03:13:01.189 --> 03:13:06.090]  And you know why?
[03:13:06.090 --> 03:13:15.493]  You ever seen, like, Christian horror movies where, like, Agent Smith, kind of the Matrix, jumps from one body to the next and finishes the sentences around each block?
[03:13:15.493 --> 03:13:18.174]  Like, hey, we're following you, we're gonna get you, Neo.
[03:13:18.174 --> 03:13:20.435]  Next block, yeah, I just saw you there, I'm gonna get you.
[03:13:20.435 --> 03:13:21.395]  Glad I just killed your friend.
[03:13:24.414 --> 03:13:30.815]  That's in the Bible, where you'll be walking through the city, and demons jumping into person after person, making statements as you go.
[03:13:30.815 --> 03:13:45.858]  And I'll never forget, we're walking down these streets, and I'm with my wife and my baby, and every third or fourth person would literally go like, we're gonna get you, you're gonna die in a demon voice.
[03:13:45.858 --> 03:13:53.319]  And this wasn't just them all getting together and doing this, and we turn the corner and they go, yeah, you think you just turned the corner, we're not here, it was the same voice.
[03:13:53.319 --> 03:13:53.839]  And you're like,
[03:13:55.046 --> 03:13:57.807]  Wait a minute.
[03:13:57.807 --> 03:14:01.668]  These people are so synced up to whatever it is running them.
[03:14:01.668 --> 03:14:02.408]  Maybe it's mind control.
[03:14:02.408 --> 03:14:05.509]  Maybe it's some secret broadcast system the government has they're testing in Seattle.
[03:14:05.509 --> 03:14:06.230]  I don't know.
[03:14:06.230 --> 03:14:12.772]  But they were saying the same stuff in the same order, in the same way.
[03:14:12.772 --> 03:14:17.653]  Like, I'm not even going to tell this story because she hasn't authorized me yet and I haven't talked to her since she was in Austin.
[03:14:17.653 --> 03:14:19.154]  But I talked to folks that were there.
[03:14:19.154 --> 03:14:23.155]  But Caitlin Bennett and Millie Weaver were down there when this woman said all this about killing babies up to age three.
[03:14:24.366 --> 03:14:32.007]  And it freaked them out because they would go, they were down there, and when they left, they would turn corners.
[03:14:32.007 --> 03:14:33.068]  And the same thing happened.
[03:14:33.068 --> 03:14:37.008]  People would walk up and finish the sentence.
[03:14:37.008 --> 03:14:44.049]  And they were saying terrible things to Caitlin about what they were going to do to her and about her body.
[03:14:44.049 --> 03:14:46.510]  And they were finishing the sentences.
[03:14:46.510 --> 03:14:47.730]  They hadn't been briefed, folks.
[03:14:47.730 --> 03:14:49.871]  These people can hardly tie their shoelaces.
[03:14:49.871 --> 03:14:52.331]  These are all incompetent losers, but what's in them
[03:14:54.039 --> 03:14:57.182]  Like when Christ comes along, the possessed guy, he says, who are you?
[03:14:57.182 --> 03:14:58.143]  They go, I am Legion.
[03:14:58.143 --> 03:15:00.185]  And Christ says, you know, out of them, Satan.
[03:15:00.185 --> 03:15:04.389]  And the demons go in the pigs and they run off the cliff.
[03:15:04.389 --> 03:15:08.953]  Because they wanted out of the pigs and back in humans.
[03:15:08.953 --> 03:15:10.534]  And you're like, oh, that's the Bible.
[03:15:10.534 --> 03:15:13.557]  No, it's just like the internet, just like programs are in the air.
[03:15:13.557 --> 03:15:16.220]  There's these programs, these spells, these people are under spells.
[03:15:16.220 --> 03:15:17.100]  They're under trances.
[03:15:17.100 --> 03:15:18.602]  They're under programs.
[03:15:20.037 --> 03:15:27.844]  And let me tell you, you haven't experienced it until you run into a nest of these people and they're finishing each other's sentences.
[03:15:27.844 --> 03:15:32.688]  I mean, it was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my life.
[03:15:32.688 --> 03:15:34.109]  And it is scary, folks.
[03:15:34.109 --> 03:15:36.331]  These people are possessed by something.
[03:15:36.331 --> 03:15:37.812]  Is it another dimension?
[03:15:37.812 --> 03:15:38.553]  Is it demons?
[03:15:38.553 --> 03:15:39.594]  Is it space aliens?
[03:15:39.594 --> 03:15:40.375]  I don't know.
[03:15:40.375 --> 03:15:42.697]  But they want to kill babies.
[03:15:44.466 --> 03:15:45.807]  They want to kill the planet.
[03:15:45.807 --> 03:15:49.229]  They want to kill you.
[03:15:49.229 --> 03:15:53.351]  It's real, folks.

[03:19:57.277 --> 03:19:59.919]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:18.500 --> 03:20:30.671]  By the way, I was watching, like, Court TV when it was still around, like, 15 years ago.
[03:20:30.671 --> 03:20:33.794]  And I keep telling the crew this, they're awesome, but we need to look this up.
[03:20:33.794 --> 03:20:36.136]  There was a blonde-haired, good-looking psychiatrist.
[03:20:36.136 --> 03:20:40.640]  I even went and bought one of her books when I saw her on Court TV.
[03:20:40.640 --> 03:20:41.241]  She was, um...
[03:20:43.871 --> 03:20:47.534]  Who is the guy that, Jeffrey Dahmer's psychiatrist.
[03:20:47.534 --> 03:20:51.957]  But she's the famous, just type in famous woman psychiatrist.
[03:20:51.957 --> 03:20:53.799]  Psychiatrist to the psychopaths.
[03:20:56.325 --> 03:20:56.846]  On television.
[03:20:56.846 --> 03:20:57.446]  I saw her on TV.
[03:20:57.446 --> 03:20:58.447]  I heard her on Coast to Coast.
[03:20:58.447 --> 03:20:59.628]  I saw it all over.
[03:20:59.628 --> 03:21:00.348]  I want to get her back on.
[03:21:00.348 --> 03:21:02.390]  She came on for like two hours on our show.
[03:21:02.390 --> 03:21:07.994]  And she never brought up the occult, but when I got her on, I said, listen, I've read your book.
[03:21:07.994 --> 03:21:09.035]  I've seen some of the stuff.
[03:21:09.035 --> 03:21:12.758]  These people think they're being demon possessed, and if they don't do it, the demons come after them.
[03:21:12.758 --> 03:21:13.738]  She goes, no, that's true.
[03:21:13.738 --> 03:21:16.280]  Everybody I talked to thought demons were making them do it.
[03:21:16.280 --> 03:21:19.162]  Now, whether you think that's psychiatric or real, it doesn't matter.
[03:21:19.162 --> 03:21:21.704]  It's a program they're running, and it's a big frustration.
[03:21:21.704 --> 03:21:24.506]  Over the years, I always remember this when I talk about it, and I kind of mention it.
[03:21:24.506 --> 03:21:25.067]  We never find it.
[03:21:27.728 --> 03:21:28.289]  I'll find it.
[03:21:28.289 --> 03:21:28.969]  Listeners will find it.
[03:21:28.969 --> 03:21:30.931]  They'll send it to us.
[03:21:30.931 --> 03:21:35.216]  She's like the psychiatrist to the serial killers, I think.
[03:21:35.216 --> 03:21:37.278]  And we should get her back on.
[03:21:37.278 --> 03:21:38.079]  But I'm digressing.
[03:21:38.079 --> 03:21:40.982]  We're going to go to Tom Papert right now about the world, what's happening on this Memorial Day.
[03:21:40.982 --> 03:21:42.463]  Appreciate him joining us.
[03:21:42.463 --> 03:21:44.966]  Oh, and comments on what I've been saying.
[03:21:44.966 --> 03:21:48.790]  Well, Alex, I would just say to kind of talk about the spiritual battle.
[03:21:50.370 --> 03:21:59.533]  In a final word, you know, if God is love and the devil is hate, I think that you can kind of break down everything like that.
[03:21:59.533 --> 03:22:08.817]  Because it doesn't matter what Trump does, he could cure cancer, he could end world hunger, you know, whatever, they'd still hate him.
[03:22:09.702 --> 03:22:12.944]  His, you know, his haters would still hate him.
[03:22:12.944 --> 03:22:14.085]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[03:22:14.085 --> 03:22:16.846]  The people are still, they're driven by hate.
[03:22:16.846 --> 03:22:24.550]  So when you see a young lady like in the Caitlyn Bennett video talking about aborting babies up to the age of three, you know, does she really believe that?
[03:22:24.550 --> 03:22:25.131]  Does she not?
[03:22:25.751 --> 03:22:26.452]  Probably not.
[03:22:26.452 --> 03:22:29.155]  What it is, is she's driven by hatred, Alex.
[03:22:29.155 --> 03:22:30.897]  She hates us.
[03:22:30.897 --> 03:22:32.699]  She hates America.
[03:22:32.699 --> 03:22:34.681]  She hates the fact that we stand up for babies.
[03:22:34.681 --> 03:22:36.843]  So, it doesn't matter what we stand up for.
[03:22:36.843 --> 03:22:42.629]  In fact, if we came out tomorrow and said, yeah, abort all babies up to three, all of a sudden they would be pro-life.
[03:22:42.629 --> 03:22:44.291]  That's what this is all about.
[03:22:44.291 --> 03:22:45.412]  They are driven by hate.
[03:22:45.993 --> 03:22:51.294]  Hate has filled their soul, and so whatever it is they hate, they go against it.
[03:22:51.294 --> 03:22:52.294]  There is no logic.
[03:22:52.294 --> 03:22:54.315]  No, I agree with you, but at the end of the day, it's about killing kids.
[03:22:54.315 --> 03:22:54.975]  They actually found her.
[03:22:54.975 --> 03:22:56.395]  Let's put her on screen.
[03:22:56.395 --> 03:23:02.356]  And this lady, Helen Morrison, forensic psychiatrist, interviewed all the big serial killers.
[03:23:02.356 --> 03:23:04.157]  We need to get her back on the show.
[03:23:04.157 --> 03:23:05.417]  Great points, Owen.
[03:23:05.417 --> 03:23:06.357]  Let's go to Tom Pepper.
[03:23:06.357 --> 03:23:07.477]  Tom, thanks for hosting.
[03:23:07.477 --> 03:23:10.438]  Thanks for joining us and the great work you do.
[03:23:10.438 --> 03:23:13.159]  You've been, of course, censored a lot for the OK symbol now.
[03:23:13.159 --> 03:23:14.699]  That was big national news last week.
[03:23:15.459 --> 03:23:16.840]  You're at Real G.E.
[03:23:16.840 --> 03:23:17.440]  Trump.
[03:23:17.440 --> 03:23:18.621]  God Emperor Trump.
[03:23:18.621 --> 03:23:19.601]  We're not saying he's an actual God.
[03:23:19.601 --> 03:23:20.561]  It's a joke, folks.
[03:23:20.561 --> 03:23:32.206]  Facebook.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com
[03:23:34.229 --> 03:23:35.350]  Well, there is a lot to cover.
[03:23:35.350 --> 03:23:45.155]  I want to talk about some of the recent fake news examples in the media, how they can say whatever they want, so they get by with it, but then, God forbid, somebody on the right gets a fact 2% wrong.
[03:23:45.155 --> 03:23:52.940]  But, you know, Alex, I've been listening to what you guys are talking about, about the greater spiritual battle that's going on here, and especially when it comes to these serial killers.
[03:23:52.940 --> 03:23:53.340]  You know, the
[03:23:53.900 --> 03:24:09.085]  The insane person in Florida from last year he actually said that in his tapes were the interview tapes where he was being interviewed by a police detective he said the demon talks to me and I have to do it the other one is in me and I have to do it so I think that you're absolutely on to something and I also think
[03:24:09.725 --> 03:24:19.055]  Regardless of what it is, if it's a code, if it's a demon, if it's a spirit, whatever it is, I think it's completely accurate that that is what caused these people.
[03:24:19.055 --> 03:24:27.123]  Both pastors for my church are currently in Tanzania right now doing missionary work and they've converted a thousand plus people doing some phenomenal work out there.
[03:24:27.863 --> 03:24:34.749]  And one of them, I was talking to him and he said, you know, I really didn't want to go on this thing, but I was singing one of our Gospels and I couldn't sing it.
[03:24:34.749 --> 03:24:39.834]  The Holy Spirit would not let me sing it because I wouldn't go where the Lord wanted me to go.
[03:24:39.834 --> 03:24:42.256]  And so then he agreed to go to Tanzania.
[03:24:42.256 --> 03:24:48.981]  And if that can happen, why on earth could that not happen with an evil force, a force of a demon or whatever it is?
[03:24:49.842 --> 03:24:53.664]  With these insane leftists, and you're right, I've experienced the same exact thing.
[03:24:53.664 --> 03:24:59.326]  They complete each other's sentences, they say the exact same script, and they're not talking to each other.
[03:24:59.326 --> 03:25:09.450]  And I think that's why, fascinatingly, when you get them on a one-on-one situation where they're not connected to the rest of the machine, you can almost talk some sense into them.
[03:25:09.450 --> 03:25:10.911]  But then, of course, they get back on mute.
[03:25:10.911 --> 03:25:11.251]  That's right.
[03:25:11.251 --> 03:25:13.212]  You'll see the transmission kind of break up.
[03:25:13.212 --> 03:25:14.492]  They'll go, wait, who am I?
[03:25:14.492 --> 03:25:14.752]  What?
[03:25:14.752 --> 03:25:17.573]  And I'll go, ah, shut up, I'll get you and your family.
[03:25:17.573 --> 03:25:18.034]  Oh, wait, what?
[03:25:19.220 --> 03:25:20.295]  I mean, it's crazy.
[03:25:21.187 --> 03:25:21.747]  Exactly.
[03:25:21.747 --> 03:25:26.670]  The very second they get back into their evil little tribe, everything you've done is gone.
[03:25:26.670 --> 03:25:34.974]  That's why, you know, that's why I think it's so important to do what InfoWars does, what I do, what Elwha does, what all of us do, because to an extent, there is no winning some of these people over.
[03:25:34.974 --> 03:25:36.635]  They have to make the decision on their own.
[03:25:36.635 --> 03:25:37.596]  They have to choose God.
[03:25:37.596 --> 03:25:38.636]  They have to choose love.
[03:25:38.636 --> 03:25:43.379]  They have to choose to look away from hate, as Owen would put it.
[03:25:43.379 --> 03:25:49.302]  And it is so, that's what makes this broadcast different because you guys are the tip of the spear and
[03:25:50.069 --> 03:25:53.213]  You're able to provide so much crucial information.
[03:25:53.213 --> 03:25:54.555]  Alex, I'm going to be completely honest.
[03:25:54.555 --> 03:26:00.343]  A month or so ago when I was on, you were talking about keeping the babies alive so you can harvest their organs.
[03:26:00.343 --> 03:26:02.405]  I kind of knew that that was a thing.
[03:26:02.405 --> 03:26:07.272]  But in the last month, we've seen not one, not two, but three different articles that I've read personally
[03:26:07.592 --> 03:26:09.653]  About Planned Parenthood doing exactly that!
[03:26:09.653 --> 03:26:13.555]  They keep the baby alive as long as they can so they can get more money for the organs.
[03:26:13.555 --> 03:26:17.457]  But they consider it legally dead because it was never born.
[03:26:17.457 --> 03:26:18.878]  It was never a human.
[03:26:18.878 --> 03:26:25.082]  So it's fascinating to me... Oh yeah, no, my dad... My dad was in medical management and...
[03:26:26.035 --> 03:26:29.896]  When I was growing up in Dallas, he even owned, with two partners, a hospital.
[03:26:29.896 --> 03:26:31.476]  And they weren't killing people.
[03:26:31.476 --> 03:26:35.977]  But like I said, when I went to get my driver's license, I passed the driver's safety thing.
[03:26:35.977 --> 03:26:38.897]  He said, son, don't sign that organ card.
[03:26:38.897 --> 03:26:40.077]  And I said, why?
[03:26:40.077 --> 03:26:44.298]  And he goes, well, some of the local hospitals, if you're in a car wreck or something, they'll kill you.
[03:26:44.298 --> 03:26:47.919]  They'll keep you alive and take your organs and say you were brain dead.
[03:26:47.919 --> 03:26:54.400]  And like 10 years later, I'm watching 60 Minutes at my grandparents' house in Austin in college, or out of college.
[03:26:55.905 --> 03:26:59.468]  They were showing the Dallas hospitals my dad was telling me about.
[03:26:59.468 --> 03:27:02.230]  So yeah, this is sick, my friend.
[03:27:02.230 --> 03:27:03.571]  And it is absolutely fascinating.
[03:27:03.571 --> 03:27:08.415]  You know, our editor-in-chief of Big League Politics, Patrick Kelly, likes to say that you are his Walter Cronkite.
[03:27:08.415 --> 03:27:10.737]  And I completely understand why Patrick says that.
[03:27:10.737 --> 03:27:11.718]  He's absolutely right.
[03:27:11.718 --> 03:27:12.759]  We need to get Patrick on.
[03:27:12.759 --> 03:27:14.020]  We need to get you a show here on air.
[03:27:14.020 --> 03:27:16.141]  We're trying to get the board option people hired.
[03:27:16.141 --> 03:27:18.243]  Hopefully we're getting close to that, Tom, and the great work you do.
[03:27:18.243 --> 03:27:21.206]  And KCTU5, they're in Kansas and Wichita.
[03:27:21.846 --> 03:27:24.951]  Which is a great story, not bragging, but people are hungry for the truth.
[03:27:24.951 --> 03:27:28.637]  Put us on a few years and a half ago, already gone to number one in the local ratings.
[03:27:28.637 --> 03:27:32.183]  That is very, very exciting and I thank you and the folks that were picking the show up.
[03:27:33.177 --> 03:27:34.138]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:27:34.138 --> 03:27:43.263]  Alex, it's been our pleasure, and it's been our pleasure to be one of your real flagship broadcast stations here as we enter this new digital wave of censorship.
[03:27:43.263 --> 03:27:45.485]  You know, they can't take away the FCC license.
[03:27:45.485 --> 03:27:47.686]  They may want to, but you know, it is fascinating.
[03:27:47.686 --> 03:28:01.535]  We do get people, you know, trying to hire office staff, salespeople, that type of thing, and once they find out that InfoWars is involved, either people have an amazing reaction to it, they can't wait to be a part of the team, it's the biggest moment of their lives,
[03:28:02.015 --> 03:28:08.881]  Or, again, it's this hatred, this, oh my God, you're an Alex Jones, you're a Nazi, you're a bigot, you're a racist, kill the baby.
[03:28:08.881 --> 03:28:10.662]  I mean, it just, it comes out of them.
[03:28:10.662 --> 03:28:14.506]  And some of them, we've experimented with different advertisements when we hire people.
[03:28:14.506 --> 03:28:17.929]  Sometimes we'll put, you will be representing an InfoWars TV affiliate.
[03:28:17.929 --> 03:28:19.370]  Sometimes we don't.
[03:28:19.370 --> 03:28:22.653]  When people find out, it's like an instant change.
[03:28:22.653 --> 03:28:24.194]  Their entire personality changes.
[03:28:25.720 --> 03:28:27.261]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[03:28:27.261 --> 03:28:30.142]  Tom Pappert, myself, Owen, taking over the other side.
[03:28:30.142 --> 03:28:32.183]  And then who's hosting the War Room today?
[03:28:32.183 --> 03:28:33.083]  Is it a rebroadcast?
[03:28:33.083 --> 03:28:35.204]  Who's doing the War Room at 3 o'clock, Owen?
[03:28:35.204 --> 03:28:37.365]  We got a Best Of rebroadcast today, Alex.
[03:28:37.365 --> 03:28:41.787]  So we're going to take some of our best interviews and segments from the last week and re-air them today.
[03:28:41.787 --> 03:28:45.989]  How dare you only do one live show memorial day, you traitors!
[03:28:45.989 --> 03:28:50.190]  Alright, Tom Pappert straight ahead with Owen Schroyer and Alex Jones.
[03:28:50.190 --> 03:28:50.891]  Spread those links.
[03:28:53.383 --> 03:28:54.904]  Oh, these pains.
[03:28:54.904 --> 03:28:57.425]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[03:28:57.425 --> 03:28:59.245]  I've got to get some relief.
[03:28:59.245 --> 03:29:04.948]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[03:29:04.948 --> 03:29:06.828]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[03:29:06.828 --> 03:29:08.609]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?
[03:29:08.769 --> 03:29:13.072]  Yes, with hot or cold therapy products at sunshine-pillows.com.
[03:29:13.072 --> 03:29:13.773]  Pillows?

[03:29:15.174 --> 03:29:16.655]  Oh, not just pillows.

[03:29:54.167 --> 03:29:58.289]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:29:58.289 --> 03:30:05.353]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[03:31:54.722 --> 03:32:02.109]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:32:02.109 --> 03:32:06.393]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[03:32:06.393 --> 03:32:10.116]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:32:15.765 --> 03:32:17.485]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:32:17.485 --> 03:32:18.706]  This is racketeering.
[03:32:18.706 --> 03:32:19.806]  This is cartels.
[03:32:19.806 --> 03:32:22.247]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:32:22.247 --> 03:32:24.107]  We need it now.
[03:32:24.107 --> 03:32:25.787]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:32:25.787 --> 03:32:34.750]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:32:34.750 --> 03:32:42.772]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:32:42.772 --> 03:32:43.632]  The way to fight back
[03:32:44.292 --> 03:32:49.113]  is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:32:49.113 --> 03:32:57.195]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:32:57.195 --> 03:32:59.876]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.582 --> 03:33:17.945]  Of course mama's gonna help build the wall.
[03:33:17.945 --> 03:33:27.095]  Yeah, we're smashing down those walls.
[03:33:27.095 --> 03:33:27.856]  In the mines.
[03:33:27.856 --> 03:33:34.082]  But to have our safe country where we can live our lives and have our taxes spent on us and our families, we are building the wall.
[03:33:34.082 --> 03:33:37.886]  Because the UN and the globalists are trying to destroy our country.
[03:33:39.181 --> 03:33:46.663]  The first part about freedom is standing up for yourself and saying, I'm a self-contained unit, I'm not somebody else's slave.
[03:33:46.663 --> 03:33:55.105]  Tom Pappert, Ride the Shotgun, one of those great talk show hosts, his own right, manager of KCTU5 there in the heartland of America.
[03:33:55.105 --> 03:33:58.946]  Owen Troyer, who's also from that nearby area, he's from St.
[03:33:58.946 --> 03:34:01.326]  Louis, it's Wichita, Kansas.
[03:34:01.326 --> 03:34:01.746]  He's from St.
[03:34:01.746 --> 03:34:06.107]  Louis, Missouri, but still it's near each other, is riding the shotgun.
[03:34:06.107 --> 03:34:08.288]  I want to hit some final news here before I turn it over to Tom.
[03:34:09.366 --> 03:34:15.992]  And in the war room coming up with this.
[03:34:15.992 --> 03:34:24.599]  I used to project my own humanity onto the globalists and Armenians.
[03:34:24.599 --> 03:34:30.764]  But the more I studied them, imagine how much you worry about your children if you've got children like a lot of us have.
[03:34:30.764 --> 03:34:32.825]  I've got four children.
[03:34:32.825 --> 03:34:36.709]  Imagine how much you worry about your wife when she goes out or your husband.
[03:34:36.709 --> 03:34:38.090]  Imagine how much you worry about
[03:34:39.175 --> 03:34:41.156]  People, if you care.
[03:34:41.156 --> 03:34:44.717]  Well, that gets tiring for a lot of folks, so they start not caring.
[03:34:44.717 --> 03:34:47.978]  Or maybe they never cared.
[03:34:47.978 --> 03:34:57.442]  And then instead of caring about unborn babies, you get off on the power of killing them, because you're so soulless, the only thing that excites you is evil.
[03:34:57.442 --> 03:35:03.164]  And that's what we're coming down to, that's what we're dealing with.
[03:35:03.164 --> 03:35:07.586]  You know, I've got an article here out of Yahoo News, it's pretty powerful, that we can put on screen for TV viewers.
[03:35:08.835 --> 03:35:13.637]  Everest traffic jam survivors call for tougher rules.
[03:35:13.637 --> 03:35:16.699]  Really going to put some bureaucrats up there.
[03:35:16.699 --> 03:35:21.581]  Some police officers when there are no rules in some place that inhospitable.
[03:35:21.581 --> 03:35:25.403]  Up there, you know, twenty-something thousand feet.
[03:35:25.403 --> 03:35:26.843]  There's dead bodies everywhere.
[03:35:26.843 --> 03:35:28.884]  Up to five people die a week.
[03:35:28.884 --> 03:35:29.905]  You're trying to get to the top.
[03:35:29.905 --> 03:35:36.148]  There's traffic jams.
[03:35:36.148 --> 03:35:36.808]  And then people
[03:35:38.280 --> 03:35:44.822]  are calling for the government to make it like an amusement park and make everybody safe.
[03:35:44.822 --> 03:35:50.043]  You're climbing the tallest mountain that's above sea level.
[03:35:50.043 --> 03:35:51.784]  Kona is the biggest mountain in the world.
[03:35:51.784 --> 03:35:55.205]  15,000 feet of it are out of the water.
[03:35:55.205 --> 03:35:59.246]  20-something thousand feet are under.
[03:35:59.246 --> 03:36:03.747]  Kona, the big island, is the biggest mountain in the world.
[03:36:03.747 --> 03:36:05.008]  But above sea level,
[03:36:06.047 --> 03:36:07.068]  It's K1.
[03:36:07.068 --> 03:36:09.909]  It's Mount Everest.
[03:36:09.909 --> 03:36:10.310]  Type it in.
[03:36:10.310 --> 03:36:11.170]  How many?
[03:36:11.170 --> 03:36:11.710]  Was it 23,000?
[03:36:11.710 --> 03:36:11.810]  24,000?
[03:36:11.810 --> 03:36:13.111]  I forget.
[03:36:13.111 --> 03:36:14.672]  How many feet tall is Mount Everest?
[03:36:14.672 --> 03:36:18.414]  Helicopters can't even get up to 20,000 feet.
[03:36:18.414 --> 03:36:22.116]  But the bureaucrats want people to be there and hold their hand.
[03:36:22.116 --> 03:36:26.679]  Listen, if you want 29,000 feet to the summit,
[03:36:28.547 --> 03:36:32.392]  If you want to risk your life, that's your business.
[03:36:32.392 --> 03:36:36.898]  You want to go whitewater rafting, you want to go skydiving, that's your business.
[03:36:36.898 --> 03:36:39.461]  But that's not my business.
[03:36:39.461 --> 03:36:43.946]  I'm not afraid of risking my life.
[03:36:43.946 --> 03:36:45.989]  But I'm afraid of risking it for something that doesn't matter.
[03:36:47.711 --> 03:37:16.517]  And I gotta tell you, I've been around some of these mountain climbers, I've been around some of these triathletes, and man, these guys are super awesome, and they've got themselves together, and they're alpha males, but they hardly spend time with their families, so they can go out and compete, and run 50 miles a day, or 100 miles in two days, or, so they can show off, they're not even making money, most of them, but it's about showing how great they are, and that selfishness, and I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to climb Mount Everest,
[03:37:17.475 --> 03:37:22.278]  I'm saying I think you're pathetic.
[03:37:22.278 --> 03:37:27.700]  It's one thing if nobody ever climbed it and you were the first hundred explorers, but tens of thousands have scaled its stomachs now.
[03:37:27.700 --> 03:37:29.401]  In fact, look up how many have successfully.
[03:37:29.401 --> 03:37:30.282]  I'm just going from memory.
[03:37:30.282 --> 03:37:30.782]  It's over 10,000.
[03:37:30.782 --> 03:37:31.362]  Thousands a year now?
[03:37:33.063 --> 03:37:34.243]  In fact, I pulled the article.
[03:37:34.243 --> 03:37:36.984]  There's big lines the last thousand feet.
[03:37:36.984 --> 03:37:41.665]  Everyone just waiting at the top and taking selfies that they climbed Mount Everest.
[03:37:41.665 --> 03:37:43.786]  Why don't you go help homeless kids?
[03:37:43.786 --> 03:37:46.426]  Why don't you go find a cure for cancer?
[03:37:46.426 --> 03:37:52.668]  Why don't you go do something?
[03:37:52.668 --> 03:37:55.588]  Four thousand have climbed Mount Everest.
[03:37:55.588 --> 03:37:58.509]  It's more than that now, but the point is, is that
[03:38:02.114 --> 03:38:03.555]  Can we pull up the article I mentioned?
[03:38:03.555 --> 03:38:05.136]  It's the top of Yahoo News.
[03:38:05.136 --> 03:38:09.158]  I want to show TV viewers this big line.
[03:38:09.158 --> 03:38:10.759]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:38:10.759 --> 03:38:13.340]  Hundreds and hundreds of people backed up against the top.
[03:38:13.340 --> 03:38:16.662]  What does that do?
[03:38:16.662 --> 03:38:20.824]  You'd know if you could get 200 feet from the summit that you could get there.
[03:38:22.662 --> 03:38:24.583]  That's the sense of being.
[03:38:24.583 --> 03:38:26.023]  That's the sense of achievement.
[03:38:26.023 --> 03:38:27.544]  Some people want a billion dollars.
[03:38:27.544 --> 03:38:28.705]  Some people want the trophy wife.
[03:38:28.705 --> 03:38:30.645]  Some people want to win the race car race.
[03:38:30.645 --> 03:38:32.726]  And if you're doing that and it's not your God, that's fine.
[03:38:32.726 --> 03:38:36.228]  If you're raising race car money and risking your life to do something worthy, that's great.
[03:38:36.228 --> 03:38:47.873]  But I just don't get all these committed, smart, good-looking people, black, white, old, young, who are so self-centered, it's all about some feat they can accomplish.
[03:38:48.945 --> 03:38:55.694]  Instead of the feat of building a better world, being a human, being involved, everything is so selfish.
[03:38:55.694 --> 03:38:59.539]  Tom Papert, Owen Schroeder, do you get where I'm going with this?
[03:38:59.539 --> 03:39:00.941]  They'll put all this in...
[03:39:02.350 --> 03:39:05.853]  Some of the best and smartest people we've got, but it's all about how great they are.
[03:39:05.853 --> 03:39:09.955]  And I'm all about self empowerment, but it becomes satanic.
[03:39:09.955 --> 03:39:19.222]  It becomes shit because you get around these sports people and around these climbers and around these super fitness guys, they don't give a damn about anybody but their self on average.
[03:39:19.222 --> 03:39:27.948]  And they don't put that incredible energy they've got to win the world champion arm wrestling or the NFL or whatever into humanity when we need humanity.
[03:39:29.246 --> 03:39:30.327]  Well, I'd say this.
[03:39:30.327 --> 03:39:36.711]  I think that it's kind of symbolic that line of people trying to get to the peak of Mount Everest just for their own sense of accomplishment.
[03:39:36.711 --> 03:39:40.674]  It's kind of like the line of Democrats trying to remove Trump from the peak.
[03:39:40.674 --> 03:39:44.457]  None of them are going to do it, but they're all probably going to die on their way up.
[03:39:44.457 --> 03:39:50.561]  But Alex, this is something that I realized probably too late in my life, but sooner than later is better.
[03:39:51.434 --> 03:39:57.903]  Yeah I mean you always wonder when you're a sports fan and all that stuff and I was working in sports media but it didn't really deliver anything for me.
[03:39:57.903 --> 03:40:05.533]  It was fun, it paid the bills, maybe it was you know a career but it didn't really fulfill me and so as soon as I took the red pill and I
[03:40:06.374 --> 03:40:06.694]  I think so.
[03:40:23.320 --> 03:40:23.800]  Exactly.
[03:40:23.800 --> 03:40:27.242]  Imagine the devil laughing when God gave us all this energy.
[03:40:27.242 --> 03:40:50.475]  They're climbing a 29,000-foot mountain with 100-mile winds, climbing over dead bodies to show everybody how big their ding-dong is, and they're not doing anything for humanity or to fight the leftist takeover, while drag queen story times happening and convicted pedophiles without asking parents, have your five-year-old bouncing on their crotch.
[03:40:50.475 --> 03:40:50.675]  Tom?
[03:40:51.912 --> 03:41:00.322]  You know, Alex, it really makes me think of one of the perhaps more challenging things that Christians have to struggle with, and that's putting God at the center.
[03:41:00.322 --> 03:41:01.343]  And you know, I struggle with it.
[03:41:01.343 --> 03:41:02.525]  I'm sure everybody struggles with it.
[03:41:02.525 --> 03:41:09.012]  We all get so caught up in our shows and our articles and everything that we've got to do to try to save this country and save this world.
[03:41:09.012 --> 03:41:09.273]  But...
[03:41:09.813 --> 03:41:17.239]  That is a whole lot closer than these people and it can be, Everest is a beautiful example because it's such a silly thing if you think about it.
[03:41:17.239 --> 03:41:21.182]  Look, I can walk to the top of a high surface and I can breathe the thin air and I don't die.
[03:41:21.182 --> 03:41:24.364]  Oh, congratulations, you've really achieved a lot.
[03:41:24.364 --> 03:41:26.886]  But it's a great example and there's so many people who are like this.
[03:41:26.886 --> 03:41:27.846]  Well, you just said it.
[03:41:27.846 --> 03:41:29.868]  Like Bob Dylan said, gotta serve somebody.
[03:41:29.868 --> 03:41:37.213]  They claim there isn't a God, but their God's getting to the top of a mountain and so again, they're making that their God.
[03:41:37.213 --> 03:41:37.834]  That's what you're saying.
[03:41:38.749 --> 03:41:40.090]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:41:40.090 --> 03:41:45.432]  You know, I'm a Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod Lutheran here, so they say we're baptized in vinegar.
[03:41:45.432 --> 03:41:49.434]  We're all the time looking at how sinful the world is and how terrible things are.
[03:41:49.434 --> 03:41:53.476]  But you know, when you see stuff like this, and you think, what is the matter with these people?
[03:41:53.476 --> 03:41:55.617]  They're not doing this to serve anything.
[03:41:55.617 --> 03:41:56.597]  They're not doing this to help anyone.
[03:41:56.597 --> 03:41:58.058]  Oh, it's a selfish, look how tough I am.
[03:41:58.638 --> 03:42:00.439]  They're not going to the top of the mountain to save kids.
[03:42:00.439 --> 03:42:02.320]  Look, let me tell you the opposite of Satanism.
[03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:11.506]  Was it Thailand with the 40-something kids, two miles underground, divers dying, kids dying, guys risking their total lives to go in and do that?
[03:42:11.506 --> 03:42:15.108]  That was the opposite of climbing Mount Everest.
[03:42:15.108 --> 03:42:15.708]  Right.
[03:42:15.708 --> 03:42:17.009]  And you know, they don't even think.
[03:42:17.009 --> 03:42:18.690]  You know, there are ways that you can make this.
[03:42:18.690 --> 03:42:20.551]  I mean, there were kids you gotta save at the top of the mountain.
[03:42:20.551 --> 03:42:21.211]  Do it!
[03:42:21.211 --> 03:42:23.773]  But why totally risk your life for no reason?
[03:42:24.673 --> 03:42:29.895]  You know, get somebody to donate $100,000 toward child cancer research if you make it to the top.
[03:42:29.895 --> 03:42:30.355]  Something.
[03:42:30.355 --> 03:42:32.035]  But this doesn't even cross their minds.
[03:42:32.035 --> 03:42:33.956]  No, it's just, it's all about themselves.
[03:42:33.956 --> 03:42:37.777]  It's all about their little piece of accomplishment.
[03:42:37.777 --> 03:42:39.638]  That, again, there's 4,000 names.
[03:42:39.638 --> 03:42:40.698]  I don't know five of them.
[03:42:40.698 --> 03:42:41.138]  I don't know five.
[03:42:41.138 --> 03:42:42.599]  They want to be in a club.
[03:42:42.599 --> 03:42:43.219]  Exactly.
[03:42:43.219 --> 03:42:45.020]  It's like being a trainee or whatever.
[03:42:45.020 --> 03:42:46.680]  It makes you an elite group.
[03:42:46.680 --> 03:42:48.041]  Cut your testicles off.
[03:42:48.041 --> 03:42:48.641]  We'll be right back.

[03:44:05.035 --> 03:44:13.361]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with, and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[03:44:13.361 --> 03:44:17.524]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[03:44:18.385 --> 03:44:23.993]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.

[03:44:59.859 --> 03:45:02.643]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[03:45:02.643 --> 03:45:04.646]  And the globalists are so upset.
[03:45:04.646 --> 03:45:07.469]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[03:45:08.820 --> 03:45:09.120]  That's right.

[03:46:00.082 --> 03:46:02.542]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[03:46:02.542 --> 03:46:04.503]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[03:46:04.503 --> 03:46:05.463]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[03:46:05.463 --> 03:46:05.904]  Yes, sir.
[03:46:05.904 --> 03:46:07.224]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:46:07.224 --> 03:46:09.305]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[03:46:09.305 --> 03:46:15.247]  I have InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[03:46:15.247 --> 03:46:17.187]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[03:46:17.187 --> 03:46:18.168]  God bless you, brother.
[03:46:18.168 --> 03:46:24.770]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[03:46:25.150 --> 03:46:26.251]  You're our only hope, brother.
[03:46:26.251 --> 03:46:28.572]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[03:46:28.572 --> 03:46:31.313]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[03:46:56.768 --> 03:46:59.359]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.018 --> 03:47:09.179]  You've found it.
[03:47:09.179 --> 03:47:11.200]  The tip of the spear.
[03:47:11.200 --> 03:47:14.703]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.703 --> 03:47:22.048]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[03:47:22.048 --> 03:47:24.110]  Harping on the war as we fight.
[03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:28.714]  Harping on the war as we fight and griping about the way things ought to be.
[03:47:28.714 --> 03:47:30.315]  It's hard to turn off Merle Haggard, isn't it?
[03:47:31.800 --> 03:47:38.082]  I want to finish up with Tom Papert and Owen Schroer, but let me add one more little dessert or addendum to what I said.
[03:47:38.082 --> 03:47:40.622]  Is it satanic to climb Mount Everest?
[03:47:40.622 --> 03:47:42.683]  And I don't think the answer is yes.
[03:47:42.683 --> 03:47:44.303]  It's in all of our hearts what we do.
[03:47:44.303 --> 03:47:46.724]  And the first people to do it, I get it.
[03:47:46.724 --> 03:47:48.484]  But now it's 4,000 plus.
[03:47:48.484 --> 03:47:51.345]  Now there's all these books out about billionaires doing it.
[03:47:51.345 --> 03:47:53.786]  And it becomes a ding-dong measuring contest.
[03:47:54.426 --> 03:48:05.960]  When all these hundreds are backed up every day trying to get to the top and everybody's bitching and complaining and they want traffic guards up at the... Imagine if these people put that energy into other things in their lives.
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:08.002]  Imagine how much better the world would be.
[03:48:08.002 --> 03:48:10.725]  I'm not saying take away their right to go up there.
[03:48:10.725 --> 03:48:14.069]  I don't want to pay for helicoptering their dead bodies off.
[03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:21.274]  Just like you want to go to some doctor and have your Johnson and your Wavos cut off, knock yourself out, man.
[03:48:21.274 --> 03:48:22.935]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:48:22.935 --> 03:48:26.376]  The mentally ill people want to cut their fingers off and jump off bridges.
[03:48:26.376 --> 03:48:30.939]  As long as you don't hurt somebody, I'm sad for you, but do it.
[03:48:30.939 --> 03:48:31.619]  I'm a libertarian.
[03:48:31.619 --> 03:48:34.281]  You want to get a bunch of heroin and kill yourself, that's your business.
[03:48:34.281 --> 03:48:39.624]  I don't want to pay for you to go to the top of mountains or cut your ding-a-ling off.
[03:48:39.624 --> 03:48:41.705]  And, you know, I hope you won't do it.
[03:48:42.622 --> 03:48:50.784]  But all I'm saying is, it's getting sick when they bitch and complain in the news about how there's traffic jams going to the top of this mountain.
[03:48:50.784 --> 03:48:51.844]  It gets sick.
[03:48:51.844 --> 03:48:53.205]  I love rugged individualism.
[03:48:53.205 --> 03:48:54.465]  I love trailblazing.
[03:48:54.465 --> 03:49:01.147]  Lewis and Clark were risking their lives, but they were getting a western passage to the Pacific Ocean for a reason.
[03:49:01.147 --> 03:49:06.148]  They were risking their lives to do something new, not to prove how tough they were.
[03:49:07.932 --> 03:49:14.539]  Now let's shift gears with Tom Papert, great manager at KCTU5 in Wichita, Kansas, that carries us.
[03:49:14.539 --> 03:49:19.303]  Huawei CEO says China shouldn't punish Apple.
[03:49:19.303 --> 03:49:23.207]  Boy, I saw that CNN headline this morning and I knew I was going to read.
[03:49:23.207 --> 03:49:25.670]  Apple has become state-run a year ago.
[03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:27.712]  They moved to China over a year ago.
[03:49:27.712 --> 03:49:28.833]  They're with the Communist Party.
[03:49:30.168 --> 03:49:31.628]  Huawei's Communist Party run.
[03:49:31.628 --> 03:49:32.969]  It's spying on all the devices.
[03:49:32.969 --> 03:49:34.049]  It's getting banned all over the world.
[03:49:34.049 --> 03:49:35.209]  They got caught.
[03:49:35.209 --> 03:49:36.810]  So CNN has this pup piece out.
[03:49:36.810 --> 03:49:40.110]  Trump's meme for the poor little baby Huawei.
[03:49:40.110 --> 03:49:43.131]  So now his teacher is Apple.
[03:49:43.131 --> 03:49:49.553]  Even though he's about to replace Apple sales in Europe and in Asia and what they call Greater China, Taiwan.
[03:49:49.553 --> 03:49:51.313]  It's all Qaicom written.
[03:49:52.912 --> 03:50:02.862]  He's like, oh don't mess with Apple, because it's Chai Com run now too, and they've got the code keys, and they admit they're spying on you through Apple just as bad as Huawei!
[03:50:02.862 --> 03:50:10.069]  So he's like, oh, we don't want to kick them out of China, or, oh no, Apple, good.
[03:50:10.069 --> 03:50:12.872]  Good, Apple.
[03:50:12.872 --> 03:50:15.215]  This is sick.
[03:50:15.215 --> 03:50:16.356]  He thinks you're a moron.
[03:50:17.779 --> 03:50:19.480]  Daughters in prison right now.
[03:50:19.480 --> 03:50:24.585]  China State TV carries Daily Show, spot on Huawei lead in 5G.
[03:50:24.585 --> 03:50:33.632]  So don't worry, the Daily Show, pissing all over America, it's on in China, but they don't want anything else from the West Air there.
[03:50:33.632 --> 03:50:36.295]  Again, shy, calm propaganda.
[03:50:36.295 --> 03:50:37.496]  Tom Papert, unbelievable.
[03:50:38.834 --> 03:50:45.898]  The Daily Show wants us off air, cheers it, has celebrations, so do the other big so-called comedians, who are really just fake news.
[03:50:45.898 --> 03:51:06.290]  But the Chinese government's funding six of the big eight Hollywood production houses, and they're funding, on record, the major production operations, like the folks over at Netflix, and now they are openly involved, airing The Daily Show.
[03:51:07.031 --> 03:51:12.125]  When you know the Communist Chinese have approved of The Daily Show, you know The Daily Show is really bad news.
[03:51:13.533 --> 03:51:21.917]  You know, it does actually relate really well to what we were talking about in the last segment, because China, the elite people in China, their god is power.
[03:51:21.917 --> 03:51:24.898]  And then you've got Tim Cook, his god is money.
[03:51:24.898 --> 03:51:35.183]  He thinks that if he merges his company with China, then oh boy, we're going to get billions of new people who will all buy an iPhone and an iPad and it'll just be wonderful and we'll make so much money.
[03:51:35.183 --> 03:51:36.824]  Who needs those stupid Americans?
[03:51:36.824 --> 03:51:40.566]  There's only 350 million of them and another 30, 40 million illegals.
[03:51:40.566 --> 03:51:42.066]  That's chump change.
[03:51:42.066 --> 03:51:43.187]  We're going to China.
[03:51:43.547 --> 03:51:47.250]  And so he's essentially sacrificing his soul to China.
[03:51:47.250 --> 03:51:49.632]  Same exact thing with these Hollywood production houses.
[03:51:49.632 --> 03:51:53.715]  They're not concerned about what Americans want to see when they go to the theater.
[03:51:53.715 --> 03:51:55.537]  We're a relatively small audience.
[03:51:55.537 --> 03:52:04.044]  They want to be one of the two or three or four American movies that gets brought into China so they can get all of those box office sales.
[03:52:04.044 --> 03:52:08.748]  And again, they don't want people like you, Alex, because you're the one sitting there saying, wait a minute.
[03:52:09.288 --> 03:52:19.239]  You are selling your soul to the devil for a couple bucks, selling your country down the line, selling it out, ruining everything the West was built on, everything America was built on.
[03:52:19.239 --> 03:52:20.880]  Tom, let me go further than that.
[03:52:20.880 --> 03:52:22.142]  Let me go further than that.
[03:52:22.142 --> 03:52:25.525]  It's not just me up here saying this and I'm something special.
[03:52:26.266 --> 03:52:29.308]  Communist China has killed way more than Hitler ever killed.
[03:52:29.308 --> 03:52:30.448]  They're totally soulless.
[03:52:30.448 --> 03:52:31.689]  They feed on their own people.
[03:52:31.689 --> 03:52:32.890]  Slave factories.
[03:52:32.890 --> 03:52:38.473]  And then Tim Cook, who owns the worst factories under Foxconn in China, says, I'm dangerous and deplorable.
[03:52:38.473 --> 03:52:39.854]  I need to be banned from the web.
[03:52:39.854 --> 03:52:41.595]  He has no moral standing.
[03:52:41.595 --> 03:52:42.676]  He's out of control.
[03:52:42.676 --> 03:52:43.176]  Owen Schroer.
[03:52:44.687 --> 03:52:52.932]  Well, I'm just amazed that anybody wants to air The Daily Show with that guy who's not even funny.
[03:52:52.932 --> 03:52:58.496]  These comedy special nightly shows haven't been funny in years, as far as I'm concerned.
[03:52:58.496 --> 03:53:02.278]  So I think it really just goes to show you they want the anti-Trump propaganda in there.
[03:53:02.278 --> 03:53:03.819]  It's not even about entertainment.
[03:53:03.819 --> 03:53:10.123]  I mean, hell, we could do a comedy bit right now without teleprompters and it'd be funnier than anything The Daily Show ever did.
[03:53:11.223 --> 03:53:19.846]  But, you know, I do want to point this out too, because I think it is the same kind of attack on our humanity, and I know it's a totally different subject, but there may be a connection here.
[03:53:19.846 --> 03:53:25.648]  Sex robot threat, AI girlfriends indistinguishable from humans after major 5G upgrade.
[03:53:26.728 --> 03:53:31.913]  So, first of all, to say that you can't tell a robot from a human is obviously fake news.
[03:53:31.913 --> 03:53:33.574]  But that's the whole point.
[03:53:33.574 --> 03:53:35.155]  Well, what's the difference?
[03:53:35.155 --> 03:53:35.876]  It's a robot.
[03:53:35.876 --> 03:53:36.877]  It's taking care of you.
[03:53:36.877 --> 03:53:38.718]  And they teach the women to hate men.
[03:53:38.718 --> 03:53:42.901]  And, you know, like the new Blade Runner, oh, he's in love with his virtual girlfriend.
[03:53:42.901 --> 03:53:45.443]  So the virtual girlfriend will tell you whatever you want to hear.
[03:53:45.443 --> 03:53:48.326]  Just like Japan, the men aren't even having wives anymore.
[03:53:48.326 --> 03:53:51.228]  It's the end of humanity as we know it.
[03:53:51.228 --> 03:53:52.069]  And I don't feel fine.
[03:53:52.952 --> 03:53:55.053]  So I just wanted to put that out there before we sign off.
[03:53:55.053 --> 03:53:59.114]  But there's going to be a lot to get to the rest of the way this week, Alex.
[03:53:59.114 --> 03:54:01.936]  There's going to be some social media news coming out.
[03:54:01.936 --> 03:54:06.037]  There's going to be some interesting, I think, debates about foreign invasions happening, too.
[03:54:06.037 --> 03:54:09.779]  We got a private wall that just went up in New Mexico.
[03:54:09.779 --> 03:54:12.099]  So it's going to be a crazy broadcast week here.
[03:54:12.099 --> 03:54:15.841]  And let's not forget, Alex, that Trump is moving against the treasonous Deep State.
[03:54:16.291 --> 03:54:16.831]  That's right.
[03:54:16.831 --> 03:54:17.871]  Eric Prince of all people.
[03:54:17.871 --> 03:54:19.712]  Let's play the clip since you mentioned it.
[03:54:19.712 --> 03:54:27.554]  Eric Prince of Blackwater fame is actually financing a wall, a private wall.
[03:54:27.554 --> 03:54:31.336]  We build the wall in New Mexico where everything is collapsing.
[03:54:31.336 --> 03:54:42.119]  Here's a clip of that.
[03:54:42.119 --> 03:54:46.200]  Look, since Prince is involved, all this fancy is working just fine.
[03:54:49.212 --> 03:54:50.473]  Radio listeners are missing this.
[03:54:50.473 --> 03:55:02.903]  It's at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:55:02.903 --> 03:55:07.446]  Lux Hawks bottom line, Tom Pappert, this country is under globalist attack.
[03:55:07.446 --> 03:55:08.988]  I have a stack of news right here.
[03:55:09.867 --> 03:55:19.894]  Where New Mexico that's run by a leftist says, oh my god, get here, help us, millions are pouring across, holy hell, just a few months ago she was making jokes.
[03:55:19.894 --> 03:55:25.698]  Look, Trump doesn't have the courts, he doesn't have the troops, he doesn't have anything, so I'm glad he's going to bust into leftist areas.
[03:55:25.698 --> 03:55:31.122]  I'm not glad they're here, but at least this is showing the dumbass left what it's like in red states.
[03:55:32.329 --> 03:55:36.592]  That's absolutely right, and it's the opposite of what Obama did during all his eight years.
[03:55:36.592 --> 03:55:38.253]  He wanted to put them in the red states.
[03:55:38.253 --> 03:55:45.557]  That's why we have the Hamas caucus in Congress now, because you put enough Somali refugees there, and suddenly they vote one of their own in.
[03:55:45.557 --> 03:55:48.139]  I mean, it is refreshing to see the pressure apply.
[03:55:48.139 --> 03:55:52.182]  We love our Somalis, we love our Muslims too.
[03:55:52.182 --> 03:55:52.422]  Sorry.
[03:55:53.277 --> 03:55:56.458]  You're gonna stab your daughter at the mall, and that's exactly where that happened!
[03:55:56.458 --> 03:55:59.019]  I mean, it's... We laughed, and it was funny, and that's where it happened!
[03:55:59.019 --> 03:56:00.580]  Gonna throw your white baby off the mall!
[03:56:00.580 --> 03:56:00.660]  Woo!
[03:56:00.660 --> 03:56:02.841]  Throw that baby off the mall!
[03:56:02.841 --> 03:56:04.421]  Woo!
[03:56:04.421 --> 03:56:06.382]  Watch baby's head hit the ground!
[03:56:06.382 --> 03:56:07.542]  Woo!
[03:56:07.542 --> 03:56:12.184]  And the police chief's gonna say, we love our Somalis!
[03:56:12.184 --> 03:56:14.325]  We love our Muslims too!
[03:56:14.325 --> 03:56:15.466]  Oh, they're so good!
[03:56:15.466 --> 03:56:16.206]  Oh, they're so sweet!
[03:56:16.206 --> 03:56:16.566]  Sorry, Tom.
[03:56:17.384 --> 03:56:19.985]  No, it's completely true and it's completely accurate.
[03:56:19.985 --> 03:56:30.348]  And so it is nice to see this type of pressure that was being put against the red states now being applied to these globalist hellholes in the left coast and the left southern portion of the country.
[03:56:30.348 --> 03:56:35.890]  I enjoy it and I hope that they really see what they've done to this country up close and personal.
[03:56:35.890 --> 03:56:37.070]  It's exciting.
[03:56:37.070 --> 03:56:38.111]  Tom, great job.
[03:56:38.111 --> 03:56:38.891]  Owen, great job.
[03:56:38.891 --> 03:56:42.752]  War Room coming up in just a few minutes at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:56:42.752 --> 03:56:44.093]  Thanks for our affiliates.
[03:56:44.093 --> 03:56:44.933]  Ladies and gentlemen,

[03:56:56.648 --> 03:56:57.628]  I want more reporters.
[03:56:57.628 --> 03:56:58.928]  I want more crew.
[03:56:58.928 --> 03:57:03.070]  I want to watch all the leftist publications that are trying to shut us down, go bankrupt.
[03:57:03.070 --> 03:57:03.890]  I don't want to shut them down.
[03:57:03.890 --> 03:57:06.571]  I just love seeing them be shut down that nobody believes them.
[03:57:06.571 --> 03:57:08.311]  But we need money to do that.
[03:57:08.311 --> 03:57:11.012]  And folks, we've got the vitamin mineral fusion.

[03:57:43.553 --> 03:57:54.619]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[03:57:54.619 --> 03:58:03.484]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[03:58:03.484 --> 03:58:07.487]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[03:58:08.167 --> 03:58:14.594]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[03:58:14.594 --> 03:58:16.816]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
[03:58:16.816 --> 03:58:22.742]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy-Powder.

[03:58:44.321 --> 03:58:47.924]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:58:47.924 --> 03:58:49.686]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:58:49.686 --> 03:59:00.955]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:59:01.736 --> 03:59:10.921]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:59:10.921 --> 03:59:21.466]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:59:21.966 --> 03:59:24.587]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:59:24.587 --> 03:59:26.308]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:59:26.308 --> 03:59:36.294]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:59:36.294 --> 03:59:38.955]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[03:59:38.955 --> 03:59:47.700]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:59:47.700 --> 03:59:50.402]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
