[00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.798]  Just on the opposite side from the main closet in front of it.
[00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:23.656]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:37.488]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he has been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.841]  He predicted 9-11.
[00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:48.786]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:52.728]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:07.701]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[00:01:08.322 --> 00:01:12.946]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group at all.
[00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:22.334]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:26.117]  They falsely edited him.
[00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:31.157]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[00:01:32.097 --> 00:01:36.921]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[00:01:38.722 --> 00:01:43.205]  And now he is being deplatformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:49.189]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.651]  And then we get hit and say, you don't want to use our software.
[00:01:52.902 --> 00:01:55.765]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[00:01:56.266 --> 00:01:57.527]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[00:01:57.888 --> 00:01:58.708]  They just killed our stream.
[00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.270]  Really?
[00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.651]  Yep.
[00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:03.333]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:06.777]  This is America in 2018.
[00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:14.586]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[00:02:16.818 --> 00:02:20.779]  Will you do nothing while history is being recorded?
[00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.980]  Will you sit and do nothing?
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.523]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[00:02:31.703 --> 00:02:36.645]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:04.698]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:07.659]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.300]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.940]  Well, these are the times that try men and women's souls.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.781]  I'm here to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna really try to do the very best job I can for you today.
[00:03:29.282 --> 00:03:33.383]  I talk a lot about things that I call skeleton keys or Rosetta Stones.
[00:03:35.103 --> 00:03:40.105]  Basically, events that if you understand those events, you understand the big picture.
[00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:44.046]  Beyond teachable moments.
[00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:47.887]  And this whole Notre Dame fire
[00:03:49.065 --> 00:04:04.070]  As I watched it burn while we were on the air yesterday, and almost completely destroyed, just a husk of the historic, beautiful, 900-plus-year-old building left, built in the 1100s, I wasn't even thinking political things at the time.
[00:04:04.971 --> 00:04:07.771]  But obviously, we said, could it be arson?
[00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:08.792]  Could it be construction?
[00:04:09.052 --> 00:04:14.214]  But for them to say we think it's construction in the first hour of the blaze, that's suspicious.
[00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.810]  An RV park burns down.
[00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:30.413]  You know, I had a old bus and we used it occasionally and it was at a covered RV facility and a few months ago it burned down.
[00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:38.295]  There's still a criminal investigation of that big fire in North Austin that burned up over 200 boats and RVs.
[00:04:39.496 --> 00:04:40.676]  There's still a criminal investigation.
[00:04:42.506 --> 00:04:51.511]  But oh my gosh, we're not supposed to investigate this day one when 800 plus churches have been burnt up or blown up in France alone in the last 12 months.
[00:04:52.471 --> 00:04:56.093]  And ISIS, by the way, is pretty much taking responsibility for it.
[00:04:56.113 --> 00:04:57.794]  But don't you dare even question.
[00:04:57.854 --> 00:04:58.034]  Nope.
[00:04:58.194 --> 00:05:00.355]  Open and shut before the fire's even out.
[00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:01.596]  Nothing to see here.
[00:05:01.636 --> 00:05:02.136]  Move along.
[00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:09.580]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.861]  Our most advanced formula yet.
[00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:25.912]  DNA Force Plus is focused on overhauling your body's cellular engines and supporting your optimal energy levels while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[00:05:28.764 --> 00:05:37.308]  DNA Force Plus contains a combination of the best adaptogens on the market to help your body adapt and bend, not break.
[00:05:37.828 --> 00:05:42.271]  Hand-picked adaptogen herbs help protect your body on a cellular level.
[00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:49.054]  It's time to try the newest version of one of our most powerful formulas yet with DNA Force Plus.
[00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:58.468]  Available at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:06:08.558 --> 00:06:12.581]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com frontline report.
[00:06:15.144 --> 00:06:19.048]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:35.196]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.782 --> 00:06:49.446]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Tuesday, April 16, 2019 global broadcast.
[00:06:49.506 --> 00:06:51.367]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:55.094 --> 00:07:10.442]  Obviously the tragic fire of a very important historic Christian site in Europe, in what's left of Islamic-occupied France, burned, not to the ground, but into an empty husk to a great extent.
[00:07:11.563 --> 00:07:16.365]  And we are seeing the incredible response by European news, U.S.
[00:07:16.445 --> 00:07:23.849]  news, even Fox News, of trying to take anyone offline that says it should be investigated for arson.
[00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:27.929]  Well, under French law, under EU law, under U.S.
[00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:29.010]  law, under U.K.
[00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.394]  law, under common law, any big fire is investigated.
[00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:48.466]  But Shep Smith and Caputo and all the rest on Fox, when they have head of the Catholic League on or a French government official on, saying, well, actually, we don't know if this was
[00:07:49.605 --> 00:07:50.306]  Just construction.
[00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:51.487]  That's just being put out by the news.
[00:07:52.528 --> 00:07:53.408]  It may have been arson.
[00:07:53.428 --> 00:07:56.211]  We've had 800 churches burn in the last 12 months.
[00:07:58.413 --> 00:08:01.135]  Shep Smith shuts it down.
[00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:05.599]  You can see the video at Infowars.com and Newswars.com and a Jamie Smith article.
[00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:06.159]  It's very important.
[00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:07.881]  This is disgusting behavior.
[00:08:08.341 --> 00:08:11.284]  Meanwhile, France is the main epicenter.
[00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.805]  Thousands of cars burned a month.
[00:08:14.046 --> 00:08:17.069]  People screaming Allah Akbar and they're on a jihad.
[00:08:18.953 --> 00:08:30.582]  The UN reports that there have been, in Europe, 1,063 churches attacked or burned down or defaced that have been reported.
[00:08:31.583 --> 00:08:33.605]  And most of those are in France.
[00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:41.992]  And I've got the report here where the UN reports that Christianity is the most persecuted religion in the world.
[00:08:42.692 --> 00:08:46.896]  So, you can't have churches in the Middle East.
[00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:57.605]  used to be Christian but Islam came along 1400 years ago and so whether it's in Egypt or whether it is in
[00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:00.585]  Places like Iraq.
[00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:04.547]  You can't have a church because they'll firebomb you or suicide bomb you.
[00:09:04.987 --> 00:09:21.373]  And then in places where you supposedly can be Christian, like Egypt, that was formerly almost 100% Christian just a few hundred years ago, or in places like Syria, if you try to show up for Easter or Christmas or Palm Sunday, you get blown up again by a truck bomb.
[00:09:23.053 --> 00:09:27.775]  And when I cover that, they have mainstream media writing articles saying Jones is making up
[00:09:29.005 --> 00:09:30.546]  That Islam attacks churches.
[00:09:30.606 --> 00:09:37.009]  It's like saying, Jones is making it up that foxes will try to get in a hen house and eat chickens.
[00:09:38.009 --> 00:09:41.231]  Or Jones is making it up that great white sharks like to eat seals.
[00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:42.251]  No, I'm not.
[00:09:44.612 --> 00:09:46.153]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:54.617]  ISIS has pledged on Palm Sunday and on the days leading up to Easter, as I said, what, a few months ago,
[00:09:56.044 --> 00:09:58.905]  I said, Islam is attacking churches all over the world.
[00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:06.726]  And I said, Islam has said on Palm Sunday through Easter, they're going to burn up and bomb churches.
[00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:07.547]  And guess what?
[00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.887]  They said just last week, we're going to blow up more churches in France.
[00:10:12.908 --> 00:10:16.189]  ISIS had a public plot to blow up Notre Dame.
[00:10:18.369 --> 00:10:21.310]  But the talking point has gone out that you don't let them talk about it.
[00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.610]  In fact, just what three weeks ago,
[00:10:23.885 --> 00:10:41.531]  When we saw the Christchurch mosque attacked, I said, the media won't cover it when we see churches being firebombed and blown up and shot up, or Islamists running over people with cars or trucks, screaming, Allah Akbar!
[00:10:45.532 --> 00:10:50.994]  And now, you've got Easter week, and you know you're gonna see more churches torched.
[00:10:51.835 --> 00:10:52.755]  You know you're gonna see
[00:10:55.615 --> 00:10:56.656]  Cars running people over.
[00:10:56.696 --> 00:10:58.718]  You know you're going to see churches blown up and shot up.
[00:10:59.138 --> 00:11:06.404]  And they're going to try every time to say it wasn't Islam, even though you're going to hear, Allah Akbar!
[00:11:06.744 --> 00:11:09.246]  Now, maybe this is construction at Notre Dame.
[00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:18.834]  Maybe it is, but when you suddenly have the head of the Catholic League being cut off Fox News for saying, we should look at Islamic terror.
[00:11:18.854 --> 00:11:20.015]  There have been a lot of threats.
[00:11:23.498 --> 00:11:24.079]  And you've got
[00:11:25.134 --> 00:11:29.837]  Government officials in France on Fox News have been kicked off, and all their channels are doing the same thing.
[00:11:30.098 --> 00:11:32.559]  They're saying there's no way Islam ever touched a church.
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:44.308]  No, they just drive Christians out of wherever they live, whether it be North Africa, Central Africa, Western Africa, Eastern Africa, whether it be East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia.
[00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:45.949]  I mean, my God!
[00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.253]  The Muslims have been trying to take over India for 1,200 years since they got there.
[00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:59.617]  Took them a few hundred years to get there, and they've killed reportedly a hundred and forty-five million Hindus and Buddhists, it's estimated.
[00:12:01.038 --> 00:12:06.021]  In fact, until then, the Buddhist people really weren't even training in warfare until the Muslims showed up.
[00:12:06.241 --> 00:12:08.142]  That's where you get Kung Fu and all that.
[00:12:09.443 --> 00:12:13.546]  Was the, was the Buddhist and the Hindu said, okay, let's get weapons, let's get trained.
[00:12:13.786 --> 00:12:15.327]  Where do you think the Sikhs come from?
[00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:18.963]  Arch enemies of radical Islam and orthodox Islam.
[00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:31.533]  And of course it's always some redneck dumbass in a real hate attack who goes in a liquor store or a gas station or to Sikh temple and shoots 20, 30 people thinking they're Muslims because they're wearing turbans and have brown skin.
[00:12:31.854 --> 00:12:35.597]  It's a religious sect to fight Muslims, you morons!
[00:12:36.958 --> 00:12:45.505]  One of the only real white on brown organized attacks I keep seeing is dumb white people
[00:12:47.418 --> 00:12:48.279]  Not all white folks are bad.
[00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:48.900]  I'm not saying that.
[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.444]  I'm saying the left's always making stuff about the whites doing this, whites doing that.
[00:12:52.464 --> 00:12:58.110]  But the only real terror crimes I see on a routine basis is...
[00:13:00.299 --> 00:13:02.680]  There's been some black people attack them too, and some Hispanics.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.961]  The point is, folks see that big turban and they think that's a Muslim.
[00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:16.166]  No, that is a Hindu military order to defend Hindus from 145 million of them being murdered.
[00:13:16.726 --> 00:13:17.466]  Murdered.
[00:13:17.486 --> 00:13:20.928]  There were no Muslims 1,400 years ago.
[00:13:23.908 --> 00:13:24.328]  In India.
[00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:26.430]  Now what are they, 37% of the population?
[00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:31.555]  And most experts agree if a real World War 4 ever breaks out, it's going to be between India and Pakistan.
[00:13:32.256 --> 00:13:34.038]  Hell, they were just bombing each other a month ago.
[00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:37.421]  So imagine this, we'll come back and play all the clips.
[00:13:38.963 --> 00:13:47.271]  You've got government officials, the head of the Catholic League, others saying, ISIS and others said they were going to target Notre Dame, which I've got the articles they did, just a week ago.
[00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:51.871]  And then you've got Muslims celebrating and doing selfies and smiling.
[00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:53.111]  Paul Watson wrote about it.
[00:13:53.211 --> 00:14:17.204]  And BuzzFeed, the kings of fake news, the kings of fake Russian dossiers and PPGate, they came out and said Infowars.com and Summit.news, Paul's great site, were fake news, even though there's video, video on Paul's article and images of the people celebrating en masse and doing selfies.
[00:14:18.308 --> 00:14:19.210]  With it burning.
[00:14:20.071 --> 00:14:22.294]  BuzzFeed caught a huge lie about Notre Dame fire.
[00:14:22.855 --> 00:14:27.944]  Claims video showing people reacting with smiley emojis was a hoax.
[00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:32.271]  When it was completely legitimate, many of them prominent leftist professors.
[00:14:34.845 --> 00:14:37.046]  Weird, self-loathing Jews.
[00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:39.707]  There's a bunch of leftist Jews in there.
[00:14:39.727 --> 00:14:43.169]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:14:44.009 --> 00:14:45.330]  Same Jews that want to get rid of Israel.
[00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.851]  It's just whack, job-level, nutsoid.
[00:14:50.332 --> 00:14:53.774]  So when we come back, Shep Smith, Caputo, all of them on Fox News.
[00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:55.655]  You don't bring that up!
[00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:58.576]  There's no way Islam ever armed to fly.
[00:15:00.029 --> 00:15:01.129]  They didn't harm a flea.
[00:15:01.149 --> 00:15:03.510]  They didn't hurt a hair on anybody's head.
[00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:05.111]  Islam is a religion of peace.
[00:15:05.811 --> 00:15:06.912]  They hand out flowers.
[00:15:07.632 --> 00:15:23.399]  And don't you and the big Islamic command base of Paris, where they've already burned up and blown up a bunch of churches and run over people with cars by the hundreds and stabbed people and shot people and attacked rock bands and murdered in mass and everything else, screaming Allah Akbar.
[00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:29.560]  Don't you dare say radical Islam even exists, because Shep Smith says it doesn't.
[00:15:29.861 --> 00:15:35.022]  And you don't, even before the fires are out, question that it could have been arsoned by anybody.
[00:15:36.342 --> 00:15:46.785]  You've heard the official story, not from the fire department, but you've heard it from Fox News, who's taking a big, giant turn to the left as the globalists panic and think they can't beat Trump.
[00:15:48.533 --> 00:15:51.474]  Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders, fury at Fox News for hosting Bernie.
[00:15:51.854 --> 00:15:53.915]  Audience cheers, Medicaid for all!
[00:15:54.315 --> 00:15:55.796]  Everybody wants some free stuff!
[00:15:56.316 --> 00:15:58.537]  And Bernie is ready to do it!
[00:15:59.137 --> 00:16:00.538]  Oh, he attacked him four once, by the way.
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:13.804]  I want to put forward an allegory, or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current, real-time reality.
[00:16:14.244 --> 00:16:16.685]  So please, bear with me a few minutes.
[00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:23.789]  Because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[00:16:24.469 --> 00:16:25.189]  Well, I'll explain.
[00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.912]  Our listeners, our viewers, are what Infowars really is.
[00:16:31.612 --> 00:16:38.655]  A populist, free market, pro-human movement that has detonated awakenings and resistance all over the world.
[00:16:39.496 --> 00:16:42.557]  We are the big giant tsunami coming in against globalist tyranny.
[00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.779]  You really are kicking globalist ass on every level.
[00:16:47.438 --> 00:16:47.898]  They're panicked.
[00:16:48.859 --> 00:16:50.721]  They thought that they had already won.
[00:16:52.362 --> 00:17:15.362]  But if they can still use corporate media to attack the leaders of the resistance to globalism, and if they can strip us of who we really are, and then put banners on us like a NASCAR, and claim that we support racism, or we support abusing women, or we support all these things we don't support, they can win.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:26.054]  That's why it's important to strip it all away, what they've claimed, what they've said, the straw men they've built, and to tell people what you really stand for.
[00:17:27.015 --> 00:17:31.922]  But in this world of thousands and thousands of channels and millions of hosts,
[00:17:33.035 --> 00:17:34.735]  The truth gets drowned out sometimes.
[00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:36.316]  That's what the globalists are hoping is going to happen.
[00:17:36.816 --> 00:17:41.717]  But out of all the shows and all the broadcasts out there, it's this show particularly they fear.
[00:17:42.357 --> 00:17:47.598]  Because we don't go off the pop culture they put out, we go off what they actually say and what they actually stand for.
[00:17:49.018 --> 00:17:55.739]  Now I was thinking, as 2018 ended, now four months ago, I was thinking, what have I dropped the ball on?
[00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:58.579]  What's one area in the info where we haven't been effective?
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.340]  Where we were effective previously?
[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:01.420]  And that's
[00:18:02.834 --> 00:18:04.156]  Wearing our flags openly.
[00:18:05.057 --> 00:18:07.980]  Wearing our colors openly.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:10.702]  And it starts with not being ashamed of the American flag that's under attack.
[00:18:10.863 --> 00:18:13.005]  The official Democrats want to remove it.
[00:18:13.906 --> 00:18:18.491]  Want to take Thomas Jefferson off the money, saying he was a racist.
[00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:20.473]  I mean, they're even assaulting the flag now.
[00:18:20.573 --> 00:18:25.158]  So, they're projecting all their lies onto our great symbol and its great history.
[00:18:26.411 --> 00:18:31.453]  So first we have to strip away the lies they've put on us, like logos.
[00:18:32.213 --> 00:18:41.917]  Racist, homophobe, anti-female, criminal, hoaxer, when they're the ones that are really doing all that.
[00:18:42.698 --> 00:18:49.100]  And then we have to display to everyone what we actually stand for, what we actually believe in.
[00:18:49.581 --> 00:18:52.142]  America and the world is already in a civil war.
[00:18:53.311 --> 00:18:55.033]  Pro-humans against the globalists.
[00:18:55.493 --> 00:18:58.377]  We have to wear our colors loud and proud.
[00:18:58.797 --> 00:19:01.340]  And this is the best-seller right now of the last year.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.783]  The Info Wars In Your Face.
[00:19:04.564 --> 00:19:08.768]  You know, I said to listeners, I said, hey, we've got Molon Labe, or we've got other shirts.
[00:19:08.788 --> 00:19:10.490]  We just want to meet like-minded people.
[00:19:11.751 --> 00:19:16.954]  But this shirt particularly, ladies and gentlemen, will really get in their face.
[00:19:17.354 --> 00:19:21.456]  And again, you'll get way more thumbs up and high fives and shake hands and meet friends.
[00:19:22.076 --> 00:19:27.479]  But there is that 1% or so out of the 100 people that see you that will say, F you, Russian Asian.
[00:19:27.939 --> 00:19:28.479]  F you, traitor.
[00:19:28.539 --> 00:19:30.260]  But again, those are pathetic bots.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.342]  And they want to intimidate you to not exercise your free speech.
[00:19:35.402 --> 00:19:36.763]  So don't let them.
[00:19:36.863 --> 00:19:38.664]  Don't ever back down to their tyranny.
[00:19:39.424 --> 00:19:43.188]  This week only, we're running the biggest sell ever on t-shirts across the board.

[00:19:58.522 --> 00:20:02.206]  Loud, pro-America, pro-freedom, and in the bullies' faces.
[00:20:06.514 --> 00:20:10.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.127 --> 00:20:20.214]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:36.459]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide from the ATX.
[00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:37.780]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.203]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com are the websites.
[00:20:41.303 --> 00:20:58.998]  Okay, so we have a whole stack of articles here from the Guardian, from the Associated Press, from Wikipedia, from the New York Post about bombing attacks, terror attacks, attempted attacks on Notre Dame last year.
[00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:06.026]  We have ISIS just last week saying we're going to target churches in Europe over Palm Sunday through Easter.
[00:21:06.626 --> 00:21:12.148]  And of course, we've had a thousand plus churches firebombed or attacked in just last year in Europe.
[00:21:13.948 --> 00:21:18.569]  Everybody knows that thousands of cars a month get burned all over Europe by Muslims.
[00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:28.052]  And of course, even the Daily Beast has to report an ISIS plot to blow up Notre Dame Cathedral and rule the world.
[00:21:28.072 --> 00:21:30.013]  And of course, they make jokes about it.
[00:21:31.138 --> 00:21:35.200]  Because they're there to make sure we don't get warned about what's happening.
[00:21:37.441 --> 00:21:53.108]  And I was just during the break, back in the coffee room, in the kitchen, and there was Fox News saying, well, as soon as all the fires are out, they're going to have arson experts get in and the fire department to find out what happened.
[00:21:54.189 --> 00:21:56.670]  But we know it's not arson.
[00:21:57.748 --> 00:21:59.049]  And we know it's not terrorism.
[00:21:59.389 --> 00:22:09.315]  So he says, there's no investigations been done, the government, the fire department say they don't know what did it, but it's not Muslims and it's not arsonists.
[00:22:11.436 --> 00:22:17.080]  Even though the reporter goes on to say, though there was no one in there at the time that the fire started, no renovation going on.
[00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:20.202]  That is, the renovators weren't in there at the time.
[00:22:21.803 --> 00:22:23.764]  Now you're going to hear and see this for yourself.
[00:22:26.323 --> 00:22:27.824]  So this is an attack on logic.
[00:22:28.925 --> 00:22:30.446]  They've not looked at the evidence.
[00:22:31.027 --> 00:22:36.972]  The fire was only going for an hour and they said no Islamic terror because Islamic terror doesn't exist.
[00:22:36.992 --> 00:22:46.079]  Remember Obama said that ISIS is the opposite of Islam and that Islam is peace and that Islam has never done anything wrong.
[00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:51.323]  But all you hear all day is about how bad Christianity is from our corporate media.
[00:22:52.748 --> 00:22:58.077]  And now Fox News is taking a giant, sickening turn to the globalist left.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.262]  It just never ends.
[00:23:01.282 --> 00:23:02.664]  So here's part of that Fox News report.
[00:23:03.105 --> 00:23:03.546]  It's shocking.
[00:23:04.838 --> 00:23:15.080]  That structure will be examined to make sure it's safe, and then firefighters will go in, they'll try to retrieve anything they can from this and also really assess what happened.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.261]  There's going to be a team of 50 inspectors going in.
[00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:26.683]  The source of the fire, it is thought that it was the renovation work around the spire in the rear part of the nave.
[00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:33.424]  Somehow it set off this fire, but we've just learned that in fact all the renovation workers had left
[00:23:33.724 --> 00:23:35.285]  Well, before the fire started.
[00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:39.748]  So that raises questions, but no arson, absolutely no terrorism.
[00:23:40.349 --> 00:23:43.651]  That's being ruled out, and all of that is a good thing.
[00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:46.053]  Right now, outpouring of grief.
[00:23:46.153 --> 00:23:48.134]  I'm here right along the... Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:23:48.154 --> 00:23:54.058]  Now that just happened minutes ago, live from Paris.
[00:23:54.078 --> 00:24:00.182]  If you're already a listener, with what's left of Notre Dame, one of the most important religious sites for Christians in the world.
[00:24:00.642 --> 00:24:02.604]  Beautiful piece of architecture and history regardless.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.582]  And people risking their lives to get in and get the artifacts out that are priceless.
[00:24:10.743 --> 00:24:12.904]  And he says, they have to go in and assess.
[00:24:12.924 --> 00:24:13.984]  They don't know what happened.
[00:24:15.645 --> 00:24:18.487]  No one's even gone in yet to assess things.
[00:24:20.588 --> 00:24:22.688]  But as soon as it's safe, they'll go in to find out what happened.
[00:24:23.049 --> 00:24:25.650]  But we know it wasn't arson and we know it wasn't Islam.
[00:24:27.884 --> 00:24:34.950]  It's like they find a dead body with bullet holes in the back of your yard, and the police go, well, we know it wasn't foul play, but we don't know what happened.
[00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:38.412]  So we don't know what happened, but we know it wasn't foul play.
[00:24:38.973 --> 00:24:39.293]  Excuse me?
[00:24:40.374 --> 00:24:51.463]  So now, while a building's on fire, you're told not to ask questions, and all over MSNBC, CNN, they're attacking InfoWars on MSNBC and CNN.
[00:24:51.703 --> 00:24:52.924]  Surprise, surprise!
[00:24:53.384 --> 00:24:54.926]  They're attacking Paul Watson and saying,
[00:24:55.942 --> 00:24:58.305]  No one celebrated this on Twitter.
[00:24:58.485 --> 00:24:59.506]  No one celebrated it.
[00:24:59.786 --> 00:25:01.288]  No Islamic group celebrated it.
[00:25:01.568 --> 00:25:04.372]  And I have all their celebrations that are even in other newspapers.
[00:25:05.913 --> 00:25:07.175]  That's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:07.355 --> 00:25:10.438]  These people are just incredibly humorous filled.
[00:25:10.979 --> 00:25:12.481]  So let's go to Shep Smith.
[00:25:14.199 --> 00:25:23.385]  Old Shep Smith on Fox News yesterday and he's sitting there interviewing folks.
[00:25:24.466 --> 00:25:35.133]  And of course they both, Cabuto and he, interviewed leaders of the Catholic community, head of the Catholic League, government officials in France.
[00:25:35.693 --> 00:25:39.976]  And when they tried to ask a question, when they tried to say anything,
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:41.900]  They were shut down.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.301]  Here it is.
[00:25:42.721 --> 00:25:44.322]  Jamie White, Infowars.com.
[00:25:45.502 --> 00:25:51.285]  Shep Smith cuts off French official for alluding to Islamic arson of Notre Dame Cathedral.
[00:25:51.405 --> 00:25:53.206]  No, sir, we're not doing that here.
[00:25:53.966 --> 00:25:54.587]  Not now.
[00:25:54.867 --> 00:25:56.848]  Not on my watch, snaps Smith.
[00:25:57.268 --> 00:25:58.869]  Not on his watch!
[00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:01.630]  He gets someone on that's a French official.
[00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:04.311]  The cathedral's been targeted.
[00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:07.193]  It's been attacked before by Islamists.
[00:26:07.213 --> 00:26:08.954]  The Islamists say they're targeting it.
[00:26:09.707 --> 00:26:17.670]  They don't know the cause, but the official story from Macron, who's opened the doors to Islamify France, is it's not that.
[00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:21.112]  So the official story is you're being told you're not going to look at what it is.
[00:26:22.172 --> 00:26:22.492]  That's right.
[00:26:22.532 --> 00:26:30.575]  At this point, when you're told don't look at something before the fires are even out, and you've got Islamic groups saying we're going to target this and they have before, you've got to then default.
[00:26:30.595 --> 00:26:31.216]  There's a cover-up.
[00:26:32.236 --> 00:26:33.837]  But they don't want you to be able to ask questions.
[00:26:34.197 --> 00:26:35.277]  That's the cardinal sin.
[00:26:36.058 --> 00:26:37.098]  Here is the clip.
[00:26:39.207 --> 00:26:44.231]  Philippe Carcente is on the line with us, a French elected official who is in Paris now.
[00:26:45.531 --> 00:26:49.294]  Philippe, what have you seen and what do you know?
[00:26:51.055 --> 00:26:59.341]  Well, I was close to seeing what happened and now I left the place because we want to let people work around it.
[00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:02.723]  Everybody is really under shock now in France.
[00:27:03.444 --> 00:27:04.444]  I would tell you something.
[00:27:06.053 --> 00:27:08.775]  Even if nobody died.
[00:27:08.795 --> 00:27:09.656]  I mean, it's like a 9-11.
[00:27:09.816 --> 00:27:11.918]  It's a French 9-11, you know?
[00:27:12.758 --> 00:27:15.080]  And it's a big shock.
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:19.724]  I mean, this church was there for more than 850 years.
[00:27:19.744 --> 00:27:23.707]  Even the Nazis didn't dare to destroy it.
[00:27:25.288 --> 00:27:31.994]  And you need to know that for the past years, we had churches desecrated each and every week in France.
[00:27:32.754 --> 00:27:33.355]  All over France.
[00:27:34.182 --> 00:27:43.528]  So, of course you will hear the story about the political correctness which will tell you that it's probably an accident.
[00:27:43.668 --> 00:27:44.829]  Sir, sir, sir.
[00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:49.572]  We're not going to speculate here of the cause of something which we don't know.
[00:27:50.412 --> 00:27:56.136]  If you have observations or you know something, we would love to hear it.
[00:27:57.481 --> 00:27:58.662]  No, I'm just telling you something.
[00:27:58.982 --> 00:28:00.923]  You need to be ready.
[00:28:01.323 --> 00:28:01.723]  No, sir.
[00:28:01.823 --> 00:28:02.784]  We're not doing that here.
[00:28:03.284 --> 00:28:03.725]  Not now.
[00:28:04.265 --> 00:28:05.085]  Not on my watch.
[00:28:05.546 --> 00:28:08.127]  Felipe Carcente, it's very good of you to be here.
[00:28:09.548 --> 00:28:14.331]  Now, they're all on the news with no proof saying it's not Islamic and it's not arson.
[00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:15.491]  So they're speculating.
[00:28:15.751 --> 00:28:16.292]  They're lying.
[00:28:17.012 --> 00:28:19.153]  They're being definitive with no proof.
[00:28:19.914 --> 00:28:22.195]  They're engaged in fraud, regardless of what happened.
[00:28:23.717 --> 00:28:26.901]  This man says, we've got 800 churches burned up in the last year.
[00:28:26.941 --> 00:28:27.922]  That's what it is in France.
[00:28:28.763 --> 00:28:29.123]  Attacked.
[00:28:29.904 --> 00:28:31.606]  You've got that church being a major target.
[00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:41.057]  And he's saying, we're looking at this, and he's a French government official in the federal government, and Shep Smith hangs up on him.
[00:28:41.923 --> 00:28:45.044]  I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain
[00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:13.971]  Where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[00:29:14.432 --> 00:29:16.954]  So please, bear with me a few minutes.
[00:29:18.415 --> 00:29:21.418]  Because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes.
[00:29:22.639 --> 00:29:24.181]  Of why am I sitting here with my shirt off?
[00:29:25.041 --> 00:29:27.083]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[00:29:28.825 --> 00:29:35.211]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California like we're different football teams.
[00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:39.910]  And we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[00:29:41.171 --> 00:29:45.493]  This is not... Alex Jones is a tribalist going, woo!
[00:29:45.934 --> 00:29:47.715]  Texas is way better than California.
[00:29:47.935 --> 00:29:48.695]  F-California.
[00:29:50.136 --> 00:29:54.538]  California, until about 30 years ago, was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[00:29:55.739 --> 00:30:00.202]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[00:30:00.842 --> 00:30:02.383]  The 49ers, all of it.
[00:30:02.443 --> 00:30:05.625]  I mean, the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[00:30:07.023 --> 00:30:11.265]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[00:30:13.106 --> 00:30:22.891]  The Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is a skeleton of its former self.
[00:30:24.212 --> 00:30:30.775]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue, and most political experts agree by 20
[00:30:32.898 --> 00:30:35.640]  24.
[00:30:33.258 --> 00:30:35.640]  Texas will be deep blue.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.181]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[00:30:38.641 --> 00:30:45.824]  But as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:48.846]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[00:30:50.286 --> 00:30:51.187]  That's a whole other history book.
[00:30:52.207 --> 00:31:00.431]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, it's not a positive thing.
[00:31:02.108 --> 00:31:13.622]  It's not something I celebrate, it's like whistling past the graveyard, but... The carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California, because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians.
[00:31:14.343 --> 00:31:16.245]  They ruined that incredible state.
[00:31:17.026 --> 00:31:19.049]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:29.287]  And now like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-Boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[00:31:29.747 --> 00:31:47.182]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California by USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:56.962]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:58.202 --> 00:32:02.763]  The globalists want info wars shut down because they can track back.
[00:32:02.843 --> 00:32:04.783]  Almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[00:32:05.463 --> 00:32:08.184]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do.
[00:32:08.204 --> 00:32:09.564]  That's why we resonate together.
[00:32:10.204 --> 00:32:13.205]  And I'm telling you, this don't California, my USA.
[00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:16.226]  This don't California, my Texas, is the answer.
[00:32:16.466 --> 00:32:17.686]  The people have to be warned.
[00:32:18.246 --> 00:32:25.429]  We've got 10 different limited edition shirts at mfolwarestore.com right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[00:32:26.089 --> 00:32:27.950]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:34.813]  And so, for the next week or so, while supplies last, 50% off.
[00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:37.314]  That means I'm making $5 on these shirts from the MFOLWAR.
[00:32:37.734 --> 00:32:43.996]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[00:32:44.216 --> 00:32:53.619]  Infowarsstore.com and look at the 10 limited edition Don't California my USA, Don't California Texas.
[00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:56.040]  Now welcome folks to say Don't California Florida.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.761]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[00:32:59.101 --> 00:33:00.481]  We can do it if we take action.
[00:33:00.662 --> 00:33:01.822]  We can save America!
[00:33:06.081 --> 00:33:12.247]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:30.005]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.412 --> 00:33:35.796]  Well, Neil, if it is an accident, it's a monumental tragedy.
[00:33:36.396 --> 00:33:38.198]  But forgive me for being suspicious.
[00:33:38.639 --> 00:33:42.663]  Just last month, a 17th century church was set on fire in Paris.
[00:33:43.244 --> 00:33:48.510]  We've seen tabernacles knocked down, crosses have been torn down, statues have been smashed.
[00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:49.130]  We don't know that.
[00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:49.591]  We don't know.
[00:33:49.631 --> 00:33:53.135]  So if we can avoid what your suspicions might be, I do want to look
[00:33:53.695 --> 00:34:02.137]  At what happens now, there was a very pricey rebuilding and renovation effort going on that involved a good deal of Catholic fundraising campaigns.
[00:34:02.197 --> 00:34:06.998]  I know in this country and abroad, this renovation was paid for up front.
[00:34:07.018 --> 00:34:08.699]  So in other words, all the monies were there.
[00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:17.181]  And now I'm wondering how much more the Catholic Church commits to this, or do you think now they first want to get to the bottom of it?
[00:34:18.151 --> 00:34:21.753]  Well first they have to get to the bottom of it and they will rebuild it, there's no question about that.
[00:34:21.973 --> 00:34:24.754]  Certainly the Catholic Church will come up with the money for it, that's not even a question.
[00:34:25.294 --> 00:34:33.238]  But I'm sorry, I mean, when I find out that the Eucharist is being destroyed and excrement is being smeared on crosses, this is going on now!
[00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:38.759]  Bill, I love you dearly, but we cannot make conjectures about this, so thank you very much.
[00:34:38.819 --> 00:34:39.560]  Bill, I'm sorry.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:40.500]  Thank you very, very much.
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:47.562]  I do want to let people know, and again, we're not trying to be rude to our guests here, there is so much we do not know about what happened here.
[00:34:47.622 --> 00:34:51.263]  We do know that about four hours ago, something started here.
[00:34:51.323 --> 00:35:02.906]  Now, there are incidents that have been raised against the Catholic Church, a lot of popular tourist sites, certainly in and around Paris, no stranger to attacks, but it is another leap to start taking views like that.
[00:35:03.366 --> 00:35:07.289]  Really don't.
[00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:10.272]  By the way, in just a few minutes we'll get to the video.
[00:35:11.233 --> 00:35:12.814]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:13.675 --> 00:35:16.617]  ISIS supporters celebrate Notre Dame's inferno.
[00:35:17.197 --> 00:35:21.381]  Three years after terror groups failed bomb attack on the same cathedral.
[00:35:23.217 --> 00:35:36.105]  But that's okay, because Neil Caputo and Shep Smith say, it doesn't matter if you're the head of the Catholic League, it doesn't matter if you're a federal official in the government, that they invite on as a guest, and you say, listen, they're blowing up churches everywhere.
[00:35:36.145 --> 00:35:38.706]  They said they would attack in and around Easter.
[00:35:39.206 --> 00:35:40.347]  They do this all over the world.
[00:35:40.567 --> 00:35:40.867]  No!
[00:35:41.208 --> 00:35:42.408]  It's not Islamic!
[00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.051]  It's not Islamic.
[00:35:47.131 --> 00:35:48.532]  Do not look there.
[00:35:49.192 --> 00:35:49.493]  Okay?
[00:35:49.873 --> 00:35:50.893]  We have it investigated.
[00:35:50.973 --> 00:35:51.734]  We have it looked.
[00:35:54.073 --> 00:35:56.415]  But we're going to tell you it's not Islamic and it's not terror.
[00:35:56.435 --> 00:36:04.682]  Even though there was nobody working in the building at the time, we're just going to tell you that we know it's not Islam because it is the religion of peace.
[00:36:04.962 --> 00:36:05.462]  Period.
[00:36:07.364 --> 00:36:12.968]  Meanwhile, we've had giant caravans, hundreds of thousands, every few weeks slamming into the United States.
[00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:20.915]  We have Democratic Party paid-for buses just picking up men, women, and children who disappear to be given fake IDs and vote.
[00:36:22.955 --> 00:36:31.602]  A permanent underclass, a new giant group of caravans just smashed over the Mexican border with Guatemala, overrunning police, just like last year.
[00:36:31.943 --> 00:36:32.683]  That's all happened.
[00:36:36.967 --> 00:36:39.389]  And we've got new giant waves of Islamic invasion.
[00:36:39.569 --> 00:36:42.231]  Millions now pouring into Europe.
[00:36:42.371 --> 00:36:44.333]  A third giant wave.
[00:36:46.215 --> 00:36:47.476]  It's all happening.
[00:36:47.496 --> 00:36:51.159]  And you've got the former head of Homeland Security, the former head of ICE, both
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.502]  Coming out and saying this is the worst crisis ever.
[00:36:56.282 --> 00:36:58.043]  It's three times any number we've ever seen.
[00:36:58.063 --> 00:37:00.905]  And I see some leftist press blaming Trump.
[00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:03.887]  Oh, the reason there's record people coming here is because of you.
[00:37:04.068 --> 00:37:11.953]  No, the UN, George Soros, the State Department, shedded up with the refugee centers to prepare this and to break our border.
[00:37:14.034 --> 00:37:16.176]  Steve Watson has the article at InfoWars.com.
[00:37:16.876 --> 00:37:18.017]  Obama border patrol head.
[00:37:18.657 --> 00:37:20.679]  Crisis is worst in the history of the country.
[00:37:22.205 --> 00:37:28.427]  So, while the Democrats got the refugee centers built and the millions ready to bum rush us, they said, this isn't happening.
[00:37:28.467 --> 00:37:29.407]  There's no caravan.
[00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:30.568]  There's no crisis.
[00:37:30.608 --> 00:37:31.448]  There's no diseases.
[00:37:31.668 --> 00:37:32.488]  There's no crime.
[00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:42.951]  And now that the courts are overwhelmed, the military is overwhelmed, federal law enforcement, ICE, the Border Patrol, it's all overwhelmed.
[00:37:44.412 --> 00:37:47.933]  Now, oh, it is a big crisis, and it's Trump's doing.
[00:37:48.911 --> 00:37:49.531]  It's Trump.
[00:37:50.012 --> 00:37:51.452]  Trump created the crisis.
[00:37:51.952 --> 00:37:53.473]  Trump put the children in cages.
[00:37:53.553 --> 00:37:54.653]  Trump, Trump, Trump.
[00:37:55.674 --> 00:37:57.035]  Good Lord.
[00:37:58.795 --> 00:37:59.676]  Oh, and here's the headlines.
[00:38:00.576 --> 00:38:11.781]  Libyan Prime Minister warns EU about almost a million of potential migrants, that's Islamic military-age men invaders, echoing Qaddafi and says a million are on their way.
[00:38:12.964 --> 00:38:13.924]  They are aggressive.
[00:38:13.964 --> 00:38:18.886]  He says, we are facing a war of aggression that will spread its cancer throughout the Mediterranean.
[00:38:19.306 --> 00:38:29.549]  This is the radical Islamists that took over Libya, have been partially repulsed, and now it's left the government saying, emergency, emergency, they're killing us, they're coming for you.
[00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:32.490]  Islamic radicals have entered the base.
[00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.930]  Islamic radicals have entered the base.
[00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:44.633]  I mean, we've got videos where you can look out a high-rise window and see, like, 400 fires burning.
[00:38:46.855 --> 00:38:48.917]  And people going, Molag, Molag!
[00:38:48.937 --> 00:38:51.379]  Just running around, just Molag cocktailing.
[00:38:51.419 --> 00:38:54.162]  Each person has two or three Molag cocktails in a backpack.
[00:38:54.362 --> 00:38:55.783]  Each person burns three cars.
[00:38:56.423 --> 00:39:02.789]  You'll have 500 dudes running around, and they'll just go down street after street, and the domesticated Europeans literally piss themselves.
[00:39:04.377 --> 00:39:05.478]  And I'm not putting Europeans down.
[00:39:05.558 --> 00:39:06.778]  It's just they're so domesticated.
[00:39:07.739 --> 00:39:10.100]  And you hear the video, some in English, like, what do we do?
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:16.823]  Allah Akbar!
[00:39:17.123 --> 00:39:20.164]  They know to burn Europe, and they're burning the churches.
[00:39:20.244 --> 00:39:26.787]  And then you get French officials and Catholic officials going, well, and a major cardinal in the U.S.
[00:39:27.028 --> 00:39:28.228]  saying it's Islamic invasion.
[00:39:28.648 --> 00:39:29.749]  Guard yourself for true.
[00:39:32.813 --> 00:39:33.834]  We're told stand down.
[00:39:34.775 --> 00:39:35.355]  Stand down.
[00:39:36.056 --> 00:39:36.837]  Everything's fine.
[00:39:37.617 --> 00:39:38.578]  Everything's okay.
[00:39:39.339 --> 00:39:39.879]  Go to sleep.
[00:39:41.261 --> 00:39:45.665]  Meanwhile, Caitlin Bennett will be joining us.
[00:39:46.345 --> 00:39:51.390]  She is a reporter with a long history of being very polite.
[00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:53.452]  She went to a Bernie Sanders event.
[00:39:54.653 --> 00:39:55.333]  They threw her out.
[00:39:56.494 --> 00:39:58.256]  It has 12 million views on Twitter.
[00:39:59.764 --> 00:40:02.745]  They mocked her and threw her out.
[00:40:03.345 --> 00:40:04.826]  She will be joining us.
[00:40:05.906 --> 00:40:08.207]  And what did Bernie Sanders tell the local news?
[00:40:09.908 --> 00:40:11.809]  When it became a big story in Ohio?
[00:40:13.049 --> 00:40:19.451]  That her and Millie Weaver, both from that area by the way, were thrown out?
[00:40:20.812 --> 00:40:25.054]  He said, Infowars is a white supremacist platform.
[00:40:25.974 --> 00:40:28.355]  And Caitlin Bennett is a white supremacist.
[00:40:29.755 --> 00:40:30.735]  That's the way it is.
[00:40:31.836 --> 00:40:32.976]  That's actually a quote.
[00:40:33.536 --> 00:40:36.297]  We'll play you News 21 in B.C.
[00:40:36.717 --> 00:40:37.757]  when we come back.
[00:40:38.437 --> 00:40:40.338]  Young lady, you want to come?
[00:40:40.678 --> 00:40:41.778]  You want to videotape?
[00:40:43.378 --> 00:40:47.679]  We're going to have you thrown out and then we're going to call you a Nazi.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:54.141]  And then I'm going to go on Fox News and call for free health care and have them cheer me.
[00:40:55.021 --> 00:40:57.522]  You know Fox rigged who they had in the focus group.
[00:40:58.815 --> 00:40:59.075]  Show?
[00:40:59.315 --> 00:40:59.696]  Ha ha!
[00:41:00.456 --> 00:41:02.278]  That is the way it is!
[00:41:03.118 --> 00:41:04.419]  Do you understand?
[00:41:04.439 --> 00:41:07.382]  I will bankrupt America like I did at college.
[00:41:07.482 --> 00:41:08.302]  I will steal the money.
[00:41:09.183 --> 00:41:11.144]  Alex Jones had a major typo yesterday.
[00:41:12.485 --> 00:41:13.426]  I said he drives a $115,000 Audi.
[00:41:13.446 --> 00:41:13.746]  Excuse me!
[00:41:13.766 --> 00:41:14.307]  The car cost $180,000.
[00:41:14.387 --> 00:41:15.408]  He owns three $1 million homes.
[00:41:28.516 --> 00:41:35.422]  I don't know about you, but I've never owned a car that cost more than $70,000, which is fine if you do!
[00:41:36.443 --> 00:41:49.214]  But the point is, you don't get to be a commie with big butt teeth and a psycho look and tell us how America sucks all day when you drive around in the classic old man $180,000
[00:41:53.214 --> 00:41:55.735]  Audi sports car that goes 220 miles an hour.
[00:41:55.855 --> 00:41:59.376]  Can we pull up Bernie Sanders and his fancy sports car?
[00:41:59.836 --> 00:42:00.617]  Just type it in.
[00:42:00.997 --> 00:42:01.697]  It's everywhere.
[00:42:01.737 --> 00:42:02.917]  It confirms it's him.
[00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:03.838]  That's right.
[00:42:03.878 --> 00:42:04.338]  Pull back.
[00:42:05.218 --> 00:42:09.100]  He's driving around in a bright red $175,000 car that with taxes, we looked it up, cost $183,000 on average.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:09.400]  A $183,000 car!
[00:42:23.049 --> 00:42:36.372]  With swindled money out of the campaign, but because he is an anointed one with the Democratic Party and a socialist just like Hillary and just like everybody else, he is allowed to do it.
[00:42:38.186 --> 00:42:40.667]  Well, InfoWars isn't funded by the Globalist.
[00:42:40.687 --> 00:42:41.487]  We're funded by you.
[00:42:41.887 --> 00:42:44.588]  And right now, we've got the once-a-year annual sale.
[00:42:44.948 --> 00:42:51.450]  All ball caps, all t-shirts, all everything that is apparel, 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:59.552]  And $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze, the ultimate four-stage ion filter at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:02.475 --> 00:43:06.439]  Iodine used to be used in bread as a dough enhancer.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:12.726]  Then in the early 1970s, most commercial manufacturers switched to bromide instead.
[00:43:13.146 --> 00:43:18.993]  Research from a World Health Organization study show that 10 to 50% of people worldwide are deficient in iodine.
[00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:21.976]  In fact, over 90% of Americans are low in iodine.
[00:43:22.236 --> 00:43:29.739]  Since 1970, the iodine they collected in urine is 50% less now than it was then.
[00:43:29.759 --> 00:43:37.961]  In 2004, a survey of 100 pregnant mothers found that 58% were between moderately and severely deficient in iodine.
[00:43:38.561 --> 00:43:42.823]  Maternal iodine deficiency is particularly dangerous to the developing fetus.
[00:43:43.698 --> 00:43:47.299]  Most people, I think everybody, for the most part, should be supplementing with iodine.
[00:43:47.499 --> 00:43:53.462]  Well, another element that you have to have, and if you don't have it, you'll die, that's a fact, is iodine.
[00:43:54.442 --> 00:44:03.305]  And the fields and the systems that we grow crops on have been almost totally debased of true atomic iodine.
[00:44:03.846 --> 00:44:08.027]  We have the most absolutely clean, deep-earth crystal source of iodine, X2.
[00:44:08.047 --> 00:44:09.808]  You're probably going, wait a minute,
[00:44:10.882 --> 00:44:12.707]  For the last year you've been saying X2's selling out.
[00:44:12.727 --> 00:44:14.031]  It was the last run.
[00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:14.994]  It's been sold out for two months.
[00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.950]  How is X2 back?
[00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:21.033]  It was very hard to get from the oil companies that get it drilling down to 12,000 feet.
[00:44:21.513 --> 00:44:24.575]  We got put over the barrel, some industrial sabotage, we couldn't get it anymore.
[00:44:25.176 --> 00:44:35.223]  But by really putting pressure on from the original manufacturer, we were able to get the deep-earth crystal iodine that's absolutely pure, absolutely atomic, that nobody else has, and bring it to you.
[00:44:35.283 --> 00:44:39.226]  So X2 Original is back by the grace of God.
[00:44:39.646 --> 00:44:40.767]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[00:44:41.187 --> 00:44:45.532]  You need to do research into Iodine and the Iodine Conspiracy for yourself.
[00:44:45.992 --> 00:44:47.794]  In a few minutes, I can't break it all down.
[00:44:48.215 --> 00:44:49.516]  And a lot of you have listened to me.
[00:44:50.036 --> 00:44:52.299]  It has thousands and thousands of four-star reviews.
[00:44:52.779 --> 00:44:55.122]  I want like a 4.9 star on Power Reviews.
[00:44:55.722 --> 00:44:59.226]  But many of you hear me talk about this and it's just more background chatter.
[00:45:00.067 --> 00:45:02.550]  The most powerful thing in our lives.
[00:45:03.559 --> 00:45:06.120]  Is our own metabolic system, our own electrochemical system.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:18.644]  So from our brain waves, to our nerves, to our bodies, to our glands, the engine, the foundational tool between so much of it, our hormones, you name it, is pure iodine.
[00:45:19.184 --> 00:45:22.269]  And if you don't have iodine, your body will absorb the bad halogens.
[00:45:22.289 --> 00:45:23.411]  So, iodine is amazing.
[00:45:23.451 --> 00:45:24.032]  It's important.
[00:45:24.052 --> 00:45:26.275]  A lot of forms of it out there are all mixed up and jacked.
[00:45:26.335 --> 00:45:26.856]  They'll hurt you.
[00:45:27.237 --> 00:45:27.938]  This is pure.
[00:45:28.218 --> 00:45:28.899]  This is clean.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.041]  This is amazing.
[00:45:30.382 --> 00:45:32.164]  And it funds the info war, a 360 win.
[00:45:32.184 --> 00:45:32.265]  So, X2.
[00:45:34.648 --> 00:45:37.330]  Our overall best-selling product is now back.
[00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:42.415]  X2 Original from the very first original manufacturer.
[00:45:42.795 --> 00:45:49.340]  The exact same X2 at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.162]  As I said, get your pre-orders in.
[00:45:51.182 --> 00:45:52.323]  A week, week and a half.
[00:45:52.603 --> 00:45:53.764]  It's being labeled right now.
[00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:54.564]  It's already been bottled.
[00:45:54.865 --> 00:46:01.390]  And we are going to have it for you, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:02.371]  Thank you all for your support.
[00:46:07.233 --> 00:46:08.914]  DNA Force Plus.
[00:46:09.534 --> 00:46:11.375]  Our most advanced formula yet.
[00:46:14.677 --> 00:46:25.243]  DNA Force Plus is focused on overhauling your body's cellular engines and supporting your optimal energy levels while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[00:46:28.101 --> 00:46:36.608]  DNA Force Plus contains a combination of the best adaptogens on the market to help your body adapt and bend, not break.
[00:46:37.188 --> 00:46:41.571]  Hand-picked adaptogen herbs help protect your body on a cellular level.
[00:46:42.212 --> 00:46:48.397]  It's time to try the newest version of one of our most powerful formulas yet with DNA Force Plus.
[00:46:54.756 --> 00:46:57.819]  Available at infowarslife.com today.
[00:47:07.006 --> 00:47:09.589]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:40.595 --> 00:47:51.442]  Snopes says that Bernie Sanders wouldn't drive around in a $170,000 car, but it turns out he did.
[00:47:52.302 --> 00:47:58.526]  Snopes also says Islam has never committed one terror attack because that's not real Islam.
[00:47:59.007 --> 00:48:00.167]  Obama said so.
[00:48:01.028 --> 00:48:08.653]  And NPR and Snopes and CNN, they decide what is reality and what is not.
[00:48:10.871 --> 00:48:13.373]  Of course, everyone decides to tune out of them.
[00:48:14.693 --> 00:48:17.155]  And so the answer is to make you watch.
[00:48:17.235 --> 00:48:18.736]  But let me get really serious here.
[00:48:22.116 --> 00:48:25.657]  You have ISIS saying they're going to blow up and firebomb Notre Dame.
[00:48:25.757 --> 00:48:27.217]  You have them trying to do it repeatedly.
[00:48:27.737 --> 00:48:34.499]  You have this happening the week of Easter, where other churches are being blown up all over the world, and there's zero news coverage.
[00:48:34.619 --> 00:48:39.660]  And if government officials try to say on CNN or Fox, hey, this needs to be looked at.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.881]  We haven't investigated yet.
[00:48:41.961 --> 00:48:43.081]  We're not going to speculate.
[00:48:43.241 --> 00:48:44.481]  There's no way it's Islam.
[00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:45.422]  No way it's arson.
[00:48:47.882 --> 00:48:48.462]  Move along.
[00:48:48.502 --> 00:48:49.243]  Nothing to see here.
[00:48:49.263 --> 00:48:50.963]  These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:58.405]  Meanwhile, our borders are literally being opened completely up right now.
[00:49:00.126 --> 00:49:03.309]  Oh, there are no caravans.
[00:49:03.329 --> 00:49:04.971]  There are no emergencies at the border.
[00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:05.971]  Remember that the last few years?
[00:49:07.052 --> 00:49:08.714]  And then now, oh, it's a big emergency.
[00:49:08.754 --> 00:49:09.454]  It's Trump's fault.
[00:49:11.556 --> 00:49:18.182]  Sanctuary cities deserve Trump migrant dumping plan, former ICE chief says, who worked for Obama.
[00:49:19.642 --> 00:49:23.906]  Yeah, we don't have the jails to hold them, and we've got due process, and the courts can't ship them.
[00:49:24.106 --> 00:49:25.287]  You know, Mexico doesn't even have that.
[00:49:25.327 --> 00:49:26.528]  You're illegal, you're shipped back.
[00:49:27.889 --> 00:49:29.550]  Oh, but the average wait's over four years now.
[00:49:29.791 --> 00:49:31.152]  So they're just catching release now.
[00:49:31.192 --> 00:49:31.732]  That's the law.
[00:49:31.973 --> 00:49:32.833]  Trump's tried to change it.
[00:49:37.377 --> 00:49:40.039]  And so, we're not supposed to even ask questions about all that.
[00:49:41.961 --> 00:49:43.702]  But now Bernie Sanders has come out.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:49.302]  After the Caitlin Bennett video on Twitter alone has gotten 12 plus million views.
[00:49:50.003 --> 00:49:52.304]  Millions of views on YouTube.
[00:49:52.404 --> 00:49:54.305]  Millions of views on a bunch of other platforms.
[00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:56.145]  I think it's up to 20 million views right now.
[00:49:56.526 --> 00:50:00.047]  There's just one version, 12.7 million views.
[00:50:04.009 --> 00:50:06.650]  So, now we have Bernie Sanders.
[00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:07.631]  How's he going to respond?
[00:50:08.752 --> 00:50:13.000]  To these bullies kicking a female reporter out and saying, you're not real news, you're info wars.
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:18.530]  Well, you advertised it was a public event at a school auditorium at a public school.
[00:50:19.977 --> 00:50:21.398]  And so she shows up, she's peaceful.
[00:50:21.858 --> 00:50:22.859]  She's driven out of there.
[00:50:23.439 --> 00:50:25.600]  And so, because it makes you look bad, what do you do?
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:30.083]  Well, Bernie Sanders just calls her a white supremacist.
[00:50:30.143 --> 00:50:30.523]  That's right.
[00:50:31.023 --> 00:50:31.904]  Bernie Sanders.
[00:50:32.344 --> 00:50:35.085]  InfoWars, a white supremacist platform.
[00:50:35.786 --> 00:50:39.088]  Campaign kicked out, Kaitlan Bennett, from Ohio Rally.
[00:50:40.049 --> 00:50:40.429]  Because?
[00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:43.232]  We don't support free speech in Venezuela.
[00:50:43.552 --> 00:50:44.873]  I mean, Russia.
[00:50:44.953 --> 00:50:47.115]  Excuse me, I meant North Korea.
[00:50:47.455 --> 00:50:50.277]  Oh, the future U.S.S.A.
[00:50:52.078 --> 00:50:54.520]  So, let's go to that local NBC News clip.
[00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:55.061]  Here it is.
[00:50:56.095 --> 00:50:58.736]  You may remember her as the Kent State gun girl.
[00:50:58.796 --> 00:51:02.337]  She posed with an AR-10 rifle at her Kent State graduation last year.
[00:51:02.417 --> 00:51:07.840]  But yesterday, Caitlin Bennett says she was kicked out of the Bernie Sanders campaign event without explanation.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:11.201]  She spoke with Matt Stone today about why she thinks it happened.
[00:51:12.719 --> 00:51:24.724]  Since Kent grad Caitlin Bennett took those gun pics on campus last year, she's been busy speaking out for conservative causes and recently being hired by the infowars.com website as a reporter.
[00:51:25.324 --> 00:51:31.447]  That's why she showed up at the Bernie Sanders campaign stop in Lordstown, a rally that was supposed to be public.
[00:51:31.994 --> 00:51:33.736]  I asked them, did I violate any rules?
[00:51:33.776 --> 00:51:34.597]  Did I do anything?
[00:51:34.637 --> 00:51:35.538]  Am I a disturbance?
[00:51:36.098 --> 00:51:37.419]  No, I was scrolling on Facebook.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.302]  They simply didn't want me there because they know who I am.
[00:51:40.703 --> 00:51:43.425]  And I believe that event was staged.
[00:51:43.506 --> 00:51:48.190]  They had plants in the audience that were supposed to ask the questions.
[00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:53.596]  Bernie was scripted with the responses and they didn't want anybody else to try to ask him questions.
[00:51:54.096 --> 00:51:59.080]  Bennett says she would have asked Sanders if he supports free health care for illegal immigrants.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:02.322]  So I'm being ejected from a public event?
[00:52:02.462 --> 00:52:08.126]  Instead, she says she was told to leave the public event, which she did, with no explanation as to why.
[00:52:08.727 --> 00:52:12.209]  She says she's never been a disturbance at any event she's covered before.
[00:52:12.810 --> 00:52:19.155]  We called the Sanders campaign to ask specifically why they had removed her, and they wouldn't answer the question directly.
[00:52:19.975 --> 00:52:21.917]  Instead, they gave us the following statement.
[00:52:22.557 --> 00:52:23.498]  None of that is true.
[00:52:23.518 --> 00:52:23.758]  All made up.
[00:52:23.778 --> 00:52:25.159]  Never targeted the parents of Sandy Hook.
[00:52:25.179 --> 00:52:25.800]  Not a white supremacist.
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.500]  They know that.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.403]  But Bernie Sanders is a dirty, filthy authoritarian.
[00:52:52.682 --> 00:52:58.385]  Who works with the dirty, filthy mainstream media and the dirty, filthy Democratic Party murdering the truth.
[00:52:59.285 --> 00:53:00.826]  They all know who Caitlin Bennett is.
[00:53:01.566 --> 00:53:05.228]  They had some of their little body snatchers come over behaving like Nazis.
[00:53:05.848 --> 00:53:06.808]  If anybody's a Nazi.
[00:53:07.269 --> 00:53:09.049]  And telling her, get out of there.
[00:53:09.450 --> 00:53:10.310]  And then she left.
[00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:15.992]  And then Americans recognized it as tyrannical and so you pull out the Nazi card.
[00:53:17.553 --> 00:53:19.134]  Just like you do
[00:53:20.948 --> 00:53:24.831]  on Laura Loomer and so many others who clearly aren't Nazis.
[00:53:25.572 --> 00:53:30.415]  Meanwhile, Sanders gets massive George Soros funding, an actual Nazi collaborator.
[00:53:31.016 --> 00:53:36.059]  Now, coming up, Caitlin Bennett will be joining us in about 15 minutes.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:46.928]  Leo Zagami, Vatican expert, will be joining us on the situation with, obviously, the Inferno in Notre Dame.
[00:53:47.947 --> 00:53:48.970]  That former sanctuary.
[00:53:49.632 --> 00:53:51.437]  Nick Magich will be in the studio with us.
[00:53:51.457 --> 00:53:53.363]  Dr. Nick Magich, can't wait for that.
[00:53:53.383 --> 00:53:55.308]  And then Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:53:56.846 --> 00:54:01.568]  From London, England, we'll be hosting our number four.
[00:54:01.768 --> 00:54:05.389]  And then, Owen Schroyer and the War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:54:05.409 --> 00:54:06.390]  Central Time.
[00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.010]  A lot of our stations are picking up.
[00:54:08.131 --> 00:54:09.791]  David Knight Show, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:54:09.811 --> 00:54:10.431]  to 11 a.m.
[00:54:10.772 --> 00:54:11.572]  We're picking up the War Room.
[00:54:11.592 --> 00:54:12.852]  We're very thankful to those stations.
[00:54:12.872 --> 00:54:24.017]  I want to encourage listeners to become sponsors of the local stations, or support the sponsors, or like you tithe to the local churches, but most of them aren't fighting for pro-life, most of them aren't
[00:54:25.171 --> 00:54:26.992]  Fighting for family values or sovereignty.
[00:54:27.913 --> 00:54:32.195]  I don't claim to be some Pharisee up here on a high horse that's perfect, but I love God and I love Christ.
[00:54:33.156 --> 00:54:35.177]  And we're not tax-exempt because the government can't regulate us.
[00:54:35.737 --> 00:54:44.703]  But when you buy a book, you buy a video, you buy a t-shirt, you buy coffee every month, you buy toothpaste every month, you buy stuff like the protein bars every month.
[00:54:46.224 --> 00:54:48.845]  On AutoShip, you can do it every two months, every three months, every four months.
[00:54:48.865 --> 00:54:49.686]  Just click the button.
[00:54:50.186 --> 00:54:51.287]  Cancel for free anytime.
[00:54:51.787 --> 00:54:52.688]  You can tithe
[00:54:53.919 --> 00:55:00.626]  A little bit of profit we make on each one to fund this operation, push us into the black and help us stand in the face of the globalists.
[00:55:00.646 --> 00:55:03.990]  So please, a lot of the great listeners have done this and we salute them, we thank them.
[00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:11.558]  But if you haven't habituated to go to infowarestore.com and get a t-shirt.
[00:55:12.038 --> 00:55:13.500]  We have the annual 50% off all apparel.
[00:55:16.311 --> 00:55:18.094]  Over a hundred amazing t-shirt designs.
[00:55:18.454 --> 00:55:19.195]  Spread the word.
[00:55:19.316 --> 00:55:20.197]  Meet like-minded people.
[00:55:20.377 --> 00:55:21.118]  A lot of new shirts.
[00:55:21.138 --> 00:55:22.601]  Don't California my USA.
[00:55:23.342 --> 00:55:24.604]  Ten different variants of that.
[00:55:25.445 --> 00:55:26.767]  Don't California my Texas.
[00:55:27.588 --> 00:55:29.351]  Baseball jersey style ones.
[00:55:29.972 --> 00:55:30.533]  Ball caps.
[00:55:30.553 --> 00:55:30.934]  You name it.
[00:55:32.335 --> 00:55:33.375]  Big discounts on that.
[00:55:33.555 --> 00:55:36.856]  Big discounts on Alexa Pure Breeze four-stage ion filters.
[00:55:36.876 --> 00:55:37.876]  Leading competitors are $500, $600.
[00:55:39.276 --> 00:55:40.517]  These are great deals at $300.
[00:55:41.097 --> 00:55:43.757]  It's $200 right now.
[00:55:43.777 --> 00:55:45.158]  $50 off.
[00:55:45.778 --> 00:55:46.878]  That helps fund our operation.
[00:55:46.918 --> 00:55:48.338]  And we have the best deal on food ever.
[00:55:48.918 --> 00:55:54.280]  It's in these high-quality plastic... I mean, hell, just the plastic container at Walmart would cost this much.
[00:55:54.300 --> 00:56:00.121]  You know, those nice, snap-top plastic, high-quality, rubber-made type material.
[00:56:01.081 --> 00:56:08.985]  And then it's got a two-week food supply in a big tote container.
[00:56:09.005 --> 00:56:12.187]  1,500 calories a day, 92 servings.
[00:56:13.048 --> 00:56:20.312]  You can see that's already got 97% positive reviews, 4.8 stars.
[00:56:21.052 --> 00:56:23.573]  That is the best deal on high-quality, storable food out there.
[00:56:24.054 --> 00:56:26.235]  And it's great to have one in your garage, one in your car.
[00:56:26.855 --> 00:56:31.621]  One at work in case something goes down or you can give it to people for charity or give it to homeless down the road.
[00:56:31.641 --> 00:56:32.542]  It lasts only five years.
[00:56:32.982 --> 00:56:33.983]  This is the best deal ever.
[00:56:34.444 --> 00:56:36.886]  You have a two-week supply.
[00:56:36.907 --> 00:56:37.968]  I'm going to put that back on screen.
[00:56:38.448 --> 00:56:44.555]  A two-week supply, ladies and gentlemen, that is more.
[00:56:45.456 --> 00:56:45.816]  That's right.
[00:56:45.836 --> 00:56:46.336]  That's right.
[00:56:46.356 --> 00:56:46.876]  That's right.
[00:57:12.525 --> 00:57:15.426]  $67 two-week food supply and just the container itself.
[00:57:16.607 --> 00:57:18.207]  It will cost close to that at Walmart.
[00:57:20.008 --> 00:57:21.429]  It's also highly reusable.
[00:57:21.549 --> 00:57:26.031]  Each food meal is in its own sealed vacuum sealed packet.
[00:57:27.119 --> 00:57:27.539]  Amazing.
[00:57:27.639 --> 00:57:32.163]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:32.443 --> 00:57:36.566]  But whatever you do, don't let the bullies shut you up and your free speech.
[00:57:37.106 --> 00:57:38.347]  Don't let them silence you.
[00:57:38.507 --> 00:57:38.987]  It's simple.
[00:57:39.468 --> 00:57:44.351]  Wear an Infowars t-shirt, or a Molon Labe shirt, or a meme like a Wolverine shirt.
[00:57:44.691 --> 00:57:45.992]  They're all there, hundreds of them.
[00:57:46.472 --> 00:57:48.174]  They'll do this once a year, 50% off.
[00:57:48.234 --> 00:57:49.274]  Get your t-shirts now.
[00:57:49.535 --> 00:57:50.615]  Wear your colors proud.
[00:57:52.557 --> 00:57:55.559]  Now to a dire warning about climate change.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:57.941]  A dire warning.
[00:57:57.961 --> 00:57:58.662]  A dire warning.
[00:57:58.682 --> 00:57:59.482]  A dire warning.
[00:57:59.502 --> 00:58:00.383]  A dire new warning.
[00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:01.184]  A dire warning.
[00:58:01.264 --> 00:58:02.265]  Another dire warning.
[00:58:02.285 --> 00:58:03.646]  The situation is dire.
[00:58:04.127 --> 00:58:05.008]  A dire warning.
[00:58:05.028 --> 00:58:06.249]  Dire consequences.
[00:58:06.289 --> 00:58:07.350]  A dire warning.
[00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:08.291]  It sounds dire.
[00:58:08.351 --> 00:58:09.712]  What prompted this warning?
[00:58:09.772 --> 00:58:11.634]  We have a global emergency.
[00:58:13.146 --> 00:58:17.349]  It's here, it's man-made, and there are going to be dire results.
[00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:23.552]  The government issued its most dramatic report yet about climate change today, and it came with a dire warning.
[00:58:23.652 --> 00:58:24.673]  A stark warning.
[00:58:24.793 --> 00:58:26.754]  A warning to humanity.
[00:58:26.774 --> 00:58:30.597]  An existential threat to human civilization on this planet.
[00:58:30.737 --> 00:58:34.559]  Experts say that we have until 2030 to avoid catastrophe.
[00:58:34.699 --> 00:58:40.623]  And we, the scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[00:58:40.643 --> 00:58:42.744]  12 years in which to act.
[00:58:44.648 --> 00:58:47.832]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[00:58:47.892 --> 00:58:50.496]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[00:58:50.516 --> 00:58:53.660]  By the year 2030, that's just 12 years from now.
[00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.844]  The future is closer than we think and is not good.
[00:58:56.985 --> 00:58:59.328]  There will be irreversible damage to the planet.
[00:58:59.768 --> 00:59:04.711]  Time is running out to prevent global warming from reaching a catastrophic milestone.
[00:59:04.751 --> 00:59:05.851]  Sea levels rising.
[00:59:05.991 --> 00:59:06.672]  Extreme drought.
[00:59:06.712 --> 00:59:07.672]  Severe storms.
[00:59:07.752 --> 00:59:10.334]  Widespread fires and extreme flooding.
[00:59:10.434 --> 00:59:11.654]  Dangerous heat waves.
[00:59:11.774 --> 00:59:12.875]  Rising sea levels.
[00:59:12.955 --> 00:59:14.896]  Enforcing millions from their homes.
[00:59:15.096 --> 00:59:17.517]  Crop failure and mass population movement.
[00:59:17.537 --> 00:59:18.658]  As well as food shortages.
[00:59:18.718 --> 00:59:21.520]  Millions around the world face future disaster.
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:22.320]  Pretty serious.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.441]  People are dying.
[00:59:23.461 --> 00:59:27.123]  President Trump has frequently doubted its existence and has called it a hoax.
[00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:27.863]  I don't believe it.
[00:59:29.984 --> 00:59:31.665]  The world is gonna end in 12 years.
[00:59:32.885 --> 00:59:40.688]  From the creators of the Russian Collusion Conspiracy and the Jussie Smollett hate crime, this summer, be afraid.
[00:59:41.068 --> 00:59:43.089]  Be very afraid.
[00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:44.989]  Like, this is the war.
[00:59:45.009 --> 00:59:46.350]  This is our World War II.
[00:59:46.530 --> 00:59:48.331]  Countdown to Apocalypse 2030.
[00:59:48.731 --> 00:59:51.672]  We're all gonna die.
[00:59:56.602 --> 01:00:01.563]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:00:01.603 --> 01:00:20.507]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.517 --> 01:00:45.702]  All right, let's get serious.
[01:00:45.722 --> 01:00:50.866]  The authoritarian lying swindler.
[01:00:52.233 --> 01:01:07.789]  The pig creature, the man that believes he's born to rule you and your family, has come out in Ohio and said that Caitlyn Bennett and Infowars are white supremacists after he had her, as a reporter, thrown out of his rally for absolutely no reason.
[01:01:07.989 --> 01:01:10.172]  What a dangerous dirtbag.
[01:01:11.195 --> 01:01:22.524]  And by calling her a white supremacist with these CBS TV shows where they say go out and assault Nazis, he's calling for Caitlyn Bennett to be shot or stabbed or murdered.
[01:01:23.205 --> 01:01:25.867]  The assaults on conservatives is already over the top.
[01:01:26.488 --> 01:01:30.031]  Bernie Sanders is a weatherman-loving terrorist.
[01:01:30.651 --> 01:01:36.256]  Bernie Sanders is a clear and present danger to this country and the world.
[01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:56.023]  And our putting up with this degenerate criminal's activities, swindling colleges, swindling, never having a paying job in his life until he was 40, it just shows how weak we are that this bug-eyed criminal, this charlatan, is taking over our society.
[01:01:56.063 --> 01:02:00.246]  And Fox News with Shep Smith and Neil Caputo and all these cowards.
[01:02:01.442 --> 01:02:09.065]  Who want to control conservatives, won't even let French officials or the head of the Catholic League point out that ISIS said they'd blow up Notre Dame last week.
[01:02:09.485 --> 01:02:10.985]  And they've attempted to blow it up before.
[01:02:11.425 --> 01:02:14.867]  And they've done no investigation, but they're told Islam isn't violent.
[01:02:15.227 --> 01:02:18.188]  And Bernie Sanders says, open our borders to Islam as well.
[01:02:19.248 --> 01:02:21.569]  So here is this anti-American filth.
[01:02:22.989 --> 01:02:26.831]  This enemy of everything that's good, Bernie Sanders, the tip of the globalist spear.
[01:02:27.899 --> 01:02:35.402]  On Fox being worshipped with a hand-picked group of stoolies and minions praying for free stuff from this criminal.
[01:02:35.662 --> 01:02:36.083]  Here it is.
[01:02:37.663 --> 01:02:40.885]  I want to ask the audience a question, if you could raise your hand here.
[01:02:41.225 --> 01:02:46.607]  A show of hands of how many people get their insurance from work, private insurance, right now.
[01:02:46.967 --> 01:02:48.608]  How many get it from private insurance?
[01:02:49.348 --> 01:02:55.271]  Okay, now of those, how many are willing to transition to what the Senator says, a government-run system?
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.801]  Woo!
[01:02:58.781 --> 01:02:59.722]  Woo!
[01:03:00.282 --> 01:03:03.405]  And right before that, you're going to get free health care.
[01:03:04.465 --> 01:03:05.586]  You're going to get free school.
[01:03:07.327 --> 01:03:09.088]  You're going to get free housing.
[01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:11.490]  You're going to get free health care.
[01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:14.072]  And there's going to be reparations.
[01:03:14.632 --> 01:03:21.297]  Every white baby born is a criminal that needs to pay money.
[01:03:22.197 --> 01:03:23.899]  One of my good friend's newborn babies
[01:03:24.738 --> 01:03:28.340]  From all the respiratory problems, he's on a respirator right now.
[01:03:29.341 --> 01:03:32.502]  That baby, according to me, Bernie Sanders, is guilty.
[01:03:33.323 --> 01:03:37.825]  Seriously, one of my friends has a really sick baby from all the stuff in the air, all the mold, all the deadly fungus.
[01:03:38.325 --> 01:03:41.227]  Pray for him, pray for Pat's baby, but little buck.
[01:03:41.947 --> 01:03:43.328]  But it's just so sick.
[01:03:43.588 --> 01:03:46.390]  I was thinking about how reparations is a new form of slavery.
[01:03:48.134 --> 01:03:51.675]  Something like 98% of people in this country have no ancestors even connected to slavery.
[01:03:51.975 --> 01:03:53.735]  But what if their daddy was a slave master?
[01:03:54.035 --> 01:03:54.756]  They had nothing to do with it.
[01:03:55.296 --> 01:03:57.896]  Since when are you guilty for what your grandpa did?
[01:03:58.157 --> 01:04:03.558]  Or your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandpa back eight generations did?
[01:04:03.578 --> 01:04:08.919]  That's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great.
[01:04:08.979 --> 01:04:09.659]  That's a lot of greats.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.340]  That's crazy!
[01:04:13.186 --> 01:04:15.648]  Hell, once you've already served your time, supposedly.
[01:04:15.668 --> 01:04:17.769]  I mean, if you had the slaves and served time for it.
[01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:19.571]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:04:20.291 --> 01:04:23.213]  Bernie Sanders knows.
[01:04:24.154 --> 01:04:25.495]  And he's gonna do it.
[01:04:25.855 --> 01:04:28.838]  Give me all your money, or you're racist.
[01:04:30.359 --> 01:04:36.183]  I'm going to swindle your country because I am better than you.
[01:04:37.304 --> 01:04:38.044]  Understand?
[01:04:40.402 --> 01:04:44.683]  My whole life I was gonna get you in a corner and kick your teeth in.
[01:04:45.504 --> 01:04:46.364]  I'm gonna do it.
[01:04:47.364 --> 01:04:54.886]  We're gonna gut this country and starve you Christians out and you're gonna work in slave camps just like in Russia for me!
[01:04:55.886 --> 01:04:56.887]  I am V.I.
[01:04:56.947 --> 01:04:58.127]  Levin reborn!
[01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:02.328]  I am Bernie Sanders and I will kill this country!
[01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:05.576]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:05:05.636 --> 01:05:05.996]  Go ahead.
[01:05:06.276 --> 01:05:08.477]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:05:08.497 --> 01:05:11.518]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:05:12.338 --> 01:05:13.479]  It just gets old, man.
[01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:15.500]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.281]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:05:18.521 --> 01:05:22.522]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:05:22.542 --> 01:05:25.023]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:05:25.844 --> 01:05:28.184]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:29.665]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:05:29.885 --> 01:05:30.765]  Us being shut down?
[01:05:31.005 --> 01:05:32.026]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:05:32.466 --> 01:05:33.507]  You know what, Alex?
[01:05:33.547 --> 01:05:34.628]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[01:05:34.648 --> 01:05:35.468]  Hey, Frank!
[01:05:35.729 --> 01:05:41.093]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:05:41.413 --> 01:05:45.696]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:05:45.936 --> 01:05:48.798]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:05:49.059 --> 01:05:49.439]  You understand?
[01:05:49.539 --> 01:05:50.800]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.341]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:05:53.302 --> 01:05:58.246]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:05:59.166 --> 01:05:59.867]  Do you understand?
[01:05:59.887 --> 01:06:01.068]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:06:11.072 --> 01:06:19.530]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:43.847 --> 01:07:02.663]  Well, if you just joined us on this live Tuesday, April 16, 2019 global transmission, CNN, MSNBC, NPR, all the usual state-run media, globalist-run media, collaborator media, is saying, don't question fire, don't question arson, don't question Islam,
[01:07:04.184 --> 01:07:10.609]  Even though ISIS and Al Qaeda said they were going to blow up Notre Dame and tried a few times, and were saying just last week they would and are now celebrating it.
[01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:15.453]  No, because Islamic terror doesn't exist.
[01:07:15.513 --> 01:07:17.434]  And French officials are being thrown off the air.
[01:07:18.295 --> 01:07:24.620]  The head of the Catholic League is being thrown off the air, even on Fox News, because they're saying, look, no one's investigated, but it's official.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:28.763]  You do not say it could be arson.
[01:07:30.044 --> 01:07:31.025]  That's just the way it is.
[01:07:32.816 --> 01:07:34.236]  Get used to it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:34.816 --> 01:07:37.877]  Absolutely amazing that we have gotten to this point.
[01:07:37.957 --> 01:07:42.298]  And I have a map here that we're posting up to Infowars.com.
[01:07:43.058 --> 01:07:48.960]  Notre Dame was the 875th church to have been vandalized in France this year alone.
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:50.480]  It was just vandalized last week.
[01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.821]  In the last four years, these are the attacks on French churches.
[01:07:54.321 --> 01:07:55.741]  Christians everywhere pray.
[01:07:55.881 --> 01:07:59.362]  Our faith is the number one persecuted religion in the world at this time.
[01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.103]  Let's not just believe
[01:08:03.737 --> 01:08:08.799]  Taya Jones, who did put up that official attack on church's map put up by the French government.
[01:08:09.919 --> 01:08:22.183]  I actually have CBN News and I have the UN saying attacks on Christians have doubled the last five years and account for almost 80% of the attacks on religious groups period worldwide.
[01:08:23.124 --> 01:08:26.445]  So, Christians are being annihilated.
[01:08:26.585 --> 01:08:27.725]  Christmas is under attack.
[01:08:27.765 --> 01:08:28.825]  The family's under attack.
[01:08:28.845 --> 01:08:33.187]  But don't worry, Fox News now makes jokes about there is no war on Christmas.
[01:08:34.716 --> 01:08:35.136]  Amazing.
[01:08:35.617 --> 01:08:38.319]  Churches desecrated in ongoing attacks across Europe.
[01:08:38.339 --> 01:08:38.900]  CBN.
[01:08:39.901 --> 01:08:41.102]  Over a thousand of them this year.
[01:08:41.602 --> 01:08:42.423]  Have a nice day.
[01:08:42.583 --> 01:08:47.027]  ISIS fanatics revel in Notre Dame's destruction, describing it as punishment.
[01:08:48.468 --> 01:08:50.250]  Just a few weeks ago, they said they would attack it.
[01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:52.632]  Of course, it happened around Easter.
[01:08:53.192 --> 01:08:57.216]  Alarm was raised 23 minutes before the Notre Dame blaze was detected.
[01:08:57.236 --> 01:08:59.498]  That's right.
[01:09:01.101 --> 01:09:04.967]  Cell of French women guided by ISIS behind failed Notre Dame attack.
[01:09:05.267 --> 01:09:05.808]  The Guardian.
[01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.230]  Oh.
[01:09:09.072 --> 01:09:10.374]  But that was a couple years ago.
[01:09:10.595 --> 01:09:14.120]  A cell of women posing as Catholics attacking.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.642]  Oh, but don't look at it!
[01:09:17.025 --> 01:09:18.987]  Was this same shell group involved now?
[01:09:19.487 --> 01:09:24.632]  We know the feminists come out with their bare breasts and go, I love the bar!
[01:09:24.932 --> 01:09:30.037]  They go get sexually mutilated and they just revel in men backhanding and breaking their noses.
[01:09:30.298 --> 01:09:32.319]  They go, you hate the West, break my nose, please.
[01:09:35.743 --> 01:09:37.785]  Because they're not feminists, they're West haters.
[01:09:38.085 --> 01:09:39.826]  They hate their daddy that was so nice to them.
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:56.725]  A shell of radicalized French women guided by Islamic State commanders in Syria was behind a failed terror attack near Paris Notre Dame Cathedral last weekend, and planned another violent attack this week before they were intercepted by police, the Paris prosecutors said.
[01:09:58.006 --> 01:10:01.087]  But now some of those same prosecutors are saying they think this is an Islamic attack.
[01:10:01.567 --> 01:10:04.688]  But don't worry, Shep Smith says, no you don't.
[01:10:05.728 --> 01:10:06.949]  Islam is peace.
[01:10:08.188 --> 01:10:09.728]  Well, Shep, I'm not against you that you're gay.
[01:10:09.748 --> 01:10:10.388]  That's fine with me.
[01:10:10.428 --> 01:10:13.849]  But if you went to one of these Islamic countries you're defending, they'd murder you, Shep!
[01:10:13.869 --> 01:10:14.569]  But you don't care!
[01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:15.289]  You love it!
[01:10:15.309 --> 01:10:16.650]  Because you hate America!
[01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:17.450]  That's your religion!
[01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:32.993]  The woman, aged 19, 23, and 39, were arrested a small town 19 miles south-east of Paris on Thursday night after they were linked to a discovery of a car parked with gas cylinders parked near the cathedral last weekend.
[01:10:33.982 --> 01:10:48.239]  Officials said the women had been planning an imminent attack against the busy Gare de Lyon station in Paris and were stopped after a police and intelligence operation described it as a race against time.
[01:10:50.612 --> 01:10:54.355]  Christians are the most persecuted religion in the world, reveals new report by the UN.
[01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:56.777]  Just thought I'd show you that since I mentioned it's out of the Express UK.
[01:10:57.437 --> 01:11:02.401]  An ISIS plot to blow up Notre Dame Cathedral and rule the world, the Daily Beast, two years ago.
[01:11:03.002 --> 01:11:04.303]  Let's see, now it's not a big deal.
[01:11:05.724 --> 01:11:07.165]  You see, do not ask questions.
[01:11:07.585 --> 01:11:08.626]  Do not ask questions.
[01:11:09.207 --> 01:11:10.248]  Do not ask questions.
[01:11:10.428 --> 01:11:14.231]  Oh, meanwhile, YouTube came out.
[01:11:16.097 --> 01:11:21.941]  And just like when Brennan, the former head of the CIA, went in front of the CFR a few years ago.
[01:11:24.342 --> 01:11:27.024]  Eddie Bravo was playing this on his show last week when I was in LA.
[01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:32.407]  I'd seen the text and the transcript on CFR.org, but I didn't know he'd actually done a press conference.
[01:11:32.427 --> 01:11:36.789]  And he's like, yeah, we're controlling the weather, but a lot of governments don't like it, so we keep most of it secret.
[01:11:37.109 --> 01:11:41.392]  We're spraying aluminum dioxide, barium salt in the sky, high-altitude aerosol injection.
[01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:47.505]  We're gonna totally control the weather now with the chemtrails.
[01:11:50.787 --> 01:11:56.291]  And they put an encyclopedia Britannica thing under it saying, it's only ice crystals, this doesn't exist.
[01:11:56.711 --> 01:12:01.875]  So when they admit it, because they can't hide it, they still put a little factoid saying it's not true.
[01:12:01.955 --> 01:12:04.777]  So, some people
[01:12:07.383 --> 01:12:09.643]  We're questioning this as a possible arson yesterday.
[01:12:10.184 --> 01:12:15.765]  So the little Southern Prairie Law Center folks that actually admittedly hired 10,000 of at YouTube didn't know what to do.
[01:12:15.825 --> 01:12:20.525]  They said, so let's just put a message up that 9-11 was an inside job.
[01:12:22.586 --> 01:12:24.446]  They go, what fits best is a factoid.
[01:12:25.766 --> 01:12:26.947]  Don't investigate as arson.
[01:12:26.987 --> 01:12:29.527]  Don't say Islam could do this, even though they said they're going to do it.
[01:12:29.547 --> 01:12:30.687]  OK, well, people question 9-11.
[01:12:31.027 --> 01:12:32.368]  So let's just put under this,
[01:12:34.275 --> 01:12:36.377]  It doesn't even fit, it's like a round peg in a square hole.
[01:12:37.078 --> 01:12:45.867]  Let's just say, you know it makes no sense, that don't say 9-11 is a conspiracy theory.
[01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:48.621]  And people are like, what does this have to do with this?
[01:12:48.722 --> 01:12:49.182]  Exactly.
[01:12:49.422 --> 01:12:57.144]  They've got such stupid SJWs in there that people are all over the place questioning because a big building's burning on TV for six hours.
[01:12:57.605 --> 01:12:58.425]  Is it arson?
[01:12:58.845 --> 01:13:00.025]  Is it an electrical fire?
[01:13:00.305 --> 01:13:01.326]  Was it construction?
[01:13:01.606 --> 01:13:03.146]  Is it an Islamic terror attack?
[01:13:03.246 --> 01:13:03.807]  We don't know.
[01:13:03.867 --> 01:13:05.307]  It's totally normal to speculate.
[01:13:06.368 --> 01:13:07.388]  The fires weren't even out.
[01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:18.395]  And then they're going, no, no, no, you don't question, we don't know what it is, but we know it's not arson, and we know it's not Islam, because Islam doesn't ever do anything violent.
[01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:25.118]  And as Bernie Sanders said, white people do not know what it's like to be poor.
[01:13:26.098 --> 01:13:31.861]  We played the newscast earlier, Bernie Sanders, who had a reporter thrown out of a public event.
[01:13:32.694 --> 01:13:35.617]  The announcements public says that she is a white supremacist.
[01:13:36.117 --> 01:13:40.161]  Yeah, I think it's time to have old Robert Barnes file a lawsuit on old Sanders.
[01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:43.083]  Old Sandy.
[01:13:45.085 --> 01:13:46.146]  Old Sandy.
[01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:48.128]  His right to rule.
[01:13:48.148 --> 01:13:52.912]  One reign to rule them all and in the darkness bind them.
[01:13:54.113 --> 01:13:54.713]  Born to rule.
[01:13:54.733 --> 01:13:58.537]  Can we put that butt-toothed demon chipmunk back on screen, please?
[01:14:00.666 --> 01:14:02.949]  We're TV viewers from a radio show that is simulcast.
[01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:04.831]  I am your boss.
[01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:07.554]  Hello, I'm here to babysit your children.
[01:14:08.355 --> 01:14:08.755]  My!
[01:14:10.117 --> 01:14:12.179]  Oh, let me take care of that for you.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:13.340]  Ha ha!
[01:14:14.321 --> 01:14:16.224]  I am Bernie Sanders!
[01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:18.199]  We're going to go to break.
[01:14:18.339 --> 01:14:19.360]  Caitlin Bennett's coming on.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.721]  Then we have a reporter from Europe, Leo Zagami, and so much more.
[01:14:22.761 --> 01:14:24.942]  And I intend to open the phones up and get your take on this.
[01:14:24.982 --> 01:14:31.764]  But don't you question or say it might be arson or might be Islamic, even though the local police say that, because you're not allowed to.
[01:14:32.204 --> 01:14:33.665]  BuzzFeed says we're not allowed to.
[01:14:33.685 --> 01:14:39.287]  That's why they're calling for us to be taken off the air right now on NPR this morning, because we questioned it.
[01:14:39.407 --> 01:14:40.307]  You don't do that.
[01:14:40.408 --> 01:14:41.928]  Only NPR does the thinking.
[01:14:43.209 --> 01:14:47.090]  And that nice, soft voice of car, go to sleep.
[01:14:47.844 --> 01:14:48.969]  Let me hypnotize you.
[01:14:50.535 --> 01:14:52.162]  Please don't forget, we have.
[01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:55.751]  A lot of amazing deals on the site.
[01:14:55.771 --> 01:14:57.212]  We still have store-wide free shipping.
[01:14:57.512 --> 01:15:00.435]  We had to end all those big discounts on the supplements.
[01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:06.680]  We're about to sell out of all of them, but we still have a big discount going, even though it's about to sell out on DNA Force, our flagship amazing product.
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.181]  Check out DNA Force.

[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:22.460]  It should be.
[01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:26.162]  DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more.
[01:15:26.662 --> 01:15:27.823]  And all apparel.
[01:15:27.863 --> 01:15:28.763]  We only do this once a year.

[01:15:57.654 --> 01:15:59.334]  It's discounted, but it's about to sell out.
[01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:03.256]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:05.237 --> 01:16:14.640]  I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.581]  So please, bear with me a few minutes.
[01:16:19.073 --> 01:16:24.857]  Because this is just bubbling up to my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[01:16:25.697 --> 01:16:27.719]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:40.567]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California like we're different football teams and we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[01:16:41.828 --> 01:16:42.369]  This is not
[01:16:43.815 --> 01:16:46.157]  Alex Jones is a tribalist going, woo!
[01:16:46.597 --> 01:16:48.359]  Texas is way better than California.
[01:16:48.599 --> 01:16:49.340]  F-California.
[01:16:50.781 --> 01:16:55.205]  California, until about 30 years ago, was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[01:16:56.386 --> 01:17:00.869]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:03.051]  The 49ers, all of it.
[01:17:03.111 --> 01:17:06.314]  I mean, the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[01:17:07.715 --> 01:17:11.879]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[01:17:13.763 --> 01:17:23.574]  The Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is a skeleton of its former self.
[01:17:24.876 --> 01:17:31.223]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue, and most political experts agree,
[01:17:33.564 --> 01:17:36.306]  24.
[01:17:33.925 --> 01:17:36.306]  Texas will be deep blue.
[01:17:37.246 --> 01:17:38.827]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[01:17:39.308 --> 01:17:46.472]  But, as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[01:17:46.712 --> 01:17:49.513]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[01:17:50.954 --> 01:17:51.835]  That's a whole other history book.
[01:17:52.875 --> 01:18:01.080]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, it's not a positive thing.
[01:18:02.773 --> 01:18:14.286]  It's not something I celebrate, it's like whistling past the graveyard, but... The carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California, because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians.
[01:18:15.007 --> 01:18:16.909]  They ruined that incredible state.
[01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:19.712]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[01:18:21.212 --> 01:18:29.957]  And now like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-Boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[01:18:30.397 --> 01:18:47.848]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California, Buy USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[01:18:48.945 --> 01:18:57.627]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:03.408]  The globalists want info wars shut down because they can track back.
[01:19:03.508 --> 01:19:05.428]  Almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[01:19:06.128 --> 01:19:08.989]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do.
[01:19:09.289 --> 01:19:10.229]  Probably resonate together.
[01:19:10.869 --> 01:19:13.870]  And I'm telling you, this don't California, my USA.
[01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:16.891]  This don't California, my Texas, is the answer.
[01:19:17.131 --> 01:19:18.351]  The people have to be warned.
[01:19:18.911 --> 01:19:26.093]  We have 10 different limited edition shirts at mfullerstore.com right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[01:19:26.793 --> 01:19:28.594]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[01:19:29.554 --> 01:19:33.496]  And so, for the next week or so, while supplies last, 50% off.
[01:19:33.516 --> 01:19:37.957]  That means I'm making $5 on these shirts from the mFuller.
[01:19:38.397 --> 01:19:44.659]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[01:19:44.879 --> 01:19:54.282]  Infowarsstore.com and look at the 10 limited edition Don't California my USA, Don't California Texas.
[01:19:54.682 --> 01:19:56.702]  And I welcome folks to say Don't California Florida.
[01:19:56.942 --> 01:19:59.403]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[01:19:59.763 --> 01:20:01.144]  We can do it if we take action.
[01:20:01.324 --> 01:20:02.484]  We can save America.
[01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:09.142]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.587 --> 01:20:22.831]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:25.396 --> 01:20:27.938]  You may remember her as the Kent State Gun Girl.
[01:20:27.998 --> 01:20:31.540]  She posed with an AR-10 rifle at her Kent State graduation last year.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:37.023]  But yesterday, Caitlin Bennett says she was kicked out of the Bernie Sanders campaign event without explanation.
[01:20:37.303 --> 01:20:40.385]  She spoke with Matt Stone today about why she thinks it happened.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:53.905]  Since Kent grad Caitlin Bennett took those gun pics on campus last year, she's been busy speaking out for conservative causes and recently being hired by the infowars.com website as a reporter.
[01:20:54.505 --> 01:21:00.628]  That's why she showed up at the Bernie Sanders campaign stop in Lordstown, a rally that was supposed to be public.
[01:21:01.175 --> 01:21:02.916]  I asked them, did I violate any rules?
[01:21:02.956 --> 01:21:03.777]  Did I do anything?
[01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:04.718]  Am I a disturbance?
[01:21:05.278 --> 01:21:06.599]  No, I was scrolling on Facebook.
[01:21:06.859 --> 01:21:09.481]  They simply didn't want me there because they know who I am.
[01:21:09.881 --> 01:21:12.603]  And I believe that event was staged.
[01:21:12.683 --> 01:21:17.367]  They had plants in the audience that were supposed to ask the questions.
[01:21:17.407 --> 01:21:22.811]  Bernie was scripted with the responses, and they didn't want anybody else to try to ask him questions.
[01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:28.255]  Bennett says she would have asked Sanders if he supports free health care for illegal immigrants.
[01:21:29.039 --> 01:21:31.561]  So I'm being ejected from a public event?
[01:21:31.641 --> 01:21:37.306]  Instead she says she was told to leave the public event, which she did, with no explanation as to why.
[01:21:37.907 --> 01:21:41.409]  She says she's never been a disturbance at any event she's covered before.
[01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:48.315]  We called the Sanders campaign to ask specifically why they had removed her, and they wouldn't answer the question directly.
[01:21:49.136 --> 01:21:51.097]  Instead, they gave us the following statement.
[01:21:51.798 --> 01:21:52.739]  We are disappointed.
[01:21:52.799 --> 01:22:07.752]  The people of the Youngstown community are being shown on the local broadcast news content from InfoWars, a white supremacist platform that has been banned from YouTube, Apple, and Facebook for hate speech and targeting the parents of children who died in Sandy Hook.
[01:22:08.413 --> 01:22:10.935]  Okay, so none of that is true.
[01:22:11.776 --> 01:22:12.857]  And now they can just add on.
[01:22:12.897 --> 01:22:18.082]  Now it's white supremacists, not just child endangerment or all these other things they've made up.
[01:22:19.984 --> 01:22:23.105]  And this is because they threw a woman who they know who she is.
[01:22:23.926 --> 01:22:27.147]  Her video has 12.7 million views on Twitter.
[01:22:28.768 --> 01:22:30.028]  It has millions of views on YouTube.
[01:22:30.048 --> 01:22:32.209]  That's way more than any of Sanders' videos do.
[01:22:32.529 --> 01:22:34.270]  She routinely has that many viewers.
[01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:35.691]  And they're scared of her.
[01:22:37.051 --> 01:22:38.872]  And so she was there just to show what he said.
[01:22:38.892 --> 01:22:41.453]  And to show what he did.
[01:22:41.893 --> 01:22:43.274]  And the police even said, we're sorry.
[01:22:43.854 --> 01:22:44.814]  They were acting as private security.
[01:22:45.275 --> 01:22:45.975]  We think this is wrong.
[01:22:46.015 --> 01:22:46.755]  We apologize.
[01:22:47.316 --> 01:22:48.096]  You've done nothing wrong.
[01:22:49.406 --> 01:23:04.262]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen, thrown out, and then their answer is to not just crap on Caitlyn and the First Amendment, but then rub it in and say that it's a white supremist organization.
[01:23:06.437 --> 01:23:08.418]  It's lawsuit time, but we just don't have the funds.
[01:23:08.478 --> 01:23:09.198]  People need to support us.
[01:23:09.558 --> 01:23:12.099]  We've got to stand up against this monster.
[01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.200]  He is such an anti-American.
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.380]  He supports Venezuela.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:16.981]  He supported Fidel Castro.
[01:23:17.281 --> 01:23:19.661]  He literally honeymooned in the Soviet Union.
[01:23:20.862 --> 01:23:27.144]  He was kicked off a commune in Israel because they said he wouldn't work and was fondling all the women.
[01:23:27.304 --> 01:23:27.764]  Look it up!
[01:23:29.865 --> 01:23:30.505]  I don't work.
[01:23:30.645 --> 01:23:31.605]  The women are mine.
[01:23:32.005 --> 01:23:32.486]  I sit here.
[01:23:32.506 --> 01:23:33.246]  I drink wine.
[01:23:34.353 --> 01:23:35.975]  And you do what I say.
[01:23:36.335 --> 01:23:38.156]  So, Caitlin, we salute you and your great work.
[01:23:38.216 --> 01:23:39.577]  You and, of course, Millie Weaver that were there.
[01:23:39.858 --> 01:23:41.099]  She was able to stay inside.
[01:23:42.099 --> 01:23:46.042]  But you are hitting the zeitgeist here every single time.
[01:23:46.463 --> 01:23:47.624]  And, of course, you're interviewing the local news.
[01:23:47.664 --> 01:23:48.724]  They did a pretty fair job.
[01:23:48.784 --> 01:23:50.826]  But white supremacists?
[01:23:50.886 --> 01:23:53.008]  I mean, it's just unbelievable what the Democrats do.
[01:23:54.383 --> 01:23:57.526]  Well, what's really funny is that they say that it's a white supremacist platform.
[01:23:57.546 --> 01:24:00.829]  They're indirectly calling me specifically a white supremacist.
[01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:06.414]  And then CBS comes out with the show, The Good Fight, and they have on their punch Nazis.
[01:24:06.755 --> 01:24:08.416]  So what are they trying to say?
[01:24:08.436 --> 01:24:10.218]  They're calling me a white supremacist.
[01:24:10.558 --> 01:24:11.739]  That leads to violence.
[01:24:11.759 --> 01:24:15.260]  That leads to people getting punched and violently assaulted in public.
[01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.101]  So I don't know, do they want me to get hurt?
[01:24:17.441 --> 01:24:20.622]  Is this an indirect way of saying, go out and hurt Caitlyn Bennett?
[01:24:21.142 --> 01:24:22.483]  There's so many levels to this.
[01:24:22.503 --> 01:24:32.186]  But I think the most amazing part of the statement is that they're disappointed that the people of Youngstown are being shown content from InfoWars.
[01:24:32.266 --> 01:24:35.428]  They don't want people to watch InfoWars, and you have to wonder why.
[01:24:35.828 --> 01:24:38.349]  They don't want the truth getting out to these people.
[01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:41.032]  You know, you just hit the nail on the head, as you always do.
[01:24:41.052 --> 01:24:54.225]  They're saying... We are disappointed they are looking at that content that was raw, unedited footage of us throwing a woman out, a female reporter, a bunch of men, for no reason!
[01:24:55.146 --> 01:24:56.207]  I mean, exactly.
[01:24:56.247 --> 01:24:57.307]  It's just raw footage.
[01:24:57.588 --> 01:24:58.328]  You're a reporter.
[01:24:58.568 --> 01:25:01.930]  And just because they say we're white supremacists or did these things we didn't do, doesn't matter.
[01:25:02.191 --> 01:25:07.174]  But even if we did, CNN helped lie about the WMDs and the babies in incubators that killed millions.
[01:25:07.534 --> 01:25:09.855]  They helped lie and try to start race wars.
[01:25:10.175 --> 01:25:13.197]  So, by that yardstick, no one should be able to even see CNN.
[01:25:13.357 --> 01:25:19.381]  But see, CNN has to pay hotels and train stations and airports to make people watch it.
[01:25:19.621 --> 01:25:22.143]  It's different with InfoWars and the great Caitlin Bennett.
[01:25:23.593 --> 01:25:29.297]  It's just, it's really disappointing, and I feel, if there's any viewers from Youngstown out there, this should really concern you.
[01:25:29.317 --> 01:25:36.983]  It should concern everybody that the Bernie Sanders campaign is blatantly saying they don't want people to watch InfoWars, and it's a good point.
[01:25:37.063 --> 01:25:38.143]  It was unedited.
[01:25:38.163 --> 01:25:39.144]  It was uncut.
[01:25:39.184 --> 01:25:41.466]  It was just a video filmed on a phone.
[01:25:41.766 --> 01:25:43.609]  Because we didn't go in there with camera equipment.
[01:25:43.829 --> 01:25:46.853]  We just went in there to listen and ask a question.
[01:25:47.314 --> 01:25:50.458]  But of course, they felt threatened just by my presence.
[01:25:50.498 --> 01:25:54.223]  And I'm surprised that they didn't notice Millie because she was right in front of me.
[01:25:54.604 --> 01:25:57.328]  So if it was invite only, Millie would have been kicked out too.
[01:25:57.848 --> 01:25:58.248]  Right away.
[01:25:58.288 --> 01:25:59.489]  She ended up getting kicked out later.
[01:25:59.809 --> 01:26:03.490]  But, you know, they fling those words around, white supremacist, Nazi.
[01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:11.013]  That's one thing, but to blatantly say that they don't want the people of Youngstown to be watching InfoWars is completely different.
[01:26:11.354 --> 01:26:14.755]  There's so many levels to this statement.
[01:26:14.855 --> 01:26:22.098]  It's a short statement, but there's so many levels that you really just have to dissect it because there's a meaning in each sentence that they say.
[01:26:22.591 --> 01:26:23.012]  That's right.
[01:26:23.593 --> 01:26:25.455]  It's the standard Democrat Party line.
[01:26:25.475 --> 01:26:26.837]  You're not allowed to see Infowars.
[01:26:26.877 --> 01:26:27.759]  We're for censorship.
[01:26:28.199 --> 01:26:29.201]  We kicked her out.
[01:26:29.722 --> 01:26:30.983]  We didn't let her cover the event.
[01:26:31.043 --> 01:26:33.307]  And now we don't want you to show the public what happened.
[01:26:33.527 --> 01:26:38.014]  But it looks like the local news station of their credit did not buy into this bull and saw through it.
[01:26:38.871 --> 01:26:47.741]  Oh yeah, they completely said, you know, here's the statement, and I love that they added in there, they didn't answer the question directly of why she was kicked out.
[01:26:47.781 --> 01:26:49.383]  I'm so glad they put that in there.
[01:26:49.724 --> 01:26:56.612]  They were very respectful when they came to interview me, very non-biased, and I couldn't be more hopeful.
[01:26:57.112 --> 01:26:58.473]  Sanders dehumanized you.
[01:26:58.733 --> 01:27:03.677]  And we see with Gamergate and all this where they say, oh, we want all the heroines, all the heroes to be women.
[01:27:03.957 --> 01:27:04.938]  We want women in command.
[01:27:05.018 --> 01:27:05.318]  Great!
[01:27:05.698 --> 01:27:07.260]  I've got three daughters and one son.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.281]  I want women to do anything my son can do or greater.
[01:27:09.801 --> 01:27:14.825]  The point is, is that the left just thinks they own black people and women, and minorities is what it comes down to.
[01:27:14.845 --> 01:27:21.490]  And then when it really comes to women being empowered, they treat women like absolute crap, I've noticed, when Trump's put more women in power than any other president ever.
[01:27:22.458 --> 01:27:30.783]  Well, they do that to Candace Owens, but Candace Owens really, you know, stuck the middle finger up to Congress when they were trying to beat her down and lie about her.
[01:27:31.123 --> 01:27:31.703]  It's amazing.
[01:27:31.763 --> 01:27:39.908]  And it's a double whammy because she's a black woman, so they really don't like it when she's out there proving them wrong, proving that they don't have to be Democrats.
[01:27:40.468 --> 01:27:43.190]  And they don't like it, so they have to make sure they shut them down.
[01:27:43.230 --> 01:27:47.072]  What's funny is if Bernie and his campaign just let me sit in the audience,
[01:27:47.492 --> 01:27:50.233]  I wouldn't have gained 12,000 new followers.
[01:27:50.473 --> 01:27:53.414]  This wouldn't have gotten the attention of millions of people.
[01:27:53.694 --> 01:27:55.314]  And it wouldn't even be a story right now.
[01:27:55.614 --> 01:27:57.715]  So they're so stupid that they don't understand.
[01:27:58.015 --> 01:27:59.315]  Just let people listen.
[01:27:59.335 --> 01:28:00.275]  Just let people watch.
[01:28:00.415 --> 01:28:02.896]  Don't be the cause of a disturbance.
[01:28:02.916 --> 01:28:05.997]  Because, if anything, they disturbed their own event.
[01:28:06.037 --> 01:28:12.478]  Because instead of what Bernie was saying being on the news, it's what his campaign staff did against me that's on the news.
[01:28:13.078 --> 01:28:15.419]  And they shoot themselves in the foot every time.
[01:28:16.167 --> 01:28:27.899]  And you're well-spoken, you're a lady, just like Millie Weaver, and you guys always knock it out of the park because you were calm, you were polite, they have nothing to claim you did that was wrong, no reason to censor you, and that's why they're paralyzed.
[01:28:27.939 --> 01:28:29.820]  So they go, okay, she's a white supremacist.
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:36.847]  When we come back, I want to give you a chance to speak directly to the Sanders campaign and to Sanders to retract this.
[01:28:37.848 --> 01:28:38.948]  Because I'm not bluffing.
[01:28:38.988 --> 01:28:39.849]  I've sued a few people.
[01:28:39.869 --> 01:28:41.469]  We're looking at a bunch of other lawsuits.
[01:28:41.929 --> 01:28:46.750]  And I think this is one that needs to be done if Sanders doesn't retract saying we're white supremacists because it's dangerous.
[01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:49.691]  And as you said, they have CBS shows saying attack Nazis.
[01:28:50.031 --> 01:28:52.091]  Well, if they say we're Nazis, we're going to get attacked.
[01:28:52.131 --> 01:28:57.533]  So Sanders, you're inciting violence against us and literally want us to be hunted down and killed.
[01:28:58.073 --> 01:28:59.993]  Shame on you, you authoritarian monster!
[01:29:05.003 --> 01:29:09.464]  Melatonin's on average $19, $19.95 a bottle, and a lot of it's not even organic type.
[01:29:09.684 --> 01:29:14.405]  I talked to the big organic producer companies that we have make it, and I said, how much money is really in that?
[01:29:14.985 --> 01:29:20.846]  They said, on average, about maybe $1 a melatonin, and then the container costs $0.50 or so, or less.
[01:29:21.246 --> 01:29:33.848]  And I said, so I can put the same amount of melatonin in, just make it a bigger capsule that's powdered so you actually absorb it, and then add L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm, chamomile, and then you get a sleep.
[01:29:34.608 --> 01:29:43.315]  Unlike other systems, I mean, Randall Wilhite, his name is on the Texas Family Code, the last four or five issues, and he writes the Texas Law of the Family Code.
[01:29:43.335 --> 01:29:45.217]  He's one of the top family law lawyers in the country.
[01:29:45.537 --> 01:29:46.678]  The point is, he's a smart guy.
[01:29:46.698 --> 01:29:47.919]  He doesn't smoke marijuana.
[01:29:47.939 --> 01:29:49.340]  He doesn't drink anything.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.020]  He goes, man, I gotta really thank you.
[01:29:51.541 --> 01:29:53.141]  I am sleeping eight hours through the night.
[01:29:53.161 --> 01:29:54.942]  I only have to take one knockout.
[01:29:55.302 --> 01:29:57.902]  I've gone and showed, you know, UT Science this and everything else.
[01:29:57.942 --> 01:29:58.803]  This is insane.
[01:29:59.203 --> 01:30:00.823]  I said, yeah, you look 10 years younger.
[01:30:01.083 --> 01:30:03.644]  He said, oh yeah, it's just, I'm off all the sleep drugs.
[01:30:04.084 --> 01:30:05.604]  He says, this is totally free.
[01:30:05.645 --> 01:30:07.465]  But he goes, do you know what it is in there?
[01:30:07.485 --> 01:30:09.346]  And I said, it's the synergy of it.
[01:30:10.206 --> 01:30:16.147]  Of the chamomile, the lemon balm, the L-tryptophan, the valerian root, the melatonin, and several other ingredients.
[01:30:16.388 --> 01:30:17.728]  All just moderate dose.
[01:30:19.261 --> 01:30:27.245]  They're all the recommended dose, and they just fuse together, and whatever they do chemically in the brain, that Mother Nature, God gave us our Mother Nature, is incredible.
[01:30:27.265 --> 01:30:29.667]  So, that's available infullwarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:30:29.707 --> 01:30:30.847]  But thank you for committing.
[01:30:34.918 --> 01:30:37.739]  To get the great products, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you name it.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:40.721]  But it takes selling a lot of stuff to be able to fund this.
[01:30:40.741 --> 01:30:45.503]  We're not like raiding countries like George Soros and stealing billions and then, you know, funding race war.
[01:30:45.963 --> 01:30:55.248]  It's just selling t-shirts, selling books, selling films and, you know, just hustling to be able to get high quality products out so you have a great response and reorder, reorder, reorder, reorder.
[01:30:55.568 --> 01:30:56.889]  It's called reap what you show.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:11.661]  And let's go to Lucas in North Carolina.
[01:31:11.681 --> 01:31:13.122]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:31:13.402 --> 01:31:14.062]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:31:14.102 --> 01:31:14.602]  Good to be on.
[01:31:14.622 --> 01:31:15.383]  Good to have you here.
[01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:19.765]  Real quickly, I just wanted to say that I am a user of the Infowars products.
[01:31:20.045 --> 01:31:22.346]  First, I started with Supermail Vitality.
[01:31:22.366 --> 01:31:29.869]  I am a late 30s male, and I don't get all the time that I would like to work out as much as I do, and immediately noticed
[01:31:30.289 --> 01:31:35.770]  Being able to retain strength and muscle mass from the use of super male vitality, so I want to thank you for that.
[01:31:35.911 --> 01:31:41.952]  Also, I bought the t-shirt, Reelect45, and Hillary for Prison, obviously, one of the most popular.
[01:31:41.972 --> 01:31:47.073]  It's drawn so much attention, and I don't know if people believe it or not, but it's all positive attention.
[01:31:47.133 --> 01:31:53.455]  The main reaction that I got myself was from males 18 to 20 years old and middle-aged black women.
[01:31:53.655 --> 01:31:57.096]  Honestly, God, they were the ones commenting saying, I love that shirt.
[01:31:57.136 --> 01:31:59.897]  They would laugh about it, tell their friends about it.
[01:31:59.977 --> 01:32:11.440]  And, uh, next I tried X2 and, uh, it's nothing that you notice immediately, but it seemed over time, I felt like I was more sharp from the iodine, being able to retain a short term memory better.
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:14.601]  I just feel a little sharper in my day to day activities.
[01:32:14.881 --> 01:32:16.462]  I totally, I totally agree with you.
[01:32:16.582 --> 01:32:18.404]  Again, it's the good halogen.
[01:32:18.584 --> 01:32:21.666]  IQs get reduced by 15 points without iodine.
[01:32:21.746 --> 01:32:23.708]  In your development, people can look this up for themselves.
[01:32:24.148 --> 01:32:28.471]  And that's why the globalists are obsessed with making sure it's not in the food, it's not in the products we eat.
[01:32:28.872 --> 01:32:30.453]  We are just starving for iodine.
[01:32:30.473 --> 01:32:31.494]  That's why we came out with X2.
[01:32:31.534 --> 01:32:33.495]  We have X3 that's all three types.
[01:32:33.515 --> 01:32:34.836]  This is the deep-earth crystal source.
[01:32:34.896 --> 01:32:36.157]  We don't have it back in stock.
[01:32:36.257 --> 01:32:38.359]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.721]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the sub page.
[01:32:40.981 --> 01:32:42.261]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:20.362 --> 01:33:22.344]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:22.725 --> 01:33:24.086]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.812 --> 01:33:33.696]  Is it alright to hit a Nazi unprovoked?
[01:33:33.876 --> 01:33:35.738]  I was always taught to never throw the first punch.
[01:33:35.858 --> 01:33:36.618]  Never instigate.
[01:33:36.899 --> 01:33:37.880]  Defendant, don't attack.
[01:33:38.871 --> 01:33:56.459]  But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face during an interview, and I realized... Spencer was in a press suit, wearing a tie, being interviewed like his opinion mattered, like he should be considered part of the conversation, like neo-Nazism was just one political point of view.
[01:33:56.759 --> 01:34:01.821]  And then I realized... There's no better way to show some speech is not equal!
[01:34:02.601 --> 01:34:05.202]  Some speech requires a more visceral response.
[01:34:05.502 --> 01:34:06.742]  It's like Overton's Window.
[01:34:06.762 --> 01:34:10.143]  That's the term from which ideas are tolerated in public discourse.
[01:34:10.263 --> 01:34:14.965]  Well, Overton's Window doesn't mean s*** unless it comes with some enforcement, so yeah!
[01:34:15.685 --> 01:34:16.765]  This is enforcement.
[01:34:17.785 --> 01:34:19.566]  It's time to punch a few Nazis.
[01:34:20.786 --> 01:34:22.267]  Wow, that's CBS.
[01:34:35.204 --> 01:34:43.746]  So, CBS Radio Listener has a new TV show coming out where it shows rioting whites and blacks beating up supposedly racist white people.
[01:34:44.126 --> 01:34:45.807]  Anybody the news says is a Nazi.
[01:34:46.627 --> 01:34:50.308]  Then it shows real footage of white nationalists being physically attacked.
[01:34:50.328 --> 01:34:54.189]  Mr. Spencer, I don't agree with his views, but I believe in his First Amendment.
[01:34:55.189 --> 01:35:01.311]  And you've got this arrogant, aggressive, basically black racist nationalist trying to invoke a race war.
[01:35:02.113 --> 01:35:04.675]  So that's their answer to Trump being up in the polls.
[01:35:04.715 --> 01:35:06.656]  That's their answer to people rejecting open borders.
[01:35:07.077 --> 01:35:08.417]  That's their answer to globalism.
[01:35:09.018 --> 01:35:11.219]  And so Trump's like, here, you just take all the illegals in your city.
[01:35:11.319 --> 01:35:12.100]  Oh no, it's a threat!
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:12.700]  It's dangerous!
[01:35:14.822 --> 01:35:16.083]  CBS drama, The Good Fight.
[01:35:16.943 --> 01:35:18.885]  Tweet with, assassinate Trump.
[01:35:18.965 --> 01:35:21.306]  Oh yeah, they're also tweeting, assassinate Trump.
[01:35:21.747 --> 01:35:28.872]  CBS has mainline dinnertime shows that you're supposed to turn on
[01:35:31.218 --> 01:35:41.661]  Showing actors in simulated riots attacking white people, cut in with real footage of white people unprovoked being attacked, but it's okay because they're Nazis.
[01:35:43.402 --> 01:35:47.463]  And meanwhile, the whole leftist group is funded by George Soros, an actual Nazi collaborator.
[01:35:48.884 --> 01:35:56.586]  Well, what they're trying to do is to get enough dumb people to go out and attack white folks, so white folks start shooting back, so they can cause a civil war.
[01:35:58.689 --> 01:36:02.411]  So understand, the pawns in this are the minorities they're trying to manipulate.
[01:36:02.471 --> 01:36:05.613]  And the good news is, you go to any Lepus event, it's 90% white.
[01:36:05.633 --> 01:36:09.856]  Bunch of professors trying to get blacks and others to riot.
[01:36:09.876 --> 01:36:12.297]  Remember the documents we got in January of last year?
[01:36:12.317 --> 01:36:14.578]  Now, uh, 16 months ago?
[01:36:15.279 --> 01:36:18.241]  Secret, internal George Soros documents from Alexander Soros.
[01:36:18.841 --> 01:36:25.585]  How to have professors dressed up in black in Maryland and other cities attack pre, pre,
[01:36:27.964 --> 01:36:28.464]  Place places.
[01:36:28.484 --> 01:36:29.845]  They had agreements with Starbucks, everybody.
[01:36:30.145 --> 01:36:33.326]  Always wonder why they knock over a trash can, attack Starbucks and McDonald's.
[01:36:33.346 --> 01:36:35.286]  They have pre-agreements, they won't press charges.
[01:36:36.167 --> 01:36:37.827]  And they talk about the scripting points.
[01:36:38.247 --> 01:36:38.907]  They are actors.
[01:36:39.308 --> 01:36:40.108]  But it's real attacks.
[01:36:40.428 --> 01:36:42.209]  You'll burn this trash can, you'll attack that.
[01:36:44.369 --> 01:36:49.731]  And then they're in blue cities where the police commanders are in on it, but the local low-level police aren't.
[01:36:50.836 --> 01:36:53.959]  Documents to Tell, Plan for Civil Unrest, and Martial Law in Baltimore.
[01:36:54.379 --> 01:36:57.482]  Obama wanted to get nationwide martial law and stay in office, but he failed.
[01:36:57.842 --> 01:37:00.125]  Because black folks didn't riot the way they wanted to.
[01:37:00.145 --> 01:37:02.907]  Remember all the Trayvon Martin stuff?
[01:37:02.967 --> 01:37:04.028]  Using any case they could.
[01:37:04.128 --> 01:37:06.010]  All the hyped up stuff in Ferguson.
[01:37:06.871 --> 01:37:14.478]  All the weird buses pulling up with, you know, white professors going, ding dong, kill the cops, you know, deck the halls with dead cops.
[01:37:15.078 --> 01:37:15.979]  Jingle bells, jingle bells.
[01:37:16.019 --> 01:37:16.580]  Remember all that?
[01:37:17.756 --> 01:37:24.519]  And then cops would get killed in Dallas, they'd get killed in, you know, areas of Louisiana, and they'd say, well, cops are bad, they deserve to die.
[01:37:24.759 --> 01:37:27.080]  When they start behaving better, they'll stop dying.
[01:37:29.021 --> 01:37:34.704]  The left thought that if they funded a bunch of cops getting killed, the cops would go into the Strong Cities Initiative and Obama to stop it.
[01:37:34.924 --> 01:37:35.424]  The cops didn't.
[01:37:35.444 --> 01:37:39.106]  The cops went from being somewhat lapdogs of the system to now being against it.
[01:37:39.686 --> 01:37:41.127]  So good job there.
[01:37:43.027 --> 01:37:44.048]  But then there's Caitlyn Bennett.
[01:37:45.140 --> 01:37:47.341]  I haven't even counted up all the views she's got.
[01:37:47.362 --> 01:37:48.442]  500 million, a billion views.
[01:37:48.462 --> 01:37:50.323]  I don't know by now, almost everything she does gets a million views.
[01:37:50.644 --> 01:37:52.505]  Routinely every week, 15, 20 million views.
[01:37:52.885 --> 01:37:54.706]  Like she just got on this, just politely there.
[01:37:55.947 --> 01:37:57.448]  Grown men come over and say, get out of here.
[01:37:57.548 --> 01:37:58.309]  People laugh at her.
[01:37:58.409 --> 01:37:59.630]  Your guy didn't want it here.
[01:38:01.371 --> 01:38:02.051]  They throw her out.
[01:38:02.431 --> 01:38:03.732]  Now it's up to 13.1 million.
[01:38:03.752 --> 01:38:06.554]  That was 12.7 million just about 30 minutes ago.
[01:38:07.295 --> 01:38:12.758]  But about 20 million views right now total on that video of the InfoWars.com reporter, Caitlin Bennett.
[01:38:12.778 --> 01:38:13.699]  You can follow her at
[01:38:14.926 --> 01:38:17.669]  The Twitter site you see right there on screen.
[01:38:17.709 --> 01:38:19.411]  I'll give that up for radio listeners in a moment.
[01:38:19.451 --> 01:38:20.412]  But it doesn't matter, folks.
[01:38:20.432 --> 01:38:24.978]  The point is she has a home here at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, no matter what they do.
[01:38:25.058 --> 01:38:28.321]  But instead of saying, OK, what happened is wrong.
[01:38:29.514 --> 01:38:34.958]  They say, she is a white supremacist who is mean to Sandy Hook children.
[01:38:35.538 --> 01:38:36.559]  We are ashamed.
[01:38:36.579 --> 01:38:37.379]  No, that's true.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.843]  We are ashamed that local news NBC would show the footage.
[01:38:43.223 --> 01:38:47.807]  Let us bully women and cover it up or I call you Nazi.
[01:38:49.096 --> 01:38:49.516]  That's right!
[01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:51.038]  America defeated the Nazis!
[01:38:51.418 --> 01:38:57.444]  But I will say you are a Nazi if you don't do what I and my Nazi financiers say!
[01:38:58.164 --> 01:39:00.847]  So, Caitlin Bennett, I'm sorry, I will stop talking like Bernie Sanders.
[01:39:01.387 --> 01:39:05.271]  How would you like to respond to be targeted for death by Bernie Sanders?
[01:39:05.551 --> 01:39:06.712]  Would you like to give him a message?
[01:39:07.753 --> 01:39:08.234]  I would.
[01:39:08.334 --> 01:39:11.617]  So, this is directly for Bernie and his campaign.
[01:39:12.436 --> 01:39:15.559]  One, I reject the label of a white supremacist.
[01:39:15.579 --> 01:39:17.320]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:20.382]  I have never aligned myself with any of that ideology.
[01:39:20.402 --> 01:39:25.887]  And I think it's very dangerous to start calling private citizens a white supremacist.
[01:39:26.147 --> 01:39:27.448]  You're running for president.
[01:39:27.932 --> 01:39:36.056]  The last thing you should be doing is calling private citizens who are there to listen to your town hall meeting a white supremacist.
[01:39:36.336 --> 01:39:37.476]  We know what goes on.
[01:39:37.756 --> 01:39:43.619]  We know that violence is instigated towards people who are labeled white supremacists when they're not.
[01:39:44.292 --> 01:39:48.075]  Another thing you need to do is you need to answer the question directly.
[01:39:48.255 --> 01:39:49.856]  Why was I kicked out?
[01:39:50.257 --> 01:39:51.678]  Did I disturb anybody?
[01:39:51.958 --> 01:39:55.601]  Did I cause any type of uneasy feeling?
[01:39:55.641 --> 01:39:56.902]  Did you just not want me there?
[01:39:57.062 --> 01:39:58.783]  These are questions that need to be answered.
[01:39:59.064 --> 01:40:03.147]  If Trump can potentially be sued for blocking someone on Twitter,
[01:40:03.587 --> 01:40:16.054]  Because he's an elected official, he is the president, and you're barring somebody from hearing his message, then why is it I'm allowed to be ejected from someone's public event that's running for president?
[01:40:16.374 --> 01:40:21.277]  What are you so scared of that you don't want people to see InfoWars and their content?
[01:40:21.517 --> 01:40:27.661]  These are all questions that need to be answered from Bernie and his campaign, and a retraction needs to be issued
[01:40:28.041 --> 01:40:33.846]  For him calling me and calling InfoWars a white supremacist and we are a white supremacist platform.
[01:40:34.066 --> 01:40:44.274]  So these are demands that literally need to be met and they need to be met soon because it's disgusting and like Alex said, maybe there'll be a lawsuit that's filed up.
[01:40:46.039 --> 01:40:48.762]  And let's remember, they did this to Candace Owens last week.
[01:40:49.203 --> 01:41:00.735]  They said that she loved Hitler and had edited tape when she's anti-Hitler and won a major lawsuit when white supremacists actually threatened her and threatened physical harm against her and things we won't get into in Connecticut because they settled the case.
[01:41:01.796 --> 01:41:02.557]  I know her well.
[01:41:02.657 --> 01:41:14.932]  She's talked about the story she went through as a child and the fact that they would then try to say a black woman raised in the South with her grandfather grew up on a basically a plantation and then he raised her to say that she loves Hitler.
[01:41:15.372 --> 01:41:17.074]  This is the new thing about these monsters.
[01:41:17.114 --> 01:41:18.096]  They're just monsters.
[01:41:19.619 --> 01:41:22.881]  Well, what's sad is that it was Congress doing it.
[01:41:22.901 --> 01:41:25.643]  It wasn't even just the media.
[01:41:25.783 --> 01:41:27.565]  It wasn't even just people on Twitter.
[01:41:27.585 --> 01:41:30.887]  Because that already happened with the media and Twitter against Candace.
[01:41:31.267 --> 01:41:33.249]  Now it's members of Congress doing it.
[01:41:33.509 --> 01:41:34.830]  These are our elected officials.
[01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:38.712]  These are people running our country, making laws, influencing people.
[01:41:39.193 --> 01:41:40.894]  I don't understand how we've gotten to this point.
[01:41:40.914 --> 01:41:41.775]  Oh, that's the playbook is race war.
[01:41:41.795 --> 01:41:42.235]  Look, look, look.
[01:41:42.555 --> 01:41:46.057]  The Christian ethos said, open a society up, unify around values.
[01:41:46.437 --> 01:41:47.357]  The Democrats never liked that.
[01:41:47.377 --> 01:41:48.037]  They were the KKK.
[01:41:48.357 --> 01:41:49.878]  They said, oh, we can't beat this for now.
[01:41:50.278 --> 01:41:53.520]  Change the demographics, and then we think the minorities will be racist like us.
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.720]  And they just flipped to that new race paradigm.
[01:41:56.281 --> 01:42:05.224]  And whether it's Congressman Lew or Maxine Waters or Chuckie Schumer or any of these people, Michael Moore, it's total race-based class war.
[01:42:05.244 --> 01:42:05.985]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[01:42:06.265 --> 01:42:07.745]  Three years ago, they said, we're losing.
[01:42:08.046 --> 01:42:11.107]  We've got to escalate culture and racial conflict.
[01:42:11.767 --> 01:42:19.556]  And so that's why they've got CBS News showing black people beating up white people and saying, let's have a race war, because there's Nazis everywhere.
[01:42:19.816 --> 01:42:24.342]  And then they're literally financed and run by a real live Nazi collaborator, Caitlin Bennett.
[01:42:24.622 --> 01:42:25.943]  People can obviously follow you on Twitter.
[01:42:25.963 --> 01:42:27.385]  Your videos are posted at Infowars.com.
[01:42:28.871 --> 01:42:34.316]  I think we were talking about this a few weeks ago, but you need to have your own big, clean website where everything Caitlyn Bennett is.
[01:42:34.336 --> 01:42:35.457]  We need that for Millie Weaver.
[01:42:35.957 --> 01:42:37.158]  I'd encourage you guys to do that.
[01:42:37.198 --> 01:42:42.503]  So let's come back, though, and I want to play a few more clips for you and ask where you think all this is going.
[01:42:42.543 --> 01:42:45.406]  But where are some of the other places people can find Caitlyn Bennett information?
[01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:48.952]  So we have LibertyHangout.org.
[01:42:49.092 --> 01:42:51.374]  It is a different website than InfoWars.
[01:42:51.514 --> 01:42:53.355]  All my stuff does go there as well.
[01:42:54.516 --> 01:42:58.419]  LibertyHangout's YouTube channel where we post all of our videos since InfoWars is banned.
[01:42:58.859 --> 01:43:13.811]  And then obviously InfoWars.com you can find... I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[01:43:14.231 --> 01:43:14.711]  So please
[01:43:15.711 --> 01:43:23.995]  Bear with me a few minutes because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[01:43:24.836 --> 01:43:26.857]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[01:43:28.618 --> 01:43:39.704]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California like we're different football teams and we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[01:43:40.984 --> 01:43:41.505]  This is not
[01:43:42.941 --> 01:43:45.303]  Alex Jones is a tribalist going, woo!
[01:43:45.723 --> 01:43:47.505]  Texas is way better than California.
[01:43:47.745 --> 01:43:48.506]  F-California.
[01:43:49.927 --> 01:43:54.331]  California, until about 30 years ago, was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[01:43:55.532 --> 01:44:00.015]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[01:44:00.636 --> 01:44:02.197]  The 49ers, all of it.
[01:44:02.257 --> 01:44:05.440]  I mean, the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[01:44:06.841 --> 01:44:10.604]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[01:44:13.018 --> 01:44:22.707]  Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is a skeleton of its former self.
[01:44:24.008 --> 01:44:28.432]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue, and most...
[01:44:29.420 --> 01:44:35.446]  Political experts agree by 2024, Texas will be deep blue.
[01:44:36.387 --> 01:44:37.988]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[01:44:38.449 --> 01:44:45.636]  But as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[01:44:45.856 --> 01:44:48.679]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:50.941]  That's a whole other history book.
[01:44:52.014 --> 01:45:00.257]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big, gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, it's not a positive thing.
[01:45:01.878 --> 01:45:03.279]  It's not something I celebrate.
[01:45:03.299 --> 01:45:04.779]  It's like whistling past the graveyard.
[01:45:04.899 --> 01:45:16.004]  But the carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California, because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians, they ruined that incredible state.
[01:45:16.824 --> 01:45:18.845]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[01:45:20.356 --> 01:45:29.100]  And now, like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:46.969]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California by USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[01:45:48.095 --> 01:45:56.739]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.562]  The globalists want info wars shut down because they can track back.
[01:46:02.642 --> 01:46:04.563]  Almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[01:46:05.264 --> 01:46:08.125]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do.
[01:46:08.425 --> 01:46:09.366]  Probably resonate together.
[01:46:10.006 --> 01:46:13.028]  And I'm telling you, this don't California, my USA.
[01:46:13.368 --> 01:46:16.029]  This don't California, my Texas is the answer.
[01:46:16.289 --> 01:46:17.510]  The people have to be warned.
[01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:25.238]  We have 10 different limited-edition shirts at MFootwearStore.com right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[01:46:25.859 --> 01:46:27.741]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[01:46:28.702 --> 01:46:34.629]  And so, for the next week or so, all supplies last 50% off.
[01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:37.112]  That means I'm making $5 on these shirts from the MFootwear.
[01:46:37.532 --> 01:46:43.793]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[01:46:44.013 --> 01:46:53.435]  Infowarsstore.com and look at the 10 limited edition Don't California my USA, Don't California Texas.
[01:46:53.915 --> 01:46:55.836]  Now welcome folks to say Don't California Florida.
[01:46:56.076 --> 01:46:58.556]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[01:46:58.896 --> 01:47:00.277]  We can do it if we take action.
[01:47:00.457 --> 01:47:01.617]  We can save America!
[01:47:05.842 --> 01:47:08.407]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:36.556 --> 01:47:38.277]  Monday through Friday, we're here for 11 a.m.
[01:47:38.377 --> 01:47:38.657]  to 3 p.m.
[01:47:38.697 --> 01:47:39.777]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:40.538 --> 01:47:53.424]  Everybody should beware when you get some old weird con artist that's never had a private sector job in their life, didn't get a paycheck until they were 40, was kicked out of a kibbutz out of a Jewish...
[01:47:54.284 --> 01:47:55.005]  He likes Venezuela?
[01:47:55.025 --> 01:47:55.485]  He likes Hugo Chavez?
[01:47:55.505 --> 01:47:56.125]  He likes Fidel Castro?
[01:47:56.145 --> 01:47:57.786]  He likes your money?
[01:47:57.826 --> 01:48:00.228]  He bankrupts colleges with his wife and steals the money?
[01:48:25.473 --> 01:48:33.481]  This is a raving criminal loon calling Caitlin Bennett a white supremacist after he had her thrown out of his rally.
[01:48:34.321 --> 01:48:37.104]  And then meanwhile... Free health care?
[01:48:38.885 --> 01:48:39.846]  Free education?
[01:48:41.087 --> 01:48:42.249]  Free housing?
[01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:45.091]  And I agree with AOC.
[01:48:46.072 --> 01:48:48.034]  If you do not want to work, you do not work.
[01:48:48.919 --> 01:48:56.422]  But those of you that are not part of the inner party, work camps for you to teach you the joy of under my whip.
[01:48:58.063 --> 01:49:00.304]  Now, there's a story up on Infowars.com.
[01:49:00.984 --> 01:49:03.405]  You've got Pelosi out saying AOC doesn't speak for us.
[01:49:03.925 --> 01:49:05.886]  There's only like five socialists in the leadership.
[01:49:06.907 --> 01:49:07.367]  Okay.
[01:49:08.487 --> 01:49:10.388]  Michael Moore destroys Pelosi.
[01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:14.330]  Her old, tired, privileged ways are over.
[01:49:15.965 --> 01:49:19.269]  You got more money than her, and you're missing nails.
[01:49:19.349 --> 01:49:21.551]  Why don't you go to Venezuela and help them out?
[01:49:22.612 --> 01:49:25.675]  But it's just all whipping up a big malice operation.
[01:49:25.875 --> 01:49:28.138]  Well, this is funded by big mega-banks that are tax-exempt.
[01:49:28.918 --> 01:49:36.987]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi needs to step aside and let the far-left take over the Democratic Party, said far-left filmmaker Michael Moore.
[01:49:37.968 --> 01:49:38.989]  It was worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:49:39.966 --> 01:49:47.490]  Moore tore into Pelosi after a 60-minute interview on Sunday where he bashed socialism, where she bashed socialism and far-left wing of her party.
[01:49:49.431 --> 01:49:51.432]  And he went on to say that socialism is the system.
[01:49:51.973 --> 01:49:53.714]  That story up on Infowars.com.
[01:49:54.454 --> 01:50:00.457]  So going back to Millie Weaver, because this is such a big deal, they've really jumped the shark with you.
[01:50:01.218 --> 01:50:05.260]  And you know, you were the Kent State gun girl a year and a half ago we got you on.
[01:50:06.898 --> 01:50:07.418]  You're a woman.
[01:50:07.438 --> 01:50:08.199]  You're a citizen.
[01:50:08.219 --> 01:50:10.620]  It's legal to have the open carry.
[01:50:11.161 --> 01:50:12.321]  They try to demonize you.
[01:50:12.882 --> 01:50:14.003]  All these so-called feminists.
[01:50:15.083 --> 01:50:16.644]  You're calling your own shots in your own life.
[01:50:16.784 --> 01:50:17.565]  That's what they don't like.
[01:50:17.605 --> 01:50:19.446]  And modern feminists does what the establishment says.
[01:50:19.466 --> 01:50:19.946]  They're slaves.
[01:50:20.607 --> 01:50:21.627]  They're controlled by the system.
[01:50:21.667 --> 01:50:27.731]  But why is your work all going so viral and they don't know how to handle you?
[01:50:27.751 --> 01:50:32.274]  And where do you think this all goes now that you've graduated to white supremacist, according to Bernie Sanders?
[01:50:33.621 --> 01:50:40.924]  I feel like my work is always going so viral because they don't know how to handle a college-educated woman.
[01:50:40.964 --> 01:50:43.806]  By the way, this is Caitlyn Bennett and I was mumbling words.
[01:50:44.026 --> 01:50:44.806]  And Millie Weaver.
[01:50:44.946 --> 01:50:45.206]  Go ahead.
[01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:55.611]  Yeah, I feel like they just don't know how to handle a young woman who just got out of college that isn't conforming to modern feminism, like you said.
[01:50:56.499 --> 01:51:05.035]  Conforming to the Democratic Party, I caused so much ruckus just from my speech and just from my activism being simple.
[01:51:05.275 --> 01:51:05.395]  It's...
[01:51:05.862 --> 01:51:06.902]  It's flat out and simple.
[01:51:06.962 --> 01:51:07.543]  It's truth.
[01:51:07.823 --> 01:51:08.603]  They don't like it.
[01:51:08.663 --> 01:51:19.447]  So when they come out and they have someone who doesn't represent feminism because I don't have armpit hair flowing out of my tank top and my hair isn't half shaved and I don't have piercings all over my face.
[01:51:19.867 --> 01:51:21.187]  So I don't look like them.
[01:51:21.207 --> 01:51:28.350]  I always feel like they're mad because I don't look like them because I don't, you know, tattoo my face and shave off my hair.
[01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:29.490]  So one, they're mad because
[01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:30.910]  I'm not ugly like them.
[01:51:31.330 --> 01:51:35.811]  And two, they're mad because they don't conform and represent what they want me to represent.
[01:51:36.271 --> 01:51:38.472]  And of course, people love to hate on that.
[01:51:38.572 --> 01:51:44.713]  So they have to kind of push you down when they can't rise to your level and they can't be better than you.
[01:51:44.753 --> 01:51:48.073]  So they have to make sure I'm brought down, but I never am.
[01:51:48.113 --> 01:51:57.275]  What they don't understand is the more they attack me, the more people go to my page, the more people follow me, the more people I'm reaching, the more people I'm influencing.
[01:51:57.535 --> 01:51:58.295]  So they're doing me
[01:51:58.895 --> 01:51:59.995]  The biggest favor.
[01:52:00.475 --> 01:52:09.098]  And, you know, I think I've been called a white supremacist for probably two years now, even before I became the Kent State gun girl.
[01:52:09.478 --> 01:52:11.278]  And, you know, at first it really bothered me.
[01:52:11.298 --> 01:52:13.539]  But this is kind of a message to the listeners.
[01:52:13.919 --> 01:52:20.321]  You have to understand that you know that you aren't any of these labels that the left is going to throw at you.
[01:52:20.741 --> 01:52:25.502]  So reject them a couple of times, but don't spend too much time worrying about it.
[01:52:26.209 --> 01:52:29.291]  Because they want to distract you from the truth of what's really happening.
[01:52:29.611 --> 01:52:32.653]  You want to talk about open borders and what's going on there.
[01:52:32.673 --> 01:52:36.936]  You want to talk about Islam and the dangers that are going on there with that religion.
[01:52:37.437 --> 01:52:39.098]  But they're going to call you white supremacists.
[01:52:39.518 --> 01:52:40.939]  Don't even touch on the subject.
[01:52:40.959 --> 01:52:41.760]  Say, no, I'm not.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.161]  Let's talk about the truth.
[01:52:43.201 --> 01:52:44.802]  Let's talk about what's actually going on.
[01:52:44.842 --> 01:52:53.127]  It's a way to distract people in the population from talking about the truth and the dangers of certain ideologies and certain policies.
[01:52:53.347 --> 01:52:55.269]  Don't fall into that trap.
[01:52:57.745 --> 01:52:59.866]  Caitlin, I totally agree with you.
[01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:02.387]  And our listeners should realize we're at the tip of the spear.
[01:53:02.427 --> 01:53:03.167]  We're fighting hard.
[01:53:03.187 --> 01:53:13.552]  And I really appreciate you and Millie Weaver and just the dynamic work you're doing that's made so many other conservatives and libertarians and nationalists jealous.
[01:53:14.292 --> 01:53:22.155]  And I'm just glad that you guys in the last year with your great success have not let that get to you and that you didn't wait in line, as you said.
[01:53:23.116 --> 01:53:25.677]  And now you're getting more views than Ben Shapiro.
[01:53:26.537 --> 01:53:27.658]  The establishment's pushing.
[01:53:27.738 --> 01:53:30.239]  You're not being pushed by the establishment, but the people like you.
[01:53:30.719 --> 01:53:31.740]  They like what they see.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:35.902]  Just a common sense, you know, Midwestern young lady taking action.
[01:53:35.922 --> 01:53:37.343]  And we just salute the work you're doing.
[01:53:37.363 --> 01:53:40.625]  And I want to be able to put a couple more camera people with you and your team.
[01:53:40.645 --> 01:53:43.966]  I want to be able to fly you guys more places with a bigger budget.
[01:53:44.007 --> 01:53:45.167]  So I want to encourage all listeners.

[01:54:04.329 --> 01:54:06.310]  That have been on the fence that just take this show for granted.
[01:54:06.410 --> 01:54:07.110]  Don't do it.
[01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:09.171]  DNA Force is selling out.
[01:54:09.231 --> 01:54:10.291]  Find out why it's so amazing.
[01:54:10.351 --> 01:54:10.972]  It's discounted.
[01:54:11.612 --> 01:54:20.035]  We've got the lowest price ever on a two-week emergency food supply in an amazing, totable, hard plastic, rubber container.
[01:54:20.716 --> 01:54:22.256]  Each meal vacuum sealed.
[01:54:22.276 --> 01:54:23.116]  It's super high quality.
[01:54:23.477 --> 01:54:24.117]  It's all there.
[01:54:25.956 --> 01:54:28.357]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:54:29.378 --> 01:54:37.521]  Now I've got some really big scientific news I'm going to get to next hour with Dr. Nick Baggage that I've been saving up for when he was going to be in studio with us today.
[01:54:38.602 --> 01:54:40.162]  But just briefly, I wanted to hit this with you.
[01:54:40.823 --> 01:54:43.804]  Not that I'm that smart, but I've just figured out the ins and outs of this.
[01:54:44.404 --> 01:54:49.667]  The Mueller report is the culmination of an attempt to have a coup against the president that failed.
[01:54:50.007 --> 01:54:52.848]  So it was a fraud, they caught him, so they had to pull it back.
[01:54:52.988 --> 01:54:54.749]  They could never make anything up because there was nothing there.
[01:54:56.072 --> 01:55:04.096]  So obviously the report is going to then be an attempt to cover up of the illegal investigation, the illegal FISA warrants, and all the perjury to Congress.
[01:55:04.116 --> 01:55:07.978]  So I said two weeks ago and a week ago, I said you Democrats better watch it.
[01:55:08.578 --> 01:55:20.925]  You want the full 400 page report put out, all the thousands of pages of index, files that go with it, it's going to be a blueprint of your illegal spying and lying to Congress.
[01:55:21.909 --> 01:55:27.151]  Well, now they're basically going to release it except for a few redactions of agents and people.
[01:55:28.651 --> 01:55:30.152]  Here's NBCNews.com.
[01:55:31.452 --> 01:55:38.955]  So next week's news today, InfoWars.com, I told you this, White House officials concerned about being exposed by report.
[01:55:40.319 --> 01:55:45.725]  And it's not just Trump officials that blew the whistle and spied on Trump and tried to have 25th Amendment coups.
[01:55:46.145 --> 01:55:49.088]  It's people going all the way back to Obama.
[01:55:49.448 --> 01:55:52.251]  This is all a serious situation.
[01:55:53.192 --> 01:55:56.455]  It's supposedly coming out in about 38 hours from now.
[01:55:57.256 --> 01:55:59.038]  What do you expect to be in here, Caitlin?
[01:56:00.185 --> 01:56:03.406]  Well, I expect that the Democrats are going to be really upset.
[01:56:03.426 --> 01:56:07.348]  I think it's going to show that, you know, there wasn't any collusion with Russia.
[01:56:07.428 --> 01:56:13.711]  We know that there hasn't been, even though all these claims of evidence and, you know, it's crazy.
[01:56:13.751 --> 01:56:18.493]  So I think more so, that's going to be more important than Trump and Russia.
[01:56:19.293 --> 01:56:30.137]  Are the Democrats and they're spying on Trump in the campaign and perhaps their collusion with other foreign nations as well to try to unseat Trump, to try to rig the election.
[01:56:30.557 --> 01:56:32.297]  So I think they're going to be disappointed.
[01:56:32.397 --> 01:56:33.438]  I think they're scared.
[01:56:33.578 --> 01:56:40.780]  And when Attorney General Barr used the word spying, it got them all kind of wrestling in their seats because they they're scared.
[01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.621]  It's finally going to come out what the truth is.
[01:56:45.555 --> 01:56:46.536]  You're absolutely right.
[01:56:46.596 --> 01:56:53.500]  Well, Caitlin, I know you don't want to tell people what you're doing next, but you and, of course, Millie Weaver and others are on fire.
[01:56:54.081 --> 01:56:56.122]  That term gets overused, but you are in fuego.
[01:56:56.763 --> 01:57:02.807]  So we'll all just be watching what you do on a routine basis at NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:57:02.927 --> 01:57:06.289]  And then on your own site, tell people about that, the Liberty Hangout again.
[01:57:06.309 --> 01:57:08.451]  Yeah, it's LibertyHangout.org.
[01:57:08.511 --> 01:57:14.515]  It's just a website and we kind of post articles and every video will be in an article there.
[01:57:16.067 --> 01:57:17.168]  It's not just the website.
[01:57:17.228 --> 01:57:25.437]  It's a badass place where a young lady and her fiancé and others are taking action, swinging for the fences and knocking home runs and grand slams.
[01:57:25.978 --> 01:57:28.400]  So as they try to censor the web, folks, back to websites.
[01:57:28.801 --> 01:57:31.383]  NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, that local radio station.
[01:57:31.764 --> 01:57:32.925]  Tell people how you're listening.
[01:57:33.265 --> 01:57:34.086]  Support the station.
[01:57:34.106 --> 01:57:34.927]  Caitlin, we salute you.
[01:57:34.967 --> 01:57:35.368]  Great job.
[01:57:36.055 --> 01:57:36.455]  Thank you.
[01:57:37.216 --> 01:57:39.257]  Can't wait to see what she does next.
[01:57:39.897 --> 01:57:43.720]  All right, coming in next, Dr. Nick Baggage in studio.
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:46.061]  How will the empire strike back?
[01:57:46.101 --> 01:57:47.742]  We'll get his intel straight ahead.
[01:57:48.003 --> 01:57:48.443]  Stay with us.
[01:57:54.123 --> 01:57:56.365]  This is CNN Breaking News.
[01:57:56.646 --> 01:58:05.796]  We've got breaking news for you, and I have to tell you, the pictures are shocking from London today, where Julian Assange's long standoff with international authorities is finally over.
[01:58:05.876 --> 01:58:09.119]  Assange has made a name for himself, leaking government secrets.
[01:58:09.179 --> 01:58:14.084]  He harms our diplomatic interests, and he sprinkles when he tinkles.
[01:58:16.078 --> 01:58:18.059]  Also known as a bad case of the Wikileaks.
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:18.840]  Wikileaks.
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:19.621]  Wikileaks.
[01:58:19.681 --> 01:58:20.281]  Wikileaks.
[01:58:20.481 --> 01:58:21.001]  Wikileaks.
[01:58:21.182 --> 01:58:21.682]  Wikileaks.
[01:58:21.882 --> 01:58:22.382]  Wikileaks.
[01:58:22.543 --> 01:58:23.323]  Wikileaks.
[01:58:23.403 --> 01:58:24.244]  I love Wikileaks.
[01:58:24.264 --> 01:58:24.764]  Wikileaks.
[01:58:28.228 --> 01:58:28.708]  I can't hear.
[01:58:28.728 --> 01:58:29.269]  WikiLeaks.
[01:58:29.409 --> 01:58:31.230]  Oh, Wiki... Wiki... What?
[01:58:31.730 --> 01:58:32.370]  WikiLeaks.
[01:58:32.530 --> 01:58:34.211]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
[01:58:34.251 --> 01:58:35.152]  Julian Assange.
[01:58:35.212 --> 01:58:36.072]  Julian Assange.
[01:58:36.112 --> 01:58:36.913]  Julian Assange.
[01:58:36.953 --> 01:58:37.793]  Julian Assange.
[01:58:37.833 --> 01:58:38.633]  Julian Assange.
[01:58:38.653 --> 01:58:39.394]  Julian Assange.
[01:58:39.494 --> 01:58:40.414]  Julian Assange.
[01:58:40.494 --> 01:58:41.575]  Julian Assange.
[01:58:41.635 --> 01:58:43.136]  Julian Assange is a hero.
[01:58:43.196 --> 01:58:46.998]  Julian Assange, the head of WikiLeaks and Draco Malfoy's biological father.
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:49.742]  Has finally been arrested.
[01:58:49.762 --> 01:58:53.946]  He was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy looking like Santa Claus with a manifesto.
[01:58:53.986 --> 01:58:57.049]  The guy went in looking like Draco Malfoy, came out looking like Dumbledore.
[01:58:57.069 --> 01:58:58.511]  He was a cyber terrorist.
[01:58:58.551 --> 01:59:01.233]  I think what he did was despicable and dangerous.
[01:59:01.273 --> 01:59:07.099]  He hacked into the Democrats' computers and helped Trump get elected.
[01:59:07.139 --> 01:59:10.203]  He has an answer for what he has done.
[01:59:11.124 --> 01:59:23.040]  Well, if you watched a lot of the coverage of this story today on television, you likely came away with the understanding that Julian Assange is some kind of Russian spy who's in trouble tonight because he stole classified documents from the U.S.
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:23.441]  government.
[01:59:23.581 --> 01:59:25.363]  I know for sure it is the Russians.
[01:59:25.544 --> 01:59:26.244]  That is not true.
[01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:27.346]  It's factually incorrect.
[01:59:27.386 --> 01:59:27.806]  Correct.
[01:59:27.846 --> 01:59:34.010]  The claim that Russia hacked into the DNC and got data and gave it to WikiLeaks has been a fraud from the very beginning.
[01:59:34.090 --> 01:59:39.433]  The unsolved murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich continues to get a huge amount of attention.
[01:59:39.473 --> 01:59:46.597]  Murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich shared 44,053 Democrat emails with WikiLeaks.
[01:59:46.637 --> 01:59:53.741]  We have this very strange story now of this young man who worked for the Democratic National Committee who apparently was assassinated.
[01:59:55.447 --> 02:00:01.390]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.892 --> 02:00:06.993]  We're not going to make America great again.
[02:00:07.013 --> 02:00:09.075]  It was never that great.
[02:00:12.777 --> 02:00:15.658]  We have not reached greatness.
[02:00:16.279 --> 02:00:18.620]  What's wrong with this picture right here?
[02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:20.650]  You're a radio listener.
[02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:22.831]  Stories posted up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:22.851 --> 02:00:24.631]  It's from the LA Times.
[02:00:25.212 --> 02:00:30.493]  Putting American flags on police cars sparks backlash in Laguna Beach.
[02:00:30.533 --> 02:00:33.514]  Yes, people don't like seeing American flags.
[02:00:33.994 --> 02:00:37.215]  And the reason they've got to be brought out is they're demonizing the American flag.
[02:00:37.615 --> 02:00:41.456]  The Democratic Party has officially come out and said, many of their leaders, get rid of it.
[02:00:41.916 --> 02:00:43.457]  It's a racist, evil symbol.
[02:00:43.777 --> 02:00:49.638]  The Beach City Council will decide this week if a flag graphic on the side of its patrol cars will stay or go.
[02:00:49.658 --> 02:00:55.680]  In February, the council agreed to paint the cars, but the design ended up being brighter and bolder than the proposed one.
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:02.521]  Some residents feel the flag is a little too aggressive, while others are surprised anyone would object to the American flag.
[02:01:03.121 --> 02:01:06.822]  This week, the council will vote to keep the design or choose an alternative.
[02:01:07.142 --> 02:01:11.023]  This was all over YouTube and all over the place on Facebook yesterday.
[02:01:11.063 --> 02:01:12.163]  It's been taken down.
[02:01:13.868 --> 02:01:17.650]  We have a low-res copy of it, but this is already about to air.
[02:01:18.330 --> 02:01:20.051]  This is airing on CBS television.
[02:01:20.831 --> 02:01:25.153]  Anti-Trump show faces backlash for inciting violence against conservatives.
[02:01:25.234 --> 02:01:29.656]  Says any Trump supporter is a Nazi and should be physically attacked.
[02:01:29.716 --> 02:01:31.597]  That's how the Democrats operate.
[02:01:31.637 --> 02:01:34.398]  Jamie White wrote a story about it for InfoWars.com.
[02:01:34.478 --> 02:01:36.619]  Is it alright to hit a Nazi unprovoked?
[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:40.121]  I was always taught to never throw the first punch.
[02:01:40.281 --> 02:01:41.261]  Never instigate.
[02:01:41.301 --> 02:01:42.242]  The fans don't attack.
[02:01:43.268 --> 02:02:00.885]  But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face during an interview and I realized that Spencer was in a pressed suit, wearing a tie, being interviewed like his opinion mattered, like he should be considered part of the conversation, like neo-Nazism was just one political point of view.
[02:02:01.185 --> 02:02:06.230]  And then I realized there's no better way to show some speech is not equal.
[02:02:07.014 --> 02:02:09.675]  Some speech requires a more visceral response.
[02:02:09.915 --> 02:02:11.155]  It's like Overton's window.
[02:02:11.175 --> 02:02:14.577]  That's the term from which ideas are tolerated in public discourse.
[02:02:14.697 --> 02:02:19.338]  Well, Overton's window doesn't mean **** unless it comes with some enforcement, so yeah!
[02:02:20.098 --> 02:02:21.179]  This is enforcement.
[02:02:22.179 --> 02:02:23.960]  It's time to punch a few Nazis.
[02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:27.461]  Remember when Tucker Carlson last year...
[02:02:29.059 --> 02:02:40.110]  ...was defending Rand Paul, who Senator John McCain had called a Russian agent on the floor, because he voted against bombing Russian troops in Syria, who were pushing ISIS and Al-Qaeda and al-Nusra out.
[02:02:41.471 --> 02:02:45.976]  Swallowswell told... Senator Carroll said, well, you work for Putin too.
[02:02:48.138 --> 02:02:50.320]  Quote, you work for Putin too.
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:52.663]  What an outrageous statement.
[02:02:53.618 --> 02:02:55.179]  What an incredible statement.
[02:02:55.820 --> 02:03:05.927]  When Swallow's Well is connected to the Democrats that hate America, say they want to get rid of the country, they hate American flags, they hate the Bill of Rights, they hate the military, they hate police, they say the country sucks!
[02:03:06.628 --> 02:03:10.351]  My God, all the Democrats are electing is a bunch of crazy Muslim women.
[02:03:10.771 --> 02:03:15.094]  They want to cut their daughters' genitals off and say that 9-11 people, you know, did something.
[02:03:15.735 --> 02:03:16.495]  It's insane!
[02:03:17.496 --> 02:03:24.838]  CARE was founded after 9-11 because they recognized that some people did something.
[02:03:27.459 --> 02:03:28.940]  So you have no idea right now?
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:29.780]  Oh, there's another one.
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:31.320]  Another plane just hit.
[02:03:32.021 --> 02:03:43.784]  Last night, if you were unfortunate enough to be on tour and saw the President's tweet about a member of Congress, Ilhan Omar, from Minnesota,
[02:03:46.095 --> 02:03:51.178]  ...happens to be a Muslim member of Congress, and that is important.
[02:03:51.838 --> 02:04:09.988]  Because the President tweeted a video that shows Representative Omar speaking, and in that speech is intersplaced with planes hitting the Twin Towers on 9-11, and the end of the video says, we will never forget.
[02:04:14.250 --> 02:04:15.391]  This is an incitement
[02:04:21.546 --> 02:04:24.610]  Here's what Omar recently told Vogue Arabia in an interview.
[02:04:24.670 --> 02:04:28.634]  She described living in the United States as, quote, an everyday assault.
[02:04:29.375 --> 02:04:36.122]  America is so racist and hateful, she says, that she feels, quote, threatened, demonized, and vilified every day.
[02:04:36.763 --> 02:04:38.484]  It's difficult for her even to go to work.
[02:04:39.125 --> 02:04:42.946]  In many ways, things were easier growing up in a refugee camp in Kenya, she says.
[02:04:43.387 --> 02:04:49.669]  Quote, when you're a kid and you're raised in an all-black, all-Muslim environment, nobody really talks to you about your identity.
[02:04:49.689 --> 02:04:50.369]  You just are.
[02:04:50.929 --> 02:04:53.150]  There is freedom in knowing that you are accepted.
[02:04:53.170 --> 02:04:54.631]  Yeah, so why'd you come here?
[02:04:55.351 --> 02:04:56.091]  To conquer us?
[02:04:57.051 --> 02:04:57.392]  That's it.
[02:04:57.532 --> 02:04:58.332]  She doesn't want to assimilate.
[02:04:58.912 --> 02:05:01.153]  She's been brought here by Soros to piss all over everything.
[02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:08.432]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:08.652 --> 02:05:16.194]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:17.215 --> 02:05:19.796]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:20.196 --> 02:05:21.556]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:21.936 --> 02:05:28.218]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:05:30.299 --> 02:05:35.202]  The Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[02:05:35.642 --> 02:05:38.544]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:38.584 --> 02:05:42.206]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:42.526 --> 02:05:46.088]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:46.488 --> 02:05:48.189]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:48.329 --> 02:05:53.932]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:54.412 --> 02:05:55.273]  Don't live
[02:05:56.093 --> 02:05:59.818]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[02:06:00.159 --> 02:06:01.420]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:06:14.964 --> 02:06:19.026]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:06:19.807 --> 02:06:21.227]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:06:21.487 --> 02:06:22.648]  Well, so does he.
[02:06:23.168 --> 02:06:27.891]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:30.172 --> 02:06:32.953]  All right, Dr. Nick Baggett joins us, and he's a smart cookie.
[02:06:33.854 --> 02:06:37.536]  As you know, he co-hosts quite often, but he's here in studio with us.
[02:06:37.576 --> 02:06:39.397]  His dad was a famous congressman that actually got
[02:06:40.590 --> 02:06:43.013]  The land signed over to the people in Alaska.
[02:06:43.093 --> 02:06:45.375]  Actual good land use system compared to all the others.
[02:06:45.975 --> 02:06:47.016]  His brother, of course, was a U.S.
[02:06:47.057 --> 02:06:56.326]  Senator, but he is a guy I've been around for over 26, 27 years as a scientist and as a professor exposing with books and films.
[02:06:57.554 --> 02:06:58.195]  We're good to go.
[02:07:14.534 --> 02:07:17.637]  Admits geoengineering about a three minute clip.
[02:07:18.058 --> 02:07:32.072]  It's on YouTube and I even put a encyclopedia Britannica up saying there is no weather modification Because the official story is there isn't but when they have the CIA telling the CFR there is They fact-check and say he's wrong That's right.
[02:07:32.212 --> 02:07:33.773]  That's next-level mind control.
[02:07:33.973 --> 02:07:35.195]  So we're gonna play that clip
[02:07:36.331 --> 02:07:52.961]  Coming up as well, but you were talking during the break about Sanders and Ilhan Omar and AOC and we've got, it's up on Infowars.com, we've got the usual suspect coming out saying, shut up Pelosi, Michael Moore says, we are socialists, we're going to be socialist.
[02:07:53.542 --> 02:07:55.443]  But that isn't the socialism the average person thinks.
[02:07:55.483 --> 02:07:57.284]  So you're a smart political hand.
[02:07:57.504 --> 02:07:59.325]  You grew up knee high to a grasshopper in this.
[02:07:59.766 --> 02:08:01.387]  You're a guy that sees kind of over the horizon.
[02:08:01.827 --> 02:08:03.368]  What would you call this period?
[02:08:03.488 --> 02:08:04.529]  What the globalists are doing?
[02:08:06.201 --> 02:08:06.902]  At this current point?
[02:08:07.182 --> 02:08:15.091]  You know, from my perspective, it's really consolidation of power and splitting those that are really threatening.
[02:08:15.131 --> 02:08:20.637]  And when you think about what's going on on the right, you know, we're dealing with facts and information.
[02:08:20.677 --> 02:08:22.179]  On the left, they're dealing with emotions.
[02:08:22.799 --> 02:08:24.181]  And that's what they're manipulating.
[02:08:24.281 --> 02:08:37.831]  And when you think about within the Democratic Party, the split that's emerging, which is a split between socialists, communists, and those that were basically the old labor, working people kind of folks.
[02:08:38.011 --> 02:08:47.018]  And then you've got sort of scattered throughout the Democratic Party is all of the flaky kind of weird subgroups.
[02:08:47.278 --> 02:08:48.259]  You know, they've really missed it.
[02:08:48.299 --> 02:08:51.201]  And this is where the parties of both parties actually have left the
[02:08:51.701 --> 02:08:52.362]  Left the base.
[02:08:52.402 --> 02:08:56.766]  And that's why the Republicans with all the establishment candidates couldn't get any of them elected.
[02:08:56.826 --> 02:08:57.446]  Trump came out.
[02:08:57.846 --> 02:09:01.890]  And he completely changed the platform really for the Republican Party.
[02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:03.631]  You see the same things happening with the Democrats.
[02:09:03.952 --> 02:09:08.416]  What people were looking for two years ago was real change.
[02:09:08.736 --> 02:09:10.878]  Whether you're on the left or the right, people were sick.
[02:09:11.338 --> 02:09:12.119]  Of the status quo.
[02:09:12.139 --> 02:09:24.447]  So what I see more of is sort of this consolidation of consolidating power in the hands of really corporate interests that are using both parties to further their political aims.
[02:09:25.469 --> 02:09:32.212]  And we'll talk about that at the bottom of the hour, because whether Trump knows this or not, remember Obama tried to sign the internet over to the UN, the EU.
[02:09:32.632 --> 02:09:33.393]  It happened partially.
[02:09:33.433 --> 02:09:34.733]  Well, they're just going ahead with that plan.
[02:09:35.253 --> 02:09:39.735]  Just like Trump got elected, but Hillary and the stay-behind networks with Obama just continued their plan.
[02:09:40.236 --> 02:09:48.559]  And so, I don't know if Trump's ignorant or not, but they're coming in, and oh, Zuckerberg's embracing censorship with the EU, and oh, we're getting rid of Section 230.
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:54.242]  Yes, they're ending the free web, as we know, for corporate consolidation, and the Wall Street Journal hails it.
[02:09:54.602 --> 02:09:54.822]  Right.
[02:09:54.942 --> 02:10:02.428]  And you know, the idea of the Internet being, you know, originally a place to really the town square of the modern 21st century.
[02:10:02.448 --> 02:10:02.928]  That's what it was.
[02:10:03.128 --> 02:10:05.390]  That's what was becoming the town square.
[02:10:06.210 --> 02:10:09.793]  And now it's shifted again back to really it has never been that.
[02:10:09.933 --> 02:10:16.497]  From the globalist perspective, it was the biggest propaganda machine and data collection network in history.
[02:10:16.598 --> 02:10:20.140]  So what happens now is people freely give up their information.
[02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:24.043]  They allow for the profiling that is used both commercially and politically.
[02:10:25.104 --> 02:10:31.191]  The same things that were developed in China, and we've talked about this before for social scoring, is the same things that Google did and others have done.
[02:10:31.211 --> 02:10:33.053]  So it's a paradox.
[02:10:33.093 --> 02:10:35.876]  They always believed, oh, let them have websites, they won't defeat us.
[02:10:36.357 --> 02:10:42.804]  We start defeating them, it makes them accelerate phase two of the web, not as a freeing system, but something of total control.
[02:10:43.004 --> 02:10:43.764]  That's exactly it.
[02:10:43.824 --> 02:10:52.268]  And when you think about how people gather knowledge now, you know, we used to get sort of both sides of the story, or at least that was the attempt in the news media.
[02:10:52.388 --> 02:10:52.909]  Now we don't.
[02:10:52.949 --> 02:10:55.290]  We get the editorial news, which is the way it is.
[02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:57.451]  And I think on that basis,
[02:10:58.311 --> 02:11:04.736]  We need to function a little bit more like contrarians because we need to know what the adversary is saying and thinking so we can better prepare our arguments.
[02:11:05.176 --> 02:11:12.602]  So I think we have to make a more active approach to gain the knowledge of who you're opposing so you can better frame your arguments to get into the fight.
[02:11:12.902 --> 02:11:14.503]  Otherwise, we're just singing to the choir.
[02:11:14.543 --> 02:11:15.564]  We don't need to sing to the choir.
[02:11:15.584 --> 02:11:21.168]  We need to convert people into re-examining themselves and the way that we shape the world together.
[02:11:21.888 --> 02:11:22.349]  No, I agree.
[02:11:22.369 --> 02:11:23.730]  You know, it's quite a train wreck.
[02:11:24.904 --> 02:11:31.391]  That people question Notre Dame because no one knew if it was arson or Islamic or electrical fire or construction fire.
[02:11:31.691 --> 02:11:36.356]  And they said, we haven't been inside, we don't know what did it, but it's not terror and it's not arson.
[02:11:36.796 --> 02:11:38.198]  Well, everybody knows about a fire investigation.
[02:11:38.218 --> 02:11:38.959]  You can't say that.
[02:11:39.019 --> 02:11:40.881]  So it makes people suspicious.
[02:11:41.341 --> 02:11:43.784]  And so CNN, Fox, they start banning guests.
[02:11:44.324 --> 02:11:48.730]  Federal officers in France, heads of the Catholic organizations.
[02:11:49.191 --> 02:11:50.353]  No, you don't question.
[02:11:50.973 --> 02:11:51.995]  Muslims weren't involved.
[02:11:52.035 --> 02:11:53.737]  Well, you don't know who was involved.
[02:11:54.278 --> 02:11:58.584]  And Al-Qaeda and ISIS said they were going to target this cathedral, and they've done it before.
[02:11:59.125 --> 02:12:00.326]  So it's that mere fact.
[02:12:01.588 --> 02:12:11.036]  YouTube and Google started putting messages under articles or videos, superimposed, saying, people think 9-11 was staged, but it wasn't, and this wasn't staged either.
[02:12:11.477 --> 02:12:20.425]  So before the fires are even out, they were superimposing stuff under it, saying, no, this was a fire from construction, move along.
[02:12:20.805 --> 02:12:21.986]  Wow.
[02:12:22.006 --> 02:12:24.888]  And the fact that these things have been talked about.
[02:12:26.107 --> 02:12:27.368]  But of course it backfired.
[02:12:27.428 --> 02:12:28.588]  People are pissed now.
[02:12:28.608 --> 02:12:30.509]  They're like, what are you covering up?
[02:12:30.549 --> 02:12:35.352]  Right, because the smoke hasn't even cleared the room yet.
[02:12:35.932 --> 02:12:41.815]  You know, and the fact is on every major fire, especially something of this magnitude, is going to require, you know, in the U.S.
[02:12:41.895 --> 02:12:45.757]  it would have been the fire marshals coming in, doing all of the forensics.
[02:12:45.958 --> 02:12:48.579]  Yeah, and it would have taken months to get an answer.
[02:12:49.539 --> 02:12:51.761]  The flames are shooting up 400 feet in the air.
[02:12:52.461 --> 02:12:56.682]  And they're saying, we don't know what did it, but it's not Islamic or it's not arson.
[02:12:57.502 --> 02:12:57.782]  Right.
[02:12:58.042 --> 02:13:00.303]  And you know, here's my take on it.
[02:13:00.743 --> 02:13:05.904]  Christianity has been under attack in every quarter of the world in various ways.
[02:13:06.384 --> 02:13:14.266]  The idea of burning, bombing, affecting churches, attacking Christianity, attacking the core value system of the West.
[02:13:14.566 --> 02:13:18.707]  Because whether you're a Christian or not, the value system is the West.
[02:13:19.827 --> 02:13:20.988]  Classic, real Christianity.
[02:13:21.028 --> 02:13:23.589]  Not the fake one, but it's what built this.
[02:13:23.769 --> 02:13:24.869]  That's exactly right.
[02:13:24.889 --> 02:13:26.930]  And you can go back to the Founding Fathers.
[02:13:26.991 --> 02:13:27.971]  Many of them were deists.
[02:13:28.011 --> 02:13:28.811]  They weren't Christians.
[02:13:28.831 --> 02:13:29.612]  They were something else.
[02:13:31.733 --> 02:13:35.775]  Some don't even remember this, but there's a Bible called the Jefferson Bible.
[02:13:36.595 --> 02:13:37.696]  And people forget about this.
[02:13:38.076 --> 02:13:40.077]  He never talked about his religion.
[02:13:40.517 --> 02:13:41.878]  That was one of the things he didn't do.
[02:13:42.258 --> 02:13:43.058]  But he kept this.
[02:13:43.098 --> 02:13:46.160]  And what it was, was all the highlighted parts that Christ said.
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:47.981]  That's what he kept as his bio.
[02:13:48.121 --> 02:13:50.762]  He didn't want interpretation, he wanted information.
[02:13:51.422 --> 02:14:00.207]  But when you think about how that got applied into the basic form of government that we have, those value systems, this is the core of the West.
[02:14:00.367 --> 02:14:03.969]  And this is what's being gutted right now that we're really not seeing.
[02:14:03.989 --> 02:14:12.393]  Because that was based not on a big collective, the Bernie Sanders vision of the future, this was based on strong individuals.
[02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:30.147]  The sovereignty of the individual soul, the created human being that each of us are, and the idea, the respect, whether they were Christians or Deists of our founding fathers, was the recognition of human beings as... Made in the image of God.
[02:14:30.287 --> 02:14:31.909]  Made in the image and likeness of God.
[02:14:31.929 --> 02:14:32.770]  What about the paradox?
[02:14:32.810 --> 02:14:34.691]  Because, I mean, absolutely, that...
[02:14:37.518 --> 02:14:48.650]  We are individuals, but then individuals, when they're left to be individuals, generally then go with whatever the best system is, and it creates a collective, but it's not a top-down collective, it's an individually created collective.
[02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:55.037]  Yeah, I would say it's the analogy of cells in the human body functioning independently, but interdependent on everyone.
[02:14:55.703 --> 02:14:56.544]  You know, it's that.
[02:14:56.624 --> 02:15:00.026]  In fact, the model was even used as, you know, you're a part of the body, right?
[02:15:00.166 --> 02:15:01.447]  I mean, and so that's it.
[02:15:01.487 --> 02:15:04.049]  So it's synchronized, but it's coming from the individual level.
[02:15:04.189 --> 02:15:05.110]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:15:05.170 --> 02:15:10.013]  And I think because, you know, what do I think about that statement, creating the image and likeness?
[02:15:10.173 --> 02:15:14.256]  You know, and that's both whether you're Christian, Jewish, or Muslim, right?
[02:15:14.276 --> 02:15:15.737]  Those are the basic premise.
[02:15:15.898 --> 02:15:19.120]  And so how do we project that if we're going to project that honestly?
[02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:20.861]  By the way, that was written thousands of years ago.
[02:15:20.881 --> 02:15:22.562]  We'd already built pyramids and you name it.
[02:15:22.582 --> 02:15:23.343]  Look what we've done now.
[02:15:23.363 --> 02:15:24.544]  I mean, we are pretty powerful.
[02:15:24.944 --> 02:15:25.284]  Oh yeah.
[02:15:25.604 --> 02:15:28.166]  And this is why it's even more important to be responsible.
[02:15:28.566 --> 02:15:37.650]  And I think the responsibility is to take the ideas, debate those ideas, develop those ideas, and engage the public in an awakening.
[02:15:37.670 --> 02:15:38.851]  And that's what I see happening.
[02:15:38.891 --> 02:15:41.732]  We are awakening to the power of the individual human being.
[02:15:41.732 --> 02:15:47.896]  You keep saying that's what the globalists are trying to suppress with the chemicals, the biologicals, the radiologicals, the electromagnetic.
[02:15:48.316 --> 02:15:51.919]  They fear what humanity already is and is about to realize.
[02:15:52.239 --> 02:15:53.980]  We're not about to become that in my view.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:54.721]  We're already it.
[02:15:55.021 --> 02:15:55.821]  We just don't know it.
[02:15:55.941 --> 02:15:57.022]  We just got to remember again.
[02:15:57.402 --> 02:15:58.563]  We'll be right back with Dr. Nick Becker.
[02:15:58.583 --> 02:15:59.003]  Stay with us.
[02:16:04.207 --> 02:16:08.370]  I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain
[02:16:09.670 --> 02:16:13.435]  Where I'm coming from that parallels current, real-time reality.
[02:16:13.876 --> 02:16:16.339]  So please, bear with me a few minutes.
[02:16:17.781 --> 02:16:20.705]  Because this is just bubbling up in my own thought processes.
[02:16:21.927 --> 02:16:23.449]  Of why am I sitting here with my shirt off?
[02:16:24.210 --> 02:16:24.731]  I'll explain.
[02:16:26.331 --> 02:16:30.534]  Our listeners, our viewers, are what Infowars really is.
[02:16:31.234 --> 02:16:38.278]  A populist, free market, pro-human movement that has detonated awakenings and resistance all over the world.
[02:16:39.119 --> 02:16:42.161]  We are the big giant tsunami coming in against globalist tyranny.
[02:16:42.981 --> 02:16:46.443]  You really are kicking globalist ass on every level.
[02:16:47.064 --> 02:16:47.544]  They're paying it.
[02:16:48.505 --> 02:16:50.346]  They thought that they had already won.
[02:16:51.987 --> 02:16:55.209]  But if they can still use corporate media to attack the leaders
[02:16:56.813 --> 02:16:58.214]  Of the resistance to globalism.
[02:16:58.535 --> 02:17:15.027]  And if they can strip us of who we really are, and then put banners on us, like a NASCAR, and claim that we support racism, or we support abusing women, or we support all these things we don't support, they can win.
[02:17:16.448 --> 02:17:25.635]  That's why it's important to strip it all away, what they've claimed, what they've said, the straw men they've built, and to tell people what you really stand for.
[02:17:26.633 --> 02:17:34.357]  But in this world of thousands and thousands of channels and millions of hosts, the truth gets drowned out sometimes.
[02:17:34.377 --> 02:17:35.958]  That's what the globals are hoping is gonna happen.
[02:17:36.498 --> 02:17:41.341]  But out of all the shows and all the broadcasts out there, it's this show particularly they fear.
[02:17:42.001 --> 02:17:47.224]  Because we don't go off the pop culture they put out, we go off what they actually say, what they actually stand for.
[02:17:48.645 --> 02:17:51.927]  Now I was thinking as 2018 ended, now four months ago,
[02:17:53.359 --> 02:17:55.340]  I was thinking, what have I dropped the ball on?
[02:17:55.921 --> 02:17:58.182]  What's one area in the info where we haven't been effective?
[02:17:58.782 --> 02:17:59.983]  Where we were effective previously?
[02:18:00.644 --> 02:18:03.746]  And that's wearing our flags openly.
[02:18:04.706 --> 02:18:05.807]  Wearing our colors openly.
[02:18:07.488 --> 02:18:10.350]  And it starts with not being ashamed of the American flag that's under attack.
[02:18:10.470 --> 02:18:12.631]  The official Democrats want to remove it.
[02:18:13.512 --> 02:18:16.194]  Want to take Thomas Jefferson off the money.
[02:18:17.256 --> 02:18:18.097]  Saying he was a racist.
[02:18:18.177 --> 02:18:20.078]  I mean, they're even assaulting the flag now.
[02:18:20.178 --> 02:18:24.781]  So, they're projecting all their lies under our great symbol and it's great history.
[02:18:26.002 --> 02:18:31.106]  So first we have to strip away the lies they've put on us like logos.
[02:18:31.846 --> 02:18:32.547]  Racist.
[02:18:33.147 --> 02:18:34.048]  Homophobe.
[02:18:34.909 --> 02:18:36.129]  Anti-female.
[02:18:37.010 --> 02:18:37.771]  Criminal.
[02:18:39.282 --> 02:18:41.685]  Hoaxer, when they're the ones that are really doing all that.
[02:18:42.305 --> 02:18:48.711]  And then we have to display to everyone what we actually stand for, what we actually believe in.
[02:18:49.212 --> 02:18:51.774]  America and the world is already in a civil war.
[02:18:52.918 --> 02:18:54.660]  Pro-humans against the globalists.
[02:18:55.121 --> 02:18:58.004]  We have to wear our colors loud and proud.
[02:18:58.505 --> 02:19:00.948]  This is the best-seller right now for last year.
[02:19:00.968 --> 02:19:03.391]  The InfoWars In Your Face.
[02:19:04.192 --> 02:19:08.417]  You know, I said to listeners, I said, hey, we've got Molon Labe or we've got other shirts.
[02:19:08.437 --> 02:19:10.119]  We just want to meet like-minded people.
[02:19:11.374 --> 02:19:16.576]  But this shirt particularly, ladies and gentlemen, will really get in their face.
[02:19:17.016 --> 02:19:21.078]  And again, you'll get way more thumbs up and high fives and shake hands and meet friends.
[02:19:21.718 --> 02:19:27.080]  But there is that 1% or so out of 100 people that see you that will say, F you, Russian Asian.
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:28.101]  F you, traitor.
[02:19:28.141 --> 02:19:29.881]  But again, those are pathetic bots.
[02:19:30.462 --> 02:19:34.963]  And they want to intimidate you to not exercise your free speech.
[02:19:35.023 --> 02:19:36.384]  So don't let them.
[02:19:36.484 --> 02:19:38.265]  Don't ever back down to their tyranny.
[02:19:39.045 --> 02:19:42.786]  This week only, we're running the biggest sell ever on t-shirts across the board.

[02:19:58.129 --> 02:20:01.830]  Loud, pro-America, pro-freedom, and in the bullies' faces.
[02:20:06.394 --> 02:20:09.175]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.679 --> 02:20:20.521]  Yeah, here's our new single record from Highwayman 2 album.
[02:20:20.541 --> 02:20:21.761]  Silver Stallion.
[02:20:22.041 --> 02:20:22.862]  Silver Stallion.
[02:20:34.942 --> 02:20:36.904]  We're back live.
[02:20:36.964 --> 02:20:37.685]  Alex Jones here.
[02:20:37.745 --> 02:20:38.946]  Infowars.com.
[02:20:39.006 --> 02:20:39.867]  Newswars.com.
[02:20:39.927 --> 02:20:41.469]  Our Nick Magich is our guest.
[02:20:41.909 --> 02:20:43.791]  You can find out his great site at earthpulse.com.
[02:20:43.811 --> 02:20:46.294]  Find his books and films at infowarsstore.com.
[02:20:47.595 --> 02:21:03.181]  We've got so much news to cover, so many clips, so much to get to in the time we have while you're in studio with us, but you were getting into how the whole system is about, you suck, you're going nowhere, humanity's a joke, humanity doesn't have free will, humans are bad, let's get rid of the population.
[02:21:03.201 --> 02:21:11.365]  I mean, this is really the message, and it looks to me like the establishment really, really, really wants
[02:21:12.386 --> 02:21:15.090]  To just get us to give up and roll over and die.
[02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:16.611]  A. Is that true?
[02:21:16.732 --> 02:21:17.433]  B. Why?
[02:21:17.453 --> 02:21:19.435]  From studying the globalists, what's their endgame?
[02:21:19.916 --> 02:21:20.737]  I think it is true.
[02:21:20.777 --> 02:21:25.803]  Because, you know, every major thing that's ever happened on this planet started with one or two individuals.
[02:21:26.104 --> 02:21:29.388]  Not some big huge group waiting for the majority to form up to go do something.
[02:21:29.989 --> 02:21:34.614]  Everything meaningful in the arts, politics, business, science, it doesn't matter.
[02:21:35.174 --> 02:21:36.736]  A few engage.
[02:21:37.236 --> 02:21:38.458]  It's like evolution.
[02:21:38.618 --> 02:21:41.661]  The official story of evolution isn't real, but there is this spontaneous evolution.
[02:21:41.841 --> 02:21:42.041]  Right.
[02:21:42.181 --> 02:21:48.568]  And I think a lot of what's going on right now is the real fear is the recognition of the power of an individual.
[02:21:49.068 --> 02:21:58.693]  You know, when someone fully recognizes that they can do something, this is where, if we recognize our own divinity, we start treating ourselves like we treat someone we care about, it's kind of a good idea.
[02:21:58.713 --> 02:22:02.234]  You know, it's one of Jordan Peterson's statements.
[02:22:02.254 --> 02:22:03.195]  Have respect for ourselves.
[02:22:03.315 --> 02:22:04.435]  Have respect for yourself.
[02:22:04.475 --> 02:22:05.416]  Treat yourself well.
[02:22:05.556 --> 02:22:08.797]  And then, from that, start being a little bit self-critical.
[02:22:08.877 --> 02:22:09.878]  You know, analyzing yourself.
[02:22:10.258 --> 02:22:11.839]  But not in such a horrible way.
[02:22:11.859 --> 02:22:17.402]  You know, if you're creating the image and likeness of God... I'm already doing okay, but I've got such great potential.
[02:22:17.422 --> 02:22:18.022]  What can I really do?
[02:22:18.482 --> 02:22:19.382]  That's exactly it.
[02:22:19.462 --> 02:22:30.527]  And when we start asking that question, you know, what is possible instead of what is impossible, and then start taking those steps of the possibilities for our lives, we take control of them again.
[02:22:30.987 --> 02:22:38.811]  We get out of the hive and we begin to stand up and stick out and begin to express our individuality.
[02:22:39.251 --> 02:22:40.912]  That's what we were created to do.
[02:22:41.012 --> 02:22:44.073]  You know, people talk about purpose, having a purpose in life.
[02:22:44.133 --> 02:22:45.674]  I think it's more important to have meaning.
[02:22:46.863 --> 02:22:47.483]  And there's a difference.
[02:22:48.003 --> 02:22:57.306]  Meaning is your general state of being, and you project that in everything you do, in how you treat the person waiting you at the restaurant, in terms of how you deal with the mailman.
[02:22:57.886 --> 02:23:08.529]  But when you think about meaning and you express your value systems in how you live, purpose requires a plan and a set of actions, judgments, and so that comes under meaning.
[02:23:09.329 --> 02:23:15.716]  To define meaning about our individual lives is to apply a set of values in the way we live, and that's individual.
[02:23:16.016 --> 02:23:24.606]  This is about self-reflection, analyzing the divinity within you, and not being so self-condemning of that divinity within you that you're creating a blast for me.
[02:23:25.206 --> 02:23:27.007]  Against the creation, if you think about it.
[02:23:27.367 --> 02:23:29.189]  Being self-critical to improve who you are.
[02:23:29.229 --> 02:23:30.129]  Well, that's the devil's trick.
[02:23:30.149 --> 02:23:34.692]  The devil's called the accuser because the devil knows that we have a conscience and love God and know we're sinners.
[02:23:35.032 --> 02:23:36.933]  So the devil's always, you suck, you're bad, keep it.
[02:23:36.993 --> 02:23:37.834]  It's that paradigm.
[02:23:38.194 --> 02:23:41.036]  Instead of recognizing what's good in us to trigger the chain reaction.
[02:23:41.096 --> 02:23:41.316]  Right.
[02:23:41.396 --> 02:23:43.938]  And this is how I think the Creator, how God looks at us.
[02:23:43.978 --> 02:23:45.659]  He looks at us like we look at two-year-olds.
[02:23:46.099 --> 02:23:50.241]  There's nothing that that two-year-old is going to do that you're not going to forgive.
[02:23:50.742 --> 02:23:53.463]  And that's how God, I think, sees us in the scope of the universe.
[02:23:55.114 --> 02:23:58.385]  Small little microcosms of the creation itself.
[02:23:58.867 --> 02:24:01.175]  And so, this is the training ground.
[02:24:01.846 --> 02:24:06.467]  For becoming the soul within the carrier that we are.
[02:24:06.807 --> 02:24:12.489]  Reversing the roles of ego-driven or the devil's voice, if you will.
[02:24:12.529 --> 02:24:24.573]  The ego-driven life versus the life that recognizes our base creation and then uses our ego, uses that personality as a drive, as a tool for your awareness.
[02:24:24.633 --> 02:24:25.473]  Not the other way around.
[02:24:25.573 --> 02:24:29.054]  And see, when you flip it the other way around, then you get the train wreck.
[02:24:29.594 --> 02:24:35.720]  Because then it's ego, it's the material, it's the earthy, it's that that drives you.
[02:24:36.041 --> 02:24:39.504]  Instead of that being literally like a tool in this dimension you have to use.
[02:24:39.584 --> 02:24:40.766]  Right, and that's what it is.
[02:24:40.806 --> 02:24:41.706]  We're spiritual
[02:24:42.543 --> 02:24:43.524]  We're good to go.
[02:25:05.362 --> 02:25:13.330]  You know, when they start talking about synthetic telepathy and they start talking about all of these attributes of perhaps what we're capable of, but they're doing it in a synthetic way.
[02:25:13.370 --> 02:25:15.493]  These are our natural attributes.
[02:25:15.793 --> 02:25:16.514]  Well, I mean, it's true.
[02:25:16.554 --> 02:25:20.458]  I've learned when I literally just turn loose and do what I think's right, then I do all this amazing stuff.
[02:25:20.838 --> 02:25:22.179]  But if I overthink it, then it doesn't happen.
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:22.700]  Yeah, it doesn't.
[02:25:22.760 --> 02:25:25.002]  And this, I had this long discussion yesterday with a
[02:25:26.584 --> 02:25:28.365]  Twenty-something gentlemen.
[02:25:28.465 --> 02:25:31.626]  And the value of intuition versus the value of intellect.
[02:25:31.666 --> 02:25:34.347]  And I default to intuition as the guide.
[02:25:34.447 --> 02:25:36.248]  And intellect is again the tool.
[02:25:36.608 --> 02:25:42.490]  You know, you think a left brain... Isn't intellect a scientific attempt to scan the already great consciousness you have?
[02:25:42.770 --> 02:25:43.010]  Right.
[02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:44.631]  And it's just getting a snapshot.
[02:25:44.651 --> 02:25:46.792]  It's like a photograph, you know, out of your lifetime.
[02:25:46.852 --> 02:25:49.233]  And that's how much resolution they get out of that, right?
[02:25:50.333 --> 02:25:59.676]  What has changed, too, in the sciences, we've gone from sciences of the 60s and 1950s, where everything was a closed system, nothing interrelated, to now they... Uniform theory.
[02:25:59.916 --> 02:26:00.196]  Right.
[02:26:00.296 --> 02:26:02.037]  And now we know everything is connected.
[02:26:02.057 --> 02:26:02.337]  Unified.
[02:26:03.017 --> 02:26:05.058]  So we understand this.
[02:26:05.258 --> 02:26:05.918]  This is the good news.
[02:26:06.398 --> 02:26:07.719]  What is destiny, then?
[02:26:07.739 --> 02:26:18.462]  I mean, I think that is the shared will of the population, your individual vision, interfacing with that and understanding of where you want to go and the goals of the species.
[02:26:18.482 --> 02:26:19.743]  I mean, what would you call destiny?
[02:26:20.383 --> 02:26:25.625]  You know, I would say it is the collective creation that we all do.
[02:26:25.665 --> 02:26:27.666]  Again, creating the image and likeness of God, what does that mean?
[02:26:27.686 --> 02:26:29.507]  It means we're co-creators in a certain sense.
[02:26:29.867 --> 02:26:30.747]  We have certain potency.
[02:26:30.787 --> 02:26:35.689]  In fact, you know, what was the messaging was greater things you'll do also.
[02:26:35.709 --> 02:26:38.390]  You know, you can move mountains if you have the faith of a mustard seed.
[02:26:38.430 --> 02:26:40.471]  These are real concepts.
[02:26:40.531 --> 02:26:48.974]  In fact, in science, if you take two people and you put them together, you get a thing called resonance, which is a scientific principle, and it's X plus X in brackets, and you square it.
[02:26:49.694 --> 02:26:50.215]  Square it.
[02:26:50.495 --> 02:26:51.495]  It multiplies against itself.
[02:26:51.515 --> 02:26:52.076]  Exponential.
[02:26:52.276 --> 02:26:55.238]  Yes, this is what two or more gathered together means.
[02:26:55.659 --> 02:26:59.782]  When you combine the energy of two or more people, things happen.
[02:26:59.822 --> 02:27:00.882]  Especially a man and woman.
[02:27:01.183 --> 02:27:01.543]  Yes.
[02:27:01.563 --> 02:27:02.844]  And that's why that's under such attack.
[02:27:03.044 --> 02:27:03.865]  Yeah, and look at this.
[02:27:03.905 --> 02:27:08.528]  The man and woman, the relationship of that, is the type set on earth of the Godhead in heaven, right?
[02:27:08.608 --> 02:27:11.911]  And because when two are merged together, you get a third principle.
[02:27:12.611 --> 02:27:12.971]  Okay?
[02:27:13.512 --> 02:27:14.132]  A different view.
[02:27:14.152 --> 02:27:15.153]  So it's a microcosm of the Trinity.
[02:27:15.213 --> 02:27:16.374]  Yes, it is a microcosm.
[02:27:16.394 --> 02:27:17.295]  Which God creates.
[02:27:17.995 --> 02:27:18.175]  Right.
[02:27:18.215 --> 02:27:19.016]  And now there's creation.
[02:27:19.336 --> 02:27:19.577]  Right.
[02:27:19.657 --> 02:27:21.418]  And then what does that union bring?
[02:27:21.578 --> 02:27:22.879]  It brings creative work.
[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:26.403]  Both in the biological sense and in the metaphysical sense.
[02:27:26.543 --> 02:27:33.069]  Because when that energy of, this is a polarity world, this is a negative, positive, a female, a male.
[02:27:33.109 --> 02:27:34.510]  And the enemy, so who is the enemy?
[02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:36.712]  They're trying to sabotage that natural order.
[02:27:36.932 --> 02:27:46.283]  That's exactly right, and you see it in almost everything around us, from the sexualizing of children, or the un-sexualizing of children, I guess is a better way to say it.
[02:27:46.664 --> 02:27:47.324]  It ruins them.
[02:27:48.823 --> 02:27:51.325]  They're killing the potential they're supposed to have at germination.
[02:27:51.745 --> 02:27:52.345]  Exactly.
[02:27:52.505 --> 02:27:59.750]  And you know, the thing that I see so much of the world is, is the fake approach to what we are.
[02:27:59.910 --> 02:28:07.295]  And if we begin to start to reconcile what we are, this is what the government found in the big research on Minecraft, what they discovered... General Subtleby and all of it.
[02:28:07.576 --> 02:28:14.120]  All of them, they figured out, wow, if people really knew what they were and could actualize what they were, would we be in trouble?
[02:28:14.440 --> 02:28:18.163]  Because all the walls would come down.
[02:28:18.963 --> 02:28:21.085]  Transparency would be a real thing.
[02:28:21.285 --> 02:28:25.388]  And then, you think about it, then it's a matter of can we deal with it?
[02:28:25.408 --> 02:28:27.009]  So let's come back and talk about that.
[02:28:27.029 --> 02:28:30.011]  This is really important and how people understand.
[02:28:30.031 --> 02:28:34.675]  The biggest thing I see is the system makes people feel small because they're not financially successful or whatever.
[02:28:34.995 --> 02:28:38.858]  When you're already successful by being conscious, it doesn't mean you don't want to do new things or not be lazy.
[02:28:39.338 --> 02:28:43.401]  But when you stop feeling inadequate or powerless is when the power comes.
[02:28:43.561 --> 02:28:43.961]  That's it.
[02:28:44.322 --> 02:28:45.963]  And you know, there's a time when you let it go.
[02:28:45.983 --> 02:28:48.605]  And you recognize that you're not alone in this.
[02:28:48.686 --> 02:28:50.427]  The traumas create the change.
[02:28:50.847 --> 02:28:51.848]  That's the refinement.
[02:28:51.908 --> 02:28:52.489]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:28:52.509 --> 02:28:55.452]  The best thing for me in the last five years is to learn how to totally turn loose.
[02:28:56.012 --> 02:28:56.973]  And it's so powerful.
[02:28:56.993 --> 02:28:57.533]  We'll be right back.

[02:31:03.903 --> 02:31:08.085]  This young fella put himself in front of me and wouldn't move.
[02:31:08.945 --> 02:31:14.387]  So they get to go free and go about their life and possibly attack someone else.
[02:31:15.107 --> 02:31:17.548]  And I'm here to left with the aftermath of this bull.
[02:31:18.519 --> 02:31:22.624]  Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter.
[02:31:23.305 --> 02:31:35.320]  I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.
[02:31:35.880 --> 02:31:40.063]  This is about the closest I'll probably ever have in my life to an I am Spartacus moment.
[02:31:40.083 --> 02:31:46.308]  You know, that whole, suddenly America's like, the biggest oil producer and the biggest... that was me.
[02:31:46.728 --> 02:31:53.133]  His family was bitterly opposed to their relationship because she was part Native American.
[02:31:53.153 --> 02:31:59.158]  We landed in one of those corkscrew landings and ran out because they said there might be sniper fire.
[02:31:59.278 --> 02:32:01.900]  Why do we keep making the same mistake?
[02:32:02.840 --> 02:32:05.002]  Because we're desperate to get Trump out of office.
[02:32:05.262 --> 02:32:08.887]  With the return address said in big red, you know, like, CAPS.
[02:32:09.288 --> 02:32:09.688]  MAGA.
[02:32:10.469 --> 02:32:11.390]  Did I make that up too?
[02:32:12.632 --> 02:32:13.593]  Believe in something.
[02:32:14.415 --> 02:32:15.877]  Even if it never happened.

[02:32:58.167 --> 02:32:58.927]  InfoWars.
[02:32:59.287 --> 02:33:00.927]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:06.268 --> 02:33:08.889]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:17.558 --> 02:33:18.439]  You found it.
[02:33:18.779 --> 02:33:20.280]  The tip of the spear.
[02:33:20.801 --> 02:33:23.263]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.446 --> 02:33:39.557]  Okay, I've got a lot of technology news, a lot of world news with Dr. Nick Baggage.
[02:33:40.258 --> 02:33:42.740]  But, stripping everything away.
[02:33:43.763 --> 02:33:44.703]  You're not just saying this.
[02:33:44.723 --> 02:34:01.407]  When you read what the Pentagon is into, what you read what the EU's been studying, what the Russians are studying, they're obsessed with human potential and all of these powers of intuition and things that have been proven to be real, but that can't be harnessed by any centralized system.
[02:34:02.547 --> 02:34:11.649]  And any pro-freedom government or group promotes these things, any anti-human group attacks them.
[02:34:11.689 --> 02:34:13.229]  And there's definitely an anti-human
[02:34:14.545 --> 02:34:15.345]  I think we're good to go.
[02:34:44.537 --> 02:34:46.497]  Who this group is and what their goal is.
[02:34:46.517 --> 02:34:47.658]  I keep saying, what's the endgame?
[02:34:48.198 --> 02:34:53.999]  You know, I think it's within, you know, when you think of the wealth of the world, I think it's 80 families own half of it.
[02:34:54.399 --> 02:34:56.779]  And they want to keep that half and want to actually expand that.
[02:34:56.899 --> 02:34:58.159]  I think that really is part of it.
[02:34:58.219 --> 02:35:01.520]  And there are good, I mean, wealth is not a sin in and of itself.
[02:35:01.980 --> 02:35:04.840]  It's what you do with your wealth that determines whether it's good or bad.
[02:35:04.880 --> 02:35:10.821]  Just like driving an airplane, you know, you can either crash it into a building, and that's bad, or you can deliver the freight, right?
[02:35:10.921 --> 02:35:11.842]  I mean, and it's the same.
[02:35:11.862 --> 02:35:12.522]  Fly and see grandma.
[02:35:12.582 --> 02:35:12.782]  Yeah.
[02:35:14.142 --> 02:35:18.047]  It's about really, once again, about the choices that we choose to make.
[02:35:18.107 --> 02:35:22.633]  And when I think about the bigger plan, it's to shut down those individual choices.
[02:35:23.134 --> 02:35:24.275]  To take them away from you.
[02:35:24.676 --> 02:35:28.160]  To shut down the possibility of you reaching your higher states of awareness.
[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:29.602]  And the simplest way to do it... No, that's it.
[02:35:29.622 --> 02:35:31.865]  They're just taking avenues of consciousness away.
[02:35:32.105 --> 02:35:36.587]  That's exactly it, because if you're going to fight all this, we can attack each of the symptoms.
[02:35:36.967 --> 02:35:41.788]  And we do it all the time, and we hit the... That's what I'm saying, what is the root?
[02:35:41.988 --> 02:35:49.111]  It's bad behavior based on a lack of self-examination and recognition of our foundational divinity, and this is what they're stripping from us.
[02:35:49.931 --> 02:36:01.040]  If we can recognize the divinity of God and what God did by creating us in His image and likeness, that demands respect for one another.
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:01.521]  Let's be clear.
[02:36:01.901 --> 02:36:09.367]  Each of us, like Gandhi said, is true, and like Genesis says, is a literal new universe of free thought and free expression that God created.
[02:36:09.647 --> 02:36:13.430]  It doesn't mean that we've done what God's done, but it is the potentiality of the new universe.
[02:36:13.530 --> 02:36:15.672]  Right, and the idea is that, you know, we're
[02:36:16.232 --> 02:36:21.696]  We're here to explore, to encounter, and to remember, I think.
[02:36:22.176 --> 02:36:26.719]  Because I think if you go back to the root of what we are, if we remember that... It's all consciousness.
[02:36:26.739 --> 02:36:27.900]  It is all consciousness.
[02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:33.323]  And so then you come from consciousness into reality, because, I mean, again, read Genesis, you get the picture.
[02:36:33.904 --> 02:36:37.546]  And I think the science bears it out over the long term in terms of what we are.
[02:36:37.566 --> 02:36:44.711]  You know, we're the... a crystal, for instance, is the outward expression of the internal arrangement of atoms, which is
[02:36:45.251 --> 02:36:45.971]  We're good to go.
[02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:04.871]  All knowledge, all everything.
[02:37:04.891 --> 02:37:06.672]  You know, think about this from this perspective.
[02:37:06.912 --> 02:37:08.734]  And then you create something in your image and likeness.
[02:37:08.754 --> 02:37:10.255]  Well, there's a feedback loop there.
[02:37:10.955 --> 02:37:17.240]  You know, I mean, I think God experiences our living experience also through us and in us as we experience it.
[02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:22.724]  And because we have free will, yeah, you could, I mean, time and space exist in this reality, but no other.
[02:37:22.864 --> 02:37:28.168]  And so we see it, but actually everything got created and has happened like this.
[02:37:28.928 --> 02:37:29.909]  But we don't perceive it that way.
[02:37:29.929 --> 02:37:32.170]  We've got a slow rollout, you know?
[02:37:32.730 --> 02:37:37.533]  And so we're in the slow rollout, and when you get back far enough, you can see the order in the chaos.
[02:37:37.553 --> 02:37:40.494]  It's called a fractal, and that's what the universe is all about.
[02:37:40.854 --> 02:37:47.838]  And even this planet of a bunch of individual souls running around doing things, all these things do work together for good, whether we can see it or not.
[02:37:47.898 --> 02:37:55.485]  And that's why all these scientists that were atheists now go, OK, there is something outside creating an artificial reality, but it's still all a simulation.
[02:37:55.886 --> 02:37:59.349]  They're now offering, we'll build our new simulation better than whatever built this.
[02:37:59.649 --> 02:37:59.909]  Right.
[02:38:00.029 --> 02:38:01.150]  And you know, and here's the thing.
[02:38:01.771 --> 02:38:04.754]  You can give it that frame of words to describe it.
[02:38:05.134 --> 02:38:08.978]  And all you're doing is overlaying another set of words to describe the creation.
[02:38:09.747 --> 02:38:10.948]  That's described biblically.
[02:38:10.968 --> 02:38:15.994]  Because God's consciousness breathing out life in the universe, everything we do is just another expression of it.
[02:38:16.254 --> 02:38:20.860]  So as much as they run from God, it's just another... Yeah, you can't run from what you're in the middle of.
[02:38:21.120 --> 02:38:24.404]  And this is what they discovered, you know, is actually we're in the middle of it.
[02:38:24.564 --> 02:38:26.186]  You know, whatever created this, we're in it.
[02:38:26.626 --> 02:38:27.888]  And it's not disconnected.
[02:38:28.408 --> 02:38:29.989]  You're part of it like that cell in the body.
[02:38:30.049 --> 02:38:32.709]  And again, it's not some one-dimensional or two-dimensional simulation.
[02:38:32.769 --> 02:38:33.289]  It's real.
[02:38:33.490 --> 02:38:40.992]  Yeah, and when you think about sort of the multi-dimensional aspects of it, this is what science has also discovered, you know.
[02:38:41.012 --> 02:38:45.333]  So am I right to say, as I read a lot of the journals, that all the people that were atheists aren't anymore?
[02:38:45.333 --> 02:38:46.494]  They're like pretty freaked out.
[02:38:46.554 --> 02:38:48.035]  No, it's really shifted people.
[02:38:48.255 --> 02:38:53.118]  And in fact, I was at a conference a number of years ago, and it was called Religion, Science, and the Environment.
[02:38:53.258 --> 02:39:01.483]  And it was sponsored by the Orthodox, and the Catholics had people, the Buddhists, Muslims, everybody had people.
[02:39:01.503 --> 02:39:03.725]  The Aga Khan was even on board for the Muslims, right?
[02:39:03.785 --> 02:39:04.746]  And it was a closed conference.
[02:39:05.226 --> 02:39:12.791]  And what they decided in this, or one of the consensus points, was that science and religion should have never separated on the basis that
[02:39:14.172 --> 02:39:18.477]  The religious system of values gave science something.
[02:39:18.857 --> 02:39:21.640]  When you separated them, now you've got science without a value base?
[02:39:22.441 --> 02:39:25.624]  This is dangerous in a technocracy like what we have now.
[02:39:25.805 --> 02:39:32.071]  But humans' instinctive understanding of what they came from, expressed in the universe, turns out to be the right map of what it is.
[02:39:32.091 --> 02:39:34.254]  Yeah, it is, and so we're all the way rolling back.
[02:39:34.794 --> 02:39:38.375]  And now we have new words to describe what was described biblically.
[02:39:38.455 --> 02:39:39.816]  But the words say the same.
[02:39:39.836 --> 02:39:42.577]  So why is there evil that wants to destroy life in the world?
[02:39:42.597 --> 02:39:45.618]  That's because there's free will and some people are going to resonate towards evil.
[02:39:46.238 --> 02:39:47.899]  And so it's going to be expressed.
[02:39:48.279 --> 02:39:50.240]  Yeah, I think it is expressed in the world.
[02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:53.941]  I mean, if you want to take it, you know, a level deeper.
[02:39:53.961 --> 02:39:55.181]  People say, you know, God's a sadist.
[02:39:55.221 --> 02:39:55.962]  Why did God allow this?
[02:39:56.242 --> 02:39:56.842]  That's free will.
[02:39:57.771 --> 02:39:58.472]  It is free will.
[02:39:58.632 --> 02:40:08.607]  And see, it's like this, you know, I had, as you know, and we've talked about it before, I had a pretty devastating thing happen to me when I was young, and it would have been very easy to hate God for it when my dad disappeared.
[02:40:09.455 --> 02:40:11.737]  Um, but what I do know is it didn't do that.
[02:40:11.897 --> 02:40:19.263]  And what I realize is that even those really tough lessons, again, using the analogy... It accelerated you to be the man.
[02:40:19.564 --> 02:40:21.886]  Yeah, and you know, we do this with our two-year-olds, right?
[02:40:21.906 --> 02:40:23.307]  That's how God does it with us.
[02:40:23.807 --> 02:40:26.930]  And we're not the two-year-old in our minds, God's mind.
[02:40:26.950 --> 02:40:27.931]  But God three in the deep end.
[02:40:28.211 --> 02:40:33.152]  Yeah, he'll throw you in the deep end, and he's not going to let you drown, but you might get awful close.
[02:40:33.593 --> 02:40:38.394]  And that's when you cry out, and when you recognize the absolute power and grace of God.
[02:40:38.714 --> 02:40:48.497]  And I think it's in our torment, in our suffering, in our challenges, which I prefer to use the word challenges, that we remember who we are, we remember the base of our strength, and we come into it again.
[02:40:48.757 --> 02:40:56.179]  And you just said it, the whole nanny state is about, you're weak, you're fallen, never have rites and passages, never do the cultural rituals that activate.
[02:40:56.320 --> 02:40:56.800]  That's right.
[02:40:56.900 --> 02:41:00.781]  And these are, you know, in every tradition in the world, there are these rituals.
[02:41:01.221 --> 02:41:02.582]  And they go back millennia.
[02:41:03.502 --> 02:41:06.363]  About growth and understanding and when you come into your
[02:41:07.063 --> 02:41:07.944]  Yeah, and here's the thing.
[02:41:23.922 --> 02:41:26.464]  You can worry about the future, and a lot of people do.
[02:41:26.484 --> 02:41:28.725]  99% of what we worry about never happens.
[02:41:29.045 --> 02:41:33.408]  We can live in the past, which a lot of people do, and you're not going to get a chance to go back and do that again.
[02:41:33.968 --> 02:41:36.770]  Or you can live in the present and get some things done.
[02:41:36.790 --> 02:41:37.550]  And that's where we live.
[02:41:37.910 --> 02:41:41.873]  And that's why intuition, when it kicks in, that's a really present moment.
[02:41:41.973 --> 02:41:46.696]  That's when you are actively engaged, the awareness kicks in, the ego subordinates,
[02:41:47.136 --> 02:41:49.476]  Yeah, there's a metaphor I like to use.
[02:41:49.556 --> 02:41:59.998]  If you remember the story of John the Baptist is there and Christ is baptized and the dove descends on him, which is the vision of the Holy Spirit activating in him, right?
[02:42:00.078 --> 02:42:05.239]  And then he goes for 40 days in the desert and the devil's tempting him and he keeps saying, get behind me.
[02:42:05.599 --> 02:42:09.180]  The analogy here for me is the ego part of you.
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:15.661]  It's that devil he's thrown behind him, you know, to make, subordinate the ego.
[02:42:16.693 --> 02:42:19.594]  So that the awareness says, you serve me, ego.
[02:42:19.894 --> 02:42:20.614]  I don't serve you.
[02:42:20.854 --> 02:42:23.275]  And this is the opposite message of the world.
[02:42:23.315 --> 02:42:25.016]  The world says, you're there.
[02:42:25.036 --> 02:42:25.876]  Worship the ego.
[02:42:25.956 --> 02:42:26.936]  Worship the baseness.
[02:42:27.096 --> 02:42:27.256]  Yep.
[02:42:27.396 --> 02:42:28.577]  Instead of get behind me, Satan.
[02:42:28.797 --> 02:42:29.317]  That's right.
[02:42:29.437 --> 02:42:38.480]  And so the struggle individual... Put the animal behind, which again gives us control in the world and teaches us and trains the young ones as a tester.
[02:42:38.860 --> 02:42:41.361]  But the comet rushing through space-time is going forward.
[02:42:41.501 --> 02:42:41.961]  That's right.
[02:42:42.061 --> 02:42:43.041]  And that's where we need to be.
[02:42:43.221 --> 02:42:45.022]  Moving forward with creation.
[02:42:46.681 --> 02:42:48.442]  But then what is beyond that?
[02:42:48.462 --> 02:42:54.867]  Because I have a gut level that once we go to the next level, we're going to wake up in something even bigger and that there's some new challenge.
[02:42:55.087 --> 02:42:55.908]  Oh, I think that's true.
[02:42:56.048 --> 02:42:59.831]  I think the challenges are going to be huge and the forgiveness factor is going to be great.
[02:43:00.431 --> 02:43:13.581]  But I beg... I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[02:43:14.021 --> 02:43:14.461]  So please,
[02:43:15.475 --> 02:43:23.558]  Bear with me a few minutes, because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes of why am I sitting here with my shirt off.
[02:43:24.358 --> 02:43:24.938]  I'll explain.
[02:43:26.479 --> 02:43:30.680]  Our listeners, our viewers, are what Infowars really is.
[02:43:31.380 --> 02:43:38.423]  A populist, free market, pro-human movement that has detonated awakenings and resistance all over the world.
[02:43:39.243 --> 02:43:42.264]  We are the big giant tsunami coming in against globalist tyranny.
[02:43:43.149 --> 02:43:46.550]  You really are kicking globalist ass on every level.
[02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.670]  They're panicked.
[02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:50.491]  They thought that they had already won.
[02:43:52.111 --> 02:44:04.614]  But if they can still use corporate media to attack the leaders of the resistance to globalism, and if they can strip us of who we really are and then put banners on us like a NASCAR,
[02:44:06.678 --> 02:44:15.142]  And claim that we support racism, or we support abusing women, or we support all these things we don't support, they can win.
[02:44:16.583 --> 02:44:25.827]  That's why it's important to strip it all away, what they've claimed, what they've said, the straw men they've built, and to tell people what you really stand for.
[02:44:26.788 --> 02:44:31.670]  But in this world of thousands and thousands of channels and millions of hosts,
[02:44:32.796 --> 02:44:34.517]  The truth gets drowned out sometimes.
[02:44:34.537 --> 02:44:36.098]  That's what the globalists are hoping is going to happen.
[02:44:36.638 --> 02:44:41.480]  But out of all the shows and all the broadcasts out there, it's this show particularly they fear.
[02:44:42.141 --> 02:44:47.363]  Because we don't go off the pop culture they put out, we go off what they actually say and what they actually stand for.
[02:44:48.784 --> 02:44:55.487]  Now I was thinking, as 2018 ended, now four months ago, I was thinking, what have I dropped the ball on?
[02:44:56.087 --> 02:44:58.328]  What's one area in the info where we haven't been effective?
[02:44:58.889 --> 02:45:00.129]  Where we were effective previously?
[02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:01.170]  And that's
[02:45:02.597 --> 02:45:03.917]  Wearing our flags openly.
[02:45:04.818 --> 02:45:05.938]  Wearing our colors openly.
[02:45:07.599 --> 02:45:10.380]  And it starts with not being ashamed of the American flag that's under attack.
[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:12.761]  The official Democrats want to remove it.
[02:45:13.621 --> 02:45:18.243]  Want to take Thomas Jefferson off the money, saying he was a racist.
[02:45:18.323 --> 02:45:20.223]  I mean, they're even assaulting the flag now.
[02:45:20.323 --> 02:45:24.885]  So, they're projecting all their lies under our great symbol and its great history.
[02:45:26.277 --> 02:45:31.219]  First, we have to strip away the lies they've put on us, like logos.
[02:45:31.979 --> 02:45:41.824]  Racist, homophobe, anti-female, criminal, hoaxer, when they're the ones that are really doing all that.
[02:45:42.464 --> 02:45:48.866]  And then we have to display to everyone what we actually stand for, what we actually believe in.
[02:45:49.347 --> 02:45:51.908]  America and the world is already in a civil war.
[02:45:53.075 --> 02:45:54.797]  Pro-humans against the globalists.
[02:45:55.257 --> 02:45:58.140]  We have to wear our colors loud and proud.
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:01.082]  This is the best-seller right now for last year.
[02:46:01.102 --> 02:46:03.524]  The InfoWars In Your Face.
[02:46:04.305 --> 02:46:08.549]  You know, I said to listeners, I said, hey, we've got Molon Labe or we've got other shirts.
[02:46:08.569 --> 02:46:10.250]  We just want to meet like-minded people.
[02:46:11.511 --> 02:46:16.714]  But this shirt particularly, ladies and gentlemen, will really get in their face.
[02:46:17.134 --> 02:46:21.216]  And again, you'll get way more thumbs up and high fives and shake hands and meet friends.
[02:46:21.856 --> 02:46:27.219]  But there is that 1% or so out of the 100 people that see you that will say, F you, Russian Asian.
[02:46:27.699 --> 02:46:28.240]  F you, traitor.
[02:46:28.300 --> 02:46:30.020]  But again, those are pathetic bots.
[02:46:30.601 --> 02:46:35.083]  And they want to intimidate you to not exercise your free speech.
[02:46:35.163 --> 02:46:36.564]  So don't let them.
[02:46:36.624 --> 02:46:38.405]  Don't ever back down to their tyranny.
[02:46:39.205 --> 02:46:42.926]  This week only, we're running the biggest sell ever on t-shirts across the board.
[02:46:42.946 --> 02:46:44.006]  50% off.

[02:46:55.789 --> 02:46:57.889]  America has chosen InfoWars.
[02:46:58.269 --> 02:47:01.970]  Loud, pro-America, pro-freedom, and in the bullies' faces.
[02:47:06.275 --> 02:47:09.217]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.477 --> 02:47:33.290]  When it all crashes down And you break your crown And you put your finger But there's no one around It's just one-one thing Just to play the king When the castles crumble And you're left with just a name Where's your crown, king?
[02:47:33.310 --> 02:47:34.411]  Nothing
[02:47:43.817 --> 02:47:45.217]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:47:45.298 --> 02:47:48.278]  Paul Joseph Watson is set to take over in the fourth hour.
[02:47:48.298 --> 02:47:51.459]  Then, Owen Schroer will host the War Room.
[02:47:51.479 --> 02:47:53.600]  Dr. Nick Begich is in the studio until Friday with us.
[02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:56.161]  He'll be on with me, he'll be on with Owen, he'll be on with David Knight.
[02:47:56.221 --> 02:47:56.761]  Very excited.
[02:47:56.781 --> 02:48:02.123]  Everybody should read Earth Changes, The Ripple Effect, Alaska Sounds the Alarm.
[02:48:02.723 --> 02:48:08.385]  It's available at infowarestore.com or just go right to the Earth Pulse website, earthpulse.com.
[02:48:08.905 --> 02:48:09.685]  I don't care where you get it.
[02:48:10.065 --> 02:48:11.606]  Want to get real research on mind control?
[02:48:12.614 --> 02:48:16.137]  Mind control, a brave new world, or enhancing human performance?
[02:48:16.197 --> 02:48:19.400]  See, they're wanting mind control to suppress our performance.
[02:48:19.821 --> 02:48:20.681]  Harp the update.
[02:48:20.762 --> 02:48:21.762]  Angels don't play this harp.
[02:48:23.037 --> 02:48:41.188]  Technology in the 21st Century, Controlling the Human Mind, the book, The Technologies of Political Control and Tools for Peak Performance, Angels Don't Play This Harp, the original book from 20 years ago, Earth Rising, the Revolution Towards a Thousand Years of Peace, Earth Rising II, The Betrayal of Science, Society, and the Soul.
[02:48:41.569 --> 02:48:46.972]  And while you're here, I want you back on tomorrow, though, to get into nuts and bolts about 5G, electronic-controlled
[02:48:48.587 --> 02:48:54.190]  All the admissions that, you know, this stuff is killing young people, the attention spans are shrinking.
[02:48:54.210 --> 02:48:56.792]  You know, we've gotten into positive things here, our potential.
[02:48:56.812 --> 02:48:57.933]  We have to look at the negative.
[02:48:58.073 --> 02:48:58.293]  Right.
[02:48:58.533 --> 02:48:59.654]  And this larger agenda.
[02:48:59.674 --> 02:49:05.677]  But just continue with the other points you want to make, Dr. Baggish, because you're really making, I think, some profound points here.
[02:49:06.638 --> 02:49:08.859]  How can the globalists know we have all this potential?
[02:49:09.019 --> 02:49:11.181]  And you've worked with some of the top billionaires out there off record.
[02:49:12.273 --> 02:49:27.119]  And then still try to suppress it when any common sense or analysis or even gut level analysis, which as Trump says, shallowness is the deepest thing because it's an instant spiritual gestalt, tells you that if you suppress others, you suppress yourself.
[02:49:27.559 --> 02:49:29.040]  Why doesn't the establishment get that?
[02:49:29.909 --> 02:49:31.851]  You know, I think it's fear-driven also.
[02:49:31.871 --> 02:49:35.414]  You know, this is what drives so much of the bad decisions everyone makes.
[02:49:35.734 --> 02:49:43.341]  Fear, greed, I mean, those negative aspects of what we are as human beings tend to take the forefront.
[02:49:44.402 --> 02:49:49.607]  When people have done a lot of things that are wrong and they know it, you know, because we all know, I mean, we all know, right?
[02:49:50.167 --> 02:49:53.910]  And when you think about transparency and what this change brings about is
[02:49:55.202 --> 02:49:57.646]  We're going to know the truth about everyone.
[02:49:57.667 --> 02:50:01.493]  You know, this is the opening of the book of life we were talking about a little bit during the break.
[02:50:02.208 --> 02:50:08.691]  They're afraid of what will happen if we see into our governments, see into these corporations... And isn't it funny?
[02:50:09.152 --> 02:50:13.814]  You're talking about total telekinesis, human link, which the globalist already knows is coming.
[02:50:14.574 --> 02:50:16.876]  And that's not some new age thing that's mathematically been proven.
[02:50:16.916 --> 02:50:17.496]  It's increasing.
[02:50:17.836 --> 02:50:18.556]  They're trying to block it.
[02:50:18.756 --> 02:50:21.378]  But they're trying to create AI that already knows omnipresence.
[02:50:21.398 --> 02:50:27.821]  So they fear humans having omnipresence or partial omnipresence, the beginnings of it, the singularity of consciousness.
[02:50:28.101 --> 02:50:29.422]  But then they're creating artificiality.
[02:50:29.722 --> 02:50:31.803]  Right, and here's the thing about the artificial side.
[02:50:31.884 --> 02:50:33.665]  It won't be a hundred percent.
[02:50:34.145 --> 02:50:36.867]  It'll be like 99, but it looks so good, it's predictability.
[02:50:36.887 --> 02:50:40.890]  Plus, how can somebody that even look at that if they don't have that consciousness and even read it?
[02:50:41.170 --> 02:50:53.798]  Right, and so, you know, when you think about, again, these attributes of human beings, what the military now calls anomalous human potentials, which used to be referred to as extrasensory perceptions.
[02:50:54.078 --> 02:50:59.302]  When you go back to the beginning of a lot of these programs, what they discovered was these weren't extra at all.
[02:51:00.142 --> 02:51:01.504]  These weren't anomalous at all.
[02:51:02.164 --> 02:51:05.026]  These are things that we actually have within us.
[02:51:05.107 --> 02:51:11.812]  Now those are innate capacities of communication, are really telepathically driven.
[02:51:11.912 --> 02:51:13.093]  We just don't perceive it all.
[02:51:13.453 --> 02:51:14.494]  The science proves it.
[02:51:14.514 --> 02:51:15.855]  There's some really good research.
[02:51:15.875 --> 02:51:19.018]  And by the way, again, the military particularly knows this because it's been tested under pressure.
[02:51:19.058 --> 02:51:19.478]  That's right.
[02:51:19.498 --> 02:51:20.819]  And it gets even stronger under pressure.
[02:51:20.919 --> 02:51:21.400]  Absolutely.
[02:51:23.001 --> 02:51:24.563]  Trauma brings about some of these.
[02:51:24.583 --> 02:51:31.553]  You know, I've talked and had opportunities to meet with people that have had further spontaneous activation of some of these attributes.
[02:51:31.593 --> 02:51:40.545]  And they happen in the midst of trauma, almost like a defense mechanism where your inner self says, hey man, if you want to survive, you better wake up to what you are.
[02:51:41.317 --> 02:51:44.300]  Now think about that in the context of the global situation right now.
[02:51:44.340 --> 02:51:47.242]  It says the enemy's coming over the hill right there, not here, not there.
[02:51:47.522 --> 02:51:59.413]  It happens to me, like I'm in Congress, there's five doors that the Sundar Pichai or whoever's going to come out of, and I know the one, I literally tell the military guys, that's the door, they nod and they know too, and we know they're coming out that door.
[02:51:59.953 --> 02:52:00.754]  It's like always right.
[02:52:00.874 --> 02:52:02.595]  Yeah, and intuition usually is.
[02:52:02.655 --> 02:52:05.197]  In fact, I would say it always is if you're paying attention to it.
[02:52:05.217 --> 02:52:06.198]  We usually don't.
[02:52:06.358 --> 02:52:09.381]  And this is, and as we don't, this is the voice, right?
[02:52:09.621 --> 02:52:10.962]  I mean, this is your consciousness.
[02:52:10.982 --> 02:52:13.464]  Because our brain has been proven to be broadcasting and receiving.
[02:52:13.764 --> 02:52:14.385]  It's scanning.
[02:52:14.425 --> 02:52:15.005]  It's a sensor.
[02:52:15.325 --> 02:52:15.525]  Right.
[02:52:15.926 --> 02:52:21.070]  Now here's what, you know, when you think about extrasensory perceptions, you think of energy mostly.
[02:52:21.110 --> 02:52:22.331]  You think about it, these are energy things.
[02:52:22.751 --> 02:52:28.755]  But if you think about our regular perceptions, sight for instance, that's an energy thing, although we put physical attributes on it.
[02:52:28.775 --> 02:52:30.416]  It's picking up electromagnetic energy.
[02:52:30.616 --> 02:52:42.844]  Right, and the bandwidth for visual on the electromagnetic spectrum is this little narrow bandwidth, and then on the sides of it are ultraviolet and infrared that we don't see, but other species do see, because they have
[02:52:43.564 --> 02:52:45.064]  Bigger bandwidth, all right?
[02:52:45.124 --> 02:52:46.225]  Now, hearing is the same way.
[02:52:46.265 --> 02:52:47.145]  It's bandwidth, right?
[02:52:47.165 --> 02:52:51.085]  It's the vibration that the ear picks up and translates through our physical system into sound.
[02:52:51.105 --> 02:52:51.425]  And smell.
[02:52:51.746 --> 02:52:52.826]  And smell is the same way.
[02:52:52.866 --> 02:52:53.946]  And they say it's particles.
[02:52:54.006 --> 02:52:54.366]  It's not.
[02:52:54.446 --> 02:52:55.466]  It's vibration, all right?
[02:52:55.486 --> 02:52:56.766]  This is what the science is showing us.
[02:52:57.166 --> 02:52:59.427]  And so, the particles put off a vibration.
[02:52:59.587 --> 02:52:59.887]  Right.
[02:53:00.387 --> 02:53:03.348]  And those are picked up, and then those are understood for what they are.
[02:53:03.388 --> 02:53:10.629]  And so, when you think about all of our perceptive windows, are all electromagnetic spectrum-related,
[02:53:11.443 --> 02:53:11.603]  Yeah.
[02:53:28.061 --> 02:53:28.401]  I think so.
[02:53:50.995 --> 02:54:00.879]  The idea is to find the balance between chaos, the right side of the brain, and order, the left side of the brain, and find the middle way that brings chaos and order together.
[02:54:00.919 --> 02:54:02.800]  That's male and female again.
[02:54:02.820 --> 02:54:04.220]  It gets back to that same analogy.
[02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:07.701]  When you have union, then you have possibilities.
[02:54:07.741 --> 02:54:16.985]  In fact, they say the highest IQs are when both hemispheres of the brain balance, and then you create a resonance between both, and then you get this super brain, right?
[02:54:17.685 --> 02:54:21.107]  That's what human beings were raised, born into.
[02:54:21.607 --> 02:54:25.208]  Our brain balance as children is really obvious.
[02:54:25.528 --> 02:54:28.530]  And if you look at the scans, as we get older, it gravitates.
[02:54:28.550 --> 02:54:29.770]  They try to use the TV.
[02:54:29.930 --> 02:54:31.091]  That was an article I wanted to bring up.
[02:54:31.811 --> 02:54:36.413]  That attention spans are the lowest ever, and they're plunging even faster.
[02:54:36.933 --> 02:54:38.834]  And the system admits they're targeting that.
[02:54:39.154 --> 02:54:41.395]  Why would you target the heart of civilization?
[02:54:41.736 --> 02:54:42.916]  Why would you target attention span?
[02:54:42.936 --> 02:54:46.838]  Because then, it's almost like the activation to consciousness, the door to consciousness,
[02:54:48.098 --> 02:54:53.682]  Is the attention span that you remember things, instead of you're always in the new moment, you're basically a slave.
[02:54:53.962 --> 02:55:05.990]  If you follow any relaxation or meditation practices, even prayer, is to stay focused on one thing, and your mind drifts immediately, right?
[02:55:06.050 --> 02:55:07.051]  It just always does.
[02:55:07.591 --> 02:55:16.978]  Now the brains are being trained to drift deliberately, so you never can be focused, you can never reach higher states of awareness, where you can actually let the awareness rule.
[02:55:18.078 --> 02:55:26.142]  This is what's happening, is the fractured way of thinking, the breaking of focus, continually throws the ego in front of every decision.
[02:55:26.302 --> 02:55:30.384]  And notice the trends, which is a human vision, are getting shorter and shorter where we're all broken up.
[02:55:30.884 --> 02:55:31.124]  Right.
[02:55:31.704 --> 02:55:34.866]  And this is, look at how the brain is being trained.
[02:55:35.146 --> 02:55:37.247]  I mean, you're interrupted 50 million times.
[02:55:37.827 --> 02:55:40.749]  Kids are looking at their cell phones three and four hundred times a day.
[02:55:42.568 --> 02:55:43.269]  For messaging.
[02:55:43.809 --> 02:55:44.590]  For feedback.
[02:55:44.990 --> 02:55:51.715]  Because all of these things, it's about keeping your attention in the digital economy, which is an attention economy.
[02:55:52.316 --> 02:56:00.443]  It's to keep you in the internet, in the data feed, in the propaganda program, as opposed to into your own thinking.
[02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:02.424]  You need to internalize a bit more.
[02:56:02.564 --> 02:56:04.005]  We need to go inside a bit more.
[02:56:04.025 --> 02:56:06.508]  When you think about AI and what's coming,
[02:56:07.208 --> 02:56:11.635]  The computers are already so complex in writing their own programs, we can't even figure them out.
[02:56:11.715 --> 02:56:13.258]  And we're at the very beginning of the quiz!
[02:56:13.278 --> 02:56:13.578]  Must be clear!
[02:56:15.365 --> 02:56:15.925]  Every metric.
[02:56:15.965 --> 02:56:19.087]  The computers are advancing and getting more sophisticated.
[02:56:19.267 --> 02:56:20.167]  We're going down.
[02:56:20.447 --> 02:56:21.508]  We're losing attention span.
[02:56:21.528 --> 02:56:22.408]  We're losing consciousness.
[02:56:22.668 --> 02:56:23.389]  We're losing IQ.
[02:56:23.409 --> 02:56:24.369]  We're losing physical health.
[02:56:24.829 --> 02:56:24.989]  Right.
[02:56:25.009 --> 02:56:27.650]  So as this thing builds, we're dying.
[02:56:27.911 --> 02:56:28.091]  Yeah.
[02:56:28.271 --> 02:56:32.172]  And I think it's not an accident, you know, from my perspective.
[02:56:32.573 --> 02:56:37.015]  When you think about the World Wide Web, PBS a number of years ago did a show.
[02:56:37.035 --> 02:56:37.375]  Stay there.
[02:56:37.435 --> 02:56:39.696]  Paul Watson's coming over in six minutes to take over.
[02:56:40.016 --> 02:56:40.556]  Let's go to break.
[02:56:40.576 --> 02:56:41.356]  Come back with five minutes.
[02:56:42.237 --> 02:56:44.338]  Postgames, books and films, infowarestore.com.
[02:56:45.549 --> 02:56:46.970]  Store-wide free shipping is still there.
[02:56:47.010 --> 02:56:49.151]  We had to stop the supplement sales except for DNA Force.
[02:56:49.171 --> 02:56:49.891]  It's about to sell out.
[02:56:50.212 --> 02:56:50.912]  Take advantage of that.
[02:56:50.932 --> 02:56:53.513]  And we have 50% off all apparel.
[02:56:53.714 --> 02:56:59.617]  I want you to wear an InfoWar shirt, or an Attorney Response Team shirt, or a Don't Tread on Me shirt, or a Molon Labe shirt.
[02:57:00.297 --> 02:57:01.718]  Over 100 shirts, 50% off.
[02:57:01.738 --> 02:57:04.439]  That's designer shirts, regular search.
[02:57:04.820 --> 02:57:05.640]  They're all there.
[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:06.921]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:57:10.473 --> 02:57:12.794]  Or 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:57:12.814 --> 02:57:17.958]  And again, we have storable food, two-week supply at cost.
[02:57:18.018 --> 02:57:21.881]  We have the Alexa Pure Breeze, $50 off, incredibly low price.
[02:57:22.462 --> 02:57:25.324]  And so much more at InfoWorksTour.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:57:25.344 --> 02:57:29.927]  It's your funding of this operation that makes it all possible.
[02:57:30.327 --> 02:57:32.129]  But our Nick Begich is kicking butt.
[02:57:33.575 --> 02:57:44.699]  We'll talk more about this whole situation on the other side, and then Paul Watson from Her Britannic Majesty's England on Notre Dame and The Globalist, and all the rest of it is straight ahead.
[02:57:45.220 --> 02:57:46.980]  There's a reason they want this broadcast shut down.
[02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:47.721]  We're pro-human.
[02:57:48.181 --> 02:57:48.921]  We believe in you.
[02:57:49.321 --> 02:57:50.122]  We believe in humanity.
[02:57:50.142 --> 02:57:50.542]  Stay with us.
[02:57:52.803 --> 02:57:55.824]  Now to a dire warning about climate change.
[02:57:57.316 --> 02:57:58.197]  A dire warning.
[02:57:58.217 --> 02:57:58.918]  A dire warning.
[02:57:58.938 --> 02:57:59.759]  A dire warning.
[02:57:59.779 --> 02:58:00.641]  A dire new warning.
[02:58:00.801 --> 02:58:01.442]  A dire warning.
[02:58:01.522 --> 02:58:02.523]  Another dire warning.
[02:58:02.543 --> 02:58:03.905]  The situation is dire.
[02:58:04.386 --> 02:58:05.267]  A dire warning.
[02:58:05.287 --> 02:58:06.508]  Dire consequences.
[02:58:06.548 --> 02:58:07.610]  A dire warning.
[02:58:07.650 --> 02:58:08.551]  It sounds dire.
[02:58:08.611 --> 02:58:09.973]  What prompted this warning?
[02:58:10.033 --> 02:58:11.896]  We have a global emergency.
[02:58:13.402 --> 02:58:17.644]  It's here, it's man-made, and there are going to be dire results.
[02:58:17.664 --> 02:58:23.806]  The government issued its most dramatic report yet about climate change today, and it came with a dire warning.
[02:58:23.906 --> 02:58:24.927]  A stark warning.
[02:58:25.047 --> 02:58:27.028]  A warning to humanity.
[02:58:27.088 --> 02:58:30.869]  An existential threat to human civilization on this planet.
[02:58:30.989 --> 02:58:34.811]  Experts say that we have until 2030 to avoid catastrophe.
[02:58:34.951 --> 02:58:40.873]  And we, the scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[02:58:40.893 --> 02:58:42.994]  12 years in which to act.
[02:58:44.901 --> 02:58:48.105]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[02:58:48.145 --> 02:58:50.749]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[02:58:50.909 --> 02:58:53.933]  By the year 2030, that's just 12 years from now.
[02:58:54.013 --> 02:58:57.117]  The future is closer than we think and is not good.
[02:58:57.238 --> 02:58:59.601]  There will be irreversible damage to the planet.
[02:59:00.021 --> 02:59:04.924]  Time is running out to prevent global warming from reaching a catastrophic milestone.
[02:59:04.984 --> 02:59:06.265]  Sea levels rising.
[02:59:06.285 --> 02:59:06.945]  Extreme drought.
[02:59:06.966 --> 02:59:07.906]  Severe storms.
[02:59:08.006 --> 02:59:10.588]  Widespread fires and extreme flooding.
[02:59:10.688 --> 02:59:11.909]  Dangerous heatwaves.
[02:59:12.029 --> 02:59:15.151]  Rising sea levels and forcing millions from their homes.
[02:59:15.351 --> 02:59:17.772]  Crop failure and mass population movement.
[02:59:17.792 --> 02:59:18.913]  As well as food shortages.
[02:59:18.973 --> 02:59:21.795]  Millions around the world face future disaster.
[02:59:21.955 --> 02:59:22.575]  Pretty serious.
[02:59:22.615 --> 02:59:23.696]  People are dying.
[02:59:23.716 --> 02:59:27.378]  President Trump has frequently doubted its existence and has called it a hoax.
[02:59:27.518 --> 02:59:28.119]  I don't believe it.
[02:59:30.183 --> 02:59:31.925]  The world is gonna end in 12 years.
[02:59:33.146 --> 02:59:40.934]  From the creators of the Russian Collusion Conspiracy and the Jussie Smollett hate crime, this summer, be afraid.
[02:59:41.334 --> 02:59:43.336]  Be very afraid.
[02:59:43.576 --> 02:59:45.238]  Like, this is the war.
[02:59:45.278 --> 02:59:46.599]  This is our World War II.
[02:59:46.779 --> 02:59:48.601]  Countdown to Apocalypse 2030.
[02:59:48.981 --> 02:59:51.944]  We're all gonna die.
[02:59:56.798 --> 03:00:01.042]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:01.302 --> 03:00:08.948]  And we're gonna ride.
[03:00:11.690 --> 03:00:13.392]  We're gonna ride.
[03:00:16.154 --> 03:00:21.138]  Ride like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind.
[03:00:21.278 --> 03:00:22.519]  We're gonna ride.
[03:00:24.229 --> 03:00:25.849]  All right, Paul Watson, look at him right there.
[03:00:26.269 --> 03:00:27.290]  He is coming up.
[03:00:28.130 --> 03:00:31.191]  Loaded for bear in the War Room, 3 o'clock Central, in one hour from now.
[03:00:31.651 --> 03:00:33.711]  That'll be Nick Baggage riding a shotgun with us throughout the week.
[03:00:34.731 --> 03:00:38.032]  Great futurist researcher and proven super accurate.
[03:00:40.193 --> 03:00:41.653]  It's hard to turn off, Will.
[03:00:41.693 --> 03:00:46.674]  I'm turning it off for a minute.
[03:00:47.054 --> 03:00:48.615]  It's a live rendition.
[03:00:49.295 --> 03:00:51.455]  Just a touch.
[03:00:51.495 --> 03:00:53.556]  Sadness in her fingers.
[03:00:56.465 --> 03:01:00.008]  Thunder and lightning in her sight.
[03:01:01.009 --> 03:01:04.171]  The crowd goes, what happened?
[03:01:04.812 --> 03:01:05.973]  And we're gonna ride.
[03:01:05.993 --> 03:01:06.774]  I'm getting serious.
[03:01:07.354 --> 03:01:16.542]  In closing, this attack on consciousness, this attack on independence, this attempt to make us domesticated, is it just fallen people wanting to dominate and control?
[03:01:16.562 --> 03:01:19.884]  Because you study the globalists, I mean, they know there's this huge human potential.
[03:01:20.445 --> 03:01:24.208]  Don't they understand that they'll never reach that potential by trying to dominate humanity?
[03:01:24.708 --> 03:01:27.830]  You know, I think that's, again, it's delusion.
[03:01:28.090 --> 03:01:31.531]  You know, you get lost in your world of materialism.
[03:01:31.952 --> 03:01:35.693]  And the opposite of that is really awareness.
[03:01:35.914 --> 03:01:37.434]  I mean, it's that other side of the thing.
[03:01:37.474 --> 03:01:42.717]  And so if you're totally focused on things and acquiring and accumulating in the world, you miss the point.
[03:01:43.417 --> 03:01:47.782]  All of these things that we experience, from my perspective, are the training ground for the soul.
[03:01:48.223 --> 03:01:54.229]  You know, this is where we learn and we fall back into remembering what we are and what our potentials are.
[03:01:54.870 --> 03:02:00.336]  It scares the hell out of globalists, the idea that some individual could rise up and create something new.
[03:02:00.376 --> 03:02:04.060]  And you think about the new wealth in the world, that was sort of like that, you know, if you think about it.
[03:02:04.460 --> 03:02:11.569]  That's why they want to surveil every person and control them is to control those technologies, to control those disruptive systems.
[03:02:11.709 --> 03:02:12.650]  That's exactly right.
[03:02:12.690 --> 03:02:22.923]  And here's the thing that I think we all need to remember is if we fall back into what we are and we begin to not tolerate one another but accept one another as different
[03:02:23.823 --> 03:02:24.923]  Unique creations.
[03:02:25.723 --> 03:02:27.684]  And in that way, we respect each other differently.
[03:02:27.724 --> 03:02:29.684]  We approach each other differently.
[03:02:29.744 --> 03:02:36.005]  We come into a conversation not with anger and hatred, but with the love that God is.
[03:02:36.265 --> 03:02:40.626]  And if we truly believe this, then we need to begin acting this way.
[03:02:40.726 --> 03:02:48.508]  And this is the challenge for this generation, is to wake up to what we are, begin to manifest the gifts of the Spirit, and that's what will change the world.
[03:02:48.628 --> 03:02:50.668]  The rest of it is all window dressing.
[03:02:52.711 --> 03:02:53.011]  You're right.
[03:02:53.051 --> 03:02:54.573]  Paul Watson takes over in a few minutes.
[03:02:55.194 --> 03:02:57.457]  In two minutes, what would you quantify?
[03:02:57.497 --> 03:02:59.339]  What would you call this period of time?
[03:02:59.379 --> 03:03:02.603]  I mean, the globalists are legitimately, I think, scared right now.
[03:03:02.804 --> 03:03:04.025]  It's a great awakening.
[03:03:04.365 --> 03:03:04.646]  It is.
[03:03:04.886 --> 03:03:06.488]  And here's what I know about that.
[03:03:07.109 --> 03:03:08.491]  The bigger the possibility,
[03:03:09.091 --> 03:03:13.955]  Of something positive, the more negative stuff you're going to see, because that is the way the world works.
[03:03:14.216 --> 03:03:15.737]  For every action there's an opposite negative.
[03:03:15.877 --> 03:03:16.478]  And it has to be.
[03:03:16.578 --> 03:03:22.743]  And so the fact that good's rising so much is going to, like the new Godzilla movie, the evil titans are going to rise as well.
[03:03:22.783 --> 03:03:22.963]  Right.
[03:03:23.083 --> 03:03:28.588]  And so the conflict between the two also raises up, and you get to option, the choices become more obvious.
[03:03:29.009 --> 03:03:33.653]  And the biggest missing link in all of this, ultimately, is going to be forgiveness.
[03:03:34.293 --> 03:03:38.894]  And that's a 2,000-year-old message we need to remember today, that we all have made mistakes.
[03:03:39.654 --> 03:03:46.716]  We are all going to be accountable for those mistakes, but more importantly, I think we're going to be accountable for the good things we do.
[03:03:46.836 --> 03:03:48.456]  And we need to put more emphasis on that.
[03:03:48.476 --> 03:03:51.257]  Now you're right, because we never celebrate our victories.
[03:03:51.417 --> 03:03:51.917]  That's right.
[03:03:52.057 --> 03:03:54.558]  We always are worried about the next problem, but then we should celebrate the victories.
[03:03:54.618 --> 03:04:00.219]  We should, and we should recognize that those victories are every day, again, going back to meaning versus purpose.
[03:04:00.739 --> 03:04:03.280]  Meaning is expressing your value system in everything you do.
[03:04:03.920 --> 03:04:10.141]  You can throw that pebble in the pond every day by the way you treat people, and you have no idea where those waves go.
[03:04:10.522 --> 03:04:16.083]  The smallest thing you did in your life might actually turn out to be the biggest, and you won't know until you leap to the other side.
[03:04:16.503 --> 03:04:18.283]  So, keep your intention clean.
[03:04:18.843 --> 03:04:20.724]  Self-examination, keep that clean.
[03:04:21.324 --> 03:04:29.606]  Be able to acknowledge your shortcomings and overcome them, but don't be so self-condemning you commit blasphemy against the creation, the highest creation, human beings yourself.
[03:04:30.106 --> 03:04:32.869]  Treat yourself like you would treat someone you really care about.
[03:04:32.889 --> 03:04:35.011]  You're right, and the whole globalist system is humans are crap.
[03:04:35.071 --> 03:04:37.073]  No, we're the highest form of life on this planet.
[03:04:37.233 --> 03:04:39.355]  That's exactly right, and we're stewards for this planet.
[03:04:39.375 --> 03:04:40.877]  We have obligations here to each other.
[03:04:40.897 --> 03:04:42.158]  And we can build unlimited planets.
[03:04:42.218 --> 03:04:46.702]  We can build this thing into the most beautiful garden once again.
[03:04:46.762 --> 03:04:47.763]  We have the opportunity.
[03:04:47.883 --> 03:04:49.225]  In this century, we can do this.
[03:04:50.188 --> 03:04:50.688]  Powerful.
[03:04:50.828 --> 03:04:51.609]  Dr. Nick Baggage.
[03:04:52.189 --> 03:04:52.570]  All right.

[03:05:55.046 --> 03:05:57.308]  Available at Infowarslife.com today.
[03:05:57.348 --> 03:06:00.009]  News, analysis, reports.
[03:06:00.210 --> 03:06:02.211]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:04.973 --> 03:06:07.514]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:20.013 --> 03:06:26.137]  And we are live on this April 16th 2019 edition in the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:26.717 --> 03:06:39.325]  Well BuzzFeed has been caught putting out a giant fake news conspiracy theory while at the same time calling for people like me to be de-platformed for putting out fake news conspiracy theories.
[03:06:39.706 --> 03:06:44.789]  This of course has to do with the horrific tragic Notre Dame fire which happened yesterday.
[03:06:45.774 --> 03:06:55.382]  And we're going to play this full report at the end of this hour, but I'm going to go through it because there have been even more developments since I put the video out about an hour ago.
[03:06:55.963 --> 03:07:04.510]  So basically, as happens with many of these instances, whether it be Islamic terrorism or accidental fires like the one we had yesterday,
[03:07:05.427 --> 03:07:20.835]  Anytime you go on news pages, specifically Facebook pages, and specifically ones in the Arab world, a lot of people on those pages are celebrating the attacks, or they're celebrating the fire, and that's exactly what happened yesterday.
[03:07:21.776 --> 03:07:29.220]  Now, I put out a tweet yesterday, which was from a French journalist called Daniel Roux,
[03:07:30.214 --> 03:07:32.655]  And it was what you see right up on screen there.
[03:07:32.695 --> 03:07:35.896]  This was a feed from a live stream of the Notre Dame burning in the background.
[03:07:36.396 --> 03:07:40.598]  These are the happy faces that responded to this video.
[03:07:40.658 --> 03:07:46.300]  Now this was a French video by a French news agency which was a live coverage of the Notre Dame fire.
[03:07:46.660 --> 03:07:52.302]  They see quite a lot of Arabic names responding to the Notre Dame fire with smiley faces.
[03:07:53.262 --> 03:07:54.723]  So I put this out in a tweet.
[03:07:55.740 --> 03:08:01.702]  And I said, a brief summary of who is responding to the tragic Notre Dame fire with smiley faces on Facebook.
[03:08:02.322 --> 03:08:04.143]  Now, I didn't say Muslims, God forbid.
[03:08:04.163 --> 03:08:18.248]  I just said, this is horrific, this is vile, people should not be celebrating a horrific fire, the destruction of an ancient, you know, 850-year-old building of such importance to the Western world with smiley faces.
[03:08:18.288 --> 03:08:18.908]  This is vile.
[03:08:19.808 --> 03:08:20.388]  This is horrible.
[03:08:20.709 --> 03:08:24.570]  Didn't even mention Muslims, just said this is bad, we should condemn this, basically.
[03:08:25.325 --> 03:08:39.896]  Within about two hours after that tweet went viral, BuzzFeed put out a report entitled, and they've changed it since, which we're going to get into because they're completely backpedaling, here are the hoaxes and misinformation about the Notre Dame fire.
[03:08:40.536 --> 03:08:51.785]  So they initially claimed, BuzzFeed, that this video provided, quote, zero evidence Muslims were responding to the fire with smiley faces.
[03:08:52.896 --> 03:08:55.718]  So that video was apparently either fake or it didn't exist.
[03:08:56.118 --> 03:09:03.023]  They went on to claim, and this is from their original article, which they've now scrubbed, because they're backpedaling like cowards.
[03:09:03.763 --> 03:09:08.687]  They said, critically, the video in question does not show what people on Facebook were reacting to.
[03:09:10.048 --> 03:09:10.788]  Yes, it did.
[03:09:10.808 --> 03:09:14.691]  It showed it at the very beginning at the top of the screen.
[03:09:14.711 --> 03:09:22.516]  If you zoom into the top of the screen on the video of the Facebook feed, and this is in my video that I just put out a couple of hours ago,
[03:09:23.835 --> 03:09:28.523]  The burning Notre Dame is clearly in the background because that video was taken from another video.
[03:09:28.543 --> 03:09:29.505]  There you see it right at the top.
[03:09:29.946 --> 03:09:34.794]  If you go to the start of that video and just pause right at the start before it scrolls down, you can see that.
[03:09:36.474 --> 03:09:38.196]  The Notre Dame burning in the background.
[03:09:38.576 --> 03:09:40.197]  The video, there you go, right there.
[03:09:40.498 --> 03:09:42.179]  There's the Notre Dame burning in the background.
[03:09:42.219 --> 03:09:49.485]  That is taken from a French news source called Brut, which was covering the live feed of the Notre Dame burning.
[03:09:49.866 --> 03:09:52.008]  And the reactions below it, the smiley faces.
[03:09:52.528 --> 03:09:59.194]  So they lied in saying that the Facebook, that the video, did not show what people on Facebook were reacting to.
[03:09:59.454 --> 03:10:00.175]  Yes, it did.
[03:10:00.195 --> 03:10:01.276]  That was a lie.
[03:10:02.645 --> 03:10:06.846]  They also said it's impossible to know the religious views of each person reacting to a video en masse.
[03:10:07.466 --> 03:10:13.708]  Okay, well, we can get to the comments of certain people and you can probably try and guess their religion later on.
[03:10:14.648 --> 03:10:23.571]  So they put out this lie that this video had no source, was probably made up, and was not a video of people reacting to the Notre Dame fire, which it was.
[03:10:24.938 --> 03:10:28.220]  It was a Facebook stream where they were reacting to the Notre Dame fire.
[03:10:28.560 --> 03:10:36.584]  So basically BuzzFeed put out this tweet with a big NOPE yellow sticker on it claiming that I had just made this all up.
[03:10:37.684 --> 03:10:39.545]  Now in fact they've changed their article since.
[03:10:40.566 --> 03:10:41.866]  And this is on my Twitter feed.
[03:10:42.006 --> 03:10:45.088]  If you go on my Twitter feed there's a tweet from Far Left Watch.
[03:10:46.509 --> 03:10:47.489]  There you see the original.
[03:10:47.569 --> 03:10:50.991]  If you go on the Twitter feed Prison Planet there's a tweet from Far Left Watch.
[03:10:51.579 --> 03:10:59.083]  And it says, check out the stealth edit BuzzFeed made after their wildly inaccurate claim about Muslim reactions to the Notre Dame fire was easily refuted.
[03:10:59.884 --> 03:11:03.786]  Perhaps they should change it to, there's zero evidence that BuzzFeed employs journalists.
[03:11:04.227 --> 03:11:11.511]  Because in the initial story they said, quote, there's zero evidence Muslims were responding to the Notre Dame fire with smiley faces.
[03:11:12.251 --> 03:11:15.093]  I completely debunked that and proved yes they were.
[03:11:15.493 --> 03:11:16.654]  So now they've changed it.
[03:11:17.788 --> 03:11:22.492]  To say far-right influencers are pushing an old narrative about smiley face reactions.
[03:11:23.573 --> 03:11:27.637]  And they've literally just excised out their entire argument.
[03:11:28.277 --> 03:11:35.123]  Now they're not denying, they're saying the video purports to show positive reactions to a video of Notre Dame burning.
[03:11:35.463 --> 03:11:40.407]  Remember before they said, oh this video has no source and we don't know what they're reacting to.
[03:11:40.968 --> 03:11:43.230]  So they've been proven complete liars on that point.
[03:11:44.156 --> 03:11:48.579]  And then it goes on to say, it basically says that, oh, emojis are meaningless.
[03:11:49.140 --> 03:11:53.543]  Because they could find some smiley emojis on the New Zealand mosque shooting videos.
[03:11:53.783 --> 03:11:56.085]  And if they could, that's also vile.
[03:11:56.785 --> 03:11:57.646]  This is the point here.
[03:11:57.746 --> 03:12:02.470]  Why are you running defence for vile people who are celebrating the Notre Dame fire?
[03:12:02.930 --> 03:12:06.973]  So at first they said there's no evidence this is a video of people reacting to the Notre Dame fire.
[03:12:07.313 --> 03:12:10.636]  Then they said, oh, even if it is, emojis don't mean anything.
[03:12:11.756 --> 03:12:12.257]  Alright then.
[03:12:13.439 --> 03:12:24.084]  So if emojis don't mean anything, let's look at the actual comments that people were making on France 24 Arabic's Facebook page while this building was burning.
[03:12:25.264 --> 03:12:26.525]  And this is in my video again.
[03:12:26.925 --> 03:12:30.847]  These comments are all translated from Arabic from France 24 Arabic's Facebook page.
[03:12:31.087 --> 03:12:35.189]  This is what people said in response to the horrific, tragic Notre Dame fire.
[03:12:35.289 --> 03:12:39.931]  Quote, I'm disappointed for the lack of charred bodies in this festive party.
[03:12:40.976 --> 03:12:43.418]  Quote, what a wonderful moment, God thank you.
[03:12:43.878 --> 03:12:47.061]  Quote, I dedicate this wonderful and beautiful fire to my family.
[03:12:47.101 --> 03:12:49.703]  Congratulations, hopefully, the mass destruction of France.
[03:12:50.303 --> 03:12:55.967]  Again, these are all from France 24, French TV News Network, Arabic's Facebook page.
[03:12:56.148 --> 03:12:57.008]  They're still there.
[03:12:57.489 --> 03:13:01.251]  These were collated from just two small sections of two threads.
[03:13:01.892 --> 03:13:04.234]  Anyone can go there right now and look at it for themselves.
[03:13:05.515 --> 03:13:07.616]  Another person said, it's a beautiful fire.
[03:13:07.776 --> 03:13:09.698]  Oh my God, the most beautiful fire in the world.
[03:13:10.600 --> 03:13:13.342]  We announce the sympathy of our full solidarity with the fire.
[03:13:13.622 --> 03:13:17.384]  Another person said, unfortunately the entire structure did not collapse.
[03:13:18.064 --> 03:13:19.085]  He was sad about that.
[03:13:20.346 --> 03:13:22.767]  Another person said, I am sympathetic to fire.
[03:13:23.848 --> 03:13:28.550]  Another person said, I dedicate this fire to all the Algerian people and we wish another fire.
[03:13:28.570 --> 03:13:32.573]  Another person said, God willing the next on the Eiffel Tower.
[03:13:33.033 --> 03:13:39.777]  Another person said, I am very happy, then literally put two smiley faces, which BuzzFeed says doesn't exist,
[03:13:40.603 --> 03:13:42.526]  to see a part of France burning.
[03:13:43.347 --> 03:13:44.188]  They see gifts.
[03:13:44.288 --> 03:13:45.409]  Yay, I'm so happy.
[03:13:46.010 --> 03:13:46.511]  Another one.
[03:13:46.711 --> 03:13:47.372]  Celebrate.
[03:13:47.792 --> 03:13:52.739]  These were all responses to the burning of the Notre Dame Cathedral live as it happened.
[03:13:53.420 --> 03:13:56.303]  Apparently, that never happened according to BuzzFeed.
[03:13:56.744 --> 03:13:58.346]  Okay, so emojis don't matter.
[03:13:58.386 --> 03:13:58.907]  Now they said,
[03:13:59.691 --> 03:14:03.114]  Oh, the video didn't show them reacting to the fire, now they have to admit it did.
[03:14:03.454 --> 03:14:04.875]  Oh, but emojis don't matter.
[03:14:04.895 --> 03:14:13.402]  Alright, what about dozens and dozens of comments of people, literally, in real time, celebrating the burning of this cathedral?
[03:14:14.663 --> 03:14:17.826]  Now remember, they tried to put out this hoax.
[03:14:18.601 --> 03:14:36.910]  Through Ryan Broderick and others on Twitter yesterday, literally calling for me and others to be deplatformed for putting out conspiracy theories and misinformation about the Notre Dame fire, when that's precisely what BuzzFeed did by claiming that nobody was celebrating the Notre Dame fire.
[03:14:37.570 --> 03:14:47.235]  I haven't even gotten to the comments of leftists, which are awash on Twitter with people literally unable to contain their glee, people on the left at this fire.
[03:14:49.770 --> 03:14:52.071]  So again, you're not going to change the conversation.
[03:14:52.091 --> 03:14:53.452]  You're not going to bury the conversation.
[03:14:53.492 --> 03:14:54.693]  This is a massive problem.
[03:14:55.473 --> 03:14:59.295]  Am I saying that all Muslims are up in arms celebrating the Notre Dame fire?
[03:14:59.335 --> 03:14:59.455]  No.
[03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:04.463]  Am I saying that BuzzFeed lied when they said some Muslims weren't?
[03:15:04.683 --> 03:15:05.884]  Yes, they're lying.
[03:15:06.224 --> 03:15:07.145]  Why are they lying?
[03:15:07.605 --> 03:15:18.913]  Because again, they can create this idea that this is a conspiracy theory and people who put out conspiracy theories and fake news need to be banned by social media networks, so we should be banned.
[03:15:19.473 --> 03:15:24.357]  Even when it's BuzzFeed who is literally putting out this fake news story.
[03:15:24.897 --> 03:15:25.838]  And now it's in like
[03:15:26.824 --> 03:15:36.555]  A dozen other news outlets just today this same hoax replicated even though at its very source they put out the hoax.
[03:15:37.416 --> 03:15:44.945]  In fact Politico put out a newsletter today that said poor Joseph Watson shared a hoax claiming Muslims were reacting positively to the fire.
[03:15:45.623 --> 03:15:48.745]  No, you shared a hoax because that story was true.
[03:15:49.146 --> 03:15:54.610]  You denying the reality of something which is manifestly provable is you putting out a hoax.
[03:15:54.970 --> 03:16:00.574]  So if people should be banned on social media for putting out hoaxes, Politico and BuzzFeed should be banned.
[03:16:00.874 --> 03:16:02.015]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[03:16:02.416 --> 03:16:09.141]  Hi, I'm... I want to put forward an allegory or a story to explain
[03:16:10.489 --> 03:16:14.312]  Where I'm coming from that parallels current real-time reality.
[03:16:14.752 --> 03:16:17.274]  So please, bear with me a few minutes.
[03:16:18.755 --> 03:16:21.737]  Because this is just bubbling up from my own thought processes.
[03:16:22.977 --> 03:16:24.518]  Of why am I sitting here with my shirt off?
[03:16:25.379 --> 03:16:27.400]  I want to be crystal clear with everybody.
[03:16:29.141 --> 03:16:35.566]  What I'm about to say is not about putting down California like we're different football teams.
[03:16:36.927 --> 03:16:39.989]  And we're talking about the University of Texas versus UCLA.
[03:16:41.499 --> 03:16:45.821]  This is not... Alex Jones is a tribalist going, woo!
[03:16:46.262 --> 03:16:48.042]  Texas is way better than California.
[03:16:48.263 --> 03:16:49.023]  F-California.
[03:16:50.464 --> 03:16:54.866]  California, until about 30 years ago, was undoubtedly the best state in the Union.
[03:16:56.067 --> 03:17:00.529]  It was more Texan than Texans because it was the last big frontier state.
[03:17:01.169 --> 03:17:02.710]  The 49ers, all of it.
[03:17:02.770 --> 03:17:05.932]  I mean, the history books I've read about it have been incredible.
[03:17:07.344 --> 03:17:11.586]  It was deep red until just about 25 years ago.
[03:17:13.406 --> 03:17:23.230]  The Democrats came in, they opened the borders, they engineered the state, they created socialism, dependency, and now the state is a skeleton of its former self.
[03:17:24.530 --> 03:17:31.073]  And now Beto and others have set their sights to turn Texas blue, and most political experts agree by 20
[03:17:32.939 --> 03:17:35.981]  24, Texas will be deep blue.
[03:17:36.901 --> 03:17:38.502]  My fellow Texans are in a coma.
[03:17:38.983 --> 03:17:46.147]  But as Kennedy said, and as Eisenhower said, and as Nixon said, and as Reagan said, as goes Texas, so goes the nation.
[03:17:46.367 --> 03:17:49.188]  It's been like that since the Civil War.
[03:17:50.629 --> 03:17:51.490]  That's a whole other history book.
[03:17:52.550 --> 03:18:00.755]  And so the fall of California, and it's a big gaping hole in our defenses for the collapse of Latin America, it's not a positive thing.
[03:18:02.432 --> 03:18:03.793]  It's not something I celebrate.
[03:18:03.813 --> 03:18:05.335]  It's like whistling past the graveyard.
[03:18:05.415 --> 03:18:16.545]  But, the carpetbaggers from all over the country that went to California, because it was the best state 30 years ago, who aren't Californians, they ruined that incredible state.
[03:18:17.346 --> 03:18:19.388]  They destroyed that incredible state.
[03:18:20.885 --> 03:18:29.631]  And now like locusts, or piranhas, or Nazi U-boat wolf packs, they have come to Texas to ruin our state.
[03:18:30.071 --> 03:18:47.504]  We have 10 different amazing t-shirts at InfoWarsTore.com, like this Don't California by USA flag t-shirt at InfoWarsTore.com that are great attention grabbers and conversation starters no matter where you live.
[03:18:48.624 --> 03:18:57.266]  In the country, because if the Democrats can take down Texas and Florida, it's over, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:58.530 --> 03:19:03.074]  The globalists want InfoWars shut down because they can track back.
[03:19:03.174 --> 03:19:05.096]  Almost all their defeats are to what we do.
[03:19:05.796 --> 03:19:08.659]  I instinctively know how to defeat them, just like you do.
[03:19:08.939 --> 03:19:09.900]  Probably resonate together.
[03:19:10.560 --> 03:19:13.543]  And I'm telling you, this don't California, my USA.
[03:19:13.903 --> 03:19:16.566]  This don't California, my Texas is the answer.
[03:19:16.806 --> 03:19:18.047]  The people have to be warned.
[03:19:18.607 --> 03:19:22.991]  We have 10 different limited edition shirts at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:19:23.472 --> 03:19:25.753]  Right now for men and women in all the sizes.
[03:19:26.454 --> 03:19:28.275]  And I want this to be a major movement.
[03:19:29.215 --> 03:19:33.156]  And so, for the next week or so, while supplies last, 50% off.
[03:19:33.176 --> 03:19:37.658]  That means I'm making 5 bucks on these shirts that funds the InfoWars.
[03:19:38.078 --> 03:19:44.320]  So spread the word, meet like-minded people, cause a debate, become a billboard for liberty and freedom today.
[03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:50.262]  InfoWarsStore.com and look at the 10 limited edition
[03:19:51.365 --> 03:19:52.887]  Don't California my USA.
[03:19:52.907 --> 03:19:53.968]  Don't California Texas.
[03:19:54.508 --> 03:19:56.370]  I welcome folks to say don't California Florida.
[03:19:56.610 --> 03:19:59.093]  Let's just get this going nationwide and let's win again.
[03:19:59.413 --> 03:20:00.815]  We can do it if we take action.
[03:20:00.995 --> 03:20:02.216]  We can save America.
[03:20:06.801 --> 03:20:09.484]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.916 --> 03:20:26.479]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.979 --> 03:20:30.800]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:33.381 --> 03:20:40.764]  So basically, what happened... I'm trying to summarize this in a tweet right now as we speak.
[03:20:42.089 --> 03:20:47.311]  I came out and said, point to the evidence, there were people reacting with smiley faces to the Notre Dame fire.
[03:20:47.351 --> 03:20:49.832]  This is horrible, this is vile, these people should be condemned.
[03:20:50.572 --> 03:20:55.534]  BuzzFeed came back with a giant article claiming that that was a hoax.
[03:20:56.054 --> 03:21:02.837]  Even though it wasn't a hoax, I provided the source video, you can see it for yourself right now, people reacting with smiley faces to the Notre Dame fire.
[03:21:04.598 --> 03:21:11.000]  BuzzFeed, the next day, after I called them out on Twitter, said, oh, smiley faces don't matter.
[03:21:13.098 --> 03:21:16.999]  Okay, but you just said there was no evidence of smiley faces.
[03:21:17.060 --> 03:21:18.640]  Now you're admitting there are.
[03:21:18.840 --> 03:21:21.321]  There is evidence, but now you're saying smiley faces don't matter.
[03:21:21.341 --> 03:21:21.621]  Alright.
[03:21:22.161 --> 03:21:29.664]  How about dozens and dozens of comments of people on these Facebook pages celebrating it in real time?
[03:21:30.084 --> 03:21:31.145]  What are you going to say about that?
[03:21:31.165 --> 03:21:32.785]  Are you going to say that they're fake comments?
[03:21:33.266 --> 03:21:34.746]  That those comments don't matter?
[03:21:35.146 --> 03:21:37.047]  This is where we're at with the mainstream media.
[03:21:38.081 --> 03:21:43.024]  And again, it's not just that they smear you, defame you and lie about you.
[03:21:43.444 --> 03:21:49.747]  It's that they use this fake claim that I created a hoax to then call for me to be deplatformed.
[03:21:50.067 --> 03:21:57.171]  So then I don't even have the opportunity to defend myself when they next smear me on whatever the next issue is.
[03:21:58.972 --> 03:21:59.672]  It's also about
[03:22:01.064 --> 03:22:13.107]  The sheer blind panic and terror that these news organizations have, especially BuzzFeed, which of course has laid off dozens and dozens of staff over the past six months, about not controlling the news narrative.
[03:22:14.068 --> 03:22:30.212]  And you even saw that on Fox News yesterday with Cavuto and with Shep Smith, where in the case of Shep Smith, it was literally a French official who was there on the scene speculating whether it was arson or whether it was accidental, which at the time
[03:22:31.204 --> 03:22:44.731]  Even though they've quickly ruled it out now, was a perfectly reasonable thing to speculate, given that we've literally had 875 attacks on churches in France in the last year alone.
[03:22:44.751 --> 03:22:50.975]  Not just fires, but desecrations, beheadings of statues of Jesus Christ of the Virgin Mary.
[03:22:51.495 --> 03:22:55.497]  So yes, it's completely within the realm of respectable comment.
[03:22:56.351 --> 03:23:00.194]  To speculate whether this was arson, especially when it was happening, and nobody really knew.
[03:23:00.614 --> 03:23:01.174]  Nobody knew!
[03:23:01.194 --> 03:23:16.105]  So for him to shut him down, oh we don't want conspiracy theories, and then for the likes of Buzzfeed to put out the biggest conspiracy theory, which was that there were no people celebrating this, when there clearly were hundreds and hundreds.
[03:23:18.015 --> 03:23:28.023]  I was on that 24, France 24 Arabic Facebook page and in fact in the video I go on Al Jazeera's Facebook page and it's exactly the same in terms of smiley faces.
[03:23:28.984 --> 03:23:36.770]  Literally every other comment was people celebrating this fire and they say that's a fake news conspiracy theory.
[03:23:37.090 --> 03:23:43.795]  They say that that is the reason I should be deplatformed and they're doing it today with people like Glenn Beck.
[03:23:43.855 --> 03:23:45.416]  Obviously I'm not a big fan of Glenn Beck.
[03:23:45.837 --> 03:23:47.218]  This is a headline out of Newsweek.
[03:23:48.095 --> 03:23:50.357]  Glenn Beck compares Notre Dame Fire to 9-11.
[03:23:50.397 --> 03:23:51.958]  This is their World Trade Center moment.
[03:23:52.579 --> 03:23:56.382]  Obviously, it's nowhere near the horror of the World Trade Center because no one died.
[03:23:57.402 --> 03:24:06.509]  But in terms of a historical devastation, a historical desecration, yes, it was somewhat on a par, at least, you know, architecturally.
[03:24:07.610 --> 03:24:08.851]  Thankfully, nobody died.
[03:24:08.991 --> 03:24:11.193]  It's not on the same level of 9-11.
[03:24:11.573 --> 03:24:16.057]  But what Beck was trending for on Twitter earlier was his comment
[03:24:17.137 --> 03:24:19.919]  According to this article that the fire may have been intentional.
[03:24:21.760 --> 03:24:25.143]  And Beck said this, quote, if this was arson this is going to be bad.
[03:24:25.543 --> 03:24:27.965]  It might have just been started by a cigarette, we don't know.
[03:24:29.306 --> 03:24:32.548]  And bear in mind they did this to Cernovich yesterday as well on Buzzfeed.
[03:24:33.277 --> 03:24:33.997]  Same thing.
[03:24:34.598 --> 03:24:40.000]  Cernovich literally did two videos where he straight off the bat said, yeah, looks like an accident.
[03:24:40.080 --> 03:24:41.061]  It's probably an accident.
[03:24:41.461 --> 03:24:47.264]  Oh, by the way, this is also a good time to talk about these 875 French churches that have been attacked.
[03:24:47.564 --> 03:24:48.724]  But this is an accident.
[03:24:49.805 --> 03:24:52.986]  And immediately that turned into, oh, Cernovich says it's not an accident.
[03:24:53.087 --> 03:24:57.128]  And now Russian media is picking up what Cernovich said.
[03:24:57.208 --> 03:24:58.049]  Everybody panic.
[03:24:58.149 --> 03:24:59.770]  My Russian conspiracy theory.
[03:25:00.310 --> 03:25:02.091]  They're still running with that hoax.
[03:25:03.988 --> 03:25:11.718]  So Beck comes out and says it might have just been started by a cigarette, but if this was started by Islamists, I don't think you'll find out about it.
[03:25:11.938 --> 03:25:14.221]  Because I think it would set the entire country on fire.
[03:25:14.601 --> 03:25:18.065]  They've had killings, they've had mass shootings, they've had people running down people in the streets.
[03:25:18.426 --> 03:25:19.527]  The tension is very high.
[03:25:20.148 --> 03:25:23.412]  And that, again, is a completely fair comment to make.
[03:25:24.150 --> 03:25:45.117]  We've done stories on Infowars about military heads, security officials in France, ex-Ministers of the Interior saying, look, if this gets much worse in terms of the lack of integration of some of these communities and in terms of these terror attacks, these attacks on police, you had the priest back in, what was it, 2017 being beheaded.
[03:25:45.577 --> 03:25:48.058]  Dozens and dozens of Islamic terror attacks in France.
[03:25:48.658 --> 03:25:51.239]  They've said this could spill over into some kind of civil war.
[03:25:52.017 --> 03:25:53.598]  This is not Glenn Beck saying it.
[03:25:53.638 --> 03:25:59.319]  This is officials within the French security apparatus within the French military saying this.
[03:25:59.819 --> 03:26:09.763]  So would there be an agenda for them to hide an Islamist connection to something as devastating and horrific as the Notre Dame Cathedral burning down?
[03:26:10.963 --> 03:26:11.363]  I don't know.
[03:26:11.543 --> 03:26:12.583]  It probably was an accident.
[03:26:12.623 --> 03:26:17.245]  But even to ask the question, it's a perfectly reasonable question to ask.
[03:26:17.605 --> 03:26:20.466]  It's not within the realms of wild conspiracy theory.
[03:26:21.181 --> 03:26:24.885]  But again, he's being completely torn apart just for asking the question.
[03:26:25.946 --> 03:26:34.575]  Once again, they don't want anybody asking any questions which challenge any of their narratives, even if it's far from the realms of wild conspiracy theory.
[03:26:36.056 --> 03:26:44.065]  I mean, YouTube is so freaked out at this point about tamping down on conspiracy theories that they literally put up a Wikipedia fact check box
[03:26:45.217 --> 03:26:50.342]  On videos of the Notre Dame fire yesterday because their stupid algorithm didn't even know what was going on.
[03:26:50.362 --> 03:26:51.403]  It was like, oh panic!
[03:26:52.043 --> 03:26:54.706]  Somebody might say something against the official narrative.
[03:26:54.726 --> 03:26:57.008]  We better clamp down on this immediately.
[03:26:57.028 --> 03:27:04.094]  The other aspect to this, and that's in the CNN article, the internet is already awash in Notre Dame conspiracies.
[03:27:04.855 --> 03:27:08.358]  There were a lot of dumb conspiracies which were obviously not true.
[03:27:09.688 --> 03:27:15.993]  Like, oh, there's some guy milling around with Muslim garb as the fire's burning in the building.
[03:27:16.073 --> 03:27:16.954]  No, wasn't true.
[03:27:17.054 --> 03:27:17.755]  It was a fireman.
[03:27:18.455 --> 03:27:28.324]  There were fake Fox News accounts, fake CNN accounts that were set up on Twitter that put out deliberate fake news that this was an ISIS or an Islamic terror attack.
[03:27:28.764 --> 03:27:32.227]  Yes, pure conspiracy theory, pure BS.
[03:27:32.787 --> 03:27:36.831]  Then you had BuzzFeed patting themselves on the back because they got those accounts shut down.
[03:27:37.501 --> 03:27:39.082]  And yes, that was complete BS.
[03:27:39.102 --> 03:27:40.483]  That was pure conspiracy theory.
[03:27:40.723 --> 03:27:55.633]  But then they link it in, they tie it all together with stuff which is actually true, like the fact that there were people celebrating this fire in real time as it happened, and basically say, oh, well, all these other conspiracies are BS.
[03:27:55.653 --> 03:27:56.494]  They've been debunked.
[03:27:56.774 --> 03:27:57.775]  They've been shut down.
[03:27:58.095 --> 03:27:58.935]  Why not this one?
[03:27:59.015 --> 03:28:00.056]  Well, because it's true.
[03:28:01.457 --> 03:28:04.939]  And you were the ones who put out the fake news story that it wasn't.
[03:28:05.980 --> 03:28:07.181]  So Glenn Beck is being
[03:28:07.975 --> 03:28:09.256]  Completely pillared for that.
[03:28:09.316 --> 03:28:21.504]  Again, anyone who dares bring up the fact that there have been 875 attacks on French churches over the past year alone, they're being called conspiracy theorists now.
[03:28:22.565 --> 03:28:29.430]  Anti-Christian attacks in France, we did a story on this yesterday, before the fire, coincidentally enough, on Summit.News.
[03:28:30.254 --> 03:28:35.977]  Anti-Christian attacks in France are running 10 to 1 against anti-Muslim attacks.
[03:28:36.537 --> 03:28:39.919]  So there were around 1,000 anti-Christian attacks in 2018 in France.
[03:28:40.399 --> 03:28:41.840]  Attacks on churches, etc.
[03:28:42.500 --> 03:28:44.821]  And only 100 anti-Muslim attacks.
[03:28:44.921 --> 03:28:46.962]  And all attacks are horrible, all should be condemned.
[03:28:47.526 --> 03:28:49.148]  But again, this is a big problem.
[03:28:49.529 --> 03:28:51.772]  Jews are fleeing France in record numbers.
[03:28:52.273 --> 03:28:58.982]  These hate crimes are actually a big problem in France, and we can't deny that by claiming it's all one big conspiracy theory.
[03:28:59.343 --> 03:29:00.645]  We'll be back, Infowars.com.
[03:29:02.455 --> 03:29:05.278]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified.
[03:29:05.298 --> 03:29:06.619]  1776 will come next again if you try to take off firearms!
[03:29:06.639 --> 03:29:07.199]  That man is Alex Jones.
[03:29:07.239 --> 03:29:09.061]  He's one of those guys who believes that Bigfoot was responsible for 9-11.
[03:29:09.081 --> 03:29:10.102]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true!
[03:29:10.122 --> 03:29:10.322]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:10.442 --> 03:29:10.863]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:10.883 --> 03:29:11.083]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:11.103 --> 03:29:11.403]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:11.443 --> 03:29:11.723]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:11.743 --> 03:29:11.964]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:11.984 --> 03:29:12.204]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:12.224 --> 03:29:12.484]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:12.504 --> 03:29:12.704]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:12.724 --> 03:29:13.085]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:13.105 --> 03:29:13.345]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:13.365 --> 03:29:13.785]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:13.825 --> 03:29:14.166]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:14.186 --> 03:29:14.406]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:14.426 --> 03:29:14.686]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:14.846 --> 03:29:15.167]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:15.207 --> 03:29:15.447]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:15.527 --> 03:29:16.107]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:16.127 --> 03:29:16.428]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:16.448 --> 03:29:16.648]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:16.668 --> 03:29:16.908]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:16.928 --> 03:29:17.228]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:17.288 --> 03:29:17.789]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:17.909 --> 03:29:18.610]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:18.850 --> 03:29:19.330]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:19.350 --> 03:29:19.570]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:19.590 --> 03:29:19.791]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:19.811 --> 03:29:20.431]  Alex Jones.
[03:29:20.591 --> 03:29:21.132]  Alex Jones.

[03:29:51.172 --> 03:29:51.813]  InfoWars.
[03:29:51.873 --> 03:29:53.494]  What's happened with InfoWars?
[03:29:53.614 --> 03:29:57.075]  I would love it if you would follow up also about Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:29:57.195 --> 03:30:01.237]  Alex Jones obviously is a well-known conspiracy theorist whose brand is bullying.
[03:30:01.337 --> 03:30:02.858]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[03:30:02.878 --> 03:30:04.379]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[03:30:04.819 --> 03:30:07.160]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[03:30:07.280 --> 03:30:12.202]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories.
[03:30:12.363 --> 03:30:17.485]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[03:30:17.605 --> 03:30:21.250]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment.
[03:30:21.331 --> 03:30:24.275]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[03:30:24.415 --> 03:30:31.806]  Yesterday, Apple, iTunes, Vimeo, and Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:30:31.866 --> 03:30:32.787]  Who is the most
[03:30:33.268 --> 03:30:35.109]  The most banned news network in the world.
[03:30:35.189 --> 03:30:36.229]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:38.990]  Alex Jones, which has now been taken off Facebook, thank God.
[03:30:39.030 --> 03:30:41.651]  CNN waged a long campaign against Jones.
[03:30:41.771 --> 03:30:42.271]  It worked.
[03:30:42.811 --> 03:30:45.592]  Jeff Zucker silenced and de-platformed his show.
[03:30:45.792 --> 03:30:48.173]  It was a stunning defeat for free speech.
[03:30:48.413 --> 03:30:53.334]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[03:30:55.975 --> 03:30:59.296]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in existence.
[03:31:08.431 --> 03:31:11.193]  And let's go to Lukas in North Carolina.
[03:31:11.213 --> 03:31:12.073]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:31:12.293 --> 03:31:12.873]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:31:12.893 --> 03:31:13.434]  Good to be on.
[03:31:13.474 --> 03:31:14.214]  Good to have you here.
[03:31:14.474 --> 03:31:18.677]  Real quickly, I just wanted to say that I am a user of InfoWars products.
[03:31:18.917 --> 03:31:21.198]  First, I started with Supermail Vitality.
[03:31:21.218 --> 03:31:28.682]  I am a late-30s male, and I don't get all the time that I would like to work out as much as I do, and immediately noticed that
[03:31:29.162 --> 03:31:34.668]  Being able to retain strength and muscle mass from the use of super male vitality, so I want to thank you for that.
[03:31:34.808 --> 03:31:40.834]  Also, I bought the t-shirt, Reelect45, and the Hillary for Prison, obviously, one of the most popular.
[03:31:40.854 --> 03:31:45.939]  It's drawn so much attention, and I don't know if people believe it or not, but it's all positive attention.
[03:31:45.959 --> 03:31:52.386]  The main reaction that I got myself was from males 18 to 20 years old and middle-aged black women.
[03:31:52.526 --> 03:31:55.987]  Honestly, God, they were the ones commenting saying, I love that shirt.
[03:31:56.027 --> 03:31:58.548]  They would laugh about it, tell their friends about it.
[03:31:58.688 --> 03:32:10.331]  And, uh, next I tried X2 and, uh, it's nothing that you notice immediately, but it seemed over time, I felt like I was more sharp from the iodine, being able to retain short-term memory better.
[03:32:10.371 --> 03:32:13.472]  I just feel a little sharper in my day-to-day activities.
[03:32:13.732 --> 03:32:15.973]  I totally agree with you.
[03:32:16.113 --> 03:32:17.274]  It's the good halogen.
[03:32:17.454 --> 03:32:21.497]  IQs get reduced by 15 points without iodine in your development.
[03:32:21.517 --> 03:32:22.597]  People can look this up for themselves.
[03:32:23.057 --> 03:32:27.360]  And that's why the globalists are obsessed with making sure it's not in the food, it's not in the products we eat.
[03:32:27.760 --> 03:32:29.321]  We are just starving for iodine.
[03:32:29.341 --> 03:32:30.382]  That's why we came out with X2.
[03:32:30.422 --> 03:32:32.363]  We have X3 that's all three types.
[03:32:32.403 --> 03:32:33.724]  This is the Deep Earth Crystal Source.
[03:32:33.784 --> 03:32:35.044]  We don't have it back in stock.
[03:32:35.124 --> 03:32:37.226]  So again, InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:37.406 --> 03:32:39.607]  InfoWarsLife.com takes you right to the sub page.
[03:32:39.687 --> 03:32:41.469]  That has all the award-winning supplements.

[03:33:31.254 --> 03:33:40.096]  Before I get into some more of this news, I want to tell you about a couple of the great deals available right now at InfoWarsStore.com, which of course funds this network.
[03:33:40.576 --> 03:33:52.239]  In the fight against real fake news, which is what BuzzFeed puts out on a regular basis, we have 50% off all apparel right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:52.279 --> 03:33:54.499]  You can get some absolutely great products.
[03:33:55.159 --> 03:33:58.480]  The Build the Wall t-shirt, the InfoWars hexagon polo shirt,
[03:33:59.196 --> 03:34:01.257]  Reviews are now coming in for these products.
[03:34:01.317 --> 03:34:03.878]  Again, five-star across the board.
[03:34:05.439 --> 03:34:08.741]  InfoWars Tank Man, another great t-shirt that we've got out there.
[03:34:09.741 --> 03:34:10.962]  And many, many more.
[03:34:10.982 --> 03:34:14.824]  The Trump Medusa t-shirt as well, another great iconic meme.
[03:34:15.504 --> 03:34:20.747]  You've got caps, you've got decal stickers, you've got hats, woolen hats, everything you could want.
[03:34:21.447 --> 03:34:25.989]  In terms of apparel, right now at infowarsstore.com, 50% off.

[03:34:31.435 --> 03:34:36.426]  Well, we also have two weeks, sorry, let me see here.
[03:34:37.225 --> 03:34:38.086]  Two-week food supply, $67.
[03:34:38.386 --> 03:34:41.428]  That is an absolute steal.
[03:34:42.048 --> 03:34:47.732]  They do this storable food in EU countries where I live, and it's prohibitively expensive.
[03:34:48.092 --> 03:34:51.294]  You might as well buy it in a regular grocery store.
[03:34:51.894 --> 03:34:53.275]  This is an absolute steal.
[03:34:53.675 --> 03:35:02.461]  You can get InfoWars Live Select two-week supply of emergency survival food, which includes a whopping 92 servings for 1,500 plus calories a day.
[03:35:06.460 --> 03:35:20.634]  And that is limited to four per purchase because it's flying off the shelves at this low, low price of $67 for InfoWars Life Select two week storable food just to make sure you have something in reserve.
[03:35:20.654 --> 03:35:22.957]  You know, FEMA, the federal government stores food.
[03:35:23.017 --> 03:35:24.919]  Everybody does it in terms of government.
[03:35:25.059 --> 03:35:27.121]  When we do it, they say we're kooks.
[03:35:28.365 --> 03:35:31.866]  But again, if nothing happens, you just eat the food and save money anyway.
[03:35:31.886 --> 03:35:38.368]  It's a win-win, and at the low price of $67, that is a massive, massive, massive discount available right now.
[03:35:38.448 --> 03:35:42.089]  InfoWars Live Select, two-week supply, 92 servings.
[03:35:42.930 --> 03:35:47.551]  InfoWarsStore.com, 131 reviews, the vast majority five-star.
[03:35:47.571 --> 03:35:49.251]  You see there, 4.8 out of 5.
[03:35:49.752 --> 03:35:51.992]  Select the auto-ship option as well.
[03:35:52.733 --> 03:35:54.873]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:35:56.674 --> 03:35:57.254]  Now, the last
[03:35:58.294 --> 03:36:07.637]  Little tidbit of this BuzzFeed hit piece was they claimed that InfoWars put out a baseless claim that the fire was set deliberately.
[03:36:08.738 --> 03:36:10.538]  No, that wasn't put out by me.
[03:36:10.838 --> 03:36:14.680]  That was put out by somebody who worked for the mainstream media.
[03:36:16.200 --> 03:36:20.622]  So this was a guy called Christopher Hale, who was a Time magazine journalist.
[03:36:21.388 --> 03:36:29.494]  Who tweeted that he knew an employee who worked at the Notre Dame Cathedral who said that it was deliberately set.
[03:36:29.874 --> 03:36:31.475]  It's not Alex Jones that said that.
[03:36:31.916 --> 03:36:33.617]  It's not PJW that said that.
[03:36:33.877 --> 03:36:36.639]  It was one of your own mainstream media journalists.
[03:36:37.219 --> 03:36:40.642]  Now as soon as this started getting attention, he deleted the tweet.
[03:36:43.244 --> 03:36:44.004]  Pretty cowardly.
[03:36:44.364 --> 03:36:46.466]  I managed to screenshot it before he deleted it.
[03:36:46.486 --> 03:36:47.767]  Wrote up an article saying
[03:36:48.467 --> 03:36:51.089]  This guy who works for Time Magazine has a friend who works there.
[03:36:51.129 --> 03:36:52.470]  He says it was set deliberately.
[03:36:52.490 --> 03:36:54.091]  He didn't say it was set deliberately.
[03:36:54.111 --> 03:36:57.493]  He said this guy claims it was set deliberately.
[03:36:57.853 --> 03:36:58.713]  Was that true?
[03:36:59.514 --> 03:37:04.857]  That this individual who worked at the Notre Dame, according to this Time Magazine journalist, said it was set deliberately?
[03:37:05.217 --> 03:37:09.180]  Well, according to your own Time Magazine journalist, yes, it was true.
[03:37:10.180 --> 03:37:17.405]  So then they claim that we're spreading that baseless theory because he got freaked out by the attention and deleted his tweet.
[03:37:18.010 --> 03:37:23.773]  And then they went back and interviewed him and said, he basically said, Oh, for the record, I completely believe it was an accident.
[03:37:23.793 --> 03:37:26.074]  Alright, why did you tweet that then?
[03:37:26.734 --> 03:37:29.215]  I was writing an article based on his tweet.
[03:37:29.295 --> 03:37:30.096]  That's your guy.
[03:37:30.156 --> 03:37:31.536]  He works for the mainstream media.
[03:37:31.716 --> 03:37:33.677]  That's not us circulating fake news.
[03:37:34.057 --> 03:37:36.679]  If he knew it was fake news, that was him circulating it.
[03:37:37.599 --> 03:37:38.559]  He deleted the tweet.
[03:37:38.880 --> 03:37:42.101]  Again, extremely, extremely weak.
[03:37:43.302 --> 03:37:45.943]  Meanwhile, Sputnik reports,
[03:37:46.644 --> 03:37:51.205]  Pakistani migrant facing jail time over damage to ancient French basilica.
[03:37:52.185 --> 03:37:53.465]  Oh, we can't talk about this though.
[03:37:53.485 --> 03:37:55.305]  I guess this is a conspiracy theory now too.
[03:37:56.286 --> 03:38:02.847]  The 875 churches have been desecrated in France over the past year, according to official government numbers.
[03:38:03.467 --> 03:38:09.228]  France has suffered a stark uptick in vandalism against places of Christian worship in recent years.
[03:38:09.648 --> 03:38:15.849]  Close to 900 acts of defacement and well over 100 thefts of church artifacts reported over the last year alone.
[03:38:16.630 --> 03:38:28.492]  41-year-old Pakistani national charged with causing extensive damage to the Basilica of Saint Denis, which is where 400,000 illegal migrants live, 40% of them Muslim.
[03:38:28.932 --> 03:38:34.473]  One of France's most important religious, cultural, historical and architectural landmarks will go on trial next month.
[03:38:34.953 --> 03:38:35.333]  Or will he?
[03:38:35.393 --> 03:38:36.674]  Is it just a conspiracy theory?
[03:38:36.714 --> 03:38:38.014]  Maybe BuzzFeed can debunk it.
[03:38:38.814 --> 03:38:44.675]  The man who arrived in France just two months ago, again, very well integrated individual by the sounds of it,
[03:38:45.350 --> 03:38:53.395]  ...is accused of damaging two doors and several stained glass windows and causing extensive damage to the Basilica's main organ back in March.
[03:38:54.376 --> 03:39:00.620]  Remember, there was the fire at the other Saint Sulpice Church, I think it was a couple of months ago as well, in Paris.
[03:39:00.680 --> 03:39:03.402]  That got barely any media attention, as did this.
[03:39:04.202 --> 03:39:08.325]  He was arrested last week after his DNA was reportedly discovered at the scene of the crime.
[03:39:09.446 --> 03:39:10.867]  So this guy's gonna be on, uh,
[03:39:12.074 --> 03:39:13.615]  Trial here shortly.
[03:39:13.795 --> 03:39:19.717]  I guess that may not be happening because it's a conspiracy theory that we've all invented in our minds, according to BuzzFeed.
[03:39:21.278 --> 03:39:30.141]  The Sun reports churches across France have been set on fire and poo smeared on walls as the country's Christian heritage is said to be under attack from militant secularism.
[03:39:30.961 --> 03:39:31.681]  Again, that's the point.
[03:39:33.482 --> 03:39:37.124]  You'll notice in the original tweet, I didn't even say that Muslims were celebrating it.
[03:39:37.184 --> 03:39:38.164]  I said people.
[03:39:39.036 --> 03:39:44.500]  Some of these attacks are from Satanists, some of them are from extreme atheists, and some of them are from Muslims.
[03:39:44.580 --> 03:39:45.220]  It's a mix.
[03:39:45.981 --> 03:39:49.323]  Doesn't matter who's doing it, it's a real big problem.
[03:39:50.844 --> 03:39:55.587]  Daily Mail reports, So I guess, according to BuzzFeed, that doesn't matter.
[03:39:55.627 --> 03:39:56.708]  Maybe ISIS doesn't exist, I don't know.
[03:40:09.770 --> 03:40:14.011]  So again, you have this narrative of ISIS reacting to it, ISIS celebrating it.
[03:40:14.671 --> 03:40:24.473]  Unless ISIS is running every other comment through the France 24 Arabic Facebook page, I mean, God hope they're not, otherwise ISIS is far larger than we expected.
[03:40:24.913 --> 03:40:27.954]  Because the comments were quite similar.
[03:40:28.594 --> 03:40:36.956]  ISIS fanatics are heartlessly reveling in the inferno at Notre Dame Cathedral just days after Easter, calling it retribution and punishment according to terror intelligence researchers.
[03:40:38.143 --> 03:40:42.724]  I guess BuzzFeed's gonna have to debunk them as well and say that they're lying and putting out fake news even though they're not.
[03:40:43.284 --> 03:40:47.105]  The poster of the blazing cathedral appeared online accompanied by the words, have a good day.
[03:40:47.865 --> 03:40:48.805]  But did it really?
[03:40:49.005 --> 03:40:53.846]  Does that poster from this article really show the Notre Dame Cathedral?
[03:40:53.986 --> 03:41:06.609]  Maybe we need BuzzFeed to take a look at this because apparently they can't recognise what the cathedral looks like but still put out fake news stories claiming that I don't know what it looks like when it's right there in the background.
[03:41:09.210 --> 03:41:13.833]  Meanwhile, Baptist Pastor Says Bank of America shut down all of his church's bank accounts.
[03:41:14.574 --> 03:41:20.018]  We've seen that in the past with people like Joe Biggs, I think, who temporarily got his account shut down.
[03:41:20.458 --> 03:41:27.463]  We've seen it with Enrique Tarillo, the Proud Boys member, who got his Chase Bank account shut down.
[03:41:28.263 --> 03:41:34.908]  And now we have Pastor Steven Anderson of the Faithful Will Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona.
[03:41:35.609 --> 03:41:35.929]  And again,
[03:41:37.222 --> 03:41:48.345]  This guy says a lot of stuff which is absolutely insane and I'm not going to defend what he says about specific issues, but if you're going to defend free speech, you're going to have to defend unpopular free speech.
[03:41:48.725 --> 03:41:55.626]  You can't withdraw people's ability to engage in basic e-commerce just because you don't like what they said.
[03:41:56.867 --> 03:41:59.967]  Because that is a slippery slope to absolute oblivion.
[03:42:01.068 --> 03:42:01.868]  So they've had their
[03:42:02.887 --> 03:42:05.689]  I said, Chase, it was actually Bank of America account shutdown.
[03:42:06.009 --> 03:42:07.531]  Why not just start your own bank?
[03:42:08.211 --> 03:42:10.133]  I mean, that's what people on the right say.
[03:42:10.213 --> 03:42:12.374]  Some of them worship my free market.
[03:42:12.955 --> 03:42:15.416]  Oh, we can't have any regulation of social media.
[03:42:15.437 --> 03:42:18.139]  We can't have any regulation of commerce.
[03:42:18.179 --> 03:42:19.339]  Just start your own bank.
[03:42:20.020 --> 03:42:21.361]  Just start your own Twitter.
[03:42:22.902 --> 03:42:24.784]  That's what their reaction will be to that.
[03:42:25.864 --> 03:42:30.488]  Again, people are continuing to react to the Notre Dame Cathedral fire.
[03:42:31.621 --> 03:42:32.761]  We have this story as well.
[03:42:32.901 --> 03:42:37.183]  ISIS bride leftist went back in the UK, stitched explosives into suicide vests.
[03:42:37.663 --> 03:42:45.305]  So this is Begum, this Shemima Begum, this ISIS bride, literally saw decapitated heads in bins and said she wasn't fazed by it.
[03:42:45.705 --> 03:42:47.906]  Stitched explosives into suicide vests.
[03:42:48.186 --> 03:42:50.047]  Was a brutal ISIS controller.
[03:42:50.587 --> 03:42:53.668]  Now she wants back into the country and the left supports it.
[03:42:53.708 --> 03:42:56.349]  Now she's got legal aid and it looks like it could happen.
[03:42:56.509 --> 03:42:57.649]  Absolutely absurd.
[03:42:58.029 --> 03:42:59.330]  This is the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:42:59.450 --> 03:43:00.250]  InfoWars.com.
[03:43:00.270 --> 03:43:00.730]  We'll be back.
[03:43:04.625 --> 03:43:05.646]  Samuel, thanks for calling.
[03:43:05.846 --> 03:43:07.366]  Alex, it's a pleasure to talk to you.
[03:43:07.427 --> 03:43:07.787]  Hello.
[03:43:07.947 --> 03:43:12.849]  Alex, if I can just quickly, InfoWarsStore.com, I want to thank you for Polnblock.
[03:43:13.069 --> 03:43:13.690]  It's amazing.
[03:43:13.810 --> 03:43:18.092]  I've used so many different antihistamines over the years because I get really bad hay fever.
[03:43:18.292 --> 03:43:19.553]  And the antihistamines
[03:43:19.953 --> 03:43:23.918]  Sometimes work, sometimes don't, but they never quite work fully.
[03:43:23.938 --> 03:43:28.923]  They don't block all of the symptoms, they just kind of dry you up, or at least that's what they do for me, if they work at all.
[03:43:28.983 --> 03:43:30.485]  But pollen block, it works.
[03:43:30.665 --> 03:43:31.626]  It stops everything.
[03:43:31.746 --> 03:43:35.791]  I don't get the itchy eyes, I'm not sneezing, and I don't get the irritation.
[03:43:35.931 --> 03:43:36.652]  It is amazing.
[03:43:36.732 --> 03:43:38.993]  This is a known patent out of France.
[03:43:39.013 --> 03:43:40.453]  You have to pay for the patent.
[03:43:40.813 --> 03:43:49.696]  Where they just discovered that if you feed a certain secret diet to quail, and then you get their eggs, it creates this incredible antihistamine of a certain type of quail.
[03:43:49.836 --> 03:43:52.217]  How fast did it take for pollen block to kick in for you?
[03:43:52.737 --> 03:43:55.840]  It's pretty much straight away, you know, in maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes.
[03:43:56.100 --> 03:43:56.720]  It just works.
[03:43:56.740 --> 03:44:07.429]  The antihistamines, the pharmaceutical products, I find that with those, I can't take them until I start getting symptoms, and even then, they might not kick in for half an hour, or they might not kick in at all, depending on the day.
[03:44:07.449 --> 03:44:09.991]  Polonblock works every single time.
[03:44:10.111 --> 03:44:11.232]  Well, that's the great part about this.
[03:44:11.312 --> 03:44:14.695]  And for whatever reason, France discovered it like 50 years ago.
[03:44:14.855 --> 03:44:17.137]  It's still got to be even in this region of France.
[03:44:17.217 --> 03:44:18.038]  It's very complex.
[03:44:18.078 --> 03:44:18.879]  They don't even know why.
[03:44:18.939 --> 03:44:22.222]  But they think it's the pollen in the area, the dust, what the quail are eating.
[03:44:22.822 --> 03:44:29.448]  Then they just produce in the eggs whatever this essence is that just turns the histamine response off.
[03:44:29.609 --> 03:44:31.310]  I go out and I do market research.
[03:44:31.490 --> 03:44:33.912]  And I say, what are the best-selling products in the world?
[03:44:34.073 --> 03:44:35.474]  And what have the best reviews in the world?
[03:44:35.734 --> 03:44:43.896]  And then what do people in America not know that in Japan, or in Europe, or in Russia, or in Africa, or in Latin America, is already a bestseller?
[03:44:43.916 --> 03:44:45.536]  Because a lot of stuff never gets here for some reason.
[03:44:45.616 --> 03:44:50.838]  And in Europe, and in Russia, and in Canada, there are a lot of brands of this stuff with the quail eggs.
[03:44:51.378 --> 03:44:51.918]  It's not here.
[03:44:52.338 --> 03:44:55.779]  So we just made a souped-up version of it, discounted it, and it's Palm Block.
[03:44:55.839 --> 03:44:57.199]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139er.
[03:45:04.400 --> 03:45:12.185]  Hey, what happens if you try to order your favorite InfoWars Life product only to find out they're sold out?
[03:45:12.205 --> 03:45:16.187]  Yeah, I know it kind of sucks, but there is a solution.
[03:45:16.587 --> 03:45:21.510]  All you gotta do is go to InfoWarsStore.com and click on Auto Ship.
[03:45:21.630 --> 03:45:21.971]  Bam!
[03:45:22.211 --> 03:45:24.412]  Problem solved just like that.
[03:45:24.772 --> 03:45:27.514]  And now you're scheduled for regular delivery.
[03:45:27.674 --> 03:45:33.978]  That means no more back orders and you'll never run out of your favorite InfoWars Life products
[03:45:34.258 --> 03:45:34.638]  Again.
[03:45:34.998 --> 03:45:35.439]  Pretty cool.
[03:45:35.699 --> 03:45:36.299]  But guess what?
[03:45:36.579 --> 03:45:37.300]  It gets better.
[03:45:37.540 --> 03:45:45.404]  When you sign up for AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com, you get an additional 10% off that product.
[03:45:46.165 --> 03:45:46.545]  Woo!
[03:45:46.765 --> 03:45:47.765]  That's what I'm talking about.
[03:45:47.785 --> 03:45:49.386]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:45:49.787 --> 03:45:51.487]  Support the InfoWar.
[03:45:52.028 --> 03:45:56.850]  Order and click on AutoShip at InfoWarsStore.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:46:03.052 --> 03:46:04.392]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:46:04.452 --> 03:46:06.233]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:46:06.353 --> 03:46:06.773]  It is.
[03:46:06.973 --> 03:46:11.374]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:46:11.834 --> 03:46:13.114]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:46:13.194 --> 03:46:14.934]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:46:15.014 --> 03:46:17.335]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:46:17.495 --> 03:46:19.055]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:46:19.135 --> 03:46:20.515]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:46:20.575 --> 03:46:21.795]  You've got the children's.
[03:46:21.956 --> 03:46:22.896]  You've got the adults.
[03:46:23.076 --> 03:46:23.976]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:46:24.056 --> 03:46:27.437]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[03:46:27.457 --> 03:46:29.817]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best.
[03:46:30.037 --> 03:46:31.237]  And it'll give you the damn burps.
[03:46:31.377 --> 03:46:32.058]  And I'm sorry.
[03:46:32.158 --> 03:46:33.158]  You want something like this?
[03:46:33.238 --> 03:46:34.118]  You don't get stuff for free.
[03:46:34.218 --> 03:46:36.078]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[03:46:36.138 --> 03:46:36.679]  It's so good.
[03:46:36.739 --> 03:46:37.259]  In my view.
[03:46:37.359 --> 03:46:39.339]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[03:46:39.379 --> 03:46:44.020]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:46:45.781 --> 03:46:50.322]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:46:53.288 --> 03:46:59.135]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:46:59.195 --> 03:47:00.116]  I just can't do it!
[03:47:06.303 --> 03:47:08.906]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.861 --> 03:47:29.486]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.887 --> 03:47:34.891]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:36.092 --> 03:47:47.841]  We're gonna throw here to the video that I just put out a couple of hours ago, completely rebutting and debunking BuzzFeed's fake news about this Notre Dame fire.
[03:47:48.642 --> 03:47:50.744]  Another article we had on Summit News yesterday,
[03:47:51.494 --> 03:47:54.495]  France attacks against Jews and Christians continue to rise.
[03:47:54.515 --> 03:48:01.176]  That was a big article, pretty coincidental that it came out literally an hour before this in terms of attacks on churches.
[03:48:01.256 --> 03:48:07.137]  Oh, but we can't talk about that because it's a conspiracy theory that 900 churches were attacked in France last year.
[03:48:07.157 --> 03:48:12.198]  And again, anti-Semitic hate crimes way up in France.
[03:48:12.598 --> 03:48:15.539]  The anti-Christian hate crimes also climbed
[03:48:16.224 --> 03:48:19.485]  Anti-Muslim hate crimes are at their lowest since 2010.
[03:48:20.065 --> 03:48:22.406]  At their lowest for nine years.
[03:48:23.066 --> 03:48:24.547]  So again, what is the real problem?
[03:48:24.567 --> 03:48:32.309]  What is the real conversation that we should be having here in the aftermath of this Notre Dame fire, which was an accident.
[03:48:32.329 --> 03:48:32.969]  Don't get me wrong.
[03:48:33.589 --> 03:48:34.589]  We're going to go to this clip.
[03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:39.551]  This is the full video of the Notre Dame fire, which is available on my YouTube channel, which you can go.
[03:48:39.651 --> 03:48:40.811]  Please get this, share it out.
[03:48:40.911 --> 03:48:42.712]  And here is that full video.
[03:48:47.119 --> 03:48:56.143]  So Buzzfeed just got caught sharing hoax misinformation about the Notre Dame fire, and then blamed me for sharing hoax misinformation about the Notre Dame fire.
[03:48:56.244 --> 03:49:07.329]  While the blaze was still raging, I posted this tweet in which I stated a brief summary of who is responding to the tragic Notre Dame fire with smiley faces on Facebook.
[03:49:07.489 --> 03:49:12.111]  The video attached to this tweet was a live Facebook feed of the Notre Dame fire.
[03:49:12.211 --> 03:49:19.035]  In this video, you can see a list of who was reacting in real time to the fire with smiley emoticons.
[03:49:19.375 --> 03:49:21.836]  Take a good, long look.
[03:49:22.076 --> 03:49:26.519]  The video clearly shows the Notre Dame Cathedral burning in the background.
[03:49:26.719 --> 03:49:30.581]  And here's the original Facebook video from where my tweet was grabbed.
[03:49:31.101 --> 03:49:32.441]  It's a page called Brut.
[03:49:32.521 --> 03:49:34.382]  It has over 7 million views.
[03:49:34.402 --> 03:49:37.262]  Now you see, Brut was live at Notre Dame Paris.
[03:49:37.322 --> 03:49:38.783]  You can check all this for yourself.
[03:49:39.083 --> 03:49:42.264]  Again, you see the Notre Dame burning in the video.
[03:49:42.584 --> 03:49:45.004]  It's the same video that I tweeted.
[03:49:45.244 --> 03:49:54.566]  And this screenshot from the original live at Notre Dame video shows people reacting with smiley faces as Notre Dame burns.
[03:49:54.786 --> 03:49:57.567]  Now, how do you think BuzzFeed reported on this?
[03:49:57.867 --> 03:50:05.351]  In a giant article about hoaxes and misinformation surrounding the Notre Dame fire, BuzzFeed's Jane Litvinenko wrote the following.
[03:50:05.711 --> 03:50:10.073]  There's zero evidence Muslims were responding to the fire with smiley faces!
[03:50:10.213 --> 03:50:15.436]  Paul Joseph Watson tweeted a link to a video that claimed to show Muslim people celebrating the fire.
[03:50:15.516 --> 03:50:19.858]  Critically, the video in question does not show what people on Facebook were reacting to.
[03:50:20.138 --> 03:50:26.501]  It's also impossible to know the religious views of each person reacting to a video en masse, so we really have no idea what was going on here.
[03:50:26.741 --> 03:50:29.044]  And there is no proof to back up this claim.
[03:50:29.224 --> 03:50:29.744]  Really?
[03:50:30.065 --> 03:50:35.310]  Well, first, I never said it showed, quote, Muslim people celebrating the fire.
[03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:36.832]  That's lie number one.
[03:50:36.972 --> 03:50:38.594]  It wasn't even in my tweet.
[03:50:38.754 --> 03:50:43.038]  And secondly, yes, the video does show what people were reacting to.
[03:50:43.179 --> 03:50:45.341]  They're reacting to the Notre Dame fire.
[03:50:45.681 --> 03:50:46.242]  It's right...
[03:50:46.462 --> 03:50:50.163]  They're in the background at the start of the frigging clip.
[03:50:50.363 --> 03:50:56.664]  And here's the original, where they're quite clearly reacting to the Notre Dame fire with smiley faces.
[03:50:56.684 --> 03:50:59.825]  The video was authentic, and it's in the video.
[03:50:59.925 --> 03:51:06.607]  So BuzzFeed published fake news claiming I was engaged in a hoax, when they were the ones engaged in the hoax.
[03:51:06.887 --> 03:51:13.629]  Oh yeah, and Jane, putting a stupid NOPE yellow sticker on my tweet doesn't invalidate its accuracy.
[03:51:13.869 --> 03:51:15.229]  Even this tweet is wrong.
[03:51:15.689 --> 03:51:19.214]  She claims this screenshot also doesn't show the video itself.
[03:51:19.574 --> 03:51:20.516]  Yes it does!
[03:51:20.936 --> 03:51:22.038]  Here's the video!
[03:51:22.238 --> 03:51:28.727]  You lied, you were called out for it, I asked you for a retraction on numerous occasions, and you did nothing!
[03:51:28.887 --> 03:51:31.631]  You're deliberately putting out fake news!
[03:51:31.811 --> 03:51:33.033]  This is why you suck!
[03:51:33.413 --> 03:51:35.114]  This is why no one trusts you.
[03:51:35.214 --> 03:51:39.896]  This is why BuzzFeed is going bust and laying off staff left, right and centre.
[03:51:40.016 --> 03:51:47.560]  As to the wider question of were Muslims celebrating the fire, which I never even said in the tweet, but they say I said it, so I guess let's just go with it.
[03:51:47.680 --> 03:51:49.260]  Let's take a closer look.
[03:51:49.620 --> 03:51:52.302]  This is called research, BuzzFeed.
[03:51:52.522 --> 03:51:53.882]  You should try it sometime.
[03:51:53.962 --> 03:51:59.065]  Here's a selection of comments I grabbed from just two threads about the Notre Dame fire
[03:51:59.465 --> 03:52:03.007]  From France 24, Arabic's Facebook page.
[03:52:03.108 --> 03:52:06.010]  These comments are all translated from Arabic.
[03:52:06.510 --> 03:52:08.892]  What were these people saying about the fire?
[03:52:09.112 --> 03:52:13.435]  I am disappointed for the lack of charred bodies in this festive party.
[03:52:13.515 --> 03:52:15.636]  What a wonderful moment, God thank you.
[03:52:15.796 --> 03:52:18.838]  I dedicate this wonderful and beautiful fire to my family.
[03:52:18.938 --> 03:52:22.481]  Congratulations, hopefully the mass destruction of France.
[03:52:22.841 --> 03:52:23.942]  It's a beautiful fire.
[03:52:24.142 --> 03:52:26.424]  OMG, the most beautiful fire in the world!
[03:52:26.545 --> 03:52:30.088]  We announce the sympathy of our full solidarity with the fire.
[03:52:30.208 --> 03:52:33.331]  Unfortunately, the entire structure did not collapse.
[03:52:33.572 --> 03:52:35.413]  I am sympathetic to the fire.
[03:52:35.654 --> 03:52:38.497]  I dedicate this fire to all the Algerian people.
[03:52:38.897 --> 03:52:40.258]  And we wish another fire.
[03:52:40.358 --> 03:52:42.781]  God willing, the next on the Eiffel Tower.
[03:52:43.101 --> 03:52:48.506]  I am very happy, smiley face, smiley face, to see part of France burning.
[03:52:48.686 --> 03:52:53.891]  People were even posting GIFs which said, yay I'm so happy, and celebrate.
[03:52:54.192 --> 03:52:58.936]  Again, these comments were grabbed from just two small sections of two threads.
[03:52:59.096 --> 03:53:03.080]  From what I saw, nearly every other comment was celebrating the fire.
[03:53:03.220 --> 03:53:06.724]  Let's look at how Al Jazeera viewers were reacting to the fire.
[03:53:06.824 --> 03:53:11.269]  Here's how they reacted to stories about the fire on Al Jazeera's Facebook page.
[03:53:11.609 --> 03:53:15.573]  Again, note the names and note the smiley faces.
[03:53:15.693 --> 03:53:23.822]  Remember, BuzzFeed claimed, quote, there's no evidence Muslims were responding to the fire with smiley faces, really.
[03:53:24.042 --> 03:53:29.726]  Let's let it run a little further so you can get a good sample of that reaction.
[03:53:29.846 --> 03:53:39.094]  Remember BuzzFeed quote, Guess I must just be imagining all these smiley faces then.
[03:53:39.294 --> 03:53:45.619]  Here's a screenshot from the original Facebook video, the one which BuzzFeed lied about and said was a hoax, with someone commenting,
[03:53:47.640 --> 03:53:48.701]  Is that a hoax too?
[03:53:48.821 --> 03:53:49.822]  Am I making that up?
[03:53:49.982 --> 03:53:54.065]  BuzzFeed, Jane Litvinenko, or were you the ones who put out a hoax?
[03:53:54.345 --> 03:54:00.889]  Unlike BuzzFeed, which apparently doesn't know how to do basic research, you could go and check all this out for yourself.
[03:54:00.969 --> 03:54:06.273]  The comments are all still on France 24 Arabic's Facebook page and Al Jazeera's Facebook page.
[03:54:06.333 --> 03:54:08.815]  Were Muslims celebrating the Notre Dame fire?
[03:54:09.255 --> 03:54:09.695]  Yes.
[03:54:10.136 --> 03:54:10.816]  It's a fact.
[03:54:11.136 --> 03:54:13.117]  And there's evidence in abundance.
[03:54:13.277 --> 03:54:14.458]  And that's a big problem.
[03:54:14.478 --> 03:54:18.140]  That's a reality we need to face up to and have a conversation about.
[03:54:18.240 --> 03:54:23.163]  It's not a conversation that you can just cover up and sweep under the rug by claiming it never happened.
[03:54:23.764 --> 03:54:24.484]  It happened.
[03:54:24.684 --> 03:54:32.949]  In their Morning Tech newsletter, Politico also claimed Paul Joseph Watson shared a hoax claiming Muslims were reacting positively to the fire.
[03:54:33.049 --> 03:54:37.211]  No, you're the one sharing the hoax, Politico, because it did happen.
[03:54:37.311 --> 03:54:44.195]  BuzzFeed's Ryan Broderick thinks people should be removed from Twitter for spreading, quote, misinformation.
[03:54:44.255 --> 03:54:50.779]  Better remove BuzzFeed, then, because they're openly spreading misinformation about the reaction to the Notre Dame fire.
[03:54:50.899 --> 03:54:52.020]  See how this works?
[03:54:52.160 --> 03:55:01.245]  They lobby social media companies to de-platform me for spreading conspiracy theories when they're the ones spreading conspiracy theories.
[03:55:01.345 --> 03:55:04.606]  Does that mean that every Muslim was celebrating the Notre Dame fire?
[03:55:04.806 --> 03:55:05.026]  No.
[03:55:05.186 --> 03:55:12.227]  Does it mean that BuzzFeed and Politico lied in reporting that the claim Muslims were celebrating the Notre Dame fire was a hoax?
[03:55:12.987 --> 03:55:13.308]  Yes.
[03:55:13.568 --> 03:55:26.770]  Instead of denouncing the vile rhetoric of those celebrating the destruction of a cherished piece of history, BuzzFeed denounced me and ran defense for the very people spewing that vile rhetoric.
[03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:29.831]  Do these individuals seem to be horrified by the fire?
[03:55:30.171 --> 03:55:32.072]  How about these individuals?
[03:55:32.153 --> 03:55:35.355]  So don't get me wrong, it wasn't just Muslims who were celebrating the fire.
[03:55:35.695 --> 03:55:38.718]  Many leftists could barely contain their glee either.
[03:55:38.938 --> 03:55:45.843]  Notre Dame burning is cosmic karma for all the historical sites and artifacts France destroyed and stole when being colonialists.
[03:55:45.883 --> 03:55:46.544]  Scum!
[03:55:46.564 --> 03:55:47.464]  Genuinely awful.
[03:55:47.484 --> 03:55:50.867]  But if you mourn for this one building and not, say, the entirety of Syria,
[03:55:51.147 --> 03:55:53.888]  Your white supremacy is showing!
[03:55:54.108 --> 03:55:58.470]  Notre Dame on fire is the most aesthetically pleasing visually I've ever seen.
[03:55:58.631 --> 03:55:59.651]  Notre Dame burns.
[03:55:59.951 --> 03:56:01.112]  Former French colonies.
[03:56:01.172 --> 03:56:07.135]  Alongside a video of a guy laughing his head off with nearly 22 million views.
[03:56:07.355 --> 03:56:09.076]  Oh, but no one celebrated it.
[03:56:09.176 --> 03:56:12.517]  According to BuzzFeed, it's just one giant conspiracy theory.
[03:56:12.617 --> 03:56:15.659]  This one's for colonizing African countries, bitch!
[03:56:15.819 --> 03:56:16.119]  Yeah.
[03:56:16.539 --> 03:56:24.062]  Notre Dame was completed in 1345, that's 70 years before the first wave of European colonisation.
[03:56:24.162 --> 03:56:26.143]  Do some f***ing maths, moron!
[03:56:26.323 --> 03:56:31.465]  So yes, people celebrated, Muslims celebrated, leftists celebrated.
[03:56:31.565 --> 03:56:35.006]  And what does that tell us about the state of Western civilisation?
[03:56:35.106 --> 03:56:37.667]  They laugh, they party, they say it's karma.
[03:56:37.827 --> 03:56:43.449]  Then our own media runs defence for them and says all of that never happened and it's all a hoax.
[03:56:43.590 --> 03:56:51.053]  Now I know the Notre Dame fire was accidental but in France churches are being burned and desecrated on a regular basis.
[03:56:51.153 --> 03:56:57.996]  Public statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary are being decapitated and destroyed and the media barely reports on it.
[03:56:58.056 --> 03:57:02.778]  In France there are ten times the number of anti-Christian attacks compared to anti-Muslim attacks.
[03:57:04.980 --> 03:57:08.463]  875 Christian churches in France were vandalised last year alone.
[03:57:08.644 --> 03:57:10.926]  Jews are fleeing France in record numbers.
[03:57:10.986 --> 03:57:14.129]  And it's time more people started talking about it.
[03:57:14.209 --> 03:57:20.695]  When Islamic sites are burned, attacked or desecrated, we respect their grief and mourning, and rightly so.
[03:57:20.735 --> 03:57:27.562]  When Christian sites are burned, attacked or desecrated, apparently, to a lot of people, it's just one big
[03:57:27.902 --> 03:57:28.523]  The good news is,
[03:57:55.777 --> 03:58:05.544]  After a year and a half long battle to secure the deep-earth crystals that nobody else has for the purest atomic iodine out there, we have been able to secure X2.
[03:58:06.244 --> 03:58:07.765]  I was sure we weren't going to be able to get it.
[03:58:08.105 --> 03:58:10.887]  It's a derivative that the oil companies get between 7,000 and 12,000 feet.
[03:58:11.367 --> 03:58:22.495]  There's globalist industrial espionage that goes on where they try to not just take our sponsors and things, but actually stop us from getting the raw material because this is under DEA control to get the raw stuff because it's so powerful.
[03:58:23.055 --> 03:58:25.317]  So X2, after being sold out for several months,
[03:58:26.397 --> 03:58:30.599]  We were able to get it back into production from its original producer, and we now have it.
[03:58:30.979 --> 03:58:34.160]  And it is the purest, best, good halogen out there.
[03:58:34.620 --> 03:58:39.781]  Just research how IQs went down massively in the Midwest because they didn't have any iodine in the soil.
[03:58:39.801 --> 03:58:44.203]  Once the government added it, it just did all of these insanely good things.
[03:58:44.503 --> 03:58:45.083]  Research.
[03:58:45.683 --> 03:58:46.223]  It's incredible.
[03:58:46.484 --> 03:58:47.324]  One of God's great gifts.
[03:58:48.064 --> 03:58:48.924]  So X2's back.
[03:58:49.065 --> 03:58:50.065]  It's ended about a week and a half.
[03:58:50.085 --> 03:58:51.646]  You can pre-order at InfoWarshore.com.
[03:58:51.666 --> 03:58:53.487]  I almost forgot.
[03:58:53.867 --> 03:58:56.508]  25% off out of the gates to celebrate the fact that it's back.
[03:58:56.528 --> 03:58:57.189]  I forgot that part.
[03:58:57.209 --> 03:58:57.329]  25% off X2.
