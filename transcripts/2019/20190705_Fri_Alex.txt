[00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:21.785]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:21.785 --> 00:00:29.449]  Du, du hast, du hast mich.
[00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.151]  Du, du hast, du hast mich.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.644]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on July 5th, 2019.
[00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:06.027]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:06.027 --> 00:01:13.132]  Last night, I watched Trump's speech when they re-aired it on C-SPAN, and it was...
[00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:21.743]  Very powerful and a confirmation of just how far we're going as a culture and a society against the globalists.
[00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:29.625]  And this was an exorcism against the New World Order and against the America-hating systems that wanted to demoralize us.
[00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:37.288]  This was a very Christian, very Americana, pure Western Renaissance moment.
[00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:39.728]  This was absolutely amazing.
[00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:41.289]  I am so honored by it all.
[00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:46.015]  That we've come this far together, and I know a lot of you are very, very happy right now.
[00:01:46.015 --> 00:01:47.416]  This is a big deal.
[00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.117]  It's totally triggering the globalists.
[00:01:49.117 --> 00:01:53.200]  There's no way today that we're going to even be able to do justice to this.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:03.767]  I'm going to do a whole special 36-hour broadcast, we've decided, kicking off next Wednesday, just to dissect this speech and go over it at the reboot of 1776 worldwide.
[00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:05.809]  It's all coming up at the start of the next segment.
[00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:10.812]  But first, proof Democrats hate America and want civil war compared to what we're trying to do.
[00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:11.093]  Here it is.
[00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.365]  When I hear these things about, let's make America great again, I think to myself, well exactly when did you think America was great?
[00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:20.426]  We're not going to make America great again.
[00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:22.528]  It was never that great.
[00:02:22.528 --> 00:02:25.750]  There's things that are savagely wrong in this country.
[00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.733]  What we're seeing in this country doesn't reflect our spirit.
[00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:32.055]  What we're seeing in this country doesn't reflect our potential.
[00:02:32.055 --> 00:02:36.719]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:44.543]  Yes, we're supposed to be for a 70% tax rate on the wealthy.
[00:02:44.543 --> 00:02:53.094]  You hear folks say there's not enough money, what I say to them every single time is, there's plenty of money in this world, there's plenty of money in this country, it's just in the wrong hands.
[00:02:53.094 --> 00:02:57.460]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:00.523]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[00:03:00.523 --> 00:03:06.407]  We're in late phase capitalism and we know it doesn't work and we've got to move into something new.
[00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:12.011]  And I believe in community ownership of land, labor, resources and distribution of those resources.
[00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:17.875]  And so whatever that morphs into I think is what will serve community the best.
[00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:21.477]  And I'm excited to usher it in by any means necessary.
[00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:23.518]  Any means necessary.
[00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:26.480]  This liberal will be all about socializing.
[00:03:29.184 --> 00:03:40.070]  Would be about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies.
[00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:47.034]  Raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross a border without documentation.
[00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:49.876]  Can we keep our hands up so we can see them?
[00:03:51.084 --> 00:03:54.730]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.497]  No Trump, no wall, no USA at all!
[00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:16.105]  These people who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace and there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:22.331]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down and they should be prosecuted.
[00:04:22.892 --> 00:04:23.673]  I want them shut down.
[00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:24.634]  I want them silenced.
[00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:25.455]  I want them muted.
[00:04:25.455 --> 00:04:27.478]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:04:27.478 --> 00:04:33.586]  So folks, look, if you start off with the notion there's nothing you can do, well, why don't you all go home then, man?
[00:04:33.586 --> 00:04:36.510]  Or let's start a real physical revolution if you're talking about it.
[00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:46.132]  A so-called anti-fascist website is encouraging, quote, all manner of physical violence against Trump supporters and capitalists.
[00:04:46.132 --> 00:04:51.316]  Today we are lifting up these stories in the hopes that you will see the light!
[00:04:51.316 --> 00:04:54.738]  And if you don't, we will bring the fire!
[00:04:54.738 --> 00:04:55.799]  No, no!
[00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:58.341]  Get the f*** out of here!
[00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:07.048]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.
[00:05:07.048 --> 00:05:10.490]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.
[00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:19.414]  With the incredible ingredients in this formula, we can help you beat the test of time and assist in restoring that lost energy and mood that comes with time and age.
[00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:27.558]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sports performance or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[00:05:28.178 --> 00:05:33.599]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male path.
[00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:40.821]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[00:05:40.821 --> 00:05:44.522]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[00:05:44.522 --> 00:05:47.563]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[00:05:47.563 --> 00:05:51.604]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:54.105]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.830]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.633]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:14.835]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:33.078 --> 00:06:39.324]  This is going to be an incredibly important broadcast, as they all are, but this one particularly.
[00:06:39.324 --> 00:06:54.859]  I don't really have the proper words to describe how the planets aligned yesterday for this Washington, D.C., July 4th, 2019 speech the President gave and what unfolded and what happened.
[00:06:55.976 --> 00:07:21.513]  What he said, what we've gone through together, what it signifies historically and currently and for the future, what he invoked, what power he called down, versus the globalists and the corporate media spinning and rolling and spitting and hissing in total abject hatred and the public completely turning against them when they did it.
[00:07:21.513 --> 00:07:23.554]  It is a Rosetta Stone.
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:32.683]  A skeleton key, a window into the good and the bad.
[00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:36.025]  What an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:36.025 --> 00:07:38.025]  What an amazing time.
[00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:42.247]  Our own Millie Weaver and, of course, Caitlin Bennett were there.
[00:07:42.247 --> 00:07:46.209]  They're going to be joining me throughout the weekend with all their special reports that are coming out.
[00:07:47.039 --> 00:07:47.980]  They shot it all in HD.
[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.301]  They're going to be with us this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:55.604]  We're going to have constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, who I love co-hosting with me.
[00:07:55.604 --> 00:08:01.627]  He's going to be in studio third hour, so is Leo Zagami.
[00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:14.654]  But as I so often do, I'm going to lay out why all this is so special and why all this is so amazing.
[00:08:17.114 --> 00:08:19.155]  At the bottom of the hour.
[00:08:19.155 --> 00:08:23.938]  I'm not ready to do it yet.
[00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:39.586]  Because so much of the speech was so powerful that I still need to cogitate for a few more segments on why this is so important and why this has got the globalists so incredibly upset.
[00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:42.228]  And I'll do the best job I can.
[00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:50.672]  The most important part of all this, and the footage we have, is from Fox.
[00:08:50.672 --> 00:08:57.416]  It's a little bit different footage, with the cameras lined up, shooting through the armored glass.
[00:08:57.416 --> 00:09:03.580]  The C-SPAN 2 shot was a different mix of cameras, and was closer up on Melania and Trump's faces.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.742]  And I've got to get that.
[00:09:08.742 --> 00:09:12.565]  Because Trump almost broke down crying three times.
[00:09:13.427 --> 00:09:16.890]  And you can see him gulping back, never seen his body language.
[00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:34.906]  Melania was on fire, like some angelic queen, and was radiating Americana and the love of the country, and they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:37.248]  And I understand that this is literally a ritual
[00:09:38.457 --> 00:09:43.340]  Bringing Christianity back into America, and love of our nation, and love of our people, and unity.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:51.325]  The exact opposite of what the globalists are saying, and what the globalists are doing.
[00:09:51.325 --> 00:09:55.187]  It's just, it's just mind-blowing.
[00:09:55.187 --> 00:10:01.991]  And all of the different Christian songs that they played, and invoking God, and invoking Christ,
[00:10:03.072 --> 00:10:21.145]  And to see that huge, diverse crowd of people out there wanting to come together, wanting to love the good parts of America, and knowing that Trump's pulling troops out of all these countries and trying to stop all these big wars, and has been nominated for a Peace Prize, which he actually deserves.
[00:10:21.145 --> 00:10:30.872]  That's why we then celebrate our military and all of it, because the globalists are trying to divide us, demoralize us, culturally poison us.
[00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:45.522]  And when I watched Trump's body language last night on that HD television, that refeed of it, because I was out with my family at the lake during the day, I thought, I'm sure the speech will be a unification speech.
[00:10:45.522 --> 00:10:46.802]  I'm sure it'll be great.
[00:10:46.802 --> 00:10:54.304]  But when I saw Trump's emotions and Melania's emotions, you cannot fake this type of genuineness.
[00:10:54.304 --> 00:11:00.925]  And it was, you could tell that they've also been persecuted greatly and have put out incredible energy.
[00:11:02.102 --> 00:11:07.623]  And have turned their will as hard as they can into this fight.
[00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:21.927]  And that seeing that crowd of people in defiance of the globalist tyranny and their poison, and witnessing all of that, buoyed them.
[00:11:21.927 --> 00:11:24.247]  It put wind in their sails.
[00:11:24.247 --> 00:11:25.788]  It gave them aid and comfort.
[00:11:25.788 --> 00:11:26.688]  It refreshed them.
[00:11:28.786 --> 00:11:35.948]  And it refreshed me, and it refreshed you, like rain in the desert when plants are close to death.
[00:11:35.948 --> 00:11:40.689]  This, I'm telling you, is a major breaking point for the globalists.
[00:11:40.689 --> 00:11:49.772]  I want to say that if we continue down this path, their back is beginning to break.
[00:11:49.772 --> 00:11:50.932]  In fact, it's already broken.
[00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:56.668]  And it's gonna be rough and it's gonna be hard, but there's light at the end of the tunnel.
[00:11:56.668 --> 00:11:58.570]  There's not just evil in this world.
[00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:05.575]  That's why Hollywood and Netflix and all the media is just death, destruction, negativity, patheticness, evil.
[00:12:05.575 --> 00:12:07.836]  And the weak-minded give in to it.
[00:12:07.836 --> 00:12:16.442]  But those of us that stand against it get stronger and persevere in that fight.
[00:12:16.442 --> 00:12:20.385]  I saw not a power trip
[00:12:21.678 --> 00:12:36.229]  Not someone loving that crowd of people there, but I saw Trump in the office of president with his wife, turning the tide with all those people together in a huge ritual.
[00:12:36.229 --> 00:12:45.016]  I called it, the headlines on Infowars.com, Trump successfully performs exorcism
[00:12:47.498 --> 00:12:47.838]  I don't know.
[00:13:06.974 --> 00:13:11.876]  That InfoWars has laid the launchpad and the groundwork for this.
[00:13:11.876 --> 00:13:13.637]  That means you've done this.
[00:13:13.637 --> 00:13:14.317]  Watch live.
[00:13:14.317 --> 00:13:21.541]  Trump successfully conducts anti-globalist exorcism in powerful 4th of July speech.
[00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:25.342]  I almost said in powerful 4th of July ritual.
[00:13:25.342 --> 00:13:27.903]  This was a ritual.
[00:13:27.903 --> 00:13:30.505]  You ever want to see a real ritual?
[00:13:30.505 --> 00:13:35.547]  You just saw one with tens of millions of people that love America tuning in and watching.
[00:13:36.561 --> 00:13:42.009]  With hundreds of thousands there standing in defiance of the left and the demoralization.
[00:13:42.009 --> 00:13:51.444]  And Trump and his wife that have been through the fire and are totally committed and have worked so hard to try to bring about this awakening, in the center of it,
[00:13:53.812 --> 00:14:02.120]  In between the thunderstorms and the lightning just miles away, with the jets roaring overhead, this was powerful.
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:08.767]  This was a big glass of cold, delicious, clean water when a man's come out of the desert.
[00:14:08.767 --> 00:14:10.809]  This was the stuff of legend.
[00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:26.640]  Because we are America and the spirit of America, the cult of America, based on Christ, based on rugged individualism, based on fighting corrupt empires and leading the free world is powerful.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.562]  And the globalists have been trying to suppress it and undermine it and kill it.
[00:14:30.562 --> 00:14:37.325]  And they came very close, but now roaring back like the fiery phoenix from the dead.
[00:14:37.325 --> 00:14:40.867]  You have seen a real ritual.
[00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:46.924]  That shakes the globalist to their core.
[00:14:46.924 --> 00:14:49.885]  You've seen an American ritual.
[00:14:49.885 --> 00:14:52.527]  An American relaunch ritual.
[00:14:52.527 --> 00:14:55.188]  You've lived to see it.
[00:14:55.188 --> 00:15:06.994]  Three years after Trump got into office, a little bit less, and all that's already been delivered, and the enemy throwing everything they've got at us to hold back the recovery, Trump taking control of the Federal Reserve.
[00:15:06.994 --> 00:15:08.375]  I forgot to hit that Wednesday.
[00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:09.816]  Please pull me the whole stack from Wednesday.
[00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.172]  Trump just nominated two patriots to the Federal Reserve.
[00:15:14.172 --> 00:15:16.333]  He's taking it over.
[00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:18.335]  Everything's happening.
[00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:24.159]  We're not winning on every front, but we're winning overall, and this is an incredible time.
[00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:28.442]  At the bottom of the hour, I'm going to get to all these clips.
[00:15:28.442 --> 00:15:31.345]  The Christian music.
[00:15:31.345 --> 00:15:35.528]  The Christ being invoked.
[00:15:35.528 --> 00:15:36.789]  The Renaissance.
[00:15:36.789 --> 00:15:39.031]  Human exceptionalism.
[00:15:39.031 --> 00:15:41.833]  The search for excellence.
[00:15:43.596 --> 00:15:44.110]  All of this.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.203]  It is 180 degrees the opposite of what the globalists sell.
[00:15:50.203 --> 00:15:51.364]  The end of humans.
[00:15:51.364 --> 00:15:53.085]  The end of the human journey.
[00:15:53.085 --> 00:15:53.945]  Humans are bad.
[00:15:53.945 --> 00:15:54.786]  Humans are evil.
[00:15:54.786 --> 00:15:55.647]  Roll over and die.
[00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:56.487]  Give up.
[00:15:56.487 --> 00:15:57.047]  Give up.
[00:15:57.047 --> 00:15:57.868]  Give up.
[00:15:57.868 --> 00:15:59.549]  No, we will not.
[00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:00.790]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.713]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:06.254]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:16:06.254 --> 00:16:09.215]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:14.399]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:15.941]  I can help you too.

[00:17:05.586 --> 00:17:07.327]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:17:07.327 --> 00:17:13.892]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:17:13.892 --> 00:17:18.956]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[00:18:00.418 --> 00:18:01.759]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:02.479]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[00:18:02.479 --> 00:18:03.119]  Thanks for holding.
[00:18:03.119 --> 00:18:03.640]  Hey, Alex.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.461]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:12.565]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[00:18:12.565 --> 00:18:21.370]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.330]  That's it.
[00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:25.172]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[00:18:25.172 --> 00:18:28.033]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[00:18:28.033 --> 00:18:29.314]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[00:18:29.494 --> 00:18:30.234]  I agree entirely.
[00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:35.677]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:38.479]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[00:18:38.479 --> 00:18:40.540]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:49.784]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[00:18:49.784 --> 00:18:51.685]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[00:18:51.685 --> 00:18:58.188]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[00:18:58.188 --> 00:18:59.109]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.341]  The time has come.
[00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:03.322]  The time is here.
[00:19:03.322 --> 00:19:15.351]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[00:19:15.351 --> 00:19:26.920]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.280]  We're good.
[00:19:49.065 --> 00:19:51.007]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:42.915 --> 00:20:45.196]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:20:45.196 --> 00:20:47.418]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:20:47.418 --> 00:20:53.261]  Okay, next segment, I have a whole list here of Trump's comments and statements.
[00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:57.824]  Dozens and dozens and dozens of clips I want to get to and I'm going to do my best to go to a lot of them.
[00:20:57.824 --> 00:21:01.025]  Most importantly is the battle hymn of the republic.
[00:21:01.025 --> 00:21:10.231]  You never saw Obama or others at their events do things like this because they took the patriotism and our history out of who we are to demoralize us.
[00:21:11.363 --> 00:21:24.005]  And again, one of my representatives went to a major film conference this year, Sundance, and it was admitted that the plan was to demoralize and control the public.
[00:21:24.946 --> 00:21:29.168]  So this is an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:29.168 --> 00:21:34.270]  I'd like to direct all the TV viewers and listeners to something that needs to go mega viral.
[00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:43.334]  And at the minute I saw it this morning at Summit.News, we also posted Paul's article at Infowars.com and Newswars.com that it was going to go viral.
[00:21:43.334 --> 00:21:47.116]  And that's this report that's linked on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:21:47.116 --> 00:21:50.958]  We'll put DrudgeReport.com up on screen for TV viewers.
[00:21:50.958 --> 00:21:53.039]  And we can then click on the link right there.
[00:21:54.673 --> 00:22:00.336]  And everybody can share the link.
[00:22:00.336 --> 00:22:10.240]  That media predictions of tiny crowd for Trump, July 4th speech proven spectacularly wrong.
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.362]  Now, remember they said that no one showed up to the Trump event.
[00:22:18.294 --> 00:22:32.588]  In 2017 when he was inaugurated and that's because they showed the fences around the mall right as they were opening and only showed small crowds getting through the police checkpoints.
[00:22:32.588 --> 00:22:34.530]  But then of course there was
[00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:44.103]  CNN's own megapixel camera that showed me in the crowd and it showed that it was undoubtedly the biggest crowd in history for an inauguration.
[00:22:44.103 --> 00:22:47.325]  But they said Trump was a liar and obsessed with crowd sizes.
[00:22:47.325 --> 00:22:58.551]  No, Trump was obsessed with the fact that the media was lying and saying that there was nobody there.
[00:23:00.714 --> 00:23:08.416]  That level of blatant, ball-faced lying blew the President away.
[00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:13.658]  Completely confused the President that they would go to that level of lying.
[00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:22.921]  Because before then, they wouldn't have an event that millions were at and then tell people and show people a shot from 8.30 in the morning when they first opened the gates.
[00:23:24.022 --> 00:23:26.644]  They would never try a lie that big of a whopper.
[00:23:26.644 --> 00:23:29.966]  They'd never say that Trump says all Mexicans are criminals when he never said that.
[00:23:29.966 --> 00:23:35.110]  They'd never send somebody child porn and then say that they had child porn.
[00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:37.832]  They do that now.
[00:23:37.832 --> 00:23:38.693]  That's what they do.
[00:23:38.693 --> 00:23:48.340]  They would never say that, oh, I saw, remember Acosta, Alexandria Cortez, AOC, she said, I saw people drinking out of toilets.
[00:23:50.097 --> 00:23:51.378]  Then later she said, oh no, no, no.
[00:23:51.378 --> 00:23:52.980]  Someone told me they saw it.
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.861]  Total lie!
[00:23:54.861 --> 00:24:01.047]  They have water coolers in the room and a sink that has a button for water.
[00:24:01.047 --> 00:24:04.610]  But they give them filtered water in a cooler.
[00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.632]  Everybody knows that.
[00:24:06.632 --> 00:24:07.273]  But they lied.
[00:24:07.273 --> 00:24:08.594]  See, and you're like, well that's a whopper.
[00:24:08.594 --> 00:24:09.515]  How would you do that?
[00:24:09.515 --> 00:24:11.537]  They don't care anymore.
[00:24:11.537 --> 00:24:13.559]  They'll do anything.
[00:24:14.858 --> 00:24:24.660]  NPR did a piece on me and said that I was kidnapped and tied up when I was 15 and all of my teeth were knocked out.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.561]  No percentage point of that is true.
[00:24:26.561 --> 00:24:28.841]  I've never had teeth knocked out.
[00:24:28.841 --> 00:24:37.363]  I've never been grabbed and kidnapped and tied up like some Hollywood movie by a bunch of nerds that I would bully and beat up.
[00:24:37.363 --> 00:24:39.624]  So they all got me and tied me up.
[00:24:39.624 --> 00:24:41.785]  And they don't care, folks!
[00:24:41.785 --> 00:24:43.505]  They are fiction writers.
[00:24:48.576 --> 00:24:49.677]  Acosta doesn't care.
[00:24:49.677 --> 00:24:58.784]  AOC doesn't care.
[00:24:58.784 --> 00:25:06.329]  Because they think they've got the big corporate media backing them up, and so they know they'll be protected.
[00:25:06.329 --> 00:25:06.990]  But here's the difference.
[00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.513]  People remember all this now.
[00:25:11.513 --> 00:25:16.017]  What if you're the millions of people trying to get into the inauguration, and you're being physically attacked?
[00:25:17.062 --> 00:25:19.684]  by Antifa, and the police are letting it happen.
[00:25:19.684 --> 00:25:25.209]  You never forget that.
[00:25:25.209 --> 00:25:31.954]  The question is, though, if they keep increasing the lies and getting more bold, what are they going to do next?
[00:25:31.954 --> 00:25:36.838]  They already had six women come forward and say Kavanaugh raped them.
[00:25:36.838 --> 00:25:41.181]  Five of them admit now they lied, but they said, well, he's a bad guy.
[00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:42.743]  He deserves it.
[00:25:42.743 --> 00:25:43.784]  He's a Republican.
[00:25:43.784 --> 00:25:46.145]  He deserves to have me say,
[00:25:47.076 --> 00:25:47.914]  That he raped me!
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:54.763]  You know, I know why Kavanaugh actually started yelling a little bit and started crying a little bit.
[00:25:54.763 --> 00:26:07.591]  Because, you know, you think you can be in control your whole life, but when somebody accuses you of raping women or being into child porn and it's not true, and you know they know that they're lying, it makes you want to tear people's heads off.
[00:26:07.591 --> 00:26:09.612]  And you lose control a little bit.
[00:26:09.612 --> 00:26:10.853]  I'll be honest.
[00:26:10.853 --> 00:26:12.574]  It's under my skin.
[00:26:12.574 --> 00:26:13.094]  And you know what?
[00:26:13.094 --> 00:26:18.398]  If it doesn't get under your skin, there's something wrong with you.
[00:26:18.398 --> 00:26:18.918]  But here's the deal.
[00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:20.906]  They hate America.
[00:26:20.906 --> 00:26:22.167]  They admit they hate America.
[00:26:22.167 --> 00:26:23.688]  They've uncloaked themselves.
[00:26:23.688 --> 00:26:36.275]  And so, the challenge has been given, the challenge has been received, and I can feel the spirit of America and freedom worldwide rising 1776 worldwide.
[00:26:36.275 --> 00:26:39.317]  1776 worldwide.
[00:26:39.317 --> 00:26:39.917]  That's what it is.
[00:26:39.917 --> 00:26:41.418]  We're going to go to break.
[00:26:41.418 --> 00:26:42.338]  I've got all these clips.
[00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:48.682]  We're going to start with Battle Hymn of the Republic that was literally an exorcism of these individuals and Melania Trump
[00:26:51.707 --> 00:26:56.009]  Beaming goodness and love and justice with this.
[00:26:56.009 --> 00:26:58.771]  You see the Holy Ghost was upon her.
[00:26:58.771 --> 00:27:00.112]  She was radiant.
[00:27:00.112 --> 00:27:09.097]  Trump was closing his eyes trying not to cry because he's starting to see the goal of saving the country coming back from these horrible vicious demons.
[00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:19.052]  And the enemy is flooding the world with poison now, thinking that that will hopefully toxify society.
[00:27:19.052 --> 00:27:29.595]  I have scores of articles with them now admitting that at Drag Queen Storytime, sponsored by Nambla, children are mounted on top men and hump the men.
[00:27:29.595 --> 00:27:31.976]  We have videos and photos of this.
[00:27:31.976 --> 00:27:34.456]  At gay pride parades, they hump children now.
[00:27:34.456 --> 00:27:37.297]  And you're like, well, that's insane.
[00:27:37.297 --> 00:27:39.598]  In Europe, they have sex with the children in public.
[00:27:41.061 --> 00:27:45.383]  And so many of them did it just two weeks ago at gay pride parades in two European cities.
[00:27:45.383 --> 00:27:55.849]  The police couldn't do anything because it was mayors and others openly having sex with the children in mass rebellion.
[00:27:55.849 --> 00:28:01.952]  The left now goes to grocery stores and takes the tops off ice cream and licks them and spits in the food and celebrates.
[00:28:01.952 --> 00:28:04.233]  It's all men dressed as women doing it.
[00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:06.154]  It's a satanic cult.
[00:28:06.154 --> 00:28:08.135]  They mean business.
[00:28:08.135 --> 00:28:09.416]  And they're usurping everything.
[00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:12.964]  We're going to go to break.
[00:28:12.964 --> 00:28:23.661]  Please get the article that's on DrudgeReport.com, left-hand side, just to show the giant fraud because Paul has all the articles where they said no one's coming to his parade, everyone hates Trump.
[00:28:24.693 --> 00:28:32.682]  And then, even after that, they said no one was there, and the left published photos showing empty areas, trying to lie to the public.
[00:28:32.682 --> 00:28:34.404]  Just like last time.
[00:28:34.404 --> 00:28:40.931]  That article needs to go megaviral, DrudgeReport.com, left-hand side, Summit.News, Paul Joseph Watson's article.
[00:28:42.152 --> 00:28:43.553]  Summit.News.
[00:28:43.553 --> 00:28:45.475]  And again, we're affiliated with Summit, but that's Paul's site.
[00:28:45.475 --> 00:28:46.756]  Doing a great job over there.
[00:28:46.756 --> 00:28:48.678]  Same story posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:48.678 --> 00:28:49.779]  But Summit.News.
[00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:51.520]  Get it, and get it out.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.122]  Media predictions of tiny crowd for Trump July 4th.
[00:28:54.122 --> 00:28:56.804]  Speech proven spectacularly wrong!
[00:28:56.804 --> 00:28:57.325]  We'll be back.

[00:29:55.404 --> 00:29:57.985]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[00:30:01.958 --> 00:30:06.041]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:30:06.041 --> 00:30:09.222]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[00:30:09.222 --> 00:30:12.364]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[00:30:12.364 --> 00:30:24.591]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you could say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[00:30:24.591 --> 00:30:29.734]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[00:30:29.734 --> 00:30:30.975]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[00:30:31.015 --> 00:30:32.676]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:31:00.922 --> 00:31:02.302]  There is no longer any doubt.
[00:31:02.302 --> 00:31:08.183]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent, Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[00:31:08.183 --> 00:31:10.244]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[00:31:10.244 --> 00:31:11.824]  Already born babies are being killed.
[00:31:11.824 --> 00:31:12.964]  World government is here.
[00:31:12.964 --> 00:31:14.304]  Now is the time for decision.
[00:31:14.304 --> 00:31:17.365]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[00:31:17.365 --> 00:31:25.226]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag, and attacking the family, and that are attacking our borders, and our country, and our military, and our heritage.
[00:31:25.226 --> 00:31:27.587]  If you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[00:31:27.587 --> 00:31:29.607]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[00:31:29.847 --> 00:31:32.648]  And that means buying products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:32.648 --> 00:31:34.528]  And that means praying for InfoWars.
[00:31:34.528 --> 00:31:35.608]  And praying for President Trump.
[00:31:35.608 --> 00:31:36.528]  And praying for yourself.
[00:31:36.528 --> 00:31:37.589]  And praying for peace.
[00:31:37.589 --> 00:31:38.729]  Praying for justice.

[00:32:39.546 --> 00:32:40.967]  Potty's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:32:41.888 --> 00:32:43.709]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:32.375 --> 00:33:40.416]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, you are witnessing the rebirth of the American Republic back from the dead.
[00:33:40.416 --> 00:33:43.777]  1776 part two.
[00:33:43.777 --> 00:33:51.378]  This time it's worldwide.
[00:33:51.378 --> 00:34:01.640]  I ended up going fishing and hanging out at the lake with my family yesterday, and I didn't watch Trump's speech live, but I came in
[00:34:04.929 --> 00:34:21.779]  And I sat down and I had dinner and then all around me in the neighborhood, as it got dark, the fireworks went off and Trump's speech from about two hours before re-aired on C-SPAN.
[00:34:21.779 --> 00:34:30.224]  Now, I've been home for about an hour and I'd gone and I had looked at dozens of headlines on YouTube.
[00:34:30.224 --> 00:34:33.266]  I've turned on ABC, CNN, Fox.
[00:34:35.171 --> 00:34:38.272]  And it was all, well, was Trump right to do this?
[00:34:38.272 --> 00:34:46.813]  And, oh, critics say it's horrible, terrible speech, and Phil Mudd says it's a disgrace on CNN.
[00:34:46.813 --> 00:35:01.896]  But I noticed in all the comments for NBC and CBS on YouTube, every comment was, you're a disgrace, you hate America, you're undermining our president, you're pathetic, we see through you, I used to be a Democrat, now I'm not, every comment.
[00:35:01.896 --> 00:35:02.956]  And I sent these links
[00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.891]  To the producers last night, but guess what?
[00:35:06.891 --> 00:35:09.191]  They were gone.
[00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:12.412]  I went back to them last night and they were gone.
[00:35:12.412 --> 00:35:18.714]  CBS and NBC and others had pulled their YouTubes with headlines like critics.
[00:35:18.714 --> 00:35:21.255]  Here, I'll just pull it up for you right now.
[00:35:21.255 --> 00:35:24.616]  I can even show you the YouTube links which are now
[00:35:25.595 --> 00:35:27.196]  Dead, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:27.196 --> 00:35:29.018]  Now why is this so big?
[00:35:29.018 --> 00:35:42.809]  They know that their attack on 4th of July and their boldness and their attack on Trump when he didn't celebrate himself at all, celebrated America and our history and tried to bring us together.
[00:35:42.809 --> 00:35:46.912]  They know it's blowing up in their face.
[00:35:46.912 --> 00:35:51.476]  And they don't know what to do.
[00:35:51.476 --> 00:35:52.777]  Here it is, document cam shot please.
[00:35:54.414 --> 00:36:00.958]  Critics slam Trump's salute to America.
[00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:03.099]  Now, look at that.
[00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:10.384]  Critics slam Trump's salute to America.
[00:36:10.384 --> 00:36:17.068]  Now, what happens when you click that?
[00:36:17.068 --> 00:36:21.371]  The video has been removed by the user.
[00:36:21.371 --> 00:36:23.252]  You understand, I'm not just telling you this.
[00:36:24.966 --> 00:36:34.072]  So then, when I got in bed at about 10.30 at night, I lay awake for an hour with an iPad, and I went to over a hundred links.
[00:36:34.072 --> 00:36:35.513]  And I have screenshots.
[00:36:35.513 --> 00:36:40.056]  I may do a whole special report this week and show just this.
[00:36:40.056 --> 00:36:45.220]  Of a hundred plus hit pieces, over 70 were removed.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:46.261]  Now, what does that tell you?
[00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:49.383]  It shows the media is very centralized.
[00:36:49.383 --> 00:36:52.145]  Somebody's calling the shots.
[00:36:52.145 --> 00:36:53.806]  It had a total backlash.
[00:36:55.222 --> 00:37:06.070]  And so within three hours of when I saw it, I got in at about 7.15 or so.
[00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:08.571]  Trump had just finished his speech.
[00:37:08.571 --> 00:37:11.253]  The fireworks were coming up.
[00:37:11.253 --> 00:37:13.775]  I went, cooked dinner, hung out with the family.
[00:37:13.775 --> 00:37:19.159]  Michael Zimmerman was hanging out with us as well out of the lake house we were staying at.
[00:37:19.159 --> 00:37:22.441]  One of our crew was there with us.
[00:37:22.441 --> 00:37:24.803]  We had steak and chicken and it was great.
[00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:38.152]  He cooked on the grill and I went in there and started seeing all the hate pieces and then I'm getting messages back from the producers.
[00:37:38.152 --> 00:37:40.373]  These videos are dead.
[00:37:40.373 --> 00:37:42.174]  They killed him.
[00:37:42.174 --> 00:37:44.875]  Now, now, now, again, that's a Rosetta Stone.
[00:37:44.875 --> 00:37:46.736]  That's a window into all this.
[00:37:46.736 --> 00:37:49.457]  A fly on the wall.
[00:37:49.457 --> 00:37:50.278]  Boy, the hills have eyes.
[00:37:52.970 --> 00:38:15.841]  It's totally centralized and it backfired and they pulled it and how big a story is that in and of itself that I clicked on over a hundred headlines that were negative and mean from everything from Politico to the Washington Post to CNN to MSNBC to ABC News to NBC to CBS and they were all gone.
[00:38:15.841 --> 00:38:19.542]  When I say all the comments I probably only read 20-30 comments deep on 10 or 15 of them.
[00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:26.432]  But it was all the same.
[00:38:26.432 --> 00:38:37.336]  And I told the producers, I said, print off all these comments, and next time I've just got to print them then, because they're now just getting rid of the video, getting rid of the comments, because everyone is turning against them.
[00:38:37.336 --> 00:38:41.977]  We are reaching a collapse-level moment for the globalists.
[00:38:41.977 --> 00:38:43.998]  Now here's where I get frustrated.
[00:38:43.998 --> 00:38:47.519]  That's one little story of yesterday.
[00:38:47.519 --> 00:38:51.881]  I sat down this morning and wrote probably five pages of notes
[00:38:52.807 --> 00:38:55.008]  And then forgot and left it at the house.
[00:38:55.008 --> 00:38:59.049]  About angles I wanted to go with, and clips I wanted to play, and things I wanted to do.
[00:38:59.049 --> 00:39:01.790]  Because that's just one!
[00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:12.294]  Was how they were all negative, all pee in the speech, said it was the worst thing they had ever seen, and when everyone rejected it, they pulled it off YouTube.
[00:39:12.294 --> 00:39:13.974]  Who has the centralized control?
[00:39:13.974 --> 00:39:16.135]  How big a story is that?
[00:39:16.135 --> 00:39:17.956]  How that it was all rejected.
[00:39:17.956 --> 00:39:18.736]  How beautiful is that?
[00:39:20.626 --> 00:39:27.994]  And that's what's happening everywhere, and that's why they're in so much trouble.
[00:39:27.994 --> 00:39:30.898]  The only place that I saw that didn't pull all of them was CNN.
[00:39:30.898 --> 00:39:34.962]  They pulled some, saying it was a terrible speech and it was all about Trump.
[00:39:34.962 --> 00:39:37.585]  None of it was about Trump!
[00:39:37.585 --> 00:39:40.849]  So I saw CNN pull a few videos, but they didn't pull this one.
[00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:41.150]  Here it is.
[00:39:42.662 --> 00:39:43.362]  Well, let's see.
[00:39:43.362 --> 00:39:44.223]  Let me be subtle here.
[00:39:44.223 --> 00:39:47.605]  At a professional level, 25 years in national security, I hated it.
[00:39:47.605 --> 00:39:49.926]  At a personal level, I hated it more.
[00:39:49.926 --> 00:39:50.747]  Let me tell you something.
[00:39:50.747 --> 00:39:57.791]  When we're in the midst of July 4th, after 9-11, when I was at the CIA, I thought we were celebrating the defense of ideals.
[00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:59.752]  The right to live free and fair.
[00:39:59.752 --> 00:40:03.374]  The right to live according to those documents that our founding fathers established.
[00:40:03.374 --> 00:40:08.477]  The right of every person, every citizen in this country, to pretend like they can be president.
[00:40:08.857 --> 00:40:10.377]  The right to have economic opportunity.
[00:40:10.377 --> 00:40:14.558]  I didn't realize we were fighting for the chance to pay for guns, for weapons.
[00:40:14.558 --> 00:40:15.778]  I did national security.
[00:40:15.778 --> 00:40:20.680]  I thought this was about ideals, and now we've made it about the military.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:25.000]  It goes on, and I'll play it all later, but this is a guy that says they're going to kill the president.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:33.202]  He's related to the Virginian, the only other person convicted of killing Lincoln, Dr. Mudd.
[00:40:33.202 --> 00:40:34.983]  Your name is Mudd.
[00:40:34.983 --> 00:40:35.863]  This guy's incredible.
[00:40:39.372 --> 00:40:41.653]  It's Trump trying to pull us out of all these wars.
[00:40:41.653 --> 00:40:45.194]  It's Trump trying to do peace deals, not you, you little nasty neocon.
[00:40:45.194 --> 00:40:49.575]  Robert Mueller's protege, I should add, from the CIA into the FBI.
[00:40:49.575 --> 00:40:59.739]  We're going to go to break and come back with all of this, but I haven't hit the ritual Trump conducted yet, and I'm going to do it next segment.
[00:40:59.739 --> 00:41:07.241]  Come hook or crook, but it was absolutely incredible.
[00:41:07.241 --> 00:41:08.622]  Absolutely insane.
[00:41:11.809 --> 00:41:16.530]  That they're attacking it and it just really shows you the two different sides here.
[00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.011]  Crystal clear and confirms everything we always do about the left.
[00:41:19.011 --> 00:41:20.112]  They want our guns.
[00:41:20.112 --> 00:41:21.372]  They hate our country.
[00:41:21.372 --> 00:41:23.253]  They want to have sex with our children.
[00:41:23.253 --> 00:41:25.253]  They're just evil.
[00:41:25.253 --> 00:41:28.294]  And history shows that you go through these periods.
[00:41:28.294 --> 00:41:29.554]  We're going to go to break.
[00:41:29.554 --> 00:41:34.156]  This is the last few days of the Save Info Awards 4th of July mega special.
[00:41:35.177 --> 00:41:39.059]  It will be ending coming up on Sunday.
[00:41:39.059 --> 00:41:41.401]  We're going to have some new specials next week.
[00:41:41.401 --> 00:41:47.044]  We're going to launch a special week broadcast, a bunch of extra shows, either Wednesday or Thursday.
[00:41:47.044 --> 00:41:48.825]  We'll go for 36 hours live.
[00:41:48.825 --> 00:41:50.927]  I haven't decided yet, but I'll know about this afternoon.
[00:41:51.567 --> 00:41:55.090]  We're going to call that 1776 Worldwide Emergency Transmission.
[00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:56.171]  A lot of special guests.
[00:41:56.171 --> 00:41:59.374]  That's coming up next week because this is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:41:59.374 --> 00:42:13.787]  But right now we have the Save Info Wars Info Wars Live Special, 4th of July special, and that is storewide free shipping, double Patriot points in your next order, and 50% off all the supplements and a bunch of other specials that I almost forgot.
[00:42:15.543 --> 00:42:18.184]  We're able to get t-shirts printed and made in the U.S.
[00:42:18.184 --> 00:42:19.444]  within one week.
[00:42:19.444 --> 00:42:20.805]  They are being printed today.
[00:42:20.805 --> 00:42:22.526]  The design is done.
[00:42:22.526 --> 00:42:25.967]  We have the Betsy Ross flag shirts.
[00:42:25.967 --> 00:42:28.168]  Two different designs, two different colors.
[00:42:28.168 --> 00:42:30.189]  That's four different total shirts.
[00:42:30.189 --> 00:42:33.190]  Great red, white, and blue Betsy Ross flag on the front.
[00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:41.873]  Since 1776 on the front under it and on the back it says Infowars and above it America is back.
[00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:46.290]  Both on the blue shirt, the navy shirt, and the white shirt.
[00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:47.871]  So, four different shirts.
[00:42:47.871 --> 00:42:51.074]  They are collector's editions, just like The Clown World.
[00:42:51.074 --> 00:42:54.197]  We're only printing 4,000 of these, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:42:54.197 --> 00:42:56.980]  We're gonna trigger a libtard, an anti-American demon.
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:57.561]  This is the shirt.
[00:42:59.833 --> 00:43:15.739]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[00:43:15.739 --> 00:43:17.460]  It is completely independent of all that.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:28.324]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[00:43:28.544 --> 00:43:29.525]  We're good to go.
[00:43:48.533 --> 00:43:49.034]  I don't know.
[00:43:59.784 --> 00:44:02.365]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[00:44:02.365 --> 00:44:10.250]  We're going into the season of war and they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have through their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:13.912]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[00:44:13.912 --> 00:44:14.832]  We need to end here.
[00:44:14.832 --> 00:44:16.173]  We need to be provisioned.
[00:44:16.173 --> 00:44:20.435]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[00:44:20.755 --> 00:44:24.616]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[00:44:24.616 --> 00:44:26.517]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[00:44:26.517 --> 00:44:30.078]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[00:44:30.078 --> 00:44:31.519]  That just brings more people here.
[00:44:31.519 --> 00:44:34.820]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:35.660]  I need gas.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:37.161]  I need ammo politically now.
[00:44:37.581 --> 00:44:43.888]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[00:44:43.888 --> 00:44:45.009]  We're unstoppable together.
[00:44:45.009 --> 00:44:46.411]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:53.458]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[00:44:53.458 --> 00:44:54.439]  You have my commitment.
[00:44:54.439 --> 00:44:58.784]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[00:45:01.661 --> 00:45:05.805]  I want to encourage everyone to take advantage of the huge July 4th specials.
[00:45:05.805 --> 00:45:08.567]  We're running right through into next weekend, but then they've got to stop.
[00:45:08.567 --> 00:45:12.951]  Storewide free shipping, 50% off all the award-winning supplements, and double Patriot points.
[00:45:12.951 --> 00:45:17.094]  That means on your next order, 10% off, not 5% off on the dollar.
[00:45:17.094 --> 00:45:19.316]  Designed for auto shipping, an additional 10% off.
[00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:22.338]  Some of these products are lost leaders at those prices.
[00:45:22.338 --> 00:45:22.519]  X2.
[00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:24.220]  Learn about why it's so special.
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.381]  How is the good halogen?
[00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:26.922]  How is the missing link in the body?
[00:45:26.922 --> 00:45:28.984]  Find out about X2 at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:45:42.209 --> 00:45:44.710]  Most of those are close to selling out.
[00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.230]  Some won't be back in for months.
[00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:47.351]  Many won't be back in for weeks.
[00:45:47.631 --> 00:45:51.358]  Regardless, fish oil for adults, for children, the very best out there.
[00:45:51.358 --> 00:45:52.500]  All of these are great products.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.606]  Books, films, t-shirts, water filtration, air filtration.
[00:45:55.606 --> 00:45:58.892]  That's what funds the Infowar and the big sales running right now.
[00:45:58.892 --> 00:46:00.154]  InfowarStore.com
[00:46:01.454 --> 00:46:03.436]  Robert Moritz, what has Big Tech become?
[00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:05.458]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:11.963]  And the way they did so is because they faced no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[00:46:11.963 --> 00:46:24.054]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[00:46:24.054 --> 00:46:25.235]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[00:46:25.495 --> 00:46:27.857]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[00:46:55.435 --> 00:46:57.237]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[00:46:57.237 --> 00:46:59.159]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[00:46:59.159 --> 00:47:03.883]  Even it is what you just saw.
[00:47:03.883 --> 00:47:06.486]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:28.033]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:47:28.033 --> 00:47:30.574]  America is back!
[00:47:30.574 --> 00:47:35.015]  The bane of globalist, communist, kingpins and tyrants everywhere.
[00:47:35.015 --> 00:47:39.277]  And it stands in the way of their corporate world government and their beast system.
[00:47:40.737 --> 00:47:51.943]  President Trump invoked Christ and God and our covenant, our birthright, our inheritance, our providence.
[00:47:51.943 --> 00:48:00.687]  As thunderstorms raged and swirled around the city, it did not pour down during the key events.
[00:48:00.687 --> 00:48:07.611]  During Trump's speech, within minutes of him exiting the stage, it began to pour rain again.
[00:48:07.611 --> 00:48:08.732]  Stuff of legend.
[00:48:09.864 --> 00:48:12.185]  Just like during the inauguration.
[00:48:12.185 --> 00:48:15.245]  As soon as he was done, the rain began to pour.
[00:48:15.245 --> 00:48:17.486]  It's amazing.
[00:48:17.486 --> 00:48:21.326]  They tried to tell Trump to cancel it because it would look bad if it was pouring down right in the middle of it.
[00:48:21.326 --> 00:48:23.007]  He said, nope, we go ahead with it.
[00:48:23.007 --> 00:48:28.148]  And there was that giant crowd.
[00:48:28.148 --> 00:48:30.048]  Some estimate a million.
[00:48:30.048 --> 00:48:31.389]  Many couldn't even get into there.
[00:48:31.389 --> 00:48:33.769]  Hundreds of thousands of them all.
[00:48:33.769 --> 00:48:37.190]  And CNN was running crop photos just like three years ago at the inauguration.
[00:48:38.351 --> 00:48:41.833]  Saying there were small crowds there and huge demonstrations.
[00:48:41.833 --> 00:48:52.398]  Our reporters have video of only 20 people at the anti-Trump demonstration wearing communist shirts and the little stupid Trump balloon that the media focused on.
[00:48:52.398 --> 00:48:57.620]  But here is the battle hymn for the Republic.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:49:01.562]  And if you watch this video at the live streams at Infowars.com forward slash show,
[00:49:02.796 --> 00:49:09.097]  And if you see this, you see Melania with tears in her eyes and breathing and her chest rising.
[00:49:09.097 --> 00:49:11.578]  You see Trump about to break down crying.
[00:49:11.578 --> 00:49:15.679]  He also did it earlier when he talked about American innovation and going to the stars.
[00:49:15.679 --> 00:49:22.101]  You can see how much they love seeing America come back from the dead and stopping the demoralization of the people.
[00:49:22.101 --> 00:49:23.001]  So let's start rolling.
[00:49:23.001 --> 00:49:28.182]  Battle Hymn of the Republic, a Christian song, triggering the left massively.
[00:49:43.308 --> 00:49:43.629]  We're good.
[00:49:58.324 --> 00:50:03.247]  We're good to go.
[00:50:19.718 --> 00:50:20.198]  We're good to go.
[00:50:50.299 --> 00:50:53.684]  And again, by the end of it, it continues on.
[00:50:53.684 --> 00:51:03.517]  And then after the song's over, as they're breaking up and the final jets are flying over, Trump is totally focused.
[00:51:03.517 --> 00:51:04.738]  Body language is off the chart.
[00:51:05.886 --> 00:51:17.330]  And he almost staggers off the stage, and you've got the polonium just beaming, the amount of emotion, the amount of focus, perfectly executed event.
[00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:21.551]  Remember, just seeing American flags makes the left run in fear.
[00:51:21.551 --> 00:51:24.272]  Only the last four years or so did this become complete.
[00:51:24.272 --> 00:51:32.175]  It was always there, but I learned it, like, globalist events and things, and the events attacking me that they had downtown called
[00:51:33.395 --> 00:51:34.356]  Trump and Alex Jones.
[00:51:34.356 --> 00:51:35.617]  The city held.
[00:51:35.617 --> 00:51:37.899]  When I showed up, I said, it's okay to love America.
[00:51:37.899 --> 00:51:38.940]  America's back.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:39.881]  We should all come together.
[00:51:39.881 --> 00:51:59.678]  They went, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[00:52:01.761 --> 00:52:04.423]  Just good old-fashioned Americana.
[00:52:04.423 --> 00:52:06.685]  If the country wasn't in so much trouble, it'd be kind of cheesy.
[00:52:06.685 --> 00:52:14.752]  Until you realize how many people fought and died for this nation, that the globalists want to conquer it and make us hate ourselves, and only tell us about the bad things in our past.
[00:52:14.752 --> 00:52:17.974]  Like Betsy Ross was a famous abolitionist.
[00:52:17.974 --> 00:52:19.416]  She made the first American flag.
[00:52:19.416 --> 00:52:20.516]  She designed it.
[00:52:20.516 --> 00:52:21.397]  In her head.
[00:52:21.397 --> 00:52:21.677]  Boom.
[00:52:21.677 --> 00:52:21.998]  Made it.
[00:52:21.998 --> 00:52:23.979]  It's the most recognizable flag in the world.
[00:52:23.979 --> 00:52:25.100]  It's beautiful.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:27.262]  She's an abolitionist.
[00:52:27.262 --> 00:52:29.023]  Thomas Jefferson wanted to be an abolitionist.
[00:52:29.909 --> 00:52:31.870]  But the point is, they say, oh, it's from the past!
[00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:34.232]  It's bad, you can't have it!
[00:52:34.232 --> 00:52:46.441]  It's sick!
[00:52:46.441 --> 00:52:50.344]  See, the beauty.
[00:52:50.344 --> 00:52:51.965]  Christ was born.
[00:52:51.965 --> 00:52:52.746]  Ooh, they hate that.
[00:52:55.925 --> 00:53:24.668]  With a glory in his bosom That transfigures you and me As he dies to make men holy Let us die to make men free While God is marching on
[00:53:29.335 --> 00:53:30.075]  That's it.
[00:53:30.075 --> 00:53:31.536]  Go full screw with Melania.
[00:53:31.536 --> 00:53:33.276]  She is in ecstasy right there.
[00:53:33.276 --> 00:53:34.416]  That's the part.
[00:53:34.416 --> 00:53:37.137]  She starts getting tears in her eyes.
[00:53:37.137 --> 00:53:38.878]  Trump, you see a tear.
[00:53:38.878 --> 00:53:41.558]  If you watch on HD, I went up right to the TV and looked at it.
[00:53:41.558 --> 00:53:45.799]  Tears coming out of his eyes.
[00:53:45.799 --> 00:53:47.720]  Knowing that we're defeating the globalists with God's help.
[00:53:49.502 --> 00:53:51.945]  There's Trump squeezing back tears.
[00:53:51.945 --> 00:53:57.571]  He did it a couple times, even more intense during the speech.
[00:53:57.571 --> 00:54:01.035]  Look at Melania, she is, that's the opposite of a power trip look.
[00:54:01.035 --> 00:54:02.937]  That is a real Christian right there.
[00:54:02.937 --> 00:54:10.066]  Realizing that we are invoking God against the evil, standing against, like when she spontaneously broke out with the Lord's Prayer a few years ago.
[00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:23.211]  And again, America isn't perfect, but the evil hates it.
[00:54:23.211 --> 00:54:26.872]  It wants to control it and use it for world domination.
[00:54:26.872 --> 00:54:27.892]  And the answer is no.
[00:54:27.892 --> 00:54:28.992]  F-18s fly over.
[00:54:28.992 --> 00:54:34.754]  Trump is in just absolute heaven.
[00:54:34.754 --> 00:54:37.695]  Because he knows how much the globalists hate this country.
[00:54:37.695 --> 00:54:40.856]  And hate him and hate us.
[00:54:40.856 --> 00:54:43.236]  And then this song.
[00:54:43.236 --> 00:54:44.637]  And they say it's cheesy.
[00:54:44.637 --> 00:54:46.297]  What are you gonna do, move to North Korea?
[00:54:46.297 --> 00:54:48.358]  Or maybe Europe?
[00:54:50.151 --> 00:54:51.711]  We're one of the only countries we can own guns.
[00:54:51.711 --> 00:54:53.932]  We're the only countries we can really own your property.
[00:54:53.932 --> 00:54:57.252]  And yeah, we've lost a lot of it.
[00:54:57.252 --> 00:54:58.513]  But you know what?
[00:54:58.513 --> 00:54:59.573]  We're gonna take it back.
[00:54:59.573 --> 00:55:03.274]  That's right.
[00:55:03.274 --> 00:55:07.515]  Once they take your pride and your country away, they've got you.
[00:55:07.515 --> 00:55:09.195]  You know what's taken the country over?
[00:55:09.195 --> 00:55:09.895]  World government.
[00:55:09.895 --> 00:55:11.635]  Ruthless megabanks.
[00:55:11.635 --> 00:55:13.636]  That have exploited the third world.
[00:55:13.636 --> 00:55:14.676]  Not us.
[00:55:14.676 --> 00:55:15.256]  And now... 50 years.
[00:55:20.095 --> 00:55:27.104]  Globalism is being reversed, like flushing a big toilet filled with leftist scum.
[00:55:27.104 --> 00:55:32.951]  Let's go full screen with this.
[00:55:32.951 --> 00:55:35.894]  Again, this is literally an exorcism of the left.
[00:55:35.894 --> 00:55:37.036]  We're moving them.
[00:55:37.036 --> 00:55:37.897]  Get behind me, Satan!
[00:55:37.897 --> 00:55:39.219]  In the name of Jesus Christ!
[00:55:41.278 --> 00:55:57.769]  From the lakes of Minnesota To the hills of Tennessee Across the plains of Texas From sea to shining sea From Detroit down to Houston And New York to L.A.
[00:55:57.769 --> 00:56:03.973]  With this pride in every American heart It's time we stand and say
[00:56:10.103 --> 00:56:12.024]  Yeah, you can say people overdo the Americana.
[00:56:12.024 --> 00:56:13.305]  I thought that, too, when I was growing up.
[00:56:13.305 --> 00:56:14.046]  You know, I loved America.
[00:56:14.046 --> 00:56:16.027]  I thought, what is this America and this Texas stuff?
[00:56:16.027 --> 00:56:22.572]  Until you realize there's people that want to take it over and replace it with stuff absolutely evil.
[00:56:22.572 --> 00:56:23.733]  They want our children.
[00:56:23.733 --> 00:56:24.814]  They want our property.
[00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:25.694]  They want our guns.
[00:56:25.694 --> 00:56:26.635]  They want our souls.
[00:56:26.635 --> 00:56:27.716]  They want our names.
[00:56:27.716 --> 00:56:28.597]  They want our genetics.
[00:56:28.597 --> 00:56:29.877]  They want our seed.
[00:56:29.877 --> 00:56:31.158]  They want our soul.
[00:56:31.158 --> 00:56:32.700]  They're not going to get it.
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.662]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to get more into this second hour.
[00:56:35.662 --> 00:56:37.123]  We have a bunch of special guests in studio.
[00:56:38.163 --> 00:56:41.444]  But I've got so many of these clips we haven't played yet.
[00:56:41.444 --> 00:56:45.025]  This was amazing, but I know body language when I see it.
[00:56:45.025 --> 00:56:47.746]  From the military personnel to the crowds.
[00:56:47.746 --> 00:56:50.047]  I was watching it in HD, man.
[00:56:50.047 --> 00:56:52.308]  And it was the people were coming together.
[00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:59.811]  This was a healing ritual with Christ's name being said at least 10 times while I was watching, invoking that holy name.
[00:56:59.811 --> 00:57:03.252]  Above all other names, the enemy is convulsing.
[00:57:04.568 --> 00:57:14.531]  And remember, they pulled 70 plus videos that I went and looked at with headlines trashing Trump and the United States.
[00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:21.614]  It backfired and somebody said, this isn't working, pull it, pull it, pull it.
[00:57:21.614 --> 00:57:24.555]  All of your plans will be defeated in the end.
[00:57:24.555 --> 00:57:28.216]  All the weapons you form against us will not prosper enemies.
[00:57:28.216 --> 00:57:29.556]  Know that.
[00:57:29.556 --> 00:57:30.957]  Know that you called for war.
[00:57:32.242 --> 00:57:34.864]  Now you shall reap the whirlwind, Globalist.
[00:57:34.864 --> 00:57:37.766]  Remember, we are listed and supported only by you.
[00:57:37.766 --> 00:57:39.226]  Can we continue on?
[00:57:39.226 --> 00:57:41.368]  And we have the new Betsy Ross.
[00:57:41.368 --> 00:57:42.729]  These colors don't run.
[00:57:42.729 --> 00:57:43.889]  America's Back.
[00:57:43.889 --> 00:57:44.890]  InfoWars shirts.
[00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:45.811]  Limited edition.
[00:57:45.811 --> 00:57:47.612]  Fund the M4 and get a great shirt.
[00:57:50.168 --> 00:57:51.228]  The time has come.
[00:57:51.228 --> 00:57:52.208]  The time is here.
[00:57:52.208 --> 00:58:04.231]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:11.393]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status.
[00:58:11.573 --> 00:58:12.414]  And the U.N.
[00:58:12.414 --> 00:58:16.617]  and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the U.S.
[00:58:16.617 --> 00:58:24.002]  to collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism, so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela.
[00:58:24.002 --> 00:58:24.983]  This is a plan.
[00:58:24.983 --> 00:58:26.144]  That's why we've got to stay on air.
[00:58:26.144 --> 00:58:28.646]  It's why you've got to keep fighting, because we're going to win this in the end.
[00:58:28.806 --> 00:58:31.930]  Thanks to you and your support, that's what makes it all possible.
[00:58:31.930 --> 00:58:37.976]  So I salute you, and I thank you, but I ask you again, do your shopping with us, and we will continue on in the face of this.
[00:58:37.976 --> 00:58:49.069]  InfoWareStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, whatever you do, commit now to history, and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalists.
[00:58:51.173 --> 00:58:55.297]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:58:55.297 --> 00:59:05.708]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[00:59:05.708 --> 00:59:08.851]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale.
[00:59:09.011 --> 00:59:09.291]  I'm good.
[00:59:25.143 --> 00:59:42.912]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:49.615]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[00:59:53.328 --> 01:00:00.995]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.995 --> 01:00:01.476]  July 5th, 2019.
[01:00:01.476 --> 01:00:02.637]  Hour number two just kicked off.
[01:00:02.637 --> 01:00:03.698]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.698 --> 01:00:05.960]  You can certainly mark your calendars yesterday.
[01:00:20.975 --> 01:00:29.502]  Back on January 20th, 2017, I said, mark your calendars.
[01:00:29.502 --> 01:00:31.164]  Trump's gonna deliver or die trying.
[01:00:31.164 --> 01:00:32.265]  This guy's for real.
[01:00:32.265 --> 01:00:38.209]  And I'm more sure of Trump now than I've ever been.
[01:00:38.209 --> 01:00:38.770]  Trump's 100% for real.
[01:00:41.164 --> 01:00:50.551]  He's like one of those people that comes from a Christian background, but doesn't go to church a lot, but loves God, but thinks of mainline Christians as kind of hypocrites.
[01:00:50.551 --> 01:00:53.613]  But Melania is a very deep Christian that's well known.
[01:00:53.613 --> 01:00:57.576]  And she's gotten him on the straight and narrow, let me tell you.
[01:00:57.576 --> 01:01:01.639]  And he's really matured at 73 years old.
[01:01:01.639 --> 01:01:03.321]  He's really matured the last six, seven years.
[01:01:03.321 --> 01:01:05.062]  He said that during the campaign.
[01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:07.163]  He says, listen, I've changed a lot.
[01:01:07.163 --> 01:01:07.844]  I've grown a lot.
[01:01:09.492 --> 01:01:16.093]  And I've talked to a lot of preachers that prayed with Trump, and I've talked to folks that are very close to Trump.
[01:01:16.093 --> 01:01:24.395]  And he's had a real Christian conversion from being a Christian to really being one.
[01:01:24.395 --> 01:01:28.015]  And, you know, as they say in the cheesy Star Wars, the force is with him.
[01:01:28.015 --> 01:01:31.836]  Holy Spirit's with him because of Melania Trump, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:31.836 --> 01:01:35.797]  And there's no doubt the enemy is pulling their hair out.
[01:01:35.797 --> 01:01:37.817]  They do not know what to do.
[01:01:38.942 --> 01:01:41.524]  And see, Trump is into energy.
[01:01:41.524 --> 01:01:44.066]  And so in stuffy, fake churches and things, he never felt it.
[01:01:44.066 --> 01:01:48.149]  But in black churches, and in southern churches, and in others.
[01:01:48.149 --> 01:01:49.350]  I had a conversation with Trump.
[01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.852]  He brings it up about the energy at that event.
[01:01:51.852 --> 01:01:52.713]  It was like a church.
[01:01:52.713 --> 01:01:55.715]  It's way better than a rock concert.
[01:01:55.715 --> 01:01:56.616]  The energy, the spirit.
[01:01:56.616 --> 01:01:57.216]  You feel it all?
[01:01:57.216 --> 01:01:57.657]  Yes, I do.
[01:01:57.657 --> 01:01:58.937]  Yes, sir, I feel the spirit.
[01:01:58.937 --> 01:02:00.279]  You feel the spirit get stronger, don't you?
[01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.489]  We're good.
[01:02:22.594 --> 01:02:35.128]  I was driving in from the Hill Country out at the lake to my house this morning and it really hit me that I should just go ahead and tell folks, but this is a spiritual war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:38.882 --> 01:02:47.831]  You know, I used to think I was crazy when I was a little kid because you don't really call it the visions, it's just a knowing of a job you've got to do.
[01:02:47.831 --> 01:02:52.255]  And then never even, as you get older, even thinking about what you thought when you were a kid.
[01:02:52.255 --> 01:02:58.582]  And then once you're in college and things like that, forgetting when you were young, like four or five, six years old, God telling you you have a mission.
[01:02:59.182 --> 01:03:08.711]  And then envisioning what was going to happen, and then later it happens, and you look back and you say, that wasn't like Oprah Winfrey's The Secret, where you just say something and it magically happens.
[01:03:08.711 --> 01:03:19.882]  It's all about destiny, and providence, and bloodlines, and backgrounds, and ongoing wars, and God's plan, and providence, and you step into that.
[01:03:19.882 --> 01:03:21.884]  It's not that God's making things happen.
[01:03:22.725 --> 01:03:31.077]  God's put forward these different future roads, and then you've got to choose the path you're going to go on, but the paths are predestined.
[01:03:32.503 --> 01:03:37.506]  People always get confused by Calvinist saying it's predestined but we have faith and we have free will.
[01:03:37.506 --> 01:03:40.428]  Well it's predestined if you take that road.
[01:03:40.428 --> 01:03:41.988]  And I just, it's incredible.
[01:03:41.988 --> 01:03:44.210]  I took the road of my ancestors.
[01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:45.390]  We've taken this road.
[01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:46.931]  You've taken this road.
[01:03:46.931 --> 01:03:48.732]  And Trump has taken the road.
[01:03:48.732 --> 01:03:49.833]  And it's real.
[01:03:49.833 --> 01:03:54.556]  And we have the keys to hell and death because of Jesus Christ.
[01:03:54.556 --> 01:03:56.637]  And we have power over Satan.
[01:03:58.319 --> 01:04:00.520]  But we have to exercise it.
[01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.760]  And Satan knows that.
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:05.121]  And Satan's very real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:05.121 --> 01:04:06.442]  Again, look at the planet.
[01:04:06.442 --> 01:04:08.282]  Look at the sun in the sky.
[01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:09.363]  All this stuff going on.
[01:04:09.363 --> 01:04:16.025]  All these evil people that go out of their way to hurt kids and poison people and demoralize and do bad things.
[01:04:16.025 --> 01:04:17.966]  And you look at how fallen these armies are.
[01:04:19.301 --> 01:04:24.225]  I looked up the New York Times writers that say America sucks, and I looked up the Vox writers that say it sucked.
[01:04:24.225 --> 01:04:33.712]  I spent a lot of time the last few days, and Paul Watson wrote about it, from fullwars.com and newswars.com, and you look at what these people look like, I'm going to show you some of them.
[01:04:33.712 --> 01:04:37.655]  I mean, if you were walking down a dark alley, you'd go the other direction if you saw all these people.
[01:04:37.655 --> 01:04:47.022]  It physically manifests, not that they got a wart on their nose or a hunchback, but that they physically radiate evil.
[01:04:49.352 --> 01:04:53.098]  It's all real, heaven and hell, interdimensional war, it's all here.
[01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:58.927]  Trump knows it, and we are all in it.
[01:04:58.927 --> 01:05:03.794]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:05:05.091 --> 01:05:14.496]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:05:14.496 --> 01:05:26.142]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:05:26.142 --> 01:05:30.324]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:05:31.244 --> 01:05:35.267]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:05:35.267 --> 01:05:42.171]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:45.093]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[01:05:45.093 --> 01:05:55.239]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:09.263]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:09.263 --> 01:06:19.847]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday worldwide broadcast.
[01:06:19.847 --> 01:06:20.647]  Melania Trump,
[01:06:34.707 --> 01:06:36.669]  Tears in her eyes.
[01:06:36.669 --> 01:06:45.981]  In ecstasy to see the country relaunched and evil now facing a renewed spirit of liberty and justice and love of Christ.
[01:06:45.981 --> 01:06:47.582]  Her lips trembling.
[01:06:47.582 --> 01:06:51.227]  Her eyes on fire with liberty and the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:51.227 --> 01:06:52.689]  Trump next to his wife feeling it.
[01:06:53.985 --> 01:07:06.246]  Having to purse his lips and hold back tears, and you look at HD, a tear comes out of his eye, knowing that they've tried to defy this nation, tried to crush it, tried to tear it apart, tried to conquer our souls, but they have failed.
[01:07:07.025 --> 01:07:10.026]  That's what you're watching on screen.
[01:07:10.026 --> 01:07:26.894]  And we have worked so hard, all of us together, old, young, black, white, from all over the world, 1776 worldwide, the renaissance against the globalists, the renaissance against the empires, the tyrants, the renaissance against those that want centralized systems of control.
[01:07:26.894 --> 01:07:31.916]  America is fighting back for its life.
[01:07:31.916 --> 01:07:35.058]  Evils try to take us over because we're so powerful, because we had God,
[01:07:37.014 --> 01:07:40.135]  I've seen Trevor Melania in ecstasy.
[01:07:40.135 --> 01:07:41.956]  Not on a power trip ruling over people.
[01:07:41.956 --> 01:07:46.557]  Not with a demonic glow in their eyes like the Clintons or the Obamas.
[01:07:46.557 --> 01:07:49.898]  The evil chip on their shoulder.
[01:07:49.898 --> 01:07:50.498]  No.
[01:07:50.498 --> 01:07:57.340]  But a feeling of strength and coming together and building a future to the stars and innovation.
[01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.521]  Was there ever any question about Trump?
[01:08:00.649 --> 01:08:07.090]  However, any question about InfoWars, you know, ladies and gentlemen, by the enemy's response, we're real.
[01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:12.572]  Oh, we're sinners, we're not perfect, but we understand America's destiny.
[01:08:12.572 --> 01:08:20.413]  We understand that to let the Republic fall and let the globalists take over is a fate worse than death.
[01:08:20.413 --> 01:08:24.974]  I'm glad to stand up.
[01:08:24.974 --> 01:08:27.495]  Next to you, it's all of us together.
[01:08:29.509 --> 01:08:31.050]  No doubt, my friends.
[01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:35.674]  God bless the United States.
[01:08:35.674 --> 01:08:40.958]  That the Chinese flood with enough fentanyl to kill everybody.
[01:08:40.958 --> 01:08:43.720]  That Hollywood bombards with the nastiest poison ever seen.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:48.243]  Because America had most of the innovation in the world.
[01:08:48.243 --> 01:08:52.767]  And we're known all over the planet as the nicest, hardest-working people.
[01:08:52.767 --> 01:08:57.871]  The best literature, the best art, the best machines, the best ships, the best science, the best medicine.
[01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:01.216]  The most honorable people you can count on.
[01:09:01.216 --> 01:09:03.397]  And now look what we've become.
[01:09:03.397 --> 01:09:09.461]  A satanic, overrun system that kills its babies after they're born.
[01:09:09.461 --> 01:09:10.021]  Well guess what?
[01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:12.543]  We're gonna turn the tide against evil.
[01:09:12.543 --> 01:09:14.884]  And evil knows it.
[01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:19.306]  And so they're pouring out their evil upon us right now, hoping we just get overwhelmed and give up.
[01:09:19.306 --> 01:09:20.427]  Hoping to demoralize us.
[01:09:20.427 --> 01:09:23.269]  But the tide is turning.
[01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:27.011]  And last night, I heard the enemy's back break even more!
[01:09:28.311 --> 01:09:33.355]  I don't have x-ray vision to look into their soul, but I can tell you they're falling right now.
[01:09:33.355 --> 01:09:34.956]  It's going to be rough.
[01:09:34.956 --> 01:09:38.119]  Human clones and Chimera has already walked the streets.
[01:09:38.119 --> 01:09:40.181]  World government's been established.
[01:09:40.181 --> 01:09:46.546]  They're already setting up systems to take full control and Trump is blind to many things like 5G and other things.
[01:09:46.546 --> 01:09:49.248]  But in the end, we're establishing the country again.
[01:09:49.248 --> 01:09:51.150]  We're exposing the globalists.
[01:09:51.150 --> 01:09:53.372]  We're empowering the people.
[01:09:53.372 --> 01:09:55.974]  And we are identifying the enemies like the left.
[01:09:56.889 --> 01:10:00.590]  And so the tide is turned.
[01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:21.336]  And when you think about how the choice is so simple between the left that loves world government, that is allied with the chi-coms, that hates our families, that hates God, that hates independence, and that tells us that we suck, and that humans should roll over to die, and that humans are a disease, that's what the globalists are projecting onto you, what they think you are.
[01:10:21.336 --> 01:10:24.817]  Because in their own hearts, that's what they are.
[01:10:24.817 --> 01:10:25.337]  Powerful.
[01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.742]  And I'm just honored to be here with you.
[01:10:28.742 --> 01:10:30.843]  Let's go to some of these clips.
[01:10:30.843 --> 01:10:34.146]  Trump, when he got into John Paul Jones, got very, very emotional.
[01:10:34.146 --> 01:10:37.148]  When he got into the military, he got very, very emotional.
[01:10:37.148 --> 01:10:51.559]  But he spent even more time talking about our soldiers fighting and dying in the Civil War to try to right slavery, and leading the world against tyranny, and all of our innovations, and having respect for ourselves and our shared experiences.
[01:10:52.429 --> 01:10:58.112]  Here's the President on the founder of the US Navy, John Paul Jones.
[01:10:58.112 --> 01:11:11.699]  In October of 1775, the Continental Congress ordered the construction of two swift sailing vessels, each carrying 10 cannons and 80 men to sail eastward.
[01:11:11.699 --> 01:11:15.481]  Our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful Navy.
[01:11:16.257 --> 01:11:18.719]  The world has ever seen.
[01:11:18.719 --> 01:11:30.309]  John Paul Jones, America's first great naval hero, said, I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for I intend to go in harm's way.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:42.366]  He got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns.
[01:11:42.366 --> 01:11:49.791]  When demanded to surrender, Jones very famously declared, I have not yet begun to fight.
[01:11:59.099 --> 01:12:05.185]  When our Navy begins fighting, they finish the job.
[01:12:05.185 --> 01:12:08.708]  You know, I said I was going to start that new podcast show on Saturday.
[01:12:08.708 --> 01:12:11.611]  We've got to line up all the callers, because it's going to be a show about callers.
[01:12:11.611 --> 01:12:15.715]  Two hours, I think, starting every Saturday, and then I'll let them start hosting it themselves.
[01:12:17.056 --> 01:12:34.223]  I'm gonna do that next week because this weekend, I haven't chosen the time, we need to come in and play the whole speech and stop it and start it and analyze it because it's his biggest speech, it's his most powerful speech, and again, it's got the globalists shaking to their very core.
[01:12:34.223 --> 01:12:40.445]  And again, if they can get us to give up our birthright and to hate ourselves, they've won.
[01:12:40.445 --> 01:12:43.386]  If they can get us to hate our unborn babies, they've won.
[01:12:43.386 --> 01:12:45.167]  Or our little babies after they're born, they've won.
[01:12:47.253 --> 01:12:50.394]  And I knew the Democrats were run by Satanists and pedophiles at the top.
[01:12:50.394 --> 01:12:52.655]  They're part of the globalist system.
[01:12:52.655 --> 01:12:54.336]  They're predators.
[01:12:54.336 --> 01:12:57.457]  But I want to explain something.
[01:12:57.457 --> 01:13:00.658]  Whenever we would say that, oh, the Democrats hate America, they go, oh, you're picking and choosing.
[01:13:00.658 --> 01:13:02.178]  You're cherry picking.
[01:13:02.178 --> 01:13:06.520]  And I see that talking point on InfoWars by the establishment commenters.
[01:13:08.152 --> 01:13:12.656]  Oh, Jones is focusing on the extreme, saying the left hates America.
[01:13:12.656 --> 01:13:15.459]  I have hundreds of articles the last few days saying they hate America.
[01:13:15.459 --> 01:13:19.583]  Hundreds of news clips, I can't even watch them all, saying it.
[01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:21.465]  No, you do hate America.
[01:13:21.465 --> 01:13:24.407]  And by the way, you do want our guns.
[01:13:24.407 --> 01:13:27.010]  Almost every Democratic candidate has said, we're just going to confiscate them.
[01:13:28.268 --> 01:13:31.731]  And they have New York Times front page story saying, time to repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:13:31.731 --> 01:13:33.112]  You want our guns?
[01:13:33.112 --> 01:13:34.653]  You support pedophilia?
[01:13:34.653 --> 01:13:36.034]  You want open borders?
[01:13:36.034 --> 01:13:38.576]  You think everybody should come here and get free stuff and bankrupt us?
[01:13:38.576 --> 01:13:39.376]  It's official!
[01:13:39.376 --> 01:13:43.379]  You are what we said you were.
[01:13:43.379 --> 01:13:50.765]  I read their own documents, I tracked what the foundations were pushing, what the globalists wanted, and people are like, oh that'll never happen, they'll never get that.
[01:13:50.765 --> 01:13:51.405]  Well you know what?
[01:13:51.405 --> 01:13:56.068]  They're sure as you know what trying.
[01:13:56.068 --> 01:13:56.189]  Now,
[01:13:57.369 --> 01:14:01.532]  Folks, we are launching another limited edition right now.
[01:14:01.532 --> 01:14:02.593]  T-shirt.
[01:14:02.593 --> 01:14:05.414]  We're only going to have 4,000 of these.
[01:14:05.414 --> 01:14:06.575]  There's four different variants.
[01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:10.778]  Two different shirts in white and in navy blue.
[01:14:10.778 --> 01:14:12.759]  I'm very excited about it.
[01:14:12.759 --> 01:14:15.041]  It is the Betsy Ross flag.
[01:14:15.041 --> 01:14:18.703]  The first flag made by an abolitionist.
[01:14:18.703 --> 01:14:20.064]  Made by an American.
[01:14:20.064 --> 01:14:21.205]  She came up with the design.
[01:14:21.205 --> 01:14:22.166]  It's a beautiful flag.
[01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:25.188]  One of the most recognizable in history, if not world history.
[01:14:26.047 --> 01:14:32.012]  And it's a white shirt on the front that has the flag in red, white, and blue right across the chest, big.
[01:14:32.012 --> 01:14:37.276]  And then under it, it says, these colors don't run.
[01:14:37.276 --> 01:14:42.380]  On the back, it says, America is back.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:45.143]  Infowars.com.
[01:14:45.143 --> 01:14:51.147]  There's another variant that says, the Betsy Ross flag, established 1776.
[01:14:53.379 --> 01:14:58.062]  And on the back, it says America's Back in FullWars.com.
[01:14:58.062 --> 01:15:01.083]  So, two different variants, two different colors.
[01:15:01.083 --> 01:15:02.384]  That's four shirts.
[01:15:02.384 --> 01:15:05.485]  We're printing a thousand of each.
[01:15:05.485 --> 01:15:08.587]  The order was put in yesterday.
[01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:11.649]  The place where they make them in America is printing them now.
[01:15:11.649 --> 01:15:14.010]  They'll be shipped to us by next week.
[01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.271]  Two weeks for delivery.
[01:15:15.271 --> 01:15:17.572]  So get your Betsy Ross

[01:15:57.613 --> 01:15:58.874]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.874 --> 01:16:00.175]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.175 --> 01:16:03.918]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.918 --> 01:16:04.999]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:06.821]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:08.542]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:27.048 --> 01:16:33.410]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:36.430]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:42.352]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:46.153]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.153 --> 01:16:47.413]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.413 --> 01:16:48.413]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.413 --> 01:16:54.955]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:54.955 --> 01:16:56.395]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.327 --> 01:16:59.288]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.288 --> 01:17:04.611]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.611 --> 01:17:06.192]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.192 --> 01:17:14.557]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.557 --> 01:17:20.241]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:20.421 --> 01:17:22.242]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:22.242 --> 01:17:24.503]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.503 --> 01:17:28.904]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.904 --> 01:17:31.085]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[01:17:59.138 --> 01:18:11.174]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this, and we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[01:18:11.174 --> 01:18:14.038]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:15.059]  I don't know.
[01:18:33.835 --> 01:18:34.796]  I like to be expanding.
[01:18:34.796 --> 01:18:35.576]  I like to be winning.
[01:18:35.576 --> 01:18:36.297]  I like to be fighting.
[01:18:36.297 --> 01:18:37.478]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[01:18:37.478 --> 01:18:38.359]  That's why we're so hated.
[01:18:38.359 --> 01:18:39.980]  But we need to be retreaded.
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:41.181]  We need to be tuned up.
[01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:42.242]  We need to be fixed up.
[01:18:42.242 --> 01:18:43.563]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[01:18:43.563 --> 01:18:45.124]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[01:18:45.124 --> 01:18:49.948]  And if the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[01:18:49.948 --> 01:18:51.949]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[01:18:51.949 --> 01:18:56.252]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor, funded by foreign banks and the Tricom.
[01:18:56.252 --> 01:18:57.894]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[01:18:58.314 --> 01:19:04.035]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[01:20:01.327 --> 01:20:03.941]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.287 --> 01:20:29.216]  I don't know about you, but Melania Trump just continues to impress.
[01:20:29.216 --> 01:20:30.778]  A real lady.
[01:20:30.778 --> 01:20:31.419]  A real powerhouse.
[01:20:38.326 --> 01:20:41.709]  You know what Margaret Thatcher said?
[01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:44.312]  If somebody's got to tell you they're a lady, they're not.
[01:20:44.312 --> 01:20:49.516]  Tears in her eyes.
[01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:51.518]  Seeing the reboot of America.
[01:20:51.518 --> 01:20:56.283]  Seeing the America haters that have run this country down, having it rub in their face.
[01:20:56.283 --> 01:20:57.163]  Seeing the people come together.
[01:20:58.024 --> 01:20:59.244]  Look at Trump, tears in his eyes.
[01:20:59.244 --> 01:21:03.085]  That's what it's all about!
[01:21:03.085 --> 01:21:07.626]  That's what it's about 18 hours a day when he kills himself to attack the enemy.
[01:21:07.626 --> 01:21:10.547]  Because he's got so much energy flowing through him, he can't help it.
[01:21:10.547 --> 01:21:11.347]  This is it, folks.
[01:21:11.347 --> 01:21:14.227]  America won't be killed as easily as they thought.
[01:21:14.227 --> 01:21:14.828]  What does AOC do?
[01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:16.488]  What does Hillary do?
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.281]  What does CNN do?
[01:21:28.281 --> 01:21:32.185]  They lie, and they lie, and they lie, and they cheat.
[01:21:32.185 --> 01:21:35.588]  And now, they'll do anything.
[01:21:35.588 --> 01:21:37.110]  They'll do anything.
[01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:39.752]  But people know they're liars.
[01:21:39.752 --> 01:21:45.858]  What was so exciting, as I said last night, is I typed in Trump into YouTube.
[01:21:47.077 --> 01:22:03.645]  And every video for 10 pages deep was vicious attacks with headlines like critics say it was terrible, Trump's horrible, Trump made it all about himself, public hate suits, small crowds, and I clicked on dozens of them.
[01:22:03.645 --> 01:22:06.847]  I looked at the comments and every comment on the ones I clicked was just
[01:22:08.027 --> 01:22:08.528]  I'm done.
[01:22:08.528 --> 01:22:09.469]  You're pathetic.
[01:22:09.469 --> 01:22:11.451]  This was a great event.
[01:22:11.451 --> 01:22:12.512]  He didn't make it about himself.
[01:22:12.512 --> 01:22:13.813]  It made it about all of us coming together.
[01:22:13.813 --> 01:22:15.175]  I'm so proud of my country.
[01:22:15.175 --> 01:22:18.198]  You know, I used to be a liberal, but now I learned they really do hate America.
[01:22:18.198 --> 01:22:19.860]  They want us all to hate each other, to control us.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:25.086]  I mean, the comments were all on fire!
[01:22:25.086 --> 01:22:28.469]  There were videos with 5,000 views, like the CBS one I showed you.
[01:22:29.309 --> 01:22:32.451]  Before they took it down, and there'd be 10,000 comments.
[01:22:32.451 --> 01:22:37.394]  And I looked at page after page after page, and I clicked the next one, and I just clicked the next one.
[01:22:37.394 --> 01:22:42.236]  They're like, hey, the steaks are ready.
[01:22:42.236 --> 01:22:43.337]  You understand?
[01:22:43.337 --> 01:22:46.999]  No one's buying their crap!
[01:22:46.999 --> 01:22:53.463]  Except people... like this guy.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:23:02.785]  I've got a stack of censorship news of us and others being censored.
[01:23:02.785 --> 01:23:12.512]  And I've got a stack of the type of people that hate America.
[01:23:12.512 --> 01:23:18.857]  And when you look at these people, they look so evil.
[01:23:18.857 --> 01:23:22.920]  Like when you see the Hillside Strangler, and he looks totally satanic.
[01:23:23.951 --> 01:23:25.853]  And you're like, my God, that guy's demon possessed.
[01:23:25.853 --> 01:23:28.895]  And he turns his hand around, there's a pentagram in it.
[01:23:28.895 --> 01:23:34.960]  Evil people who are demonically possessed look like jack-o'-lanterns.
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:40.324]  And I want to show you some of these individuals.
[01:23:40.324 --> 01:23:41.885]  I've got so many of these.
[01:23:41.885 --> 01:23:46.609]  Can you guys pull up the headline from newswars.com or infowars.com?
[01:23:46.609 --> 01:23:50.372]  It's, what's his name?
[01:23:50.372 --> 01:23:53.395]  Vox reporter says the US would have been better off
[01:23:55.293 --> 01:23:56.933]  Staying with England.
[01:23:56.933 --> 01:24:00.114]  And you look at the guy.
[01:24:00.114 --> 01:24:02.395]  And you look at what he's saying.
[01:24:02.395 --> 01:24:04.976]  Yeah, look at this guy.
[01:24:04.976 --> 01:24:06.496]  Look at this guy.
[01:24:06.496 --> 01:24:11.218]  Now, Vox celebrates Fourth of July by saying the American Revolution was a mistake.
[01:24:11.218 --> 01:24:12.878]  Let me explain something.
[01:24:12.878 --> 01:24:17.379]  Every reporter they've had on me from BuzzFeed or any of these places looks like this.
[01:24:17.379 --> 01:24:18.340]  Whether it's a woman or a man.
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:19.160]  Put him back on screen, please.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.401]  And blow up his face for people.
[01:24:22.401 --> 01:24:25.404]  He's got a face that's more evil than Brian Stelter's.
[01:24:25.404 --> 01:24:29.427]  Full screen, please.
[01:24:29.427 --> 01:24:36.092]  Now, think about that.
[01:24:36.092 --> 01:24:42.056]  And you look at him, he's got this satisfied, evil, creepy, dirty, oily look.
[01:24:42.056 --> 01:24:43.998]  And then I googled his name in more photos.
[01:24:43.998 --> 01:24:48.762]  Each one looks more creepy after the next.
[01:24:48.762 --> 01:24:50.363]  The disingenuousness of him.
[01:24:54.608 --> 01:25:01.455]  And again, this is a guy on July 4th telling you how much America sucks.
[01:25:01.455 --> 01:25:04.879]  And you wouldn't let that guy clean your toilets.
[01:25:04.879 --> 01:25:06.440]  You wouldn't let him work on your pool.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.424]  You wouldn't let him get anywhere near your children.
[01:25:10.424 --> 01:25:17.452]  I mean, he's ready to be in Hellraiser without makeup.
[01:25:17.452 --> 01:25:17.852]  Look at him.
[01:25:20.359 --> 01:25:27.205]  And these are the people that hate civilization and hate society and want to just pull it all down and wreck it.
[01:25:27.205 --> 01:25:31.809]  When I find the stack I'm going to get to it because I've got a whole stack of news here.
[01:25:31.809 --> 01:25:35.492]  Take Caitlin Bennett.
[01:25:35.492 --> 01:25:42.258]  Take Caitlin Bennett.
[01:25:42.258 --> 01:25:45.501]  Yeah, I mean, there he is.
[01:25:45.501 --> 01:25:46.322]  Take Caitlin Bennett.
[01:25:49.278 --> 01:25:55.343]  Seven months ago she posted a photo of herself wearing an InfoWars.com t-shirt.
[01:25:55.343 --> 01:25:56.464]  Facebook owns Instagram.
[01:25:56.464 --> 01:25:57.765]  They took it down on July 4th.
[01:25:57.765 --> 01:26:04.230]  There's a picture of her with an American flag behind her and the InfoWars In Your Face t-shirt.
[01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:07.152]  Which is just bright red on a navy blue background.
[01:26:07.152 --> 01:26:12.136]  And they told her, you do that again, we're going to take you off of Instagram.
[01:26:12.136 --> 01:26:17.581]  It's a thought crime, but they said two months ago you can't say Alex Jones's name or have a positive mention of InfoWars.
[01:26:20.745 --> 01:26:21.666]  How Orwellian is that?
[01:26:21.666 --> 01:26:24.348]  And people say, oh Alex, it's okay, you'll still sell your shirts.
[01:26:24.348 --> 01:26:26.210]  It's not about me selling shirts.
[01:26:26.210 --> 01:26:39.222]  It's about the fact they have AI scanning computers, scanning the internet, and if they find photos, they're telling everybody and their dog to take down InfoWars, and now they're saying they want the American flag taken down.
[01:26:39.222 --> 01:26:41.243]  And they want the Betsy Ross flag taken down.
[01:26:41.243 --> 01:26:43.906]  And Nike took it off!
[01:26:43.906 --> 01:26:45.067]  That's where this is going.
[01:26:45.067 --> 01:26:46.008]  And the Chinese government
[01:26:47.093 --> 01:26:51.134]  Wants Winnie the Pooh taken down, because the Chinese make fun of the leader as Winnie the Pooh.
[01:26:51.134 --> 01:26:53.495]  They say he talks like Winnie the Pooh.
[01:26:53.495 --> 01:26:54.695]  In Chinese.
[01:26:54.695 --> 01:26:56.756]  And oh, now they don't want Taiwanese flags.
[01:26:56.756 --> 01:26:59.437]  So Apple and Google are complying to not have those.
[01:26:59.437 --> 01:27:03.698]  You see, it's InfoWars today.
[01:27:03.698 --> 01:27:05.418]  It's everything else tomorrow.
[01:27:05.418 --> 01:27:08.399]  Here's some of the articles on censorship.
[01:27:08.399 --> 01:27:14.581]  Wikipedia co-founder slams Zuckerberg, big tech, for appalling internet censorship.
[01:27:16.155 --> 01:27:17.755]  Says they can control what you see.
[01:27:17.755 --> 01:27:19.156]  And he says they're censoring everybody.
[01:27:19.156 --> 01:27:20.736]  They're creating a whole false reality.
[01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:21.777]  This isn't an internet.
[01:27:21.777 --> 01:27:24.337]  This is a captive internet.
[01:27:24.337 --> 01:27:25.538]  InfoWars.com.
[01:27:25.538 --> 01:27:25.958]  Here it is.
[01:27:25.958 --> 01:27:31.639]  Instagram removes American flag photo because it showed InfoWars t-shirt.
[01:27:31.639 --> 01:27:33.160]  Again, InfoWars.com.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:36.120]  NewsWars.com.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:39.381]  Teen who said there are only two genders expelled from school.
[01:27:39.381 --> 01:27:40.522]  GoFundMe shut down.
[01:27:40.522 --> 01:27:41.702]  We're going to show you that video.
[01:27:43.837 --> 01:27:47.719]  Big Pharma now with Big Tech won't allow any criticism of any of their drugs.
[01:27:47.719 --> 01:27:52.261]  If anybody gets hurt, you can't say any drug hurt you in a consumer report.
[01:27:52.261 --> 01:27:56.443]  They're basically banning Yelp.
[01:27:56.443 --> 01:28:00.965]  The same Communist Party group that sued me after flag burning in Cleveland.
[01:28:00.965 --> 01:28:03.306]  The suit got thrown out, by the way.
[01:28:03.306 --> 01:28:05.347]  Never heard about that in the news, though.
[01:28:05.347 --> 01:28:07.348]  They sued me when I wasn't even there.
[01:28:09.957 --> 01:28:17.779]  Well, they're the same group that lit one up, was flinging it around, and they got arrested for the dangerous thing they did, not for burning the flag.
[01:28:17.779 --> 01:28:20.399]  That's all up on Infowars.com.
[01:28:20.399 --> 01:28:25.481]  Oh, and France now moves to make companies block hate speech worldwide, AP.
[01:28:25.481 --> 01:28:31.322]  See, because Trump won't act to say you can't censor Americans, France is coming into the vacuum.
[01:28:31.322 --> 01:28:32.002]  That's coming up.
[01:28:32.002 --> 01:28:34.623]  We're going to take your calls as well.
[01:28:34.623 --> 01:28:36.263]  Leo Zegami's here.
[01:28:36.263 --> 01:28:38.944]  More clips of the president.
[01:28:39.804 --> 01:28:47.315]  And so much more, but whatever you do, get the article out showing how huge the crowd was and the media saying it wasn't large.
[01:28:47.315 --> 01:28:51.521]  It's at InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and DrudgeReport.com.
[01:28:51.521 --> 01:28:52.843]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:52.843 --> 01:28:53.584]  America's back.
[01:28:57.921 --> 01:29:08.964]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.
[01:29:08.964 --> 01:29:14.765]  Because now, Sunny Bay heating wraps and pillows are available at both Amazon and Walmart.
[01:29:14.765 --> 01:29:15.405]  Yes!

[01:29:59.201 --> 01:30:15.748]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are, and how they were the best, and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[01:30:15.868 --> 01:30:19.971]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down.
[01:30:19.971 --> 01:30:23.613]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they work.
[01:30:23.613 --> 01:30:25.414]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[01:30:25.414 --> 01:30:29.637]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[01:30:29.637 --> 01:30:37.562]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[01:30:37.602 --> 01:30:40.303]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[01:30:40.303 --> 01:30:45.206]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:46.386]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[01:30:46.386 --> 01:30:47.367]  They have side effects.
[01:30:47.367 --> 01:30:48.267]  Not with Mother Nature.
[01:30:48.267 --> 01:30:51.969]  But Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:30:51.969 --> 01:30:53.850]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:31:00.018 --> 01:31:04.120]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:04.120 --> 01:31:10.443]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[01:31:10.443 --> 01:31:22.650]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:27.732]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:29.033]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[01:31:29.053 --> 01:31:30.733]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.501]  The time has come.
[01:32:00.501 --> 01:32:01.482]  The time is here.
[01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:13.512]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world could come here and get everything free, but that we, the citizens, have to pay for it.
[01:32:13.512 --> 01:32:25.622]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status, and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the U.S.
[01:32:25.882 --> 01:32:33.269]  To collapse the countries, to kill capitalism and bring in socialism so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea and Venezuela.
[01:32:33.269 --> 01:32:34.250]  This is a plan.
[01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:35.411]  That's why we've got to stay on air.
[01:32:35.411 --> 01:32:38.073]  It's why you've got to keep fighting because we're going to win this in the end.
[01:32:38.073 --> 01:32:39.775]  Thanks to you and your support.
[01:32:39.775 --> 01:32:41.196]  That's what makes it all possible.
[01:32:41.196 --> 01:32:42.798]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[01:32:42.798 --> 01:32:47.022]  But I ask you again, do your shopping with us and we will continue on the face of this.
[01:32:47.242 --> 01:32:51.786]  Infowarestore.com, 50% off, store-bought free shipping, double patriot points.

[01:33:01.333 --> 01:33:08.739]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:08.739 --> 01:33:11.181]  Now!
[01:33:11.181 --> 01:33:12.503]  They think you're a goldfish!
[01:33:14.142 --> 01:33:16.504]  I've been betting on you my whole life!
[01:33:16.504 --> 01:33:18.005]  I believe in you!
[01:33:18.005 --> 01:33:20.928]  I don't think you're stupid!
[01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:24.130]  One man ever raped a woman!
[01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:25.972]  All genitals were cut off!
[01:33:25.972 --> 01:33:28.534]  And we're kicking these traitors' asses politically!
[01:33:28.534 --> 01:33:31.676]  And we're not backing down ever!
[01:33:31.676 --> 01:33:32.857]  I wanna get these people!
[01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:33.438]  We're winning!
[01:33:33.438 --> 01:33:34.679]  I can feel the spirit rising!
[01:33:34.679 --> 01:33:35.419]  Can't you?
[01:33:35.419 --> 01:33:37.441]  We have broken their back!
[01:33:37.441 --> 01:33:42.445]  Yes, I can feel it!
[01:33:42.445 --> 01:33:42.985]  Let's go!
[01:33:44.372 --> 01:33:44.813]  Come on!
[01:33:44.813 --> 01:33:45.153]  Come on!
[01:33:45.153 --> 01:33:45.373]  Come on!
[01:33:45.373 --> 01:33:45.673]  Come on!
[01:33:45.673 --> 01:33:45.834]  Come on!
[01:33:45.834 --> 01:33:46.234]  Come on!
[01:33:46.234 --> 01:33:46.534]  Come on!
[01:33:46.534 --> 01:33:46.875]  Come on!
[01:33:46.875 --> 01:33:47.135]  Come on!
[01:33:47.135 --> 01:33:47.355]  Come on!
[01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:47.715]  Come on!
[01:33:47.715 --> 01:33:48.116]  Come on!
[01:33:48.116 --> 01:33:48.336]  Come on!
[01:33:48.336 --> 01:33:48.516]  Come on!
[01:33:48.516 --> 01:33:48.777]  Come on!
[01:33:48.777 --> 01:33:48.997]  Come on!
[01:33:48.997 --> 01:33:49.397]  Come on!
[01:33:49.397 --> 01:33:49.617]  Come on!

[01:34:01.950 --> 01:34:02.170]  Come on!
[01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:02.430]  Come on!
[01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:02.690]  Come on!
[01:34:02.690 --> 01:34:02.991]  Come on!
[01:34:02.991 --> 01:34:03.231]  Come on!
[01:34:03.231 --> 01:34:03.571]  Come on!
[01:34:03.571 --> 01:34:03.752]  Come on!
[01:34:03.752 --> 01:34:03.992]  Come on!
[01:34:03.992 --> 01:34:04.312]  Come on!
[01:34:04.312 --> 01:34:04.552]  Come on!
[01:34:04.552 --> 01:34:04.712]  Come on!
[01:34:04.712 --> 01:34:04.893]  Come on!
[01:34:04.893 --> 01:34:05.193]  Come on
[01:34:09.056 --> 01:34:17.959]  Infowars was the detonator.
[01:34:17.959 --> 01:34:20.179]  Relaunch America.
[01:34:20.179 --> 01:34:22.400]  1776 worldwide.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:24.901]  We did it.
[01:34:24.901 --> 01:34:27.202]  The fight's just begun, but we did it.
[01:34:35.675 --> 01:34:38.177]  I got a feeling we're going to win this war with Christ's help.
[01:34:38.177 --> 01:34:45.321]  Leo Zagami is a best-selling author, researcher, and real expert on the inner workings of the Vatican, P2 Lodge, Masons, and so much more.
[01:34:45.321 --> 01:34:47.142]  He's riding shotgun with us into the fourth hour.
[01:34:47.142 --> 01:34:48.923]  Paul Watson joins us as well.
[01:34:48.923 --> 01:34:52.085]  Robert Barnes is going to spend about a week a month with us here.
[01:34:53.205 --> 01:34:57.627]  He's leaving today, but he'll be with us some in the fourth hour and third hour as well.
[01:34:57.627 --> 01:35:02.050]  But I want to get more into these clips from Trump, get Leo Zegami's take on how historic this is.
[01:35:02.050 --> 01:35:16.217]  But it's kind of fitting that Leo came here Wednesday and he said, I brought you a bottle of champagne that was very expensive on all the news in Italy when Trump won three years ago.
[01:35:17.317 --> 01:35:20.200]  And so he brought me a bottle of it.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:23.542]  In fact, the decorative box is right over there on that desk.
[01:35:23.542 --> 01:35:26.584]  If somebody could bring it to me out of the dark over there.
[01:35:26.584 --> 01:35:28.806]  And I was kind of like, well, what are we going to celebrate?
[01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:30.627]  Well, just the fact that Trump's in there.
[01:35:30.627 --> 01:35:43.337]  But now that after this 4th of July speech, that's his biggest yet, the way the left demonized it, lied about it, said it was all about him when it wasn't, how well it was received while they're trying to ban the American flag and, you know, trying to do all of this.
[01:35:43.997 --> 01:35:46.558]  This is a very good time to celebrate.
[01:35:46.558 --> 01:35:50.799]  So I don't normally have champagne, you know, at 1230 noon.
[01:35:50.799 --> 01:35:53.200]  I actually don't really drink much these days.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:59.842]  But in celebration of this, I am more than happy to do this with Leo Zegami and his lovely wife, who's here in a minute.
[01:35:59.842 --> 01:36:01.103]  Philip, come up and share out of your glass.
[01:36:01.103 --> 01:36:03.804]  I've only got two glasses here, Leo Zegami.
[01:36:03.804 --> 01:36:07.045]  But what would you call this historical time we're in right now?
[01:36:07.873 --> 01:36:10.375]  It's a time of real renaissance.
[01:36:10.375 --> 01:36:15.259]  It's a time of getting back what was taken from us.
[01:36:15.259 --> 01:36:21.443]  And we were, in Italy, the first organization to believe in Trump before he became president.
[01:36:21.443 --> 01:36:24.185]  Four years ago, when he was first running, I met with you in Italy again.
[01:36:24.185 --> 01:36:25.907]  You said he's going to win.
[01:36:25.907 --> 01:36:27.828]  He's like Berlusconi, who I know you're friends with.
[01:36:27.828 --> 01:36:28.829]  And you were explaining it all to me.
[01:36:29.229 --> 01:36:37.434]  Yeah and I hope he doesn't make any compromises that unfortunately Berlusconi in the end had to make and that is the only thing I fear.
[01:36:37.434 --> 01:36:46.480]  But at the moment he's actually delivering what he promised and so I'm very happy to bring this bottle which was presented to the Italian press on the 20th of January 2017.
[01:36:48.181 --> 01:36:53.746]  In Palazzo Ferraioli and in front of the American Embassy at the Galleria Sallustiana.
[01:36:53.746 --> 01:37:02.854]  This bottle which is handcrafted by the master glass makers in Venice with a layman of gold on top of it.
[01:37:02.854 --> 01:37:08.138]  It is a very complicated process to make it and each bottle is handcrafted differently.
[01:37:08.138 --> 01:37:10.140]  And so it was the perfect gift.
[01:37:10.140 --> 01:37:11.021]  It was never opened.
[01:37:11.141 --> 01:37:20.148]  We presented to the press on the 24th of January 2017, Alex, and everybody in Italy had seen it, but the bottle stayed intact.
[01:37:20.148 --> 01:37:30.956]  So now we are about to open it to celebrate finally this great moment of American renaissance that, thanks to Donald J. Trump, yesterday we had.
[01:37:30.956 --> 01:37:33.838]  By the way, I've been interviewing you for over 10 years, none of your work for six
[01:37:34.518 --> 01:37:37.179]  17, 18 years, read a lot of your books and thought, well, this can't be true.
[01:37:37.179 --> 01:37:41.781]  But then everything you predicted came true about how you'd have two popes, how they start serving terms.
[01:37:41.781 --> 01:37:42.981]  Now they're announcing that.
[01:37:42.981 --> 01:37:48.223]  I mean, you got your finger on the pulse and you were able to give a special tours of the Vatican because it's corrupt.
[01:37:48.223 --> 01:37:50.244]  A lot of people in it don't like what's happening.
[01:37:50.244 --> 01:37:51.904]  So there's different factions.
[01:37:51.904 --> 01:37:53.505]  So so there's not many bottles of this.
[01:37:53.985 --> 01:38:07.595]  No, and the guy who presented with me to the press is Antonio Maria Rinaldi, who is now the Economist of the League, has been elected to the European Parliament, and so he's the most popular guy after Salvini in Italy, Antonio Maria Rinaldi.
[01:38:07.595 --> 01:38:16.201]  And I'm glad that we can bring you this gift to demonstrate that there is some true patriots also in Italy.
[01:38:16.201 --> 01:38:17.802]  Tell me about the company itself.
[01:38:18.442 --> 01:38:21.406]  Well, of course, this is a company that makes luxury bottles only.
[01:38:21.406 --> 01:38:23.569]  A bottle like this costs 2,000 euros.
[01:38:23.569 --> 01:38:26.133]  That means approximately 2,500 dollars.
[01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:27.114]  Wow.
[01:38:27.114 --> 01:38:32.882]  So, we are about to open a very expensive bottle which I advise you to keep for posterity because... Oh, I will.
[01:38:32.882 --> 01:38:34.845]  I've never had a 2,000 bottle of anything.
[01:38:36.457 --> 01:38:40.002]  I don't think $100 is fancy for me at a wedding or something.
[01:38:40.002 --> 01:38:41.383]  All right, well this is a big deal.
[01:38:41.383 --> 01:38:52.257]  And I have to thank also the people at the Fiumicino Airport, my friend Andrea Signini who came to pick us up outside of the airport and brought us through the VIP line so we could avoid any control.
[01:38:53.078 --> 01:38:55.402]  That's right, because you're not allowed to bring liquor or alcohol into a country.
[01:38:55.402 --> 01:39:02.452]  Well, especially a luxury thing like a brand like this one, because if you go and check on the internet the name of this brand, which is Maurice Tricot.
[01:39:02.452 --> 01:39:05.056]  So quite a journey to get this here to us.
[01:39:05.056 --> 01:39:05.737]  Yes, yes.
[01:39:05.737 --> 01:39:06.157]  Wow.
[01:39:06.157 --> 01:39:07.139]  It was worth it.
[01:39:07.139 --> 01:39:08.781]  One bottle of this, that's all that exists.
[01:39:08.781 --> 01:39:09.142]  That's it.
[01:39:09.650 --> 01:39:10.671]  Well, thank you.
[01:39:10.671 --> 01:39:13.992]  All right, well, we've got to have your wife drink out of this first, here.
[01:39:13.992 --> 01:39:14.773]  So let's get her up here.
[01:39:14.773 --> 01:39:15.593]  Tell us who this lady is.
[01:39:15.593 --> 01:39:17.134]  They've been with her for a long time.
[01:39:17.134 --> 01:39:27.679]  It's Christie, my wife, who has endured a lot of hardships back in Italy with my persecution, of course.
[01:39:27.679 --> 01:39:29.460]  And we know the left-wing judiciary.
[01:39:29.460 --> 01:39:30.360]  They've sued you.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.221]  They've arrested you.
[01:39:31.221 --> 01:39:32.321]  Same stuff they're doing to me.
[01:39:32.321 --> 01:39:32.882]  Same stuff.
[01:39:32.882 --> 01:39:34.302]  And in the end, I gave up, though.
[01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:35.243]  I just fled the country.
[01:39:35.765 --> 01:39:38.986]  Come on up here, sweetheart, with your husband.
[01:39:38.986 --> 01:39:40.286]  Stand right beside him.
[01:39:40.286 --> 01:39:41.406]  This is Christy.
[01:39:41.406 --> 01:39:43.227]  Let's do a wide shot, guys.
[01:39:43.227 --> 01:39:46.847]  I don't want to scare the dog, but I'm going to pop the champagne, okay?
[01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:56.970]  Here's to the renaissance worldwide against the globalists, to nationalism, Christianity, to the family, and to just all basic, classical things that we know are good and work.
[01:39:56.970 --> 01:40:02.731]  Here's to men, here's to women, here's to families, here's to children, here is to God, number one, and Jesus Christ, his son.
[01:40:03.988 --> 01:40:05.089]  There you go.
[01:40:05.089 --> 01:40:08.231]  All right.
[01:40:08.231 --> 01:40:08.771]  This is good.
[01:40:08.771 --> 01:40:10.812]  After yesterday's speech, I feel like some champagne.
[01:40:10.812 --> 01:40:11.552]  Yeah.
[01:40:11.552 --> 01:40:12.713]  Here you go, beautiful.
[01:40:12.713 --> 01:40:13.554]  Thank you.
[01:40:13.554 --> 01:40:15.095]  You bet.
[01:40:15.095 --> 01:40:17.196]  Me and Chris are going to share a glass together.
[01:40:17.196 --> 01:40:18.777]  I should have thought for three glasses.
[01:40:18.777 --> 01:40:19.637]  No worries.
[01:40:19.637 --> 01:40:20.318]  No worries.
[01:40:20.318 --> 01:40:24.120]  And again, folks, a celebration to all of you out there and making it all possible.
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.401]  Cheers.
[01:40:25.401 --> 01:40:25.941]  Salute.
[01:40:25.941 --> 01:40:27.522]  Here's to victory.
[01:40:27.522 --> 01:40:28.442]  Victory.
[01:40:28.442 --> 01:40:28.963]  You drink it first.
[01:40:33.884 --> 01:40:34.984]  How is it, Alex?
[01:40:34.984 --> 01:40:35.884]  It's a Francia Corta.
[01:40:35.884 --> 01:40:37.445]  That's the best champagne I ever drank.
[01:40:37.445 --> 01:40:37.885]  Yeah?
[01:40:37.885 --> 01:40:39.286]  It's actually worth all that money?
[01:40:39.286 --> 01:40:40.847]  I don't know, man.
[01:40:40.847 --> 01:40:42.587]  It was in the refrigerator, not even cold enough.
[01:40:42.587 --> 01:40:43.388]  It should have been in ice.
[01:40:43.388 --> 01:40:44.808]  I'm not just lying.
[01:40:44.808 --> 01:40:52.051]  It's super brute and dry, but with an incredible mixed sweet flavor at the end.
[01:40:52.051 --> 01:40:53.372]  This is unbelievable.
[01:40:53.372 --> 01:40:53.932]  It's nice.
[01:40:53.932 --> 01:40:54.392]  Very nice.
[01:40:54.392 --> 01:40:56.193]  A Francia Corta.
[01:40:56.193 --> 01:40:57.834]  Wow, it's also rich!
[01:40:59.235 --> 01:41:03.938]  I've never had, I know it's only champagne, but it's from France, I've never had a sparkling wine this good.
[01:41:03.938 --> 01:41:06.100]  This is a... Almost like you get what you pay for.
[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:17.228]  Well... Most of the time, unfortunately, this kind of sparkling wines from Maurice Rico go in the hands of the mega-rich, you know, the billionaires.
[01:41:17.228 --> 01:41:19.029]  This is what the globalists are drinking on those yachts.
[01:41:19.029 --> 01:41:21.611]  Yes, that's what they're... but this time... God bless you, brother.
[01:41:22.478 --> 01:41:23.380]  Here's to President Trump.
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:24.903]  Oh, and Melania.
[01:41:24.903 --> 01:41:28.530]  Gee, boy, I want her to run for president.
[01:41:28.530 --> 01:41:33.039]  Let's repeal the amendment that foreign-born can't be president for her.
[01:41:33.039 --> 01:41:34.342]  But have it the amendment only for her.
[01:41:36.387 --> 01:41:49.698]  I'm very glad to be here with my wife that shares with Melania the fact that they are both ex-models and so it's a coincidence but also we like fine ladies.
[01:41:49.698 --> 01:41:54.842]  And you have also a fine wife which I met when you were not even, I think, married yet.
[01:41:55.722 --> 01:42:02.926]  So, that was a great opportunity for me to meet your wife in the making, because she was a very nice lady.
[01:42:02.926 --> 01:42:16.554]  So, I thank you very much for coming to Rome back then, because you actually inspired Italians for Trump and Trampiani d'Italia to take the first step in putting together a project with Giuliano Ferramonti, Alfredo Esposito and Antonio Maria Rinaldi.
[01:42:16.554 --> 01:42:21.676]  And now Brexit and Trump has inspired a nationalist anti-globalist who's now your president?
[01:42:21.676 --> 01:42:21.956]  Yes.
[01:42:21.956 --> 01:42:23.317]  He's leading the fight to break up the Euro.
[01:42:25.138 --> 01:42:40.408]  To break up the Euro and Antonio Maria Rinaldi, the Economist of the League, is one of the key people who is trying to put together an alternative currency or some other alternative ways of escaping the Euro-technocratic imposition.
[01:42:57.879 --> 01:42:59.899]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[01:42:59.899 --> 01:43:01.920]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies.
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:08.422]  And the way they did so is because they face no consequence, social, economic, political, or legal, for their illicit activities over two decades.
[01:43:08.422 --> 01:43:20.506]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[01:43:20.506 --> 01:43:21.686]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:31.633]  And they'll become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trusts of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[01:43:31.633 --> 01:43:42.280]  The Infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:49.105]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[01:43:50.005 --> 01:43:53.686]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[01:43:53.686 --> 01:43:55.607]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[01:43:55.607 --> 01:43:57.787]  Even it is what you just saw.
[01:43:57.787 --> 01:43:59.648]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget.
[01:43:59.648 --> 01:44:00.928]  This is the maximum alert.
[01:44:00.928 --> 01:44:02.068]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[01:44:02.068 --> 01:44:03.489]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[01:44:03.489 --> 01:44:05.109]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight.
[01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:09.770]  We need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:11.571]  You want to just give us straight donations.

[01:44:13.431 --> 01:44:15.232]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[01:44:15.232 --> 01:44:16.712]  We need money to fight back.
[01:44:16.852 --> 01:44:19.534]  And to let them know we're taking action and to defend ourselves.

[01:44:37.907 --> 01:44:41.969]  We're getting a lot of support right now, but we need a lot to go into this dark night.
[01:44:41.969 --> 01:44:43.009]  We're not going to back down.
[01:44:59.111 --> 01:45:15.004]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:45:15.004 --> 01:45:16.705]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:45:16.705 --> 01:45:27.594]  It is an old-school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the country, they actually tried to
[01:45:27.794 --> 01:45:28.775]  We're good to go.
[01:45:59.015 --> 01:46:01.618]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[01:46:01.618 --> 01:46:09.505]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[01:46:09.505 --> 01:46:13.168]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[01:46:13.168 --> 01:46:14.089]  We need to end here.
[01:46:14.089 --> 01:46:16.131]  We need to be provisioned, and you've got mine.
[01:46:16.311 --> 01:46:19.992]  Total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[01:46:19.992 --> 01:46:23.854]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[01:46:23.854 --> 01:46:25.774]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[01:46:25.774 --> 01:46:29.335]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies.
[01:46:29.335 --> 01:46:30.756]  That just brings more people here.
[01:46:30.756 --> 01:46:34.077]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[01:46:34.077 --> 01:46:34.917]  I need gas.
[01:46:34.917 --> 01:46:36.438]  I need ammo politically now.
[01:46:36.838 --> 01:46:44.262]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable, we're unstoppable together.
[01:46:44.262 --> 01:46:45.662]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[01:46:45.662 --> 01:46:52.686]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing, and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[01:46:52.686 --> 01:46:53.666]  You have my commitment.
[01:46:53.666 --> 01:47:00.789]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[01:47:00.789 --> 01:47:03.431]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.897 --> 01:47:22.807]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:47:27.415 --> 01:47:35.723]  Well, the crew is in there enjoying the rest of the champagne, and they tried it, and Daria and others agreed, best champagne they've ever had.
[01:47:35.723 --> 01:47:40.488]  We don't normally drink on the job, but I think between eight or nine of us, we can all have a half a glass.
[01:47:40.488 --> 01:47:42.370]  Leo Zagami, you and your wife, awesome folks.
[01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:43.932]  I want to get into meat and potatoes now.
[01:47:45.856 --> 01:47:52.319]  And also take some calls in the next hour, specifically on Trump's Fourth of July speech, the insane lapis response.
[01:47:52.319 --> 01:47:55.920]  Leo Zegami, again, best-selling author from Italy, now here in the U.S.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:59.342]  as an exile, a real exile, a real political prisoner, escaped.
[01:48:03.925 --> 01:48:11.873]  I don't know if you've been able to follow it, but the left literally attacks the 4th of July, attacks the American flag, says America sucks.
[01:48:11.873 --> 01:48:21.222]  There should be a bigger backlash against these people, but when you look at all the comments in newspapers and on YouTube, everyone is against them and saying, how dare you?
[01:48:21.222 --> 01:48:26.207]  And I noticed all these videos got pulled by CBS, ABC, NBC attacking Trump.
[01:48:26.827 --> 01:48:31.809]  And I'm tagging the 4th of July, I think they realize that they've gone too far.
[01:48:31.809 --> 01:48:34.350]  What would you call this hating of your own nation?
[01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:41.512]  I know the globalists are doing it to get us ready to get rid of our sovereignty, just like the Euro tells people to hate their countries inside Europe.
[01:48:41.512 --> 01:48:42.152]  U.S.
[01:48:42.152 --> 01:48:43.953]  used to be the greatest democracy.
[01:48:43.953 --> 01:48:49.175]  With this, of course, you have two parties and they oppose each other in a democratic way.
[01:48:49.175 --> 01:48:51.395]  But now they went too far.
[01:48:51.395 --> 01:48:54.857]  And so they criticize the essence of America.
[01:48:54.857 --> 01:48:56.097]  And that's not right, Alex.
[01:48:56.277 --> 01:49:06.402]  Because they're criticizing even the declaration of independence ended up as a hate speech at one point on Facebook.
[01:49:06.402 --> 01:49:14.747]  I mean, we are in a situation whereby the left wing has lost the plot and wants to transform the United States of America in a socialist...
[01:49:15.387 --> 01:49:17.389]  slash communist country.
[01:49:17.389 --> 01:49:23.876]  And this is not America, used to say a song back in the days by, I remember, David Bowie and Pat Metheny.
[01:49:23.876 --> 01:49:28.000]  Definitely this is not America the way it was born.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.963]  So I hope that they realize they went too far.
[01:49:30.963 --> 01:49:33.325]  It's of course backlashing.
[01:49:33.325 --> 01:49:35.747]  They know already that they will probably lose the elections in 2020.
[01:49:37.856 --> 01:49:42.417]  And now they will have to recover.
[01:49:42.417 --> 01:49:45.817]  And I don't know how they're going to recover from all this.
[01:49:45.817 --> 01:49:53.139]  Because the party, as I said, went one step too far into the realm of socialism.
[01:49:53.139 --> 01:49:57.580]  We have been fighting for many years here in the U.S.
[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:01.980]  during the Cold War the evil ideology of communism.
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:05.461]  How is it possible that now there are parts of America that embrace
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:21.612]  51% in a Gallup poll of millennials want communism, but then they're wearing $200 jeans, they've got $1,000 smartphones, they'll pull up their communist events in New Jaguars.
[01:50:21.612 --> 01:50:22.293]  It's insane.
[01:50:22.293 --> 01:50:24.094]  What they really want is total political power.
[01:50:24.094 --> 01:50:30.601]  If you're a TV viewer, you see Roger and I toasting champagne when Trump won election night in November 2016.
[01:50:32.443 --> 01:50:32.703]  I don't
[01:50:53.607 --> 01:50:56.229]  Obama's going to leave stay-behind networks behind.
[01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:59.911]  And Roger respected me back then, but after it all came true, he's like, how do you know all this?
[01:50:59.911 --> 01:51:01.372]  Who are your contacts?
[01:51:01.372 --> 01:51:02.773]  I've been in politics 45 years.
[01:51:02.773 --> 01:51:03.874]  Nobody told me this.
[01:51:03.874 --> 01:51:05.495]  And I said, Roger, it's a different climate.
[01:51:05.495 --> 01:51:08.437]  I've studied how the globalists operate in other countries.
[01:51:08.437 --> 01:51:10.818]  Like in Italy, they put stay-behind networks in as well.
[01:51:10.818 --> 01:51:13.160]  And so that's what we have is a civil war in the government.
[01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:17.563]  You see, the stay-behind-networks we had in Italy were anti-communist.
[01:51:17.563 --> 01:51:21.746]  The moment they actually stopped operating, that's when the left took over.
[01:51:21.746 --> 01:51:22.206]  Exactly.
[01:51:22.206 --> 01:51:24.147]  These are leftist stay-behind-networks.
[01:51:24.147 --> 01:51:26.249]  Yes, these are leftist stay-behind-networks.
[01:51:26.249 --> 01:51:36.136]  And of course, part of it is in Antifa and in all those left-wing organizations like Sponsored by Soros.
[01:51:36.136 --> 01:51:42.080]  And it's all linked also to the Catholic Church, with the Jesuits that are promoting these illegal immigrants.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:46.404]  And facilitating their arrival, even, with the Bishop of Santa Fe.
[01:51:46.404 --> 01:51:50.788]  We saw him only last week carrying... Taking illegal aliens across the border.
[01:51:50.788 --> 01:51:53.150]  We're going to talk about that and how to stop that game plan.
[01:51:53.150 --> 01:51:55.252]  Now we've got all these other Catholic bishops in the U.S.
[01:51:55.252 --> 01:51:58.575]  saying, don't have open borders, so there's definitely a civil war in the church.
[01:51:58.575 --> 01:51:59.696]  But I want to say this.
[01:51:59.696 --> 01:52:05.701]  To the good stay behind networks of peaceful nationalists and patriots for 50 years, like Barry Goldwater,
[01:52:06.702 --> 01:52:06.982]  I don't
[01:52:27.899 --> 01:52:28.259]  Well, I was...
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:56.907]  I entered the military in 1989 because in Italy everybody had to do one year of military back then.
[01:52:56.907 --> 01:52:59.189]  It was obligatory.
[01:52:59.189 --> 01:53:05.155]  And during my time in the Air Force, I was recruited
[01:53:06.096 --> 01:53:19.867]  by Gladio, which was actually in the last, let's say it was almost the end of their operations, because at that point the Soviet Union was fading.
[01:53:19.867 --> 01:53:26.592]  And when it faded, then Gladio was the sponsorship that came from the U.S.
[01:53:26.592 --> 01:53:30.355]  Because you have to understand that people like, for example, Licio Gelli of the P2 Lodge,
[01:53:31.195 --> 01:53:37.338]  received approximately 10 million dollars a month to fight communism.
[01:53:37.338 --> 01:53:51.466]  Of course, a lot of things that were done were also, I mean, draconian, they were not always good things, because when they started to get into the strategy of tension from the end of the 60s into the 70s, Italy became a hell.
[01:53:51.946 --> 01:54:07.029]  became a hell zone, in which they started to explode bombs, innocent people died, and all this was to stop the takeover of the communist agents that were infiltrating.
[01:54:07.029 --> 01:54:08.790]  And of course Steve Pucinich was involved.
[01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:16.972]  Yes, he was involved, and actually he was really important during the kidnapping of the Prime Minister Aldo Moro.
[01:54:16.972 --> 01:54:17.992]  It was Kissinger who
[01:54:18.792 --> 01:54:29.479]  Apparently orchestrated the kidnapping of Aldo Moro because he wanted to bring this alliance between the Christian Democrats and the Communists together.
[01:54:29.479 --> 01:54:35.403]  And that will have already brought us to the level we are now.
[01:54:35.403 --> 01:54:42.208]  If it became a reality back then, that alliance, it's called Catto Communism.
[01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:48.132]  In Italy, actually, there's a movement that was born gradually from the 50s onwards called Catto Communism.
[01:54:48.953 --> 01:54:55.690]  And Catholic Communism means mixing Catholicism with Communism, which usually don't go together.
[01:54:56.910 --> 01:54:58.851]  But that's what the new pub's been doing.
[01:54:58.851 --> 01:55:05.635]  Yeah, now it's evident that this counter-communism is quite successful for all the liberals.
[01:55:05.635 --> 01:55:13.499]  They like the Pope because the Pope is totally left-wing, is totally pushing all their agendas together.
[01:55:13.499 --> 01:55:23.845]  And you have Joe Biden, who met last year in the Vatican with all these important people, and the Vatican paid for him to have his conference there.
[01:55:24.525 --> 01:55:26.346]  And there was a lot of it.
[01:55:26.346 --> 01:55:30.408]  And I had the leftist arm of the Vatican funding Georgetown suing me.
[01:55:30.408 --> 01:55:35.711]  Georgetown University is suing me for the fact that we pointed out that George Soros is funding anti-fascism here in Charlottesville.
[01:55:35.711 --> 01:55:38.313]  Georgetown, of course, is the Jesuits.
[01:55:38.313 --> 01:55:45.257]  That is really the place in which the Jesuits recruit all their future agents like the Clintons.
[01:55:45.257 --> 01:55:52.941]  So Georgetown, of course, wants to sue you, wants to ruin you, but because we have started criticizing Pope Francis very heavily here,
[01:55:54.222 --> 01:55:58.087]  As you remember, Alex... Oh, as soon as I started criticizing him, all hell broke loose.
[01:55:58.087 --> 01:55:58.968]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:55:58.968 --> 01:56:07.759]  You had Obama on your case, you had everybody attacking you because you can't mention the Vatican, you can't mention the Pope.
[01:56:07.759 --> 01:56:12.926]  Imagine, Bernie Sanders arrived in Rome begging to meet the Pope.
[01:56:14.022 --> 01:56:15.023]  Just begging.
[01:56:15.023 --> 01:56:20.287]  Because he said, oh, but Joe Biden had this big event and I didn't even meet the Pope.
[01:56:20.287 --> 01:56:21.568]  Let me meet him.
[01:56:21.568 --> 01:56:23.970]  In the end, they made him meet the Pope.
[01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:30.755]  He was coming out of his morning mass just quickly so he could finally have a talk with him.
[01:56:30.755 --> 01:56:33.778]  So Bernie Sanders, who is, of course, a communist.
[01:56:34.794 --> 01:56:37.836]  And now we have this meeting yesterday.
[01:56:37.836 --> 01:56:39.136]  Vladimir Putin... Stay there.
[01:56:39.136 --> 01:56:40.537]  Let's talk about this when we come back.
[01:56:40.537 --> 01:56:41.998]  Folks, remember, they're coming after us.
[01:56:41.998 --> 01:56:44.599]  That's how we get funded, is by your support.
[01:56:44.599 --> 01:56:53.304]  We have the new Betsy Ross flags in navy blue and in white that say, these colors don't run on the front, on the back, America's back, Infowars.com.
[01:56:53.304 --> 01:56:59.127]  You don't know how this will trigger libtards in your area and how it will enthuse patriots in your area.
[01:56:59.127 --> 01:57:00.048]  And another version that says,
[01:57:00.868 --> 01:57:06.971]  Since 1776 under the flag, but on the back the shirt is the same.
[01:57:06.971 --> 01:57:10.293]  It says that America's back in full wars.com.
[01:57:10.293 --> 01:57:12.454]  This is a sexy shirt.
[01:57:12.454 --> 01:57:13.915]  It's an awesome shirt.
[01:57:13.915 --> 01:57:16.417]  It's an exciting shirt and it funds this operation.
[01:57:16.417 --> 01:57:17.537]  It's limited edition.
[01:57:17.537 --> 01:57:19.438]  We're printing a thousand of each.
[01:57:19.438 --> 01:57:20.539]  So four thousand of these.
[01:57:21.977 --> 01:57:26.341]  Two different variants, two different shirts, two different messages, but two different colors.
[01:57:26.341 --> 01:57:27.602]  So it's a total of four.
[01:57:27.602 --> 01:57:31.085]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA2533139.
[01:57:31.085 --> 01:57:38.312]  And this weekend's the last weekend to get store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, and 50% off all the supplements.
[01:57:38.312 --> 01:57:44.978]  So whether it's the Great Fluoride Free Toothpaste, whether it's Body's Ultimate Turmeric, or whether it's the new Ultra 12, it's all 50% off.
[01:57:47.608 --> 01:57:48.988]  There is no longer any doubt.
[01:57:48.988 --> 01:57:54.870]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent, Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[01:57:54.870 --> 01:57:56.951]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[01:57:56.951 --> 01:57:58.511]  Already born babies are being killed.
[01:57:58.511 --> 01:57:59.651]  World government is here.
[01:57:59.651 --> 01:58:00.972]  Now is the time for decision.
[01:58:00.972 --> 01:58:04.053]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[01:58:04.053 --> 01:58:11.915]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag, and attacking the family, and that are attacking our borders, and our country, and our military, and our heritage.
[01:58:11.915 --> 01:58:14.295]  If you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[01:58:14.295 --> 01:58:16.296]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[01:58:16.536 --> 01:58:19.337]  And that means buying products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:58:19.337 --> 01:58:21.197]  And that means praying for InfoWars.
[01:58:21.197 --> 01:58:22.277]  And praying for President Trump.
[01:58:22.277 --> 01:58:23.217]  And praying for yourself.
[01:58:23.217 --> 01:58:24.278]  And praying for peace.
[01:58:24.278 --> 01:58:25.418]  Praying for justice.
[01:58:25.418 --> 01:58:27.738]  We're running it through July 4th, but it's got to end.
[01:58:27.738 --> 01:58:29.519]  Because we're running out of a lot of the best-selling items.
[01:58:29.519 --> 01:58:31.659]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[01:58:31.659 --> 01:58:33.339]  Store-wide free shipping.
[01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:35.460]  50% off all the supplements and double Patriot Points.
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:36.400]  Sign up for auto-ship.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:37.080]  Cancel any time.
[01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:37.620]  It's free.
[01:58:37.620 --> 01:58:39.541]  An additional 10% off on your next order.
[01:58:39.541 --> 01:58:41.161]  You cannot beat these deals.
[01:58:41.161 --> 01:58:44.982]  The best we ever offer at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:58:48.524 --> 01:58:49.865]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[01:58:49.865 --> 01:58:50.645]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[01:58:50.645 --> 01:58:51.205]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:51.205 --> 01:58:51.746]  Hey, Alex.
[01:58:51.746 --> 01:58:54.567]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[01:58:54.567 --> 01:59:00.691]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[01:59:00.691 --> 01:59:09.476]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[01:59:09.476 --> 01:59:10.636]  That's it.
[01:59:10.636 --> 01:59:13.278]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[01:59:13.278 --> 01:59:16.139]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[01:59:16.139 --> 01:59:17.440]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.340]  I agree entirely.
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:23.803]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[01:59:23.803 --> 01:59:26.584]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[01:59:26.584 --> 01:59:28.644]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[01:59:28.644 --> 01:59:37.888]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[01:59:37.888 --> 01:59:39.789]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[01:59:39.789 --> 01:59:46.292]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[01:59:46.292 --> 01:59:47.232]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[01:59:51.696 --> 01:59:54.309]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:08.314 --> 02:00:14.740]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:18.184]  All right, this is going to be a jam-packed third hour that Paul Watson's coming up.
[02:00:18.184 --> 02:00:20.226]  Robert Barnes is in the other studio.
[02:00:20.226 --> 02:00:22.948]  We've got Leo Zagami here in the United States from Italy.
[02:00:22.948 --> 02:00:28.113]  Talking about inside baseball, this guy knows his stuff, as you were just witnessing and as you were just hearing.
[02:00:29.206 --> 02:00:36.697]  But first, this clip of Democrats literally hating on the existence of America itself to let you know they work for the globalists.
[02:00:36.697 --> 02:00:38.520]  They should be totally rejected.
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:40.282]  They tell us we shouldn't even have 4th of July.
[02:00:40.282 --> 02:00:41.344]  They hate the American flag.
[02:00:41.344 --> 02:00:41.684]  Here it is.
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:48.901]  When I hear these things about, let's make America great again, I think to myself, well exactly when did you think America was great?
[02:00:48.901 --> 02:00:50.982]  We're not going to make America great again.
[02:00:50.982 --> 02:00:53.082]  It was never that great.
[02:00:53.082 --> 02:00:56.303]  There's things that are savagely wrong in this country.
[02:00:56.303 --> 02:00:59.283]  What we're seeing in this country doesn't reflect our spirit.
[02:00:59.283 --> 02:01:02.604]  What we're seeing in this country doesn't reflect our potential.
[02:01:02.604 --> 02:01:07.245]  Raise your hand if your government plan would provide coverage for undocumented immigrants.
[02:01:11.661 --> 02:01:15.104]  Yes, we're supposed to be for a 70% tax rate on the wealthy.
[02:01:15.104 --> 02:01:23.652]  You hear folks say there's not enough money, what I say to them every single time is, there's plenty of money in this world, there's plenty of money in this country, it's just in the wrong hands.
[02:01:23.652 --> 02:01:28.016]  When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto.
[02:01:28.616 --> 02:01:31.077]  You don't know what it's like to be poor.
[02:01:31.077 --> 02:01:36.979]  We're in late phase capitalism and we know it doesn't work and we've got to move into something new.
[02:01:36.979 --> 02:01:42.561]  And I believe in community ownership of land, labor, resources and distribution of those resources.
[02:01:42.561 --> 02:01:48.423]  And so whatever that morphs into I think is what will serve community the best.
[02:01:48.423 --> 02:01:52.025]  And I'm excited to usher it in by any means necessary.
[02:01:52.025 --> 02:01:54.066]  Any means necessary.
[02:01:54.066 --> 02:01:57.027]  This liberal will be all about socializing.
[02:01:59.747 --> 02:02:10.659]  Would be about basically taking over and the government running all of your companies.
[02:02:10.659 --> 02:02:18.608]  Raise your hand if you think it should be a civil offense rather than a crime to cross a border without documentation.
[02:02:18.608 --> 02:02:20.451]  Can we keep our hands up so we can see them?
[02:02:24.631 --> 02:02:41.477]  Those people who are online making fun of members of Congress are a disgrace.
[02:02:41.477 --> 02:02:46.658]  And there's no need for anyone to think that is unacceptable.
[02:02:46.658 --> 02:02:51.200]  We're going to shut them down and work with whoever it is to shut them down.
[02:02:51.460 --> 02:02:53.121]  And they should be prosecuted.
[02:02:53.121 --> 02:02:54.222]  I want them shut down.
[02:02:54.222 --> 02:02:55.183]  I want them silenced.
[02:02:55.183 --> 02:02:56.023]  I want them muted.
[02:02:56.023 --> 02:02:58.045]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:02:58.045 --> 02:03:04.149]  So folks, look, if you start off with the notion there's nothing you can do, well, why don't you all go home then, man?
[02:03:04.149 --> 02:03:07.051]  Or let's start a real physical revolution if you're talking about it.
[02:03:08.849 --> 02:03:16.692]  A so-called anti-fascist website is encouraging, quote, all manner of physical violence against Trump supporters and capitalists.
[02:03:16.692 --> 02:03:21.874]  Today we are lifting up these stories in the hopes that you will see the light!
[02:03:21.874 --> 02:03:25.115]  And if you don't, we will bring the fire!
[02:03:25.115 --> 02:03:28.516]  Get the f*** out of here!
[02:03:28.516 --> 02:03:32.758]  Get the f*** out of here!
[02:03:33.178 --> 02:03:40.545]  After arriving in the emergency room, I had a CT scan which confirmed that I was diagnosed with a brain hemorrhage.
[02:03:49.935 --> 02:03:52.198]  Coming up, Robert Barnes is in the other studio.
[02:03:52.198 --> 02:03:52.959]  Leo Zegami here.
[02:03:52.959 --> 02:03:54.160]  But Leo, I wanted to show you this.
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:55.682]  Here it was in the news.
[02:03:55.682 --> 02:04:00.587]  Prophetic forecast by Zegami on EU elections and the surprise for the American patriots.
[02:04:00.587 --> 02:04:05.913]  And here he is presenting this one bottle of special champagne that they presented there.
[02:04:06.534 --> 02:04:07.014]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:26.983 --> 02:04:34.168]  It's a unique moment of, as I said before earlier, of renaissance.
[02:04:34.168 --> 02:04:37.930]  Renaissance means... It felt like 2.0 July 4th.
[02:04:37.930 --> 02:04:38.571]  Yeah.
[02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:40.572]  Remaissance means?
[02:04:40.572 --> 02:04:42.253]  Means taking back your sovereignty.
[02:04:42.253 --> 02:04:56.183]  Means taking back your sovereignty with respect to this new world order that instead wants to globalize everything and send us into this communist nightmare, so... I really feel like I should be smashing this glass, because if you do really special things, that's what you gotta do.
[02:04:56.663 --> 02:05:00.908]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:05:00.908 --> 02:05:11.299]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[02:05:11.299 --> 02:05:14.522]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale of
[02:05:14.602 --> 02:05:14.902]  I'm good.
[02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:48.509]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[02:05:48.509 --> 02:05:55.212]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[02:06:05.273 --> 02:06:07.954]  Last night was incredible.
[02:06:07.954 --> 02:06:13.935]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:13.935 --> 02:06:20.197]  You know, a lot of folks have asked me, man, Robert Barnes is like on the show every week, and like one week out of the month he's in Austin.
[02:06:20.197 --> 02:06:23.898]  Yeah, he's our chief legal counsel, but that's not why Bob's here all the time.
[02:06:23.898 --> 02:06:25.999]  He likes coming on the show, and I like Bob.
[02:06:25.999 --> 02:06:26.899]  He's my buddy.
[02:06:26.899 --> 02:06:28.499]  He's a friendly, funny guy.
[02:06:28.499 --> 02:06:29.760]  He was out there with me and my kids.
[02:06:30.700 --> 02:06:38.526]  And Zimmerman's a friend, cooking steaks and everything else with my wife at the lake, out there fishing.
[02:06:38.526 --> 02:06:44.390]  Two of my children are at camp, but my other children, my son and my youngest daughter were there, and Barnes was there.
[02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:48.514]  And we got back off the lake, we're cooking steaks, had dinner, fireworks are going off.
[02:06:48.514 --> 02:06:51.376]  We saw the speech from two hours before of the president.
[02:06:51.376 --> 02:06:55.339]  We were all particularly blown away, I thought.
[02:06:55.999 --> 02:06:59.064]  I mean, I really, really, really, really, really liked it.
[02:06:59.064 --> 02:07:04.152]  And so we're going to be getting Robert Barnes' take on that here in just a few minutes.
[02:07:04.152 --> 02:07:07.256]  But going back to Leo Zagami, author, researcher, leozagami.com.
[02:07:09.272 --> 02:07:12.293]  I want to become American because Donald J. Trump is the president.
[02:07:12.293 --> 02:07:15.875]  If it was another president, I would probably renounce this idea.
[02:07:15.875 --> 02:07:24.279]  But the fact that Donald J. Trump is the president forced me to become American because he's the only president in the world that is opposing globalism.
[02:07:24.279 --> 02:07:25.479]  You understand, Alex?
[02:07:25.479 --> 02:07:26.520]  He's the only one.
[02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:30.762]  I mean, he might not be the perfect president, but he's doing a great job.
[02:07:31.636 --> 02:07:32.716]  Well, he's not a dictator.
[02:07:32.716 --> 02:07:37.217]  I mean, I've got a hundred employees, and they're all great people, but it's hard to get them all going in one direction.
[02:07:37.217 --> 02:07:38.217]  He's facing mutiny.
[02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:39.878]  He's facing all this resistance.
[02:07:39.878 --> 02:07:49.920]  We're going to get Barnes' take on that in a moment, but speaking of Trump, let's play a clip of him, about a three-minute clip, getting into innovation and trailblazing, and the American spirit of excellence.
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:52.000]  At one point, he gets tears in his eyes.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.701]  Here it is.
[02:07:53.701 --> 02:07:59.102]  We will always be the people who defeated a tyrant, crossed the continent,
[02:07:59.912 --> 02:08:05.634]  Harness science, took to the skies, and soared into the heavens.
[02:08:05.634 --> 02:08:12.017]  Because we will never forget that we are Americans, and the future belongs to us.
[02:08:17.341 --> 02:08:22.324]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[02:08:22.324 --> 02:08:29.608]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[02:08:29.608 --> 02:08:40.094]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart, and we are all made by the same almighty God.
[02:08:51.994 --> 02:09:19.571]  From the banks of the Chesapeake, to the cliffs of California, from the humming shores of the Great Lakes, to the sand dunes of the Carolinas, from the fields of the Heartland, to the Everglades of Florida, the spirit of American independence will never fade, never fail, but will reign forever and ever and ever.
[02:09:24.895 --> 02:09:32.941]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom, we remember that all share a truly extraordinary heritage.
[02:09:32.941 --> 02:09:39.186]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[02:09:39.186 --> 02:09:47.792]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right and what they know is true.
[02:09:48.593 --> 02:09:55.637]  It is the chronicle of brave citizens who never give up on the dream of a better and brighter future.
[02:09:55.637 --> 02:10:05.543]  And it is the saga of 13 separate colonies that united to form the most just and virtuous republic ever conceived.
[02:10:06.403 --> 02:10:23.052]  On this day, 243 years ago, our founding fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to declare independence and defend our God-given rights.
[02:10:23.052 --> 02:10:30.396]  Alright folks, we're gonna come back to more of the 1776 relaunch of the country, but what does America mean to you, Robert Barnes, and then Leo Zegami?
[02:10:30.396 --> 02:10:30.717]  For me,
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:42.390]  Gutenberg Press, the Renaissance, coming out of the Dark Ages, and the flower of the Renaissance was America, and people all running to here to really try to establish freedom.
[02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:48.276]  Didn't mean we were perfect, but there was really the ethos of that plan that's now led the world.
[02:10:48.276 --> 02:10:53.962]  And there are those, the modern technocracy, who are authoritarians, who seek to discredit
[02:10:54.562 --> 02:11:15.117]  The liberalism of the West, by posing as liberals themselves, who are really left-hand path, occultic leftists, who seek to overthrow the classical liberalism that they would call right-wing extremism, that they've really, like The Thing, taken over America, and then posed as if they were the institutions.
[02:11:15.117 --> 02:11:21.102]  But I see this as a revolution, returning those institutions back to the people, and that's why we're seeing the convulsions.
[02:11:22.794 --> 02:11:23.375]  No doubt about it.
[02:11:23.375 --> 02:11:29.059]  I mean, you look at sort of America and Christianity did not start slavery, it ended it.
[02:11:29.059 --> 02:11:42.328]  America as a country, as an idea, as an actual government and Christianity came together to not only end slavery, but they didn't start segregation or racial oppression that long predated them, but it was one of the first countries to end it and to get rid of it.
[02:11:42.728 --> 02:11:55.136]  So, America has taken the lead at ending almost every mechanism and method of oppression in the world, whether it be rule by royalty, whether it be rule by elites, whether it be empires built on ceaseless war... Women's suffrage!
[02:11:56.067 --> 02:11:56.467]  Exactly.
[02:11:56.467 --> 02:12:06.677]  Human suffrage, whether it be slavery, whether it be racial oppression, any of it, America has been at the lead, Christianity has been at the lead of making the world a better, safer, stronger place for the world.
[02:12:06.677 --> 02:12:14.024]  And that's what Trump was going through, one by one, all the different examples in such a tiny time period from a historical, contextual perspective.
[02:12:14.324 --> 02:12:24.713]  And over, in just 200 years, one country took the lead in lighting the flame of liberty for everybody around the world in a wide range of contexts.
[02:12:24.713 --> 02:12:40.326]  Whether it be war, whether it be suffrage, whether it be oppression, whether it be political power, whether it be economic power, whether it be social power, whether it be science, whether it be exploring space, whether it be exploring the world, did so in little-d democratic ways that made the world more democratic economically, politically, socially, and culturally.
[02:12:40.646 --> 02:12:52.731]  And did so by recognizing its religious foundations, did so by recognizing its spiritual roots, did so by recognizing its political orientation, and did so by recognizing the traditions of its fathers and its forefathers.
[02:12:52.731 --> 02:12:59.814]  And that's what the President was proud of, and rightfully proud of, because America as a country has more to be proud of than any country in the world by far.
[02:12:59.814 --> 02:13:05.536]  Not only as of this time period right now, but as in looking at time over all the course of history.
[02:13:05.816 --> 02:13:06.236]  That's right.
[02:13:06.236 --> 02:13:07.277]  And let's be clear.
[02:13:07.277 --> 02:13:08.257]  You just knocked it out of the park.
[02:13:08.257 --> 02:13:11.598]  That was a grand slam, if there ever was one, of Veritas.
[02:13:11.598 --> 02:13:17.080]  We have become exceptionally evil in some respects, because with great power comes great responsibility.
[02:13:17.080 --> 02:13:19.361]  As Lord Acton said, power tends to corrupt.
[02:13:19.361 --> 02:13:21.082]  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:13:21.082 --> 02:13:24.383]  So we've had great power, and so evils come and try to take over.
[02:13:24.383 --> 02:13:28.704]  So now we're a paradox of incredible good, innovation, and love, but also incredible evil.
[02:13:28.704 --> 02:13:29.605]  And there's a fight now
[02:13:30.245 --> 02:13:32.466]  Over the soul of America.
[02:13:32.466 --> 02:13:39.070]  And Trump, I see this as a ritual, an exorcism of the evil, of the hate of the left.
[02:13:39.070 --> 02:13:40.691]  And Trump knows it's a ritual.
[02:13:40.691 --> 02:13:42.151]  Melania knows it's a ritual.
[02:13:42.151 --> 02:13:50.456]  And as I sat there last night on that HDTV, watching her with tears in her eyes, Trump with tears in his eyes, I knew my gut was always right.
[02:13:51.755 --> 02:13:55.479]  The enemy's response tells you Trump's good, but this was a magic moment.
[02:13:55.479 --> 02:13:57.081]  We'll come back to you, Robert Barnes.
[02:13:57.081 --> 02:13:59.464]  Powerful things he just said, Leo Zegami.
[02:13:59.464 --> 02:14:01.086]  Getting back the American dream.
[02:14:01.086 --> 02:14:05.171]  It was becoming a nightmare with the Clinton era, the Bush era.
[02:14:05.171 --> 02:14:06.232]  It was becoming a nightmare.
[02:14:06.232 --> 02:14:07.333]  They were there to demoralize us.
[02:14:07.333 --> 02:14:08.234]  Yeah, of course.
[02:14:08.234 --> 02:14:10.757]  And now we can dream again because the world needs...
[02:14:11.698 --> 02:14:13.338]  America dreaming again.
[02:14:13.338 --> 02:14:15.119]  We need to be able to dream something.
[02:14:15.119 --> 02:14:16.099]  Dreaming of aircraft.
[02:14:16.099 --> 02:14:16.939]  Dreaming of science.
[02:14:16.939 --> 02:14:18.000]  Dreaming of freedom.
[02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.360]  Dreaming of free speech.
[02:14:19.360 --> 02:14:25.562]  Without the dream, we are as a species, as a human race, we will not have posterity.
[02:14:25.562 --> 02:14:30.003]  We will not have envisioned the great things that America has offered us.
[02:14:30.003 --> 02:14:30.983]  Because dream is vision.
[02:14:31.303 --> 02:14:32.303]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:32.303 --> 02:14:40.005]  And dream also is you create those images and in magic, for example, is connected to the word imago, which is image.
[02:14:40.005 --> 02:14:44.386]  So you imagine things and then you put them into reality.
[02:14:44.386 --> 02:14:46.427]  But if you don't imagine them, they will never come.
[02:14:46.427 --> 02:14:47.707]  And you're also an expert on the occult.
[02:14:47.707 --> 02:14:49.027]  You're a Christian, but explain.
[02:14:49.027 --> 02:14:51.068]  Trump, no doubt, did a huge Christian ritual yesterday.
[02:14:51.608 --> 02:14:52.348]  Absolutely.
[02:14:52.348 --> 02:14:53.648]  I mean, it's an egregore.
[02:14:53.648 --> 02:14:55.009]  Egregore means a fourth form.
[02:14:55.009 --> 02:14:59.990]  You put together many people thinking the same thing, you obtain a fourth form.
[02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:01.910]  And that is incredibly powerful.
[02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:04.351]  So, yes, here... This was highest level magic?
[02:15:04.351 --> 02:15:04.991]  Absolutely.
[02:15:04.991 --> 02:15:06.211]  Not from an occult perspective?
[02:15:06.211 --> 02:15:06.551]  No, no, no, no.
[02:15:06.551 --> 02:15:09.832]  The devil tries to twist God's systems and put names on it.
[02:15:09.832 --> 02:15:13.052]  Listen, even churches are egregore.
[02:15:13.052 --> 02:15:16.493]  I mean, when people get together in church, they form an egregore.
[02:15:16.493 --> 02:15:19.294]  And many churches together form then a belief system.
[02:15:19.294 --> 02:15:20.834]  The Bible says that two people together...
[02:15:21.514 --> 02:15:22.675]  It's done in heaven.
[02:15:22.675 --> 02:15:32.063]  Yeah, and if you have more than two people thinking all positive energy... And that's why they're trying to break us down because they know InfoWars is one of the main...
[02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:37.385]  Power drivers like a hydroelectric dam powering Trump.
[02:15:37.385 --> 02:15:38.506]  They can't stand it.
[02:15:38.506 --> 02:15:40.669]  They've not blown this power structure out.
[02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:41.570]  They've only made it stronger.
[02:15:41.570 --> 02:15:44.453]  We're sending more power to Trump.
[02:15:44.453 --> 02:15:45.575]  Infowars.com.
[02:15:45.575 --> 02:15:47.136]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:15:47.136 --> 02:15:49.679]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[02:15:49.679 --> 02:15:51.161]  Full power!
[02:15:51.161 --> 02:15:52.263]  Damn the torpedoes!
[02:15:52.263 --> 02:15:53.144]  Go straight at them!
[02:15:55.327 --> 02:16:06.517]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:16:06.517 --> 02:16:13.404]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an
[02:16:13.624 --> 02:16:15.825]  Endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:16:15.825 --> 02:16:21.106]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here, right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[02:16:21.106 --> 02:16:33.289]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the flood water's backstory.
[02:16:33.289 --> 02:16:34.549]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:36.530]  Check out the PPX microgrid system
[02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:37.450]  I don't think so.
[02:16:56.198 --> 02:17:00.121]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.121 --> 02:17:01.662]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.662 --> 02:17:04.624]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.624 --> 02:17:10.188]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.188 --> 02:17:11.388]  I can help you too.
[02:17:11.388 --> 02:17:14.330]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.330 --> 02:17:16.532]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:19:42.863 --> 02:19:46.745]  But regardless, fish oil for adults, for children, the very best out there.

[02:19:52.688 --> 02:19:59.212]  And the big sale's running right now in 4store.com.
[02:19:59.212 --> 02:20:01.834]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:16.713 --> 02:20:22.360]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:24.703]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.044 --> 02:20:42.239]  In October of 1775, the Continental Congress ordered the construction of two swift sailing vessels, each carrying 10 cannons and 80 men, to sail eastward.
[02:20:42.239 --> 02:20:46.023]  Our young fleet tested their sea legs against the most powerful navy.
[02:20:46.806 --> 02:20:49.249]  The world has ever seen.
[02:20:49.249 --> 02:21:00.841]  John Paul Jones, America's first great naval hero, said, I wish to have no connection with any ship that does not sail fast, for I intend to go in harm's way.
[02:21:01.789 --> 02:21:12.911]  He got his wish many times when his ship was shot into pieces off the coast of England by a British vessel and her four dozen guns.
[02:21:12.911 --> 02:21:21.433]  When demanded to surrender, Jones very famously declared, I have not yet begun to fight.
[02:21:21.433 --> 02:21:24.274]  And took the British ship an hour later.
[02:21:24.274 --> 02:21:25.014]  Three times it stops.
[02:21:29.628 --> 02:21:35.133]  When our Navy begins fighting, they finish the job.
[02:21:35.133 --> 02:21:35.994]  Absolutely.
[02:21:35.994 --> 02:21:39.237]  Robert Barnes, you were very prophetic what you just said earlier.
[02:21:39.237 --> 02:21:39.998]  Very powerful.
[02:21:39.998 --> 02:21:42.140]  And I want Leo Zegami here.
[02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:43.962]  Both of you guys are amazing speakers.
[02:21:43.962 --> 02:21:44.843]  I don't hype things.
[02:21:44.843 --> 02:21:45.604]  Everybody knows that.
[02:21:45.604 --> 02:21:48.026]  I really tell you what I think is going on.
[02:21:48.026 --> 02:21:50.929]  And we've had decades of evil and decades of globalism.
[02:21:50.929 --> 02:21:53.371]  And they're trying to demoralize us and run us down now.
[02:21:54.682 --> 02:21:55.983]  I see them jumping the shark.
[02:21:55.983 --> 02:21:58.244]  We talked about this last night, and I showed you examples.
[02:21:58.244 --> 02:22:01.006]  After we went to bed, Owen had been there earlier in the day.
[02:22:01.006 --> 02:22:02.947]  He came back in out of town.
[02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:04.948]  We went out at the lake.
[02:22:04.948 --> 02:22:15.154]  All those articles, all those videos, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS, taking down videos, trashing it, saying it was horrible, saying it was all about Trump, saying Trump's horrible.
[02:22:15.154 --> 02:22:16.055]  Everybody hated it.
[02:22:16.055 --> 02:22:17.296]  There were no crowds there.
[02:22:17.296 --> 02:22:19.557]  But suddenly, they just backed off.
[02:22:19.557 --> 02:22:20.718]  First, they said there were no crowds there.
[02:22:22.939 --> 02:22:28.728]  One of our reports, or one of Paul's reports, Summit.News, about how big the crowd was.
[02:22:28.728 --> 02:22:35.499]  To me, that's a bellwether, though, that now they're finally pulling propaganda en masse when they know we're not buying it.
[02:22:36.963 --> 02:22:37.623]  No doubt about that.
[02:22:37.623 --> 02:22:50.607]  I mean, clearly they had a story scripted, and the story was going to be Trump fails, Trump has to back down, nobody shows up, Mother Nature doesn't like Trump, doesn't like America.
[02:22:50.607 --> 02:23:01.231]  They were trying to push Colin Kaepernick's tweet where he misquoted or quoted out of context Frederick Douglass' great July 4th speech from back in 1845.
[02:23:01.231 --> 02:23:05.252]  So there was all this effort to sort of demonize America, and you get a sense for how important
[02:23:06.433 --> 02:23:10.877]  American history, American freedom, American liberty is all connected together.
[02:23:10.877 --> 02:23:26.753]  That's the reason why the President had that ritualistic celebration yesterday, did so celebrating our military prowess, did so celebrating the spirit of our history, did so by celebrating all of the heroes and patriots over time who've done extraordinary things to keep the light of liberty alive.
[02:23:27.193 --> 02:23:29.194]  And not only here in America, but around the world.
[02:23:29.194 --> 02:23:31.276]  Because it's America that led the world.
[02:23:31.276 --> 02:23:36.720]  Every other democratic country post-dates the American Revolution in any meaningful manner.
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:39.101]  It was the United States that kept freedom alive.
[02:23:39.101 --> 02:23:44.385]  It's the United States of America that created that freedom, instigated that freedom, and spread that freedom, and protected that freedom.
[02:23:45.025 --> 02:23:48.788]  It's the United States who overcame communism and attempts and fascism.
[02:23:48.788 --> 02:23:53.512]  It's the United States who is the back-to-back World War champs in World War I and World War II.
[02:23:53.512 --> 02:23:58.876]  It's the United States that has managed to keep us out of wars, for the most part, like President Trump has done.
[02:23:58.876 --> 02:24:11.526]  So what the people that are, again, who want to, the deep state apparatus, the Democrats, people on the left, who want to demonize America, demonize Christianity, demonize the American founders and freedom and liberty, demonize even the flag.
[02:24:11.786 --> 02:24:17.372]  They were burning the flag yesterday, wherever they could, whenever they could, however they could, even in the nation's capital.
[02:24:17.372 --> 02:24:21.776]  There were attacks on people for wearing Make America Great Again hats.
[02:24:21.776 --> 02:24:30.926]  Those are people who basically need to demonize American history because that history tells a story of freedom and of liberty and is very popular around the world.
[02:24:31.246 --> 02:25:01.006]  That's why the President's speech yesterday was so critical, his celebration so important, his ritual invocation so essential to protecting the American founding dream of freedom and liberty that ordinary everyday people keep alive, but that the political elites, the cultural elites, the social elites, and the economic elites want to oppress, suppress, want to recreate, and want to tell a false and fake narrative in order to be able to tell a story where Nike's scared to even put out a shoe that celebrates the Betsy Ross flag.
[02:25:01.386 --> 02:25:04.467]  That's the kind of world they need to create in order to create their world.
[02:25:04.467 --> 02:25:06.007]  That's why they want open borders.
[02:25:06.007 --> 02:25:08.607]  That's why they want trade without any protections.
[02:25:08.607 --> 02:25:11.028]  That's why they want ceaseless and endless wars.
[02:25:11.028 --> 02:25:15.509]  They want the American ideal to basically be defamed.
[02:25:15.509 --> 02:25:21.170]  The Statue of Liberty to be scarred in ways that it will not be remembered amongst the ordinary everyday American public.
[02:25:21.170 --> 02:25:23.290]  So that kids don't know who our own country is.
[02:25:23.290 --> 02:25:24.991]  Our country isn't the country that started slavery.
[02:25:24.991 --> 02:25:27.231]  It's the country that went to a civil war to end it.
[02:25:27.691 --> 02:25:30.112]  Our country isn't the country that started racial oppression.
[02:25:30.112 --> 02:25:32.093]  It was the one that led the world to end it.
[02:25:32.093 --> 02:25:34.613]  Our country wasn't the world that had royalty rule.
[02:25:34.613 --> 02:25:38.035]  Our country was the one that created democracy for the whole world to follow.
[02:25:38.035 --> 02:25:38.875]  So that's who America is.
[02:25:38.875 --> 02:25:39.955]  America isn't fascist.
[02:25:39.955 --> 02:25:41.216]  America isn't communist.
[02:25:41.216 --> 02:25:47.318]  America is what put an end to fascism and communism in back-to-back world wars over a 50-year time frame.
[02:25:47.398 --> 02:25:48.938]  I don't know, maybe they want the Queen to rule them again.
[02:26:15.706 --> 02:26:20.650]  No, that's what the New York Times said, what Vox says, that they just are beside them.
[02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:23.092]  What is it about America that makes them so mad?
[02:26:23.092 --> 02:26:30.439]  It's crazy, because if this Declaration of Independence didn't happen, we would still be ruled here by the Queen of England.
[02:26:30.439 --> 02:26:31.700]  Imagine that, guys.
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:39.487]  The Queen of England and that family of Hanoverians, which actually is still ruling this country, England.
[02:26:39.487 --> 02:26:41.369]  They're not even British, explain that.
[02:26:41.923 --> 02:26:43.104]  Well, not even British, of course.
[02:26:43.104 --> 02:26:48.147]  Since the time of Queen Victoria, they married into a German nobility.
[02:26:48.147 --> 02:26:57.574]  And it was actually a relative of mine, the Queen Mother, Elizabeth Bowles-Lyon, that brought back a bit of Britishness into the equation.
[02:26:57.574 --> 02:27:00.736]  Because the Queen Mother was the cousin of my grandfather.
[02:27:00.736 --> 02:27:05.780]  So, the fact that the British still follow and worship this royal family
[02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:10.662]  Gives you an idea of where America would be right now in 2019.
[02:27:10.662 --> 02:27:12.382]  And that would be a nightmare.
[02:27:12.382 --> 02:27:19.705]  I know that the Democrats are so obsessed that the whole of the Hollywood apparatus still worships all these royal families.
[02:27:19.705 --> 02:27:26.268]  And every time I go in any Walmart, I see all these newspapers and they only talk about the British royal families.
[02:27:26.268 --> 02:27:27.588]  How is this possible?
[02:27:27.588 --> 02:27:30.830]  Why don't you talk about the beautiful family Donald Trump has?
[02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:37.171]  They haven't given Melania one major magazine cover, even though she's a dream.
[02:27:37.171 --> 02:27:44.173]  They prefer to talk about Prince William, Prince Harry, the American wife.
[02:27:44.173 --> 02:27:52.654]  You think we're a British Commonwealth, and that all happened with the anglification with the CFR in 1922, where they tried to get us to merge the British Empire.
[02:27:52.654 --> 02:27:55.235]  These people are clearly anti-American.
[02:27:55.595 --> 02:28:07.908]  Even my own mother is anti-American, and I am sorry to say that on the air, but I mean it's a shame for me, but I had to declare independence for my mother, because she is just like them.
[02:28:07.908 --> 02:28:13.273]  They're part of this mindset, you know, and it's like a nightmare.
[02:28:13.273 --> 02:28:18.619]  Is it because the American system challenged the empires for so long, they've been obsessed with taking it over?
[02:28:19.702 --> 02:28:28.488]  Yeah, I mean, for people like my mother, I mean, from the English aristocracy, whatever, America is still treated like a colony that rebelled.
[02:28:28.488 --> 02:28:32.591]  Oh, those evildoers, they should have stayed with us!
[02:28:32.591 --> 02:28:43.378]  Oh my God, they're just so far out, and they still try to sabotage America, because America is bringing forward this dream of independence, of liberty.
[02:28:44.278 --> 02:28:51.122]  Well, I'll tell you, we're gonna get more from Robert Barnes and Leo Zegami on where they think this fight goes, how the Globals will try to take Trump out, and more.
[02:28:51.122 --> 02:28:52.823]  Tomorrow's news today, it's July 5th, 2019.
[02:28:55.259 --> 02:29:06.446]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:06.446 --> 02:29:15.771]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's gonna let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:15.771 --> 02:29:21.054]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East Bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:21.054 --> 02:29:24.016]  Because of the flooding we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a
[02:29:24.136 --> 02:29:24.516]  That's right.
[02:29:43.928 --> 02:29:45.129]  And a ton of bonuses too.
[02:29:45.129 --> 02:29:45.789]  And the best part?
[02:29:45.789 --> 02:29:46.990]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500, $300 or even $200.
[02:29:46.990 --> 02:29:48.391]  Go to MyOwnPowerGrid.com to learn more.
[02:29:48.391 --> 02:29:49.012]  That's MyOwnPowerGrid.com.
[02:29:56.977 --> 02:29:58.037]  The time has come.
[02:29:58.037 --> 02:29:59.018]  The time is here.
[02:29:59.018 --> 02:30:11.041]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[02:30:11.041 --> 02:30:23.164]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status, and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and the U.S.
[02:30:23.504 --> 02:30:24.085]  I think?
[02:30:46.788 --> 02:30:49.310]  50% off, store-bought free shipping, double Patriot points.
[02:30:49.310 --> 02:30:55.895]  Whatever you do, commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalists.
[02:30:57.874 --> 02:31:01.997]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:31:01.997 --> 02:31:05.140]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[02:31:05.140 --> 02:31:08.302]  And we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[02:31:08.302 --> 02:31:20.512]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[02:31:20.512 --> 02:31:25.696]  And so I feel very strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart.
[02:31:25.696 --> 02:31:26.897]  And I want you to know that love is right back
[02:31:26.977 --> 02:31:28.598]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:31:57.324 --> 02:31:58.385]  The time has come.
[02:31:58.385 --> 02:31:59.365]  The time is here.
[02:31:59.365 --> 02:32:11.393]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world could come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[02:32:11.393 --> 02:32:22.961]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe and
[02:32:23.021 --> 02:32:23.321]  We're good.
[02:32:41.684 --> 02:32:45.128]  Do your shopping with us, and we will continue on the face of this.
[02:32:45.128 --> 02:32:59.224]  InfoWareStore.com, 50% off, store-wide free shipping, double patriot points, whatever you do, commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalists.
[02:32:59.224 --> 02:33:01.827]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.345 --> 02:33:16.912]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:33:16.912 --> 02:33:23.138]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[02:33:23.138 --> 02:33:25.741]  And I'll take you live to the heart of the Resistance.
[02:33:28.422 --> 02:33:37.405]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:37.405 --> 02:33:41.347]  No one can deny we're living in incredibly epic times.
[02:33:41.347 --> 02:33:55.792]  Leo Zegami, I want to get your take, and then Constitutional Lawyer Robert Barnes and the other studio on Trump's Achilles' heel, our Achilles' heel, what the system's going to do, who the different power structures are, and like a game of Risk, how they're going to try to stop
[02:33:57.096 --> 02:33:59.397]  The American recovery and what's unfolding.
[02:33:59.397 --> 02:34:04.639]  And Leo, during the break you were telling me Putin just flew in to meet the Pope yesterday on July 4th.
[02:34:04.639 --> 02:34:07.500]  Who the different factions are and what's really happening.
[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:13.722]  Well he was actually sending a message to Trump by flying into Rome and visiting the Pope.
[02:34:13.722 --> 02:34:18.363]  Because you see the Pope is this very powerful figure at the moment that is
[02:34:20.704 --> 02:34:29.649]  More of a political figure than a religious one and is supporting all the way whatever the Democrats are doing or whatever the left wing is doing.
[02:34:29.649 --> 02:34:36.032]  So Putin himself has a dark agenda which people tend to forget.
[02:34:36.032 --> 02:34:44.877]  The fact that the KGB infiltrated back in the days so many seminaries and had approximately 7,000 agents that infiltrated the Catholic Church.
[02:34:45.817 --> 02:35:01.770]  And they didn't stop their operation, which is to destroy the Catholic faith and reduce it to what we see nowadays, which is basically a liberal theology nightmare full of communists, perverts, pedophiles running around.
[02:35:02.310 --> 02:35:08.192]  And wanting illegal immigrants so they can take their children and bring them in their pedophilia rings.
[02:35:08.192 --> 02:35:10.292]  It's a complete nightmare.
[02:35:10.292 --> 02:35:16.194]  And so, the fact that they met on the 4th of July was to send a message to America.
[02:35:16.194 --> 02:35:22.575]  Well, we received your message, dear elite, dear Jesuits, and we are not scared.
[02:35:22.575 --> 02:35:24.396]  That's what will be our answer.
[02:35:24.396 --> 02:35:29.697]  Because after what we saw yesterday in Washington, D.C., we are definitely not scared.
[02:35:30.831 --> 02:35:37.258]  But let's be clear, there are a lot of great Catholics, a lot of great people, a lot of great Republicans, or great Protestants.
[02:35:37.258 --> 02:35:39.180]  Catholics have nothing to do with the Pope.
[02:35:39.180 --> 02:35:41.342]  It's different factions, so explain.
[02:35:41.342 --> 02:35:49.190]  Yeah, I mean, there is factions in the Catholic Church, and Raymond Burke, for example, heads one, a more conservative faction, traditionalist.
[02:35:49.190 --> 02:35:52.734]  We've had all these American Cardinals come out and say, you can't let Islam take over Europe.
[02:35:53.354 --> 02:36:00.219]  But the moment in which you even mention that, for example, I just cited the words of Raymond Burke against Muslim immigration.
[02:36:00.219 --> 02:36:04.142]  I got blocked for 30 days on Facebook just for citing the words of a cardinal.
[02:36:04.142 --> 02:36:06.624]  I mean, it's quite incredible.
[02:36:06.624 --> 02:36:09.426]  But that demonstrates what they're doing.
[02:36:09.426 --> 02:36:16.310]  They have taken over the Catholic Church and it's not the Church of Jesus anymore.
[02:36:16.310 --> 02:36:16.731]  Exactly.
[02:36:16.731 --> 02:36:20.754]  And it's just like the universities are anti-free speech now and are hell holes.
[02:36:21.584 --> 02:36:23.690]  I mean, that's what the left takes everything over.
[02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:26.799]  And everything they take over, they use sex cult operations.
[02:36:26.799 --> 02:36:27.501]  Explain that.
[02:36:27.501 --> 02:36:29.326]  Because it's how they compromise people.
[02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:34.563]  Well, we saw the Bishop of Santa Fe bringing these illegal immigrants through.
[02:36:34.563 --> 02:36:36.144]  Yeah, let's roll some of that video while he talks.
[02:36:36.144 --> 02:36:36.965]  This happened last week.
[02:36:36.965 --> 02:36:39.827]  Bishop of Santa Fe illegally bringing people across.
[02:36:39.827 --> 02:36:41.128]  The defiant of U.S.
[02:36:41.128 --> 02:36:42.069]  laws.
[02:36:42.069 --> 02:36:44.570]  I mean, why nobody's doing anything?
[02:36:44.570 --> 02:36:53.316]  I mean, if you're a bishop, here in America, in 1776, there was the separation of church and state also.
[02:36:53.316 --> 02:36:55.938]  So we should do something about it.
[02:36:55.938 --> 02:36:57.880]  Don't you think, Alex?
[02:36:57.880 --> 02:36:58.480]  Absolutely.
[02:36:59.941 --> 02:37:02.383]  I saw that video last week.
[02:37:02.383 --> 02:37:02.803]  We played it.
[02:37:02.803 --> 02:37:05.324]  Here he is bringing thousands of people across.
[02:37:05.324 --> 02:37:05.745]  Boom!
[02:37:05.745 --> 02:37:07.726]  Breaking the border to tell the whole world, rush us!
[02:37:09.359 --> 02:37:12.521]  And of course, the victims are always the same.
[02:37:12.521 --> 02:37:13.181]  The children.
[02:37:13.181 --> 02:37:15.242]  The children that are exploited.
[02:37:15.242 --> 02:37:25.467]  And nowadays we find more and more children at the border who are not really with their real parents, but with people who take them along so they can pass through more easily.
[02:37:25.467 --> 02:37:28.788]  They get immediately inserted in pedophile rings.
[02:37:28.788 --> 02:37:34.311]  The exploitation of children today also by the LGBT community that just received
[02:37:34.771 --> 02:37:43.057]  A few days ago, Alex, the LGBT community received, one organization, a very powerful organization, received $700,000 by the U.S.
[02:37:43.057 --> 02:37:44.678]  Bishop Conference.
[02:37:44.678 --> 02:37:46.480]  How is that possible?
[02:37:46.480 --> 02:37:55.926]  How, why is the U.S., and they have this Jesuit called James Martin, who is like pro-LGBT all the way, and he is involved in it.
[02:37:55.926 --> 02:37:57.447]  So why is this U.S.
[02:37:57.447 --> 02:38:01.791]  Bishop Conference giving money to the LGBT community?
[02:38:01.791 --> 02:38:03.532]  LGBTQ or however you want to call it.
[02:38:03.792 --> 02:38:12.204]  I mean, with all due respect, the Catholic Church should be helping the poor, should be helping all those homeless people that we see flooding the cities.
[02:38:12.204 --> 02:38:19.173]  I mean, does the LGBTQ community need the money of the Catholic Church?
[02:38:19.173 --> 02:38:20.115]  I don't think so.
[02:38:21.291 --> 02:38:26.674]  And again, here it is, Texas Bishop escorts Central American migrants across border bridge to protest U.S.
[02:38:26.674 --> 02:38:28.735]  policy, and they just let him do it.
[02:38:28.735 --> 02:38:29.856]  This is the incredible arrogance.
[02:38:29.856 --> 02:38:32.797]  Let's go back to constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes.
[02:38:32.797 --> 02:38:33.498]  You can see it.
[02:38:33.498 --> 02:38:34.598]  World government, the U.N., the Vatican.
[02:38:34.598 --> 02:38:36.519]  Yeah, as a lawyer, maybe you can explain this.
[02:38:36.519 --> 02:38:42.223]  Organizing the collapse of the borders, telling us we've got to pay for everybody once they get here.
[02:38:42.223 --> 02:38:46.145]  Beto O'Rourke campaigning in Mexico for president with illegals.
[02:38:46.145 --> 02:38:48.006]  You can see the plan to break the U.S.
[02:38:48.006 --> 02:38:49.006]  up, just like the U.N.
[02:38:49.006 --> 02:38:49.867]  said they would do, Barnes.
[02:38:51.042 --> 02:38:51.442]  No doubt.
[02:38:51.442 --> 02:39:09.433]  I mean, for example, to show sort of how things are aligned or what allegiance is there, the Southern Poverty Law Center is involved in legal action against people who exposed the various church activities that were engaged in illicit criminal activities in helping illegal immigrants access the country and avoid detection.
[02:39:09.433 --> 02:39:19.939]  So here someone is doing their lawful duty, reporting criminal behavior, criminal behavior that happens to involve members of the church, and they are the ones targeted for legal action.
[02:39:20.619 --> 02:39:21.480]  They showed baseball!
[02:39:43.929 --> 02:39:44.450]  Exactly.
[02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:53.198]  They showed baseball instead, which is also a great America tradition, but there's no reason not to include the American flag from which baseball comes from.
[02:39:53.198 --> 02:39:54.479]  But they couldn't do it.
[02:39:54.479 --> 02:40:00.966]  And you have people like Congresswoman Omar, who celebrated Somalian Independence Day, but wouldn't celebrate American Independence Day.
[02:40:01.326 --> 02:40:26.850]  So that's the sort of mindset and mentality, and as we were talking about with the European Union yesterday, what you're seeing in the United States is going to the question that Leo asked, why isn't there more effort by democratic cities, by the Catholic Church, by the political left, to do something for the people that are homeless in the United States, instead of doing what Austin is doing, which is encouraging and incentivizing homelessness by legalizing it in a wide range of locations all across the city.
[02:40:27.330 --> 02:40:28.471]  The reason is very simple.
[02:40:28.471 --> 02:40:29.331]  They want disruption.
[02:40:29.331 --> 02:40:30.392]  They want chaos.
[02:40:30.392 --> 02:40:40.737]  They want to justify denationalizing police forces and creating sort of a globalized structure, an EU police and army structure in the European Union, something equivalent here in the United States.
[02:40:40.737 --> 02:40:41.177]  That's right.
[02:40:41.177 --> 02:40:43.279]  Overrun the borders, break them, and then demand a...
[02:40:44.139 --> 02:40:47.661]  A continental security perimeter for the North American Union, which is in their own documents.
[02:40:47.661 --> 02:40:52.424]  They said we'll use migrant waves, disease, and economic collapse to force it on the US and Europe.
[02:40:52.424 --> 02:40:55.085]  And now, I'm glad you brought that up because you're in another studio.
[02:40:55.085 --> 02:40:59.608]  Coming back, I'm going to show the local newscast saying Austin is adopting something stronger.
[02:41:00.598 --> 02:41:05.583]  Than Portland, or stronger than Seattle, or San Francisco, or L.A.
[02:41:05.583 --> 02:41:08.125]  Shame they can sleep in your front yard.
[02:41:08.125 --> 02:41:10.728]  That homeless from the world come here, everything's free.
[02:41:10.728 --> 02:41:13.891]  Then Democrats own the places that get the federal and state money.
[02:41:13.891 --> 02:41:17.354]  Only a part of the homeless, they make money off each homeless person.
[02:41:17.354 --> 02:41:18.735]  This is insane.
[02:41:18.735 --> 02:41:20.377]  Until you realize a larger game plan, Robert.
[02:41:21.229 --> 02:41:22.029]  Oh, exactly.
[02:41:22.029 --> 02:41:24.451]  And it all relates to things like the citizenship question.
[02:41:24.451 --> 02:41:34.617]  So I think the President actually does have a solution to that of a variety of legal scholars, including a Texas law professor, Josh Blackman, who's friends with mine.
[02:41:34.617 --> 02:41:47.564]  We've recommended a proposal to the President that I think the President can take that actually will make sure the citizenship question is included, because constitutionally under the 14th Amendment, it has to be included in order to enforce the 14th Amendment rights of states all across the country.
[02:41:47.964 --> 02:41:51.969]  So hopefully that will actually happen and occur, but it's all part of the same species.
[02:41:51.969 --> 02:41:58.636]  Trying to destroy America is part of trying to destroy nationalism, trying to destroy borders, so that power is no longer localized.
[02:41:58.636 --> 02:41:58.836]  That's it.
[02:41:58.836 --> 02:41:59.357]  It's simple.
[02:41:59.357 --> 02:42:02.340]  Multinational corporations think they're too big for their britches.
[02:42:02.861 --> 02:42:05.564]  Coming and taking over your country and buying off your politicians.
[02:42:05.564 --> 02:42:06.445]  It's real simple.
[02:42:06.445 --> 02:42:08.567]  And these idiots are like, yay, free stuff!
[02:42:08.567 --> 02:42:13.573]  This multinational, secret, Chicom-funded consortium tells me they're going to give me free stuff.
[02:42:13.573 --> 02:42:16.276]  And the Democrats are all one-upping each other.
[02:42:16.276 --> 02:42:17.477]  Everything's free.
[02:42:17.477 --> 02:42:21.322]  Homes, tuition, money, education.
[02:42:21.322 --> 02:42:22.203]  It's all free.
[02:42:22.203 --> 02:42:23.224]  Who pays for it?
[02:42:23.664 --> 02:42:33.070]  And by pushing inside America more and more South Americans who are Catholics, that means that they are incentivizing their own electorate, their own show.
[02:42:33.070 --> 02:42:34.771]  Let's be clear, leftist Catholics.
[02:42:34.771 --> 02:42:39.595]  Yeah, but they're all, nowadays, the Catholic Church is in the hands of a Pope that is Communist!
[02:42:39.595 --> 02:42:40.055]  That's it!
[02:42:40.055 --> 02:42:41.356]  You know?
[02:42:41.356 --> 02:42:47.940]  There is no real opposition, because even Raymond Burke was punished by the Pope and sent to a remote island when he was... No, it's true.
[02:42:47.940 --> 02:42:52.143]  The Antichrist has captured the Catholic Church, and every Catholic I know understands that.
[02:42:52.143 --> 02:42:52.784]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:52.784 --> 02:42:53.184]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.543 --> 02:42:56.924]  There is no longer any doubt.
[02:42:56.924 --> 02:43:02.806]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent, Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[02:43:02.806 --> 02:43:04.887]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[02:43:04.887 --> 02:43:06.447]  Already born babies are being killed.
[02:43:06.447 --> 02:43:07.588]  World government is here.
[02:43:07.588 --> 02:43:08.928]  Now is the time for decision.
[02:43:08.928 --> 02:43:11.969]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[02:43:11.969 --> 02:43:19.852]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag, and attacking the family, and that are attacking our borders, and our country, and our military, and our heritage.
[02:43:19.852 --> 02:43:22.213]  If you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[02:43:22.213 --> 02:43:24.234]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[02:43:24.474 --> 02:43:27.296]  And that means buying products at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:43:27.296 --> 02:43:29.157]  And that means praying for Infowars.
[02:43:29.157 --> 02:43:30.238]  And praying for President Trump.
[02:43:30.238 --> 02:43:31.159]  And praying for yourself.
[02:43:31.159 --> 02:43:32.220]  And praying for peace.
[02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:33.360]  Praying for justice.
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:35.682]  We're running it through July 4th, but it's got to end.

[02:44:57.028 --> 02:45:01.334]  I just want listeners to understand, money is what allows us to beat this and stand against this.
[02:45:01.334 --> 02:45:08.964]  And we're seeing a lot of orders right now with the Save Info Wars 50% off, but we make only like $5, $10 on higher marked up stuff.
[02:45:08.964 --> 02:45:11.808]  We're making like $2 on the toothpaste at that price, and we're moving it.
[02:45:12.228 --> 02:45:12.889]  I don't know.
[02:45:31.664 --> 02:45:32.625]  I like to be expanding.
[02:45:32.625 --> 02:45:33.385]  I like to be winning.
[02:45:33.385 --> 02:45:34.106]  I like to be fighting.
[02:45:34.106 --> 02:45:35.307]  And we are winning the Infowar.
[02:45:35.307 --> 02:45:36.187]  That's why we're so hated.
[02:45:36.187 --> 02:45:37.808]  But we need to be retreaded.
[02:45:37.808 --> 02:45:39.029]  We need to be tuned up.
[02:45:39.029 --> 02:45:40.070]  We need to be fixed up.
[02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:41.391]  We never have time to get it dried up.
[02:45:41.391 --> 02:45:42.932]  We got a lot of holes shot at us.
[02:45:42.932 --> 02:45:47.775]  And the enemy wants to silence us, then they're really going to plant child porn on us.
[02:45:47.775 --> 02:45:49.777]  Then they're going to kill me, or you, or anybody else.
[02:45:49.777 --> 02:45:52.619]  I mean, the Democrats now are going into a full revolutionary fervor.
[02:45:52.619 --> 02:45:54.060]  Funded by foreign banks and the Chi-Com.
[02:45:54.060 --> 02:45:55.701]  So, go to InfowarStore.com.
[02:45:56.514 --> 02:45:59.096]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[02:45:59.096 --> 02:46:06.982]  We're going into the season of war, and they have been inches from shutting down the final bank accounts we have due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[02:46:06.982 --> 02:46:10.645]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[02:46:10.645 --> 02:46:11.566]  We need to end here.
[02:46:11.566 --> 02:46:12.727]  We need to be provisioned.
[02:46:12.727 --> 02:46:17.090]  And you've got my total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[02:46:17.090 --> 02:46:21.331]  Honestly, I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[02:46:21.331 --> 02:46:23.252]  I'm bloody and then I'm up politically.
[02:46:23.252 --> 02:46:28.233]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[02:46:28.233 --> 02:46:31.534]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[02:46:31.534 --> 02:46:32.374]  I need gas.
[02:46:32.374 --> 02:46:33.895]  I need ammo politically now!
[02:46:34.295 --> 02:46:40.598]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[02:46:40.598 --> 02:46:41.718]  We're unstoppable together.
[02:46:41.718 --> 02:46:43.119]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[02:46:43.119 --> 02:46:50.162]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[02:46:50.162 --> 02:46:51.143]  You have my commitment.
[02:46:51.143 --> 02:46:59.166]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[02:46:59.166 --> 02:47:01.808]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:15.698 --> 02:47:23.344]  Paul Joseph Watson is suiting up right now to host the 4th of July from Austin, Texas.
[02:47:23.344 --> 02:47:28.047]  Broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:28.047 --> 02:47:29.168]  Look, I meant to go to calls.
[02:47:29.168 --> 02:47:32.490]  I didn't.
[02:47:32.490 --> 02:47:38.755]  But I am going to suit up with whoever wants to volunteer out there with our crew.
[02:47:38.755 --> 02:47:42.778]  And I'm going to come here to this studio tomorrow from
[02:47:46.721 --> 02:47:48.322]  Well, let's get it out of the way.
[02:47:48.322 --> 02:47:50.843]  I'll come in here at about 11 a.m.
[02:47:50.843 --> 02:47:57.206]  I think we should go live at noon tomorrow and air all of Trump's speech.
[02:47:57.206 --> 02:48:02.949]  And then if we can't, open the phones up and take people's calls about it, because it really needs to be done.
[02:48:02.949 --> 02:48:03.710]  So 11 a.m.
[02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:05.911]  Central tomorrow, special Saturday edition.
[02:48:05.911 --> 02:48:07.271]  You know, Trump's gonna be working tomorrow.
[02:48:07.271 --> 02:48:08.192]  Too much history's happening.
[02:48:08.192 --> 02:48:09.052]  I'll be here.
[02:48:09.052 --> 02:48:09.893]  And please, listeners,
[02:48:11.041 --> 02:48:20.625]  We were in the red for most of this year until the huge attacks, the Facebook ban, and the attempt to plant child porn on us and all of it.
[02:48:20.625 --> 02:48:26.688]  And listeners really saw how serious it was when they said that you can't even say my name on Facebook.
[02:48:26.688 --> 02:48:29.709]  In fact, let's show that Caitlin Bennett article from this weekend if we can.
[02:48:29.709 --> 02:48:35.452]  They banned a photo she posted with the Infowars shirt with an American flag seven months ago.
[02:48:36.311 --> 02:48:47.294]  So now they have like a pre-crime machine that goes back in time, and they said, you post any more InfoWars stuff, any more photos with it, we'll ban you.
[02:48:47.294 --> 02:48:48.974]  Think about the intimidation, think about the threats.
[02:48:48.974 --> 02:48:54.555]  Well, they can't stop you from getting a classic, this is our best-selling shirt, InfoWars in your face.
[02:48:54.555 --> 02:49:00.797]  It's navy blue, it's got a big red InfoWars.com on the front, InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:49:01.707 --> 02:49:04.690]  And again, everybody can get that shirt and check it out.
[02:49:04.690 --> 02:49:06.893]  Here, I'll pull it up for you right now.
[02:49:06.893 --> 02:49:12.318]  Again, you go to InfoWarsTore.com and you can find that article.
[02:49:12.318 --> 02:49:17.724]  You can also go to the store, InfoWarsTore.com, and you can find it.
[02:49:17.724 --> 02:49:22.029]  But the article from yesterday written by Paul Joseph Watson is
[02:49:25.979 --> 02:49:34.082]  Instagram, that's who owns Facebook, removes American flag photo because of Infowars.com in the image.
[02:49:34.082 --> 02:49:36.983]  And it's Caitlin Bennett.
[02:49:36.983 --> 02:49:39.745]  So again, think about that, folks.
[02:49:39.745 --> 02:49:45.727]  Think about the level of control that these people think that they have.
[02:49:47.236 --> 02:49:51.979]  Think about the level of arrogance and what they're going to ban next.
[02:49:51.979 --> 02:49:56.041]  The Betsy Ross flag of the abolitionist lady saying it's racist.
[02:49:56.041 --> 02:49:59.603]  In fact, I have a news clip I want to play and then get both our guests take on that.
[02:49:59.603 --> 02:50:07.407]  Here is a clip from the news with one of the usual suspect Democrats saying that this is a horrible person.
[02:50:07.407 --> 02:50:11.189]  Betsy Ross is a slave master, but she was actually an abolitionist.
[02:50:11.189 --> 02:50:12.270]  This is just incredible.
[02:50:12.270 --> 02:50:12.550]  Here it is.
[02:50:20.709 --> 02:50:23.912]  Sometimes these computers have a little bit of a hiccup, but that's alright.
[02:50:23.912 --> 02:50:25.674]  That's what happens.
[02:50:25.674 --> 02:50:27.515]  That's what happens with love.
[02:50:27.515 --> 02:50:33.661]  I want to get your take on that because we're living in a time where there's a different type of sensitivity and sensibility about race.
[02:50:34.457 --> 02:50:36.680]  Yeah, well, you know, and I was glad to see that.
[02:50:36.680 --> 02:50:43.349]  And my hope is that they didn't just do it to do it, that they understand the significance there.
[02:50:43.349 --> 02:50:47.835]  And look, there are a lot of things in our history that are still very painful.
[02:50:47.835 --> 02:50:50.559]  The Confederate flag that still flies in some places.
[02:50:51.480 --> 02:51:14.981]  And is used as a symbol and I believe that we need to move toward an inclusive America that understands that pain that doesn't wipe it away from history in the sense that it still belongs in a museum or we need to read about it and understand the significance because that's how you learn and make sure that we don't make the same mistakes in the future but does not glorify it does not celebrate it and
[02:51:15.862 --> 02:51:19.447]  Well, I mean, that is the most amazing statement from Julian Castro.
[02:51:19.447 --> 02:51:25.715]  This is the same guy that just said a week ago in the debates that we need tranny men, trans men, to be able to have abortions.
[02:51:25.715 --> 02:51:27.177]  They don't have uteruses.
[02:51:27.177 --> 02:51:32.383]  And now he goes, oh, you can have this flag in a museum, the original American flag made by an abolitionist.
[02:51:32.383 --> 02:51:33.665]  You can't glorify it.
[02:51:33.665 --> 02:51:34.046]  I mean...
[02:51:34.606 --> 02:51:35.508]  It's insane.
[02:51:35.508 --> 02:51:36.989]  Think about what this guy's saying.
[02:51:36.989 --> 02:51:40.574]  I mean... Well, we have to exercise these symbols or we'll lose it.
[02:51:40.574 --> 02:51:45.580]  And again, I'm going to do a special broadcast today just on the Caitlin Bennett article.
[02:51:45.580 --> 02:51:47.082]  I'm staying here till 6 now.
[02:51:47.082 --> 02:51:47.823]  We're going live till 7.
[02:51:47.823 --> 02:51:48.264]  I'm doing one hour.
[02:51:50.809 --> 02:51:55.413]  On the Caitlin Bennett article, newswars.com, infowars.com.
[02:51:55.413 --> 02:51:56.494]  Whole hour on it.
[02:51:56.494 --> 02:51:59.957]  Because we're going to talk about it, we're going to show it to you.
[02:51:59.957 --> 02:52:01.358]  It's at summit.news.
[02:52:01.358 --> 02:52:04.020]  It's just next level.
[02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:04.481]  Robert Barnes.
[02:52:05.677 --> 02:52:17.001]  Well, I mean, the reason why InfoWars is targeted is for the same reason that all these sort of anti-American activities are taking place by people like Congressman Castro, by people like Congresswoman Omar, by people like AOC.
[02:52:17.001 --> 02:52:22.163]  It's people who really don't love and believe in America because it's the greatest resistance to the efforts that they're trying to do.
[02:52:22.563 --> 02:52:24.264]  So InfoWars is America.
[02:52:24.264 --> 02:52:25.986]  InfoWars is Americana.
[02:52:25.986 --> 02:52:28.047]  InfoWars is Independence Day.
[02:52:28.047 --> 02:52:37.234]  InfoWars is July 4th, because it reflects and represents Americana at its core, not just protects it, defends it, as it does on a day-to-day basis.
[02:52:37.234 --> 02:52:39.596]  That's why they obsessively hate over InfoWars.
[02:52:39.596 --> 02:52:52.146]  That's why it's not a surprise they're trying to ban Caitlyn Bennett from even showing a shirt that's a pro-American shirt, just because it has a correlation with InfoWars, because in the minds of the cultural, social, political, big tech,
[02:52:52.506 --> 02:52:53.107]  I don't know.
[02:53:12.423 --> 02:53:16.066]  We've been used to being dominated by elites for thousands of years.
[02:53:16.066 --> 02:53:31.639]  Elites that had corrupted aspects of the Catholic Church, that led to the Inquisition and other atrocities, that also had led to royalty being ruled, being ruled by someone that's five years old, simply because they're the product of some incestual relationship between some royal families.
[02:53:31.639 --> 02:53:36.043]  That was how the world was ruled for almost 2,000 years, until America came along.
[02:53:36.383 --> 02:53:38.786]  And it's the idea of America, the spirit of America.
[02:53:38.786 --> 02:53:41.990]  President Trump talked about America forever, no matter what.
[02:53:41.990 --> 02:53:45.495]  And I believe what he meant was the spirit of America will be here forever.
[02:53:45.495 --> 02:53:46.396]  They can't crush it.
[02:53:46.396 --> 02:53:47.217]  They can't kill it.
[02:53:47.217 --> 02:53:48.279]  They can't destroy it.
[02:53:48.279 --> 02:53:49.420]  They can't wipe it out.
[02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:51.623]  Just as the idea of Infowars will be here forever.
[02:53:51.623 --> 02:53:52.384]  They can't crush it.
[02:53:52.384 --> 02:53:53.125]  They can't destroy it.
[02:53:53.405 --> 02:54:04.834]  Because the audience continues to support it, because the audience continues to believe in it, because the audience keeps it alive by doing things like going to Infowarsstore.com and supporting it in any and every possible way they can.
[02:54:04.834 --> 02:54:12.319]  They cannot crush the American dream and they cannot crush American liberty because it lives in the hearts and souls and minds of everyday Americans.
[02:54:12.319 --> 02:54:20.265]  And that's the great resistance against this elite effort to co-opt and coerce a different sort of behavior, an anti-Christian behavior, an anti-American behavior.
[02:54:20.265 --> 02:54:21.306]  Well, you know, Castro...
[02:54:38.291 --> 02:54:40.854]  And all these other Democrats, they work for foreign powers.
[02:54:40.854 --> 02:54:45.518]  They work for multinational corporations that set up the Euro, that set up the North American Union.
[02:54:45.518 --> 02:54:47.480]  They want to conquer countries.
[02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:48.882]  And they learn we can't do it with tanks.
[02:54:48.882 --> 02:54:49.703]  We do it politically.
[02:54:49.703 --> 02:54:50.844]  We undermine the nation.
[02:54:50.844 --> 02:54:55.769]  We teach a large group of people to hate the country they live in and to identify with the Communist Chinese.
[02:54:57.844 --> 02:55:13.881]  They identify with the communist Chinese, but they also identify with the communists in South America, like for example, some of them have even glorified Maduro, who is still in charge of Venezuela, by the way, and who hasn't been
[02:55:16.104 --> 02:55:21.707]  Let's say, put aside, because he's protected by Pope Francis and by Russia.
[02:55:21.707 --> 02:55:29.330]  So this gives you an idea of who is behind the scenes defending these globalist stooges of the left.
[02:55:29.330 --> 02:55:35.353]  So I think that a guy like Castro should be ashamed for what he said, but he doesn't have any sense of shame.
[02:55:35.353 --> 02:55:37.834]  That's the problem with left-wingers.
[02:55:37.834 --> 02:55:43.997]  They are just adamant in going and pursuing this anti-American ideology.
[02:55:45.020 --> 02:55:49.304]  And of course you've got this Castro guy who served the Obama administration running for president.
[02:55:49.304 --> 02:55:51.105]  There's his bio right there on screen.
[02:55:51.105 --> 02:55:56.210]  Now let's play that clip I mentioned earlier, or I'll give you time, just give me a thumbs up when you got it.
[02:55:56.210 --> 02:55:59.452]  He came out, because I don't want to just mention this, I want to play it and we're going to talk about it.
[02:55:59.452 --> 02:56:08.520]  He said that, oh we don't just want women to have the right to abortion, we want trans men to have the right to have abortions.
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:10.502]  So a man doesn't have a uterus.
[02:56:12.056 --> 02:56:16.537]  But he wants to make you accept this, and the crowd goes, woo!
[02:56:16.537 --> 02:56:17.517]  I mean, this is exciting.
[02:56:17.517 --> 02:56:18.417]  Here it is.
[02:56:18.417 --> 02:56:20.518]  To universal health care.
[02:56:20.518 --> 02:56:22.958]  Secretary Castro, this one is for you.
[02:56:22.958 --> 02:56:25.559]  All of you on stage support a woman's right to an abortion.
[02:56:25.559 --> 02:56:29.300]  You all support some version of a government health care option.
[02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:32.801]  Would your plan cover abortion, Mr. Secretary?
[02:56:32.801 --> 02:56:33.941]  Yes, it would.
[02:56:33.941 --> 02:56:37.202]  I don't believe only in reproductive freedom.
[02:56:37.202 --> 02:56:38.622]  I believe in reproductive justice.
[02:56:40.717 --> 02:56:41.238]  Justice!
[02:56:41.238 --> 02:56:41.959]  Kill that baby!
[02:56:41.959 --> 02:56:53.876]  What that means is that just because a woman or let's also not forget someone in the trans community a trans female is poor doesn't mean they shouldn't have...
[02:56:55.011 --> 02:56:57.032]  ...exercise that right to choose.
[02:56:57.032 --> 02:57:00.193]  And so I absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion.
[02:57:00.193 --> 02:57:12.097]  More than that, everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today, a person's right to choose is under assault in places like Missouri, in Alabama... Oh, stop right there.
[02:57:12.097 --> 02:57:13.437]  By the way, we didn't edit that.
[02:57:13.437 --> 02:57:14.277]  That's a computer glitch.
[02:57:14.277 --> 02:57:15.598]  We're gonna re-download that clip.
[02:57:16.442 --> 02:57:18.942]  I'm going to re-download it, because I want everybody to know, we didn't edit that.
[02:57:18.942 --> 02:57:23.243]  He actually said, a trans man has a right to abortion.
[02:57:23.243 --> 02:57:25.644]  Well, I'm still recovering from that.
[02:57:25.644 --> 02:57:30.645]  That evening when I saw this scene, and I wrote it the day after on my social media.
[02:57:30.645 --> 02:57:32.105]  I mean, it's unheard of.
[02:57:32.105 --> 02:57:37.106]  I mean, he must be in some twilight zone where men are capable of giving birth.
[02:57:37.106 --> 02:57:39.506]  But actually, they are pushing that agenda, you know.
[02:57:39.506 --> 02:57:40.126]  It's an overthrow reality.
[02:57:40.126 --> 02:57:42.667]  Let's come back and finish with both you guys and Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:57:42.667 --> 02:57:43.167]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.230 --> 02:57:46.551]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[02:57:46.551 --> 02:57:47.331]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[02:57:47.331 --> 02:57:47.892]  Thanks for holding.
[02:57:47.892 --> 02:57:48.432]  Hey, Alex.
[02:57:48.432 --> 02:57:51.254]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[02:57:51.254 --> 02:57:57.378]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[02:57:57.378 --> 02:58:06.164]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[02:58:06.164 --> 02:58:07.324]  That's it.
[02:58:07.324 --> 02:58:09.966]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[02:58:09.966 --> 02:58:12.828]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[02:58:12.828 --> 02:58:14.129]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[02:58:14.269 --> 02:58:15.029]  I agree entirely.
[02:58:15.029 --> 02:58:20.472]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[02:58:20.472 --> 02:58:23.253]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[02:58:23.253 --> 02:58:25.313]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[02:58:25.313 --> 02:58:34.577]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[02:58:34.577 --> 02:58:36.478]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[02:58:36.478 --> 02:58:42.961]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[02:58:42.961 --> 02:58:43.901]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:58:46.992 --> 02:58:51.840]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[02:58:53.140 --> 02:59:02.546]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[02:59:02.546 --> 02:59:14.193]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[02:59:14.193 --> 02:59:18.396]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[02:59:19.296 --> 02:59:23.339]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[02:59:23.339 --> 02:59:30.243]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[02:59:30.243 --> 02:59:33.165]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[02:59:33.165 --> 02:59:42.850]  Sign up for auto-ship and get your own high-quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:59:48.695 --> 03:00:04.108]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:04.108 --> 03:00:05.950]  Robert Barnes earlier brought this up.
[03:00:05.950 --> 03:00:07.111]  We see the same thing with Europe.
[03:00:07.111 --> 03:00:12.035]  Giant migrant camps everywhere, up to 90% of people five years later don't have jobs or homeless.
[03:00:12.035 --> 03:00:13.876]  Rioting, stabbing people.
[03:00:13.876 --> 03:00:15.398]  My own son, Rex Jones.
[03:00:15.398 --> 03:00:16.699]  News from Spanish.
[03:00:19.016 --> 03:00:34.491]  Kids three years ago that stayed at his mother's house when he was there part-time from Spain who were exchange students and his friend that he still talks to on the internet every week is in the hospital fighting for his life in Madrid stabbed by a North African migrant for no reason.
[03:00:35.606 --> 03:00:38.789]  Stabbed a few of his other friends, just walked up to him at a bus stop, started stabbing.
[03:00:38.789 --> 03:00:40.411]  Of course, the police aren't even going to charge him.
[03:00:40.411 --> 03:00:42.873]  They just, they said there's so many we can't stop it.
[03:00:42.873 --> 03:00:44.755]  They block roads, they rape, they kill.
[03:00:44.755 --> 03:00:45.936]  What's the larger plan?
[03:00:45.936 --> 03:00:52.101]  Here's an Austin newscast where they say they can sleep basically in your front yard or anywhere else except the city council building.
[03:00:52.101 --> 03:00:52.402]  Here it is.
[03:00:53.404 --> 03:00:57.827]  There are several other major cities that allow camping within city limits.
[03:00:57.827 --> 03:01:01.889]  In Seattle, camping is also legal except in parks.
[03:01:01.889 --> 03:01:12.155]  In San Francisco, an appeals court ruled last year that cities could not criminalize people for sleeping or camping in public areas if shelter isn't available.
[03:01:12.155 --> 03:01:17.138]  And in Portland, camping is only banned on public property and public rights of way.
[03:01:17.538 --> 03:01:25.792]  Now we'll have to establish that the underlying conduct posed a hazard or a danger to someone before we can take any action.
[03:01:25.792 --> 03:01:31.162]  As KXAN's Eugene Schill found out, that last part about camping still has many people worried.
[03:01:32.119 --> 03:01:50.523]  Police Chief Brian Manley told the City Council, under these new changes, if you set up a tent, say here on Congress Avenue, police cannot make you move as long as you're not blocking the public right of way, an entrance to a business, or as long as you're not posing safety risks to yourself or others.
[03:01:50.523 --> 03:01:55.864]  This is about the next student who will be groped, followed, assaulted, or possibly murdered in the West Campus area.
[03:01:56.084 --> 03:01:57.425]  We were chased.
[03:01:57.425 --> 03:02:00.147]  It's not pleasant to be so frightened.
[03:02:00.147 --> 03:02:06.090]  Some people worry about safety and what will happen to downtown streets since people can now set up tents without getting sighted.
[03:02:06.090 --> 03:02:14.475]  But the mayor says the city manager has been directed to come up with guidelines later this summer for safe places to camp and other solutions for homelessness.
[03:02:14.475 --> 03:02:17.938]  He doesn't think a tent city will be an issue in the meantime.
[03:02:17.938 --> 03:02:22.821]  I just don't think we're going to see that kind of thing happen over an eight-week period of time.
[03:02:22.821 --> 03:02:24.842]  If it does, then there's going to be a lot that we're going to...
[03:02:25.402 --> 03:02:26.943]  I want to get Zoghami's quick take on this.
[03:02:26.943 --> 03:02:31.065]  You're going to be back on with the War Room and Owen Schroyer today.
[03:02:31.065 --> 03:02:33.085]  Well, in Europe we have this happening for years.
[03:02:33.085 --> 03:02:38.708]  My wife who is here in the studio, she's been harassed by North Africans for the last 10 years living in Italy all the time.
[03:02:38.708 --> 03:02:43.730]  I mean, I leave her in the car alone and I go to a shop and they will start knocking on the car.
[03:02:43.730 --> 03:02:48.312]  She will go on her own and at one point they will stop her in the middle of the street.
[03:02:48.312 --> 03:02:50.213]  It was just, I mean, it was insane.
[03:02:50.213 --> 03:02:51.914]  It's their third world, they're virtuous.
[03:02:52.934 --> 03:02:53.995]  I don't care.
[03:02:53.995 --> 03:02:55.536]  I'm joking.
[03:02:55.536 --> 03:02:56.977]  I know, I know, I know.
[03:02:56.977 --> 03:03:00.700]  And they'll just let them do whatever they want.
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:02.001]  It's just like insane.
[03:03:02.001 --> 03:03:04.022]  So why is the left doing it?
[03:03:04.022 --> 03:03:06.844]  To destroy the very fabric of the West.
[03:03:06.844 --> 03:03:08.986]  To destroy our families.
[03:03:08.986 --> 03:03:15.590]  To incentivate the sense of isolation that brings also these people to become homeless.
[03:03:15.590 --> 03:03:21.074]  Because... A lot of them are from the US, they're all on drugs, they're all... It's a whole culture now.
[03:03:21.074 --> 03:03:21.975]  Barnes, where does this go?
[03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:25.702]  Well, no place good unless the President is successful.
[03:03:25.702 --> 03:03:33.148]  That's what Leo said earlier, that President Trump is the main area of resistance to this sort of globalist agenda.
[03:03:33.148 --> 03:03:38.092]  Now, there's been other successes politically in Italy, as he's talked about.
[03:03:38.092 --> 03:03:40.855]  There's been successes in the EU elections for the Brexit Party.
[03:03:40.855 --> 03:03:43.216]  There's been successes in Brexit itself.
[03:03:43.216 --> 03:03:44.998]  But you see all the resistance that's been done.
[03:03:44.998 --> 03:03:47.240]  I mean, the UK cannot put into place
[03:03:47.700 --> 03:03:48.520]  We're good.
[03:04:07.006 --> 03:04:08.647]  Support the President's efforts?
[03:04:08.647 --> 03:04:25.238]  Because that is the bulwark against these assaults and attacks from the global elites and the political establishment that wants to end the mere idea of nationhood and undermine the mere ideal of Christianity by attacking our very history that the President so successfully celebrated yesterday.
[03:04:25.238 --> 03:04:26.119]  Well said, Barnes.
[03:04:26.119 --> 03:04:27.880]  Well said, Leo Zegami at leozegami.com.
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:30.361]  You're going to be on the War Room coming up.
[03:04:30.361 --> 03:04:32.243]  I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:32.243 --> 03:04:33.143]  I'll be back tomorrow, noon.
[03:04:34.724 --> 03:04:37.446]  For at least a two-hour special broadcast, and I think I'm doing more tonight.
[03:04:37.446 --> 03:04:40.248]  In fact, I'm just doing 20 hours this weekend.
[03:04:40.248 --> 03:04:41.169]  We're not giving up.
[03:04:41.169 --> 03:04:42.730]  We're dug in and we're winning.
[03:04:42.730 --> 03:04:45.733]  But we're going to fight even harder now to ensure that victory.
[03:04:45.733 --> 03:04:51.397]  Paul Joseph Watson, from England, absolutely ready to launch, is live in 60 seconds.
[03:04:53.780 --> 03:04:54.381]  I agree.
[03:04:54.381 --> 03:04:57.523]  Briefly, folks, please do not forget this is the maximum alert.
[03:04:57.523 --> 03:04:58.684]  We wouldn't be here without you.
[03:04:58.684 --> 03:05:00.085]  I thank you for your support and your help.
[03:05:00.085 --> 03:05:01.706]  We're going to be steadfast in this fight.
[03:05:01.706 --> 03:05:06.370]  We need financial support and we're going to put up more prominent donate buttons at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:05:06.370 --> 03:05:08.212]  You want to just give us straight donations.
[03:05:08.212 --> 03:05:08.792]  There's a P.O.
[03:05:08.792 --> 03:05:10.033]  box if you want to mail us a check.
[03:05:10.033 --> 03:05:11.855]  We will put it into the fight against these globalists.
[03:05:11.855 --> 03:05:14.857]  We need money to fight back and to let them know we're taking action.
[03:05:15.057 --> 03:05:16.118]  to defend ourselves.
[03:05:16.118 --> 03:05:19.021]  InfoWarsStore.com is the main page.

[03:05:37.895 --> 03:05:38.655]  We're not going to back down.
[03:05:56.041 --> 03:05:57.221]  Big Brother.
[03:05:57.221 --> 03:05:58.262]  Mainstream media.
[03:05:58.262 --> 03:06:00.922]  Government cover-ups.
[03:06:00.922 --> 03:06:02.603]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:06:02.603 --> 03:06:04.263]  Well, so does he.
[03:06:04.263 --> 03:06:09.365]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:09.365 --> 03:06:12.446]  Get your motor running.
[03:06:12.446 --> 03:06:14.486]  Head out on the highway.
[03:06:14.486 --> 03:06:18.647]  Looking for adventure.
[03:06:18.647 --> 03:06:20.308]  In whatever comes our way.
[03:06:22.509 --> 03:06:29.855]  Well, I gotta tell ya...
[03:06:31.311 --> 03:06:35.693]  We don't script what we talk about here, my host, my guest host, my crew.
[03:06:35.693 --> 03:06:42.975]  We all have different views, but in general, we love freedom, we love justice, and we love the Renaissance, and we love humanity.
[03:06:42.975 --> 03:06:44.416]  We believe in a pro-human future.
[03:06:44.416 --> 03:06:46.436]  Paul Watts is taking over here in just a minute or two.
[03:06:46.436 --> 03:06:53.699]  But I gotta tell you right now, we're gonna be playing a lot of excerpts from the war room of Trump's amazing historic speech.
[03:06:53.699 --> 03:06:55.860]  I'm coming in here tomorrow at noon central.
[03:06:56.874 --> 03:06:59.375]  So it'll just be a live feed, internet only.
[03:06:59.375 --> 03:07:06.976]  Infowars.com, forward slash show, front page, re-airing of Trump's speech with analysis and history.
[03:07:06.976 --> 03:07:19.299]  So be sure and join us at 12 noon tomorrow, Central Standard Time, for a live retransmission of the speech, because it was a new declaration of independence.
[03:07:19.299 --> 03:07:20.319]  It was a, it was a,
[03:07:21.167 --> 03:07:27.353]  Exorcism of the left and their hatred of America, their attack on it was unprecedented and insane.
[03:07:27.353 --> 03:07:29.855]  We have got to make a big deal out of this because it is.
[03:07:29.855 --> 03:07:31.577]  And listen, the listeners get it.
[03:07:31.577 --> 03:07:33.558]  I'm seeing the comments.
[03:07:33.558 --> 03:07:36.581]  We're getting the calls, the emails coming in.
[03:07:36.581 --> 03:07:39.624]  People are excited.
[03:07:39.624 --> 03:07:43.988]  And I didn't get into all the other articles that Paul's written today.
[03:07:43.988 --> 03:07:46.990]  New trend of tampering with food products by putting them back
[03:07:47.967 --> 03:07:52.009]  It's going viral by leftist men dressed as women.
[03:07:52.009 --> 03:07:53.369]  They come and they spit in your mouth.
[03:07:53.369 --> 03:07:57.311]  Watch the lick and spit in your ice cream.
[03:07:57.311 --> 03:07:59.492]  It's just total degradation.
[03:07:59.492 --> 03:08:06.155]  Also, new leftist trends of women on YouTube bathing in water and then men buying pints of it.
[03:08:06.155 --> 03:08:09.296]  People say, oh, you're just click baiting, focusing on the, you know, the degenerate.
[03:08:09.296 --> 03:08:11.637]  No, this is the main operating system of the left.
[03:08:12.742 --> 03:08:18.588]  The average leftist says it's fun to kill babies, kill those little pieces of crap, beat them up, assault them, get them.
[03:08:18.588 --> 03:08:19.969]  We've played the clips.
[03:08:19.969 --> 03:08:23.052]  They have converted to pure evil.
[03:08:23.052 --> 03:08:23.813]  But beyond that...
[03:08:26.385 --> 03:08:33.872]  If they were just gonna stop with banning Infowars.com or Alex Jones on Facebook, Twitter, Google, it wouldn't be that big a deal.
[03:08:33.872 --> 03:08:40.518]  But obviously, China's already banned Winnie the Pooh making fun of their dictator, or the Taiwanese flag, and big techs worked with them.
[03:08:40.518 --> 03:08:47.424]  Well this article, up on summit.news, Paul's site, Infowars.com, and newswars.com is so critical.
[03:08:47.424 --> 03:08:49.987]  We could put it on screen and show you all the screenshots in there.
[03:08:51.547 --> 03:09:01.203]  Where it has the information and it has the posting from Instagram owned by Facebook.
[03:09:06.021 --> 03:09:08.282]  And they say, community guidelines.
[03:09:08.282 --> 03:09:16.285]  We want to keep Instagram a safe place for everyone and we created these guidelines to support and protect our community on Instagram.
[03:09:16.285 --> 03:09:23.688]  And it's a blurred out picture of Caitlyn Bennett and the American flag in an InfoWars shirt from seven months ago.
[03:09:23.688 --> 03:09:28.730]  And now they want to ban the Betsy Ross flag when she was an abolitionist.
[03:09:28.730 --> 03:09:31.491]  That means free the slaves.
[03:09:31.491 --> 03:09:33.852]  But does it matter to Mr. Castro?
[03:09:35.404 --> 03:09:38.206]  He says that men deserve to have abortions, too.
[03:09:38.206 --> 03:09:39.367]  Yes, he said that.
[03:09:39.367 --> 03:09:44.150]  And he said that the flag should be in a museum, not publicly on Nike tennis shoes.
[03:09:44.150 --> 03:09:47.412]  These people want the power to control what symbols you can have.
[03:09:47.412 --> 03:09:58.399]  That's why we're selling a new special edition shirt in navy blue and in white that is the Betsy Ross original continental flag.
[03:09:58.399 --> 03:10:00.260]  And under it, these colors don't run.
[03:10:00.260 --> 03:10:02.542]  And on the back,
[03:10:05.143 --> 03:10:07.705]  On the back, it says, America's Back.
[03:10:07.705 --> 03:10:15.590]  There's another version that says, The Spirit of 1776, established in 1776, under the flag.
[03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:20.854]  And on the back, it has the same message of, America's Back, Infowars.com.
[03:10:20.854 --> 03:10:22.195]  This is an awesome shirt.
[03:10:23.375 --> 03:10:26.657]  You need to wear this proud and it funds our operation.
[03:10:26.657 --> 03:10:27.598]  They're being printed right now.
[03:10:27.598 --> 03:10:28.819]  They'll ship out in a week.
[03:10:28.819 --> 03:10:30.000]  Two weeks for delivery.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:34.763]  Get your special edition shirt and trigger these leftists everywhere.
[03:10:34.763 --> 03:10:36.884]  And we have to end the specials this weekend.
[03:10:36.884 --> 03:10:37.785]  Storewide free shipping.
[03:10:37.785 --> 03:10:39.226]  3% off all the supplements.
[03:10:40.197 --> 03:10:41.918]  And double patriot points.
[03:10:41.918 --> 03:10:54.623]  And either Wednesday or Thursday, I'll be announcing later this afternoon, we're going to do a 36-hour broadcast, 1776 worldwide, to coincide with Trump's summit.
[03:10:54.623 --> 03:10:59.465]  Trump's summit coming up on the 11th, where he's going to go after the censors.
[03:10:59.465 --> 03:11:01.166]  So that's all coming up.
[03:11:01.166 --> 03:11:01.486]  All right.
[03:11:01.486 --> 03:11:02.547]  Thank you all for your support.
[03:11:02.547 --> 03:11:03.227]  You're amazing.
[03:11:04.628 --> 03:11:06.068]  Great things are happening.
[03:11:06.068 --> 03:11:07.009]  The battle is joined.
[03:11:07.009 --> 03:11:11.890]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson with so much news to cover, it makes my head spin.
[03:11:11.890 --> 03:11:16.012]  And then in about 50 minutes, Owen Troyer in the War Room with Leo Zegami in studio.
[03:11:16.012 --> 03:11:18.512]  Paul Watson.
[03:11:18.512 --> 03:11:19.093]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:11:19.093 --> 03:11:32.357]  Yeah, we're still looking at this big story that's linked up on DrudgeReport.com about the attendance and the lies that the media told about the, quote, poorly attended 4th of July parade in D.C.
[03:11:32.357 --> 03:11:32.877]  yesterday.
[03:11:33.795 --> 03:11:44.481]  AOC has put out a tweet in the last few hours that says, Trump spent millions on a poorly attended one-day parade.
[03:11:44.481 --> 03:11:48.483]  They are still claiming that this was poorly attended.
[03:11:48.483 --> 03:11:58.088]  Okay, I saw on Twitter earlier under the trending hashtag Trump Parade Fail or whatever it was earlier on, dozens of people
[03:11:59.033 --> 03:12:02.856]  Dozens of leftists claiming, first of all, that it was poorly attended.
[03:12:02.856 --> 03:12:15.806]  When people posted screenshots of the thousands and thousands of people lined up all the way down the National Mall, they claimed those photos were photoshopped, were faked.
[03:12:15.806 --> 03:12:20.590]  I literally linked one direct from CNN with a link to the CNN article.
[03:12:20.590 --> 03:12:21.891]  It was a CNN photo.
[03:12:21.891 --> 03:12:23.512]  I think it was that one right there.
[03:12:24.807 --> 03:12:26.908]  Oh, so CNN's photoshopping this.
[03:12:26.908 --> 03:12:33.369]  She's literally out claiming, after claiming that, you know, there were concentration camps, that migrants were drinking toilet water.
[03:12:33.369 --> 03:12:36.030]  Complete, absolute hysterical nonsense.
[03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:39.551]  Now that this was a poorly attended parade.
[03:12:39.551 --> 03:12:42.352]  You have ABC.
[03:12:42.352 --> 03:12:44.473]  ABC News put out a tweet.
[03:12:44.473 --> 03:12:51.155]  After this event, wild weather, small crowds and protesters rain on Trump's parade.
[03:12:51.155 --> 03:12:52.655]  Did you see the comparison?
[03:12:53.351 --> 03:12:59.293]  Between the Trump baby-bloon protesters and the actual attendees for the rally.
[03:12:59.293 --> 03:13:04.554]  Oh, it's literally like six or seven protesters with this Trump baby-bloon.
[03:13:04.554 --> 03:13:07.955]  You saw the Antifa protesters burning the flag.
[03:13:07.955 --> 03:13:09.235]  Again, it was a gaggle.
[03:13:09.235 --> 03:13:09.955]  It was no more than 12.
[03:13:09.955 --> 03:13:16.637]  They're literally saying that the protests were comparable to the actual people who attended the event.
[03:13:17.828 --> 03:13:19.389]  Again, ABC News.
[03:13:19.389 --> 03:13:23.811]  Wild weather, small crowds and protesters rain on Trump's parade.
[03:13:23.811 --> 03:13:26.413]  Small crowds?
[03:13:26.413 --> 03:13:31.075]  If that's a small crowd, I mean, what do they expect?
[03:13:31.075 --> 03:13:38.299]  John Cooper, former Barack Obama campaign chair, put out a tweet.
[03:13:38.299 --> 03:13:42.001]  Trump's event in DC today has drawn an embarrassingly small crowd.
[03:13:44.580 --> 03:13:48.121]  This was after the event, after all these photos came out.
[03:13:48.121 --> 03:13:55.363]  This individual who put out this tweet said that they turned off the webcam on the National Mall because no one was there.
[03:13:55.363 --> 03:14:00.965]  That was before the event started, at a distance well away from it.
[03:14:00.965 --> 03:14:04.406]  In fact, I posted the picture directly under this tweet.
[03:14:04.406 --> 03:14:05.486]  Again, you had the Guardian.
[03:14:05.486 --> 03:14:07.626]  There you go, there's the actual attendance.
[03:14:07.626 --> 03:14:08.947]  You had the Guardian.
[03:14:08.947 --> 03:14:12.948]  White House struggles to draw crowds to Trump's 4th of July show.
[03:14:14.835 --> 03:14:19.904]  If that's struggling, then, you know, absolutely incredible.
[03:14:19.904 --> 03:14:21.687]  What else do we have here?
[03:14:21.687 --> 03:14:26.435]  We had the media beforehand, as we've got in the article up on Summit News.
[03:14:27.139 --> 03:14:33.042]  The Independent reporting Trump officials fear embarrassingly tiny crowd for his 4th of July speech.
[03:14:33.042 --> 03:14:35.004]  Again, you read into that article.
[03:14:35.004 --> 03:14:39.226]  Okay, so what officials fear embarrassingly tiny crowds?
[03:14:39.226 --> 03:14:39.986]  Do you have a quote?
[03:14:39.986 --> 03:14:41.527]  No, there was literally nothing.
[03:14:41.527 --> 03:14:44.429]  There were no officials who feared anything.
[03:14:44.429 --> 03:14:48.111]  And as you can see from the photos, it was not a tiny crowd.
[03:14:49.071 --> 03:14:55.816]  Absolutely incredible level of deception that they'll literally go on there and claim that it was poorly attended.
[03:14:55.816 --> 03:14:57.417]  And Paul, let me just interrupt briefly.
[03:14:57.417 --> 03:14:58.938]  Let me just throw this in briefly.
[03:14:58.938 --> 03:15:01.360]  Remember the inauguration almost three years ago?
[03:15:01.360 --> 03:15:04.002]  They showed the gates when they first opened and said no one was there.
[03:15:04.002 --> 03:15:06.143]  And then said Trump was crazy, no one was there.
[03:15:06.143 --> 03:15:09.466]  Remember those photos from the Washington Monument?
[03:15:09.466 --> 03:15:13.769]  Where they showed it when it only first opened on CNN, PBS, they all did it.
[03:15:14.629 --> 03:15:20.716]  They all said, oh look, hardly any crowd, even though the gates had just opened and Antifa was trying to keep people from going in.
[03:15:20.716 --> 03:15:24.340]  There's no end to this.
[03:15:24.340 --> 03:15:27.804]  Oh, they literally had webcams set up hours before.
[03:15:27.804 --> 03:15:31.729]  And then these leftists on Twitter took screenshots and said, oh look, nobody's turned up.
[03:15:32.409 --> 03:15:35.852]  They're literally claiming that CNN is now faking photos of this.
[03:15:35.852 --> 03:15:37.953]  This is the level of hysteria.
[03:15:37.953 --> 03:15:45.199]  They just need to admit, to take the L, to admit that this was a very well attended event, it was a great success, the speech was great.
[03:15:45.199 --> 03:15:46.500]  Give Trump the win.
[03:15:46.500 --> 03:15:47.381]  Just accept it.
[03:15:47.381 --> 03:15:49.442]  Stop being hysterical morons.
[03:15:49.442 --> 03:15:50.103]  We'll be back.
[03:15:50.103 --> 03:15:50.983]  Summit.News.
[03:15:50.983 --> 03:15:51.464]  Now go away.

[03:17:34.410 --> 03:17:34.490]  800-600-3388.
[03:17:34.490 --> 03:17:35.671]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners.
[03:17:35.671 --> 03:17:37.431]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[03:17:37.431 --> 03:17:39.692]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[03:17:54.124 --> 03:17:55.445]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:17:55.445 --> 03:17:56.165]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:17:56.165 --> 03:17:56.785]  Thanks for holding.
[03:17:56.785 --> 03:17:57.326]  Hey, Alex.
[03:17:57.326 --> 03:18:00.147]  Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:18:00.147 --> 03:18:06.251]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:18:06.251 --> 03:18:15.056]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[03:18:15.056 --> 03:18:16.216]  That's it.
[03:18:16.216 --> 03:18:18.878]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:18:18.878 --> 03:18:21.719]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:18:21.719 --> 03:18:23.000]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[03:18:23.160 --> 03:18:23.920]  I agree entirely.
[03:18:23.920 --> 03:18:29.363]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:18:29.363 --> 03:18:32.144]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:18:32.144 --> 03:18:34.224]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:18:34.224 --> 03:18:43.468]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:18:43.468 --> 03:18:45.369]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[03:18:45.369 --> 03:18:51.852]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:18:51.852 --> 03:18:52.792]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:18:55.029 --> 03:18:59.191]  I want to encourage everyone to take advantage of the huge July 4th specials.
[03:18:59.191 --> 03:19:01.953]  We're running right through into next weekend, but then they've got to stop.

[03:19:35.586 --> 03:19:38.087]  Most of those are close to selling out.
[03:19:38.087 --> 03:19:39.607]  Some won't be back in for months.
[03:19:39.607 --> 03:19:40.867]  Many won't be back in for weeks.
[03:19:40.867 --> 03:19:44.748]  But regardless, fish oil for adults, for children, the very best out there.
[03:19:44.748 --> 03:19:45.869]  All of these are great products.
[03:19:45.869 --> 03:19:48.969]  Books, films, t-shirts, water filtration, air filtration.
[03:19:48.969 --> 03:19:52.010]  That's what funds the info war and the big sales running right now.
[03:19:57.614 --> 03:20:10.905]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:10.905 --> 03:20:12.146]  You found it.
[03:20:12.146 --> 03:20:14.208]  The tip of the spear.
[03:20:14.208 --> 03:20:17.190]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.190 --> 03:20:21.153]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:41.073 --> 03:20:45.334]  Yeah, we're talking about the crowd sizes at the July 4th event yesterday.
[03:20:45.334 --> 03:20:46.815]  AOC is out lying about it.
[03:20:46.815 --> 03:20:49.415]  ABC News is out lying about it.
[03:20:49.415 --> 03:20:53.537]  The former campaign chair for Barack Obama is lying about it.
[03:20:53.537 --> 03:21:00.178]  Either they're saying that the photographs were photoshopped even when they're literally on CNN.com.
[03:21:00.178 --> 03:21:09.501]  Now AOC has come out with a new tweet and they did a similar thing back for the inauguration back in 2017 where actually CNN itself initially
[03:21:10.498 --> 03:21:20.585]  put out these photos from the inauguration of Trump comparing it to Obama in 2009, claiming that the Trump inauguration was basically empty.
[03:21:20.585 --> 03:21:36.657]  Then they debunked themselves and released a massive picture, it was like a million gigapixel picture or something, from CNN, where you could zoom out and see that the crowd stretched back all the way down the National Mall.
[03:21:37.259 --> 03:21:52.524]  And in fact, if you look at mall attendance at the Trump inauguration by the American thinker, they've got a direct link to that billion pixel interactive photograph, which is what you're seeing right now.
[03:21:52.524 --> 03:21:59.226]  But you can move around, you can zoom, and you can see that the crowd in the mall goes all the way back to the Washington Monument.
[03:21:59.750 --> 03:22:12.862]  This was a CNN picture which they released after claiming that Sean Spicer, the then press secretary, was lying about the attendance of Trump's inauguration back in 2017.
[03:22:12.862 --> 03:22:21.630]  Now, I don't doubt for a second that Barack Obama had a larger attendance for the inauguration of the first black president in 2009.
[03:22:22.931 --> 03:22:33.333]  But to claim that it was basically half empty when Trump was inaugurated, which is what the media did, was completely erroneous based on their own picture, which you saw right there.
[03:22:33.333 --> 03:22:43.095]  But now they've gone even further and claimed that this was poorly attended when it was clearly extremely well attended despite the weather.
[03:22:43.095 --> 03:22:52.397]  And they're actually trying to compare the protests and saying like that was anywhere near in comparison of the protesters rained on Trump's parade.
[03:22:52.857 --> 03:22:56.579]  There were literally like seven of them with the Trump balloon.
[03:22:56.579 --> 03:23:01.120]  There were literally a gaggle of 12 Antifa burning the American flag.
[03:23:01.120 --> 03:23:05.482]  The people who threw it at the Secret Service agent got arrested.
[03:23:05.482 --> 03:23:08.704]  It was an absolutely pathetic protest.
[03:23:08.704 --> 03:23:10.804]  But they're saying that it was comparable.
[03:23:10.804 --> 03:23:17.047]  Once again, caught in a flagrant act of complete deception, which is why, moving on to this next report,
[03:23:18.408 --> 03:23:25.173]  Media faces 12,000 job cuts, most since 2009 economic crash.
[03:23:25.173 --> 03:23:37.321]  So despite the good job numbers today, which came out earlier this morning, the American media will be hit with nearly 12,000 job cuts in 2019, the highest number since the economic crisis of 2009.
[03:23:38.737 --> 03:23:50.350]  And again, that is the main reason, or one of them at least, why they're desperately trying to de-platform, to silence, to put out of business their competition because they're all losing their jobs.
[03:23:50.350 --> 03:23:55.655]  We saw a few weeks ago, CNN had to cut a bunch of its health department staff.
[03:23:55.655 --> 03:23:59.840]  They had to basically wipe out their London bureau because of these cuts.
[03:24:00.606 --> 03:24:12.710]  And now the consultancy Challenger Grey and Christmas reported this week media companies which include movies, television, publishing, music and broadcast and print news announced plans to cut 15,474 jobs so far this year of which 11,878 are from news organisations.
[03:24:20.413 --> 03:24:32.420]  This is a huge increase over 2017's 4,026 media job cuts, and according to the article at least, this is primarily happening due to paywalls and ad revenue.
[03:24:32.420 --> 03:24:40.545]  So again, Washington Post and all these big news outlets are having to survive by going behind a paywall.
[03:24:40.545 --> 03:24:43.627]  Many a time you'll see a Washington Post article linked up on Drudge.
[03:24:43.627 --> 03:24:45.348]  You click through, you try to read it.
[03:24:45.348 --> 03:24:46.729]  You can't read it without paying.
[03:24:47.785 --> 03:24:56.871]  And that's the only way they can survive with a very diminished audience, but at least an audience that's paying some money, because they can't generate that money anywhere else.
[03:24:56.871 --> 03:25:00.694]  And that again is why they're having to de-platform everyone else.
[03:25:00.694 --> 03:25:07.738]  Already this year, CNN BuzzFeed had slashed over 100 and 200 jobs respectively.
[03:25:07.738 --> 03:25:12.882]  Verizon slashed 800 jobs at Yahoo, AOL and Huffington Post.
[03:25:12.882 --> 03:25:15.824]  And as John Nolte points out in this Breitbart article,
[03:25:17.580 --> 03:25:28.523]  The reason they're slashing jobs, the reason that they're losing this resonance with the American public, is because they lie over and over again, as they did with the crowds at the July 4th parade yesterday.
[03:25:28.523 --> 03:25:34.225]  He lists some examples of prominent hoaxes that the media has carried forward in the last few years.
[03:25:34.225 --> 03:25:37.466]  Hispanic George Zimmerman, the white racist killer.
[03:25:37.466 --> 03:25:39.527]  Hands up, don't shoo!
[03:25:39.527 --> 03:25:47.129]  Which of course, if you remember, started a wave of riots across the country, and the worst race relations in decades.
[03:25:48.163 --> 03:25:53.824]  Because, again, it was based on a complete lie that Michael Brown had his hands up when he was tackled by the officer.
[03:25:53.824 --> 03:25:55.784]  It never happened.
[03:25:55.784 --> 03:25:56.985]  Trump can't win, of course.
[03:25:56.985 --> 03:26:00.225]  We had, you know, Hillary Clinton, 98% certain of winning.
[03:26:00.225 --> 03:26:02.165]  Brett Kavanaugh, serial rapist.
[03:26:02.165 --> 03:26:05.966]  They pushed that monumental hoax for weeks and weeks and weeks.
[03:26:05.966 --> 03:26:16.848]  The KKK kids from KK Covington High School harassing, doxing, exposing, smearing high school kids for standing in one position and smirking.
[03:26:17.995 --> 03:26:28.102]  And the whole Trump colluded with Russia narrative, which of course is why from April 2018 to April 2019, CNN lost 24% of its audience.
[03:26:28.102 --> 03:26:37.108]  Rachel Maddow literally got shaved off hundreds of thousands of viewers in primetime because she relentlessly pushed that complete hoax.
[03:26:37.108 --> 03:26:47.115]  So they're losing their audience, they're losing their income, and now laying off thousands more jobs, which is why, again, they're having to de-platform their competition.
[03:26:48.860 --> 03:26:57.148]  Meanwhile, Democrat Harasser's Trump supporter for wearing MAGA hat claims he was, quote, standing up to a Nazi.
[03:26:57.148 --> 03:27:11.603]  And in fact, there is a MAGA meetup, I believe Jack Posobiec was tweeting about this, at this Hill Country BBQ restaurant in DC, because this idiot TJ Helmstetter walked in there
[03:27:12.424 --> 03:27:18.166]  Saw a man with a MAGA hat, immediately started harassing him, saying, are you from D.C.?
[03:27:18.166 --> 03:27:21.748]  We don't tolerate racism in D.C.
[03:27:21.748 --> 03:27:32.052]  Literally calling him a Nazi, goes on Twitter, calls him a Nazi, the restaurant, because he's harassing one of their patrons straight off the bat, kicks him out and then he whines like he's the victim.
[03:27:32.052 --> 03:27:38.895]  Basically what happened is this Trump supporter who was wearing a MAGA hat, his girlfriend confronted this guy
[03:27:39.614 --> 03:27:44.438]  And he couldn't handle being confronted by his girlfriend, so that made him even more irate.
[03:27:44.438 --> 03:27:52.824]  But then again, the whole point is, he harassed a Trump supporter for wearing a MAGA hat, then got kicked out.
[03:27:52.824 --> 03:27:57.888]  But he thinks he's got the moral high ground because he's standing up to a Nazi.
[03:27:57.888 --> 03:28:01.010]  So every Trump supporter is a Nazi.
[03:28:01.010 --> 03:28:08.716]  I notice now he's started deleting these tweets, by the way, because they're not showing up in the article, because he got absolutely rinsed on Twitter.
[03:28:09.855 --> 03:28:21.782]  He's trying to say that 63 million Americans who voted for Donald Trump are all Nazis because the benchmark for being a Nazi is wearing a MAGA hat.
[03:28:21.782 --> 03:28:24.884]  He's got absolutely rinsed on Twitter.
[03:28:24.884 --> 03:28:32.388]  The restaurant rightly threw him out because he was harassing people and now he's desperately deleting his tweets.
[03:28:33.382 --> 03:28:35.984]  Which is not gonna work because the internet is forever.
[03:28:35.984 --> 03:28:40.467]  So now this restaurant is getting death threats from tolerant progressives.
[03:28:40.467 --> 03:28:44.090]  Like they like to think death threats are eight-year-old AOC impersonators.
[03:28:44.090 --> 03:28:45.111]  They're getting death threats!
[03:28:45.111 --> 03:28:50.395]  There's gonna be a police presence at this MAGA meetup, but it's gonna go ahead anyway.
[03:28:50.395 --> 03:28:52.757]  We'll be back with more InfoWars.com.

[03:29:55.622 --> 03:29:59.723]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:29:59.723 --> 03:30:06.024]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen.
[03:30:06.024 --> 03:30:18.246]  But I wanted to take just a minute out here, from the bottom of my heart, to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[03:30:18.246 --> 03:30:24.627]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is right back
[03:30:24.667 --> 03:30:26.328]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:30:55.037 --> 03:30:56.098]  The time has come.
[03:30:56.098 --> 03:30:57.079]  The time is here.
[03:30:57.079 --> 03:31:09.110]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize the American people, the very existence of our borders, and that the whole world can come here and get everything free, but that we the citizens have to pay for it.
[03:31:09.110 --> 03:31:20.580]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy, if we don't have major innovation and major booms, we will collapse into third world status and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves in Europe
[03:31:20.740 --> 03:31:21.040]  We're good.
[03:31:42.836 --> 03:31:47.379]  InfoWareStore.com 50% off, store-bought free shipping, double Patriot points.
[03:31:47.379 --> 03:31:53.944]  Whatever you do, commit now to history and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things you can do in the fight against the globalists.
[03:31:54.815 --> 03:32:10.710]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena, in the public square, the other thing that's unique about InfoWars is it is the only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy, that's not backed by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[03:32:10.710 --> 03:32:12.432]  It is completely independent of all that.
[03:32:12.432 --> 03:32:19.078]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of the press and freedom of speech.
[03:32:19.278 --> 03:32:20.099]  We're good to go.
[03:32:43.422 --> 03:32:45.604]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:06.992 --> 03:33:13.997]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.997 --> 03:33:18.860]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:18.860 --> 03:33:23.302]  We're back live on the fourth hour of the show.
[03:33:23.302 --> 03:33:30.467]  Headline up at Summit.News, CBC accused of sexualizing children after promoting drag kids documentary.
[03:33:30.467 --> 03:33:31.788]  They're basically out there
[03:33:32.563 --> 03:33:37.246]  Promoting and broadcasting soft porn for pedos.
[03:33:37.246 --> 03:33:38.487]  You know how I know that?
[03:33:38.487 --> 03:33:43.990]  I know that because an actual pedophile and convicted child molester.
[03:33:43.990 --> 03:33:45.591]  This is a big story last week.
[03:33:45.591 --> 03:33:47.873]  Didn't get enough attention.
[03:33:47.873 --> 03:33:50.834]  Actually wrote in a WordPress blog.
[03:33:50.834 --> 03:33:55.357]  He was basically lusting after the 12-year-old drag queen kid.
[03:33:55.357 --> 03:33:56.478]  Desmond is amazing.
[03:33:58.067 --> 03:34:00.588]  And basically saying that he was, quote, hot.
[03:34:00.588 --> 03:34:07.450]  So we know for a fact that actual pedos are lusting after these drag queen kids.
[03:34:07.450 --> 03:34:14.352]  One was arrested and turned out to be an actual sex offender at one of these drag queen story times in Houston.
[03:34:14.352 --> 03:34:16.192]  We covered that story.
[03:34:16.192 --> 03:34:25.835]  Then this convicted child porn peddler, who literally had a cache of 50,000 images of pedo porn,
[03:34:27.040 --> 03:34:32.845]  Wrote a WordPress blog saying how hot he thought a 12-year-old kid was.
[03:34:32.845 --> 03:34:34.527]  It's on wordpress.com.
[03:34:34.527 --> 03:34:38.230]  In fact, I don't know, I didn't even link to it in this article.
[03:34:38.230 --> 03:34:41.814]  I wanted to check if it was still there, if they'd not removed it.
[03:34:41.814 --> 03:34:51.423]  This is WordPress, by the way, which removes entire right-of-center commentary blogs while hosting for months a pedophile lusting over a child.
[03:34:51.423 --> 03:34:52.804]  Oh, he doesn't get deplatformed.
[03:34:53.556 --> 03:34:55.576]  Todd Nickerson doesn't get deplatformed.
[03:34:55.576 --> 03:34:58.477]  Vice.com gives him a platform.
[03:34:58.477 --> 03:35:00.197]  So you've got that going on.
[03:35:00.197 --> 03:35:08.979]  And now CBC, the Canadian broadcaster, has been accused of sexualizing children after it promoted a new documentary about drag kids.
[03:35:08.979 --> 03:35:22.201]  They've got these poor victims, which is what they are, is what I see them as, talking about their alter egos as drag queen kids, while one of them, who is 12 years old, I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,
[03:35:23.226 --> 03:35:24.707]  Take your best guess.
[03:35:24.707 --> 03:35:44.299]  Is dancing around in denim hot pants while actual pedos write WordPress blogs about how they lust after these kids who are being put on national television on an almost daily basis at this point as soft pedo porn for wannabe child molesters.
[03:35:44.299 --> 03:35:48.561]  That's the state of progressivism in 2019.
[03:35:48.561 --> 03:35:52.664]  This was tweeted out by an account called CBC Kids.
[03:35:53.502 --> 03:35:55.923]  So it's not even the main CBC account.
[03:35:55.923 --> 03:36:00.385]  It's specifically a Twitter account aimed at children.
[03:36:00.385 --> 03:36:09.469]  It shows numerous minors talking about their drag alter egos, while one of them, a 12-year-old, performs what some complain were sexually suggested dance moves.
[03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:11.890]  What's it like to be a kid drag queen?
[03:36:11.890 --> 03:36:21.435]  CBC Kids News spoke with four of the stars of CBC's new Drag Kids documentary to find out what drag is and why they do it.
[03:36:21.435 --> 03:36:22.155]  Bear in mind,
[03:36:23.092 --> 03:36:38.876]  This is after the 12-year-old drag queen kid, Desmond is Amazing, who again is another victim, was made by his parents to perform at a gay bar in New York while the patrons in this gay bar literally threw money at him.
[03:36:38.876 --> 03:36:46.318]  And some of those people, some of those gay attendees of that club, were themselves uncomfortable with it.
[03:36:46.318 --> 03:36:47.118]  But then the mother
[03:36:48.760 --> 03:36:49.641]  This is the article.
[03:36:49.641 --> 03:36:58.247]  She went on an Australian TV show, this was a few weeks ago now, and said, I don't understand what the controversy is.
[03:36:58.247 --> 03:37:12.098]  So you've got gay people who show up to this club, who themselves are uncomfortable about why on earth a 12-year-old kid is in a gay club at night, dancing around, while some of the other attendees throw money at him.
[03:37:12.098 --> 03:37:14.840]  And the mother says she doesn't understand what the controversy is.
[03:37:16.172 --> 03:37:21.714]  Meanwhile, they're literally lusting after kids on WordPress blogs, and they're on there for months.
[03:37:21.714 --> 03:37:24.614]  WordPress does nothing whatsoever about it.
[03:37:24.614 --> 03:37:32.556]  After literal sex offenders who were involved in these Drag Queen Storytime events are being arrested.
[03:37:32.556 --> 03:37:36.518]  This is the state of progressivism in 2019.
[03:37:36.518 --> 03:37:38.038]  Absolutely sick.
[03:37:38.038 --> 03:37:39.658]  We had another story the other day.
[03:37:39.658 --> 03:37:45.480]  Photo show kids laying on top of Drag Queen at Drag Queen Storytime event.
[03:37:46.934 --> 03:37:53.857]  This was, you guessed it, Portland, Oregon, the center of all debauchery and degeneracy.
[03:37:53.857 --> 03:37:59.380]  Shows young children lying on top of a drag queen during a Drag Queen Time Story event.
[03:37:59.380 --> 03:38:00.401]  This was at St.
[03:38:00.401 --> 03:38:01.881]  John's Library.
[03:38:01.881 --> 03:38:08.865]  Kids aged five and under, they were literal toddlers at this event, frolicking on top of drag queen Carla Rossi.
[03:38:11.064 --> 03:38:18.629]  When LifeSiteNews drew attention to these photos, the Noma County Library's Flickr account removed them.
[03:38:18.629 --> 03:38:23.172]  So as soon as it began to attract controversy, the photos were removed again.
[03:38:23.172 --> 03:38:25.314]  They know that this is messed up.
[03:38:25.314 --> 03:38:29.297]  As soon as people start complaining about it, they remove the photos.
[03:38:29.297 --> 03:38:31.018]  Absolutely sick.
[03:38:31.018 --> 03:38:36.922]  And now you've got CBC, Canada's premier broadcaster, following in the footsteps
[03:38:37.586 --> 03:38:46.112]  Of all those American networks that platformed this poor victim, Desmond is amazing, doing exactly the same thing.
[03:38:46.112 --> 03:38:49.214]  And the ratio on that tweet was quite something to behold.
[03:38:49.214 --> 03:38:51.295]  In fact, I'm surprised they haven't removed it.
[03:38:51.295 --> 03:38:52.436]  Let's see what it is now.
[03:38:52.436 --> 03:38:55.838]  This again, this is from CBC Kids.
[03:38:55.838 --> 03:38:58.040]  This is a Twitter account aimed at children.
[03:39:00.330 --> 03:39:07.614]  We've got 148 retweets, 1.7 thousand responses, most of them not too supportive.
[03:39:07.614 --> 03:39:09.815]  This is the state of progressivism.
[03:39:09.815 --> 03:39:13.477]  And this is the state of youth culture in 2019.
[03:39:13.477 --> 03:39:19.880]  Ethot sells her own bathwater, breaks up relationships.
[03:39:19.880 --> 03:39:28.164]  This is a 20-year-old cosplay influencer with 4 million Instagram followers, called Belle Delphine, who is, um,
[03:39:28.971 --> 03:39:38.754]  Literally retailing small pots of her own bath water and selling them to desperate incels on the internet.
[03:39:38.754 --> 03:39:41.935]  She sold out after two days!
[03:39:41.935 --> 03:39:43.815]  It's basically against soft porn.
[03:39:43.815 --> 03:39:46.176]  I guess at least she's an adult.
[03:39:46.176 --> 03:39:50.297]  Don't play the video in this clip, by the way, because it basically is soft porn.
[03:39:50.297 --> 03:39:56.659]  Belle Delphine, a self-proclaimed gamer girl, makes money by convincing desperate men to give her beta books via Patreon.
[03:39:56.659 --> 03:39:58.119]  In fact, if you go on her Patreon,
[03:39:58.797 --> 03:40:10.020]  If you give her $2,500 a month on subscription, she says she will quote, she says, I'm not sure what reward I could give you, but we'll talk about it.
[03:40:10.020 --> 03:40:11.701]  Absolutely gross.
[03:40:11.701 --> 03:40:17.683]  I mean, on one level, you can appreciate her relentless entrepreneurship, as I write in the article.
[03:40:17.683 --> 03:40:21.664]  But when it gets to this stage, it's just predatory degeneracy.
[03:40:21.664 --> 03:40:26.105]  And then the tweet at the end of the article talks about how this woman
[03:40:27.421 --> 03:40:30.382]  Received this package that was addressed to her boyfriend.
[03:40:30.382 --> 03:40:34.043]  She opened it or he tried to hide it.
[03:40:34.043 --> 03:40:46.466]  So she made him open it and it was a pot of this bath water that he bought from this e-thot for $30 and basically she dumped him and their relationship is now over.
[03:40:46.466 --> 03:40:48.507]  I'm sure that was worth it.
[03:40:48.507 --> 03:40:56.029]  Another young man explained how his girlfriend broke up with him because he had paid to communicate privately with Belle Delphine via Snapchat.
[03:40:56.974 --> 03:41:14.845]  So these desperate men, even though they've got girlfriends, are paying hard cash to communicate with this 20-year-old British girl who wears a ton of makeup and weird anime cosplay outfits and that's literally costing them their relationships.
[03:41:14.845 --> 03:41:23.971]  I mean, you can't really blame Belle Delphine for exploiting their desperation, but what kind of commentary is that on the state of masculinity in 2019?
[03:41:23.971 --> 03:41:24.332]  Meanwhile,
[03:41:27.521 --> 03:41:34.485]  New trend of tampering with food products and putting them back is going viral!
[03:41:34.485 --> 03:41:36.727]  Three different examples of this in the article.
[03:41:36.727 --> 03:41:43.490]  A new trend where people tamper with food, licking it or half-consuming it before putting it back in the container is going viral.
[03:41:43.490 --> 03:41:50.935]  This happened first, in the first instance, in the city of Lufkin, eastern Texas, in a branch of Walmart where
[03:41:51.698 --> 03:41:56.922]  A woman was filmed opening an ice cream tub, licking it and then placing it back in the freezer.
[03:41:56.922 --> 03:42:03.868]  She now faces up to 20 years in jail for tampering with a consumer product.
[03:42:03.868 --> 03:42:05.529]  So they've actually identified her.
[03:42:05.529 --> 03:42:06.710]  She's going to be charged.
[03:42:06.710 --> 03:42:10.293]  She's going to get at least two years in jail from what I read.
[03:42:10.293 --> 03:42:20.221]  But then there are a spate of other examples, including what appears to be a transgender individual taking a swig of mouthwash before spitting it back in the bottle and walking away.
[03:42:20.854 --> 03:42:28.283]  There's another guy called Shawn Mendes who literally tweeted the police visiting him for doing this.
[03:42:28.283 --> 03:42:31.467]  This is how narcissistic and messed up these kids are.
[03:42:32.327 --> 03:42:46.736]  So they just tweet it like it's nothing, that he could face two years in jail minimum, and he's still on Twitter bragging about it, how he scoops out ice cream with his hand, licks it, stuffs it back in the tub and stuffs it back in the freezer.
[03:42:46.736 --> 03:42:53.440]  And he's still on Twitter bragging about it, even though he's probably going to jail.
[03:42:53.440 --> 03:42:57.322]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:42:57.728 --> 03:43:08.133]  So the InfoWars model is a self-fulfilling, self-supporting structure that is promoting free press and free speech by people getting together and supporting one another and sustaining one another.
[03:43:08.133 --> 03:43:12.956]  It is the only independent press of this size and scale, of this public reach.
[03:43:12.956 --> 03:43:27.443]  It is the one model that says, here's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little-d democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices in supporting InfoWars.
[03:43:27.583 --> 03:43:45.337]  And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[03:43:45.337 --> 03:43:52.043]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[03:43:53.388 --> 03:43:55.970]  I'll be very, very clear with everybody about all of this.
[03:43:55.970 --> 03:43:57.772]  We're going into the season of war.
[03:43:57.772 --> 03:44:03.857]  And they have been inches from shutting down the final mega accounts we have, due to their criminal activity and their digital fraud.
[03:44:03.857 --> 03:44:07.540]  And we need to know that we've got capital to go six months, a year.
[03:44:07.540 --> 03:44:08.441]  We need to end here.
[03:44:08.441 --> 03:44:09.762]  We need to be provisioned.
[03:44:09.762 --> 03:44:10.483]  And you've got mine.
[03:44:10.663 --> 03:44:14.367]  Total commitment that I am going to rampage forward against the enemy fearlessly.
[03:44:14.367 --> 03:44:18.231]  I'm loving every minute of this because I know I'm getting under their skin.
[03:44:18.231 --> 03:44:20.133]  I'm bloodying them up politically.
[03:44:20.133 --> 03:44:25.119]  I'm banging heads with them and they can't help but attack back with lies and that just brings more people here.
[03:44:25.119 --> 03:44:28.442]  So I'm in one hell of a fight and so are you and I need war bonds.
[03:44:28.442 --> 03:44:29.283]  I need gas.
[03:44:29.283 --> 03:44:30.745]  I need ammo politically now.
[03:44:31.185 --> 03:44:37.487]  But literally, if you flood us with money, and if you flood us with product purchases, and if you flood us with your word of mouth, you're unstoppable.
[03:44:37.487 --> 03:44:38.607]  We're unstoppable together.
[03:44:38.607 --> 03:44:40.007]  I want to send a strong message to the enemy.
[03:44:40.007 --> 03:44:47.049]  I want to raise a couple million dollars right now to let the enemy know that their attacks are failing and that you will stand with us, and I will never back down.
[03:44:47.049 --> 03:44:48.029]  You have my commitment.
[03:44:48.029 --> 03:44:52.370]  This only gives me more energy and more understanding of what we're facing and that we were right about this.
[03:44:54.741 --> 03:44:56.121]  There is no longer any doubt.
[03:44:56.121 --> 03:45:02.003]  Multinational companies and governments are funding an attempted violent, Maoist-style overthrow of the U.S.
[03:45:02.003 --> 03:45:04.084]  Our borders are being totally collapsed.
[03:45:04.084 --> 03:45:05.644]  Already-born babies are being killed.
[03:45:05.644 --> 03:45:06.724]  World government is here.
[03:45:06.724 --> 03:45:08.125]  Now is the time for decision.
[03:45:08.125 --> 03:45:11.166]  Now is the time for everyone watching and listening to decide which side they're on.
[03:45:11.166 --> 03:45:21.408]  And if you decide that you want to stop the forces that are banning the American flag and attacking the family and that are attacking our borders and our country and our military and our heritage, if you want to defend that, then now is the time to take action.
[03:45:21.408 --> 03:45:23.429]  And that means word of mouth about this broadcast.
[03:45:23.669 --> 03:45:26.490]  And that means buying products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:26.490 --> 03:45:28.350]  And that means praying for InfoWars.
[03:45:28.350 --> 03:45:29.430]  And praying for President Trump.
[03:45:29.430 --> 03:45:30.350]  And praying for yourself.
[03:45:30.350 --> 03:45:31.411]  And praying for peace.
[03:45:31.411 --> 03:45:32.551]  Praying for justice.
[03:45:32.551 --> 03:45:34.891]  We're running it through July 4th, but it's got to end.
[03:45:34.891 --> 03:45:36.672]  Because we're running out of a lot of the best-selling items.
[03:45:36.672 --> 03:45:38.792]  We have store-wide free shipping.
[03:45:38.792 --> 03:45:40.472]  Store-wide free shipping.
[03:45:40.472 --> 03:45:42.613]  50% off all the supplements and double Patriot Points.

[03:45:43.553 --> 03:45:44.233]  Cancel any time.
[03:45:44.233 --> 03:45:44.773]  It's free.
[03:45:44.773 --> 03:45:46.694]  An additional 10% off on your next order.
[03:45:46.694 --> 03:45:48.294]  You cannot beat these deals.
[03:45:48.294 --> 03:45:52.175]  The best we ever offer at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:45:55.487 --> 03:46:12.155]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements, in that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[03:46:12.155 --> 03:46:19.578]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us, or they'll shut us down, and the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[03:46:19.938 --> 03:46:21.679]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[03:46:21.679 --> 03:46:25.922]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[03:46:25.922 --> 03:46:33.866]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[03:46:33.866 --> 03:46:36.588]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them.
[03:46:36.588 --> 03:46:41.491]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[03:46:41.491 --> 03:46:42.671]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[03:46:42.671 --> 03:46:43.492]  They have side effects.
[03:46:43.652 --> 03:46:48.257]  Not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.

[03:48:52.788 --> 03:48:57.612]  Author, Sweden is experiencing a small-scale war.
[03:48:57.612 --> 03:49:13.524]  This is Swedish author Bjorn Ranelid who warns that the level of crime and violence the previously sedate country, until they brought in millions of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa, is experiencing what amounts to a small-scale war.
[03:49:13.524 --> 03:49:20.389]  Ranelid cites car fires which were previously unknown but have now become commonplace across the country, along with an explosion in shootings.
[03:49:21.087 --> 03:49:30.693]  The author said that blaming the frustrations of young people for the crime wave was a cop-out, since his generation had it just as tough but didn't turn to criminality.
[03:49:30.693 --> 03:49:43.320]  He said they lived crowded in outdated apartments and the economy of many families was poor, but none of my hundreds of acquaintances, friends and playmates burned cars, robbed old people or wore weapons.
[03:49:43.320 --> 03:49:47.263]  And in fact the new trend in Sweden now is children being robbed.
[03:49:48.075 --> 03:49:52.377]  They're telling children not to go out now because they're being robbed.
[03:49:52.377 --> 03:50:02.601]  And there was a big study in Quillette a couple of weeks ago which basically found that it's now a national emergency in many of these migrant ghettos in Sweden.
[03:50:02.601 --> 03:50:08.824]  The rampant crime, the grenade attacks, the shootings, again the sexual violence.
[03:50:08.824 --> 03:50:13.426]  A third of young women in Sweden are now reporting they feel unsafe going out at night.
[03:50:13.426 --> 03:50:15.067]  Those are the ones who admit to it.
[03:50:16.917 --> 03:50:23.640]  And this has all happened under the watch of a feminist government that has opened the borders to mass immigration like never before.
[03:50:23.640 --> 03:50:29.243]  So the sprawling welfare system has failed to deter them from turning to crime.
[03:50:29.243 --> 03:50:36.667]  Now the head of the Swedish security today, Anders Thornberg, has said that Swedes better get used to the current conditions.
[03:50:36.667 --> 03:50:41.609]  He said, quote, this can continue for five to ten years.
[03:50:41.609 --> 03:50:45.231]  Sweden is enjoying its cultural enrichment, just like the UK.
[03:50:46.593 --> 03:50:55.421]  Where we have this headline, Afghan migrant asked people if they were English before attacking them with a 10-inch knife.
[03:50:55.421 --> 03:51:13.037]  So this 32-year-old asylum seeker from Afghanistan basically went into a bunch of supermarkets in South London, selected targeted people specifically by their nationality, he went up to them, asked them where they were from, before attempting to attack them with a 10-inch blade.
[03:51:14.341 --> 03:51:24.008]  His motive was to, quote, kill members of the public if they were English, with the asylum seeker's own cousin warning police, quote, he wants to kill the English people.
[03:51:24.008 --> 03:51:24.768]  I can see his eyes.
[03:51:24.768 --> 03:51:25.449]  He's serious.
[03:51:25.449 --> 03:51:26.570]  He will do it.
[03:51:26.570 --> 03:51:29.692]  He's trying to run and he will kill someone.
[03:51:29.692 --> 03:51:32.834]  So this guy actually attacks three different people.
[03:51:32.834 --> 03:51:38.598]  Only by a miracle did they all escape any kind of serious injury or death.
[03:51:38.598 --> 03:51:43.802]  Meanwhile, in France, Muslim youths attack police station with projectiles, shout Al-Akbar.
[03:51:45.026 --> 03:51:56.989]  A group of 15 Muslim youths attacked a police station in northern France with projectiles, while shouting Allah Akbar, according to a report by Le Figaro, which is a left-wing newspaper in France.
[03:51:56.989 --> 03:51:57.950]  This occurred 2 a.m.
[03:51:57.950 --> 03:52:03.391]  last Friday in the Val-de-Rue-Louvier police station in the department of Yure in France.
[03:52:03.391 --> 03:52:08.453]  The gang of hooded youths threw fireworks and other objects, including paving stones.
[03:52:08.453 --> 03:52:10.213]  This is one of their favorite techniques.
[03:52:10.213 --> 03:52:12.314]  They like to throw fireworks at people.
[03:52:13.542 --> 03:52:20.587]  And the footage always comes out in Sweden, France and other areas where they're throwing fireworks at people.
[03:52:20.587 --> 03:52:27.212]  The left responds to that by saying, why are you afraid of fireworks?
[03:52:27.212 --> 03:52:33.297]  Literally, they're throwing fireworks at people's heads and their response is to say, don't be a snowflake.
[03:52:33.297 --> 03:52:34.738]  You're afraid of fireworks.
[03:52:34.738 --> 03:52:39.942]  These are the same people who are literally afraid of words and ideas with which they disagree.
[03:52:40.666 --> 03:52:50.948]  During the attack, the gang referred to police officers inside the station as French F'ers, while threatening to, while threatening them, come out, we are going to burn you.
[03:52:50.948 --> 03:52:58.370]  So yet another fantastic example of migrant integration going so well in France.
[03:52:58.370 --> 03:53:06.231]  The entire attack lasted around 30 minutes, during which the youths repeatedly shouted, Allah Akbar, which means God is great in Arabic.
[03:53:06.231 --> 03:53:09.672]  They found 115 different projectiles at the scene,
[03:53:10.385 --> 03:53:20.372]  The police union said the attack was unheard of violence and noted that the exact same police station had been targeted last year.
[03:53:20.372 --> 03:53:23.174]  So it's not even the first time that it happened.
[03:53:23.174 --> 03:53:32.920]  Meanwhile, another favourite activity of these newly arrived visitors in Europe is to start riots and fights around swimming pools.
[03:53:32.920 --> 03:53:36.542]  So of course, Europe had a big heat wave last week.
[03:53:36.542 --> 03:53:38.884]  So everyone went out to the public swimming pools.
[03:53:39.941 --> 03:53:44.606]  German swimming pool closed after hundreds of migrants harassed family.
[03:53:44.606 --> 03:53:46.908]  This is in Dusseldorf, Germany.
[03:53:46.908 --> 03:53:54.155]  Swimming pool had to be closed twice after hundreds of male migrants harassed a family, prompting a huge police deployment.
[03:53:54.155 --> 03:54:01.822]  Basically, it started when they started harassing another migrant family, a Turkish man, who was at the pool with his family.
[03:54:02.449 --> 03:54:10.827]  He responded by referring to the migrants as NAFRIs, which is a derogatory term meaning North African Intensive Offenders.
[03:54:12.108 --> 03:54:18.910]  Large numbers of migrants began to harass the man and his family and police were called, only for them to be pelted with empty bottles upon arrival.
[03:54:18.910 --> 03:54:24.471]  So again, when the police show up to try to bring calm to the situation, they attack the police.
[03:54:24.471 --> 03:54:35.754]  We see that in similar circumstances where you have these car fires in these inner city ghettos, where the fire service will come to put out the fire, they'll attack the fire service.
[03:54:38.425 --> 03:54:40.487]  Now they have to be accompanied by the police.
[03:54:40.487 --> 03:54:44.871]  The ambulance crews come out to attend to casualties with some of these riots.
[03:54:44.871 --> 03:54:46.832]  They attack the ambulance crews.
[03:54:46.832 --> 03:54:49.534]  They don't want them there because it's a no-go zone.
[03:54:49.534 --> 03:54:55.179]  But again, according to the media, no-go zones are a conspiracy theory.
[03:54:55.179 --> 03:55:02.606]  The pool had to be closed once again on Sunday due to an incident described as being similar to what happened on Saturday.
[03:55:02.606 --> 03:55:02.966]  So again,
[03:55:03.786 --> 03:55:11.731]  They had a big riot, the police came out, they tried to quell it, they did eventually quell it, and then the exact same thing happened the day later.
[03:55:11.731 --> 03:55:17.354]  Breitbart reports, woman who invited migrants to camp in her garden now demands they leave.
[03:55:17.354 --> 03:55:19.275]  Could never seen this one coming.
[03:55:19.275 --> 03:55:27.260]  A Belgian woman who invited migrants to set up a makeshift camp in her garden now says she wants them to leave after incidents of aggression and violence.
[03:55:28.624 --> 03:55:30.626]  Basically, anyone could see that coming.
[03:55:30.626 --> 03:55:32.787]  She allowed a bunch of them to come and stay.
[03:55:32.787 --> 03:55:34.168]  They invited all their friends.
[03:55:34.168 --> 03:55:35.850]  The neighbours started complaining.
[03:55:35.850 --> 03:55:37.411]  They were fighting with the neighbours.
[03:55:37.411 --> 03:55:38.672]  They were fighting with each other.
[03:55:38.672 --> 03:55:44.517]  At the end of it, a hundred migrants were staying in this woman's back garden, basically.
[03:55:44.517 --> 03:55:46.578]  She later admitted she felt exhausted.
[03:55:46.578 --> 03:55:53.544]  So again, it was another virtue signalling lefty who thought she was doing a great humanitarian good here.
[03:55:53.544 --> 03:55:56.126]  Ended up being a complete disaster.
[03:55:56.126 --> 03:55:57.767]  Now she regrets it.
[03:55:59.606 --> 03:56:04.109]  660,000 migrants waiting to get to Europe from Libya.
[03:56:04.109 --> 03:56:12.955]  While the number of migrants entering Europe has declined, reports claim that as many as 660,000 individuals still remain in Libya looking for a way into Europe.
[03:56:12.955 --> 03:56:14.756]  And of course we know why that is.
[03:56:14.756 --> 03:56:25.023]  Because the criminal people smugglers are working with the left-wing Soros-funded NGOs to literally pick them up from Libya as a taxi service to bring them into Europe.
[03:56:25.655 --> 03:56:45.280]  Matteo Salvini has put in measures to try and stop that, to try and disincentivise that, and of course he's called a fascist for doing so, even though he's literally halved the number of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean, simply by trying to disincentivise it and trying to target the criminal people smugglers.
[03:56:45.280 --> 03:56:46.061]  Europol 2018 stats
[03:56:48.460 --> 03:56:52.363]  24 jihadist attacks, 19 left-wing, only one right-wing.
[03:56:52.363 --> 03:56:56.627]  So they've done a study of terrorism in Europe in 2018.
[03:56:56.627 --> 03:57:04.013]  They found that out of all the attacks, again, 24 were jihadist, 19 left-wing, and only one right-wing.
[03:57:04.013 --> 03:57:10.358]  So this narrative that right-wing terrorism is the biggest threat, again, proven completely inaccurate once again.
[03:57:11.112 --> 03:57:23.375]  And when they drilled into the fatalities involved in terrorist attacks across Europe in 2018, all 13 fatalities were victims of Islamic Jihadist attacks.
[03:57:23.375 --> 03:57:32.078]  So again, the entire narrative that the right wing is the biggest terror threat, at least in Europe, is confounded, is debunked by the statistics.
[03:57:32.910 --> 03:57:37.112]  That's going to wrap it up for the fourth hour with me breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:37.112 --> 03:57:39.594]  Be sure to get the products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:57:39.594 --> 03:57:41.995]  Coming up next is Warren with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:41.995 --> 03:57:42.755]  We'll be back.
[03:57:42.755 --> 03:57:43.656]  Don't go away.
[03:57:43.656 --> 03:57:45.697]  Robert Barnes, what has big tech become?
[03:57:45.697 --> 03:57:54.061]  Big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[03:57:54.201 --> 03:58:06.268]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience that care about this, have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct.
[03:58:06.268 --> 03:58:07.729]  Otherwise, they will never change.
[03:58:07.729 --> 03:58:17.355]  And they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trusts of the 19th century, who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[03:58:17.415 --> 03:58:22.396]  The Infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world.
[03:58:22.396 --> 03:58:25.056]  To make real the actions of independent free speech.
[03:58:25.056 --> 03:58:28.057]  To make real the original promise of an independent free press.
[03:58:28.057 --> 03:58:34.798]  Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[03:58:34.798 --> 03:58:37.679]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[03:58:37.679 --> 03:58:39.479]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[03:58:39.479 --> 03:58:41.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[03:58:41.400 --> 03:58:42.620]  Even it is what you just saw.
[03:58:44.394 --> 03:58:45.715]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[03:58:45.715 --> 03:58:46.495]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[03:58:46.495 --> 03:58:47.076]  Thanks for holding.
[03:58:47.076 --> 03:58:47.616]  Hey, Alex.
[03:58:47.616 --> 03:58:50.418]  Yeah, I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air.
[03:58:50.418 --> 03:58:56.542]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City, and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[03:58:56.542 --> 03:59:05.268]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[03:59:05.268 --> 03:59:06.509]  That's it.
[03:59:06.509 --> 03:59:09.150]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[03:59:09.150 --> 03:59:11.992]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[03:59:11.992 --> 03:59:13.293]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[03:59:13.453 --> 03:59:14.193]  I agree entirely.
[03:59:14.193 --> 03:59:19.656]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[03:59:19.656 --> 03:59:22.438]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[03:59:22.438 --> 03:59:24.499]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[03:59:24.499 --> 03:59:33.743]  But if they do shut you down, know you've gone into this war, you've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue.
[03:59:33.743 --> 03:59:35.664]  We're going to keep fighting in the info war.
[03:59:35.664 --> 03:59:42.147]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[03:59:42.147 --> 03:59:43.068]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[03:59:47.044 --> 03:59:49.654]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
