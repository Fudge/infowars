[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:22.449]  And we're gonna ride We're gonna ride Ride like a one-eyed jack-of-diamonds With the devil close behind We're gonna ride
[00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:43.747]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:00:44.087 --> 00:00:45.828]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:46.768 --> 00:00:48.189]  It's Friday, August 30th, 2019.
[00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:55.732]  We're going to be here for the next four hours, and this is going to be an incredible transmission.
[00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:56.732]  It really is true.
[00:00:57.432 --> 00:01:03.495]  Our republic is at war with Communist China and a consortium of multinational global corporations.
[00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:12.778]  And we have collaborators all across this nation, along with Hollywood and others, openly rooting for China against our own interest and their own interest.
[00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:14.619]  This, my friends, is mind control.
[00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.599]  This, my friends, is brainwashing.
[00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.401]  But there's so many other angles we're going to be hitting on and covering today.
[00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:25.964]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, the People's Liberation Army of China has entered Hong Kong yesterday.
[00:01:26.305 --> 00:01:27.245]  More flooding in.
[00:01:27.565 --> 00:01:29.847]  This is history happening right now.
[00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:30.908]  We're going to be detailing that.
[00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:37.332]  But our own Greg Reese, who just got back a few days ago from Hong Kong, filed this report that is beyond paramount.
[00:01:37.652 --> 00:01:48.800]  So whatever you do, remember, the only way we reach new people, the only way we circumvent the censors, is you spreading the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and sharing InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.741]  Now here is Greg Reese's report.
[00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:56.284]  Gordon Wu proposed the concept for the HKZM Bridge in 1988.
[00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:04.529]  Discussion stalled a year later after the Tiananmen Square Massacre.
[00:02:09.052 --> 00:02:15.836]  The troops have been firing indiscriminately, but still there are thousands of people on the streets who will not look back.
[00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:29.347]  In 1997, the United Kingdom returned control of Hong Kong to China with the agreement that it would remain unchanged until 2047.
[00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:41.057]  That same year, the Chinese central government began showing support for the construction of the Monolithic Bridge.
[00:02:46.777 --> 00:02:55.202]  In 2005, tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong marched for a pro-democracy government and the abolishment of appointed district councils.
[00:02:55.422 --> 00:02:56.663]  In 2008, construction on the HKZM Bridge began.
[00:02:56.683 --> 00:02:58.524]  And less than a year ago, Xi Jinping officially opened the HKZM Bridge.
[00:03:11.247 --> 00:03:17.348]  I hereby declare the Hong Kong-China bridge officially open.
[00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.010]  Allowing a 30-minute entry from mainland China into central Hong Kong.
[00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.271]  The Hong Kong police and the triad gangs have been unable to stall the Hong Kong protests.
[00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:33.312]  There is 100,000 Chinese troops training in Shenzhen, across the northern border.
[00:03:42.314 --> 00:03:52.479]  And now, the People's Liberation Army of China are entering Hong Kong via the 30-minute commute over the HKZM Bridge and Chinese naval vessels.
[00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.861]  China's military has sent a new batch of troops into Hong Kong.
[00:03:57.001 --> 00:03:59.762]  That's according to Beijing's state media Thursday.
[00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:05.265]  State broadcaster CCTV showed troop carriers heading across the border in darkness.
[00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:09.868]  This means a serious escalation from tear gas and rubber bullets.
[00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:17.615]  The Western media seems to be working for the Communist Chinese.
[00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:20.957]  At the very least, they act as advocates.
[00:04:22.158 --> 00:04:30.065]  And with the whole world watching, it will be interesting to see how the mainstream media reports on what could turn out to be Tiananmen Square 2.0.
[00:04:33.464 --> 00:04:40.766]  Things are about to turn ugly in Hong Kong, and how this turns out will certainly have a domino effect on the rest of the world.
[00:04:42.606 --> 00:04:45.067]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:18.534]  If you want to support me so I can keep making videos just like this, visit InfoWarsTore.com where you can get great products like Brain Force, which gives me all the mental clarity I need to make these videos.
[00:05:19.134 --> 00:05:24.318]  Or take Turbo Force, which provides me with enough energy to make it through a long day of interviewing liberals.
[00:05:24.538 --> 00:05:25.098]  What's that mean?
[00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:26.479]  What's that mean?
[00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.220]  Oh, you're mad!
[00:05:30.902 --> 00:05:37.227]  Not only are these products going to enhance your life, but they make sure I can continue bringing you all the content you love.
[00:05:37.427 --> 00:05:39.248]  You called me a traitor?
[00:05:39.288 --> 00:05:42.511]  Yeah, by even making me talk to a trader.
[00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:43.672]  A trader of what?
[00:05:43.692 --> 00:05:44.372]  My country?
[00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:45.333]  Look at me!
[00:05:45.573 --> 00:05:46.054]  Look at me!
[00:05:46.114 --> 00:05:47.375]  What's that say right there?
[00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:49.016]  Don't tread on me!
[00:05:50.677 --> 00:05:52.819]  That's a Russian slogan now.
[00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.760]  That's a Russian slogan.
[00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:56.542]  By nationalist traders.
[00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:15.833]  There's a lot of ugly stuff in the world, but I agree with Matt Drudge when I read one of his tweets last week.
[00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:18.354]  This is one of the prettiest songs ever.
[00:06:18.594 --> 00:06:20.615]  And the album dropped today.
[00:06:20.915 --> 00:06:26.196]  Effing Norman Rockwell, Lena Del Rey's greatest work yet.
[00:06:26.276 --> 00:06:30.297]  I like to light up the stage with a song.
[00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:33.878]  Do shit to keep me turned on.
[00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:41.817]  You know, you see so many really horrible music videos.
[00:06:41.937 --> 00:06:44.078]  Our music video for this...
[00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:06.736]  Title Truck is incredibly good, and then the song is hauntingly magic.
[00:07:07.317 --> 00:07:16.403]  I agree with Matt Drudge, who again, I discovered this through because Matt Drudge hadn't tweeted in a long time, I think it was like a year or so, on his private Twitter.
[00:07:16.864 --> 00:07:19.686]  And so he tweeted about our coverage of the 5G last week.
[00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:22.108]  So I said, I wonder what else he's tweeted.
[00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:23.389]  And I found
[00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:31.403]  That song, F that I love you, and it's just a very, very beautiful song.
[00:07:31.904 --> 00:07:34.404]  We have to remember that we're not being replaced by machines.
[00:07:34.444 --> 00:07:35.845]  They're not going to be superior to us.
[00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:41.527]  The globalists want us to believe we're ugly and stupid and bad and give up and have a post-human world.
[00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:50.630]  But things like this latest album, which I did download this morning and I've been listening to, just lets you know there's a lot of good things on this planet.
[00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.011]  A lot of sunsets.
[00:07:52.911 --> 00:08:06.308]  A lot of coffee, a lot of flowers, a lot of little fishies in the pond swimming around, a lot of great relationships and people and art and culture and literature and music and family and friends.
[00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.992]  That's really what it's all about.
[00:08:09.392 --> 00:08:11.113]  I got up about 5 a.m.
[00:08:11.153 --> 00:08:13.834]  this morning, and I thought, hey, that album drops today.
[00:08:13.874 --> 00:08:17.535]  So I went and listened to it, and each song is just better than the other.
[00:08:17.976 --> 00:08:19.976]  I'm not being paid to say that, by the way.
[00:08:20.196 --> 00:08:23.538]  But beautiful things need to be celebrated, don't they?
[00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:28.760]  You go back to the leftist taking over the CIA completely by the late 50s.
[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.283]  And it's being declassified, the church hearings.
[00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:32.624]  We need more of those declassifications.
[00:08:33.085 --> 00:08:36.128]  How they said, we must teach people to be depressed.
[00:08:36.608 --> 00:08:39.291]  We must make architecture foreboding and ugly.
[00:08:39.812 --> 00:08:42.374]  We must remove green spaces.
[00:08:42.414 --> 00:08:45.618]  We must fund ugly art and disgusting literature.
[00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.731]  As I said earlier this year, they invited me to Sundance Film Festival, and I didn't go.
[00:08:53.751 --> 00:08:56.952]  So I sent a representative, and I've told this story about a hundred times.
[00:08:57.272 --> 00:08:59.073]  Not that I have lack of news to cover.
[00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:00.833]  It's just a huge news day.
[00:09:02.374 --> 00:09:08.596]  And so one of my compadres went, and was there for three, four days, and went to the high-level meetings and breakaway groups.
[00:09:09.176 --> 00:09:14.438]  And they were just talking right in front of him, because this was all done on the DL.
[00:09:14.538 --> 00:09:15.558]  We agreed not to talk about it.
[00:09:16.078 --> 00:09:17.719]  Didn't give the specifics of who was saying it.
[00:09:18.999 --> 00:09:28.144]  We could talk about it all we wanted and they said the mission is to overturn society and to demoralize people and to absolutely destroy culture.
[00:09:28.605 --> 00:09:29.805]  That's where all the money is.
[00:09:30.326 --> 00:09:31.506]  That's what we're being funded to do.
[00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:34.148]  Well, I don't need to go to Sundance to know that.
[00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:49.233]  And so they put out three music videos that I've seen by Del Rey so far, and they're all incredibly nostalgic American flags, back when people were moving to California, back when it was the boom state.
[00:09:50.054 --> 00:09:56.321]  So it's 50s-esque, 60s-esque, and it's like a big old glass of pure
[00:09:57.532 --> 00:10:03.139]  Rainwater with big old juicy ice cubes in it when you've been marching through the middle of the desert.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:14.893]  So whether you're listening to Beethoven's Ninth or tuning in to this young lady, it doesn't matter how boorish she's been in the past.
[00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:16.836]  It's truly, truly beautiful.
[00:10:17.296 --> 00:10:27.485]  Though I do wish that time I got invited by Mr. Perry and the singer from Aerosmith to go cut their new album 10 years ago.
[00:10:27.505 --> 00:10:30.107]  I was invited for a week to be there in San Diego with them.
[00:10:31.687 --> 00:10:33.729]  She talks about Long Beach and San Diego in one of her songs.
[00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:38.332]  She was there then, and I didn't go, because I was too busy fighting the New World Order.
[00:10:38.912 --> 00:10:40.233]  By the way, that's not name-dropping.
[00:10:40.774 --> 00:10:48.319]  But I remember they're like, well, Steven Tyler is dating a woman 30 years junior, and it looks just like his daughter, which she does have that elfin look like his daughter.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.762]  But the point is, is that I had a chance to go.
[00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:56.786]  I like Aerosmith, but I'm just not into running around, following rock stars around.
[00:10:56.806 --> 00:10:59.848]  I got invited to go hang out with Metallica a couple times.
[00:11:01.109 --> 00:11:01.850]  I didn't do it either.
[00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:03.090]  And I'm not name-dropping.
[00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:05.512]  I just don't care about a bunch of dudes.
[00:11:06.253 --> 00:11:07.574]  No matter how cool their music is.
[00:11:08.014 --> 00:11:14.599]  Or no matter the fact that I was, you know, 9 or 10 years old when they only played heavy metal past midnight on the rock station.
[00:11:14.819 --> 00:11:18.261]  And I'd stay up and listen to it in my room with a headset on.
[00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:23.164]  But I would, if I put two and two together, that Lana Del Rey was out there.
[00:11:23.584 --> 00:11:24.265]  I would have gone out there.
[00:11:24.285 --> 00:11:25.065]  So maybe I ought to dig out.
[00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:28.387]  I guess she doesn't date Steven Tyler anymore.
[00:11:28.667 --> 00:11:30.308]  Those are the type of stories I never tell, folks.
[00:11:30.348 --> 00:11:35.391]  Because it's boring if I just say, oh, I didn't blow off, you know, Perry or Tyler.
[00:11:35.751 --> 00:11:40.294]  It's just that what matters to me is being here on the air talking to you.
[00:11:40.994 --> 00:11:48.459]  And then here's this horrible news about 5G killing us and the globalists hiding from it that Drudge linked to, but something beautiful right next to it.
[00:11:49.212 --> 00:11:52.173]  And that's why Drudge has got the master stroke and is really a smart guy.
[00:11:52.193 --> 00:11:53.954]  And I just admire him from afar.
[00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:58.656]  You know, they say, never meet your idols because you'll be disappointed.
[00:11:58.696 --> 00:12:02.778]  But I never meet your heroes, but I was certainly not disappointed.
[00:12:03.218 --> 00:12:06.859]  And years later, he's proven to be absolutely dead on target about what was unfolding.
[00:12:06.879 --> 00:12:07.800]  So thanks, Matt.
[00:12:08.863 --> 00:12:15.106]  I spend so much time with my head in the news, like I know you do, that I don't ever really have time to see what the new music is, or even go see the new movie.
[00:12:15.766 --> 00:12:21.489]  Because quite frankly, I'm so tunnel-visioned on this that I only spend time with my wife and children in the off time.
[00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:30.212]  And I usually go hunting or shooting or fishing, just to totally disconnect, and do some forest bathing, or walking through the desert bathing, nature bathing.
[00:12:30.773 --> 00:12:33.774]  But I'm really glad that I found that last week.
[00:12:33.834 --> 00:12:38.176]  So here is to Lena, Del Rey, and Matt Drudge, and all of us that share beautiful things together.
[00:12:39.847 --> 00:12:55.000]  Now, speaking of that, we'll get into all the ugly stuff, because if we're gonna save the beautiful world and protect all the good things, us men are gonna have to roll up our old sleeves, like Ben Grimm and the Fantastic Four, and say, it's clobberin' time!
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:13:00.885]  And that's what this really, really comes down to, because all this news is incredibly epic.
[00:13:01.185 --> 00:13:04.929]  But if I just say it in my voice, maybe it doesn't really catch people like it should.
[00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:06.330]  But how about in this voice?
[00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:08.372]  Autobots.
[00:13:08.912 --> 00:13:12.034]  Boris Johnson has put the Queen in an absurdly awkward position.
[00:13:12.575 --> 00:13:15.137]  That's the propaganda from the Decepticons at CNN.
[00:13:15.517 --> 00:13:21.822]  The truth is, she's honoring the referendum of the people of the UK, more than three years ago, to leave the dictatorial EU.
[00:13:23.134 --> 00:13:26.277]  Or perhaps I should cover some of these other articles in that voice.
[00:13:26.917 --> 00:13:30.920]  Transgender runner to compete against women in NCAA division.
[00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:32.642]  That's the Washington Post.
[00:13:32.982 --> 00:13:38.626]  But maybe we should translate that to, runner who lost as a man for three years will now compete against girls.
[00:13:39.827 --> 00:13:41.349]  That's an Infowars.com translation.
[00:13:41.969 --> 00:13:43.510]  Here's a Gateway Planet translation.
[00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:51.737]  After losing on men's team for three years, biological male runner will now compete against women in NCAA race as transgender.
[00:13:52.722 --> 00:13:54.183]  Thinking about, should I start?
[00:13:54.523 --> 00:14:01.947]  Host English show is, who's the guy, I always forget his name, even though I'm a big fan.
[00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:03.568]  Even though I'm a big fan.
[00:14:03.648 --> 00:14:04.969]  No, no, I know the name's Optimus Prime.
[00:14:05.689 --> 00:14:13.694]  What's the name of the British actor who was actually in the OSS and an assassin in World War II, just out a few years ago.
[00:14:14.494 --> 00:14:17.536]  And he played Count Dooku in Star Wars.
[00:14:17.976 --> 00:14:19.237]  He did all the big Dracula movies.
[00:14:19.797 --> 00:14:20.778]  It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.721]  Because I can talk like him, too.
[00:14:24.181 --> 00:14:30.005]  Maybe I should host the show in... All you gotta do is search who plays Count Dooku, and you'll have it.
[00:14:30.966 --> 00:14:32.307]  I just, I hate it when my memory fails.
[00:14:32.347 --> 00:14:36.029]  And then, of course, everybody else is listening, saying they know exactly who I'm talking about.
[00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.330]  I'll search it.
[00:14:39.672 --> 00:14:41.473]  Christopher Lee, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:41.493 --> 00:14:41.873]  That's right.
[00:14:43.454 --> 00:14:44.735]  I can talk like Christopher Lee.
[00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:49.799]  Would folks rather me do the whole show in a Christopher Lee voice?
[00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:00.572]  Let's get serious here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:01.452 --> 00:15:03.793]  We've got a big transmission lined up for you.
[00:15:03.813 --> 00:15:04.513]  We're going to break.
[00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:15.276]  When we come back, I'm not going to get caught starry-eyed off in Lena Del Rey land in nostalgia and Norman Rockwell worship, which I think we all should engage in.
[00:15:15.756 --> 00:15:20.198]  It is the medicine to counter the globalist moralization and the poison.
[00:15:21.418 --> 00:15:23.479]  You know of what I speak and of.
[00:15:27.264 --> 00:15:30.709]  So we're going to be going over all of it when we return.
[00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:33.212]  So start your engines.
[00:15:34.854 --> 00:15:35.716]  Start your engines.
[00:15:36.877 --> 00:15:39.100]  Because we've had enough time resting.
[00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:49.929]  In the still high place of the Lord, we will now descend back to Earth to engage the globalists that take the planet and our people to the next level.
[00:15:50.789 --> 00:15:53.790]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is The Info War.
[00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.551]  The only way we get outside this cage is you.
[00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.792]  But you've done it, and we're winning.
[00:16:09.551 --> 00:16:12.895]  We have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[00:16:13.635 --> 00:16:20.643]  We have to level them, because if there are survivors, if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.
[00:16:20.783 --> 00:16:29.772]  Jennifer Rubin, a senior writer at the Washington Post, said that if conservatives and Trump supporters can weather the storm of lawsuits, harassment,
[00:16:30.453 --> 00:16:31.013]  Death threats.
[00:16:31.093 --> 00:16:33.494]  We need to just physically burn them down.
[00:16:33.694 --> 00:16:35.595]  She says there must be no survivors.
[00:16:35.835 --> 00:16:37.215]  What do you think Infowars is?
[00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:38.595]  What do you think we're going through?
[00:16:38.676 --> 00:16:39.516]  You're the target, though.
[00:16:39.636 --> 00:16:42.237]  But I've dared to challenge their Queen Hillary.
[00:16:42.617 --> 00:16:44.677]  I dared to mobilize the population.
[00:16:45.057 --> 00:16:46.638]  You dared to mobilize the population.
[00:16:46.758 --> 00:16:47.478]  And we're here.
[00:16:47.598 --> 00:16:50.279]  And we have energized the core of the nation.
[00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:51.479]  Black, white, old, young.
[00:16:51.599 --> 00:16:53.560]  And people don't buy the propaganda anymore.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:57.702]  I have so many people walk up to me and they say, you know, I didn't even used to be a fan of yours until I heard them lie about you.
[00:16:57.742 --> 00:17:00.884]  And I had to go hear what you were saying to find out why they were after you.
[00:17:00.944 --> 00:17:02.846]  And man, you've got an amazing broadcast.
[00:17:04.386 --> 00:17:06.288]  I'm shaking more hands than I've ever shook.
[00:17:07.708 --> 00:17:09.870]  I'm getting more support on the ground.
[00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:15.043]  Not financial, because it's only a core audience that actually buys the products.
[00:17:15.063 --> 00:17:22.870]  We're doing something very special, and I can tell you, this special is the very best special we've ever done, particularly with this type of sale.
[00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.832]  It's a type of sale we've never engaged in.
[00:17:24.932 --> 00:17:32.599]  But DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10, and everything else you need for your telomeres, your cells, energy, it's the base you need for everything.
[00:17:32.619 --> 00:17:34.781]  If you don't have this, no amount of energy drink's gonna help you.
[00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:36.082]  It's the fount of it all.
[00:17:36.222 --> 00:17:40.426]  It's the very best, you name it, nootropic, antioxidant for your cells.
[00:17:40.566 --> 00:17:41.066]  It's just in you.
[00:17:41.086 --> 00:17:43.408]  And this has got a bunch of patented stuff you can make claims on.
[00:17:43.528 --> 00:17:45.009]  It's unbelievable.
[00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.710]  98% reviews.
[00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:46.511]  Memphoreshore.com.
[00:17:46.531 --> 00:17:47.211]  Let me go further.
[00:17:47.371 --> 00:17:49.713]  Super Mill Vitality is our second bestseller.
[00:17:49.893 --> 00:17:52.716]  I don't need to sit there and tell you how great it is.
[00:17:52.816 --> 00:17:59.221]  Cold-pressed herbs, wild harvested, so that they keep their psychoactive, I mean, it's the brain, everything.
[00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:00.462]  Libido, energy, stamina.
[00:18:00.622 --> 00:18:02.504]  Carnivore, digestive enzymes.
[00:18:03.877 --> 00:18:08.759]  This is a product that's been popular, people that know what they're doing, but overall not a popular product.
[00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:11.600]  I'm not going to get into what these expensive enzymes do.
[00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.981]  They don't just help you break down fat or break down protein in the gut.
[00:18:15.101 --> 00:18:16.341]  It does it in the intestines.
[00:18:16.481 --> 00:18:21.443]  If you want to flush out the meat you've been eating and you want to really get healthy, this is amazing.
[00:18:21.523 --> 00:18:22.243]  It's next level.
[00:18:22.363 --> 00:18:23.404]  And so guess what I'm doing?
[00:18:23.604 --> 00:18:26.285]  We are going to give it to you free.
[00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:29.326]  This is the biggest sale of these two items I've ever done.
[00:18:29.346 --> 00:18:32.627]  You get a free bottle of Carnivore with DNA Force, the 90 count one.
[00:18:32.967 --> 00:18:36.148]  And with Super Mel Vitality, you get a free bottle of the 30-count Carnivore.
[00:18:36.308 --> 00:18:38.069]  Carnivore, literally, is incredible.
[00:18:38.169 --> 00:18:43.830]  So get those today at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:49.092]  We're giving it to you free at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:18:49.252 --> 00:18:55.714]  Take advantage of those two specials on Super Mel Vitality and DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsLive.com.
[00:18:55.974 --> 00:18:56.934]  Without you, we won't be here.
[00:18:56.994 --> 00:18:58.255]  With you, we will prevail.
[00:19:03.331 --> 00:19:04.772]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[00:19:05.032 --> 00:19:06.814]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[00:19:07.154 --> 00:19:08.515]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[00:19:08.915 --> 00:19:09.816]  But I'll be honest with you.
[00:19:10.657 --> 00:19:15.080]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[00:19:16.001 --> 00:19:17.662]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[00:19:17.862 --> 00:19:18.463]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[00:19:19.163 --> 00:19:19.904]  But here's the bottom line.
[00:19:20.925 --> 00:19:22.166]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[00:19:22.386 --> 00:19:24.807]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[00:19:25.087 --> 00:19:25.867]  I don't want them to win.
[00:19:26.247 --> 00:19:28.268]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.930]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.051]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[00:19:35.431 --> 00:19:39.173]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[00:19:39.233 --> 00:19:40.473]  These will change your life.
[00:19:40.813 --> 00:19:42.194]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:43.914]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[00:19:44.215 --> 00:19:44.875]  Check it all out.
[00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:46.496]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[00:19:46.856 --> 00:19:48.456]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[00:19:48.656 --> 00:19:49.837]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[00:19:50.137 --> 00:19:51.278]  You get great products at the same time.
[00:19:51.598 --> 00:19:53.740]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:56.001]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[00:19:56.241 --> 00:19:59.384]  Take action now and fund the InfoWar for your own future.
[00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:09.491]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:17.694]  The Grey rides to Isengard, seeking my counsel.
[00:20:18.715 --> 00:20:21.256]  For that is why you have come, is it not?
[00:20:22.837 --> 00:20:23.637]  My old friend.
[00:20:24.498 --> 00:20:25.238]  Saruman.
[00:20:30.741 --> 00:20:31.982]  You are sure of this?
[00:20:32.502 --> 00:20:33.302]  Beyond any doubt.
[00:20:34.703 --> 00:20:36.444]  So the Ring of Power has been found.
[00:20:38.417 --> 00:20:39.458]  Yes, it was in the shire.
[00:20:40.419 --> 00:20:41.340]  Under my very nose.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.782]  And yet you did not have the wit to see it.
[00:20:44.342 --> 00:20:48.746]  Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
[00:20:49.607 --> 00:20:50.608]  But we still have time.
[00:20:51.088 --> 00:20:53.690]  Time enough to counter Sire Romney if we act quickly.
[00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.131]  Time?
[00:20:56.252 --> 00:20:58.034]  What time do you think we have?
[00:20:59.404 --> 00:21:02.365]  Sauron has regained much of his former strength.
[00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:09.006]  He cannot yet take physical form, but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
[00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:14.628]  Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
[00:21:14.668 --> 00:21:18.969]  His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh.
[00:21:19.409 --> 00:21:20.649]  You know of what I speak.
[00:21:22.293 --> 00:21:24.694]  You know of what I speak, Gandalf.
[00:21:25.274 --> 00:21:26.314]  An eye.
[00:21:26.414 --> 00:21:27.714]  A great eye.
[00:21:28.294 --> 00:21:31.095]  Lidless, wreathed in flame.
[00:21:31.115 --> 00:21:33.856]  May I have some?
[00:21:34.496 --> 00:21:36.676]  He is gathering all evil to him.
[00:21:37.256 --> 00:21:41.737]  Very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle-earth.
[00:21:42.618 --> 00:21:43.398]  You know this?
[00:21:43.518 --> 00:21:46.058]  How?
[00:21:47.739 --> 00:21:48.539]  I have seen it.
[00:21:49.645 --> 00:21:52.327]  A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
[00:21:53.548 --> 00:21:54.028]  Why?
[00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:57.531]  Why should we fear to use it?
[00:21:57.591 --> 00:22:04.236]  They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing stones.
[00:22:04.957 --> 00:22:07.659]  We do not know who else may be watching.
[00:22:10.821 --> 00:22:12.823]  The hour is later than you think.
[00:22:13.463 --> 00:22:15.725]  Sauron's forces are already moving.
[00:22:18.257 --> 00:22:21.419]  The Nine have left Minas Morgon.
[00:22:21.479 --> 00:22:22.320]  The Nine?
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.141]  They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve.
[00:22:25.882 --> 00:22:28.323]  Disguised as riders in black.
[00:22:28.804 --> 00:22:29.844]  They've reached the Shire.
[00:22:30.124 --> 00:22:32.286]  They will find the ring.
[00:22:34.407 --> 00:22:36.428]  And kill the one who carries it.
[00:22:36.488 --> 00:22:37.209]  Frodo.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.261]  He did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron.
[00:22:56.281 --> 00:22:58.061]  There are none who can.
[00:22:59.702 --> 00:23:08.404]  Against the power of Mordor, there can be no victory.
[00:23:09.224 --> 00:23:12.124]  We must join with him, Gandalf.
[00:23:13.565 --> 00:23:15.165]  We must join with Sauron.
[00:23:21.786 --> 00:23:29.544]  Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?
[00:24:09.693 --> 00:24:18.097]  I gave you the chance, Alfie, aiding me, willingly, but you have elected the way of
[00:24:44.148 --> 00:24:49.692]  I don't know how all this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[00:24:50.633 --> 00:24:54.235]  It's a fight between the biggest mass murderers in history, the communist chi-coms.
[00:24:54.956 --> 00:25:01.881]  Now attempting to absorb another group of people to feed on, and rob, and torture, and make submit to their evil.
[00:25:03.487 --> 00:25:06.692]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and history is repeating in a big way.
[00:25:07.153 --> 00:25:13.903]  Let me tell you, because I opened the broadcast up a little bit unorthodox today, but let me tell you what we're going to be covering here and who's coming on the transmission.
[00:25:15.331 --> 00:25:32.419]  Lord Monckton will be joining us, who's right at the heart of the founding of UKIP, and now the Brexit Party, and Nigel Farage, and Boris Johnson, and the Queen, for the first time in 400 years, suspending Parliament because they're violating the referendum of the people to pull out of the unelected EU.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.341]  That will be in the fourth hour, then.
[00:25:36.081 --> 00:25:48.445]  Before that happens, we're going to be talking to Carpe Donctum about some amazing new operations he's been launching in the fight to restore the Republic to the people and out of the hands of the globalists allied with the CHICOMS.
[00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:51.446]  I also intend to open the phones up as well.
[00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:56.853]  And then, before we get to that, I'm first going to get into, too late!
[00:25:57.493 --> 00:26:01.795]  Trump tells MSNBC, Weasel O'Donnell, lawyer up, despite apology.
[00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:09.817]  They tried to float it out there, hoping Trump would know that, oh, Trump got caught working with the Russians, he gets money with Putin.
[00:26:10.237 --> 00:26:13.938]  Totally pulled out of Lawrence O'Donnell's butt.
[00:26:15.419 --> 00:26:18.660]  And now, he literally cried during his retraction.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:19.480]  He cried.
[00:26:20.612 --> 00:26:22.534]  And now the smell of blood is in the air.
[00:26:23.334 --> 00:26:41.311]  And this is exactly what Trump needs to do is go on the offense against these criminals that have defamed this country, the election, those that voted for Trump, myself, everyone who's been put to the ringer by all of this as MSNBC's creature begins to backpedal.
[00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:42.832]  It's all up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:44.306 --> 00:26:46.348]  Also, we're going to get into report.
[00:26:46.428 --> 00:26:48.410]  Two cameras outside Jeffrey Epstein's cell.
[00:26:48.851 --> 00:26:49.712]  Malfunctioned.
[00:26:49.752 --> 00:26:50.693]  How convenient.
[00:26:51.213 --> 00:26:52.495]  The world's waking up to Comey.
[00:26:53.175 --> 00:26:55.638]  Getting away with basically murder politically.
[00:26:55.998 --> 00:26:57.400]  And that ties into a bunch of other angles.
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.101]  And I don't like to make ourselves the news.
[00:26:59.642 --> 00:27:00.983]  And I didn't think of this stunt.
[00:27:01.684 --> 00:27:02.565]  Owen Schroyer did.
[00:27:02.605 --> 00:27:04.327]  It's a big national story yesterday and today.
[00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:08.601]  The head of YouTube said, oh, we want everyone to be able to upload.
[00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:09.842]  We don't censor anybody.
[00:27:10.283 --> 00:27:12.565]  Even controversial material come back to the platform.
[00:27:13.165 --> 00:27:17.429]  So Owen put up an InfoWars feed on there, and it was banned in two hours.
[00:27:18.009 --> 00:27:20.231]  And the media celebrated a fake triumph.
[00:27:20.492 --> 00:27:27.137]  Oh, look, we shut you down again while simultaneously saying they don't censor anybody.
[00:27:27.618 --> 00:27:28.739]  What's sad is David Knight.
[00:27:30.236 --> 00:27:31.037]  He's doing his own show.
[00:27:31.117 --> 00:27:31.897]  It was on YouTube.
[00:27:32.118 --> 00:27:35.361]  Me reaching millions of people every few weeks just on that.
[00:27:35.841 --> 00:27:36.482]  That got banned.
[00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:45.429]  It really hurt David's feelings that they, you know, he's being shipped off to the digital gulag, you know, for even being associated with Trump and Infowars.
[00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.031]  But that's the way this works.
[00:27:47.131 --> 00:27:49.193]  And I don't think Owen thought that his stunt would do that.
[00:27:49.213 --> 00:27:50.314]  I mean, it's a good stunt.
[00:27:51.601 --> 00:27:52.221]  She's a liar.
[00:27:52.441 --> 00:27:53.522]  She's saying this for Congress.
[00:27:53.962 --> 00:27:54.823]  These people are frauds.
[00:27:55.163 --> 00:27:57.424]  She's been in interviews saying she wants to censor me.
[00:27:58.125 --> 00:27:59.125]  We're going to play some of that.
[00:27:59.185 --> 00:28:00.126]  So that's coming up.
[00:28:01.547 --> 00:28:05.370]  And then we've got the rise of robots now being stores like Walmart.
[00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.431]  They're already rolling out.
[00:28:06.891 --> 00:28:09.553]  Biden fumbling and bumbling all over the place.
[00:28:10.634 --> 00:28:12.455]  More on animal human clones.
[00:28:13.156 --> 00:28:18.480]  Biggest outbreak of Ebola ever in the Congo and a massive surge of people from the Congo into Texas.
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.521]  New developments on that front.
[00:28:21.342 --> 00:28:27.387]  There is so much to get to here today and we're going to cover it all with a news blitz
[00:28:29.096 --> 00:28:38.610]  On the other side of this break, so whatever you do, start your engines and remember, whether you're listening on AM and FM stations, or watching on local TV, or on the internet, the globalists miscalculated.
[00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:39.972]  They thought we'd be shut down by now.
[00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:45.391]  But because of you standing with us, and because of your word of mouth that overrides the A.I.
[00:28:45.451 --> 00:28:50.893]  and smashes their attempt to crush your voice, we are cutting through the fog.
[00:28:51.013 --> 00:28:51.914]  But it's nip and tuck.
[00:28:52.554 --> 00:28:53.975]  It's touch and go.
[00:28:53.995 --> 00:28:58.277]  So your prayers, your financial support, and your word of mouth is paramount!
[00:28:58.617 --> 00:29:00.738]  So this is your mission if you choose to accept it.
[00:29:04.594 --> 00:29:05.755]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[00:29:05.795 --> 00:29:09.079]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news.
[00:29:09.179 --> 00:29:10.260]  But it's very exciting.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.642]  It's super silver skin cream.
[00:29:12.742 --> 00:29:14.204]  It's got all of these benefits.
[00:29:14.244 --> 00:29:15.285]  Too many to mention.
[00:29:15.345 --> 00:29:16.446]  But it's revolutionary.
[00:29:16.606 --> 00:29:17.447]  It's brand new.
[00:29:17.547 --> 00:29:18.328]  People are going to love it.
[00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:20.470]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream.
[00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.011]  Exclusively at

[00:29:32.197 --> 00:29:37.120]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.

[00:29:52.128 --> 00:29:53.050]  We have big tubes of it.
[00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.131]  This stuff is the real deal.

[00:30:05.202 --> 00:30:09.364]  Here's Alex Jones putting the tinfoil hat on display.
[00:30:09.484 --> 00:30:21.430]  As you can see, the tinfoil hat, which was once a one-piece tinfoil hat meant to sit on your head comfortably, has now evolved into not just a tinfoil hat, but an adjustable antenna.
[00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.871]  So not only do you have the tinfoil hat,
[00:30:23.991 --> 00:30:35.595]  To protect yourself against fake news and predict the future, now it's included a tinfoil hat antenna, adjustable antenna, so you can pick up the InfoWars streams wherever you are on planet Earth.
[00:30:35.775 --> 00:30:40.396]  It's the brand new InfoWars tinfoil hat with adjustable antenna.
[00:30:40.456 --> 00:30:48.719]  We're working on getting the satellite feeds up and ready so that you can tune in to the InfoWars live broadcast with your tinfoil hat passion.
[00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:49.339]  Vogue.
[00:30:49.619 --> 00:30:49.939]  Power.
[00:30:50.299 --> 00:30:51.019]  Alex Jones.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.120]  Tinfoil Hat.
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.421]  Now, Alex is a man of many talents, but you didn't know he had that type of catwalk ability.
[00:30:57.441 --> 00:30:58.601]  Just look at the attitude.
[00:30:58.921 --> 00:31:01.242]  Look at the flippant nature of defiance.
[00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:02.502]  Look at the rebellion.
[00:31:02.822 --> 00:31:04.322]  Ugh, just total defiance.
[00:31:04.542 --> 00:31:09.604]  It's the brand new InfoWars Tinfoil and Tinfoil Hat with adjustable antenna.
[00:31:09.684 --> 00:31:15.625]  You can pick up HD audio of the Alex Jones Show with your brand new InfoWars Tinfoil Hat.
[00:31:15.725 --> 00:31:17.646]  We told you first about the fluoride in the water.
[00:31:17.746 --> 00:31:19.587]  We told you first about Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:31:19.727 --> 00:31:21.548]  Now you can hear it for yourself!
[00:31:21.768 --> 00:31:26.331]  Live time with the InfoWars tinfoil hat!
[00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:28.292]  How's the satellite feed coming in, Alex?
[00:31:28.452 --> 00:31:29.153]  Crystal clear.
[00:31:29.233 --> 00:31:29.953]  Crystal clear.
[00:31:30.173 --> 00:31:31.114]  HD feed, baby.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.462]  So right now I'm on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:31:35.922 --> 00:31:43.850]  If I adjust the antenna approximately 30 degrees to the east... Now I've got the David Knight Show!
[00:31:44.931 --> 00:31:46.893]  Now I'm listening to David Knight this morning.
[00:31:46.933 --> 00:31:50.397]  He's talking about leftist cities and how they promote abortion.
[00:31:50.417 --> 00:31:55.482]  Hold on, let me just tune it now 60 degrees to the southwest and give it a little bend here.
[00:31:56.122 --> 00:31:57.684]  And now I'm tuned into the War Room!
[00:32:04.804 --> 00:32:08.491]  Well today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[00:32:10.534 --> 00:32:14.021]  I just devoured your cousin, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[00:32:35.547 --> 00:32:59.850]  What the hell's going on here?
[00:33:06.397 --> 00:33:09.139]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:20.265]  I used to shoot up my vans in the yard.
[00:33:21.506 --> 00:33:23.887]  It's even brighter, you're gone.
[00:33:24.868 --> 00:33:27.329]  So many things I would say.
[00:33:44.853 --> 00:33:45.474]  Welcome back!
[00:33:46.835 --> 00:33:48.497]  Dream a little dream with me, my friends.
[00:33:48.517 --> 00:33:51.659]  To build a better world and touch the stars.
[00:33:51.739 --> 00:33:53.541]  We've already done it.
[00:33:54.082 --> 00:33:55.142]  We're gonna do it again.
[00:33:55.162 --> 00:33:56.604]  We're unstoppable.
[00:33:58.345 --> 00:33:58.726]  Okay.
[00:34:01.457 --> 00:34:02.137]  Where to begin?
[00:34:02.157 --> 00:34:22.510]  I think I'm going to start here in the news coverage with an individual who is more arrogant and more fake than almost anybody I can think of in the news.
[00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:24.071]  I mean, Brian Stelter
[00:34:25.427 --> 00:34:31.830]  He's like a little kid dressed up like a superhero or dressed up like a soldier acting tough.
[00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:34.352]  I mean, it's just unwatchable.
[00:34:34.992 --> 00:34:36.092]  It's so inauthentic.
[00:34:36.553 --> 00:34:37.293]  It's so fake.
[00:34:37.493 --> 00:34:38.253]  There's nothing there.
[00:34:38.974 --> 00:34:40.695]  Everyone knows you're looking at a fraud.
[00:34:41.975 --> 00:34:47.098]  With O'Donnell, he has what you could call masculine features.
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.201]  But he just
[00:34:56.098 --> 00:35:03.740]  I mean, Brian Stelter poses for photographs and looks like a psychotic child molester.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:11.463]  I mean, if I was going to cast the Penguin and make a Batman movie about the Penguin, if you cast him as the Penguin,
[00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:19.893]  And if the Penguin was a child molester and like kidnapped kids and harvested their organs or something, it would be an Academy Award winning film.
[00:35:20.174 --> 00:35:20.934]  And I'm not being mean.
[00:35:20.954 --> 00:35:26.716]  If you're a TV viewer, you were seeing the average photo of Stelter when he's on the red carpet feeling powerful.
[00:35:26.936 --> 00:35:28.336]  Like, let's put his demon face back up.
[00:35:28.396 --> 00:35:31.317]  That's whatever space junk attached to him.
[00:35:32.638 --> 00:35:36.039]  That's, that's, that's, that's, that's who you don't want to be.
[00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:39.980]  So Brian Stelter is the fakest, weakest person in media.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.121]  But Lawrence O'Donnell,
[00:35:45.306 --> 00:35:48.749]  is the most arrogant.
[00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:58.157]  And when you tune in to him, he just comes off as completely phony and just like a stuffed shirt.
[00:35:58.337 --> 00:36:03.982]  He just believes that he's going to tell you these whopper lies.
[00:36:05.225 --> 00:36:17.434]  And because he's wearing a $3,000 suit and an $800 tie, because his teeth are all capped, and because he sits there and tries to put on a face of believability, it's still completely transparent.
[00:36:19.235 --> 00:36:24.199]  Again, like a rubber banana, you know, a plastic fruit.
[00:36:24.219 --> 00:36:26.241]  I mean, you know it's fake from 20 feet away.
[00:36:28.983 --> 00:36:33.326]  And he came out and recycled the old propaganda that Deutsche Bank
[00:36:34.616 --> 00:36:37.477]  That's made loans for Trump Towers around the world.
[00:36:37.757 --> 00:36:38.938]  One of the companies Trump's used.
[00:36:39.618 --> 00:36:40.478]  He's always paid them back.
[00:36:40.498 --> 00:36:43.619]  You know, they've gotten their return since the 90s.
[00:36:47.401 --> 00:36:50.582]  And they said, oh, oligarchs gave that money to Trump.
[00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.183]  And of course, he said Deutsche Bank was a source.
[00:36:53.223 --> 00:36:55.243]  And Deutsche Bank said, no, there's no source.
[00:36:55.303 --> 00:36:55.823]  It's not true.
[00:36:56.784 --> 00:36:59.105]  And O'Donnell had to backtrack on it.
[00:36:59.125 --> 00:36:59.585]  But here's the thing.
[00:37:01.081 --> 00:37:02.161]  He didn't get the memo.
[00:37:02.561 --> 00:37:05.522]  The New York Times put out memos to its people, so did MSNBC.
[00:37:05.542 --> 00:37:07.703]  They said, no one believes Russia anymore.
[00:37:07.923 --> 00:37:08.683]  These things have leaked.
[00:37:08.763 --> 00:37:09.244]  We've covered them.
[00:37:10.224 --> 00:37:13.805]  And so you need to stop saying that Trump's a Russian agent.
[00:37:14.185 --> 00:37:21.968]  People see Trump working his butt off, trying to stand up to China, trying to get jobs back here, trying to rebuild our infrastructure.
[00:37:23.168 --> 00:37:24.969]  He's basically flogging CEOs.
[00:37:25.489 --> 00:37:29.370]  He's going after GM that we bailed out for hundreds of billions of dollars and moving to China.
[00:37:30.725 --> 00:37:31.365]  It's disgusting.
[00:37:32.406 --> 00:37:34.447]  He can declare a national emergency and order them back.
[00:37:34.847 --> 00:37:36.188]  Which, by the way, he's begun to do.
[00:37:36.208 --> 00:37:41.711]  And by the way, this is a national emergency.
[00:37:43.552 --> 00:37:46.273]  But now Lawrence O'Donnell has been forced to apologize.
[00:37:48.114 --> 00:37:49.135]  And that's blood in the water.
[00:37:49.195 --> 00:37:50.576]  And so Trump says, too late.
[00:37:50.696 --> 00:37:54.318]  Stories up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com by Steve Watson.
[00:37:54.338 --> 00:37:57.820]  Trump tells MSNBC weasel O'Donnell to lawyer up despite apology.
[00:37:58.814 --> 00:37:59.815]  Because it's not enough.
[00:38:00.195 --> 00:38:02.356]  They've been doing this for three-plus years.
[00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:04.438]  Before Trump even got elected, he's a Russian agent.
[00:38:04.738 --> 00:38:08.500]  I've watched congressional hearings, and I'm not a victim, I'm a target, like Tommy Robinson says.
[00:38:09.001 --> 00:38:26.432]  But I mean, there's been at least 15 hearings we've played here, where they have leaders, high-level Democrats in the Senate and House, in armed services committees, intelligence committees, and they go, well, we've got a lot of Russian operatives and agents like Alex Jones that echoes Putin's propaganda and works for them.
[00:38:27.773 --> 00:38:30.475]  And then I get around the New York Times people, and they follow me around Austin.
[00:38:31.336 --> 00:38:35.600]  I'll be at a court hearing or something for my kids, and they're like, we know you got money from Putin.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.441]  And I'm like, really?
[00:38:37.762 --> 00:38:39.884]  All I get is a few sponsors and my listeners buying products.
[00:38:40.144 --> 00:38:41.585]  I'd like to see a copy of that check.
[00:38:42.906 --> 00:38:46.229]  And the woman starts laughing at me, going, we know it's coming out.
[00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.851]  And she believed it, folks.
[00:38:48.752 --> 00:38:50.153]  She believed it.
[00:38:51.277 --> 00:38:57.320]  And so the average person believed Hillary's still gonna get in, Trump's gonna be removed, fight against this outside force.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.781]  They believed this!
[00:39:01.542 --> 00:39:02.423]  Russians, scum!
[00:39:02.443 --> 00:39:03.643]  We're at war with Russia, remember?
[00:39:03.663 --> 00:39:08.866]  All the different Democrats on MSNBC, Keith Olbermann saying that?
[00:39:10.627 --> 00:39:11.327]  And none of it was true.
[00:39:11.347 --> 00:39:16.490]  Yeah, there are companies in Russia you can go hire to run any type of ad you want and they'll send spam to the US.
[00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.070]  80% of the funding.
[00:39:20.776 --> 00:39:27.101]  So it's about saying that you didn't elect Trump, you didn't make America great again, you are a foreign agent when the Democrats, we all know, are the ones.
[00:39:49.616 --> 00:39:52.238]  That tell us America was never great, it'll never be that great.
[00:39:52.558 --> 00:39:53.139]  We suck.
[00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:54.500]  Saying the nation's good is bad.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:56.961]  Saying nationalism is bad and racist.
[00:39:57.462 --> 00:39:58.602]  We're being demoralized.
[00:39:58.622 --> 00:39:59.823]  The CHICOM's fund this.
[00:40:00.884 --> 00:40:01.445]  It's admitted.
[00:40:02.966 --> 00:40:07.729]  And you've got to come to grips with the fact that all the people suckered by this can't admit they got conned.
[00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:16.135]  I've given you the analogy or the parable or the parallel, really, it's a parallel, of I have family.
[00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:18.437]  Some distant family and some close family.
[00:40:19.804 --> 00:40:19.944]  I think?
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:50.203]  I've had business associates that got conned by the Nigerians, will never talk to me again, and said that I, warning them, messed up them getting the money.
[00:40:50.223 --> 00:41:00.407]  So you gotta understand, Democrats and others have been so conned, they can't admit, like a Nigerian scam, email scam, or other scams, that this has happened.
[00:41:04.288 --> 00:41:08.230]  Folks, I can't tell you the rest of the story.
[00:41:10.114 --> 00:41:16.195]  But I had to throw a Nigerian out of a family member's house years ago and almost got in a fistfight.
[00:41:16.215 --> 00:41:18.516]  Okay?
[00:41:19.836 --> 00:41:20.376]  That's how bad it is.
[00:41:21.377 --> 00:41:24.677]  Now, that's what this whole Democrat thing is, is the same.
[00:41:24.777 --> 00:41:25.718]  These people have been conned.
[00:41:26.198 --> 00:41:33.640]  It's like somebody gambling and they've mortgaged the house, they've been up for three days in Vegas, and they just go, I've got to go get more money, I'm going to sell my car because I'm going to win it all back.
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:35.320]  No, you're not going to win it all back!
[00:41:36.755 --> 00:41:41.157]  You've been conned, and liberals are desperate, grasping, cowardly little people.
[00:41:41.317 --> 00:41:42.057]  I'm gonna tell you this story.
[00:41:42.498 --> 00:41:43.078]  I'll play O'Donnell.
[00:41:46.299 --> 00:41:53.662]  Every time I see a car stopping in a turn lane that has a whole lane, it's always some leftist with leftist stickers.
[00:41:53.943 --> 00:41:56.003]  They're literally idiots, folks.
[00:41:56.964 --> 00:41:58.765]  Here's O'Donnell crying, and we'll come back.
[00:41:58.805 --> 00:41:59.125]  Here he is.
[00:41:59.906 --> 00:42:03.748]  Last night on this show, I discussed information that wasn't ready for reporting.
[00:42:03.808 --> 00:42:09.790]  I repeated statements a single source told me about the President's finances and loan documents with Deutsche Bank.
[00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:15.692]  Saying, if true, as I discussed the information, was simply not good enough.
[00:42:15.873 --> 00:42:23.576]  I did not go through the rigorous verification and standards process here at MSNBC before repeating what I heard from my source.
[00:42:24.096 --> 00:42:28.878]  Had it gone through that process, I would not have been permitted to report it.
[00:42:29.478 --> 00:42:29.618]  Uh-huh.
[00:42:57.643 --> 00:42:59.725]  What a punk, what a scammer, what a liar.
[00:43:00.005 --> 00:43:01.467]  It's you that hates America, O'Donnells.
[00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:07.192]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[00:43:07.212 --> 00:43:08.153]  I've hung out with that guy.
[00:43:08.173 --> 00:43:09.834]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[00:43:09.955 --> 00:43:11.716]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[00:43:11.796 --> 00:43:13.618]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein s***.
[00:43:13.938 --> 00:43:15.480]  That is a f***ing fact.
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.082]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:43:18.282 --> 00:43:21.165]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[00:43:21.385 --> 00:43:24.268]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[00:43:24.588 --> 00:43:27.611]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist.
[00:43:27.691 --> 00:43:30.674]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:43:30.854 --> 00:43:35.919]  Alex Jones supported President Trump but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[00:43:36.079 --> 00:43:41.043]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[00:43:41.224 --> 00:43:43.346]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just...
[00:43:43.846 --> 00:43:44.066]  Yeah.
[00:43:44.226 --> 00:43:46.388]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:48.630]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:43:48.711 --> 00:43:50.472]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:43:50.712 --> 00:43:54.516]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:43:54.596 --> 00:43:56.738]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:43:56.818 --> 00:43:59.761]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:44:00.061 --> 00:44:03.945]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[00:44:04.767 --> 00:44:11.513]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[00:44:11.733 --> 00:44:12.914]  The government's poisoning the water?
[00:44:13.335 --> 00:44:13.935]  Absolutely.
[00:44:13.955 --> 00:44:22.903]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make them more easily manageable.
[00:44:23.303 --> 00:44:25.704]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one!
[00:44:25.924 --> 00:44:27.825]  He's fighting back against my takeover!
[00:44:28.185 --> 00:44:30.106]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[00:44:30.287 --> 00:44:33.348]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[00:44:33.508 --> 00:44:36.269]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:41.132]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[00:44:41.332 --> 00:44:43.253]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:45.114]  Jones says there's a world government.
[00:44:45.194 --> 00:44:47.115]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[00:44:47.355 --> 00:44:47.635]  It is.
[00:44:47.655 --> 00:44:48.555]  On and on and on.
[00:44:49.116 --> 00:44:51.697]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[00:44:51.957 --> 00:44:57.801]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[00:44:58.962 --> 00:45:04.305]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Farooli, developed brain cancer.
[00:45:04.405 --> 00:45:07.687]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[00:45:08.147 --> 00:45:19.675]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[00:45:19.935 --> 00:45:35.463]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves.
[00:45:35.743 --> 00:45:39.866]  Cell phones operate as microwave transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[00:45:40.006 --> 00:45:41.066]  Now what's a microwave do?
[00:45:41.106 --> 00:45:43.147]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[00:45:43.347 --> 00:45:46.169]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave.
[00:45:46.189 --> 00:45:50.151]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[00:45:50.171 --> 00:45:57.916]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls.
[00:46:15.347 --> 00:46:21.729]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:24.830]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[00:46:41.954 --> 00:46:43.916]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[00:46:43.936 --> 00:46:45.137]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[00:46:45.337 --> 00:46:47.739]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:48.880]  Years ago.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:56.566]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[00:46:56.646 --> 00:46:58.808]  He was talking about this years ago.
[00:46:58.828 --> 00:47:00.610]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:47:06.314 --> 00:47:08.957]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:18.212 --> 00:47:19.733]  I am a shotgun rider.
[00:47:23.994 --> 00:47:28.376]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line.
[00:47:28.556 --> 00:47:32.658]  The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry.
[00:47:33.238 --> 00:47:40.981]  I was riding on the cold coast and everything was fine, till we took a shorter road to save some time.
[00:47:41.001 --> 00:47:42.781]  Bandits only fired once.
[00:47:42.861 --> 00:47:44.742]  Bandits only fired once.
[00:47:44.882 --> 00:47:46.623]  They shot me in the chest.
[00:47:48.335 --> 00:47:57.240]  You know, that's the thing about a fight.
[00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:58.741]  I expect to get attacked.
[00:47:58.821 --> 00:47:59.982]  I expect to get threatened.
[00:48:00.282 --> 00:48:02.063]  I expect to get sued.
[00:48:02.383 --> 00:48:03.984]  In the fight to restore the Republic.
[00:48:04.985 --> 00:48:08.467]  And I just get stronger through it all because of you backing us.
[00:48:09.487 --> 00:48:10.668]  And I love the contest.
[00:48:19.104 --> 00:48:25.068]  There's nothing better than the exhilaration and the ecstasy of carrying out your destiny.
[00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:34.233]  But I could swim, and I'll ride again.
[00:48:35.154 --> 00:48:38.756]  Alright, enough of me singing the Highwomen.
[00:48:39.836 --> 00:48:40.837]  Here's Highwomen!
[00:48:41.697 --> 00:48:44.659]  Our title track on Highwomen 2, the Highwomen!
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.601]  Echoes throughout time.
[00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:51.491]  Okay, let me finish up.
[00:48:51.551 --> 00:48:52.551]  Talk about looking down a black hole.
[00:48:52.571 --> 00:48:54.112]  Can we put Brian Stelter back on screen, please?
[00:48:55.872 --> 00:49:08.197]  Not just what he does when he sits up there on TV and acts all officious and powerful and imperious, but when he walks catwalks, you can find hundreds of these photos, he makes the most demonic, satanic,
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:09.780]  Face.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.421]  I mean, he wasn't beaten with an ugly stick.
[00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.601]  He was beaten with a demon face.
[00:49:14.122 --> 00:49:20.024]  So, for those of you that have never been in a satanic ritual, Satanist like I have, and I got out of it.
[00:49:20.044 --> 00:49:20.644]  I was never in it.
[00:49:20.704 --> 00:49:23.685]  I got lured into it twice and left the meetings.
[00:49:24.205 --> 00:49:25.926]  But I'm talking about with rich people, powerful people.
[00:49:26.146 --> 00:49:27.446]  They all got faces on like that.
[00:49:28.647 --> 00:49:29.787]  Let's put him back on screen.
[00:49:29.807 --> 00:49:30.527]  So, let me explain something.
[00:49:30.907 --> 00:49:34.108]  It's the Joker is one of the looks, okay?
[00:49:34.209 --> 00:49:34.889]  A demon possession.
[00:49:35.429 --> 00:49:36.289]  And let me tell you right now.
[00:49:36.669 --> 00:49:38.290]  That's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:39.397 --> 00:49:40.097]  You want to see it?
[00:49:40.837 --> 00:49:45.058]  That right there is the face of a really, really bad person.
[00:49:45.598 --> 00:49:53.519]  Now, you can also judge the tree by its fruits, of course, and the fruits are pure lies, propaganda, censorship, just absolute evil.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.540]  I'm not saying he looks like a serial killer, Tyler Molester.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.140]  I'm not saying he is.
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:49:59.480]  I'm saying he looks like one.
[00:50:00.161 --> 00:50:01.101]  It's my right to say.
[00:50:02.201 --> 00:50:04.701]  We've still got a First Amendment, you little piece of crap.
[00:50:06.062 --> 00:50:08.142]  But we know he's been molesting and raping the First Amendment.
[00:50:10.169 --> 00:50:11.449]  Well, I mean, what have I said?
[00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:11.850]  I have a source.
[00:50:34.312 --> 00:50:45.780]  That Lawrence O'Donnell goes to the local park on weekends, and goes around in bathrooms hoping nobody flushed the toilet, and then he gets a big wooden spoon out and eats human feces.
[00:50:47.101 --> 00:50:55.707]  I mean, unless I have the proof of that, I shouldn't say, I've got a source that Lawrence O'Donnell, you know, goes around like a you-know-what house rat eating human feces.
[00:50:55.907 --> 00:50:57.468]  That's a gross thing, and it's not true.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.501]  But see, there is no Russian connection.
[00:51:02.281 --> 00:51:03.201]  That's all with Hillary.
[00:51:03.281 --> 00:51:03.921]  We all know that.
[00:51:04.182 --> 00:51:11.244]  But she hasn't gotten the memo that Barr isn't going to prosecute Comey and all the other criminals, even though there's a bunch of grand juries that are open.
[00:51:12.644 --> 00:51:14.025]  The Justice Department is declining.
[00:51:14.045 --> 00:51:16.045]  They're still going after some of the others.
[00:51:16.566 --> 00:51:19.647]  Because they're supposed to stop trying to overthrow the elected president.
[00:51:19.847 --> 00:51:20.767]  But they're not going to stop!
[00:51:23.251 --> 00:51:42.317]  And the times I get to talk to Trump, and he wants to tell me, oh good job, pat me on the head, I go, sir, I don't need to be told, you appreciate me, we're in this together, you need to prosecute these people, they're never going to stop, don't believe a word what your advisors tell you, they can't stand what you're doing, they've never been defeated yet, completely, they're not going to stop until you decisively crush them.
[00:51:42.817 --> 00:51:45.058]  Make it about China, and the sellout to China.
[00:51:45.478 --> 00:51:47.399]  Make it about globalism.
[00:51:47.439 --> 00:51:50.160]  And again, that's because that's what it is.
[00:51:51.479 --> 00:51:53.420]  And I'm not the only person telling Trump this.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:59.883]  But that's why they're so desperate to shut us down, because they know we're getting that information out.
[00:52:01.224 --> 00:52:02.304]  So, I'm gonna tell you again.
[00:52:03.425 --> 00:52:07.347]  It's like saying, oh, Trump met Epstein a few times at public parties over the years.
[00:52:07.367 --> 00:52:08.788]  There's a few photos and videos of him.
[00:52:09.508 --> 00:52:19.313]  Bill Clinton's on the plane dozens and dozens of times, Hillary, all these billionaires, all these globalists, you know, David Rockefeller, Bill and Melinda Gates at the meetings with him.
[00:52:20.879 --> 00:52:22.539]  But oh, Epstein, Trump's friend!
[00:52:22.559 --> 00:52:24.060]  And it's the same thing.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.080]  Hillary's up to her eyeballs in Russian stuff.
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.160]  Uranium One, all of it.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.441]  She's soliciting them to sell us out.
[00:52:30.461 --> 00:52:31.201]  They're like, okay.
[00:52:33.141 --> 00:52:34.442]  And they're projected back on Trump.
[00:52:34.462 --> 00:52:35.762]  You're like, wait a minute, what is this, an echo?
[00:52:35.842 --> 00:52:36.682]  We're done with Russia.
[00:52:36.942 --> 00:52:37.242]  I know.
[00:52:38.122 --> 00:52:47.204]  But again, this is Lawrence O'Donnell creeping back up to beta test it to see if he can climb into the toilet one more time and have a meal.
[00:52:48.177 --> 00:52:48.538]  I don't know.
[00:53:04.855 --> 00:53:11.381]  Joe Rogan's show attacking one of the Democratic candidates and Joe kept asking her and she couldn't back up and goes, what's a toady?
[00:53:11.401 --> 00:53:12.722]  She goes, I don't know what toady means.
[00:53:13.163 --> 00:53:16.286]  She's a New York Times senior writer, doesn't know what a toady is.
[00:53:16.506 --> 00:53:17.887]  A toady's you, lady!
[00:53:18.347 --> 00:53:22.251]  A toady's Lawrence O'Donnell to the power structure and the chi-com media.
[00:53:22.611 --> 00:53:28.137]  A maverick, a trailblazer, a leader is Donald Trump.
[00:53:28.993 --> 00:53:30.975]  This broadcast is a leader.
[00:53:31.375 --> 00:53:32.456]  Is a trailblazer.
[00:53:32.756 --> 00:53:34.077]  Is a maverick.
[00:53:34.537 --> 00:53:35.138]  Organic.
[00:53:35.518 --> 00:53:36.299]  Grassroots.
[00:53:36.799 --> 00:53:37.339]  Dominant.
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:38.861]  Defeats you from nowhere.
[00:53:39.741 --> 00:53:41.162]  That's Americana, bitch!
[00:53:42.263 --> 00:53:43.464]  Move, O'Donnell!
[00:53:43.544 --> 00:53:44.485]  Get out the way!
[00:53:44.805 --> 00:53:45.786]  Move, O'Donnell!
[00:53:45.846 --> 00:53:46.727]  Get out the way!
[00:53:46.967 --> 00:53:47.747]  Get out the way!
[00:53:47.927 --> 00:53:48.828]  You see them headlights?
[00:53:49.088 --> 00:53:50.529]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:52.471]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[00:53:52.511 --> 00:53:53.151]  Tell me that!
[00:53:53.892 --> 00:53:54.853]  Get out of my way!
[00:53:56.291 --> 00:53:58.973]  Like the one-eyed jack of diamonds with the devil close behind.
[00:53:59.294 --> 00:54:01.435]  You get behind us, parasite.
[00:54:01.716 --> 00:54:10.603]  You're always following us when we found cities, when we found companies, when we found planets, when we found, we build.
[00:54:11.444 --> 00:54:13.005]  You don't... Yeah, what was that idiot's name?
[00:54:14.366 --> 00:54:15.807]  I meant to play this months ago.
[00:54:15.828 --> 00:54:17.409]  What's her name?
[00:54:19.791 --> 00:54:20.612]  Barry Weiss.
[00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:26.614]  And I mean, it is the most fantastical idiocy you've ever seen.
[00:54:27.594 --> 00:54:29.575]  Jimmy Dore does the best job dismantling her.
[00:54:29.815 --> 00:54:30.215]  You know what?
[00:54:30.355 --> 00:54:31.276]  I'm gonna play that today.
[00:54:31.296 --> 00:54:33.176]  I never played that a few weeks ago and I wanted to play it again.
[00:54:33.196 --> 00:54:35.937]  Let's find that edited down clip so it's not 30 minutes of Dore.
[00:54:36.277 --> 00:54:38.998]  It's like five minutes of it and it's just the stuff she says.
[00:54:40.899 --> 00:54:45.521]  I mean, literally, my 11-year-old daughter is politically more
[00:54:46.488 --> 00:54:47.269]  In form than her.
[00:54:47.529 --> 00:54:47.989]  You understand?
[00:54:48.029 --> 00:54:49.150]  I'm not saying that with pleasure.
[00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:51.811]  It's an echo chamber of toadies!
[00:54:53.132 --> 00:54:55.373]  Minions, followers, sycophants!
[00:54:56.834 --> 00:54:57.675]  That's you!
[00:54:58.715 --> 00:55:05.960]  Living in the rotting edifices of the collapsing dinosaur media, funded by drug lord kingpins and money launderers!
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.501]  I mean, that's who you are!
[00:55:09.315 --> 00:55:13.777]  If there's a pole star of leadership, you're the place in the universe the furthest away from it.
[00:55:13.938 --> 00:55:14.898]  And I'm not being mean!
[00:55:15.278 --> 00:55:26.745]  That's why you always declare yourselves the intellectuals, and declare yourselves the mavericks, and declare yourselves the great leaders, when you're nothing but a dropping!
[00:55:27.425 --> 00:55:28.746]  So get out the way!
[00:55:28.946 --> 00:55:29.866]  Move, bitch!
[00:55:30.146 --> 00:55:31.207]  Get out the way!
[00:55:31.507 --> 00:55:32.548]  Move out the way, bitch!
[00:55:32.588 --> 00:55:33.548]  Get out the way!
[00:55:34.329 --> 00:55:34.569]  Sorry.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:36.821]  Quoting Ludacris here.
[00:55:36.841 --> 00:55:40.803]  Got a lot of the stuff I want to get to, but they've been given over to a great delusion.
[00:55:41.183 --> 00:55:42.164]  A strong delusion.
[00:55:42.184 --> 00:55:42.864]  What's the Bible verse?
[00:55:43.324 --> 00:55:44.685]  Strong delusion.
[00:55:44.965 --> 00:55:45.366]  Type it in.
[00:55:45.406 --> 00:55:45.866]  Bible verse.
[00:55:45.886 --> 00:55:46.566]  Strong delusion.
[00:55:47.047 --> 00:55:48.207]  They have a strong delusion.
[00:55:48.547 --> 00:55:50.889]  And here's Lawrence O'Donnell thinking we're under his strong delusion.
[00:55:51.169 --> 00:55:51.409]  No, no.
[00:55:51.489 --> 00:55:55.431]  You're under a strong delusion in your own little echo chamber, sonny boy.
[00:55:55.451 --> 00:55:57.653]  So let's play his non-apology again.
[00:55:57.713 --> 00:55:58.093]  One more time.
[00:55:59.076 --> 00:56:03.017]  Last night on this show, I discussed information that wasn't ready for reporting.
[00:56:03.077 --> 00:56:09.078]  I repeated statements a single source told me about the President's finances and loan documents with Deutsche Bank.
[00:56:09.798 --> 00:56:14.979]  Saying, if true, as I discussed the information, was simply not good enough.
[00:56:15.159 --> 00:56:22.840]  I did not go through the rigorous verification and standards process here at MSNBC before repeating what I heard from my source.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:28.161]  Had it gone through that process, I would not have been permitted to report it.
[00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:32.244]  I should not have said it on air or posted it on Twitter.
[00:56:32.604 --> 00:56:33.665]  I was wrong to do so.
[00:56:33.705 --> 00:56:38.388]  This afternoon, attorneys for the president sent us a letter asserting the story is false.
[00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:40.970]  They also demanded a retraction.
[00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:43.272]  Tonight, we are retracting the story.
[00:56:43.892 --> 00:56:55.021]  We don't know whether the information is inaccurate, but the fact is we do know it wasn't ready for broadcast, and for that, I apologize.
[00:56:55.621 --> 00:56:57.222]  And we don't know if he's a robot.
[00:56:57.282 --> 00:56:59.283]  We don't know if he's from Pluto.
[00:56:59.323 --> 00:57:00.784]  We don't know if he's plastic.
[00:57:01.205 --> 00:57:02.485]  We don't, but we do know he's a liar.
[00:57:03.126 --> 00:57:03.686]  Lawrence O'Donnell.
[00:57:03.746 --> 00:57:05.367]  Okay, I didn't plug this this hour.
[00:57:05.507 --> 00:57:08.089]  I should have, but I'll get to that in a moment.
[00:57:08.429 --> 00:57:15.854]  Second Corinthians 2 11, and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they shall believe a lie.
[00:57:16.094 --> 00:57:19.816]  Yeah, God, Thessalonians, God turns them over to that.
[00:57:20.297 --> 00:57:22.078]  Now, what will I comment
[00:57:25.134 --> 00:57:25.594]  Ban.Video!

[00:57:52.790 --> 00:57:53.671]  Ban.Video!
[00:58:04.787 --> 00:58:08.757]  Okay, hold on, there's more.
[00:58:09.238 --> 00:58:13.168]  Hold on, hold on, there's more.
[00:58:16.511 --> 00:58:16.851]  Wow.
[00:58:17.572 --> 00:58:26.740]  Well look, apparently Beto needs four different non-stick pans to cook his miniature burgers or whatever that was he put on an English muffin with two pieces of broccoli.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.162]  I've never seen anything quite like it, but it is kind of weird.
[00:58:29.182 --> 00:58:32.865]  It's like an alien trying to convince you that they're human, everything that Beto's been up to.
[00:58:33.005 --> 00:58:41.433]  But you know, I think that the problem that Beto is having now is he's eating all these burgers and it's causing indigestion and flatulation.
[00:58:41.673 --> 00:58:44.636]  And so I'm just here to offer Beto a solution.
[00:58:44.756 --> 00:58:52.482]  Apparently he's been flatulating more than the average cow that's causing global warming because he hasn't been taking his carnivore from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:52.502 --> 00:58:56.886]  So you may not know this, but when you eat red meat, sometimes it doesn't always digest properly.
[00:58:56.906 --> 00:58:58.247]  This can lead to indigestion.
[00:58:58.267 --> 00:59:00.269]  This can lead to flatulation.
[00:59:00.289 --> 00:59:02.971]  This can lead to other issues with digestion.
[00:59:03.191 --> 00:59:05.193]  And so we offer the probiotic carnivore.
[00:59:05.293 --> 00:59:08.375]  And I'm not even kidding you, I mean, I eat cheeseburgers a lot, probably too much.
[00:59:08.495 --> 00:59:10.617]  In fact, I'm trying to consciously cut back.
[00:59:10.857 --> 00:59:20.444]  But when I do, I do take the carnivore before I do with the digestive enzymes in there to help you properly digest red meat and high-protein foods.
[00:59:20.484 --> 00:59:22.465]  But Beto, he didn't get the memo.
[00:59:22.705 --> 00:59:29.570]  And so he's walking around campaigning after he eats a cheeseburger on an English muffin with a piece of broccoli, and he's flatulating more than a cow.
[00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:31.251]  But you gotta give it to Beto.
[00:59:31.471 --> 00:59:34.992]  He's courageous to eat that much red meat and walk around farting all day.
[00:59:35.192 --> 00:59:42.795]  But we're telling him, Carnivore from Infowarsstore.com, it's got the probiotics, it's got the enzymes to help you digest those burgers, Beto.
[00:59:42.835 --> 00:59:50.979]  So whether Beto wants to put his burger on an English muffin or whatever he wants to do, he better take his Carnivore before he does it.
[00:59:54.798 --> 00:59:58.902]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:59.402 --> 01:00:00.724]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:00:27.882 --> 01:00:31.644]  Did you feel the power level going up on the planet?
[01:00:31.664 --> 01:00:33.265]  The crossroads are here.
[01:00:34.186 --> 01:00:36.167]  The event horizon has been crossed.
[01:00:36.187 --> 01:00:39.088]  The point of no return is upon us.
[01:00:39.128 --> 01:00:53.377]  You know, everybody always asks how I'm so fired up.
[01:00:53.637 --> 01:00:55.058]  I say, what drugs are you on, Jones?
[01:00:55.958 --> 01:00:57.279]  We're all sure I'm on drugs.
[01:00:58.666 --> 01:00:59.507]  You know what I am on?
[01:01:00.507 --> 01:01:02.589]  I'm on two cups of coffee right now.
[01:01:03.390 --> 01:01:04.551]  But I'm on freedom.
[01:01:04.871 --> 01:01:06.152]  And I am on fire.
[01:01:06.172 --> 01:01:09.314]  In the next segment, I'm going to get into why I'm on fire.
[01:01:09.334 --> 01:01:11.436]  Because what's happening in the UK is unbelievable.
[01:01:11.836 --> 01:01:13.417]  What's happening in China is incredible.
[01:01:13.938 --> 01:01:16.020]  What's happening with the robot takeovers all here.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.641]  I've just got too much news.
[01:01:18.361 --> 01:01:20.123]  And I'm going to hit it all coming up.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:24.362]  Because this is just an amazing time to be alive.
[01:01:24.382 --> 01:01:31.968]  And I want to get into Comey being above the law and tied into some other articles that deal with that and some incredible Epstein information as well.
[01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:38.233]  And then we have Carpe Dongtum and Lord Christopher Monckton joining us, coming up as well.
[01:01:38.754 --> 01:01:46.180]  And I do intend in that third hour to open your phones up on what you think the biggest issue is, the biggest development in the world right now.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:49.483]  Is it the China invading Hong Kong and that heating up to a boil?
[01:01:50.851 --> 01:01:53.474]  Is it India invading Kashmir and almost no coverage of that?
[01:01:53.534 --> 01:01:55.135]  That's a proxy war with the U.S.
[01:01:55.195 --> 01:01:55.596]  and China.
[01:01:55.916 --> 01:01:58.118]  Is the private Federal Reserve trying to plunge the economy?
[01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:05.685]  Is it the whole Russia gate collapsing and then now the deep state moving into trying to start a race war?
[01:02:06.726 --> 01:02:07.967]  Is it Brexit?
[01:02:08.388 --> 01:02:15.715]  Three plus years after they pass it, almost four years, the Queen comes in, suspends Parliament, first time in 400 years, because the Parliament's ignoring the referendum of the people.
[01:02:16.475 --> 01:02:24.182]  I mean, there is just so many big, fat, juicy things that are happening right now.
[01:02:24.202 --> 01:02:29.206]  And then in the middle of it, the EU's on the verge of collapse.
[01:02:29.787 --> 01:02:32.069]  There's Islamic globalist invasion being funded.
[01:02:32.089 --> 01:02:33.831]  They're trying to collapse our borders.
[01:02:34.431 --> 01:02:36.353]  Ilhan Omar's pushing for the UN to take over.
[01:02:36.913 --> 01:02:40.576]  I mean, this is the age of everything coming out, basically.
[01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:42.999]  And so,
[01:02:44.793 --> 01:02:51.537]  I'm going to do my best just to run through one story after another when we come back on the other side of this break.
[01:02:52.237 --> 01:02:58.821]  And then there's just so many new videos of Joe Biden stammering and stuttering that we can't even play them all.
[01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:00.222]  And it's getting worse.
[01:03:01.155 --> 01:03:05.457]  They clearly got him amped up on a bunch of coffee or something to try to make it better.
[01:03:05.497 --> 01:03:06.098]  It's not working.
[01:03:06.498 --> 01:03:11.601]  He does this... He's telling fake stories.
[01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:12.221]  It never happened.
[01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.022]  Let's get his fake war story queued up.
[01:03:15.062 --> 01:03:16.083]  I don't know if I saw that on the list.
[01:03:16.103 --> 01:03:18.124]  It's probably here, but... I mean, hey!
[01:03:18.144 --> 01:03:19.625]  You gotta have a CNN job or a...
[01:03:20.305 --> 01:03:21.085]  MSNBC job.
[01:03:21.105 --> 01:03:23.907]  I mean, Brian Williams said he got shot down in a helicopter by RPG.
[01:03:24.407 --> 01:03:26.968]  Turned out he was never in a helicopter, never near RPG fire.
[01:03:27.368 --> 01:03:31.150]  Hillary said basically the same stuff happened to her in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
[01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:34.052]  That the Serbs were shooting at her.
[01:03:34.172 --> 01:03:34.832]  None of it was true.
[01:03:35.492 --> 01:03:37.153]  There's photos and videos of her getting off the plane.
[01:03:37.173 --> 01:03:37.713]  Everything's fine.
[01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:41.055]  I mean, it's pathetic, folks.
[01:03:41.075 --> 01:03:44.837]  You know, I myself was shot down in a helicopter by RPG in a dream I had.
[01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:48.344]  See, that's not even a story that happened that you'd want to tell.
[01:03:48.844 --> 01:03:51.125]  Folks, I know they've been shot down in helicopters by RPGs.
[01:03:51.165 --> 01:03:55.786]  We'll never tell you the story about being shot down in helicopters by RPG.
[01:03:57.367 --> 01:04:01.368]  That's kind of a little secret about it, but it just never ends.
[01:04:01.448 --> 01:04:03.929]  And see, they don't think they're being held responsible for this.
[01:04:04.869 --> 01:04:11.172]  Because all the Democrats and all the globalists and all the socialists, they're all echo-chambering with each other.
[01:04:11.632 --> 01:04:13.612]  And they're all thinking they're getting away with what they're doing.
[01:04:13.632 --> 01:04:14.893]  You're not getting away with it.
[01:04:15.526 --> 01:04:22.488]  You're force-fed everywhere, you're put at the top of Google, the top of Bing, the top of everything, and still your ratings are sliding towards no viewers.
[01:04:23.168 --> 01:04:32.831]  And the few that watch you are making fun of you or laughing at you, and the biggest audiences you have is in talk radio and conservative media and nationalist media, people analyzing your lies.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:34.841]  And really, they kind of know that.
[01:04:34.861 --> 01:04:37.982]  The only way they're pertinent is just by being shock jocks.
[01:04:38.022 --> 01:04:39.063]  These people are shock jocks.
[01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.564]  I am a reality jock.
[01:04:41.544 --> 01:04:48.668]  And I am someone trying to punch a hole through their lies to discredit them so we can lead the rest of the people through the breach.
[01:04:49.048 --> 01:04:50.989]  And I think we've done that thanks to your support.
[01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:52.770]  Yes, folks, they give us the credit.
[01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:55.191]  They give you the credit for devastating the New World Order.
[01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:59.734]  Let me tell you, you are the globalist slayers politically, and I salute you.
[01:05:04.747 --> 01:05:05.888]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[01:05:05.948 --> 01:05:10.411]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[01:05:10.551 --> 01:05:12.773]  It's super silver skin cream.
[01:05:12.893 --> 01:05:16.596]  It's got all of these benefits, too many to mention, but it's revolutionary.
[01:05:16.756 --> 01:05:17.597]  It's brand new.
[01:05:17.697 --> 01:05:18.477]  People are going to love it.
[01:05:18.537 --> 01:05:22.040]  Introducing the new super silver skin cream exclusively for store.com.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:23.481]  25% off introductory price.
[01:05:23.501 --> 01:05:26.263]  The new super silver skin cream is the best of both worlds.
[01:05:26.303 --> 01:05:28.384]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[01:05:28.505 --> 01:05:30.306]  Super silver skin cream is infused with
[01:05:30.486 --> 01:05:31.107]  We're good to go.
[01:05:50.703 --> 01:05:52.204]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's August 30th.
[01:06:18.899 --> 01:06:19.499]  Think about that.
[01:06:20.119 --> 01:06:21.100]  Friday, August 30th, 2019.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:27.421]  And I'm going to plunge straight into the news right now.
[01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:29.642]  Where is the best place to start?
[01:06:30.322 --> 01:06:32.883]  I want to start with being above the law.
[01:06:34.263 --> 01:06:43.306]  And really, nobody's above the law for too long because then belief in the system goes away and civilization collapses.
[01:06:43.926 --> 01:06:46.907]  And sometimes systems are corrupt, very corrupt, and they need to collapse.
[01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:54.134]  But most of the time, when systems start collapsing, you get something even worse.
[01:06:54.414 --> 01:07:11.084]  And so, talking about above the law, you have these jail guards with Epstein, who had been brought in special, they told the others take off, and he was supposed to be on suicide watch, but was taken off that, but there were two cameras outside his cell, they both malfunctioned magically, and then the other inmates,
[01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:13.910]  Uh, at the facility, not controlled by the feds.
[01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:15.171]  It was a city facility.
[01:07:15.971 --> 01:07:18.492]  They heard yelling and screaming and him fighting for his life.
[01:07:18.532 --> 01:07:19.292]  And that's all come out.
[01:07:19.592 --> 01:07:20.972]  And he told people they're trying to kill me.
[01:07:21.192 --> 01:07:32.255]  And he told people, the guy that was in my cell, the cop that had four bodies found in his backyard, big gorilla guy, uh, that, uh, that, uh, this guy, um, you know, tried to kill him.
[01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:39.115]  Well, now this is up on InfoWars.com from InformationLiberation.com.
[01:07:39.475 --> 01:07:43.860]  Report, two cameras outside Jeffrey Epstein's cell malfunctioned.
[01:07:45.122 --> 01:07:47.004]  That's also being reported by Reuters, FBI.
[01:07:47.024 --> 01:07:50.648]  A study, two broken cameras outside the cell where Epstein died.
[01:07:51.149 --> 01:07:52.711]  Source, isn't that just cute?
[01:07:53.191 --> 01:07:54.212]  So we're talking about...
[01:07:55.545 --> 01:08:01.927]  Just not caring if you know the truth, not caring if you don't buy it, just kind of arrogantly saying, well, we're the power structure, we're going to move forward.
[01:08:02.847 --> 01:08:03.287]  Here's another one.
[01:08:03.327 --> 01:08:09.669]  Deep State wins again as James Comey gets away with FBI violations and illegal threats, illegal leaks.
[01:08:10.189 --> 01:08:19.491]  And if you pull up the New York Post headline, he's the leaker-in-chief, and it shows all these holes in him with these massive leaks.
[01:08:19.551 --> 01:08:22.752]  What's important is he told Congress that he never leaked.
[01:08:24.497 --> 01:08:25.558]  So that's lying to Congress.
[01:08:25.578 --> 01:08:26.940]  And then he leaked illegal stuff.
[01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:29.582]  And he's just gotten away with it.
[01:08:29.702 --> 01:08:33.206]  And then what he leaked, it turned out, was also not even true.
[01:08:34.748 --> 01:08:36.590]  Comey is a proven liar and a leaker.
[01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:43.477]  White House slams former FBI director after IG report.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:44.740]  I don't
[01:09:06.172 --> 01:09:15.075]  A big dossier of lies that they passed around and would vomit out, and the dog would eat the vomit again, and they would just do this whole circular vomit motion.
[01:09:16.615 --> 01:09:17.156]  Endlessly.
[01:09:18.076 --> 01:09:18.816]  Continually.
[01:09:19.636 --> 01:09:20.377]  Unceasingly.
[01:09:21.677 --> 01:09:25.058]  And now, the Justice Department is sweeping a lot of this under the rug.
[01:09:25.138 --> 01:09:29.179]  Yes, there's grand juries open in Maryland, and in D.C., and in Virginia.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:33.781]  And yes, there still may be indictments, and the word was that those indictments have been sealed.
[01:09:34.991 --> 01:09:38.394]  But you're seeing the Justice Department at the top saying, we don't want to prosecute.
[01:09:38.714 --> 01:09:39.435]  We don't want to go there.
[01:09:39.495 --> 01:09:48.662]  And clearly, Barr's been brought in to make the deal to get them to go away and stop and stop trying to overthrow the election.
[01:09:49.363 --> 01:09:56.169]  And just win fair and square, if they can, in the upcoming 2020 election next November.
[01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.431]  But they're not following that deal.
[01:09:59.743 --> 01:10:03.946]  Sure, it'll be painful, and it'll hurt the country and the stock market if we start arresting Hillary Clinton.
[01:10:04.406 --> 01:10:13.391]  But as I've said from the beginning, it has to be done, because her stay-behind networks are still in Google, still in Apple, still in Twitter, still in the CIA, still everywhere.
[01:10:13.411 --> 01:10:24.077]  And they're actively working with the CHICOMs and others to destroy our recovery, to destroy our currency, and saying they're doing it in the Washington Post!
[01:10:27.045 --> 01:10:28.646]  That Xi must defeat Trump!
[01:10:29.327 --> 01:10:30.948]  That Xi is the savior of America!
[01:10:31.288 --> 01:10:33.430]  These are the unreal headlines.
[01:10:35.612 --> 01:10:38.073]  Now shifting gears, as above so below.
[01:10:38.914 --> 01:10:42.096]  We've had the big fish up there getting away with it, at least for now.
[01:10:42.817 --> 01:10:43.778]  Trump loves curveballs.
[01:10:43.818 --> 01:10:45.679]  I don't think old Comey's out of the woods yet.
[01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:50.943]  Though he's set, I guess, to get a CNN job like his other discredited buddy, McCabe.
[01:10:52.424 --> 01:10:55.407]  Ex-NYPD detectives to get probation.
[01:10:56.305 --> 01:10:59.266]  For having sex with young women in custody.
[01:11:01.566 --> 01:11:08.749]  And they raped this woman, handcuffed in the back of a van, and they don't have to go to jail.
[01:11:08.809 --> 01:11:09.889]  What message does that send?
[01:11:10.289 --> 01:11:11.629]  But who else is above the law?
[01:11:12.249 --> 01:11:13.690]  Illegal aliens are allowed.
[01:11:15.390 --> 01:11:18.352]  To get DWIs, and they're given $25 fines.
[01:11:18.372 --> 01:11:23.496]  I mean, I've talked to local state prosecutors, county prosecutors, city prosecutors.
[01:11:23.516 --> 01:11:24.356]  This is all on record.
[01:11:24.376 --> 01:11:26.038]  It happens all over the country.
[01:11:26.478 --> 01:11:27.659]  They're told to release them.
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:35.805]  But in Europe and here as well, when the Islamists rape somebody, there have been courts in European countries that have said, oh, you raped a nine-year-old?
[01:11:35.845 --> 01:11:36.945]  That's part of your culture.
[01:11:37.926 --> 01:11:38.907]  Or you cut a woman up.
[01:11:38.967 --> 01:11:39.968]  Oh, you get a year in jail.
[01:11:40.168 --> 01:11:40.848]  You killed a woman.
[01:11:41.749 --> 01:11:42.950]  Oh, you hand-grenaded a family.
[01:11:43.885 --> 01:11:45.085]  Well, you get six months.
[01:11:46.366 --> 01:11:47.867]  The story's up on Breitbart.com.
[01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:52.168]  We have our own breakdown of it at NewsWars.com and EuropeWars.com.
[01:11:52.188 --> 01:11:53.949]  Those are sites that have a lot of original content.
[01:11:54.269 --> 01:11:56.710]  Probably want to check those out if you want to help get the word out and be informed.
[01:11:57.290 --> 01:12:00.431]  NewsWars.com, EuropeWars.com.
[01:12:01.932 --> 01:12:05.573]  Spain, single Algerian migrant arrested 14 times in 11 weeks.
[01:12:09.915 --> 01:12:18.358]  Of the top 10 worst offenders in Barcelona over the summer, an Algerian illegal migrant topped the list with 14 arrests over a period of 11 weeks.
[01:12:18.979 --> 01:12:22.520]  And do you want to guess all the stuff he did?
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:31.543]  Eight separate times for theft, six for acts of violence and intimidation, was part of a group of underage migrants who arrived in the city last year and went around robbing and stealing and attacking.
[01:12:31.824 --> 01:12:34.164]  So he probably got caught one out of ten times, they estimate.
[01:12:34.385 --> 01:12:35.245]  Generally, that's how it works.
[01:12:35.925 --> 01:12:36.765]  So, 14 arrests.
[01:12:38.695 --> 01:12:41.016]  We're talking 140 robberies or so.
[01:12:41.316 --> 01:12:42.137]  What a nice guy.
[01:12:44.158 --> 01:12:50.301]  Now, I haven't gotten to this yet, but I'm gonna get to it when we come back, because it's an illustration of extreme absurdity.
[01:12:52.202 --> 01:12:53.702]  And just how much they're lying.
[01:12:55.563 --> 01:12:59.545]  YouTube CEO says it's more important than ever to let people upload anything they want.
[01:12:59.585 --> 01:13:03.187]  So, Owen Schroeder saw this two days ago, put up a War Room page.
[01:13:04.776 --> 01:13:15.625]  In two hours, Media Matters and Vice, who watch us continually like the eye of Sauron, had it taken down, and it became a big national story, saying, well, you said they could come back, but they can't.
[01:13:17.707 --> 01:13:22.071]  As if we're begging, and oh, pleading, and oh, the big victory of slapping us down.
[01:13:22.691 --> 01:13:25.254]  But we pulled up some clips of her talking about how she wanted to silence me.
[01:13:26.482 --> 01:13:27.323]  You know, just recently.
[01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:31.045]  And so this is all lies for Congress, and all lies for the... Oh, you've got speech?
[01:13:31.085 --> 01:13:32.146]  No one's censoring anybody!
[01:13:32.546 --> 01:13:39.191]  Oh no, just Mitch McConnell had his Twitter frozen, and then, you know, Republicans can't send out strong women ads and say, we love strong women.
[01:13:39.451 --> 01:13:40.272]  Please join Trump.
[01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:47.477]  He wants to build a world for strong families and strong women, and has a leadership council to get women into higher levels of government and corporate leadership.
[01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:50.459]  Record skips, car wrecks sound.
[01:13:52.221 --> 01:13:52.881]  You can't do that.
[01:13:52.941 --> 01:13:53.802]  Facebook stands by it.
[01:13:54.342 --> 01:13:55.283]  Oh, there's no censorship.
[01:13:58.154 --> 01:13:59.395]  So Owen did that stunt.
[01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:01.295]  It was successful to show what a fraud she is.
[01:14:02.056 --> 01:14:03.196]  But they got David Knight.
[01:14:03.856 --> 01:14:06.678]  They kind of, you know, it's a cerebral nice family show.
[01:14:08.498 --> 01:14:09.819]  But they got rid of his channel.
[01:14:09.939 --> 01:14:12.180]  And it bums David out because he likes to reach people.
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.501]  But that's the way it works for just being associated with us.
[01:14:16.162 --> 01:14:20.844]  He goes to the Gulag as well because of all the good little leftists watching what we say.
[01:14:21.604 --> 01:14:22.444]  Watching what we do.
[01:14:24.522 --> 01:14:25.824]  The left's there to destroy free speech.
[01:14:25.864 --> 01:14:26.465]  That's their job.
[01:14:26.485 --> 01:14:28.768]  They're not scary or dangerous or anything.
[01:14:28.788 --> 01:14:30.750]  That's what Tucker Carlson said.
[01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:38.760]  We're going to go to break and come back and get into that, get into the huge developments in Europe with the Brexit and the Queen's, the pending Parliament after 400 years.
[01:14:38.881 --> 01:14:39.962]  This is big moves.
[01:14:39.982 --> 01:14:42.445]  It shows the world geopolitical realignment.
[01:14:43.342 --> 01:14:43.822]  It's happening.
[01:14:43.842 --> 01:14:48.006]  We put a video out yesterday from a live show that had the name, The Queen Joins the Liberty Movement.
[01:14:48.046 --> 01:14:49.207]  And I didn't write headlines yesterday.
[01:14:49.467 --> 01:14:50.407]  That's an okay one.
[01:14:50.427 --> 01:14:56.152]  But really, the Queen suspending Parliament signals the global political realignment is complete.
[01:14:56.852 --> 01:14:58.454]  And that the globalist model failed.
[01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:01.196]  And, I mean, it's a big deal.
[01:15:02.196 --> 01:15:02.756]  So that's coming up.
[01:15:27.802 --> 01:15:31.604]  And we're only able to sell it for so long at 3% off because we won't get more for like 10 weeks.
[01:15:32.004 --> 01:15:35.786]  And you get a free bottle of Carnivore Digestive Enzyme.
[01:15:36.566 --> 01:15:38.947]  That's a $17 value, just what it cost us to produce it.
[01:15:39.487 --> 01:15:40.108]  Absolutely free.
[01:15:40.128 --> 01:15:41.888]  I want you to experience this amazing digestive enzyme.
[01:15:42.089 --> 01:15:47.311]  We've never done a special this good, but I wanted to introduce folks on the fence about DNA Force or Carnivore with these together.
[01:15:47.331 --> 01:15:49.352]  98% reviews, you cannot beat it.
[01:15:49.652 --> 01:15:53.854]  Another big deal, 25% off Super Bowl Vitality with a free bottle of Carnivore as well.
[01:15:54.194 --> 01:15:55.895]  Take advantage of those and fund the info war.
[01:15:56.195 --> 01:15:56.856]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:56.896 --> 01:15:57.877]  Please take action.
[01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.758]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:15:59.918 --> 01:16:15.092]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[01:16:16.013 --> 01:16:16.734]  Josh in Washington.
[01:16:16.754 --> 01:16:17.234]  You're on the air.
[01:16:17.254 --> 01:16:17.554]  Go ahead.
[01:16:17.835 --> 01:16:18.975]  Alex, God bless you.
[01:16:19.136 --> 01:16:21.498]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:27.382]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:28.163]  Ooh, yeah.
[01:16:28.223 --> 01:16:29.544]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[01:16:29.584 --> 01:16:31.366]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[01:16:31.426 --> 01:16:32.306]  Fully changed my life.
[01:16:32.466 --> 01:16:35.529]  I use TurboForce, BodyEast, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[01:16:35.729 --> 01:16:37.992]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to
[01:16:53.510 --> 01:17:00.754]  That would be incredible, whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[01:17:00.894 --> 01:17:03.316]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel in the body.
[01:17:03.376 --> 01:17:05.777]  People think just dumping energy drinks on it will do something.
[01:17:05.797 --> 01:17:07.638]  No, if your base isn't there, none of it works.
[01:17:07.678 --> 01:17:10.920]  But you take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[01:17:10.980 --> 01:17:12.641]  Now you can build the big, strong temple.
[01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:13.722]  It's not that I'm perfect either.
[01:17:13.762 --> 01:17:14.802]  I've tricked my body really bad.
[01:17:14.842 --> 01:17:18.984]  But with these products I take, and I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[01:17:19.005 --> 01:17:21.786]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:22.527]  Thank you so much.
[01:17:22.607 --> 01:17:23.067]  God bless you.
[01:17:32.529 --> 01:17:33.970]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:36.010]  I love tuning in to Owen Troyer.
[01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:37.711]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:39.032]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:17:39.852 --> 01:17:44.274]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:46.875]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:17:47.075 --> 01:17:47.675]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:17:48.355 --> 01:17:49.096]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:17:50.123 --> 01:17:51.383]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:54.024]  And I want to expand to face the Globals, not contract.
[01:17:54.304 --> 01:17:55.065]  I don't want them to win.
[01:17:55.445 --> 01:17:57.465]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[01:17:58.366 --> 01:18:01.126]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:18:01.486 --> 01:18:04.247]  And we'll expand and really give the Globals enough of their money.
[01:18:04.627 --> 01:18:08.389]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:18:08.429 --> 01:18:09.649]  These will change your life.
[01:18:10.009 --> 01:18:11.370]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:13.111]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:18:13.411 --> 01:18:14.072]  Check it all out.
[01:18:14.092 --> 01:18:15.693]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:18:16.053 --> 01:18:17.654]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:18:17.834 --> 01:18:19.035]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:18:19.095 --> 01:18:20.476]  You can get great products at the same time.
[01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:22.937]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[01:18:23.258 --> 01:18:25.199]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[01:18:25.439 --> 01:18:28.541]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[01:18:39.286 --> 01:18:42.027]  The most banned network in the world.

[01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:49.410]  Two different sizes.
[01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:51.831]  Check it out for yourself, the ingredients.
[01:18:51.931 --> 01:18:54.212]  Research it for yourself and you will find out why.
[01:18:54.372 --> 01:19:00.475]  The crew here and the people behind this are so excited about Super Silver Skin Cream at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:19:00.655 --> 01:19:01.937]  It's all thanks to this audience.
[01:19:02.117 --> 01:19:03.078]  I cannot thank you enough.
[01:19:03.158 --> 01:19:04.200]  I cannot salute you enough.
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:07.244]  You make InfoWars go by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:32.321]  Now we've got multiple options, the grapefruit, the lavender scent, or unscented.
[01:19:32.341 --> 01:19:36.022]  It's the Super Silver Skin Cream and it's already 25% off.

[01:19:42.283 --> 01:19:45.704]  Probably nothing else like it, much like the Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel.

[01:19:51.706 --> 01:19:55.246]  Another brand new exclusive product only at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:08.370]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:19.738 --> 01:20:21.318]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:20:21.659 --> 01:20:27.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:29.881 --> 01:20:44.685]  Well, Susan Wojcicki is the titular head, the figurehead, the pawn, the masthead, the decoy,
[01:20:46.072 --> 01:20:56.862]  The distraction for the big, tentacled Chai Com Poroboskis that is Alphabet, Google, Global, New World Order, Deep State.
[01:20:56.902 --> 01:20:57.963]  Hold on, crank it back up for a minute.
[01:20:59.385 --> 01:21:04.509]  It's hard to turn that off, isn't it?
[01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:06.151]  La la, la la.
[01:21:06.171 --> 01:21:06.932]  La la, la la.
[01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:09.134]  And Wu Chitsky.
[01:21:11.348 --> 01:21:17.672]  Goes to all these events and, you know, says, oh, we're for free speech, but we got to stop Alex Jones and we want to shut him up.
[01:21:18.212 --> 01:21:24.376]  But then she came out two days ago and she said, we're open, we're free, we don't censor.
[01:21:25.337 --> 01:21:30.400]  And the Nazi SS don't wear black uniforms with twin lightning bolt insignia.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.001]  And George Washington didn't kick ass.
[01:21:33.642 --> 01:21:35.063]  And the sky is not blue.
[01:21:36.744 --> 01:21:38.345]  Shines white light in what it shows.
[01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:54.158]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen, let's play her at a conference a few months ago, slithering around, and then we'll get into the latest faux pas that she's been caught up in.
[01:21:54.478 --> 01:21:57.760]  But not at the sacrifice of David Knight's YouTube channel.
[01:21:57.961 --> 01:21:58.281]  Here it is.
[01:22:00.017 --> 01:22:01.718]  We have tightened our guidelines.
[01:22:01.878 --> 01:22:07.320]  We have made very significant changes in how we handle our policies, like the recommendations.
[01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:08.940]  So, getting to your son.
[01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:10.321]  He's lost.
[01:22:10.901 --> 01:22:13.702]  No, we can work on your son here.
[01:22:13.722 --> 01:22:17.584]  I have a son too, and I get some of these discussions also at the dinner table.
[01:22:18.411 --> 01:22:29.335]  Um, I mean, so, it's a, um, I think what you're describing is, and the way we think about it, too, look, there's a set of content that has to meet the community guidelines.
[01:22:29.415 --> 01:22:31.396]  Ben Shapiro's going to meet the community guidelines.
[01:22:31.416 --> 01:22:34.197]  So I don't think you're suggesting that we remove him from the platform.
[01:22:34.337 --> 01:22:34.597]  Are you?
[01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.178]  I would, but I can't.
[01:22:36.198 --> 01:22:36.498]  No, no.
[01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:37.098]  Okay, okay.
[01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:37.818]  But you know what?
[01:22:37.898 --> 01:22:44.361]  But no, you know, like, last time I saw you, I was like, get Alex Jones off that platform, and you're like, well, the community guidelines, and then you got him off.
[01:22:44.381 --> 01:22:45.321]  Well, now he's not on the platform.
[01:22:45.341 --> 01:22:45.641]  I know.
[01:22:45.781 --> 01:22:47.142]  So I was right, but that's just- Good job!
[01:22:49.309 --> 01:22:51.130]  It was the terms of service, actually.
[01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:52.230]  He broke the terms of service.
[01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:53.631]  He broke our terms of service, yes.
[01:22:53.871 --> 01:22:59.533]  But what I mean is, I'm getting to the larger picture, and then I do want to get to issues around diversity and other things.
[01:23:00.053 --> 01:23:05.536]  And Hong Kong is breaking China's terms of service of a dictatorship of the communists.
[01:23:05.696 --> 01:23:09.557]  Their grandparents ran there 70 years ago, and now they're arresting and killing people.
[01:23:10.258 --> 01:23:11.698]  Oh, because they broke the terms of service.
[01:23:12.539 --> 01:23:18.141]  But we're women at a women's conference in San Francisco, so it makes it okay if we're authoritarians.
[01:23:20.673 --> 01:23:22.795]  No, YouTube said I didn't break their terms of service.
[01:23:22.815 --> 01:23:26.177]  They tried to ban me for saying no one died at Parkland, which would be my right.
[01:23:26.318 --> 01:23:26.878]  I didn't say it.
[01:23:27.979 --> 01:23:30.661]  Drudge embarrassed them by putting the videos up that they said that.
[01:23:31.061 --> 01:23:32.142]  I said the police stood down.
[01:23:32.162 --> 01:23:34.564]  14 million views on two videos.
[01:23:35.304 --> 01:23:41.549]  And they put me back up and then a month later took us down and said that it was a decision made at the corporate level.
[01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:46.473]  So they won't even get their crap straight because these people don't run the company.
[01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:47.854]  They're the front person.
[01:23:50.407 --> 01:23:52.647]  It isn't even Eric Schmidt that runs it.
[01:23:53.188 --> 01:23:53.928]  And that's a fact.
[01:23:54.088 --> 01:23:56.468]  It's the global deep state, and that's all coming out.
[01:23:56.828 --> 01:24:03.290]  So, she came out on the 27th, so three days ago, two and a half days ago, and it was all over the news.
[01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:07.210]  YouTube's CEO says it's more important than ever to let people upload anything they want.
[01:24:07.911 --> 01:24:09.471]  She goes on to say, we don't censor anybody.
[01:24:09.731 --> 01:24:11.811]  But they play this game and say, oh, but it's our community standards.
[01:24:13.392 --> 01:24:17.332]  Well, Owen Schroyer then, two days ago, says, oh, really?
[01:24:18.133 --> 01:24:19.853]  So he posted the war room of the live stream.
[01:24:21.701 --> 01:24:22.021]  I think?
[01:24:44.022 --> 01:24:47.950]  Wolchicki responds to it and says, oh, well, he doesn't count.
[01:24:48.471 --> 01:24:50.575]  Everyone has speech unless we say you don't.
[01:24:50.895 --> 01:24:51.977]  Then you just disappear.
[01:24:53.766 --> 01:24:58.267]  But I'm wearing little jeans and boots, and I like girls, so it's okay.
[01:24:58.707 --> 01:24:59.847]  Hey lady, I don't care if you like girls.
[01:24:59.887 --> 01:25:04.128]  I like girls too, but does it make it okay for you to do all the lying stuff you do?
[01:25:04.188 --> 01:25:06.668]  Of course, you don't really run the company, so it's okay.
[01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:11.709]  You just go out and do PR and play patty cake and, oh, we're liberal!
[01:25:12.009 --> 01:25:12.470]  No, you're not.
[01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:14.310]  You're fascist dirtbags.
[01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:15.830]  And you're dangerous.
[01:25:18.351 --> 01:25:19.351]  So, again, Owen,
[01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.790]  Did the show.
[01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:23.312]  I didn't even know he'd done that because I wasn't watching the start of the show.
[01:25:24.032 --> 01:25:30.036]  I was running around having fun, decided I saw a meme about tinfoil they were about to play at Info Wars.
[01:25:30.396 --> 01:25:31.957]  So I said, oh, give me some tinfoil.
[01:25:32.237 --> 01:25:35.719]  So I put a tinfoil hat on it with an antenna that we can roll some of that.
[01:25:35.759 --> 01:25:36.260]  We come back.
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:38.761]  That'll fit with carpe dondum and the whole flavor of today's show.
[01:25:38.781 --> 01:25:39.201]  We come back.
[01:25:39.221 --> 01:25:39.682]  We'll play that.
[01:25:40.642 --> 01:25:42.804]  But then I walked the catwalk.
[01:25:42.824 --> 01:25:46.386]  I mean, I made that on my own like 30 seconds, but shows I've got some style.
[01:25:46.486 --> 01:25:47.667]  OK, you ever seen one like that?
[01:25:47.687 --> 01:25:49.608]  Kind of the plumage or like the Roman
[01:25:53.322 --> 01:25:54.203]  Top of the visor.
[01:25:54.223 --> 01:25:57.146]  I mean, it's style, okay?
[01:25:57.306 --> 01:25:58.427]  So that's all coming up.
[01:26:00.049 --> 01:26:01.190]  But here they are celebrating.
[01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:02.431]  Oh, we got him again!
[01:26:02.691 --> 01:26:03.292]  Oh, yay!
[01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.474]  But then they tell Congress, none of this is happening.
[01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:06.135]  None of this is going on.
[01:26:08.037 --> 01:26:13.482]  Now, this is as good a time as any to really formally announce something very, very exciting.
[01:26:13.922 --> 01:26:15.124]  So we can roll some of the graphics of that.
[01:26:15.824 --> 01:26:17.046]  Band.video.
[01:26:18.393 --> 01:26:29.700]  Has been set up so that my show, Owen's show, David Knight's show, stuff Paul Watson does, other podcasts we do, is all easily searched, commentable at one place.
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:34.262]  It'll still be on InfoWars, but not, you know, stuff to dig through.
[01:26:34.282 --> 01:26:35.943]  It's all very easily searchable.
[01:26:36.063 --> 01:26:38.525]  It works on all devices, like an app, but it's not an app.
[01:26:39.957 --> 01:26:41.918]  It works on everything and we're really, really proud of it.
[01:26:41.938 --> 01:26:43.959]  Maybe we should put those graphics full on screen for folks.
[01:26:43.979 --> 01:26:45.539]  I want them to really be able to see these.
[01:26:46.319 --> 01:26:48.820]  So again, band.video.
[01:26:49.501 --> 01:26:50.621]  And here's the great part.
[01:26:51.602 --> 01:26:57.684]  Because of infiltrators and folks will try to come on and set us up, at first it can't be completely open to the public because they send provocateurs in.
[01:26:58.584 --> 01:27:02.746]  But we're going to have a long list of folks that we have as contributors.
[01:27:04.727 --> 01:27:11.730]  And we'll have the whole DMCA, you know, take down Digital Millennium Copyright Act deal where you're a contributor but you don't work for M4s and we don't tell you what to do.
[01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:19.153]  But as long as you follow, like, you know, don't say murder people or, you know, don't do illegal stuff, we're going back to when the internet was free.
[01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:25.624]  With the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, DMCA, Digital Safe Harbor Act.
[01:27:25.644 --> 01:27:27.906]  We're gonna follow what big tech's supposed to follow.
[01:27:28.747 --> 01:27:39.276]  And as long as it's not illegal, as long as it doesn't violate somebody's copyright, as long as it is your video, ladies and gentlemen, you will have a home at band.video.
[01:27:39.657 --> 01:27:42.639]  And that complements the great work over at Brighteon and what Mike Adams is doing.
[01:27:42.979 --> 01:27:44.561]  We're not in competition with anybody.
[01:27:46.127 --> 01:28:08.125]  We just want to stop the globalists from being able to shut everybody down so this way you can have embeddable videos from us but also from a long list of contributors that we're going to start adding on to it and giving a place on the site where InfoWars pays for the bandwidth and InfoWars sits there and promotes it and it's going to get really big because we've had 600 plus million views
[01:28:09.817 --> 01:28:13.703]  On our live streams in just the last six months on Infowars.com.
[01:28:13.863 --> 01:28:14.504]  Very expensive.
[01:28:15.345 --> 01:28:19.851]  And we've had hundreds and hundreds of millions of views since we got banned in the last year on our own videos.
[01:28:20.893 --> 01:28:23.536]  I mean, hell, 14 million just when drugs linked to those two videos.
[01:28:23.556 --> 01:28:24.197]  They went viral.
[01:28:24.498 --> 01:28:25.860]  This is what Alex Jones really said.
[01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:28.230]  Versus what they're saying, he said.
[01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:29.771]  So it's so important that we have a voice.
[01:28:30.251 --> 01:28:35.153]  So when they say we said something, or they say you said something, you can go, no, I didn't say kill the Jews.
[01:28:36.173 --> 01:28:36.733]  You're a liar.
[01:28:36.813 --> 01:28:38.054]  You're the one saying it in my name.
[01:28:38.674 --> 01:28:40.775]  Or whatever they put out, we can show what we really said.
[01:28:40.795 --> 01:28:44.636]  So band.video is the answer to Luchitsky.
[01:28:45.296 --> 01:28:50.061]  And the rest of these authoritarians running around in female garb camouflaging their authoritarianism.
[01:28:50.421 --> 01:28:59.611]  Somebody else that's launched something because of the Donald censoring and all the rest of it being censored on Reddit is CarpeDomptem and MeanWorld.com.
[01:28:59.631 --> 01:29:00.372]  He joins us next.
[01:29:08.937 --> 01:29:12.300]  We have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[01:29:13.021 --> 01:29:20.147]  We have to level them, because if there are survivors, if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.
[01:29:20.187 --> 01:29:29.155]  Jennifer Rubin, a senior writer at the Washington Post, said that if conservatives and Trump supporters can weather the storm of lawsuits, harassment,
[01:29:29.855 --> 01:29:30.396]  Death threats.
[01:29:30.476 --> 01:29:32.898]  We need to just physically burn them down.
[01:29:33.078 --> 01:29:34.980]  She says there must be no survivors.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:36.601]  What do you think Infowars is?
[01:29:36.762 --> 01:29:37.983]  What do you think we're going through?
[01:29:38.063 --> 01:29:38.964]  You're the target, though.
[01:29:39.044 --> 01:29:41.586]  But I've dared to challenge their Queen Hillary.
[01:29:42.007 --> 01:29:44.089]  I dared to mobilize the population.
[01:29:44.469 --> 01:29:46.070]  You dared to mobilize the population.
[01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:46.871]  And we're here.
[01:29:47.011 --> 01:29:49.674]  And we have energized the core of the nation.
[01:29:49.714 --> 01:29:50.875]  Black, white, old, young.
[01:29:50.995 --> 01:29:52.977]  And people don't buy the propaganda anymore.
[01:29:53.097 --> 01:30:00.303]  I have so many people walk up to me and they say, you know, I didn't even used to be a fan of yours until I heard them lie about you and I had to go hear what you were saying to find out why they were after you.
[01:30:00.323 --> 01:30:02.245]  And man, you've got an amazing broadcast.
[01:30:03.787 --> 01:30:05.688]  I'm shaking more hands than I've ever shook.
[01:30:07.090 --> 01:30:09.271]  I'm getting more support on the ground.
[01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:14.413]  But not financial, because it's only a core audience that actually buys the products.
[01:30:14.433 --> 01:30:22.258]  We're doing something very special, and I can tell you, this special is the very best special we've ever done, particularly with this type of sale.
[01:30:22.278 --> 01:30:24.199]  It's a type of sale we've never engaged in.
[01:30:24.319 --> 01:30:31.704]  But DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10, and everything else you need for your telomeres, your cells, energy, it's the base you need for everything.
[01:30:32.005 --> 01:30:34.166]  If you don't have this, no amount of energy drink's gonna help you.
[01:30:34.326 --> 01:30:35.487]  It's the fount of it all.
[01:30:35.607 --> 01:30:39.830]  It's the very best, you name it, nootropic, antioxidant for your cells.
[01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:42.792]  It's just, and this has got a bunch of patented stuff you can make claims on.
[01:30:42.933 --> 01:30:44.414]  It's unbelievable.
[01:30:44.434 --> 01:30:45.094]  98% reviews.
[01:30:45.134 --> 01:30:45.895]  Memphoreshore.com.
[01:30:45.915 --> 01:30:46.595]  Let me go further.
[01:30:46.755 --> 01:30:49.097]  Super Mill Vitality is our second bestseller.
[01:30:49.297 --> 01:30:52.099]  I don't need to sit there and tell you how great it is.
[01:30:52.199 --> 01:30:57.343]  Cold-pressed herbs, wild harvested, so that they keep their psycho active.
[01:30:57.423 --> 01:30:58.624]  I mean, it's the brain, everything.
[01:30:58.724 --> 01:30:59.865]  Libido, energy, stamina.
[01:31:00.025 --> 01:31:00.606]  Carnivore.
[01:31:00.786 --> 01:31:01.907]  Digestive enzymes.
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:08.143]  This is a product that's been popular with people that know what they're doing, but overall, not a popular product.
[01:31:08.543 --> 01:31:11.004]  I'm not going to get into what these expensive enzymes do.
[01:31:11.124 --> 01:31:14.366]  They don't just help you break down fat or break down protein in the gut.
[01:31:14.506 --> 01:31:15.746]  It does it in the intestines.
[01:31:15.887 --> 01:31:20.849]  If you want to flush out the meat you've been eating and you want to really get healthy, this is amazing.
[01:31:20.909 --> 01:31:21.630]  It's next level.
[01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:22.790]  And so guess what I'm doing?
[01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:25.672]  We are going to give it to you free.
[01:31:25.912 --> 01:31:28.673]  This is the biggest sale of these two items I've ever done.
[01:31:28.693 --> 01:31:31.815]  You get a free bottle of Carnivore with DNA Force, the 90 count one.
[01:31:32.355 --> 01:31:35.557]  And with Super Mel Vitality, you get a free bottle of the 30-count Carnivore.
[01:31:35.698 --> 01:31:43.223]  Carnivore literally is incredible, so get those today at InfoWarsStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:31:43.363 --> 01:31:48.407]  We're giving it to you free at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:48.647 --> 01:31:55.132]  Take advantage of those two specials on Super Mel Vitality and DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:31:55.373 --> 01:31:56.333]  Without you, we won't be here.
[01:31:56.393 --> 01:31:57.614]  With you, we will prevail.
[01:32:02.634 --> 01:32:04.235]  They've not shut down our speech!
[01:32:04.495 --> 01:32:09.779]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[01:32:09.999 --> 01:32:17.164]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:32:17.504 --> 01:32:18.305]  Are you coming back?
[01:32:18.825 --> 01:32:19.926]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[01:32:20.586 --> 01:32:21.627]  We're at Newshorse.com.
[01:32:21.667 --> 01:32:24.150]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.news.
[01:32:24.190 --> 01:32:25.912]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[01:32:26.192 --> 01:32:30.718]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[01:32:30.958 --> 01:32:33.200]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:36.184]  InfoWars.com, man!
[01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:36.804]  Woo!
[01:32:39.531 --> 01:32:42.293]  InfoWars.com, because that's what's people out here.
[01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:43.714]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[01:32:44.135 --> 01:32:46.777]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:46.877 --> 01:32:49.038]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[01:32:49.079 --> 01:32:52.561]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[01:32:52.601 --> 01:32:55.243]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[01:32:55.323 --> 01:32:57.585]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:32:57.625 --> 01:32:58.386]  That's where they find it.
[01:32:58.726 --> 01:32:59.927]  You know, there's things called websites.
[01:33:00.587 --> 01:33:01.008]  Just go there.
[01:33:06.784 --> 01:33:22.550]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.471 --> 01:33:31.733]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:46.474 --> 01:33:47.335]  You know why I feel so good?
[01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:48.496]  Why I'm so fired up right now?
[01:33:48.816 --> 01:33:52.179]  Because we've almost got our hands around the pedophiles next.
[01:33:52.379 --> 01:33:53.120]  The devil worshippers.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:55.081]  We've got them in our sights.
[01:33:55.882 --> 01:33:57.544]  We've already cut down a lot of their minions.
[01:33:58.444 --> 01:34:01.907]  And we're getting right down to the center of the nest very soon.
[01:34:01.927 --> 01:34:04.189]  We're gonna have some big fights coming.
[01:34:05.931 --> 01:34:08.233]  But this is where humanity turns the corner.
[01:34:09.213 --> 01:34:10.314]  In the trajectory.
[01:34:11.195 --> 01:34:17.360]  Towards going Type 1 Civilization, which I know is my main mission, and I know that you also have that mission as well.
[01:34:18.481 --> 01:34:20.583]  You feel as I feel, you know what I know.
[01:34:20.603 --> 01:34:23.986]  You didn't get it from me, you already had it in your heart, in your mind, in your soul.
[01:34:24.006 --> 01:34:27.148]  And I don't know where to start here.
[01:34:28.329 --> 01:34:35.095]  We've got Memeworld.com already censored on Facebook, within hours of it being launched, because memes, the EU said,
[01:34:37.512 --> 01:34:38.293]  Are bringing them down.
[01:34:38.513 --> 01:34:39.093]  Oh, guess what?
[01:34:39.113 --> 01:34:44.998]  The nationalist right-wing party, anti-New World Order party, is set to remove Merkel completely.
[01:34:45.538 --> 01:34:47.440]  We got like 16 big parties over there.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:52.724]  She keeps playing games with the other coalitions, but that's only resulted in the right-wing set to take over Germany.
[01:34:54.906 --> 01:34:56.447]  And dismantle their entire system.
[01:34:58.448 --> 01:35:02.492]  So, I got a bunch of these great memes that have been submitted and posted by the contributors at
[01:35:03.376 --> 01:35:04.536]  Memeworld.com.
[01:35:05.437 --> 01:35:07.818]  And again, this is show we have our own sites.
[01:35:08.118 --> 01:35:08.998]  I'm glad he's done this.
[01:35:09.058 --> 01:35:18.042]  We launched Band.video, where we're going to invite all these same contributors to come have accounts there that we'll then post on InfoWars and just get the information out.
[01:35:18.062 --> 01:35:21.163]  Do what Matt Drudge came here almost four years ago to warn us to do.
[01:35:21.683 --> 01:35:23.044]  Build your own infrastructure now.
[01:35:23.544 --> 01:35:25.045]  Krypton is unstable.
[01:35:25.125 --> 01:35:26.125]  It's going to explode.
[01:35:26.665 --> 01:35:28.366]  You've got to get off the planet.
[01:35:28.886 --> 01:35:30.467]  You've got to get out of the digital gulag.
[01:35:31.027 --> 01:35:32.288]  And most people didn't listen.
[01:35:32.828 --> 01:35:35.830]  We were already doing it, but I accelerated it, so we're still here.
[01:35:36.891 --> 01:35:46.597]  And so I'm trying to have InfoWars be a infrastructure or a skeletal system to try to help boost others as well.
[01:35:46.657 --> 01:35:55.042]  And, you know, we have so many great activists that come in here, whether it's Gavin McGinnis or whether it was Count Dankula.
[01:35:55.182 --> 01:35:57.324]  Count Dankula told me at dinner, he said, no, I was going to quit.
[01:35:58.018 --> 01:36:04.182]  When they put me in jail for a Hitler dog joke, like a John Cleese joke, Monty Python, it was just totally normal.
[01:36:04.202 --> 01:36:05.623]  Even if it was bad, he should have a right to do it.
[01:36:05.663 --> 01:36:06.183]  But it wasn't.
[01:36:06.203 --> 01:36:06.644]  It was funny.
[01:36:06.664 --> 01:36:07.804]  It wasn't meant to be mean.
[01:36:07.824 --> 01:36:10.246]  But he has a right to do that anyways.
[01:36:11.106 --> 01:36:14.709]  And he said, I was going to quit until you had me on.
[01:36:14.729 --> 01:36:19.232]  And Paul helped me and had me to his house and promoted me to his folks.
[01:36:19.312 --> 01:36:21.433]  And it was the same thing with Gavin McGinnis.
[01:36:21.453 --> 01:36:22.354]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:36:22.694 --> 01:36:23.775]  It's happened with so many people.
[01:36:24.335 --> 01:36:25.436]  I'm here to help people.
[01:36:26.116 --> 01:36:27.177]  I'm here to boost people.
[01:36:27.237 --> 01:36:31.519]  I mean, Matt Drudge, and I don't even want to give him the credit because they're targeting more, but they already know.
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:43.426]  Infowars would not have survived and been able to expand a little the last two years under this massive attack if it wasn't for Matt Drudge.
[01:36:43.606 --> 01:36:44.847]  I mean, I haven't been paid in a year.
[01:36:44.887 --> 01:36:45.467]  That's fine.
[01:36:45.507 --> 01:36:49.350]  I'm living off money I saved before in case I ever needed to spend it on the operation.
[01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:51.571]  I'll sell everything I've got to run this operation.
[01:36:51.811 --> 01:36:52.952]  That was just funded a few months.
[01:36:54.873 --> 01:37:01.299]  It's a pleasure to hire key new people and still be expanding in the face of all the censorship and attacks.
[01:37:01.900 --> 01:37:03.101]  That is so satisfying.
[01:37:03.641 --> 01:37:11.228]  That's like the second most valuable thing to me in my life, after my children, is that they want me shut up, they want me shut down, they want you shut up and shut down.
[01:37:12.569 --> 01:37:18.333]  Fighting spirit that was already in me and my ancestors that's in you is so strong now.
[01:37:19.033 --> 01:37:20.875]  People are asking me, they say, what are you on?
[01:37:21.715 --> 01:37:23.977]  Why are you like, how do you work 18 hours a day?
[01:37:24.377 --> 01:37:26.058]  Why are you on fire now?
[01:37:27.839 --> 01:37:29.160]  Because I knew we could win.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:31.982]  And I'm seeing good things happen.
[01:37:32.022 --> 01:37:37.225]  I'm seeing us come from thousands of points behind to neck and neck with the new world order right now.
[01:37:38.606 --> 01:37:39.507]  And I have optimism.
[01:37:40.808 --> 01:37:40.948]  And
[01:37:42.762 --> 01:37:43.563]  I have confidence.
[01:37:44.463 --> 01:38:01.394]  Not confidence that's made up, but real confidence based in 25 years of hardcore, in the trenches, from the very grassroots, right to the top, to then be savagely attacked and to come out even stronger because of you supporting us.
[01:38:02.175 --> 01:38:06.938]  So I salute you and I appreciate you, but here's an example that our great guy,
[01:38:09.372 --> 01:38:11.193]  It's been heading up for 7, 8, 9 years.
[01:38:11.254 --> 01:38:12.134]  Our social media.
[01:38:12.254 --> 01:38:12.815]  Lewis brought me.
[01:38:12.835 --> 01:38:16.938]  He said, I don't even want to tell you about this because, you know, I don't even really consider these things or worry about it.
[01:38:17.659 --> 01:38:19.460]  We go out on any platform we can out there.
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.722]  It's really up to you to promote it however you do it.
[01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:23.663]  But Twitch, we've been on it for years.
[01:38:24.344 --> 01:38:25.905]  It had, you know, 10,000 followers, whatever.
[01:38:25.965 --> 01:38:26.786]  It was a small platform.
[01:38:26.806 --> 01:38:28.607]  We reached millions there over the years.
[01:38:29.828 --> 01:38:31.850]  And hello, InfoWarsLive.
[01:38:33.424 --> 01:38:37.585]  Based on review of your activity and content, we have issued a community guidelines strike on your account.
[01:38:38.025 --> 01:38:40.486]  As a result, your access to Twitch services is restricted.
[01:38:41.046 --> 01:38:44.668]  Reason, accidental improper handling of terrorist propaganda.
[01:38:47.228 --> 01:38:50.109]  That means I'm sure the video is us showing ISIS or Al Qaeda.
[01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:58.332]  The last thing we did in the video, we think that it was showing ISIS video bloopers that the mainstream news was showing.
[01:39:00.578 --> 01:39:04.321]  But see, we can't, we can't show that, but everybody else can.
[01:39:05.482 --> 01:39:06.642]  And now Amazon's bought that.
[01:39:07.603 --> 01:39:17.170]  And you know, if Amazon, which is not as bad as Google and Apple moving to China, wants people to stop taking the gloves off, then stop it, Bezos.
[01:39:17.870 --> 01:39:19.351]  Don't go along with the rest of Big Tech.
[01:39:19.371 --> 01:39:21.113]  And he probably doesn't even know this went on.
[01:39:21.473 --> 01:39:25.616]  So Jeff Bezos, if you're listening, and I, we all know you are.
[01:39:25.636 --> 01:39:27.837]  Not gonna get into that, okay?
[01:39:29.479 --> 01:39:29.919]  It's just,
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.540]  Knock it off!
[01:39:35.242 --> 01:39:39.204]  Continuing where the violation occurred on stream or VOD.
[01:39:40.404 --> 01:39:42.585]  Content related to this violation may be removed.
[01:39:44.026 --> 01:39:45.247]  Suspension link indefinite.
[01:39:46.387 --> 01:39:51.910]  Trying to get around the restriction can result in longer suspension and may lead us to reject any suspension appeals you might submit.
[01:39:53.271 --> 01:39:56.512]  Due to your suspension for 30 days, any subscriptions you have will no longer renew.
[01:39:57.273 --> 01:40:00.434]  To make changes to your subscriptions while suspended, please contact us.
[01:40:01.375 --> 01:40:01.555]  I mean,
[01:40:05.063 --> 01:40:07.446]  We're not going to tell you what it is, but it is.
[01:40:07.507 --> 01:40:18.863]  Now let's bring in Carpe Dunctum, who again was one of the main leaders at the big social media censorship summit a month or so ago.
[01:40:19.941 --> 01:40:21.381]  And we'll go a little bit in the next hour.
[01:40:21.401 --> 01:40:22.442]  The Lord Monk is going to join us.
[01:40:22.482 --> 01:40:23.522]  I appreciate you getting on here.
[01:40:23.542 --> 01:40:25.162]  I don't want to just harp about censorship all day.
[01:40:25.182 --> 01:40:26.483]  I want to talk about the good news.
[01:40:27.443 --> 01:40:30.624]  The Justice Department is canceling Google's undersea cable from China.
[01:40:31.124 --> 01:40:32.144]  That's how you really hit them.
[01:40:32.925 --> 01:40:34.725]  And Trump said he's getting ready with the executive order.
[01:40:34.745 --> 01:40:35.945]  I know you're in contact with the White House.
[01:40:35.965 --> 01:40:36.526]  We'll leave it at that.
[01:40:37.066 --> 01:40:41.167]  Any new word on when we're going to strike back against this, when the X-wings are going in?
[01:40:44.012 --> 01:41:03.848]  I don't have any new word on that, but I do think that Trump's posture towards China and towards tech censorship, which it's clearly happening even worse in China than it is here, but it's a blueprint for what they want to do here.
[01:41:03.868 --> 01:41:06.711]  I think that there's a
[01:41:08.186 --> 01:41:12.310]  A focus being put back onto it and I really hope that that's going to continue.
[01:41:13.171 --> 01:41:17.735]  I hope that Google just sees the decimation of their product.
[01:41:19.876 --> 01:41:29.065]  Now I got you on a little bit late here because I've been ranting, but what do you make of YouTube inviting everybody on and then Owen posts a page and they ban it and then celebrate banning him?
[01:41:29.325 --> 01:41:32.948]  I mean, they're talking out of both sides of their mouth.
[01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:34.790]  How long did it actually take?
[01:41:35.447 --> 01:41:36.428]  You were on that show!
[01:41:36.448 --> 01:41:37.748]  It was the show that you and I were on.
[01:41:37.768 --> 01:41:37.989]  Right.
[01:41:38.289 --> 01:41:39.410]  Running around with ten full hats.
[01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:42.351]  Yeah, how long did that take before it got taken down?
[01:41:42.571 --> 01:41:43.052]  Two hours.
[01:41:43.072 --> 01:41:43.332]  You know?
[01:41:43.632 --> 01:41:44.092]  Two hours?
[01:41:44.553 --> 01:41:44.753]  Yeah.
[01:41:44.953 --> 01:41:46.034]  Okay, that sounds about right.
[01:41:46.514 --> 01:41:52.418]  I mean, YouTube wants to take down anything they disagree with and they specifically want to get you off the air.
[01:41:53.758 --> 01:41:58.181]  Any of you or your viewers are a threat to
[01:42:00.002 --> 01:42:08.245]  Their bottom line and a threat to the way that they like to pull the wool over people's eyes Doesn't surprise me one bit.
[01:42:08.585 --> 01:42:25.210]  I'm more surprised that my channel is still up Well, they're really pushing it if they ban you because I know the president's taken a liking to you particularly won't get into that but It's just it's just it's just wild but it shows how weak they are that they're talking out of both sides of mouth.
[01:42:26.010 --> 01:42:27.411]  Oh exactly and
[01:42:28.237 --> 01:42:32.804]  That would be a big mistake, but I think it's something that they might try to do before 2020.
[01:42:32.844 --> 01:42:38.211]  I mean, they're gonna do their very best to make sure that everyone is gone.
[01:42:38.232 --> 01:42:39.694]  Anyone effective is out.
[01:42:41.025 --> 01:42:43.406]  And then play stupid the whole time and say it's not happening.
[01:42:43.446 --> 01:42:46.707]  Carpe Donctum from MemeWorld.com is our guest.
[01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:51.508]  We're gonna come back and play some of the memes he thinks are the best right now at MemeWorld.com.
[01:42:51.768 --> 01:42:54.549]  The Democrats and everybody say don't visit it and don't share it.
[01:42:54.889 --> 01:42:57.269]  Don't share MemeWorld.com, you dirty Americans.
[01:42:57.569 --> 01:42:58.310]  Don't share it.
[01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:59.430]  Just shut up and die.
[01:43:02.365 --> 01:43:15.919]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:18.682]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:43:19.083 --> 01:43:20.164]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:43:20.825 --> 01:43:24.488]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[01:43:25.129 --> 01:43:29.012]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:43:29.672 --> 01:43:30.253]  That's beautiful.
[01:43:30.713 --> 01:43:32.254]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:43:32.614 --> 01:43:33.615]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:43:34.215 --> 01:43:41.580]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.762]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:43:44.142 --> 01:43:48.005]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:43:48.205 --> 01:43:49.246]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:43:50.046 --> 01:43:53.816]  Whatever you do, spread those links because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:43:54.156 --> 01:43:54.998]  We are the resistance.
[01:43:55.259 --> 01:43:55.881]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[01:44:18.237 --> 01:44:22.418]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:44:23.018 --> 01:44:31.740]  Please don't forget, I guess the way that God works, or however this happens, we keep bringing in just the amount of money we need to operate.
[01:44:32.740 --> 01:44:33.900]  And I want to expand.
[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:36.361]  I want to watch new shows, which we're doing next month.
[01:44:37.221 --> 01:44:40.362]  I want to be able to put reporters in the field, like we've done with
[01:44:41.643 --> 01:44:43.424]  Overall, four reporters in Hong Kong.
[01:44:44.124 --> 01:44:46.706]  I want to be able to do all these things.
[01:44:46.886 --> 01:44:49.568]  And without you buying the products, we cannot do it.
[01:44:49.608 --> 01:44:51.590]  So just check out InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:57.014]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get a great air filter, get a great water filter you and your family need.
[01:44:57.074 --> 01:45:05.500]  Get the new nano silver skin cream that we've got from the same great folks that brought you super silver wound gel that's patented and so incredibly popular.
[01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:06.680]  This is proprietary.
[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.001]  We worked with them to develop this.
[01:45:08.141 --> 01:45:10.961]  This is a brand new thing that just came out last week.
[01:45:10.981 --> 01:45:12.762]  Folks are already getting it in their mail.
[01:45:12.822 --> 01:45:14.382]  We're already giving it five stars.
[01:45:14.522 --> 01:45:17.903]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to all the supplements and all the other products.
[01:45:18.083 --> 01:45:20.363]  Again, the Super Silver Wound Gel is a drug.
[01:45:20.423 --> 01:45:21.803]  It's FDA approved over-the-counter.
[01:45:21.923 --> 01:45:23.184]  Strongest available over-the-counter.
[01:45:23.224 --> 01:45:24.944]  This company let me private label that.
[01:45:25.064 --> 01:45:28.365]  We then discounted the Super Silver Cream
[01:45:29.145 --> 01:45:37.331]  Is the same nano silver but it's just not gone through all the approval to, you know, say approved for over-the-counter in the drug section.
[01:45:37.471 --> 01:45:38.591]  None of it means anything.
[01:45:38.731 --> 01:45:43.675]  Again, what the FDA does is they got a law passed in 96 trying to outlaw supplements and Congress said no.
[01:45:44.295 --> 01:45:45.416]  We're not saying we're drugs.
[01:45:45.597 --> 01:45:46.598]  You have no jurisdiction.
[01:45:46.678 --> 01:45:50.422]  So the FDA said, okay, well, you have to say not approved by the FDA.
[01:45:50.523 --> 01:45:53.045]  So they're always like, Jones sells unapproved things.
[01:45:53.226 --> 01:46:01.035]  Well, that's because the FDA makes all the supplement companies sit there and say that it is not approved by them because by law, they don't have
[01:46:01.195 --> 01:46:02.416]  We're good to go.
[01:46:19.574 --> 01:46:21.415]  It sells coffee!
[01:46:21.635 --> 01:46:22.436]  And toothpaste!
[01:46:22.476 --> 01:46:23.237]  Damn bastard!
[01:46:23.457 --> 01:46:24.898]  A scam that you need toothpaste!
[01:46:24.918 --> 01:46:27.139]  He's a... He's a toothpaste snake oil salesman.
[01:46:27.199 --> 01:46:27.720]  Well, guess what?
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:28.680]  People love Super Blue.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.141]  Fortifabrical oil, silver, and iodine.
[01:46:30.181 --> 01:46:31.202]  No fluoride is in it.
[01:46:31.222 --> 01:46:34.924]  So, again, we are very, very, very excited about all of this.
[01:46:34.944 --> 01:46:36.185]  We're energized by it.
[01:46:36.245 --> 01:46:38.627]  And this new product is really putting wind in our sails.
[01:46:38.647 --> 01:46:40.728]  The only problem is I put in a medium-sized order for it.
[01:46:40.748 --> 01:46:42.329]  Looks like it's gonna sell out in the next couple weeks.
[01:46:42.429 --> 01:46:44.571]  So I've gotta end the 25% off at the end of this week.
[01:46:44.631 --> 01:46:45.291]  Take advantage of it.
[01:46:45.351 --> 01:46:46.932]  We have it in the smaller containers.
[01:46:47.052 --> 01:46:49.274]  And we have it in the larger containers.
[01:46:49.414 --> 01:46:51.917]  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the smaller containers is $7.
[01:46:51.957 --> 01:46:53.238]  The larger container is $14.
[01:46:53.598 --> 01:46:54.659]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA.
[01:46:54.679 --> 01:46:54.699]  253-3139.
[01:46:54.739 --> 01:46:56.461]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:32.782 --> 01:47:41.669]  The human age is just beginning.
[01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:44.651]  The machines serve us.
[01:47:47.353 --> 01:47:50.436]  But men would tell you that we will serve the machines.
[01:47:50.536 --> 01:47:53.978]  No, those are men controlling machines that they believe will control us.
[01:47:54.359 --> 01:47:59.723]  But in Hong Kong and France, they're tearing down the surveillance poles with a face scanning.
[01:48:00.623 --> 01:48:01.844]  And the people are fighting back.
[01:48:02.685 --> 01:48:04.947]  Carpe Donkum with memeworld.com is our guest.
[01:48:06.108 --> 01:48:07.930]  Trump tweeted this out recently.
[01:48:07.950 --> 01:48:11.554]  It's a factory, an arsenal for the president to choose from.
[01:48:11.574 --> 01:48:13.916]  Just don't forget, that's what's happening.
[01:48:14.217 --> 01:48:18.201]  So be sure and always bombard the White House email on the campaign trail.
[01:48:19.162 --> 01:48:21.224]  Hopefully, I was talking to him off air last week.
[01:48:22.044 --> 01:48:26.165]  Well, it was a meme that made Ozzy Osbourne, or Sharon Osbourne, pretty upset.
[01:48:44.498 --> 01:49:00.788]  He tweeted out right after the problems at MSNBC during the debate when they were having all sorts of audio problems and there was somebody in the back talking about, I don't even remember what it was, like donuts or something.
[01:49:01.288 --> 01:49:02.949]  People talking backstage.
[01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:07.472]  So anyway, I turned it into something even better.
[01:49:08.032 --> 01:49:09.313]  And so again, here it is.
[01:49:09.333 --> 01:49:10.814]  You've probably seen it, but here it is, folks.
[01:49:11.174 --> 01:49:12.475]  We are less than 50 miles
[01:49:13.971 --> 01:49:18.394]  From Parkland, Florida, where 17 people were killed in a school shooting.
[01:49:18.414 --> 01:49:26.100]  We are going to catch the Trump in July 2016 when he took the stage in Cleveland, Ohio for the nomination.
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:27.701]  Talk about a flashback.
[01:49:52.812 --> 01:49:56.754]  Well, you know, there's been a lot of cringe moments from the campaign so far.
[01:49:56.774 --> 01:49:57.054]  Democrats
[01:50:15.655 --> 01:50:23.137]  You know, jogging or, you know, punching themselves in the face with the speedball and the speed bag.
[01:50:23.217 --> 01:50:34.220]  And so this is just one of those those Elizabeth Warren moments where she's, you know, jogging and she's just a normal person, just a normal millionaire that's.
[01:50:36.401 --> 01:50:41.742]  Used to be working at Harvard and pretended to be an American Indian and all those kind of things.
[01:50:43.483 --> 01:50:44.283]  Let's go ahead and roll that.
[01:50:44.303 --> 01:50:44.603]  Here it is.
[01:50:47.842 --> 01:50:48.803]  Alright, so all good.
[01:51:33.507 --> 01:51:40.738]  And again, this is not really for the radio, but this is Elizabeth Warren, head put on the famous deal of people rolling down and falling down the hills.
[01:51:42.492 --> 01:51:49.576]  Now, we're going to cue up one here that I just remembered that Darren McBreen put together last week that I never played.
[01:51:49.616 --> 01:51:50.956]  This has been on the David Knight Show.
[01:51:51.377 --> 01:51:52.377]  It's been on the War Room.
[01:51:53.058 --> 01:51:55.679]  But this particular clip is really good.
[01:51:55.719 --> 01:51:57.320]  But again, it's mainly made for TV.
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:51:59.341]  I don't know if it's posted to memeworld.com.
[01:52:00.041 --> 01:52:01.942]  I think Robbie was trying to get an account with you on there.
[01:52:01.962 --> 01:52:03.323]  He may have already done it.
[01:52:03.843 --> 01:52:07.905]  But this is obviously the Bernie Sanders hitting the punching bag and acting like a total buffoon.
[01:52:09.426 --> 01:52:10.307]  Cut to Rocky.
[01:52:10.347 --> 01:52:10.727]  Here it is.
[01:52:13.302 --> 01:52:14.883]  There's one thing I want you to do for me.
[01:52:15.244 --> 01:52:15.544]  What?
[01:52:15.564 --> 01:52:16.065]  Come here.
[01:52:17.586 --> 01:52:17.866]  Win.
[01:52:18.367 --> 01:52:19.328]  Win.
[01:52:19.348 --> 01:52:20.629]  What are we waiting for?
[01:52:20.649 --> 01:52:20.909]  Take this!
[01:52:45.696 --> 01:52:57.440]  I gotta say, Carpe Doctum, that one gives folks a run for the money, doesn't it?
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:58.160]  That was pretty good.
[01:52:58.780 --> 01:53:03.821]  I liked all the extra clips, the fisticuffs moves.
[01:53:03.841 --> 01:53:07.262]  By the way, you gotta take over and interrupt me sometime.
[01:53:07.322 --> 01:53:08.863]  I forgot the reason I got you on.
[01:53:08.883 --> 01:53:11.704]  I heard you're having a contest at memeworld.com.
[01:53:11.724 --> 01:53:12.524]  Can you tell us about that?
[01:53:13.901 --> 01:53:17.807]  Yeah, I've got a contest with American Priority Conference.
[01:53:18.768 --> 01:53:20.370]  We are running a meme contest.
[01:53:20.410 --> 01:53:21.872]  There's three prizes.
[01:53:23.093 --> 01:53:25.577]  It's all available on memeworld.com.
[01:53:30.245 --> 01:53:33.370]  Basically, we just want everyone to be involved.
[01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:35.393]  We want some people to win some prizes.
[01:53:36.414 --> 01:53:44.986]  We want to get more people to be involved on a regular basis, and I'm really hoping that we can find some good contributors out of this contest.
[01:53:46.328 --> 01:54:00.440]  But the main the main prizes are basically there's a there's an all expenses paid trip to Miami Florida to be a part of the American Priority Conference and then there's a $1,000 gift card and a $500 gift card.
[01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:07.245]  So it's a it's a it's a great opportunity for anybody that wants to kind of get into the whole meme game and and
[01:54:08.386 --> 01:54:09.607]  Get some recognition out there.
[01:54:09.627 --> 01:54:17.134]  I'll be posting either today or tomorrow some of the first look at some of the memes that have been sent in.
[01:54:17.174 --> 01:54:21.438]  I've got probably 100 emails over the last day or so.
[01:54:21.458 --> 01:54:23.440]  And let's be infinity clear.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:24.701]  Let's be infinity clear.
[01:54:24.721 --> 01:54:25.482]  Term I've coined.
[01:54:27.216 --> 01:54:30.940]  The system doesn't want you to engage in art or cave drawings or communications.
[01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:45.775]  The real underground newspapers in Rome for 800 years, as you know, from its very beginnings to its collapse, was all about drawing graffiti on the walls, countering what was being put out by the government criers who would come put out the official story.
[01:54:46.315 --> 01:54:51.837]  And so when the EU tries to ban them, and Big Tech tries to ban them, they just don't want you communicating with your fellow humans.
[01:54:51.897 --> 01:54:52.658]  It's outrageous.
[01:54:53.038 --> 01:54:54.058]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[01:54:54.078 --> 01:55:01.481]  The Chai Com started doing it a decade ago, as you know, not letting them make fun of Xi as Winnie the Pooh, not letting them share Taiwanese or Hong Kong flags.
[01:55:01.801 --> 01:55:03.882]  So people need to do this as their duty.
[01:55:04.242 --> 01:55:11.665]  I don't think people know the purge of, what, 200 million accounts in just the last month or so of people off Instagram and Facebook that were sharing memes.
[01:55:12.611 --> 01:55:14.472]  Yeah, Instagram was a really big one.
[01:55:14.552 --> 01:55:22.298]  I've had several people from Instagram contact me and tell me that they were one of the ones that had gotten banned.
[01:55:22.318 --> 01:55:25.020]  You know, they had, you know, 100,000 followers or something like that.
[01:55:25.701 --> 01:55:28.823]  And they've just suddenly been wiped off the map.
[01:55:29.363 --> 01:55:32.806]  And the thing with memes is that, I mean, you can write a
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:35.040]  Here's an example.
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:38.101]  You can tell somebody how beautiful a woman is.
[01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:56.862]  And try to describe it to them for an hour, and they won't get it.
[01:55:56.902 --> 01:55:59.924]  When you see the woman, then you understand what they were talking about.
[01:56:01.284 --> 01:56:02.985]  Or, you know, like a hit in the NFL.
[01:56:03.005 --> 01:56:05.026]  Like, man, he speared this guy.
[01:56:05.046 --> 01:56:06.827]  You could hear his ribs cave in.
[01:56:07.227 --> 01:56:07.968]  It's one thing to hear it.
[01:56:07.988 --> 01:56:08.888]  It's another thing to see it.
[01:56:09.108 --> 01:56:12.310]  And they're trying to kill the most basic human communication.
[01:56:12.730 --> 01:56:14.091]  Pictures on cave walls.
[01:56:15.236 --> 01:56:15.456]  Right.
[01:56:15.996 --> 01:56:18.917]  Yeah, there's a good example.
[01:56:18.937 --> 01:56:25.480]  I think that Ben does a great job of capturing the moment every single day.
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:27.340]  They wanted to destroy him.
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:30.862]  They tried to destroy him around the White House summit.
[01:56:31.122 --> 01:56:40.285]  They got him kicked out of the White House summit because of some obscure things that they said were anti-Semitic, which was a complete lie.
[01:56:40.705 --> 01:56:43.306]  So they want these people
[01:56:44.681 --> 01:56:46.142]  Number one to feel all alone.
[01:56:46.182 --> 01:56:47.263]  They want you to feel alone.
[01:56:47.923 --> 01:56:50.525]  They want you to feel like you're it's you against the world.
[01:56:50.605 --> 01:56:51.586]  Nobody's going to help you.
[01:56:51.606 --> 01:56:53.447]  Nobody will do anything for you.
[01:56:53.907 --> 01:56:59.151]  They want to make sure that you can't speak out and you're afraid to speak out and
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:03.283]  I feel like that no one's going to listen anyway, so what's the point?
[01:57:03.783 --> 01:57:12.773]  That's what they want to do and that's exactly what they're doing with all of these bans and, you know, threats of bans and policing language and things like that.
[01:57:12.873 --> 01:57:20.221]  In fact, this happened over the weekend and the crew will have time to grab it over the break, but the writer for the Washington Post, Ms.
[01:57:20.401 --> 01:57:20.741]  Rubin,
[01:57:21.582 --> 01:57:45.694]  She came out over the weekend and well it was actually last Friday but then we've been airing all week and she said it's time to drive them into submission burn them down give them nothing destroy his supporters bankrupt them crush them and there's a huge panel of like eight people going yes yeah I mean it's like you're watching some science fiction movie of a legion of doom going we'll crush the super friends and drive the city into submission everyone will bow to Zod they're like
[01:57:45.854 --> 01:57:46.675]  Hail Zod!
[01:57:46.755 --> 01:57:47.575]  Hail Zod!
[01:57:47.855 --> 01:57:50.177]  I mean, these people are flaming authoritarian!
[01:57:50.477 --> 01:57:51.557]  Hour number three!
[01:57:54.139 --> 01:57:58.321]  Here's Alex Jones displaying, putting the tinfoil hat on display.
[01:57:58.421 --> 01:58:10.389]  As you can see, the tinfoil hat, which was once a one-piece tinfoil hat meant to sit on your head comfortably, has now evolved into not just a tinfoil hat, but an adjustable antenna.
[01:58:10.449 --> 01:58:12.830]  So not only do you have the tinfoil hat,
[01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:24.555]  To protect yourself against fake news and predict the future, now it's included a tinfoil hat antenna, adjustable antenna, so you can pick up the InfoWars streams wherever you are on planet Earth.
[01:58:24.735 --> 01:58:29.357]  It's the brand new InfoWars tinfoil hat with adjustable antenna.
[01:58:29.397 --> 01:58:37.681]  We're working on getting the satellite feeds up and ready so that you can tune in to the InfoWars live broadcast with your tinfoil hat passion.
[01:58:37.961 --> 01:58:38.321]  Vogue.
[01:58:38.581 --> 01:58:38.881]  Power.
[01:58:39.241 --> 01:58:40.001]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:40.162 --> 01:58:41.022]  Tinfoil Hat.
[01:58:41.262 --> 01:58:46.343]  Now, Alex is a man of many talents, but you didn't know he had that type of catwalk ability.
[01:58:46.363 --> 01:58:47.563]  Just look at the attitude.
[01:58:47.863 --> 01:58:50.164]  Look at the flippant nature of defiance.
[01:58:50.484 --> 01:58:51.444]  Look at the rebellion.
[01:58:51.784 --> 01:58:53.264]  Oh, just total defiance.
[01:58:53.484 --> 01:58:58.546]  It's the brand new InfoWars Tinfoil and Tinfoil Hat with adjustable antenna.
[01:58:58.626 --> 01:59:04.567]  You can pick up HD audio of the Alex Jones Show with your brand new InfoWars Tinfoil Hat.
[01:59:04.687 --> 01:59:06.589]  We told you first about the fluoride in the water.
[01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:08.551]  We told you first about Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:59:08.691 --> 01:59:10.513]  Now you can hear it for yourself.
[01:59:10.714 --> 01:59:15.278]  Live time with the Info Wars tinfoil hat.
[01:59:15.379 --> 01:59:17.241]  How's the satellite feed coming in, Alex?
[01:59:17.421 --> 01:59:18.122]  Crystal clear.
[01:59:18.202 --> 01:59:18.902]  Crystal clear.
[01:59:19.123 --> 01:59:20.064]  HD feed, baby.
[01:59:22.796 --> 01:59:24.396]  So right now I'm on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:24.877 --> 01:59:30.378]  If I adjust the antenna approximately 30 degrees to the east, whoop!
[01:59:31.158 --> 01:59:32.799]  Now I've got the David Knight Show!
[01:59:33.859 --> 01:59:35.840]  Now I'm listening to David Knight this morning.
[01:59:35.880 --> 01:59:39.321]  He's talking about leftist cities and how they promote abortion.
[01:59:39.341 --> 01:59:44.382]  Hold on, let me just tune it now 60 degrees to the southwest and give it a little bend here.
[01:59:44.402 --> 01:59:46.623]  And now I'm tuned into the War Room!
[01:59:54.679 --> 01:59:58.791]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.313 --> 02:00:00.617]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:00:33.203 --> 02:00:39.325]  Alright, next segment I'll play Jennifer Rubin again saying drive them into submission, bully them, burn them down, destroy them.
[02:00:41.346 --> 02:00:55.450]  And they're all sitting there like they're dark lords, like they're generals that have run major wars and captured countries and run huge stockades and, you know, helped dispose of hundreds of thousands of dead bodies.
[02:00:56.170 --> 02:00:56.610]  But they're not.
[02:00:56.630 --> 02:00:57.911]  They're a bunch of chicken-necked
[02:01:02.648 --> 02:01:11.396]  No, I don't think so either.
[02:01:12.678 --> 02:01:18.364]  I think one of my favorite Tucker episodes is when Jennifer Rubin was on there and just made a complete fool of herself.
[02:01:19.405 --> 02:01:22.127]  She calls herself a, you know, a conservative
[02:01:23.544 --> 02:01:30.524]  A conservative blogger or columnist or something like that, but she's left of Bernie.
[02:01:31.257 --> 02:01:31.657]  You know, it's...
[02:01:58.363 --> 02:02:05.475]  It's a cliche on Twitter is, you know, there's always these stories and they always go viral because everybody wants to believe them.
[02:02:05.876 --> 02:02:11.606]  You know, it's like, you know, I was sitting in my house and my son came up to me and he says,
[02:02:12.944 --> 02:02:14.546]  Why is Trump such a racist?
[02:02:14.806 --> 02:02:16.888]  And you're like, this is a four-year-old kid, really?
[02:02:16.948 --> 02:02:18.689]  This four-year-old kid came up and said that to you?
[02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:20.231]  You know, and they go viral.
[02:02:20.571 --> 02:02:26.596]  I used to be a Trump supporter, but now I'm not because my kid came up and said that my president was a racist.
[02:02:26.897 --> 02:02:31.401]  You know, that's the stuff that all the leftists want to hear because they have to believe
[02:02:32.134 --> 02:02:43.740]  That they're making some sort of headway with all of their narratives that they run and all of the just the crap that they've been trying to sell to the country for the last three years.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.923]  If it doesn't work, they feel bad about it.
[02:02:48.963 --> 02:02:53.125]  Their sense of worth is tied to the lies that they've been telling.
[02:02:54.804 --> 02:02:56.045]  By the way, I love my crew.
[02:02:56.685 --> 02:02:58.966]  But there's Owen's whole crew, like five, six people.
[02:02:59.646 --> 02:03:01.467]  And I said, save that tinfoil hat.
[02:03:02.488 --> 02:03:04.169]  But I didn't say you, save the hat.
[02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:10.192]  I should have said, destroy this hat, throw it in Mount Doom, whatever you do, destroy this hat, and it would be here.
[02:03:10.492 --> 02:03:11.872]  But I said, hey, save that hat.
[02:03:12.553 --> 02:03:13.253]  So they threw it away.
[02:03:14.434 --> 02:03:16.675]  Well, you can always take your shirt off.
[02:03:16.795 --> 02:03:18.756]  I mean, that's the other part.
[02:03:20.049 --> 02:03:23.552]  So these are Alex Jones, but at least it's saved in cyberspace.
[02:03:24.032 --> 02:03:24.893]  Look at the style.
[02:03:24.933 --> 02:03:26.434]  I did that inspired.
[02:03:26.474 --> 02:03:28.575]  In 30 seconds, I made it without a mirror.
[02:03:28.695 --> 02:03:32.738]  And I kind of wanted a Roman plume, but it's also like an antenna.
[02:03:33.119 --> 02:03:35.641]  I mean, is this not 2020 style?
[02:03:36.061 --> 02:03:37.522]  It's going to be tinfoil clothing.
[02:03:38.363 --> 02:03:40.344]  It's very derelict.
[02:03:40.944 --> 02:03:41.585]  I think it's great.
[02:03:45.994 --> 02:03:50.817]  I think my favorite, though, was when you put your shirt up like Beavis and Budhead.
[02:03:50.857 --> 02:03:52.118]  I think that was my favorite part.
[02:03:54.119 --> 02:03:56.020]  Yeah, and I also stuck my belly up.
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:57.661]  There it is, dude!
[02:03:57.681 --> 02:03:59.723]  100% reviews.
[02:04:00.023 --> 02:03:59.723]  $29.95.
[02:04:00.183 --> 02:04:03.605]  Let's show me on the catwalk here.
[02:04:03.625 --> 02:04:05.726]  Again, radio listeners, you have to go to Infowars.com.
[02:04:05.927 --> 02:04:06.507]  It is posted.
[02:04:07.748 --> 02:04:11.170]  So I told the whole room of the great crew, I said, hey, save my hat.
[02:04:12.383 --> 02:04:14.485]  They probably just got busy, short attention spans.
[02:04:14.805 --> 02:04:15.606]  We got a great crew.
[02:04:15.646 --> 02:04:16.667]  We got to work on attention span.
[02:04:16.947 --> 02:04:21.691]  Here, I got a... Here's a tri-corner hat I'm wearing.
[02:04:21.711 --> 02:04:24.393]  A little too small, though.
[02:04:24.413 --> 02:04:24.473]  Ooh!
[02:04:25.254 --> 02:04:25.814]  That's nice.
[02:04:26.815 --> 02:04:27.996]  Well, it protects you from the 5G.
[02:04:28.576 --> 02:04:28.937]  It does.
[02:04:29.097 --> 02:04:30.558]  It does protect you from the 5G as well.
[02:04:30.598 --> 02:04:32.519]  Hey, Lana Del Rey's got me in a good mood.
[02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:33.720]  You like Lana Del Rey?
[02:04:35.442 --> 02:04:36.102]  Who's Lana Del Rey?
[02:04:37.571 --> 02:04:38.511]  You don't know who that is?
[02:04:39.232 --> 02:04:46.135]  No, I... I... I... Well, not only is he a very lovely lady... Hold on, we'll come in with an intro with her.
[02:04:46.155 --> 02:04:47.636]  Then we got Lord Malkin coming up.
[02:04:47.656 --> 02:04:48.697]  We'll ask him about her as well.
[02:04:49.657 --> 02:04:52.559]  I don't know if I'm inspired enough to make another temple hat.
[02:04:52.579 --> 02:04:54.680]  I mean, can I pull off that masterstroke again?
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:56.721]  I don't know.
[02:04:57.621 --> 02:04:58.822]  I think it's worth a try.
[02:04:59.042 --> 02:04:59.562]  We're gonna try.
[02:05:10.475 --> 02:05:11.616]  BAN.VIDEO!
[02:05:12.156 --> 02:05:13.336]  BAN.VIDEO!
[02:05:13.777 --> 02:05:14.977]  BAN.VIDEO!
[02:05:15.297 --> 02:05:16.418]  BAN.VIDEO!
[02:05:16.498 --> 02:05:17.519]  BAN.VIDEO!
[02:05:18.179 --> 02:05:22.081]  Shove that up your... For all you pieces of garbage New World Order.
[02:05:22.641 --> 02:05:24.682]  I'll tell you about that later, but you want to find out.
[02:05:25.122 --> 02:05:29.164]  It's Info Wars now, but soon, it'll be everybody else who wants to resist.
[02:05:29.725 --> 02:05:32.426]  We are building an army to bring down the government.
[02:05:35.746 --> 02:05:36.987]  So get out the way!
[02:05:37.267 --> 02:05:38.368]  Move, bitch!
[02:05:38.468 --> 02:05:39.488]  Get out the way!
[02:05:39.508 --> 02:05:40.849]  Move out the way, bitch!
[02:05:40.949 --> 02:05:41.810]  Get out the way!
[02:05:42.610 --> 02:05:43.171]  Sorry.
[02:05:43.851 --> 02:05:45.152]  Quoting Ludacris here.
[02:05:46.193 --> 02:05:47.393]  Move, O'Donnell!
[02:05:47.413 --> 02:05:48.434]  Get out the way!
[02:05:48.754 --> 02:05:49.715]  Move, O'Donnell!
[02:05:49.795 --> 02:05:50.695]  Get out the way!
[02:05:50.915 --> 02:05:51.696]  Get out the way!
[02:05:51.876 --> 02:05:52.757]  You see them headlights?
[02:05:53.037 --> 02:05:54.418]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[02:05:54.438 --> 02:05:56.399]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[02:05:56.459 --> 02:05:57.099]  Tell me that!
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:05:58.880]  Get out of my way!
[02:05:59.761 --> 02:06:01.142]  That's Americana, bitch!
[02:06:18.814 --> 02:06:19.434]  Beth and I love you.
[02:06:19.474 --> 02:06:19.955]  From Effing.
[02:06:20.555 --> 02:06:21.015]  Roman Rockwell.
[02:06:21.035 --> 02:06:22.596]  Turn up a little bit.
[02:06:22.696 --> 02:06:25.297]  My wife knows I got a crush on her.
[02:06:46.168 --> 02:06:47.029]  Crank it up.
[02:06:47.129 --> 02:06:52.974]  I mean, I already listened to Sorby's before.
[02:06:52.994 --> 02:06:56.457]  With this new album.
[02:06:57.338 --> 02:06:58.198]  Dream a little dream.
[02:07:02.765 --> 02:07:07.247]  And I just love the nostalgia in the piece as well, the music video.
[02:07:07.407 --> 02:07:10.928]  It's Americana stuff, and people are so hungry for that.
[02:07:10.988 --> 02:07:18.651]  And I know the inside baseball carpe d'antem, one of the top memers in the world, maybe the top memer in the world, after Ben Garrison, he's more of a political cartoonist.
[02:07:18.951 --> 02:07:21.632]  Garrison doesn't know what a powerful Jedi he is.
[02:07:22.112 --> 02:07:24.893]  I've explained that to him when he was down like six, seven years ago.
[02:07:24.913 --> 02:07:25.634]  I said, dude,
[02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:30.148]  You're the most prolific guy probably in history of political cartoons.
[02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:32.990]  So lick your wounds and, you know, get fired up.
[02:07:33.831 --> 02:07:38.434]  But this is a badge of honor that these trash come after us.
[02:07:38.514 --> 02:07:43.258]  But when we pull back, they're really trying to keep us from communicating with each other.
[02:07:43.298 --> 02:07:44.238]  And that's a human right.
[02:07:44.278 --> 02:07:45.920]  And these guys really are the baddies.
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:47.621]  They've got to be opposed, my friend.
[02:07:48.533 --> 02:07:48.773]  Right.
[02:07:48.953 --> 02:07:51.715]  And, you know, like I said before, that's what they want.
[02:07:51.755 --> 02:07:52.816]  They want you to shut down.
[02:07:52.916 --> 02:07:58.800]  They want you to feel like you can't do what you want and that they're just going to keep coming after you.
[02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:05.484]  So, I mean, I've talked to Ben as well, and I think that a lot of the stuff that happens to him weighs heavily on him.
[02:08:05.564 --> 02:08:09.327]  But, you know, he continues to make great political cartoons.
[02:08:09.367 --> 02:08:13.810]  He continues to put out content, and I support him in everything he does.
[02:08:14.150 --> 02:08:22.657]  And by the way, it's the celebration of people like you and the celebration of the average person and the Midwesterners and the hard-working people in New York and L.A.
[02:08:22.697 --> 02:08:27.240]  that are there taking care of their families and living in these globalist bubbles but still surviving.
[02:08:27.540 --> 02:08:32.664]  We've got to celebrate everybody that's human, no matter what color you are, where you came from, if you love liberty.
[02:08:33.445 --> 02:08:37.248]  Getting back to the hunger for Americana, I've told the story 20 times, I shouldn't tell it again, but...
[02:08:38.041 --> 02:08:39.502]  I got invited to a major film festival.
[02:08:39.823 --> 02:08:40.323]  Couldn't go.
[02:08:40.343 --> 02:08:41.064]  Senator representative.
[02:08:41.504 --> 02:08:48.029]  And it was just all, we're being funded to shock people and to depress people and to create a revolution and to overthrow things.
[02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:52.213]  Well, I don't need to go to a conference to learn that with filmmakers and how they're getting money.
[02:08:52.433 --> 02:08:53.033]  You can see it.
[02:08:53.414 --> 02:09:02.341]  But the hunger for Americana, the hunger for just decency, the hunger for just being normal and human is so powerful right now.
[02:09:02.721 --> 02:09:04.723]  And everything that's number one is that.
[02:09:05.103 --> 02:09:07.005]  Well, we're not just saying we're that now.
[02:09:07.305 --> 02:09:08.626]  I've been that since I was born.
[02:09:08.866 --> 02:09:12.049]  And most people in this country want that and are that as well, my friend.
[02:09:13.130 --> 02:09:15.692]  Yeah, and you know, if you look to Hollywood...
[02:09:17.418 --> 02:09:24.864]  I haven't watched a major Hollywood film in probably six months and like my entire life is Hollywood films.
[02:09:25.164 --> 02:09:35.572]  That's I watched nothing but movies for you know as I was growing up and when there was free time when I was a grown-up when I was an adult I was watching movies.
[02:09:36.493 --> 02:09:42.097]  I haven't watched a film in six months and it's there's there's nothing good coming out of there.
[02:09:42.418 --> 02:09:44.739]  It's all social justice warrior stuff.
[02:09:44.820 --> 02:09:46.061]  It's all these
[02:09:48.042 --> 02:09:56.368]  narrative infused, you know, they're trying to do some sort of parody of either Trump or something like that.
[02:09:56.408 --> 02:10:03.894]  And then on top of that, you have all of these actors, that people pay to watch them.
[02:10:04.574 --> 02:10:11.459]  And then all they want to do is say anti Trump stuff, or, you know, go up on stage and say f Trump at the at the award ceremonies.
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:12.200]  And it's,
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:24.391]  I think Hollywood is starting to realize how bad their PR is right now, but I think they're going to continue to do it because the money is going to continue to flow in from other sources.
[02:10:24.711 --> 02:10:33.420]  The NFL's down 40% in the last three years with all their hate America garbage, and I was reading today Disney's profit is way down.
[02:10:33.460 --> 02:10:34.220]  They just laid off 60%
[02:10:37.844 --> 02:10:41.646]  Now that Forbes has got PR pieces out about how they're doing great, but I have an article right here in my study.
[02:10:42.046 --> 02:10:44.107]  They're down 60 percent.
[02:10:44.167 --> 02:10:48.609]  They just laid off 60 percent of their people in a whole division today.
[02:10:49.829 --> 02:10:52.891]  Well, and they've ruined Star Wars like four times now.
[02:10:53.131 --> 02:10:57.973]  So I don't know.
[02:11:00.086 --> 02:11:05.510]  How we fix this because because like I said, all of the money is flowing in from external sources.
[02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:07.391]  It's not coming in from the box offices.
[02:11:08.211 --> 02:11:10.773]  I mean, there's actually China's the biggest fund.
[02:11:10.793 --> 02:11:11.694]  Yeah, they are.
[02:11:12.154 --> 02:11:12.954]  They're propping it up.
[02:11:13.995 --> 02:11:15.756]  Yeah, all of these.
[02:11:15.916 --> 02:11:29.425]  I think something that that Trump has done just flawlessly in the last three years is just shown how much everything is up is a propped up.
[02:11:30.385 --> 02:11:34.647]  And it's a cardboard cutout of what we all thought it was.
[02:11:34.707 --> 02:11:37.768]  You know, Hollywood is just a cardboard cutout and there's nothing behind it.
[02:11:38.949 --> 02:11:42.950]  All of these politicians and the news media as well.
[02:11:43.050 --> 02:11:49.893]  I mean, this is something funny that I notice is you go to like, let's say Newsweek.
[02:11:50.033 --> 02:11:52.534]  You go to Newsweek and you go to their Twitter account.
[02:11:52.934 --> 02:11:54.475]  They've got like a million followers.
[02:11:55.237 --> 02:11:59.121]  And they get like three retweets on every article they put out.
[02:11:59.381 --> 02:12:02.444]  There's absolutely no one cares about them.
[02:12:02.464 --> 02:12:03.705]  They're completely irrelevant.
[02:12:04.045 --> 02:12:06.567]  But they continue to be in the news.
[02:12:06.627 --> 02:12:11.432]  They continue to put out things because they're funded by these outside sources.
[02:12:12.085 --> 02:12:17.827]  And just like the old Soviet Union, though, at a certain point, everybody knows whatever you're being told, it's the opposite.
[02:12:17.867 --> 02:12:23.810]  Like the Chinese government said last week, oh, we're not going to move into Hong Kong for the next few months.
[02:12:24.130 --> 02:12:24.630]  Don't worry.
[02:12:24.650 --> 02:12:27.351]  I said, OK, get our people out of there on Monday.
[02:12:27.551 --> 02:12:28.952]  I said, get out, get out.
[02:12:28.992 --> 02:12:29.832]  They're about to invade.
[02:12:29.852 --> 02:12:31.152]  And then they invaded yesterday.
[02:12:31.653 --> 02:12:37.755]  I mean, just, you know, with commies and these decepticons, they cannot tell the truth, even when the truth serves them better.
[02:12:38.917 --> 02:12:42.598]  No, and anything that they do tell, it's something they're doing.
[02:12:43.279 --> 02:12:50.901]  It seems like a cliche, and I really wish it wasn't true, but the left always projects.
[02:12:51.141 --> 02:12:53.702]  When they call you a racist, they're doing racist stuff.
[02:12:54.002 --> 02:12:56.203]  When they call you a sexist, they're doing sexist stuff.
[02:12:56.523 --> 02:12:58.944]  When they call you a pedophile, they're doing pedophile stuff.
[02:13:00.763 --> 02:13:03.845]  I wish it wasn't true, but it rings true every single time.
[02:13:03.885 --> 02:13:08.327]  They say, hey, you guys are dangerous and violent over at Infowars.
[02:13:08.647 --> 02:13:11.048]  And then they go beat people in the streets of Portland.
[02:13:11.509 --> 02:13:15.651]  And they go attack people in the streets of D.C.
[02:13:15.871 --> 02:13:18.352]  or any place, Berkeley.
[02:13:18.372 --> 02:13:21.254]  You know, everything is projection.
[02:13:22.294 --> 02:13:25.656]  And all you have to do is look at what they say to know exactly what they're doing.
[02:13:29.145 --> 02:13:43.751]  And since I mentioned this earlier, here is Jennifer Rubin again on MSNBC saying, drive us into submission, go after all the Trump supporters, burn down, I mean she goes on for five minutes, you know, literally burn them down, destroy them.
[02:13:44.512 --> 02:13:47.453]  And she's not talking about metaphorically, here it is.
[02:13:49.038 --> 02:13:53.062]  It's not only that Trump has to lose, but that all his enablers have to lose.
[02:13:54.083 --> 02:13:57.447]  We have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[02:13:58.187 --> 02:14:05.174]  We have to level them, because if there are survivors, if there are people who weathered this storm, they will do it again.
[02:14:05.194 --> 02:14:09.358]  They will take this as confirmation that, hey, it just pays to ride the waves.
[02:14:09.438 --> 02:14:10.920]  Look at me, I've made it through.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:12.942]  And so up and down the ticket,
[02:14:13.382 --> 02:14:15.183]  Federal, state, local offices.
[02:14:15.223 --> 02:14:16.844]  The country has to repudiate this.
[02:14:17.284 --> 02:14:18.905]  It is not a normal administration.
[02:14:18.945 --> 02:14:23.148]  And when these people say, oh, you can't criticize us, it will deter public service.
[02:14:23.748 --> 02:14:29.572]  It will deter people who are liars, who are enablers, who are really bad people.
[02:14:29.592 --> 02:14:30.632]  Look at these tyrants.
[02:14:31.373 --> 02:14:32.053]  All nodding.
[02:14:32.073 --> 02:14:32.053]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[02:14:33.274 --> 02:14:36.196]  And just so satisfied.
[02:14:36.496 --> 02:14:37.056]  Level them.
[02:14:37.116 --> 02:14:37.917]  Knock them down.
[02:14:38.837 --> 02:14:40.038]  Drag them into submission.
[02:14:40.558 --> 02:14:41.499]  That's why we have
[02:14:42.591 --> 02:14:44.912]  BAN.VIDEO we've launched with all of our videos.
[02:14:44.932 --> 02:14:46.012]  Easy to search right there.

[02:14:56.396 --> 02:14:58.557]  So you can, hey, here's a place that won't disappear tomorrow.
[02:14:58.777 --> 02:15:00.738]  Here's a place where you can post memes and share memes.
[02:15:01.018 --> 02:15:02.058]  And it's going to get bigger and bigger.
[02:15:02.078 --> 02:15:02.778]  It's very exciting.
[02:15:02.838 --> 02:15:03.939]  Please share it.
[02:15:04.799 --> 02:15:05.921]  Every way you can.
[02:15:06.301 --> 02:15:08.644]  Please share it via your email, your text message, your word of mouth.
[02:15:08.664 --> 02:15:09.926]  They can't stop you there next.
[02:15:10.286 --> 02:15:11.908]  But you know, Carb-A-Duncan, now WhatsApp.
[02:15:12.609 --> 02:15:20.479]  Just three months ago, CNN said, well, we're seeing if Jones is using WhatsApp that Facebook owns to communicate via private text message.
[02:15:20.779 --> 02:15:21.940]  If he's on there, we'll ban him.
[02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:30.603]  And I wasn't on there, but they went around and banned now millions of people, and they're blocking what you can share and what you can say on there in live time.
[02:15:30.863 --> 02:15:33.187]  And the word is they were blocking Meme World last week.
[02:15:33.487 --> 02:15:34.189]  So was Twitter.
[02:15:34.449 --> 02:15:35.330]  Is that still happening?
[02:15:36.389 --> 02:15:38.229]  Uh, they have stopped doing that now.
[02:15:38.329 --> 02:15:47.011]  I've gotten word that it's no longer being banned, and my Facebook page is up for the site, and it's able to share.
[02:15:47.111 --> 02:15:49.031]  So, we'll see how long that lasts.
[02:16:05.689 --> 02:16:15.374]  I traveled from California to Texas, and it's like a three-day drive, especially if you're not... I had a trailer behind me, so I can't go really fast.
[02:16:15.394 --> 02:16:19.297]  So I'm driving, and I love God's country, and it's beautiful.
[02:16:19.377 --> 02:16:21.118]  But being humans, we get tired.
[02:16:21.398 --> 02:16:25.700]  And even just after four hours of driving, and I'm starting to get tired, and I remembered.
[02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:27.921]  I said, oh, I have a pack of TurboForce.
[02:16:28.061 --> 02:16:34.125]  So I reached into my console in my vehicle, and I took out the TurboForce, and I stopped at a gas station.
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:36.640]  And I got me some orange juice.
[02:16:37.421 --> 02:16:38.681]  It wasn't quite this big.
[02:16:39.481 --> 02:16:49.224]  The typical size is a little bit smaller, but and I'll put like half the packet of the Turbo Force in it because the stuff is so great and so wonderful it gets you going.
[02:16:49.704 --> 02:16:53.185]  But there's quite a bit in this one, so I'm gonna put the whole thing in this one.
[02:16:54.145 --> 02:16:58.346]  And when I was driving from California to Texas,
[02:16:59.545 --> 02:17:03.247]  I took the Turbo Force and I put it in orange juice.
[02:17:03.267 --> 02:17:04.387]  And I took it and I shook it up.
[02:17:06.248 --> 02:17:10.230]  Hear that?
[02:17:10.650 --> 02:17:11.390]  Get in there real good.
[02:17:11.410 --> 02:17:13.751]  And you know what's amazing?
[02:17:13.811 --> 02:17:16.072]  It actually heightens the taste.
[02:17:16.252 --> 02:17:17.793]  I mean, I really like it.
[02:17:17.813 --> 02:17:23.875]  I mean, I'm a big fan of orange juice already, but... Yeah.
[02:17:25.056 --> 02:17:27.137]  I mean, it's really good.
[02:17:27.357 --> 02:17:27.657]  Let me see.
[02:17:29.309 --> 02:17:31.477]  Mmm.
[02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:32.721]  Mmm.
[02:17:32.762 --> 02:17:32.902]  Wow.
[02:17:34.662 --> 02:17:37.144]  It's like energy immediately.
[02:17:37.344 --> 02:17:40.687]  The experience with Turboforce in orange juice is so different.
[02:17:40.708 --> 02:17:44.811]  A lot of people just take it and put it in water and they never thought about putting it in orange juice.
[02:17:44.911 --> 02:17:45.732]  It's completely different.
[02:17:45.872 --> 02:17:48.595]  So the orange juice, it like intensifies the taste.
[02:17:48.655 --> 02:17:49.135]  But you know what?
[02:17:49.295 --> 02:17:51.697]  I'm not talking about it just so people will buy it.
[02:17:51.797 --> 02:17:53.959]  I'm talking about it because it's my personal experience.
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:55.641]  It's like it brightens the orange juice up.
[02:17:55.721 --> 02:17:56.762]  I can't really explain it.
[02:17:56.802 --> 02:17:59.384]  You have to buy it and try it yourself to understand.
[02:17:59.404 --> 02:18:00.145]  If you have a package
[02:18:00.185 --> 02:18:00.625]  We're good to
[02:18:16.795 --> 02:18:17.316]  Pass out.
[02:18:17.476 --> 02:18:22.581]  And you know, I've had so many people come up to me and say, Will, I tried it with the orange juice and I love it.
[02:18:22.741 --> 02:18:25.984]  And with the TurboForce, I mean, it's like the missing ingredient.
[02:18:26.044 --> 02:18:29.427]  I mean, seriously, TurboForce is the missing ingredient in the orange juice.
[02:18:29.587 --> 02:18:31.349]  And I'm addicted to it.
[02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:34.873]  The TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:18:36.002 --> 02:18:38.003]  Most of the time, they keep it on sale.
[02:18:38.383 --> 02:18:41.004]  And I'm like, how are they able to do that?
[02:18:41.064 --> 02:18:42.905]  They keep it on sale for so long.
[02:18:43.045 --> 02:18:53.409]  And I think, I've never been told this, but I think the main reason why they keep it on sale and they keep the price so low is that so people will try it and you will be amazed.
[02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:54.889]  So get the Turbo Force today.
[02:18:54.969 --> 02:18:55.790]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:03.243 --> 02:19:18.828]  Controlling the Human Mind, one of the most important books that I've ever written, deals with the whole concept of mind effects, mind control, going back to the historical perspective as well, as sort of the ways in which we might be able to enhance our performance.
[02:19:18.888 --> 02:19:22.189]  One of my classics, all of my books and videos are available.
[02:19:22.589 --> 02:19:25.211]  At the InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:19:25.251 --> 02:19:30.356]  That's a place to go, make copies of those videos, get them out to your friends, but support the InfoWars.
[02:19:30.376 --> 02:19:41.284]  This is an opportunity to not just get good information, well documented, over 1,350 footnotes in those four books, and the videos are the same quality of good information.
[02:19:41.345 --> 02:19:42.926]  Most important one out right now,
[02:19:43.406 --> 02:19:44.706]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:29.377 --> 02:20:33.180]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:33.760]  And believe it,
[02:20:50.768 --> 02:21:03.852]  The world is hungry for liberty, and once again, the West, the United Kingdom, the United States, just as we saw in World War I and World War II, is leading the way out of tyranny against the Chai Khans, the corrupt EU.
[02:21:04.472 --> 02:21:06.492]  History doesn't just rhyme, it repeats.
[02:21:06.572 --> 02:21:11.694]  The question is, which side will Russia get with in this major political realignment?
[02:21:12.154 --> 02:21:18.616]  When the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II, for the first time in 400 years suspended Parliament,
[02:21:19.611 --> 02:21:24.393]  It wasn't because a king or a queen wanted to ignore the will of the people.
[02:21:25.793 --> 02:21:36.216]  It was because the people had voted to leave an unelected tyranny almost four years ago and had their demands ignored and scuttled.
[02:21:36.977 --> 02:21:41.098]  And thanks to Lord Christopher Monckton and Nigel Farage at the heart of this movement, at Brexit,
[02:21:42.523 --> 02:21:46.384]  We now see her doing the right thing, and this has sent shockwaves.
[02:21:46.404 --> 02:21:51.626]  This is just like the realignment in World War II and Bretton Woods that came after it, in my humble opinion.
[02:21:51.646 --> 02:22:03.009]  Lord Christopher Monk has been the top advisor to Margaret Thatcher, author, the preeminent scientist and expert working with other scientists around the world, proving man-made global warming is a fraud and a globalist takeover.
[02:22:03.049 --> 02:22:07.230]  He has What's Up with that website and, of course, his science and public policy site.
[02:22:07.590 --> 02:22:10.291]  But I wanted to get him on to correct me if I'm wrong
[02:22:11.764 --> 02:22:17.489]  That you cannot underestimate how seismic this is, what it really symbolizes.
[02:22:17.629 --> 02:22:20.732]  India going into Kashmir, which the Islamists have been taking.
[02:22:20.792 --> 02:22:21.612]  China's been moving in.
[02:22:21.672 --> 02:22:22.613]  That's a proxy war.
[02:22:23.134 --> 02:22:24.495]  China moving into Hong Kong.
[02:22:25.375 --> 02:22:32.682]  I mean, the world is going into the type of constellations, the type of alignments that we saw before World War I and World War II.
[02:22:33.042 --> 02:22:34.183]  Am I right in saying that?
[02:22:34.203 --> 02:22:37.786]  Are we not seeing the classic alignments line up again, Lord Monckton?
[02:22:39.133 --> 02:22:42.156]  What is happening is that, let's take Hong Kong first of all.
[02:22:42.256 --> 02:22:52.446]  Yes, the people of Hong Kong were guaranteed certain rights under the agreement between China and Britain over the handover of Hong Kong.
[02:22:52.867 --> 02:22:56.530]  In my view, we shouldn't have handed it over to that particular regime.
[02:22:56.811 --> 02:23:01.876]  We didn't have to, there was no obligation to, but we decided to, unfortunately.
[02:23:02.709 --> 02:23:11.254]  And the people of Hong Kong are now missing the freedoms they had under British rule, which was a great deal freer than Chinese rule.
[02:23:11.934 --> 02:23:27.203]  And in the United Kingdom, where we have been struggling for 40 years to break free from the tyranny by Clark, which is the European Union, Boris Johnson, who is our very new Prime Minister, has decided, and rightly,
[02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:49.181]  That we can no longer allow Parliament to get in the way of the people's will as expressed in an overwhelming referendum vote by a clear majority of one and three quarter million three or four years ago by which we voted to leave the tyranny by clerk and once again get our democracy back.
[02:23:49.561 --> 02:23:50.782]  That's what we voted for.
[02:23:51.222 --> 02:23:52.843]  Parliament wasn't going to let us.
[02:23:53.343 --> 02:23:54.604]  And so what Boris has done
[02:23:55.507 --> 02:24:01.591]  Is to say, all right, we're going to give Parliament enough time to debate this, but not enough to wreck it.
[02:24:02.171 --> 02:24:20.764]  And of course, all of the smelly socks, all the people who are trying to deny us democracy, are rushing to the courts in Scotland, in Ireland, and in London, all of them demanding that the Queen's decision to prorogue Parliament should be set aside by the mere courts.
[02:24:21.264 --> 02:24:28.073]  Well, the mere courts are going to find that they have no power to interfere with Her Majesty's prerogative.
[02:24:28.533 --> 02:24:35.002]  She has decided to take the advice of her Prime Minister, as she is entitled and indeed constitutionally bound to do.
[02:24:35.720 --> 02:24:44.728]  That therefore she has decided that Parliament will be prorogued for slightly longer, only about a week longer than it's normally prorogued for.
[02:24:44.788 --> 02:24:45.469]  It's not new.
[02:24:45.549 --> 02:24:47.711]  It's not the first time in 400 years.
[02:24:47.991 --> 02:24:49.392]  This happens every year.
[02:24:49.452 --> 02:24:51.094]  In fact, the present Parliament
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:59.027]  ...has gone on for far longer than any Parliament in the last 400 years, so it's appropriate that it should be prorogued.
[02:24:59.107 --> 02:25:00.008]  Let me just interrupt.
[02:25:00.108 --> 02:25:01.750]  I know you're the Parliamentary expert.
[02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:04.132]  I'm not about to disagree with you, but correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:25:04.673 --> 02:25:07.075]  Something this dramatic, though, hasn't happened in 400.
[02:25:07.195 --> 02:25:15.704]  Clearly, when the King of England told Neville Chamberlain to step down and put Winston Churchill in, that was another move saying, look, this Parliament
[02:25:16.064 --> 02:25:17.126]  Has been siding with Hitler.
[02:25:17.166 --> 02:25:17.567]  You're done.
[02:25:17.607 --> 02:25:18.448]  You're a bunch of wimps.
[02:25:18.849 --> 02:25:19.851]  Winston Churchill's in.
[02:25:20.071 --> 02:25:24.379]  So wouldn't that be another dramatic time that something similar in the same family has happened?
[02:25:25.302 --> 02:25:33.368]  Well, the first thing to realise is that it is at the Prime Minister's instigation and not at the monarch's instigation that this prorogation has happened.
[02:25:33.749 --> 02:25:48.320]  It's an entirely normal constitutional procedure where the Prime Minister goes to see the Queen with the leader of the Commons, in this case the wonderful Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of my neighbours down here.
[02:25:49.060 --> 02:26:01.588]  And they said, look, we want to prorogue Parliament, have a new Parliament, which will start on October the 14th, which is two clear weeks, two and a half clear weeks, before Halloween, the day on which we actually leave.
[02:26:01.948 --> 02:26:05.130]  And in any case, there's another two weeks before Parliament is prorogued.
[02:26:05.170 --> 02:26:07.472]  So there's plenty of time for Parliament.
[02:26:07.592 --> 02:26:08.592]  We'll get to this next segment.
[02:26:08.612 --> 02:26:09.193]  You're the expert.
[02:26:09.233 --> 02:26:09.813]  Boil it down, though.
[02:26:09.873 --> 02:26:17.258]  Am I right that this is a huge seismic shift, though, looking like we will get a good, clean Brexit and a huge defeat to the EU tyranny?
[02:26:18.482 --> 02:26:23.567]  Well, the EU tyranny won't like what's happened, and those who support it certainly don't like what's happened.
[02:26:23.607 --> 02:26:29.754]  There are demonstrations, there's a lot of screaming, the BBC is wetting itself, taking only one side, of course.
[02:26:30.154 --> 02:26:33.037]  But what has happened is entirely constitutionally proper.
[02:26:33.397 --> 02:26:39.464]  The courts have no power to intervene, to tell Her Majesty she should not prorogue Parliament.
[02:26:39.884 --> 02:26:43.248]  And therefore, I suspect that Boris will get away with that.
[02:26:43.648 --> 02:26:48.834]  Parliament still has plenty of time, though, to try to bring forward a wrecking bill.
[02:26:49.134 --> 02:26:55.201]  And that's the first thing that Oliver Leftwing and various other characters like that are going to try.
[02:26:55.281 --> 02:26:58.204]  He was on the television today saying he was going to do that.
[02:26:58.624 --> 02:27:08.130]  So, this is by no means a done deal yet, but what you can see very clearly is that Boris Johnson speaks for Britain, as President Trump has recently said.
[02:27:08.411 --> 02:27:12.333]  Boris Johnson loves this country very much, as of course does Donald Trump.
[02:27:12.373 --> 02:27:25.602]  He's a great admirer of Britain, and he sees in Boris Johnson somebody who stands up for this country, and for the majority of the people of this country, that voted to leave the tyranny by Clerk, and once again be an independent nation.
[02:27:26.062 --> 02:27:28.524]  Boris now speaks for the people of Britain.
[02:27:28.924 --> 02:27:34.508]  He has gambled a lot by taking this brave move, but I think that gamble is going to pay off.
[02:27:34.548 --> 02:27:35.749]  He's going to be successful.
[02:27:36.910 --> 02:27:43.975]  And he's delivering on what he said he would do, and Paul Watson obviously works for these guys, some behind the scenes.
[02:27:44.015 --> 02:27:52.781]  He tells me that Nigel Farage really is the, not to lessen Boris Johnson, but he's really one of the chief advisors to Johnson, and that's got the system really scared.
[02:27:53.974 --> 02:28:15.420]  Well, certainly, Nigel, you see, having set up his own Brexit Party, is really saying to Boris, look, if you don't deliver Brexit by the due date, if you're forced into any kind of a general election before you've managed to leave the European Union, then we and the Brexit Party are going to be standing not with you, but against you.
[02:28:16.152 --> 02:28:24.378]  So Boris is under a lot of pressure to do what Theresa May faffed around not doing and get us out of the European Union.
[02:28:24.659 --> 02:28:31.464]  The technique that he's using behind the scenes and of course Sir Oliver Leftwing and people like that haven't noticed yet.
[02:28:32.145 --> 02:28:33.525]  Is in fact a very clever one.
[02:28:33.865 --> 02:28:37.146]  What he's doing is a series of what are called micro-deals.
[02:28:37.346 --> 02:28:38.007]  Hold on, stay there.
[02:28:38.027 --> 02:28:38.747]  We've got to go to break.
[02:28:39.167 --> 02:28:40.547]  This is history happening.
[02:28:40.947 --> 02:28:47.009]  From, you know, UKIP and now the Brexit Party, nothing 20 years ago, to the dominant growing party in Europe, the UK.
[02:28:47.289 --> 02:28:50.150]  This is truly liberty marching on, a human awakening.
[02:28:50.430 --> 02:28:51.610]  It's a very beautiful time.
[02:28:51.890 --> 02:28:53.330]  Lord Monckton is our guest.
[02:28:53.651 --> 02:28:58.972]  We'll come right back with him on the other side of this quick break to get into what's happening behind the scenes.
[02:29:08.454 --> 02:29:11.818]  We have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[02:29:12.539 --> 02:29:19.667]  We have to level them, because if there are survivors, if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.
[02:29:19.707 --> 02:29:28.697]  Jennifer Rubin, a senior writer at the Washington Post, said that if conservatives and Trump supporters can weather the storm of lawsuits, harassment,
[02:29:29.378 --> 02:29:29.919]  Death threats.
[02:29:29.999 --> 02:29:32.421]  We need to just physically burn them down.
[02:29:32.601 --> 02:29:34.502]  She says there must be no survivors.
[02:29:34.742 --> 02:29:36.124]  What do you think InfoWars is?
[02:29:36.284 --> 02:29:37.565]  What do you think we're going through?
[02:29:37.585 --> 02:29:38.446]  You're the target, though.
[02:29:38.566 --> 02:29:41.148]  But I've dared to challenge their Queen Hillary.
[02:29:41.528 --> 02:29:43.950]  I dared to mobilize the population.
[02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:45.571]  You dared to mobilize the population.
[02:29:45.671 --> 02:29:46.392]  And we're here.
[02:29:46.532 --> 02:29:49.194]  And we have energized the core of the nation.
[02:29:49.254 --> 02:29:50.395]  Black, white, old, young.
[02:29:50.515 --> 02:29:52.437]  And people don't buy the propaganda anymore.
[02:29:52.617 --> 02:29:59.807]  I have so many people walk up to me and they say, you know, I didn't even used to be a fan of yours till I heard them lie about you and I had to go hear what you were saying to find out why they were after you.
[02:29:59.827 --> 02:30:01.770]  And man, you've got an amazing broadcast.
[02:30:03.312 --> 02:30:05.214]  I'm shaking more hands than I've ever shook.
[02:30:06.616 --> 02:30:08.799]  I'm getting more support on the ground.
[02:30:09.735 --> 02:30:13.957]  But not financial, because it's only a core audience that actually buys the products.
[02:30:13.977 --> 02:30:21.762]  We're doing something very special, and I can tell you, this special is the very best special we've ever done, particularly with this type of sale.
[02:30:21.782 --> 02:30:23.743]  It's a type of sale we've never engaged in.
[02:30:23.843 --> 02:30:31.248]  But DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10, and everything else you need for your telomeres, your cells, energy, it's the base you need for everything.
[02:30:31.528 --> 02:30:33.569]  If you don't have this, no amount of energy drink's gonna help.
[02:30:33.849 --> 02:30:35.010]  It's the fount of it all.
[02:30:35.130 --> 02:30:39.354]  It's the very best, you name it, nootropic, antioxidant for your cells.
[02:30:39.474 --> 02:30:42.316]  It's just, and this has got a bunch of patented stuff you can make claims on.
[02:30:42.456 --> 02:30:43.757]  It's unbelievable.
[02:30:43.937 --> 02:30:44.618]  98% reviews.
[02:30:44.658 --> 02:30:45.419]  Memphoreshore.com.
[02:30:45.439 --> 02:30:46.119]  Let me go further.
[02:30:46.279 --> 02:30:48.621]  Super Mel Vitality is our second bestseller.
[02:30:48.821 --> 02:30:51.624]  I don't need to sit there and tell you how great it is.
[02:30:51.724 --> 02:30:56.848]  Cold-pressed herbs, wild harvested, so that they keep their psycho active.
[02:30:56.948 --> 02:30:58.129]  I mean, it's for the brain, everything.
[02:30:58.249 --> 02:30:59.410]  Libido, energy, stamina.
[02:30:59.550 --> 02:31:01.432]  Carnivore, digestive enzymes.
[02:31:02.802 --> 02:31:07.664]  This is a product that's been popular, people that know what they're doing, but overall not a popular product.
[02:31:08.064 --> 02:31:10.525]  I'm not going to get into what these expensive enzymes do.
[02:31:10.645 --> 02:31:13.886]  They don't just help you break down fat or break down protein in the gut.
[02:31:14.026 --> 02:31:15.266]  It does it in the intestines.
[02:31:15.386 --> 02:31:20.368]  If you want to flush out the meat you've been eating and you want to really get healthy, this is amazing.
[02:31:20.428 --> 02:31:21.148]  It's next level.
[02:31:21.268 --> 02:31:22.309]  And so guess what I'm doing?

[02:32:02.856 --> 02:32:08.881]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.
[02:32:15.163 --> 02:32:17.045]  But we can't let them get away with it.

[02:32:41.806 --> 02:32:49.972]  They're only printing a limited supply of these t-shirts, so make sure you get yours right now at InfoWarsStore.com before they sell out.
[02:32:50.513 --> 02:32:53.174]  God bless America, and God bless InfoWars.
[02:32:53.195 --> 02:32:57.518]  Flawless victory.
[02:33:05.564 --> 02:33:08.246]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.987 --> 02:33:18.969]  Waging, waging war on corruption.
[02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:21.491]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:38.084 --> 02:33:45.428]  What would you call this period the world's in with nationalism exploding, Germany with nationalists set to take over?
[02:33:58.737 --> 02:34:01.279]  It's happening everywhere, but they're striking back with censorship.
[02:34:01.620 --> 02:34:03.261]  They're striking back with leftist violence.
[02:34:04.822 --> 02:34:08.405]  I mean, I agree, we're not out of the woods yet, but seeing this huge awakening, what would you call this?
[02:34:08.465 --> 02:34:08.846]  Period?
[02:34:09.506 --> 02:34:09.767]  And then...
[02:34:11.681 --> 02:34:13.642]  Well, first, let's get to what you were trying to hit before the break.
[02:34:14.323 --> 02:34:15.704]  The real power behind the throne.
[02:34:15.724 --> 02:34:17.085]  We're not sycophantically talking about it.
[02:34:17.485 --> 02:34:18.005]  It's true.
[02:34:18.305 --> 02:34:18.766]  It's admitted.
[02:34:18.826 --> 02:34:24.630]  Nigel Farage and his Brigsit party keeping Boris Johnson very, very honest.
[02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:28.152]  I've got headlines here about Boris Johnson.
[02:34:28.192 --> 02:34:29.173]  Does it turn out to be a buffoon?
[02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:30.694]  He turns out to be a deadly tactician.
[02:34:30.734 --> 02:34:34.556]  Well, there's a really deadly tactician behind this named Nigel Farage.
[02:34:34.576 --> 02:34:36.397]  And, of course, you're involved in that as well.
[02:34:36.818 --> 02:34:41.381]  We're not saying that from a bragging position, but you can give us the real inside intel globally right now.
[02:34:41.761 --> 02:34:42.301]  On what's happening.
[02:34:43.662 --> 02:34:47.084]  Let's start, just first of all, with what Boris is going to do to get Brexit.
[02:34:47.104 --> 02:34:52.306]  Then I'll move on to Nigel Farage, then we'll move on a bit around the world, because the point you're making is a very important one.
[02:34:53.187 --> 02:34:55.688]  I call this age the New Enlightenment.
[02:34:56.337 --> 02:35:03.366]  We had the Age of Enlightenment, then came the Age of Communism, Fascism and Socialism, various kinds of totalitarianism.
[02:35:03.887 --> 02:35:13.219]  Now, the people who love democracy in Hong Kong, in Germany, in Britain, in Italy, in many parts of the world, and of course America, having elected Donald Trump.
[02:35:13.892 --> 02:35:22.924]  Now the people are rising up against those who would impose a global socialist, communist, fascist tyranny upon us.
[02:35:23.304 --> 02:35:29.172]  And of course these words socialist, communist, fascist, they sound extreme, but they are unfortunately realistic.
[02:35:29.693 --> 02:35:31.315]  Let's start with Boris Johnson then.
[02:35:31.635 --> 02:35:31.936]  Boris?
[02:35:32.916 --> 02:35:44.885]  ...is doing a series of micro-deals on all the areas of trade which would be disrupted if we left the European Union on the 31st of October, the due date, without a trade deal.
[02:35:45.660 --> 02:35:48.442]  Such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture.
[02:35:48.482 --> 02:35:49.602]  These are two of the big ones.
[02:35:49.923 --> 02:35:51.524]  Motor manufacture is another.
[02:35:52.144 --> 02:35:57.887]  And these areas which could prove sensitive if we didn't make individual temporary arrangements.
[02:35:58.168 --> 02:36:01.910]  He is making sure that those individual temporary arrangements are in place.
[02:36:02.270 --> 02:36:09.334]  So that if we leave without a comprehensive trade deal, and that's what the normal rules of leaving the European Union would expect.
[02:36:09.354 --> 02:36:13.657]  You leave without a comprehensive deal and then once you're out, you negotiate it.
[02:36:14.261 --> 02:36:28.751]  And all that Boris is doing is putting things in place so that if we leave without a comprehensive deal, we do not leave with dislocation and bankruptcy for businesses and disruption of trade and queues of lorries halfway from London to Dover.
[02:36:29.091 --> 02:36:36.416]  Those things are not going to happen because the government under Boris Johnson is making very clear and very sure that they won't happen.
[02:36:37.012 --> 02:36:42.714]  So don't worry about a no-deal Brexit being somehow hugely disruptive.
[02:36:43.034 --> 02:36:52.238]  It won't be, because everything that might be disruptive is being dealt with behind the scenes very quickly, very efficiently by Boris and his team.
[02:36:53.030 --> 02:37:07.307]  Now we come to Nigel Farage, and Farage is putting proper pressure on Boris, and for once also he's now looking at a wider issue than just the question of leaving the European dictatorship.
[02:37:07.547 --> 02:37:11.993]  Because one of the things that's become apparent to you and to him and to me, Alex,
[02:37:13.229 --> 02:37:25.465]  ...is that if we're going to keep democracy in any recognisable sense at all, there are various steps we're going to have to take to take the battle right to the front line where the other side are.
[02:37:25.745 --> 02:37:30.752]  For instance, in the universities, where now there is a denial of freedom of speech.
[02:37:31.352 --> 02:37:45.001]  We're going to have to say to those universities, you either permit freedom of speech, you permit both sides to be heard on questions such as climate change, on whether Britain leaves the EU, on whether Mr Trump is a good thing or a bad one.
[02:37:45.422 --> 02:37:54.027]  You allow both sides to be heard or we will take your charter, your funding and your recognition as a university away.
[02:37:54.147 --> 02:37:57.510]  And Trump taking your leave has signed an executive order starting just that.
[02:37:57.910 --> 02:37:58.191]  Exactly that.
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:11.341]  Well, that's right.
[02:38:11.862 --> 02:38:16.608]  The great thing being Irish, I knew that if I threw myself to the ground I wouldn't miss, so all was well.
[02:38:16.888 --> 02:38:28.984]  But it did make sure that they had to let me back into the conference, and then I produced a report of what they were really up to at that conference, which we put up at whatsupwiththat.com, and that was the top
[02:38:29.542 --> 02:38:41.505]  posting out of 500,000 postings on all subjects that day of all the blog posts from Wordpress, which manages most of the blog posts around the world, because so popular was it.
[02:38:41.805 --> 02:38:50.867]  I was the only journalist who actually went in there, found out what was really going on and reported it, rather than simply blowing sunshine up the backsides of the UN.
[02:38:51.307 --> 02:39:02.096]  There's a picture of me now, as you can see, grinning from ear to ear as I leap happily out of the plane and head rapidly towards the ground in the Drakensberg mountains of South Africa.
[02:39:02.416 --> 02:39:05.419]  It was a wonderful moment, and what a beautiful country it is.
[02:39:05.979 --> 02:39:07.721]  So, we are fighting, Alex.
[02:39:08.181 --> 02:39:15.167]  Against this tide of, you can call it communism, fascism, socialism, totalitarianism, or to use the ancient Chinese term, legalism.
[02:39:15.187 --> 02:39:18.570]  It's centralized corporate totalitarianism, allied with the Chai Koms.
[02:39:18.610 --> 02:39:30.801]  And it's becoming very evident that the Chai Koms are the great driving engine and the force to which all these mega-corporations and the Googles of the world are using for the funding of Hollywood, for the espionage.
[02:39:31.202 --> 02:39:34.925]  And Trump and others are starting to take the gloves off, recognizing the espionage.
[02:39:35.970 --> 02:39:45.939]  Well, China is indeed in everywhere, spying through its computers, through its Huawei, through its G5, all these things.
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:47.861]  They are watching us very closely.
[02:39:48.101 --> 02:39:51.204]  We're not watching them anything like as closely as we should.
[02:39:51.665 --> 02:39:53.907]  Of course, Mr Obama, a fellow communist,
[02:39:54.347 --> 02:40:00.109]  Exempted them from any obligation in China to comply with any of the provisions of the Paris Treaty.
[02:40:00.509 --> 02:40:07.632]  So not only do they pay lousy wages, do they not pay proper pensions, they don't pay proper health care, they don't have proper social care.
[02:40:07.952 --> 02:40:11.193]  So labour is a great deal cheaper for those four reasons already.
[02:40:11.533 --> 02:40:22.377]  But now we charge our businesses here and in America, but five or six times the price we would have charged for electricity were it not for the Global Wallet scam.
[02:40:23.138 --> 02:40:28.664]  It totally is possible for us to do business, in a competitive sense, against China worldwide.
[02:40:29.145 --> 02:40:33.710]  And these economic consequences of this global warming stupidity should not be forgotten.
[02:40:33.970 --> 02:40:41.099]  All of this is an attempt by the tyrants to bankrupt the West, because if the West goes, tyranny is easier to enforce worldwide.
[02:40:42.109 --> 02:40:45.832]  Now, Christopher, let me just throw this in real quick because I was about to go there with you.
[02:40:46.533 --> 02:40:47.814]  I don't think people can understand.
[02:40:48.235 --> 02:40:55.541]  In World War II, Hitler tried to bomb the factories and tried to bomb the electricity grids in England.
[02:40:56.001 --> 02:40:58.584]  And then, of course, once we attacked back, that's what we targeted.
[02:40:59.184 --> 02:41:01.726]  But thousands of power plants have been shut down here.
[02:41:01.746 --> 02:41:08.591]  I know hundreds in England, hundreds and hundreds in Spain, as you know, making them go from being very successful to falling apart.
[02:41:09.152 --> 02:41:13.635]  China has no environmental standards, no regulations, no scrubbers on their smokestacks.
[02:41:14.016 --> 02:41:18.759]  And then I turn on Fox News this morning and it's like Trump is hurting the earth.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.202]  Trump is a bad guy.
[02:41:23.003 --> 02:41:28.447]  He's allowing, you know, with oil drilling or factories, some methane to escape.
[02:41:28.567 --> 02:41:31.009]  So again, as if methane hasn't always been in the atmosphere.
[02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:35.512]  So we're all straightjacketed in business, but China isn't.
[02:41:35.532 --> 02:41:37.814]  And what you're saying is beyond just carbon taxes.
[02:41:38.114 --> 02:41:40.256]  It's at every point it was done strategically.
[02:41:40.456 --> 02:41:41.117]  Can you speak to that?
[02:41:42.287 --> 02:41:43.587]  Well, this is exactly the point.
[02:41:43.627 --> 02:41:51.250]  I mean, the reason why the carbon taxes are so important is that that is a tax on every business and on every household.
[02:41:51.690 --> 02:41:53.070]  That's the key to the whole thing.
[02:41:53.130 --> 02:42:00.493]  That's why the number one issue for the international communist and fascist left worldwide is so-called global warming.
[02:42:00.713 --> 02:42:04.774]  That's why even Fox News is going stupid on this issue.
[02:42:05.334 --> 02:42:10.015]  Just at the moment when the science is establishing the whole thing's nonsense.
[02:42:10.095 --> 02:42:17.657]  I spent a happy dinner, six hour dinner actually, with three very eminent climate scientists in Ireland just last week.
[02:42:18.018 --> 02:42:26.100]  What they've discovered is that the atmosphere is in thermodynamic equilibrium and that means the greenhouse effect can't be causing any warming at all.
[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:28.881]  Such little warming as we've had is therefore coming from the sun.
[02:42:29.301 --> 02:42:33.542]  These new results which drive a coach and horses through this nonsense.
[02:42:34.122 --> 02:42:36.322]  I don't think you can hear me, but we've got to go to break.
[02:42:36.342 --> 02:42:37.703]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:03.829 --> 02:43:05.570]  Laura in Alabama.
[02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:06.631]  Laura, you're on the air.
[02:43:06.691 --> 02:43:06.951]  Go ahead.
[02:43:33.809 --> 02:43:46.754]  Well, thank you for your kind words, because take that wound gel.
[02:43:46.814 --> 02:43:48.595]  We're the only other company in the U.S.
[02:43:48.735 --> 02:43:52.856]  that has licensed it from the Colorado company that's very famous, that has FDA approval.
[02:43:52.876 --> 02:44:01.580]  It's used in hospitals, it's sold in pharmacies, and then we private label it as Silver Wound Gel, which is a pre-gel, tiny bit, covers your hands, everything.
[02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:05.922]  And then disinfects all day long or put it on once you have a cut or something.
[02:44:05.942 --> 02:44:09.403]  Now, it's so super strong, you can't take it internally or it's poisonous.
[02:44:09.543 --> 02:44:13.505]  But yes, it is the strongest FDA over-the-counter silver there is.
[02:44:13.585 --> 02:44:15.026]  So that is one of our best sellers.
[02:44:15.066 --> 02:44:16.006]  People absolutely love it.
[02:44:16.166 --> 02:44:16.466]  Thank you.
[02:44:16.606 --> 02:44:19.167]  And I can tell you this, my neighbor burned his finger a little bit.
[02:44:19.187 --> 02:44:22.729]  We're building a fire outside and I ran inside and got it and put it on his finger.
[02:44:22.769 --> 02:44:25.930]  And he said to me, is this supposed to work instantly and like this?
[02:44:26.110 --> 02:44:27.211]  And I said, yep, sure does.
[02:44:27.311 --> 02:44:29.111]  So it's fantastic stuff.
[02:44:29.191 --> 02:44:30.012]  I highly recommend it.
[02:44:33.740 --> 02:44:37.365]  Well, today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[02:44:39.509 --> 02:44:42.994]  I just devoured your cousin, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[02:45:04.619 --> 02:45:08.581]  What's going on here?
[02:45:41.224 --> 02:45:46.588]  Josh in Washington.
[02:45:46.608 --> 02:45:47.108]  You're on the air.
[02:45:47.148 --> 02:45:47.448]  Go ahead.
[02:45:47.688 --> 02:45:48.869]  Alex, God bless you.
[02:45:49.009 --> 02:45:51.371]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[02:45:51.451 --> 02:45:56.494]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[02:45:56.594 --> 02:45:56.994]  Ooh, yeah.
[02:45:58.055 --> 02:45:59.416]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[02:45:59.436 --> 02:46:01.238]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[02:46:01.278 --> 02:46:02.159]  Totally changed my life.
[02:46:02.339 --> 02:46:08.825]  I use Turbo Force, Body Yeast, Alpha Power, Brain Force, Fish Oil, Ultra 12 daily, X2 every several days now.
[02:46:09.126 --> 02:46:17.353]  And what I've found is really combining them is a totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[02:46:17.433 --> 02:46:20.757]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not?
[02:46:20.817 --> 02:46:22.919]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to
[02:46:23.319 --> 02:46:23.939]  To be incredible.
[02:46:23.979 --> 02:46:30.623]  Whether it's turmeric, or whether it's the fish oil, or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[02:46:30.763 --> 02:46:33.165]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel in the body.
[02:46:33.245 --> 02:46:35.646]  People think just dumping energy drinks on it will do something.
[02:46:35.666 --> 02:46:37.508]  No, if your base isn't there, none of it works.
[02:46:37.528 --> 02:46:40.609]  But you take these bases together, then you have your foundation.
[02:46:40.830 --> 02:46:42.511]  Now you can build the big, strong temple.
[02:46:42.531 --> 02:46:43.591]  It's not that I'm perfect either.
[02:46:43.611 --> 02:46:44.672]  I treat my body really bad.
[02:46:44.712 --> 02:46:48.854]  But with these products I take, and I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better.
[02:46:48.874 --> 02:46:51.636]  And then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[02:46:51.716 --> 02:46:52.397]  Thank you so much.
[02:46:52.417 --> 02:46:52.937]  God bless you.
[02:47:06.630 --> 02:47:09.234]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:33.291 --> 02:47:33.631]  All right.
[02:47:34.332 --> 02:47:36.413]  For Christopher Monckton, yes.
[02:47:37.273 --> 02:47:46.839]  And I really just cannot state enough how amazing the Liberty Movement's success has been, rebooting what I call the New Enlightenment or the Renaissance as well.
[02:47:47.980 --> 02:47:51.362]  And I don't think Monckton and myself cooked that up together.
[02:47:51.382 --> 02:47:52.763]  I think we're looking historically
[02:47:53.951 --> 02:48:01.235]  At the Gutenberg Press, Christianity, all the things that developed the Renaissance, and here we are.
[02:48:01.335 --> 02:48:11.860]  And it's really the real Enlightenment, the classical liberals, versus the leftists, the legalists, out of China, the Jacobins out of France, that Monkton and I have talked about so much on air.
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:16.342]  So, Trump's not perfect, you're not perfect, none of us are perfect, but it's for real.
[02:48:16.763 --> 02:48:20.584]  And that's why you see everybody bought off by the multinationals and the chi-coms.
[02:48:20.905 --> 02:48:22.666]  This is supposed to be the chi-com century.
[02:48:23.806 --> 02:48:27.048]  Supposed to be the Hitler Millennium, but that was dead on arrival.
[02:48:28.029 --> 02:48:35.853]  But they're gonna strike back, and they are striking back with racial division, cultural division, the private fellow reserves trying to sabotage the Trump recovery.
[02:48:36.433 --> 02:48:45.619]  They're striking back in the UK very hard as well, but give us the lay of the land from your expert perspective and how you think they're gonna strike back, as you were mentioning that as we hit the break.
[02:48:47.492 --> 02:48:53.513]  What they're going to do is they're going to continue the climate change nonsense until we prove them wrong.
[02:48:53.553 --> 02:48:59.215]  And we're getting very close to that now, and you and I have spoken about that before, so I won't go too much into detail there.
[02:48:59.735 --> 02:49:09.097]  But they are going to get... Well, it's been so long though, you're the... I mean, give us a short update on just how disproved, because it's flooding in, mainline scientists, studies, them faking stuff, it's incredible.
[02:49:09.707 --> 02:49:10.087]  That's right.
[02:49:10.587 --> 02:49:11.388]  Very short, then.
[02:49:11.808 --> 02:49:14.509]  Our own result is struggling through peer review.
[02:49:14.589 --> 02:49:17.309]  We're getting increasingly feeble opposition to it.
[02:49:17.369 --> 02:49:22.291]  And in the end, they're going to have to give in and print it in a leading journal.
[02:49:22.431 --> 02:49:26.572]  Once they do, that's officially, in scientific terms, the end of the climate scare.
[02:49:26.953 --> 02:49:37.576]  If the Connolly's result, which I think is even more important than ours, also gets through peer review, though they haven't written their paper yet, that demolishes the entire thing from top to bottom.
[02:49:38.306 --> 02:49:41.888]  And I think those two are very, very bright.
[02:49:41.908 --> 02:49:42.908]  They're very, very clever.
[02:49:42.948 --> 02:49:45.649]  They have joined up a number of dots that nobody else had seen.
[02:49:46.070 --> 02:49:48.651]  They've gone back to 100 years, to 1919.
[02:49:48.971 --> 02:50:00.616]  They found a paper by Albert Einstein that demonstrates that if the atmosphere is in what's called thermodynamic equilibrium, then the greenhouse effect, though it's still real, can't cause any warming.
[02:50:01.207 --> 02:50:15.012]  And they have found, by careful measurement in the radiosound record, which is the balloon-mounted measuring devices that have been going up for 80 years, we've got 20 million of these records, that the atmosphere is indeed in thermodynamic equilibrium.
[02:50:15.052 --> 02:50:18.853]  And that runs the coach and horses through the entire global warming storyline.
[02:50:19.373 --> 02:50:23.375]  So, we're both, we're now in a race... But quantify that for lay people.
[02:50:23.395 --> 02:50:29.697]  Quantify that for lay people, that the atmosphere goes through flux and has countermeasures that end up balancing it out.
[02:50:30.745 --> 02:50:38.287]  Yeah, essentially what it is, is that what goes in must come out of the atmosphere as far as thermodynamics is concerned.
[02:50:38.587 --> 02:50:43.548]  It is in equilibrium and you can measure this in a very clever way that the Connolly's have discovered.
[02:50:43.568 --> 02:50:55.010]  I won't go into the details, all I'll say is that in my estimation they've done it and that once their result is published there'll be red faces all round, including mine, because I wish I'd spotted it, it's so clever!
[02:50:55.230 --> 02:50:56.332]  We also see them panicking.
[02:50:56.372 --> 02:50:58.575]  I've never seen so much global warming did this.
[02:50:58.956 --> 02:51:00.819]  Global warming made you slip on a banana peel.
[02:51:00.879 --> 02:51:03.804]  I've never seen such frantic climate change.
[02:51:03.964 --> 02:51:08.492]  Meanwhile, Obama's buying $14 million houses right at sea level.
[02:51:09.674 --> 02:51:12.956]  It's 13 foot 6 above sea level, that house of his.
[02:51:12.996 --> 02:51:22.783]  I had a look on the map just this morning to see where it is, and if he really believed that sea level was going to rise, he would never have thought of buying that property.
[02:51:23.243 --> 02:51:28.087]  So, and this is in Martha's Vineyard, it's on a little pond just by the ocean.
[02:51:28.707 --> 02:51:31.170]  And there's nothing to stop the sea level rising.
[02:51:31.230 --> 02:51:40.478]  Oh, there I see you've got a picture of Greta Thunberg, who's one of these zombie school kids who've been relentlessly propagandised by Marxists in the schools and universities.
[02:51:40.779 --> 02:51:42.500]  That's another thing we're going to have to deal with.
[02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:44.782]  Marxism in the schools is going to have to be rooted out.
[02:51:45.343 --> 02:51:52.690]  But for the time being, they are panicking because they now know – there's the picture of Obama's house – they now know
[02:51:53.579 --> 02:51:55.520]  That global warming isn't a real problem.
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:56.941]  They know we know.
[02:51:57.081 --> 02:51:58.761]  They know that we're about to prove it.
[02:51:59.081 --> 02:52:09.686]  And so they're in full-on panic mode to try to get governments to make binding commitments to destroy the economies of the West before everybody wakes up and realises what nonsense it all is.
[02:52:10.066 --> 02:52:12.507]  And that's why you're seeing these panic measures.
[02:52:12.547 --> 02:52:17.869]  The BBC every day has three or four bedwetting stories about global warming.
[02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:18.810]  It's pathetic.
[02:52:19.230 --> 02:52:19.530]  Really?
[02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:22.011]  And they're calling for you to be arrested?
[02:52:22.391 --> 02:52:24.012]  They don't want us to have free speech either.
[02:52:25.073 --> 02:52:36.358]  Well, of course the BBC has changed its editorial guidelines so as to deny the likes of me who question the global warming storyline to which they adhere, the Communist Party line on the climate.
[02:52:36.618 --> 02:52:39.479]  Anyone who questions that doesn't get on the BBC.
[02:52:39.519 --> 02:52:46.062]  The BBC is required to be impartial and it has announced that on global warming it's not going to be impartial.
[02:52:46.562 --> 02:52:48.003]  Even though it knows
[02:52:48.303 --> 02:52:48.663]  Sure, sure.
[02:52:48.683 --> 02:52:50.945]  So that thing's falling apart and they don't know what to do.
[02:52:50.965 --> 02:52:52.445]  How else are they going to strike back?
[02:53:11.991 --> 02:53:26.528]  Well, the next thing they're doing is they've just published a hit list of 386 named climate sceptics whom they call contrarians, deniers and denialists, with a deliberate overlay of Holocaust denial.
[02:53:26.568 --> 02:53:27.770]  That's what they're accusing us of.
[02:53:28.170 --> 02:53:31.094]  And they've done this in nature communications.
[02:53:31.354 --> 02:53:50.746]  Which is supposedly a serious scientific journal, and essentially they've published a blacklist, they've named us, and they've said, whatever you do, do not publish papers from these people in your learned journals, do not let them on the news media, silence them, silence them, silence them, because if they speak, they will prove that we've been wrong all along.
[02:53:51.386 --> 02:53:59.732]  It's the most extraordinary libel and I for one am considering a libel suit against them in the High Court here in the United Kingdom.
[02:54:00.072 --> 02:54:11.239]  I've given them every chance to retract, to remove all identifiers linking to my name in that study and to in fact take the whole study down because it's a piece of complete nonsense.
[02:54:11.559 --> 02:54:18.844]  But if they don't do that then we go to court and we have a very good chance indeed
[02:54:19.264 --> 02:54:21.105]  So what they're doing is trying to silence us?
[02:54:40.456 --> 02:54:45.044]  Lord Monckton, it's always amazing to have you on WhatsUpWithThat.com.
[02:54:45.365 --> 02:54:47.248]  Of course, you've always had science and public policy.
[02:54:47.268 --> 02:54:48.811]  There's also Climate Depot.
[02:54:49.051 --> 02:54:52.597]  Are there any other places people should visit to find your valuable work?
[02:54:53.482 --> 02:55:08.147]  That would be, whatsupwiththat.com is the best place you can see the update on the court case there and just keep in touch and watch out because the global warming storyline is going to go down in the next year or two and with it the international left.
[02:55:08.927 --> 02:55:13.869]  And you're the one predicting on this show for over a decade that the EU would be dead somewhere after 2020.
[02:55:13.929 --> 02:55:16.229]  That's coming true so please join us again.
[02:55:16.569 --> 02:55:17.930]  You've certainly got your finger on the pulse.
[02:55:17.950 --> 02:55:18.230]  Thank you.
[02:55:19.366 --> 02:55:23.308]  God bless you, and keep up your good work, and we'll get you back on YouTube as soon as we can.
[02:55:23.549 --> 02:55:24.629]  Well, thank you so much.
[02:55:24.689 --> 02:55:34.355]  Yeah, there was a big stunt where they said, oh, everyone's invited back, and then by the CEO, and then Owen put InfoWars back up his own show, and they banned it in two hours, and that's all over the news.
[02:55:34.415 --> 02:55:35.156]  It's just crazy.
[02:55:35.756 --> 02:55:39.979]  Nick Begich hosts Friday another great scientist, another trailblazer, another maverick.
[02:55:40.299 --> 02:55:41.960]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:55:42.300 --> 02:55:43.561]  He's coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:55:44.121 --> 02:55:47.984]  Please don't forget, our flagship product is DNA Force Plus.
[02:55:48.624 --> 02:55:55.928]  It has the strong PQQ, the CoQ10, and a bunch of other known ingredients that are patented and certified.
[02:55:55.968 --> 02:55:59.510]  And you can actually make claims that make the telomeres last longer.
[02:55:59.870 --> 02:56:01.091]  That's how you age.
[02:56:01.631 --> 02:56:04.773]  That take the toxins out of the mitochondria, out of the cells.
[02:56:05.373 --> 02:56:09.216]  I mean, it's been proven to be able to regrow nerves in many cases.
[02:56:09.696 --> 02:56:11.477]  It's been proven to do a lot of things.
[02:56:12.097 --> 02:56:13.698]  The ingredients that are in it, it's 50% off.
[02:56:15.299 --> 02:56:17.001]  Because I want you to see how amazing it is.
[02:56:17.121 --> 02:56:22.887]  And I want you to understand it's very expensive to even package this and put this together and get these nutraceuticals.
[02:56:22.907 --> 02:56:26.751]  98% reviews of that, of DNA Force Plus.
[02:56:27.052 --> 02:56:32.558]  Get a free bottle of Carnivore Enzyme System that helps dissolve the protein and fat.
[02:56:32.778 --> 02:56:35.501]  A lot of us folks that are pretty much carnivores love meat.
[02:56:35.981 --> 02:56:37.243]  It just does such good work.
[02:56:38.857 --> 02:56:50.547]  With the MycoZx, it targets the yeast, the mold, the candida, and then a normal, you know, good high-quality, like our Floralife high-quality system that is a probiotic.
[02:56:50.628 --> 02:56:51.709]  These things all work together.
[02:56:51.749 --> 02:56:57.514]  A free bottle of Carnivore, the 30 count is free with 25% off on Supermelt Vitality.
[02:56:57.594 --> 02:57:03.139]  A 90 count is free, because I want you to experience it when you get it with DNA Force.
[02:57:04.554 --> 02:57:05.315]  I'll explain something.
[02:57:05.795 --> 02:57:09.499]  A bottle of Carnivore, the 90 count, cost us almost $18.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:10.881]  Like $17.80.
[02:57:11.161 --> 02:57:14.525]  The 30 count cost us over $7.
[02:57:15.406 --> 02:57:16.987]  I mean, this isn't cheap enzymes.
[02:57:17.028 --> 02:57:18.529]  This is the Rolls Royce.
[02:57:18.970 --> 02:57:19.971]  Carnivore is amazing.
[02:57:20.231 --> 02:57:21.753]  And I'm going to reorder it for next year.
[02:57:22.033 --> 02:57:23.394]  But we won't have it in until next year.
[02:57:24.055 --> 02:57:26.498]  So, I'm selling it all out.
[02:57:27.711 --> 02:57:34.058]  And then I'm going to take some of the profit from DNA Force Plus and reorder the Carnivore, because it's something that's so important we haven't promoted properly.
[02:57:34.198 --> 02:57:38.362]  So get your free bottles of that with your DNA Force, 3% off, and fund the InfoWars.

[02:59:56.533 --> 03:00:00.537]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:01.558 --> 03:00:05.603]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:05.703 --> 03:00:10.508]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:22.577 --> 03:00:24.578]  The energy rising.
[03:00:24.638 --> 03:00:27.939]  I can feel humanity awakening.
[03:00:28.919 --> 03:00:29.740]  And it's exciting.
[03:00:30.960 --> 03:00:37.623]  I can see the globalist attempts to intimidate us and to make us feel failed and ugly and bad.
[03:00:39.025 --> 03:00:46.287]  Disappearing, like when a big wind comes in and just removes all that dirty fog and the sun rises.
[03:00:47.087 --> 03:00:49.227]  Doesn't mean we're out of the woods, doesn't mean there won't be problems.
[03:00:49.508 --> 03:00:52.748]  I'm not offering some communist or globalist or fascist utopia.
[03:00:53.308 --> 03:00:59.590]  I'm saying good people have stood down and allowed corrupt and evil individuals to take over.
[03:01:01.050 --> 03:01:07.652]  Just three months ago, using my name got banned on Facebook and Instagram in a positive way.
[03:01:08.373 --> 03:01:16.256]  When they said, Jones put out a misleading video that on Instagram had 10 million views.
[03:01:16.276 --> 03:01:17.236]  It was all over the news.
[03:01:17.996 --> 03:01:21.657]  It said Joe Biden may have had another stroke and is slurring his words.
[03:01:22.558 --> 03:01:24.318]  Well, he had a huge stroke, almost died.
[03:01:24.338 --> 03:01:27.079]  Had brain surgery years ago.
[03:01:27.820 --> 03:01:29.020]  Now he suddenly can't talk.
[03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:31.601]  And they banned me.
[03:01:33.522 --> 03:01:51.448]  Within a month, everybody started saying he's slurring his words, he's stumbling, he can't remember anything, he's telling all sorts of stories about how he was in, you know, office last year, and how he was, you know, all these war stories that aren't true, and just one gaffe, one foot in the mouth after another.
[03:01:52.571 --> 03:02:09.860]  Well it turns out he's like Brian Williams of MSNBC saying he was in a helicopter shot down by an RPG and Hillary who was on the ground supposedly in Bosnia-Herzegovina and she got shot at in the thing.
[03:02:09.980 --> 03:02:10.700]  None of it was true.
[03:02:11.861 --> 03:02:12.621]  And here he is now.
[03:02:14.926 --> 03:02:15.807]  Connecticut Post.
[03:02:15.987 --> 03:02:19.670]  As he campaigns for President, Joe Biden tells a moving but false war story.
[03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:24.034]  Joe Biden painted a vivid scene from 400 people packed in a college meeting hall.
[03:02:24.274 --> 03:02:28.437]  A four-star general had asked the Vice President to travel to Kunar, a province in Afghanistan.
[03:02:28.737 --> 03:02:34.362]  A dangerous foray into God-forsaken country to recognize the remarkable heroism of a Navy captain.
[03:02:34.863 --> 03:02:38.806]  Some told him it was too risky, but Biden said he brushed off the concerns.
[03:02:39.146 --> 03:02:39.306]  He
[03:02:40.347 --> 03:02:41.854]  ...can lose a vice president.
[03:02:41.894 --> 03:02:45.087]  He said, we can't lose many more of these kids.
[03:02:45.227 --> 03:02:45.689]  No joke.
[03:02:48.567 --> 03:02:49.708]  Wow, he's willing to die for us.
[03:02:49.728 --> 03:02:51.309]  What an incredible individual, Joe Biden.
[03:02:52.010 --> 03:03:00.837]  That Navy captain, Biden recalled Friday night, had rappelled down a 60-foot ravine under fire and retrieved a body of an American comrade, carrying him on his back.
[03:03:01.197 --> 03:03:05.881]  Now the general wanted Biden to pin a silver star on the American hero despite his bravery, felt like a failure.
[03:03:06.241 --> 03:03:11.426]  He said, sir, I don't want the damn thing, said Biden, the jaw clenching and his voice rising to a shout.
[03:03:12.725 --> 03:03:13.945]  Do not pin it on me, sir.
[03:03:14.045 --> 03:03:14.826]  Do not pin it on me.
[03:03:15.386 --> 03:03:15.886]  He died.
[03:03:15.966 --> 03:03:16.426]  He died.
[03:03:16.726 --> 03:03:17.486]  The room was silent.
[03:03:18.266 --> 03:03:21.267]  That's the God's truth, Biden said as he told the story.
[03:03:21.367 --> 03:03:22.387]  My word is Biden.
[03:03:23.027 --> 03:03:23.988]  Well, you know it's a lie then.
[03:03:24.468 --> 03:03:26.448]  Except almost everybody who tells the story appears to be incorrect.
[03:03:26.968 --> 03:03:28.809]  Based on interviews with those and a dozen U.S.
[03:03:28.849 --> 03:03:31.249]  troops, they're commanders and Biden campaign officials.
[03:03:31.269 --> 03:03:36.991]  It appears, though, the former vice president had jumbled elements of at least three actual events into one story of bravery.
[03:03:38.271 --> 03:03:41.772]  Comparison and regret that never happened and that Biden was never even at.
[03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:47.551]  Beyond Brian Williams.
[03:03:48.612 --> 03:03:51.854]  And on Sunday, I'll play the clip for you and we'll go over all that.
[03:03:52.474 --> 03:03:53.455]  Maybe in post we'll add it.
[03:03:54.335 --> 03:03:57.657]  But we're here on the Live Friday Show covering all this.
[03:03:58.537 --> 03:04:00.398]  And that's why they don't want us on air.
[03:04:00.418 --> 03:04:01.679]  Because see, I have a memory.
[03:04:02.739 --> 03:04:05.721]  The average person has one of a goldfish now, but you can get out of that programming.
[03:04:06.598 --> 03:04:09.402]  I mean, the fact that people don't have memories anymore is crippling.
[03:04:09.442 --> 03:04:10.062]  It's scary.
[03:04:10.243 --> 03:04:14.088]  They've got memories for things they like, things they enjoy, but not general memories.
[03:04:14.768 --> 03:04:17.892]  It would train the brain to have good memories and to be able to remember what's important.
[03:04:18.553 --> 03:04:21.737]  And Biden and all these other people think you're stupid.
[03:04:22.358 --> 03:04:23.499]  They think you're morons.
[03:04:23.559 --> 03:04:24.540]  They think you're idiots.
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:25.761]  They think you're done.
[03:04:25.781 --> 03:04:27.603]  They think you don't know what you're doing.
[03:04:27.823 --> 03:04:33.848]  And they think you'll sit here idly by while they try to shut down this operation and bankrupt us, but you haven't done it.
[03:04:34.288 --> 03:04:44.978]  You have gone to InfoWarsStore.com and gotten books and films and supplements and t-shirts and water filtration, air filtration, and things you need to help fund this operation but also help you.
[03:04:45.638 --> 03:04:49.801]  But beyond even financially supporting us, your word of mouth is king!
[03:04:50.101 --> 03:04:52.622]  And is breaking the back of the tyrants right now!
[03:04:53.123 --> 03:04:57.605]  Dr. Nick Begich, straight ahead on the other side of this Friday edition.
[03:04:57.645 --> 03:04:59.046]  Please, spread the word!
[03:05:12.372 --> 03:05:13.452]  Man.video!
[03:05:13.872 --> 03:05:15.113]  Man.video!
[03:05:15.393 --> 03:05:16.533]  Man.video!
[03:05:16.593 --> 03:05:17.633]  Man.video!
[03:05:18.273 --> 03:05:22.274]  Shove that up your... Crawl, you pieces of garbage New World Order!
[03:05:22.774 --> 03:05:24.794]  I'll tell you about that later, but you'll want to find out.
[03:05:25.235 --> 03:05:29.295]  It's Infowars now, but soon, it'll be everybody else who wants to resist.
[03:05:29.836 --> 03:05:33.616]  We are building an army to bring down the globalists!
[03:05:35.817 --> 03:05:37.117]  So get out the way!
[03:05:37.137 --> 03:05:38.517]  Move, bitch!
[03:05:38.577 --> 03:05:39.657]  Get out the way!
[03:05:39.677 --> 03:05:40.938]  Move out the way, bitch!
[03:05:40.998 --> 03:05:41.818]  Get out the way!
[03:05:46.314 --> 03:05:47.496]  Move, O'Donnell!
[03:05:47.516 --> 03:05:48.537]  Get out the way!
[03:05:48.858 --> 03:05:49.819]  Move, O'Donnell!
[03:05:49.899 --> 03:05:50.801]  Get out the way!
[03:05:51.021 --> 03:05:51.822]  Get out the way!
[03:05:51.962 --> 03:05:52.863]  You see them headlights?
[03:05:53.124 --> 03:05:54.546]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[03:05:54.566 --> 03:05:56.509]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[03:05:56.569 --> 03:05:57.210]  Tell me that!
[03:05:57.931 --> 03:05:58.992]  Get out of my way!
[03:05:59.874 --> 03:06:01.276]  That's Americana, bitch!
[03:06:12.419 --> 03:06:19.020]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Begich.
[03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:22.521]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:22.761 --> 03:06:27.102]  And welcome back to InfoWars, InfoWars.com.
[03:06:27.122 --> 03:06:30.502]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and we're here at the end of August.
[03:06:30.983 --> 03:06:36.544]  I can't believe it, end of August already, and our weather's changing here in the north.
[03:06:36.744 --> 03:06:37.744]  You know, I was listening
[03:06:39.557 --> 03:07:04.647]  You know, for the last few hours and thinking about the subject of the day and, you know, between the crazy nonsense on the Democratic side of the presidential elections, you know, but then I think back on when Trump was running against 16 people on the Republican side and the circus that presented so many of the mainline establishment candidates, and we're seeing it again.
[03:07:05.807 --> 03:07:10.691]  You know, they'd rather have someone that, you know, Biden has passed his prime for sure.
[03:07:11.332 --> 03:07:21.539]  The world is waking up to it, and it's unfortunate, kind of sad to see actually someone thinking they can be the President of the United States and can't keep the details together.
[03:07:21.559 --> 03:07:29.905]  That's a pretty scary thing when you think about it, how we're picking our national leaders and what's really behind all of that.
[03:07:29.985 --> 03:07:31.967]  And as I think about the
[03:07:33.132 --> 03:07:51.589]  The information wars as such, you know, sort of how that all goes, you know, and, you know, we've been at it 25 years and on the science side and on a lot of the political issues and how they mesh in a technocracy of the 21st century, which is
[03:07:52.621 --> 03:07:53.562]  Really, all of it.
[03:07:54.462 --> 03:08:07.748]  All of the topics today really touch on that in one form or another, whether you're talking about science, fake science, you know, climate change science, you know, BBC, as we heard from a British colleague reporting on what's going on over there.
[03:08:07.808 --> 03:08:10.049]  But, you know, BBC at one time before
[03:08:10.669 --> 03:08:21.641]  The climate change debate became a debate going back into the 90s, actually had a special on climate where they attributed the changes to solar radiation, which is kind of interesting.
[03:08:21.701 --> 03:08:23.843]  I got to find that disc.
[03:08:23.903 --> 03:08:25.645]  I have it in my archive somewhere.
[03:08:25.665 --> 03:08:32.473]  I got to find it because it's one worth citing, you know, on this show because it's really a big flip.
[03:08:33.373 --> 03:08:43.776]  And what they cited in that BBC special was in fact solar activity from around 1900 going through the late 80s.
[03:08:43.876 --> 03:09:02.502]  And what they found is when supposed man-made materials were at the highest peak of the Industrial Revolution following World War II and the production explosion during and after World War II, actually climates dropped.
[03:09:02.862 --> 03:09:13.429]  For up until the 80s, you know, for almost 40 years, the average climate temperature dropped and it lined up with what was going on with the sun and solar activity precisely.
[03:09:13.949 --> 03:09:25.576]  One of the other factors, and it's mentioned on a video that's only available right now through InfoWars store, and it's the video on climate change that I did a number of years ago.
[03:09:26.156 --> 03:09:30.439]  And one of the things that that we talk about in that is
[03:09:31.599 --> 03:09:32.620]  Undersea volcanics.
[03:09:33.240 --> 03:09:56.414]  You know, when you have solar radiation from the sun hitting the surface of the oceans, which is the oceans are sort of the drivers for so much weather because the way currents carry carry the heat that is locked into the oceans, you know, and it either adds or detracts, but it certainly contributes to the formation and severity of many, many types of weather fronts.
[03:09:57.094 --> 03:09:58.515]  So when you think about
[03:10:00.962 --> 03:10:16.663]  What's happening in Earth Changes, the video I was talking about, Earth Changes talks about the fact that undersea when volcanoes vent and magma is released, 100% of the energy is absorbed into the ocean.
[03:10:17.190 --> 03:10:34.537]  Where is it surfaces sunlight only two or three percent of the energy is absorbed into the oceans and it's kept at the surface because the deeper you go in the oceans just even a couple of feet over a meter even the temperature gradient becomes cooler and cooler and cooler because heat rises.
[03:10:34.737 --> 03:10:35.698]  So when you think about
[03:10:36.318 --> 03:10:49.065]  The Pacific Rim, the rim of volcanoes under the Pacific, and faulting plates where a tremendous amount of energy is released in the oceans, but it's not monitored.
[03:10:49.546 --> 03:10:55.429]  Nobody is paying any attention, and 100% of that heat energy is absorbed into the oceans.
[03:10:55.789 --> 03:11:01.973]  And if you looked at it from satellite map, just like they show the El Niño and El Niños, it's a plume.
[03:11:02.737 --> 03:11:14.540]  It comes out as a plume of heat in the ocean that spreads out as it moves across the ocean, which is exactly the footprint you will see from a volcano venting under the seas.
[03:11:14.600 --> 03:11:24.523]  In recent days, they've been talking about several miles, many, many kilometers of pumice floating across the ocean headed for Australia.
[03:11:24.863 --> 03:11:27.364]  They're talking about how this might be useful to the coral reefs.
[03:11:27.384 --> 03:11:30.505]  What they fail to mention is the amount of heat energy necessary
[03:11:31.025 --> 03:11:52.363]  When that was released that is in the oceans and they're on those seeing the visual and see sort of the map of the Pacific Rim now at any given time a certain amount of volcanoes are going on the surface certain amount are under the seas and this contributes tremendous amount to temperature changes relevant to the Pacific and we see the same venting in the middle
[03:11:52.443 --> 03:11:52.643]  I think?
[03:12:16.770 --> 03:12:18.391]  The evidence will clearly show.
[03:12:18.992 --> 03:12:37.285]  And, you know, when I think back, you know, when did I first write and publish, you know, that the video that you're going to see, Earth Changes, that's, that's the one, you know, and this is over a decade ago, talking about these undersea mechanics, as well as solar radiation.
[03:12:37.345 --> 03:12:39.687]  Now, if you go back 12,500 years ago to the last Ice Age, which
[03:12:43.072 --> 03:12:46.173]  Scientist consensus in the world, there really was one.
[03:12:47.294 --> 03:13:04.781]  What they say is oceans rose 350 feet in that 12,500 years, which is three feet or approximately one meter every hundred years, which is what the alarmists have been saying is going to happen in the next hundred years.
[03:13:04.821 --> 03:13:06.702]  And if it does, it's only the average.
[03:13:06.742 --> 03:13:12.804]  Now, given various periods going back, the cycle on temperature was much higher
[03:13:12.844 --> 03:13:16.727]  You know, we had these tremendous gradients of temperature rises.
[03:13:17.427 --> 03:13:23.271]  And then we had drops, you know, for a thousand years where it got all of a sudden, suddenly colder.
[03:13:23.312 --> 03:13:25.413]  And people are trying to sort that out.
[03:13:25.473 --> 03:13:33.719]  And one of the theories is it was a comet or an asteroid hitting the ice cap and vaporizing a big chunk of it.
[03:13:34.079 --> 03:13:41.865]  And when it did, it actually not only created huge flooding, which many traditions, Christian traditions and others talk about,
[03:13:42.285 --> 03:13:56.716]  But it also lines up with a thousand years of freezing, incredible cold that wiped out many species on the planet, caused again by natural events.
[03:13:56.796 --> 03:14:10.066]  And in those days, the species I'm speaking about are lions and saber-toothed tigers and mastodons and horses in North America and camels and all kinds of things that were here 50,000 years ago, 12,000 years ago.
[03:14:12.548 --> 03:14:24.481]  In fact, the last Mastodons leaving the United States in an island off Alaska 4,000 years ago, which is like a twinkling of the eye, and I guarantee you they weren't overhunted by humans with spears.
[03:14:25.345 --> 03:14:30.112]  So solar cycles, in fact, are the biggest drivers for climate.
[03:14:31.894 --> 03:14:39.704]  Solar flare activity can create huge situations on Earth with interference with our magnetic field lines.
[03:14:41.667 --> 03:14:42.628]  The interaction
[03:14:43.380 --> 03:14:43.660]  I think?
[03:15:06.941 --> 03:15:15.847]  The 1960s, early 1960s, continental drift, the theory that's accepted by everybody today, was totally rejected back then.
[03:15:15.887 --> 03:15:23.513]  And the guy who advanced that theory of continental drift was a coup, as far as everybody in the geophysics world was concerned.
[03:15:23.553 --> 03:15:25.194]  And actually, he was right.
[03:15:25.794 --> 03:15:28.256]  You know, and so what I would say about science,
[03:15:28.988 --> 03:15:35.854]  Is let science be science and let the scientists prove or disprove what is true and keep the politics out.
[03:15:37.075 --> 03:15:44.522]  And then we find out that it's all about environmental science, which is more left-wing propaganda for the 21st century.
[03:15:44.542 --> 03:15:45.763]  We're going to be right back.
[03:15:45.823 --> 03:15:47.064]  We've got messages coming up.
[03:15:47.104 --> 03:15:48.826]  Very important to support this network.
[03:15:49.286 --> 03:15:53.290]  This is Dr. Nick Begich on this fourth hour, Friday, August 30th, 2019.
[03:16:07.944 --> 03:16:10.768]  Nicole in New Jersey wants to talk about GMOs and allergies.
[03:16:11.048 --> 03:16:12.330]  Awesome, thanks for taking my call.
[03:16:12.410 --> 03:16:18.359]  I love InfoWars and what you guys do there, so thank you and the rest of the crew for keeping us up to date with the truth and facts.
[03:16:18.459 --> 03:16:20.502]  Keeping your amygdalas not enlarged.
[03:16:22.998 --> 03:16:23.938]  We're trying, we're trying.
[03:16:24.038 --> 03:16:27.340]  So in New Jersey it's really terrible and I have really, really bad allergies.
[03:16:27.400 --> 03:16:36.186]  So what I want to tell Alex, thank you so much for getting the Alexis Pure Breathe that has truly saved my life and has given me the ability to not have sinus infections anymore.
[03:16:36.266 --> 03:16:43.991]  So if anybody out there is listening and needs to breathe again and sleep right and not have multiple sinus infections, go for the Alexis Pure Breathe.
[03:16:44.071 --> 03:16:45.552]  Wow, so you keep it in your bedroom?
[03:16:45.892 --> 03:16:47.353]  Yep, yep, yep, yep, I do.
[03:16:47.513 --> 03:16:51.774]  And I have a couple that I'll be getting for my mom and dad, and then one for my son and his girlfriend.
[03:16:51.914 --> 03:16:54.135]  And New Jersey is just so air polluted, it's disgusting.
[03:16:54.155 --> 03:17:03.398]  I actually live not far from Lockheed Martin, so there was a lot of, like, lawsuits and stuff that went on when our neighborhood was built about the water and possible contaminants in the water.
[03:17:03.418 --> 03:17:08.900]  So it's actually a backwards way of how I found InfoWars, was looking on a natural way to kill my thyroid.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:12.301]  And so the Selenium is actually what introduced me to InfoWars.
[03:17:12.321 --> 03:17:14.062]  I was like, where have you guys been my whole life?
[03:17:14.582 --> 03:17:16.485]  Yeah, it was definitely a bonus buy.
[03:17:16.785 --> 03:17:18.107]  All right, Nicole, thanks for calling.
[03:17:18.127 --> 03:17:21.051]  We appreciate your support and everything else.
[03:17:21.331 --> 03:17:23.154]  And I might pick up one of those air cleaners.
[03:17:23.174 --> 03:17:24.616]  I have one at my desk, actually.
[03:17:24.716 --> 03:17:26.418]  So maybe I should get one for my house.
[03:17:26.438 --> 03:17:28.421]  Maybe that would help in my bedroom.
[03:17:36.553 --> 03:17:44.056]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[03:17:44.556 --> 03:17:57.561]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[03:17:59.062 --> 03:18:02.507]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space.
[03:18:02.847 --> 03:18:06.952]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[03:18:07.172 --> 03:18:09.295]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[03:18:11.960 --> 03:18:28.096]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[03:18:28.296 --> 03:18:28.997]  InfoWars.
[03:18:29.377 --> 03:18:30.919]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[03:18:44.892 --> 03:18:48.896]  The animated contest of liberty is waiting for you.
[03:18:50.438 --> 03:18:52.219]  But you've got to take it in your hands.
[03:18:52.840 --> 03:19:01.228]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and buck the system and the group collective.
[03:19:01.248 --> 03:19:07.194]  Do that, and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[03:19:07.214 --> 03:19:08.576]  This is the Info War.
[03:19:11.596 --> 03:19:16.618]  I don't believe that they can obtain something if they can destroy the planet before we go to launch fish.
[03:19:16.758 --> 03:19:22.681]  They are just an intergalactic demonic transmission spewed out of hell trying to bring the planet down before the next level.
[03:19:22.801 --> 03:19:25.182]  But we will make the jump and nothing's going to stop it.
[03:19:25.242 --> 03:19:27.422]  And we're going to have a pro-human future.
[03:19:27.522 --> 03:19:28.643]  We're not just going interstellar.
[03:19:28.763 --> 03:19:29.724]  We're going interdimensional.
[03:19:29.904 --> 03:19:33.706]  As we travel up this true stairway to heaven, people won't want to play video games anymore.
[03:19:33.806 --> 03:19:36.507]  They'll realize this is the real universe with the real levels.
[03:19:36.707 --> 03:19:38.448]  This is where you want to get that score.
[03:19:38.588 --> 03:19:41.009]  Not in Super Mario Brother, not in Donkey Kong.
[03:19:41.169 --> 03:19:47.313]  I'm Alex Jones, transmitting from the third dimension, planet Earth, two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm, Milky Way Galaxy.
[03:20:06.010 --> 03:20:08.711]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:23.855 --> 03:20:29.497]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich.
[03:20:35.090 --> 03:20:36.111]  And welcome back.
[03:20:36.891 --> 03:20:44.456]  You know, before the break, we got into this issue of climate change, and I want to carry that a little bit further.
[03:20:44.496 --> 03:20:49.239]  You know, there's no doubt it's warming up right now, at least in my part of the world.
[03:20:49.860 --> 03:20:51.641]  And we've seen it.
[03:20:51.701 --> 03:21:01.047]  But it happened historically, you know, in the background, for those that are seeing the images, you know, is an area that I go to in the summer.
[03:21:01.067 --> 03:21:02.848]  It's a property I have pretty remote.
[03:21:03.468 --> 03:21:10.732]  In Alaska, and I have historic pictures going back over a hundred years on this property, and you can literally see the changes.
[03:21:10.772 --> 03:21:12.392]  I mean, they are there.
[03:21:12.452 --> 03:21:19.376]  You know, the vegetation footprint as you go up my valley keeps getting deeper, thicker.
[03:21:19.436 --> 03:21:20.776]  You know, it used to be up to your ankles.
[03:21:20.856 --> 03:21:28.400]  Now you go through trees and brush, actually brush, and dwarf trees up to your chest.
[03:21:28.900 --> 03:21:35.063]  You know, and that's in a hundred years changes in terms of what's happening on the vegetation footprint.
[03:21:35.503 --> 03:21:56.453]  You know, when you think about recently, there's been some things in the news about Donald Trump lowering the standard, kind of reversing some of the Obama standards on methane release because of natural gas production, which is really a big part of the climate change debate as posed by environmental community has really been a war on hydrocarbons.
[03:21:57.023 --> 03:22:04.906]  Which ultimately it has been for that group, one of the big targets all along.
[03:22:04.926 --> 03:22:10.507]  You know, the problem is you can't run airplanes on batteries, at least not yet.
[03:22:10.787 --> 03:22:16.529]  You know, hydrocarbons are a big part of what's happening in the world.
[03:22:16.569 --> 03:22:17.830]  There's some downside.
[03:22:17.930 --> 03:22:19.790]  Obviously, we've got to figure out some things.
[03:22:20.570 --> 03:22:23.471]  Plastics, you know, are becoming a big problem in our oceans.
[03:22:23.491 --> 03:22:25.152]  We all heard the stories on that.
[03:22:25.712 --> 03:22:29.235]  Certain particulate materials in the atmosphere are dangerous for us.
[03:22:29.255 --> 03:22:46.229]  They create false hormones in the environment, which we're seeing the feminizing of species that Alex has been criticized for, but actually goes back to MIT research in a book called Our Stolen Future, which won acclaim from major academic journals around the world.
[03:22:46.389 --> 03:22:50.372]  The group of scientists came together to talk about this concern.
[03:22:51.255 --> 03:23:07.027]  But on the hydrocarbons issue and on methane release in terms of what's happening in the natural world, methane is indeed 20 times more powerful than what are thought of as man releases of carbon emissions.
[03:23:07.627 --> 03:23:13.632]  But when you think about methane, the biggest releases of methane today are in the northern regions of the world.
[03:23:14.812 --> 03:23:19.356]  The northern latitudes of the world, because the earth is warming, because the sun is
[03:23:20.216 --> 03:23:28.203]  At a higher cycle, along with a lot of other factors, you're getting melting in the northern regions of the permafrost.
[03:23:28.263 --> 03:23:32.526]  In some instances, this permafrost goes back down 1,000 feet deep.
[03:23:32.606 --> 03:23:34.468]  It's frozen solid, okay?
[03:23:34.948 --> 03:23:47.298]  So what's happened is, when that was first flash frozen 30, 40, 50,000 years ago, you know, when you look at the vegetation gradient, now what's happening is it's melting.
[03:23:47.896 --> 03:23:56.080]  And the methane from the natural degradation of organic material locked in the soil is releasing prodigious amounts of methane.
[03:23:56.120 --> 03:24:04.983]  So much so that the cycle of methane released by nature, again by nature, is not something you can put a lid on.
[03:24:05.043 --> 03:24:08.785]  You can't put the finger in the dike and stop the flood.
[03:24:09.305 --> 03:24:16.688]  It's happening and it will continue to happen until something intervenes with that process naturally.
[03:24:16.908 --> 03:24:23.411]  And that could be now the slowing cycle of solar radiation where it becomes cooler.
[03:24:23.431 --> 03:24:33.235]  You may in fact see a gradual cooling down again and the building of glaciers again because glaciers take a couple things.
[03:24:33.415 --> 03:24:35.636]  First takes precipitation to create snow.
[03:24:36.454 --> 03:24:37.495]  So it can't be too cold.
[03:24:38.756 --> 03:24:47.063]  And then it requires snow to stay from year to year, from season to season, which doesn't require very much temperature changes.
[03:24:47.964 --> 03:24:49.045]  But it does require them.
[03:24:49.105 --> 03:24:53.129]  And I think we'll see the oscillation over the next 40, 50 years.
[03:24:53.189 --> 03:24:59.354]  And as the last guest with Alex said, the science is now beginning to come forward.
[03:24:59.394 --> 03:24:59.995]  If we can get
[03:25:00.895 --> 03:25:10.764]  Um, excused from those that would like to still call the Earth flat and still say it wasn't continental drift or whatever else it is.
[03:25:10.904 --> 03:25:12.826]  You know, because here's the truth about science.
[03:25:13.746 --> 03:25:17.409]  About every 50 years, there's major breakthroughs in science.
[03:25:17.469 --> 03:25:22.794]  And that kind of lines up with when people die of old age and their doctoral dissertations no longer matter.
[03:25:24.315 --> 03:25:25.777]  And that's the truth of it, you know.
[03:25:26.998 --> 03:25:30.581]  Real breakthroughs in science happen not because of consensus.
[03:25:31.201 --> 03:25:44.929]  Go back to the 1900s when everybody was saying, by consensus, you can't get anything to fly if it's heavier than air, and a couple bicycle makers decided they were wrong, and voila, the Wright brothers in the industry of flight.
[03:25:45.489 --> 03:25:51.393]  Okay, so science is always wrong in the long run.
[03:25:53.054 --> 03:25:54.636]  Think about it in the long run.
[03:25:54.716 --> 03:26:00.705]  I mean, elements stay the same, but our understanding of them obviously does change in the long run.
[03:26:01.325 --> 03:26:03.488]  And we're always in it for the long run.
[03:26:03.528 --> 03:26:04.350]  At least I hope so.
[03:26:04.890 --> 03:26:07.894]  So climate change up and down.
[03:26:08.075 --> 03:26:08.816]  There's been a lot of
[03:26:10.357 --> 03:26:17.543]  A lot of species that have come and gone from this planet had nothing to do with humankind, and I would argue we're in that same cycle again.
[03:26:18.044 --> 03:26:21.587]  And yeah, we can be better stewards for this planet, there is no doubt.
[03:26:21.747 --> 03:26:26.111]  And this generation, I think, is aware of that, no matter what your political persuasion is.
[03:26:27.052 --> 03:26:31.055]  We can do it better, and I think the world is trying to do it better.
[03:26:32.756 --> 03:26:34.098]  For lots of the right reasons.
[03:26:34.238 --> 03:26:34.898]  But, you know, that's...
[03:26:37.452 --> 03:26:56.404]  Really, the climate change thing is, again, a globalist agenda for streaming shortage, poverty in a way to collect everyone under some squishy umbrella of taxation, in this case, the carbon tax, the United Nations tax, the globalist tax, whatever you want to call it.
[03:26:57.031 --> 03:27:12.198]  The point of the matter is, we remain sovereign within a world of sovereigns, and we should respect each other's differences and even accept each other's differences rather than trying to impose upon each other in the way that we have.
[03:27:12.238 --> 03:27:18.721]  You know, self-governance, self-determination is a fundamental understanding of most Americans, or at least it used to be.
[03:27:20.682 --> 03:27:23.005]  And I embrace that for whoever you are, wherever you're at.
[03:27:23.025 --> 03:27:24.926]  If you want a monarchy, go ahead and have one.
[03:27:24.946 --> 03:27:26.948]  If you want a dictatorship, have one of those.
[03:27:26.968 --> 03:27:33.755]  If you want a parliamentarian structure or a democracy or a democratic republic like ours, by all means, have it.
[03:27:33.775 --> 03:27:36.457]  And if you don't like the one you've got, have a revolution.
[03:27:36.557 --> 03:27:37.819]  Hopefully it's a peaceful one.
[03:27:39.240 --> 03:27:45.286]  But really, you know, it is time to awaken to what is possible, not what's impossible.
[03:27:45.988 --> 03:28:07.465]  It's hard to look at this world in a very different way than the shortage, greed-gobbling globalists that would seek to diminish what we are and create an environment of shortage when, in fact, we are a grain of sand on the beach of the universe, ladies and gentlemen, with great creative potential, if we would but recognize it.
[03:28:08.192 --> 03:28:17.440]  And, you know, when you think about it in the context of the Earth and natural resources and how it goes, the opportunities that we each have remain.
[03:28:17.860 --> 03:28:22.704]  Because we can do things as individual living souls on the planet.
[03:28:22.784 --> 03:28:24.025]  We can do it responsibly.
[03:28:24.906 --> 03:28:28.589]  Anything good was created by one or two people seeing it a little bit differently.
[03:28:28.609 --> 03:28:33.333]  And everyone in the InfoWars with us sees it a little bit differently.
[03:28:33.974 --> 03:28:38.318]  And it's time to awaken our friends and our neighbors to what's possible.
[03:28:38.378 --> 03:28:40.400]  This is the InfoWars in this fourth hour.
[03:28:40.460 --> 03:28:45.024]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and you've been listening to InfoWars.com.
[03:28:46.085 --> 03:28:48.147]  And we've got breaking information straight ahead.
[03:28:48.567 --> 03:28:49.348]  Breaking information.
[03:28:49.388 --> 03:28:51.610]  I'm coming back on live, Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:28:51.950 --> 03:28:55.233]  We have an incredible story that just went live on InfoWars.com.
[03:28:55.733 --> 03:28:58.996]  Be sure and also get his films at InfoWars.com.
[03:28:59.016 --> 03:28:59.737]  They're amazing.
[03:29:08.403 --> 03:29:11.765]  We have to collectively, in essence, burn down the Republican Party.
[03:29:12.485 --> 03:29:19.589]  We have to level them because if there are survivors, if there are people who weather this storm, they will do it again.
[03:29:19.629 --> 03:29:23.711]  Jennifer Rubin, a senior writer at the Washington Post, said that if
[03:29:24.551 --> 03:29:29.873]  Conservatives and Trump supporters can weather the storm of lawsuits, harassment, death threats.
[03:29:29.953 --> 03:29:32.353]  We need to just physically burn them down.
[03:29:32.553 --> 03:29:34.474]  She says there must be no survivors.
[03:29:34.694 --> 03:29:36.074]  What do you think Infowars is?
[03:29:36.234 --> 03:29:37.455]  What do you think we're going through?
[03:29:37.535 --> 03:29:38.415]  You're the target, though.
[03:29:38.495 --> 03:29:41.056]  But I've dared to challenge their Queen Hillary.
[03:29:41.476 --> 03:29:43.556]  I dared to mobilize the population.
[03:29:43.917 --> 03:29:45.517]  You dared to mobilize the population.
[03:29:45.617 --> 03:29:46.337]  And we're here.
[03:29:46.457 --> 03:29:49.118]  And we have energized the core of the nation.
[03:29:49.178 --> 03:29:50.318]  Black, white, old, young.
[03:29:50.458 --> 03:29:52.479]  And people don't buy the propaganda anymore.
[03:29:52.639 --> 03:29:56.583]  So many people walk up to me and they say, you know, I didn't even used to be a fan of yours till I heard them lie about you.
[03:29:56.603 --> 03:29:59.746]  And I had to go hear what you were saying to find out why they were after you.
[03:29:59.786 --> 03:30:01.728]  And man, you've got an amazing broadcast.
[03:30:03.249 --> 03:30:05.171]  I'm shaking more hands than I've ever shook.
[03:30:06.552 --> 03:30:08.734]  I'm getting more support on the ground.
[03:30:09.718 --> 03:30:13.881]  But not financial, because it's only a core audience that actually buys the products.
[03:30:13.901 --> 03:30:21.727]  We're doing something very special, and I can tell you, this special is the very best special we've ever done, particularly with this type of sale.
[03:30:21.747 --> 03:30:23.688]  It's a type of sale we've never engaged in.
[03:30:23.788 --> 03:30:31.193]  But DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10, and everything else you need for your telomeres, your cells, energy, it's the base you need for everything.
[03:30:31.473 --> 03:30:33.615]  If you don't have this, no amount of energy drink's gonna help you.
[03:30:33.795 --> 03:30:34.936]  It's the fount of it all.
[03:30:35.076 --> 03:30:39.300]  It's the very best, you name it, nootropic, antioxidant for your cells.
[03:30:39.420 --> 03:30:39.920]  It's just in you.
[03:30:39.960 --> 03:30:42.262]  And this has got a bunch of patented stuff you can make claims on.
[03:30:42.402 --> 03:30:43.883]  It's unbelievable.
[03:30:44.064 --> 03:30:45.365]  98% reviews, m4ashore.com.
[03:30:45.385 --> 03:30:46.065]  Let me go further.
[03:30:46.225 --> 03:30:48.567]  Super Mill Vitality is our second bestseller.
[03:30:48.747 --> 03:30:51.570]  I don't need to sit there and tell you how great it is.
[03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:56.814]  Cold-pressed herbs, wild harvested, so that they keep their psycho active.
[03:30:56.894 --> 03:30:58.115]  I mean, it's the brain, everything.
[03:30:58.195 --> 03:30:59.356]  Libido, energy, stamina.
[03:30:59.496 --> 03:31:01.378]  Carnivore, digestive enzymes.
[03:31:02.731 --> 03:31:04.571]  This is a product that's been popular.
[03:31:04.591 --> 03:31:07.632]  People that know what they're doing, but overall not a popular product.
[03:31:08.012 --> 03:31:10.472]  I'm not going to get into what these expensive enzymes do.
[03:31:10.592 --> 03:31:13.833]  They don't just help you break down fat or break down protein in the gut.
[03:31:13.953 --> 03:31:15.193]  It does it in the intestines.
[03:31:15.333 --> 03:31:20.294]  If you want to flush out the meat you've been eating and you want to really get healthy, this is amazing.
[03:31:20.374 --> 03:31:21.094]  It's next level.
[03:31:21.214 --> 03:31:22.255]  And so guess what I'm doing?
[03:31:22.475 --> 03:31:25.135]  We are going to give it to you free.
[03:31:25.355 --> 03:31:28.196]  This is the biggest sale of these two items I've ever done.
[03:31:28.316 --> 03:31:30.256]  You get a free bottle of Carnivore with DNA.
[03:31:30.556 --> 03:31:33.237]  We're giving it to you free at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:31:33.277 --> 03:31:36.979]  Take advantage of those two specials on Super Mel Vitality and DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:31:37.019 --> 03:31:38.079]  Without you, we won't be here.
[03:31:38.099 --> 03:31:38.819]  With you, we will prevail.
[03:32:03.885 --> 03:32:07.528]  Donald Trump presents Real Stable Genius.
[03:32:08.529 --> 03:32:11.451]  Real Stable Genius!
[03:32:11.791 --> 03:32:15.694]  Today, we salute you, Mrs. Social Justice Warrior.
[03:32:15.814 --> 03:32:18.577]  Mrs. Social Justice Warrior!
[03:32:18.617 --> 03:32:21.299]  What do you do with a Master's Degree in Gender Studies?
[03:32:21.739 --> 03:32:24.821]  Put on a vagina hat and go fight fascism on the internet.
[03:32:24.841 --> 03:32:26.263]  Stagnation!
[03:32:26.523 --> 03:32:29.385]  As soon as you wake up each day, the outrage begins.
[03:32:29.765 --> 03:32:30.966]  What the f*** did you just say?
[03:32:31.206 --> 03:32:32.648]  Your privilege is showing, and...
[03:32:34.187 --> 03:32:42.850]  Armed with only a keyboard, you tirelessly protect America from fake racism, and fake sexism, and fake some other word we've never even heard of, ism.
[03:32:42.971 --> 03:32:45.351]  I need a trigger warning, please!
[03:32:45.371 --> 03:32:49.573]  So, crack open a nice soy latte, miss purple-haired vagina costume wearer.
[03:32:49.893 --> 03:32:55.736]  You live by life's two greatest rules, punch Nazis, and everyone I don't like is a Nazi.
[03:32:55.776 --> 03:32:56.776]  Mrs. Social Justice Warrior!
[03:32:56.816 --> 03:33:01.418]  Donald Trump, President Forever, Washington, D.C.
[03:33:06.039 --> 03:33:08.646]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:24.269 --> 03:33:28.191]  Tbilisi, Georgia, is the scene of a heinous crime, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:28.911 --> 03:33:45.958]  This morning, I was working out, and one of my friends came over and said, look at this woman slap this little toddler, or this young child, no older than three, in the face three or four times, and then the mother and the father don't do anything,
[03:33:47.110 --> 03:34:05.958]  Well, it turns out, because of the black and white footage, or pixelated footage, that was on the news, people didn't realize that the woman almost chopped the child's nose off, and then stabbed him twice in the cheeks, like a ninja would do.
[03:34:06.278 --> 03:34:12.561]  And so the father goes forward to protect the child, she slashes at him, and it takes them a second
[03:34:13.578 --> 03:34:20.185]  To figure out what's happening, but again you can see it's color video but it almost looks black and white because it's so blown out.
[03:34:20.625 --> 03:34:25.710]  You can barely see the butcher knife but it is a at least 10 inch butcher knife and she tries to stab him.
[03:34:26.792 --> 03:34:29.654]  Butcher knife or not, you do that to my kid, your brains are on the concrete.
[03:34:30.495 --> 03:34:34.640]  But she's a liberal, she's a leftist, an out of work artist.
[03:34:36.004 --> 03:34:37.746]  Dominic Begich understands psychology.
[03:34:38.426 --> 03:34:41.889]  He understands the fact that the system is trying to make us more aggressive, more hateful.
[03:34:42.270 --> 03:34:47.935]  The media is like we're a colony of rats trying to invoke us into civil war.
[03:34:47.955 --> 03:34:51.098]  And you're seeing more and more senseless acts of violence.
[03:34:51.858 --> 03:35:00.866]  And when we go out, and whenever we go to these leftist events, even with flags on our mics that say Action 7 or something else,
[03:35:02.011 --> 03:35:03.032]  They don't even know we're InfoWars.
[03:35:03.712 --> 03:35:04.873]  We say, what are you here for?
[03:35:04.953 --> 03:35:06.975]  Well, I'd like to kill babies up to age three.
[03:35:07.495 --> 03:35:08.916]  Their little voices make me sick.
[03:35:09.556 --> 03:35:12.218]  And well, babies are parasites, and so are children.
[03:35:12.238 --> 03:35:13.259]  We need to kill old people.
[03:35:13.679 --> 03:35:14.580]  And these are women.
[03:35:15.341 --> 03:35:16.802]  We're not even looking for these people.
[03:35:16.842 --> 03:35:18.503]  We have dozens and dozens of these videos.
[03:35:18.523 --> 03:35:21.185]  So let's roll for TV viewers, radio listeners.
[03:35:21.225 --> 03:35:23.526]  It's posted on InfoWars.com.
[03:35:23.967 --> 03:35:29.471]  Woman randomly stabs three-year-old boy in the face in street in Georgia.
[03:35:30.191 --> 03:35:31.371]  Roll that video for me again.
[03:35:31.892 --> 03:35:38.414]  So imagine you're walking along and the father has the daughter, the little boy's right there, three years old.
[03:35:38.494 --> 03:35:41.115]  The woman stabs him.
[03:35:41.155 --> 03:35:45.076]  The father defends the daughter when the woman tries to stab the little girl.
[03:35:46.017 --> 03:35:47.617]  Now, they went and looked up who she is.
[03:35:47.637 --> 03:35:49.478]  She's a liberal artist out of work.
[03:35:50.831 --> 03:35:54.494]  Who wants to attack a good-looking family that has children.
[03:35:55.235 --> 03:35:56.816]  Now, I'm not just saying this about the left.
[03:35:57.256 --> 03:35:59.298]  They have turned into a crazed mob.
[03:35:59.798 --> 03:36:04.462]  Now, I just saw this five minutes ago before it went live on air, preempting Dr. Begich, and he understands.
[03:36:04.482 --> 03:36:05.383]  I want to get his take on this.
[03:36:05.723 --> 03:36:07.245]  But he's covering fascinating things.
[03:36:08.937 --> 03:36:15.040]  And so I just had time to only run into our guys and say, get me one woman saying kill kids to age three.
[03:36:15.601 --> 03:36:16.621]  We have dozens of these.
[03:36:16.781 --> 03:36:20.984]  We put out an abortion video that's five minutes long showing women recently saying this.
[03:36:21.024 --> 03:36:22.785]  So something's happening.
[03:36:23.225 --> 03:36:29.769]  There's a psychoticness like these mass shootings, you name it, where there are more senseless acts for no reason.
[03:36:31.089 --> 03:36:33.091]  Of violence.
[03:36:34.151 --> 03:36:36.873]  And it's getting more intense.
[03:36:37.393 --> 03:36:38.234]  It's getting more insane.
[03:36:38.554 --> 03:36:40.835]  I would imagine this woman's on psychotropic drugs, probably.
[03:36:41.236 --> 03:36:43.437]  It says on the inserts they can make you do things like this.
[03:36:44.217 --> 03:36:51.322]  We also, again, a few days ago, had the 16-year-old man kill his sister and her young daughter, his niece.
[03:36:52.022 --> 03:36:53.263]  His brother was married to her.
[03:36:53.743 --> 03:36:58.746]  He was attacking police, even though they had weapons, and humping with demon noises, going,
[03:37:01.328 --> 03:37:04.309]  Just humping random people and screaming I'm gonna eat your soul.
[03:37:04.969 --> 03:37:07.411]  So it's like a Day of the Dead event happening.
[03:37:08.071 --> 03:37:27.901]  Let's go ahead and play the video of just one of the clips we found in the last couple minutes from a month ago here in Austin at a anti-Trump rally and they're talking to them about how late should we abort children because now they're aborting them after they're born and harvesting their organs via the governor of Virginia and the governor of New York and other states.
[03:37:28.122 --> 03:37:28.762]  So here's that clip.
[03:37:29.525 --> 03:37:30.986]  So when do we cut off abortions?
[03:37:31.046 --> 03:37:31.527]  At what week?
[03:37:32.147 --> 03:37:34.809]  I think at three years old is when we should.
[03:37:34.829 --> 03:37:37.872]  You think at three years old is when we should stop aborting children?
[03:37:37.912 --> 03:37:38.953]  How many times do I have to tell you?
[03:37:40.634 --> 03:37:42.596]  Now, that's all they were able to find from a report.
[03:37:42.656 --> 03:37:43.757]  We have the raw footage here.
[03:37:43.797 --> 03:37:44.618]  I'll have it for Sunday.
[03:37:44.938 --> 03:37:47.520]  She goes on to say, I'm sick of their little voices.
[03:37:48.201 --> 03:37:50.943]  And we have woman after woman sounding like this.
[03:37:51.003 --> 03:37:55.387]  So there is what the Bible talks about, other historians and the ancient Greeks talked about
[03:37:56.047 --> 03:37:58.909]  Times when large portions of towns would just go crazy.
[03:37:59.170 --> 03:38:03.793]  It wasn't rabies, but people would just start eating each other, killing each other.
[03:38:04.374 --> 03:38:06.035]  The ancient Greeks thought it was vampires.
[03:38:06.456 --> 03:38:10.459]  And so they would actually go hunting for the crazies at night, because they would only come out at night.
[03:38:10.879 --> 03:38:12.941]  And that's even on Discovery Channel and History Channel now.
[03:38:13.201 --> 03:38:16.684]  I'm not saying they're real vampires, but Dr. Begich, I'm going to let you take over now.
[03:38:17.144 --> 03:38:18.585]  It's just when I first saw this, I thought,
[03:38:19.466 --> 03:38:20.146]  What a coward!
[03:38:20.186 --> 03:38:24.149]  This woman slapping his daughter, his son, and he's doing nothing.
[03:38:24.189 --> 03:38:26.750]  No, he's dodging butcher knife here.
[03:38:27.370 --> 03:38:33.173]  Just totally, totally, I mean, so really, this woman is trying to carry out a post-birth abortion.
[03:38:33.634 --> 03:38:36.855]  Perhaps she should be a guest of honor at the next DNC debate.
[03:38:36.875 --> 03:38:38.056]  Dr. Dick Meggage, please take over.
[03:38:39.037 --> 03:38:45.960]  Well, you know, all of this craziness, you know, as you look around the world today, it's not just the United States, around the world,
[03:38:47.757 --> 03:38:50.359]  You know, it is, I think, a combination of things.
[03:38:50.919 --> 03:38:53.921]  Firstly, you mentioned psychotropic drugs.
[03:38:54.001 --> 03:39:01.666]  I mean, what people are on by prescription now and the side effects of these is pretty extreme.
[03:39:01.706 --> 03:39:04.768]  And it's something like 1 in 10, I believe, something like this.
[03:39:04.868 --> 03:39:08.430]  A huge number of average persons are on something
[03:39:09.506 --> 03:39:26.205]  You know, when you think about just the violence in the culture generally, people believing they have a right to just feel without thinking, this is a lot of what drives this idea that everyone's entitled to an opinion that's empty-headed.
[03:39:26.925 --> 03:39:28.965]  Uh, and so they express it through emotion.
[03:39:29.085 --> 03:39:39.087]  And what you're seeing is, um, it's easy to trigger this, you know, to create a general sense of dis-ease within a society which we see all around us.
[03:39:39.667 --> 03:39:45.948]  Very few people, um, you, you can say very, very few people are at a level of comfort.
[03:39:46.609 --> 03:39:53.250]  Um, when you look at this kind of, uh, video, I mean, for me, I saw it the first time, uh, you know, as you were talking about it.
[03:39:53.270 --> 03:39:54.390]  I mean, it's shocking.
[03:39:55.967 --> 03:39:57.609]  That people behave in this way.
[03:39:57.649 --> 03:40:01.133]  In my state, a lot of people are armed.
[03:40:01.153 --> 03:40:03.817]  I don't think the lady would have made it very far down the sidewalk.
[03:40:04.878 --> 03:40:07.922]  But, you know, this is the state of our culture.
[03:40:09.103 --> 03:40:14.410]  And people acting out in a way that you never heard about this kind of nonsense.
[03:40:15.091 --> 03:40:15.651]  But it is.
[03:40:16.072 --> 03:40:18.053]  What forms the culture is the media.
[03:40:18.514 --> 03:40:21.996]  What forms a sense of entitlement is the media.
[03:40:22.436 --> 03:40:27.020]  What fuels a sense of dis-ease and disease is the media.
[03:40:27.880 --> 03:40:33.064]  And when you think about these kinds of acts, I think our expectation is we'll see more of it.
[03:40:33.965 --> 03:40:38.368]  And the sensitivity of the population towards it is diminishing.
[03:40:38.508 --> 03:40:39.869]  And the lack of basic
[03:40:40.689 --> 03:40:42.890]  Values that drive the entire system.
[03:40:42.930 --> 03:40:54.837]  When you talk about the interviews and I've watched lots of them from the various hosts of the various protests and most of what you're hearing from the left is a bunch of empty headed parody.
[03:40:55.697 --> 03:41:09.805]  Not very much information flows and that's I think the greatest fear in all of us because we are in an info war and it is about information and it's about connecting not just the heart and the emotion
[03:41:10.569 --> 03:41:12.851]  But connect the head, you know?
[03:41:13.171 --> 03:41:16.253]  Let me ask you this, because we've got a break, and then you're going to take back over.
[03:41:16.753 --> 03:41:19.855]  It seems to be a sacrament on the deranged left to want to kill kids.
[03:41:20.495 --> 03:41:22.297]  They also say, don't have kids, they hurt the earth.
[03:41:22.357 --> 03:41:25.439]  And let's just say it, the media is saying white people are inherently bad.
[03:41:25.699 --> 03:41:27.760]  We're seeing a lot of racial killings of white people.
[03:41:27.780 --> 03:41:29.461]  We're not getting on the whole race bandwagon.
[03:41:29.481 --> 03:41:31.202]  It's just the left is teaching people.
[03:41:31.242 --> 03:41:35.445]  And I think it's been found that she's a liberal artist, a leftist artist.
[03:41:35.465 --> 03:41:36.526]  I think it's going to be found that
[03:41:36.966 --> 03:41:38.348]  That she was mad at the family.
[03:41:38.368 --> 03:41:39.670]  She was mad because they were white.
[03:41:39.971 --> 03:41:40.571]  She was white.
[03:41:40.932 --> 03:41:47.001]  And that she was trying to, you know, get rid of the evil white people and, you know, targeting the little one like predators will do.
[03:41:47.402 --> 03:41:49.264]  Or perhaps she's just a run-of-the-mill psychotic.
[03:41:49.304 --> 03:41:51.868]  But this is happening more and more and it's happening with women.
[03:41:52.689 --> 03:41:55.312]  I mean I'm not for police brutality but on what planet
[03:42:15.131 --> 03:42:18.774]  On what planet does this woman not have her face caved in?
[03:42:19.154 --> 03:42:21.256]  I mean, that's why I couldn't be a police officer.
[03:42:21.456 --> 03:42:27.821]  If I show up in a woman and stab a little kid in the face, she's going to at least get a... I mean, it's like, oh, I mean, who is this even like a cop?
[03:42:27.861 --> 03:42:30.583]  Who is this person walking with her in handcuffs?
[03:42:30.643 --> 03:42:32.105]  Is that what Georgia police look like?
[03:42:32.385 --> 03:42:34.326]  I mean, the woman's not even wearing regular shoes.
[03:42:34.767 --> 03:42:35.247]  What the hell?
[03:42:35.307 --> 03:42:36.868]  What the hell is going on?
[03:42:36.888 --> 03:42:37.789]  Something's happening here.
[03:42:37.809 --> 03:42:39.050]  Dr. Begich, stay there.
[03:42:39.070 --> 03:42:41.712]  You're taking over and getting us some other key intel.
[03:42:41.992 --> 03:42:42.593]  That was riveting.
[03:42:42.613 --> 03:42:44.675]  We talked about the sun driving climate earlier.
[03:42:44.715 --> 03:42:46.096]  I know we carry your film on that.
[03:42:46.376 --> 03:42:47.557]  It should be in every library.
[03:42:47.577 --> 03:42:48.958]  It should be in every school.
[03:42:49.318 --> 03:42:54.903]  And it's a very well done piece to expose the fraud of man-made climate change, earth change, the ripple effect.
[03:42:54.923 --> 03:42:56.544]  Available at Infowarshore.com.
[03:42:56.564 --> 03:42:57.865]  No reviews, but I've seen it.
[03:42:57.885 --> 03:42:58.366]  It's excellent.
[03:42:58.426 --> 03:42:58.946]  Get it today.
[03:43:17.728 --> 03:43:21.911]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:43:22.511 --> 03:43:23.372]  Please don't forget.
[03:43:23.392 --> 03:43:31.237]  I guess the way that God works, or however this happens, we keep bringing in just the amount of money we need to operate.
[03:43:32.238 --> 03:43:33.398]  And I want to expand.
[03:43:33.478 --> 03:43:35.860]  I want to watch some new shows, which we're doing next month.
[03:43:36.721 --> 03:43:39.863]  I want to be able to put reporters in the field, like we've done with
[03:43:41.143 --> 03:43:42.924]  Overall, four reporters in Hong Kong.
[03:43:43.604 --> 03:43:46.205]  I want to be able to do all these things.
[03:43:46.405 --> 03:43:49.066]  And without you buying the products, we cannot do it.
[03:43:49.086 --> 03:43:51.086]  So just check out InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:43:51.627 --> 03:43:56.488]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get a film, get a great air filter, get a great water filter you and your family need.
[03:43:56.548 --> 03:44:04.971]  Get the new nano silver skin cream that we've got from the same great folks that brought you super silver wound gel that's patented and so incredibly popular.
[03:44:05.111 --> 03:44:06.172]  This is proprietary.
[03:44:06.272 --> 03:44:07.493]  We worked with them to develop this.
[03:44:07.633 --> 03:44:10.455]  This is a brand new thing that just came out last week.
[03:44:10.495 --> 03:44:12.257]  Folks are already getting it in their mail.
[03:44:12.277 --> 03:44:13.878]  We're already giving it five stars.
[03:44:14.038 --> 03:44:17.401]  Infowarslife.com takes you right to all the supplements and all the other products.
[03:44:17.581 --> 03:44:19.863]  Again, the Super Silver Wound Gel is a drug.
[03:44:19.923 --> 03:44:21.304]  It's FDA approved over-the-counter.
[03:44:21.424 --> 03:44:22.685]  Strongest available over-the-counter.
[03:44:22.725 --> 03:44:24.447]  This company let me proudly label that.
[03:44:24.567 --> 03:44:27.890]  We then discounted the Super Silver Cream.
[03:44:28.630 --> 03:44:29.151]  is the same
[03:44:43.786 --> 03:44:44.927]  We're not saying we're drugs.
[03:44:45.087 --> 03:44:46.088]  You have no jurisdiction.
[03:44:46.169 --> 03:44:49.912]  So the FDA said, okay, well, you have to say not approved by the FDA.
[03:44:50.012 --> 03:44:52.515]  So they're always like, Jones sells unapproved things.
[03:44:52.715 --> 03:45:00.523]  Well, that's because the FDA makes all the supplement companies sit there and say that it is not approved by them because by law, they don't have
[03:45:00.703 --> 03:45:01.904]  We're good to go.
[03:45:18.991 --> 03:45:20.912]  That sells coffee!
[03:45:21.133 --> 03:45:21.933]  And toothpaste!
[03:45:21.973 --> 03:45:22.754]  Damn bastard!
[03:45:22.954 --> 03:45:24.515]  A scam that you need toothpaste!
[03:45:24.555 --> 03:45:26.656]  He's a toothpaste snake oil salesman.
[03:45:26.696 --> 03:45:27.197]  Well, guess what?
[03:45:27.237 --> 03:45:28.177]  People love Super Blue.
[03:45:28.197 --> 03:45:30.699]  4 to 5 o'clock little silver and iodine, no fluoride is in it.
[03:45:30.719 --> 03:45:34.441]  So, again, we are very, very, very excited about all of this.
[03:45:34.461 --> 03:45:35.682]  We're energized by it.
[03:45:35.742 --> 03:45:38.124]  And this new product is really putting the wind in our sails.
[03:45:38.144 --> 03:45:40.265]  The only problem is I put in a medium-sized order for it.
[03:45:40.285 --> 03:45:41.806]  It looks like it's going to sell out in the next couple of weeks.
[03:45:41.826 --> 03:45:44.068]  So I've got to end the 25% off at the end of this week.
[03:45:44.128 --> 03:45:44.808]  Take advantage of it.
[03:45:44.828 --> 03:45:48.771]  We have it in the smaller containers and we have it in the larger containers.
[03:45:48.931 --> 03:45:50.634]  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the smaller containers is $7.
[03:45:50.674 --> 03:45:51.475]  The larger container is $14.
[03:45:51.535 --> 03:45:52.377]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:46:11.104 --> 03:46:12.185]  We're good to go.
[03:46:34.668 --> 03:46:35.949]  So get out the way!
[03:46:36.209 --> 03:46:37.349]  Move, bitch!
[03:46:37.409 --> 03:46:38.450]  Get out the way!
[03:46:38.470 --> 03:46:39.770]  Move out the way, bitch!
[03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:40.770]  Get out the way!
[03:46:41.551 --> 03:46:42.111]  Sorry.
[03:46:42.791 --> 03:46:44.092]  Quoting Ludacris here.
[03:46:45.132 --> 03:46:46.353]  Move, O'Donnell!
[03:46:46.433 --> 03:46:47.373]  Get out the way!
[03:46:47.693 --> 03:46:48.653]  Move, O'Donnell!
[03:46:48.733 --> 03:46:49.634]  Get out the way!
[03:46:49.854 --> 03:46:50.634]  Get out the way!
[03:46:50.814 --> 03:46:51.695]  You see them headlights?
[03:46:51.955 --> 03:46:53.355]  You see me knock them curtains down?
[03:46:53.375 --> 03:46:55.336]  Who bought them TVs, bitch?
[03:46:55.396 --> 03:46:56.036]  Tell me that!
[03:46:56.757 --> 03:46:57.817]  Get out of my way!
[03:46:57.837 --> 03:47:00.078]  That's Americana, bitch!
[03:47:05.515 --> 03:47:11.739]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.247 --> 03:47:24.948]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:28.231]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:47:28.891 --> 03:47:30.813]  With Nick Begich.
[03:47:35.092 --> 03:47:37.634]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:47:37.974 --> 03:47:39.235]  InfoWars.com.
[03:47:39.295 --> 03:47:41.036]  I appreciate being here.
[03:47:41.116 --> 03:47:48.962]  And, you know, just before the break, Alex jumped back in on that issue with the craziness of it all.
[03:47:49.742 --> 03:47:56.427]  You know, and I can tell you this, the amount of hate and anger that I'm seeing coming from the left these days.
[03:47:59.068 --> 03:48:01.170]  Hypocrisy at its best, right?
[03:48:01.190 --> 03:48:04.112]  Tolerance at its best, right?
[03:48:05.040 --> 03:48:07.421]  Consideration at its best, right?
[03:48:09.001 --> 03:48:09.781]  I don't think so.
[03:48:10.761 --> 03:48:12.242]  You know, it's what's missing again.
[03:48:12.282 --> 03:48:16.083]  The civility that these guys used to talk about.
[03:48:16.643 --> 03:48:18.583]  Where is the civility in any of it?
[03:48:19.223 --> 03:48:21.024]  Where is the dignity in any of it?
[03:48:21.164 --> 03:48:22.724]  And what's it really driven by?
[03:48:22.804 --> 03:48:24.345]  It's driven by guilt.
[03:48:25.545 --> 03:48:29.546]  They feel so guilty for all the horrors in the world.
[03:48:29.626 --> 03:48:30.326]  And guess what?
[03:48:31.582 --> 03:48:33.664]  It isn't your fault, probably.
[03:48:34.144 --> 03:48:35.605]  Nothing to feel guilty about.
[03:48:35.845 --> 03:48:39.848]  In fact, you know, you kind of have to look around and say, well, it is what it is.
[03:48:39.908 --> 03:48:45.572]  Now, let's actively do something pro-active that unites people rather than divides people.
[03:48:45.592 --> 03:48:53.338]  And what I hear from the left is division under racial lines, you know, political lines.
[03:48:53.678 --> 03:48:58.762]  Every possible division that you can think of, I hear from the left.
[03:48:59.816 --> 03:49:12.825]  Everything that could take and fracture and divide and dislocate the human spirit, they're doing it on steroids right now.
[03:49:14.246 --> 03:49:15.107]  And it's a mistake.
[03:49:16.408 --> 03:49:21.171]  It's a mistake driven by anger and emotion without a whole lot of thinking going on.
[03:49:21.920 --> 03:49:28.823]  Driven by a form of propaganda pushed by the mainstream media and others to do what?
[03:49:29.223 --> 03:49:32.225]  To shape the way in which the world goes.
[03:49:33.105 --> 03:49:35.306]  You know, one of the things that
[03:49:36.418 --> 03:49:49.943]  That you can easily allude to, you know, in terms of the violent acts is media uses each of these events as a way to propagate a set of values that they wish to impose on you based on the owners of those media outlets.
[03:49:50.763 --> 03:49:58.786]  Take a look at who owns the wealth in the world today, and it's the big information systems, communication systems, transportation systems.
[03:49:59.406 --> 03:50:01.407]  Back 40 years ago, I'm 61 this year,
[03:50:02.848 --> 03:50:06.294]  And 40 years ago, in my teens, I talked about three things.
[03:50:06.354 --> 03:50:11.422]  Transportation, communication, information systems would revolutionize the world, and they did.
[03:50:12.544 --> 03:50:16.831]  And now, on top of these systems, we have AI.
[03:50:17.893 --> 03:50:29.123]  Which I do want to talk about because as the populations are being numbed down and dumbed down and drugged up so that you see more and more crazy acts of violence.
[03:50:29.623 --> 03:50:37.710]  In fact, I would bet that in those crowds of protests, a good percentage of those people are in fact Medicaid.
[03:50:38.300 --> 03:50:47.964]  Because the average population is, and I'll bet you if somebody did a poll and maybe there's one out there, there's probably a lot more medicated on the left these days.
[03:50:48.964 --> 03:50:52.026]  You know, because things haven't gone their way and they're a little stressed out.
[03:50:52.606 --> 03:50:57.808]  But the point of the matter is, the reason it hasn't gone their way is it's a miserable failure.
[03:50:57.888 --> 03:51:00.489]  Take a look at what's happened in Europe.
[03:51:01.696 --> 03:51:07.800]  You know, talk about miserable failure and the loss of any cultural connection.
[03:51:08.500 --> 03:51:17.046]  It's happening throughout Europe, whether you're in France, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, anywhere, it's changing dramatically.
[03:51:17.306 --> 03:51:27.372]  And indigenous populations in Europe have the same resentment as indigenous populations whose cultures are undermined anywhere else in the world.
[03:51:28.411 --> 03:51:29.152]  And why not?
[03:51:29.873 --> 03:51:34.517]  And then using guilt as sort of the way to push the population.
[03:51:34.577 --> 03:51:46.108]  The Germans are the specialists at this, you know, still feeling guilty for things that happen that virtually no one's alive to even remember being a participant in, because most of them are dead now.
[03:51:46.408 --> 03:51:47.849]  And it's sad what all happened.
[03:51:47.869 --> 03:51:49.371]  There's no denying any of that.
[03:51:50.606 --> 03:52:02.332]  But look at it from the perspective of acceptance of the facts, rather than denial, or rather than guilt, and somehow you have to do all this stuff.
[03:52:02.392 --> 03:52:06.114]  No, you do it because something might be needed, not out of guilt.
[03:52:06.694 --> 03:52:16.319]  Guilt is a selfish, selfish, let me repeat it, guilt, when you're using it as your motivation, is selfish, self-focused, and doesn't do anything you intend.
[03:52:17.956 --> 03:52:27.585]  Acceptance of where people are, meeting them where they are, and recognizing where people are and accepting that is something entirely different.
[03:52:27.605 --> 03:52:34.832]  And it has to do with the dignity of man and the right to self-perseverance and self-determination on a fundamental level.
[03:52:34.892 --> 03:52:40.557]  Something we've lost sight of in the group, squishy think of what feels good and everybody wins a trophy.
[03:52:41.590 --> 03:52:50.918]  It's not how the real world works, and people who are expressing the levels of frustration because they're figuring it out the hard way, it's unfortunate.
[03:52:50.958 --> 03:52:57.765]  But the media largely has shoved everyone into a perceptual box that does not line up with facts.
[03:52:58.565 --> 03:53:03.630]  And this is why intelligence, brains, and heart need to connect.
[03:53:03.930 --> 03:53:05.091]  They don't run separately.
[03:53:05.471 --> 03:53:05.892]  You can't
[03:53:06.806 --> 03:53:18.209]  You can't be heartless and run like an AI, and you can't be heart-filled without an intellect and run on an emotional pile of litter, which is what ends up happening.
[03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:23.871]  So it's a combination of the two, and it's to recognize we meet people where they are.
[03:53:23.891 --> 03:53:29.553]  If we recognize them as divinely created, we treat them respectfully, even if we don't agree with them.
[03:53:30.305 --> 03:53:37.414]  And if we can find some way of lifting that other human soul, I think by all means we should try and do it.
[03:53:38.155 --> 03:53:40.719]  But meet them where they are, not where we'd like them to be.
[03:53:41.815 --> 03:53:47.040]  Not out of guilt, but out of real consideration of who they are and what they might be.
[03:53:47.521 --> 03:53:56.770]  And then we have a little different operation going on that might actually be constructive rather than destructive in terms of what we're trying to build on the planet.
[03:53:57.130 --> 03:54:02.315]  Together, you know, because at the end of the day, no one's getting out alive and we're going to do this together.
[03:54:03.842 --> 03:54:13.028]  And we're going to do it within the confines of being individuals, sovereign souls, within sovereign nations, within a world that is very complex and very different.
[03:54:13.509 --> 03:54:18.212]  And to try and make it into a squishy mold for globalists is not the answer.
[03:54:18.772 --> 03:54:23.856]  It's the recognition of the sovereignty of individuals and sovereignty of nations.
[03:54:24.696 --> 03:54:30.861]  I want to talk a little bit and switch gears a bit, because there were a couple of things that came in the news that I'm
[03:54:31.613 --> 03:54:33.715]  Concerned about one of them is General Motors.
[03:54:34.036 --> 03:54:36.939]  And it's like I'm making a radical change in the topic.
[03:54:37.179 --> 03:54:51.674]  But I want to talk about this because I read in a publication called International Living a recent issue talking about a great recommendation to buy stock in GM because their Chinese sales now exceed their U.S.
[03:54:51.754 --> 03:54:52.175]  sales.
[03:54:53.385 --> 03:54:57.007]  Now, I wasn't thrilled to read that, because I know the background on this.
[03:54:57.868 --> 03:55:04.051]  And it's in the news again today, because Donald Trump is saying, hey, you know, GM should be moving back.
[03:55:04.131 --> 03:55:10.575]  Because here's how it plays out and why Donald Trump is correct, is we bailed out GM.
[03:55:11.856 --> 03:55:22.042]  And then when we bailed them out, they moved, relocated with $3.8 billion of the money we bailed them out, but they relocated over to China.
[03:55:23.479 --> 03:55:26.161]  And all those jobs, about 13,000 U.S.
[03:55:26.201 --> 03:55:27.742]  jobs, went away.
[03:55:28.482 --> 03:55:29.503]  And we paid for it.
[03:55:30.124 --> 03:55:30.764]  We paid for it.
[03:55:30.824 --> 03:55:47.515]  And then, when the Fed sold all that stock they had bought to prop up General Motors, we lost, the American taxpayer lost $11.2 billion, with a B. Billion dollars.
[03:55:47.575 --> 03:55:49.937]  Okay, that's a lot of money, no matter how you count it.
[03:55:50.533 --> 03:55:53.353]  But at the same time, you know, since then...
[03:55:54.665 --> 03:56:18.852]  Since 2015, GM has bought back shares from their shareholder pool, 14, let me repeat, $14 billion after screwing all of us out of 11.2, and moving the whole operation to China to employ 13,000 people there while they unemployed 13,000 people here.
[03:56:19.553 --> 03:56:24.254]  And you and I, as taxpayers in this country, paid for it.
[03:56:25.603 --> 03:56:25.843]  Right?
[03:56:26.224 --> 03:56:27.084]  We paid for that.
[03:56:27.404 --> 03:56:33.469]  We paid for them so we could lose money, lose jobs, and pay again.
[03:56:34.770 --> 03:56:43.035]  You know, and I want to talk about another group that we keep bailing out, and that no one's talking about the framework under which these bailouts happen.
[03:56:43.396 --> 03:56:55.084]  This is the biggest corporate welfare giveaways in series, adding to the national debt like nothing ever has, and a bunch of freeloading
[03:56:55.908 --> 03:57:08.936]  Globalists just take the money right out of your pocket and leave and laugh all the way to the bank as they buy back their shares and enrich their portfolios even more.
[03:57:09.296 --> 03:57:16.481]  And I'm not opposed to making wealth when it's real wealth and not some big stock play at the expense of the American taxpayer.
[03:57:17.443 --> 03:57:18.584]  Build factories.
[03:57:18.764 --> 03:57:19.645]  Build cars.
[03:57:19.765 --> 03:57:20.686]  Build industry.
[03:57:20.786 --> 03:57:21.927]  Build real things.
[03:57:22.288 --> 03:57:23.729]  But do it in the United States.
[03:57:23.789 --> 03:57:25.451]  Don't export our jobs.
[03:57:25.551 --> 03:57:26.812]  Export our industry.
[03:57:27.252 --> 03:57:31.336]  And then wonder why Donald Trump says, hey, GM owes us a little bit here.
[03:57:31.616 --> 03:57:32.337]  Because they do.
[03:57:32.657 --> 03:57:34.599]  This is Dr. Nick Begich in the Info Wars.
[03:57:34.619 --> 03:57:35.360]  We'll be right back.
[03:57:54.388 --> 03:57:58.569]  Here's Alex Jones displaying, putting the tinfoil hat on display.
[03:57:58.689 --> 03:58:10.633]  As you can see, the tinfoil hat was once a one-piece tinfoil hat meant to sit on your head comfortably, has now evolved into not just a tinfoil hat, but an adjustable antenna.
[03:58:10.713 --> 03:58:13.074]  So not only do you have the tinfoil hat,
[03:58:13.194 --> 03:58:24.799]  To protect yourself against fake news and predict the future, now it's included a tinfoil hat antenna, adjustable antenna, so you can pick up the InfoWars streams wherever you are on planet Earth.
[03:58:24.979 --> 03:58:29.600]  It's the brand new InfoWars tinfoil hat with adjustable antenna.
[03:58:29.660 --> 03:58:37.483]  We're working on getting the satellite feeds up and ready so that you can tune in to the InfoWars live broadcast with your tinfoil hat.
[03:58:37.543 --> 03:58:37.984]  Passion.
[03:58:38.224 --> 03:58:38.564]  Vogue.
[03:58:38.824 --> 03:58:39.244]  Power.
[03:58:39.504 --> 03:58:41.225]  Alex Jones tinfoil hat.
[03:58:41.505 --> 03:58:46.651]  Now, Alex is a man of many talents, but you didn't know he had that type of catwalk ability.
[03:58:46.671 --> 03:58:47.813]  Just look at the attitude.
[03:58:48.133 --> 03:58:50.436]  Look at the flippant nature of defiance.
[03:58:50.756 --> 03:58:51.717]  Look at the rebellion.
[03:58:52.058 --> 03:58:53.520]  Oh, just total defiance.
[03:58:53.760 --> 03:58:58.806]  It's the brand new InfoWars tinfoil and tinfoil hat with adjustable antenna.
[03:58:58.886 --> 03:58:59.607]  You can pick up
