[00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:07.752]  There's already been a steady, continual drumbeat of globalist media calling for Trump's imprisonment, Trump's torture, Trump's death.
[00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:10.733]  But now it's reached a crescendo.
[00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:12.593]  They're making their move.
[00:00:14.054 --> 00:00:20.476]  The individuals targeting Trump and the Liberty Movement are globalists who have signed on for our country's destruction.
[00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:23.563]  They tell us America's never been great.
[00:00:23.603 --> 00:00:24.985]  It's never going to be great.
[00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:26.947]  They tell us our existence is bad.
[00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:28.728]  That's because they're enemy globalists.
[00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:30.950]  They're bought and paid for by the shy comms and others.
[00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:41.881]  We're about to go over the unbelievable statements by Maxine Waters and others where they're calling for the imprisonment and torture of the president.
[00:00:43.282 --> 00:00:43.943]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:46.727]  These are the times to try men's souls.
[00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:48.068]  These are the times that prayer is needed.
[00:00:48.088 --> 00:00:59.302]  And then once you pray, it's time for legal, lawful action to let these terrorists, these psychological terrorists know that we're aware of what they're doing, that they're being routed and defeated because that's the good news.
[00:00:59.782 --> 00:01:04.508]  All this is happening because we are removing these face suckers, these criminals right now.
[00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:09.750]  If he takes the risk of going to trial and he's convicted, that could be seen as an impeachable offense.
[00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.193]  If Trump were caught on a video camera snorting cocaine in the White House, maybe with one of his children, there was at least a chance he'd be impeached.
[00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:19.135]  If he's not a legitimately elected president in your mind...
[00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.187]  There are tools that Congress has.
[00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:25.289]  I don't see how that wouldn't be an impeachable offense.
[00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:32.915]  That tweet fits the Republican definition of an impeachable offense more fully than what Bill Clinton was actually impeached for.
[00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:34.396]  Impeachment is very difficult.
[00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:36.458]  Grounds for impeachment.
[00:01:36.478 --> 00:01:37.679]  It's an impeachable offense.
[00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.341]  Perhaps impeachable offense is impeachment the appropriate remedy.
[00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:42.743]  Something for the Congress like impeachment.
[00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:44.044]  All that may be impeachable.
[00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:45.445]  That's an impeachable offense.
[00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:46.686]  Is that an impeachable offense?
[00:01:46.846 --> 00:01:48.427]  Is that an impeachable offense?
[00:01:48.647 --> 00:01:50.668]  He's much more vulnerable to impeachment.
[00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.850]  A potential ingredient of impeachment.
[00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.871]  Where do you see an impeachable offense?
[00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:56.332]  It is grounds for impeachment.
[00:01:56.352 --> 00:01:58.694]  Potentially criminal or even impeachable.
[00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:01.296]  Grounds for impeachment or does that not go far enough in your view?
[00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.037]  Grounds for impeachment.
[00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:05.519]  This tweet alone may be an impeachable offense.
[00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.379]  Let's talk about impeachment.
[00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:07.480]  Impeachment is on the table.
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.020]  Which impeachable offenses?
[00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.981]  An impeachable offense.
[00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.801]  Do you see an impeachable set of offenses?
[00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:12.921]  It's an impeachable offense.
[00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:15.122]  If that's not impeachable, I don't know what is.
[00:02:15.262 --> 00:02:17.722]  The president shall be removed from office on impeachment.
[00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.763]  Is it impeachable?
[00:02:19.783 --> 00:02:21.163]  100% is impeachable.
[00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:25.564]  Very substantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.264]  Grounds for impeachment.
[00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:28.124]  Tipping point.
[00:02:28.244 --> 00:02:31.625]  Talk of impeachment reaches a fever pitch on Capitol Hill.
[00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:35.386]  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi under growing pressure from her own party.
[00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:36.286]  Here we go again.
[00:02:37.537 --> 00:03:04.546]  By any historical yardstick, the collection of corporations and governments waging war on America, through Hollywood and through the media and through one-sided trade deals, is the most concentrated, but also largest force of evil the planet has ever seen.
[00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:29.254]  If you study other tyrants and other propagandists and other Machiavellian criminals, no one has ever come close to the outrageous lies and fraud and premeditated cultural poisoning that the so-called mainstream media and Hollywood have spewed out.
[00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:44.277]  And now they're trying to create a hot civil war because they can't remove President Trump, who's just a nationalist populist who isn't completely evil and actually thinks we should have a successful human culture.
[00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:48.979]  The globalists are post-human exterminists.
[00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.080]  That's official.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.721]  I mean, I reported it 20 years ago when it was just in their own white papers.
[00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:54.962]  Now it's out in the open.
[00:03:56.331 --> 00:04:01.252]  And in the 11th hour, 58th minute, along comes Trump and other nationalists and populists challenging him.
[00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:03.593]  And you know, Infowars came earlier.
[00:04:03.873 --> 00:04:08.074]  We saw the same problems and believed in humanity and spoke out against the globalists.
[00:04:08.114 --> 00:04:10.394]  And people checked it out and found that it was true.
[00:04:10.454 --> 00:04:11.854]  And we built a movement worldwide.
[00:04:12.154 --> 00:04:13.195]  You built a movement worldwide.
[00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:16.615]  But now, I'm going to play some of these clips in a moment.
[00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:23.637]  You've got Republican governors and members of Congress like Maxine Waters and
[00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:29.460]  Bipartisan groups and former deputy directors of the CIA saying, we're going to kill Trump.
[00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:31.241]  He's guilty of treason.
[00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:32.282]  We're going to execute him.
[00:04:32.703 --> 00:04:39.588]  This is on MSNBC, CNN, and he needs to be put in solitary confinement, which is a form of torture.
[00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:41.750]  Impeachment's too good for him.
[00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.493]  And then when Trump goes, hey, you're the ones trying to overthrow the country in an election.
[00:04:45.753 --> 00:04:46.614]  That's the treason.
[00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:48.535]  They go, oh my God, you're death threatening us.
[00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:49.696]  Oh, you're so horrible.
[00:04:49.877 --> 00:04:51.037]  You should be removed for that.
[00:04:51.912 --> 00:05:00.414]  So there's also the paradox where everything they say Trump's doing or that patriots are doing is what they're doing.
[00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:07.276]  They're the people everywhere on Saturday Night Live talking about assassinating Trump and the New York Times and Washington Post.
[00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:09.437]  I mean, it's everywhere and severed heads.
[00:05:09.497 --> 00:05:11.537]  I mean, it's thousands of times we've seen this.
[00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:14.798]  And then Trump goes, whoa, you're really trying to cause a civil war.
[00:05:15.078 --> 00:05:15.899]  Oh, that's crazy.
[00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.940]  You're trying to cause one when they're openly trying to cause all of this civil unrest.
[00:05:21.937 --> 00:05:22.658]  We're all in danger.
[00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:25.261]  Groveling to these people only emboldens them.
[00:05:25.922 --> 00:05:28.244]  Our only solution is to stand up and speak out against them.
[00:05:28.525 --> 00:05:30.667]  And I'm telling you, they're getting ready to stage mass shootings.
[00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:34.251]  That's why they try to discredit me and take me off the air, because we've exposed they've done that before.
[00:05:34.892 --> 00:05:37.275]  They've staged other big events as well, and that's all public.
[00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:40.379]  They stage all these new Smollett race attacks every day now.
[00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:47.045]  More of that's coming, and we just have to get the word out and keep independent media alive and operating.
[00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:54.152]  And that's why it's beyond critical that everybody keep spreading the word about InfoWars.com forward slash show, ban.video, and take advantage of the big sales.
[00:05:54.512 --> 00:05:58.035]  InfoWars.com, because that's how we fund the operation, and we need money to keep going.
[00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:01.258]  We're in the tightest spot we've ever been in my 25-year history.
[00:06:01.318 --> 00:06:04.040]  We want to expand the face of the globalist, not contract.
[00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.422]  Please visit InfoWars.com and

[00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.330]  We're all in this together.
[00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.751]  And pray for President Trump because he's going after the corruption.
[00:06:27.272 --> 00:06:28.072]  He's the real deal.
[00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:30.113]  And the system knows it's trying to take him out.
[00:06:30.613 --> 00:06:33.755]  Right now, these people have not been held accountable, so they're out of control.
[00:06:34.095 --> 00:06:40.738]  Trump's trying to hold them accountable, and so they are going into full panic mode, and this nation is in the most danger it's ever been in, period.
[00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:41.859]  The whole world is.
[00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:43.659]  We're facing real textbook evil.
[00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.501]  Thank you all for being viewers and listeners.
[00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:50.223]  The fact that you're even here means you really care, and I appreciate you, and you are the leadership.
[00:06:50.423 --> 00:06:55.025]  You are the resistance to this evil worldwide, so I salute you, and I humbly ask you to redouble your efforts today.
[00:06:56.584 --> 00:07:06.833]  When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history.
[00:07:07.273 --> 00:07:11.297]  You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America.
[00:07:11.457 --> 00:07:13.339]  America will triumph over you.
[00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.981]  That apparently directed for the President of the United States.
[00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:20.685]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:07:20.985 --> 00:07:23.467]  As a former government official, government's gonna kill this guy.
[00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:25.788]  There is enough here for articles of impeachment.
[00:07:25.948 --> 00:07:26.589]  Absolutely.
[00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:27.109]  Already.
[00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:33.794]  The president himself admitted that he had a telephone conversation with the president of Ukraine.
[00:07:34.174 --> 00:07:36.796]  He also said he did talk to him about Biden.
[00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.097]  With so many people knowing about this...
[00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:47.381]  It's interesting, and I'm kind of proud to say this, it took a member of the intelligence community to step up and bring it forward.
[00:07:47.461 --> 00:07:53.023]  The United States using our foreign policy to leverage a foreign country to take out a rival.
[00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:56.665]  I mean, that's a very simple story that even the Fox audience can understand.
[00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:02.289]  Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a U.S.
[00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:02.849]  election.
[00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.390]  It couldn't be clearer.
[00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:07.493]  And that's not just undermining democratic institutions.
[00:08:08.093 --> 00:08:09.054]  That is treason.
[00:08:09.394 --> 00:08:10.975]  It's treason, pure and simple.
[00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.517]  And the penalty for treason under the U.S.
[00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:14.678]  Code is death.
[00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:16.099]  That's the only penalty.
[00:08:16.619 --> 00:08:19.682]  The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office.
[00:08:20.102 --> 00:08:24.225]  And that might look like a pretty good alternative to the President if he could work out a plea deal.
[00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:30.121]  I mean, President's only a four-year job, but it feels like it's taken him five years to just fire his ass.
[00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:31.622]  It's frustrating.
[00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:37.784]  You know, I bet somebody explained how long impeachment takes to John Wilkes Booth, and he was like, OK, well, where's he at right now?
[00:08:40.005 --> 00:08:45.788]  The call is the call, but there's nothing here that rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.
[00:08:45.848 --> 00:08:46.328]  Well, they're wrong.
[00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:50.730]  And it remains to be seen, because it's not just what happens in the call.
[00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.451]  It's part of the sequencing of events as well.
[00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:05.998]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[00:09:06.018 --> 00:09:08.460]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.301]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[00:09:09.461 --> 00:09:09.861]  Yes, sir.
[00:09:09.921 --> 00:09:11.123]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:09:11.223 --> 00:09:13.084]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[00:09:13.325 --> 00:09:16.928]  I have InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[00:09:17.048 --> 00:09:19.210]  My truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.112]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[00:09:21.192 --> 00:09:21.912]  God bless you, brother.
[00:09:21.952 --> 00:09:25.656]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[00:09:25.696 --> 00:09:29.019]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:30.242]  You're our only hope, brother.
[00:09:30.262 --> 00:09:32.247]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[00:09:32.588 --> 00:09:35.334]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
