[00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:21.835]  I've known Alex for, like, more than 20 years.
[00:00:22.015 --> 00:00:22.796]  I've hung out with that guy.
[00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:24.477]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[00:00:24.597 --> 00:00:26.379]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.280]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein s***.
[00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:30.122]  That is a f***ing fact.
[00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:32.724]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:35.807]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:38.928]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:45.311]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.573]  Alex Jones supported President Trump but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:55.695]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.996]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just
[00:00:58.496 --> 00:00:58.716]  Yeah.
[00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:01.037]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:01:01.237 --> 00:01:03.297]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:05.158]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:01:05.378 --> 00:01:09.159]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:11.399]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:14.400]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.581]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:26.170]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.572]  The government's poisoning the water?
[00:01:27.992 --> 00:01:28.593]  Absolutely.
[00:01:28.613 --> 00:01:37.445]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose it's poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make them more easily manageable.
[00:01:37.945 --> 00:01:40.346]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one.
[00:01:40.586 --> 00:01:42.467]  He's fighting back against my takeover.
[00:01:42.827 --> 00:01:44.868]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[00:01:44.948 --> 00:01:48.009]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:50.910]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.792]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:57.913]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.773]  Jones says there's a world government.
[00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.774]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:02.294]  It is.
[00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:03.195]  On and on and on.
[00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:06.356]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[00:02:06.616 --> 00:02:12.460]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:18.964]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Faruli, developed brain cancer.
[00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:22.346]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:34.314]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:50.128]  So think about how the LA Times, even Wired Magazine, will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves.
[00:02:50.408 --> 00:02:50.929]  Cell phones!
[00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.513]  ...operate as microwave transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[00:02:54.653 --> 00:02:55.754]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:57.816]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[00:02:57.997 --> 00:03:02.902]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[00:03:02.922 --> 00:03:08.048]  That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[00:03:08.108 --> 00:03:08.749]  You heard me right.
[00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.552]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:17.838]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:31.453]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[00:03:32.153 --> 00:03:33.495]  What may have happened here?
[00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.657]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[00:03:37.398 --> 00:03:43.643]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[00:03:43.963 --> 00:03:53.170]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[00:03:53.451 --> 00:03:56.493]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[00:03:56.613 --> 00:03:58.574]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[00:03:58.875 --> 00:03:59.775]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[00:03:59.975 --> 00:04:02.377]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:04:02.877 --> 00:04:03.538]  Years ago.
[00:04:03.898 --> 00:04:11.223]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:13.484]  He was talking about this years ago.
[00:04:13.504 --> 00:04:15.265]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:22.010]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to go down the rabbit hole on the other side of this, right?
[00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.353]  And really talk about solutions and where to take our planet back.
[00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:31.494]  There is evil in this universe, but there's also good.
[00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:35.298]  And everything we do is about decisions we make.
[00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:50.132]  We've never had more choices as a species, but we've never been less involved in trying to actually choose our own destiny, choose our own path with the money others do it for us.
[00:04:51.294 --> 00:04:57.539]  This broadcast is about exposing the reality of the world the globalists are building and the nightmare system that must be opposed.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.202]  We're here to make sure people know that they have a right to their own destiny.
[00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:09.189]  Donald Trump presents Real Stable Genius.
[00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.152]  Real Stable Genius!
[00:05:13.453 --> 00:05:17.356]  Today, we salute you, Mrs. Social Justice Warrior.
[00:05:17.476 --> 00:05:19.678]  Mrs. Social Justice Warrior!
[00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:22.934]  What do you do with a master's degree in gender studies?
[00:05:23.394 --> 00:05:26.877]  Put on a vagina hat and go fight fascism on the internet.
[00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:31.001]  As soon as you wake up each day, the outrage begins.
[00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:32.603]  What the f*** did you just say?
[00:05:32.843 --> 00:05:44.113]  Your privilege is showing and armed with only a keyboard, you tirelessly protect America from fake racism and fake sexism and fake some other word we've never even heard of, ism.
[00:05:47.017 --> 00:05:51.240]  So, crack open a nice soy latte, Miss Purple-Haired Vagina Costume Wearer.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.164]  You live by life's two greatest rules, punch Nazis, and everyone I don't like is a Nazi.
[00:05:57.184 --> 00:05:58.424]  Mr. Social Justice Warrior!
[00:05:58.464 --> 00:06:03.207]  Donald Trump, President Forever, Washington, D.C.
[00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.851]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:14.455]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:47.102]  This morning, just about two hours ago, I had more than just an epiphany, or a great moment of the light bulb going off above my head, where a lot of data and information crystallized, but I had that sense that I've only had a few other times of a way forward and the next chapters to come, and how humanity is going to awaken and break free
[00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:57.353]  From the Lilliputian big tech ropes and strings and chains that they're busily fitting about us.
[00:06:58.513 --> 00:07:02.214]  And I'm going to go to that at the bottom of the hour because there's some more articles and things I want to print.
[00:07:03.195 --> 00:07:06.675]  Because, you know, I neurotically like to show you the admissions of what's openly happening.
[00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:12.797]  But they knew that tobacco was causing lung cancer hundreds of years ago.
[00:07:13.564 --> 00:07:18.888]  And they know the additives they put in it are what really accelerates it much worse than natural tobacco.
[00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:24.813]  But up until the 80s and 90s, they targeted children with tobacco ads.
[00:07:24.873 --> 00:07:26.094]  We all know that was wrong.
[00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:26.915]  We know that went on.
[00:07:29.477 --> 00:07:32.739]  Well, they're targeting children with things far worse today.
[00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:39.584]  And of course, I'm talking about the cell phones, the radiation,
[00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:47.354]  The 5G, but we should just start talking about how we're going to oppose it and just state it's deadly.
[00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:49.956]  It causes cancer and move forward.
[00:07:52.438 --> 00:07:57.322]  We're going to take down the vaccine makers because that's really a eugenics social engineering program.
[00:07:57.503 --> 00:07:58.663]  It's not immunization.
[00:07:59.464 --> 00:08:00.965]  It's medical experimentation.
[00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:05.269]  We're going to take down the 5G kill grid.
[00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:09.650]  And we're going to expose the whole thing.
[00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:10.691]  We're gonna do it together.
[00:08:10.711 --> 00:08:11.211]  We're gonna win.
[00:08:12.072 --> 00:08:12.652]  It's gonna be rough.
[00:08:14.193 --> 00:08:20.856]  But there are already communities where the rulers are moving to that have federal law.
[00:08:22.997 --> 00:08:23.837]  No cell phones.
[00:08:24.738 --> 00:08:25.498]  No electronics.
[00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:34.763]  And they claim it so it doesn't interfere with the SETI radio telescopes and other things that one cell phone
[00:08:37.606 --> 00:08:41.928]  One cell tower completely blacks all of the reception out.
[00:08:42.128 --> 00:08:46.591]  That's their excuse for tens of thousands of square miles here, tens of thousands of square miles there.
[00:08:47.091 --> 00:08:57.016]  And I've actually now I'm talking to some telecommunications folks about maps that are being put out already where they're not planning to put all of these systems in, in fact, where they're going to prohibit it.
[00:08:58.276 --> 00:09:02.659]  And there's no way you're going to have this two tiered society where the globalists hide from the 5G.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.440]  And where
[00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.230]  We all get fried by it.
[00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:17.073]  Just like you're not going to have the globalists have 0% corporate taxes for themselves offshore, but 40% for us in America.
[00:09:17.113 --> 00:09:17.733]  That's not fair.
[00:09:18.053 --> 00:09:23.835]  Joe Biden's calling for a 40% tax again because he's an agent of China on record.
[00:09:24.895 --> 00:09:26.315]  He and his family have gotten hundreds of millions.
[00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:35.558]  And so he's in the news today saying we need to go back to the corporate tax of 40% or 39 point whatever is the actual number.
[00:09:36.707 --> 00:09:37.768]  Biden on capital gains tax.
[00:09:37.808 --> 00:09:39.368]  We should raise the tax back to 39.6.
[00:09:39.989 --> 00:09:47.152]  Incredible information.
[00:09:48.553 --> 00:09:50.934]  China, when Trump went to 15, went to zero.
[00:09:52.094 --> 00:09:53.615]  Now, do they tell you that in the news article?
[00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:54.496]  In AP?
[00:09:54.516 --> 00:09:55.216]  Telling you how great it is?
[00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:55.796]  No, they don't tell you.
[00:09:57.417 --> 00:10:03.300]  So that just ties into one little example of how this two-sided system works, where it's all one-sided for China.
[00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:14.999]  And that takes me to this next very important report by Greg Reese, who has gone on the main line onto the mainland there in Asia, across from Hong Kong.
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.522]  The Chai Com's plan for Hong Kong invasion revealed.
[00:10:19.542 --> 00:10:22.664]  We're going to be going to that here in just a few minutes.
[00:10:22.684 --> 00:10:31.310]  There's a bunch of other stunning reports we're going to be premiering here that will then be posted to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:34.113]  So there's a lot coming up.
[00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:39.538]  Also, it captured the public's imagination of what's going on over the weekend.
[00:10:39.578 --> 00:10:52.012]  I haven't really covered it yet because it's old news for us, but I want to give you the rest of the story about how the government says you should set your thermostat to 80-something degrees at night to save the Earth and save the planet.
[00:10:52.292 --> 00:10:54.595]  The idea that carbon dioxide is bad, it's actually good.
[00:10:55.831 --> 00:11:03.737]  Again, if you liquefied, I was just talking to Zach off-air about it, and it's true, if you liquefied all the CO2 in the atmosphere down, it'd be less than an inch.
[00:11:04.857 --> 00:11:09.321]  It was liquefied, I mean, it's one of the most trace gases out there, essential for life.
[00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:10.762]  Didn't have it, we'd all die.
[00:11:11.082 --> 00:11:12.363]  Plants would not put out oxygen.
[00:11:13.424 --> 00:11:15.765]  So, that's what's going on.
[00:11:16.246 --> 00:11:18.627]  First they said 80-something degrees, now they're saying 78 degrees.
[00:11:18.647 --> 00:11:20.909]  They're trying to walk it back because of the backlash.
[00:11:22.534 --> 00:11:31.976]  But remember, they told us 10 years ago, oh, the smart meters will turn your thermostat down for you at night, and your smartphones will interface with it and track what you're doing.
[00:11:32.877 --> 00:11:37.878]  And the government then, under Obama, was saying, we'll just do this without you consenting.
[00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:43.459]  So, the public's mad about the government telling them to set their thermostat to 82.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.380]  Then they walked it back to, you know, 78.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.460]  No, no, no.
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:49.261]  It goes well beyond that.
[00:11:50.455 --> 00:11:57.961]  Where already you can't send memeworld.com or infowars.com on WhatsApp that Facebook bought.
[00:11:58.361 --> 00:12:00.483]  So just a few months ago, CNN was calling for it.
[00:12:01.084 --> 00:12:03.926]  Now they're not letting you text someone in the private messenger.
[00:12:04.386 --> 00:12:05.587]  They're reading what you're saying.
[00:12:06.188 --> 00:12:06.928]  They're tracking you.
[00:12:06.989 --> 00:12:07.469]  It's criminal.
[00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:08.550]  It's beyond the NSA.
[00:12:10.591 --> 00:12:18.058]  Now we're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back after we play this report with Greg Reese and give you a spectrum of today's broadcast.
[00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:23.038]  Please remember, without you, we won't be here, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:12:23.378 --> 00:12:26.061]  But really, these are products that are excellent, so you need them regardless.
[00:12:27.342 --> 00:12:39.953]  They're all top of the line, whether it's our Wake Up America coffee, or whether it's our fluoride-free toothpaste, fortified with a little silver iodine, or whether it's t-shirts, or books, or films, it all gets the word out, it all spreads liberty, and it all funds this operation, and it all helps your body.
[00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:48.195]  And it's the last weekend of the extended sale that was the store-wide super sale, but a bunch of stuff got close to selling out or sold out.
[00:12:48.475 --> 00:12:53.899]  So now it's a whole bunch of select items, 50 to 60% off, and then fullmorestore.com.
[00:12:55.621 --> 00:12:58.763]  And that makes our entire broadcast possible.
[00:13:00.705 --> 00:13:03.066]  Those specials will have to end by Sunday.
[00:13:03.567 --> 00:13:10.212]  We also have a new special and a new product that's been in for two weeks, but only went on sale today because I've been so busy.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:23.564]  I have not had time to come in and talk about this, even though it's one of the most exciting things we've ever done, and it's trailblazing, and it's groundbreaking, and that nobody else has.
[00:13:23.924 --> 00:13:28.085]  And it's from the top silver product producer in the country that's FDA approved.
[00:13:29.636 --> 00:13:34.697]  With their silver wound gel that's so popular, but very expensive to get patented and approved.
[00:13:35.197 --> 00:13:37.018]  So it's sold in stores for $40.
[00:13:37.418 --> 00:13:43.519]  We sell it for $29.95 and we even discount it more, but we have to spend a lot of money to get it because of the basic cost.
[00:13:43.539 --> 00:13:46.020]  We're the only private labeler of it in the country.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.540]  This is used in hospitals.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.301]  It's sold in stores under another name.
[00:13:50.861 --> 00:13:52.841]  They're patriots and they let us private label it.
[00:13:53.181 --> 00:13:53.901]  This is a big deal.
[00:13:53.921 --> 00:13:55.402]  100% product reviews.
[00:13:55.662 --> 00:13:56.102]  Well, guess what?
[00:13:57.529 --> 00:14:10.219]  Out of their factory, we said we want to put out skin creams that are high-quality nano-silver, but at a lower level, so it's safe to use all the time, mixed with hyaluronic acid and stuff that's known to be really good for your skin.
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.681]  Women all know about that.
[00:14:12.381 --> 00:14:17.185]  And we're putting out a price less than high-quality hyaluronic acid.
[00:14:17.926 --> 00:14:21.329]  And it's got all these other great things inside of it.
[00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:25.172]  And so, I don't have time right now to get into it.
[00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:31.656]  No reviews yet, but it is going to be very, very popular.
[00:14:31.836 --> 00:14:33.739]  And just please go read about it for yourself.
[00:14:34.299 --> 00:14:38.306]  We've got Super Silver Skin Cream from InfoWars Life.
[00:14:39.915 --> 00:14:42.156]  And we've got the super silver skin cream.
[00:14:42.176 --> 00:14:43.777]  We've got two different types of it.
[00:14:43.977 --> 00:14:44.718]  One is grapefruit.
[00:14:44.858 --> 00:14:46.779]  One is doesn't have the grapefruit.
[00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:52.722]  But anybody that knows about skin products and what this has got in it is going to be blown away and very, very excited.
[00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:59.446]  And it's something a lot of men don't think about taking care of your skin or putting this barrier up your skin to outside pathogens and things.
[00:14:59.506 --> 00:15:00.867]  But this is this is the way to go.
[00:15:01.947 --> 00:15:06.270]  And it is a fraction of the price of
[00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:11.315]  Super Silver Wound Dressing Gel because it's not FDA.
[00:15:11.335 --> 00:15:15.958]  It wasn't put out there as a drug from the same company with the same silver and all of it.
[00:15:16.258 --> 00:15:18.999]  But it's patented nano silver, all that stuff.
[00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:27.664]  But we're able to get it for a third of the price because it didn't have all the expensive FDA approval and all the patents and all the lawyers and all the stuff.
[00:15:27.684 --> 00:15:28.845]  So this is a big company.
[00:15:29.705 --> 00:15:31.146]  And they're doing this with us first.
[00:15:31.587 --> 00:15:34.669]  They plan, we're kind of like a market test, but we know it's going to blow people away.
[00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:42.516]  It's my dad's idea, Tim Frechet's idea, my idea, working with their people and top skincare experts about what's already best rated, what's best selling.
[00:15:42.876 --> 00:15:45.378]  So this is a whole new enchilada.
[00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:46.960]  It's a whole new world.
[00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:51.527]  And I believe it's going to end up being a national bestseller, not just here.
[00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:54.873]  And I believe it's going to fund us into taking the country and the world back.
[00:15:54.893 --> 00:15:56.035]  So please, check it out.
[00:15:56.075 --> 00:15:58.039]  The new products at InfoWorksTour.com.
[00:15:58.059 --> 00:15:59.181]  25% off as an introductory.
[00:15:59.221 --> 00:16:00.283]  We'll be back with the China report.
[00:16:04.913 --> 00:16:06.836]  I've known Alex for, like, more than 20 years.
[00:16:06.856 --> 00:16:07.817]  I've hung out with that guy.
[00:16:07.837 --> 00:16:09.499]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.382]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[00:16:11.462 --> 00:16:13.265]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein s***.
[00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:15.127]  That is a f***ing fact.
[00:16:15.307 --> 00:16:17.731]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:20.815]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:23.937]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[00:16:24.238 --> 00:16:27.260]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.322]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.
[00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:35.587]  Alex Jones supported President Trump but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[00:16:35.747 --> 00:16:40.711]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[00:16:40.871 --> 00:16:42.993]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just...
[00:16:43.513 --> 00:16:43.753]  Yeah.
[00:16:43.874 --> 00:16:46.036]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:16:46.236 --> 00:16:48.299]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:50.161]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:16:50.381 --> 00:16:54.166]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[00:16:54.246 --> 00:16:56.409]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:16:56.469 --> 00:16:59.412]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:16:59.713 --> 00:17:03.617]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[00:17:04.429 --> 00:17:11.174]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[00:17:11.374 --> 00:17:12.575]  The government's poisoning the water?
[00:17:12.995 --> 00:17:13.596]  Absolutely.
[00:17:13.616 --> 00:17:18.519]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.422]  Poisoning the water to dumb down the population to make them more easily manageable.
[00:17:22.962 --> 00:17:25.384]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one!
[00:17:25.584 --> 00:17:27.485]  He's fighting back against my takeover!
[00:17:27.825 --> 00:17:29.726]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[00:17:29.946 --> 00:17:33.008]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[00:17:33.168 --> 00:17:35.930]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:40.813]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[00:17:40.993 --> 00:17:42.934]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[00:17:43.134 --> 00:17:44.775]  Jones says there's a world government.
[00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:46.796]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[00:17:47.016 --> 00:17:47.317]  It is.
[00:17:47.337 --> 00:17:48.217]  On and on and on.
[00:17:48.777 --> 00:17:51.359]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[00:17:51.619 --> 00:17:57.462]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[00:17:58.603 --> 00:18:03.966]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Faruli, developed brain cancer.
[00:18:04.066 --> 00:18:07.347]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[00:18:07.808 --> 00:18:19.334]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[00:18:19.594 --> 00:18:35.927]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves, cell phones,
[00:18:36.207 --> 00:18:39.529]  Operate as microwave transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:40.749]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:42.810]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:47.913]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[00:18:47.933 --> 00:18:53.055]  That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[00:18:53.115 --> 00:18:53.756]  You heard me right.
[00:18:54.316 --> 00:18:56.557]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[00:18:57.057 --> 00:19:02.843]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[00:19:03.383 --> 00:19:16.456]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[00:19:17.176 --> 00:19:18.537]  What may have happened here?
[00:19:18.778 --> 00:19:21.680]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[00:19:22.401 --> 00:19:28.666]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[00:19:28.966 --> 00:19:38.173]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[00:19:38.454 --> 00:19:41.496]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[00:19:41.616 --> 00:19:43.578]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[00:19:43.858 --> 00:19:44.799]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[00:19:44.999 --> 00:19:47.401]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[00:19:47.881 --> 00:19:48.541]  Years ago.
[00:19:48.902 --> 00:19:56.227]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[00:19:56.308 --> 00:19:58.509]  He was talking about this years ago.
[00:19:58.629 --> 00:20:00.271]  Now it is mainstream news.
[00:20:06.375 --> 00:20:09.037]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:36.718 --> 00:20:40.701]  This is Greg Reese reporting from mainland China for InfoWars.com.
[00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:45.123]  Behind me here is the start of the HKZM Bridge.
[00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:57.331]  Opened less than one year ago, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is 34 miles long, consisting of three cable-stayed bridges, an undersea tunnel, and four artificial islands.
[00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:00.513]  It is the longest open-sea fixed link on Earth.
[00:21:00.973 --> 00:21:03.435]  The bridge links the mainland to Hong Kong.
[00:21:03.995 --> 00:21:07.439]  This is the bridge the Chai Kams are going to use to invade Hong Kong.
[00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:17.830]  Reporter Savannah Hernandez is reporting on the upcoming elections that are already fixed, where only one candidate who stands for Beijing rule over Macau is set to win the election.
[00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:22.916]  First comes Macau, second comes Hong Kong, and this is the breach.
[00:21:26.258 --> 00:21:33.406]  After World War II, we saw the rise of communism in the Soviet Union and in the People's Republic of China.
[00:21:35.848 --> 00:21:45.439]  In 1949, the Chinese Communist Revolution, led by Party Chairman Mao Zedong, was responsible for the murder of over 100 million Chinese.
[00:21:47.694 --> 00:22:00.559]  Millions of others fled the mainland into Taiwan and Hong Kong, which as a result, grew into thriving societies as mainland China plunged into darkness.
[00:22:01.179 --> 00:22:09.002]  2019, the 70-year anniversary of the Communist Revolution, and despite its horrors, communism continues to spread.
[00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:19.727]  The People's Republic is a model for globalized governance, and the Communist Chinese are now looking to absorb those who fled 70 years ago.
[00:22:19.747 --> 00:22:31.833]  100,000 troops of the CHICOM's paramilitary PAF are now training on the border of these autonomous cities, preparing for an invasion.
[00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:40.371]  And the people of Hong Kong are united against this tyrannical cancer.
[00:22:43.452 --> 00:22:47.253]  Right behind me is mainland China, separated by this small waterway.
[00:22:47.653 --> 00:22:56.795]  With over 100,000 troops already amassed, set to invade only a fraction of the people's armed force, the Chi-Coms are preparing for Tiananmen Square 2.0.
[00:22:58.816 --> 00:23:03.457]  Reporting from mainland China, for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:16.939]  Man, you look at those buildings, if you're a radio listener, the reports posted on Infowars.com and a whole bunch of other ones, looks like an alien base.
[00:23:18.361 --> 00:23:19.462]  And that's where all the U.S.
[00:23:19.522 --> 00:23:19.982]  money went.
[00:23:20.863 --> 00:23:30.032]  This $500 billion trade deficit every year for decades, the $300, $400 billion in stolen intellectual property, we're up at $800, $900 billion a year.
[00:23:30.573 --> 00:23:31.213]  That's where it all went.
[00:23:32.042 --> 00:23:34.483]  They've had dozens of times the development we've had.
[00:23:35.124 --> 00:23:36.645]  We can't fix any of our train tracks.
[00:23:36.705 --> 00:23:38.306]  Our trains go 40 miles an hour.
[00:23:39.426 --> 00:23:40.307]  My dad was a kid.
[00:23:40.327 --> 00:23:41.307]  They went 120 miles an hour.
[00:23:42.608 --> 00:23:44.689]  His mother could go to college, get her master's degree.
[00:23:44.709 --> 00:23:46.130]  I mean, he was a little kid.
[00:23:46.791 --> 00:23:52.494]  Shoot down from North Texas down to Houston in just an hour and a half, come back.
[00:23:54.235 --> 00:23:58.037]  Now that same train can't even go 40 miles an hour because the tracks aren't any good.
[00:23:58.518 --> 00:23:58.978]  It's incredible.
[00:23:59.778 --> 00:24:00.299]  You know, I've
[00:24:01.493 --> 00:24:12.196]  I've seen the articles out there and I've seen some of the comments on InfoWars that, oh, you're supporting the Pentagon, you're supporting Trump, you're supporting making it the 51st state, Hong Kong.
[00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:25.199]  No, I don't support dictators and the Communists took over China after we saved them from the Japanese in World War II, and our own State Department double-crossed our military, double-crossed
[00:24:26.175 --> 00:24:28.116]  John Birch, who was at U.S.
[00:24:28.156 --> 00:24:34.697]  intelligence, and he was radioing back that our government was working with the Chinese to the rest of our military.
[00:24:34.718 --> 00:24:37.438]  They tortured him and killed him and a lot of other U.S.
[00:24:37.518 --> 00:24:39.839]  agents, the State Department globalist criminals.
[00:24:41.459 --> 00:24:42.940]  Harry S. Truman was a monster.
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:45.081]  He made sure we lost the Korean War as well.
[00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:46.621]  The U.N.
[00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:47.341]  ran the whole thing.
[00:24:52.142 --> 00:24:54.323]  They then killed 100 plus million of their own people.
[00:24:54.463 --> 00:24:55.844]  They put them in forced labor camps.
[00:24:55.964 --> 00:25:00.087]  They've killed 50 million plus little girls on top of the 100 million.
[00:25:00.647 --> 00:25:03.629]  Many of them after they're born in the one-child policy.
[00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:09.113]  You count all the forced abortions and dead kids, it's over 165 million the Chinese have killed.
[00:25:09.133 --> 00:25:11.374]  But it's a hundred and something million adults.
[00:25:11.394 --> 00:25:12.115]  That's an admitted number.
[00:25:14.073 --> 00:25:19.076]  Taking off their little plots of land, the poor farmers, 90% of Chinese are poor farmers just like Americans.
[00:25:19.896 --> 00:25:28.361]  Marching them into slave camps to build this big thing for Armand Hammer and David Rockefeller and all them that became even more wealthy off of developing China.
[00:25:29.802 --> 00:25:38.107]  And it makes me sick to a level that's hard to describe and so you're damn right I support the free independent people of Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[00:25:39.656 --> 00:25:57.512]  Being autonomous and controlling their own country because they're the real Chinese that left and that were driven into those traditionally Chinese areas and who love China but hate the Communist Party that for 70 years has ruled a billion plus slaves.
[00:25:58.813 --> 00:25:59.414]  You think about that.
[00:26:00.835 --> 00:26:01.896]  Think about that long and hard.
[00:26:02.036 --> 00:26:03.517]  And so these are free people.
[00:26:04.451 --> 00:26:07.293]  That want to be out from under an unelected dictator.
[00:26:07.734 --> 00:26:10.295]  And our media calls Trump a dictator, and all this stuff.
[00:26:10.516 --> 00:26:15.019]  Meanwhile, Xi is a dictator, and our own media says he's the hero that will stop Trump.
[00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:17.041]  They've been saying it for two and a half years at Davos.
[00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:18.882]  They said two and a half years ago that he'll crush Trump.
[00:26:18.902 --> 00:26:30.231]  Let's go to another powerful report here, and we'll come back with the big news dealing with all of this, and that is Hong Kong united on the front line of the war against humanity.
[00:26:30.271 --> 00:26:30.551]  Here it is.
[00:26:32.375 --> 00:26:40.902]  Infowars is on the ground in Hong Kong and on Wednesday we went to one of the many protests that have been ongoing for 11 weeks.
[00:26:42.644 --> 00:26:50.010]  We spoke to protesters and we learned of the strange upside-down clown world that has taken over the United States.
[00:26:51.411 --> 00:26:59.013]  In the U.S., local communist organization Antifa wears all black and covers their faces with masks.
[00:27:00.174 --> 00:27:05.456]  They do this for intimidation and to hide their criminal activity from the police.
[00:27:07.236 --> 00:27:19.140]  Whereas the peaceful Hong Kong protesters wear masks to hide their identities from QICOM face scanners that could lead to their arrest, persecution, and torture.
[00:27:21.229 --> 00:27:34.403]  They wear black to stand out from the non-protesters, to protect them from the police, so that in the event that protesters are targeted for police harassment, their fellow Hong Kongers will not be abused.
[00:27:37.627 --> 00:27:43.113]  In the U.S., many burn the American flag while waving the flag of communism.
[00:27:44.321 --> 00:27:53.024]  In Hong Kong, they wave the American flag as a symbol of independence to free themselves from the growing threat of communist control.
[00:27:55.524 --> 00:28:04.887]  In the U.S., professors assault American patriots with bike locks, support Antifa, and call for chaos and violence.
[00:28:06.266 --> 00:28:16.195]  In Hong Kong, the teachers lecture about the values of independence, the evils of communism, and they join together with their students in the protests.
[00:28:17.616 --> 00:28:26.323]  Witnessing all this as an American in Hong Kong, the contrast between their culture and ours is blatantly apparent.
[00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:33.790]  Almost half of America is now embracing socialism, the inevitable gateway to communism.
[00:28:34.844 --> 00:28:35.844]  Those videos are on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:02.847 --> 00:29:10.712]  I think that with the Trump election, in fact with elections all across the world, starting with Modi in India, we had the upper hand.
[00:29:12.974 --> 00:29:14.455]  Through social media we had the upper hand.
[00:29:15.836 --> 00:29:21.700]  For years, the media and the government and the establishment have been able to dictate what people think and how they think.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.361]  Now all of a sudden people can give their own voice.
[00:29:25.462 --> 00:29:29.265]  And now the establishment are trying to take back the power.
[00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:31.828]  And that's what you're witnessing.
[00:29:31.848 --> 00:29:37.939]  Before, if a politician or someone said something about me on Twitter, I'd go on and I'd comment and I'd put them right about the lies they're telling.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.682]  Right now, there's no way to do that.
[00:29:40.483 --> 00:29:41.124]  They're allowed to lie.
[00:29:41.912 --> 00:29:45.575]  And then there's many comments underneath it, and no one gets to see the other side of the story.
[00:29:46.135 --> 00:29:47.797]  You don't get a right to reply on any of it.
[00:29:48.097 --> 00:29:50.159]  And that's what their sole intention was.
[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.222]  So that they, again, could have the power to tell people who you are.
[00:29:54.542 --> 00:30:02.308]  Right now, anyone on Twitter can tell the public on Twitter, or the people on Twitter, who I am, what I stand for, without me having an opportunity to put them right on the lies they're telling.
[00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.071]  And it's simply not right, it's not fair, and the public see that.
[00:30:06.712 --> 00:30:09.294]  They shouldn't be able to censor or delete people from everyday life.
[00:30:09.414 --> 00:30:09.975]  That's what they're doing.
[00:30:10.859 --> 00:30:12.140]  It's part of society.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:20.244]  And if you're deleted off of Facebook, off of Instagram, off of Twitter, off of YouTube, it's like you're removed from society.
[00:30:21.304 --> 00:30:22.625]  They shouldn't be allowed to do that.
[00:30:22.745 --> 00:30:28.608]  There should be some sort of Bill of Rights from media giants and tech giants that should prevent them from doing that.
[00:30:29.168 --> 00:30:31.289]  If people aren't committing crimes, we have laws.
[00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:34.471]  We have many laws in this country to prevent people from muting hatred.
[00:30:34.971 --> 00:30:36.792]  If I was breaching any of those laws, I'd be arrested.
[00:30:37.552 --> 00:30:38.813]  So I'm not promoting any hate.
[00:30:39.373 --> 00:30:43.816]  You're just using, you're using that word in order to remove people.
[00:30:43.916 --> 00:30:47.037]  No one has given me... PayPal couldn't give me an example of why they've removed me.
[00:30:47.858 --> 00:30:51.040]  Twitter's example was irrelevant because it was a fact.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:52.820]  I wasn't even given my opinion.
[00:30:53.321 --> 00:30:53.941]  It was a fact.
[00:30:54.621 --> 00:30:59.404]  And then one of the other tweets that they'd already previously warned me for was saying that Islam promotes killing people.
[00:30:59.984 --> 00:31:03.907]  Every imam in the world would agree that Islam promotes killing people.
[00:31:04.627 --> 00:31:05.988]  It promotes murder and war.
[00:31:07.216 --> 00:31:07.617]  That's a fact.
[00:31:08.297 --> 00:31:08.898]  That's not hatred.
[00:31:08.918 --> 00:31:09.999]  That's factual.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:19.270]  So I was released from prison by the highest judge in the country who accepted that everything that happened was unlawful, that I hadn't even been asked to plead guilty and not guilty.
[00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:23.094]  So I was released from prison, but I was released pending another trial.
[00:31:23.995 --> 00:31:39.448]  Um, I then went to the Old Bailey three times, and then it went before the head judge of the Old Bailey, where I wrote out a letter the night before, where I listed all of the unlawful things they were still doing, and the evidence that I'd give would expose all of these things.
[00:31:39.748 --> 00:31:46.434]  So, and then when that judge read that, the day he was due to start the trial, he refused to start the trial, and he sent it back to the government.
[00:31:47.535 --> 00:31:49.016]  So then it's been with the Attorney General.
[00:31:49.497 --> 00:31:56.101]  Now one week before I went, before Christmas, I was sent a letter and an email by the Attorney General saying that they were reviewing further charges.
[00:31:56.862 --> 00:32:01.666]  I believe this is being left hanging over me in order to act as some sort of mental torture.
[00:32:05.388 --> 00:32:08.010]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:12.013]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:32:12.874 --> 00:32:13.875]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:32:16.946 --> 00:32:18.627]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.692]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[00:32:24.712 --> 00:32:25.773]  It's a form of fascism.
[00:32:25.793 --> 00:32:30.357]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[00:32:30.457 --> 00:32:37.182]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:32:41.786 --> 00:32:45.229]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.640]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:32:57.341 --> 00:32:58.362]  You can't watch this!
[00:32:58.702 --> 00:33:09.025]  The movie available now at InfowarsStore.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:22.443 --> 00:33:26.306]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:26.866 --> 00:33:30.689]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:39.975 --> 00:33:42.437]  They had a hit show come out.
[00:33:43.157 --> 00:33:43.858]  Sandra Bullock.
[00:33:46.179 --> 00:33:46.840]  Bird Box.
[00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:49.262]  Seems like a million years ago.
[00:33:49.282 --> 00:33:50.743]  It was only, what, like a year ago or less.
[00:33:51.883 --> 00:33:56.306]  And everybody watched it and they said, what is this show about?
[00:33:56.366 --> 00:33:57.107]  Is it aliens?
[00:33:57.147 --> 00:33:57.467]  What is it?
[00:33:57.607 --> 00:34:00.749]  No one, no one, no one said cell phones.
[00:34:02.551 --> 00:34:04.812]  But it's as clear as the nose on somebody's face.
[00:34:04.832 --> 00:34:09.816]  But see, people are so habituated to cell phones, they think of them as safe, their little friend.
[00:34:09.836 --> 00:34:12.478]  They give it more attention than their newborn baby.
[00:34:13.558 --> 00:34:14.659]  It's the center of their life.
[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.821]  It's a literal crystal ball.
[00:34:17.221 --> 00:34:19.803]  They can dial into the whole world and see things, but
[00:34:21.271 --> 00:34:25.374]  Be careful because there's other people watching through your phone.
[00:34:25.674 --> 00:34:25.914]  You.
[00:34:27.255 --> 00:34:28.396]  You wouldn't live in a glass house.
[00:34:28.456 --> 00:34:30.618]  You wouldn't not have screen doors.
[00:34:31.098 --> 00:34:34.700]  But you don't have any gates.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.722]  And it's all been psychologically tested.
[00:34:38.703 --> 00:34:45.308]  It's the plan by the technocrats to habituate you to take brain chips.
[00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:52.956]  Because you'll only be able to use your cell phones and interface with 5G in the future if you have the chip.
[00:34:53.977 --> 00:34:54.838]  But it's beyond a chip.
[00:34:54.898 --> 00:35:05.249]  It's a neural network of wires plugged into your brain that Elon Musk says go on sale in less than five months.
[00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.092]  See, this isn't Alex Jones warning you 25 years ago.
[00:35:11.795 --> 00:35:18.360]  Or when I was five years old, sitting there in an evangelical church in Dallas, Texas, hearing about all this.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:23.183]  The one world government in Brussels, and a computer called the Beast.
[00:35:23.823 --> 00:35:33.910]  And now everybody will have wires in their heads, and then if you don't do what the government and the system says, they won't let you buy or sell, because everything you do will be tracked by a worldwide computer system with satellites.
[00:35:34.451 --> 00:35:37.253]  And you'll have a digital mark in your forehead and hand.
[00:35:37.273 --> 00:35:40.235]  And I'm sitting there hearing this, and then it all comes true.
[00:35:42.654 --> 00:35:44.214]  But don't listen to those people!
[00:35:46.395 --> 00:35:51.217]  Plus, they've all since been bought off, and fake preachers put on TV to discredit it all.
[00:35:53.177 --> 00:36:00.019]  But there was a 2,000-year-old warning, a transmission, given to John, the Revelator.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.340]  Angel tells him, take this.
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:04.460]  Takes it.
[00:36:04.841 --> 00:36:05.961]  Another dimension.
[00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:09.222]  He's now in communication for a couple days, having that vision.
[00:36:10.273 --> 00:36:13.235]  He wasn't talking to some DMT demon, either.
[00:36:14.016 --> 00:36:15.777]  He was talking to the big guy.
[00:36:19.019 --> 00:36:19.259]  Yeah.
[00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.840]  That's how this works.
[00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:24.263]  So, let's get real serious about it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:24.283 --> 00:36:25.864]  We've been given a transmission.
[00:36:27.565 --> 00:36:30.908]  We've been warned with an interdimensional transmission.
[00:36:31.268 --> 00:36:31.888]  That's what this is.
[00:36:32.369 --> 00:36:33.449]  Take a look where you're at, folks.
[00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:34.990]  You're on a planet in deep space.
[00:36:35.271 --> 00:36:36.772]  People don't think they know where we came from.
[00:36:36.892 --> 00:36:38.133]  We've been told we know.
[00:36:39.093 --> 00:36:39.774]  But we have free will.
[00:36:41.598 --> 00:36:53.767]  So the Creator says to his children, I have to do this to you because you are capable, as Gandhi accurately said, to be the seed of a whole other universe.
[00:36:53.947 --> 00:36:55.348]  That's really our potentiality.
[00:36:59.171 --> 00:37:03.794]  Communion with God is to come up, not to the level, but in the same league.
[00:37:04.534 --> 00:37:05.435]  We're not gods now.
[00:37:05.715 --> 00:37:06.736]  The Satanists say all that.
[00:37:07.417 --> 00:37:10.639]  But you know it to be true at some level that you have the potentiality
[00:37:12.329 --> 00:37:13.210]  Because who made you?
[00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:15.211]  The imprint, the seal.
[00:37:16.652 --> 00:37:19.794]  But with that potentiality is free will.
[00:37:20.154 --> 00:37:21.695]  You must be given choices.
[00:37:22.596 --> 00:37:25.197]  And God's children, he says, I love the sparrow so much.
[00:37:25.637 --> 00:37:26.398]  Sparrow of the field.
[00:37:27.158 --> 00:37:30.501]  Think how much more I love you to have to put your children through this.
[00:37:30.701 --> 00:37:32.462]  Just like when you have a child with your wife or husband.
[00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:34.421]  You're giving them life.
[00:37:35.061 --> 00:37:36.182]  You're giving them love.
[00:37:36.202 --> 00:37:37.023]  You're giving them pain.
[00:37:37.043 --> 00:37:38.744]  You're giving them all the experiences.
[00:37:39.224 --> 00:37:51.114]  You're giving them, when they're 60 years old or 80 years old or dying of cancer and incredible pain, but all the pleasure, all the goodness, all the consciousness, all the reality, you did just like God did.
[00:37:52.695 --> 00:37:53.616]  As above, so below.
[00:37:55.337 --> 00:37:56.498]  We're made in the image of God.
[00:37:57.138 --> 00:38:02.903]  And the churches don't like you to know that, because the Luciferians saw the lie that you're already God and all those lies.
[00:38:04.346 --> 00:38:05.006]  No, you're falling.
[00:38:06.187 --> 00:38:08.848]  And then you've got the church saying, oh no, no, that's misinterpreted.
[00:38:08.948 --> 00:38:09.188]  No.
[00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:12.130]  Look at what we've already built, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:18.293 --> 00:38:19.713]  But they're being honest about AI.
[00:38:19.813 --> 00:38:24.396]  When you turn yourself over to it, that Elon Musk giggles and says you will, it's suicide.
[00:38:26.196 --> 00:38:27.637]  But it's not suicide over the body.
[00:38:29.178 --> 00:38:31.059]  It's suicide over the soul.
[00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:35.245]  If you willfully turn yourself over to that.
[00:38:35.645 --> 00:38:39.127]  So I'll get into the technicals here in a moment of this.
[00:38:39.387 --> 00:38:45.190]  And then the technicals are not my hypothesis that we all know is true.
[00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.192]  Because it's the truth.
[00:38:47.452 --> 00:38:48.152]  Everyone already knows it.
[00:38:48.472 --> 00:38:49.393]  Every culture already knew it.
[00:38:49.993 --> 00:38:51.114]  It's manifest all around you.
[00:38:53.783 --> 00:39:10.811]  I mean, you read Ezekiel, it's like spaceships land, and dudes are floating on deals with, like, blue firmaments over their heads, you know, space helmets, and they're, like, take this, and they'll... I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on around here, folks, that isn't on the UFO channel.
[00:39:11.371 --> 00:39:13.452]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[00:39:13.812 --> 00:39:21.316]  God's workers, the angels, who don't procreate, because they're not living.
[00:39:22.376 --> 00:39:23.097]  They were made.
[00:39:23.956 --> 00:39:32.018]  And then God tried to make one, not in failure, knowing he'd be the tester, that was given free will, so it's a robot.
[00:39:32.398 --> 00:39:41.281]  That's why Satan keeps creating silicon life forms and tells his minions, you can only transcend when you give up your body and die.
[00:39:41.601 --> 00:39:47.383]  All their statements are, you will merge with machines, you will live forever, but your physical body must die.
[00:39:47.683 --> 00:39:48.343]  It's a con game.
[00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:53.710]  You'll be absorbed into it and it won't be who you really were.
[00:39:53.730 --> 00:40:03.979]  It'll be the counterfeit facsimile of all the learned knowledge of your genetic past and what you experienced in this test, because Satan's trying to become humanity.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:09.663]  He's saying, join with the machines, you'll become God, because he's not God.
[00:40:09.904 --> 00:40:15.889]  He's trying to merge with us to become the stairway to heaven to try to approach God.
[00:40:18.427 --> 00:40:20.067]  And that's the big mega secret.
[00:40:20.828 --> 00:40:24.969]  And that's what even the highest level Luciferians have been deceived on.
[00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:32.111]  You will only transcend through free will choosing God.
[00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:38.693]  And the spirit, the program, the electrochemical system that Christ brought.
[00:40:40.629 --> 00:41:06.671]  And God, through, they're telling you, they already know, through that avatar, coming down to Earth, because if God was going to put us through that, God, that incredible all-knowing consciousness that created all of this, focused down to show us, if I'm going to send you through boot camp, if I'm going to send you through budge trading, if I'm going to send you through the ranger program, if I'm going to make you do all of this, I'm going to show you how it's done.
[00:41:13.266 --> 00:41:14.247]  Isn't that amazing?
[00:41:14.667 --> 00:41:17.189]  And everyone listening knows that's the truth.
[00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:19.511]  It's why they're so scared of Christians.
[00:41:19.811 --> 00:41:21.012]  It's why they wanted to eradicate it.
[00:41:21.433 --> 00:41:23.794]  Because it's an ongoing transmission.
[00:41:26.416 --> 00:41:35.223]  They've got all their radio telescopes and all their things trying to find God, trying to find whatever, because they already know that God's already here.
[00:41:35.924 --> 00:41:36.985]  Already through the ether.
[00:41:37.785 --> 00:41:38.706]  All through the dimensions.
[00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:42.069]  Across all galaxies, all dimensions.
[00:41:45.658 --> 00:41:46.978]  And that's what this test is.
[00:41:47.038 --> 00:41:52.580]  So, they can do fiber optic that causes no radiation to speak of.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.240]  It's light.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.060]  Light energy.
[00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:55.881]  No radiation to humans.
[00:41:56.501 --> 00:42:00.082]  That's 500, 1,000 times better than broadcast.
[00:42:00.122 --> 00:42:01.482]  Broadcast is dirty.
[00:42:01.582 --> 00:42:04.463]  It picks up other transmissions from space.
[00:42:05.183 --> 00:42:06.404]  It's bad for our cells.
[00:42:07.624 --> 00:42:08.444]  But they want it.
[00:42:08.644 --> 00:42:08.924]  Why?
[00:42:09.124 --> 00:42:11.185]  Because you don't have a decision.
[00:42:13.612 --> 00:42:16.373]  With regular television or radio, you dial to the frequency.
[00:42:17.014 --> 00:42:19.014]  It's still a radiation transmission.
[00:42:19.455 --> 00:42:22.576]  With a digital receiver picking it up, think about your cells picking it up.
[00:42:22.696 --> 00:42:30.420]  It's billions of times weaker than the aggregate of the cell towers and the 5G that will blast through stone and wood.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.782]  You won't be able to hide from it and we'll get control of everything you do and track you.
[00:42:35.002 --> 00:42:37.143]  But if everyone had to plug into something,
[00:42:38.459 --> 00:42:43.625]  They can have plugs everywhere and then have data they wouldn't have control when you unplug.
[00:42:44.406 --> 00:42:47.350]  So see, they want full control where they're always in your devices.
[00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:48.411]  There's no way to hide.
[00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:52.256]  It's an attempt to be God with a false electronic omnipresence.
[00:42:52.456 --> 00:42:53.637]  But there's much more to know.
[00:42:54.478 --> 00:42:57.742]  And I will reveal it and how to stop it on the other side.
[00:43:07.825 --> 00:43:11.571]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[00:43:11.611 --> 00:43:13.814]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[00:43:14.034 --> 00:43:14.896]  This is not a movie.
[00:43:14.916 --> 00:43:15.717]  This is not a drill.
[00:43:15.777 --> 00:43:16.618]  This is not fiction.
[00:43:17.079 --> 00:43:18.381]  This is reality.
[00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:25.864]  You have a major Google engineer backing up what the other engineers have said, what the documents have shown, and talking about perjury before Congress.
[00:43:26.024 --> 00:43:29.107]  Pray and support this individual and others to come forward.
[00:43:29.147 --> 00:43:30.568]  So, Zach Voorhees, we salute you.
[00:43:30.648 --> 00:43:32.549]  And I'll say this, it's all of our birthright.
[00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:38.313]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight, whether you're from San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, Texas, or Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:43:38.373 --> 00:43:40.535]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[00:43:40.555 --> 00:43:45.539]  We're seeing election meddling, and it's time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor.
[00:43:45.899 --> 00:43:46.039]  I think?
[00:44:01.863 --> 00:44:06.564]  We wouldn't have withstood this withering storm of censorship, attacks, and lies.
[00:44:06.684 --> 00:44:12.046]  We have the new World Awakens Mega Sale Globalist House of Cards Collapsing End of Summer Super Sale.
[00:44:12.166 --> 00:44:21.948]  It's the big, giant 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, but only on 50-something items, not on every item, because a bunch of these are very close to selling out.
[00:44:22.048 --> 00:44:31.850]  Whether it's Ultimate Krill Oil, Body's Turmeric, Brain Force Plus, Knockout Sleep Aid, Turbo Force, 8-Pack Power Stack, it's all 50-60% off, and your purchases make it all possible here.
[00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:43.812]  But an incredible time to be alive, an incredible time to be making history together, and standing up and seeing the good guys wake up, and to see us coming back from zero to basically tying the Globalists right now, for a football analogy.
[00:44:44.012 --> 00:44:46.293]  So back to Owen Schroer and Zach Voorhees.
[00:44:46.553 --> 00:44:49.354]  Do you think Google is the biggest threat to U.S.
[00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:49.815]  elections?
[00:44:50.295 --> 00:44:57.539]  I think that, you know, if you want to look at the biggest threat, it's Google together with Facebook, together with Twitter.
[00:44:57.719 --> 00:45:09.165]  They formed this echo chamber in which if they want to apply their control of narratives, then what they're going to do is they're going to press down the voices.
[00:45:09.725 --> 00:45:12.587]  But they don't want, and they're going to boost up the voices that they do.
[00:45:12.648 --> 00:45:17.051]  And InfoWars has been sort of the main victim in this.
[00:45:17.672 --> 00:45:30.142]  And it's clear that if your audience looks through the disclosure list posted at ProjectVeritas.com, they're going to see InfoWars pop up in numerous blacklists that have been disclosed.
[00:45:30.322 --> 00:45:35.744]  Google's mission statement is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
[00:45:35.884 --> 00:45:41.205]  When InfoWars was taken offline, was that making information universally accessible and useful?
[00:45:41.225 --> 00:45:41.865]  No, it wasn't.
[00:45:42.105 --> 00:45:48.607]  What do you think comes next in this disclosure of what Google is doing to manipulate U.S.
[00:45:48.667 --> 00:45:49.268]  elections?
[00:45:49.768 --> 00:45:53.809]  And what would you like to say to the Google executives that are engaging in this?
[00:45:55.341 --> 00:45:57.604]  Yeah, well, something quite amazing is happening right now.
[00:45:57.784 --> 00:45:59.545]  Like, there's been a huge document dump.
[00:45:59.585 --> 00:46:04.850]  I've released over 950 pages, and right now there is a crowd raid.
[00:46:05.831 --> 00:46:14.799]  There are a bunch of users, they're looking at these documents, they're digesting them, and they're posting the content of them onto Twitter for us all to see.
[00:46:14.819 --> 00:46:20.445]  And so, you know, one of the things I want to invite for your audience is to come online,
[00:46:21.025 --> 00:46:24.346]  You know, go to Project Veritas, see their disclosure.
[00:46:24.366 --> 00:46:26.247]  They posted a link to all these documents.
[00:46:26.407 --> 00:46:31.109]  I'm asking your audience to download the everything.zip file and just go to town.
[00:46:31.249 --> 00:46:36.071]  And the thing is, is that whatever you think Google's doing, I promise you, it's way, way worse.
[00:46:36.271 --> 00:46:41.173]  And, you know, I see the reaction online and everyone's like, you know, WTF?
[00:46:41.213 --> 00:46:41.793]  WTF?
[00:46:41.933 --> 00:46:47.095]  And I'm like, yes, everyone is now seeing what I've seen, uh, privately.
[00:46:47.115 --> 00:46:48.656]  Uh, and, you know,
[00:46:49.176 --> 00:46:57.899]  We're finally having the exposure of light into the darkness and people are finally understanding what's really going on in America.
[00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:09.064]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:31.676 --> 00:47:36.020]  So I've gotten into the big picture and what the establishment even believes.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.782]  They think they've sided with the right entity.
[00:47:40.283 --> 00:47:41.364]  None of these people are atheists.
[00:47:41.924 --> 00:47:45.467]  And you've seen Elon Musk and a bunch of them come out and say no.
[00:47:45.487 --> 00:47:52.373]  They're worshipping some entity they believe interdimensionally is communicating with them to build this AI system that's going to take us to the next level.
[00:47:52.973 --> 00:47:56.896]  It's the same transmission that Agnes C. Clarke was getting.
[00:47:57.853 --> 00:48:04.979]  He was a big Illuminist and of course he wrote Childhood's End and a bunch of other books that repeat that message that there's an entity communicating with us.
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.743]  In his original, in 2001, it's Lucifer is the name of the star.
[00:48:09.763 --> 00:48:11.464]  They have to go to Lucifer.
[00:48:11.845 --> 00:48:13.166]  They have to ignite Lucifer.
[00:48:13.946 --> 00:48:17.770]  They have to basically have sex with Lucifer spiritually to create the star child.
[00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:22.213]  And then that is the superior creature that will be allowed to live.
[00:48:22.293 --> 00:48:24.095]  So I'm not the one coming up with this.
[00:48:24.775 --> 00:48:26.537]  I'm telling you what they're all into.
[00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:34.810]  Elon Musk kind of freaked out three years ago, two years ago, and then they tried to tank his company, and George Soros bought a big piece of it.
[00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:39.193]  Now he's like, next year, bring your kids into the mall, we'll put a bunch of wires in their brain.
[00:48:40.014 --> 00:48:48.020]  So, we could talk all day long about 5G and how we don't want it, and how mainstream news even admits, oh yeah, it's really high radiation.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.281]  Even regular cell phones give you brain cancer.
[00:48:51.102 --> 00:48:56.306]  And I talked about this when I was in, because I got all these articles, but isn't anecdotal better?
[00:48:57.366 --> 00:49:00.609]  We're sitting there at dinner, and my wife's already asleep because I've been working late.
[00:49:00.629 --> 00:49:02.390]  And she's with the kids.
[00:49:03.391 --> 00:49:07.814]  And I'm out with Drew, the camera guy, and we're eating dinner.
[00:49:09.456 --> 00:49:12.338]  And I go, whoa!
[00:49:12.778 --> 00:49:17.782]  My cell phone just beamed, not just regular heat, but I could feel heat right through my hand.
[00:49:17.842 --> 00:49:18.543]  It's a real feeling.
[00:49:19.143 --> 00:49:21.766]  And I go, it only happens sometimes, but it's like powerful.
[00:49:22.046 --> 00:49:23.727]  And I pull up the diagram on it.
[00:49:23.747 --> 00:49:25.789]  I said, yeah, this is where the, um,
[00:49:27.284 --> 00:49:29.486]  Transmitter is, the microwave transmitter.
[00:49:30.707 --> 00:49:31.487]  And I said, feel this.
[00:49:31.968 --> 00:49:36.671]  And I said, it's not as hot as it was a minute ago, but still, he put his hand, not on the screen, but over it.
[00:49:36.691 --> 00:49:38.092]  He goes, whoa, I can feel the heat.
[00:49:38.773 --> 00:49:39.813]  And it was shooting out.
[00:49:39.833 --> 00:49:43.436]  Now, I don't know if that's a malfunction.
[00:49:43.576 --> 00:49:49.601]  I don't know if they're doing it on purpose, because they can obviously, it's declassified, oscillate it to control human behavior.
[00:49:49.641 --> 00:49:50.321]  That's old news.
[00:49:50.641 --> 00:49:51.982]  Stipend cell phones and mind control.
[00:49:53.584 --> 00:49:55.365]  Cell phone radiation and behavioral control.
[00:49:55.385 --> 00:49:56.506]  I mean, it's patents.
[00:49:59.335 --> 00:50:09.019]  And again, I'm sitting there this morning, and I reach across to give orange juice to my middle daughter, and it's burning me.
[00:50:09.039 --> 00:50:12.680]  I don't know if they're trying to kill me with it or what, but it's like, and I go, whoa, and it's like hot.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:16.262]  And I made the decision right there, no matter how useful these damn things are.
[00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:19.011]  Because technology's fine, but it's what they jack it with.
[00:50:19.051 --> 00:50:19.752]  I've got to get rid of it.
[00:50:19.972 --> 00:50:23.274]  I've got to at least start having weekends free, no cell phones, go back to landlines.
[00:50:23.314 --> 00:50:23.715]  We're doing it.
[00:50:23.935 --> 00:50:24.796]  They're all going away.
[00:50:24.816 --> 00:50:25.676]  They're all getting locked up.
[00:50:26.036 --> 00:50:28.258]  Every day when I get home, I'm done with them.
[00:50:28.478 --> 00:50:31.240]  And a lot of smart folks like Matt Druggs, years ago, you'll refuse to have them.
[00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:38.646]  Because they're a little portable, super high-tech computer with more tech in this than, you know, 30 years ago could be in a 10-story building.
[00:50:40.207 --> 00:50:41.228]  And it knows your heartbeat.
[00:50:41.268 --> 00:50:42.128]  It already knows everything.
[00:50:42.168 --> 00:50:43.389]  It's listening to you all the time.
[00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:45.571]  This is your little digital minder.
[00:50:47.305 --> 00:50:48.706]  It might as well be a chip in your brain.
[00:50:48.766 --> 00:50:50.167]  It's already frying your brain.
[00:50:50.207 --> 00:50:51.268]  It's already giving you cancer.
[00:50:52.409 --> 00:50:55.091]  And so, I always say I'm a hypocrite.
[00:50:55.231 --> 00:50:56.873]  I admit things are bad, then I still do them.
[00:50:59.414 --> 00:51:00.976]  But if you're a radio listener, you're not seeing this.
[00:51:01.096 --> 00:51:02.837]  Mind control by cell phone.
[00:51:02.917 --> 00:51:03.778]  Scientific American.
[00:51:03.818 --> 00:51:05.119]  I mean, this is not my opinion.
[00:51:05.659 --> 00:51:07.661]  People keep saying, why is it all coming out?
[00:51:07.801 --> 00:51:08.762]  Why are you right about everything?
[00:51:09.902 --> 00:51:13.025]  Because it was all in the medical and scientific literature 50 years ago.
[00:51:15.282 --> 00:51:15.622]  On average.
[00:51:15.922 --> 00:51:17.343]  They're about 45 years ahead.
[00:51:18.844 --> 00:51:20.945]  From the research and development to when they deploy it to us.
[00:51:20.985 --> 00:51:22.466]  And when they deploy it, it's always bad.
[00:51:23.646 --> 00:51:25.007]  It's always the worst possible thing.
[00:51:25.127 --> 00:51:26.668]  It doesn't just destroy your attention span.
[00:51:26.968 --> 00:51:29.189]  It doesn't just, in studies, make you feel like you don't have friends and family.
[00:51:29.389 --> 00:51:30.390]  It doesn't just make you depressed.
[00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:31.430]  It doesn't just surveil on you.
[00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.211]  It doesn't just kill you and give you cancer.
[00:51:35.932 --> 00:51:40.655]  It manipulates all of us and knows our dreams so they can always be ahead of us with trends.
[00:51:42.048 --> 00:51:42.828]  It's our warden.
[00:51:42.928 --> 00:51:43.789]  It's our jail guard.
[00:51:44.189 --> 00:51:45.209]  It's our slave master.
[00:51:45.289 --> 00:51:45.989]  It's our king.
[00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:47.010]  It's our God.
[00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:49.511]  It's our mommy and our daddy.
[00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:52.192]  We spend more time with it than we do with our newborn babies.
[00:51:54.812 --> 00:51:59.234]  And so this week and last week, I was talking about the heat coming off the thing.
[00:52:00.154 --> 00:52:00.995]  So I went and got another one.
[00:52:04.716 --> 00:52:05.116]  On Monday.
[00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:09.959]  Again, this bastard did it.
[00:52:10.599 --> 00:52:11.680]  Was it today or yesterday?
[00:52:12.561 --> 00:52:12.821]  Again.
[00:52:12.841 --> 00:52:16.143]  Because I know heat when I feel it.
[00:52:16.344 --> 00:52:19.206]  You're like, whoa, it's beaming.
[00:52:20.467 --> 00:52:26.091]  It's got some pulse power where it's got like a real microwave, like you're inside a microwave.
[00:52:26.111 --> 00:52:27.932]  And that takes power to go, whoa.
[00:52:27.972 --> 00:52:29.614]  That's what they've always said.
[00:52:29.634 --> 00:52:32.035]  They can remotely kill people they don't like, I guess, with these.
[00:52:32.336 --> 00:52:35.178]  So I think at an instinctive level, I have to just get rid of them completely.
[00:52:36.104 --> 00:52:42.649]  Because it's slow killing us, but if they want to, and there's been reports on this, they can kill you quickly with 5G particularly.
[00:52:44.751 --> 00:52:47.593]  But this baby is hot in the air when it happens.
[00:52:48.154 --> 00:52:51.596]  And it's not buzzing, nobody's calling, it's just hot.
[00:52:51.937 --> 00:52:53.098]  Everybody, check this for yourselves.
[00:52:54.259 --> 00:52:54.939]  It's amazing.
[00:52:55.199 --> 00:52:57.721]  I mean, it hurts, like, ooh, through my body.
[00:52:57.902 --> 00:52:58.862]  It's a pain I never felt.
[00:52:59.002 --> 00:53:04.347]  It's like a burning and an aching right through the hand, right through the arm.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.521]  Had it in my pocket, like I said, when I was in San Diego.
[00:53:08.541 --> 00:53:09.382]  It was real bad in San Diego.
[00:53:09.402 --> 00:53:11.103]  I was like, man, that's hurting.
[00:53:11.183 --> 00:53:15.265]  It's like, it pulse hot and I'd pull it out and it'd be pulse hot.
[00:53:17.186 --> 00:53:18.027]  It's from China.
[00:53:18.167 --> 00:53:20.908]  China controls the code keys for the whole cloud.
[00:53:21.088 --> 00:53:21.809]  It's all admitted.
[00:53:21.829 --> 00:53:28.292]  And I'm here criticizing the QICOMs and I've got a QICOM device inches from my testicles.
[00:53:30.202 --> 00:53:35.205]  I'm going to get more into the big picture and how to counter it and all the rest of it, but these are just personal experiences.
[00:53:35.225 --> 00:53:36.185]  Now, let's just show you mainstream news.
[00:53:36.205 --> 00:53:36.686]  You've been admitting it.
[00:53:36.846 --> 00:53:39.707]  Because they've got to tell you, like, on the cigarette pack, hey, this will give you cancer.
[00:53:40.248 --> 00:53:41.208]  That's their metaphysical rule.
[00:53:41.228 --> 00:53:49.793]  So, once everybody's addicted, everybody's habituated, now they tell you, oh, 5G smartphones cause cancer.
[00:53:50.173 --> 00:53:51.654]  Big Wireless doesn't want you to know.
[00:53:51.834 --> 00:53:53.195]  Wired Magazine last year.
[00:53:54.534 --> 00:53:55.415]  Breaking Journalist.
[00:53:55.935 --> 00:53:56.636]  That's another story.
[00:53:56.676 --> 00:53:57.977]  Laura Loomer's case goes forward on suit.
[00:53:57.997 --> 00:53:58.578]  That's good news.
[00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:00.379]  That got mixed in here.
[00:54:00.399 --> 00:54:04.863]  And then I've got all these other articles dealing with this.
[00:54:04.883 --> 00:54:07.906]  The Inconvenient Truth About Cancer and Mobile Phones.
[00:54:08.647 --> 00:54:09.207]  The Guardian.
[00:54:09.247 --> 00:54:09.988]  So they're telling you.
[00:54:10.428 --> 00:54:11.850]  Big report about how it's all embedded.
[00:54:12.796 --> 00:54:18.559]  California bans 5G cell tower over claims it causes cancer at a school where 20% of the kids got cancer.
[00:54:18.659 --> 00:54:22.662]  I mean, you didn't used to get one kid with cancer out of a million in the 1950s, folks.
[00:54:23.082 --> 00:54:26.524]  Now you can't swing a stick and not, you know, hit a kid that's got it.
[00:54:26.544 --> 00:54:27.844]  5G smartphones cause cancer.
[00:54:28.845 --> 00:54:29.265]  Another headline.
[00:54:29.285 --> 00:54:30.846]  These are all just boom, boom, boom.
[00:54:32.747 --> 00:54:35.429]  Now, here's where you'll stop them.
[00:54:36.357 --> 00:54:44.203]  Because once somebody's habituated to something, whether it's cigarettes, or whether it's liquor, or whether it's being abused by their significant other, they tend to put up with it.
[00:54:44.243 --> 00:54:46.165]  We adapt to being in our environment.
[00:54:47.766 --> 00:54:51.389]  We don't overcome it, we submit to it if we're not conscious.
[00:54:53.251 --> 00:54:55.152]  If we're conscious, then we can overcome.
[00:54:57.574 --> 00:55:03.279]  But remember this article in the New York Times in June, the land where the internet ends, Green Bank, West Virginia.
[00:55:08.558 --> 00:55:11.180]  Now, we'll put Google Maps up on screen here for folks.
[00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:16.224]  Dealing with this town.
[00:55:17.686 --> 00:55:25.492]  So, they have these zones all over the world now.
[00:55:25.672 --> 00:55:33.398]  We're discovering, and this is one of the cutting edge things that I've been working on, where they're building
[00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:39.791]  Communities that don't allow radio transmitters, cell phones, anything.
[00:55:39.831 --> 00:55:44.552]  And they always, the excuse is, oh, we're studying birds and bees here to see if electromagnetic's hurting them.
[00:55:44.772 --> 00:55:45.472]  They know it's killing them.
[00:55:45.912 --> 00:55:54.093]  Or, oh, we've got a SETI government NASA program here, and so it jams it if there's any electromagnetic radiation.
[00:55:54.413 --> 00:56:03.855]  And if you look at it, the land values and everything are skyrocketing in those areas, and they're getting some of the highest per capita people moving in, and there's shell corporations buying it up, and there's heavy
[00:56:04.295 --> 00:56:19.103]  Earth equipment and things going in and they're building underground bunkers in West Virginia in the tens of thousands of square mile area where the government has laws that you can have no transmission systems of any type.
[00:56:20.203 --> 00:56:29.128]  And it turns out China and the UK and the EU, all of these places aren't just building armored fortresses in the middle of nowhere.
[00:56:30.885 --> 00:56:42.314]  They are creating redoubts that don't have any radiation by law, and now they're even having police pull people over if they see them in the areas with cell phones.
[00:56:43.054 --> 00:56:47.678]  Even though the cell phones don't work, the police are making sure people don't have them.
[00:56:49.859 --> 00:56:53.622]  So, the establishment is building something.
[00:56:53.642 --> 00:56:55.344]  Now you're going to say, well wait a minute, are they going to live there all the time?
[00:56:55.384 --> 00:56:55.484]  No.
[00:56:56.468 --> 00:57:01.050]  You can oscillate 5G up and down, and I've got reports that it can give you cancer within three days.
[00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:07.313]  And so you talk about bird box and things like that, they don't have to give you cancer.
[00:57:07.553 --> 00:57:10.994]  They can also fluctuate, make people very, very irritable, very, very aggressive.
[00:57:11.454 --> 00:57:16.336]  And it won't be as bad where everybody starts bashing their brains out or crashing cars all together.
[00:57:18.097 --> 00:57:19.858]  It'll just be suicide goes off the charts.
[00:57:20.842 --> 00:57:21.782]  Abuse goes off the charts.
[00:57:22.243 --> 00:57:23.283]  Violence goes off the charts.
[00:57:23.423 --> 00:57:24.384]  Mass shootings off the charts.
[00:57:24.724 --> 00:57:26.044]  Which is starting to happen.
[00:57:26.325 --> 00:57:29.686]  And it's directly correlated with how the cell phones are reprogramming people.
[00:57:29.886 --> 00:57:33.548]  But also, the electromagnetic radiation is irritating the brain.
[00:57:33.748 --> 00:57:35.349]  But they can put carrier waves in.
[00:57:35.729 --> 00:57:37.710]  On record, this is not science fiction.
[00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:39.431]  We're in 2020 now, folks.
[00:57:39.511 --> 00:57:39.771]  Almost.
[00:57:40.251 --> 00:57:40.711]  This is it.
[00:57:40.751 --> 00:57:41.311]  This is the plan.
[00:57:41.592 --> 00:57:43.913]  So the establishment is going to go to these redoubts.
[00:57:44.813 --> 00:57:51.389]  When they decide to test riots or flip the total switch just like the Kingsmen, they're telling you the plan.
[00:57:52.693 --> 00:57:53.013]  Without...
[00:57:58.158 --> 00:58:12.288]  Every day I walk into the studio and I see all of the people working so hard against the tyranny of the left, against the tyranny of the globalists, and it just makes me think that all of these people are on the same page and they understand.
[00:58:12.929 --> 00:58:16.652]  They are awake to what is actually happening here.
[00:58:17.512 --> 00:58:21.933]  And Alex Jones has created something that is completely remarkable.
[00:58:22.273 --> 00:58:26.374]  People understand that Alex Jones is doing everything he can.
[00:58:26.454 --> 00:58:31.556]  He's putting everything on the line to wake up people and to fight for humanity.
[00:58:31.756 --> 00:58:43.919]  And for me, that is a great honor to be sitting here to try to represent the best of my ability and show my appreciation and say that, you know, InfoWars is a wonderful opportunity for anybody.
[00:58:44.059 --> 00:58:48.600]  Without you supporting InfoWars against what the left is doing, it doesn't happen.
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:52.481]  We don't have someone in the pocket like George Soros or Tom Steyer.
[00:58:52.621 --> 00:58:56.082]  All of these filthy rich billionaires just trying to take out America.
[00:58:56.322 --> 00:58:58.582]  Alex is depending on the American people.
[00:58:58.643 --> 00:59:03.004]  He's depending on all of us to step up and to support InfoWars.com.
[00:59:03.064 --> 00:59:07.165]  And when you share the articles, you tell them that you're not taking it lying down.
[00:59:07.185 --> 00:59:08.465]  You're not going to take it any longer.
[00:59:09.185 --> 00:59:18.231]  By you going to InfowarsStore.com, you show everybody that you love everything that Alex Jones is doing, and you don't believe the lies that's coming out of the left.
[00:59:18.351 --> 00:59:22.133]  That's what it comes down to, is if you believe the lies, then don't buy anything.
[00:59:22.634 --> 00:59:33.221]  But if you believe in humanity, you believe in this country, and you believe everything that Alex Jones has been doing here, then you need to go to InfowarsStore.com and buy the product.
[00:59:33.261 --> 00:59:38.204]  The Turbo Force, the Brain Force, the DNA Force, they're always doing specials that's
[00:59:38.524 --> 00:59:39.224]  Unbelievable!
[00:59:39.524 --> 00:59:43.845]  Have you ever seen anyone that's doing a special on their products constantly?
[00:59:43.945 --> 00:59:50.107]  And the main reason why they're doing it is because it gives people the opportunity to find out how good the products really are.
[00:59:50.147 --> 00:59:51.047]  That's what it comes down to.
[00:59:56.528 --> 01:00:00.429]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:04.036 --> 01:00:06.237]  Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:15.183]  I'm reporting to you from Hong Kong where I'm joined by reporter Greg Rees for the next week where we're going to be giving you live on the ground coverage of all the protests that have been going on here.
[01:00:15.724 --> 01:00:24.049]  Now we're right next to Victoria Park where just this past weekend 1.7 million people peacefully protest an extradition bill proposed earlier this year.
[01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.131]  Now a lot of people are wondering how did this all begin?
[01:00:27.211 --> 01:00:28.152]  Where did this all start?
[01:00:28.512 --> 01:00:33.956]  So I want to go ahead and take us back to the 1800s when Hong Kong was a colony a part of the United Kingdom.
[01:00:35.437 --> 01:00:42.300]  It wasn't until 1997 that Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty under the One Country, Two Systems policy.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:52.244]  Now, this policy made Hong Kong a special administrative region, and Hong Kong was semi-autonomous for 50 years, meaning they were allowed to keep many of the rights that we have today.
[01:00:52.604 --> 01:00:58.327]  Think freedom of press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, a lot of those rights that aren't common in mainland China.
[01:00:59.591 --> 01:01:01.612]  However, this is set to expire in 2047.
[01:01:02.772 --> 01:01:04.392]  Now let's take it back to 2018.
[01:01:04.593 --> 01:01:08.254]  Back in 2018, a couple from Hong Kong went on vacation to Taiwan.
[01:01:08.674 --> 01:01:13.355]  And on vacation, the boyfriend murdered his girlfriend and came back to the city of Hong Kong.
[01:01:13.995 --> 01:01:21.158]  Since he didn't commit the crime in the city, Hong Kong was unable to prosecute him for the crimes, which led them to propose the extradition bill earlier in 2019.
[01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:31.837]  Now this extradition bill would state that local authorities could take citizens from here in Hong Kong and extradite them to Taiwan and mainland China.
[01:01:32.774 --> 01:01:40.902]  Now, this made a lot of the citizens here very fearful because they felt that this undermined the autonomy of Hong Kong, that it infringed upon their rights.
[01:01:41.322 --> 01:01:47.788]  And again, as I said, that autonomy that was set for 50 years, starting 1997, set to expire 2047.
[01:01:48.068 --> 01:01:52.312]  Well, they felt that this is China beginning to expedite that process in 2019.
[01:01:54.514 --> 01:01:59.817]  As we talked about, there's not really freedom of speech, freedom of press, or freedom of assembly in mainland China.
[01:02:00.237 --> 01:02:03.939]  So, Hong Kongers really, really do not want that imposed upon them.
[01:02:04.819 --> 01:02:09.762]  We're going on 11 weeks of protests now, and these protests have been pro-democracy, pro-freedom.
[01:02:10.242 --> 01:02:15.205]  They've called for the Second Amendment, and they really want a lot of those rights that we have in America today.
[01:02:15.925 --> 01:02:22.310]  They've been using the American flag and singing the national anthems as signs of freedom and signs of democracy.
[01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:30.716]  However, these protests, they started off very, very peacefully, but we've seen a big uptick in violence, and people are questioning why that is.
[01:02:30.736 --> 01:02:44.285]  A lot of sources have come forward and said that counter-protesters, police, maybe even people from the Chinese government are dressing up as protesters, infiltrating the group to make them seem violent and hostile.
[01:02:45.246 --> 01:02:49.070]  Now, since these protests have started, we've seen airports shut down.
[01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:51.192]  There was an airport that was shut down for two days.
[01:02:51.493 --> 01:02:53.835]  We've seen reports of shootings, stabbings.
[01:02:53.915 --> 01:02:55.477]  People have been pepper sprayed.
[01:02:55.797 --> 01:02:56.858]  Batons have been used.
[01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.680]  So there's been a huge uptick in violence.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.362]  Somebody even got their eye shot out.
[01:03:01.002 --> 01:03:06.784]  So, Greg Reese is actually going to be coming out with a more in-depth report on who's infiltrating these groups and why that is.
[01:03:07.245 --> 01:03:18.209]  Not only that, but Facebook and Twitter just came out talking about how they had to shut down several social media accounts in mainland China that were trying to pose these protesters as hostile and violent.
[01:03:18.249 --> 01:03:20.070]  They're really trying to get them shut down over here.
[01:03:20.410 --> 01:03:30.317]  And as I said in the beginning of this report, at Victoria Park, 1.7 million people peacefully marched just this past weekend and another protest is set up for this past Sunday.
[01:03:30.717 --> 01:03:36.922]  Since we got here, locals have talked about how they just want a peaceful protest and they just want the government to hear their wants.
[01:03:37.242 --> 01:03:38.243]  They want peace here.
[01:03:38.863 --> 01:03:44.487]  So we're going to be talking to locals on the ground and we're going to be giving you that coverage continuously for the next week.
[01:03:44.827 --> 01:03:47.888]  So go to InfoWars.com where you can find those exclusive reports.
[01:03:48.249 --> 01:03:51.750]  Follow me on Twitter at Sab underscore says underscore.

[01:04:06.437 --> 01:04:12.622]  I was also reading an article earlier today about how fluoride in the water is making people's IQs drop.
[01:04:12.922 --> 01:04:16.304]  So go to our store and go invest in one of our water filters.
[01:04:16.885 --> 01:04:21.608]  Not only is that an investment in our journalism, but that's an investment into your health and your future.

[01:04:36.078 --> 01:04:38.639]  This has been Savannah Hernandez for InfoWars.com.
[01:04:38.859 --> 01:04:39.879]  Stay tuned for more reports.
[01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:42.400]  Alright, folks.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.882]  When we come back, I'm going to get back into the cell towers, the 5G, and the most important part about it.
[01:04:47.382 --> 01:04:49.103]  Because I always get the most important part at the end.
[01:04:49.983 --> 01:04:50.203]  Yeah.
[01:04:51.003 --> 01:04:51.964]  This is critical.
[01:04:52.004 --> 01:04:56.505]  They now admit that they're giving you cancer and that they're much stronger than they first told you.
[01:04:57.005 --> 01:04:58.006]  That's what I was getting to earlier.
[01:04:58.026 --> 01:04:59.906]  I don't need a study to tell me that.
[01:04:59.926 --> 01:05:01.347]  I can feel it burning my skin.
[01:05:07.099 --> 01:05:09.700]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[01:05:10.521 --> 01:05:13.703]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:05:14.563 --> 01:05:15.564]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:05:18.645 --> 01:05:20.426]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:05:23.288 --> 01:05:26.189]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:05:26.329 --> 01:05:27.470]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:32.053]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:05:32.153 --> 01:05:38.897]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:46.963]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[01:05:55.129 --> 01:05:56.350]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:05:59.036 --> 01:06:00.897]  You can't watch this, the movie.
[01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:14.368]  Available now at InfowarsStore.com Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:14.768 --> 01:06:16.129]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.133 --> 01:06:26.577]  So, last week, the Journal of American Medicine
[01:06:28.342 --> 01:06:30.284]  Came out and said, okay, it's inclusive.
[01:06:31.185 --> 01:06:33.127]  Fluoride massively lowers IQs.
[01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:34.888]  Twice as bad in men.
[01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.071]  And it's been taken out of the water.
[01:06:38.172 --> 01:06:39.072]  Well, they always knew that.
[01:06:39.213 --> 01:06:42.155]  And I showed you hundreds of studies going back over the years.
[01:06:42.196 --> 01:06:45.258]  I mean, one Harvard study had 25 studies within it in 2012.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.301]  So why are they telling you now?
[01:06:49.127 --> 01:06:53.489]  Well, smartphones may be leaking more radiation than we think.
[01:06:54.009 --> 01:07:09.497]  CNET News, the Associated Press, they're all telling you that it's putting off way more microwave radiation than the FDA and the FCC allow.
[01:07:11.318 --> 01:07:12.118]  Well, why is that?
[01:07:14.045 --> 01:07:16.446]  It's because they're being used for other purposes.
[01:07:17.166 --> 01:07:23.328]  And the microwave transmitters in these are way more powerful than what they're supposedly allowed to transmit at.
[01:07:25.349 --> 01:07:29.590]  Because all of these phones have other uses for corporations and governments.
[01:07:30.411 --> 01:07:32.691]  They can link them up and use them to surveil areas.
[01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:39.934]  They can blast out radiation with these and do a scan inside your house.
[01:07:39.954 --> 01:07:42.635]  Remember,
[01:07:44.244 --> 01:07:46.846]  Prometheus, the alien prequel?
[01:07:47.907 --> 01:07:56.454]  When they go into the ship and they put drones out, and then it shoots out a laser scan of the atmosphere and plays things that happened hundreds of years before on the ship?
[01:07:58.756 --> 01:08:01.719]  There's actually technology very close to that already that DARPA admits they have.
[01:08:01.919 --> 01:08:02.920]  Imagine what else they've got.
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:05.141]  So you see this stuff in movies, it's already here.
[01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:06.022]  Well, this is beyond that.
[01:08:06.563 --> 01:08:08.744]  Kinect, when it came out 10 years ago from Microsoft.
[01:08:09.225 --> 01:08:10.346]  We did reports on this first.
[01:08:12.501 --> 01:08:20.749]  It came out that they could scan not just through your walls but through four or five walls your whole house with a digital scan showing a guy on the toilet, somebody else in another room.
[01:08:22.170 --> 01:08:25.933]  You think it's scanning you with the Kinect system to see your movements playing games and sports.
[01:08:26.013 --> 01:08:37.604]  That's a radar system in your house blasting radiation at you and it's got a sensor that enough radiation bounces back
[01:08:39.363 --> 01:08:42.585]  And it's literally going like a TV scanner.
[01:08:42.966 --> 01:08:44.326]  That's how TV tubes used to project.
[01:08:44.707 --> 01:08:48.309]  Everybody knew back then, TVs were putting radiation off the old TVs.
[01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:50.811]  Well, nothing like this.
[01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:57.496]  So these suckers are blasting you with radiation and they admit it's doing it.
[01:08:57.676 --> 01:08:59.417]  Oh, by the way, it's much stronger than we thought.
[01:09:00.438 --> 01:09:01.939]  And how do so many public schools make money?
[01:09:06.022 --> 01:09:07.423]  They put cell towers
[01:09:08.564 --> 01:09:09.685]  Right above the schools.
[01:09:10.686 --> 01:09:18.431]  And then DARPA admits they can oscillate all of this to cause behavioral activity or illnesses.
[01:09:20.092 --> 01:09:26.597]  So they want all this because fiber optic doesn't put any radiation off other than light energy.
[01:09:27.877 --> 01:09:28.398]  Zero to humans.
[01:09:28.418 --> 01:09:29.779]  It's 500 to 1,000 times faster.
[01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:29.919]  And
[01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:40.396]  It's a good system.
[01:09:40.416 --> 01:09:41.477]  There's always a good technology.
[01:09:42.418 --> 01:09:50.422]  But if you can service millions of towers every hundred yards, 5G, that, oh, I get a faster download of the movie.
[01:09:50.462 --> 01:09:52.343]  Instead of taking a minute, it takes five seconds.
[01:09:52.704 --> 01:09:53.304]  Whoop-de-doo.
[01:09:53.344 --> 01:09:56.886]  That's so powerful, it's blasting right through you, rattling your DNA.
[01:09:57.146 --> 01:09:58.127]  That's what microwaves do.
[01:09:58.347 --> 01:09:59.367]  It's why it boils water.
[01:10:00.388 --> 01:10:02.369]  Well, we're 70% water.
[01:10:03.210 --> 01:10:08.853]  It rattles you like a hot dog or a casserole you put in the microwave.
[01:10:11.013 --> 01:10:20.639]  So, we reported it 10 years ago, three years before MIT admits that the Kinect system looks through your walls, like x-ray vision.
[01:10:21.099 --> 01:10:22.460]  Yeah, it looks through your DNA, too.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.200]  It fries it.
[01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:36.288]  And so the establishment is building redoubts in places like Green Bank, West Virginia, where no radio frequency or microwave frequency is allowed.
[01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:39.170]  And then we get into this whole area,
[01:10:40.683 --> 01:10:43.424]  It's not just physically rattling your DNA and breaking it.
[01:10:43.444 --> 01:10:44.885]  And when the DNA breaks, you get cancer.
[01:10:44.925 --> 01:10:45.505]  That's well known.
[01:10:46.026 --> 01:10:46.786]  That's on record.
[01:10:47.766 --> 01:10:53.369]  And the type of bizarre, very rare types of brain tumors are always on the side.
[01:10:53.409 --> 01:10:55.910]  They always ask, what side do you put your cell phone to?
[01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:56.611]  Left or right ear?
[01:10:57.551 --> 01:10:59.872]  Most people tend to use their arm to drive or whatever.
[01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:01.473]  Most people hold the phone with their left.
[01:11:01.493 --> 01:11:03.174]  You can look at the statistics.
[01:11:03.314 --> 01:11:07.656]  Most of these types of tumors are on the left frontal lobe.
[01:11:10.862 --> 01:11:16.389]  The skull is only as thick as a potato chip.
[01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.751]  Right there.
[01:11:17.771 --> 01:11:19.112]  That's why I can get killed getting hit in the temple.
[01:11:20.134 --> 01:11:28.384]  And you put that phone right up there with that transmitter, and it reportedly, within five minutes with an average cell phone, raises brain temperature one degree.
[01:11:29.105 --> 01:11:29.766]  Oh, we're cooking!
[01:11:32.349 --> 01:11:33.290]  So let's go further here.
[01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:34.991]  The government knows this.
[01:11:35.231 --> 01:11:37.553]  They know the fluoride's causing cancer, lowering IQs.
[01:11:37.813 --> 01:11:40.735]  They know the 5G and the regular cell stuff is frying us.
[01:11:41.236 --> 01:11:44.839]  They know the GMO that we eat leaks into our cells and causes cancer.
[01:11:45.199 --> 01:11:49.102]  They knew glyphosate grew tumors in the prostate and breast.
[01:11:49.823 --> 01:11:50.943]  It actually grows those types.
[01:11:52.244 --> 01:11:53.425]  That was known when they approved it.
[01:11:53.946 --> 01:11:55.167]  But they told you you could drink it.
[01:11:55.967 --> 01:11:57.709]  And it's in the water table all across the country.
[01:11:57.949 --> 01:12:00.291]  You wonder why you go to these small towns that grow corn and stuff.
[01:12:01.218 --> 01:12:03.698]  Everybody's dead from cancer, and they admit it's killing them!
[01:12:04.939 --> 01:12:08.439]  But they've always got something they use to kill us for 20, 30 years, and then, oh, that's bad!
[01:12:08.739 --> 01:12:09.940]  We got a new one even worse!
[01:12:16.221 --> 01:12:25.282]  This is a plan by evil people that have been given power, who lust after doing this, just like in rejecting poor whites and poor blacks with syphilis for 50 years.
[01:12:25.482 --> 01:12:25.942]  Tuskegee.
[01:12:26.162 --> 01:12:29.003]  And then it turns out, oh, our government did it in Guatemala, and they did it in
[01:12:30.421 --> 01:12:36.844]  Brazil, and they did it in Kenya, and they did it in Pakistan.
[01:12:37.564 --> 01:12:42.647]  They did it anywhere you had poor people that couldn't defend themselves or figure out what happened to them.
[01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:48.750]  Think about that.
[01:12:49.850 --> 01:12:51.731]  Because it's not just depopulation.
[01:12:53.252 --> 01:12:57.314]  The globalists are dumbing us down and poisoning us ahead of a big event.
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.321]  And they're not going to wait.
[01:13:00.341 --> 01:13:02.182]  They're not just going to slowly fry us with all this.
[01:13:03.183 --> 01:13:04.424]  They're going to test it.
[01:13:05.484 --> 01:13:11.768]  And they're going to need to move into areas, when they test it, that aren't being hit.
[01:13:12.208 --> 01:13:20.934]  In between mountain ranges in West Virginia, areas of Colorado, Utah, redoubts in a safe zone, certain areas is Kauai, we know that.
[01:13:22.162 --> 01:13:30.366]  And more and more, they're administrating and moving their children and everybody to armored fortresses, and then it's being reported by folks that I've talked to that are involved in security.
[01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:37.529]  Sometimes they'll just say, hey, let's go down to the bunker area and let's live there a few days, just to see, because they're getting below ground.
[01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:45.212]  For whatever it is they know they're doing with the atmosphere or electromagnetic radiation, we don't have all the answers.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.881]  Maybe they know something about the sun we don't know.
[01:13:48.621 --> 01:13:49.962]  They're keeping all of this from us.
[01:13:50.322 --> 01:13:57.825]  And they don't want Trump in there with his executive power to be able to start looking into all the suppressed technologies, all the life extension.
[01:13:58.046 --> 01:13:59.446]  Because we're not being given life extension.
[01:13:59.766 --> 01:14:00.747]  Infant mortality is up.
[01:14:01.207 --> 01:14:03.068]  Lessoners live less long.
[01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:05.529]  So now our life expectancy is shorter.
[01:14:06.129 --> 01:14:07.830]  And we're being poisoned and we're being killed.
[01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:13.293]  And then we go to them and they've got all these expensive treatments that keep you alive a little longer.
[01:14:14.261 --> 01:14:15.401]  But still can't extend your life.
[01:14:16.002 --> 01:14:18.522]  So it's a perfect binary weapon.
[01:14:19.462 --> 01:14:32.686]  They poison you, and then you go in and they poison you again, but with a poison that partially blocks that poison, but both poisons kill you, but they get all your money, they control you, and then they test all of this on us while they're at it.
[01:14:33.006 --> 01:14:34.887]  That's what the medical system calls us, patients.
[01:14:37.708 --> 01:14:41.829]  Because we're being tested on, and that's why doctors call it their practice.
[01:14:43.268 --> 01:14:46.869]  Because it's an art form, and they're always practicing for the king.
[01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:56.232]  They're going to test brain surgeries, and they're going to test everything on you, and then once they perfect it, it's given to the overlords.
[01:14:57.373 --> 01:14:59.053]  So all of this is hidden in plain view.
[01:14:59.674 --> 01:15:01.474]  Now, the Hippocratic Oath is supposed to block all that.
[01:15:01.514 --> 01:15:03.135]  They don't have the Hippocrates Oath anymore.
[01:15:03.335 --> 01:15:03.795]  Do no harm.
[01:15:05.596 --> 01:15:12.658]  And so, all the big money and even mid-level folks that found out about this, they're all pulling up stakes and moving in between mountain ranges.
[01:15:14.062 --> 01:15:15.863]  And then they're passing laws to keep the stuff out.
[01:15:18.103 --> 01:15:19.424]  But they don't warn anybody.
[01:15:20.104 --> 01:15:25.066]  And I've talked to some of these people, I know some of these people, who aren't in the globalist system but know about it.
[01:15:25.866 --> 01:15:31.968]  And the globalists have admitted this, they'll recruit you, they'll say, hey, some really serious stuff's coming, you want to join us, you can't stop it.
[01:15:32.508 --> 01:15:35.409]  And people see Trump trying to stop it, me trying to stop it, they go, oh, you'll never stop it.
[01:15:35.589 --> 01:15:36.650]  But see, Trump has whine spots.
[01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:40.151]  He knows Barron got hurt by a vaccine, so he says, oh, we should look at it.
[01:15:40.491 --> 01:15:41.832]  But then they say, oh, 5G, sir.
[01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:43.592]  Ours will be bigger than the CHICOMs.
[01:15:43.612 --> 01:15:46.453]  It'll be the next level, the next boom, and we'll get 10 million jobs.
[01:15:46.473 --> 01:15:47.494]  He thinks, great, that's good.
[01:15:48.034 --> 01:15:49.854]  Oh, sir, don't listen to the quacks about 5G.
[01:15:49.894 --> 01:15:50.575]  It's perfectly fine.
[01:15:51.655 --> 01:15:53.676]  Mr. President, that's exactly how they're going to kill you.
[01:15:54.196 --> 01:15:57.117]  And I just read last week they put in 5G at the White House.
[01:15:57.737 --> 01:15:59.578]  I think, Mr. President, you need to pull the 5G out.
[01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:04.252]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:16:04.532 --> 01:16:06.294]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[01:16:06.654 --> 01:16:08.016]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:16:08.396 --> 01:16:09.317]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:16:10.158 --> 01:16:14.563]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:16:15.484 --> 01:16:17.166]  So, you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:16:17.366 --> 01:16:17.947]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:16:18.668 --> 01:16:19.408]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:16:20.413 --> 01:16:21.674]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:16:21.894 --> 01:16:24.315]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[01:16:24.595 --> 01:16:25.355]  I don't want them to win.
[01:16:25.735 --> 01:16:27.756]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[01:16:28.656 --> 01:16:31.438]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:16:31.778 --> 01:16:34.539]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[01:16:34.939 --> 01:16:38.681]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:16:38.721 --> 01:16:39.961]  These will change your life.
[01:16:40.301 --> 01:16:41.682]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[01:16:41.702 --> 01:16:43.402]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:16:43.703 --> 01:16:44.383]  Check it all out.
[01:16:44.403 --> 01:16:46.004]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:16:46.344 --> 01:16:47.964]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[01:16:48.144 --> 01:16:49.325]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:50.767]  You get great products at the same time.

[01:18:03.368 --> 01:18:09.429]  The Democrats are making it no secret that they're trying to take away our freedom and they're trying to take away our flag.

[01:19:03.954 --> 01:19:07.500]  Well today, InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[01:19:08.342 --> 01:19:13.170]  I just devoured your cousin InfoWars Live Protein Bar.
[01:19:34.127 --> 01:19:38.768]  What in the world's going on here?
[01:20:06.843 --> 01:20:09.564]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:16.167 --> 01:20:20.349]  Spend my days with a woman unkind.
[01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:25.791]  Smoke my stuff and drink all my wine.
[01:20:39.786 --> 01:21:02.801]  Okay, I just spent the last hour and 15 minutes or so, before we went to break, last hour and 16 minutes, getting into cell phones and electromagnetic radiation.
[01:21:03.581 --> 01:21:05.963]  Everybody knows that the sun is radiating
[01:21:06.863 --> 01:21:08.785]  Light radiation, a bunch of other forms of radiation.
[01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:11.547]  You know, if you go out in it all day, it can kill you.
[01:21:13.248 --> 01:21:14.049]  Especially if you're white.
[01:21:17.352 --> 01:21:23.877]  But... There's all these other invisible forms to our eyes.
[01:21:25.699 --> 01:21:28.521]  You know, it's like a dog can't see most colors.
[01:21:28.581 --> 01:21:29.262]  They're colorblind.
[01:21:29.282 --> 01:21:30.623]  They can see some red, some blue.
[01:21:32.244 --> 01:21:33.986]  Lions see black and white.
[01:21:35.526 --> 01:21:36.927]  Tigers see black and white.
[01:21:37.087 --> 01:21:39.748]  Cows can only see black and white, but they can see the color red.
[01:21:41.569 --> 01:21:43.069]  Now, does the color green exist?
[01:21:46.491 --> 01:21:50.353]  Because... Take a deer.
[01:21:50.653 --> 01:21:51.573]  Deer see black and white.
[01:21:53.134 --> 01:21:55.275]  That's why they see movement and things, but they don't really see color.
[01:21:56.956 --> 01:21:58.216]  Now, does color exist?
[01:21:59.097 --> 01:22:00.017]  Because they can't see it?
[01:22:02.178 --> 01:22:03.139]  I mean, I can feel...
[01:22:04.181 --> 01:22:11.445]  This little robot spy computer system, when it's malfunctioning or whatever it does, blasting me with radiation now.
[01:22:11.626 --> 01:22:12.766]  This just started a few weeks ago.
[01:22:13.106 --> 01:22:14.487]  I was talking to the boom operator.
[01:22:14.507 --> 01:22:16.909]  He says, yeah, his phone does it too sometimes.
[01:22:16.929 --> 01:22:17.809]  You'll feel it burning him.
[01:22:17.829 --> 01:22:19.290]  And it's not just a heat.
[01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:20.071]  Something's happening.
[01:22:20.291 --> 01:22:27.815]  And then it's in the news that they're blasting out way more radiation than what the FDA says is tolerable, allowable.
[01:22:27.835 --> 01:22:28.656]  They're not saying it's safe.
[01:22:28.956 --> 01:22:33.619]  They say the allowable level gives rats cancer.
[01:22:34.761 --> 01:22:50.324]  And then people give their little kids these, because you get to go, you know, sit there at the restaurant, hand it to your two-year-old, and they sit there drooling over it for an hour, with that zombie look in their eyes, while you're killing them.
[01:22:51.064 --> 01:22:52.744]  And look, I think we've all done it.
[01:22:55.725 --> 01:22:59.326]  But my first two children, we never let them have anything close to computers or anything.
[01:22:59.706 --> 01:23:01.486]  Like Steve Jobs wouldn't let his children have computers.
[01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:04.244]  Wouldn't let him have smartphones and all that.
[01:23:04.685 --> 01:23:06.865]  He said it would brain damage him, which he knew what it was designed to do.
[01:23:07.525 --> 01:23:09.786]  Bill Gates wouldn't let his kids have phones until they were 14.
[01:23:11.126 --> 01:23:12.267]  And they told him to limit their use.
[01:23:14.287 --> 01:23:15.768]  You'll always hear, like, what does Tim Cook say?
[01:23:15.788 --> 01:23:16.948]  Well, I want to be on my phone less.
[01:23:18.569 --> 01:23:19.469]  They know what they are.
[01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:21.890]  But they've got to walk around with them in front of us.
[01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:22.790]  But let me tell you what they really do.
[01:23:23.130 --> 01:23:25.611]  When they're not using them, we sell these, but it's not a pitch.
[01:23:26.171 --> 01:23:29.212]  We have the blocket pockets and the little Faraday cages, little purses.
[01:23:30.072 --> 01:23:31.973]  When you're not using the eye of Shorin,
[01:23:33.038 --> 01:23:37.939]  You better have it in a bag, because then it can't track you, and then it's blocking most of the radiation.
[01:23:38.739 --> 01:23:44.140]  Because remember, you got the towers that are really frying you, and then you got the little transmitters themselves.
[01:23:45.961 --> 01:23:54.543]  And I told you all of this, because when they use these things, they can scan your whole house with them.
[01:23:55.603 --> 01:23:56.623]  They're radar guns.
[01:23:57.703 --> 01:24:00.824]  And I just showed you MIT reports on that seven, eight years ago.
[01:24:02.403 --> 01:24:04.604]  So again, we're not making any of this up.
[01:24:04.664 --> 01:24:05.464]  You have been warned.
[01:24:06.724 --> 01:24:07.804]  It's a critical thing.
[01:24:07.844 --> 01:24:08.985]  I'm not going to talk about it anymore.
[01:24:10.725 --> 01:24:12.465]  But as a society, we have to say no.
[01:24:13.305 --> 01:24:15.026]  We have to realize that it's evil.
[01:24:15.906 --> 01:24:17.706]  And it's because the globalists want omnipresence.
[01:24:18.547 --> 01:24:23.788]  You can go plug in with the very same computers into ports with fiber optics and have no side effects.
[01:24:24.653 --> 01:24:29.014]  They could still spy on you, they could still track you, but only when you're plugging in.
[01:24:29.595 --> 01:24:31.655]  Could it then get a, you know, the research of what the phone got.
[01:24:32.075 --> 01:24:33.716]  But they want it in live time.
[01:24:34.856 --> 01:24:36.417]  And the first place to get it is D.C.
[01:24:36.437 --> 01:24:37.637]  They're putting it in all over D.C.
[01:24:37.757 --> 01:24:38.098]  right now.
[01:24:41.619 --> 01:24:46.880]  And we're just accepting this, and it's all been tested 50 years ago.
[01:24:47.841 --> 01:24:48.801]  The white papers were out.
[01:24:49.561 --> 01:24:50.022]  And they did it!
[01:24:50.702 --> 01:24:51.242]  They rolled it out.
[01:24:53.663 --> 01:24:55.364]  You know, where are the lawsuits over all this?
[01:24:55.564 --> 01:24:56.484]  Oh, see, don't do that.
[01:24:56.504 --> 01:24:57.745]  Where are the lawsuits over fluoride?
[01:24:58.045 --> 01:24:58.725]  Oh, don't do that.
[01:24:58.805 --> 01:24:59.166]  That's all.
[01:24:59.266 --> 01:25:04.308]  The lawyers are controlled because they know the judges are controlled at many levels.
[01:25:04.908 --> 01:25:07.350]  And so the judges, I guess they're going to kill themselves and their children.
[01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:13.592]  I mean, we're all signed on to this globalist suicide pack, and there's no reason we need to be.
[01:25:14.053 --> 01:25:15.113]  There's no reason to be part of this.
[01:25:19.535 --> 01:25:22.357]  We have a special guest joining us in the third hour.
[01:25:23.823 --> 01:25:26.284]  I also really enjoyed taking phone calls.
[01:25:28.544 --> 01:25:30.544]  Paul Joseph Watson is in Hong Kong.
[01:25:31.085 --> 01:25:34.645]  He'll be on with us during the protest Sunday and right through next week.
[01:25:34.845 --> 01:25:40.006]  We've had Greg Reese and Savannah Hernandez really file some first class reports from there.
[01:25:41.647 --> 01:25:44.627]  Those are up on Infowars.com and really, really need to be seen.
[01:25:44.647 --> 01:25:47.608]  They're amazing reports.
[01:25:48.757 --> 01:25:49.758]  I've already aired three of them.
[01:25:49.938 --> 01:25:53.822]  There are a whole bunch more that we're just not, with the time we have, going to be able to air.
[01:25:54.882 --> 01:25:59.246]  But one of the most powerful is China's plan for Hong Kong invasion revealed.
[01:26:00.968 --> 01:26:03.490]  And he goes right to the invasion point where the troops are massing.
[01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:06.813]  And this is a big, big deal.
[01:26:07.513 --> 01:26:15.400]  So, that's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com right now.
[01:26:16.676 --> 01:26:22.659]  And just, I know I harp on this because without you telling people about whatever you think the most important thing is, we're covering.
[01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:27.342]  Because what's important to you might not be as important to me, but we cover everything, basically.
[01:26:27.982 --> 01:26:30.263]  And then you can send that on to warn people and show them.
[01:26:31.724 --> 01:26:33.265]  Hey, don't give your kids cell phones.
[01:26:34.045 --> 01:26:38.988]  Hey, if you live out in a rural area where they've been planting corn and stuff with Roundup, you better filter your water.
[01:26:39.048 --> 01:26:43.811]  Hey, if you got a baby, don't give it that fluoridated water that they pitched you at the store.
[01:26:45.031 --> 01:26:45.792]  Bayer knew
[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:52.062]  But millions of hemophiliacs were given HIV and hepatitis, and they said, it's good, let's get rid of them.
[01:26:53.543 --> 01:26:59.906]  That came out 15 years ago, in the corporate minutes of the French and Australian arm of Bayer.
[01:27:01.447 --> 01:27:02.708]  And who supplied them the blood?
[01:27:04.129 --> 01:27:04.589]  The Clintons.
[01:27:06.250 --> 01:27:11.832]  They had the waivers where the blood was not tested, and then it was passed on to others, knowingly.
[01:27:11.953 --> 01:27:16.535]  And the executives said, there's too many of these hemophiliacs, let's do the world a favor.
[01:27:17.884 --> 01:27:24.169]  And they knowingly did that, knowing they'd be protected, knowing that they'd then suck all the money out of them for the HIV and the hepatitis.
[01:27:25.290 --> 01:27:27.292]  That's just one little window into these executives.
[01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:29.974]  And you're like, where do they get these people?
[01:27:30.014 --> 01:27:36.980]  They go out and find psychotics, high-functioning psychotics with high IQs, and they recruit them.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:41.704]  And after they've committed all these crimes, they go, now you're the head of Monsanto, now you're the head of Bayer.
[01:27:42.662 --> 01:27:43.782]  One of the top Nazi companies.
[01:27:44.243 --> 01:27:46.644]  Now you are the head of the UN.
[01:27:46.724 --> 01:27:47.324]  Now you're the head.
[01:27:47.384 --> 01:27:48.765]  And that's who these people are.
[01:27:50.345 --> 01:27:51.626]  And they go have eugenics meetings.
[01:27:52.246 --> 01:27:54.307]  They talk about how the elite are the masters.
[01:27:55.227 --> 01:27:58.309]  And how the general public are garbage and have to be exterminated.
[01:27:58.629 --> 01:28:00.990]  But if we kill them right out in the open, they'll fight back.
[01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:06.912]  But if we slowly poison them and dumb them down, the bastards will never know what hit them.
[01:28:08.313 --> 01:28:09.473]  And that's the society.
[01:28:09.793 --> 01:28:11.014]  So you hear about Epstein.
[01:28:13.047 --> 01:28:20.352]  Running the, you know, the Albert Einstein Institute and running the secret society with the Rockefellers and Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates at those meetings.
[01:28:20.372 --> 01:28:21.213]  That's mainstream news.
[01:28:22.994 --> 01:28:32.600]  And, them talking about the master race and cloning and inseminating hundreds of women with his master seed.
[01:28:34.822 --> 01:28:35.602]  You go, what is that?
[01:28:36.503 --> 01:28:39.525]  Well, go read the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute funded by the Rockefellers.
[01:28:39.845 --> 01:28:40.806]  It's the exact stuff!
[01:28:42.264 --> 01:28:44.566]  Remember the Nazi officers had to have 20 kids apiece?
[01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:48.228]  It's a plan!
[01:28:48.708 --> 01:28:49.309]  It's public!
[01:28:49.809 --> 01:28:50.870]  We can stop them together!
[01:28:51.170 --> 01:28:53.111]  But we gotta admit how horrible it is.
[01:28:53.592 --> 01:28:55.193]  That's the leg it's got up on.
[01:28:55.233 --> 01:28:56.153]  It's so horrible.
[01:28:56.173 --> 01:28:59.035]  It's like when they find dead bodies in the neighbor's yard.
[01:28:59.075 --> 01:28:59.776]  You can't believe it.
[01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:14.638]  We were winning, Antifa was over, the culture wars had been won, it was time to gloat, we were winning the meme war, everyone was laughing, and then...
[01:29:15.973 --> 01:29:20.135]  You get depersoned to the point where you don't exist.
[01:29:20.395 --> 01:29:21.955]  Like, Laura Loomer had to leave New York.
[01:29:22.716 --> 01:29:27.938]  She's living in a place, I don't think I can even say, across from a police station so they can get there fast.
[01:29:28.538 --> 01:29:31.279]  Steven Crowder's had to move many times.
[01:29:31.739 --> 01:29:33.240]  Dana Lash's had to move.
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:36.281]  And when these people move, they don't make it a slow decision.
[01:29:36.321 --> 01:29:38.002]  They have to pack up in the middle of the night.
[01:29:38.522 --> 01:29:39.442]  I'm gonna have to move.
[01:29:42.689 --> 01:29:47.313]  Tommy Robertson has to move, and he has done so several times.
[01:29:49.775 --> 01:30:06.030]  So, I think you have these negligent, family-less media sources trivializing these allegations because it makes for a salacious headline, but they don't realize that they endanger people's lives, and like, they put these people's children in danger.
[01:30:07.298 --> 01:30:22.615]  You know, Dana Lash's kids have a, have a, you know, most, most, actually I shouldn't just say Dana Lash, most of these conservatives have spoken to their principals about attack plans and what happens if there's a threat to the school, not to the school, but to the student or something like that.
[01:30:24.332 --> 01:30:32.234]  So, it's a strange dichotomy where you have this incredibly severe punishment for the right.
[01:30:33.174 --> 01:30:36.434]  But the people doling out the punishment are these flaky babysitters.
[01:30:37.115 --> 01:30:39.955]  Like the SPLC can shut down my life.
[01:30:40.515 --> 01:30:44.196]  And then you read their articles and it says, you want bigots, Gavin?
[01:30:44.236 --> 01:30:45.236]  This is how you get bigots.
[01:30:45.616 --> 01:30:47.216]  Talking like a bratty babysitter.
[01:30:47.917 --> 01:30:49.497]  So, you have
[01:30:50.953 --> 01:30:55.795]  You have someone who wants to replace the judicial system, basically, with their own kangaroo court.
[01:30:56.475 --> 01:31:00.616]  SPLC's like that, AVL's like that, the media's like that, they're judge, jury, and executioner.
[01:31:00.656 --> 01:31:04.798]  And you think, okay, if you're going to take over hundreds of years of justice,
[01:31:05.936 --> 01:31:13.260]  You better be real thorough, because you're basically saying you're better than millions of people in hundreds of years, maybe thousands of years.
[01:31:14.161 --> 01:31:15.742]  And then they're so flippant about it.
[01:31:16.282 --> 01:31:18.123]  So they're doing this the same with conservatives.
[01:31:18.143 --> 01:31:24.427]  They're just sort of assuming someone said something, taking it out of context, and then just destroying it.
[01:31:24.487 --> 01:31:28.049]  But it's been an underhanded trick of warfare for a long time.
[01:31:28.069 --> 01:31:31.231]  I mean, the English did it to the Americans in the American Revolution.
[01:31:31.692 --> 01:31:33.993]  The English did it to the Boers in the Boer War.
[01:31:36.695 --> 01:31:38.877]  It's a common trick that the weak people do.
[01:31:38.937 --> 01:31:41.640]  It's a common trick people do who don't have families.
[01:31:41.660 --> 01:31:51.389]  And so they say, I'm gonna call this guy a Nazi without thinking that his son is gonna get, you know, accosted due to these rumors.
[01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:53.531]  I don't think they really believe it.
[01:31:54.592 --> 01:32:00.754]  When they talk about white supremacy, I don't believe them that they think it's a big threat.
[01:32:00.794 --> 01:32:03.515]  I think they're just, it's a game to them.
[01:32:04.355 --> 01:32:08.176]  And it's kind of the problem with the death of the family is everything becomes a silly game.
[01:32:09.257 --> 01:32:12.458]  Make no mistake, it's, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:32:13.318 --> 01:32:15.219]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:32:17.399 --> 01:32:19.140]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[01:32:22.028 --> 01:32:24.929]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[01:32:25.169 --> 01:32:26.289]  It's a form of fascism.
[01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:30.810]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[01:32:30.910 --> 01:32:37.631]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[01:32:42.232 --> 01:32:45.673]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[01:32:53.852 --> 01:32:55.093]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:32:57.795 --> 01:32:58.855]  You can't watch this.
[01:32:59.155 --> 01:32:59.616]  The movie.
[01:32:59.796 --> 01:33:02.558]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[01:33:06.260 --> 01:33:08.862]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.808 --> 01:33:22.351]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:22.671 --> 01:33:25.173]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.594 --> 01:33:29.656]  Well, I'm glad folks are watching Matt Drudge's Twitter.
[01:33:30.096 --> 01:33:32.698]  I'm not on Twitter, I'm banned on there, but Drudge isn't yet.
[01:33:32.758 --> 01:33:33.479]  Hopefully he won't be.
[01:33:33.499 --> 01:33:37.821]  Hopefully Trump takes action against this silencing of tens of millions of Americans.
[01:33:39.062 --> 01:33:45.807]  And I was going to segue out of the 5G, but then I was also thinking, I just spent an hour and a half now talking about it.
[01:33:46.997 --> 01:33:54.881]  And I didn't do a condensed boil-down just showing the admissions that it is giving you cancer, that the phones are already leaking more radiation than they're supposed to.
[01:33:55.242 --> 01:34:02.546]  At the admitted allowable levels, increases in cancer in rats, they now have human studies, the first of their kind coming out.
[01:34:03.286 --> 01:34:10.270]  And so what I'll do is, since Matt Drudge tweeted this out to millions of people, and I was already thinking about this because I'm so obsessed with it, it's everything.
[01:34:11.691 --> 01:34:13.912]  The government corporations know it's giving us cancer.
[01:34:16.457 --> 01:34:26.039]  That's an actual MRI scan, if you look on the television screen right there, of the radiation blasting into your brain just from a cell phone.
[01:34:26.519 --> 01:34:31.620]  And again, I showed you Wired Magazine with top scientists saying 5G is giving you cancer.
[01:34:34.881 --> 01:34:35.681]  And I was in D.C.
[01:34:35.721 --> 01:34:40.462]  a few months ago, and they already had 5G in some areas, and now reportedly they put it in around the White House.
[01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:44.512]  I mean, who cares if it's Huawei or AT&T, man?
[01:34:44.552 --> 01:34:47.855]  This stuff is deadly and it can scan everything you're doing.
[01:34:48.716 --> 01:34:49.977]  That's why it's an actual security threat.
[01:34:52.019 --> 01:34:58.424]  Well, it's a threat to everybody, so since Drudge did that, I'm gonna come back in the next segment.
[01:34:58.904 --> 01:35:00.666]  I was giving this like a minute before I went back on air.
[01:35:01.206 --> 01:35:09.834]  I'm going to get all my articles together, because I saw some more I didn't get to, and I'm like, oh, I should probably... I'll do a condensed segment next on that.
[01:35:11.949 --> 01:35:17.713]  And you try to pull it all in and not get into the bigger picture, but just the facts of the science.
[01:35:19.074 --> 01:35:29.982]  Now that said, speaking of science, there's a big national company based in Colorado, and they didn't mind saying who they were a couple years ago when my dad got this great deal.
[01:35:31.603 --> 01:35:32.824]  He's a chemist, not just a dentist.
[01:35:33.905 --> 01:35:37.748]  And he was looking around to get medical grade silver and actually got the biggest company.
[01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:39.854]  And it turns out there are big listeners.
[01:35:39.894 --> 01:35:42.196]  I said, no, let me private label it so you don't get any of the heat.
[01:35:42.957 --> 01:35:50.723]  People got the super silver wound gel that is the strongest over-the-counter nanotech special silver system.
[01:35:51.884 --> 01:35:54.246]  And it's FDA approved to be over-the-counter.
[01:35:55.027 --> 01:35:55.967]  So it's over-the-counter drug.
[01:35:56.588 --> 01:35:58.089]  It's $40 retail in stores.
[01:35:58.630 --> 01:35:59.410]  Hospitals have it.
[01:36:00.271 --> 01:36:00.891]  We sell it for $29.95.
[01:36:01.011 --> 01:36:05.935]  And a lot of money goes into the patenting
[01:36:07.134 --> 01:36:12.438]  And the lawyers and all that, and so even though they came out with this a few years ago, and let us private label it, they're still paying that off.
[01:36:12.759 --> 01:36:14.060]  So that's why it's $29.95.
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:14.880]  Still a great deal.
[01:36:15.401 --> 01:36:16.201]  Everybody needs it.
[01:36:16.702 --> 01:36:23.607]  Once you've been wounded, once you've got a scratch, or a little bit when you're going to be going out and doing something, don't ingest it, though, because it's really strong.
[01:36:24.408 --> 01:36:26.009]  It's not good for bacteria and viruses for a reason.
[01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:28.010]  It's mean.
[01:36:28.671 --> 01:36:30.412]  And the particles are so small, they go right into them.
[01:36:31.533 --> 01:36:32.574]  So this is the best stuff out there.
[01:36:33.335 --> 01:36:33.875]  It's 25% off right now.
[01:36:36.288 --> 01:36:37.449]  We've had this in for two weeks.
[01:36:37.509 --> 01:36:45.975]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting from the same company, but it's new.
[01:36:46.636 --> 01:36:49.978]  Working with another big skincare company, but then producing it in their factory.
[01:36:51.339 --> 01:36:53.721]  It's super silver skin cream.
[01:36:54.833 --> 01:37:02.560]  And so, it's got all of these benefits, too many to mention, but it's revolutionary, it's brand new, people are going to love it.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.585]  Introducing the new Super Silver Skin Cream, exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com, 25% off introductory price.
[01:37:08.925 --> 01:37:10.587]  InfoWars Live is very excited about this.
[01:37:10.947 --> 01:37:13.630]  The new Super Silver Skin Cream is the best of both worlds.
[01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:15.972]  It helps reduce wrinkles and keep your skin healthy.
[01:37:16.412 --> 01:37:19.215]  It kills dangerous viruses and bacteria that make you sick.
[01:37:19.775 --> 01:37:23.919]  Super Silver Skin Cream is infused with patented Silver Sol Technology.
[01:37:23.939 --> 01:37:30.025]  It's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida Fungus.
[01:37:30.586 --> 01:37:40.015]  It's also loaded with the best natural ingredients for your skin, like Coconut Oil, Vitamin E. Unlike most skin creams, Super Silver Skin Cream is free of BPA.
[01:37:41.276 --> 01:37:44.259]  And parabens, harsh preservatives, and sulfates.
[01:37:44.319 --> 01:37:59.251]  Independent studies have shown that silver salt technology in super silver skin cream is 20 ppm silver is usually 10 times more effective than amateur and similar products containing up to 3,000 ppm silver.
[01:37:59.911 --> 01:38:00.492]  And it goes on.
[01:38:00.932 --> 01:38:01.973]  This stuff is the real deal.
[01:38:01.993 --> 01:38:06.337]  Get super silver skin cream exclusively at Forrestore.com while supplies last.
[01:38:06.717 --> 01:38:10.340]  It's got the highly sought after hyaluronic acid.
[01:38:12.199 --> 01:38:21.624]  So this is stuff that has a lot of known great compounds, and it's got the silver in it from one of the top, probably the top group out there.
[01:38:22.404 --> 01:38:27.167]  So you definitely want to get this for yourself for external use only.
[01:38:27.967 --> 01:38:34.330]  We are very, very, very, very excited about this, and we've got it in the
[01:38:36.051 --> 01:38:36.872]  Straight, no scent.
[01:38:36.952 --> 01:38:37.732]  It's not really a scent.
[01:38:37.833 --> 01:38:38.333]  It's natural.
[01:38:38.713 --> 01:38:40.955]  And we've also got it with the grapefruit.
[01:38:41.355 --> 01:38:42.436]  It's also got all those added.
[01:38:42.977 --> 01:38:44.017]  We have little tubes of it.
[01:38:44.057 --> 01:38:44.978]  We have big tubes of it.
[01:38:45.579 --> 01:38:47.220]  And it's a great deal.
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:51.243]  Let's put that back on screen for TV viewers.
[01:38:51.303 --> 01:38:53.505]  Again, $7.45 for the little one.
[01:38:55.106 --> 01:39:01.431]  And if you get the big ones, you get an even better deal for the amount that you get, $14.95.
[01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:02.051]  And I can tell you,
[01:39:04.591 --> 01:39:06.935]  Similar brands sold in stores that don't have the silver.
[01:39:07.677 --> 01:39:08.919]  Retail for $25.
[01:39:08.979 --> 01:39:09.299]  Sell for $19.95.
[01:39:10.341 --> 01:39:11.844]  So this is even better at $14.95.
[01:39:12.846 --> 01:39:13.908]  That is a really good deal.
[01:39:14.428 --> 01:39:16.772]  Everybody should have super silver.
[01:39:18.223 --> 01:39:22.048]  Wound dressing gel in their cabinet, in their truck, when you go camping, whatever.
[01:39:22.668 --> 01:39:30.798]  I mean, I don't get into personal stuff, but when I go swimming a lot in creeks and things on Outdoors Guy, in the summer and things, and I have a cat, they carry fungus on them.
[01:39:30.838 --> 01:39:31.559]  They call it ringworm.
[01:39:31.579 --> 01:39:32.280]  It grows in a circle.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.042]  And ever since I was a kid, I'd get a few.
[01:39:34.442 --> 01:39:38.147]  And you go get the antifungal stuff, and it takes a week to knock it out.
[01:39:39.605 --> 01:39:41.986]  This isn't even supposedly for that, even though it's known to kill fungus.
[01:39:42.006 --> 01:39:43.587]  Man, one day, boom, gone.
[01:39:43.928 --> 01:39:49.931]  I mean, it takes time for the skin to grow backwards, but I mean, it, it, it, it, well, it also takes a week to get rid of the fungus that keeps growing.
[01:39:50.372 --> 01:39:56.095]  You ever like, you know, get in a hot tub or take a hot shower and you feel like, and then that's when it kind of rises up and you can see the fungus ring.
[01:39:56.715 --> 01:39:57.656]  You're like, oh, I got a ringworm.
[01:39:58.136 --> 01:40:04.720]  This stuff works a lot faster and that's why it's got 100% reviews because it is the very best.
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:09.103]  All right, I'm going to stop ranting here and stop plugging, but that is how we fund this operation.
[01:40:12.816 --> 01:40:17.600]  I don't have time to get to this Joe Rogan piece where he's, again, come out and said that I was right about things.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.302]  But it's up on Infowars.com.
[01:40:20.342 --> 01:40:22.083]  I may have time to air it a little bit later.
[01:40:23.064 --> 01:40:27.327]  But when we come back, I'm going to go through my stack here because it's all over the table right now.
[01:40:27.907 --> 01:40:30.228]  And just get you all the latest news, all the admissions.
[01:40:30.688 --> 01:40:34.389]  Then I'm going to tie it into the smart meters controlling your thermostat.
[01:40:34.489 --> 01:40:41.530]  The government's not just going to tell you keep it at 78 to 82 to save the earth and save the rainforest and all this made-up stuff.
[01:40:42.131 --> 01:40:43.751]  Save the rainforest, burn more carbon.
[01:40:44.091 --> 01:40:45.611]  That's what plants respirate off of.
[01:40:45.631 --> 01:40:47.772]  The studies show they grow faster, they're healthy.
[01:40:48.032 --> 01:40:50.233]  There's a blooming with higher CO2.
[01:40:50.273 --> 01:40:51.213]  CO2 is very low.
[01:40:51.233 --> 01:40:54.774]  But I'm going to tie it all together with the 5G.
[01:40:56.587 --> 01:41:07.892]  And the fact that it's a human right not to be bombarded and attacked with this, and it's also a human right to say no, whether it was bad for you or not, which we know it is.
[01:41:08.372 --> 01:41:13.334]  California schools are pulling the 5G and other cell towers out.
[01:41:14.315 --> 01:41:17.036]  I played the newscast where 20% of the school got cancer.
[01:41:19.177 --> 01:41:20.017]  I'm going to explain this again.
[01:41:20.097 --> 01:41:21.978]  I've had medical doctors on, but everybody knows this.
[01:41:22.498 --> 01:41:22.819]  In the 1950s and 60s,
[01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:32.682]  If there was a child with cancer, doctors got on planes from all over the world, cancer doctors, to go look at them.
[01:41:32.762 --> 01:41:34.403]  It was like finding a unicorn or something.
[01:41:36.944 --> 01:41:38.844]  This is being done by design, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:38.884 --> 01:41:45.187]  The whole environmental movement has nothing to do with saving the earth or fixing things or making it good for humans and animals.
[01:41:45.647 --> 01:41:50.309]  It's about power grabbing and setting themselves up as the arbiters over who can control what.
[01:41:51.499 --> 01:41:55.000]  And over who can farm, or who can build a barn, or who can have cows.
[01:41:55.020 --> 01:41:56.160]  They want to put taxes on cows.
[01:41:56.461 --> 01:41:57.161]  Taxes on meat.
[01:41:57.221 --> 01:41:58.101]  Now it's all being announced.
[01:41:58.121 --> 01:41:59.701]  They're saying, get ready to eat bugs.
[01:42:02.222 --> 01:42:03.363]  You can't have a good life.
[01:42:03.543 --> 01:42:04.603]  You can't fly on an airplane.
[01:42:05.403 --> 01:42:14.486]  But Leonardo DiCaprio and Prince Harry and all these other people, they can fly around on private jets all day long to lecture you how you shouldn't have children and how there's too many of you.
[01:42:15.806 --> 01:42:18.247]  And there are overpopulated areas and some things are toxic.
[01:42:19.587 --> 01:42:21.028]  But they're trying to make us dumber.
[01:42:22.588 --> 01:42:25.149]  Well, they themselves live like a bunch of kings at our expense.
[01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:28.710]  And we need to not put up with it.
[01:42:28.730 --> 01:42:31.992]  So yes, Matt Drudge realizes how important this is about 5G.
[01:42:32.512 --> 01:42:33.732]  He knows they're trying to shut us down.
[01:42:34.172 --> 01:42:35.913]  He knows this is a public service announcement.
[01:42:36.233 --> 01:42:37.073]  So he tweeted us out.
[01:42:37.754 --> 01:42:38.414]  He has courage.
[01:42:38.894 --> 01:42:40.935]  You know, they say, oh, we might ban you if you tweet Alex Jones.
[01:42:40.975 --> 01:42:42.576]  Well, they're going to ban everybody anyways.
[01:42:43.036 --> 01:42:45.697]  Don't let the thought police control everything you say and do.
[01:42:46.377 --> 01:42:49.139]  Because at the start of the next hour, we're going to play a powerful Tucker Carlson on that point.
[01:42:49.159 --> 01:42:51.160]  And we have a special guest joining us as well.
[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:52.581]  InfoWars.com.
[01:42:52.821 --> 01:42:53.602]  Forward slash show.
[01:42:54.102 --> 01:42:54.763]  We're still on air.
[01:42:54.803 --> 01:42:56.184]  We're still reaching millions thanks to you.
[01:42:56.424 --> 01:42:57.544]  Please spread the word today.
[01:42:58.345 --> 01:43:01.047]  Please get the word out like Matt Drudge just did at DrudgeReport.com.
[01:43:02.568 --> 01:43:04.189]  Without... InfoWars.
[01:43:07.509 --> 01:43:10.232]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:43:10.552 --> 01:43:13.676]  The British ended up being the most powerful empire in the world.
[01:43:13.796 --> 01:43:15.217]  Not because the Spanish couldn't fight.
[01:43:15.317 --> 01:43:16.839]  Not because the Portuguese couldn't fight.
[01:43:16.959 --> 01:43:19.462]  Not because the Austrian-Hungarian Empire couldn't fight.
[01:43:19.522 --> 01:43:21.724]  You ever wonder why British are called limeys?
[01:43:22.065 --> 01:43:24.407]  The British ended up getting basically key limes.
[01:43:25.328 --> 01:43:35.495]  When they went into the Caribbean 500 years ago, and they had their captains right, and their ship's doctors, how long sailors survived, what climates, they were trying to figure out what's making sickness.
[01:43:35.515 --> 01:43:38.658]  They weren't sure if it was hot air or why they got close to the shore.
[01:43:38.798 --> 01:43:40.499]  More of their sailors would die in a couple days.
[01:43:40.619 --> 01:43:42.360]  And they figured out pretty quick it was mosquitoes.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:45.002]  But the British classified that 400 years ago.
[01:43:45.042 --> 01:43:46.844]  So the British would always lay off the coast.
[01:43:47.064 --> 01:43:49.726]  And foreigners would ask, why did the Brits lay off the coast?
[01:43:49.826 --> 01:43:50.526]  They don't want mosquitoes.
[01:43:50.746 --> 01:43:51.447]  And then they'd get all the
[01:43:51.867 --> 01:43:54.148]  The fevers, the malaria that came with mosquitoes.
[01:43:54.268 --> 01:43:56.929]  Well, the Brits also figured out with their scientists, limes.
[01:43:57.149 --> 01:43:58.770]  But the Brits were suspicious.
[01:43:58.810 --> 01:44:00.651]  The average sailor thought if you swim, you get sick.
[01:44:00.891 --> 01:44:03.232]  And they thought, you know, you don't want to eat vegetables, they make you sick.
[01:44:03.252 --> 01:44:05.032]  This is what people actually thought back then.
[01:44:05.853 --> 01:44:08.954]  So they would put the limes in the grog.
[01:44:09.514 --> 01:44:10.255]  Which is, what's grog?
[01:44:10.395 --> 01:44:11.756]  One-third rum, two-thirds water.
[01:44:11.976 --> 01:44:13.337]  To make sure they would at least drink their water.
[01:44:13.377 --> 01:44:16.720]  Part of their pay, their daily ration for good behavior, was grog.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:21.923]  So on the job, all sailors, Spanish, Russian, it didn't matter, they were paid in alcohol.
[01:44:22.064 --> 01:44:23.705]  And part of their daily food was alcohol.
[01:44:23.745 --> 01:44:28.889]  So the British would start putting, 400 years ago, limes in the alcohol, the grog.
[01:44:29.069 --> 01:44:34.853]  And so, what would happen when they were a thousand miles from home and ran up against a Spanish frigate twice their size?
[01:44:34.993 --> 01:44:37.055]  Well, the Spanish, all their teeth had fallen out.
[01:44:37.155 --> 01:44:38.396]  They had cuts all over them.
[01:44:38.596 --> 01:44:40.377]  Open wounds.
[01:44:40.557 --> 01:44:41.638]  No fresh vegetables.
[01:44:41.658 --> 01:44:55.346]  No vitamin C. Well, notice the British for 200 years could keep it secret that limes were... And so it was a joke to all the other armies that there were bags of limes and obsessions with limes and powdered lime powder to put in.
[01:44:55.626 --> 01:45:01.670]  And they would put it in the grog to make them drink it because they knew our troops are ready to fight.
[01:45:02.290 --> 01:45:05.453]  Because they've got vitamin C. So I'm going into a plug here, but here's the deal.
[01:45:05.653 --> 01:45:10.938]  Every study, Linus Pauling won two Nobel Prizes for vitamin C. So these are the things that are known.
[01:45:11.059 --> 01:45:14.742]  If you think vitamin C is powerful, the stuff at DNA Force is even beyond that.
[01:45:14.862 --> 01:45:15.923]  It's the next level of that.
[01:45:16.104 --> 01:45:16.864]  That's what we know.
[01:45:17.185 --> 01:45:20.608]  And when your body doesn't have the good halogen of iodine,
[01:45:20.708 --> 01:45:21.608]  It uses the bad halogen.
[01:45:21.769 --> 01:45:25.070]  And at a certain point, the cells are using toxic chemicals to survive.
[01:45:25.290 --> 01:45:28.392]  They start mutating so they can use that and not die.
[01:45:28.712 --> 01:45:31.434]  But then they take over your body and you die from cancer.
[01:45:31.534 --> 01:45:38.918]  And so, so much of the deformity and the mental illness and the low IQs and everything is that people have vitamin and mineral deficiencies.
[01:45:39.118 --> 01:45:41.219]  And they work around the clock with all these fake reports.
[01:45:41.239 --> 01:45:42.400]  Oh, you don't need vitamins.
[01:45:42.420 --> 01:45:43.240]  You don't need minerals.
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:45.401]  You don't need... And they lower the amount you're supposed to take.
[01:45:45.481 --> 01:45:48.443]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:46:04.795 --> 01:46:09.659]  Casey, I'm sure it's wishful thinking you're saying, Tyra comes back from nowhere, is he on turbo force?
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:14.283]  Which is an amazing pre-workout and long-term energy system, unlike any other.
[01:46:14.884 --> 01:46:17.186]  Or Tyra Woods isn't actually taking turbo force, is he?
[01:46:17.426 --> 01:46:18.227]  That's a good idea, though.
[01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:19.147]  I should try to send him some.
[01:46:19.608 --> 01:46:22.110]  I'm not entirely sure, but when I was watching the Masters,
[01:46:22.270 --> 01:46:23.171]  I'll have to try to find out.
[01:46:23.191 --> 01:46:23.411]  I know.
[01:46:23.431 --> 01:46:25.733]  I've been told by multiple folks that are friends with him.
[01:46:25.753 --> 01:46:28.216]  He's a listener, but I don't really worry about stuff like that.
[01:46:28.236 --> 01:46:29.076]  But that's great.
[01:46:29.137 --> 01:46:29.717]  Who knows?
[01:46:29.757 --> 01:46:30.998]  He might be on Turbo Force.
[01:46:31.018 --> 01:46:31.519]  Who knows?
[01:46:44.451 --> 01:46:50.513]  Well, last year, when he won his first tournament in a long time, they tried to grill him on, like, degrading the president in some way.
[01:46:50.553 --> 01:46:53.714]  You know, this is what you need in a press conference after a golf tournament, and he wouldn't do it.
[01:46:53.814 --> 01:46:54.854]  I know, he's friends with Trump.
[01:46:54.894 --> 01:46:56.254]  He's been friends with Trump, like, 20 years.
[01:46:56.394 --> 01:46:57.055]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:57.075 --> 01:46:58.715]  The media wasn't even talking about his win.
[01:46:58.735 --> 01:47:00.255]  They were talking about his politics.
[01:47:00.275 --> 01:47:00.916]  Thank you, Casey.
[01:47:06.177 --> 01:47:08.778]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:37.145 --> 01:47:38.366]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:38.506 --> 01:47:40.328]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:47:40.568 --> 01:47:41.950]  We'll put up on screen for TV viewers.
[01:47:42.410 --> 01:47:52.539]  Matt Drudge has put a tweet out pointing out that I spent the last hour and a half of the broadcast focused on the dangers, the admitted dangers of 5G.
[01:47:53.941 --> 01:47:56.643]  Alex Jones devoting his entire broadcast to the dangers of 5G.
[01:47:56.723 --> 01:47:58.265]  Fascinating, riveting, frightening.
[01:47:58.345 --> 01:47:59.426]  Watch your brain.
[01:48:01.307 --> 01:48:02.789]  And again, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:48:03.985 --> 01:48:07.006]  A lot of people are scared to tweet our stuff even though it doesn't really get you banned.
[01:48:07.546 --> 01:48:09.147]  Facebook will warn you they might ban you.
[01:48:09.867 --> 01:48:14.908]  But how dangerous is that when they try to take control of words and then tell you who you can point somebody at?
[01:48:14.928 --> 01:48:23.671]  And then they have hundreds of articles out every day about how Alex Jones is bad and he's a horrible person and Joe Rogan shouldn't have him on.
[01:48:24.471 --> 01:48:28.212]  They had a big Atlantic article because I went on there and said nobody died at Sandy Hook.
[01:48:28.812 --> 01:48:31.213]  I went on there and said people died at Sandy Hook.
[01:48:32.819 --> 01:48:34.680]  And that the media had misrepresented what I said.
[01:48:34.960 --> 01:48:36.761]  But even if I said that, it's my right to say it.
[01:48:38.462 --> 01:48:49.528]  And then, The Atlantic wrote this huge Joe Rogan piece, and I'm in there like eight times, and at the end of it, it says, Joe Rogan shouldn't have had him on to attack the poor families.
[01:48:49.548 --> 01:48:59.513]  They just use those families to try to shut down everything we're doing, when all we're doing is covering the 5G
[01:49:01.827 --> 01:49:12.050]  And the fluoride in the water and the glyphosates and everything that's unfolding and everything that's happening.
[01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:16.711]  Now, let me go ahead and run through and just recap what's happening.
[01:49:18.891 --> 01:49:25.173]  The establishment, the scientific elite that Eisenhower warned us of, you know, he didn't, in his farewell address in 1961, just say,
[01:49:31.738 --> 01:49:37.802]  Beware the military-industrial complex and its undue influence and controlling 90% of the universities.
[01:49:38.182 --> 01:49:39.823]  He wasn't talking about the military.
[01:49:40.744 --> 01:49:49.729]  He was talking about the powerful interests that were getting control of it and how almost all research was under their control.
[01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:52.511]  You guys have the right one, okay?
[01:49:52.531 --> 01:49:53.492]  Leave that on screen, thank you.
[01:49:54.272 --> 01:49:58.415]  Now, I'm here directing some.
[01:50:02.318 --> 01:50:30.223]  We know that they know that when they invented radar in 1943 in the United States and England, that people that stood in front of a regular powered radar dish, at that time very weak, for just a few hours would get serious health effects and would usually die within a year.
[01:50:32.423 --> 01:50:35.464]  I've interviewed radio operators from the U.S.
[01:50:35.544 --> 01:50:46.569]  Army and from the Air Force that ran these radar towers that they'd put their can of beans in front of it on, say, a stool.
[01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:49.231]  It was pointed off the top of a mountain in one case.
[01:50:49.831 --> 01:50:52.092]  And in 20 minutes, they'd go open the can of beans.
[01:50:52.152 --> 01:50:55.593]  It'd be 100 degrees up on a freezing mountaintop.
[01:50:55.613 --> 01:51:00.075]  That particular story was told by a local Austinite friend of mine.
[01:51:00.095 --> 01:51:01.256]  We ought to get him back on sometime.
[01:51:03.752 --> 01:51:13.454]  About when he was in Kenya on a secret mission with a radar tower up there that they were tracking Russians with, but it's a side issue.
[01:51:13.474 --> 01:51:17.334]  They would heat their lunches on a freezing mountaintop.
[01:51:17.354 --> 01:51:25.256]  It wasn't Kenya, it was Ethiopia.
[01:51:25.376 --> 01:51:25.856]  Ethiopia.
[01:51:26.356 --> 01:51:27.116]  They've got mountains there.
[01:51:28.396 --> 01:51:29.377]  But that's just an example.
[01:51:29.897 --> 01:51:31.197]  If it's heating beans,
[01:51:32.105 --> 01:51:33.585]  It's cooking your brain.
[01:51:38.467 --> 01:51:42.728]  Now, I consider and give you anecdotal stuff all day, but let's just look at the mainstream news today.
[01:51:44.088 --> 01:51:50.450]  CNET News and others, Chicago Tribune, they're all reporting smartphones may be leaking more radiation than we think.
[01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:51.990]  You think, oh, they're finally telling us the truth.
[01:51:52.571 --> 01:52:01.333]  Then you read it and it says smartphones are leaking way above what is allowable, not safe, and the allowable levels give rats brain cancer.
[01:52:02.688 --> 01:52:03.288]  Don't believe me?
[01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:05.870]  I'll show you Wired Magazine here.
[01:52:07.831 --> 01:52:09.332]  5G smartphones cause cancer.
[01:52:09.392 --> 01:52:10.673]  Big Wireless doesn't want you to know.
[01:52:10.993 --> 01:52:13.075]  Wired Magazine goes through all the studies.
[01:52:13.975 --> 01:52:14.776]  This is not debatable.
[01:52:17.958 --> 01:52:29.666]  And as I said, meanwhile, they've got the establishment all over the world creating very hidden, very exclusive communities with international and federal
[01:52:32.284 --> 01:52:38.010]  Prohibitions on any type of transmitter device.
[01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:40.352]  But then you turn on Netflix.
[01:52:40.452 --> 01:52:41.914]  I mean, I try to watch shows.
[01:52:42.414 --> 01:52:51.063]  And in between the race war stuff, it's whether it's Better Call Saul, or there's always a crazy neighbor that thinks cell towers are hurting him.
[01:52:52.236 --> 01:52:54.197]  And then they run outside and, oh, there's a cell tower!
[01:52:54.297 --> 01:52:54.817]  Oh, I'm sick!
[01:52:54.877 --> 01:52:55.417]  It's getting me!
[01:52:56.077 --> 01:52:58.758]  Well, they've proven there's allergies to electromagnetic radiation.
[01:52:59.518 --> 01:53:00.959]  They've proven it's killing honeybees.
[01:53:00.979 --> 01:53:04.580]  They've proven it's messing up their navigation and hurting birds.
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:08.281]  They've proven it's hurting foliage around high-powered cell towers.
[01:53:11.087 --> 01:53:14.630]  I mean, I have been on talk radio for 25 years.
[01:53:14.690 --> 01:53:19.553]  And I remember talking to engineers back then saying, cell phones give you cancer.
[01:53:19.573 --> 01:53:20.574]  I've got an article saying they do.
[01:53:20.594 --> 01:53:25.798]  And they're like, son, in the old days, they used to have the transmitters at the stations.
[01:53:25.978 --> 01:53:26.978]  You don't see that anywhere.
[01:53:26.998 --> 01:53:27.459]  You know why?
[01:53:27.479 --> 01:53:32.702]  And he goes, you can cook your lunch next to a AM or FM transmitter.
[01:53:37.826 --> 01:53:38.807]  And later I learned that from
[01:53:40.134 --> 01:53:40.874]  Radar operators.
[01:53:41.835 --> 01:53:43.875]  So again, this is known.
[01:53:43.975 --> 01:53:44.756]  It's been known.
[01:53:45.236 --> 01:53:48.877]  So now we're going to put up hundreds of thousands in the first phase.
[01:53:48.897 --> 01:53:50.058]  Later they say millions.
[01:53:51.418 --> 01:53:58.441]  I saw some estimate of 10 million 5G transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[01:54:00.582 --> 01:54:05.824]  And Trump's all excited about it because it would be millions of jobs.
[01:54:08.578 --> 01:54:11.540]  Well, Trump, those aren't jobs we need.
[01:54:13.022 --> 01:54:23.530]  So let me tie that in to this, because if you're a TV viewer, you can see the New York Times article from June 21st from Green Bank, West Virginia, The Land Where Internet Ends.
[01:54:25.292 --> 01:54:33.639]  And you read this big 14-page article, and they tell you, oh, it's so it doesn't mess up the SETI satellite and the DISH.
[01:54:35.353 --> 01:54:40.575]  Because if you've got anything transmitting, it fogs up the receiver trying to make contact with aliens.
[01:54:42.956 --> 01:54:52.380]  But really, what it is, is a massive tens of thousands of square miles in between two mountains.
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:59.803]  So those big thick mountains, those marble granite mountains, are blocking all the radiation around it.
[01:55:02.284 --> 01:55:03.945]  And then there's no radiation allowed within it.
[01:55:04.485 --> 01:55:05.706]  And they say it's so peaceful.
[01:55:08.047 --> 01:55:08.907]  And it's so nice.
[01:55:09.067 --> 01:55:12.449]  And that, again, all these ultra-rich people are living there.
[01:55:12.489 --> 01:55:12.869]  Why?
[01:55:13.810 --> 01:55:17.011]  Well, they're building other facilities like this around the world.
[01:55:18.752 --> 01:55:23.995]  There are communities, it just so happens, in Kauai, where they're getting the locals to get together and vote.
[01:55:25.255 --> 01:55:27.056]  And guess whose house is right by it?
[01:55:27.656 --> 01:55:30.498]  Mark Zuckerberg bought thousands of acres.
[01:55:31.636 --> 01:55:32.857]  Try to take native land, but failed.
[01:55:33.538 --> 01:55:37.761]  And they're pushing an initiative to not have 5G, and to take cell towers out.
[01:55:40.023 --> 01:55:43.145]  And magically, wherever these ultra-rich are, they're pulling it out.
[01:55:46.307 --> 01:55:46.688]  Look it up.
[01:55:47.628 --> 01:55:55.875]  But where the general public is, or where your school is, here, we'll stick a bunch of regular 3G, 4G cell phone, and then we'll stick this up on top of your house.
[01:55:58.177 --> 01:55:59.077]  And it just goes on.
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:05.505]  From there, so I'm begging everyone to go look at this for yourself.
[01:56:05.745 --> 01:56:09.709]  You know, why doesn't Trump want the Chinese Huawei in?
[01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:12.011]  Well, it's state-run.
[01:56:12.031 --> 01:56:14.993]  The lady that heads it's father is like the number three guy in the Communist Party.
[01:56:15.494 --> 01:56:17.255]  It's the second biggest cell phone company in the world.
[01:56:17.956 --> 01:56:20.799]  It's already set up things all over rural America at cost.
[01:56:20.839 --> 01:56:22.100]  It's giving it to us at cost.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.182]  Look out for something that's free, folks.
[01:56:25.353 --> 01:56:38.300]  Because they can scoop up and steal data with it, and it can break through defenses, it can scan through, and it's so strong, it can pick up and suck up, like a vacuum cleaner, everything you're doing, including your passcodes, you name it.
[01:56:38.721 --> 01:56:39.321]  Now, the U.S.
[01:56:39.381 --> 01:56:42.203]  government's doing that too, and that's bad enough, and I don't want that to happen.
[01:56:44.724 --> 01:56:46.145]  But the takeover was almost complete.
[01:56:46.205 --> 01:56:47.866]  Remember the Reuters article, now a year ago?
[01:56:48.846 --> 01:56:49.287]  Over a year ago?
[01:56:50.948 --> 01:56:55.331]  Apple moves to China to get zero tax and gives them the code keys to the Apple Cloud.
[01:56:56.691 --> 01:57:06.877]  So they've got the code to your devices, they've got everything they can get into your phone, whatever they want, and they're putting in systems that can then broadcast and dial into your phone and take control of it.
[01:57:07.778 --> 01:57:08.638]  And that's all admitted.
[01:57:12.561 --> 01:57:14.482]  The original 5G is the smart meter.
[01:57:15.462 --> 01:57:17.984]  When they first started talking about smart meters 20 years ago,
[01:57:20.925 --> 01:57:25.495]  They admitted that they were going to use it to control your thermostat.
[01:57:25.736 --> 01:57:27.199]  And I've got articles I'll show you when we come back.
[01:57:29.768 --> 01:57:33.091]  Forget them recommending 78 to 82 while you sleep.
[01:57:33.751 --> 01:57:38.175]  I'll show you where they say they're already controlling it in some municipalities.
[01:57:38.516 --> 01:57:41.258]  And those smart meters are nothing but 5G.
[01:57:41.819 --> 01:57:45.542]  And they're grabbing everything going on in your house and everywhere else.
[01:57:46.583 --> 01:57:50.687]  And, oh don't forget, they're transmitting and frying you all at the same time.
[01:57:52.128 --> 01:58:06.195]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who actually worked for a living, that would end up saving the nation.
[01:58:06.435 --> 01:58:08.976]  And today, the communist Chinese have banned all U.S.
[01:58:09.356 --> 01:58:10.457]  farming goods a week ago.
[01:58:11.117 --> 01:58:14.759]  And we've seen massive increases in polls to support for the president.
[01:58:15.419 --> 01:58:19.322]  And what he's doing in this trade war wants China to put pressure on our farmers.
[01:58:19.962 --> 01:58:20.543]  That's beautiful.
[01:58:21.003 --> 01:58:22.544]  Americans aren't going to be bullied.
[01:58:22.904 --> 01:58:23.905]  And we aren't going to back down.
[01:58:24.505 --> 01:58:31.870]  So to the Joaquin Cruises and the Hillary Clintons of the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up.
[01:58:32.110 --> 01:58:34.052]  And all you've done is awaken the human spirit.
[01:58:34.432 --> 01:58:38.295]  And the human spirit lives at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:58:38.575 --> 01:58:39.516]  And I'm asking listeners,
[01:58:40.336 --> 01:58:44.120]  Whatever you do, spread those links, because we are the light in the dark of the night.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:45.301]  We are the resistance.
[01:58:45.541 --> 01:58:47.884]  We are 1776 Worldwide.
[01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:58.715]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:59:00.017 --> 01:59:08.619]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:20.342]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[01:59:21.063 --> 01:59:25.264]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[01:59:26.184 --> 01:59:29.386]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[01:59:30.207 --> 01:59:35.291]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[01:59:37.112 --> 01:59:39.234]  Order now at the InfoWars store.
[01:59:40.034 --> 01:59:49.741]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:59:54.901 --> 01:59:59.003]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:59.503 --> 02:00:00.843]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:04.985 --> 02:00:16.589]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:16.649 --> 02:00:23.172]  Coming up, we've got a great political activist who's been jailed herself for exposing Islamic pedo rings that have been convicted.
[02:00:23.905 --> 02:00:33.374]  Don't forget, Tommy Robinson has now been in prison for like a month for covering a child grooming kidnapping ring where they convicted a bunch of Muslims.
[02:00:34.635 --> 02:00:41.902]  They were given lighter sentences for grooming and raping little girls and selling them into sex slavery that he was given.
[02:00:43.503 --> 02:00:46.967]  Yeah, that's what runs the British aristocracy is a bunch of dirty pedophiles.
[02:00:49.448 --> 02:00:52.450]  In fact, pull up all the royal family that got caught at Epstein's house.
[02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:53.310]  There's even photos of it.
[02:00:53.691 --> 02:00:54.691]  I want to get to that next segment.
[02:00:55.232 --> 02:00:56.973]  And we'll get back into 5G and all of it.
[02:00:57.013 --> 02:01:04.818]  But I was saying during the break... What was I saying during the break?
[02:01:04.838 --> 02:01:06.579]  Because I had two meetings during that two-minute break.
[02:01:07.535 --> 02:01:19.846]  And I don't normally, it'll pop back in my head in a moment, but Deu was in here showing me all these stacks of news of new convicted pedophile drag queens running Drag Queen Storytime, and then I had somebody else in my ear, and I said, when I come back, I'm gonna hit this.
[02:01:19.906 --> 02:01:20.626]  Can anybody remember?
[02:01:22.027 --> 02:01:25.671]  Cuz that's, now I know Joe Rogan's at 6 After.
[02:01:27.312 --> 02:01:32.757]  I know that, but that's, I'm not mad everybody comes in and talks to me during the breaks, but I just have to write notes constantly then.
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:35.801]  Because the listeners all know what I said I was going to hit.
[02:01:36.862 --> 02:01:38.403]  But they're robbing our attention span.
[02:01:39.384 --> 02:01:40.484]  Smart meters, thank you.
[02:01:40.644 --> 02:01:41.805]  Oh, it's the folder right in front of me.
[02:01:43.646 --> 02:01:44.427]  Look at that right there.
[02:01:44.687 --> 02:01:50.151]  That is a graphic on the wall of an MRI.
[02:01:50.311 --> 02:01:59.717]  They've added a phone onto the graphic of what an average cell phone microwave transmitter receiver does when it's up against your head.
[02:02:01.926 --> 02:02:16.290]  And again, it raises the overall brain temperature one degree while it's happening, but they can also turn on a high-powered function with it and have it scan your house by its waves it sends out that bounce back.
[02:02:16.850 --> 02:02:23.872]  And they can also, between cell phones, bounce it between cell towers and get a complete 360 view of everything happening in real time.
[02:02:24.772 --> 02:02:29.393]  What was the Batman movie that came out, the one before last?
[02:02:30.632 --> 02:02:31.953]  And it's where he's going to beat the Joker.
[02:02:32.614 --> 02:02:38.478]  And they go, they said, we have this technology, but it's big brother.
[02:02:38.538 --> 02:02:40.379]  They said, we'll only use it this once.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:42.561]  Morgan Freedman was in it.
[02:02:43.802 --> 02:02:48.846]  And they use the technology to access everyone's cell phones and have them broadcast on high power.
[02:02:49.606 --> 02:02:55.711]  And it creates a map of everything going on so they can hear and see where the Joker and the hostages are.
[02:02:57.272 --> 02:02:58.173]  That's actually real.
[02:02:59.431 --> 02:03:08.613]  And an hour ago, I pulled up MIT Quarterly showing how cell phones and Kinect and all these other systems in your house aren't just receiver transmitters.
[02:03:09.013 --> 02:03:10.034]  They can blurp.
[02:03:10.814 --> 02:03:11.754]  Blurp technology.
[02:03:12.374 --> 02:03:13.194]  That's what they actually call it.
[02:03:14.915 --> 02:03:28.078]  And it just goes brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[02:03:29.824 --> 02:03:32.665]  And you know it listens to you, and it watches you, and that's all admitted.
[02:03:33.125 --> 02:03:34.186]  So, that's what I'm getting at.
[02:03:34.226 --> 02:03:36.267]  So, Smart Meters, here's some articles on that.
[02:03:37.847 --> 02:03:38.407]  Yeah, there's the scene.
[02:03:38.427 --> 02:03:39.328]  You guys found it in Batman.
[02:03:40.768 --> 02:03:43.249]  It's all them just getting us ready for it.
[02:03:43.450 --> 02:03:44.610]  All them just preparing it.
[02:03:44.630 --> 02:03:46.171]  You know, we're live now, but in post.
[02:03:47.951 --> 02:03:50.933]  At the end of this segment, let's just throw that on so folks in post can see it.
[02:03:51.273 --> 02:03:52.413]  Live radio listeners can go find it.
[02:03:52.433 --> 02:03:53.974]  In fact, what did you search to find that?
[02:03:54.850 --> 02:03:56.611]  Great job, Colonel, on how they did that in one minute.
[02:03:56.911 --> 02:03:59.013]  Because we're not pre-planning this, I'm just wandering around.
[02:03:59.493 --> 02:04:02.055]  Dark Night Cell Surveillance Trim.
[02:04:03.015 --> 02:04:03.475]  There you go.
[02:04:04.036 --> 02:04:10.500]  So, federal program wants you to cut your thermostat to 82 while you sleep.
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:11.680]  Well, here it is from years ago.
[02:04:12.141 --> 02:04:15.343]  Smart Meters Enforcement of Mandatory Water Restrictions is only just the beginning.
[02:04:15.783 --> 02:04:16.964]  Infowars.com from 2015.
[02:04:17.364 --> 02:04:21.847]  And we show all the statements, how they plan to control the thermostat inside your house.
[02:04:21.887 --> 02:04:23.388]  And I've got articles from 15 years ago.
[02:04:24.366 --> 02:04:25.487]  Why stop smart meters?
[02:04:25.507 --> 02:04:28.129]  Another big article on that from StopStartMeters.org.
[02:04:29.030 --> 02:04:32.794]  Yes, smart meters do enable utilities to remotely control your appliances.
[02:04:33.875 --> 02:04:34.896]  Maryland News.
[02:04:35.696 --> 02:04:36.577]  Public Health Warning.
[02:04:36.597 --> 02:04:38.239]  I've got a whole stack.
[02:04:40.220 --> 02:04:42.642]  I've got a whole stack right here of articles.
[02:04:43.123 --> 02:04:43.884]  Smart metering.
[02:04:43.924 --> 02:04:46.106]  Utilities net link to your home's thermostat.
[02:04:46.586 --> 02:04:48.087]  How they plan to take control of your thermostat.
[02:04:48.127 --> 02:04:49.569]  That's from six years ago.
[02:04:50.582 --> 02:04:53.723]  It just goes on and on and on how they admit the whole thing.
[02:04:53.743 --> 02:05:00.966]  It's called the Total Panopticonic Surveillance Control Grid for Social Engineering to Build a Post-Human World.
[02:05:03.087 --> 02:05:03.728]  The Globalist.
[02:05:05.548 --> 02:05:09.170]  Donald Trump presents Real Stable Genius.
[02:05:13.457 --> 02:05:17.360]  Today, we salute you, Mrs. Social Justice Warrior.
[02:05:20.283 --> 02:05:22.965]  What do you do with a master's degree in gender studies?
[02:05:23.405 --> 02:05:27.909]  Put on a vagina hat and go fight fascism on the internet.
[02:05:28.169 --> 02:05:31.032]  As soon as you wake up each day, the outrage begins.
[02:05:31.452 --> 02:05:32.613]  What the f*** did you just say?
[02:05:32.893 --> 02:05:34.315]  Your privilege is showing, and...
[02:05:35.882 --> 02:05:40.183]  Armed with only a keyboard, you tirelessly protect America from fake racism.
[02:05:40.483 --> 02:05:41.684]  And fake sexism.
[02:05:41.824 --> 02:05:44.525]  And fake, some other word we've never even heard of, ism.
[02:05:44.645 --> 02:05:47.005]  I need a trigger warning, please!
[02:05:47.045 --> 02:05:51.246]  So, crack open a nice soy latte, miss purple-haired vagina costume wearer.
[02:05:51.567 --> 02:05:53.447]  You live by life's two greatest rules.
[02:05:53.887 --> 02:05:54.727]  Unch Nazis.
[02:05:55.088 --> 02:05:57.168]  And everyone I don't like is a Nazi.
[02:05:57.208 --> 02:05:58.449]  Mrs. Social Justice Warrior!
[02:05:58.489 --> 02:06:03.070]  Donald Trump, President Forever, Washington, D.C.
[02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:19.330]  I've known Alex for, like, more than 20 years.
[02:06:19.490 --> 02:06:20.290]  I've hung out with that guy.
[02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:21.971]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[02:06:22.071 --> 02:06:23.853]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[02:06:23.933 --> 02:06:25.754]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein s***.
[02:06:26.074 --> 02:06:27.615]  That is a f***ing fact.
[02:06:27.795 --> 02:06:30.197]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:06:30.417 --> 02:06:33.279]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[02:06:33.499 --> 02:06:36.402]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[02:06:36.702 --> 02:06:42.809]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:06:42.989 --> 02:06:48.074]  Alex Jones supported President Trump but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[02:06:48.194 --> 02:06:53.179]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[02:06:53.339 --> 02:06:55.482]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just
[02:06:55.982 --> 02:06:56.202]  Yeah.
[02:06:56.342 --> 02:06:58.504]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:06:58.704 --> 02:07:00.765]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:07:00.845 --> 02:07:02.626]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:07:02.846 --> 02:07:06.629]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[02:07:06.729 --> 02:07:08.890]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:11.892]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:07:12.192 --> 02:07:16.075]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[02:07:16.875 --> 02:07:23.643]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[02:07:23.863 --> 02:07:25.044]  The government's poisoning the water?
[02:07:25.465 --> 02:07:26.066]  Absolutely.
[02:07:26.086 --> 02:07:34.996]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose it's poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make them more easily manageable.
[02:07:35.436 --> 02:07:37.857]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one.
[02:07:38.057 --> 02:07:39.957]  He's fighting back against my takeover.
[02:07:40.298 --> 02:07:42.218]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[02:07:42.418 --> 02:07:45.479]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[02:07:45.639 --> 02:07:48.380]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:53.262]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[02:07:53.462 --> 02:07:55.382]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[02:07:55.602 --> 02:07:57.243]  Jones says there's a world government.
[02:07:57.323 --> 02:07:59.244]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[02:07:59.484 --> 02:07:59.784]  It is.
[02:07:59.804 --> 02:08:00.684]  On and on and on.
[02:08:01.244 --> 02:08:03.845]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[02:08:04.085 --> 02:08:10.529]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[02:08:11.089 --> 02:08:16.433]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Faruli, developed brain cancer.
[02:08:16.533 --> 02:08:19.835]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[02:08:20.275 --> 02:08:31.802]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[02:08:32.062 --> 02:08:48.401]  So think about how the LA Times, even Wired Magazine, will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves, cell phones,
[02:08:48.681 --> 02:08:52.002]  Operate as microwave transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[02:08:52.122 --> 02:08:53.222]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[02:08:53.242 --> 02:08:55.283]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[02:08:55.463 --> 02:09:00.384]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[02:09:00.404 --> 02:09:05.525]  That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[02:09:05.585 --> 02:09:06.225]  You heard me right.
[02:09:06.785 --> 02:09:09.006]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[02:09:09.546 --> 02:09:15.312]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[02:09:15.853 --> 02:09:28.927]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[02:09:29.627 --> 02:09:30.969]  What may have happened here?
[02:09:31.229 --> 02:09:34.131]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[02:09:34.872 --> 02:09:41.117]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[02:09:41.437 --> 02:09:50.644]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[02:09:50.925 --> 02:09:53.987]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[02:09:54.087 --> 02:09:55.888]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[02:09:55.908 --> 02:09:57.268]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[02:09:57.448 --> 02:09:59.849]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:10:00.370 --> 02:10:01.010]  Years ago.
[02:10:01.390 --> 02:10:08.693]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[02:10:08.753 --> 02:10:10.954]  He was talking about this years ago.
[02:10:11.094 --> 02:10:12.735]  Now it is mainstream news.
[02:10:18.277 --> 02:10:21.959]  And ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:10:23.322 --> 02:10:28.260]  And we have a special guest joining us that ties into all of this.
[02:10:30.512 --> 02:10:33.473]  She's been found guilty of thought crime in England now.
[02:10:33.773 --> 02:10:37.034]  She just was found guilty of thought crime, I'm told, in Ireland.
[02:10:37.214 --> 02:10:41.815]  Jada Franzen is a very well-spoken, awesome person.
[02:10:42.335 --> 02:10:45.376]  She's headed up one of the largest nationalist groups in the UK.
[02:10:45.896 --> 02:10:53.119]  She's also obviously friends with Tommy Robinson, who's been in prison for covering a child kidnapping ring that was convicted.
[02:10:53.719 --> 02:10:57.480]  So instead of being carried through the streets of England on people's shoulders,
[02:10:58.482 --> 02:11:00.423]  He's in prison again for the third time.
[02:11:02.004 --> 02:11:04.845]  But you read the Bible and you see what happened to all the saints.
[02:11:04.885 --> 02:11:06.146]  That's what happened to them.
[02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:11.288]  Christ says, if you love me, the world will hate you.
[02:11:12.129 --> 02:11:15.851]  Jada Franson is a British political activist and devout Christian.
[02:11:16.411 --> 02:11:19.853]  She practiced and studied law for many years prior to moving into political activism.
[02:11:20.693 --> 02:11:24.415]  And she was incarcerated last year for exposing four Muslims who gang raped a child.
[02:11:25.489 --> 02:11:29.610]  She served nine months in jail in England, six weeks to which was in solitary confinement.
[02:11:30.671 --> 02:11:31.151]  Did you hear that?
[02:11:32.671 --> 02:11:33.612]  Oh, yeah.
[02:11:33.912 --> 02:11:35.332]  People that made... Remember last week?
[02:11:35.352 --> 02:11:35.852]  Let's pull that up.
[02:11:35.872 --> 02:11:37.333]  The guy... It was a black guy.
[02:11:37.373 --> 02:11:38.313]  He had goofy looking hair.
[02:11:39.813 --> 02:11:40.474]  Mad scientist.
[02:11:40.514 --> 02:11:41.714]  He committed a horrible crime.
[02:11:43.415 --> 02:11:45.415]  They had a wanted poster out for him.
[02:11:46.035 --> 02:11:47.576]  And they had another poster of him.
[02:11:47.856 --> 02:11:49.697]  And they said, if you make fun of it, we'll arrest you.
[02:11:50.477 --> 02:11:54.018]  They're just always pushing the envelope, these fascists that call themselves liberal.
[02:11:55.586 --> 02:12:05.589]  Earlier this year, Jada was found guilty of multiple counts of hate speech for anti-terror speech she gave in Northern Ireland and is set to appeal her convictions on September 2nd.
[02:12:05.609 --> 02:12:06.650]  That's why she's in Ireland right now.
[02:12:07.450 --> 02:12:19.194]  In 2017, for being retweeted three times by President Donald Trump, Jada was accused of causing a breakdown in the relationship between Number 10 and the White House by MSM and was subsequently purged from Twitter.
[02:12:20.407 --> 02:12:23.589]  You can still find her at jadafranson.online.
[02:12:24.009 --> 02:12:30.194]  Celebrate these independent URLs like DrugsReport.com and DailyCaller.com and GatewayPundit.com.
[02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:37.542]  And NewsWars.com, and the great thing that Carpe D'Angem started, MeanMore.com, because we're going back to the decentralization.
[02:12:37.862 --> 02:12:39.402]  I wish I would have listened to Drudge more.
[02:12:39.663 --> 02:12:40.943]  We listen to some more than others.
[02:12:41.163 --> 02:12:42.103]  That's why we're still here.
[02:12:42.823 --> 02:12:43.824]  And the listeners understand that.
[02:12:43.904 --> 02:12:46.084]  So jadafranson.online, people should check that out.
[02:12:46.405 --> 02:12:47.485]  Jada, great to have you on.
[02:12:47.505 --> 02:12:51.246]  I think you've been on the shows before, but I've followed your work so long, it all blends together.
[02:12:51.606 --> 02:12:52.846]  But good to have you here with us.
[02:12:53.127 --> 02:12:54.347]  What do you want to tackle first?
[02:12:55.814 --> 02:12:56.715]  Well, hi, Alex.
[02:12:56.775 --> 02:12:57.936]  It's good to be on.
[02:12:58.216 --> 02:12:59.096]  I really don't know.
[02:12:59.116 --> 02:13:05.761]  I mean, I think there's just been so much going on since we were last in contact.
[02:13:05.821 --> 02:13:20.392]  And I think you and I are probably experiencing some of the same difficulties, you know, the censorship, being absolutely demonized and dehumanized by the state, the police state that we live in.
[02:13:21.092 --> 02:13:22.153]  It's absolutely chronic.
[02:13:23.720 --> 02:13:30.085]  I mean, Tommy is rotting in a dangerous prison, one of the worst high security prisons in the world right now.
[02:13:30.105 --> 02:13:33.847]  He's rotting in it for exposing pedophiles and getting them convicted.
[02:13:33.887 --> 02:13:38.971]  I mean, the pedophile problem itself, you got put in prison for it.
[02:13:39.011 --> 02:13:40.092]  Tell people briefly about that.
[02:13:41.533 --> 02:13:41.773]  Yeah.
[02:13:41.793 --> 02:13:46.316]  So last year I was, I was incarcerated for nine months.
[02:13:46.416 --> 02:13:49.238]  So basically just write the whole year off because I,
[02:13:50.758 --> 02:13:54.559]  They dared to go and expose a gang of Muslim rapists.
[02:13:54.819 --> 02:13:57.320]  A child went into a takeaway store, asked for directions.
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:00.921]  Instead of giving her directions, they kidnapped her and they raped her four times each.
[02:14:01.461 --> 02:14:03.142]  These men are now in jail.
[02:14:03.182 --> 02:14:04.882]  They're serving 14 years each.
[02:14:05.442 --> 02:14:11.204]  But because I went and notified the neighbours that these men were on bail, I was put in jail.
[02:14:11.224 --> 02:14:17.286]  They accused me, first of all, of incitement, and then they said that the charges were
[02:14:17.881 --> 02:14:30.026]  Causing these rapists harassment, alarm and distress by notifying the neighbours that they were still operating the takeaway shop that this child had been kidnapped and gang raped in.
[02:14:30.666 --> 02:14:31.166]  Exactly.
[02:14:31.186 --> 02:14:35.008]  It's almost like the blueprint of Tommy Robinson's case.
[02:14:35.948 --> 02:14:38.509]  Exposed gang rapist gets put in jail.
[02:14:39.991 --> 02:14:42.654]  Well, I was about to say, that's one of the reasons he's in prison for contempt.
[02:14:43.075 --> 02:14:47.019]  We've played the video many times, politely saying, you've been convicted, how do you feel?
[02:14:47.319 --> 02:14:49.802]  They tell him, screw your mother, you were born out your mother's ass.
[02:14:50.163 --> 02:14:53.186]  All these horrible things, I won't repeat, but that was some of the lighter stuff.
[02:14:53.687 --> 02:14:58.252]  And he just asked them politely, so he goes to jail for, what is it now, nine months or something.
[02:14:58.272 --> 02:14:59.934]  I mean, just like you got.
[02:15:00.939 --> 02:15:01.639]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:04.341]  I mean, fortunately, Tommy got nine months.
[02:15:04.361 --> 02:15:08.964]  He'll only have to serve approximately ten weeks, so he will be out next month.
[02:15:09.404 --> 02:15:11.846]  By the way, any word on how he's doing?
[02:15:11.866 --> 02:15:14.808]  Because I've got his cell phones and stuff, but his family is not in any of this.
[02:15:16.449 --> 02:15:16.929]  I apologize.
[02:15:17.549 --> 02:15:18.050]  Finish your point.
[02:15:18.070 --> 02:15:19.771]  When we come back, I'll ask if you have any word on Tommy.
[02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:29.814]  Yeah, no, I was just going to say, as you quite rightly pointed out, Tommy is being held in the most dangerous prison in the UK.
[02:15:30.094 --> 02:15:42.460]  Now this seems to be a strategy of the state, because they put me in a Cat A prison which is full of Islamic terrorists, one of whom was serving 15 years for plotting to cut my head off, along with Katie Hopkins.
[02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:45.462]  They're trying to give you a death sentence because
[02:15:46.636 --> 02:15:49.116]  I'm just saying, I mean, women like you is what's going to save the world.
[02:15:49.377 --> 02:15:51.737]  I'm not hitting on you, I'm married, but it's so sexy.
[02:15:52.257 --> 02:15:54.277]  I mean, you know, what you've done for your country and humanity.
[02:15:54.357 --> 02:15:57.578]  If we had women like you and men like you, we would not be in this problem.
[02:15:57.618 --> 02:15:59.218]  And people like Tommy, I just admire you.
[02:15:59.458 --> 02:16:00.038]  We'll be right back.
[02:16:00.058 --> 02:16:00.499]  Stay with us.
[02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:08.380]  This is history.
[02:16:09.380 --> 02:16:13.901]  We've got two Google engineers that have the courage to go public.
[02:16:14.827 --> 02:16:16.008]  The first one and the second one.
[02:16:16.108 --> 02:16:17.088]  Others have just leaked stuff.
[02:16:17.449 --> 02:16:25.494]  And they're there together interfacing for the first time live on an alternative system that Google and Facebook and Twitter and Apple didn't want to exist.
[02:16:25.634 --> 02:16:27.195]  They knew it would threaten them in the future.
[02:16:27.215 --> 02:16:29.757]  And it was here to challenge their information dominance.
[02:16:29.957 --> 02:16:30.957]  And history's happening.
[02:16:30.977 --> 02:16:37.782]  That's why listeners and viewers buying products, going to the store, getting things you already need at InfoWareStore.com is the reason this is happening.
[02:16:38.382 --> 02:16:39.343]  You guys have the floor.
[02:16:39.483 --> 02:16:45.307]  Both of you, Zach Voorhees on Twitter, Perpetual Maniac, Greg Coppola on Twitter for now, and Coppola underscore Gregory.
[02:16:45.347 --> 02:16:46.528]  What do you think's coming next?
[02:16:46.688 --> 02:16:47.688]  Why did you go public?
[02:16:47.788 --> 02:16:49.350]  Obviously more whistleblowers are coming.
[02:16:49.410 --> 02:16:51.811]  This is an amazing watershed moment, so go ahead and take over.
[02:16:51.871 --> 02:17:01.458]  Yeah, so it's about six years I was asleep within the company, and then the last two years it was fully awake, and that process started.
[02:17:02.058 --> 02:17:07.242]  And once it started, you know, I remember the last thing thinking to myself, what else are they lying about?
[02:17:08.042 --> 02:17:08.642]  And that was it.
[02:17:08.762 --> 02:17:09.082]  Wow.
[02:17:09.162 --> 02:17:09.843]  You know, bam.
[02:17:10.083 --> 02:17:10.883]  It just came.
[02:17:11.063 --> 02:17:19.286]  And for two years, I was really, really, really suffering being inside of YouTube and Google and seeing the company transform like this.
[02:17:19.546 --> 02:17:22.827]  I felt really guilty about drawing a salary.
[02:17:23.167 --> 02:17:27.068]  And I tried to let people know that this was coming.
[02:17:28.088 --> 02:17:34.833]  And now that I've released all of the information, I realize that I'm not part of that evil, evil system anymore.
[02:17:35.574 --> 02:17:42.158]  And it's very uplifting, and I feel that I can, you know, meet my maker at the very end.
[02:17:42.339 --> 02:17:45.741]  And when he says, you came across evil, what did you do?
[02:17:46.061 --> 02:17:53.887]  And I'll be able to, like, look him right in the eye and say, I sacrificed everything to let the American people know that the AI weapons were pointed directly at their mind.
[02:17:54.187 --> 02:18:01.796]  You know, I think when I was comfortably drawing my paycheck, I felt, you know, more comfortable, more certain.
[02:18:01.816 --> 02:18:06.662]  Now I feel there's definitely a lot of uncertainty, but I feel more alert.
[02:18:06.822 --> 02:18:12.889]  And obviously, you know, just the fact that I'm not anonymous kind of makes life a little more dangerous, which is kind of actually making me a little bit more awake.
[02:18:13.129 --> 02:18:17.091]  First of all, I'm really curious when they're gonna admit that Zach's leaks have happened.
[02:18:17.191 --> 02:18:18.952]  I mean, like, I mean, I'm talking about the mainstream media here.
[02:18:19.092 --> 02:18:27.977]  You know, that could be an interesting thing and just, like, what's gonna happen when they have to say, you know, this actually happened weeks ago, uh, that Zach leaked all these things and we just didn't tell you and these...
[02:18:28.497 --> 02:18:31.680]  You know, they're alleging that there's a system of censorship and we didn't tell you about it for two weeks.
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:34.422]  I mean, is that gonna kind of get anyone thinking?
[02:18:34.462 --> 02:18:34.883]  I don't know.
[02:18:35.764 --> 02:18:40.928]  And secondly, I think, you know, I would just underline that with Zach Stump, I mean, I think you've really seen everything now.
[02:18:40.988 --> 02:18:42.770]  It's all, I don't even think we need another leak.
[02:18:42.810 --> 02:18:49.135]  I mean, I'm sure some people are looking for it and some people might leak other things that are interesting, but I actually don't even think that we need anything else.
[02:18:49.195 --> 02:18:52.238]  And I think it's really important for consumers to just say, like,
[02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.931]  Uh, look, there's a bias.
[02:18:53.971 --> 02:18:54.451]  We can see it.
[02:18:54.491 --> 02:18:55.491]  Everything's set by hand.
[02:18:55.511 --> 02:18:56.852]  It's nothing to do with computers at all.
[02:18:57.452 --> 02:18:58.173]  And... Well, that's it.
[02:18:58.233 --> 02:19:02.255]  You just said something... God, I love talking to you guys with 150 IQs, 160 IQs.
[02:19:02.655 --> 02:19:14.962]  Because, exactly, everybody's always the next dump, the next piece, the next... What do you need when you have them saying blacklist and they've lied to Congress and said there aren't specific names, my names and others' names?
[02:19:15.102 --> 02:19:16.843]  It's all right there.
[02:19:16.923 --> 02:19:17.763]  We have them.
[02:19:17.983 --> 02:19:21.225]  It's a pile of smoky guns as big as Mount Everest is what you're saying.
[02:19:21.325 --> 02:19:29.411]  Yeah, I mean, it's kind of like the meme where there's like a dog in the building and everything's on fire and he's just, you know, saying, oh, yeah, everything's fine.
[02:19:29.472 --> 02:19:32.234]  You know, the American people have had a fire woken up in them.
[02:19:32.454 --> 02:19:37.258]  And I think that they're really going to, you know, have a conversation with the representative.
[02:19:37.738 --> 02:19:43.463]  And, you know, that representative is going to come back from recess and they're going to be energized.
[02:19:44.063 --> 02:19:45.924]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:32.054 --> 02:20:35.017]  Like the two dumb men together.
[02:20:35.057 --> 02:20:41.723]  No lesson learned, just keep chugging on, on, on.
[02:20:41.743 --> 02:20:52.533]  Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
[02:20:54.738 --> 02:21:07.685]  Ladies and gentlemen, she's got tons of these videos on her website of Islamists viciously attacking Brits
[02:21:23.626 --> 02:21:23.946]  We're good.
[02:21:42.325 --> 02:21:46.086]  Women and children being sold as slaves in at least six countries right now.
[02:21:46.266 --> 02:21:47.067]  But I'm digressing.
[02:21:47.527 --> 02:21:48.787]  She's a very well-spoken lady.
[02:21:48.947 --> 02:21:49.607]  She's amazing.
[02:21:49.968 --> 02:21:50.728]  Jada Franson.
[02:21:50.748 --> 02:21:52.908]  JadaFranson.online.
[02:21:53.028 --> 02:21:54.329]  Everybody bookmark it and share it.
[02:21:54.989 --> 02:21:56.390]  And there's so many of these heroes.
[02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:58.410]  I wanted her on like a year ago, but I guess she was in jail.
[02:21:58.430 --> 02:21:59.090]  That's why I couldn't get her.
[02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.731]  I'm like, get her on!
[02:21:59.751 --> 02:22:00.291]  She's amazing.
[02:22:00.831 --> 02:22:01.571]  Oh, she's in jail.
[02:22:02.191 --> 02:22:05.873]  But she's here now, and you've just been convicted again in Ireland, I'm told.
[02:22:05.893 --> 02:22:06.553]  You're appealing that.
[02:22:07.233 --> 02:22:09.234]  But just recap what it's like over there.
[02:22:09.254 --> 02:22:11.535]  Because I have family that goes to England quite often.
[02:22:11.836 --> 02:22:12.896]  I've been there four or five times.
[02:22:13.376 --> 02:22:14.077]  I guess more than that.
[02:22:14.157 --> 02:22:16.438]  But London's a no-go zone.
[02:22:16.638 --> 02:22:19.600]  And now it's even mainstream news that much of Europe's a no-go zone.
[02:22:20.220 --> 02:22:23.422]  And that even if black rappers go in there, Islamists just attack them.
[02:22:23.742 --> 02:22:25.443]  I mean, because they understand tribalism.
[02:22:25.483 --> 02:22:26.624]  They understand taking over.
[02:22:27.004 --> 02:22:29.666]  That's what Islam has done in 1400 years.
[02:22:30.186 --> 02:22:32.007]  It took over half the world already.
[02:22:35.086 --> 02:22:38.129]  Yeah, London is, London's completely gone.
[02:22:38.669 --> 02:22:40.351]  London's my hometown, right?
[02:22:40.431 --> 02:22:43.834]  So, and I have to say, you hit the nail on the head there.
[02:22:43.914 --> 02:22:52.502]  It used to be the case, I remember when Donald Trump said about no-go zones and the whole world went mad and said he's making it up and he's lying and he's evil.
[02:22:53.162 --> 02:22:55.844]  The fact of the matter is, there are fewer
[02:22:57.189 --> 02:22:57.929]  Safe zones.
[02:22:58.189 --> 02:23:07.411]  There are far more no-go zones, particularly on the mainland of the UK, so England, than there are where you find indigenous Brits that can walk freely.
[02:23:07.531 --> 02:23:16.353]  And like you say, it doesn't matter whether it's a white Christian or a black rapper, you have to respect the fact that you are in a Sharia-controlled zone.
[02:23:16.413 --> 02:23:21.534]  And that means, you know, they're carrying out Sharia patrols on the streets of our country.
[02:23:22.074 --> 02:23:22.774]  And why not?
[02:23:22.934 --> 02:23:24.855]  You know, the state are allowing them to.
[02:23:25.195 --> 02:23:29.276]  This is far bigger than just a few Muslims getting carried away.
[02:23:29.296 --> 02:23:34.798]  This has been orchestrated and aided and abetted by the state.
[02:23:34.818 --> 02:23:42.380]  So what do you do when you've got a government that wants to silence those who are trying to tell the truth and expose the truth?
[02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:46.081]  My biggest crime was exposing
[02:23:46.901 --> 02:23:56.589]  Everything that you just watched there, which was the fact that you're attacked for being Christian, the fact that there are no-go zones, that's Berry Park in Luton, which is Tommy Robinson's hometown.
[02:23:56.649 --> 02:23:59.471]  We're going to play the audio of the next segment, but it's just incredible.
[02:24:00.091 --> 02:24:05.015]  Trying to walk down the street with a cross, they're playing Call to Prayer, there's Islamic stuff everywhere.
[02:24:05.035 --> 02:24:08.958]  The sight of a cross, it's like vampires going crazy when they see it.
[02:24:09.790 --> 02:24:10.671]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:24:10.691 --> 02:24:14.513]  I mean, it's like being faced with Satan himself.
[02:24:14.873 --> 02:24:17.475]  You can see the reaction of these people.
[02:24:17.495 --> 02:24:22.659]  And it's all there in the scriptures, you know, that I've studied the Quran because I think you need to know your enemy.
[02:24:22.939 --> 02:24:29.583]  And it quite clearly states that the most offensive name to Allah on the Day of Judgment will be the one who calls himself the King of Kings.
[02:24:29.863 --> 02:24:39.490]  If you are for Christ and you come up against these people, you will see a level of barbarism and evil that, I have to say, no longer shocks me.
[02:24:39.890 --> 02:24:41.131]  What triggered you to get involved?
[02:24:41.151 --> 02:24:41.632]  Tell us about yourself.
[02:24:50.321 --> 02:24:53.542]  Well, I studied and practiced law for years, right?
[02:24:53.842 --> 02:24:56.402]  And I did so in London.
[02:24:56.462 --> 02:24:59.203]  So whilst doing so, the 7-7 bombings happened.
[02:24:59.583 --> 02:25:06.184]  And I remember everybody in London would drive like three car lengths behind a bus just in case it blew up after that attack.
[02:25:06.705 --> 02:25:09.325]  And so I got to thinking, well, what's motivating these people?
[02:25:09.345 --> 02:25:10.165]  We'd already had 9-11.
[02:25:10.425 --> 02:25:11.846]  I was a child when that happened.
[02:25:12.966 --> 02:25:17.647]  But, you know, I like to look into people's motives for these kind of heinous acts.
[02:25:18.271 --> 02:25:29.577]  And so then I went from, I had my own business after I left law and I went from just running a successful business to shutting the whole thing down and completely dedicating my life.
[02:25:30.242 --> 02:25:46.634]  to political activism, because I tell you what the key trigger moment for me was, coming home, turning the TV on and seeing Lee Rigby's killer with an axe, a meat cleaver in his hand, after he just decapitated one of our Queen's soldiers on the streets of our capital.
[02:25:47.014 --> 02:25:57.502]  For me, anyone who then didn't go out and buy a Quran or read it online for free, after he said he was doing what Allah told him to do, I'm sorry, but ignorance isn't bliss.
[02:25:59.423 --> 02:26:00.864]  And now it's only gotten worse.
[02:26:01.104 --> 02:26:02.525]  Mild criticism of Islam.
[02:26:02.565 --> 02:26:03.386]  You get arrested.
[02:26:03.486 --> 02:26:05.167]  Speakers cornered there for hundreds of years.
[02:26:05.607 --> 02:26:07.429]  Any speech is allowed but criticism of Islam.
[02:26:07.789 --> 02:26:08.569]  And I've seen the videos.
[02:26:08.609 --> 02:26:16.315]  The Islamic preachers have TV shows on broadcast TV saying, kill, we're going to overthrow England, we're going to take their women, we're going to murder the police.
[02:26:16.755 --> 02:26:17.555]  That's allowed.
[02:26:18.216 --> 02:26:21.638]  It's just, why is the British government so in love with Islam?
[02:26:23.379 --> 02:26:24.160]  I really don't know.
[02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:26.502]  I mean, I can't answer that.
[02:26:27.668 --> 02:26:29.670]  The appeasement is so overwhelming.
[02:26:29.730 --> 02:26:31.511]  It's a complete two-tier system.
[02:26:32.052 --> 02:26:34.734]  The indigenous Brits are second-class citizens.
[02:26:34.774 --> 02:26:35.975]  We are second-class citizens.
[02:26:36.095 --> 02:26:38.056]  And we know it and they know it.
[02:26:38.136 --> 02:26:40.298]  So they know that they can push the boundaries.
[02:26:40.738 --> 02:26:44.962]  We have a mosque on every corner, in every town, in every city.
[02:26:45.475 --> 02:26:46.715]  We have sharia calls.
[02:26:46.755 --> 02:26:52.297]  We have a parallel legal system in the UK that Muslims can lean on.
[02:26:52.357 --> 02:27:05.962]  So Muslims have their own legal system, which means that women are being violently abused by their husbands and the CPS, the Crown Prosecution Service, are being told by the sharia councils, leave this to us, we will deal with it our way.
[02:27:06.142 --> 02:27:10.784]  Which is basically to penalise the woman after she's been beaten by her husband.
[02:27:11.331 --> 02:27:17.518]  And by the way, I've got to apologize to Glenn Beck here, because Glenn got jealous of me and attacked me and said a lot of lies and things, but whatever.
[02:27:18.019 --> 02:27:28.010]  I would hear Glenn Beck talking about Sharia law, now it was coming, and no-go zones 15 years ago in the caliphate, and I thought, there's no way that's really going on, and it wasn't until about five years later I found out it was true.
[02:27:28.611 --> 02:27:30.673]  And it's just, because it's so crazy.
[02:27:31.494 --> 02:27:38.605]  To hear all this and then to actually see Western governments doing it, but it's because they've committed themselves to evil and an anti-Christian project.
[02:27:38.906 --> 02:27:42.772]  Why do you think the global system, the global corporations, are so against Christianity?
[02:27:45.198 --> 02:27:49.063]  Because I think, well, I think it's been a well-orchestrated plan.
[02:27:49.083 --> 02:27:58.895]  You know, I would actually say that I think initially there were certain plans that were in place and they were run by institutions that now have pretty much folded.
[02:27:58.935 --> 02:28:01.438]  And what we're left with now is a dangerous elite.
[02:28:01.858 --> 02:28:02.678]  We're good to go.
[02:28:19.767 --> 02:28:22.108]  I mean, we see this in the States as well.
[02:28:22.168 --> 02:28:26.690]  I've seen some of the lunacy that goes on over across the pond that you guys are having to listen to.
[02:28:26.710 --> 02:28:28.571]  You know, it's all about reparations.
[02:28:28.631 --> 02:28:31.712]  It's all about, you know, divide and rule.
[02:28:31.852 --> 02:28:35.394]  And that's the government's ultimate plan, and they're succeeding very well.
[02:28:35.454 --> 02:28:36.954]  They formed these ghettos.
[02:28:37.635 --> 02:28:41.716]  They are aiding and abetting the whole situation on the mainland.
[02:28:42.197 --> 02:28:47.039]  And it's ultimately to destroy the family, destroy Christianity, and
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:49.742]  I mean, it's only going to lead to civil unrest.
[02:28:49.763 --> 02:28:50.704]  I hate to say it.
[02:28:50.744 --> 02:28:51.926]  That's what I was going to ask next.
[02:28:52.026 --> 02:28:53.108]  What does it lead to?
[02:28:53.609 --> 02:28:56.253]  With our guest, Jayden Franson, jaydenfranson.online.
[02:28:56.594 --> 02:28:58.497]  I'm Alex Jones with newswars.com.
[02:28:59.038 --> 02:28:59.819]  Please spread that link.
[02:28:59.839 --> 02:29:00.580]  We'll be right back soon.
[02:29:04.677 --> 02:29:06.600]  I've known Alex for, like, more than 20 years.
[02:29:06.760 --> 02:29:07.561]  I've hung out with that guy.
[02:29:07.581 --> 02:29:09.243]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[02:29:09.344 --> 02:29:11.126]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[02:29:11.206 --> 02:29:13.009]  He was right about all this Jeffrey Epstein s***.
[02:29:13.349 --> 02:29:14.891]  That is a f***ing fact.
[02:29:15.051 --> 02:29:17.475]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:29:17.695 --> 02:29:20.579]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[02:29:20.779 --> 02:29:23.681]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[02:29:24.001 --> 02:29:27.022]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist.
[02:29:27.102 --> 02:29:30.064]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:30.264 --> 02:29:35.327]  Alex Jones supported President Trump but also peddled and promoted sick conspiracy theories.
[02:29:35.487 --> 02:29:40.450]  It's really hard for me to understand how anyone can be so sick in the head.
[02:29:40.610 --> 02:29:42.751]  Alex Jones, my God, Mika, and just...
[02:29:43.271 --> 02:29:43.471]  Yeah.
[02:29:43.631 --> 02:29:45.793]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:45.993 --> 02:29:48.034]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:48.114 --> 02:29:49.876]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:50.116 --> 02:29:53.918]  Alex Jones has been behind several right-wing conspiracy theories.
[02:29:53.998 --> 02:29:56.160]  Right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:59.162]  Radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[02:29:59.462 --> 02:30:03.345]  The captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership.
[02:30:04.170 --> 02:30:10.916]  Alex Jones espouses a litany of conspiracy theories, although he thinks that term belittles his reporting.
[02:30:11.136 --> 02:30:12.317]  The government's poisoning the water?
[02:30:12.738 --> 02:30:13.338]  Absolutely.
[02:30:13.358 --> 02:30:18.262]  I have all these other government documents where the government proposes and government think tanks propose.
[02:30:18.963 --> 02:30:22.266]  It's poisoning the water to dumb down the population, make them more easily manageable.
[02:30:22.706 --> 02:30:25.107]  Oh dear, the fluoride didn't work on this one.
[02:30:25.327 --> 02:30:27.228]  He's fighting back against my takeover.
[02:30:27.568 --> 02:30:29.509]  Hurry, chemtrail him immediately!
[02:30:29.689 --> 02:30:32.750]  I've noticed what they attack me with on mainstream news.
[02:30:32.910 --> 02:30:35.671]  Jones claims your cell phones are killing you.
[02:30:35.831 --> 02:30:40.533]  Jones claims there's chemicals in the water that are lowering your fertility and confusing your sexuality.
[02:30:40.733 --> 02:30:42.674]  Jones says there's black helicopters.
[02:30:42.874 --> 02:30:44.514]  Jones says there's a world government.
[02:30:44.594 --> 02:30:46.535]  Jones says the EU is unelected.
[02:30:46.755 --> 02:30:47.055]  It is.
[02:30:47.075 --> 02:30:47.956]  On and on and on.
[02:30:48.516 --> 02:30:51.117]  And everything we're saying is out in the open.
[02:30:51.357 --> 02:30:56.600]  Kelly Prime's son, Kyle, was just 10 years old when he was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2016.
[02:30:58.362 --> 02:31:03.705]  Five months later, Kyle's friend and classmate, Mason Faruli, developed brain cancer.
[02:31:03.825 --> 02:31:07.107]  Two more kids at the school were diagnosed this year.
[02:31:07.547 --> 02:31:19.075]  The moms believe the recent increase in cancer cases could be caused by radiation from radiofrequency, or RF waves, coming from this cell tower located on the elementary school campus.
[02:31:19.335 --> 02:31:34.870]  So think about how the LA Times and even Wired Magazine will admit there are thousands of studies that prove that wireless radiation, as it's intensified in its strength the last 30 years, and how many places it's emanating from, and especially the microwave millimeter waves.
[02:31:35.150 --> 02:31:35.671]  Cell phones!
[02:31:35.971 --> 02:31:39.254]  ...operate as microwave transmitters and receivers, transceivers.
[02:31:39.414 --> 02:31:40.495]  Now, what's a microwave do?
[02:31:40.515 --> 02:31:42.557]  It vibrates water, vibrates molecules.
[02:31:42.757 --> 02:31:47.661]  And 5G is an even more powerful form of microwave that even rattles it faster.
[02:31:47.681 --> 02:31:52.805]  That's what causes the heat, the friction of the molecules, and burns oxygen and carbon dioxide.
[02:31:52.865 --> 02:31:53.506]  You heard me right.
[02:31:54.086 --> 02:31:56.288]  5G burns the atmosphere.
[02:31:56.808 --> 02:32:02.593]  Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution in Florida in 2008 as part of a controversial deal.
[02:32:03.133 --> 02:32:16.203]  In a civil case against the government about that deal, one accuser says she took part in an orgy on Epstein's private island in 2002 with approximately eight other young girls who appeared to be under the age of 18.
[02:32:16.904 --> 02:32:18.265]  What may have happened here?
[02:32:18.505 --> 02:32:21.428]  Just because some people want to restrict views doesn't mean they have a right to do it.
[02:32:22.148 --> 02:32:28.390]  And see, once that happens, now you can shut down the details of Bill Clinton's best buddy and the pedophile island that we've been exposing.
[02:32:28.710 --> 02:32:37.893]  Prison guards working when Epstein apparently died by suicide may have falsified reports to make it look like they were checking in on Epstein, when they were in fact not.
[02:32:38.193 --> 02:32:41.234]  I am now more suspicious than ever that this could be a homicide.
[02:32:41.374 --> 02:32:43.315]  People won't listen to me because I got too much data!
[02:32:43.335 --> 02:32:44.535]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[02:32:44.735 --> 02:32:47.136]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[02:32:47.636 --> 02:32:48.276]  Years ago.
[02:32:48.657 --> 02:32:55.979]  He was saying that they take a lot of famous people to this island and they have all these young girls that this guy hooks them up with.
[02:32:56.039 --> 02:32:58.240]  He was talking about this years ago.
[02:32:58.360 --> 02:33:00.001]  Now it is mainstream news.
[02:33:06.663 --> 02:33:09.344]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:24.301 --> 02:33:27.112]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:59.932 --> 02:34:01.112]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:34:01.132 --> 02:34:02.092]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:34:02.112 --> 02:34:03.513]  We're broadcasting worldwide.
[02:34:03.973 --> 02:34:07.794]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com, again, are the sites.
[02:34:08.134 --> 02:34:18.296]  We're talking to Jada Franson, who has been a political prisoner, an activist just exposing the fact that 1,400 years ago, Islam started right in the middle of what's Saudi Arabia today.
[02:34:19.136 --> 02:34:29.518]  Within 100 years, it had already pushed out its borders thousands of miles in every direction, and it took 400 years of Europe almost being taken over before they fought back.
[02:34:30.882 --> 02:34:36.404]  And it took him 500 years to even retake Spain.
[02:34:36.424 --> 02:34:38.165]  500 years.
[02:34:38.525 --> 02:34:39.586]  Millions dead.
[02:34:40.426 --> 02:34:43.207]  Millions over the years.
[02:34:43.227 --> 02:34:47.069]  140 plus million Hindus killed by Muslims.
[02:34:48.089 --> 02:34:50.710]  India used to be almost triple the size it is.
[02:34:51.371 --> 02:34:52.491]  Went all the way to Iran.
[02:34:53.231 --> 02:34:55.512]  Was Pakistan, was Kashmir, was part of China.
[02:34:56.173 --> 02:34:56.933]  Not anymore.
[02:34:59.892 --> 02:35:05.637]  Because they push, they expand, and they believe they have a right to rule the world.
[02:35:07.639 --> 02:35:13.324]  And the system is coming in and pushing for a total takeover.
[02:35:14.805 --> 02:35:16.727]  That's what's happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:17.207 --> 02:35:18.628]  We're gonna go back to our guests here in a moment.
[02:35:19.929 --> 02:35:23.693]  We have a new product line in that I'm extremely excited about.
[02:35:23.813 --> 02:35:24.854]  Everybody knows that
[02:35:26.966 --> 02:35:30.687]  Super Silver is the strongest over-the-counter, FDA approved for over-the-counter sale.
[02:35:31.447 --> 02:35:32.307]  Silver there is.
[02:35:32.327 --> 02:35:34.027]  It's used in medical clinics.
[02:35:34.088 --> 02:35:34.988]  It's used in hospitals.
[02:35:35.648 --> 02:35:36.368]  It's for wounds.
[02:35:36.428 --> 02:35:39.269]  A little pea-sized amount of it is like a shield on your skin.
[02:35:39.729 --> 02:35:40.329]  It's amazing.
[02:35:40.829 --> 02:35:45.990]  But because of all the approval and all the things that happen, it's $40 in stores.
[02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:49.471]  We sell it for $29.95 because there's a bunch of costs in getting it approved and all the rest of it.
[02:35:52.031 --> 02:35:55.052]  But I said, everybody says we should put out a high-quality skin cream.
[02:35:56.432 --> 02:35:56.792]  I don't know.
[02:36:19.608 --> 02:36:22.849]  Total natural and also natural, but with grapefruit.
[02:36:23.549 --> 02:36:26.410]  And it's got a lot of incredible things that we have it in the big tubes.
[02:36:27.870 --> 02:36:30.811]  And we also have it in the small tubes.
[02:36:32.771 --> 02:36:32.911]  And.
[02:36:34.612 --> 02:36:39.493]  It's $7 and $14, depending on the tube size.
[02:36:40.653 --> 02:36:44.814]  And this is something that's just incredible view over all the different ingredients that are in it.
[02:36:46.554 --> 02:36:48.815]  It's got coconut oil, vitamin E,
[02:36:51.061 --> 02:36:55.613]  It's got the silver salt patented technology.
[02:36:56.395 --> 02:36:57.799]  It's got the hyaluronic acid.
[02:36:59.335 --> 02:37:17.060]  Independent studies have proven that silver sole technology in super silver skin cream at just 20 ppm silver is up to 10 times more effective than similar products containing up to 3,000 ppm silver because of the way that it's silver sole, the way it's nano, the way it's isolated, the way it's the best stuff out there.
[02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:19.620]  So be sure and get yours today.
[02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:21.621]  Experience it for your face, your hands, your body.
[02:37:23.181 --> 02:37:26.082]  No reviews yet, but you read the reviews for super silver.
[02:37:28.530 --> 02:37:30.832]  Let's go ahead now and go back to Jada Franzen.
[02:37:30.852 --> 02:37:32.373]  You've got the floor.
[02:37:32.473 --> 02:37:35.275]  You've got some of the clips they've got.
[02:37:35.355 --> 02:37:36.256]  You can call for those clips.
[02:37:48.325 --> 02:37:58.094]  Uh, radio listeners have heard the audio, but we've also planked videos over you of just you being attacked for having a cross and walking through the Islamic areas because this isn't England anymore.
[02:37:58.415 --> 02:37:59.716]  They plant the flag.
[02:38:00.056 --> 02:38:01.037]  They know their power.
[02:38:01.077 --> 02:38:04.060]  They're unified and they almost have taken the planet over.
[02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:06.762]  So, uh, and they know they've got the British government.
[02:38:06.803 --> 02:38:09.225]  So there's a real, like you said, a real arrogance here.
[02:38:10.970 --> 02:38:12.210]  Yeah, and do you know what?
[02:38:13.391 --> 02:38:15.932]  The whole crux of the matter is it's not even them that's the danger.
[02:38:15.952 --> 02:38:19.052]  It's not them that's the most dangerous component in the whole mixture.
[02:38:19.092 --> 02:38:19.713]  It's the state.
[02:38:19.773 --> 02:38:20.393]  It's the government.
[02:38:20.473 --> 02:38:26.615]  Because what we have, you know, if it weren't for the government bringing these people in, they wouldn't be taking these liberties.
[02:38:26.655 --> 02:38:27.655]  It's as simple as that.
[02:38:27.995 --> 02:38:33.057]  If you don't invite all of these people into your home, then they don't come in and put your slippers on and get in your bed.
[02:38:33.337 --> 02:38:36.758]  This is the British government's fault through and through and through.
[02:38:37.478 --> 02:38:45.202]  Now what we're looking at is anybody who has dared to raise their head over the parapet and say, hold on a minute, this is not right.
[02:38:45.282 --> 02:38:50.505]  A million children in England have been groomed and raped by Muslim men, that's not normal.
[02:38:51.185 --> 02:38:53.767]  Sharia courts with a parallel legal system, not normal.
[02:38:53.847 --> 02:38:58.649]  Mosques on every corner preaching about beheading the disbelievers, that's not normal.
[02:38:58.989 --> 02:39:05.453]  So there's a few of us in England that have dared to raise our heads up and say,
[02:39:06.363 --> 02:39:07.503]  We're going to speak out about this.
[02:39:08.044 --> 02:39:13.145]  Myself being one and Tommy Robinson being another and he's currently serving time in jail.
[02:39:13.265 --> 02:39:15.926]  I'm facing another two years on the 2nd of September.
[02:39:16.206 --> 02:39:19.667]  We've been removed from every social media platform.
[02:39:19.967 --> 02:39:28.470]  Mark Zuckerberg put a statement out in April stating that I'm banned for life from Facebook after I lost 3 million followers.
[02:39:28.830 --> 02:39:32.171]  I'm banned for life under his dangerous individuals policy.
[02:39:32.831 --> 02:39:35.093]  And these people can make these statements.
[02:39:35.133 --> 02:39:36.194]  They're not held accountable.
[02:39:36.334 --> 02:39:40.779]  I've had Theresa May in the Commons calling me a bigot, spreading lies.
[02:39:41.179 --> 02:39:42.260]  They can say what they like.
[02:39:43.021 --> 02:39:44.342]  There's no one to answer to.
[02:39:44.362 --> 02:39:48.426]  It is a police state over here.
[02:39:48.506 --> 02:39:49.807]  That's it.
[02:39:50.728 --> 02:39:54.171]  We've got to accept that or we need a revolution.
[02:39:54.311 --> 02:39:58.635]  And I just don't know what more it will take for people to do something.
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:09.598]  I want to play the video now and have you describe it first, where you've been found guilty of hate speech in Northern Ireland and why you're there now.
[02:40:09.918 --> 02:40:10.881]  Describe what's happened there.
[02:40:12.401 --> 02:40:16.122]  So I came to Northern Ireland to give a speech, an anti-terror rally, right?
[02:40:16.462 --> 02:40:18.883]  So you'd think that that would be pretty safe.
[02:40:19.183 --> 02:40:19.623]  But no.
[02:40:19.983 --> 02:40:23.244]  Because I basically quoted the Quran.
[02:40:23.624 --> 02:40:28.186]  I quoted the Quran in that it says that Muslims are obliged to kill non-Muslims.
[02:40:28.286 --> 02:40:31.487]  It's not an option, it's mandatory, it's obligatory.
[02:40:31.547 --> 02:40:34.027]  Jihad is the most talked about concept in the Quran.
[02:40:34.528 --> 02:40:36.628]  And I stated what the Quran says.
[02:40:36.648 --> 02:40:38.829]  I was arrested in England
[02:40:40.369 --> 02:40:46.613]  I was driven to Liverpool, taken from London, taken on a ferry overnight to Belfast where they arrested me.
[02:40:47.053 --> 02:40:52.917]  The charge sheet said that I gave a speech that was anti-Islamic in nature.
[02:40:54.182 --> 02:40:59.224]  And I've just been convicted on approximately 10 counts of hate speech.
[02:40:59.805 --> 02:41:03.086]  Now, I'm sorry, but for me, that's blasphemy law.
[02:41:03.126 --> 02:41:06.068]  I don't know whether I'm absolutely losing my mind here.
[02:41:06.628 --> 02:41:13.131]  But if I gave a speech that was anti-Islamic in nature in Pakistan, maybe I could expect to be arrested.
[02:41:13.491 --> 02:41:15.192]  This is the United Kingdom.
[02:41:15.992 --> 02:41:19.814]  And Northern Ireland really is the last stronghold of Britain.
[02:41:19.894 --> 02:41:23.776]  So if they're doing that here, the UK is gone.
[02:41:26.394 --> 02:41:29.896]  You know, I'm sitting here in late 2019.
[02:41:29.936 --> 02:41:31.097]  I look at that BBC headline.
[02:41:31.117 --> 02:41:32.117]  Can we put that back up, please?
[02:41:32.877 --> 02:41:35.459]  And this is the so-called left, the liberals, the West.
[02:41:37.014 --> 02:41:40.235]  Jada Franzen sentenced over Belfast Islam speech.
[02:41:40.855 --> 02:41:47.958]  So it's Tommy Robinson for exposing a pedophile ring that was convicted and just asking him questions as they walked in nicely.
[02:41:48.618 --> 02:41:54.360]  And then it's you for giving a speech about how under Islam they call for jihad and a takeover.
[02:41:54.380 --> 02:42:01.442]  You know, it was Obama years ago that said, oh, none of these al-Qaeda or ISIS attacks are Islam, don't say it's Islam, so the media wouldn't say it's Islam.
[02:42:01.462 --> 02:42:02.723]  So let's put that back up full screen.
[02:42:03.968 --> 02:42:05.089]  I want this to sink in, folks.
[02:42:05.629 --> 02:42:08.271]  Jada Franzen's sentence over Belfast's Islam speech.
[02:42:08.291 --> 02:42:10.033]  In fact, print that for me, guys.
[02:42:10.773 --> 02:42:11.654]  And think about that.
[02:42:11.734 --> 02:42:28.506]  In the supposed place, the birthplace of the Magna Carta, a woman, a legal scholar, a political activist, she goes and gives a speech about the danger of expansionist Islam, how it takes over your government, how it takes your speech, and how then it promotes terrorism and no-go zones and Sharia law.
[02:42:28.526 --> 02:42:32.810]  And for telling the truth, she's arrested, even if it was a lie, under free speech.
[02:42:33.666 --> 02:42:34.346]  She has that right.
[02:42:34.366 --> 02:42:37.428]  So when we come back, we're going to play that clip.
[02:42:38.808 --> 02:42:39.849]  It's just incredible.
[02:42:39.869 --> 02:42:43.410]  And then Tommy Robinson asked for asylum here from Trump.
[02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:48.172]  And, you know, we weren't able to get that through to President Trump, and he didn't respond.
[02:42:49.112 --> 02:42:50.853]  And it's just so scary, folks.
[02:42:51.293 --> 02:42:52.234]  Is there anywhere to run?
[02:42:52.254 --> 02:42:55.055]  I mean, even if you want to run, there's nowhere to run.
[02:42:56.055 --> 02:42:58.456]  There's 1.8 billion Islamists.
[02:42:59.016 --> 02:42:59.897]  They're taking over.
[02:42:59.917 --> 02:43:00.957]  They're murdering.
[02:43:00.977 --> 02:43:01.477]  They're killing.
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:14.603]  I traveled from California to Texas, and it's like a three-day drive, especially if you're not... I had a trailer behind me, so I can't go really fast.
[02:43:14.763 --> 02:43:18.664]  So I'm driving, and I love God's country, and it's beautiful.
[02:43:18.744 --> 02:43:20.484]  But being humans, we get tired.
[02:43:20.764 --> 02:43:25.066]  And even just after four hours of driving, and I'm starting to get tired, and I remembered.
[02:43:25.086 --> 02:43:27.306]  I said, oh, I have a pack of Turbo Force.
[02:43:27.426 --> 02:43:33.488]  So I reached into my console in my vehicle, and I took out the Turbo Force, and I stopped at a gas station.
[02:43:34.625 --> 02:43:36.006]  And I got me some orange juice.
[02:43:36.867 --> 02:43:38.068]  It wasn't quite this big.
[02:43:38.848 --> 02:43:41.230]  The typical size is a little bit smaller.
[02:43:41.250 --> 02:43:48.595]  And I'll put like half the packet of the Turboforce in it because the stuff is so great and so wonderful, it gets you going.
[02:43:49.075 --> 02:43:50.276]  But there's quite a bit in this one.
[02:43:50.296 --> 02:43:52.558]  So I'm going to put the whole thing in this one.
[02:43:53.538 --> 02:44:01.444]  And when I was driving from California to Texas, I took the Turboforce and I put it in orange juice.
[02:44:02.425 --> 02:44:03.726]  And I took it and I shook it up.
[02:44:05.612 --> 02:44:10.756]  Get in there real good.
[02:44:10.776 --> 02:44:13.118]  And you know what's amazing?
[02:44:13.178 --> 02:44:15.460]  It actually enheightens the taste.
[02:44:15.480 --> 02:44:17.161]  I mean, I really like it.
[02:44:17.181 --> 02:44:23.206]  I mean, I'm a big fan of orange juice already, but... Yeah.
[02:44:24.427 --> 02:44:26.528]  I mean, it's really good.
[02:44:26.708 --> 02:44:29.010]  Let me see.
[02:44:30.591 --> 02:44:30.832]  Mmm.
[02:44:31.772 --> 02:44:32.052]  Mmm.
[02:44:32.153 --> 02:44:32.413]  Wow.
[02:44:34.033 --> 02:44:36.515]  It's like energy immediately.
[02:44:36.715 --> 02:44:40.058]  The experience with Turboforce in orange juice is so different.
[02:44:40.078 --> 02:44:44.181]  A lot of people just take it and put it in water and they never thought about putting it in orange juice.
[02:44:44.282 --> 02:44:45.102]  It's completely different.
[02:44:45.242 --> 02:44:47.965]  So the orange juice, it like intensifies the taste.
[02:44:48.025 --> 02:44:48.505]  But you know what?
[02:44:48.665 --> 02:44:51.087]  I'm not talking about it just so people will buy it.
[02:44:51.187 --> 02:44:53.309]  I'm talking about it because it's my personal experience.
[02:44:53.449 --> 02:44:55.010]  It's like it brightens the orange juice up.
[02:44:55.090 --> 02:44:56.131]  I can't really explain it.
[02:44:56.171 --> 02:44:58.753]  You have to buy it and try it yourself to understand.
[02:44:58.773 --> 02:44:59.374]  If you have a package
[02:44:59.394 --> 02:44:59.654]  I don't know.
[02:45:16.167 --> 02:45:16.687]  Pass out.
[02:45:16.847 --> 02:45:21.930]  And you know, I've had so many people come up to me and said, Will, I tried it with the orange juice and I love it.
[02:45:22.110 --> 02:45:25.311]  And with the TurboForce, I mean, it's like the missing ingredient.
[02:45:25.412 --> 02:45:30.694]  I mean, seriously, TurboForce is the missing ingredient in the orange juice and I'm addicted to it.
[02:45:31.034 --> 02:45:34.236]  The TurboForce at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:45:35.370 --> 02:45:37.371]  Most of the time, they keep it on sale.
[02:45:37.751 --> 02:45:40.373]  And I'm like, how are they able to do that?
[02:45:40.433 --> 02:45:42.294]  They keep it on sale for so long.
[02:45:42.414 --> 02:45:52.780]  And I think, now I've never been told this, but I think the main reason why they keep it on sale and they keep the price so low is that so people will try it and you will be amazed.
[02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:54.261]  So get the Turbo Force today.
[02:45:54.341 --> 02:45:55.442]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:02.611 --> 02:46:04.032]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[02:46:04.312 --> 02:46:06.074]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[02:46:06.434 --> 02:46:07.795]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[02:46:08.175 --> 02:46:09.076]  But I'll be honest with you.
[02:46:09.917 --> 02:46:14.340]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[02:46:15.281 --> 02:46:16.942]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[02:46:17.142 --> 02:46:17.763]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[02:46:18.443 --> 02:46:19.184]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:46:20.191 --> 02:46:21.451]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[02:46:21.671 --> 02:46:24.092]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[02:46:24.372 --> 02:46:25.133]  I don't want them to win.
[02:46:25.513 --> 02:46:27.533]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[02:46:28.434 --> 02:46:31.214]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[02:46:31.554 --> 02:46:34.315]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[02:46:34.715 --> 02:46:38.457]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[02:46:38.497 --> 02:46:39.717]  These will change your life.
[02:46:40.077 --> 02:46:41.458]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[02:46:41.478 --> 02:46:43.179]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[02:46:43.479 --> 02:46:44.140]  Check it all out.
[02:46:44.160 --> 02:46:45.781]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[02:46:46.121 --> 02:46:47.722]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:47.922 --> 02:46:49.103]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[02:46:49.403 --> 02:46:50.544]  You get great products at the same time.
[02:46:50.884 --> 02:46:53.005]  InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site.
[02:46:53.346 --> 02:46:55.287]  InfoWarsLife.com is the supplements.
[02:46:55.527 --> 02:46:58.609]  Take action now and fund the Info War for your own future.
[02:47:06.138 --> 02:47:20.782]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:23.183 --> 02:47:29.745]  Well, you've got your diamonds, and you've got your pretty clothes.
[02:47:30.776 --> 02:47:34.083]  And the chauffeur drives your car.
[02:47:34.865 --> 02:47:40.358]  You let everybody know, but don't play.
[02:47:44.938 --> 02:47:51.604]  All these deceived people bringing in these systems are losing their souls, their independence.
[02:47:52.284 --> 02:47:55.867]  I used to always read that, and I saw it in life that it was good and evil, but I didn't get it.
[02:47:56.448 --> 02:47:58.770]  People that turn over to evil lose their independence.
[02:47:58.810 --> 02:47:59.930]  They lose their discernment.
[02:48:00.491 --> 02:48:01.952]  They lose their souls.
[02:48:02.833 --> 02:48:04.895]  They join with Solaron.
[02:48:06.052 --> 02:48:07.493]  They join with the devil.
[02:48:08.353 --> 02:48:09.894]  They turn their will over to it.
[02:48:09.914 --> 02:48:11.014]  They become slaves of it.
[02:48:11.454 --> 02:48:12.435]  They have power.
[02:48:14.375 --> 02:48:15.836]  But the power is not theirs.
[02:48:15.896 --> 02:48:18.117]  You know, the greatest victim of Islam is Islam.
[02:48:19.457 --> 02:48:24.980]  If you look at a map of Islam, it controls more than half the world.
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.040]  1.8 billion Muslims right now.
[02:48:28.501 --> 02:48:30.482]  And powerful corporations allied with them.
[02:48:32.322 --> 02:48:33.403]  Moving against the planet.
[02:48:34.591 --> 02:48:38.092]  And yeah, a lot of Muslims just want to have a life and are nice people, but they're not the leadership.
[02:48:38.812 --> 02:48:42.314]  And it's Muslims that are more bullied and controlled than, I say, any other group.
[02:48:44.234 --> 02:48:45.675]  Jada Franzen, political president.
[02:48:45.695 --> 02:48:46.755]  We're going to play a clip here in a moment.
[02:48:46.775 --> 02:48:48.896]  You've been convicted again of thought crime.
[02:48:49.396 --> 02:48:56.538]  If you lose your appeal in the... Were you convicted in Northern Ireland or in Ireland general?
[02:48:57.278 --> 02:48:58.719]  How much prison time are you facing?
[02:49:20.814 --> 02:49:24.395]  So, are they expecting a backlash to this or anything?
[02:49:24.715 --> 02:49:27.636]  With the BBC licking its lips that you're convicted of giving a speech?
[02:49:27.656 --> 02:49:31.617]  I mean, don't they know that the optics of this, the West supposedly honoured free speech?
[02:49:33.385 --> 02:49:35.366]  Oh look, they absolutely love it.
[02:49:35.426 --> 02:49:40.209]  I mean, the BBC is a public funded corporation.
[02:49:40.269 --> 02:49:44.492]  We pay taxpayers, I don't know, taxpayers pay for it right through a licence fee.
[02:49:44.852 --> 02:49:46.893]  I've told people for years, boycott that licence.
[02:49:47.693 --> 02:49:52.416]  They peddle just the most disgusting lies, the narrative.
[02:49:52.516 --> 02:49:55.238]  And it's not just that, they also peddle a narrative that is
[02:49:56.383 --> 02:50:01.958]  Actively promoting the erosion of Christian and British traditions and heritage.
[02:50:02.159 --> 02:50:03.181]  Anything that is
[02:50:04.178 --> 02:50:05.459]  We're good to go.
[02:50:31.812 --> 02:50:45.856]  I mean, I'll say what they're doing here is still terrible, but it's not nine months in prison like you spent or Tommy has had to go through.
[02:50:45.916 --> 02:50:49.777]  But still, they're arguing, your lawyers argue, it's freedom of expression.
[02:50:50.137 --> 02:50:50.757]  Plus, it's true.
[02:50:51.681 --> 02:50:53.803]  And they literally say to hell with the freedom of expression.
[02:50:54.183 --> 02:51:00.628]  I mean, let me tell you, I know this is all EU-type law, but the people of Ireland, I know they're angry in Scotland and particularly England.
[02:51:01.068 --> 02:51:02.149]  What is the sense of the people?
[02:51:02.189 --> 02:51:09.915]  Because I have friends and family that go to England a lot, I talk to folks over there, and they say people are madder than ever and they're really waking up.
[02:51:09.955 --> 02:51:12.217]  Is that accurate or is that pie in the sky?
[02:51:13.427 --> 02:51:14.287]  Yeah, no, do you know what?
[02:51:14.347 --> 02:51:17.068]  I'm pleased to say that we seem to be getting somewhere.
[02:51:17.168 --> 02:51:22.429]  I spent the last six years of activism just basically raising awareness.
[02:51:22.769 --> 02:51:30.270]  And so through that, through my activities, it did raise awareness to the point where I was retweeted by President Donald Trump.
[02:51:30.610 --> 02:51:33.191]  And that caused mass hysteria over here.
[02:51:33.211 --> 02:51:34.991]  I mean, I'd switch the TV on that morning.
[02:51:35.151 --> 02:51:37.491]  I was on every single news station across the world.
[02:51:37.571 --> 02:51:38.712]  My face was everywhere.
[02:51:38.732 --> 02:51:40.112]  And I was being called
[02:51:40.692 --> 02:51:45.877]  Worse than evil by Sadiq Khan, Theresa May, you know, everybody in the House of Commons.
[02:51:45.937 --> 02:51:50.741]  And all you did was show Muslims around the world destroying Christian churches and their own videos they posted.
[02:51:51.762 --> 02:51:55.705]  And throwing homosexuals off the roof, smashing up statues of the Virgin Mary.
[02:51:55.745 --> 02:51:57.327]  I mean, I didn't create these videos.
[02:51:57.827 --> 02:51:59.028]  They created the videos.
[02:51:59.228 --> 02:51:59.969]  I shared them.
[02:52:00.289 --> 02:52:00.930]  Donald Trump shared them.
[02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:03.932]  And they said you were interfering with 10 Downing Street.
[02:52:04.493 --> 02:52:06.735]  That you were supposed to interfere.
[02:52:06.955 --> 02:52:08.016]  It's our governments, dammit!
[02:52:08.959 --> 02:52:09.259]  I know.
[02:52:09.279 --> 02:52:22.992]  Apparently I caused a breakdown between Number 10 and the White House because when Theresa May told Donald Trump, take the retweets down, he told her, I suggest you pay attention to the terrorism that's happening in your capital and leave my Twitter account be.
[02:52:23.052 --> 02:52:30.118]  I mean, where does the British government get off telling the leader of the free world how to use his own Twitter account?
[02:52:30.419 --> 02:52:32.361]  And then because he wouldn't remove the retweets,
[02:52:33.021 --> 02:52:38.224]  Twitter deleted my account permanently because it was the only way to get them off of his timeline.
[02:52:38.244 --> 02:52:42.027]  I mean, they're not just censoring the likes of myself and you, Alex.
[02:52:42.107 --> 02:52:44.969]  They're censoring the President of the United States.
[02:52:45.869 --> 02:52:46.550]  It's incredible.
[02:52:47.270 --> 02:52:48.511]  Jada, let's expand on this.
[02:52:50.240 --> 02:52:58.873]  Once they got the pedophile rings, which is all over the British news, for Americans this Epstein thing is new, but as you know, for 30 years it's been known that pedophile rings got control.
[02:52:59.354 --> 02:53:01.397]  They use it to blackmail people.
[02:53:01.417 --> 02:53:03.901]  They got control of the Catholic Church with it, to a great extent.
[02:53:06.164 --> 02:53:17.827]  So once they capitulated to that, then this evil group behind it is capitulated to Islam, and they even fly back ISIS and Al Qaeda members and let them come back to England, and then give them free welfare better than war veterans get.
[02:53:17.847 --> 02:53:22.409]  I mean, they are the most coddled, worshipped, protected group, and it just shows.
[02:53:23.687 --> 02:53:27.228]  What is the evil at the center of England that is taking control of it?
[02:53:27.828 --> 02:53:39.050]  I mean, how do you describe this pedophilic, globalist thing that's there that sucked the energy out of England to build the empire at its expense and is now merging with Islam?
[02:53:40.531 --> 02:53:42.851]  I mean, it's just, it's satanic.
[02:53:42.931 --> 02:53:45.872]  There's no other way to rationalize this.
[02:53:45.912 --> 02:53:47.212]  No rational person
[02:53:47.785 --> 02:53:48.626]  We're good to go.
[02:54:08.002 --> 02:54:17.531]  are selling us out and their own children into a future which is going to be bloody unrest and eventually Islamic takeover.
[02:54:18.051 --> 02:54:23.796]  These people are so evil to their core that all they care about is themselves.
[02:54:23.856 --> 02:54:26.318]  All they care about is serving themselves.
[02:54:26.678 --> 02:54:28.440]  And so there's a slippery slope.
[02:54:28.460 --> 02:54:30.422]  You were saying earlier, you know, actually
[02:54:31.082 --> 02:54:35.703]  They lose the power then, because once you turn to evil, all is lost.
[02:54:36.123 --> 02:54:43.125]  And so that's why I make it one of my... I mean, I am inspired and everything I do, I am powered by God.
[02:54:43.185 --> 02:54:45.185]  I'm an extremely faithful person.
[02:54:45.485 --> 02:54:46.845]  Without God, I'd be nowhere.
[02:54:47.245 --> 02:54:51.606]  And so I have to... I lean on my faith at every single turn.
[02:54:51.646 --> 02:54:59.128]  And believe you me, I've needed God throughout these last six years, because the persecution is absolutely rife.
[02:54:59.808 --> 02:55:04.432]  See, once you step away from good and you embrace evil, you're finished.
[02:55:04.472 --> 02:55:05.974]  We have to fight against these people.
[02:55:08.596 --> 02:55:11.158]  Well, you're absolutely right, and we've got a few minutes left.
[02:55:11.358 --> 02:55:14.261]  You've been hard to get on the show, I guess, because they've always got you in prison or whatever.
[02:55:14.661 --> 02:55:15.602]  What are you doing next?
[02:55:15.662 --> 02:55:16.663]  How do people help you?
[02:55:17.023 --> 02:55:18.765]  Who's the real resistance in the UK?
[02:55:18.865 --> 02:55:20.366]  Any other info on Tommy Robinson?
[02:55:21.482 --> 02:55:24.323]  So Tommy's just released another letter to say that he's doing better.
[02:55:24.343 --> 02:55:29.345]  He's getting his mail now and actually this weekend I'm over in Northern Ireland.
[02:55:29.385 --> 02:55:35.628]  We've got a demonstration organised over here for him and there are a couple taking place across the mainland as well.
[02:55:35.648 --> 02:55:37.689]  They'll all be happening at the same time on Saturday.
[02:55:37.729 --> 02:55:42.851]  So if anyone who's watching in Northern Ireland, get yourselves over to Belfast and we'll see you there.
[02:55:43.332 --> 02:55:45.493]  It's great to hear that he's doing better.
[02:55:45.513 --> 02:55:48.074]  In terms of the resistance, I
[02:55:48.914 --> 02:56:00.126]  I would say that at the moment it's like this situation with the social media removal and censorship and coal has really separated the men from the boys and I'm talking about myself in that.
[02:56:00.146 --> 02:56:00.807]  I'm not a feminist.
[02:56:00.827 --> 02:56:04.951]  I'm not going to start screaming that I've just, you know, misgendered myself.
[02:56:05.031 --> 02:56:07.234]  But look, I think at this time,
[02:56:08.302 --> 02:56:14.204]  The only, the strongest will survive because you asked about how people can help me and how people can support me.
[02:56:14.244 --> 02:56:20.846]  Well, you can stay in touch with me at jadafrance.online, but at the moment I am unable to obtain a payment processor.
[02:56:20.886 --> 02:56:23.667]  I've had absolutely every platform shut me down.
[02:56:24.307 --> 02:56:28.391]  And this was ordered by the state so that it's impossible for me to live.
[02:56:28.892 --> 02:56:32.496]  And so these are the issues that I face, you know, day to day.
[02:56:32.516 --> 02:56:34.317]  I didn't get into this cause for money.
[02:56:34.337 --> 02:56:41.205]  I closed down a very lucrative business to dedicate myself to extremism, being locked up and poverty.
[02:56:41.625 --> 02:56:47.211]  But you know, if you can't live and you can't put food in your mouth and you can't keep a roof over your head,
[02:56:47.751 --> 02:56:49.352]  Then you're absolutely screwed.
[02:56:49.392 --> 02:56:50.213]  Let me explain that.
[02:56:50.733 --> 02:56:53.995]  First they attacked me like 20 years ago saying Jones just wants to make money.
[02:56:54.035 --> 02:56:56.136]  So I said, let me show you I can make money and get big.
[02:56:56.737 --> 02:56:59.319]  Because I realized I had to be a leader, not just somebody on the air.
[02:56:59.339 --> 02:57:00.279]  They want to destroy me already.
[02:57:00.299 --> 02:57:04.742]  And then when they try to take everything away from you, you realize money is the power to tell the truth.
[02:57:04.762 --> 02:57:05.783]  So we don't worship money.
[02:57:06.103 --> 02:57:07.224]  We don't sell out to money.
[02:57:07.544 --> 02:57:11.847]  But we need a bunch of money to stay in the game and fight those that have sold out for it.
[02:57:12.267 --> 02:57:14.068]  First they try to take it away to make us grovel.
[02:57:14.108 --> 02:57:14.668]  Then we don't.
[02:57:14.989 --> 02:57:16.009]  Then they try to fully destroy us.
[02:57:16.049 --> 02:57:16.930]  So absolutely, people should go.
[02:57:17.370 --> 02:57:17.850]  All right.
[02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:18.271]  God bless you.
[02:57:18.391 --> 02:57:19.231]  We want to thank you so much.
[02:57:19.251 --> 02:57:20.552]  We'll be back with our number four.
[02:57:20.572 --> 02:57:21.232]  I'll be hosting part of it.
[02:57:21.272 --> 02:57:22.012]  Stay with us.
[02:57:43.314 --> 02:57:44.815]  We are on the march.
[02:57:45.235 --> 02:57:47.676]  The empire is on the run.
[02:57:48.156 --> 02:57:51.037]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:54.779 --> 02:57:58.801]  When you finance what we're doing, you're not just funding the second American revolution.
[02:58:00.185 --> 02:58:01.746]  You're changing world destiny.
[02:58:02.086 --> 02:58:06.229]  And there's so much fake stuff out there in a million different voices, and I understand that.
[02:58:06.729 --> 02:58:11.872]  But we really are in the zeitgeist, and we try to make it easy to get good products at the same time.
[02:58:11.952 --> 02:58:18.315]  But I can just tell you point blank, you cannot invest in a place better than InfoWars for human liberty and a pro-human future.
[02:58:18.376 --> 02:58:24.119]  We got coffee, we got fish oil, we got turmeric, we got great toothpaste, we've got great things like DNA Force Plus.
[02:58:24.139 --> 02:58:26.620]  But Ultimate Krill Oil has been sold out for four months.
[02:58:26.820 --> 02:58:29.562]  For whatever reason, this became the most popular fish oil we have.
[02:58:29.642 --> 02:58:32.244]  Fish oil, children's fish oil, and ultimate krill oil.
[02:58:32.384 --> 02:58:33.485]  It's totally full of the bottle.
[02:58:33.885 --> 02:58:36.847]  And it is the strongest, purest fish oil, krill oil.
[02:58:36.907 --> 02:58:43.491]  And it cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process to remove mercury.
[02:58:43.692 --> 02:58:49.395]  Any type of krill oil you get that doesn't give you fish burps, which I don't like, but gives you all the great benefits, isn't real.
[02:58:49.435 --> 02:58:51.777]  It's been boiled, it's been ruined, it's been homogenized.
[02:58:51.957 --> 02:58:52.658]  This is not it.
[02:58:52.998 --> 02:58:54.439]  We went to one of the top firms in the
[02:58:54.759 --> 02:58:55.239]  I think?
[02:59:14.608 --> 02:59:16.148]  And by the way, I'm not hyping this, folks.
[02:59:16.348 --> 02:59:19.489]  This is the best krill oil we could find.
[02:59:19.509 --> 02:59:20.309]  This is the best.
[02:59:20.329 --> 02:59:21.690]  I can't even just look at that.
[02:59:21.710 --> 02:59:24.650]  It's supposed to be red, folks, because that's the essence of the krill.
[02:59:24.670 --> 02:59:27.331]  I mean, there's probably like a hundred krill going to each one of these.
[02:59:27.531 --> 02:59:31.012]  And again, I'm not going to call this a drug, because drugs are a ripoff of what God made.
[02:59:31.292 --> 02:59:33.752]  You take two of these before you go to bed at night.
[02:59:33.912 --> 02:59:35.933]  I would do it with your dinner if you don't want to get fish burps.
[02:59:35.953 --> 02:59:37.573]  Because again, I've got the fish oils of old.
[02:59:37.773 --> 02:59:40.415]  This doesn't have the fish flavor, because they boiled the hell out of it.
[02:59:40.475 --> 02:59:41.856]  It isn't there anymore, folks.
[02:59:41.996 --> 02:59:43.277]  You gotta deal with the fish burps.
[02:59:43.317 --> 02:59:44.317]  This stuff's powerful.
[02:59:44.357 --> 02:59:45.118]  Just look at that.
[02:59:45.178 --> 02:59:47.359]  Can a camera pick up just how pretty those are?
[02:59:47.499 --> 02:59:49.020]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:49.120 --> 02:59:57.486]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[03:00:03.592 --> 03:00:07.433]  This is Greg Reese reporting from mainland China for InfoWars.com.
[03:00:08.214 --> 03:00:11.855]  Behind me here is the start of the HKZM Bridge.
[03:00:12.475 --> 03:00:24.059]  Opened less than one year ago, the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge is 34 miles long, consisting of three cable-stayed bridges, an undersea tunnel, and four artificial islands.
[03:00:24.719 --> 03:00:27.240]  It is the longest open-sea fixed link on Earth.
[03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:30.141]  The bridge links the mainland to Hong Kong.
[03:00:30.721 --> 03:00:34.164]  This is the bridge the Chai Kams are going to use to invade Hong Kong.
[03:00:34.825 --> 03:00:44.553]  Reporter Savannah Hernandez is reporting on the upcoming elections that are already fixed, where only one candidate who stands for Beijing rule over Macau is set to win the election.
[03:00:45.433 --> 03:00:49.637]  First comes Macau, second comes Hong Kong, and this is the breach.
[03:00:52.981 --> 03:01:00.148]  After World War II, we saw the rise of communism in the Soviet Union and in the People's Republic of China.
[03:01:01.629 --> 03:01:12.159]  In 1949, the Chinese Communist Revolution, led by Party Chairman Mao Zedong, was responsible for the murder of over 100 million Chinese.
[03:01:14.412 --> 03:01:27.280]  Millions of others fled the mainland into Taiwan and Hong Kong, which as a result, grew into thriving societies as mainland China plunged into darkness.
[03:01:27.921 --> 03:01:35.726]  2019, the 70-year anniversary of the Communist Revolution, and despite its horrors, communism continues to spread.
[03:01:37.586 --> 03:01:46.448]  The People's Republic is a model for globalized governance, and the Communist Chinese are now looking to absorb those who fled 70 years ago.
[03:01:46.468 --> 03:01:58.551]  100,000 troops of the CHICOM's paramilitary PAF are now training on the border of these autonomous cities, preparing for an invasion.
[03:02:02.034 --> 03:02:07.098]  And the people of Hong Kong are united against this tyrannical cancer.
[03:02:10.180 --> 03:02:13.982]  Right behind me is mainland China, separated by this small waterway.
[03:02:14.383 --> 03:02:23.529]  With over 100,000 troops already amassed, set to invade, only a fraction of the people's armed force, the Chi-Coms are preparing for Tiananmen Square 2.0.
[03:02:25.570 --> 03:02:30.194]  Reporting from mainland China, for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[03:02:31.252 --> 03:02:34.874]  You know, in the old days, that video would get 10 million views on YouTube.
[03:02:35.615 --> 03:02:37.456]  It'll get 100,000 on InfoWars.
[03:02:37.936 --> 03:02:40.958]  But we're hitting an audience that's already awake, which is awesome.
[03:02:41.358 --> 03:02:42.099]  You're the home base.
[03:02:42.199 --> 03:02:42.879]  You're funding us.
[03:02:42.939 --> 03:02:43.640]  You're spreading the word.
[03:02:43.700 --> 03:02:44.220]  God bless you.
[03:02:44.921 --> 03:02:47.282]  We want to really expose what's going on.
[03:02:47.882 --> 03:02:52.025]  So please, more important than financial support, go get that video.
[03:02:52.125 --> 03:02:53.306]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[03:02:54.741 --> 03:02:56.263]  And there's like 10 of them now.
[03:02:57.024 --> 03:02:58.685]  Today, there's so many videos they're shooting.
[03:02:59.286 --> 03:03:02.410]  He and Savannah, the camera guy, had to come back to a family function.
[03:03:02.710 --> 03:03:03.591]  He's flying back right now.
[03:03:03.651 --> 03:03:04.792]  Paul Watson just got in.
[03:03:05.513 --> 03:03:07.715]  That's why we went ahead and sent the team early, was to support Watson.
[03:03:07.735 --> 03:03:09.397]  We wouldn't have told you until he got into the country.
[03:03:09.818 --> 03:03:10.759]  He's into Hong Kong now.
[03:03:12.160 --> 03:03:15.342]  Huge demonstration coming up on Sunday.
[03:03:16.083 --> 03:03:17.764]  The Chi-Coms may invade next week.
[03:03:17.784 --> 03:03:18.744]  They've been threatening to.
[03:03:19.064 --> 03:03:21.606]  They've already sent all these motorcycle squads more than 10 times.
[03:03:22.206 --> 03:03:24.568]  So, InfoWars has people live on the ground.
[03:03:24.588 --> 03:03:26.109]  And by the way, I didn't tell the crew to go.
[03:03:26.929 --> 03:03:27.970]  I was like, do you want to go?
[03:03:28.090 --> 03:03:29.511]  And then Savannah's like, I want to go.
[03:03:29.531 --> 03:03:34.454]  And I'm like, well, there's this chivalry thing about sending a woman into a war zone, but you want to go.
[03:03:34.474 --> 03:03:37.636]  You know, because I mean, they're really attacking reporters.
[03:03:37.716 --> 03:03:38.156]  It's dangerous.
[03:03:38.176 --> 03:03:38.876]  She said, I love it.
[03:03:38.896 --> 03:03:39.297]  I want to go.
[03:03:39.817 --> 03:03:41.178]  Then I said, don't go to the mainland.
[03:03:42.449 --> 03:03:44.009]  They go, oh, well, we're in Macau.
[03:03:44.089 --> 03:03:44.710]  It's not China.
[03:03:44.750 --> 03:03:46.890]  I'm like, that does still count.
[03:03:46.930 --> 03:03:48.311]  Get your ass back to Hong Kong.
[03:03:49.071 --> 03:03:53.152]  So, I mean, I was like screaming at him this morning, kind of a smile on my face at the same time.
[03:03:53.172 --> 03:03:55.953]  It's kind of like, this is your mission.
[03:03:56.333 --> 03:03:57.413]  Should you choose to accept it?
[03:03:57.534 --> 03:04:00.835]  That's kind of how it's been here for the 10 years that I've been here.
[03:04:01.275 --> 03:04:02.275]  You know, this is your mission.
[03:04:02.315 --> 03:04:03.135]  You choose to accept it.
[03:04:03.935 --> 03:04:05.396]  And we do and we go and do it.
[03:04:05.816 --> 03:04:10.938]  And it's been quite a quite a ride watching how things change throughout the years.
[03:04:11.258 --> 03:04:11.638]  So it's.
[03:04:13.166 --> 03:04:16.289]  You know, they think it lowers our morale to be the most banned group out there.
[03:04:16.349 --> 03:04:18.931]  I think it made our morale way better.
[03:04:19.011 --> 03:04:24.996]  I mean, I know people that bitched and griped before and, you know, that were great people, but people get it now.
[03:04:25.176 --> 03:04:27.718]  There's not, you know... No, the awakening's happening.
[03:04:27.738 --> 03:04:30.641]  It's happening faster now that the banning's happening to more and more people.
[03:04:30.681 --> 03:04:32.883]  When it was you, it was like, well, it's just Alex Jones.
[03:04:32.903 --> 03:04:34.924]  But now, oh, now there's millions of accounts.
[03:04:35.285 --> 03:04:37.066]  Now millions of people are being affected by this.
[03:04:37.606 --> 03:04:39.088]  And now, people are waking up.
[03:04:39.248 --> 03:04:40.289]  So, told you so.
[03:04:42.205 --> 03:04:43.666]  It's an incredible time to be alive.
[03:04:43.746 --> 03:04:57.272]  Mike Adams is coming up, but you came to me today with new sickening, sickening sex crime stuff with children and the left and the pedophile story time, which is happening from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[03:04:57.692 --> 03:04:59.013]  This is their sick move.
[03:04:59.413 --> 03:05:00.013]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:00.033 --> 03:05:00.473]  Stay with us.
[03:05:03.695 --> 03:05:05.136]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[03:05:05.416 --> 03:05:07.176]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[03:05:07.537 --> 03:05:10.178]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you.
[03:05:11.010 --> 03:05:15.433]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[03:05:16.353 --> 03:05:18.034]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[03:05:18.234 --> 03:05:18.835]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[03:05:19.535 --> 03:05:20.256]  But here's the bottom line.
[03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:22.541]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[03:05:22.761 --> 03:05:25.182]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[03:05:25.462 --> 03:05:26.222]  I don't want them to win.
[03:05:26.602 --> 03:05:28.643]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[03:05:29.543 --> 03:05:32.305]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[03:05:32.645 --> 03:05:35.406]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists enough of their money.
[03:05:35.806 --> 03:05:39.548]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[03:05:39.608 --> 03:05:40.848]  These will change your life.
[03:05:41.168 --> 03:05:42.549]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[03:05:42.589 --> 03:05:44.289]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[03:05:44.590 --> 03:05:45.250]  Check it all out.
[03:05:45.290 --> 03:05:48.831]  Whatever you do, take action and know, be part of the second American revolution.
[03:05:49.011 --> 03:05:50.212]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[03:05:50.492 --> 03:05:51.653]  You get great products at the same time.
[03:05:51.953 --> 03:05:54.114]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[03:05:54.434 --> 03:05:56.375]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[03:05:56.615 --> 03:05:59.757]  Take action now and fund the InfoWar for your own future.
[03:06:12.243 --> 03:06:14.865]  Dr. Nick Begich is taking over.
[03:06:16.903 --> 03:06:25.828]  But Rob Dew, the Infowars News Director, has particularly been exposing the LGBTP movement.
[03:06:26.328 --> 03:06:27.589]  He's got a bunch of reports together.
[03:06:27.609 --> 03:06:30.150]  We've only got 10 minutes to do it, so take over.
[03:06:30.530 --> 03:06:33.312]  Alright, so first this came across my desk this morning.
[03:06:33.392 --> 03:06:39.415]  Surgeon branded Francis Wurst as pedo after raping hundreds of kids while under anesthesia and recording abuse in sick diary.
[03:06:39.455 --> 03:06:40.136]  This is in The Sun.
[03:06:40.856 --> 03:06:48.681]  So a top French surgeon, Joel, some French name, alleged to have attacked girls and boys over three decades, sometimes while they were under anesthesia.
[03:06:48.701 --> 03:06:49.482]  It's vampiric.
[03:06:49.502 --> 03:06:51.123]  That's why it's a vampire cult.
[03:06:51.443 --> 03:06:55.166]  But this, you know, and then they show, they say, oh, Prince Andrew's only getting a foot massage.
[03:06:55.206 --> 03:06:56.807]  He wasn't doing anything with these young girls.
[03:06:57.087 --> 03:06:57.948]  And it's like, yeah, right.
[03:06:57.968 --> 03:06:58.908]  Do you believe any of this?
[03:06:59.009 --> 03:06:59.609]  Any of this crap?
[03:06:59.649 --> 03:07:06.514]  Especially after, you know, the guy who's the demon clown who's raping dead people.
[03:07:07.074 --> 03:07:08.756]  Essentially, in uh... Jimmy Savelle.
[03:07:08.776 --> 03:07:09.717]  Jimmy Savelle, yeah.
[03:07:10.057 --> 03:07:11.018]  And so you believe any of this?
[03:07:11.078 --> 03:07:11.238]  No.
[03:07:11.278 --> 03:07:19.646]  Well now, we've uncovered, with the help, uh, you know, with LifeSite News, first the first drag queen... Well the reason that's important to us, he was the best friend of Prince Charles.
[03:07:19.686 --> 03:07:20.046]  Well yes.
[03:07:20.286 --> 03:07:22.508]  Deliberate kids, but just keep going here, just get the news you got.
[03:07:22.669 --> 03:07:26.912]  So here we got, Houston Drag Queen Storytime shuts down after participant outed his child sex offender.
[03:07:26.933 --> 03:07:27.793]  That was back in March.
[03:07:28.394 --> 03:07:32.778]  Then, bombshell, another drag queen story member exposes pedophile investigation shows in April.
[03:07:32.918 --> 03:07:33.719]  Gee, big surprise.
[03:07:33.779 --> 03:07:34.040]  Okay.
[03:07:34.520 --> 03:07:40.608]  Now we have in Austin, Miss Kitty Litter, someone who Owen has confronted a few times.
[03:07:40.648 --> 03:07:45.254]  Here's Miss Kitty Litter right here, and I have a video of Miss Kitty Litter so you can see what kind of person is reading to your kids.
[03:07:46.356 --> 03:07:48.358]  Busted in 96 for prostitution.
[03:07:49.130 --> 03:07:52.234]  Okay, and we're going to play the kitty leader clip second.
[03:07:52.254 --> 03:07:54.897]  We're going to play your larger four-minute report first.
[03:07:54.957 --> 03:08:00.424]  Right, but here is the Criminal History Convention back in 96, Arrested for Prostitution.
[03:08:00.584 --> 03:08:06.851]  And if you guys pull up that article, you can find a better version of it, but it says here the name is David Richardson.
[03:08:07.912 --> 03:08:18.602]  Well, I mean, the guy that was in Louisiana at the City Council, he goes, I'm a sex worker and I entertain men, but I can turn it off with your kids and I'm going to groom them.
[03:08:18.762 --> 03:08:22.565]  And when he says drag queen story time, he does his eyes like drag queen story time.
[03:08:22.585 --> 03:08:26.628]  And I put that in this compilation video coming up, which will really bring people up to date.
[03:08:26.849 --> 03:08:31.132]  Because the fetish is your children and everybody knows this, but this is how sick it is.
[03:08:31.212 --> 03:08:33.054]  But tell them about the four minute clip we're going to play first.
[03:08:33.274 --> 03:08:48.682]  Yeah, this is basically a collection, basically everything you've asked for, the people saying come to the TV, the kid Desmond is amazing doing the ketamine sniffing off his hand, him dancing at clubs, the shake your butt, I mean every basic clip that we've found of these people wanting to groom your kids.
[03:08:48.702 --> 03:08:51.243]  And the counter is, oh this isn't that widespread.
[03:08:51.563 --> 03:08:53.024]  It's every town, it's every city.
[03:08:53.124 --> 03:08:54.185]  I was in San Diego
[03:08:55.424 --> 03:08:55.985]  We're good to go.
[03:09:07.011 --> 03:09:07.471]  Takeover.
[03:09:07.871 --> 03:09:12.252]  It's definitely a grooming situation where they can touch your kids, get to know your kids.
[03:09:12.292 --> 03:09:13.512]  Oh, they ride on them now?
[03:09:13.632 --> 03:09:14.553]  Oh yeah, and that's all in there too.
[03:09:14.573 --> 03:09:22.635]  They have books in the library from the US to Australia, published in the US, where they teach six-year-olds how to enjoy oral sex.
[03:09:22.715 --> 03:09:22.915]  Right.
[03:09:23.255 --> 03:09:23.875]  And here's the thing.
[03:09:24.475 --> 03:09:28.796]  When I coach basketball, I have to get a background check to do this, to be around kids.
[03:09:29.216 --> 03:09:29.476]  Okay?
[03:09:29.636 --> 03:09:30.156]  And you should.
[03:09:30.176 --> 03:09:31.316]  Yeah, you should, of course.
[03:09:31.537 --> 03:09:32.357]  These people don't do that.
[03:09:32.417 --> 03:09:33.497]  They don't do background checks.
[03:09:33.817 --> 03:09:41.023]  Or if they do, it's very light and they don't really look at their records because we're finding people all the time with the help of others out there.
[03:09:41.103 --> 03:09:43.746]  Yeah, they're not screening it because they're in on the sickness.
[03:09:44.346 --> 03:09:47.009]  Here is the boil-down report with just one.
[03:09:47.049 --> 03:09:51.452]  Right here in town is a prostitute, big surprise, that wants your kids to sit on their lap.
[03:09:51.492 --> 03:09:51.773]  Here it is.
[03:09:52.810 --> 03:09:56.272]  This is Greg Reese reporting from mainland China for InfoWars.com.
[03:09:56.292 --> 03:09:56.772]  That's not it.
[03:09:57.012 --> 03:09:58.513]  You gotta tell them to report it.
[03:09:58.533 --> 03:09:58.934]  Just let me have it.
[03:09:58.954 --> 03:10:00.915]  It's called Ultimate... There it is.
[03:10:00.955 --> 03:10:01.755]  We're gonna get it.
[03:10:01.855 --> 03:10:03.696]  Drag Queen Story Time.
[03:10:03.857 --> 03:10:04.917]  My name is Blackberry.
[03:10:05.057 --> 03:10:06.518]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[03:10:06.718 --> 03:10:09.260]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[03:10:09.380 --> 03:10:12.942]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Story Time.
[03:10:13.042 --> 03:10:14.283]  Drag Queen Story Time.
[03:10:14.423 --> 03:10:21.247]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[03:10:23.123 --> 03:10:28.205]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[03:10:28.325 --> 03:10:30.145]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[03:10:30.746 --> 03:10:32.186]  We can both be grooms.
[03:10:32.306 --> 03:10:36.007]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[03:10:36.127 --> 03:10:39.989]  The hips on the drag queen go swish, swish, swish.
[03:10:40.089 --> 03:10:40.729]  Turn around.
[03:10:42.389 --> 03:10:43.090]  And shake your butt.
[03:10:43.130 --> 03:10:44.370]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em.
[03:10:44.470 --> 03:10:47.631]  It was a first for this branch of the public library too.
[03:10:47.651 --> 03:10:48.531]  Are you nervous?
[03:10:48.751 --> 03:10:48.971]  Yes.
[03:10:48.991 --> 03:10:50.272]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[03:10:51.337 --> 03:10:51.517]  No.
[03:10:52.157 --> 03:10:57.579]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[03:10:57.839 --> 03:11:03.141]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[03:11:03.381 --> 03:11:06.502]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[03:11:06.982 --> 03:11:11.683]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[03:11:11.904 --> 03:11:14.124]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[03:11:14.284 --> 03:11:15.905]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[03:11:20.443 --> 03:11:21.563]  They were all accepting.
[03:11:21.603 --> 03:11:26.086]  They all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[03:11:26.387 --> 03:11:28.148]  The woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs.
[03:11:28.228 --> 03:11:28.888]  It's a man.
[03:11:28.908 --> 03:11:31.410]  This is adult entertainment.
[03:11:31.650 --> 03:11:34.252]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[03:11:34.492 --> 03:11:35.733]  Stardom young, right?
[03:11:35.793 --> 03:11:37.134]  Stardom young, right?
[03:11:40.054 --> 03:11:41.696]  Everyone can do drag.
[03:11:41.976 --> 03:11:44.078]  Everyone can do drag.
[03:11:44.979 --> 03:11:46.480]  I'm all about education.
[03:11:46.760 --> 03:11:48.982]  I actually do story time with drag queens in Chicago.
[03:11:49.002 --> 03:11:49.423]  Right?
[03:11:52.548 --> 03:11:52.668]  Yes!
[03:11:52.768 --> 03:11:54.168]  Family programming!
[03:11:54.889 --> 03:11:55.589]  Love it!
[03:11:55.749 --> 03:11:56.170]  Yes!
[03:11:56.290 --> 03:12:05.155]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[03:12:05.415 --> 03:12:13.820]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[03:12:14.140 --> 03:12:17.422]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[03:12:17.662 --> 03:12:20.485]  This is Tatiana Valina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[03:12:20.705 --> 03:12:22.207]  What has this world come to?
[03:12:22.487 --> 03:12:24.949]  It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[03:12:25.010 --> 03:12:26.331]  And people do ketamine on a couch.
[03:12:28.673 --> 03:12:34.099]  Desmond is the world's youngest club kid, and we challenge you, as the people out there, to find a younger club kid.
[03:12:34.139 --> 03:12:34.699]  Will they find one?
[03:12:35.500 --> 03:12:35.720]  No.
[03:12:36.161 --> 03:12:40.685]  Please welcome Desmond Napolis, aka Desmond Is Amazing!
[03:12:43.385 --> 03:12:44.446]  Yeah, have you been to a nightclub?
[03:12:44.847 --> 03:12:45.047]  No.
[03:12:45.347 --> 03:12:45.507]  No?
[03:12:45.647 --> 03:12:45.988]  Okay.
[03:12:52.574 --> 03:12:56.779]  Drag should be an all-ages thing and some people consider it provocative.
[03:12:57.019 --> 03:12:58.821]  It's not inappropriate.
[03:13:11.302 --> 03:13:13.888]  Teach the children.
[03:13:14.469 --> 03:13:15.171]  Teach the children.
[03:13:16.073 --> 03:13:17.437]  I'm all about education.
[03:13:27.933 --> 03:13:30.374]  And everywhere else it's called pedophilia.
[03:13:30.754 --> 03:13:37.936]  But when it's done institutionally, and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children.
[03:13:37.996 --> 03:13:40.557]  Pull up Tranny Time in the New York schools.
[03:13:40.777 --> 03:13:42.738]  This was put out in the New York Times, like it's wonderful.
[03:13:42.918 --> 03:13:46.859]  And it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[03:13:46.899 --> 03:13:51.741]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with clown makeup on.
[03:13:52.321 --> 03:13:58.231]  Just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children, and you're like, what alternate universe is this?!
[03:13:58.811 --> 03:14:00.294]  What planet did I wake up in?! !
[03:14:02.072 --> 03:14:04.153]  You woke up in the satanic New World Order.
[03:14:04.494 --> 03:14:04.834]  Rob did.
[03:14:05.194 --> 03:14:05.995]  Yeah, you have.
[03:14:06.135 --> 03:14:08.316]  And it's happening right now, and it's accelerating.
[03:14:08.436 --> 03:14:09.957]  It's not just incremental anymore.
[03:14:10.097 --> 03:14:14.600]  It's like they put it into overdrive, and if you don't do anything, if you don't stand up, it's going to run over you.
[03:14:14.620 --> 03:14:15.681]  It's going to run over your kids.
[03:14:16.241 --> 03:14:18.102]  Now, I want to get to this last clip before we go to break.
[03:14:18.542 --> 03:14:20.023]  This is the 17 seconds.
[03:14:20.063 --> 03:14:22.265]  This is Miss Kitty Litter in a promotion she did.
[03:14:22.705 --> 03:14:25.287]  So this is a person who is reading to your kids.
[03:14:25.527 --> 03:14:25.987]  In Austin.
[03:14:26.247 --> 03:14:26.707]  In Austin.
[03:14:26.787 --> 03:14:27.408]  Play that video.
[03:14:30.060 --> 03:14:37.068]  The Austin International Drag Festival happens this year from April 28th to May the 1st.
[03:14:37.508 --> 03:14:41.953]  We want you all to come down and experience some of our southern horse brutality.
[03:14:42.193 --> 03:14:43.915]  I mean hospitality, that is.
[03:14:45.297 --> 03:14:47.639]  And it's a baby in a cooking dish about to be cooked.
[03:14:47.659 --> 03:14:48.260]  They're telling you.
[03:14:48.300 --> 03:14:49.241]  We're killing the kids.
[03:14:49.321 --> 03:14:49.962]  We're raping them.
[03:14:51.167 --> 03:14:52.108]  It's just, it's their religion.
[03:14:52.168 --> 03:14:53.169]  It's admitted right there.
[03:14:53.710 --> 03:14:55.331]  And then you keep finding these people.
[03:14:55.371 --> 03:14:57.473]  Bring your children close to the TV so we can corrupt them.
[03:14:57.834 --> 03:15:02.298]  And it's a convicted guy that cut up his boyfriend with a chainsaw.
[03:15:02.318 --> 03:15:08.063]  Yeah, that's not, and it's hard to put that part into the whole story, but yeah, that guy sitting there was convicted of that and served jail time.
[03:15:08.604 --> 03:15:09.284]  For killing people.
[03:15:09.344 --> 03:15:09.825]  But only 15 years.
[03:15:09.985 --> 03:15:10.145]  Yeah.
[03:15:10.486 --> 03:15:11.607]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[03:15:11.627 --> 03:15:12.928]  And then you got Miss Kitty living here.
[03:15:12.948 --> 03:15:14.649]  This is literal psychotics.
[03:15:15.489 --> 03:15:16.670]  That have taken over the government.
[03:15:16.690 --> 03:15:17.710]  These are their foot soldiers.
[03:15:17.870 --> 03:15:19.131]  And they want to get close to your kids.
[03:15:19.931 --> 03:15:21.572]  And they all dress up like nuns, too.
[03:15:21.652 --> 03:15:23.553]  It's like men in It the Clown comic.
[03:15:23.814 --> 03:15:25.114]  I mean, I would be scared of these people.
[03:15:25.254 --> 03:15:25.735]  Yeah, I know.
[03:15:26.075 --> 03:15:29.016]  And that one you show where you're freaking out, it's that one with the things coming out.
[03:15:29.056 --> 03:15:30.137]  I mean, it looks like a demon.
[03:15:30.357 --> 03:15:33.319]  When you... I'm sorry, it looks like... It's demon pedophile time.
[03:15:34.079 --> 03:15:34.419]  All right.
[03:15:35.460 --> 03:15:39.062]  Earlier I said Dr. Nick Begich, and then I said Mike Adams, because I'm going for memory.
[03:15:39.582 --> 03:15:39.922]  It is.
[03:15:40.162 --> 03:15:40.663]  Every Friday.
[03:15:41.833 --> 03:15:46.837]  The power structure started out with Nazis and other unsavory groups that banned them first to set the precedent.
[03:16:11.189 --> 03:16:19.679]  But now they've moved on to popular populist, like the Yellow Vest Movement, like Tommy Robinson, like Gavin McGinnis, like Laura Loomer.
[03:16:20.380 --> 03:16:23.223]  The whole spectrum of people that are independent and are effective.
[03:16:23.904 --> 03:16:27.208]  There's an attempt to shut that down because they want to control the narrative.
[03:16:28.351 --> 03:16:44.396]  And if that is successful and continuing, it's really a giant electronic iron curtain that Churchill talked about 70 years ago, dropping down across the entire planet, and it's only going to intensify.
[03:16:44.476 --> 03:16:47.457]  So this is a desperate gamble.
[03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:51.873]  Or gambit that's being played by the establishment.
[03:16:52.133 --> 03:16:53.414]  And I don't think it's going to be successful.
[03:16:53.975 --> 03:17:05.244]  I believe in the people, but to have the establishment misrepresent who you are, create a straw man that ban you and then take you down, I don't see that as a position of strength.
[03:17:05.304 --> 03:17:10.208]  I see that as a real position of weakness, and I think it's going to backfire.
[03:17:10.928 --> 03:17:13.270]  Because most people don't do this one time.
[03:17:16.800 --> 03:17:19.741]  In the final equation, I'm in for wars.
[03:17:20.801 --> 03:17:27.804]  And what I've done is already, we have changed the course of human destiny in a big way.
[03:17:28.004 --> 03:17:33.386]  And so if I did one of those things in my life, I would feel fulfilled.
[03:17:34.006 --> 03:17:36.407]  Like I had really done what I was supposed to.
[03:17:37.427 --> 03:17:39.127]  So I intend to continue on.
[03:17:39.888 --> 03:17:41.348]  I continue to try to change the world.
[03:17:42.128 --> 03:17:46.410]  But my dream is to be able to stop what I'm doing.
[03:17:48.358 --> 03:17:50.742]  In the next five years or so.
[03:17:51.864 --> 03:17:53.386]  Because you can't do this forever.
[03:17:53.406 --> 03:17:58.394]  And politically I've hit the zeitgeist four times.
[03:17:59.616 --> 03:18:02.280]  Four times we've already changed the course of the planet.
[03:18:03.280 --> 03:18:07.243]  And I think it's almost bad luck to go for a fifth or a sixth time.
[03:18:07.983 --> 03:18:10.325]  So, it's not that I don't want to fight.
[03:18:10.505 --> 03:18:11.166]  I want to fight.
[03:18:11.246 --> 03:18:18.551]  But it's almost boorish or greedy or pig-like to continue to think that you're supposed to.
[03:18:18.571 --> 03:18:20.933]  Because most people don't do this one time.
[03:18:22.594 --> 03:18:23.855]  Well, four times.
[03:18:25.376 --> 03:18:25.916]  Four times.
[03:18:27.297 --> 03:18:31.320]  We have changed the course of human destiny in a big way.
[03:18:33.977 --> 03:18:43.860]  I just want the fifth time to warn everybody about the tyranny and the censorship and see humanity respond and then step back and fade into shadows.
[03:18:44.620 --> 03:18:45.860]  That's that's really my goal.
[03:18:46.761 --> 03:18:49.341]  But I got a sneaking suspicion that that's not going to happen.
[03:18:50.182 --> 03:18:54.983]  And I think I'm probably going to change paradigms 10 times, 20 times.
[03:18:55.843 --> 03:18:57.964]  So nobody else will do it.
[03:18:58.444 --> 03:18:58.984]  So I got to do it.
[03:19:05.171 --> 03:19:07.772]  It's just heavy, heavy, heavy.
[03:19:08.593 --> 03:19:11.755]  Make no mistake, it's... We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:19:12.635 --> 03:19:13.636]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:19:16.737 --> 03:19:18.498]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[03:19:21.360 --> 03:19:24.461]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[03:19:24.521 --> 03:19:25.542]  It's a form of fascism.
[03:19:26.656 --> 03:19:30.138]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[03:19:30.238 --> 03:19:36.980]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:19:41.562 --> 03:19:45.024]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[03:19:53.187 --> 03:19:54.408]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:19:57.125 --> 03:19:58.186]  You can't watch this.
[03:19:58.486 --> 03:19:58.926]  The movie.
[03:19:59.126 --> 03:20:01.888]  Available now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:20:06.011 --> 03:20:08.613]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:22.013 --> 03:20:28.585]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick baggage.
[03:20:29.206 --> 03:20:31.971]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:34.785 --> 03:20:38.126]  And welcome back to InfoWars and it's August 23rd, 2019.
[03:20:38.366 --> 03:20:42.267]  The 11 o'clock hour in my part of the world.
[03:20:42.327 --> 03:20:48.368]  I'm broadcasting from Anchorage, Alaska routed through the guys in Austin.
[03:20:48.408 --> 03:20:50.509]  I really appreciate everything everyone does.
[03:20:50.569 --> 03:20:51.549]  And I missed last week.
[03:20:51.629 --> 03:20:53.950]  I was in the wilderness, literally.
[03:20:54.310 --> 03:21:00.151]  In the background today, for those who have the video feed, you'll see a little bit about where I was.
[03:21:00.231 --> 03:21:02.172]  It's a property I have with some partners.
[03:21:03.689 --> 03:21:04.350]  Pretty remote.
[03:21:04.410 --> 03:21:07.393]  It's a two-day walk bushwhacking your way in.
[03:21:07.873 --> 03:21:17.603]  We went a little easier this time, but you know, it's an interesting thing because in the valley where my property is, there are no EMF signals.
[03:21:18.123 --> 03:21:25.170]  In fact, to get from where we spent a good bit of our time, it takes an hour to walk to a signal going up 70% grade.
[03:21:27.572 --> 03:21:29.233]  And hoping you can get a signal out.
[03:21:30.154 --> 03:21:31.014]  So it's kind of neat.
[03:21:31.114 --> 03:21:31.895]  It's very unique.
[03:21:32.335 --> 03:21:42.783]  EMFs and the effect of EMFs on the human body has been sort of my area of expertise in terms of public reporting for 25 years.
[03:21:43.263 --> 03:21:52.730]  And, you know, and as a reporter on these issues, I can tell you when you go to the wilderness and you are out of the EMF bubble,
[03:21:54.511 --> 03:21:54.771]  It is.
[03:21:55.272 --> 03:21:55.872]  It's a lift.
[03:21:56.172 --> 03:22:01.897]  I mean, you literally feel such a lift off of you.
[03:22:03.058 --> 03:22:03.859]  You sleep better.
[03:22:04.660 --> 03:22:06.041]  You wake up more energized.
[03:22:06.081 --> 03:22:10.345]  Your focus is incredibly intense when you take that layer off.
[03:22:10.365 --> 03:22:15.389]  And then when you come back into the world, when you step back into what we call the world,
[03:22:16.848 --> 03:22:18.270]  The shock of it hits you.
[03:22:18.330 --> 03:22:19.752]  You know, I'm in a news block.
[03:22:19.772 --> 03:22:21.874]  I can't even get a radio signal in there, okay?
[03:22:22.195 --> 03:22:23.897]  I mean, there's nothing coming in.
[03:22:24.377 --> 03:22:31.646]  So you come out of that, and you are sort of rebirthed into a world that's a bit alien from what you were just experiencing.
[03:22:31.666 --> 03:22:33.969]  It's a little bit of a shock, even after only nine days.
[03:22:35.080 --> 03:22:41.206]  But the importance of all this is it takes you back to a time before radio.
[03:22:41.906 --> 03:22:57.180]  You know, what we're experiencing now is almost a billion times more background radiation, including the 5G and everything else, than existed 100 years ago when this property that I was on was originally patented and began to be developed 120 years ago.
[03:22:58.573 --> 03:23:04.917]  And, you know, when I think back, laying around me in this place are all kinds of remnants of technology of the age.
[03:23:05.357 --> 03:23:15.743]  And I think today where we're at, and the contrast of that, literally walking out of the wilderness is more than a metaphor in the world we live in today.
[03:23:16.804 --> 03:23:22.767]  We are all walking out of our wilderness into our own awakening as to what is important
[03:23:23.451 --> 03:23:29.219]  As stewards of the earth in a different way than the greenie bunny hunters have envisioned for us.
[03:23:29.740 --> 03:23:35.548]  Because, you know, we're here to prosper as human beings and to develop something here in a very different way.
[03:23:35.588 --> 03:23:38.252]  And what the globalists have done is not just rape our
[03:23:39.313 --> 03:23:52.258]  Children, but they've raped our world in a way that has constructed something destructive out of something that is meant to enhance humankind, serve humankind, and the rest of the living organisms on the planet.
[03:23:52.798 --> 03:24:02.541]  And I say that from the standpoint of stewardship, not from the myth of BS environmentalism that's portrayed in much of the mainstream today.
[03:24:03.362 --> 03:24:03.922]  It's quite different.
[03:24:04.679 --> 03:24:11.350]  You know, when I think about the whole 5G rollout, you know, and the whole technocracy and the involvement of it.
[03:24:12.684 --> 03:24:20.168]  25 years ago, over 25 years ago now, my journey of disclosure began along with, parallel with Alex.
[03:24:20.289 --> 03:24:22.990]  We ran into each other early in our efforts.
[03:24:23.431 --> 03:24:30.795]  We combined our efforts in lots of different ways, you know, supporting one another through the years and now more aggressively working together.
[03:24:31.356 --> 03:24:34.538]  Because now is the hour that we all saw coming.
[03:24:35.209 --> 03:24:36.990]  It is five minutes to midnight.
[03:24:37.010 --> 03:24:41.953]  It's time to wake up into the potential that we are and begin to execute in this world a little bit differently.
[03:24:42.533 --> 03:24:43.694]  And that's what we're seeing.
[03:24:43.754 --> 03:24:51.618]  You know, we're seeing the activist model evolve out of the truth that echoes in the soul of every one of us.
[03:24:51.698 --> 03:25:00.363]  And this is what I think gets lost so much in the world as we rise out of this illusion
[03:25:01.471 --> 03:25:05.992]  Fake money, fake food, fake government, fake, fake, fake.
[03:25:07.133 --> 03:25:08.333]  And then they turn it.
[03:25:09.954 --> 03:25:11.214]  And they say, we're that.
[03:25:11.674 --> 03:25:12.974]  No, this is not the case.
[03:25:14.395 --> 03:25:16.255]  You know, we heard from whistleblowers today.
[03:25:18.256 --> 03:25:22.537]  Whistleblowers are needed in our culture and in our society.
[03:25:23.218 --> 03:25:31.100]  You know, those that step forward with the courage of their convictions and lift from them the burden of the slavery of
[03:25:31.906 --> 03:25:33.148]  Intellectual ownership.
[03:25:33.748 --> 03:25:34.670]  You know, think about it.
[03:25:34.890 --> 03:25:40.837]  For a few shekels, for Ether, for fiat currency, Ether, nothing.
[03:25:40.977 --> 03:25:41.878]  Paper, nothing.
[03:25:42.559 --> 03:25:46.024]  They convince people that this is where their security lies.
[03:25:46.504 --> 03:25:47.786]  And it does not.
[03:25:49.007 --> 03:25:50.269]  It absolutely does not.
[03:25:50.894 --> 03:25:52.115]  And here it is.
[03:25:52.435 --> 03:25:57.178]  For someone to step out of that and to step into their truth is a courageous act.
[03:25:57.238 --> 03:25:58.198]  I don't care who you are.
[03:25:58.759 --> 03:26:03.021]  You jeopardize your life, your liberty, your pursuit of happiness, your family, your economy.
[03:26:03.401 --> 03:26:09.245]  You know, you've heard it for the last three hours what happens to people who step into the truth and begin to declare it.
[03:26:11.046 --> 03:26:13.247]  What I say in the face of all of that is
[03:26:13.951 --> 03:26:17.713]  That we need to continue, each of us, to step into the truth that we know each day.
[03:26:18.193 --> 03:26:22.696]  And when we make the mistakes, correct them as rapidly as possible and be accountable for them.
[03:26:22.756 --> 03:26:24.737]  But step into our truth.
[03:26:26.298 --> 03:26:32.181]  Seek that truth from the foundation of what we are as divine, creative human beings.
[03:26:33.162 --> 03:26:36.564]  Whistleblowers deserve the protection of everyone.
[03:26:37.896 --> 03:26:45.821]  Whistleblowers who don't violate the law in such a dramatic way as to imprison themselves, but to enlighten us.
[03:26:45.901 --> 03:26:47.482]  I mean, we need this information.
[03:26:47.502 --> 03:26:53.225]  You know, the Snowdens of the world one day will be the heroes of the world because they had the courage.
[03:26:53.385 --> 03:26:54.266]  That's a big step.
[03:26:54.706 --> 03:26:56.047]  They gave up a lot to do it.
[03:26:58.008 --> 03:27:03.551]  And I think in this moment, perhaps we should remember all these folks, including those activists today on air.
[03:27:04.312 --> 03:27:06.293]  You know, where does free speech begin?
[03:27:07.043 --> 03:27:08.884]  And where does it end in this century?
[03:27:09.364 --> 03:27:17.586]  And this generation, our generation, and the ones that follow are going to decide, are we free or are we slaves?
[03:27:18.586 --> 03:27:22.487]  Are we part of some illusion being pushed upon us?
[03:27:23.467 --> 03:27:27.288]  And then creating that reality with this globalist elite?
[03:27:27.328 --> 03:27:29.129]  Because this is how it actually works, you see.
[03:27:30.487 --> 03:27:50.804]  Is by focusing everyone's attention in a certain way and embedding it with a huge amount of human emotional energy, what was discovered in the mind control programs operated by the CIA and others is that the creative potential of human beings is captured and you can actually shape the reality in front of you.
[03:27:52.265 --> 03:27:55.568]  So what's happened is big media, big tech,
[03:27:56.244 --> 03:28:15.062]  In alliance with elites and governments and actors across many spectrums are now shaping the very reality using the psychic energy, the essence of divinity and corrupting it and twisting it into this ugly thing that we see emerging in the world.
[03:28:15.678 --> 03:28:26.230]  We can take our consciousness back, refocus what we are, take out and lift the fear from us, and recognize the courage of our convictions, and that we do not walk alone.
[03:28:26.651 --> 03:28:30.295]  As we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we have no need to fear evil.
[03:28:31.155 --> 03:28:34.096]  Because we walk in the light of power.
[03:28:34.796 --> 03:28:37.716]  The essence of what we are is human living souls.
[03:28:37.996 --> 03:28:43.077]  And in this day and in this hour, a call is out to rise into your convictions.
[03:28:43.498 --> 03:28:44.658]  Support this network.
[03:28:44.718 --> 03:28:46.018]  Support your own voice.
[03:28:46.538 --> 03:28:49.219]  And be the voice of change in the 21st century.
[03:28:49.679 --> 03:28:50.979]  Take our government back.
[03:28:51.539 --> 03:28:52.839]  Take our world back.
[03:28:53.500 --> 03:28:55.460]  Take humanity back.
[03:28:56.886 --> 03:28:57.867]  This is the Info Wars.
[03:28:57.887 --> 03:28:59.087]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:28:59.127 --> 03:29:01.328]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:29:07.051 --> 03:29:10.793]  Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't a Netflix drama show.
[03:29:10.833 --> 03:29:13.034]  This isn't a Law & Order TV program.
[03:29:13.254 --> 03:29:14.094]  This is not a movie.
[03:29:14.114 --> 03:29:14.935]  This is not a drill.
[03:29:14.975 --> 03:29:15.835]  This is not fiction.
[03:29:16.295 --> 03:29:17.596]  This is reality.
[03:29:18.294 --> 03:29:25.078]  You have a major Google engineer backing up what the other engineers have said, what the documents have shown, and talking about perjury before Congress.
[03:29:25.238 --> 03:29:28.320]  Pray and support this individual and others to come forward.
[03:29:28.360 --> 03:29:29.781]  So, Zach Voorhees, we salute you.
[03:29:29.861 --> 03:29:31.743]  And I'll say this, it's all of our birthright.
[03:29:31.823 --> 03:29:37.526]  Black, white, old, young, gay, straight, whether you're from San Francisco, New York City, or Austin, Texas, or Des Moines, Iowa.
[03:29:37.606 --> 03:29:39.748]  We're all having our birthright stolen right now.
[03:29:39.768 --> 03:29:44.771]  We're seeing election meddling, and it's time to admit it and to realize we've seen a giant backdoor.
[03:29:45.131 --> 03:29:45.331]  I think?
[03:30:01.078 --> 03:30:05.780]  We wouldn't have withstood this withering storm of censorship, attacks, and lies.
[03:30:05.900 --> 03:30:11.263]  We have the new World Awakens Mega Sale Globalist House of Cards Collapsing End of Summer Super Sale.
[03:30:11.383 --> 03:30:18.506]  It's the big, giant, 50-60% off, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot Points, but only on 50-something items, not.
[03:30:18.686 --> 03:30:21.207]  On every item, because a bunch of these are very close to selling out.
[03:30:21.247 --> 03:30:31.072]  Whether it's Ultimate Krill Oil, Body's Turmeric, Brain Force Plus, Knockout Sleep Aid, Turbo Force, 8-Pack Power Stack, it's all 50-60% off, and your purchases make it all possible here.
[03:30:31.192 --> 03:30:43.018]  But an incredible time to be alive, an incredible time to be making history together, and standing up and seeing the good guys wake up, and to see us coming back from zero to basically tying the Globalists right now for a football analogy.
[03:30:43.238 --> 03:30:45.519]  So back to Owen Schroer and Zach Voorhees.
[03:30:45.759 --> 03:30:48.562]  Do you think Google is the biggest threat to U.S.
[03:30:48.622 --> 03:30:49.042]  elections?
[03:30:49.503 --> 03:30:56.770]  I think that, you know, if you want to look at the biggest threat, it's Google together with Facebook, together with Twitter.
[03:30:56.951 --> 03:31:08.403]  They formed this echo chamber in which if they want to apply their control of narratives, then what they're going to do is they're going to press down the voices
[03:31:08.943 --> 03:31:11.805]  But they don't want, and they're going to boost up the voices that they do.
[03:31:11.866 --> 03:31:16.289]  And InfoWars has been sort of the main victim in this.
[03:31:16.890 --> 03:31:29.340]  And it's clear that as, if your audience looks through the disclosure list posted at ProjectVeritas.com, they're going to see InfoWars pop up in numerous blacklists that have been disclosed.
[03:31:29.540 --> 03:31:34.964]  Google's mission statement is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.
[03:31:35.084 --> 03:31:40.428]  When InfoWars was taken offline, was that making information universally accessible and useful?
[03:31:40.448 --> 03:31:41.089]  No, it wasn't.
[03:31:41.329 --> 03:31:47.854]  What do you think comes next in this disclosure of what Google is doing to manipulate U.S.
[03:31:47.894 --> 03:31:48.494]  elections?
[03:31:48.995 --> 03:31:53.038]  And what would you like to say to the Google executives that are engaging in this?
[03:31:54.219 --> 03:31:56.841]  Yeah, well, something quite amazing is happening right now.
[03:31:57.001 --> 03:31:58.762]  Like, there's been a huge document dump.
[03:31:58.802 --> 03:32:04.067]  I've released over 950 pages, and right now there is a crowd raid.
[03:32:05.048 --> 03:32:14.055]  There are a bunch of users, they're looking at these documents, they're digesting them, and they're posting the content of them onto Twitter for us all to see.
[03:32:14.635 --> 03:32:19.660]  And so, you know, one of the things I want to invite for your audience is to come online
[03:32:20.741 --> 03:32:23.563]  Go to Project Veritas, see their disclosure.
[03:32:23.583 --> 03:32:25.464]  They've posted a link to all these documents.
[03:32:25.644 --> 03:32:30.328]  I'm asking your audience to download the everything.zip file and just go to town.
[03:32:30.468 --> 03:32:35.291]  And the thing is, is that whatever you think Google's doing, I promise you, it's way, way worse.
[03:32:35.492 --> 03:32:40.095]  And, you know, I see the reaction online and everyone's like, you know, WTF?
[03:32:40.115 --> 03:32:40.415]  WTF?
[03:32:41.676 --> 03:32:57.122]  I'm like, yes, everyone is now seeing what I've seen privately, and, you know, we're finally having the exposure of light into the darkness, and people are finally understanding what's really going on in America.
[03:33:05.565 --> 03:33:08.246]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.883 --> 03:33:29.586]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich.
[03:33:32.747 --> 03:33:38.169]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com, standing in in this fourth hour for Alex Jones.
[03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:45.893]  And, you know, before the break, just, you know, kind of coming back into decompression mode from being gone.
[03:33:46.633 --> 03:33:49.854]  And I'm still kind of making the adjustment, really.
[03:33:49.975 --> 03:33:50.435]  I mean, it's
[03:33:51.804 --> 03:33:54.488]  It's nice to get out of the world every once in a while.
[03:33:54.508 --> 03:33:55.670]  I recommend it to everyone.
[03:33:55.730 --> 03:34:00.076]  I mean, just to clear your cobwebs and see things a little bit differently.
[03:34:00.096 --> 03:34:03.000]  Not a bad thing to do from time to time.
[03:34:03.040 --> 03:34:04.763]  It gets you kind of back in touch with
[03:34:05.589 --> 03:34:09.132]  What's going on around you from a different perspective, maybe a healthier one?
[03:34:09.152 --> 03:34:18.760]  You know, I want to talk about the 5G thing, and Alex was mentioning a little bit about the heat emanating from cell phones, and this is sort of the root of the problem.
[03:34:18.780 --> 03:34:30.269]  If you go back to Dr. Carlo's work, and you can look his work up on cell phones, he published on the subject the fact that the heat dissipating from cell phones into the skull
[03:34:30.889 --> 03:34:31.130]  Thank you.
[03:34:46.544 --> 03:34:46.945]  Five.
[03:34:47.305 --> 03:34:50.787]  And, you know, later, of course, his work progressed and so did ours.
[03:34:52.088 --> 03:34:59.372]  There were a lot of others in this work that looked at microwave hearing, looked at the effect of microwaves on the human brain, etc., etc.
[03:35:00.653 --> 03:35:06.557]  I testified on this in the European Parliament in the late 90s, which resulted in a whole series of things.
[03:35:07.397 --> 03:35:14.539]  Dealing with electromagnetic field effects, dealing with a little more thorough regulation in Europe.
[03:35:14.559 --> 03:35:16.560]  We never got that here, unfortunately.
[03:35:16.580 --> 03:35:19.261]  What we see now is only getting worse.
[03:35:19.321 --> 03:35:23.082]  What Alex said about 5G is exactly right.
[03:35:23.102 --> 03:35:32.505]  You know, 5G allows you with a much more precision effect target, or should I say, send a signal to a specific cell phone.
[03:35:33.101 --> 03:35:38.606]  And then affect that cell phone in numerous ways based on the ability to manipulate its onboard electronics.
[03:35:38.986 --> 03:35:51.156]  You know, it's kind of like we have invited into our homes a device that saves the NSA and the CIA and the FBI and anybody else commercially or otherwise the trouble of bugging your home.
[03:35:52.677 --> 03:35:55.559]  I mean, come on, we all give it up for nothing, you know?
[03:35:55.619 --> 03:36:02.465]  I mean, here we are, the most transparent civilization on the planet with the most opaque governments in the world.
[03:36:03.889 --> 03:36:05.949]  Stop for a moment, let me restate that.
[03:36:06.069 --> 03:36:16.212]  We have become the most transparent people on the planet through artificial intelligence, while our government has hidden behind a wall of secrecy.
[03:36:16.572 --> 03:36:25.714]  I don't care where you live in the world and where you're hearing this broadcast, whether it's in China, the United States, Great Britain, or Afghanistan, it's the same deal.
[03:36:26.874 --> 03:36:32.695]  The people at the top are screwing us all equally, using our religions to divide us, using our
[03:36:33.450 --> 03:36:41.452]  Philosophies to divide us, to create identity politics at an extreme level in every realm of the world and everywhere we travel.
[03:36:41.773 --> 03:36:45.694]  To divide and conquer the human spirit and we cannot allow it.
[03:36:47.374 --> 03:36:48.975]  This is not who we are.
[03:36:49.775 --> 03:36:54.496]  This is not about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness anymore.
[03:36:55.297 --> 03:36:59.558]  That is what's being removed from us on a wholesale basis across the planet.
[03:37:01.468 --> 03:37:23.701]  We're all being infected by the same disorder propagated by an elite that wishes to make humanity slaves and has largely succeeded with the illusion of fiat currency and what 2,000 years ago the Greeks referred to as wage slaves and even before we've accepted as the status quo.
[03:37:25.042 --> 03:37:26.723]  Our humanity has been replaced.
[03:37:27.637 --> 03:37:35.841]  By AI on so many levels, and now the very consciousness of man is being used to fuel the incubator of death.
[03:37:36.902 --> 03:37:47.807]  Take your brains back, take your consciousness back, start using our intellect, combine it with our heart, begin to project in the world the way we were intended, and take it back.
[03:37:48.639 --> 03:38:05.255]  One step at a time, do it in the way that is intended, which is not as some violent, crazy revolution, but a revolution of heart and mind joined together, an awakening that's long been predicted and is happening now in the midst of the traumas we're witnessing around the world.
[03:38:06.116 --> 03:38:11.461]  And either we're going to be a part of altering that force or we're just going to blow into it.
[03:38:12.705 --> 03:38:14.006]  And I'm not willing to do that.
[03:38:14.046 --> 03:38:15.668]  And a lot of people who listen aren't either.
[03:38:17.210 --> 03:38:20.193]  So we keep talking until they shut us up for good.
[03:38:20.673 --> 03:38:22.635]  And then we'll see y'all on the other side.
[03:38:23.075 --> 03:38:27.139]  Because whether we know it or not, we're all in it together.
[03:38:27.680 --> 03:38:29.422]  And no one's getting out alive.
[03:38:31.784 --> 03:38:33.466]  And it's kind of the nature of life, right?
[03:38:33.606 --> 03:38:35.688]  I mean, I can laugh a little bit about it because
[03:38:37.529 --> 03:38:39.432]  No matter what happens in the end, we win.
[03:38:40.072 --> 03:38:43.817]  We just got to persevere through it and find some joy in it.
[03:38:44.719 --> 03:38:45.880]  And so that's where it's important.
[03:38:45.900 --> 03:38:49.565]  You know, turn off the devices for a while.
[03:38:50.106 --> 03:38:51.708]  Connect with your friends and family.
[03:38:51.768 --> 03:38:52.109]  Make it
[03:38:52.949 --> 03:38:55.731]  Your daily duty, you know, to do that.
[03:38:56.271 --> 03:39:01.934]  Set your intentions in the morning when you get up, you know, to break the cycle of fear and anxiety.
[03:39:02.074 --> 03:39:07.557]  Because, and I said it often, you know, when you think about mind control effects, I'm going to talk about 5G.
[03:39:07.597 --> 03:39:09.538]  If you can pulse modulate a signal,
[03:39:10.180 --> 03:39:18.847]  You can create a general sense of anxiety and agitation over the entire covered grid that operates as sort of a background noise.
[03:39:18.867 --> 03:39:22.510]  And what that does, that oscillation just keeps you aggravated.
[03:39:23.631 --> 03:39:25.453]  And let me tell you something.
[03:39:25.473 --> 03:39:30.938]  When that happens, the brain, you look at it with an EEG, and this is science, folks.
[03:39:31.358 --> 03:39:33.099]  You can see exactly what happens.
[03:39:33.460 --> 03:39:37.223]  You roll into your reptilian mode of flight and fight responses.
[03:39:37.263 --> 03:39:38.324]  You roll back here.
[03:39:39.002 --> 03:39:45.345]  This turns off, you know, the part that really needs to be engaged, you know, and it disconnects.
[03:39:45.926 --> 03:39:54.870]  The two halves of the brain sort of go tweak, disconnect, you fall into survival mode where what you need to happen is calm.
[03:39:55.811 --> 03:39:55.991]  Why?
[03:39:56.767 --> 03:40:12.812]  Voice in your head, in your body, allows you to calm yourself enough so that higher order thinking can combine with heart and you can function with both hemispheres the way God intended to be at the optimum level of human performance.
[03:40:13.412 --> 03:40:15.593]  This is what human beings are intended to do.
[03:40:16.093 --> 03:40:24.896]  Balanced hemisphere with energy flowing through your system, connecting you to the universal because
[03:40:25.649 --> 03:40:27.990]  That's what you were created to be.
[03:40:28.010 --> 03:40:38.672]  This is your carrier, ladies and gentlemen, this body you wear is your carrier covering a spirit that has much greater bandwidth than the regulation of a human form.
[03:40:38.732 --> 03:40:45.774]  You know, you can only hear a certain frequency, you can only see a certain bandwidth, you can only feel certain things, you can only taste certain things.
[03:40:46.014 --> 03:40:46.194]  But
[03:40:47.040 --> 03:40:53.104]  The essence of what you are has a limitless bandwidth, if you will, if you want to think about it that way.
[03:40:53.525 --> 03:40:58.468]  The other guys think about it that way, and they want to modulate your bandwidth.
[03:40:58.568 --> 03:41:08.235]  They want to control your perception of the world and reality, and then they want to take your energy and redirect it so the vision of the world is theirs.
[03:41:09.466 --> 03:41:19.032]  This is what media and the multimedia matrix has done, is they have programmed the planet, cross cultures.
[03:41:19.333 --> 03:41:32.942]  You see it no matter where you travel, you will see this laying on top of it, which is embedding this agitation, this cage of agitation, this
[03:41:33.772 --> 03:41:39.376]  Prison of energy surrounding us to hold us captive.
[03:41:40.857 --> 03:41:42.438]  This is what's happening right now.
[03:41:42.998 --> 03:41:43.319]  You know?
[03:41:43.879 --> 03:41:50.023]  And we've been talking about it from a lot of different angles, you know, for a quarter of a century and longer.
[03:41:50.143 --> 03:41:55.207]  You know, people came before us too and talked about this whole thing happening.
[03:41:55.247 --> 03:41:58.709]  And this isn't some predictive model from some esoteric source.
[03:41:59.390 --> 03:42:00.330]  Read the books.
[03:42:00.570 --> 03:42:02.211]  You know, I took a look again
[03:42:03.706 --> 03:42:09.730]  This morning at that book I wrote, now almost 20 years ago, Earthrise and the Revolution.
[03:42:10.110 --> 03:42:15.734]  The only place you can find it right now, if you want a hard copy, is Infowars.com.
[03:42:16.535 --> 03:42:26.041]  Because I'm just not able to keep them out there any other way, but if you read it, just looking at the table of contents, you'll see all the topics of the day.
[03:42:26.702 --> 03:42:29.964]  The first article I wrote on cell phones was 1999, published in Explorer magazine.
[03:42:32.199 --> 03:42:36.041]  All of those things, in real time now, are happening.
[03:42:36.821 --> 03:42:37.541]  What can we do?
[03:42:37.721 --> 03:42:39.202]  We can wake up to what we are.
[03:42:39.302 --> 03:42:40.803]  We can begin doing what we can do.
[03:42:41.223 --> 03:42:42.343]  Not what we can't do.
[03:42:43.044 --> 03:42:48.226]  Do what you know you can do to further the cause of freedom and liberty in a peaceful way, and it's enough.
[03:42:49.306 --> 03:42:49.786]  It's enough.
[03:42:49.806 --> 03:42:51.687]  If all of us do that, it's enough.
[03:42:52.087 --> 03:42:53.288]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:42:53.328 --> 03:42:55.769]  We'll be right back after these brief messages.
[03:43:02.523 --> 03:43:14.000]  We were winning, Antifa was over, the culture wars had been won, it was time to gloat, we were winning the meme war, everyone was laughing, and then...
[03:43:15.305 --> 03:43:19.488]  You get depersoned to the point where you don't exist.
[03:43:19.728 --> 03:43:21.289]  Like, Laura Loomer had to leave New York.
[03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:27.273]  She's living in a place, I don't think I can even say, across from a police station so they can get there fast.
[03:43:27.873 --> 03:43:30.615]  Stephen Crowder's had to move many times.
[03:43:31.136 --> 03:43:32.597]  Dana Lash's had to move.
[03:43:33.097 --> 03:43:35.659]  And when these people move, they don't make it a slow decision.
[03:43:35.679 --> 03:43:37.340]  They have to pack up in the middle of the night.
[03:43:37.860 --> 03:43:38.781]  I'm gonna have to move.
[03:43:42.042 --> 03:43:46.665]  Tommy Robertson has to move, and he has done so several times.
[03:43:49.106 --> 03:44:05.376]  So, I think you have these negligent, family-less media sources trivializing these allegations because it makes for a salacious headline, but they don't realize that they endanger people's lives, and like, they put these people's children in danger.
[03:44:06.650 --> 03:44:21.975]  You know, Dana Lash's kids have a, have a, you know, most, most, actually I shouldn't just say Dana Lash, most of these conservatives have spoken to their principals about attack plans and what happens if there's a threat to the school, not to the school, but to the student or something like that.
[03:44:23.667 --> 03:44:31.570]  So, it's a strange dichotomy where you have this incredibly severe punishment for the right.
[03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:35.791]  But the people doling out the punishment are these flaky babysitters.
[03:44:36.471 --> 03:44:39.292]  Like the SPLC can shut down my life.
[03:44:39.852 --> 03:44:43.553]  And then you read their articles and it says, you want bigots, Gavin?
[03:44:43.573 --> 03:44:44.574]  This is how you get bigots.
[03:44:44.954 --> 03:44:46.554]  Talking like a bratty babysitter.
[03:44:47.254 --> 03:44:48.855]  So, you have
[03:44:50.307 --> 03:44:55.091]  You have someone who wants to replace the judicial system, basically, with their own kangaroo court.
[03:44:55.771 --> 03:44:59.994]  SPLC's like that, ADL's like that, the media's like that, they're judge, jury, and executioner.
[03:45:00.014 --> 03:45:04.137]  And you think, okay, if you're going to take over hundreds of years of justice,
[03:45:05.287 --> 03:45:06.588]  You better be real thorough.
[03:45:07.148 --> 03:45:11.311]  Because you're basically saying you're better than millions of people in hundreds of years.
[03:45:11.551 --> 03:45:12.612]  Maybe thousands of years.
[03:45:13.492 --> 03:45:15.094]  And then they're so flippant about it.
[03:45:15.614 --> 03:45:17.455]  So they're doing this the same with conservatives.
[03:45:17.475 --> 03:45:23.759]  They're just sort of assuming someone said something, taking it out of context, and then just destroying it.
[03:45:23.819 --> 03:45:27.422]  But it's been an underhanded trick of warfare for a long time.
[03:45:27.482 --> 03:45:30.564]  I mean, the English did it to the Americans in the American Revolution.
[03:45:31.044 --> 03:45:33.346]  The English did it to the Boers in the Boer War.
[03:45:36.048 --> 03:45:38.210]  It's a common trick that weak people do.
[03:45:38.770 --> 03:45:40.972]  It's a common trick people do who don't have families.
[03:45:42.033 --> 03:45:50.741]  And so they say, I'm going to call this guy a Nazi without thinking that his son is going to get, you know, accosted due to these rumors.
[03:45:51.682 --> 03:45:52.863]  I don't think they really believe it.
[03:45:53.984 --> 03:45:59.208]  When they talk about white supremacy, I don't believe them that they think it's a big threat.
[03:46:00.429 --> 03:46:02.810]  I think they're... they're just... it's a game to them.
[03:46:03.690 --> 03:46:07.512]  And it's kind of the problem with the death of the family is everything becomes a silly game.
[03:46:08.612 --> 03:46:12.554]  Make no mistake, it's... we're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:12.654 --> 03:46:14.375]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:16.755 --> 03:46:18.456]  If you have a corrupt media, you don't have a democracy.
[03:46:21.377 --> 03:46:24.478]  I don't think we've seen division like this in America since Vietnam.
[03:46:24.538 --> 03:46:25.619]  It's a form of fascism.
[03:46:26.673 --> 03:46:30.155]  The High Court will examine free speech rights and social media.
[03:46:30.255 --> 03:46:36.977]  Multiple online platforms have now taken down content associated with Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[03:46:41.579 --> 03:46:45.041]  First they come for Alex Jones, everyone else like Davos would fall.
[03:46:53.204 --> 03:46:54.425]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:46:57.142 --> 03:46:58.183]  You can't watch this.
[03:46:58.503 --> 03:47:01.906]  The movie available now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:47:06.510 --> 03:47:09.113]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.297 --> 03:47:32.380]  The Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on, for your mind, with Nick Begich.
[03:47:33.761 --> 03:47:41.404]  And welcome back this Friday, August 23rd, 2019, in the 11 o'clock hour for me in Alaska.
[03:47:41.444 --> 03:47:50.607]  You know that I had this great trip, I've mentioned a few of the segments today, out on my property, about 812 acres in the Wrangell-St.
[03:47:50.647 --> 03:47:52.988]  Elias National Park, largest national park.
[03:47:53.950 --> 03:48:03.594]  In the United States and it's a multi-use property we're developing out there step-by-step and it took me so long to walk, you know, a few weeks every summer.
[03:48:04.314 --> 03:48:15.638]  This summer, one of my partners, Matt Roddard from Anchor Point, he and I went out and we're walking through an area, areas that we have never walked before and haven't been walked in a hundred years.
[03:48:16.218 --> 03:48:28.448]  And discovered we actually had on the property a waterfall that's over 100 feet high dropping into a canyon, a closed box canyon, that we also have on this property we had never seen before.
[03:48:29.329 --> 03:48:39.196]  So pretty interesting, you know, and while we're out there, you know, and we're going through this area, there's quite a bit of underground workings that have been left behind from 100 years ago.
[03:48:39.216 --> 03:48:41.118]  Some of the things that were poking around
[03:48:41.238 --> 03:48:41.558]  We're good.
[03:49:02.864 --> 03:49:08.748]  How your energy sort of begins to sort of resist all that.
[03:49:08.808 --> 03:49:13.091]  You know, it's like when the power fails in your community, and this is a great example of it.
[03:49:13.131 --> 03:49:27.081]  When it goes down, the power grid shuts off, your whole body just kind of contracts, just relaxes, because you don't have this constant thing that you gradually gotten used to, this sort of pressure on your system, if you will.
[03:49:27.660 --> 03:49:30.104]  It's like the background noise in a crowded room.
[03:49:30.124 --> 03:49:33.270]  You begin to ignore it and it comes on so slowly you don't even notice.
[03:49:34.125 --> 03:49:37.586]  And this is what has happened with EMFs and their effect on us.
[03:49:38.106 --> 03:49:43.207]  Now, the idea of individuals being targeted by EMFs is not anything new.
[03:49:43.467 --> 03:49:55.530]  In fact, the technology is designed to create a more precision signal directed in a more particular way at much higher bandwidths and data feeds.
[03:49:55.591 --> 03:49:56.871]  And this is what it's all about.
[03:49:56.951 --> 03:49:57.251]  Because
[03:49:57.871 --> 03:50:12.235]  As we've learned more about the brain and the body and sort of how it connects, we've also learned how to intervene, how to step in and alter the modulations, the natural ones in the body, to change cell states or conditions.
[03:50:12.275 --> 03:50:15.256]  So you can affect people's psychology, brain activity.
[03:50:15.676 --> 03:50:16.916]  That's pretty easy to do.
[03:50:17.657 --> 03:50:22.318]  With more energy and more directed energy in a specific way, you can target any element.
[03:50:22.558 --> 03:50:32.943]  You can create a resonance that will harmonize with any element in the body, any molecular structure within the body, or any body organ, any cell complex.
[03:50:33.604 --> 03:50:41.888]  Virtually anything can be stimulated with a signal externally to create a resonance effect that will change its behavior within the human system.
[03:50:42.388 --> 03:50:55.636]  So, the entire human system is actually modulated by very slight, very fine signals that tell everything what to do, and then that manifests as physical form through chemistry and through our biology.
[03:50:56.156 --> 03:50:58.898]  So, the biologist only sees their vision.
[03:50:59.478 --> 03:51:01.439]  The chemist only sees their vision.
[03:51:01.980 --> 03:51:09.804]  The physicist sees only the mathematics that drives it and the energy fields that support it, that create it out of the nothingness.
[03:51:10.404 --> 03:51:10.705]  All right?
[03:51:12.034 --> 03:51:21.903]  When all these guys actually communicate with each other, they get a bigger picture of how it all interrelates, and that's called integrated science.
[03:51:22.103 --> 03:51:28.308]  It's what the Soviets did before the Russians, and the Russians, in terms of their experimental and developmental models, continue.
[03:51:28.829 --> 03:51:32.252]  Because integration of science is where the greater knowledge lies.
[03:51:32.947 --> 03:51:34.328]  And in the U.S., we do the opposite.
[03:51:34.589 --> 03:51:44.478]  We compartmentalize, we subdivide, we hack it up, and it becomes so inefficient, and it also misses so many of the main points, that it allows an economy a fraction of our size.
[03:51:45.799 --> 03:51:57.971]  Like Russia, and I'm not being critical here at all of Russia, in fact, I compliment them on their wisdom in approaching science from the standpoint of integration, because this is where science happens, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:51:58.351 --> 03:52:12.315]  As a reporter in the sciences, I learned a lot across a lot of disciplines, so I could at least try and articulate something in a way that we can all embrace it and understand it and footnote it adequately so the scientists can go and test my sources.
[03:52:13.335 --> 03:52:19.936]  Because that's what makes the work that many of us have done credible, is the source documentation.
[03:52:20.377 --> 03:52:25.998]  You know, when you look at Alex Jones, over time it's the source documentation
[03:52:26.590 --> 03:52:32.755]  You know, in the earlier segments, he was talking about the pedophile rings and all that stuff we were hearing 25 years ago.
[03:52:33.195 --> 03:52:36.058]  And I'm on board with Alex on that one, man.
[03:52:36.078 --> 03:52:38.019]  Back then, I went, really?
[03:52:38.240 --> 03:52:40.221]  Can this really be happening?
[03:52:40.281 --> 03:52:42.383]  I mean, really?
[03:52:43.003 --> 03:52:44.144]  It was so crazy.
[03:52:44.224 --> 03:52:45.606]  I mean, it was so out there.
[03:52:45.746 --> 03:52:54.573]  And then, as I watch over the last 25 years, each level of enfoldment, in terms of the truth of that, and then I think about it now.
[03:52:55.785 --> 03:53:06.674]  With what I know and what I've seen in now four generations of government, my family being engaged in government from the U.S.
[03:53:06.754 --> 03:53:07.675]  Senate, U.S.
[03:53:07.695 --> 03:53:11.117]  House, State Senate, local levels, international.
[03:53:12.018 --> 03:53:24.288]  And this is what I know, that these things that were so gross in terms of those issues, this is the fuel of too much government, you see.
[03:53:25.058 --> 03:53:43.732]  Because through the fraternities of the Ivy League schools, where the rituals that bind the alumni, because they all know something about each other that would be so embarrassing, their careers would be crushed, like dust, if the world knew.
[03:53:44.552 --> 03:53:53.879]  Because the world they play in takes whatever they are, whatever they've done, and they let them get into those high positions, and they tell them.
[03:53:54.671 --> 03:53:55.552]  Too many of them.
[03:53:56.112 --> 03:53:56.633]  What to do?
[03:53:57.173 --> 03:53:59.055]  J. Edgar Hoover was famous for this.
[03:53:59.075 --> 03:54:07.562]  You know, this is part of why I believe certain people disappeared, including my dad, in the 1970s.
[03:54:08.042 --> 03:54:14.768]  And others were killed through the 60s and 70s and 80s and 90s and even to this day.
[03:54:15.849 --> 03:54:20.032]  There are too many dead men that can't tell any tales.
[03:54:21.073 --> 03:54:23.475]  And they aren't tales, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:54:25.465 --> 03:54:45.391]  They are the blackmail tools of the elite that they've used to rape our government, steal our democracies, and substitute a technocracy that seeks to destroy and control every breath we take, every move we make, and every free voice that we emerge into.
[03:54:47.052 --> 03:54:51.973]  And now is the time for our voices to be heard, not in a violent
[03:54:53.579 --> 03:55:00.409]  Reach out to whoever your congressional leadership is and let them know what is important to you.
[03:55:00.809 --> 03:55:07.579]  Whatever that issue is, let them know and take at least that much of your power back.
[03:55:08.240 --> 03:55:10.401]  And you may feel none of them are listening.
[03:55:10.441 --> 03:55:20.365]  You only need one voice in the right place in the right moment to change the world into a different place.
[03:55:21.105 --> 03:55:37.652]  In this moment is our power and we must rise into it as individuals created in the image and likeness of God to do something and not be the sheeple that others would have us be.
[03:55:38.644 --> 03:55:41.966]  And I'm not saying do things that are impossible.
[03:55:42.226 --> 03:55:44.768]  I'm not saying do things that you don't think you can do.
[03:55:45.288 --> 03:55:47.810]  I'm saying only do what you think you can do.
[03:55:48.130 --> 03:55:50.131]  What you believe in your heart you can achieve.
[03:55:50.571 --> 03:55:54.714]  Because that, my friends, is the essence of creative faith.
[03:55:55.514 --> 03:55:58.296]  It's as simple as acting on what you know.
[03:55:58.756 --> 03:55:59.897]  To be right and true.
[03:55:59.937 --> 03:56:00.697]  To be just.
[03:56:00.797 --> 03:56:03.199]  To be as correct as you can be.
[03:56:03.379 --> 03:56:08.062]  And then, if you're surprised and you've made error, fix it fast.
[03:56:08.937 --> 03:56:15.162]  Take responsibility quickly and then learn from that error and let it be the foundation of a brighter wisdom.
[03:56:16.683 --> 03:56:23.749]  Think of the lessons as a discipline of a father teaching you that lesson, not to be forgotten, but to be remembered.
[03:56:24.670 --> 03:56:29.834]  Our mistakes are the foundation of our learning, whether we're two years old or 60.
[03:56:29.874 --> 03:56:30.394]  Learn.
[03:56:33.482 --> 03:56:50.530]  Roe, assert the power that you are and affect the world around you, starting with the union that you have with your spouse, with your family, with your friends, and build a foundation of truth based on relationship and the power of the human voice pressed against the oppressor.
[03:56:51.650 --> 03:57:00.574]  It's always started there, you see, by the courage of people stepping into their convictions, speaking their truth, not in an offensive way,
[03:57:01.408 --> 03:57:06.149]  Not in a way that tears down another, but recognize their divinity too and the right to disagree.
[03:57:07.050 --> 03:57:14.292]  And this is why the freedom of speech issue, that is the foundation of this network, has to be carried to the highest places in government.
[03:57:14.712 --> 03:57:20.974]  And government now needs to intervene, and this administration now needs to intervene to make sure our voices are not silenced ever.
[03:57:22.114 --> 03:57:30.417]  But are always there, whether you agree or disagree, you can change the channel, you can turn down the volume, do whatever you wish, but do not silence our voices.
[03:57:32.054 --> 03:57:37.058]  Do not silence our voices and everyone that's listening, infuse this network today.
[03:57:37.919 --> 03:57:47.286]  Infuse this network going into this end of our summer and let it be the beginning of the end of the New World Order.
[03:57:47.346 --> 03:57:50.448]  This is Dr. Nick Begich and you've been listening to the InfoWoods.
[03:57:53.150 --> 03:57:59.816]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on air 25 years and I've never at a gut level felt
[03:58:01.701 --> 03:58:06.364]  The fire of war, like I do right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:07.405 --> 03:58:09.146]  So many incredible things are happening.
[03:58:09.787 --> 03:58:11.608]  So many dangerous things are unfolding.
[03:58:12.228 --> 03:58:15.491]  And at a cellular level, at a spiritual gut level.
[03:58:16.877 --> 03:58:34.791]  At the heart of my gut, the heart of my mind, at every level, I can just feel the evil rage of the globalists, knowing that their plan for world government, and their plan for total censorship, and their plan for human-animal clones, and sex with children, and Satanism is in trouble.
[03:58:34.891 --> 03:58:38.174]  It can feel the spirit of Christ coming back into the world.
[03:58:38.314 --> 03:58:39.375]  There's gonna be a tribulation.
[03:58:39.915 --> 03:58:40.455]  We're good to go.
