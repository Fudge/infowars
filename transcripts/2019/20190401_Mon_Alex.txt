[00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:06.789]  It's April 1st, 2019.
[00:00:06.789 --> 00:00:09.732]  And the left has pulled a lot of April Fool's jokes on us.
[00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:13.656]  They say it's okay that Joe Biden likes to grope women because it only happened once.
[00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:16.279]  The shocking evidence that will bring him down straight ahead.
[00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:17.860]  And so much more, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.728]  But first, let's get to this key report and look at how everything The Globalist is touching is falling apart, just like with AOC.
[00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:33.247]  After reading the Green New Deal, I'm mostly afraid of not being able to get through this speech with a straight face.
[00:00:45.393 --> 00:00:50.302]  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had set the table at a House committee meeting.
[00:00:50.302 --> 00:00:57.917]  Flailing around with Beto-esque zeal, AOC passionately pretended to have a grip on the science of climate change.
[00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:01.105]  This is not an elitist issue.
[00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:03.387]  This is a quality of life issue.
[00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:10.312]  You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist?
[00:01:10.312 --> 00:01:16.197]  Tell that to the kids in the South Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.
[00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:18.799]  Even Cortez's asthma claims fell short.
[00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.901]  I don't think so.
[00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:21.962]  I don't think so.
[00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:34.757]  Fox Business host Charles Payne cited several studies including a Columbia University study from 2013 that stated cockroach and mouse allergens are more common in lower-income housing and neighborhoods.
[00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:44.081]  As well as a New York Times study from 2003 in which social workers said they encountered furniture and carpets covered in dust in the Bronx and Harlem.
[00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:49.964]  These two studies show the likely culprit behind the asthma Cortez was flailing about.
[00:01:49.964 --> 00:02:02.410]  This is a picture of Aquaman, a superhero from the undersea kingdom of Atlantis, and notably here, a founding member of the Super Friends.
[00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.251]  I draw your attention, Mr. President,
[00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:10.117]  To the 20-foot impressive seahorse he's riding.
[00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:13.940]  Under the Green New Deal, this is probably Hawaii's best bet.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.106]  Now, I'm the first to admit that a massive fleet of giant, highly-trained seahorses would be cool.
[00:02:22.106 --> 00:02:25.128]  It would be really, really awesome.
[00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:28.911]  But we have to consider a few things.
[00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:34.736]  We have no idea about scalability or domestic capacity in this sector.
[00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:55.130]  The last thing we want is to ban all airplanes and only then find out that China or Russia may have already established strategic hippocampus programs designed to cut the United States out of the global market.
[00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.813]  Mr. President, we must not allow and cannot tolerate
[00:02:59.682 --> 00:03:01.364]  A giant seahorse gap.
[00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:08.670]  Every Democratic senator who is currently running for president has embraced the Green New Deal.
[00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:18.839]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell sprung the vote on the reluctant Democrats, some of which, including Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona,
[00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:30.250]  Doug Jones of Alabama and Angus King of Maine sided with the Republicans by voting no, while 43 of the Democrats hid behind procedure by merely voting present.
[00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:41.441]  A show of cold feet amongst Senate Democratic presidential candidates with zero guts to back up the madness of Cortez who blamed McConnell for the resounding defeat in a tweet.
[00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:54.329]  In the end, AOC's United Nations Agenda 2030 climate change scheme, known now as the Green New Deal, was voted down with zero yeas and 57 nays.
[00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.050]  You know, we talk about cost.
[00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.053]  We're going to pay for this whether we pass the Green New Deal or not.
[00:04:02.053 --> 00:04:10.178]  A no vote on the Green New Deal is a vote against a government takeover of our economy,
[00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:22.273]  That would stifle economic growth, bankrupt our nation, and endanger the prosperity of all Americans.
[00:04:22.273 --> 00:04:33.396]  A no vote is a vote in favor of continuing an open and free economy that has made America the richest country in the world.
[00:04:33.396 --> 00:04:38.637]  And we find that the best way to do environmental improvement
[00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:45.167]  is to use the wealth of a nation to accomplish that goal.
[00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:49.232]  Better luck next time, Cortez, if there is a next time.
[00:04:49.232 --> 00:04:54.699]  One year ago, I was waitressing in a taco shop in downtown Manhattan.
[00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:55.860]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:05:00.365 --> 00:05:05.027]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:05:05.027 --> 00:05:09.269]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:17.213]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:20.334]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:23.816]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:28.276]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:30.318]  We are the power structure.
[00:05:30.318 --> 00:05:31.939]  We are the inventors.
[00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.700]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.102]  And the globalists understand that.
[00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:44.227]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[00:05:44.227 --> 00:05:48.030]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[00:05:49.068 --> 00:06:00.776]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at m4store.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:06:00.776 --> 00:06:07.241]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:14.505]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread, and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:06:14.505 --> 00:06:16.567]  We're beholden to scum!
[00:06:16.567 --> 00:06:17.868]  Russian scum!
[00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:26.890]  Please listen.
[00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:35.195]  If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:39.338]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:06:39.338 --> 00:06:41.339]  Sleep.
[00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:43.300]  Sleep.
[00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.701]  Sleep.
[00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:45.142]  Oh my God!
[00:06:45.142 --> 00:06:45.722]  Oh my God!
[00:06:45.722 --> 00:06:46.182]  Oh my God!
[00:06:46.182 --> 00:06:46.963]  Lock the door!
[00:06:46.963 --> 00:06:47.463]  Lock the door!
[00:06:47.463 --> 00:06:48.344]  They're coming!
[00:06:48.344 --> 00:06:49.484]  They're coming!
[00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:50.225]  Help!
[00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:50.945]  Help!
[00:06:50.945 --> 00:06:51.866]  They're coming!
[00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:52.606]  They're coming!
[00:06:52.606 --> 00:06:53.547]  Listen to me!
[00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:54.027]  Listen!
[00:06:54.027 --> 00:06:54.247]  Help me!
[00:06:55.903 --> 00:06:56.363]  You're next!
[00:06:56.363 --> 00:06:56.563]  Please!
[00:06:56.563 --> 00:06:57.184]  Please!
[00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:57.704]  You're next!
[00:06:57.704 --> 00:06:58.744]  They're in danger!
[00:06:58.744 --> 00:06:59.825]  Please, listen to me!
[00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:00.985]  Something terrible!
[00:07:00.985 --> 00:07:01.686]  Please!
[00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:02.126]  You're next!
[00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:02.906]  Here they are!
[00:07:02.906 --> 00:07:04.327]  They're already here!
[00:07:04.327 --> 00:07:04.907]  Come!
[00:07:04.907 --> 00:07:05.968]  You're next!
[00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:06.828]  They're coming!
[00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:07.548]  They're coming!
[00:07:07.548 --> 00:07:09.349]  It's the guns of sleep.
[00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:10.490]  The seed is planted.
[00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.431]  Sleep.
[00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:13.371]  Sleep.
[00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.832]  Terror grows.
[00:07:14.832 --> 00:07:17.013]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:07:17.013 --> 00:07:18.593]  That's you when you sleep!
[00:07:18.593 --> 00:07:19.954]  Sit up!
[00:07:19.954 --> 00:07:22.115]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.652]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites.
[00:07:25.652 --> 00:07:27.093]  Is it contagious?
[00:07:27.093 --> 00:07:29.135]  It looked right at me.
[00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:32.437]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[00:07:32.437 --> 00:07:35.540]  It was not human.
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.722]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:07:38.722 --> 00:07:40.524]  We're being cornered!
[00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:44.307]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:08:15.197 --> 00:08:17.818]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:17.818 --> 00:08:25.181]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:33.165]  If you go up to InfoWars.com, you'll see articles put together by us.
[00:08:33.165 --> 00:08:35.686]  Videos five years ago, six years ago.
[00:08:35.686 --> 00:08:38.987]  You'll see Paul Watson's video from a couple years ago.
[00:08:38.987 --> 00:08:40.568]  Creepy Uncle Joe Biden.
[00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:47.584]  We first began to point out that Joe Biden can't keep his hands off any little girls or any women.
[00:08:47.584 --> 00:08:52.849]  Runs his fingers through their hair, kisses them, rubs their sides, rubs their buttocks.
[00:08:52.849 --> 00:09:05.442]  And if you look at the big composite image up on the front page of DrugsReport.com, you zoom in, it's all the different faces, or at least some of them, of the girls crying in one shot.
[00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.911]  The woman is playing a flute.
[00:09:07.911 --> 00:09:09.752]  It's probably one of the most haunting videos.
[00:09:09.752 --> 00:09:19.739]  And for several minutes, he's behind her while she's playing, rubbing her butt while he whispers God knows what in his ear.
[00:09:19.739 --> 00:09:26.544]  And she begins to cry, still playing the flute.
[00:09:26.544 --> 00:09:30.227]  There are videos of parents pulling their children away from him.
[00:09:30.227 --> 00:09:32.068]  Children recoiling.
[00:09:32.068 --> 00:09:36.111]  Him pulling women down to sit in his lap and then putting his hands on their hips.
[00:09:39.369 --> 00:09:42.110]  It's how you get in a fight with somebody.
[00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:51.612]  I mean, if somebody's been your buddy for 20 years and he pulls your wife down on his lap when he came over for a beer and started patting on her hips, you might say, hey, Bob.
[00:09:51.612 --> 00:09:53.873]  Get a little friendly there.
[00:09:53.873 --> 00:09:56.733]  Get your hands off my wife's ass.
[00:09:56.733 --> 00:09:58.634]  Excuse my French.
[00:09:58.634 --> 00:10:00.294]  That is unless you're swingers.
[00:10:00.294 --> 00:10:01.435]  Then get your wife over here.
[00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:04.315]  You're gonna have to share.
[00:10:04.315 --> 00:10:06.196]  I mean, the point is, is that
[00:10:08.387 --> 00:10:09.547]  This guy's out of control!
[00:10:09.547 --> 00:10:32.796]  And Bernie Sanders comes out, and Bernie Sanders defends him and says it only happened once, because it's on video that this very attractive Hispanic lady of the Democratic Party, running for a higher office, she's been a state rep, he starts grabbing her on the podium and kissing her and whispering in her ear and rubbing under her chin.
[00:10:32.796 --> 00:10:37.458]  I mean, if your wife's not in the mood, if she's not in a good mood,
[00:10:39.383 --> 00:10:43.246]  And you come over and start doing that to your wife, she's like, I'm not in the mood, leave me alone.
[00:10:43.246 --> 00:10:48.089]  I mean, you don't just approach your wife like that.
[00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:55.694]  But, oh, just do it to random women and people's kids.
[00:10:55.694 --> 00:11:05.941]  I mean, if my wife is trying to get groceries out of the car, look, my wife loves me, as always, likes me, and is a very attentive wife and very excited about me, but if she's getting groceries out of the car,
[00:11:06.872 --> 00:11:10.874]  And pulling the baby out of the back and I come over and grab her by the butt, which, you know, I do that kind of stuff.
[00:11:10.874 --> 00:11:12.595]  She's like, hey, knock it off.
[00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:13.396]  I'm busy right now.
[00:11:13.396 --> 00:11:15.517]  It's just not the time for it.
[00:11:15.517 --> 00:11:32.947]  Imagine you're playing the flute or you're up on a stage and Joe Biden comes up behind you and starts rubbing your face and rubbing under your chin and then whispering in your ear and then gets behind you and starts rubbing your butt.
[00:11:32.947 --> 00:11:34.908]  It's all about a power and control thing.
[00:11:36.516 --> 00:11:42.018]  And that you're in this public arena and you don't know what to do.
[00:11:42.018 --> 00:11:50.202]  And then he always walks up behind the children and starts rubbing his hands through their hair.
[00:11:50.202 --> 00:11:54.604]  Very sexually.
[00:11:54.604 --> 00:12:05.289]  Imagine if somebody at a park walked up to your 10-year-old daughter, your 5-year-old daughter, and stood up behind him and then started rubbing his hands on your shoulders and rubbing the hands through the hair.
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:15.409]  I mean, if the kids are running around screaming and yelling in the house like they do sometimes, and my wife's over there chopping up onions, say, for a salad.
[00:12:15.409 --> 00:12:16.530]  She's busy.
[00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:17.291]  She's not in the mode.
[00:12:19.304 --> 00:12:20.145]  Of being approached.
[00:12:20.145 --> 00:12:27.509]  I don't know what it is about your wife in the kitchen or something or doing things, but you know, they're cute, they're doing stuff, you come up behind them and start rubbing on them and kissing on them.
[00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:30.550]  And you know, most of the time she's like, okay, great, let's get in the bedroom in five minutes.
[00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.452]  But most of the time it's like, hey, I'm busy.
[00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:35.333]  It's just not the mode for it.
[00:12:35.333 --> 00:12:42.897]  So again, men don't treat their wives on average the way Biden treats women in public.
[00:12:48.991 --> 00:12:51.612]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:12:51.612 --> 00:12:56.873]  And then again, it's bigger than Biden, the front runner of the Democratic Party right now, almost all polls show.
[00:12:56.873 --> 00:12:59.253]  It's that he gets away with it.
[00:12:59.253 --> 00:13:01.273]  He's been known to do this for decades.
[00:13:01.273 --> 00:13:08.335]  I know the guy who sold them the property, the wooded property right next to their bar.
[00:13:08.335 --> 00:13:13.816]  And he told me some stories, but it just fits in to everything else.
[00:13:18.129 --> 00:13:25.755]  It just fits in to everything we know about this guy and how the Democratic Party is now defending him.
[00:13:25.755 --> 00:13:36.383]  Imagine if we had footage of Kavanaugh walking up to random women on stages and standing behind them and clearly rubbing on their butts and running his hands through their hair.
[00:13:36.383 --> 00:13:41.006]  We'd say, this guy's a creepozoid.
[00:13:41.006 --> 00:13:43.628]  By the way, I would never even think about doing something like this, but
[00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:49.779]  You go up and start touching on people's wives and stuff in public when you know their husbands are in the audience?
[00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:51.240]  It's a good way to get your ass kicked.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:14:00.904]  I mean, let me tell you, if I was sitting there and I was at some public event, I look 20 yards away and a guy's rubbing his hands through my wife's hair and I walk over and say, is this an old boyfriend?
[00:14:00.904 --> 00:14:01.505]  What the hell?
[00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:04.946]  Of course, my wife would be like, what are you doing?
[00:14:04.946 --> 00:14:07.267]  And push the guy away.
[00:14:07.267 --> 00:14:08.808]  That's the normal instinct.
[00:14:08.808 --> 00:14:12.490]  Yeah, there he is rubbing a woman's stomach up to under her breast.
[00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:18.602]  Ugh, so creepy, man.
[00:14:18.602 --> 00:14:20.063]  That's a creepy way he does it.
[00:14:20.063 --> 00:14:23.665]  I mean, I guarantee you, women, even if you were married to him, don't like that.
[00:14:23.665 --> 00:14:26.327]  So I'm going to go over all this and so much more.
[00:14:26.327 --> 00:14:29.409]  The Globals are planning to try to overthrow the President.
[00:14:29.409 --> 00:14:30.270]  We've got their next plan.
[00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.351]  I'm going to exclusively break that down coming up.
[00:14:32.351 --> 00:14:33.852]  Put out a special report last night on it.
[00:14:33.852 --> 00:14:35.753]  It's up there until about 8 o'clock.

[00:14:39.996 --> 00:14:41.037]  And please don't forget,

[00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:50.092]  They try to shut us down, but thanks to you.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.363]  Literally, thanks to you, we're winning the war against the globalists.

[00:17:05.242 --> 00:17:08.284]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:08.284 --> 00:17:14.209]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:17.991]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:19.252]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:19.252 --> 00:17:20.153]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:21.555]  Maybe not today.

[00:18:00.194 --> 00:18:03.777]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.777 --> 00:18:05.559]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:16.828]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.609 --> 00:18:26.796]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.796 --> 00:18:32.561]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.561 --> 00:18:37.845]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.845 --> 00:18:40.087]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.447 --> 00:18:42.168]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.168 --> 00:18:52.175]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:54.817]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.817 --> 00:19:00.060]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.142]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[00:19:02.142 --> 00:19:02.442]  Go ahead.
[00:19:03.084 --> 00:19:04.967]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:08.811]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:10.253]  It just gets old, man.
[00:19:10.253 --> 00:19:12.676]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[00:19:12.676 --> 00:19:14.999]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[00:19:14.999 --> 00:19:19.004]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[00:19:19.004 --> 00:19:21.447]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[00:19:22.308 --> 00:19:24.989]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[00:19:24.989 --> 00:19:26.329]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[00:19:26.329 --> 00:19:27.450]  Us being shut down?
[00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:28.930]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.010]  You know what, Alex?
[00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.111]  Put him on pause again.
[00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:32.211]  Hey, Frank!
[00:19:32.211 --> 00:19:37.873]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[00:19:37.873 --> 00:19:42.374]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[00:19:42.374 --> 00:19:45.515]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[00:19:45.515 --> 00:19:45.995]  You understand?
[00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:47.635]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:47.635 --> 00:19:48.756]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:49.756 --> 00:19:55.340]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars!
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.081]  Do you understand?
[00:19:56.081 --> 00:19:57.722]  I need your help, Frank!
[00:19:57.722 --> 00:20:03.306]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[00:20:03.306 --> 00:20:05.968]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:14.352 --> 00:20:22.357]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:20:22.357 --> 00:20:35.446]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:20:44.292 --> 00:20:45.032]  They're laughing.
[00:20:45.032 --> 00:20:49.833]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:20:49.833 --> 00:21:06.157]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[00:21:06.157 --> 00:21:07.238]  InfoWars.
[00:21:07.238 --> 00:21:08.438]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:21:08.438 --> 00:21:08.718]  Today.
[00:21:15.501 --> 00:21:21.804]  All right, let me tell you some of the big news that's coming up.
[00:21:21.804 --> 00:21:32.349]  And again, I don't like to be gonzo journalism, but it's getting pretty crazy at this point, and I'm not even sure what's going on now.
[00:21:32.349 --> 00:21:44.916]  But Saturday, Beto O'Rourke, Beto O'Rourke's hair really supposed to say it, but I just have fun with it, had rallies in Houston,
[00:21:46.525 --> 00:21:49.706]  In Dallas, El Paso, and a bunch of places.
[00:21:49.706 --> 00:22:00.449]  And then, at 1030 at night, he arrived to downtown Austin in front of the Capitol.
[00:22:00.449 --> 00:22:05.851]  And around the Capitol, there's some parking lots and areas, and it's very, very dark.
[00:22:05.851 --> 00:22:15.194]  And I say that because in the footage we have that we put on Infowars.com, you see some of the crazy leftists, but you can't really see that
[00:22:16.175 --> 00:22:23.121]  Beto is only about 70 yards from where I am standing.
[00:22:23.121 --> 00:22:27.524]  He's probably only got a crowd of about maximum 2,500.
[00:22:27.524 --> 00:22:31.768]  So the media called it 5,000, 10,000.
[00:22:31.768 --> 00:22:43.678]  But I thought I could go with just three security guys and one with Owen separately up to the front, 50 yards away or so, 30 yards away.
[00:22:44.881 --> 00:22:47.124]  We were about 60, 70 yards to the side of the stage.
[00:22:47.124 --> 00:22:49.226]  I thought I could go up into it.
[00:22:49.226 --> 00:22:51.429]  And it was like invasion of the body snatchers.
[00:22:51.429 --> 00:22:55.193]  And we have the audio of this we're gonna be putting out later, but it's so dark in the crowd.
[00:22:55.193 --> 00:22:57.196]  There's so much cussing.
[00:22:57.196 --> 00:22:59.338]  And you hear most of us going, Oh, look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:22:59.338 --> 00:23:00.820]  Look, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.843]  But then there's a platform of media.
[00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.471]  Up above me and they point and they go, it's him!
[00:23:06.471 --> 00:23:06.991]  Get him!
[00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:11.112]  And some of this audio is actually in the two videos they put out.
[00:23:11.112 --> 00:23:13.692]  But it's just crazy.
[00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:15.413]  And then people start going, get him!
[00:23:15.413 --> 00:23:16.273]  Get him!
[00:23:16.273 --> 00:23:17.393]  Get him!
[00:23:17.393 --> 00:23:21.234]  And there's women slapping at the security people and trying to get at me.
[00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:24.335]  So we get out of the crowd.
[00:23:24.335 --> 00:23:27.316]  And we get about 70 yards away to the side.
[00:23:28.834 --> 00:23:33.015]  And then as soon as Beto gets there, I start bullhorning.
[00:23:33.015 --> 00:23:36.417]  Reportedly, you could hear it over him at many points.
[00:23:36.417 --> 00:23:38.097]  It was very effective.
[00:23:38.097 --> 00:23:47.020]  And a couple hundred people rush out of the thousands up to where I am on a little bit of an incline and start trying to physically attack us.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:52.482]  And I mean foaming at the mouth like I had killed their children.
[00:23:52.482 --> 00:23:55.003]  And I'd say, Beto O'Rourke supports killing babies after they're born.
[00:23:55.725 --> 00:24:00.966]  And they would just scream, yes, we love it, we love killing babies, F you, F you.
[00:24:00.966 --> 00:24:07.968]  And just the level of vicious hate was unlike anything I'd ever seen.
[00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:15.690]  And that's before I was ever even bullhorning.
[00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:15.790]  And
[00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:30.500]  Again, my security guys got slapped in the head, they slapped me a few times, and it was hard to get footage of any of it because it was just such a melee, and they'd also come up behind you.
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:39.003]  But we got some of it on tape, but just to know the absolute raw hate.
[00:24:39.003 --> 00:24:42.965]  Like, I used to think it was cheesy when people would chant USA, USA, unless it was the Olympics or something.
[00:24:43.951 --> 00:24:47.935]  Because I get there's a USA version out there that means kind of US Empire launch wars.
[00:24:47.935 --> 00:24:48.935]  I don't like that USA.
[00:24:48.935 --> 00:24:50.897]  I like the real USA.
[00:24:50.897 --> 00:25:02.628]  But I learned in the last few years around leftists, their radicalization under Obama and the universities is so complete that I would say, hey, America's back.
[00:25:02.628 --> 00:25:05.410]  Trump is really getting jobs back.
[00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.751]  And I learned this about two years ago.
[00:25:07.691 --> 00:25:13.392]  When I would go out to Democrat events and they would all go into a rage and start screaming and cussing.
[00:25:13.392 --> 00:25:23.355]  In fact, I could be in front of a moderately normal liberal cloud and I'd be speaking or bullhorning at an event that Hillary was going into or what have you.
[00:25:23.355 --> 00:25:29.216]  But as soon as I'd say, America is back or America is good.
[00:25:30.572 --> 00:25:32.032]  Or, we should all love the country.
[00:25:32.032 --> 00:25:40.575]  That's what makes these people just go... I mean, we're talking about radicalized people.
[00:25:40.575 --> 00:25:46.036]  I don't think the North Koreans, with all their brainwashing, when they protest the U.S.
[00:25:46.036 --> 00:25:46.536]  act like this.
[00:25:46.536 --> 00:25:51.037]  In fact, they don't.
[00:25:51.037 --> 00:25:52.798]  They just go out and march around.
[00:25:52.798 --> 00:25:55.499]  This is beyond 10 minutes of hate in 1984, where
[00:25:58.294 --> 00:26:17.008]  They would flash Emanuel Goldstein, the supposed bad guy, up on the screens at these public events you had to go to every day in these movie theaters, and then you would just scream for 10 minutes going, and I've had five people come up to me
[00:26:18.194 --> 00:26:24.020]  Yesterday and today, when I brought it up at the office, people in the meeting this morning were like, yeah, I saw that too.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.742]  No one watches Spectrum News.
[00:26:25.742 --> 00:26:26.703]  It's Time Warner.
[00:26:26.703 --> 00:26:27.244]  It's CNN.
[00:26:27.244 --> 00:26:28.926]  It used to be called News 8.
[00:26:28.926 --> 00:26:32.189]  In most cities now, they have a local, you know, CNN propaganda news group.
[00:26:32.189 --> 00:26:32.810]  Very low quality.
[00:26:35.012 --> 00:26:39.574]  And I don't watch a lot of TV, but we do have Spectrum.
[00:26:39.574 --> 00:26:43.635]  And I shouldn't have it, but the point is, the house has it.
[00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:53.318]  And I turn it on, and my daughter likes to sometimes watch a movie at like 8 at night, my middle daughter and I. I'll watch cartoons with her, so that's what we do.
[00:26:53.318 --> 00:26:55.799]  And when you turn on the cable, Spectrum's on.
[00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:57.740]  It's the first channel.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.061]  And in the last few months, we've probably only watched TV 10 times, but
[00:27:02.435 --> 00:27:06.097]  Every time I turn it on, I'm like, is that a coincidence?
[00:27:06.097 --> 00:27:09.639]  It's Alex Jones, or I'm on the scroll at the bottom.
[00:27:09.639 --> 00:27:17.063]  So Pat Riley, who works here, he broke his foot a few weeks ago, so his wife and her baby, so they're at home all weekend.
[00:27:17.063 --> 00:27:20.825]  And he said, Alex, I just left it on in the kitchen with the sound off.
[00:27:20.825 --> 00:27:23.207]  You were on three times an hour to four times an hour.
[00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:27.213]  He even taped some of it or DVR'd it.
[00:27:27.213 --> 00:27:28.776]  Folks, I'm on every channel now.
[00:27:28.776 --> 00:27:33.183]  I'm on MSNBC, Every Hour, CNN, everywhere.
[00:27:33.183 --> 00:27:35.927]  And everything they're saying is twisted or lies.
[00:27:35.927 --> 00:27:37.489]  And I don't know what they're building towards.
[00:27:38.444 --> 00:27:41.186]  Because they're almost attacking me as much as Trump now.
[00:27:41.186 --> 00:27:43.587]  It's like they've decided I'm Trump.
[00:27:43.587 --> 00:27:47.129]  And because they can't beat Trump, they think they're going to destroy me.
[00:27:47.129 --> 00:27:48.910]  And it's building towards something bad.
[00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:53.732]  I mean, there's no doubt that everyone's walking up to me going, you're all over TV.
[00:27:53.732 --> 00:27:54.893]  It's like you're on everywhere.
[00:27:54.893 --> 00:27:59.395]  I had people at a restaurant yesterday, at a toy store yesterday.
[00:27:59.395 --> 00:28:01.517]  One of my neighbors this morning came over and talked to me.
[00:28:01.517 --> 00:28:02.637]  Pat brought it up.
[00:28:02.637 --> 00:28:03.698]  People in the meeting brought it up.
[00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:05.958]  It's like, man, you're all over TV.
[00:28:05.958 --> 00:28:11.920]  I was like at a restaurant, and Spectrum's on, and you were on repeatedly.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.642]  Zimmerman saw that.
[00:28:14.642 --> 00:28:17.383]  And it's all bull, too.
[00:28:17.383 --> 00:28:24.906]  Like, we had two lawsuits against me of the 20 or so, now it's down to like six.
[00:28:24.906 --> 00:28:27.548]  We had two lawsuits thrown out last Friday.
[00:28:27.548 --> 00:28:30.089]  It was in local news, and that's it.
[00:28:30.089 --> 00:28:32.530]  But, they advanced some of the Sandy Hook stuff,
[00:28:34.189 --> 00:28:36.790]  It'll take them years, even if they're successful in their fraud.
[00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:38.750]  That is the lawyers, the big backer.
[00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.050]  We now know who the big backer is.
[00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:41.451]  That'll be released soon.
[00:28:41.451 --> 00:28:43.211]  It'll be big news.
[00:28:43.211 --> 00:28:46.932]  And... There was no coverage of us winning those.
[00:28:46.932 --> 00:28:49.212]  But the point is, something big's coming.
[00:28:49.212 --> 00:28:50.213]  And I think I know what it is.
[00:28:50.213 --> 00:28:51.773]  I'm gonna talk about that when we come back.
[00:28:51.773 --> 00:28:54.334]  Then we're gonna get into all the other huge news.
[00:28:54.334 --> 00:28:55.174]  Huge news in Europe.
[00:28:55.174 --> 00:28:55.734]  Please stay with us.
[00:28:59.673 --> 00:29:01.634]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.634 --> 00:29:06.955]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:29:06.955 --> 00:29:08.535]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.535 --> 00:29:16.877]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.877 --> 00:29:22.579]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:24.580]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:26.860]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:31.242]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.242 --> 00:29:33.442]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:29:33.442 --> 00:29:41.285]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:29:41.325 --> 00:29:43.346]  Our grandparents, our great-grandparents, they canned food.
[00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:45.867]  During the fall, so you have it during the winter.
[00:30:06.537 --> 00:30:09.480]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:14.043]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply on the top.
[00:30:15.106 --> 00:30:24.249]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:30:24.249 --> 00:30:29.591]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[00:30:29.591 --> 00:30:31.892]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:35.374]  MFORWARESTORE.COM on MFORWARESELECT storable foods.
[00:30:35.374 --> 00:30:36.874]  They've got special diet foods.
[00:30:36.874 --> 00:30:40.856]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[00:30:40.856 --> 00:30:43.077]  They've got so many great products there.
[00:30:43.077 --> 00:30:44.157]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[00:30:44.617 --> 00:30:46.600]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.144]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:30:49.144 --> 00:30:54.152]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:30:54.152 --> 00:30:59.541]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.302]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[00:31:02.302 --> 00:31:04.043]  There is no set stasis.
[00:31:04.043 --> 00:31:05.284]  There is no managed system.
[00:31:05.284 --> 00:31:06.945]  There is no un-continuum.
[00:31:06.945 --> 00:31:10.167]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:13.529]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[00:31:13.529 --> 00:31:14.750]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.551]  We'll be here forever.
[00:31:15.551 --> 00:31:16.812]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[00:31:16.812 --> 00:31:23.696]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[00:31:23.696 --> 00:31:24.257]  We made it.
[00:31:24.257 --> 00:31:26.438]  And that's really where this goes.
[00:31:26.438 --> 00:31:28.240]  God's got a big war for you, Revy.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:28.600]  And so,
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:35.267]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[00:31:35.267 --> 00:31:40.332]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[00:31:40.332 --> 00:31:43.195]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:45.597]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[00:31:45.597 --> 00:31:49.101]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[00:31:49.101 --> 00:31:50.122]  I want to go to the next level.
[00:31:50.362 --> 00:31:54.646]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:57.528]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[00:31:57.528 --> 00:31:58.609]  I want life!
[00:31:58.609 --> 00:31:59.890]  I want Jesus!
[00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:04.533]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:32:04.533 --> 00:32:08.777]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:32:08.777 --> 00:32:16.723]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:32:16.723 --> 00:32:18.924]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:32:19.825 --> 00:32:27.791]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:29.833]  We are the power structure.
[00:32:29.833 --> 00:32:31.434]  We are the inventors.
[00:32:31.434 --> 00:32:33.216]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:32:33.216 --> 00:32:36.618]  And the globalists understand that.
[00:32:36.618 --> 00:32:43.724]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people.
[00:32:43.724 --> 00:32:47.527]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[00:32:48.573 --> 00:33:02.889]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at importstore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:33:02.889 --> 00:33:05.511]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.576 --> 00:33:27.678]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.678 --> 00:33:28.218]  Alright, so...
[00:33:51.235 --> 00:33:53.136]  Remember, like, last year, Frank called in.
[00:33:53.136 --> 00:33:55.939]  He's since called in and, you know, we've made up.
[00:33:55.939 --> 00:33:58.621]  He said, man, all you ever do is bragging about yourself.
[00:33:58.621 --> 00:34:03.364]  Dude, I'm not bragging about myself.
[00:34:03.364 --> 00:34:05.025]  I do not like the position I'm in.
[00:34:05.025 --> 00:34:06.366]  It's not fun.
[00:34:06.366 --> 00:34:10.650]  But I do like the fact that the globalists are in trouble and their system is being exposed.
[00:34:10.650 --> 00:34:18.015]  When we become one of the main focal news stories by the globalists, they've got a big reason for it.
[00:34:18.015 --> 00:34:20.437]  A big, big, big reason for it.
[00:34:21.963 --> 00:34:24.465]  And I figured out the reason I know the larger plan.
[00:34:24.465 --> 00:34:26.346]  And I now know the timeline.
[00:34:26.346 --> 00:34:29.769]  And now I'm learning who the parties are and the exact players.
[00:34:29.769 --> 00:34:31.811]  And this is how we beat them.
[00:34:31.811 --> 00:34:38.876]  You don't think I'm on every news show every day now for no reason.
[00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:47.983]  They've got a larger plan to destroy me and then tag it onto the Liberty Movement worldwide in some larger defeat.
[00:34:47.983 --> 00:34:50.085]  They are branding me as the villain.
[00:34:52.438 --> 00:34:54.140]  I'm going to say this again.
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:35:03.048]  Three times an hour, 24 hours a day, most days, on Time Warner Cable, now changed their name to Spectrum.
[00:35:03.048 --> 00:35:04.109]  That's the CNN.
[00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:08.534]  CNN runs and controls the station.
[00:35:08.534 --> 00:35:11.136]  They have Smirkonish and all these guys.
[00:35:11.136 --> 00:35:12.738]  People say, well, play the clips.
[00:35:12.738 --> 00:35:14.259]  There's like 10 of them a day.
[00:35:14.259 --> 00:35:15.821]  I can't even spend time watching them.
[00:35:20.578 --> 00:35:23.540]  And they say in the clips, he is a premeditated liar.
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:25.741]  Everything he says is consciously not true.
[00:35:25.741 --> 00:35:27.582]  He is a scam artist.
[00:35:27.582 --> 00:35:32.825]  And of course, everything he's saying is about himself.
[00:35:32.825 --> 00:35:34.065]  They say the same thing about Trump.
[00:35:34.065 --> 00:35:35.046]  Oh, he's a liar.
[00:35:35.046 --> 00:35:37.987]  And they'll show like 20 containers of gumballs.
[00:35:37.987 --> 00:35:45.692]  And they go, every one of these gumballs is a liar, according to PolitiFact.
[00:35:45.692 --> 00:35:48.133]  And then everything they say Trump's lying about is not true.
[00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:54.465]  I've never seen a president deliver this much of what he said he'd do.
[00:35:54.465 --> 00:35:57.787]  People said it's not expedient to go after Obamacare at this point.
[00:35:57.787 --> 00:35:59.809]  The Republicans are like, why are you doing it?
[00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:03.211]  Because it was on the list.
[00:36:03.211 --> 00:36:08.716]  It's the next thing on his list.
[00:36:08.716 --> 00:36:13.019]  And I watch these hit pieces and it's just, it's bizarre how Trump and I are like bound
[00:36:15.592 --> 00:36:16.892]  They even say that.
[00:36:16.892 --> 00:36:20.053]  They say, we're going to get Trump, we're going to get Jones.
[00:36:20.053 --> 00:36:38.198]  And they've basically stolen my identity and created this arch villain that they then are trying to use the captured identity of Alex Jones, this false identity, to project onto everyone else that they want to then demonize and attack.
[00:36:38.198 --> 00:36:43.439]  So I'm being turned into Darth Vader, is the best analogy.
[00:36:43.439 --> 00:36:45.240]  And of course, Trump is Emperor Palpatine.
[00:36:46.937 --> 00:36:49.840]  But that is not what's happening here.
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:58.849]  And then they take the fact that I'm real, and I really tell you what I feel, and I really tell you what I stand for, to make that a weakness.
[00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:02.752]  Here's an example.
[00:37:02.752 --> 00:37:09.179]  You know, with Mr. Frank and others, I've got incredible news here to cover.
[00:37:09.179 --> 00:37:10.320]  I've got big guests coming up.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:19.121]  I was in over, I get the Google alerts, over 500 original news articles that I got alerted to.
[00:37:19.121 --> 00:37:21.822]  Most of them got syndicated in the newspapers and on the television.
[00:37:21.822 --> 00:37:28.923]  I mean, no one I know can turn a TV on or go to a restaurant when I'm not on the television most of the time.
[00:37:28.923 --> 00:37:35.825]  My kids, everywhere they go, they see me.
[00:37:35.825 --> 00:37:36.305]  It's insane.
[00:37:39.838 --> 00:37:42.461]  So, what is the endgame?
[00:37:42.461 --> 00:37:43.402]  Why are they doing this?
[00:37:43.402 --> 00:37:51.229]  They silence me as much as they can so that I can't speak for myself, and then they create this villain that I'm supposedly in.
[00:37:51.229 --> 00:37:56.655]  They don't put out this level of propaganda on something unless they're planning something big.
[00:37:56.655 --> 00:38:00.539]  Remember when they started burning a few Hollywood people with the Me Too movement?
[00:38:02.281 --> 00:38:05.386]  That was because the Democrats knew they had no credibility because of the Clintons.
[00:38:05.386 --> 00:38:11.295]  They thought they would distract by persecuting a few leftists and making them resign.
[00:38:11.295 --> 00:38:12.236]  And most of them deserved it.
[00:38:12.236 --> 00:38:15.201]  But it was still a persecution because it was planned and directed.
[00:38:17.748 --> 00:38:23.810]  Like the stupid former senator from Minnesota.
[00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:27.412]  Because he did a funny photo grabbing a woman's breast and done some jerky stuff.
[00:38:27.412 --> 00:38:34.174]  And he probably should resign, but the point is, according to a Democratic yardstick, he should go to jail, basically.
[00:38:34.174 --> 00:38:46.699]  So they had a few of them fall on their sword to set the precedent to then remove any Republican in the future that even got accused.
[00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:53.748]  And they go, hey, we all resigned, but Kavanaugh didn't, because Kavanaugh didn't do anything.
[00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:54.988]  It was a fraud.
[00:38:54.988 --> 00:38:58.110]  Most women came forward and said they did it for political reasons.
[00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:59.110]  They were proud of themselves.
[00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:00.190]  They said, he's bad.
[00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:08.713]  It's like a lot of folks are defending Smollett, saying, well, you know, they're a bunch of white racists, so we got to stage this to show you how bad it is.
[00:39:08.713 --> 00:39:12.635]  That's why they dropped charges against him, because the prosecutor thinks he's a hero.
[00:39:16.135 --> 00:39:24.017]  And we're just supposed to forget about the Kavanaugh kids, and Balazi Ford, and Smollett, and the fake Russiagate, and all this crap.
[00:39:24.017 --> 00:39:25.358]  And so they need some win.
[00:39:25.358 --> 00:39:30.499]  The Democrats need somebody that's fake, somebody that's bad, somebody that's like them.
[00:39:30.499 --> 00:39:36.281]  And so what they do is, like a sin-eater, they project
[00:39:38.574 --> 00:39:48.482]  All of their sins and all of their tactics and the way they behave and the way they connive and the way they lie on to yours truly.
[00:39:48.482 --> 00:39:50.744]  And it's the only thing they can do.
[00:39:50.744 --> 00:39:52.905]  And they do the same thing on Trump, but it's not working.
[00:39:52.905 --> 00:39:53.406]  So they say...
[00:39:55.751 --> 00:40:01.036]  Jones has helped relaunch the Americana with his audience, a powerful audience that is the heart of this.
[00:40:01.036 --> 00:40:05.260]  Let's take our main enemy that helped get Trump in and then let's turn it against Trump.
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.123]  And let's make Trump in the 2020 election.
[00:40:09.123 --> 00:40:14.688]  That's why they send him all these letters and say denounce Alex Jones, all these Sandy Hook lawyers and all of them.
[00:40:14.688 --> 00:40:19.793]  They create the false trauma and then they want me when Trump denounces me.
[00:40:20.905 --> 00:40:26.688]  They want me to denounce Trump, and they want my audience to denounce Trump.
[00:40:26.688 --> 00:40:29.630]  Well, Trump isn't going to denounce me.
[00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:36.013]  But I tell my audience, if he in some Machiavellian in his wisdom wants to denounce me, denounce away, President.
[00:40:36.013 --> 00:40:37.254]  I'm ready.
[00:40:37.254 --> 00:40:44.458]  I'm playing the part, aren't I, in the real world, because the whole world's a stage of the dark night.
[00:40:46.331 --> 00:40:50.713]  And so if I've got to get the blame for things to save this country, that's fine.
[00:40:50.713 --> 00:40:51.533]  Destroy me.
[00:40:51.533 --> 00:40:58.055]  By the way, I've already told the President that, and the President is not going to go with it, which I don't think he needs to.
[00:40:58.055 --> 00:40:59.176]  I think he's smart.
[00:40:59.176 --> 00:41:04.078]  I've just said I don't blame whoever, whatever happens to happen to me, I'm ready.
[00:41:04.078 --> 00:41:10.080]  I volunteered for this mission, and I'm fully committed to whatever has to happen, and I'm not going to question or doubt anything.
[00:41:11.024 --> 00:41:21.312]  As long as the President's steadfast in saving the country and the border and the Second Amendment and unborn and already born babies, as long as he keeps carrying out his mission, I'm going to carry out my mission and I'm not going to back down.
[00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:25.935]  Because if they think they're going to get me to turn against the President or turn against this country, it's never going to happen.
[00:41:25.935 --> 00:41:30.859]  Now, I've said tongue-in-cheek things like, I love the President, I hate the President.
[00:41:30.859 --> 00:41:35.582]  I don't like being demonized for my support of the President at a visceral, you know, fleshly level.
[00:41:35.582 --> 00:41:36.263]  This is not fun.
[00:41:36.263 --> 00:41:38.645]  But I love the President at a spiritual level.
[00:41:40.205 --> 00:41:43.126]  In the flesh, he just wants to have a good time and be left alone.
[00:41:43.126 --> 00:41:47.148]  Because I'm really a reclusive person in reality.
[00:41:47.148 --> 00:41:49.469]  I don't like President Trump.
[00:41:49.469 --> 00:41:54.611]  Because in the straw man they've built of him, I get demonized by Trump's doppelganger.
[00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:56.372]  But again, that's not the real Trump.
[00:41:56.372 --> 00:41:59.673]  And the Alex Jones you see out there is not the real Alex Jones.
[00:41:59.673 --> 00:42:01.374]  When we come back, I'll play a few of the viral clips.
[00:42:02.737 --> 00:42:08.059]  Some I haven't played yet, a three plus hour deposition that the media misrepresented.
[00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:10.080]  You'll notice most of the headlines use Jones.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.201]  It says he has psychosis and is crazy.
[00:42:14.201 --> 00:42:15.601]  They don't actually show what I said.
[00:42:15.601 --> 00:42:18.102]  That's not what I said.
[00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:26.165]  And when you hear the video or see the video, hear the audio, when I play this on radio and TV, when we come back, they'll go, I've heard Alex say that 50 times.
[00:42:26.165 --> 00:42:27.645]  Exactly.
[00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:28.666]  I was being real with you.
[00:42:29.733 --> 00:42:37.099]  I was really trying to get everybody out there to really be retrospective and look for the truth of what's going on, not one extreme or the other.
[00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:41.243]  And I'll explain that when we come back, what I mean by extreme.
[00:42:41.243 --> 00:42:42.944]  Extremism in defense of liberty is no vice.
[00:42:42.944 --> 00:42:45.727]  It's good to be extremely pro-family, pro-God, pro-self-defense.
[00:42:45.727 --> 00:42:51.111]  What I mean, extreme is, extremely believing everything you're told, or extremely not believing everything you're told.
[00:42:51.111 --> 00:42:53.013]  How do you find that balance?
[00:42:53.013 --> 00:42:55.735]  How do you trust but verify, as old Ronald Reagan said?
[00:42:55.735 --> 00:42:56.496]  Stay with us.

[00:43:16.067 --> 00:43:17.807]  How can I solve that problem?

[00:46:00.305 --> 00:46:08.128]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:46:08.128 --> 00:46:11.450]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:14.551]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:16.112]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:46:16.112 --> 00:46:22.675]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:46:22.675 --> 00:46:25.476]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:29.874]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:46:29.874 --> 00:46:32.794]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:46:32.794 --> 00:46:34.495]  That sends chills up my spine.
[00:46:34.495 --> 00:46:48.037]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:46:48.037 --> 00:46:49.978]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[00:46:50.638 --> 00:46:55.883]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:46:55.883 --> 00:47:03.829]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:06.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:39.301 --> 00:47:40.762]  The globalists are panicking.
[00:47:40.762 --> 00:47:44.264]  Humanity is awake to their technocracy.
[00:47:44.264 --> 00:47:53.391]  But I've now really discovered and researched exactly why I'm being attacked and demonized, second only to President Trump.
[00:47:53.391 --> 00:48:01.136]  They have ratcheted up their demonization ahead of 2020 to make me a symbol of evil and fraud and lies and fake news.
[00:48:02.475 --> 00:48:05.838]  To be a icon so they can support censorship.
[00:48:05.838 --> 00:48:12.945]  And so they can hype their supporters up into a 10 minutes of hate directly from 1984.
[00:48:12.945 --> 00:48:20.152]  And so they can then destroy me and have a fake victory before 2020.
[00:48:20.152 --> 00:48:22.974]  Because they've been unable to take out Trump.
[00:48:22.974 --> 00:48:24.156]  That's why all this is being done.
[00:48:24.156 --> 00:48:26.578]  First I was to be used to hurt Trump in the election, it backfired.
[00:48:28.945 --> 00:48:40.430]  Then our Americana got supercharged because of their attacks and entered the bloodstream of national politics even stronger.
[00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:45.873]  And now they have turned us into the thousand-foot Godzilla.
[00:48:46.735 --> 00:48:48.356]  That they projected onto us before.
[00:48:48.356 --> 00:48:51.297]  Yes, we helped stoke the flames of populism and nationalism.
[00:48:51.297 --> 00:49:00.560]  Yes, our audience was, of all the great organizations and groups, up front with Drudge and only a few others in taking the country back.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.161]  We deserve to be targeted.
[00:49:03.161 --> 00:49:05.081]  We earned this.
[00:49:05.081 --> 00:49:07.562]  This is a sign of our victory, what we asked for.
[00:49:07.562 --> 00:49:08.883]  People always say, take the country back.
[00:49:08.883 --> 00:49:10.863]  Well, do you know what that's going to take?
[00:49:10.863 --> 00:49:11.904]  Sacrifice.
[00:49:11.904 --> 00:49:13.804]  I'm very honored.
[00:49:13.804 --> 00:49:15.365]  But now it's gone into
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:19.542]  Ten times previous attacks?
[00:49:19.542 --> 00:49:23.125]  It's foaming at the mouth, almost every talk station.
[00:49:23.125 --> 00:49:25.988]  Rock and roll stations will break in and say mean things about me.
[00:49:25.988 --> 00:49:29.270]  I'll be listening to XM and they'll just say something horrible about me.
[00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:32.053]  Uh, you tune into Howard Stern, he's saying something horrible.
[00:49:32.053 --> 00:49:34.435]  I mean, it's just the orders have gone out.
[00:49:34.435 --> 00:49:39.999]  This man is the devil and he is to be destroyed.
[00:49:39.999 --> 00:49:43.142]  And if you understand why they're doing it, you understand the key to their larger game plan.
[00:49:48.143 --> 00:49:51.624]  They are making their move.
[00:49:51.624 --> 00:50:00.968]  And then once they've trained their followers to hate me, and once they've radicalized the left even more, they will then turn them loose on everybody else.
[00:50:00.968 --> 00:50:02.189]  That's all.
[00:50:02.189 --> 00:50:06.851]  I'm like a training toy to give them the taste of blood.
[00:50:06.851 --> 00:50:13.413]  And to get them to attack, and to get them into a rage, and then once they've attacked me, and once they've all gone along with lying about me, then it's everybody else.
[00:50:13.413 --> 00:50:14.834]  And here's a few examples.
[00:50:16.007 --> 00:50:19.390]  I've always talked about how this is very important.
[00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:25.175]  On one end of the spectrum, you've got people with mass Stockholm Syndrome who will believe anything corporate media tells them.
[00:50:25.175 --> 00:50:26.976]  We've got all the examples of that.
[00:50:26.976 --> 00:50:28.658]  There's still folks that think Russiagate's real.
[00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.111]  Two-thirds of Democrats do.
[00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:35.312]  And on the other end, you've got people that think this is all a simulation and nothing's real.
[00:50:35.312 --> 00:50:47.957]  In fact, most big computer heads are like that because they're living inside simulation already in a false reality of zeros and ones, a mathematical construction, and so they start projecting it onto the world around them.
[00:50:47.957 --> 00:50:50.698]  When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[00:50:50.698 --> 00:50:54.560]  So you've got folks who believe everything you're told and don't question the universe or anything.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:57.401]  And then you've got people on the other end who think the Earth is flat.
[00:50:58.467 --> 00:51:01.690]  And who think that maybe this is a simulation and nothing's real.
[00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.691]  And they have their right to do that.
[00:51:03.691 --> 00:51:14.260]  But you're going to get more people on the other end of the spectrum not believing anything, science, anything, because they've been lied to so much.
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:19.664]  You know, children that get abused by their parents that get lied to, those are the people that get psychosis.
[00:51:19.664 --> 00:51:25.129]  Really strong psychosis where they don't know what reality is and what it isn't.
[00:51:25.129 --> 00:51:27.891]  And so there's an artificial insanity for everyone.
[00:51:28.746 --> 00:51:33.334]  It's like having your windshield fogged up.
[00:51:33.334 --> 00:51:39.586]  You normally don't have it fogged up, but when there's all these lies, all this propaganda, all the WMDs and...
[00:51:40.738 --> 00:51:46.541]  Babies in incubators and nerve gas attacks that turn out to be ISIS and they said it was Assad.
[00:51:46.541 --> 00:51:51.183]  You start to not know what's real and what isn't because you get lied to so much.
[00:51:51.183 --> 00:51:57.786]  And so it's an artificial, synthetic fog, fog of war that becomes a psychosis.
[00:51:57.786 --> 00:52:05.009]  Because a psychosis is not being able to differentiate reality mentally.
[00:52:05.009 --> 00:52:07.090]  And so I said it was almost a form.
[00:52:09.318 --> 00:52:10.619]  A form of psychosis.
[00:52:10.619 --> 00:52:12.279]  This is my own lay psychology.
[00:52:12.279 --> 00:52:13.140]  I don't have a degree in this.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:15.521]  I'm just a student of the world.
[00:52:15.521 --> 00:52:19.643]  An old school hand of the world.
[00:52:19.643 --> 00:52:22.584]  And he let me drive his truck when he was too drunk to.
[00:52:22.584 --> 00:52:27.726]  And he'd wink and give me money for the girls.
[00:52:27.726 --> 00:52:30.147]  And our lives were like some old western movie.
[00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:33.309]  Sorry, I'm singing a line from The Highwaymen.
[00:52:42.153 --> 00:52:43.875]  I'm digressing.
[00:52:43.875 --> 00:52:46.897]  So, that's how they operate.
[00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:47.958]  And then they take that.
[00:52:47.958 --> 00:52:50.420]  Jones says he has a psychosis.
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:52.322]  Jones says he was crazy when he did this.
[00:52:52.322 --> 00:52:57.946]  No, I was saying, when they lie to you so much about everything else, it's perfectly normal not to believe anything anymore.
[00:52:57.946 --> 00:53:05.173]  But then, when people started thinking that I was Bill Hicks, or Beau Bridges, or Jeff Bridges, and really believe it, what's the frequency, Dan?
[00:53:05.173 --> 00:53:06.374]  Dan, what's the frequency?
[00:53:06.374 --> 00:53:07.715]  Stuff like that happens to you enough.
[00:53:09.741 --> 00:53:17.763]  You start seeing how the system lying so much, and all the confusion, and all the poison, and electromagnetic, and just everything out there.
[00:53:17.763 --> 00:53:20.044]  Mental illness is way up!
[00:53:20.044 --> 00:53:23.404]  Because people don't know what to differentiate anymore, and they crack up!
[00:53:23.404 --> 00:53:33.067]  Kind of like an astronaut, who's super tough and super smart, but 50 days inside a capsule, with weird buzzers going off and stuff, they start going crazy!
[00:53:34.042 --> 00:53:35.443]  Temporary.
[00:53:35.443 --> 00:53:38.185]  Slide into a type of psychosis.
[00:53:38.185 --> 00:53:42.448]  That's a really smart statement, it's true.
[00:53:42.448 --> 00:53:52.415]  In that everything starts looking like a nail because they've lied so much, and then you look at those things, and even though you can't prove it one way or another, there's some anomalies, you go and you say, yeah, it probably is.
[00:53:52.415 --> 00:53:53.076]  I'm proud!
[00:53:54.249 --> 00:53:57.431]  Of the fact that I've always been honest and always questioned and had courage.
[00:53:57.431 --> 00:54:02.735]  But they make that see something evil and then say Jones admits he has a psychosis, which is not what I said.
[00:54:02.735 --> 00:54:04.956]  I said almost a form.
[00:54:04.956 --> 00:54:06.537]  And I described it.
[00:54:06.537 --> 00:54:11.261]  But see, most of these places they tell you Jones admits he's crazy.
[00:54:11.261 --> 00:54:12.942]  They even edit out the almost.
[00:54:12.942 --> 00:54:17.125]  Or they fade the audio down right before so they can put their fraud out and lie to you.
[00:54:17.125 --> 00:54:17.465]  Here it is.
[00:54:20.452 --> 00:54:29.275]  There's a question that I should have asked you today in deposition that I didn't.
[00:54:29.275 --> 00:54:30.815]  That's a good question.
[00:54:30.815 --> 00:54:43.799]  A question you should ask me.
[00:54:43.799 --> 00:54:45.460]  I can't think of anything.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:47.380]  Okay, Mr. Jones.
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.381]  You would agree with me that
[00:54:50.387 --> 00:55:06.799]  When some damage happens, when you break something, when you cause something to be lost, when you hurt somebody, whether it's intentional or whether it's a mistake, there's consequences for that, right?
[00:55:06.799 --> 00:55:09.801]  People should be accountable for the people they hurt.
[00:55:09.801 --> 00:55:15.284]  Objection is to form.
[00:55:15.284 --> 00:55:17.206]  Well, sometimes people claim they've been hurt and they haven't been.
[00:55:19.249 --> 00:55:19.529]  We're good.
[00:55:40.894 --> 00:55:43.855]  Any compass of what's real.
[00:55:43.855 --> 00:55:53.019]  And I myself have almost had a form of psychosis back in the past where I basically thought everything was staged, even though I've now learned a lot of times things aren't staged.
[00:55:53.019 --> 00:56:02.723]  So I think as a pundit and someone giving opinion that my opinions have been wrong, but they were never wrong consciously to hurt people.
[00:56:02.723 --> 00:56:05.164]  And so I think it's part of that process of me growing up.
[00:56:06.404 --> 00:56:10.888]  In Rockwall, Texas, watching the police steal drugs and then conduct anti-drug programs at the school.
[00:56:10.888 --> 00:56:14.370]  I think that shook my opinion of police in general.
[00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:19.074]  And I was very anti-law enforcement until I grew up and learned more things, and now I'm pretty much pro-police.
[00:56:19.074 --> 00:56:22.816]  So it's been a process.
[00:56:22.816 --> 00:56:24.638]  And life is a process.
[00:56:24.638 --> 00:56:27.880]  Oh, Alex, you questioned Sandy Hook when everybody else was questioning it.
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.643]  And then all these liberals at the Beto rally going, hey, I questioned Sandy Hook.
[00:56:31.643 --> 00:56:34.485]  I mean, most people don't buy it, for whatever reason.
[00:56:36.212 --> 00:56:43.193]  And then once you say, okay, I apologize if any of this hurt you, they go, oh, we got you.
[00:56:43.193 --> 00:56:44.514]  Keep apologizing.
[00:56:44.514 --> 00:56:51.355]  And then they turn you into this devil when the New York Times isn't apologizing for lying about WMDs consciously.
[00:56:51.355 --> 00:56:54.915]  CNN doesn't apologize for any of their lies about Russiagate.
[00:56:54.915 --> 00:56:55.516]  None of them do.
[00:56:55.516 --> 00:56:56.676]  They did it on purpose.
[00:56:56.676 --> 00:56:58.636]  They get a memo, they put lies out.
[00:56:58.636 --> 00:57:02.677]  But, oh, the left is all sanctimonious, like that lawyer who's a big leftist sitting there
[00:57:04.551 --> 00:57:06.052]  Aren't you sorry for what you've done?
[00:57:06.052 --> 00:57:08.314]  No, I'm not sorry for what I've done.
[00:57:08.314 --> 00:57:15.059]  I'm sorry if me having to ask these questions hurt people's feelings, and I'm sorry for tragedies, but I didn't kill those children.
[00:57:15.059 --> 00:57:26.187]  But we've had this senator, Murphy, or Murray, whatever the hell his name is, up there in Connecticut, come out and say that I killed this guy that died last week.
[00:57:26.187 --> 00:57:29.490]  He said, I killed him!
[00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:31.031]  The Sandy Hook father, that's outrageous!
[00:57:32.423 --> 00:57:35.425]  He gets to have his platform and say that, but not me.
[00:57:35.425 --> 00:57:38.448]  He just said, I killed that man.
[00:57:38.448 --> 00:57:41.991]  That's okay, because he's an anointed leftist.
[00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:45.934]  He said, the survival of our democracy depends on banning info wars.
[00:57:45.934 --> 00:57:47.635]  The whole system's declared war on me.
[00:57:47.635 --> 00:57:47.916]  Why?

[00:58:53.970 --> 00:58:56.891]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[00:58:56.891 --> 00:58:59.852]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:59.852 --> 00:59:04.434]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of MyPatriot Supply, one of the top

[00:59:53.287 --> 00:59:55.948]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.676 --> 01:00:04.708]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:06.821 --> 01:00:09.322]  Always informative, very smart guy.
[01:00:09.322 --> 01:00:20.688]  We're talking about Alex Jones and the fact of the matter is that the companies that allow people like him, conspiracy theorists, to be able to purvey lies have a responsibility.
[01:00:20.688 --> 01:00:30.813]  There is no constitutional duty on an internet company to allow somebody to terrorize parents of mass tragedies like Alex Jones did for so long.
[01:00:30.813 --> 01:00:35.875]  The Newtown families are proceeding with a court case to try to hold him accountable.
[01:00:36.555 --> 01:00:54.930]  But the companies that allow for this nonsense, this garbage, to be spread out over the internet have a responsibility and a duty themselves to do something earlier than they did in the case of... So, Sandy Hook hasn't been successful in getting the guns.
[01:00:54.930 --> 01:00:55.871]  CNN's complaining.
[01:00:55.871 --> 01:01:00.254]  They're going, man, they took the guns in New Zealand in just a week.
[01:01:00.254 --> 01:01:01.355]  We can't get the guns here.
[01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:03.397]  So it failed to get the Second Amendment.
[01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:09.404]  So they've got to get our First Amendment, and that's what that Senator's doing.
[01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:15.468]  Who, by the way, was heavily involved in his career, sucking off of Sandy Hook to get elected, I've now learned.
[01:01:15.468 --> 01:01:19.471]  You've got Senator Blumenthal's son that works in a law firm that's suing me there.
[01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:22.013]  I mean, this is a Democrat franchise.
[01:01:22.013 --> 01:01:24.414]  They're the ones that live off the deaths of these kids.
[01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:31.559]  They're the ones that obsess over it, and in my name say things I never said, and then beat their chest and call for an end to the First Amendment.
[01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:32.520]  What a group of monsters.
[01:01:33.507 --> 01:01:40.874]  Now the always informative and really smart Bob Barnes, who's fighting all this with us, Chief Legal Counsel, will be joining us the rest of the hour.
[01:01:40.874 --> 01:01:42.956]  We'll cover a waterfront of news.
[01:01:42.956 --> 01:01:46.840]  And then Ben Garrison, who's also being demonized and taken off the internet, he'll be joining us.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.242]  We'll have open phones as well.
[01:01:49.242 --> 01:01:53.186]  And a lot of other world news I haven't hit, we'll cover at the start of the next segment.
[01:01:53.186 --> 01:01:54.287]  But getting back to the deposition.
[01:01:55.615 --> 01:02:10.084]  This is where the Texas lawyer who is just a puppet, I mean he's completely run by the Connecticut law firm and Senator Blumenthal's operation and Chris Murphy's operation, where he, they just go through buzzwords for the media.
[01:02:10.084 --> 01:02:13.586]  I mean all this was was soundbite questions for the media.
[01:02:13.586 --> 01:02:19.689]  And they ask about a big bowl of chili and I'm supposed to answer about a big bowl of chili so then they can make me sound stupid.
[01:02:19.689 --> 01:02:23.712]  And this is the type of just weirdness where these people think getting in the news is cool.
[01:02:24.668 --> 01:02:28.310]  And I mean, it does something in this whole bandwagon.
[01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:31.331]  So here it is.
[01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:33.592]  That's, from my memory, not what happens.
[01:02:33.592 --> 01:02:35.532]  I can't comment on hypotheticals.
[01:02:35.532 --> 01:02:41.795]  Oh, so if I was to say to you, if somebody was to come along and strike your hand with a hammer, would it hurt?
[01:02:41.795 --> 01:02:44.596]  You can't answer that question.
[01:02:44.596 --> 01:02:46.297]  I'm not striking anybody with a hammer, sir.
[01:02:46.297 --> 01:02:50.438]  If I asked you if I gave you a big bowl of chili, might it affect your memory?
[01:02:50.438 --> 01:02:51.259]  You can't answer that.
[01:02:51.259 --> 01:02:53.059]  That's hypothetical.
[01:02:53.059 --> 01:02:54.080]  Correct?
[01:02:55.014 --> 01:03:03.580]  You're just not going to answer those kind of questions.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.881]  I'll take it that's no.
[01:03:04.881 --> 01:03:05.461]  Let's move on.
[01:03:05.461 --> 01:03:07.122]  I'll take it that wasn't a question.
[01:03:07.122 --> 01:03:08.123]  Is that a question?
[01:03:08.123 --> 01:03:08.323]  Is it?
[01:03:08.323 --> 01:03:09.784]  That's not a question.
[01:03:09.784 --> 01:03:11.725]  This is becoming one of the most harassing.
[01:03:11.725 --> 01:03:14.947]  This is for TV and for PR, not for a legitimate suit.
[01:03:14.947 --> 01:03:15.928]  That's what this is.
[01:03:15.928 --> 01:03:16.608]  That's all this is.
[01:03:16.608 --> 01:03:18.209]  You want to put it on TV.
[01:03:18.209 --> 01:03:21.131]  This is just a show and it's a bad show at that.
[01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.774]  It's a show of how not to be a lawyer in deposition of a case show.
[01:03:25.154 --> 01:03:28.135]  I mean, if you want to be fair, and you want to ask real questions, go ahead.
[01:03:28.135 --> 01:03:35.896]  But don't make comments, and then try to reinterpret those comments as a question, and then try to put words in the mouth of the witness.
[01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:40.157]  I mean, first-year law students should know that.
[01:03:40.157 --> 01:03:41.998]  What was your objection?
[01:03:41.998 --> 01:03:51.700]  The objection was to your comment saying that there was an answer, and my point was, you didn't ask a question, so there couldn't have been an answer, and I was objecting for the record purposes that no answer had been given to a question that had not been asked.
[01:03:53.223 --> 01:03:55.766]  Do you maybe want to take a break so we can have a few breaths?
[01:03:55.766 --> 01:03:56.247]  Yeah.
[01:03:56.247 --> 01:03:58.049]  Yeah, you might need to do that.
[01:03:58.049 --> 01:03:59.030]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:59.030 --> 01:04:01.093]  And maybe you can go back and read how to ask people.
[01:04:01.093 --> 01:04:02.235]  Okay.
[01:04:02.235 --> 01:04:08.843]  Then there's this clip at the end where they weren't even supposed to discuss releasing it for 30 days, but it was released in just about two and a half weeks.
[01:04:08.843 --> 01:04:09.384]  Here's that clip.
[01:04:10.353 --> 01:04:12.334]  Please go ahead, Mr. Barnes.
[01:04:12.334 --> 01:04:25.001]  So what we have in the protective order is that for the 30 days following any deposition, the parties must treat all of the deposition testimony and exhibits and other documents produced at any deposition as attorney's eyes only.
[01:04:25.001 --> 01:04:27.303]  And so they're marked confidential until that time.
[01:04:27.303 --> 01:04:27.543]  Thank you.
[01:04:28.963 --> 01:04:32.844]  So no designation of confidentiality has been made today?
[01:04:32.844 --> 01:04:33.244]  Absolutely.
[01:04:33.244 --> 01:04:35.384]  The whole thing is confidential right now?
[01:04:35.384 --> 01:04:37.105]  It's presumed until 30 days.
[01:04:37.105 --> 01:04:39.605]  And we have 30 days to designate confidentiality, right?
[01:04:39.605 --> 01:04:40.145]  Absolutely.
[01:04:40.145 --> 01:04:41.065]  Very well.
[01:04:41.065 --> 01:04:42.586]  That's good.
[01:04:42.586 --> 01:04:46.406]  But, again, when you're Democrats, you can do whatever you want.
[01:04:46.406 --> 01:04:47.106]  Small it.
[01:04:47.106 --> 01:04:48.387]  No charges.
[01:04:48.387 --> 01:04:49.807]  Charges dropped.
[01:04:49.807 --> 01:04:51.727]  Kavanaugh accusers, all fake.
[01:04:51.727 --> 01:04:52.687]  It's okay, though.
[01:04:52.687 --> 01:04:54.388]  Russiagate, all fake.
[01:04:54.388 --> 01:04:55.488]  Huffington kids, all fake.
[01:04:55.488 --> 01:04:55.968]  It's okay.
[01:04:58.402 --> 01:05:03.243]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:05:03.243 --> 01:05:12.705]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:05:12.705 --> 01:05:17.486]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[01:05:17.486 --> 01:05:25.768]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[01:05:25.848 --> 01:05:26.108]  Yes, we are!
[01:05:55.512 --> 01:06:00.436]  We're good to go.
[01:06:18.297 --> 01:06:30.526]  Now that the Mueller investigation is over, many questions are falling upon Adam Schiff and others, who all claimed to have direct knowledge of criminal evidence against President Donald Trump.
[01:06:30.526 --> 01:06:34.930]  I think there's plenty of evidence of collusion or conspiracy in plain sight.
[01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:36.751]  Cold, hard evidence.
[01:06:36.751 --> 01:06:44.617]  Have you seen things on the classified side that you cannot tell us about, though, that is even stronger evidence than what is out there publicly?
[01:06:45.615 --> 01:06:46.676]  Yes.
[01:06:46.676 --> 01:06:50.139]  Some people are saying they are guilty of treason.
[01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:58.506]  But the statute for treason specifies that the person levies war against the United States or adheres to their enemies.
[01:06:58.506 --> 01:07:05.973]  And while we may discover that may be true for some, there is one statute that seems to apply to many.
[01:07:05.973 --> 01:07:11.158]  Enacted in 1940 as the Alien Registration Act, or the Smith Act,
[01:07:12.418 --> 01:07:12.979]  18 U.S.
[01:07:12.979 --> 01:07:18.661]  Code 2385 prescribes advocating the overthrow of the U.S.
[01:07:18.661 --> 01:07:19.902]  government.
[01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:31.408]  The corrupt establishment was not willing to accept an outlier in the White House and began their attempt at overthrowing the president with a FISA warrant based on a fake Russian dossier.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:39.343]  With no evidence of a crime, the FBI was discussing plans for a coup d'etat.
[01:07:39.343 --> 01:07:48.708]  According to court documents, several mainstream media outlets were hired to report on Russian interference as directed.
[01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:56.792]  And the American people, who put their faith in the mainstream media, were manipulated and turned against their lawful elected government.
[01:07:57.897 --> 01:08:00.669]  It all certainly seems to fit 18 U.S.
[01:08:00.669 --> 01:08:00.990]  Code 2385.
[01:08:03.982 --> 01:08:18.933]  Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government of the United States.
[01:08:18.933 --> 01:08:20.134]  Government's gonna kill this guy.
[01:08:20.134 --> 01:08:30.422]  Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates,
[01:08:30.942 --> 01:08:36.747]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[01:08:52.401 --> 01:09:17.573]  Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any such government by force or violence, or becomes or is a member of or affiliates with any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof.
[01:09:18.953 --> 01:09:21.175]  Those found guilty of 18 U.S.
[01:09:21.175 --> 01:09:33.245]  Code 2385 can be imprisoned for up to 20 years, and perhaps further investigations will lead to charges of sedition or even treason.
[01:09:33.245 --> 01:09:36.627]  The righteous heart wants justice to be served.
[01:09:36.627 --> 01:09:41.631]  For where there is no law, there is no freedom.
[01:09:41.631 --> 01:09:44.794]  Reporting for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:10:01.265 --> 01:10:21.515]  Until recently, no mainstream media really got into strategies of the Democrat and Republican parties and who controlled them and what was really going on because both parties were pretty much run by the same groups.
[01:10:21.515 --> 01:10:25.376]  That's Georgetown Political Science head, Carol Quigley, wrote about it.
[01:10:25.376 --> 01:10:26.357]  It's really uncontested.
[01:10:27.259 --> 01:10:33.003]  That for the times of Kennedy on until recently, I mean, they really had a monolithic party.
[01:10:33.003 --> 01:10:37.826]  They fought over power, but they agreed on the agenda.
[01:10:37.826 --> 01:10:49.353]  Thanks to the Internet and shows like this one and Drudge Report and others, but particularly this broadcast in this area, we were able to popularize understanding what was in the academic
[01:10:50.452 --> 01:10:50.812]  I don't know.
[01:11:07.230 --> 01:11:17.118]  So we popularized getting into the guts of this, and now all over the world people are looking at the power behind the throne, they're looking at collusion by parties, and once you do that it's game over.
[01:11:17.118 --> 01:11:26.645]  The system was so arrogant they defeated Barry Goldwater and they'd ignored Ron Paul and they thought they'd contained us, but in the last four or five years it exploded, Donald Trump perfectly.
[01:11:27.935 --> 01:11:32.576]  Man of Destiny rode in on that wave and now the fight is joined.
[01:11:32.576 --> 01:11:36.477]  So, I want to get into the big report we did last night.
[01:11:36.477 --> 01:11:39.318]  It's been confirmed Trump is going to be willing to leave state.
[01:11:39.318 --> 01:11:40.139]  He is intending.
[01:11:40.139 --> 01:11:41.019]  He signaled it.
[01:11:41.019 --> 01:11:42.599]  My intel and sources, it's happening.
[01:11:42.599 --> 01:11:44.220]  We're going to get more into that.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:52.942]  That video is on Infowars.com and we'll show you that video where it's posted so folks that are watching and listening can go find it easily and share it.
[01:11:52.942 --> 01:11:55.023]  It's up in the video carousel up at the top.
[01:11:55.703 --> 01:12:06.309]  But I wanted to ask you, Bob, because you're a smart guy, why you think they've chosen me because now the attacks are ten times what they've ever been.
[01:12:06.309 --> 01:12:07.869]  I mean, it is just insane.
[01:12:07.869 --> 01:12:15.113]  All over TV, local news, all over the country, total lies, twisting everything like I'm a country they're about to invade.
[01:12:15.113 --> 01:12:17.715]  And it's just ramping up, ramping up, ramping up.
[01:12:17.715 --> 01:12:19.876]  It's not just about them trying to win these fake lawsuits.
[01:12:20.476 --> 01:12:27.438]  I believe they have to destroy me to set the precedent to create a symbol of fake news that I'm supposedly the symbol of that demonized devil.
[01:12:27.438 --> 01:12:30.418]  And then with that key, they open every door and shut everyone else down.
[01:12:30.418 --> 01:12:33.239]  They create the 10 minutes of hate using my image.
[01:12:33.239 --> 01:12:38.540]  They steal the victory of our Americana populist movement, our listeners supercharging it, our victory.
[01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:41.061]  They turn a symbol of victory into a symbol of defeat.
[01:12:41.061 --> 01:12:44.541]  They kind of steal the flag and then run and hide it.
[01:12:44.541 --> 01:12:45.702]  And is that true?
[01:12:45.702 --> 01:12:46.642]  And then what else is there?
[01:12:46.642 --> 01:12:47.342]  And then where does it go?
[01:12:47.862 --> 01:12:54.767]  Well, basically they're trying to effectively make it illegal to do anything other than spread institutional narratives.
[01:12:54.767 --> 01:13:06.697]  So if you spread any news that's not the institutional narrative, whether it's big media or the government, then you can be sued into oblivion, you can be blacklisted off of all of social media, and you can be demonized throughout the whole public square.
[01:13:06.697 --> 01:13:12.061]  And that's really the goal and the objective, and it's to use you as the telltale example to achieve that objective.
[01:13:12.581 --> 01:13:16.782]  And the effect of that is basically to destroy the independent free press in the United States.
[01:13:16.782 --> 01:13:25.044]  That if you spread any message, that message has to be institutionally approved, has to be state sanctioned, has to be media approved, big media approved.
[01:13:25.044 --> 01:13:29.265]  And that's why there's double standards in how they're applying the law in a wide range of contexts here.
[01:13:29.265 --> 01:13:34.766]  That's why they're willing to defame you while claiming that there's defamation suits that they can bring against you.
[01:13:34.766 --> 01:13:37.067]  So you're seeing that systematic effort.
[01:13:37.347 --> 01:13:38.848]  And let's explain that and quantify that.
[01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:39.728]  Everything's about symbols.
[01:14:05.996 --> 01:14:20.311]  So the globalists aren't targeting our regular listeners, they're targeting the public that doesn't know who we are yet, so that when they finally do see us, they self-judge and are, quote, inoculated against being converted or radicalized, as the establishment would call it.
[01:14:20.311 --> 01:14:26.298]  But there's something that is targeting our listeners to where they get so sick of us being demonized that they're scared to promote us.
[01:14:27.478 --> 01:14:32.740]  And also, stop defending so then they won't defend the next people that are brought down.
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:33.160]  Precisely.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.121]  It's the same thing that basically Mueller and the Deep State tried to do against Trump.
[01:14:37.121 --> 01:14:51.285]  Tried to get people to be afraid to defend him, afraid to back him up, afraid to support him, afraid to stand up for him, afraid to send him messages, afraid to... Because his real political power, his real power was completely contingent, dependent upon ordinary people giving him that power.
[01:14:51.285 --> 01:14:53.525]  They were the fuel by which he could do something.
[01:14:53.525 --> 01:14:55.466]  Their greatest fear is us communicating with the President.
[01:14:55.666 --> 01:14:56.387]  Precisely.
[01:14:56.387 --> 01:15:09.356]  And by doing so, they need to silence that, they need to control that, they need to coerce people through public shaming and public censorship campaigns to achieve an objective they cannot obtain if people have freedom of press and freedom of speech in the United States.
[01:15:09.356 --> 01:15:12.859]  When we come back, I want to ask you how we counter that, because you're one of the smartest people I know.
[01:15:12.859 --> 01:15:16.462]  And then we're going to shift gears into the video that I just showed earlier.
[01:15:16.462 --> 01:15:17.483]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:15:17.483 --> 01:15:23.888]  I'm going to have its own article posted to the front page so that people can share it, but it's right up there on the top of the carousel.
[01:15:24.488 --> 01:15:25.048]  We're good to go.
[01:15:41.212 --> 01:15:44.836]  Trump plans to prosecute hundreds of deep staters in 2019.
[01:15:44.836 --> 01:15:47.119]  It's got 43,000 views.
[01:15:47.119 --> 01:15:48.341]  It needs a million views.
[01:15:48.341 --> 01:15:50.723]  The Joe Rogan interview I did last week did get a million.
[01:15:50.723 --> 01:15:51.845]  Let's send it to a million.
[01:15:51.845 --> 01:15:52.646]  Only you can do it.
[01:15:52.646 --> 01:15:53.226]  Please.
[01:15:53.226 --> 01:15:55.249]  This is critical intel to bringing down the globalists.
[01:15:57.399 --> 01:15:59.740]  Ew, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:01.221]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[01:16:01.221 --> 01:16:02.542]  PDE stopped eating.
[01:16:02.542 --> 01:16:03.782]  All his hair fell out.
[01:16:03.782 --> 01:16:05.944]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[01:16:05.944 --> 01:16:08.185]  At least $5,000 in that bill.
[01:16:08.185 --> 01:16:10.206]  Creams, antibiotics, sprays.
[01:16:10.206 --> 01:16:11.146]  No results.
[01:16:11.146 --> 01:16:13.648]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.

[01:16:26.692 --> 01:16:28.852]  Dynavite is nutrition.
[01:16:28.852 --> 01:16:30.653]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.

[01:16:39.815 --> 01:16:41.195]  Dynavite's the bomb.
[01:16:41.195 --> 01:16:46.156]  Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs, you know, besides me, of course.

[01:18:48.448 --> 01:18:55.131]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:55.131 --> 01:18:58.353]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[01:18:58.353 --> 01:19:02.515]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship.
[01:19:03.231 --> 01:19:11.755]  And I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[01:19:11.755 --> 01:19:24.100]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:26.041]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[01:19:26.041 --> 01:19:28.702]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[01:19:30.077 --> 01:19:34.399]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:38.661]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[01:19:38.661 --> 01:19:40.942]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:43.263]  This country is in a war!
[01:19:43.263 --> 01:19:53.948]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[01:19:53.948 --> 01:19:57.530]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:18.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:23.963]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.963 --> 01:20:28.326]  So we're breaking down the real agenda, the battle plan.
[01:20:29.389 --> 01:20:43.463]  And the globalists knew that the InfoWars audience, back on election week, we had 87 million different IP addresses watch video, or click on our live stream, or on our YouTube or Facebook.
[01:20:43.463 --> 01:20:45.505]  That was conservative.
[01:20:45.505 --> 01:20:47.507]  Okay?
[01:20:47.507 --> 01:20:48.047]  87 million people.
[01:20:48.047 --> 01:20:49.348]  That's bigger than Super Bowl tune-in.
[01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:52.320]  And they were just like, okay, drop the hammer.
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:54.180]  They were already censoring before, shadow banning.
[01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:56.661]  They just... But that wasn't working.
[01:20:56.661 --> 01:20:59.921]  So they publicly banned us and de-platformed everything.
[01:20:59.921 --> 01:21:01.182]  That didn't work.
[01:21:01.182 --> 01:21:05.363]  And again, they need to destroy us to have that victory over the First Amendment.
[01:21:05.363 --> 01:21:06.943]  So we've been chosen as the champion.
[01:21:06.943 --> 01:21:09.724]  Like in the old days, like El Cid's a true story.
[01:21:09.724 --> 01:21:11.564]  It's a great movie, very accurate.
[01:21:11.564 --> 01:21:14.725]  They would have two champions instead of two kingdoms going to war in ancient Spain.
[01:21:16.212 --> 01:21:18.974]  Uh, they would, uh, pick two champions to kill each other.
[01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:28.340]  And then whoever won, uh, that battle, instead of having 5,000 soldiers die, you only lost, uh, you know, one soldier because they were fighting the Moors.
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:34.624]  And so we couldn't have, they used to have big wars, but all those kingdoms, Spain had like six or seven kingdoms, but after that they couldn't have many more.
[01:21:34.624 --> 01:21:36.846]  And so they want to destroy me.
[01:21:36.846 --> 01:21:38.747]  I've been chosen as the champion.
[01:21:38.747 --> 01:21:40.288]  I'm not saying I'm the champion.
[01:21:40.288 --> 01:21:42.029]  I'm not saying I'm perfect.
[01:21:42.029 --> 01:21:45.672]  They have chosen me as the symbol of Americana for destruction.
[01:21:46.412 --> 01:21:49.233]  And so now we talked about their plan, Bob, and what they're doing.
[01:21:49.233 --> 01:21:51.914]  Now we talk about how do we counter that.
[01:21:51.914 --> 01:22:02.558]  They were unable to destroy Trump, so now they've picked me to destroy as a morale booster and to set the precedent to kill the First Amendment and set the precedent to create the Alex Jones statute.
[01:22:03.058 --> 01:22:03.478]  Precisely.
[01:22:03.478 --> 01:22:12.524]  I mean, the goal and the objective is to demonize you to such a degree that they can demonize your message, and they can demonize your audience, and they can demonize anyone who ever wants to walk into your shoes.
[01:22:12.524 --> 01:22:15.406]  And so that's the continuous pattern that's taking place here.
[01:22:15.406 --> 01:22:22.571]  And it's a PR campaign that was launched in Hollywood with its caricature that it created in the Homeland Show.
[01:22:22.571 --> 01:22:24.392]  Then it's launched by the media and the press.
[01:22:24.392 --> 01:22:30.596]  Then they use the lawsuits for PR purposes rather than for legitimate lawsuit purposes, as is already happening here.
[01:22:30.596 --> 01:22:31.796]  Then on top of that,
[01:22:32.817 --> 01:22:40.819]  The media uses what's happening in the lawsuits to try to create another false narrative and another fake story, to try to further demonize, to further marginalize.
[01:22:40.819 --> 01:22:42.380]  And it actually reflects an old objective.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:23:01.165]  If you go back and study the cultural portrayal of poor whites or African-Americans between 1900 and 1970, you'll see a similar demonization of entire groups of people in the way they're portrayed in books and movies and film, solely to make people afraid of a narrative that's an old Americana narrative, but it's separate and independent from the institutional press.
[01:23:01.645 --> 01:23:05.267]  It's a narrative that challenges and questions the institutional narrative.
[01:23:05.267 --> 01:23:10.271]  It's a narrative that is more foundational and fundamental to American freedoms than the institutional press is.
[01:23:10.271 --> 01:23:13.953]  And because of that, they need to suppress it, they need to censor it, they need to shame it.
[01:23:13.953 --> 01:23:21.798]  And in order to achieve that, you're the one they've chosen to be the target to say, if you do what Alex Jones did, we'll treat you, we'll do what we did to Alex Jones.
[01:23:21.798 --> 01:23:23.099]  That's the goal, that's the objective.
[01:23:23.099 --> 01:23:24.840]  So that's it, it's the Alex Jones treatment?
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:25.721]  Absolutely.
[01:23:25.721 --> 01:23:27.422]  It's to say- It's like when they took William Wallace and
[01:23:30.184 --> 01:23:36.909]  The most powerful form of censorship, as people like on the left, like Noam Chomsky and others have identified, is self-censorship.
[01:23:36.909 --> 01:23:38.871]  But how do you get people to self-censorship?
[01:23:38.871 --> 01:23:44.255]  You get them to believe they're being surveilled all the time, that they can be censored at any time, that they can be shamed for their support at any time.
[01:23:44.255 --> 01:23:44.896]  That's how you do it.
[01:23:44.896 --> 01:23:45.697]  That's how you achieve it.
[01:23:45.697 --> 01:23:47.678]  That's how the objective is accomplished.
[01:23:47.678 --> 01:23:48.819]  And that's what they're trying to do here.
[01:23:48.819 --> 01:23:56.465]  They're trying to terrorize the audience and terrorize future Alex Joneses from ever participating in this thought free press experience.
[01:23:57.726 --> 01:24:02.953]  And on YouTube and Facebook, if you're a quote, conspiracy person, that just means questioning the official narrative.
[01:24:02.953 --> 01:24:05.536]  If you attack me, they allow you to do it.
[01:24:05.536 --> 01:24:06.878]  And so they're monetized.
[01:24:06.878 --> 01:24:11.223]  And so all these people that used to like me, now their business is attacking me.
[01:24:11.223 --> 01:24:12.024]  Hundreds of channels.
[01:24:12.665 --> 01:24:19.231]  Because suddenly they don't get censored and they get monetized and so now all these channels are attack Alex Jones channels.
[01:24:19.231 --> 01:24:23.534]  So they're hitting me from the questioning angle and they're hitting me from the establishment angle.
[01:24:23.534 --> 01:24:26.217]  I've talked to a bunch of family, neighbors, crew here.
[01:24:26.217 --> 01:24:28.539]  They've got Time Warner, changed his name to Spectrum.
[01:24:29.744 --> 01:24:32.287]  And they have local news here run by CNN.
[01:24:32.287 --> 01:24:37.452]  Literally every 15 minutes, there's an attack piece that just re-rolls.
[01:24:37.452 --> 01:24:40.575]  And they even use old footage and go, here's Alex Jones losing in court.
[01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.497]  Here's Alex Jones who says he's crazy.
[01:24:42.497 --> 01:24:44.739]  Here's Alex Jones who's a racist.
[01:24:44.739 --> 01:24:48.022]  Jones is being taken off the internet for being anti-Semitic and it's like 1984.
[01:24:49.744 --> 01:24:50.905]  But really, it's not even me.
[01:24:50.905 --> 01:24:53.367]  It's that tarot card of Alex Jones.
[01:24:53.367 --> 01:24:54.888]  They've just created it.
[01:24:54.888 --> 01:25:04.634]  One of the really astute things you point out, because I've read a lot of history myself and I never get into this enough, is America's real history was way more rich and way more complex.
[01:25:04.634 --> 01:25:07.336]  And any time you talk about real history, they go, oh, you're defending it.
[01:25:07.336 --> 01:25:07.756]  No, no, no.
[01:25:07.756 --> 01:25:08.677]  It was the time they lived.
[01:25:08.677 --> 01:25:10.478]  There were blacks that owned slaves.
[01:25:10.478 --> 01:25:12.780]  There are still slaves in Africa.
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:15.762]  There were all these different forms of systems.
[01:25:15.762 --> 01:25:17.023]  And you talk about how Hollywood
[01:25:18.194 --> 01:25:26.659]  Demonized real American history, where New Yorkers and people still believe anywhere in the South there's KKK running around and burning crosses.
[01:25:26.659 --> 01:25:33.202]  And all of that Hollywood move actually built up the KKK for a while, and now they've again created this whole false narrative where we're all scared of each other.
[01:25:33.422 --> 01:25:38.608]  Absolutely, like you go back and you study American history, they've tried to demonize poor white Southern culture in particular.
[01:25:38.608 --> 01:25:41.852]  People who think that Deliverance is a documentary of the South.
[01:25:41.852 --> 01:25:43.974]  Which was my experience when I was up at Yale.
[01:25:43.974 --> 01:25:48.439]  And the reason that I started to study this phenomenon that happened to both African American culture and poor white culture
[01:25:48.439 --> 01:25:49.079]  We're good to go.
[01:26:15.129 --> 01:26:23.377]  Then after that, and that's why they, what people don't know is that in fact not only do they disfranchise most African Americans in the South, but the institutional powers that be disfranchise most poor whites in the South.
[01:26:23.377 --> 01:26:28.321]  And the robber barons from as you said the 1830s learned to fear populist coalitions.
[01:26:28.321 --> 01:26:28.842]  Precisely.
[01:26:28.842 --> 01:26:34.046]  Everything you hear about anti-racism is actually making people all hate each other so we don't have coalitions.
[01:26:34.046 --> 01:26:34.447]  Exactly.
[01:26:34.447 --> 01:26:39.851]  It's why Black Lives Matter celebrates divisive events rather than events like my case in Milwaukee that brought people together.
[01:26:39.851 --> 01:26:41.473]  Your big case you just won that you can't talk about.
[01:26:41.613 --> 01:26:41.973]  Precisely.
[01:26:41.973 --> 01:26:42.934]  It was a unifying case.
[01:26:42.934 --> 01:26:45.117]  It was a case when people looked at that, they didn't see the color.
[01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:46.358]  They settled in day three of the trial?
[01:26:46.358 --> 01:26:47.259]  That's correct.
[01:26:47.259 --> 01:26:52.985]  And it's a case where the jury and the public didn't see the color of his skin, they saw a human being.
[01:26:52.985 --> 01:26:58.690]  And when you get that achievement, you get cross-racial, biracial, cross-political coalitions that are humanitarian based.
[01:26:58.690 --> 01:26:59.331]  Shared experience.
[01:26:59.571 --> 01:27:00.412]  Absolutely.
[01:27:00.412 --> 01:27:01.834]  And that's real power.
[01:27:01.834 --> 01:27:03.115]  And that's the power they're afraid of.
[01:27:03.115 --> 01:27:04.596]  That's the power they're scared of.
[01:27:04.596 --> 01:27:17.450]  I mean, you're talking about corporate elites and economic elites who are looking at trying to automate large portions of labor and employment, looking at AI as a solution for their future labor needs and other needs, who increasingly don't see human beings as human beings.
[01:27:17.450 --> 01:27:19.152]  That's why they can support wars that drop bombs
[01:27:20.333 --> 01:27:23.354]  Oh, they say, we're replacing you, we're making a post-human era.
[01:27:23.354 --> 01:27:23.734]  Exactly.
[01:27:23.734 --> 01:27:25.214]  They want a drone-driven era.
[01:27:25.214 --> 01:27:31.696]  They want, you know, the idea that drones could drop a bomb and kill a bunch of kids in a school doesn't bother them, they don't blink an eye about it.
[01:27:31.696 --> 01:27:43.298]  So, it's the lack of humanitarianism within key positions of power around the world that is now being threatened by the popular and populist revolutions and rebellions that are taking place, not only across the United States, but across Europe and the world.
[01:27:43.298 --> 01:27:45.299]  And they're afraid of that, need to oppress that and suppress that.
[01:27:45.299 --> 01:27:46.079]  What would you call this?
[01:27:49.241 --> 01:27:59.587]  If they weren't in deep trouble, they wouldn't need to be waging the personal war they're waging against you.
[01:27:59.587 --> 01:28:14.615]  So if they were in fact safely ensconced and felt completely as safe as a baby rocking in their mother's arms, they wouldn't need to be attacking you, demonizing you, constant lawfare waged against you, constant blacklisting on social media against you.
[01:28:14.615 --> 01:28:15.636]  They wouldn't need to do all of that.
[01:28:15.976 --> 01:28:18.697]  They need to do all that because we're in a transitional period.
[01:28:18.697 --> 01:28:21.858]  We're in a period where either the people are going to win or the elites are going to win.
[01:28:21.858 --> 01:28:26.000]  Where the future is either going to be little-D democratic or totally capital-A authoritarian.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.820]  And that's what they know, that's what they recognize.
[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.561]  And to their credit, they realize that they're up against it.
[01:28:30.561 --> 01:28:34.403]  They realize that they're on the cusp of losing the power that they've long sought.
[01:28:34.403 --> 01:28:37.804]  And that's why they're waging a personal war against you and Infowar.
[01:28:37.804 --> 01:28:40.225]  Well, people just heard total Veritas, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:40.225 --> 01:28:41.345]  That's why it's happening.
[01:28:41.345 --> 01:28:43.246]  They looked and said, who's Mr. Anti-Globalist?
[01:28:43.726 --> 01:28:45.827]  They said he's ground zero.
[01:28:45.827 --> 01:28:46.768]  Get him.
[01:28:46.768 --> 01:28:48.089]  That's why your support is so critical.
[01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.430]  We'll be back to look at Trump.
[01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:52.252]  He's set to start the indictments and arrests.
[01:28:52.252 --> 01:28:53.833]  It's really gonna happen, folks.
[01:28:53.833 --> 01:28:54.953]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:57.422 --> 01:28:59.744]  Ew, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:28:59.744 --> 01:29:01.245]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[01:29:01.245 --> 01:29:02.546]  PDE stopped eating.
[01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:03.787]  All his hair fell out.
[01:29:03.787 --> 01:29:05.949]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:07.851]  At least $5,000 in fat bills.
[01:29:07.851 --> 01:29:10.233]  Creams, antibiotics, sprays.
[01:29:10.233 --> 01:29:11.153]  No results.
[01:29:11.153 --> 01:29:13.655]  Everything we tried failed except the DynaVite.
[01:29:13.655 --> 01:29:16.578]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[01:29:16.578 --> 01:29:18.960]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you gotta feed it something healthy.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:19.200]  D-O-M-A-G-E.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:19.900]  She's got life.
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:20.721]  She's got energy.
[01:29:20.721 --> 01:29:23.262]  Dinovite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[01:29:23.262 --> 01:29:24.423]  You know, besides me, of course.
[01:29:46.656 --> 01:29:47.316]  859-428-1000.
[01:29:47.316 --> 01:29:48.056]  859-428-1000.
[01:29:48.056 --> 01:29:51.998]  Dynavite for life.
[01:29:51.998 --> 01:29:58.440]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.361]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:30:01.361 --> 01:30:03.361]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[01:30:03.361 --> 01:30:04.882]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:30:06.258 --> 01:30:09.102]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:30:09.102 --> 01:30:12.686]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:30:12.686 --> 01:30:14.248]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:30:14.248 --> 01:30:20.815]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:23.619]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[01:30:24.673 --> 01:30:28.014]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:30:28.014 --> 01:30:32.635]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.

[01:33:01.127 --> 01:33:15.459]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:15.459 --> 01:33:17.861]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:17.861 --> 01:33:19.162]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.836 --> 01:33:33.097]  Yeah.
[01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:50.067]  Robert Mars is our guest.
[01:33:50.067 --> 01:33:54.389]  We're in the midst of a battle between nation states and capitalist prosperity.
[01:33:54.389 --> 01:34:04.914]  And the globalists who use capitalism, crony capitalism for consolidation of power, are trying to pull up the ladders so that the public don't have a chance to become middle class.
[01:34:04.914 --> 01:34:08.936]  We're watching an attempt at global governance post-human system.
[01:34:08.936 --> 01:34:10.957]  And I'm going to get into Trump's plan.
[01:34:12.429 --> 01:34:17.250]  And his move and the statements he's made that they plan criminal prosecutions against the deep state.
[01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:19.751]  And Trump doesn't just say something and then not attempt it.
[01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:20.851]  And most of the time he succeeds.
[01:34:20.851 --> 01:34:22.651]  So it's not just our sources.
[01:34:22.651 --> 01:34:24.012]  I played a bunch of these clips yesterday.
[01:34:24.012 --> 01:34:34.534]  We did a special report on it that's up on InfoWars.com that Trump is preparing hundreds of indictments in the next year as he prepares to move against the deep state.
[01:34:34.534 --> 01:34:36.575]  We're talking about how Mr.
[01:34:38.557 --> 01:34:45.009]  Trump plans to carry that out, but also how the system plans to strike back.
[01:34:45.009 --> 01:34:46.933]  So we'll get Bob Barnes take on that in a moment.
[01:34:46.933 --> 01:34:47.434]  First off,
[01:34:48.973 --> 01:34:55.958]  Listen, I need the listeners and the viewers that haven't ever gone to mfulworthstore.com to go there.

[01:35:22.036 --> 01:35:25.158]  Now, it was every supplement, but we sold out, now it's five different supplements.
[01:35:26.325 --> 01:35:28.547]  But we've still got our best-selling DNA Force.
[01:35:28.547 --> 01:35:31.109]  Never done 60% off, but we see how great it is.
[01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:32.910]  We've got a bunch of other big discounts.

[01:35:45.279 --> 01:35:46.600]  It's $15.98.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.001]  $15.98.
[01:35:47.001 --> 01:35:48.642]  We've never sold it that low.
[01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:49.623]  And by the way, it's our best seller.
[01:35:49.623 --> 01:35:50.784]  We sell a ton of it.

[01:36:17.665 --> 01:36:20.125]  They make an order, get the order number, and then cancel it.
[01:36:20.125 --> 01:36:23.626]  But I mean, they're just anything they can do to try to stop us.
[01:36:23.626 --> 01:36:25.346]  There's armies of these scum.
[01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:28.487]  So that was at a 98%, and last month it's gone to 92.
[01:36:28.487 --> 01:36:31.047]  So, I mean, they are hitting us and hitting us hard.

[01:36:46.679 --> 01:36:47.500]  I want to expand.
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:49.040]  I want to launch new shows.
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.701]  And I want to take care of the great crew we've got.

[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:22.581]  Save the First Amendment.
[01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:24.702]  Special's got to end in the next few days.
[01:37:24.702 --> 01:37:26.344]  Bob, so you heard my preface there.
[01:37:28.087 --> 01:37:28.948]  Where do you want to take this?
[01:37:28.948 --> 01:37:30.488]  Because you've got a lot of historical knowledge.
[01:37:30.488 --> 01:37:32.689]  You've been to a lot of the high-level lawyer meetings.
[01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:38.953]  You met with some of the top editors in the country recently about their kill shot on me as a kill shot on the free speech.
[01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:40.553]  They don't want to make the kill shot on free speech.
[01:37:40.553 --> 01:37:42.755]  They go, oh, it's the bad guy Alex Jones.
[01:37:42.755 --> 01:37:45.616]  But while we're debating Alex Jones, they take everyone down.
[01:37:45.616 --> 01:37:49.538]  That's why we've got to be defended because we've been picked as the test case.
[01:37:49.538 --> 01:37:50.899]  Moving on from that to Trump.
[01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:59.443]  And what we just talked about, and the video that's on Infowars.com, we'll put on screen so TV viewers and others can go there, find it, and share it.
[01:37:59.443 --> 01:38:04.126]  We had 40 minutes on this commercial free last night, but we're going to recap it now, condensed version.
[01:38:04.126 --> 01:38:05.427]  He says he's going to move.
[01:38:05.427 --> 01:38:07.127]  He always does what he says.
[01:38:07.127 --> 01:38:08.288]  World exclusive.
[01:38:08.288 --> 01:38:11.770]  Trump plans to prosecute hundreds of deep staters in 2019.
[01:38:11.770 --> 01:38:13.711]  A, he says he's doing it.
[01:38:13.711 --> 01:38:14.631]  How do you think he should do it?
[01:38:14.631 --> 01:38:15.332]  What are the pitfalls?
[01:38:15.632 --> 01:38:31.865]  Well, one of the first places that should be a high-priority item are all the people who gave unauthorized access to the NSA databases that allowed all kinds of illicit searches that started happening in late 2015 and didn't get shut down until Rogers shut it down after he was appointed by Trump.
[01:38:31.865 --> 01:38:32.846]  So that needs to happen.
[01:38:32.846 --> 01:38:36.409]  And you look at, like, some... And he came and visited the president and said, this is illegal, sir.
[01:38:36.409 --> 01:38:36.709]  Exactly.
[01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:40.492]  And the FISA court covered its ass and put out a report saying we were given illegal searches.
[01:38:40.492 --> 01:38:41.473]  It's not like this is a secret.
[01:38:41.753 --> 01:38:42.093]  Exactly.
[01:38:42.093 --> 01:38:44.935]  Samantha Powers was doing hundreds of illegal searches.
[01:38:44.935 --> 01:38:47.657]  Susan Rice was doing all kinds of illegal searches.
[01:38:47.657 --> 01:38:50.619]  So these people need to be focused on and they need to be targeted.
[01:38:50.619 --> 01:38:52.480]  They need to be investigated.
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:39:09.591]  And it needs to stop because there needs to be a message that when you have the keys to the most powerful surveillance mechanism the world has ever known, which is the Echelon and other database systems that exist at the National Security Agency, that if they are used for domestic spying and political opposition purposes, heads have to roll.
[01:39:09.591 --> 01:39:10.872]  There have to be consequences.
[01:39:11.052 --> 01:39:12.713]  Because that, I mean, that is technocracy.
[01:39:12.713 --> 01:39:13.773]  That is total control.
[01:39:13.773 --> 01:39:14.653]  Look at China.
[01:39:14.653 --> 01:39:15.253]  No escape.
[01:39:15.253 --> 01:39:18.895]  Chinese VIP jail puts AI monitors in every cell.
[01:39:18.895 --> 01:39:19.335]  Exactly.
[01:39:19.335 --> 01:39:25.137]  I mean, the Chinese are, the, basically what was happening was Obama was using a Chinese model on U.S.
[01:39:25.137 --> 01:39:25.957]  American politics.
[01:39:26.277 --> 01:39:35.960]  It was the first time mass-scale, wholesale, illicit investigations of people without them knowing it, without their knowledge, and sharing it widespread.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:38.061]  That's one of the reasons why he should pardon General Flynn.
[01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:51.046]  He should pardon General Flynn and say this is the product of illicit surveillance by people like Sally Yates, by people like Samantha Powers, by people like Susan Rice, and get involved and use it as an opportunity to make sure it can never happen again.
[01:39:51.046 --> 01:39:55.127]  It's not only about the President getting remedy against those people who have illicitly harmed him.
[01:39:55.467 --> 01:39:57.528]  It's about stopping this from reoccurring ever again.
[01:39:57.528 --> 01:40:01.749]  There needs to be a message that, hey, if you do this, you're going to face real consequences.
[01:40:01.749 --> 01:40:04.189]  And you're going to face consequences worse than Paul Manafort.
[01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:05.650]  And Paul Manafort's being put on trial.
[01:40:05.650 --> 01:40:06.570]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:07.590]  And that's what needs to happen.
[01:40:07.590 --> 01:40:12.131]  If Paul Manafort is the only guy that's harshly punished in all of this, then the wrong message has been sent.
[01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:22.914]  Well, when you use the NSA to bring in a pro-Chicom global government and implode our borders, that is the definition of using the military power and might, and that's what the NSA is, to overthrow your country.
[01:40:22.914 --> 01:40:23.654]  It is high treason.
[01:40:23.994 --> 01:40:24.755]  Absolutely.
[01:40:24.755 --> 01:40:26.116]  It's what led to the Church Committee.
[01:40:26.116 --> 01:40:34.345]  Senator Frank Church from Idaho was the first person domestically and illicitly spied upon by the original National Security Agency in the late 1960s.
[01:40:34.345 --> 01:40:38.730]  So after Watergate, he used it as his opportunity to go after them, to expose them to the world.
[01:40:38.730 --> 01:40:41.973]  That's how we found out about the horrible things our government, our own government...
[01:40:42.914 --> 01:40:52.604]  MKUltra, Tuskegee, doing a nuclear test and not telling people that there's problems with it by encouraging them to do picnics and watch it.
[01:40:52.604 --> 01:40:54.006]  I mean, there's still old photos.
[01:40:54.006 --> 01:40:56.348]  By the way, it turned out a lot more just came out.
[01:40:56.348 --> 01:41:03.936]  They only gave them the least worst stuff, but they knew they were whistleblowers, so they gave them basically some of the files of each project, but something like 95% never got turned over.
[01:41:05.117 --> 01:41:05.617]  Absolutely.
[01:41:05.617 --> 01:41:07.358]  And it's become systematic.
[01:41:07.358 --> 01:41:12.840]  So, I mean, Duke University today had to pay a $100 million fine for faking environmental research on U.S.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.000]  government grants.
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.042]  And another whistleblower report that came out.
[01:41:17.042 --> 01:41:23.104]  So that kind of problematic behavior at the very top with the most powerful law enforcement and intelligence operation in the world
[01:41:23.484 --> 01:41:32.007]  Misused our Five Eyes relationships because they were using Australian and US sources and UK sources to illicitly spy on the President and his allies.
[01:41:32.007 --> 01:41:37.069]  There has to be consequences for that because if there are not consequences for that, they will do it again and they will do it on a broader and wider scale.
[01:41:37.069 --> 01:41:49.474]  Absolutely, that is true election meddling and now letting big tech that's bigger than the NSA in many ways operate wildly and then Trump letting the EU and others with fines basically tacitly take control of internet regulation.
[01:41:49.474 --> 01:41:53.096]  Trump must come in with prohibitive legislation to free the internet.
[01:41:53.476 --> 01:42:00.183]  Absolutely, because one of the great secrets is that the degree to which big tech is deeply in bed with the deep state.
[01:42:00.183 --> 01:42:06.930]  So Google, Facebook, all the social media giants, use their algorithms, use the data that they're gathering on individuals.
[01:42:06.930 --> 01:42:16.259]  They're taking direction from the Obama Stay Behind Network, and we come back, I'm going to show you exclusive proof of who's behind the lawsuits against us in Connecticut, who's actually directing it for the CIA.
[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:17.421]  Precisely.
[01:42:17.421 --> 01:42:35.243]  So what you have is you have people who are propagating, who are lead propagandists for suppressing speech in this country, for illicit surveillance in this country, who are pushing the attempted deep state coup against the president, who are also deeply invested and deeply involved, directly or indirectly, in the lawfare and the political warfare they're waging against you.
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:40.742]  We're going to show you the breakaway rogue group inside the government.
[01:42:40.742 --> 01:42:42.483]  They, oh, they're so scared of this.
[01:42:42.483 --> 01:42:45.364]  Chris Murphy is so scared of us right now that we put this out.
[01:42:45.364 --> 01:42:46.285]  That's why they want us off air.
[01:42:46.285 --> 01:42:54.489]  That's why they demanded de-platforming because there's an illegal breakaway group still operating against America run by Senator Chris Murphy.
[01:42:57.355 --> 01:42:57.855]  It's simple.
[01:42:57.855 --> 01:43:03.980]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:06.441]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:43:06.441 --> 01:43:10.104]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late-term abortion and all great it is.
[01:43:10.104 --> 01:43:12.846]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:43:12.846 --> 01:43:13.946]  What is the top tumor?
[01:43:13.946 --> 01:43:16.088]  It's the bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:43:16.088 --> 01:43:18.009]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:43:18.109 --> 01:43:19.170]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:43:19.170 --> 01:43:21.111]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:43:21.111 --> 01:43:24.834]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:43:24.834 --> 01:43:27.876]  I'm like, uh, what's the hottest you could do a month later?
[01:43:27.876 --> 01:43:28.137]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[01:43:28.137 --> 01:43:29.578]  No one's ever done that.
[01:43:29.578 --> 01:43:31.499]  I said, how much does that cost a bottle?
[01:43:31.499 --> 01:43:32.440]  It costs $10.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.961]  No one's ever done that.
[01:43:33.961 --> 01:43:36.663]  Sir, the average competitor is 3 to 5%.
[01:43:36.663 --> 01:43:37.464]  The top brand's 50%.
[01:43:37.464 --> 01:43:39.345]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:43:40.626 --> 01:43:43.549]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive?
[01:43:43.549 --> 01:43:44.150]  Our fish oil.
[01:43:44.150 --> 01:43:46.692]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:43:46.692 --> 01:43:47.774]  My children take it.
[01:43:47.774 --> 01:43:52.098]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:43:52.098 --> 01:43:55.101]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:43:55.101 --> 01:43:55.422]  Never!
[01:43:57.071 --> 01:44:02.153]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.

[01:46:54.648 --> 01:46:57.369]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[01:47:00.701 --> 01:47:03.312]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:37.856 --> 01:47:39.178]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:47:39.178 --> 01:47:40.440]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.643]  Attorney Robert Barnes is here with us in the studio.
[01:47:42.643 --> 01:47:47.830]  Famous, successful First Amendment civil rights lawyer, major litigator, just won a big case, one of the biggest in U.S.
[01:47:47.830 --> 01:47:51.515]  history for civil rights in Milwaukee last week.
[01:47:53.752 --> 01:48:06.882]  We know that Senator Chris Murphy, out of Connecticut, is one of the key authors of the different bills that were attached to the Defense Authorization Act a few years ago.
[01:48:06.882 --> 01:48:14.008]  He's now reintroduced these as well, and it is a breakaway group in the CIA and the Defense Department.
[01:48:15.014 --> 01:48:21.900]  But then interfaces with mainstream news, CNN, MSNBC, to try to overthrow Trump and shut down free press in this country.
[01:48:21.900 --> 01:48:23.842]  They've had the hearings, they've broken it all down.
[01:48:23.842 --> 01:48:25.083]  Document Cam, shot please.
[01:48:25.083 --> 01:48:30.709]  Remember this, Obama quietly signs the Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act into law.
[01:48:31.613 --> 01:48:39.522]  Then they just call everyone Russians, who's domestic, and then they're able to use this money to fund hit pieces, lawsuits, and programs to de-platform folks.
[01:48:39.522 --> 01:48:41.244]  That's now come out.
[01:48:41.244 --> 01:48:45.630]  Murphy, Portman introduced measure to fight propaganda and disinformation.
[01:48:47.389 --> 01:48:50.011]  And so they already passed it in 2016, as you can see here.
[01:48:50.011 --> 01:48:52.473]  This is from his senate.gov website.
[01:48:52.473 --> 01:48:54.554]  This is directly from the senator.
[01:48:54.554 --> 01:49:02.200]  He tells you that he did this before, had to put the Defense Authorization Act, and then Obama signed executive orders as well.
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:04.162]  And these are groups of Democrats in the government.
[01:49:05.216 --> 01:49:09.618]  With national security clearances, working against yours truly, President Trump and others.
[01:49:09.618 --> 01:49:19.501]  And he was just on television last week saying, I killed one of the fathers of one of the Sandy Hook victims because I'm quote terrorizing them and I need to be taken off the air.
[01:49:19.501 --> 01:49:24.903]  Then it's quote the democratic, democracy depends on Alex Jones and others being taken off.
[01:49:24.903 --> 01:49:27.964]  And he blamed Google and Facebook and YouTube.
[01:49:27.964 --> 01:49:30.785]  So they're trying to bully them under his control.
[01:49:31.565 --> 01:49:35.386]  And Trump's sitting on the sidelines while this happens saying, we're not going to regulate.
[01:49:35.386 --> 01:49:43.567]  Well, you've let the Democrats then, by the vacuum, and the EU, and all of them come in with the regulation.
[01:49:43.567 --> 01:49:46.148]  And now you see Zuckerberg saying, yeah, go ahead and regulate me.
[01:49:46.148 --> 01:49:49.368]  That's because they'll have protection of law to censor.
[01:49:49.368 --> 01:49:52.209]  So I'm going to explain that again.
[01:49:52.209 --> 01:49:56.810]  Trump's done a great job on so many fronts, but this is his only big failure, is not fighting the censorship.
[01:49:56.810 --> 01:49:57.290]  He started.
[01:49:58.946 --> 01:50:05.296]  A few weeks ago, with the move to strip the money of public universities that engage in this malice brainwashing.
[01:50:05.296 --> 01:50:07.038]  They're now centers of anti-free speech.
[01:50:07.038 --> 01:50:07.940]  That's good.
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:10.664]  But first, Mr. Barnes, looking at this,
[01:50:12.328 --> 01:50:20.276]  And the magnitude of it, and that he's at the heart of quarterbacking all this, and he wants me off the air, and then getting into what you think Trump should do.
[01:50:20.276 --> 01:50:20.736]  Absolutely.
[01:50:20.736 --> 01:50:37.232]  So, I mean, it's part of a coordinated campaign, and the fact that Senator Murphy's on both sides of these, that he's out there promoting a message about the lawsuits, that propagandizes his reason to censor, shame, and control what people can say, what people can hear, what people can speak, what people can think.
[01:50:37.452 --> 01:50:39.714]  And he's the one constantly bringing up Sandy Hook, not me.
[01:50:39.714 --> 01:50:40.514]  Absolutely.
[01:50:40.514 --> 01:50:51.061]  So he's using it as his political excuse, his political premise, his political predicate, in order to engage in the thought control, speech control, and press control that he wants to have happen.
[01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:58.526]  And it's part of an ongoing campaign where they recognize that if people are allowed to get free press, get independent press, get independent... He'll lose.
[01:50:58.526 --> 01:50:59.307]  Precisely.
[01:50:59.307 --> 01:51:01.308]  They can't win in an open debate.
[01:51:01.308 --> 01:51:02.429]  That's what the real admission is.
[01:51:02.429 --> 01:51:07.092]  I mean, the reason why we have free speech and free press both together in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.
[01:51:07.532 --> 01:51:16.976]  Is because it's the independent free press and the independent free speech of ordinary people and everyday people across the world that ends up getting us to the best place to protect our freedoms and our liberties.
[01:51:16.976 --> 01:51:27.701]  That respects the audience, that respects people to make up their own mind, and that respects the power of the idea to be successful, not rely on the power of the person who controls the microphone to be successful.
[01:51:28.061 --> 01:51:38.329]  And so what he believes, and what Senator Murphy believes, and a lot of these other Democratic politicians believe, and Big Tech believes, is that the great danger to America is freedom of thought, is freedom of speech, is freedom of press.
[01:51:38.329 --> 01:51:45.575]  There's a reason why it's in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, because it was necessary to secure every other liberty, is independent free press.
[01:51:45.575 --> 01:51:50.999]  Not the big press, the little press, the everyday press, the independent press, that is critical and essential and fundamental.
[01:51:50.999 --> 01:51:54.441]  And that's getting into the First Amendment, I want you to get back into that, you're an expert in, but specifically
[01:51:55.362 --> 01:51:58.345]  One of Trump's main failings is he can't get people appointed.
[01:51:58.345 --> 01:51:59.786]  He can't get into the bureaucracy.
[01:51:59.786 --> 01:52:00.947]  He's starting to.
[01:52:00.947 --> 01:52:06.912]  The first thing he needs to do, this is who captains and runs the censorship, is this stay-behind group.
[01:52:06.912 --> 01:52:13.157]  And one of the few areas a commander-in-chief can actually reverse congressional funding is how it's designated.
[01:52:13.157 --> 01:52:20.303]  He should take the money out of this group and put it towards the wall or put it towards amputees or something or bonuses for the troops, not billions of dollars.
[01:52:20.303 --> 01:52:24.146]  So we're $2 billion total now to finance the destruction of the press.
[01:52:24.486 --> 01:52:25.506]  Absolutely.
[01:52:25.506 --> 01:52:37.529]  It's deeply ironic that the very people who supported the seditious activity of the Deep State against the President are now trying to reclassify and redefine opposition to the institutional press and institutional power as itself seditious.
[01:52:37.529 --> 01:52:40.690]  And he shouldn't be any part of supporting it, any part of subsidizing it.
[01:52:40.690 --> 01:52:41.790]  He should defang it.
[01:52:41.790 --> 01:52:42.831]  He should demonetize it.
[01:52:42.831 --> 01:52:45.011]  He should do what YouTube has done to everybody who was in the past.
[01:52:45.011 --> 01:52:47.472]  We have found the reactor shaft on the Death Star.
[01:52:48.547 --> 01:52:50.689]  I mean, this takes them out.
[01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:51.430]  Oh, precisely.
[01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:56.775]  This is their last gasp at social control, at media control, at thought control, and at press control.
[01:52:56.775 --> 01:53:03.302]  They're using state tools and state organs to achieve it and to attain it, and the president needs to take action to make sure it doesn't happen.
[01:53:03.302 --> 01:53:05.264]  I mean, we have a CIA body.
[01:53:05.264 --> 01:53:06.646]  This is back to Frank Church.
[01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:08.407]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:53:08.407 --> 01:53:11.731]  In fact, were you guys able to grab the trailer for Enemy of the State, like I was asking?
[01:53:14.246 --> 01:53:14.706]  We have it.
[01:53:14.706 --> 01:53:17.088]  I mean, this is Gene Hackman and Will Smith.
[01:53:17.088 --> 01:53:17.748]  Great movie.
[01:53:17.748 --> 01:53:19.749]  Gene Hackman's probably my favorite actor.
[01:53:19.749 --> 01:53:20.350]  So classy.
[01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:22.491]  Wish he wouldn't retire, but I understand.
[01:53:22.491 --> 01:53:24.092]  And so it's like a Hollywood.
[01:53:24.092 --> 01:53:26.393]  It looks like a North Carolina or something on a ranch.
[01:53:26.393 --> 01:53:29.475]  But this is based on how real stuff works with the deep state.
[01:53:29.475 --> 01:53:32.277]  A breakaway group inside the NSA.
[01:53:33.482 --> 01:53:38.544]  He's using their power to try to bring in a police state for the globalists.
[01:53:38.544 --> 01:53:39.425]  Again, the police aren't bad.
[01:53:39.425 --> 01:53:40.305]  It's the police state.
[01:53:40.305 --> 01:53:41.886]  It means bad guys in control.
[01:53:41.886 --> 01:53:42.766]  Things like this.
[01:53:42.766 --> 01:53:44.287]  This is a police state.
[01:53:44.287 --> 01:53:46.728]  And they discovered that they're killing people.
[01:53:46.728 --> 01:53:51.910]  They discovered they've killed a senator who's trying to stop them from the illegal spying.
[01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:54.331]  And this is actually how the real world works.
[01:53:54.331 --> 01:53:57.273]  And Chris Murphy is the bad guy in this movie.
[01:53:57.273 --> 01:53:58.873]  He's one of the kingpins.
[01:53:58.873 --> 01:54:00.794]  It's just outrageously criminal.
[01:54:00.794 --> 01:54:02.075]  Let's go ahead and roll that trailer, please.
[01:54:07.402 --> 01:54:10.845]  Hey, hi, so you want some lingerie for your wife?
[01:54:10.845 --> 01:54:16.630]  Yes I'm not really Experienced in this I mean don't get me wrong.
[01:54:16.630 --> 01:54:18.071]  I mean I'm experienced.
[01:54:18.071 --> 01:54:19.792]  You know I don't want to come in here and look stupid
[01:54:23.882 --> 01:54:26.003]  I should have gotten her a watch.
[01:54:26.003 --> 01:54:28.864]  Robert Clayton Dean was innocent.
[01:54:28.864 --> 01:54:29.404]  Freeze there.
[01:54:29.404 --> 01:54:30.725]  Arms ten.
[01:54:30.725 --> 01:54:34.866]  We have reason to believe that Mr. Zavitz may have passed sensitive materials to you.
[01:54:34.866 --> 01:54:35.887]  What kind of materials?
[01:54:35.887 --> 01:54:36.667]  Sensitive soap.
[01:54:36.667 --> 01:54:38.848]  Let's get into his life.
[01:54:38.848 --> 01:54:40.849]  Have you bugged it, Mr. Dean?
[01:54:40.849 --> 01:54:42.249]  Move to audio three.
[01:54:42.249 --> 01:54:43.570]  He was unsuspecting.
[01:54:43.570 --> 01:54:43.990]  Hey, hey!
[01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:45.991]  Am I in the wrong house?
[01:54:45.991 --> 01:54:46.831]  Hello?
[01:54:46.831 --> 01:54:48.752]  Eric?
[01:54:48.752 --> 01:54:49.032]  Mr. Dean!
[01:54:49.592 --> 01:54:50.753]  He was unaware.
[01:54:50.753 --> 01:54:53.275]  You are the only woman in the world for me.
[01:54:53.275 --> 01:54:56.918]  You and Janet Jackson.
[01:54:56.918 --> 01:55:00.221]  Now, what he doesn't know... I'd like to report a break-in.
[01:55:00.221 --> 01:55:01.322]  ...could kill him.
[01:55:01.322 --> 01:55:04.925]  Request immediate keyhole visual tasking, maximum resolution.
[01:55:04.925 --> 01:55:06.186]  He's on your six o'clock!
[01:55:06.186 --> 01:55:07.447]  You have something they want!
[01:55:07.447 --> 01:55:08.208]  Two targets rooftop.
[01:55:08.208 --> 01:55:09.189]  I don't have anything!
[01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:11.431]  Maybe you do and you don't know it!
[01:55:11.431 --> 01:55:12.311]  You're a threat now.
[01:55:12.311 --> 01:55:12.992]  To whom?
[01:55:12.992 --> 01:55:13.653]  Everyone you know.
[01:55:13.653 --> 01:55:14.533]  Target's on the move.
[01:55:14.533 --> 01:55:14.914]  A name?
[01:55:14.914 --> 01:55:15.394]  A phone number?
[01:55:15.394 --> 01:55:16.075]  No, nothing!
[01:55:16.075 --> 01:55:17.055]  He didn't give me anything!
[01:55:19.770 --> 01:55:23.614]  Do you know how many federal agents you have following you?
[01:55:23.614 --> 01:55:24.795]  Stay exactly where you are.
[01:55:24.795 --> 01:55:27.738]  We're gonna use every means possible to get what we need.
[01:55:27.738 --> 01:55:28.919]  From Jerry Bruckheimer.
[01:55:28.919 --> 01:55:29.519]  Get the cat.
[01:55:29.519 --> 01:55:30.901]  What's the cat's name?
[01:55:30.901 --> 01:55:31.041]  Babe!
[01:55:31.041 --> 01:55:31.962]  Producer of The Rock.
[01:55:33.211 --> 01:55:34.171]  Come here, baby.
[01:55:34.171 --> 01:55:35.012]  Baby, come, come.
[01:55:35.012 --> 01:55:35.572]  Come here!
[01:55:35.572 --> 01:55:37.112]  A film by Tony Scott.
[01:55:37.112 --> 01:55:38.453]  Target is on 21.
[01:55:38.453 --> 01:55:39.813]  Director of Crimson Tide.
[01:55:39.813 --> 01:55:40.513]  Is this about me?
[01:55:40.513 --> 01:55:40.573]  20.
[01:55:40.573 --> 01:55:42.434]  Do they know me?
[01:55:42.434 --> 01:55:43.414]  19.
[01:55:43.414 --> 01:55:44.015]  Who is that?
[01:55:44.015 --> 01:55:44.115]  18.
[01:55:44.115 --> 01:55:45.795]  He jumped to 17.
[01:55:45.795 --> 01:55:47.236]  Do they know me?
[01:55:47.236 --> 01:55:50.177]  I don't know what you're talking about!
[01:55:50.177 --> 01:55:50.897]  Will Smith.
[01:55:50.897 --> 01:55:52.357]  You're one of them, aren't you?
[01:55:52.357 --> 01:55:53.218]  Former conspirer.
[01:55:53.218 --> 01:55:55.819]  Swing it, Target, swing it!
[01:55:55.819 --> 01:55:56.579]  Gene Hackman.
[01:55:56.579 --> 01:55:58.099]  This man, this is our problem.
[01:55:58.099 --> 01:55:59.880]  You live another day, I'll be very impressed.
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:02.901]  It's not paranoia when they're really after you.
[01:56:05.111 --> 01:56:08.337]  Stop it now!
[01:56:08.337 --> 01:56:09.980]  Enemy of the State.
[01:56:11.610 --> 01:56:15.052]  A rogue criminal group trying to take the government over.
[01:56:15.052 --> 01:56:16.833]  That's what always happens in terrible countries.
[01:56:16.833 --> 01:56:17.893]  Now it's happening here.
[01:56:17.893 --> 01:56:18.894]  They've been caught.
[01:56:18.894 --> 01:56:20.055]  The President's talking about it.
[01:56:20.055 --> 01:56:21.596]  He's getting ready to prosecute them.
[01:56:21.596 --> 01:56:23.897]  Move against Chris Murphy now!
[01:56:23.897 --> 01:56:25.698]  Move against Blumenthal and his son!
[01:56:25.698 --> 01:56:26.318]  All of them!
[01:56:26.318 --> 01:56:28.179]  Protect the American people, President!
[01:56:28.179 --> 01:56:30.180]  Our intelligence agencies are good people!
[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:33.842]  These are enemies working with the CHICOMS, and that's why they want me off air!
[01:56:33.842 --> 01:56:35.743]  They're working for the CHICOMS, dammit!
[01:56:35.743 --> 01:56:37.904]  Now protect us from these assholes!
[01:56:37.904 --> 01:56:38.485]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:56:39.165 --> 01:57:02.988]  I mean, basically it's a sort of continuous coordinated effort to control thought, speech and freedom in the United States because of the success of the independent free press, because of the success of people's independent activities politically, because of their empowering the President of the United States to reverse this Chinese model of economic and political control that the big tech is colluding with the Chinese companies to accomplish and achieve.
[01:57:03.348 --> 01:57:08.035]  And they want to do it here because we are still the source of American freedom and the world's freedom.
[01:57:08.035 --> 01:57:10.538]  We are that beacon of liberty to the rest of the world.
[01:57:10.538 --> 01:57:16.847]  And so if they could reverse, the fact they could achieve it in China is no surprise that that's the nature of the Chinese government, Chinese society.
[01:57:16.847 --> 01:57:17.748]  Now they're trying it here.
[01:57:17.748 --> 01:57:19.510]  As Trump said, it's treason.
[01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.771]  It is.
[01:57:20.111 --> 01:57:20.872]  Well, no doubt it is.
[01:57:20.872 --> 01:57:26.456]  I mean, it's- Chris Murphy is involved in treason against the country, the First Amendment, and is a CHICOM operative.
[01:57:26.456 --> 01:57:27.017]  It's known.
[01:57:27.017 --> 01:57:29.218]  And he's scared, really scared of the show.
[01:57:29.218 --> 01:57:31.460]  He wants us off, because we know who you are!
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:33.122]  You dirty traitor!
[01:57:33.122 --> 01:57:35.764]  You dirty anti-American filth!
[01:57:35.764 --> 01:57:37.325]  You're not gonna beat Texas!
[01:57:37.325 --> 01:57:40.468]  You're not gonna beat me, because you are filth!
[01:57:40.468 --> 01:57:41.889]  God will defeat you!
[01:57:49.978 --> 01:57:52.039]  Yeah, Alec, I just have to say something, man.
[01:57:52.039 --> 01:57:55.901]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:57:55.901 --> 01:57:57.342]  It just gets old, man.
[01:57:57.342 --> 01:57:59.764]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:57:59.764 --> 01:58:02.085]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:58:02.085 --> 01:58:06.107]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:58:06.107 --> 01:58:09.409]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:58:09.409 --> 01:58:11.751]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:58:11.751 --> 01:58:13.432]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:58:13.432 --> 01:58:14.552]  Us being shut down?
[01:58:14.552 --> 01:58:15.593]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:58:16.033 --> 01:58:17.113]  You know what, Alex?
[01:58:17.113 --> 01:58:18.194]  Hey, put him on pause again!
[01:58:18.194 --> 01:58:19.294]  Hey, Frank!
[01:58:19.294 --> 01:58:24.975]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:58:24.975 --> 01:58:29.476]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:58:29.476 --> 01:58:32.617]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:58:32.617 --> 01:58:33.077]  You understand?
[01:58:33.077 --> 01:58:34.718]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:34.718 --> 01:58:35.838]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:36.838 --> 01:58:42.442]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[01:58:42.442 --> 01:58:43.183]  Do you understand?
[01:58:43.183 --> 01:58:44.804]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:58:44.804 --> 01:58:48.367]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:58:48.367 --> 01:58:51.269]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:58:51.269 --> 01:58:53.251]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[01:58:53.251 --> 01:58:56.173]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:58:56.173 --> 01:58:58.915]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:02.601]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:59:02.601 --> 01:59:04.142]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:59:04.142 --> 01:59:10.704]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:59:10.704 --> 01:59:13.505]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[01:59:14.571 --> 01:59:17.912]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:59:17.912 --> 01:59:20.833]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:59:20.833 --> 01:59:22.533]  That sends chills up my spine.
[01:59:22.533 --> 01:59:36.077]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:59:36.077 --> 01:59:38.018]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[01:59:38.678 --> 01:59:43.941]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:59:43.941 --> 01:59:51.705]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:59:51.705 --> 01:59:54.326]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.128 --> 02:00:12.170]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:00:12.170 --> 02:00:16.371]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.371 --> 02:00:18.232]  Well, listen, I'll use his name.
[02:00:18.232 --> 02:00:29.376]  We're talking about Alex Jones and the fact of the matter is that the companies that allow people like him, conspiracy theorists, to be able to purvey lies have a responsibility.
[02:00:29.376 --> 02:00:35.218]  There is no constitutional duty on an internet company to allow somebody to terrorize parents
[02:00:35.858 --> 02:00:39.499]  Of mass tragedies like Alex Jones did for so long.
[02:00:39.499 --> 02:00:45.261]  The Newtown families are proceeding with a court case to try to hold him accountable.
[02:00:45.261 --> 02:00:58.564]  But the companies that allow for this nonsense, this garbage to be spread out over the internet, have a responsibility and a duty themselves to do something earlier than they did in the case of InfoWars.
[02:00:58.564 --> 02:01:04.746]  I wish that these parents could shut it all out, but they can't.
[02:01:05.686 --> 02:01:07.126]  That's enough of him.
[02:01:07.126 --> 02:01:09.567]  He and the media are the ones constantly promoting it.
[02:01:09.567 --> 02:01:11.027]  I barely even ever covered it.
[02:01:11.027 --> 02:01:12.568]  The internet didn't believe a lot of it.
[02:01:12.568 --> 02:01:14.248]  That's our right if people want to do that.
[02:01:14.248 --> 02:01:15.748]  And now they just won't stop.
[02:01:15.748 --> 02:01:17.749]  And it's a synthetic lie.
[02:01:17.749 --> 02:01:23.230]  And then this guy's running a stay-behind group that Obama put in government to shut down the press and Trump.
[02:01:23.230 --> 02:01:25.371]  And he's just a monster.
[02:01:25.371 --> 02:01:27.711]  I mean, he needs to be indicted for being part of this.
[02:01:27.711 --> 02:01:31.212]  And Trump is talking about indicting the co-conspirators, including Schiff.
[02:01:31.966 --> 02:01:32.526]  Oh, precisely.
[02:01:32.526 --> 02:01:50.176]  I mean, the actual coverage of InfoWars, of course, was 90% that Sandy Hook was a real event, and that the only reason, the only questions mostly that were raised were about whether there were second shooters or third shooters, whether or not Big Pharma's role in giving people SSRI drugs, where it was influencing... Let's be clear, you're the head lawyer.
[02:01:50.176 --> 02:01:52.758]  You've reviewed, you've done thousands of hours.
[02:01:53.098 --> 02:01:53.599]  Absolutely.
[02:01:53.599 --> 02:01:54.820]  So you review everything.
[02:01:54.820 --> 02:01:56.802]  Paul Watson, of course, always believed it was a real event.
[02:01:56.802 --> 02:01:58.864]  He's the editor in charge here of InfoWars.
[02:01:58.864 --> 02:02:08.654]  So that was always the message from InfoWars was whether or not the government was being straightforward, whether the government was being clear, whether the government was doing its duty to disclose accurate, honest information.
[02:02:08.654 --> 02:02:14.720]  And of course, ultimately, the Connecticut Supreme Court determined that the law enforcement had hid information that they were not supposed to hide.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:26.203]  And that included the horrifying aspect of this tragedy was that the school system did not give the teachers the means to safeguard the school by giving them the means to lock the doors from the inside.
[02:02:26.203 --> 02:02:33.925]  That was one of the things that apparently they were trying to cover up by focusing exclusively as the only sole culprit of this incident being a gun.
[02:02:33.925 --> 02:02:35.765]  They didn't want to talk about the role of drugs.
[02:02:35.765 --> 02:02:37.885]  They didn't want to talk about the role of the school system.
[02:02:37.885 --> 02:02:39.766]  They didn't want to talk about the role of law enforcement.
[02:02:40.306 --> 02:02:43.990]  Uh, that could have done things different, that could have protected people's lives.
[02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:54.683]  And that's what, and so as a consequence, you see these, some of these high-ranking politicians in Connecticut try to demonize you, and try to demonize Infowars, and try to make that the sole source of any particular problem in this particular instance.
[02:02:55.283 --> 02:03:15.037]  And that's what's happening, and it's not a coincidence that the exact same senator, Senator Murphy, that's leading this political warfare and is engaging in supporting the lawfare that's taking place, and using his political connections and ties to help accomplish and achieve that, is also the same guy that wants to suppress and censor speech across the internet of anyone who has an independent, dissident view than his.
[02:03:15.037 --> 02:03:17.599]  And again, our listeners are like, yeah, we know there's censorship.
[02:03:17.599 --> 02:03:18.900]  I understand, folks.
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:19.901]  This is the whole enchilada.
[02:03:20.541 --> 02:03:29.167]  This is the one thing Trump hasn't moved on, and I want to come back with Ben Garrison and you and talk about the next level of deception where they said they're going to take people off for the comments on their page.
[02:03:29.167 --> 02:03:31.309]  So we're having to prepare legal actions just to defend ourselves.
[02:03:31.309 --> 02:03:35.251]  I mean, this is a nightmare situation, but it's because, as you said, our speech is the truth.
[02:03:35.251 --> 02:03:35.692]  It's winning.
[02:03:37.168 --> 02:03:42.731]  But just briefly, what should the President do in 60 seconds first to stop these people?
[02:03:42.731 --> 02:03:53.018]  So he should do the same thing he did for universities and colleges and say that grants and other federal funding of these various big tech social media giants will not continue unless they support free speech and the First Amendment.
[02:03:53.018 --> 02:04:01.763]  And he should propose legislative changes to Section 230 of the Immunity Laws that says unless they comply with the First Amendment, they're no longer immune under the law.
[02:04:01.763 --> 02:04:05.085]  Those two steps by themselves could reverse the equation in this situation.
[02:04:05.505 --> 02:04:13.608]  And could mean, for example, just yesterday, Unplanned, a very popular movie, that's a pro-life movie, Twitter basically took them off and shadow banned them.
[02:04:13.608 --> 02:04:17.050]  They said you can't promote it and you can't spend money and promote it.
[02:04:17.050 --> 02:04:20.791]  Not only that, when people were trying to follow them, they would be unfollowed five seconds later.
[02:04:20.791 --> 02:04:25.473]  So someone would follow the Twitter feed, then it would magically... It's everybody's speech.
[02:04:25.473 --> 02:04:26.114]  Absolutely.
[02:04:26.114 --> 02:04:27.954]  They're not going to stop at Alex Jones.
[02:04:27.954 --> 02:04:31.716]  They're using Alex Jones as the example to stop and suppress independent speech everywhere.
[02:04:33.265 --> 02:04:34.726]  It's like East Germany.
[02:04:34.726 --> 02:04:35.107]  Precisely.
[02:04:35.107 --> 02:04:36.668]  It's very much a Stasi mentality.
[02:04:36.668 --> 02:04:38.129]  It's a Soviet mentality.
[02:04:38.129 --> 02:04:40.010]  That's what the new left believes in.
[02:04:40.010 --> 02:04:40.910]  They believe in control.
[02:04:40.910 --> 02:04:43.192]  They don't believe in freedom.
[02:04:43.192 --> 02:04:46.694]  Pro-life movie unplanned, blocked on Twitter, hours after release.
[02:04:46.694 --> 02:04:48.736]  And then I think they... It was Google banned the ad.
[02:04:48.736 --> 02:04:49.316]  Yeah, pull that up.
[02:04:49.316 --> 02:04:50.977]  I'm talking about that when you come back.
[02:04:50.977 --> 02:04:53.759]  Google banned the... No, we're not taking your money!
[02:04:53.759 --> 02:04:56.200]  Your money's no good here!
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:01.124]  Wars are like 12-round heavyweight boxing championship fights.
[02:05:02.401 --> 02:05:08.304]  It's about who wants it, who's prepared to go the longest, and who's ready to do the damage.
[02:05:08.304 --> 02:05:09.905]  We took on Hillary Clinton.
[02:05:09.905 --> 02:05:10.405]  We stopped her.
[02:05:10.405 --> 02:05:12.606]  We got a nationalist in.
[02:05:12.606 --> 02:05:14.788]  Nationalists are getting elected all over the world right now.
[02:05:14.788 --> 02:05:16.548]  We are winning.
[02:05:16.548 --> 02:05:22.091]  But those of us who are at the very front line, at the tip of the spear, are under unprecedented attack.
[02:05:22.091 --> 02:05:27.174]  So I come to you each day and try to explain to you that this is a war of attrition.
[02:05:27.174 --> 02:05:28.275]  This is about who wants it most.
[02:05:29.716 --> 02:05:33.259]  You know the persecution, the censorship, the sponsors, they've taken everything.
[02:05:33.259 --> 02:05:35.381]  I am in your hands, you are in my hands.
[02:05:35.381 --> 02:05:38.604]  I need financial support and I got products you and your family need.
[02:05:38.604 --> 02:05:39.725]  It's that simple.
[02:05:39.725 --> 02:05:41.166]  Thousands of great products.
[02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:47.311]  Whatever's award-winning, whatever's best-selling, what folks love, what I love, we bring it to you at InfoWorksShore.com.
[02:05:47.311 --> 02:05:55.399]  So please, go to InfoWorksShore.com today, look at all the great products, because we're in your hands, I'm in your hands, and your support is beyond critical.
[02:05:55.399 --> 02:05:55.699]  Thank you.
[02:06:00.336 --> 02:06:03.301]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[02:06:03.301 --> 02:06:05.465]  Because it leads to the future.
[02:06:05.465 --> 02:06:08.910]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:06:08.910 --> 02:06:09.832]  This is not a new world.
[02:06:11.158 --> 02:06:15.559]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:06:15.559 --> 02:06:24.001]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:06:24.001 --> 02:06:32.042]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[02:06:32.042 --> 02:06:37.763]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[02:06:37.763 --> 02:06:40.004]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[02:06:45.370 --> 02:06:48.091]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[02:06:48.091 --> 02:06:54.753]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[02:06:54.753 --> 02:06:59.515]  Because he's built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[02:06:59.515 --> 02:07:04.197]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[02:07:24.016 --> 02:07:46.517]  He'd play the Red River Valley He'd sit out in the kitchen and cry And run his fingers through seventy years of livin' And wonder, Lord, as ever will our drill run dry
[02:07:49.096 --> 02:08:15.249]  We were friends Me and this old man Like desperadoes waiting for a train Like desperadoes waiting for a train Here's a drifter and a driller of oil wells
[02:08:17.364 --> 02:08:44.730]  And an old school man of the world He let me drive his car when he's too drunk to And he'd wink and give me money for the girls And our lives were like some old western movie Like desperadoes waiting for
[02:08:52.475 --> 02:08:55.758]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:08:55.758 --> 02:08:56.318]  to 3 p.m.
[02:08:56.318 --> 02:08:57.819]  we're here live.
[02:08:57.819 --> 02:08:59.241]  David Knight!
[02:08:59.241 --> 02:09:02.183]  8 a.m.
[02:09:02.183 --> 02:09:03.664]  The David Knight Show Central.
[02:09:03.664 --> 02:09:05.065]  Owen Schroeder, The War Room.
[02:09:05.065 --> 02:09:06.567]  3 p.m.
[02:09:06.567 --> 02:09:09.449]  Central.
[02:09:09.449 --> 02:09:11.831]  And they're doing their best to keep us from launching more shows.
[02:09:11.831 --> 02:09:13.953]  I plan to have like 20 hours live by the end of last year.
[02:09:13.953 --> 02:09:15.134]  We couldn't under all the attacks.
[02:09:16.227 --> 02:09:17.729]  And, you know, they fought us to a standstill.
[02:09:17.729 --> 02:09:18.589]  I'll just give you that report.
[02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:19.390]  It'll make them happy.
[02:09:19.390 --> 02:09:22.533]  That's why we need your support financially behind the products.
[02:09:22.533 --> 02:09:23.534]  TheInfoWarsTore.com.
[02:09:23.534 --> 02:09:29.079]  We're having huge victories in the fight against the globalists, but because of that, they're focusing on us to take us out.
[02:09:29.079 --> 02:09:31.081]  This is a war.
[02:09:31.081 --> 02:09:35.265]  They tried to get the president, so now they're focusing on myself and others.
[02:09:35.265 --> 02:09:37.928]  And as we told you, once the censorship was complete with me,
[02:09:40.728 --> 02:09:43.530]  They would then move on to everybody else's speech, and it's all over the news.
[02:09:43.530 --> 02:09:46.612]  TV networks reject ads for anti-abortion movie.
[02:09:46.612 --> 02:09:51.375]  Twitter blocking users from following anti-abortion film in second.
[02:09:51.375 --> 02:09:52.155]  Recent glitch.
[02:09:52.155 --> 02:09:53.736]  Every time they get caught, it's always a glitch.
[02:09:53.736 --> 02:09:58.039]  Then we get internal documents that it's not.
[02:09:58.039 --> 02:10:03.643]  And then we also have Wired even admitting that Ben Garrison got false flags.
[02:10:03.643 --> 02:10:06.104]  And I thought of him when this happened to us last week.
[02:10:06.104 --> 02:10:09.286]  He is the most prolific political cartoonist in the world today.
[02:10:09.286 --> 02:10:09.827]  He was already
[02:10:11.263 --> 02:10:20.186]  In the top 20 or so, in mainstream magazines and newspapers, started just doing some basic libertarian stuff, and boy, they attacked him, so he went full-time!
[02:10:20.186 --> 02:10:25.528]  And he is undoubtedly the biggest political cartoonist, if not the biggest cartoonist in the world now.
[02:10:26.624 --> 02:10:28.044]  And so how did they go after him?
[02:10:28.044 --> 02:10:29.545]  Well, they said the alt-right did it.
[02:10:29.545 --> 02:10:30.045]  No, they didn't.
[02:10:30.045 --> 02:10:30.825]  They do this to me.
[02:10:30.825 --> 02:10:32.206]  The leftists, the troll farms.
[02:10:32.206 --> 02:10:33.886]  We've infiltrated them.
[02:10:33.886 --> 02:10:37.727]  They started taking his great art and putting Nazi stuff on it.
[02:10:37.727 --> 02:10:40.848]  And the Southern Poverty Law Center and everybody else went along with it and said it was Ben Garrison.
[02:10:40.848 --> 02:10:44.649]  Even though they could go in two minutes and go to his website.
[02:10:46.502 --> 02:10:49.683]  And see that the original art was there, they didn't care.
[02:10:49.683 --> 02:10:52.244]  Well, they've done the same thing to me now.
[02:10:52.244 --> 02:11:04.069]  They're wanting the final Instagram and Facebooks that we never had banned, that were left up, that quote, didn't violate the rules, and a few racist comments, a few anti-Israel, against me!
[02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:10.152]  And they said, oh yes, if it goes up to 30% anti-Semitic in the comments, we'll ban them, wink wink, giving the order.
[02:11:11.391 --> 02:11:12.112]  We're folks that go do it.
[02:11:12.112 --> 02:11:14.033]  And now, I only have two moderators.
[02:11:14.033 --> 02:11:20.759]  They're having to sit in there and delete these comments as fast as they come in, because we know it's a false flag.
[02:11:20.759 --> 02:11:22.341]  They're smolleting me.
[02:11:22.341 --> 02:11:29.487]  The term that I coined, meaning when you go stage a hate crime against yourself to blame right-wingers, it's called smolleting.
[02:11:29.487 --> 02:11:31.469]  And I'm just a libertarian.
[02:11:31.469 --> 02:11:36.153]  So, leaked emails reveal Facebook's intense internal discussion over Alex Jones' anti-Semitic posts on Instagram.
[02:11:37.472 --> 02:11:46.917]  When other people are talking about five anti-Semitic comments out of 560, their own emails came out, I'm the anti-Semite.
[02:11:46.917 --> 02:11:53.341]  And of course it's Jake Cantor, who doesn't want to retract because he wants to get sued, who first reported it and created the whole story.
[02:11:53.341 --> 02:11:58.824]  So we're going to go to Ben Garrison, but just briefly, we're going to ride shotgun on this a few segments.
[02:11:58.824 --> 02:12:00.785]  Bob Barnes, what do you call this?
[02:12:00.785 --> 02:12:03.227]  I mean, it's clearly a false flag.
[02:12:03.507 --> 02:12:05.249]  I was going to say, it's a new form of false flag.
[02:12:05.249 --> 02:12:24.791]  The new form of false flag is to go on somebody else's page, pretend to be a supporter, and by pretending to be a supporter, say things that violate the terms of service of that particular social media network, and thereby get that person deplatformed, that person's post taken away, that person's ability to post taken away, and as Facebook admitted, their ultimate objective
[02:12:25.171 --> 02:12:31.214]  Is to label a person by their name in such a way that their name has to be the person who cannot be named.
[02:12:31.214 --> 02:12:35.236]  That if you even said the words Alex Jones, you could be banned off of social media.
[02:12:35.236 --> 02:12:52.043]  That was their ultimate goal and objective and the entire premise and predicate for it was to get people to basically falsely have these trolls, these lefty trolls, pretend to be racist, post racist things, then report their own post and say, holy cow, look at all these racist comments that are on this post.
[02:12:52.043 --> 02:12:53.724]  And we've confirmed it in IP addresses.
[02:12:54.184 --> 02:13:00.265]  When we do our own comments on the site, which we've gone back to, we can see the same guys posing as 20 people saying racist things to each other.
[02:13:00.265 --> 02:13:00.525]  Exactly.
[02:13:00.525 --> 02:13:01.806]  They've been doing it for a long time.
[02:13:01.806 --> 02:13:05.346]  Because the troll farm was a leftist invention, not a Russian invention.
[02:13:05.346 --> 02:13:06.987]  And Candace Owens caught them doing it to her.
[02:13:06.987 --> 02:13:07.387]  Exactly.
[02:13:07.387 --> 02:13:08.187]  And they've done it repeatedly.
[02:13:08.187 --> 02:13:10.648]  A lot of people have caught them over the last half decade or so.
[02:13:10.648 --> 02:13:14.989]  It was like feminists going, the Nazis want to get you, but we're going to protect you, because she was doing well online.
[02:13:14.989 --> 02:13:16.629]  And then she checked IPs, it was the same people.
[02:13:16.809 --> 02:13:17.490]  Precisely.
[02:13:17.490 --> 02:13:23.536]  They did it to Reddit to take down a whole bunch of sections of Reddit so that those sections disappeared forever from commentary.
[02:13:23.536 --> 02:13:24.517]  So they've been doing it.
[02:13:24.517 --> 02:13:26.700]  They've done it on Twitter repeatedly and routinely.
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:30.424]  For example, they blamed Milo for something that actually wasn't what Milo did.
[02:13:30.424 --> 02:13:33.828]  It was what they did to get Milo banned off of Twitter.
[02:13:33.828 --> 02:13:35.429]  So it's been a consistent pattern.
[02:13:35.429 --> 02:13:36.350]  They know it's happening.
[02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:37.171]  They know it's occurring.
[02:13:38.012 --> 02:13:44.797]  The left in the streets, I've noticed, has adopted the fraud from the highest levels.
[02:13:44.797 --> 02:13:46.238]  They know it's lies.
[02:13:46.238 --> 02:13:47.259]  They're like an army.
[02:13:47.259 --> 02:13:49.020]  It was like when I was at Lucy's Fried Chicken.
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:53.904]  They come to my table three times to threaten me, and then when I walk out, they threaten me more.
[02:13:53.904 --> 02:13:59.268]  Then they edit the tape and say I attacked them, but luckily the restaurant's now gone public.
[02:13:59.268 --> 02:13:59.969]  Alex is welcome.
[02:13:59.969 --> 02:14:01.270]  They started fights three times.
[02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:02.190]  They threw them out.
[02:14:02.190 --> 02:14:02.811]  I was leaving.
[02:14:03.917 --> 02:14:06.618]  But again, hundreds of papers ran with the lie!
[02:14:06.618 --> 02:14:08.459]  Well precisely, just like they did at Covington.
[02:14:08.459 --> 02:14:09.980]  It's about edited video.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:15.342]  And with the modern technology, the ability to edit video and to create false narratives and false stories is at an all-new high.
[02:14:15.342 --> 02:14:18.124]  And they're just using comment sections now to achieve that and accomplish that.
[02:14:18.124 --> 02:14:19.724]  Ben Garrison, you're with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:14:19.724 --> 02:14:21.145]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:14:21.145 --> 02:14:26.688]  We're going to talk all about this, but what do you call this situation?
[02:14:26.688 --> 02:14:31.310]  Well, it's an attack on people like you and me who
[02:14:32.381 --> 02:14:35.483]  Want to preserve the republic?
[02:14:35.483 --> 02:14:42.586]  We're libertarians, we're conservatives, we're not alt-right, we're not far-right, and we're not Nazis, and we're not anti-semitic.
[02:14:42.586 --> 02:14:49.109]  I mean, that's the narrative that gets foisted upon us.
[02:14:49.109 --> 02:14:56.513]  You know, I've, as you know, I went through years of hell with this because I was an unknown cartoonist.
[02:14:56.513 --> 02:14:56.733]  I mean,
[02:14:57.711 --> 02:15:05.459]  In 2009, and it's been almost 10 years since I penned my first independent editorial cartoon.
[02:15:05.459 --> 02:15:06.380]  And what did I draw?
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:09.023]  It was an anti-Federal Reserve cartoon.
[02:15:09.023 --> 02:15:14.729]  Because I was thinking to myself, well, how come I haven't seen any anti-Federal Reserve cartoons drawn by
[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:19.342]  You know, conventional liberal cartoonists out there.
[02:15:19.342 --> 02:15:20.343]  I've never seen any.
[02:15:20.343 --> 02:15:21.504]  I'm going to draw them then.
[02:15:21.504 --> 02:15:24.726]  So I drew them and then I quickly found out why.
[02:15:24.726 --> 02:15:29.389]  Because when you do that, you get attacked fairly quickly.
[02:15:29.389 --> 02:15:38.395]  And by 2010, my work was being routinely defaced and vandalized into anti-Semitic and racist
[02:15:39.446 --> 02:15:44.890]  Stay right there.
[02:15:44.890 --> 02:15:46.591]  Let's talk about this when we come back.
[02:15:46.591 --> 02:15:50.093]  And again, Nazis and people have a right to their free speech.
[02:15:50.093 --> 02:15:53.135]  The point is now the left projects on us and says we don't have a right.
[02:15:53.135 --> 02:15:53.915]  Everybody has a right.
[02:15:53.915 --> 02:15:54.776]  Remember that in America?
[02:15:55.456 --> 02:15:56.717]  Maybe not today.
[02:15:56.717 --> 02:15:57.997]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:57.997 --> 02:16:01.739]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:01.739 --> 02:16:02.820]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:04.660]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:06.361]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[02:16:55.066 --> 02:16:56.287]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.287 --> 02:17:00.209]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.209 --> 02:17:01.750]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:04.692]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.692 --> 02:17:10.256]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.256 --> 02:17:11.457]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.457 --> 02:17:14.399]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.399 --> 02:17:16.620]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:21.063]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:17:21.063 --> 02:17:23.364]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[02:17:31.328 --> 02:17:34.149]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[02:17:56.434 --> 02:18:02.477]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:18:02.477 --> 02:18:05.398]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootwearStore.com.
[02:18:05.398 --> 02:18:09.440]  With MFootwear Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply.

[02:18:56.135 --> 02:19:04.526]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.526 --> 02:19:05.768]  Believe me, I know.
[02:19:05.768 --> 02:19:10.695]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.695 --> 02:19:13.759]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:19:14.239 --> 02:19:15.921]  I still have that energy.
[02:19:15.921 --> 02:19:36.080]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:19:36.580 --> 02:19:40.341]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:19:40.341 --> 02:19:44.243]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.
[02:19:44.243 --> 02:19:49.244]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[02:19:49.244 --> 02:19:51.965]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[02:19:51.965 --> 02:19:59.168]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:19:59.168 --> 02:20:01.829]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:10.529 --> 02:20:12.830]  The Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:20.454]  Just a good old boy, never meanin' no harm.
[02:20:20.454 --> 02:20:27.438]  Beats all you never saw, been in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
[02:20:27.438 --> 02:20:34.461]  Straightenin' the curve, flattenin' the hills.
[02:20:34.461 --> 02:20:38.103]  Someday the mountain might get him, but the law never will.
[02:20:44.224 --> 02:20:57.879]  I'm going to host some of the next hour when Gerald Cilente is on because there's a bunch of breaking news I haven't gotten to.
[02:20:57.879 --> 02:21:04.166]  We also have exclusive video and footage of the Border Patrol delivering illegal aliens to leftist centers.
[02:21:05.188 --> 02:21:08.790]  Now the Border Patrol first told us about this five years ago, and we exposed it.
[02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:09.610]  It's happening again.
[02:21:09.610 --> 02:21:15.574]  And that's because there's not enough room at the detention centers.
[02:21:15.574 --> 02:21:18.135]  And under law, once they get across, they can't turn them back.
[02:21:18.135 --> 02:21:19.656]  They'll say, well, Trump just needs to do it.
[02:21:19.656 --> 02:21:21.177]  There's law.
[02:21:21.177 --> 02:21:23.058]  It's got to be changed.
[02:21:23.058 --> 02:21:25.559]  And McAllen said, you know, usually their record number is, what, 3,000?
[02:21:25.559 --> 02:21:26.280]  They've getting about 15,000 a day.
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:26.820]  El Paso's record is about 3,000.
[02:21:26.820 --> 02:21:27.720]  They're getting about 15,000 a day.
[02:21:32.901 --> 02:21:36.427]  This has all been initiated by the Democrats and the Globalists saying, come to El Norte, it's all free.
[02:21:36.427 --> 02:21:38.951]  So the border's broken right now.
[02:21:38.951 --> 02:21:42.176]  And the Border Patrol isn't even allowed to take people to be medically checked.
[02:21:43.762 --> 02:21:46.124]  And so they're being trafficked, you name it, that's been confirmed.
[02:21:46.124 --> 02:21:47.705]  That's the start of the next hour.
[02:21:47.705 --> 02:21:51.668]  That is exclusive on Infowars.com.
[02:21:51.668 --> 02:21:53.970]  It was shot by a reporter who was so threatened.
[02:21:53.970 --> 02:21:56.312]  A famous reporter shot this.
[02:21:56.312 --> 02:22:04.859]  A famous reporter gave this to us, who did this on her own, separate from the news network she works for.
[02:22:04.859 --> 02:22:06.440]  That's what it's gotten down to in this country.
[02:22:07.409 --> 02:22:10.410]  I'm at liberty to tell you who, but this is getting Twilight Zone.
[02:22:10.410 --> 02:22:15.211]  That's why InfoWars is so important, is we're the place that'll put this out, and only you can amplify it.
[02:22:15.211 --> 02:22:28.454]  So getting back to Mr. Garrison here, who of course does the great work over at his website, GRRRGraphics.com, and still at Twitter for now, at Graphics.
[02:22:28.454 --> 02:22:33.896]  Ben, you were getting into the systematic false flagging, but also just the censorship, the shadow banning.
[02:22:35.496 --> 02:22:44.443]  I mean, speak more of your experiences, and of course, attorney at law here, great First Amendment lawyer, one of the top ones in the country, Bob Barnes, to give us your expert take on how we counter this.
[02:22:44.443 --> 02:22:51.989]  Because I keep beating the drum here, folks, that if this is the one thing that could lose 2020, it's the one thing where they're winning, is the censorship.
[02:22:51.989 --> 02:22:53.110]  It's what we've got to focus on.
[02:22:53.846 --> 02:22:54.767]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:22:54.767 --> 02:23:02.512]  And the way they've targeted even cartoonists like Ben, who's sort of innocuous in terms of his graphics.
[02:23:02.512 --> 02:23:04.793]  Very nice, family-friendly, but very effective.
[02:23:04.793 --> 02:23:05.373]  Correct.
[02:23:05.373 --> 02:23:07.395]  There's nothing bad about it at all.
[02:23:07.395 --> 02:23:09.256]  It's just politically sage.
[02:23:09.256 --> 02:23:13.759]  And it's using an art form that the left had had a large degree of cultural control over.
[02:23:14.019 --> 02:23:17.021]  Ben, what do you think of this new level, though, where comments on my Instagram
[02:23:44.189 --> 02:23:58.660]  Well yeah, I mean I tried my best to counter the defamation and copyright infringement.
[02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:03.984]  Look, at first I did what everybody says you should do is ignore the trolls.
[02:24:03.984 --> 02:24:06.907]  Okay, I ignored the trolls for two years and it got worse.
[02:24:07.982 --> 02:24:13.207]  I came to the conclusion, okay, you don't do anything about the trolling, it's going to get worse.
[02:24:13.207 --> 02:24:16.849]  You do something about it, it's going to get worse.
[02:24:16.849 --> 02:24:34.604]  And by 2014, Facebook had hosted ten pages of impersonators, impersonating me, with all the vandalized cartoons, me calling for murder, murder of African Americans, murder of Jews, blatant, let's kill them, and Facebook would write back,
[02:24:35.279 --> 02:24:37.341]  Doesn't violate our community standards.
[02:24:37.341 --> 02:24:40.103]  And so I had to endure this and all this went on the search engines.
[02:24:40.103 --> 02:24:52.872]  And if anybody typed in that time period, if anybody typed in... Listen, I had you on like five years ago and people were emailing me saying, why are you having that anti-Semite on?
[02:24:52.872 --> 02:24:57.275]  Well, it's one of these things where it's designed to shut you up.
[02:24:57.938 --> 02:24:59.299]  They want you shut up.
[02:24:59.299 --> 02:25:03.263]  And if they can just use these brutal... Look, these people have all the power.
[02:25:03.263 --> 02:25:13.732]  The social media, the Zuckerbergs, and, you know, the Dorsey people, all the Silicon Valley chieftains, they have the power.
[02:25:13.732 --> 02:25:16.975]  But power is not sufficient evidence of truth.
[02:25:16.975 --> 02:25:17.295]  That's right.
[02:25:17.295 --> 02:25:19.076]  I think people are starting to realize that.
[02:25:19.076 --> 02:25:23.961]  They don't have a lock on the truth, but they pretend they do because they're the authorities.
[02:25:24.858 --> 02:25:31.944]  Anyway, it really destroyed my commercial art career because I was drawing the cartoons on the side for free.
[02:25:31.944 --> 02:25:33.745]  I didn't expect to make money on the cartoons.
[02:25:33.745 --> 02:25:34.706]  I didn't want to make money.
[02:25:34.706 --> 02:25:37.088]  I saw it as my patriotic duty.
[02:25:37.088 --> 02:25:50.439]  I was making money through my commercial art business, which continued to dry up to the point where I could not get a job from any corporation because HR departments are inhabited by SJWs who have nothing to do with anything
[02:25:51.398 --> 02:25:53.722]  You know, anything that is controversial, like me.
[02:26:05.896 --> 02:26:10.040]  of a restaurant this weekend that you said, no, we don't serve you here, get out of here, which is fine.
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:17.728]  I wish they'd put a sign on the door saying, we don't support free speech, we don't support conservatives or Christians, then I would, believe me, I do not want to come in your place.
[02:26:17.728 --> 02:26:28.378]  But they are literally getting to this level where now they'll false flag you on the streets when I'm saying, Ben, like the average leftist now will literally attack you and then say you did it and then giggle about it.
[02:26:28.378 --> 02:26:29.999]  I mean, something happened to the left.
[02:26:31.140 --> 02:26:33.722]  They love war and National Gallup polls now.
[02:26:33.722 --> 02:26:38.064]  The average quote liberal or leftist is pro-war just because Trump's anti-war.
[02:26:38.064 --> 02:26:39.085]  And an anti-free speech.
[02:26:39.085 --> 02:26:43.327]  And what you see is it's very much like the 1920s communist style infiltration.
[02:26:43.327 --> 02:26:58.256]  Because what Ben is talking about is that the people who believe in this sort of SJW social justice warrior Stasi style mentality of cultural control, who believe in sort of the old Catholic inquisitional mechanism of thought control, which is they've gone to human relations departments
[02:26:58.536 --> 02:26:59.397]  It's a conscious cult!
[02:26:59.397 --> 02:26:59.737]  It's a cult!
[02:27:16.411 --> 02:27:16.751]  Absolutely.
[02:27:16.751 --> 02:27:17.132]  It's a cult.
[02:27:17.132 --> 02:27:17.752]  It's a cult.
[02:27:17.752 --> 02:27:20.415]  And they're heavily influenced in, of course, education as well.
[02:27:20.415 --> 02:27:24.539]  Both at the public education level, elementary schools, all the way up to public universities.
[02:27:24.539 --> 02:27:29.743]  And so their last bastion of independent thought and freedom that exists out there is the independent free press.
[02:27:29.743 --> 02:27:31.805]  People like Ben and his independent cartoons.
[02:27:31.805 --> 02:27:33.867]  And that's why they target them for harassment.
[02:27:33.867 --> 02:27:42.015]  If they weren't successful, if Ben wasn't successful, if Ben wasn't popular, if he wasn't speaking a deep, deep truth, they wouldn't need to suppress, censor, and shame him the way they have.
[02:27:42.795 --> 02:27:44.597]  Well, I mean, they fear memes.
[02:27:44.597 --> 02:27:45.938]  The EU's trying to ban memes.
[02:27:45.938 --> 02:27:47.539]  That just means ban cartoons.
[02:27:47.539 --> 02:27:56.106]  As long as humans have been here, we've drawn things on the cave walls, we've drawn things in the sand, and then whoever could draw the best were like, well, you're the chief, you know, basically.
[02:27:56.106 --> 02:27:57.247]  Who could communicate best?
[02:27:57.247 --> 02:28:00.269]  And so what they're saying is, you don't even get to use language.
[02:28:01.050 --> 02:28:01.971]  Think about the power!
[02:28:01.971 --> 02:28:05.113]  I want to come back with Ben and ask him about that and how he thinks we fight back.
[02:28:05.113 --> 02:28:07.014]  But, you know, I meant to do this and I get so busy.
[02:28:07.014 --> 02:28:08.795]  People can go to his website and buy some of his prints.
[02:28:08.795 --> 02:28:10.236]  We have them all over the office.
[02:28:10.236 --> 02:28:27.467]  Graphics.com and hopefully sometime we're planning to set up or some folks want to work with a site where we have art to actually finance the Liberty Movement because artists that are telling the truth need to be funded because, as you heard him, he was a successful guy doing covers of magazines, all that stuff.
[02:28:28.686 --> 02:28:31.468]  And he lost his business as he stood up for America.
[02:28:31.468 --> 02:28:33.549]  And if you look at his work, it's pretty libertarian.
[02:28:33.549 --> 02:28:36.891]  We'll talk to Ben Garrison in one more segment with you as well, Bob Barnes.
[02:28:36.891 --> 02:28:40.873]  And then we are going to do the fourth hour with Gerald Cilente.
[02:28:40.873 --> 02:28:46.076]  And I'm going to do part of it to break a bunch of exclusive news that's up on newswars.com.
[02:28:46.076 --> 02:28:52.580]  Pretty powerful footage to see the Border Patrol acting as Uber to deliver the illegal aliens into the country.
[02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:53.981]  But that's what they have to do by law.
[02:28:54.994 --> 02:28:57.377]  Know someone with a drinking or drug problem?
[02:28:57.377 --> 02:29:00.240]  Learn how to get sober after we share these stories.
[02:29:00.240 --> 02:29:05.325]  I was 35 with two beautiful children when my life and addiction started to spiral out of control.
[02:29:05.325 --> 02:29:12.513]  After my divorce, I went into a depression cycle and started drinking more often and using prescription drugs.
[02:29:12.513 --> 02:29:17.058]  After my second DWI and arrest, my ex-husband threatened to take our children away from me.
[02:29:17.638 --> 02:29:21.281]  I was 17 when I became addicted to heroin and meth.
[02:29:21.281 --> 02:29:24.403]  I thought I could quit on my own, but I couldn't.
[02:29:24.403 --> 02:29:27.024]  It hit me when I was arrested.
[02:29:27.024 --> 02:29:28.525]  Get sober now.
[02:29:28.525 --> 02:29:31.888]  Your private insurance may cover costs and we'll get you here.
[02:29:31.888 --> 02:29:32.668]  It's simple.

[02:34:42.898 --> 02:34:49.619]  Storewide, free shipping storewide, double Patriot points, without your purchases, we are unable to carry this out.
[02:34:49.619 --> 02:34:55.360]  So Ben, I've been asking a lot of questions, but I wanted, and I want Bob, this segment, he's still with us, to ask any questions.
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:56.120]  He's got our statements.
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:35:09.463]  But other points you'd like to make about this censorship, because I know that Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, they all got everybody in the last 20 years with their own websites and their own businesses and their own billboards to point them there.
[02:35:10.768 --> 02:35:16.532]  To their Facebook and YouTube pages and Twitter pages, people believing it was theirs.
[02:35:16.532 --> 02:35:20.515]  And Twitter left it out there and let the most outrageous stuff go on forever.
[02:35:20.515 --> 02:35:26.579]  But now they're just cracking down and saying, you can't say, learn to code.
[02:35:26.579 --> 02:35:34.344]  There's an article up on Infowars.com, the top story right now, where people are coming out saying, what is this?
[02:35:34.344 --> 02:35:39.367]  I mean, the language policing is like beyond the worst university you've ever seen.
[02:35:39.367 --> 02:35:40.608]  Where do you think this is all going?
[02:35:42.549 --> 02:35:45.931]  It's not going to a good place, Alex.
[02:35:45.931 --> 02:35:50.474]  We see what's going on in China with their social credit system, and we already have that.
[02:35:51.224 --> 02:36:12.306]  In the beginnings of that here, where if you're a conservative and you want to speak up and preserve the republic, which we're a republic now in form rather than substance, because we let a big bureaucratic authoritarian oligarchy take over.
[02:36:12.306 --> 02:36:13.787]  But now if you've
[02:36:15.525 --> 02:36:22.327]  You have a low social credit now if you're just Christian or white or male, it seems like, or heterosexual.
[02:36:22.327 --> 02:36:33.929]  But if you violate what they see as their guidelines of free speech, you could have PayPal pull the plug on you.
[02:36:33.929 --> 02:36:36.830]  Some people can't do any banking.
[02:36:37.797 --> 02:36:42.939]  So, you know, as much as I detest Nazis, I still think they have a right of free speech.
[02:36:42.939 --> 02:36:48.500]  And the ACLU actually used to defend Nazis and give them the right to speak out in March.
[02:36:48.500 --> 02:36:58.343]  But now they just go ahead and try to get... And if you have unpopular speech, unpopular to the SJW crowd, they go after your employment.
[02:36:58.343 --> 02:36:59.223]  They did that to me.
[02:36:59.223 --> 02:37:04.145]  I had somebody write me and say, I'm not going to rest until you're fired and out on the streets.
[02:37:04.145 --> 02:37:05.525]  He didn't know I was self-employed.
[02:37:06.218 --> 02:37:08.439]  But in effect, my business was compromised.
[02:37:08.439 --> 02:37:13.420]  And in fact, I got kicked out of the art gallery I was in up here because all the trolls ganged up on the art gallery.
[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:15.701]  Oh, we've lost five of our six bank accounts.
[02:37:15.701 --> 02:37:17.201]  They don't want you to make money.
[02:37:17.201 --> 02:37:21.682]  And if we had no supporters, and that's what we turned it around.
[02:37:21.682 --> 02:37:23.123]  We turned it around around 2016.
[02:37:23.123 --> 02:37:31.165]  And Tina just said, my wife Tina says, I'm going to get on social media and I'm going to spread those cartoons better than the trolls are.
[02:37:31.165 --> 02:37:31.725]  And she did.
[02:37:31.725 --> 02:37:34.586]  She made it her full time job and she worked long hours.
[02:37:35.923 --> 02:37:38.284]  So that I could regain my own voice.
[02:37:38.284 --> 02:37:43.849]  But we could not have had the success we've had recently without help from supporters.
[02:37:43.849 --> 02:37:48.092]  And as reluctant as I was to rattle a tin cup around, I said, yeah, I can't do it.
[02:37:48.092 --> 02:37:49.193]  I can't do it by myself.
[02:37:49.193 --> 02:37:51.915]  I won't be able to draw the cartoons without help.
[02:37:51.915 --> 02:37:54.757]  And fortunately, we've had a lot of people who like my cartoons.
[02:37:56.405 --> 02:37:57.586]  Keep us afloat.
[02:37:57.586 --> 02:38:01.369]  And now we have a book coming out this summer to mark the 10-year anniversary.
[02:38:01.369 --> 02:38:04.252]  It's called Ben's Big Book of Editorial Cartoons.
[02:38:04.252 --> 02:38:05.613]  I want to order a bunch.
[02:38:05.613 --> 02:38:06.414]  I want to order a bunch.
[02:38:06.414 --> 02:38:11.518]  So I'm going to get you on the line with my order, folks, because I want to be selling them at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:38:11.518 --> 02:38:14.221]  I can't wait to put one on my coffee table because you're
[02:38:15.021 --> 02:38:18.162]  They're pro-family, they're pro-America, they're family-friendly.
[02:38:18.162 --> 02:38:21.183]  I think churches ought to have these.
[02:38:21.183 --> 02:38:24.344]  People have the money, you should buy two copies and donate one to the library.
[02:38:24.344 --> 02:38:28.425]  Because people, understand, a book like that's going to get checked out hundreds of times.
[02:38:28.425 --> 02:38:31.466]  And a book like that will wake up young people as well.
[02:38:31.466 --> 02:38:38.708]  I love your cartoons because they're timeless, they're evergreen, and they're good for adults and children.
[02:38:38.708 --> 02:38:39.209]  Well, thank you.
[02:38:41.551 --> 02:38:45.433]  I, like I said, though, I mean, I couldn't, I wouldn't be here without the supporters.
[02:38:45.433 --> 02:38:55.539]  I just wouldn't be because I, I have spent the last of our savings in 2014 on a book and the book was designed to prove to the world that I wasn't a racist, anti-Semitic Nazi.
[02:38:56.343 --> 02:38:57.224]  And the book flopped.
[02:38:57.224 --> 02:38:59.006]  And after that, I was ready to throw in the towel.
[02:38:59.006 --> 02:39:07.875]  I said, these cartoons cost me nothing but grief, and cost me so much money, and it cost me my sanity, almost, because I was walking around white-hot mad all the time.
[02:39:07.875 --> 02:39:13.781]  Sure, but Ben, isn't it fair to say that it made you an even better cartoonist, and that you are now more successful than you've ever been?
[02:39:14.983 --> 02:39:15.563]  Yes, it did.
[02:39:15.563 --> 02:39:16.324]  But you know what?
[02:39:16.324 --> 02:39:19.687]  Now I look back at it and I can't imagine why I got so angry.
[02:39:19.687 --> 02:39:21.748]  Now I'm able to laugh at the trolls.
[02:39:21.748 --> 02:39:27.913]  And when I see places like 4chan that still deface my cartoons once in a while, I even laugh at those.
[02:39:27.913 --> 02:39:29.414]  It just doesn't bother me anymore.
[02:39:29.414 --> 02:39:32.196]  Maybe I just got so calloused by the experience.
[02:39:32.196 --> 02:39:35.078]  Well, you also had mainstream media claiming that that was your cartoons.
[02:39:35.078 --> 02:39:37.160]  So they've had to back off now that you've fought back.
[02:39:40.247 --> 02:39:46.074]  What will people, if we defeat the censorship, what will they call this period that we're alive in right now?
[02:39:46.074 --> 02:39:48.838]  Well, it's sort of its own form of Dark Ages, potentially.
[02:39:48.838 --> 02:39:54.265]  In other words, it's very much a transitional time period where either freedom is going to succeed or authoritarianism is going to succeed.
[02:39:54.785 --> 02:39:57.567]  And you're seeing it at a broad scale and in multiple contexts.
[02:39:57.567 --> 02:40:15.719]  So you have a big tech engines that are trying to build a Chinese model, who really think the Chinese were probably going to dominate in 20, 20, 30 years, and who are building their big tech model for a social media control, censorship and shaming strategies, the social credit attributes that Ben is talking about, that was going to be worldwide and global.
[02:40:15.719 --> 02:40:20.182]  And it's fighting back against the Chinese model for the future of the United States and the future of the world.
[02:40:20.182 --> 02:40:23.304]  And so this is the key transitional time period where either they win or we win.
[02:40:23.724 --> 02:40:38.056]  And that's why they're doubling down, that's why they're intensifying their attacks, that's why they're going after InfoWars and you in particular, because they need to be able to destabilize and shut down the independent free press in the country that is their true threat to their authoritarian objectives.
[02:40:38.056 --> 02:40:43.360]  Is the left, if they get defeated, are going to be known like real Nazis, like embarrassed they were ever Nazis?
[02:40:43.360 --> 02:40:44.541]  Because again, the average leftist
[02:40:45.001 --> 02:40:47.564]  They go, yeah, we know we're making it up.
[02:40:47.564 --> 02:40:49.226]  We're going to get you and kill you.
[02:40:49.226 --> 02:40:55.474]  I mean, they've converted the average leftist to consciously knowing it's all a fraud, loving the Jesse Smollett stage stuff.
[02:40:55.474 --> 02:40:57.056]  Maddie got caught.
[02:40:57.056 --> 02:41:02.683]  Now there's still bleeding heart liberals that mean well, but a lot of them have now converted to, no, we're the ruling class.
[02:41:03.223 --> 02:41:03.603]  Exactly.
[02:41:03.603 --> 02:41:06.405]  They want control of thought, control of ideas, control of speech.
[02:41:06.405 --> 02:41:17.170]  And when you listen to what Ben is talking about, where the social credit system is labeling people, and labeling people in such a way that they can't get employment, can't have successful mechanisms, really it's the old Nazi numbering system.
[02:41:17.170 --> 02:41:19.311]  They're just putting numbers on people inside of their arms.
[02:41:19.311 --> 02:41:20.811]  Incredible discrimination.
[02:41:20.811 --> 02:41:21.412]  Precisely.
[02:41:21.412 --> 02:41:27.295]  But you know, in law, don't we really have laws against discrimination against people's politics?
[02:41:27.295 --> 02:41:29.796]  Because, you know, they say we don't, but I mean, is there mechanisms?
[02:41:30.416 --> 02:41:37.000]  There should be, and there's supposed to be, and there's some laws that on paper protect us, but unfortunately the courts have too frequently and too often been closed to it.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:49.587]  So we have, because of the way the lawfare system has worked, too much of the judicial branch shares the same ideological approach as the left, and that's causing hindrances in being able to achieve a positive outcome for the court system.
[02:41:49.587 --> 02:41:53.829]  So it's going to create political pressure in the court of public opinion to make sure the law reflects what it should be.
[02:41:53.829 --> 02:41:56.010]  I'll explain how bad it is.
[02:41:56.010 --> 02:41:57.431]  This weekend I went into a restaurant.
[02:41:59.460 --> 02:42:10.813]  Slash Bar, nice little place, looked nice, with my wife and Rob Dew, and we were there, and some of the patrons came over and said, oh, you're Alex Jones!
[02:42:10.813 --> 02:42:15.578]  And I shook their hand and everything, and they were Beto supporters, and I said, that's fine.
[02:42:15.578 --> 02:42:19.382]  And then the manager comes over and says, I want you to leave.
[02:42:20.464 --> 02:42:20.824]  Absolutely.
[02:42:20.824 --> 02:42:31.211]  They literally want to put, effectively, numbers on people's arms to control whether they have access to the banking system, social media, the ability to express speech, the ability to have dinner out.
[02:42:43.539 --> 02:42:44.640]  That's the effect of what they're doing.
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:47.143]  Of course, you've been out there with me and most folks are big fans.
[02:42:47.143 --> 02:42:47.923]  Oh, of course.
[02:42:47.923 --> 02:42:50.886]  But still, these little isolated pockets, just put a sign on your door that we're not welcome.
[02:42:50.886 --> 02:42:52.107]  We want you to go bankrupt.
[02:42:52.107 --> 02:42:52.428]  We hate you.
[02:42:55.074 --> 02:42:57.336]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:42:57.336 --> 02:42:59.077]  There is no set stasis.
[02:42:59.077 --> 02:43:00.318]  There is no managed system.
[02:43:00.318 --> 02:43:01.980]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:05.182]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[02:43:05.182 --> 02:43:08.545]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:43:08.545 --> 02:43:09.786]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[02:43:09.786 --> 02:43:10.506]  We'll be here forever.
[02:43:10.506 --> 02:43:11.847]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:43:11.847 --> 02:43:18.733]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[02:43:18.733 --> 02:43:19.293]  We made it.
[02:43:19.293 --> 02:43:21.455]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:43:21.455 --> 02:43:23.277]  God's got a big war for you, Revy.
[02:43:23.277 --> 02:43:23.637]  And so
[02:43:23.837 --> 02:43:30.303]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:43:30.303 --> 02:43:35.367]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:43:35.367 --> 02:43:38.230]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:43:38.230 --> 02:43:40.612]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:43:40.612 --> 02:43:44.115]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master builder.
[02:43:44.115 --> 02:43:45.156]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:43:45.396 --> 02:43:48.519]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[02:43:48.519 --> 02:43:49.680]  Not these devil worshippers.
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:52.542]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:43:52.542 --> 02:43:53.623]  I want life!
[02:43:53.623 --> 02:43:54.944]  I want Jesus!
[02:43:54.944 --> 02:44:00.028]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.

[02:45:07.752 --> 02:45:11.574]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:45:11.574 --> 02:45:19.619]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:45:20.559 --> 02:45:23.360]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[02:45:23.360 --> 02:45:30.601]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[02:45:30.601 --> 02:45:34.562]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[02:45:34.562 --> 02:45:40.523]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[02:45:40.523 --> 02:45:43.544]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[02:45:43.544 --> 02:45:45.044]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[02:45:45.044 --> 02:45:48.085]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[02:45:56.045 --> 02:45:58.706]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[02:45:58.706 --> 02:46:05.070]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[02:46:05.070 --> 02:46:07.031]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[02:46:07.031 --> 02:46:13.395]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[02:46:13.675 --> 02:46:19.860]  Made with ancient ingredients used for thousands of years, Happies can help you take back the day.

[02:46:34.210 --> 02:46:39.254]  With powerful ingredients combined to help support the mind and body, Happies
[02:46:39.494 --> 02:46:42.016]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:12.722 --> 02:47:13.623]  You found it!
[02:47:13.623 --> 02:47:17.064]  The number one most demonized attack lied about broadcast in the world.
[02:47:17.064 --> 02:47:21.627]  It's where a platform for everybody to be able to stand up and tell the truth and speak out.
[02:47:21.627 --> 02:47:24.368]  Bunch of exclusives I'm going to cover in the first two segments of the next hour.
[02:47:24.368 --> 02:47:26.930]  One of them's on mfulwars.com.
[02:47:26.930 --> 02:47:28.130]  Mfulwars exclusive video.
[02:47:28.130 --> 02:47:32.052]  Border Patrol being used as illegal immigrant Uber service.
[02:47:32.052 --> 02:47:37.495]  And then some of the folks from, well, not the Border Patrol, but some of the folks at the quote, Christian Church.
[02:47:37.495 --> 02:47:40.077]  They say, you don't show these people.
[02:47:40.077 --> 02:47:41.878]  The smugglers might come after them.
[02:47:43.337 --> 02:47:44.958]  Wait a minute, they're being smuggled in.
[02:47:44.958 --> 02:47:47.901]  They paid smugglers to get here.
[02:47:47.901 --> 02:47:50.943]  It's on newswars.com as well.
[02:47:50.943 --> 02:47:55.406]  And again, TV networks rejecting ads for anti-abortion movie that are G-rated.
[02:47:55.406 --> 02:47:57.408]  Twitter blocking it.
[02:47:57.408 --> 02:48:03.733]  Mainline MD doctors with Facebooks about vaccine damage and the fact that vaccines can really hurt you.
[02:48:03.733 --> 02:48:04.573]  The inserts say it.
[02:48:04.573 --> 02:48:06.034]  They're all being banned.
[02:48:06.034 --> 02:48:09.317]  So you can see how this has gone into total overdrive.
[02:48:11.101 --> 02:48:16.848]  Then they use me as a straw man and lie about what I've said and done, but to make the whole debate about me?
[02:48:18.530 --> 02:48:40.844]  And in the process, I just get more and more and more and more famous, but in this crazy world where what I actually say has trouble getting out, gets out on these local radio stations, it gets out at Infowars.com, but the average person is so habituated to Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube, they go, man, I used to love your show, used to watch it every day on YouTube, used to watch it every day on iTunes, or listen, shag your shows off the air.
[02:48:40.844 --> 02:48:44.226]  They believe Main Street, and I go, I'm on the air every day, Infowars.com.
[02:48:45.174 --> 02:48:47.215]  So Alex Jones isn't dead.
[02:48:47.215 --> 02:48:48.716]  The free press isn't dead.
[02:48:48.716 --> 02:48:50.577]  Free speech isn't a crime.
[02:48:50.577 --> 02:48:55.560]  And that's why those of you that are smart enough to know the show's still on the air have to keep spreading the word.
[02:48:55.560 --> 02:48:58.422]  In ways, the hardcore audience has gotten bigger.
[02:48:58.422 --> 02:49:01.503]  And Congress, the military's listening, and people all over the world are listening.
[02:49:01.503 --> 02:49:03.565]  People know this is a verboten program.
[02:49:03.565 --> 02:49:10.088]  But to the general public that kind of just thinks of things as channels, they get habituated to the channel they go to.
[02:49:10.088 --> 02:49:14.030]  And they don't hear it there anymore, on like iHeartRadio or wherever.
[02:49:14.030 --> 02:49:14.731]  We're taking it on everywhere.
[02:49:16.015 --> 02:49:19.016]  Cause you know, that's the move, that's what you do, yeah!
[02:49:19.016 --> 02:49:20.476]  He's getting banned, we're gonna do it too.
[02:49:20.476 --> 02:49:24.637]  And you're like, wow, iHeartRadio, that's Clear Channel.
[02:49:24.637 --> 02:49:26.218]  There's leftists in everywhere.
[02:49:26.218 --> 02:49:33.060]  Fox News, I'm told, by a high-level Fox host, the biggest there are, that Alex, you understand, 80% of the staff are leftists.
[02:49:35.317 --> 02:49:37.319]  They've taken over.
[02:49:37.319 --> 02:49:47.168]  It's just what he was saying earlier, Bob Barnes, is they get in key positions like they did with Ben Garrison to block him out of business when he started doing his own private...
[02:49:48.891 --> 02:49:50.552]  So, again, it's right.
[02:49:50.552 --> 02:50:00.098]  It's the direct patronage of people like you to go to Graphics.com and get a poster or to go to Infomercial.com and get a book.
[02:50:00.098 --> 02:50:02.300]  That's how this is happening.
[02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:05.081]  And it's nip and tuck for us, I can tell you.
[02:50:05.081 --> 02:50:08.403]  So, in closing, Ben, I really appreciate you joining us.
[02:50:08.403 --> 02:50:13.527]  And it was great when you came to Austin and hung out with us in Sabo.
[02:50:13.527 --> 02:50:15.348]  And I do want to do some exciting things in the future.
[02:50:15.348 --> 02:50:16.849]  I do want to carry your new book when it comes out.
[02:50:17.869 --> 02:50:34.153]  But again, getting back to Trump, I like a lot of what he's doing, but hopefully you can do a cartoon, if you think of a good way to do it, where he's handling all this other stuff great, but he's leaving this one area open of the censorship.
[02:50:34.153 --> 02:50:37.193]  Well, you know, I support Trump not because he's perfect.
[02:50:37.193 --> 02:50:38.674]  He's not perfect.
[02:50:38.674 --> 02:50:42.775]  I support him because he might be our last best hope to turn things around.
[02:50:42.775 --> 02:50:43.695]  I mean,
[02:50:45.252 --> 02:50:47.453]  I would like to see him do a lot more.
[02:50:47.453 --> 02:50:51.554]  I mean, let's pardon Assange.
[02:50:51.554 --> 02:50:54.735]  Let's overturn the Patriot Act along with Obamacare.
[02:50:54.735 --> 02:50:58.957]  I mean, he could do a lot more than he's done, but the cornerstone is the wall.
[02:50:58.957 --> 02:51:00.757]  We have to have the wall.
[02:51:00.757 --> 02:51:06.419]  I mean, I was watching Bill and Marty the other night, and Bill and Marty says, oh, these are just kind people who want to come up here and pick our lettuce.
[02:51:06.419 --> 02:51:07.159]  What's wrong with that?
[02:51:07.159 --> 02:51:11.581]  Well, they also, I read a statistic that they cost the country
[02:51:12.975 --> 02:51:19.556]  I think it was $115 billion per year in social costs and prisons and everything else.
[02:51:19.556 --> 02:51:21.517]  So they're coming up here to get free stuff.
[02:51:21.517 --> 02:51:25.777]  They're coming up here so they could vote, take away our guns and our liberties.
[02:51:25.777 --> 02:51:26.818]  Oh yeah.
[02:51:26.818 --> 02:51:28.178]  It boils down to this.
[02:51:28.178 --> 02:51:30.098]  They're calling us extremists now.
[02:51:30.098 --> 02:51:31.539]  I get called extremists all the time.
[02:51:31.539 --> 02:51:37.080]  I lost a lot of my liberal friends because they think I'm mean, because I don't want to allow all these people in here.
[02:51:37.080 --> 02:51:39.120]  And somehow that makes me a hater.
[02:51:39.884 --> 02:51:42.526]  And they don't even know that Latin America has collapsed.
[02:51:42.526 --> 02:51:46.168]  They don't understand how deadly dangerous this is.
[02:51:46.168 --> 02:51:53.913]  Well, my thing is, I like that quote by Goldwater, he said, extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.
[02:51:53.913 --> 02:51:57.715]  So I'm going to stay as, I'll be an extremist in the defense of liberty.
[02:51:57.715 --> 02:52:00.837]  But the thing, here's what it boils down to, Alex.
[02:52:01.622 --> 02:52:07.285]  Is my old liberal friends see the world, they see themselves as good people.
[02:52:07.285 --> 02:52:08.666]  They're doing good in the world.
[02:52:08.666 --> 02:52:17.730]  They want government to go out and do their bidding, which is to solve the world's problem and bring about a utopia.
[02:52:17.730 --> 02:52:20.751]  But this Star Trek-like utopia can't happen.
[02:52:20.751 --> 02:52:23.673]  Instead, what they deliver is a Mad Max dystopian
[02:52:25.466 --> 02:52:36.876]  And that's where we're heading if we continue to let these egalitarian strains of let's get the government is wise, they're intelligent, they're so helpful, they love us and they want to help people.
[02:52:36.876 --> 02:52:43.963]  No, we conservatives see government as something dangerous, something that tends to keep growing and get more corrupt.
[02:52:43.963 --> 02:52:48.447]  And they steal from the hardworking man.
[02:52:48.447 --> 02:52:50.889]  The government doesn't produce anything, they just take.
[02:52:51.647 --> 02:53:02.095]  So that is what I want to try to do with my cartoons, is to try to get people to realize that, hey, government has gotten so big and out of control.
[02:53:02.095 --> 02:53:09.321]  And my next big worry is going to be mandatory vaccines and if they can control your health, which they already do to a large degree.
[02:53:09.321 --> 02:53:12.724]  I mean, they got the fluoride in the water and you breathe the chemtrails and they
[02:53:13.923 --> 02:53:27.026]  I guess they call it global engineering now, but if they can inject mercury and aluminum directly into your brain and then simultaneously make sure that you can't sell raw milk, well, it's over.
[02:53:27.026 --> 02:53:30.927]  We have to make sure that we have control over our own bodies.
[02:53:30.927 --> 02:53:36.008]  And so I'm going to draw more cartoons that have to do with this vaccination abuse that we see.
[02:53:36.969 --> 02:53:44.254]  So that's my line of the sand, and to take your paraphrase, government is not reason, it is not eloquence.
[02:53:44.254 --> 02:53:47.877]  It is force, like fire is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[02:53:47.877 --> 02:53:51.660]  Never, for a moment, should it be left to irresponsible action.
[02:53:53.032 --> 02:53:58.353]  Founding Fathers knew this very well, and that's why you don't see the word democracy in our Constitution.
[02:53:58.353 --> 02:54:03.495]  And yet, when you turn on the news, that's all you hear from these commentators is, our democracy, our democracy.
[02:54:03.495 --> 02:54:07.776]  They're really saying, our socialism, our socialism, our socialism.
[02:54:07.776 --> 02:54:11.337]  That's what they're driving hard to the hoop to bring about, is socialism.
[02:54:11.337 --> 02:54:17.279]  And, you know, I'm going to draw all the cartoons I can to speak out in socialism in all its forms.
[02:54:17.279 --> 02:54:18.779]  There is no good form of socialism.
[02:54:19.688 --> 02:54:21.691]  Sweden is not a socialist country.
[02:54:21.691 --> 02:54:22.892]  It's a heavily taxed country.
[02:54:22.892 --> 02:54:24.534]  But they say, well, let's be like Sweden.
[02:54:24.534 --> 02:54:25.295]  They're socialists.
[02:54:25.295 --> 02:54:26.356]  Why can't we be socialists?
[02:54:26.356 --> 02:54:29.320]  And they're going to collapse within a few years.
[02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:29.700]  It will.
[02:54:29.700 --> 02:54:36.389]  It always leads to, it ends up leading to murder and death and death of millions.
[02:54:36.389 --> 02:54:37.730]  It always leads to lazy people.
[02:54:40.185 --> 02:54:41.246]  Ben, you are awesome.
[02:54:41.246 --> 02:54:41.926]  God bless you.
[02:54:41.926 --> 02:54:42.507]  Let's talk.
[02:54:42.507 --> 02:54:44.048]  I'm going to get Tim or one of the crew to call you.
[02:54:44.048 --> 02:54:47.430]  I want to order a whole bunch of that big book, because I liked your other book we sold.
[02:54:47.430 --> 02:54:51.053]  But I said, like a year ago, you want to put on a big coffee table.
[02:54:51.053 --> 02:54:52.654]  And you said, I'm doing just that.
[02:54:52.654 --> 02:54:53.975]  So is this new book a big old book?
[02:54:55.538 --> 02:55:03.682]  It's going to be 9 by 12 and we've already upgraded it to hardcover and thicker, glossy, because we keep people keep pre-ordering the book.
[02:55:03.682 --> 02:55:05.103]  It's on Indiegogo.
[02:55:05.103 --> 02:55:08.445]  I mean, I couldn't afford to print out a book that cost that much.
[02:55:08.445 --> 02:55:09.486]  Now there's so much interest.
[02:55:09.486 --> 02:55:14.348]  Well, that's why I was saying earlier, I never got around to it, that I could finance you doing it because I want you to be able to print 50,000 of these.
[02:55:14.348 --> 02:55:15.489]  We're going to talk soon, Ben.
[02:55:15.489 --> 02:55:17.410]  God bless you and take care of my friend.
[02:55:18.203 --> 02:55:19.404]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:55:19.404 --> 02:55:20.826]  Alright, there goes Ben Garrison.
[02:55:20.826 --> 02:55:24.649]  And I'm not kidding, I'm not kissing his butt.
[02:55:24.649 --> 02:55:28.353]  He was already a guy that did like magazine covers, major stuff for newspapers.
[02:55:28.353 --> 02:55:29.394]  I mean, he was a top guy.
[02:55:29.394 --> 02:55:32.657]  I've already seen his work many times.
[02:55:32.657 --> 02:55:39.464]  In the last decade, he has become the number one graphics person in the world.
[02:55:39.464 --> 02:55:41.025]  I mean, you never see anybody's stuff, really.
[02:55:41.025 --> 02:55:41.506]  It's all him.
[02:55:43.106 --> 02:55:51.253]  So you can get his 2016 presidential election collection by Ben Garrison at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:55:51.253 --> 02:55:52.754]  But I can't wait till his new one comes out.
[02:55:52.754 --> 02:55:57.178]  I want to push that heavily because I really pushed him to put out a big coffee table book.
[02:55:57.178 --> 02:56:04.664]  Like so many people like Mark Dyson, they don't even have the money to do a 10,000 print with a publisher or to go out to a printer.
[02:56:04.664 --> 02:56:08.808]  They just do it where it's print on demand and then the artist gets almost nothing.
[02:56:09.850 --> 02:56:15.114]  So, but I'm glad that he's got enough pre-orders to be able to even upgrade the quality, see?
[02:56:15.114 --> 02:56:17.656]  As people pre-ordered it, he's even able to upgrade the quality.
[02:56:17.656 --> 02:56:20.939]  That's how this works, is, it's like a plant.
[02:56:20.939 --> 02:56:26.644]  You put water on it, you give it, you know, give it oxygen, you give it carbon dioxide, you give it sunlight, it lives.
[02:56:26.644 --> 02:56:27.425]  You don't, it dies.
[02:56:27.425 --> 02:56:30.967]  That's why I tell the listeners.
[02:56:30.967 --> 02:56:32.569]  Over the years, I've maybe plugged once an hour.
[02:56:32.569 --> 02:56:33.890]  Notice I'm plugging like twice an hour.
[02:56:35.578 --> 02:56:39.731]  And that's because we need the funding in the face of all these lawsuits.
[02:56:42.418 --> 02:56:43.819]  Two lawsuits thrown out last week.
[02:56:43.819 --> 02:57:04.877]  One in Cleveland over the flag burning where we got blamed for stuff we didn't do and I'm not going to get into it all but the point is that we had folks covering a flag burning and then a bunch of melee happened and we were obviously not for burning the flag and it just went sideways but that all got dropped and then half the suit in Virginia got cut out and then the next phase hopefully the rest will get cut out but that's how those things work.
[02:57:04.877 --> 02:57:05.877]  But you don't hear that we've had
[02:57:06.918 --> 02:57:10.942]  Sixteen lawsuits thrown out in a year and a half at the cost of three million dollars.
[02:57:10.942 --> 02:57:12.564]  Yeah, three million dollars.
[02:57:12.564 --> 02:57:13.985]  You don't hear that.
[02:57:13.985 --> 02:57:18.930]  You hear that, oh, Alex Jones is, you know, losing, he's going under.
[02:57:18.930 --> 02:57:20.592]  They want to make us losers.
[02:57:20.592 --> 02:57:21.072]  They want to have wins.
[02:57:22.133 --> 02:57:25.575]  You understand, that's three million dollars, not three million dollars a product sold.
[02:57:25.575 --> 02:57:27.635]  Three million dollars a product is like a million and a half dollars.
[02:57:27.635 --> 02:57:30.157]  Then you gotta spend that to run the operation.
[02:57:30.157 --> 02:57:33.318]  Three million is three million money we lost to not be able to expand.
[02:57:33.318 --> 02:57:36.519]  We didn't go 24 hours a day last year because of that.
[02:57:36.519 --> 02:57:44.703]  I want the money in here to go to the next level, so please get a t-shirt, get a book, sign up for AutoShip so we can do it and rub it in the face of these people.

[02:58:46.104 --> 02:58:48.465]  We all know the importance of fish oils.

[02:59:48.687 --> 02:59:51.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:07.899 --> 03:00:15.764]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas.
[03:00:15.764 --> 03:00:17.525]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:52.671 --> 03:00:59.778]  The globalists and tyrants everywhere seek control, dumb down masses so they can play God.
[03:00:59.778 --> 03:01:15.393]  And the American system of true rugged individualism, the wild wild west, everything we've been through, our entire history, beating the British Empire when no one else had ever done it up until that time, and it was ragtag forces that did it, is the stuff of legend.
[03:01:16.536 --> 03:01:26.679]  And that's why the globalists want to break up our families and demoralize us and give us false histories about our country so that they can break us down and control us.
[03:01:26.679 --> 03:01:37.143]  It's classic military tactics that when you occupy a nation and the people aren't giving up, you demoralize them, you teach them that they're bad people, you turn them against each other.
[03:01:38.953 --> 03:01:40.994]  But humanity is smarter than that.
[03:01:40.994 --> 03:02:06.487]  Despite all the cultural attacks, all the biological attacks, all the GMO, all the vaccines, all of it, still humanity is beginning to awaken, not just here, but from Brazil, to Japan, to the coast of Spain, and Catalonia, to the great folks in Greece, right through Europe,
[03:02:08.740 --> 03:02:11.701]  In France and into the UK and Canada.
[03:02:11.701 --> 03:02:17.723]  And so the authoritarians are cracking down to make us submit and break our will.
[03:02:17.723 --> 03:02:21.644]  But fighting back is not something that's a labor.
[03:02:21.644 --> 03:02:24.225]  It's a pleasure.
[03:02:24.225 --> 03:02:29.227]  And the tighter they squeeze, the more people are going to wake up and resist.
[03:02:29.227 --> 03:02:31.108]  But it's an incredibly dangerous time as well.
[03:02:31.108 --> 03:02:37.450]  And that's why listeners and viewers have to understand that this is
[03:02:39.062 --> 03:02:41.004]  Very, very close.
[03:02:41.004 --> 03:03:01.502]  They are attacking and savagely destroying and stabbing, you know, the president of Brazil in the stomach and trying to destroy the Trump family and coming after me and trying to defeat anybody they can ahead of major moves they're going to pull in the next year.
[03:03:01.502 --> 03:03:04.025]  This is the most critical time in human development.
[03:03:04.025 --> 03:03:04.945]  Everybody sees it.
[03:03:04.945 --> 03:03:05.426]  They feel it.
[03:03:06.869 --> 03:03:11.534]  And that's why I sit up here, never crying wolf, saying we're under attack, we need your support.
[03:03:11.534 --> 03:03:18.022]  And you've always rallied, you've always supported, but over time, believe me, I get sick of it.
[03:03:18.022 --> 03:03:23.307]  I love fighting the gloveless, but I don't like having to sit up here and ask for your support.
[03:03:23.307 --> 03:03:28.233]  So when I do it, I make sure it's something you really need, so I feel good about pushing it.
[03:03:31.445 --> 03:03:35.446]  Gosh, if I was selling, you know, tickets to Vegas to go gambling, I'd think I'd jump off a cliff.
[03:03:35.446 --> 03:03:37.926]  But I'm promoting water filtration for you and your children.
[03:03:37.926 --> 03:03:38.947]  That's a must.
[03:03:38.947 --> 03:03:41.287]  All the stuff in the water table, I'm promoting air filtration.
[03:03:41.287 --> 03:03:48.129]  I'm promoting non-GMO heirloom seeds that are great to plant, whether you live in the city or you're out in the countryside.
[03:03:48.129 --> 03:03:49.349]  I promote great supplements.
[03:03:49.349 --> 03:03:51.310]  I promote t-shirts.
[03:03:51.310 --> 03:03:52.870]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[03:03:54.212 --> 03:03:56.634]  Because I'm beyond superstitious.
[03:03:56.634 --> 03:03:57.715]  I am a superstition.
[03:03:57.715 --> 03:03:59.596]  You know what I mean?
[03:03:59.596 --> 03:04:00.817]  I'm not superstitious.
[03:04:00.817 --> 03:04:02.098]  I'm a superstition.
[03:04:02.098 --> 03:04:03.159]  That's something I just coined.
[03:04:03.159 --> 03:04:08.083]  I just automatically can't do things that are bad to people.
[03:04:08.083 --> 03:04:10.965]  And when I am bad, I feel really sorry for it.
[03:04:10.965 --> 03:04:13.567]  And so you're getting a straight shoot here.
[03:04:13.567 --> 03:04:21.213]  And we've got only a few days left of 50 to 60% off and store-wide free shipping and double Patriot points and so much more.
[03:04:21.213 --> 03:04:22.114]  And at these prices,
[03:04:23.544 --> 03:04:28.185]  We didn't really make that much money off of it, but people like the product so much it ends up later than reordering, so it's worth it.
[03:04:28.185 --> 03:04:33.547]  But just, please take action, and know you couldn't put your dollars down.
[03:04:33.547 --> 03:04:37.388]  You couldn't put your money down somewhere to get better products that go to a better cause.
[03:04:37.388 --> 03:04:40.169]  It's a win-win, and you're crazy.
[03:04:40.169 --> 03:04:45.450]  If you don't, get the X2, or get the Brain Force, or get the Wake of America Coffee, and then sign up for AutoShip.
[03:04:45.450 --> 03:04:46.150]  We need your help.
[03:04:46.150 --> 03:04:49.131]  I want to thank you all that have, and encourage those that haven't.
[03:04:49.131 --> 03:04:50.312]  What are you thinking, man?
[03:04:50.312 --> 03:04:51.552]  We need your help right now.
[03:04:53.931 --> 03:04:59.133]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:04:59.133 --> 03:05:07.696]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:05:07.696 --> 03:05:10.677]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:05:10.677 --> 03:05:12.417]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:05:12.417 --> 03:05:18.679]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[03:05:20.780 --> 03:05:26.102]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[03:05:26.102 --> 03:05:29.064]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:05:29.064 --> 03:05:32.665]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:05:32.665 --> 03:05:36.967]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:05:36.967 --> 03:05:38.808]  I've got two in my home.
[03:05:38.808 --> 03:05:44.890]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:05:44.890 --> 03:05:45.731]  Don't live
[03:05:46.571 --> 03:05:50.274]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[03:05:50.274 --> 03:06:05.565]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:05.565 --> 03:06:11.950]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:32.492 --> 03:06:35.174]  Gerald Salente is loaded for bear.
[03:06:35.174 --> 03:06:37.756]  Now, love is in the studio.
[03:06:37.756 --> 03:06:39.137]  He'll be on in T-minus 10 minutes.
[03:06:39.137 --> 03:06:42.900]  Listen to that.
[03:06:42.900 --> 03:06:43.700]  He's got a hammer right there.
[03:06:43.700 --> 03:06:46.342]  That is some guitar power.
[03:06:46.342 --> 03:06:48.083]  Woo!
[03:06:48.083 --> 03:06:49.204]  It's like talking to him.
[03:06:49.204 --> 03:06:49.805]  Talking to your soul.
[03:07:07.153 --> 03:07:09.895]  He's puttin' motor drive!
[03:07:09.895 --> 03:07:14.998]  Alright, let's get into it.
[03:07:14.998 --> 03:07:21.482]  Alright, here it is.
[03:07:21.482 --> 03:07:24.323]  This is such a critical article.
[03:07:24.323 --> 03:07:25.624]  And such a critical issue.
[03:07:25.624 --> 03:07:33.369]  And people that are ignorant, and I don't mean that in a pleasurable way, like you ignorant, conservatives and libertarians and people that I know,
[03:07:35.231 --> 03:07:38.834]  Watch some folks out there do cheap shots on the president.
[03:07:38.834 --> 03:07:45.298]  And if the president's doing something wrong, I'm the first to say, get on his butt, because he actually listens, which is very refreshing.
[03:07:45.298 --> 03:07:50.282]  I mean, Garrison earlier, I'm like, please make cartoons telling Trump to stop the censorship.
[03:07:50.282 --> 03:07:51.943]  He goes, well, Trump's trying hard.
[03:07:51.943 --> 03:07:54.024]  I know he needs the stimulus.
[03:07:54.024 --> 03:07:59.308]  And believe me, he's seeing your cartoons, Garrison.
[03:07:59.308 --> 03:08:01.069]  It's a lot of fire under Trump's butt.
[03:08:01.069 --> 03:08:02.611]  He's got a lot of people distracting him.
[03:08:03.464 --> 03:08:05.464]  And the globalists are obsessed with stopping people from getting to him.
[03:08:05.464 --> 03:08:08.385]  So, when I tell you this, it's not an attack on Trump.
[03:08:08.385 --> 03:08:10.946]  He's trying to fix this.
[03:08:10.946 --> 03:08:14.806]  But yes, people are like the Border Patrol are a bunch of traitors.
[03:08:14.806 --> 03:08:18.307]  Why, they're releasing 5,000 people a day!
[03:08:18.307 --> 03:08:22.068]  That was last month.
[03:08:22.068 --> 03:08:27.149]  Okay, well, how about I drop off 500 people at your house and see how you take care of them?
[03:08:28.956 --> 03:08:30.658]  We played the reports last night from the Border Patrol.
[03:08:30.658 --> 03:08:33.622]  They're saying red alert, S.O.S.
[03:08:33.622 --> 03:08:36.305]  We normally get 3,000 people max in McAllen a day.
[03:08:36.305 --> 03:08:39.328]  3,000's our emergency level.
[03:08:39.328 --> 03:08:43.073]  4,000's unheard of in El Paso.
[03:08:43.073 --> 03:08:45.055]  There was 12,000 yesterday.
[03:08:45.055 --> 03:08:45.476]  There's 15,000 today.
[03:08:49.677 --> 03:08:55.501]  And the media's there going, look, they've got them held behind fences under rainy underpasses.
[03:08:55.501 --> 03:08:59.764]  They don't have the vans, the trucks, the detention facilities.
[03:08:59.764 --> 03:09:02.345]  They broke the border!
[03:09:02.345 --> 03:09:07.429]  I don't want to panic people, and Trump's trying to fix it, but our country's being broke right now.
[03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:09.430]  Well, that Trump isn't doing anything.
[03:09:12.785 --> 03:09:15.067]  The judges and the federal laws block it.
[03:09:15.067 --> 03:09:16.108]  He's trying to get the laws changed.
[03:09:16.108 --> 03:09:17.810]  He declared an emergency.
[03:09:17.810 --> 03:09:20.653]  He put the military down there to help people.
[03:09:20.653 --> 03:09:27.320]  And he's trying to get ready for the optics, which is in Rex 84, for the military to put people on military bases.
[03:09:27.320 --> 03:09:29.522]  Either that or it's going to be on the streets.
[03:09:29.522 --> 03:09:32.625]  They are collapsing the third world right now.
[03:09:32.625 --> 03:09:35.247]  Huge areas of South Texas are now unlivable.
[03:09:36.127 --> 03:09:37.707]  By the way, it's like 90% Hispanic.
[03:09:37.707 --> 03:09:39.828]  They're begging it to stop.
[03:09:39.828 --> 03:09:47.009]  You try, in some count of a thousand, having 5, 10,000, 20,000 illegals wandering around, breaking into your garage, raping your daughter.
[03:09:47.009 --> 03:09:51.230]  80% of the women that are brought up throughout Mexico get raped.
[03:09:51.230 --> 03:09:52.271]  Amnesty International.
[03:09:52.271 --> 03:09:56.792]  It's hell!
[03:09:56.792 --> 03:10:00.912]  And Trump's cutting funding to Central America.
[03:10:00.912 --> 03:10:03.133]  He's about to cut funding to Mexico unless they control it.
[03:10:04.246 --> 03:10:08.111]  They are, Latin America is collapsing.
[03:10:08.111 --> 03:10:12.497]  Central America is in civil war.
[03:10:12.497 --> 03:10:14.740]  And the UN now is running this entire thing.
[03:10:16.656 --> 03:10:22.619]  So, under Obama, he started this, the encouragement, and even the Washington Post admitted thousands of children disappeared into sex slavery.
[03:10:22.619 --> 03:10:26.402]  Unaccompanied kids with men, with no IDs, little girls.
[03:10:26.402 --> 03:10:29.263]  Some cases, like one coyote with eight little girls.
[03:10:29.263 --> 03:10:30.924]  Some of them age five.
[03:10:30.924 --> 03:10:36.547]  And then they just disappear into Democrat vans and are shipped off to who the hell knows where.
[03:10:36.547 --> 03:10:39.129]  And then a famous reporter shoots this video.
[03:10:39.129 --> 03:10:43.031]  She's doing it on her own, not where she works.
[03:10:43.031 --> 03:10:44.592]  And she sends us this footage.
[03:10:46.889 --> 03:10:51.698]  Because she's scared her own network won't even put it on.
[03:10:51.698 --> 03:10:53.842]  And it's just like chopped liver.
[03:10:53.842 --> 03:10:55.065]  Shut on her phone.
[03:10:55.065 --> 03:10:57.429]  This is Catholic Charities RGV.
[03:10:58.894 --> 03:11:03.558]  You got people saying, don't videotape the Border Patrol pulling up because they don't know where to keep it.
[03:11:03.558 --> 03:11:05.199]  The Democrats go, don't worry.
[03:11:05.199 --> 03:11:08.922]  You bring the illegal aliens that we told come here that you don't have room for.
[03:11:08.922 --> 03:11:10.263]  You bring them to our church.
[03:11:10.263 --> 03:11:11.424]  And who the hell knows?
[03:11:11.424 --> 03:11:13.925]  Of course, they don't want footage of the kids.
[03:11:13.925 --> 03:11:15.467]  Oh, to stop smugglers, right.
[03:11:15.467 --> 03:11:18.069]  So there's no record of these little kids.
[03:11:18.069 --> 03:11:19.209]  They started the whole show with this.
[03:11:19.209 --> 03:11:20.871]  This is so bombshell.
[03:11:21.988 --> 03:11:23.509]  It's on NewsWars.com.
[03:11:23.509 --> 03:11:25.390]  That doesn't get censored as much.
[03:11:25.390 --> 03:11:26.271]  Share that link.
[03:11:26.271 --> 03:11:27.752]  NewsWars.com.
[03:11:27.752 --> 03:11:29.653]  InfoWars exclusive video.
[03:11:29.653 --> 03:11:32.615]  Border Patrol being used as illegal immigrant Uber service.
[03:11:32.615 --> 03:11:34.095]  It's worse than that.
[03:11:34.095 --> 03:11:37.798]  Rob Newstate up till midnight getting this out last night with Jamie White and the rest of the crew.
[03:11:37.798 --> 03:11:41.660]  I'm not bitching, I'm just saying we're ragtag, man.
[03:11:41.660 --> 03:11:44.202]  We're working seven days a week, a lot of us.
[03:11:44.202 --> 03:11:46.643]  Eighteen hours a day because it's our moral responsibility.
[03:11:46.643 --> 03:11:49.145]  We get something like this, we don't even get to see our kids.
[03:11:51.323 --> 03:11:53.384]  Let me get this damn article out.
[03:11:53.384 --> 03:11:59.387]  What it should say is, witness Border Patrol engaged in child smuggling under federal law.
[03:11:59.387 --> 03:12:00.268]  Think the Border Patrol's happy?
[03:12:00.268 --> 03:12:04.410]  They're the ones who told us about it.
[03:12:04.410 --> 03:12:05.750]  They're beside themselves.
[03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:08.352]  But if they quit, it totally collapses.
[03:12:08.352 --> 03:12:11.813]  So then they have to be involved in a lesser evil to stop the total collapse.
[03:12:11.813 --> 03:12:12.734]  You see how that works?
[03:12:14.397 --> 03:12:16.858]  Turns out there are lesser evils in this world.
[03:12:16.858 --> 03:12:24.139]  But what we need to do is stop Congress and Beto and all these traitors that are literally aiding and abetting this.
[03:12:24.139 --> 03:12:26.820]  Here's the censored video only at NewsWars.com.
[03:12:26.820 --> 03:12:27.260]  Here it is.
[03:12:27.260 --> 03:12:35.362]  You cannot take pictures of this, Mayor.
[03:12:36.306 --> 03:12:36.947]  Why?
[03:12:36.947 --> 03:12:37.387]  Yep.
[03:12:37.387 --> 03:12:38.488]  Very simply.
[03:12:38.488 --> 03:12:40.730]  Their family members now know they're here.
[03:12:40.730 --> 03:12:43.572]  The people who they borrowed money from know they're here.
[03:12:43.572 --> 03:12:43.892]  Uh-huh.
[03:12:43.892 --> 03:12:46.034]  And now they'll extort them for the money.
[03:12:46.034 --> 03:12:47.876]  So if you want to put them in danger... I do.
[03:12:47.876 --> 03:12:50.538]  ...you're taking pictures.
[03:12:50.538 --> 03:12:52.119]  We had to disguise... Good pause.
[03:12:52.119 --> 03:12:53.720]  We had to disguise a woman's voice.
[03:12:53.720 --> 03:12:55.442]  It's so recognizable.
[03:12:55.442 --> 03:13:03.829]  So there are famous reporters for famous networks that on their vacation are fighting because their network won't let you see this.
[03:13:03.829 --> 03:13:04.930]  You can't make this up.
[03:13:07.142 --> 03:13:11.387]  This is shot on a female reporter's phone.
[03:13:11.387 --> 03:13:14.050]  By herself at the border.
[03:13:14.050 --> 03:13:14.430]  Continue.
[03:13:18.832 --> 03:13:21.533]  This is a Catholic Charities Centre.
[03:13:21.533 --> 03:13:24.634]  It's a respite centre for the illegals in the English border.
[03:13:24.634 --> 03:13:32.016]  These are 1, 2, 3, 4 border patrol vehicles here to drop off people and things.
[03:13:32.016 --> 03:13:36.898]  The lady is clearly upset that I'm taking this video of people driving.
[03:13:50.086 --> 03:14:00.493]  What if I told you thousands of times, because I see it in the news and always it's buried, they had the mayor's family and all these people, they'll catch like 10 illegals in dungeons under their house.
[03:14:00.493 --> 03:14:01.934]  Only folks have basements around here.
[03:14:02.972 --> 03:14:04.753]  Our dungeon keeper liberals.
[03:14:04.753 --> 03:14:08.354]  And then they'll have baseball bats, they're sucking money out of them.
[03:14:08.354 --> 03:14:14.277]  And so, the Border Patrol delivers, in many cases, to the coyotes to suck the money out of them.
[03:14:14.277 --> 03:14:17.018]  And the women are sent to prostitution, all of it.
[03:14:17.018 --> 03:14:26.962]  And there are a lot of great Catholics I know and everything, but the Catholic Church itself is liberal in Texas and Mexico, and is aiding and abetting the collapse of this country.
[03:14:26.962 --> 03:14:29.963]  A member of Soros partners with MasterCard to hand out money to migrants.
[03:14:31.036 --> 03:14:33.539]  He posed for photos in Reuters and bragged about it.
[03:14:33.539 --> 03:14:35.321]  Lou Dobbs covered it.
[03:14:35.321 --> 03:14:36.902]  They said, we apologize at Fox.
[03:14:36.902 --> 03:14:37.603]  It's not true.
[03:14:37.603 --> 03:14:39.005]  Soros isn't involved.
[03:14:39.005 --> 03:14:41.828]  He's just in hundreds of articles bragging about it.
[03:14:41.828 --> 03:14:42.629]  We apologize.
[03:14:42.629 --> 03:14:43.950]  Birds don't fly.
[03:14:43.950 --> 03:14:45.752]  The sky's not blue.
[03:14:45.752 --> 03:14:47.634]  Turkeys aren't eaten on Easter.
[03:14:47.634 --> 03:14:48.355]  And so aren't you.
[03:14:50.140 --> 03:14:54.223]  I take it down, says Vito O'Rourke, of current border barriers.
[03:14:54.223 --> 03:14:57.445]  There is no crisis and no problem.
[03:14:57.445 --> 03:14:59.566]  Just 200,000 dead in Mexico.
[03:14:59.566 --> 03:15:03.328]  Just travel advisories to most Mexican states.
[03:15:03.328 --> 03:15:09.072]  By the way, I thought it was hype that Cancun, where I've been going since I was a kid, is too dangerous to be in.
[03:15:09.072 --> 03:15:14.555]  So we flew down there and I said, OK, we'll get it where they say there's not any crime, Isla Mujeres, off the coast.
[03:15:14.555 --> 03:15:16.717]  We still fly into Cancun to be in that
[03:15:18.197 --> 03:15:23.965]  Quintana Roo or whatever you call that state in Yucatan Peninsula.
[03:15:23.965 --> 03:15:31.475]  Armored vehicles, troops everywhere, people running around scared and I learned while we were in Isla Mujeres for a week or five days.
[03:15:32.592 --> 03:15:38.855]  Every night people were killed, people in their hotel rooms, marine gun battles, people robbed at the steakhouses.
[03:15:38.855 --> 03:15:43.217]  I guess we had a Mexican federali with us who was off duty that I had for security.
[03:15:43.217 --> 03:15:48.479]  He showed me all the police reports, all the intel, the surveillance footage, the death every night.
[03:15:48.479 --> 03:15:50.580]  Just total frickin' war, man.
[03:15:50.580 --> 03:15:51.600]  Way worse than you here.
[03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:52.461]  Don't go to Cancun.
[03:15:52.978 --> 03:15:56.560]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[03:17:53.922 --> 03:18:03.229]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:18:03.229 --> 03:18:06.092]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:18:06.092 --> 03:18:12.137]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:18:12.797 --> 03:18:19.063]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globals tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:18:19.063 --> 03:18:25.349]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:18:25.349 --> 03:18:32.296]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:18:33.437 --> 03:18:46.466]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[03:18:46.466 --> 03:18:50.709]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[03:18:50.709 --> 03:18:53.951]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:18:53.951 --> 03:18:56.013]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[03:18:56.013 --> 03:18:56.333]  Go ahead.
[03:18:57.372 --> 03:18:58.853]  I just have to say something, man.
[03:18:58.853 --> 03:19:02.694]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[03:19:02.694 --> 03:19:04.135]  It just gets old, man.
[03:19:04.135 --> 03:19:06.556]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[03:19:06.556 --> 03:19:08.876]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[03:19:08.876 --> 03:19:12.878]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[03:19:12.878 --> 03:19:15.319]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[03:19:16.179 --> 03:19:18.860]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[03:19:18.860 --> 03:19:20.221]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[03:19:20.221 --> 03:19:21.341]  Us being shut down?
[03:19:21.341 --> 03:19:22.822]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[03:19:22.822 --> 03:19:23.902]  You know what, Alex?
[03:19:23.902 --> 03:19:25.003]  Hey, put him on pause again.
[03:19:25.003 --> 03:19:26.103]  Hey, Frank!
[03:19:26.103 --> 03:19:31.745]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[03:19:31.745 --> 03:19:36.287]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[03:19:36.287 --> 03:19:39.148]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[03:19:39.148 --> 03:19:39.889]  Do you understand?
[03:19:39.889 --> 03:19:41.509]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:19:41.509 --> 03:19:42.630]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:19:43.630 --> 03:19:48.997]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars.
[03:19:48.997 --> 03:19:49.978]  Do you understand?
[03:19:49.978 --> 03:19:51.600]  I need your help, Frank!
[03:19:51.600 --> 03:19:57.508]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[03:19:57.508 --> 03:20:00.151]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.459 --> 03:20:23.142]  The power of word of mouth, the power to override the silicon iron curtain is beyond paramount.
[03:20:23.142 --> 03:20:24.782]  It is essential.
[03:20:46.141 --> 03:21:02.885]  And you, the viewer and the listener, out of the whole spectrum of billions of voices and millions of programs around the world, are able to decide that the information we cover here is important.
[03:21:02.885 --> 03:21:05.966]  The globalists have already decided that we are a kryptonite to their evil.
[03:21:07.338 --> 03:21:21.703]  They've already hit the panic button and said, at any cost, shut him up, shut InfoWars down because of the guests and the listeners and the Paul Revere service that all of us together provide.
[03:21:21.703 --> 03:21:27.906]  We're the simple, free market, common sense folks that built civilization in this world.
[03:21:27.906 --> 03:21:30.587]  And we are rebooting what we know works.
[03:21:30.587 --> 03:21:36.349]  That's why I want to thank you and salute you and encourage you all to keep using your free speech because you are the resistance.
[03:21:37.438 --> 03:21:39.560]  Now, Gerald Solentik takes over.
[03:21:39.560 --> 03:21:41.061]  Thank you, Gerald.
[03:21:41.061 --> 03:21:44.083]  Thank you, Alex, and thank you for all that you do.
[03:21:44.083 --> 03:21:51.529]  And what Alex was saying to support InfoWars and the wonderful products that they have, like those water filters.
[03:21:51.529 --> 03:21:56.312]  And here's a story that just came out this weekend.
[03:21:56.312 --> 03:22:01.376]  Is Poland's spring water really from a spring?
[03:22:01.376 --> 03:22:06.000]  Not one drop, a lawsuit claims.
[03:22:07.386 --> 03:22:15.510]  Not one drop of Poland's spring water actually qualifies as spring water, the lawsuit says.
[03:22:15.510 --> 03:22:32.499]  It is common ground water that has been illegally mislabeled in order to reap massive undue sales.
[03:22:32.499 --> 03:22:35.661]  That's what the lawsuit says.
[03:22:37.654 --> 03:22:43.275]  So again, you know, people are talking about climate change and this and that.
[03:22:43.275 --> 03:22:48.756]  How about stopping the poisons that are killing us right now?
[03:22:48.756 --> 03:23:00.079]  And that's why you want to buy a water filter from InfoWars and other products to keep you healthy at this time of mass poisoning.
[03:23:00.079 --> 03:23:04.820]  What they're throwing into the ground is polluting our food, our water.
[03:23:06.414 --> 03:23:08.814]  And what they're putting into the air.
[03:23:08.814 --> 03:23:31.679]  So these products are very essential, not only to keep you healthy and happy, but also to keep InfoWars to thrive, survive, and help you as well cash in on the benefits of freedom of speech.
[03:23:31.679 --> 03:23:36.180]  I want to talk about some international going-ons at this time.
[03:23:36.980 --> 03:23:41.003]  They had an election over there in Turkey yesterday.
[03:23:41.003 --> 03:23:43.765]  Opposition claims victory in Ankara.
[03:23:43.765 --> 03:23:46.167]  Pulls ahead in Istanbul.
[03:23:46.167 --> 03:23:48.409]  Istanbul means Constantinople.
[03:23:48.409 --> 03:23:51.332]  That was a song when I was a kid.
[03:23:51.332 --> 03:23:56.195]  So, what's going on over there?
[03:23:56.195 --> 03:23:58.557]  An economic slowdown.
[03:23:58.557 --> 03:24:02.661]  The Turkish leader has been getting battered by the US dollar.
[03:24:02.661 --> 03:24:04.942]  I mention this because this is the issue
[03:24:06.266 --> 03:24:21.976]  Of virtually every election around the world, except in the U.S.S.A., where we got all these little candidates that are running in the presidential reality show.
[03:24:21.976 --> 03:24:35.085]  And the fraud of the frauds, as I see it, you know the motto of the Trends Journal, think for yourself, is that Beto O'Rourke, which I had forecast on David's Night Show,
[03:24:36.445 --> 03:24:46.154]  Back in February that he would be running and he'd be the leading contender is two months before he announced.
[03:24:46.154 --> 03:24:49.838]  So where are we going with this?
[03:24:49.838 --> 03:25:00.949]  I was listening to him painfully and what he had to say when he announced his candidacy officially in El Paso.
[03:25:04.841 --> 03:25:12.026]  The challenges before us are the greatest of our lifetime.
[03:25:12.026 --> 03:25:14.687]  What, are you kidding me?
[03:25:14.687 --> 03:25:18.350]  What challenges are you talking about, Junior?
[03:25:18.350 --> 03:25:21.091]  Or I should say, White Obama.
[03:25:21.091 --> 03:25:24.494]  And don't call me racist for calling a white cat, cat.
[03:25:24.494 --> 03:25:26.095]  But he ain't a cat.
[03:25:26.095 --> 03:25:31.638]  I would say he's a pussy cat.
[03:25:31.638 --> 03:25:32.599]  He's a nothing.
[03:25:33.379 --> 03:25:35.820]  Oh, well, your head's going all over.
[03:25:35.820 --> 03:25:45.605]  Nothing more than a lot of empty garbage spewing out of the privileged boy's mouth who plays like he's the common man.
[03:25:45.605 --> 03:25:47.585]  Oh, granddaddy's a billionaire.
[03:25:47.585 --> 03:25:51.027]  Yeah, my daddy, he married a rich woman, too.
[03:25:51.027 --> 03:25:53.548]  Runs in the family, doesn't it?
[03:25:53.548 --> 03:25:57.070]  Went to a privileged private school.
[03:25:57.070 --> 03:25:58.751]  Yep.
[03:25:58.751 --> 03:25:59.791]  And nothing.
[03:25:59.791 --> 03:26:00.852]  And nobody.
[03:26:00.852 --> 03:26:01.572]  And here's what else.
[03:26:03.240 --> 03:26:19.625]  The white Obama blew out when he announced his candidacy in the Presidential Reality Show on Sunday.
[03:26:19.625 --> 03:26:22.686]  This is our moment of truth.
[03:26:22.686 --> 03:26:27.747]  Aren't you a moment of truth?
[03:26:27.747 --> 03:26:29.408]  What truth are you talking about?
[03:26:30.177 --> 03:26:32.298]  Hey, give me some examples.
[03:26:32.298 --> 03:26:33.018]  Junior.
[03:26:33.018 --> 03:26:38.960]  See, I can call him Junior when I call Obama Junior, then I'm racist.
[03:26:38.960 --> 03:26:41.941]  But I'm not racist anymore, Junior.
[03:26:41.941 --> 03:26:49.564]  I call all little boys Junior, regardless of race, creed, and color.
[03:26:49.564 --> 03:26:52.845]  Or little boys.
[03:26:53.601 --> 03:27:10.550]  Regardless of race, creed, and color, I'm tired of these little cowards with cojones much smaller than mothballs, playing tough guy when they couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, but send other people to go do their murderous killing.
[03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:21.676]  Oh yeah, you got a track record there, Beto, or is it B.O., of all those military budgets that you voted for.
[03:27:23.414 --> 03:27:24.515]  Nothing.
[03:27:24.515 --> 03:27:29.057]  Anyway, going back to elections, another one in Algeria.
[03:27:29.057 --> 03:27:33.859]  They're trying to get rid of this president that's been around since 1999.
[03:27:33.859 --> 03:27:39.362]  The cat got a stroke a number of years ago.
[03:27:39.362 --> 03:27:44.464]  He has not publicly spoken to the people in six years.
[03:27:44.464 --> 03:27:47.846]  And so the flunky crew behind him is running the show.
[03:27:47.846 --> 03:27:49.206]  Guess what?
[03:27:49.206 --> 03:27:50.687]  The people are taken to the streets.
[03:27:52.602 --> 03:27:56.623]  By the hundreds of thousands, millions!
[03:27:56.623 --> 03:27:59.825]  And they're making change happen.
[03:27:59.825 --> 03:28:01.685]  Turkey.
[03:28:01.685 --> 03:28:03.366]  Algeria.
[03:28:03.366 --> 03:28:05.967]  One nation after another.
[03:28:05.967 --> 03:28:08.868]  But not in the U.S.S.A.
[03:28:08.868 --> 03:28:09.848]  Nope.
[03:28:09.848 --> 03:28:12.869]  The country of cowards.
[03:28:12.869 --> 03:28:15.290]  Democrats and Republicans.
[03:28:15.290 --> 03:28:20.072]  Who in their right mind would support a Mitch McConnell?
[03:28:20.072 --> 03:28:21.072]  Or a Pelosi?
[03:28:22.421 --> 03:28:26.302]  A Feinstein or a Graham.
[03:28:26.302 --> 03:28:29.223]  A little Chuckie Schumer.
[03:28:29.223 --> 03:28:30.984]  No fight in America.
[03:28:30.984 --> 03:28:33.525]  That's why you have to support InfoWars.
[03:28:33.525 --> 03:28:35.885]  Keep the truth going.
[03:28:35.885 --> 03:28:39.686]  Because if you don't, you're going to take it away from us.
[03:28:39.686 --> 03:28:41.807]  We're going to be back in a little bit.
[03:28:41.807 --> 03:28:44.288]  Don't forget, buy those InfoWars products.
[03:28:53.046 --> 03:28:56.628]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.628 --> 03:29:00.190]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.190 --> 03:29:04.352]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill, so what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?
[03:29:04.352 --> 03:29:10.115]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads, made by Biomed DB Design, right here in the USA, come in all sizes.
[03:29:10.115 --> 03:29:16.759]  Our extra-large, microwavable heating pad for back pain is designed to be large enough to cover your entire back.
[03:29:16.759 --> 03:29:20.321]  It's also perfect to wrap around your legs, knees, or shoulder and neck.

[03:31:02.206 --> 03:31:03.427]  Believe me, I know.
[03:31:03.427 --> 03:31:08.374]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:31:08.374 --> 03:31:11.438]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com,
[03:31:11.918 --> 03:31:13.600]  I still have that energy.
[03:31:13.600 --> 03:31:33.762]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:33:13.840 --> 03:33:16.221]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:16.221 --> 03:33:18.921]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:33:18.921 --> 03:33:22.202]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:22.202 --> 03:33:26.803]  Hey, great being back with Alex Jones.
[03:33:26.803 --> 03:33:33.064]  And I love that little take on super male vitality.
[03:33:33.064 --> 03:33:35.345]  Keeps me alive and going.
[03:33:35.345 --> 03:33:41.526]  Got a boogie before the lights go out because tomorrow is iffy and super male vitality.
[03:33:42.287 --> 03:33:44.028]  Keeps that boogie going.
[03:33:44.028 --> 03:33:46.349]  Yep.
[03:33:46.349 --> 03:33:52.691]  So, talking about B.O., NATO, Iraq.
[03:33:52.691 --> 03:33:55.432]  Here's the, uh, from the toilet paper record.
[03:33:55.432 --> 03:34:00.675]  I meant said Sunday, I meant Saturday, that he announced, I believe.
[03:34:00.675 --> 03:34:04.756]  Immigration at core as Iraq starts campaign.
[03:34:04.756 --> 03:34:11.239]  I heard Alex Jones, before I got on, say, all these people coming over the border, you want them to come over?
[03:34:12.168 --> 03:34:13.188]  Put them in your house.
[03:34:13.188 --> 03:34:13.828]  Feed them.
[03:34:13.828 --> 03:34:15.329]  That's what we say.
[03:34:15.329 --> 03:34:18.509]  We did a press release a number of months ago.
[03:34:18.509 --> 03:34:22.050]  Wall or no wall, let the people vote.
[03:34:22.050 --> 03:34:25.691]  Make it a national referendum.
[03:34:25.691 --> 03:34:28.751]  Yes, I want a wall.
[03:34:28.751 --> 03:34:32.912]  It will cost X billions of dollars.
[03:34:32.912 --> 03:34:35.853]  No, I don't want a wall.
[03:34:35.853 --> 03:34:38.153]  I am willing to pay more in taxes.
[03:34:39.923 --> 03:34:44.767]  To take care of the immigrants coming into the country.
[03:34:44.767 --> 03:34:48.910]  And put out how much it would cost for each one coming in.
[03:34:48.910 --> 03:34:50.171]  So let the people vote on it.
[03:34:50.171 --> 03:34:51.592]  You want to pay more money?
[03:34:51.592 --> 03:34:53.674]  And here's what I say.
[03:34:53.674 --> 03:34:55.095]  You want to bring them in?
[03:34:55.095 --> 03:34:56.376]  Bring them in!
[03:34:56.376 --> 03:34:57.957]  House them.
[03:34:57.957 --> 03:34:59.498]  Feed them.
[03:34:59.498 --> 03:35:01.119]  Clothe them.
[03:35:01.119 --> 03:35:02.420]  Take care of their health care.
[03:35:02.420 --> 03:35:05.963]  Oh, and education.
[03:35:05.963 --> 03:35:09.025]  Oh, that's what BO wants to do, too.
[03:35:09.025 --> 03:35:09.646]  Besides, uh,
[03:35:10.461 --> 03:35:12.602]  Better health care, which I'm all in favor of.
[03:35:12.602 --> 03:35:21.428]  He also called for better pay for teachers.
[03:35:21.428 --> 03:35:23.770]  Let's pay them what they're worth.
[03:35:23.770 --> 03:35:26.472]  Well, I'll tell you what I think they're worth.
[03:35:26.472 --> 03:35:28.453]  I think they're worth nothing.
[03:35:28.453 --> 03:35:31.495]  I can't stand the public education system.
[03:35:31.495 --> 03:35:35.178]  It's an industrial age model.
[03:35:35.178 --> 03:35:36.759]  Beto.
[03:35:36.759 --> 03:35:37.539]  That's right.
[03:35:37.539 --> 03:35:38.500]  Created by the Germans.
[03:35:39.659 --> 03:35:47.665]  The beginning of the Industrial Age took people off all their farms and hometowns and put them in centralized locations.
[03:35:47.665 --> 03:35:54.451]  Industrialization taught them how to read, write, do a little bit of arithmetic, and follow orders!
[03:35:55.785 --> 03:35:57.566]  To follow orders.
[03:35:57.566 --> 03:36:00.989]  That's all this stinking education system does.
[03:36:00.989 --> 03:36:02.350]  Follow orders.
[03:36:02.350 --> 03:36:04.191]  A general education, sir.
[03:36:04.191 --> 03:36:05.532]  General education.
[03:36:05.532 --> 03:36:07.113]  You gotta learn chemistry, biology.
[03:36:07.113 --> 03:36:10.676]  You have to learn a lot of crap that you'll never use and you have no mind for.
[03:36:10.676 --> 03:36:12.437]  Because we say so.
[03:36:12.437 --> 03:36:24.667]  We're a bunch of arrogant people that you pay a lot of money, particularly these superintendents like the clown we got over here in Kingston that makes all this money and is nothing more than a waste of money.
[03:36:25.427 --> 03:36:30.408]  And one in your country, or county, city, and state!
[03:36:30.408 --> 03:36:31.569]  More pay?
[03:36:31.569 --> 03:36:35.229]  Do away with the public education system!
[03:36:35.229 --> 03:36:37.230]  You wanna have kids?
[03:36:37.230 --> 03:36:38.250]  You educate them!
[03:36:38.250 --> 03:36:39.771]  You got the internet now!
[03:36:39.771 --> 03:36:42.311]  You have the Alexandrian Library!
[03:36:42.311 --> 03:36:44.892]  People are bored, they're bored, man!
[03:36:44.892 --> 03:36:45.232]  And woof!
[03:36:46.041 --> 03:36:48.663]  They're on their computers already.
[03:36:48.663 --> 03:36:51.525]  That's their life in the new generation.
[03:36:51.525 --> 03:36:55.208]  Generation Z equals Generation Zero.
[03:36:55.208 --> 03:36:58.150]  Wrote about it in one of our top trends in 2019.
[03:36:58.150 --> 03:37:00.232]  They're addicted to these things.
[03:37:00.232 --> 03:37:03.134]  They don't like being social.
[03:37:03.134 --> 03:37:05.115]  So they don't have to send them to school.
[03:37:05.115 --> 03:37:07.177]  And what do these schools look like?
[03:37:07.177 --> 03:37:08.337]  Prisons!
[03:37:08.337 --> 03:37:11.520]  They're so damn ugly!
[03:37:11.520 --> 03:37:14.262]  Anyway, public education
[03:37:15.169 --> 03:37:17.310]  Only for the poorest.
[03:37:17.310 --> 03:37:19.512]  That's my vote.
[03:37:19.512 --> 03:37:20.892]  You wanna have children?
[03:37:20.892 --> 03:37:23.574]  Have as many as you want.
[03:37:23.574 --> 03:37:25.135]  You pay for them.
[03:37:25.135 --> 03:37:26.956]  I'll pay some.
[03:37:26.956 --> 03:37:31.018]  Here I am at my age, I still gotta pay school taxes?
[03:37:31.018 --> 03:37:36.522]  Oh, and by the way, I never had any children.
[03:37:36.522 --> 03:37:38.423]  So.
[03:37:38.423 --> 03:37:40.044]  That's Beto.
[03:37:40.044 --> 03:37:43.946]  More BS from B.O.
[03:37:44.841 --> 03:37:47.863]  And boys, the media pumping them.
[03:37:47.863 --> 03:37:50.986]  Now I want to talk about some other issues.
[03:37:50.986 --> 03:37:56.630]  I was talking about elections overseas.
[03:37:56.630 --> 03:37:58.652]  Over there.
[03:37:58.652 --> 03:37:59.152]  Over there.
[03:37:59.152 --> 03:38:00.013]  Remember over there?
[03:38:00.013 --> 03:38:13.604]  Remember over there how the United States under the Nobel piece of crap prize winner Obama overthrew the democratically elected government of Ukraine?
[03:38:13.604 --> 03:38:13.984]  Yeah.
[03:38:15.419 --> 03:38:17.741]  Ah, that's only history.
[03:38:17.741 --> 03:38:19.803]  You remember Victoria Nuland?
[03:38:19.803 --> 03:38:20.443]  Yep.
[03:38:20.443 --> 03:38:26.689]  Her husband, the head of that right-wing group?
[03:38:26.689 --> 03:38:31.493]  Passing out cookies over there to the protesters?
[03:38:31.493 --> 03:38:34.936]  The neo-Nazis who overthrew the government?
[03:38:34.936 --> 03:38:38.059]  They were gonna bring democracy over there!
[03:38:38.059 --> 03:38:39.740]  Hey, you heard that line before?
[03:38:39.740 --> 03:38:41.522]  Oh yeah, you're hearing it now!
[03:38:41.522 --> 03:38:41.762]  Again.
[03:38:42.549 --> 03:38:46.711]  Look at what Trump is doing with Venezuela and Pompeo and Bolton.
[03:38:46.711 --> 03:38:48.572]  Talking about bringing democracy.
[03:38:48.572 --> 03:38:50.632]  How about the oil?
[03:38:50.632 --> 03:38:52.833]  Anyway, going back to Ukraine.
[03:38:52.833 --> 03:38:57.936]  You're putting that guy Poroshenko, right?
[03:38:57.936 --> 03:39:00.497]  They had an election yesterday.
[03:39:00.497 --> 03:39:01.657]  This is before the election.
[03:39:01.657 --> 03:39:06.519]  9% of Ukrainians have confidence in their government. 9%!
[03:39:12.261 --> 03:39:12.862]  9%!
[03:39:12.862 --> 03:39:15.404]  All right?
[03:39:15.404 --> 03:39:20.207]  I'm not good at math, but I can count to 10.
[03:39:20.207 --> 03:39:20.888]  9%!
[03:39:20.888 --> 03:39:26.872]  That many!
[03:39:26.872 --> 03:39:29.394]  And a government that the United States put in there.
[03:39:29.394 --> 03:39:31.916]  So they had an election yesterday.
[03:39:31.916 --> 03:39:33.457]  Oh, they did?
[03:39:33.457 --> 03:39:35.298]  And who won the election?
[03:39:35.298 --> 03:39:37.900]  Well, you know who won the election, don't you?
[03:39:37.900 --> 03:39:40.062]  A comic.
[03:39:42.113 --> 03:39:43.234]  That's right.
[03:39:43.234 --> 03:39:46.436]  A clown won the election.
[03:39:46.436 --> 03:39:48.957]  They got a runoff coming on.
[03:39:48.957 --> 03:39:54.201]  But a clown ran and won the election.
[03:39:54.201 --> 03:39:57.723]  It's no different than in the United States.
[03:39:57.723 --> 03:40:00.385]  Because what do we have over here?
[03:40:00.385 --> 03:40:08.810]  Do I care what Morlon Mayor Bill Mayer has to say?
[03:40:08.810 --> 03:40:10.491]  Or the other clowns, Kimmel,
[03:40:12.079 --> 03:40:15.301]  And they're reported every day what comics have to say?
[03:40:15.301 --> 03:40:20.063]  And that's all Saturday Night Live has become.
[03:40:20.063 --> 03:40:28.507]  Comics have become political, as my good friend Robert Ferrucci often reminds me.
[03:40:28.507 --> 03:40:32.109]  Not funny politics.
[03:40:32.109 --> 03:40:35.950]  One-sided politics.
[03:40:35.950 --> 03:40:38.972]  That's what the nation's sunk down to.
[03:40:38.972 --> 03:40:41.273]  And that's what's happened, clearly,
[03:40:42.210 --> 03:40:55.883]  As well in Ukraine, a comic, a comic is in the lead and name the country and you got the comic leading them.
[03:40:55.883 --> 03:40:56.063]  Hey.
[03:40:56.755 --> 03:40:58.916]  How about May over there, huh?
[03:40:58.916 --> 03:41:00.036]  Maybe?
[03:41:00.036 --> 03:41:01.657]  Over there in the UK?
[03:41:01.657 --> 03:41:07.259]  Hey, to the people who voted for Brexit, we don't care what your vote is!
[03:41:07.259 --> 03:41:09.280]  You don't matter to us!
[03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:15.143]  So what, you had a referendum, and a majority said you wanted to leave the European Union.
[03:41:15.143 --> 03:41:25.007]  The majority vote doesn't count, we'll tell you what to do, just like they did over there in Greece, when the people voted against the austerity measures.
[03:41:25.675 --> 03:41:26.575]  Screw you!
[03:41:26.575 --> 03:41:30.017]  We're not going to... We'll tell you what you want.
[03:41:30.017 --> 03:41:31.457]  We'll tell you.
[03:41:31.457 --> 03:41:33.958]  We're the politicians.
[03:41:33.958 --> 03:41:35.599]  Name the country.
[03:41:35.599 --> 03:41:38.460]  Macron, the little cotton.
[03:41:38.460 --> 03:41:42.562]  A little boy had nothing over there in France.
[03:41:42.562 --> 03:41:47.524]  And here we are in the United States going into the presidential reality show.
[03:41:47.524 --> 03:41:48.885]  And it's a cast, boy.
[03:41:48.885 --> 03:41:52.326]  Well, girl, I got to be proper now.
[03:41:52.326 --> 03:41:54.547]  He said, boy, and he didn't say girl.
[03:41:56.345 --> 03:42:03.210]  But talking about that, how about the big news about Joe Biden, huh?
[03:42:03.210 --> 03:42:09.015]  Now, if I were to rate politicians on 1 to 10, where I put Biden, I'd put about a minus 15.
[03:42:09.015 --> 03:42:10.816]  I can't stand the guy.
[03:42:10.816 --> 03:42:14.579]  A phony piece of arrogant garbage.
[03:42:14.579 --> 03:42:16.481]  But what happened?
[03:42:16.481 --> 03:42:18.522]  Made an accusation about him.
[03:42:18.522 --> 03:42:21.284]  That's right.
[03:42:21.284 --> 03:42:23.986]  You could say anything.
[03:42:23.986 --> 03:42:24.567]  Prove nothing.
[03:42:25.822 --> 03:42:27.583]  And you're guilty.
[03:42:27.583 --> 03:42:32.345]  That's where America's become, and that's how dumbed down the media's become.
[03:42:32.345 --> 03:42:34.266]  This isn't journalism.
[03:42:34.266 --> 03:42:37.787]  You made an allegation, show me some proof.
[03:42:37.787 --> 03:42:39.688]  No, don't have to.
[03:42:39.688 --> 03:42:44.110]  Because we're the prostitutes, and we get paid to put out.
[03:42:44.110 --> 03:42:48.492]  But now that info wars, we're gonna be back in a few minutes.

[03:46:56.968 --> 03:46:59.611]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:17.313 --> 03:47:19.234]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:19.234 --> 03:47:28.117]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilenti.
[03:47:28.117 --> 03:47:31.158]  Hey, welcome back, welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:31.158 --> 03:47:34.940]  This is Gerald Cilenti hosting this hour.
[03:47:34.940 --> 03:47:36.260]  It's always great being here.
[03:47:36.260 --> 03:47:40.842]  Remember, put your money where your mind is and your heart.
[03:47:40.842 --> 03:47:46.284]  Support InfoWars to keep freedom of speech alive because they're really taking it away from us.
[03:47:47.125 --> 03:47:53.130]  There was this article I was looking at, you know, the Chinese or how they're putting more and more censorship on.
[03:47:53.130 --> 03:47:58.294]  I'm saying, man, America's catching right up there with them.
[03:47:58.294 --> 03:48:01.136]  So support InfoWars anyway, where you can.
[03:48:01.136 --> 03:48:07.641]  Again, I read you that article about how there's a lawsuit against Poland Spring.
[03:48:07.641 --> 03:48:09.182]  It's not spring water at all.
[03:48:09.182 --> 03:48:10.043]  I'm not saying it.
[03:48:10.043 --> 03:48:11.144]  That's what the lawsuit is.
[03:48:11.144 --> 03:48:13.966]  So don't come after me, Mr. Nestle.
[03:48:13.966 --> 03:48:16.328]  I think they're the ones that own Poland Spring.
[03:48:17.418 --> 03:48:20.360]  And I was mentioning also about Joe Biden.
[03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:22.401]  Again, a disgusting human being.
[03:48:22.401 --> 03:48:23.562]  Can't stand the guy.
[03:48:23.562 --> 03:48:28.266]  He's a phony fraud, arrogant, never worked a day in his life.
[03:48:28.266 --> 03:48:31.808]  He's been playing his, he's been a lifelong politician.
[03:48:31.808 --> 03:48:32.829]  Another one of those.
[03:48:32.829 --> 03:48:35.210]  Oh, I'm sorry I did that.
[03:48:35.210 --> 03:48:37.032]  I'm sorry I did that.
[03:48:37.032 --> 03:48:40.894]  I regret I did that because now I'm running, I may run for office.
[03:48:40.894 --> 03:48:45.938]  So I'm going to backtrack on all the miserable things I did to make people's lives so disgusting.
[03:48:46.852 --> 03:49:04.586]  But anyway, when he was accused of blowing on the hair, or breathing on the hair of a woman, and then kissing her in the back of the head, it happened, what, in 2015?
[03:49:04.586 --> 03:49:06.107]  Four years ago.
[03:49:06.107 --> 03:49:08.009]  Oh, I was terrified, I couldn't say anything.
[03:49:08.009 --> 03:49:13.753]  If that was my mother, may her soul rest in peace, or any of my aunts, they were like, you son of a, what the hell are you doing?
[03:49:13.753 --> 03:49:14.814]  Get the hell out of here!
[03:49:16.021 --> 03:49:18.722]  They're gonna care less who it was.
[03:49:18.722 --> 03:49:20.062]  Oh, no.
[03:49:20.062 --> 03:49:22.163]  I couldn't say anything.
[03:49:22.163 --> 03:49:23.464]  Oh, you know, that's right.
[03:49:23.464 --> 03:49:25.284]  She was running for office.
[03:49:25.284 --> 03:49:28.265]  She was the perfect politician, man.
[03:49:28.265 --> 03:49:29.506]  Women.
[03:49:29.506 --> 03:49:41.210]  Anyway, again, one of our top trends in the Trends Journal this year, 2019, was America Puritan 2.0.
[03:49:41.210 --> 03:49:43.871]  This is more of the proof.
[03:49:43.871 --> 03:49:44.731]  Say anything.
[03:49:45.925 --> 03:49:48.067]  Prove nothing!
[03:49:48.067 --> 03:49:51.689]  And you are guilty!
[03:49:51.689 --> 03:49:55.592]  Anybody can... That's not journalism!
[03:49:55.592 --> 03:49:58.794]  And that's why subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[03:49:58.794 --> 03:50:01.536]  Because that's journalism.
[03:50:01.536 --> 03:50:04.558]  If you want the current events forming future trends.
[03:50:04.558 --> 03:50:07.800]  Support InfoWars.
[03:50:07.800 --> 03:50:14.365]  Support the media where people take a stand and aren't told what to do.
[03:50:15.609 --> 03:50:18.011]  Like the prostitutes do.
[03:50:18.011 --> 03:50:23.416]  That's such a disgusting story, and there's so many more important things going on.
[03:50:23.416 --> 03:50:29.060]  And one of them, put your money where your mind is, on those markets, huh?
[03:50:29.060 --> 03:50:31.202]  They're up 300 points.
[03:50:31.202 --> 03:50:34.305]  That's right.
[03:50:34.305 --> 03:50:40.510]  This is some quarter that this is starting out to.
[03:50:40.510 --> 03:50:43.893]  US manufacturing activity expanded last month.
[03:50:45.003 --> 03:50:51.947]  Rebounding from its lowest level since late 2016.
[03:50:51.947 --> 03:50:57.610]  Over there in China, they had a good time too.
[03:50:57.610 --> 03:51:06.855]  Their Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index jumped 50.8 in March.
[03:51:06.855 --> 03:51:09.777]  Over 50 means growth.
[03:51:09.777 --> 03:51:11.398]  And that's the highest level in 8 months.
[03:51:14.172 --> 03:51:16.273]  And it was down, they expected it to be at 49.9.
[03:51:16.273 --> 03:51:26.799]  So, China is also pushing stimulus in there.
[03:51:26.799 --> 03:51:35.464]  Last Wednesday, we sent our subscribers a trend alert.
[03:51:35.464 --> 03:51:38.806]  That's right.
[03:51:38.806 --> 03:51:41.367]  Fed can't wait, needs to move.
[03:51:42.651 --> 03:51:47.353]  Beyond the accelerating global economic slowdown, we forecast a weakening U.S.
[03:51:47.353 --> 03:51:54.757]  gross domestic product, which we still do, and lower corporate earnings, which we still do, that will require the U.S.
[03:51:54.757 --> 03:52:06.203]  Federal Reserve to lower interest rates now before economic conditions markedly deteriorate.
[03:52:06.203 --> 03:52:10.345]  And then what happened?
[03:52:10.345 --> 03:52:11.806]  We sent that out on Wednesday.
[03:52:13.069 --> 03:52:27.900]  Larry Kudlow, President Trump's Chief Economic Advisor, recommended lowering interest rates now.
[03:52:27.900 --> 03:52:29.341]  That's right.
[03:52:29.341 --> 03:52:35.625]  I guess he reads our Trends Alerts and subscribes to the Trends Journal, because we said it first.
[03:52:35.625 --> 03:52:38.688]  It's right there in print.
[03:52:38.688 --> 03:52:40.449]  They have to lower rates now.
[03:52:42.281 --> 03:52:52.765]  The rest of the world doesn't have that capacity, because much of the world, like Europe, is in negative interest rate territory, as is Japan.
[03:52:52.765 --> 03:52:55.225]  And Europe is slowing down.
[03:52:55.225 --> 03:53:00.367]  And over there in China, they only could do so much stimulus.
[03:53:00.367 --> 03:53:05.509]  They got a $40 trillion debt bubble.
[03:53:05.509 --> 03:53:07.350]  And now things are slowing down there.
[03:53:07.350 --> 03:53:11.171]  Yeah, this number came out, it's a bit positive, but there are a lot of negatives.
[03:53:12.782 --> 03:53:18.184]  So in order for this economy to move forward, you have to see interest rates go down.
[03:53:18.184 --> 03:53:21.525]  Am I saying they should go down?
[03:53:21.525 --> 03:53:22.465]  No.
[03:53:22.465 --> 03:53:24.826]  We're trend forecasters.
[03:53:24.826 --> 03:53:33.288]  When we make a statement as to, for example, we don't take a side on the border wall, we put out the issues.
[03:53:33.288 --> 03:53:37.630]  Am I personally in favor of not bringing more illegal immigrants in?
[03:53:37.630 --> 03:53:39.390]  Yes.
[03:53:39.390 --> 03:53:41.151]  But we leave it to the people.
[03:53:41.755 --> 03:53:43.756]  Have a referendum.
[03:53:43.756 --> 03:53:45.917]  On the economy?
[03:53:45.917 --> 03:53:47.238]  Same thing.
[03:53:47.238 --> 03:53:52.361]  I called for an economic 9-11 when interest rates were going to go up.
[03:53:52.361 --> 03:53:57.663]  And they signaled they would go up two to three times in 2019, back in September 2018.
[03:53:57.663 --> 03:54:04.587]  You saw the markets fall to their worst December they had since the Great Depression.
[03:54:05.762 --> 03:54:15.146]  And I made the forecast of an economic 9-11 the day before, September 19th, the day before the S&P 500 peaked.
[03:54:15.146 --> 03:54:17.907]  So we go with the trends.
[03:54:17.907 --> 03:54:21.208]  We're not holding on to an ideology.
[03:54:21.208 --> 03:54:27.231]  So we were the first, when I was on Alex Jones Show, to call the Trump rally in 2016.
[03:54:27.231 --> 03:54:28.811]  We were the first in February 2018
[03:54:35.930 --> 03:54:39.312]  To call for a market correction last year.
[03:54:39.312 --> 03:54:48.136]  And we were the first, this January, to call the Trump up.
[03:54:48.136 --> 03:54:50.617]  No recession.
[03:54:50.617 --> 03:54:59.941]  But they know that things are slowing down, and that's why Larry Kudlow came out and said, we gotta lower rates.
[03:54:59.941 --> 03:55:01.342]  And he's correct.
[03:55:01.342 --> 03:55:03.563]  We have to lower them because we also say,
[03:55:04.335 --> 03:55:18.822]  Should the Federal Reserve rely on its data-based formula and fail to lower rates ahead of negative trend indicators, we forecast a rapid economic and equity market downward spiral.
[03:55:18.822 --> 03:55:23.344]  You go back and you look at the facts.
[03:55:23.344 --> 03:55:26.245]  They've been late on it all the time.
[03:55:26.245 --> 03:55:29.207]  Bernanke never saw the recession coming when he was Fed Chair.
[03:55:29.207 --> 03:55:31.968]  The numbers are there, the words are there, the facts are there.
[03:55:33.854 --> 03:55:43.500]  So gold prices are going down now, and they're stuck in that range, and you heard me say, maybe six years.
[03:55:43.500 --> 03:55:49.003]  They're only going to rise in times when it has to be a safe haven asset.
[03:55:49.003 --> 03:55:51.805]  And right now, we're not in that territory.
[03:55:51.805 --> 03:55:55.026]  So the bottom of gold as we see it is $1,200.
[03:55:55.026 --> 03:55:59.869]  Has to break above $1,385 for it to push forward.
[03:55:59.869 --> 03:56:01.510]  And when it pushes forward, it has to break $1,450.
[03:56:03.226 --> 03:56:05.808]  $1,450 an ounce.
[03:56:05.808 --> 03:56:11.692]  When it breaks that mark, again, I've been saying this for six years, then it's going to go to $2,000.
[03:56:11.692 --> 03:56:13.713]  Hasn't done that.
[03:56:13.713 --> 03:56:18.917]  We've been right on target with our forecasts.
[03:56:18.917 --> 03:56:23.620]  Average Americans can't afford a home in 70% of the country.
[03:56:23.620 --> 03:56:26.862]  It's going to be the issue in this coming election.
[03:56:26.862 --> 03:56:28.003]  Income inequality.
[03:56:28.003 --> 03:56:32.226]  I told you it was going on over there in Algeria.
[03:56:33.746 --> 03:56:37.129]  What's going on in Ukraine?
[03:56:37.129 --> 03:56:40.672]  It's one country after another.
[03:56:40.672 --> 03:56:44.956]  Income inequality.
[03:56:44.956 --> 03:56:50.862]  So, that's going to be the major issue.
[03:56:50.862 --> 03:56:55.066]  And now you're looking at oil prices going up.
[03:56:55.066 --> 03:56:59.490]  If oil prices go up too high, you're already seeing a push down in retail sales.
[03:57:00.851 --> 03:57:13.396]  If oil prices break above $75 a barrel, and now they're around $70, $69 and change for Brent crude, there's going to be pressure on the economy.
[03:57:13.396 --> 03:57:18.758]  So, stay tuned to the current events forming future trends.
[03:57:18.758 --> 03:57:27.121]  Don't get caught up in the junk news that they're pushing out on the mainstream media.
[03:57:27.121 --> 03:57:28.282]  It's very important.
[03:57:30.230 --> 03:57:43.239]  It's a volatile time, so to stay ahead of the trends and on top of the news, stay tuned to InfoWars and also consider subscribing to the Trends Journal.
[03:57:43.239 --> 03:57:51.065]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[03:57:51.065 --> 03:57:53.807]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[03:57:54.343 --> 03:57:57.464]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[03:57:57.464 --> 03:57:59.025]  I didn't invent all this.
[03:57:59.025 --> 03:58:05.587]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[03:58:05.587 --> 03:58:08.388]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[03:58:09.451 --> 03:58:12.792]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[03:58:12.792 --> 03:58:17.414]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[03:58:17.414 --> 03:58:30.958]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.

[03:58:58.942 --> 03:59:08.070]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:59:08.070 --> 03:59:13.434]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
