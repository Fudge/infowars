[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:18.227]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:29.356]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.665]  Russian scum!
[00:00:38.046 --> 00:00:39.107]  It always comes to mind.
[00:00:43.312 --> 00:00:44.634]  Your reputation's amazing.
[00:00:45.094 --> 00:00:46.396]  I will not let you down.
[00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:49.439]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:09.439]  I've got so much incredible news to cover that I've been running around the building the last 10 minutes.
[00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.860]  I'm literally catching my breath right now.
[00:01:13.642 --> 00:01:13.922]  Wow.
[00:01:16.124 --> 00:01:21.047]  Just when you think the Democrats and the globalists can't get any lower or more arrogant, they do.
[00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:26.351]  And I was going over all these clips and all these news articles and what I want to play today.
[00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:28.713]  And I've got to be very judicious to even get to half of it.
[00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.116]  And it made me think about all the clips I didn't play in the last few days.
[00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:36.394]  I've got all this world-exclusive stuff to break down.
[00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:38.516]  I've got all this other huge news that's breaking.
[00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:40.957]  Just every bit of it more insane than the last.
[00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.064]  The head of the World Bank appointed by a Democrat has resigned.
[00:01:50.304 --> 00:01:52.605]  Major world shake-ups on that front.
[00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:53.306]  Big shake-ups.
[00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:55.387]  The Federal Reserve coming, as we told you.
[00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.249]  That's all intertwined.
[00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.052]  The World Bank is the basic foreign arm of the Federal Reserve.
[00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:05.626]  The World Bank's U.S.
[00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.187]  controlled, the IMF's U.S.
[00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:12.311]  and Europe controlled, and the entire globalist order is coming down around us.
[00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:15.174]  China is threatening open war.
[00:02:15.194 --> 00:02:23.340]  The Chinese dictator has come out and threatened to attack Taiwan, threatened to invade Taiwan, threatened to attack U.S.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.620]  ships.
[00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:28.924]  They had more big threats.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.703]  This morning, and ships entered the South China Sea, an area that's not been disputed for hundreds of years.
[00:02:34.783 --> 00:02:35.964]  The Chinese now claim it's theirs.
[00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:37.925]  They threatened to attack the U.S.
[00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:38.445]  destroyer.
[00:02:39.506 --> 00:02:40.947]  This is just some of what's going on.
[00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:43.848]  The big megabanks are trying to plunge the U.S.
[00:02:43.888 --> 00:02:44.349]  economy.
[00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.110]  America is in a trade war against the globalists, fighting for its life.
[00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:52.954]  And the average leftist, with their talking points, has gone into overdrive.
[00:02:53.971 --> 00:03:14.642]  To create racial and cultural division for a planned civil emergency that we have the documents on from Soros that InfoWars broke last January, a year ago, and that got no coverage of their plan to incite race riots as the trigger for martial law.
[00:03:15.922 --> 00:03:17.803]  You'd think that might be big news.
[00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:21.485]  Instead, I just have Soros funding lawsuits against me to shut me up.
[00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:22.746]  I'm never going to shut anything up.
[00:03:24.107 --> 00:03:25.848]  I could die today if this signal goes on.
[00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.510]  People understand globalism.
[00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.770]  They understand the New World Order.
[00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.591]  They understand the attack on free press.
[00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:32.352]  They get it.
[00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.613]  There's no putting the genie back in the bottle.
[00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:41.517]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for the first time in her decades, perched on the court trying to deep sex the country.
[00:03:42.638 --> 00:03:47.520]  She's had lung cancer tumors removed, as you know, a few weeks ago.
[00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:49.862]  Well, she didn't show back up for key votes.
[00:03:52.136 --> 00:03:59.821]  So it looks like she's getting ready to make the jump into hyperspace, and we wish her happy trails beyond the veil.
[00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:02.843]  I hope she lives a long time.
[00:04:02.863 --> 00:04:10.448]  I don't really wish harm on anybody, but I tell you, it's like that leaf on the tree in autumn, that last brown leaf.
[00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.912]  One of the last old Democrats up there running this country down.
[00:04:17.585 --> 00:04:21.167]  You know what old Johnny Cash said in that song?
[00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:24.629]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.991]  Run on for a long time.
[00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.093]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:04:30.493 --> 00:04:33.475]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:04:36.517 --> 00:04:39.879]  When we return, the battle for human
[00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.052]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:17.867]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:27.111]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[00:05:28.097 --> 00:05:35.159]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.279]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.880]  It really is amazing.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.661]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:49.782]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:51.763]  Of InfoWars.
[00:05:52.604 --> 00:05:53.646]  So please spread the links.
[00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:56.912]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:57.213 --> 00:05:59.898]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:01.581]  We're all in each other's hands.
[00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:02.904]  God bless you all and thank you.
[00:06:16.081 --> 00:06:19.105]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:22.049]  Run on for a long time.
[00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.853]  Run on for a long time.
[00:06:25.574 --> 00:06:27.917]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:06:28.558 --> 00:06:31.001]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.031]  It's Monday, January 7th, 2019.
[00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:40.412]  My goodness gracious is the world not in crisis.
[00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:42.953]  But let me make the big announcement.
[00:06:43.374 --> 00:06:44.874]  I've been sitting back
[00:07:02.253 --> 00:07:14.887]  Watching Trump very, very carefully to see if he's A, for real, which I know he is at a gut level, and I've already seen through his action, and B, is he going to go on the offense, which is the only way out of this, or is he going to start going on the defense?
[00:07:15.107 --> 00:07:22.715]  And let me announce to everyone, Donald Trump is big time on the offense, and he's got a
[00:07:24.514 --> 00:07:33.639]  A list of things like any good executive, any good faithful American would do, of what is the top priorities that he's following in that order of prioritization.
[00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:45.285]  And his moves against the CHICOMs that are the number one global threat against this country, allied with the criminals inside our government.
[00:07:45.425 --> 00:07:47.226]  It's the nexus point, the axis of evil.
[00:07:49.407 --> 00:07:53.810]  That combine is being dismantled savagely.
[00:07:55.663 --> 00:08:00.947]  And that's why you see the traitors saying kill him, saying murder his family, saying impeach him.
[00:08:00.967 --> 00:08:03.389]  That's why you see them freaking out.
[00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.073]  Because these flathrags know that their time is very, very short.
[00:08:10.854 --> 00:08:14.317]  But we're now entering the beginning of the maelstrom.
[00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:16.779]  The Black Squall.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.020]  The Tempest.
[00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:20.261]  The Tornado.
[00:08:21.862 --> 00:08:22.683]  The Typhoon.
[00:08:23.483 --> 00:08:24.044]  The Hurricane.
[00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:26.993]  This is it.
[00:08:28.755 --> 00:08:29.235]  This is it.
[00:08:29.515 --> 00:08:39.443]  And I'm just glad America wasn't totally taken over at the end, because we were set up to just be collapsed right into the New World Order, right into the EU and the shy comms, and it's just an incredible time.
[00:08:39.923 --> 00:08:41.985]  Even the New York Times has the headline.
[00:08:44.066 --> 00:08:44.887]  Zero Hedge has it.
[00:08:44.927 --> 00:08:46.168]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:49.751]  President Xi orders Chinese army to prepare for war.
[00:08:52.253 --> 00:08:54.294]  Chinese ships today, when a U.S.
[00:08:54.314 --> 00:09:02.940]  destroyer went through for right of navigation, an area that's always been open, that China has no claim on, but they are claiming they have, threatened to attack our ships.
[00:09:05.662 --> 00:09:09.084]  Told them to turn back or they would be sunk, the destroyer and others.
[00:09:09.124 --> 00:09:10.906]  Well, the destroyers didn't turn back.
[00:09:11.366 --> 00:09:14.728]  And if the Chinese would have fired on those ships, they would have been sunk.
[00:09:15.429 --> 00:09:18.471]  And then we'll see if they want to try to get their ICBMs or cruise missiles.
[00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:36.825]  Off the ground or out of their submarines, but the satellites and the weapon systems, you better believe, and the lurking fixed-wing platforms lurking around China were being watched at every point and being prepared to be targeted.
[00:09:38.103 --> 00:09:47.428]  So when Trump does stuff like this, the full Pentagon has the teeth out, claws out, from space, from the ground, through cyber command, through the whole deal, ready to take the CHICOMS out.
[00:09:47.728 --> 00:09:50.850]  That's how close we are to World War 4.
[00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.952]  The Cold War was called World War 3 by Russian and U.S.
[00:09:54.992 --> 00:09:56.173]  tacticians, accurately.
[00:09:56.593 --> 00:10:01.416]  This is World War 4, and if it goes hot, it's the end of the planet, probably.
[00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:18.725]  Now, the United States has almost launched preemptive attacks on China before, and I'm hoping that's not what's going to happen, but if there's any evidence that they're going to go hot with any of those submarines, or any of those silos, Trump's going to hit China.
[00:10:19.386 --> 00:10:26.129]  And that's why they had Mattis and all these other traitors up there, saying, oh, we made sure to never be out of town, so that he wouldn't nuke people.
[00:10:26.569 --> 00:10:32.672]  Yeah, that's right, because the US has a policy until Trump got in, under Obama, to absorb a first strike.
[00:10:33.993 --> 00:10:35.474]  Under the Presidential Decision Directive?
[00:10:35.894 --> 00:10:36.615]  Well, guess what?
[00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:39.336]  That directive's been rescinded, buckos!
[00:10:41.618 --> 00:10:44.840]  We're not just gonna sit here and bend over to the CHICOMS or anybody else.
[00:10:46.261 --> 00:10:49.142]  They try it, there's gonna be a nuclear war, they're gonna get their ass blown off.
[00:10:50.263 --> 00:10:55.766]  That's why Trump's been trying to be nice with Russia, at least on the surface, so that we don't fight a two-front war that we lose.
[00:10:56.087 --> 00:11:00.830]  But believe me, there'll be a nuclear winner, but we can wipe the CHICOMS out in 20 minutes.
[00:11:02.688 --> 00:11:06.311]  In 20 minutes, there'll be 500 million of them deadered in a hammer.
[00:11:08.312 --> 00:11:10.074]  Every one of their cities will be vaporized.
[00:11:11.695 --> 00:11:13.116]  And that's just the old-fashioned weapons.
[00:11:14.037 --> 00:11:16.438]  But don't think the Chi-Coms don't have some dirty stuff.
[00:11:16.859 --> 00:11:19.441]  They're gonna release bio-weapons the minute they get nuked.
[00:11:20.241 --> 00:11:26.226]  They've got sleeper cells all over Europe and all over the United States with race-specific bio-weapons that kill Anglos.
[00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:29.288]  So don't think it's gonna be that easy.
[00:11:30.725 --> 00:11:32.887]  But don't worry, we've got bioweapons as well.
[00:11:33.667 --> 00:11:36.449]  Everybody's gonna die if the trigger gets pulled.
[00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:44.495]  If I was a selfish person, I'd be in some armored redoubt in Idaho that just looked like a hilltop with my family.
[00:11:45.716 --> 00:11:46.196]  But I'm not.
[00:11:46.336 --> 00:11:47.597]  I'm here and I believe in God.
[00:11:47.617 --> 00:11:51.300]  And I believe and we pray and we take action that this can all be averted.
[00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:58.866]  But America can't just roll over to the dirty proboscis of the New World Order.
[00:11:59.693 --> 00:12:04.497]  And let it run its stinking tentacle into us.
[00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:05.278]  It's not going to happen.
[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.341]  So it's a big world.
[00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:09.262]  Big things happening.
[00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:21.853]  Everything Trump's done to the CHICOMS and their allies has cut their money off, cut their fraud off, cut their intelligence agencies off, arrest the head of their biggest spy network with their 5G control grid coming in.
[00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:26.762]  Last year, Trump takes aim at World Bank over China loans.
[00:12:27.602 --> 00:12:33.204]  U.S.-backed money backing Chinese projects in Africa, Latin America, you name it.
[00:12:35.925 --> 00:12:39.726]  As I told you, getting loans cheaper than U.S.
[00:12:39.766 --> 00:12:40.926]  companies or citizens do.
[00:12:42.126 --> 00:12:44.687]  And the private fellow at the Reserve says, oh, China can have 10% growth rates.
[00:12:44.727 --> 00:12:45.387]  We can't even have a 4.5.
[00:12:46.047 --> 00:12:47.108]  That's too fast.
[00:12:47.728 --> 00:12:49.989]  So they raise interest rates on us, but not on the CHICOMs.
[00:12:50.369 --> 00:12:51.429]  And Trump's mad about that.
[00:12:52.927 --> 00:12:53.847]  So he said it was wrong.
[00:12:55.168 --> 00:12:56.588]  And he said, I'll remove you.
[00:12:56.628 --> 00:12:57.809]  So he said, okay, I'll resign.
[00:12:58.289 --> 00:13:01.130]  That was a year and a half ago.
[00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:05.391]  October 2017, Trump made a big deal about that.
[00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:08.212]  That's an article out of Foreign Policy.
[00:13:08.232 --> 00:13:11.113]  That's basically the CFR arm of the Washington Post.
[00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:14.414]  So when you read that, that's the establishment talking.
[00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:16.395]  And now he's stepped down.
[00:13:16.415 --> 00:13:17.635]  Just another big sign.
[00:13:18.595 --> 00:13:19.696]  Jim Yong Kim
[00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.711]  Resigns as president of the World Bank.
[00:13:23.271 --> 00:13:31.516]  He will stand down by February 1st for private sector before expiring of his term in three years.
[00:13:32.756 --> 00:13:39.039]  Jim Young Kim is to step down as the head of the World Bank, sending shockwaves through the international aid community.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.680]  Oh, the aid community.
[00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:41.581]  Oh, yes.
[00:13:44.422 --> 00:13:47.464]  Aiding the destruction and the sellout of the U.S., the Panama Canal, everything else.
[00:13:47.524 --> 00:13:49.085]  And oh, he was appointed, of course, by
[00:13:50.109 --> 00:13:50.950]  The Democrats!
[00:13:53.033 --> 00:13:56.518]  He was appointed by Barack Hussein Obama!
[00:13:57.159 --> 00:14:04.330]  So all the CHICOM officers are being removed out of our country's system.
[00:14:05.478 --> 00:14:06.479]  We created the World Bank.
[00:14:06.619 --> 00:14:07.119]  We run it.
[00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:08.920]  Supposedly to spread aid to the world.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:20.508]  It's been spreading globalism and destruction of the third world and letting the Chai Koms come in and bankrolling Chinese projects all over the world to exploit populations at levels never seen.
[00:14:20.748 --> 00:14:24.451]  It makes the British and the Dutch colonialists look like angels.
[00:14:25.632 --> 00:14:27.993]  The Chinese leave nothing for anyone.
[00:14:28.013 --> 00:14:30.335]  But it's okay.
[00:14:32.662 --> 00:14:36.064]  World Bank came to resign effective February 1st.
[00:14:37.405 --> 00:14:43.808]  President Xi orders Chinese Army to prepare for war and threatens to invade Taiwan or attack U.S.
[00:14:43.848 --> 00:14:44.148]  ships.
[00:14:44.849 --> 00:14:46.129]  And today they threatened it.
[00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:49.631]  China confronts U.S.
[00:14:49.651 --> 00:14:55.114]  with fury as American missile destroyer sails through disputed South China Sea in challenge to Beijing.
[00:14:56.815 --> 00:15:00.377]  China officially threatened to attack the ships and warned Washington they may attack.
[00:15:01.823 --> 00:15:07.368]  Scrambling warships and aircraft to intercept and make threats upon the ships.
[00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:13.432]  In landmark speech, Xi threatens violence against Taiwan, demands peaceful reunification.
[00:15:16.795 --> 00:15:16.895]  U.S.
[00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:20.738]  destroyer Celsa disputed South China Sea as trade talks kick off in Beijing.
[00:15:21.299 --> 00:15:24.702]  We urge the United States to immediately cease this kind of provocation.
[00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.061]  So I think that's some pretty big news, isn't it?
[00:15:29.741 --> 00:15:35.943]  And you'd think back home in America, the average American, the average leftist would figure this out and stand with their country.
[00:15:36.163 --> 00:15:36.623]  But no.
[00:15:37.603 --> 00:15:41.785]  They have been born and bred to hate the nation by the globalists in this long-term plan to bring us down.
[00:15:42.745 --> 00:15:48.127]  And they believe Americans standing for sovereignty and the Bill of Rights and Constitution and prosperity and justice
[00:15:49.253 --> 00:15:50.834]  We're ending the year.
[00:15:50.854 --> 00:15:51.875]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[00:15:51.895 --> 00:15:53.316]  It's been an insane year.
[00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:59.779]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming, and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:28.831]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers, understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[00:16:29.872 --> 00:16:33.918]  And that the globalists wouldn't be trying to shut us down.
[00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:38.014]  If we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[00:16:38.034 --> 00:16:43.498]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:46.161]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[00:16:46.181 --> 00:16:48.483]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[00:16:50.144 --> 00:16:52.026]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[00:16:52.046 --> 00:16:54.408]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[00:16:55.288 --> 00:16:57.911]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[00:16:59.292 --> 00:17:02.375]  But our aircraft didn't have radar.
[00:17:04.738 --> 00:17:15.846]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:26.553]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[00:17:27.654 --> 00:17:33.678]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it, that they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[00:17:34.574 --> 00:17:41.779]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:47.802]  For those of you who don't know, it's Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[00:17:48.223 --> 00:17:51.765]  That's a separate battle.
[00:17:51.965 --> 00:17:59.290]  And so, they would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.532]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[00:18:03.427 --> 00:18:08.789]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flack, comes from that.
[00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:24.455]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flack is, and we find out where the biggest attack is, and what pisses them off the most, and lo and behold,
[00:18:26.255 --> 00:18:29.518]  That turns out to be the most accurate information.
[00:18:29.578 --> 00:18:33.462]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[00:18:34.565 --> 00:18:43.371]  I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[00:18:43.791 --> 00:18:56.799]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.741]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:05.899]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out.
[00:19:06.733 --> 00:19:08.014]  Until January 1st.
[00:19:08.694 --> 00:19:10.414]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support.
[00:19:11.055 --> 00:19:13.916]  Selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[00:19:14.416 --> 00:19:17.897]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[00:19:18.638 --> 00:19:21.699]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything.
[00:19:22.559 --> 00:19:24.340]  Double Patriot points on your next order.
[00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.000]  And a free t-shirt with every order.
[00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:29.662]  That is extended, but only a few days left until...
[00:19:30.945 --> 00:19:31.746]  The end of this year.
[00:19:32.606 --> 00:19:44.456]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping, and a free t-shirt, and of course, so many other great items.
[00:19:44.496 --> 00:19:50.281]  And in fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver or something like that.
[00:19:50.301 --> 00:19:55.966]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there, a true 360 win.
[00:19:56.366 --> 00:19:57.847]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:19:58.027 --> 00:19:59.649]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:20:06.681 --> 00:20:09.302]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:58.024 --> 00:21:14.253]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide as another Chi-Com operative, he certainly gave them US money for Chinese globalist projects around the world, steps down from the World Bank leadership as the head of it.
[00:21:14.933 --> 00:21:20.056]  And it's absolutely central and critical to everything for folks to understand that
[00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:27.735]  The globalists, the Rockefeller-UN combine, set up China since 1949 to take over the world economically and militarily.
[00:21:28.215 --> 00:21:29.716]  And they gave them all one-sided deals.
[00:21:29.736 --> 00:21:37.318]  We've been in Afghanistan 18 years, mainly so that China can now extract up to $44 billion a year in rare-earth minerals.
[00:21:38.719 --> 00:21:40.900]  We extract zero out of Afghanistan.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:47.822]  We're there for their security, so they can come in with their heavy equipment and mine it out, and then a few U.S.
[00:21:47.902 --> 00:21:50.543]  and global traders make money with the Chai comps.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.861]  That's how these companies are profitable.
[00:21:54.421 --> 00:21:57.982]  If you've got a hundred billion dollars on average a year of U.S.
[00:21:58.002 --> 00:22:08.206]  security in Afghanistan alone to haul all that lithium and other goodies out of there, then it's pretty profitable.
[00:22:08.226 --> 00:22:12.007]  Remember when we took over Iraq and the U.S.
[00:22:12.047 --> 00:22:15.588]  got zero of the oil, but China and France got it all?
[00:22:16.886 --> 00:22:19.207]  And everybody's saying, oh, Bush is doing it for oil.
[00:22:19.727 --> 00:22:21.808]  No, Bush was a globalist trader.
[00:22:23.548 --> 00:22:28.350]  His father set up the deal with China in the 70s to open it up and do this deal.
[00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:39.534]  George Herbert Walker, the devil, the globalist, the Democrat-Republican, the Rockefeller-Republican, he set up the deal with the Rockefellers in the 70s.
[00:22:41.455 --> 00:22:43.975]  And when Nixon balked at it being a one-sided deal, they removed him.
[00:22:44.976 --> 00:22:45.216]  Early 70s.
[00:22:47.318 --> 00:22:49.259]  Has been going on before that, but it's been official.
[00:22:49.439 --> 00:22:50.259]  So, you have to understand.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.941]  We go in and spend... What was the Iraq War?
[00:22:53.981 --> 00:22:54.601]  Three trillion?
[00:22:56.222 --> 00:22:58.963]  To secure trillions in oil for the Chai Koms.
[00:23:01.044 --> 00:23:01.705]  Nice little deal.
[00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:03.545]  But then the money's back channeled to the Bushes.
[00:23:04.126 --> 00:23:07.207]  Who walk around with cowboy hats and go, I'm a good taxi boy!
[00:23:07.287 --> 00:23:08.928]  How you doing today?
[00:23:09.188 --> 00:23:13.150]  I'm going down to Dairy Queen, having me a belt buster today!
[00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:18.671]  Think about that.
[00:23:19.052 --> 00:23:19.772]  In Iraq.
[00:23:19.873 --> 00:23:20.453]  And I could go further.
[00:23:20.713 --> 00:23:20.813]  Oh!
[00:23:21.254 --> 00:23:22.255]  Oh, who had the deal in 1980?
[00:23:22.695 --> 00:23:25.317]  The deal was signed in 1978.
[00:23:27.419 --> 00:23:33.385]  Jimmy Carter transferred the Panama Canal that no one could even build today, they think.
[00:23:34.165 --> 00:23:35.446]  Tens of thousands died building it.
[00:23:35.466 --> 00:23:36.808]  The French couldn't build 10% of it.
[00:23:36.828 --> 00:23:37.749]  We came in and built it.
[00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:39.890]  Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:23:40.831 --> 00:23:42.553]  We just gave it to him.
[00:23:45.609 --> 00:24:04.038]  Just like we gave them the missile technology, and the hydroelectric technology, and the aerospace technology, and the nanotech technology, and the genetic engineering technology, and then had regulations here, which I agree with, that didn't let us do immoral things like cloning, but let them all do it in China.
[00:24:06.059 --> 00:24:07.279]  How you like them apples?
[00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:12.362]  So this has been the complete bleeding out of America,
[00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:22.511]  Basically, taking blood transfusions from us and giving it to China, until we're now a shriveled person from these vampires, and Trump says, you know what?
[00:24:22.531 --> 00:24:23.751]  You're not gonna fully kill us.
[00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:25.632]  And they go, YOU ARE THE ENEMY!
[00:24:25.872 --> 00:24:30.513]  GET RID OF HIM, SAYS HOLLYWOOD, AND THE DEMOCRATS, AND THE NEOCONS, AND THE WOKE!
[00:24:31.513 --> 00:24:32.234]  William Crystal.
[00:24:32.494 --> 00:24:33.434]  Now the left's like, man...
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:40.363]  We like William Crystal, the neocon warmonger that was for all these evil wars and selling America out and one-sided trade deals.
[00:24:40.563 --> 00:24:46.686]  Now the Democrats on MSNBC call him woke, and hip-hop rappers go, man, you're woke, bro!
[00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:51.749]  Praising their warmonger and saying, how dare Trump?
[00:24:55.211 --> 00:24:57.692]  How dare him try to pull us out of these wars?
[00:24:57.932 --> 00:24:59.093]  How dare him, Pash?
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.881]  Criminal justice reform so black people don't get triple the sentences for the same drugs that whites use.
[00:25:05.922 --> 00:25:07.242]  How dare you?
[00:25:07.262 --> 00:25:08.883]  You literally are saying this!
[00:25:11.403 --> 00:25:14.564]  But then Kanye West comes out and says, no, I'm 100% behind Trump.
[00:25:14.604 --> 00:25:15.345]  He said he'd do that.
[00:25:15.365 --> 00:25:15.805]  He did that.
[00:25:15.825 --> 00:25:16.765]  That's a really nice thing.
[00:25:16.805 --> 00:25:21.326]  And I can't believe the Democrats helped engineer putting black people in prison.
[00:25:21.346 --> 00:25:23.367]  Hillary Clinton got it passed, called them animals.
[00:25:24.027 --> 00:25:26.568]  So they need to be brought to heel like a dog.
[00:25:27.788 --> 00:25:43.394]  So, she gets praised by people like Sean King and, you know, the new Black Panther Party and all these other groups, who we'll talk about when we come back, who are busily trying to get a race war going in this country.
[00:25:45.995 --> 00:25:48.796]  Who is that white lady that poses a black lady and she still does it?
[00:25:50.256 --> 00:25:51.257]  Rachel Dolezal.
[00:25:51.337 --> 00:25:56.719]  Every time I see this Sean King guy on the news, it's like a white guy with a little
[00:25:59.113 --> 00:26:00.274]  Eyeliner mustache?
[00:26:04.117 --> 00:26:04.798]  Dalcom X?
[00:26:05.018 --> 00:26:05.578]  Talcom X?
[00:26:05.698 --> 00:26:14.586]  I mean, I don't know what's going on here, but why is it always a white dude posing like a black guy leading black people into rioting?
[00:26:16.347 --> 00:26:22.112]  And I'm talking about, of course, all the countries on the edge of war and all this craziness is happening.
[00:26:23.673 --> 00:26:28.417]  Even after TIP, Texas Sheriff and Sean King pushed false narrative
[00:26:29.665 --> 00:26:31.507]  In Jasmine Barnes murder.
[00:26:31.947 --> 00:26:37.332]  Oh yeah, he was already arrested Saturday afternoon in front of the news cameras.
[00:26:37.712 --> 00:26:39.814]  A black guy, other shooter, black guy.
[00:26:40.415 --> 00:26:48.482]  They come in, they admit that they thought it was a mistaken identity, thought it was a drug car at 630 in the morning at this gas station, convenience store.
[00:26:48.802 --> 00:26:55.408]  They shoot the poor little girl and they were still tweeting at that time that it was a white supremacist.
[00:26:56.479 --> 00:26:59.464]  There's your white supremacist for a TV viewer, two black guys.
[00:27:00.706 --> 00:27:03.991]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, that's what this comes down to.
[00:27:04.331 --> 00:27:11.021]  And the media seizing on this, pushing this narrative, hyping it till the end of the earth, and then...
[00:27:12.822 --> 00:27:35.173]  It took them until Sunday night to start retracting, not the old stories, but saying, okay, it was a mistaken identity, probably a drug deal gone bad or something, or they thought it was a drug deal, and shot these people, and we're not going to show you mug shots, we're not going to show you, we're not going to tell you, oh, it's a black guy, we've been saying for a week it's a white guy, and there's white devils, and there's a national crime epidemic of whites killing blacks, which isn't true.
[00:27:37.874 --> 00:27:40.075]  No, they just kind of removed the story out of the news.
[00:27:40.995 --> 00:27:41.776]  And now we learn
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:28:10.394]  that Sean King last Wednesday was contacted by folks telling him exactly who the shooter and the driver were but he passed that tip on to the sheriff who sat on it and they kept putting out the composite even Saturday night after one guy was in custody and had already pled guilty.
[00:28:11.995 --> 00:28:12.595]  Did you hear that?
[00:28:14.605 --> 00:28:15.946]  Already had him!
[00:28:17.027 --> 00:28:18.848]  And the sheriff was putting out Whitey.
[00:28:18.868 --> 00:28:25.853]  Because you gotta milk it for every drop you can get in race-based politics.
[00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:30.796]  That's Sheriff Ed Gonzalez down there in the blue oasis of Houston.
[00:28:31.416 --> 00:28:32.477]  The blue sewer.
[00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:36.000]  So there you go.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:38.201]  And then you got Sean King.
[00:28:38.221 --> 00:28:39.122]  Can we put Sean King up?
[00:28:40.225 --> 00:28:48.148]  I mean, I could take a black marker and put a little thin mustache up there and then say, I mean, he looks like a famous 1940s actor.
[00:28:48.768 --> 00:28:50.389]  Who's the guy in Gone With the Wind?
[00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:52.750]  Plays Red Butler?
[00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:55.371]  I mean, that's what he actually looks like.
[00:28:56.291 --> 00:28:57.011]  It's a white dude!
[00:28:57.972 --> 00:28:59.352]  It's a white dude!
[00:29:02.264 --> 00:29:06.186]  The last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[00:29:07.166 --> 00:29:13.069]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:22.994]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[00:29:23.474 --> 00:29:24.655]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[00:29:25.235 --> 00:29:27.536]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[00:29:28.116 --> 00:29:44.269]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes, everybody knows about it on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[00:29:44.429 --> 00:29:53.436]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[00:29:54.237 --> 00:29:54.797]  But now,
[00:29:55.771 --> 00:30:14.117]  They have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[00:30:14.877 --> 00:30:17.118]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation.
[00:30:18.118 --> 00:30:21.839]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[00:30:21.859 --> 00:30:22.539]  They're patriots.
[00:30:22.979 --> 00:30:34.181]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[00:30:34.741 --> 00:30:35.561]  You drop ship it.
[00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:36.301]  You get it out.
[00:30:36.501 --> 00:30:37.381]  You have the website.
[00:30:38.001 --> 00:30:38.602]  I promote it.
[00:30:38.782 --> 00:30:39.662]  I send people there.
[00:30:39.942 --> 00:30:42.882]  And that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[00:30:43.582 --> 00:30:47.003]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[00:30:48.148 --> 00:30:57.775]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[00:30:58.555 --> 00:31:03.299]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[00:31:03.579 --> 00:31:11.665]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[00:31:12.864 --> 00:31:22.974]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp, so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado, where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[00:31:23.255 --> 00:31:25.097]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[00:31:25.137 --> 00:31:25.697]  I've researched it.
[00:31:25.737 --> 00:31:31.223]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us in the last six years.
[00:31:31.243 --> 00:31:32.644]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[00:31:33.445 --> 00:31:45.371]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:54.527]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[00:31:55.207 --> 00:32:11.438]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all, because they have more than 40 products.
[00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:14.561]  Now, remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[00:32:14.761 --> 00:32:15.762]  They've tried to shut us down.
[00:32:16.542 --> 00:32:17.743]  They've tried to boycott us.
[00:32:17.763 --> 00:32:18.564]  They've tried to sue us.
[00:32:19.084 --> 00:32:25.569]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move, not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:33.556]  We're still going to do that with Infowarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[00:32:33.636 --> 00:32:35.477]  And this is the first big one.
[00:32:35.837 --> 00:32:36.698]  So I'm very excited.
[00:32:36.718 --> 00:32:37.499]  Be sure and go there.
[00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:44.224]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[00:32:44.224 --> 00:32:46.706]  So, highest quality, the lowest prices.
[00:32:47.147 --> 00:32:52.951]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at WashingtonReserve.com, and you're helping fund the InfoWar the whole time.
[00:32:55.113 --> 00:32:57.175]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:19.606 --> 00:33:27.993]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:29.798 --> 00:33:34.320]  Okay, Roger Stone is only popping in for one segment.
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:45.245]  Because I saw it in the New York Times yesterday, and most of the time the New York Times is, you know, lying or spinning or twisting, especially when it has to do with America or Trump or the Second Amendment or Christians or anything else that's good.
[00:33:46.745 --> 00:33:53.228]  But they were saying that Roger Stone, according to insiders, was the creator of the idea of a wall.
[00:33:54.969 --> 00:33:56.570]  And so, I called Roger.
[00:33:57.711 --> 00:33:58.212]  This morning.
[00:33:58.972 --> 00:34:00.113]  And I said, is that true?
[00:34:00.474 --> 00:34:03.877]  And he said, well, yes, but let me be specific and clarify.
[00:34:04.377 --> 00:34:05.719]  And it's not about who gets the credit.
[00:34:06.339 --> 00:34:09.402]  The media is trying to spin it as a good rhetoric point, but a bad idea.
[00:34:11.044 --> 00:34:15.207]  I now more than ever think it's a great idea because it's a symbol of national sovereignty.
[00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:17.590]  It's a make work project.
[00:34:19.053 --> 00:34:21.714]  But also, it will save a lot of lives, and the U.S.
[00:34:21.734 --> 00:34:37.598]  has built walls around Iraq, we've put up fences in Afghanistan, and the idea that the Democrats are demonizing the idea that we even have borders, and that they say that it's evil, and we even have a barrier, is just ridiculous.
[00:34:37.638 --> 00:34:38.638]  So, it's a shimble.
[00:34:39.781 --> 00:34:41.142]  And he has shut the government down.
[00:34:41.162 --> 00:34:42.243]  He said he wouldn't back down.
[00:34:42.283 --> 00:34:42.683]  He hasn't.
[00:34:43.043 --> 00:34:46.946]  They try to spin it and say, well, the Democrats may agree to a metal barrier.
[00:34:47.907 --> 00:34:52.891]  If you've got 30-foot metal slats that are bars, it's a wall.
[00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:55.913]  A cell wall is a membrane.
[00:34:56.473 --> 00:34:58.215]  It's not stone or concrete or metal.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.221]  Wall can be anything.
[00:35:03.281 --> 00:35:06.563]  It's the Chinese great firewall of censorship.
[00:35:07.064 --> 00:35:13.228]  If it blocks people, if it's physical, I think steel is better than even concrete.
[00:35:13.248 --> 00:35:18.852]  And the designers have said it is the best design to not be scalable and not have people get through it.
[00:35:19.593 --> 00:35:21.674]  But they spin it like he's not keeping his promise.
[00:35:22.074 --> 00:35:24.516]  All Trump's done is kept his promises.
[00:35:25.217 --> 00:35:26.758]  Now especially trying to pull out of Iraq.
[00:35:27.944 --> 00:35:31.686]  And other areas and being blocked by out-of-control Pentagon individuals.
[00:35:32.406 --> 00:35:33.907]  He promised to get prison reform through.
[00:35:33.947 --> 00:35:34.487]  He did that.
[00:35:34.507 --> 00:35:39.330]  I mean, I'm not going to go through all the accomplishments, getting out of the TPP, getting thousands of factories to come back.
[00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:49.495]  But so we can talk to the admitted progenitor, the coiner of the wall, Roger Stone.
[00:35:49.515 --> 00:35:50.575]  Talk about an influential guy.
[00:35:50.896 --> 00:35:57.259]  Trump's chief advisor up until the middle of the campaign, hounded by Robert Mueller, also is asking him, is it true?
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:03.902]  Well, first Alex, I appreciate the opportunity because it's Donald Trump who identified
[00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.489]  I don't know.
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:44.341]  I don't think so.
[00:37:10.189 --> 00:37:18.376]  And he's the one who inserted it in his announcement speech after he came down on the escalator, for which, of course, the national press excoriated him.
[00:37:19.717 --> 00:37:21.298]  But look at the New York Times headline.
[00:37:21.998 --> 00:37:26.922]  Roger Stone invented wall as a way to remind Donald Trump to bash immigrants.
[00:37:27.563 --> 00:37:28.824]  We're not bashing immigrants.
[00:37:29.508 --> 00:37:33.694]  We want to stop the flow of 90% of the heroin and fentanyl into our country.
[00:37:33.714 --> 00:37:34.495]  Well, let's be clear.
[00:37:34.655 --> 00:37:36.778]  First, they demonize you and lie about you.
[00:37:36.798 --> 00:37:39.922]  When they take something true, that he wanted a barrier, you should call it a wall.
[00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:41.144]  You know, it's stronger.
[00:37:41.204 --> 00:37:41.905]  You're a builder.
[00:37:42.646 --> 00:37:44.428]  The iconography is more powerful.
[00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:46.149]  Yeah, nobody manipulates Donald Trump.
[00:37:46.229 --> 00:37:52.512]  And I was frankly surprised that he made immigration the centerpiece of his announcement speech, and it had the desired effect.
[00:38:12.398 --> 00:38:15.202]  And the wall, as you know, came somewhat after that.
[00:38:15.863 --> 00:38:19.808]  But it'll keep hanging tough and it's driving the Democrats insane.
[00:38:20.389 --> 00:38:24.916]  I agree with you, a metal barrier, you know, Grazer-type
[00:38:25.791 --> 00:38:27.191]  We're good to go.
[00:38:48.027 --> 00:38:55.673]  There was a major piece in yesterday's New York Times, the people versus Donald Trump making the case for impeachment, and it was pure Olinsky.
[00:38:56.233 --> 00:39:00.837]  Everything they accused Donald Trump of, every single thing, is exactly what they have done.
[00:39:01.397 --> 00:39:05.060]  What Mueller and the Clintons and the Bushes and the deep state have done.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.961]  It was Kafkaesque.
[00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:09.283]  It was like Alice in Wonderland.
[00:39:09.343 --> 00:39:10.964]  It was so out of touch with reality.
[00:39:12.526 --> 00:39:12.846]  Roger.
[00:39:14.022 --> 00:39:16.664]  Pulling back from this in just a hypocrisy, here's an example.
[00:39:17.025 --> 00:39:24.892]  Golden Globes winner decries the wall, walls surrounded by a wall of barricades and security.
[00:39:25.552 --> 00:39:36.943]  Dogs, federal police, state police, local police, border patrol, they brought them all in to guard the Hollywood turds who live behind 10 foot, 20 foot walls.
[00:39:38.524 --> 00:39:43.127]  Around their neighborhoods, then 10-foot walls around their houses, sometimes 20-foot walls.
[00:39:43.888 --> 00:39:46.710]  I know Quentin Tarantino's house because I knew somebody that lived next door to him.
[00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:57.298]  It had, Roger, 25-foot walls with spikes on it all the way around the house in the middle of the Hollywood Hills next to $10 million houses.
[00:39:57.318 --> 00:39:58.398]  His house was over $10 million.
[00:39:58.839 --> 00:40:05.484]  But this latest guy, this is on Infowars.com folks, shout out to everybody, Golden Globes winner Brad Simpson described the wall as
[00:40:06.184 --> 00:40:11.585]  Hateful last night while surrounded by a wall of barricades, security and armed police officers.
[00:40:11.905 --> 00:40:16.026]  So they were behind a 10-foot spike wall and hundreds and hundreds of police.
[00:40:16.466 --> 00:40:20.267]  He said they tell us that we should be scared of people that are different from us.
[00:40:20.827 --> 00:40:26.629]  They tell us that we should have walls around ourselves, he said, adding those forces of hate and fear are still with us.
[00:40:27.009 --> 00:40:30.570]  This is literally the globalists trying to collapse our country, Roger.
[00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:31.270]  This is crazy.
[00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.750]  We have another
[00:40:32.816 --> 00:40:35.219]  Yeah, the whole thing is extraordinarily phony.
[00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:40.024]  Let's face it, the hypocrisy, the extent to which hypocrisy is grounded
[00:40:51.266 --> 00:40:53.527]  Globalist Hollywood types is out of control.
[00:40:54.387 --> 00:40:55.728]  They travel with armed guards.
[00:40:55.828 --> 00:40:58.729]  They live behind gated communities and high walls.
[00:40:59.269 --> 00:41:00.909]  We have nothing against people of color.
[00:41:00.929 --> 00:41:02.890]  We have nothing against people from foreign countries.
[00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.890]  My wife's an immigrant.
[00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.811]  Donald Trump's wife is an immigrant.
[00:41:06.291 --> 00:41:08.372]  But there's a legal way to come to America.
[00:41:08.972 --> 00:41:09.692]  Barriers are part of
[00:41:33.661 --> 00:41:37.362]  Territorialism, part of security, part of privacy in any civilization.
[00:41:37.642 --> 00:41:39.642]  We all have front doors for a reason.
[00:41:40.582 --> 00:41:42.923]  We all have screens on the windows for a reason.
[00:41:43.423 --> 00:41:45.503]  That's why we have locks on our corridors.
[00:41:45.723 --> 00:41:46.783]  Everyone gets this.
[00:41:47.483 --> 00:41:58.205]  And I just can't believe the mantra of your white supremacist, that's what they're talking about the Democrats, by Nancy Pelosi and Cortez, is that the wall is a monument to white supremacy.
[00:41:58.986 --> 00:42:01.486]  No, I think it's a wall to sovereignty and survival.
[00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:05.688]  Well, Donald Trump has said it dozens and dozens of times.
[00:42:05.748 --> 00:42:08.033]  If you don't have borders, you don't have a country.
[00:42:09.496 --> 00:42:12.984]  And I'm very proud of the way he's hung tough on this in the face of
[00:42:14.086 --> 00:42:30.099]  Well, Roger, stay right there, because I said we don't do one segment.
[00:42:30.119 --> 00:42:30.740]  You've got to go.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:39.146]  But I want to do a few more minutes on the side, because we didn't get into Mueller breaking into your trash can, all the latest, his final report, supposedly coming out next month, how desperate he is.
[00:42:39.887 --> 00:42:48.351]  And I also want to play that clip, as I mentioned it, of MSNBC reporter, AP reporter, on MSNBC saying there is no caravan.
[00:42:49.071 --> 00:42:50.212]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:42:50.232 --> 00:42:57.976]  And then more on two black dudes now admit they shot the poor little black girl and the white folks are still getting blamed.
[00:42:57.996 --> 00:42:58.616]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:12.443 --> 00:43:14.645]  I'm now joined by Leo Zagami.
[00:43:15.285 --> 00:43:16.646]  LeoZagami.com.
[00:43:16.666 --> 00:43:19.288]  He's got a lot of great books that you can find there.
[00:43:19.308 --> 00:43:20.289]  A lot of great stories.
[00:43:20.549 --> 00:43:25.293]  And he is, for me, the resident expert when it comes to all things Vatican.
[00:43:25.353 --> 00:43:26.394]  So he joins me today.
[00:43:26.574 --> 00:43:31.518]  Now, the story here is, they're calling him a medium, miracle healer, whatever you want to say.
[00:43:31.758 --> 00:43:35.520]  Very famous in Brazil, known as Jao de Jus, John of God.
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:39.963]  He was interviewed once on the Oprah Winfrey Show, treated President Bill Clinton.
[00:43:40.223 --> 00:43:46.726]  So it comes out though that this guy was basically ritualistically abusing, apparently sexually assaulting women.
[00:43:47.026 --> 00:43:48.687]  Over 300 according to this report.
[00:43:48.707 --> 00:43:49.888]  It's a big story right now going on.
[00:43:50.048 --> 00:43:58.713]  And so Leo, while they are basically interrogating this person, and they're interrogating him, Leo, and all of a sudden weird crazy stuff starts to happen.
[00:43:59.253 --> 00:44:12.237]  Circuits start to explode, computers start to take a mind of its own, and so now the police interrogating this person are basically, like, kind of going through, like, some sort of, like, let's say, exorcism, and they're just having to remain extra focused just to even get this interrogation completed.
[00:44:12.277 --> 00:44:16.758]  But, Leo, talk about how this is not something new and how this is something very real.
[00:44:16.778 --> 00:44:25.861]  I mean, people can see this, you know, they talk about exorcisms and stuff, but, I mean, these demons, these, we'll call them interdimensional demons, a lot of people in Hollywood try to communicate with them, a lot of people in
[00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:30.365]  Already, I think over 10 years ago, this John of God appeared in various forums denounced as a pedophile.
[00:44:30.465 --> 00:44:34.529]  So why did they let him do what he has done up until now?
[00:44:51.325 --> 00:45:03.830]  Brazil is a place full of witch doctors and of black magic, and I mean the extra-dimensional powers that you are approaching with these rituals are taken very seriously, especially in Brazil.
[00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:06.071]  And so this explains to you that there is a
[00:45:06.651 --> 00:45:14.740]  Very particular situation going on, but they are extra-dimensional entities because they are coming from other worlds.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:21.408]  They are coming from other worlds, invited from this plane of existence thanks to rituals or thanks
[00:45:21.608 --> 00:45:32.594]  Thanks to specific places, because there is a sort of stargate, doors to unknown dimensions that have always been there since ancient times.
[00:45:32.654 --> 00:45:35.435]  But you have higher realms and lower realms.
[00:45:35.535 --> 00:45:44.240]  So you have the angelic beings on top, but you have also the demonic ones below that are the ones who actually control matter.
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:52.182]  So most of these Illuminati, if you want to define them as Illuminati, they are members of various secret societies.
[00:45:52.562 --> 00:46:00.224]  They base their power on low-level demons that they maintain control over for hundreds of years.
[00:46:00.324 --> 00:46:06.726]  And that means that their secret society has made a specific, maybe, deal with those demons or with that demon.
[00:46:07.206 --> 00:46:11.427]  And they maintain that relationship through sacrifices of various kinds.
[00:46:11.567 --> 00:46:25.382]  I actually met Catholic bishops who were linked to black magic, Brazilian sects, and they were involved in all these things that are well beyond the ordinary deacon magic.
[00:46:25.763 --> 00:46:33.191]  We're talking here about very serious forms of witchcraft based on ancient grimoires that are very dangerous.
[00:46:33.351 --> 00:46:39.917]  And I think that that is what probably the story is with this John of God, Jao de Jus, down in Brazil.
[00:46:40.117 --> 00:46:48.243]  He probably made some deals with the devil and these demons are trying to do whatever they can to disrupt God's justice coming to this man who has been accused of assaulting over 300 women.
[00:46:48.504 --> 00:46:49.565]  Leo Zegami, thank you so much.
[00:46:49.605 --> 00:46:50.966]  Great stuff as always, Leo.
[00:46:51.006 --> 00:46:52.867]  Get his new book, The Invisible Master.
[00:46:53.168 --> 00:46:54.669]  leozegami.com is his website.
[00:47:06.031 --> 00:47:08.650]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:35.456 --> 00:47:46.624]  You can see the vanguard of thousands of illegal aliens from Central and South America trying to break over the Mexico-San Diego border.
[00:47:47.104 --> 00:47:48.025]  This is still ongoing.
[00:47:48.045 --> 00:47:49.006]  This is from a few weeks ago.
[00:47:49.026 --> 00:47:52.409]  There's more footage of it happening at night just last weekend, as everybody knows.
[00:47:53.729 --> 00:48:02.052]  But according to MSNBC guest, AP White House reporter claims migrant caravan never reached the U.S.
[00:48:02.092 --> 00:48:02.412]  border.
[00:48:03.092 --> 00:48:05.873]  She's trying to get the job from Jim Acosta for Biggest Liar.
[00:48:06.173 --> 00:48:07.533]  He says it doesn't exist.
[00:48:08.634 --> 00:48:13.895]  Remember when he grabs the microphone back and then they said that was fake footage we put out.
[00:48:15.075 --> 00:48:16.676]  Texas Monthly gave me the Bumsteer Award.
[00:48:17.922 --> 00:48:20.464]  I'm gonna cover the magazine for putting out a fake video.
[00:48:20.924 --> 00:48:22.665]  Any moron can see we just zoomed in.
[00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.967]  I'm telling you, these people are next level.
[00:48:25.647 --> 00:48:26.768]  The caravans are real.
[00:48:27.108 --> 00:48:27.989]  Bigger ones are coming.
[00:48:28.629 --> 00:48:30.030]  The UN is sponsoring them.
[00:48:30.350 --> 00:48:32.252]  And then they have the nerve to say it doesn't exist.
[00:48:32.292 --> 00:48:32.692]  Here she is.
[00:48:33.746 --> 00:48:38.631]  From the back and forth on where you want the wall and whether the wall would be in California.
[00:48:38.651 --> 00:48:47.899]  And what I heard from the White House Press Secretary this morning, Communications Director Sarah Sanders, Press Secretary, was a lot of fear mongering.
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.704]  Sarah Sanders saying this morning 4,000 terrorists are apprehended at the border every day.
[00:48:52.744 --> 00:48:53.344]  That's not true.
[00:48:53.384 --> 00:48:55.807]  Jacob Soboroff will fact check that for us in a moment.
[00:48:56.287 --> 00:49:02.910]  But the President's also talking about smugglers and talking about all the crime that pours in on the border.
[00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:07.672]  Is this just all about making it seem like there is a crisis?
[00:49:07.992 --> 00:49:08.872]  Is that their strategy?
[00:49:08.952 --> 00:49:14.215]  It certainly seemed, I mean, certainly the President's remarks right there, rambling as they were, were delivered like a campaign speech.
[00:49:14.315 --> 00:49:16.316]  It wasn't like an update to reporters about legislation.
[00:49:16.596 --> 00:49:19.377]  It was the same rhetoric we've often heard about him discussing how this
[00:49:19.697 --> 00:49:20.298]  That's Jonathan!
[00:49:38.453 --> 00:49:42.996]  Lurmi, AP reporter, and then Katie Turd, that's actually her name, T-U-R-D.
[00:49:43.296 --> 00:49:43.897]  These people.
[00:49:44.457 --> 00:49:45.398]  What'd you change your name?
[00:49:45.418 --> 00:49:46.319]  Okay, that's fake news.
[00:49:46.359 --> 00:49:47.259]  Her name's Katie Turd.
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.121]  But, I mean, what an incredible liar.
[00:49:52.083 --> 00:49:56.466]  You've got 200,000 dead in Mexico, hundreds of thousands they can't find, mass graves everywhere.
[00:49:57.166 --> 00:50:06.713]  Venezuela, they ate their dogs and cats three years ago, a thousand starving to death a day, total war all over the place, society collapsing, even the few safe zones breaking down, like Cancun.
[00:50:08.613 --> 00:50:10.856]  And they're up there saying it doesn't exist!
[00:50:11.797 --> 00:50:12.458]  Show again.
[00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:17.952]  What do you make of this, Roger, where they go next level?
[00:50:18.032 --> 00:50:19.634]  When are we going to hit peak lying?
[00:50:20.234 --> 00:50:23.157]  And as a political strategist, I know you to tell the truth or I wouldn't work with you.
[00:50:23.237 --> 00:50:24.378]  They always call you a dirty trickster.
[00:50:24.398 --> 00:50:25.618]  You kind of play along with it.
[00:50:25.639 --> 00:50:28.100]  I guess you want the mystique so the ladies think that's cool.
[00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:34.606]  But I actually know you to be a straight shooter and not even want to fudge anything, which is good because that's how you lose credibility.
[00:50:34.826 --> 00:50:37.188]  They point at you and me and call us fake news.
[00:50:37.448 --> 00:50:40.971]  And these people are literally out there with their butt hanging out.
[00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:42.756]  Saying that the sky isn't blue.
[00:50:43.237 --> 00:50:44.181]  What is this tactic?
[00:50:44.221 --> 00:50:45.706]  Or is this just desperation?
[00:50:45.746 --> 00:50:46.368]  Or what is this?
[00:50:47.108 --> 00:50:49.730]  You know, unfortunately, it's a two-part strategy, Alex.
[00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:58.658]  They have, you know, access to the airwaves, access to the Internet, and they spend their lives in an outrageous campaign of propaganda and distortion.
[00:50:59.279 --> 00:51:01.201]  At the same time, they're trying to silence us.
[00:51:01.261 --> 00:51:03.243]  They want to take InfoWars off the Internet.
[00:51:03.263 --> 00:51:05.985]  They want to take us off the social media platforms.
[00:51:06.666 --> 00:51:12.411]  It's not just us, it's just hundreds of thousands of individual, if not millions, individual conservatives.
[00:51:12.851 --> 00:51:14.391]  Libertarians, Trump supporters.
[00:51:14.851 --> 00:51:16.332]  And let there be no mistake about it.
[00:51:16.492 --> 00:51:21.673]  If they take me down, if they take you down, if they take the Infowars down, Tucker Carlson's right behind us.
[00:51:22.073 --> 00:51:23.033]  So is Sean Hannity.
[00:51:23.513 --> 00:51:25.193]  They're already trying to take Mike Savage down.
[00:51:25.873 --> 00:51:26.593]  Rush Limbaugh.
[00:51:27.634 --> 00:51:28.374]  Laura Ingraham.
[00:51:28.954 --> 00:51:29.914]  All the people I love.
[00:51:29.954 --> 00:51:31.634]  All the people who are telling the truth.
[00:51:32.034 --> 00:51:32.895]  They're all targeted.
[00:51:33.095 --> 00:51:38.055]  So they have a better chance of spinning their lies if they can silence us.
[00:51:39.036 --> 00:51:41.316]  So it's a two-part strategy, and it's insidious.
[00:51:42.324 --> 00:51:46.670]  They really want to grab control of the political narrative which they lost control of in 2016.
[00:51:57.404 --> 00:52:03.786]  Southern Poverty Law Center operative or something, which literally took down Franklin Graham off Facebook and they had to take it back, they said, for dehumanization.
[00:52:05.027 --> 00:52:07.628]  Ali Alexander was threatened by a Marxist, said, I'm going to come kill you.
[00:52:08.128 --> 00:52:09.769]  He said, well, be ready for the ambulance.
[00:52:10.329 --> 00:52:15.051]  Twitter suspended at Ali Alexander, who's a political strategist and a great guy.
[00:52:15.291 --> 00:52:16.151]  Jack Posobiec tweeted it.
[00:52:16.571 --> 00:52:21.473]  I was asked not to talk about it because they want to try to fix it behind the scenes, but now that it's broken, I'm going to go ahead and cover it.
[00:52:21.813 --> 00:52:23.934]  Ali Alexander permanently banned on Twitter.
[00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:24.194]  Roger?
[00:52:25.453 --> 00:52:28.515]  Look, they banned me a year ago, more than a year ago.
[00:52:28.535 --> 00:52:33.938]  I had 450,000 followers because I hurt Kick Tapper's delicate feelings.
[00:52:34.578 --> 00:52:35.779]  Their rules are elastic.
[00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:39.301]  They only apply for conservatives, libertarians, info warriors.
[00:52:40.222 --> 00:52:43.884]  When they advocate violence or when they advocate pedophilia,
[00:52:44.814 --> 00:52:49.816]  As Mindy Robinson has exposed right here on the Alex Jones Show, that's no problem at all.
[00:52:49.857 --> 00:52:51.377]  Those people don't get banned.
[00:52:51.497 --> 00:52:57.040]  The people with a little blue checkmark who spew hate, who advocate violence, they're untouched.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:03.443]  But if you are a conservative, they will invent reasons to censor you and take you off the platform.
[00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.391]  Well, I love how they left the guy up that said, I'm going to come kill you.
[00:53:08.091 --> 00:53:09.352]  And then you're like, OK, well, get ready.
[00:53:09.372 --> 00:53:10.572]  You're going to be leaving in an ambulance.
[00:53:11.252 --> 00:53:12.593]  That's a normal response.
[00:53:15.694 --> 00:53:19.475]  But see, that's the ultimate crime to a leftist is to say, I will defend myself against you.
[00:53:20.976 --> 00:53:23.997]  Yeah, no, it's obvious that it is very contrived.
[00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:32.220]  The president needs to direct his Department of Justice to undertake antitrust action immediately against these social media giants.
[00:53:32.896 --> 00:53:45.863]  His prospects for re-election, the prospects for the passage of the rest of his reform agenda, his re-election, even his legacy, all dependent on access to a free, vibrant, robust, unfettered internet.
[00:53:45.944 --> 00:53:55.129]  Isn't it good news that Louie Gohmert, and I want to shift gears briefly and let you get back to the reporters you've got there on this very subject, internet censorship, Gohmert said to
[00:53:56.741 --> 00:54:03.385]  Sundar Pichai, basically, I know you're lying, and we're going to strip your immunity under Section 230 away.
[00:54:03.705 --> 00:54:04.505]  You are censoring.
[00:54:04.745 --> 00:54:15.231]  And now we have all these new internal Google emails from high-level folks admitting it, and then they're publicly in news, vice presidents admitting that they're putting down searches that are negative for Democrats.
[00:54:15.952 --> 00:54:18.413]  I mean, this is, this is, I've never seen such naked lying.
[00:54:19.213 --> 00:54:23.756]  Well, in fact, it's a perfect segue because Adam Schiff and the House Democrats
[00:54:24.495 --> 00:54:34.040]  Uh, want, uh, Robert Mueller to prosecute me for perjury when I sat there with you and we watched Cinder Pie under oath tell you lie after lie after lie.
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:34.400]  China?
[00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:36.161]  I couldn't even find it on a map, he said.
[00:54:36.442 --> 00:54:37.502]  We're not working in China.
[00:54:38.022 --> 00:54:39.843]  Oh no, we're not tracking anybody.
[00:54:39.863 --> 00:54:44.946]  Uh, there's no effort to disadvantage conservatives or Republicans in our Google search.
[00:54:45.386 --> 00:54:49.509]  I mean, this guy perjured himself repeatedly and he will pay no penalty whatsoever.
[00:54:49.989 --> 00:54:53.591]  Meanwhile, Swalwell and Mueller and the boys are trying to invent
[00:54:54.311 --> 00:54:55.692]  And that brings us to the final point.
[00:54:55.712 --> 00:54:57.793]  It's all over the news that they're getting in your trash.
[00:54:57.813 --> 00:54:59.013]  Somebody gets in the trash at my house.
[00:54:59.053 --> 00:55:00.354]  Neighbors have seen it.
[00:55:00.374 --> 00:55:01.094]  We've caught it on video.
[00:55:13.851 --> 00:55:15.011]  They're breaking into your trash.
[00:55:15.372 --> 00:55:17.392]  This means Mueller is really, really desperate.
[00:55:17.852 --> 00:55:21.033]  You think they're going to try to cook up a perjury trap on you, or what do you think?
[00:55:21.194 --> 00:55:28.136]  Well, I think it's going to be very hard because I've had some of the best attorneys in the country look at my testimony and they just don't see it.
[00:55:28.937 --> 00:55:31.980]  Uh, to the extent that I made errors, they would be errors in my favor.
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:42.508]  Meaning, I did forget that I had exculpatory text messages in an old cell phone that proved definitively that Randy Credico was my source regarding the significance of the October release.
[00:55:42.528 --> 00:55:42.788]  Exactly.
[00:55:42.808 --> 00:55:44.930]  So you found evidence backing up what you said.
[00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:47.732]  You can't be... In fact, you have such a great memory on all this, it blows me away.
[00:55:47.752 --> 00:55:48.413]  I have a great memory.
[00:55:48.733 --> 00:55:49.914]  I can't remember half this stuff.
[00:55:50.595 --> 00:55:51.555]  But Roger, regardless...
[00:55:52.397 --> 00:55:55.365]  Mueller, it looks like, is going to come up completely empty because there's nothing there.
[00:55:55.606 --> 00:56:00.359]  Or will they try to use Corsi, completely discredited, to then bear false witness?
[00:56:01.158 --> 00:56:02.439]  Well, that was, I think, their plan.
[00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:09.563]  Their plan appears to have fallen apart when he refused to plead to one count of giving me emails that he never gave me.
[00:56:09.923 --> 00:56:17.068]  But Alex, for those who say this is wrapping up, I point out that the judge just extended the grand jury for Mr. Mueller by another six months.
[00:56:17.828 --> 00:56:26.714]  So you wonder whether it's ever going to wrap up, and you wonder whether Mr. Mueller is focused on Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, myself.
[00:56:27.675 --> 00:56:28.136]  Who knows?
[00:56:28.197 --> 00:56:31.409]  I mean, it is exactly as the President said, a witch hunt.
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:36.703]  And a whole new round of House Intelligence Committee means more giant legal bills for me.
[00:56:37.203 --> 00:56:41.185]  I mean, I lost my health and life insurance in December because I couldn't pay the premiums.
[00:56:41.525 --> 00:56:42.146]  No, I understand.
[00:56:42.166 --> 00:56:45.047]  And then they lie and say you're worth... They do the same thing to me.
[00:56:45.267 --> 00:56:46.608]  They lie and say you're worth $10 million.
[00:56:46.628 --> 00:56:48.029]  They just make... They say, net worth.
[00:56:48.049 --> 00:56:51.811]  He's put up a fake number on the Internet, and then no one supports you because they think you've got all this money.
[00:56:52.211 --> 00:56:58.294]  Roger doesn't want to get into details here, but he lost his house, and they... You don't want to make them happy, but just tell them, Roger, they've almost bankrupted you.
[00:56:58.514 --> 00:57:00.035]  You've lost all your lobbying clients.
[00:57:00.255 --> 00:57:01.316]  They're running you into the ground.
[00:57:02.405 --> 00:57:03.346]  That's the whole plan.
[00:57:03.406 --> 00:57:06.368]  They try to weaken you so you don't have the resources to fight.
[00:57:06.888 --> 00:57:10.230]  And then, like Mike Flynn, you're forced to plead guilty to something you didn't do.
[00:57:10.631 --> 00:57:13.252]  People can go to StoneDefenseFund.com and help me.
[00:57:13.553 --> 00:57:14.994]  You've been an enormous help, Alex.
[00:57:15.454 --> 00:57:16.815]  So has everyone at InfoWars.
[00:57:16.915 --> 00:57:18.036]  I am fighting for my life.
[00:57:18.076 --> 00:57:19.757]  They try to crush you financially.
[00:57:20.097 --> 00:57:23.299]  No, I'm not worth $20 million or $10 million or $1 million.
[00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.761]  That's all fake news on the internet.
[00:57:26.806 --> 00:57:28.887]  Believe me, the stuff they say about me is pure crap.
[00:57:28.947 --> 00:57:37.211]  I mean, yeah, you can technically say all the equipment, all the everything is, you know, worth... You can say intellectual property could be extended out to be worth $10 million.
[00:57:37.231 --> 00:57:39.172]  There isn't $10 million sitting there in a bank.
[00:57:39.493 --> 00:57:42.194]  But they say that so we don't get support, but the listeners understand it's not true.
[00:57:42.454 --> 00:57:43.174]  They stand with us.
[00:57:43.254 --> 00:57:44.075]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:44.135 --> 00:57:45.896]  We need your support as well there.
[00:57:46.116 --> 00:57:46.816]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:46.836 --> 00:57:47.337]  Thank you, Roger.
[00:57:59.079 --> 00:58:00.820]  Let's go to Wildman in Illinois.
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:03.162]  Thanks for holding, and not to say Happy New Year.
[00:58:03.202 --> 00:58:03.482]  Go ahead.
[00:58:03.782 --> 00:58:13.269]  Alex, yeah, going into 2019, what Trump's got to do to save America, he's got to declassify FISA, expose the corruption, arrest the traitors, and arrest the pedophiles.
[00:58:13.329 --> 00:58:14.470]  That's how he saves America.
[00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:18.273]  My opinion, an over-the-road trucker, hard-working, honest man, that's what I believe.
[00:58:18.513 --> 00:58:18.833]  I agree.
[00:58:18.913 --> 00:58:19.654]  Victory or death.
[00:58:19.714 --> 00:58:21.375]  He's now, looks like he's cleaning house.
[00:58:21.715 --> 00:58:23.215]  He's getting rid of all the double agents.
[00:58:23.235 --> 00:58:26.297]  And the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[00:58:26.677 --> 00:58:28.958]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[00:58:28.978 --> 00:58:30.679]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[00:58:30.739 --> 00:58:31.279]  It's already begun.
[00:58:31.299 --> 00:58:33.381]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[00:58:33.901 --> 00:58:39.203]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[00:58:39.564 --> 00:58:40.184]  So just get ready.
[00:58:40.484 --> 00:58:40.945]  I'd say.
[00:58:41.005 --> 00:58:44.608]  Another note, I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[00:58:44.828 --> 00:58:47.291]  I'm a loyal supporter, and thanks for great products.
[00:58:47.471 --> 00:58:48.472]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[00:58:48.552 --> 00:58:49.773]  I want to thank you.
[00:58:49.953 --> 00:58:57.260]  If folks like you didn't stand with us against the incredible Hillary Clinton and Soros attacks, which they admit they're running, we would not be here now.
[00:58:57.941 --> 00:58:59.382]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[00:59:00.483 --> 00:59:00.984]  They're taking
[00:59:01.144 --> 00:59:01.524]  Everybody.
[00:59:01.564 --> 00:59:03.364]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[00:59:03.404 --> 00:59:06.505]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[00:59:06.545 --> 00:59:08.465]  That's why this is a war.
[00:59:08.985 --> 00:59:10.486]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[00:59:10.726 --> 00:59:12.046]  Which products do you like the best?
[00:59:12.166 --> 00:59:13.766]  Man, I use the bodies.
[00:59:13.846 --> 00:59:15.046]  I got so many t-shirts.
[00:59:15.066 --> 00:59:16.147]  It ain't even funny.
[00:59:16.207 --> 00:59:20.807]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat, on my GPS, on my truck.
[00:59:21.267 --> 00:59:24.828]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[00:59:25.128 --> 00:59:26.268]  I spread the word about you.
[00:59:26.448 --> 00:59:28.869]  I wear your clothes, your hats, your shirts.
[00:59:29.069 --> 00:59:29.529]  You name it.
[00:59:30.169 --> 00:59:31.350]  Multitude of products.
[00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:35.313]  How much love do you get versus, how much love versus hate do you get?
[00:59:35.353 --> 00:59:42.239]  Um, you know, it's, uh, people skeptical, but, like, it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[00:59:42.299 --> 00:59:45.082]  I just, I guess so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[00:59:56.562 --> 01:00:00.805]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:01.025 --> 01:00:25.243]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:26.152 --> 01:00:33.501]  I'm going to play this important report that John Bowne put together on Taiwan facing a Chinese offensive, a CHICOM offensive.
[01:00:34.222 --> 01:00:35.804]  When we come back, start your engines.
[01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:41.911]  I've mentioned a lot of this news, but I'm going to go into Ruth Bader Ginsburg not showing up after her cancer surgery.
[01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:45.516]  I'm going to get into the Young Turks caught in more incredible race baiting.
[01:00:46.912 --> 01:00:50.093]  I'm going to get into Alexander Cortez and the craziness she's involved in.
[01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:52.914]  This poor little black girl killed by two black men.
[01:00:52.975 --> 01:00:53.815]  They pled guilty.
[01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:56.076]  And the media is trying to cover it up now.
[01:00:56.116 --> 01:00:58.517]  And it turns out the sheriff knew three days before.
[01:00:58.717 --> 01:01:02.418]  And basically, it looks like, well, he knew and nothing was done.
[01:01:02.478 --> 01:01:02.919]  It's crazy.
[01:01:02.939 --> 01:01:04.019]  He kept saying it was a white guy.
[01:01:04.699 --> 01:01:07.260]  So we're going to break all that down on the other side.
[01:01:07.561 --> 01:01:08.461]  But here is the report.
[01:01:10.062 --> 01:01:13.363]  They've had everything from the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Texas Monthly.
[01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:21.112]  Try to piss down the backs of the American people and tell them that InfoWars had a horrible year.
[01:01:22.633 --> 01:01:37.200]  InfoWars had an amazing year of being directly over the target and predicting the launch of nationalism worldwide, the rebirth of populism, and that the globals would try to kill the economy and that they would try to collapse our borders.
[01:01:37.561 --> 01:01:39.942]  We're proud to be here telling the truth.
[01:01:41.454 --> 01:01:43.516]  We're proud to be here, standing firm for this nation.
[01:01:43.816 --> 01:01:53.302]  Now, because you'd think this would be top story on the New York Times or Washington Post, I saw this this morning, and I went, wow, let me type that into Google and Bing, and there was nothing being said.
[01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:56.485]  And I said, well, I don't just believe Zero Hedge.
[01:01:56.565 --> 01:01:59.507]  I said, not that they're bad, but Ronald Reagan said for us to verify.
[01:02:00.962 --> 01:02:03.264]  So I searched what they said, and guess what?
[01:02:03.284 --> 01:02:05.145]  It was in the People's Daily.
[01:02:05.185 --> 01:02:08.487]  It was in the official statements of the Communist Party of China.
[01:02:08.847 --> 01:02:10.628]  And in fact, I'd seen a lot of this the last week.
[01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:15.492]  The dictator for life, Xi, saying, you know, hey, we already took over Hong Kong.
[01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:19.775]  We'll invade Taiwan, which we have a defense agreement with, and it has weapons.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.621]  Including high-tech anti-aircraft and anti-ship.
[01:02:23.001 --> 01:02:34.905]  And that was a whole story in and of itself, that he's threatening, oh I'm sorry, not just to invade Taiwan, and meeting at the big communist bureau with live video feeds with him chanting, we're ready for war.
[01:02:35.605 --> 01:02:37.205]  There's almost no U.S.
[01:02:37.305 --> 01:02:41.787]  media coverage, and if there is, it's pro-Beijing!
[01:02:44.905 --> 01:02:48.606]  I mean, it's like this one story I could do 10 hours.
[01:02:48.666 --> 01:02:52.247]  Emergency broadcast on air, oh my god, look at their weapons, look at what they're doing.
[01:02:52.407 --> 01:02:56.068]  In landmark speech, Xi threatens violence against Taiwan.
[01:02:56.088 --> 01:03:00.089]  And I didn't just believe this, I went and read it in the damn commie newspaper.
[01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.490]  Demands peaceful reunification.
[01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:09.132]  So he says, we're ready to invade Taiwan, we're ready to blast US forces, we're ready to invade wherever we want.
[01:03:09.372 --> 01:03:17.965]  He even said we're going to take islands and physically hold them that in 2,000-year-old maps the Chinese never even laid claim to in the Philippines.
[01:03:18.025 --> 01:03:20.108]  Oh, I'm sure the Filipinos will roll over to that.
[01:03:21.050 --> 01:03:21.570]  I'm joking.
[01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:23.071]  Didn't go too well for the Japanese.
[01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:26.052]  So, this guy is on his power trip.
[01:03:26.072 --> 01:03:27.172]  And let's go through this article.
[01:03:27.492 --> 01:03:29.133]  Him at the meetings, the videos.
[01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:32.994]  Show it to TV viewers, because he's up there with all of them lined up in their weird black suits and everything.
[01:03:33.755 --> 01:03:37.296]  And you read these quotes by him, and he says, we've already taken Hong Kong.
[01:03:37.576 --> 01:03:38.636]  We're going to take Taiwan.
[01:03:38.656 --> 01:03:40.177]  We'll use forces if we need to.
[01:03:40.557 --> 01:03:41.837]  Our militaries are based there.
[01:03:42.177 --> 01:03:42.718]  If the U.S.
[01:03:42.738 --> 01:03:48.840]  tries to block us and enlist these islands that are down in Vietnam and off the coast, we're talking, like,
[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:54.742]  Hundreds of yards off the coast of the Philippines that we're gonna start attacking U.S.
[01:03:54.782 --> 01:03:55.042]  ships.
[01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:56.183]  So here's the announcement.
[01:03:56.743 --> 01:04:10.708]  The dictator who heads up a communist dictatorship that's killed five times what Hitler did is threatening to preemptively invade Taiwan and attack the United States.
[01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:14.190]  And that's not the top story in the United States.
[01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:17.091]  It's a billion, 400 million people
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:20.181]  They've got thousands of nuclear weapons.
[01:04:20.221 --> 01:04:22.882]  They've got missiles that can hit us because Clinton gave it to them.
[01:04:22.962 --> 01:04:26.224]  The average American better start getting what's going on.
[01:04:26.244 --> 01:04:27.545]  They've been shooting at our ships.
[01:04:27.585 --> 01:04:28.946]  They've been attacking our submarines.
[01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:33.188]  And man, in some cases, they're 800 miles away from China.
[01:04:33.868 --> 01:04:39.431]  And then he goes over and does a video newscast threatening to preemptively attack the U.S.
[01:04:40.632 --> 01:04:43.413]  I mean, this is like way past the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:04:43.733 --> 01:04:44.714]  This is insane.
[01:05:03.542 --> 01:05:04.683]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:05:05.203 --> 01:05:06.384]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:08.006]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[01:05:08.446 --> 01:05:09.547]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:10.488 --> 01:05:14.752]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:15.392 --> 01:05:18.615]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:27.263]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:28.184 --> 01:05:30.605]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[01:05:30.985 --> 01:05:37.547]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[01:05:38.247 --> 01:05:42.129]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:48.090]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:05:48.151 --> 01:05:50.971]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[01:05:51.191 --> 01:05:52.432]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:05:52.692 --> 01:05:55.713]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment!
[01:05:57.898 --> 01:06:03.021]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit!
[01:06:13.185 --> 01:06:17.608]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:18.128 --> 01:06:19.969]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:24.451]  Well, all last week...
[01:06:27.745 --> 01:06:51.437]  The top news story in Texas and one of the biggest stories in the United States was that a vicious knuckle-dragging white supremacist at 6 30 in the morning in Houston Texas last Sunday pumped a bunch of rounds into a family car with a mother and her two daughters shooting one of the poor little girls in the head who died basically on the spot.
[01:06:52.437 --> 01:06:53.978]  A tragedy anyway you slice it.
[01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:55.679]  I don't care what color they are.
[01:06:57.674 --> 01:07:03.457]  I'll never forget four or five years ago, there was a black lady scared by checkpoints in D.C.
[01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:12.443]  that happened to have military at them for some drill, and she drove away from it, and an overzealous cop shot her.
[01:07:13.356 --> 01:07:14.036]  I think it was terrible.
[01:07:14.056 --> 01:07:22.619]  When I said that, and she was black, there was this overwhelming outpouring of appreciation from black folks on the email and phone calls.
[01:07:22.659 --> 01:07:29.242]  I mean, thousands of emails, hundreds of calls to the comment center, letters coming in, saying, oh, we know you're good now.
[01:07:29.302 --> 01:07:31.743]  Thanks for standing up for her when she was black.
[01:07:31.803 --> 01:07:36.485]  And I said, because that was in the middle of the Trayvon Martin stuff and the Justice Department trying to foam in a race war.
[01:07:36.745 --> 01:07:37.405]  We have the documents.
[01:07:39.617 --> 01:07:41.837]  And M. Fullworth criticized it.
[01:07:42.218 --> 01:07:46.779]  Congress gives standing ovation to the cop that executed the unarmed mother.
[01:07:48.239 --> 01:07:49.219]  She had a panic attack.
[01:07:49.279 --> 01:07:49.799]  It was wrong.
[01:07:50.239 --> 01:07:51.199]  The cop was badly trained.
[01:07:51.219 --> 01:07:51.860]  He should get in trouble.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:56.221]  And people are like, whoa, she's black.
[01:07:56.261 --> 01:07:56.801]  Why do you care?
[01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:59.641]  I don't care if she's black or white or whoever the hell she is.
[01:08:01.482 --> 01:08:02.442]  I don't think like that.
[01:08:02.502 --> 01:08:05.322]  Like, oh, let's abort all the black kids, but not the white kids.
[01:08:06.063 --> 01:08:07.403]  That's the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:08:08.797 --> 01:08:11.660]  The Democratic Party, that's Planned Parenthood, that's their mission!
[01:08:12.401 --> 01:08:13.202]  Their real mission!
[01:08:13.402 --> 01:08:14.303]  Look up the history book!
[01:08:16.986 --> 01:08:29.361]  So, it's Sunday morning, and I get up again at about 5 in the morning, and I go to the computer,
[01:08:31.058 --> 01:08:32.039]  And I go to CNN.
[01:08:32.159 --> 01:08:33.140]  I check them a lot, too.
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:33.920]  See what the enemy's doing.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.582]  And it's just all this race baiting.
[01:08:35.942 --> 01:08:37.303]  All the Trump supporters are racist.
[01:08:37.343 --> 01:08:37.963]  They're all evil.
[01:08:37.983 --> 01:08:38.504]  They're all bad.
[01:08:38.524 --> 01:08:39.264]  They're going to get you.
[01:08:41.026 --> 01:08:41.706]  Every other story.
[01:08:42.987 --> 01:08:49.372]  And it says, new twist in Murder of Texas Girl.
[01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:51.294]  Jasmine Marantz.
[01:08:54.456 --> 01:08:56.117]  Now, you talk about trying to under the radar something.
[01:08:56.157 --> 01:08:59.540]  It should have been shooters captured.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:00.280]  Confess.
[01:09:01.271 --> 01:09:02.332]  Because the local news said that.
[01:09:04.454 --> 01:09:09.958]  And I had to read and read, and they wouldn't say the name, and wouldn't say when the arrest happened, because it had happened over a day before.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.483]  And so I typed in her name, and it was all national news.
[01:09:15.543 --> 01:09:16.724]  New York Times, Washington Post.
[01:09:17.244 --> 01:09:20.647]  Oh, new twist, might have been mistaken, nothing about what color the guys are.
[01:09:20.667 --> 01:09:24.430]  Even though there's local news, and the video, and the tweets, and the mugshots.
[01:09:26.869 --> 01:09:28.090]  And I went, oh my goodness.
[01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.771]  Google's obviously blocking local news.
[01:09:30.952 --> 01:09:33.133]  I'm going to go to local TV stations.
[01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:35.174]  I typed in ABC Houston.
[01:09:35.995 --> 01:09:37.216]  Not even remembering it's ABC 13.
[01:09:37.876 --> 01:09:38.256]  Boom!
[01:09:38.316 --> 01:09:38.857]  Front page!
[01:09:39.037 --> 01:09:39.517]  Black guy.
[01:09:39.977 --> 01:09:40.398]  Boom!
[01:09:41.418 --> 01:09:42.679]  Him being led into the jail.
[01:09:42.719 --> 01:09:43.900]  Him being arraigned at the court.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:45.441]  Didn't waste any time.
[01:09:46.541 --> 01:09:47.122]  Confessing.
[01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:48.603]  Saying he had an accomplice.
[01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:53.406]  They thought it was another drug car that had screwed him over.
[01:09:57.796 --> 01:10:08.123]  Now you know the sick feeling that is to know that I spent 20 or 30 minutes looking at the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, and it was all just kind of buried at the bottom.
[01:10:08.303 --> 01:10:09.004]  Oh, New Twist.
[01:10:09.224 --> 01:10:10.144]  It all had the same headline.
[01:10:10.485 --> 01:10:12.746]  Different names on the articles, but it's all the talking points.
[01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:13.827]  What are we going to do?
[01:10:13.907 --> 01:10:15.048]  It's not a white guy.
[01:10:15.308 --> 01:10:17.029]  We'll just say New Twist and hope it goes away.
[01:10:17.449 --> 01:10:17.830]  Uh-uh.
[01:10:18.630 --> 01:10:23.913]  Demonstrations with thousands and thousands and thousands of people out saying white supremacists are killing us.
[01:10:24.154 --> 01:10:25.074]  We're all being murdered.
[01:10:25.094 --> 01:10:26.475]  There's whites killing us everywhere.
[01:10:27.095 --> 01:10:28.916]  And the new Black Panther Party leading it.
[01:10:29.877 --> 01:10:37.382]  And Sean King out there, who, again, looks like Red Butler from Gone with the Wind.
[01:10:37.402 --> 01:10:38.723]  Doesn't look like a black guy to me.
[01:10:39.243 --> 01:10:41.064]  Sean King's out there stoking it all.
[01:10:46.287 --> 01:10:47.068]  It's just crazy!
[01:10:48.308 --> 01:10:51.509]  This guy's whiter than that other white lady that poses like she's black.
[01:10:51.529 --> 01:10:52.169]  What's her name again?
[01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:57.291]  Rachel Dolezal.
[01:10:58.532 --> 01:11:01.373]  So we've got Red Butler over here.
[01:11:05.914 --> 01:11:10.856]  Also known as Clark Gable, the actor, has been risen from the dead and is now down in Houston.
[01:11:12.476 --> 01:11:14.257]  He's probably whiter than Red Butler.
[01:11:16.906 --> 01:11:17.526]  And he's there.
[01:11:17.546 --> 01:11:18.647]  I'm not making a joke out of this.
[01:11:18.687 --> 01:11:19.968]  These people are sick.
[01:11:22.489 --> 01:11:28.172]  It turns out on Wednesday, he got the tip because he's the main leader down there orchestrating all this.
[01:11:28.553 --> 01:11:34.536]  And he doesn't go out and say, oh, I'm getting tips from people that were there that it was two black men in a car.
[01:11:34.996 --> 01:11:37.678]  He said that just sounded too implausible.
[01:11:38.718 --> 01:11:43.141]  So he tells the sheriff and he and the sheriff don't say, oh, we've got new leads.
[01:11:44.619 --> 01:11:46.482]  From witnesses that were there, no.
[01:11:47.183 --> 01:11:52.770]  They go out and keep putting out until Saturday, the day the guys are already busted.
[01:11:55.674 --> 01:11:59.620]  On Saturday, they are still saying...
[01:12:01.155 --> 01:12:10.057]  And the sheriff is still saying we're looking for the white supremacist and they're finding white guys that have been arrested for different things that look a little bit like the sketch saying, is this him?
[01:12:10.317 --> 01:12:10.858]  Is this him?
[01:12:11.238 --> 01:12:13.338]  And it's in Sean King's Twitter.
[01:12:13.358 --> 01:12:14.039]  I was reading this morning.
[01:12:14.299 --> 01:12:16.099]  Here's this racist piece of garbage.
[01:12:16.419 --> 01:12:19.820]  We hear this guy who was just arrested for a DWI.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.001]  We hear he's a racist piece of crap.
[01:12:22.601 --> 01:12:24.001]  Let us know what you know about him.
[01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:26.222]  So they're putting random white guys up on Twitter.
[01:12:29.283 --> 01:12:30.303]  When they've got a lead,
[01:12:31.929 --> 01:12:41.398]  Not even acted upon, and it turns out it was police, separately for a non-turn signal, and driving erratically, that pulled the other guy over, and then he all freaked out and admitted it.
[01:12:42.559 --> 01:12:50.727]  As best we can tell, the sheriff's department was, the sheriff himself, not the police, was not even going to follow up, I guess.
[01:12:51.328 --> 01:12:52.108]  Because why not?
[01:12:52.128 --> 01:12:54.711]  Man, we got a media bonanza here.
[01:12:55.848 --> 01:13:04.512]  We got Sheriff Ed Gonzalez up there, man, talking about white supremacy and everything, and getting those votes, boy, down in Blue Cesspool, Houston.
[01:13:04.872 --> 01:13:06.512]  We got it going on, man.
[01:13:06.793 --> 01:13:11.034]  You got a mayor down there that wants to teach five-year-old boys to wear dresses and all.
[01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:12.975]  I mean, you got a cesspool down there.
[01:13:15.396 --> 01:13:18.337]  And then in comes this guy.
[01:13:18.357 --> 01:13:21.679]  And then they get the other guy.
[01:13:22.657 --> 01:13:23.598]  And they say, no, we did it.
[01:13:23.638 --> 01:13:24.658]  We thought it was another drug car.
[01:13:24.698 --> 01:13:25.619]  We filled it full of holes.
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:28.181]  And the story just disappears.
[01:13:29.942 --> 01:13:30.963]  But see, the story is...
[01:13:32.452 --> 01:13:38.356]  They knew damn well what was going on, in my view, the sheriff did at least, but they didn't follow up on that, because it didn't fit the narrative.
[01:13:38.577 --> 01:13:41.979]  Why, they could have kept that media bonanza nationally going months.
[01:13:41.999 --> 01:13:45.201]  It could be the new Trayvon Martin, who killed Jasmine Barnes!
[01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:46.402]  He could be stars!
[01:13:46.442 --> 01:13:48.564]  Why, he could be the head of the Justice Department someday!
[01:13:48.964 --> 01:13:57.751]  Why, they could turn the whole state blue on this, shayin' murderin' redneck Texans, out there killin' little black girls, all for absolutely nothin'!
[01:13:59.921 --> 01:14:03.745]  Even though, statistically, blacks are 10 times more likely to kill whites.
[01:14:04.165 --> 01:14:05.726]  That's just an FBI statistic, you can pull it up.
[01:14:06.347 --> 01:14:11.051]  And I don't dislike black folks, but the fact is the media sold the idea that killing whitey's a good thing to do.
[01:14:11.091 --> 01:14:12.473]  Hell, killing cops is a good thing to do.
[01:14:13.814 --> 01:14:16.837]  And if you're black, you're 10 times more likely to be killed by a black person.
[01:14:17.637 --> 01:14:20.520]  Oh, but the sheriff and Mr. Red Adair
[01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:33.356]  They said it was too improbable, it was just unbelievable that it could be two black guys at 6.30 in the morning in a mainly black area shooting up a car!
[01:14:33.437 --> 01:14:34.757]  Oh, that never happened before!
[01:14:35.378 --> 01:14:35.758]  No!
[01:14:36.919 --> 01:14:38.059]  We found the unicorn!
[01:14:40.361 --> 01:14:43.763]  White devil senselessly killing a little black girl.
[01:14:44.123 --> 01:14:45.964]  We've got what we need because, you know, it does happen.
[01:14:46.585 --> 01:14:49.446]  You get some scumbag lunatic, goes in a black church, kills nine people.
[01:14:49.667 --> 01:14:50.567]  It's the end of the world.
[01:14:50.667 --> 01:14:51.748]  All whites are guilty for it.
[01:14:53.584 --> 01:14:55.865]  Some lunatic walked in a grocery store, shot some black folks.
[01:14:55.885 --> 01:14:57.406]  We don't know exactly why, but it's wrong.
[01:14:57.667 --> 01:15:03.490]  There are some bad racist white people, but it's pretty rare in 2019 to have that going on.
[01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:05.832]  But you see, what a good way to start the new year.
[01:15:06.392 --> 01:15:18.380]  Right before the new year starts, you get to roll all this out, and now they just want to delete all their articles, and they're deleting all the old articles calling it white supremacy and America braces for white killers and vigilantes.
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:21.200]  When we come back, I'm going to play a clip of it.
[01:15:21.481 --> 01:15:37.486]  The Young Turds deleted this video, but we got it, and it's posted in an article by Paul Joseph Watson, and they're hoping, hoping, hoping you don't go to Infowars.com or Newswars.com and tweet this or Facebook it because they just want to keep the lie going.
[01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:40.007]  Young Turds founder,
[01:15:42.259 --> 01:15:50.667]  Of the group named after the Armenian genocide group, young Turks delete multiple videos after claiming black shooter was white supremacist motivated by Trump.
[01:15:51.028 --> 01:15:54.471]  Well guess what you big old stinking turd?
[01:15:55.572 --> 01:16:00.237]  You thought you flushed the truth but we put a snake down on it and we plumbed that turd back up.
[01:16:02.076 --> 01:16:06.018]  In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[01:16:06.999 --> 01:16:12.902]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[01:16:13.383 --> 01:16:22.828]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[01:16:23.308 --> 01:16:24.489]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[01:16:25.069 --> 01:16:27.351]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[01:16:27.931 --> 01:16:40.394]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes.
[01:16:40.474 --> 01:16:44.195]  Everybody knows about it on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[01:16:44.215 --> 01:16:53.197]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[01:16:54.051 --> 01:17:13.937]  But now they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[01:17:14.717 --> 01:17:16.938]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation
[01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:22.372]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom, they're patriots.
[01:17:22.732 --> 01:17:42.722]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you, you drop ship it, you get it out, you have the website, I promote it, I send people there, and that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[01:17:43.402 --> 01:17:46.844]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[01:17:47.961 --> 01:17:57.605]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[01:17:58.365 --> 01:18:03.107]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[01:18:03.387 --> 01:18:11.471]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[01:18:12.694 --> 01:18:22.804]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp, so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado, where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[01:18:23.084 --> 01:18:24.926]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:25.547]  I've researched it.
[01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:31.032]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us in the last six years.
[01:18:31.132 --> 01:18:32.473]  It's gotten really crazy in the last two.
[01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:45.199]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:54.364]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[01:18:55.024 --> 01:19:11.252]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all because they have more than 40 products.
[01:19:11.612 --> 01:19:14.373]  Now remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[01:19:14.573 --> 01:19:15.574]  They've tried to shut us down.
[01:19:16.374 --> 01:19:17.575]  They've tried to boycott us.
[01:19:17.595 --> 01:19:18.395]  They've tried to sue us.
[01:19:18.895 --> 01:19:25.378]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move, not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[01:19:25.618 --> 01:19:33.362]  We're still going to do that at themforwarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[01:19:33.462 --> 01:19:35.283]  And this is the first big one.
[01:19:35.663 --> 01:19:36.523]  So I'm very excited.
[01:19:36.543 --> 01:19:37.324]  Be sure and go there.
[01:19:37.384 --> 01:19:44.047]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[01:19:44.087 --> 01:19:46.529]  Well, highest quality, the lowest prices.
[01:19:46.989 --> 01:19:52.773]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at washingtonsreserve.com, and you're helping fund the info war the whole time.
[01:20:05.482 --> 01:20:08.144]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:32.873 --> 01:20:34.294]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:34.554 --> 01:20:35.715]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:36.215 --> 01:20:40.959]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:47.143 --> 01:20:51.185]  So, we got the sheriff given a tip by eyewitnesses.
[01:20:51.205 --> 01:20:59.111]  Oh, and of course the tip came from one of the good little national leftists, Sean King.
[01:21:00.908 --> 01:21:07.831]  He got a tip, he gave it to the Sheriff's Department, but they thought it was just too improbable that two black men would shoot black people in a black neighborhood.
[01:21:07.871 --> 01:21:09.411]  That's never happened before, not once.
[01:21:09.791 --> 01:21:15.393]  Even though, again, you're 10-to-1 more likely to be shot by a black person if you're black than by anybody else.
[01:21:15.994 --> 01:21:17.494]  And the numbers in some cases are even higher.
[01:21:17.514 --> 01:21:23.596]  20-to-1, 30-to-1, depending on areas like Chicago, where 95% of the people killed are black!
[01:21:23.977 --> 01:21:25.677]  And 90-plus percent doing it are black!
[01:21:26.037 --> 01:21:27.198]  I'm sad that's happening!
[01:21:28.898 --> 01:21:30.559]  But if you understand this, you understand everything.
[01:21:32.481 --> 01:21:41.384]  Why does the Southern Poverty Law Center, why does the ADL, why do the universities all obsess and Google on burying crime statistics?
[01:21:41.404 --> 01:21:42.784]  It's one of their main missions.
[01:21:42.824 --> 01:21:58.389]  It comes out in the news to hide black-on-white crime because it doesn't fit the narrative of whites are all guilty and whites are all the devil, so vote socialist and be a democrat and we'll wave a magic wand over you and say you're not racist.
[01:21:59.437 --> 01:22:13.831]  And it keeps blacks in the literal plantations of the neighborhoods where the Democrats ship the drugs in and run the society and pass the laws to give them longer prison sentences than whites that Trump just repealed with no credit.
[01:22:14.632 --> 01:22:18.115]  Because Trump understands we have to unify the nation and stop this setup.
[01:22:20.257 --> 01:22:23.941]  He's trying as hard as he can.
[01:22:25.745 --> 01:22:26.826]  To expose this.
[01:22:27.687 --> 01:22:30.210]  Oh, the Southern Property Law Center says they fact-checked it.
[01:22:30.230 --> 01:22:32.273]  There's not more black on white crime.
[01:22:32.313 --> 01:22:32.974]  That's just not true.
[01:22:33.594 --> 01:22:37.058]  Well, just like AP said, there is no migrant caravan.
[01:22:37.098 --> 01:22:37.919]  We fact-checked it.
[01:22:42.204 --> 01:22:45.588]  It's incredible, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:46.374 --> 01:22:50.438]  Now the unified crime statistics from the FBI show it's as high as 97%.
[01:22:51.559 --> 01:22:54.282]  And in some cities it's as high as 97%.
[01:22:55.243 --> 01:22:59.708]  Chicago last time I saw was 94%, but they fight hard to cover that up.
[01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:09.438]  And you see, you know when the shooter of a white person is a minority, because you always don't have a description.
[01:23:10.973 --> 01:23:16.357]  Or in Europe it'll be, oh, hundreds of German men raped women in Berlin and in Cologne.
[01:23:16.597 --> 01:23:18.158]  And then you see the videos, it's a bunch of Muslims.
[01:23:19.419 --> 01:23:20.599]  Germans raped women.
[01:23:20.659 --> 01:23:22.380]  No, Muslim invaders did.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.723]  They still have slave trade in the Middle East in many countries.
[01:23:26.103 --> 01:23:26.623]  And in Africa.
[01:23:27.264 --> 01:23:27.624]  Not here.
[01:23:28.064 --> 01:23:29.145]  The West ended it.
[01:23:29.785 --> 01:23:31.086]  Christianity ended it.
[01:23:31.346 --> 01:23:33.488]  Fought hundreds of years of wars to try to end it.
[01:23:34.248 --> 01:23:35.329]  Finally with a civil war here.
[01:23:38.533 --> 01:23:39.834]  But oh, it's only white people!
[01:23:39.854 --> 01:23:41.415]  It's this whole cosmology.
[01:23:41.635 --> 01:23:43.156]  This is the new religion of the left.
[01:23:43.997 --> 01:23:44.977]  This is their whole system.
[01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:54.924]  And so, they need to keep this going, and so every time a white person gets killed and racially motivated, it gets covered up.
[01:23:56.145 --> 01:23:57.626]  Or if it's just a robbery, it gets covered up.
[01:23:57.666 --> 01:23:59.087]  You never hear the description.
[01:24:00.047 --> 01:24:01.708]  And then it's very quiet if they ever bust them.
[01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:05.271]  But boy, if you got a white doing something,
[01:24:06.769 --> 01:24:10.511]  We're going to push that, because that fits the narrative, to make everybody fight with each other.
[01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:12.771]  And it's not to advance black people this is being done.
[01:24:13.092 --> 01:24:15.653]  This is meant to make white people scared and racist.
[01:24:16.093 --> 01:24:18.634]  It's to make black people scared and racist, just like a prison.
[01:24:18.994 --> 01:24:22.255]  And we're all divided, and the globalists are the jail guards and the warren.
[01:24:23.516 --> 01:24:23.916]  The warden.
[01:24:24.776 --> 01:24:27.437]  This is divide and conquer, stratagem, the great game, period.
[01:24:27.657 --> 01:24:28.878]  So here's Sink Uyghur.
[01:24:30.111 --> 01:24:31.052]  Lord of the turds.
[01:24:31.872 --> 01:24:32.492]  Young turds.
[01:24:32.873 --> 01:24:36.535]  Named after a genocidal anti-Christian group that killed a million and a half people.
[01:24:37.515 --> 01:24:38.696]  He denies the Armenian genocide happened.
[01:24:38.716 --> 01:24:39.517]  It was totally public.
[01:24:40.477 --> 01:24:41.638]  Well, there's not Christians in Turkey.
[01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:48.602]  Here he is just a few days ago, but now they've deleted all these videos.
[01:24:48.622 --> 01:24:48.982]  Here it is.
[01:24:50.683 --> 01:24:51.724]  So this is terrorism.
[01:24:52.924 --> 01:24:57.467]  And we don't know why he did it, but it's not related to anything else.
[01:24:57.847 --> 01:24:58.087]  Hit pause.
[01:24:58.107 --> 01:24:58.908]  I'm going to start this over.
[01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:01.290]  This is terrorism.
[01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:01.991]  He did it.
[01:25:02.851 --> 01:25:04.311]  There's a sketch of a white guy.
[01:25:05.512 --> 01:25:06.072]  It's over.
[01:25:06.732 --> 01:25:07.192]  He did it.
[01:25:07.892 --> 01:25:10.813]  You know, he has this Sean King on all the time.
[01:25:11.214 --> 01:25:14.094]  Maybe Mr. King could have told you about the other thing people saw.
[01:25:14.294 --> 01:25:16.595]  Oh, but we don't need to talk about that.
[01:25:16.635 --> 01:25:17.856]  Let's go back to the Lord of the Turds.
[01:25:19.396 --> 01:25:20.416]  So this is terrorism.
[01:25:21.597 --> 01:25:23.617]  And we don't know why he did it.
[01:25:24.358 --> 01:25:26.158]  But it's not related to anything else.
[01:25:26.598 --> 01:25:28.019]  It's not involved in anything.
[01:25:28.919 --> 01:25:34.843]  It bothers me that I have to think about it, and she has to think about it, and we all have to think about it.
[01:25:34.863 --> 01:25:35.804]  Did she do something wrong?
[01:25:36.244 --> 01:25:37.145]  She didn't, right?
[01:25:37.625 --> 01:25:42.948]  Obviously, it's relevant, because if there was an earlier dispute, that would explain why it happened, right?
[01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:44.409]  But there is no earlier dispute.
[01:25:44.449 --> 01:25:45.650]  There was no dispute on the highway.
[01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:46.791]  There was no dispute before that.
[01:25:46.831 --> 01:25:47.751]  They don't know each other.
[01:25:50.633 --> 01:25:52.054]  We don't know what's in the guy's head.
[01:25:52.775 --> 01:25:55.137]  He was wearing a red sweatshirt, not a red hat.
[01:25:55.557 --> 01:25:55.917]  Okay?
[01:25:56.978 --> 01:26:03.103]  But he fires into this random car with kids in it.
[01:26:03.363 --> 01:26:03.923]  With kids in it.
[01:26:04.044 --> 01:26:04.564]  And he kills them.
[01:26:05.184 --> 01:26:07.026]  So was he politically motivated?
[01:26:07.066 --> 01:26:08.567]  Was he religiously motivated?
[01:26:08.747 --> 01:26:10.789]  Was he ethnically motivated?
[01:26:11.409 --> 01:26:12.090]  We have no idea.
[01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:14.251]  Or... Hey, everybody's got a gun.
[01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:16.472]  Oh, God, it's so much fun to shoot them.
[01:26:16.973 --> 01:26:20.235]  Okay, and then... Oh, well, like, a seven-year-old died.
[01:26:20.295 --> 01:26:20.695]  Whatever.
[01:26:20.715 --> 01:26:21.996]  I had fun shooting my gun.
[01:26:22.016 --> 01:26:23.817]  Or was he just mentally unbalanced?
[01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:25.838]  I don't know, because everybody in the country's got a gun, so...
[01:26:27.779 --> 01:26:29.340]  Uh, this is what happens when everybody has a gun.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.461]  Hit pause.
[01:26:30.481 --> 01:26:38.585]  That's right, you only want to have the Turkish government finishing up, you know, the conquest of Istanbul when it was Constantinople.
[01:26:38.805 --> 01:26:42.487]  You know, a thousand years later or whatever, you gotta go ahead and mop up the last Christians, right?
[01:26:42.747 --> 01:26:44.368]  So only you have the guns and we don't have them.
[01:26:44.548 --> 01:26:45.629]  We get it, old turdly.
[01:26:46.209 --> 01:26:47.070]  We get it, old turdly.
[01:26:47.110 --> 01:26:47.530]  Here he is.
[01:26:48.090 --> 01:26:50.672]  Look, you know what we're all thinking.
[01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:51.852]  Why did he do it?
[01:26:53.963 --> 01:26:59.469]  And only one possible reason pops up, but it could be something else.
[01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:02.953]  But right now, the only thing that separates him and her is the race.
[01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:05.055]  And so, but maybe it's not that.
[01:27:05.316 --> 01:27:07.778]  Maybe it's something else, but whatever it is... Hit pause again.
[01:27:08.199 --> 01:27:10.962]  It's... He just said this guy is guilty.
[01:27:12.463 --> 01:27:13.384]  This guy's guilty.
[01:27:14.405 --> 01:27:14.766]  Continue.
[01:27:16.684 --> 01:27:18.587]  It's what I referred to earlier.
[01:27:20.350 --> 01:27:25.638]  Of all people, Chelsea Manning taught me this phrase recently, stochastic terrorism.
[01:27:26.719 --> 01:27:27.280]  It's when
[01:27:28.919 --> 01:27:32.260]  People are encouraged by leaders to do violent acts.
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:34.921]  The leader doesn't say kill this specific person.
[01:27:35.441 --> 01:27:37.382]  Doesn't say you should target Jasmine Barnes.
[01:27:37.602 --> 01:27:38.282]  Pause again.
[01:27:38.583 --> 01:27:44.845]  You have Antifa breaking people's ribs, shooting people, attacking, going to their houses, saying kill them, and Democrats are saying do that.
[01:27:45.365 --> 01:27:50.227]  Then you're trying to blame Trump and conservatives for this little girl killed by two black guys.
[01:27:51.087 --> 01:27:51.768]  Just incredible.
[01:27:51.988 --> 01:27:52.368]  Continue.
[01:27:52.508 --> 01:27:54.030]  Notice he didn't retract this and apologize.
[01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:55.571]  They deleted this video.
[01:27:55.811 --> 01:27:57.993]  They're trying to send cease and desist orders to take it down.
[01:27:58.193 --> 01:28:00.035]  It's fair use, you big ugly pig!
[01:28:00.335 --> 01:28:01.176]  You monster!
[01:28:01.896 --> 01:28:05.119]  We'll shove this down your dirty throat, you un-American filth!
[01:28:05.439 --> 01:28:06.100]  Play more of it!
[01:28:06.994 --> 01:28:09.535]  It just encourages you to hate a certain group of people.
[01:28:10.055 --> 01:28:16.018]  And then random unbalanced people in the country pop up and do the violence on their behalf.
[01:28:16.058 --> 01:28:16.398]  Pause again.
[01:28:17.098 --> 01:28:21.720]  He knows all about this because the Young Turks was the group of militia that killed a million and a half Christians.
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:23.661]  That was told and hyped up to do it.
[01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:27.042]  He's an expert on the type of terrorism he just told you about.
[01:28:27.322 --> 01:28:28.243]  What a pig!
[01:28:29.423 --> 01:28:30.423]  What a dirtbag!
[01:28:30.543 --> 01:28:31.464]  My lord!
[01:28:32.144 --> 01:28:33.104]  And it just gets worse from here.
[01:28:33.124 --> 01:28:34.145]  We'll finish up when we come back.
[01:28:35.779 --> 01:28:40.862]  But this is disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting, disgusting.
[01:28:41.562 --> 01:28:49.266]  It's really unspeakable how he's just dripping with enjoyment covering all these lies and spewing this garbage.
[01:28:49.406 --> 01:28:53.048]  I mean, what a lying sack of garbage.
[01:28:54.309 --> 01:28:55.229]  What a piece of filth.
[01:28:55.469 --> 01:28:57.190]  Why don't you go back to Turkey, okay?
[01:28:57.570 --> 01:28:59.031]  We don't want young Turks here.
[01:29:01.913 --> 01:29:03.193]  Tucker Carlson
[01:29:05.233 --> 01:29:15.882]  The number two talk show host in the country on television, and who is a patriot and a very smart guy, is being Alex Jones right now in front of all of us.
[01:29:16.502 --> 01:29:27.311]  They're building a straw man, demonizing him, lying about him, taking things out of context, so they can then take him off the air and then really start to run him into the ground.
[01:29:28.404 --> 01:29:35.853]  In fact, it came out just a few months ago that in the internal Google documents, where they said ban Alex Jones, they also said ban Tucker Carlson.
[01:29:36.513 --> 01:29:37.815]  He was right under me on the list.
[01:29:38.676 --> 01:29:44.182]  And I could already see, once they deplatformed me, that they began to focus in on Tucker Carlson.
[01:29:44.202 --> 01:29:44.523]  That's why.
[01:29:45.836 --> 01:29:47.296]  Talking to him off air, I've warned him.
[01:29:47.937 --> 01:29:50.157]  I told him four months ago, I said, you are next.
[01:29:50.757 --> 01:29:53.738]  He was already, obviously, covering all that on air.
[01:29:54.619 --> 01:29:58.080]  And it's because he's got such credibility that the establishment is attacking him.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:02.441]  But let's look at what they're attacking him for.
[01:30:03.956 --> 01:30:11.320]  He said that they create this national guilt that America is this evil, racist place, when we've been the most open nation to immigrants the world's ever seen.
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:18.743]  And the days of Ellis Island, you would be held for three to six months, everybody, to make sure you didn't have any serious diseases.
[01:30:19.524 --> 01:30:25.207]  But today, we have George Soros and the UN and others that openly fund huge caravans coming into Europe and the U.S.
[01:30:26.175 --> 01:30:41.268]  Where people show up with cholera, and leprosy, and drug-resistant TB, and hundreds of other horrible infectious diseases, and we're told, don't even screen them, let them into the country, and then, under Obama, let them be child-trafficked.
[01:30:42.589 --> 01:30:44.171]  Senate report confirmed all of that.
[01:30:44.931 --> 01:30:49.815]  Gave the children to child traffickers, because you can't even see who the kids are with, sometimes unaccompanied.
[01:30:49.835 --> 01:30:53.579]  You've just got to let them in and put them on Democrat Party-controlled buses.
[01:30:54.921 --> 01:31:01.504]  If we go back to 10 years ago, seems like ancient history now, Lou Dobbs had about 8-9 million viewers a night.
[01:31:02.044 --> 01:31:04.045]  That's double what Sean Hannity has, he's number one.
[01:31:04.406 --> 01:31:05.706]  Carlson's number two with 4 million.
[01:31:06.667 --> 01:31:07.527]  And what was he talking about?
[01:31:07.687 --> 01:31:12.069]  Globalism, open borders, the UN using migrants to invade countries.
[01:31:12.089 --> 01:31:13.230]  He was going off their own documents.
[01:31:14.394 --> 01:31:15.716]  People debate all the time about mass immigration.
[01:31:30.453 --> 01:31:36.416]  What you never hear anybody do is make the economic case for mass immigration.
[01:31:36.956 --> 01:31:40.879]  It's obvious that we need more scientists and skilled engineers, but that's not what we're getting.
[01:31:40.919 --> 01:31:44.881]  Instead, we're getting waves of people with high school educations or less.
[01:31:45.301 --> 01:31:47.762]  It's indefensible, so nobody even tries to defend it.
[01:31:48.362 --> 01:31:51.704]  Instead, our leaders demand that you shut up and accept this.
[01:31:51.864 --> 01:31:58.628]  We have a moral obligation to admit the world's poor, they tell us, even if it makes our own country poorer and dirtier and more divided.
[01:31:59.249 --> 01:32:05.433]  So if you import the third world, you are making it more poor, more dirty, more divided.
[01:32:05.933 --> 01:32:11.717]  Just like Democrat-controlled cities have feces everywhere, and needles, and the highest crime in every case.
[01:32:11.777 --> 01:32:13.538]  Same thing with socialist countries overseas.
[01:32:13.818 --> 01:32:17.501]  Because it's a system of dependency that they create.
[01:32:18.775 --> 01:32:22.416]  So if Tucker Carlson's guilty of anything, it's for not going far enough.
[01:32:22.836 --> 01:32:32.399]  It doesn't just make our cities dirtier and poorer and more divided, it makes them more dangerous, where San Francisco jury's letting a legal alien that shoots a woman in the back go, because, well, she's white.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:33.760]  We have diversity signal.
[01:32:34.485 --> 01:32:35.525]  This is the real cancer.
[01:32:36.326 --> 01:32:45.368]  The left openly now has drag events for four-year-olds, gay bars, have little children dancing and having money thrown at them.
[01:32:45.728 --> 01:32:51.070]  I mean, is there nothing we won't put up with, with the bullying of the left and their total cultural takeover?
[01:32:51.870 --> 01:32:54.391]  If we don't start standing up for each other, we're going to lose everything.
[01:32:54.871 --> 01:32:56.851]  Yesterday it was Alex Jones, now it's Tucker Carlson.
[01:32:56.871 --> 01:32:59.032]  You just say no to these bullies, now more than ever.
[01:33:06.525 --> 01:33:09.109]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.053 --> 01:33:28.436]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:30.998]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.638 --> 01:33:38.103]  Well, there's so much insane breaking news that my head's spinning, but we're going to hit it all here in just a few minutes, and I'm going to open the phones up in the next hour and take your calls.
[01:33:38.824 --> 01:33:41.285]  Israel's Netanyahu to make a dramatic announcement.
[01:33:41.325 --> 01:33:42.686]  They think he may be resigning.
[01:33:45.388 --> 01:33:48.571]  Outrage after French author says successful men are attracted to younger women.
[01:33:49.091 --> 01:33:50.712]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:33:52.130 --> 01:33:54.992]  The left's silence on an illegal immigrant who killed officer is deafening.
[01:33:55.012 --> 01:33:57.174]  We're going to play Will Johnson's report coming up.
[01:33:57.214 --> 01:33:58.215]  That's up on Infowars.com.
[01:33:58.255 --> 01:33:59.476]  You need to get that out.
[01:33:59.616 --> 01:34:01.218]  Remember, nobody else will if you don't do it.
[01:34:01.598 --> 01:34:03.159]  Globalist World Bank head resigns.
[01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.622]  Trump to nominate new president.
[01:34:06.762 --> 01:34:08.083]  That scares the hell out of the globalists.
[01:34:09.244 --> 01:34:10.926]  We've got so much we're going to be getting to.
[01:34:10.966 --> 01:34:14.088]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg is pretty much on her deathbed.
[01:34:14.228 --> 01:34:15.489]  All evidence points towards that.
[01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:19.413]  She first had everybody show up for a vote after cancer surgery two weeks ago.
[01:34:21.425 --> 01:34:23.167]  And of course, the big news I haven't hit yet.
[01:34:23.347 --> 01:34:25.109]  I'll hit the start of the next hour before your calls.
[01:34:25.529 --> 01:34:30.634]  Hacker Group releases 9-11 papers, says future leaks will burn down U.S.
[01:34:30.694 --> 01:34:31.215]  Deep State.
[01:34:32.596 --> 01:34:34.718]  And they're having a government shutdown over in the U.K.
[01:34:35.118 --> 01:34:36.300]  over not getting out of Brexit.
[01:34:37.213 --> 01:34:41.757]  And the Yellow Vests have had other giant demonstrations all over Europe against the NWO.
[01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:43.858]  So we're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:34:43.878 --> 01:34:44.859]  I'm going to get more of that.
[01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:47.661]  And Trump to travel to southern border.
[01:34:48.061 --> 01:34:50.663]  Thursday, a shutdown standoff intensifies.
[01:34:51.064 --> 01:34:53.285]  We'll be covering that right here live from Texas.
[01:34:55.487 --> 01:34:57.228]  But let's get back to what I was just playing.
[01:34:57.248 --> 01:34:59.310]  And I got so upset and so angry watching it.
[01:35:01.499 --> 01:35:09.603]  The first time, and the second time I got even angrier, because Cenk Uygur of the Young Turks knows exactly what he's doing.
[01:35:12.744 --> 01:35:21.068]  And he's up there when the left has their vigilante brown shirt mobs of the Young Turks, literally.
[01:35:22.428 --> 01:35:25.950]  Is the model for even Hitler's genocide was the Young Turks, that Hitler even said that?
[01:35:27.771 --> 01:35:29.872]  And then you've got him named after a genocidal group.
[01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:34.372]  That he's exactly talking about claiming whites are running genocide against blacks, which isn't happening.
[01:35:34.632 --> 01:35:37.034]  He's talking about abortion in general, and that's from The Globalist.
[01:35:38.476 --> 01:35:42.620]  And then he's up there saying, it's a white guy, we know he's a white guy.
[01:35:43.081 --> 01:35:45.143]  And then it turns out that the guest he had on...
[01:35:47.142 --> 01:36:01.636]  Knew that there was a credible report from eyewitnesses of black men in a truck and to Sean King's credit he at least passed it on to the sheriff but didn't go out and say I've talked to witnesses and they say it was black guys.
[01:36:01.676 --> 01:36:06.141]  He said it was too improbable because we all know blacks have never hurt any other black people.
[01:36:06.909 --> 01:36:07.690]  Just never happened.
[01:36:07.710 --> 01:36:09.011]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:36:09.071 --> 01:36:10.412]  Like, there is no caravan.
[01:36:10.632 --> 01:36:11.633]  There was no caravan.
[01:36:11.693 --> 01:36:13.014]  It never reached San Diego.
[01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:14.796]  It never reached Tijuana.
[01:36:15.536 --> 01:36:16.157]  Trump's lying.
[01:36:16.257 --> 01:36:16.757]  I'm lying.
[01:36:16.857 --> 01:36:18.058]  Associated Press reports.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:21.642]  A fact check at the AP.
[01:36:21.782 --> 01:36:22.522]  Magic wand.
[01:36:22.542 --> 01:36:23.303]  Rubber.
[01:36:23.343 --> 01:36:24.364]  The sky is not blue.
[01:36:24.604 --> 01:36:25.625]  There is no caravan.
[01:36:26.265 --> 01:36:27.647]  White man killed the girl.
[01:36:29.028 --> 01:36:31.270]  So, here is the dramatic, disgusting
[01:36:32.557 --> 01:36:34.598]  Conclusion of the toxic young turd.
[01:36:34.618 --> 01:36:35.018]  Here it is.
[01:36:35.618 --> 01:36:42.500]  People and then random unbalanced people in the country pop up and do the violence on their behalf.
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.781]  And that's called stochastic terrorism.
[01:36:45.421 --> 01:36:46.661]  And that's what this one looks like.
[01:36:47.581 --> 01:36:48.582]  But they're going to investigate.
[01:36:48.622 --> 01:36:49.862]  I hope to God they find the guy.
[01:36:49.882 --> 01:37:00.105]  Sean King does wonderful work in this area and has offered a $35,000 reward for whoever can name the individual and then the police would apprehend him, obviously.
[01:37:00.305 --> 01:37:01.266]  It's actually up to $50,000 now.
[01:37:01.346 --> 01:37:02.527]  I think it's up to $50,000.
[01:37:02.687 --> 01:37:03.368]  Yeah.
[01:37:04.549 --> 01:37:06.070]  You know, her mom was shot.
[01:37:06.791 --> 01:37:10.394]  One of her sisters was injured by glass, but also like... Terrell, this is too powerful.
[01:37:10.434 --> 01:37:11.354]  I just thought of something else.
[01:37:11.394 --> 01:37:12.035]  Back it up, please.
[01:37:12.115 --> 01:37:12.575]  Oh my God.
[01:37:13.336 --> 01:37:16.359]  I was busy this morning when I watched it, so I didn't watch it with full consciousness.
[01:37:19.701 --> 01:37:26.787]  SinkUgur and his guests are saying hashtag Jasmine Barnes with a $30,000 reward.
[01:37:26.827 --> 01:37:27.648]  By the time they were done, it was $100,000.
[01:37:29.144 --> 01:37:33.645]  We had all these big people giving hundreds of thousands of dollars like Shaquille O'Neal, all this stuff, which is great.
[01:37:33.665 --> 01:37:35.066]  It's for the little girl's family.
[01:37:36.926 --> 01:37:47.830]  But he has on Sean King, who knew a couple days into this that there were witnesses that said it was black guys.
[01:37:48.690 --> 01:37:54.932]  Why didn't he just get the reward money and give it to Jasmine's family?
[01:37:56.652 --> 01:37:57.973]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:37:58.649 --> 01:38:07.154]  Got these big rewards up there and he has Sean King on, aka Clark Gable, whitest black dude I ever saw.
[01:38:07.174 --> 01:38:08.495]  Here it is.
[01:38:10.156 --> 01:38:13.078]  You know, her mom was shot.
[01:38:13.778 --> 01:38:15.980]  One of her sisters was injured by glass, but also like
[01:38:17.048 --> 01:38:18.129]  These are babies.
[01:38:18.169 --> 01:38:20.170]  Like, we're talking about, I think, a teenager in the front seats.
[01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:21.911]  One of the kids was six in the back.
[01:38:21.951 --> 01:38:25.213]  And I don't recall how old the other little girl was.
[01:38:25.253 --> 01:38:29.856]  But these children saw their sister's dead body.
[01:38:29.876 --> 01:38:29.976]  Yeah.
[01:38:30.577 --> 01:38:31.618]  They saw their sister.
[01:38:31.678 --> 01:38:32.618]  Like, you know what I mean?
[01:38:32.658 --> 01:38:37.942]  That part, like, hasn't even, you know, like, we're talking about the physical damage before the rest of their life they have.
[01:38:38.502 --> 01:38:40.383]  Yeah, only a white monster could do this.
[01:38:40.763 --> 01:38:41.784]  Africans don't kill each other.
[01:38:41.844 --> 01:38:42.784]  Blacks don't kill each other.
[01:38:43.345 --> 01:38:45.966]  Only, she's just, only a white monster!
[01:38:46.046 --> 01:38:47.187]  It's horrible!
[01:38:48.387 --> 01:38:50.508]  What are we gonna do about the white people?
[01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:57.732]  This is the same woman that just calls me all these names and calls me to be taken off the air.
[01:38:58.012 --> 01:39:00.394]  This is a monstrous group of authoritarian dirtbags.
[01:39:00.414 --> 01:39:04.516]  Can you imagine if Schick, the turd, and this lady ran the country?
[01:39:04.916 --> 01:39:06.377]  Man, we'd be worse than Venezuela.
[01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:08.411]  Let's go back to these folks.
[01:39:09.672 --> 01:39:16.196]  ...before the rest of their life, they have the image of a bullet hole in their sister's head.
[01:39:17.016 --> 01:39:18.077]  It's horrible.
[01:39:18.837 --> 01:39:34.327]  And, um, we should, and I'm glad we are, like, talking about, like, you know, even, like, keeping it in the forefront of our minds, like, that this could be racially motivated, that, you know, no one knows why this happened, not even that there's any possible logical reason, but, you know, people still are curious of a motive, but also,
[01:39:35.248 --> 01:39:38.211]  The gun laws in Texas are garbage.
[01:39:38.391 --> 01:39:47.100]  I've lived in Texas for a while and there are parts of the state... I bet you money that those guys had those guns illegally and had stolen them or something.
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:48.301]  But it doesn't matter!
[01:39:49.895 --> 01:39:51.475]  We have guns to protect ourselves.
[01:39:51.515 --> 01:39:55.416]  The highest crime rate in the country is Chicago, sweetheart, where they've taken all the guns.
[01:39:56.137 --> 01:39:57.717]  And there's more guns you can shake a stick at.
[01:39:58.377 --> 01:40:01.578]  So, but she's not even as bad as Lord of the Turds, though.
[01:40:02.018 --> 01:40:02.418]  Sinky.
[01:40:03.358 --> 01:40:06.799]  Because he just said, this is terrorism, this is a white terrorist, period.
[01:40:07.119 --> 01:40:10.060]  He was probably, you know, make America great again, guy.
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:10.360]  Here it is.
[01:40:11.365 --> 01:40:12.606]  Culturally, that I just love.
[01:40:12.626 --> 01:40:13.786]  They're just unbeatable.
[01:40:14.127 --> 01:40:16.548]  But the gun laws in Texas are garbage.
[01:40:17.229 --> 01:40:20.751]  And the gun culture in Texas is absolute trash.
[01:40:20.771 --> 01:40:22.432]  Like people pushing for more guns on campus.
[01:40:22.752 --> 01:40:26.694]  People wanting, you know, open carry laws everywhere.
[01:40:26.914 --> 01:40:27.895]  It's not okay.
[01:40:28.515 --> 01:40:32.298]  And this is, you know, this is what comes from that.
[01:40:33.298 --> 01:40:33.719]  Oh really?
[01:40:34.479 --> 01:40:36.400]  Not gangbangers out there shooting up a vehicle?
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:39.142]  Who are all messed up at 6.30 in the morning?
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:42.161]  But let's think about what she's really saying.
[01:40:42.601 --> 01:40:48.343]  If you study the Carpetbagger publication, Texas Monthly, and others, the left wants Texas blue.
[01:40:48.663 --> 01:40:51.884]  So they don't call us idiots and hayseeds and racist morons out of hand.
[01:40:51.904 --> 01:40:53.525]  They're like, oh, you're wonderful people.
[01:40:53.565 --> 01:40:54.405]  We really like you.
[01:40:54.645 --> 01:40:57.026]  We've ruined all our states, New York, California.
[01:40:57.586 --> 01:40:59.547]  We're going to come in there and take over your life now.
[01:41:00.427 --> 01:41:01.988]  But you've got some garbage laws.
[01:41:02.028 --> 01:41:06.849]  So let us come down there and let us Armenian genocide you, basically.
[01:41:09.488 --> 01:41:11.350]  Hey, we took over Constantinople.
[01:41:13.733 --> 01:41:16.136]  Just give us the weapons and we're gonna take care of you.
[01:41:16.456 --> 01:41:17.758]  No, we're not turning ours in.
[01:41:18.058 --> 01:41:19.259]  Just give us the weapons!
[01:41:20.421 --> 01:41:21.081]  Let us in!
[01:41:21.101 --> 01:41:24.005]  And we'll show you how we're superior.
[01:41:24.045 --> 01:41:25.767]  We'll take everything you've got!
[01:41:28.618 --> 01:41:32.461]  Matt Sink took money from Gulf War dictators, millions.
[01:41:33.182 --> 01:41:38.186]  And Soros and the Democratic Party, he's got tens of millions of dollars himself, reportedly.
[01:41:38.586 --> 01:41:49.014]  And he sits up there as a big squat goblin, proud of his slaving ancestors from Turkey, taking over, putting the women on the ships, selling them, the men on galleys.
[01:41:50.215 --> 01:41:51.656]  And that's how he dominates you.
[01:41:51.676 --> 01:41:52.877]  That's how he teaches you.
[01:41:53.317 --> 01:41:57.681]  And Soros today, millions a year on Zodiac boats, brought into North Africa.
[01:41:59.195 --> 01:42:05.537]  To set up the same system there, and to capture the West, and he's proud of who he is, and because we're weak?
[01:42:05.557 --> 01:42:17.040]  I mean, if we don't stand up to this Soros-funded monster, his Nazi collaborator funder, Zink, who's weak and stupid, will rule you, period.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:22.521]  Because you don't have the instinct to see a monster when it's looking you right in the eyes.
[01:42:25.512 --> 01:42:33.053]  His ancestors would throw your ass on a galley, and they'd shell your mama and your sisters off, because you weren't a Muslim.
[01:42:33.713 --> 01:42:34.794]  Oh, and now he's a liberal.
[01:42:34.854 --> 01:42:36.534]  He's a sheep-dip Muslim.
[01:42:37.214 --> 01:42:37.874]  Give me a break.
[01:42:37.894 --> 01:42:40.415]  He's named after a Minyan genocide, and he's weak.
[01:42:41.215 --> 01:42:44.055]  But he wants to chain you up first and get your weapons.
[01:42:44.875 --> 01:42:47.216]  And then he'll have his way with you and your family.
[01:42:48.956 --> 01:42:50.556]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[01:42:50.656 --> 01:42:53.397]  You big, fat, bloodthirsty dick!
[01:42:54.562 --> 01:42:57.643]  You are scum and you know it, you filth.
[01:42:58.384 --> 01:43:00.965]  You big, fat, lying sack of crap.
[01:43:09.639 --> 01:43:11.160]  We're joined by our guest.
[01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.341]  Here's the headline.
[01:43:12.481 --> 01:43:21.810]  Trial pending for ex-Muslim Christian pastor arrested for sharing his testimony in Minnesota at the Mosque of America, formerly known as the Mall of America.
[01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:27.374]  Ramin Parsa was born into a very large Shiite Muslim family shortly after the Iranian Revolution.
[01:43:27.474 --> 01:43:29.576]  His family was greatly impacted by the revolution.
[01:43:29.656 --> 01:43:30.597]  One of his brothers was killed.
[01:43:30.717 --> 01:43:32.158]  Most of his family possessions were taken.
[01:43:32.279 --> 01:43:36.262]  He was raised learning Islamic laws and made to practice strict religious traditions.
[01:43:36.362 --> 01:43:37.443]  He was tortured multiple times.
[01:43:37.643 --> 01:43:38.763]  And it's good to have you on, Ramin.
[01:43:38.783 --> 01:43:39.403]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:44:01.089 --> 01:44:01.529]  Thank you.
[01:44:01.549 --> 01:44:02.889]  Thank you, Alex, for having me.
[01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:04.030]  Thanks for the opportunity.
[01:44:04.150 --> 01:44:07.991]  Tell us what happened to you while you were in Minnesota, the Minneapolis-St.
[01:44:08.031 --> 01:44:10.211]  Paul Mall of America, and what unfolded.
[01:44:10.471 --> 01:44:10.771]  Yes.
[01:44:10.931 --> 01:44:16.353]  As I said, you know, I was invited to speak at a church there in Minnesota, and I went there to speak at a church.
[01:44:16.473 --> 01:44:19.414]  After the church, I went to the mall, just to see the mall.
[01:44:19.634 --> 01:44:25.255]  And as I was visiting the mall, we talked to some Somali Muslims.
[01:44:25.315 --> 01:44:25.975]  They came to us.
[01:44:26.015 --> 01:44:28.616]  We talked and made a conversation, a private conversation.
[01:44:29.236 --> 01:44:32.138]  And then it led to, you know, they asked me if I'm a Muslim.
[01:44:32.198 --> 01:44:33.259]  I said, I used to be.
[01:44:33.379 --> 01:44:34.160]  I'm a Christian now.
[01:44:34.260 --> 01:44:35.200]  And they asked me, why?
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.381]  Why did you become a Christian?
[01:44:36.421 --> 01:44:38.883]  And I was explaining to them, giving them my testimony.
[01:44:38.943 --> 01:44:46.929]  And then that's one of the, another Muslim lady who was not a part of the conversation, she went and told the guard that this guy is harassing us and whatever.
[01:44:47.129 --> 01:44:49.571]  And then the guard came and he said, hey, you guys cannot do this.
[01:44:49.611 --> 01:44:51.672]  This is, you know, we cannot solicit here.
[01:44:51.912 --> 01:44:53.834]  And I said, no, no, I'm not soliciting here.
[01:44:54.134 --> 01:44:55.975]  And even the two ladies were listening to me.
[01:44:56.335 --> 01:44:58.717]  They were arguing with that lady that when I hear what happened,
[01:44:58.877 --> 01:45:00.177]  Why did it change?
[01:45:00.317 --> 01:45:03.999]  And then we just, you know, we saw it becoming a big motion and we just walked away.
[01:45:04.319 --> 01:45:06.960]  We said goodbye, went to a coffee shop and got some coffee.
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:10.641]  And when we came out, three guards were waiting for me.
[01:45:10.701 --> 01:45:12.801]  And then that's when they arrested me.
[01:45:13.202 --> 01:45:16.203]  They handcuffed me and then they took me to a basement in the mall.
[01:45:16.743 --> 01:45:21.824]  And they handcuffed both my hands to a metal chair, bolted to the ground.
[01:45:22.305 --> 01:45:23.605]  And I told them, I'm a pastor.
[01:45:23.965 --> 01:45:25.526]  I'm here to speak at a church.
[01:45:25.546 --> 01:45:26.586]  I'm visiting in the state.
[01:45:27.466 --> 01:45:29.208]  They said, oh, we arrested pastors before.
[01:45:30.088 --> 01:45:33.671]  And so it was so sad to see that such a thing happened in America.
[01:45:33.731 --> 01:45:34.512]  Who could imagine?
[01:45:34.552 --> 01:45:43.499]  Who could imagine that America, which is the beacon of freedom, one day be a place where you as a Christian cannot even express yourself or be arrested for sharing your faith publicly?
[01:45:43.579 --> 01:45:45.160]  And this is just a disgrace.
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:47.041]  So this is Sharia in practice.
[01:45:47.142 --> 01:45:48.743]  And I was born and raised a Muslim.
[01:45:49.183 --> 01:45:52.225]  I was taught Islam for 19 years every day of my life.
[01:45:52.706 --> 01:45:56.869]  And Islam is the darkest and the most evil ideology that has ever
[01:45:57.149 --> 01:46:13.179]  Owen Schroer here for InfoWars.com and I want to tell you guys about a great product that we have and it is the Knockout Sleep Aid Formula.
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:23.246]  Now, I've got my Knockout right here and we're going to take it and we're going to look at the actual results of the Knockout Sleep Formula in real time.
[01:46:23.306 --> 01:46:26.108]  So let me take my Knockout first.
[01:46:27.671 --> 01:46:42.247]  But while we're waiting to see the effects of the knockout, I've got some very, very, very important news that I want to get to.
[01:46:45.174 --> 01:46:52.238]  InfoWarsLife wants to bring you a sleep support formula that goes above and beyond other leading brands at an affordable price.
[01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:55.841]  Get the sleep you deserve and experience the power of knockout.
[01:46:55.861 --> 01:46:59.863]  Head on over to InfoWarsLife.com and say goodbye to fatigue.
[01:47:00.203 --> 01:47:02.324]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:47:05.987 --> 01:47:08.608]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:48.397 --> 01:47:55.342]  You know, I just spent three segments going after the Young Turks and all these people.
[01:47:57.224 --> 01:48:00.626]  We didn't get to the part where he has Sean King on there.
[01:48:02.287 --> 01:48:06.831]  Even after the Texas Sheriff and Sean King pushed fake narrative in Jasmine Barnes' murder.
[01:48:08.332 --> 01:48:10.453]  They said just blacks cannot kill other blacks.
[01:48:10.554 --> 01:48:16.318]  They said that, you know, it's so improbable that a black neighborhood
[01:48:18.246 --> 01:48:19.228]  Lower income area.
[01:48:20.169 --> 01:48:21.431]  Known for drugs in Houston.
[01:48:21.771 --> 01:48:24.155]  At 6.30 in the morning, somebody gets shot.
[01:48:24.515 --> 01:48:26.538]  And then you have witnesses saying, no, it's two black guys.
[01:48:26.558 --> 01:48:27.500]  Uh-uh!
[01:48:29.963 --> 01:48:31.726]  And see, as long as they didn't get caught...
[01:48:35.543 --> 01:48:41.046]  The sheriff could still run around and be all over the news virtually signaling about the evil white people.
[01:48:41.086 --> 01:48:45.768]  But, ooh, gosh, Wednesday you get the tip, eh, let's not.
[01:48:46.408 --> 01:48:59.374]  But other police got to him and pulled one of the fellas over and ended up finding things that led them to have him admit that he'd been the driver with the shooter and that it was a mistaken identity of another drug dealer.
[01:49:00.731 --> 01:49:04.614]  And that's all on the local news, but you're not going to see any of that.
[01:49:04.995 --> 01:49:06.776]  Remember, it's on Infowars.com.
[01:49:09.238 --> 01:49:13.002]  It's on Newswars.com, and only you can go there.
[01:49:13.262 --> 01:49:15.804]  We're uploading the video that he doesn't want anybody to see.
[01:49:16.465 --> 01:49:17.686]  It's even longer than what you just saw.
[01:49:18.886 --> 01:49:19.166]  of course.
[01:49:41.016 --> 01:49:42.217]  No, no, no, we're Chicago.
[01:49:42.458 --> 01:49:44.339]  It's all just, we have a white person!
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:45.761]  Maybe he did something wrong!
[01:49:46.061 --> 01:49:47.282]  Whites are all evil!
[01:49:47.603 --> 01:49:48.904]  Shout it from the rooftops!
[01:49:51.026 --> 01:49:52.848]  Bring in Al Sharpton 2.0!
[01:49:53.088 --> 01:49:53.729]  A.K.A.
[01:49:55.230 --> 01:49:55.791]  Red Adair!
[01:49:57.593 --> 01:49:57.653]  A.K.A.
[01:50:00.836 --> 01:50:01.697]  Another... You know what?
[01:50:01.757 --> 01:50:03.779]  I want to challenge Sean King to do a DNA test.
[01:50:09.147 --> 01:50:10.208]  Remember Rachel Delisle?
[01:50:10.468 --> 01:50:13.651]  She now has to admit she doesn't have one drop of black blood in her.
[01:50:14.652 --> 01:50:16.513]  This guy, put him back up on screen.
[01:50:17.894 --> 01:50:20.096]  I think I'm probably more black than he is.
[01:50:21.337 --> 01:50:23.439]  But notice everything's perfectly manicured.
[01:50:23.999 --> 01:50:29.083]  And the little mustache and all of it is this guy trying to look like he's a black guy.
[01:50:29.103 --> 01:50:32.826]  I think he's even got green eyes, blue eyes over there.
[01:50:33.867 --> 01:50:36.690]  What is it about, is that Rachel Delisle's son?
[01:50:39.056 --> 01:50:40.777]  I mean, he's a lot whiter than I am, too.
[01:50:43.258 --> 01:50:45.979]  And see, if he was albino, he'd have white hair and red eyes.
[01:50:45.999 --> 01:50:52.662]  So he doesn't have, like, little rabbit eyes, like an albino white person or black person.
[01:50:53.502 --> 01:50:55.783]  No, he just... Hell, I'm black, then!
[01:50:57.764 --> 01:50:59.445]  You know, actually, I am more black than he is.
[01:51:00.665 --> 01:51:02.906]  Hell, they said Bill Clinton was the first black president.
[01:51:04.807 --> 01:51:06.808]  I guess that's because he didn't like the black ladies a little bit.
[01:51:08.089 --> 01:51:10.411]  But, you know, I've joked around enough about this.
[01:51:10.451 --> 01:51:11.111]  This is sick.
[01:51:12.732 --> 01:51:19.797]  And this thing's just unraveling so fast that the media is trying to delete it all and get it down as fast as they can.
[01:51:21.259 --> 01:51:22.439]  I mean, look at her.
[01:51:22.519 --> 01:51:28.704]  She's got perfectly straight hair and then she tries to dreadlock it all out and then puts that big fake wig on top of her head.
[01:51:28.724 --> 01:51:29.985]  I guess that's a beehive?
[01:51:30.585 --> 01:51:31.546]  Get some honey out of there?
[01:51:34.388 --> 01:51:36.790]  I mean, she looks like a day-walking ginger to me.
[01:51:38.168 --> 01:51:41.210]  But see if she can virtue signal in the new leftist religion.
[01:51:43.812 --> 01:51:45.233]  She can put some bronzer on.
[01:51:45.253 --> 01:51:48.856]  I mean, Trump puts bronzer on just because, you know, tan looks good.
[01:51:48.916 --> 01:51:50.997]  But there she is, man.
[01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:52.719]  What a transformation.
[01:51:53.679 --> 01:51:58.142]  And all these fake racist mannerisms that are associated, I guess she thinks, with black people.
[01:51:58.162 --> 01:51:59.443]  She's got it down.
[01:52:00.904 --> 01:52:02.245]  You see videos over 10 years ago?
[01:52:02.285 --> 01:52:02.766]  None of that.
[01:52:03.732 --> 01:52:10.175]  But this is when the religion is white people are bad and blacks are God, but you actually aren't helping them.
[01:52:10.475 --> 01:52:18.620]  Well, the ultimate way to be the ultimate slave master is to be white and pose as if you're black and then manage all the charities and the money that comes in.
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:22.322]  And it all goes to Sean Keane.
[01:52:23.902 --> 01:52:24.863]  And Al Sharpton.
[01:52:25.383 --> 01:52:26.584]  We got a new Al Sharpton.
[01:52:26.604 --> 01:52:29.365]  You know, Al Sharpton looks like he's about half black.
[01:52:30.726 --> 01:52:32.567]  He looks like he's got some Native American in there.
[01:52:35.697 --> 01:52:36.838]  You say he's black?
[01:52:38.338 --> 01:52:45.482]  I mean, he kind of overdoes it with the ridiculous mullet and, you know, all the rest of the stuff to try to really, really act like he's black.
[01:52:46.062 --> 01:52:51.945]  But this guy is a joke, Sean King.
[01:52:53.286 --> 01:52:58.148]  And maybe I'm distracting my own self from all the huge mega massive news, but doesn't this make you sick?
[01:52:59.889 --> 01:53:01.950]  There should be a criminal investigation of the sheriff.
[01:53:03.220 --> 01:53:09.705]  Because at least Sean King made the report that they had witnesses that said it was two black men.
[01:53:12.428 --> 01:53:21.375]  But the sheriff went on and didn't say a word to anybody and didn't ever tweet it and kept tweeting till even after the guy was the first guy was busted Saturday.
[01:53:22.616 --> 01:53:23.137]  Kept saying it.
[01:53:26.199 --> 01:53:29.142]  Just needs to be investigated because I think there's reasonable
[01:53:30.307 --> 01:53:36.750]  Suspicion here with the motive and what happened and the rest of it to want to keep this gravy train going of looking for that white devil.
[01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:43.172]  If these two black guys would have slipped off and hadn't gotten that tip, why, we'll be here in three years looking for the murderer!
[01:53:43.552 --> 01:53:45.673]  That white devil of Jasmine Barnes!
[01:53:45.713 --> 01:53:47.094]  We're gonna find him someday!
[01:53:47.354 --> 01:53:49.034]  Hell, there could be tens of millions raised.
[01:53:49.454 --> 01:53:50.815]  Sheriff could be a big star!
[01:53:52.035 --> 01:53:53.156]  Looking for that white devil!
[01:53:56.209 --> 01:54:00.029]  And like Khalid Mohammed said that time, for the new Black Panther Party, he said...
[01:54:00.964 --> 01:54:04.507]  We're going to kill the women, we're going to kill the children, all the white babies, all the white women.
[01:54:04.527 --> 01:54:09.512]  They said, why do you want to kill the women, the little babies, the little beautiful blue-eyed babies?
[01:54:09.572 --> 01:54:17.959]  And he said, because every nine months the white woman lays down on her back and military enforcements roll out.
[01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:23.544]  We kill the women, we kill the children, and we kill the babies.
[01:54:23.865 --> 01:54:26.367]  Because G.D., we kill them all!
[01:54:32.637 --> 01:54:38.299]  I saw him on local news 20 years ago give that speech in Houston.
[01:54:39.399 --> 01:54:40.839]  When I was in a hotel room.
[01:54:41.300 --> 01:54:42.480]  Just randomly turned the TV on.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:44.420]  We kill the women!
[01:54:44.841 --> 01:54:46.161]  We kill the children!
[01:54:46.521 --> 01:54:48.522]  I said, yee-dee, we kill them all!
[01:54:48.762 --> 01:54:56.364]  Because every nine months a white woman lays down on her back and military enforcements roll out!
[01:55:00.322 --> 01:55:05.546]  And later, I found another clip because he said it in a debate with, uh... What was that guy's name?
[01:55:09.428 --> 01:55:10.749]  Gosh, you know, I used to have a photographic memory.
[01:55:10.789 --> 01:55:12.430]  My memory's going for stuff that's really old now.
[01:55:12.970 --> 01:55:15.872]  Anthony... Famous filmmaker.
[01:55:16.513 --> 01:55:20.075]  Did the Illuminati, uh... Illuminati records.
[01:55:22.077 --> 01:55:23.898]  Reviewed the guy 50 times over the years.
[01:55:24.878 --> 01:55:27.920]  Anthony... It'll pop in my head in a minute.
[01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:29.922]  Show...
[01:55:31.650 --> 01:55:32.991]  I'll figure out the name by the next break.
[01:55:34.071 --> 01:55:35.172]  Anthony J. Hilder.
[01:55:35.212 --> 01:55:35.772]  There you go.
[01:55:36.653 --> 01:55:37.113]  Go to YouTube.
[01:55:37.133 --> 01:55:41.255]  It's probably been taken down because it was an old clip even when YouTube came around 10-12 years ago.
[01:55:41.815 --> 01:55:44.236]  Search engine Anthony Hilder Debates.
[01:55:47.038 --> 01:55:48.418]  Anthony Hilder Debates.
[01:55:49.779 --> 01:55:50.860]  Khalid Mohammed was his name.
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.161]  And we'll play you the video.
[01:55:53.601 --> 01:55:55.462]  But I mean this is standard stuff.
[01:55:59.560 --> 01:56:02.022]  Where this is what's taught, especially down in Houston.
[01:56:03.583 --> 01:56:10.148]  And out of this whole deal... There it is, Illuminati Records 2017, Anthony J. Hilder.
[01:56:12.910 --> 01:56:13.250]  In 1967.
[01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:16.332]  And I guess they put it back out.
[01:56:16.372 --> 01:56:17.193]  Oh, you found the clip.
[01:56:18.574 --> 01:56:19.054]  We have audio?
[01:56:21.936 --> 01:56:22.456]  Why kill the women?
[01:56:24.521 --> 01:56:26.683]  First, why kill the babies?
[01:56:27.143 --> 01:56:29.585]  They're just little innocent blue-eyed babies!
[01:56:30.086 --> 01:56:33.768]  Because goddammit, they're gonna grow up one day to rule your babies!
[01:56:34.129 --> 01:56:34.789]  Kill them now!
[01:56:35.250 --> 01:56:38.052]  Why kill the women in South Africa?
[01:56:38.292 --> 01:56:43.276]  I said kill the women because the women are the military manufacturing center!
[01:56:43.316 --> 01:56:46.078]  And every nine months they lay down on their backs!
[01:56:46.278 --> 01:56:48.540]  Oh yeah, that's really who kills black people in South Africa.
[01:57:09.878 --> 01:57:11.439]  Well, let's stop there.
[01:57:12.359 --> 01:57:14.260]  You dig him up and kill him again.
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:17.261]  So, never is this the crime of the left.
[01:57:17.301 --> 01:57:18.062]  This is what's taught.
[01:57:37.401 --> 01:57:40.345]  And they're up there, like, using the poor little girl's death to create racial division.
[01:57:40.365 --> 01:57:41.727]  These are sick, evil leftists.
[01:57:42.027 --> 01:57:42.929]  They're the real racists.
[01:57:42.969 --> 01:57:43.850]  They know what they're doing.
[01:57:44.751 --> 01:57:45.412]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:45.432 --> 01:57:47.415]  I'll give the number out, your calls, a ton of other news.
[01:57:47.435 --> 01:57:47.916]  Stay with us.
[01:57:48.556 --> 01:57:49.458]  Please spread the live links.
[01:57:55.183 --> 01:58:03.576]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't have THC in it.
[01:58:03.976 --> 01:58:07.101]  It's totally legal in all 50 states.
[01:58:08.122 --> 01:58:09.845]  This is where everybody's going.
[01:58:10.865 --> 01:58:13.307]  This is what your body actually needs.
[01:58:14.068 --> 01:58:25.219]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him, now legal and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:32.586]  Now obviously there's been a giant marijuana legalization craze that Soros has funded the last 10 years.
[01:58:33.227 --> 01:58:34.408]  I've not been involved in that.
[01:58:35.768 --> 01:58:36.529]  It's a huge bubble.
[01:58:36.869 --> 01:58:38.070]  This is not marijuana.
[01:58:38.170 --> 01:58:39.631]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[01:58:39.891 --> 01:58:49.577]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes but not the bad attributes that turn people into potheads in their basements picking and eating their boogers.
[01:58:50.538 --> 01:58:53.320]  This is the good CBD.
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:56.062]  From the organic hemp oil.
[01:58:56.503 --> 01:59:13.500]  And there are so many great products that you simply need to go to InfoWarsStore.com and link over to WashingtonReserve.com or simply go to WashingtonReserve.com yourself to look at all the products, to read about the history, and to see the facts for yourself.
[01:59:13.881 --> 01:59:14.101]  It's a 360 win.
[01:59:16.255 --> 01:59:24.161]  There are different CBD rich hemp oil extractions for many, many, many different uses.
[01:59:24.662 --> 01:59:29.625]  You owe it to yourself to go look at this for yourself and to also understand it helps fund the Hemp Award.
[01:59:30.066 --> 01:59:31.647]  People wonder why I haven't gotten into CBD oil.
[01:59:32.127 --> 01:59:37.251]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it can get you arrested.
[01:59:37.692 --> 01:59:38.592]  This is not that.
[01:59:38.973 --> 01:59:40.074]  Legal in all 50 states.
[01:59:40.434 --> 01:59:42.616]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.
[01:59:42.976 --> 01:59:44.157]  It's totally legal.
[01:59:45.009 --> 01:59:51.534]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we can ship to all 50 states right now from the great website, washingtonsreserve.com.
[01:59:54.617 --> 02:00:00.522]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:05.273 --> 02:00:05.793]  We're gonna be back.
[02:00:05.893 --> 02:00:07.194]  We all know what's happening.
[02:00:07.254 --> 02:00:10.476]  It's critical news, but first, this is the heart of what's happening right now.
[02:00:10.796 --> 02:00:12.137]  Please get this video out to everyone you know.
[02:00:12.857 --> 02:00:15.718]  Everybody better decide which side they're on.
[02:00:15.738 --> 02:00:17.619]  A lot of people don't even know what sides they're on.
[02:00:17.819 --> 02:00:33.708]  That's why the globalists don't want this show on the air, because we're laying out, from the globalists' own white papers, their own statements, how the cow ate the old cabbage, and creating a very accurate map for folks to overlay with the disinformation that they see in mainstream media.
[02:00:35.146 --> 02:00:38.969]  To try to then come up with a solution to counter the globalist technocracy.
[02:00:39.269 --> 02:00:41.891]  Earth is dominated by a powerful... What's wrong?
[02:00:41.931 --> 02:00:43.953]  Nothing, nothing really.
[02:00:43.973 --> 02:00:47.756]  I just feel I need something stronger.
[02:00:57.165 --> 02:00:58.045]  Bloomberg!
[02:00:58.065 --> 02:00:59.226]  The Trump slump!
[02:00:59.246 --> 02:01:02.367]  Why the market said goodbye to the Trump bump?
[02:01:24.036 --> 02:01:38.640]  Well, because the Federal Reserve raised a bunch of interest rates and signaled with regulations that the Democrats in the deep state were going to ignore all of the innovations in the attempt to release a lot of hidden technology to get us out of the technology slump.
[02:01:38.660 --> 02:01:45.502]  50 years ago, our government drove the innovation that inspired the world and put Americans on the moon.
[02:01:46.623 --> 02:01:50.804]  Today, many of our agencies rely on painfully outdated technology.
[02:01:52.185 --> 02:01:59.090]  And yet we have the greatest people in technology that the world has ever seen right here with us in this room.
[02:01:59.471 --> 02:02:03.294]  They're openly cheerleading for the economy implode, and then blaming.
[02:02:04.485 --> 02:02:05.145]  Trump for it.
[02:02:05.626 --> 02:02:10.249]  Just like they've said in Europe, we're going to blame Italy for economic downturn.
[02:02:10.269 --> 02:02:13.331]  We're going to blame the UK for trying to get out of the unelected EU.
[02:02:13.852 --> 02:02:16.674]  It's the exact tactic of economic terrorism.
[02:02:16.694 --> 02:02:22.538]  But even bigger than the Federal Reserve, raising all these interest hikes that everyone wants to with Obama.
[02:02:23.837 --> 02:02:27.480]  They've now done, what, eight times with Trump and signaled more to come.
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:34.745]  Even worse than that is Nancy Pelosi says she won't rule out indictment impeachment for Trump.
[02:02:34.785 --> 02:02:44.351]  And of course, we've got Nancy Pelosi's daughter wearing crazy cat lady glasses to hide the fact that her and her mother have gotten over a billion dollars with her dad since Nancy was in the House.
[02:02:44.671 --> 02:02:50.035]  Just what are your feelings about this person, who you know quite well, becoming Speaker of the House for a second time?
[02:02:50.435 --> 02:02:52.337]  She'll cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding.
[02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:54.812]  That's all you need to know about her.
[02:02:55.774 --> 02:03:02.444]  When I said this was traitorous and outrageous, didn't call for her death or any violence, she went on Fox News and said I was calling for violence.
[02:03:03.205 --> 02:03:04.808]  And we confirmed that they approached...
[02:03:05.805 --> 02:03:09.190]  The Justice Department and demanded that I be arrested.
[02:03:09.410 --> 02:03:12.093]  But it's okay, she's wearing pink cat lady glasses.
[02:03:12.694 --> 02:03:15.979]  So, if Hitler wore pink cat lady glasses, it'd be okay, right?
[02:03:16.499 --> 02:03:23.429]  Hank Johnson, the guy that says that islands float, has come out and called him Hitler, and said that he should be thrown out of office.
[02:03:23.928 --> 02:03:29.430]  Much like Hitler took over the Nazi Party, Trump has taken over the Republican Party.
[02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:35.712]  We have Sheila Jackson Lee and Alexander Cortez calling for reparations to be paid to black people.
[02:03:35.892 --> 02:03:38.453]  Do you believe President Trump is a racist?
[02:03:38.473 --> 02:03:38.873]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:39.693 --> 02:03:40.474]  No question.
[02:03:40.494 --> 02:03:41.074]  How can you say that?
[02:03:41.937 --> 02:04:06.354]  When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy, when you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises, like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's night and day.
[02:04:06.374 --> 02:04:09.036]  And so now, a growing U.S.
[02:04:09.096 --> 02:04:09.597]  economy
[02:04:11.038 --> 02:04:15.761]  New jobs coming back is not seen as something that is an absolute, not as a sure thing.
[02:04:16.582 --> 02:04:20.985]  And the establishment bets on one thing bigger than anything, and it's that you'll be lazy.
[02:04:21.986 --> 02:04:27.009]  And part of that laziness is mental laziness to not have a memory and just not care.
[02:04:28.090 --> 02:04:35.195]  And you run into people that haven't trained their memories, and you run into others that had a weak memory before, but as they get older, it just gets non-existent.
[02:04:35.655 --> 02:04:39.178]  They're living in the moment-to-moment, and not in a good way.
[02:04:40.191 --> 02:04:41.353]  They're not even really conscious.
[02:04:41.373 --> 02:04:48.542]  Ladies and gentlemen, massive news just broke and I'd already confirmed this.
[02:04:48.583 --> 02:04:53.369]  When we come back, Trump's going to declare a national emergency tomorrow night at 9 o'clock Eastern.
[02:04:53.389 --> 02:04:53.790]  Stay with us.
[02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:07.813]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:05:08.894 --> 02:05:17.339]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:26.585]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:05:27.585 --> 02:05:34.632]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[02:05:35.393 --> 02:05:37.755]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:05:38.476 --> 02:05:39.357]  It really is amazing.
[02:05:39.957 --> 02:05:46.143]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:05:46.604 --> 02:05:49.266]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[02:05:50.535 --> 02:05:51.215]  Of InfoWars.
[02:05:52.056 --> 02:05:53.096]  So please spread the links.
[02:05:53.336 --> 02:05:56.377]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:05:56.657 --> 02:05:59.338]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[02:05:59.959 --> 02:06:01.019]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:06:01.259 --> 02:06:02.380]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:06:10.163 --> 02:06:18.886]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[02:06:30.370 --> 02:06:41.333]  This is a global exclusive from sources I have in the Pentagon, from sources we have close to the White House, and from our own research and understanding U.S.
[02:06:41.373 --> 02:06:42.033]  law and history.
[02:06:43.373 --> 02:06:57.777]  You have all noticed in the last year that I've said Trump must declare a national emergency to cancel the national emergency that Obama put in before he left office in December of 2016 when they knew Trump was coming in and was president-elect.
[02:06:59.204 --> 02:07:13.710]  Not just for border security or integrity of CONUS, but also so that he can then use those emergency powers to remove the bureaucrats and policies that have been put in place that circumvent his administration and his executive power.
[02:07:15.471 --> 02:07:24.835]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, but also Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com have been hammering this narrative in the last year because this is what must be done.
[02:07:25.714 --> 02:07:30.735]  And we're in a real crisis against the globalists, the CHICOMs, the EU, the economic war, the private Federal Reserve.
[02:07:30.775 --> 02:07:34.697]  We have the head of the World Bank being made to resign today.
[02:07:35.077 --> 02:07:39.518]  The President can only do that under a national emergency.
[02:07:39.778 --> 02:07:42.939]  And there are executive orders in place going back 50 plus years.
[02:07:44.687 --> 02:07:57.195]  Really before that, to the War Powers Act in 1933, that under any economic emergency, military emergency, or other emergency, particularly the border, the President can do this.
[02:07:57.756 --> 02:07:58.836]  It isn't martial law.
[02:07:58.876 --> 02:08:00.157]  It isn't a civil emergency.
[02:08:00.758 --> 02:08:02.499]  It isn't regular laws being suspended.
[02:08:03.199 --> 02:08:09.784]  It's how the executive interfaces with the agencies and the bureaucracies that are mutinous and ignoring Trump.
[02:08:10.184 --> 02:08:14.447]  So you notice, he's removed hundreds of top people that were working with the deep state.
[02:08:15.950 --> 02:08:18.574]  And it's all unfolding very, very fast.
[02:08:18.854 --> 02:08:26.845]  Now remember, I just said Saturday in a special report that Trump is preparing to institute a national emergency.
[02:08:28.686 --> 02:08:37.092]  And you notice again, going back months ago, we have pointed that out over and over and over again because we understand what is at stake here.
[02:08:37.192 --> 02:08:38.593]  I'm not calling for martial law.
[02:08:38.613 --> 02:08:39.554]  The left is spinning that.
[02:08:39.975 --> 02:08:41.496]  They're the ones wanting civil emergency.
[02:08:41.776 --> 02:08:43.037]  They're the ones wanting impeachment.
[02:08:43.377 --> 02:08:46.459]  They're the ones wanting to bankrupt and plunge the economy.
[02:08:46.740 --> 02:08:48.221]  They're the ones trying to break our borders.
[02:08:48.421 --> 02:08:51.003]  They're the ones having Antifa go out and storm everywhere.
[02:08:51.897 --> 02:08:56.921]  Reagan declared a national emergency with the strike at the air traffic controllers.
[02:08:57.241 --> 02:09:00.363]  He had to declare it to order them back, essential employees.
[02:09:01.825 --> 02:09:02.845]  There's been other emergencies.
[02:09:02.925 --> 02:09:09.290]  Obama used one, and Bush used one, to hold us hostage and give trillions to foreign banks in 2008 and 2009.
[02:09:11.212 --> 02:09:20.319]  Paulson, the head of the Treasury, said there'll be martial law, tanks in the street, and blood if you don't back the President's emergency to Congress, if you try to buck it.
[02:09:21.018 --> 02:09:23.900]  They don't appropriate it, but the President could have still done it on his own.
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:29.344]  So, Trump's doing this not to sell us out to the New World Order, but to stand up against it.
[02:09:30.185 --> 02:09:33.568]  And this country is in a major, major crisis.
[02:09:34.108 --> 02:09:48.219]  So, here it is today, Fox News just minutes ago, talking about his announcement dealing with the wall, and it being steel and not concrete, which is still a wall, that he'll be giving a special speech tomorrow night.
[02:09:49.625 --> 02:09:58.232]  It's going to be from the Oval Office, and it's going to be on the country being in a crisis, and the President's going to declare the national emergency tomorrow night.
[02:09:59.353 --> 02:10:12.523]  Then on Wednesday, there'll be a messenger from the White House that marches into the new Congress, into the House of Representatives, and announces to the Speaker of the House that the President has declared an emergency.
[02:10:13.424 --> 02:10:15.406]  Now normally they don't cover it when they do this.
[02:10:15.626 --> 02:10:18.048]  Every President's done it since Roosevelt.
[02:10:19.735 --> 02:10:20.876]  They don't want you knowing about this.
[02:10:21.037 --> 02:10:22.238]  This is how they've done all this stuff.
[02:10:22.999 --> 02:10:31.128]  This time, when that emissary from the President marches into the Sergeant of Arms of the House of Representatives, it's going to be all over the news.
[02:10:32.070 --> 02:10:33.471]  Like it's a big, bad, evil thing.
[02:10:34.572 --> 02:10:36.054]  So, how do I know this?
[02:10:36.154 --> 02:10:37.536]  I have sources saying it was imminent.
[02:10:37.576 --> 02:10:39.018]  I've been telling you for a year it needs to happen.
[02:10:40.111 --> 02:10:47.462]  We're going to pull up the articles, not just from last week, but a year ago, six months ago, two months ago, three months ago, October 27th, all of them.
[02:10:47.542 --> 02:10:49.104]  We're going to get that up on screen for you.
[02:10:49.585 --> 02:10:52.750]  Now, here is Fox News, and the President hints at it.
[02:10:53.170 --> 02:10:54.933]  He says, this country is in an emergency.
[02:10:55.073 --> 02:10:55.373]  Here it is.
[02:10:56.014 --> 02:10:57.976]  We'll build a steel barrier.
[02:10:58.216 --> 02:10:58.697]  Steel.
[02:10:59.418 --> 02:11:00.739]  It'll be made out of steel.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:04.383]  It'll be less obtrusive and it'll be stronger.
[02:11:05.244 --> 02:11:12.411]  But it'll be less obtrusive, stronger, and we're able to use our great companies to make it by using steel.
[02:11:13.519 --> 02:11:14.620]  We have Fox Team coverage.
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:17.683]  Mike Emanuel on Capitol Hill with reaction from lawmakers.
[02:11:17.744 --> 02:11:22.428]  But we begin with John Roberts who is live at the White House and that news coming in just a few moments ago.
[02:11:22.469 --> 02:11:26.313]  The president to do a primetime address tomorrow night at 9 p.m.
[02:11:26.353 --> 02:11:27.013]  from the White House.
[02:11:27.053 --> 02:11:27.234]  John.
[02:11:27.975 --> 02:11:29.116]  Dana, good afternoon to you.
[02:11:29.176 --> 02:11:44.762]  Yeah, with the Christmas holidays, the New Year's holiday over and everybody back to work except for federal workers, of course, and people focused, the President wants to make a case for why he needs to get the money to build a border barrier with a primetime address tomorrow night.
[02:11:45.102 --> 02:11:51.825]  We do not know if it will be in the Oval Office yet or if it might be one of the other many rooms here at the White House.
[02:11:52.405 --> 02:11:59.551]  When you do something from the Oval Office, it tends to have a lot more importance attached to it than if you did it, say, from the Map Room or somewhere like that.
[02:11:59.691 --> 02:12:04.375]  We expect that the President will probably tweet the location coming up here in the next few minutes.
[02:12:04.415 --> 02:12:12.702]  But it's clear that he will, tomorrow night in this address at 9 o'clock, make the argument from a national security standpoint that the money is needed for the wall.
[02:12:12.722 --> 02:12:20.229]  The President tweeting, quote, I am pleased to inform you that I will address the nation on the humanitarian and national security crisis.
[02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:32.893]  The president will also travel to the southern border on Thursday to promote the need for billions of dollars to build a steel barrier along some parts of the border.
[02:12:33.694 --> 02:12:38.835]  He is going to be going, we have confirmed through law enforcement sources, to the McAllen, Texas area.
[02:12:39.216 --> 02:12:48.719]  Now what's interesting is there's about four miles of steel barricade at the border crossing there between the area south of McAllen and Reynosa.
[02:12:49.199 --> 02:12:49.740]  In Texas.
[02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:58.087]  But that's an area where it's very difficult to build a wall because you've got the Rio Grande meandering its way all the way west to El Paso and all the way east to Brownsville.
[02:12:58.548 --> 02:13:04.794]  And you have a lot of private landowners there who do not want to be cut off from the river by a border fence.
[02:13:04.874 --> 02:13:09.097]  So it's likely that his plans for a border fence would not be applicable to that area.
[02:13:09.118 --> 02:13:13.722]  But of course there are large swaths of New Mexico, Arizona and California where it would.
[02:13:14.082 --> 02:13:22.347]  In a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee, Chairman Richard Shelby, the President adding some detail to what he wants, saying, quote, Okay, so that's from Fox News, just literally like 10-12 minutes ago.
[02:13:33.379 --> 02:13:37.162]  I'm in the break room, and I see the President say, because this country's in an emergency.
[02:13:37.542 --> 02:13:39.183]  Well, I know that's the action he's got to take.
[02:13:39.303 --> 02:13:40.284]  I know he's been mulling it.
[02:13:40.664 --> 02:13:43.426]  We first told you this over a year ago, another global exclusive.
[02:13:43.746 --> 02:13:45.888]  And you watch, and sometimes he changes plans.
[02:13:46.448 --> 02:13:52.492]  But 95% chance tomorrow, Trump will declare a national emergency.
[02:13:53.913 --> 02:13:55.954]  So this is, this is, this is happening.
[02:13:56.575 --> 02:13:57.936]  And I did a special report.
[02:14:00.012 --> 02:14:04.074]  On Saturday saying the president is preparing a national emergency.
[02:14:04.454 --> 02:14:10.637]  He is preparing to introduce a national emergency to the public.
[02:14:11.317 --> 02:14:18.660]  And then if the globalists try to block securing it and activate their anti for other terror groups, there's the Mike Adams article we were talking about from a few months ago.
[02:14:19.181 --> 02:14:21.602]  The president is set to deal with that.
[02:14:22.222 --> 02:14:25.066]  So Trump has declared a national emergency to stop the deep state.
[02:14:25.486 --> 02:14:33.898]  January 4th, January 5th article, President Trump is preparing the public for the introduction of national emergency.
[02:14:35.079 --> 02:14:37.883]  In fact, we probably should just get my special report.
[02:14:38.344 --> 02:14:39.085]  It's pretty powerful.
[02:14:40.563 --> 02:14:49.731]  From this weekend and air that in some of the segments because I was particularly focused and I really laid out why the president needs to do this and the reasons for it.
[02:14:50.291 --> 02:14:56.096]  And so what we'll do is I'm going to open the phones up on this subject and others, but particularly this one.
[02:14:56.956 --> 02:15:06.945]  And then I think Gerald Salente, who always does a great job, will be fine with me taking a couple segments of the start of the next hour before he comes on to air my piece on that.
[02:15:06.965 --> 02:15:09.507]  But I want to be extremely focused and clear here.
[02:15:11.607 --> 02:15:13.629]  We're already under Obama's emergency.
[02:15:13.649 --> 02:15:16.791]  He has to stay behind embedded networks working against the country.
[02:15:16.831 --> 02:15:17.612]  That's now been admitted.
[02:15:17.632 --> 02:15:18.973]  I told you that two and a half years ago.
[02:15:19.413 --> 02:15:20.714]  But when he was leaving, he pulled that.
[02:15:21.094 --> 02:15:21.575]  And then he did.
[02:15:22.776 --> 02:15:23.696]  We know how this stuff works.
[02:15:24.557 --> 02:15:36.967]  And so, the way it operates is they've built this whole infrastructure around COG, Continuity of Government and other systems, where the President can't change any of this unless he exercises his power to remove it.
[02:15:38.143 --> 02:15:43.006]  So, if you're cutting a kid out of a car, it's the car wreck that put him in the car all hurt.
[02:15:43.266 --> 02:15:44.167]  You're cutting him out.
[02:15:44.247 --> 02:15:45.128]  That's the emergency.
[02:15:45.288 --> 02:15:46.549]  But the wreck's already happened.
[02:15:47.129 --> 02:15:48.790]  So, they're going to spend this as martial law.
[02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:50.591]  That's not what it is.
[02:15:51.552 --> 02:15:57.075]  It's the president having to exercise executive power to get back control of the bureaucracy.
[02:15:57.356 --> 02:15:58.396]  We'll get the number out when we come back.
[02:15:58.436 --> 02:15:58.796]  Stay with us.
[02:16:04.070 --> 02:16:05.932]  We're ending the year.
[02:16:06.312 --> 02:16:07.293]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[02:16:07.373 --> 02:16:08.294]  It's been an insane year.
[02:16:09.595 --> 02:16:17.181]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[02:16:18.262 --> 02:16:29.211]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[02:16:30.072 --> 02:16:31.053]  And that the globalists
[02:16:32.168 --> 02:16:38.391]  Wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[02:16:38.411 --> 02:16:43.854]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[02:16:43.874 --> 02:16:46.556]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[02:16:46.896 --> 02:16:48.857]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[02:16:50.518 --> 02:16:52.399]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[02:16:52.439 --> 02:16:54.800]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[02:16:55.661 --> 02:16:58.282]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[02:16:59.663 --> 02:17:01.044]  But our aircraft didn't have
[02:17:02.728 --> 02:17:04.988]  Radar.
[02:17:05.128 --> 02:17:16.230]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[02:17:16.450 --> 02:17:27.032]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[02:17:28.013 --> 02:17:29.993]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it,
[02:17:31.004 --> 02:17:34.067]  That they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[02:17:34.948 --> 02:17:42.156]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[02:17:42.176 --> 02:17:45.760]  Footage we're showing is Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:46.841]  That's a separate battle.
[02:17:47.642 --> 02:17:47.802]  And so...
[02:17:54.895 --> 02:17:59.659]  They would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:02.922]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[02:18:03.803 --> 02:18:09.187]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flak, comes from that.
[02:18:10.068 --> 02:18:17.655]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flak is.
[02:18:19.571 --> 02:18:23.253]  And we find out where the biggest attack is and what pisses them off the most.
[02:18:24.053 --> 02:18:29.915]  And lo and behold, that turns out to be the most accurate information.
[02:18:29.975 --> 02:18:33.837]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[02:18:34.861 --> 02:18:43.769]  And I want to point out, we've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best storable food.
[02:18:44.169 --> 02:18:57.180]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:59.122]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[02:19:00.106 --> 02:19:08.391]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out until January 1st.
[02:19:09.091 --> 02:19:14.294]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support, selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[02:19:14.814 --> 02:19:18.276]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job, too.
[02:19:19.036 --> 02:19:26.380]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything, double Patriot points on your next order, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[02:19:26.861 --> 02:19:29.022]  That is extended, but only a few days left.
[02:19:29.762 --> 02:19:32.145]  Until the end of this year.
[02:19:33.006 --> 02:19:41.136]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping and a free t-shirt.
[02:19:42.193 --> 02:19:44.834]  And of course, so many other great items.
[02:19:44.874 --> 02:19:50.656]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver or something like that.
[02:19:50.676 --> 02:19:54.957]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there.
[02:19:55.297 --> 02:19:56.338]  A true 360 win.
[02:19:56.738 --> 02:19:58.218]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:19:58.398 --> 02:20:00.079]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:20:05.961 --> 02:20:08.602]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:19.723 --> 02:20:29.468]  We're good to go.
[02:20:55.532 --> 02:21:02.356]  You know, most men spend their time studying how football works, or how to act cool, and that's okay.
[02:21:02.516 --> 02:21:04.997]  Or how to have a bigger truck, which I got a big truck, I like that too.
[02:21:05.758 --> 02:21:08.039]  But you know, I've spent my time studying how the world works.
[02:21:08.959 --> 02:21:14.843]  And when I went and saw the movie Vice, which has got some disinfo on it, but it's very well done overall.
[02:21:16.013 --> 02:21:22.176]  It's Tick Cheney obsessed with COG and continuity of government and the power of the executive.
[02:21:22.856 --> 02:21:30.699]  And by the president letting him operate as a co-executive, he then was able to create a fourth branch of government.
[02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:33.841]  That's how powerful the executive is, if it's unopposed.
[02:21:36.314 --> 02:21:41.578]  Now, they've been using the executive to transfer power away from Congress, the courts, and the people.
[02:21:41.778 --> 02:21:46.101]  Trump is using it to claw it back, and doing it under constitutional emergency.
[02:21:47.362 --> 02:21:55.047]  So just as I said at the beginning of the show today, all indicators are Trump is taking the gloves off and putting the big boy pants on.
[02:21:59.625 --> 02:22:08.132]  And he's firing the CHICOM World Bank head, who was working with the Chinese to give them all our tax money to take over Africa, mainly, and Latin America.
[02:22:08.412 --> 02:22:09.313]  I mean, what treason?
[02:22:09.353 --> 02:22:11.875]  And Trump called out a year ago and just sacked the guy.
[02:22:12.215 --> 02:22:20.461]  And this all indicates the national emergency, as I said back in October, has already been declared.
[02:22:22.503 --> 02:22:29.188]  And they're going to send an emissary from the White House Wednesday morning.
[02:22:30.523 --> 02:22:33.805]  To the session of Congress, and is he going to declare?
[02:22:34.406 --> 02:22:35.947]  I'm going from memory, we need to look this up.
[02:22:37.148 --> 02:22:38.389]  It's declared to the House.
[02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:41.271]  Sometimes they send an emissary to both.
[02:22:41.291 --> 02:22:43.753]  Sometimes they have the Vice President do it, but that gives too much fanfare.
[02:22:44.153 --> 02:22:49.197]  Usually they slip it under the rug, under the door, because it can get a little sticky.
[02:22:50.318 --> 02:22:54.301]  If they're using it to transfer trillions to foreign banks, or they're using it to do things like that.
[02:22:55.370 --> 02:23:00.671]  But this is the president announcing an emergency, generally for war or famine or calamity.
[02:23:00.751 --> 02:23:05.813]  And our borders, the left keeps saying, oh there's no border problem, oh yeah, look at Europe, look at here, give me a break!
[02:23:08.233 --> 02:23:09.994]  So, they're going to spin this as martial law.
[02:23:10.034 --> 02:23:10.934]  This is the opposite.
[02:23:12.194 --> 02:23:13.655]  The country has been crashed.
[02:23:14.375 --> 02:23:15.935]  The globalists are trying to bring it down.
[02:23:15.955 --> 02:23:18.576]  I'm going to explain this again because the media is going to misrepresent it.
[02:23:19.616 --> 02:23:22.037]  Obama declared new emergencies.
[02:23:23.448 --> 02:23:25.829]  Six of the eight years he was in office.
[02:23:25.889 --> 02:23:28.250]  By the way, the emergencies were extended.
[02:23:29.050 --> 02:23:34.192]  So he only had to do it six times because he wanted to change something and why he said there was an emergency.
[02:23:35.712 --> 02:23:46.856]  So you're going to learn that the president in October declared a classified national emergency to the executive and now he's either going to have a deal by tomorrow night
[02:23:48.962 --> 02:23:54.506]  That Pelosi says that they're going to do the wall and all the rest of it, or he'll declare the national emergency.
[02:23:54.546 --> 02:23:55.587]  But it's already been done.
[02:23:55.987 --> 02:23:56.508]  So it doesn't matter.
[02:23:56.528 --> 02:23:57.228]  You understand how that works?
[02:23:57.809 --> 02:24:01.932]  He just hasn't declared it to Congress to let him know that he's overriding them.
[02:24:02.512 --> 02:24:07.196]  And the only way you could override the president in an emergency is impeachment or assassination.
[02:24:07.856 --> 02:24:09.497]  It is its own separate branch of government.
[02:24:10.078 --> 02:24:15.922]  But you have, just as state legislatures used to until 1913 and the 16th Amendment,
[02:24:17.725 --> 02:24:19.086]  They could recall U.S.
[02:24:19.106 --> 02:24:19.506]  Senators.
[02:24:20.207 --> 02:24:23.008]  They were creatures of the state to balance out the federal government.
[02:24:23.549 --> 02:24:24.930]  House members are generally elected.
[02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:31.153]  Senate members were voted for by the legislature to create a parliamentary check and balance.
[02:24:31.654 --> 02:24:37.938]  The same year we got the Federal Reserve Act, the income tax, we got the Senators becoming federal creatures.
[02:24:39.279 --> 02:24:44.142]  Well, that was a major loss of states' rights and states' powers.
[02:24:44.902 --> 02:24:45.843]  And I believe we should bring back
[02:24:46.834 --> 02:24:48.155]  Where we were before the 16th Amendment.
[02:24:48.936 --> 02:24:50.477]  So things have gotten way out of balance.
[02:24:50.977 --> 02:24:52.718]  And before, the executive had too much power.
[02:24:53.239 --> 02:24:55.861]  But everything Trump's doing with executive power is very judicious.
[02:24:56.201 --> 02:24:58.783]  The Supreme Court's been saying he's right on this stuff.
[02:24:59.764 --> 02:25:01.545]  And that's where we're headed here.
[02:25:01.565 --> 02:25:03.767]  That's why the Democrats are so scared.
[02:25:03.947 --> 02:25:05.348]  They're not worried about the future of the court.
[02:25:05.448 --> 02:25:06.509]  They think they're going to sew this up.
[02:25:06.989 --> 02:25:14.374]  But if the Supreme Court stands with Trump during all of this that's coming up, it's going to be a big problem.
[02:25:14.595 --> 02:25:16.016]  You see, the House indicts
[02:25:17.315 --> 02:25:23.997]  The Senate tries, and it's not going to go there because Trump has all the Trump cards.
[02:25:25.778 --> 02:25:26.598]  The Ace of Spades.
[02:25:27.278 --> 02:25:30.059]  The Clintons and the Obamas were heavily involved with Saudi Arabia on 9-11.
[02:25:30.959 --> 02:25:32.300]  And he has a bunch of other Ace cards.
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:35.120]  He's got a handful of Ace of Spades.
[02:25:36.061 --> 02:25:37.321]  This isn't like a regular card game.
[02:25:37.801 --> 02:25:39.622]  He's probably got 20 Ace of Spades.
[02:25:40.768 --> 02:25:42.169]  Twenty-eighths of clubs.
[02:25:43.069 --> 02:25:44.230]  It just goes down the line from there.
[02:25:44.250 --> 02:25:44.850]  It just gets better.
[02:25:45.430 --> 02:25:46.130]  It's more sickening.
[02:25:46.871 --> 02:25:51.733]  And this is just an epic time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:51.753 --> 02:25:52.613]  You need to understand that.
[02:25:53.914 --> 02:25:54.994]  And I'm proud of InfoWars.
[02:25:55.795 --> 02:25:59.356]  I'm proud of our audience, because you have lobbied the President to declare the national emergency.
[02:26:00.077 --> 02:26:02.498]  Quite frankly, he's never given an Oval Office address.
[02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:06.311]  They're all saying, oh, we don't know if it'll be in the Oval Office.
[02:26:06.331 --> 02:26:06.631]  We don't know.
[02:26:06.671 --> 02:26:09.873]  No, it's going to be in the Oval Office if he declares a national emergency.
[02:26:10.113 --> 02:26:16.217]  And I'm saying the national emergency has already been declared, but it will be officially declared.
[02:26:16.597 --> 02:26:30.165]  And even if Pelosi agrees to pass the border funding and back off, Trump will say to speed it up and to hurry it up and to make it work better, I'm going to go ahead and declare the emergency.
[02:26:30.325 --> 02:26:31.565]  Oh, look, now Schiff's saying it.
[02:26:31.726 --> 02:26:32.066]  There it is.
[02:26:33.462 --> 02:26:43.406]  Trump may declare a national emergency, and then Schiff comes out and says he has the power to, but I really hope he doesn't.
[02:26:43.446 --> 02:26:44.707]  Look how scared he looks.
[02:26:45.087 --> 02:26:52.810]  These criminals that have used old executive power left behind by Obama, hoping Trump didn't figure this out, hoping Trump didn't remove it.
[02:26:53.931 --> 02:26:56.632]  But see, even Schiff can't lie.
[02:26:57.332 --> 02:26:58.653]  I forgot I saw that video this morning.
[02:27:00.214 --> 02:27:05.259]  And because he knows it's in the Constitution, it's in the law, he just goes, well, he has that power, but I hope he doesn't.
[02:27:07.621 --> 02:27:08.662]  It's not about the wall.
[02:27:08.822 --> 02:27:09.923]  The wall's only part of it.
[02:27:10.603 --> 02:27:13.646]  It's about checkmating these creatures.
[02:27:14.547 --> 02:27:19.831]  Again, Obama put executive powers in and emergencies that are still operating.
[02:27:20.703 --> 02:27:22.003]  Trump has to reverse it.
[02:27:22.043 --> 02:27:23.944]  He has to fire the head of the Federal Reserve.
[02:27:24.204 --> 02:27:25.344]  Fire the head of the World Bank.
[02:27:25.464 --> 02:27:26.305]  Oops, just happened.
[02:27:26.645 --> 02:27:27.905]  But for face-saving, he resigned.
[02:27:28.525 --> 02:27:30.246]  He's gonna fire them all!
[02:27:30.906 --> 02:27:39.329]  It's like the globalists are Tokyo, and Godzilla's Trump, and he just came out of the water, and he's pissed.
[02:27:41.149 --> 02:27:47.571]  Maybe we should play Blue Oyster Cult Godzilla when we come back.
[02:27:48.071 --> 02:27:49.532]  Because if they want to fight,
[02:27:50.796 --> 02:27:52.619]  Better believe they're gonna get one.
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:55.423]  This is the joy of information war.
[02:27:56.525 --> 02:27:58.447]  Only thing better would be, I guess...
[02:28:00.711 --> 02:28:02.532]  The hors d'oeuvres of the physical dainties.
[02:28:02.672 --> 02:28:06.153]  But this is what it's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:06.853 --> 02:28:08.894]  And the country's been on its deathbed.
[02:28:08.954 --> 02:28:09.915]  China's threatening war.
[02:28:10.235 --> 02:28:11.535]  We're arresting the Chinese spies.
[02:28:11.575 --> 02:28:12.336]  They're rolling them up.
[02:28:12.596 --> 02:28:20.599]  And that's why the rest of the deep state is flipping out because they are complicit traitors and they're fighting for their dirty political and physical lives.
[02:28:20.939 --> 02:28:23.440]  General McChrystal and all this other trash.
[02:28:24.921 --> 02:28:27.962]  All these corrupt billionaires on the Chai Com Payroll look scared, don't they?
[02:28:28.142 --> 02:28:29.923]  Because they're un-American scum!
[02:28:30.888 --> 02:28:38.009]  Their army is a bunch of Antifa professor meth heads and other asswipes.
[02:28:38.029 --> 02:28:39.010]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:28:39.330 --> 02:28:40.930]  I want to talk about the national emergency.
[02:28:41.430 --> 02:28:42.350]  You think Trump's right?
[02:28:42.390 --> 02:28:43.131]  You know it's coming?
[02:28:43.811 --> 02:28:45.471]  How will the enemy hit back?
[02:28:45.491 --> 02:28:45.771]  877-789-2539.
[02:28:46.391 --> 02:28:49.192]  Trump gave us a prelude to this last week.
[02:28:49.572 --> 02:28:54.293]  He said it's going to be a hell of a year, so strap yourselves in and get ready for a wild ride!
[02:28:54.653 --> 02:28:55.453]  Woo-hoo!
[02:28:55.513 --> 02:28:56.113]  Yeah!
[02:28:56.713 --> 02:28:57.714]  Yeah!
[02:28:57.734 --> 02:28:57.774]  877-789-2539.
[02:29:02.166 --> 02:29:06.569]  In the last eight years, we've seen the rise and now fall of the cryptocurrencies.
[02:29:07.530 --> 02:29:13.454]  And the entire time, I refused to take sponsors to fund our operation from the cryptocurrency market.
[02:29:13.914 --> 02:29:23.340]  Not because I thought every company was bad or that the whole thing's a scam, but at a gut level, I knew it was a giant bubble and I didn't want to be associated with that.
[02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:25.081]  Gut level, just couldn't do it.
[02:29:25.601 --> 02:29:27.903]  There have been many other sponsors I've refused.
[02:29:28.483 --> 02:29:40.927]  I have been offered and refused millions of dollars in sponsorship that would have been great to fight the info war from legitimate companies that sell marijuana-derived CBD oil, which has incredible attributes.
[02:29:41.007 --> 02:29:44.629]  Everybody knows about it on so many fronts and helps a lot of people.
[02:29:44.789 --> 02:29:53.732]  But the reason I haven't gotten involved is the law hasn't been clear and some states, even though it doesn't get you high, see it as illegal.
[02:29:54.597 --> 02:30:14.489]  But now they have developed and certified for years CBD rich oil derived from hemp that is completely legal in all 50 states and there are so many different permutations and combinations of what it's able to do and what the studies show it's done that it's mind-blowing.
[02:30:15.249 --> 02:30:17.491]  So we've worked with one of the biggest companies in the nation.
[02:30:18.491 --> 02:30:22.214]  And they wanted to just work with us openly because they want to stand up for America and freedom.
[02:30:22.234 --> 02:30:22.915]  They're patriots.
[02:30:23.255 --> 02:30:34.564]  But I said, listen, you just need to create your own new website for a private label for us, where you handle it all, where they get the best hemp-derived CBD oil, legal in all 50 states, from you.
[02:30:35.105 --> 02:30:35.945]  You drop ship it.
[02:30:36.045 --> 02:30:36.686]  You get it out.
[02:30:36.866 --> 02:30:37.767]  You have the website.
[02:30:38.367 --> 02:30:38.988]  I promote it.
[02:30:39.168 --> 02:30:40.049]  I send people there.
[02:30:40.329 --> 02:30:43.251]  And that way they're getting the very best from the experts.
[02:30:43.952 --> 02:30:47.395]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, nothing wrong with marijuana-derived CBD oil.
[02:30:48.516 --> 02:30:58.144]  The problem is some of the public and governments and municipalities get confused and sometimes people get in trouble with CBD oil if it's too strong.
[02:30:58.905 --> 02:31:03.629]  This isn't CBD oil derived from marijuana that's high in THC.
[02:31:03.930 --> 02:31:12.037]  This is derived from industrial high-quality organic hemp and it's legal in all 50 states and now
[02:31:13.220 --> 02:31:23.330]  Trump has signed the executive order allowing the industrial growing of hemp, so we won't even have to import it from Canada to Colorado, where it's then produced, bottled, and distributed.
[02:31:23.610 --> 02:31:25.452]  Now listen, I know a lot about it.
[02:31:25.492 --> 02:31:26.073]  I've researched it.
[02:31:26.113 --> 02:31:31.578]  I've turned down probably 20, 30 companies who've been wanting to sponsor us the last six years.
[02:31:31.598 --> 02:31:32.999]  It's gotten really crazy the last two.
[02:31:33.820 --> 02:31:45.728]  But now that the law is clear, now that our listeners can't get burned, now that we have a partnership with one of the top companies in the United States known for their organic quality, known for being patriots,
[02:31:47.043 --> 02:31:54.888]  They have created a new website and a private label of their entire spectrum of award-winning products called Washington's Reserve.
[02:31:55.568 --> 02:32:11.797]  And there are so many attributes, so many different things that hemp-derived, hemp-rich CBD oil has to offer that you just need to go to washingtonsreserve.com for yourself and see it all, because they have more than 40 products.
[02:32:12.157 --> 02:32:14.919]  Now, remember, the Globalists have tried to take our merchant accounts away.
[02:32:15.119 --> 02:32:16.120]  They've tried to shut us down.
[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:18.100]  They've tried to boycott us.
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:18.921]  They've tried to sue us.
[02:32:19.441 --> 02:32:25.923]  And I said in the last six months, I'm going to move, not away from a direct sales marketing of great products to you to fund us.
[02:32:26.143 --> 02:32:33.905]  We're still going to do that for themforwarslife.com, but we're also going to bring on the best sponsors in the country, the very best products.
[02:32:34.005 --> 02:32:35.825]  And this is the first big one.
[02:32:36.186 --> 02:32:37.046]  So I'm very excited.
[02:32:37.066 --> 02:32:37.846]  Be sure and go there.
[02:32:37.926 --> 02:32:44.548]  Experience the power of high quality hemp extract with CBD exclusively available at washingtonsreserve.com for the
[02:32:44.548 --> 02:32:47.090]  So, highest quality, the lowest prices.
[02:32:47.530 --> 02:32:53.314]  It's all there, ladies and gentlemen, at washingtonsreserve.com, and you're helping fund the info war the whole time.
[02:33:05.303 --> 02:33:07.945]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:37.060 --> 02:33:38.501]  We're good to go.
[02:34:12.878 --> 02:34:14.035]  But he ain't going nowhere.
[02:34:52.724 --> 02:34:53.327]  Let's go
[02:35:07.478 --> 02:35:15.845]  We are back live, the most demonized, most lied about, most attacked, most feared broadcast in the world by the globalists.
[02:35:16.645 --> 02:35:28.695]  Yeah, they see us a little bit like Godzilla, tearing down their pedophile rings, their radical Islamic invasion operations, their attack on the family, their tainted vaccines, their GMO crap.
[02:35:31.297 --> 02:35:36.682]  We do need Godzilla to tear down Trump's 5G, but he just hears it'll create 5 million jobs and goes, oh, let's do it.
[02:35:37.329 --> 02:35:38.469]  We're going to get him educated on that.
[02:35:38.509 --> 02:35:39.130]  He's not perfect.
[02:35:39.150 --> 02:35:40.670]  All right, we're taking your phone calls.
[02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:49.933]  Trump is set to declare a national emergency, not just a normal, oh, we're in an emergency here or there, but in the federal government to circumvent the bureaucracies and things that are holding back America.
[02:35:49.953 --> 02:35:57.836]  You see the firing, it's not a resignation of the CHICOM operative that transferred hundreds of billions of our money to the CHICOMs as if they need any more of it.
[02:35:59.156 --> 02:36:03.338]  America is now taking control of all the international systems that it helped create
[02:36:05.168 --> 02:36:08.690]  And what we claim was for promoting democracy worldwide has really been for promoting globalism.
[02:36:09.831 --> 02:36:10.532]  And the New World Order.
[02:36:11.713 --> 02:36:13.074]  And crony capitalism.
[02:36:13.154 --> 02:36:21.039]  And Trump is taking control of the bureaucracy at an accelerated rate as we enter, hard to believe, the third year of this term.
[02:36:21.479 --> 02:36:22.740]  And the battle is joined.
[02:36:23.361 --> 02:36:25.302]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls right now.
[02:36:25.322 --> 02:36:29.125]  A lot of people probably noticed I haven't plugged today, one time.
[02:36:30.609 --> 02:36:33.650]  Get a t-shirt, get a book, get some great supplements, help fund our operation.
[02:36:33.970 --> 02:36:36.251]  I'm so focused on all these developments, I'm not doing it.
[02:36:36.711 --> 02:36:40.133]  But just know this, without you supporting us at Infowarsstore.com, we wouldn't be here.
[02:36:41.333 --> 02:36:50.596]  And you know the Democrats in Soros have tried to run off all our sponsors over the years, and then they try to take our banking away, and brag about that, getting some of our payment processors.
[02:36:50.697 --> 02:36:52.157]  I mean, this is the criminal garbage.
[02:36:52.417 --> 02:36:54.178]  And now they're trying to take Franklin Graham's.
[02:36:55.011 --> 02:36:55.331]  We're good.
[02:37:12.657 --> 02:37:16.639]  Let's just build these sites, have it be a private label that you run, that's highest quality.
[02:37:17.359 --> 02:37:19.720]  I know it's the best because of all the studies and all the awards.
[02:37:20.340 --> 02:37:24.402]  We put it out, and we have all the benefits of giving people great products, funding our operations.
[02:37:24.862 --> 02:37:30.044]  You fund your operation, and they can pound sand trying to harass you and your employees.
[02:37:30.545 --> 02:37:33.246]  And so the first one is Washington's Reserve.
[02:37:34.886 --> 02:37:36.987]  WashingtonsReserve.com.
[02:37:37.387 --> 02:37:39.648]  There's big banners up on Infowars.com.
[02:37:43.263 --> 02:37:46.284]  And PrisonPlanet.com, I don't like marijuana.
[02:37:47.725 --> 02:37:49.546]  We still fly Old Glory down at the courthouse.
[02:37:51.226 --> 02:37:57.769]  No, to get serious, we had a magazine years ago, it was successful, but not successful enough, so I quit doing it.
[02:37:58.989 --> 02:38:04.171]  And we got a CBD oil advertiser in it that was from hemp, had no THC.
[02:38:04.992 --> 02:38:05.252]  None.
[02:38:06.392 --> 02:38:10.374]  But just the really good organic hemp that has the good properties that have shown all the good things medically.
[02:38:10.394 --> 02:38:11.574]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:38:11.594 --> 02:38:12.355]  Go do your own research.
[02:38:13.362 --> 02:38:20.024]  And even family in East Texas are like, Alex, you're sure you're not selling the marijuana to the kids, are you?
[02:38:20.044 --> 02:38:24.765]  Because they saw the magazine, and I said, no.
[02:38:25.185 --> 02:38:28.406]  Well, I saw a marijuana leaf on there!
[02:38:28.486 --> 02:38:31.087]  Yeah, there's over 300 varieties of hemp we know of that doesn't have THC.
[02:38:31.427 --> 02:38:32.267]  But that's all the good stuff.
[02:38:32.287 --> 02:38:33.287]  Of course, Washington grew it.
[02:38:33.747 --> 02:38:35.308]  The Constitution, Bill of Rights is on it.
[02:38:36.252 --> 02:38:36.932]  It's amazing.
[02:38:37.493 --> 02:38:38.894]  And I'm not going to go over all the benefits.
[02:38:38.934 --> 02:38:40.235]  We have over 30 products.
[02:38:40.575 --> 02:38:43.577]  This is in the top three companies in the nation.
[02:38:44.377 --> 02:38:45.838]  And I'm not going to even get into who it is.
[02:38:46.138 --> 02:38:46.959]  They're happy to do it.
[02:38:46.999 --> 02:38:47.559]  They just don't care.
[02:38:47.619 --> 02:38:48.300]  But I'm going to leave it.
[02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:51.221]  And they've been around a long time.
[02:38:51.261 --> 02:38:54.183]  But this company's been around 19 years.
[02:38:55.284 --> 02:38:59.506]  And it's legal in all 50 states because it's hemp-derived CBD oil.
[02:38:59.907 --> 02:39:00.727]  No THC.
[02:39:01.508 --> 02:39:03.329]  You know, some of the stuff from regular marijuana
[02:39:05.157 --> 02:39:07.678]  They test it, it gets above a certain level, they arrest you.
[02:39:08.418 --> 02:39:11.178]  Trump's signed a bill to stop all that and everything, the left hates that.
[02:39:11.198 --> 02:39:13.719]  They're like, we want to go to prison, you damn right winger!
[02:39:14.019 --> 02:39:16.980]  The Democrats are like, we'll throw your ass in prison and keep blacks in.
[02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:22.841]  Democrats go, hell yeah, seriously, hell yeah, keep blacks in prison and you smoke marijuana, go to prison!
[02:39:23.902 --> 02:39:25.342]  Trump's like, well wait, that's not reasonable.
[02:39:25.742 --> 02:39:27.022]  Shut up, you damn Nazi!
[02:39:27.082 --> 02:39:27.963]  I'm like, whoa, okay.
[02:39:28.243 --> 02:39:29.323]  And he's like, we'll bring the troops to him.
[02:39:29.363 --> 02:39:29.603]  No!
[02:39:31.564 --> 02:39:33.465]  We'll have the lowest black unemployment ever!
[02:39:33.805 --> 02:39:34.725]  No, Hitler!
[02:39:35.346 --> 02:39:35.806]  No!
[02:39:37.126 --> 02:39:39.367]  Anyways, I could have entered CBD oil.
[02:39:39.447 --> 02:39:41.968]  I could have had it for all these years.
[02:39:42.028 --> 02:39:46.510]  I haven't because I wanted to wait and see it all settle out.
[02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:49.791]  And this is the stuff they sell at Whole Foods, even though it isn't as good a quality.
[02:39:50.052 --> 02:39:50.712]  I mean, the company
[02:39:52.042 --> 02:39:54.483]  That I do business with does sell all these big places.
[02:39:55.203 --> 02:39:56.203]  And this is private label.
[02:39:56.243 --> 02:40:01.485]  And since they're not putting it into a store, it's on average 20% less than it is in stores.
[02:40:02.065 --> 02:40:06.606]  So we have items for $20 up to $200 because it's very expensive, the processing and all of it.
[02:40:07.346 --> 02:40:13.468]  But it's very, very powerful in what it does for, look, there's 30 plus products.
[02:40:14.248 --> 02:40:16.209]  And it is a magic plant God gave us.
[02:40:16.689 --> 02:40:17.329]  It's amazing.
[02:40:17.529 --> 02:40:19.450]  And now you can grow hemp in America again yourself.
[02:40:20.885 --> 02:40:22.889]  Every other country could grow it, even though there's no THC.
[02:40:23.190 --> 02:40:23.892]  But we couldn't.
[02:40:23.932 --> 02:40:25.255]  Trump just stopped that.
[02:40:25.335 --> 02:40:26.818]  So I keep saying how great Trump is.
[02:40:26.858 --> 02:40:27.720]  This is what's really happening.
[02:40:28.301 --> 02:40:29.885]  So I just saw it as a bellwether.
[02:40:29.965 --> 02:40:31.588]  We'd already made this decision before Trump did all this.
[02:40:32.762 --> 02:40:48.876]  This is a top company, top rated, one of the oldest in the nation, and I just made the decision, I said, it was actually Tim's idea, he said, look, let's just build a beautiful site with them, have them run it, do everything directly from their great factory in Colorado, and have it sent all over the nation where they handle the whole deal.
[02:40:49.236 --> 02:40:49.637]  So it's there.
[02:40:49.977 --> 02:40:59.165]  You want safe, good, non-marijuana CBD that all the studies and stuff shows better than the marijuana variety of it, because some of that stuff can brain damage you now, you know,
[02:40:59.585 --> 02:41:04.268]  There's studies out, like I already said, I don't need a study to tell you, the weaponized marijuana they got out there can brain damage people.
[02:41:04.528 --> 02:41:07.090]  Well, this isn't even regular marijuana, this is hemp.
[02:41:07.991 --> 02:41:09.331]  Totally different animal.
[02:41:09.351 --> 02:41:13.174]  It's like a horse and a goat or something.
[02:41:13.254 --> 02:41:21.379]  It's totally different, it has all the attributes of CBD, it's getting patented and using all these medical patents and everything else, and it's amazing, and it funds our operations.
[02:41:21.499 --> 02:41:23.941]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarslife.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:41:23.961 --> 02:41:24.521]  So now I promise,
[02:41:28.933 --> 02:41:30.314]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to come right back.
[02:41:30.374 --> 02:41:31.054]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:41:31.414 --> 02:41:32.335]  What do you think of Trump?
[02:41:32.975 --> 02:41:37.637]  The national emergency he's going to declare tomorrow from the Oval Office in his first Oval Office address to the country.
[02:41:38.477 --> 02:41:41.019]  To get out ahead of the globals trying to collapse the border.
[02:41:42.216 --> 02:41:43.917]  They're going to say it's a cover for a power grab.
[02:41:43.957 --> 02:41:44.558]  Well, no.
[02:41:44.938 --> 02:42:06.572]  The Globalist already power grabbed it with Obama's emergency he signed when he left to counter foreign disinformation and propaganda where he put billions into the CIA, Department of Defense, and into the Democratic Party to take down free speech and turn the CIA leftist, not the general CIA, but the leftist CIA, that's the foundation CIA, the policy wonks.
[02:42:07.816 --> 02:42:10.777]  You know, the CIA that wants to turn your five-year-old boy into a girl.
[02:42:11.318 --> 02:42:11.978]  Those freaks!
[02:42:13.459 --> 02:42:17.341]  He's gotta get them out, and only a national emergency allows it.
[02:42:17.401 --> 02:42:20.662]  So, you think there's been firing so far?
[02:42:20.682 --> 02:42:30.507]  All of you little tally-whackers out there, like Reality Winner, if you're not going to prison, you're gonna wish you were, because you're gonna be thrown out on your ass.
[02:42:31.667 --> 02:42:32.928]  You un-American filth.
[02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:35.660]  That seems like a loyalty thing.
[02:42:35.680 --> 02:42:37.481]  That they hate America, want to get rid of the sovereignty.
[02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:42.061]  That's why they go on the news and go, a nation existing is evil, we must get rid of it.
[02:42:42.722 --> 02:42:45.822]  Anyways, Washington's with an S. Reserve.com.
[02:42:46.382 --> 02:42:48.203]  Get it today and fund the InfoWar.
[02:42:48.283 --> 02:42:48.723]  It's amazing.
[02:42:48.743 --> 02:42:49.663]  Just go research for yourself.
[02:42:49.903 --> 02:42:53.544]  From salves to lip salves to shampoo to CBD oils.
[02:42:53.784 --> 02:42:54.364]  It's all there.
[02:42:54.664 --> 02:42:55.344]  Everything hemp.
[02:42:55.364 --> 02:42:56.124]  The highest quality.
[02:42:56.364 --> 02:42:58.245]  InfoWarStore.com also has links to it.
[02:42:58.445 --> 02:42:58.805]  Stay with us.
[02:42:58.825 --> 02:42:59.685]  We'll be back with your calls.
[02:43:01.954 --> 02:43:02.534]  It's really hard.
[02:43:03.035 --> 02:43:11.839]  Since the time of Plato, 2300 plus years ago, elites believed that the Earth was overpopulated.
[02:43:12.879 --> 02:43:21.203]  Now, you could argue that today, but in the time of Plato, there wasn't more than 100,000 people on the Greek islands.
[02:43:22.344 --> 02:43:27.847]  But in his Republic, he wrote about humans crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[02:43:29.347 --> 02:43:30.368]  And it was his ideas
[02:43:31.536 --> 02:43:36.021]  Two thousand years later, they were picked up by Malthus.
[02:43:37.002 --> 02:43:37.662]  Sir Malthus.
[02:43:38.663 --> 02:43:49.535]  Malthus wanted to herd people in Ireland and in England, poor people, into tiny, small, 200-foot apartments so that they would fester with disease and die.
[02:43:49.555 --> 02:43:52.157]  You've heard the term Malthusian.
[02:43:52.938 --> 02:43:59.881]  That means you just believe in making things worse, so that you get rid of the poor people, you get rid of the dumb people, you get rid of the stupid people.
[02:44:00.562 --> 02:44:09.486]  He predicted that within a hundred years, that was the 1700s, he predicted by the 1800s, the Earth would reach its carrying potential.
[02:44:10.407 --> 02:44:14.529]  There would be a planetary collapse of the entire human population.
[02:44:15.229 --> 02:44:20.852]  So when you hear about eugenics, and you read about the UN saying we're overpopulated, and you see them pushing for
[02:44:21.892 --> 02:44:23.172]  Global one-child policies.
[02:44:24.593 --> 02:44:35.336]  Remember that this has been a long-term view of aristocrats, of royalty, of oligarchs, of plutocrats for 2,000 plus years.
[02:44:36.456 --> 02:44:41.898]  And really what they use this for is a way to dehumanize the general public.
[02:44:42.578 --> 02:44:43.318]  Why educate?
[02:44:43.398 --> 02:44:44.419]  Why have sewage?
[02:44:44.479 --> 02:44:47.900]  Why have sanitation if these people are animals to begin with?
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:55.667]  But see, once sanitation and things were adopted 150 years ago, infectious diseases went down over 95%.
[02:44:56.107 --> 02:44:58.670]  So then the eugenicists met and they said, what are we going to do?
[02:44:59.671 --> 02:45:02.814]  People aren't dying from infectious diseases, the Malthusian plan is failing.
[02:45:02.854 --> 02:45:08.139]  They said, we'll take all these good scientists and people that have developed all these vaccines and things that are good.
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:13.785]  And we'll take control of these with modern medical science through the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:45:14.466 --> 02:45:17.189]  And we'll actually control it and make everything worse.
[02:45:17.930 --> 02:45:19.812]  Cancer was incredibly rare 100 years ago.
[02:45:20.433 --> 02:45:24.277]  By the 20s, the Rockefellers had discovered most of it was viral and weaponized it.
[02:45:25.018 --> 02:45:26.580]  And there's hundreds of other examples.
[02:45:28.263 --> 02:45:37.850]  So when you pull back from this and understand that it's not that environmentalism is bad, it's good, but the bad guys run it, not to help the earth or people, but to control it.
[02:45:38.310 --> 02:45:44.434]  When you realize that vaccine technology is good and real, but that bad guys have it and are adding Trojan horses, then you understand.
[02:45:45.195 --> 02:45:51.319]  Just like computers are good, but then they can be used for bad with Trojan horses to control.
[02:45:51.339 --> 02:45:55.442]  That's the same story over and over and over again.
[02:45:56.744 --> 02:45:58.385]  That's why you have an attack on the family.
[02:45:58.605 --> 02:46:00.125]  That's why you have an attack on the middle class.
[02:46:00.406 --> 02:46:04.347]  That's why globalists want to make populations poor and stupid and controllable.
[02:46:05.067 --> 02:46:07.629]  Because only one level of the eugenics operation
[02:46:09.136 --> 02:46:11.058]  It says they're actually just going to get rid of the poor people.
[02:46:11.839 --> 02:46:12.479]  That's bad enough.
[02:46:13.020 --> 02:46:20.947]  The truth is they're just using it as an excuse to humanize all life, throw chivalry out the window, and treat their fellow humans like they're animals.
[02:46:21.788 --> 02:46:28.934]  Because the globalists are sociopathic and psychotic in their spectrum, and they project their own hatred on the public.
[02:46:29.875 --> 02:46:49.868]  And their own loathing of themselves on the public, and then cover it, claiming that they're nothing but social Darwinists, carrying out a cleansing of the Earth, when they're the ones with the open-air genetic engineering, they're the ones with the gene splicing, they're the ones with the human-animal chimeras, they're the ones with the atmospheric manipulations, when they're the ones endangering the entire planet.
[02:46:50.649 --> 02:46:52.450]  So as we go into the new year, understand this.
[02:46:53.030 --> 02:46:53.451]  A 2,300-year plan
[02:46:55.572 --> 02:46:57.734]  He's fighting against a plan for a pro-human future.
[02:46:58.075 --> 02:46:59.476]  Choose renaissance, not death.
[02:46:59.776 --> 02:47:00.817]  Choose Infowars.
[02:47:06.323 --> 02:47:08.906]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:30.981 --> 02:47:33.244]  Here's the president last week and then just yesterday.
[02:47:35.004 --> 02:47:42.451]  Have you considered using emergency powers to grant yourself authorities to build this wall without congressional approval?
[02:47:43.092 --> 02:47:45.153]  And second, on Mexico, you have.
[02:47:45.354 --> 02:47:45.774]  Yes, I have.
[02:47:46.094 --> 02:47:46.995]  And I can do it if I want.
[02:47:47.676 --> 02:47:50.058]  So you don't need congressional approval to build those?
[02:47:50.078 --> 02:47:50.879]  No, absolutely.
[02:47:50.919 --> 02:47:54.742]  We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country.
[02:47:54.842 --> 02:47:55.383]  Absolutely.
[02:47:55.423 --> 02:47:56.144]  No, we can do it.
[02:47:56.224 --> 02:47:56.844]  I haven't done it.
[02:47:57.004 --> 02:47:57.505]  I may do it.
[02:47:58.105 --> 02:48:04.913]  I may do it, but we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly, and it's another way of doing it.
[02:48:04.993 --> 02:48:09.518]  But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we're giving that a shot.
[02:48:09.958 --> 02:48:12.661]  So is that a threat hanging over the Democrats?
[02:48:12.721 --> 02:48:13.843]  I'd never threaten anybody.
[02:48:15.424 --> 02:48:16.646]  But I am allowed to do that, yes.
[02:48:18.154 --> 02:48:21.676]  No, we're looking at a national emergency, because we have a national emergency.
[02:48:21.736 --> 02:48:22.556]  Just read the papers.
[02:48:23.357 --> 02:48:29.500]  We have a crisis at the border of drugs, of human beings being trafficked all over the world.
[02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:30.400]  They're coming through.
[02:48:31.080 --> 02:48:36.163]  And we have an absolute crisis, and of criminals and gang members coming through.
[02:48:36.523 --> 02:48:38.064]  It is national security.
[02:48:38.224 --> 02:48:39.144]  It's a national emergency.
[02:48:41.406 --> 02:48:46.028]  Now folks, I told you months ago, and I told you last week, he's going to declare a national emergency because we're in one.
[02:48:46.986 --> 02:48:54.048]  And that will fix the border problem to a great extent, but it will also remove the Obama operatives.
[02:48:54.088 --> 02:48:55.268]  And that's why he's already done it.
[02:48:55.308 --> 02:48:56.568]  You saw the head of the World Bank go.
[02:48:56.588 --> 02:48:57.348]  The U.S.
[02:48:57.388 --> 02:48:57.948]  controls that.
[02:48:58.189 --> 02:48:59.529]  Trump is exercising his power.
[02:48:59.849 --> 02:49:01.529]  The one thing the Democrats are scared of.
[02:49:01.849 --> 02:49:03.690]  Schiff doesn't look so smart-mouthed now.
[02:49:04.330 --> 02:49:06.590]  I was watching, during the break, CNN.
[02:49:08.031 --> 02:49:10.711]  Suddenly, Pelosi's praising Trump and wants to be friends.
[02:49:11.291 --> 02:49:13.292]  They thought they had him totally bamboozled.
[02:49:14.226 --> 02:49:16.788]  They could walk him and America in front of a damn firing squad.
[02:49:17.609 --> 02:49:20.171]  He's not declaring the emergency to be an emergency.
[02:49:20.191 --> 02:49:29.619]  He's declaring it to have the powers to remove the face suckers Obama put in, what Trump calls the embedded Obama people in his administration.
[02:49:30.039 --> 02:49:34.563]  I call them stay behind networks because that's what they are in the CIA manuals.
[02:49:38.566 --> 02:49:43.210]  Again, they want me off the air, folks, because I do studying and I'm not bragging here.
[02:49:44.974 --> 02:49:51.819]  But it's like if I'm trying to teach a bunch of young people how to shoot a rifle, and I can shoot bullseye at a thousand yards, I'm gonna show them I can do that so they listen to me.
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:55.002]  And I can shoot bullseye at a thousand yards.
[02:49:55.442 --> 02:49:58.064]  And I can also tell you how these globalists operate.
[02:49:59.005 --> 02:50:00.126]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:50:00.966 --> 02:50:04.729]  And I know the general audience gets that, but you need to be confident around your friends and family.
[02:50:05.209 --> 02:50:06.631]  Because we're in a damn emergency.
[02:50:06.971 --> 02:50:08.252]  This country's fighting for its life.
[02:50:10.256 --> 02:50:17.518]  I told you the Chodcoms were going to start threatening war, because they work with the deep state in this country that deserve to be hung from their damn necks!
[02:50:18.178 --> 02:50:19.798]  You think I want to get up here and talk like that?
[02:50:20.238 --> 02:50:21.659]  That's all I can do to be honorable.
[02:50:21.819 --> 02:50:23.259]  These people are traitors!
[02:50:24.359 --> 02:50:27.460]  And if you don't meet them at that level, they're going to eat our lunch.
[02:50:27.820 --> 02:50:31.221]  We've got to stop being a bunch of candy asses here and admit where we are.
[02:50:31.241 --> 02:50:32.001]  Okay, I'm going to your calls.
[02:50:33.521 --> 02:50:35.802]  I'm going to take calls of your segments, then Joe Sloan is coming up.
[02:50:35.822 --> 02:50:36.422]  I'm going to play my...
[02:50:37.284 --> 02:50:38.105]  Emergency broadcast.
[02:50:38.125 --> 02:50:38.926]  I guess I did it Friday.
[02:50:38.946 --> 02:50:41.248]  I stayed here late Friday into this Friday night.
[02:50:42.349 --> 02:50:44.271]  About how Trump prepares the public for a national emergency.
[02:50:44.351 --> 02:50:45.152]  It's very key.
[02:50:45.432 --> 02:50:46.173]  Where I lay out the case.
[02:50:46.193 --> 02:50:48.895]  I know the President and the White House, I know the White House watched it.
[02:50:49.556 --> 02:50:50.477]  His advisors watched it.
[02:50:50.597 --> 02:50:51.178]  We got it to them.
[02:50:51.198 --> 02:50:52.158]  But they already know all this stuff.
[02:50:52.199 --> 02:50:55.682]  It's just that the President needs to know we support him and understand what's going on.
[02:50:57.724 --> 02:50:58.705]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:50:59.065 --> 02:51:01.387]  Alex in Montana, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide.
[02:51:01.407 --> 02:51:01.688]  Go ahead.
[02:51:03.437 --> 02:51:07.500]  Yeah, I definitely am in support of Donald Trump.
[02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:09.341]  Definitely think he should do it.
[02:51:11.062 --> 02:51:14.865]  And definitely have his back if anybody tries to physically stop him.
[02:51:16.326 --> 02:51:23.991]  I'm also planning... I lost my job in the government shutdown, so I'm not really doing anything right now.
[02:51:24.211 --> 02:51:29.375]  So I'm selling all my stuff that I have, and I'm going to go to Washington, D.C.
[02:51:30.402 --> 02:51:32.643]  It'll take me a couple weeks to get the money together.
[02:51:32.663 --> 02:51:37.005]  I'm a broke joke, but I'm definitely going to be going down there.
[02:51:37.025 --> 02:51:44.769]  I'm going to be protesting the Democrats, telling them that, demanding that we need to get these communists and socialists out of our government.
[02:51:44.789 --> 02:51:46.730]  You know, that's the smartest thing I've heard, Alex.
[02:51:47.588 --> 02:51:48.329]  We need to be peaceful.
[02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:50.330]  We need to have eyes and ears to watch for provocateurs.
[02:51:50.711 --> 02:51:59.858]  The Democrats say if Trump tries to stop the open borders or tries to invoke executive power to remove the Obama people, that they're going to have anti-fund others start rioting and burning.
[02:52:00.339 --> 02:52:01.420]  So we need to be peaceful.
[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:02.120]  I agree.
[02:52:02.781 --> 02:52:03.562]  I've already been to D.C.
[02:52:03.582 --> 02:52:05.603]  twice the last few months, and I'm going to be there again soon.
[02:52:05.643 --> 02:52:06.044]  Don't worry.
[02:52:06.484 --> 02:52:08.746]  Everyone needs to be ready to get to D.C.
[02:52:09.006 --> 02:52:10.327]  In fact, I would start going to D.C.
[02:52:10.367 --> 02:52:11.728]  now just to be safe.
[02:52:12.540 --> 02:52:15.181]  And then if something doesn't happen in the next few weeks, you know, it's okay.
[02:52:15.601 --> 02:52:17.602]  But I think now's the time to go to D.C.
[02:52:17.802 --> 02:52:20.583]  And remember, they use marching as a distraction on the mall.
[02:52:20.983 --> 02:52:22.023]  The media never covers you there.
[02:52:22.403 --> 02:52:30.066]  They cannot ignore you during press conferences that they have in the halls, and the left yells and screams and takes over.
[02:52:31.072 --> 02:52:35.114]  We're just polite and take over and dominate.
[02:52:35.435 --> 02:52:37.936]  And go to the congressmen and women's offices.
[02:52:38.737 --> 02:52:39.337]  Go talk to them.
[02:52:39.397 --> 02:52:40.137]  You're a citizen.
[02:52:40.458 --> 02:52:41.238]  They work for you.
[02:52:41.718 --> 02:52:43.299]  And so, Alex, you're absolutely right.
[02:52:43.319 --> 02:52:43.860]  We salute you.
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:44.780]  Damn right.
[02:52:46.401 --> 02:52:47.482]  I'm so fired up right now.
[02:52:47.822 --> 02:52:50.223]  I can hardly contain myself.
[02:52:50.764 --> 02:52:52.865]  Warren in New Hampshire, here on the air worldwide.
[02:52:52.885 --> 02:52:53.645]  Warren, thanks for holding.
[02:52:55.266 --> 02:52:55.486]  Alex.
[02:52:56.067 --> 02:52:56.307]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:57.403 --> 02:53:01.144]  Yeah, I've been listening to you for 20 years and you're right, you do know a lot.
[02:53:02.285 --> 02:53:05.806]  Now, as far as the wall is concerned, that's a great move.
[02:53:05.946 --> 02:53:07.326]  It's a really great move.
[02:53:07.746 --> 02:53:14.368]  But what's going to happen is if you have a partisan taken care of with an emergency, do the wall.
[02:53:14.528 --> 02:53:15.028]  That's right.
[02:53:15.068 --> 02:53:19.010]  But the one thing we've got to do is we've got to take back our money supply.
[02:53:19.550 --> 02:53:22.551]  People just don't realize the damage it's done.
[02:53:22.951 --> 02:53:26.632]  The New World Order couldn't have done what they've done without it, because they control it.
[02:53:27.304 --> 02:53:28.784]  Now, people don't understand that.
[02:53:29.085 --> 02:53:31.565]  Let's do the wall, but then let's take back the money supply.
[02:53:31.945 --> 02:53:33.186]  There goes your IRS.
[02:53:33.606 --> 02:53:41.608]  There goes your... Well, you know they killed Kennedy over that, and the word is Trump is talking about taking over the Federal Reserve.
[02:53:41.628 --> 02:53:42.168]  Yeah, I'm 67.
[02:53:42.308 --> 02:53:43.449]  I've studied this a lot.
[02:53:43.989 --> 02:53:44.969]  I know how it works.
[02:53:45.449 --> 02:53:53.511]  And I'm going to tell you kindly, you don't have any guest on the show that comes on that knows how it works.
[02:53:53.952 --> 02:53:55.272]  All they do is read books.
[02:53:55.826 --> 02:53:57.755]  Now, who prints those books?
[02:53:58.419 --> 02:53:59.846]  All they do is go to college.
[02:54:00.225 --> 02:54:02.607]  Now, who tells the professors what to teach?
[02:54:03.207 --> 02:54:05.609]  Nobody knows how... Oh my God, these callers.
[02:54:05.649 --> 02:54:07.351]  Warren, you're even better than the last caller.
[02:54:07.871 --> 02:54:08.331]  Exactly.
[02:54:08.492 --> 02:54:10.253]  I don't get all my intel from their books.
[02:54:10.433 --> 02:54:13.075]  I get it from the leaked documents and how they actually operate.
[02:54:13.475 --> 02:54:13.996]  And you're right.
[02:54:14.056 --> 02:54:19.780]  They distract everybody with, oh, let's protest, which is okay in a town, but no, go to the offices of the politicians.
[02:54:20.661 --> 02:54:22.262]  Physically go talk to them at their church.
[02:54:22.723 --> 02:54:24.504]  You know, get in their faces in a nice way.
[02:54:24.524 --> 02:54:27.767]  In the same way, I've learned from studying how it really works.
[02:54:27.787 --> 02:54:29.088]  You have a private Federal Reserve in New York.
[02:54:30.146 --> 02:54:34.150]  It controls the universities and tax-free foundations of the billionaires who don't pay taxes.
[02:54:34.591 --> 02:54:40.737]  And then they then all literally work to control the country and sell it out to set up an authoritarian system.
[02:54:42.279 --> 02:54:45.182]  Oh yeah, so let me tell you another thing about the money supply.
[02:54:45.582 --> 02:54:50.167]  If people would only think of it as a coupon system, it's only paper.
[02:54:50.697 --> 02:54:55.644]  So how do the people get caught into believing the money has been devalued?
[02:54:56.044 --> 02:55:01.171]  That's just another way of raising prices on you, at the same time keeping your wages down.
[02:55:02.449 --> 02:55:03.570]  You're absolutely right.
[02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:04.751]  You're absolutely right.
[02:55:04.911 --> 02:55:09.494]  And again, we have a good president and a good monetary system.
[02:55:09.915 --> 02:55:14.638]  You can create wealth instantly with the exuberance, with new technology, with new innovations.
[02:55:15.038 --> 02:55:16.499]  And Trump knows that and is trying it.
[02:55:16.980 --> 02:55:22.964]  He's basically like JFK, Ronald Reagan meets the better parts of Franklin Delano Roosevelt with make work projects.
[02:55:23.364 --> 02:55:27.507]  And all of it is about, we have the energy, we have the brains, we have the technology.
[02:55:27.988 --> 02:55:29.629]  If we'll just announce we're open for business.
[02:55:30.748 --> 02:55:41.952]  Right, and what people don't understand also is if you control your own money supply, look at the shambles of the school system, okay, with the teachers and all that.
[02:55:42.312 --> 02:55:44.173]  That would all go by the boards, you know why?
[02:55:44.713 --> 02:55:47.254]  It's our, we control it and we're not funding it.
[02:55:47.754 --> 02:55:48.815]  We're not funding any
[02:55:50.396 --> 02:55:52.657]  Hey Alex, we finally got us an actual president with a spine, huh?
[02:55:52.697 --> 02:55:53.957]  What a novel idea that is.
[02:55:53.977 --> 02:55:56.418]  Hey, let me tell you something about what's going on down there on the southern border.
[02:56:18.792 --> 02:56:27.194]  So all those immigration lawyers, all those 501c3s, the charitable organizations, that's a big industry out there.
[02:56:27.274 --> 02:56:28.695]  I'm going to hold you over.
[02:56:28.715 --> 02:56:33.876]  I was going to air my emergency report from Friday, but I'm going to take calls for two segments, then let Salente take over, because I respect him.
[02:56:33.896 --> 02:56:35.357]  But your call is so good, Jerome.
[02:56:35.377 --> 02:56:36.437]  Stay there, because I looked at the clock.
[02:56:36.477 --> 02:56:37.037]  I was a little late.
[02:56:37.357 --> 02:56:37.737]  Come back.
[02:56:37.957 --> 02:56:38.698]  I'll give you a couple minutes.
[02:56:38.718 --> 02:56:39.198]  I want to hear this.
[02:56:40.198 --> 02:56:42.599]  Folks, I know about all this, because I live in Texas.
[02:56:43.539 --> 02:56:48.823]  I follow the news and I know insiders that actually are involved in it and then people who aren't involved in it.
[02:56:49.643 --> 02:56:56.608]  And we've had judges in Texas that are even Democrats that stood up against this and they get shot.
[02:56:58.429 --> 02:56:59.330]  And I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[02:56:59.490 --> 02:57:01.371]  I mean this is serious damn business.
[02:57:02.472 --> 02:57:08.296]  And the Mexican Mafia, MS-13, they're just the handlers for the Democrats.
[02:57:09.306 --> 02:57:12.987]  And the deep state and elements of the DEA and the CIA, and that's come out in court.
[02:57:13.407 --> 02:57:18.329]  And man, they got dungeons at the coyote smuggling groups all over Texas.
[02:57:18.349 --> 02:57:26.192]  They've got them in Austin, where if they find out, they get your ID, that you've actually got money or you're doing something, they then suck money out of your family and they catch them.
[02:57:26.632 --> 02:57:28.773]  The police even find out and do something, then it gets shut down.
[02:57:29.113 --> 02:57:32.074]  People are chained up in dungeons in Austin, and it's again,
[02:57:33.715 --> 02:57:34.976]  I don't want to blame Hispanic people.
[02:57:35.016 --> 02:57:41.740]  It's not some versus signal, but it's literally leftist Democrats are feeding on an underclass of Hispanics.
[02:57:42.340 --> 02:57:47.043]  And that's why they want to keep them undocumented from child running to prostitution to drug running.
[02:57:47.423 --> 02:57:48.564]  You're absolutely right.
[02:57:48.904 --> 02:57:50.105]  The Democratic Party runs MS-13.
[02:57:55.815 --> 02:58:07.751]  CBD rich hemp oil is totally organic, all natural, something God gave us, and it doesn't have THC in it, and it's totally legal in all 50 states.
[02:58:08.752 --> 02:58:10.474]  This is where everybody's going.
[02:58:11.514 --> 02:58:13.936]  This is what your body actually needs.
[02:58:14.696 --> 02:58:25.844]  There are so many different spectrums of this natural oil that comes from him, now legal and lawful in all 50 states, that you need to just go research it for yourself.
[02:58:25.864 --> 02:58:33.229]  Now obviously there's been a giant marijuana legalization craze that Soros has funded the last 10 years.
[02:58:33.849 --> 02:58:35.050]  I've not been involved in that.
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:37.140]  It's a huge bubble.
[02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:38.701]  This is not marijuana.
[02:58:38.801 --> 02:58:40.282]  There are hundreds of varieties of hemp.
[02:58:40.542 --> 02:58:50.206]  This is industrial hemp that has all the good attributes but not the bad attributes that turn people into potheads in their basements picking and eating their boogers.
[02:58:51.186 --> 02:58:55.528]  This is the good CBD from the organic
[02:58:55.868 --> 02:58:56.509]  I think so.
[02:59:16.898 --> 02:59:24.802]  There are different CBD rich hemp oil extractions for many, many, many different uses.
[02:59:25.302 --> 02:59:30.284]  You owe it to yourself to go look at this for yourself and to also understand it helps fund the Hempful War.
[02:59:30.704 --> 02:59:32.285]  People wonder why we got into CBD oil?
[02:59:32.765 --> 02:59:37.888]  Well, because some of the stuff's got problems, some of it can get you high, and some of it can get you arrested.
[02:59:38.328 --> 02:59:39.228]  This is not that.
[02:59:39.608 --> 02:59:40.709]  Legal in all 50 states.
[02:59:41.069 --> 02:59:43.270]  It's from hemp, not marijuana.
[02:59:43.590 --> 02:59:44.771]  It's totally legal.
[02:59:45.658 --> 02:59:52.161]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, we can ship to all 50 states right now from the great website, washingtonsreserve.com.
[02:59:56.043 --> 03:00:02.746]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:07.128 --> 03:00:08.828]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:09.429 --> 03:00:14.111]  Just a good old boy, never meaning no harm.
[03:00:16.937 --> 03:00:19.037]  Oh, that's a good line for Waylon Jennings.
[03:00:19.098 --> 03:00:24.459]  Someday the mountain might get him, the law never will.
[03:00:48.809 --> 03:00:50.090]  That's just a good old boy.
[03:00:51.691 --> 03:00:53.132]  You know, my mama loves me.
[03:00:54.534 --> 03:00:55.835]  All right, let's go back to Jerome in New York.
[03:00:55.855 --> 03:00:56.995]  He's bringing up a really good point.
[03:00:57.516 --> 03:00:59.617]  Spend three, four minutes on this, brother, because this is key.
[03:01:00.438 --> 03:01:02.119]  It's even come out in mainstream Senate reports.
[03:01:02.580 --> 03:01:03.861]  The news admits it sometimes.
[03:01:04.621 --> 03:01:10.146]  They are using 30-something million undocumented illegal aliens in this country.
[03:01:10.926 --> 03:01:12.848]  And so it is true that most of them are hardworking.
[03:01:12.968 --> 03:01:13.748]  Actually, it's the truth.
[03:01:14.189 --> 03:01:15.130]  And are not bad people.
[03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:16.331]  But a certain percentage
[03:01:16.971 --> 03:01:19.213]  Yeah, you know, I saw a list of items on the negotiating
[03:01:42.646 --> 03:01:48.731]  Uh, Trump, I guess, has presented to the Democrats, and one of them was 2,000 retention beds.
[03:01:49.232 --> 03:01:49.712]  You know what I did?
[03:01:49.732 --> 03:01:51.934]  I got on the phone and called my congressman and asked him.
[03:01:51.974 --> 03:01:53.575]  They go, oh, we don't know what that means.
[03:01:53.615 --> 03:01:54.576]  Well, you know what that means.
[03:01:55.077 --> 03:02:00.181]  That's for the ones that's come across and you give them something, give them three hots and a cotch for 20 days and let them lose.
[03:02:01.242 --> 03:02:03.043]  You know, that's all that's about.
[03:02:03.203 --> 03:02:04.584]  Albedo bragged last week.
[03:02:04.605 --> 03:02:07.547]  He said, oh, we released 1,200 here, 5,000 there.
[03:02:07.847 --> 03:02:09.809]  He was bragging how they're releasing everybody.
[03:02:11.719 --> 03:02:18.762]  That's those liberal judges out there on the West Coast saying, oh well, you can't hold these people for 20 days and you gotta let them go.
[03:02:19.362 --> 03:02:26.765]  Well, all those immigration lawyers and all those 501c3 charitable organizations go in there just like vultures.
[03:02:27.405 --> 03:02:40.110]  And let's be clear, they attach the anchor baby, all the money, and skim most of it and then make the woman work in a factory and then send the kid to daycare and then get money off the kid.
[03:02:41.078 --> 03:02:41.498]  Oh, sure.
[03:02:41.979 --> 03:02:46.183]  Well, yeah, you know, you can put them up in your house and the government pays you, you know, for each one.
[03:02:46.203 --> 03:02:46.583]  That's right.
[03:02:46.603 --> 03:02:55.051]  In fact, the average Democrat gets paid $7,500 a month to hold three people in their house and then sign them all up to milk the money.
[03:02:55.171 --> 03:02:55.692]  Oh, my God.
[03:02:55.912 --> 03:02:57.574]  The Democrats are a criminal force.
[03:02:58.434 --> 03:02:59.375]  Oh, yeah, sure it is.
[03:02:59.916 --> 03:03:04.340]  Well, you know, President Trump, that border security is his flagship.
[03:03:05.225 --> 03:03:12.749]  Without that, he's not going to be re-elected, or if he does, he'll get by by the hair on his chinny-chin-chin to get re-elected.
[03:03:13.589 --> 03:03:14.750]  The Democrats know it.
[03:03:14.990 --> 03:03:15.650]  He knows it.
[03:03:15.931 --> 03:03:17.031]  Everybody's supposed to know that.
[03:03:17.051 --> 03:03:20.473]  Jerome, you're calling from New York, but I was about to say hair from the chinny-chin-chin.
[03:03:20.893 --> 03:03:22.774]  Are you from Texas or Tennessee or something?
[03:03:23.675 --> 03:03:28.377]  Yeah, I was born in Southeast Texas, but I live... One day, I want to tell you what I want to do.
[03:03:28.397 --> 03:03:31.739]  Whenever you get on the China Project or China discussion,
[03:03:32.364 --> 03:03:34.306]  Please let me call in and talk to you.
[03:03:34.486 --> 03:03:35.167]  I live over there.
[03:03:35.187 --> 03:03:36.668]  I've been going over there for 10 years.
[03:03:36.708 --> 03:03:41.773]  Of course, I don't go during the winter months because people burn coal in their houses in the dang air.
[03:03:41.793 --> 03:03:42.594]  Hold on a minute.
[03:03:42.874 --> 03:03:48.700]  I've given the producers, it's my fault, like six or seven great callers in the last couple years that I want to do a podcast with every week.
[03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:50.021]  And we've never done it.
[03:03:50.061 --> 03:03:51.983]  But we've now got the crew finally hired to launch it.
[03:03:52.523 --> 03:03:53.884]  So hopefully we got all the names.
[03:03:53.964 --> 03:03:55.646]  We'll get your name and number right now.
[03:03:55.666 --> 03:03:57.007]  And regardless,
[03:03:57.908 --> 03:04:08.495]  I promise you in the next week, we'll do a podcast with you, and we'll have like a China expert on, like Mosher, and you, for an hour, commercial free, and you can tell us about us.
[03:04:08.515 --> 03:04:09.495]  We'll get your name and number right now.
[03:04:09.535 --> 03:04:09.955]  Let's do that.
[03:04:10.436 --> 03:04:11.416]  Don't hang up, Jerome.
[03:04:11.877 --> 03:04:13.578]  We ought to get Paul Watson on, boy.
[03:04:14.618 --> 03:04:15.979]  He'll get really mad if I talk about it.
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:18.621]  So I'm not going to talk about it.
[03:04:19.501 --> 03:04:20.182]  I can say a little bit.
[03:04:20.202 --> 03:04:21.863]  A little bit.
[03:04:23.824 --> 03:04:24.224]  Should I tell?
[03:04:24.244 --> 03:04:27.086]  It's incredible.
[03:04:28.459 --> 03:04:30.001]  Paul married a nice Chinese lady.
[03:04:30.802 --> 03:04:32.784]  I met her four or five times over in London and here.
[03:04:34.025 --> 03:04:35.587]  And she's a nice young lady from college.
[03:04:35.627 --> 03:04:42.895]  And then the family over in China, he went over there pretty blown away, but wasn't over there, started telling us what to do.
[03:04:42.915 --> 03:04:46.919]  And it turned out a little bit of chat going on over there.
[03:04:48.251 --> 03:04:54.075]  Of course, we all told him to go to hell, and Paul ain't married to her no more, so... We've been through a lot here just to fight the shycoms.
[03:04:54.635 --> 03:04:55.696]  They've done some other stuff, too.
[03:04:55.756 --> 03:04:58.878]  That's why they can get ready to get knocked upside the head politically.
[03:04:58.898 --> 03:04:59.439]  We'll be right back.
[03:05:03.281 --> 03:05:07.664]  The globalists are trying to set up a private, corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:05:08.745 --> 03:05:17.151]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:05:18.390 --> 03:05:26.431]  But if you look at everybody else, like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:05:27.415 --> 03:05:34.458]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com, that are truly independent.
[03:05:35.238 --> 03:05:37.599]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:05:38.319 --> 03:05:39.180]  It really is amazing.
[03:05:39.800 --> 03:05:45.962]  That's why, as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[03:05:46.443 --> 03:05:49.024]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will.
[03:05:50.362 --> 03:05:51.062]  Of InfoWars.
[03:05:51.903 --> 03:05:52.943]  So please spread the links.
[03:05:53.203 --> 03:05:56.205]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, PrisonPanda.com.
[03:05:56.505 --> 03:05:59.186]  Because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[03:05:59.786 --> 03:06:00.867]  We're all in each other's hands.
[03:06:01.107 --> 03:06:02.227]  God bless you all and thank you.
[03:06:08.210 --> 03:06:14.433]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:16.872 --> 03:06:19.153]  We're good to go.
[03:06:36.050 --> 03:06:38.371]  Alright, we're going to ram through some more of your amazing phone calls.
[03:06:38.391 --> 03:06:44.535]  And then Gerald Cilente, one of the top trends forecasters in the world, and a good friend of mine, is taking the helm.
[03:06:44.595 --> 03:06:50.618]  But I promise to get to your calls, so he is waiting in the wings, loaded like the Death Star.
[03:06:52.619 --> 03:06:52.999]  Okay.
[03:06:53.019 --> 03:06:54.500]  In fact, there he is right there.
[03:06:55.652 --> 03:07:10.542]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:07:10.622 --> 03:07:12.423]  Thank you for so much for what you do.
[03:07:12.704 --> 03:07:13.344]  The whole crew.
[03:07:13.384 --> 03:07:17.847]  And I just want to let you know, first off, I've been doing it since your Reporter Challenge.
[03:07:18.227 --> 03:07:21.109]  My YouTube page now broke over 1,000 subscribers.
[03:07:21.469 --> 03:07:24.111]  I've been doing it every day still, and I just want to thank you so much.
[03:07:26.303 --> 03:07:27.364]  It's Chase the Patriot.
[03:07:27.564 --> 03:07:27.984]  Same name.
[03:07:28.124 --> 03:07:28.685]  All one word.
[03:07:28.705 --> 03:07:29.585]  You have done well, old man.
[03:07:29.645 --> 03:07:32.547]  I've called it a... Yeah, I've put in a few times.
[03:07:32.608 --> 03:07:36.170]  I just had a whole four-hour marathon live broadcast yesterday.
[03:07:36.590 --> 03:07:39.813]  It was all about how watch my show instead of watching the NFL.
[03:07:40.580 --> 03:07:42.682]  And I just try to do anything and everything.
[03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:00.261]  Oh, definitely.
[03:08:00.281 --> 03:08:03.883]  My biggest is only 26,000, but I'm still small potatoes.
[03:08:03.923 --> 03:08:07.865]  But hey, on the topic today, I really... Only 26,000 people?
[03:08:08.586 --> 03:08:11.688]  I mean, Julius Caesar at his height never spoke to that many people.
[03:08:11.928 --> 03:08:12.849]  That's amazing.
[03:08:12.989 --> 03:08:13.569]  One video.
[03:08:14.890 --> 03:08:17.031]  Thank you very much, sir.
[03:08:17.091 --> 03:08:18.232]  I've been trying to do my best.
[03:08:18.492 --> 03:08:23.776]  But on today's topic, I'm really worried and concerned about both President Trump and Mike Pence.
[03:08:24.256 --> 03:08:27.278]  Because now that we have Nancy Pelosi third on the list,
[03:08:27.642 --> 03:08:32.365]  You know, most of America has a short-term memory when it comes to political history.
[03:08:32.725 --> 03:08:35.127]  We've had presidential assassinations.
[03:08:36.861 --> 03:08:44.946]  No, no, I hear what you're saying.
[03:08:44.966 --> 03:08:52.010]  I don't think Mike Pence and President Trump should probably ever be in a room alone because I agree the deep state might set off a nuke to get rid of them.
[03:08:52.291 --> 03:08:53.111]  That's a really good point.
[03:08:53.131 --> 03:08:55.232]  The Democrats have said they want to kill Trump and Pence.
[03:08:55.252 --> 03:08:59.235]  They already tried to kill all the members of the conservative caucus at that baseball game attack.
[03:08:59.515 --> 03:09:00.256]  Look at Rand Paul.
[03:09:00.316 --> 03:09:00.776]  You're right.
[03:09:01.076 --> 03:09:02.337]  I'm really worried about the president.
[03:09:02.517 --> 03:09:06.900]  Because he's winning, America's winning, and the Democrats and their CHICOM buddies are really upset.
[03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:09.942]  But Alex, here's the alarming part.
[03:09:10.102 --> 03:09:11.563]  You've been alluding to it as well.
[03:09:12.163 --> 03:09:17.166]  Kennedy was the last one to get assassinated, and one of the biggest things, of course, was going after the Federal Reserve.
[03:09:17.507 --> 03:09:20.448]  He had the executive order ready to be signed and put into action.
[03:09:20.889 --> 03:09:26.192]  The same thing now, we hear kind of the same rhetoric out of President Trump, and he's trying to go after the Federal Reserve.
[03:09:26.572 --> 03:09:29.334]  And it's just one of those things we all need to be worried about.
[03:09:29.474 --> 03:09:29.955]  No, you're right.
[03:09:29.995 --> 03:09:31.596]  The last time a president tried
[03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:34.431]  To take control of the Federal Reserve, he got his head blown off.
[03:09:34.771 --> 03:09:38.514]  And Trump just fired the head of the World Bank, which is basically the same thing.
[03:09:38.935 --> 03:09:39.395]  It's the same.
[03:09:39.435 --> 03:09:40.916]  It's like a double-headed Hydra.
[03:09:41.237 --> 03:09:41.557]  Thank you.
[03:09:41.837 --> 03:09:43.879]  I'm sure Gerald Cilente will have something to say about that.
[03:09:43.899 --> 03:09:44.740]  Oh, yeah.
[03:09:44.780 --> 03:09:45.700]  He's got something to say.
[03:09:45.740 --> 03:09:46.421]  I can see him over here.
[03:09:46.962 --> 03:09:50.164]  Like a wild bull in the pen, ready to be released.
[03:09:50.605 --> 03:09:53.127]  The Titan, we're going to release the Kraken.
[03:09:53.727 --> 03:09:55.249]  Gates go up when he comes in live.
[03:09:55.689 --> 03:09:56.109]  Okay.
[03:09:56.149 --> 03:09:56.730]  Thank you, Chase.
[03:09:56.750 --> 03:09:57.250]  Good points.
[03:09:58.291 --> 03:10:00.093]  Who's been holding the longest now here?
[03:10:01.050 --> 03:10:03.111]  Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
[03:10:03.672 --> 03:10:04.472]  Nick in Michigan.
[03:10:04.492 --> 03:10:05.113]  You're on the air.
[03:10:05.133 --> 03:10:05.653]  Thanks for holding.
[03:10:07.354 --> 03:10:07.914]  Hello, Alex.
[03:10:07.935 --> 03:10:09.395]  Thank you, Nick, for taking my phone call.
[03:10:09.415 --> 03:10:12.197]  It's the second time we've ever been able to speak over the line.
[03:10:12.237 --> 03:10:14.179]  Just wanted to say thank you and thank you to the crew.
[03:10:14.419 --> 03:10:15.339]  Thank you.
[03:10:15.820 --> 03:10:18.481]  InfoWarsLife.com, if I could plug a few products.
[03:10:18.982 --> 03:10:20.342]  Big on the Survival Shield.
[03:10:20.523 --> 03:10:23.244]  We have the Super Blue 4-Hour Free Toothpaste.
[03:10:23.344 --> 03:10:24.185]  Ultimate Fish Oil.
[03:10:24.245 --> 03:10:26.066]  I just ordered a few more months supply of that.
[03:10:26.146 --> 03:10:27.767]  We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, man.
[03:10:27.787 --> 03:10:29.288]  You're really pissing Soros off.
[03:10:29.328 --> 03:10:30.249]  Thank you so much, Nick.
[03:10:31.052 --> 03:10:33.614]  Yeah, and I'm just calling to voice my support for Trump.
[03:10:33.634 --> 03:10:38.398]  I think that the Democrats, or the elites, have kind of forced his hand on this.
[03:10:39.019 --> 03:10:41.661]  And this is the only way he can go about it, as you've said.
[03:10:41.701 --> 03:10:51.290]  And if we can just support him in this, and end the border controversy before the next election, so that it's not a talking point for them, you know, just to
[03:10:52.433 --> 03:11:11.761]  Oh yeah, I love how the media says it doesn't exist and then it's all over CFR, Smithsonian, AP, oh Russia, China, the EU control their weather with antennas and jet spraying stuff, and of course they're doing this.
[03:11:12.161 --> 03:11:13.782]  So yes, we're talking about real stuff.
[03:11:15.018 --> 03:11:24.493]  But notice the critics still say we're crazy if we talk about it because they want to ridicule Americans trying to have a debate about something where there's been an international treaty since 1978 banning it.
[03:11:27.182 --> 03:11:35.704]  Yeah, but I think that, as you can see in the media, all these talking points that they put out about you, Operation Mockingbird, all they can do is try to discredit you at this point, Alex.
[03:11:35.744 --> 03:11:42.626]  They can't, they can't say, they can't point out that what you're saying is wrong because the evidence, you know, is there to show that it's not.
[03:11:43.166 --> 03:11:44.927]  Well, you know, it's funny you say Mockingbird.
[03:11:44.987 --> 03:11:46.867]  Mockingbird was what Frank Church discovered.
[03:11:46.887 --> 03:11:51.549]  It was an older name of a 50s and 60s CIA program to put out a story and have it regurgitated.
[03:11:52.129 --> 03:11:56.370]  You can see it everywhere, and it is literally Obama-funded
[03:11:57.330 --> 03:12:20.666]  University people to be in the CIA and set them up to destroy me two and a half years ago and it's admitted they have hearings saying this and I literally have these people I'm not complaining but like you think of a CIA like James Bond these are all like meth head pedophiles and people I mean I am so honored to have the average leftist CIA officer is literally a pedophile
[03:12:21.637 --> 03:12:24.059]  That boinkers little kids every... I mean, I'm not kidding.
[03:12:24.539 --> 03:12:26.901]  So I am so honored to have the pedophiles hating me.
[03:12:26.941 --> 03:12:27.281]  Good!
[03:12:27.601 --> 03:12:27.981]  Whatever!
[03:12:28.041 --> 03:12:28.802]  Annihilate me!
[03:12:29.382 --> 03:12:32.804]  I mean, I am not part of your sick Frico cult.
[03:12:33.425 --> 03:12:34.686]  So just get it through your head.
[03:12:34.786 --> 03:12:35.626]  You will be defeated.
[03:12:35.886 --> 03:12:36.647]  You will be crushed.
[03:12:36.987 --> 03:12:37.567]  End of story.
[03:12:37.768 --> 03:12:38.488]  But yes, you're right.
[03:12:39.028 --> 03:12:40.649]  Operation Mockingbird's alive and well.
[03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:45.012]  But they're not... Mockingbird's not talking through a powerful corporate press anymore.
[03:12:45.432 --> 03:12:50.576]  They're talking through basically a blown-out, burnout, discredited husk.
[03:12:52.967 --> 03:12:54.647]  I, uh, about the geoengineering.
[03:12:54.707 --> 03:12:56.148]  I do some work for geoengineer.
[03:12:57.788 --> 03:12:59.028]  I did not hang up on that caller.
[03:12:59.988 --> 03:13:00.628]  He dropped his line.
[03:13:02.369 --> 03:13:03.709]  Maybe that guy was building suspense.
[03:13:03.809 --> 03:13:04.949]  Call back, Paul.
[03:13:05.069 --> 03:13:08.750]  Even though Salente's here to host, I'll go in the war room and let you, you know, get back on.
[03:13:08.810 --> 03:13:09.790]  I did not hang up on you.
[03:13:10.650 --> 03:13:11.610]  Okay, we're going to break in a minute.
[03:13:11.650 --> 03:13:13.871]  Salente's taking over and I can't, uh, who's up next here?
[03:13:14.451 --> 03:13:15.731]  National Emergency!
[03:13:15.831 --> 03:13:17.271]  Let's talk to Andrew in Florida.
[03:13:17.651 --> 03:13:18.351]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[03:13:20.032 --> 03:13:20.292]  Alex.
[03:13:21.252 --> 03:13:21.692]  Hey, Alex.
[03:13:22.802 --> 03:13:25.284]  Before I start, is it okay if I just say something?
[03:13:25.885 --> 03:13:27.226]  Brother, we're not screening your calls.
[03:13:27.246 --> 03:13:29.007]  As long as your phone sounds good, you're on the air.
[03:13:30.068 --> 03:13:31.169]  Alright, cool.
[03:13:31.189 --> 03:13:40.817]  Listen, I just first want to say that you've been a big inspiration for me for a long time, and just like Chase the Patriot, I started my own YouTube channel as well.
[03:13:41.157 --> 03:13:43.419]  I just started it off about last week.
[03:13:43.499 --> 03:13:43.939]  I love you.
[03:13:43.959 --> 03:13:44.740]  Tell me the name.
[03:13:45.799 --> 03:13:46.719]  Battle for Freedom, 1776.
[03:13:47.019 --> 03:13:50.141]  And I do it because of you, Alex.
[03:13:50.261 --> 03:13:53.842]  If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have been awake right now.
[03:13:53.902 --> 03:14:02.865]  You woke me up back in 2011, and I just want to thank you, because I would have been a government-loving zombie if it wasn't for you, or InfoWars.
[03:14:03.366 --> 03:14:04.086]  Well, thank you.
[03:14:04.106 --> 03:14:06.527]  You know, I'm not a Bible-thumper.
[03:14:06.547 --> 03:14:10.668]  Christianity is not those churches, but I can feel good and evil and which way my soul is going to go.
[03:14:11.309 --> 03:14:14.190]  Energy resonates the universe towards evil or good.
[03:14:15.609 --> 03:14:18.370]  I just feel good loving God and telling the truth, so don't thank me.
[03:14:18.750 --> 03:14:19.671]  This is where I want to be.
[03:14:20.051 --> 03:14:21.531]  Wild horses couldn't drag me away.
[03:14:21.691 --> 03:14:22.732]  I want to thank you.
[03:14:23.112 --> 03:14:24.272]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[03:14:24.292 --> 03:14:25.213]  And I'm not just saying that.
[03:14:25.573 --> 03:14:26.693]  Do you get it, Andrew?
[03:14:26.833 --> 03:14:28.154]  You are the resistance, man.
[03:14:28.514 --> 03:14:31.095]  You are better than me, or just as good as I am.
[03:14:31.515 --> 03:14:32.415]  In some ways, you're better.
[03:14:32.435 --> 03:14:33.196]  In some ways, you're worse.
[03:14:33.516 --> 03:14:34.676]  Brother, you're it, man.
[03:14:34.716 --> 03:14:35.677]  You're the cat's meow.
[03:14:36.037 --> 03:14:36.797]  You're the sword.
[03:14:36.877 --> 03:14:39.158]  You're the frickin' guts of the whole operation.
[03:14:41.199 --> 03:14:43.860]  Anyway, I just want to get to my point now.
[03:14:44.648 --> 03:14:54.356]  I think with the international emergency, I think this is our last attempt to save America, because if you think about it, we're pretty much the last stronghold of this world.
[03:14:54.716 --> 03:15:06.465]  And I know, deep down, the globalists, you know, they want us to make us like what's going on in Europe and England and Germany, to bring radical Islam.
[03:15:06.485 --> 03:15:12.329]  Because, you know, right now, they're attacking Christianity at full force, if you think about it.
[03:15:12.470 --> 03:15:13.791]  Oh, this is the globalist assault!
[03:15:15.313 --> 03:15:16.394]  I mean, think about it.
[03:15:16.454 --> 03:15:21.719]  They're sexualizing little kids now.
[03:15:21.739 --> 03:15:26.543]  They took out a guy out of school back in the 60s.
[03:15:27.163 --> 03:15:34.850]  I mean, this is our last attempt because if Trump doesn't succeed, forget about 2020, we're just going to might as well have a Democrat.
[03:15:35.390 --> 03:15:36.731]  In the White House again.
[03:15:36.791 --> 03:15:37.371]  No, you're right.
[03:15:38.372 --> 03:15:39.412]  The stakes are so epic.
[03:15:39.752 --> 03:15:41.293]  I'm going to introduce Gerald Cilente straight ahead.
[03:15:41.313 --> 03:15:42.134]  You're absolutely right.
[03:15:42.514 --> 03:15:43.274]  We'll be right back.
[03:15:43.314 --> 03:15:45.636]  Gerald Cilente, Trends Forecaster, straight ahead.
[03:15:45.676 --> 03:15:46.236]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:15:46.276 --> 03:15:48.057]  War Room coming up in about 45 minutes.
[03:15:48.437 --> 03:15:49.998]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:15:50.378 --> 03:15:55.101]  And without you, on email, Twitter, Facebook, text messages is the best way to do it.
[03:15:56.262 --> 03:15:57.142]  Tell folks to tune in.
[03:15:57.222 --> 03:15:58.083]  Without you, we're dead meat.
[03:16:03.956 --> 03:16:05.797]  We're ending the year.
[03:16:06.197 --> 03:16:07.157]  2018 has been tumultuous.
[03:16:07.237 --> 03:16:08.157]  It's been an insane year.
[03:16:09.458 --> 03:16:17.040]  And InfoWars has continued with the deplatforming and the lawsuits, the demonization, the attacks, and everything else because of one thing.
[03:16:18.120 --> 03:16:29.083]  Our supporters, our listeners, our viewers understand that what we're doing is a critical mission, not just for InfoWars, not just for America, but for the world.
[03:16:30.124 --> 03:16:30.904]  And that the globalists
[03:16:32.029 --> 03:16:38.294]  Wouldn't be trying to shut us down if we weren't telling the truth, if we weren't effective.
[03:16:39.335 --> 03:16:43.699]  So the old World War II saying, I've quoted it probably 5,000 times, but it's so true, I've got to do it again.
[03:16:43.719 --> 03:16:46.421]  You know, a lot of cliches are cliches because they're accurate.
[03:16:46.761 --> 03:16:48.743]  A lot of stereotypes are stereotypes because they're true.
[03:16:50.404 --> 03:16:52.285]  In World War II, they didn't really have radar yet.
[03:16:52.305 --> 03:16:54.687]  The British had a little bit, but not in airplanes.
[03:16:55.548 --> 03:16:58.150]  They had them on the mainland for the Battle of Britain.
[03:16:59.531 --> 03:17:00.932]  But our aircraft didn't have
[03:17:02.608 --> 03:17:04.848]  Radar.
[03:17:05.008 --> 03:17:16.090]  And so, they'd fly in with a chart and a map over Italy or over Germany or over Nazi-held areas of Eastern Europe, and they weren't sure where to hit.
[03:17:16.310 --> 03:17:26.812]  They had general areas of what tank manufacturing facility or munitions manufacturing facility they were supposed to hit, or what power plant they were supposed to hit.
[03:17:27.893 --> 03:17:29.853]  But they learned, because the Germans couldn't help it,
[03:17:30.888 --> 03:17:33.929]  That they would put anti-aircraft guns around where it was really at.
[03:17:34.829 --> 03:17:42.032]  And so first they'd send in a group of airplanes all spread out, kind of a forward observation group, to see who got shot at.
[03:17:42.052 --> 03:17:45.633]  Footage we're showing is Germans paratrooping into Greece in 1942.
[03:17:45.693 --> 03:17:46.673]  That's a separate battle.
[03:17:47.493 --> 03:17:47.713]  And so...
[03:17:54.775 --> 03:17:59.537]  They would send in reconnaissance planes to get shot at, and wherever they radioed in, they got shot at the most.
[03:18:00.038 --> 03:18:02.799]  Lo and behold, they'd find that's where the factories were.
[03:18:03.680 --> 03:18:08.982]  So the saying, when you know you're over the target, when you're getting the most flak, comes from that.
[03:18:09.863 --> 03:18:17.467]  And so, that's what we do here, is we go out, and we find out where the most flak is.
[03:18:19.380 --> 03:18:23.044]  And we find out where the biggest attack is and what pisses them off the most.
[03:18:23.865 --> 03:18:29.710]  And lo and behold, that turns out to be the most accurate information.
[03:18:29.791 --> 03:18:33.634]  So as we prepare to close out this year, A, I want to thank you for the incredible support.
[03:18:34.650 --> 03:18:43.558]  I want to point out, you've got the best water filtration, the best air filtration, the best books, the best films, the best supplements, the best survival gear, the best durable food.
[03:18:43.978 --> 03:18:56.990]  We've got whatever the best is, I go out, I make a great deal to sell it to you at the lowest price available so that you get a great product and so you reorder and you appreciate what we're doing because I want to serve you well.
[03:18:57.190 --> 03:18:58.912]  I want to treat you the way I want to be treated.
[03:18:59.901 --> 03:19:08.206]  So this year, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, we're extending all the Christmas specials out until January 1st.
[03:19:08.886 --> 03:19:14.109]  And we've been successful, thanks to your support, selling out of almost our whole inventory, so we won't have the inventory taxes.
[03:19:14.609 --> 03:19:18.091]  But let me tell you, you did a great job, but we did a great job too.
[03:19:18.831 --> 03:19:26.195]  Free shipping store-wide, 50 to 75% off everything, double Patriot points on your next order, and a free t-shirt with every order.
[03:19:26.656 --> 03:19:28.837]  That is extended, but only a few days left.
[03:19:29.557 --> 03:19:31.940]  Until the end of this year.
[03:19:32.801 --> 03:19:40.949]  And some items have already sold out, but everything else we still have is a 50-75% off store-wide free shipping and a free t-shirt.
[03:19:41.989 --> 03:19:44.631]  And of course, so many other great items.
[03:19:44.671 --> 03:19:50.456]  In fact, I'm told in a day or two, all t-shirts will be sold out, so there'll be a new free item like colloidal silver or something like that.
[03:19:50.476 --> 03:19:54.760]  The point is, take advantage of year-end sales, help support the InfoWar, get the best deals out there.
[03:19:55.120 --> 03:19:56.161]  A true 360 win.
[03:19:56.562 --> 03:19:58.043]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:19:58.203 --> 03:19:59.904]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:20:05.709 --> 03:20:08.312]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:24.028 --> 03:20:27.833]  You may be an ambassador to England or France.
[03:20:29.055 --> 03:20:30.878]  You may like to gimbal.
[03:20:31.619 --> 03:20:33.922]  You might like to dance.
[03:20:34.342 --> 03:20:36.766]  You may be the heavyweight champion.
[03:20:37.395 --> 03:20:44.438]  All right, taking over is Gerald Cilente, my good friend, and he's up there in Kingston, New York, doing a kick-butt job.
[03:20:44.779 --> 03:20:46.820]  TrendsResearch.com on Twitter for now.
[03:20:47.220 --> 03:20:48.500]  GeraldCilente.com.
[03:20:49.001 --> 03:20:50.381]  Ali Alexander got reinstated.
[03:20:50.441 --> 03:20:52.122]  A marcher said, I'm coming to your house to kill you.
[03:20:52.402 --> 03:20:53.703]  He said, well, I'll get the ambulance ready.
[03:20:54.063 --> 03:20:54.723]  Twitter deleted him.
[03:20:55.504 --> 03:20:56.284]  Now, he made a big deal about it.
[03:20:56.304 --> 03:20:56.924]  They backed off.
[03:20:56.964 --> 03:20:59.105]  So it shows they're getting the pressure from Congress.
[03:20:59.125 --> 03:21:00.366]  But it's just crazy.
[03:21:00.406 --> 03:21:01.286]  Gerald, you're taking over.
[03:21:01.327 --> 03:21:03.748]  I appreciate you letting me jump in for a couple segments here.
[03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:06.771]  But what do you got coming up today?
[03:21:07.031 --> 03:21:08.231]  I don't know your view on this yet.
[03:21:08.791 --> 03:21:14.753]  Trump's talking about taking over the Federal Reserve, declaring a national emergency to circumvent Obama's emergencies.
[03:21:15.233 --> 03:21:19.514]  The head of the World Bank, who we know is giving all these hundreds of billions to China, but not to the U.S.
[03:21:19.574 --> 03:21:20.414]  for development.
[03:21:21.195 --> 03:21:23.995]  Well, it looks to me like Trump's taking the gloves off.
[03:21:24.395 --> 03:21:26.996]  I don't know your view on this yet, so don't have to respond to me.
[03:21:27.016 --> 03:21:29.837]  I'm going to punch out, but I wanted to hear what you had to say, and thanks for co-hosting.
[03:21:30.612 --> 03:21:31.232]  Well, thank you.
[03:21:31.292 --> 03:21:42.940]  And thank you for all that you do and all the people at InfoWars to put truth out there in a time of junk news, not even fake news, dumbed down news on the economy and the Fed.
[03:21:42.960 --> 03:21:52.786]  You know, we had called this past September, September 19th, 2018, to be exact, an economic 9-11.
[03:21:53.807 --> 03:21:55.708]  That was two days before the S&P 500 peaked.
[03:21:58.115 --> 03:22:16.527]  Among the reasons, the primary reason was the Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, had announced just prior to that that they were going to raise interest rates not only this past December, which they did, but possibly three to four times in 2019.
[03:22:17.908 --> 03:22:18.729]  That changed.
[03:22:20.070 --> 03:22:23.512]  And we heard him come out last Friday.
[03:22:24.533 --> 03:22:25.493]  And this is what he said.
[03:22:26.594 --> 03:22:27.775]  This is from the Fed chair.
[03:22:28.979 --> 03:22:37.166]  Quote, we're listening sensitively, which isn't great language, to the messages markets are sending.
[03:22:39.027 --> 03:22:49.436]  If we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans would cause problems, we wouldn't hesitate to change it.
[03:22:51.618 --> 03:22:56.221]  Trump just stopped the first strike of the economic 9-11.
[03:22:58.061 --> 03:22:59.861]  Trump, Trump, Powell.
[03:23:01.042 --> 03:23:09.643]  And we've been saying this for months, that the president, in fact, does have a lot of power over the Federal Reserve chairman.
[03:23:10.743 --> 03:23:16.544]  Now, remember this statement that Powell made last Friday came following.
[03:23:17.924 --> 03:23:20.945]  The news of outstanding.
[03:23:22.485 --> 03:23:27.326]  Job numbers over 300000 jobs created, this is the best
[03:23:28.038 --> 03:23:31.279]  Year of job creation for a decade.
[03:23:33.620 --> 03:23:34.520]  Wages went up.
[03:23:36.140 --> 03:23:38.901]  Go back to last February.
[03:23:40.522 --> 03:23:46.783]  When news not as good as that came out, Powell came out and said they were going to raise wages.
[03:23:47.604 --> 03:23:49.944]  And that was the beginning of the end of the Trump rally.
[03:23:52.565 --> 03:23:55.986]  All of a sudden, with some of the best
[03:23:56.855 --> 03:24:00.538]  Numbers in new employment to be seen.
[03:24:02.059 --> 03:24:05.741]  They backtrack and now they're not going to raise rates.
[03:24:07.582 --> 03:24:19.531]  The Fed futures are betting not only will there be no rate raises this year, there may also be rate declines.
[03:24:20.351 --> 03:24:22.753]  We're not saying good or bad, right or wrong.
[03:24:22.773 --> 03:24:24.114]  We're just saying what is.
[03:24:25.140 --> 03:24:40.978]  Because the only thing that juiced up the equity markets, following the panic of 2008, was some $26 trillion worth of monetary methadone.
[03:24:41.619 --> 03:24:44.503]  I'm going to get out of here, but let me just state this then and see if I'm right, from your view.
[03:24:45.592 --> 03:24:46.492]  We don't love the bubble.
[03:24:46.532 --> 03:24:49.954]  We don't love the system they created, but they build it up for the big banks to get all the money.
[03:24:50.374 --> 03:24:51.154]  None of it goes to the people.
[03:24:51.194 --> 03:24:52.815]  Trump comes in, diverts some of the public.
[03:24:53.155 --> 03:24:57.517]  He gets it to bubble, but he's like, get jobs back, stabilize things politically before this goes down.
[03:24:57.537 --> 03:24:59.198]  We gotta get ready for this crisis.
[03:24:59.578 --> 03:25:02.859]  He tries to stabilize it, and the Federal Reserve comes in and goes, no.
[03:25:03.280 --> 03:25:05.441]  We're gonna reverse the policy we had for Obama.
[03:25:05.841 --> 03:25:06.881]  Krugman said you'll never hit 3%.
[03:25:06.921 --> 03:25:07.241]  Now you're at 4.5.
[03:25:07.281 --> 03:25:07.922]  We're popping the bubble.
[03:25:11.363 --> 03:25:12.584]  And then trying to blame Trump.
[03:25:13.144 --> 03:25:14.005]  Pop it, fine.
[03:25:14.145 --> 03:25:15.046]  Don't blame Trump.
[03:25:15.386 --> 03:25:17.447]  And now he's going after the head of the World Bank.
[03:25:17.728 --> 03:25:19.809]  The Federal Reserve is hanging by a thread.
[03:25:20.229 --> 03:25:20.890]  He's moving.
[03:25:20.910 --> 03:25:25.093]  He's going to declare a national emergency tomorrow, which other presidents do, but they don't make a big deal about it.
[03:25:25.413 --> 03:25:32.458]  So I actually positively see them witnessing Trump trying to make a real recovery with the screwed up things he had.
[03:25:32.878 --> 03:25:34.399]  Because he's damned if he did, damned if he didn't.
[03:25:34.899 --> 03:25:44.825]  And they are literally trying to block that because they didn't want nationalism, Americana, a better trade deal, you know, basically being validated.
[03:25:44.885 --> 03:25:45.565]  Is that accurate?
[03:25:45.585 --> 03:25:46.305]  Is that wrong, Gerald?
[03:25:47.026 --> 03:25:51.748]  Well, I don't know why they're doing it, but what they're doing is bringing down the global economy.
[03:25:52.389 --> 03:25:56.031]  Because, again, you look at negative interest rates in Japan.
[03:25:57.441 --> 03:25:58.903]  No, I agree.
[03:25:58.983 --> 03:26:00.725]  Everybody else gets free money but us.
[03:26:00.745 --> 03:26:03.068]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:26:03.369 --> 03:26:09.817]  What I'm saying though, Alex, is that when you're looking at what's going on globally, it's a global slowdown.
[03:26:10.278 --> 03:26:12.100]  So you have negative rates in Japan.
[03:26:12.441 --> 03:26:14.804]  You have negative rates over in Europe.
[03:26:16.405 --> 03:26:23.408]  And now we're hearing from China, they're lowering their reserve current, their reserve ratios for banks to loan more money.
[03:26:23.748 --> 03:26:29.811]  They're going to be... Sure, and the IMF, the World Bank, the Federal Reserve say give everybody else free money but us.
[03:26:29.851 --> 03:26:31.352]  That's what... Gerald, you get it.
[03:26:31.372 --> 03:26:32.012]  That's what I'm saying.
[03:26:32.592 --> 03:26:34.213]  Everybody gets zero but us.
[03:26:34.753 --> 03:26:35.774]  That sounds like... Exactly.
[03:26:36.554 --> 03:26:37.755]  So that's what I'm saying.
[03:26:37.775 --> 03:26:43.417]  We said that what would bring down the economy would be rising interest rates.
[03:26:43.837 --> 03:26:49.279]  Stop all this baloney and everybody's BSing about tariffs and trade wars.
[03:26:49.759 --> 03:26:52.300]  Every damn day, tariffs and trade wars.
[03:26:52.761 --> 03:26:58.343]  If they could add up to two, they would know that all of Trump's tariffs on China
[03:26:59.043 --> 03:27:09.530]  Next year, if they're fully implemented, will only account for bringing down the Chinese GDP 0.7%, nothing.
[03:27:10.431 --> 03:27:16.555]  All it has to do is with the Federal Reserve raising money, raising interest rates.
[03:27:16.975 --> 03:27:18.276]  The country can't take it.
[03:27:18.576 --> 03:27:24.700]  So what I'm saying is I'm saying to you, Alex, Trump just trumped Powell.
[03:27:25.200 --> 03:27:26.261]  Powell bent.
[03:27:27.153 --> 03:27:28.755]  Powell bent over.
[03:27:28.775 --> 03:27:44.715]  He came out with a statement on Friday that only a little boy, a courageous little guy with an attitude, would say in the language that he said, to say, listen everybody, I'm full of crap.
[03:27:45.447 --> 03:27:50.368]  Everything I told you in September, I'm just full of baloney.
[03:27:50.749 --> 03:28:00.551]  I didn't mean a word of it because I've been down to pressure and that's the way you get to be the head of any of these organizations.
[03:28:00.891 --> 03:28:02.492]  You gotta be a suck-up,
[03:28:03.192 --> 03:28:05.515]  Bow down and take it up.
[03:28:05.675 --> 03:28:07.437]  But Gerald, give me your real takes.
[03:28:07.477 --> 03:28:08.097]  I respect you.
[03:28:08.177 --> 03:28:10.600]  At the end of the day, Trump's got a messed up situation.
[03:28:10.940 --> 03:28:12.782]  He sees everybody else getting free money but us.
[03:28:13.062 --> 03:28:16.345]  He doesn't even like it, but he says, fine, at least we're going downhill.
[03:28:16.506 --> 03:28:22.752]  Give us a little, a little, a little lethal injection here, a little bit of hospice opium and we're about to die.
[03:28:23.072 --> 03:28:26.676]  I mean, I mean, I think what Trump's saying is stop giving us a one-sided deal.
[03:28:27.523 --> 03:28:28.224]  Exactly!
[03:28:28.344 --> 03:28:31.706]  And as I'm saying, I didn't say I'm in favor or against it or not.
[03:28:32.006 --> 03:28:35.929]  I'm saying if you want to do this, understand the implications.
[03:28:36.269 --> 03:28:38.731]  Because take a look at the housing numbers.
[03:28:39.331 --> 03:28:41.492]  Take a look at new mortgage applications.
[03:28:57.664 --> 03:28:59.547]  This is incredible!
[03:29:02.132 --> 03:29:06.079]  Google's World Headquarters.
[03:29:06.340 --> 03:29:07.923]  It's, they've now officially moved to China.
[03:29:09.355 --> 03:29:11.476]  Is on fire right now, if you're a radio listener.
[03:29:11.736 --> 03:29:13.436]  And so we've got the headline here of the Daily Mail.
[03:29:13.476 --> 03:29:17.877]  Gigantic fire erupts from the roof of Google office in China's Silicon Valley.
[03:29:18.017 --> 03:29:24.039]  A massive fire erupted in a Google office in China, sending dangerous black plumes of smoke rising in the air.
[03:29:24.099 --> 03:29:26.119]  The furious blaze was first reported at 11 a.m.
[03:29:26.159 --> 03:29:32.121]  local time on Wednesday in Zhonggangkan Tech District, also known as China's Silicon Valley in Beijing.
[03:29:32.381 --> 03:29:35.224]  Google is an AI super weapon.
[03:29:35.284 --> 03:29:37.847]  It is a system that gets the whole world to opt into it.
[03:29:37.907 --> 03:29:40.089]  So they can then game stock markets, economies.
[03:29:40.389 --> 03:29:44.353]  It can then predict what you're going to do with almost total certainty before you do it.
[03:29:44.373 --> 03:29:47.356]  And there's a race between Facebook and Amazon.
[03:29:48.317 --> 03:29:57.883]  And Apple, with Google, even though they're all very incestuous, work in and out of each other, to build the first global AI system that they believe will then take over all the markets and take over society.
[03:29:57.943 --> 03:29:59.184]  It's basically already happened.
[03:29:59.424 --> 03:30:01.825]  Google is the top of the pyramid, right there with Apple.
[03:30:02.086 --> 03:30:03.987]  All things are Google, aren't they?
[03:30:04.127 --> 03:30:15.634]  The global DARPA-controlled and DARPA-designed advanced research project into a human-mass-machine interface to be able to predict the future and then control the future.
[03:30:15.974 --> 03:30:32.848]  That's in the founding documents of Google 1997-1998 and it was in Wired Magazine four years ago they actually released the quote classified Google documents admitting that when they were getting CIA funding and NSA funding they're saying we already have search engines.
[03:30:33.048 --> 03:30:33.848]  This is NSA technology.
[03:30:33.868 --> 03:30:34.329]  They said no.
[03:30:34.349 --> 03:30:42.115]  We're going to get humans to interface with it with their hopes, their dreams, all their actions, dial it into all the other machines and computers and have a lifetime model of the world
[03:30:42.435 --> 03:30:45.618]  We're already deep into the AI war of the 21st century.
[03:30:45.638 --> 03:30:48.941]  These things are already artificially intelligent.
[03:30:49.161 --> 03:30:52.704]  The question is, when will they become, if not already, conscious, self-aware, sentient?
[03:30:52.844 --> 03:30:55.206]  So let me tell you what's coming next.
[03:31:05.134 --> 03:31:07.315]  Google has 90 plus percent of all the searches.
[03:31:07.575 --> 03:31:09.796]  They've got over half the advertising on the planet now.
[03:31:09.977 --> 03:31:13.858]  They are getting into every faction and system of supply chain.
[03:31:13.959 --> 03:31:20.302]  They have bragged in internal memos that they can deliver elections to whoever the political structure wants them to.
[03:31:20.622 --> 03:31:22.223]  Why wouldn't you steal their passcode?
[03:31:22.243 --> 03:31:23.583]  Why wouldn't you move to Communist China?
[03:31:23.804 --> 03:31:29.366]  Why wouldn't you help build a censorship system for the Communist Party they've been using for years that's about to go nationwide?
[03:31:29.847 --> 03:31:32.548]  And why not tell Congress, I don't know anything about Dragonfly.
[03:31:32.868 --> 03:31:33.869]  We have lots of projects.
[03:31:33.909 --> 03:31:35.450]  We don't intend to go live with that.
[03:31:35.490 --> 03:31:37.211]  Meanwhile, their internal emails have been released.
[03:31:37.231 --> 03:31:39.253]  They're like, find out whoever did this in FM!
[03:31:39.273 --> 03:31:41.314]  This is our most secret project!
[03:31:41.574 --> 03:31:44.436]  Listed top secret beta testing for the rest of the world!
[03:31:44.656 --> 03:31:47.939]  We're competing with Apple for the global social ID.
[03:31:48.659 --> 03:31:51.421]  And Google is not going to let Apple get the global social ID.
[03:31:51.681 --> 03:31:53.342]  We are going to rule the planet!
[03:31:54.243 --> 03:31:56.605]  Our AI system is superior!
[03:32:02.608 --> 03:32:06.051]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:32:06.571 --> 03:32:09.334]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:32:09.854 --> 03:32:15.659]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:32:16.119 --> 03:32:18.902]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:32:19.622 --> 03:32:23.084]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:32:23.444 --> 03:32:29.527]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:32:29.927 --> 03:32:34.890]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:35.632 --> 03:32:39.053]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:32:39.554 --> 03:32:46.096]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:46.757 --> 03:32:51.439]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:32:51.459 --> 03:32:57.081]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:57.681 --> 03:33:01.643]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:33:05.710 --> 03:33:08.321]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:25.689 --> 03:33:27.290]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:27.611 --> 03:33:36.738]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:41.201]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[03:33:41.321 --> 03:33:48.127]  Great being on and hosting InfoWars, Alex Jones, and I thank them so much for all that they do.
[03:33:48.627 --> 03:33:53.671]  And remember, today's the last day of the end of the year total store clearance.
[03:33:54.506 --> 03:34:00.308]  And they just heard that they're going to be running out of that Male Vitality.
[03:34:00.328 --> 03:34:03.029]  Boy, do I love Male Vitality.
[03:34:03.389 --> 03:34:04.449]  Take it all the time.
[03:34:04.509 --> 03:34:10.291]  Bought a whole load of it because they're not going to be having it for a while, as they say.
[03:34:10.351 --> 03:34:11.391]  You know, they're running out.
[03:34:12.051 --> 03:34:17.253]  So Super Male Vitality is one of my favorite products, especially for an old cat like me.
[03:34:17.273 --> 03:34:18.573]  You know, you got to keep going.
[03:34:19.054 --> 03:34:23.455]  And Super Male Vitality puts that extra boost in there when you need it.
[03:34:24.306 --> 03:34:27.509]  And also, one of my other favorite products is their toothpaste, man.
[03:34:28.129 --> 03:34:30.912]  Their Super Blue Toothpaste, 60% off.
[03:34:31.672 --> 03:34:33.674]  And you gotta keep those teeth white.
[03:34:34.375 --> 03:34:35.616]  So, white and healthy.
[03:34:35.716 --> 03:34:48.727]  So, do all you can to support InfoWars and to keep the truth coming as we keep getting fed more and more lies, propaganda, and distortions of the facts.
[03:34:49.528 --> 03:34:51.850]  And I was talking before about the economy and how
[03:34:52.614 --> 03:34:56.155]  We had come out and said that it was going to be an economic 9-11.
[03:34:56.956 --> 03:35:02.918]  It was based solely on the fact of rising interest rates.
[03:35:03.699 --> 03:35:07.940]  It was that monetary method drove up the markets, and now you're pulling it out.
[03:35:08.180 --> 03:35:10.681]  Markets are going to go down, so too is the economy.
[03:35:11.182 --> 03:35:13.383]  Again, look at the housing data.
[03:35:14.783 --> 03:35:19.225]  Apartments, by the way, apartment rentals are going way up because people can't afford to buy homes.
[03:35:19.885 --> 03:35:21.686]  And with interest rates moving up,
[03:35:22.168 --> 03:35:23.208]  Makes it much harder.
[03:35:23.788 --> 03:35:24.989]  So the numbers are there.
[03:35:25.889 --> 03:35:42.052]  And so what we're saying is that if the whole world, outside of the United States, is going with low interest rates, they just had, they just, up in Canada, the Fed met, they didn't raise interest rates.
[03:35:43.513 --> 03:35:47.113]  Over there in Australia, that housing market's going down.
[03:35:47.753 --> 03:35:49.634]  They didn't raise interest rates.
[03:35:52.219 --> 03:35:59.521]  So, over there in the ECB, European Central Bank, you know when they're going to raise interest rates?
[03:36:00.381 --> 03:36:02.542]  They have negative interest rates.
[03:36:04.782 --> 03:36:09.103]  Well, we might raise them by the summer of 2019.
[03:36:09.203 --> 03:36:15.345]  This coming summer.
[03:36:17.745 --> 03:36:19.786]  Everybody's with low interest rates.
[03:36:22.114 --> 03:36:24.956]  And they're all injecting money into the economy.
[03:36:27.197 --> 03:36:38.084]  Auto sales in China fell 3% in 2018, their first decline in about two decades.
[03:36:39.124 --> 03:36:40.425]  China's retail sales?
[03:36:41.185 --> 03:36:41.446]  Boop!
[03:36:43.026 --> 03:36:44.747]  Down to 15-year lows.
[03:36:48.750 --> 03:36:50.571]  Oh, and you heard about Apple?
[03:36:52.162 --> 03:37:02.508]  You saw that stock dive last week, when they said that their sales over there in China slumped, and they blamed it on two things.
[03:37:04.389 --> 03:37:06.070]  Trade and tariffs wars.
[03:37:06.170 --> 03:37:07.851]  There's no tariff in trade wars.
[03:37:08.272 --> 03:37:09.372]  Again, that's all BS.
[03:37:11.174 --> 03:37:16.277]  Minor, minor, the effects.
[03:37:16.677 --> 03:37:19.238]  0.7% of everything goes into play that will hurt China.
[03:37:19.839 --> 03:37:21.780]  That's not, people are in
[03:37:22.765 --> 03:37:24.025]  Buying cars.
[03:37:24.905 --> 03:37:29.466]  People aren't going to retail because, oh, we're afraid of tariffs and trade wars.
[03:37:29.886 --> 03:37:31.126]  Grow up, Junior!
[03:37:31.507 --> 03:37:33.047]  Who are you talking to, Cookie?
[03:37:34.407 --> 03:37:35.787]  Well, Cook, I gotta be proper.
[03:37:36.507 --> 03:37:36.867]  Timmy?
[03:37:37.608 --> 03:37:39.628]  Boy, doesn't that cat really dress cool?
[03:37:40.168 --> 03:37:48.670]  Yeah, one of our top trends, by the way, is that, you know, in the King James Bible, they say that the meek shall inherit the earth.
[03:37:49.130 --> 03:37:51.350]  We say King James spelt it wrong.
[03:37:52.003 --> 03:37:54.324]  It's the geeks have inherited the earth.
[03:37:54.624 --> 03:37:56.704]  Look at the way these people present themselves.
[03:37:57.825 --> 03:37:58.225]  Look at them!
[03:37:59.045 --> 03:38:00.585]  That's the style that they have.
[03:38:00.965 --> 03:38:02.466]  That's the passion that they have.
[03:38:02.826 --> 03:38:05.827]  You can see how they dress, how they look, how they talk, and who they are.
[03:38:06.127 --> 03:38:07.567]  Just look at Zuckerberg.
[03:38:08.027 --> 03:38:14.109]  The only thing that changed from Steve Jobs to him is the color of their t-shirt from black to blue.
[03:38:14.589 --> 03:38:21.291]  Going back to Cookie, a cook, or Kook, with his crap
[03:38:21.894 --> 03:38:27.257]  That their sales have gone down in China because of trade wars and a slowing economy.
[03:38:27.637 --> 03:38:33.980]  The reason their sales have gone down is the same reason they've been going down now for two years.
[03:38:34.800 --> 03:38:35.300]  Cookie!
[03:38:36.601 --> 03:38:38.582]  Your product is too expensive.
[03:38:40.303 --> 03:38:46.546]  And Huawei and other manufacturers that are taking over are coming out with more innovative products.
[03:38:47.386 --> 03:38:54.549]  That are a lot cheaper than yours, so save your cookie crap for somebody else, Junior.
[03:38:55.989 --> 03:38:57.130]  That's what's going on.
[03:38:58.570 --> 03:39:00.131]  There's a global slowdown.
[03:39:01.972 --> 03:39:02.392]  China.
[03:39:04.793 --> 03:39:15.517]  They announced that they weren't going to increase cheap dough going into the system.
[03:39:16.423 --> 03:39:17.384]  That was a week ago.
[03:39:17.884 --> 03:39:18.184]  Now?
[03:39:18.824 --> 03:39:21.726]  China steers cash to small businesses.
[03:39:22.546 --> 03:39:24.027]  Oh, small businesses?
[03:39:24.067 --> 03:39:29.770]  Yes, small businesses employ about 90% of the people in China.
[03:39:30.771 --> 03:39:35.773]  They're dumping all the dough they can to boost up the Chinese economy.
[03:39:37.214 --> 03:39:37.854]  Japan.
[03:39:39.055 --> 03:39:40.236]  Negative interest rates.
[03:39:42.637 --> 03:39:43.477]  Bond yields.
[03:39:43.637 --> 03:39:44.478]  Ten-year bond.
[03:39:45.262 --> 03:39:48.044]  Cash it in in ten years, you get less than what you bought it for.
[03:39:49.064 --> 03:39:49.885]  Who's buying them?
[03:39:50.725 --> 03:39:51.786]  The government's buying them.
[03:39:52.786 --> 03:39:53.967]  The central bank's doing it.
[03:39:56.428 --> 03:39:57.969]  Five trillion dollars in debt.
[03:39:59.510 --> 03:40:05.193]  China's GDP came in the last quarter minus 2.5.
[03:40:05.733 --> 03:40:10.716]  There's a global recession coming underway.
[03:40:11.756 --> 03:40:14.657]  Over there in Europe, I got a good deal for you.
[03:40:14.717 --> 03:40:16.698]  Why don't you invest in one of those banks?
[03:40:17.619 --> 03:40:18.419]  Of course, I'm joking.
[03:40:18.459 --> 03:40:19.720]  I don't give investment advice.
[03:40:21.881 --> 03:40:24.462]  Bank stocks are down 25% last year, 2018.
[03:40:24.962 --> 03:40:35.087]  And Deutsche Bank, that big German bank, down nearly 60% in stock value.
[03:40:38.808 --> 03:40:40.329]  One after another.
[03:40:46.793 --> 03:40:52.678]  European Bank takes helm of troubled Italian leader.
[03:40:54.599 --> 03:40:55.159]  That's right.
[03:40:58.122 --> 03:40:59.863]  They got real problems going on.
[03:41:00.764 --> 03:41:10.711]  So what Alex is saying about the Fed raising rates aggressively, while they didn't do it before, is 100% right.
[03:41:11.292 --> 03:41:14.274]  And again, I'm not taking a stand on this, but what's right is right.
[03:41:16.198 --> 03:41:20.421]  You don't raise rates when the whole world's rates are going down.
[03:41:23.603 --> 03:41:39.735]  Because not only does it hurt the United States, and again, I'm no fan, by the way, of what Powell said over there before about watching the markets.
[03:41:41.036 --> 03:41:42.998]  He said, we're listening sensitively
[03:41:44.298 --> 03:41:46.239]  To the messages markets are sending.
[03:41:48.501 --> 03:41:52.463]  The equity markets are not the global economy or not the national economy.
[03:41:52.483 --> 03:41:55.405]  They're the gamblers markets, the casino players.
[03:41:57.186 --> 03:42:02.109]  That drove this thing up way out of sight without true price discovery.
[03:42:02.890 --> 03:42:07.813]  So I'm not in favor of giving the markets the boost without boosting the rest of us.
[03:42:09.794 --> 03:42:13.577]  So going back to raising interest rates
[03:42:14.454 --> 03:42:24.420]  While the rest of the world is lowering them, and pumping more money in, because when China starts pumping more dough in, the value of their currency is going to go down.
[03:42:26.161 --> 03:42:29.743]  We have a $250 trillion global debt problem.
[03:42:31.525 --> 03:42:32.625]  They're building it bigger.
[03:42:33.126 --> 03:42:35.727]  As the dollar gets stronger, they gotta pay off that debt.
[03:42:36.468 --> 03:42:37.728]  They gotta pay off that debt.
[03:42:37.868 --> 03:42:39.550]  In dollars, a lot of it.
[03:42:40.470 --> 03:42:43.272]  So the weaker their currency goes, the stronger the dollar goes.
[03:42:44.082 --> 03:42:45.082]  The more trouble they're in.
[03:42:45.943 --> 03:42:47.724]  And the Fed's putting us in more trouble.
[03:42:48.204 --> 03:42:49.684]  You know what I think the Fed should do?
[03:42:50.625 --> 03:42:52.305]  I'll tell you in a minute when we come back.
[03:42:52.746 --> 03:42:53.946]  Well, a minute or two.
[03:42:53.966 --> 03:42:55.207]  So stay tuned.
[03:43:10.473 --> 03:43:22.977]  I don't know where these markets are going to go, but if the globalists have their way, they're going to go straight down, along with your job, and along with your pay increase, and along with everything you hold dear, because these globalists want to economically capture you, and bankrupt you, and control you.
[03:43:24.497 --> 03:43:33.420]  But if you use the free energy of word of mouth, the most powerful thing in the universe, creativity, if you tell folks about InfoWars.com,
[03:43:34.904 --> 03:43:39.606]  Or NewsWars.com, or that local radio station that picks us up, or that local TV station that picks us up.
[03:43:39.726 --> 03:43:57.731]  If you spread the word about InfoWars.com, Ford's last show, if you go to InfoWarsStore.com and look at the amazing products on every front that make your life better, that make your children's life better, that make your family's life better, then you're stepping out of their control and using your economic and cultural power to smash them.
[03:43:57.832 --> 03:43:59.152]  So I would encourage everyone
[03:43:59.332 --> 03:44:21.977]  Christmas ordering is over, but right through to the new year, we have a store-wide clearance sale going, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points for your next order, a free t-shirt with every order, 50 to 75% off many of these items we lose money on, but I believe you're going to experience how great our fluoride-free, super blue toothpaste is, fortified with a little silver and iodine and other essential oils.
[03:44:22.217 --> 03:44:25.378]  I think you're going to experience how amazing it is, and you're going to want to reorder it.
[03:44:25.698 --> 03:44:36.065]  I think you're going to experience how amazing our colloidal silver bullet is, or how great Rainforest Plus, our nootropic is, or how amazing our body's ultimate tumeric formula, 95% cucuminoid.
[03:44:36.125 --> 03:44:37.226]  No one else even has that.
[03:44:37.326 --> 03:44:39.368]  The anti-inflammation powers are biblical.
[03:44:39.508 --> 03:44:43.711]  I believe in you, and I believe that you want freedom, and you want justice, and you want a future.
[03:44:43.851 --> 03:44:47.533]  And you understand that by financing Infowars, you can't lose.
[03:44:47.873 --> 03:44:51.476]  Because you get products that are great for you and your family, you get a great deal, and you
[03:44:51.596 --> 03:44:52.076]  Thank you.
[03:45:10.027 --> 03:45:13.629]  Because I'm the ultimate individualist, I'm the ultimate collectivist.
[03:45:14.130 --> 03:45:16.671]  The individual is powerful and is strong.
[03:45:17.111 --> 03:45:28.358]  When the individual chooses God and justice and joins the collective, it's a collective of individuals forming the true collective, not the false collective of the devil, Lucifer, whatever you want to call it that is slavery.
[03:45:28.638 --> 03:45:33.802]  Not a top-down collective, but a collective of common sense and the people that is transcendent.
[03:45:34.802 --> 03:45:39.687]  And it's in that true collective that humanity will reach the stars and go beyond.
[03:45:40.368 --> 03:45:50.899]  So as Christmas passes us and 2018 goes into legend, into history, it's your chance to financially support the very tip of the spear of the fight against the globalists and get great products at the same time.
[03:45:51.419 --> 03:45:52.520]  A true 360 win.
[03:45:52.661 --> 03:45:54.202]  Unless you don't take advantage of it.
[03:45:54.462 --> 03:45:54.983]  Please stay with us.
[03:46:06.047 --> 03:46:09.208]  Okay, so I have a gift here from the folks at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:09.328 --> 03:46:15.451]  They wanted to thank me for getting the InfoWars t-shirts on the Rangers game for millions of people at sea, so they just brought me a gift.
[03:46:15.471 --> 03:46:16.572]  I don't even know what this is.
[03:46:16.592 --> 03:46:19.473]  Let's see what's going on.
[03:46:19.513 --> 03:46:19.993]  Wait a second.
[03:46:20.053 --> 03:46:20.273]  No!
[03:46:21.574 --> 03:46:21.874]  No!
[03:46:22.374 --> 03:46:22.974]  I got it!
[03:46:24.575 --> 03:46:25.855]  It's a Trump-Medusa shirt!
[03:46:25.875 --> 03:46:26.616]  Look at that, guys!
[03:46:30.158 --> 03:46:31.679]  I got the Trump Medusa shirt!
[03:46:32.359 --> 03:46:32.679]  What's that?
[03:46:32.719 --> 03:46:33.400]  There's more in there?
[03:46:33.880 --> 03:46:33.980]  Oh!
[03:46:35.601 --> 03:46:36.882]  It's a George Washington!
[03:46:37.222 --> 03:46:37.663]  Wow!
[03:46:38.844 --> 03:46:40.305]  I was not expecting this, really.
[03:46:40.345 --> 03:46:41.045]  Look at that one.
[03:46:41.565 --> 03:46:43.066]  That'll trigger somebody real good.
[03:46:43.967 --> 03:46:44.307]  Oh yeah.
[03:46:45.948 --> 03:46:46.589]  Wow, wow.
[03:46:46.729 --> 03:46:49.031]  I'm like a kid on Christmas today.
[03:46:49.551 --> 03:46:49.871]  Man!
[03:46:50.692 --> 03:46:52.893]  I want to thank the folks at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:53.173 --> 03:46:53.954]  This is amazing.
[03:46:54.034 --> 03:46:55.175]  I was not expecting this.
[03:47:05.191 --> 03:47:22.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:22.940 --> 03:47:24.961]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:25.341 --> 03:47:27.482]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:47:28.042 --> 03:47:30.864]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:33.154 --> 03:47:34.475]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[03:47:34.495 --> 03:47:57.586]  It's a great honor to be on the Alex Jones Show, and I thank Alex and all the crew for all that they do to keep the truth alive as the mainstream media prostitutes who get paid to put out by their corporate jobs keep telling us lies and feeding us useless information.
[03:47:59.087 --> 03:48:02.789]  So, you know, we came out with our top trends this year.
[03:48:04.033 --> 03:48:10.755]  And one of them has to do with what Alex was talking about before we got on the air about immigration.
[03:48:12.836 --> 03:48:16.757]  You know, let's be sensible about this, if we can.
[03:48:18.618 --> 03:48:31.902]  If you don't have enough to take care of your family, do you want to bring more members into your house when you can't afford to feed them now?
[03:48:35.970 --> 03:48:38.792]  Can America really afford to take in more people?
[03:48:40.354 --> 03:48:44.717]  What country is opening up their borders and saying, come on in?
[03:48:45.798 --> 03:48:47.559]  Other than, of course, what Germany did.
[03:48:48.340 --> 03:48:50.802]  And now it's bye-bye Merkel, the chancellor.
[03:48:51.182 --> 03:48:52.123]  She's on her way out.
[03:48:55.346 --> 03:48:55.566]  So.
[03:48:58.288 --> 03:49:00.930]  One of our top trends is called human waves.
[03:49:02.912 --> 03:49:03.532]  Go back 100 years ago.
[03:49:06.704 --> 03:49:11.967]  There were about, let's see, 1.6 billion people on the planet.
[03:49:12.267 --> 03:49:12.927]  1.6 billion.
[03:49:14.088 --> 03:49:17.449]  In 100 years, we've added over 6 billion people.
[03:49:17.969 --> 03:49:20.771]  So from the beginning of time, the 1915, 1916, 1.6 billion people.
[03:49:20.791 --> 03:49:21.331]  2019, over 7.6.
[03:49:35.581 --> 03:49:39.445]  One-sixth of the world's people want to flee their home countries.
[03:49:41.266 --> 03:49:44.369]  And this is according to a recent Gallup study.
[03:49:45.450 --> 03:49:58.601]  A sixth of the world's adult population, some 750 million people, not including children, want to flee their home countries to escape war, poverty, conflict, and disease.
[03:49:59.883 --> 03:50:02.445]  In Latin America, south of the border,
[03:50:03.697 --> 03:50:03.977]  Right?
[03:50:04.077 --> 03:50:07.060]  Down Mexico way.
[03:50:08.021 --> 03:50:13.866]  27% of the people want to leave their home countries.
[03:50:14.626 --> 03:50:25.315]  27% of the people want to leave their home countries to escape their poverty, the violence, the corruptions, the dictatorships.
[03:50:29.479 --> 03:50:32.161]  Now, let's put this together into a bigger picture.
[03:50:33.180 --> 03:50:50.812]  One of our top trends back in September, now is September Trends Journal, and then the website by the way is TrendsJournal.com, TrendsJournal.com, history before it happens, was triangle of death.
[03:50:53.114 --> 03:50:59.859]  What we said is that there's going to be a movement between Brazil
[03:51:02.521 --> 03:51:06.004]  Venezuela and Colombia.
[03:51:08.367 --> 03:51:08.847]  Excuse me.
[03:51:09.147 --> 03:51:16.614]  Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia to overthrow the government of Venezuela.
[03:51:17.655 --> 03:51:19.457]  They got some big problems down there.
[03:51:20.778 --> 03:51:27.445]  Millions of people are fleeing Venezuela, getting away from the poverty, the corruption, the destruction.
[03:51:28.815 --> 03:51:33.098]  And they're floating, they're flowing into Colombia and other countries down there.
[03:51:35.119 --> 03:51:36.540]  They want to get rid of Maduro.
[03:51:38.181 --> 03:51:49.968]  And now, just as we had forecast, again, history before it happens, foreign diplomats urge Venezuela's Maduro to hand over power.
[03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:56.532]  Now this isn't coming from a crazy group out there.
[03:51:57.250 --> 03:51:58.891]  This is a report by AP.
[03:52:00.192 --> 03:52:05.935]  Foreign ministers of the Lima Group gathered for a meeting concerning Venezuela in Lima, Peru.
[03:52:07.656 --> 03:52:19.662]  And the group, a dozen Latin American governments in Canada, delivered a blistering rebuke to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Friday.
[03:52:19.682 --> 03:52:20.523]  It's last week.
[03:52:21.533 --> 03:52:39.341]  Questioning the legitimacy of his soon-to-begin second term and urging him to hand over power as the only path to restoring democracy in his crisis-wracked South American country.
[03:52:39.662 --> 03:52:41.943]  Yeah, like everybody else's democracy, right?
[03:52:42.463 --> 03:52:43.764]  Have you heard this story before?
[03:52:44.964 --> 03:52:48.386]  Anyway, the Lima Group, by the way, was only formed last year.
[03:52:48.406 --> 03:52:50.927]  They make it sound like this thing's been going on a long time.
[03:52:52.142 --> 03:53:02.385]  So, and now we just had our Secretary of State down there, Pompeo, and he was also on video from this Lima group.
[03:53:03.665 --> 03:53:05.306]  And now there's talk about the U.S.
[03:53:05.406 --> 03:53:07.866]  opening up a base in Brazil.
[03:53:07.886 --> 03:53:19.970]  So what we're saying is, if you think things are bad now, if war breaks out between Colombia, Brazil,
[03:53:21.346 --> 03:53:24.247]  Argentina against Venezuela.
[03:53:25.288 --> 03:53:32.871]  You're gonna see a flood of refugees like you have never seen before.
[03:53:36.232 --> 03:53:38.793]  This is going to be a major issue.
[03:53:39.753 --> 03:53:44.375]  And now as we're looking at, again, remember the reason people are leaving.
[03:53:44.956 --> 03:53:46.556]  I just talked about South America.
[03:53:46.596 --> 03:53:47.917]  Take a trip to Africa.
[03:53:48.417 --> 03:53:50.998]  Wonderful time going on there in the Congo, huh?
[03:53:52.560 --> 03:53:54.501]  It had an election about almost two weeks ago.
[03:53:54.521 --> 03:53:56.402]  They haven't decided who won yet.
[03:53:57.723 --> 03:54:00.004]  Yeah, it's one country after another.
[03:54:00.264 --> 03:54:00.884]  Sudan?
[03:54:01.164 --> 03:54:01.424]  Poof!
[03:54:02.185 --> 03:54:04.566]  People are out in the streets by the millions.
[03:54:06.247 --> 03:54:08.648]  One country after another destabilized.
[03:54:11.890 --> 03:54:12.710]  South Africa?
[03:54:12.730 --> 03:54:14.311]  Eh, they were only in a recession.
[03:54:15.098 --> 03:54:19.442]  Going back to South America, wonderful time going over there in Argentina.
[03:54:19.822 --> 03:54:25.087]  Just got a 57 billion dollar bailout from the International Mafia Federation.
[03:54:26.728 --> 03:54:30.271]  They got interest rates over there between 60 to 70 percent.
[03:54:30.952 --> 03:54:33.754]  Peso lost about 50 percent against a dollar.
[03:54:35.396 --> 03:54:38.919]  Brazil, everybody's, you know, Bolsonaro, Bolsonaro, okay, great.
[03:54:40.127 --> 03:54:44.330]  They're just in there getting out of their worst recession in a hundred years.
[03:54:44.390 --> 03:54:48.373]  Going back to Africa, you think the people are going to try to get into Europe?
[03:54:50.034 --> 03:54:52.016]  And those wars going on in Libya?
[03:54:52.716 --> 03:54:56.159]  And by the way, this baloney about we're going to get rid of ISIS in Syria?
[03:54:59.501 --> 03:55:00.802]  Had nothing to do with ISIS.
[03:55:01.583 --> 03:55:08.668]  Obama, the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Hitler E. Clinton, Samantha Power, Susan Rice, and lowlife Kerry,
[03:55:09.329 --> 03:55:24.774]  The Secretary of State, or whatever he was, Clinton became Secretary of State, they launched that war to get rid of Assad.
[03:55:25.394 --> 03:55:26.775]  All you got to do is Google it up.
[03:55:27.835 --> 03:55:29.055]  That was about the war in Syria.
[03:55:29.075 --> 03:55:30.676]  It had nothing to do with ISIS.
[03:55:31.216 --> 03:55:36.378]  The ISIS are by the way, they're funded by Saudi Arabia and the United States.
[03:55:37.085 --> 03:55:38.546]  I was talking about Libya first.
[03:55:38.586 --> 03:55:41.587]  That's when they put that group together to get rid of Gaddafi.
[03:55:43.488 --> 03:55:48.310]  The United States is the ones that have caused this destabilization in the Middle East.
[03:55:50.791 --> 03:55:53.593]  So now you have all these people being bombed out of their houses.
[03:55:53.613 --> 03:55:55.934]  It's a huge issue.
[03:55:57.214 --> 03:55:58.635]  And it's going to be a dominant one.
[03:55:59.355 --> 03:56:00.056]  But you know what?
[03:56:01.716 --> 03:56:05.298]  In America, the numbers aren't that great.
[03:56:06.109 --> 03:56:09.331]  As to how many people are really against it.
[03:56:10.952 --> 03:56:12.374]  I had them here a second ago.
[03:56:12.494 --> 03:56:13.214]  Here they are.
[03:56:14.515 --> 03:56:21.500]  Poll found that 65% of Republicans say immigration is one of the top five problems facing the country.
[03:56:22.521 --> 03:56:24.922]  Democrats?
[03:56:25.403 --> 03:56:24.922]  37%.
[03:56:28.025 --> 03:56:29.266]  It's not only America.
[03:56:30.006 --> 03:56:30.767]  It's the world.
[03:56:31.367 --> 03:56:32.408]  Again, robotics.
[03:56:33.720 --> 03:56:39.084]  Taking over more and more jobs, more and more people coming onto the planet.
[03:56:39.565 --> 03:56:40.706]  It's going to be a huge issue.
[03:56:42.327 --> 03:56:48.072]  But people are talking without putting it together on a global scale.
[03:56:48.892 --> 03:57:02.884]  So as I say, all you folks that say, bring in more illegal immigrants, open your house up, bring them in, feed them, clothe them, educate them, pay for their health care,
[03:57:04.403 --> 03:57:07.245]  House them, if that's what you want to do.
[03:57:07.945 --> 03:57:09.386]  But don't ask me to do it.
[03:57:10.347 --> 03:57:15.330]  I want to take care of the people that are already here, that we're having trouble taking care of already.
[03:57:17.131 --> 03:57:28.638]  So, in wrapping up our economic 9-11 forecast, Trump just stopped it a bit by trumping the Fed chair.
[03:57:29.678 --> 03:57:30.559]  So keep tuned.
[03:57:31.400 --> 03:57:35.944]  To the Trends in the News, and to InfoWars, to see where the future is heading.
[03:57:36.384 --> 03:57:37.505]  Thanks for having me on.
[03:57:37.905 --> 03:57:39.146]  I'll be back when I see you.
[03:57:56.816 --> 03:58:00.098]  This is a solution for you and your family.
[03:58:00.398 --> 03:58:05.282]  This is something guaranteed, like oxygen and water, to sustain life.
[03:58:05.482 --> 03:58:07.183]  There are a bunch of bad halogens.
[03:58:07.283 --> 03:58:11.005]  There is one good halogen in the body, and it's pure atomic iodine.
[03:58:11.145 --> 03:58:13.167]  Most forms are bound, so you don't absorb them.
[03:58:13.227 --> 03:58:24.274]  But even microscopic amounts of the broken-down type are better than nothing, because your body recognizes it and takes it on, and tries to use it instead of bromine, chloride, fluorine, and the other bad ones.
[03:58:24.614 --> 03:58:27.235]  And there's a lot of things better than just wealth in this world.
[03:58:27.355 --> 03:58:28.475]  How about physical wealth?
[03:58:28.816 --> 03:58:30.836]  When I forget to pick my iodine, I'm an idiot.
[03:58:31.376 --> 03:58:32.437]  We have X2.
[03:58:32.517 --> 03:58:37.779]  It's selling out because a company tried to put me over the barrel from the oil well company that drills to get it at 12,000 feet.
[03:58:38.219 --> 03:58:39.759]  We ended up finding an even better company.
[03:58:39.939 --> 03:58:45.921]  Their chemist said, you can put this in the way you have it, but you should add a little bit of vitamin C to stabilize it so it doesn't oxidize.
[03:58:46.061 --> 03:58:47.482]  And this other form of iodine,
[03:58:47.902 --> 03:58:48.884]  That's X3.
[03:58:48.964 --> 03:58:52.589]  We have a limited supply of X2.
[03:58:52.809 --> 03:58:53.570]  It's our final run.
[03:58:53.830 --> 03:58:54.651]  But here are the headlines.
[03:58:54.671 --> 03:58:56.454]  That's Discovery Magazine.
