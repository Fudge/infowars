[00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:22.097]  May 31st, 2019.
[00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:24.238]  Already almost halfway into 2019.
[00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:27.880]  Incredible how time is accelerating.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.081]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.522]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:00:31.522 --> 00:00:38.666]  We have Robert Barnes, who's a great lawyer and really great talk show host, in studio with us for the second two hours.
[00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:43.909]  And I will open the phones up on a host of issues when he's in studio with us.
[00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:44.749]  I didn't do it yesterday.
[00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:45.530]  I will do it today.
[00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:51.215]  There is so much insane news that I've got to cover it all.
[00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:55.056]  And there's a bunch of news I didn't get to from yesterday that I want to try to cram in.
[00:00:55.056 --> 00:01:04.000]  So it's going to be a full broadcast here.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.765]  Every blue city in the country is not just collapsing into typhoid and leprosy and drug-resistant TB and literally hundreds of other diseases.
[00:01:16.786 --> 00:01:28.153]  They're collapsing into homelessness, drug abuse, needles, with a cherry on top of men dressed as women running around at public events with small children.
[00:01:28.153 --> 00:01:32.275]  That's the cherry on top.
[00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.416]  Was Sodom and Gomorrah real in the Bible?
[00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:36.497]  Archeologists think so.
[00:01:36.497 --> 00:01:38.739]  The Old Testament.
[00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.641]  But Sodom and Gomorrah is real today.
[00:01:42.641 --> 00:01:44.082]  I've got articles about blue cities.
[00:01:45.168 --> 00:01:51.490]  Where they go into the abortion clinics and there's just rotting babies and body parts and blood and rats and cockroaches everywhere.
[00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:04.954]  I mean, you couldn't run a hot dog stand and have it one-tenth as dirty, but because they're killing babies and it's such a royal right, well then, you know, you can get the woman infected and kill her too!
[00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:07.995]  It's just insane asylum level.
[00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:19.561]  But I want to play this piece again that's so important and I'll have it reposted in fullwords.com, the front page, that the crew put together because it boils down to insanity and the foaming at the mouth of the left.
[00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:24.363]  And when we come back, I'll give you the title of the video, but I'm going to have it reposted in fullwords.com.
[00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:26.904]  And it just goes with the famous song.
[00:02:26.904 --> 00:02:28.005]  They're coming to take me away.
[00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:29.346]  Ha ha hoo hee.
[00:02:29.346 --> 00:02:29.646]  Here it is.
[00:02:31.403 --> 00:02:32.364]  Warning!
[00:02:32.364 --> 00:02:39.407]  This broadcast contains subject matter that may offend liberal snowflakes.
[00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:41.588]  I don't give you permission to record me!
[00:02:41.588 --> 00:02:42.829]  You're on live right now!
[00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.070]  I don't give you permission!
[00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:51.774]  Remember when you ran away and I got on my knees and begged you not to leave because I go berserk?
[00:02:51.774 --> 00:03:00.018]  Well, you left me anyhow and then the days got worse and worse and now you see I've gone completely out of my mind!
[00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:03.960]  They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.263]  They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha!
[00:03:07.263 --> 00:03:17.533]  To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time, and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clean white coats, and they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:19.191]  Come here!
[00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:20.232]  Do nothing!
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.841]  They're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:42.463]  They're coming to take me away, ho-ho, he-he, ha-ha!
[00:03:42.463 --> 00:03:53.189]  This is a happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their thumbs and toes and they're coming to take me away, ha-ha!
[00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.470]  I'm gonna grow a magnificent pair of breasts!
[00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.694]  I cooked your food, I cleaned your house and this is how you pay me back for all my kind, unselfish, loving deeds!
[00:04:04.474 --> 00:04:12.417]  Well, you just wait, they'll find you yet, and when they do, they'll put you in the ASPCA, you mangy muck!
[00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:16.158]  They're coming to take me away, ha ha ha!
[00:04:16.158 --> 00:04:19.459]  They're coming to take me away, ho ho, hee hee, ha ha!
[00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.960]  To the funny farm, where life is beautiful all the time!
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.741]  And I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their clear white coats, and they're coming to take me away, ha ha ha!
[00:04:33.334 --> 00:04:34.517]  We're good.
[00:04:55.513 --> 00:04:59.695]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:02.097]  They've not shut down our speech!
[00:05:02.097 --> 00:05:07.600]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.104]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:05:15.104 --> 00:05:16.425]  Are you coming back?
[00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:17.566]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:18.186 --> 00:05:19.527]  We're at NewsWords.com.
[00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:21.789]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.791]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:28.536]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.798]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:32.399]  InfoWars!
[00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.081]  Don't tell me!
[00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:34.421]  Woo!
[00:05:37.145 --> 00:05:39.926]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:41.747]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:05:41.747 --> 00:05:44.349]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.690]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.192]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:05:50.192 --> 00:05:52.933]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:55.014]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:05:55.014 --> 00:05:56.295]  That's where they find it.
[00:05:56.295 --> 00:05:57.755]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:05:57.755 --> 00:05:58.596]  You just go there.
[00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.672]  Breaking news out of Silicon Valley.
[00:06:03.672 --> 00:06:08.475]  Facebook has banned a number of prominent conspiracy theorists and alt-right figures.
[00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:12.178]  Facebook is purging several high-profile names from its platform.
[00:06:12.178 --> 00:06:16.261]  This may be one of the biggest and most impactful decisions Facebook has ever made.
[00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:19.404]  Facebook taking steps to enforce its hate speech policies.
[00:06:19.404 --> 00:06:26.629]  Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson, Louis Farrakhan, Laura Loomer, all of them were designated dangerous.
[00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:27.170]  Dangerous.
[00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.750]  Dangerous.
[00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.271]  Dangerous.
[00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:29.411]  Dangerous people.
[00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:30.592]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:06:30.592 --> 00:06:31.493]  Dangerous individuals.
[00:06:31.753 --> 00:06:34.414]  Dangerous individuals and organizations.
[00:06:34.414 --> 00:06:37.116]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[00:06:37.116 --> 00:06:38.816]  Danger, Will Robinson, danger!
[00:06:38.816 --> 00:06:39.977]  They call me dangerous.
[00:06:39.977 --> 00:06:41.598]  Danger's my middle name.
[00:06:41.598 --> 00:06:43.678]  Dangerous like hurting other people?
[00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:47.020]  Or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like?
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:51.722]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:53.383]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:06:53.383 --> 00:06:57.985]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and InfoWars.com?
[00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:00.506]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:02.708]  None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[00:07:02.708 --> 00:07:05.451]  Infowars content is useful to him.
[00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:07.894]  Infowars personalities align with him.
[00:07:07.894 --> 00:07:08.975]  I want them shut down.
[00:07:08.975 --> 00:07:09.936]  I want them silenced.
[00:07:09.936 --> 00:07:10.656]  I want them muted.
[00:07:10.656 --> 00:07:12.779]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:14.480]  I want them shut down!
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.702]  I want them silenced!
[00:07:15.702 --> 00:07:16.602]  I want them muted!
[00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.786]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal few.
[00:07:21.656 --> 00:07:39.457]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content, and we're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[00:07:39.497 --> 00:07:40.518]  Screw your rules!
[00:07:40.518 --> 00:07:43.899]  Your rules go against our values, and they are patently un-American.
[00:07:43.899 --> 00:07:46.961]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[00:07:46.961 --> 00:07:51.163]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[00:07:51.163 --> 00:07:53.704]  We need a digital Bill of Rights.
[00:07:53.704 --> 00:07:57.606]  They're becoming the public square, and they control how we interact with each other.
[00:07:57.606 --> 00:08:04.630]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane, and you are part of the problem.
[00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:05.951]  You are a bad person.
[00:08:05.951 --> 00:08:07.371]  You should be censored off the internet.
[00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:08.552]  Bad, yes!
[00:08:08.552 --> 00:08:09.812]  Get out of here, Alex!
[00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:14.314]  InfoWars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[00:08:14.314 --> 00:08:23.439]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:29.021]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:08:29.021 --> 00:08:30.522]  How dangerous is InfoWars?
[00:08:32.816 --> 00:08:34.397]  How dangerous is America?
[00:08:34.397 --> 00:08:36.358]  How dangerous is freedom?
[00:08:36.358 --> 00:08:38.019]  How dangerous is free speech?
[00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:41.461]  Well, it's dangerous to tyrants.
[00:08:41.461 --> 00:08:58.032]  Yeah, they say that Waylon Jennings, and Willie Nelson, Chris Christopherson, and Johnny Cash were outlaw country music because they bucked Nashville.
[00:08:58.032 --> 00:08:59.513]  Why, they claim rock stars.
[00:09:01.385 --> 00:09:07.428]  Outlaw, because they got pyrotechnics at their concerts.
[00:09:07.428 --> 00:09:25.077]  But how outlaw is it when all you're doing is supporting your country, your republic, your freedoms against classical tyranny, and then in your own land, you're hunted, you're lied about, you're assaulted, you're demonized.
[00:09:25.077 --> 00:09:26.758]  I'm not a victim.
[00:09:26.758 --> 00:09:30.260]  I'm a target because I'm effective just like all of you are out there.
[00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:36.746]  And we're not laying down without a fight with the globalists.
[00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:42.371]  We're taking it to them with everything we've got.
[00:09:42.371 --> 00:09:47.456]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:51.760]  A bunch of really important clips and yesterday's clips that I didn't get to.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.783]  And then the huge news.
[00:09:57.216 --> 00:10:08.898]  Dealing with the collapse of blue cities, not just here, but all over the world, leftist and communist cities are descending into nightmare hell pits.
[00:10:08.898 --> 00:10:19.161]  And it's reaching crisis proportion on the fetid leftist controlled West Coast.
[00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:25.562]  Separately, even liberal publications are reporting exactly what we broke six years ago.
[00:10:27.196 --> 00:10:28.897]  BuzzFeed!
[00:10:28.897 --> 00:10:29.297]  U.S.
[00:10:29.297 --> 00:10:38.442]  universities and retirees are funding the technology behind China's surveillance state.
[00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:48.387]  What did I tell Sundar Pichai, the head of Google, six months ago to his face in Congress?
[00:10:48.387 --> 00:10:51.028]  In hearings, talking about me, lying about me.
[00:10:52.697 --> 00:10:59.680]  I didn't get to be in the hearing, I didn't get to, I'm sat in the hearing, I didn't get to be questioned, I didn't get to respond, I just got lied about.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.321]  They've never done that in Congress until now.
[00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:12.084]  And I said, you're working with China, not just on Dragonfly, but other systems of surveillance and control, and you're exporting it back to the U.S.
[00:11:12.084 --> 00:11:16.206]  That of course was already known then, now it's all confirmed.
[00:11:16.206 --> 00:11:17.286]  That's a huge story.
[00:11:17.286 --> 00:11:19.947]  Then you've got all the leftist brainwashing.
[00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:26.567]  That's going on at lightning speed.
[00:11:26.567 --> 00:11:39.394]  If you look at what they did in Zimbabwe and South Africa, they would have reconciliation commissions where whites had to come in and say that they were bad people.
[00:11:39.394 --> 00:11:44.477]  Well, now that's being set up on universities here.
[00:11:44.477 --> 00:11:48.679]  And it's being exported into corporations and into government.
[00:11:49.775 --> 00:11:56.696]  Where you go into the meetings and you're told you're a horrible person and you agree that you're a horrible person.
[00:11:56.696 --> 00:12:07.539]  And that's why you see Joe Biden and Eric Swallowswell and Beto O'Rourke saying it's bad to be white.
[00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:09.479]  I apologize for being white.
[00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:10.859]  I'm a bad person.
[00:12:10.859 --> 00:12:12.140]  That's all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.140]  We're going to play some of those clips and then get into this.
[00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:22.834]  Group invites white women to voluntarily attend race-shaming dinners.
[00:12:22.834 --> 00:12:29.038]  That's up on newswars.com.
[00:12:29.038 --> 00:12:31.200]  Wrong on so many fronts.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.943]  This is creating race war, creating division, creating mental illness.
[00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:43.448]  And where these leftist brainwashed universities, no matter what color they are, they can only identify with things through color.
[00:12:44.215 --> 00:12:48.236]  And so, we not grow yucca in New York?
[00:12:48.236 --> 00:12:50.057]  That's not how Cortez used to talk.
[00:12:50.057 --> 00:12:56.259]  But whenever she's talking to a group of black folks, she puts on a weird urban accent.
[00:12:56.259 --> 00:13:03.522]  And then when she's in front of a group of Hispanics, she starts going, like Rick Perry does when he speaks to a Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
[00:13:03.522 --> 00:13:04.742]  He stops talking like Rick Perry.
[00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:08.903]  He starts going, how you do?
[00:13:08.903 --> 00:13:11.144]  Very condescending.
[00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:12.645]  But that's what leftists do, especially.
[00:13:13.407 --> 00:13:14.228]  They're famous for it.
[00:13:14.228 --> 00:13:15.068]  Remember Hillary?
[00:13:15.068 --> 00:13:19.391]  Gets up in front of people in Kentucky and she goes, how you doing today?
[00:13:19.391 --> 00:13:24.895]  Talking like granny about possum getting cooked up in the oven.
[00:13:24.895 --> 00:13:28.018]  Possum pie!
[00:13:28.018 --> 00:13:37.965]  And people thought it was satire when her defender went on Fox News and said, no, not only is cauliflower evil, corn is bad because it comes from Europe.
[00:13:39.008 --> 00:13:41.531]  It doesn't come from Europe, but so what if it did?
[00:13:41.531 --> 00:13:51.641]  This is the territorializing of everything by the left, where they're staking everything out and calling it racist.
[00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:58.088]  Martin Luther King is being removed all over the United States ecologists, because he wasn't leftist enough.
[00:14:00.936 --> 00:14:01.576]  You understand?
[00:14:01.576 --> 00:14:03.037]  He's the old face.
[00:14:03.037 --> 00:14:17.341]  So all the old FBI stuff's now being trotted out with no evidence against King, because King's now gonna be incinerated and removed, because he said, don't judge people by what color they are, but how they live and what they do and what they produce.
[00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:18.921]  Judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:14:18.921 --> 00:14:21.822]  He wasn't the first person to say, two plus two equals four.
[00:14:21.822 --> 00:14:26.744]  We're gonna get into all of that.
[00:14:26.744 --> 00:14:27.884]  But the first thing we're gonna hit
[00:14:29.127 --> 00:14:39.435]  When we come back, is medieval diseases are infecting California's homeless, now spreading to local citizens, school children, and police officers.
[00:14:39.435 --> 00:14:46.421]  California, the land of infectious disease, and it's not because of people being under vaccinated.
[00:14:46.421 --> 00:14:50.083]  It's the folks that have been vaccinated, the studies show, that are actually getting the sickest.
[00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:51.865]  Yeah, it removes your immune system.
[00:14:54.537 --> 00:14:55.598]  Dr. Drew says L.A.
[00:14:55.598 --> 00:14:57.339]  public health is a complete breakdown.
[00:14:57.339 --> 00:15:01.241]  No city on earth tolerates this.
[00:15:01.241 --> 00:15:06.004]  LAPD employee contracts typhoid.
[00:15:06.004 --> 00:15:07.525]  And it just gets worse.
[00:15:07.525 --> 00:15:09.145]  Seattle is dying.
[00:15:09.145 --> 00:15:10.206]  Portland is dying.
[00:15:10.206 --> 00:15:13.068]  And the left is celebrating.
[00:15:13.068 --> 00:15:19.391]  And I can play newscast where they celebrate men with jobs pooping on the street.
[00:15:19.391 --> 00:15:22.013]  And they've got liberal women going, it's Portland, do it!
[00:15:23.086 --> 00:15:25.648]  This is the mental illness.
[00:15:25.648 --> 00:15:27.570]  This is the demonic horde.
[00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:34.917]  You go to a Lepus event, this is who they are.
[00:15:34.917 --> 00:15:36.659]  It's all coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:36.659 --> 00:15:40.182]  We must expose it to stop it.
[00:15:40.182 --> 00:15:43.746]  Trump's upcoming trip to the UK and so much more.
[00:15:43.746 --> 00:15:43.806]  Oh!
[00:15:44.994 --> 00:15:46.937]  Jared Kushner at the Bilderberg meeting.
[00:15:46.937 --> 00:15:48.519]  What's my take on that?
[00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:52.506]  Last segment of the hour, I'm going to detail my view on it and so much more.
[00:15:52.506 --> 00:15:55.450]  Whatever you do, tell whoever you're around how they can tune in.
[00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.255]  Your word of mouth is absolutely critical to winning this war.
[00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:01.222]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[00:16:01.222 --> 00:16:04.443]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[00:16:06.044 --> 00:16:08.865]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:16:08.865 --> 00:16:09.545]  Awesome!
[00:16:09.545 --> 00:16:12.626]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.

[00:16:18.969 --> 00:16:20.410]  Or warm and served.
[00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.450]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.

[00:17:03.415 --> 00:17:05.496]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:17:05.496 --> 00:17:07.236]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:17:07.236 --> 00:17:13.798]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:18.879]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:03.877]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.877 --> 00:18:05.638]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.638 --> 00:18:16.903]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.683 --> 00:18:26.472]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:37.424]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.924 --> 00:18:40.526]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.526 --> 00:18:42.267]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:52.254]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.254 --> 00:18:54.916]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.916 --> 00:18:59.620]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:15.111]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.111 --> 00:20:18.093]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[00:20:18.093 --> 00:20:20.255]  Because it leads to the future.
[00:20:20.255 --> 00:20:23.719]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[00:20:23.719 --> 00:20:25.961]  This is not a new world.
[00:20:25.961 --> 00:20:29.244]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:38.759]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:46.825]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:20:46.825 --> 00:20:52.569]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:20:52.569 --> 00:20:54.791]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:02.874]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[00:21:02.874 --> 00:21:09.540]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:14.304]  Because he's built out of flesh, and because he has a mind.
[00:21:14.304 --> 00:21:18.969]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[00:21:39.835 --> 00:21:41.176]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:41.176 --> 00:21:42.677]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:45.959]  This is the InfoWar.
[00:21:45.959 --> 00:21:59.666]  We couldn't do it without you, the viewers and listeners, station managers and owners, and this incredible crew that stands in defiance of the globalist censorship and tyranny and stands between the globalists and all of us.
[00:21:59.666 --> 00:22:05.390]  This crew, this audience, this operation, our transmission is dead on.
[00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:09.952]  Vaporizing the enemy with truth, and they can't stand it.
[00:22:09.952 --> 00:22:27.201]  This transmission is a wartime broadcast, organically produced by the people of the United States and Texas, in direct resistance against the global government, corporate, post-human, dehumanization, silicon, AI, world government takeover, technocracy.
[00:22:27.201 --> 00:22:28.342]  That's in their words.
[00:22:28.342 --> 00:22:30.923]  We are countering them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:41.356]  It's in the WikiLeaks, it's in their own statements, it's in CIA declassifications, a Ford Foundation leftist inside the CIA, not the whole CIA.
[00:22:41.356 --> 00:22:44.538]  That's critical to understand.
[00:22:44.538 --> 00:23:01.529]  That they want to dehumanize, they want to make you desperate, they want to break up your family, they want to have ugly architecture, they want to destroy language, they want to destroy communication, because an informed, upwardly mobile population stands in the way of the globalists.
[00:23:03.723 --> 00:23:12.870]  I went and saw Godzilla last night, and for a cheesy Godzilla movie, it's the best Godzilla movie I ever saw.
[00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:17.774]  Spoiler alert, because of the plot.
[00:23:17.774 --> 00:23:19.736]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:23:19.736 --> 00:23:23.499]  That's what you're going to be watching.
[00:23:23.499 --> 00:23:30.545]  Environmental terrorist, 12 monkey type, want to release
[00:23:32.461 --> 00:23:40.666]  These dormant titans to destroy humans and save the Earth.
[00:23:40.666 --> 00:23:42.287]  It's incredible.
[00:23:42.287 --> 00:23:58.078]  And the environmental terrorists want to release radiation that'll kill humans, but they believe re-green the Earth, which is something that modern leftists now say, oh, we didn't like nuclear power before, but now we're for it because it'll kill humans.
[00:23:58.078 --> 00:24:01.160]  That's main line top leftists.
[00:24:04.798 --> 00:24:31.197]  So when you go see this, ladies and gentlemen, you are literally being prepared and programmed for mass bioweapon plagues, collapse of civilization, you name it, and that you deserve it, and it's the right thing to do, because there was an ancient Atlantean civilization that was also destroyed because it got out of balance.
[00:24:31.197 --> 00:24:33.059]  And so aliens attacked the Earth,
[00:24:34.517 --> 00:24:36.958]  To wipe out humanity.
[00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:43.321]  But then Godzilla, this archetype of the Earth, of the Earth Spirit, stood up and resisted it.
[00:24:43.321 --> 00:24:49.925]  But Godzilla might have to come back and kill the humans, they tell you at the end of the movie.
[00:24:49.925 --> 00:24:52.106]  Now, now, why is this in all the movies?
[00:24:52.106 --> 00:24:59.950]  This is, when you see Endgame, it's still for free on YouTube, they haven't taken it down off a fan channel we let post it years ago, 12 years ago.
[00:25:01.311 --> 00:25:02.291]  It's been taken on everywhere else.
[00:25:02.291 --> 00:25:04.712]  It had like 80 million views on Google Video.
[00:25:04.712 --> 00:25:06.233]  They took that down years ago.
[00:25:06.233 --> 00:25:08.514]  They just made it defunct.
[00:25:08.514 --> 00:25:09.134]  It just went away.
[00:25:09.134 --> 00:25:12.496]  But it's there.
[00:25:12.496 --> 00:25:14.077]  This won't be Godzilla.
[00:25:14.077 --> 00:25:16.238]  This won't be fiction.
[00:25:16.238 --> 00:25:20.039]  This will be globalists, their quotes, their statements of how they're planning all this.
[00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:22.940]  Now, why am I getting into that right now?
[00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:23.741]  When you see
[00:25:25.425 --> 00:25:53.952]  Every major European city collapsing under hundreds of thousands of North Africans and Islamists out of the Middle East, and feces everywhere, and rape everywhere, and when you see families thrown out of their houses to put the invaders in, and when you see all the major leftist cities of the world filled with knife attacks, acid attacks, piles of feces, piles of garbage, rats everywhere,
[00:25:56.388 --> 00:26:00.131]  That is an admitted plan.
[00:26:00.131 --> 00:26:07.316]  They set up the parameters of the system for collapse.
[00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:10.238]  They're breaking our borders, our courts.
[00:26:10.238 --> 00:26:19.484]  They're bankrupting the social safety net because the globalists are at war with equally distributed civilization.
[00:26:21.738 --> 00:26:33.624]  And by equally distributed civilization, open, free civilization, egalitarian, truly liberal, classical in nature, renaissance.
[00:26:33.624 --> 00:26:36.605]  The EU was shut up to destroy the nation states of Europe.
[00:26:36.605 --> 00:26:38.266]  They bragged about it.
[00:26:38.266 --> 00:26:42.728]  To put them in debt, suck them dry and blow them, bring down Europe's borders.
[00:26:42.728 --> 00:26:43.068]  Flood them.
[00:26:44.332 --> 00:26:46.314]  North American Union was set up for that.
[00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:56.162]  All of these things are set up to wage war against independent groups and consolidate power in vertical integration.
[00:26:56.162 --> 00:27:00.005]  Now, when I use words like vertical integration, that's an establishment term.
[00:27:00.005 --> 00:27:03.408]  When I use terms like technocracy, that's what they call themselves.
[00:27:03.408 --> 00:27:05.510]  It's technocrats running a technocracy.
[00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.511]  Go look it up.
[00:27:06.511 --> 00:27:09.814]  From Davos, to Bloomberg, to the Rockefellers, to the shy cops.
[00:27:11.553 --> 00:27:16.877]  A computer-run dictatorship with them programming it.
[00:27:16.877 --> 00:27:19.158]  You're in 2019, folks.
[00:27:19.158 --> 00:27:20.259]  You're about to be in 2020.
[00:27:20.259 --> 00:27:25.262]  You're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:27:25.262 --> 00:27:27.203]  This is their plan.
[00:27:27.203 --> 00:27:28.324]  Break up your family.
[00:27:28.324 --> 00:27:28.985]  Bankrupt you.
[00:27:28.985 --> 00:27:30.305]  Make sure you don't have a job.
[00:27:30.305 --> 00:27:35.989]  Make sure that you're on welfare so they can control and dictate your life.
[00:27:35.989 --> 00:27:38.211]  When we come back, I'll play these newscast clips.
[00:27:39.246 --> 00:27:41.968]  Where even the left is saying, what have we done?
[00:27:41.968 --> 00:27:44.089]  It's a living hell.
[00:27:44.089 --> 00:27:45.990]  That's the plan.
[00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:55.035]  All over the world, you'll have mountains and plenty of rain for the farmers, like they have in Southern Oregon, Northern California.
[00:27:55.035 --> 00:28:08.343]  But for a decade plus, bullshit it too, they turned all the water off, even though there was huge mountain lakes full of water, that were built, artificial lakes, reservoirs,
[00:28:09.639 --> 00:28:16.303]  To create farming belts in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s.
[00:28:16.303 --> 00:28:18.444]  It stopped.
[00:28:18.444 --> 00:28:28.450]  They then said because of a fish that's invasive, not even the law, you can't have water for a decade and drove everyone out.
[00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.291]  Now they're buying it up for nothing.
[00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:31.452]  Then they'll turn the water back on.
[00:28:32.307 --> 00:28:33.827]  This is the plan.
[00:28:33.827 --> 00:28:43.410]  And when you start thinking like a globalist, you'll understand their larger operation, and then you'll have a chance of stopping them.
[00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:55.934]  But their plan is deindustrialization for you, then they siphon all the technology and money into their system, the breakaway civilization, the opposite of an equally distributed civilization.
[00:28:55.934 --> 00:28:57.535]  The essence of elitism.
[00:28:59.406 --> 00:29:00.929]  Oh, these pains.
[00:29:00.929 --> 00:29:03.453]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[00:29:03.453 --> 00:29:05.275]  I've got to get some relief.
[00:29:05.275 --> 00:29:10.984]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[00:29:10.984 --> 00:29:12.867]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[00:29:12.867 --> 00:29:14.650]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?
[00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:15.290]  Yes.

[00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:03.115]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[00:31:03.115 --> 00:31:05.699]  That what God gave us through Mother Nature is incredible.
[00:31:05.699 --> 00:31:08.482]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[00:31:08.482 --> 00:31:10.485]  And the globalists are so upset.
[00:31:10.485 --> 00:31:13.309]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[00:31:14.557 --> 00:31:19.618]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets you take in the morning and you take at night.
[00:31:19.618 --> 00:31:20.578]  So we looked at that.
[00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:22.199]  We made the very best a.m.

[00:33:02.856 --> 00:33:05.517]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:16.804 --> 00:33:19.246]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:19.246 --> 00:33:22.449]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:22.449 --> 00:33:36.741]  With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound, he pulls the spitting high-tension wire down.
[00:33:55.717 --> 00:33:56.077]  I think.
[00:34:18.493 --> 00:34:34.778]  So, we can joke around about, oh, you know, Godzilla movie, there's a secret world government system, and people hijack the world government system to release a bioweapon upon the earth to kill all the humans.
[00:34:34.778 --> 00:34:39.540]  The bioweapons happen to be a thousand feet tall.
[00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.820]  But they're biological weapons.
[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.042]  And they say to cleanse the earth of the evil humans.
[00:34:46.741 --> 00:34:54.565]  And this is all part of the idea that humans are inherently bad in every case, and so getting rid of us is a good thing.
[00:34:54.565 --> 00:34:55.685]  We suck.
[00:34:55.685 --> 00:34:56.326]  We're ugly.
[00:34:56.326 --> 00:34:58.827]  We need to give up our life force.
[00:34:58.827 --> 00:35:00.988]  We need to give up our survival instinct.
[00:35:00.988 --> 00:35:02.128]  We need to just go away.
[00:35:02.128 --> 00:35:03.969]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:35:03.969 --> 00:35:04.830]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:35:06.533 --> 00:35:19.080]  Now, the globalists just want you to hate yourself so you won't want to achieve anything, you won't want to control your own destiny, you won't want to be involved, so they can, quote, own the future.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.842]  That's an establishment term.
[00:35:21.842 --> 00:35:25.164]  Own the future.
[00:35:25.164 --> 00:35:30.147]  So they can have their breakaway civilization, and so all of us profane people,
[00:35:33.595 --> 00:35:37.518]  Well, we're debating whether Cauliflower is racist or not, because AOC said so.
[00:35:37.518 --> 00:35:39.960]  Well, we're all busy doing that.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:49.428]  They're laughing at us, siphoning all of our research, all of our technology off, and building a breakaway civilization, which again, the new Godzilla movie shows you.
[00:35:49.428 --> 00:35:56.394]  Underground bases and advanced spacecraft and advanced weapons and advanced airborne troop carriers.
[00:35:56.394 --> 00:35:58.796]  A lot of stuff that has actually been built.
[00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:05.432]  And they're just showing it to you in the movie.
[00:36:05.432 --> 00:36:20.796]  In fact, real insiders wrote the script because the symbol of the infinity hourglass is actually a major underground secret government project symbol.
[00:36:20.796 --> 00:36:28.138]  So again, this is total revelation of the method and you can look at it two ways.
[00:36:28.138 --> 00:36:29.639]  They're either telling you
[00:36:30.595 --> 00:36:38.362]  Hey, we know there's bad groups that want to kill everybody with their world government, but we've decided that's not a good project and it'll be too out of control.
[00:36:38.362 --> 00:36:42.085]  Because we wanted to just slowly cut you back.
[00:36:42.085 --> 00:36:44.507]  We didn't want to kill everybody.
[00:36:44.507 --> 00:36:51.913]  And now we realize once this gets out of Pandora's box, that this thing wants to kill the planet, which is Satan.
[00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:55.412]  Or the false king?
[00:36:55.412 --> 00:36:56.972]  Oh yes, it's all biblical.
[00:36:56.972 --> 00:37:08.235]  You've got Satan, they call him the false king, the three-headed dragon, the alien, and then you've got Godzilla, the Atlantean god, come to save us out of the ocean.
[00:37:08.235 --> 00:37:15.617]  I mean, this is beyond Illuminati.
[00:37:15.617 --> 00:37:19.298]  And the symbolism of the cross with the dragon on top of the mountain?
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.381]  It's all there.
[00:37:22.381 --> 00:37:23.781]  Unbelievable.
[00:37:23.781 --> 00:37:27.142]  You could write a book about the symbolism in this.
[00:37:27.142 --> 00:37:29.423]  This is revelation of the method.
[00:37:29.423 --> 00:37:34.164]  In fact, I'm gonna go back and see it tomorrow and I'm gonna write notes.
[00:37:34.164 --> 00:37:39.566]  Because my mouth was hanging open.
[00:37:39.566 --> 00:37:44.167]  Now, why am I getting into this so much with all this other news?
[00:37:44.167 --> 00:37:47.808]  Because if you look at the original Godzilla idea that the establishment adopted,
[00:37:49.352 --> 00:37:51.655]  Japan had been bombed with two A-bombs.
[00:37:51.655 --> 00:37:55.579]  Half their population had been killed in major cities.
[00:37:55.579 --> 00:38:02.207]  Godzilla symbolizes somebody that's angry at radiation tests, angry at war, or woken up by it.
[00:38:02.207 --> 00:38:03.849]  And so he comes and attacks Tokyo.
[00:38:03.849 --> 00:38:07.633]  Later, he becomes this guardian character.
[00:38:07.633 --> 00:38:09.675]  But again, that goes back to that ethos.
[00:38:10.748 --> 00:38:12.249]  That humans are bad.
[00:38:12.249 --> 00:38:14.910]  The truth is, in many areas, humans improve the environment.
[00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.211]  In many areas, we hurt it.
[00:38:16.211 --> 00:38:19.133]  The point is, is that we're the advanced species.
[00:38:19.133 --> 00:38:22.635]  To save the Earth, we've got to go into space.
[00:38:22.635 --> 00:38:25.197]  I grew up hearing that, reading that, knowing that.
[00:38:25.197 --> 00:38:33.922]  Jeff Bezos, who I've been very critical of in many ways, is nothing compared to the other big tech heads.
[00:38:33.922 --> 00:38:35.403]  He at least works with the U.S.
[00:38:35.403 --> 00:38:36.203]  government.
[00:38:36.203 --> 00:38:39.265]  He at least works for a pro-human space program in the future.
[00:38:40.902 --> 00:38:44.024]  He's not working with Communist China, like Apple and Google are.
[00:38:44.024 --> 00:38:52.488]  And I'm not saying that to kiss Bezos' ass.
[00:38:52.488 --> 00:38:56.490]  I'm saying that because it's the truth.
[00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:58.171]  You don't get worse than Apple.
[00:38:58.171 --> 00:38:59.752]  You don't get worse than Google.
[00:38:59.752 --> 00:39:01.593]  You don't get worse than Facebook.
[00:39:01.593 --> 00:39:04.394]  You don't get worse than Twitter, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:07.162 --> 00:39:18.551]  These people are out of control, allied with Communist China, that archetypally, from another perspective, and they've got symbolism in the film, the three-headed dragon is also China.
[00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:20.192]  Very sophisticated.
[00:39:20.192 --> 00:39:27.658]  Oh yeah, the Chinese government, I saw this a few days ago, is saying they're not going to let Godzilla be seen in China.
[00:39:27.658 --> 00:39:30.200]  Why's that?
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:30.540]  Why's that?
[00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:44.458]  Because it's got pro-Japanese samurai seppuku culture in it as well.
[00:39:44.458 --> 00:39:47.300]  It's sophisticated.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:51.683]  Jeff Bezos will have to go to space to save the Earth.
[00:39:51.683 --> 00:40:03.813]  But instead of... Instead of Godzilla and the big three-headed dragon tearing up Boston, New York, D.C., the areas of Mexico,
[00:40:06.667 --> 00:40:08.188]  What's really hitting us?
[00:40:08.188 --> 00:40:18.758]  The globalists on record collapsing third world countries, destroying their infrastructure, siphoning all the money off so that they would never be able to develop.
[00:40:18.758 --> 00:40:27.387]  That is in State Department memorandums from Henry Kissinger in 1970.
[00:40:27.387 --> 00:40:28.488]  But the global policy
[00:40:29.926 --> 00:40:47.870]  Was to not let the third world ever have its own civilization, but to only have centralized civilization islands in the third world that exploit the general populations and extract the wealth to create a breakaway civilization.
[00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:51.070]  So see how this works?
[00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.571]  So this is the global plan.
[00:40:52.571 --> 00:40:58.912]  And so once you've exploited the populations, but allowed them to explode in numbers,
[00:41:01.178 --> 00:41:03.919]  You then brainwash them.
[00:41:03.919 --> 00:41:10.441]  You then send them to refugee training camp systems.
[00:41:10.441 --> 00:41:15.722]  And then you march them into the West to conquer what's left.
[00:41:15.722 --> 00:41:17.363]  The globalists have already conquered the third world.
[00:41:17.363 --> 00:41:27.106]  You know, I saw an article a few days ago that Jordan Klepper guy engaging in defamation as political hacks, you know, do for the enemy.
[00:41:29.089 --> 00:41:32.111]  I listened to part of a podcast this morning that I may do a special report on.
[00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:34.673]  It's not worthy of the main show.
[00:41:34.673 --> 00:41:37.875]  But I listened to about half of it.
[00:41:37.875 --> 00:41:45.479]  He was on some podcast launching his new show talking about me and lying about me and saying, yeah, Jones admits, you know, he's fake.
[00:41:45.479 --> 00:41:46.560]  He's playing a character.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.420]  They never play a clip.
[00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:48.181]  They never show the quote.
[00:41:49.755 --> 00:41:51.797]  Clepper just says, oh, I watched his deposition.
[00:41:51.797 --> 00:41:53.819]  He almost admits he's playing a character.
[00:41:53.819 --> 00:41:55.581]  I almost admit.
[00:41:55.581 --> 00:41:56.582]  Okay.
[00:41:56.582 --> 00:41:58.404]  Never said any such thing.
[00:41:58.404 --> 00:42:01.968]  You don't get more real, totally committed and hardcore than me.
[00:42:01.968 --> 00:42:02.909]  I mean, this is it.
[00:42:02.909 --> 00:42:06.552]  This is who I am.
[00:42:06.552 --> 00:42:09.936]  But see, a phony like him, he wants me to be who he is.
[00:42:12.156 --> 00:42:14.197]  He wants me to be this empty person.
[00:42:14.197 --> 00:42:17.918]  But here's how I listen to news, especially podcasts.
[00:42:17.918 --> 00:42:21.219]  I wasn't listening to hear about myself.
[00:42:21.219 --> 00:42:22.680]  I knew what I was going to hear.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:27.842]  Pinhead, elitism, believing he's a ruling class establishment from the universities.
[00:42:27.842 --> 00:42:30.983]  He says my mission.
[00:42:30.983 --> 00:42:34.244]  He admits everything he does is leftist and globalist.
[00:42:34.244 --> 00:42:37.825]  He admits that everything he does is for the cause.
[00:42:37.825 --> 00:42:38.726]  And then he talks about
[00:42:39.955 --> 00:42:50.720]  Refugee camps that the left has built in Georgia, and how they're brainwashing the illegal aliens to hate America and to be communists, and how he got arrested.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:57.284]  And of course, we already knew all this, but man, I mean, these people, and how the Clintons are directing him, he's so proud of it.
[00:42:59.665 --> 00:43:00.986]  Shut down our speech!
[00:43:00.986 --> 00:43:06.490]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:13.995]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:43:13.995 --> 00:43:15.316]  Are you coming back?
[00:43:15.316 --> 00:43:16.457]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:43:17.057 --> 00:43:18.418]  We're at NewsWords.com.
[00:43:18.418 --> 00:43:20.679]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:22.680]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:27.443]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[00:43:27.443 --> 00:43:29.684]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:43:29.684 --> 00:43:32.946]  InfoWars!
[00:43:32.946 --> 00:43:34.987]  Don't tell me!
[00:43:34.987 --> 00:43:35.087]  Woo!
[00:43:36.019 --> 00:43:38.801]  InfoWars.com, cause that's what's people out here.
[00:43:38.801 --> 00:43:40.622]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:43:40.622 --> 00:43:43.364]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:43:43.364 --> 00:43:45.585]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:43:45.585 --> 00:43:49.067]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:43:49.067 --> 00:43:51.809]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:43:51.809 --> 00:43:55.171]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, that's where they find it.
[00:43:55.171 --> 00:43:57.073]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:43:57.073 --> 00:43:57.493]  Just go there.
[00:43:59.542 --> 00:44:04.384]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[00:44:04.384 --> 00:44:13.846]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins and minerals needed daily.
[00:44:13.846 --> 00:44:18.628]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[00:44:18.628 --> 00:44:28.951]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs to support
[00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:29.451]  I think so.
[00:45:05.529 --> 00:45:07.870]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.311]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.
[00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:17.673]  That's why we're bringing you a brand new version of one of the newest fan-favorite products, The Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:45:17.673 --> 00:45:23.195]  The Real Red Pill Plus is an all-new version of the powerhouse preglanone product.

[00:45:31.338 --> 00:45:37.762]  A powerful preglanone base, the Real Red Pill, has quickly become one of our fellow InfoWarriors' favorite products.

[00:45:52.871 --> 00:45:56.132]  Get the Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:04.218]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:46:04.218 --> 00:46:05.279]  They are technocrats.
[00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:07.582]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:46:07.582 --> 00:46:14.453]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:46:14.913 --> 00:46:16.794]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:46:16.794 --> 00:46:19.256]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:46:19.256 --> 00:46:25.761]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:46:25.761 --> 00:46:30.944]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warsandlife.com, I couldn't do it.
[00:46:30.944 --> 00:46:39.950]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12, that was incredibly high quality, and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:46.912]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[00:46:46.912 --> 00:46:47.853]  It is amazing.
[00:46:47.853 --> 00:46:57.855]  Experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American Revolution against the tyrants at InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:57.855 --> 00:46:59.555]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:37.799 --> 00:47:48.307]  Alex Jones back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:48.307 --> 00:47:54.691]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am very impressed by Godzilla King of the Monsters.
[00:47:54.691 --> 00:47:56.473]  I have never seen one film
[00:47:57.386 --> 00:48:01.769]  That gives you the entire revelation of the method plan.
[00:48:01.769 --> 00:48:10.416]  The fallen three-headed dragon of revelation whose power is the sky.
[00:48:10.416 --> 00:48:13.439]  Attempting to destroy the earth.
[00:48:13.439 --> 00:48:22.626]  Working with human counterparts inside a secret government agency that want to exterminate humanity.
[00:48:22.626 --> 00:48:26.409]  This movie is Satan versus Godzilla.
[00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:29.731]  And it gets into all of it.
[00:48:29.731 --> 00:48:33.333]  The World Population Reduction Program.
[00:48:33.333 --> 00:48:38.397]  Actual blueprints that I've seen and that others have seen that have been talked about.
[00:48:38.397 --> 00:48:43.480]  About large carrier aircraft for Ospreys.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:47.422]  And this is a full-on U.S.
[00:48:47.422 --> 00:48:48.343]  government production.
[00:48:49.966 --> 00:48:51.527]  And I would not say this is a U.S.
[00:48:51.527 --> 00:48:56.272]  government production of the Obama type or the Netflix type and all the stuff you've been saying.
[00:48:56.272 --> 00:48:59.415]  I don't know how they got this movie out.
[00:48:59.415 --> 00:49:06.000]  Because if you know what you're watching, it is a very Christian movie, extremely anti-Satan.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.943]  But that's only part of it.
[00:49:08.943 --> 00:49:11.726]  Truly incredible.
[00:49:11.726 --> 00:49:15.129]  But it's not gonna be thousand-foot tall kaijus.
[00:49:17.358 --> 00:49:25.501]  Stomping out of the oceans and flying out of the sky from revelation.
[00:49:25.501 --> 00:49:45.388]  We are currently watching the purposeful destruction of our planet by deindustrialization, by the destruction of the infrastructure, which if you destroy the infrastructure and you've got seven and a half billion people, it's like releasing seven and a half billion weaponized army ants
[00:49:48.208 --> 00:49:50.630]  That will eat everything to the bone.
[00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:51.811]  It's a time bomb.
[00:49:51.811 --> 00:49:56.335]  If you don't keep civilization arcing upward, it goes down.
[00:49:56.335 --> 00:50:02.600]  The trajectory of a rocket is up or it's down.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.824]  This trajectory, ladies and gentlemen, was going straight up towards the stars and beyond.
[00:50:08.331 --> 00:50:27.189]  Now the globalists are turning us down and if we don't pull up, if Trump doesn't pull up, it is going to be curtains and the people that thought they're setting this world government in motion to cleanse the earth and only call certain people and go in their secret government bunkers and they're going to be safe.
[00:50:27.189 --> 00:50:33.395]  The message of Godzilla, King of the Monsters is that plan is being aborted and we're no longer following it.
[00:50:36.828 --> 00:50:45.370]  Yeah, I'd say Godzilla King of the Monsters is an Infowars Trump production.
[00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:57.834]  If you want to really get down to brass tacks, the people that wrote this movie know what's going on, are on the inside, and understand what's happening, and it's a desperate, desperate warning.
[00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:08.275]  That the globalists should stop playing God, the whole world's turned against them, and they're working with an off-world entity that wants to destroy all life on the planet.
[00:51:08.275 --> 00:51:09.916]  A kill shot.
[00:51:09.916 --> 00:51:11.937]  It's quite frankly astounding.
[00:51:11.937 --> 00:51:21.261]  It's got the cheesy kind of amusement ride, you know, stuff for kids where they're getting shot at and stuff's blowing up and, you know, you feel like you're on a roller coaster and a woman's being chased by the monster.
[00:51:22.669 --> 00:51:36.840]  It's got a lot of cheesiness in it, but the message is super sophisticated on so many levels.
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.362]  Now let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen, with the really big news.
[00:51:39.362 --> 00:51:44.867]  Let's talk about the real world and how we're being deindustrialized and shut down right now.
[00:51:44.867 --> 00:51:46.048]  Disney has come out.
[00:51:47.185 --> 00:52:00.338]  Along with others, Netflix, and told Georgia and other states, because you don't want to kill babies in the third trimester, or after they're born, we are going to pull out of your state and bully you.
[00:52:00.338 --> 00:52:02.720]  Oh, what a high and mighty good person you are.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:11.048]  Funny, corporate tyranny, Netflix, Disney threatened Georgia over abortion ban, despite the fact that Disney's been filming in Bolivia.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.220]  That's a NewsWars.com article detailing
[00:52:39.372 --> 00:52:39.952]  That fact.
[00:52:39.952 --> 00:52:43.174]  There's also another article on the Daily Caller where they go over all of it.
[00:52:43.174 --> 00:52:47.557]  I know I said I'd get into Jared Kushner and his Bilderberg visit and what I think of that.
[00:52:47.557 --> 00:52:49.719]  I'll do that at the start of the next hour.
[00:52:49.719 --> 00:52:51.740]  I'm behind some Robert Barnes.
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.401]  He's doing great work with us here behind the scenes.
[00:52:53.401 --> 00:52:55.242]  Got big stuff about to happen.
[00:52:55.242 --> 00:52:56.523]  He's also a great talk show host.
[00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:04.894]  He's going to be in studio with us 15 after for the rest of the show, the rest of the show until the fourth hour.
[00:53:04.894 --> 00:53:09.999]  And then we have Nick Baggett, who always does an amazing job on Fridays, hosting the fourth hour.
[00:53:09.999 --> 00:53:11.800]  Dr. Nick Baggett.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.563]  So that is coming up today.
[00:53:14.563 --> 00:53:21.890]  I have not gotten to all of these clips I said I would, but again, silent weapons require wars.
[00:53:23.160 --> 00:53:39.617]  Dissolve the family, get rid of the jobs, demoralize the population, bring in 10 million illegal aliens the last five, six years, and do not test them, and order the Border Patrol, do not test them for diseases.
[00:53:41.141 --> 00:53:46.607]  And then immediately bust them in, enroll them in school, and put them next to your kid with TB.
[00:53:46.607 --> 00:53:48.529]  What about the poor illegal alien kids?
[00:53:48.529 --> 00:53:49.670]  They should be tested.
[00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:50.411]  Your children.
[00:53:50.411 --> 00:53:52.613]  Oh, but then they blame you didn't take a vaccine.
[00:53:52.613 --> 00:53:53.034]  It's your fault.
[00:53:54.465 --> 00:53:55.686]  There is no vaccine for TB.
[00:53:55.686 --> 00:53:57.388]  It's all BS.
[00:53:57.388 --> 00:53:59.389]  This is a biological attack.
[00:53:59.389 --> 00:54:01.471]  This is an attempt to take us down.
[00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:11.139]  And again, they form them up at refugee centers, train them, give them $1,000 debit cards, give them cash, give them backpacks of food every step of the way.
[00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:13.141]  Every leg.
[00:54:13.141 --> 00:54:13.921]  Bring them in.
[00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:18.684]  And then I tune in to a podcast with the Jordan Klepper guy.
[00:54:18.684 --> 00:54:21.205]  He's like, I got arrested for my new show.
[00:54:21.205 --> 00:54:22.726]  We're not really doing comedy now.
[00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:25.968]  It's purely the mission to defeat Trump and defeat America.
[00:54:25.968 --> 00:54:26.869]  You're just listening to this.
[00:54:27.689 --> 00:54:54.526]  And, you know, and the mission is everything, and we're training these wonderful people at this, you know, secret school in Georgia, that we've brought up these illegal aliens, and we're going to, you know, win, and Hillary's directing me, and I'm so proud that I'm working directly with Hillary, you know, to take down Alex Jones, and the way to silence Alex Jones is to, he deserves to be taken off the air, I mean, it's like cartoonish how evil and un-American it is!
[00:54:56.377 --> 00:55:00.459]  But he's proud of it.
[00:55:00.459 --> 00:55:01.700]  So we'll come back.
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.082]  I'll play some of these newscasts about the diseases, all of it.
[00:55:04.082 --> 00:55:08.184]  But it's not that this Jordan Klepper guy is important.
[00:55:08.184 --> 00:55:08.624]  Seriously.
[00:55:08.624 --> 00:55:10.065]  I mean, he tried to get us to engage him.
[00:55:10.065 --> 00:55:12.847]  His show failed.
[00:55:12.847 --> 00:55:15.168]  I don't care about being attacked.
[00:55:15.168 --> 00:55:19.531]  It's the forensics of one article.
[00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:22.293]  They were trying to boost his new show's ratings by attacking me again.
[00:55:23.328 --> 00:55:28.651]  And then saying that I say I'm fake and I'm an actor, but there's no quote of me saying that, and it's made up.
[00:55:28.651 --> 00:55:40.037]  And then his pinheadedness where he just, oh my God, I couldn't believe I met with the Clintons and they're working with me and they're directing me and we're doing productions together and blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:40.037 --> 00:55:41.558]  And I actually went and looked it up.
[00:55:41.558 --> 00:55:44.880]  He's introducing the legend that this just happened magically.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.801]  No, the Clintons have a production company.
[00:55:49.028 --> 00:55:54.833]  They admit for feminist and leftist operations this directly taking over with Viacom.
[00:55:54.833 --> 00:55:56.795]  Klepper works for that.
[00:55:56.795 --> 00:55:59.978]  And Netflix.
[00:55:59.978 --> 00:56:06.304]  It's like the late night shows have said, yeah, Chuckie Schumer calls up and helps me write my lines.
[00:56:06.304 --> 00:56:06.925]  Seriously.
[00:56:06.925 --> 00:56:07.845]  Thank you, Chuck.
[00:56:07.845 --> 00:56:14.352]  They kiss these old globalist traitors who are on the ding dong of the shy coms.
[00:56:15.393 --> 00:56:17.238]  Ridin' there, wee-wee.
[00:56:17.238 --> 00:56:19.042]  Sorry, that's just true.
[00:56:19.042 --> 00:56:20.065]  When it fits, you gotta use it.
[00:56:20.065 --> 00:56:21.588]  I'm not a profane guy, but sometimes I am.
[00:56:22.991 --> 00:56:25.932]  It's just, these are flaming traitors!
[00:56:25.932 --> 00:56:34.855]  And the Clintons are like these rotting, dead cicada carcasses attached to the wall, and here's this Klepper guy, like, rubbing up against the wing.
[00:56:34.855 --> 00:56:36.435]  Oh, oh!
[00:56:36.435 --> 00:56:39.496]  You know, trying to create the new future with skeletons.
[00:56:39.496 --> 00:56:40.376]  Klepper!
[00:56:40.376 --> 00:56:43.497]  You're not going to hatch any new little goblins with Hillary.
[00:56:43.497 --> 00:56:46.818]  Or Bill, looking like a buzzard hanging over your shoulder.
[00:56:46.818 --> 00:56:50.680]  I mean, this, this is a joke!
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:51.660]  This is a joke!
[00:56:52.705 --> 00:56:55.066]  This is a joke!
[00:56:55.066 --> 00:57:08.169]  And he's going, oh, I couldn't believe the Clintons helped me launch my new show in a promo, because it's gonna be announced that they own your show.
[00:57:08.169 --> 00:57:10.890]  Which anybody could go research and find out.
[00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:12.531]  Like that.
[00:57:12.531 --> 00:57:20.013]  So now their billions and their foundation are a facelift for Crypt Keeper and his husband?
[00:57:22.413 --> 00:57:25.795]  That's the best you got?
[00:57:25.795 --> 00:57:33.358]  As if anyone wants to tune into Comedy Central and see the Clintons looking like Day of the Dead.
[00:57:33.358 --> 00:57:37.040]  At least have them eat somebody's brains, you might get ratings.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:44.524]  I mean, some little leftist lying nobody hanging out with two dead political operatives.
[00:57:44.524 --> 00:57:46.725]  When I say dead, I mean politically.
[00:57:50.911 --> 00:57:52.397]  Okay, it's true.
[00:57:52.397 --> 00:57:53.763]  I stayed up late last night so...

[00:59:53.322 --> 00:59:55.984]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:38.826 --> 01:00:55.401]  No, seriously, I didn't have time to listen to this whole podcast that's produced by the left and this new show and the Clintons getting into production at Viacom and Netflix with their billions of laundered drug money and child kidnapping money.
[01:00:55.401 --> 01:01:00.065]  It's come out in AP reports, the Clintons and the giant child smuggling operations out of Haiti.
[01:01:01.994 --> 01:01:30.243]  But, uh, getting back to what I was saying here, I've actually got, man, the footage of the interview he does with the Clintons, where Bill looks like a demonic buzzard that's like looking at a dead baby it's gonna eat or something, and Clinton's like hanging, and then Hillary just looks like a pumpkin-headed demon, and then here's this little trendy guy that, you know, signed on, he's an anointed one from the left, you know, to help take down Alex Jones,
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:38.643]  And then they're talking about, he's talking about how I need to be taken down and how I deserve what's happened to me.
[01:01:38.643 --> 01:01:55.571]  He's sitting there with mass murdering war criminals that put 10 times the sanctions on the Iraqis that George Herbert Walker did and killed over a million and a half of them, 500,000 of them being children.
[01:01:55.571 --> 01:01:59.774]  At Hillary and Bill's direction, and when they got asked about it, they said 500,000 is a good price to pay.
[01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:24.240]  So everyone should be thinking to themselves, every moment of every waking day, that you're not the tail end of the globalist, leftist, blue-blood, foundation-funded, weird, quasi-wannabe, Atlantic accent, British aristocracy.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.561]  Nothing against Brits.
[01:02:25.561 --> 01:02:27.082]  Hell, my mom is pretty much an Anglophile.
[01:02:27.082 --> 01:02:29.384]  And I know why.
[01:02:29.384 --> 01:02:31.225]  I mean, she's proud of her family lineage and all that.
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:39.342]  Not just Bangalore, but Saxon as well.
[01:02:39.342 --> 01:02:45.583]  But that system, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:54.765]  And the people that inherit all this power and all this wealth become insanely disconnected from reality.
[01:02:54.765 --> 01:02:58.526]  And that's why smart families
[01:03:01.256 --> 01:03:11.082]  In many cases, would just change their names, buy a ship, and set sail for the new world.
[01:03:11.082 --> 01:03:18.647]  And a lot of that went on too, but see, but the Clintons, they don't come from any powerful dynasties or any kings.
[01:03:18.647 --> 01:03:28.333]  They come from knuckle dragon psychopath stock that'll do whatever it's told at any time, any place.
[01:03:28.333 --> 01:03:29.954]  And again, you listen to this crap.
[01:03:31.431 --> 01:03:37.114]  It is mind-blowing.
[01:03:37.114 --> 01:03:46.159]  When I watched Hillary give a speech in New Hampshire or New York, those are the last two speeches.
[01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:53.003]  I watched some others too, but the last full speeches I watched, and it was sycophantic worship.
[01:03:55.387 --> 01:04:01.071]  Have you seen somebody announce at the UN and they read their whole name, and it's like 10 names, the Royal Highness of this and that?
[01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.232]  It sounds stupid.
[01:04:02.232 --> 01:04:12.420]  With her, it's shaking, and, oh, and she did this, and she did that, and she... Because she used to run the country, folks.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.042]  It wasn't Obama.
[01:04:15.042 --> 01:04:21.648]  And these people all sycophantically worship because she promised them they were going to run everything.
[01:04:21.648 --> 01:04:24.470]  They weren't just going to run the government, they were going to run you.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:32.302]  And Klepper and all these people were brought up that they're supposed to rule us.
[01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:33.782]  Dude, you ain't gonna rule nothing.
[01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:35.823]  You come from trash.
[01:04:35.823 --> 01:04:41.605]  I can take one look at you and tell you come from a bunch of mentally ill garbage.
[01:04:41.605 --> 01:04:44.065]  And that's where you're going back to, son.
[01:04:44.065 --> 01:04:45.486]  God's real, boy.
[01:04:45.486 --> 01:04:46.806]  You can't see it.
[01:04:46.806 --> 01:04:48.767]  So you keep making your jokes.
[01:04:48.767 --> 01:04:50.287]  But those that can see can see.
[01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:54.709]  I love seeing you sitting there with those two corpses.
[01:04:54.709 --> 01:04:55.949]  You fit right in, son.
[01:04:58.396 --> 01:05:10.185]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:05:10.185 --> 01:05:18.552]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[01:05:18.552 --> 01:05:22.695]  Well, thousands of years ago it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[01:05:23.536 --> 01:05:29.144]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.
[01:05:29.144 --> 01:05:30.265]  Literally.
[01:05:30.265 --> 01:05:40.980]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.721]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[01:05:43.721 --> 01:05:48.584]  It's 50% off right now at fullmorestore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[01:05:48.584 --> 01:05:51.445]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[01:05:51.445 --> 01:05:57.589]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[01:05:59.304 --> 01:06:00.885]  You've got it.
[01:06:00.885 --> 01:06:06.367]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:06.367 --> 01:06:10.769]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:10.769 --> 01:06:17.011]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:17.011 --> 01:06:20.333]  Are we seeing the earth?
[01:06:20.333 --> 01:06:22.934]  You've got it.
[01:06:22.934 --> 01:06:26.675]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[01:06:26.675 --> 01:06:28.236]  You've got it.
[01:06:41.338 --> 01:06:41.659]  Yeah.
[01:07:11.727 --> 01:07:12.448]  All right.
[01:07:12.448 --> 01:07:19.495]  Robert Barnes, who is one of my great lawyers, chief legal counsel in our fight against the globalists, a lot of big stuff coming up in the next few months.
[01:07:19.495 --> 01:07:21.096]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:07:21.096 --> 01:07:27.983]  He's going to be in studio starting next segment to cover all the international news, the national news, to take your calls.
[01:07:27.983 --> 01:07:30.465]  And I promise today we will open the phones up.
[01:07:31.386 --> 01:07:39.249]  And take your calls directly for Bob Barnes on any subject you want to raise, but the questions will be directed at him.
[01:07:39.249 --> 01:07:42.090]  That is coming up as well.
[01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:52.154]  But I want to give you my view on Jared Kushner.
[01:07:52.154 --> 01:07:57.797]  Now, here's how this works for me.
[01:07:57.797 --> 01:08:00.798]  I judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:08:03.891 --> 01:08:21.561]  And I've also always noticed that people that get involved in King's courts and in the subterfuge of access to a powerful person, it just goes from bad to worse.
[01:08:21.561 --> 01:08:25.283]  And so I've been sucked into those things when I'm not even wanting to be sucked into them.
[01:08:27.759 --> 01:08:39.287]  To the damage of my overall goal, just to promote freedom and awareness and decentralization and a pro-human future.
[01:08:39.287 --> 01:08:45.151]  But Jared Kushner is obviously smart.
[01:08:45.151 --> 01:08:48.374]  He's a good looking guy.
[01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:51.636]  He's Trump's son-in-law.
[01:08:51.636 --> 01:08:52.957]  I support Trump.
[01:08:52.957 --> 01:08:54.198]  I think Trump's smart.
[01:08:54.198 --> 01:08:55.619]  Trump needs people he can really trust.
[01:08:57.659 --> 01:09:02.082]  He trusts Jared?
[01:09:02.082 --> 01:09:06.765]  And so I don't have a problem with him having a national security clearance of the things he's doing.
[01:09:06.765 --> 01:09:13.729]  I mean, my God, the Communist Chinese ran the Obama administration, but oh, the left doesn't want Jared Kushner to have a security clearance.
[01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:16.431]  What does that tell you?
[01:09:16.431 --> 01:09:23.395]  But out in the whole right-wing-o-sphere, I've been hearing for three years, since he was president-elect,
[01:09:25.925 --> 01:09:33.708]  That Jared Kushner is just the worst thing since gonorrhea.
[01:09:33.708 --> 01:09:39.771]  But those are the same people that tell me Benjamin Netanyahu is the worst thing since death.
[01:09:39.771 --> 01:09:44.013]  I don't get involved in Israel's politics.
[01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:45.053]  I'm glad Israel's there.
[01:09:45.053 --> 01:09:48.615]  I mean, can you imagine if the Arabs were fighting over it?
[01:09:48.615 --> 01:09:49.355]  What would it be like?
[01:09:49.355 --> 01:09:51.976]  I mean, let's get real.
[01:09:51.976 --> 01:09:53.557]  But let's move away from that point.
[01:09:56.121 --> 01:10:02.207]  The Economist Magazine, owned by the leftist Rothschilds, wanted Netanyahu out.
[01:10:02.207 --> 01:10:05.151]  Works around the clock to remove him and Trump.
[01:10:05.151 --> 01:10:07.593]  Works around the clock to take me out.
[01:10:07.593 --> 01:10:10.436]  I don't look at the Rothschilds as Jewish.
[01:10:10.436 --> 01:10:13.539]  I look at them as evil opportunists that play people off.
[01:10:13.539 --> 01:10:16.683]  People say, well then why'd they help fund the founding of Israel?
[01:10:19.246 --> 01:10:27.249]  Because they knew it was already coming, and they wanted to try to control it, to parlay it into world government, which they now admit.
[01:10:27.249 --> 01:10:29.690]  And the Rothschilds aren't one monolithic group either.
[01:10:29.690 --> 01:10:31.311]  It's not fair to say that.
[01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:35.372]  But the ones running it are bad news.
[01:10:35.372 --> 01:10:36.933]  Bad news.
[01:10:36.933 --> 01:10:38.874]  Very bad news.
[01:10:38.874 --> 01:10:39.274]  Obviously.
[01:10:41.129 --> 01:10:45.772]  So all these leftist funded white supremacist groups, that's who funds them and runs them.
[01:10:45.772 --> 01:10:47.994]  Look at the left, it's all anti-semitic stuff.
[01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:55.259]  They like boil Jews down to just like they're robots or something.
[01:10:55.259 --> 01:10:59.342]  And that there's just one Jewish brain and Jews all think alike.
[01:10:59.342 --> 01:11:00.903]  That's not how families work.
[01:11:00.903 --> 01:11:07.028]  Whether you were German or Japanese or Nigerian, you got 10 people in the family, they don't all think alike.
[01:11:07.028 --> 01:11:07.288]  That's BS.
[01:11:09.707 --> 01:11:29.751]  So, I'm not defending Jared Kushner, I'm not attacking Jared Kushner, because I elected Trump, you elected Trump, Trump trusts him, and you've got to give the President that support because he's been trying hard and been delivering and doing things that are biblical, in my view.
[01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:30.911]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:34.292]  The attack on Trump's all you need to know, they are pissed.
[01:11:34.292 --> 01:11:38.813]  The establishment and their whole plan is really upset that he's going to fight all the stuff they've done.
[01:11:40.011 --> 01:11:48.855]  Now all that prefacing, I'm done talking about Kushner, and I'm going to try to explain this very, very simply, and I know that some of the detractors will take it out of context, but that doesn't matter.
[01:11:48.855 --> 01:11:56.899]  This is for people that want to hear what I really think, and this is my best analysis and what I know.
[01:11:56.899 --> 01:12:04.103]  We published, right when it came out, from their own site, the Bilderberg Group's itinerary, and who's going to be there, and who the guests are in Switzerland.
[01:12:05.828 --> 01:12:12.251]  When I was first covering this 20 years ago, they were saying in the news, I was insane it didn't exist.
[01:12:12.251 --> 01:12:15.812]  Even 10 years ago, they would say I was insane it didn't exist.
[01:12:15.812 --> 01:12:17.073]  You understand?
[01:12:17.073 --> 01:12:21.955]  So it was the fact that they were saying that world government meetings weren't happening.
[01:12:21.955 --> 01:12:24.296]  That was the issue.
[01:12:24.296 --> 01:12:30.579]  Jared Kushner announced he was going to Bilderberg.
[01:12:31.869 --> 01:12:38.012]  Then people, after getting flooded with calls and emails in the office, oh my God, Trump sold us out!
[01:12:38.012 --> 01:12:40.994]  Tushner's going to Bilderberg!
[01:12:40.994 --> 01:12:44.256]  I'm going to say this, I'm going to be very clear.
[01:12:44.256 --> 01:12:48.538]  I would go to Bilderberg if they asked me to go.
[01:12:48.538 --> 01:12:50.720]  What matters is what I stand for.
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.661]  We know Bilderberg was set up to bring in a world government.
[01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:58.004]  We know Bilderberg's one of the top globalist meetings that they denied existed at the Rockefeller Slam.
[01:12:58.933 --> 01:13:07.371]  It brought the Atlantic alliance of the Western elite in the United States with the Eastern Western elite after World War II.
[01:13:07.371 --> 01:13:08.413]  We know the history.
[01:13:08.413 --> 01:13:09.396]  I've made films about it.
[01:13:11.164 --> 01:13:15.326]  Going to a meeting is not being on the agenda.
[01:13:15.326 --> 01:13:26.392]  Just like when Trump goes to Davos, it's more powerful than Bilderberg now, it's public, and they're calling for world government, and they're all wearing their EU things, and he's wearing the American flag, and we go and push our agenda there.
[01:13:26.392 --> 01:13:35.256]  Just like Trump meeting with Kim Jong-un doesn't mean we agree with Kim Jong-un executing, you know, his ambassadors or his envoys.
[01:13:35.256 --> 01:13:40.439]  So it's a very simple thing for me
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.840]  To judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:14:07.047]  Now, if Jared Kushner came back from Bilderberg, or Davos, or any of these events, and Trump suddenly signed on to open borders, or signed on to globalism, or signed on to world government, or signed on to confiscating guns, or signed on to teaching five-year-olds, you know, how to be gay or whatever, which is what's pushed by the left so you don't have kids, then I'd go after Trump.
[01:14:07.047 --> 01:14:08.588]  In a split second.
[01:14:09.838 --> 01:14:11.299]  Split second.
[01:14:11.299 --> 01:14:12.439]  I'm not loyal to Trump.
[01:14:12.439 --> 01:14:20.422]  I'm loyal to justice, to my children, to God, to a future, a pro-human future.
[01:14:20.422 --> 01:14:22.223]  But the fact that we have
[01:14:24.784 --> 01:14:38.076]  A patriot president, all these other nationals getting elected and sweeping elections around the world for populist and now they've got to have a representative of Trump inside their confab is us seizing the flag.
[01:14:38.076 --> 01:14:47.684]  At least at the level of my vision, I see this in the continuum of what Trump's doing, what we're doing, what I'm doing, as victory.
[01:14:47.684 --> 01:14:49.566]  You know, when we took over Nazi Germany in 1945,
[01:14:52.256 --> 01:14:59.619]  And marched in to the Reich Chancellery, and our troops were in the Chancellery, were our troops for Hitler?
[01:14:59.619 --> 01:15:01.240]  You're like, well of course not.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:14.605]  When our football team, for the New England Patriots, and they drive down the field against the other team, and they get into their end zone, because they got in their end zone, are they for the other team?
[01:15:14.605 --> 01:15:16.846]  You're like, well of course not.
[01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:19.427]  We're taking over their end zone.
[01:15:20.404 --> 01:15:22.627]  We're taking over their right chancellery.
[01:15:22.627 --> 01:15:25.390]  We're taking over their command bases.
[01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:26.972]  We're on the march.
[01:15:26.972 --> 01:15:28.934]  The empire is on the run.
[01:15:28.934 --> 01:15:34.882]  Now, if I see anything out of Kushner or Trump,
[01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:39.351]  That's pissing on our sovereignty or our freedom, our values.
[01:15:39.351 --> 01:15:44.793]  I'll turn on them like a pit bull on PCP.
[01:15:44.793 --> 01:15:46.614]  But let me give you a little newsflash.
[01:15:46.614 --> 01:15:49.575]  It ain't gonna happen.
[01:15:49.575 --> 01:15:50.956]  It's not, folks.
[01:15:50.956 --> 01:15:51.716]  It's not.
[01:15:51.716 --> 01:15:54.377]  So, everybody should just relax.
[01:15:54.377 --> 01:15:56.278]  We're conquering Bilderberg right now.
[01:15:57.584 --> 01:15:58.825]  Maybe not today.
[01:15:58.825 --> 01:16:00.126]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:16:00.126 --> 01:16:03.869]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.869 --> 01:16:04.949]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.949 --> 01:16:06.771]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:08.492]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:16:27.065 --> 01:16:33.430]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:36.452]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.452 --> 01:16:42.396]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.396 --> 01:16:46.179]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.179 --> 01:16:47.439]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.439 --> 01:16:48.780]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:54.985]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:54.985 --> 01:16:56.426]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.367 --> 01:16:59.328]  Heart disease is on the rise.

[01:17:06.230 --> 01:17:14.593]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:17:47.257 --> 01:17:49.878]  The most banned network in the world.
[01:18:04.235 --> 01:18:06.177]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[01:18:06.177 --> 01:18:08.659]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:18:08.659 --> 01:18:09.619]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:18:09.619 --> 01:18:10.080]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.381]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:18:11.381 --> 01:18:13.463]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:18:13.463 --> 01:18:19.407]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[01:18:19.407 --> 01:18:21.349]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:18:21.349 --> 01:18:22.290]  God bless you, brother.
[01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:25.853]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[01:18:25.853 --> 01:18:28.695]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread
[01:18:29.315 --> 01:18:30.416]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:18:30.416 --> 01:18:32.738]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:18:32.738 --> 01:18:35.480]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:18:57.958 --> 01:19:07.244]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:19:07.244 --> 01:19:10.126]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:19:10.126 --> 01:19:16.170]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best eye out in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:23.093]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:19:23.093 --> 01:19:29.375]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:36.318]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:19:37.458 --> 01:19:39.078]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:15.048 --> 01:20:31.897]  Jared Kushner is in Switzerland right now.
[01:20:31.897 --> 01:20:36.679]  The articles are up on InfoWars.com with the full Bilderberg list.
[01:20:36.679 --> 01:20:39.020]  Has he sold out to the New World Order?
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.721]  Is he a traitor?
[01:20:40.721 --> 01:20:41.782]  Has Trump sold us out?
[01:20:44.352 --> 01:20:48.433]  You see the entire globalist program trying to destroy Trump.
[01:20:48.433 --> 01:20:51.654]  Representatives of the presidency always go to Bilderberg.
[01:20:51.654 --> 01:20:52.755]  This was set up by U.S.
[01:20:52.755 --> 01:20:56.956]  intelligence, was what was left of European intelligence after World War II.
[01:20:56.956 --> 01:21:02.098]  If I see Trump's policies change, and they're not America first, then I'll turn against the president.
[01:21:02.098 --> 01:21:03.698]  But I don't think that's happening.
[01:21:03.698 --> 01:21:05.019]  Going to a globalist meeting.
[01:21:06.243 --> 01:21:09.704]  And the fact that secret globalist meetings are now admitted.
[01:21:09.704 --> 01:21:16.406]  Mainstream media now has to report on the powerful secret world government Bilderberg policy meeting.
[01:21:16.406 --> 01:21:31.089]  When just ten years ago they said in the New York Times that I was in Chantilly, Virginia having a full-on, it said, Jones imagined men in sunglasses and SUVs following him.
[01:21:31.089 --> 01:21:34.170]  When they did a review of a movie that won first place at
[01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:40.383]  The local South by Southwest called New World Order.
[01:21:40.383 --> 01:21:42.123]  And the film was at Bilderberg.
[01:21:42.123 --> 01:21:43.804]  They showed us being thrown out of the hotel.
[01:21:43.804 --> 01:21:49.546]  But when the New York Times did a review, they said, we made it up.
[01:21:49.546 --> 01:21:52.687]  It doesn't exist.
[01:21:52.687 --> 01:21:54.707]  That was 2008.
[01:21:54.707 --> 01:21:59.089]  So I guess 11 years ago.
[01:21:59.089 --> 01:22:00.850]  How far have we come?
[01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:03.470]  That world government secret meetings are there.
[01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:04.931]  The Pope's called for world government.
[01:22:06.283 --> 01:22:08.264]  All of it's out in the open now.
[01:22:08.264 --> 01:22:10.865]  So the question isn't, is Jared Kushner there?
[01:22:10.865 --> 01:22:12.626]  We're conquering that.
[01:22:12.626 --> 01:22:15.888]  Kushner is Trump's representative.
[01:22:15.888 --> 01:22:18.009]  And so, Trump goes to Davos.
[01:22:18.009 --> 01:22:19.389]  That's public Bilderberg.
[01:22:19.389 --> 01:22:21.971]  And he pushes our agenda there.
[01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:23.651]  He goes with me to North Korea.
[01:22:23.651 --> 01:22:25.232]  He pushes our agenda there.
[01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:29.414]  What I care about is policy out of Trump.
[01:22:29.414 --> 01:22:30.455]  And he's not perfect.
[01:22:30.455 --> 01:22:32.436]  Ann Coulter's right.
[01:22:32.436 --> 01:22:34.557]  But it's because he doesn't have our support.
[01:22:35.418 --> 01:22:37.359]  But on so many fronts, he's doing a great job.
[01:22:37.359 --> 01:22:38.319]  That's why they hate him.
[01:22:38.319 --> 01:22:40.080]  So it isn't a defense of Trump that I'm defending.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.221]  It's a defense of, can you imagine if Hillary was in full power?
[01:22:45.221 --> 01:22:47.502]  Because she's still partially in power.
[01:22:47.502 --> 01:22:58.326]  Buying into Viacom, buying into Netflix, buying into production companies, meeting with people that do whole TV shows nightly about me, Jordan Klepper, about how to bring me down.
[01:22:58.326 --> 01:23:00.586]  He does interviews talking about it.
[01:23:00.586 --> 01:23:02.627]  It's unbelievable!
[01:23:04.088 --> 01:23:06.609]  All right, let's shift gears.
[01:23:06.609 --> 01:23:14.013]  Constitutional lawyer and famous civil rights lawyer as well, one of the top lawyers in the country with one of the most winning records.
[01:23:14.013 --> 01:23:16.394]  Robert Barnes is here, also does some work for InfoWars.
[01:23:16.394 --> 01:23:19.895]  He's in town the next four or five days, so we're lucky to have him here with us.
[01:23:19.895 --> 01:23:21.736]  We'll open the phones up next hour.
[01:23:21.736 --> 01:23:23.277]  You were sitting here during the break a few minutes ago.
[01:23:23.277 --> 01:23:24.157]  I said, what do you want to cover first?
[01:23:24.157 --> 01:23:24.918]  You said North Korea.
[01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:29.534]  I said, excellent, because that's what I want to get into first with you.
[01:23:29.534 --> 01:23:32.659]  You've got a very interesting take on Kim Jong Un.
[01:23:32.659 --> 01:23:34.501]  You asked me, you said, what is your take?
[01:23:34.501 --> 01:23:35.402]  And I said, a reset.
[01:23:35.402 --> 01:23:36.684]  You said, precisely.
[01:23:36.684 --> 01:23:38.727]  Yeah, exactly, precisely.
[01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:41.911]  So what happened here is that you have, I think the president has read
[01:23:42.452 --> 01:23:53.659]  Kim exceptionally well and understands the North Korea dynamic and is creating the first real predicate for peace that has been established with North Korea since North Korea was created as a separate independent nation.
[01:23:53.659 --> 01:23:54.860]  He's ending the status quo.
[01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:56.881]  We know 60 years of this ain't worth it.
[01:23:56.881 --> 01:23:57.321]  Exactly.
[01:23:57.321 --> 01:24:08.048]  And what he's done is he's decided, now this is not the happiest or healthiest mechanism of dealing with a failed peace conference, is to kill and imprison everybody who he blames for it.
[01:24:08.388 --> 01:24:20.453]  But what he's doing is he's establishing that he wants it to go forward, that he does not blame the President, that he wants the President's agenda, and he blames his people for not achieving that agenda of the peace and detente that the President's called for.
[01:24:20.453 --> 01:24:23.475]  And then Trump signals he may get rid of Bolton, which is another signal.
[01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:24.355]  Absolutely.
[01:24:24.355 --> 01:24:26.296]  It's all face-saving.
[01:24:26.296 --> 01:24:27.496]  Right, exactly.
[01:24:27.496 --> 01:24:30.858]  It's just the North Korea form of face-saving is not the most ideal form of face-saving.
[01:24:31.518 --> 01:24:32.999]  But it's the North Korean model.
[01:24:32.999 --> 01:24:35.480]  So, you know, I don't know if they have any other way to do it.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:47.364]  Well, he put his uncle in a forced labor camp for not getting the midnight... He basically agreed, but the guy slept on it, didn't deliver, that Kim had backed off and capitulated.
[01:24:47.364 --> 01:24:53.026]  And that's why Kim, and I'm not defending Kim, he's a horrible psychopath, but the bloodbath gets.
[01:24:53.026 --> 01:24:54.627]  China's had a bunch of wars with South Korea.
[01:24:55.447 --> 01:24:57.188]  The little vampire bat knows.
[01:24:57.188 --> 01:25:03.012]  They try to keep them poor under their control as an excuse for destabilization in that entire region.
[01:25:03.012 --> 01:25:11.278]  If North Korea just works with Japan and the US and South Korea, they can be like South Korea, the most prosperous country, you know, per square mile in the world.
[01:25:11.278 --> 01:25:12.198]  So he gets it.
[01:25:12.198 --> 01:25:14.300]  He was, you know, raised in the West, raised in Switzerland.
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:15.380]  He wants to do this.
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:16.661]  He likes Trump.
[01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:22.365]  And so he understands that there's double dealing by his own ministers when he said, oh, they sold out to America.
[01:25:22.365 --> 01:25:24.627]  No, it really means they're sabotaging for China.
[01:25:24.627 --> 01:25:25.087]  Exactly.
[01:25:25.407 --> 01:25:27.328]  I think Trump has a short play and a long play.
[01:25:27.328 --> 01:25:34.911]  And the short play is to have peace and a meaningful detente with North Korea so it's no longer a threat to either America or the world.
[01:25:34.911 --> 01:25:46.656]  But the long play is to remove North Korea as a tool of the Chinese to threaten the world so that they can have their trade advantages and economic advantages and slowly but surely dominate the rest of the world through their economic edge.
[01:25:46.656 --> 01:25:47.716]  And so the president wants to
[01:25:49.557 --> 01:25:55.262]  Well, more than anything else, he wants to prevent China from being the next economic engine that dominates the world at the expense of China.
[01:25:55.262 --> 01:25:56.483]  This is all about China?
[01:25:56.483 --> 01:25:57.044]  Absolutely.
[01:25:57.044 --> 01:26:04.791]  And the toilet bowl plunger, or the stopper in the sink you pull out to sink the Chai comms, is North Korea?
[01:26:05.331 --> 01:26:05.851]  Exactly.
[01:26:05.851 --> 01:26:08.952]  I mean, China has cost us more manufacturing jobs than any other part of the country.
[01:26:08.952 --> 01:26:16.755]  And the globalist traders have been propping up North Korea, propping up China, and Trump and the patriots that are in the Pentagon know that's the strategic target.
[01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:19.716]  So the only way we lose is by not doing this.
[01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:27.238]  Kim just wants to make sure that Trump's strong enough that you'll never have freedom there, but you'll at least have wealth and the people not starving to death.
[01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:29.408]  Kim wants the money.
[01:26:29.408 --> 01:26:30.269]  He wants the power.
[01:26:30.269 --> 01:26:31.431]  He wants the resorts.
[01:26:31.431 --> 01:26:32.973]  He wants the factories.
[01:26:32.973 --> 01:26:34.616]  And Trump's like, I'll give it to you.
[01:26:34.616 --> 01:26:35.958]  China would never do it.
[01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:42.047]  We actually invade countries, take them over, and then set them free, like South Korea and Japan.
[01:26:42.047 --> 01:26:43.208]  The Chai Koms never do that.
[01:26:43.769 --> 01:26:44.930]  America does do that.
[01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:46.813]  Now, do you trust me or do you trust them?
[01:26:46.813 --> 01:26:48.294]  And he's in this flux.
[01:26:48.294 --> 01:26:58.605]  But I think the execution of the guys that were obviously working for the CHICOMS is a signal that he understands that and is setting a reset that if you don't actually really negotiate, I'm going to kill you.
[01:26:58.605 --> 01:27:01.669]  Which I'm not defending, but it shows the level of brinksmanship.
[01:27:01.909 --> 01:27:02.850]  Yeah, no doubt about it.
[01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:08.293]  And I think he recognizes that China is a greater threat than an ally for North Korea's long-term future.
[01:27:08.293 --> 01:27:12.496]  That China has no interest in North Korea ever being economically independent.
[01:27:12.496 --> 01:27:16.859]  That China has no interest in North Korea being a peace-oriented country.
[01:27:16.859 --> 01:27:20.281]  Because that removes them as a tool and as a threat to the rest of the world.
[01:27:20.281 --> 01:27:23.603]  And again, China believes it's supposed to rule the world for 5,000 years, as you said.
[01:27:23.603 --> 01:27:28.587]  And Greater China, as they call it, they think North Korea and South Korea is Greater China.
[01:27:28.587 --> 01:27:30.328]  They think Vietnam is Greater China.
[01:27:30.328 --> 01:27:31.809]  They think the Philippines is Greater China.
[01:27:32.029 --> 01:27:34.111]  Exactly, and not only is it part of their sort of imperial expansion.
[01:27:34.111 --> 01:27:36.773]  And Trump's like, I won't invade you, I'll just throw billions at you.
[01:27:36.773 --> 01:27:37.434]  Exactly.
[01:27:37.434 --> 01:27:46.522]  And his point is that he's different than past presidents, that he can be trusted and relied upon because his opposition to Chinese domination is more important than controlling North Korea's future.
[01:27:46.522 --> 01:27:50.846]  And that he's willing to give up controlling North Korea's future as long as North Korea gives up threatening the world.
[01:27:50.846 --> 01:27:58.353]  And you know North Korea after 60 plus years literally being the rape meat of the Chai Koms, they want to leave the Chai Koms.
[01:27:58.553 --> 01:27:58.993]  Absolutely.
[01:27:58.993 --> 01:28:04.937]  I mean, they've created a codependent relationship between North Korea and China that is only healthy for China, not healthy for North Korea.
[01:28:04.937 --> 01:28:10.081]  And I think he's recognizing that, realizing that, acting on it, and it was Trump's genius to know that he could drive a wedge.
[01:28:10.081 --> 01:28:18.426]  And the same way that Nixon knew he could drive a wedge between the Communist Empire by separating China from the Soviet Union in the 1970s, Trump is doing the same thing all over again.
[01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:26.492]  And he's taking it to remove China's true tool of oppression, which is using the North Korean threat to maintain its economic dominance.
[01:28:26.492 --> 01:28:28.193]  And the only reason the wedge is real is
[01:28:28.833 --> 01:28:30.134]  Trump does what he says.
[01:28:30.134 --> 01:28:32.495]  It's square dealing.
[01:28:32.495 --> 01:28:35.977]  They call it almost OCD, that what Trump says is what is going to happen.
[01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:43.381]  And people don't realize, whenever Trump starts increasing tariffs on China or doing other things anti-China, he's helping the peace process in North Korea.
[01:28:43.381 --> 01:28:50.205]  Because he's sending the message to North Korea that he's sincerely more focused on China than them, and he's willing to cut a deal for peace for the world to do so.
[01:28:50.205 --> 01:28:52.086]  And he just cut some of the sanctions on North Korea.
[01:28:52.086 --> 01:28:52.666]  He's showing them.
[01:28:52.666 --> 01:28:54.827]  It's like, listen, don't be a moron.
[01:28:54.827 --> 01:28:55.788]  Take this deal.
[01:28:55.788 --> 01:28:56.068]  God.
[01:28:57.444 --> 01:28:58.966]  Oh, these pains.
[01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:01.509]  My neck, my back, shoulders.
[01:29:01.509 --> 01:29:03.311]  I've got to get some relief.
[01:29:03.311 --> 01:29:09.018]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[01:29:09.018 --> 01:29:10.900]  But you don't want to take another pill.
[01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:12.882]  There's an easier, healthier way, right?

[01:29:19.230 --> 01:29:20.712]  Oh, not just pillows.

[01:30:16.699 --> 01:30:26.785]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[01:30:37.491 --> 01:30:38.651]  You must experience it.
[01:30:38.651 --> 01:30:45.634]  It is a total game changer and it comes in easy to use packets to mix it with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:30:45.634 --> 01:30:47.154]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:30:47.154 --> 01:30:48.635]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:30:48.635 --> 01:30:55.337]  So take a half pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.

[01:31:00.279 --> 01:31:02.141]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:31:02.141 --> 01:31:03.021]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[01:31:03.021 --> 01:31:04.382]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:31:04.382 --> 01:31:05.904]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:31:05.904 --> 01:31:06.684]  I'm so excited.
[01:31:06.684 --> 01:31:07.605]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:31:07.605 --> 01:31:10.087]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[01:31:10.087 --> 01:31:12.589]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[01:31:12.589 --> 01:31:14.010]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:14.010 --> 01:31:15.451]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:15.451 --> 01:31:16.873]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:16.873 --> 01:31:18.094]  The Bone Broth.
[01:31:18.094 --> 01:31:22.857]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:31:22.857 --> 01:31:24.018]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:24.018 --> 01:31:25.460]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.241]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[01:31:27.241 --> 01:31:28.002]  Like good.
[01:31:28.922 --> 01:31:30.644]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:30.644 --> 01:31:35.148]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride 3 Toothpaste.
[01:31:35.148 --> 01:31:38.631]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[01:31:38.631 --> 01:31:40.653]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[01:31:40.653 --> 01:31:43.215]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[01:31:43.215 --> 01:31:43.975]  I'm thanking you.
[01:31:43.975 --> 01:31:50.421]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[01:31:50.421 --> 01:31:51.242]  It is next level.
[01:31:51.242 --> 01:31:51.822]  It really is good.
[01:31:51.822 --> 01:31:52.363]  So thank you.
[01:31:52.363 --> 01:31:54.304]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:54.304 --> 01:31:54.665]  Thank you.

[01:33:01.366 --> 01:33:18.856]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:18.856 --> 01:33:23.298]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news.
[01:33:23.298 --> 01:33:26.540]  Coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:34.505 --> 01:33:42.509]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:33:42.509 --> 01:33:55.596]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:33:57.077 --> 01:34:00.859]  Trans-dimensionally over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[01:34:00.859 --> 01:34:05.202]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:34:05.202 --> 01:34:07.324]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[01:34:09.997 --> 01:34:16.782]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[01:34:16.782 --> 01:34:23.307]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[01:34:23.307 --> 01:34:25.329]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[01:34:25.329 --> 01:34:26.310]  It's fulfilling.
[01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:27.411]  InfoWars.
[01:34:27.411 --> 01:34:28.612]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:34:28.612 --> 01:34:28.912]  Today.
[01:34:37.162 --> 01:34:40.243]  Alright, Robert Barnes riding shotgun with us.
[01:34:40.243 --> 01:34:55.745]  We're going to look at the globalist attempt to murder the memory of abolitionists, of Christians, and of Martin Luther King, the attempt to demonize him, and group invites white women to voluntarily attend race-shaming dinners.
[01:34:55.745 --> 01:34:58.486]  That's on newswars.com.
[01:34:58.486 --> 01:34:59.386]  Very important article.
[01:34:59.386 --> 01:35:01.166]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:35:01.166 --> 01:35:02.607]  It's the next thing Bob wanted to get into.
[01:35:02.607 --> 01:35:03.647]  That was on my list.
[01:35:04.755 --> 01:35:06.075]  Come on, I've opened phones next hour.
[01:35:06.075 --> 01:35:09.836]  But first, I just did a little Buck Rogers intro that one of the crew put together.
[01:35:09.836 --> 01:35:13.357]  I guess Millie Weaver's husband, Gavin, put together.
[01:35:13.357 --> 01:35:25.761]  Because I was just at a local t-shirt shop six months ago, and I bought a t-shirt that showed the space shuttle blasting off into space.
[01:35:25.761 --> 01:35:30.522]  And I happened to wear that on Joe Rogan's podcast, and people just talked about the shirt everywhere.
[01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:32.723]  All these websites got started selling the shirt.
[01:35:34.056 --> 01:35:38.199]  Because it's a NASA patch, so it's copyright free, it's government.
[01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:43.163]  But I had it redone where it says Space Force.
[01:35:43.163 --> 01:35:45.744]  And we made the shuttle a little bit more high-tech looking.
[01:35:45.744 --> 01:35:52.129]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course.
[01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:56.852]  And it's got a red, white, and blue American flag on the right shoulder with Infowars.com.
[01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:02.294]  We've had a few shirts that have been hits over the years that really go viral, that signify.
[01:36:02.294 --> 01:36:04.055]  I believe this is going to be the new shirt.
[01:36:04.055 --> 01:36:11.299]  Now, the 18-wheeler, printed, produced, made in America, arrives next Wednesday.
[01:36:11.299 --> 01:36:13.361]  But I want to do some fanfare on this shirt.
[01:36:13.361 --> 01:36:16.342]  I believe this is going to be the next Hillary for Prison shirt.
[01:36:16.342 --> 01:36:18.644]  But it's about a pro-human future.
[01:36:18.644 --> 01:36:21.025]  It's about humanity going to the stars.
[01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:22.486]  It's about believing in
[01:36:23.749 --> 01:36:25.789]  The amazing gifts that God's given us.
[01:36:25.789 --> 01:36:29.050]  We're not gods, we're not gonna be gods, but we're made in the image of God.
[01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:30.391]  So we're a reflection.
[01:36:30.391 --> 01:36:31.731]  So we can do some amazing things.
[01:36:31.731 --> 01:36:33.891]  We're master builders.
[01:36:33.891 --> 01:36:40.313]  And the space shuttle's 1930s technology put into function in the late 1970s, retired five years ago.
[01:36:40.313 --> 01:36:42.173]  And so, we've redone it.
[01:36:42.173 --> 01:36:51.175]  I also had people on the street love the shirt, but a few have gone, why are you wearing that gay rainbow flag?
[01:36:51.175 --> 01:36:53.116]  And that's when I decided a few months ago to make the shirt.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:37:03.843]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sick of leftist groups or whoever expropriating or appropriating symbols.
[01:37:03.843 --> 01:37:09.144]  A, if you're a homosexual and you're not doing illegal stuff, I don't care what you do in your bedroom.
[01:37:09.144 --> 01:37:11.825]  That's the left claiming the conservatives are obsessed with what you're doing.
[01:37:11.825 --> 01:37:14.906]  Just leave kids alone with your heterosexual, homosexual.
[01:37:14.906 --> 01:37:16.507]  Plus, it's not a
[01:37:17.813 --> 01:37:18.614]  Classic rainbow.
[01:37:18.614 --> 01:37:20.756]  It's supposed to be the atmosphere.
[01:37:20.756 --> 01:37:28.045]  Anybody that knows, that's why NASA created this, low in the atmosphere is more dust and stuff than a spectrometer or in a telescope it's red.
[01:37:29.804 --> 01:37:31.225]  And as you get higher, it's orange.
[01:37:31.225 --> 01:37:37.550]  That's why the sun on the horizon is red, because you're looking through hundreds of miles of atmosphere, not just a few miles of atmosphere.
[01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:43.795]  So clear sky is black, below that is blue, then it's yellow, then it's orange, then it's red.
[01:37:43.795 --> 01:37:50.180]  That's why out of thousands of space shuttle patches, they've got thousands, it took me days to actually find the original patch.
[01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:52.022]  So this is a copy of the original patch.
[01:37:52.022 --> 01:37:53.203]  We put Space Force on it.
[01:37:53.963 --> 01:37:56.303]  And established 2020.
[01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:57.684]  American flag on the side.
[01:37:57.684 --> 01:37:59.064]  I designed this shirt.
[01:37:59.064 --> 01:38:00.844]  I'm very proud of this shirt.
[01:38:00.844 --> 01:38:02.585]  And maybe I'm wrong.
[01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:06.445]  But when I think it's a Zeitgeist, it tends to be a Zeitgeist.
[01:38:06.445 --> 01:38:10.026]  I've had other shirts, hundreds of thousands of which have been put on the street.
[01:38:10.026 --> 01:38:11.486]  And it's helped fund our operation as well.
[01:38:11.486 --> 01:38:14.067]  But this shirt has such nice fabric.
[01:38:14.067 --> 01:38:16.067]  It's made in America, all of it.
[01:38:16.067 --> 01:38:19.768]  That it cost us $10 a shirt.
[01:38:19.768 --> 01:38:21.368]  I did a huge order and got it down from $13.
[01:38:23.285 --> 01:38:23.525]  This is a
[01:38:41.363 --> 01:38:44.564]  I mean, we're wearing a Trump shirt, InfoWars shirt, and people still love those and wear them.
[01:38:44.564 --> 01:38:45.685]  But what about a Space Force?
[01:38:45.685 --> 01:38:53.148]  What about loving technology and what we built and having a pro-human future in space and the American flag that triggers so many?
[01:38:53.148 --> 01:38:55.309]  And a little InfoWars.com.
[01:38:55.309 --> 01:38:57.670]  I think this is the shirt, so pre-order.
[01:38:57.670 --> 01:38:59.511]  I never do pre-orders on T-shirts.
[01:38:59.511 --> 01:39:00.331]  We'll have it next week.
[01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:04.193]  It'll be shipped out by the end of the week, but get your order first.
[01:39:04.193 --> 01:39:06.754]  InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, or AAA2533139.
[01:39:06.754 --> 01:39:07.715]  And then lastly, don't forget,
[01:39:12.045 --> 01:39:17.108]  We're having Memorial Week sales that have to end this weekend.
[01:39:17.108 --> 01:39:24.933]  We have some of our best-selling products at 60% off, 40 to 60% off across the board.
[01:39:24.933 --> 01:39:29.896]  And I just never spend time telling you about these specials, but this is how we fund ourselves.
[01:39:29.896 --> 01:39:32.037]  And I really appreciate everybody that has been funding us.
[01:39:32.037 --> 01:39:32.997]  You're incredible.
[01:39:32.997 --> 01:39:38.821]  But it's the last days of the Memorial Week mega sale, which probably changed the graphic to say that that's my fault.
[01:39:40.299 --> 01:39:42.961]  But we have so many new big deals.
[01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:46.183]  60% off ExtendoWise and MycoZX Plus.
[01:39:46.183 --> 01:39:49.225]  50% off the new 8-pack PowerStack.
[01:39:49.225 --> 01:39:54.609]  50% off BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Ultimate Bone Broth, Super Metal Vitality.
[01:39:54.609 --> 01:39:55.029]  40% off TurboForce.
[01:39:57.811 --> 01:39:58.111]  I don't
[01:40:17.425 --> 01:40:26.510]  Robert Barnes, I've only known him, I've seen him on TV for decades and interviewed some of the guys involved in lawsuits with him many years ago, the Wesley Slipes lawyer, you name it.
[01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:31.313]  But just quantifying, before we go to break, what would you call this historic time we're in right now?
[01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:36.533]  Well, it's a time of revolution and it's a time of, it's sort of a crossroads time.
[01:40:36.533 --> 01:40:47.721]  So it's a time where we are either going to restore sort of the American Revolution and its original principles and reinforce those original principles, or we are going to abandon them.
[01:40:47.721 --> 01:40:48.761]  We're going to walk away from them.
[01:40:48.761 --> 01:40:49.422]  We're going to lose them.
[01:40:49.862 --> 01:41:00.326]  So we have basically, not only economically, is there a US-China competition to dominate manufacturing in the world, there's an idea competition between the US model and the Chinese model.
[01:41:00.326 --> 01:41:02.607]  And the Chinese model is a statist model.
[01:41:02.607 --> 01:41:13.691]  It's a combined corporatist-communist model that's driven by the state, that allows for a certain kind of private enterprise, but only the state-approved, state-sanctioned one that promotes state ideas.
[01:41:14.051 --> 01:41:14.131]  Yes.
[01:41:33.217 --> 01:41:33.577]  We're good to go.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:42:08.954]  So what's happened is we're competing with not only the Chinese economic model to decimate American manufacturing, to decimate American coal mining, to decimate other areas of American industry, and control over the manufacturing resources for the world, which can impact defense when you're talking about steel, when you're talking about... I want to hit this first when we come back, because you're too informed.
[01:42:08.954 --> 01:42:11.917]  Now people understand, the CHAICOMS and the Saudi Arabians,
[01:42:12.797 --> 01:42:14.618]  Fund killing our coal.
[01:42:14.618 --> 01:42:17.060]  Because we've got enough coal for 2,000 years.
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:18.280]  It's totally clean.
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.683]  People don't get why we can't have pipelines, but everybody else can.
[01:42:21.683 --> 01:42:22.743]  They don't get why we can't.
[01:42:22.743 --> 01:42:28.567]  Because foreign authoritarian regimes have used our openness to sell us out.
[01:42:28.567 --> 01:42:29.807]  So what Robert Barnes is saying is...
[01:42:31.221 --> 01:42:36.623]  It's even in BuzzFeed now that China's running our universities and that Obama let them do it.
[01:42:36.623 --> 01:42:38.383]  Trump's rolling that all up.
[01:42:38.383 --> 01:42:41.204]  And so what he's saying is, America isn't perfect.
[01:42:41.204 --> 01:42:43.845]  I used to get annoyed by American flag worship.
[01:42:43.845 --> 01:42:48.406]  I loved America, but I was like, that's kind of, you know, like an idol.
[01:42:48.406 --> 01:42:56.128]  Until you go, wait a minute, we have to idolize something that's a better system when it's what we've got instead of what they're about to override us with.
[01:42:57.645 --> 01:43:08.731]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[01:43:08.731 --> 01:43:17.576]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[01:43:17.576 --> 01:43:21.579]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[01:43:22.259 --> 01:43:28.724]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[01:43:28.724 --> 01:43:30.905]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
[01:43:30.905 --> 01:43:36.850]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy-Powder.
[01:43:36.850 --> 01:43:39.412]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[01:43:40.092 --> 01:43:50.499]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, OxyPowder from InfowarsStore.com will clear it out, guaranteed.
[01:43:50.499 --> 01:43:58.224]  So go to InfowarsStore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with OxyPowder.
[01:43:58.224 --> 01:44:04.709]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history.
[01:44:05.612 --> 01:44:09.875]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[01:44:09.875 --> 01:44:13.598]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[01:44:19.244 --> 01:44:20.965]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:44:20.965 --> 01:44:22.185]  This is racketeering.
[01:44:22.185 --> 01:44:23.305]  This is cartels.
[01:44:23.305 --> 01:44:25.706]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:44:25.706 --> 01:44:27.587]  We need it now.
[01:44:27.587 --> 01:44:29.288]  You can take on Big Ted.
[01:44:29.288 --> 01:44:38.231]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:46.274]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:44:46.274 --> 01:44:47.134]  The way to fight back
[01:44:47.774 --> 01:44:52.627]  ...is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[01:44:52.627 --> 01:44:56.397]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[01:44:58.570 --> 01:45:05.717]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[01:46:01.506 --> 01:46:03.047]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.432 --> 01:46:07.395]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[01:47:00.754 --> 01:47:03.377]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.986 --> 01:47:34.388]  Monday through Friday, the most banned, demonized, lied-about broadcast in the world is live.
[01:47:34.388 --> 01:47:41.070]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I'm just a common sense guy that loves America and loves freedom and loves you.
[01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:44.892]  I don't see you winning as me losing.
[01:47:44.892 --> 01:47:48.393]  I see it as a non-zero-sum game, an expanding pie.
[01:47:48.393 --> 01:47:51.554]  But the sociopaths that run the planet, they do see it as that.
[01:47:51.554 --> 01:47:52.174]  Now, Robert Barnes,
[01:47:53.871 --> 01:48:04.162]  You're a famous civil rights lawyer that actually goes out when the cops do the wrong thing or whatever and goes after them, but you pointed out that the whole modern thing is about creating division.
[01:48:04.162 --> 01:48:07.466]  It's not about actually stopping institutional corruption or racism.
[01:48:07.466 --> 01:48:13.393]  It's actually causing it to flower, which is what the system admits in WikiLeaks from Hillary, is what they want.
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:27.143]  You this morning, before you came on, an hour before you came on, we were having a meeting this morning about who we're getting ready to sue, and it's a long list, and we don't want to do this, but we have to, folks, for the First Amendment.
[01:48:27.143 --> 01:48:29.204]  It's just the right thing to do, so thanks for your support.
[01:48:29.204 --> 01:48:32.205]  Only you and power is like to have the force to do this.
[01:48:34.261 --> 01:48:40.562]  You wanted to get into a NewsWars.com article that's also on Infowars.com that people should really spread.
[01:48:40.562 --> 01:48:45.823]  Groups invite white women to voluntarily attend race-shaming dinners.
[01:48:45.823 --> 01:48:53.945]  And we'll get this in a few minutes and show for TV viewers the actual graphics, the videos of a black woman crying.
[01:48:53.945 --> 01:48:59.926]  The idea that you never committed this crime and black folks are fighting to get into this country from all over the world.
[01:49:00.868 --> 01:49:03.551]  But you are inherently bad because you're white.
[01:49:03.551 --> 01:49:07.576]  That is the essence of prejudging someone.
[01:49:07.576 --> 01:49:09.038]  The essence of racism.
[01:49:09.038 --> 01:49:13.643]  And Martin Luther King saying, don't judge somebody by the color of their skin, but the character of their deeds.
[01:49:13.643 --> 01:49:14.884]  That flies in the face of it.
[01:49:14.884 --> 01:49:16.426]  But it wasn't Martin Luther King who first said that.
[01:49:16.426 --> 01:49:17.227]  It was the Bible.
[01:49:17.227 --> 01:49:18.108]  Judge Treebots fruits.
[01:49:19.284 --> 01:49:20.824]  So you wanted to get into this.
[01:49:20.824 --> 01:49:29.646]  We've always heard about these FBI tapes and COINTELPRO of Martin Luther King having sex with women.
[01:49:29.646 --> 01:49:35.567]  And then maybe they say he made a joke when somebody said that some woman claimed he raped him.
[01:49:35.567 --> 01:49:36.508]  There's no tape.
[01:49:36.508 --> 01:49:37.388]  There's no release.
[01:49:37.388 --> 01:49:38.928]  There's no nothing.
[01:49:38.928 --> 01:49:41.289]  The point is we saw this with Kavanaugh.
[01:49:41.289 --> 01:49:43.909]  They admitted that was all fake.
[01:49:43.909 --> 01:49:47.550]  So why would the left that's always defended Martin Luther King
[01:49:49.417 --> 01:49:51.358]  Now they're totally taking over.
[01:49:51.358 --> 01:49:55.161]  Suddenly say, and they're taking it down at universities and everywhere.
[01:49:55.161 --> 01:50:01.065]  I mean, this is sick and it ties into this model where they get you to go denounce yourself.
[01:50:02.512 --> 01:50:04.895]  And you declare you're a racist, and then where that leads.
[01:50:04.895 --> 01:50:06.637]  So this is very sophisticated.
[01:50:06.637 --> 01:50:08.359]  It has a lot of facets.
[01:50:08.359 --> 01:50:09.320]  But let's get into it.
[01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:09.760]  Absolutely.
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.806]  So the church that they're actually showing at right here is Martin Luther King's last ever speech.
[01:50:14.806 --> 01:50:15.627]  It was there in Memphis.
[01:50:15.627 --> 01:50:20.493]  I was actually in that church for the commemoration of his speech for the opening of the Civil Rights Museum.
[01:50:20.493 --> 01:50:21.454]  You're from Tennessee.
[01:50:21.454 --> 01:50:22.095]  I'm from Tennessee.
[01:50:22.876 --> 01:50:31.884]  At the Lorraine Motel, which they brilliantly converted the scene of his assassination into a memorial recognizing his life, recognizing his history, recognizing his reputation.
[01:50:31.884 --> 01:50:36.988]  As a kid, I bought all of his speeches on little tapes, audio tapes, that I would listen to all the time.
[01:50:36.988 --> 01:50:41.312]  So this is what's unique about Martin Luther King, was that he was a racial unifier.
[01:50:41.312 --> 01:50:45.516]  That his appeal to civil rights wasn't based on, hey, I'm black, give me civil rights.
[01:50:45.516 --> 01:50:46.597]  It was, I'm an American.
[01:50:46.597 --> 01:50:47.878]  And that's the real reason that killed him.
[01:50:48.238 --> 01:50:48.999]  Absolutely.
[01:50:48.999 --> 01:50:56.223]  So he was such a unifying figure across classes, across races, and he was appealing to the deepest part of Americana.
[01:50:56.223 --> 01:50:58.565]  He didn't say give me rights because I came from Africa.
[01:50:58.565 --> 01:51:00.827]  He didn't say give me rights because I was once a slave.
[01:51:00.827 --> 01:51:04.129]  He didn't say give me rights because I had these bad things happen to me in the past.
[01:51:04.129 --> 01:51:06.350]  He said give me rights because I'm an American.
[01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:09.853]  And as an American, we should all have the same rights and be treated equally.
[01:51:09.853 --> 01:51:13.195]  Let me sit where I want to sit, eat where I want to eat, drink where I want to drink.
[01:51:13.195 --> 01:51:15.036]  Do that because I'm an American.
[01:51:15.036 --> 01:51:17.177]  And that's a unifying message.
[01:51:17.177 --> 01:51:17.778]  And nobody
[01:51:18.759 --> 01:51:20.720]  That any values could disagree with that?
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:21.301]  Absolutely!
[01:51:21.301 --> 01:51:24.083]  Nobody who deeply loves America could disagree with that.
[01:51:24.083 --> 01:51:33.230]  Now, for those people who don't like America and don't want an appeal to a unifying message, that's why first they started attacking King by saying, well, you know, he said things on gay rights that we don't agree with.
[01:51:33.230 --> 01:51:37.073]  Well, Martin Luther King was deeply rooted in the evangelical Christian... He was a Republican!
[01:51:37.073 --> 01:51:38.535]  In essence, he was.
[01:51:38.535 --> 01:51:43.699]  He was politically, historically, but also his ideology was rooted in a deep humanitarianism.
[01:51:44.119 --> 01:51:46.120]  So it was to be appealed.
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:49.741]  His Poor People's March was for poor people all across the world.
[01:51:49.741 --> 01:51:54.764]  It didn't limit itself to any particular group by color or by gender or by sexual orientation.
[01:51:54.764 --> 01:51:57.024]  But that was their first attack and they didn't go anywhere.
[01:51:57.024 --> 01:52:00.466]  So their next level of attack... I mean, ask yourself, these tapes and information...
[01:52:00.646 --> 01:52:04.110]  The left is openly trying to discredit Martin Luther King.
[01:52:04.110 --> 01:52:04.631]  Exactly.
[01:52:04.631 --> 01:52:07.334]  I mean, it shows how crazy the left has got.
[01:52:07.334 --> 01:52:12.640]  King is probably the biggest threat to their divisive message of anybody in our public lexicon.
[01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:15.944]  That's why I used to quote him once a month, every hour.
[01:52:15.944 --> 01:52:16.044]  Why?
[01:52:18.581 --> 01:52:20.342]  I mean, they have to take him out.
[01:52:20.342 --> 01:52:20.642]  Correct.
[01:52:20.642 --> 01:52:23.843]  And now they're floating made-up COINTELPRO.
[01:52:23.843 --> 01:52:27.945]  Now the left loves the FBI that was targeting black leaders.
[01:52:27.945 --> 01:52:29.206]  These are sick people!
[01:52:29.206 --> 01:52:44.333]  And people should ask, here you have these tapes that are not supposed to be publicly available in 2027 because of questions and doubts about their authenticity, questions and doubts about whether they were recorded accurately, whether... You can make a 20-second clip for 10 years and put it in Adobe and make people say whatever they want.
[01:52:44.333 --> 01:52:45.013]  Exactly.
[01:52:45.013 --> 01:52:47.374]  Then somehow it leaks out through the archives.
[01:52:47.774 --> 01:52:53.261]  Somebody at the Archives Division somehow puts up these particular tapes, only the ones that make him look bad.
[01:52:53.261 --> 01:52:59.007]  And I want to be clear, I'm not defending it, but if he was having sex with women, it doesn't matter.
[01:52:59.007 --> 01:53:03.913]  He said we're all equal under God and we should come together and not kill each other.
[01:53:03.913 --> 01:53:07.698]  But see, again, they're threatened by that, so they're shooping like Cavanaugh!
[01:53:08.158 --> 01:53:08.998]  Oh, that's fake!
[01:53:08.998 --> 01:53:10.199]  I don't believe any of it!
[01:53:10.199 --> 01:53:14.240]  I've had them edit tapes of me, folks, on Fox News with Megyn Kelly.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:22.584]  They didn't show the video, because you'd see the jump cuts, of me saying, Hillary killed kids in a basement, and all the stuff I didn't say, edited together, and they aired it!
[01:53:22.584 --> 01:53:23.084]  Absolutely.
[01:53:23.084 --> 01:53:25.485]  I mean, Media Matters has done that routinely and repeatedly.
[01:53:25.805 --> 01:53:30.968]  And the only way they get away with it is they link the actual video underneath that nobody ever actually watches, the original video.
[01:53:30.968 --> 01:53:31.868]  So this is what's happening.
[01:53:31.868 --> 01:53:43.133]  Here you have Martin Luther King, probably one of the great, without question, one of the greatest, maybe the greatest American, at least of the 20th century, who achieved extraordinary things in uniting Americans across the... Total icon!
[01:53:43.133 --> 01:53:43.674]  Absolutely.
[01:53:43.674 --> 01:53:46.595]  We have more streets named after him than any other person in the world.
[01:53:46.595 --> 01:53:48.096]  And the left is literally...
[01:53:49.895 --> 01:53:50.215]  Tearing
[01:54:09.396 --> 01:54:11.599]  Exactly, and they're doing the exact same thing here.
[01:54:11.599 --> 01:54:17.365]  The left is leaking a personal attack and highlighting and promoting the personal attack on King.
[01:54:17.365 --> 01:54:19.967]  I think they thought maybe the right would do so.
[01:54:19.967 --> 01:54:28.336]  Well, the right refused to engage in it because these days King is more of an icon to the right than he is to the left because he was a unifying figure and a deeply patriotic American.
[01:54:28.636 --> 01:54:32.977]  He was someone, he opposed war because he thought that war was not in America's best interest.
[01:54:32.977 --> 01:54:34.458]  Or American's best interest.
[01:54:34.458 --> 01:54:35.818]  And it turned out he was right.
[01:54:35.818 --> 01:54:37.379]  So that is his basis.
[01:54:37.379 --> 01:54:43.341]  So they're trying to leak negative, nasty things about King because they need to remove him from the lexicon.
[01:54:43.341 --> 01:54:45.541]  It's what communists do in hardcore leftists.
[01:54:45.541 --> 01:54:46.802]  They airbrush you out.
[01:54:46.802 --> 01:54:47.562]  Absolutely.
[01:54:47.562 --> 01:54:50.803]  They kill who you really are, shut you down, he's dead, that's perfect.
[01:54:50.803 --> 01:54:54.504]  Then they build up the straw man that you weren't, he's now a Kavanaugh rapist.
[01:54:54.784 --> 01:54:56.827]  Exactly.
[01:54:56.827 --> 01:54:58.850]  They're comparing him to Harvey Weinstein.
[01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:00.693]  That's how insane this is.
[01:55:00.693 --> 01:55:03.997]  They're saying that Martin Luther King was the Harvey Weinstein of history.
[01:55:03.997 --> 01:55:08.063]  That is a ridiculous and preposterous... Well that shows they've gone completely psychotic.
[01:55:11.192 --> 01:55:14.636]  What King said was true, whether what they're saying about him is true.
[01:55:14.636 --> 01:55:19.221]  I don't buy a damn, because I've been through so many lies, I don't believe a damn thing they say, plus they have no proof.
[01:55:19.221 --> 01:55:20.903]  It just makes me like King even more.
[01:55:20.903 --> 01:55:21.504]  Absolutely.
[01:55:21.504 --> 01:55:28.071]  And when I heard this, my first reaction was, anybody should be shocked at someone's privacy being invaded in this myth.
[01:55:28.211 --> 01:55:31.695]  Yeah, he's supposedly in hotel rooms and they're recording it under the bed?
[01:55:31.695 --> 01:55:37.321]  Exactly, and they're sharing it with a wide range of people and making jokes about it internally and their commentary about it.
[01:55:37.321 --> 01:55:40.024]  This is what should be shocking, is that this ever existed.
[01:55:40.024 --> 01:55:42.127]  And notice the feminists are attacking him now.
[01:55:42.127 --> 01:55:43.088]  Oh, these people.
[01:55:43.188 --> 01:55:49.290]  Any person taped in their most private, intimate thoughts anywhere in the world over their entire lifetimes... Out of context.
[01:55:49.290 --> 01:55:49.530]  Exactly.
[01:55:49.530 --> 01:55:54.032]  They're going to have things in there that they don't like, and they can be misconstrued and misinterpreted and misapplied.
[01:55:54.032 --> 01:55:59.274]  And the idea that, for example, if he did any of these bad things, why didn't any women ever complain ever during the time period?
[01:55:59.274 --> 01:55:59.874]  Never happened.
[01:55:59.874 --> 01:56:02.355]  But 50 years later... Right.
[01:56:02.355 --> 01:56:03.416]  You can be in the grave.
[01:56:03.416 --> 01:56:06.197]  I could be in the grave, and they just say, he's a rapist!
[01:56:06.197 --> 01:56:12.119]  In fact, it appears they've timed the leak of this through the National Archives to correspond to when everybody who could have been a witness is dead.
[01:56:12.879 --> 01:56:13.660]  I mean, that's what they did.
[01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:15.961]  They waited until everybody was dead who could refute this.
[01:56:15.961 --> 01:56:19.403]  Then they leak it knowing they can defame them and libel them forevermore.
[01:56:19.403 --> 01:56:22.545]  And because they need to, because they need the unifying pro-American message.
[01:56:22.545 --> 01:56:24.766]  I can't believe the Democrats are this dirty.
[01:56:24.766 --> 01:56:26.287]  This is the craziest thing I've ever seen.
[01:56:26.287 --> 01:56:28.968]  Well, they have gotten this sort of Stasi-level approach.
[01:56:28.968 --> 01:56:31.610]  This is, when they... Forge turrets just do it.
[01:56:31.610 --> 01:56:32.250]  Exactly.
[01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:35.572]  When they look at the Soviet model, they don't look at a model that is horrifying.
[01:56:35.592 --> 01:56:41.116]  By the way, Rolls-Summit, Kepler, and the Clintons, literally they're behind a production company now trying to take me down.
[01:56:41.116 --> 01:56:45.900]  They talk about it, how they want to take me down, and Bill's like hanging over and Hillary's hanging over him.
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.802]  I mean, it's like Twilight Zone.
[01:56:47.802 --> 01:56:48.742]  Oh, completely.
[01:56:48.742 --> 01:56:49.543]  It's their own world.
[01:56:49.543 --> 01:56:50.904]  I mean, she's like a Twilight figure.
[01:56:50.904 --> 01:56:52.746]  She's like a Stepford Wife candidate.
[01:56:52.746 --> 01:57:01.993]  But to do this to someone like King, who is really the most legitimate hero of America politically, someone the left has celebrated.
[01:57:01.993 --> 01:57:02.453]  Got killed.
[01:57:03.354 --> 01:57:04.095]  No, he died.
[01:57:04.095 --> 01:57:05.136]  He died for his cause.
[01:57:05.136 --> 01:57:08.538]  I mean, his last speech, he knew the death threats had been accelerating.
[01:57:08.538 --> 01:57:12.982]  He said, I'm not fearing any man, because I've been to the mountaintop and I've seen the promised land.
[01:57:12.982 --> 01:57:16.485]  And that promised land was the American Constitution being delivered to all Americans.
[01:57:16.485 --> 01:57:21.129]  And you can make up all this stuff, whether it's true or not, we know most of it's lies.
[01:57:21.129 --> 01:57:24.832]  You can hear in your soul, he believes it, he's real, and it's true.
[01:57:24.832 --> 01:57:25.292]  Absolutely.
[01:57:26.954 --> 01:57:29.496]  50-something years after he's dead, he's a rapist?
[01:57:29.496 --> 01:57:30.457]  With no proof?
[01:57:30.457 --> 01:57:32.739]  Or he supports rape?
[01:57:32.739 --> 01:57:33.519]  Bullcrap!
[01:57:33.519 --> 01:57:34.060]  Exactly.
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:34.981]  Bullcrap!
[01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:37.262]  But again, that's from the White Supremacist Info Wars, folks.
[01:57:37.262 --> 01:57:38.443]  You know how we are.
[01:57:38.443 --> 01:57:40.805]  You heard CNN, you heard Tom Brokaw.
[01:57:40.805 --> 01:57:43.808]  I'm a deeply alloyed racist.
[01:57:43.808 --> 01:57:44.648]  Yeah, right.
[01:57:44.648 --> 01:57:45.309]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:47.395 --> 01:57:50.420]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:53.005]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[01:57:53.005 --> 01:57:55.789]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[01:57:55.789 --> 01:57:57.773]  And the globalists are so upset.
[01:57:57.773 --> 01:58:00.597]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:02.340]  That's right.

[01:59:58.030 --> 01:59:59.131]  Big Brother.
[01:59:59.131 --> 02:00:00.954]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:00.954 --> 02:00:02.836]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:02.836 --> 02:00:04.519]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:00:04.519 --> 02:00:06.181]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:06.181 --> 02:00:10.887]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:55.262 --> 02:01:00.985]  During the break, Bob Barnes was watching a two-minute clip for TV viewers that shows Biden's latest groping.
[02:01:00.985 --> 02:01:04.807]  There's some new videos of him uncontrollably groping little girls, telling them they're pretty.
[02:01:04.807 --> 02:01:09.389]  You had an interesting term you used for it.
[02:01:09.389 --> 02:01:10.850]  We'll talk about next segment.
[02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:13.892]  We'll play that clip again for the full radio and TV audience.
[02:01:15.711 --> 02:01:20.474]  We're not just mechanically defending Martin Luther King.
[02:01:20.474 --> 02:01:23.597]  Martin Luther King has been dead, what, 50-something years?
[02:01:23.597 --> 02:01:25.478]  Oh yeah, 1968 was when he was killed.
[02:01:25.478 --> 02:01:26.258]  How long is that?
[02:01:26.258 --> 02:01:29.240]  That's 51 years now.
[02:01:29.240 --> 02:01:30.661]  It was 51 years last April.
[02:01:30.661 --> 02:01:43.711]  He's been dead 51 years, and then they just say all this has gone on with this whole, and now they're saying, like you said, he's the new Harvey Weinstein, with no proof.
[02:01:44.704 --> 02:01:55.354]  That's why we have statute of limitations, why we have all this, and you brought up group invites white women, because there's the other side of this, to voluntarily attend race-shaming dinners.
[02:01:55.354 --> 02:01:58.116]  This is newswars.com.
[02:01:58.116 --> 02:01:59.577]  Spread this article, folks.
[02:01:59.577 --> 02:02:04.322]  A group headed by a former congressional candidate is offering private dinners.
[02:02:04.322 --> 02:02:07.144]  And again, this article is important, but this is just part of the course.
[02:02:07.144 --> 02:02:08.505]  Exclusively to white women.
[02:02:09.397 --> 02:02:15.551]  Where they are lectured about how racist and supremacist they are, even if they don't realize it.
[02:02:15.551 --> 02:02:17.155]  So, this is just sensitivity training.
[02:02:18.359 --> 02:02:21.421]  Which is race-based brainwashing.
[02:02:21.421 --> 02:02:38.473]  And then it shows, we can show the article, it has graphics in it, crying black women saying, just because you're a woman doesn't mean you're as special as I. You then compete to be a greater victim and your whole world is about how you're this poor baby cake.
[02:02:38.473 --> 02:02:41.816]  And it's, and then meanwhile blacks are fighting from all over the world to get here.
[02:02:43.424 --> 02:02:46.825]  You've got New York Times, you know, board members saying whites are subhuman.
[02:02:46.825 --> 02:02:52.688]  They're really trying to convert minorities into foaming at the mouth racists who feel good about it.
[02:02:52.688 --> 02:02:58.250]  Not even racist from a superiority perspective, but racist because you've enslaved me perspective.
[02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:59.811]  And then you've got people adopting this.
[02:02:59.811 --> 02:03:03.553]  What do you think, in the two minutes we have to break, the endgame here is, Robert Barnes?
[02:03:03.553 --> 02:03:06.814]  Well, what you see is that they're looking historically, and you look at King.
[02:03:06.814 --> 02:03:09.055]  King was able to be a counterbalance to the Black Panthers.
[02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:17.660]  We're mostly basically just gang members disguised as a political organization who use the political excuse to commit crime with immunity and impunity.
[02:03:17.660 --> 02:03:19.941]  It's what radicalized David Horowitz.
[02:03:19.941 --> 02:03:24.424]  David Horowitz used to be a hardcore lefty, now he's one of the leaders of the intellectual political right.
[02:03:24.424 --> 02:03:28.746]  And the reason for that is because of the horrors he witnessed with what the Black Panthers did in San Francisco.
[02:03:28.746 --> 02:03:31.368]  Kidnapping, other forms of violent crime, extortion, etc.
[02:03:32.268 --> 02:03:37.030]  And so what you see with King is King presents a historical counter-narrative to the leftist agenda.
[02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:42.672]  It's a unifying agenda, it's an American-rooted agenda, it's a Constitution-based agenda.
[02:03:42.672 --> 02:03:58.918]  King was very much about unifying people, unifying people in the name of a conservative tradition in general, by appealing to our Constitutional history, and by particularly saying, and very patriotic, that because I'm an American, because I'm a man, I should have the same rights as all men and as all Americans.
[02:03:59.398 --> 02:04:02.581]  It was not a reparations-based appeal.
[02:04:02.581 --> 02:04:04.743]  It was not a victim-based appeal.
[02:04:04.743 --> 02:04:07.166]  It was not a poor-me-pity-me appeal.
[02:04:07.166 --> 02:04:09.848]  It was not a give-me-special-rights appeal.
[02:04:09.848 --> 02:04:15.894]  It was a give-me-equal-rights appeal because it rooted in Americanism and rooted in constitutionalism.
[02:04:16.394 --> 02:04:30.882]  You can't achieve these sort of shame dinners where you're combining, basically, specialty diversity training with a censorship, confessional, inquisitorial model of let's tell everybody about how horrible a person you are.
[02:04:30.882 --> 02:04:32.582]  This is 50 Shades of Grey.
[02:04:32.582 --> 02:04:34.123]  This is come get beat up.
[02:04:34.123 --> 02:04:34.403]  Exactly.
[02:04:34.403 --> 02:04:35.344]  You're 50 Shades of White.
[02:04:35.344 --> 02:04:36.765]  Confess how terrible you are.
[02:04:36.765 --> 02:04:43.068]  And in that world, Martin Luther King can't exist because Martin Luther King presents a counter narrative that says we're all great because we're Americans.
[02:04:43.388 --> 02:04:44.548]  What's that term you use?
[02:04:44.548 --> 02:04:46.989]  Any means?
[02:04:46.989 --> 02:04:52.110]  They will use any means possible for any purpose possible to achieve their destruction of their agenda.
[02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:56.291]  If that means the propagation of their agenda means destruction of individuals, they do it.
[02:04:56.291 --> 02:04:58.452]  Infowarshore.com is how you support us.
[02:04:58.452 --> 02:05:01.492]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.492 --> 02:05:10.074]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:10.074 --> 02:05:12.615]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:13.055 --> 02:05:14.776]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.776 --> 02:05:28.485]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[02:05:28.485 --> 02:05:31.427]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.427 --> 02:05:35.030]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:35.310 --> 02:05:39.334]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.334 --> 02:05:41.156]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:41.156 --> 02:05:47.263]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:47.263 --> 02:05:51.908]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[02:05:51.908 --> 02:05:53.009]  Have clean air.
[02:05:53.009 --> 02:05:54.270]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:07.322 --> 02:06:10.934]  Live, raw, and unfiltered.
[02:06:10.934 --> 02:06:12.600]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[02:06:26.607 --> 02:06:33.713]  Alright, I want to give the number out and I want to take your calls for constitutional lawyer, civil rights lawyer, Robert Bonds.
[02:06:33.713 --> 02:06:35.174]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:06:35.174 --> 02:06:46.364]  But specifically on what's happening with the attempt with all these fake investigations against Trump, what you think ought to happen listeners, Trump going on the offense, what's that going to look like?
[02:06:46.364 --> 02:06:48.686]  How will the deep state strike back?
[02:06:48.686 --> 02:06:50.247]  All the left is race baiting.
[02:06:50.247 --> 02:06:51.808]  Maybe Jared Kushner goes to Bilderberg?
[02:06:52.589 --> 02:06:53.769]  I think Judge Tree bites fruits.
[02:06:53.769 --> 02:06:56.550]  I mean, Trump goes to these other globalist confabs.
[02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:57.811]  We're taking these over.
[02:06:57.811 --> 02:07:00.211]  We were just exposing Bilderberg and it was going on.
[02:07:00.211 --> 02:07:01.692]  World government's out in the open now.
[02:07:01.692 --> 02:07:04.093]  But give me your take on all of that.
[02:07:04.093 --> 02:07:04.713]  877-789-ALEX.
[02:07:04.713 --> 02:07:04.753]  877-789-2539.
[02:07:12.025 --> 02:07:17.469]  Just address your question to Robert Barnes.
[02:07:17.469 --> 02:07:22.213]  877-789-2539 on this live Global Friday Edition.
[02:07:22.213 --> 02:07:25.475]  By the way, I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:07:25.475 --> 02:07:27.396]  Maybe you can host me?
[02:07:27.396 --> 02:07:27.837]  Sure.
[02:07:27.837 --> 02:07:28.917]  Everybody loves you, Bob.
[02:07:28.917 --> 02:07:29.418]  You're great.
[02:07:29.418 --> 02:07:34.241]  You'll be with us for two hours on Sunday as well at the Wharram, coming up 3 o'clock today.
[02:07:34.241 --> 02:07:38.745]  Nick Begich hosts the fourth hour as well, but I want to take your calls.
[02:07:38.745 --> 02:07:40.246]  There's so much news, though.
[02:07:41.664 --> 02:07:55.448]  We're just getting into Martin Luther King, we're getting into Joe Biden here, but like you were saying during the break, they've collectively only tuned into media like MSNBC and CNN that defends the system.
[02:07:55.448 --> 02:07:57.188]  And so they're in true echo chambers.
[02:07:57.188 --> 02:07:58.788]  I go and see what my enemies are saying.
[02:07:58.788 --> 02:08:02.389]  I go and see, I don't even really care what people that are supporting me say.
[02:08:02.389 --> 02:08:04.450]  They're great, I love you, you're like oxygen.
[02:08:05.896 --> 02:08:07.237]  But I don't want an echo chamber.
[02:08:07.237 --> 02:08:11.381]  I'm trying to see what they're saying about me so I know what's going on or what they're up to.
[02:08:11.381 --> 02:08:15.364]  But I look at these establishment people, they are in their own bubble.
[02:08:15.364 --> 02:08:18.567]  Pelosi's a stammering idiot for five years at least.
[02:08:18.567 --> 02:08:20.809]  AOC's a complete moron.
[02:08:20.809 --> 02:08:25.113]  Now they say in any videos criticizing Pelosi, you've got to be taken down.
[02:08:25.113 --> 02:08:29.497]  Biden can't keep his hands off other men's wives, children.
[02:08:31.032 --> 02:08:32.233]  Then he tries to spin it.
[02:08:32.233 --> 02:08:33.655]  Now there's a new video out.
[02:08:33.655 --> 02:08:36.697]  We'll play this compilation and then we'll play the new video.
[02:08:36.697 --> 02:08:38.439]  For radio listeners, we'll kind of go through it.
[02:08:38.439 --> 02:08:40.301]  But you've all seen the footage.
[02:08:40.301 --> 02:08:42.423]  But this is compulsive.
[02:08:42.423 --> 02:08:44.325]  This is neurotic.
[02:08:44.325 --> 02:08:47.908]  I dated a really nice lady that was a paralegal.
[02:08:47.908 --> 02:08:51.912]  She later became a lawyer when I was growing up in Dallas.
[02:08:51.912 --> 02:08:53.173]  And I knew her when I was in college.
[02:08:53.173 --> 02:08:54.154]  She was a few years older than me.
[02:08:55.245 --> 02:09:04.868]  And she would just tell me the joke about her boss, who had all these letters and was this big lawyer and made all this money, but occasionally he would eat boogers in front of you.
[02:09:04.868 --> 02:09:08.088]  He would just pull a booger out, he couldn't help it, he'd eat it.
[02:09:08.088 --> 02:09:10.929]  He'd kind of sneak it, but he ate it.
[02:09:10.929 --> 02:09:14.610]  And she would make jokes about it, and one time I watched dinner with him and he ate the booger in front of me.
[02:09:14.610 --> 02:09:16.751]  In front of his wife, he ate a booger.
[02:09:16.751 --> 02:09:18.951]  Now, I'm not being funny here.
[02:09:18.951 --> 02:09:23.133]  That's a little level of psychosis and insanity.
[02:09:23.133 --> 02:09:24.333]  Imagine you're Joe Biden,
[02:09:25.649 --> 02:09:30.071]  And people walk up, they're like, they're grabbing little kids, rubbing, smelling them, rubbing.
[02:09:30.071 --> 02:09:33.493]  If it was your uncle and you're doing it to the daughter, that's a little, you know, creepy.
[02:09:33.493 --> 02:09:34.934]  Yeah, there's footage of other people eating boogers.
[02:09:34.934 --> 02:09:36.555]  It's some kind of elitist thing.
[02:09:36.555 --> 02:09:37.756]  George W. does it too.
[02:09:37.756 --> 02:09:39.156]  I quit doing it when I was about three.
[02:09:39.156 --> 02:09:43.239]  I have a rare memory of being about three and like, I ate a booger that's got like sand in it.
[02:09:43.239 --> 02:09:44.299]  Like, God, that tastes bad.
[02:09:44.299 --> 02:09:45.100]  I'm gonna stop eating those.
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:47.883]  But seriously, I've eaten boogers.
[02:09:47.883 --> 02:09:48.644]  I just admitted it.
[02:09:48.644 --> 02:09:49.605]  It's a tell-all.
[02:09:49.605 --> 02:09:53.810]  Maybe I should go to this group that initiates white women to say they're racist and bad.
[02:09:53.810 --> 02:09:55.852]  I should go and admit I've eaten boogers at age 3.
[02:09:58.447 --> 02:10:01.449]  Bob, I'm taking you to the next level here.
[02:10:01.449 --> 02:10:05.691]  But seriously, Pelosi, Biden, we're going to play these clips.
[02:10:05.691 --> 02:10:06.952]  What do you make of this?
[02:10:06.952 --> 02:10:12.134]  So with Biden, it's a compulsive behavior, and it's quasi-pedophilia behavior.
[02:10:12.134 --> 02:10:17.037]  I mean, if you look at where he's moving his hands on little girls' bodies, I'm sorry, that's not normal.
[02:10:17.037 --> 02:10:20.659]  It's what you do to your wife if you think she's in the mood to get her in bed.
[02:10:21.239 --> 02:10:22.360]  Exactly.
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:23.781]  It's very sexualized.
[02:10:23.781 --> 02:10:24.982]  Very sexualized behavior.
[02:10:24.982 --> 02:10:27.823]  This is not normal behavior by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:10:27.823 --> 02:10:29.965]  People said, oh, it's just like your weird uncle.
[02:10:29.965 --> 02:10:33.527]  And I was like, well, if your creepy uncle has been convicted of pedophilia, maybe.
[02:10:33.527 --> 02:10:35.708]  I mean, that's the kind of behavior that it is.
[02:10:35.708 --> 02:10:44.554]  And the fact that he can't stop doing it, even though it's going to become high profile, and the fact that he does it repeatedly when he knows the cameras are on him, gives you a sense of how compulsive it is.
[02:10:45.034 --> 02:10:54.322]  I mean, it's like he cannot control himself, cannot stop himself, cannot prevent himself from doing the behavior that all of us should be deeply disturbed and unsettled by.
[02:10:54.322 --> 02:10:55.163]  This is not normal.
[02:10:55.163 --> 02:10:58.506]  This is another attempt to normalize bad behavior.
[02:10:58.506 --> 02:11:08.734]  The media's attempt to brush over this, the media's attempt to excuse it, the media's attempt to justify it is like Vox and Salon trying to say, well, pedophiles are normal and they just have maybe a little mental issue.
[02:11:08.734 --> 02:11:12.778]  No, they're perverts who present an imminent threat of danger to young children.
[02:11:13.118 --> 02:11:20.701]  And Biden's behavior is obsessive and it's compulsive in a way that is dangerous for a public politician who's been in the public eye to continue to do this.
[02:11:30.985 --> 02:11:31.486]  Oh, exactly.
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:50.640]  Yeah.
[02:12:04.497 --> 02:12:05.798]  This was his uncle's daughter or whatever.
[02:12:05.798 --> 02:12:07.320]  They said, oh, no, it's fine.
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:10.824]  Later, it turned out he had sex with her, all this stuff, about a month later.
[02:12:10.824 --> 02:12:12.746]  But it's just, it's crazy.
[02:12:12.746 --> 02:12:13.046]  Oh, exactly.
[02:12:13.046 --> 02:12:14.808]  I mean, when I've seen that behavior, I've cussed it out.
[02:12:14.808 --> 02:12:21.195]  When I've been at weddings or other events, we have somebody that's there that you don't want and that you, is not part of your family or anything else.
[02:12:21.195 --> 02:12:24.038]  This behavior is just completely unacceptable behavior, called out the behavior.
[02:12:24.398 --> 02:12:26.579]  So the idea is incredibly obvious.
[02:12:26.579 --> 02:12:26.999]  Exactly.
[02:12:26.999 --> 02:12:30.741]  I mean, this behavior is not, this is not trying to make a kid comfortable.
[02:12:30.741 --> 02:12:34.202]  This is not, it's not even Michael Jackson behavior, right?
[02:12:34.202 --> 02:12:39.025]  I mean, Michael Jackson was more, he wanted to be a 12-year-old kid hanging out with someone.
[02:12:39.025 --> 02:12:42.286]  This is, this is deliberately touchy-handy.
[02:12:42.286 --> 02:12:45.848]  And he does this control thing where he holds them and he rubs their cheeks.
[02:12:45.848 --> 02:12:47.348]  I mean, I've got three daughters.
[02:12:47.348 --> 02:12:48.809]  I've never sat there and I held them and like,
[02:12:49.309 --> 02:12:55.013]  I tried rubbing him and just like... Well it sort of reminds me of the Quentin Tarantino Pulp Fiction dialogue.
[02:12:55.013 --> 02:12:57.834]  That's completely sexual the way he just rubbed her cheeks.
[02:12:57.834 --> 02:12:58.475]  Completely.
[02:12:58.475 --> 02:13:06.220]  Like they're describing in the Quentin Tarantino's movie Pulp Fiction about why you wouldn't necessarily give a foot massage to somebody else's wife because of certain things.
[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:07.400]  The things he's doing is even more intimate.
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:07.560]  Exactly.
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:09.682]  There's certain things that are just as intimate as...
[02:13:11.001 --> 02:13:12.622]  Just look at them going down on your wife.
[02:13:12.622 --> 02:13:17.485]  I mean, seriously, when I mean like your wife better be in the right mood when you do that under the cheek thing.
[02:13:17.485 --> 02:13:19.766]  I mean, this is like seriously correct.
[02:13:19.766 --> 02:13:22.648]  This is like very invasive.
[02:13:22.648 --> 02:13:23.688]  It can be invasive.
[02:13:23.688 --> 02:13:28.731]  It's because it's so intimate that if it's if it's not welcome or not wanted, you better know.
[02:13:28.731 --> 02:13:29.512]  And all of these things.
[02:13:29.512 --> 02:13:30.472]  So let's be clear.
[02:13:30.472 --> 02:13:32.013]  Your wife, you've had sex with 500 times.
[02:13:33.610 --> 02:13:34.671]  Thousand times.
[02:13:34.671 --> 02:13:38.254]  If you don't do it just right at the right time, the way he's doing this, they would reject it.
[02:13:38.254 --> 02:13:39.635]  This is very sexual.
[02:13:39.635 --> 02:13:40.075]  Exactly.
[02:13:40.075 --> 02:13:41.697]  Because otherwise it's invasive.
[02:13:41.697 --> 02:13:43.638]  Because that's the nature of true intimacy.
[02:13:43.638 --> 02:13:46.641]  It's invasive if it's not approved, if it's not consensual.
[02:13:46.641 --> 02:13:51.365]  And the way to look at it is, if you look at this behavior, is this something you would do with your wife or your girlfriend?
[02:13:51.365 --> 02:13:52.806]  And the kids are always trying to get away.
[02:13:53.306 --> 02:13:58.071]  It's just like Drag Queen Story Time, where they're convicted pedophiles, and they don't even tell the parents.
[02:13:58.071 --> 02:14:02.155]  They bring the kids in and set them on these guys laps, and the kids are fighting to get away.
[02:14:02.155 --> 02:14:04.116]  Look at that, grabbing them by the arm.
[02:14:04.116 --> 02:14:06.419]  Not only that, it's almost disproportionately girls.
[02:14:06.419 --> 02:14:09.341]  Like the original excuse was... Oh, is there any video boys?
[02:14:09.341 --> 02:14:10.142]  Almost none.
[02:14:10.142 --> 02:14:12.825]  And that gives you a sign like, I mean like, here... Oh, look at that.
[02:14:13.385 --> 02:14:15.405]  Notice he doesn't do that to the boy.
[02:14:15.405 --> 02:14:16.666]  So he knows of this difference.
[02:14:16.666 --> 02:14:18.246]  He knows of this distinction.
[02:14:18.246 --> 02:14:23.847]  So this is not just the hair sniffing routine with everybody's wife.
[02:14:23.847 --> 02:14:27.728]  You know, to be honest with you, that I would find, you know, irritating.
[02:14:27.728 --> 02:14:36.890]  But I wouldn't find... If I was good buddies with somebody and they kissed my wife on the cheek or patted her on the ass, I'd still be like, OK, he's just familiar.
[02:14:36.890 --> 02:14:39.530]  But somebody you don't know, be like, hey, dude, what are you doing?
[02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:43.011]  But if they did that to my daughter when she was that age, it would be a different reaction.
[02:14:43.151 --> 02:14:46.034]  Well sure, but he does that to like full-grown women.
[02:14:46.034 --> 02:14:48.677]  He'll grab them and set them on his lap and dudes get pissed.
[02:14:48.677 --> 02:14:49.939]  Yeah, there he is rubbing a breast.
[02:14:49.939 --> 02:14:52.842]  Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry, there's nothing about that that's normal.
[02:14:52.842 --> 02:14:54.304]  He never does that to any boy.
[02:14:54.304 --> 02:14:56.306]  So this isn't some like weird thing he grew up with.
[02:14:56.306 --> 02:14:57.868]  So this is an out-of-control pervert.
[02:14:57.868 --> 02:14:58.128]  Correct.
[02:14:58.288 --> 02:15:01.389]  That's so compulsive in his behavior that even when he knows he's being filmed.
[02:15:01.389 --> 02:15:04.190]  And what is the putting the head to him and like the smelling him?
[02:15:04.190 --> 02:15:05.470]  That for him is his man.
[02:15:05.470 --> 02:15:08.651]  He loves hair and he's very intimate about the way he does it.
[02:15:08.651 --> 02:15:09.931]  And that's why he's soft.
[02:15:09.931 --> 02:15:10.951]  I mean, notice the soft touch.
[02:15:10.951 --> 02:15:12.772]  I mean, these are not the kind of touches.
[02:15:12.772 --> 02:15:15.653]  And the other thing is he gets real excited while he's doing it.
[02:15:15.653 --> 02:15:19.314]  You don't see like in contrast it to the coverage of Trump with his daughter.
[02:15:19.314 --> 02:15:23.775]  Like if Trump just pats his daughter on the back, they say, oh, that's somehow weird or perverted.
[02:15:23.775 --> 02:15:25.255]  This is what's weird and perverted.
[02:15:25.255 --> 02:15:26.476]  I was about 14 years old.
[02:15:28.582 --> 02:15:32.064]  And one of my dad's cousins was over and she was a good-looking hot blonde.
[02:15:32.064 --> 02:15:34.186]  She was probably like 30 years old.
[02:15:34.186 --> 02:15:35.086]  And man, her husband was there.
[02:15:35.086 --> 02:15:36.347]  And I tell you, we've been out shooting and everything.
[02:15:36.347 --> 02:15:37.167]  He's a lawyer.
[02:15:37.167 --> 02:15:37.928]  I've been out there with her.
[02:15:37.928 --> 02:15:38.468]  We're friends.
[02:15:38.468 --> 02:15:42.010]  But man, I slapped her on the ass and it was sexual.
[02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:43.832]  And he kind of looked at me and said, hey, you better watch it.
[02:15:43.832 --> 02:15:44.592]  And she laughed.
[02:15:44.592 --> 02:15:48.114]  But he was like, and I'm a 14-year-old slapping a full-grown woman on the ass.
[02:15:48.114 --> 02:15:50.396]  And he was kind of like, hey, junior, you better watch it.
[02:15:50.396 --> 02:15:52.617]  Because it was sexual and I couldn't help it.
[02:15:52.617 --> 02:15:53.297]  It's unbelievable.
[02:15:53.297 --> 02:15:53.858]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:55.754 --> 02:16:00.837]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[02:16:26.473 --> 02:16:30.394]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:30.394 --> 02:16:31.914]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:31.914 --> 02:16:34.875]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:34.875 --> 02:16:40.436]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[02:16:54.779 --> 02:17:01.144]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:01.144 --> 02:17:04.186]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.186 --> 02:17:10.110]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.110 --> 02:17:13.893]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.893 --> 02:17:14.834]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:15.154 --> 02:17:16.155]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:16.155 --> 02:17:22.701]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.

[02:18:00.956 --> 02:18:02.316]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:18:02.316 --> 02:18:03.837]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:18:03.837 --> 02:18:04.638]  I'm so excited.
[02:18:04.638 --> 02:18:05.538]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:18:05.538 --> 02:18:08.019]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:18:08.019 --> 02:18:10.521]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:18:10.521 --> 02:18:11.941]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:11.941 --> 02:18:13.382]  The Bone Broth.
[02:18:13.382 --> 02:18:14.763]  The B-B-Bone Broth.
[02:18:14.763 --> 02:18:16.044]  The B-B-Bone Broth.
[02:18:16.044 --> 02:18:19.285]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake.
[02:18:19.285 --> 02:18:20.786]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:18:20.786 --> 02:18:21.947]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:21.947 --> 02:18:23.388]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:23.388 --> 02:18:25.189]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:18:25.189 --> 02:18:25.929]  Like good!
[02:18:26.249 --> 02:18:26.869]  Whoa!
[02:18:26.869 --> 02:18:28.570]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:28.570 --> 02:18:32.771]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:38.593]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for that as well.
[02:18:38.593 --> 02:18:40.773]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products.
[02:18:40.773 --> 02:18:48.356]  Excuse me, I'm thanking you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:18:48.356 --> 02:18:49.096]  It is next level.
[02:18:49.096 --> 02:18:50.296]  It really is good, so thank you.
[02:18:50.296 --> 02:18:52.237]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:52.237 --> 02:18:52.597]  Thank you.

[02:19:11.696 --> 02:19:13.176]  You're our only sponsors.
[02:19:13.176 --> 02:19:19.659]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.

[02:19:22.140 --> 02:19:23.961]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.

[02:19:51.890 --> 02:19:52.530]  God bless you.
[02:19:59.339 --> 02:20:01.949]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:30.146 --> 02:20:32.508]  You found it.
[02:20:32.508 --> 02:20:37.611]  The program, the Clintons, the Chadcombs want shut down.
[02:20:37.611 --> 02:20:38.632]  Thanks to you standing with us.
[02:20:38.632 --> 02:20:39.212]  We're still here.
[02:20:39.212 --> 02:20:39.552]  Thank you.
[02:20:39.552 --> 02:20:41.113]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:41.113 --> 02:20:43.595]  Your phone calls are coming up next segment.
[02:20:43.595 --> 02:20:51.140]  During the break, I was back in the coffee room where somebody bought donuts and I just inhaled two of them.
[02:20:51.140 --> 02:20:52.761]  Stop it!
[02:20:52.761 --> 02:20:55.943]  Even though I appreciate it.
[02:20:55.943 --> 02:20:59.386]  I was back to get a cup of coffee and ate two donuts and I was watching Fox News.
[02:21:00.609 --> 02:21:01.231]  We're good.
[02:21:09.386 --> 02:21:17.791]  The Attorney General, and he's like, trying to overthrow a president, lying about it, setting him up, trying to say that you're going to overthrow an election.
[02:21:17.791 --> 02:21:19.372]  That's the tyranny here.
[02:21:19.372 --> 02:21:21.073]  We shouldn't be talking about impeaching Trump.
[02:21:21.073 --> 02:21:22.493]  There's no evidence.
[02:21:22.493 --> 02:21:24.254]  He said this whole system is in danger.
[02:21:24.254 --> 02:21:25.495]  It's out of control.
[02:21:25.495 --> 02:21:26.536]  Our DVR crashed.
[02:21:26.536 --> 02:21:28.857]  Maybe we'll have it later, but I'm sure the clip's everywhere.
[02:21:28.857 --> 02:21:31.198]  I would just pull up Bob Barr on CBS.
[02:21:31.198 --> 02:21:31.859]  It's all over the place.
[02:21:33.803 --> 02:21:36.005]  Talk about Bob Barr a little bit.
[02:21:36.005 --> 02:21:43.930]  I know you've studied him and others, and I've talked to people I know that are patriots in the Pentagon and in a three-letter agency who are actually good people who have a history of being whistleblowers.
[02:21:43.930 --> 02:21:47.112]  Some on air from the CIA, some that haven't been on air.
[02:21:47.112 --> 02:21:52.896]  They said, no, Barr's actually been good for a long time at trying to stabilize things and actually going after corruption.
[02:21:52.896 --> 02:21:54.978]  Now, maybe that's not entirely true.
[02:21:54.978 --> 02:21:56.419]  I think the jury's still out.
[02:21:57.304 --> 02:22:05.866]  But regardless, what the left's done is so dangerous, even to the power structure, that at some level it's got to be dialed back, just from their perspective.
[02:22:05.866 --> 02:22:07.267]  But here's the Hill article.
[02:22:07.267 --> 02:22:15.349]  Professor who correctly predicted nine presidential elections says Trump will win in 2020 unless Democrats impeach.
[02:22:16.351 --> 02:22:27.599]  An American University professor who correctly predicted the last nine presidential elections says President Trump will win the 2020 election unless Congressional Democrats grow a spine, which he's pushing him to do.
[02:22:27.599 --> 02:22:35.205]  Alan Lichtman, a political historian, said Democrats only have a shot at the White House if they begin impeachment proceedings against Trump.
[02:22:36.052 --> 02:22:36.832]  You think that's true?
[02:22:36.832 --> 02:22:39.533]  And where do you think this goes?
[02:22:39.533 --> 02:22:40.534]  I think Lippman's wrong.
[02:22:40.534 --> 02:22:42.434]  I mean, I think Lippman wants it to be that way.
[02:22:42.434 --> 02:22:45.475]  What it is, Lippman has a subjective component and an objective component.
[02:22:45.475 --> 02:22:52.078]  Because I've studied all of these because I've been the, you know, one of the prime successes at betting presidential politics now going on 20 years.
[02:22:52.078 --> 02:22:54.758]  Well, they say you're the guy that does the biggest bets on presidential elections.
[02:22:54.758 --> 02:22:55.079]  Correct.
[02:22:55.079 --> 02:22:57.899]  I'm the most successful American political bettor according to the UK Times.
[02:22:57.899 --> 02:22:58.680]  So our headline should be...
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:01.722]  Top political better calls 2020.
[02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:33.421]  And his gravitas up against 20-something Crypt Keepers?
[02:23:33.421 --> 02:23:33.842]  Exactly.
[02:23:33.842 --> 02:23:38.063]  Not only that, the second measurement is if the Republican Party was meaningfully split.
[02:23:38.063 --> 02:23:41.564]  So if his base had turned on him, then he would be in trouble.
[02:23:41.564 --> 02:23:43.245]  His base is completely aligned with him.
[02:23:43.245 --> 02:23:46.866]  He continues to advocate for the positions that got him elected.
[02:23:46.866 --> 02:23:51.208]  Did so yesterday by imposing tariffs on Mexico as long as immigration remains a problem.
[02:23:51.208 --> 02:23:56.290]  And Mexico within 24 hours was calling for a conference to discuss how they could meet the President's objectives.
[02:23:56.630 --> 02:24:00.391]  So you have North Korea wanting to reignite peace talks.
[02:24:00.391 --> 02:24:06.233]  So you have China at the table to discuss meaningful trade reform that will protect American jobs.
[02:24:06.233 --> 02:24:09.675]  So he's done things that other presidents have promised but failed to deliver on.
[02:24:09.675 --> 02:24:12.035]  And so people just don't have a sense.
[02:24:12.035 --> 02:24:14.816]  They know the power structure is pissed.
[02:24:14.816 --> 02:24:16.577]  A lot of things have gotten better.
[02:24:16.577 --> 02:24:19.618]  Trump clearly is trying and that's really all people are looking for.
[02:24:19.838 --> 02:24:20.398]  Absolutely.
[02:24:20.398 --> 02:24:29.223]  And so, historically, when the incumbent presidential party is not meaningfully divided, the incumbent has won every single election in American political history.
[02:24:29.223 --> 02:24:47.974]  The third thing that happens, so you have the economy good, you have the country safe, you have the party base happy, excited, want Trump to keep going, and the third part is the party in opposition tends to look at their field and say, not look for who would make the best president, they look at their field and say, who's the most politician of the bunch?
[02:24:48.434 --> 02:24:50.095]  So that's how you get Bob Dole in 1996.
[02:24:50.095 --> 02:24:53.978]  That's how you get John Kerry in 2004.
[02:24:53.978 --> 02:24:56.700]  That's how you get Mitt Romney in 2012.
[02:24:56.700 --> 02:25:01.424]  Nobody ever looked at any of those guys and said, oh, that person's so naturally a president.
[02:25:01.424 --> 02:25:04.886]  Instead, they looked at him and said, that guy reminds me of a politician.
[02:25:04.886 --> 02:25:05.347]  Exactly.
[02:25:05.347 --> 02:25:06.388]  You look at Trump, you go...
[02:25:07.108 --> 02:25:07.808]  Leadership.
[02:25:07.808 --> 02:25:08.169]  Exactly.
[02:25:08.169 --> 02:25:09.749]  You go, that's president.
[02:25:09.749 --> 02:25:11.290]  And the whole world sees it.
[02:25:11.290 --> 02:25:12.210]  That's John Wayne.
[02:25:12.210 --> 02:25:13.931]  I mean, it's like big.
[02:25:13.931 --> 02:25:14.992]  And he's delivering.
[02:25:14.992 --> 02:25:15.292]  Exactly.
[02:25:15.292 --> 02:25:19.534]  What happens is the party in opposition feels so much fear over the incumbent.
[02:25:19.534 --> 02:25:21.374]  They think the incumbent is definitely going to win.
[02:25:21.374 --> 02:25:22.735]  And sometimes it's a conscious fear.
[02:25:22.735 --> 02:25:24.356]  Sometimes it's an unconscious fear.
[02:25:24.356 --> 02:25:25.896]  In Lippman's case, it's a conscious fear.
[02:25:25.896 --> 02:25:33.140]  That's why he's advocating for things to make up standards that don't exist to propagate a different theory of the election when his own data says that.
[02:25:33.140 --> 02:25:33.800]  I totally agree.
[02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:34.881]  And everybody knows truth from the hearing.
[02:25:36.081 --> 02:25:37.062]  How do they counter-strike?
[02:25:37.062 --> 02:25:38.984]  Because they are counter-striking.
[02:25:38.984 --> 02:25:43.187]  All the fake investigations, Antifa, activated terrorists, assassination.
[02:25:43.187 --> 02:25:48.272]  If they were smart, they would put a message out there that would persuade the public audience.
[02:25:48.272 --> 02:25:51.254]  They would put a message out there that would re-up Trump and beat Trump.
[02:25:51.254 --> 02:25:53.276]  A positive, instead it's only negative.
[02:25:53.476 --> 02:25:53.796]  Correct.
[02:25:53.796 --> 02:25:57.180]  America sucks, we're all racist, it's over.
[02:25:57.180 --> 02:25:58.681]  Contrast it to what happened in Sweden.
[02:25:58.681 --> 02:26:03.946]  So Sweden, the party on the left, decided to embrace the most restrictive immigration reforms in history.
[02:26:03.946 --> 02:26:08.090]  And they were able to regain power because they changed their policies on immigration.
[02:26:08.090 --> 02:26:09.792]  They did what the people wanted.
[02:26:09.792 --> 02:26:10.192]  Exactly.
[02:26:10.192 --> 02:26:12.575]  Bernie Sanders just went back to his 2015 position on immigration.
[02:26:14.036 --> 02:26:29.630]  Instead it was a Koch Brothers conspiracy to drive down wages in America that he would actually have a viable chance against the president in a re-election bid because then his immigration position would be no different than Trump's and be equally aggressive and then he could pitch his different ideas to make the world a safer a better place.
[02:26:29.630 --> 02:26:35.254]  But instead, as long as they're focused on Trump, and this Trump understands, if they're talking about him, he's winning.
[02:26:35.254 --> 02:26:39.978]  And so if they're talking about impeachment, if they're talking about efforts to take him out... He gets it though.
[02:26:39.978 --> 02:26:41.700]  He's taking the oxygen out of their paradigm.
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:42.320]  Correct.
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:45.403]  The real threat Trump faces right now is not so much from the Democratic Party.
[02:26:45.403 --> 02:26:47.924]  There are dead men walking.
[02:26:47.924 --> 02:26:48.945]  It's the deep state.
[02:26:48.945 --> 02:26:59.473]  The deep state will not accept being targeted for all of their bad conduct and malfeasance and misfeasance in the 2016 election, for their misdeeds during the Mueller inquiry investigation.
[02:26:59.853 --> 02:27:10.315]  Mueller was his shot across the bow, not to help Democrats, but to help the deep state use the Democrats in the House in order to counteract Trump's Spygate inquiry.
[02:27:10.315 --> 02:27:11.856]  That's what all of that is about.
[02:27:11.856 --> 02:27:25.639]  So his biggest adversary right now is, it's not Kim in North Korea, it's not China trying to do what they're doing, it's not the Democratic Party domestically who are dead men walking, it is in whatever they say about Nancy Pelosi, I mean she looks like a dead person talking.
[02:27:25.999 --> 02:27:27.200]  So it's none of them.
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:28.060]  It's the deep state.
[02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:29.141]  And that means he needs to go at that.
[02:27:29.141 --> 02:27:30.201]  That's who is his enemy.
[02:27:30.201 --> 02:27:31.262]  Those are the people sabotaging.
[02:27:31.262 --> 02:27:32.883]  The people not getting the agenda through.
[02:27:32.883 --> 02:27:33.323]  Exactly.
[02:27:33.323 --> 02:27:34.564]  Taking papers off his desk.
[02:27:34.564 --> 02:27:39.967]  He ordered, just totally constitutional, that Brennan lose his security clearance.
[02:27:39.967 --> 02:27:41.347]  Didn't lose it two months ago.
[02:27:41.347 --> 02:27:42.048]  Exactly.
[02:27:42.048 --> 02:27:46.630]  So it's the politicized parts of the spy network that are using that power.
[02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:52.293]  I mean, that led Snowden to become a whistleblower because he saw where it was going, even with a president he liked in Obama.
[02:27:52.293 --> 02:27:54.755]  He realized how dangerous this was going to be politicized.
[02:27:54.755 --> 02:27:55.175]  I totally agree.
[02:27:57.077 --> 02:28:00.162]  Let's get into worst case scenario when we come back.
[02:28:00.162 --> 02:28:04.288]  Because we've had, what, four American presidents assassinated, or is it five?
[02:28:04.288 --> 02:28:05.489]  I'd have to go back and look.
[02:28:05.489 --> 02:28:07.693]  You've had some shot at and some successfully killed.
[02:28:07.693 --> 02:28:09.375]  So the numbers vary based on that.
[02:28:11.914 --> 02:28:14.396]  Exactly, like Teddy Roosevelt got shot in the chest, he'll give a speech.
[02:28:14.396 --> 02:28:15.257]  Correct.
[02:28:15.257 --> 02:28:17.179]  Reagan got shot, survived.
[02:28:17.179 --> 02:28:19.221]  They tried to kill Roosevelt, but he survived.
[02:28:19.221 --> 02:28:22.544]  I think it's four dead, three shot.
[02:28:22.544 --> 02:28:27.029]  Well, if you count the other, Jackson, he got shot and stabbed, he wasn't president.
[02:28:27.029 --> 02:28:28.650]  Correct, that's true.
[02:28:28.650 --> 02:28:31.233]  Anyways, they're gonna try to kill the president.
[02:28:31.233 --> 02:28:34.116]  These globalists don't give up, and so I think everybody needs to know
[02:28:35.779 --> 02:28:37.581]  They can do a truck bomb, say jihadis did it.
[02:28:37.581 --> 02:28:41.825]  They've been doing too much positive publicity of people who've done violence on the White House lawn or near it.
[02:28:41.825 --> 02:28:43.147]  That's right, they're signaling.
[02:28:43.147 --> 02:28:44.488]  They're greenlighting.
[02:28:44.488 --> 02:28:46.470]  Exactly, they're triggering it, they're greenlighting it.
[02:28:46.470 --> 02:28:48.452]  Let's talk about worst case scenarios.
[02:28:48.452 --> 02:28:50.354]  And the left's only thinking one-dimensional.
[02:28:50.354 --> 02:28:53.537]  If you kill him, do you guys have any idea what happens to you?
[02:28:53.537 --> 02:28:53.978]  My God.
[02:28:55.313 --> 02:28:57.193]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:28:57.193 --> 02:29:00.434]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.

[02:29:02.015 --> 02:29:04.855]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[02:29:04.855 --> 02:29:05.515]  Awesome.
[02:29:05.515 --> 02:29:08.596]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.

[02:29:10.797 --> 02:29:14.958]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready-to-eat right from the pack bacon.
[02:29:14.958 --> 02:29:16.378]  Or warm and served.
[02:29:16.378 --> 02:29:18.438]  Life-saving, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:29:18.438 --> 02:29:20.379]  10-year shelf life bacon.

[02:31:55.561 --> 02:31:59.746]  The Globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:31:59.746 --> 02:32:00.807]  They are technocrats.
[02:32:00.807 --> 02:32:03.090]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:32:03.090 --> 02:32:09.978]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:32:10.458 --> 02:32:12.320]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:32:12.320 --> 02:32:14.782]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:32:14.782 --> 02:32:21.287]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:32:21.287 --> 02:32:26.472]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warsandlife.com, I couldn't do it.

[02:32:53.406 --> 02:32:55.086]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:16.786 --> 02:33:19.487]  He aligns himself with the truth.
[02:33:19.487 --> 02:33:22.428]  And it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:22.428 --> 02:33:25.089]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.089 --> 02:33:32.071]  Chaos is hanging around.
[02:33:32.071 --> 02:33:35.092]  Put your ear to the ground.
[02:33:35.092 --> 02:33:37.993]  And shut up from the sound.
[02:33:37.993 --> 02:33:41.435]  The death machine is slowing down.
[02:33:41.435 --> 02:33:42.855]  It's gaining power.
[02:33:45.191 --> 02:33:48.173]  Why are we seeing all this happen?
[02:33:48.173 --> 02:34:03.601]  And I gotta tell you, there's a lot of powerful corrupt people in this world, but Hillary Clinton was able to sycophantically get all these college heads, all these corporate heads to worship her.
[02:34:03.601 --> 02:34:11.805]  And still, when she goes out on the road, and she goes to universities, the people act like
[02:34:13.191 --> 02:34:17.213]  Jesus Christ just landed in a flying saucer.
[02:34:17.213 --> 02:34:22.796]  This is an incredibly boring, stupid, evil woman, in my view.
[02:34:22.796 --> 02:34:26.378]  She has a criminal intelligence, but that's about it.
[02:34:26.378 --> 02:34:30.720]  Bob Barnes, smart constitutional lawyer, civil rights lawyer.
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:33.282]  What do you think the mystery of Hillary Clinton is?
[02:34:33.282 --> 02:34:36.744]  Just briefly, I want to go to calls, and what happens
[02:34:38.220 --> 02:34:52.233]  If they do successfully assassinate Trump, and what are other wild cards, as you've said a year ago, and now it's being borne out by political analysts and others, Trump's 95% chance is going to win.
[02:34:52.233 --> 02:34:57.358]  So the Democrats' only desperate measure is to try to impeach, even though that makes him more likely to win.
[02:34:57.358 --> 02:35:03.483]  And instead of giving up, they just lie even more, bully even more.
[02:35:04.403 --> 02:35:10.586]  And that doesn't make people give in to them, it only makes people get more staunchly hardline.
[02:35:10.586 --> 02:35:10.966]  Exactly.
[02:35:10.966 --> 02:35:24.793]  If they were smart, they would figure out, they would just concede he's going to win re-election, sort of like Tip O'Neill did in 1983 with Reagan, and look at areas where they could work together to achieve mutual objectives that would allow the Democrats to maintain some degree of power base either in the House or the Senate.
[02:35:24.793 --> 02:35:25.934]  That would be the smart move.
[02:35:26.614 --> 02:35:28.335]  Uh, they're not making the smart move.
[02:35:28.335 --> 02:35:32.917]  Because, first of all, they're a party that's completely discordant, can't agree amongst each other.
[02:35:32.917 --> 02:35:39.921]  You have a radical young left that wants to take a sort of cultural Mao revolution to its older generation and just wipe them out, literally and figuratively.
[02:35:39.921 --> 02:35:44.984]  You see that when you see the millennial left and the new left going after people like Martin Luther King.
[02:35:44.984 --> 02:35:48.946]  When they're doing that, then you have a sense that they have no sense of boundaries, no sense of limits.
[02:35:48.946 --> 02:35:49.726]  No bottom!
[02:35:49.726 --> 02:35:50.166]  Exactly.
[02:35:50.166 --> 02:35:51.047]  No restriction.
[02:35:51.047 --> 02:35:52.848]  There is no bottom to their gutter.
[02:35:53.188 --> 02:35:57.650]  Their ethical gutter keeps going and keeps going and keeps going past the levels of hell.
[02:35:57.650 --> 02:36:04.533]  And so when they're willing to do that, when they're ready to do that, then that means that they have no sense of boundaries, no sense of constraint.
[02:36:04.533 --> 02:36:05.973]  They're not self-aware.
[02:36:05.973 --> 02:36:06.333]  Absolutely.
[02:36:06.333 --> 02:36:08.414]  Pushing impeachment is counterproductive.
[02:36:08.414 --> 02:36:10.595]  All it will do is it will keep the focus on Trump.
[02:36:10.595 --> 02:36:12.476]  So that's what Trump wants, number one.
[02:36:12.476 --> 02:36:14.296]  Number two, in fact, they've done the surveys on this.
[02:36:14.296 --> 02:36:22.720]  The reason why Pelosi didn't talk about impeachment for the last six months of 2018 is because their survey showed that whenever the word impeachment was mentioned, Trump's support went up.
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:26.121]  And not only that, Republican support goes up in the House.
[02:36:26.121 --> 02:36:29.682]  And voting Republican in the House, voting Republican in the Senate.
[02:36:29.682 --> 02:36:39.086]  And the reason for that is they're going to see the House and the Senate as completely useless in Democratic hands, because all they did is try to distract and detract from the President's agenda, which is very popular throughout the country.
[02:36:39.386 --> 02:36:45.090]  That's why Trump uniquely has higher job approval ratings on substantive issues than he does in general.
[02:36:45.090 --> 02:36:47.932]  And that reflects that people like his policies.
[02:36:47.932 --> 02:36:53.196]  Usually when you have someone like Obama, a lot of people wanted to like Obama so they would give him high job approval.
[02:36:53.196 --> 02:36:56.178]  But when you ask them about his policies, it would tank.
[02:36:56.178 --> 02:36:57.439]  With Trump, it's just the opposite.
[02:36:57.439 --> 02:37:01.242]  Because his personality is controversial, it's his policies that they're so happy about.
[02:37:01.502 --> 02:37:05.806]  Where he's getting huge approval on the economy, on national security, on immigration.
[02:37:05.806 --> 02:37:07.467]  These areas are going off the charts.
[02:37:07.467 --> 02:37:10.610]  So they cannot compete with him on the policy agenda.
[02:37:10.610 --> 02:37:14.393]  So if they were smart, they would try to co-opt some portion of that policy agenda.
[02:37:14.393 --> 02:37:23.640]  They would say, hey, we can be useful, we can work together with the president to have an industrial plan that rebuilds America, that has an infrastructure budget that helps rebuild America.
[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:25.682]  Areas where they have common cause with the president.
[02:37:26.182 --> 02:37:32.089]  Come to terms on the immigration issues rather than continuing to use the judges to wage a lawfare against the president.
[02:37:32.089 --> 02:37:38.616]  And the president has been subject to more injunctions against his executive policies than all the presidents in the 20th century combined.
[02:37:38.616 --> 02:37:42.120]  And I love how some people still on the internet because the left's funding from below and above.
[02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:43.961]  Oh, he's establishment.
[02:37:43.961 --> 02:37:45.102]  Oh, he's a new world order.
[02:37:45.102 --> 02:37:47.544]  Yeah, that's why they're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:37:47.544 --> 02:37:53.768]  No, Trump's not perfect, but he's really trying to be the president and not doing what they say.
[02:37:53.768 --> 02:37:56.410]  Doesn't mean everything he does is perfect.
[02:37:56.410 --> 02:38:00.233]  We're only human, but he's not taking orders and that's the issue.
[02:38:00.433 --> 02:38:01.834]  No, no doubt about it whatsoever.
[02:38:01.834 --> 02:38:05.136]  You wouldn't have had the deep state wage a two-year war against him if he hadn't been there.
[02:38:05.136 --> 02:38:05.916]  Think about that.
[02:38:05.916 --> 02:38:09.278]  I mean, we have a president actually calling the shots.
[02:38:09.278 --> 02:38:10.959]  That didn't happen halfway since Reagan.
[02:38:10.959 --> 02:38:11.459]  No, no doubt.
[02:38:11.459 --> 02:38:19.484]  And when's the last time you had a president live on national television talk about the military security complex trying to be a war-raging machine that he's fighting against?
[02:38:19.824 --> 02:38:22.266]  I mean, Eisenhower waited until he was about to leave office to advertise.
[02:38:22.266 --> 02:38:23.287]  He's telling everybody.
[02:38:23.287 --> 02:38:23.587]  Exactly.
[02:38:23.587 --> 02:38:25.769]  He's not against the military, he's against interests.
[02:38:25.769 --> 02:38:26.129]  Exactly.
[02:38:26.129 --> 02:38:34.896]  He's saying that the soldiers he completely supports, and it's because he supports those soldiers that he's not going to put them in harm's way unnecessarily or fight stupid, useless wars.
[02:38:34.896 --> 02:38:37.077]  You haven't seen him go into Venezuela.
[02:38:37.077 --> 02:38:40.340]  He wants Venezuela to change, but he's not going to risk American lives to do it.
[02:38:41.561 --> 02:38:45.324]  He wants Russia to change in certain ways, but he's not going to risk American lives to do it.
[02:38:45.324 --> 02:38:49.848]  He wants Syria to be in a different political position, but he's not going to risk American lives to do it.
[02:38:49.848 --> 02:38:55.873]  He said the only thing he was going to risk American lives for was to stop and suppress and squelch ISIS, and that's what he did.
[02:38:55.873 --> 02:38:59.156]  He did in two years what Obama said couldn't be done, period.
[02:38:59.156 --> 02:39:01.538]  And that was to wipe out ISIS off the face of the earth.
[02:39:01.818 --> 02:39:08.766]  And ISIS is an organization that, if you understand it, unlike Al-Qaeda, it has to govern territory to have political viability and appeal.
[02:39:08.766 --> 02:39:12.029]  Without territory, it has no viability and appeal because of their ideology.
[02:39:12.029 --> 02:39:16.734]  And that famous footage of Trump two years ago when the Marines' hat blows off in 100 mile an hour wind.
[02:39:17.615 --> 02:39:19.937]  It shows the good OCD.
[02:39:19.937 --> 02:39:21.879]  He doesn't like seeing collapsing cities.
[02:39:21.879 --> 02:39:23.660]  He doesn't like seeing poor people.
[02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:26.483]  He doesn't get off like leftists do.
[02:39:26.483 --> 02:39:32.548]  All these articles, they admit, typhus, black plague, leftist cities collapsing worse than Guatemala.
[02:39:32.548 --> 02:39:34.970]  And the left, why are they doing that to their cities?
[02:39:35.470 --> 02:39:37.351]  Well, because it's control.
[02:39:37.351 --> 02:39:42.694]  You have to have an excuse and a pretext for state control and for government control and for cultural control of their ideas.
[02:39:42.694 --> 02:39:46.276]  That's why you have to disown Martin Luther King and defame Martin Luther King.
[02:39:46.276 --> 02:39:50.798]  That's why you have to create viruses and diseases and create excuses.
[02:39:50.798 --> 02:39:53.299]  It was part of one of the criticisms of the medical industry.
[02:39:53.299 --> 02:39:56.201]  It's one of the only industries that makes more profit the more they make people sick.
[02:39:56.841 --> 02:39:59.883]  They have no economic interest in people actually being healthy all the time.
[02:39:59.883 --> 02:40:02.565]  Because if people are healthy all the time, they have no need for medical services.
[02:40:02.565 --> 02:40:08.709]  Definitely no need for pharmaceutical services, for certain kinds of surgical services, for certain kind of treatment services.
[02:40:08.709 --> 02:40:22.558]  So it builds, it has an economic interest and incentive in people being diseased in the same way that alcohol companies benefit from alcoholism, that gambling companies benefit from obsessive gambling disorders, that the drug dealers benefit from addiction.
[02:40:22.558 --> 02:40:26.561]  So they don't have an incentive that aligns with the public interest.
[02:40:26.561 --> 02:40:29.162]  So it's like planned obsolescence.
[02:40:29.162 --> 02:40:35.366]  I want to go to calls from Carlos, and Brian, and Matt, and Chris, and Matt, you and Joey, and Lee, and George, and Jacob, and Jefferson.
[02:40:35.366 --> 02:40:38.667]  We've got a lot to get done today, and we have big baggage coming up.
[02:40:38.667 --> 02:40:44.030]  We may take a little bit of his time, maybe the first five minutes, but then we're going to pull the ejection pin here.
[02:40:44.030 --> 02:40:47.812]  But as we go to break, I'm going to rampage through your calls.
[02:40:47.812 --> 02:40:52.034]  George, and then Joey, and then Chris, and then Brian, and Carlos, and Jefferson.
[02:40:52.034 --> 02:40:53.235]  When we come back, I want to write to you.
[02:40:54.537 --> 02:40:58.642]  For two segments, but just briefly, again, I'm gonna break this down.
[02:40:58.642 --> 02:41:01.246]  You don't go buy products at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:41:01.246 --> 02:41:02.387]  We're not on air.
[02:41:02.387 --> 02:41:04.290]  And I'm not budgeting and complaining.
[02:41:04.290 --> 02:41:05.631]  I'm in your hands.
[02:41:05.631 --> 02:41:07.454]  My destiny lies with you.
[02:41:07.454 --> 02:41:10.457]  And I think your destiny lies with me.
[02:41:10.457 --> 02:41:12.019]  So it's a symbiotic relationship.
[02:41:13.134 --> 02:41:18.817]  We have a big sale that's gotta end after this weekend because some of the products are set to sell out.

[02:42:23.204 --> 02:42:26.727]  It's a classic NASA design of that shirt I wore on Joe Rogan's.
[02:42:26.727 --> 02:42:29.248]  Everybody thought it was so great, they said, where'd I get that shirt?
[02:42:29.248 --> 02:42:34.692]  Okay, well we got one with an American flag, but it says Space Force, established 2020, 1776, so it's an original.
[02:42:37.975 --> 02:42:40.559]  And it's pre-ordered right now and you help fund it.

[02:42:51.296 --> 02:42:51.717]  Stay with us.
[02:42:55.382 --> 02:42:58.384]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[02:42:58.384 --> 02:43:00.986]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[02:43:00.986 --> 02:43:03.768]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[02:43:03.768 --> 02:43:05.749]  And the globalists are so upset.
[02:43:05.749 --> 02:43:08.571]  The problem is, people forget to take them.
[02:43:09.827 --> 02:43:14.913]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[02:43:14.913 --> 02:43:15.854]  So we looked at that.
[02:43:15.854 --> 02:43:17.496]  We made the very best a.m.

[02:44:01.844 --> 02:44:12.311]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWorksLife.com.
[02:44:12.311 --> 02:44:16.474]  This is a high-end bar sold for up to six, seven dollars at Whole Foods.
[02:44:16.474 --> 02:44:19.357]  Normally we sell it for three dollars a piece when you get it in the box.
[02:44:20.017 --> 02:44:23.760]  But with the discount we're running right now as an introductory offer, it's $2.40 a bar.
[02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:27.304]  No one can top that, and it funds Liberty and the fight against the Globalists.
[02:44:27.304 --> 02:44:30.567]  With 15 grams of protein and so much more, they're amazing.

[02:44:41.016 --> 02:44:41.397]  It's easy.
[02:44:41.937 --> 02:44:42.257]  We're good.
[02:45:05.754 --> 02:45:14.758]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:45:14.758 --> 02:45:24.841]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:45:24.841 --> 02:45:33.365]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:45:34.205 --> 02:45:35.547]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:45:35.547 --> 02:45:36.708]  You must experience it.
[02:45:36.708 --> 02:45:38.650]  It is a total game-changer.
[02:45:38.650 --> 02:45:43.715]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:45:43.715 --> 02:45:45.237]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[02:45:45.237 --> 02:45:46.718]  It lasts 10 hours.
[02:45:46.718 --> 02:45:53.405]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:45:53.405 --> 02:45:54.887]  TurboForce at MForceLife.com.
[02:45:56.482 --> 02:46:08.269]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:46:08.269 --> 02:46:14.432]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[02:46:14.432 --> 02:46:16.633]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[02:46:16.633 --> 02:46:20.776]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[02:46:21.636 --> 02:46:28.342]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.
[02:46:28.342 --> 02:46:39.052]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[02:46:39.572 --> 02:46:41.993]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[02:46:41.993 --> 02:46:46.676]  It's 50% off right now at InFourStore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[02:46:46.676 --> 02:46:49.537]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[02:46:49.537 --> 02:46:59.342]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[02:46:59.342 --> 02:47:01.964]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.050 --> 02:47:15.312]  Alex Jones here, back live with Robert Barnes.
[02:47:15.312 --> 02:47:19.015]  I'll be back this Sunday in the studio with Bob riding shotgun with me, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:47:19.015 --> 02:47:20.436]  The war room's coming up.
[02:47:20.436 --> 02:47:22.658]  But first, Dr. Nick Begich, we're on to your calls right now.
[02:47:22.658 --> 02:47:25.461]  Thanks for holding on this live Friday edition.
[02:47:25.461 --> 02:47:27.282]  We're going to go to Jefferson, Matt, and others right now.
[02:47:27.282 --> 02:47:29.805]  Jefferson in Virginia, you're on the air.
[02:47:29.805 --> 02:47:32.107]  Thanks for calling.
[02:47:32.107 --> 02:47:32.587]  Hey, gentlemen.
[02:47:32.587 --> 02:47:33.388]  Thank you for letting me on.
[02:47:33.388 --> 02:47:34.469]  Happy Friday.
[02:47:34.469 --> 02:47:34.849]  Thank you, sir.
[02:47:36.656 --> 02:47:44.442]  Uh, my question for Mr. Barnes is, uh, we have to all agree, I think, that social media has become a ghetto because they change the rules arbitrarily.
[02:47:44.442 --> 02:47:56.751]  And it would seem to me the President should have the power to threaten them with a kill switch, saying, we need to set up a hands-off list of a certain number of people that have been suspended or outlawed and put them back.
[02:47:56.751 --> 02:47:59.213]  Reinstate them and say, you have to leave them alone.
[02:47:59.213 --> 02:48:03.736]  They don't have to live by your terms of service, they just have to live by FCC rules or some
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:10.001]  Something some state of rule that's already written down.
[02:48:10.001 --> 02:48:28.945]  The purse and the power of other method mechanisms to do it so for example the president could say that nobody's going to receive any form of federal funding directly or indirectly whether it be tax benefits whether it be immunity under section 230 or whether it be direct federal government contracts unless they apply the same viewpoint non-discrimination rules that exist for other kinds
[02:48:29.025 --> 02:48:35.848]  Well, if big tech was censoring leftists, this would never happen, but they know conservatives are like, we're a free market, companies can do anything they want.
[02:48:35.848 --> 02:48:41.971]  No, not when they're bigger than governments and have been lying and have been lying on their contracts and are operating as oligopolies.
[02:48:41.971 --> 02:48:48.434]  I think the president's been building to the point where the public can accept that when he takes dramatic action, it's necessary action.
[02:48:48.434 --> 02:48:51.176]  So, like, he waited for a while to do anything about college free speech.
[02:48:51.176 --> 02:48:53.857]  He waited until it built and built and built and built.
[02:48:53.857 --> 02:48:56.098]  And then when he acted, people said, well, he had to act.
[02:48:56.098 --> 02:48:56.879]  He had no other choice.
[02:48:56.879 --> 02:48:57.519]  He's letting it ripen.
[02:48:57.819 --> 02:48:58.359]  Correct.
[02:48:58.359 --> 02:49:06.025]  But he's going to need to do it before 2019 ends, or early in 2020, because all of this is about manipulating the 2020 election outcome.
[02:49:06.025 --> 02:49:08.067]  He only faces, in my view, two threats.
[02:49:08.067 --> 02:49:10.089]  What are the 5% chance he can lose?
[02:49:10.089 --> 02:49:14.012]  The deep state taking him out, or social media manipulating the election results.
[02:49:14.012 --> 02:49:18.115]  Those are his only two threats, and those are the two he's got to be focused on through 2020.
[02:49:18.115 --> 02:49:20.557]  And again, he's 72 years old.
[02:49:20.557 --> 02:49:22.398]  His son is smart when it comes to the Internet.
[02:49:22.398 --> 02:49:23.739]  Trump's like, oh yeah, that's the Internet.
[02:49:25.060 --> 02:49:30.846]  Hey, every day there's 50 times the audience of Fox News in political debate.
[02:49:30.846 --> 02:49:36.632]  It's you Trump, it's your clips that would have been magnified to new people that are being blocked.
[02:49:36.632 --> 02:49:37.613]  You shouldn't care about...
[02:49:38.784 --> 02:49:40.405]  The geriatric Fox audience.
[02:49:40.405 --> 02:49:47.827]  No doubt, because in fact when they did a deep study, Harvard and other people looked at what social media overlapping networks really created the Trump machine.
[02:49:47.827 --> 02:49:51.088]  And they identified two sources, and it was you and Breitbart.
[02:49:51.088 --> 02:49:54.949]  And they said it was outside, and they said Fox really only existed in this world.
[02:49:54.949 --> 02:50:00.291]  It was a whole different world which had you and Breitbart as the center, and outposts of it is like Gateway Pundit, Cernovich.
[02:50:00.291 --> 02:50:03.532]  Exactly, we're like the firebases launching the tentacles out.
[02:50:03.752 --> 02:50:04.292]  Correct, exactly.
[02:50:04.292 --> 02:50:06.793]  And Trump has allowed those to be basically curtailed.
[02:50:06.793 --> 02:50:10.114]  We're trying to fire tentacles out as best we can, but... Correct, exactly.
[02:50:10.114 --> 02:50:15.895]  The problem is, they're limiting the ability for you to reach people who don't already know about you, or who don't know about your news.
[02:50:15.895 --> 02:50:20.477]  And that's what you were able to do through this sort of networking of 12 degrees of separation.
[02:50:20.477 --> 02:50:23.138]  All these people would rely upon what you did to distribute your information.
[02:50:23.138 --> 02:50:28.159]  But our listeners can still override all that by just being more earnest, more focused.
[02:50:28.359 --> 02:50:29.080]  Precisely.
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:36.926]  As long as they continue to act in dissident ways, wear their own Guy Fawkes mask of a kind, in this case an Alex Jones mask, by doing so in the social media space.
[02:50:47.094 --> 02:50:48.095]  Fox is Alex Jones.
[02:50:48.095 --> 02:50:49.437]  I'm not trying to be famous or cool.
[02:50:49.437 --> 02:50:49.837]  It's the reality.
[02:50:49.837 --> 02:50:50.237]  It's true.
[02:50:50.237 --> 02:50:54.482]  In the third dimension, they go, oh look, Jones is bullhorning the White House.
[02:50:54.482 --> 02:50:56.424]  How pathetic, Raw Story said.
[02:50:56.424 --> 02:50:58.045]  And so did Media Matters.
[02:50:58.045 --> 02:50:59.046]  Because it's not pathetic.
[02:50:59.046 --> 02:51:00.928]  They're scared of us in the third dimension.
[02:51:00.928 --> 02:51:04.312]  So they want to tell us, it's pathetic when you were all over the news.
[02:51:04.312 --> 02:51:05.833]  Just so happened Jack Dorsey was there.
[02:51:05.833 --> 02:51:06.974]  We didn't plan that.
[02:51:06.974 --> 02:51:09.857]  Oh, it was so credible the president listened and said, see Jack?
[02:51:10.598 --> 02:51:13.281]  Oh, it was so dumb that you protested.
[02:51:13.281 --> 02:51:16.964]  No, we hit a royal flush.
[02:51:16.964 --> 02:51:17.265]  Absolutely.
[02:51:17.265 --> 02:51:18.646]  What's even better than a royal flush?
[02:51:18.646 --> 02:51:20.428]  I had no idea the meeting was happening then.
[02:51:20.428 --> 02:51:26.233]  Only time ever before in the White House is when we're having a censorship meeting, and Trump and them thought I'd been tipped off.
[02:51:26.233 --> 02:51:27.134]  I later met with the U.S.
[02:51:27.134 --> 02:51:29.356]  intelligence the next day, an intelligence agency.
[02:51:29.356 --> 02:51:30.618]  They're like, so who told you?
[02:51:30.618 --> 02:51:32.059]  I'm like, no, I just showed up then.
[02:51:32.059 --> 02:51:32.760]  Precisely.
[02:51:32.760 --> 02:51:34.021]  And they're telling me how weak I am.
[02:51:34.241 --> 02:51:34.621]  Oh, of course.
[02:51:34.621 --> 02:51:35.662]  And they're going to do that.
[02:51:35.662 --> 02:51:41.926]  And the goal is sort of a mind trick on the audience to get the audience to not support the network, to not participate.
[02:51:41.926 --> 02:51:44.087]  I mean, every time... Well, they're going to call victory defeat.
[02:51:44.087 --> 02:51:44.748]  Absolutely.
[02:51:44.748 --> 02:51:48.470]  And they need the audience to not do it because they need the audience to believe they don't have the power.
[02:51:48.470 --> 02:51:53.453]  If they believe they don't have the power to change the world, then they can stop the audience from changing the world.
[02:51:53.453 --> 02:51:54.334]  Like the Einstein Institute said.
[02:51:54.494 --> 02:51:55.795]  Exactly, that's their whole thing.
[02:51:55.795 --> 02:52:04.580]  I mean, all those color revolutions, velvet, orange, rose you heard about in Eastern Europe, all of those were founded by the ideas spread by the Einstein Institute to dissidents in Eastern and Central Europe.
[02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:11.764]  They reminded them that the four pillars of public power actually had underneath it a fifth pillar of power, which was public opinion and public perception of their own power.
[02:52:11.764 --> 02:52:13.165]  Jefferson, thank you so much.
[02:52:13.165 --> 02:52:14.886]  Let's go to Matt.
[02:52:14.886 --> 02:52:17.147]  Let's go to Matt in California.
[02:52:17.147 --> 02:52:17.808]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:52:19.361 --> 02:52:20.461]  Alex Jones, what up?
[02:52:20.461 --> 02:52:21.142]  You are the man.
[02:52:21.142 --> 02:52:22.482]  Bob Barr, what's up, man?
[02:52:22.482 --> 02:52:25.603]  Hey, Infoplanet, we're winning.
[02:52:25.603 --> 02:52:33.705]  And Bob, the question is, is there any way that we could have a class action lawsuit against Twitter?
[02:52:33.705 --> 02:52:44.368]  Because I was part of a bunch of the meme war competitions, and I posted a bunch of stuff, and I was just like, why is nobody ever seeing any of this stuff?
[02:52:44.368 --> 02:52:46.549]  Turns out my logo was a
[02:52:47.245 --> 02:52:48.485]  Trump said Trump on it.
[02:52:48.485 --> 02:53:14.650]  Trump strong and it was an American flag wall and so obviously nobody ever seen it because it not only was Trump and the AI so dumb if you just say screw Alex Jones screw Trump people are doing this now then they'll share it because their minions are so dumb you look at this filth Trump trying to get blacks jobs and then oh yeah actually could we actually do them in class action for all the lost earnings
[02:53:15.179 --> 02:53:15.540]  I don't know.
[02:53:30.032 --> 02:53:30.692]  Exactly.
[02:53:30.692 --> 02:53:33.674]  So can we actually get reparations from that?
[02:53:33.674 --> 02:53:35.095]  Reparations?
[02:53:35.095 --> 02:53:44.759]  Some kind of a... Well, I'm not joking and I'm not saying you should do this, but if you said Nambla is good as your account, you would be, whatever reason, Google, Facebook, Boost, anything Nambla.
[02:53:44.759 --> 02:53:51.323]  And I'm not saying do that, but if you said adults should have sex with two-year-olds or kill babies, they would just maximize you.
[02:53:51.323 --> 02:53:52.283]  Now, I'm not joking.
[02:53:52.283 --> 02:53:56.105]  If you said, I love Satan, you will have movies made about you, it's crazy.
[02:53:56.465 --> 02:53:57.186]  No doubt.
[02:53:57.186 --> 02:54:00.309]  To his question, in fact, there will be an announcement coming up near July 4th.
[02:54:00.309 --> 02:54:02.632]  We're going to have an Independence Day announcement.
[02:54:02.632 --> 02:54:10.901]  A new Independence Day of an independent movement to create a new Southern Poverty Law Center that does what the Southern Poverty Law Center claims to do, but to actually support speech.
[02:54:10.901 --> 02:54:13.064]  A speech protection law center instead.
[02:54:13.064 --> 02:54:15.507]  A real SPLC to counter the SPLC.
[02:54:15.967 --> 02:54:30.517]  And the goal will be to create and organize together, put together a team of lawyers that brings class action cases against big tech and big media that is corrupting and corroding our democratic institutions to protect the 2020 election.
[02:54:30.517 --> 02:54:42.866]  And we're going to have, and Alex may be one of the lead participants in those class action claims, and we're going to have an announcement coming forth on July 4th that everybody can participate in, that everybody can support, that everybody can join in, and we're going to create a range of class action claims
[02:54:43.146 --> 02:55:11.965]  To equalize the playing field and to try to force big tech to be honest and honorable under the law, under the rules of contract, under the rules of equity, under the constitutional restrictions and restraints that apply to a public monopoly that dominates the public marketplace, the public square, and to reinstate free speech like they promised they would, so that the 2020 elections can be honest and honorable and up and above board, so that the people's rights and interests can be protected and their economic interests protected, such as people making t-shirts, people who have monetized their social media for the purposes
[02:55:12.245 --> 02:55:19.990]  And so many times what I've seen with Trump and other great leaders is when the grassroots takes action he respects, that's why he reads the mail coming in, he takes random phone calls, he respects that raw intel.
[02:55:34.418 --> 02:55:34.838]  Absolutely.
[02:55:34.838 --> 02:55:44.304]  And so when we take action, when the listeners take action against this, organically, that signals other leaders above us to get involved.
[02:55:44.304 --> 02:55:44.784]  Precisely.
[02:55:44.784 --> 02:55:46.605]  So we're sending the orders up.
[02:55:46.605 --> 02:55:47.486]  People don't get this.
[02:55:47.486 --> 02:55:49.047]  We're in command.
[02:55:49.047 --> 02:55:49.787]  Look at what happened.
[02:55:49.787 --> 02:55:57.852]  Once they created a private fund to build the wall, it wasn't like the private fund was going to be able to achieve building the wall, but it sent the message to the president, look how much money was raised to build the wall.
[02:55:58.232 --> 02:56:01.834]  Then by people who knew that that money likely would never get to get spent on building a wall.
[02:56:01.834 --> 02:56:03.574]  They end up building about a mile or so.
[02:56:03.574 --> 02:56:04.395]  They've worked hard on it.
[02:56:04.395 --> 02:56:05.475]  I know the people doing it.
[02:56:05.475 --> 02:56:07.696]  But it's stunts that launched this country.
[02:56:07.696 --> 02:56:08.396]  Absolutely.
[02:56:08.396 --> 02:56:09.237]  It's what drew it.
[02:56:09.237 --> 02:56:10.557]  It drew public attention.
[02:56:10.557 --> 02:56:15.059]  The president realized, wow, these people are willing to back their ideas with their actual money and cash.
[02:56:15.059 --> 02:56:17.740]  And so in winning and he's a businessman like anyone else.
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:19.761]  And when he sees that, he says, OK, this is serious.
[02:56:19.761 --> 02:56:20.822]  This is significant.
[02:56:20.822 --> 02:56:22.282]  I have to pay attention to this.
[02:56:22.282 --> 02:56:23.543]  I have to take action on it.
[02:56:23.883 --> 02:56:27.066]  I mean, it's one of the reasons why he had great respect for the InfoWars audience.
[02:56:27.066 --> 02:56:33.572]  First major presidential candidate to publicly appear, constantly publicly support, say publicly positive things, retweet out accounts.
[02:56:33.572 --> 02:56:41.480]  And by the way, they tried to have, I think it's QAnon, it's a bunch of different people, some of it real, some of it not, claim Trump doesn't like me, and then Trump tweets a bunch of our stuff.
[02:56:41.480 --> 02:56:42.180]  They don't know what to do.
[02:56:42.180 --> 02:56:45.483]  That was Trump literally saying, no, I'm with InfoWars.
[02:56:45.483 --> 02:56:48.026]  And that totally has sent the whole system into a hissy fit.
[02:56:48.266 --> 02:57:01.077]  Because Trump knows the powers of the grassroots, the 1776, the real blood of Americana, which we're just one system of, and the fact that after all the demonization, he didn't forsake us, it just sends them into panic mode.
[02:57:01.077 --> 02:57:01.678]  Absolutely.
[02:57:01.678 --> 02:57:09.345]  What it was, is it was the... Trump respects an audience that puts action behind their words, and the Infowars audience has always done that.
[02:57:09.345 --> 02:57:13.989]  So part of the reason to build this public platform is not just to bring the public litigation that needs to be brought,
[02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.789]  That's right.
[02:57:14.789 --> 02:57:19.472]  The communications of citizens in the modern telecommunications system is essential to a free and open republic.
[02:57:19.472 --> 02:57:24.175]  We're going to come back with more calls and then Dr. Nick Baggage takes over from Alaska with big breaking news.
[02:57:24.175 --> 02:57:24.856]  Stay there.
[02:57:24.856 --> 02:57:26.557]  Hour number four is only two minutes away.
[02:57:45.225 --> 02:57:48.828]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.828 --> 02:57:50.589]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.589 --> 02:58:02.659]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.659 --> 02:58:07.683]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[02:58:08.123 --> 02:58:08.564]  Let's do it!
[02:58:25.501 --> 02:58:27.223]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.223 --> 02:58:37.214]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.214 --> 02:58:39.877]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[02:58:39.877 --> 02:58:44.583]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[02:58:48.146 --> 02:58:50.087]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:58:50.087 --> 02:58:50.887]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:58:50.887 --> 02:58:52.247]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:58:52.247 --> 02:58:53.768]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:58:53.768 --> 02:58:54.568]  I'm so excited.
[02:58:54.568 --> 02:58:55.468]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:58:55.468 --> 02:58:57.949]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:58:57.949 --> 02:59:00.450]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:59:00.450 --> 02:59:01.871]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:01.871 --> 02:59:03.311]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:03.311 --> 02:59:04.711]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:04.711 --> 02:59:05.972]  The Bone Broth.
[02:59:05.972 --> 02:59:10.713]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:59:10.713 --> 02:59:12.034]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:12.034 --> 02:59:13.474]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:13.474 --> 02:59:14.715]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:59:15.495 --> 02:59:16.175]  Good!
[02:59:16.175 --> 02:59:16.796]  Whoa!
[02:59:16.796 --> 02:59:18.497]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:18.497 --> 02:59:22.699]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride 3 toothpaste.
[02:59:22.699 --> 02:59:26.502]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:59:26.502 --> 02:59:28.523]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:59:28.523 --> 02:59:31.085]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[02:59:31.085 --> 02:59:31.845]  I'm thanking you.
[02:59:31.845 --> 02:59:38.289]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:59:38.289 --> 02:59:39.030]  It is next level.
[02:59:39.030 --> 02:59:39.690]  It really is good.
[02:59:39.690 --> 02:59:40.230]  So thank you.
[02:59:40.230 --> 02:59:42.151]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:42.151 --> 02:59:42.532]  Thank you.
[02:59:48.849 --> 02:59:57.454]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:57.454 --> 02:59:59.155]  Big Brother.
[02:59:59.155 --> 03:00:01.477]  Mainstream media.
[03:00:01.477 --> 03:00:03.278]  Government cover-ups.
[03:00:03.278 --> 03:00:05.379]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:05.379 --> 03:00:07.500]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:07.500 --> 03:00:12.203]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:13.257 --> 03:00:18.580]  Well, we're going into sudden death overtime, and Begich, who I love to death, is a great scientist, and he's cool.
[03:00:18.580 --> 03:00:20.360]  We're taking the next ten minutes, too.
[03:00:20.360 --> 03:00:24.442]  So, this segment, next segment of calls, we get to everybody that's holding.
[03:00:24.442 --> 03:00:26.163]  Let's go to Chris in Illinois.
[03:00:26.163 --> 03:00:28.484]  You're on the air with Robert Barnes.
[03:00:28.484 --> 03:00:30.145]  That's not Bob Barr, the Attorney General.
[03:00:30.145 --> 03:00:31.126]  That's Robert Barnes.
[03:00:31.126 --> 03:00:36.988]  Somebody was calling you Bob, so somebody was calling you Attorney General earlier, which is fine.
[03:00:36.988 --> 03:00:38.369]  You've gotten promoted.
[03:00:38.369 --> 03:00:39.390]  Chris in Illinois, you're on the air.
[03:00:39.390 --> 03:00:39.970]  Thanks for calling.
[03:00:41.468 --> 03:00:42.468]  Good afternoon, fellas.
[03:00:42.468 --> 03:00:44.449]  This is Dodger Bullets here in Chicago.
[03:00:44.449 --> 03:00:49.331]  I know you don't like compliments, Alex, but my compliment is this.
[03:00:49.331 --> 03:00:58.255]  I've been listening to you guys for about 10 years, and around work and a lot of my neighbors, you know, I have enough knowledge now.
[03:00:58.255 --> 03:01:01.756]  I feel like I have my PhD talking about a lot of this stuff.
[03:01:01.756 --> 03:01:07.919]  And I actually have a lot of people that will sort of come to me and say, hey, what do you think is going to happen next?
[03:01:07.919 --> 03:01:08.719]  Because typically,
[03:01:09.915 --> 03:01:13.556]  I'm spot on, and that's basically from listening to you guys.
[03:01:13.556 --> 03:01:31.280]  But my comment about Kushner is, you know, way back, I remember one of the interviews you did with Phyllis Schlafly, and one of the things she said that really woke me up was how she was talking about how bipartisanship is essentially the fox in the henhouse.
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:36.861]  And my concern with Kushner is, first of all, I think his dad has a lot of skeletons, which is puzzling to me.
[03:01:38.082 --> 03:01:40.683]  Uh, the globalists haven't come after him in that regard.
[03:01:40.683 --> 03:01:44.744]  Sure, and paying twice as much as you should for 666 Park Avenue?
[03:01:44.744 --> 03:01:45.344]  Yeah.
[03:01:45.344 --> 03:01:49.565]  Well, his dad is also, on record, is probably the dumbest criminal of all time.
[03:01:49.565 --> 03:01:53.026]  I mean, he managed to get himself convicted by Chris Christie.
[03:01:53.026 --> 03:01:55.767]  So the, uh, hopefully the... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[03:01:55.767 --> 03:01:56.387]  Next segment.
[03:01:56.387 --> 03:01:57.787]  Start of the next segment, tell that story.
[03:01:57.787 --> 03:01:58.427]  Sure.
[03:01:58.427 --> 03:02:00.388]  Uh, go ahead, Chris.
[03:02:01.564 --> 03:02:13.309]  So basically, you know, in the same way when conservatives always lose with bipartisanship, such as gun control laws, the Patriot Act, you know, patriots end up getting pissed on with this stuff.
[03:02:13.309 --> 03:02:14.910]  It sounds good, right?
[03:02:14.910 --> 03:02:25.335]  But I'm afraid Kushner might walk in, and the globalists know they're on the rope, and so perhaps he would take some kind of deal, you know, because their goal is essentially to buy time.
[03:02:25.335 --> 03:02:29.817]  And right now, with the rise of populism and nationalism globally, as we saw last weekend,
[03:02:30.599 --> 03:02:31.820]  They've got to buy some time.
[03:02:31.820 --> 03:02:33.641]  And I think that's what concerns me.
[03:02:33.641 --> 03:02:34.082]  I agree with you.
[03:02:34.082 --> 03:02:35.563]  Kushner tends to try to make deals.
[03:02:35.563 --> 03:02:38.044]  He's more of a Democrat from New York.
[03:02:38.044 --> 03:02:40.486]  But Kushner doesn't make the deals.
[03:02:40.486 --> 03:02:42.628]  Trump approves them.
[03:02:42.628 --> 03:02:47.051]  So I'm just saying it isn't Trump joining Milderberg to send a representative there.
[03:02:47.871 --> 03:02:51.733]  Our whole point was forcing the fact that Bilderberg exists out in the open.
[03:02:51.733 --> 03:02:52.013]  No doubt.
[03:02:52.013 --> 03:02:59.837]  And Trump is the first president in forever to never go to Bohemian Grove and to never have previously gone and participated in Bilderberg.
[03:02:59.837 --> 03:03:07.501]  So the fact that he's sending Kushner there to get intel, which is how Kushner will be seen as like them to the Bilderberg elites.
[03:03:07.981 --> 03:03:10.862]  But Trump doesn't care about that because Kushner makes no decisions.
[03:03:10.862 --> 03:03:18.326]  Kushner's there to provide intel to the President as to what they're thinking about, what they're talking about, what they're strategizing, what's going on.
[03:03:18.326 --> 03:03:24.208]  He wants to be inside the room rather than outside the room to know what the deal is so he can make his own determinations and decisions.
[03:03:24.208 --> 03:03:29.030]  Anybody that's been around Trump any time in his life knows he makes his own decisions on his own mind.
[03:03:29.030 --> 03:03:31.411]  Kushner's only impact is to provide him information.
[03:03:31.411 --> 03:03:34.413]  Kushner's making no decisions at all inside the White House.
[03:03:34.413 --> 03:03:36.093]  And that's good for a lot of reasons.
[03:03:36.093 --> 03:03:36.894]  Chris, appreciate the call.
[03:03:36.894 --> 03:03:37.314]  Great point.
[03:03:38.584 --> 03:03:42.605]  And I get criticizing Kushner, and I defend people that want to criticize him.
[03:03:42.605 --> 03:03:44.426]  I just think, I totally agree with you.
[03:03:44.426 --> 03:03:51.288]  Kushner's well-spoken, he gets around, he's slick with establishment people, and he goes and reports to Trump.
[03:03:51.288 --> 03:03:56.090]  And I always keep hearing about Kushner's running days, and I just don't think that's the case.
[03:03:56.090 --> 03:03:56.910]  No, not at all.
[03:03:56.910 --> 03:04:02.272]  And in fact, I think Trump deliberately leaks that because he wants these people to give Kushner more information than they would otherwise give him.
[03:04:02.652 --> 03:04:09.415]  In order for them to be feel trusting and confident around him, you need Kushner meeting with Kissinger once a month like he's been doing.
[03:04:09.415 --> 03:04:13.917]  You need Kushner meeting with some members of the sort of the elitist structure that operates throughout the world.
[03:04:13.917 --> 03:04:15.078]  Keep the enemies closer.
[03:04:15.078 --> 03:04:15.518]  Exactly.
[03:04:15.518 --> 03:04:17.379]  You got to know what they're thinking, know what they're talking about.
[03:04:17.639 --> 03:04:20.681]  And the only way that works is if the world thinks Kushner has real power.
[03:04:20.681 --> 03:04:23.142]  So he's got to let people think Kushner has real power.
[03:04:23.142 --> 03:04:30.105]  But anybody that knows Trump knows the probability he's letting anybody dictate to him anything, doesn't know Trump at all.
[03:04:30.105 --> 03:04:33.927]  Trump responds to public demand of the public interest and the public audience.
[03:04:33.927 --> 03:04:39.150]  He doesn't take dictation from any individual as to what he has to do or do.
[03:04:39.150 --> 03:04:42.571]  But people don't get any polling.
[03:04:42.571 --> 03:04:45.373]  But a random phone call, a woman handed him a piece of paper?
[03:04:45.373 --> 03:04:45.493]  Yes.
[03:04:46.013 --> 03:04:49.937]  He takes the, what the InfoWars audience is doing and acting, that he will act upon.
[03:04:49.937 --> 03:04:51.818]  And that's why they established it once it cut off.
[03:04:51.818 --> 03:04:52.239]  Absolutely.
[03:05:12.037 --> 03:05:13.258]  We're at NewsWars.com.
[03:05:13.258 --> 03:05:15.660]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[03:05:15.660 --> 03:05:16.581]  We have our own videos.
[03:05:16.581 --> 03:05:17.602]  We have our own articles.
[03:05:17.602 --> 03:05:22.406]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[03:05:22.406 --> 03:05:24.668]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:05:24.668 --> 03:05:29.592]  InfoWars.com, man!
[03:05:29.592 --> 03:05:29.652]  Woo!
[03:05:31.019 --> 03:05:34.202]  InfoWars.com, because that's what people out here are talking about.
[03:05:34.202 --> 03:05:35.603]  InfoWars.com.
[03:05:35.603 --> 03:05:38.326]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:05:38.326 --> 03:05:40.568]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:05:40.568 --> 03:05:44.051]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:05:44.051 --> 03:05:46.794]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:05:46.794 --> 03:05:49.076]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:05:49.076 --> 03:05:50.177]  That's where they find it.
[03:05:50.177 --> 03:05:52.058]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:05:52.058 --> 03:05:52.479]  Just go there.
[03:06:01.494 --> 03:06:09.991]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:06:43.309 --> 03:06:51.094]  Broadcasting worldwide, cramming in as many phone calls as we can before Dr. Nick Baggage closes out the Friday transmission.
[03:06:52.674 --> 03:06:54.819]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is here.
[03:06:54.819 --> 03:06:59.168]  Briefly, because you're an expert on Robert Mueller.
[03:06:59.168 --> 03:06:59.809]  You exposed that.
[03:06:59.809 --> 03:07:00.390]  It's all come out.
[03:07:01.445 --> 03:07:05.548]  You were getting into Kushner and his father.
[03:07:05.548 --> 03:07:07.989]  And, again, don't judge a son by his father.
[03:07:07.989 --> 03:07:12.352]  God, don't judge people for if their family ten generations ago had slaves.
[03:07:12.352 --> 03:07:13.733]  So I'm not here to defend Kushner.
[03:07:13.733 --> 03:07:17.115]  I'm just not here to say Kushner's bad because his dad went to jail.
[03:07:17.115 --> 03:07:20.537]  But you were telling me the way he went was just stupid.
[03:07:20.537 --> 03:07:21.078]  Oh, completely.
[03:07:21.078 --> 03:07:25.461]  I use him as one of the examples of, yeah, those sort of America's Dumbest Criminals Awards and those kind of things.
[03:07:25.461 --> 03:07:25.981]  Darwin Awards.
[03:07:26.021 --> 03:07:26.622]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:07:26.622 --> 03:07:32.227]  People who leave their driver's license at the place, at the bank, where they just committed robbery.
[03:07:32.227 --> 03:07:33.809]  That's basically what Kushner's dad did.
[03:07:33.809 --> 03:07:40.335]  Or guys that rob a house, kill the woman, like just happened in Austin, and they take the credit card and the woman's cell phone and they're using it on the road?
[03:07:40.335 --> 03:07:41.537]  The cops go right there?
[03:07:41.537 --> 03:07:42.237]  Correct, exactly.
[03:07:42.237 --> 03:07:43.939]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[03:07:44.259 --> 03:07:54.605]  So basically Kushner's dad could have dodged all the problems, but he tried to set up his own in-laws and other relations with this bogus hooker thing, and then he tried to create another fake thing to set somebody else up.
[03:07:54.605 --> 03:07:57.167]  That all got him much deeper into trouble.
[03:08:00.669 --> 03:08:04.970]  So yeah, so Kushner's dad basically bought himself a ticket to prison with his own stupidity.
[03:08:04.970 --> 03:08:09.252]  By taking you, somebody who, I use as an example to clients and say, this is what not to do.
[03:08:09.252 --> 03:08:09.852]  Don't do this, don't do this.
[03:08:09.852 --> 03:08:16.174]  But was it that he was so smart, but had gotten away with stuff forever, he thought some elaborate one-dimensional scheme.
[03:08:16.174 --> 03:08:24.917]  If something's incredibly elaborate, but it doesn't think about the next step, it's still one-dimensional, the only good one-dimensional thing would be something super simple.
[03:08:24.917 --> 03:08:27.618]  Something one-dimensional and super complex is going to fail.
[03:08:28.038 --> 03:08:28.719]  Absolutely.
[03:08:28.719 --> 03:08:32.444]  It's the reason why so many of the people that are caught criminals in prison have low IQs.
[03:08:32.444 --> 03:08:34.326]  Because they're one-step thinkers, not two-step thinkers.
[03:08:34.326 --> 03:08:38.612]  They think, purse nice, what like to steal, not what happens if I get caught.
[03:08:38.612 --> 03:08:39.834]  So that's what Kushner's dad was.
[03:08:39.834 --> 03:08:43.819]  So that's why I really do hope the genetic part of his IQ came from his mom.
[03:08:44.279 --> 03:08:51.422]  But I made the point that there's also, me and my buddy call really rich, institutional wealth people aliens.
[03:08:51.422 --> 03:09:05.127]  Because they don't even know how to clean their car, how to change a tire, and they've gotten away with stuff so long, it's not that their IQ is even low, it's their cultural IQ is so low, or their societal IQ, they're experiential.
[03:09:05.127 --> 03:09:09.029]  They don't get like, dude, you're gonna get caught with a super elaborate framing plan.
[03:09:09.249 --> 03:09:12.851]  There are people who have been removed from consequences in their life.
[03:09:12.851 --> 03:09:19.133]  So to some degree, what happened to his dad probably was highly educational and beneficial to Kushner, avoiding the same consequence and outcome.
[03:09:19.133 --> 03:09:23.616]  Because he got to see what the real consequences were of that kind of insular conduct.
[03:09:23.616 --> 03:09:28.318]  And so it probably provided him a life edge that he would not otherwise have, and he would probably be less useful for the president.
[03:09:29.178 --> 03:09:31.700]  Just briefly, I'm going to hit a few calls here.
[03:09:31.700 --> 03:09:35.464]  I've read about the story, but you broke it down a few weeks ago to me, really.
[03:09:35.464 --> 03:09:36.304]  What happened?
[03:09:36.304 --> 03:09:43.491]  So, I mean, basically he did have some tax and a range of issues, but the people turning him in were his own sister-in-law and other people, his other close family members.
[03:09:43.491 --> 03:09:47.995]  So he tried to set them up with bogus hookers and in different, tried to set up her husband with a bogus hooker.
[03:09:48.035 --> 03:09:48.615]  We're good to go.
[03:10:16.292 --> 03:10:17.273]  And that's who he was.
[03:10:17.273 --> 03:10:29.482]  But it did help the son in the sense that the son, unlike everyone else in his privileged group of upbringing, recognized what consequences can happen when you don't plan ahead, when you're not strategic, and when you think your own world is the only world that exists.
[03:10:29.482 --> 03:10:34.846]  And that's probably why he has been so much more beneficial to the president than he would have been without that life experience.
[03:10:34.846 --> 03:10:36.468]  And then the incestuousness of it.
[03:10:37.128 --> 03:10:43.212]  And that Chris Christie's in with Trump and everything, but then Kushner's in, and you know, Kushner doesn't like Chris Christie.
[03:10:43.212 --> 03:10:43.732]  Right.
[03:10:43.732 --> 03:10:46.794]  You knew sooner or later Chris Christie wasn't making it to the dance.
[03:10:46.794 --> 03:10:48.915]  So that's why he was the first guy to endorse Trump.
[03:10:48.915 --> 03:10:51.777]  He was hoping to overcome the fact that he put Kushner's dad in.
[03:10:51.777 --> 03:10:53.578]  I'm always impressed how much research you've done.
[03:10:53.578 --> 03:10:58.821]  We were talking to Pattis, a great lawyer up in Connecticut for the Sandy Hook political suits.
[03:10:58.821 --> 03:11:00.942]  He's like, wow, I've actually watched all the videos.
[03:11:00.942 --> 03:11:02.142]  You never even said what they said.
[03:11:02.142 --> 03:11:03.443]  It is all edited.
[03:11:03.443 --> 03:11:04.184]  Barnes is right.
[03:11:05.180 --> 03:11:10.304]  But he's a great guy, but he was kind of reactively still like halfway believing what they say.
[03:11:10.304 --> 03:11:11.665]  You'd actually gone and looked at it all.
[03:11:11.665 --> 03:11:13.326]  I mean, they just lie about everything.
[03:11:13.326 --> 03:11:13.746]  Oh, completely.
[03:11:13.746 --> 03:11:14.727]  Not the families, the lawyers.
[03:11:14.727 --> 03:11:15.327]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:11:15.327 --> 03:11:15.808]  Exactly.
[03:11:15.808 --> 03:11:22.392]  And what's happened is you had the Connecticut lawsuit was based on a bunch of claims that they had to have known or should have known didn't exist.
[03:11:22.392 --> 03:11:24.794]  They were based on made up facts that just didn't happen.
[03:11:25.174 --> 03:11:29.376]  You know, there was no marketing or targeting of people in the manner that they were talking about.
[03:11:29.376 --> 03:11:31.536]  There was no attempts to target people.
[03:11:31.536 --> 03:11:35.598]  Yeah, they act like one news story is like the Holy Grail of cash machine shootout.
[03:11:35.598 --> 03:11:39.620]  We have hundreds of videos today, stacks of articles, guests.
[03:11:39.620 --> 03:11:48.243]  They're saying that I'm living off this when it's really those Democrat lawyers and those groups that have been getting in office, milking it, getting contributions the American way.
[03:11:48.783 --> 03:11:50.866]  Uh, families that have been caught keeping money?
[03:11:50.866 --> 03:11:54.190]  The truth is this is all coming out and they don't know the tar baby they've gotten involved in.
[03:11:54.190 --> 03:12:02.499]  We didn't make a damn dime off barely covering it and then they get to cover it and bring it back up in my name and that's what's sick.
[03:12:02.499 --> 03:12:06.184]  They hold me up like a ventriloquist and go, Alex Jones!
[03:12:06.184 --> 03:12:07.725]  Nobody died!
[03:12:07.725 --> 03:12:08.907]  He's hurting the families!
[03:12:09.229 --> 03:12:10.711]  And it's the lawyers doing it!
[03:12:10.711 --> 03:12:16.979]  Right, and I think what happened is the lawyers got caught in Connecticut actually believing press coverage.
[03:12:16.979 --> 03:12:20.483]  They really believed the politicians, they really believed the press, they really believed Media Matters.
[03:12:20.483 --> 03:12:22.085]  They assumed all that was accurate.
[03:12:22.085 --> 03:12:25.789]  I mean, even Joe Rogan said at one point he had believed that what Media Matters put out was accurate.
[03:12:25.789 --> 03:12:27.792]  He didn't realize until later it was completely inaccurate.
[03:12:28.192 --> 03:12:34.657]  And the way Media Matters disguises the truth is they will bury within the article or their publication the actual whole video.
[03:12:34.657 --> 03:12:38.659]  And if you go and watch the whole video, you realize, oh, they're completely mischaracterizing what took place here.
[03:12:38.659 --> 03:12:44.163]  They're completely mischaracterizing the conversation, they're completely mischaracterizing the scope of the issues, etc.
[03:12:44.163 --> 03:12:45.364]  But they don't do that.
[03:12:45.364 --> 03:12:54.791]  So that's where if you've read and reviewed InfoWars during the entire time period, 90-95% of all coverage does not say that Sandy Hook didn't happen, admits and acknowledges Sandy Hook did happen.
[03:12:55.171 --> 03:13:06.646]  So that in fact what the issue was whether or not politicians were coming up with a different reason as to why Sandy Hook happened and they wanted to only the politicians in the press only wanted to blame a gun.
[03:13:06.646 --> 03:13:08.148]  They didn't want to blame the shooter.
[03:13:08.148 --> 03:13:10.050]  They didn't want to blame mental health treatment.
[03:13:10.050 --> 03:13:11.873]  They didn't want to blame psychotropic drugs.
[03:13:12.193 --> 03:13:14.936]  They didn't want to blame school security.
[03:13:14.936 --> 03:13:20.343]  They didn't want to blame school systems that didn't make the very simple choice of allowing teachers the means of locking their own doors.
[03:13:20.343 --> 03:13:28.792]  I mean, it's one thing to do the Israeli mechanism of protecting schools, where teachers are trained and have arms available to them, where they have not experienced any of these kind of incidents.
[03:13:28.792 --> 03:13:31.455]  Because Islamists know somebody's waiting for you with an AR-15.
[03:13:32.096 --> 03:13:32.756]  Correct, exactly.
[03:13:44.781 --> 03:13:51.428]  There's going to be a ruling in the third Sandy Hook suit filed here in Austin, where I was sued by someone's name I never even said.
[03:13:51.428 --> 03:13:53.670]  All the law says you can't do that.
[03:13:53.670 --> 03:13:57.734]  But you're predicting they'll still push it on, it'll go to appeal, and then come back.
[03:13:57.734 --> 03:13:59.776]  It'll obviously go nowhere in the future.
[03:13:59.776 --> 03:14:01.097]  But that's why they're so upset.
[03:14:01.097 --> 03:14:02.098]  But they used
[03:14:02.839 --> 03:14:10.721]  Basically, these disingenuous lawsuits, as the perception of my guilt for the deplatforming, show their victory has already happened.
[03:14:10.721 --> 03:14:16.363]  The politicians and the press continue to misuse and mischaracterize these suits for their own partisan and personal purposes.
[03:14:16.363 --> 03:14:18.764]  Ultimately, there will be a decision.
[03:14:18.764 --> 03:14:25.866]  I think the court is a very thoughtful court, is concerned with the First Amendment limitations, has spoken about the significance of the constitutional issues involved.
[03:14:26.446 --> 03:14:33.329]  And it's torn between the emotional safety appeal of the plaintiffs versus the First Amendment appeal that we are making.
[03:14:33.329 --> 03:14:41.952]  And so whichever way the court decides, and I think it's 50-50 which way the court goes, but ultimately this is going to, whether we appeal it or whether they appeal it, it's going to go up on appeal.
[03:14:41.952 --> 03:14:44.773]  So this is a decision that needs to be made by the highest court in the land.
[03:14:44.773 --> 03:14:46.174]  But they're going to run it as another victory.
[03:14:46.174 --> 03:14:46.774]  No, no.
[03:14:46.774 --> 03:14:49.075]  These courts are all punting to the appeal.
[03:14:49.355 --> 03:14:49.615]  Correct.
[03:14:49.615 --> 03:14:56.423]  I mean, all of them know that this is... But if the appeals courts say you can sue somebody when you hadn't said their name, the country's gonna be shut down by lawsuits.
[03:14:56.423 --> 03:14:57.144]  That's what's gonna happen.
[03:14:57.144 --> 03:14:59.867]  The press is gonna not be able to function as a free press.
[03:14:59.867 --> 03:15:04.072]  And like you said to me, even CNN in the Covington is arguing what you're saying now.
[03:15:04.572 --> 03:15:06.114]  So they can't have Kanania too?
[03:15:06.114 --> 03:15:06.474]  Exactly.
[03:15:06.474 --> 03:15:11.298]  CNN admits that your legal position in this case is the correct constitutional position.
[03:15:11.298 --> 03:15:16.063]  So they've admitted that in their filings and the Sandman-related suits out of Kentucky.
[03:15:16.063 --> 03:15:22.369]  So all we're arguing is that we should have the same standards for everybody in the press, same standards for everybody in speech.
[03:15:22.369 --> 03:15:25.592]  And this is significant and you're the tip of the spear to protect the freedom of the press.
[03:15:25.592 --> 03:15:26.873]  And what did the judge say when you said that in court?
[03:15:27.473 --> 03:15:33.417]  The judge said he takes it very seriously, he wants to make it thoughtful and make an intelligent review, and he's torn by what to do.
[03:15:33.417 --> 03:15:38.481]  And so I think he's going to make the best decision he knows how, and whichever way it goes, ultimately it's a decision that the U.S.
[03:15:38.481 --> 03:15:40.362]  Supreme Court's going to have to stay by.
[03:15:40.362 --> 03:15:47.007]  And I think the fundamental decision to protect free press and free speech in this country will have the name Alex Jones in its title.
[03:15:47.007 --> 03:15:48.167]  Well, listeners, we love you.

[03:20:34.804 --> 03:20:39.666]  I appreciate, you know, kind of the beginning of this show, you know, we sort of ended on
[03:20:41.546 --> 03:20:45.407]  A note again of all the news, you know, sort of compiled in the week.
[03:20:45.407 --> 03:20:47.629]  It's sort of compressing in the week.
[03:20:47.629 --> 03:21:06.938]  And, you know, I don't know whether anyone knows it or not outside of Alaska, but certainly here in Alaska, we know the Attorney General Barr is currently touring our state, meeting with indigenous peoples out in really rural Alaska, in the sense of being off the main road system, getting an appreciation for what
[03:21:07.618 --> 03:21:08.419]  Alaska is.
[03:21:08.419 --> 03:21:18.165]  You know, we have 70 communities in Alaska without police protection as a basic thing in government services.
[03:21:18.165 --> 03:21:19.125]  We don't have it.
[03:21:19.125 --> 03:21:20.526]  I mean, none.
[03:21:20.526 --> 03:21:33.354]  You may have a hostage situation, which we often do here in Alaska, and it might be, you know, six, eight hours before someone shows up because, you know, it takes that long to organize it and get there.
[03:21:33.354 --> 03:21:34.755]  And sometimes even longer.
[03:21:34.755 --> 03:21:36.336]  If the weather's bad, it could be days.
[03:21:36.997 --> 03:21:50.429]  And so 70 communities off of roads, half of those don't have sewer systems running water, you know, kind of what, you know, we're building toilets in Afghanistan and around the world, but
[03:21:51.127 --> 03:21:54.090]  Not in America, no way.
[03:21:54.090 --> 03:22:09.163]  So, bars touring around and getting a sense of what justice is in a frontier world, a third world within a first world nation, which is what a lot of, unfortunately, rural Alaska is, as I think about it today.
[03:22:09.163 --> 03:22:17.371]  And the other announcement today, the big one, is British Petroleum said the single biggest undeveloped oil
[03:22:18.031 --> 03:22:27.857]  Or excuse me and gas gas particularly field in the world is the North Slope of Alaska and the region around it and this is a massive.
[03:22:29.089 --> 03:22:29.770]  Oil Basin.
[03:22:29.770 --> 03:22:34.212]  In fact, here's my predictions for the next three years given what I've been reading.
[03:22:34.212 --> 03:22:37.713]  So this isn't some metaphysical nonsense.
[03:22:37.713 --> 03:22:53.861]  This is based on reading the literature and what's going on on the North Slope with the large globalist multinational companies as well as the smaller domestic Texas based predominantly and then some Australian based companies actually.
[03:22:54.722 --> 03:23:04.472]  Looking at the North Slope oil basins, when you look at the very top of the state above the furthest mountain range, that entire area is essentially an oil and gas basin.
[03:23:04.472 --> 03:23:12.421]  And if you look at the map that's up, if you're able to see this on screen, all the offshore areas in the light blue that are the light shallow
[03:23:13.697 --> 03:23:13.877]  I think?
[03:23:33.587 --> 03:23:43.489]  Now it's been producing about 500,000, more or less, half a million barrels a day for the last few years and declining and then going up and declining.
[03:23:43.489 --> 03:23:54.551]  But there's, in my view, there'll be another half a million barrels online and flowing within, I would say, five years, just given what's been discovered on the North Slope.
[03:23:54.551 --> 03:24:03.012]  And the smaller companies, the non-global companies, the domestic companies, don't think of this resource as a warehouse, you know, where they just
[03:24:03.012 --> 03:24:12.077]  Just keep it in the ground like a safety deposit box, because hey, you can exploit the world where they might throw you out and keep your oil in the ground here, but it's not really their oil.
[03:24:12.077 --> 03:24:15.198]  It's yours and my oil, and there's no performance requirements.
[03:24:15.198 --> 03:24:17.059]  They don't have to produce anything.
[03:24:17.059 --> 03:24:26.184]  So they're warehousing it, and now some of the other companies, Armstrong just sold a chunk of their rights, 400 million bucks, they got a 450 million dollar option on
[03:24:26.985 --> 03:24:37.058]  Remaining rights to two really impressive fields and a bunch of other things happening in Alaska with Armstrong and oil search and a bunch of others.
[03:24:37.058 --> 03:24:41.965]  But big things in oil and gas is the point.
[03:24:41.965 --> 03:24:43.047]  And yet we have this
[03:24:44.762 --> 03:24:59.832]  whole primitive thing going on within our state in terms of being able to access roads or infrastructure of any kind and police protection and water and sewer and the basic things most of us take for granted.
[03:24:59.832 --> 03:25:04.535]  And so the opportunities to in rural Alaska are huge.
[03:25:04.535 --> 03:25:06.337]  Behind me on the screen is a
[03:25:07.959 --> 03:25:08.900]  In the Wrangell St.
[03:25:08.900 --> 03:25:14.649]  Elias area and this is a property with partners I have up there and this is a big
[03:25:15.742 --> 03:25:17.503]  Uh, mineral zone as well.
[03:25:17.503 --> 03:25:19.044]  It's just a beautiful place.
[03:25:19.044 --> 03:25:30.689]  You know, but the thing is, Alaska has a lot of things that are that, in fact, the National Treasury is something I talked about a lot, and it's good to see national leaders looking at some of the problems of Alaska.
[03:25:30.689 --> 03:25:36.692]  And at the same time, from my perspective, the challenge that they present is also the opportunity to open up
[03:25:37.350 --> 03:25:42.315]  Regions of the country that offer the country great opportunity.
[03:25:42.315 --> 03:25:45.498]  There's a railroad being discussed now, privately funded even.
[03:25:45.498 --> 03:25:56.750]  They're discussing privately funding a railroad link, something that those have listened to me on this broadcast and others over the last couple of years have heard me talking about and we're seeing it moving forward.
[03:25:56.750 --> 03:25:58.472]  You know, those are all good, positive
[03:25:59.239 --> 03:25:59.619]  I think?
[03:26:17.068 --> 03:26:20.409]  Building stuff, you know, making stuff happen, you know.
[03:26:20.409 --> 03:26:33.935]  My good friend Dave Cuddy, who's from a multi-generational banking family here and he has a really great background in economics, was with me and we were discussing sort of the national scene and
[03:26:34.595 --> 03:26:51.151]  Having an understanding of not just the P&L but the balance sheet, you know, what are the resources, you know, and how are we deploying those in a meaningful way and in we were talking about taxes and taxation and how, you know, how much you end up paying and the bottom line to all of that is that the resentment isn't
[03:26:51.969 --> 03:26:57.553]  Paying it, you know, it's how it's being spent, you know, and fiddled away.
[03:26:57.553 --> 03:27:04.359]  Well, the balance sheet, the real wealth of the nation is very rarely paid attention to unless somebody is trying to steal it.
[03:27:05.203 --> 03:27:26.031]  Or manipulate it and what I really like about this presence identifying the balance sheet issues a little bit and thinking about the cash flow statement looking at the bigger picture saying what can we do and you know here in Alaska the infrastructure to link it and I've talked about some of the political obstacles one of them is the Jones Act and I know
[03:27:26.733 --> 03:27:36.799]  Bringing the Jones Act up, I anger a whole bunch of people and special interest groups who are vested in the Jones Act, which protects shipbuilding in America.
[03:27:36.799 --> 03:27:37.660]  And I get that.
[03:27:37.660 --> 03:27:41.982]  We want a shipbuilding industry in America for the military and all of those good reasons.
[03:27:41.982 --> 03:27:46.865]  But it's become really a hindrance at this moment.
[03:27:47.483 --> 03:27:51.965]  Because what it does is it restricts our ability to ship, unless it's a U.S.
[03:27:51.965 --> 03:27:54.006]  flagship, from a U.S.
[03:27:54.006 --> 03:27:55.547]  port to a U.S.
[03:27:55.547 --> 03:27:55.887]  port.
[03:27:55.887 --> 03:27:57.527]  We have to ship on a U.S.
[03:27:57.527 --> 03:27:58.068]  flagship.
[03:27:58.068 --> 03:28:02.790]  So from Alaska to the rest of the country, it always has to be U.S.
[03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:03.250]  flagged.
[03:28:03.250 --> 03:28:12.414]  And the obstacle there is it means that all of our foreign competition gets to use foreign flag vessels that cost a tenth.
[03:28:13.420 --> 03:28:16.142]  10% of what it costs to build a ship in the U.S.
[03:28:16.142 --> 03:28:23.786]  So their shipping costs, literally, and because of the way they crew them and everything else and the regulations, are a 10.
[03:28:23.786 --> 03:28:30.870]  So for 10% of the freight charges, you can ship to Asia versus 10 times that charge for me to ship to Seattle.
[03:28:31.644 --> 03:28:33.246]  You know, we're going to talk more about all this.
[03:28:33.246 --> 03:28:37.490]  We're going to talk about the upside of what we're doing, as well, after the break.
[03:28:37.490 --> 03:28:38.271]  It's coming up.
[03:28:38.271 --> 03:28:41.814]  And I want people to remember, support the InfoWars store.
[03:28:41.814 --> 03:28:45.258]  That's how this vital information gets to the public.
[03:28:45.258 --> 03:28:46.579]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.

[03:28:59.217 --> 03:29:04.926]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain.
[03:29:04.926 --> 03:29:06.829]  But you don't want to take another pill.

[03:30:05.595 --> 03:30:14.283]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:30:14.283 --> 03:30:18.887]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:30:18.887 --> 03:30:20.349]  You are the info war.

[03:31:54.651 --> 03:32:02.058]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world's history.
[03:32:02.058 --> 03:32:06.342]  This is a digital, AI enforced, gag order.
[03:32:06.342 --> 03:32:10.045]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:32:15.714 --> 03:32:17.415]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:32:17.415 --> 03:32:18.636]  This is racketeering.
[03:32:18.636 --> 03:32:19.757]  This is cartels.
[03:32:19.757 --> 03:32:22.179]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:32:22.179 --> 03:32:24.041]  We need it now.
[03:32:24.041 --> 03:32:25.742]  You can take on Big Ten.
[03:32:25.742 --> 03:32:34.690]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:32:34.690 --> 03:32:42.737]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:32:42.737 --> 03:32:43.598]  The way to fight back
[03:32:44.138 --> 03:32:49.063]  Let's just support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[03:32:49.063 --> 03:32:57.291]  Understand that if they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:32:57.291 --> 03:33:00.514]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.992 --> 03:33:20.648]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich!
[03:33:25.422 --> 03:33:30.184]  And welcome back to InfoWars, and this is Dr. Nick Pegich.
[03:33:30.184 --> 03:33:36.366]  And you know, the images now that are up and are playing in the background are things from my life here in Alaska.
[03:33:36.366 --> 03:33:51.952]  So those that are watching get to see a good cross-section of Alaska, and starting out this segment, some sections of me from, man, 20, 25 years ago, even, film that I was doing quite a long time ago.
[03:33:52.772 --> 03:34:00.895]  Anyway, back to this Jones Act that I want to talk about, how this screws America, because it really does, it screws all of us.
[03:34:00.895 --> 03:34:22.022]  And I understand shipbuilding, but we need to make an exemption for Alaska at least, you know, because we have to have an opportunity to get our resources into the markets where value can be added by the industrial trades, by other American workers where value can be added, because right now the only incentive is to export.
[03:34:22.657 --> 03:34:24.638]  So here we're producing raw goods.
[03:34:24.638 --> 03:34:28.881]  We're not adding any value because Alaska is too small of a population.
[03:34:28.881 --> 03:34:30.603]  We don't have a manufacturing base.
[03:34:30.603 --> 03:34:46.734]  But I would say this to those out there is we have reasonably cost energy and unlimited supplies in terms of gas, oil, coal, coal to liquids potential, geothermal, hydroelectric.
[03:34:46.734 --> 03:34:49.236]  25% of Alaska's electricity is hydroelectric.
[03:34:49.236 --> 03:34:52.078]  Almost all of it in Southeast Alaska is hydroelectric.
[03:34:52.438 --> 03:35:04.382]  This is like virtually, you know, fixed cost, almost free once you build the capital expense, especially small scale, which is what a lot of ours is small developments of hydroelectric scattered about.
[03:35:04.382 --> 03:35:12.505]  And, you know, when you think about that as an input, it's about energy and then it's about transportation, information, communications.
[03:35:12.505 --> 03:35:15.766]  We don't have the basic transportation system, for goodness sake.
[03:35:15.766 --> 03:35:16.746]  And the Jones Act,
[03:35:17.441 --> 03:35:18.361]  So it restricts us.
[03:35:18.361 --> 03:35:21.182]  So here's the example I want to use, and I've used it before.
[03:35:21.182 --> 03:35:26.084]  You ship a container from China to Los Angeles, it's about a thousand bucks.
[03:35:26.084 --> 03:35:30.866]  You ship it halfway back from Los Angeles to Hawaii, because now you're on the U.S.
[03:35:30.866 --> 03:35:36.808]  flag vessel, it's 8,000 bucks to 10,000 bucks for the same container.
[03:35:36.808 --> 03:35:39.529]  Ten times, eight to ten times as much.
[03:35:39.529 --> 03:35:42.550]  So if you're shipping raw minerals out of Alaska,
[03:35:43.504 --> 03:35:51.346]  To somewhere where they can hook up with the trains, which is the closest place is going to be Canada or Japan, actually.
[03:35:51.346 --> 03:36:05.110]  And when you think about moving those resources into the West Coast of the United States and seeing again an industry build along the West Coast, an interior where rail can take minerals for processing.
[03:36:05.590 --> 03:36:06.932]  And we don't have that industry.
[03:36:06.932 --> 03:36:09.174]  A lot of that shutdown is gone.
[03:36:09.174 --> 03:36:10.616]  But can it revitalize?
[03:36:10.616 --> 03:36:11.817]  Yes, it can.
[03:36:11.817 --> 03:36:22.568]  Where the population centers are, because a lot of these facilities, the modern ones, are very labor efficient once they're constructed, because a lot of it is mechanical.
[03:36:22.648 --> 03:36:23.089]  I think so.
[03:36:39.325 --> 03:36:44.169]  Energy production, raw materials production, skilled labor.
[03:36:44.169 --> 03:36:51.255]  These are the factors of economic production that I've talked about so often during this program over the last couple of years.
[03:36:51.255 --> 03:36:58.841]  And when you start adding these things together and combining with the entrepreneurship and creativity of Americans, we've got something.
[03:36:58.841 --> 03:37:02.624]  This is a frontier region, you know, Alaska.
[03:37:02.624 --> 03:37:03.645]  It is 18% of the landmass of the
[03:37:05.026 --> 03:37:05.566]  We're good to go.
[03:37:32.851 --> 03:37:44.314]  Snow machines over ice roads in the winter, down rivers and river systems that freeze over that we plow and maintain by the various villages along these rivers.
[03:37:44.314 --> 03:37:46.615]  And that's our road system, for goodness sake.
[03:37:46.615 --> 03:37:48.936]  And this isn't 1880.
[03:37:48.936 --> 03:37:50.556]  This is 2019.
[03:37:50.556 --> 03:37:57.078]  You know, my family has three generations of public service here.
[03:37:58.387 --> 03:38:16.159]  Two, at the federal level, you know, and I think about this in terms of what's going on in the world and the country always screaming how horrible it is, how terrible it is, you know, and I hear that so much from the whiny left.
[03:38:16.159 --> 03:38:19.561]  This is a nation of opportunity.
[03:38:19.561 --> 03:38:20.702]  If we would wake up
[03:38:21.753 --> 03:38:25.974]  And recognize the balance sheet and sort of the bigger picture.
[03:38:25.974 --> 03:38:33.875]  And what's happened is those who recognize it has dumbed down the population enough to forget about it and divert the attention to other dialogue.
[03:38:33.875 --> 03:38:35.655]  That's why these networks are so important.
[03:38:35.655 --> 03:38:42.257]  You know, you think about free speech and what the last segments of Alex has ended on was all about that.
[03:38:42.257 --> 03:38:47.798]  The fundamental values that give us these opportunities even have this discussion.
[03:38:47.798 --> 03:38:50.118]  Because if we don't have this discussion,
[03:38:51.241 --> 03:38:57.928]  Then the hijacking of the National Treasury continues in lots of different ways.
[03:38:57.928 --> 03:38:58.829]  You know, think about it.
[03:38:58.829 --> 03:39:04.175]  It's like the trillions and trillions of dollars, like the big bank robbery.
[03:39:04.175 --> 03:39:10.983]  It's not the 7-Eleven, ladies and gentlemen, being stuck up on the corner that they'll fill up the column inches about.
[03:39:12.245 --> 03:39:12.485]  You know,
[03:39:27.395 --> 03:39:31.156]  You know, sort of what came before and how it adds up to where we are today.
[03:39:31.156 --> 03:39:41.439]  And you never have enough time to tell that story, you know, so we break it into these bite-sized bits to kick out to generate the kind of discussion that ought to be happening.
[03:39:41.439 --> 03:39:46.401]  And you know, when I think about each of these things represent the illusion
[03:39:48.167 --> 03:40:06.335]  Um, the fact that the cultural matrix has been created around us through media and now the, and then it was the liberation of media by giving us this thing called the internet, which in fact became the biggest control mechanism ever created by man.
[03:40:06.335 --> 03:40:07.295]  The opposite.
[03:40:08.368 --> 03:40:16.914]  Because of the current state of affairs, and that's why the litigation that Infowars is carrying forward and others are carrying forward needs to continue.
[03:40:16.914 --> 03:40:33.166]  If it doesn't, we are all lost, you know, because this globalist thing with the internet wrapped around it and the next version of that, which I can get into maybe in the next segment, which is the mind affects manipulation of it.
[03:40:33.166 --> 03:40:37.269]  First, in the simplest way, the cultural context, why not just go there?
[03:40:37.978 --> 03:40:38.979]  Let's just go there.
[03:40:38.979 --> 03:40:46.302]  You know, because look at everything we're talking about that's relevant today and that you've heard for the last several hours.
[03:40:46.302 --> 03:40:50.164]  If you've been listening, you're going to hear when Owen comes on in the next hour.
[03:40:50.164 --> 03:40:57.928]  All of these things, you would be denied if the powers that be would have their way.
[03:40:57.928 --> 03:40:58.368]  And is this
[03:41:01.283 --> 03:41:02.685]  What are founding fathers?
[03:41:02.685 --> 03:41:07.270]  I don't care whether you're liberal left or conservative right.
[03:41:07.270 --> 03:41:12.956]  Is this what blood has been shed for for 250 years on this continent and others?
[03:41:12.956 --> 03:41:14.338]  I don't think so.
[03:41:14.338 --> 03:41:15.159]  It's the voice.
[03:41:17.382 --> 03:41:19.805]  The cry of conspiracy, you know.
[03:41:19.805 --> 03:41:21.126]  Sometimes, you know what?
[03:41:21.126 --> 03:41:28.977]  They turn out to be true and we should not wait for historians in a world where we can discern and we can sort out.
[03:41:28.977 --> 03:41:32.361]  What we should be saying is, no, don't restrict what's heard.
[03:41:32.361 --> 03:41:33.002]  But certainly,
[03:41:34.235 --> 03:41:38.721]  Teach people how to critically analyze what they're thinking, but don't screen it out.
[03:41:38.721 --> 03:41:39.622]  No way, man.
[03:41:39.622 --> 03:41:40.924]  Slippery slope.
[03:41:40.924 --> 03:41:43.107]  This network is about protecting that.
[03:41:43.107 --> 03:41:47.933]  I think it's incumbent on all of us to invest in that, the InfoWard.
[03:41:49.475 --> 03:41:52.077]  And I think we're going to see some really great outcomes.
[03:41:52.077 --> 03:41:52.978]  I believe that.
[03:41:52.978 --> 03:41:54.539]  I sincerely do.
[03:41:54.539 --> 03:41:56.861]  And let's talk about that illusion.
[03:41:56.861 --> 03:42:07.089]  Starting with the easiest way to keep people from affective effort is keep you in a state of anxiety and fear and agitation.
[03:42:07.089 --> 03:42:16.516]  And look at the left, how easy they succumb to it and how angry, how really, really angry everyone is and how out of control that anger takes them.
[03:42:16.516 --> 03:42:17.397]  This is not
[03:42:19.098 --> 03:42:29.112]  What we were destined to do as living souls, as created human beings in the image and likeness of God, for goodness sake.
[03:42:29.973 --> 03:42:31.674]  Um, reframe it.
[03:42:31.674 --> 03:42:32.654]  We got an opportunity.
[03:42:32.654 --> 03:42:34.554]  You know, we're going into the break.
[03:42:34.554 --> 03:42:43.797]  Uh, I want to come back up on the next hour talking about cracking the illusion and the delusion, breaking that zombie trance, because that's what's going on.
[03:42:43.797 --> 03:42:45.237]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:42:45.237 --> 03:42:49.899]  We're breaking the zombie trance with the InfoWars right here.

[03:44:05.067 --> 03:44:13.315]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with, and that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[03:44:13.315 --> 03:44:17.558]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[03:44:18.399 --> 03:44:24.025]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.

[03:44:54.341 --> 03:44:57.345]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[03:44:57.345 --> 03:44:59.928]  That what God gave us from Mother Nature is incredible.
[03:44:59.928 --> 03:45:02.711]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[03:45:02.711 --> 03:45:04.714]  And the globalists are so upset.
[03:45:04.714 --> 03:45:07.537]  The problem is, people forget to take them.
[03:45:08.789 --> 03:45:13.851]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[03:45:13.851 --> 03:45:14.811]  So we looked at that.
[03:45:14.811 --> 03:45:16.432]  We made the very best a.m.

[03:46:00.196 --> 03:46:04.638]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border, talks about MS-13 and more.
[03:46:04.638 --> 03:46:05.559]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[03:46:05.559 --> 03:46:06.019]  Yes, sir.
[03:46:06.019 --> 03:46:07.340]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:46:07.340 --> 03:46:09.421]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[03:46:09.421 --> 03:46:15.364]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sport, the shirts, all the equipment.
[03:46:15.364 --> 03:46:17.305]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[03:46:17.305 --> 03:46:18.266]  God bless you, brother.
[03:46:18.266 --> 03:46:25.130]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody, just to help spread that word.
[03:46:25.350 --> 03:46:26.371]  You're our only hope, brother.
[03:46:26.371 --> 03:46:28.692]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[03:46:28.692 --> 03:46:31.433]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[03:46:57.293 --> 03:47:14.487]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.487 --> 03:47:16.609]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:16.609 --> 03:47:18.551]  Because there is a war on.
[03:47:18.551 --> 03:47:20.172]  For your mind.
[03:47:20.172 --> 03:47:22.074]  With Nick Begich.
[03:47:26.175 --> 03:47:29.217]  And welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:47:29.217 --> 03:47:39.124]  Those that are watching, you've seen some images of me out on one of my remote properties and some of the travel around Alaska, different points in the last few years.
[03:47:39.124 --> 03:47:39.465]  You know,
[03:47:40.959 --> 03:47:56.467]  Man picking it up where we left off you know it always is a combination with me you see with the information that's relevant I mean in terms of how we sort of view the world and sort of the facts around it and my interpretation of some of that and then also the value system that allows us maybe to kind of
[03:47:57.555 --> 03:48:10.592]  Pierce the veil of it, if you will, of looking at the world from the perspective of, all right, you know, if we're truly stewards, caretakers, you know, I mean, think about it as a stewardship question.
[03:48:10.592 --> 03:48:15.358]  How do we look at what's here and
[03:48:16.879 --> 03:48:30.886]  Are lifted by it, if you will, you know, where serves us in some way, and we serve it in a protective and sensible way, you know, where I mean, you look at the scene behind me, this property is going to be developed for both mining and tourism.
[03:48:30.886 --> 03:48:32.506]  You know, isn't that interesting?
[03:48:32.506 --> 03:48:36.068]  And it's like a half a mile to 600 feet, depending on where you sit on it.
[03:48:36.768 --> 03:48:42.456]  Uh, from a wilderness area that'll never be developed and never see a road, nothing, you know, it'll be nothing.
[03:48:42.456 --> 03:48:45.079]  Uh, that's like several million acres.
[03:48:45.079 --> 03:48:46.802]  And, you know, when you think about
[03:48:49.461 --> 03:48:50.282]  Alaska.
[03:48:50.282 --> 03:48:55.968]  You know, we have 104 million acres of national parks and preserves there already.
[03:48:55.968 --> 03:48:56.869]  That's pretty big.
[03:48:56.869 --> 03:48:57.990]  You know, that's like unreal.
[03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:59.271]  Most of them you can't get to.
[03:48:59.271 --> 03:49:04.296]  And unless you're really rich, you'll never see them because they're so expensive to get to.
[03:49:04.296 --> 03:49:07.740]  But they preserve part of our planet.
[03:49:07.740 --> 03:49:08.641]  That's kind of cool.
[03:49:08.641 --> 03:49:10.403]  You know, and I see that.
[03:49:10.843 --> 03:49:19.170]  And the balancing act between those regions and the regions that can be developed for oil, gas and minerals often overlap.
[03:49:19.170 --> 03:49:29.579]  And the ability to develop strategies that work as stewards both of the land and people that benefit from the land.
[03:49:29.579 --> 03:49:31.020]  And that's us, you know.
[03:49:31.020 --> 03:49:36.004]  And Alaska has the most stringent environmental regulations anywhere in the United States.
[03:49:43.283 --> 03:49:53.285]  Really do what should be happening here, and there's a lot of reasons for that, and I'm never going to have enough time to give you all of them, you know, but you can go back again historically and look at what's happened.
[03:49:53.285 --> 03:50:08.089]  And Alaska's always been about resource extraction, you know, go back to the Russians and they started up the Aleutian chain as they were working their way up that chain of islands 2,000 miles long, stretching almost to Japan and to Russia.
[03:50:09.992 --> 03:50:17.596]  They were doing the fur trade, you know, and they were then taking those furs and they were taking them to China where they got incredible wealth for them.
[03:50:17.596 --> 03:50:22.879]  And they had kind of this triangle going and they enslaved the Aleuts along that route.
[03:50:22.879 --> 03:50:28.702]  And then they brought in the Orthodox Church, which is sort of did this other cultural thing to them.
[03:50:28.702 --> 03:50:32.545]  And then we brought in the disease and disorder and all the chaos that went with it.
[03:50:32.545 --> 03:50:38.648]  But at the end of the day, they got into the Southeast Alaska, the Tlingits and the Haidas kicked them back.
[03:50:39.375 --> 03:50:40.136]  Threw them out.
[03:50:40.136 --> 03:50:41.256]  They couldn't go inland.
[03:50:41.256 --> 03:50:44.358]  The Athabascans never let them.
[03:50:44.358 --> 03:50:48.881]  The Tlingits and Haidas along the coast didn't let them either.
[03:50:48.881 --> 03:51:00.709]  And so eventually, and there was a point in time in the 1800s where the czar of Russia decided the way America was kind of rolling, they were probably going to take it anyway, might as well sell it.
[03:51:00.709 --> 03:51:02.410]  So we bought it.
[03:51:02.410 --> 03:51:03.330]  Two cents an acre.
[03:51:03.330 --> 03:51:05.952]  That was, as the theory goes, in the Treaty of Secession.
[03:51:08.111 --> 03:51:10.012]  1867, and the next thing began.
[03:51:10.012 --> 03:51:13.234]  It was kind of a Seward's Folly, a big joke in Washington.
[03:51:13.234 --> 03:51:18.557]  But what happened next was copper and gold and silver were discovered.
[03:51:18.557 --> 03:51:20.778]  And then the next rush was on.
[03:51:20.778 --> 03:51:27.922]  That expired only at World War II, where it was no longer priority industries.
[03:51:27.922 --> 03:51:29.163]  And so they shut them all down.
[03:51:29.163 --> 03:51:30.604]  That was kind of the end of it.
[03:51:31.324 --> 03:51:34.006]  After the war, everything had quadrupled in price.
[03:51:34.006 --> 03:51:39.550]  You couldn't restart mines with gold at a fixed price and everything else inflated 400%.
[03:51:39.550 --> 03:51:40.331]  So it never did.
[03:51:40.331 --> 03:51:41.591]  It just died.
[03:51:41.591 --> 03:51:42.712]  The place just died.
[03:51:42.712 --> 03:51:44.373]  They never built the infrastructure.
[03:51:44.373 --> 03:51:48.196]  All the railroads that were planned for Alaska never got built.
[03:51:48.196 --> 03:51:49.457]  And there was a whole network of them.
[03:51:50.120 --> 03:51:58.050]  They were going to start down in Cordova and continue into the interior from there, and they were going to go off of Anchorage into the interior.
[03:51:58.050 --> 03:51:59.231]  Some of that got built.
[03:51:59.231 --> 03:52:01.034]  Seward, Whittier, those got built.
[03:52:02.201 --> 03:52:20.352]  Going up to Fairbanks, but they never flank the southern bit of the Brooks Range, go out to McGrath and on into Nome and connect the regions of Alaska and these mineral belts, these huge, huge mineral belts and interdispersed by oil and gas basins.
[03:52:20.352 --> 03:52:25.095]  And that's the National Treasury, ladies and gentlemen, that is being lost in this
[03:52:26.349 --> 03:52:27.652]  Hold discussion.
[03:52:27.652 --> 03:52:38.031]  No one even talks about it, you know, and so here's the voice from the wilderness on the InfoWars telling you, ladies and gentlemen, that we have this opportunity.
[03:52:38.817 --> 03:52:46.400]  To make America great again by including Alaska in the equation in the average American thinking.
[03:52:46.400 --> 03:52:55.825]  We have only 750,000 people that live here in a region that takes up almost one-fifth of the whole land mass of the whole nation.
[03:52:55.825 --> 03:53:01.547]  Gee, I think population's a problem, but the problem is it's run in the wrong direction.
[03:53:01.547 --> 03:53:04.168]  You know, we don't have a population.
[03:53:04.168 --> 03:53:05.369]  We don't have an infrastructure.
[03:53:05.369 --> 03:53:07.530]  We don't have a connection to the rest of the nation.
[03:53:08.406 --> 03:53:13.851]  By road and a preemption by the Jones Act for the proper trade.
[03:53:13.851 --> 03:53:21.898]  You know, it takes four hours from Anchorage for me to fly to Seattle, the next closest major U.S.
[03:53:21.898 --> 03:53:23.179]  city.
[03:53:23.179 --> 03:53:28.143]  Four hours to fly there in a commercial airliner.
[03:53:28.143 --> 03:53:28.723]  All right?
[03:53:28.723 --> 03:53:31.746]  Now, think about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:53:32.666 --> 03:53:38.648]  Um, in perspective of the nation to get it to try and get that perspective a little bit.
[03:53:38.648 --> 03:53:49.252]  It's like going from Anchorage to Prudhoe Bay is like me going from Seattle to San Francisco, you know, or maybe somewhere midway down California's coast.
[03:53:49.252 --> 03:53:52.654]  But the point is, it's big and there's no roads.
[03:53:52.654 --> 03:53:56.475]  You have more roads in Seattle than my whole state where I live.
[03:53:56.475 --> 03:53:57.516]  And think about it.
[03:53:57.516 --> 03:54:01.157]  More roads in one major city, the closest major city than the whole state.
[03:54:02.478 --> 03:54:14.683]  That connects our national treasury or I should say doesn't connect our national treasury and you know when you when you start to think about the nation and the possibilities.
[03:54:15.393 --> 03:54:17.014]  I think two of the balance sheet.
[03:54:17.014 --> 03:54:20.476]  Okay, what can we do to include our infrastructure?
[03:54:20.476 --> 03:54:33.804]  So there's a there's a program there's something going on right now and it's happening with the discussion between a Canadian entrepreneur and there's some ports that were built and some rail links that are needed and some easements have been granted but
[03:54:34.324 --> 03:54:51.897]  There's a whole discussion now about extending the Canadian rail system into Alaska for the purpose of moving heavy oils out of Alaska by rail and out of Canada by rail, actually, to the coast, which, you know, kind of moving the freight the other direction.
[03:54:51.897 --> 03:54:55.040]  But the other thing it does is it shaves two days.
[03:54:55.901 --> 03:55:08.340]  Off of Asian transport, if you bring it first from Asia to Alaska, put it on rail and take to the East Coast and ship it, you shave two days off of Asian transport into Europe.
[03:55:08.340 --> 03:55:10.924]  So this route would open up
[03:55:11.972 --> 03:55:12.932]  Yeah, you're right.
[03:55:12.932 --> 03:55:18.674]  They're not going to get the freight for the ore going out because they made it so uneconomic they can't.
[03:55:34.720 --> 03:55:44.731]  But what they will get, whether they like it or not, is more railroad jobs, and more Teamster jobs, and more operating engineers jobs, and more every other craft job.
[03:55:44.731 --> 03:55:46.112]  And guess what?
[03:55:46.112 --> 03:55:52.419]  More freight coming into those ports to support all that growth, and more longshoremen jobs too.
[03:55:53.169 --> 03:55:56.411]  And this is a short-sightedness of people's self-interest.
[03:55:56.411 --> 03:55:58.672]  And this is what is called special interest.
[03:55:58.672 --> 03:56:00.093]  And I want to talk about that.
[03:56:00.093 --> 03:56:06.096]  Because special interest is what has corrupted and destroyed this country and continues to do so.
[03:56:06.096 --> 03:56:10.339]  And now it's being done with the technocracy that I've talked so often about.
[03:56:10.339 --> 03:56:15.402]  And again, weaving back into these underlying themes that are raping us.
[03:56:16.796 --> 03:56:39.191]  You know, I mean, we are the stewards with an opportunity to continue the progress of 250 years, and we are being jerked around by globalists telling us how poor we are, and how horrible it is, and oh gosh, the sky is gonna be falling, and it's untrue, it's a lie, and it's nonsense.
[03:56:39.191 --> 03:56:41.913]  And the thing is, people buy the story.
[03:56:41.913 --> 03:56:46.076]  And then the whole underlying emphasis of
[03:56:46.756 --> 03:56:49.338]  The drama we co-create shifts.
[03:56:49.338 --> 03:56:51.640]  And now it is the culture war.
[03:56:51.640 --> 03:57:00.126]  It is a war over ideology and thinking, but it should not be a war of tribalism that drives us apart.
[03:57:00.126 --> 03:57:03.809]  It should be a bigger war.
[03:57:03.809 --> 03:57:04.850]  A different war.
[03:57:04.850 --> 03:57:14.817]  A war that's fought internally as we recognize the divinity that we are as created human beings and begin to express that in our world as stewards.
[03:57:15.753 --> 03:57:21.819]  And as good brothers and sisters to one another, whether we like each other all the time or not.
[03:57:21.819 --> 03:57:25.083]  That's the hardest challenges in the 21st century.
[03:57:25.083 --> 03:57:30.008]  To be the divinity that we were created to be on earth and at least behave that way.
[03:57:30.008 --> 03:57:32.570]  We're going to be right back after these brief messages.
[03:57:32.570 --> 03:57:34.572]  Remember the info wars.
[03:57:34.572 --> 03:57:37.715]  We have something to say and all of us are the tip of the spear.
[03:57:37.715 --> 03:57:38.696]  Thank you for listening.
[03:57:38.696 --> 03:57:39.317]  We'll be right back.
[03:57:45.287 --> 03:57:46.330]  It's true.
[03:57:46.330 --> 03:57:47.514]  I stayed up late last night.
[03:58:41.826 --> 03:58:46.710]  And get the fish oil.
[03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:56.139]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
