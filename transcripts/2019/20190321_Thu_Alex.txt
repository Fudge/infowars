[00:00:07.692 --> 00:00:15.917]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:31.987]  Certainly for some, Alex Jones can be scary and abrasive.
[00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:33.648]  Never!
[00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:38.230]  Never defeat the human spirit!
[00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.510]  No!
[00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:51.077]  But if you can get through all that to explore what he's been saying, to see for yourself what it is that the establishment wants to hide from you, then the information you find could be life-changing.
[00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:53.674]  He predicted 9-11.
[00:00:53.674 --> 00:01:02.468]  And if there was an outside threat like a Bin Laden, who was a known CIS in the 80s, he's the boogeyman they need in this Orwellian phony system.
[00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:06.354]  He exposed the cremation of care ceremony at Bohemian Grove.
[00:01:13.244 --> 00:01:22.311]  He educated us about the relationship between the Third Reich and modern globalism.
[00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:30.396]  He helped reveal the so-called Bilderberg Group et al.
[00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:37.221]  He was the loudest voice reporting on the union between the Communist Chinese and Silicon Valley.
[00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:39.723]  They falsely edited him.
[00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.232]  They lie about his reporting of Sandy Hook.
[00:01:45.232 --> 00:01:52.316]  They lie that he pushed a child down in a viral video.
[00:01:52.316 --> 00:01:58.339]  And now he is being de-platformed by Facebook, Apple, and Google.
[00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:03.142]  Private companies are being harassed and encouraged to stop doing business with him.
[00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:05.263]  And then we get hit and say, you don't want to use our software.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.883]  YouTubers are being censored for talking about him.
[00:02:09.883 --> 00:02:11.485]  We just got taken down by YouTube.
[00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:13.547]  They just killed our stream.
[00:02:13.547 --> 00:02:14.007]  Really?
[00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:14.368]  Yep.
[00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:18.652]  And some Americans are actually celebrating this.
[00:02:18.652 --> 00:02:19.813]  This is America in 2018.
[00:02:19.813 --> 00:02:28.201]  Will you sit by and allow liberty and freedom to be taken away right before your eyes?
[00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:32.569]  Will you do nothing?
[00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.354]  While history is being recorded, will you sit and do nothing?
[00:02:37.354 --> 00:02:45.322]  Or will you do your own research, discover the truth, and stand for freedom?
[00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:50.266]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:23.009]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:27.718]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:38.626]  We are now three hours and three minutes into the global 50-hour emergency transmission.
[00:03:38.626 --> 00:03:42.448]  David Knight just finished up doing a great job like he does every weekday morning.
[00:03:42.448 --> 00:03:46.011]  So glad he got better from that heart attack and his back stronger than ever.
[00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:48.252]  That happens a lot when you've got major blockages and don't know it.
[00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:49.493]  Tough cookie.
[00:03:49.493 --> 00:03:51.814]  Back in the saddle, more powerful.
[00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:53.435]  Powerful Jedi.
[00:03:53.435 --> 00:03:55.977]  More powerful than ever in the fight for liberty.
[00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:56.838]  And then of course I'm here.
[00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:08.371]  Then you've got Owen Schroer and a bunch of special guest hosts, a bunch of big surprises, a huge raft of individuals as we make it the focal point.
[00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:10.372]  Stop the bias.
[00:04:10.372 --> 00:04:11.613]  Stop the censorship.
[00:04:11.613 --> 00:04:13.553]  Stop the election meddling.
[00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:14.694]  Stop the racketeering.
[00:04:16.954 --> 00:04:20.536]  Stop the big multinational cartels working together to censor.
[00:04:20.536 --> 00:04:22.417]  It's only getting worse.
[00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:30.062]  As they move against the Second Amendment, they're moving against the First Amendment because they can't beat us politically and culturally and spiritually and economically.
[00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:32.792]  So it's all coming up.
[00:04:32.792 --> 00:04:33.653]  Huge broadcast.
[00:04:33.653 --> 00:04:35.674]  We'll tell you all about it when we come back in 60 seconds.
[00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:46.238]  But whatever you do, please go to newswars.com and infowars.com and take the live page we've put up for the 50-hour broadcast and send it out to everybody you know.
[00:04:46.238 --> 00:04:46.978]  Save the First Amendment.
[00:04:46.978 --> 00:04:48.479]  Stop big tech censorship.
[00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.999]  50-hour emergency broadcast.
[00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:54.221]  The page is now live on the front page of infowars.com and newswars.com.
[00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.542]  Only you can get past the censors.
[00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:58.282]  Only you can defeat the globalists.
[00:04:58.282 --> 00:04:59.483]  You are the resistance.
[00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.023]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[00:05:05.023 --> 00:05:09.267]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:17.214]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[00:05:17.214 --> 00:05:20.316]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:23.799]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.262]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[00:05:28.262 --> 00:05:30.303]  We are the power structure.
[00:05:30.303 --> 00:05:31.924]  We are the inventors.
[00:05:31.924 --> 00:05:33.685]  We are the trailblazers.
[00:05:33.685 --> 00:05:37.087]  And the globalists understand that.
[00:05:37.087 --> 00:05:44.211]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[00:05:44.211 --> 00:05:47.993]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:58.171]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping and 50% off at importastore.com.
[00:05:58.171 --> 00:05:59.534]  Something everybody should take advantage of.
[00:06:17.145 --> 00:06:18.987]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:18.987 --> 00:06:22.450]  Because there is a war on, on your mind.
[00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.552]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, March 21st, 2019.
[00:06:37.717 --> 00:06:43.804]  And we have kicked off the 50-hour broadcast that's running until 10 a.m.
[00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:44.324]  Saturday.
[00:06:44.324 --> 00:06:46.246]  I want to thank you all for joining us.
[00:06:46.246 --> 00:06:48.389]  I want to thank the crew for the great job they're doing.
[00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:56.392]  We are posting a list, but more is being added all the time to Infowars.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.com.
[00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:23.674]  And really document the censorship and control that we've seen, but also develop plans to counteract it, including demonstrations at big tech headquarters.
[00:07:23.674 --> 00:07:26.014]  Not just going to Congress when they have committee hearings.
[00:07:26.014 --> 00:07:28.035]  I intend to continue doing that as well.
[00:07:28.035 --> 00:07:31.236]  But taking action.
[00:07:31.236 --> 00:07:34.937]  And pushing Congress to take action.
[00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:39.218]  And getting legislation written, which I've done, and delivered to the President.
[00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:42.172]  Oh, there's a reason they want us off air.
[00:07:42.172 --> 00:07:49.915]  So we're going to let everybody in on the next phase of the information war here.
[00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:55.058]  Because again, if we don't have the First Amendment, they're going to get the Second Amendment and everything else.
[00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:59.840]  And you notice in Australia and New Zealand, they're passing draconian gun control laws, even though
[00:08:00.762 --> 00:08:04.885]  You have to jump through all these hoops, get special licenses to get semi-automatic.
[00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:06.266]  This guy had his illegally.
[00:08:06.266 --> 00:08:07.627]  He wasn't even in the country.
[00:08:07.627 --> 00:08:10.609]  You know, with the proper visa, it's coming out.
[00:08:10.609 --> 00:08:13.171]  How was he able to do it?
[00:08:13.171 --> 00:08:16.574]  But no one discusses that.
[00:08:16.574 --> 00:08:20.997]  No, they just say, oh, we're gonna take all the guns now.
[00:08:20.997 --> 00:08:25.501]  Oh, and DrudgeReport.com linked to a Zero Hedge article that we posted yesterday.
[00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:28.463]  And I changed the Zero Hedge headline
[00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:35.083]  Basically dealing with the fact that the final level of censorship is here, the banning of URLs.
[00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:40.466]  Well Drudge properly changed my headline and said the next level is here.
[00:08:40.466 --> 00:08:56.094]  And I got to thinking, well yeah, they'll start actually banning IP addresses next and then they'll just physically arrest you like they're already doing in many areas of Europe if you criticize radical Islam or your children being groomed and sexualized by the LGBT community.
[00:08:56.094 --> 00:08:56.915]  So Drudge is right.
[00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:03.437]  So I had the headline changed on that viral article that's from ZeroHedge.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:09:03.437 --> 00:09:09.284]  I had it changed to, the next level is here.
[00:09:09.284 --> 00:09:10.706]  That's right.
[00:09:10.706 --> 00:09:12.888]  Because I started thinking, wait, I just changed the headline.
[00:09:12.888 --> 00:09:13.729]  It's next level.
[00:09:13.729 --> 00:09:15.391]  It's not final level.
[00:09:15.391 --> 00:09:16.913]  There's a whole bunch more levels to this.
[00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:25.219]  So there you go, and that adds to all these new articles that are on InfoWars.com that update you on the latest developments.
[00:09:25.219 --> 00:09:38.049]  They're not just banning Zero Hedge, the big telecoms, all three of them working in tandem in a concerted synchronicity, in a synchronized attack pattern, but now they're banning a whole bunch of others.
[00:09:38.049 --> 00:09:45.434]  Australian ISPs ban LiveLeak, but not Facebook and Twitter over shooting video.
[00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:47.456]  Even though LiveLeak took it down as well,
[00:09:48.604 --> 00:09:51.606]  In fact, it wasn't even the place it was premiered.
[00:09:51.606 --> 00:09:56.229]  But oh, you see, live leaks, not part of the big tech monopoly.
[00:09:56.229 --> 00:10:08.858]  Just like Andrew Torba and Gab got blamed because the monster that went into the synagogue last year and killed a bunch of people said four minutes before, I'm going in.
[00:10:08.858 --> 00:10:09.979]  Wow!
[00:10:09.979 --> 00:10:13.621]  So on a message board, he's going in.
[00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:15.823]  It's his fault.
[00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:17.644]  Not Gab.
[00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.385]  It's the killer's fault.
[00:10:21.385 --> 00:10:24.686]  Gab... You're about to have a message board.
[00:10:24.686 --> 00:10:25.426]  It's like a telephone.
[00:10:25.426 --> 00:10:29.888]  It's like if I called somebody and said, I'm going to go in and kill some people, hypothetically.
[00:10:29.888 --> 00:10:35.030]  Is AT&T or Apple phone or Droid, are they to blame?
[00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:41.082]  I mean, this is just incredible how you can see the subverter film of Kennedy getting killed.
[00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:45.963]  You can watch all the PBS documentaries of the Jews being marched into pits and shot in the back of the head.
[00:10:45.963 --> 00:10:47.163]  It's horrible.
[00:10:47.163 --> 00:10:52.624]  But it's on TV for a reason because viewer discretion advised, but this is what goes on.
[00:10:52.624 --> 00:10:54.025]  Now, am I saying put it everywhere?
[00:10:54.025 --> 00:10:57.645]  No, we've made the decision not to post it on our servers.
[00:10:57.645 --> 00:10:59.686]  We showed blurred footage.
[00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:04.571]  Of him going in and didn't show the people being killed.
[00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:08.213]  CNN and others did the first few days show that, was it blurred.
[00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:11.915]  But they're okay, you see.
[00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:17.158]  Now, several YouTube channels that aren't ours, but were posting our material, were banned.
[00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:28.725]  And they said, because Jones said no one died, and Jones said that people should be able to air the video, and he aired it.
[00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:29.325]  And that's not true.
[00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:36.839]  We did show still shots and short clips of the gun and the writing on it and his manifesto, just like the media did.
[00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:45.903]  But see, we're the bad people in this new class structure where corporate media is above the law, they do whatever they want.
[00:11:45.903 --> 00:11:46.583]  Here's an example.
[00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:53.991]  As a gimmick, almost everyone you see now on CNN, MSNBC says the S word.
[00:11:53.991 --> 00:11:55.572]  Constantly.
[00:11:55.572 --> 00:12:02.013]  And they never have an FCC issue, even though they are on a lot of broadcast stations.
[00:12:02.013 --> 00:12:03.134]  Not just cable.
[00:12:03.134 --> 00:12:05.194]  No one would even think, whoa, FCC!
[00:12:05.194 --> 00:12:06.195]  That's CNN!
[00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:07.575]  I mean, they're allowed
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:11.361]  To say Trump's full of you-know-what.
[00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:13.903]  And I don't want to use cuss words here.
[00:12:13.903 --> 00:12:16.124]  The point is I'm on AM and FM radio.
[00:12:16.124 --> 00:12:18.846]  I'm on UHF, VHF TV and cable stations.
[00:12:18.846 --> 00:12:20.306]  And we don't do that.
[00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:28.651]  But every once in a while, once a year, if somebody slips through on the delay and we don't catch a cuss word, stations call up and get mad at us.
[00:12:28.651 --> 00:12:29.852]  That's fine.
[00:12:29.852 --> 00:12:32.594]  But CNN is saying it every day.
[00:12:33.928 --> 00:12:36.170]  All these cuss words, but oh, they're God!
[00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.934]  And broadcast TV shows have cuss words on them.
[00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:45.636]  And the FCC does nothing.
[00:12:45.636 --> 00:12:48.798]  Nothing.
[00:12:48.798 --> 00:12:51.900]  Like you see NFL games and people are cussing everywhere.
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:13:01.127]  All I'm saying is, where's this idea that if you're conservative, if you're a nationalist, if you're a Christian, if you're a libertarian, if you believe in free market capitalism, and then
[00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:19.887]  You simply show videos that are being shot in public schools of small children having semi-naked men spread their legs in front of children's faces and stations complain.
[00:13:19.887 --> 00:13:24.529]  And I understand it's obscene, but it's being shown to children.
[00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:25.950]  See how that works?
[00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:31.072]  How are we supposed to stop it if we don't show audiences?
[00:13:31.072 --> 00:13:32.092]  In fact, here's the latest one.
[00:13:33.493 --> 00:13:46.086]  This is being glorified by Facebook and now this video of a man as a drag queen getting on a table like a topless dancer and spreading his legs in front of the kids.
[00:13:46.086 --> 00:13:49.570]  It's all sexual grooming.
[00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.292]  I'm telling the kids, shake your booty!
[00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:54.680]  Shake your booty!
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.601]  And the woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs.
[00:13:56.601 --> 00:13:58.122]  It's a man.
[00:13:58.122 --> 00:14:00.483]  This is adult entertainment.
[00:14:00.483 --> 00:14:01.583]  But what do predators do?
[00:14:01.583 --> 00:14:03.104]  They target children.
[00:14:03.104 --> 00:14:09.047]  And it's all a coming out, not just here, but in Europe, targeting children.
[00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:13.989]  And that's not even the super obscene stuff that, I mean, should we show it all?
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:21.464]  I mean, yeah, there's a 400-pound black guy, dressed in a dress, shaking his butt in kids' faces, saying, shake your booty.
[00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:25.807]  You know what the station's complained about, and they're right, but it's what small children are shown.
[00:14:25.807 --> 00:14:26.987]  We're not going to show it.
[00:14:26.987 --> 00:14:35.273]  What they do is they now have the men show up at these events, city-sponsored here in Austin, with glitter on their genitals.
[00:14:35.273 --> 00:14:37.714]  No clothes.
[00:14:37.714 --> 00:14:40.376]  Glitter on their genitals.
[00:14:40.376 --> 00:14:41.517]  Glitter on their genitals.
[00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:44.409]  And that's it.
[00:14:44.409 --> 00:14:49.513]  And they go, oh, I'm wearing something, and the little kids pose with full-grown men who are naked.
[00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:55.718]  And I shouldn't show it to you at 11.14 Central Time on TV stations.
[00:14:55.718 --> 00:14:56.698]  I agree.
[00:14:56.698 --> 00:14:59.660]  It's not suitable for television.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.881]  I cannot show you this.
[00:15:00.881 --> 00:15:05.985]  I've shown it on air, and that station's complaint.
[00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:09.888]  And we go to these events, and these are things that adults are shaken by.
[00:15:13.072 --> 00:15:24.380]  And we cannot show you, but children are shown it.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.041]  And obviously somebody in the control room thinks we people should see it.
[00:15:27.041 --> 00:15:30.564]  No, we're not going to show it.
[00:15:30.564 --> 00:15:34.346]  These are our children we're talking about.
[00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:35.667]  But I'm digressing.
[00:15:35.667 --> 00:15:39.510]  When we come back, we come back.
[00:15:41.895 --> 00:15:47.558]  There is so much to cover, so much to break down, on so many fronts, I don't even know where to start.
[00:15:47.558 --> 00:15:55.021]  With the geopolitical developments, the economy developments, Mueller's report set to come out, so much more.
[00:15:55.021 --> 00:15:59.344]  This is one broadcast you're not going to want to miss, and it's going for 50 hours.
[00:15:59.344 --> 00:16:02.945]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse.

[00:17:29.155 --> 00:17:35.376]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:35.376 --> 00:17:38.397]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:38.397 --> 00:17:44.338]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:44.338 --> 00:17:48.118]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:48.118 --> 00:17:49.378]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:49.378 --> 00:17:50.739]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.739 --> 00:17:56.920]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.360]  Available at Amazon Books.

[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:11.689]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:11.689 --> 00:20:15.533]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:15.533 --> 00:20:17.255]  America!
[00:20:17.255 --> 00:20:18.736]  Es wunderbar!
[00:20:18.736 --> 00:20:22.440]  We're all living in America!
[00:20:30.126 --> 00:20:31.147]  You found it.
[00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:37.436]  The undisputed, number one, alternative, pro-America, pro-liberty broadcast in the world.
[00:20:39.324 --> 00:20:44.849]  And hell, some weeks we've been the number one show in the world, number one podcast, number one broadcast, period.
[00:20:44.849 --> 00:20:50.634]  That's why the enemy is trying to censor us and suppress us, because they know that freedom is popular.
[00:20:50.634 --> 00:20:52.916]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:52.916 --> 00:20:59.021]  By the way, if you're a TV viewer, you're like, why does he always say, I'm Alex Jones, coming in to a break?
[00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:00.923]  Radio stations want that.
[00:21:00.923 --> 00:21:01.704]  They need that.
[00:21:01.704 --> 00:21:04.486]  That's how people fill out the ratings.
[00:21:05.387 --> 00:21:08.608]  That's how that's basically determined for radio.
[00:21:08.608 --> 00:21:10.468]  That's why I'm always telling you I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:10.468 --> 00:21:14.129]  It's not an egomaniac thing we're doing.
[00:21:14.129 --> 00:21:17.450]  It is required for talk radio, period.
[00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:20.651]  Rule number one, identify the program.
[00:21:20.651 --> 00:21:23.992]  Rule number one for local stations, identify their call letters.
[00:21:23.992 --> 00:21:26.152]  And their number.
[00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:33.394]  And if they're talk radio, or they're rock and roll, or they're Christian, or they're Spanish, whatever it is.
[00:21:33.394 --> 00:21:34.234]  Just throwing that out there.
[00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:38.089]  I saw some comment on YouTube, it's funny.
[00:21:38.089 --> 00:21:40.870]  Jones is always saying, I'm Alex Jones, I'm Alex Jones, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:43.011]  Yes, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:21:43.011 --> 00:21:45.531]  And quite frankly, I'm proud of what we've done together.
[00:21:45.531 --> 00:21:48.452]  You, the audience, are the info war.
[00:21:48.452 --> 00:21:49.312]  I'm not just saying that.
[00:21:49.312 --> 00:21:55.274]  All right, let me shift gears back into what I think is pretty much the top story right now.
[00:21:55.274 --> 00:22:00.775]  And that's the gun control and the attack on free speech expanding out of the epicenter in New Zealand.
[00:22:00.775 --> 00:22:03.136]  We're not even a week after the tragic event.
[00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:03.836]  We're right at a week.
[00:22:07.085 --> 00:22:18.476]  I've had scores of newspapers call, you've seen them intensify censorship against us, saying Alex Jones says nobody died.
[00:22:18.476 --> 00:22:19.437]  Well, I didn't say that.
[00:22:19.437 --> 00:22:23.481]  But if I wanted to say that, that's my right.
[00:22:23.481 --> 00:22:26.004]  And if people don't want to tune into it, the show would go away.
[00:22:26.004 --> 00:22:26.745]  But I didn't say that.
[00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.491]  Anrush Limbaugh came out and said what I said.
[00:22:31.491 --> 00:22:39.913]  The manifesto says he's an eco-fascist that wants to depopulate the world, he wants to reduce world population, he's trying to get blacks and whites and others to kill each other.
[00:22:39.913 --> 00:22:48.556]  That's a classic divide-and-conquer Charlie Manson style helter-skelter false flag.
[00:22:48.556 --> 00:22:55.258]  When you go and kill people to get other groups fighting and killing each other, that's one of the forms of classic false flag.
[00:22:55.258 --> 00:22:56.839]  People think of a classic false flag as
[00:22:58.393 --> 00:23:01.215]  You totally stage everything and blame it on another group.
[00:23:01.215 --> 00:23:06.378]  Well you can also go kill a bunch of real people to then also trigger something.
[00:23:06.378 --> 00:23:07.959]  And so that's a fact!
[00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:10.301]  And that's what's in his manifesto.
[00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:19.086]  But the left doesn't want us on air putting that out so they just say, oh, well first he said nobody died at Parkland, didn't say that, now he says nobody died there.
[00:23:19.086 --> 00:23:24.590]  And I'm not making the story about me, it's been made about myself.
[00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:24.930]  And then,
[00:23:26.697 --> 00:23:34.442]  Once that precedent is set to restrict Infowars, well next it's Jordan Peterson.
[00:23:34.442 --> 00:23:40.265]  New Zealand just banned his 12 Steps book.
[00:23:40.265 --> 00:23:46.208]  They just banned his book, but My Struggle Mein Kampf is still sold, and I think Mein Kampf should be sold.
[00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:48.810]  You should be able to read what Joe Stalin said.
[00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:51.071]  You should be able to read what Hitler said.
[00:23:51.071 --> 00:23:55.554]  I'll never forget, in high school, I went to buy a copy of My Struggle.
[00:23:57.312 --> 00:24:05.038]  Well, I was at the bookstore and I saw it, a big orange covered one, never saw that again, and I bought it and the lady thought I was a, she said, are you a Nazi?
[00:24:05.038 --> 00:24:09.542]  And I said, I forget, I was back one of those little bookstores at the mall.
[00:24:09.542 --> 00:24:10.883]  I said, ma'am, are you a Nazi?
[00:24:10.883 --> 00:24:12.564]  She said, well, why do you ask?
[00:24:12.564 --> 00:24:13.805]  I said, you're selling it.
[00:24:13.805 --> 00:24:20.130]  I mean, is the person selling Mein Kampf a bigger Nazi than the guy buying it?
[00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.653]  But see, she was projecting onto me because back then I had blonde hair.
[00:24:24.742 --> 00:24:26.523]  And I was, you know, in good shape.
[00:24:26.523 --> 00:24:31.485]  And I guess it did look like something out of an SS breeding program was there buying Mein Kampf.
[00:24:31.485 --> 00:24:35.926]  So I could see why she was projecting her idiocy onto me.
[00:24:35.926 --> 00:24:37.907]  I wanted to hear what Hitler actually had to say.
[00:24:37.907 --> 00:24:42.509]  That was a very badly written book and was not that interesting and a bunch of crap.
[00:24:42.509 --> 00:24:49.792]  But regardless, Jordan Peterson, the story's up on Infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:24:49.792 --> 00:24:52.493]  His book is banned in the wake of
[00:24:54.946 --> 00:24:57.027]  New Zealand shooting.
[00:24:57.027 --> 00:24:58.468]  What does he even have to do with that?
[00:24:58.468 --> 00:25:05.853]  He's more of kind of a almost like a leftist, nationalist, conservative, pro-male guy.
[00:25:05.853 --> 00:25:07.374]  He's very well spoken.
[00:25:07.374 --> 00:25:09.535]  He makes a lot of great points, some of which I don't agree with.
[00:25:09.535 --> 00:25:14.479]  I think the way the system's promoted him is a little bit creepy.
[00:25:14.479 --> 00:25:19.262]  But now you notice they're calling in mainline news for
[00:25:21.718 --> 00:25:25.139]  Ben Shapiro to be banned off the internet, de-platformed.
[00:25:25.139 --> 00:25:27.660]  And now they want Jordan Peterson.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.841]  They're never going to stop.
[00:25:31.841 --> 00:25:36.443]  Because for authoritarians, they want to be the only ones on air.
[00:25:36.443 --> 00:25:48.307]  If they got all conservatives or nationalists or libertarians off the air, if they were able to do that, they would then start taking each other off the air because it's still competition.
[00:25:50.871 --> 00:25:52.132]  And again, that's not my opinion.
[00:25:52.132 --> 00:26:15.861]  If you study Eastern Germany under the Russians and under the Stasi, there was one movie production company, one theater production company, one vacation company, one power company, one clothing company, and it was all run by czars who were incredibly rich and powerful.
[00:26:15.861 --> 00:26:16.341]  Kingpins.
[00:26:17.668 --> 00:26:22.370]  And everyone had to fight and die, you know, who wanted to be in the arts.
[00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:29.093]  And then you had to get your books approved, your essays approved, and it was a nightmare situation.
[00:26:29.093 --> 00:26:31.834]  A nightmare situation.
[00:26:31.834 --> 00:26:35.736]  And what they're building here is far, far worse.
[00:26:35.736 --> 00:26:41.358]  So they want to take their competition off, and then they want to start taking each other off, as you've seen the left actually eating its own.
[00:26:41.358 --> 00:26:44.199]  It's a very dangerous paradigm.
[00:26:44.199 --> 00:26:46.040]  So when we come back, I'm going to get more into this, because
[00:26:48.888 --> 00:26:55.553]  They're using New Zealand because they can create a consensus to take guns and take speech and say, look, New Zealand did it.
[00:26:55.553 --> 00:26:56.974]  We should do it.
[00:26:56.974 --> 00:26:58.155]  So it's even more suspicious.
[00:26:58.155 --> 00:26:59.616]  He got the guns in there.
[00:26:59.616 --> 00:27:01.117]  He admits he's a leftist.
[00:27:01.117 --> 00:27:03.159]  He wants to depopulate people.
[00:27:03.159 --> 00:27:05.081]  He wants to cause this global revolution.
[00:27:05.081 --> 00:27:13.127]  And now the media is following his directives lockstep and trying to foment race war and trying to get the guns and trying to create the consensus out of.
[00:27:14.278 --> 00:27:17.500]  The situation in New Zealand.
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.623]  So the thing really does stink to high heaven.
[00:27:20.623 --> 00:27:23.365]  Oh, but don't don't question crimes in America like the O.J.
[00:27:23.365 --> 00:27:24.085]  Simpson.
[00:27:24.085 --> 00:27:26.727]  It was all sorts of people questioning who really did that.
[00:27:26.727 --> 00:27:27.868]  That's how he got off.
[00:27:27.868 --> 00:27:30.090]  I mean, that's an Americana thing to question.
[00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:31.451]  But don't you do that.
[00:27:31.451 --> 00:27:32.131]  Don't you do that.
[00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:36.454]  That's the dirtiest, worst thing you could ever do.
[00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:36.955]  It's amazing.
[00:27:38.575 --> 00:27:39.716]  We're going to go to break.
[00:27:39.716 --> 00:27:44.038]  We're running huge specials that are going to have to end this weekend.
[00:27:44.038 --> 00:27:48.460]  A lot of them, because a lot of the great products at m4store.com are unfortunately set to sell out.
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.543]  But we're running hourly specials that are the biggest specials in our history.

[00:28:03.357 --> 00:28:11.783]  These are unprecedented deals, but every hour we have a special we run for only that hour where there's an additional discount.
[00:28:11.783 --> 00:28:13.985]  X2, back in stock, thought we couldn't get it.

[00:28:26.735 --> 00:28:28.316]  Can you blow that up on screen?
[00:28:28.316 --> 00:28:29.477]  Is that 8,000 plus reviews?
[00:28:30.337 --> 00:28:33.360]  8,100 and plus reviews?
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.021]  I mean, that is incredible.
[00:28:35.021 --> 00:28:37.963]  Okay, my eyes aren't as easy to read.
[00:28:37.963 --> 00:28:40.325]  6,193 reviews.

[00:28:51.314 --> 00:28:52.154]  I almost forgot.
[00:28:52.154 --> 00:28:52.875]  Huge specials.
[00:28:52.875 --> 00:28:53.656]  Take advantage of them.
[00:28:53.656 --> 00:28:54.616]  Support the InfoWar.
[00:28:54.616 --> 00:28:55.997]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:28:55.997 --> 00:28:56.498]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:01.862]  Ew, get the stinky dog away from me.
[00:29:01.862 --> 00:29:03.343]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[00:29:03.343 --> 00:29:04.664]  PDE stopped eating.
[00:29:04.664 --> 00:29:05.884]  All his hair fell out.
[00:29:05.884 --> 00:29:08.065]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[00:29:08.065 --> 00:29:09.946]  At least $5,000 in fat bills.
[00:29:09.946 --> 00:29:12.327]  Creams, antibiotics, sprays.
[00:29:12.327 --> 00:29:13.268]  No results.
[00:29:13.268 --> 00:29:15.769]  Everything we tried failed except the DynaVite.
[00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:18.670]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.811]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you gotta feed it something healthy.
[00:29:21.051 --> 00:29:22.833]  The omega-3 fatty acids.
[00:29:22.833 --> 00:29:24.774]  Flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa.
[00:29:24.774 --> 00:29:28.817]  The digestive enzymes that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[00:29:28.817 --> 00:29:30.979]  Dynovite is nutrition.
[00:29:30.979 --> 00:29:32.780]  The shedding is stopped and the itching is stopped.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:38.404]  Her coat is not soft, it's silky, it's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[00:29:38.404 --> 00:29:39.965]  She's got life, she's got energy.
[00:29:39.965 --> 00:29:41.947]  Tons of energy, no more bad smell.
[00:29:41.947 --> 00:29:43.328]  Dynovite's the bomb.
[00:29:43.328 --> 00:29:46.831]  Dynovite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[00:29:46.831 --> 00:29:48.292]  You know, besides me, of course.
[00:29:48.712 --> 00:29:49.433]  859-428-1000.
[00:29:49.433 --> 00:29:50.153]  859-428-1000.
[00:29:50.153 --> 00:29:54.097]  Dinovite for life.
[00:29:54.097 --> 00:30:00.523]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[00:30:00.523 --> 00:30:03.606]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew they canned food.
[00:30:03.606 --> 00:30:06.549]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:09.491]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:14.055]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of MyPatriotSupply, one of the top
[00:30:15.086 --> 00:30:24.237]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[00:30:24.237 --> 00:30:29.583]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[00:30:29.583 --> 00:30:31.866]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[00:30:31.866 --> 00:30:34.990]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:36.851]  They've got special diet foods.
[00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:40.833]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[00:30:40.833 --> 00:30:42.834]  They've got so many great products there.
[00:30:42.834 --> 00:30:44.615]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[00:30:44.615 --> 00:30:46.596]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[00:30:46.596 --> 00:30:49.098]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:54.121]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[00:30:54.121 --> 00:30:59.504]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot supply.
[00:31:00.728 --> 00:31:10.411]  There is a publicly admitted international plan to shut down nationalist, pro-free market, pro-Western speech all across the world.
[00:31:10.411 --> 00:31:16.852]  And I don't want to say I'm honored, but in a way I am, to have been chosen first last year to be de-platformed.
[00:31:16.852 --> 00:31:18.373]  Then they set the precedent.
[00:31:18.373 --> 00:31:22.494]  Now if you try to tell somebody the dangers of vaccines and read off the insert,
[00:31:23.234 --> 00:31:24.716]  They take you off the internet.
[00:31:24.716 --> 00:31:35.528]  Now Google announced just today that they're not going to take Christian advertising of most types on their platform because it upsets the San Francisco Google employees.
[00:31:35.528 --> 00:31:37.731]  Our country and the world more and more is in the grip
[00:31:38.191 --> 00:31:46.337]  Of anti-free speech, hyper-leftist, anti-human, transhumanist, who literally think they own and run our lives.
[00:31:46.337 --> 00:31:55.082]  And if we keep bowing to these cults, the cancer that is San Francisco, and many of these big universities, is going to be the operating system of the planet.
[00:31:55.082 --> 00:31:58.605]  Humanity must awaken and say no to these control freaks!
[00:31:59.943 --> 00:32:05.368]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:32:05.368 --> 00:32:07.169]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:08.911]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[00:32:08.911 --> 00:32:10.752]  Now, I can make them strong.
[00:32:10.752 --> 00:32:12.414]  Now, I can instruct them.
[00:32:12.414 --> 00:32:14.135]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[00:32:14.135 --> 00:32:15.116]  But not once I'm gone.
[00:32:15.216 --> 00:32:20.359]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:25.963]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:32:25.963 --> 00:32:29.586]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:32:29.586 --> 00:32:34.569]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[00:32:34.569 --> 00:32:41.454]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[00:32:41.454 --> 00:32:45.116]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:32:45.216 --> 00:32:52.845]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:32:52.845 --> 00:33:03.337]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:33:03.337 --> 00:33:05.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:22.534 --> 00:33:26.787]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:33:26.787 --> 00:33:28.251]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:33.587 --> 00:33:34.728]  Well, a second U.S.
[00:33:34.728 --> 00:33:37.449]  jury has found that Roundup weed killer causes cancer.
[00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:39.491]  They always knew that.
[00:33:39.491 --> 00:33:40.731]  Also, not a good situation.
[00:33:40.731 --> 00:33:44.033]  Trump denounces TSA child grope video.
[00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:45.514]  Well, let's not blame the TSA agents.
[00:33:45.514 --> 00:33:50.697]  Let's blame Congress and these laws that leave the borders open, let jihadis in, and then grope little kids.
[00:33:50.697 --> 00:33:52.599]  The president's right to decry it.
[00:33:52.599 --> 00:33:54.119]  That's an Infowars.com story.
[00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:55.820]  We have that video coming up next hour.
[00:33:57.101 --> 00:34:07.248]  Also, young people on amphetamines for ADHD have twice the psychosis and psychotic break risk compared to other stimulants, study says.
[00:34:07.248 --> 00:34:08.069]  Oh, wow!
[00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:09.330]  We told you that 20 years ago.
[00:34:11.052 --> 00:34:13.773]  You mean amphetamines makes people go schizo?
[00:34:13.773 --> 00:34:15.914]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[00:34:15.914 --> 00:34:23.356]  Oh, remember they made fun of me years ago saying Soros funded weaponized marijuana being legalized and that it causes psychosis and schizophrenia?
[00:34:23.356 --> 00:34:30.398]  Now a whole bunch of studies are out that schizophrenia is just off the charts because of weaponized marijuana.
[00:34:30.398 --> 00:34:31.939]  I'm a pro-legalization dude.
[00:34:31.939 --> 00:34:34.679]  I don't smoke marijuana often myself.
[00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.020]  Only I'm on the Joe Rogan Podcast.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.700]  It's a rite of passage, I guess.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:39.181]  But, because it makes me paranoid.
[00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:45.994]  People smoking this weaponized marijuana that I've known have turned into schizophrenic lunatics.
[00:34:45.994 --> 00:34:55.683]  I have known people that were completely normal, held down jobs, had good lives, and they started smoking weaponized marijuana and started thinking space aliens were in their attic.
[00:34:56.770 --> 00:34:58.151]  Okay, so there's big studies on that.
[00:34:58.151 --> 00:35:00.632]  I'm going to get to that next hour as well.
[00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:04.575]  Venezuelan forces detain key aid to the opposition leader.
[00:35:04.575 --> 00:35:06.616]  Things are really heating up there.
[00:35:06.616 --> 00:35:09.137]  There's so much we're going to be breaking down.
[00:35:09.137 --> 00:35:14.060]  We've got a bunch of other big guests lined up today, but I saw this video.
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:22.965]  It's gone viral, millions of views on YouTube and Facebook and everywhere else, and the research was so good, I actually knew a lot of the research, but I actually learned something from it.
[00:35:22.965 --> 00:35:25.207]  The brains behind AOC
[00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.754]  That's right, Alexandria Cortez.
[00:35:28.754 --> 00:35:30.418]  Who's really behind her?
[00:35:30.418 --> 00:35:35.187]  Well, the popular pundit, Mr. Reagan, on YouTube, Mr. Reagan.
[00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:38.087]  Thanks for joining us, Mr. Reagan.
[00:36:05.026 --> 00:36:06.166]  Thank you.
[00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:18.410]  Well, let's just get into AOC because we all think she's an idiot, but to the average leftist Beto supporter or whatever, Beto supporter or AOC supporter, I mean, they really like what they hear.
[00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.830]  Yeah.
[00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:19.290]  Yeah.
[00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:25.532]  I mean, she she is completely unqualified for the position that she has, but she is charismatic.
[00:36:25.532 --> 00:36:28.773]  I mean, the people who like her love her.
[00:36:28.773 --> 00:36:29.153]  Right.
[00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:34.055]  So she's the perfect mouthpiece for this group, the Justice Democrats.
[00:36:35.015 --> 00:36:40.798]  And for this guy, sidecut Chakra Bharti and his friends.
[00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:45.420]  So watching your video, you lay it all out, but basically she's a cutout for these powerful politicos.
[00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.181]  Lay it out for folks.
[00:36:47.694 --> 00:36:50.697]  Well, it's more than just Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[00:36:50.697 --> 00:36:54.541]  So there was a group called Brand New Congress, right?
[00:36:54.541 --> 00:36:58.064]  And I've learned a lot more since I put out the video.
[00:36:58.064 --> 00:37:00.526]  And I'm going to put out another video tomorrow.
[00:37:00.526 --> 00:37:02.989]  And this video is going to reveal a lot more.
[00:37:02.989 --> 00:37:07.453]  It's a lot bigger than I originally thought.
[00:37:07.453 --> 00:37:11.617]  But their idea is to replace all the Democrats in Congress
[00:37:12.682 --> 00:37:19.323]  With their own what they call progressives, which is a code word for socialists, Marxists, right?
[00:37:19.323 --> 00:37:33.506]  So they want to put in these really far left, you know, hardcore socialist types all through Congress to replace all the what they call establishment Democrats with these progressives.
[00:37:33.506 --> 00:37:35.867]  But really, I think they want to control a lot of these people.
[00:37:35.867 --> 00:37:40.568]  I've talked to some of the people that are close to the campaign, and this is one of the things I'm going to reveal in the next video.
[00:37:42.131 --> 00:37:46.133]  They are not looking for people who are independent minded.
[00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:52.056]  They're not looking for representatives of the constituencies that are voting for these Congress people.
[00:37:52.056 --> 00:37:57.539]  They are looking for people who will simply parrot their platform, right?
[00:37:57.539 --> 00:38:02.782]  They want people who are so in line with what they're thinking or who are so malleable.
[00:38:02.782 --> 00:38:09.425]  Like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, I don't think she ever knew enough about politics to contest anything that they tell her to say.
[00:38:10.143 --> 00:38:15.945]  Right, she just doesn't have the knowledge or the experience to be able to say, well, no, I don't actually agree with you guys.
[00:38:15.945 --> 00:38:17.125]  I'm going to go my own way.
[00:38:17.125 --> 00:38:26.488]  And I should add, you've been not just doing internet research, you've been actually reaching out, contacting sources around her and confirming what I've confirmed about Beto O'Rourke.
[00:38:26.488 --> 00:38:28.148]  He's super stupid.
[00:38:28.148 --> 00:38:29.989]  I actually believe he's a messiah.
[00:38:29.989 --> 00:38:38.691]  He's told everything that he's supposed to say, but he is a perfect vessel, a shallow husk that just repeats what he's told.
[00:38:40.478 --> 00:38:58.125]  That's interesting that you say that, because I may or may not have found a link between one of the presidential candidates and this group, the Justice Democrats, and it may or may not be Beto O'Rourke.
[00:38:58.125 --> 00:39:03.127]  I'm kind of keeping that stuff close to the vest, but that's, yeah, you're onto something there, I think.
[00:39:04.329 --> 00:39:05.390]  But I think you're on to it.
[00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:10.173]  They're coming up with a totally mindless puppet that these corporate globalists can control.
[00:39:10.173 --> 00:39:12.575]  And so this is the next wave.
[00:39:12.575 --> 00:39:15.077]  This is the future.
[00:39:15.077 --> 00:39:19.740]  Yeah, I mean, for sure, there is a connection to Soros here.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:24.183]  A lot of people dismiss the Soros thing as conspiracy theory stuff.
[00:39:24.183 --> 00:39:27.286]  But I would say, OK.
[00:39:27.286 --> 00:39:32.269]  When I originally came up with the video, I said, Cenk Uygur is like the brains behind AOC, right?
[00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:33.270]  He's like the mastermind.
[00:39:34.588 --> 00:39:35.449]  That was a mistake.
[00:39:35.449 --> 00:39:37.051]  That was not accurate.
[00:39:37.051 --> 00:39:38.453]  Okay.
[00:39:38.453 --> 00:39:41.056]  Saikat Chakrabarty is sort of her controller.
[00:39:41.056 --> 00:39:47.043]  He's the one that is currently her chief of staff and was her campaign manager.
[00:39:47.043 --> 00:39:49.926]  But he actually answers to somebody else.
[00:39:49.926 --> 00:39:53.771]  And I'm going to go ahead and give you this information, but this is something that's going to be in the video tomorrow.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:40:00.685]  The main guy, the main brains behind the whole thing, the mastermind, is Zack Exley.
[00:40:00.685 --> 00:40:11.474]  Zack Exley is the guy, he kind of came up with this concept of the brand new Congress, replacing Congress a while back, and it's a much bigger plan than has been laid out so far.
[00:40:11.474 --> 00:40:16.218]  They've sort of just, basically what we've seen is the pilot program.
[00:40:16.218 --> 00:40:19.521]  The bigger program is yet to come, and I'm going to lay it all out in my next video.
[00:40:21.357 --> 00:40:21.878]  Wow!
[00:40:21.878 --> 00:40:31.640]  I mean, that's my research, is they want, quote, all these new young people, all this new, quote, feminist movement as well that goes with it, and then kind of have a whole pop culture built around it.
[00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:33.571]  Yeah, that's the guy.
[00:40:33.571 --> 00:40:35.112]  You've got him right there.
[00:40:35.112 --> 00:40:37.433]  It's not just the fact that they're young.
[00:40:37.433 --> 00:40:40.395]  I mean, these people are straight-up neo-Marxists.
[00:40:40.395 --> 00:40:45.219]  And what I mean by neo-Marxist is that they buy a whole hog into the idea of socialism.
[00:40:45.219 --> 00:40:47.480]  Into, like, Soviet Union-style socialism.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.441]  You know, they want this to be Venezuela.
[00:40:49.441 --> 00:40:50.702]  Sure, this is the Weathermen 2.0.
[00:40:50.702 --> 00:40:51.523]  What's the Weathermen?
[00:40:51.523 --> 00:40:59.248]  Well, when I say the Weathermen, I mean, you know, back then the Communists were violent, wanted to overthrow.
[00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:00.249]  Now they're just trying to get elected.
[00:41:01.929 --> 00:41:02.309]  Right.
[00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:06.333]  I mean, he says in a video, he says, look, you know, we've got this beautiful democratic system.
[00:41:06.333 --> 00:41:11.737]  Let's use the democratic system that we have to elect officials so that we can take over the government.
[00:41:12.858 --> 00:41:13.778]  That's an actual statement.
[00:41:13.778 --> 00:41:17.239]  I'm going to play the audio on my video so everybody can hear it.
[00:41:17.239 --> 00:41:20.060]  It's not, like, I'm not just making this stuff up out of thin air.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.280]  This is all documented.
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.160]  He does a ton of interviews.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.402]  Tell us about, because I've only seen Zach Exley a couple times, but I knew he was involved.
[00:41:26.402 --> 00:41:32.483]  And from your research, you believe he's her main handler and kind of beta testing with her.
[00:41:32.483 --> 00:41:35.124]  Tell us about Zach Exley.
[00:41:35.124 --> 00:41:37.264]  Zach Exley is an interesting character.
[00:41:37.264 --> 00:41:39.005]  He grew up, I think, in Connecticut.
[00:41:40.615 --> 00:41:47.138]  You know, fairly well-off family, and his parents were strong atheists.
[00:41:47.138 --> 00:42:02.844]  So he grew up this very strong, hard-left atheist, basically taught to distrust and hate Christians, thinking Christians are psychopaths who believe, you know, who are all racist, homophobic, you know, sexist, you know, degenerates.
[00:42:02.844 --> 00:42:07.926]  And then he met his wife, I think in 2003 or something, they got married, and she was a Christian.
[00:42:08.985 --> 00:42:10.186]  And so she took him to church.
[00:42:10.186 --> 00:42:14.049]  And he wanted to go to church because he wanted to see this phenomenon of all these crazy people.
[00:42:14.049 --> 00:42:16.071]  I mean, that's really why he wanted to go.
[00:42:16.071 --> 00:42:19.853]  But what he found was he ended up going to a very far-left church.
[00:42:19.853 --> 00:42:22.015]  And he ended up becoming a Christian.
[00:42:22.015 --> 00:42:27.840]  This is something I'm not even going to talk about in the video, but he became this far-left... So he didn't really change his ideology.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:34.044]  He didn't say, OK, because of Christ and Christianity, I'm going to change my... No, he's an ecumenicalist now, liberation theology.
[00:42:34.044 --> 00:42:36.046]  He's going to use it to create a leftist religion.
[00:42:37.601 --> 00:42:38.562]  Absolutely.
[00:42:38.562 --> 00:42:39.002]  Absolutely.
[00:42:39.002 --> 00:42:40.803]  He kind of does the same thing the terrorists do.
[00:42:40.803 --> 00:42:49.106]  He evokes the Bible to justify what he's doing as opposed to... And if you track him, you're going to find Carnegie Endowment, Ford Foundation, Liberation Theology.
[00:42:49.106 --> 00:42:52.328]  It's all been cooked up by a certain three-letter agency.
[00:42:52.328 --> 00:42:57.190]  We'll be right back with Mr. Reagan and his great expose of AOC and more.
[00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.570]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.326 --> 00:43:04.413]  And now, through the end of March, we are running the biggest special of this year.

[00:43:59.289 --> 00:44:01.991]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[00:44:01.991 --> 00:44:08.356]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[00:44:08.356 --> 00:44:10.097]  Don't let life weigh you down.
[00:44:10.097 --> 00:44:16.962]  Happies is a powerful mood and stress support formula that has your back against life's daily inconveniences.
[00:44:16.962 --> 00:44:22.766]  Made with ancient ingredients used for thousands of years, Happies can help you take back the day.
[00:44:23.126 --> 00:44:23.446]  I think so.
[00:44:42.779 --> 00:44:43.580]  Don't you agree?
[00:45:00.222 --> 00:45:10.826]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:45:10.826 --> 00:45:12.886]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:45:12.886 --> 00:45:15.747]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:45:15.747 --> 00:45:17.248]  It's made in the USA.
[00:45:17.248 --> 00:45:20.369]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:45:20.609 --> 00:45:24.052]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:45:24.052 --> 00:45:26.154]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:45:26.154 --> 00:45:35.862]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:45:35.862 --> 00:45:48.432]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:53.654]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[00:45:53.654 --> 00:45:55.495]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[00:46:11.442 --> 00:46:14.544]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[00:46:14.544 --> 00:46:16.106]  I didn't invent all this.
[00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:22.671]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[00:46:22.671 --> 00:46:25.473]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:29.874]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[00:46:29.874 --> 00:46:32.795]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[00:46:32.795 --> 00:46:34.495]  That sends chills up my spine.
[00:46:34.495 --> 00:46:48.039]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[00:46:48.039 --> 00:46:49.980]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:55.904]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[00:46:55.904 --> 00:47:03.351]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[00:47:03.351 --> 00:47:06.013]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:22.294 --> 00:47:26.378]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:47:26.378 --> 00:47:30.221]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:30.221 --> 00:47:36.967]  You know, it's sad that we see massive draconian censorship against nationalists, conservatives, Christians, and others because we're so popular.
[00:47:36.967 --> 00:47:42.672]  But as they ban more of us, just more people come forward because they're standing up for their families.
[00:47:42.672 --> 00:47:46.836]  And they're just as well-spoken or more well-spoken than those of us that get banned in many places.
[00:47:46.836 --> 00:47:48.497]  And so the depth of our chart
[00:47:49.332 --> 00:47:52.655]  This is a football game, it's getting very, very deep and very, very good.
[00:47:52.655 --> 00:47:58.460]  Meanwhile, you go to a leftist rally, it's... I don't take pleasure at how dumbed down they are, how cult-like they are, how stupid they are.
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:06.046]  There's new videos on InfoWars.com that Caitlin Bennett shot, and they're like, one's 12 minutes, one's 15 minutes, and they're unedited.
[00:48:06.046 --> 00:48:07.807]  Other than in between the people.
[00:48:07.807 --> 00:48:13.712]  And she'll talk to 30 people who support Beto O'Rourke, but don't know what his real name is.
[00:48:13.712 --> 00:48:15.534]  Or who physically attack her.
[00:48:15.534 --> 00:48:18.256]  And it's just, they're invincibly ignorant.
[00:48:20.128 --> 00:48:25.689]  We're going to go back to Mr. Reagan here in a moment, who has, from his own research, ferreted out who's handling her, who's manipulating her.
[00:48:25.689 --> 00:48:29.950]  We know Beto O'Rourke, number one funder of his foundation, that Soros funds.
[00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:35.072]  Same thing with her, but what's the new ideology, the new variant of leftist garbage?
[00:48:35.072 --> 00:48:48.475]  With national polls, 44 to about 55% of leftists out there actually, well, tell millennials, 44 to 55%, say they're socialists or communists.
[00:48:48.475 --> 00:48:49.495]  That's just horrifying.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:57.704]  Yeah, well, you know, I was saying before, it's not just a socialist, it's neo-Marxism, right?
[00:48:57.704 --> 00:49:05.289]  Neo-Marxism doesn't just take in this socialist, communist idea, which is, to me, completely mental.
[00:49:05.289 --> 00:49:09.972]  It's not just economic, it's totally social, where you play everybody up against each other.
[00:49:09.972 --> 00:49:10.492]  That's right.
[00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:17.977]  So they're bringing in this extra, this added delusion of, you know, oppression and oppressor.
[00:49:18.715 --> 00:49:18.955]  Right?
[00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:22.838]  So they say, these are the oppressed people, and they're the good victims.
[00:49:22.838 --> 00:49:23.298]  Right?
[00:49:23.298 --> 00:49:26.280]  And these are the oppressors, and they're evil.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:26.520]  Right?
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:31.163]  And you should hate them, and you should love these people, and that's their platform.
[00:49:31.163 --> 00:49:31.343]  Right?
[00:49:31.343 --> 00:49:43.050]  And that's Exley's platform, that's Saikat Chakrabarty's platform, that's AOC's platform, that's Beto's platform, and it's mental, because some of these guys are straight, white, Christian men.
[00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:45.272]  And they're saying, straight, white, Christian men are evil.
[00:49:46.135 --> 00:49:48.336]  In fact, that's the litmus test.
[00:49:48.336 --> 00:49:50.436]  Beto this week said, white men are bad.
[00:49:50.436 --> 00:49:51.456]  I'm sorry, I'm bad.
[00:49:51.456 --> 00:49:53.157]  I don't get that.
[00:49:53.157 --> 00:49:54.797]  I mean, I don't get that.
[00:49:54.797 --> 00:49:57.978]  That's clearly bigotry.
[00:49:57.978 --> 00:50:00.839]  I mean, that's exactly what we've been fighting against.
[00:50:00.839 --> 00:50:04.440]  It's a 180 the opposite of Martin Luther King's Veritas.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.280]  Yeah, and Lincoln.
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.780]  I mean, we free the slaves.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:09.561]  We're trying to create civil rights in America.
[00:50:09.561 --> 00:50:12.422]  And then people turn around and say, actually, white people are evil.
[00:50:13.084 --> 00:50:23.928]  Actually, men are all... And as you know, up until the Civil War, only 2% of people had slaves, and most whites' ancestors came here after the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery.
[00:50:23.928 --> 00:50:27.210]  I mean, it's just... Yeah, my family came here after the Civil War.
[00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:28.650]  Yeah.
[00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:29.190]  Yeah.
[00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:30.511]  And I'd also say, look,
[00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:34.153]  People often talk about reparations, right?
[00:50:34.153 --> 00:50:35.354]  People often talk about reparations.
[00:50:35.354 --> 00:50:42.823]  I say this, what about the reparations that were paid in blood by the men who died for the freedom of the slaves in the Civil War?
[00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:58.447]  You're absolutely right, but what's crazy is it was the Democrats who blocked reparations at the time when the Republicans wanted a couple hundred acres and three mules and $50, $100, it was all debated.
[00:50:58.447 --> 00:51:03.133]  The Democrats finally settled on 40 acres and a mule, but then they tried to block that in the South.
[00:51:03.813 --> 00:51:05.395]  I'm not bad for the South.
[00:51:05.395 --> 00:51:09.639]  It's just it was the Democrats blocked original reparations directly to slaves.
[00:51:09.639 --> 00:51:10.400]  You're gonna have it.
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:11.561]  Hey, you've been a slave.
[00:51:11.561 --> 00:51:12.782]  Here's a future.
[00:51:12.782 --> 00:51:13.523]  Here's some land.
[00:51:13.523 --> 00:51:14.424]  You're a farmer.
[00:51:14.424 --> 00:51:16.466]  You don't know anything else to do.
[00:51:16.466 --> 00:51:17.207]  Get on your feet.
[00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:18.468]  Here's a farm.
[00:51:18.468 --> 00:51:20.110]  No, the Democrats blocked it.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.641]  You know your history, my friend.
[00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:23.722]  Well, I don't mean to rant.
[00:51:23.722 --> 00:51:26.185]  I've got you here to talk about AOC.
[00:51:26.185 --> 00:51:27.887]  So how is it going for them?
[00:51:27.887 --> 00:51:33.392]  Because no matter how dumb they are and how corrupt, they get more and more popular with liberals, but unpopular with conservatives.
[00:51:33.392 --> 00:51:40.239]  So how is this move to communism and socialism and cultural Marxism going right now in the country?
[00:51:40.239 --> 00:51:44.163]  Well, you know, they just did a poll with AOC, and she polled relatively poorly.
[00:51:45.104 --> 00:51:48.306]  Um, but of course the mainstream media doesn't want to report that.
[00:51:48.306 --> 00:51:49.406]  So, but they kind of have to, right?
[00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:50.186]  That's news.
[00:51:50.186 --> 00:51:51.167]  That's news.
[00:51:51.167 --> 00:51:53.208]  So, 37% still too high.
[00:51:53.208 --> 00:51:58.830]  Oh, it absolutely is still too high, but she's a very charismatic person, right?
[00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:03.272]  I mean, this is the kind of concept of the left and of socialism.
[00:52:03.272 --> 00:52:07.934]  You want a charismatic leader at the top, inspiring people to believe delusions, right?
[00:52:07.934 --> 00:52:08.454]  That's it.
[00:52:08.454 --> 00:52:11.996]  I mean, people will believe stuff if you have somebody that's charismatic enough telling them.
[00:52:12.952 --> 00:52:16.113]  So she's selling the Kool-Aid to the Jim Jones compound?
[00:52:16.113 --> 00:52:16.653]  That's right.
[00:52:16.653 --> 00:52:22.655]  And actually, I think it was Lennon that said, if you say a lie often enough, it becomes the truth.
[00:52:22.655 --> 00:52:24.616]  So what do you think's in AOC's future?
[00:52:24.616 --> 00:52:29.278]  Because I agree, the think tanks and the leftist groups, they're all pushing people like her, and she's the beta test.
[00:52:29.278 --> 00:52:34.159]  But the Democratic Party thinks she's hurting them, and there's some talk about them jettisoning her.
[00:52:34.159 --> 00:52:38.641]  But the next day, Susan went to prison for nine months for a $20,000 campaign contribution.
[00:52:38.641 --> 00:52:39.701]  He didn't fill out paperwork.
[00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:40.822]  She's kept over a million.
[00:52:40.822 --> 00:52:41.762]  What do you think's going to happen there?
[00:52:44.395 --> 00:52:57.907]  Well, you know, from the research that I've done, and I can't prove this, so this is all speculation, this is all preliminary research, stuff that people have told me and stuff that seems to be true from what I've seen.
[00:52:57.907 --> 00:52:59.228]  This is all Exley.
[00:52:59.228 --> 00:53:00.949]  Exley's been doing this for a while now.
[00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:08.336]  He's run several campaigns before this, you know, brand new Congress, Justice Democrats thing.
[00:53:08.336 --> 00:53:10.938]  And this sort of shell game of moving money around,
[00:53:11.901 --> 00:53:13.902]  Uh, to different PACs and stuff like that.
[00:53:13.902 --> 00:53:15.183]  That's his thing, right?
[00:53:15.183 --> 00:53:20.526]  He developed this technique to essentially, I think, hide money so it doesn't have to be reported.
[00:53:20.526 --> 00:53:33.632]  Um, so I think that if the people investigating this look more at him, and there's a name, there's the name of one of the PACs that I was given as a tip, and I can't research this stuff because I'm not an actual reporter.
[00:53:33.632 --> 00:53:40.556]  Well, let's admit it, he's involved and they raised 18 million and she pocketed, I mean, a million's disappeared at least.
[00:53:41.752 --> 00:53:42.752]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:46.934]  I mean, they're going to find some nefarious stuff.
[00:53:46.934 --> 00:53:48.295]  Who's going to get in trouble for that?
[00:53:48.295 --> 00:53:49.015]  I don't know.
[00:53:49.015 --> 00:53:55.758]  It almost certainly won't be Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, because I don't think she knows anything that's going on.
[00:53:55.758 --> 00:53:56.819]  I think she's just a puppet.
[00:53:57.858 --> 00:54:01.740]  Well, that's like Bernie Sanders, his wife swindling a university.
[00:54:01.740 --> 00:54:03.761]  He's got three $1 million houses.
[00:54:03.761 --> 00:54:04.462]  He drives $109,000 cars.
[00:54:04.462 --> 00:54:09.144]  And the thing is, it's okay if he hasn't stolen the money.
[00:54:09.144 --> 00:54:10.745]  He's never had a real job in his life.
[00:54:10.745 --> 00:54:19.691]  These Democrats, just like you see in Venezuela, these socialists always live like kings, but they're telling everybody else that they, you know, should be poor.
[00:54:19.691 --> 00:54:24.253]  Yeah, I was on another radio show and I said, look, they're practicing socialism now.
[00:54:24.253 --> 00:54:25.474]  You're calling it hypocrisy.
[00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.471]  But this is socialism.
[00:54:27.471 --> 00:54:33.756]  I mean, socialism is you've got this very thin layer of super rich at the top and then everybody else is dirt poor, right?
[00:54:33.756 --> 00:54:42.763]  And so the concept of like these elites, you know, encouraging the people at like, say, Occupy Wall Street who are living in tents and, you know,
[00:54:44.116 --> 00:54:59.328]  Absolutely filthy, but then these elites on the on the on the top are going and saying these elite hotels Well, that's you know, that is socialism, right and people don't realize they think oh, it's it's gonna raise up the you know black people and women and gay people know it isn't
[00:55:00.231 --> 00:55:01.371]  It's all about divide and conquer.
[00:55:01.371 --> 00:55:12.454]  We're going to go to break, and I want to do five more minutes with you and get more tips on what, because you're being polite, you're being nice and saying, you know, I'm not a journalist, but you put together a lot of the research, you've gone public, now you're getting more contacts.
[00:55:12.454 --> 00:55:17.076]  I've seen your video, and what you talk about in it is documented, and it's good to know you're out there, but I want to ask you,
[00:55:18.216 --> 00:55:21.078]  How you think we go on the offense against this when we come back in just two minutes.
[00:55:21.078 --> 00:55:21.819]  Okay.
[00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:26.622]  Folks, we are four hours in basically to the 50-hour special transmission.
[00:55:26.622 --> 00:55:28.343]  David Knight came on at 8 a.m.
[00:55:28.343 --> 00:55:30.724]  I'm 55 minutes into this broadcast.
[00:55:30.724 --> 00:55:32.786]  We've got a bunch of other big guests today.
[00:55:32.786 --> 00:55:38.950]  And this is the Save the First Amendment, Stop Big Tech, Stop the Bias 50-hour broadcast.
[00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:41.892]  We've got everybody from Laura Loomer to Tommy Robinson joining us.
[00:55:43.211 --> 00:55:46.892]  I believe Joe said he could do it, but Joe is famously busy.
[00:55:46.892 --> 00:55:51.173]  Joe Rogan, I believe, will be in studio tomorrow at around 2 o'clock, okay?
[00:55:51.173 --> 00:55:52.534]  But regardless, I'm going to interview with him.
[00:55:52.534 --> 00:55:55.075]  He's coming to town, and there's a bunch of other surprise guests.
[00:55:55.075 --> 00:55:56.675]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:55:56.675 --> 00:56:04.998]  From now right through Saturday morning, 10 a.m., focal point on free speech and a focal point on what we're fighting and what the stakes are.
[00:56:04.998 --> 00:56:09.239]  Please don't forget, store-wide free shipping right now, 50% off all the supplements.

[00:56:19.383 --> 00:56:20.843]  And there's double Patriot points.

[00:56:26.864 --> 00:56:28.944]  It just goes on and on and on and on from there.
[00:56:28.944 --> 00:56:31.425]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:56:31.425 --> 00:56:32.305]  Halogens.
[00:56:32.305 --> 00:56:33.705]  There's a lot of bad halogens.
[00:56:33.705 --> 00:56:34.886]  Iodine's a good halogen.
[00:56:34.886 --> 00:56:36.826]  Most of the iodine out there is a bunch of bound garbage.
[00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:40.652]  If you don't have oxygen, if you don't have vitamin C, if you don't have water, you die.
[00:56:40.652 --> 00:56:42.734]  If you don't have iodine, finale.
[00:56:42.734 --> 00:56:44.196]  Takes a few months, but that's it.
[00:56:44.196 --> 00:56:44.516]  It's over.
[00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:48.711]  But most iodine's out of the soil or it's bound, you don't absorb it.
[00:56:48.711 --> 00:56:54.552]  Research iodine deficiencies and loss of brain power, lower IQ, you name it.
[00:56:54.552 --> 00:56:57.973]  Research iodine additives to your life, everything.
[00:56:57.973 --> 00:57:00.554]  Stamina, libido, your hormones are based on it.
[00:57:00.554 --> 00:57:01.354]  It's so important.
[00:57:01.354 --> 00:57:02.974]  X2, we thought we couldn't get anymore.
[00:57:02.974 --> 00:57:04.695]  The deep earth crystal, it's here.
[00:57:04.695 --> 00:57:05.875]  X3's excellent as well.
[00:57:05.875 --> 00:57:07.315]  It's a different type of deep earth crystal.
[00:57:07.315 --> 00:57:09.176]  Similar, but it's a different supplier.
[00:57:09.176 --> 00:57:10.416]  We've got to say it's a different formula.
[00:57:10.416 --> 00:57:12.436]  So out of the other two types, I think it's just as good.
[00:57:12.436 --> 00:57:14.577]  But the point is, X2's what you want.
[00:57:15.177 --> 00:57:17.558]  X2's available.
[00:57:17.558 --> 00:57:18.518]  55% off.
[00:57:18.518 --> 00:57:19.618]  Fluoride-free toothpaste.
[00:57:19.618 --> 00:57:20.158]  Super Blue.
[00:57:20.158 --> 00:57:22.479]  4-5 cloyal silver iodine.
[00:57:22.479 --> 00:57:25.339]  Super Blue, right now, is our best-selling product.

[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.360]  A bunch of stuff is selling out as well.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.360]  We'll have this.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.801]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:57:30.801 --> 00:57:30.981]  50% off.
[00:57:30.981 --> 00:57:33.741]  Go as long as we can until a lot of these items sell out.
[00:57:33.741 --> 00:57:36.782]  But each hour, there's a special at 55% off.
[00:57:36.782 --> 00:57:40.323]  So take advantage of X2 and help fund the tip of the spear in the fight against the global.
[00:57:40.824 --> 00:57:47.344]  Mr. Reagan, with his great reports on AOC, tells us how to fight back straight ahead.
[00:57:58.635 --> 00:58:07.639]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[00:58:07.639 --> 00:58:17.722]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[00:58:17.722 --> 00:58:26.246]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[00:58:27.086 --> 00:58:28.427]  There's nothing else like it.
[00:58:28.427 --> 00:58:29.587]  You must experience it.
[00:58:29.587 --> 00:58:31.528]  It is a total game-changer.
[00:58:31.528 --> 00:58:36.590]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:38.110]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:39.591]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[00:58:39.591 --> 00:58:46.273]  So take a half packet the first time you take it, because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.
[00:58:46.273 --> 00:58:47.754]  TurboForce at m4slive.com.
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.902]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[00:58:52.902 --> 00:58:59.167]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[00:58:59.167 --> 00:59:04.011]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[00:59:52.778 --> 00:59:55.442]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.861]  Alex Jones here back live.
[01:00:13.861 --> 01:00:18.226]  You know Alexandria Cortez or AOC.
[01:00:18.226 --> 01:00:20.088]  I'll call myself Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[01:00:20.088 --> 01:00:21.870]  They always put her middle name in there like she's royalty.
[01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:27.832]  She lied on test scores, it's turned out.
[01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:30.754]  I put the Red State article up on screen for TV viewers.
[01:00:30.754 --> 01:00:34.157]  Alexandria Cortez lied about her test scores to a public education group.
[01:00:34.157 --> 01:00:35.678]  Well, of course she did.
[01:00:35.678 --> 01:00:41.083]  I mean, Pocahontas lied on the bar here in Texas to say she was Native American, so she got into college.
[01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:42.344]  These are frauds.
[01:00:42.344 --> 01:00:44.525]  These are scamsters.
[01:00:44.525 --> 01:00:46.727]  These are virtue signalers.
[01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:48.348]  It's how they operate.
[01:00:48.348 --> 01:00:53.593]  But let me tell you, Beto O'Rourke got beaten by Ted Cruz even though they engaged in massive election fraud.
[01:00:54.738 --> 01:01:00.742]  But he did get record amounts of people registered, and he did get a bunch of Democrats elected, and they took over most of the courts.
[01:01:00.742 --> 01:01:03.924]  So Texas is within an inch of being blue.
[01:01:03.924 --> 01:01:04.404]  That's a fact!
[01:01:05.939 --> 01:01:17.387]  So, if anything, they're good to go out and get young people who want a free ride to basically like an angler fish advertise with that light of free goods.
[01:01:17.387 --> 01:01:19.889]  It's really a train coming head on at you.
[01:01:19.889 --> 01:01:27.394]  And that's really their job, from my research, is to get a bunch of young morons to smoke the socialist dope.
[01:01:27.394 --> 01:01:30.176]  Mr. Reagan, popular YouTube analyst, joins us.
[01:01:30.176 --> 01:01:32.818]  What do you think this is really all about and how do we counter it?
[01:01:34.341 --> 01:01:35.542]  I'll tell you what I think it's all about.
[01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:44.788]  I think it is about an outside group sort of taking over congressional seats, because these guys didn't just bring in AOC, right?
[01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:48.531]  They brought in Ayanna Pressley.
[01:01:48.531 --> 01:01:53.494]  They brought in Rashida Tlaib, or however you pronounce her name.
[01:01:53.494 --> 01:01:56.156]  They endorsed Ilhan Omar.
[01:01:56.156 --> 01:02:01.800]  I mean, I think there's seven people that they endorsed that are now in Congress, and I think they fully control three of them.
[01:02:02.498 --> 01:02:03.339]  Right.
[01:02:03.339 --> 01:02:05.362]  There are people that they brought in from the beginning.
[01:02:05.362 --> 01:02:19.982]  They're so they're dangerous because they're this entity that kind of I think they instruct these these congressmen or congresswomen how to vote what to propose to Congress what to tweet what to say to the American people.
[01:02:21.086 --> 01:02:23.768]  And that's not how Americans expect their democracy to be.
[01:02:23.768 --> 01:02:33.213]  Sure, so there's always been lobbyists, but you're now saying, from the ground up, they're creating and engineering people that are absolute, basically robots.
[01:02:33.213 --> 01:02:37.075]  Yes, it is the difference between control and influence, right?
[01:02:37.075 --> 01:02:39.176]  Influence, we don't like influence, right?
[01:02:39.176 --> 01:02:40.997]  But, you know, it's going to happen.
[01:02:40.997 --> 01:02:42.197]  But control is different.
[01:02:42.197 --> 01:02:43.998]  That is much more severe.
[01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:45.019]  These aren't leaders.
[01:02:45.019 --> 01:02:45.919]  These are drones.
[01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:48.822]  Yeah, they're drones.
[01:02:48.822 --> 01:02:51.103]  They're NPCs, if you will.
[01:02:51.103 --> 01:02:58.285]  And I think that the only way we can stop this, really, is to get the word out there to promote this idea.
[01:02:58.285 --> 01:03:04.447]  I mean, if you really want to know everything that's going on, you've got to subscribe to my YouTube channel, Mr. Reagan.
[01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.728]  Watch the next video I'm going to put out tomorrow.
[01:03:07.728 --> 01:03:09.328]  And then, you know, try to share that.
[01:03:09.328 --> 01:03:16.450]  Because the more people who know what's going on, like, if you know that this candidate is associated with Justice Democrats, right?
[01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:20.637]  That should trigger in your mind, I can't vote for this person.
[01:03:20.637 --> 01:03:24.843]  Because this person is not an autonomous, independent thinking person.
[01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:26.885]  They're controlled by this outside group.
[01:03:26.885 --> 01:03:27.726]  And we can't have that.
[01:03:27.726 --> 01:03:32.192]  We can't have outside groups controlling our government.
[01:03:32.192 --> 01:03:33.073]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:03:33.073 --> 01:03:35.736]  The fact that she's as phony as a plastic banana.
[01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:42.692]  And the fact that Beto O'Rourke is as well, and that they're just empty suits, is their Achilles heel.
[01:03:42.692 --> 01:03:44.414]  And also the hypocrisy.
[01:03:44.414 --> 01:03:49.398]  The $3,000, $5,000 suit she wears, and the private jets, and then she's saying it's all bad.
[01:03:49.398 --> 01:03:51.861]  And she goes, oh, this is the world I live in.
[01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:56.445]  So she's saying she's not going to make any sacrifice for what she thinks you should do.
[01:03:56.445 --> 01:03:58.607]  She just wants you to do what she says.
[01:03:58.607 --> 01:04:00.108]  Oh, you've got it right on the nose.
[01:04:00.108 --> 01:04:00.989]  The hypocrisy is
[01:04:01.978 --> 01:04:02.619]  Mental.
[01:04:02.619 --> 01:04:08.064]  I mean, really, if she was somebody who was passionate about the environment, she would already be doing these things.
[01:04:08.064 --> 01:04:13.410]  You know, she would already be avoiding the jets and, you know, doing all the environmentally stuff.
[01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:14.611]  She doesn't care about that stuff.
[01:04:14.611 --> 01:04:16.473]  She's doing that because her people told her to do it.
[01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:30.054]  And the hypocrisy is crazy because she's saying that the United States needs to adopt all of these things, despite the fact that other countries are far behind us, you know, with regard to how environmentally friendly we are, like China.
[01:04:30.054 --> 01:04:31.354]  But she's saying we need to lead the way.
[01:04:31.354 --> 01:04:32.895]  We need to be the example.
[01:04:32.895 --> 01:04:36.456]  But she will not be the example for her constituency, for her people.
[01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:37.996]  All right, Mr. Reagan, thanks for coming on.
[01:04:37.996 --> 01:04:39.197]  Can't wait to see your next report.
[01:04:39.197 --> 01:04:40.377]  You're doing a great job.
[01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:43.078]  God bless and Godspeed.
[01:04:43.078 --> 01:04:43.898]  All right, when we come back,
[01:04:45.609 --> 01:04:46.569]  I've got top U.S.
[01:04:46.569 --> 01:04:49.970]  generals coming out saying, yeah, no, China's working with Google to screw us over.
[01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:58.533]  But first, wait till you see Beto O'Rourke supporters, Beto O'Rourke, Beto O'Rourke, I'm sorry, not knowing his real name.
[01:04:58.533 --> 01:05:01.614]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[01:05:01.614 --> 01:05:04.535]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.535 --> 01:05:07.475]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootworkstore.com.
[01:05:07.475 --> 01:05:12.057]  With MFootwork Select, it's the full spectrum of MyPatriotSupply, one of the top
[01:05:13.106 --> 01:05:22.251]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[01:05:44.602 --> 01:05:47.103]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:47.103 --> 01:05:52.145]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:52.145 --> 01:05:57.527]  InfoWarsTore.com and InfoWarsSelect, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[01:06:06.972 --> 01:06:11.615]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:06:11.615 --> 01:06:14.777]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:14.777 --> 01:06:22.102]  Okay, I intend to open the phones up... At the bottom of the hour.
[01:06:22.102 --> 01:06:24.464]  On any subject, any issue you want to discuss.
[01:06:24.464 --> 01:06:26.085]  We're right smack dab in the middle.
[01:06:27.964 --> 01:06:29.664]  Well, it's really kicked off.
[01:06:29.664 --> 01:06:31.645]  Of the 50-hour broadcast, it started at 8 a.m.
[01:06:31.645 --> 01:06:36.646]  this morning with David Knight, and will run until Saturday morning at 10 a.m.
[01:06:36.646 --> 01:06:39.626]  That's 50-hour global transmission.
[01:06:39.626 --> 01:06:40.686]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:06:40.686 --> 01:06:41.826]  You go to InfoWars.com.
[01:06:41.826 --> 01:06:45.427]  There's a live feed article posted, and we're telling you the big guests that are coming up.
[01:06:45.427 --> 01:06:47.928]  A lot of big surprises.
[01:06:47.928 --> 01:06:51.148]  Joe thinks she'll be in studio if his plane's on time at 2 p.m.
[01:06:51.148 --> 01:06:52.908]  tomorrow, but regardless, we've got Joe Rogan coming in.
[01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.889]  A lot of stuff here on air.
[01:06:58.899 --> 01:07:25.184]  We got Tom Pappert coming up, George Norrie, Doug Hagman, Alyssa Andra Bacci, Ali Alexander, Julia Song, Carpe Dongtum, Will Johnson, Laura Loomer, Kaitlyn Bennett, Sebo, Paul Joseph Watson, Gerald Cilente, Mike Adams, Billy Weaver, Tommy Robinson, Fleckus Talks, and so many more.
[01:07:25.184 --> 01:07:27.044]  Right through, Saturday.
[01:07:28.686 --> 01:07:45.636]  And it's a focus on the attack on the First Amendment throughout the transmission, particularly during the evening, and codifying a political battle plan to counter the censorship and to beat the drums in Congress at the state level to counter that.
[01:07:45.636 --> 01:07:48.258]  And you've got attorney generals at the state level getting ready to take action.
[01:07:48.258 --> 01:07:49.739]  We'll play that next segment.
[01:07:49.739 --> 01:07:56.063]  You've got top generals saying China is working with Google, which we already know, but now it's coming out just how far the treason's gone.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.301]  It's amazing.
[01:08:00.301 --> 01:08:01.822]  But I want to play a report.
[01:08:01.822 --> 01:08:05.003]  Now this is like a 13-minute report.
[01:08:05.003 --> 01:08:07.924]  So we are going to play like seven, eight minutes of it and what's left of the segment.
[01:08:07.924 --> 01:08:10.565]  The full report's on Infowars.com.
[01:08:10.565 --> 01:08:17.308]  And seeing it's even more powerful, but radio listeners can hear it, our reporter, Caitlin Bennett, goes out.
[01:08:17.308 --> 01:08:21.110]  And this is not where she interviewed 100 people and then cherry-picked this.
[01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:24.791]  This is liberals, this is people at universities, this is libtards.
[01:08:24.791 --> 01:08:25.752]  And almost none of them
[01:08:27.079 --> 01:08:31.801]  Know who Robert Francis O'Rourke is, but they're Beto supporters.
[01:08:31.801 --> 01:08:41.145]  They don't know his father-in-law's worth 27 billion, or his wife's worth a billion, or they never worked a day in his life, or that he hit and run drunk driver, or that he's a psychotic who believes he's God.
[01:08:41.145 --> 01:08:43.406]  No.
[01:08:43.406 --> 01:08:47.468]  They just want to believe that, oh, this guy's big in the media, I just met him, I'm somebody.
[01:08:47.468 --> 01:08:48.829]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[01:08:49.804 --> 01:08:53.509]  So here's Caitlin Bennett talking to these poor millennials.
[01:08:53.509 --> 01:09:00.077]  And not all millennials are like this, but let me tell you, a large portion of them are zombie idiots with no drive, no sense of anything.
[01:09:00.077 --> 01:09:02.099]  They're just like TV heads.
[01:09:02.099 --> 01:09:03.261]  So here is the shocking truth.
[01:09:04.588 --> 01:09:07.930]  What do you think about Robert Francis O'Rourke running for president?
[01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:09.991]  I don't know Robert Francis, yeah.
[01:09:09.991 --> 01:09:10.431]  I don't know.
[01:09:10.431 --> 01:09:13.012]  So you guys have heard of Beto but not Robert?
[01:09:13.012 --> 01:09:14.954]  Yeah, Beto but not Robert.
[01:09:14.954 --> 01:09:23.778]  Well, Robert actually has been charged with a DUI, he's been arrested for burglary, and he has expressed desire to run over children with his car.
[01:09:23.778 --> 01:09:26.400]  That's just not a good desire to have, I don't think, yeah.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.140]  I don't know.
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.821]  Would you say that Robert's better than Beto?
[01:09:29.201 --> 01:09:29.881]  I don't know.
[01:09:29.881 --> 01:09:30.822]  I like Beto.
[01:09:30.822 --> 01:09:31.482]  I like Beto.
[01:09:31.482 --> 01:09:32.643]  But not Robert.
[01:09:32.643 --> 01:09:33.423]  Not Robert.
[01:09:33.423 --> 01:09:34.884]  From what I know.
[01:09:34.884 --> 01:09:35.884]  They're the same person.
[01:09:35.884 --> 01:09:37.765]  I just don't know enough information.
[01:09:37.765 --> 01:09:39.986]  They're the same person.
[01:09:39.986 --> 01:09:41.646]  They're the same person.
[01:09:41.646 --> 01:09:43.147]  She got me good.
[01:09:43.147 --> 01:09:47.989]  She got me good.
[01:09:47.989 --> 01:09:49.010]  We're back in St.
[01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:49.510]  Augustine.
[01:09:59.281 --> 01:10:08.051]  Robert Francis O'Rourke, an Irishman, has tried tricking low IQ Democrats into thinking he's a Hispanic by saying his name is now Beto.
[01:10:08.051 --> 01:10:10.313]  Let's see how many people actually fell for it.
[01:10:10.313 --> 01:10:13.096]  What do you guys think about Beto O'Rourke, who's running for president?
[01:10:13.096 --> 01:10:15.999]  I mean, he seems like a pretty chill dude.
[01:10:15.999 --> 01:10:17.101]  He's kind of nice too.
[01:10:17.101 --> 01:10:17.841]  So I don't...
[01:10:18.979 --> 01:10:23.220]  I mean, I'm generally, like, more Republican, but I think he seems pretty cool.
[01:10:23.220 --> 01:10:25.941]  I don't know much, but I know that he's a good guy.
[01:10:25.941 --> 01:10:26.681]  He's a good guy?
[01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:27.242]  Okay.
[01:10:27.242 --> 01:10:29.022]  He's like a family man, that's all I know.
[01:10:29.022 --> 01:10:30.162]  A family man.
[01:10:30.162 --> 01:10:30.823]  Perfect.
[01:10:30.823 --> 01:10:35.024]  Okay, so what do you guys think about Robert Francis O'Rourke, who's running for president?
[01:10:35.024 --> 01:10:36.364]  I don't know who that is.
[01:10:36.364 --> 01:10:37.625]  Neither do I. No clue.
[01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:42.906]  So, Robert is known for expressing desire to run over children with his car.
[01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:46.788]  He has been charged with a DUI, and he has been arrested for burglary.
[01:10:46.788 --> 01:10:47.788]  Do you think that's a family man?
[01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:49.812]  Definitely not, no.
[01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.613]  He sounds like a terrible person.
[01:10:51.613 --> 01:10:55.955]  What if I told you that Beto O'Rourke and Robert Francis O'Rourke are the same person?
[01:10:55.955 --> 01:10:57.916]  I knew you were going to say that.
[01:10:57.916 --> 01:10:59.337]  I knew it because of last night.
[01:10:59.337 --> 01:11:02.398]  Well, I guess that changes my mind on him.
[01:11:02.398 --> 01:11:05.480]  What do you think about Beto O'Rourke?
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.660]  I really like Beto.
[01:11:08.971 --> 01:11:13.473]  I think he's done a really good job of galvanizing his base, getting his message out.
[01:11:13.473 --> 01:11:21.277]  I think he's got a ways to go to get at some of the more established candidates, but I think he's got a lot of the enthusiasm.
[01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:26.119]  It's sort of reminiscent of Obama, the way he can whip up a crowd.
[01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:30.621]  What do you guys think about Robert Francis O'Rourke, who's running for president?
[01:11:30.621 --> 01:11:32.682]  I don't have a lot of exposure to him.
[01:11:32.682 --> 01:11:35.003]  I really like Beto.
[01:11:35.003 --> 01:11:37.444]  What do you think about Beto O'Rourke that's running?
[01:11:37.944 --> 01:11:53.779]  I feel like Beto O'Rourke is basically one of the best young Democrats running, and he has the most political power over what Trump discombobulated.
[01:11:56.545 --> 01:11:58.166]  system that he has.
[01:11:58.166 --> 01:12:06.931]  He speaks a lot of the truth, and he speaks to the people what they absolutely want at all times, and that's what I love about him.
[01:12:06.931 --> 01:12:09.593]  What's one of his policies that you like?
[01:12:09.593 --> 01:12:20.079]  Basically, just... What do you think about Robert Francis' work, who has decided to run for president as well?
[01:12:22.412 --> 01:12:25.718]  Yes, a good chance.
[01:12:25.718 --> 01:12:30.565]  He's very detailed on what the people need.
[01:12:30.565 --> 01:12:31.026]  What do you like?
[01:12:31.026 --> 01:12:32.068]  Who do you like more?
[01:12:32.068 --> 01:12:33.590]  Beto or Robert?
[01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:34.893]  Oh, Beto.
[01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:35.534]  All day.
[01:12:36.847 --> 01:12:50.079]  So something about Robert that I wanted to let you know and get people's opinions are, he actually has been charged with a DUI, he's been arrested for burglary, and he has expressed desire to run over children with a car.
[01:12:50.079 --> 01:12:53.022]  This has come out within the last few weeks.
[01:12:53.022 --> 01:12:56.085]  What do you think about that?
[01:12:56.085 --> 01:12:57.526]  Do you think that should disqualify him?
[01:13:00.948 --> 01:13:03.410]  Let me tell you who he was at that time.
[01:13:03.410 --> 01:13:05.051]  He was Beto O'Rourke.
[01:13:05.051 --> 01:13:06.012]  Those were the same people.
[01:13:23.228 --> 01:13:24.569]  Yeah, he really was.
[01:13:24.569 --> 01:13:25.690]  He really was.
[01:13:25.690 --> 01:13:26.671]  Those are the same people.
[01:13:26.671 --> 01:13:29.733]  Beto and Robert O'Rourke, those are the same people.
[01:13:29.733 --> 01:13:42.183]  What Robert did was he gave himself a nickname to sound more Hispanic because Beto is a nickname for the Hispanic name Roberto to try to garner Hispanic votes in Texas.
[01:13:42.183 --> 01:13:43.684]  Do you think that's inappropriate?
[01:13:43.684 --> 01:13:44.465]  It's very inappropriate.
[01:13:44.465 --> 01:13:47.287]  Does that change your mind on Beto a little bit?
[01:13:47.287 --> 01:13:50.590]  It changed my mind a lot because you shouldn't have to change who you are
[01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:55.883]  Do you know who Irishman Robert O'Rourke is?
[01:14:05.706 --> 01:14:07.067]  What do you think about Beto O'Rourke?
[01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:08.528]  Have you heard about him running?
[01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:14.871]  Yeah, I actually go to college in Oklahoma, so we sort of followed his race against Ted Cruz, like, earlier on.
[01:14:14.871 --> 01:14:18.793]  What do you think about Robert Francis O'Rourke, who's running for president?
[01:14:18.793 --> 01:14:21.154]  I haven't heard that he was running for president.
[01:14:21.154 --> 01:14:24.696]  Would you say Beto is a better candidate than Robert Francis O'Rourke?
[01:14:24.696 --> 01:14:24.956]  Easily.
[01:14:24.956 --> 01:14:26.777]  Easily.
[01:14:26.777 --> 01:14:28.258]  What if I told you those were the same person?
[01:14:31.318 --> 01:14:40.322]  Um, I guess I'd be kind of surprised because I wouldn't think anyone would even think he had a chance running against Ted Cruz just for the Senate seat.
[01:14:40.322 --> 01:14:43.203]  Yeah, so Robert Francis O'Rourke is Beto O'Rourke.
[01:14:43.203 --> 01:14:44.323]  He changed his name.
[01:14:44.323 --> 01:14:52.246]  He developed this nickname because in the Hispanic community, Beto is a nickname for the Hispanic name Roberto.
[01:14:52.246 --> 01:14:53.367]  And he wants to garner their votes.
[01:14:53.367 --> 01:14:54.387]  Okay, we're going to go to break.
[01:14:55.538 --> 01:14:57.920]  And we're going to come back with what should have been my top story.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.100]  I saw this this morning.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.501]  I meant it to be my top story.
[01:15:00.501 --> 01:15:10.188]  Speaking of Beto, because this is the future of the planet under these globalist brainwashing systems, if we let this continue.
[01:15:10.188 --> 01:15:16.032]  People think that Governor of Virginia just misspoke when he said we kill babies after they're born.
[01:15:16.032 --> 01:15:19.434]  No, he's a medical doctor that deals with that specifically.
[01:15:19.434 --> 01:15:21.736]  It's organ harvesting.
[01:15:21.736 --> 01:15:24.938]  But now Democrats everywhere are saying, no, no, no, we agree, kill babies after they're born.
[01:15:25.933 --> 01:15:33.839]  Well, after our own Millie Weaver brought it up a few days ago and became national news, it got picked up by Fox News, Ben Shapiro, you name it.
[01:15:33.839 --> 01:15:35.640]  A student asked Beto last night about it.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:42.865]  And he said, no, we kill them after their... I don't do a very good imitation, but... We do it for the mommies!
[01:15:42.865 --> 01:15:45.127]  Kill a baby for the mommies!
[01:15:45.127 --> 01:15:45.987]  Women!
[01:15:45.987 --> 01:15:46.868]  I like women!
[01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:49.847]  The baby can stay alive, but he's like, no!
[01:15:49.847 --> 01:15:50.067]  Kill!
[01:15:50.067 --> 01:15:52.448]  But it's out of the body, it's safe!
[01:15:52.448 --> 01:15:53.328]  No!
[01:15:53.328 --> 01:15:53.988]  Kill!
[01:15:53.988 --> 01:15:54.769]  Baby!
[01:15:54.769 --> 01:15:57.210]  I got big buck teeth, it's okay!
[01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:03.532]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:03.532 --> 01:16:06.573]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:06.573 --> 01:16:12.135]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:12.475 --> 01:16:16.278]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:16.278 --> 01:16:17.539]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:17.539 --> 01:16:18.540]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:25.084]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire, by James Dunn.
[01:16:25.084 --> 01:16:27.106]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:27.106 --> 01:16:28.987]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[01:16:28.987 --> 01:16:32.209]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:33.811]  Savory and delicious.
[01:16:33.811 --> 01:16:36.653]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:16:36.653 --> 01:16:37.053]  Awesome!
[01:16:37.313 --> 01:16:40.375]  No refrigeration needed with a 10-year shelf life.
[01:16:40.375 --> 01:16:41.956]  NASA PAC Technology.
[01:16:41.956 --> 01:16:42.577]  Bacon.
[01:16:42.577 --> 01:16:46.739]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon.
[01:16:46.739 --> 01:16:48.160]  Or warm and serve.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:50.222]  Life-saving, ready to eat bacon.
[01:16:50.222 --> 01:16:52.163]  10-year shelf life bacon.
[01:16:52.163 --> 01:16:54.945]  Ships free at FullyCookedBacon.com.

[01:16:57.335 --> 01:16:59.297]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.297 --> 01:17:04.602]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.602 --> 01:17:06.204]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.204 --> 01:17:14.552]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.552 --> 01:17:20.238]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:17:20.638 --> 01:17:22.219]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:17:22.219 --> 01:17:24.501]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:17:24.501 --> 01:17:28.904]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:17:28.904 --> 01:17:31.085]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:17:31.085 --> 01:17:38.951]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:17:39.051 --> 01:17:41.172]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:17:41.172 --> 01:17:44.114]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[01:17:44.114 --> 01:17:46.495]  And most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.124]  InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear of the Zeitgeist.
[01:18:09.124 --> 01:18:12.789]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:14.351]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:18:14.351 --> 01:18:20.920]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.703]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been!
[01:18:24.778 --> 01:18:28.119]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:18:28.119 --> 01:18:31.039]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:18:31.039 --> 01:18:32.740]  That sends chills up my spine.
[01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:46.282]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[01:18:46.282 --> 01:18:48.203]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[01:18:48.863 --> 01:18:54.133]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[01:18:54.133 --> 01:18:58.240]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.602]  I've got some really good news, though.
[01:19:00.732 --> 01:19:02.093]  X2's back.
[01:19:02.093 --> 01:19:03.853]  The original X2.
[01:19:03.853 --> 01:19:06.754]  Deep-earth crystal, pure atomic iodine.
[01:19:06.754 --> 01:19:07.855]  What you want.
[01:19:07.855 --> 01:19:08.975]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:08.975 --> 01:19:10.396]  It'll be here in a week.
[01:19:10.396 --> 01:19:11.956]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:12.937]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:12.937 --> 01:19:14.737]  With the best iodine in the world.
[01:19:14.737 --> 01:19:15.878]  X2, it's available.
[01:19:15.878 --> 01:19:16.858]  I thought X3's great.
[01:19:16.858 --> 01:19:19.059]  We still got another deep-earth crystal source.
[01:19:19.059 --> 01:19:20.880]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.240]  The scientists that do that.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:24.041]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[01:19:24.881 --> 01:19:29.243]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[01:19:29.243 --> 01:19:33.345]  We now have X2 again, and in fullmorestore.com, so hallelujah!
[01:19:33.345 --> 01:19:45.030]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:53.634]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,
[01:19:54.655 --> 01:20:04.437]  Get yours today at MFORESTORE.COM or MFORESTLIFE.COM You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:17.484]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[01:20:17.484 --> 01:20:25.908]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[01:20:25.908 --> 01:20:29.670]  How many did I adopt?
[01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:30.990]  I kill my kids!
[01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:32.251]  I kill my kids!
[01:20:36.838 --> 01:20:43.140]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[01:20:43.140 --> 01:20:45.121]  That's pretty cool, man.
[01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:48.902]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[01:20:48.902 --> 01:20:51.003]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.081]  I don't think so.
[01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:57.084]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[01:20:57.084 --> 01:20:58.005]  I pay for them.
[01:20:58.005 --> 01:21:01.388]  Good, how many have you paid for?
[01:21:01.388 --> 01:21:01.969]  Upwards of 50.
[01:21:01.969 --> 01:21:03.350]  Really?
[01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.690]  Oh yeah.
[01:21:13.686 --> 01:21:15.287]  You, you piece of s**t!
[01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.128]  Bunch of misogynist motherf**kers!
[01:21:17.128 --> 01:21:19.450]  Take your male privilege somewhere else!
[01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:21.591]  Tyler, you're being aggressive.
[01:21:21.591 --> 01:21:26.234]  I'm being aggressive?
[01:21:26.234 --> 01:21:37.902]  These, that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[01:21:37.902 --> 01:21:42.985]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:21:54.435 --> 01:22:12.945]  Governor Northam, a couple months ago, seems like a thousand years ago, was a medical doctor that's overseeing neonatal units and the harvesting, keeping the little buggers healthy and safe while we get all the little chitlins and livers out of them, all the little giblets.
[01:22:12.945 --> 01:22:14.366]  Very sick.
[01:22:14.366 --> 01:22:19.569]  Now they want to keep babies alive, but under bioethics they wave a magic wand.
[01:22:21.121 --> 01:22:25.986]  That's what replaced the Hippocratic Oath about 15 years ago all over Europe and the US.
[01:22:25.986 --> 01:22:28.308]  Now they wave a magic wand and two doctors.
[01:22:28.308 --> 01:22:31.391]  That constitutes a bioethics board now under federal and state law.
[01:22:31.391 --> 01:22:37.817]  They decide the baby isn't a human and isn't viable even though it's totally healthy.
[01:22:38.851 --> 01:22:43.354]  And if the mother decides to keep it, then they wave a wand and they call it resuscitation.
[01:22:43.354 --> 01:22:45.155]  That's actually a legal term.
[01:22:45.155 --> 01:22:46.416]  They're not actually resuscitating it.
[01:22:46.416 --> 01:22:48.578]  They're just now saying, okay, now it's alive.
[01:22:48.578 --> 01:22:51.300]  They're waving a wand and saying it's a human.
[01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:52.981]  Then the baby stays alive.
[01:22:52.981 --> 01:23:00.947]  But if they can trick mama, they can then take the tissue to a special wing where they keep the baby comfortable.
[01:23:01.818 --> 01:23:11.280]  Until they can get all the orders in in the next week or so for who wants a liver, who wants a kidney, who wants the different things that are needed, and they then render that baby down to nothing.
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.940]  And that's done all over Europe, all over China, all over the U.S.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:14.701]  now.
[01:23:14.701 --> 01:23:15.921]  And it's come out in federal court.
[01:23:15.921 --> 01:23:18.141]  So they've got a problem.
[01:23:18.141 --> 01:23:20.122]  Because it's coming out.
[01:23:20.122 --> 01:23:26.143]  See, before it was so horrible and so macabre and so nightmarish and just, you know, out of Crypt Keeper, no one could believe it.
[01:23:27.813 --> 01:23:33.398]  So no one would investigate because it was happening in plain view because no one could believe something that evil is happening.
[01:23:33.398 --> 01:23:34.899]  You understand how that works?
[01:23:34.899 --> 01:23:40.103]  But now because it's coming out, they've got to go, oh well of course we keep them alive.
[01:23:40.103 --> 01:23:42.405]  And so they've got five states set to pass laws.
[01:23:42.405 --> 01:23:45.308]  New York's passed a law where they keep babies alive.
[01:23:45.308 --> 01:23:48.610]  So Beano O'Rourke gets questioned two days ago by Millie Weaver.
[01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:49.611]  It goes viral.
[01:23:49.611 --> 01:23:50.432]  Tens of millions of views.
[01:23:50.432 --> 01:23:51.953]  It's all over Fox News.
[01:23:51.953 --> 01:23:52.674]  All over everything.
[01:23:52.674 --> 01:23:54.796]  Because he looks right at her and says,
[01:23:56.035 --> 01:24:01.437]  No, that's a woman's decision, even though the baby's already born, could live, out of the womb.
[01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:03.998]  That's actually changing former federal and state law.
[01:24:03.998 --> 01:24:06.860]  In fact, it runs against those laws.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:12.582]  There are abortionists who got caught keeping babies alive who were in prison, and they're trying to use the new laws to get out of prison.
[01:24:12.582 --> 01:24:14.583]  That's in my stack today.
[01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:19.105]  Well now, Beto refuses to support law to protect babies that survive abortion.
[01:24:20.865 --> 01:24:29.532]  There are a lot of famous people that have survived abortions, who Christian groups dug out of trash dumpsters back before they sold the parts.
[01:24:29.532 --> 01:24:32.114]  There are famous people that are on the top circuit.
[01:24:32.114 --> 01:24:33.395]  They speak at universities.
[01:24:33.395 --> 01:24:34.836]  We've had them on.
[01:24:34.836 --> 01:24:43.063]  Who survived eight, nine month abortions, had their skin burned off using the salt solution that makes the body abort.
[01:24:44.099 --> 01:24:50.411]  And it's not a medical procedure, it's not save the life of the mother procedure, because you would just cut the baby out if that was the case.
[01:24:50.411 --> 01:24:52.835]  They flame broil them with acid.
[01:24:53.777 --> 01:24:55.618]  I'm sorry this is so horrible to talk about.
[01:24:55.618 --> 01:24:56.558]  It's the reality.
[01:24:56.558 --> 01:24:59.259]  So there are living people in the U.S.
[01:24:59.259 --> 01:25:00.779]  who survived abortions.
[01:25:00.779 --> 01:25:02.199]  Not anymore.
[01:25:02.199 --> 01:25:03.920]  You can now be killed after you're born.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.840]  Then you can kill grandma when she's old.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.521]  So this is euthanasia.
[01:25:07.521 --> 01:25:08.941]  This is eugenics.
[01:25:08.941 --> 01:25:09.721]  This is pure death.
[01:25:09.721 --> 01:25:12.262]  So remember the governor when he said it.
[01:25:12.262 --> 01:25:13.642]  He wasn't slipping up.
[01:25:13.642 --> 01:25:15.383]  And pedo Rourke
[01:25:16.684 --> 01:25:19.147]  He doesn't just want to rape your kids, he wants them dead.
[01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:29.100]  Beto, Peto, whatever you want to call him, Beto O'Rourke, minion of the globalists, he now is doubling down and agreeing with the governor because this is their official policy.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:29.621]  Here's the governor.
[01:25:30.615 --> 01:25:36.980]  So in this particular example, if a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:50.491]  The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.
[01:25:50.491 --> 01:25:53.213]  So I think this was really blown out of proportion.
[01:25:53.793 --> 01:25:58.597]  But again, we want the government not to be involved in these types of decisions.
[01:25:58.597 --> 01:26:03.300]  We want the decision to be made by the mothers and their providers.
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.722]  And this is why... Okay, let's stop there.
[01:26:06.722 --> 01:26:13.587]  Of course the medical facilities don't want government and the standing laws that you can't kill babies after they're born in place.
[01:26:13.587 --> 01:26:16.909]  Because they've already got abortion, now they want post-birth abortion.
[01:26:16.909 --> 01:26:18.630]  And here's Beto O'Rourke.
[01:26:18.630 --> 01:26:20.051]  The story's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:26:21.741 --> 01:26:25.363]  Continuing to endorse this now official policy.
[01:26:25.363 --> 01:26:32.107]  The way I would approach your question and issue generally is to trust women to make their own decisions about their own bodies.
[01:26:32.107 --> 01:26:36.530]  No, it's the hospital coming in like ghouls to trick you.
[01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:38.211]  And hell, even a woman wants to kill her baby.
[01:26:38.211 --> 01:26:41.974]  Doesn't she want part of that $300,000 on average?
[01:26:41.974 --> 01:26:43.414]  See, that's why they really want me off air.
[01:26:43.414 --> 01:26:44.955]  Because a lot of these women don't care.
[01:26:44.955 --> 01:26:47.137]  What about that cash value?
[01:26:48.257 --> 01:26:50.520]  That'll get some of these demon women upset.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:55.204]  They're gonna be like, I want some money off that liver, off my baby I killed.
[01:26:55.204 --> 01:26:58.808]  We get the Satanists fighting with each other and let the women know the price.
[01:26:58.808 --> 01:27:02.652]  It'll drive the price up and we may actually get this stuff outlawed.
[01:27:02.652 --> 01:27:03.573]  I know I'm an extremist.
[01:27:03.573 --> 01:27:05.795]  I know I'm saying don't kill babies after they're born.
[01:27:05.795 --> 01:27:06.296]  Here's the clip.
[01:27:07.711 --> 01:27:12.672]  I wanted to ask you about a recent bill that just went through the Senate about two weeks ago.
[01:27:12.672 --> 01:27:29.717]  And the bill was that if an abortion was performed on a viable fetus and the fetus survived the abortion, the doctor would then be compelled to give that living baby the same care as any other pregnancy baby that came out and put that baby through the care.
[01:27:29.717 --> 01:27:34.899]  Would you support this bill that does not in any way limit abortion and simply seeks
[01:27:35.559 --> 01:27:38.803]  To keep babies alive that have been born alive.
[01:27:38.803 --> 01:27:44.669]  Thank you for the question.
[01:27:44.669 --> 01:27:54.219]  The way that I would approach your question and this issue generally is to trust women to make their own decisions about their own bodies.
[01:27:54.219 --> 01:27:55.981]  Yay!
[01:27:55.981 --> 01:27:57.883]  Kill that baby out, it's on the table alive.
[01:27:59.323 --> 01:28:02.266]  The universe has learned to give you high quality health care for everyone in this country.
[01:28:02.266 --> 01:28:03.888]  It's primary health care.
[01:28:03.888 --> 01:28:05.069]  It's mental health care.
[01:28:05.069 --> 01:28:05.989]  Oh, that's enough.
[01:28:05.989 --> 01:28:08.612]  So see how they move the goalpost.
[01:28:08.612 --> 01:28:09.893]  First, it's not a human.
[01:28:09.893 --> 01:28:13.176]  Then it's, well, it's a human, but the mother can kill it after it's born.
[01:28:13.176 --> 01:28:22.284]  Okay, five minutes after, a week after, a month after, a year after, Peter Singer, who's the intellectual head of PETA, he says kill kids up to age three.
[01:28:22.284 --> 01:28:25.507]  And let bioethics boards decide if somebody's got value in their life.
[01:28:26.263 --> 01:28:27.968]  And whether you're human or not.
[01:28:27.968 --> 01:28:28.951]  And you just heard him.
[01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:32.060]  We'll keep him comfortable, and then we'll decide whether to resuscitate.
[01:28:32.847 --> 01:28:34.947]  We'll decide whether to say this is a living person or not.
[01:28:34.947 --> 01:28:40.729]  And we're just gonna sit here and take it while they mainline and the women are like, woo!
[01:28:40.729 --> 01:28:42.209]  Woo!
[01:28:42.209 --> 01:28:44.769]  Kill that baby after it's born!
[01:28:44.769 --> 01:28:52.051]  And if it survives, give it Ritalin, give it Prozac, give it deadly vaccines, and then let big, fat drag queens have the kids sit on their lap.
[01:28:52.051 --> 01:28:54.591]  Because if we can't kill them, better just rape them!
[01:28:54.591 --> 01:28:56.832]  That's even better, to torture them and rape them!
[01:28:56.832 --> 01:28:57.472]  Panophilia!
[01:28:57.472 --> 01:28:58.452]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.672 --> 01:29:02.595]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.595 --> 01:29:04.136]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.136 --> 01:29:07.099]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.099 --> 01:29:12.663]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[01:33:01.275 --> 01:33:03.956]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:09.209 --> 01:33:19.877]  So, what do you make of Beto O'Rourke adopting the official new party platform, the Democratic Party?
[01:33:37.369 --> 01:33:40.452]  To kill babies after they're born and are totally viable.
[01:33:40.452 --> 01:33:52.582]  They don't tell women that there are hundreds of charities, the biggest one's Catholic, that will get a woman a job and pay her up to $100,000 to have the baby and have a place for adoption.
[01:33:52.582 --> 01:33:56.426]  There are other high-end ones where some women get up to $300,000.
[01:33:56.426 --> 01:34:01.250]  That's just in the process themselves.
[01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:03.292]  So women don't get told, hey, by the way,
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.761]  And I'm talking about Hispanic women, black women, white women, you name it.
[01:34:07.761 --> 01:34:10.882]  You can get paid to not abort your baby.
[01:34:10.882 --> 01:34:12.202]  No one knows that.
[01:34:12.202 --> 01:34:14.442]  There's some billboards up here and there.
[01:34:14.442 --> 01:34:21.724]  People don't know that there are more people wanting to adopt each year than there are babies aborted.
[01:34:21.724 --> 01:34:26.766]  That's why people have to go to Russia or South Korea to get babies or China.
[01:34:26.766 --> 01:34:27.306]  It's incredible.
[01:34:28.570 --> 01:34:41.136]  It's absolutely incredible that this is going on, and they won't tell the women, and they won't tell the women, by the way, they're selling your baby's organs when they're third trimester or now post-birth abortion.
[01:34:41.136 --> 01:34:50.480]  Because again, all these hospitals sell the blood, sell the tissue, and it's put into cosmetics and other products.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:54.122]  But if they can keep them alive, folks, they get a lot of money.
[01:34:54.122 --> 01:34:57.023]  But again, they consider them dead tissue.
[01:34:58.035 --> 01:35:03.559]  They wave a wand, check a box, and say, resuscitated, the baby lives.
[01:35:03.559 --> 01:35:04.861]  But the baby's alive.
[01:35:04.861 --> 01:35:07.863]  It's all semantical games.
[01:35:07.863 --> 01:35:09.524]  And this is all bioethics.
[01:35:09.524 --> 01:35:10.965]  This is how they think they get away with it.
[01:35:10.965 --> 01:35:17.391]  That's why the governor of Virginia keeps saying, we don't want the police involved, we don't want Congress involved, we don't want government involved.
[01:35:17.391 --> 01:35:20.493]  No, this is the woman and her doctors.
[01:35:20.493 --> 01:35:23.135]  Because they're encroaching on law.
[01:35:23.135 --> 01:35:23.596]  Why not?
[01:35:23.596 --> 01:35:25.257]  They already can kill babies before they're born.
[01:35:25.257 --> 01:35:26.198]  Why not kill them after?
[01:35:27.898 --> 01:35:30.879]  And then the women are like, woo!
[01:35:30.879 --> 01:35:34.900]  I got a new right to kill babies after they're born.
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:41.581]  But if you tell these witches, hey, you could get a lot of money for adopting the baby, they'd do it.
[01:35:41.581 --> 01:35:52.004]  Or if you tell these leftist witches, hey, you know, when they gut your son or daughter, you could get half that money, a couple hundred thou.
[01:35:52.004 --> 01:35:57.565]  But you see, and it's so immoral, though, that once people find out that women are having kids to have them gutted, it'll get outlawed.
[01:35:58.479 --> 01:36:01.600]  Let me tell you, these women, they'll gut their kids all day.
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:05.921]  Boy, you don't think the average leftist woman wouldn't have a baby to get $300,000?
[01:36:05.921 --> 01:36:09.662]  She'd probably sit there and piss on her kid while they were getting their guts chopped out.
[01:36:09.662 --> 01:36:10.262]  I'm serious.
[01:36:10.262 --> 01:36:11.982]  These people love evil.
[01:36:11.982 --> 01:36:18.724]  You want me to play you a bunch of clips around the country of leftist women going, I love Satan, I love the devil, I love killing my kids, hail Satan.
[01:36:19.622 --> 01:36:22.483]  You gotta understand, they hate you and your family.
[01:36:22.483 --> 01:36:23.724]  They hate God.
[01:36:23.724 --> 01:36:24.985]  They hate this country.
[01:36:24.985 --> 01:36:25.965]  They hate life.
[01:36:25.965 --> 01:36:30.007]  They're turned over to the devil, just like the Bible says.
[01:36:30.007 --> 01:36:36.930]  And the sooner you figure that out, the sooner they'll stop ruling us and hurting our children.
[01:36:36.930 --> 01:36:37.850]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:38.671]  I never gave the number out.
[01:36:39.707 --> 01:36:51.075]  To the chagrin of the producers and folks in there, but we're going to take your calls through this hour and the next hour, because Tom Pappert is a great TV station manager where he carries our show, but also a talk show host in his own right.
[01:36:51.075 --> 01:36:51.956]  And so he's going to be joining us.
[01:36:51.956 --> 01:36:52.876]  He'll be happy to take calls.
[01:36:52.876 --> 01:36:56.459]  I want to hear from you on Beto.
[01:36:56.459 --> 01:37:06.026]  You know, I don't wish any harm against Beto O'Rourke or against the governor of Virginia, but imagine if somebody, God forbid, just hypothetically grabbed him.
[01:37:08.058 --> 01:37:10.319]  And they're all chained down in a warehouse somewhere.
[01:37:10.319 --> 01:37:13.580]  And it's a medical doctor that kidnapped them.
[01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:16.061]  And the medical doctor has another medical doctor and he goes, well, there's two of us.
[01:37:16.061 --> 01:37:18.121]  We're a bioethics board, like the governor said.
[01:37:18.121 --> 01:37:20.242]  And we decided you're not alive.
[01:37:20.242 --> 01:37:21.582]  You're a ball of flesh.
[01:37:21.582 --> 01:37:26.324]  So we're going to start harvesting your kidneys and stuff while you're awake and let you watch it.
[01:37:27.944 --> 01:37:32.066]  And while you beg for your life, we go, man, this corpse is talking a lot.
[01:37:32.066 --> 01:37:35.448]  Oh, could we put your kidneys back in you and let you go?
[01:37:35.448 --> 01:37:37.889]  Wave a wand, you're resuscitated, governor.
[01:37:37.889 --> 01:37:40.010]  You can survive.
[01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:41.570]  People are like, whoa, that's really extreme.
[01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:46.853]  Talk about the governor being gutted by two doctors in a basement or a warehouse.
[01:37:46.853 --> 01:37:48.934]  But see, that's a baby.
[01:37:48.934 --> 01:37:50.615]  It can't walk, it can't defend itself.
[01:37:50.615 --> 01:37:53.516]  It's just like, yeah, kill that bugger.
[01:37:53.516 --> 01:37:55.277]  Jones is out of control.
[01:37:56.656 --> 01:38:02.517]  Because the truth is so horrible, you'd go crazy like me if you cared.
[01:38:02.517 --> 01:38:04.098]  And I'm not talking to our average listener.
[01:38:04.098 --> 01:38:13.299]  I'm talking to the folks that listen to NPR and the establishment types and all the wannabe tough guy liberal lawyers and all you people who say you have the moral high ground.
[01:38:13.299 --> 01:38:14.700]  You have no moral high ground.
[01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:25.362]  You're a bunch of wicked, evil, race-division-pushing control freaks, bought and paid for by the most evil corporations in the world to bring in the end of the human age.
[01:38:26.795 --> 01:38:27.915]  And guess what, Jack?
[01:38:27.915 --> 01:38:28.375]  You failed.
[01:38:28.375 --> 01:38:29.696]  It ain't gonna work.
[01:38:29.696 --> 01:38:40.339]  So, the toll-free number to join us on any of the issues we raised, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:38:40.339 --> 01:38:53.202]  You imagine, God forbid, because I'm a non-violent guy, if somebody grabbed the governor of Virginia and took him, and then while he was awake, chained down, cut his organs out like they do these babies, and asked him how he liked it.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:59.902]  I wonder if he'd say, well, keep me comfortable.
[01:38:59.902 --> 01:39:01.282]  Well, we'll keep you comfortable, alright.
[01:39:01.282 --> 01:39:07.305]  I mean, how would he like it if they took power drills to his knees?
[01:39:07.305 --> 01:39:10.566]  Power drills, you know, because these are babies you're doing this to.
[01:39:10.566 --> 01:39:12.187]  You're chopping them up.
[01:39:12.187 --> 01:39:17.550]  But, oh, because you got that fake Southern accent, it's okay.
[01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:18.730]  All an act.
[01:39:18.730 --> 01:39:19.450]  I love the South.
[01:39:19.450 --> 01:39:20.771]  Good people there.
[01:39:20.771 --> 01:39:22.712]  Texas is kind of the gateway to the South, either way.
[01:39:24.963 --> 01:39:35.594]  But there's a fake type of Southerner that has these real sweet little voices and it's all about scamming the common people and keeping everybody in line.
[01:39:35.594 --> 01:39:45.483]  Let me tell you something, in the South, East Texas, it's the South, people that talk like that, you don't want to trust them, alright?
[01:39:45.483 --> 01:39:46.865]  He's a piece of filth.
[01:39:48.217 --> 01:39:50.139]  And all I want is the babies protected.
[01:39:50.139 --> 01:39:57.566]  But imagine how taboo it is to hear me talk about people kidnapping and torturing to death a governor, which I don't want to happen.
[01:39:57.566 --> 01:39:59.628]  But see, we talk about killing babies all day after they're born.
[01:39:59.628 --> 01:40:02.131]  It's like, okay, because we already set the precedent.
[01:40:02.131 --> 01:40:07.256]  They are like steak on the table.
[01:40:07.256 --> 01:40:08.778]  They're like a can of baked beans.
[01:40:08.778 --> 01:40:09.819]  They don't have any rights.
[01:40:12.011 --> 01:40:20.977]  And then you've got this guy that talks like Foghorn Leghorn out there pushing this to the whole world, and he wants us to forget that.
[01:40:20.977 --> 01:40:21.557]  Makes me sick.
[01:40:21.557 --> 01:40:22.738]  We're going to go to break.
[01:40:22.738 --> 01:40:26.401]  Listen, we've got specials every hour.
[01:40:26.401 --> 01:40:35.687]  And the special last hour, as soon as this hour, is 55% off all the great X2 iodine that we've got back in stock, by the grace of God, and Super Mel Vitality.
[01:40:35.687 --> 01:40:37.048]  Those are the two specials.
[01:40:37.048 --> 01:40:37.888]  And then they'll go back to 50% off.
[01:40:39.414 --> 01:40:42.536]  Here in the next few hours, and then we'll have new things at 55% off.
[01:40:42.536 --> 01:40:43.917]  But everything's 50% off.
[01:40:43.917 --> 01:40:48.440]  It's a supplement and double Patriot points and free shipping.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.741]  Storewide.
[01:40:50.741 --> 01:40:52.983]  But X2, 98% approval rating.
[01:40:52.983 --> 01:40:53.463]  Incredible.
[01:40:53.463 --> 01:40:54.724]  Just experience it for yourself, folks.
[01:40:54.724 --> 01:40:55.605]  The good halogen.
[01:40:55.605 --> 01:40:56.465]  Find out all about it.
[01:40:56.465 --> 01:40:57.586]  Go read about it.
[01:40:57.586 --> 01:40:59.327]  It's $17.95 right now.
[01:40:59.327 --> 01:41:00.148]  It's an incredible deal.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:10.822]  55% off and you fund an operation where we get up here and fight the pedophiles and fight people openly saying we're going to kill babies after they're born and sell their goodies.
[01:41:10.822 --> 01:41:13.083]  Because they want their goodies.
[01:41:13.083 --> 01:41:16.444]  Hell, I mean the pedophiles, I guess, just rape the kids.
[01:41:16.444 --> 01:41:19.965]  These folks want to kill them better than a hammer and sell their goods.
[01:41:19.965 --> 01:41:20.925]  Sell their innards.
[01:41:20.925 --> 01:41:23.386]  Sell what the womb God created made.
[01:41:23.386 --> 01:41:26.887]  And they just think we're going to take it.
[01:41:26.887 --> 01:41:28.167]  Well, some of us aren't going to take it.
[01:41:30.154 --> 01:41:42.380]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, humanize these babies and give them at least as much value as the governor, who, when he's not wearing a KKK outfit, is in blackface.
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:43.041]  Totally evil.
[01:41:43.041 --> 01:41:45.602]  These innocent little children suffer little children under me.
[01:41:45.602 --> 01:41:51.085]  Better for someone to throw themselves in the deepest ocean with a giant stone hung around their neck, a millstone, than to hurt one of these.
[01:41:51.085 --> 01:41:52.105]  Think about that.
[01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:53.526]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:41:53.526 --> 01:41:55.027]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:41:55.027 --> 01:41:56.307]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:41:56.307 --> 01:41:57.048]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:41:59.197 --> 01:42:06.483]  50% off all the supplements, a bunch of other big deals, but every hour a new special, 55% off on that particular special.
[01:42:06.483 --> 01:42:09.806]  Oh, the left tells you they care about kids in school shootings, turn your guns in.
[01:42:09.806 --> 01:42:16.391]  Oh, they tell you they care about all these things, but they love the Arab Spring murdering millions, and they love killing babies after they're born.
[01:42:16.391 --> 01:42:17.792]  They're monsters.
[01:42:17.792 --> 01:42:25.699]  In national and international studies, nine times more likely to virtue signal and tell you they're giving to charity, but not to.
[01:42:25.699 --> 01:42:27.140]  Six times more likely to steal.
[01:42:28.379 --> 01:42:30.020]  In every study.
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:30.920]  They're scum.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.621]  They're filth.
[01:42:31.621 --> 01:42:32.681]  They're liars.
[01:42:32.681 --> 01:42:33.842]  They want the moral authority.
[01:42:33.842 --> 01:42:41.145]  They want you, who has a conscience, to feel bad when they tell you you're bad, because they have nothing but controlling you.
[01:42:41.145 --> 01:42:44.847]  They have nothing but butchering babies and sucking out their livers.
[01:42:44.847 --> 01:42:45.728]  Or raping them.
[01:42:45.728 --> 01:42:46.968]  It's their religion.
[01:42:46.968 --> 01:42:53.872]  If they can't brain damage them, or rape them, or get their livers, they'll give them fluoride, and they'll annihilate them with vaccines.
[01:42:53.872 --> 01:42:55.492]  It's all about murdering us.
[01:42:55.492 --> 01:42:56.253]  It's their religion!
[01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:05.326]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[01:43:05.326 --> 01:43:08.669]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:11.771]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[01:43:11.771 --> 01:43:13.312]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:43:13.312 --> 01:43:19.877]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:43:19.877 --> 01:43:22.680]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:43:23.735 --> 01:43:27.076]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[01:43:27.076 --> 01:43:29.997]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night.
[01:43:29.997 --> 01:43:31.697]  That sends chills up my spine.
[01:43:31.697 --> 01:43:45.241]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.

[01:44:02.405 --> 01:44:05.325]  So far, it matches any other special we've ever done.
[01:44:05.325 --> 01:44:07.946]  So this is the best deal we've ever offered.
[01:44:07.946 --> 01:44:09.546]  Free shipping storewide.

[01:44:11.407 --> 01:44:12.587]  Free shipping storewide.
[01:44:13.628 --> 01:44:14.808]  50% off all the supplements.
[01:44:14.808 --> 01:44:17.010]  A bunch of other great deals as well.
[01:44:17.010 --> 01:44:18.091]  Double Patriot Points.
[01:44:18.091 --> 01:44:19.952]  A set of 5% on each order.

[01:44:31.121 --> 01:44:37.163]  You add that to 50% off and storewide free shipping, most of these products are lost leaders.
[01:44:37.163 --> 01:44:39.084]  So I want to thank you all for supporting the InfoWar.
[01:44:39.084 --> 01:44:44.066]  I want to encourage you today to get great products at 360Win and InfoWarStore.com.

[01:44:45.206 --> 01:44:46.426]  Voting with our dollars.
[01:44:46.426 --> 01:44:47.667]  Voting with our mouths.
[01:44:47.667 --> 01:44:49.147]  Voting with our speech.
[01:44:49.147 --> 01:44:50.448]  Voting with our action.
[01:44:50.448 --> 01:44:52.008]  Free shipping storewide.
[01:44:52.008 --> 01:44:53.889]  That's free shipping storewide.
[01:44:53.889 --> 01:44:56.230]  Free shipping storewide at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:44:58.334 --> 01:45:02.998]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[01:45:02.998 --> 01:45:07.241]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[01:45:07.241 --> 01:45:15.187]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[01:45:15.187 --> 01:45:18.310]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:21.793]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[01:45:23.119 --> 01:45:26.243]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[01:45:26.243 --> 01:45:28.285]  We are the power structure.
[01:45:28.285 --> 01:45:29.886]  We are the inventors.
[01:45:29.886 --> 01:45:31.668]  We are the trailblazers.
[01:45:31.668 --> 01:45:35.072]  And the globalists understand that.
[01:45:35.072 --> 01:45:42.179]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[01:45:42.179 --> 01:45:46.003]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:58.806]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[01:45:58.806 --> 01:46:04.808]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[01:46:04.808 --> 01:46:07.750]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:11.812]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.
[01:46:11.812 --> 01:46:12.312]  I'm one of the top
[01:46:13.382 --> 01:46:14.743]  Most respected companies out there.
[01:46:14.743 --> 01:46:22.507]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:22.507 --> 01:46:27.869]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[01:46:27.869 --> 01:46:30.131]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[01:46:30.131 --> 01:46:33.652]  InfoWareStore.com on InfoWare Select storable foods.
[01:46:33.652 --> 01:46:35.133]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:46:35.133 --> 01:46:39.135]  They've got three-month supplies, year's supplies, and week emergency supplies.
[01:46:39.135 --> 01:46:41.336]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:46:41.336 --> 01:46:42.417]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[01:46:42.897 --> 01:46:44.858]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.858 --> 01:46:47.378]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:47.378 --> 01:46:52.400]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.

[01:47:01.302 --> 01:47:03.943]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.466 --> 01:47:23.892]  You know, if you just tuned in, I guarantee you the corporate mainstream media is going to take what I said last segment and lie about it.
[01:47:23.892 --> 01:47:26.694]  People say, well, then you shouldn't say things they can twist.
[01:47:26.694 --> 01:47:28.356]  No.
[01:47:28.356 --> 01:47:34.681]  It's like saying you shouldn't have children because people like Governor Northam out there that want to kill them or we should just give up.
[01:47:34.681 --> 01:47:36.903]  I said I wish no harm upon the governor.
[01:47:37.742 --> 01:48:00.913]  But I said hypothetically, which I hope never happens, if two medical doctors grabbed him that were bioethicists, and they decided he wasn't really viable or alive, that's what they do to these already born babies in the bioethics game, and then he's sitting there talking while he's chained down to a table, having his organs harvested, starting with his kidneys, begging for his life, and they're saying, shut up, bag of guts!
[01:48:00.913 --> 01:48:02.214]  I haven't resuscitated you!
[01:48:02.214 --> 01:48:03.534]  I've decided you're not alive!
[01:48:03.534 --> 01:48:04.455]  I've dehumanized you!
[01:48:05.663 --> 01:48:07.064]  You hear that and it sounds sick.
[01:48:07.064 --> 01:48:08.886]  It sounds like Silence of the Lambs.
[01:48:08.886 --> 01:48:09.827]  It sounds horrible.
[01:48:09.827 --> 01:48:10.968]  It sounds indefensible.
[01:48:10.968 --> 01:48:12.590]  Because it is!
[01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:16.534]  Just like killing already born babies are!
[01:48:16.534 --> 01:48:20.518]  But I just showed you Beto O'Rourke endorsing it.
[01:48:20.518 --> 01:48:27.024]  Because they've been caught in Texas and California and New York and Virginia keeping babies alive.
[01:48:27.024 --> 01:48:28.906]  And the nurses will follow a lot of orders, folks.
[01:48:31.527 --> 01:48:33.330]  But this whole thing, and we're going to decide.
[01:48:33.330 --> 01:48:36.635]  The mother's not sure if she wants to keep the baby.
[01:48:36.635 --> 01:48:39.038]  And then they're getting them set up to have their organs harvested.
[01:48:39.038 --> 01:48:39.920]  And the nurses know that.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.001]  We've had nurses on.
[01:48:41.001 --> 01:48:46.249]  And it's been in the news that when they give the babies the shots that are in the neonicu area.
[01:48:47.068 --> 01:48:55.819]  For the preemies, that they get respirators ready because they're ordered to give them shots, even though until five years ago you didn't give premature kids shots, it can kill them.
[01:48:55.819 --> 01:49:02.447]  And now up to half of them start dying and they got to put them on respirators and then keep them alive and then the doctors walk in and go, hold on now.
[01:49:05.885 --> 01:49:08.806]  It's all eugenics getting rid of the infirm.
[01:49:08.806 --> 01:49:18.510]  They're practicing it in the hospitals to get nurses used to killing babies with vaccines so that when they harvest organs, the nurses don't understand what's happening.
[01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:23.312]  It's all about maneuvering you by successive approximation to see what you'll do.
[01:49:23.312 --> 01:49:26.033]  How many things have I told you turn out to be going on?
[01:49:26.753 --> 01:49:30.756]  I've been telling you 20 plus years they're taking babies' organs.
[01:49:30.756 --> 01:49:32.398]  Now it's all over the news.
[01:49:32.398 --> 01:49:36.321]  That's why Northam is on television trying to mainline it.
[01:49:36.321 --> 01:49:40.824]  That's why Beto's doing that.
[01:49:40.824 --> 01:49:43.446]  Beto O'Rourke.
[01:49:43.446 --> 01:49:44.627]  Beyond Beto.
[01:49:44.627 --> 01:49:46.889]  Wants to kill kids.
[01:49:46.889 --> 01:49:52.093]  And it's hiding in plain view, just like... I'm on Joe Rubin's podcast.
[01:49:52.093 --> 01:49:53.274]  And Joe's really smart and well-read.
[01:49:53.274 --> 01:49:54.976]  He always goes kind of with the official story.
[01:49:56.013 --> 01:49:57.194]  Well, at first.
[01:49:57.194 --> 01:50:19.830]  And I'm saying, and here and in the black areas of Alabama and in West Virginia and Kentucky with poor whites and with Native Americans in Arizona and in New Mexico and, you know, in Peru, our government for 40 plus years injected people with live syphilis so they'd spread it and kill hundreds of thousands.
[01:50:20.503 --> 01:50:21.663]  That's a criminal element.
[01:50:21.663 --> 01:50:25.185]  And Joe goes, wait a minute, we knew they had it and let them spread it.
[01:50:25.185 --> 01:50:25.865]  No.
[01:50:25.865 --> 01:50:26.985]  Joe search engine-ed it.
[01:50:26.985 --> 01:50:31.427]  NBC had to admit.
[01:50:31.427 --> 01:50:38.569]  That's because I actually read the Tuskegee reports that came out in Congress in the mid-80s.
[01:50:38.569 --> 01:50:41.450]  Versus what news would say.
[01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.971]  You understand?
[01:50:41.971 --> 01:50:44.452]  So when you go to the CDC, you get the whitewash.
[01:50:44.452 --> 01:50:45.832]  But we have the congressional record.
[01:50:45.832 --> 01:50:47.353]  I'm going to say it again.
[01:50:47.353 --> 01:50:48.193]  But notice what they did.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:51.281]  If you understand this, you understand everything.
[01:50:51.281 --> 01:50:59.248]  You see, with the left, there's an elitism that they're healthy, they're whatever, they'll decide to kill grandma, they'll decide to kill a baby, they're in charge.
[01:50:59.248 --> 01:51:00.109]  And it's the same thing.
[01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:08.155]  Well, when it came out, criminal elements of the CDC have been injecting people from Pakistan to Peru to the U.S.
[01:51:08.155 --> 01:51:08.656]  with live
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:13.761]  Syphilis and, by the way, polio was also part of another program.
[01:51:13.761 --> 01:51:14.241]  What are we going to do?
[01:51:14.241 --> 01:51:24.284]  They go, contain it, say it was rural blacks, that'll feed into the whole guilt thing and that whites are racist, don't let them know the full picture of the eugenics, and just isolate it to Alabama.
[01:51:24.284 --> 01:51:25.044]  And it worked perfectly.
[01:51:25.044 --> 01:51:29.426]  They isolated it just to Alabama, which was terrible and wrong.
[01:51:29.426 --> 01:51:34.967]  Tens of thousands of blacks given syphilis, hundreds of thousands got it, horrible, long, excruciating deaths.
[01:51:34.967 --> 01:51:40.249]  Syphilis is microscopic worms that literally eat your brain and other organs.
[01:51:42.342 --> 01:51:44.143]  And there's no cure, still.
[01:51:44.143 --> 01:51:46.945]  There's treatments.
[01:51:46.945 --> 01:51:49.807]  You have to understand, ladies and gentlemen, these people mean business.
[01:51:49.807 --> 01:51:55.531]  And why they're obsessed with syphilis, we're not sure, but it may be a carrier for a binary weapon.
[01:51:55.531 --> 01:52:05.217]  Because it was German scientists they brought over at the end of World War II at Plum Island off the shore of New York, this is all declassified, who created Lyme disease, a weaponized syphilis.
[01:52:05.217 --> 01:52:06.138]  Lyme disease is syphilis.
[01:52:07.071 --> 01:52:09.812]  Carried in the tick.
[01:52:09.812 --> 01:52:21.895]  And I have a family member who was rock climbing, super healthy, at 50-something, got Lyme's disease on a hunting trip in East Texas, and had never recovered.
[01:52:21.895 --> 01:52:28.618]  And I have another friend who it ate part of his spine, you name it, from a tick.
[01:52:28.618 --> 01:52:32.779]  Now, what I'm telling you is, folks, is that they're hitting us with syphilis.
[01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:36.440]  And so, but, oh, just don't worry, it's just those black people.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:36.840]  Yeah, right.
[01:52:38.305 --> 01:52:43.530]  That's why we all gotta know we're in this together when they push this racism crap and this divide and conquer.
[01:52:43.530 --> 01:52:46.813]  Doesn't mean we don't expose racist blacks or Hispanics or whites or anybody that are being like that.
[01:52:46.813 --> 01:52:49.475]  It doesn't mean we buy into also being guilt-ridden about it.
[01:52:49.475 --> 01:52:59.044]  We point out the real globalist racist social engineer program is what's attacking us and what is out of control and what has to be dealt with.
[01:52:59.044 --> 01:53:01.727]  So don't believe me, look up Tuskegee.
[01:53:01.727 --> 01:53:03.949]  Look up that they gave it to people on purpose.
[01:53:05.239 --> 01:53:07.842]  Look up the atomic soldiers.
[01:53:07.842 --> 01:53:09.865]  Look it up and grow up.
[01:53:09.865 --> 01:53:17.474]  I don't mean our general audience, but new listeners.
[01:53:17.474 --> 01:53:20.657]  The UN has an insatiable appetite for children.
[01:53:21.462 --> 01:53:23.482]  You think I'm just obsessed on children, children, children?
[01:53:23.482 --> 01:53:30.884]  When you pull back and you look at this new world order, man, it's got one thing on its mind, and it's killing, raping, diseasing, and hurting children.
[01:53:30.884 --> 01:53:33.465]  Well, what the hell do you think the devil wants to do?
[01:53:33.465 --> 01:53:37.366]  What do all the ancient legends tell us about the elites?
[01:53:37.366 --> 01:53:40.526]  They're not the elites, they are demons!
[01:53:40.526 --> 01:53:44.427]  Whether you believe in the devil and God, or demons or angels, it doesn't matter, they believe in you!
[01:53:44.427 --> 01:53:47.788]  And they've got a hunger!
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:50.420]  That's unquenchable!
[01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:57.904]  And they're not going to live in peace with us until we deal with them!
[01:53:57.904 --> 01:54:11.631]  So again, I illustrate the absurdity of killing already-born babies with what if somebody, God forbid, nobody should do this, grabbed the god-like governor and told him while he's chained down, you're not alive because I'm a bioethics doctor like you.
[01:54:13.752 --> 01:54:15.392]  And the state shouldn't be involved in this.
[01:54:15.392 --> 01:54:21.514]  I say you're not alive, and I'm going to take power drills to your kneecaps right now, and then I'm going to cut your guts out right in front of you.
[01:54:21.514 --> 01:54:22.414]  No, please don't do it.
[01:54:22.414 --> 01:54:23.274]  God, why are you doing this?
[01:54:23.274 --> 01:54:23.814]  I'm a human being.
[01:54:23.814 --> 01:54:24.474]  This is murder.
[01:54:24.474 --> 01:54:25.254]  No, it's not!
[01:54:25.254 --> 01:54:29.135]  I said you're not alive, scumbag!
[01:54:29.135 --> 01:54:30.155]  So I'm not killing anybody.
[01:54:30.155 --> 01:54:32.936]  Now, see, I'd never do that.
[01:54:32.936 --> 01:54:40.238]  That sounds outrageous, though, doesn't it, as the illustration of what he's saying on TV, Paduda Babies, what Beto O'Rourke is saying.
[01:54:40.238 --> 01:54:42.018]  These people are monsters!
[01:54:43.404 --> 01:54:45.326]  They're not clear in present danger.
[01:54:45.326 --> 01:54:48.689]  They're acting attacks on our children.
[01:54:48.689 --> 01:54:53.814]  They're a psycho cult pushing what they can get away with on us.
[01:54:53.814 --> 01:54:56.756]  All those undercover videos.
[01:54:56.756 --> 01:55:04.644]  The pro-lifer shot of people drinking $200 bottle wine, talking about how they're making millions a year and going, I'm looking at a yellow Lamborghini.
[01:55:08.686 --> 01:55:19.366]  And every time there's a video, they're eating at some super fancy restaurant, they got huge diamond rings on their fingers, it's always rich women, and they're just going, God Almighty, we're making so much money off these baby parts.
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:23.542]  There was just a way to keep them alive longer.
[01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:24.463]  Well, we're getting a problem.
[01:55:24.463 --> 01:55:28.706]  There's a lot of lawsuits and stuff that are on our ass about it, but let me tell you, we're talking billions here.
[01:55:28.706 --> 01:55:33.410]  But we're working on some bioethics where we can keep the little buggers alive, gut their asses.
[01:55:33.410 --> 01:55:43.358]  And look, I said I'd go to your calls and I haven't gone to you, but I get on this subject, folks, and you've got to understand what we're dealing with.
[01:55:43.358 --> 01:55:48.762]  You've got to understand the evil that we've allowed to grow and get out of control in this country.
[01:55:50.037 --> 01:55:57.119]  And they want your speech, and they want your guns, and they want your property, because they want to make you destitute, where they run your life.
[01:55:57.119 --> 01:55:59.920]  So I'll tell you this.
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:13.045]  Take a cut in pay, do whatever you got to do, but if you can do it, you've got children, get to the country, and find good people, and find a good church, and get together, and get self-sufficient, because society's going to collapse, and
[01:56:14.119 --> 01:56:15.120]  This is revelation.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:18.163]  I don't know if it's 10 years, 20 years down the road, but it's all real.
[01:56:18.163 --> 01:56:19.464]  You're going to have world government.
[01:56:19.464 --> 01:56:21.926]  You're going to have over a third of the world's population killed.
[01:56:21.926 --> 01:56:23.487]  Microchips in the brains.
[01:56:23.487 --> 01:56:24.848]  Satan on the planet.
[01:56:24.848 --> 01:56:25.709]  It's all going to happen.
[01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:26.390]  It's all true.
[01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:27.250]  It's all happening.
[01:56:27.250 --> 01:56:28.031]  It's all real.
[01:56:28.031 --> 01:56:30.974]  They're openly saying they're killing babies after they're born on television.
[01:56:30.974 --> 01:56:32.615]  They're editing humanoids.
[01:56:32.615 --> 01:56:34.537]  They're crossing humans with animals.
[01:56:34.537 --> 01:56:35.377]  And they're doing everything.
[01:56:35.377 --> 01:56:36.058]  It's all here.
[01:56:36.058 --> 01:56:36.558]  It's happening.
[01:56:36.558 --> 01:56:37.159]  It's true.
[01:56:37.159 --> 01:56:41.623]  God warned us and thinks that if we were given a warning, God gives us free will, but he loves his children.
[01:56:43.769 --> 01:56:45.890]  And so God gave us a cheat sheet.
[01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:49.192]  God said, I'm going to put you in the game because you deserve free will and I want to be with you forever.
[01:56:49.192 --> 01:56:52.373]  But I want free will entities of their own universe.
[01:56:52.373 --> 01:56:54.655]  God creates the new universe, a new consciousness.
[01:56:54.655 --> 01:56:56.115]  A new free will is a new universe.
[01:56:56.115 --> 01:57:01.198]  The only thing God can do that is outside of God is to turn you loose with your own free will.
[01:57:02.287 --> 01:57:05.948]  And create a whole new image of him that has free will.
[01:57:05.948 --> 01:57:12.449]  And then put you into a combat zone with lower dimensional demons that absolutely hate your ass because you're superior.
[01:57:12.449 --> 01:57:22.252]  God dumps his children into a prison planet war zone to see if you can handle it and deal with it to go to the next level.
[01:57:22.252 --> 01:57:23.092]  Think about that.
[01:57:23.092 --> 01:57:23.972]  Think God likes that?
[01:57:23.972 --> 01:57:25.072]  People say God's a sadist.
[01:57:25.072 --> 01:57:27.853]  No, God gave birth to free will.
[01:57:27.853 --> 01:57:31.074]  God gave birth to you and your spirit that was put in your mother.
[01:57:32.725 --> 01:57:44.022]  And that earth suit of all your ancestors to hold and love that child and now they're taking that sacred creature that's in the image of God and destroying it because they hate it because it's so superior!
[01:57:44.022 --> 01:57:45.204]  We'll be right back with your phone call.
[01:57:45.204 --> 01:57:45.585]  Stay with us.
[01:57:47.347 --> 01:57:55.730]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:57:55.730 --> 01:57:57.190]  Believe me, I know.
[01:57:57.190 --> 01:58:01.492]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:58:01.492 --> 01:58:04.973]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com.
[01:58:05.453 --> 01:58:07.135]  I still have that energy.
[01:58:07.135 --> 01:58:27.291]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[01:58:27.791 --> 01:58:31.552]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[01:58:35.453 --> 01:58:40.454]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[01:58:40.454 --> 01:58:43.195]  Unleash the Supermail in you.
[01:58:43.195 --> 01:58:45.536]  Supermail Vitality from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:48.930]  It's simple.
[01:58:48.930 --> 01:58:55.055]  If you want to beat the globalists, if you want to take on the new world order, I'm not doing Bitcoin pump and dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:58:55.055 --> 01:58:57.536]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:58:57.536 --> 01:59:01.179]  I'm not sitting here, you know, selling you late term abortion and all great it is.
[01:59:01.179 --> 01:59:03.921]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:59:03.921 --> 01:59:05.021]  What is the top tumor?
[01:59:05.021 --> 01:59:07.163]  It's a bestseller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:59:07.163 --> 01:59:09.084]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:59:09.184 --> 01:59:10.245]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:59:10.245 --> 01:59:12.186]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:59:12.186 --> 01:59:15.909]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle, but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:59:15.909 --> 01:59:18.951]  I'm like, uh, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:19.212]  Uh, 90, 95%.
[01:59:19.212 --> 01:59:20.793]  No one's ever done that.
[01:59:20.793 --> 01:59:22.574]  I said, how much does that cost per bottle?
[01:59:22.574 --> 01:59:23.515]  It costs $10.
[01:59:23.515 --> 01:59:25.036]  No one's ever done that.
[01:59:25.036 --> 01:59:26.817]  Sir, the average competitor's 3 to 5%.
[01:59:26.817 --> 01:59:27.498]  The top brand's 50%.
[01:59:27.498 --> 01:59:29.159]  I'm like, we're gonna have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:59:31.701 --> 01:59:34.623]  I mean, you understand, like, that's, like, our information's explosive.
[01:59:34.623 --> 01:59:35.223]  Our fish oil.
[01:59:35.223 --> 01:59:37.764]  I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:59:37.764 --> 01:59:38.825]  My children take it.
[01:59:38.825 --> 01:59:43.167]  You think I'm gonna give you fish oil that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:59:43.167 --> 01:59:46.169]  You think I'm gonna screw somebody over like one of these devil worshippers?
[01:59:46.169 --> 01:59:46.649]  Never!
[01:59:46.649 --> 01:59:51.251]  InfoWarshore.com.
[01:59:51.251 --> 01:59:53.913]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:11.190 --> 02:00:14.912]  All right.
[02:00:14.912 --> 02:00:16.772]  They have really loaded the schedule today.
[02:00:16.772 --> 02:00:19.454]  I want Tom Pappert to come on and host with us for hours.
[02:00:19.454 --> 02:00:21.194]  And George Norrie's coming up in 30 minutes.
[02:00:21.194 --> 02:00:22.295]  And I got loaded phone lines.
[02:00:22.295 --> 02:00:24.256]  I want to get Tom Pappert.
[02:00:24.256 --> 02:00:25.136]  He's a great patriot.
[02:00:25.136 --> 02:00:26.577]  Of course, he heads up Real.
[02:00:28.518 --> 02:00:29.559]  Real G.E.
[02:00:29.559 --> 02:00:34.082]  Trump, God Emperor Trump, and on Facebook.com, God Emperor Trump Official.
[02:00:34.082 --> 02:00:36.084]  He also manages one of the great TV stations we're on.
[02:00:36.084 --> 02:00:39.066]  Now you've been hearing me rant here, and I'm out of control.
[02:00:39.066 --> 02:00:43.149]  You know, when I start playing clips of governors saying we kill babies after they're born, I know what's behind it.
[02:00:43.149 --> 02:00:45.291]  I see Beto O'Rourke defending it.
[02:00:45.291 --> 02:00:54.518]  And then I know the whole game plan behind it, because my dad worked in hospital and dental office management for a long time, and I know a lot of people involved in it, not just him.
[02:00:54.518 --> 02:00:56.300]  And they all told me about this stuff 30 years ago.
[02:00:57.295 --> 02:00:58.237]  That was the whole main line.
[02:00:58.237 --> 02:01:03.528]  It actually, I mean I'll be honest, it actually makes me feel extremely vicious, Tom.
[02:01:03.528 --> 02:01:04.610]  How do you deal with this?
[02:01:04.610 --> 02:01:08.699]  With them flaunting it in our face that we're going to kill your babies after they're born.
[02:01:09.759 --> 02:01:13.663]  It is absolutely disgusting, and frankly Alex, I deal with it the same way you do.
[02:01:13.663 --> 02:01:20.509]  I get angry, I get visceral, I get red vision where I can't even see or think straight, because it's disgusting.
[02:01:20.509 --> 02:01:33.801]  They are ruining children, murdering them, selling them for parts, and if you're lucky enough to make it out of the womb, you're going to have a trans drag queen person shoving their male genitalia in your child's face.
[02:01:34.542 --> 02:01:40.916]  It is honestly the biggest affront to traditional values to America is what they're doing to children in this country.
[02:01:40.916 --> 02:01:43.361]  And like you, I just get angry.
[02:01:43.361 --> 02:01:44.604]  It's literally a gauntlet.
[02:01:45.899 --> 02:01:46.439]  Right.
[02:01:46.439 --> 02:01:47.480]  You cannot escape it.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:54.204]  I mean, and if you're lucky enough, again, if you make it out of the womb, you get to six years old, or now you've got Democrat presidential candidates.
[02:01:54.204 --> 02:01:55.885]  They say two years old.
[02:01:55.885 --> 02:02:02.509]  We need to send the kids to government schools so they can be indoctrinated to support that video that was just playing right there.
[02:02:02.509 --> 02:02:05.511]  Have a drag queen sing to a child.
[02:02:05.511 --> 02:02:06.931]  What's wrong with that?
[02:02:06.931 --> 02:02:10.213]  Look at it put its butt up in the kid's face.
[02:02:10.213 --> 02:02:12.455]  How do people see this and not just see right?
[02:02:12.455 --> 02:02:14.336]  And a lot of them are convicted child rapists.
[02:02:14.857 --> 02:02:17.304]  Literally, they're grooming children for all this.
[02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:20.391]  Right, that was in your home state of Texas.
[02:02:20.391 --> 02:02:22.253]  Granted, it was Houston and not Austin, I think.
[02:02:22.253 --> 02:02:28.659]  But yeah, a child predator convicted of indecent acts with an eight-year-old boy.
[02:02:28.659 --> 02:02:35.144]  Then we're going to put that guy in a dress and put him in a public library so he can go read to children.
[02:02:35.144 --> 02:02:36.786]  And nobody can explain this.
[02:02:36.786 --> 02:02:39.128]  Nobody can say why we need to have this stuff.
[02:02:39.128 --> 02:02:44.413]  Nobody has been able to say, well, you see, drag queens are a protected
[02:02:44.733 --> 02:02:52.743]  No, what it is, is it's predator men dressed up like women to get close to your kids and say, touch me, sit in my lap, shake your butt.
[02:02:52.743 --> 02:02:59.692]  Imagine if a man walked up in the park sort of saying to your daughter or son, shake your butt, touch my beard, you know, you know what would happen.
[02:03:00.879 --> 02:03:01.940]  Oh, it would be the end of the world.
[02:03:01.940 --> 02:03:07.267]  I mean, just imagine if a testosterone-filled dad brought his 12-year-old boy to a Hooters.
[02:03:07.267 --> 02:03:08.588]  That would be terrible.
[02:03:08.588 --> 02:03:16.898]  You can't have anything normal, but again, you get these weird, mentally ill men in dresses, and all of a sudden, oh, it's so cool!
[02:03:16.898 --> 02:03:17.639]  Oh, it's so neat!
[02:03:17.799 --> 02:03:18.400]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:28.349]  They say it's wrong if you're, you know, when your son's 16 or whatever, he's a little shy, to like, accidentally a playboy gets dropped by their room, or you encourage him to, you know, have your buddy at work, go out with his daughter or whatever.
[02:03:28.349 --> 02:03:30.131]  I mean, that's what people used to do.
[02:03:30.131 --> 02:03:31.412]  That's considered racy.
[02:03:31.412 --> 02:03:33.434]  You know, and bad, because that's toxic masculinity.
[02:03:33.434 --> 02:03:40.741]  No, let's instead have the kids that are all shy only be, when they're three years old, experience a big, fat, convicted child rapist shake their ass in their face.
[02:03:41.505 --> 02:03:42.005]  Right.
[02:03:42.005 --> 02:03:46.807]  And my only hope from all this, my only honest to God hope, is maybe these kids will rebel.
[02:03:46.807 --> 02:03:54.210]  Maybe they're going to see this social justice drag queen, abortion, promiscuity, insanity being shoved down their throats.
[02:03:54.210 --> 02:03:59.552]  And maybe that's why Gen Z is supposedly the most conservative generation since World War II.
[02:03:59.992 --> 02:04:02.474]  Because this is what they're being exposed to.
[02:04:02.474 --> 02:04:03.495]  It's a little bit like in the 90s.
[02:04:03.495 --> 02:04:07.378]  It's like, well, I guess it's the exact opposite, but it's almost the same.
[02:04:07.378 --> 02:04:11.822]  When the hardcore Christians were condemning comic books and video games and anything fun.
[02:04:11.822 --> 02:04:15.625]  And so that made kids want comic books and video games and anything fun.
[02:04:15.625 --> 02:04:22.331]  Maybe that's what's going to happen because from the age of two years old on up to 20, they're going to be told drag queens are good.
[02:04:22.331 --> 02:04:23.272]  Abortion is good.
[02:04:24.132 --> 02:04:25.433]  Sex with anybody is good.
[02:04:25.433 --> 02:04:26.194]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:26.194 --> 02:04:29.617]  I want to get into any other because you always got a lot of big subjects and take calls.
[02:04:29.617 --> 02:04:39.864]  We come back with Mr. Papert and I want to invite you to join us for in the full hour during the 50 hour transmission that we're smack dab in the first launch phase of here, baby.
[02:04:39.864 --> 02:04:40.004]  So...
[02:04:40.905 --> 02:04:42.788]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:42.788 --> 02:04:45.272]  And to the planet, the InfoWars eagle has landed.
[02:04:45.272 --> 02:04:46.794]  NewsWorks.com.
[02:04:46.794 --> 02:04:48.016]  InfoWars.com.
[02:04:48.016 --> 02:04:49.799]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:04:49.799 --> 02:04:52.062]  George Norrie coming up as well.
[02:04:52.062 --> 02:04:55.407]  And we'll tell you how you can tune in to the local TV station that I'm on at Tom Papert Heads.
[02:04:56.249 --> 02:05:01.452]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[02:05:01.452 --> 02:05:10.017]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:10.017 --> 02:05:12.998]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:12.998 --> 02:05:14.739]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.739 --> 02:05:21.023]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[02:05:23.104 --> 02:05:28.426]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[02:05:28.426 --> 02:05:31.388]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.388 --> 02:05:34.989]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:34.989 --> 02:05:39.291]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.291 --> 02:05:41.132]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:41.132 --> 02:05:47.214]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[02:05:47.214 --> 02:05:48.055]  Don't live
[02:05:48.895 --> 02:05:52.957]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[02:05:52.957 --> 02:05:54.298]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:05:54.298 --> 02:05:58.921]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:05:58.921 --> 02:06:03.283]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:19.395 --> 02:06:22.818]  This is Coast to Coast AM with your host, George Norrie.
[02:06:22.818 --> 02:06:28.222]  And now, from the City of Angels, George Norrie.
[02:06:28.222 --> 02:06:33.186]  George Norrie's coming up at the bottom of the hour, talking about the attack on free speech and how to fight back.
[02:06:33.186 --> 02:06:37.789]  Now they're banning books off Amazon, and New Zealand's banned Jordan Peterson.
[02:06:37.789 --> 02:06:39.971]  His book, nothing to do with shootings or anything.
[02:06:41.856 --> 02:06:44.557]  It's just, there's no bottom to it.
[02:06:44.557 --> 02:06:52.558]  They have major Democrat platforms calling for Ben Shapiro to be taken off the air.
[02:06:52.558 --> 02:06:54.699]  Boy, where was Ben defending me when I was getting censored?
[02:06:54.699 --> 02:06:56.379]  Well, I'll still defend him.
[02:06:56.379 --> 02:06:58.059]  It's crazy.
[02:06:58.059 --> 02:07:00.620]  It's absolutely insane.
[02:07:00.620 --> 02:07:02.400]  Mr. Papert is our guest.
[02:07:02.400 --> 02:07:05.021]  Tom, tell folks about the great TV station that you had up.
[02:07:05.021 --> 02:07:05.801]  People can tune into that.
[02:07:06.798 --> 02:07:12.641]  So we're KCTU TV 5, got the big 5 right behind me here on set in Wichita, Kansas.
[02:07:12.641 --> 02:07:24.487]  And if you're watching in Wichita or the surrounding area, put a paperclip, put a cheap antenna on the back of your TV and 9 out of 10 odds you will get Info Wars on Channel 5.4.
[02:07:24.487 --> 02:07:27.088]  And it's been honestly one of our most successful stations.
[02:07:27.088 --> 02:07:32.791]  We just got done moving Alex to a bigger studio, bigger facilities, doing all kinds of construction work to get it up to par.
[02:07:33.451 --> 02:07:39.956]  And as we did that, we found ourselves going, uh-oh, we need a bunch of extra help we didn't really intend on needing.
[02:07:39.956 --> 02:07:43.639]  We put out a Facebook post saying, hey, if you're an info warrior, we need you.
[02:07:43.639 --> 02:07:44.440]  Please come in.
[02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.240]  Give us a call.
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:46.121]  Say what you can do.
[02:07:46.121 --> 02:07:47.702]  We can use all the help in the world.
[02:07:47.702 --> 02:07:55.969]  We had a massive outpouring, and one guy in particular, Brandon, did a tremendous job, is basically the reason why we got up on the air as quick as we did.
[02:07:55.969 --> 02:07:58.891]  InfoWars is huge, and I'm glad we get to be a part of it.
[02:07:59.271 --> 02:08:07.834]  And let's be clear, everywhere we're on, within a year, it creates a fight on TV and radio for bigger stations to want to get the show, because we always become number one or close to it.
[02:08:07.834 --> 02:08:13.855]  And a lot of times ESPN comes in and buys out the station, and then we get taken off, and a year later the contract goes away, we get back on.
[02:08:13.855 --> 02:08:20.957]  Now you want to get into the whole thing behind the scenes, a lot of great stations, but there's been a fight over who gets the show, because the ratings just exploded.
[02:08:20.957 --> 02:08:22.638]  How many months did it take for the ratings to explode?
[02:08:23.698 --> 02:08:24.959]  Oh, I mean, it was overnight.
[02:08:24.959 --> 02:08:27.021]  As soon as people figured out what was going on.
[02:08:27.021 --> 02:08:33.906]  I mean, a lot of people watch, of course, they still have the app on their phone or they go to the InfoWars.com slash show.
[02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:41.572]  When you find out it can be as easy as pressing a button and going on TV, not a day goes by we don't get a phone call saying, I just found you guys.
[02:08:41.572 --> 02:08:43.113]  I found out you have Alex Jones.
[02:08:43.113 --> 02:08:44.454]  I found out you have RT.
[02:08:44.454 --> 02:08:45.975]  I found out you have Newsnet.
[02:08:45.975 --> 02:08:47.016]  Thank you so much.
[02:08:47.016 --> 02:08:48.397]  I'm your new biggest fan.
[02:08:48.397 --> 02:08:49.978]  And it has been absolutely tremendous.
[02:08:49.978 --> 02:08:51.459]  I mean, people cannot get enough of
[02:08:51.659 --> 02:09:00.181]  And it's so exciting when you're expanding programming and doing stuff like what's going on right now with this 50-hour live broadcast to protect the First Amendment.
[02:09:00.181 --> 02:09:01.501]  And people just love it.
[02:09:01.501 --> 02:09:04.102]  And I'm glad that we can be part of the Infowar.
[02:09:04.102 --> 02:09:04.422]  That's right.
[02:09:04.422 --> 02:09:05.722]  There's no reviews yet for it.
[02:09:05.722 --> 02:09:07.962]  It was an idea I had a few months ago with you.
[02:09:07.962 --> 02:09:09.243]  But it's at InfowarStore.com.
[02:09:09.243 --> 02:09:11.543]  We bought the best-selling antenna.
[02:09:11.543 --> 02:09:14.424]  We sell it for, what is it, $5 less than Amazon does.
[02:09:14.424 --> 02:09:17.464]  Infowar's HD digital TV antenna.
[02:09:17.464 --> 02:09:19.985]  Remember when TV didn't watch you, you watched television?
[02:09:20.445 --> 02:09:36.276]  And I had forgotten, and I didn't know how great digital TV was, so I'm not a big TV person, until I bought a condo that's next door to my parents' house, so my kids will have a place, you know, in college or whatever, down the road, so when I stay by my parents, who are in the middle of town, I can stay at the condo that's right next door, so I'm not sitting right on top of them.
[02:09:36.276 --> 02:09:41.379]  And I was going to put cable in, but I thought, well, I never really, you know, am there very much.
[02:09:41.379 --> 02:09:42.219]  And then my dad...
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:59.144]  Hooked up a digital antenna that was you know like 30 40 bucks and I mean look you're talking Here in Austin like a hundred plus digital channels And then they'll have four or five sub channels of every old cool TV show old movies.
[02:09:59.144 --> 02:10:05.765]  It's like way better than cable It's just insane and like 15 channels of Mexican TV with all those beautiful women.
[02:10:05.765 --> 02:10:06.245]  I'll be honest.
[02:10:06.245 --> 02:10:08.306]  That's what I like to watch It's just so hilarious
[02:10:08.806 --> 02:10:10.827]  I've even picked up some Spanish doing it.
[02:10:10.827 --> 02:10:13.029]  And plus, I do like Mexican music.
[02:10:13.029 --> 02:10:17.791]  The point is, is that it's through so many channels and it's not watching you.
[02:10:17.791 --> 02:10:18.992]  It's not tracking you.
[02:10:18.992 --> 02:10:21.513]  So we do sell the antennas at the lowest price you'll find.
[02:10:21.513 --> 02:10:22.334]  Nemfoolrestore.com.
[02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:24.221]  I think that is phenomenal.
[02:10:24.221 --> 02:10:36.186]  You know, it has exploded in this country as people are sick of ESPN, they're sick of Fox News, they're sick of the cable news networks, they're sick of the kneeling, they're sick of being gouged to $300 a month just to watch TV.
[02:10:36.186 --> 02:10:48.892]  They find out, yeah, you can plug in an antenna and even in a much smaller city like Wichita, Kansas, 62 or 64 channels on the air, all kinds of entertainment, everything from news to classics to sports, everything you could possibly want.
[02:10:48.892 --> 02:10:50.433]  And by the way, most cable is not real HD.
[02:10:50.433 --> 02:10:52.054]  What I get in Austin is so crisp.
[02:10:52.694 --> 02:10:59.020]  When I watch a football game or something that I cannot believe compared to what I get because they're compressing it off cable, folks.
[02:10:59.020 --> 02:10:59.861]  They're compressing it.
[02:10:59.861 --> 02:11:00.562]  It's not as good.
[02:11:01.658 --> 02:11:02.219]  Right.
[02:11:02.219 --> 02:11:02.439]  Right.
[02:11:02.439 --> 02:11:06.242]  You can get by with even less bandwidth over the air because of exactly what you said.
[02:11:06.242 --> 02:11:07.123]  There's no middleman.
[02:11:07.123 --> 02:11:13.308]  It's not going to the cable company, going into their system, being compressed, being downsized, being shipped back out to you.
[02:11:13.308 --> 02:11:15.250]  It is just the way it was intended.
[02:11:15.250 --> 02:11:17.512]  And I mean, really, we're in the middle of a renaissance here.
[02:11:17.512 --> 02:11:19.033]  And it's exactly what you say.
[02:11:19.033 --> 02:11:21.035]  People are watching TV.
[02:11:21.035 --> 02:11:22.316]  It's not watching them.
[02:11:22.316 --> 02:11:23.097]  It's traditional.
[02:11:23.097 --> 02:11:24.778]  It's going back to the roots.
[02:11:24.778 --> 02:11:26.680]  And all I can say is thanks, globalists.
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:27.741]  You're the ones who caused this.
[02:11:27.921 --> 02:11:28.221]  Exactly.
[02:11:28.221 --> 02:11:28.741]  I want to be clear.
[02:11:28.741 --> 02:11:30.863]  We're on a lot of cable stations, too, and they're great.
[02:11:30.863 --> 02:11:35.025]  It's just that broadcast TV is so cool now in HD.
[02:11:35.025 --> 02:11:39.027]  And again, I just didn't even know until I got this condo two years ago.
[02:11:39.027 --> 02:11:40.248]  And it's just crazy.
[02:11:40.248 --> 02:11:44.730]  And now at my house, we have got the digital antennas, and that's what we watch.
[02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:51.914]  And it's like Hawaii Five-0, Gilligan's Island, I Dream of Jeannie, Dallas, stuff from the 90s, new stuff.
[02:11:52.754 --> 02:11:57.300]  Like when the Olympics was on, I didn't know there were 10 channels of Olympics on TV.
[02:11:57.300 --> 02:11:59.864]  I mean, it's like, my God, this is way better than cable.
[02:11:59.864 --> 02:12:04.971]  And people don't know that it's free after you buy the antenna.
[02:12:04.971 --> 02:12:05.772]  So I'm digressing.
[02:12:05.772 --> 02:12:06.613]  I want to go to phone calls.
[02:12:06.613 --> 02:12:08.255]  But what you said is so true.
[02:12:08.255 --> 02:12:10.098]  Since they're taking over the Internet, these big platforms.
[02:12:10.658 --> 02:12:16.761]  Radio stations and TV stations, the only successful ones, I've talked to top consultants, are mainly liberal ones that are doing this now.
[02:12:16.761 --> 02:12:21.604]  Normally liberals fail and talk radio and TV, but in places like LA, San Francisco, some conservatives are doing it.
[02:12:21.604 --> 02:12:31.689]  They make it about community events, local coverage, special shows, the radio shows, simulcasts from TV shows, kind of what I invented doing, or what I pioneered doing, and so
[02:12:32.569 --> 02:12:48.739]  Like you said, put on Patriot Shows, One American News Network, whatever it is, Alex Jones, whatever, and in a few months you'll get that core of activists, and then they'll get involved in events, they'll get involved in boosting the station, they'll get involved in doing so many things like you just discovered.
[02:12:48.739 --> 02:12:57.684]  Again, it creates community again, and it's all there waiting for everybody, and UHF, VHF, digital television, I found, is the perfect venue.
[02:12:58.951 --> 02:12:59.791]  I agree completely.
[02:12:59.791 --> 02:13:01.192]  I couldn't have said it better myself.
[02:13:01.192 --> 02:13:02.052]  And it's so exciting.
[02:13:02.052 --> 02:13:06.514]  I mean, when we first kind of started this, we were just kind of calling, hey, can we carry the Alex Jones Show?
[02:13:06.514 --> 02:13:08.415]  Well, what if we want to carry David Knight?
[02:13:08.415 --> 02:13:09.696]  Is it possible we can have both?
[02:13:09.696 --> 02:13:11.597]  Well, what about Owen Schroyer and War Room?
[02:13:11.597 --> 02:13:12.897]  That would be really cool to have.
[02:13:12.897 --> 02:13:17.439]  And before you know it, you guys are saying, well, you know, we've kind of got this prototype of a TV network.
[02:13:17.439 --> 02:13:18.240]  Would you like to carry it?
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:20.281]  And we go, yes, absolutely.
[02:13:20.281 --> 02:13:21.521]  Let's do that right now.
[02:13:21.521 --> 02:13:25.363]  So it's very exciting to see InfoWars on the cutting edge as usual.
[02:13:26.661 --> 02:13:27.661]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[02:13:27.661 --> 02:13:35.104]  Again, please join us for a full hour to the 50-hour broadcast, Tom, because we've got George Norrie coming up, and I didn't realize we double-booked, and I want to hear from George Norrie as well.
[02:13:35.104 --> 02:13:39.165]  Again, let's go ahead and take a call from Gavin in Florida.
[02:13:39.165 --> 02:13:40.405]  You're on the air with Tom Papert.
[02:13:40.405 --> 02:13:42.546]  Go ahead.
[02:13:42.546 --> 02:13:43.306]  Hey.
[02:13:43.306 --> 02:13:43.726]  Hello?
[02:13:43.726 --> 02:13:44.046]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:44.046 --> 02:13:44.227]  Go ahead.
[02:13:44.227 --> 02:13:44.807]  Can you hear me?
[02:13:44.807 --> 02:13:45.427]  Yes, sir.
[02:13:45.427 --> 02:13:46.367]  Hey, how are you?
[02:13:46.367 --> 02:13:46.747]  Good, brother.
[02:13:46.747 --> 02:13:53.209]  I just wanted to let you know that I was watching your show, and this is the first time that I've ever called anyone like this.
[02:13:53.209 --> 02:13:53.749]  Thank you.
[02:13:53.749 --> 02:13:55.130]  Alex, I'm truly upset.
[02:13:56.098 --> 02:14:02.840]  I call as a single male, a white male, of course, but I have no kids.
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:06.281]  But I'm calling because of your Drag Queen Story Hour.
[02:14:06.281 --> 02:14:09.762]  It's coming to Jacksonville.
[02:14:09.762 --> 02:14:14.323]  And I called the places, they're not doing any background checks.
[02:14:14.323 --> 02:14:18.124]  They're not doing any background checks in any of the states.
[02:14:18.124 --> 02:14:24.646]  And in fact, I called... I have this... Can I... New York City chapter...
[02:14:25.635 --> 02:14:27.260]  Head of all of it.
[02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:29.065]  John Hamlet.
[02:14:29.065 --> 02:14:29.486]  Called him.
[02:14:30.222 --> 02:14:31.963]  They're not doing background checks.
[02:14:31.963 --> 02:14:36.325]  So they're using this as a vehicle to bring this into your public libraries.
[02:14:36.325 --> 02:14:47.630]  Yeah, no, this was created by a convicted murderer that used a hatchet and buzz saws to cut up his boyfriend, and who says, we want to corrupt your children, we're going to groom them.
[02:14:47.630 --> 02:14:49.070]  I mean, I've played the clips.
[02:14:49.070 --> 02:14:51.431]  They're saying, we're coming to corrupt your children.
[02:14:51.431 --> 02:14:52.912]  We're not going to tell the parents.
[02:14:52.912 --> 02:14:54.773]  In many cases, we're not going to do a background check.
[02:14:54.773 --> 02:14:55.573]  We're coming.
[02:14:55.573 --> 02:14:57.414]  And the liberals go, oh, liberal!
[02:14:58.399 --> 02:15:00.741]  I want everyone to flood their line.
[02:15:00.741 --> 02:15:03.745]  I want everyone to call the event managers of everywhere.
[02:15:03.745 --> 02:15:06.848]  In Jacksonville, they're having a Hamburger Marries and Cultivate Jack.
[02:15:07.635 --> 02:15:10.137]  Hamburger Mary's on Sunday.
[02:15:10.137 --> 02:15:11.038]  Listen, here's the deal, sir.
[02:15:11.038 --> 02:15:11.719]  Let me say this.
[02:15:11.719 --> 02:15:14.301]  Everyone should check their local listing peacefully and lawfully.
[02:15:14.301 --> 02:15:15.682]  Go expose it.
[02:15:15.682 --> 02:15:16.703]  Police should run the plates.
[02:15:16.703 --> 02:15:21.487]  There's a lot of sex offenders are going to be there, obviously, like flies that you know what.
[02:15:21.487 --> 02:15:24.469]  But, sir, they just canceled Drag Queen Storytime in Houston.
[02:15:24.469 --> 02:15:26.892]  They just canceled it in four cities in England.
[02:15:26.892 --> 02:15:31.315]  It's a global movement to test and prepare and groom your children.
[02:15:31.315 --> 02:15:33.457]  And that is an absolute fact.
[02:15:33.457 --> 02:15:34.618]  So thank you so much, Gavin.
[02:15:34.618 --> 02:15:35.379]  I'm glad you called.
[02:15:36.019 --> 02:15:41.241]  But yes, they're having one this Friday in New Braunfels, Texas.
[02:15:41.241 --> 02:15:46.602]  Indoctrinating children, teaching them giant fat men in disguises, and rub their hands all over them.
[02:15:46.602 --> 02:15:48.883]  And tell them about their rear ends.
[02:15:48.883 --> 02:15:50.904]  I'm telling you, it is the sickest evil.
[02:15:50.904 --> 02:15:54.925]  This is how evil comes, right in your face, smiling, with men dressed up like clowns.
[02:15:55.285 --> 02:15:59.166]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.

[02:20:16.020 --> 02:20:17.781]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:17.781 --> 02:20:18.681]  Tom Papert's our guest.
[02:20:18.681 --> 02:20:19.621]  George Norrie's popping in.
[02:20:19.621 --> 02:20:23.162]  He's probably got one of the first or second largest radio shows in the world.
[02:20:23.162 --> 02:20:23.622]  Need to know.
[02:20:23.622 --> 02:20:24.482]  Introduction.
[02:20:24.482 --> 02:20:28.303]  Want to get his take on the draconian censorship that's accelerating and how he thinks we stop it.
[02:20:29.636 --> 02:20:30.576]  I'll be back tonight.
[02:20:30.576 --> 02:20:33.558]  I'm going to be hosting 8 to 10 at least.
[02:20:33.558 --> 02:20:35.719]  I've got some very big special guests coming up.
[02:20:35.719 --> 02:20:39.100]  When I was out in L.A.
[02:20:39.100 --> 02:20:45.062]  with Joe Rogan on his podcast that is the biggest podcast in the world.
[02:20:45.062 --> 02:20:47.924]  I've got the third largest and second largest podcast.
[02:20:47.924 --> 02:20:50.585]  Elon Musk is still number one at like 40 million views.
[02:20:50.585 --> 02:20:53.046]  But if you add it all together, I'm at about 30 million right now.
[02:20:53.046 --> 02:20:56.307]  And it's taken a year for him to get to 40 million.
[02:20:56.307 --> 02:20:57.728]  So I think we're going to break that record soon.
[02:20:59.241 --> 02:21:02.723]  But Joe's like, oh yeah, I'll fly in a day early and then I'll come on the show, blah, blah.
[02:21:02.723 --> 02:21:04.705]  Now he's flying in a little bit later.
[02:21:04.705 --> 02:21:08.808]  I'll get an interview regardless, but he thinks he'll be in here like one or two tomorrow.
[02:21:09.787 --> 02:21:12.829]  But that's not set in stone yet, so look for that.
[02:21:12.829 --> 02:21:14.471]  Do a pretty hard-hitting interview.
[02:21:14.471 --> 02:21:15.612]  Pretty informative interview.
[02:21:15.612 --> 02:21:19.475]  And I like how Joe's gotten after the censorship now, and he's really standing up to it.
[02:21:19.475 --> 02:21:20.316]  That's what I wanted.
[02:21:20.316 --> 02:21:22.237]  I wasn't trying to be mean to him to get him to do that.
[02:21:22.237 --> 02:21:24.819]  I was going to cut bait, but a lot of things went on.
[02:21:24.819 --> 02:21:26.961]  Me and Joe had a lot of private conversations.
[02:21:26.961 --> 02:21:28.722]  Probably talked six, seven hours total.
[02:21:29.884 --> 02:21:33.568]  You know, three or four hours before, then in person a few hours, and then a few more hours.
[02:21:33.568 --> 02:21:35.990]  And so I figured out what's going on with Joe, and I understand it.
[02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:40.475]  And I think I went a little bit overboard going after Joe, because I just get a little bit wild out here sometimes.
[02:21:40.475 --> 02:21:45.180]  Tom Papert's our guest right now, and we've got so many calls here to get to.
[02:21:45.180 --> 02:21:47.523]  Let's see, question for pro-choicers.
[02:21:48.504 --> 02:21:49.524]  Abortion topic.
[02:21:49.524 --> 02:21:52.426]  We've got Lucas, the media attacks on Infowars.
[02:21:52.426 --> 02:21:56.107]  Chase, let's talk about the abortion issue in the Twilight Zone.
[02:21:56.107 --> 02:21:57.587]  Let's go to Chase, who's been holding the longest.
[02:21:57.587 --> 02:21:58.608]  Chase, you're on the air.
[02:21:58.608 --> 02:21:59.168]  Thanks for holding.
[02:21:59.168 --> 02:21:59.508]  Go ahead.
[02:21:59.508 --> 02:22:06.371]  Hey Alex, thank you so much for taking my call and thank you for doing this broadcast, standing up for free speech.
[02:22:06.371 --> 02:22:10.772]  You know, I'm trying to do the same thing with the page that I started on YouTube with your Reporter Challenge.
[02:22:10.772 --> 02:22:14.434]  And I do live shows every night and I also put together kind of edited videos.
[02:22:14.434 --> 02:22:14.694]  Thank you.
[02:22:14.694 --> 02:22:17.255]  And on this issue, on this issue of abortion,
[02:22:17.737 --> 02:22:19.377]  I really think we have an opportunity.
[02:22:19.377 --> 02:22:22.078]  I'm in the process of putting it together, actually.
[02:22:22.078 --> 02:22:27.719]  If you remember one of the most popular episodes, The Obsolescent Man, and Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:22:27.719 --> 02:22:28.940]  Oh, we used to play that all the time.
[02:22:28.940 --> 02:22:31.640]  We should dig that up and play it, start the next segment.
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:39.402]  But the thing is, if you relate that to what they're doing with abortion now, they are saying the exact same thing that the state says in that episode.
[02:22:39.402 --> 02:22:42.123]  They say that Mr. Wordsworth has no use.
[02:22:42.123 --> 02:22:42.983]  He has no worth.
[02:22:43.376 --> 02:22:47.299]  He is attached to the healthy body and so needs to be eliminated.
[02:22:47.299 --> 02:22:52.282]  And that is the exact same thing... That's bioethics, that's authoritarianism, that's eugenics.
[02:22:52.282 --> 02:22:57.485]  Rod Serling, who was a paratrooper commando in World War II, a hero, he was a smart guy.
[02:22:57.485 --> 02:23:00.668]  He wasn't making that up, he was copying that from the Nazis.
[02:23:01.428 --> 02:23:05.371]  And so that whole thing is about that, and Rod Serling was absolutely on target.
[02:23:05.371 --> 02:23:11.837]  Listen, you know why Beto O'Rourke, even though he outspent Ted Cruz 5-1 and engaged in election fraud, lost to Ted Cruz?
[02:23:11.837 --> 02:23:15.840]  Because Hispanic Christians, and this came out in the demographics and studies,
[02:23:16.681 --> 02:23:18.782]  This is highly studied here in Texas.
[02:23:18.782 --> 02:23:29.485]  Hispanic Americans who were Christian knew that Beto O'Rourke was for partial birth abortion, and they called Hispanic members of their family and said, you better not vote for Beto O'Rourke.
[02:23:29.485 --> 02:23:32.946]  And that's why they lost in key Hispanic counties.
[02:23:32.946 --> 02:23:33.946]  It's the only reason.
[02:23:33.946 --> 02:23:35.626]  They just thought Hispanics would just vote.
[02:23:35.626 --> 02:23:36.467]  You know who did vote?
[02:23:36.467 --> 02:23:37.647]  Dumb young people.
[02:23:37.647 --> 02:23:40.368]  And I'm not saying all young folks are dumb, but millennial scum
[02:23:40.968 --> 02:23:44.390]  Yes, exactly, and you think about how much things have changed from one generation to the next where
[02:24:02.165 --> 02:24:10.789]  They made those episodes and it was thought to be unbelievable that we would ever allow our state, our government, to look at human life that way.
[02:24:10.789 --> 02:24:15.531]  And now you look at today and how it's accepted, how it's pushed, it's just really troubling.
[02:24:15.531 --> 02:24:25.335]  And so again, I'm in the process of kind of making this where instead of Mr. Wordsworth, I want to have the story of a baby that's about to be aborted by the state and it's going to be visually
[02:24:26.428 --> 02:24:29.590]  Aligned with that episode, but completely updated.
[02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:31.251]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:24:31.251 --> 02:24:32.011]  Thank you so much.
[02:24:32.011 --> 02:24:36.573]  David Knight started his own YouTube channel because all the others have been banned about two weeks ago.
[02:24:36.573 --> 02:24:42.976]  He's very genteel, very gentlemanly, very matter-of-fact, very journalistic.
[02:24:42.976 --> 02:24:50.140]  He put up a thing defending Judge Jean and how Ilhan Omar is promoting Sharia law and showed her saying it.
[02:24:51.184 --> 02:24:53.731]  And they did a strike on the channel and threatened to take it down.
[02:24:53.731 --> 02:24:56.078]  This is a total censorship reign of terror.
[02:24:56.078 --> 02:24:56.659]  Thank you, Chase.
[02:24:56.659 --> 02:24:57.862]  You want to comment on that, Tom Pappert?
[02:24:59.033 --> 02:25:09.358]  You know, I do think that it's extremely telling that we're reinventing the same exact type of eugenics that was voiced upon people half a century ago, and I'm looking forward to seeing that.
[02:25:09.358 --> 02:25:12.440]  I think that when Chase puts that together, it could be very interesting.
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:17.883]  Yeah, Chase, make sure you bombard all of our emails and everything to make sure we get it, because we get so much great stuff.
[02:25:17.883 --> 02:25:20.884]  People all the time are like, hey, you saw my son's protein bar thing we did for him.
[02:25:20.884 --> 02:25:21.565]  I'm like, no, I didn't.
[02:25:22.065 --> 02:25:23.166]  There's only so many hours in a day.
[02:25:23.166 --> 02:25:24.327]  I know exactly how you feel at a much smaller level.
[02:25:24.327 --> 02:25:27.249]  You get so many emails, you get so many messages, it's hard to stay on top of everything.
[02:25:27.249 --> 02:25:29.670]  That's why the people who are persistent, that's why they break through.
[02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:30.211]  That's what I've learned.
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:51.361]  Yeah, well, people like you, Tom, that have reached hundreds of millions of people, you always say, oh, at a much smaller level, you're very self-deprecating.
[02:25:51.361 --> 02:25:53.382]  I want listeners to get this.
[02:25:53.382 --> 02:26:09.666]  From a single mom, to an auto mechanic, to an old man, to a young, whoever, people spreading the word, word of mouth, people creating their own YouTube video, people calling into a radio show, people going to city council, people praying to God, people putting energy towards good is the ultimate power.
[02:26:09.666 --> 02:26:10.226]  It's everything.
[02:26:10.226 --> 02:26:11.707]  It's where the rubber meets the road.
[02:26:11.707 --> 02:26:12.787]  It's all those little things.
[02:26:13.687 --> 02:26:19.349]  You know, making breakfast for your kids, being a loving person, trying to be honest, trying to be good.
[02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:21.509]  That's what makes the universe go round, folks.
[02:26:21.509 --> 02:26:24.870]  So don't ever think because you don't have a big show or whatever that you're not important.
[02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:26.310]  You're everything.
[02:26:26.310 --> 02:26:32.432]  They want this show shut down because you tune in and hear things you already know, but it reaffirms what you know and gives you
[02:26:34.645 --> 02:26:35.306]  Aiden Comfort.
[02:26:35.306 --> 02:26:36.869]  And that's what they don't want.
[02:26:36.869 --> 02:26:38.332]  They don't want me having Aiden Comfort.
[02:26:38.332 --> 02:26:39.934]  They don't want you having Aiden Comfort.
[02:26:39.934 --> 02:26:45.284]  They don't know we're getting bullied and attacked, you know, that we've got friends that we know that we're moving in the right direction.
[02:26:45.284 --> 02:26:47.027]  They don't want you to hear how we're winning.
[02:26:48.579 --> 02:26:50.081]  They don't want real people.
[02:26:50.081 --> 02:26:56.729]  They want somebody who's going to read from a teleprompter and it's going to be their talking points, whether it's CNN or Fox News, that's all it is now.
[02:26:56.729 --> 02:26:59.372]  And they don't like real human beings having discussions.
[02:26:59.372 --> 02:27:02.376]  I'm sure they hate that you have callers who bring this type of stuff up.
[02:27:02.376 --> 02:27:06.461]  I'm sure they hate that you advocate living a normal, value-based lifestyle.
[02:27:06.741 --> 02:27:13.386]  I'm sure that they hate that you call him Peto O'Rourke or Robert Francis O'Rourke or whatever he is, and you don't sit there and say, oh, it's wonderful.
[02:27:13.386 --> 02:27:19.351]  And one point that you brought up, you mentioned the type of people who go to the support Beto.
[02:27:19.351 --> 02:27:27.497]  And if you look, they look aesthetically like the exact same people who bring their toddlers to go see the drag queens.
[02:27:27.777 --> 02:27:37.482]  This is the same type of... They're chicken-necked, they look soulless, they can hardly talk, they never know what anything is when we talk to them, and it's like, you'll want to talk to them and find a smart person.
[02:27:37.482 --> 02:27:39.343]  No, we'll talk to 200 of them!
[02:27:39.343 --> 02:27:43.645]  They could be black, they could be white, they're mainly white, they could be young, they're all idiots!
[02:27:44.491 --> 02:27:45.091]  Right.
[02:27:45.091 --> 02:27:46.531]  They have nothing going on.
[02:27:46.531 --> 02:27:48.352]  Because again, they get programmed.
[02:27:48.352 --> 02:27:49.532]  They're NPCs.
[02:27:49.532 --> 02:27:51.212]  They're the meme in real life.
[02:27:51.212 --> 02:27:52.652]  They get programmed from the news.
[02:27:52.652 --> 02:27:54.313]  They get programmed from the schools.
[02:27:54.313 --> 02:27:55.753]  Drag Queen's good.
[02:27:55.753 --> 02:27:57.073]  Alex Jones, bad.
[02:27:57.073 --> 02:27:57.953]  And that's all they know.
[02:27:57.953 --> 02:27:59.794]  And they repeat it incessantly.
[02:27:59.794 --> 02:28:03.114]  And it almost makes it boring to interact with these people.
[02:28:03.114 --> 02:28:05.335]  By the way, we keep calling it Drag Queens.
[02:28:05.335 --> 02:28:06.995]  And that's what it's called.
[02:28:06.995 --> 02:28:07.815]  We have to address it as that.
[02:28:07.815 --> 02:28:12.156]  But Drag Queen Storytime is a worldwide event.
[02:28:12.856 --> 02:28:26.333]  With NAMBLA and others funding and supporting, sending in men dressed in bizarre clown outfits in disguises to basically recruit and prepare your children for an LGBTP situation.
[02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:28.670]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:33.932]  And you know, five years ago, we would have rightly made fun of this and said it belongs in a circus sideshow.
[02:28:33.932 --> 02:28:44.097]  And now, things have accelerated so fast and so furiously, that again, toddlers, go see the fat guy in a dress with a beard and his junk hanging out.
[02:28:44.097 --> 02:28:45.237]  Perfect.
[02:28:45.237 --> 02:28:46.198]  It's so progressive.
[02:28:46.198 --> 02:28:46.798]  It's liberal.
[02:28:46.798 --> 02:28:47.498]  It's wonderful.
[02:28:47.498 --> 02:28:48.179]  It's great.
[02:28:48.179 --> 02:28:48.979]  Thank you so much.
[02:28:48.979 --> 02:28:49.459]  God bless you.
[02:28:49.459 --> 02:28:50.600]  We'll be right back with Jordan Horwich.
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:50.920]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.251 --> 02:29:00.232]  Number one international best-selling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[02:29:00.232 --> 02:29:08.434]  Lyme disease bankrupt him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family after building a seven-figure business from his couch.
[02:29:08.434 --> 02:29:14.356]  God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[02:29:14.796 --> 02:29:17.438]  IRS, creditors, car loans, debt.
[02:29:17.438 --> 02:29:22.241]  It's the Babylonian system and you have to escape it before it's too late.

[02:29:56.204 --> 02:29:58.446]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[02:29:58.446 --> 02:30:00.187]  There is no set stasis.
[02:30:00.187 --> 02:30:01.428]  There is no managed system.
[02:30:01.428 --> 02:30:03.089]  There is no un-continuum.
[02:30:03.089 --> 02:30:06.311]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[02:30:06.311 --> 02:30:09.673]  So, you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[02:30:09.673 --> 02:30:10.894]  We won't just be here 100 years.
[02:30:10.894 --> 02:30:11.674]  We'll be here forever.
[02:30:11.674 --> 02:30:12.955]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[02:30:12.955 --> 02:30:19.840]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[02:30:19.840 --> 02:30:20.400]  We made it.
[02:30:20.400 --> 02:30:22.561]  And that's really where this goes.
[02:30:22.561 --> 02:30:24.383]  God's got a big war for you ready.
[02:30:24.383 --> 02:30:24.743]  And so,
[02:30:24.943 --> 02:30:31.550]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[02:30:31.550 --> 02:30:36.475]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[02:30:36.475 --> 02:30:39.338]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[02:30:39.338 --> 02:30:41.560]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:45.224]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[02:30:45.224 --> 02:30:46.265]  I want to go to the next level.
[02:30:46.505 --> 02:30:50.787]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced, not these devil worshippers.
[02:30:50.787 --> 02:30:53.668]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[02:30:53.668 --> 02:30:54.729]  I want life!
[02:30:54.729 --> 02:30:56.250]  I want Jesus!
[02:30:56.250 --> 02:30:59.331]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[02:30:59.331 --> 02:31:02.252]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:31:02.252 --> 02:31:05.214]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootworkstore.com.
[02:31:05.214 --> 02:31:09.796]  With MFootwork Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriot Supply, one of the top
[02:31:10.839 --> 02:31:19.968]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:31:19.968 --> 02:31:25.333]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[02:31:25.333 --> 02:31:27.616]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[02:31:27.616 --> 02:31:30.739]  MFORWARDSTORE.COM on MFORWARDSELECT storable foods.
[02:31:31.099 --> 02:31:32.580]  They've got special diet foods.
[02:31:32.580 --> 02:31:36.581]  They've got three-month supplies, year's supplies, week emergency supplies.
[02:31:36.581 --> 02:31:38.782]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:31:38.782 --> 02:31:40.343]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:31:40.343 --> 02:31:42.324]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:31:42.324 --> 02:31:44.865]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:31:44.865 --> 02:31:49.867]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:31:49.867 --> 02:31:55.249]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:31:56.155 --> 02:32:03.981]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems, and most of them are funded by the globalists.
[02:32:03.981 --> 02:32:07.304]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[02:32:07.304 --> 02:32:10.406]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[02:32:10.406 --> 02:32:11.947]  I didn't invent all this.
[02:32:11.947 --> 02:32:18.512]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana, and what really works for humanity, and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[02:32:18.512 --> 02:32:21.315]  And lo and behold, it's super popular, like it's always been.
[02:32:22.369 --> 02:32:25.710]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately.
[02:32:25.710 --> 02:32:30.332]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[02:32:30.332 --> 02:32:43.876]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at InfoWarsStore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[02:32:43.876 --> 02:32:45.817]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family,
[02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:51.741]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done, because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[02:32:51.741 --> 02:32:59.768]  You are the InfoWars, and I salute you.
[02:32:59.768 --> 02:33:02.430]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:10.689 --> 02:33:13.651]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[02:33:13.651 --> 02:33:15.832]  Because it leads to the future.
[02:33:15.832 --> 02:33:19.274]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[02:33:19.274 --> 02:33:21.515]  This is not a new world.
[02:33:21.515 --> 02:33:25.938]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[02:33:25.938 --> 02:33:33.382]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[02:33:34.352 --> 02:33:42.397]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[02:33:42.397 --> 02:33:48.140]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:55.725]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[02:33:55.725 --> 02:33:58.467]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[02:33:58.467 --> 02:33:59.467]  In his last 48 hours on Earth,
[02:34:01.147 --> 02:34:05.108]  He's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[02:34:05.108 --> 02:34:07.569]  Because he is built out of flesh.
[02:34:07.569 --> 02:34:09.870]  And because he has a mind.
[02:34:09.870 --> 02:34:25.136]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[02:34:25.136 --> 02:34:27.476]  Well, Juhasz means I hate you in German.
[02:34:27.476 --> 02:34:29.017]  But what would it mean, I love you?
[02:34:30.931 --> 02:34:31.752]  I love George Norrie.
[02:34:46.887 --> 02:35:00.015]  Back in like 2002-2003, he already had three or four or five Emmys under his belt, award-winning news director, Naval veteran, officer, already a very successful syndicated radio host.
[02:35:00.015 --> 02:35:03.877]  He took over for the late great Art Bell, now late great.
[02:35:03.877 --> 02:35:05.958]  And back then, let me tell you something.
[02:35:06.118 --> 02:35:08.260]  He had me on and put his job on the line.
[02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:09.320]  I know the backside story.
[02:35:09.320 --> 02:35:10.421]  He didn't even know I know it.
[02:35:10.421 --> 02:35:13.884]  But I've talked to some of the executives and they said, it's on you, buddy.
[02:35:13.884 --> 02:35:15.125]  Because he'd only been on the air about a year.
[02:35:15.125 --> 02:35:20.849]  One of the top shows in the world, probably the second, if not the largest show in the world.
[02:35:20.849 --> 02:35:24.131]  Him and Lombard neck and neck now on stations and affiliates.
[02:35:24.131 --> 02:35:25.652]  It's not about bragging.
[02:35:25.652 --> 02:35:29.215]  It's about when you've got everything and you put it on the line.
[02:35:30.415 --> 02:35:42.698]  And George brought me on for three hours, didn't script, didn't tell me what I could say, didn't do any of that, and then years later I learned that his job was on the line, but he said, I'm going to do it, I'm going to interview this guy.
[02:35:42.698 --> 02:35:48.119]  And so yeah, it's that show that helped really take us to the next level, the DrudgeReport.com, linking to us.
[02:35:48.119 --> 02:35:54.181]  I'm always very, very thankful to George Norrie, and it's great to know that people like him and Clyde Lewis and others are there
[02:35:54.821 --> 02:35:57.082]  Who still have 10, 15 million viewers.
[02:35:57.082 --> 02:36:00.264]  George, you know, probably, I don't know, 16, 17 million a week.
[02:36:00.264 --> 02:36:01.484]  Somebody like Clyde, like 5 million.
[02:36:01.484 --> 02:36:09.448]  The point is, it's good to know that people like him are still the biggest things out there, but corporate media, the internet, ignore it.
[02:36:09.448 --> 02:36:12.850]  So it's a perfect time to bring George Norrie of Coast2CoastAM.com.
[02:36:12.850 --> 02:36:14.591]  He also hosts a national TV show as well.
[02:36:15.171 --> 02:36:21.697]  To give us his take on Jordan Peterson's book, The 12 Steps to a Good Life, banned in New Zealand.
[02:36:21.697 --> 02:36:23.820]  Zero Hedges IP addresses now.
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:26.222]  The website now banned.
[02:36:26.222 --> 02:36:29.085]  You know, Limbaugh came out and said this guy's a leftist.
[02:36:29.085 --> 02:36:30.546]  He could have done it to blame right-wingers.
[02:36:30.546 --> 02:36:31.627]  That's in the manifesto.
[02:36:31.627 --> 02:36:35.251]  Whether Rush is right or wrong, he has a right to say it.
[02:36:35.251 --> 02:36:38.273]  A new YouTube channel we had got taken down for me playing Rush.
[02:36:38.934 --> 02:36:43.855]  So, George, what do you make of this attack on free speech that's gone into overdrive?
[02:36:43.855 --> 02:36:45.576]  And, you know, you were going to run for president.
[02:36:45.576 --> 02:36:47.436]  They tried to draft you years ago.
[02:36:47.436 --> 02:36:53.658]  I wouldn't support anybody over Trump but you, if I could draft you to do it, because you've said you'd be pro-free speech.
[02:36:53.658 --> 02:37:03.521]  So as a journalist, as a naval officer, as a father, a grandfather, I'm kind of ranting here with the time we have, what would you call this period we're in and what should be done?
[02:37:03.521 --> 02:37:06.842]  Because I like Trump, but I'm getting really upset about the censorship.
[02:37:08.217 --> 02:37:11.841]  Alex, we are in a situation, and it's great to be with you again, my friend.
[02:37:11.841 --> 02:37:13.523]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[02:37:13.523 --> 02:37:19.350]  We are in a situation right now that the First Amendment is under fire.
[02:37:19.350 --> 02:37:23.916]  Something is happening, not only just in this country, but on this planet, where
[02:37:26.169 --> 02:37:37.098]  The globalists, the people who think they're in charge, want to muffle free speech and hold back on our ability to tell the world how we feel.
[02:37:37.098 --> 02:37:39.419]  Now, there's a fine line here.
[02:37:39.419 --> 02:37:45.764]  I mean, I don't want to go to a baseball game with my family and have some guy in the back screaming obscenities.
[02:37:45.764 --> 02:37:47.045]  To me, that's not free speech.
[02:37:47.045 --> 02:37:48.446]  And plus, that's a private event.
[02:37:48.446 --> 02:37:51.289]  Everybody's agreeing they're going for a baseball game.
[02:37:51.289 --> 02:37:52.289]  Exactly.
[02:37:52.289 --> 02:37:53.230]  What free speech is,
[02:37:55.077 --> 02:38:04.641]  It's what you do, and you're being muffled for things that I have never seen before in my life.
[02:38:04.641 --> 02:38:05.681]  People are panicking.
[02:38:05.681 --> 02:38:13.304]  They hear one thing about Alex Jones or some other individual, and they clip you because they think they've got the power to do it.
[02:38:13.844 --> 02:38:17.026]  That's very dangerous in this society.
[02:38:17.026 --> 02:38:32.735]  We're going to get to a point in this country, if we're not very careful, where the internet is going to be 100% controlled by government or by globalists, and they will tell you what you can see, what you can Google, and that's very dangerous for society.
[02:38:34.261 --> 02:38:34.761]  Absolutely right.
[02:38:34.761 --> 02:38:36.343]  I don't want to make this about me.
[02:38:36.343 --> 02:38:37.704]  It's about courage.
[02:38:37.704 --> 02:38:43.328]  What made you, in 2003, have me on?
[02:38:43.328 --> 02:38:45.029]  Brian Lamb attacked it the next day.
[02:38:45.029 --> 02:38:45.970]  CNN attacked it.
[02:38:45.970 --> 02:38:47.311]  I mean, they were watching.
[02:38:47.311 --> 02:38:48.692]  It was one of your best shows ever.
[02:38:48.692 --> 02:38:49.673]  Highest rated ever.
[02:38:49.673 --> 02:38:53.556]  What made you go to bat and have me on your show?
[02:38:53.556 --> 02:38:56.118]  The two goons that you sent to my house the night before.
[02:38:59.356 --> 02:39:00.837]  I'm kidding, but of course.
[02:39:00.837 --> 02:39:04.098]  Look, I had a call from one of our listeners.
[02:39:04.098 --> 02:39:07.359]  I did not know you from Adam at that time.
[02:39:07.359 --> 02:39:11.360]  And he said, you've got to have this guy named Alex Jones on your show.
[02:39:11.360 --> 02:39:18.102]  And of course, when a listener calls me and gives me information, I'm going to follow up on it because I care about my listeners.
[02:39:18.782 --> 02:39:23.486]  And I started listening to you on InfoWars.com.
[02:39:23.486 --> 02:39:28.410]  I did some research and I said, boy, this guy, he could be a loose cannon.
[02:39:28.410 --> 02:39:31.132]  I better check into this guy a little bit more.
[02:39:31.132 --> 02:39:35.656]  And then I started listening to you more and more and more.
[02:39:35.656 --> 02:39:37.557]  And I said, you know what?
[02:39:37.557 --> 02:39:40.780]  About 90% of what this guy Alex Jones says
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:44.101]  It's pretty right on, in my opinion.
[02:39:44.101 --> 02:39:45.981]  I'm going to put him on.
[02:39:45.981 --> 02:39:48.002]  And you were just electrifying.
[02:39:48.002 --> 02:39:52.363]  My phone's lit up faster than any other guest I've ever had on.
[02:39:52.363 --> 02:39:56.103]  And I decided, I'm going to put Alex on.
[02:39:56.103 --> 02:39:59.844]  We're going to talk a little bit about rules and regulations.
[02:39:59.844 --> 02:40:02.665]  You're not a foul-mouthed guy on the air.
[02:40:02.665 --> 02:40:05.606]  You understand the power of radio.
[02:40:05.606 --> 02:40:08.726]  And I took a chance, and it worked.
[02:40:08.726 --> 02:40:10.787]  It worked for me, and it worked for you at the time.
[02:40:12.447 --> 02:40:18.751]  I only brought that up because this 50 hour broadcast I'm doing until Saturday at 10 is about what do we do?
[02:40:18.751 --> 02:40:22.533]  I mean my honeymoon is becoming over with Trump.
[02:40:22.533 --> 02:40:29.197]  I still like a lot of what he's done, America First, but I mean they're doing nothing while draconian censorship is happening to everybody.
[02:40:29.197 --> 02:40:34.140]  I mean they had a major Democratic Party event two days ago where they said take Ben Shapiro off the internet.
[02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:35.581]  Deplatform Ben Shapiro.
[02:40:35.581 --> 02:40:36.682]  I mean this is getting dangerous.
[02:40:37.648 --> 02:40:41.631]  Yeah, it's out of control.
[02:40:41.631 --> 02:40:42.491]  It's crazy.
[02:40:42.491 --> 02:40:47.055]  It's what a communist nation would do to suppress its people.
[02:40:47.055 --> 02:40:48.416]  That's what you do.
[02:40:48.416 --> 02:40:55.681]  Before you begin to change government, you change the way the public has an ability to communicate and speak.
[02:40:56.441 --> 02:41:07.845]  I don't think they anticipated, Alex, years ago, the strength of social media, the strength of the internet, the strength of streaming, the strength of podcasting.
[02:41:07.845 --> 02:41:13.587]  I don't think anybody ever thought it would get this big, this strong, this soon.
[02:41:13.587 --> 02:41:18.769]  And they're scared now, because they don't know how to handle the population, so they figure the only way they can
[02:41:19.689 --> 02:41:20.050]  I think so.
[02:41:40.570 --> 02:41:41.951]  I totally agree with you.
[02:41:41.951 --> 02:41:45.632]  And I remember when I was on with you 16, 17 years ago, you said that then.
[02:41:45.632 --> 02:41:48.533]  And nationalists, populists are getting elected everywhere.
[02:41:48.533 --> 02:41:50.233]  People are getting more into free market again.
[02:41:50.233 --> 02:41:55.955]  I mean, I agree with you that intellectually people are waking up and that's exactly why, as you said, the establishment's gotten scared.
[02:41:55.955 --> 02:41:58.756]  But how do they think they can put the toothpaste back in the tube?
[02:42:00.043 --> 02:42:01.724]  Well, that's a good question.
[02:42:01.724 --> 02:42:02.965]  They can't.
[02:42:02.965 --> 02:42:04.265]  But they think they can.
[02:42:04.265 --> 02:42:06.987]  And it's going to backfire on all of them.
[02:42:06.987 --> 02:42:12.910]  You know, you just mentioned that some people had approached me years ago to see if I wanted to run for president.
[02:42:12.910 --> 02:42:14.190]  I'm not a Democrat.
[02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:15.211]  I'm not a Republican.
[02:42:15.211 --> 02:42:16.752]  I'm not a libertarian.
[02:42:16.752 --> 02:42:18.633]  I call it the way I see it.
[02:42:18.633 --> 02:42:23.055]  I don't even vote for president because I want to remain impartial when I'm on the air.
[02:42:23.055 --> 02:42:26.677]  I don't want anybody ever accusing me of favoritism or anything like that.
[02:42:27.217 --> 02:42:28.718]  I call it the way I see it.
[02:42:28.718 --> 02:42:33.401]  Whether I think President Trump does a good job or not, I call it the way I see it.
[02:42:33.401 --> 02:42:36.103]  Do a little InfoWars poll for me if you can.
[02:42:36.103 --> 02:42:39.925]  Throw my name in the Democratic cat because that's the opposition right now.
[02:42:39.925 --> 02:42:40.666]  You know what?
[02:42:40.666 --> 02:42:42.467]  It's funny you said that.
[02:42:42.467 --> 02:42:43.147]  Stay there.
[02:42:43.147 --> 02:42:44.188]  That's a genius idea.
[02:42:44.188 --> 02:42:45.149]  I'm gonna go in there right now.
[02:42:45.149 --> 02:42:48.991]  We're gonna put the top four Democrats up with George Norrie's name.
[02:42:48.991 --> 02:42:50.152]  InfoWars.com poll.
[02:42:50.152 --> 02:42:51.312]  We should do more polls.
[02:42:51.312 --> 02:42:52.693]  Sometimes we get like 200,000 people.
[02:42:52.693 --> 02:42:53.474]  Usually it's about 50,000.
[02:42:55.043 --> 02:43:00.766]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:46:59.167 --> 02:47:01.790]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:47:22.472 --> 02:47:23.633]  We're going back to George Norrie.
[02:47:23.633 --> 02:47:27.518]  I'm going to host the fourth hour and I'm going to get to every caller that's been holding.
[02:47:27.518 --> 02:47:32.823]  Charity, and Dave, and Lee, and Dustin, and Jessica, and Sean, and Dennis, and Randy, and Lucas, and Morgan, and Jeff.
[02:47:32.823 --> 02:47:34.505]  I'm going to go bam, bam, bam.
[02:47:34.505 --> 02:47:37.008]  George Norrie leaves us here in about 10 minutes.
[02:47:37.008 --> 02:47:39.711]  We're in the 50-hour broadcast going until Saturday at 10 a.m.
[02:47:39.711 --> 02:47:40.832]  I'm going to ask George Norrie.
[02:47:41.846 --> 02:47:51.092]  If he does run for president, and he's a smart guy, naval veteran, won three Emmys, all the rest of it, grandpa, young grandpa at that, what would he do for the First Amendment?
[02:47:51.092 --> 02:47:52.192]  Because that's what this is all about.
[02:47:52.192 --> 02:47:55.134]  What are we going to do to save the First Amendment?
[02:47:55.134 --> 02:47:57.576]  I'm going to talk to George Norrie here in just a moment.
[02:47:57.576 --> 02:48:00.638]  But first, we're running a 50-hour broadcast.
[02:48:00.638 --> 02:48:04.220]  It's a fundraiser as well to defend our operation against the globalists.
[02:48:04.220 --> 02:48:05.861]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[02:48:05.861 --> 02:48:09.723]  Store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements, a bunch of other big specials.
[02:48:09.723 --> 02:48:10.584]  But every hour,
[02:48:11.584 --> 02:48:12.685]  For only one hour.
[02:48:12.685 --> 02:48:15.788]  Should have been plugging this from the start of the hour.
[02:48:15.788 --> 02:48:19.232]  We have a product, even bigger discount than 50% off.
[02:48:19.232 --> 02:48:22.615]  Brain Force Plus is our best-selling product.
[02:48:22.615 --> 02:48:25.097]  It isn't our most profitable because we hardly make any money on it.
[02:48:25.097 --> 02:48:27.179]  Comparable Super Neutropics for $60.
[02:48:27.179 --> 02:48:28.661]  We normally sell it for $40.
[02:48:28.661 --> 02:48:31.824]  At $19.95, ladies and gentlemen, it's a good deal.
[02:48:31.824 --> 02:48:31.904]  At $15.96.
[02:48:35.896 --> 02:48:38.757]  It is a loss leader when we give you the free shipping.
[02:48:38.757 --> 02:48:41.097]  But I want you to see how great this Nootropic is.
[02:48:41.097 --> 02:48:43.098]  It has 6,000 reviews, 4.6 stars, 92%.
[02:48:43.098 --> 02:48:45.438]  It is amazing.
[02:48:45.438 --> 02:48:48.419]  Brain Force Plus for clarity, focus, all of it.
[02:48:48.419 --> 02:48:49.079]  It's amazing.
[02:48:49.079 --> 02:48:51.020]  Now a 20% more in each bottle.
[02:48:51.020 --> 02:48:51.940]  It's 60% off.
[02:48:51.940 --> 02:48:57.361]  And since it's only plugged at the end of the hour, we'll extend that for a couple hours.
[02:48:57.361 --> 02:48:58.741]  60% off and store-wide free shipping.
[02:48:58.741 --> 02:49:00.002]  Double Patriot points.
[02:49:00.002 --> 02:49:00.882]  Meeting on your next order.
[02:49:01.502 --> 02:49:03.803]  You get 10% off, not 5% off.
[02:49:03.803 --> 02:49:08.626]  Sign up for AutoShip on things like the Wake Up America coffee, or the protein bars, or the fish oil.
[02:49:08.626 --> 02:49:11.687]  Things you want to reorder every 15 days, every month, every two months.
[02:49:11.687 --> 02:49:17.370]  Cancelling time, you get 10% off additionally.
[02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:18.671]  All right, going back to George Norey.
[02:49:18.671 --> 02:49:20.212]  We're getting a poll up, George.
[02:49:21.178 --> 02:49:29.644]  Since you postulated it, if this was the list of top contenders, and George Horry was on the list, who would you vote for?
[02:49:29.644 --> 02:49:39.151]  So we've got that Infowars.com poll going up, and I guess we'll run that poll through the 50 hours, and we'll give you those results on Saturday.
[02:49:39.151 --> 02:49:41.133]  I would imagine we'll probably get a couple hundred thousand votes.
[02:49:42.683 --> 02:49:52.750]  If those results come out positive, I want you to blitz that poll, Alex, to the mainstream media, and see if they pick that up, and see what they do, and see if they run with that.
[02:49:52.750 --> 02:50:02.697]  I want to see if there's a candidate that the American public could grasp without the political machine pushing them first, and see what happens.
[02:50:02.697 --> 02:50:04.979]  Let's see what happens.
[02:50:04.979 --> 02:50:05.639]  I agree with you.
[02:50:05.639 --> 02:50:06.620]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:50:08.192 --> 02:50:13.774]  What would you do if you were President Trump, or if you were President, to counter big tech censorship?
[02:50:13.774 --> 02:50:17.235]  I mean, they lie to Congress, their own internal videos admit they're doing it.
[02:50:17.235 --> 02:50:21.597]  It's getting worse by the minute.
[02:50:21.597 --> 02:50:25.238]  I would make sure that the one thing that we must avoid
[02:50:26.141 --> 02:50:28.102]  is hatred toward people.
[02:50:28.102 --> 02:50:29.822]  I don't care about criticism.
[02:50:29.822 --> 02:50:32.643]  I don't care about the ability for free speech.
[02:50:32.643 --> 02:50:34.504]  We should be entitled to that.
[02:50:34.504 --> 02:50:41.946]  What we need to stop in this country is this divide that we have right now, Alex, that I've never seen this bad before.
[02:50:42.686 --> 02:50:45.328]  Or you can't even conduct dialogue with somebody.
[02:50:45.328 --> 02:50:54.773]  If you walked into a bar today, sat down to have a beer, and talked to the guy next to you, if he doesn't agree with your views, it's a screaming session.
[02:50:54.773 --> 02:50:56.154]  It's not a discussion.
[02:50:56.154 --> 02:50:57.455]  It's not a debate.
[02:50:57.455 --> 02:50:59.756]  It's not honest dialogue anymore.
[02:50:59.756 --> 02:51:01.597]  It's a screaming session.
[02:51:01.597 --> 02:51:03.318]  It's, you know, I get emails.
[02:51:03.318 --> 02:51:06.060]  I've got news guests on my show all the time.
[02:51:06.060 --> 02:51:07.501]  Some are left, some are right.
[02:51:08.101 --> 02:51:18.726]  When I got a guy on who's more right-wing, Dr. John Curtis, OnlineColumnist.com, I'll get all kinds of hate email from people on the left.
[02:51:18.726 --> 02:51:21.827]  Then I'll have Howard Blum on, who's left.
[02:51:21.827 --> 02:51:24.788]  I get hate mail from those on the right.
[02:51:24.788 --> 02:51:26.729]  We gotta fix this in this country.
[02:51:26.729 --> 02:51:33.772]  We gotta get to a point where people can argue and debate and not scream and yell at people anymore.
[02:51:33.772 --> 02:51:36.593]  That's gotta stop, or we're gonna head down the wrong path.
[02:51:36.693 --> 02:51:39.294]  So what you're saying is people need to be tolerant, but let's just be honest.
[02:51:39.294 --> 02:51:42.534]  90% of the attacks are the left against the right.
[02:51:42.534 --> 02:51:43.795]  People that are Trump supporters.
[02:51:43.795 --> 02:51:45.615]  The left are the ones driving the censorship.
[02:51:45.615 --> 02:51:46.975]  I know you're not left or right.
[02:51:46.975 --> 02:51:48.676]  You're more of a libertarian like I am.
[02:51:48.676 --> 02:51:51.976]  And I guess you'd probably run as a Democrat because that's obviously the video you could do that.
[02:51:51.976 --> 02:51:57.397]  Why don't Democrats have candidates like you that are more classic Americana A and then B?
[02:51:57.397 --> 02:51:59.078]  What would you do though as president?
[02:52:00.046 --> 02:52:05.411]  Separate from trying to say, hey, let's have a, you know, a debate is okay.
[02:52:05.411 --> 02:52:10.495]  What would you do to stop these big tech companies and their monopolies?
[02:52:10.495 --> 02:52:11.697]  Oh, you'd get tough with them.
[02:52:11.697 --> 02:52:12.477]  Absolutely.
[02:52:12.477 --> 02:52:15.660]  And more importantly, you get to know the CEOs.
[02:52:15.660 --> 02:52:18.082]  You know, Jack Dorsey was from St.
[02:52:18.082 --> 02:52:18.483]  Louis.
[02:52:18.483 --> 02:52:19.123]  I'm from St.
[02:52:19.123 --> 02:52:19.744]  Louis.
[02:52:19.744 --> 02:52:22.426]  You get to know these people and say, what are you doing?
[02:52:22.426 --> 02:52:23.667]  Quit panicking.
[02:52:23.667 --> 02:52:25.589]  They are only reacting because
[02:52:25.609 --> 02:52:27.129]  Because they're panicking.
[02:52:27.129 --> 02:52:32.111]  Somebody is putting pressure on them to muffle Alex Jones.
[02:52:32.111 --> 02:52:35.892]  Somebody is putting pressure on them to pull websites.
[02:52:35.892 --> 02:52:37.512]  They're not doing this on their own.
[02:52:37.512 --> 02:52:40.033]  You've been around for a long, long time.
[02:52:40.033 --> 02:52:42.813]  You've been the same.
[02:52:42.813 --> 02:52:47.834]  You're not any more or less vocal than you were 10, 15 years ago.
[02:52:47.834 --> 02:52:52.636]  Somebody's getting to these people, Alex, and scaring the living daylights out of them.
[02:52:52.636 --> 02:52:53.516]  And that's got to stop.
[02:52:54.551 --> 02:52:55.711]  Well they are.
[02:52:55.711 --> 02:53:03.474]  They had every major news channel in the country, the television channel, Lester Holt led it, say that I said get battle rifles and go kill the media.
[02:53:03.474 --> 02:53:04.634]  They didn't show a clip.
[02:53:04.634 --> 02:53:05.634]  They read quotes.
[02:53:05.634 --> 02:53:07.355]  You've never said that.
[02:53:07.355 --> 02:53:08.915]  Never said it.
[02:53:08.915 --> 02:53:10.076]  I offered a million dollars.
[02:53:10.916 --> 02:53:14.318]  It was a 34-minute podcast, a 38-minute podcast.
[02:53:14.318 --> 02:53:22.864]  I said, if Antifa comes to your house, they dox ICE and they dox Rand Paul and Tucker Carlson, you better have your battle rifle ready to defend yourself if they attack you.
[02:53:22.864 --> 02:53:24.686]  And that turns into, I say, kill the media?
[02:53:26.045 --> 02:53:36.590]  When you've been on my show before, you cite actual stories that have happened, that are in the media, and then you react to it, and then you comment on it.
[02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:44.614]  But never, ever on my program have I heard you say anything to hurt anybody, to destroy somebody.
[02:53:44.614 --> 02:53:46.695]  You don't threaten violence.
[02:53:46.695 --> 02:53:48.016]  I don't get where it's coming from.
[02:53:50.287 --> 02:53:53.311]  Well, I'm colorful and I can take things out of context.
[02:53:53.311 --> 02:53:56.116]  I'm not, let's say, smooth like you a lot of times.
[02:53:56.116 --> 02:53:57.137]  And so I'm an easy target.
[02:53:57.137 --> 02:53:58.419]  I think that's really what it comes down to.
[02:53:58.419 --> 02:54:00.682]  You're not a politician, that's for sure.
[02:54:01.601 --> 02:54:23.698]  Well, how far do you think it's going to go now that they're getting down to trying, not trying, they're banning Jordan Peterson's book in New Zealand, they're banning Zero Hedge's URL, they're calling for our URL to be banned, they're calling for Ben Shapiro to be banned off the internet, they're banning Trump's main social media person off Facebook for no reason.
[02:54:23.698 --> 02:54:25.079]  I mean, it's out of control.
[02:54:25.079 --> 02:54:26.580]  And as you said, they've panicked.
[02:54:26.580 --> 02:54:30.784]  Don't they get that they're causing a bigger crisis than I think they're fighting?
[02:54:31.883 --> 02:54:32.944]  They will eventually.
[02:54:32.944 --> 02:54:36.788]  I think they'll have such an outcry, they're going to realize, oh my gosh, what have we done?
[02:54:36.788 --> 02:54:47.197]  But at this point right now, they're going with what they are thinking is the public's desire, and they're reacting to it.
[02:54:47.197 --> 02:54:47.858]  And they're wrong.
[02:54:47.858 --> 02:54:50.380]  They're making horrible mistakes.
[02:54:50.380 --> 02:54:54.945]  And again, the First Amendment, under fire, worse than I've ever seen it before.
[02:54:56.072 --> 02:55:00.059]  George, I know you've got to, you're already up, you've got to get ready for your own show tonight.
[02:55:00.059 --> 02:55:04.045]  That's midnight central, 10pm pacific, I guess 1am.
[02:55:05.922 --> 02:55:07.643]  New York time, I guess 11.
[02:55:07.643 --> 02:55:08.943]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:08.943 --> 02:55:13.104]  Yeah, so 11 at Night Mountain.
[02:55:13.104 --> 02:55:14.585]  What do you got coming up tonight?
[02:55:14.585 --> 02:55:21.927]  Because the mainstream media and the corporate system ignores talk radio, but talk radio is still gigantic and still has the biggest audiences.
[02:55:21.927 --> 02:55:27.629]  And they talk about somebody like Tucker Carlson, who's a great guy and a friend of mine, with 4 million viewers a night.
[02:55:27.629 --> 02:55:35.052]  You've got 6, 7, 8 million viewers a night and you never hear about it in corporate media because they're all, I think, really jealous of the power that talk radio still has.
[02:55:36.298 --> 02:55:45.620]  Well, what we're doing, and what we do on this program, Alex, since I took over from Mark Bell back in 2003, is I've added current events to the show.
[02:55:45.620 --> 02:55:54.502]  I mean, before Coast to Coast was primarily paranormal, ghosts, Bigfoot, UFOs, we still do all that.
[02:55:54.502 --> 02:55:57.183]  That has not gone away, and it's not going to go away.
[02:55:57.763 --> 02:56:03.526]  But we are doing current events now, alternative medicine, health issues, everything like that.
[02:56:03.526 --> 02:56:04.527]  And we're not going to stop.
[02:56:04.527 --> 02:56:08.169]  So we have a mix of everything that the world loves.
[02:56:08.169 --> 02:56:11.791]  And our audience and our affiliate base continues to grow.
[02:56:11.791 --> 02:56:12.331]  That's right.
[02:56:12.331 --> 02:56:13.712]  Theater of the mind.
[02:56:13.712 --> 02:56:21.756]  And while all other media is actually shrinking, because it's all fractured, when talk radio is done right, it's actually growing.
[02:56:21.756 --> 02:56:23.377]  And again, with all this censorship,
[02:56:24.673 --> 02:56:31.384]  Talk radio is more important than ever, and I just want people to understand that it's there.
[02:56:31.384 --> 02:56:34.509]  And you've also got a very wide internet platform.
[02:56:34.509 --> 02:56:36.232]  I know you're doing a lot of public speaking.
[02:56:36.232 --> 02:56:37.594]  I know you're also doing some TV shows.
[02:56:37.594 --> 02:56:38.555]  Tell us what else you're doing, George.
[02:56:39.608 --> 02:56:43.051]  Well, May 11th, I'll be live in Columbus, Ohio.
[02:56:43.051 --> 02:56:47.715]  For anybody from your audience that lives out that way, come to our live stage show.
[02:56:47.715 --> 02:56:52.058]  You can get full information on the Coast2CoastAM.com website.
[02:56:52.058 --> 02:56:57.983]  This coming Saturday, I'm in Everett, Washington near Seattle for a live sold-out show.
[02:56:57.983 --> 02:57:00.945]  I remember the one you and I did in Toronto, Alex.
[02:57:00.945 --> 02:57:02.386]  It was sold out.
[02:57:02.386 --> 02:57:06.770]  People went crazy when you came walking down the aisle with the spotlight on you.
[02:57:07.810 --> 02:57:16.975]  I think it's very important for talk hosts to see the public, to see their audience up front and personal, and that's what I keep doing around the country.
[02:57:16.975 --> 02:57:18.616]  I look forward to coming to another event soon.
[02:57:18.616 --> 02:57:21.378]  Say hi to the whole crew, and I'll say bye to you during the break.
[02:57:21.378 --> 02:57:22.499]  I'm going to host the fourth hour, folks.
[02:57:22.499 --> 02:57:26.941]  Stay with us, because they're having a studio problem at Hagman's operation, but that's okay.
[02:57:26.941 --> 02:57:28.842]  We're in the middle of the 50-hour broadcast.
[02:57:28.842 --> 02:57:30.203]  Only you can override the sensors.
[02:57:30.523 --> 02:57:37.168]  Whatever local stations you're listening to, however you're watching on the internet or listening, spread those links via text message and email and word of mouth.
[02:57:37.168 --> 02:57:38.349]  You are awesome.
[02:57:38.349 --> 02:57:40.230]  And thank you all for making the broadcast possible.
[02:57:40.230 --> 02:57:42.512]  And thank George Noria for all he's done for the broadcast as well.
[02:57:42.512 --> 02:57:45.174]  We'll be right back with our number four.
[02:57:45.174 --> 02:57:47.256]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[02:57:47.256 --> 02:57:47.556]  Go ahead.
[02:57:48.187 --> 02:57:50.109]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[02:57:50.109 --> 02:57:53.933]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[02:57:53.933 --> 02:57:55.374]  It just gets old, man.
[02:57:55.374 --> 02:57:57.796]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[02:57:57.796 --> 02:58:00.118]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[02:58:00.118 --> 02:58:04.122]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[02:58:04.122 --> 02:58:06.564]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[02:58:07.425 --> 02:58:10.107]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[02:58:10.107 --> 02:58:11.448]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[02:58:11.448 --> 02:58:12.568]  Us being shut down?
[02:58:12.568 --> 02:58:14.069]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[02:58:14.069 --> 02:58:15.130]  You know what, Alex?
[02:58:15.130 --> 02:58:16.230]  Put him on pause again.
[02:58:16.230 --> 02:58:17.331]  Hey, Frank!
[02:58:17.331 --> 02:58:22.994]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[02:58:22.994 --> 02:58:27.497]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[02:58:27.497 --> 02:58:30.639]  I'm not going to just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[02:58:30.639 --> 02:58:31.119]  You understand?
[02:58:31.119 --> 02:58:32.760]  I need your help, Frank!
[02:58:32.760 --> 02:58:33.881]  I need your help, Frank!

[02:58:40.464 --> 02:58:41.305]  Do you understand?

[02:58:42.825 --> 02:58:46.367]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[02:58:46.367 --> 02:58:49.469]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew they canned food.
[02:58:49.469 --> 02:58:52.371]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:58:52.371 --> 02:58:55.332]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:58:55.332 --> 02:58:59.895]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply with the top

[02:59:49.255 --> 02:59:51.898]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.721 --> 03:00:08.643]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[03:00:08.643 --> 03:00:10.604]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:10.604 --> 03:00:16.266]  Alright, they booked so many great guests on this show and then I open the phones up and I make a bunch of you hold because we got 20 phone lines.
[03:00:16.266 --> 03:00:17.707]  I apologize.
[03:00:17.707 --> 03:00:22.129]  That's just the nature of the beast to Dave and Shelly and Charity and Jessica and everybody.
[03:00:22.129 --> 03:00:24.190]  I'm gonna go to you all bam bam bam now.
[03:00:24.190 --> 03:00:25.610]  You got my promise here in the fourth hour.
[03:00:25.610 --> 03:00:26.271]  Thanks for tuning in.
[03:00:27.852 --> 03:00:29.395]  It's a free world world.
[03:00:29.395 --> 03:00:31.278]  Without you, we wouldn't be here.
[03:00:31.278 --> 03:00:33.281]  Without each other, none of us would be here.
[03:00:33.281 --> 03:00:34.043]  Dave in Chile.
[03:00:34.043 --> 03:00:35.204]  I didn't see you were calling from Chile.
[03:00:35.204 --> 03:00:36.386]  I would have gone to you earlier.
[03:00:36.386 --> 03:00:37.488]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:00:37.488 --> 03:00:37.749]  Welcome.
[03:00:38.706 --> 03:00:45.130]  Well, I'd like to say that this telephone call is brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:00:45.130 --> 03:00:57.977]  Anyway, apart from that, I got an email from the camera, well, the deputies, basically your representatives in Chile.
[03:00:57.977 --> 03:01:08.043]  And this is from the Communist Party, and it's talking about the meeting, not with Trump, but with Piñera and Bolsonaro.
[03:01:08.972 --> 03:01:19.210]  Uh, from Brazil, and she starts off her email with, uh, getting together today with Bolsonaro is like getting together with Hitler in 1936.
[03:01:22.575 --> 03:01:26.437]  I mean, it's just incredible what they talk about sometimes.
[03:01:26.437 --> 03:01:32.979]  I have no idea why this person seems to think that Jair Bolsonaro is like that.
[03:01:32.979 --> 03:01:35.640]  I mean, he seems to be a pretty straightforward guy.
[03:01:35.640 --> 03:01:37.341]  He's not a crazy guy.
[03:01:37.341 --> 03:01:44.584]  He's not telling gays that, no, you can't live, or anything like that.
[03:01:44.584 --> 03:01:50.246]  No, he's straight up... All Bolsonaro said is men shouldn't be peeing in each other's mouths in the middle of the street in front of children.
[03:01:51.271 --> 03:01:51.971]  Yeah.
[03:01:51.971 --> 03:01:56.794]  I mean, literally, because he said that he's a bad guy, and I talk about that on air, that's what's going on here.
[03:01:56.794 --> 03:02:01.017]  Look, they don't want leaders that care about the people that want prosperity.
[03:02:01.017 --> 03:02:05.960]  They want global corporations and follower leaders so they can suck the public dry.
[03:02:05.960 --> 03:02:08.641]  They want a bunch of broken people they can control.
[03:02:08.641 --> 03:02:13.004]  And once you see things from the cold-blooded, psychotic perspective of these mega corporations,
[03:02:14.426 --> 03:02:17.427]  Again, we're Bayer Pharmaceutical that bought Monsanto.
[03:02:17.427 --> 03:02:26.531]  It came out in the court documents, even NBC News had the documents, back when they were somewhat decent 15 years ago, and said, there's too many hemophiliacs.
[03:02:26.531 --> 03:02:28.912]  So what if all the blood's contaminated with HIV?
[03:02:28.912 --> 03:02:30.733]  Let them die.
[03:02:30.733 --> 03:02:32.714]  Now, the average person, like,
[03:02:33.866 --> 03:02:35.647]  By the way, Bolsonaro's birthday is today.
[03:03:04.264 --> 03:03:07.705]  Well, happy birthday, President Bolsonaro.
[03:03:07.705 --> 03:03:09.446]  Anyway, that's all I've got to say.
[03:03:09.446 --> 03:03:13.107]  Thanks very much for having me on and go on to the next call.
[03:03:13.107 --> 03:03:14.167]  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[03:03:14.167 --> 03:03:14.467]  All right.
[03:03:14.467 --> 03:03:15.387]  God bless you, Dave.
[03:03:15.387 --> 03:03:17.448]  Thanks for putting up with me.
[03:03:17.448 --> 03:03:21.149]  You know, I've told the folks that take the calls, we don't really screen them.
[03:03:21.149 --> 03:03:29.851]  Maybe we should just like keep six phone lines and just cap it because then it is the frustration is.
[03:03:29.851 --> 03:03:31.112]  What was it a few years ago we had?
[03:03:33.853 --> 03:03:37.256]  24,000 phone calls in three hours.
[03:03:37.256 --> 03:03:41.479]  Now, a lot of those people calling over and over again, but nobody's got.
[03:03:41.479 --> 03:03:43.200]  And my memory isn't perfect anymore.
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:46.502]  Well, somebody asked Wes, was it 23 or 26?
[03:03:46.502 --> 03:03:48.003]  What was the record number of phone calls?
[03:03:48.003 --> 03:03:50.825]  We have a digital system.
[03:03:50.825 --> 03:03:50.985]  20, 26,000.
[03:03:50.985 --> 03:03:56.269]  26,000 phone calls.
[03:03:56.269 --> 03:04:00.292]  And so, I'm thinking I wanna have a radio network
[03:04:01.690 --> 03:04:15.880]  The shows I want are going to be clip shows, where we play clips of interesting news for like an hour, and then we take calls for an hour and really get to a bunch of them, and then clips, and then maybe a guest.
[03:04:15.880 --> 03:04:20.903]  And I'm working on getting the host, I'm working on getting the board ops and the producers and the crew in, but that's really going to be the model.
[03:04:20.903 --> 03:04:27.768]  But I have to lead by leadership, by example, and I've got to just basically get the model of, maybe we have one guest on,
[03:04:29.212 --> 03:04:34.356]  And then we have an hour of calls, and we have an hour of clips or something, because it's just, it's just, it's just incredible.
[03:04:34.356 --> 03:04:36.378]  We're gonna go to break, come right back with your calls.
[03:04:36.378 --> 03:04:49.688]  Charity, Jessica, Sean, Randy, Lucas, Jeff, Matthew, Lee, Dustin, we'll go in the order your calls come in.
[03:04:49.688 --> 03:04:50.529]  Please stay with us.
[03:04:50.529 --> 03:04:54.152]  God bless.
[03:04:54.152 --> 03:04:55.533]  I've got some really good news, though.
[03:04:56.645 --> 03:04:58.006]  X2's back.
[03:04:58.006 --> 03:04:59.768]  The original X2.
[03:04:59.768 --> 03:05:00.729]  Deep Earth Crystal.
[03:05:00.729 --> 03:05:02.670]  Pure atomic iodine.
[03:05:02.670 --> 03:05:03.771]  What you want.
[03:05:03.771 --> 03:05:04.892]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:04.892 --> 03:05:06.313]  It'll be here in a week.
[03:05:06.313 --> 03:05:07.874]  Manufactured in the U.S.
[03:05:07.874 --> 03:05:08.855]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:08.855 --> 03:05:10.657]  With the best iodine in the world.
[03:05:10.657 --> 03:05:11.798]  X2 is available.
[03:05:11.798 --> 03:05:12.778]  I thought X3's great.
[03:05:12.778 --> 03:05:14.980]  We still got another Deep Earth Crystal source.
[03:05:14.980 --> 03:05:16.802]  But I thought, add the other two types of iodine.
[03:05:16.802 --> 03:05:17.703]  The scientists that do that.
[03:05:17.703 --> 03:05:19.964]  It's sold a lot, but people want original X2.
[03:05:20.785 --> 03:05:25.167]  Well, I was resigned to the fact that we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago.
[03:05:25.167 --> 03:05:29.248]  We now have X2 again, and in FullWorthStore.com, so hallelujah!
[03:05:29.248 --> 03:05:40.953]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2, develop it again, and we were able to do the exact same formula.
[03:05:40.953 --> 03:05:49.556]  If you want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it, learn about how the other iodines are bound,
[03:05:50.569 --> 03:06:03.673]  Get yours today at mfulworthstore.com or mfulworthslife.com.
[03:06:03.673 --> 03:06:09.655]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:36.610 --> 03:06:40.751]  Song about Fort Detrick, Maryland.
[03:06:40.751 --> 03:06:44.851]  You know how I know?
[03:06:44.851 --> 03:06:47.172]  That I clutched on one time.
[03:06:47.172 --> 03:06:50.632]  I got a bunch of incredible
[03:07:06.377 --> 03:07:08.979]  Clips and news to break down, but I'm taking your calls right now.
[03:07:08.979 --> 03:07:14.022]  At the bottom of the hour, I'll get to Brett Hume admitting the Democrats have declared a secret national emergency.
[03:07:14.022 --> 03:07:15.823]  Ooh, where'd you hear that?
[03:07:15.823 --> 03:07:17.364]  And I didn't just think that up.
[03:07:17.364 --> 03:07:18.284]  I've studied the U.S.
[03:07:18.284 --> 03:07:24.808]  Code, COG, and I don't think Trump understood it.
[03:07:24.808 --> 03:07:32.953]  And that's why they wanted to shut down more than anything, was we were getting messages to Trump about
[03:07:33.956 --> 03:07:42.262]  The National Emergency, and he's declared the National Emergency because you have to declare one to overwrite the last according to federal law.
[03:07:42.262 --> 03:07:44.144]  And that's why they're so pissed.
[03:07:44.144 --> 03:07:51.029]  Yeah, it has to do with the border and the wall, but that's only the vehicle for Trump to be able to fire whoever he wants.
[03:07:51.029 --> 03:07:58.335]  Like Ronald Reagan, when the air traffic controllers say, we're not going to let planes fly, he says, you're fired if you don't.
[03:07:58.335 --> 03:08:02.618]  But by the way, I order you back to work under agreements you signed under National Emergency.
[03:08:06.311 --> 03:08:09.413]  Or you're gonna be criminally charged because you signed up for that?
[03:08:09.413 --> 03:08:10.553]  You're in a critical infrastructure?
[03:08:10.553 --> 03:08:14.476]  It's like saying you agree to be a paramedic.
[03:08:14.476 --> 03:08:17.598]  Unless you got the flu or something and you're signed on, you're gonna just not show up to work?
[03:08:17.598 --> 03:08:21.180]  People are gonna, you know, die on the side of the road?
[03:08:21.180 --> 03:08:22.520]  You're like, that's authoritarianism.
[03:08:22.520 --> 03:08:24.982]  Well, airplanes crashing out of the sky is authoritarianism too, isn't it?
[03:08:26.812 --> 03:08:31.233]  So, we're not the ones that put all these emergencies in place, but we're trying to get rid of them.
[03:08:31.233 --> 03:08:35.215]  And you get rid of an emergency with an emergency, because that's how the law's written.
[03:08:35.215 --> 03:08:40.916]  They tried to spin that all day that, oh, Jones wants martial law and tanks in the street.
[03:08:40.916 --> 03:08:43.777]  It's the Democrats who want tanks in the street.
[03:08:43.777 --> 03:08:44.978]  Trump wants jobs in the street.
[03:08:44.978 --> 03:08:51.019]  And I'm still a huge supporter of Trump, but we're not going to get him to move against the censors without getting in his face.
[03:08:51.019 --> 03:08:52.720]  He doesn't respect anything else.
[03:08:54.338 --> 03:09:02.305]  We've got a rampage through the advisors he's got trying to cover this up and we're already getting major success in his statements and what he's doing.
[03:09:02.305 --> 03:09:04.487]  And I got a bunch of clips I haven't got to on that front.
[03:09:04.487 --> 03:09:07.810]  Attorney Generals in Louisiana and other areas are getting ready to go after Big Tech.
[03:09:07.810 --> 03:09:14.095]  So it's on, like they say, like Donkey Kong, nice cheesy 80s statement.
[03:09:14.095 --> 03:09:17.798]  Who's been holding the very longest?
[03:09:17.798 --> 03:09:19.159]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[03:09:21.812 --> 03:09:24.654]  Charity in Pennsylvania, then we'll go to Jeff in Canada.
[03:09:24.654 --> 03:09:27.196]  Charity, thanks for calling.
[03:09:27.196 --> 03:09:29.398]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[03:09:29.398 --> 03:09:31.119]  Thank you.
[03:09:31.119 --> 03:09:38.084]  I was calling to discuss and get your perspective on the church's role with the abortion issue now.
[03:09:38.084 --> 03:09:51.174]  I feel as though for so long the issue has been sort of out of sight, out of mind with the churches, meaning there wasn't really an expose of all that were going on in the abortion clinics and now that we have all of these
[03:09:51.844 --> 03:09:59.292]  Well, Charity, I'm glad you held for an hour and 31 minutes to say that because it's the most important thing said here in probably a year.
[03:10:15.373 --> 03:10:16.634]  And when I wake up at 3 a.m.
[03:10:16.634 --> 03:10:31.420]  and the Spirit, you know, is with me and I'm in that quiet place, the Most High, that King David talked about, it's go on air and convict the churches and be calm and be focused and talk about their role and that's what you're supposed to do.
[03:10:31.420 --> 03:10:39.244]  And I get obsessed with news and information and worldly stuff that's important but still not the Spirit's key.
[03:10:39.244 --> 03:10:41.705]  It's a whole history, ma'am, and you know this.
[03:10:41.705 --> 03:10:43.666]  Most churches aren't led by bad men and women.
[03:10:44.986 --> 03:10:46.231]  They told him in the 50s.
[03:10:46.231 --> 03:10:47.415]  Oh, it's just a form you sign.
[03:10:48.843 --> 03:10:52.326]  Through the ecumenical movement that, oh, you're a charity now.
[03:10:52.326 --> 03:10:52.646]  Well, no.
[03:10:52.646 --> 03:11:04.134]  Under the First Amendment, Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or the right of the press, or the right of the people to peacefully assemble for redress of grievances.
[03:11:04.134 --> 03:11:09.798]  People think of free speech as government funding, you know, gay guys peeing on a crucifix for $100,000.
[03:11:09.798 --> 03:11:11.739]  That's blasphemy.
[03:11:11.739 --> 03:11:15.101]  First Amendment says Congress has no jurisdiction.
[03:11:15.101 --> 03:11:17.143]  Government has no jurisdiction over religion.
[03:11:18.103 --> 03:11:23.545]  That's how Hopi Indians can take peyote, because Congress and government has no jurisdiction over it.
[03:11:24.827 --> 03:11:26.348]  Now, you may disagree with people taking peyote.
[03:11:26.348 --> 03:11:29.330]  The point is, that's how powerful religious rights are.
[03:11:29.330 --> 03:11:34.612]  So they trick the churches into becoming 501c3 charitable organizations.
[03:11:34.612 --> 03:11:38.435]  Then they tell them, you can't be political if you're under this.
[03:11:38.435 --> 03:11:46.039]  So I go to these big megachurches, and some of them are real nice, and they're uplifting, and it's positive, and it's more of like a, you know, upbeat deal.
[03:11:46.039 --> 03:11:49.341]  Others you go, it's all leftist and Bill and Melinda Gates propaganda.
[03:11:50.185 --> 03:11:58.329]  But they believe that we're going to turn people off to Christ if we don't give them a soft, cotton candy existence.
[03:11:58.329 --> 03:12:00.290]  Well, we've lost the country with that.
[03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:18.120]  And so you go, and I can meet these preachers for dinner privately, they know all the stuff that's going on, they're tough guys, they're good-looking veterans, they're everything, but at the end of the day, they don't have the leadership because they think they've got big jumbo TVs and, you know, celebrity guests coming in to talk, and it's all about
[03:12:18.979 --> 03:12:20.620]  How big the megachurch is.
[03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:29.007]  When if you have churches that really get in there and talk about the devil and the attack on the family and the system, people are ready to take action.
[03:12:29.007 --> 03:12:30.448]  They're ready to get serious.
[03:12:30.448 --> 03:12:31.909]  They're ready for the church to lead us out of this.
[03:12:31.909 --> 03:12:32.890]  So these aren't churches.
[03:12:33.820 --> 03:12:36.862]  These are Oprah Winfrey's secret centers.
[03:12:36.862 --> 03:12:40.804]  She's running a big church in Africa right now, by the way, putting her money in it, so it's tax-free.
[03:12:40.804 --> 03:12:42.645]  Where they just sit there and make everybody feel good.
[03:12:42.645 --> 03:12:44.766]  Yeah, where are the churches?
[03:12:44.766 --> 03:12:47.107]  Well, they say, talk about abortion, it's political.
[03:12:47.107 --> 03:12:52.150]  But then all the other leftist churches are saying, vote for AOC and vote for Pocahontas.
[03:12:53.599 --> 03:12:54.680]  Beto O'Rourke.
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:12:57.263]  So, those aren't churches.
[03:12:57.263 --> 03:13:01.567]  They are... Why did Christ not go preach at the synagogues?
[03:13:01.567 --> 03:13:04.270]  He said, that's a bunch of Pharisees, how they're all high and mighty.
[03:13:04.270 --> 03:13:05.531]  They're just making money off tithes.
[03:13:06.587 --> 03:13:08.108]  He beat him with whips.
[03:13:08.108 --> 03:13:17.115]  He was hanging out with prostitutes and tax collectors and fishermen and cobblers and people that made cabinets.
[03:13:17.115 --> 03:13:19.237]  Because they were real people and they'd listen.
[03:13:19.237 --> 03:13:23.220]  They weren't in religion to be powerful and to spew guilt.
[03:13:23.900 --> 03:13:28.403]  And so Christ, who was perfect, was going to the imperfect because at least they had soft hearts.
[03:13:28.403 --> 03:13:36.488]  They weren't the Pharisees praying up on a hilltop so everybody could see, the Pharisee and Sadducee, with all their law and all their legalese and their cult.
[03:13:36.488 --> 03:13:40.991]  He was looking for people that were really lost, not people that were posing.
[03:13:40.991 --> 03:13:41.352]  And so...
[03:13:42.759 --> 03:13:43.319]  We should.
[03:13:43.319 --> 03:13:51.465]  You should try to get up in front of your church and bring up the governor saying we kill babies after they're born and get into bioethics and how they're doing it.
[03:13:51.465 --> 03:13:59.690]  You know, you should, your husband, whoever, or start your own church, whatever, start your own website, because we have to come out of Babylon.
[03:13:59.690 --> 03:14:04.674]  That doesn't mean I'm perfect or, you know, doesn't mean I don't drink a beer, doesn't mean I don't eat too much or whatever.
[03:14:04.674 --> 03:14:07.335]  The point is, is that I still love God and love children.
[03:14:07.335 --> 03:14:08.696]  And you judge a tree by its fruits.
[03:14:08.696 --> 03:14:12.079]  And if you're not standing up for unborn children and now born children,
[03:14:12.819 --> 03:14:24.194]  And if you're not standing up against devil worship being taught to children, and if you're not standing up against world government and open evil, then you know that you're not on the right path and you're not with God.
[03:14:24.194 --> 03:14:28.199]  And God's going to say to these church leaders, I don't know you, just go away from me.
[03:14:28.199 --> 03:14:29.982]  Because they're not putting skin in the game.
[03:14:31.328 --> 03:14:35.210]  They're trying to create, oh, the whole world's going to end anyways.
[03:14:35.210 --> 03:14:37.451]  This is a modern ecumenical thing of the last hundred years.
[03:14:37.451 --> 03:14:42.534]  So let's just get people in here so they're not in the world, so that, you know, we save them.
[03:14:42.534 --> 03:14:50.859]  No, you just brought the world into the church, so they're not going to recognize the difference between the world and the church, and God's Spirit isn't going to be in that church.
[03:14:50.859 --> 03:14:54.361]  It's going to be a bunch of feel-good, synthetic garbage.
[03:14:54.361 --> 03:14:58.023]  And so we're going to lose all these people because of it, and it's the devil's plan.
[03:14:58.023 --> 03:14:59.644]  What do you think of that answer?
[03:15:01.048 --> 03:15:02.129]  I agree with you 100%.
[03:15:02.129 --> 03:15:10.137]  A friend once told me, and I've often say that the purpose of the church is to build Christ's kingdom, not our kingdom.
[03:15:10.137 --> 03:15:18.425]  And I feel like so many people, and I'm not trying to bash the church, it is good, but I feel that they've gotten caught up.
[03:15:18.425 --> 03:15:21.808]  They're so concerned about building their programs when now we have a clear
[03:15:22.725 --> 03:15:28.628]  line that's been drawn where people are saying, no, we want to kill children, you know, full term.
[03:15:28.628 --> 03:15:30.628]  They don't want to, Charity.
[03:15:30.628 --> 03:15:31.829]  They're doing it.
[03:15:31.829 --> 03:15:32.709]  Right, exactly.
[03:15:32.709 --> 03:15:40.432]  And now they're having programs where they want to defile and ruin small children.
[03:15:40.432 --> 03:15:42.493]  They want to completely destroy.
[03:15:42.493 --> 03:15:42.933]  Exactly.
[03:15:42.933 --> 03:15:45.735]  Evil has come out of its burrows like a plague.
[03:15:45.735 --> 03:15:48.636]  Where is the spirit of the Lord to lift the standard against it?
[03:15:48.636 --> 03:15:51.077]  If the churches don't lift the standard now, they're of the devil.
[03:15:53.157 --> 03:15:55.778]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.
[03:15:55.778 --> 03:15:56.878]  Get back to nature.

[03:16:53.044 --> 03:16:54.266]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.266 --> 03:16:58.190]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.190 --> 03:16:59.731]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:59.731 --> 03:17:02.694]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.694 --> 03:17:07.900]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:18:54.236 --> 03:19:02.622]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[03:19:02.622 --> 03:19:04.083]  Believe me, I know.
[03:19:04.083 --> 03:19:08.386]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[03:19:08.386 --> 03:19:11.848]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[03:19:12.328 --> 03:19:14.030]  I still have that energy.
[03:19:14.030 --> 03:19:34.171]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[03:19:50.083 --> 03:19:51.424]  Supermail Vitality.
[03:19:51.424 --> 03:19:57.168]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:19:57.168 --> 03:19:59.830]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:26.181 --> 03:20:27.727]  The great Dwight Yoakam bringing us in.
[03:20:27.727 --> 03:20:30.597]  I'm gonna go right back to your phone calls, but let me just recap what I was saying earlier.
[03:20:31.761 --> 03:20:32.541]  I'm not perfect.
[03:20:32.541 --> 03:20:33.682]  I'm not judging anybody.
[03:20:33.682 --> 03:20:37.323]  If you love God and you love justice, you're still going to do some bad things.
[03:20:37.323 --> 03:20:38.083]  We're all sinners.
[03:20:38.083 --> 03:20:43.125]  But these modern churches have signed contracts with the devil.
[03:20:43.125 --> 03:20:45.206]  501c3 since the 50s.
[03:20:45.206 --> 03:20:46.867]  And churches are under the First Amendment.
[03:20:46.867 --> 03:20:48.788]  They shouldn't be under that system.
[03:20:48.788 --> 03:20:50.228]  They got tricked to be under it.
[03:20:50.228 --> 03:20:52.589]  There's a lot of good churches that are still 501c3.
[03:20:52.589 --> 03:20:53.569]  God judges the spirit.
[03:20:53.569 --> 03:20:55.470]  And you know, the heart.
[03:20:55.470 --> 03:21:00.192]  But if you ask what's going on, you go to a big church, you feel the spirit of God because there's good people there.
[03:21:01.957 --> 03:21:11.601]  But when the preachers are up there, got you in a holding pattern, so that you never go out on the streets and do anything, it's not good.
[03:21:11.601 --> 03:21:16.063]  Or they'll send the young people out to hand out stuff about the church and proselytize.
[03:21:16.063 --> 03:21:22.365]  And it's more like, I look at the men at these mega churches, they're more like cheerleaders, they're like jumping up and down, it's more like a football game.
[03:21:22.365 --> 03:21:24.786]  And this isn't a football game.
[03:21:24.786 --> 03:21:27.908]  You think they'd be aborting babies after they're born?
[03:21:27.908 --> 03:21:30.929]  All over the country and passing laws to do it if the churches weren't captured?
[03:21:33.194 --> 03:21:36.477]  So, that's where I stand.
[03:21:36.477 --> 03:21:46.267]  And again, it's not about me up here on some high horse, that I'm this big mortal guy, and that's why I stand up for babies not getting killed.
[03:21:46.267 --> 03:21:48.149]  That's dangerous, folks.
[03:21:48.149 --> 03:21:50.392]  You think the rest of us are going to be safe?
[03:21:50.392 --> 03:21:52.314]  If they can kill kids after they're born, what about old people?
[03:21:52.314 --> 03:21:53.215]  They're already killing them now.
[03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:55.428]  Look all over the world, they got euthanasia.
[03:21:55.428 --> 03:22:02.730]  By the way, that's different than if you've got terminal cancer and you don't want treatment or you want a bunch of, you know, heroin to get you out of it quicker.
[03:22:02.730 --> 03:22:04.790]  I'm not judging people.
[03:22:04.790 --> 03:22:06.871]  But see, how about the state killing you?
[03:22:06.871 --> 03:22:09.611]  And I'm not saying suicide's good either.
[03:22:09.611 --> 03:22:12.092]  It's just that I understand somebody that wants to get out of their misery.
[03:22:12.092 --> 03:22:13.792]  I don't judge them.
[03:22:13.792 --> 03:22:18.513]  You know, back when I was a teenager and stuff, I was totally against assisted suicide because I knew the state would get involved.
[03:22:19.397 --> 03:22:26.460]  But then as I grew up and got older, I realized the state wants to assist in suicide because they want to kill you and get your money.
[03:22:26.460 --> 03:22:28.120]  They do that definitely in Northern Europe.
[03:22:28.120 --> 03:22:43.346]  But then I had a lot of friends I knew, quite a few friends, veterans and doctors and family friends that, you know, they'd get kidney cancer or they'd get liver cancer or they'd get bone cancer and, man, it'd be hurting real bad and they didn't want to spend all their family's money and they'd just shove a .45 in their mouth and blow their brains all over the wall.
[03:22:45.069 --> 03:22:46.130]  And you can't not say.
[03:22:46.130 --> 03:22:47.890]  They're not being wimps.
[03:22:47.890 --> 03:22:51.252]  They're keeping their family from the expenses.
[03:22:51.252 --> 03:22:53.133]  And I'm not saying do that either.
[03:22:53.133 --> 03:22:57.415]  I'm just saying the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[03:22:57.415 --> 03:22:59.376]  And I'm not going to judge people that have had abortions.
[03:22:59.376 --> 03:23:01.097]  You got lied into it.
[03:23:01.097 --> 03:23:02.558]  It was the wrong thing to do.
[03:23:02.558 --> 03:23:04.959]  But as long as you say it's wrong and repent, God loves you.
[03:23:06.357 --> 03:23:10.019]  But if you turn it into a sacrament and love it, then God hates you.
[03:23:10.019 --> 03:23:16.864]  And I'm not going to judge anybody I've known because I've had a lot of people I loved and care about that killed themselves.
[03:23:16.864 --> 03:23:19.065]  I'll never intend to kill myself.
[03:23:19.065 --> 03:23:22.167]  I tend to go on as long as I can, but I never want to kill myself.
[03:23:22.167 --> 03:23:28.371]  I never had those desires, but I've known a lot of good people who were in a lot of pain, killed themselves a lot.
[03:23:28.371 --> 03:23:31.973]  And you can't blame somebody wanting to get out of pain.
[03:23:35.261 --> 03:23:40.844]  And the reason I'm going down that road is God judges the heart.
[03:23:40.844 --> 03:23:44.566]  And the devil knows how to manipulate us and go, oh, look, you did this or you did that.
[03:23:44.566 --> 03:23:45.506]  You're not perfect.
[03:23:45.506 --> 03:23:47.147]  So don't tell me.
[03:23:47.147 --> 03:23:48.108]  Well, here's the deal.
[03:23:48.108 --> 03:23:52.210]  We're not perfect, but we don't want to kill babies after they're born or before they're born.
[03:23:52.210 --> 03:23:53.370]  And we know the larger agenda.
[03:23:53.370 --> 03:23:54.391]  That's all I'm getting at here.
[03:23:54.391 --> 03:23:55.091]  That's all I'm getting at.
[03:23:55.091 --> 03:23:56.192]  Let's go back to the calls.
[03:23:56.192 --> 03:23:59.873]  I'm ranting here.
[03:23:59.873 --> 03:24:01.094]  I've been to so many churches.
[03:24:04.975 --> 03:24:07.696]  So many churches.
[03:24:07.696 --> 03:24:14.537]  And they're just feel-good institutions.
[03:24:14.537 --> 03:24:22.479]  And you go to these big churches in Texas, and it's all about how great Texas is, and they'll have some football player come in and talk.
[03:24:22.479 --> 03:24:25.720]  Everybody's like, ooh, look, that's the quarterback from whatever.
[03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:31.962]  And that's great, I guess, to make people's identity God, so you show a bunch of famous people to think that's God's identity.
[03:24:31.962 --> 03:24:32.862]  God's identity
[03:24:33.954 --> 03:24:40.597]  is building things and founding things and doing things and paying for something.
[03:24:40.597 --> 03:24:41.878]  Christ is the ultimate example of that.
[03:24:41.878 --> 03:24:43.059]  And all the prophets.
[03:24:43.059 --> 03:24:44.279]  Let me tell you something.
[03:24:44.279 --> 03:24:45.340]  Nothing worth anything is free.
[03:24:45.340 --> 03:24:47.581]  Everybody knows it.
[03:24:47.581 --> 03:24:56.585]  And if you think we're going to get taken to heaven on a bed of roses or on a bed of feathers, you got nothing coming.
[03:24:56.585 --> 03:24:57.526]  It's going to take blood.
[03:24:57.526 --> 03:24:58.346]  It's going to take sweat.
[03:24:58.346 --> 03:24:59.107]  It's going to take tears.
[03:24:59.107 --> 03:25:00.027]  But let me tell you something.
[03:25:00.027 --> 03:25:03.329]  Through the blood, sweat, and tears, you're going to find ecstasy.
[03:25:04.531 --> 03:25:06.631]  And it's not that you're even into pain.
[03:25:06.631 --> 03:25:10.152]  It's that you're into overcoming the enemy's will.
[03:25:10.152 --> 03:25:19.034]  And the more you stand against the enemy and spread your sails inter-dimensionally for God, the more God blows life into you.
[03:25:19.034 --> 03:25:22.955]  Like Genesis says, through God's nostrils breathe life into the planet.
[03:25:22.955 --> 03:25:27.536]  You can literally feel God's spirit like a wind.
[03:25:27.536 --> 03:25:30.557]  And right when the enemy hits, you're like, this is not fun.
[03:25:30.557 --> 03:25:33.138]  All of a sudden you feel God back you up.
[03:25:33.138 --> 03:25:33.718]  It's like, whoa.
[03:25:34.935 --> 03:25:39.137]  And the worse the enemy gets, the more you can see Satan, the more you can see God.
[03:25:39.137 --> 03:25:45.840]  The more you feel the enemy, the more you see how fallen they are, the more you think, God, you know God's real, and God's right there with you.
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:50.301]  And you think about people that never had the experience of being close to God, and how horrible that must be to be cut off from God.
[03:25:50.301 --> 03:25:52.382]  Alright, I'm sorry, I'm ranting.
[03:25:52.382 --> 03:25:54.143]  I'm being a bad person.
[03:25:54.143 --> 03:25:56.264]  Who'd I say was up next here is no longer.
[03:26:01.954 --> 03:26:04.776]  Jeff in Canada and then we'll go to Lucas and Randy and everybody else.
[03:26:04.776 --> 03:26:07.037]  Go ahead.
[03:26:07.037 --> 03:26:08.879]  Hey Alex, fantastic show today.
[03:26:08.879 --> 03:26:11.701]  Really appreciate you highlighting the abortion issue.
[03:26:11.701 --> 03:26:13.542]  It's the critical issue of our time.
[03:26:13.542 --> 03:26:21.027]  It's the issue of humankind and the devil wants our children.
[03:26:21.027 --> 03:26:21.587]  Exactly.
[03:26:21.587 --> 03:26:25.830]  If we turn away from this, what else can we turn away from except faith in God?
[03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:31.674]  So I just want to answer what this lady or give a suggestion what this lady, this last lady who called
[03:26:32.210 --> 03:26:37.332]  Yeah, it's picking out these minuscule things and just forgetting about the main issues of our day.
[03:26:55.547 --> 03:27:07.236]  And anyway, I just wanted to put it out there to really simplify the argument and to really expose the hypocrisy and the pinnacle of irony of pro-abortion people.
[03:27:07.236 --> 03:27:11.079]  Look them in the eye, eyeball to eyeball, and ask them one question.
[03:27:11.079 --> 03:27:13.681]  Do you wish you would have been aborted?
[03:27:13.681 --> 03:27:14.902]  And just let them stew on that.
[03:27:14.902 --> 03:27:22.829]  Let them squirm and let them answer that to you, because 99% of them are going to say, you know, I want to live.
[03:27:22.829 --> 03:27:24.530]  And if you can't extend that
[03:27:25.493 --> 03:27:25.833]  I think
[03:27:46.939 --> 03:27:56.464]  People like Benjamin Franklin, people like... I mean, nobody went through the kind of stuff that became as famous as he did as somebody like Andrew Jackson.
[03:27:56.464 --> 03:28:01.606]  They didn't take what bad would happen to them and make it their weakness, they made it their strength.
[03:28:01.606 --> 03:28:10.330]  And so, so many of the people that are in wheelchairs or that have diseases that would be aborted because of their genetics, that's where this is all going, they're our best people.
[03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:14.296]  And so these adversities are not plagues.
[03:28:14.296 --> 03:28:18.583]  Many of these adversities, if we overcome them, are our strengths.
[03:28:18.583 --> 03:28:19.605]  Exactly.
[03:28:19.605 --> 03:28:24.533]  And I think what we need to do is put a camera in front of these people's faces and ask them the question.
[03:28:24.533 --> 03:28:24.814]  Veto.
[03:28:25.666 --> 03:28:27.987]  Would have you wanted to be aborted when you were a child?
[03:28:27.987 --> 03:28:28.668]  It's a genius.
[03:28:28.668 --> 03:28:29.488]  I'm gonna do it.
[03:28:29.488 --> 03:28:30.749]  I want everyone to go out.
[03:28:30.749 --> 03:28:31.889]  Go to Beto.
[03:28:31.889 --> 03:28:32.930]  Millie Weaver's on fire.
[03:28:32.930 --> 03:28:33.490]  We'll send her.
[03:28:33.490 --> 03:28:34.151]  Caitlin Bennett.
[03:28:34.151 --> 03:28:35.511]  Go ask Beto.
[03:28:35.511 --> 03:28:37.472]  Do you wish your mother would have aborted you?
[03:28:37.472 --> 03:28:38.653]  Total genius!
[03:28:38.653 --> 03:28:39.774]  Thanks for holding an hour and a half.
[03:28:39.774 --> 03:28:40.414]  You have to say that.
[03:28:40.414 --> 03:28:41.515]  We salute you.
[03:28:41.515 --> 03:28:44.516]  Coming up next, I'm gonna rampage through these calls.
[03:28:44.516 --> 03:28:49.859]  Jessica and Lucas and Sean.
[03:28:49.859 --> 03:28:50.719]  Everybody's been holding on.
[03:28:50.719 --> 03:28:51.480]  We'll get everybody straight ahead.
[03:28:53.200 --> 03:28:56.762]  The pain in my neck, back, and shoulders has really gotten worse.
[03:28:56.762 --> 03:29:00.345]  Relief for body pain is here with Sunny Bay Heating Pads.
[03:29:00.345 --> 03:29:02.466]  Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill.
[03:29:02.466 --> 03:29:04.507]  So what's so good about Sunny Bay Heating Pads?
[03:29:04.507 --> 03:29:10.271]  Sunny Bay Heating Pads, made by Biomed DB Design, right here in the USA, come in all sizes.

[03:30:05.841 --> 03:30:07.082]  You are the InfoWard.
[03:30:07.082 --> 03:30:10.145]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[03:30:24.498 --> 03:30:35.885]  Let everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the census can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:30:35.885 --> 03:30:43.869]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[03:30:43.869 --> 03:30:50.913]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:30:50.913 --> 03:30:53.655]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[03:30:59.113 --> 03:31:01.454]  The Real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:31:01.454 --> 03:31:04.895]  Our team is constantly on the lookout for newer and better ways to improve our products.

[03:31:53.760 --> 03:31:58.384]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:31:58.384 --> 03:32:02.648]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:32:02.648 --> 03:32:10.596]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:32:10.596 --> 03:32:13.698]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:32:13.698 --> 03:32:17.202]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:32:18.511 --> 03:32:21.652]  And what we say and what we do that changes the world.
[03:32:21.652 --> 03:32:23.692]  We are the power structure.
[03:32:23.692 --> 03:32:25.293]  We are the inventors.
[03:32:25.293 --> 03:32:27.073]  We are the trailblazers.
[03:32:27.073 --> 03:32:30.474]  And the globalists understand that.
[03:32:30.474 --> 03:32:37.575]  And they understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we, the people.
[03:32:37.575 --> 03:32:41.396]  Now, to help fund our operation that is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalists,
[03:32:42.424 --> 03:32:56.651]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at m4store.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[03:32:56.651 --> 03:32:59.293]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:09.815 --> 03:33:14.738]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:33:14.738 --> 03:33:16.660]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:16.660 --> 03:33:20.262]  Our love is unconditional.
[03:33:20.262 --> 03:33:23.745]  We knew it from the start.
[03:33:23.745 --> 03:33:26.887]  I see it in your eyes.
[03:33:26.887 --> 03:33:31.450]  You can feel it from my heart.
[03:33:31.450 --> 03:33:38.034]  From here on after, let's stay the way we are right now.
[03:33:38.034 --> 03:33:39.155]  And share all the love
[03:33:41.766 --> 03:33:47.351]  Welcome back folks, Alex Jones here.
[03:33:47.351 --> 03:33:52.095]  I don't want to explain this.
[03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:02.110]  We're going to go to your calls.
[03:34:02.110 --> 03:34:20.537]  It is not heroic to stand up and speak out and say that convicted pedophiles should not be at public schools and elementary schools and toddler events, telling kids to touch their butts and their faces and admittedly trying to corrupt them in their own admissions.
[03:34:20.537 --> 03:34:24.738]  It's not heroic to say we shouldn't kill babies after they're born.
[03:34:24.738 --> 03:34:28.300]  It's not heroic to say, you know, we shouldn't kill grandma.
[03:34:29.960 --> 03:34:36.064]  It's not heroic to say to these leftists who go up in city council meetings and say, we're going to groom your kids, they belong to us.
[03:34:36.064 --> 03:34:38.786]  It's coming up for air.
[03:34:38.786 --> 03:34:41.828]  It's just living in the real world.
[03:34:41.828 --> 03:34:42.948]  This is unbelievable.
[03:34:42.948 --> 03:34:44.409]  We're going to your phone calls right now.
[03:34:44.409 --> 03:34:48.071]  And let's go to Lucas in North Carolina.
[03:34:48.071 --> 03:34:51.233]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:34:51.233 --> 03:34:51.954]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:34:51.954 --> 03:34:52.434]  Good to be on.
[03:34:52.434 --> 03:34:53.475]  Good to have you here.
[03:34:54.898 --> 03:34:57.340]  I rarely get a chance to listen to you live.
[03:34:57.340 --> 03:34:59.781]  I used to listen to you on YouTube.
[03:34:59.781 --> 03:35:02.443]  I like to listen at various times of the day.
[03:35:02.443 --> 03:35:07.906]  Obviously, you've been banned off there, and I downloaded the InfoWars app for Android.
[03:35:07.906 --> 03:35:12.609]  If other people want to listen at various times of the day, that's the way to go.
[03:35:12.609 --> 03:35:21.494]  Real quickly, before I get to my point, I just wanted to say that I am a user of the InfoWars products.
[03:35:21.494 --> 03:35:22.415]  First, I started with
[03:35:23.450 --> 03:35:24.750]  Super male vitality.
[03:35:24.750 --> 03:35:41.295]  I am a late 30s male, and I don't get all the time that I would like to work out as much as I do, and immediately noticed being able to retain strength and muscle mass from the use of super male vitality, so I want to thank you for that.
[03:35:41.295 --> 03:35:52.658]  And next, I tried X2, and it's nothing that you notice immediately, but it seemed over time I felt like I was more sharp from the iodine, being able to
[03:35:53.377 --> 03:35:55.340]  Retain short-term memory better.
[03:35:55.340 --> 03:35:58.824]  I just feel a little sharper in my day-to-day activities.
[03:36:01.989 --> 03:36:04.350]  I totally agree with you, Ian.
[03:36:04.350 --> 03:36:06.210]  It's the good halogen.
[03:36:06.210 --> 03:36:12.232]  IQs get reduced by 15 points without iodine in your development.
[03:36:12.232 --> 03:36:13.752]  People can look this up for themselves.
[03:36:13.752 --> 03:36:18.454]  And that's why the globalists are obsessed with making sure it's not in the food, it's not in the products we eat.
[03:36:18.454 --> 03:36:20.074]  We are just starving for iodine.
[03:36:20.074 --> 03:36:21.715]  That's why we came out with X2.
[03:36:21.715 --> 03:36:24.736]  We have X3 that's all three types, but this is the deep-earth crystal source.
[03:36:24.736 --> 03:36:25.956]  We now have it back in stock.
[03:36:26.536 --> 03:36:29.097]  And I haven't even plugged this hour since you mentioned it.
[03:36:29.097 --> 03:36:30.737]  We've got a bunch of specials.
[03:36:30.737 --> 03:36:32.038]  50% off running right now.
[03:36:32.038 --> 03:36:33.058]  Storewide free shipping.
[03:36:33.058 --> 03:36:34.799]  We have 60% off.
[03:36:34.799 --> 03:36:35.859]  Brain Force Plus.
[03:36:35.859 --> 03:36:37.760]  That's the special running right now.
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:39.360]  Sorry, go ahead.
[03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:39.980]  Oh, that's fine.
[03:36:39.980 --> 03:36:45.902]  That's precisely why I mentioned it because I'm listening to the app last night and you said I don't plug enough.
[03:36:45.902 --> 03:36:47.323]  I don't get a chance.
[03:36:47.323 --> 03:36:54.265]  At least you don't take the time because you're so busy talking about the topics in the news that you don't get to plug to Funny Info Wars.
[03:36:54.265 --> 03:36:54.945]  So I just want to
[03:36:55.438 --> 03:36:57.579]  Stick that in there real quick.
[03:36:57.579 --> 03:37:04.383]  Also, I bought the t-shirts, Re-Elect 45 and the Hillary for Prison, obviously one of the most popular.
[03:37:04.383 --> 03:37:10.667]  It's drawn so much attention, and I don't know if people believe it or not, but it's all positive attention.
[03:37:10.667 --> 03:37:17.471]  The main reaction that I got myself was from males 18 to 20 years old and middle-aged black women.
[03:37:17.471 --> 03:37:21.794]  Honestly to God, they were the ones commenting saying, I love that shirt.
[03:37:22.304 --> 03:37:27.507]  They would laugh about it, tell their friends about it when we were public there.
[03:37:27.507 --> 03:37:34.511]  But the main point I wanted to get to was the media demonization of yourself and InfoWars.
[03:37:34.511 --> 03:37:43.836]  And with that being said, one thing I know that you don't like to do is talk about yourself, but InfoWars is at the forefront of the attack from the media.
[03:37:44.537 --> 03:37:57.473]  And one of the things that they so often do, and this is what new listeners or non-listeners need to know, is they so often demonize you as being right-wing, right-wing conspiracy theorists, right-wing extremists.
[03:37:57.473 --> 03:38:01.819]  And I've been listening to you for probably eight or nine years now, and one thing that
[03:38:02.543 --> 03:38:05.924]  You know, you do not claim a political party.
[03:38:05.924 --> 03:38:07.525]  The left are crazy these days.
[03:38:07.525 --> 03:38:11.206]  If you have to choose a side to be on, I would align myself with the right.
[03:38:11.206 --> 03:38:18.228]  But what Alex Jones and the Infowars is is pro-Americana, pro-liberty, pro-freedom.
[03:38:18.228 --> 03:38:22.510]  And so often you're getting labeled as this right-wing, right-wing, right-wing.
[03:38:22.510 --> 03:38:24.751]  You are critical of the left or the right.
[03:38:24.751 --> 03:38:26.411]  There are crazy on each side.
[03:38:26.411 --> 03:38:28.212]  There are good on each side.
[03:38:28.212 --> 03:38:30.793]  You know, you were very critical of President Bush.
[03:38:32.108 --> 03:38:37.775]  Everything that happened with 9-11 and the war in the Middle East.
[03:38:37.775 --> 03:38:44.142]  You just have your unbiased opinion without having to lay claim to a certain political party.
[03:38:44.142 --> 03:38:45.804]  And I don't think people realize that.
[03:38:46.573 --> 03:38:50.795]  And I got behind Trump because he's done a lot of good.
[03:38:50.795 --> 03:38:56.499]  Getting us out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the transfer of our power to the globalists, trying to get jobs back.
[03:38:56.499 --> 03:38:59.020]  You know, a lot of good things Trump's done, trying to end these wars.
[03:38:59.020 --> 03:39:01.802]  I mean, Trump's light years better than Hillary.
[03:39:01.802 --> 03:39:03.883]  I just don't get why he doesn't defend the First Amendment.
[03:39:03.883 --> 03:39:06.264]  I mean, it's the huge blurring thing.
[03:39:06.264 --> 03:39:08.285]  It's illegal what they're doing.
[03:39:08.285 --> 03:39:09.626]  And it's absolutely out of control.
[03:39:09.626 --> 03:39:12.028]  God bless you and I appreciate your call and all the support, my friend.
[03:39:12.868 --> 03:39:16.391]  Okay, next, holding the longest, is Shawn and then Jessica.
[03:39:16.391 --> 03:39:18.592]  Shawn, you're on the air, go ahead.
[03:39:18.592 --> 03:39:21.194]  Hey, hi Alex, long time listener.
[03:39:21.194 --> 03:39:21.835]  Welcome.
[03:39:21.835 --> 03:39:27.199]  I have two things about abortion and the drag shows, and I'll make them quick.
[03:39:27.199 --> 03:39:37.126]  The best way to discredit the abortion supporters and their politicians is to get some of the most graphic, messed up footage of actual abortions in interviews of the mother.
[03:39:37.879 --> 03:39:47.301]  Once videos have been produced, you can release the videos on every social media platform, on multiple accounts, and BitTorrent two weeks before the presidential election.
[03:39:47.301 --> 03:39:50.462]  This will discredit the whole system.
[03:39:50.462 --> 03:40:03.285]  I agree with you that, especially with Hispanic voters, God bless them, they are against abortion because they love babies, good people, and they're trying to shell Hispanics on voting for Democrats, but now it's not just kill a baby,
[03:40:04.181 --> 03:40:06.382]  Before it's born, it's kill them after they're born.
[03:40:06.382 --> 03:40:14.524]  So I think we just get that out to Hispanic voters nationwide and say, hey, whatever BS you heard, Republicans aren't for killing babies after they're born.
[03:40:14.524 --> 03:40:17.624]  So you vote for Democrats, you vote for killing babies.
[03:40:17.624 --> 03:40:21.825]  And I can't believe the Democrats did this, but they're already selling the organs.
[03:40:21.825 --> 03:40:26.587]  They know it's coming out, so they need to legalize it or they're going to go to prison.
[03:40:26.587 --> 03:40:28.187]  See why they're in a hard place?
[03:40:31.149 --> 03:40:38.891]  Alright, and the second thing is, you cited several scientific articles proving that apazine is responsible for feminizing men.
[03:40:38.891 --> 03:40:53.394]  If the data proves the drug is responsible for the behavior, I think we as Christians should show compassion for the afflicted by going after the chemical companies responsible for the LGBT movement, not demonizing them.
[03:40:54.383 --> 03:41:02.172]  Well listen, I agree with you that, you know, quote, people like to name it homosexual, it's just a scientific name like heterosexual.
[03:41:02.172 --> 03:41:08.760]  Homosexuals are a whole spectrum of people, a lot of nice people, I'm not attacking those type of folks.
[03:41:08.760 --> 03:41:12.604]  But, and there's people that throughout history without chemicals are attracted to the same sex.
[03:41:13.445 --> 03:41:17.386]  And there is some studies that show some genetics on that front.
[03:41:17.386 --> 03:41:19.187]  I'm not getting into all that.
[03:41:19.187 --> 03:41:23.208]  I'm saying LGBT is turning into LBGTP.
[03:41:23.208 --> 03:41:34.631]  Atrazine is confusing the sex and is causing a massive explosion of people having issues.
[03:41:34.631 --> 03:41:37.811]  And David Hogg's response is, well good, it's good to have more gay people.
[03:41:37.811 --> 03:41:39.252]  Well you also get a higher risk of cancer.
[03:41:40.192 --> 03:41:45.494]  Uh, and so, yeah, it's affecting our brains, it's affecting our genitals, it's affecting women's breasts.
[03:41:45.494 --> 03:41:47.615]  Uh, you know, Atrazine gives women breast cancer.
[03:41:47.615 --> 03:41:48.816]  Roundup gives women breast cancer.
[03:41:48.816 --> 03:41:53.078]  It gives men, uh, you know, cancer of the prostate.
[03:41:53.078 --> 03:41:54.158]  And those are in the major studies.
[03:41:54.158 --> 03:41:56.699]  So I hear you and I appreciate you.
[03:41:56.699 --> 03:42:00.021]  I am not, let me tell you something right now, okay?
[03:42:00.021 --> 03:42:00.081]  Um...
[03:42:01.539 --> 03:42:04.980]  I'm married, I'm a good guy, but I'm a pig.
[03:42:04.980 --> 03:42:05.440]  Okay?
[03:42:05.440 --> 03:42:09.642]  And growing up and in between being divorced and stuff, I'm a wild man.
[03:42:09.642 --> 03:42:10.042]  Okay?
[03:42:10.042 --> 03:42:18.425]  And I think, on God's scale, you know, running around carousing with women is on par, you know, over here with guys with each other or whatever.
[03:42:18.425 --> 03:42:21.606]  I'm not even on people's tails about that.
[03:42:21.606 --> 03:42:22.846]  Okay?
[03:42:22.846 --> 03:42:26.968]  What I'm saying is, is that the globals are promoting it to hurt us.
[03:42:26.968 --> 03:42:30.429]  And the highest group of people committing suicide and dying alone are gay men.
[03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:39.272]  And the left doesn't want Christians to be able to reach out to them and try to help them and say, hey, if you don't like this lifestyle, you could get out of it.
[03:42:39.272 --> 03:42:41.113]  That's all I'm saying.
[03:42:41.113 --> 03:42:42.494]  And so I do not hate people.
[03:42:42.494 --> 03:42:46.635]  I'm not like, well, that guy, he loves God, so I'm going to beat his ass.
[03:42:46.635 --> 03:42:47.716]  Give me a break.
[03:42:47.716 --> 03:42:48.456]  Come on.
[03:42:48.456 --> 03:42:49.697]  That's not who I am.
[03:42:49.697 --> 03:42:51.938]  And I don't think you're saying that, but that's not who I am.
[03:42:51.938 --> 03:42:52.578]  More calls coming up.
[03:42:53.178 --> 03:42:57.820]  The globalists, the eugenicists, are always talking down to us.
[03:42:57.820 --> 03:43:02.082]  They're always trying to make us feel small, to feel insignificant.
[03:43:02.082 --> 03:43:10.026]  They try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your own decisions.
[03:43:10.026 --> 03:43:13.127]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[03:43:13.127 --> 03:43:16.609]  But the truth is, it is we the people and our ideas and our actions
[03:43:18.590 --> 03:43:18.830]  I think?
[03:43:41.867 --> 03:43:53.594]  I want to encourage listeners and viewers to understand that throughout the second half of the month of March, we're going to have store-wide free shipping at 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com, something everybody should take advantage of.
[03:43:53.594 --> 03:43:56.696]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[03:43:56.696 --> 03:43:59.597]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[03:43:59.597 --> 03:44:02.559]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:44:02.559 --> 03:44:06.701]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[03:44:06.701 --> 03:44:07.122]  We're the top
[03:44:08.177 --> 03:44:17.309]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[03:44:17.309 --> 03:44:22.676]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[03:44:22.676 --> 03:44:24.939]  We have those incredible sell prices back.
[03:44:24.939 --> 03:44:25.881]  InfoWorksTour.com.
[03:44:26.261 --> 03:44:26.561]  I think so.
[03:44:54.292 --> 03:44:56.534]  If you're not expanding, you're imploding.
[03:44:56.534 --> 03:44:58.275]  There is no set stasis.
[03:44:58.275 --> 03:44:59.516]  There is no managed system.
[03:44:59.516 --> 03:45:01.177]  There is no un-continuum.
[03:45:01.177 --> 03:45:04.399]  The continuum is always launching forward into the future.
[03:45:04.399 --> 03:45:07.741]  So you support us and get creative and get fired up.
[03:45:07.741 --> 03:45:09.002]  We won't just be here a hundred years.
[03:45:09.002 --> 03:45:09.783]  We'll be here forever.
[03:45:09.783 --> 03:45:11.044]  We'll turn the whole thing around.
[03:45:11.044 --> 03:45:17.928]  Our grandchildren on Mars bases and jump bases and God knows what are going to look back and say, you know, we struggled here.
[03:45:17.928 --> 03:45:18.489]  We made it.
[03:45:18.489 --> 03:45:20.650]  And that's really where this goes.
[03:45:20.650 --> 03:45:22.472]  God's got a big war for you, Reddy.
[03:45:22.472 --> 03:45:22.832]  And so,
[03:45:23.032 --> 03:45:29.634]  If you can't face George Soros and Hillary Clinton and Adolf Hitler and Mao Zedong, are you going to really be able to face the other stuff?
[03:45:29.634 --> 03:45:34.555]  Because God wants warriors that are smart and are ready to build things and are also ready to fight.
[03:45:34.555 --> 03:45:37.415]  You don't go to the next level without getting a big weight put on your back.
[03:45:37.415 --> 03:45:39.796]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[03:45:39.796 --> 03:45:43.297]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[03:45:43.297 --> 03:45:44.337]  I want to go to the next level.
[03:45:44.597 --> 03:45:47.724]  I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced.
[03:45:47.724 --> 03:45:48.886]  Not these devil worshippers.
[03:45:48.886 --> 03:45:51.571]  They're cold and failed and feels like being in a tomb.
[03:45:51.571 --> 03:45:52.834]  I want life!
[03:45:52.834 --> 03:45:53.675]  I want Jesus!
[03:46:03.464 --> 03:46:12.468]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:46:12.468 --> 03:46:22.551]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[03:46:22.551 --> 03:46:31.075]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[03:46:31.895 --> 03:46:33.256]  There's nothing else like it.
[03:46:33.256 --> 03:46:34.416]  You must experience it.
[03:46:34.416 --> 03:46:36.497]  It is a total game-changer.
[03:46:36.497 --> 03:46:41.399]  It comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:46:41.399 --> 03:46:42.940]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:46:42.940 --> 03:46:44.401]  It lasts 10 hours.
[03:46:44.401 --> 03:46:51.104]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[03:46:51.104 --> 03:46:57.687]  Turbo Force at m4slife.com.
[03:46:57.687 --> 03:47:00.368]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:07.279 --> 03:47:24.293]  The only two things in life that make it worth living Is guitars that tune good and firm feeling women I don't need my name in the marquee lights I got my song and I got you with me tonight
[03:47:25.464 --> 03:47:31.429]  Maybe it's time we got back to the basics of love.
[03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:33.430]  Let's go to Lukenbach, Texas.
[03:47:33.430 --> 03:47:38.054]  That is a pretty spot over in the hill country.
[03:47:38.054 --> 03:47:42.718]  Between Fredericksburg and Kerrville.
[03:47:42.718 --> 03:47:47.382]  This successful life we're living got us feuding like the Hatfields and McCall.
[03:47:47.382 --> 03:47:50.284]  Alright, we're gonna go back to your phone calls.
[03:47:50.284 --> 03:47:51.545]  Then the war room kicks up.
[03:47:51.545 --> 03:47:53.447]  I'll be back tonight, 8 o'clock.
[03:47:53.447 --> 03:47:54.708]  Bunch of big guests lined up.
[03:47:55.956 --> 03:47:59.657]  We're focusing on the First Amendment, how to defend it, how to take action.
[03:47:59.657 --> 03:48:05.618]  And the power of you, the listeners and viewers on AM and FM TV, Internet, tell them folks how you're listening, spread the word.
[03:48:05.618 --> 03:48:06.158]  It's beautiful.
[03:48:06.158 --> 03:48:12.140]  Via your email, via your text message, call mom up, call your son up, call your brother up, call your husband up, call your neighbor up.
[03:48:12.140 --> 03:48:14.360]  Tell them, hey, you've heard about this guy getting demonized.
[03:48:14.360 --> 03:48:17.301]  Find out what they're talking about.
[03:48:17.301 --> 03:48:19.702]  But we're talking about them making their move against our children.
[03:48:19.702 --> 03:48:20.602]  That's why they want to shut down.
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:34.885]  Briefly, we've got store-wide free shipping, 50% off all the supplements, but every hour, and because I did this a lot late, I'm going to extend a lot of these for a few more hours, we have 60% off RainForce Plus, the great nootropic.
[03:48:34.885 --> 03:48:42.668]  We have 55% off all super blue, colloidal silver, iodine fortified, toothpaste, mouthwash, immune gargle, all fluoride-free.
[03:48:42.668 --> 03:48:44.409]  Biggest discount ever on that.
[03:48:44.409 --> 03:48:48.310]  And we've got a bunch of other big specials running at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-7000.
[03:48:50.671 --> 03:48:50.691]  3139.
[03:48:50.691 --> 03:48:53.592]  There's also a mailing address there on the site.
[03:48:53.592 --> 03:48:57.033]  Any orders that come in the next few days will be locked in at those prices.
[03:48:57.033 --> 03:49:01.975]  But again, just buy your toothpaste, buy your coffee, buy your energy bars, buy your whatever from us.
[03:49:01.975 --> 03:49:05.356]  And that lets us stand against the incredible stuff behind the scenes.
[03:49:05.356 --> 03:49:06.517]  I'm not complaining.
[03:49:06.517 --> 03:49:10.458]  I expected this, but it's James Bond level every day.
[03:49:10.458 --> 03:49:16.280]  Just keeping the wheels rolling to stay on air is the treachery, the manipulation, the
[03:49:16.980 --> 03:49:20.402]  The darkness is incredible, but God always comes through.
[03:49:20.402 --> 03:49:22.464]  So number one, please pray for us.
[03:49:22.464 --> 03:49:25.666]  All right, I've got loaded phones here still trying to get to everybody.
[03:49:25.666 --> 03:49:27.026]  Appreciate everybody holding.
[03:49:27.026 --> 03:49:28.968]  Let's talk to Jessica.
[03:49:28.968 --> 03:49:30.489]  You're on the air from Virginia.
[03:49:30.489 --> 03:49:32.850]  Welcome.
[03:49:32.850 --> 03:49:35.332]  Hi, Alex.
[03:49:35.332 --> 03:49:38.254]  First of all, I'd like to say you're so on fire today.
[03:49:38.254 --> 03:49:39.134]  So on point.
[03:49:41.053 --> 03:49:45.534]  And when you're like that, it just scares my spirit even more.
[03:49:45.534 --> 03:49:50.576]  So, I think that, you know, sometimes you apologize for that, but we need it.
[03:49:50.576 --> 03:49:55.938]  Because there's so many people that are just so zombified, so asleep, that we have to have something.
[03:49:55.938 --> 03:50:05.801]  It's like, sometimes people need a slap in the face, rather than, you know, like a gentle little waking up.
[03:50:05.801 --> 03:50:06.741]  No, I agree.
[03:50:06.741 --> 03:50:09.222]  We need to get that ice water thrown on us.
[03:50:10.111 --> 03:50:12.232]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[03:50:12.232 --> 03:50:34.260]  And I think that, especially right now, with all of the, you know, fake news and all of the indoctrination, all of the poisoning of the mind, we have to have that, you know, on a larger scale.
[03:50:34.260 --> 03:50:38.682]  But I was listening to you talking about, you know,
[03:50:39.226 --> 03:51:00.255]  Spending time with God and your alone time with God and I think that is so important before you do something like what you do and how you're attacked and things like that because spirit speaks to spirit and so that's helping us who are of like spirit who are in Christ really
[03:51:02.853 --> 03:51:08.919]  Connect with one another and you're connecting with what you're doing.
[03:51:08.919 --> 03:51:11.061]  The problem is you get really close to God at 3 a.m.
[03:51:11.061 --> 03:51:12.021]  or 6 a.m.
[03:51:12.021 --> 03:51:20.629]  and then you cook breakfast deal with traffic come into work look at all the articles and you kind of lose God again focusing just on all the minutiae when it really just comes back to God.
[03:51:20.629 --> 03:51:24.593]  Yeah but I think that's in a big way because that's
[03:51:25.151 --> 03:51:32.595]  I pray all the time, all the time for the InfoWars crew, for the President, because we know how much you're under attack.
[03:51:32.595 --> 03:51:37.298]  So I just want to encourage everyone who is listening, please pray for Alex.
[03:51:37.298 --> 03:51:50.365]  Please pray for David Knight, the entire InfoWars crew, and our President, and these people who really are trying to fight against this terrible Babylonian worshipping
[03:51:52.129 --> 03:51:56.451]  Because if it's not for you guys, we're lost.
[03:51:56.451 --> 03:52:00.514]  Well, we're lost without you, the audience, because this is a place where the audience is the audience.
[03:52:00.514 --> 03:52:01.295]  You are everything.
[03:52:01.295 --> 03:52:02.475]  God bless you and thank you, Jessica.
[03:52:02.475 --> 03:52:03.616]  Beautiful call.
[03:52:03.616 --> 03:52:04.937]  Thank you for your support.
[03:52:04.937 --> 03:52:05.697]  We're in this together.
[03:52:05.697 --> 03:52:08.980]  Who's been holding the next longest here?
[03:52:08.980 --> 03:52:11.201]  Trying to go fast with everybody.
[03:52:11.201 --> 03:52:12.822]  Lee in Idaho, you're on the air.
[03:52:12.822 --> 03:52:13.402]  Thanks for holding.
[03:52:13.402 --> 03:52:15.504]  Then Shelby.
[03:52:15.504 --> 03:52:16.144]  Hey, brother.
[03:52:16.144 --> 03:52:18.346]  It's really good to talk to you.
[03:52:18.346 --> 03:52:18.646]  Thank you.
[03:52:19.895 --> 03:52:22.197]  Yeah, I just wanted to say one thing.
[03:52:22.197 --> 03:52:32.245]  I think where we're really wrong on this abortion issue as Americans is that we're killing an American citizen in private.
[03:52:32.245 --> 03:52:45.316]  If you really think about it... Yeah, there's no judge, there's no jury, and the governor who's a doctor says, we don't want government involved, we don't want courts involved, just give us the babies.
[03:52:45.316 --> 03:52:46.097]  How creepy is that?
[03:52:47.685 --> 03:52:58.516]  It's really creepy because our federal government's first duty is to protect every citizen's right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[03:52:58.516 --> 03:53:08.185]  And we have one group of citizens in the United States that's the most vulnerable and defenseless that are not getting those rights protected.
[03:53:10.273 --> 03:53:11.254]  No, you make a great point.
[03:53:11.254 --> 03:53:12.515]  They have a constitutional right.
[03:53:12.515 --> 03:53:16.958]  We talk about black people or white people or Native Americans having rights to vote or whatever.
[03:53:16.958 --> 03:53:19.961]  How about a right to not be chopped up after you're born?
[03:53:19.961 --> 03:53:21.382]  Or kept alive when your organs are taken?
[03:53:21.382 --> 03:53:23.523]  This is so fundamental and it just shows.
[03:53:23.523 --> 03:53:34.151]  I remember the old-timers, like 20-something years ago, were like, Alex, soon they'll be teaching kids sex and they'll have, you know, a nambla in the schools and they'll be
[03:53:35.365 --> 03:53:38.047]  Yeah, the crazies are running the nut farm.
[03:53:38.047 --> 03:53:39.609]  I just think that, you know, I want legislation.
[03:53:39.609 --> 03:53:40.449]  I want somebody who's
[03:53:54.304 --> 03:53:59.508]  I think there needs to be a bureaucracy formed and you need to have a liaison at every Planned Parenthood because you should not be able to end a citizen's life
[03:54:15.751 --> 03:54:16.351]  No, I hear you.
[03:54:16.351 --> 03:54:24.217]  And by the way, I don't want violence offensively, but how does Congress or any of these groups stand up when they're killing babies after they're born?
[03:54:24.217 --> 03:54:27.900]  How are they going to say it's wrong if somebody attacks them?
[03:54:27.900 --> 03:54:31.342]  Because, you know, it's just the universe doesn't put up with this.
[03:54:31.342 --> 03:54:32.363]  God doesn't put up with it.
[03:54:32.363 --> 03:54:33.344]  Powerful point.
[03:54:33.344 --> 03:54:35.285]  Thank you, Lee.
[03:54:35.285 --> 03:54:38.968]  Listen, we've got a bunch of callers here.
[03:54:38.968 --> 03:54:43.231]  We got Dustin, we got Shelby, we got Randy, we got Matthew, we got Knowledge.
[03:54:43.231 --> 03:54:44.432]  I'm trying to get to everybody.
[03:54:45.804 --> 03:54:46.725]  Who's been on the longest?
[03:54:46.725 --> 03:54:48.986]  It'll be Randy.
[03:54:48.986 --> 03:54:50.506]  Other callers, call me back at 8 o'clock tonight.
[03:54:50.506 --> 03:54:51.527]  I'll go right to you, I promise.
[03:54:51.527 --> 03:54:53.448]  In fact, even write down their names and numbers if you want.
[03:54:53.448 --> 03:54:55.809]  I'll put them on first tonight at 8 o'clock when I come back.
[03:54:55.809 --> 03:54:56.850]  We're a 50-hour broadcast.
[03:54:56.850 --> 03:54:58.510]  Owen's coming up, a bunch of others.
[03:54:58.510 --> 03:55:00.871]  But let me try to jam in one more right now.
[03:55:00.871 --> 03:55:02.712]  Who's been on the longest here?
[03:55:02.712 --> 03:55:03.793]  Randy in Indiana.
[03:55:03.793 --> 03:55:05.334]  Go ahead, Randy.
[03:55:05.334 --> 03:55:06.034]  Oh, great.
[03:55:06.034 --> 03:55:06.674]  Am I on?
[03:55:06.674 --> 03:55:07.635]  Yes, sir.
[03:55:07.635 --> 03:55:08.175]  Okay.
[03:55:08.175 --> 03:55:10.116]  I'm going to make this as quick as I can.
[03:55:11.484 --> 03:55:13.466]  The United States started the internet.
[03:55:13.466 --> 03:55:17.008]  Google came off the internet and that's what they're using.
[03:55:17.008 --> 03:55:23.953]  If they help the Chinese military in any direction, Trump can hold that company and the CEO for treason.
[03:55:23.953 --> 03:55:34.360]  Second thing is, these companies are going over there to China and transferring technology to these companies.
[03:55:34.360 --> 03:55:35.861]  Which is treason!
[03:55:35.861 --> 03:55:37.182]  Which is treason because if they
[03:55:39.247 --> 03:55:43.628]  Manufactured anything to the US military that was secret, that's treason.
[03:55:43.628 --> 03:55:48.269]  If you or I worked at Google and we gave it to a private company, we'd go to jail.
[03:55:48.269 --> 03:55:50.429]  How do they give it to a dictatorship?
[03:55:50.429 --> 03:55:51.349]  That's exactly right.
[03:55:51.349 --> 03:55:52.409]  But here's the other thing.
[03:55:52.409 --> 03:55:54.150]  China is not forcing them.
[03:55:54.150 --> 03:55:57.530]  China's saying, look, we're going to give you a whole bunch of cheap labor.
[03:55:57.530 --> 03:56:00.171]  You won't hardly have to pay anything for the labor.
[03:56:00.171 --> 03:56:03.872]  And China is wanting all that manufacturing over there they can.
[03:56:03.872 --> 03:56:05.732]  If you remember right during World War II,
[03:56:06.502 --> 03:56:13.647]  The only reason we beat the Germans, their tanks were ten times better of ours, but we built them Sherbins and there's just too many of them.
[03:56:13.647 --> 03:56:14.948]  We've come like ants.
[03:56:14.948 --> 03:56:18.710]  Now, the second thing I've got to tell you, and I'm trying to make this quick.
[03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:29.717]  During World War II, you had General Motors, you had Ford, the Ford transmission could be interchanged with theirs, you had IBM, and you had the Bushes, which was a Nazi.
[03:56:29.717 --> 03:56:33.660]  Prescott Bush financed the Nazis, and Roosevelt,
[03:56:34.164 --> 03:56:37.946]  Well, I believe that Trump's going to come after these companies.
[03:56:37.946 --> 03:56:39.187]  I really believe that.
[03:56:39.187 --> 03:56:40.248]  He sure as hell needs to.
[03:56:40.248 --> 03:56:44.190]  And he needs to go after Google because she's letting him off the hook.
[03:56:44.190 --> 03:56:46.771]  And if they had any way helped the Chinese military, they
[03:57:04.116 --> 03:57:05.898]  Treason is punishable by death.
[03:57:25.836 --> 03:57:30.578]  I can't get into it on air, but it's just, we're gonna, we're gonna, God always comes through, through you.
[03:57:30.578 --> 03:57:34.319]  So please, InfoWarsTore.com, get the staples you need and help fund us.
[03:57:34.319 --> 03:57:35.200]  Thank you.

[03:57:35.760 --> 03:57:36.820]  I appreciate you.
[03:57:36.820 --> 03:57:37.921]  Great job to the crew.
[03:57:37.921 --> 03:57:39.902]  The War Room's coming up in the 50-hour broadcast.
[03:57:39.902 --> 03:57:40.422]  Spread the links.
[03:57:40.422 --> 03:57:40.682]  Thank you.
[03:57:52.523 --> 03:58:01.525]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[03:58:01.525 --> 03:58:11.606]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[03:58:25.427 --> 03:58:30.491]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[03:58:30.491 --> 03:58:32.012]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[03:58:32.012 --> 03:58:33.473]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[03:58:33.473 --> 03:58:40.178]  So take a half-pack the first time you take it because TurboForce is named TurboForce because it will take you into overdrive.

[03:58:44.481 --> 03:58:47.584]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[03:58:47.584 --> 03:58:49.105]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[03:58:50.477 --> 03:58:53.424]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
